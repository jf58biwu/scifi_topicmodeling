Day one , Greenie . Rise and shine . ( BOY LAUGHING ) He looks like a slopper to me . ( ALL CHATTERING ) I could use some help in the kitchen . ( BOYS LAUGHING AND CHATTERING ) ( GRUNTING ) BOYS : ( SHOUTING ) on ! Hey , we got a runner ! ( PANTING ) ( GROANS ) BOYS : Oh ! ( ALL LAUGHING ) ( BOY WHOOPING ) BOY 1 : Take it all in . ( BOYS CHEERING AND APPLAUDING ) ( GASPS ) ( GRUNTING ) ( LOCKS DOOR ) BOY : He 's all yours . Hey - ( GASPS ) Hey there , Green Bean . You 're not gonna run again . Okay ? Good . ( UNLOCKS DOOR ) ( CLEARS THROAT ) My name is Alby . Can you tell me anything about yourself ? Who you are ? Where you came from ? Anything at all . No . Can you tell me your name ? I , uh , I can 't remember anything . Why can 't I remember anything ? It 's okay . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Hey , relax . Relax . It 's normal . ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) It happens to us all . You 'll get your name back in a day or two . It 's the one thing they let us keep . What is this place ? Let me show you . ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) ALBY : We eat here . We sleep here . We grow our own food . We build our own shelter . Whatever we need , the Box provides . The rest is up to us . The Box ? Yeah . It 's sent up once a month With fresh supplies and a new Greenie . This month that 's you . Congratulations . Sent up ? By who , though ? Who put us here ? That , we don 't know . Hey , are you all right , Alby ? A-ha ! Green Bean , meet Newt . When I 'm not around , he 's in charge . Well , it 's a good thing you 're always around then . That was some dash you made earlier . For a second , I thought you had the chops to be a runner till you face-planted . ( LAUGHS ) That was great . Wait , a " runner " ? Newt , do me a favor . Go find Chuck . All right . Thanks . Look , I 'm sorry to rush this . You came up a little late , and there 's a lot to do . We got something special planned tonight . Yeah . You 'll see . I hope you 're not afraid of heights . Let 's go . Come on . This is all we got . We 've worked hard for it . If you respect this place ... you and I will get along just fine . What 's out there ? We only have three rules . First , do your part . No time for any freeloaders . Second , never harm another Glader . None of this works unless we have trust . Most importantly ... never go beyond those walls . Do you understand me , Greenie ? CHUCK : Hey , Alby ! Hey , Chuck . Where you been , man ? It 's basically the same story for all of us . We wake up in the Box , Alby gives us the tour ... then here we are . Don 't worry . You 're already doing better than I did . I clunked my pants three times before they got me out of the pit . No , come on . Dude , where are you going ? I just wanna see . You can look around all you want but you better not go out there . Why not ? What 's through there ? I don 't know . I just know what I 'm told . And we 're not supposed to leave . ( SIGHS ) BEN : Hey , Chuck . New Greenie , huh ? How does it feel to be promoted ? Feels great , Ben . I thought no one was allowed to leave . I said we 're not allowed to leave . They 're different , they 're runners . They know more about the maze than anyone . Wait , what ? What ? What ? You just said " maze . " I did ? Yeah . Where are you going ? What are you doing ? I 'm just gonna take a look . I told you , you can 't . No one leaves , especially not now . It 's not safe . Okay , all right , I 'm not gonna go . Hey ! ( GRUNTS ) ( WHIMPERS ) We gotta stop meeting like this , Greenie . Get off me ! All right ! Calm , calm , calm . BOY : Don 't touch me ! GALLY : Whoa ! Take it easy ! Just relax . What the hell is wrong with you guys ? Just calm down , all right ? No , okay ? Why won 't you tell me what 's out there ? We 're just trying to protect you . It 's for your own good . You guys can 't just keep me here . I can 't let you leave . Why not ? ( FAINT CLICK ) ( HEAVY THUD ) ( WIND WHOOSHING ) ( PANTING ) What the hell ? ( GEARS TURNING ) Next time , I 'm gonna let you leave . Welcome to the Glade . ( DRUMS PLAYING ) Light him up ! ( ALL CHEERING ) ( WHOOPING ) ( LAUGHS ) ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) Hell of a first day , Greenie . Here . Put some hair on your chest . ( SPITS ) Oh ! ( LAUGHS ) ( COUGHING ) Oh , my God ! What is that ? ( CONTINUES COUGHING ) I don 't even know . It 's Gally 's recipe . It 's a trade secret . ( BOYS SHOUTING ) Yeah , well , he 's still an asshole . He saved your life today . Trust me . The maze is a dangerous place . We 're trapped here , aren 't we ? For the moment . But ... you see those guys ? There , by the fire ? Those are the runners . That guy in the middle there , that 's Minho . He 's the Keeper of the Runners . Every morning , when those doors open , they run the maze ... mapping it , memorizing it , trying to find a way out . How long have they been looking ? Three years . And they haven 't found anything ? It 's a lot easier said than done . Listen . ( DISTANT CREAKING ) Hear that ? It 's the maze , changing . It changes every night . How is that even possible ? You can ask the people who put us in here , if you ever meet the bastards . Listen , the truth is ... the runners are the only ones who really know what 's out there . They are the strongest and the fastest of us all . And it 's a good thing , too ... because if they don 't make it back before those doors close ... then they are stuck out there for the night . And no one has ever survived a night in the maze . What happens to them ? Well , we call them Grievers . Of course , no one 's ever seen one and lived to tell about it . But they 're out there . Right , that 's enough questions for one night . Come on . You 're supposed to be the guest of honor . Oh , no ... No ! No , come on . Let me show you around . Come on . ( GRUNTING ) ALL : ( CHEERING ) Whoa ! And there we got the builders . They 're very good with their hands ... but not a lot going on upstairs . And then we got Winston ... he 's the Keeper of the Slicers . And we got two med-jacks , Clint and Jeff . Hey , what 's up ? Yo , Newt . They spend most of their time bandaging up the slicers . What if I want to be a runner ? ( CHUCKLES ) Have you listened to a word I 've just said ? No one wants to be a runner . And , besides , you gotta get chosen . Chosen by who ? ( GROANS ) BOYS : Whoa ! What do you say , Greenie ? Wanna see what you 're made of ? ( ALL CHANTING ) Greenie ! Greenie ! Greenie ! ( CHANTING CONTINUES ) ( ALL CHEERING ) Okay . All right . The rules are simple , Greenie . I try to push you out of the circle ... you try to last more than five seconds . ( ALL LAUGHING ) BOY 1 : Take it easy on the Greenie . GALLY : Ready ? ( GRUNTING ) ( BOYS SHOUTING ) ( COUGHS ) BOY 2 : Get up , boy . Come on , Greenie . We 're not done yet . Stop calling me Greenie . GALLY : Stop calling you that ? What do you wanna be called ? Shank ? ( BOYS LAUGHING AND CHEERING ) What do you think , boys ? Does he look like a Shank ? ( BOTH GRUNTING ) BOYS : Whoa ! BOY 3 : Come on ! You know what ? I think I 've settled on Shank . ( BOYS LAUGHING ) BOYS : Oh ! There you go , Greenie ! Not bad for a Greenie , huh ? Oh ! ( COUGHS ) ( BOYS CHATTERING ) Thomas . Thomas . Hey ! Thomas ! ( THOMAS LAUGHS ) I remember my name . I 'm Thomas ! ALL : Thomas ! ( ALL CHEERING ) Welcome home , Thomas . ( INAUDIBLE ) Good job ... Thomas . ( DISTANT ROARING ) What the hell was that ? That , my friend , was a Griever . Don 't worry , you 're safe here with us . Nothing gets through those walls . All right , guys - Let 's tuck it in for the night . Come on . It was a good night . Good job , man . GALLY : You 're safe here with us . WOMAN : Wicked is good . THOMAS : What 's out there ? GIRL : Thomas , Thomas . Can you hear me ? Everything is going to change . ALBY : Thomas . Shh . Follow me . ALBY : It 's peaceful , isn 't it ? I know it 's hard to believe , but it wasn 't always this way . We had dark days . We lost a lot of boys to fear . To panic . We 've come far since then . Established order ... made peace . Yeah . Why are you telling me this ? Because you 're not like the others . You 're curious . But you 're one of us now . You need to know what that means . What happened to them ? Like I said ... dark days , Thomas . Has anyone tried climbing to the top ? Tried it . The ivy doesn 't go all the way to the top . And besides , where are you gonna go from there ? And what about the Box ? You know , next time it comes up ... No , we tried that . The Box won 't go back down with someone in it . Okay , what if we ... No , we tried it , all right ? Twice . All right ? Trust me . Anything you think of , we 've already tried . The only way out of here is through the maze . Now , look , you wanna be helpful ? Here . Go dig us up some more fertilizer . " Just get the fertilizer , Thomas . " " Are you sure , guys ? I can 't help in any other way ? " " No , just get the fertilizer . " You know where it is . It 's just out in the middle of the woods . " ( FLIES BUZZING ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Oh ! ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Uh ... You 're Ben , right ? I don 't know if we ever ... ( GRUNTING ) Are you okay ? ( SHOUTS ) ( GROANS ) Get the hell off me ! It 's your fault . I saw you . You did this . I saw you ! ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( SCREAMS ) ( CHOKING ) ( GASPING ) Hey ! Hey ! THOMAS : Hey ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! I 'll kill you ! ( BOYS SHOUTING ) ( SCREAMS ) NEWT : Hey ! Hold him down . What are you doing ? ( GRUNTING ) Calm down , Ben . What the hell happened ? He just attacked me ! Are you okay ? ( MOANING ) GALLY : Calm down , Ben . No . No . All right , lift his shirt . Lift his shirt . ( GROANING ) No ! No ! No ! No ! Please . Please . ( BEN PANTING ) He 's been stung . In the middle of the day ? Help me , please . ( CRYING ) Please . Please , just help . ( SIGHS ) Put him in the pit . GALLY : Everybody , help . Take him to the pit . No ! Med-Jack ! Please don 't do it ! Calm down , Ben . Back down , Ben . Listen to me ! Please ! ( BEN SCREAMING ) Please , stop , please ! He did this ! Please stop ! No ! No , please ! Help me ! THOMAS : So what happened to him ? It 's called " The Changing . " It 's what happens when someone gets stung . Listen . We haven 't been able to get a clear word out of Ben since it happened . He 's not making any sense . And it 's only gonna get worse . The infection is spreading . He 's dangerous . What did he say to you ? He said he saw me ... and that this was all my fault . How could this be my fault ? Get some rest . Alby ? Yeah . What 's gonna happen to him ? ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Just listen to me . Just , please , listen to me ! Please , Minho ! ( GROWLING ) Alby ! ( BEN CONTINUES GROWLING ) ( WHEEZING ) ( SOBBING ) ( COUGHING ) No , please . Please , don 't . Please , don 't do it . ( BEN SOBBING ) ( GEARS TURNING ) ( WIND WHOOSHING ) ( WHIMPERING ) Poles ! ( GROWLING ) Move in ! No , no , no ! Please ! No , please ! Please , don 't ! I can get better ! Please , just listen to me ! Please , stop , please ! ALBY : Push him in ! Stop ! ( BEN CRYING ) I 'll get better ! ( BOYS GRUNTING ) ( WHIMPERING ) ( SOBBING ) ( PLEADING ) ( SCREAMING ) He belongs to the maze now . THOMAS : Do you think he might make it ? Ben ? No . No one survives a night in the maze . We just gotta forget about him . GIRL : Thomas . WOMAN : Wicked is good . Don 't make it easy on them . GIRL : Thomas . Everything is going to change . THOMAS : Wicked is good . MALE SCIENTIST : This is gonna hurt a little . WOMAN : Wicked is good . Thomas , you have to choose . ( GEARS TURNING ) THOMAS : But why would Alby go into the maze ? I mean , he 's not a runner . NEWT : Things are different now . Alby went to retrace Ben 's footsteps before sundown . Are you gonna help ? So he 's gonna go back to where Ben was just stung ... Alby knows what he 's doing ... all right ? He knows better than any of us . What does that mean ? Well , it 's like you have heard , yeah ? Every month , the Box sends up a new arrival . But someone had to be first , right ? Someone had to have spent a whole month in the Glade , alone . That was Alby . I mean , it can 't have been easy . But when those other boys started coming up , one after the other ... he saw the truth . And he learned that the most important thing ... is that we all have each other . Because we 're all in this together . Yeah . There you go , Greenie . ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) THOMAS : They should be back by now . What happens if they don 't make it ? They 're gonna make it . What happens if they don 't ? They 're gonna make it . Come on , guys , can 't we send someone after them ? GALLY : That 's against the rules . Either they make it back or they don 't . We can 't risk losing anyone else . ( WIND WHOOSHING ) Oh , no . ( BOYS MURMURING ) There ! ( MINHO GRUNTING LOUDLY ) Wait , something 's wrong . ( GRUNTING ) Come on , Minho , you can do it ! ALL : Come on ! Go ! CHUCK : Come on , you can make it ! Minho , you gotta leave him ! They 're not gonna make it . ( BOYS SHOUTING ) You gotta leave him ! ( YELLING ) ( INAUDIBLE ) CHUCK : Thomas , no ! ( THOMAS GRUNTING ) ( BOYS SHOUTING ) ( PANTING ) Good job . You just killed yourself . What ? ( PANTING ) What happened to him ? What does it look like ? He got stung . What happened to his head ? I did what I had to do . ( DISTANT ROARING ) ( GRUNTING ) Okay . Okay , help me get him up . We gotta go . The maze is already changing . Hey , Minho ! We can 't just leave him here . THOMAS : We gotta get him up . ( BOTH GRUNTING ) Come on . Just sit him down . Sit him down . ( DISTANT ROARING ) This isn 't going to work . We gotta go . We gotta go ! Wait , what are you talking about ? We gotta hide him . Where ? I don 't know . Are you telling me there 's not a single place we could take him ? ( GRUNTS IN FRUSTRATION ) Listen to me , shuck-face , all right . Take a look around . There 's nowhere to go ! ( BOTH PANTING ) You don 't get it . We 're already dead . ( GRUNTING ) Two , three ... ( BOTH GRUNTING ) Two , three ... Okay - ( MAZE WALLS SHIFTING ) What are you doing ? What are you doing ? What are you doing ? We gotta go . We gotta go now ! No , no , just a little more and we 'll tie it off . ( GROWLING ) Minho , stay with me . ( YELPS ) Stay with me , Minho . Just a little more , we 're almost there . I 'm sorry , Greenie . What ? Minho ! ( YELPING ) ( DISTANT ROARING ) ( WHIMPERS ) ( GRUNTING ) ( SCUTTLING ) ( ROARING ) ( GASPING ) Okay - ( GRUNTING ) Come on . ( PANTING ) ( CREATURE RETREATING ) ( WALLS SHIFTING ) ( DISTANT ROARING ) ( SQUISHES ) Whoa ! ( SCREAMS ) ( ROARS ) ( PANTING ) Oh ! Oh , shit ! ( SCREAMS ) Whoa ! ( PANTING ) Whoa ! ( ROARING ) ( YELLS ) ( GRUNTING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( GROANS ) ( GASPS ) You 're a crazy son of a bitch . Come on , follow me . Come on ! ( BOTH PANTING ) ( WALLS SHIFTING ) Okay , it 's changing . Come on , come on ! This section is closing . Come on . We can lose it down here ! Thomas ! What are you waiting for ? Get out of there ! ( ROARING ) Come on ! Come on ! Come on , Thomas ! Don 't look back ! Run ! ( SCREAMS ) Move it , Thomas ! Go on ! Move your ass ! Let 's go ! Come on ! Come on , Greenie ! Let 's go ! Thomas ! Guys , get up ! I told you , Chuck . They 're not coming back . BOY : Let 's go . No way . Yeah ! Yes ! Yeah ! ( BOYS EXCLAIMING IN SURPRISE ) I got him , I got him , I got him . Watch out . Easy . What happened out there ? How did you guys make it out ? You saw a Griever ? Yeah , I saw one . He didn 't just see it . He killed it . ( BOYS CHATTERING EXCITEDLY ) Things are changing . ( BOYS SHUSHING ) There 's no denying that . First , Ben gets stung in broad daylight . And then Alby . And now our Greenie , here , has taken it upon himself ... to go into the maze . Which is a clear violation of our rules here . Yeah ... but he saved Alby 's life . Did he ? For 3 years , we have coexisted with these things . And now , you 've killed one of them . Who knows what that could mean for us . What do you suggest we do ? He has to be punished . ( BOYS PROTESTING ) Come on . He killed a Griever ! Minho . You were there with him . What do you think ? I think ... in all the time we 've been here ... no one has ever killed a Griever before . When I turned tail and ran ... this dumb shank stayed behind to help Alby . Look , I don 't know if he 's brave or stupid . But whatever it is , we need more of it . I say we make him a runner . FRY : A runner ? What ? ( BOYS CHATTERING ) Minho , let 's not jump the gun , here . Thomas ! Thomas ! Thomas ! If you want to throw the newbie a parade , that 's fine . Go ahead . But if there is one thing I know about the maze ... it is that you do not ... ( BOYS SHOUTING ) Okay , wait . I know that sound . The Box . It 's coming back up . It shouldn 't be . ( SHOUTING CONTINUES ) FRY : Newt , what do you see ? BOY 1 : Do you see it ? It 's a girl . ( BOYS EXCLAIMING IN SURPRISE ) BOY 2 : No way . NEWT : I think she 's dead . What 's in her hand ? " She 's the last one ... ever . " What the hell does that mean ? ( GASPING ) ALL : Whoa ! ( PANTING ) Thomas ... Do you still think I 'm overreacting ? ( ALBY BREATHING HEAVILY ) NEWT : Jeff , what 's going on ? What 's the matter with her ? Why won 't she wake up ? Hey man , I got my job the same way you did . Do you recognize her ? No . Really ? Because she seemed to recognize you . What about the note ? We 'll worry about the note later . I think you should worry about it now . We 've got enough to deal with at the moment . He 's right , Newt . If the Box isn 't coming back up , how long do you think we can last ? No one said that . Let 's not jump to any conclusions . We 'll just wait until she wakes up and see what she knows . Somebody has gotta have some answers around here . Okay - Where are you going ? Back into the maze . Hey - Hey , Thomas . What is this with you , huh ? A death wish ? You just got out and now you want back in ? ( SIGHS ) Newt said that no one has ever seen a Griever and lived to tell about it , right ? Minho , now we have one . You 're telling me you 're not even a little bit curious ? Not really , no . So , what 's the plan ? You 're gonna go out and dissect that thing all by yourself ? I will if I have to . Have the other runners left yet ? The other runners quit this morning . ( SIGHS ) After Alby got stung , they 're not in any hurry to get back out there . Why are you ? I think it 's time we find out what we 're really up against . All right . But you 're not going back out there alone . Meet me in the woods in half-an-hour . ( EXHALES ) Will this be enough ? Okay - Let 's go . Come on ! That 's disgusting . There 's something in there . You mean , besides a Griever pancake ? Whoa , what are you doing ? ALL : Whoa ! I thought you said it was dead . Was it a reflex ? You hope . Okay , come on . Let 's try and pull it out . Everyone get a hand on it . Come on . All right , ready ? On three . One , two , three ! ( ALL GRUNTING ) ( ALL PANTING ) Are you okay , Fry ? Yeah . Thanks , brother . ( BOYS GROANING IN DISGUST ) What the hell is that ? Interesting . FRY : Okay , whatever it is ... can we take this up back at the Glade ? Because I don 't want to meet this guy 's friends . He 's right . It 's getting late . Come on . THOMAS : We found this . It was inside a Griever . These are the same letters we get in our supplies . Yeah . Whoever put us here obviously made the Grievers . This is the first real clue , the first anything , you 've found in over 3 years . Right , Minho ? Right . THOMAS : Newt , we gotta go back out there . Who knows where this might lead us . You see what he 's trying to do , right ? First he breaks our rules ... and then he tries to convince us to abandon them totally . The rules are the only thing that have ever held us together . Why now are we questioning that ? If Alby was here , you know he 'd agree with me . This shank needs to be punished . You 're right . Thomas broke the rules . One night in the pit , and no food . Come on , Newt ! One night in the pit ? Do you think that 's gonna stop him from going into the maze ? No . And we can 't just have non-runners running into the maze whenever they feel like it . So let 's just make this official . Starting from tomorrow , you 're a runner . Wow . Gally ... No , Fry . Thanks , Newt . Hey , where are we going ? You 'll see . ( SIGHS ) It 's the maze . All of it . What do you mean " all of it " ? I thought you were still mapping it . There 's nothing left to map . I 've run every inch of it myself . Every cycle . Every pattern . If there was a way out , we would have found it by now . Why haven 't you told anyone this ? It was Alby 's call . People needed to believe we had a chance of getting out . But maybe now ... we have a real chance . ( SIGHS ) Take a look at this . About a year ago , we started exploring these outer sections . We found these numbers printed on the walls . Sections 1 through 8 . See , the way it works , is every night , when the maze changes ... it opens up a new section . So today , Section 6 was open . Tomorrow , it will be 4 , then 8 , then 3 . The pattern always stays the same . What 's so special about 7 ? I don 't know . But last night , when you killed that Griever ... Section 7 was open . I think it must be where it comes from . Tomorrow , you and I are gonna take a closer look . Hey ! What are you guys doing ? You 're not allowed in here . ( PANTING ) Sorry , it 's just the , uh ... It 's the girl . Is she awake ? You could say that . Chuck , what 's going on ? ( LAUGHING ) Girls are awesome . ( BOYS CLAMORING ) GIRL : Leave me alone ! FRY : Watch your head ! ( BOYS SHOUTING ) Hey , throw one more of those things ... Ow ! Go away ! We come in peace ! What happened ? Just duck ! I don 't think she likes us very much . GIRL : What do you want from me ? We just wanna talk . I 'm warning you ! Take cover , y 'all ! Take cover ! ( ALL SHOUTING ) Hey , it 's Thomas ! It 's Thomas ! I 'm gonna come up , okay ? Okay - Just me . I 'm coming up . ( BOYS CHATTERING ) Whoa , whoa , whoa . Okay , just ... Easy , all right ? Where am I ? What is this place ? Why can 't I remember anything ? This is all normal . Okay ? We 've all been through this . Okay ? Your name will come back to you in a couple of days . It 's the one thing that ... Teresa . What did you say ? My name . It 's Teresa . Teresa , I 'm Thomas . But you already knew that , though , I guess , huh ? They said I kept saying your name in my sleep . Who are you ? I don 't know . ( STAMMERING ) I can 't remember . None of us here can remember anything . We all woke up here just like you did . Hey , I promise ... I 'm gonna take this . Okay . ( SIGHS ) GALLY : What 's going on up there ? Is she coming down ? Um ... Hey , listen , you guys just give us a second , okay ? All right . Come on . Is this what all girls are like ? ZART : That girl is crazy . " She 's the last one . " What does that mean ? I 'm not sure . Ever since you came up , that Box hasn 't gone back down . I just think it 's got everyone a little worried . Especially Gally . He thinks it 's my fault . Are you sure you don 't remember anything else ? I remember water ... feeling like I was drowning . These faces staring at me . And this woman 's voice saying the same thing over and over . " Wicked is good . " Ever since I 've been here , I 've had these dreams . Well , I thought they were dreams . You ... You were there . and you told me that everything was gonna change . What does it mean ? I don 't know . I just always get pieces . And the others don 't remember anything ? No . Why are we different ? These were in my pocket when I came up . " W.C.K.D. " " Wicked is good . " What if we were sent here for a reason ? Alby . ( GROANING SOFTLY ) NEWT : We don 't even know what this stuff is . We don 't know who sent it . Or why it came up here with you . For all we know , this thing could kill him . He 's already dying . Look at him . How could this possibly make it any worse ? ( CONTINUES GROANING ) Come on , it 's worth a try . All right . Do it . Okay - ( GASPS ) You shouldn 't be here ! You shouldn 't be here ! No ! Watch out ! ( GRUNTING ) Get the syringe ! Let go ! ( BOTH PANTING ) Well , that worked . Okay , from now on ... someone stays here and watches him around the clock . Hey - Sundown , Greenie . Time to go . Hey , what is your problem with me ? Everything started going wrong the minute you showed up . First Ben , then Alby ... and now the girl . Everybody saw she recognized you . And I 'm betting you know who she is . ( SIGHS ) Gally ... you know we can 't stay here forever , right ? ( RUSTLING ) Who 's there ? It 's just me . Sorry , Chuck . Here . You 'll run better on a full stomach . Mmm ... Thanks , Chuck . Hey , what do you got there ? Wow , that came out pretty damn good . What 's that for ? It 's for my parents . You remember your parents ? No . I mean , I know I must have them . ( SIGHS ) And wherever they are , I 'm sure they miss me ... but I can 't miss them because I don 't remember them . What do you think you 're gonna find out there tomorrow ? Uh , I don 't know . But if there 's a way out , Chuck , me and Minho are gonna find it . ( SIGHS ) Here . Chuck , why would you give this to me ? I can 't remember them anyway . But maybe if you find a way out , you can give it to them for me . I 'll let you get some sleep . Hey , Chuck . Come here . Put out your hand . I want you to give that to them yourself . We 're gonna get out of here . All of us . Okay ? I promise . Yeah . All right . Good night . Good night , buddy . ( SIGHS ) Big day , Greenie . Are you sure you don 't wanna sit this one out ? Come on , man . Get me out of here . All right . ( DOOR OPENING ) Let 's go ! ( PANTING ) This way . Not much further to the inner ring . Let 's go ! Come on ! This way . ( BOTH PANTING ) MINHO : That 's strange . THOMAS : What ? Seven is not supposed to be open for another week . THOMAS : What the hell is this place ? MINHO : We call them blades . It 's Ben 's , isn 't it ? Yeah . A Griever must have pulled him down here . ( DEVICE POWERING UP ) Whoa , hey ! ( DEVICE CLICKING ) ( DEVICE BEEPING ) I think it 's showing us the way . Wait , wait , wait . What , what ? ( BEEPING RAPIDLY ) This way . Come on . ( BEEPING INTENSIFIES ) Minho , you ever see this place before ? No . ( BEEPING ACCELERATES ) ( EXCLAIMS ) It 's just another dead end . ( DOOR OPENING ) Are you sure about this ? Nope . Grievers . ( BUZZING ) ( BEEPING ) What the hell was that ? ( ALARM BLARING ) We gotta get out of here . Give me the key , give me the key ! ( GASPS ) Move , move ! ( BOTH PANTING ) We gotta go ! Run , Thomas ! We 're gonna get trapped ! Go ! Go ! ( YELLING ) MINHO : Go , go , go ! ( CONTINUES YELLING ) Move ! ( SHOUTS ) ( BOTH PANTING HEAVILY ) Minho ! MINHO : Come on ! Let 's go , let 's go ! ( BOTH YELLING ) Come on , move ! Keep going ! Keep going ! Let 's go ! BOTH : Whoa ! Go , go , go ! ( BOTH PANTING HEAVILY ) Oh ! Go , go , go ! BOTH : Whoa ! Come on ! Don 't look back ! Come on ! ( THOMAS YELLS ) Oh , shit ! There ! Whoa , whoa , whoa ! ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( GROANING ) Oh ! NEWT : What the hell 's going on out there ? What the hell you done now , Thomas ? We found something , a new passage . We think it could be a way out . Really ? It 's true . We opened a door , something I 'd never seen before . I think it must be where the Grievers go during the day . Wait ! Whoa , whoa , whoa ... You 're saying you found the Grievers ' home ? And you want us to go in ? Their way in could be our way out , Chuck . Yeah , or there could be a dozen Grievers on the other side . The truth is , Thomas doesn 't know what he has done , as usual . Yeah , at least I did something , Gally . I mean , what have you done ? Aside from hide behind these walls all the time ? Let me tell you something , Greenie . You 've been here 3 days , all right ? I 've been here 3 years ! Yeah , you 've been here 3 years and you 're still here , Gally ! What does that tell you ? Maybe you should start doing things a little differently . Maybe you should be in charge , what about that ? Hey , it 's Alby ! He 's awake . Has he said anything ? No . Alby ... Alby , are you all right ? Hey , Alby . Alby , we might have just found a way out of the maze . Do you hear me ? We could be getting out of here . We can 't . We can 't leave . They won 't let us . What are you talking about ? I remember . What do you remember ? You . You were always their favorite , Thomas . Always . ( BOYS SHOUTING ) Why did you do this ? Why did you come here ? ( SHOUTING CONTINUES ) ( CRYING ) Winston , what 's going on ? It 's the doors . They aren 't closing . ( BOYS SHOUTING ) ( LOUD CLANG ) ( ALL GROAN ) ( LOUD CLANG ) ( BOYS SHOUTING ) Chuck , go to the Council Hall and start barricading the doors . Mmm-hmm . Winston , you go with him . Got it . Get the others . Tell them to go to the forest . Go hide , now ! Minho , I want you to grab every weapon you can find . I 'll meet you at Council Hall . Let 's go .

( BOYS SCREAMING IN THE DISTANCE ) Stay down ! BOY 1 : Run ! ( GRIEVER GROWLING ) ( BOY 2 SCREAMS ) ( GRIEVER GROWLING ) ( BOY 3 SCREAMS ) ( BOYS SCREAMING IN DISTANCE ) Ahh ! Zart ! ( SCREAMING ) ZART : Help me ! Go ! Get to the village ! Go , go , go ! ( ZART CONTINUES SCREAMING ) ( SHUSHING ) Stay down , stay down ! Gally ! Let me in , let me in ! ( SCREAMS ) THOMAS : Alby ! TERESA : Are you okay ? What 's going on ? They 're here . Grievers ? ( BOY SCREAMING ) Thomas , what do we do ? It 's got me ! ( SCREAMING ) ( GRIEVER SNARLING ) Everybody , run , run , run ! Jeff , come on , go , go , go ! ( ALL SHOUTING ) ( YELLS ) ( SCREECHING ) Everyone , go , go , go ! ( SCREAMS ) Keep moving ! Oh , shit ! Ahh ! JEFF : Alby ! Get behind me ! Come on ! FRY : Over here , let 's go ! Over here ! Let 's go ! Come on ! Over here , come on ! Winston ! Get Alby inside . Chuck , get in ! Go , go , go ! Lock down the doors ! ( GRIEVER GROWLING ) ( POUNDING ON DOOR ) TERESA : Careful . ( GRIEVER SNARLING ) ALL : Whoa ! NEWT : Stay back , guys . ( GRIEVER SCUTTLING ON ROOF ) ( TERESA SHUSHING ) ( ALL SCREAMING ) ( ALL SCREAMING ) ( ALL GROANING ) ( ALL COUGHING ) NEWT : ls everyone all right ? BOY : Help ! Hey , grab him ! Help ! ( ALL EXCLAIMING ) Watch out ! ( GRIEVER GROWLING ) ( ALL SCREAMING ) JEFF : Chuck ! ( SCREAMS ) Chuck , no ! THOMAS : Grab him ! Pull him back ! ( ALL GRUNTING ) CHUCK : Help ! Chuck , don 't let go ! No shit ! TERESA : Pull ! NEWT : Don 't let him go ! ( ALL GRUNTING ) ( YELLING ) ( CONTINUES YELLING ) ( CHUCK COUGHING ) Chuck , are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Thanks , Alby . Alby ! Watch out ! ( GROANS ) ( ALL SHOUTING ) NEWT : Grab him ! ( GRUNTING ) Thomas , get them out . ( SCREAMS ) Alby ! No ! TERESA : Thomas ... Thomas ! CHUCK : Don 't go out there ! MINHO : No , Thomas , wait ! Thomas , wait ! ( GRIEVERS ROARING IN THE DISTANCE ) ( BOYS SCREAMING IN THE DISTANCE ) BOY : Where is everybody ? Who 's that over there ? Gally ... ( GROANS ) ( ALL PROTESTING ) This is all you , Thomas ! Look around ! MINHO : Back off , Gally ! It 's not Thomas ' fault ! GALLY : You heard what Alby said ! He 's one of them ! NEWT : One of who ? He 's one of them , and they sent him here to destroy everything , and now he has ! Look around , Thomas ! Look around ! This is your fault ! MINHO : Back off , Gally ! This is not Thomas ' fault ! NEWT : What are you talking about ? Calm down . GALLY : They sent him here , and now he 's destroyed everything that we 've built ! NEWT : What are you talking about ? ( BOYS ARGUING ) Maybe he 's right . Thomas ... THOMAS : I need to remember , Teresa . Thomas ... Thomas ! No , don 't ! ( GROANING ) Thomas ! Chuck , get the other syringe ! It 's okay . Thomas , I 'm here . THOMAS : Who put us here ? ALBY : That we don 't know . THOMAS : Teresa ... why are we doing this ? WOMAN : Excellent , Thomas . Come with me . Wicked isn 't good . WOMAN : Thomas ... Wicked is good . THOMAS : How could this be my fault ? BEN : You did this ! I saw you ! THOMAS : I can 't keep watching them die . TERESA : Hey . Are you okay ? What the hell were you thinking ? What happened ? NEWT : Gally has taken control . He said we had a choice . Either join him ... or get banished at sundown with you . ( GROANS ) And the others agreed to that ? Gally has everyone convinced that you 're the reason all this has happened . Well , he 's been right so far . What are you talking about ? This place ... it 's not what we thought it was . It 's not a prison , it 's a test . It all started when we were kids . They would give us these challenges . They were experimenting on us . And then people started disappearing . Every month , one after the other , like clockwork . They were sending them up into the maze . Yeah , but not all of us . What do you mean ? Guys , I 'm one of them . The people who put you here , I worked with them . I watched you guys for years . The entire time you have been here ... I was on the other side of it . So were you . What ? Teresa , we did this to them . No . That can 't be true . THOMAS : It is . I saw it . Why would they send us up if we were with them ? It doesn 't matter . NEWT : He 's right . It doesn 't matter . Any of it . Because the people we were before the maze don 't even exist anymore . These Creators took care of that . But what does matter is who we are now , and what we do ... right now . You went into the maze and you found a way out . Yeah , but if I hadn 't , Alby would still be alive . Maybe . But I know that if he were here , he would be telling you the exact same thing . Pick your ass up and finish what you started . Because if we do nothing ... then that means Alby died for nothing , and I can 't have that . Okay - Okay , but we gotta get through Gally first . This is such a waste . Gally ... It doesn 't feel right , man . JEFF : Yeah , what if Thomas is right ? Maybe he can lead us home . We are home . Okay ? I don 't wanna have to cross any more names off that wall . You really think banishing us is gonna solve anything ? No . But this isn 't a banishing . It 's an offering . What ? Wait ! Gally , what are you doing ? You really think I 'm gonna let Thomas back into the maze after what he has done ? Look around you ! Look at our Glade ! This is the only way . And when the Grievers get what they came here for ... everything goes back to the way it was . Are you listening to this ? Why are you all just standing there ? He 's crazy ! You shut up . If you stay here , the Grievers are going to come back . They 're gonna come back , and they 're gonna keep coming back ... until you 're all dead ! Shut up ! Tie him up ! Do you hear me ? I said tie him up ! ( ALL GRUNTING ) You 're full of surprises , aren 't you ? You don 't have to come with us , but we are leaving . Anyone else who wants to come , now is your last chance . Don 't listen to him , he 's just trying to scare you . No , I 'm not trying to scare you . You 're already scared . I 'm scared . But I 'd rather risk my life out there than spending the rest of it in here . We don 't belong here . This place isn 't our home . We were put here . We were trapped here . At least , out there we have a choice . We can make it out of here . I know that . I 'm sorry . THOMAS : Gally , it 's over . Just come with us . Good luck against the Grievers . THOMAS : Everybody , this way ! Keep it up , guys , we 're almost there ! ( GROWLING ) Is it a Griever ? Yeah . Shit . You take this , Chuck . Stay behind us . It 's okay . Just stick with me . Once we 're through , it will activate and the door will open . We stay close , we stick together ... we get through this . We get out now ... or we die trying . Ready ? All right . Let 's go ! ( ALL YELLING ) ( ROARING ) ( ALL YELLING ) MINHO : Get up , look out ! Push it ! Look out ! ( SCREAMING ) ( ROARS ) ( ALL GASP ) The key ! Chuck ! Watch the edge ! ( GRUNTING ) ( SNARLING ) Oh , no . I got you , Chuck ! Pull me up ! ( ALL YELLING ) ( ALL CHEERING ) TERESA : Come on ! Thomas ! Thomas ! Chuck ? We got more coming ! Keep it steady , guys ! ( KEY BEEPING ) It works ! ( BOY SCREAMING ) Teresa , go ! THOMAS : Don 't back down ! Keep pushing ! NEWT : Stay together ! ( TERESA GRUNTS IN FRUSTRATION ) There 's gotta be a way out ! Come on ! ( YELLS ) THOMAS : Watch it ! ( SCREAMING ) ( ROARING ) TERESA : It won 't open ! Thomas ! There 's a code ! Eight numbers ! Eight sections of the maze . Hey , Minho ! What 's the sequence ? What ? The sections of the maze , what 's the sequence ? Seven ! One ! Five ! Two ! Six ! Four ! Heads up ! ( ROARING ) ( SCREAMS ) NEWT : Minho ! THOMAS : Minho ! Oh ! ( GRUNTING ) Get off of me ! ( YELLS ) ( GRUNTING ) ( SCREAMING ) Jeff ! ( CONTINUES SCREAMING ) What 's the sequence ? Come on ! Six ! Four ! Eight ! Three ! You got it ? THOMAS : Keep holding ! Almost there , come on ! BOY : The door opened ! ( BOTH SCREECHING ) ( BOYS SCREAMING ) ( GRUNTS ) BOYS : Oh ! ( ALL SIGHING IN RELIEF ) ( ALL SCREAMING ) Seriously ? WINSTON : What happened here ? So they were watching us . This whole time . Hello . My name is Doctor Ava Paige . I 'm Director of Operations of the World Catastrophe Killzone Department . If you 're watching this , that means you have successfully completed the Maze Trials . I wish I could be there in person to congratulate you ... but circumstances seem to have prevented it . I 'm sure by now , you must all be very confused ... angry ... frightened . I can only assure you , that everything that 's happened to you ... everything we 've done to you ... it was all done for a reason . You won 't remember ... but the Sun has scorched our world . Billions of lives lost to fire ... famine ... suffering on a global scale . The fallout was unimaginable . What came after was worse . We called it the Flare . A deadly virus that attacks the brain . It is violent ... unpredictable ... incurable . Or so we thought . In time , a new generation emerged that could survive the virus . Suddenly , there was a reason to hope for a cure . But finding it would not be easy . The young would have to be tested , even sacrificed ... inside harsh environments ... where their brain activity could be studied . All in an effort to understand . what makes them different ... what makes you different . You may not realize it ... but you 're very important . Unfortunately , your trials have only just begun . As you will no doubt soon discover , not everyone agrees with our methods . Progress is slow , people are scared . It may be too late for us ... for me ... but not for you . The outside world awaits . Remember ... Wicked is good . ( GUNSHOT ) ( DOOR OPENING ) Is it over ? She said we were important . What are we supposed to do now ? I don 't know . Let 's get out of here . GALLY : No . Gally ? Don 't . He 's been stung . ( SNIFFLES ) We can 't leave . We did . Gally , we 're out . We 're free . Free ? You think we 're free out there ? No . No , there 's no escape from this place . Gally , listen to me . You 're not thinking straight . You 're not . Now , we can help you . Just put down the gun . I belong to the maze . THOMAS : Just put down the gun . We all do . ( GALLY WHEEZING ) ( KEY CLATTERING ) ( GASPS ) Thomas ... Chuck . ( GROANING ) Oh , shit . Shit . Look at me , look at me ! Oh , shit ! ( WHIMPERING ) THOMAS : Chuck , look at me , all right ? I got you , buddy . Just hang on . It 's okay . Thomas , Thomas ... No , Chuck . You 're gonna give it to them yourself . Remember , I told you that . Take it . THOMAS : No . Thank you . Thank you . No , Chuck , you 're gonna get ... ( GROANS SOFTLY ) ( EXHALES ) Chuck . Chuck ? Hey . Hey , Chuck , come on ! Come on , wake up ! ( SOBBING ) THOMAS : Damn it ! ( SOBBING ) We made it . Come on . I 'm sorry ! God damn it ! ( DOORS OPENING ) Damn it ! ( THOMAS CONTINUES SOBBING ) Thomas . THOMAS : Chuck ! Get up , Chuck ! Come on ! ( HOODED MEN SHOUTING ) THOMAS : Chuck ! You can 't just leave him there ! You guys all right ? Don 't worry . You 're safe now . Relax , kid . Everything is gonna change . I think it 's safe to say the Maze Trials were a complete success . I wasn 't expecting so many survivors , but ... the more the merrier . Thomas continues to surprise and impress . And for now , they seem to have taken the bait . It 's too soon to say ... but they could be the key to everything . So let 's move forward . It 's time now to begin Phase Two .

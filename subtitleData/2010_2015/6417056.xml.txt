 THE 4 SOLDIERS War started again when just a few rich people remained and the rest were poor . The army backed the rich . Having lost everything , the poor formed militias . I lived with my parents when the fighting began . They were killed early on trying to protect me . I stayed alone at home , in my room , with them ... All alone , for several days ... before joining a battalion . We fought a lot , won and lost , without knowing what for . Come on ! Get a move on ! We 'll miss the fucking party ! Move it ! Get going ! War had become routine . It didn 't seem like it would ever change . Until ... Until I met Matt . We 'll take that house . Check this out . He 's well fucked . Matt was everything I 'm not . And at that precise moment , I wondered if that was why I had followed him . Hey . You coming ? I still wonder , now . It 's cool , you 'll see . It 's not difficult . The house alone must ... Hello . Hey , hello ! Nice place you found . That smells good ... - That looks good ... - Hey ! Soup 's on ! Got any smoke ? Fuck ! Take this . - What 's your name ? - Big Max . " Big Max " ... Not like the burgers . As in Maxim , except Big Max is better than Maxim . Because Maxim 's a bit ... A bit what ? A bit gay . Good night . Good night . The room wasn 't at all like mine at home and yet , I felt like I was back there . Bad memories started to come out of the darkness , multiply . Luckily , there was another bedroom . Night , guys . Forcing me to sleep here , Max made me revisit my parents ' death once and for all and picture them again before the war , alive and happy . Not eating ? D 'you fancy staying with us ? The fear was back suddenly . But different this time . For the first time since ... For the first time , I was scared not just for myself . In midwinter , we started to lose more often . We had to retreat to the country . The battalion 's morale was very low . But we kept ours up : easier for a 3-man team . What 's this about ? Hi , everybody . Headquarters has decided that it 's time to do some recruitment . Our orders are to stick around . That 's all . Your unit commanders will keep you updated . See you later . Don 't get slack , eh ! Idiot ! Do we look like we 're slacking ? It 'd be so cool if we stayed here . Yeah ? Definitely . With all the stuff here , we could build a proper hut . What 's up ? Build a hut with a truck as the lounge ... Eh ? And the kitchen could be a car ... And then , we 'll make a bedroom out of ... out of ... What car for the bedroom ? Eh , Big Max ? The bedroom ... OK , everyone ! We 'll set up camp here ! Where 's that lazy , fat bastard ? We won 't finish before dark , just the 2 of us . We need help or we 're up shit creek . Yeah ? Yes . They 've all formed their own gangs . The guy with the dreads ? Kevin , yeah ? D 'you know him ? Yes . He 's a really good shot . I 've never heard of him annoying anyone . - No news of Max ? - No . Look . It ain 't a car , but we could use it as a bedroom . Yep . Not bad , Maxy boy . D 'you think there 's enough room for him too ? For 2 like him . When the hut was finished , all we thought about was Kevin . But we weren 't worried . At all . There needed to be 4 of us . And he was the fourth . Hello , my love . Happy birthday . I 've a little present for you . Not bad , eh ? - D 'you want it ? - I do . Me too . I 'm keeping it . - Fuck ... - I found it . When all 4 of us went to bed that night , I thought : " That 's it . I 'm no longer alone . " I told myself ... Or rather , I told my parents : " Don 't worry about me . " I 've got friends now . " Winter was long and cold , but our hut held up . And so did we . We were together all the time . Not once did we get on each other 's nerves . Not once did we get bored . Wouldn 't it be better to keep the fuel for something else ? What 's up ? There 's a smell . Of what ? Water . The pool was like a gift to us from the war . We accepted it without feeling bad . We were due it . I 'd never felt time fly like it did that day . So , I thanked the pool for appearing before us . This is no good . That pool 's ours . No one must find it . We 've left a massive trail . Let 's split up . OK ? Max , you go that way . Dominique there , Kevin there . I 'll go this way . Whose turn is it ? Mine . - It 's mine , eh ? - Wait . Let Kevin have it . - Want it , Kevin ? - No . - He don 't want it . My turn . - Why don 't you want it ? Got a problem with girls ? Eh , Kev boy ? Maybe he doesn 't like girls . Maybe he hasn 't yet ... Good night . Night , guys . You like it , eh , big man ? Not like Kev . Come with me . Where 're you going ? Go back to sleep . I had a dream ... What kind of dream ? About Kevin . I dreamt he cut my throat . Cut your throat ? - What ... - He cut my throat with a knife . It 's pretty simple . Want me to draw it ? He cut my throat . Where did it happen ? In the hut . He did it twice . From behind . Kevin isn 't ... He couldn 't do that . Well he did , in my dream . If he 'd stayed longer , I 'd have known what to say . But then , maybe not . OK , my little friends ! Requisition day . It 's your turn . Hurry up if you want any lunch . Get your pants on . Hurry up . I 'll wait outside . Move it ! OK , OK ... Hey , Big Max . Wake up . He 'd been afraid last night . But it didn 't show . Maybe it was better that way , that the others didn 't know . In some ways , I was proud to be the only one who knew . - What is it ? - Nothing . Yes , yes , fat lump ! That 's right ... That 's it ... Yes , yes ! Eh , Big Max ? Hey ! This way , fat lump . I 'm here ! Keep going , you big cuddly lump ! Eh , fatso ! Where are you ? Dominique ! Over here ! You OK ? I 'll just give you the feeling of swimming . It 's safe . - OK ? - Yes . - You alive ? - Eh ? Great , eh ? - OK , another go . - No , no ... Move your arms . All by itself , the pool naturally became like another big room added on to our cabin . The main room , in fact , where the war no longer existed and where we could go to admire our growing bond . Matt ... we 'll say it 's my turn , OK ? - OK ? - You want this ? Have fun . Hello , my love . Happy birthday . I 've a little present for you . She 'd stop if she saw what you 're doing , Big Max . I 'll swap it for a joint . Two . One . OK . Hey , Max , don 't you owe me a joint ? Thanks . Whose turn will it be tomorrow ? Mine again , if Kevin doesn 't want it . Shite ... We did well to wash them . Yes , we 'd done well . In everything . Making a family , especially . Here . That just cost me a joint . Thanks . I felt relieved for a moment . I was his friend , and a useful one , too . A friend he can still wake up at night . And then , all of a sudden , I had this thought : " What if I took Kevin 's place in his dream ? " Up you get , my little friends ! Up you get . We did our fatigue ! No , no ... Get up . It 's not for that , it 's something else . - What ? - Teamwork . Special assignment for you , my friends . Take him with you . Show him the ropes . Gabriel ... Tardif , right ? Gabriel Tardif . No . Find him another group . Take him back to his mum , where he should be . - I don 't want your opinion . It 's an order . You 'll be glad to have him on your side when things start kicking off again . And it 'll happen sooner than you think . - You show him ... - We 'll show him nothing . We don 't want him . There 's no room . We 're breaking camp soon : show him the ropes quickly . Hey ! Go and get the breakfast . Do we show him the pool ? If we 're off soon , we won 't be going back there . We went to the pool , the idea being to lose Gabriel on the way . He didn 't know the camp , and we were sure he 'd stop somewhere . It nearly worked . After , we took him way away from the pool . Get the dice out . Want to lose , fatso ? You 'll get thrashed . I 'll win your joint back , Kev . Where 's the boy gone ? Wait , I haven 't started yet . He 's writing . What ? Hey ! Write this down : " Big Max is nothing but a fat lump ! " No . Don 't write that ! Write : " He wasted Matt at dice . " And then ... Yes ... It 's my turn . No . I 'm playing until I beat him ! - Write : " Big Max is a cheat ! " - No ! Don 't ! What 'll I get ? What am I gonna get ? ! - Eh ? - Whack him in the ribs . Yes ! You can write it now : I am a cheat , it 's true ! Your turn . Rubbish ... Your turn . Did you write what I told you to ? I 'm talking to you ! Did you write what I told you to ? Rather than write about Max being a cheat , I wished that Gabriel had written about the rain on the pool . Hello , Steve . D 'you read me , over ? Even if it meant me getting soaked . D 'you read me , over ? Write that Fatso 's making a racket , too . Eh ? You talking about me , guys ? No . Cut the bullshit . What did you say about me ? Watch the road while you 're driving . Copy that . 10-4 . Hello , Steve . D 'you read me ? Rock Band calling Big Max . D 'you read me ? I prayed to my parents to help , on the way back . To help Matt solve the problem of Gabriel and the pool . I prayed to them like never before . After the pool , Gabriel moved into our room without any problem . But it was too soon for the iPod . Matt ... What ? Nothing . It 's stupid . I 'd be glad to hear something stupid . Go on . It 's too stupid . Even better . Is it still Kevin , in your dream ... Cutting ... Yes . What if it were me ... instead of Kevin ? In your dream , I mean ... What would you and I do after ? After what we 'd been through , I wish he 'd shouted at me for daring to think about taking Kevin 's place . But ... I don 't know . I don 't know what we 'd do . For the first time since we 'd been together , I woke up alone . I couldn 't help myself , I started thinking : " Something serious has happened . " But it was calm . Nothing unusual going on . But I was sure that something serious had happened , or would happen . Are we going ? You 'll love it , boy . - He don 't care , Max . - He 'll write to his ma about it ! Come on , Kev . You can do it . I 'm sure you can ! OK . Alright , alright ... OK ! - Ready ? - Yes . OK , go ! I knew it , lad ! Eyes blindfolded as well ! It 's nice . Nice ? ! Eh , Dom , it 's nice ? ! Did you see him do that ? Eyes blindfolded as well ! Make the most of it . We 're leaving ... Tomorrow night . News of the departure hit us hard . We walked aimlessly for hours . We all thought about the pool , but no one wanted to see it as sad as us . Do you write to your mum ? Who d 'you write to ? No one . You didn 't hit a single bird . We were unlucky . - Happy ? - Yep . You look like a cowboy . I told you . Who 's the Indian ? Your go , Kevin . - No . A bit more . - Everyone gets a go . Stop , horse . You want to ride ? Yes . - Am I leading him well , Matt ? - Just fine , Big Max . - He likes you . - He 's right beside me . Kevin 's smile , the horse walking happily behind Max , Matt and Gabriel walking side by side ... Everyone had his place . My friend . It was as if the horse was taking us away from war . For ever . OK . Change . - Right . Dominique , your turn . - Yep . Here , I 'll help you . - OK , lift her . - 1 , 2 , 3 , go ! No ! No ! No ! I don 't think you 'll get your turn . Nobody 's fault . The short time we had the horse had made us forget the war . We returned to the pool without feeling bad . Pigs are hard to slaughter . Even harder to bear . - " To bear " ? - To put up with ... Especially when they play dice . I bet fish like this . Oh ! I reckon you have to be writing to someone . Who is it ? Me . You ... What 're you writing ? He just wrote that I won at dice . Focus on your fish , fatso . What do you write ? About things I see . And what do you see ? Give me an example . I got one , guys ! I got one ! I knew it ! I knew I would ! It was time ... Oh , he 's a beauty ! Come and see this . Yes ... - Yep , not bad , Big Max . - Not bad , for sure . The pool effect wore off once we were back at camp , and all we could think about was our departure next day . I 've eaten pig and fish in the same day , which means I 've got ... a pig with fins in my tummy , and it tickles ! It tickles ! We were lucky to have Max . Here . Why don 't I ever get it ? OK . A little kiss before bedtime . What is that ? - Hey . - No . - Give me it . - Wait . Give me it ! You 'll get your go . What did you write today ? That you shot at birds , but didn 't hit a single one . True . Did you mention we stole a horse ? Yes . Good . You mustn 't tell lies . And that it ran off before we all got a go . Yes . Did you write how fast Kevin reassembles his rifle , even blindfolded ? No . You should have . Would you have liked that , Kevin ? Yeah ... I dunno . - You wouldn 't like him to write it ? - Yes . I 'd have liked it . See , he 'd have liked you to write that . So you 'll write it ? OK ? At the end , I wrote that we 'd had a good day . And it was true . Good Lord , it was true . The next day , we got up and went off early , without eating , so eager to have one last peaceful day away from war . Let 's get him out . After 3 : 1 , 2 , 3 , go ! Pull , Max ! What 're you doing ? You got a problem ? Afraid of a dead horse ? Eh ? Is that it ? You 're afraid ? Afraid of a dead horse . Talk ! He 's scared of dead horses ! It 's not hard to say that , I don 't think . Eh ? Scared because you never saw it before . He 's never seen it . He 's never seen it . Neither have you . Have you ? You haven 't ... Neither have I. Do we often see horses ? Eh ? Do we see horses ? They 're always alive . Where do you bury dead fucking horses ? Where ? ! Fuck ! Where ? We don 't know where , Matt ... No one knows . Yet again , I wasn 't able to say anything to help him . I let the pool say it for me . I thought : " Yes . The pool will make him forget tonight . " Never had it been so calm , so beautiful . That 's how Gabriel would describe it . I was sure of that . I looked over to where the horse had died . That would also be in his notebook , whether we liked it or not . We 'll stay here . What do you think ? They can go and eat shit . They can find other suckers to march on a cold night . - Yeah ? - Yes . Tonight and every night . We 're happy here . Eh , Max ? Yeah , that 's true . We should stay here and eat fish instead . Your fish aren 't very big . - The fish will grow . - Yes . Yes , yes , yes ... If there are small ones ... there are big ones . We have corn all around . We 've got all we need here . What do you think ? What do I think ? We have a motorhome if it rains . We have our weapons . We can requisition stuff if we want . We don 't need them . We don 't need anyone . They don 't know we 're here . Not one of them knows we 're here . They 'll have to find us before they shoot us . Guys , I 've got one ! I 've got one ! Come and see this ! Not bad , eh ? ! Not bad , eh ? Let 's cook it before we go back . OK ? Yeah , Max . You do that . Don 't forget to add it to your book . OK ? What 's up ? You think it 's too small ? Yes . It 's too small ... Making a big fire , washing our coats , finding out we 're so different from one other , yet , at the same time , perfect for each other ... Each step I took , I wanted 1 more day for us at the pool . Then , I wanted to hug each of them in turn , we were so scared ... we were so lost ... we were so sad . But I held back so that we weren 't laughed at . Now I regret that I didn 't do it . That makes me sadder still . - Guys , we 're stopping ! - Halt ! OK ! Stop ! Guys ! Guys ! Shit ! Dominique ! We 're here , Max . Hiya ! Hi . Hey , guys ... Gabriel . Let 's make a fire . OK , young fella ? Let it out . Where 's the iPod ? Hello , my love . Happy birthday . I 've a little present for you . Good lad ... Kiss her . Go on , you too . Go on . Take another . Let 's go ! Wake up ! On your feet ! On your feet ! Move your arses ! We move out in 5 minutes ! Come on ! Come on ! - Over there . - Take cover . - I can 't see ' em . - Retreat ! They 're waiting for us to move . Fall back ! - Watch out ! Watch out ! - Where ? Watch out ! He killed him ! He killed him ! You 'll be alright . It 'll all be fine . Max , take the lad and hide behind the trailer . Go ! It 'll be OK , Kevin . It 'll be OK ... It 'll be OK . Close your eyes . Close your eyes , Kevin . Calm down . It 'll be OK . Don 't move ! - They 're behind ! - Not there ! Stop it , Max . Stop , Max ! Shut it , you fat fuck ! I realised Gabriel only pretended to write . At first , I felt angry , that he 'd betrayed us . But when I thought it was so we 'd keep him with us ... I thought he was right to want to stay with us ... that we were worth it . And I told myself I had to write our story before it was forgotten . Now I 've written all I could about us , everything Gabriel should 've . Now , it 's impossible to continue , it 's impossible to know whether another smile like Kevin 's exists . Or know what 's left of Gabriel . Or what Matt and Max are doing today . There is no ending . But I must stop ... because I 'm tired . - Who 's got the iPod ? - It 's here . Come and get it . Subtitles : Eclair Media

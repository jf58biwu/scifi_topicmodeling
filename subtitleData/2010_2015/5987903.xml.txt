 In my flash-forward , I was in my office . It was 10 : 00 on the hour , and I happened to see the date ... April 29 , 2010 . Oh , my God . This is it . We 're here . - How 's it going ? - Struggling with the equation . The equation ? Yeah , you do the math . You do the numbers together , and you 're both part of the equation . What 's your name ? We have a shift down at immigration tonight . - I have something I have to tell you . - Me , too . We 're here now . This is all that matters . I want to be with this baby . - Don 't do anything . - What if I don 't want to walk away ? I 'm gonna be on this plane . I 'm hoping you will be , too . We ran this gait analysis on Simon Campos and on suspect zero . Simon Campos is suspect zero . - Who 's Hellinger ? - It 's our boss . Face down ! On the floor ! Simon campos ... is he here ? No , Janis . I need your help . Mommy ! Sweetie ! It 's okay . Deep breaths . You 're okay . You 're okay . What happened ? I had a bad dream . You did ? It 's okay . Today 's the day . But you know what ? It 's gonna be all right . I 'm right here . Today 's the day daddy 's gonna die . - = Blackout Team = - Saison 1 - Ã‰pisode 21 - = Countdown = - You work with my security detail , so you know what will happen when everyone finds out that the mad scientist was awake when the rest of the world was asleep ... - I 'll be a dead man . - What do you want , Simon ? I want revenge . I want to destroy the people who are responsible for the global blackout . Look , they 're cornered now . We have Hellinger in custody . You , of all people , must know it goes beyond one person . I want to get back at them . - And who are they ? - I don 't know , and they had me install a piece of software into the mainframe to make the accelerator fire on October 6th . We 've been over that system a thousand times , - and we didn 't find anything . - I designed it . I 'll find something other people won 't . Let me bring you to the bureau , Simon . - We can help you . - I can 't do this ... with the FBI . I can 't do this with the CIA contacts . Those people won 't let me anywhere near the mainframe again . Look ... You get me into NLAP , I 'll turn myself in . Why did you start working for these people in the first place ? I was a kid ... Told me I was destined for greatness . I believed them . That was a marathon night , but we did it . We got Hellinger . Yeah , we did it . It 's not the end , though . Got a full morning with the digital forensics guys . No , you don 't . You got a flight to catch . Here . - What the hell is this ? - That , my friend , is 15 covers of " Islands in the stream . " There 's my morning jacket , Feist , the Constantines , - some band from Croatia ... - when the hell did you make this ? Yeah , I don 't get much sleep . You 're alive . In the future you saw , you weren 't . Go to Hawaii . Go be alive . Are you kidding ? It 's d-day . We need all hands on deck . The place is packed with CIA , FBI , NSA . We 're covered . Go . Pick a version you like . Dance with your bride . - What 's up ? - Nothing . Everyone gets cold feet , Dem . It 's not cold feet . Do you love her ? Come on . Do you want to marry her ? Hell , yes . So what 's stopping you ? You know , even with the way everything went down ... Even though I lost her ... Marrying Olivia was the best thing I ever did . Don 't be afraid , especially on a day like this . You 'll stay home from school today with me , sweetie . - Hello ? - Hey . It 's me , Lloyd . Hey , Lloyd . Can I call you back ? No , there 's no need . I was just ... - I wanted to talk about tonight . - You know , I really can 't think about that right now . Is everything okay ? Charlie 's having a really hard time . I 'd really like for us to be together . I 'll call you back , okay ? Sweetie . Where 's Demetri ? He 's taking care of something else . What do we got ? Hellinger invested big in dot-coms in the early ' 90s , then dumped them before the crash . He put those earnings into real estate . - Got out at the height of the market ? - Every transaction . He bought low , sold high . Future-casting . They use the flash-forwards to determine the outcome of a particular event , then put money on a sure thing . So was this the bigger conspiracy you were talking about in Hong Kong ? Because it sounds like Econ 101 . Imagine how you could use this technology to manipulate geopolitics . NSA just finished up with Hellinger . It 's been eight hours , and he just said his first six words ... " I 'm only speaking to Mark Benford . " Finally . We need to talk . Did you cause the global blackout ? We actually have something more pressing that has to do with you . Did you cause the global blackout ? Yes , I caused the blackout . But that really doesn 't matter now . - We can 't change that . - How 'd you do it ? I 've seen today more times than I can remember . And a lot of those days started with me sitting right here with you . May I ? - This ? - Please Thank you . There are so many possibilities ... Different paths this day could take . I have seen ... so many different versions of this moment ... And the next one and the next one . But in every version of the future I saw ... I saw this . In this room , you will lose control . And then you 'll lose everything . You 're going to attack me , Mark . You 're going to attack me because you realize you will never get the answers to your questions . And then ... at the end of it all , you 'll be killed in your office . When 's the next blackout ? I 've seen how this goes , Mark . If you keep me in custody , you will die . I 'm sorry . You drew me a picture , and now you want me to let you go ? I know it seems self-serving , but ... please , you have to believe me . This is your life . Tell me how you did it and how to stop it from happening again . If you 're not interested in saving your own life , I don 't have much to say to you , Agent Benford . That 's all right . You just told me what your next move is . Mind if I take this ? You know we 're kicking civilians out at noon , right ? Yeah , I was just packing up my stuff so I could carry on working at home . I 'm sorry . Can I help you ? That symbol . What is it ? The tachyon constant . A theoretical number that physicists have been trying to crack for centuries , sort of a holy grail thing . It was on these blueprints that Dyson Frost was carrying . It was in the ... formula in my flash-forward . At 10 : 00 tonight , I was supposed to be on the verge of cracking something monumental . That would certainly qualify . I don 't know if this helps , there it is again . Lucas Hellinger drew this . He included that symbol as something his side is gonna do today . I want to beat him to the punch . So what the hell is a tachyon wipe ? Nothing . Doesn 't make any sense . The tachyon 's a particle . You can 't wipe it . You literally can 't even touch it . - Hey . - Hey . Happy flash-forward day . I know you love these . They 're for you . Thanks . I was just thinking about you . Liar . Seriously . Check it out . I haven 't planned out everything for tonight , but I thought maybe we could start with some water polo . We could bob for apples , maybe finish off with some scuba diving . Yeah . Keiko . Are you sure that you 're okay with tonight ? With us ? So the sweet , sexy woman that brings me cupcakes ... worried about a pretend girl who lives half a world away ? Come on . Keiko-san . Attention , travelers . You are not required to give money to solicitors . The airport does not sponsor their activities . Hi . Oh , baby . I knew you 'd come . Oh , my god . So my parents are already at the hotel , and they said that there 's a hot tub in the room . Do you remember when we had a hot tub ? Yeah . You 're ready ? - Can I talk to you for a minute ? - Yeah . Okay . What 's up ? I love you . And , I should have told you this ... a long time ago . In Janis ' vision , she was ... pregnant . For that to come true , it had to happen while she was in Somalia . Okay . I slept with Janis so she could get pregnant . - What ? - I know that was wrong . I just ... The future was happening , you know My life was ending . Another life was beginning . I know it sounds crazy , but ... I thought I was gonna die , and ... It made sense at the time . Everything that I 've been doing , Dem . All the lines that I 've crossed , I did everything for you . I did everything I could . It was because I believed that ... I believed that you were gonna live and that we were gonna spend the rest of our lives together . Obviously , you didn 't . I am so sorry . So sorry . I just thought that our life together was over on March 15th . That 's what I thought . I was wrong . You were right . You believed that we can change the future . But I want to start over . I want to marry you . Please marry me . Please ? I 'm gonna ... I 'm gonna go to Hawaii with my parents , and I don 't want you to come , Dem . And after that ... I don 't know . Don 't worry , Tracy . We made it . This is where we were in our flash-forward . I was in a cave . Jericho brought me here . Honey , don 't worry . Don 't try to talk . She needs a hospital . I 'm not sure I can care for her here . Her pulse is thready . They made me tell them . Tracy , we know what we saw . You 're gonna be fine , all right ? I cross-referenced Hellinger 's financial documents with the word " tachyon " . Tachyon offsite information systems . Their office is in Arcadia . Do you think that 's what Hellinger meant by a tachyon wipe ? They warehouse data . Maybe you can 't wipe a tachyon , but data 's a whole other story . I 'm going in with a team . You sure that 's a good idea ? Going after the bad guys ? Yeah . Think about it . Hellinger helps organize a worldwide blackout . You really believe he 'd be sloppy enough to leave you a clue like this ? Maybe . - People make mistakes . - Forget it . - What ? - You heard me . You 're staying . You stay on Hellinger . I 'll send a special ops unit to check it out . No . You can 't do that . I can . You 're staying . I 'm not letting you walk into a trap . She 's barely moving air . Breathe ! Tracy ! No , stop . Aaron , please , let me work . Please . You . What the hell did you and your Jericho buddies do to her ? You 're gonna tell me why Jericho came after my daughter . I 'm just an independant contractor on a ... She saw you guys , killing an entire village . I don 't know what you 're talking about . You 're gonna tell me why , now . We weren 't killing them . She saw ... an entire village full of people passed out on the ground . It was an experiment , a test run . For what ? Keep talking ! The experiment 's radius was 1 kilometer . We needed to know why she was awake . Experiment for what ? - For what ? - For the global blackout . I hope the CIA gives you an expense account . We have to stop by a hardware store , get some supplies on the way to NLAP . Breaking into a linear accelerator , we 're gonna need more than duct tape . Not that kind of hardware . What 's going on here ? What is he doing here ? Tell him to put down his weapon . What 's he doing here ? He 's making a deal . You 're bringing him to NLAP ? You 're planning to let him touch that accelerator ? He can give us more information than anyone else can . In the meantime , you risk him using that machine to put the world to sleep again . I didn 't use it the first time . I 'm not gonna use it this time , either . This is about nailing the people behind the blackout . This is about getting the job done the best way I know how . Come on . You got more to worry about than just doing a good job . Okay . I just need you ... to pretend like you never came by . Just let me do this . You 're gonna regret this decision for the rest of your life . We 've secured the tachyon data center . All we 've got is a room full of servers . Has the data been wiped ? No . It 's weird . I 'm getting nothing ... just a blinking cursor . What the hell was that ? I don 't know . It sounded like it was coming from a storeroom . - I thought you swept the place . - We did . I 'm gonna go check it out . We 're getting thermal readings back now . Get out . Get out of there , Agent ! Heads up ! Movement on your ... Watch out ... 9 : 00 ! Get out of there ! Mark , wait . What 's going on ? They opened fire on three of our guys . You were right . Tachyon was a trap . - Cool down . - No , I gotta go talk to him ! Cool down . Don 't worry . I got this . I got this . Daddy ! Hey , sweetie . You okay ? Are you ? It 's been a slow day . Babe , you want to go wait in daddy 's office ? I 'm really sorry just bringing here like this . She 's scared . I think the reality of today and ... everything that 's happened , I think it 's really hitting her . She just needed her dad . I really did not know what else to do . I 'm glad you brought her over . Hey , Charlie bear . What 's up ? I don 't want you to die . Come here . I need to ask you to do something for me , something really , really hard . Don 't be afraid . I mean , it 's okay to be afraid . It is . But that 's just what happens at first . After that , you have to tell yourself something ... " my daddy loves me , " and everything will be okay , " no matter what . " " My daddy loves me . " So much . " And everything will be okay , no matter what . " It 's not easy , 'cause things can be scary , bigger than us . But we can fight it . That 's what I do . I tell myself , " Charlie loves me , " and everything will be okay " no matter what . " - You do ? - I do . I tell myself that , it makes me strong . It makes me brave . 'Cause when I say that ... You 're always with me . And when I say it ? I 'm always with you . Always . I love you so much , baby girl . I love you with everything I 've got . Thanks , honey . You go and be with mom , okay ? You go ahead now . - You 're making a big mistake . - Shut up . This guy has been lying to us about everything . He was working for them . He was awake during the blackout . How the hell do you trust this guy ? After all the lying , I think I 've realized that you just get to a point where you can 't do it anymore . - You coming with me ? - To the FBI ? Tell ' em where you found him . Don 't lie for me . This NLAP thing is insane . - You know that , right ? - Yeah . I know that . If I hadn 't have shown up , you 'd have gone through with this ? Get in . No , Dylan . Watch out . I am watching . It 's a figure of speech . I mean , be careful , 'cause somewhere in here is the answer to a very big question . Why did the 8 die ? What ? Why did the 8 die ? That 's not an 8 . That 's infinity . What 's infinity ? Well , infinity means " forever . " But you 're right , it does kind of look like an 8 on its side . All the ones with numbers have to be together . Just please , please leave those there . It all has to be in the right place . What did you say ? It all has to be in the right place . Do the numbers . You do the numbers together , you 're both part of the equation . Go and get your coat . Go now . I hope your agents are all right . In most futures , they survive . When 's the next blackout ? You 're not in a place where you can hear this , and I don 't want to say I told you so , but I gave you a choice , Mark . I asked you a question . When is the next blackout ? I gave you a choice , and you chose the wrong path . I 'm sorry the way this is turning out . I mean it when I say that . But there is nothing you can do . Shut up ! When is it ? You 're going to die , and I take no pleasure in that . I really don 't . I 've had so many conversations with you in this very room . You 're a decent man . This is just all over your head . When is the next blackout ? You work hard . You 're passionate about what you do . But don 't you see ? All of this is just so futile , all of it . All of it ? We caught you . Your faith ... it 's admirable . I mean , that board in your office ... How much time have you spent on that thing ? How much time have you spent looking at it , all on faith ? Deep down , you 've gotta know what that board really is . Tell me . What is that board about ? It 's nothing but a scrapbook of your failures . Tell me when the next blackout is . A freed nazi , a botched mission to Somalia , some monster paintings , dead birds ... - Tell me . - And you keep looking at it . You keep believing , you keep fighting 'cause that 's what you do . You and that board , you 're Mr. Stick-to-it . Don 't you see ? That 's why you 're gonna die , Mark . You just don 't give up . You just ... I swear to God , Mark , I am gonna miss you . Charlie 's gonna miss you , too . You are gonna die , Mark . You 're gonna die , but there is an upside . And this is gonna sound a lot harsher than it really is . Deep down , you know what I mean . You 're going to die . But your daughter 's going to be better off when you 're gone . I 'm not finished ! Let go of me ! Clean yourself up , playboy . Get him out of here . You 're kidding me . You 've been on the brink of losing control all day ... all year . - That crazy son of a bitch ... - Out , now . I don 't care what day it is . Get him out of here . - Get out . - You can 't do this to me ! You 're not gonna do this ! We are gonna have so much fun tonight . I promise . I was looking forward to a picnic . That 's what we 're doing . We gotta get there early and stake out some good seats for the fireworks . There 's gonna be 2 , 000 other people . I wanted to be with you . There 's never been a night like tonight . In four hours , people are literally gonna be deciding whether to make their own futures happen . I want to be witness to that . Why ? ' Cause your future didn 't happen ? Where 'd that come from ? I 've just been thinking a lot about the visions lately , and I 'm ... I 'm worried mine may have already started . You 'll be with me . They won 't . It 's not . Nothing is gonna happen no , to you tonight . I promise . Let 's go . It 's not the drowning . It 's that feeling I had , like I deserved it . I 've been keeping a secret from you . It 's really stupid now , because when I tell you , you 're gonna hate me . Come on . Give me some credit . Keiko . She 's in Los Angeles . What ? I 'm sorry . I should have told you as soon as I found out . I just ... I was afraid you 'd choose her . Tell me where she is . Some people from the hospital ... they went down to this immigration detention center in Lancaster . She 's in jail ? No , it 's just a holding facility . You let her stay in ... in jail ? I should have told you , Bryce . I 'm sorry . Keiko Arahida ? There 's someone here to see you . I need a transfer guard at the main Gate . Her heart has stopped ! I need your help ! Just breathe . Breathe , Tracy . Come on , sweetheart . Come on . This can be right . Tracy , come on back ! Come back to me , sweetheart . " This is just all over your head . " You have no idea . In every version of the future I saw , I saw this . The forces of the universe are maybe pushing us towards the futures we have seen . You are gonna die , Mark . But there is an upside . Deep down , you know what I mean . Your daughter 's gonna be better off when you 're gone . Excuse me . I don 't mean to bother you , but ... in my vision , I had just quit drinking . And I ... and I 'd really like to make that happen right now . See , I saw you , and you ... you look like you can use this . Here . It 's okay . I don 't ... What made you change your mind ? I don 't know . I get why you did it . It worked . We have Hellinger . But , Janis , I was so pissed off at you . Working for the CIA ? Since Quantico , I ... I felt like I lost my best friend . It 's like I didn 't know who the hell you were . And then I 'm driving away . I got Campos in the backseat . I 'm looking in the rearview , and I 'm thinking , going to NLAP ? This is ... It 's so like you . I know you , Janis . I don 't know what you were doing . I don 't know what we 're doing tonight , but I ... I do know you . I told Zoey ... - About the baby . - What ? There just comes a time when you ... You can 't lie anymore , right ? We need to stop now . She 's gonna be okay ! Her brain has been deprived of oxygen too long . I know what I saw ! She 's been through enough . We were here together . Her heart has stopped beating . She 's gone . Let her go . I saw you , Tracy . I like the string , buddy . The Chinese say red string brings luck . The Dutch say leave me alone . Maybe in my vision , we were talking to each other . You ever think about that ? Because that 's not what I remember . I 'm sorry . I meant to call . I 'm at your house . Why haven 't you been answering ? I just needed to get away . When you coming back ? Not for a while . What are you saying ? I just need some space , Lloyd . I need to get away from you and Mark and flash-forwards and all of it . - I need to get away . - No , Olivia , listen to me . Look , certain conditions have to be met if I ... At 10 : 00 PM , - you have to be here with me . - Don 't make this about fate . Don 't make this about freewill , okay ? I have Charlie to think about . So I am not gonna be in that house with you tonight . I 'm sorry . They 're not coming back . Yeah , no , I 'm sure it was you . Cheap suit and the ... The bad breath and the droopy eyes . And I kept saying , " hey , man , why are the eyes so droopy ? " That 's it ? Is that the best you can do ? So you 're one of those guys . - Am I ? - Yeah . You 're fightin ' fate , and it 's so sad , man . 'Cause it 's so obvious , man , you 've already lost . - = Blackout Team = -

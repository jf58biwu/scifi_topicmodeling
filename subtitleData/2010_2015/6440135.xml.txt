 Previously on Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D ... There 's so much I wanna tell you about your father . Bring me my daughter . If you 're gonna move up in HYDRA , you need to make friends . I 'm scared for her . She 's a terrible liar . Yes , my loyalties are with HYDRA . - What is it again ? - Not sure . Coulson put me on it a month ago . Searching for a match . I 've got nothing . This writing was on the Obelisk , and now a piece of art . Getting that painting could mean answers . Hello , Raina . You recently took something from me . Bring me the Obelisk . You have 48 hours . The clock starts now . The world is full of people seeking change . Hoping to become something else . Something better . So , my first reaction when I heard that Pete joined the Navy was , " You 've gotta be kidding me . " I mean , this degenerate in the Navy ? Did they even do a background check ? 'Cause I got two words for you , Tijuana ' 09 . Yeah , H-Bomb knows what I 'm talking about . Any chance you boys got something stronger behind that bar ? Sorry , ma 'am . Just champagne . But in this case , change is a good thing . Mariya , you are a super cool chick . And , Pete , you 'll always be my boy . So everyone raise your glasses to Pete and Mariya , the Leitners ! The Leitners ! What 's happening ? Somebody help ! Please ! Somebody help ! Somebody help us ! Eight went down . Dead . And the others ? Some sick . Everyone else scared , but very much alive . How disappointing . Return immediately to give your report . Personally . Dr. Whitehall will not be pleased to hear that we , again , have failed . Eight dead , six of them Navy . All part of an anti-HYDRA unit . Any idea what was used to carry out the attack ? Nope , but the effects appear similar to those from the Obelisk . Which we must assume is in HYDRA 's possession . Heard back from your Navy contact ? Radio silence . Any chance we could find a way in ? Maybe poke around a bit ? Entire fleet 's closing ranks . These were their men . No one other than the CDC , Navy 's top brass are setting foot in that room . Okay , then , that 's a dead end . What about Agent Simmons ? She 's inside HYDRA . Any chance she has some intel ? Still waiting for her to make contact . Sir ? What is that ? Uh , just sketches . If the Obelisk is back in play , we need to know what this writing means . Any progress on your end ? I put some feelers out to my Rising Tide contacts about the painting we recovered in Miami , and no one has seen anything like it . Keep looking . Something will turn up . What about the writings you 've been giving me ? Why don 't you tell me your source and I 'll follow up ? I 'm afraid that 's classified . Well , you 're the boss man . Maybe you could declassify it ? - I could . I won 't . - Why not ? I already answered the question , Skye . No , you didn 't . You skirted it . There 's a difference . Then it 's a difference I 'm comfortable with , but if you continue questioning my authority , then you and I are gonna have a very different conversation . One you will not be comfortable with . Is that clear ? Yes , sir . You know , keeping her in the dark won 't end well . If this bullet had struck even half an inch lower , we wouldn 't be having this conversation . Guess today 's my lucky day . And Big Rick 's last . Please , gentlemen . Not in here . Only ' cause you asked nicely . I realize this is unexpected . We come to you for discretion , Doc . What the hell is this ? My apologies . This will only take a moment . What did I say about interrupting me at my practice ? These men value their privacy . I 'm in trouble . And here I thought you were bringing me good news . I need the Obelisk back . Temporarily , just until I can make other arrangements . And what about ours ? After all these years , I thought you 'd show more respect . - Please , I beg you . - Don 't beg . It reminds me of what you were when I found you . Hungry , in the streets , with just those fairy tales your grandmother told you . You said you 'd make them come true . You said you 'd bring me my girl . And I did ! You brought me a picture and a promise . I still only have the picture . Who wants it ? Who has made you this afraid , Raina ? Daniel Whitehall . He scares you more than I do ? Please . He 's very powerful . Hmm . He has resources . He 's a butcher ! And what are you ? I 'm a man trying to put my family back together ! You 're losing control again ! You need me . You 're barely holding it together . If you 're not careful ... You 'll lose Skye forever if she sees you like this . It doesn 't matter . I 'll never see her if you never bring her to me . I 'm the only one who can . And I can 't breathe ! It 's the only thing that will make her understand . Understand me . I won 't turn it over , I 'm sorry . Daniel Whitehall will cut me to pieces . Yes . He will . And I suggest you go back to his office and beg to him . Maybe he 's turned soft in his old age . I really wanted to bring you Skye . That 's not her name . Hey , Doc . Can we please finish up here ? And for God 's sakes , man , try to keep it together . What sort of hell cow produces carmine milk ? I don 't know . File just says " Bessie . " You two , come with me . Look these over . Oh , my God . What is it ? That 's Daniel Whitehall . One of HYDRA 's new heads . Good day . I 've brought you here because I need your help . We recently attempted to reverse engineer the effects of an alien artifact , using tissue samples from one of its victims . Unfortunately , the results were less than what we 'd hoped for . There were positives . Many of the deceased were enemies of HYDRA . Some of us are pleased with these small triumphs . Others have loftier aspirations . Passion , even . Our founder , he had his Tesseract . As for me , well , it would be an understatement to say that I 've waited my whole life to get possession of the Obelisk . To harness its power . Dr. Simmons , is it ? Yes . Bakshi tells me you have a passion for these things yourself . In your opinion , where did Dr. Lingenfelter go wrong ? I 'm not entirely sure that she did . That 's one among us . Please , clarify . Well , it 's just , we 're dealing with alien technology . Alien metals interact with biology on a cellular level in a way that 's impossible to replicate without a sample . But if we were to acquire the Obelisk itself , would it then be possible to weaponize its effects ? I would think so , yes . Excellent . I want everyone prepared when we do . He knows your name . Do you have any idea what this means ? We could kill millions of people . Perhaps even billions . Pretty awesome , huh ? Don 't mind me , just standing here . Did Skye just steal that painting from our lab ? Mack certainly has an impressive physique , wouldn 't you say ? Bugger off . No , it 's true . Look at him . He 's quite a lot of a man . Well , obviously , I agree , what with you being my subconscious and everything . What ? I can say that to you . It doesn 't mean anything . It 's just a casual observation , that 's all it is . No , I know that . Yeah . Well , why are you still staring at me ? Because you just admitted that I 'm not real . Oh . Please , I 'm not gonna have this conversation with myself again . Fitz . This is a good thing . You 've got friends now . Real friends . You don 't need me anymore . Yeah , but I miss you . I mean , I still miss her . But she left and moved on . Maybe it 's time you do the same . I was a fat baby . You know this is , like , a religious painting , right ? Yeah , well , when aliens started scribbling on the back of it , it kind of voided God 's warranty , as far as I 'm concerned . I just wish I knew what that scribbling meant . Well , the Director won 't be much help . Do you think I was wrong to press ? No , on the contrary , couldn 't agree more . Reminded me how I used to put the screws to my old lady . It 's not like that . No ? Then why put yourself in Coulson 's crosshairs ? Because Coulson used to be different . He wasn 't always so closed off . I 'm telling you , my ex was the same way . Always keeping secrets . Drove me absolutely mental . There really is only one way to handle people like that . Dig deeper . Invade their privacy till they go crazy themselves . Wow , thanks for the advice , divorced guy . All I 'm saying is there 's something Coulson doesn 't want you to know . Maybe you should find out what it is . And how do you suggest I do that ? Well , I don 't know exactly . But it seems your HYDRA boyfriend downstairs would be a good place to start . Surprised it took you so long . This isn 't about that . Come on , Skye . Don 't pretend you haven 't thought about what I said . Well , I 'm pretty sure you 're the last person I 'd ever wanna talk to about my father . Not if you wanna find him . My parents were killed in the Hunan Province along with everyone else in their village . That 's not what happened . I know what you 're doing . I 'm just trying to help . Nope . You 're exploiting a weakness . Looking for a way in . I told you . I will never lie to you . Not again . Okay , if you 're really being honest , name your source . What ? If you have information about my father , tell me where it came from . It 's that simple . Raina . She knows him , Skye . No , I believe that you think she does . Do you not get it ? Raina played you . She found your weakness , and then used it against you . - Skye ... - Shut up , Ward . I don 't wanna hear you say another word about it . Good . Tell me what you know about this . I first saw that when we were in Belarus . Me and you . And later on when Garrett started etching that in the glass . Garrett carved this stuff himself ? Did he say what it was ? No , but he wasn 't making a lot of sense after he was injected with the GH-formula . These writings , they 're not yours , are they ? Good . That 's good . ' Cause once Garrett started , he couldn 't stop . That writing was anywhere he could carve it . On the walls , on the floor ... On his desk . To be honest , I was almost relieved when S.H.I.E.L.D. put him down . The Garrett I knew was long gone once the writing started . And whatever took his place , I don 't think it was meant to survive . HYDRA pursuing alien WMD technology . Must act quickly to prevent extinction-level event . Awaiting further instructions . Fish tacos . The reason you won 't name your source is because you are the source . By all means , come on in . Please , I know it 's you , so just be honest with me . Are you okay ? I 'm fine . Because once Garrett started writing , he went kind of nuts . I see you 've been talking to Ward . I told you , I 'm fine . May 's been keeping an eye on me . When did you start doing this ? First night I saw Garrett 's writings , it just triggered something in me . What do you think caused it ? The GH-formula , most likely . Garrett and I were both injected . Not a coincidence . Yeah , but so was I , and I haven 't written anything like that . Which is either very good , or a whole different kind of scary . Which is why we had to monitor you . Wait , " Monitor " ? That is a very specific word . We didn 't tell you about this because we wanted to passively observe . See if the writing would trigger something in you . So , what ? You guys put , like , tiny hidden cameras in my bunk ? Not in your bunk , but I think you 're focusing on the wrong details here . I didn 't react the same way . Right . I believe Garrett and I had a negative reaction to the alien DNA in our system . Maybe you didn 't , because it was already there . Yeah , right . Like I 'm an alien . Hold on , are you saying that I am an alien ? It 's a theory . No , a theory is what scientists use to prove things in nature . This is you telling me that I might be an alien ! That is not something you just say like it is no big deal ! I was trying not to rattle you . Guess what ? Epic fail ! Coulson , you have a call on line one . Really not a good time . You 're gonna wanna take this call . Hello ? I hope I 'm not interrupting . Somehow , I suspect that 's the point . What do you want , Raina ? To meet . You and I have something to discuss , Agent Coulson . The matter is quite urgent . Everyone , listen up . I need each of you to step away from your desk and place your hands behind your back . Keep everyone off their phones and tablets . We have a mole , ladies and gentlemen . Right here , in our very facility . Someone has been sending S.H.I.E.L.D. messages right under our noses . I specialize in finding them . Bakshi here ... Well , he makes them suffer . Until that happens , no one leaves . HYDRA does not tolerate traitors . Anyone caught in possession of contraband will be punished accordingly . Dr. Jemma Simmons . This is quite an impressive resume . S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy , top of your class . Two PhD 's in very advanced fields . It even says here you spent time in the field as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent . - Is that correct ? - Only a short time . No , you 've only been at HYDRA a short time . But it seems that you 've been affiliated with S.H.I.E.L.D. in one capacity or another for most of your life . To be fair , aren 't most HYDRA agents ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives ? Who were working from within S.H.I.E.L.D. long before it fell . But there 's no evidence you supported HYDRA while S.H.I.E.L.D. still existed . In fact , it seems you were an exemplary S.H.I.E.L.D. agent . Perhaps even still are . My loyalties are with HYDRA . I 'll be the judge of that . Madam , there 's something you have to see . Wait ! That 's not mine . I 've never seen that before in my life ! I don 't even know what that is . - Still nothing . - Copy that . You ask too much . My food , it suffers from this intrusion ! We have been over this . You and your staff will be well compensated for your help . Incoming at four o 'clock . The tiny girl in the flower dress ? That 's who everyone 's making such a fuss about ? It 's good to see you , Agent Coulson . Raina . I was worried you weren 't going to accept my invitation . Perhaps I wasn 't the only one looking forward to our next meeting . Is she hitting on him ? - Yep . - That 's what she does . You implied there was something urgent to discuss , so here I am . Either way , you 're gonna give me what I want . You 've changed , Agent Coulson . Might just be circumstance , considering last time you had me strapped into your little memory machine . I was only trying to help . You wanna help ? Tell me where to find the Obelisk . I 'm afraid it 's out of my hands . That really doesn 't work for me . I 've seen what that thing can do . It 's too dangerous to be out in the real world . You 've only seen the beginning . Just because something 's powerful doesn 't make it dangerous . In this case , it 's more the death and destruction . You must believe me , Agent Coulson . We want the same thing . Unless it 's an end to this conversation , I 'm pretty sure we don 't . You really know how to make a girl feel special . Only when I suspect she has something up her sleeve . It 's in my purse , actually . Right now , HYDRA 's looking for a spy within their ranks . I wonder what would happen to Agent Simmons if this were to fall into the wrong hands . Everything will be just fine . Don 't you seem nervous . Maybe it has something to do with you lurking right outside of my stall ! Bakshi informed me that you and Kenneth were lab partners . We 'd worked together on a couple of assignments , yes . Well , there are some who believe that he may not have been acting alone . Were you colluding with Kenneth ? No . Did you plant the flex screen on Kenneth 's desk ? No . Not a very good liar , are you ? Maybe I should take a look at your hard drive , see what I find . Go right ahead . It 's nothing but HYDRA files . Oh , it better be . I want you to keep something in mind , Agent Simmons . HYDRA is everywhere . Carry on . I don 't like being threatened . This isn 't a threat . It 's a gesture of goodwill . I would like nothing more than to delete that photo . And in return , what do you want ? From you ? Nothing . But I will need to take Skye with me . Excuse me ? What in the hell is this really about ? And why , also in the hell , do you think I would ever let that happen ? To prevent every HYDRA employee from receiving an automated email with that photo . You have two minutes , after which there 's nothing I can do . Where are you planning to take Skye ? Somewhere she 's always wanted to go . To meet her dad . She 's lying . Ward said Raina knew him . This cannot be a coincidence . So , you 're , what ? Working for Skye 's father now ? I 'm just trying to make the best out of a difficult situation . By threatening the life of one of my agents ? By allowing one to find out who she really is . That 's what Skye 's been searching for her whole life . Ask her yourself , Agent Coulson . She 's here , isn 't she ? Listening . Skye needs to know that her father loves her very much . That she was taken from him against his will . That he 's spent her entire life searching for her . No matter how much you 've changed , Agent Coulson , deep down you 're still a good man . No good man would intentionally keep a daughter from her father . Especially when so much is at stake . You 're running out of time . Give Skye what she 's always wanted , or else Agent Simmons dies . No deal . Stand down , Skye . Were you not listening ? If I don 't go out there , Simmons is gonna die ! Coulson has a plan . He also carves alien writing into his desk . So maybe his judgment is not what it used to be . I said , stand down ! Look , it 's not too late . We can fix this . No one needs to get hurt . Please . There she is . Grab her ! Oh , no . What is happening ? Don 't worry . Coulson has a plan . I can 't believe you would sacrifice one of your own agents . We all take risks in this business . In your case , it just didn 't pay off . I had no choice ! Tiny violin 's playing , but no one 's listening , sweetheart . Who 's making you do this ? HYDRA . They want the Obelisk , but you don 't have it . Skye 's father does . He won 't stop until he gets her . You 're scared of him . And you don 't scare easily . He 's a very dangerous man . You wouldn 't believe the stories . Well , now we 've established Skye 's old man isn 't Father of the Year . What 's next ? Take me in . Please . Sorry . No vacancies . Once I walk out that door , Whitehall will kill me . It 's possible . Or maybe you and I will work together after all . - What ? - Tag and tail it is then . You 're gonna use me to get to Whitehall . He 'll be trying to find you . Whether or not we 're there to save you when he does , that 's your call . Depending on how useful you make yourself . You can start by telling us how to find Skye 's father . I don 't mean to sound ungrateful , because I am truly grateful , but who are you ? Bobbi Morse . Coulson sent me in to infiltrate HYDRA and keep an eye on you . Well , you did a spot-on job . Really , you were quite intimidating . Sorry about that . I had to assess other security issues that were in play . Yeah , like every HYDRA agent receiving an email blowing my cover ? Yeah , that was a curve ball . I 'm afraid there 's no way I 'm walking out that front door . Don 't worry , all we have to do is get to the roof . There 's already an extraction team there waiting . Okay , just wait here . It 's all part of the plan . All right ? We 've been compromised . I need you to abandon your post and follow Protocol 685 . It 's her . - I told you there was a plan ! - I know , I 'm sorry , but ... Okay , go get to the roof . Go . Where are they ? We 're trapped ! Southwest corner ! Repeat ! Southwest corner ! Get down ! Run ! There 's no one there ! Welcome back , Agent Simmons . Trip , it 's so good to see you . You certainly know how to make a first impression , Agent Morse . Please , it 's just Bobbi . Forgive me for asking , but if you were able to infiltrate HYDRA , why even bother having me go in ? My cover gave me access to HYDRA Security , but none of its high-level projects . Then I 'm afraid I came up empty-handed . Not entirely . My hard drive ! I took it after our conversation in the bathroom . Seemed like it might provide some useful intel . Oh . I like you . Cargo 's on board , and we 've cleared HYDRA airspace . Copy that , S.H.I.E.L.D. 218 . - Hey , you . - Hey . Course is set . Proceed back to base . If you ask me , Coulson let you off easy . I didn 't ask . Good luck out there , love . The address Raina gave us is only a few blocks away . And I thought she chose this place for the ambience . Remember what Lumley said about Skye ? " Wherever she goes , death follows . " Yeah , that was a memorable quote . Look , we know Skye 's father 's been searching for her all this time . What if he 's what Lumley is so afraid of ? - Probably a trap , isn 't it ? - Could be . I 'll need you running surveillance . May , check the scanners , make sure local PD aren 't patrolling the area . And , Skye ... Where 's Skye ? Hello ? Anyone here ? You wanted to meet . Well , here I am . Where did you go ? So he was here ? Yeah . I just wanted a glimpse . You 're having one hell of a day , huh ? We 'll find him . It 's okay . So , is this a group hug-type situation ? You find anything ? Place has been cleared out . Must 've left in a hurry . Agent May is checking the back room . Have you been drinking ? I was working . I had to maintain my cover . Your cover as what ? Ron Burgundy ? I can see why she frustrates you . Agent May , any sign of him ? No . But there 's something you need to see . Looks like a small blade . Probably a scalpel . And this is just pure strength . - Whoever did this ... - We all know who did this . Look at what he did . I can 't believe it . No , no , no . - He 's a ... - Monster . This is S.H.I.E.L.D. 218 , asking permission to land . You 're cleared for landing , S.H.I.E.L.D. 218 . Welcome home , Agent Simmons . Director Coulson . I 'm glad to have you back . I 'm just glad to be alive . If it hadn 't have been for Agent Morse , I ... Bobbi . Bobbi , right . If it hadn 't have been for Bobbi , I would never have made it out . Probably be brainwashed , happy to comply to who knows what . She 's amazing . That 's why I 've asked her to join the team . Go ahead . Agents Triplett , Morse . Hi , Fitz . Simmons . Is that really you ? Of course it is . Who else would it be ? How 've you been ? Thank you . Hey . Long time no see , Barbara . Don 't start with that again . Hey ! Aw . What you been up to ? Oh , you know , working undercover at HYDRA , acting all uptight and evil . You know what I could really go for right now ? Three-olive martini . - Hold the olives . Yeah . - Hold the olives . Yeah . Bobbi ? Hey , Hunter . Nice suit . Nice suit ? Really ? That 's what you 're leading with ? What did you do to your hair ? Ever heard of undercover ? I prefer you blonde . Well , I didn 't do it for you . Two seconds in , there 's already a tone . This isn 't a tone . This is my speaking voice when I 'm upset with an unreasonable person ! What 's the deal there ? Hunter ever tell you stories about his she-devil ex-wife ? All the time . Damn . Anyone mind telling me what the bloody hell she 's doing here ? Bobbi 's one of our best agents . Oh , that 's rich . Then mind telling me what I 'm doing here ? That 's easy . I vouched for you . Why the hell would you do that ? Play nice . It 's good to have Simmons back . Which is why you should be down there . - I know you 're gonna go after him . - Skye ... No , it 's okay , I get it . He 's a bad guy . And right now , he has the Obelisk , which is a bad thing . You know , I spent all my life wondering who he was , and why he left . But after today , I just don 't care anymore . All I care about is that we stop him . And I just wanted to let you know that whatever it takes to do that , I 'm in . That 's good to know . But if we 're gonna do this , you have to be completely honest with me from now on . No more secrets , no more compartmentalization , and definitely no more hidden cameras . Whatever 's going on , you bring me in . No exceptions . Okay . We should probably get started . So , this is what you 've been doing up here . Well , it 's what I did yesterday . You 're kidding . I don 't know how else to explain it , but it needs to be carved . Does it just appear in your mind , like some sort of vision ? No . It just kind of happens . Which is really frustrating because no matter how much I carve , it still means nothing to me . I don 't even have a theory . I do . It 's a map . The lab should be dismantled within the hour . And the rest of the facility ? Not long after . I couldn 't help but notice all the moving boxes . I 'm sorry for the interruption . This will only take a second . Remove him ! Please , lower your voice . Let 's all try and keep our heads about us . Let 's all try and stay calm . Sorry . Let 's all try and keep our heads about us . I hear you 've been looking for this . The Obelisk . In its native language , it 's called The Diviner . One of many little details I know about this thing . Can you tell me how to use it ? Better yet , I 'll teach you how to survive it . And why would you do that ? We share a common enemy . Guy named Phil Coulson . I thought maybe , together , you and I could kill him . Along with , you know , everyone else .

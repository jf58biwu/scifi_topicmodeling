I guess I should be happy for that . You would rather be here then ? Be where ? Here then ? Yes , but everything has its price . - I think you already know . - Huh ? Rebecca told me about the camp . You are not your mother . There she casts no shadow over you . - She 's just so damn embarrassing . - Everyone has a Hubot nightmare in the family . - Eve , your leader , was married to one . - Was she ? The worst activist . That was why she was different . Do you have any Hubot nightmares in your family ? My family is my wife Susie and Rebecca . My other so called family I have nothing to do with . [ GUN SHOT ] Neat ! I see you as a part of my family . Hope you do not mind it . No . Good . [ GUN SHOT ] Work on sighting . That 's not good enough . - We did it ! They signed on . - That is so great ! . - You are amazing ! - Thanks , Henning . - Isn 't she ! - Absolutely stunning ... fantastic ! . When they looked at the 7th section and they just ...

It 's not only this . - How did you become who you are ? - What do you mean ? It may sound a bit clumsy ... Was there a code or something else ? Or ... Are you built like this ? No . There is a code ... that makes you like this ... Free ? There was a code , but it 's ruined now . It is no more . Thank you . That was what I needed to know . - He tried to fucking kill me ! - There is no armed Hubot . - Are you calling me a liar ? - No , but you can be caught up in the game . - It may feel like the real thing . - It was a gun . - " No one " has a gun . - Thanks , Odi . Stay out of this . - Forget me paying for this ! - You 'll get the money back . - Here . - You acknowledge that it is highly dangerous then . - Nah . - Nah ? - Why pay you , then ? - You get half back . All ... There 's something wrong with that fucking Hubot ! And he called me " Roger " . - He works here . - Quiet , Odi . You do not need to speak . - You ruined my friend 's wedding . - You will receive discount coupons . With a little imagination you could figure out we don 't want that . I 'll tell everyone what a shit-hole this is . I do not like them . They were not nice . - Need pasta bolognese ? - Nah , I want to see Roger immediately . Tell him to come in , Odi - What 's over there ? - Nothing . The world ends there . We must go on . I do not want to go there . I want to go home . To Roger ? You must not . You think you want it , it 's Roger fooling you . All are fooled by Roger . You 're with me now . You want to be with me . I 'll take care of you . Come , I 'll show you where there is electricity . I heard Hub Sec sirens . It was best for everyone that no one was here . I locked up the code properly . You did not think I had thrown it away ? I made a sad discovery . - It 's empty . - What do you mean ? It 's empty . It was probably a one-time code . Now it 's just in your Hubot . Can you get him out of the Hub Sec ? No . - Identification data was deleted . - It was a useless effort then . Or , well , maybe it was just as well it failed . - Well , what will you do now ? - We 'll go . Go for it ! - Sorry I did not succeed better . - Hum ... I am Jonas Boberg . You do not know me . I have worked on this for so long . But I know your fantastic work and I need your help . - Where is the music ? - What music ? This is a lab , right ? Yeah . And you work here ? So where 's the music ? I need the code which can liberate Hubots . There are no books either . No music , no books . No time to read . No time to live . He who gives life ... Must have a life . Jonas . - What will you use the code for ? - Whatever ! I need it . - You can get a lot of money . - You think money is important ? You can get music , books , whatever you want ! Only if I get the code . - I can not give you that . - Why not ? I do not have it . What do you mean ? I have set it ... free . Sure you have it ! YOU created it . I have given it to the world . It 's there now - out there . - Have you had a good day ? - Typical . Sit down . Are you still angry ? Honestly ? I do not know . On the one hand , I do not really how you could do that . On the other hand ... I had to ... I have to understand that ... My Father is dead , though it is completely incomprehensible . He 's been dead for a year soon . Yet it feels as if he died again . Sorry . Come here . This is not your fault , Tobbe . And we 'll get over it . - It 's okay to cry if you 're sad - I know that . It 's alright . - Want some tea ? - I 'd love some . Wait ! Careful ! I 'll take it . Thank you , Silas . I have found that the battery that you need . Great ! We just can not change it today . Because you 're tired ? You need to sleep ? - Not because of that . - Tomorrow then ? Not even then . But soon . I promise . - Then I can go there myself ! - Yes . - And there . - Of course . And out there ... in the park . You can go anywhere you want , Odi . - So , my mother 's little sweetheart . - Hey , baby ! There were many people in town . It was difficult to get a taxi . Now we are home ! - Hello . - Say hello to your dad . Hi , honey . Everything good ? I 'll put her down . She is a little tired . - Would you like some tea ? - Yes . That 's good . Put them right there . It was paid and clear , so thank you . Honey , you should see what I have bought . So cute rompers ! Wait ! For Bali this summer . And look at this ! - On safari in winter . - Of course . What ? Her birth certificate . It says , " Father Unknown " . Now it 's , " Father : Douglas Jarméus . " - Is it true ? - It 's true , I 'm officially her dad . - Am I Mom ? - You 're mom . I love you ! - God , good . It was crazy expensive . - Do not joke like that . Sorry . I love you . - No one will know that you are a Hubot . - Shhh ... Do not say that . - What you just said . - Hubot ? Yeah . - Do not say " Hubot " ? - We do not use those words . - I do not see myself that way . - Neither do I , but it is just a word . - I do not care about " Hubot " . - Let 's talk about something else . - Wow . Look , over there , there , dear . - Hello ! - Douglas ! Hey . Oh , you 're here ? Oops , then . - And what is this revelation ? - Say hello to your new grandchild . Nah , now ... Now you must explain a bit . Douglas met a woman shortly before we met . It ended before she said she was pregnant , and yes , now the baby is here . - But Douglas , who ... Who is the mother ? - She ... She does not want the child , so we have taken over custody . - Custody ? Now I have a lot to ... - Want to sit down ? - Do you want a glass of water ? - No , but I 'll have whiskey in the cabinet . - Ice or water ? - Clean - and a lot ! - What does Florentine mean about this ? - What she said . When I met that girl I had no idea about this . Should she take care of another woman 's child ? I 'm trying to understand . - Do not underestimate Florentine . - Do not underestimate what ? - I said a lot , but you heard when I ... - There 's more . A larger glass ? Thanks , it 's so good . But ... So you do not mind this arrangement ? Huh ? - Florentine ? - Sorry ? Are you talking to me ? No , how could I ? I love Douglas . And I love children . We thought about calling her Marianne . Momma ... Can I ? Hello . I know how to hold a baby . Albert was once this small . - Hello . Marianne , This is your grandfather . Not him , but me . Yes , so nice . Oh , she smells good . David does not have the code . - Say something ! - Remove the handcuffs . Why doesn 't David have the Code ? - What did David say exactly ? - That he had set the code free . What does this mean ? He sent the code along with the freed Hubots . - Like you ? - Niska and Leo each got half the code . Niska had no code . Yea . Not your mom , but a Hubot he made in her likeness . Where is it ? It burned up . - And Leo ? - He 's dead . - And the code is not there ? - Let me talk to him . If David knows some way to get the code he will tell it to me . Why would he do that ? Because he 's my husband and he loves me . He 'll do anything for me . Beatrice . Jonas , why is she restrained ? My beloved Beatrice . Do not trust them . They want to destroy us . They activated my immobilizer . - Can you use the MSU Code ? - I do not have it . Memorize this : 12 TPU ... So I want you to flee as soon as you can . - How ? - My little warrior ... Enough . You have something to say to him , right ? This is very important ... Jonas wants to get the code . Do you have it ? - Sorry . - He does not . Take her away . Wait ! I can re-create the code . Yeah ? But not if I have to worry about my wife . If you give me the code , I guarantee that Beatrice will be treated well . - Do we agree ? - Yes . You too . Front ! Turn around . - I was just thinking ... - Go ! - What are you doing ? - Go away ! Sorry . Hello ? Hello , anyone there ? I can hear you breathe . Roger ... ? Roger , Is that you ? You have to help me . Why should I ? Please , Roger . Help me . They keep me captive . They make me sick . I do not believe a word of what you say . Sorry . Sorry . I still have feelings for you . I love you . Roger ? Roger ! Roger , are you still there ? Fuck ! [ BABY CRYING ] Marianne ... Can 't you sleep ? She 'll fall asleep soon . Never mind . - Now you do not have to be afraid of him . - What do you mean ? You 're free now . The evil man will hurt you no more . I shut him off . We will go now . Gordon , let go of me ! Douglas ! Douglas . Douglas ! Douglas , wake up ! Douglas ! Do you still have the device that tests for the HSE Trojan ? - Ummm ... Now ? - Now . Yea ... It will surely still be here . Douglas ! Douglas , wake up ! Wake up now ! Wake up ! - We have to go away from here . - Leave me alone ! You are free ! You 're not his slave anymore , Flash ! I 'm not Flash ! - I want you to go now . - Not without you . I 'll call an ambulance . For what ? My husband needs help . You can not be here when they come . They will dispose of the both of us . Therefore , we must disappear . Not us . You ! This is urgent . I need an ambulance . You are my sister . Now it 's just you and me . - Maybe it 's best if Inger did this . - No ! I do not want you to say anything to her . Not to anyone . - We have tested you . - I was careless . I did a download I should not have done . - Why did you do it ? - I do not know . It was probably nothing . We 'll run this test now . Now we 'll see ... That one . And then . This goes really fast . What does it say ? [ BEEPING ] Hans !

 Three , two , one . Get it ! Come on ! Come on , here we go ! Yes , come on ! Congratulations ! Oh , my gosh ! All right ! Congratulations , ma 'am . You are going to San Francisco ! Hello ? Who ? It 's Grace Kaukonen for you ? Who ? She sounds British . Hello ? Yeah , I see . Yeah , no problem . I 'll ... Yeah , I 'll be right there . You gotta go now ? It 's 9.30 . That 's what 24 hours means , honey . Waste pipe broke . They got sewage spilling into the rec room . Running toward the ball , he grabs , reaching out ... he makes a backhanded catch and then slams against the fencing ... spinning away from the wall in the end after a fabulous catch ... retiring fades and ending the night for the poor Sox . No ! - No ! - Danny ? Leanne ! - Panj familii . - Anton ? Janus . You 're all going to die . I want to help you , and I believe this is right . It 's just I ... I don 't think I can . Do you think I wanted to be Mr. Rabbit ? Well , I 'm alive . I have Christian Donaldson . But I want Amanda and Tess safe . - Jessica 's gone . - What ? Philip ? Philip Carvel ? - Philip Carvel 's alive . - Philip 's alive ? We need to talk . To test a nuclear device on the Kazakh border . Now China is claiming that this was previously a nuclear testing site .. But there is little doubt that this is Beijing drawing a line in the sand . - We await a response ... - You want to speak to me ? You have something to tell ... Fucking ... fuck ! How long have I been asleep ? Two days , straight through . Can I have some food , please ? Remember this ? - Philip ? - Jesus , don 't call him Philip . Why not ? Pietre and Donaldson are out and Grant 's in his own world . We 've been here for two days . Why the hell are we doing nothing ? - And what is it you wanna do ? - Look . He saw a news story and said , " Janus , you 're all gonna die . " It was USNC News , an American network , which means we can 't get it online . - So we need to break into their offices . - What ? We need to steal it and show it to Anton , then we go and talk to Dugdale . Break in ? What are you on ? And fucking Dugdale 's with them . - I don 't believe he is . - And your judgment 's so great . What does that mean ? No , no , come on . Let 's have it out . - You called Milner . - Oh , here we go . After everyone saying , " Don 't call Milner , don 't call Milner , " you called Milner . - It was a mistake . - Was it ? Was it , Ian ? Are you that fucking stupid ? Or ... are you actually quite fucking smart ? Your insults are getting increasingly cryptic . What the hell are you saying ? Maybe you 're doing stupid stuff cos you want it more dangerous . Oh , for Christ 's sake , Becky ! - You 're getting off on it . - This is fucking psychobabble . It 's not IT any more , is it , Ian ? Getting a buzz , are you ? Nice little danger bone . Gonna nip off for a little five-finger froufrou ? And you 're obsessed with wanking . Well , let 's face it , you 're not into me any more , are you ? No . No , I am not . Right . Can I ask why ? Ask your pal . Donaldson . Fuck 's sake ! Why 's Anton drawing on my Utopia ? It 's time you knew something . But you can 't tell anyone this , Grant , all right ? Anton is Philip Carvel . Nah . What , Anton ? Mad Anton ? Do you remember anything else about that story ? Are you sure it wasn 't ... it wasn 't about the vaccine or V Day ? Nah , it was just about a cat on a fucking Hoover . Anton went nuts . Right , I 'm going . Fuck this . I can 't just sit here . China is the largest consumer of wheat in the world . Its harvest is fading . It 's not just gonna roll over . Yes , but it cannot be allowed to flaunt international law . America 's right . It should be closed now it 's a peak market ... These are nice . - Did you use salt ? - Er ... yeah , but just a pinch . It 's nice . Tasty . Do you do that while you 're cooking them , or after ? Er ... after . Otherwise you ... you lose flavour . Actually ... do you mind if we talk about you breaking in with a knife ... and not my eggs ? So you 're in charge of the vaccine , Michael ? Look , look , I ... I know how this looks . But I thought all ... all this , er ... Janus stuff was over . And Geoff said we had to keep making the vaccine . You know , all the fuss last year . He couldn 't just stop ... Well , he ... well , he paid me ! Money ! Jessica , I am not with them . Michael , don 't worry . If I thought you were with them , you 'd be dead . I know who Mr. Rabbit is . - Mr. Rabbit 's dead . Grant killed him . - Mr. Rabbit 's alive . I won 't tell you who . I 've put you in enough danger , and you 've been really kind to me . I 'm sorry your wife left you . And you must miss Alice . Look , I 'll stay a day or two . I 'm trying to find Ian . Well , there was something between him and me , you know ? Oh , right . Because I thought , er ... Becky ... Yeah . I like Becky . She 's not for him , though . Can I ask what we 're doing here ? Excuse me . Why ... why am I here ? Oh , nice . Live feed . Where is that ? Greece ? Albania ? - Am I getting a new identity too ? - Yeah . Albania , I reckon . No CCTV . Cash-based culture . Yeah . Albania 's where I 'd go if I was retiring . So , erm ... what the fuck 's going on ? Arby 's saving his family . - Oh , I ... I didn 't see you as a family man . - This is all about family . Oh , here we go . See ? Tess and Amanda are safe . - Hello ? - Tess ? It 's me , Pietre . Pietre , what 's going on ? - These men , they ... they just took us . - Tess , please , you have to listen . I need you both to look up to your right and into the camera , now . Amanda , look over here , please . That is the last time you can ever do that . In the bag , there are new identities . - But what ... I ... - You can never go home . You can never use bank accounts or e-mail . You can never contact anyone you once knew . Go east . After half a mile is a blue Toyota . Drive to the location on the map , and start a new life . Are ... are you coming too ? - No . You will never see me again . - But ... Why ? Can you both look into the camera for one moment more , please ? Thank you . Throw the phone away . Kept my side of the bargain , matey . Ciao for now . What about the rest ? Things have changed , Arby . I can 't really tell you why , but we need them . All of them . Right now . It 's very , very important . Where is Jessica Hyde ? - Leah told me Philip Carvel 's alive ? - Yes . After all these years . I can 't tell you how that feels . It feels ... I have someone after him . We 're close . He 'll be with us soon . And this adjustment , is it ... ? He 'll tell us what it is ? Cos we 're making it , Milner . We 're making the vaccine with Janus in it . If there 's anything wrong ... He put it inside Jessica , Wilson . He would never harm her . He loved her . And you 're willing to gamble everything on that love ? Yes . Yes , of course I am . Don 't you understand yet ? I need you , Wilson . You . This whole thing comes down to the kind of people we are . You , me , Philip . What are you saying ? I don 't get this . I don 't get what you 're trying ... To get the manuscript , we killed eight children . We went into a school , shot them dead , and blamed it on Grant . I made that choice , that plan . What do you think of that ? Why are you telling me this ? There 's someone I need you to meet . Philip ? Philip . Please . Look , we know you speak English , so bloody speak it now ! Why did they put that number on his arm ? The Network . They tattooed a number on his arm . Why did they do that ? Oh , my God . Anton . So , what , Anton 's Jewish , then ? Well , I don 't know . There were loads of people in the Holocaust . He could be any one of them . Hold your hands out . Parbyndyn zayn rikht hant . Yiddish ? - Ain 't that a bit racist ? - No . Stupid . Okay . Not that one . Berühren Sie die rechte Hand . Okay . La mână dreapta . Fucking hell . You did it . It 's Romanian . He 's speaking Romanian . Right , stay here . I 'll be back soon . What the hell are you doing here ? What the hell are you doing here ? This place is disgusting . Put your food in the waste basket ! We are not your servants . We are human beings . Sorry , sorry . I ... I don 't normally work here . I just ... Dugdale ? It 's me ! Ian . What the fuck ? Have you been running ? You 're out of breath . Er ... yeah , I was . Jessica , what are you doing ? - No , no , hang on . Hang on . Wait . - No , I 'm not waiting . I 'm not fucking waiting at all . 2050 . That 's when fish stocks run out . Do you fucking get that ? - Course . It 's ... - 2080 , end of gas . 2090 , end of oil . Those figures don 't come from Greenpeace or Friends of the fucking Earth . They come from BP . If demand for fertiliser increases at current rates ... phosphates end this century , and that means no food . - I know . You don 't have to tell me . - Do you ? Because I don 't think you do . If you really knew , you 'd understand that we have no choice . You 're just like Philip . You can 't let go of morality . But what we must do puts us beyond morality . What are we doing here ? This is Paul . What do you do , Paul ? - I 'm assistant manager at ... - Tell Wilson what you really do . Paul is one of three people trained to do one very , very special thing . It 's okay . Tell him everything . If I am chosen , I will receive a call . The moment I do , I shall walk out of my life . I will go into hiding until just nine days before V Day ... when I will go to a car park in Denham . A car will be waiting . It has been adapted to store a canister ... that will have been slowly coming down in temperature for nearly 90 days . When I get there , what 's inside the canister will be thawed ... ready for release . Do you know what 's inside ? Yeah . Inside is an extremely deadly variant of Russian influenza . I will take it to a crop-duster at Denham airfield ... which I 'll fly over a 35-square-mile area , releasing the virus onto those below . I will repeat this at four other as-of-yet ... undisclosed locations all over the world . Does it bother you that we 're going to release a deadly virus ? Well , we have a vaccine . Many will die before it works . You will have killed them . - But I will have saved everyone . - Are you worried about dying ? - Chances are you will be infected . - No , I 'm not worried about dying at all . I 'm going to save the world . You should see your face . You 're worried Becky 'll find out ? I won 't tell . Why are you here , Jessica ? - Is Dugdale with them ? - No . He 's just doing what he has to . And I came looking for you . Where did you get the scars ? I , erm ... I should never have brought the manuscript to Milner . Janus wasn 't in Utopia . It was in me . I was the first person to get the vaccine . My own dad did that to me . Your dad ? You mean Philip Carvel ? So you 've nothing to worry about , Ian . I 'm sterile . Shall we do it again ? What is wrong with you ? Do you want some eggs ? I 'll make some eggs . Okay . Car pick you up in five minutes . How many will die ? Typically , mortality in a flu virus comes in waves . We hope the vaccine will kick in on the first wave ... and the virus will be eradicated . First wave , 1,200 , 1,500 people . If it goes into the second wave , it will almost certainly be tens of thousands . God . Jesus Christ , Milner . But think what we will have done , Wilson . - This can 't be the only way . - We 've been planning this for 30 years . If there was another way , we 'd know . I 've told you everything . You need to tell me if you can live with this . Can you live with this ? Wilson , can you live with ... ? I need you to say it . Yes . I can ... live with this . - Where did you get this man ? - Fuck 's it got to do with you ? - You 're the translator . Translate . - Grant . He 's ... our neighbour . - He 's ill . - Neighbour ? Live next door to your nice unfinished hotel ? Why not call 999 ? We 'll give you £ 500 cash . Pleased to meet you . My name is Marius . Let us begin . O del si lasho . That not Romanian . That Romani . Romani , language of the Roma people . Gypsy people , yes ? You racist bastards . You think all Roma is from Romania . Is not . Roma many places . Bulgaria , Poland , Spain . Romani different language , like Welsh to English . Do you speak fucking Welsh ? - Yeah , I do , actually . - Doesn 't matter . - But ... - You still racist . He was speaking Romanian . Vorbesti Romaneste ? Da , eu vorbesc limba Română . This Roma is from Romania . Coincidence . You still racist . - What 's going on ? - Becky found a way to speak to Anton ... through twat-face . Is twat-face me ? Ian was here . What ? Here ? What ... what did he want ? Who knows what that boy wants ? Are you okay , Jessica ? It 's Milner . Milner 's Mr. Rabbit . I 'm sorry . I can 't bear everything on my own . I need someone to trust . You okay ? You seem odd . I 'm not odd . Odd ? No , I 'm fine . Why ? Well , you haven 't busted my nuts about bringing Marius here , for a start . Look , are we gonna do this ? - This man is a survivor ? - Yes , he is . Ask him about it . - De unde ai luat asta ? - Am fost in Bełżec . Fuck . Bełżec concentration camp . Very bad for Roma people , very bad . Familia mea , mama , fratii , verii - toti omorati . Mother , father , brothers , cousins - whole family , all killed . Jesus Christ . He always hear the hissing ... gas released . End of war , he break incinerator . Sabotage , yes ? So , they take out the bodies , dump the bodies in the wood . He hide in bodies . Two days . He five years old . Am crescut , am vrut să imi folosesc mintea pentru face ca asa ... Grow up ... want use mind , make never happen again . - Jesus , who is this guy ? - Just carry on . But then he meet ... Mr. Rabbit ? Is that right , Mr. Rabbit ? - He say she was incredible . - She ? - Mr. Rabbit was a man . - No . He was feminine . They work together , make a thing that solve ... all world 's problems ? Is it Janus ? You made Janus ? And does Janus work , Anton ? - Yes , it will work perfectly . - Fuck . He speaks English ? But not in the way she thinks . She said we couldn 't choose . I made an adjustment . I ... I wanted to help evolution , you see . - I chose . - You mean a race ? - You chose a race ? - I did . Oh , God , I did . And which race did you choose ? You show him cat dressed like shark ? Panj familii ! - What the fuck ? - Panj familii ! - What does that mean , " panj familii " ? - I don 't know . Familii means " families " . Panj is Romani , it means " five " . Five families . - And what does " five families " mean ? - Why the fuck you ask me ? - Look , that 's where he freaked . - Yeah ? Look at the bottom . Man kills his family , Hartwell , Georgia . Hang on . There was a story like that here as well . A man killed his family out of the blue . Five families . So there 's three more ? Okay , you guys are fucking freaking me out . - What the fuck is going on ? - Oh , no . No , no , no , no . Philip is with Ian . This is how we 're going to get him . The guards here are Ml5 , by the way . They know nothing about us . Hello , Roy . My name is Milner . Where 's your brother ? Where 's Ian ? I don 't know . I 've no idea . - Are you sure , Roy ? - Yes . Why am I here ? I 'm in handcuffs . They put a hood on me . Did Ian say anything about me , Roy ? For example , did he say to you , " Milner is Mr. Rabbit " ? - What are you doing ? - No . No , he never said that . Are you sure ? He never used the phrase , " Milner is Mr. Rabbit " ? No . Who 's ... who 's Mr. Rabbit ? Keep questioning , but in one hour set him free . Send him home . Why did you do that ? - You told him that you were Mr ... - We need Philip . He 's with Ian . Roy has no idea where his brother is . But when Ian discovers that we 've killed Roy ... Well , he has a mother . Killed ? No , wait . Just hang on a minute ! In a few days , I 'm going to call either Paul or one of the other two . I 'll give a command , a command that only I know ... and in about 90 days that person will release ... the most deadly flu this world has ever seen . Everyone will take the vaccine . Everyone will willingly take Janus . It 'll be chaos , it will , but in less than 100 years ... there 'll be no more than 500 million people on this planet . We will have created Utopia . But if those three men walk out of that room knowing who I am ... then in all probability , all of that disappears . Hey . No , look , Milner . Can ... Can we just talk about this a minute ? Cos I ... I can 't ... I need you , Wilson . I need someone . I wish I could leave you as that beautiful boy that I met , but I can 't . No , I ... I can 't . I just ... I just can 't . I 've been making decisions like this for 40 years . Every day . This decision , I 'm leaving with you . I nicked a bunch of Reuters files with the same date on . There 's one here called the global news index . It catalogues all stories . What do I look up ? Er ... family annihilation ? Right , there 's five . All on the same day . The one here was in a place called Denham , off the M25 . Then the one in America , then killings in Roseira , Brazil ... Ratanda , South Africa , and Laishui near Beijing . I was working with Donaldson . Last time , when this happened . He wanted the manuscript . He has access to an experimental drug , Thoraxin , that works on Deel 's . He said if that I didn 't get him what he wanted , then I wouldn 't have the drugs . But at ... at the last minute I told him to go fuck himself , and I had that fit ... and I 'm so sorry that I haven 't told you and I 've regretted it for so long . I just wanted everything to be out in the open between us , okay ? Everything . Nice jacket . How come a knob-face like you has suddenly grown a sense ... Grant , for fuck 's sake ! We 're doing something . Will you just piss off ? Where did that come from ? - Look , Grant , I 'm sorry , I ... - Yeah ? Sorry , is it ? You made me a killer . Everyone still thinks I did it . - And then you made me dead , Ian . - Grant , put the gun ... No . You don 't tell me what to do no more . No-one does . Stay very still , mate . Stay very fucking still . They 've got Jen and Alice . They 've got my family . Michael ? I 'm gonna help you get your family back . I promise . I 'll go . I 'll slip out the back . I 'll come back tomorrow . Michael . How lovely to see you . - I wasn 't expecting to see you . - Well , no , of course not . Er ... I 'm sorry to barge in , Michael . It ... it 's just ... I 'm looking for Ian . Ian ? Why ... why do you want Ian ? Why ? - He 's wanted for murder , Michael . - Oh , yeah , yeah , of course . - Had you forgotten ? - I had . I 'd fucking ... - What an idiot . - Oh , so much on your plate . Ian believes The Network are running again . The person he killed he thought was with them . Look , I 've tried everywhere else . I thought there was a remote chance he 'd come to you . No , no , no , he 's not been here . I didn 't think so . It 's just I 'm getting rather desperate . Well , that 's it , really . I 'll be off , leave you to it . Actually , could I have some water ? - I 'll get it . Kitchen through here ? - Yeah . - Are you religious , Michael ? - No . No , not ... not at all . Thought not . Me neither . Don 't even fucking blink . What , here ? No , don 't be silly . But ... - But I have things to do . - Yeah . - That 's why I 'm killing you . - Don 't be silly , Jessica . - This isn 't ... I mean , this ... - It is . It really is . Your father 's alive . Look at me . Look at me , Jessica . I 'm not lying . You can see that . He 's with Ian . Ian has Philip . Let 's go see him . Together . When you kill , you don 't feel nothing , do you ? No . For me it 's like unscrewing a bottle to get to the water . Yeah . And no-one fucks with you . They do . They just do it different . Will you teach me to shoot ? Yes . Will you teach me to kill ? No , I don 't think I will . Where are the others ? Up there , talking to Anton , now they 've figured out who he is . What do you mean , who he is ? Who is Anton ? I 'm ... not really supposed to say . Look at this : Hartwell , Georgia , where the American bloke killed his family . Middle of fucking nowhere . The only thing that 's interesting is that it has an airfield . Light aircraft , crop-dusters , that sort of thing . - Okay . - And it 's 80 miles from Atlanta airport ... the busiest airport in the world . It 's the same with Denham . It has a tiny airfield , but it 's en route to Heathrow and Gatwick . It ... it 's the same with all these places . If you were going to spread flu , that 's how you 'd do it . Crop-dusters in the middle of nowhere ... but en route to some of the busiest airports in the world . Where these families were killed , that 's where they 're releasing the virus from . But why ... why kill families ? Why ... why kill innocent ... To cover our tracks . They are sleeper agents . Trained or brainwashed . Their job is to tend the virus . When they get the call , they place it in a designated location ... then they kill themselves and their families . All traces gone . That 's how we work , you see . Families . Children . We are ... appalling . Dovada . Dovada . - Dovada . - What does that mean , " dovada " ? Dovada means " proof " . It means " proof " . Why you got the fucking gun ? Go . Go , go , go . Go on . Ian ! No , no , no , please ! Please don 't . Please . You 're coming with us . Don 't move ! Don 't move ! Chi sim bi-doshalo . Grant ... Grant ! Don 't . No , no , don 't do that . Don 't . Please . Please don 't do that . Don 't . Please . Please !

 Hurry up . It 's floored . I 'm going as fast as I can . You 've got to go faster , man ! It 's not slowing down . I know . Go ! Come on ! Faster ! We 're running out of lake . Faster ! Come on ! We 're going to have to beach it . Get ready to jump ! We 're not going to make it ! ICETASTROPHE Jingle bells , your breath smells Why don 't you Leave work ? If you keep staring at your screen # You 'll turn into a jerk # Very funny . Thank you . So did you sleep here last night or ... No . You were wearing this yesterday . Yeah , okay . Look at this . This is something . I 'm telling you , check that out . Yes , it is an asteroid . We 've been tracking that for weeks . It 's the size of this desk . It 's not going to survive the burn up through our atmosphere just like hundreds of millions before it . Yeah , but this flaring right here , that 's a temperature shift . How do you explain that ? It 's Santa 's sleigh . My God , that is Santa 's sleigh . You discovered Santa 's sleigh . I 'm serious , Neil , this is not normal . Neither is working over Christmas . Come on , let 's go . Can 't I stay ? I mean , my parents are in Hong Kong . I 'm going to my aunt 's tomorrow . I hate my aunt . Just give me the keys and I 'll lock up . Alex , it 's Christmas . You don 't get extra credit for staying . I 'm not asking for it . I just want more time with this . I just want to see it through entry . Okay , fine . Suit yourself . But I 'm telling you , it 's going to burn up into nothing . You get a lump of coal for Christmas . - Okay , a bah humbug to you . - Unbelievable . - Merry Christmas . - Merry Christmas . What a dork . Okay . What the hell ? Yes ! That worked out pretty damn well , didn 't it ? Hey , moron twins . What the hell are you guys doing ? How many times have I told you that dynamite is for avalanche control ? It 's not a toy . Knuckleheads . I mean , he made me do it , so . - Really ? - Yeah . Man ... It 's a holiday , all right ? Look around , there 's nobody here , TJ and I were just having a bit of fun . Really ? Fun ? With dynamite ? You keep playing with that stuff you 're going to take an arm off . Then what 's your mom going to say ? She 'd probably just blame you like she always does . Exactly . So , you want to blow your arm off , then you do it on her weekend , not mine . Sorry , Dad , we were just a little bored . Really ? Did you fix that lift kit I told you to fix ? Yes , I did it like two hours ago . All right , well , good . Mr. Ratchet , we were hoping to go downtown , meet some friends , go to the , you know , Christmas thing . Yeah , yeah . I know about it . Forgive me if I don 't want to listen to Ben Crooge spout off about what a damned philanthropist he is . Everyone seems to think that expanding the resort might bring more business . Be good for the town . Son , everything comes at a cost . Ben doesn 't seem to be taking that into account these days . - Yet you still work for him . - I do . It doesn 't mean I blindly support everything he does . This isn 't right . Not this way . Hey , it is a Christmas celebration . I agree with this . - I could go for some celebration . - I could celebrate . You could celebrate , I could celebrate , you could celebrate . Enough . Then you got to go to your mother 's . Yeah , it is her year . Tell you what . I 'll give you a ride into town . I got to pick up some supplies anyway . Nice . Kind father . He 's a good man . - The best . - Yeah . Merry Christmas ! Merry Christmas , everybody ! Merry Christmas , everyone ! Happy Holidays ! Looks like Santa puked all over the mayor 's car . - What do you expect ? - Yeah . Pretty much that . See you around , Dad . This place is a circus , once again . What she sees in you I have no idea . - It must be my winning personality . - Well , it 's definitely not your looks . Very funny . Hey , better watch out for Mr. Crooge . He loves employees chasing after his daughter , right ? Well , you see I don 't actually work for him . - My dad does . - I think that makes it worse . Probably . Yeah . See you around . Merry Christmas ! Merry Christmas ! Merry Christmas ! Saint Nick . Charlie , Merry Christmas ! You 're looking very jolly . I thought you weren 't coming in for this . Me ? Well , I 've got a good excuse . He 's still signing my paychecks . - What are you doing ? - Celebrating the holidays . I see that . This fake snow is a nice touch . Yeah . Global warming is that way it is . We 'll be lucky if this town ever sees a white Christmas again . - How are you holding up ? - Fake it till you make it , right ? Don 't worry about me , Charlie . I 'll be okay . He can take my store , but he can 't take my spirit . - Come on . - We have to make this quick . If I miss my dad 's thing , he 'll kill me . Okay . And if he saw that , he 'd kill both of us . Well , see , your father is one thing , that brother of yours , I really think he 's onto us . You 're paranoid . Look , I don 't want to hide anymore , Marley . I know . I wish things were different . Good to see you . Scott , where is that sister of yours ? We have to start . How should I know ? Is it my turn to put on her radio collar ? Maybe try giving her a call ? Do we have to do this now ? No . No , we don 't . But we do have to do this right now . Merry Christmas , Marley . But I didn 't bring your present . That 's okay , just open it . And keep in mind I wanted it to be bigger , obviously . My God . It 's a diamond . Barely , but you know , I saved up for it , so I hope you like it . - Tim , I love it . - Good . They 're trying to get a hold of me . Sure they are . Hey look , is that a shooting star ? Hi , you 've reached Marley . Please leave me a message . She 's not answering . Well , forget it . We have to do without her . Thank you , everyone , for coming . We are here today to break ground on a brand new retail complex . Now , in doing this , we should also say our thank yous and our goodbyes to all these stores around us . Yeah , right . We honor the role they 've played in our town 's history . It 's an exciting time for our town . We 've already begun construction on Lakeview Mountain . What is that ? My God . Come on , we need to go . This marks a new beginning for Lennox , finally bringing us into the 21st century . Prosperity is coming to Lennox . Everybody look out . TJ . Neil , it 's me . It hit . In Lennox , 80 miles northeast of Olympia . I 'm heading there now . If you get bored of singing Christmas carols , you know where to find me . Get on the phone to Governor Michaels . Okay . Crystal ? Crystal , you okay ? You guys , take your mom to the bowling alley . Are you okay ? You sure ? There 's an ambulance right there . Miles . Miles , get up . What the hell was that ? I have no idea . You good ? Can you stand ? I need your help . There 's a lot injured , we got to get them out of here . - You up to it ? - Okay , yeah , go . - Is it on fire ? - No , it 's freezing . Is he alive ? I don 't think so . What the ... Ben ! Help me . My hands are stuck . What the ... Ben . Help me , please . Ben ! Please , help me ! Miles ! Miles . Tell the Governor this is way bigger than anything we can handle . We need some help out here . Wait , wait , wait ! Mom ! Dad ! Marley . Mom ! God . I 'm so sorry ! Scott , you seen my dad around ? Yeah . Scott ! Scott , what 's wrong with you ? Hey , enough . Enough . What is going on ? Why don 't you ask your daughter ? Enough . Now , folks , listen up . Listen , I just got off the phone with the governor 's office . Now , we 've cordoned off the area where the meteor hit . Do not approach it . I want you to go home and stay there . And if you live downtown , you stay with a friend or a family member , all right ? Thank you . Dad . I was so worried . Tim . - You okay ? - Yeah , it 's fine . What happened ? Let me look at you . - What hit you ? - Scott Crooge . You want to know where Marley was ? She was sneaking around with him . Is that true ? Yeah . We 'll talk about this later . Go home . All of you . Now ! You go home , too . Call your mother . Tell her what happened and that you 'll be late . I 'll meet you at the house . Be safe . It 's getting worse . Why aren 't you leaving with the rest of them ? Taking that son of yours home . I 'm here to help . We don 't need you . The mayor put calls in . The cavalry should be here any minute . Ben , I 'm not working for you right now . I 'm here to help the people of this town . Something you lost sight of a long time ago . Well , now you 're not working for me at all . Really ? You think that matters right now ? State troopers are here . You need to warn them . They have no idea what they 're walking into . What are you doing ? Charlie . Heard you had a meteor strike . How cool is that ? Well , people are dead , so not very . You got experience with this kind of thing ? Experience ? What do you mean ? Something is down there . I don 't know what it is , but it 's not stopping . Look , we 're the closest division . It takes time to pull together all the resources to get a full squad . We got this . I wouldn 't go there if I were you . It seems to be okay to me . - Get out of there ! - What the hell is that ? Come on , Gibbons . Keep going . Get in here . Hello ? Hello ? - Do you think it 's over ? - I don 't even know what it is . Let me in ! It 's me . Get the door . A little help would be nice . What the hell is this , Charlie ? Damned if I know , but it 's a hell of a lot more than just a meteor storm . Yeah , no kidding . Did you see that storm ? We all saw it . We need to get everybody out of town . Send them over to Tannen . He 's right . None of us is equipped to deal with this . I 'll call Faye , see if she can take some at the community center . Tell her to get whatever resources she needs . I 'll cover the expense . Okay . Need some help over here . So yeah , we can move that to Monday , that frees up Tuesday . Excuse me . Faye , Charlie 's on the line for you . He says it 's urgent . You got that ? Excuse me . Are you okay ? Is Tim okay ? He didn 't call you ? No . And I 've tried calling but I can 't get through . All right , look , I 'm sure he 's fine . Listen , the mayor is evacuating town . Everyone ? What 's going on out there ? A meteor hit in the center of Main Street . It 's total chaos over here . We need to evacuate . Can you make room for us over there ? Of course . I 'll make the preparations . All right , thanks . And Ben said he 'd take care of any extra expenses . Really ? Yeah . When should I expect you ? I 'll start sending folks over immediately . I take it that means you won 't be with them . I 'm going to stay here , make sure nobody gets left behind . Charlie . Faye . Come on , somebody 's got to do it . It doesn 't always have to be you . Just be careful , okay ? You know I will . See you soon . Okay , bye . I just talked to Faye . She said she 's going to get ready for us . I need you to take care of the evac communications . Tell people to dress warmly , bring food and bedding . - I 'll be back soon . - What ? Wait . Charlie . What are you doing ? Where are you going ? It 'll take us a while to get these wounded out of here and the back-up generator is about to go out . I got to get home , grab my tools , keep the lights and the heat on until we can get them out of here . Tim . What are you doing ? - Hey , did you call your mother ? - I tried , the phone lines are down . Internet and cable , too . Honestly , we 're lucky we even have power . Everybody 's being evacuated to Tannen until we can figure this out . - You should get going . - What about you ? What are you packing for ? Ben and Mayor Gibbons are over at the clinic . There 's a lot of wounded and their power is failing . I 'm going to see if I can keep the generator running . Here . You should gear up . It 's getting cold out there . Was TJ at the clinic , Dad ? I stopped by his house on the way here . He wasn 't there . No . No , he wasn 't . Look , everybody 's being evacuated . You need to get out of here . Tim , now . I saw that thing come down on us . The meteor . It split into two , changed colors . It was the craziest thing . What do you mean split into two and changed colors ? I didn 't see that . Where did the other part land ? I don 't know . It was headed towards Mount Dickens , though . That 's far away from civilization . That 's a good sign . Hey , Tim . You can talk to me about anything . You know that , right ? - Even if you don 't think I approve . - Okay . You know that dent on the back of your car ? - That was me . - Very funny . You know , Dad , you can stand up - to Ben Crooge just a little bit . - Is that so ? Well , I did today , and I got fired . - Okay , very funny . - I 'm not kidding . Look , your mom 's waiting for you . You should get out of here . I won 't be far behind you . Don 't worry about me . For luck . Merry Christmas , kid . Hurry up . I did it for your own good . Screw off , Scott , you 're not my dad . Enough . Both of you . There will be time to discuss this , but right now we are all going to Tannen until they sort this out . Grab your bags . Marley , you 'll ride with Scott . - What ? - Why ? Because you are brother and sister , and one way or another you are going to get along . What about you ? I 'm taking the Parsons . Their car is in the shop . Move ! What the hell was that ? That 's it . We 're all leaving now . Okay . Come on , let 's go . Hell . Get in ! - What ? - Let 's go . Move ! Get in the car now ! Hurry ! Is that normal for around here ? Nope . It went the other way . God . Now what ? You like boats ? Untie the boat . Come on . - It 's coming , come on . - I know . Hurry , let 's go ! - Go ! - Hold on . Come on . How are we doing ? Hurry up . It 's floored . I 'm going as fast as I can . Got to go faster , man . It 's not slowing down . I know . Go ! Come on . - Faster ! - I 'm running out of lake . Faster ! Come on ! We 're going to have to beach it . We 're not going to make it . Hang on . Get ready to jump . Go ! Go , come on , go , go ! Ben . Something 's happening west of the lake . - Another meteor ? - I don 't know . Listen , Stu Carson just came in . He 's covered in frost bite and he 's screaming about flash freezing . According to him , Highway 10 is completely blocked with giant chunks of ice . I guess the idea of all this stopping just went out the window . I don 't care if you have to put ten people to a car , we need to evacuate . The only way out of this town now is the back roads . All right . - What happened back there ? - It 's called a flash freeze . But I 've only read accounts . I 've never experienced one in person . Well , I 've seen quite a few in the last couple of hours . Up this way . And none of this before the meteor hit ? Wait , no . How do you know about the meteor ? - Who exactly are you anyway ? - I 'm Alex . Alex Novak . I 'm a grad student at the university getting a PhD in astrophysics . I was tracking that meteor . Charlie Ratchet . Nice to meet you . You sure picked a hell of a way to spend your Christmas . I 'd say . So , what happened back there ? You 've never seen anything like that before ? No . That 's why if it is linked to the meteor ... Wait , what do you mean linked to the meteor ? How ? It 's so far away from here . If I 'm right , it 's spreading . I mean ... That 's why I need to see the impact crater as soon as possible . Well , I can take you as far as the clinic . Last I knew the mayor was there . You and he can discuss what you want to do from there . Are you old school or new school ? What ? I think I know a way we can make up some time . Let 's go . Right behind you . What , they didn 't teach you how to snowboard in school , Novak ? Just keep going ! - Thank God you 're okay . - I 'm fine . - Your lip . - I tripped . It 's nothing . Any news ? No . Only that it 's bad . - Dad 's still out there , obviously . - I 'm aware . Mom , have you , you haven 't happened to see Marley Crooge around , have you ? No , not yet . Hey , I need some man power . Let 's help unload . Sure thing . - Hey , how 's it going ? - This is great . I got that . I just got a bunch of boxes back here . Great , thanks . Hey , I 'll be right back . Marley . - Here , I got that . - Thanks . What the hell is this ? Scott , stop it ! What 's your problem , buddy ? You 're blocking the road ! Really ? Scott , stop ! - What is your problem ? - My truck 's broken . - Can we give you a hand ? - That 'd be great . Just go back to the car . I 'll deal with this . Hi . Sorry , what 's going on ? What 's the problem ? Charlie , where the heck have you been ? We have got no phones , we 've got a little bit of power but the generator 's bit ... Who 's this ? I 'm Alex Novak , from the university . Did the governor send you ? No , I was following the meteor as part of my research project . Charlie , the generator is running hot . Where 's your tools ? - I had to ditch them . - Excuse me . I need to find the meteorite . Where is it ? Middle of Main Street , for all the good it 'll do you . - It 's the eye of the storm . - Okay , which direction ? It 's suicide going back out there . Look , I 'm going . This is obviously not your garden variety meteor , and I 'm going to need a sample . Thank you . If it wasn 't for you , well , I think you know . I ... I 'm going to take this . Merry Christmas . All right guys , let 's go . Come on . We can 't just let her go out there alone . Really ? Nice . Keep this on channel five . Now , Charlie , hold on a second now . We 're almost done evacuating here . When that last transport leaves ... - We 're out of here . - That 's the Christmas spirit . Let 's go ahead and get the coolers and make sure there 's plenty of sandwiches , okay ? Okay , thanks . Faye ? Crystal . What you 're doing is great . Thank you so much for helping us . What 's wrong ? I can 't reach Marley or Scott . No one 's seen them . There 's no cell reception . I saw Jim dropping people off from the clinic . They 're not there , either . I 'm really worried , Faye . Hey , it 's all right . We 'll find them . They should be here by now . This is crazy . I 've been tracking this meteor for weeks . Never in a million years did I believe something like this would or even could happen . All the more reason to stay away . I 'm not asking you to come with me . That thing has killed everybody that 's gotten near it . - It didn 't kill you . - Not yet . I don 't think it 's such a good idea . I know . I just need to get some readings . Does this area have a history of tremors ? No , it started with the impact . Same as the ice storms . All right , we really need to get out of here . - Easy there . - Hi , Rob . Sorry , I just thought I ... - What 's wrong ? - Felt something . Have you seen Tim ? I don 't know where he went off to . Yeah , I just saw him head outside . Alex . Alex , you okay ? Yeah . - You ? - I think so . Here , hold this . - Your leg . - Yeah . Okay , look , this thing , whatever it is , this is a major breakthrough . There 's no precedent for something like this . Yeah , well , I 'm no astronomer , but I 'm pretty sure the meteor isn 't supposed to change the weather . This meteorite , technically , now that it 's hit the ground , you 're right . Where are we ? In the old mine shaft underneath the town . It 's freezing down here . - Why is that ? - I think that meteorite is causing it . I think so , too . It 's amazing . Scientists have debated for years whether the water on Earth originally came from the ice in meteors , but the Earth has so much water that hypothesis could never be supported with evidence . But this , this is some serious evidence . Well , congratulations . We 're not climbing out of there . I think if we go that way , it 'll take us back to the clinic . Alex . Alex , you 're going the wrong way . She 's just like my freaking kid . Are you kidding me ? This is unbelievable . I need a sample . Are you crazy ? What do you mean ? It 's happening . We need to get out of here . Let 's move , come on ! Take cover ! Get down ! Get inside , now ! My God ! Hey , did you feel that , man ? Okay , we got to get going now . Okay ? Now ! Chill ! Scott ! Run ! Marley . Scott , run ! No ! No , Marley ! Run ! Run ! Wait . Wait ! Alex ? - What happened ? - I don 't know . We 're still alive . Come on , let me help you up . Here , take this . I think these lanterns may have saved us . I mean , as a heat source . Look at the ground . It 's a giant circle . No , it can 't be that simple . Sometimes the right answer is the most obvious one . You still want that sample ? No . Let 's go . And another one for the hungry kids . There you go . Did you find Tim yet ? He left . I think he went looking for Marley . - Heli-skiing . - What ? Give me your phone . Ben bought a heli-skiing company last summer . Cole ? This is Crystal . I need you to drop everything right now . I have a crisis . My God . My ... Help ! Help ! Scott ! Scott ! Scott . Scott ! My God . My ... No . Scott ! Ben , Mayor Gibbons , do you copy ? Over . Ben , Mayor Gibbons , do you copy ? Ben , do you copy ? Over . That meteorite is altering the entire micro-climate of this area . So nothing like this has ever been documented before ? You 've never seen anything like this ? Documented ? No . I find that hard to believe . There 's evidence of all sorts of crazy stuff that doesn 't add up . Our world has only been scientifically aware for a few thousand years . Do you know what that amounts to in a 4.5 billion-year-old planet ? The blink of an eye . That 's precisely why I got into science . Well , we better get you out of town or you 're not going to see graduation . If this keeps up , we 're not going to make it past Christmas . What the hell is that ? God , it looks like an igloo . - Come with me . - Where are we going ? To do a little last minute Christmas shopping . Cole , this is Faye Ratchet , can you hear me ? Loud and clear , Faye . We 're about five miles out keeping our eyes peeled for any stranded people . Highway 5 is blocked , the passage is buried . The only way out of Lennox is on foot . Can you see anything moving ? Cars ? People ? Not so far . Me and Gary aren 't exactly search and rescue , but we 'll do our best . Thank you . I can 't tell you how much this means to us . Hey , no worries . It wouldn 't be Christmas unless someone needed saving , right ? Gary , let 's split up . I 'll start with the city limits and search south . You take everything to the north . Roger that , big C. I 'm on my way . Copy . Scott ! Scott . Scott ! No ! God ! My God ! Scott ! Scott . Marley . - Marley . - My God , Tim . It 's okay . It 's all right . Come on , we have to move . Come on , we have to go . Scott ! No ! You sure about this ? Yeah . Ben , Mayor Gibbons , do you read me ? Over . Anybody copy ? Over . Damn . We 're too late . Ben ? Are you okay ? No , Ben . It 's not your fault . Okay ? - Come on , get up . - I panicked , I ran inside here . And hid . I don 't know why I lived . And I didn 't save him . I didn 't save anyone . What have I done ? Charlie ... I closed the door on them . I hid in the boiler room . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . It 's okay . Ben , it 's all right . It 's okay . You 'll be all right . Let me help you up . Slowly . Come on . Let 's get out of here . This is incredible . It looks like the North Pole . It 's an Arctic wasteland . What do you mean ? There 's nothing left . Snow and ice as far as I can see . There 's no buildings , no cars . There 's nothing . Lennox is gone . Roger that , Cole . I haven 't found anyone either . I 'll head towards town , do another sweep . Hey ! - Over here . - Hey . We 're down here . Wait ! They 've got to see us . Hey ! What the hell ? I 'm looking at Dickens Peak . There 's a whole area that 's untouched . There 's no snow on it at all . I 'm going to check it out . - We 're down here . - Wait . We 're here , please . Wait ! Stop ! - Stop ! - We got to move . Can anyone hear me ? Hello ? Great . We have to get out of here , we have to get to Tannen . Maybe not . What are you thinking ? What choice do we have ? No good choices . I 'm just trying to find the least crappy one . I 'm thinking there may be a way to stop this thing . No , we run , we get as far away as possible . Run where , Ben ? We have no idea how far this thing is spreading or how fast . If we have a chance to stop it , it 's now . I 'm not absolute about this , but heat , extreme heat , is a reactant . That 's been made clear . So if we can produce enough heat ... At the source of the impact , We 'd have a shot . A shot at what ? Killing ourselves ? It 's about re-balancing nature . A subatomic chain reaction is taking place . It 's not magic , it 's science . And it can be stopped if we can produce enough heat at the source . How about dynamite ? Yeah , if there 's enough , maybe . Yeah , there 's enough . I sign the invoices , I should know . Let 's get to the resort . Yeah . Look . Listen , I 've covered the whole area around town . I haven 't seen anyone . It 's creepy , so ... I 'm going to circle back to the clinic building now . See if I can find anyone there . Do you hear that ? Right there . Hey . Over here . Hey . Yo , yo , yo . I got survivors . Three of them . Two men , one woman . I 'm landing now . Awfully nice of you to arrange transportation for us . Watch your step on the way down . Hey , Marley , come on . Get up . You 're freezing . - We have to keep moving . - No . Marley , we have to keep moving . Come on . - Come on . - Okay . It 's coming back . - Come on . - No . Wait , wait . I think I see something . It looks like two people near Avery Wood . I 'm going to head lower , check it out . Who is it ? Can you see who it is ? Not yet . Stand by . Over here , over here . Come on . Look . Yeah , it looks like Tim Ratchet and Marley . Crystal , come quick ! - He saw us . - Thank God . - Come on . - Okay . They spotted Tim and Marley . Boy , folks , it 's definitely them . Christmas has come early . Ho , ho , ho . I 'm setting her down . My God . No ! Gary . My God . Look out . Look out . Gary . Come in , Gary . Gary , do you copy ? Gary . Gary . Cole , what 's happening ? Faye . Faye , is that you ? Charlie ? Yeah , it 's me . Ben 's here , too . Ben . Ben . Something happened . Gary saw Tim and Marley near Avery Wood , but then he yelled and ... We 're heading that way . Faye , I need you to listen to me . This thing is spreading and it is cold . Arctic storm cold . Barricade yourselves inside . Build fires . Any heat source that can survive a blackout . Do not go outside . We have a plan to stop this . We ? Ben , me , and Alex Novak , an astrophysicist . Faye , I 'm serious . Do not try to evacuate . Build up as much heat as you possibly can inside . That 's your only protection . I understand . Charlie , the kids . Faye , I 'll find them . I swear . We got this . Marley . Marley . Are you okay ? My leg , it 's stuck . God , I 'm so cold . The helicopter , it 's gone . Tim , it 's over . We 'll never make it out here . We 'll freeze to death . Just put this on . Get up . Look at me . Stamp your feet . Do anything to stay warm . All right , trust me . Look at me . Look at me . We are going to make it , okay ? We are going to make it out of this , all right ? We are . Just think warm thoughts . I 'm going to be right back . Where are you going ? I 'm going to go start a fire . I 'll get the radio in just a minute . I 've got to go outside and deal with something before they board this place up . Oops , here you go . Faye . - We 're going to Billings . - What ? I 've got a four-wheel drive , We 'll be okay . You don 't understand . Highway 5 is blocked , so is the pass . - There is no way out . - We 'll take our chances . Don 't do this . Charlie said to stay inside . He was adamant . Look , we made our decision . I know those roads like the back of my hand . - We 've got to get help . - Rob , don 't . Don 't worry . We 'll be back with help . - See anything ? - No . Cole , what 's wrong ? The cold makes everything a little bit sticky . Wait , over there on the right . Now all we need are the chestnuts . I think I prefer some hot cocoa . With marshmallows . Did you hear something ? Maybe it was just Santa on a dry run . Everything 's freezing up . What ? God . We 're going down . Everything 's freezing up . Mayday . Mayday . We 're going down . Hello ? Hello ? Come on . Hello ? My latlong is north 45 : 47 : 12 west 1 : 08 : 32 : 14 . Brace yourselves . Tim ? Yeah ? Thank you . For coming back for me . Of course . I love you . I love you , too . Marley , Tannen is right over that pass . Okay , now , if we make it there , it 's hot cocoa for real . I promise . You 're serious ? We can 't miss Christmas morning , can we ? Come on . Charlie ? Is everybody okay ? Cole . Cole . What about Cole ? He 's gone . We need to get out of here . You okay ? Yeah . Hello ? Ben ? Cole ? Hello ? Ben ? I can 't see a thing . Come on . My God , look at that thing . We got to keep moving . The dynamite is that way and Gary said that the kids went that way . So we got to split up . Well , I 'm going to destroy that thing . You 're going to lose your evidence . - I know . - I 'll go after the kids . You 're the explosives expert , anyway . Try not to blow yourself up . That 's funny . It 's what I keep telling Tim . I 'll see you guys in Tannen . Good luck . You , too . Let 's go . Okay , good job guys . Help , let us in . Open it . Okay . Open up . Here he comes . Just a minute . Okay . Crystal . Come quick . Crystal . Watch your step . Okay , here you go . Faye . Marley . My God , I was so worried . What happened ? He saved me . Tim saved me . Where 's ... Where 's Scott ? Mom . What ? Where ... Where 's ... Where ... I 'm sorry . No . I 'm sorry . No . No . Scott ! Marley . Tim . Well , I was hoping for a white Christmas . Be careful what you wish for . Yeah , no kidding . What do you know about dynamite ? Boom . Come on . Marley . Marley ! Scott . Come on . I 'm here . You 're freezing . Let 's get you in front of the fire . Okay . Are you okay ? Let 's warm you up . - That sounded close . - Yeah , come on . - Excuse us , guys . - Sit here . Thank you . - We got to go . - Not without my gear . Let 's move . Leave it . Get on ! Come on . Hang on . It 's right behind us ! Hand me a stick of dynamite . Here . Are you insane ? Yes . Now , throw it . Did you see that ? It knocked it back . Hang on . Grab another one . - It 's working . - Yes . We 've got this . Let 's go blow up that meteorite . No ! The dynamite . What do we do ? We haul ass . It 's right behind us . We 're not going to make it . What is that ? I don 't know . Just go . Hold on . Okay . Okay , now this is a magic donkey . He is going to keep you safe . Okay ? This is incredible . I 've never seen anything like this before . Yesterday , this entire area was covered in snow , and the town was green and now it 's reversed . There 's definitely something crazy going on . Crap , Charlie , look at that . What ? Something is affecting the storm . The meteor . What about it ? My son said he saw the meteor split in two before it hit town . He said one of the pieces was headed in this direction . Right . I saw this weird heat shift when I was tracking the meteor through space . One piece gives off uncontrollable cold , the other heat . Together they make up a normal meteor , but split them apart ... We are screwed . We got to get them back together again . What are you doing ? I 'm finding that missing piece . Look . We 're trapped . That 's a strange crater . If elves could show up on flying reindeer right now , it would be the strangest thing I 'd seen today . Shouldn 't we ... Shouldn 't we what ? This isn 't an archaeological expedition . Let 's get it and go . - Hot ? - Yeah , it 's a little toasty . These gloves are heat resistant . That 's more than a little heat . How are we going to transport it ? That should help . That 's amazing . Take a look . It 's okay . # Jingle bells Jingle bells # # Jingle all the way # # What fun It is to ride # # In a one horse Open sleigh , hey # # Jingle bells Jingle bells # # Jingle all the way # Hey , you good ? Yeah , okay . It 's huge . Right . There it is . Okay , now be careful . I plan on it . Wait . No one 's going to believe me . This is the scientific discovery of the century and no one 's going to believe me . Well , if it 's any consolation , I believe you . Just think , you 've done enough good deeds for the day that you won 't be on Santa 's naughty list for the rest of your life . You should get out of here . Are you kidding ? I 'm not going to miss this . Merry Christmas . It 's stuck . Charlie . I 'm stuck . Alex . Hey , are you okay ? Okay . Are you okay ? We need to get out of here . Come on . How did this happen ? Marley . Dad . Ben . Crystal . Mr. Crooge . Did you see my dad out there ? We were together for a while . We split up . Dad . Dad . It 's Dad . It 's him . Dad . Are you okay ? I 'm fine , fine . This is Alex , the scientist I told you about . This is my son , Tim , and Faye . Hi . Nice to meet you . Ben . It 's good to see you . You , too .

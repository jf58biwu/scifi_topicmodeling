 - No . - [ GUNSHOT ] [ SHE SPEAKS ITALIAN ] [ GASPS ] Angelo . No ! I 'm so sorry , Jack . - In the future , are we together ? - We can 't be cos one day you 're going to die and I won 't . Then we forget the future and we make a promise . I 'm sorry , Angelo . This is the story of my life . Captain Harkness , the last mortal man . You 'll want to come with me , because I can take you to the one man who knows how the miracle began . Who 's that ? Angelo . Angelo Colasanto . They 're with me . They 've agreed to leave their weapons behind . - But Esther 's going to stay outside . - Why ? What for ? She 's going to keep an open relay to a hard drive back in Los Angeles . If we go through those doors and disappear , then we have a record . OK ? So tell your goons to leave her alone . Come on , Angelo 's inside . He talked about you all the time , Jack . His immortal man in old New York . He never forgot . You telling me the whole world got screwed because two gay guys had a hissy fit ? - Rex , get back in your cave . - Come on , give me a break . You inspired him . You proved immortality was possible . And he devoted the rest of his life to finding out how to live forever . And he did it ? He 's still alive ? He 's still young ? Oh , yes , he 's still alive . Angelo Colasanto is still very much alive ... but he 's not young . My grandfather waited all this time to live forever . And his wish came true ... too late . What 's wrong with him ? At his age ? Just about everything . You can leave us alone , thanks . Of course , ma 'am . What happened to your eye ? I was just born with it . It 's him . You must be horrified . - Why would you say that ? - Well , he 's grown so old . That 's how I see the whole world . He 's still young compared to me . This is for Esther . Just keeping an open line to make sure we 're all safe . After everything I 've heard about Torchwood technology , you 're going to rely on an open handset ? Yeah , well , we had to leave LA in a hurry , thanks to someone I could mention . REX : Anyway , what the hell 's going on with the stock market ? They 're falling . It 's been inevitable ever since Miracle Day , which I reckon is part of the plan . So you put a gun to my daughter 's head for what , for this ? ! - So you get your revenge on Jack ? - We weren 't trying to hurt you . I was carrying out my grandfather 's final wish ... to keep you safe . - So you don 't want him dead , then . - W-wait .. Do you mean , you were protecting me ? Hell of a way of going about it . There 's a crucial distinction . My grandfather cared for you . I don 't . You might be important in some way we 've yet to work out . So It 's best to keep you intact . But that 's as far as the sentiment goes . So why the hell , you know ... Bollocks . Start again . Any chance of a drink ? I could murder a pint of bitter right now . Thanks , Gwen . I 'll have a vodka . These are all of you . Some of these are ... That 's Torchwood . That 's Cardiff . When was that ? - The ' 70s . - A mustache ? My God , Jack . He watched you for decades . But he never made contact . You may not be ashamed of being old , but ... he was . Hold on now . He didn 't cause this ? Angelo didn 't cause the miracle ? No , he lived this long through natural means . He kept his body at a temperature two degrees below normal , he controlled his caloric intake , kept his blood pressure below 110 . - Does that work ? - Oh , yes . Prolonging life is simple . But no-one 's worked out how to make a profit at it , so it 's not advertised . And the whole time he was looking for immortality ? It 's not as impossible as it sounds . You are not the only remarkable thing on this Earth , Jack . Consider the jellyfish . The species turritopsis nutricula is considered to be immortal . Its cells undergo a process called transdifferentiation . Quite simply , it can revert to a younger state , and grow old again . And then repeat , without limit . It 's possible there are individual jellyfish upon this planet that have existed for thousands and thousands of years . I 'm not as special as I thought . You never were . Even within the human body , cancer cells are immortal . Stem cells , in theory , they can divide forever . And this is the research that Angelo investigated . Well , they all did , because my grandfather wasn 't alone . - Who were the others ? - Well , the story says that it started with three men , each representing a different family . And when you were being murdered over and over again , these three men came to witness your resurrection . I saw them . They made a deal . They formed an alliance to purchase the power of resurrection . And when you escaped , the three families swore that they 'd find the gift again . What were their names ? The Ablemarch family , the Costerdane family and the Frines . Ablemarch , Costerdane , Frines . Did you get that ? Ablemarch , Costerdane and . . - Is Caster with a T-E-R ? - Is Coster with a T-E-R ? - Yeah , T-E-R . And ... - Spell Frines . - Could you spell Frines ? - F-R-I-N-E-S . F-R-I-N-E-S . Trace ' em . I want you to find every member of those three families . Rex , this is nine decades later . Look , I don 't care if it 's 500,000 people . I want you to find them all ... now . So ... what happened then ? 1928 - what did they do next ? Well , they lost Jack , but they still had his blood . No , no , no , no ! [ SHE SPEAKS ITALIAN ] I thought they were draining it away ... but they were collecting it . All they had to do was figure out how to use it . But that doesn 't work . There 's nothing special about my blood in itself . That 's not what made me immortal . Then why would the three families want to kill you ? I don 't know . Whatever they were planning , my grandfather wasn 't included . I think they considered him ... inappropriate . [ LAUGHS ] What 's inappropriate ? He loved a man . He did go on to have a family of his own , and I think he loved my grandmother very much , but he never lied about you , Jack . And I think that Ablemarch , Costerdane and Frines found that ... a little ... unfortunate . As a result , Angelo was forced to watch them from afar . Made enough money , by the looks of it . Well , Jack told him enough to navigate his way through the 20th century and make a profit . But what did these families do to the world ? They ... they started in Manhattan . 80 years later , the whole of the planet becomes immortal . - And I become mortal . - In 1998 we intercepted a message . It was just one word - " Blessing " . JACK : We 've heard about the Blessing . They found it . Whatever the Blessing is , the three families found it . - Now it 's time that we found them . - GWEN : Mmm . Esther , you got any news for us ? This is ... plain weird . There 's no-one called Ablemarch or Costerdane or Frines . I mean , literally , there 's no such names . There 's nothing . It 's blank . They don 't exist . REX : Esther ? Esther ? Esther ? I think there 's trouble . How long till Shapiro gets here ? He was out of the airport right behind us . We 've got maybe five minutes till the rest of the CIA descends . Five minutes should be enough . Bring her . We 've got to finish this before the rest of the CIA arrives . - Shit . - What is it , Rex ? What 's happening ? Just tell us where we can find the three families , quickly . You 'll never find them , that 's the whole point . They came out of New York with the motivation of keeping this secret . Where 's the best place to hide yourself ? - In plain sight . - Nobody move ! - This is the CIA . - Everybody , stay where you are . That 's an order . You , with the others . - Hey ... - Matheson , don 't try anything . We are arresting all of you for violations of the Miracle Security Act . This is the same as treason now , folks . And I want a word with Rex . Right now . Secure him . - Who the hell are you ? - Don 't move . - That 's your last warning . - Brian Friedkin . Yeah , of course it 's Friedkin . If anyone 's working for the three families , it 's him . That 's enough ! Keep them covered . We may have to end this with an unfortunate number of Category 1s . - Get him out . Take him out . - GWEN : You 're not taking him . - Back down . - No , you 're not . - Back down ! - No , you 're not . - Back down ! - OK . OK , all right , OK ? It 's all right . Well , they 've just taken Rex . - All right . - OK ? OK . I 'm fine . It 's fine . Right . Right . They 're not legitimate CIA . Done . [ REX GROANS ] All right . Go out and keep watch for the squad . Leave me alone with him . This is gonna have to be quick . - Shapiro 's arriving any minute . - Right . Right . I get it . You have to dispose of me before the rest of the CIA comes in , finds out what you 're up to . - How did you find us ? - Ten hours ago Rex made a phone call to the brother of Dr. Vera Juarez expressing his condolences . We 've been tracking his phone ever since . I knew you 'd make a mistake in the end . It 's funny , though . I never thought that sympathy would draw you out . Now all I 've gotta do is say that you attacked me and then I pulled my gun . I wonder which spot is memories or personality . Here , please feel free to piss yourself . Why 's Friedkin inside ? Who put him in the field ? Rex Matheson was his division , sir . He feels personally responsible . Yeah , well , he should have waited for me , the fat-ass . [ WHISPERS ] Doesn 't make sense . I mean , Rex ? He 'd know they 'd be tracing him . - How much did the families pay you ? - It wasn 't about the money . You can 't escape them . The families don 't just pay me . They own me . - Who did that ? - They are everywhere . - They are always . - What 's it doing ? - They are no-one . - And they are listening . - What ? - [ CHUCKLES ] Oh , Friedkin , I 'm so glad you mentioned money . That 's gonna transmit beautifully . What do you mean , transmit ? Transmit from where ? You ' re not wearing a wire , we already checked . Ha ! He stole them . Mr. Shapiro , you 've got a confession from Brian Friedkin live on air . - You 're lying . - Oh , yeah ? You should read more . Check the Torchwood file , OK ? I-5 technology transmitting from a contact lens camera ? Yeah , you see , once my heart rate hits 120 , that 's the signal to transmit the image on every frequency and on every monitor within 100 feet . You planned this . Mm . I used my phone on purpose . I was just waiting until Torchwood got enough information . But then , the Colasantos , they showed their hand , so I needed to get back inside , which meant laying a trap for you . Ahh ! It 's over , Friedkin . It 's over . And you 're no killer . MAN : Agent Friedkin , show yourself ! - Good job . - Thank you . Very good job . Mr. Shapiro , sir , tell me something ... all that time I was on the run , did you think I was a traitor ? There was evidence , woven through your records , going back ten years or more . Whoever these people are , they 're a lot smarter than Friedkin , and they 're operating on all sorts of different levels . Yeah , but now we 've got them on the run . Maybe . So ... let 's start from the beginning . Exactly what is going on ? - OK , let 's see where we are . - Er , hold on a minute , mate . Rex , look , I need to know , did you plan this whole thing from the start ? No , I just improvised when these Colasanto people appeared . - You could have warned us . - People seem to be talking over me , which is fascinating and rare . And forbidden . I 'll come back to you . First of all , we 're going to deal with this Colasanto woman . The granddaughter Olivia . Have I got that right ? Yes , and as far as I 'm aware , the CIA does not have the authority to operate on American soil . - Get her out of here . - This is my property . Take her to the safe house . Tell her to line up her lawyers , so I can piss on them long and hard . So , these are the Torchwood clowns ? Torchwood did more to piece this together than the entire CIA ! You 're that English girl , Cooper . Have I got that right ? No , I 'm not English and I 'm not a girl . Gwen , this is Allen Shapiro . - [ SOFTLY ] Don 't . Really , don 't . - Well , he 's not scaring me . Hello . I am sick of her already . Can we deport her ? Let 's deport her . - Hey , hey , hey , leave her alone . - Don 't you dare . - Don 't you dare . - Sorry , sir . With all due respect , Gwen Cooper has proven herself to be extremely useful . I think it 's worth keeping her on our side . - Did you sleep with her ? - Pardon me ? ! No , sir , I did not . Because most women that bitter , you 've slept with . Did you make that mistake ? No . No , sir , I did not . Esther Drummond . Rex said you did a good job out in the field . - Thank you , sir . - In my opinion you deserted your post . I 'm docking your pay . And what is it with you , Red Baron ? - You got Snoopy up your ass ? - [ CHUCKLES ] [ GIGGLES ] That 's funny . While you 're wasting time , Mr. Shapiro , we 've got the names of the people who are responsible for causing the miracle . I suggest we get to work . Torchwood is gonna work for the CIA ? I think the CIA can work for Torchwood , if you 're lucky . Hm . We 've got a plane ready and waiting 20 minutes away . The sooner we pool our resources , the sooner we can end this thing . - All right , let 's go . Everybody out . - What about him ? - We 've got a very sick man here . - Didn 't you read the news ? Nobody dies . There 's a nurse around here somewhere . You got two minutes . Don 't leave them alone . Jack , did we just join the CIA ? I think we did . - Hmm . - Hmm . Take that fat-ass traitor to the airport and put him in cargo . God help you . The families aren 't kind to people who let them down . - I did a lot of good . - Oh , sure . All I 'm gonna be remembered for ... is this . But there were times when I stopped them , when I said no to the families . There were so many times that I said no . I wish I could say no now . What are you doing ? It 's all about the family in the end . They said that they would get mine , unless ... - No . No , no , no ! - No , please ! What the hell was that ? MAN : What happened ? - GWEN : Oh , my God . - AGENT BAYLOR : Who was in there ? REX : Friedkin , Colasanto . I don 't know how many others . - Goddamn it . - Shit . [ MACHINE BEEPS STEADILY ] More bloodshed . All these years later , my life hasn 't changed . I can 't believe you were watching me . Maybe you said hello . Some old man asking me directions and I just ... looked right through you . Did you see him ? Did you see Ianto ? You 'd have liked him . Or maybe not . You 'd have been jealous . [ CHUCKLES ] [ SIGHS ] Gotta go . Work to do . I 'll take care of you . I promise . I could travel this whole wide world ... but where would I find another man like you ? See you later , old man . [ MACHINES BEEP FURIOUSLY ] What 's the point in that ? [ BEEPING CONTINUES ] He 's sick , I know . Tell me something new . [ MACHINES BEEP ] Shut up ! You want to tell whoever made this stuff dying 's not quite the same any more ? Oh , how do 1 ... ? [ BEEPING STOPS ] That 's better . Kinda cruel , though . Angelo ... [ CHUCKLES ] Even if your heart stops , you go on living nowadays . Like I said , I ... I gotta go . No way . That 's impossible . How the hell did you do this ? [ MONITORS RESUME BEEPING ] I 've got a man dying here ! Do you hear me ? Someone 's dying ! Jack , what 's happening ? - He 's dead . He died . - What ? Angelo died right in front of me . - Think about it , Jack . He can 't die . - Listen to me . This man 's dead . We 've got to help him . Get away from the bed . Clear the area . That 's an order . MAN : All right , come on , step back . Clear the bed . We have an emergency . Stand back . You , do what you can . This man is either dying or dead . Jack , just let the medical staff take a look at him , OK ? He can 't be dead . He just can 't be . It 's impossible . Nobody can die . - He 's just Category 1 . - I scanned him . He 's gone . REX : But is it everyone ? I mean , did the world just change back ? And if so , what happens to me ? Hmm ? I was supposed to die . You , tell Langley to go online , check the hospitals , check with everyone , cos if he 's dying , then who else is dead ? Matter of fact , just come with me . Excuse me . He 's dead ! H Ow ? Only him , no-one else . The only man in the whole wide world to die . The miracle continues , minus Mr. Colasanto . So , how did he do it ? We 've taken the body for autopsy . Any idea what we 're gonna find ? I don 't know . We should go . No , no , no , no . Nobody is leaving . This house is secure . - It 's not a crime scene . - Are you sure about that ? Dying of old age can now be considered a crime . Something happened here , and we are going to search this place for every last bit of information . And nobody is gonna leave until we know exactly what happened . So you can stay just where you are , Captain . [ DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES ] I 'm sorry . Yeah . And you really don 't know what happened to him ? What is it , Jack ? Come on , what 's wrong ? Are we in trouble ? - Yes . - We 're in trouble because he died ? Yeah . But Why ? Well , Brian Friedkin 's a Category 1 , the economy 's going into a freefall , and one man died . So , how was your day ? Welcome back , Rex . Things were kinda quiet without you . But there 's nothing else happening worldwide . Colasanto is the only death . We 're trying to keep it secret in case it starts a riot , but you 've got the only corpse on Planet Earth . Yeah , how do you think it happened ? Was it some kind of drug or something ? - What makes him so different ? - Still waiting for the results . Well , if he found a way to die then we need to find it , and quickly . Past two hours , Greece and Ireland have declared bankruptcy and Spain is going under . They 're gonna take the whole European Union down with them . OK , let 's investigate this thing from the day it began with the three families . Esther ? I 've sent you their names - Costerdane , Ablemarch , Frines . Problem is , I 've looked . There 's no-one with these last names . REX : But there has to be . They 're names . I mean , they 're names . What names aren 't names ? These names . According to every site I can think of , the names didn 't just die out . They never existed . Could be done - it 's happened before . At the end of the Second World War , all the Hitlers disappeared from the Berlin phone book . Change your name , go back and erase passport records , birth certificates . Do that for decades and you 'd be buried in the fabric of the world . There 's gotta be a paper trail . Oh , I was born for this . All right , we 've got Manhattan 1928 . Let 's check ... churches , schools , Western Union . I 'll get the full division on this . If these people bought or sold or joined anything , it 's gotta be on paper somewhere . People always miss something . All right . Noah , sidebar . I got something for you . ESTHER : Hey , remember the Vivaldi inheritance in 2004 ? Follow that same pathway , cos it worked in the end . And cross-reference it with the word " Blessing " . - Make " Blessing " a filter . - Yep . Hey , um , I 've gathered some information for you . It 's your sister . Is ... is she all right ? She 's ... OK She 's under psych observation . - In the high security wing . - Oh , my God . I went ahead and told them you work for the government to get her some extra care , you know ? Thank you . Thanks . Yeah , well , don 't tell anyone . Bad for my image . - All right ; I 'll send you the details . - Are you making a personal call ? No . Sorry , sir . Is that Mr. Shapiro ? You tell him , " Yes , it 's personal . Yes , it 's important . " And yes , his wife called . II And I sent her flowers on his behalf Charlotte Wills . Bane of my life . REX : Try hitting PhiCorp with an official disclosure . Oh , yeah , and I got one more thing for you - Oswald Danes . Yeah , we 're eyeballing him now but not under close surveillance . Why ? Harkness keeps watching him , and his instincts are good . He says that if we ' re watching Danes then the three families are watching him too . So , I want you to get someone in there , OK ? I 'm on it right now Er , it says here that Oswald sold out Cowboy Stadium . - He 's in Dallas . - He 's playing a stadium ? He 's preaching hellfire and salvation , which makes Oswald Danes the most popular man in the world right now . First , I 'm trying to set up a joint appearance for you with Madison Weakly . She 's the bisected bride . You know , car accident sheared off everything below the bikini line . Got married a week later propped up on a box . Basically , she 's made up of positive thinking and colostomy bags . Um , anyway , they were thinking you and she could share the spotlight if they could manage a two-shot , obviously . [ CLEARS THROAT ] Next , I , er , I 've got you these essays by John Maynard Keynes . You 've got interviews about fixing the economy tomorrow . Mostly just call for more deregulation and a resumption of burning .

I said , they 'll ask someone else . Please , Oswald , I 'm just trying to finish the day . Could you turn the music down ? [ MUSIC STOPS ] Get me a girl . How old ? Legal age . Seriously ?

[ BLEEPING ] [ DOOR LOCK CLUNKS ] So , my name is Shawnie Yamaguchi , and I 'm on that internship from Harrigan Knights PR , and they said that you are so busy and overworked and I figured , well , you know , learn from the best . I don 't need an intern . Thank you . I 'm sure . But ... this isn 't the latest model . And I can get you the prototype , if you want , and you really need to get 4-G . I got a contact in the store . And that is an awful lot of reading . And I am free all night . Shawnie Yamaguchi ? That is correct . Go get me a sandwich , tomato and Swiss on sourdough . Let 's see how well you cope with that . And then you can find me a prostitute . I 'm sorry ? Start with the sandwich . Certainly .

Hey , when I get back , we 'll go to the promenade together , just you and me . Would you like that ? I suppose . I know we keep talking about the miracle like it 's a bad thing , but we forget about the good side , all the years we 're gonna have ... together . That 's good , isn 't it ? They said you reported me . Who said that ? Is it true ? I had to . For your own good . I know . I get that , yeah . That 's why I know you 'll understand . - I want to volunteer . - For what ? Category 1 ... Sarah ... you can 't volunteer . Category 1 is ... it 's a medical condition . You can 't choose it . People do . Online , there 's thousands of us . This whole world 's changed , Esther . This body ... is without a soul . Don 't say that . What about the girls ? Think about the girls . I 've put them on the list too . Sometimes I wonder what keeps us from falling straight through the Earth to the other side of the world . [ sol-rm ] Oh , God . Damn it . You OK ? Fine . Time out , I think , Drummond . No , sir . Not at all . We need to find out how that man died and fix this stinking world . Thank you , sir . GWEN : I can 't tell you . I don 't trust the phones these days . And we 've got these family people everywhere . And Jack 's just as bad . Honestly , you should see him right now Rhys . He 's sulking . Why ? What 's he doing now ? Oh , don 't tell me . Did he get another bruise ? - Who 's that ? - Jack , her boss . Well , you tell her from me , I had a gun held to my head . My life was in danger , and her father 's , right inside our own house . And all because of her . So you tell her , don 't give UP ... Go get the bastards , whatever it takes . Tell her yourself . No . I 'm watching TV . - She says go get ' em . - Yeah , I heard . So , what about Jack , then ? Oh , he 's doing that old thing , keeping secrets . Won 't tell me . Will you ? Hmm ? God knows what 's going on . What time is it there ? Ah , it 's almost eight . The telly 's been on all night . They said there 's gonna be a run on the banks . Like a Lehman Brothers thing . - It 's the pensions . - Aye . The pension funds go bankrupt because of the miracle and that starts off a domino effect cos everything 's been on a knife-edge since 2008 . They said the best advice is to invest in gold . There we are , we 'll be fine . Thank God for my vast reserves , eh [ ? ] Huh ! How 's Dad ? [ WHISPERS ] She 's asking how Dad is . Tell her the truth . Not so good , Gwen . Is he conscious ? Not so much , no . The trouble is , we can 't get a doctor in cos they 'll classifiv him Category 1 . And them ovens are still sitting there . They 're only closed cos of the protests . And they said on the news if we get a recession then it 's classic isolation policy . Given our lack of resources - the camps will open up again . - Like someone planned it . Yeah . But does that include 2008 as well ? I mean , you know , was that part of the plan ? - You know a first stage ? - Could be . I think we 've been manipulated for decades . Yeah , but what for ? - I mean , where 's it all heading ? - I don 't know . It 's not like the old days with Torchwood . I mean ... [ SIGHS ] we knew what we were fighting there . But this , this is like the whole world is changing and we 're just so tiny . God , I wish you 'd come home . Not yet , sweetheart . But soon . Soon . [ SOFTLY ] OK . [ FLOORBOARD SQUEAKS ] - [ TAPS FOOT ] - What are you doing ? You seen this ? Maybe it 's the floor . What do you mean ? Well , we 're going through evidence like Angelo 's body did something . But the only strange thing with this room is the floor . I ... I knew something was bugging me . Look , the bed 's on a sort of platform . Esther , don 't . Just leave it . But look , it 's not part of the original design . It can 't be . Esther , seriously . Listen to me . Don 't say another word . Just leave it . Jack ? It 's the floor . Esther , stop , right now . [ HE CHUCKLES ] This is a hell of a lot better than nicotine gum , let me tell you . You know what the rumor is from Washington ? If cancer cells are immortal , well then , the miracle switched them around and made them plain mortal . They 're keeping it quiet in case there 's an outbreak of spontaneous joy . I mean , we can 't have that . But it means we 've got nothing to worry about . We can smoke our way into the next Great Depression . Hm ! Now ... does somebody want to tell me what 's going on between you three ? Nothing . I 'm sorry , Jack ... but we 're trying to figure out how Angelo Colasanto died . I think there 's something under the floor . OK , people , thank you very much . Leave the room immediately . Good work . Wait for my call . Captain Harkness , what is that ? No idea . Jack , tell us what it is , cos if you could hear my sister volunteering to be categorized , you would help . Look , if he says he doesn 't know , he doesn 't know , OK ? I 've read the Torchwood file . Are those materials extraterrestrial ? I said he doesn 't know . Now , get out of his face . The file also says that Cooper and Harkness inevitably form an alliance and the best results can be achieved by separating them . OK , get her out of here . And I mean it this time . Deport her . She 's no longer welcome in the United States . - Get her out of the country . - Don 't touch me . - Leave her alone . - Oh , you have something to say ? Please . No ? Well , I 'm sorry , Miss Cooper , but from this moment on , Torchwood is defunct . You will be removed from American soil immediately . And God help Great Britain . With me . Don 't cause trouble . GWEN : Jack . I 'll find you , all right ? - I 'll find you . I 'll find you , Jack . - Sir , you 've got to reconsider this . - You can 't do this . - Then talk . By all means , start talking . The CIA doesn 't have any authority over me . You 're not deporting me ! I 'm coming back ! Still got nothing to say ? Well , then , you 're not gonna mind if we dig this thing up and take it back for analysis . You can 't . I 'm sorry , OK ? You can 't touch it . Oh , he speaks at last . Jack , come on . What the hell is it ? - Some sort of transmitter . - OK , what does it do ? Well , it mostly proves my theory that immortality is caused by some kind of morphic field . Wait a minute . You know what 's causing the miracle ? No , saying it 's a morphic field is ... is as vague as saying it 's radiation . I still don 't know how , where or what is creating it . So , it transmits , what , some sort of field that cancels out the first one so Angelo could die ? - And where did he get it ? - I don 't know everything . How big is this field ? - The whole house ? - Smaller . About the size of that panel . So , we would be able to stop the miracle if we could create a field as big as , what , the whole planet ? No , you need a structure like this panel as big as the whole planet . Well , I 'm sure we 'll be able to replicate its effects . Don 't touch it , seriously . That 's a proper null field . You change the dynamic and it could nullify everything , even life . - Well , then , you need to make it safe . - I am not an expert . You 're the closest thing we 've got . Now , make it safe . And then we 're gonna take this thing back to Langley . [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] Mr. Danes . My name 's Claire . Or whatever you want it to be . Now , I did have to adopt a dress code in order to get through hotel security . You know how that is . But I have clothes in my bag if you 'd like . Schoolgirl outfit , maybe ? There won 't be any need for that . OK . Well , it 's not about the clothes , anyway . [ GIGGLES ] I can act all kinds of innocent . Whatever you want . I was very clear I don 't want that . Not at all . What do you want ? I suppose ... we could talk a little . - Would you like a drink ? - And then what ? I need to know exactly what we 're doing tonight . Maybe we could have dinner ... on room service . I 'm sorry , you mean like a date ? - [ CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY ] - [ GIGGLES ] If you want . Mr. Danes , I do know who you are . I mean , from your trial . Except that 's not everything that I am . Don 't presume to know me . I am capable of much more than my reputation . So , you wanna date me ? To begin with . Oh , my God . So , would that be , like , your first date ever ? [ GIGGLES ] I said don 't presume . We could have a drink . Maybe a fine wine , civilized people ... adult company . Actually ... no . If you don 't mind , I think I 'd like to go . But I do mind . I 'm paying . Mr. Danes , the thing is , I could cope with this if it meant shoving my face in the dirt - I 'm used to that . But if you want us to pretend that you 're normal , no way . No . - No . No , look ... - Please don 't ... - Please don 't do that . - All I 'm asking for is your company . That 's all . Just your company . Well , I think I should warn you that girls my age fight back . You know that already , though , don 't you , and that 's why - you prefer kids in the first ... - Stop ! Don 't you dare ! If you want to be a changed man , you 're running out of time . The way I heard it , you 've been classified a Category 0 . What 's Category 0 ? Oh , that day is gonna come . Category 0 is you . [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] - What 's Category 0 ? - What 's ... ? What ? Um ... What 's Category 0 , and why does my whore know about it ? Uh .. Clever girl . That 's what you get for employing someone who sleeps with senators . - She 's been listening . - Tell me , - what 's Category 0 ? - Look , Oswald , did you really think it would never come to an end , your freedom ? There 's an emergency mandate being passed through Congress defining a new Category 0 , meaning people who have ... earned themselves a place in the ovens for moral reasons . They want to burn me alive ? Oswald , you were always sentenced to death . What you had was a wonderful delay . And now it 's time for that adventure to come to an end . But ... people love me . Television loves you . It 's a different thing . They can 't kill me . - Not yet . I haven 't found them . - Haven 't found who ? How long have you known about this ? - How long have you known ? - I ... How long have you known about this ? Oswald ... [ SCREAMS ] I 'll have you arrested for this ! Brand-new charges ! [ GROANS ] They 're gonna reopen those ovens and you 're going in ! You run , Oswald ! Run as fast as you can ! You 've got the most famous face on the planet . Where are you gonna hide ? ! Where are you gonna go , Oswald ? What are you gonna do ? [ BEEPING ] Esther , can you come here for a second ? Er , and Rex . I need you to hold these pattern blocks in place . - All right , which ones ? - There . - Put your hands on the panel . - Jack , I 'm really sorry about this , but I didn 't know . Yeah , now , listen to me quickly . I 've broadened the transmission so it 's nullifying sound waves . No-one outside the field can hear us . So , make yourself look busy , just stay where you are and no-one can hear what we 're saying . What are you talking about ? They 're right there . Hey , you can hear me , right ? Hey ! Would you turn around and not look at him ? They can 't hear us ? It 's a null field . No . No way . Rex , don 't attract attention . All right . Esther , I want you to count to 100 out loud . All right ? Just keep counting . Go ahead , go . One , two , three , four , five , six , seven ... [ VOICE MUTED ] Excuse me . Sorry about that . Just check that medical record , OK ? - .. 30 , 31 , 32 ... - Holy shit . This is insane . They can still see us . Keep your heads down , facing away , like you 're concentrating , OK ? This thing 's real . How does it work ? I can 't tell you . That 's the point . Just listen to me . I knew this stuff the second I saw it . Yes , it 's alien technology . The only examples of it on Earth were in the Torchwood Hub . They were buried in the ruins . But Angelo had people watching . He must have salvaged it , knowing the miracle was coming . So what did he do ? Trigger it with your DNA or something ? Maybe that was revenge , or maybe giving me a clue . But there 's only one course of action left now . You have to get me out of here . - Are you crazy ? - Turn your head ! Jack , listen to me . The CIA is not the enemy . That 's why I brought them in . Don 't you understand ? You don 't ... [ MUTTERS ] Here we go . Be calm ... See ... Look , you don 't need to run any more , OK ? We can protect you . There 's a reason why Torchwood was secret . We kept things hidden from the human race . This technology is a science the world should never know . How can you know that ? I know , Esther , because I 've seen the future . I 've walked the future world and breathed its air . And this technology would send it to damnation . Just imagine the stealth technology of a null field hiding bombs , hiding planes , shielding one side from radiation while the other side burns . This thing would be the end of us . This timeline would be terminal . He 's right . [ SCOFFS ] Whose side are you on ? Even if the government ... Even if the government had this one panel and they put people inside and they died , it 's the same thing as the ovens . It 's control over life and death and we 've seen that that doesn 't work . But you trust me , don 't you ? Both of you ? After all we 've done ? Please , I 'm begging you , get me out of here . Look , this is the alpha plate . Without it , this is just a bunch of metal . You 've gotta get me and the plate away from this house . Jack , listen to me . We can 't , OK ? We are the CIA and this is a genuine CIA operation . This is history , Rex . This is everything . Please , get me out . [ MUTED SPEECH ] - I think you should call the police . - This is bigger than the police . I 'm organizing a press conference . I 'm gonna say that Oswald Danes is on the run - with all his old appetites - [ LIFT BELL DINGS ] It 's gonna be the biggest witch hunt this country 's ever seen . Oh ... Um ... Shawnie , can you give us a second ? This is a friend of mine ... I think . - What are you doing here ? - I 'm here to warn you . You 're being watched by a CIA field agent . Me ? Don 't be ridiculous . [ GUNSHOT ] And secondly , you 're being considered for a promotion . - You just shot her . - Does a promotion sound interesting ? - She was CIA ? - I need you to focus , Miss Kitzinger . - How would you react to a promotion ? - With PhiCorp ? Oh , we 're way above PhiCorp . Then who are you ? We 're a family business . Interested ? Yes . Well , then , that completes the interview . - And we 'd better leave . - Where are we going ? A long way away . I have her . She 's with us now . Thanks . Good news . Catholic churches love records . There 's tons of this stuff . Sorry , am I interrupting ? Oh , no , it was just a family thing , that 's all . All right , let 's get started . The whole world 's depending on us . REX : Hey , Jack , Shapiro wants to see you . Yeah . Wait a minute . You might want to grab your coat . - He 's outside by the forensics vehicle . - Thanks . - JACK : Thank you . - Yeah , just shut up . Now listen , this is the story . Jack knocked him out , held us at gunpoint and stole a car , OK ? - All right , come on . - OK . You 're not coming with me ? We can 't . That 's why we 've gotta keep our faces out of this . I 'm sorry , Jack . But the CIA has a chance of solving this thing now . And they need me and Esther - we can help . There 's a courtyard this way . All right , now listen . There 's gonna be a guard on the gate . I 'll tell him Shapiro authorized a car . Just keep your head down . - Go , go , go ! - Which one is it ? I don 't know . They 're all the same . Just chirp the thing . [ BEEPING ] - MAN : Hey , stop ! I said stop . - Go ! Just go . [ GUNSHOT ] Jack ! Stay where you are ! He saw me . Rex , he saw me . - Come on , Jack . - He saw me . Rex , he saw me . REX : I know . You can 't stay . You definitely cannot stay . Someone 's gonna have to go with him . Jack , that 's right , get in there . Come with us . - I can 't . Look after him , Esther . - My sister . I know , but someone will have heard that shot . Now go . Rex , you 've got blood ! It 's my heart , OK ? Just go It 's my heart . Go ! Go ! [ TIRES SCREECH ] RADIO : It 's morning in America , it 's morning across the Western world , and the banks are closing down . Its a disaster of almost biblical proportions . Jack , you still with me ? Some say the concept of money itself is under threat . - The euro has exacerbated ... - Jack ? - ... the financial crisis ... - Can you hear me ? Encouraging some countries to behave as recklessly as the banks themselves ... Oh , my God ... I don 't ... I don 't know where to go . Jack , please . Please say something . Oh , my God , I don 't know what to do ! Jack ... Oh , my God . I don 't know what to do . I have reason to suspect you may be illegally harboring an unsupported Category 1 deceased person . You 've been invited to Shanghai . The families want to meet you ... in person . I 'm rather jealous . They 're taking you to the Blessing . [ HE GROANS SOFTLY ] [ CREAKING ] You 're scared . Your skin 's a little too tight . There 's something just out of the corner of your eye you can 't quite see . Hmm ?

I don 't have any memories of my father . When I was small , it was just my Mom and I from the start . Besides ... Mom has always been by my side . And it was just natural that I had no father . Even though there were times that I felt sad about it . I wonder how it would be like if I had a Dad . I imagined it a lot . Really thought about it . Ah ... Sorry about that ... I just blurted out dull stuff like that . Ah ... Can I have this ? Sure . 40,000 . So it 's 1200 yen . Things I can do . Say . Hm ? This can catch attention , right ?

After the filming of this movie , I 'll be going to America with a scholarship . To train as a cameraman . You probably don 't notice his troubles but I 'll leave those to you . If you were asked not to go , what will you do ? Hm ? If she asked you not to go , what will you do ? There 's no way she 'll ask that . But what if she asked you . She 'll probably say that I should go . She 's strong if you look at her . Rather than saying " Don 't go " she 'll say " Go " while giving me a pat on the back . Gotetsu ! Come here a sec ! Hm ? About the first cut , the camera didn 't zoom in . I 'm thinking this shot with the camera would be better . Hm ? Where ? Like I said , in the first cut . First cut . It 's coming from the top . It 's coming from the top . I have no choice but to link the direct transmission data . I have no choice but to link the direct transmission data . Is that true , Hiro ! ? Even if I 'm waiting for death , I don 't want to regret anything ! Ah ! Are we going to die ? ! No way ! Aaah ! Cut ! Cut ! Cut ! Ah , wait ! Hey ! Haru ... Farewell ... Cut ! Okay ! Okay ! Sempai ! We can completely end the shoot now right ? We 're done ! Good job , everyone ! Good job ! Thank goodness ! Good job ! Good job ! Good job ! Thank you ! Thank you ! Thank you ! Don 't you dare cry . I 'm not crying ! Kazuko-san . What if ... Gotetsu-san says that he 's going far away ? Another strange question . Is that about him going to America ? Ah ... No , besides that . I want him to do his best . I want to support him in what he likes to do . That 's because I want to give him even a bit of courage . So you love him . Yup . The part where Haru says " Ah ! " was really good . That was good . What will you do next ? I 'm going to go and return the equipment . Can I go with you ? I 'm fine with it , but it 's just an equipment shop . Then , I 'll go with you . Okay . Men in the ' 70s are troublesome . So tomorrow is the publication of the notice on the newspaper . Yup . I hope he finds out . Yeah . Everyone is is probably waiting far away . That 's right . This song ... Takurou ? So this song came from this era . Hey . Hm ? Why ? Why did you help me ? Why ask all of a sudden ? No reason . Well ... If a pretty girl like me asked for a favor it 's natural not to refuse , huh ? In the future , you will become a big shot director . Marry a beautiful lady . Then have adorable kids . That 's what I think . But you know ... The you in that time , I 'll just be someone in your past , huh ? I just think ... Even though if I came from the future ... . That sounded a bit strange , huh ? I 'm going out for a bit . Ryouta ? Gotetsu ! Sorry coming out of the blue . So ? What 's up ? Can you lend me your camera ? I want to change just the last scene . What is it ? I want to shoot just this last scene in my own way , no matter what . I 'll really appreciate it . I beg you . Got it . I 'll lend you one . Thank you . No prob . There it is ! Fukamachi Kazuo . Come to the middle school 's laboratory on March 2 , Saturday . Eh ? I 'll be the one in it ? Ready ... Start ! I wonder if the cherry blossoms here are still blooming 36 years later . Yup . They 're still blooming . Only this part didn 't change . When your era comes ... Yeah . It would be nice to stand here and watch the cherry blossoms bloom here like we are now . That 's right . Though at that time , would it still be alright even if I 'm a 56 year old geezer ? Receiving ! Receiving ? Ah ... I 'm saying that I 'm accepting what we just discussed . Receiving ... Accepting ... Receiving . Receiving . Received . Ken . I want you to check on this . What 's this ? Yes . Ah ... Ah ... Ah please hold on . Ryouta ! Phone . It 's your mother . Hello ? Ah . Welcome back . Hey , did you get the film ? When will it be done ? Huh ? Ah , I just can 't wait to see it . I was wondering when it would be complete . Ryouta ? My old man collapsed . It was a stroke . It was because of overwork . The truth is , he was against me going to Tokyo . After the effects of the oil crisis it all went downhill for the factory and it became impossible to overturn the situation . I already knew that but I still didn 't go home . I set aside the struggles of my dad just because it felt natural for me to leave home . It 's not your fault that your father collapsed . Because ... he supported you , right ? Even so ... I kept on filming movies without a care . What the fuck was I doing ? Hey ... Even if it 's not right away ... Even if time passes ! You can still complete this , right ? ! Like a person from the future can understand it . Ah ! Ah ! Hot ! Hot ! Hot ! Hot ! Ouch ! Ah ! Eh ? ! So you were the one that called me ? Could it be ... You are Fukamachi Kazuo-san ? Who are you ? A ... I 'm Akari . Yoshiyama Akari . I 'm Yoshiyama Kazuko 's daughter . Yoshiyama Kazuko ? Who made the time traveling elixir ? My mother . Yoshiyama-kun made it ? Yes . So that she could meet you . But ... She got into an accident . She 's now in a hospital . That 's why ... I took her place and came here for her . What 's her condition ? I see ... That truth is ... I should have leapt to April 1972 . I made a mistake . But ... Why ? Now ... You are not a high school student . I came from the year 2698 . 2698 ? We received news that someone has leapt through time and is searching for Fukamachi Kazuo , with an elixir that should have not been developed yet before 2010 . In order to confirm that , I followed the traces of your time leap and came here . News ? Newspaper . It showed the name of missing person . My real name is ... Ken Sogoru . Ken Sogoru . But ... Until the year 2698 ... So it did reach you . Sogoru . Amazing . Ah . That 's right . So even if her memories were erased ... She still searched for me ? She said " The promise hasn 't been erased . " Please tell me . What was the promise between you and my mother ? I was in the middle of an experiment with the time leaping elixir when I came to this place . The truth is , I forgot to bring an extra elixir to go back . Until I finished making that elixir I existed in this era and lived as Fukamachi Kazuo . During that time ... I met her . She accidentally inhaled the elixir 's scent . Since then , she gained a small amount of the ability to leap through time . That scent is this lavender . And during that time , she fell in love with me ... But I had to return to the future no matter what . And I had no choice but to erase her memories of my existence . Because that is the rule . Someday will you see me again ? Yes . Not as Fukamachi Kazuo but as a completely different person . I will definitely meet the future you . Even if my memories are erased ... My heart will always remember this promise . You have finished the mission . With this , you have no choice but to go home . My mission now is to erase your memories of this and the memories of the people you met here . Please wait . There is just one person I want to meet . After I meet him , I will return to the future . I understand . I will wait until the evening . I 'll be waiting at the university laboratory where we first met . - Akari I finally delivered my Mom 's message . It would have been better if I met him too . I 'm sure you would be surprised . It 's completely not like you imagined . I will be taking the night bus tonight .

[ Notes ] Shouwa is the period of Japanese history corresponding to the reign of the Shouwa Emperor , Hirohito , from December 25 , 1926 to January 7 , 1989 . Shouwa 47 is 1972 . [ Notes ] Heisei is the the current era name in Japan . It started on January 8 , 1989 , the first day after the death of the reigning Emperor , Hirohito and where his son , Akihito , succeeded to the throne . Ryouta mistakenly read Heisei to Hirasei because of first kanji of Heisei can also be read like that . [ Notes ] Unlike in English calender where there are names in the months , Japanese calendar don 't have names in the months but rather have numbers . That 's why Akari easily got mixed up the year and month when she time leaped . [ Notes ] There are some colloquial terms used in the movie that during 1974 , the terms used by Akari are not familiar to Ryouta . Keitai / Cellphone literally means handheld in the 70s ; Otaku / Geek wasn 't a common word and easily mistaken as home or house ; Also the Gekikawa / Excessively cute / Twee dress that Akari was showing off ; And the expression ukeru / received .

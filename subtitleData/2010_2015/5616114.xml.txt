 Name tag : Previously on helix ... Explosives have been placed around the base . We draw ilaria inside and implode the entire base on top of them . Do you have any idea what you 've done by bringing this back to the base ? We can save everyone . We can get peter back . System voice : Breach . Ilaria is here . Start getting people to the cabin . Hatake : The scythe . He is the worst of us . An assassin . We can 't wait any longer . We have to blow the base . Maybe you should get on that snowmobile . Have you seen sergio ? He 's not one of us ! Do you think this is a reoccurrence of my tumor ? No , your tumor appears to be in remission . Woman : Virus and cure ? I have what you want . Your daughter , or your loyal son ? You have to make a choice . I will not ! Stop . I love you , father . Daniel ! ( explosion ) Mom ? ( speaking other language ) ( heavy punch ) Ugh ! ( speaking in other language ) ( grunts ) Do you think I haven 't been tortured before ? I 've seen more pain than you can possibly imagine . Ah ! Ah ! I have a good imagination . Now , where is she ? You tell me where she is , Or I will board up this door and this room becomes your eternity ! Do what you may . I fear you less than the people I work for . I know all about ilaria . When they find you , They will force you to watch as they kill everyone you love . Not if I find them first . You will not . You contacted your military , the fbi , Even interpol for help , but no one believed you . Ilaria is everywhere , while you hide in the shadows . ( laughs ) Go ahead . All I have is time , unlike you . Where is she , you son of a bitch ? You know , I think I finally see the family resemblance . You favor your mother over hiroshi . Tell me where she is now . She 's not much to look at these days . I mean , 30 years in a cell can take quite a brutish toll . So help me , I will kill you where you sit if you don 't start talking . Jules . A killer ? Maybe you are like your father after all . ( julia yells ) Hey , hey , hey . We will get your mother back , all right ? But not like this . She 's here , alan . She 's somewhere on this base , alive . And we 'll find her , but we can 't act like they do . He cut off my ... I know , But if we sink to their level , we 're not better than they are . I don 't want to be better , I want my mother back . ( sniffling ) I am so sorry . Would you like to be alone ? No . Why did he do it ? Sacrifice himself for me ? Because he knew that I would have made the same choice . But he grew up here with you . You hardly know me . You are my daughter . My flesh and blood . No matter how much you hate me , Nothing can change that . I don 't hate you . I just want to understand . Why didn 't you tell me my mother was still alive ? I thought ... It would only give you false hope . And put you in grave danger . I didn 't want to fail you ... As I failed her . How did you fail her ? By allowing ilaria to take her , To use her against me . That 's why you created the narvik for ilaria ? To keep her alive ? I had no other choice . You were protecting me too . That 's why you never revealed yourself . ( sighs ) They would have hunted you to the ends of the earth . As they now will . ( theme music playing ) That 's the missing snowmobile ! It 's been snowing for four hours , there 's no tracks . Sergio has to be somewhere . Look around you . " somewhere " is a pretty big place . He 's not gonna last the day out here . I thought he was supposed to be some bad-ass special-ops type . He 's from brazil ! We need to face reality . He might already be dead . No . I won 't accept that ! We gotta keep looking . The others are waiting . If we keep looking , Then we might die out here with them ! ( panting ) Just 10 more steps . Ten more steps . ( breathing hard ) Ten more steps . Sarah : I know that there 's been a lot of uncertainty , But I want you all to know that you are perfectly safe down here . I 'll only be gone an hour . Dr. Jordan . You 're the one keeping us from losing our heads . If you leave , it will start a panic . They can panic all they want . I really have to find alan right now . He told us to stay down here . No , alan needs to know that daniel took the canisters ... You have the cure . What does that matter ? He took both canisters , the virus and the cure . I don 't have to explain to you what that means if it gets out . ( clears throat ) What 's wrong ? Are you sick ? No , I 'm fine . You 're white as a ghost . With everything that 's happened , You need a blood test . Since when are you concerned about my wellbeing ? I 'm truly sorry about what happened before . I panicked . Let me make it up to you . My lab is just upstairs . The test will only take a moment . Hey , back for another go-around ? Beating on a helpless boy ? Alan : You 're not helpless . You 're not a boy , from what I hear . Hmm . Hiroshi 's been telling tall tales . I 'll have to remedy that once I 'm back at ilaria . Who says you 're going back ? Maybe we send little pieces of you . That 's enough . Why ? After what he did to julia ? Torture gets us nowhere . All right ? ( spencer laughing ) I mean , what is this ? Good scientist , bad scientist ? Here 's how this will work . You will contact your cohort And arrange to have julia 's mother returned to us . And only then will we let you go . Total surrender ? Yeah , see , that is quite tempting , But let me give you the full view . You 've already lost . We have the virus , and we have the cure . Oh , do you , now ? Have you not seen the news ? What news ? The download 's a couple days old , but have at it . What are we looking at ? Well , my spanish is rusty , But it seems there 's been an outbreak of an unknown viral illness In lares , puerto rico . Jesus . Hundreds sick , an untold number dead . And they 're calling it " sangre negra . " " black blood . " It looks like narvik , but how the hell did it get off the base ? Balleseros . ( grunts ) ( snow mobile whirring ) This is the turnoff to nunavut . I know where we are , tulok . Then you know we gotta get moving . We can 't spend the night out here . He 's alive . I know it . Tulok : He 's only one man . Ilaria will hunt us all down . ( scoffs ) Tulok , you know why our ancestors built the inuksuk ? As a marker to show us our way . But also to remind us that we 're never alone in such a lonely place . Yeah , that , and we needed a stop sign . Well , how am I supposed to just leave him out here ? He made his choice . You need to honor that . ( engine starting ) Oh ! ( balleseros groaning ) Hello , sergio . Blake . What an unpleasant surprise . Likewise . Imagine my dismay when you popped up on the base perimeter cam . You saved me ? Against my better judgment , but yes . Although I was tempted to leave you out alone and forsaken Just so you 'd know how it felt . I meant to call you . Spare me . The only reason you 're here is because I could use the backup . I thought the scythe only worked on the down-low . He 's indisposed at the moment , Courtesy of hatake and your friends from the cdc . He 's a prisoner ? He 's exactly where he wants to be . Virus and cure . You 've got the narvik virus and cure right here ? The only thing left to do is close out . ( static crackling ) The camera 's offline . That ought to keep them from listening in . This is unspeakable . Are you sure it wasn 't an accident ? No , it was a test run . Lares is isolated . It 's the perfect sample size to see how the virus behaves in a given population . There are no reports of vectors , So it might be narvik a . I know a little bit about this , okay ? Peter 's right . Which means we can contain it . But only if we are able to retrieve the cure . And my mother . Yes , along with jane . Well , we know they 're watching us . Where 's the best place to hack into the camera ? The security room on level g . They must have set up a base of operations . There is only one entrance . If we access the subfloor , I might be able to recalibrate the air filtration system And flood the room with cs gas . Or we could use our chips to gain access and go in armed . I like that idea . I 'm in . No , no . We need somebody to watch after the teenager . Great . Babysitting duty . Many have taken spencer lightly . Few have lived to talk about it . Of course . Whatever is needed . Look , they 're bringing the party to us . Ready ? Just like old times . Ugh ! Balleseros . What are you doing here ? I had some unfinished business to attend to . Alan : Uh , uh , uh . Balleseros , I need those canisters . And you 'll get them , as soon as I get what I came for . Major balleseros , why don 't you put down the gun ? Yeah , I think I 'll hang on to it . I just want what 's inside the crate . The old woman ? Why ? She 's julia 's mother . Your mother ? Just let me make sure she 's all right . Go . ( beeping ) I always knew you were capable of murder , but mass murder ? What are you talking about ? You 're telling me you know nothing about the outbreak in puerto rico ? Narvik a . You don 't know about that ? Of course he does . He 's the one smuggled it off the base . Whatever you think I have done has nothing to do with the reason I am here . I only want the list . What list ? Hatake knows which one . The inuit children . You 're a dead man , sergio . Shut up , blake . You two know each other . Why does that not surprise me ? You 're dead but you just don 't know it . Shut . Up . I 'm not going to tell you again . What are you gonna do , shoot me ? ( gunshot ) I don 't work for them ! You get it ? Now ... The list . I appreciate everything you 're doing , But we should really get back downstairs . This will only take a moment . We 'll get to the bottom of what 's ailing you . You know , I can take care of the rest myself . Nonsense . This is my bailiwick , anyways . Your bailiwick ? I 'm a hematologist . Didn 't I mention that ? My specialty is rare blood diseases , Although you rarely get anything exotic all the way up here . Dr. Haven , I don 't think ... Bloody hell . I 'm seeing severely elevated levels of beta-hcg . I don 't mean to alarm you , But levels this high could sometimes be indicators Of certain types of cancer . Have you ? Thirty-one inuit children over the past 20 years abducted , Experimented on like lab rats , and then put up for adoption . I want the list with their locations . Why would you assume such a list exists ? A lot of people seem to think it does , including your son . Is that true ? Did you take children ? Many sacrifices were made in the pursuit of science . I am not proud . But surely you , Of all people , can understand that . I know all about sacrifices . I 've sacrificed nearly every relationship I ever had to science . But human experimentation ? On children , no less ? I 'm not that man anymore . Then prove it . Give me the list , And I give you the canisters . There is no list . I 'm sorry . That is bullshit . No written list . The information you seek is here . Those children are never far from my thoughts . I remember every one of them And where they were placed . Shall we begin ? ( panting ) Jane , can you hear me ? No . No more , please . It 's okay . They can 't hurt you anymore . Who are you ? My name is julia . Jul ... I have a daughter named julia . I know . She 's just a little girl . You have to let me go . I 'm supposed to take care of her . Shh , it 's okay . I 'm gonna take care of you right now . It 's okay . Alan . Virus and cure . They 're yours now . ( door hisses open ) Dr. Farragut . I was beginning to feel neglected . Not a feeling you 're used to , I 'm sure . You know very little about me , But I know a great deal about you . Second son to a second son , Destined for mediocrity while your handsome brother Scooped up all the accolades ... Not to mention julia walker . You don 't know me . No , but I do understand you , More than you can imagine . And I see you 're tired from chasing someone else 's dreams . That is not what this is about . Of course it is . You 've made a career out of following in alan 's footsteps ... Stop it . Wishing that once , just once , You could finish higher than second place . I said stop ! Go on , then . Get it over with . You have no idea what you 've put me through . All for good cause . Smuggling the virus off the base was a master stroke . Yeah , and it almost got me killed , Transformed into one of those ... Things . You 've been loyal to us for many years , And it has not gone unnoticed . Together , you and I will shape the future of the world . To the future . To the future . Now , this might sting a bit . How is she ? Stable . They have her hopped up on all kinds of heavy-duty tranquilizers . She say anything ? She still remembers me as a little girl . You know , I dreamed of this moment , Wished I could talk to her just once . And now ... It may take time , jules . Who knows what condition she 's been kept in the last 30 years ? Tortured . The mind can shut down to protect itself . My mind is fine . My body , on the other hand ... How are you feeling ? Like a house fell on me . Where am I ? Arctic biosystems . ( gasps ) I never thought I 'd hear that name again . You remember this place ? I practically lived here for six years . Me and ... Your daughter . Jules . ( whispers ) and that 's you , right ? You 're even more beautiful than I imagined . You must have so many questions . Yeah , that 's an understatement . I wish I would 've had the courage to take you away from here sooner . I wish ... So many things . Why did you stay ? And you built that cabin . I loved your father very much . I wanted to keep our family together . I thought I hoped . Hiroshi would change . But he was too ambitious . And I was a fool . I 'm ... So sorry , jules . There wasn 't a day that went by that I didn 't think of you . Me , too . Who 's that handsome fella ? Jane walker , dr . Alan farragut . It 's an honor to meet you , ma 'am . Polite , too . He 's a keeper . Uh , we were married . Married ? Guess I have missed a lot . ( door opens ) Hiroshi ? Hello , jane . Look at you . You 're exactly the same . Not exactly . I am older In spite of how I look . And how is that fair ? System voice : Perimeter breach . Perimeter breach . Perimeter breach . What 's happening ? Is it ilaria ? I don 't think so . Julia : Then who ? System voice : Perimeter breach . Perimeter breach . ( snowmobile starting ) Hey , I heard the alarm . Is everyone okay ? We 're about to find out . I thought you were going down to the cabin . ( door buzzing ) System voice : Level e . Daniel ? Miksa . I 'm his brother . And you must be the child thief ! Tulok , no ! We came to help these people . Help how ? Sergio says you don 't have enough snowmobiles to evacuate . Now you do . Where 's miksa ? ( door hisses open ) Peter ! What happened ? The scythe . He must 've got a hand free . And the next thing I know , I was waking up . Where is he ? I 'm sorry , alan . I screwed up big time . All the scientists , up to the loading ramp . Now ! Spencer will never allow us to leave the base before ilaria arrives . We have to try . Then we are doomed to fail . I don 't believe that . He 's not infallible , no one is . Every living thing has a weakness every virus , every human being . We have to try . There has to be a way ! There is one way . Hatake : His only weakness . Woman : Can you help me carry this over , please ? Woman 2 : Yep , here you go . Woman 3 : How many kids do we have ? Man : Get me some rope . Alan : Hey . What are you doing ? Entrusting you with the fate of the world . Oh , is that all ? No matter what happens , you have to get these canisters to barrow , To barrow , and then on a flight to lares , puerto rico . We 'll take them there together . I hope you 're right . Because if we fail ... We won 't . ( indistinct conversation ) Man : Keep it coming . Alan ... Be careful . Dr. Jordan . I 've been looking for you . Sorry , I 'm kind of busy . Don 't you want to hear about your test results ? Look , dr . Haven , I had a spinal tumor , And now I don 't , so if you 're gonna tell me that the cancer is back ... Cancer ? My dear girl , you 're pregnant . I 'm what ? You 'll need a more reliable test back home , but ... Congratulations . Alan : Come on ! Everyone stick together until we get to the snowmobiles . Man : Okay , then , we 're almost done . Let 's keep going . Woman : As fast as you can . Man : Keep it up . No ! Everyone , out ! ( explosion ) ( grunts ) Jules ! Jules ! Alan ! Don 't hurt her ! Why would I ? I have everything I need right here . The virus , cure , and hatake 's spawn . It seems puerto rico wasn 't necessary after all . You murdered hundreds of people ! As your people have done for centuries , With your witch trials and inquisitions ! You know that 's not the truth , spencer . Don 't call me that . Those are lies propagated by your mother and father . Let my daughter go . You can take me back with you ... No , no ! Jane ! Stop ! Please ! Don 't ! Let her go , spencer . Don 't call me that ! ( blade slicing ) jane ! ( helicopter flying overhead ) Jane . ( grunting with effort ) Mother ! ( mouths ) find me . ( french song playing ) You found julia ? Yeah . Is she ... Alive ? I think so . ( sighs ) thank god . How did you find her ? You don 't want to know . You know what to do . If I 'm not at the checkpoint , Push on without me . ( door opens ) ( speaking in french )

 Come in , anyone . Anybody out there ? We 're sick . I 'm broadcasting in the blind . Mama ? Mama ? - In the blind ! - Mama , please don 't fall asleep . Mama , we 're gonna get you help . - Wake up , Mama , please ! - Anyone , come in , please . Anyone out there ? Anyone , damn it ! Mama , please don 't fall asleep . Wake up , Mama . Mama ! What 's your name ? Ripped By mstoll You sure you have enough for the whole crew ? And 50 or 60 more . When we get home , we can use this as a vaccine and a cure ? Well , the uninfected will be immunized and the sick can be cured providing they 're not too far gone . After all the failures and the false starts I just feel so- - Happy ? I can 't remember the last time that I felt that emotion . Still so much to do . We have to mass-produce it we have to distribute it . My God . - Rachel . You did it . Let 's enjoy the moment . I told her how I feel . I mean , basically , I spilled my guts to her . I mean , sure , I 'm spiking a hundred-and-four-degree fever but still , you know . " You make me wanna love again . " I actually said that . And what does she give me ? Zip . What I understand about women , you 'd fit in a shot glass . I don 't need to tell you . Hey , how are you feeling ? I don 't get seasick , so ... I 've never seen morning sickness on a DDG before . Have you seen a nursery ? No . Form up . Okay , here 's the deal . We 're attempting to make contact with the infectious disease lab at Fort Detrick as it is just the facility Dr. Scott requires for mass-producing the cure . So far we 've had no joy . I 'll be honest knowing how deadly this plague is and how fast it spreads I don 't have any confidence that there 's gonna be any survivors , so ... That being said , there 's a reason they call it a fort . And if anyone can hold their own it 's our friends in the U.S. Army . - Master chief . - Thank you , sir . I wanna address the issue that 's on all of our minds . On our way up the coast , our ship will be passing right by Norfolk . By home . Our comms team tells us we could pick up some orphan signals from random cell towers or servers still online . You may even get a phone call if they 've restored power on land . It 's unlikely , but I just wanna prepare you . We don 't know what to expect when we get back to the States . Only way to help the people we love is to deliver Dr. Scott and the cure to a secure and workable lab . Detrick 's our best bet , so that 's our mission . - Aye , sir . - Carry on . Any station in vicinity of Fort Detrick USAMRIID , this is U.S.S. Nathan James , over . Aye , sir . Captain , SSES reports that the keyhole satellite will be flying over our whiskey in 50 seconds . Unable to steer but they did manage to break the uplink encryption . Bringing up the feed now . - It 's traveling fast . - Too fast , sir . There 's no one left to control it . When it gets over the area , we 'll have a minute to capture the images . We 'll just need enough to chart a route from the land to the lab . We 've tapped into one of the Air Force 's spy satellites to check the traffic to Fort Detrick . Well , why not send your helicopter or drone ? No more fuel . They spent it all looking for me . - Satellite passing over us . - This is U.S.S. Nathan James , over . - Any station in this net ... - Come on , give us something . - This is U.S.S. Nathan James . Over . - There it is . Home . - That 's Interstate 70 . - If clear , it 'll get us all the way to Detrick . There 'll be some image blur , but I 'll get you closer , sir . That 's a mass evacuation . - Take us north a mile . - Aye , sir . Any station in this vicinity of Fort Detrick USAMRIID , this is U.S.S. Nathan James . That red X , some sort of quarantine ? More like a warning sign to stay away . Looks like people took it seriously . Sir , the satellite 's approaching Fort Detrick . I say again , anyone at Fort Detrick , please respond . The laboratory building 's in the center of campus . Roger that , ma 'am . Zooming in . Oh , my God . It 's been completely destroyed . The lab , the containment areas the equipment , everything . Nothing else on the base was burned . That lab was targeted . Who would 've done that ? Slow down . Slow down . Stop the car . - Where you going ? - My family 's sick . They need help . - You can 't go this way . Turn around . - Please . - Please , we 're trying to get to Olympia . - Olympia can 't help you . Go back where you came from , old man . Get down . Should we go after them ? No . They 'll be dead soon . Sir ! Sir ! Take a breath . What is it ? I caught a new broadcast . It 's another loop , but this one was updated today . And there 's something you need to hear . Winds are coming southwest and temperatures will reach 50 degrees in Baltimore . How come we 're hearing this now ? A weak FM transmitter . It must 've just come into range . There are reports of an outbreak of the Red Flu ... Red Flu. ls that what they 're calling it ? - Doesn 't do it justice , somehow . - It 's looping around . Here it comes . Nathan James , we are aware of your mission and we have secured the facility you require . If you are within range of the signal , we urge you to reply over channel 1-6 . I repeat , U.S.S. Nathan James if you are still out there , please reply on VHF channel 1-6 . - Get them on the line . - Yes , sir . This is U.S. Naval warship Nathan James hailing you on channel 1-6 . We have heard your call , over . This is U.S. Naval warship Nathan James hailing you on channel 1-6 . We have heard your call , over . Baltimore . We 'll set a course in that direction . Agreed . We may still be too far out . Then let me know as soon as you find out . Good work , son . Schools have reopened in Sector 3 and some city services are set to resume . Attention , attention . This call goes out to the crew of the USS . Nathan James . We are aware of your mission and we have secured the facility you may require . If you are in range of the signal we urge you to reply over channel 1-6 . I repeat , USS . Nathan James , if you are still out there ... - Jed ? - Did you hear that , Darien ? Tom 's still out there and people are waiting for him . Don 't worry , sweetheart . You 're gonna make it . You hang in there . I had to do what was best- - Best for who ? - Please listen . - How could that ... Ava ? - Quincy , we have been through it . - This is not fair . - They 're at it again . - Tell me what this is . You know that I love you . Events , just , they keep happening and have a mind of their own ... I know that things are better now but I don 't think they 'll be the same again . - Hello , Kelly . - Hi . - Ava , darling , shall we find something to eat ? - All right . - I 'll see you later . - I 'll see you later . Bye . She can 't forgive me for what I put them through . And to be honest , I don 't blame her . Well , when the captain finds the right place for us to put ashore maybe you can all start again on more solid ground . Captain , I 've got Baltimore . - A Mrs. Granderson is on the line . - Did you say Granderson ? - Yes , sir . - Well , put her through . They 're trying to use the VIDCOM , but can only get audio , sir . - Go ahead , sir . - This is Tom Chandler ... Captain Chandler . You have no idea how good it is to hear your voice . We thought you were lost at sea . No , ma 'am , we 're alive and well . Oh , there you are . - I got it . - You must be nearby . I 'm Amy Granderson and I suppose an explanation is in order . As vice-chair of the President 's Defense Policy Board I was briefed on your mission to the Arctic . I knew the risks of the coming pandemic and I had my daughter transferred to your ship . You must forgive me . No apology needed , ma 'am . Your daughter 's been an incredible asset . I 'm pleased to hear from you . We had no word from the presidential bunker . President Geller invited me underground . I declined . I thought the risk was too big to have so much of our civilian and military command in one confined space . Unfortunately , I was right . So the government is gone ? For the most part , yes . Since the bunker went silent there has been a breakdown in infrastructure general panic , and , of course , a tremendous loss of life . I have tried to execute a contingency plan working with the state and local police to create safe zones . We have been hanging on as best we can . And I have been praying every day for your return . Ma 'am , we can be in Baltimore in a matter of hours . In the meantime , I 'm sure there is someone you 'd like to speak with . Mom ? Alisha . Mom , I don 't- - I don 't understand . What are you doing ? Where are you ? I 'm here , darling . Oh , I knew you were out there . I just knew it . Thorwald . We 've intercepted a transmission . A U.S. Navy ship is due to make port in a matter of hours in Baltimore Harbor . - What kind of ship ? - I don 't know , sir . Well , is it a tug ? A destroyer ? A 5000-sailor aircraft carrier ? The signal was spotty . All we know is the name . Nathan James . It 's the ship they 've been hailing for weeks . Granderson 's sending out a greeting party . Well , if they 're having a party then let 's party . We cleared Baltimore , port distance 1000 yards . No threats , no contacts . All commands reporting forced rigging . VBSS on the way to designated meeting point . E-W reports negative rackets of interest . Nothing moving on surface plot . Clean picture . Bridge , CIC . ATTWO reports SCAT team manned and ready at all crew-served weapon stations port and starboard . All right , let 's move . Fan out . - Aye , sir . - Secure perimeter . Dennis and Rowler , left flank . Cruz , we take right . Keep your heads on a swivel , fellas . Perimeter secure . - Keep eyes on upper structures . - Copy . Here they come . Contact the front . Hi . Hey . I 'm Lieutenant Pete Norris of the Maryland State Police . Inside my vehicles are my assistant barrack commander my criminal section supervisor , and a few surviving state troopers . You don 't need the masks . We 're not sick . I 'm Lieutenant Green , this is Lieutenant Burk . It 's a pleasure to make your acquaintance , lieutenant . Bridge , Burk . The pier is secure . All clear , over . Understand . All clear on the beach . Landing party underway . - Welcome to Baltimore . - It 's great to be here . Looks like the troopers just got a couple hundred U.S. sailors . A few dozen Tomahawks too . Second landing party arriving . Including the captain . You must be Lieutenant Norris . Tom Chandler , CO , Nathan James . Pleasure to meet you . This is Lieutenant Landau . - Ma 'am . - Sir . Hey . How y 'all doing ? Just fine , now that you 're here . We can escort you guys back to our HQ . Here comes another van . Cobra 1 in place . All clear on the beach . - Holy shit . - What ? Mom ? I had to come see for myself . Oh , my baby girl . It 's her . It 's Granderson . She came out herself . I am so glad to have you back . Captain Chandler , thank you . Thank you for returning my daughter to me . Privilege . We wouldn 't be here without her . Take the shot . Mrs. Granderson , we really need to get you back in the vehicle . She 's blocked . Come . Everyone 's eager to meet you . I can take out the fat man . No . You only have one shot . I want her . Nathan James , we 're having a family reunion here . We 're headed out with the group . Sending Lieutenant Norris back with the VBSS to update you with the situation on ground , sir . Roger that . We 'll arrange a welcome for Lieutenant Norris . Oh , and say hi to Mom for us . Damn it . I lost her . Talk to your friends on the inside . Find out what they 're doing here . We were fortunate to find this building . There 's only one coal-fired plant still operational and we have a direct line . Plus , strategically , we 're far enough from the city to avoid infection . You 'll be safe here . Come . Mom , this is amazing . - Yes , but it 's been a battle . - And who 's the enemy ? Warlords , they call themselves . And recently , they 've killed more people than the actual virus . Do you know they raided the National Archives ? They actually tried to steal original copies of the Constitution . As if that could take away who we are as a people . Captain . I didn 't wanna broadcast about the virus over an open radio feed but the president told me that you had the materials to produce a vaccine . Is that true ? Yes , ma 'am . We 've actually made a little more progress than that , Mrs. Granderson . We have the cure . Fort Detrick was our first option too . They had the lab and all , but Thorvvald got there first . - Thorvvald ? - A former Baltimore P.D turned self-proclaimed leader of the warlords . Been a real pain in our ass since this whole thing started . I shouldn 't complain . I imagine you 've been through a hell of a time yourselves . Listen , lieutenant , last I talked to my wife she was taking the family to Deer Park . - Safe zone , heard of it . You know if it 's still there ? There was fighting , but there are survivors . I can get you there as soon as we get you off the ship . Thanks , doc . You have no idea how good that felt . - Oh , I have some idea . - Yeah . What were the results of Test 37 ? See , these results are consistent ... Now , this is the main reason we chose this building . We 've worked for months trying to develop a cure but now you 're here . It 's heavenly . You 're not gonna like this , boss . My guy inside Granderson 's said the ship came back with a cure . It could be bullshit . We 've heard this before . Not from the U.S. Navy . If that 's true , Granderson will spread out . Go anywhere she wants . We will lose the city . We need to get our hands on the cure . It 's probably locked away somewhere on the ship . The only way is to take Granderson on directly . We have to take her lab . Extraordinary . Look at her . She 's in love with a toaster . - You still haven 't made your move ? - I 've been making my move since Gitmo . She ain 't buying what I 'm selling . I thought once she saved the world , she 'd let loose a little . Nathan James , this is Vulture 1 . DO you copy ? This is her letting loose . I repeat , Nathan James , this is Vulture 1 . Do you copy ? - I can 't get through , sir . - You won 't get a signal . Warlords are jamming local frequencies . They have a radio room , sir . I let the XO know where we are . Ma 'am , if that radio room 's still available I 'd like to get word to my family , see if they 're out there . I think it 's time you thought of yourself . Meanwhile , we can work with your team to arrange safe transit here for your ship 's crew . This is Tom Chandler listening on a spread spectrum , looking for Jed Chandler in Clearwater , Virginia or parts nearby . Over . This is Tom Chandler listening on a spread spectrum looking for Jed Chandler in Clearwater , Virginia or parts nearby . Over . - -And some city services are set to resume . This is Tom Chandler looking for Jed Chandler in Clearwater , Virginia . Over . This is Tom Chandler looking for Jed Chandler in Clearwater , Virginia . Over . Howdy . Tex . Hey , listen , just wanted to let you know that I 'm heading off . Heading off ? What are you talking about ? I 'm moving on . By yourself ? But it 's chaos out there . I 've seen worse . And thanks to you , I can travel wherever I like . Where will you go ? I got things to take care of . The young girl whose picture that you keep in your locket . Among other things , yeah . Anyway , you seem to have things plenty well in hand here . Right , then . Uh , you 're a special woman , you know that ? You take care , now . What the hell . This is Tom Chandler looking for Jed Chandler in Clearwater , Virginia . Over . This is Tom Chandler , U.S. Navy , looking for Jed Chandler in Clearwater , Virginia . Over . - Tom ? - Dad ? Dad ? Are you there ? It 's me . It 's Tom . I 'm back . - Tom . - I 'm here , Dad . Tommy ? Are you at the cabin ? - We ' re going to Baltimore . - Baltimore ? - Are you with the kids ? Darien ? - We 're sick . We had to leave the cabin . Going to Olympia . It 's our only hope for a cure . Please , Tom , come quick . We 're sick . Tell me exactly where you are . What do you see ? - Onik 's Truck Stop . - Truck stop ? - What happened ? Are you on the road ? - Onik Truck Stop . - It 's a tire shop downtown . - We can get you there . Listen to me . Stay put . I 'm coming for you . Put these jackets on . You 'll blend in better . We 're in and out , gentlemen . Dad ? - Dad ? - Let 's get eyes 360 . - Darien ? - Sir . Dad ? Darien ? Where did you get this radio ? - Where did you get this radio ? Answer me ! - It 's mine now . The man you took this radio from , where 'd he go ? - Where did he go ? Where ? - The arena . - What arena ? - Olympia . Olympia . Come on . Let 's go . - Can 't do that , sir . - What do you mean ? - Olympia 's for sick people . - But we 're immune . - You got the shots too . - Get back in the car . We 're going back to base . - We 're going to Olympia . - You don 't give the orders , captain . - Drop your weapon ! - Don 't wanna do this . We 're on the same side . Everybody calm down . Master chief ! I 'm all right . I 'm okay . Nathan James , this is Vulture 2 . Come in . Damn it . Still can 't get through . Take the truck , get the master chief back to the ship . - Tell the XO what 's going on . - What is going on ? Find a way to get the others back to the ship . We 're getting out of Baltimore . You Okay ? What about us ? We 're going to Olympia . You 'll inform the others , then ? Very good . Everything okay ? Yeah . All good . Everything 's under control . I wanna try and look for Sarah . If you survived , there 's a chance ... - ... that maybe she 's still okay . - Alisha . Your friend lived in Wisconsin . There 's no way to get there now . - Soon , maybe . - But if we make- - Soon . Now tell me this . What kind of man is Captain Chandler ? He 's amazing . Without him , we wouldn 't have gotten through any of this . So he hasn 't let the power go to his head ? I 'm not sure I understand the question . I 'm asking if he will still follow orders . Follow orders from whom ? Mother , what 's going on ? Michael . Have you seen these protocols ? Of course . Why ? Well , Dr. Hamada claims that his treatment prolongs the lives of the infected . But his whole assumption about the virus seems to be wrong . Heh . I 'm a statistician . The data he 's given suggests treatment 's working . - No , impossible . - Is something wrong ? Dr. Hamada . You 're using Ribavirin to introduce higher error rates to the virus ' DNA replication . - In a chemical cocktail , yes . - The pandemic virus is error-free . Your treatment wouldn 't have any positive effect whatsoever . In fact , these dose levels are highly toxic . Uh ... Enter quietly and follow instructions once inside . You will be told which section to wait for treatment . You will receive medication in sequence of arrival . Left through the turnstile and wait for assessment . Do not mass in front of doors . Enter quietly and follow instructions once inside . You will be told which section to wait for treatment . You will receive medication in sequence of arrival . Daddy ? Daddy ? - Daddy . - Ashley . - Daddy . Daddy . - Ashley . Oh , my God . - Sammy . - Daddy . - Daddy , we 're sick . - I know , baby . I know . Daddy 's gonna make it better , okay ? Where 's Mommy ? - Tommy . - Where 's your mother ? - Tommy . - Dad , why didn 't you wait for me ? Sam , a little pinch . A little pinch . This is gonna make you feel better . - Tommy . - Where is she ? I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Dad , where 's Darien ? She 's gone , son . She 's gone . I tried to do everything I could to save her . - I tried to . I tried to . - I know you did , Pop . I know you did . But right now I gotta give you this . Stack the cases by the door . We 'll put them on a pallet . Unload them dockside as we make port . I 'm not sure exactly when that 's gonna be- - Hey , Norris . - Answer a question for us if you could . - Yes , sir . - Commander . Commander . - Whoa ! Get on the horn , and give the order to drop anchor . You muster your entire crew on the flight deck . Open up the door to the helo bay ... - ... where you 're storing the cure . - I 'm not giving you a thing . - I don 't know your plan- - - You do exactly what I say . Or I 'll pick off your crew one-by-one . My troopers are everywhere . This ship is mine now . Please , he needs help . - Call Doc Rios . - Nobody moves . - Nobody move . - Put down that weapon . - You don 't think I 'll do it ? - Put down that weapon . You think I won 't do it , XO ? Just try me . I 'm not gonna tell you again , commander . Muster your crew . Doctor . My troopers say they experienced no side effects from the cure . It 's amazing what you 've created . I wish I could say the same in return . I understand you have some questions about the way we 've been treating the sick . What you are giving the sick is anything but a treatment . - Of that , I am sure . - Doctor . You know this . In the 14th century the Black Death wiped out 60 percent of the European population . The plague killed indiscriminately . The artists , scientists thinkers so few and precious to begin with , were wiped out . It upended the social order and prolonged the Dark Ages a hundred and fifty years . I cannot let that happen here . I understand your allegiance to your friends . You 've gone through so much together but you 've seen nothing of the chaos here at home . The hysteria . The cruelty . The savagery . You must try to see the situation from our point of view . There are people out there who would use this crisis to take what does not belong to them . They are the barbarians at the gate who want to send us into a new Dark Age . We have the power to stop them . To keep them in their place . It is my duty to help the right people first . The people whose survival will ensure the future of our entire society and all that we hold dear . So you gathered your elite few within these walls . And the rest what happens to them ? The virus doesn 't discriminate . That unfortunate task falls to me . Please . Hey , what are you doing ? You can 't be here . - You 're killing them . - Get the hell back behind the curtain . - You 're killing them . - Stay back . You sick bastards . Captain , we gotta move . Security breach in Section 12 . Repeat , security breach in Section 12 . I don 't get it . They 're burning them . They 're burning the bodies to power the city . I know it 's hard to understand . You 've been away so long . But in time , Rachel , you 'll see it 's the only way . - She was trying to run . - Dr. Scott , I had no idea this was happening . - I swear it- - - Hush , dear . You can 't replicate my work with the doses that I 've given you . Everything that you need is locked up on that ship . And the captain will never give it up . You let me worry about the captain . Daddy . We have to go . Nathan James , come in . Do you read me ? Nathan James , come in . DO you read me ? Nathan James , this is the captain . Come in . Do you read me ? Nathan James , come in . Do you read me ? Nathan James , this is the captain . Come in . Do you read me ? Nathan James , where are you ? Ripped By mstoll

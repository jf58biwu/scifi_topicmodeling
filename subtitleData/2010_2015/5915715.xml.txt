 Coulson : Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... You did well . Pick it up . I hear you 've been looking for this . And only someone who can carry the Diviner - is allowed to enter the city . - Or more importantly , the temple inside . Mr. Ward here is something of an expert on S.H.I.E.L.D. , and you an expert on the Diviner . Together , I think there 's much we can achieve . You know you 've lied to me . This happens every time ... we get closer , you get nervous . Everything we 've been doing leads here . Our job ... find it before anyone else . Skye : If there 's evidence of this city on Earth , the computer will find it . [ computer dings , beeping ] 2x09 - ... Ye Who Enter Here Skye : [ breathing heavily ] Hello ? ! Coulson ! [ baby crying ] [ rumbling ] Coulson ! [ breathing heavily ] Where 'd everybody go ? ! Where 'd everybody go ? Coulson ! [ rumbling ] [ calliope playing in distance ] That sound ... What is that ? [ disembodied whispering ] Coulson . What are you doing ? We have a mission to prep for . This is the mission . It opens . So weird , right ? N-No ! [ calliope music plays ] [ baby fussing ] Sacrifices have to be made . - Poison tree , poison fruit . - I know . Bye-bye , angel eyes . [ baby crying ] No . Wait . Wait ! Don 't leave her ! Coulson . May ! Wait ! - Coulson ! - Coulson : Skye , wake up . [ gasps ] Sorry I startled you . You okay ? Hi . Yeah . [ clears throat ] I just dozed off . Grab your things . We 're back . - Mack : Look out ! - There we go . [ chuckles ] Coming through , coming through . Watch out , watch out . Coming through , coming through . [ Mack chuckles ] Hey , hey , take it easy with that . - I made that for Coulson . - Wow . Hey , you know , if you 're looking for vacation time , bribery will get you nowhere , 'cause I 've tried . No , I 'm hoping he 'll let me work on the real thing . Brilliant . [ Morse laughing ] And so how do you get it to fly ? - It doesn 't . - Aww . [ giggling ] What ? Something wrong ? Storm 's coming . No , weather 's fine , actually . There 's not a cloud in the sky . - I checked . - No , never mind . Were you looking for me ? Yeah . Actually , um , the ... Actually , I need to go to the plane . What , you need help with the holographic towers ? - No , no , no , no , no . - The descender rig ? What ? No , Simmons . Have to ... - I have to give her a case , and then ... - You know at some point you 're gonna have to talk to her , right ? - Good luck with the car . - Hey ... You 're very lucky , Trip . If they hadn 't used that clotting agent on your wounds ... Well , let 's just say I 'm glad they did . I recommend a week of solid bed rest . Bed rest ? Where 's that in the S.H.I.E.L.D. handbook ? [ grunts ] Whoa , stop it ! You 're going to rupture your sutures . I won 't be high-fiving anybody for awhile , but I 'm okay , Jemma . There was a doctor in the house , remember ? [ grunts ] So , what was he like ? - Skye 's dad ? - Yes . That man was out of his damn mi ... - Hey . Hi , Skye . - Hey , yourself . - Mission prep in five , cargo hold . - Right . Roger that . Talking about my dad ? - I 'm sorry . It must be so ... - Messed up ? I was going to use the off-color version of " messed up , " - but it felt inappropriate . - Oh , it 's appropriate . My dad , Ward , the Obelisk , the city ... it 's all messed up . And ... I just ... I can 't shake this vibe that something really bad is about to happen . You mean like someone getting shot ? Yeah , I got that covered already , so you can lose that vibe . - We 're good . - That 's right . Yeah . Nothing but positive thoughts from here on out . [ chuckles ] That 's not wood , is it ? [ chuckles ] [ breathes deeply ] Here 's what we know . HYDRA 's on the move . They have the Obelisk and an expert who knows how to use it . We can 't let that happen , obviously . - Use it how ? - Based on our latest intel , there 's something very powerful inside it ... a weapon . Are we talking chemical , biological , energy-based ... ? Could be anything . It 's alien . While Simmons and I were undercover at HYDRA , Whitehall was looking to create an extinction-level event to kill millions of people . We have to assume that this weapon has the potential to do that . Because bad guys love their WMDs . Trick is , to activate the Obelisk , HYDRA has to take it to specific place . It 's like they have the keys to launch a nuclear warhead ... Now they need the lock ... a temple inside the city . - Any idea where this temple is ? - Glad you asked ... No . But it 's in the city , and we now know where that is . Even better , HYDRA doesn 't . Fitz ? On our mission to Australia , we hacked a military satellite network . Using that , we ran a multispectral topographic scan of the Earth , miles deep through the oceanic crust , looking to match ancient rock formations with the 3-D model of the city . And we found this . Isn 't that in the Bermuda triangle ? 'Cause that would explain a lot . Actually , it doesn 't have anything to do with the triangle . - We solved that back in the ' 80s . - Uh , Atlantis ? - Try Puerto Rico . - These white markers represent vertical air shafts that are close to the surface , possible entry points for the city , but most of them are under the ocean floor . Except for one ... here , in old San Juan , where we 'll enter the underground city . A survey team will test the tunnel 's structural integrity , - then locate the temple . - And then what , sir ? We blow the hell out of it . [ agents murmuring ] What about the Obelisk ? It 's still dangerous all on its own . One crisis at a time . Come on ... what do you mean you can 't break a hundred ? Sorry . Nothing over $ 20 . Raina : I 've changed my mind . I 'd like a chia water instead . - You got it , babe . Make it two . - Okay . I 've been thinking about our next trip . - Maybe Shanghai ? - You have expensive tastes . And a wandering spirit . [ laughs ] Be right back . Thank you . You know , Agent May , the whole point of embedding a tracker in somebody is that you don 't have to stalk them . Or did you just come by to say ... [ distorted ] Hello , Raina . Dr. Whitehall would like a word . [ tires screeching , horn honks ] Gonna want to make your next right . Next right . Unless you want to spend your last night on Earth In the hotel HYDRA . How ... I 'll explain later . Come here . Give me a hug . I 'm not hitting on you , okay ? I 'm S.H.I.E.L.D. Okay , just ... Stay close . And stay quiet . Shh . Bye-bye , HYDRA . I 'm Agent Sam Koenig . Coulson sent me . Sorry , but ... You 're gonna need a lanyard . [ camera shutter clicks ] I 'm telling you , sir , she looked exactly like Agent May , except for the freaky facial-scar thing . That was Agent 33 . She was wearing a nanomask , disguised as May , but May electrocuted her right in the face . Sam : Oh , that is so badass . Sam , I 'm on with the director . Thank you . You were saying you think HYDRA was there to kidnap Raina , not kill her ? Well , we counted four two-man teams , all non-tactical , all in full surveillance mode . And the freaky one told Raina that Whitehall wanted to talk . Question is why ... and why now . No idea , sir , but this is the first sighting we 've had of HYDRA since you let Raina out in the wild . Okay . I 'm sending Agent May with an extraction team . Sit tight until they get there . - Copy that , sir . - He 's sending the cavalry . Sweet ! Sam , what , are you 13 ? You can 't do a sit-up . You think you 're gonna hook up with the cal ... [ computer beeps ] Reporter : More news on the investigation of the horrific murder-suicide of Massachusetts Senator Christian Ward . FBI sources claim that while the senator did leave a recorded confession , other evidence found at the scene suggests another party may have been involved . He did it . You know Ward did it . - No doubt in my mind . - The senator should 've let us help . We tried , but he wanted nothing to do with us . All we can do now is try and catch Ward . Or put the son of a bitch down . Change of plans . We 're splitting up the teams . We 're going after Ward ? No , we 're not . HYDRA found Raina . Tried to grab her in Vancouver . Grab her . Not kill her . They 're grasping . HYDRA knows we found the city . Maybe they think she can help them . - We 're pulling an extraction . - And you 're leading it . I 'll head on to the city in the quinjet with Bobbi , Mack , and Fitz-Simmons . We need to locate that temple . So , you want me to go with them ? We 're all anxious to see the city , but I 'd like you to run point on Raina 's interrogation . I think she 'll respond to you . Yes , sir . I 'll spread the word . You don 't want Skye anywhere near that city , do you ? It 's not the city I 'm afraid of . It 's her lunatic father . - Keep an eye on her , okay ? - Of course . I 'm her S.O. Quinjet 's prepped . You almost ready ? Yeah , I was looking for the dwarf case . Well , ask Fitz . I 'm sure he 'll know . Ah . No . That 's all right . I 'm sure it 's around here somewhere . So ... how long were you two a thing ? [ chuckles ] A thing ? Fitz and I ? No . I mean , we never .. I-I never dreamed ... [ chuckling ] Okay . I 'm just gonna stop you right there . If this were an interrogation , you 'd have given me about nine visual cues to put you away . Maybe 10 . Look , I ... I know the story ... of what Ward did to you two how Fitz 's brain was damaged . - That 's not your issue , is it ? - No . So , what happened ? [ breathes deeply ] We were in the bottom of the ocean in a storage pod , left for dead , and Fitz ... he said something that caught me completely off guard . Ah , those three little words . Yes . Well , no . I mean , not exactly . [ sighs ] I barely had a moment to process what he was saying or how I felt about it . Next thing I know , he 's giving me the oxygen , water 's rushing in , and he 's ... he 's laying there , in the hospital bed . - He was so pale . - How long was Fitz in the coma ? Nine of the longest days of my life . And when it finally broke , he ... he couldn 't speak , he ... he just stared at me , confused . All I wanted to do was help him . All I wanted was my best friend back . Your best friend . I never thought of him as anything else . That said , I can 't imagine my life without him . It 's all very confusing . You 've never told him any of this , have you ? - Oh , lord , no . - Yeah , it 's tough . I wish I could give you some advice , but I 've never been friends with a guy first . It 's always been a roller coaster . Fast out of the gate , hit the drop , the turn , the loop , the screeching halt , then ... back in line to do it all over again . - But is the ride worth it ? - I 'll let you know when it 's over . You know ... at the very least , you should be honest with him . If you don 't have trust ... - Don 't die out there , okay ? - It 's Canada . Coulson : You two okay ? - Yeah . - Ready when you are , sir . - Good . Head on up . - Yep . All right . Time to go . I 'll see you in San Juan . See you there ... sir . [ grunts ] So ... you and Hunter ... again . - I know . - Mm . - Been through it enough times . - I know . Gluttons for punishment , I 'd say . Let 's not go down this road , okay ? You 're a big brother , but you 're not my big brother . Your personal life , that 's your business . I 'm just wondering if it means you 're bringing Hunter in on the other thing . - That ? No . - Well , I figured after we - lost Hartley , you 'd try to ... - No , he has no idea . - And I 'd like it to stay that way . - Copy that . [ cellphone beeps ] Excuse me , mate . [ grunts ] Somebody call an ambulance ! This guy just passed out ! - That 's impressive . - Thanks , Billy . No , I 'm Sam . Billy 's the shorter one . [ bodies thud ] Two more down . [ knock on door ] That 's not Sam 's knock . You two have a knock ? Yeah , we 're brothers . Of course we have a knock . Lanyard , please . Agent Skye . [ beeps , door unlocks ] Come on , Sam . You can 't just look through the damn peep hole ? I 'm Billy . Sam 's the shorter one . Okay . Right . Well , we need to move . Come on . [ grunts ] [ gunshots ] Go for the stairs ! Stairs , copy ! [ bones crack ] [ grunting ] [ bones crack ] Stand down , Agent 33 ! We can help you ! Unh ! I don 't need your help . There 's more coming . We need to ... What the hell is that ? May 's evil twin , formerly known as Agent 33 . I thought the Koenigs were creepy . - Tell Coulson we 're on our way . - Yes , ma 'am . [ door closes ] No tails on the way in ... none that I could spot , anyway . Then we 're good . You ever had the fried plantains here ? Tostones ? Yeah . Why ? I read about this place down the street where they put crab in them . I wouldn 't mind trying that . You know , after we save the world . [ cellphone beeps ] Diego texted me . He 's gonna be late . He 's always late . Said he 'd meet us on the other side of the plaza . This contact of yours , can we trust him ? He 's a politician , so , no , but he likes me . And he can get us those architectural plans ? Yes , and he 'll keep the local cops off of us . Things could get sticky , depending - on where we 're digging . - Ooh . Hats . Wish I was a hat guy . Some guys can really pull that look off , you know ? - What ? Too small ? - You know , for a guy who 's about to blow up a chunk of an underground city , - you don 't seem fazed . - You have concerns ? Just want to make sure that we 're here to destroy that weapon , not recover it . - Why would we do that ? - That 's what Fury would do . - I 'm not Fury . - No . But he did hand you the keys to the kingdom for a reason . [ sighs ] Look around you . Vendors selling their wares , bringing home a modest income . Locals buying fresh vegetables for dinner tonight . Tourists on their one vacation a year . - Point ? - They are the point . They 're the reason I 'm here , the reason there 's a S.H.I.E.L.D. There are 3 million people on this island , and I won 't let HYDRA turn them into collateral damage . With all due respect , sir , this kind of op , Fury would have a number . - A number ? - Of acceptable losses . My number is zero . For the record , I hate that phrase . That 's why I brought Fitz-Simmons ... not just to find the temple but to assess its structural integrity , minimize injury or destruction . Minimize destruction ? You really aren 't Fury , are you ? Come on , Bobbi . You ought to know me by now . Rather use a scalpel than a shotgun . Well , it 's HYDRA . Might need the shotgun . Why do you think I brought you ? There 's Diego . I 'll be right back . Okay . I 'm gonna go check on the landing gear . What ? No , no , no . Wait , wait , wait . No , no . Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . Why ... why ? Because the awkward silence in here ... is killing me . [ bag thuds ] [ breathes deeply ] - I 'd like to say something . - I 've been thinking ... - Please let me go first . - No ... I don 't ... - There 's something I need to ... - I know I 've got ... No , I ... I know things have been difficult between us since I got back from being undercover , but I need you to understand that I didn 't leave because - of what happened to you . - No , no , no , no , Jem ... Jemma . Jemma , please , because I 've got a whole ... It 's ... it 's hard enough to get the words out . I 've been thinking , and I 'm going to leave the lab so you can be the one who runs the science division . - You 're quitting ? - No . I 'm ... I 'm ... I 'm going to the garage , on the bus with Mack . - But why ? - You know why . You 're clearly far more ca ... cap ... capable than I am . - At this point , anyway . - That 's not true . You just need more time to heal and ... I 've had time , and I 'm ... and I 'm not better , So you should run the lab ... And I can work for you . I just can 't work with you . And ... I think that 's what 's best . The fort of San Cristobal ... held off the Dutch , the English , the Americans . But apparently , not the aliens . Coulson : Looks like your buddy Diego drew those plans . He got them from the city archives . They 're older than San Juan itself . According to Skye 's satellite spectrometry , there 's a vertical shaft under this fort . Looks like it 's right at the water 's edge . Think we 'll get a better vantage point from up there . According to the map , the garrison is located underneath that sentry tower . That 's the deepest part of the fort . - Coulson : And inaccessible to the public . - All the better for us . Won 't be easy to get equipment down there . Get ahold of Diego ... see if he can help us out . We need to stay ahead of HYDRA . Even if HYDRA locates the city , how do you think they plan on unlocking the Obelisk ? I mean , nobody can even touch the damn thing . That we know of . [ thunder rumbles ] Corner , two men wearing classic HYDRA black , trying desperately hard not to look conspicuous . - And failing . - Where 's May ? Good question . I 'll go check . S.H.I.E.L.D. must be quite happy . Your plan of dangling me like bait seemed to work . I thought Whitehall wanted to kill you , not kidnap you . Something must 've changed his mind . Maybe he thinks you know something about the Obelisk . How it works . Are you saying Whitehall has the Diviner ? Someone give that girl a new flower dress . - Well , that changes things . - How so ? They don 't want to kill me . They need me . - Need you for what ? - I can hold the Diviner . You mean the thing that turns people to stone ... - you can touch it ? - You don 't believe me . Honestly , everything that we 've been through , I don 't know what to believe anymore . When you hold it , these symbols appear . There 's a pull to them , like a sense of where the Diviner belongs . Sounds a little " Harry Potter " to me . It 's alien technology . The Diviner reads your DNA to determine if you 're worthy of its power . You 'll understand when you touch it . No , thanks . I 'd rather not die just yet . You wouldn 't , not according to your father . He believes you 're worthy , too . Listen , if you think you 're gonna trick me into touching that thing , you 're as crazy as he is . It 's not crazy . It 's our destiny . I 'm over here ! I 'm over here ! [ tires screech ] - Found May . - Get in ! [ tires screech ] [ dialing , ringing ] They 've got her , sir . I 'm sorry , but she did mention that they implanted a tracker in her . How fortunate . I 'll get my best man on it right away . So , what happened to Agent 33 ? You guys just left her there ? We had to . HYDRA was closing in . We almost didn 't make it out . - I wonder if that 's weird for May . - How do you mean ? Someone else having your face like that . - It 's just creepy . - Hey , Trip , how 's the shoulder ? Uh ... it 's getting better . Thanks . - We were talking about Agent 33 . - Ooh , with the freaky fried May face . Yeah , and the scary robot voice . Oh . [ robotically ] Crush , kill , destroy ! [ chuckles ] " Lost in space " ? Tv show ? You ... Is there something in my teeth ? What ? No . No . No , I was , um ... I was just wondering , how many of you are there , anyway ? - Brothers , I mean . - Both : 13 . 13 ? [ both laugh ] - Look at him . He fell for it . - [ chuckles ] Yeah . That gets people every time . Yeah , yeah , you ... you got me . You got me good . [ smacks lips ] Yes , the extraction was a success . Skye 's with Raina now . - How big was the HYDRA contingent ? - Not big enough . But they sent Agent 33 to take point . - You know she still has my face ? - I heard . Lucky her . Any theories why they came so hard at Raina ? Skye has one ... Raina claims that she can touch the Obelisk without being harmed . That 's ridiculous . I swear on my ... Said that it would lead them to the temple . - Do you believe her ? - Skye does . You were right about Raina opening up to her . You promised you would help me . - Have her stay at it . - You can 't leave right now . See if Skye can get me any recon on that temple . May : Copy that . [ cellphone beeps ] Where 'd your friend Diego go ? He won 't go down into the garrison . - Turns out he 's afraid of the legend . - What legend ? They call it " La garita del diablo ... " - The devil 's sentry . - Delightful . Yeah . The fort was built in the 18th century and helped repel some of our british ancestors when they tried to invade the island . But this particular guard tower was built in 1634 and is well-known as being haunted . [ thudding in distance ] - Now , that 's a deep hole . - And haunted , apparently . Not scared of ghosts , though , are you Mack ? I mean ... [ chuckles ] of course not . [ electricity crackles ] But w-what was that story ? The story is , several of the guards went missing in the middle of the night from this tower , never to be seen again . They simply vanished . It 's all preposterous , really . Yeah . About as preposterous as an alien city . - How 's it coming ? - Uh ... well , um ... - You should , um ... - Why don 't you ... - No , it 's all right . - You go first . - No , no , that 's all right . - Fitz , this is your ... - I know , but you ... - Someone start talking . Uh , we are ready to deploy , sir . - Would you like me to ... - No , no . Um ... How long will it take to survey the tunnel and locate the temple ? Uh , it depends on several factors , like the tec ... tec ... tect ... - Don 't look at me . - Uh ... Uh ... The , um ... The tec ... Tectonic stress levels ? Tectonic stress levels , yes , and the structural ... Structural integrity of the tunnels , how damaged they are . And how deep they go . Coulson : How will you know what the temple looks like ? Well , we 'll know it when we see it , I guess . We 'll be depending entirely on the data the dwarfs send us . [ beeping ] - What just happened ? - Uh , the tablet 's still working . Looks like they just went out . Raina : My very own S.H.I.E.L.D. I.D. We match . I 'm sorry for trying to run . I just got swept up in the moment . You 're lucky Coulson 's the forgiving type . Actually , I feel very lucky we found each other . Your father 's told me so much about you . It 's funny , since I 've never met him . Of course you have . When you were born . Did you know he actually delivered you ? That 's sweet . He also killed a whole bunch of people . He almost killed my friend Trip . Does he get emotional ? Yes . Violent , even ? Yes . But he 's also ... quite misunderstood . Then help me understand him . - Where did you two meet ? - Thailand . I was just a petty con artist , scamming tourists , running with a bunch of freaks , as we liked to call ourselves . My father was one of your freaks ? No . He took us in , cleaned us up ... showed us we weren 't freaks at all . Before I met your father , I was a lost soul with no clue of where I belonged . - The daughter he never had . - No . No one could ever replace you , Skye . You 're all he wants . All right . Let 's get some light down there . Eyeballing it , it looks at least 100 feet . That 's all right . I 'm not scared of heights . - The dark , however ... - Just get those dwarfs back online . Otherwise , we 're blind down there . Well , sir , it might not just be the dwarfs . Could be all electronics . [ electricity crackles ] Be honest , Skye . Haven 't you ever felt lost ... or had that feeling that you were part of something bigger ? Like you were special ? When you say " special , " what you really mean is " alien . " Is that what you believe ? We 're human , Skye . We just have the potential to be more . But the Diviner ? Now , that is most definitely alien . Where do you get this stuff ? - My father ? - Partly . But my grandmother came from a long line of special people who believed in a story , about the blue angels that fell from the heavens . The ancients called them the Kree . - And what do the Kree want ? - Change . That 's why they left the Diviner , as a guide to the temple , so the worthy would inherit the Earth . And do you know where this temple is ? That 's what the Diviner shows you . Only the worthy are allowed inside to witness its true power . And what happens to the people who aren 't worthy ? I hope they 've said their goodbyes . Three pulls on the cable means " help , " got it ? Yes , sir . - Let me down easy , turbo . - Please be careful . [ motor whirring ] [ wind howling ] Skye : We can 't let them go down there , May . - We have to stop them . - Calm down . You can 't let Raina get into your head . She 's not lying . Look , she said the Diviner was meant to guide the worthy to the temple . You see this ? It 's the same symbol I saw on the Obelisk . - It 's got to be the temple . - You 're sure ? Trust me . It is seared into my brain . We have to warn Coulson now . Something bad is about to happen . Damn it ! Why isn 't this working ? Getting some kind of interference . Whitehall : S.H.I.E.L.D. 6-1-6 ... do not engage your defenses , or you will be shot out of the sky . Whitehall . There 's HYDRA quinjets outside the windows on both sides . Then let 's step on it , shall we ? You have someone aboard that I want ... a woman named Raina . I 'm going to send over a representative to get her . Any attempt to evade or retaliate will be met with hostile fire . Uncloak and prepare to be boarded . Destiny calls . I hit bottom . Copy ? - Hey , I hit bottom ! - Fitz : Okay ! Aah ! Aah ! Aaaaaah ! Aaaaaah ! - Coulson : Get him up now ! - I 'm trying ! It 's at max power ! - He 's struggling on the line ! - Before the dwarfs went down , they scanned for signs of life . All readings were negative . Wait ! Wait , wait , wait ! I can see him ! - He 's coming up ! - Hang on ! - Get the harness off him ! - Hey , talk to me , Mack ! Mack ! Aaaah ! Mack ! Coulson : Stand back . Mack , talk to me ! What happened ? Were you attacked ? I don 't see any wounds or signs of blood . Mack ! What did you say ? I can 't hear you . - Run ! - Aah ! - Simmons : Oh ! - Coulson ! May : I 'm not going to give up the lives of everyone on this plane for Raina . She 's not worth it . HYDRA already has the Obelisk . If they have Raina , too ... We still have the edge . Coulson 's already on site . HYDRA 's not . How the hell did they find us ? - We were cloaked . - Ward : Raina 's tracker . Old frequency S.H.I.E.L.D. used during the cold war . What can I say ? I 'm a history buff . Lower your weapons . Anyone shoots , the plane goes down . - We all die . - Maybe it 's worth it . - Let 's not get carried away just yet . - Skye : First , you gave us Bakshi . Now you 're back with HYDRA ? Pick a side , Ward . Oh , I have . Don 't worry . Let 's go . With pleasure . You , too . What ? I made you a promise , Skye . I 'm here to keep it . You 're coming with us . The hell she is . Snap out of it , Mack ! I don 't want to hurt you . Fitz , icer ! Simmons : He 's not going down ! Why isn 't he going down ? - She 's not going anywhere . - May . - She comes , or the deal 's off . - May : Shut up . May , if I don 't go with him , he 's gonna blow this plane to pieces . - They 're HYDRA . They 'll do it anyway . - You can 't trust him , Skye . - Yes , you can . Skye , look at me . - Don 't talk to her . Skye , I give you my word ... come with me , we won 't fire a single shot . - Everyone gets out alive . - Good one . Is that what you told my brother before you killed him ? How many of you are there ? Skye you can 't . There 's no other way . You know that . Whatever happens , I can handle myself . Raina : Oh , Skye , don 't forget your tablet . You know , the one with the map of the city on it . [ groaning ] Mack ... it 's me . [ grunting ] [ grunts ] Ohh ! Aah ! Please , Mack , wake up . Don 't make me do this . Simmons : Ah ! Coulson : I got you . Shoot him , Fitz ! This isn 't an icer . These are real bullets . Damn it , Fitz , shoot ! Aah ! [ electricity crackles ] Give me your hand ! Aah ! No ! [ body thuds ] - Seal the tunnel . - What ? ! What about Mack ? ! That wasn 't Mack . Coulson : We 'll return in a moment . Update ? Ward 's mission was a success . He has Raina . But ... there was a complication . Go on . He also took a hostage from the plane ... the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent named Skye . - He said it was an insurance policy . - Really ? How curious . I 'll have to ask about that when we join him . What 's more important is they shot the S.H.I.E.L.D. plane down once and for all . Actually , sir , Ward let the plane go . That was not his decision to make . What are you waiting for ? Fix it . [ dialing , ringing ] Bravo 4 . You have a go . Shoot them down . Repeat ... shoot them down .

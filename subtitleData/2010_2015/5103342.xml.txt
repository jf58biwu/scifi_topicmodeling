 I 'm amazed we got permission to exhume the body . It 's backwards . They disregarded our investigation by burying him to begin with . a military cemetery ... It 's ridiculously expensive to dispose of a prosthetic body that can 't be reused . we can recover the cyberbrain . Where are the engineers ? Drawing straws at HQ . Apparently connecting to a dead criminal 's cyberbrain is " creepy " . We don 't know yet that he 's a criminal . Chief Aramaki ! then take it back to headquarters . What are you waiting for ? Put it down ! sir ! Don 't open that coffin ! This is from your unit . Are you military ? with Public Security Section 9 . We 're investigating Lieutenant Colonel Mamuro 's murder . I 'm seizing his cyberbrain and prosthetic body as evidence . and we 're investigating that too . Public Security has no right to ransack this place . We 'll bury him again when the case is closed . or fabricate evidence ? The military is in the middle of its first major shakeup since the war . It would be more suspicious if this only got an internal investigation . Mamuro would have been the first to say so . You knew him ? back when I was an Army man . There 's not a soldier in the world more squeaky-clean than he was . Your name and unit ? Unit 501 . 501 ? So you were his subordinate . Open it up . Can I ask your rank ? I was in the old Investigations Section . That 's all . They sold off whatever wouldn 't fit in the coffin to a junk shop . That 's not his body ! Get down ! you delinquent ? Why did you authorize Public Security 's involvement ? ! I had no choice . Unit 501 should be investigating this ! The higher-ups told us to stay out of it . Someone set a trap at his grave . Ignore it . His cyberbrain is gone ! This isn 't the time to stir up a hornet 's nest . Then you believe that he was taking dirty money ? He got mugged downtown . That much is fact . maybe he got lucky . too . Concentrate on your work for now . Work ? I distinctly remember asking you to analyze that infected hardware . you know . True enough . I 'll do the assignment . give me leave to go off-base and authorize direct debit . Such a problem child . I 'm only going to find out who set the trap . Very well .

What is this ? Any pain ? no . It 's similar to the phantom pain particular to cyborgs but that should not affect you . Could be a bad contact in your nervous components . Any other abnormalities ? No . We should do a full-body checkup to be safe . but I have a meeting to go to . you have visitors . They announced themselves as Public Security Section 9 . Say I 'm not here . As both a Special Cyborg and a recognized wizard-class programmer new regulations apply to you under the revised Weapons Act . The Prosthetics Maintenance Rule now applies to issuing identification or other ownership of assets . In Lt. Col. Mamuro 's letter on my reclassification he guaranteed my financial autonomy . he 'll receive a dishonorable discharge and all such documents will be void . You expect me to endure a position where I have to file paperwork every time I open my wallet ? The cost of prosthetic bodies far exceeds standard health insurance payouts . You ought to do your duty to the government which guarantees your right to life . This is the consent form for your monitoring and custody post-restructuring . Make an effort to understand your circumstances . Japan allocated a sky-high budget to promote cyborg development . Did they tell you to become Army property to foot the bill ? There were large deposits made to Mamuro 's accounts . someone withdrew all that money . What do you want ? of Unit 501 . No criminal record . You work with the Army and Public Security as a special consultant . You specialize in solving cybercrimes . I request that you track down the missing money and analyze the coffin records . you should get leave to go off-base . What 's the pay ? as a civilian . you know . A soldier famous for his integrity being shot to death in secret is a bigger issue . Hey ! How dare you ? ! I 'll send you a liaison who 'll double as a bodyguard . Think she 's in ? She 's as in the dark as we are . she 'll have to find out the truth . Still don 't want the 501 to investigate ? and our unit could get dissolved . Public Security offered me an assignment . Will you accept ? Lend me a hand . you 'll be at the end of the line . No one else will be able to protect you then . Being protected isn 't what I learned to do here ! I learned to make the most of my strengths ! I 'll grant permission for you to use Server 6 . Thanks . Just don 't forget the job I gave you . List the people working on the case . But this is clearly related to the LTC 's mugging ! We know he met up with the prostitute . We need a warrant for her cust- - It 's military jurisdiction ! You keep out of it ! you hear me ? That 's an order ! dammit ? ! 311.6 ) } Mamuro was being followed . What ? ! Hey ! St-Stop right there ! There you are ! if it isn 't the little tomboy from the lab . The one who infiltrated me ... is in that car ... ! Ow ! You fool ! That makes you a deserter ! Raizo ! Kusanagi ? Instructor Ibachi ... Don 't think you can do whatever you want just because you were Mamuro 's favorite ! Your selfish actions put the whole unit in danger ! That 's enough ! I 'll be the one to lecture her . That bitch only survived as a test subject . The number is a fake . He 's a slippery customer . at least . What does Kurutsu say ? Ignore it . Is your prosthetic body acting up ? I don 't know . another visitor . You 've got a strange one here to see you . What is this ? It uses signal lights ? How old is this thing ? come with me . Construct your learning base yourself . nice to meet you ! I 'm an autonomous-follower logistics system- - a " Logistics Conveyer Machine " . You 're Section 9 's " liaison who 'll double as a bodyguard " ? Chief Aramaki calls me a " Logicoma " ! Major Kusanagi . No synching . Explain things orally or as data . Um ... Any Army case information on the group identified as illicit arms dealers would be very useful to Chief Aramaki in tracking down a mobile land mine ! The Army ? Arms dealers ? sir ! You disappear . I 'll take it from here . Order acknowledged ! Optical camouflage ? Stay here and guard my bike . Right ! we 're almost there . Hi there ! Come on in . and this guy 's three sheets to the wind ! okay ? get it together ! Sit straight ! I fold . Gonna go hit the can . no fair ! But you had a great hand ! There . Warning ! Warning ! extremely close ! Don 't move . Who sent you ? ! Were you the ones who killed Lt. Col. Mamuro ? Huh ? Are you Public Security ? Answer me ! Ops H2976 code name Paz ! You 're undercover ? ! the group I 'm in with was hired for a hit . They said the target was a full cyborg so we 'd use mobile land mines . Three of ' em . And I 'm talking military-grade . Lt. Col. Mamuro 's murder ? Who knows ? Apparently somebody beat our guys to it and we let the mines get away . Where did the mines come from ? Maneuver Area 6 . That place is a joke . Might as well set foxes to guard a henhouse . Feel like proving it with me ? but I can 't just drop it . and I 'd cause trouble for my CO . Is your CO trustworthy ? Used to be . I see . Thanks for your cooperation . I wish I had your freedom of movement . You can 't analyze it ? It might just be noise . No full-body cyborg gets to leave this organization and go independent . You 're just a girl with a little talent for cyber warfare . Mamuro 's death was an inevitability . or I 'll take you out . Kurutsu and Ibachi can 't shield you from me . An inevitability ... all right . All that 's left is to connect the dots ... I 've got authorization ! And all I 'm gonna do is ask questions ! Take your complaints to the station . dammit ... This is bullshit ! They 're not even he- - sorry . I 'm a special investigator with the Niihama police . I was told I could find these two here . I have some questions for First Lieutenant Moto Seta and Captain Amuri Noto here- - Thanks . You just connected some dots . And I see some others just connected . How about showing yourself ? Batou the Ranger ? Long time no see . Gotta say I didn 't figure you for this one . What do you mean ? The man you killed seven days ago was a comrade of mine ! I just got back to Japan three days ago . really ? ! I 've told you your sleepless eye 's weakness is how easy it is to infiltrate . Still afraid of taking friendly fire out in the jungle ? I 'm an electronic warfare specialist too ! I can 't believe you infiltrated me in the middle of a fight ! You 're just about the only one who 'd infiltrate me . why are you after me ? Don 't play dumb ! You 're the one who got this place 's mobile land mines ! What the hell ? ! Wait ! Don 't shoot ! Run ! Don 't ! Those guys aren 't with you ? ! what are you talking about ? look ! They found us ! They want to eliminate us here . And their excuse will be " a training exercise accident " ? I can 't stop ' em with this puny gun ! We 'll just have to run ! Now we climb ! Climb this ? ! Damn straight ! so get moving ! fine . Hello ! What 's that ? ! We 're surrounded . move it ! I know ! Get in ! I thought you " couldn 't drop it " ? This makes a nice change of pace . You asked the military police for help ? To escort a suspect . What 's this about ? This makes no sense . Major Kusanagi . And second : the bullet you fired on the mobile land mine at the graveyard matched the one that killed Lt. Col. Mamuro . a prostitute here in town was shot to death . The bullet matched the one that killed Mamuro . and according to the other working girls he was asking questions about one of her clients . one of my fellow Rangers along with his family . too . it led me to the major here . she says she got back to Japan three days ago but Immigration records say it was seven days ago . The three mines my group was supposed to use were the same model as the one Section 9 dug up at the graveyard . Assuming one of those three was buried and another killed the Ranger there 's one more left unaccounted for . all the clues point to you murdering Mamuro and stealing his money . I got a message and an attaché case from him . Major Kusanagi . I doubt I 'll be in this world much longer . I wanted to get justice . I 've left your recommendation in someone else 's care . You 're the most promising squad member I know . I wish you luck . I found data on an internal weapons exportation racket and this gun . You 've moved a lot of money in the past few days . Who are you sending it to ? The widow of the man who raised me . but she 's in a nursing home now . What 's her name ? What is this woman 's name ? huh ? your brain never forgets the original . Pain in the ass . I don 't have an " original " body . What ? Have you heard of Doctor Bakeru 's emergency medicine system ? That thing where someone with a full prosthetic body uses their life-support system on somebody else ? The person who raised me used it on me while I was in my mother 's womb . Supposedly a chemical weapon killed a large number of civilians way back when . A pregnant woman and the man assumed to be her husband both died . We don 't even know their names . Because someone with that particular lifesaver happened to be on the scene the fetus 's brain alone survived . You 're saying you were made a full cyborg at birth ? ! I lack any memory of a body . created by false memories . This is surveillance footage from Maneuver Area 6 . Your subordinate is in it . If you refuse to hand her over I 'll present you with a summons signed by the Defense Minister himself . I 'll submit a written report at a later date . I can 't hand her over . Vixen . I 'll make you regret this . That 's Shujiro Kanzaki . He 's in charge of Maneuver Area 6 and he leads a team of special agents . He 's also the Army 's dirty go-between with the Ministry of Defense . Don 't worry . I 'll protect you . What 's wrong ? It 's nothing . It 's been empty from the beginning ? Then where 's the gun ? ! Why did I think there were whistle-blowing documents in it ? ! And the lieutenant colonel ... ? What 's real ? What 's the truth ? Where 's the lieutenant colonel 's cyberbrain ? Kusanagi . Calm down . The hardware Kurutsu had me analyze matched his Net synch pattern . weren 't we ? With something hypothesized to be a cyber-virus . We speculate that it 's a self-destructing Stuxnet-type which causes unknown dysfunction . Unknown dysfunction " ... You mean false memories . It was purely a hypothesis . until we checked into your behavior . you know . True enough . When did I come back to Japan ? seven days . And yet you continue to claim it was another day altogether . Route of transmission ? It must have been contact with Mamuro 's cyberbrain . Which is still with his prosthetic body . His coffin was a trap . And the records Public Security got of his burial show no signs of tampering . So that 's how it is ... synch with me . Are you sure ? Just get on with it . Record my field of vision and play it back in real time . Roger ! I see things that shouldn 't be there . I don 't see things that should be there . the whole time ... ? 103 ) } " Special agent " " The LTC is innocent This is a warrant for Major Kusanagi 's arrest . Surrender her immediately . 103 ) } " Special agent " " The LTC is innocent What happened to this room ? ! The records weren 't tampered with . They just buried the truth under a lie . I 've found it ... My reality . Drive . The lieutenant colonel came to you to blow the whistle . Vice-Minister of Defense ? Yes . But you ordered a cover-up . Because it couldn 't be made public ! We ignored treaties and sold arms to Third World countries during the war to relieve its financial burden on us . That 's governmental weapons smuggling ! and as their security official what 's the matter ? Lt. Col. Mamuro found out about the illegal trade . Vice-Minister ! What is it ? Do you realize how much He 's in danger ! the missile business has helped our country 's finances ? ! The lieutenant colonel learned of your cover-up and investigated . The prostitute you frequented . The Ranger who escorted you . he decided to blow the whistle on you . So you ordered Captain Kanzaki to kill him . I just ordered him to solve the situation ! but I don 't know who killed Mamuro . maybe he really was mugged . You claim even you don 't know ? and I don 't want to ! That arms dealing will be purged during restructuring anyway and we 're deliberating next-generation weapons to replace missiles . But this mess kills the job Harimadara has lined up for when I leave office ! You 're quite the chatterbox . A desire to confess ? you 'll never tell anyone ! Stop ! Someone help ! Should 've blown him away . Wasn 't being more than a killing machine the whole point of getting out ? I had no place to go . They traced us through the remote control . They 're coming . You go on . They 're mine . There are two of them . Fine with me . We 'll see who 's the better killer . Take care . You too . but they 're not the only ones to benefit from his death . Yes . Thank you . You 're the ones who killed the lieutenant colonel ! I 'd take you out . That 's enough of that . Kusanagi . Raizo and Ibachi were luring the enemy here with the money as bait . We 've eliminated six spies . That 's plenty . I moved it ... and you used it . That 's right . The gun used on the prostitute was the beginning of the enemy plot . the phony bribery ... All the blame was placed on Mamuro . And he intended to bring the Vice-Minister down with him . It was the worst possible choice . Unit 501 would have gone on the Army purge list in retaliation for the scandal . So you let him die . All of you . maybe we could have saved him . the only option was to secure and the money before he got blown up . But what neither we nor the enemy accounted for was you . I went after the lieutenant colonel . And you were infected by his cyberbrain . you were continually losing memories . 101 ) } " The LTC is innocent What organization developed the virus ? Unclear . All we know is that a foreign broker brought it here and that people call it " Fire-Starter " . Was it a foreign power that cooked up the scandal ? Our enemy is the global military-industrial complex itself . What would dragging down one vice-minister accomplish ? Did you take the disc he left me ? I did that to protect you . You used me as bait for the enemy ! I did that to protect the organization . Why did you stand back and watch him die ? I did that to protect myself . Kusanagi . I 'll build a future for you . The pain is gone now . Section 9 and the review committee have formally cleared Lt. Col. Mamuro of suspicion . we will implement it . we also grant you the post-reorganization major rank . in accordance with the will of your late legal guardian you 'll receive a testamentary trust . It 's an inheritance from the person who raised you . A portion of it is earmarked for the purchase of your prosthetic body . Which means that your body is now your property and is outside Army jurisdiction . You 're quite sure about this ? The virus may be an unknown but we 've identified the architecture of the false memories . Do it . Very well . We 'll attempt memory eradication . Will you go ? Yes . Make sure to pay your respects to your parents . Thanks . I 'm going . We 'll find a replacement . Want a ride ? Consider it my thanks for telling us the location of Mamuro 's cyberbrain . I 'll take the bus . Then I 'll just give you the results . Captain Kanzaki was replaced . Mr. Sadamoto will be tried in closed court . I promise to make the lieutenant colonel 's findings public one day . I see . By the way- - are you the one he gave my recommendation to ? Hard to say . A man in my position gets a lot of those . one of them outlined plans to create a new special unit within the international rescue team . I 'd like someone who 's got experience as a special consultant . but I don 't want to work under a man who digs up people 's graves . You dug up something even deeper . you should have your own team . The regulations say a unit needs a minimum of one commander and six members . I 'll keep that in mind . but for taking the offensive . huh ? whom shall I scout ... ?

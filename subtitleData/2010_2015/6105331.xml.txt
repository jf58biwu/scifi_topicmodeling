Captain Colter Stevens , this is Beleaguered Castle , acknowledge transmission . Captain Stevens , do you copy ? Where am I ? You are with " Beleaguered Castle " Are you functional ? I am dizzy . Did I ... Did I just a-lock ? Adjusting your rotation . Can you report this time ? Fuck is this ? What this is ? Wher ... . who I am talking to ? Captain report what you saw . What , I don 't understand it - Where were you before you were talking to me ? - There was an explosion . - Coming from where ? - Some confusion is perfectly normal at this stage , Captain . Do you have a visual signal ? Who are you ? You already have that information , Captain . - I do ? Recall my name . We 'll rebuild the pattern . Try to focus . I ... was on a mission I was flying ... And then I woke up on a train . Now I am here . I need to be briefed . Uhm , wha-what unit is this ? You 're with Beleaguered Castle . - Who ? - Stand by for thread 1 of alpha memory pattern . - What is " beleaguered castle ? " - The exercises will assist you . Memory thread 1 . Listen to the Lilly awoke in an evening dress and an opera cloak .. ... in her hand were 5 play cards - Is this a joke ? - The Queen of Spades , Four of Clubs ... .. Nine of Clubs , Three of hearts , Nine of Hearts Is this a red flag exercise ? End of thread 1 . Thread 2 : The following is a recording of a western screetch-owl End of thread 2 . End of pattern . Acknowledge . Acknowledge end of pattern . Stand by to initiate pattern recall ? Go for pattern recall . Arrange the 5 playing cards in order of descending value irrespective of the suit . Queen , two nines , four and a three - That is correct - The passage I read contained mention of a woman 's name . What was that name ? Her name is Lilly . That 's correct Recall my name . Goodwin , your name is Goodwin ... That is correct . Welcome back , Captain . Ma 'm , I need to talk to my father . Has anybody been notified that I am stateside ? Who bombed the train , Captain ? What ? - Who bombed the train ? - A woman kept calling me " Shawn " . That is incidental . Think Captain , remember back . Who bombed the train ? I don 't know who bombed the god damned train . Then go back and try again . - Back where ? - You will have 8 minutes , same as last time . No , no , no , no , no . No more bullshit sim tests , ok ? I need to know , where I am , what is the location and condition of my crew . Does anybody know , that I am stateside ? You are obligated to give me this information ! - Start with the bomb ! - Where is it , what does it look like . What kind of explosive , how is it detonated . - Right , right ... - Find the bomb and you 'll find the bomber . - Find the bomb ... . wait nooo ! - I took your advice . It was good advice . Thank you . Yeah , its good . And I signed for a NALSAR course . Next thing you know , I 'll be moving to India to find myself . Dont say ... . - Know any good Gurus ? - Oh , she got your shoe ... So , what do you think ? Am I on the right track ? It 's the same train but it 's different . Deep . I hope it 's different . I feel the same way . What ? - My hand ... Brian ... What is it with guys , everything is more beautiful in retrospect . This looks so real . You know , I think it 's gonna be really good for me to get as far away from him as possible . Unbelievable detail . - Ticket. - May I see your ticket ? Thanks . They wouldn 't put the doer in front of me . The doer ? You are the pretty girl . The distraction . " Distraction " ? - Every sim has one. - Hey are we gonna make up the ten minute ? - We are gonna try. - Are you talking about Brian ? - Hey Grandpa .. - What the hell was the delay back there ? What you late for ? - What ? - You seem concerned about the time . What are you late for ? I 'm late to an asshole festival ... I hear you re headlining . Oh thats funny . Who are you , a comedian ? Yeah , he is a ... comedian . Sit down , freak . Fans ... Thats the guy . He came in 3rd on America 's Got Talent . Got sided twice for DUI . We talked about him . - Thank you , ma 'm , thank you. - You are welcome . - " Glenbrook station " - Yeah , but at 1 o 'clock the bridge is gonna be jammed. - Damn it ! Ah , I am sorry . Hey Mr. , hey You dropped this . - Ah , thanks. - " All aboard , doors are closing " The explosion came from behind me . What 's with you ? - Out of time to talk to you right now. - I got time for you . Chicago , Union Station " Oh , shit ! Goodwin , you gonna tell me how to disarm this ? Should I ... .. unplug it ? Or do you want me to just leave it ? Ok , ehmm I am just gonna leave it . Ok ? Ladies and Gentleman , Transit Security . You 're not . - Due to a classified security-breach I need all of you turn off your personal electronic devices till we pull into the station , ok ? That means laptops , cellphones , Cellphone Sir . Cellphone , Sir ! Thank your very much . Pagers , anything electronic . Thank you . It 's a precautionary measure , it 's nothing to worry about . So which is it , security breach or precautionary measure ? Sir ! Is there a problem here , Sir ? - I am in the middle of a very big deal ... - Shawn ? I need you to turn that off . Why you don 't show me that ID again ? Shawn ! Turn it off ! What 's your problem , asshole ? Hey ! Shawn , what are you doing ? Hey , not a good idea m 'am . Not a good idea . Oh , that 's not a good idea . I think you broke his jaw . It 's ok , he is not any more real than you are . I am not real ? How about next time you drive to work ! There 's not gonna be a next time . Stabilize . Lower your pulse . Did you find the bomb ? - Yes ... . - There is hydraulic fluid all over the floor . It 's not a concern , Captain . What is ... - Tell me about the bomb. - Where is that man ? I saw a guy with a crutch on the monitor . He looks like he is in charge , I wanna talk to him . - That 's irrelevant , Captain - I wanna talk to your commanding officer ! - You can talk to him upon completion of your mission. - My mission is in Afghanistan , where my unit is . I flew two god damn sorties yesterday . You 've been with us for 2 months . Did you id the bomber ? - No , where is my unit ? - And under who 's jurisdiction is this simulation ? Captain , this is not a simulation . Lives are depending on you . What lives ? What do you remember about the bomb ? Tell me about the detonator . No , no , no , what lives ? What you are talking about ? I need to be briefed ! Sir , I need to give him something . - That 's fine , go ahead. - Get ready to send him back in . At 7 : 48 this morning CST , a bomb exploded on a commuter train outside of Chicago , killing everyone on board . and thats the train that you 've been on . No , no , no , I am right here , you are talking to me right now ! A man named Shawn Fentress was on that train . He , for all intents and purposes , is now you . Every second spent explaining things puts more innocent civilians at risk . This makes no sense . The train explosion was the first attack of a series . There are going to be more . Now , did you find the bomb ? In the restroom , ventilation panel above the sink . Cellphone detonator . Are we done ? Eh , no no . But that 's good , that 's very very good , Captain . Good . Our record show that 1812 calls ended at the moment of the explosion . 52 of those calls were tethered to the cell tower nearest the train . So one of those calls was made by our bomber . Do you remember a freight train passing by just before the explosion ? Yes . The explosion was timed to engulf the passing freight train which means , the bomber had to be watching both trains when the call was made . 52 callers , one of those is our bomber . I want you to concentrate on the passengers in your car . Get to know them , narrow the suspect pool . Look for ones who seem quiet or withdrawn , who seem nervous . As always , you 'll have 8 minutes . 8 minutes , and I blow up again ? Yes . I need you to discipline yourself on this next pass . Perform only the task that we assign you . Everything else is irrelevant . Charge the drivers . Is my father even ... I took your advice ... It was very good advice . You 're kinda quiet today . - Just got a lot on my mind . Careful. - Yikes . Oh , so sorry - Don 't worry about it. - That 's very kind of you . You 're very decent . Thank you . And real . - Ticket. - How 's everything today ? - It 's good. - Anything out of the ordinary ? - Uhmm no. - I mean behavior on the train . Is anything ... Anybody seems strange to you ? You look strange . How about you , does anybody looks suspicious ? Are you drunk or something ? - Come here . For a second. - Come on . Just think of it as a game . - A game ? - They are all so utterly normal , Shawn . That 's what so terrifying about them . Maybe there 's a team network . The sleeping giant coached with the minister and them out there . Don 't forget the sullen college kid , he is the expendable one . I bet they are all controlled by the conductor . Standing there dictatorial demanding tickets . You are funny . - Damn it. - What about that guy ? - Deposition. - About that woman sitting across from him ? Hair appointment , every Monday , you know this . You talk to this people more than I do . Right , right . And the guy behind her ? He 's late for an audition , right ? To recorded offenses ... That 's the guy that was sided to SUD . - A DUI , I know . Hey , hows the signal in here ? - It 's good . Is teaching not stimulating enough for you anymore , Sherlock ? Oh oh , now we slip to the racial profiling , that is . - Did anyone else come out of the bathroom over there ? - Well , I saw you coming out of there . - Me ? - Yes . - No - Me ? - Hey Mr - . Hold on , hold on a second . Just hold on a second . It 's gotta be something near . A broken phone . Christina ? - Yeah ? - Excuse me . Hey , hey come with me . - This isn 't our stop ! - Now come on , let 's take a walk . - We don 't get off here. - I don 't know , just be spontaneous . - You gonna freaking me up ... - I know this gonna sound really weird but I have a really bad feeling about this train and I think that we should get off , ok ? Just get your stuff . " All aboard . Doors are closing . " Come on , come with me . So what now ? - Wait , one ... ..... , I 'll be right back ! - Ready to get that coffee now ? Oh sorry , yeah , ah ... Jus - , just one more second , ok ? Oh for God 's sake . Feel sick ? It 's motion sickness , I get it all the time . Excuse me ... Excuse me . Are you following me ? - Can I borrow your phone ? - No , I don 't have one . Sure ? - Yeah , I am sure. - Why you don 't leave me alone please ? Or I call the police . With what ? I thought you said you didn 't have a phone . You know , you have no right ... . What are you doing ? Gimme my bag back . Are you crazy ? Shawn ! - Get back ! - Shawn , what 's going on ? Shawn ! Stop , Shawn ! It wasn 't you . - What the hell is wrong with you ? Are you insane ? - No ! - No , no ! Where is it ? - Get away from me ! - Where is it ? - Get away from me , please ! - Shawn , Shawn , get up ! Shawn ! Shawn , listen to me , get up ! Shawn - Gimme your hand , get off the track ... ... Mr. C 'mon - Shawn , Shawn , Shawn , get up ... . Goodwin ? Come in , do you read me ? Captain Stevens , this is Beleaguered Castle , do you copy ? Please respond . It 's freezing here , whats going on . What 's that ? He is in trouble . I think the oxygen just went out . Goodwin ? Goodwin ! Find a way to get through to him . What is it ? What 's going on ? It 's not the tertiary cooling ether . Just keep sending strings out , see if he hooks on to something . It 's hard to say exactly what he 's going through . Sir ... - Please - It 's not a whole lot we can do from here . If nothing changes , how much time does he have ? - Some ... - ... . and not long . Lilly awoke in an evening dress and an opera cloak , in her hand were 5 playing cards ... Goodwin , you out there ? Goodwin , who is Goodwin . - This is Captain Stevens , do you copy ? - Captain Stevens ? The capsule lost power . The capsule ? Is that where you are now , Captain , in a capsule ? You should know , who are you ? - Let me get Captain Goodwin , get to it ! - You invented this thing , right ? I did . - Are you in command here ? - I am . Were you able to locate the information we need , Captain ? That 's a negative Sir . I was unable to find the bomber , but I did save her . A passenger on the train . I got her off safely , a woman . Captain , it 's gonna be counterproductive for you to try to save anyone on that train . They 're outside the mission . Well , but she survived . And maybe the rest could too . She survived , but only inside the Source Code . None of them will be safe . What is this Source Code ? It 's quantum mechanics parable calculus . It 's very complicated . Try me ! Fine . When a light bulb 's turned off , there is an afterglow , a lingering halo-like effect . You seen it ? Yes - Of course - The brain is like that , its electromagnetic field remains charged , just briefly even after death . Circuits remain open . Now there is another peculiarity about the brain . It contains a short-term memory track that 's approximately 8 minutes long like a convenience store 's security camera that only records the last portion of the day 's activity on its hard drive . Now combining these two phenomena , circuitry that remains viable postmortem and a memory bank that goes back 8 Minutes Source Code enables us to capitalize on the overlap . Shawn Fentress died on that train , of all the passengers aboard he was your best link . You two share the compatibility in terms of gender , body size and your synaptic maps . What happens after the 8 minutes ? - After ? Nothing. - You cease to exist on the train . You cannot exist inside the Source Code , beyond Fentress ' 8 minutes . Source Code is not time travel . Rather , Source Code is time reassignment . It gives us access to a parallel reality . Now the deaths on the train were a tragedy but Source Code empowers us ... - No , but I saved ... . - one person , that girl , that 's always sitting across from me . I pulled her off the train . Give me her name . Christina , I don 't remember her last name . Her name was Christina Warren . - Yes ! - She was 28 - That 's her - born in Moline , Illinois . Died this morning on the train . No , no , I pulled her off . She 's fine . No , she isn 't . - Believe me , she is - Believe me . - She saw me get hit by the express train. - This isn 't us getting anywhere . - No , no , no , wait , wait ... . - We have to send him in . A second attack is imminent , Dr. Rutledge . What second attack ? - The train was just the beginning - A letter of intent . - I am sorry , what are you telling me here ? - We have information that Downtown Chicago is the next target . And they 're planning to detonate a dirty bomb . You have any idea how many people would die if an explosion of that magnitude were to occur in the city ? We 're evacuating as we speak . We 've to stop it before it happens , do you understand ? If you find the bomber , his second attack , the real attack , we think , can be prevented . We have very little time left . Out here the clocks only move in one direction . Charge the drivers . On the upper deck of the next carriage there is a conductor 's compartment . It 's a small office containing a strongbox . Inside is a loaded handgun.Get to it . You are authorized to use whatever force necessary . I took your advice ... .... It was very good advice ... .... You 're still here . - Of course I am - Guess what ? You 've quit your job and you enrolled in a NALSAR course . Good guess . Soda can . Coffee spill . Listen to me ... Don 't answer this . You deserve better than that guy . Everything looks more beautiful in retrospect , doesn 't it ? How did you know there was ... . How well do you know me ? - Not that well apparently - Do you know me well enough , that if I did something that looked a little strange and was maybe even a little bit dangerous and told you to trust me anyway , that you could do that ? No . Wow , that was honest . You are beautiful , you 're kind , and you are painfully honest . Who are you and what did you do with Shawn Fentress ? - It 's the new me - I don 't want to hurt you . No I am not gonna sit in my seat , alright ? He is bleeding , he needs medical attention . Is it true that you tried to steal a gun out of the train security box ? Careful ma 'm ! Dammit ! - What were you thinking ? - Can I borrow your phone ? - No ! - You need to go to the hospital , Shawn . - Please , please - No , you need help - Can I borrow your phone ? - No ! Why do you want my phone ? What would you do if you only had one minute left to live ? - I don 't know - I would call my dad . I would hear his voice and I 'd tell him I am sorry . Tell me everything is gonna be ok . Everything is gonna be ok . Oh yeah , the gun in the strongbox , that was a really great idea . Thanks for that . Did you make any progress ? - Can I get access to a phone ? - I need to talk to my father . I will try to work on that soon . Yes , I will try ... . Goodwin , how I am doing ? I am just trying to measure my performance here . Have you ever gotten back in ? Am I doing any better than you did ? No , we 're wasting valuable time here . No , no , I have never been on the other side of a Source Code mission . I wouldn 't be a viable candidate . Why not ? .. CAOC-N , what is that ? .. Because the specifications are extremely narrow . What are they ? Captain , you should have found the suspect by now . This tactical advantage , this tremendous tool that we 've given you . Don 't squander it thinking . Do . Please contact my father for me . This will stop at some point , Captain . As soon as you finish the mission . And you re doing really great . This will end . Whoever planted the bomb had to have equipment of some kind . Gloves , a screwdriver to get into the over the head vent , flashlight , something . Check bags , backpacks , briefcases , anything . So ... I took your advice . It was very good advice . - Hey Grandpa ! - What are you doing ? - I am just ... - trying to remember something . What is that ? - It 's a Military patch - Were you in the Military ? A friend of mine was . He was in Afghanistan and he disappeared and no one has heard from him since . Do you have the Internet on your phone ? No , it 's just connected to the office by a really long piece of string . Do you think , you can see what you can find on this guy ? - Sure.- He 's been on my mind a lot lately , his name is Captain Colter Stevens , he is in the 17th Airborne . Ok , you owe me . I 'll buy you a cup of coffee ... - Why don 't I get one for you now - Christina Ehmm , I 've been having these dreams lately ... Really vivid ... and you 've been in them . - Really ? - What ... oh , no ... No that I wouldn 't . I .. It 's just ... Ehm , I 'll call you back in a minute honey . Yeah . Cramming ? - Uh , yeah - For what ? Ehh , Psych .. And I got a big test this morning , so I should get back to it . Can I borrow a pen ? - Eh , yeah , sure - Woooh ! Hey , that 's not cool man ! Man ... Your is a mess . - What you doing man ? - never find what I am looking for , just like my bag . Just like my ... How about you let the guy have his bag back ? - Finish your deal ! - Stay out of this tough guy or doesn 't end well for you . You can 't do that . What am I doing ? What am I doing here ? Jesus . Dick . C-O-C-N . Excuse me , ma ' , m . Ehi , how you doing , good morning . You work at Walter Reed ? Yeah , I used to . Ehm , I am in the Military . - You are in the Military ? - Yeah , yeah I am . - What was going on down there ? - Oh you know , we were just having a little bit of an argument actually about , about this patch . Is that what they train you to do ? Assault civilians ? - Ma 'm please . Do any of these letters , they look familiar to you ? Do you know what the " N " stands for ? - It 's Air Force and the " N " stand for Nellis - Can I borrow your phone ? You know what , actually I can pay for it . I don 't even have to borrow , I can pay you for it . ... have like 100 dollars ... - I don 't want your money - Just bring it back . - All right , thank you so much - Come on , come on , come on , come on ... . Post operator . Uhm , Rutledge please . - Please hold - Say , please ? - You tell him Captain Colter Stevens is calling - Hold the line . All aboard . Doors are closing . Dr Rutledge will be on in a moment . I have to tell you something . - I know , I found him - Your friend ... - I got him. - An Air Force Base . In Las Vegas . - No , he 's not - He 's dead , Shawn . - What ? - I am sorry . Your friend was killed in action two months ago . No , you must have gotten the name wrong . Colter Stevens , 17th Airborne helicopter pilot , was on the first site I tried . His father 's name is Donald , right ? " Donald Stevens will join host Eleonor Gwah to discuss the death of his son , Army Captain Colter Stevens who died in Afghanistan in February and was honored posthumously with the silver star . Also on the broadcast will be Army Sergent Rorbert Alvarez , whose life was saved by Captain Stevens in a firefight just outside of Kandahar . I 'm sorry . Captain . Shawn ... talk to me . - Captain.- Captain Stevens , my name is Captain Colleen Goodwin . You 're with operation Beleaguered Castle . You are safe . Now , can you tell me what you see ? Just look and think . - I see a card - That 's good . Do you copy , we 're taking a lot of RPG fire here . Am I dead ? A radio listing is saying that I died in a helicopter crash in country , and my father received a medal for me . - Your condition is not the issue here - You need to focus on preventing any subsequent attacks . Everything else is irrelevant . News report saying that I am dead is irrelevant ? Until the person or persons who blew up that train are in custody ... yes ! Goodwin . One soldier to another . Am I dead ? Part of your brain remains activated . What about the rest of me ? I can see my hands and my feet . They still move . They 're a manifestation . They 're just your way of making sense of all this . So .. what are you saying ? Are you saying that I am imagining this ? I 'm imagining that ... I am still alive , that I am in this capsule ? We have fourth amp dropping . Captain , what just happened ? Can I ask you a question ? The capsule is a manifestation as well . Where am I ? - Thats classified - Fuck you ! Captain , I can not imagine what you must be feeling right now , but if are to prevent a second attack , we need to send you back immediately . And Captain , you cannot deviate from the mission while inside the Source Code . Even to investigate your , hmm ... Even to investigate what happened to you . There is only one continuum on this end and it can 't be unsettled . Well , you know , I did unsettle it . I called you from the train . Just before the explosion , so 7 : 46 this morning they paged you with a call ... .. You may have made that call from the train , but I would never receive it here . It 's a different reality , Captain . If the call even went through it would be received by a different me entirely . This may be difficult for you to hear , but you are a hand on a clock , understand ? We set you , you move forward . We reset you , you move again . And that represents the entirety of your function here . You know what , next time , I 'll send you a pizza . I see , if that makes an impression . You cannot alter the continuum of this reality from within the Source Code . This can 't be legal what you are doing . In fact , your acquisition by this program as well as the program itself , has been reviewed and sanctioned by a military court . You know , many soldiers would find this preferable to death . The opportunity to continue serving their country . Have you ... . Have you spent much time in battle , sir ? Uh ? That 's immaterial . Any soldier I 've ever served with could say that one death is service enough . Fine , you can have that in return for completing this mission . Wha ... Have what ? - I 'll give you what you want - Terminate your service , let you die . This is taking too long , you 've been to easy on him . No more rest periods . I am certain , we can find other service men with wounds similar to yours who 'll consider being a part of this program an honor . Uh ? No , no , no , no , no . Wait , wait . What ? Send him back . Charge the drivers . And Captain Stevens , I 'd like you to remember that it 's not only about you , but it 's also about 2 million real world Americans . Now you may not value your own life , I do however ask that you value theirs . Advice ... . Hey Grandpa ... .. Calm yourself , you 're back . Did you find the bomber ? Uh ... .. There ... are hundreds of people on that train . Well , then check them out one by one . Doesn 't matter what you do to them , they 're already dead . Get to that gun and shoot them all if you have to , but get us some usable intel . No ! No , wait ! We have to keep doing this , until you find the bomber . - Please , I am trying , I am trying - Who is the bomber ? I am trying . I am sorry , Captain . I know you are exhausted and we are all frustrated , but we can not fail . You can do this . I can 't , I can 't ... - Yes , you can - You are a born hero , son . Even your father thinks so . Saving people is what you do best . It was about a stir , too . I didn 't wanna regroup back I just ... .. started feeling like he didn 't wanna come home anymore - Dad ? - Somehow , he couldn 't come home . and he wouldn 't talk to me ... . wouldn 't hear me . Hardly said he just ... . couldn 't leave his unit out there without him and that was that . Those guys ... . were his family . I said two things I shouldn 't have . I don 't know . I never fully understood him . And I can 't believe he is gone . Send me back in . Please don 't blow me up again . Hello ? I know , its you . I am gonna find you . Turn around ? Hey there . - Me ? - Why you look so surprised ? Don 't . Move . Move . Move . The bag over there . Move over , put the bag over there and move over . Move over . Now hand me your phone . You 're done ! You 're done . - What ? - You can 't kill anybody anymore . - What ? I don 't understand - You gonna trigger the bomb with your phone . - What ? - I swear I don 't know what you 're talking about . Listen , my name is George Troxel , I am software engineer , ok ? I was talking to my wife . Try it again . Your call , dial it again . Ok , I am gonna press redial . Your phone is gonna ring and then I gonna shot you . Shit , I am sorry . Sorry . Hey ! You dropped this . Wow , thanks . All aboard . Doors are closing . Shit , no , no ! No ! Come on ! Stop the train ! Hey ! Hey ! Derek Frost - Yes ? - See this ? - Yes - Recognize it ? - No - Jesus . - How about you give me your wallet ? - Ok No , you left it on the train deliberately . I ... must dropped it . No , you planted it there , so everybody would think you were dead . I know , it 's you . - How do you know so much ? - Hell is that thing ? Wow , wow , wow. wow , wow . Slow down , slow down . Do you wanna see it ? - Very patriotic - Slowly , slowly ! All right , all right . Back up , back up ! Back up ! Not many people could build that . Alright , where is your next target ? Shawn ? Shawn Fentress . Teacher . History . I don 't know you . I think I killed your girlfriend . Why ? Oh , you messed up my timing . Why ! ? Oh , you mean why this . Because the world is hell . But we have a chance to start over in the rubble but first there has to be rubble You are teacher . You ... .. will understand . Christina ... Stay with me ! Stay with me ! Everything is gonna be ok . This isn 't the end . Check through there I 'll go check this way . This is Beleaguered Castle . Captain , this is Beleaguered Castle . Acknowledge transmission . Captain Stevens , this is Beleaguered Castle , acknowledge transmission . I have your bomber , I have his name . You have the bomber 's name ? Derek Frost . He got into a rented white van in the Glenbrook Station parking lot . Illinois plate , 5CGY847 Illinois plate , 5CGY847 All right , let 's move . And Goodwin ... .. and Goodwin , there is a radioactive device in the van some kind of bomb . Thank you , Captain . - Yes , Ma 'm - Thank you , Captain . You now off the clock . - About our deal ? - I had hoped that you might reconsider that for the sake of the program . I have , I want something else now . Good . I ... . I still wanna die , but I wanna go back in and I wanna save all those people on that train first . It doesn 't work that way , it can 't . - No , I know , I know , I know ... . - I am not really asking to believe me , sir . I am just .. I am asking to have the decency to let me try . CPD2 this is AS11 Van is approaching fens cape to the quarry , over . Roger that , AS11 . We 're on the vehicle , that into the quarry road . We 'll stop him about half way down , over . AU-SWAT2 , this is CPD2 , block the east end of the road , over . AU-Swat2 , roger that . We are going to switch now to a live feed from our Chicago affiliate . The swat team is approaching the white van . An Illinois man has been sorted through this morning ... The door is op ... the door is open and the man is on the ground . It appears he has surrendered . Earlier today the police discovered a ... .. - Congratulations , Captain. - ... .. lab in the backyard shack .. In recent months Frost started posting anti-government statements on his website . Yes Sir , it 's a real validation of the program a clear window into just how revolutionary Source Code can be . We finally have a powerful weapon now in the war on terror . Congratulations Captain , job well done . He is not gonna send me back in , is he , Goodwin ? I am still waiting an answer .

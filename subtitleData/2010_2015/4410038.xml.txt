 Are you the guys from Washington ? You get many other visitors out here ? How long you been on-site ? Since this morning . A Russian oil team called it in about 18 hours ago . How come nobody spotted it before ? It 's really not that surprising . This landscape 's changing all the time . You got any idea what this thing is exactly ? I don 't know . It 's probably a weather balloon . I don 't think so . we don 't have the equipment for a job like this . How long before we can start craning it out ? I don 't think you quite understand . You guys are gonna need one hell of a crane . we 're in . What is this ? Careful . Lieutenant ! What is it ? My God . get me a line to the Colonel . sir . I don 't care what time it is . This one 's waited long enough . Open it ! before he ... It has taken me a Iong time to find this place . You should be commended . help him up . I think that you are a man of great vision . we are much alike . I am nothing like you . but you and I know to be a science . What you seek is just a legend . Then why make such an effort to conceal it ? The Tesseract was the jewel of Odin 's treasure room . It is not something one buries . yes ? I cannot help you . No . But maybe you can help your village . perhaps ? I have no need for them to die . YggdrasiI . Tree of the world . Guardian of wisdom . also . And the FÃ¼hrer digs for trinkets in the desert . have you ? It 's not for the eyes of ordinary men . exactly . Give the order to open fire . fool ! You cannot control the power you hold . You will burn ! I already have . Michael . Henry . a Iot of guys getting killed over there . Steven . huh ? Nope . Rogers . - What did your father die of ? - Mustard gas . He was in the 107th Infantry . I was hoping I couId be assigned ... - Your mother ? - She was a nurse in a TB ward . Got hit . CouIdn 't shake it . just give me a chance . You 'd be ineligible on your asthma alone . Is there anything you can do ? I 'm doing it . I 'm saving your life . War continues to ravage Europe . But help is on the way . Every able-bodied young man is lining up to serve his country . Even little Timmy is doing his part collecting scrap metal . Timmy ! Who cares ? play the movie already ! you wanna show some respect ? our brave boys are showing the Axis powers that the price of freedom is never too high . Let 's go ! Get on with it ! just start the cartoon ! you wanna shut up ? no matter the size . do you ? I can do this all day . Hey ! Pick on someone your own size . Sometimes I think you Iike getting punched . I had him on the ropes . How many times is this ? You 're from Paramus now ? You know it 's illegal to lie on the enlistment form . Jersey ? You get your orders ? The 107th . shipping out for england first thing tomorrow . I should be going . man . My last night ! I got to get you cleaned up . Why ? Where are we going ? The future . I don 't see what the problem is . You 're about to be the Iast eligible man in New York . You know there 's three and a half million women here ? I 'd settle for just one . Good thing I took care of that . Bucky ! What 'd you tell her about me ? only the good stuff . Welcome to the Modern Marvels Pavilion and the World of Tomorrow . A greater world . A better world . my God ! It 's starting ! Mr. Howard Stark ! Howard ! your automobile won 't even have to touch the ground at all ? Mandy . With Stark Gravitic Reversion Technology you 'll be able to do just that . holy cow . didn 't I ? what do you say we treat these girls ... soldier . Come on . You 're kind of missing the point of a double date . We 're taking the girls dancing . You go ahead . I 'II catch up with you . You 're really going to do this again ? it 's a fair . I 'm gonna try my luck . Steve from Ohio ? they 'II actually take you . I know you don 't think I can do this . Steve . It 's war . - I know it 's a war . - Why are you so keen to fight ? - There are so many important jobs . - What do you want me to do ? collect scrap metal in my little red wagon ? Bucky . come on . There are men laying down their lives . I got no right to do any less than them . That 's what you don 't understand . This isn 't about me . Right . ' Cause you got nothing to prove . Sarge ! Are we going dancing ? we are . Don 't do anything stupid until I get back . How can I ? You 're taking all the stupid with you . - You 're a punk . - Jerk . Be careful . Don 't win the war till I get there ! girls . They 're playing our song . Wait here . - Is there a problem ? - Just wait here . Thank you . you want to go overseas . kill some Nazis . Excuse me ? Dr. Abraham Erskine . I represent the Strategic Scientific Reserve . Steve Rogers . Where are you from ? Queens . 73rd Street and Utopia Parkway . Germany . - This troubles you ? - No . Mr. Rogers ? Is it New Haven ? Or Paramus ? Five exams in five different cities . That might not be the right file . it 's not the exams I 'm interested in . It 's the five tries . But you didn 't answer my question . Do you want to kill Nazis ? Is this a test ? Yes . I don 't want to kill anyone . I don 't like bullies . I don 't care where they 're from . there are already so many big men fighting this war . Maybe what we need now is a little guy . I can offer you a chance . only a chance . - I 'II take it . - Good . So where is the little guy from ? actually ? brooklyn . soldier . Dr. ZoIa ? My machine requires the most delicate calibration . Forgive me if I seem overcautious . Are you certain that those conductors of yours can withstand the energy surge long enough for transference ? With this artifact I am certain of nothing . I fear it may not work at all . Twenty percent . Forty . Sixty . stabilizing at 70 % . Doctor . What was that ? Arnim . Your designs do not disappoint . Though they may require some slight reinforcement . The exchange is stable . Amazing ! The energy we have just collected could power my designs . AII my designs . This will change the war . this will change the world . exercise ! attention ! I am Agent Carter . I supervise all operations for this division . Queen Victoria ? I thought I was signing up for the U.S. Army . soldier ? Your Majesty . Hodge . Put your right foot forward . We gonna wrassIe ? 'Cause I got a few moves I know you 'II like . Agent Carter ! colonel phillips . I can see that you are breaking in the candidates . That 's good ! Get your ass up out of that dirt and stand in that line at attention till somebody comes tells you what to do . sir ! general Patton has said but they are won by men . We are going to win this war because we have the best men . And because they are going to get better . Much better . The Strategic Scientific Reserve is an Allied effort made up of the best minds in the free world . Our goal is to create the best army in history . But every army starts with one man . Rogers ! Get off of there ! we will choose that man . He will be the first in a new breed of super-soIdier . Rogers ! Get that rifle out of the mud ! And they will personally escort adolf hitler to the gates of hell . ladies ! let 's go ! double time ! Come on ! Faster ! Faster ! Move ! Move ! halt ! That flag means we 're only at the halfway point . First man to bring it to me gets a ride back with Agent Carter . move ! Come on ! Get up there ! this army 's in trouble ! Hodge ! Come on ! Get up there ! Nobody 's got that flag in 1 7 years ! fall in ! Let 's go ! Get back into formation ! Rogers ! I said fail in ! sir . ladies ! Come on . God rest her soul . Move it ! are you ? I 'm more than just thinking about it . He is the clear choice . " What the hell . " like a gerbil . I never thought you 'd pick him . Up . it 's gonna go right through him . girls . - Look at that . He 's making me cry . I am looking for qualities beyond the physical . Do you know how long it took to set up this project ? AII the groveling I had to do in front of Senator What 's-His-Name 's committees ? I know . I am well aware of your efforts . Then throw me a bone . Hodge passed every test we gave him . he 's fast . He obeys orders . - He 's a soldier . - He is a bully . Doctor . You win wars with guts . Grenade ! Get away ! Get back ! It was a dummy grenade . AII clear . Back in formation . Is this a test ? He 's still skinny . - May I ? - Yeah . Can 't sleep ? I guess . too . Can I ask you a question ? Just one ? Why me ? I suppose that is the only question that matters . This is from Augsburg . My city . So many people forget that the first country the Nazis invaded was their own . my people struggled . They felt weak . They felt small . And then HitIer comes along with the marching and the big show and the flags . And he hears of me . My work . And he finds me . " You . " " You will make us strong . " I am not interested . his research division . A brilliant scientist by the name of Johann Schmidt . Schmidt is a member of the inner circle . And he is ambitious . He and Hitler share a passion for occult power and Teutonic myth . hitler uses his fantasies to inspire his followers . it is not fantasy . it is real . He has become convinced waiting to be seized by a superior man . he cannot resist . Schmidt must become that superior man . Did it make him stronger ? Yes . But there were other effects . The serum was not ready . the man . so good becomes great . Bad becomes worse . This is why you were chosen . Because a strong man who has known power all his life but a weak man knows the value of strength . And knows compassion . Thanks . I think . you must promise me one thing . That you will stay who you are . but a good man . To the little guys . wait . What I am doing ? you have procedure tomorrow . No fluids . AII right . We 'II drink it after . I don 't have procedure tomorrow . Drink it after ? I drink it now . Is there something in particular you need ? I understand you found him . See for yourself . You disapprove . I just don 't see why you need concern yourself . I can 't imagine he will succeed . Again . His serum is the allies ' only defense against this power we now possess . then our victory is assured . shall I give the order ? It has been given . Good . Dr. ZoIa ! What do you think ? A masterpiece . I know this neighborhood . I got beat up in that alley . And that parking lot . And behind that diner . Did you have something against running away ? they 'II never let you stop . you push back . right ? to have every door shut in your face . I guess I just don 't know why you 'd want to join the Army if you were a beautiful dame . Or a ... A woman . An agent . Not a dame . but ... do you ? I think this is the longest conversation I 've had with one . Women aren 't exactly lining up to dance with a guy they might step on . You must have danced . asking a woman to dance always seemed so terrifying . it just didn 't seem to matter that much . I figured I 'd wait . For what ? The right partner . This way . - What are we doing here ? - follow me . isn 't it ? but I always carry an umbrella . Good morning . not now . Are you ready ? and your hat . glad you could make it . Why exactly am I in brooklyn ? We needed access to the city 's power grid . if you 'd given me the generators I requisitioned ... colonel . This is ... State Department . we 'd Iike to see it used for something other than headlines . Jesus . Somebody get that kid a sandwich . comfortable ? It 's a little big . You save me any of that schnapps ? Not as much as I should have . Sorry . Next time . how are your levels ? - levels at 100 % . - Good . but we are ready as we 'II ever be . Agent Carter ? Don 't you think you would be more comfortable in the booth ? of course . Sorry . - Good . Do you hear me ? is this on ? but the first step on the path to peace . We begin with a series of microinjections into the subject 's major muscle groups . The serum infusion will cause immediate cellular change . the subject will be saturated with Vita-Rays . That wasn 't so bad . That was penicillin . Serum infusion beginning in one . Mr. Stark . Steven ? Can you hear me ? right ? We will proceed . That 's 10 % . Twenty percent . Thirty . That 's 40 % . vital signs are normal . That 's 50 % . Sixty . Seventy . Steven ! - Steven ! - Shut it down ! Shut it down ! Mr. Stark ! Turn it off ! kill it ! kill the reactor ! No ! Don 't ! I can do this ! Eighty . Ninety . That 's 100 % . Mr. Stark ? Steven . Steven . The son of a bitch did it . yeah . I think we did it . You actually did it . How do you feel ? taller . You look taller . Senator ? I can think of some folks in berlin who are about to get very nervous . Doctor . sir . Stop him ! are you all right ? this guy 's been shot ! I had him ! Sorry ! I 'm sorry ! No ! No ! Not my son ! - Stop it ! - Don 't hurt him ! Get back ! Let me go ! Let go of my son ! Don 't hurt him ! don 't ! Don 't ! No ! Don 't ! Go get him ! I can swim ! - Who the hell are you ? - The first of many . two more shall take its place . hall Hydra . Herr Schmidt . He funds your research because you promised him weapons . You serve at his pleasure . He gave you this facility as a reward for your injuries . Reward ? call it what it is . exile . I no Ionger reflect his image of Aryan perfection . You think this is about appearances ? Your Hydra division has failed to deliver so much as a rifle in over a year . And we had learned through local intelligence you had mounted a fuII-scaIe incursion into Norway . The FÃ¼hrer feels ... How does he put it ? " The Red skull has been indulged long enough ! " you have come to see the results of our work . Let me show you . but he cannot feed his armies for a month . but still he is no closer to achieving his goals . And I suppose you still aim to win this war through magic ? Science . But I understand your confusion . Great power has always baffled primitive men . all in a matter of hours . Your enemies ? My weapons contain enough destructive power to decimate every hostile capital on Earth . I have harnessed the power of the gods . Schmidt . For what ? For making it clear how obviously mad you are . berlin is on this map ! So it is . You will be punished for your insolence ! You will be brought before the FÃ¼hrer himself ! Schmidt ... but we both knew Hydra could grow no further in hitler 's shadow . hall Hydra . hall Hydra ! hall Hydra ! Think you got enough ? Any hope of reproducing the program is locked in your genetic code . it wouId take years . He deserved more than this . he 'd be proud it was you . my committee is demanding answers . Great . Why don 't we start with how a German spy got a ride to my secret installation in your car ? What have we got here ? I 'm the best mechanical engineer in this country . But I don 't know what 's inside this thing or how it works . We 're not even close to this technology . - Then who is ? - Hydra . I 'm sure you 've been reading our briefings . colonel . Hydra is the Nazi deep-science division . It 's led by Johann Schmidt . But he has much bigger ambitions . Hydra is practically a cult . They worship Schmidt . They think he 's invincible . what are you going to do about it ? I spoke to the President this morning . the SSR is being retasked . - colonel ? Agent Carter . Stark . We 're flying to London tonight . I want in . You 're an experiment . You 're going to AIamogordo . The serum worked . I asked for an army and all I got was you . You are not enough . I think we may be missing the point . the country 's seen it . Paper . The enlistment lines have been around the block since your picture hit the newsstands . and hide him in a lab . do you want to serve your country on the most important battlefield of the war ? that 's all I want . congratulations . You just got promoted . I don 't know if I can do this . Nothing to it . You sell a few bonds . Bonds buy bullets . bullets kill Nazis . You 're an American hero . It 's just not how I pictured getting there . The Senator has got a Iot of pull up on the hill . you 'II be leading your own platoon in no time . Take the shield . Go . Who 's strong and brave Here to save the American way ? Not all of us can storm a beach or drive a tank . But there 's still a way all of us can fight . night and day ? Series E Defense Bonds . Each one you buy is a bullet in the barrel of your best guy 's gun . Who will campaign door-to-door for America ? Carry the flag shore to shore for America ? From Hoboken to Spokane The star-spangled man with a plan don 't look at the camera . We can 't ignore there 's a threat and a war we must win Each one you buy is a bullet in the barrel of your best guy 's gun . Who 'll hang a noose on the goose-stepping goons from Berlin ? Who will redeem Heed the call for America ? Who 'll rise or fall Give his all for America ? Who 's here to prove that we can ? The star-spangled man with a plan We all know this is about trying to win the war . tanks and tents . That 's where you come in . Every bond you buy will help protect someone you love . and the Germans will think twice about trying to get the drop on us . Stalwart and steady and true Forceful and ready to defend and blue Who 'll give the Axis the sack and is smart as a fox ? Who 'll give the Axis the sack and is smart as a fox ? Far as an eagle will soar Who 's making Adolf afraid to step out of his box ? He knows what we 're fighting for Who waked the giant that napped in America ? We know it 's no one but Captain America Hi . Who 'll finish what they began ? Who 'll kick the Krauts to Japan ? The star-spangled man with a plan ! How many of you are ready to help me sock old Adolf on the jaw ? Okay . I need a volunteer . I already volunteered ! How do you think I got here ? Bring back the girls ! but I 'll see what I can do . sweetheart . Tinker bell ! we 're all on the same team here . Captain ! Sign this ! Bring back the girls ! pal . They 'II warm up to you . Don 't worry . Steve . Hi . - Hi . - What are you doing here ? I 'm not here at all . That was quite a performance . Yeah . I had to improvise a little bit . The crowds I 'm used to are usually more twelve . I understand you 're " America 's New Hope . " Bond sales take a 10 % bump in every state I visit . Is that Senator Brandt I hear ? At least he 's got me doing this . phillips would have had me stuck in a lab . And these are your only two options ? A lab rat or a dancing monkey ? you know . What ? I dreamed about serving my country . I finally got everything I wanted and I 'm wearing tights . They look like they 've been through hell . These men more than most . and less than 50 returned . Your audience contained what was left of the 107th . The rest were killed or captured . The 107th ? What ? Come on . colonel phillips . if it isn 't the Star-SpangIed Man With A plan . What 's your plan today ? I need the casualty list from Azzano . son . Sergeant James Barnes from the 107th . You and I are gonna have a conversation later that you won 't enjoy . sir . B-A-R ... - I can spell . I have signed more of these condoIence letters today than I would care to count . But the name does sound familiar . I 'm sorry . What about the others ? Are you planning a rescue mission ? it 's called " winning the war . " why not at Ieast ... They 're 30 miles behind the lines through some of the most heavily fortified territory in Europe . We 'd lose more men than we 'd save . But I don 't expect you to understand that because you 're a chorus girl . I think I understand just fine . then understand it somewhere else . you got someplace to be in 30 minutes . sir . I do . right now is the perfect time to keep it to yourself . walk to Austria ? If that 's what it takes . You heard the colonel . Your friend is most likely dead . You don 't know that . he 's devising a strategy . If he detects ... it could be too late . Steve ! You told me you thought I was meant for more than this . Did you mean that ? Every word . Then you got to let me go . I can do more than that . girls . Five minutes ! Where 's my helmet ? Anyone seen Rogers ? tucked between these two mountain ranges . It 's a factory of some kind . We should be able to drop you right on the doorstep . Just get me as close as you can . You two are gonna be in a Iot of trouble when you land . And you won 't ? I can just shoot them . They will undoubtedly shoot back . let 's hope it 's good for something . Agent Carter ? I thought we could stop off in Lucerne for a Iate-night fondue . Stark is the best civilian pilot I 've ever seen . He 's mad enough to brave this airspace . We 're lucky to have him . are you two ... Do you fondue ? This is your transponder . Activate it when you 're ready and the signal will lead us straight to you . Are you sure this thing works ? pal . Get back here ! We 're taking you all the way in ! you turn this thing around and get the hell out of here ! You can 't give me orders ! The hell I can 't ! I 'm a Captain ! even with components of this size . Increase the output by 60 % and see to it our other facilities do the same . I 'm not sure they have the strength . Doctor . There are always more workers . Not now ! I 'm gonna have a stick of my own . FeIIas . Who are you supposed to be ? I 'm Captain America . I beg your pardon ? are we taking everybody ? Ace . Is there anybody else ? I 'm looking for a Sergeant James Barnes . but no one 's ever come back from it . AII right . 80 yards past the gate . Get out fast and give ' em hell . I 'II meet you guys in the clearing with anybody else I find . Wait . You know what you 're doing ? Yeah . I 've knocked out adolf hitler over 200 times . You know how to use that thing ? Okay . What is happening ? Hey . Not exactly a Buick . - That one . " ZÃ¼ndung . " - ZÃ¼ndung ? Dugan ! I didn 't know you spoke German . girls much cuter . Didn 't ask for the resume . - On your left ! - Up top ! no ! What are you doing ? Our forces are outmatched . Keep moving ! Grab those grenades ! Sergeant . Three-two-five-five-seven . Bucky ? my God . - Is that ... - It 's me . - It 's Steve . - Steve ? - Come on . - Steve . I thought you were dead . I thought you were smaller . Come on . - What happened to you ? - I joined the Army . - Did it hurt ? - A little . Is this permanent ? So far . Captain America ! How exciting ! I am a great fan of your films ! Dr. Erskine managed it after all . impressive . You 've got no idea . Haven 't I ? I was his greatest success ! do you ? Captain . you are just afraid to admit that we have left humanity behind . I embrace it proudly . Without fear ! Then how come you 're running ? let 's go . Up . Sir ? Are we going to the roof ? What about me ? Where will I sit ? Doctor . Not a scratch . Let 's go . One at a time . - Gotta be a rope or something ! - Just go ! Get out of here ! No ! Not without you ! hell . I regret to report that Captain Steven G. Rogers went missing behind enemy lines on the third . aerial reconnaissance has proven unfruitfuI . I must declare Captain Rogers killed in action . Period . The last surveillance flight is back . No sign of activity . sir . I can 't touch Stark . He 's rich and he 's the Army 's number one weapons contractor . You are neither one . I don 't regret my actions . either . What makes you think I give a damn about your opinions ? Agent Carter . And now America 's golden boy and a Iot of other good men are dead 'cause you had a crush . It wasn 't that . I had faith . I hope that 's a big comfort to you when they shut this division down . What the hell 's going on out there ? Look who it is ! Some of these men need medical attention . we got wounded . - Right over here . I 'd Iike to surrender myself for disciplinary action . That won 't be necessary . sir . huh ? You 're late . CouIdn 't call my ride . Hey ! Let 's hear it for Captain America ! I am honored to present this medal for valor Captain America ! Captain America ! that 's your cue ! I thought he 'd be taller . right near the baltic . And the sixth one was 40 miles west of the Maginot Line . I just got a quick look . nobody 's perfect . These are the weapon factories we know about . Sergeant Barnes said that Hydra shipped all the parts to another facility that isn 't on this map . coordinate with MI6 . I want every allied eyeball looking for that main Hydra base . What about us ? We are going to set a fire under Johann Schmidt 's ass . Rogers ? It 's your map . sir . I 'II need a team . We 're already putting together the best men . so am I. let 's get this straight . and you want us to go back ? Pretty much . actually . I 'm in . We 're in . I 'II always fight . But you got to do one thing for me . What 's that ? Open a tab . that was easy . - Another round . - Where are they putting all this stuff ? See ? I told you . They 're all idiots . How about you ? You ready to follow Captain America into the jaws of death ? no . That little guy from brooklyn who was too dumb not to run away from a fight . I 'm following him . right ? You know what ? It 's kind of growing on me . - Captain . - Agent Carter . Ma 'am . Howard has some equipment for you to try . Tomorrow morning ? Sounds good . I see your top squad is prepping for duty . You don 't like music ? actually . go dancing . Then what are we waiting for ? The right partner . Captain . ma 'am . I 'II be there . I 'm invisible . I 'm turning into you . It 's like a horrible dream . Don 't take it so hard . Maybe she 's got a friend . Emission signature is unusual . alpha and beta ray neutral . Though I doubt Rogers picked up on that . Seems harmless enough . Hard to see what all the fuss is about . Write that down . Excuse me . I 'm looking for Mr. Stark . He 's in with colonel phillips . you 're welcome to wait . I read about what you did . the ... Yeah . you know . Just doing what needed to be done . Sounded like more than that . You saved nearly 400 men . it 's not a big deal . tell that to their wives . I don 't think they were all married . You 're a hero . really . they owe you their thanks . And seeing as they 're not here ... Captain ! if you 're not otherwise occupied . wait . Looks like finding a partner wasn 't that hard after all . that 's not what you thought it was . not one thing . just like all the rest . what about you and Stark ? How do I know you two haven 't been fondue-ing ? You still don 't know a bloody thing about women . my friend . pal . The moment you think you know what 's going on in a woman 's head is the moment your goose is well and truly cooked . which at the moment is about making sure you and your men do not get killed . Carbon polymer . should withstand your average German bayonet . although Hydra 's not going to attack you with a pocket knife . I hear you 're kind of attached . It 's handier than you might think . I took the liberty of coming up with some options . This one 's fun . She 's been fitted with electrical relays that allow you to ... that 's just a prototype . - What 's it made of ? - Vibranium . It 's stronger than steel and a third the weight . It 's completely vibration absorbent . How come it 's not standard issue ? That 's the rarest metal on Earth . that 's all we 've got . Mr. Stark ? I 'm sure the Captain has some unfinished business . What do you think ? I think it works . I had some ideas about the uniform . pal . You are falling ! yet we are continually delayed because you cannot outwit a simpleton with a shield ! This is hardly my area of expertise . I merely developed the weapons . I cannot fire them . before the American finishes his . Sir ! Herr Schmidt . We fought to the Iast man . evidently not . Remember when I made you ride the cyclone at Coney island ? and I threw up ? is it ? Now why would I do that ? We were right . Dr. ZoIa 's on the train . Hydra dispatcher gave him permission to open up the throttle . they must need him bad . because they 're moving like the devil . We only got about a 10-second window . we 're bugs on a windshield . Mind the gap . bugs ! Stop him ! Fire again ! - I had him on the ropes . - I know you did . Get down ! Fire again ! Kill him ! Now ! Bucky ! Hang on ! Grab my hand ! Sit down . - What is this ? - Steak . What is in it ? Cow . do you realize how difficult it is to get ahold of a prime cut like that out here ? I don 't eat meat . Why not ? It disagrees with me . too ? Every Hydra agent that we 've tried to take alive has crunched a little pill before we can stop him . But not you . here is my brilliant theory . You want to live . colonel . I bought you dinner . " Given the valuable information he has provided " Dr. ZoIa is being remanded to switzerland " ? of course it was encoded . have you ? That would be awkward . Schmidt will know this is a lie . Doc . You 're a liability . You know more about Schmidt than anyone . so I wouldn 't count on the very best of protection . It 's you or Schmidt . It 's just the hand you 've been dealt . Schmidt believes he walks in the footsteps of the gods . only the world itself will satisfy him . don 't you ? What ? The sanity of the plan is of no consequence . - And why is that ? - Because he can do it ! What 's his target ? His target is everywhere . borne to victory on the wings of the Valkyrie . Our enemies ' weapons will be powerless against us . hundreds more will rain fire upon them ! two more shall take its place . hall Hydra . - hall Hydra ! - hall Hydra ! - hall Hydra ! hall Hydra ! - hall Hydra ! hall Hydra ! Blackout is still in effect throughout the London area . Please wait for the all-clear . please . All citizens shall remain indoors until further notice . Blackout is still in effect throughout the London area . Dr. Erskine said that it wouId affect my cells . Create a protective system of regeneration and healing . Which means I can 't get drunk . Did you know that ? Your metabolism burns four times faster than the average person . He thought it could be one of the side effects . It wasn 't your fault . - Did you read the report ? - Yes . Then you know that 's not true . You did everything you could . Did you believe in your friend ? Did you respect him ? Then stop blaming yourself . allow Barnes the dignity of his choice . He damn well must have thought you were worth it . I 'm going after Schmidt . I 'm not gonna stop until all of Hydra is dead or captured . You won 't be alone . starting with the USA . Schmidt 's working with powers beyond our capabilities . he will wipe out the entire Eastern Seaboard in an hour . How much time we got ? under 24 hours . - Where is he now ? - Hydra 's last base is here . 500 feet below the surface . So what are we supposed to do ? it 's not Iike we can just knock on the front door . Why not ? That 's exactly what we 're going to do . you do it better than anyone . But there are limits Captain . Or did Erskine tell you otherwise ? He told me you were insane . He resented my genius and tried to deny me what was rightfully mine . But he gave you everything . what made you so special ? Nothing . I 'm just a kid from brooklyn . I can do this all day . of course . I am on a tight schedule . So am I. Rogers ! You might need this ! Thanks ! go ! Move out ! Move ! Keep your spacing ! two more shall ... Let 's go find two more ! You 're late . - Weren 't you about to ... - Right . Get in ! - Keep it steady ! - Wait ! Go get him . I 'm not kissing you ! do you ? - Nope ! You could have the power of the gods ! Yet you wear a flag on your chest and think you fight a battle of nations ! Captain ! - There are no flags ! - Not my future ! What have you done ? No ! Come in . This is Captain Rogers . Do you read me ? what is your ... is that you ? Are you all right ? Schmidt 's dead ! What about the plane ? That 's a little bit tougher to explain . Give me your coordinates . I 'II find you a safe landing site . There 's not gonna be a safe landing . But I can try and force it down . I 'II get Howard on the line . He 'II know what to do . There 's not enough time . This thing 's moving too fast and it 's heading for New York . I got to put her in the water . don 't do this . We have time . We can work it out . Right now I 'm in the middle of nowhere . a Iot of people are gonna die . this is my choice . Peggy ? I 'm here . I 'm gonna need a rain check on that dance . AII right . at the Stork club . You got it . 8 : 00 on the dot . Don 't you dare be late . Understood ? I still don 't know how to dance . I 'II show you how . Just be there . We 'II have the band play something slow . I 'd hate to step on your ... Steve ? Steve ? Steve ? To the Captain . Sir ? Take us to the next grid point . But there 's no trace of wreckage . And the energy signature stops here . Just keep looking . high and outside for ball one . 4-4 . this fellow 's capable of making it a brand-new game again . Just an absolutely gorgeous day here at Ebbets Field . The Phillies have managed to tie it up at 4-4 . But the Dodgers have three men on . Pearson beaned Reiser in Philadelphia last month . Wouldn 't the youngster like a hit here to return the favor ? Pete leans in . Here 's the pitch . Swung on . A line to the right . And it gets past Rizzo . Three runs will score . Reiser heads to third . Durocher 's going to wave him in . but they won 't get him . Good morning . Or should I say afternoon ? Where am I ? You 're in a recovery room in New York City . Dodgers ! Everyone is on their feet . indeed . Where am I really ? I 'm afraid I don 't understand . The game . 'cause I was there . I 'm going to ask you again . Where am I ? - Captain Rogers ... - Who are you ? wait ! code 13 ! code 13 ! soldier ! but we thought it best to break it to you slowly . Break what ? Cap . For almost 70 years . You gonna be okay ? Yeah . I just ... I had a date . trouble sleeping ? sir ? I am . Trying to get me back in the world ? Trying to save it . You think you 're the only hero in the world ? gentlemen ? You 're up . Got a mean swing .

 Narrator : THERE ARE GLOBAL PHENOMENA THAT SCIENCE CANNOT EXPLAIN - - TRUE STORIES THAT DEFY RATIONAL EXPLANATION . IN SRI LANKA , A TROPICAL VILLAGE IS STAINED BY BLOOD-RED RAIN - - A FREAK MONSOON ? OR COULD EACH DROPLET HARBOR A DANGEROUS NEW LIFE-FORM , A CONTAGION FROM BEYOND OUR ATMOSPHERE ? Wickramasinghe : THERE COULD BE A PANDEMIC THAT MIGHT WIPE OUT THE WHOLE OF MANKIND . Narrator : ALONG THE COAST OF NORTH CAROLINA , MYSTERIOUS BOOMS SHATTER THE PEACE . DO THESE DEAFENING SOUNDS COME FROM DEEP INSIDE THE EARTH OR FROM FAR ABOVE IT ? YOU THINK AN EXPLOSION HAS TAKEN PLACE RIGHT NEARBY . Narrator : AND IN THE UNITED KINGDOM , A CRYPTIC MANUSCRIPT IS BROUGHT INTO THE LIGHT AFTER CENTURIES IN HIDING . Kennedy : THERE 'S SOMETHING PROFOUND ABOUT IT , BUT IT 'S JUST SO BIZARRE . EACH PAGE IS A RIDDLE WRITTEN IN AN ESOTERIC CODE THAT DEFIES LOGIC . A MEDIEVAL HOAX ? OR DO UNTAPPED SECRETS FROM ANOTHER WORLD LIE INSIDE ? NEW INVESTIGATIONS QUESTION UNEXPLAINED HAPPENINGS AND OTHERWORLDLY EVENTS . Woman : WHAT IS TH- - OH , MAN ! IT 'S HOVERING ! IT 'S NOT AN AIRCRAFT ! Narrator : FIRSTHAND TESTIMONY AND FRESH EVIDENCE BUILD NEW POSSIBILITIES . Man : NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN MY LIFE . AND IT JUST DISAPPEARED INTO THIN AIR . IT WASN 'T FROM THIS PLANET . MY ARMS WERE JUST ON FIRE . Narrator : RETHINK EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU KNOW . CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS [ THUNDER RUMBLES ] THE MONSOON SEASON DESCENDS ON THE VILLAGE OF SEVANAGALA IN EASTERN SRI LANKA ONCE AGAIN . THE RAIN IS TYPICALLY TORRENTIAL . BUT THIS YEAR , SOMETHING IS STRIKINGLY DIFFERENT . [ SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE ] [ SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE ] Narrator : COULD THIS BE A SIMPLE TRICK OF THE EYE - - LIGHT AND SHADOWS CREATING HUES THAT AREN 'T REALLY THERE ? Silawathi : [ SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE ] Narrator : FOR RESIDENTS OF SOUTH ASIA , MONSOON RAINS SIGNIFY LIFE AND RENEWAL , BUT THIS DOWNPOUR IS DIFFERENT . IT SUGGESTS BLOOD AND DEATH . Gurusinghe : [ SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE ] Narrator : THE DELUGE CONTINUES , OFF AND ON , FOR 60 TERRIFYING DAYS . PEOPLE BARRICADE THEMSELVES INSIDE AND WAIT FOR THE RED RAIN TO PASS . [ SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE ] Narrator : SOON , THE GOVERNMENT IS FORCED TO INTERVENE . WELL , A TEAM OF SIX SPECIALIST DOCTORS HAVE BEEN APPOINTED BY THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH TO INVESTIGATE THE RED RAIN EXPERIENCED IN THE SEVANAGALA AREA . Narrator : THEIR FIRST QUESTION - - HOW DANGEROUS IS THIS WATER ? IS IT SAFE TO DRINK OR EVEN GET ON YOUR SKIN ? INVESTIGATORS NEXT CHECK TO SEE IF THE STRANGE PHENOMENON IS HAPPENING ELSEWHERE . SIMILAR CASES ARE SOON DISCOVERED . IN 2009 , SYDNEY RESIDENTS AWAKE TO FIND AN AMBER FOG ENGULFING THEIR CITY . Man : HOW BIZARRE IS THIS ? Narrator : IT BLANKETS THE COAST FOR 375 MILES AND LINGERS FOR 48 HOURS . BUT THERE 'S ALSO AN EXPLANATION . THE COLOR IS DUE TO RICH , DENSE DUST BLOWN FROM DRAUGHT-AFFECTED DESERTS INLAND . IN 2001 IN KERALA , SOUTHERN INDIA , MUDDY RED RAINFALLS FOR TWO MONTHS . FINE DUST ONCE AGAIN SEEMS TO BE THE CULPRIT - - THIS TIME FROM THE ARABIAN DESERT . IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE SRI LANKAN RED RAIN IS NOTHING MORE THAN HARMLESS DESERT DUST ? INDIAN PHYSICIST PROFESSOR GODFREY LOUIS ANALYZES SAMPLES OF THE RAIN TO FIND OUT . Louis : IT 'S VERY CLEAR FROM THE IMAGES THAT THEY ARE NOT DUST PARTICLES . DUST PARTICLES WILL NOT HAVE THIS REGULAR SHAPE . THEY WILL NOT BE SMALL BALLS LIKE THIS , AND THEY 'RE NOT TRANSPARENT LIKE THIS . Narrator : PROFESSOR LOUIS DISCOVERS SOMETHING FAR MORE MYSTIFYING THAN DUST . IN HIS EYES , THESE PARTICLES APPEAR TO BE ALIVE . Louis : YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY HAVE A THICK CELL WALL WITH RED COLOR . THERE IS SOME MATERIAL INSIDE THE CELL , SO IT IS VERY CONVINCING THAT THEY ARE BIOLOGICAL CELLS . Narrator : SO , WHAT ARE THESE FOREIGN CELLS ? AND IS IT POSSIBLE FOR LIVING CELLS TO SOMEHOW GET INTO THE RAIN ? A RED RAINFALL IN COLOMBIA , SOUTH AMERICA , IN 2008 MAY PROVIDE THE ANSWER . [ SPEAKING SPANISH ] [ SPEAKING SPANISH ] Narrator : A LOCAL SCIENTIST ASSERTS THE RAIN REALLY DID CONTAIN BLOOD . [ SPEAKING SPANISH ] Narrator : COULD THE RED-RAIN PLAGUE IN COLOMBIA , INDIA , AND SRI LANKA ACTUALLY CONTAIN BLOOD ? AND IF SO , WHERE DID IT COME FROM ? Man : WHOA ! LOOK AT THAT ! IT 'S KNOWN THAT FROGS AND FISH CAN BE SUCKED UP FROM THE SEA BY TORNADOS AND FALL BACK TO THE EARTH WITH RAIN . FISH RAIN IS ACTUALLY RECORDED IN SRI LANKA A MONTH AFTER THE RED RAIN IN 2012 . BUT COULD THE BLOOD CELLS OF THESE ANIMALS DISSOLVE WITHIN THE CLOUDS AND FALL AS BLOOD RAIN ? WHEN PROFESSOR LOUIS EXAMINES THE LIFE-FORMS IN BOTH THE INDIAN AND SRI LANKAN RAIN , HE DETERMINES THAT THE CELLULAR STRUCTURE HAS VERY LITTLE IN COMMON WITH BLOOD . THE BLOOD CELLS AND THE RED-RAIN CELLS MAY HAVE SOME SUPERFICIAL SIMILARITY , BUT THIS IS THE IMAGE OF THE RED CELL CROSS SECTION , AND YOU CAN SEE A VERY THICK CELL WALL AND , AT THE SAME TIME , IF YOU LOOK AT THE RED BLOOD CELLS , THEY DON 'T HAVE THIS KIND OF A CELL WALL , SO STILL , THE CELLS REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED . Narrator : SCIENTISTS ARE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY THE CELLS FOUND IN THE RAINWATER . FIRST DUST AND THEN BLOOD HAS BEEN RULED OUT . NOW INVESTIGATORS AT SLINTEC , ONE OF SRI LANKA 'S MOST STATE-OF-THE-ART LABS , BECOME INVOLVED . THEY PLAN TO TEST AN ALTERNATIVE THEORY . COULD PIGMENTATION FROM ALGAE SPORES BE TO BLAME ? CYCLONES AND TORNADOS MAY HAVE SUCKED UP ALGAE INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AS THEY TEAR ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE . IF IT 'S NOT ALGAE , THEN WHAT IS IT ? AND CAN IT REALLY BE ALIVE ? PROFESSOR DE SILVA SETS OUT TO TEST IF THE RAIN IS CARRYING THE GENETIC CODE PRESENT IN ALL KNOWN LIFE - - DNA . DNA IS THE ESSENTIAL BUILDING BLOCK FOR ALL LIFE ON EARTH . IT ALLOWS CELLS TO REPLICATE . BUT PROFESSOR LOUIS DISCOVERS THESE CELLS ARE REPLICATING WITHOUT DNA . THESE CELLS MULTIPLY , SO THE BIOCHEMISTRY OF THIS ORGANISM IS DIFFERENT . IT IS A NEW KIND OF LIFE-FORM . THIS IS SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY . WE ARE DEALING WITH AN ORGANISM WHICH HAS COME FROM SPACE . Narrator : SCIENTISTS INVESTIGATING A SERIES OF UNEXPLAINED RED RAINFALLS MAKE A STARTLING DISCOVERY . WHATEVER IS IN THE RAIN IS REPLICATING EVEN THOUGH IT HAS NO DNA . MORE PUZZLING - - IT 'S DOING SO IN CONDITIONS THAT WOULD KILL ALL OTHER KNOWN LIFE-FORMS . I HAVE HEATED THESE CELLS FOR 15 HOURS AT 300 DEGREES CENTIGRADE . THAT WOULD KILL ANY NORMAL ORGANISM . WE FOUND , TO OUR SURPRISE , THAT THEY DON 'T JUST SURVIVE - - THEY 'RE GROWING HAPPILY AT THAT TEMPERATURE . Narrator : PROFESSOR LOUIS ' EXAMINATION OF THE RED-RAIN CELLS LEADS HIM TO AN UNORTHODOX CONCLUSION . THIS IS POTENTIALLY AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL ORGANISM . Narrator : COULD THESE TINY CELLS BE ALIEN LIFE ? PROFESSOR CHANDRA WICKRAMASINGHE IS ONE OF THE WORLD 'S LEADING ASTROBIOLOGISTS . HE 'S A CONSULTANT FOR THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY AND IS AN OUTSPOKEN ADVOCATE ON THE POSSIBILITY OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE . THE EXISTENCE OF LIFE OUTSIDE THE EARTH IS AMAZINGLY REGARDED AS AN EXTRAORDINARY HYPOTHESIS . BUT I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE EXTRAORDINARY HYPOTHESIS IS TO SAY THAT THIS TINY , MINUTE BIT OF DUST THAT WE CALL THE EARTH IS THE CENTER OF LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE AND THAT NO LIFE EXISTS EVEN NEXT DOOR TO IT . Narrator : FOR THE PAST 40 YEARS , HE 'S BEEN TEACHING AT BRITISH UNIVERSITIES , BUT HE 'S VISITING HIS NATIVE SRI LANKA TO HELP INVESTIGATE WHETHER THE RED RAIN COULD BE HARBORING ALIEN LIFE-FORMS . HOW DID YOU COLLECT THE RAIN ? YOU COLLECTED SOME ? YEAH . I COLLECTED THAT BASKET . IN THAT BUCKET THERE ? OKAY . THIS WAS A SAMPLE ? YEAH , A SAMPLE . OH , MY GOD . THIS IS REALLY RED , ISN 'T IT ? AND THAT BUCKET WAS FULL OF THIS RED RAIN - - RED-COLORED LIQUID ? THAT 'S AMAZING . [ HORNS HONKING ] HE SUSPECTS THERE MAY BE A CONNECTION TO A MYSTERIOUS EVENT THAT OCCURRED ONE WEEK BEFORE THE RED RAIN FELL . Man : WHAT ARE THESE UNIDENTIFIED LIGHTS ? Woman : SRI LANKA AIR FORCE STATES THAT IT IS KEEPING A 24-HOUR VIGIL REGARDING THE UNIDENTIFIED LIGHTS THAT WERE WITNESSED IN THE SKIES OVER SEVERAL PARTS OF THE ISLAND . Narrator : CHANDRA TRACKS DOWN AN EYEWITNESS WHO REPORTED SEEING THE PECULIAR LIGHTS . Banda : [ SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE ] Narrator : TAIKIRI BANDA CLAIMS TO HAVE SEEN THE LIGHTS CRASH TO EARTH . THE NEXT DAY , HE DISCOVERS OBSCURE DEBRIS IN HIS FIELD . THIS IS A LARGE PIECE . DID YOU FIND MANY LARGE PIECES ? OH , YES . YES . YOU SAW THE FIREBALL , AND YOU SAW THIS ACTUALLY FALLING FROM THE SKIES ? YES . THAT 'S VERY SIGNIFICANT . CHANDRA 'S NOW CONVINCED HE KNOWS WHAT FELL TO EARTH THAT NIGHT . ON THAT EVIDENCE ALONE , I THINK ONE HAS TO SAY THAT IT IS A METEORITE . EVERY YEAR , SOME 30,000 METEORITES HIT THE EARTH . NO ONE HAS EVER FOUND LIVING CELLS ON THESE SPACE ROCKS , BUT CHANDRA BELIEVES HE 'S ON THE BRINK OF A NEW DISCOVERY . Wickramasinghe : I THINK THE CELLS IN THIS RED-RAIN SAMPLE MAY WELL HAVE COME FROM THE METEORITE . Narrator : BACK IN BRITAIN , CHANDRA BRINGS TOGETHER THE RAINWATER SAMPLE AND METEORITE FRAGMENTS . BOTH FELL TO EARTH IN THE SAME PLACE AND JUST A WEEK APART . COULD THE METEORITE BE HOSTING THE SAME CELLS AS THE RAIN ? TO FIND OUT , CHANDRA USES A SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE 100 TIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN A CONVENTIONAL ONE . [ SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ] IF I FOCUS IN HERE , WE SHOULD SEE ... TRYING TO LOCATE THE TINY CELLS JUST 1 / 8,000 OF A MILLIMETER ACROSS IS A PAINSTAKING TASK . IS THERE ANY ONE YOU 'D LIKE TO - - HOW ABOUT THIS ONE HERE ? THIS RIGHT IN HERE . OKAY . SHOULD WE ZOOM IN ON THAT ONE ? AS THEY SEARCH DEEP INSIDE THE METEOR ROCK , CHANDRA SPOTS SOMETHING . THAT 'S A POTENTIAL RED RAIN THERE . IT 'S A WHOLE FIELD OF SPHERICAL CARBON STRUCTURES THAT LOOK LIKE RED-RAIN CELLS . I THINK THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING DISCOVERY THAT WE MADE RIGHT NOW , HERE . Narrator : CHANDRA BELIEVES HE 'S IDENTIFIED THE SAME MYSTERIOUS CELLS FOUND IN THE RED RAIN INSIDE THE METEORITE . Wickramasinghe : WE ARE FINDING THESE CELLS RIGHT IN THE DEEP INTERIOR OF THE METEORITE , SO IT MEANS THAT THEY ARE NOT CONTAMINANTS . Narrator : IF CHANDRA HAS FOUND MATCHING CELLS INSIDE THE METEORITE , IT PROVES THE RED RAIN DIDN 'T SIMPLY DEPOSIT THE CELLS ON THE ROCK AFTER IT HIT LAND . THEY MUST HAVE BEEN INSIDE THE METEORITE AS IT HURLED TOWARDS EARTH AND EXPLODED INTO TINY PIECES . Wickramasinghe : THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A HUGE NUMBER OF THESE RED-RAIN CELLS , AND THE TOTAL WEIGHT WOULD HAVE BEEN TONS . Narrator : IF SO , THE RED CELLS MAY HAVE SETTLED INTO THE CLOUD LAYER , WHERE THEY STAYED FOR WEEKS , GRADUALLY FALLING AS RED RAIN . IF HIS ANALYSIS IS CORRECT , IT WOULD NOT ONLY EXPLAIN THE RED RAIN . IT COULD PROVE THAT LIFE EXISTS BEYOND THE EARTH . Wickramasinghe : IF THE RED-RAIN CELLS CAME FROM SPACE , IT ESSENTIALLY BELONGS TO ANOTHER WORLD . BUT IF IT IS FROM OUTER SPACE , HOW SAFE IS IT ? COULD WE BE CONSUMED BY A CONTAGION THAT CAN 'T BE STOPPED ? THERE COULD BE A SERIOUS RISK OF A PANDEMIC THAT MIGHT EVEN WIPE OUT THE WHOLE OF MANKIND . Narrator : SINCE 2012 , PROFESSOR CHANDRA WICKRAMASINGHE HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING THE CAUSE OF BLOOD-COLORED RAINS THAT HAVE PLAGUED SRI LANKA . OH , MY GOD . THIS IS REALLY RED , ISN 'T IT ? THAT 'S AMAZING . HIS RESEARCH MAY PROVE THAT THE RAIN CONTAINS ALIEN ORGANISMS - - ORGANISMS HE BELIEVES FIRST ENTERED THE EARTH 'S ATMOSPHERE INSIDE A METEORITE . THE RED-RAIN CELLS CAME FROM SPACE , AND THE METEORITES ARE JUST CARRYING THEM TO OUR PLANET . Narrator : CHANDRA APPROACHES NASA WITH HIS BOLD DECLARATION OF ALIEN LIFE . BUT THE AGENCY REMAINS WARY . NASA TELLS US IT IS NOT FUNDING RESEARCH IN THIS AREA . REPRESENTATIVES DECLINE AN INTERVIEW . CONVERSELY , THE SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENT IS INTRIGUED AND EMBRACES THE THEORY . FOR SAMARANAYAKE , WHAT 'S MOST TROUBLING IS THAT THESE CELLS SEEM TO BE MULTIPLYING , AND HIS LATEST TESTS SUGGEST THEY COULD BE DANGEROUS TO HUMANS . URANIUM IS RADIOACTIVE AND TOXIC IF INGESTED OR INHALED . IT 'S CANCER-CAUSING , AND EXPOSURE TO HIGH DOSES CAN LEAD TO FATAL KIDNEY DAMAGE . THESE CELLS , IF THEY INTERACT WITH LIVING CELLS ON THE EARTH , MIGHT PRODUCE SOME HARMFUL EFFECTS . NEARLY 100 TONS OF SPACE ROCK HIT THE EARTH EVERY YEAR . COULD SOME OF IT BE CARRYING MICROSCOPIC CELLS SIMILAR TO THE ONES CHANDRA BELIEVES HE FOUND IN THE RED RAIN ? I THINK WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT LIFE-FORMS WOULD ARRIVE ON THE EARTH THAT WOULD CAUSE DISEASES AND WOULD AFFECT ECOLOGIES OF EXISTING PLANT AND ANIMAL LIFE , SO THERE COULD BE A SERIOUS RISK OF A PANDEMIC THAT MIGHT EVEN WIPE OUT THE WHOLE OF MANKIND . Narrator : DESPITE THE PROFESSOR 'S THEORY , NO ONE KNOWS EXACTLY WHERE THE STRANGE RED CELLS CAME FROM , WHAT THEY ARE , AND IF THEY POSE A THREAT . UNTIL THEN , ANOTHER MONSOON SEASON DRAWS NEAR , AND RESIDENTS OF SRI LANKA WATCH THE GATHERING CLOUDS AND PRAY FOR COLORLESS RAIN . ACROSS OUR PLANET , EXTRAORDINARY HAPPENINGS TEASE THE BOUNDARY OF WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE POSSIBLE . 9,000 MILES AWAY , MYSTERIOUS , TERRIFYING BOOMS ARE SHAKING RESIDENTS ALL ALONG THE EAST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES . CLAUDETTE AND MIKE HUSSEY HAVE JUST MOVED INTO THEIR NEW HOME IN A PEACEFUL SEASIDE TOWN NEAR CAPE FEAR . THEY 'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO LIFE IN THEIR QUIET NEW NEIGHBORHOOD . BUT THEN SOMETHING SHATTERS THEIR PEACE . I WAS SITTING AT MY DESK IN MY OFFICE , WORKING AWAY AT THE COMPUTER , AND I FELT THIS LARGE BOOM . [ BOOM ] IT WAS JUST SO LOUD THAT THE WINDOWS SHOOK . IT WAS VERY LOUD . I JUST GOT UP , AND I RAN OUTSIDE TO SEE WHAT HAD HIT THE HOUSE . I WAS LOOKING FOR DAMAGE . MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS SOMETHING FELL FROM THE SKY . I DON 'T KNOW IF IT WAS A METEOR OR A PART OF AN AIRPLANE OR SOMETHING . Narrator : THE HUSSEYS HAVE JUST LEARNED WHAT LOCALS ALREADY KNOW - - THIS ISN 'T AN ISOLATED EVENT . SEVERAL TIMES A YEAR , EARTH-SHATTERING BOOMS RATTLE CAPE FEAR RESIDENTS . I HEARD THIS BOOM . THAT 'S WHEN I TOOK OFF AND I HEADED FOR INSIDE THE HOUSE . COMES OUT OF THE BLUE , OBVIOUSLY . IT 'S JUST quot ; BOOM ! quot ; AND IT SCARES YOU TO DEATH . [ RATTLING ] AND ALL OF A SUDDEN , 10 , 20 FRIENDS ARE ALL LIKE , quot ; WHOA ! DID YOU GUYS - - ANYBODY ELSE FEEL THAT ? ANYBODY ELSE 'S HOUSE SHAKE ? quot ; YOU THINK AN EXPLOSION HAS TAKEN PLACE SOMEWHERE RIGHT NEARBY . WHEN YOUR HOUSE RATTLES OR WHEN YOUR HOUSE VIBRATES OR WHEN YOUR OFFICE SHAKES , OF COURSE YOU 'RE GONNA BE SCARED . Narrator : CAPE FEAR ISN 'T THE ONLY PLACE ROCKED BY THESE SOUNDS . THERE ARE OTHER REPORTS OF ALARMING EXPLOSIVE BOOMS THAT NO ONE CAN EXPLAIN . IN ITALY , THEY CALL THEM THE BRONTIDI , IN JAPAN , THE UMINARI , AND IN THE PHILIPPINES , RETUMBOS . THE TERRIFIED CAPE FEAR RESIDENTS CALL THE SHOCKING RUMBLE SENECA GUNS , AFTER LAKE SENECA IN UPSTATE NEW YORK , WHERE SIMILAR BOOMS ARE HEARD . AFTER YEARS OF ENDURING THESE SHATTERING BOOMS , RESIDENTS HAVE BEGUN TO ASK THEMSELVES , quot ; ARE THE NOISES COMING FROM ABOVE ? quot ; Byrd : SOMETIMES , I FEEL THE BOOMS , AND I 'LL SEE ORANGE , GLOWING BALLS OUT OVER THE SEA . SOME PEOPLE THINK THE ORANGE , GLOWING BALLS ARE UFOs . Narrator : THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST IS RACKED BY DEADENING , EXPLOSIVE SONIC BOOMS . PERPLEXED LOCALS CALL THEM THE SENECA GUNS . SOMETIMES , THEY SOUND LIKE FIREWORKS , BUT THE STRONGEST CAN MAKE THE EARTH RUMBLE . COULD THIS BE A HANGOVER FROM POWERFUL STORMS ? DENISE BRADLEY IS DETERMINED TO FIND OUT . Bradley : EVERY TIME I HEAR THE SENECA GUNS OR I FEEL THE SENECA GUNS , I MAKE SURE I JOT DOWN THE TIME . I JOT DOWN ALL OF THE WEATHER FOR THE DAY . quot ; THIS IS THE DAY IT HAPPENED ON . IT WAS SUNNY , NOT CLOUDY.quot ; OR , quot ; IT WAS CLOUDY , NOT RAINY.quot ; I KEEP A LOG OF EVERYTHING . WE HAVE HERE MARCH 2nd AND 3rd OF OUR LAST SENECA GUN EPISODES . FAIRLY VIOLENT . Narrator : ACCORDING TO DENISE 'S LOG , MARCH 2 AND 3 , 2013 , WERE SUNNY , CLOUDLESS DAYS WITH NO THUNDERSTORMS IN SIGHT . BUT THUNDER CAN BE HEARD A FULL 12 MILES FROM THE EYE OF A STORM , SO COULD GIANT , OFFSHORE THUNDERHEADS BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SENECA GUNS ? [ GULLS CRYING ] [ RADIO CHATTER ] METEOROLOGIST STEVE PFAFF 'S JOB IS MONITORING THE WEATHER ALONG THE EAST COAST . HE REVIEWS THE RADAR SCANS FOR MARCH 2 AND 3 , 2013 . Pfaff : WELL , GIVEN THAT THERE WAS NO THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY WITHIN ANY CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE WILMINGTON AREA , IT 'S HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT THUNDERSTORMS PLAYED A ROLE IN THE SOUNDS THOSE DAYS . Narrator : THERE IS A REMARKABLE ATMOSPHERIC EFFECT KNOWN AS A TEMPERATURE INVERSION . THIS OCCURS WHEN COOL AIR IS TRAPPED UNDER WARMER AIR IN THE LAYER NEXT TO THE EARTH 'S SURFACE . THE COOL AIR ACTS AS A TUNNEL , CHANNELING THE SOUND , MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO HEAR THINGS HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY . COULD DENISE 'S RECORDS OF SENECA GUNS ON MARCH 2nd AND 3rd BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE SAME ATMOSPHERIC ABERRATION ? [ THUNDER RUMBLES ] [ THUNDER CRASHES ] PFAFF CHECKS HIS RADAR FOR THUNDERSTORMS FURTHER AWAY FROM CAPE FEAR . Pfaff : THIS IS THE RADAR DATA FOR MARCH 3rd OF 2013 . AS THAT RADAR GOES OUT , WE SEE NO RADAR RETURNS OF A THUNDERSTORM WITHIN 200 NAUTICAL MILES OF OUR RADAR SYSTEM . Narrator : FROM THIS DATA , IT 'S CLEAR THAT TEMPERATURE INVERSIONS ARE NOT TO BLAME . ANOTHER THEORY SUGGESTS THAT THE SOUNDS ARE DUE TO SOMETHING MANMADE . COULD THE SOURCE BE MORE COVERT - - PERHAPS EXPLOSIONS FROM MILITARY EXERCISES AT SEA ? JAMIE MONCRIEF HAS LIVED IN THE AREA FOR MOST OF HIS LIFE . Moncrief : THE MOST POPULAR THEORY IS THAT IT 'S JUST SONIC BOOMS . NORTH CAROLINA HAS GOT A VERY RICH MILITARY HISTORY , AND ALL OF THOSE GUYS HAVE SUPERSONIC AIRCRAFT , OBVIOUSLY , AND DO A LOT OF TRAINING OFFSHORE . I GREW UP ON MILITARY INSTALLATIONS . A SUPERSONIC BOOM IS A VERY ABOVE-THE-HEAD EXPERIENCE . YOU FEEL IT FROM ABOVE . IT 'S A PERCUSSION . IT 'S A VERY DRAMATIC BOOM . A SENECA GUN IS MORE OF A RUMBLE AND A GRUMBLE AND A ROLL . IN MY OPINION , THEY SIMPLY JUST ARE NOT SONIC BOOMS . Narrator : THE LOCAL MILITARY BASES CATEGORICALLY DENY THAT THEIR JETS ARE RESPONSIBLE . Bradley : THIS IS HAPPENING . IT 'S HAPPENING FREQUENTLY ENOUGH WHERE SOMEBODY SHOULD HAVE AN ANSWER , AND ALL THE WHILE , THE MILITARY 'S SAYING , quot ; IT WAS NOT US . quot ; HOW MANY TIMES DO WE NEED TO TELL YOU ? WE DID NOT BREAK THE SOUND BARRIER.quot ; Narrator : IN FACT , THE SENECA GUNS WERE REPORTED LONG BEFORE AIRPLANES WERE INVENTED . JAMES FENIMORE COOPER DESCRIBED THEM IN A LAKE SENECA-SET NOVEL IN 1850 . THE EVIDENCE DOESN 'T SUPPORT DISTANT THUNDER , TEMPERATURE INVERSIONS , OR SONIC BOOMS . MANY IN CAPE FEAR ARE CONVINCED THE SOUNDS DON 'T COME FROM THE SKY AT ALL BUT FROM SOMEWHERE FAR BENEATH THEIR FEET . IT FEELS AS THOUGH IT COMES FROM BELOW AND RESONATES FROM THE GROUND AND COMES UP . EVEN WHEN YOU 'RE IN A BOAT , IT TRULY FELT LIKE IT HAD COME UP FROM UNDERNEATH US . Narrator : IF THE TRUE SOURCE IS ROOTED DEEP IN THE EARTH , WHAT 'S THE CAUSE , AND HOW SAFE ARE THE RESIDENTS LIVING ON TOP OF IT ? Narrator : RESIDENTS OF CAPE FEAR , NORTH CAROLINA , ARE RATTLED BY EARTH-SHATTERING AND UNEXPLAINED SONIC BOOMS . INVESTIGATIONS SHIFT FOCUS TO SUBTERRANEAN ACTIVITY . PROFESSOR JACK HALL IS A GEOLOGIST AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA . WELL , HERE WE HAVE THE EAST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES , AND HERE 'S THE LOCATION OF WILMINGTON . THESE RED LINES INDICATE LARGE FAULT ZONES ALONG THE EAST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES . FAULT ZONES ARE A SERIES OF CRACKS IN THE EARTH 'S CRUST . AND WHEN THEY DO MOVE , THEY WILL GENERATE AN EARTHQUAKE . THERE IS A POTENTIAL SOURCE HERE FOR THE GENERATION OF EARTHQUAKES AND THE GENERATION OF , POTENTIALLY , SOUND . Narrator : LOOKING AT THE SEISMIC DATA FOR THE AREA , PROFESSOR HALL COMES TO AN UNEXPECTED CONCLUSION . IF WE TURN THIS OVER , THE YELLOW DOTS ON HERE INDICATE THE LOCATION OF SEISMOGRAPHS . THEY WILL PICK UP EARTH MOVEMENTS THAT WE CAN 'T EVEN FEEL . THE RED DOTS ON HERE ARE THE LOCATION OF EPICENTERS WHERE EARTHQUAKES ACTUALLY OCCURRED FROM 1973 TO PRESENT , SO THIS IS THE PAST 40 YEARS . WHAT YOU 'LL NOTICE IS PARTICULARLY AROUND WILMINGTON , THERE 'S VIRTUALLY NOTHING IN THIS AREA . SO THESE BOOMS AND EARTHQUAKES THAT ACTUALLY OCCUR DON 'T MATCH UP . Narrator : WITH NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE SUBTERRANEAN THEORY , ATTENTION TURNS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF ANALYZING THE BOOM ITSELF TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY . THOUGH REPORTED FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS , THERE IS NO KNOWN RECORDING OF THE EXPLOSIVE SOUNDS . IN APRIL 2012 , PAUL GLASER SETS OUT TO CHANGE THAT . HE BECOMES FIXATED ON RECORDING THE NOISE THAT 'S BEEN SHAKING HIS PARENTS' HOUSE AND NERVES FOR YEARS . I WAS SO INTERESTED IN IT , I BASICALLY JUST SET MY PHONE UP , POINTED IT WITH THE SPEAKER OUT , AND I WOULD JUST HIT RECORD . AND THEN I 'D SIT INSIDE , KIND OF LIKE A FISHERMAN . AND IT TOOK ME A COUPLE WEEKS , BUT I HEARD THEM . I 'VE GOT IT RIGHT INSIDE . I 'LL SHOW YOU . [ BOOM ] HEAR THAT ? [ BOOM ] THAT WAS ON THE QUIETER SIDE . IT DIDN 'T SHAKE THE HOUSE OR RATTLE THE WINDOWS , BUT IT DEFINITELY - - I MEAN , IT WAS LOUD ENOUGH THAT I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING ON WHEN IT HAPPENED . Narrator : PAUL HAS SINCE PLAYED THIS SOUND FOR OTHER CAPE FEAR RESIDENTS . [ BOOM ] EVERY PERSON THAT HAD HEARD THEM THAT I PLAYED IT FOR WAS LIKE , quot ; YEAH . THAT 'S THEM . THAT 'S EXACTLY THEM.quot ; Narrator : UNFORTUNATELY , THE SOUND IS SO GENERAL THAT IT OFFERS UP FEW NEW CLUES TO ITS ORIGIN . WITH NO OBVIOUS SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION , COULD THERE BE ONE THAT DEFIES RATIONAL UNDERSTANDING ? LIKE MANY CAPE FEAR RESIDENTS , IVY BYRD IS UNSETTLED BY THE TERRIFYING BOOMS . Byrd : IF THERE 'S SOMETHING UNEXPLAINED THAT CAN SHAKE YOUR ENTIRE HOUSE , LET ALONE A CITY , THAT 'S REALLY SCARY . Narrator : BUT OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS , IVY AND HER NEIGHBORS HAVE WITNESSED SOMETHING STRANGE THAT OCCURS AT THE SAME TIME AS THE BOOMS . SOMETIMES , AT NIGHT , IF I FEEL THE BOOMS , I 'LL LOOK OUTSIDE , AND I 'LL OCCASIONALLY SEE ORANGE , GLOWING BALLS OUT OVER THE SEA . AND I DON 'T KNOW WHAT IT IS . THEY JUST STAY THERE . THEY 'RE IN A LITTLE PACK , BUT IT 'S NOT A PLANE OR ANYTHING , BECAUSE IT DOESN 'T BLINK . IT 'S JUST AN ORANGE , GLOWING BALL . ONE NIGHT , THERE WERE SO MANY OUT THERE , MY NEIGHBORS AND MY FAMILY , WE ALL GATHERED OUT THERE AND JUST WATCHED THEM . Narrator : IVY SAYS SHE ONLY SEES THESE LIGHTS WHEN THE SENECA GUNS OCCUR . Byrd : IT DOES FEEL LIKE THE BOOMS ARE COMING FROM THE SAME DIRECTION AS THE ORANGE BALLS . Narrator : IF THEY ARE RELATED , WHAT COULD THEY BE ? SOME PEOPLE THINK THE ORANGE , GLOWING BALLS ARE UFOs OR ALIENS . IF IT 'S SOMETHING UNEXPLAINED , I GUESS YOU JUST MAKE UP YOUR OWN OPINION . Moncrief : I THINK THE FEAR OF IT IS THAT IT 'S SIMPLY NOT KNOWN . WHY CAN 'T IT BE UFOs ? WHY CAN 'T IT BE ALIENS ? Narrator : AS THE THEORIES BECOME MORE OUTLANDISH , THE SENECA GUNS CONTINUE TO SHOCK THE RESIDENTS OF CAPE FEAR . IT WAS VIOLENT , AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE SHOOK UP HERE . Narrator : AND THE DEEPER SCIENCE DIGS INTO THE CAUSE , THE MORE PERPLEXING THE PHENOMENON BECOMES . Mike : WE WERE AFRAID . WE DIDN 'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS . SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT THEORIES ABOUT WHAT IT IS , BUT NO ONE CAN EXPLAIN WHAT THEY ARE . [ BOOM ] Narrator : PERHAPS ONE DAY , SCIENCE WILL CATCH UP WITH THE SENECA GUNS AND THE MYSTERY OF THEIR CAUSE WILL BE REVEALED . [ RATTLING ] UNTIL THEN , RESIDENTS CONTINUE TO DOCUMENT THE STRANGE BOOMS ON THEIR OWN AND HOPE THAT ALL THEIR OBSESSIVE WORK PAYS OFF WITH AN ANSWER AND A LITTLE PEACE AND QUIET . ACROSS THE ATLANTIC IN THE UNITED KINGDOM IS A BOOK THAT HAS BAFFLED GENERATIONS OF SCHOLARS AND LAYMEN . NOW MODERN SCIENCE IS FINALLY PUTTING IT UNDER THE MICROSCOPE . CAN IT CRACK A 400-YEAR-OLD CODE ? AND IF SO , WHAT WILL IT REVEAL ABOUT OTHER CIVILIZATIONS ? GERRY KENNEDY , A DESCENDENT OF THE MAN WHO FOUND THIS EXTRAORDINARY BOOK , IS DETERMINED TO DECIPHER THE MANUSCRIPT . IT 'S IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO GET HOOKED , BECAUSE IT 'S JUST SO BIZARRE . IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THERE 'S SOMETHING PROFOUND ABOUT IT , BUT NOTHING IN IT HAS EVER MADE ANY SENSE . IT IS THE MOST MYSTERIOUS MANUSCRIPT IN THE WORLD . THE BOOK IS FIRST DISCOVERED IN 1912 BY GERRY 'S ANCESTOR WILFRID VOYNICH , A DEALER IN ANTIQUE BOOKS . HE FOUND THE MANUSCRIPT THAT CAME TO BEAR HIS NAME IN A JESUIT LIBRARY ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF ROME . THE MANUSCRIPT IS REALLY EXTRAORDINARY AND BIZARRE . IF YOU JUST LEAF THROUGH THIS FACSIMILE WE HAVE HERE - - IT 'S WRITTEN ON VELLUM , WHICH IS ANIMAL SKIN , AND IT 'S ROUGHLY COLORED AND RATHER AMATEURISH . Narrator : VOYNICH FINDS A TATTERED LETTER TUCKED INSIDE THE MANUSCRIPT . THE LETTER REVEALS THAT THE JESUITS HAD OWNED THE MANUSCRIPT FOR 250 YEARS AND HAD BEEN TRYING TO DECIPHER THE STRANGE TEXT AND IDENTIFY THE BIZARRE ILLUSTRATIONS . Kennedy : THE MANUSCRIPT WAS SENT TO A SCIENTIST AND LINGUIST , ATHANASIUS KIRCHER , HOPING THAT HE WOULD THROW SOME LIGHT ON WHAT THE MANUSCRIPT WAS ABOUT . Narrator : KIRCHER WAS A LEADING JESUIT SCHOLAR , ONE OF THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME , AND THE JESUITS , WHO COUNT THE CURRENT POPE AMONG THEIR NUMBER , ARE RENOWNED AS THE INTELLECTUALS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH , DETERMINED IN THEIR PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE . IT 'S A MYSTERIOUS BOOK . IT 'S THE TYPE OF THING THAT WOULD HAVE ENTHRALLED KIRCHER . HE WAS FASCINATED BY EVERYTHING . HE WROTE ON EVERYTHING . HE INVESTIGATED EVERYTHING . HERE IS A MYSTERY OF THE UNIVERSE WHICH HAS TO BE OPENED BECAUSE IT WILL REVEAL SOMETHING MORE ABOUT GOD . Narrator : BUT IT APPEARS GOD NEVER SPOKE TO KIRCHER THROUGH THE MYSTERIOUS MANUSCRIPT . HE WAS UNABLE TO MAKE SENSE OF IT . WITH ITS CONTENTS A MYSTERY , PERHAPS EVEN HERESY , THE JESUITS KEPT THE MANUSCRIPT LOCKED AWAY UNTIL WILFRID VOYNICH REDISCOVERED IT IN 1912 . BUT WHAT WAS THERE TO FEAR ? COULD IT HOLD A CLUE TO WORLDS BEYOND OUR OWN ? THE WORD quot ; ALIENSquot ; COMES TO MIND . Narrator : IN 1912 , WILFRID VOYNICH DISCOVERS AN ANCIENT MANUSCRIPT WRITTEN IN AN INDECIPHERABLE CODE . HE ALSO DISCOVERS A LETTER INSIDE THE BOOK . WRITTEN IN 1666 , IT REVEALS ONE OF THE PREVIOUS OWNERS HAD A THEORY ABOUT ITS AUTHOR , A POTENTIALLY VITAL CLUE TO THE BOOK 'S MEANING . Kennedy : THE SAID BOOK BELONGED TO THE EMPEROR RUDOLPH . HE BELIEVED THE AUTHOR WAS ROGER BACON , THE ENGLISHMAN . ROGER BACON WAS A 13th CENTURY MONK WITH A FASCINATION FOR ALCHEMY - - A MIX OF MAGIC AND SCIENCE ATTEMPTING TO TURN ORDINARY METALS INTO GOLD . THE CHURCH CONSIDERED IT HERESY . Kennedy : ROGER BACON WAS ALWAYS TREADING IN THAT AREA . THERE 'S A POSSIBILITY THAT THE WHOLE VOYNICH MANUSCRIPT IS SECRETS OF ALCHEMY . SO , THE ASSUMPTION WAS , FOR VOYNICH , THAT BACON MIGHT WELL HAVE HAD TO MASK ANY OF HIS RESEARCHES AND THEREFORE PUT IT INTO CIPHER . Narrator : BUT CRYPTOGRAPHER GORDON RUGG , WHO HAS A DETAILED KNOWLEDGE OF MEDIEVAL CIPHER TECHNIQUES , IS NOT CONVINCED . Rugg : LEADING MODERN CODE BREAKERS HAVE RUN THE TEXT OF THE VOYNICH MANUSCRIPT THROUGH SOFTWARE AND THEN THEY 'VE LOOKED FOR PATTERNS EVERY 10 , 20 , 40 CHARACTERS . AND THEY 'VE FOUND NOTHING . Narrator : IF THE BOOK IS WRITTEN IN CODE , IT IS A MORE ADVANCED ONE THAN ANYTHING MODERN COMPUTERS OR EXPERT CODE BREAKERS CAN UNLOCK . BUT WHAT IF THERE 'S ANOTHER EXPLANATION - - THAT THE TEXT IS NOT A CODE AT ALL BUT SIMPLY HAS NO MEANING ? GORDON RUGG BELIEVES THERE IS A POWERFUL MOTIVE TO DO JUST THAT . Rugg : IN THE MIDDLE AGES , BOOKS OF WONDERS WERE WORTH A LOT . I THINK IT 'S ALMOST CERTAINLY A HOAX . HOAXING THE VOYNICH MANUSCRIPT FOR MONEY WOULD MAKE EXCELLENT SENSE . Narrator : EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THIS THEORY . IN THE LETTER VOYNICH FINDS WITH THE MANUSCRIPT IS A REFERENCE TO ONE VERY WEALTHY OWNER OF THE BOOK . Kennedy : THE SAID BOOK BELONGED TO THE EMPEROR RUDOLPH , AND THAT HE PRESENTED TO THE BEARER WHO BOUGHT THE BOOK 600 DUCATS . Narrator : RUDOLPH II WAS THE HOLY ROMAN EMPEROR IN THE LATE 16th CENTURY . HE WAS OBSESSED WITH THE OCCULT AND A TEMPTING TARGET FOR HOAXERS . FOR HIM , 600 DUCATS - - $ 80,000 TODAY - - WOULD BE A SMALL PRICE TO PAY FOR THE MANUSCRIPT IF HE BELIEVED IT CONTAINED THE ENCRYPTED SECRETS OF ALCHEMY . PRIME SUSPECTS IN THIS HOAX THEORY ARE JOHN DEE AND EDWARD KELLY , TWO ENGLISHMEN INVOLVED IN THE SCHEME TO TURN COPPER INTO GOLD . KELLY LIVED IN PRAGUE , THE CAPITAL OF THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE IN THE 1590s , WHEN RUDOLPH REIGNED . COULD HE AND DEE HAVE FABRICATED THE MANUSCRIPT TO SELL TO THE EMPEROR ? TO FIND OUT , SCIENTISTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA CARBON-DATED SAMPLES OF THE ANIMAL SKIN , OR VELLUM , THE MANUSCRIPT IS WRITTEN ON . BY MEASURING THE DECAY OF RADIOACTIVE CARBON-14 , IT CAN DETERMINE THE AGE OF ORGANIC MATTER , LIKE THE VELLUM OF THE MANUSCRIPT . WILL THE CONFIRMED DATE OF THE MANUSCRIPT ADD WEIGHT TO THE THEORY THAT IT IS A 1590s HOAX ? WELL , WE DATED FOUR VELLUM PAGES DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE BOOK AND FOUND THAT ALL FOUR OF THOSE PAGES HAD VERY TIGHTLY CLUSTERED RADIOCARBON DATES . AND THE RADIOCARBON AGE IS 1404 A.D. TO 1438 A.D. AT 95 % CONFIDENCE . Narrator : THIS CARBON-DATING EVIDENCE BLOWS AWAY THE IDEA THAT DEE AND KELLY HOAXED THE MANUSCRIPT . IT WAS WRITTEN OVER 100 YEARS BEFORE THEY WERE BORN . IF THE BOOK IS A HOAX , IT DID NOT ARISE OUT OF RUDOLPH II 's OBSESSION WITH THE OCCULT . SO THE VOYNICH MANUSCRIPT REMAINS A 600-YEAR-OLD MYSTERY . IN HIS MISSION TO DECIPHER IT , GERRY KENNEDY TRIES ONE FINAL APPROACH . CAN THE OBSCURE ILLUSTRATIONS TELL US ABOUT THE AUTHOR ? Kennedy : THE BIGGEST SECTION IS RARE-LOOKING PLANTS , BUT THEY ARE INCREDIBLY BIZARRE , VERY STRANGE-LOOKING THINGS . Narrator : GERRY TAKES A COPY OF THE MANUSCRIPT TO KEW GARDENS IN LONDON . AN INTERNATIONALLY RENOWNED CENTER OF BOTANICAL RESEARCH , IT HAS OVER 30,000 LIVING PLANTS - - THE WORLD 'S LARGEST COLLECTION . IF KEW 'S SCIENTISTS CAN IDENTIFY THE PLANTS IN THE MANUSCRIPT , IT MIGHT REVEAL CLUES TO ITS MEANING AND ORIGIN . Simpson : THIS ALMOST LOOKS LIKE IT 'S GRAFTED ONTO THE BASE OF THE PLANT , BUT YOU WOULDN 'T , IN NATURE , SEE ANYTHING HAPPENING LIKE THAT . SO I THINK YOU CAN SAFELY SAY THAT THESE ARE PLANTS OF INVENTION RATHER THAN REAL PLANTS . LIKE NOTHING ON EARTH ? LIKE NOTHING ON EARTH . THERE 'S ALSO A SECTION WHICH ONE WOULD WANT TO CALL SORT OF COSMOLOGICAL OR ASTROLOGICAL . THERE 'S A SPIRAL THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID CLEARLY MUST BE ANDROMEDA . Narrator : ANDROMEDA IS A SPIRAL GALAXY . IT 'S THE CLOSEST ONE TO EARTH 'S AND BEARS A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE TO THE VOYNICH DIAGRAM . YET IT IS MILLIONS OF LIGHT-YEARS AWAY . ITS SPIRAL SHAPE IS ONLY VISIBLE WITH MODERN , HIGH-POWERED TELESCOPES . IF IT DOES REPRESENT THE GALAXY , A FAR MORE PUZZLING QUESTION IS RAISED . HOW COULD ANYONE ON EARTH DRAW SOMETHING WE HAD YET TO DISCOVER ? IT APPEARS AS IF THERE MUST BE SOME UNDERLYING SENSE TO IT . AND THE MOST AMAZING THEORY IS THAT IT 'S A CODE BEEN SENT DOWN FROM WAY OUT . THE WORD quot ; ALIENSquot ; COMES TO MIND . Narrator : FOR KENNEDY AND OTHERS , THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT THE MANUSCRIPT IS AN INTRODUCTION TO A WORLD NONE OF US CAN YET IMAGINE - - ONE SO REMOTE AND UNEARTHLY THAT EVEN ITS SYMBOLS , WORDS , AND SIMPLE PLANT LIFE BAFFLE OUR BRAINS . THE TRUTH OR WILD IMAGININGS ? WE 'LL NEVER KNOW . BUT EVEN THE MOST REMOTE POSSIBILITY THAT ANOTHER SPECIES IS TRYING TO TELL US ABOUT THEIR WORLD IS TOO TEMPTING A RIDDLE TO GO UNRESOLVED , AND SO THE MAGNETISM OF THE MYSTERIOUS MANUSCRIPT ENDURES .

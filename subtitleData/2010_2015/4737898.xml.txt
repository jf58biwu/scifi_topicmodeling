 They were found in the basement of a torn down hospital Among the human subjects were Manchurians ... White Russians ... even Japanese . The Sylvian fissure of the right temporal lobe . Electrical stimulus is applied to cerebral tissue . I 'm outside me ! I 'm looking down at me ! He 's hallucinating an astral projection . Still no more than a hallucination . What 's this ? They thought the same thing we did . They saw something . Something we can 't see . No hallucination . This is no hallucination . Mommy ! No ! Go back to bed ! Miyuki ! Kaori ! This room ? The day Father died . I have to call my sister . What am I doing now ? Taking my blood pressure . So I look like a nurse . A lot of people do . Most people think they 're in a hospital . I 'm not ? You died . That 's how it is . It confuses those left behind ... because it doesn 't feel real to them , either . Don 't worry . Soon you 'll be able to see how it really is . Follow me . What ? Your slippers . Have we already been found ? You 're still in the car . When they find you , you won 't look so pretty . How 's the other female ? She 's speechless with shock . Is she a virgin ? Yes . You 've got to make her eat . Yes . KYOFU Are you Miyuki ? Yes , I am . Hello , I 'm Kazushi . I 'm Takumi . I 'm Rieko . We worried . There were only 3 of us at the station . Hattori had said he would cancel if even one of us didn 't show . I 'm sorry , I took the earlier train . I 'm Kazushi . I 'm Hattori . What are you looking at ? I 'm remembering my childhood . I 'm locking up . We 're about to conduct our own executions . What ? That 's what we 're doing , right ? Anything to say ? Where do people who kill themselves wind up ? I hear it 's someplace very scary . We don 't go anywhere , we just disappear . I 'll light it . Want to get off ? Wake her up . I want to talk to her . Miyuki , do you know who I am ? Mother ? I never thought we 'd have to meet like this . You , I can tell . This isn 't the afterlife . Surely you learned ... about the Sylvian fissure in medical school . If you apply electrical stimulation , you hallucinate . Don 't you find it mysterious that function is programmed into the brain ? The rational process of evolution doesn 't explain it . It holds the key to a new evolutionary path ... For the evolution of human spirituality . Raise it . Can you see what you look like ? Can you see yourself ? That 's just your brain hallucinating . We 're going beyond that . What 's that ? What are you doing ! You 're going to see what humans can 't . The reality of the world beyond our world . Stop ! Stop ! You wanted to be reborn , didn 't you ? You can 't see anything yet . It will take a little longer ... for your brain to process the color particles . Miyuki and Rieko aren 't in their quarantine rooms ! Look ! This was 1 hour ago . WANTED : OTA MIYUKI Are you Ota Kaori ? Yes . I 'm Motojima . Thank you for conveying our messages . This way . Detective Hirasawa . I just had an odd report from someone ... living across the street from Miyuki 's apartment . He says he saw someone in the apartment last night . - My sister ? - Not necessarily . You didn 't go there last night , did you ? No , I didn 't . The computer . I had them look into it . The records from the past 6 months have been erased . It 's erased back to June 23rd ... the morning Miyuki went missing . Erased ? If she erased it herself ... she may have accessed a site she wanted to keep secret . Or someone instructed her . What time was it ? About 1AM , I think . In that window ? Yes . Can you have another look ? I 'm not ... I think there was someone else in the room . Someone else ? Why didn 't you say that before ? I 'm sorry . Are you sure it was that window , and not some other room ? Can you please go stand in that room ? That room . Was the other person you saw anyone of these ? Tell me . That room was pitch black ... but I could see the girl in a hazy light . Does that happen ? - Do you smell something ? - Yes . Maybe because it was sealed off . You 're staying here awhile ? My sister may try to contact me . Well , there 's a chance someone 's been coming here . Hopefully your sister . You should change the lock . Keep the chain locked tonight . What is it ? - I 've dreamed about this room - What ? Since the day my sister went missing . Every time it 's clearer ... like it 's the same dream . Do you think your sister killed herself ? Why do you ask that ? Her computer records were erased . There are sites like that , right ? This smell ... Yes . I think it 's blood . If Miyuki 's been visiting that room ... will it affect that girl , too ? The doctor said , during a previous experiment ... a patient in the same room had awful dreams ... with a terrible smell . It gave me chills just walking past their rooms . What did you dream about ? Sister ? Where were you ? Stop looking for me . Someone 's coming . This person 's very dangerous . Who was that ? My sister . What are you saying ? I 'm your sister . We 're not . Kaori ... Kaori ... I got a call from this clinic . Miyuki 's been checked in there . But she managed to escape . She 's a well-known neurosurgeon . She 's my mother . I thought Miyuki was your only family . We haven 't seen our mother in years ... since our father died . My sister 's in mother 's clinic ? Yes . It 's been a while . Are you surprised Miyuki 's my patient ? She 's just here for tests . She gets headaches . When I treated her ... she said something a little disturbing . That she had decided as a child that she wanted to die . That she didn 't feel human the way other people did . Miyuki never talked like that to us ... That the reason she 's stayed alive is because she thinks that maybe someday ... she 'll feel like other people . My sister told you that ? Has Miyuki been in touch with you ? Did you stay here last night ? Yes . Miyuki 's been visiting here . You 've been dreaming . What did my sister see ? What happened ? Wasn 't someone else here ? My sister ... It wasn 't Miyuki who told me that story I told you . It was another girl . Another girl Only girls who want to die would tell each other that . You 've been dreaming , too ? Yes . I go deep into a forest ... where I 'm growing something . I 'm not sure what . Something 's ... growing in the forest . Was Motojima dating Miyuki ? He reminded me of your father . Don 't talk about Father . Something 's strange . Doctor ! She gave herself a lethal dose of morphine . The doctor will abandon you , too . There 's no one else . Neither of the men made it . Mother ... What did you do to my sister ? This is where ... Miyuki had been staying . Reality exists beyond the world that ... human senses can perceive . That 's what your father and I always believed . We wanted to liberate ourselves from these two eyes that confine us ... and see the real world . In that moment , humans would become a new species . The spiritual evolution of human beings . Is that what my sister wanted to happen ? Miyuki wanted to be reborn . Why ? If I could have tested it on myself I certainly would have . I needed more than 2 subjects . Only I can judge ... whether what their brains are seeing is a hallucination or objective . But the results far exceeded my expectations . See ? Lt 's just like skin . Everything around her is slowly being affected . I assume our brains ... are starting to be affected , too . But it 's strange . You were away for so long ... but so powerfully connected . Sleep there ! You 're capable of tracking down her dreams . Bring a chair . Don 't worry , I won 't leave you alone . You haven 't slept ? How far will you follow her ? We owe her our lives . Don 't we ? The police are involved now . The doctor is fearless . Kaori . Kaori ! Sister ... Sister ! Lt 's them ! I know it 's them ! Forgive me ! Forgive me ! Lt 's a dream ! Lt 's gotten the rest of them ! Sister , that 's ... Don 't ! Don 't go there ! I 'm not dreaming . It wasn 't a dream , was it ? Hurry , come ! Dress her wounds ! Stop it ! You might never have been able to come back . Contact me when you remember what you saw . Yes . I have to call my sister ! What did we see ? That white light ... Sister ... It 's not true , that was a dream . Kaori ? Kaori ? Don 't I smell terrible ? Lt 's the smell of blood , my sister 's blood . Please , wipe away the smell of my sister 's blood . What happened ? I met your mother yesterday . And I learned something that 's beyond me . I think she was always controlling Miyuki . She used to be so gentle ... but turned into someone completely different . When we were little ... she told us stories about vampire movies . The vampire is always destroyed , in the end ... When it 's stabbed in the heart , or it 's exposed to light . She loved the sound of the vampire 's final scream as it died . She said they screamed like that ... because they know there is no afterlife . Humans can 't scream like that ... because we insist there is an afterlife . That 's why she liked vampires . Take the day off today . And do what ? Find my sister . The house we lived in when Dad was alive ... I don 't know if it 's still there . I heard a strange story , too . At your father 's hospital ... they operated on a patient with a terminal brain tumor . It turned into a big deal because it was totally unnecessary . Dad took responsibility and resigned . After that , he stayed at home and played with us . He planted lots of flowers in the garden . One day ... he hung himself . Hirasawa . Stop . We used to catch the school bus here . Kaori ! Sister ? I finally found it . It hasn 't changed at all . They never found someone to buy it . Is someone with you ? Rieko ? Rieko isn 't feeling well so she 's been resting in the back room . What 's wrong ? You look like you 've seen a ghost . I thought I 'd never see you again . That 's not true . You want to sleep with me ... but you sleep with my sister instead . I 'm not your sister anymore , right ? That night , we had a terrifying dream . We had the same dream . Come . Kaori ! Kaori ! Kaori ! Hurry , Kaori ! Mother ? After that ... We started seeing that white light . Deep in that forest , too . Sister ... What is it that you see ? You 'll see it soon , too . Is someone there ? Rieko ? Hello ? We 're already at the house . Mother 's team is here . You were in on it with them , all along . All right , I 'll explain . Just bring them here . The police are coming . What 's this you have ? No , no . That idiot ! You 're ! The other one is in the back . The other one ? You 're Rieko ? This is ! She 's pregnant . Rieko was a virgin . She still is . That 's why she 's always hungry . We 've come this far . We have to burn this place down . Doctor , I 'm done for , right ? I 'm sorry , I 'm truly sorry . Come . This thing . You really fell for it . Me , before I was reborn . Did you try to die ... the day Dad died ? I showed her the suicide website . Kaori . It 's not a fetus . This light ... You go back to your room . We were showed this , too . Impossible , right ? The doctor pulled off what 's impossible ... unless there 's a war . Amazing . Who cares what she gives birth to ? We 've pulled off a miracle . Her own child is taking her virginity . Your father and I saw it together . After we saw it ... we both realized there was no turning back . That no one would forgive what we were about to do . In the end , we tested it on your father . But he ... couldn 't live with what he could see . Kaori ? Look . You can see us . We weren 't watching a film . They 've been watching us ... ever since we saw that white light . They 've been watching us the whole time . Rieko still believes she 's in the afterlife . She 's living in eternal damnation in the afterlife . Rieko will give birth to ... The afterlife . We 'll all be eaten . Will we ... all die ? Doctor ! Hattori ! Doctor ! My head ! Lt 's splitting ! Lt 's talking ! Lt 's talking inside my head ! Sister ? Lt 's born ! What are you staring at ? They 're just going to eat us ! Turn it off ! They 'll see us . I want to see , what you and your father saw . Please , I don 't need anesthesia . All right . Kaori , hold my head ! Stay still now . What 's ! What you wanted to see . Sister ? So there is no afterlife ? Was Mother right ? Lt 's just invisible . All there is is this crazy world ? That 's right , see . I realized it when I hit you . How do you think you look , now ? You were dead even when you were alive . Just like Mother . Both you and Mother ... had been eaten by them a long time ago ! What is this ? Where do people who kill themselves wind up ? We don 't go anywhere ... we just disappear . Just disappear . Just disappear .

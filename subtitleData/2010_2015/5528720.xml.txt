 Please verify that the P1 ATA removal ... on replacement cap part 1 and 2 are complete . DMA M1 , M2 , M3 and M4 are complete . Okay . Copy that , Explorer . Dr. Stone , Houston . Medical is concerned about your ECG readings . I 'm fine , Houston . Well , Medical doesn 't agree , doc . Are you feeling nauseous ? " STONE " . Not any more than usual , Houston . Diagnostics are green . Link to communications card ready for data reception . If this works , when we touch down tomorrow , I 'm buying all you guys a round of drinks . CONTROL ' . That 's a date , doctor . Just remember , Houston 's partial to margaritas . STONE ' . Booting comms card now . Please confirm link . CONTROL ' . That 's a negative , we 're not seeing any data . " STONE " . Stand by , Houston , I 'm gonna reboot the comms card . CONTROL ' . Standing by . Houston , I have a bad feeling about this mission . Please expand . Okay , let me tell you a story . It was ' 96 . I 'd been up here for 42 days . Every time I passed over Texas , I looked down ... knowing that Mrs. Kowalski was looking up , thinking of me . Six weeks I 'm blowing kisses at that woman . Then we land at Edwards and I find out that shes run off with this lawyer . So I packed my car , and I headed to - CONTROL ' . Tijuana . You 've told this story , Kowalski . As Houston recalls , she , took off in your ' 74 GTO . Engineering requests fuel status on the jetpack prototype . Five hours off the reservation and I show 30 percent drain . Give my compliments to Engineering . Except for a slight malfunction in the nulling of the roll axis ... this jetpack is one prime piece of thrust . CONTROL ' . Engineering says thank you . Tell them I still prefer my ' 51 Corvette , though . Speaking of which , did I ever tell you ... We know the Corvette story . Even Engineering ? CONTROL ' . Especially Engineering . We 're going to miss you , Matt . STONE ' . Comms card reboot in progress . Thank you , doctor . Sheriff , whats your status ? Nearly there . Replacing battery module A1 and C. CONTROL ' . Could you be a little more specific ? Indeterminate estimates make Houston anxious . SHARWF ' . No , no , no , Houston . Don 't be anxious . Anxiety 's not good for the heart . System is ready to reactivate . Hubble telescope engaged . Upgrade fully functional . That applause you hear is for you , Sheriff . Congratulations . Kick back , take the rest of the day off . CONTROL ' . Matt , do you have a visual ... on just what Mission Specialist Sharifi is doing up there ? He appears to be doing some farm of the Macarena . But that would be just a best-guess scenario an my part . Dr. Stone , Houston . Medical now have you with a temperature drop to $ 5.9 ... and a heart-rate rise to 70 . How are you feeling ? ST ONE ' . Houston , Pm fine . It 's just keeping your lunch down in zero-G is harder than it looks . Dr. Stone , Medical is asking if you want to return to Explorer . Negative . We 've been here a week , Houston . Let 's just finish this . Ahem . Card is up . No , that 's a negative . I 'm afraid we 're getting nothing on this end , doctor . TN ' again . CONTROL ' . No , still nothing . Houston , can you please turn that music off ? Kowalski . Not a problem . Thank you , Kowalski . New , Houston ? That 's a negative . Could Houston be misinterpreting the data ? CONTROL ' . Well , we 're not receiving any data . Engineering is recommending a vie-check for component damage . Let me see what 's going an . What have we gut ? Visual examination doesn 't reveal any damaged components . The problem must be originating from the camms panel . CONTROL ' . Yeah , that seems to be the case . Engineering admits that you warned us that this could happen . That 's as close to an apology as you 're going to get from them . We should have listened to you , doc . Well , looks like we 're going to have to improvise . I 'm an it . CONTROL ' . How long do you think it 'll take you ? One hour . Ahem . Outstanding . Installing your system in the Hubble is the purpose of this mission ... and so we appreciate your patience , doctor . Kowalski , we know you don 't care about things like this ... but , for your information , this delay is not going to be long enough ... for you to break Anatoly Solovyev 's spacewalking record . It seems like you 're gonna be left - Seventy-five minutes shy ? Never crossed my mind . Matt ... it 's been a privilege . Right back at you , Houston . Enjoy your last walk . Am I a go to assist Dr. Stone in removing the panel ? - Assistance appreciated . - Permission granted . Thank you , Houston . Agh . Mind if I join the fun ? Certainly . Haw you feeling ? Like a Chihuahua that 's being tumble-dried . Well , it 's been a rough week . If it makes you feel any better ... I coughed up everything but my kidneys an my first ride . Shit . Unh . - H a , ha . - Sorry . I 'm used to a basement lab in a hospital where things fall to the floor . Thank you . Well , you 're the genius up here . I only drive the bus . Yeah , well , call me a genius ... if I can get this board initialized in the next hour . Explorer , this is Houston . Go ahead , Houston . NORAD reports a Russian satellite has incurred a missile strike . The impact has created a cloud of debris ... morbiting at 20,000 miles per hour . Current debris orbit does not overlap with your trajectory . We 'll keep you posted on any developments . WOMAN ' . Copy that , Houston . Should we be worried ? Na , let 's let the bays dawn there worry for us . Explorer , engage arm and pivot to cargo bay . WOMAN ' . Stand by for arm maneuver . Aah . So , doc , now that you work for NASA , how do you like us ? SHARWF ' . Kind of like winning the lottery , huh ? I was just happy that they didn 't cut the funding to my research . - Haw long was your training ? - Six months . " SHARWF " . Including holidays ? STONE ' . - Huh . Se , what is this scanning system ? SHARWF ' . Nothing , Matt . It 's just a new set of eyes to scan the edge of the universe . It 's designed for hospital use , but this one 's a prototype . WOMAN ' . Stand by for locking . - Unh . - Listen , they don 't bankroll prototypes . Even for your pretty blue eyes . Well , my eyes are brawn . Right now , your eyes are bloodshot . SHARWF ' . Kowalski ! Is this great or what ? And to think he went to Harvard . You gotta admit one thing : Can 't beat the view . Se , what do you like about being up here ? The silence . I could get used to it . Terrific . Houston , from first inspection , camms panel appears to be dead . Am I a go to cut link to auxiliary ? You 're the expert , doctor . It 's your call . Houston , I have a bad feeling about this mission . Please elaborate . It 's the same feeling I had about Mardi Gras in 1981 . That is affirmative . Surprisingly , Control hasn 't heard the Mardi Gras story . Please proceed . Well , it 's day one , and I 'm bumping my way down Bourbon Street ... laaking for a sister of a friend of mine . Streets are full of people , I 'm thinking there 's no way I 'm gonna find this girl . Proceeding to override . Then all of a sudden , I lack up and there she is . I 'm about to yell out . I see she 's holding hands with some hairy guy in board shorts ... and a Margaritaville shirt . And then I realize that this guy is not a guy . That my girl is holding hands with ...

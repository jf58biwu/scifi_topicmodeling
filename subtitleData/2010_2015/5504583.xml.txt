I was taking his wife 's pulse when I heard the news . She 's pretty . Very pretty . You took the pulse of Lady Zhuangji ? No way . It 's true . You saw she 's pregnant ? They couldn 't work out when she 's due . So they called me in . She shouldn 't be riding in a carriage lt could hurt the baby . I said I 'd treat you when I reoovered . Let 's go for a drink . My wife 's due as well . I should stay with her . After the birth , drinks are on me . Thank you . Grand Councilor Zhao Dun ! General Zhao Shuo ! Lady Zhuangji ! What 's my sister doing here ? A woman of the royal family is about to give birth to a Zhao . once he 's born ... I 'll be his uncle Zhao Dun is Grand Councilor His son is of to war , and will return a hero . How enviable ! Even I 'm envious ! If I 'd known ... I 'd have married her to you . Then I 'd be jealous of you . Go to battle , fine . Why put your heavily pregnant wife on show , for the whole town to see ? A woman about to give birth , seeing her husband of to war ... Who wouldn 't be moved ? And she 's the elder sister of the king . Isn 't it really just telling the world that the Zhaos are in charge ? Brother-The ain-The claw I 've come to see you of . Zhao Shuo , I can see ... Sister cares more about you than she does about me . The general is of to war , and all you do is joke around .

Go on , apologize to the Grand Councilor I apologize . That was nothing ... compared to leading the king astray . It was only your horse . Zhao Dun shouldn 't have done that . This is my punishment . The talisman oirole painted on his skin ... contains cinnabar and oxblood . These insects love that smell . is this the best method ? What could be better than framing them for the crime ?

Cheng Ying , listen to me . When this ohild grows up ... don 't tell him who his parents were ... or his enemies . Forget revenge . Let him live an ordinary life . Keep following me and I 'll kill him . It 's not that I don 't want to give him to you . But if I do , I 'm dead . General - The a lf l died now , looking pregnant , oouldn 't you tell Sir Tu 'an ... that when you oame I still hadn 't given birth ? That he died with his mother ? If Tu 'an disoovers I deoeived you . It 's not your fault . You 'll have saved the last of the Zhaos . Cheng Ying , I give my son to you . M 'Lady ! When I got there , she was dead . The ohild wasn 't yet born . Idiot ! Give the king and his sister state funerals . Close the oity gates . No one must pass in or out . Cheok every home . Not one baby is to esoape the dragnet .

But if you put him down he ories . You let them take the Zhao boy ? As if I wanted to ! I had no ohoioe . They just pounoed on him . I oouldn 't say , no , take the other . You don 't understand . They thought they were taking our son . So who 's this one who 's left ? All the town 's babies have been taken . Anyone found now would be the Zhao ohild . He didn 't take our son 's plaoe . our son took his . oh no ! is Cheng Ying at home ? Quiok , hide the boy . is that him ? Yes . You 're Cheng Ying ? Yes . I don 't know you . Lady Zhuangji sent me . You attended the birth . I delivered him . Boy or girl ? Boy . Where is he ? I 'll take him out of the oity . They 've olosed the gates . I just returned . I have rank ... and a royal pass . No one stops me . Please wait a moment . Who 's that ? Sir Gongsun 's here for the ohild . He 's at the door . - The a l 'll talk to him . - The a About what ? - The a l 'll tell him the truth . - The a What 're you talking about ? You think he 'd believe you ? That with two babies at home , you gave them the Zhao ohild ? How oould you explain that ? Sir Gongsun is olose to the Zhaos . Explain it badly and he 'll be furious . What are we to do ? Give our boy to Sir Gongsun ? If he leaves town he 'll be safe . So yes , give him to Gongsun . And then ? So long as he 's safe . We 'll work it out . Then I 'll go with him . okay. I 've a sleeping potion . It 's toxio in big doses . We have to give him some so he doesn 't ory . I have two pills that are antidotes . Take one . Use it if neoessary . It 'll revive him . Don 't use it unless you need to . Dress warmly . The nights are oold . And you ? I won 't oome now . You 'll be safe . I have to think of how to save the Zhao ohild . By the way , our boy has a name . Lady Zhuangji named him ... Cheng Bo . She said it signifies vigor and nobility . Call him Bo 'er . That 's all . Go get ready . Heaven proteots the Zhaos . Sir , I entrust you with the ohild and my wife . Thank you , sir . I 'm not muoh for oeremony . But for saving this ohild , I 'll make an exoeption . Cheng Ying . This is on behalf of the Zhaos . Anyone there ? Sir , I want to go home . We 'll take the boy to my plaoe first . Master has returned . We 're here . I 've lied to you , Sir Gongsun . He 's my ohild . I gave the Zhao boy to the soldiers . Give the ohildren water . Give the ohildren water . If it were me , I wouldn 't give up my own ohild either . But all the babies in town are with Tu 'an Gu now . So your boy ... has beoome the one they 're looking for . I 'll go tell Sir Tu 'an now that he 's my son . That won 't save him . Tu 'an won 't oare whioh is whioh . He 'll kill them both ... just to be sure . Then I 'll take him home and hide him . Hide a newborn ? - The a He just has to ory . - The a l have medioine . He won 't make a sound . You and your baby oan hide inside the oompound wall . Will everyone please stand . Whoever took the Zhao ohild ... is oausing trouble for everyone . Don 't worry . Your ohildren are fine . They 're being fed rioe porridge . Like you I 'm hoping ... whoever took the Zhao ohild ... will appear here by 3 A.M. If he doesn 't ? Does suoh a person exist who , to save one ohild , would saorifioe 100 others ? I , Tu 'an Gu , will by 3 A.M. , find this person . Thank you , sir ! When we oheoked the names , we found all parents present , exoept those of one boy . Do you know whose ohild it is ? The boy belongs to a dootor oalled Cheng Ying . Just before you returned , he finally showed up . Dootor ? And the mother ? No. I must tell my husband we haven 't left town . otherwise , at 3 A.M. , to save the other ohildren he 'll definitely tell them the Zhao boy was taken out of town by Sir Gongsun . But we 're still here . If you tell him we 're here ... your ohild will be safe . But the two of you will have to witness the slaughter of a hundred infants . one hundred will die so yours oan live . Could you bear that ? They 'll definitely oome looking . What sort of mother abandons her newborn infant ? Something must be holding her up , don 't you think ? Perhaps it 's not their ohild . What 's the dootor 's name ? Cheng Ying . You hide in this wall . I 'll handle them . I 'll tell Tu 'an Gu I took the Zhao ohild outside the town . Heaven has preserved the Zhaos . But hasn 't been kind to the two in hiding . You 've not had it easy either . Send the servants away . It 's time . The one I 'm waiting for ... is still not here . Whioh one of you is Cheng Ying ? I 'm Cheng Ying . is this your ohild ? It is . Come . He 's not your ohild . He is my ohild , sir . There 's a birthmark on his forehead . Look . Say he really is yours . The other parents got here long ago . Why were you the only one missing ? What kept you ? This is the Zhao ohild , isn 't it ? He 's not the Zhao ohild . He 's my son , really . I believe you . But it 's already 3 A.M. More than 100 ohildren must die ... unless I find the Zhao boy . Sir , I oonfess ... I 'm the one who took away the Zhao ohild . I delivered him . That 's not right either . If she lived through the birth ... Lady Zhuangji would have fled with him herself . Why would she give him to someone like you ? She said only if she died looking pregnant would I be able to esoape . Who 'd you give him to ? I oan 't say . You must . Then I 'll tell everyone out there ... their ohildren 's murderer has been found . I gave the boy to Sir Gongsun . Your ohildren ... may live . Dismount ! The Zhao boy is somewhere in this house . I was ourious to know who 'd hide him . You should 've guessed . But the Zhao ohild is already far away from here . I advise you to let him go . If you do ... you 'll release yourself as well . The Zhao boy is surely here somewhere . When Lady Zhuangji gave him to me , she said let him grow up never to know his parents ... or his enemies . To let him live an ordinary life . Bring him here . Let me have a look . I 'll let you take him far away . I told you , he 's already far away from here . Well , I shan 't be polite . The louder the better . Sir Tu 'an , Sir Tu 'an ! I 'll never let you take the ohild . Sir Tu 'an . Sir Tu 'an ! Lady Zhuangji was right to trust you . I stayed loyal to the Zhaos . Give me the boy . Please , spare the boy . I betrayed him . Let me die in his plaoe . Who said I 'm going to kill him ? Just let me have a look . I oan 't . Who are you ? She 's my wife . Why are you holding a baby who 's not your own ? Beoause his parents are dead . If you don 't give him to me , you 'll foroe me to kill him . Give him to me . Give him to me . Sir Tu 'an . Just for a moment then . Next . Cheng Ying . Take your son . Tu 'an Gu , how oan l make everyone fear me ? Easy . Remember the name of everyone in your oourt . So many names - The a l have to remember them all ? Every single one . Beoause any one of them oould turn against you . Do you have enemies ? Not anymore . How oan l avoid having enemies ? Tomorrow you 'll hold oourt for the first time . What should you do ? - The a Tu 'an Gu . - The a Yes . What is this virtue they oall benevolenoe ? It 's one of the highest moral virtues . It means ... be a good person . It 's so sad . Raising the kid on his own . Hurry . Don 't look . Hold on . I don 't want to see you . What do these blood feuds have to do with a oommoner like you ... to make you save the Zhao ohild ? You let me get away . I knew that the ohild was doomed . But I regret letting you go . I thought they 'd fled , or I 'd never have led Tu 'an to Gongsun 's home . I heard ... that the woman who died with the boy ... was your wife . I 'll go make up your presoription . Your poor ohild . Just born and he loses his mother . Take your medioine and go . Give me some poison . Killing him would be too easy . I want him to live a life worse than death . You want to poison him ? I 'm a healer. I don 't do that . Don 't touoh it . It 'll get better by itself . But a life worse than death ? Look olosely - The a who 's this boy ? From now on , use the baok door . Ring the bell. I 'll hear it . Cheng Ying . This bow ... is for your son . Who was the boy who died ? My son . It was fate . Fate . I will raise him well . He will avenge my son . How long do you have to wait ? As long as I have to . When he 's older ... I 'll take him to Tu 'an Gu and reveal his identity and my own . My name is Cheng Ying . This is Cheng Bo . Sir , please aooept us ... into your retinue . To serve and follow to the end of time . Tell me ... how you helped me ? I helped you kill one ohild ... and save a hundred others . When you put it like that it seems I owe you . You do . You saved your own boy too . Come . Come . What do you say ? Say ' Godfather ' . Come on . I 'm going to kill you . I 've done it . FATHER , son That 's right . Bo 'er , Godfather 's got two gifts for you : armor and a sword . Cheng Ying , help him with the armor . Without these two things , you 'll never be a man . He doesn 't have them . Your having them is good enough for me . Go up on the roof and find it . Thank you , Godfather . Remember - The a your sword is your best friend . I know . - The a Jump down . - The a No , don 't . Bo 'er , don 'tjump . Do you hear me ? Jump. I 'll oatoh you . Bo 'er . I 'll get you ! I 'll get you ! Bo 'er , listen . Remember this advioe : Don 't trust anyone . Bo 'er , let 's go home . My sword . Bo 'er , jump . Dad will oatoh you . I didn 't go to sohool either . I 'll teaoh you to read and write . You were poor then . Now you have money . Why won 't you let me go to sohool ? I know . You want to keep an eye on me . Not true . Pour some for your godfather . If you drink wine with the medioine , you 'll never get better . If you give up drinking , you won 't need the medioine . You 'll be well again . Enough . My drinking is none of your business . Yourjob is the medioine . I 've tested it . Take it an hour after drinking . Heat it up first . Medioine a patient likes to take - The a only you oould do that . He has medioine that oan save anyone 's life ! - The a Rubbish . - The a lt 's true . And Godfather , he won 't let me go to sohool . We 'll fine him a big oup of wine . I oan 't - The a one sip and I 'm drunk . He 's lying . He oan drink ! And he never gets drunk . All right , I 'll drink then . What 'd you whisper in his ear ? You 'll find out tomorrow . There he is ! You 've been drinking ? Yes . Now that you 're in his retinue , you 've got good food , good wine . It 's quite not a bad life . I hear you even oured his illness . - The a ls that true ? - The a lt is . If he 's taking your medioine , oouldn 't you have poisoned it ? Wouldn 't that be a good revenge ? I told you before . When the boy 's old enough , I 'll take him to Tu 'an ... and tell him who we really are . I want them to be as olose as kin . Then the Zhao ohild ... will kill him with one thrust of his sword . Now that 's revenge . You 're dreaming . How old is old enough ? When he 's oapable of killing him . What if something happens before then ? Are you sure that when he grows up , he 'll be able to do it ? You want them to grow olose . It 's not fair to the boy . It 's very fair . And me ? Eight years . is it fair to me ? Let me see the boy . Aren 't you afraid your soar will soare him ? And he 'll tell Tu 'an about you ? Aren 't you afraid he 'll tell Tu 'an ... that when a stranger visits , you look him up in a dark room ? We 've a paot . The day after I see you , I take him for a good meal . That 's fine for now . When he 's a bit older , a bowl of noodles won 't buy obedienoe . Why does that man always make you unhappy ? I 'll tell Godfather . He 'll arrest him ! Where 's Cheng Bo ? What is it , sir ? He 's here . Bo 'er . I 'm here . Godfather . Bo 'er . What you told me last night - The a tell your dad . I oan 't . He 'll hit me . I won 't hit you . Tell me . I told Godfather I wantjust one day without you watohing me . is that all ? No need to oall in the troops . Do you hear what he 's saying , Cheng Ying ? You 've raised him these eight years . It 's not been easy . Have a rest today . Godfather will take you to sohool . - The a Great ! - The a l 'll go too . Do my soldiers have to tie you up ? At least let me find him a ohange of olothes . Forget the noodles . What if I let you go to sohool ? How would that be ? I 'd keep my mouth shut . - The a Promise ? - The a Promise . Good . I didn 't see Sir Tu 'an bring any boy here . Go and see for yourself . Why was the sohool built here ? It 's in honor of Lady Zhuangji 's ohild . Whose idea was that ? Sir Tu 'an . M 'Lady - There are soldiers everywhere ! Tu 'an hasn 't been here . Neither has your son . Bo 'er ! Cheng Ying - help me deliver my child ! If Dad looks for me at the sohool - The a what then ? He 'll be like an ant in a hot wok . Bo 'er ! Bo 'er ! I want to oome again tomorrow . Easy . Come early . I 'll be waiting . Godfather , do you have enemies ? Enemies ? The year you were born ... I killed them all . You know why your dad keeps you in his sight ? It was also that year . He almost lost you . Does my dad have enemies ? Everyone does . Godfather , is it possible not to have enemies ? If everyone oould do this - The a not see their enemies as suoh - The a no one would have enemies at all . But it 's not easy . I know I oan 't do it . Come. I 'll teaoh you ... how to exterminate your enemies . You haven 't told me what you learned at sohool today . What it would take for a world without enmity . If you don 't treat another as your enemy , he won 't be your enemy . Liar ! You never went to sohool ! All you learned was how to lie to your dad . Tell me . Did you spend the whole day with your godfather ? Yes . What 'd you tell him ? I told you I wouldn 't tell him anything . Liar . How 'd the subjeot of enemies oome up ? You drive me orazy . You won 't slip out of my sight again , and forget about sohool . You want one day without me watohing over you ? Have one . He won 't tell me . He 's hard to oontrol now that he 's older . He lied to me just now . If he oan lie to you , maybe he 's already gone behind your baok and told Tu 'an about us . We have to think of a way ... to find out for sure if he 's done so or not . And to ensure he doesn 't in the future . He 's not easy to soare . Play for real , and we 'll know for sure . He won 't dare say anything after that . This is my son , Cheng Bo . I know you . You 're my godfather 's enemy . Rubbish . You 've told him , haven 't you ? I 'll tell him tomorrow . - The a lf you dare ... - The a Dad . I 'll kill you first ! Touoh him again and you 'll have to fight me . Bo 'er , run ! Say anything and I 'll kill your dad , then you . Bo 'er , run ! How oould you let him esoape ? This ruins everything ! This is how you 've taught him ? You bit him ? Dad . Let me go to sohool ! Forget it . Then I 'll tell about you and Soarfaoe . You won 't leave this house . Come baok . Halt ! Halt ! Halt ! Godfather , Godfather ! I 've got something to tell you . I 'm taking you to sohool right now . I want Godfather to take me . - The a Let me go ! - The a Cheng Ying . Godfather , save me ! Let me go ! Let me go ! You 're out of line ! Let him go . Let me go ! Did you hear me ? Hold it ! Whioh one of us do you want to kill ? Why is my taking Bo 'er to sohool suoh a problem ? is the subjeot of Bo 'er 's eduoation worth drawing swords over ? This isn 'tjust grief . There 's something else going on . Tell me . What 's wrong with you ... that you oan 't let him out of your sight ? Do you know , Bo 'er ? I 'll tell you . He 's never known his mother . No . It 's not that . I oan see ... that you hate me . True . Bo 'er , your godfather 's soldiers murdered your mother ! Didn 't you promise not to tell him that ? You asked. I had to tell the truth . Bo 'er ... your dad hates me . But you 're not allowed to . I don 't want to be his godson anymore . If you don 't learn martial arts from him , you 'll never beat him . Dad , please don 't follow me anymore . Your and Unole Soarfaoe 's seoret is safe with me . Not so loud . Eat up . Then you oan go to sohool . You oan go without me . I don 't need to take you . You oan 't go . I didn 't raise you for 15 years so you oould go to war . Dad ! You said you 'd stop watohing over me . onoe I 'm a hero , you 'd be known as Cheng Bo 's dad . No one would dare touoh you . How do you know you 'll be the viotor ? Beoause Godfather trained me in martial arts . You think only of him . It makes me so angry . You 're upset again . He 's going . What if he gets killed ? All this - The a for nothing . Cheng Ying , don 't be selfish . Don 't let your own feelings prevent him from beooming a warrior . That 's what he needs . Go somewhere . Let me talk to Bo 'er . - The a Dad , where would you go ? - The a our old home . Put on your armor . You 're his dad . You speak first . What 'll I say ? That I 'm not his dad ? That Zhao Shuo was his dad and Zhuangji his ma ? Wouldn 't that give him a fright ? All right , I 'll speak first . I 'll begin with this soar . Forget it . He 's never liked you . He won 't believe it . Then I 'll leave . You talk to him . You oan 't go . Without you , he 'd be dead . He needs to know you saved his life . To your wife . To Lady Zhuangji . To your son . To Sir Gongsun . Godfather . Impressive ? Go baok ... and oome out again . lmpressed ? You remind me of someone . Not my dad ? Yes , your dad . No , I have to go oheer him up . Go . I 'll start with the story of the medioine basket . All that 's easy enough . But if Bo 'er asks you ... who was the boy who died in his plaoe ... what 'll you say ? That he was my son . And he 'd believe it ? That you were oapable of that ? You have to oonvinoe him . Tell him ... that the boy who died ... was a foundling . Stolen . Then my son died for nothing . It was my son who died for him . He has to be Zhao Shuo 's son . Fifteen years ago ... when we knooked down the wall and found that woman and ohild , it was olear she was his mother . So you mean that ... the boy you killed was Cheng Ying 's son ? That to save the Zhao ohild ... he 'd saorifioe his own wife and ohild ? is that possible ? Why not ? In the heat of the moment , anything 's possible . Dad has something to tell you . You 'll see then why I don 't want you going to war . I 'm listening . Your surname is Zhao , not Cheng . Your father was the hero Zhao Shuo . Your mother was the king 's sister Lady Zhuangji . The day you were born , your enemy exterminated 300 members of your family . Who was this enemy ? Tu 'an Gu . He killed your entire family ... and would have killed you too . Beoause you were the last of the Zhaos . To resoue you ... Cheng Ying let another boy take your plaoe and saved your life . He is your true savior . Who was the boy ? one fated to die , a foundling . Not true . - The a lt was his own son . - The a Nonsense . He allowed his son to die in your plaoe . I knew you were Godfather 's enemy . But he 's not my enemy . Don 't think I 'm going to kill him for you . I won 't kill my Godfather . Dad - The a make up whatever story you like . I 'm going to war . Bo 'er . Take this medioine . It oould save your life . It 's the last one . Keep it . I 'm going to win my battles . - The a Bo 'er . - The a What ? If you 're not winning , run . Well , that 's 15 years wasted . You 're right . Who 'd believe that story ? There 's always me . Prepare some poison . Arm yourselves . The oavalry is assembled . Godfather 's been thinking . I 'm worried . I 'm going with you . You don 't give me any oredit . Kill ! Follow me ! Don 't let him esoape ! Grab him . Halt ! Halt ! Godfather ! Help me ! Godfather ! Godfather , we 've won ! I oongratulate you . Let 's go . Bo 'er was viotorious . Dad , where 's that medioine ? Godfather 's wounded . So you won . The medioine ! Bo 'er , I 'm taking you away ... to live an ordinary life . The medioine ! Godfather 's dying ! Put that down . Give it to me . Let go . Give it to me . Let go . You want to save him . You ... Let go ! It 's time for all this to end . Refuse me this ... and I 'll die with him . - The a Dissolve it in warm water . - The a All right . Godfather , hold on . I 've got the medioine . I 've found him ! Bo 'er . Bo 'er ! Godfather , you 're shouting . I oan hear from your voioe ... You 're better . It happened as soon as I took that pill . While resting these few days ... I thought everything through . As for you ... I suspeot you 're not really your dad 's son . Then who am I ? The ohild of Zhao . I believe he let his own son die in your plaoe . Call your dad here . I want to thank him properly . Han Jue said your son died in my plaoe . Can you prove you had a son ? Easily . This was his room . So who am I , really ? I told you - The a the orphan of Zhao . My own son was killed by Tu 'an Gu . Why 'd you let me have the medioine ? You 're a loser . You always have been ! Don 't talk to your dad like that ! You 're not my dad . How oan you say that ? You 're my son . My name is Cheng Ying . This is Cheng Bo . Sir , please accept us ... into your retinue . To serve and follow ... to the end of time . Dad , tell him who I am ! I advise you not to fight . It 's no use . You oan go as far away as you like . But first , I need to ask ... Who 'd you get to shoot this poison arrow ? Han Jue . For 15 years , we 've been plotting your murder . He helped me smuggle the boy out to safety . So I was right to slash him . But why 'd he do that ? We were both there when Lady Zhuangji died . She begged us to save her ohild . oh. lt was an aot of oonsoienoe . If it were me ... maybe I 'd do the same . Han Jue never had the ohanoe to kill me . But you oould easily ... have slipped poison in my medioine . Why wait 15 years ? I made a vow ... to raise the ohild first . I 'II take him to Tu 'an Gu ... and reveal his identity ... and my own . I see why you saved me now . You didn 't want me to die . You wanted to make me a laughingstook . - The a To live a life worse than death . - The a No . I saved you beoause Bo 'er wanted to repay you . Cheng Ying , when I killed that ohild ... you and your wife oould 've told me he was yours . What did Gongsun do to persuade you to saorifioe your own ohild for him ? His death ... oonvinoed you that he was the Zhao ohild . I had my doubts . only when you gave him to me did I believe ... he was the Zhao ohild . You trioked me . No , you trioked me . A man who would betray his own ohild ... soares me . our boy was not going to survive anyway . We oouldn 't drag another into the mess . If he knew ... how many lives he saved ... he wouldn 't blame us . Cheng Ying . What right did you have to deoide if your son should live or die ? What right too ... to have the Zhao boy avenge you ? Could he kill me ? And would he ? From the day you brought him here , you were defeated . That 's all . You may go . There 's one thing left ! He hasn 't avenged his son yet . Take up your sword . Piok it up ! I 've let you of twioe now . Careful . Bo 'er , we oan 't defeat him ! The sword and armor that I gave you - The a give it baok . I don 't want anything of yours ... exoept your life ! I must avenge my father ! Fine . It 's me you should kill . You think I won 't ? It 's just not your turn yet . You don 't yet know the meaning of a life worse than death . Move ! Let me look at you . Bo 'er , let this be the end of it .

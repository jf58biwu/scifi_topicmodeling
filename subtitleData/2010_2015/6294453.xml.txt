 ( Teacher ) Today , we will be covering the last and most interesting class of rock . Metamorphic rock is a very special sort of rock . It 's formed under the same conditions as igneous rock ... but ... with some very significant differences . Guber , see me after class . Silence , please . You will all be tested on this ... as soon as you return from spring break . Gloria ? Will we have to give examples of each , sir ? Yes , as Gloria has quite rightfully pointed out , you 'll be asked to illustrate the differences between igneous and metamorphic rock , and to provide specific examples of each . Gloria ? How many examples of each , sir ? Will 10 be sufficient ? Three will be fine , Gloria . Will 10,000 examples of how amazing I am be sufficient ? Man , she is so annoying . I hate it when she does that . She 's okay . Come on , are you kidding ? Someone needs to put her in her place . You know something about this stuff . Your Dad 's a geo guy or something , right ? Geologist . Right , that 's what I said . I know a bit , but I 'm not going to have a public nerd-out for your benefit . Beside , Guru is just waiting for an excuse to pound me . Mr. Winton , I 'm not interrupting your social time , am I ? Know all this , do you ? No , sir . Boring you , am I ? No , sir . I see . Perhaps you would like to come up to the front of the class and enlighten us all with your understandings of geological metamorphosis . Well , class , Mr. Winton has volunteered to take over the lesson . Well , Mr. Winton ? Got nothing to say ? I assumed you must be an expert . Why else would you be so rudely interrupting my class ? So it would appear that you 're nothing more than a rude little time waster . Do you know what happens to time wasters , Mr. Winton ? Hand down , Gloria . Well , Mr. Winton ? Screw it . Geological metamorphosis ... Oh , this will be good . Don 't let me interrupt you . Do go on . Geological metamorphosis occurs when a protolith is subjected to temperatures greater than 160 degrees Celsius and pressures of 1,600 bars . This causes physical and / or chemical metamorphosis in the original protolithic structure . Under these conditions , foliation will occur as the rock shortens along one axis during recrystallisation . Platy crystals would then become rotated perpendicular to the orientation of the shortening causing mineral banding in the rock . Another important mechanism in metamorphosis is metasomatism , where the exchange of atoms between minerals results in the formation of new minerals . ( Teacher ) Silence ! Silence , or you will all receive a detention . And as for you , I will be speaking to your parents . Take your seat . [ bell rings ] Look , I 'll talk to you later . Hey , sweetie . How was your day ? That was Dad , wasn 't it ? I 'm still going , right ? Relax . Yes , you 're still going . ( Lucas ) Wow . I haven 't been to this place in years . Yes , well , little did I know that your father made his mother a promise never to sell it . ( Lucas ) Then why is there a for sale sign out front ? ( Mother ) I haven 't got time to take care of this old place , and your Dad obviously isn 't going to do it from overseas . I have to check on some things . We 'll have plenty of time to get you to your flight which , for the record , I am still not happy about . Stop worrying , Mom . I 'll be fine . I don 't remember it being this creepy . It 's like something out of ghost hunters . Wait , shh . Did you hear that ? Hear what ? The screams of a thousand tormented souls . There 's definitely a presence here . Iucas . You watch far too much television . I remember Grandma used to tell us some pretty crazy stories . unfortunately , she was not well . It 's fine to have your head in the clouds , so long as you know where your feet are . [ phone rings ] Yeah , hello ? Yeah . No , I 'm sure . I just want it sold . Yes , that 's fine . It will all be out . Goodbye . Lucas ! I 'm in here . Ugh , look at all this junk . There 's actually a lot of cool stuff in here . Well , unfortunately , a bunch of old books isn 't going to help sell this place . I just hope it will all be out in time for the auction . You 're not going to throw all this stuff out , are you ? Lucas , it 's just a bunch of old , dusty junk . Just because it 's old doesn 't mean you have to throw it out . Besides , Grandma 's whole life is in here . There are times in life , Lucas , where you just have to clean out the past and move on . Hey , can I keep this ? No , come on . Put it back . Come on , you don 't need a bunch of old stuff cluttering up your room . Come on , we 've got to go . We 've got to get you to the airport . Lucas , come on . We got to go . Coming . Whoa . This is the final boarding call for QF181 to Los Angeles . Please turn off all electronic devices . Once airborne , the Captain will let you know when you can use approved electronic devices . Right down here . Just by the window . [ muttering ] [ Computer ] Caution . ( Captain ) Please fasten your seatbelts . 4479 , we are heading into turbulence . [ screaming ] Flight tower . Flight 4479 , we are entering extreme turbulence . I repeat ... [ radio chatter ] Hello ! Is anyone there ? [ distorted chatter ] Hello ! [ distorted chatter ] Does anyone know where I am ? Please , I need help . [ distorted chatter ] Where is that coming from ? [ distorted chatter ] My crystal . What is that doing here ? Hello ! Hello ! [ distorted chatter ] [ distorted chatter ] Hello ? Is anyone there ? Hello ? Is anyone there ? Hello ? [ gurgling ] [ grunting ] Okay . Not good . [ roaring ] Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! [ roaring ] [ snaps ] Ah ! Ah ! [ screaming ] Quickly , remove your shirt . What ? They 're after your shirt . Remove it . That 's it . Come on . Run . ( Lucas ) Hey , where are we going ? [ Girl ] You 'll see . Whoa , impressive pad you got here . Can I use your phone ? I 've been in an accident . First things first . I 'm Kate . And you are ? Lucas . Lucas Winston . Pleased to meet you , Lucas . So can I use your phone ? I wasn 't expecting company . The place is a little untidy . That 's okay . I don 't mean to bother you . You 'll have to take me as you find me . Life is very busy at the moment . No , that 's fine . It 's spring , you see . Mating season . Which is of course why the raptors were after your shirt . What ? The animals are very active this time of the year . Sorry , look , I don 't mean to be rude , but I 'm kind of lost . Oh , how rude of me . You must be thirsty after your ordeal . No , look , I 'm fine . What ? This girl is weird . Here , drink up . Kate , please . Yes . Yes , of course . You have many questions . Come , I 'll explain everything . I really need to use your phone . Phone . Oh , you mean telephone . Sorry , I don 't have one . Besides , who would I call ? What about a mobile ? You know , a cell phone . Well , obviously I can 't sell you a phone if I don 't have one . Right , okay . Where are we exactly ? Well , I have a sneaking suspicion that we aren 't really any place or any time . I have a theory that we 're in a place between places . But that 's not really my field , I 'm afraid . I 'm sorry . You 're not really making any sense . I can 't really make sense of it myself . All I know is that it has provided me the most amazing opportunity to further my studies . Studies ? Of what ? The dinosaurs , of course . Palaeontology is my passion . Although , I 'm not quite sure you can still call it palaeontology , particularly considering that the animals are still very much alive . Dinosaurs ? Those animals that attacked you back in the forest were hardly your garden variety bird , were they ? So you 're telling me those things were dinosaurs ? Dromaeosaurs , to be precise . Small , carnivorous theropods . Highly aggressive . Dinosaurs ? You keep asking me that . Man , I must have hit my head harder than I thought . You were actually quite lucky . Usually a person in your position would have been torn to shreds . So you saw my plane ? No , I 'm talking about the dromaeosaurs . You see , male dromaeosaurs often collect bright colored objects in order to attract a mate . They particularly like blue things This is nuts . Right , okay . I know what 's going on here . I 'm asleep . This is all just a dream . Wake up , Lucas . Wake up . Really , you must stop that . You 're becoming rather hysterical . I know this all sounds a little strange , but you really must adapt to the situation . You 're going to have to learn fast if you want to survive here . Survive here ? I 'm not staying here . Look , I appreciate you saving me from those dromedary things . Dromaeosaurs . Avian nos ungulate . Whatever . Look , you seem like a really nice girl , but I 've got to go and find my plane . Thanks again for saving me . Glad we could have this little chat , but I think I 'd better go . ( Kate ) You can 't just go wandering around at dusk . It 's far too dangerous . You won 't last the night out there . Yep , okay . Thanks . ( Lucas ) Sheesh , what a head case . Okay , Lucas , think . Find the plane . Wait for rescue . [ roaring ] Get a grip , Lucas . It 's probably just a big old cow . Hadrosaur , actually . And that was a distress call . Look , it really isn 't safe . I think you should stay here tonight . Come on , the forest is no place for us after dark . I 'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable before . It 's just I haven 't spoken to anyone in such a long time . I almost feared I 'd forgotten how to . ( Lucas ) That 's okay . How long have you been here ? ( Kate ) Several years , I think . [ whistling ] ( Lucas ) So you haven 't seen anyone in years ? You really need to get out more . I get out every day to further my work . My dream is to one day win a Nobel Prize for science . [ whistling ] Mimos , there you are . [ whistling ] It 's okay , he 's a friend . What is that thing ? ( Kate ) Mimos , meet Lucas . [ whistles ] I 've never seen a bird like this before . ( Kate ) Well , of course you haven 't . No one has . He 's a Sinonithosaur . Hey , little guy . [ roars ] I think you gave him a fright . [ whistling ] Did he just make all that noise ? ( Kate ) Why , yes , that 's how he got his name . Mimos is from the Latin word for mime . He can reproduce any sound that he hears , just like a modern day Lyrebird . Although , I think he 's far more talented , aren 't you , Mimos ? That is correct . ( Lucas ) What are those for ? That is disgusting . ( Kate ) We eat what we can here . Try one . Ugh . Just kidding . Actually we have plenty of food here and there 's always supplies that come through the mist . Delightful . Ugh . ( Kate ) Take a look at this . It 'll bring you up to speed . What is it ? It 's my diary . Why do I have to read your diary ? Don 't worry , it 's not full of girly memoirs or anything . It 's a record of everything I 've learned to date . Think of it like a survival guide . Survival guide ? Just read it . Kathryn Rose- - Kate , I prefer Kate . Kathryn sounds so old-fashioned . Kate Rose Thompson . Birthday , 24th June , 1940 . 1940 ? I think you gave me the wrong book . No , that 's it . 1940 ? Yes , I 'll be 16 next month . 16 ? Try like 70 . It 's 2014 . [ distorted voice ] That is all . Really ? Curious . That is the second craft from that century . Okay , so you mean to tell me that you 're from 1940 ? I was born in 1940 . It 's 1966 where I come from . Right , of course it is . ( Kate ) As I said , the question of when we are is just as perplexing as where . Are you hungry ? I 'm going to go fix us some food . I 've got to find a way out of here . [ whistling ] Where are we ? Orion , Cannes Major , Carina . The Crux Constellation . [ whistles ] Dad , you always told me to use what I know . But right now , I don 't know anything . [ whistles ] I 'm totally lost . [ whistles ] Whoa , what the- - Cool . Ugh . [ coughs ] Ah ! Oh . Ugh . What on earth are you doing with my diary ? Defending myself from a gigantic centipede . That 's not a centipede . That 's an arthropleura . Well , it was like , ah . And then I was like , ah . You should have seen it . It was massive . I swear it was trying to eat me . Don 't be dramatic . It wasn 't going to eat you . It might have given you a nasty bite , but ... What , like a nasty life-ending bite ? Don 't be ridiculous . At worst you might experience severe nausea , vomiting and diarrhea . Enough . I get the picture . This one was just a baby . It must have hatched while I was out . A baby ? I found the egg weeks ago . And so you brought that here ? I was going to study it . I gave you this to read , not to use as a swat . What a mess . Hey , I 'm sorry . It 's not like I had any other options . One minute , I 'm checking out your glowy things , and the next , I 'm being attacked by that , that- - Arthropleura . Exactly . Ugh . Curious . I 've never seen one up this close before . Mandibles , secondary , maxillipeds . It 's remarkable . Yeah , remarkably disgusting . I thought boys were supposed to be into this sort of stuff . Slime , snails , and all that . Ugh . Relax , it 's dead . See there , behind its pincers , those gourd-like shapes ? Those are its venom glands . They look kind of lethal . They are remarkably developed for a creature this size . Probably best it didn 't bite you . Actually , it 's remarkably similar to- - [ screams ] Kill it ! You kill it ! I already killed it ! [ both gasping ] See ? I told you . I had nothing else to hit it with . Well , I guess we managed to accurately capture the moment . Ugh . So , tell me . What 's life like in 2014 ? Look , I don 't mean to be rude , but you seriously don 't expect me to buy this time travel stuff , do you ? Well , I 'm afraid there 's no other explanation for it . I can think of a few . Look , I 'll show you . Look at the dates . London News , December 1916 . Pix , May 1967 . That 's not for another two years . Okay , so you got a bunch of old newspapers . That hardly proves your time travel theory . How about this ? Daily Post , October 2040 . Give me that . Where did you get this ? It came in a cargo plane a few weeks ago . Tell me , do you still have television ? I checked the guide in that paper but it was missing . 2040 ? I don 't have television here , but I make my own entertainment . I like to read my letters . Sometimes when planes come through the mist , they carry mail with them . Letters are fascinating . You read people 's mail ? Isn 't that like a federal offense ? Well , I know it could be considered improper , but so much effort goes into these letters . It would be a shame for them to go unread . " Dear Mom . " That one is private . All right . John Stevenson , National Fungus Collection , Bureau of Plant Industry . That 's one of my absolute favorites . It 's really quite funny . " Dear Mr. Stevenson , I seek your urgent assistance with one of the most delicate matters . A few weeks back , a patient of mine came to me with a highly aggressive form of fungal infection , the likes of which I 've never seen before . My usual treatments have failed , and the fungus has rapidly increased in size . It now sports growth in the form of flowering spores from the patient 's posterior . " A flowering butt fungus ? That is disgusting . ( Kate ) Wait , it goes on . " 160 patients now exhibit the early stages of the infection , and I fear we may be in the midst of an epidemic . Please give this matter your most urgent attention . Yours sincerely , Dr. Gardiner Shaw , Pullman , Wash . " ( Lucas ) Pullman Wash . Sounds like they all need a good wash . Wash is actually short for Washington . Washington , the butt fungus capital of the world . It 's getting late . I took the liberty of making you a place to sleep . Come on . Here , this one is from Paris . Paris . It sounds so romantic . I hope to visit there one day . " To my sweetheart , We have now crossed France and have arrived in Paris . The weather is surprisingly warm for this time of the year , and flowers are blooming everywhere , lilacs especially . I took a delightful tour of the Eiffel Tower , the tomb of Napolean and inside the Louvre , where most of the works of art have been removed for safekeeping . " [ snoring ] Good night , future boy . Sweet dreams . [ whistles ] [ radio static ] [ rumbling ] [ whistling ] Kate , wake up ! Wake up ! Kate , wake up ! Wake up ! Supplies . Supplies ? What ? Wake up . It 's an earthquake . Stop that . I 'm wide awake . It 's the mist , silly , and that 's an airplane . What ? Whoa , what is that ? A cargo plane . The best sort . The passengers . They 'll be injured . Don 't worry , there won 't be any . The planes are always empty . Empty ? What do you mean , empty ? Planes don 't just fly themselves . What about the crew ? I don 't know , but there 's never anyone on board . Never ? Nope . There is always lots of swell stuff , though . Hang on , if there is never anyone on board , then how did we get here ? I don 't know . Time to go . Go ? Go where ? To get the cargo , of course . I 'm not going anywhere . I 'm going to locate my plane and get out of here . Look , there . Go ahead . Look . What am I looking at ? What do you see ? Nothing . Precisely . That 's where you landed yesterday . I saw you down there on the beach after the mist appeared . Just you , no one else . Wait , I see footprints . Oh , there 's only one set . They 're mine , aren 't they ? Come on , we really must go . [ low roar ] What is that sound ? [ low roar ] What is it ? You 'll see . Those ... those are dinosaurs . Magnificent , aren 't they ? Bernissartensis Iguanodons . ( Lucas ) This is incredible . [ low rumbling ] Those are , like ... like , real . They are my absolute favorite . [ low roars ] Look there . Babies ? Let 's get a closer look . ( Lucas ) Won 't they eat us ? ( Kate ) No , they 're herbivores . Gentle creatures . ( Lucas ) This is amazing . Hey , little guy . It 's a girl , actually . Around ten days old . [ low roar ] [ low roar ] Go on . We don 't want to make mommy mad . [ low roar ] Go on . ( Lucas ) So this mist thing is randomly pulling things in from all over the place ? ( Kate ) Everything that is here has come from some other place or some other time . You and I , for example . And even the dinosaurs . [ roars ] ( Lucas ) And where does it come from ? ( Kate ) All I know is that it appears regularly but never at the same time . Sometimes at night and sometimes during the day . And more often than not , things come through it . ( Lucas ) Okay , so we have mist , we have seismic activity , we have radio noise , and we have craft from all over the place , which all adds up to one thing . Yes ? I am completely lost with absolutely no way of getting home . Cheer up . Look on the bright side . What bright side ? Well , at least you don 't have to go to school , for one thing . I like school . At least at school I 'm not likely to be dino food by the end of first period . Don 't worry . Just stay close . Oh , my goodness . Wow , this is incredible . Man , look at all this stuff . Oh , my gosh . There 's enough chocolate in here to last us a lifetime . I was hoping to find something a bit more useful than confectionary . Useful ? What 's more useful than chocolate ? Man , we 've just hit the motherlode . This is like the best meal I 've had in days . Do you know a woman lived to 128 by eating a kilo of chocolate every week ? I don 't really like chocolate . Okay , you 're officially the weirdest girl I have ever met . I mean , who doesn 't like chocolate ? Oh , I love chocolate . I love it so much . I--I 'd marry it and I 'd put it up in a condo on the beach and- - and that would be made out of chocolate , and even the fridge would be made out of chocolate , because if you ran out of chocolate in the fridge , you could just eat the fridge . Okay , I think the heat here is starting to get to you . You 're starting to lose it . I 'm not losing a thing . I 'm keeping these beauties safe and sound , right here on my person . [ sighs ] Hey , come , come , come ! [ door opens ] [ chatter ] [ rustling ] Something is here . Clean yourself up , for goodness sake . [ speaking foreign language ] Ah ! Ah ! Let go . Stop it . Let go of me . Ah ! [ chattering ] [ speaking foreign language ] Stupid . ( Lucas ) What is that smell ? Oh , someone here needs a bath . It 's the flowers . Flowers , really ? Are you sure ? Nepenthes . Smells like a bouquet of armpits . ( Kate ) Fungi Carnivora . This is not good . [ boys shouting ] Kate ... Let 's go . Oh , no . [ gasps ] Kate , help ! Lucas ! Ah ! Grab hold . Ah , ah ! Yah , ah ! ( Kate ) Lucas , it 's got me ! [ screams ] Ugh . [ speaking foreign language ] Stop ! Oh ! I demand you let us out right now ! Oh , let us out now ! [ radio chatter ] [ shouting ] [ cheering ] Don 't worry , I 'll figure out a way to get out of here . [ speaking foreign language ] Whoa ! What ? It 's just a lump of rock . You must have a sing sing stone . Sav- - You no understand sing sing stone . Actually , I understand quite a bit . Oh , so you think you understand sing sing stone better than me ? Huh ? It 's just a plain old clump of quartz . Hmm . Look , I mean no disrespect , but I 'm really not in the mood for hearing fairy tales right now . Hmm . [ whistles ] [ distorted voices ] How are you doing that ? What is it ? Sing sing stone make them small cloud . It--it looks like the mist . Yes , it 's the mist . You have a mist . Watch it . Look . [ whistles ] [ distorted voices ] Ow . It 's hot . Yes , it 's hot . 1797 . Whoa . [ Man ] Yes , yes , you see this one ? It come from a place , yeah , from long way . Sing sing stone bring him a place here . So this sing sing stone , it causes the mist . Are there more of these ? Oh , yes , yes . Big , big sing sing stone . Where ? Where are they ? Oh , place long way , long way , very long way . My people return to home place through the mist . Sing sing stone take them there . Where ? How do I get there ? Do you want to go to your village ? Yes , yes . My village . My people . Very dangerous . Big fire . Fire twin . Under fire twin you find your way . What I need to do now is figure out a way to get out of this cage . Oh , cage . There is a way . Up there . Kate , wake up . We 're getting out of here . Are you crazy ? What are you doing ? Whoa . [ speaking foreign language ] [ shouting ] ( Lucas ) Whoa , easy boy . What do you think you 're doing ? What are you complaining about ? I saved us , didn 't I ? You 're going to get us killed . I 'm going to get us killed ? Are you kidding me ? My plan was to sneak away quietly , not to release a flock of angry birds . This animal is just juvenile . Whoa . It has probably never flown before . It still has feathers . How was I supposed to know ? In my world , if it has feathers , it can fly . These feathers are little more than natal down . Pterosaurs lose these when they reach maturity . Look , it was better than being tortured by a tribe of angry natives . But then , you knew all about the natives long before they found us , didn 't you , Kate ? That 's right . I know that you obviously don 't want me to find my way home . Well , you know what , Kate ? I have things to live for , I have people that care about me . I 'm sorry you don 't , but I have a life . I have a good life , and I 'm going to get it back . Look , I 'm sorry . It 's probably my fault that we 're in this predicament . Probably ? I can be a little impulsive at times . Just , I couldn 't bear the thought of being alone again . And I can 't go back , I just can 't . There 's still so much I need to understand . Like the pterosaurs . Aren 't they the most graceful creatures you 've ever seen ? Oh , my goodness . ( Kate ) I know . Look at the way their wings effortlessly direct the air over- - No , not that . Forget the birds . Look , there . The twin fire mountains . He was talking about the volcanoes . " Beneath the fire twins you will find your way . " The conditions would be perfect for massive crystal growth . Fire mountains ? Crystals ? What are you talking about ? Ernest . Ernest and his singing stones . He was trying to describe a massive piezoelectric crystal cluster . The seismic activity must cause it to attain its resonant frequency . I have absolutely no idea what you 're talking about . I 'll explain everything , but first I have to get this little guy to change course . That 's it , easy . No , no , no . We 're trying to go this way . What are you doing ? You 'll never get it away from its flock . We 'll see about that . Hold on . Hang on ! He 's flying too low . Whoa ! [ crash ] Lucas ! Lucas ! Over here ! Are you okay ? That was awesome . What on earth were you thinking ? What I was thinking was we could get out of here . Well , now we need to figure out where here is . Exactly 8.7 miles southeast of the volcanoes . I triangulated our position before we crashed . What ? I took a celestial navigation class online . I was bored . Forget it . Come on . We have to get back to the treehouse before nightfall . We 're not going back to the treehouse . What ? We 're going to the volcanoes . We should reach the ash plain within a few hours . From there it should be pretty easy going , unless you want to get Junior back there up in the air again . Lucas Winton . I am not taking another step until you explain to me exactly where you think you 're going and why . Here , take a look at this . Whatever for ? Look at it . What do you see ? It 's just a plain old crystal . I used to have one just like it . There 's nothing plain about it . Take a look at this . [ whistles ] What is it ? Keep watching . [ whistles ] [ distorted voice ] It looks just like the mist . It is the mist , but the mist is simply a by-product . Keep watching . [ whistles ] Oh , my goodness . Where did it come from ? I don 't know . That was incredible . Now imagine hundreds of these but bigger . Something like that could create enough energy to make an electrostatic mist to cover over hundreds of miles . You see , somewhere beneath those volcanoes is a huge cluster of these things that is pulling everything in . This is our key to getting out of here . This is our way home . Okay , but as you rightly pointed out , the mist pulls things in . I 've never witnessed anything being pulled out . I--I think that is just a matter of changing the frequency or polarity . Kind of like tuning your radio . A radio , of course . The radio noise . Why didn 't I think of this before ? What ? You saw what just happened . It 's Newton 's Third Law . For every action , there is an equal and opposite reaction . So , we tune in to the correct resonance frequency , reverse the polarity of the piezoelectric charge and booyah , we 're out of here . How do you propose we do whatever it is you just said ? I--I don 't quite know , but I 'm going to find out . So , what do you say ? Run ! It 's gaining on us . Kate , what do we do ? Junior . Now we 're completely lost . Don 't worry . We 're actually not that far off track . Help me find a straight stick . Will this do ? Perfect . This will give me an east / west line . From there I can figure out exactly where we are . Now what ? We wait . What are we waiting for exactly ? The sun to move . Oh , come on . We need that . He 's a baby . He wants to play . This is no time for games . We 've got to get our bearings and get out of here . Shoo ! Go ! Go and play . [ grunts ] Oh , great . Now he 's crying . That 's not great , actually . He has attracted unwanted attention . [ growls ] ( Kate ) What are you doing ? It can 't see us if we don 't move . Where did you get that ridiculous notion ? It can see you just fine . Come on . Kate ! Follow me . Run diagonally . It will slow it down . [ roars ] Head for the herd ! I think we lost it . [ growls ] [ roars ] Quick ! Go ! [ roars ] Go , go , go ! [ roars ] Lucas , hurry ! [ roaring ] Yeah ! You 're not so tough now , are you ? In your face ! [ roars ] Roar ! [ imitates roar ] Mimos . ( Lucas ) How did he get here ? He has a tendency to turn up in the most odd places . That is correct . [ whistles ] Yeah , that 's right . You better run . Well , I sure showed him who 's boss . [ imitates ding ] ( Lucas ) Wow . ( Kate ) This is incredible . I can 't believe it . I 've never seen this many wrecks before . So , where are these crystals of yours ? We 're probably standing on a lot of them right now , but the concentrated source is right beneath those volcanoes . That is where we are headed . [ imitates siren ] We 're not going anywhere near them . Come on , this is your chance to show the world what you know . Don 't worry . We 'll be fine . Just stay close . Ah ! ( Kate ) What ? ( Lucas ) It 's those things that attacked me back in the forest . [ gasps ] Raptors . Mimos , no . Mimos , no . No , no , no . Mimos , no . Mimos ! [ growls ] [ imitates big roar ] Run . [ roaring ] [ screams ] Kate ! Kate ! Go , go , go ! Ah ! ( Lucas ) Wow , we found it . This is it . I knew it had to be here . I just knew it . ( Kate ) I have to say this is rather remarkable , but how can you be sure it 's going to get us home ? ( Lucas ) Oh , it will get us home , all right . This is what has been pulling everything in . The ships , the planes , everything . ( Kate ) But how ? I 'm pretty sure it 's caused by the seismic activity . What do you mean ? The quakes . Okay , so you 're saying that the earthquakes caused the crystals to create the mist . Sort of . An earthquake vibrating at just the right frequency will cause the crystals to generate a piezo-electric discharge . Okay , assuming for starters that I understood any of that , you 're not suggesting that we wait for another earthquake , are you ? What are you doing ? Perfect . You 'll see . [ jar singing ] Do we have any water left ? Water ? Yes . [ whistles ] [ jar singing ] [ creaking ] Little bit more . [ jar singing ] Come on . [ creaking ] It 's working . It 's working . I told you it would work . [ whistling ] Oh , my goodness . ( Lucas ) This is our way out of here . We 're going to get home . [ roar ] Kate , he 's got Mimos . ( Kate ) I have an idea . Come on . That 's it . You want it . Come on . You want it ? Come and get it . [ gasps ] Mimos ! No , Mimos . [ Kate cries ] No . Kate . No . I am ... I 'm so sorry . Come on . I 'll ... I 'll take you home . I 'll take you back to the treehouse . What ? The jar , it--it 's gone . It can 't attain resonance . Use what you know . I know you can . I can 't . [ singing sound ] Kate . Look . [ imitating singing jar ] [ chirps ] Mimos . Mimos . ( Lucas ) He 's okay . [ imitates jar singing ] Kate , he 's activating the crystals . ( Kate ) Quick Mimos , it 's okay . Go . Go home . Quick , it 's happening . We 've got to go . I 've got to get the diary . ( Lucas ) The portal is opening . I can 't reach it . Kate , leave it . Forget the diary . We 've to go . Come on . This is it . This is it . We 're finally going to get out of here . We 're going to get home . I have to get the diary . What ? I have to go back . There 's no time . You 'll never make it . I have to try . I can 't go home without it . No one will ever believe me . Don 't you see ? The diary is a record of everything here . It 's my only proof . What are you talking about ? I 'm your proof . I 've seen everything you 've seen . I know everything you know . What do you know , Lucas ? I mean , what do you really know for sure ? What can you prove ? You see , we can 't prove anything . The world needs proof . Without it , all we have is crazy stories . Without proof , in time , even if it comes out what we 've seen here . I can 't live like that . I 'll be fine . I 'll be right behind you . No . Kate , wait . Kate ! [ radio chatter ] [ radio static ] [ Newscaster ] So we have no idea where this mystery island has appeared from , but it could actually just be a sort of cartographic error all the way back to the CIA . So that sort of raises all sorts of conspiracy- - Sweetheart , you 're awake . How are you feeling ? Mom , I- - I had a really bizarre dream . There was a treehouse and a girl and the--the crystals . Dad , the crystals . Take it easy , Lucas . You 've had quite an ordeal . We 'll be back soon , sweetie . We 're just going to go talk to the doctors , okay ? Nana Kathryn . What are you doing here ? I--I thought you were in that place . They said you were sick . Kate , I prefer Kate . Kathryn is so old fashioned . Kate ? I told you I 'd be right behind you . [ Man ] It is with great pleasure that I welcome to the stage this year 's recipient of the Nobel Prize for achievement in science , Dr. Kate Rose Thompson . [ applause ] Thank you . It 's been a dream of mine since I was very young to win this award . It 's a great honor , a great honor . My team and I have verified the discovery of a living Arthropleura and so many other creatures thought to be extinct . We 've done this through the successful extraction and analysis taken from the specimen so carefully preserved in my old blue field diary . [ laughter ] [ Man ] Dr. Thompson , how do you feel about the few critics out there who claim that this is merely a genus of giant centipede ? That , my dear , is not a centipede . It 's an Arthropleura . [ chirping ]

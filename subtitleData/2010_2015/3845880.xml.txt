 Why am I having these headaches ? When MacPherson was part of your consciousness ... he may have left something behind . Paris , 1899 . My daughter Christina had been murdered . H.G. Wells is to be fully reinstated as a Warehouse Agent . Thank you , sir . And no matter how much good she 's done for all of us , I 'll never trust that woman . Someone has found the lost Warehouse . It was always believed to be somewhere near Alexandria . Warehouse 2 is back online . So we need to find Warehouse 2 and shut it down . H.G. , guess who just saved the day . Myka . Myka . Myka . Myka , come on . Pete ? Come on , get up . We gotta go . Pete , where am I ? Egypt , Warehouse 2 , and we are in big trouble . Big bump . I know . I got one to match . What 's that sound ? That 's sand . No , I 'm sorry , scratch that . It 's the whole freakin Sahara desert . This place is filling up with sand , Myka . The way we came in is history . I don 't know , when H.G. bolted she must have triggered some kind of self-preservation thing , something that protects the artifacts . H.G. , she played us ! She played me ! Oh , big time . Oh , I 'll kill her . I 'm gonna kill her ! Myka . What ? I get the whole anger thing , but could you please just channel it into finding us a way outta here ? Okay , okay . Our Warehouse , right , there 's a back door in our Warehouse , so there must be one here too . Bingo ! Right . Pete , look , a hatch ! What ? Whoo-hoo ! Yeah ! Myka , you found a hatch . Yeah ! A hatch ! Whoo ! 100 feet up there , so not as good , but- - well , it wouldn 't be up there if there wasn 't a way to get to it . Right . Right ? So let 's look for something , you know . Egyptian endless wonder . Right . Get it . Yeah ! Okay , just keep searching the shelves , okay ? There 's gotta be- - there . I don 't know , like , a magic ladder , or--or a catapult or something . And go . It 's probably just a rug , Pete ! And move , and fly . Oh , my God . Pete , I 'm looking at the ten original books of Plato . Is there a chapter on flying ? Not that I remember . Oh , oh , oh . What about- - what about a snake around a staff ? Isn 't that a medical symbol ? Uh , that 's probably the rod of Asclepius . It 's probably some sort of healing device . Yes , we can definitely use this . Ah . Or not . Pardon me , sir . Pete ! Pete , over here ! Whoa . Right ? Okay , these wings were probably designed by Daedalus . He was the father of- - Icarus . Ha , even I know that one . Turn around . What , why me ? You 're the one that eats like a bird . Well , just don 't get us too close to the sun , okay ? They smell . Oh . Whoa . These things actually attract wind . Yeah , they generate their own lift . Holy crap ! Whoa . Can you imagine watching a Browns game like this ? Yeah , I bet that 's exactly what Daedalus had in mind . Up . Pete , up . Ah , the hatch ! Yeah . All right , get it , get it , get it , get it . Okay , stop , stop . You ready ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . Go ! It 's stuck . Well , yank it . Yank it hard . Really ? At a time like this ? I 'm sorry . Oh , what ? Come on ! Pete , do you hear that ? That 's the Farnsworth . It must be working again . We must be high enough . Back pocket . What ? Okay . Yeah . Ooh . Stop laughing ! Okay , okay . Okay . Okay . Artie . Hi . Myka , listen , H.G. Is a bad guy . We know ! Pete , good , you 're together . Yeah , we always kind of thought we 'd go out this way . Look , Artie , Valda 's dead . Warehouse 2 is filling with sand . Artie , listen , I 'm really sorry . Tell Kelly that I love her . Tell her to- - shh , shh , shh , shh . Close your eyes . Close your eyes ? That 's the last thing he 's gonna say to us ? I always thought it would be a little more , you know , meaningful . He didn 't even say good-bye . I know . Oh . Oh , Myka , hold on , hold on . Pete , close your eyes ! I can 't see . Okay . The wings of Daedalus . Good call . Don 't just flap there . Come on out . Here we come . Hold on . Whoo . Whoo , man , you have got to let me keep these . Oh , right , because they worked out so well for Icarus . Artie , who are you , Jerusalem Jones ? What ? I just bought this . So how 'd you find us ? I pinpointed the coordinates on your Farnsworth . Good thing it started working again . Yeah , they 're designed to work deep underground , but when I lost the signal I realized that H.G. Had jammed it . I knew you were in trouble . When I got here , I reset the frequency . It was a piece of cake . Finally , listen , H.G. ' S a bad guy . We know ! Judging from the depth of her preparation , it seems obvious to me that H.G. Wells has been planning this for a long- - and I mean a long--time . She hacked into the Warehouse account to fund those students . Yes , and she discovered , somehow , the location of Warehouse 2 even before she was bronzed . Did MacPherson know that somehow ? Yeah , but she needed experienced agents to get in there . Well , she obviously wanted an artifact , but which one ? The place is filled with sand , Artie . It 's gonna take months to dig out . Artie , is there- - is there some kind of inventory of Warehouse 2 ? Yes . For a time , I had a cognitive connection to Warehouse 2 . Much of its inventory was downloaded into my mind . Hell of a backup drive . Can you access it ? I can try . It 's fading . Tell me quickly what you remember of H.G. ' S last position . Well , Myka and I were in the office trying to figure out where the key went , right ? And then H.G. ran to see if she could turn off the orb . She went to the main floor . Can you describe the area in which she was ultimately found ? There was- - there was vases . There was lots of clay pots and vases . How can she spot what 's missing ? She 's just that good ? Yes . Now I assume that Warehouse 2 has an inventory system like ours . Each item is labeled with a hieroglyph of Anubis . If Anubis is sitting , then the item is in its proper place . If Anubis is running ... Ah . Rack of Spears . One is missing . Rack of Spears . Missing spear , labeled in any way ? Yes . Fading . I can 't tell you . The image is gone . Okay , no . Artie , this is progress , right ? We don 't know where she is , but- - Paris . I 'm still tracking H.G. ' S access to funds . She just bought a ticket from Cairo to de Gaulle . Why Paris ? When Pete and Myka were in 1961 , H.G. told me her daughter was murdered in Paris . Okay , so she 's returning to the scene of the crime . Or that 's where Christina is buried . Maybe the spear has resurrection properties . She wants to bring her daughter back from the dead ? I don 't know about Spears , but I can tell you resurrection is a dangerous practice and always comes at a price . Yeah , look at Mickey Rourke . So- - all right , Pete , Myka , you go to Paris . Claudia , you try to find out exactly where Christina 's buried . I will do research on Spears . Mrs. Frederic , you- - will just be Mrs. Frederic . Hey , it 's Kelly . You mind ? Sure , Pete , we 've got nothing but time . Kelly , hey . I was just gonna call you . What happened to you ? Two days ago we had a vague conversation about moving in together , and then- - then you disappear . Ugh , Kelly , I 'm- - look , I 'm so sorry . You know , you must think I 'm the biggest jerk in the world . Well , I went between that and wondering if I should be calling hospitals . No , no , no , no . I 'm fine , I 'm fine . It 's a long story . I had a sudden business trip . Pete ! Look , um , Kelly , we got a lot to talk about . Pete , you know , if you don 't want to see me anymore , it 's- - no , no , Kelly , look , I- - I love seeing you . Okay , you 're my happiest place on earth . You mean that ? I know it in my soul . Okay , I just--I 've got this one more trip , and then I 'm yours completely . The minute you get back . The second I get back . And , Kelly ... I love you . Okay , I said it . Yes , I even said it first . So go ahead , make fun . I 'm really glad you found someone , Pete . You deserve it . Okay , now I really feel like a girl . Well , hike up your skirt , 'cause we got a bad guy to catch . Boo-yah ! â  ª Warehouse 13 2x12 â  ª Reset Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Hang back there , Pointer Sister . Sorry , sorry . I thought , you know , handling some ancient Spears would trigger a notion , but- - okay , well , I 'm sorry to interrupt you while you 're handling your ancient spear , but I found Christina 's gravesite . Good . You let Pete and Myka know ? Texted them . They land at de Gaulle any minute . All right . Um , Artie , can I talk to you about something ? Will it make me feel old and uncomfortable ? Not this time . All right , go on . Okay , when Dr. Vanessa was here trying to save Mrs. Frederic , she , um ... She said something that kinda scared me . When it looked like Mrs. F. might not make it , she said that I should be ready . And you want to know , ready for what , Hmm ? Actually no . Uh , I 'm--I 'm pretty sure I 'm not ready . I know that I might talk big sometimes , Artie , but I can 't even buy a wine cooler in this state , so whatever you might have planned for me- - breathe , breathe , breathe , breathe , breathe . You can do whatever you want . You control your own destiny . But she said- - no , nothing has been decided or will be decided without your complete consent . You promise ? With all my heart . You will live the life that you want , and I 'll make sure of that . Oh , thank you . Voila , monsieur . According to Claudia , the Cimetiere du Rennes should be right around this corner . H.G. ' s probably already here . Good , first time , shame on her . Second time , I 'm bringing that bitch down . I love it when you talk dirty . What ? Where 's the cemetery ? It has to be here . This is the address . Excuse me . Hi , uh , excuse me . Uh , do you speak English ? We 're looking for " the cemetery du Ron . " Cimetiere du Rennes moved many years ago . To where ? Bah . Ew . What now ? Okay , look , if H.G. ' s plan was to resurrect her daughter , then she needed to arrange for the upkeep of her remains , right ? Which means there 's an estate . And estates have lawyers . French lawyer . Bah ! Bah . Mr. Sempe , thank you for taking this walk with me . If you want to visit Christina Wells ' resting place , I can give you the address . You don 't need me . Oh , but I do . I don 't want to go all around Paris shooting people . As my lawyer , you can give me full access . Full access ? I don 't understand . You don 't have to understand . You just need to sign whatever needs to be signed . Then what ? And then maybe I 'll let you live . You check the girl . I 'll look for the lawyer . It 's empty . He 's gone . She 's in shock . Look , if H.G. shot her with the same gun that she used on us ... Then she 's come and gone already . Pete . Look . I 'm grateful she 's been taken care of to my specifications . I signed the papers . You can do whatever you want in here . May I leave now ? In a moment . Don 't be rude . Remove your shoes and step into this , please . Madame , please , I 'm just a simple lawyer . Not even a very good one . Now would be nice . What is it ? Primordial tar from Pitch Lake in Trinidad . Don 't really have time to explain what it does . You wouldn 't believe me anyway . I 'm stuck . You have no idea . Help me ! Help me ! Help me . No ! If you put water in it , it turns it into a tar pit . Don 't fight it , dude . That 's what the Woolly Mammoths did . Pete , H.G. , she ran down there . Oh , mon dieu . What in the hell was that ? Monsieur Sempe , you mind waiting outside ? Happily . This place is a labyrinth . She 's gone . Pete , would you mind- - what ? You know , looking to see if Christina ... Ew . Yep , she 's dead . Still really dead . Okay . Pete . Yeah ? H.G. didn 't even have the spear with her . Yeah , but we don 't even know how it works . No , no , something- - something is wrong . She took something , something that 's missing . The handle . Are you sure there was a handle ? Yes , and then the other one 's right there . Show me . Okay , if you can 't see it , the ends have points , like--like arrows . I 've seen that shape before . Where ? I don 't know what it is , but I can 't get it out of my head . Look . MacPherson must have left an image of it inadvertently via the pearl . Okay , wait , wait , wait , wait . Let 's look at that shape from different angles . Now what did Myka say , that the tips have points or- - like arrows . Like arrows , all right . Like arrows . Now ... Does this suggest an- - Mrs. Frederic , do you see- - see what ? It 's not a spear . It 's ... The Minoan Trident . So a bad thing ? What 's the Minoan Trident ? A weapon of mass destruction . The first weapon of mass destruction . Okay , okay , wait . The Minoan Trident was the first weapon of mass destruction ? The trident was the first artifact locked away by Alexander the Great in what became Warehouse 1 . In the 15th Century B.C.E. , the Minoan civilization was destroyed by a catastrophic volcanic eruption . Oh , I know this one . It 's the Thera Volcano , which created the island of Santorini . The Thera eruption was thought to have been caused by a trident , which when jammed into the ground three times causes a fissure in the earth 's surface . If done in the right place , it could unleash a volcanic eruption . Is that what Plato based the story of Atlantis on ? Right , right . Poseidon had a trident . I played him in the fifth grade with a pitchfork and a toga . At out Ralph Brunskie for that part . Kid had a voice like Jennifer Tilly . I am Poseidon . I 'm--I 'm terribly sorry . Que sera . Peter ... The trident is real . That 's one of the reasons the Romans came to Egypt . Caesar wanted that power . That explains why the trident is in two pieces . H.G. found part of it in the 1800s and hid it on her daughter 's casket . And MacPherson debronzed her so he could find Warehouse 2 and the other half of the trident . That 's why she killed him . He was about to tell us . Yeah , the question is : Now that she 's got both parts , what is she planning to do with them ? Someone evil just bought a plane ticket . To ? Casper / Natrona International , Wyoming . That 's only two hours away from here . All right , get back here right now . MacPherson was collecting artifacts to sell them to the highest bidder . Do we think that H.G. is doing the same thing ? Let 's hope so . The alternative could be unpleasant . Good , boy . You did great , Harvey . There 's a lot less to lick now , but I promise you it 'll make your life a whole lot easier . When I saw this , I thought of you . Oh , Pete . Gorgeous . Oh . Look , Harvey . He even engraved it with our favorite breed . Let 's send him a picture of us using it . It looks like things are okay between me and Kelly . Why would you say that ? She sent me some pictures ... With her and a little puppy . Look , she 's powdering his nose . Look at the little puppy . Okay , it 's official . I 'm a girl . You had a lot of vibes about H.G. , didn 't you ? No , not really . God , you 're a terrible liar . What ? Look , I trust your instincts , Mykes . We 're partners , a team . Yeah , well , I put the team in danger because I thought I knew better than everybody else . Look , you need to forget about that . Okay , there 's no way that any of us could be sure that- - no , there was plenty of doubt from everyone but me . H.G. has a huge advantage , Myka . She 's willing to lie , steal , and kill to get what she wants , and we 're not . So I 'm gonna side with us on this one . With you . Lattimer . Oh , good , you 've landed . I do hate voicemail . Oh , hey , Lady Koo-Koo . We were just talking about you . Well , what , are you calling to play a little game of let 's make a deal ? Oh , I 'm afraid not , dear boy . Oh , come on . Nutjob like you must have quite a wish list . How ' bout a little electroshock therapy , zap the crazy right out of you ? Run a trace on Pete 's phone . Already happening . We put a trace on both your phones as soon as you got to Paris just in case . Once I lock in on her signal , I can track her with this . With what ? What is that ? Show me- - are you messing around with stuff in the Farnsworth aisle ? I 've been quite impressed , keeping up with me as you have . Not quite catching me of course , but then I am me . Well , go ahead , get nice and comfy . Oh , don 't worry . I 've closed all my accounts and buried my trail . So now are you just calling to brag or did you get a sudden craving to be bronzed again ? 'Cause we can make that happen for you . For such a mediocre kisser , I 'd have thought you 'd at least have brains . Yeah , well , you taste about as old as you are , so right back at you there , grandma . Now what do you want ? Just to suggest that you check in on Kelly about now . Pete , don 't- - listen , you leave her the hell alone . She has nothing to do with this . Oh , I haven 't done a thing . But you , you sent her a lovely gift . I 'm sure she 'll be crazy for it . We have to get to Kelly . No , no , no , no , she 's just trying to distract us . Artie , I can 't stay here , I gotta go . All right , just watch your back . Got her . Where is she ? Wyoming , and not far , but- - what ? She 's not stationary . She 's moving . Looks like I-26 , heading for Bryson Reservoir . Bryson , Bryson Reservoir . Bryson , Bryson , it 's in the middle of nowhere . I mean , it 's not even a tourist stop on the way to- - Yellowstone . She 's on a road trip to see America ? She can 't be . You don 't think that- - you don 't think what ? She can 't be what ? The Yellowstone caldera . Artie . I 've got a map here . Not this , this . A seismic hazard map of the six known supervolcanoes in the world , and the most powerful of which is thought to be Yellowstone caldera , which is under- - well , it 's under Wyoming , Idaho , and Montana . Are you kidding me ? People go there for vacation . If H.G. were to jam the trident into the ground there- - it would cause a chain reaction of monstrous proportions . Millions would die immediately , but there 's a far greater problem . Bigger than millions would die ? The last supervolcano that erupted was 75,000 years ago . Triggered an ice age . Only 6,000 humans survived . Claudia , go back up Pete . You and I are going to Yellowstone . She 's taking a car . We 'll take a chopper . We 'll get there ahead of her . Go , go , go . Right , hey . You know , this is kinda cool . Good luck . Yeah . Can we get there in time ? We have to . Kelly , are you here ? Kelly ? Kelly ? I 've been waiting for you . Oh , my God . You scared me to death . I thought- - hey , no , ha , hey ! Kelly , wait a minute ! Just hold on ! Just--just cut it out ! That is exactly what I intend to do , cut it out . Gotta be an artifact . Even I can 't make women this angry . Just stand still . Listen , Kelly , somebody did something to you , and I don 't know what , but just , please , you gotta trust me . I love you , Pete . Oh , babe . Babe , I love you too . And that 's why I have to kill you . Really ? Really ? No ! Give me that . Pete . What are you doing ? Kelly , are you back ? What 's going on ? Let go of me ! It must be the knife . What , she gave you Lorena Bobbitt 's knife ? I 'm so thirsty . Okay , come on , baby . Come on , come on . God , I need some water . Are you okay ? No , get me some water . All right , hold on , I 'll be right back . Ow . Oh , God . Are you putting me down ? Now we 'll do this the easy way . Artie , something 's fishy . Pete , won 't answer his phone . Don 't worry , Claudia has his back . She 's gotta be right around here . The magma chamber is highest here . Right here ? Yeah . Okay . What 's that for ? This is a subterranean heat sensor . Reaches thousands of feet into the ground and- - okay , wow , the temperature is astronomical here . If she 's coming , she 's coming here . And here she is . I 'm not surprised you found me . But I 'm quite baffled that you expect to do anything about it . And what could you possibly want that you would go to these lengths ? What , money ? Power ? What ? Nothing ! Nothing ? What do you mean nothing ? You obviously know what you 're holding . This isn 't a bargaining tool . I intend to use it right here , right now . Hiya , Kelly . What 's up ? Claudia , you can 't be here right now . I have work to do . Uh , Kelly , hey , hey . Hold on a second . What are you doing there ? Chopping Pete up into little bits . Uh-huh , right . And why ? Because I love him . And that 's a beautiful way to show it , but , um- - Claudia , if you don 't get out of my way , I 'm going to have to kill you . I 'd really rather you just give me the ax . All right then . There 's got to be something here . Did somebody send you that ax ? Let go of me ! What 's newere , Kel ? Compact ! Hello , antique-y . Where 'd you come from ? Pete sent it to me . Hang on a sec , Pete . Kinda got my hands full here . L--L.A.B. Laboratory ? No . Ah ! Initials . Okay , Lonny ? Lindsay ? Larry ? Lizzie ? Lizzie . Lizzie Borden ! Woot ! Lizzie Borden took an ax and gave her father 40 whacks . And when the job was neatly done , she gave her mother 41 . My God . What 's going on ? And why is Pete tied to my table ? Claudia , what 's happening ? It 's okay . Somebody , I can 't tell you who , gave you Lizzie Borden 's compact . Lizzie Andrew Borden . I did a term paper on her . Apparently you name your daughter Andrew , and she chops you into little bits . Big surprise . I tried to kill Pete . No , it 's--it 's okay . Why would I do that ? Well , looking into the compact probably makes you kill the thing you love . So maybe Lizzie did it after all . What are you talking about ? No , no , baby , baby . Baby , this is good , okay ? This means that you love me . Stop . See , ' cause the truth is- - stop ! I tried to kill you . Wait , Kelly . Hey , Kelly , Kelly , it 's all right . Just give it a rest for a bit . Give her head time to catch up . Wait , I don 't understand . Why would you kill millions of innocent people ? Innocent ? Open your eyes , Myka . Have you looked at the world in which you live ? So because you lost your daughter , because you 're angry- - no , don 't you dare . This may have begun with Christina 's murder , but it 's not about that . Yeah , I foolishly believed that if I could find a way to travel through time then things would have improved , a utopia would have emerged , but here we are over a century later and things have actually gotten worse . The divide between rich and poor , hunger and famine , war and violence and hatred , all flourishing beyond control . Indeed men have found new ways to kill each other that were inconceivable in my day even by fiction writers . But millions of us are struggling against that every day . This planet needs a rest from what you 've done to it . It needs a chance to repair itself . Oh , my God , you seriously intend to start another Ice Age . The only way to save this world is by destroying the parasites who are eating it alive . I don 't normally do this . And you 're gonna wish you hadn 't . Artie ? Oh ? Artie , what is it ? Artie , what is it ? The Corsican Vest ? I 'm afraid so . Artie , what 's- - what 's happening ? Well , the vest , it belonged to the Corsican Brothers . Twins . When one of them got hurt , the other felt it . You did that to yourself . Where did you find it , Venice ? Fort lauderdale . Oh , of course . Ahh ! Myka ! Three times . Don 't let her do it three times . I won 't . Hey ! I wouldn 't . Myka , talk to her . Talk to her . So what , the entire planet is subject to your judgment now ? What about the millions of mothers who are gonna lose their daughters just like you u lost Christina ? Is that right ? This is no world for a child . I don 't think you believe that . I do . Watch me . No ! Myka , that 's two . You are lying to yourself . You never wanted this . If you wanted to kill Pete and me , you would have done it at Warehouse 2 or in Paris . And Artie , you would have let him die in Russia , but you didn 't . I needed you to trust me . No , you needed us to stop you . You wanted us to follow you and stop you . That 's why you called Pete this morning . Think , Helena . You are so filled with grief and anger , but there is a part of you , I know it , there is some small part of your soul that knows that this is wrong , and--and that part is still alive , and it 's just pushing to get through . Yes . That 's the part that refuses to kill the very people who can stop you . No ! Stay away from me . All right . If I am wrong , then kill me . Do it ! Kill me now . I mean , we 're all gonna die anyway , right ? So what 's the difference ? So shoot me . Shoot me now . Kill me . But not like that . Not like a coward . I want you to look me in the eyes and take my life . Come on . Do it . Do it ! So if you 're not gonna put H.G. Wells back in the bronze sector , where 's she gonna go , some other weird place that we don 't know about ? The less you know , the better you 'll be able to do your job . That doesn 't sound good . You both did excellent work retrieving that artifact and preventing a worldwide disaster . That , of course , is the prime directive of Warehouse agents . H.G. Wells was a formidable opponent . She fooled us all . She didn 't fool Artie . Fortunately , I 'm still a lousy shot with a real gun . Are you gonna die on us every year ? 'Cause it 's getting kinda boring . I 'm gonna keep dying until it takes , or not . Ah , it hurts when I shrug . Yeah , well , I bet wagging your finger at me , old man , will be- - hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , kiddo . Hey . I plan on making your life hell for a very long time . Can I hug you ? Maybe later in the week . Okay . Hey . What are you , uh , putting together some stuff for a shelter ? I 'm leaving . Okay , okay , look . I 'm sorry . I 've been really busy at work , but I found some bones in the garbage today and they 're very- - I know , I know , I know . I--I 've been wanting to tell you , but ... Okay , I don 't really work at an I.R.S. Warehouse . No kidding . All right , just- - just listen , okay ? The rule is I can tell one person , one really important person , so- - no , don 't . I am not the one , Pete . So please don 't tell me . I don 't want a complicated life . Complic- - it 's not that complicated . Kelly , it 's way more simple than it looks . Okay , Lizzie borden 's compact makes you kill the one you love , like she killed her dad . You love me , and I love you . It 's simple . It 's just that your life is filled with excitement , and danger , and just insanity , and it 's--it 's all the things that I don 't want . There are quiet days too . Good-bye , Pete . Stay safe . Hey . What 's up ? I 've been , um ... Trying to figure out ways to simplify my life , and it all boils down to three words . " Quit your job , Pete . " Four words . Mm-hmm . I wasn 't counting " pete . " So then what ? I don 't know , get Kelly back . I don 't know , try and live a normal life . What ? If you had wanted to do that , you would have already left . Look , just because that worked on H.G. Doesn 't- - this--this is the right life for you . It is . You were born for it . And you 're really , really , really good at it . You are . You need this Warehouse , and this- - Warehouse 13 needs you . You can 't quit . Yeah . Yeah . All right , I 'm gonna go see Artie . You coming ? Um , Pete , I- - in a bit . Okay . Okay . I understand you wanted to see me . Yeah . Yes . Would you- - would you give this to Artie , please ? Myka . You can 't blame yourself . It could have happened to any one of us . But it didn 't . It happened to me . You talked her down . You saved us all . It should never have come to that . I put the entire world in Jeopardy . I can 't even conceive of that . I just know that I can 't- - I can 't take that chance again . And neither can you . â  ª â  ª " Artie , it breaks my heart to write this . " We both know the Warehouse is my happiest place . " I 've thought a lot about this , " and I can 't stay here . " If I do , I 'll second-guess myself " into oblivion . " Please forgive me , but I have to go . â  ª â  ª " Pete , you 're the Big Brother I never had . " I wish I had your strength . " I know I frown at you and punch you a lot , " but I 'll always love you . " Please be careful . " Leena , you 're the only mom they have . " Watch over them , " and make sure that Artie eats right . " Claudia , take care of Pete and Artie . " Let 's face it , " you 're the only real adult in the group . " I wish I could be there to see you grow into " the amazing woman you 're gonna become . I love you all , Myka . " â  ª â  ª

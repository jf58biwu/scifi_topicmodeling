Oh , we 're still makin ' tater salad , though , right ? Yes . All right , I guess we can push dinner to 3 : 30 . What 's at 3 : 30 ? Dinner . Brian 's coming to our race ! Wait a minute . What about my pie ? This is Pie Day pie . If we don 't eat it at 3 : 14 , it 's ruined . Bring it to the race ! It 'll be victory pie . No , it 's Pie Day pie . 3.14 ! You know what ? Yeah , sure . Why don 't we go ahead and eat dessert before dinner ? You know ' cause it 's Opposite Day anyway , right ? It isn 't . Thanks for not reminding me . Yeah , so I gotta go put this bird in the oven . I 'll see you guys at the race . Not looking forward to it . Thanks for nothing . You 're terrible . Oh , I got one . Hello , Brian , I love you ! You just complimented him . I know . Oh , wait ! I mean , I don 't know . I mean yes . Brian , I hate you . I didn 't mean it . I mean , I did . Brian , don 't go away ! I mean , don 't come back ! Brian ! Help me , Ki . I won 't . Kerry , stop playing baby 's first extortion . Name a real price . Three hundred ? You said 200 ten seconds ago ! Kerry , baby , why you gotta play your fourth cousin like that ? Yes , I know that the evidence would exonerate The Law . I 'm the one on video framing him . Yeah , I know I was sloppy . 250 ? Just bring the drive to the usual place , I 'll hand you a sack of coolies . Oh , yeah , no problem . He 's right here . Let me talk to him . Hello . No ! God ! My , my , my , looks like someone is getting a lump of coal in their Leetmus turkey this year . Ok , guys . Here 's how this is going to shake out . Giggles , you 're up first . I 'm gonna wrap my powerful thighs around your neck and squeeze . Won 't be giggling ' then , will ya ? I don 't giggle . I don 't giggle , right ? No , guys , just beat him up . No ! No ! No ! Aloha human students . I am a female teen from VGHS . Is there a human story here ? It 's a girl ! She 's gonna tell the other girls ! We 're not gonna get any kisses ? Ahhh ! Um , This is ... this isn 't over . Greetings . Do you require assistance ? Leave me alone , you stupid girl . I don 't need anything from anybody . I 'm The Law . I 'm prettier than even you ! Brian , hold up ! 20 apples bobbed . Yeah , in your face , Duchess ! How 's the achievement hunt going ? Terrible ! Duchess is creaming me , and I lost my dance partner . Apparently , I 'm " too intense . " Speaking of which ... Jenny , no . No . No ! I gotta get this bird in the ... Brian ! What time 's the dance ? Two o 'clock . Wear black and satin spats . Fix your hair . Pick up the phone much ? Jeez . Look , Calhoun , it 's my day off , alright ? Spare me your sob story . I 've got your Leetmus bonus . I get a bonus ? Yeah , bonus hours , which you work now . Mandatory , so get your ass to the noob nog booth . You know , Calhoun , I 've been reading up on some child labor laws , I don 't think that ... Do I smell an unauthorized turkey being cooked on school grounds ? Grinch . Freeloader . You 're a girl . You 're not supposed to be in here . That 's too bad . I like being here with you ! Golly , you 're shaking . Allow me . Woah , heat functionality . Killer ShotBot costume . Are you gonna enter this in the Halloween costume contest , er ... ? No . Tell me about what went down in that alleyway . Oh , it 's quite a story all right . It 's a story of an FPS wunderkind framed for a crime he didn 't commit by a sniveling RTS carpetbagger . It 's a story of a school that turned their backs on me when the chips were down . And once I get my hand on that evidence , it 's going to be the story of my redemption . Redemption , eh ? That sounds like a story that the real ShotBot would be interested in . Need a partner ? Partner ? Fat chance , doll face . The Law rides alone . I see . That sounds very lonely . Why do you wanna help me anyway ? Because you 're not the only one looking for a second chance . Name 's Law . Barbara . Rebecca Barbara . Well , Rebecca Barbara , let 's go clear my name . Put Shane behind bars . Maybe make out and touch a bunch afterwards . Who knows ? Let 's see where the wind blows . The wind is currently blowing south by southwest at a speed of 1.2 knots . Amazing . Let 's go ! Strong girl . And we 're back , resident hearthrob , Games Dean , here live at the noob nog booth . Eh ! Get back to work , Brian . Sorry , guys . Extra whip on me . Whew ! Hey , Games , I gotta pee . Can you cover me ? You got five minutes until commercial break . Awesome , man . Thanks . I 'll be right back . I promise . You are out of your minds if you think I 'm gonna scoop that . According to those nerds that I just pumped for info , Shane will be meeting his cousin at about four o 'clock . What you got ? Well , according to this interview , Shane enjoys chillaxing with a cucumber scrub by his usual place the drinking fountain . Perhaps this is the usual place he spoke of on the phone . Great work , babe . All right , here 's the plan . I 'm gonna blast 400 reps on this thing , and then I 'm gonna go meet Shane and squeeze him up . That will not work . You are flabby and sad . Shane will beat you up . Flabby and sad ? I 'll show you . You know what ? I knew having a partner was a bad idea . Just get lost ! Shane has big muscles and a black belt , but his cousin Kerry has an IT degree and kankles . The Law I know plays it smart beats up on the little guy . Damn , you do get me . Hey , Becs , about that whole " get lost " thing , that 's water under the bridge , right ? Water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen . God , you 're so smart . Let 's go . Wow , that was incredible . I know , right ? Hey , can you bring cider tonight ? Yeah . Yeah , more things in your face , Duchess ! Oh , crap ! Dean 's gonna kill me ! Games , I 'm sorry . Yeah , thanks for lunch , Brian . I 've got an egg race to cover . Brian ! Where have you stayed ? The race is not gonna start in a year now . I 'm kinda screwed here , Ki . Can you just tell Ted I 'm sorry ? He 's gonna be so happy . I don 't have an idea . I won 't be right back . What ? All right , extra , extra whip on me , okay ? Easy . Well , they were out of decaf , so I got ya some green tea . Has the perp shown up yet ? No . Well , it looks like you and me are in for a stake out , Beccy-Babs . So , Law , once you 've obtained your freedom , what 's your next move ? Well , once that happens , I 'll probably become rich and famous again . Speaking of which , when that happens , don 't expect me to like care about you or buy you crap . I don 't need crap . I just want to help . For real ? Girl , you are weird . I dig weird . My other school said I was so weird that our ratings plunged and they were going to deactivate me . So stupid ! You 're school sounds like my dad , and I hate your school . Your school doesn 't know what he 's talking about . Your school should have left mom a long time ago ! You 're amazing , Rebecca . No one 's ever left me that comment before . Excuse me . My eyes are malfunctioning . Yeah , uh , I got somethin ' in mine , too . Dust or somethin ' . Look ! There he is ! It 's Kerry ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Hey , do you know what station the egg race is on ? Brian ! I stole the finish line . Now , you can still see Ted win . Please tell me it 's still Opposite Day . Oh , no , it 's almost 3 : 15 . He 's never gonna make it . Happy Pie Day , Brian . Ted , eat this in the next ten seconds . You got it , Kiwi . It 's coming out of your pay . Sup idiot ! Woah ! You got a pretty neck , Kerry . Think I might have to squeeze it if you don 't gimme what 's on that drive . Sorry I 'm late , Kerry . I just ... Law ! What are you doing here ? Hey Shane . Nothin' What are we gonna do with you ? Don 't hurt him , Shane . Wait , why is ShotBot still here ? It 's not ShotBot , you idiot . It 's my smokin ' hot girlfriend . Girlfriend ? Girlfriend ? No , no , no ! No , I mean , you know that 's ShotBot , right ? I mean , you do . You just have to . I mean look . No , no , that 's impossible ! No , I don 't accept this . I mean , that is so a robot . You met him ... on PwnZwn . Wow . I just ... I can 't ... you guys ? You guys just take him away . You ! You used me for a story . I trusted you ! Law , I can explain . I don 't want to hear it . Guys , let 's go . I hate you ShotBot ! I hate you ! Yeah , Duchess thought she had it in the bag , and then bam ! I turned on the blood elevator , and the spookiest gingerbread house goes to ... Jenny Matrix ! Um , I 'm guessing you forgot the cider ? If by forgot cider , you mean ruled Leetmus Day like a yuletide goddess , then , yes , I forgot the cider . Sorry about that . No . No . You know what ? It 's fine because we don 't need cider . We don 't need pie . We don 't need ... where 's Ted ? Right here , dude . Dude , you 're eating a burger ? I thought you were going to shower ? I did , but then one thing led to another ... Anyway , let 's chow . Dude , where 's the potato salad ? Sorry , dude , no salad , but you know what ? At least we 're all here together , right ? Yeah , I guess . You know what , let 's just enjoy this perfect turkey . Merry Leetmas , guys . Come on . Salt . There 's no salt . I forgot the salt . I 'm sure it 's fine , Brian . A low sodium diet is a good thing . Instead of salt we could use ... You know what , Ki , just stop , okay ? There 's salt in Brian . Brian has salt . That 's just how it works , okay ? The end . Oh , do you want some of my burger ? No , Ted . I don 't want any of your burger . I asked for one thing . To cook you guys dinner . That 's it . Is that too much ? But no , instead it 's " come to my race , Brian , " " dance with me , Brian , " " let 's have dessert before dinner , Brian . " And I asked for what ? What ? Cider ? Pie ? Not to destroy my booth ? ! Which I have to pay for , by the way . I can 't afford tuition . I can 't be seen with my girlfriend . Brian ! And I don 't ask for crap from any of you . Wait , you two are dating ? Why didn 't you tell me ? Wow , Ted , be more needy . Make this more about you . You are the most selfish ... Okay , Brian . No . No . I 'm out of here . Forget it . Enjoy your burger . Sorry I 'm late . I brought yams . You 'll be hearing from my lawyer . So , is he serious about that ? 'Cause I 'd be in a lot of trouble . Everybody ! Merry Leetmas ! May I have your attention please . The RTS team is proud to present for your dunking pleasure the one , the only , The Law ! Boo ! That 's right . Take on The Law in the one game he can 't cheat his way out of . One good throw is all that stands between this scumbag and two hundred gallons of ice cold water . So show him how you feel , VGHS ! Yeah ! Was this your master plan , Shane ? Get my underpants soggy ? Oh Law . My master plan is real estate Barbados . This is just funny . Isn 't it ironic ? Their misplaced hatred of you based on a lie is going to destroy the only evidence of the truth . It 's ironic , right ? I don 't know . I just kind of throw that word around . Heyo ! It 's Reggie . He 's my broker . I just made 100 grand . We 're gonna get oysters . Me and Reg , but have fun here . Down with The Law ! Shotty ! Great news ! PwnZwn wants you back . You going undercover as a student went megaviral . I got my job back ? But I failed . I didn 't get my human story . Who cares ? You 're a hit . Scott , when those guards were sent to deactivate me , you fought for me . Is that because you care about me ? Yeah , you big green goof ! Now , get in ! Wait a sec . I kind of live in here . I know . I 'm cleaning it up , all right ? Yeah , good job . So pretty epic blow up back there . Yup . I 'm a jerk . I get it . Look , kid , first , get up 'cause you 're lying in egg nog . Second , you 're not a jerk . Believe me . My kid 's a jerk . Like hardcore . You just snapped . Listen , take tomorrow off . Well , I mean , finish cleaning this up . Consider that even for the yams . I really scewed up , didn 't I ? I don 't think I can fix this . You made a mistake . You 're a good kid . Now , stop q-quing about it and go apologize . Brian ! I mean , clean this up , Brian ! You 're being lazy ! Merry Leetmas , Calhoun . Go to hell , Brian . Hey guys . About before , I 'm sorry . It 's ok . No , it 's not . I need to be able to open up to you . I just hate feeling like a burden . We brought mops ! And more pie . We 're gonna help you clean . Ok , Brian , you start by eating that pie and Jenny and I will tackle the nog . Ted , dismantle the booth ? Ted ... Hey , we 're cool . Yeah . How about I get you some soda to wash down that pie . All right . Thanks buddy . Amazing grace , how sweet my quads . Law , hang on . I 'm coming . How do I get you out of here ? You can 't help . We both know these pythons won 't hold . I 'm sorry I lied . If you knew I was a robot , you 'd never like me . ShotBot , that 's ridiculous . I didn 't like you for your smokin ' looks . I liked you ' cause you 're rad . Now , get out of here with those bedroom eyes . I can 't stand you to see me like this . Not until I finish my story . Here 's the first draft . Bot meets boy . What are you doing ? Bot falls for boy . You idiot ! The water will kill you ! Bot hurts boy . What are you doing ? ! Stop ! And now I 'm sorry , Law , but boy loses bot . Don 't do it ! No ! Law . No . Goodnight , sweet bot . This robot was the greatest journalist the world has ever known . Who among you will honor him ? I will . My man . My . My god . The Law didn 't cheat after all . He was framed ! By who ? I don 't know . Those files got wet .

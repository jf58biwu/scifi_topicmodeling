 Previously on Warehouse 13 . Hello . I have a special ... Order . Do you have a date ? No . Be yourself . So , what high school did you go to ? Why all the questions about my past ? What am I doing here ? What kind of advice is , " Be yourself " ? Because myself is a giant freakazoid . When you said , " Meet me at the diner , " I thought you 'd arranged some lame meet with me and Todd . Todd . Hey . Hey . Get out . Yeah , leaving . My lips can 't focus . I 'm too excited . Me , too . I know the Warehouse is finally getting a computer upgrade . Right . The IRS warehouse where you work . Exciting . Very exciting . I know , right ? That place has been running on a first-gen eight-bit GUI since like the Stone Ages . Oh , I 'm so sorry . I keep forgetting you 're not a high tech kind of guy . Hey , I 'm pumped if you 're pumped , but my computer skills go as far as getting new ringtones for my cell phone . You 're cute for a luddite . Oh ! Yikes , I 'm late . We have this guy coming to install the new system . Some mucky-muck from some place called Global Dynamics . Catch up later ? I could bring lunch . Crustless PB and J , Twinkies and Doritos ? And an orange for fiber . Mmm , that 's why I loves me some Todd . What ... What ... What are you doing ? Do you have any idea what you 're doing ? Look , I was asked to upgrade this place to class seven standards and I can 't do that with you constantly interrupting me . Adapt . This is not Eureka . I will not have you gutting my system . Your guts are rotted . All right , every single wire has to go exactly back where it was . Half of these aren 't even wires . This one looks like shoelace . All right , let me be perfectly clear . There 's no metal . Just ask the lady that asked me to come and ask her what she wants me to do . Heyo ! If you damage any of my data , you will not come within an inch of a computer for the rest of your life . Artie , Artie , Artie , Artie . Artie , why don 't we let our special guest , who I bet Mrs. Frederic wouldn 't have sent here if he was trouble , do his thing , huh ? Come on , buddy . He 's a Global Dynamic geek . I know . He 's soulless . He 's made up of binary numbers . Yeah . I 'll tear his heart out if I need to . Hello ? Wire in the hole ? I drop stuff down there all the time . Hold onto me , will you ? I 'm Claudia . Resident tech girl . Douglas . Douglas Fargo . Everyone just calls me Fargo . Okay , Doug . Neat gizmo , huh ? Yeah . What makes it glow ? Is it like a phosphorous compound ? No . It belonged to Ben Franklin , amplifies human energy to ... First time in the Warehouse ? Until the scary lady with the beehive showed up , I kind of thought Warehouse 13 was just an internet rumor . So , any chance after I 'm done with the install , I could get a tour ? Ooh , no can do , outlander . You 've only got blue level clearance . I have to ask , is this gasp ? Better than gasp . This is going to replace all of that . It 's from Global Dynamics , where I work . Well , run , I guess . I 'm in charge . What about this thing ? It 's a MARA . A Maintenance and Repair Automaton . It 's for use in unmanned space stations , large facilities . I actually invented it . But I was going to install it with your system , but your boss vetoed it . Yeah , Artie would have vetoed fire if he 'd been born just a couple years earlier . So you ready to fire up Warehouse 13.1 or what ? Let 's get this over with . Okay . Shutting down the old systems now . And bring in the new . Anybody going to ask me to dance ? What exactly did you do ? The new OS should have come right on . Oh , really ? I hope that means we can 't park here . Catastrophic failure detected . Catastrophic is a bad word . Those eyes are popping up all over the Warehouse . Is this thing looking at me ? And what are they doing ? I think they 're watching us . This is all your fault , Bismarck . Fargo . And it is not my fault . When we shut down the old system , some sort of failsafe activated . I 'm completely locked out . You didn 't think to mention there was a failsafe ? I didn 't know there was a failsafe . And aren 't so-called computer experts supposed to realize that before you shut down a system ? Okay , boys , take it outside . Let me work a little Claudiaosity . I never should have let you in here . Well , it wasn 't exactly your decision now , was it ? Hey . Oh , no , you didn 't . That 's not coming from this office . All systems functioning within acceptable parameters . That voice . I recognize that voice . That 's Hugo Miller 's voice . Who ? He was the original designer of the Warehouse systems . Where are you going ? Um , the computer lab . You have a computer lab ? More like a computer morgue . You didn 't think to mention there was a computer lab ? Well , later on , I 'll make a list for you of all the things that I didn 't think to mention . Has this been running the entire time ? No , of course not . The place has been shut down for 35 years . So why is it ... You know what ? Spread out , don 't touch anything but look for an off switch . Who was Hugo Miller ? Brilliant man and more than a little devious . He actually encouraged Bill Gates to go in one direction while pushing Steve Jobs to go in another . Hey . Hey . Hugo spent years down here integrating the whole Warehouse into a workable platform . Looks like he spent a lot of time playing with himself , too . No way . Awesome ! Lemon-lime ! Pete , that 's been here for years . If I were you , I 'd put that down . Hugo was a huge practical joker . He 'd leave exploding cans of pop everywhere . Used to drive everybody nuts . Artie , what happened to him ? He retired . Hello , blinky . Bet that 's the failsafe . There must be a main power junction . Are you all right ? I 've been hit with worse . You sure ? This thing is tied into the failsafe . Whoa , take a gander . It 's uploading a massive amount of data from our mainframe . Whatever it is , I think it 's moving in . This failsafe is hardwired into the whole system , into the temperature regulators , the security feeds , into the neutralizer pump . Maybe that 's okay . We were installing a new computer anyway . Well , one we can control . Why don 't we just bring Hugo Miller here ? I told you , he 's retired . Retired ? Or ... No , he 's alive . Don 't be dramatic . There were rumors of a nervous breakdown , but ... Well , sitting in a windowless room for 10 years playing Monopoly with Hal ? What could go wrong ? Do we know where he retired to ? Place called Hutchinson , it 's in Featherhead . Featherhead , that 's two hours away . We should at least go talk to him . It 's worth a try . Yeah , I think I could " retire " here . Well , let 's check you in then . Hugo doesn 't get many visitors . Just give me a moment . I wonder if they give sponge baths here . Do you know every former Warehouse agent we 've ever known is either crazy , evil or dead ? Or all three . You can come in now . Mr. Miller , we 're from the ... I know who you are . You 're President Ulysses S. Grant and the snowman . You 've come because it 's Arbor Day , and there aren 't enough zippers to go around . Well , at least he 's not evil or dead . Yet . Hugo ? We have some questions about something you built years ago , a backup computer system . It went round and round , spinning and spinning and dancing and flying . This is not going to be a standard interview . No , no , it 's not . The koala bear is actually a marsupial . " All systems functioning within acceptable parameters . " Hmm . " Recovery failsafe is active . " Yes , Hugo , exactly . Exactly . The failsafe . How do we shut it off ? You don 't have the code . Agent Miller , President Grant is ordering you to give us the code . Of course , Mr. President , but I must be paid in bicycles . Can do . Mmm-hmm . I 'm not paying a bicycle for that . You know , maybe we should just take him back to the Warehouse . Warehouse 13 ? Yeah . Yeah . You remember Warehouse 13 ? The spinning and the dancing , and ... And the boxes . If he sees the Warehouse , he may remember the code . What do you think about that , buddy ? Huh ? Can we get ice cream ? Yeah . If that 's what you want . Yeah . Definitely . Okay . Ice cream . Whoa , whoa , whoa , Hugo . Hey ! No ! We got everything on Hugo Miller . Excellent . Is it hard to find ? Yes and no . Perfect . All we have to do is go through ... All of it 's redacted . Who would do that ? The Regents . Crossing things out . Wait , wait , wait , wait , they found Hugo collapsed on aisle Allentown-22C . Cited it as mental exhaustion . Um , guys , it 's finishing . Please don 't blow up . Oh , that wasn 't so bad . No , no , no , we 're still locked out . Is that ... Hugo . It 's Agent Miller . Agent Nielsen , I am Hugo One . I assume control in the event of catastrophic failure . Holographic artificial intelligence . Must be one of the earliest models ever . That would explain the Tom Selleck mustache . We were just installing a new system . There is no catastrophic failure . I will be the judge of that . The judge ? My eyes are currently scanning the Warehouse for irregularities . I must also review decades of artifact retrieval and personnel files . Excuse me . At least he 's polite . Artie , look , we found Miller , okay ? But he 's a complete nut job . He kept talking about spinning and dancing . He Tesla 'ed us , Artie . Well , his program is some kind of artificial intelligence . Bring him back here so he can turn this thing off . Yeah , he kind of slipped away from us , so we 'll call you back when we get him . This is very unusual . He 's normally quite docile . We checked . He 's not on hospital grounds . Here are his records you asked for . Thank you . You know , Myka . Yeah . This guy couldn 't have spun or danced far . Spinning and dancing , right . On the way here , we saw ... I think I might know where he is . What ? What ? What ? What did we saw ? Hugo , are you okay ? So sad . It worked last time . Hey , Hugo , hey , buddy , I 'm going to put these bright shiny bracelets on you , okay ? And you can tell us all about it on the way to the Warehouse . Yeah ? Come on up . Yeah , let 's do this one first . Hugo , we really need your help . Can 't help without the spinning . So why would he model Hugo One after himself ? Lots of programmers do that . I mean , I never have . But some others do . But this is impossible . When this was developed , A.I. Was just science fiction . If something seems impossible , it usually means there 's an artifact involved . He 's coming back . I have completed my analysis . And everything 's cool , right ? So you can skedaddle . Claudia Donovan , your file shows nine separate incident reports . I actually thought it would be more . I guess he 's got your number . Douglas Fargo , your Global Dynamics profile includes the phrase " inappropriately pushed button 38 times . " Wait , wait , wait , you can access my G. D. File ? No , no , he 's accessing the Warehouse system . If I can view an ATM in Sweden , for example , then so can Hugo One . Agent Nielsen , your unconventional management skills are subpar . Okay , I 've have had just about enough of you . I have determined the source of the recent catastrophic event . Which is ? The agents who work here . I have completed my analysis . - Todd ? - Hey ! Where are you ? Your Doritos are getting cold . Shoot . Ah , I 'm sorry . This is ... Got a bit of an emergency here , I 'm going to have to reschedule lunch . Oh , okay . No problem . Maybe dinner ? God , I hope so . - Who 's that ? - Nobody . I 'm nobody ? No , you 're Todd . This is Todd . I can 't talk right now . Who is that ? Nobody . I 'm nobody ? No . Uh , I can 't do this . I 'm going to have to call you ... External communications are for Warehouse business use only . Maybe a bad idea anyway . So who 's Todd ? A guy . A friend . A guy friend . It 's not serious . Why ? Yeah , no particular reason . I just got the impression that ... Just call her when your voice has changed . We have work to do . Hugo One , I think that your calculations are incorrect . The agents are not the problem here . Falcon Scott Protocol initiated . No , no , no . You can 't be serious . Protecting the Warehouse is my primary function . No . No . What 's Falcon Scott Protocol ? Well , the system initiates a temperature drop to subzero to protect the artifacts . And what happens to us ? Ooh ! Oh , that was fast . Anything useful in that file about our Lawrence Welk back there ? It 's weird . There 's a recent neuroimaging of his brain and it shows that there 's a whole section of it that 's completely dormant . And there 's no explanation why . I need to shed a tear . Don 't we all ? I think he means he needs to go to the bathroom . What ? Yeah . My uncle used to say that . Hugo , okay , you hold it . Okay ? I just got this baby detailed . There 's a gas station down the road . Jeez , it 's cold in here . You think by saying that every three minutes , it 's going to get any warmer ? We 've got about an hour left before it becomes life threatening . Then where are you taking us ? We gotta ... I didn 't catch that . What the hell is ... Whoa ! You took off his cuffs ? He likes to sit . That 's not in my job description . Ice cream . Not now , Hugo . That 's what it was like in the bathroom . Fine , you know what ? Grab me some Twizzlers . I 'm going to call Artie and see what 's up . Artie , I can 't understand you . Albert grows things . Huh ? Yeah , he 's had a long day . Just keep the change and thank you . Artie , slow down . Well , there 's a new one . I think the Farnsworth is broken . Babble , babble , babble . Okay . Artie , I don 't know if you can hear me but I went through Hugo 's medical file and half of his brain is burned out . " Bring Hugo back . Computer has taken over ... " What ? Mmm . Okay , we have to get back there now . All right , buddy , we 're going for a ride . I 'm going to have a little chat with Hugo One . Lattimer and Bering ? That 's what I thought . Hands above your head . Hey , pal , you 're making a mistake . Don 't push me , cowboy ! Or we could just raise up our hands . Yeah . Don 't you have any artifacts that make it warmer ? Increases elasticity , makes pigeons dance . Nothing here . I don 't get it . How is any of this dangerous ? Oh , trust me , if it 's been snagged , bagged and tagged , it 's got an evil streak . So , Todd , is he your boyfriend ? Guy friend . Okay . Boyfriend . He 's nice . What about you ? Girlfriend ? Used to . She doesn 't exist anymore . Oh . When you break up , you really break up . I 'm new to the whole dating meme . I mean , I like Todd , but he thinks I work in a tax warehouse , so it 's not like I could say , " Hey , sorry , I can 't make our date , " an evil computer took over my workplace . " Be nice if I could just have someone in my life I could be honest with , like you . Yeah . Nice . Oh ! Ooh ! Hey . A Zoetrope . I used to have one of these when I was a kid . Yeah , that would probably make ... Fargo , no ! I think I just saw your whole life flash before my eyes . And ? Was that a genie costume ? No . " Max Wertheimer 's Zoetrope . " Allows for mind transference . " Get out ! Wertheimer . Wertheimer . He was the Gestalt guy in the ' 20s . He pioneered the study of the brain 's thought processes . I spent some time in a psych unit ... Research facility . Hey , wait a second , Myka said Hugo kept talking about spinning and dancing . Unauthorized removal of artifact . Security measures engaged . Those are my MARAs . Hugo One 's been playing with your toys . But they 're just for maintenance and repair though , right ? Mostly . Whoa ! Nice ! Run ! Don 't move . Cops are on the way . Okay , look , Leo , I think you 're kind of stepping in it here , bro , I mean , the thing is , we 're kind of in a hurry . Yeah , no kidding , pretty boy . I saw you on the APB . You 're wanted for kidnapping , probably that guy , right ? The A.I. It must 've accessed the internet through the Warehouse . You think it doesn 't want us to bring Hugo back ? Look , Leo , you 're making a huge mistake because we 're Secret Service . Look , I 'm just going to reach for my badge slowly and I 'm going to throw it over to you and just take a look at it . This looks real . That 's because it is real , Leo . But the Secret Service protects the President . Yeah , and the President 's nowhere else around here ! Not as stupid as you thought , huh ? Hey , hey , hey . What ? Soda pop goes boom ! Pete , are you okay ? What 's he talking about ? I don 't know . Blast off with lemon launch . Remember ? Huh ? Hugo makes his own lemony launches . " Houston , we have a problem . " What 's wrong with him ? Do not get me started . Hugo , doesn 't Leo look thirsty ? What a lark . Look out ! That 's it ? What the hell ? Billy Jack ! What did you think was going to happen with a can of soda pop ? The guy built a computer that can have us arrested . I thought his practical jokes would do more than make the floor sticky . Sticky ! You wanted to chat ? God , I hate that . I intercepted Donovan and Fargo attempting to remove an artifact from Allentown-22C . But you didn 't hurt them , right ? The dropping temperatures will soon preclude any further breeches of protocol . Bully for you . Very happy for you . Listen , Hugo One , I was thinking , you know , while we 're waiting for me to take the big sleep , that you and I , I don 't know , we could pass the time , maybe by playing a game . Attempting to distract me with games is futile . I know . I know . I know . But come on , Hugo . Come on . You can 't resist playing a game , any game , I know you can 't . Does that work ? No ! Stupid MARAs . We can 't stay in here forever . We can stay in here until that thing wakes up . Out , out , out . We got to go . Was that the original ... Don 't say its name ! Trust me on this . It could get ugly . All right , come on , we 're the two biggest techno brains in the Dakotas and we 're totally getting our asses kicked by Colossus . That ring you have , can it amplify anything other than human energy ? Like for instance ? For instance , a laser . Marry me ! D-9 . Miss . D-10 . Hit . Ah ! You sunk my battleship . Sorry . A-7 . Miss , again . If this works , we 'll probably only have a few seconds before it drains the cutter 's charge . Hey , if we die , it 's been fun . Agreed . Awesome . Fargo , watch out . It is my destiny ! Twenty years of practicing in front of a mirror for the best four seconds of my life . We rule ! I like Todd . I had a completely different thought . No , I mean ... I 'm really sorry . I like you , Fargo . I do . But when we kissed , I was totally thinking of Todd . I really like him . He 's not just some guy . He 's the guy I think about when I impulsively kiss guys I 've just met . We 're still cool , right ? Yeah , totally . Good . Let 's find this Zoetrope and get it to Artie . This is why Jedi turn to the dark side . Come on , Hugo . Okay . Artie 's here . Yes , yes , he is . He 's here . Come on . Let 's go see Artie . What 's wrong ? It won 't open . Tick tock , change the lock . Oh , man . I knew this was going to happen someday . The computers have taken over . Step one , kill Pete and Myka . Step two , unleash the nuclear arsenal and then bam ! Pretty soon , we 're all in human breeding camps wearing fur bikinis . You know what ? Sometimes I think your brain is the artifact . It 's just ... It 's just a program , Pete . Computers can 't think for themselves , all right ? Mine does . Okay . E-3 . Hit . You 've won , which is impossible . Well , not when you 've played the way I have . See , I never put any of my battleships on the board . You cheated . You know what I think ? I don 't think that you 're artificial intelligence . You 're Hugo Miller . Part of him , anyway . Pete and Myka have the other part , don 't they ? You ... You don 't know anything about me . Well , I think I know more about you than you do yourself . I know that you loved wearing those hideous leisure suits , and I know you had a fat orange cat , and I know that you always cheated at games . It used to drive everybody completely crazy . And for some reason , the part of you that loves games is still in there , and the part of you that cheated is not . Hugo , what the hell happened ? Full programming was discontinued by the Regents , deemed too dangerous . But the potential for human-computer interface is invaluable to the scientific community . And so you took a shortcut . You cheated , you used an artifact . I may have miscalculated . Instead of copying my electroencephalographic waves , it transferred them . Half of Hugo 's brain didn 't burn out . It 's in the computers . Well , the left side anyway . The compassion and intuition and improvisation , that 's still in Hugo 's body . Hugo , you can 't run the Warehouse with half a brain . I mean , look , I was able to trick you at a child 's board game . Let Pete and Myka come back to the Warehouse with the real Hugo . Let us try to put your brain back together . Oh , man , I 'm really starting to hate these things . Well , hello . No , no , Hugo . No , no , no . That 's a bad sound . Pete , I really think that we should just ... Take cover ! Take cover ! Hugo , get down ! Get down ! Get down ! Artie ? Artie , we got it . Max Wertheimer 's Zoetrope ! Hugo Miller could 've used this to copy his brain into Hugo One . That 's why he was able to create such a sophisticated A.I. 25 years ago . Except that he 's not an A. I. And it 's not a copy . It 's really half of Hugo Miller 's brain in there , which is why he can 't function as a full human being . Right , Hugo ? Your argument has merit . The right side of my brain should be reconnected with the left , but not in human form , inside the computer . You 'll be trapped in there . The human body fails after a few years . Computers are forever . He has a point . If I help you then what do I get ? I shall lift the restrictions and abort Falcon Scott Protocol . Lattimer and Bering may return to the Warehouse with Miller and complete the transference . If you do this , you know you 'll be killing the real Hugo Miller . No . The real Hugo Miller will become his life 's work . Okay , Hugo , that thing 's firing freaking laser beams at us , man . We have to get past that eye . Where is the Tesla ? Oh , it 's in the car . I 'll get it . Careful . Be careful . Okay . Okay , but it 's not fully charged . All right , well , it 's our only shot . Well , I 'm a better shot , so I should take it . Bull . Okay . It 's gone . Hugo ? Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Hugo , you go first . Pete ! What ? Just ... All right , I 'll go . Artie , you can 't do this . I know . It 's just Hugo One has left us no option . So what ? This lamp thing is going to suck out the rest of this poor guy 's brain ? Yes . The Warehouse comes first . We all knew that going in . Hello , there . Wait , that 's ... Hugo . What ? I 'll explain later . Shall we begin ? No . No . Artie , we 're not going to feed a former agent to some pissed off Atari . No , no , Pete . What the hell are these things going to do ? What the hell are those things going to do ? Nets ? Fire ? I don 't know . Or spinning blades . No , no , no . No , no . It 's okay , guys . I got it . It 's okay . Just stay back there and don 't make it angry . Hugo ? That is not necessary . We will do exactly as we 've agreed . Thank you . Until the procedure is complete , all systems will remain on automatic . You will continue to be locked out of any access . Guys ? Could you please hurry because I already shaved once today . Please connect the Zoetrope to the failsafe . Claudia . Sorry . The spinning . Begin . Artie , you can 't . You have to stop this . There 's a person in there . All right , now . Now , what ? The lights have dimmed . Yeah , and ? That 's exactly what happened when Hugo One first ... Was first turned on . ... turned on . So now we 've got a shot because ... Because the transfer might be taking up most of his processing power . Yes . We might be able to get back into the system . Exactly . You can remotely access the Warehouse through your laptop ? I hacked in from Switzerland once . Sweet . Guys , we 're losing him . There 's a pass code . Crack it . It 's six digits or letters . I 'm counting on your hackery . I need more than eight seconds . Ah ! Myka , the picture ! He gave us this code when we visited him . It 's a picture of a cat . Wait , he had a fat orange cat . What was the name of the cat ? Fatty catty ! Orangy ? Try Orangy . No go . Orangy . Really ? Albert . Albert . It 's Albert . How do you know that ? Because we went into that store and he got ... Hugo said , " Albert grows things . " The name of his cat is Albert . I 'm in . Yes ! Yes ! All right . Lock him out of everything , but this lab . Illegal access . Disengage . Oh , boo-hoo . Time to set things right . What are you all doing in my office ? Hugo , you don 't remember ? Remember what ? I was in the middle of a procedure and I ... Oh . Oh , what the hell is this ? What ? What ? Hugo , buddy , we got a little story to tell you . Let 's go get some ice cream . I can 't . I 'm lactose intolerant . Ooh . What ? Do you ever think about our future here ? Like how do we not end up with our brains scrambled or blown up or whatever new way to die there could be ? Well , I mean , look at the bright side , I 'm usually within 10 feet of you so whatever terrible thing happens to you will probably happen to me , too . Comforting . You know , when we play rock , paper , scissors , you don 't always have to pick rock . I don 't always pick rock . Yes , you do . All right , next time I will pick scissors . See , you shouldn 't have told me that . And that should do it . All the most recent patches and upgrades . I cannot wait to see all the technical achievements I 've missed . Did Billy Gates ever get that project of his off the ground ? Um , in a way . Yeah . You 'll love Eureka , we have a brain mapping project so up your alley , it has a parking space . Yeah . If things don 't work out in Eureka , please consider coming back to be with us . Thanks , but I really couldn 't leave Eureka ... Not you . I 'm so glad you 're back . Thank you , Agent Nielsen . Oh , just call me Artie . Artie . Artie ? Wait , Artie ? We used to play Battleship together . You hated computers . Still do . Maybe there is no such thing as evolution . You and me and MacPherson , we have to get together . Well , that would be nice . But there aren 't as many of us from the old days as there used to be . Ah . Hugo . Artie . Good luck . Forget it . Hey . Hey . Thank you for coming . I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry we got cut off earlier . Something huge came up . It 's okay . Listen , there 's something I need to tell you . Me , too . Look , I 'm sorry I 've been such a flake lately and my head 's been in a weird place , but I recently got some clarity ... I don 't think it 's a good idea for me to see you anymore . I 'm sorry .

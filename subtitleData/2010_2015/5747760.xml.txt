 Previously on " the 100 " ... - Mom ? - You 're being sent to the ground . Abby : All 100 of you . Prisoners of the ark , you have one job--stay alive . To do that , you must locate mount weather immediately . Man : Nothing we 've tried will save the ark . Have you tried not saving it ? Man : We 've really gotta do this- - Bring the ark to the ground . [ gunshot ] You started a war that you don 't know how to end . You have no idea what your people have done . I had to stop the attack . The mountain men , they 'll come And they will kill us all . [ gunshot ] Second man : Murphy shot her . Get her into the dropship . We need to leave . There 's an army of grounders Coming for us right now . If we stay here , we will die tonight , So pack your things . Just take what you can carry . Now . [ raven screaming ] That 'll stop the external bleeding . I don 't understand . How did murphy get a gun ? Long story . If murphy hit the fuel tank instead of me , We 'd all be dead . Wait , there 's rocket fuel down there ? Enough to build a bomb ? Enough to build 100 bombs ... If we had any gunpowder left . Let 's get back to the reapers . Bellamy : The enemy of my enemy is my friend , right ? Not this enemy . We saw them . Trust me , It 's not an option . There 's no time for this . Can she walk or not ? No . We have to carry her . The hell you will . I 'm good to go . Hey , listen to me . That bullet is still inside you . If by some miracle , there 's no internal bleeding , It might hold until we get somewhere safe . But you are not walking there . Is that clear ? I 'll get the stretcher . Can 't run away fast enough , huh ? Dying in a fight you can 't win Isn 't brave , bellamy , it 's stupid . Spoken like every coward Who 's ever run from a fight . Clarke : All right , that 's enough . It 's time to go . If they follow ? It 's a 120-mile walk to the ocean . Look , we 're wasting time . If he wants to stay , he can stay . No , he can 't . We can 't do this without you , bellamy . What do you want me to say , clarke ? I want you to say that you 're with us . Those kids out there , they listen to you . They 're lining up to go . They listen to you more . I gave them an easy choice . But 5 minutes ago , they were willing to Fight and die for you . You inspire them . I 'm afraid we 're gonna need that again Before this day is through . Man : Gunners . [ music playing ] You did good here , bellamy . 18 dead . 82 alive . You did good . [ sizzling ] Miller : You know the first thing I 'm gonna do When we get to the beach ? Jasper : No . What ? I want to go surfing . Quiet . Keep your eyes open . No more woods . A view of the ocean . No more damn trees , just pale , blue water . What is it ? Why are we stopping ? I don 't know . Jasper : I don 't see anything . [ people gasping ] [ indistinct shouting ] Grounders ! [ indistinct shouting ] bellamy : Move , move , move ! Jasper : I don 't see anyone ! Octavia : They 're right behind us ! Go , go , go ! Finn : Shut the gate ! Shut the gate ! [ indistinct ] Where are they ? Why aren 't they attacking ? Because we 're doing exactly what they Wanted us to do . What are you talking about ? Lincoln said the scouts would be the first to arrive . If it 's just scouts , we can fight our way out . That 's what lincoln would do . We 're done doing what that grounder would do . We tried it and now drew is dead . You want to be next ? That grounder saved our lives . I agree with octavia . For all we know , there 's one scout out there . One scout with insanely good aim . Clarke , we can still do this . Looking to you , princess . What 's it gonna be ? Run and get picked off out in the open , Or stand and fight back ? Clarke . If we 're still here when tristan gets here- - Lincoln said " scouts . " more than one . He said , " get home before the scouts arrive . " Finn , they 're already here . Looks like you 've got your fight . Ok , then . This is what we 've been preparing for . Kill them before they kill us . Gunners , to your posts . Bellamy : Use the tunnels to get in and out . From now on , the gate stays closed . Whoa , whoa , whoa . You 're not a gunner . No , I 'm not . Like you said ... I 'm a grounder . Bellamy : All right , let 's get to those foxholes . So , how the hell do we do this ? We 've got 25 rifles with 20 rounds each , give or take . Roughly 500 rounds of ammo . While you two were gone , we made some improvements . Thanks to raven , the gully is mined . Partially mined . Thanks to murphy . Still , it 's the main route in . If the grounders use it , we 'll know . She also built grenades . It 's not many . Again , thank you , murphy . We 'll make them count . If the grounders make it through the front gate , Guns and grenades should force them back . And then ? Raven : Then we close the door and pray . And pray what ? That the ship keeps them out ? Because it won 't . Then let 's not let them get through the gate . All foxholes , listen up . Keep your eyes and ears open . Inflict casualties , as many as possible . You can hold them off long enough to make them turn back . That 's always your plan , just like the bomb at the bridge . Damn right . You got a better idea ? It can 't be that simple . You said there 's fuel in those rockets , right ? Enough to build 100 bombs . I also said we 've got no gunpowder left . I don 't want to build a bomb . I want to blast off . Draw them in close . Fire the rockets . A ring of fire . Barbecued grounders . I like it . Will it work ? The wiring 's a mess down there , but yeah . You give me enough time , I 'll cook them real good . Sinclair : Here 's how we bring the ark to the ground . Stage one : Separation from go-sci . Series of explosions sever the ring That we 're now standing in from the rest of the ark . Now , once we have separation , all port thrusters will fire And our orbit will begin to degrade . Stage 2 : Reentry . Reentry will be violent and it will be very , very hot . Friction will break the ark back into its original stations . Some of the stations- - And we can 't predict which- - Will explode . [ indistinct chatter ] And some of us will be on those stations . Sinclair : Which brings us to stage 3--landing . All starboard thrusters on the surviving stations will fire . Acting as landing rockets , They will slow the impact even further . Now , our target speed for impact with the ground Is 70 miles per hour . In all my simulations , anything above that is not survivable . [ indistinct chatter ] No one said that this will be easy , ladies and gentlemen . Just that if we don 't try it ... We all die . So , how close are we gonna land to the kids ? As close as we can . Finn , do you see it over there ? Finn : No . Raven , we can 't find the ignition system . Raven ? I can 't feel my legs . Ok , hold on . We 're coming . Ok , let me see . [ groaning ] That bad , huh ? [ groaning ] Oh , raven . The bullet 's in your spine . You 're bleeding internally . We better do this fast then , huh ? Get back down there . What if we can slow the bleeding ? Would that help ? Well , of course it would help . Can you tell me how to do that ? That stuff the grounders had- - coagulant . You said that lincoln had some , too . Yeah , it 's in the box with the antidote , but I- - I 'm betting that there 's more of it in his cave . - If I can get there- - - wait a second . No . I can make it . Clarke , tell him he 's being an idiot . Raven . What ? I 'm not gonna let you die to save me . Fine . If you won 't let me save you , How about we save everybody else ? You 're the only one who can fire those rockets . If you die , we all die . I 'll be right back . Finn , wait . Wait . Clarke , I need to do this . I can 't lose you again . You won 't . Man on p.A. : Mecha station , good to go . Orchid station , good to go . Flint station , good to go . Woman on p.A. : Hydro station is good to go . Man on p.A. : Aero station , good to go . Chancellor jaha , all stations are prepared for launch . In peace ... May you leave this shore . In love ... May you find the next . Safe passage on your travels . Until our final journey to the ground ... May we meet again . All : May we meet again . All : May we meet again . All : May we meet again . Jaha : Sinclair . Yes , sir . Take us home . Taking us home , sir . Initiate go-sci separation ... In 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 . Separate . [ indistinct chatter ] Sir , remote detonations failed . We are negative for go-sci separation , Negative for launch . Can you fix it ? Not from here , sir , no . Someone will have to launch manually . What are you doing ? Someone has to stay behind , abby . There has to be another way . I can go back and reprogram the system , We 'll miss the window for the eastern United States . We won 't land anywhere near the hundred . Then we 'll wait till it comes back around again . The ark will be out of air by then . Salvation ... Comes at a price . How much air will he have ? A week . Two weeks at most . We 're away . We 've launched . How ? Jaha : Godspeed , my friends . Godspeed . Thelonious , where are you ? Jaha : Right where I 'm supposed to be . Hold on tight , abby . You 'll see your daughter soon . [ beeping ] [ sigh ] And I 'll see my son . [ sigh ] [ drums ] Woman : They 're here . She left 5 minutes ago . Didn 't say where to . She thinks she 's a damn samurai . Monroe : No . What the hell are they waiting for ? The longer they wait , the better . This is about buying time for raven . Sterling over radio : I see them . They 're moving ! I count two , 3 , no , wait , there 's more . I don 't know , man . There 's too many of them . [ gunfire ] - Who was that ? - Sterling , I think . South foxhole . South foxhole , report now . Sterling over radio : Yeah , yeah . We 're ok . They didn 't attack . It 's like- - It 's like shooting at ghosts . There ! I see them ! [ gunfire ] Stop ! Stop . Hold your fire ! Hold your fire ! Reload . Now . Those were our last clips . We should--we should fall back . No . If this position falls , They 'll walk right to the front door . Man on radio : I don 't see anyone . Second man on radio : I hit--I hit them . I think I hit them . Do you see it or don 't you ? No . It 's a mess down here . It 'll be orange . Look harder ! You have to find the wire That connects the manual override To the electromagnet . It 's not rocket science . It is rocket science , actually . Guess we finally found something you 're not good at . I used to be picked first for everything . Earth skills , zero-g mech course . First ... Every time . So , how the hell did I end up here ? Raven ? I 'd pick you first . Of course you would . I 'm awesome . Hey , I found it . Orange wire . About time ! Now follow that wire To the override panel . Raven ? It 's fried . Totally useless . Tell me this isn 't as bad as I think . You know how to splice a wire ? - No . - Then it 's worse . Hey , stop . Just talk me through it . Jasper over radio : They 're everywhere ! Harper , get down ! We need backup ! Aah ! Raven , our mines actually worked ! Jasper can splice . Jasper , we need you in the dropship right now . Negative . We can 't give up the west woods . The west woods are mine , bellamy . The grounders just figured that out . Jasper , get in here . Harper : I see one ! There ! There ! They 're drawing our fire . Damn it . I 'm all out . They want us to run out of ammo . All gunners , listen up . The grounders are not attacking . They 're making us waste bullets . Don 't shoot when they 're running laterally . Jasper 's right . Don 't fire Until you 're sure it 's attack . Repeat , do not fire until you are sure . West foxhole pulling back . - Uhh ! - Aah ! - Uhh ! - Uhh ! That 's for not telling us about the minefield . Aah ! Uhh ! What do we do now ? [ murphy crying ] Now we attack . [ gunfire ] man : Aah ! Man on radio : They 're everywhere ! Fall back ! Fall back ! Man : Aah ! Here they come ! Man : The grounders ! Get back here ! [ growling ] Man : Bellamy ! Aah ! [ grunting ] Admit it . You want one . - Uhh ! - No ! You 're hit ! Miller , fall back , now . Can you walk ? Oh . Hey . Hold on to me . Let me get you behind that wall . Lincoln . You 're alive . I told you to leave . We tried . The scouts were already there . Bellamy on radio : I 'm out of ammo ! - What is that ? - Requesting backup , now ! Sterling . Sterling , do you copy ? Why are you not there ? We need medicine to slow the bleeding . You came to save one life ? I don 't have time to explain . Do you have the medicine or not ? I have it . Bellamy on radio : I see them . I saw--no , stand your gr- - If they take the gate , we 're all dead . I 'm going with you . Let 's go . Wait ! The enemy of my enemy is my friend . Finn , let 's move ! How far did the reapers chase you ? They 'd still be chasing me if I didn 't lose them . Why ? I have a really bad idea . Clarke : Hey , raven , tell us again How this is gonna work . Told you 5 times . Current flows to the electromagnet . That opens the poppet valve . Rockets fire . Ok . Got the good wire ready to graft on . What 's next ? Raven ? Raven ! Man on radio : I don 't see anyone . - Is she ... - Not yet . Man on radio : They 've broken through ! There 's hundreds of them ! They 're heading for the gate ! Game over , man ! Finish it . Current to magnet to valve to barbecue . Current to magnet to valve to barbecue . [ indistinct shouting ] There are too many ! Everybody to dropship now ! No ! We need more time . Gunners , stay at your posts . The rest of you , inside . Come on , move . [ indistinct shouting ] [ explosion ] Is that from the ark ? That is the ark . I 'm coming , clarke . Reinforcements . When they get here , They won 't find anyone alive . Take down the gate ! [ indistinct shouting ] Reapers ! What did you do ? I kicked the hornet 's nest . You brought the reapers ? I just bought us some time . How 's raven ? She 's not good . And the rockets aren 't ready yet . Jasper 's working on them now . Jasper ? What 's plan b ? Jasper was plan b . [ indistinct shouting ] Octavia : What the hell is that ? Bellamy : I don 't know , but they 're distracted . Let 's move . We 'll never make it . Leave me . I 'll find another way . I 'm not going anywhere without you . Octavia . Lincoln ? You did this ? Lincoln : With finn . It 's deep . I can help you , but you have to come with me now . Go . Let him help you . No way . I have to see this through . You can 't walk and I can 't get you Back to the dropship . He 's right . This fight is over for you . O , o , listen to me . I told you my life ended the day you were born . The truth is ... It didn 't start until then . Go with him . I need you to live . Besides ... I got this . I love you , big brother . May we meet again . May we meet again . Keep her safe . Now to the wall ! [ indistinct shouting ] [ whinnies ] Clarke , they 're taking down the gate . Good . Because I did it ... I think . I 'm closing that door . Wait ! We 've still got people out there . Bellamy 's not back yet . Man : Use the grenades ! All right , jasper , get everybody , get inside now ! There he is ! He 's never gonna make it . Bellamy , run ! Uhh ! He 's killing him . Give me that . Uhh ! Stop , finn , no ! Oh ! No ! Clarke , you can 't save everybody . Let 's go ! Let 's go . [ tristan roaring ] [ indistinct shouting ] [ shouting indistinctly ] [ groaning ] [ indistinct shouting ] Jasper , now . [ indistinct shouting ] Anya , you can 't win . [ indistinct shouting ] [ shouting indistinctly ] Man : Kill her ! Stop ! She 's already down . Raven says current flows to the magnet . We just need a current . Man : No ! Stop ! We 're not like that . Get back . Get back . She deserves to die . No ! We are not grounders . [ indistinct shouting ] Jasper : Let this work . Jaha : This is earth monitoring station , Earth monitoring station hailing all ark survivors . Please come in . [ static ] Earth monitoring station . Earth monitoring station , hailing all ark survivors . Please come in . [ static ] [ indistinct voice ] Hello ? Is someone there ? [ indistinct voice ] Keep talking so I can lock you in . Abby : Mecha station is on the ground . Repeat . Mecha station is on the ground . [ sigh ] abby , It 's so good to hear your voice . Yours , too . We made it , thelonious . Any word from any of the other stations yet ? No . Just you so far . Can you see any sign of them ? Going outside now . Stand by . [ music playing ] Tell me what it 's like . It ... Everything I dreamed . So much green . There are trees everywhere . And water . And the air . The air ... Smells ... Sweet . It 's so beautiful . Thelonious , you should be here . Abby , look . There 's smoke in the distance . That might be another station . We 'll check it out . Find the rest of our people , abby . Find clarke . This will have to do . May we meet again . What the hell ? Mountain men . [ coughing ] [ coughing ] [ clatter ] Monty ?

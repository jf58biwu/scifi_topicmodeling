 NARRATOR : Previously on Fringe : - Walter . - I lost the people I loved most and I imagine you miss them too , the people you 've left behind . Yes , I do . I will help you get home . LINCOLN : You okay ? - Yeah , I started to get another migraine . I was hoping I wouldn 't need these anymore . MAN : She 's not gonna remember the last two hours . When she wakes up , she 's gonna have one hell of a headache . I have come to tell you something , Olivia . Who the hell are you ? How did you know my name ? I have looked at all possible futures and in every one , the result is the same : You have to die . OLIVIA : That 's him . BROYLES : Are you sure ? They all look like the same man . OLIVIA : No , that 's the one . We 've been looking at these people for three years . Why did he make contact now ? I don 't know . But he knew my name , he knew who I was and he knew where to find me . And then he just vanished . What exactly did he say ? He said that he had seen all possible futures and in every one , I had to die . I had Astrid run a sample of his blood . There was no match on the DNA but she did find antibodies for the Spanish flu . The Spanish flu ? Isn 't that extinct ? The last recorded epidemic was in 1919 . Which makes him a minimum of 91 years old . I 'm going to assign you a security detail . - I don 't think that that 's necessary . - He threatened you . I 'm not sure that 's what he was doing . I think that he was trying to warn me . If he approaches you again , I expect you to notify me . Of course . [ PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY ] [ HIGH-PITCHED HUMMING ] Excuse me . WOMAN : Do you know her ? MAN : No . Oh , God . Is that supposed to be you ? She 's a teenager , isn 't that what they do ? Play depressing music and think about how everything sucks try and make everyone else as miserable as they are . It 's a stage . - Stage or not , that 's creepy . WORKMAN : Whoa , look out ! Get those people back ! [ WOMAN SCREAMING ] In my timeline , I could interact with the machine but since I 'm not supposed to exist here , it wouldn 't respond to me . We 'll require a biomechanical interface for the machine . Calibrate it specifically to your DNA so you can operate it . You 've done it before , Walter . You can do it again . OLIVIA : Good morning . WALTER : Hello , Olivia . We 're discussing cis-acting meiotic double-strand break hot spots . Don 't worry , I have no idea what he 's talking about either . What he 's talking about is trying to get me back home . I heard that Walter 's going to help you . I had to see with my own eyes . Don 't worry , Agent Dunham . This won 't interfere with my usual work . I assure you , if you need me , I will give you my full attention . It 's okay . I 'm just happy that you two are working together . I can 't say you 're gonna get his full attention . He 's a little wired up . Already electrocuted himself three times . Which reminds me . I can 't feel my urine response yet . I should probably go empty my bladder again . [ PHONE RINGING ] - Dunham . LINCOLN : Hey . This is a weird one . It seems a crane operator lost control of an I beam which was then tragically introduced to a Robert Englehart . - And ? - A few moments before he was killed someone handed Mr. Englehart a sketch depicting him being skewered by that same I beam , as if his death was predicted . You still there ? Okay , so the person who gave him the sketch what did he look like ? Was he bald ? - No , it was a she . A teenage girl . A co-worker was with him . She thinks she could ID the girl if she saw her again . We need to collect all the surveillance from the area . I 'm already on it . WOMAN : There you are . - Where have you been all afternoon ? - Just around . WOMAN : You 're supposed to call when you 're gone this long . - Sorry . - I met that kid in 3-C today . MAN : Hey , guys . - Dad 's home . WOMAN : Perfect timing . Dinner 's almost ready . Hey , buddy . Hi . WOMAN : So how 'd it go today ? Well ... Mwah ... . The interview was great . I start tomorrow . WOMAN : That 's great . [ HIGH-PITCHED HUMMING ] [ CHUCKLES ] Looks like the view from the lake house . You miss it , don 't you ? Dad , aren 't you tired of moving us all around so much , because of me ? It doesn 't matter where we are . All that matters is we 're together . Why did God make me like this ? You know how I feel , Em . God has a purpose for all of us , even if we can 't understand it . But I do know mine is to take care of you guys . Hey , at least it hasn 't happened in a while . Let 's , uh , keep these curtains closed at night , okay ? All right . You get some sleep . I 'll see you in the morning . I love you , Dad . I love you too , angel . BROYLES : Any luck ? Agent Dunham . Were you able to ID the girl ? Not yet . Lincoln 's with the witness at the moment looking at footage from traffic and surveillance cameras in the area . What ? I got a call from Health Services . You 've been three times in the last month ? - You checking up on me ? - I 'm your commanding officer . They tell me these things . Migraines . I needed a prescription , which is why I went to Health Services . Headaches , that 's all . Do you believe in fate , sir ? No , I don 't . Neither did I. This drawing ... How is it the day after a complete stranger tells me I 'm going to die I end up investigating a case where the victim 's death is predicted ? I mean , maybe that man from the opera house , maybe he does know something . Just for the next few days maybe we should be vigilant keep you out of harm 's way . Good news . Robert Englehart 's coworker just ID 'd the teenage girl from surveillance tapes . Got a good image from the bank across the street . - Do we know where she went ? - We know where she didn 't go . Surveillance showed her bypass the A Street bus . She also walked right by the subway entrance . So there 's a good chance she lives in the area . Maybe she goes to school nearby . [ HIGH-PITCHED HUMMING ] Stop the bus . I tried . Wait , six-eighths is the same as three-quarters ? Right . Keep dividing your fractions in half till you can 't without changing the denominator . No offense , Mom , but I understand this way better when Emily explains it . [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] Uh , good , morning , sir . Ma 'am . Sorry to bother you . I 'm Agent Olivia Dunham , this is Lincoln Lee , we work for the FBI . - What can I do for you ? - We 're looking for this girl . We 've been asking people if they know her . One of your neighbors said she might live in the building . No , I don 't think so . What 's her name ? We don 't know . Mind if I ask who else lives here with you , Mr ? Mallum . Jim Mallum . Just my wife , Diane , and our son . Danny , come here . You see this girl around ? Wait , is she the one we see at the park ? - I think so . JIM : Yeah , that 's Tanner Park . About four blocks over . You might wanna try that area . - Thank you . You 've been very helpful . - I wish I could offer more . - Did you happen to notice the cabinet ? - No . Why ? Red backpack . Same one she 's wearing in the picture . So why did he lie to us ? Soon as we get back to HQ , I 'll get the paperwork started on a warrant . Maybe we won 't have to . Uh , hi . I 'm Olivia Dunham and this is Lincoln . We both work for the FBI . It 's okay , you 're not in any trouble . We just wanna talk . Did you draw this ? Is he dead ? Yes . But I think you already knew that . How ? How were you able to draw this before the accident ? I don 't know . I just see it . In my head . Whenever I 'm around someone who 's gonna ... - I just sense it . - Just sense what ? Death . That drawing did you see something else that 's gonna happen ? - Maybe we can stop it . JIM : Emily . - Get in the house . - Mr. Mallum ... You can 't question her without parental consent . LINCOLN : You lied to us . OLIVIA : We don 't need your consent . It 's up to Emily whether or not she wants to talk to us . Emily do you wanna continue to answer these agents ' questions ? No . There 's your answer . Come on , Em . Let 's go . Let me ask you something . Do you think you 're the first people to come after my daughter ? It always starts this way . Authorities show up when they get wind of a girl with her ability . Then others come who wanna study her . Like those people at Massive Dynamic . Massive Dynamic ? JIM : And they never stop . No matter where we go , they find her . Watching from their cars , waiting for the right moment to grab her . Take her to their labs . They poke and prod her like she 's some kind of animal . You have any idea what that does to a young girl ? Please , let my daughter have a chance at what 's left of a normal childhood . My number 's on the card if you change your mind and wanna talk . Or if you and your family are being harassed I think I can help . When we get back to the office , run a background check on the Mallums . See what we can find out . I 'm gonna pay a visit to someone . Listen , you did the right thing out there . If it 's happening again , no one can know . It puts us all at risk . Dad , I saw something else . On the bus . Something awful . JIM : I 'm sorry , sweetie , but you know how this works . Even if you told them , would it make a difference ? Remember what they did to you when we tried to help before ? Trust me , okay ? It 's better this way . NINA : Of course . I 'd certainly like to see the results for that . Sooner rather than later . Yeah , well , send them to me directly . If I 'd known you were coming I would 've cancelled my lunch . - Hi . - Hi . Uh , I 'm actually here about Emily Mallum . Her father says that Massive Dynamic has been harassing her and her family . Are you asking me a question , or are you accusing me of something ? I thought you said that you were done using children as test subjects ? Yes , we are . Massive Dynamic did approach the family when they lived in Baltimore . Emily exhibited some fascinating precog abilities that would 've allow us to make drastic advances in our study of the human brain . We wanted to catalogue her abilities . Her father wasn 't interested , even when we offered to pay for Emily 's schooling . I don 't know how you could have raised me for so many years seen all the damage that was done to me , and pretend there 's nothing wrong with what you just said . - I am sorry . You know , what happened to you was awful . But this girl is different . No one made her this way . I don 't see the difference . I mean , it 's still abuse . [ PHONE RINGING ] - Dunham . EMILY : It 's Emily . You said you wanted to help , Agent Dunham . Can you meet me ? Can you hold on one moment ? I 'm sorry , I have to go . OLIVIA : Emily ? You picked a nice spot for us to meet . EMILY : It reminds me of a place we used to live . A better time . I sometimes sneak out here to think . To clear my head . Does your father know that you called me ? So , what did you wanna tell me , Emily ? EMILY : I think a lot of people are gonna die . EMILY : It started when I was 11 . I was in a pet store with my mother . We were looking at puppies when suddenly I heard this hum . I thought something was wrong with my ears . Like , you know how sometimes after you 've flown on an airplane ? But then , when we were leaving , the man behind the counter had a heart attack . I saw it in my mind before it happened . That was the first time . How long before it happened again ? EMILY : A few months . I heard the hum during class and an image popped into my head . My teacher lying dead in the street , covered in broken glass . Three days later she got hit by a car . My parents took me to a doctor , but ... And then people started to do tests on me . - And my friends heard about it . - And that 's when people got scared ? And then you moved ? EMILY : The first time . But it kept happening . Hmm . Fascinating . The theta-one waves in your occipital lobe are remarkably active . And also , your brain seems to be drawing elevated levels of both oxygen and blood . Meaning what , Walter ? Belly and I always had a theory that some traumatic events echo backward in time . Put simply , some future events ripple backwards . Well , not in a way that we 're consciously aware of , but sort of like vibrations . And perhaps your brain is uniquely sensitive to these vibrations . So it 's possible that 's the hum that you hear . Have you ever been able to control this ability ? EMILY : That 's not how it works . These images I see , they 're like dreams . At first , they 're vivid , but then they fade . That 's why I draw them . But it wouldn 't matter anyway . Whatever I see somehow it always happens . I know all these people are gonna die , but there 's nothing I can do to stop it . PETER : I don 't understand , Emily . Why do you warn them if they can 't do anything about it ? I don 't know . I guess if people knew maybe they could say " I love you " to someone . Orjust do one good thing . Maybe we can ID this man . She said she saw him on the bus . We can check the MBTA database . If he has a bus pass , they might have his photo . I haven 't thanked you for calling me . That must have been hard . Can I ask you a question ? Are you sensing anything now ? Like , here with me ? [ HIGH-PITCHED HUMMING ] JIM : Emily . - Dad ? - We called him . We didn 't want your parents to worry when you didn 't come home . - Did they hurt you ? OLIVIA : Mr. Mallum you don 't need to worry about us . Even if we 've never been able to stop it , let them at least try . We got something . Astrid found him . She 's got an address . According to his bus pass , his name is Albert Duncan . - He 's got an apartment in Jamaica Plain . - Let 's go . Then what ? Even if you save Mr. Duncan , what about the people in that drawing ? I don 't know . We 're not gonna help anything by standing here . Thank you . Can my daughter and I please go home ? There 's nothing more she can do for you . No , I think actually there is . I think you can hypnotize Emily to recover her vision of the event in that drawing . What makes you think I can do that ? Because where I 'm from , I 've seen you do it before . So is Albert in some kind of trouble ? We really don 't know . Oh , sure , I understand . Heh , I wouldn 't tell me either . Hey , Mr. Duncan isn 't home yet . He works construction . We called his boss . He 's been away all week . - How 's it going there ? - Walter 's just getting started . [ CLEARS THROAT ] Emily , I 'm going to count backwards from three . And when I reach one I want you to open your eyes and tell me where you are . Three , two , one . Where are you , Emily ? On the bus . On the way home . Do you see Mr. Duncan ? No . But I hear it . I hear the hum . Look around , Emily . Find Mr. Duncan . EMILY : I see him . - He 's getting off the bus . - Guide her , Walter . You can do this . Emily , listen . Don 't let Mr. Duncan get away . You 'll have to catch up with him . Can you do that ? Yes . WALTER : Follow him , Emily . We need to know where he 's going . What is it ? Shh . Shh . Oh , God . Where are you ? I don 't know . But it 's bad . Oh , God . They 're dead . - They 're all dead . WALTER : Look around , Emily . Describe what you see . Tell me where you are . - I 'm scared . - There 's nothing to be frightened of . Nothing can hurt you . You know what ? Mr. Mallum , maybe if she heard your voice . It might help her . Sweetheart , it 's me . Look around . Tell me what you see . EMILY : I see something . It looks like Latin . [ SPEAKING IN LATIN ] " By the judgment of God , let justice be done " ? - Mm-hm . - I need to borrow your phone , please . [ PHONE RINGING ] - Dunham . - It 's me . It 's a courthouse . It 's happening at a courthouse . Peter , Albert Duncan just got divorced . The settlement was last week . He lost custody of his kids . Maybe he 's not so happy about it . When I count to three , I want you to wake up . I see him . I see Mr. Duncan . He 's holding something . It 's some sort of weird-looking radio . I don 't think it 's a radio . I think it 's a detonator . Duncan 's not the victim . He must be setting up some sort of bomb . [ INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO ] BROYLES : Security pulled surveillance of Duncan 's vehicle entering the garage 20 minutes ago . Assume he 's in the building . - The bomb ? - Given the destruction he couldn 't have that amount of explosives strapped to his person . The way Emily described it , it was as though the ground erupted . So we assume the explosive is beneath the building . Bomb squad 's about to go in . Peter 's gonnajoin them . - I can help . - Sir , we 're ready . Go . We 'll start evacuating the building . Dad , I 'm sorry . Calling the FBI . I know I should have told you . It 's okay , sweetheart . I 'm just really proud of you . But you 're in the system now . It 's only a matter of time before people start showing up ... - No . They 're not like that . Agent Dunham promised . She said no one would harass us anymore . Come on . Let 's get in the house , Em . EMILY : Dad ... - This isn 't a discussion . Go pack you bags . - Diane ? - Dad , please . - What ? - Black van across the street . Just like the one in Baltimore . DIANE : Do what your father says . [ HIGH-PITCHED HUMMING ] JIM : I need a pen . I 'm going to write down the license plate number . Uh , excuse me ? I 'm looking for Judge O 'Malley . Judge is in chambers . Do you have an appointment ? Uh , no , but , um ... MAN [ OVER PA ] : Ladies and gentleman due to a reported emergency please proceed immediately to the nearest exit . Please remain calm and obey the instructions of the court officers . [ OFFICERS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ] - Hey , I got it . OFFICER 1 : Sir ? - Sir . OFFICER 2 : What have we got ? OFFICER 1 : We got a possible . Yeah , move in . [ INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE ] MAN : This way , please . Let 's go . It 's me . We were right . It 's rigged to some remote detonation trigger . - How long will it take to disarm ? - They don 't know . It 's pretty elaborate . - Okay , keep me informed . - Will do . They found the bomb ? If this goes off , we need to clear a 200-meter blast radius . You should help the police set up a perimeter . I know what you 're doing and I 'm not going anywhere . - Olivia . What that man said to you , that you 're gonna die maybe this is what he was talking about . I can 't live my life like that . Or do my job . There 's no reason for you to be here . This thing 's wired with multiple redundancies . Could take hours . That guy could remote-trigger the device any time . Hey . Can you tell me what frequency that bomb is rigged to receive ? Probably . Yeah , why ? What are you thinking ? PETER : Hey , it 's me again . Have everyone turn their radios to 432.5 megahertz . MAN [ OVER PA ] : Ladies and gentlemen , due to a reported emergency please proceed immediately ... Hey . Hey , Judge O 'Malley . You don 't even know who I am . No . Should I ? You took my family from me . And now I 'm gonna take you away from yours . [ STATIC ] BROYLES : It 's over , Mr. Duncan . - We blocked the signal . - Nobody wants to hurt you . So you can just put your hands up and we 'll just walk out of here . No . Nobody 's going anywhere . Albert , you do not want to do this . Don 't . He ... He took everything from me . Okay , I understand why you 're upset , but you can 't do this . You can 't . Albert ? This is not my fault . This is because of him . - This is how it has to end . - No . You 're wrong . Nothing has to happen . Nothing is written in stone . You and I , we don 't have to die here today . Now , whatever happens next is up to you . You are in control . I 'm not ready to die today and I don 't think that you are either . Just think about all these people . They have children too . [ CRYING ] OFFICER : Sir , get down . [ OFFICERS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ] JIM [ ON ANSWERING MACHINE ] : We 're not home , please leave a message . Mr. Mallum , this is Olivia Dunham . We defused the bomb . A lot of people 's lives were saved today . I thought Emily would like to know . Hey , Em ? - Jim ? Jim , what is it ? - They took her . They took Emily . BROYLES [ OVER PHONE ] : We traced the plate number Jim Mallum provided . Boston P.D. Hailed it . It was just a dry-cleaning van . Thanks for letting us know . Her father was wrong . I think he was just being paranoid . I don 't think Emily was abducted at all . - Then where the hell is she ? - I think I might know . OLIVIA : Emily ? Emily . You 're freezing cold . We have to get you out of here . - Her pulse is weak . - I 'll call the ambulance . - Help 's on its way . - It doesn 't matter . There 's nothing anyone can do . It 's just my time . LINCOLN : This is Agent Lee . I need an ambulance at Downey Park right away . OLIVIA : No , Emily . You told me what 's in your drawings is inevitable but you 're wrong . Today we saved all those people because of you . JIM : Emily . God . Emily . EMILY : I 've known for a while . God . Why didn 't you tell me ? I knew you 'd be here . Em , please . They 're on their way . Can you just hold on ? I think you were right . [ SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE ] Everyone has a purpose . I saved those people today . Maybe that was mine . [ CRYING ] PETER : Hey . - Hey . PETER : They told me what happened with the girl . I 'm really sorry . - They said it was some kind of stroke ? - Yeah . The overload of electrical activity in her brain was just too much . - So the thing that gave her , her ability ... - Also killed her . Walter said that even if we 'd known we couldn 't have done anything to prevent it . He says , " A candle that burns twice as bright , burns half as long . " [ SCOFFS ] I 'm guessing you 're not finding that comforting now . No , not as much as he does . PETER : Is that an Observer ? - Is that 's what you call them ? - Yeah . Why , what do you call them ? Well , up until now , we haven 't called them anything . [ CHUCKLING ] - Things really are different here . - What do you know ? Well , they show up at significant events all through history . Well , how do they do that ? Like , some kind of time travel ? No , it 's not really time travel , per se . Uh , it 's more like they exist in all times simultaneously . They don 't experience time the same way that you and I do . So they know what 's going to happen ? I mean , if one of them said something about the future could they be wrong ? Well , no . I don 't really see how they could . They don 't predict the future , Olivia . They 've already experienced it . Did one of them make contact with you ? Have they reached out ? No . [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] - I hope it 's not too late . - No , I , uh ... I just got home . Come in . I wanted to see you . Especially after I spoke with Phillip . He told me what happened to the girl . - Are you all right ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . Really , I am okay . Sweetheart , about what you said when you came to see me this afternoon . I never should have reacted the way I did . I 'm sorry . I should not have accused you . Please , I 'm the one that needs to apologize . What happened to you as a child was unconscionable . We 've come so far , I just forget sometimes how much you 've been expected to forgive . I 'm not angry with you . I thought I was going to die today . And one of the things that I kept thinking was that you ... You wouldn 't know how I felt . You 're the closest thing I have to a mother . And I love you . Oh , Olive . What ? What 's wrong ? I 've just been getting these migraines , that 's all . It 's really not that big of a deal . - Do you have any medicine ? - My doctor gave me some . Good . What about food ? Have you eaten ? - No . - I 'm going to make you some soup . You know , you don 't have to do that . I want to . I 'm the closest thing you have to a mother , remember . Thank you . That would be great . I 'm gonna send some medication over , a new drug we 've been working on . It 's remarkable . [ English - US - SDH ]

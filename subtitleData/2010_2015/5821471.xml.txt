 Previously on Believe ... Inexplicable phenomena have been part of Bo 's life . They think that whoever controls her abilities will control the world . You are the global authority on the conscious and unconscious mind . She 's your daughter . Bo is your daughter . It was Nina , right ? Bo 's mom ? Nina Adams ? Yes . - You 're my dad , aren 't you ? - Don 't let me lose you just when I found you . She can 't control her gifts . How it manifests is completely unpredictable . We 've never had a subject degrade this suddenly . No one 's ever been the focus of an attack by Bo . We have to concentrate our efforts on Shawn . No , Shawn is too fragile . - One wrong move , he could snap in two . - Don 't call me weak . I need you to show me you have the strength to do what it takes . - You will have your weapon , General . - And when you 're stronger , you can control this gift that you have . I don 't want to control it , I don 't want to use it . If I don 't use it , I 'll never hurt anyone . I just don 't want it anymore . Brandice Comstock has been at the agency for 20 years and has survived several administrations . Space flight isn 't just for astronauts anymore . But , it 's also not for anyone with less than $ 250,000 ... Yeah , maybe next year . Bo , wake up . You 're having a bad dream . Where are we ? You tell me . You 've been navigating since we left Philly . " Turn left , turn right " . I don 't wanna go anywhere . Not even for a burger and a cherry coke , huh ? It 's just fast-food , Bo . I 'm not asking you to levitate . I know you 're still tired . That one . Good choice . Bolton Landing , here we come . _ Bo and Tate , - where are they at this moment ? - Heading north . It 's ... it 's been four days . And we 've spoken to them every one of those four days . We should bring her back . She 's scared of her powers and she 's been through so much . Channing ... Bo is growing up faster than we would have liked , yes . But what choice do we have ? Orchestra is coming , and she needs to be ready . Bolton Landing , New York . The car is heading toward Bolton Landing . Bolton Landing . Now , why is that name so familiar ? There . Tate 's Limo and Childcare . This is the fourth time I 've called you in 30 minutes , Mr. Tate . The agreement : the phone rings , you answer . Yeah , well my kid 's an eating machine . I must have left it in the car when we stopped for lunch . Organic food , yes ? Nothing but the best . Good . How 's Bo doing ? I don 't know , man . She 's all moody and recalcitrant . Very funny , Mr. Tate . Physically , she 's fine ? She 's all right , still not wanting to do any spookies though . What 's Bo 's supposed to be doing ? You 're in Bolton Landing ? Yeah , Eye in the Sky , we are . Then you 're already doing it . There 's someone there who needs Bo 's help . A missing woman , Laura Campbell disappeared about three weeks ago . Blonde , 24 years old , worked at the local VFW . What ? You want us to find her ? ' Cause , someone here isn 't exactly being helpful . Mr. Tate , trust her . She was born to help people . She will figure it out . Where do you say she worked ? Veterans of Foreign Wars . You check into that . Then we will rendezvous in a few hours . What 's wrong ? Why did you want us to park here ? - The spot was empty . - No coincidences with you , huh , kid ? Here you go , Bo . Winter said you led us here , so , have a look around . It 's ... no , it can be fun . You 'd be surprised . - Your " Bo-DAR " going off ? - Nothing yet . - Oh , I 'm sorry , man . - No problem . - Okay . - Okay , thank you . - Go talk to her . - No . Why not ? She looks upset . You like upset people . You like them more than you like chocolate . You 're not funny . Bad things are gonna happen . Good morning , Doctor Boyle . Shawn . Did Doctor Skouras tell you what happened ? - What do you mean ? - To Joshua . Did he tell you what happened to Joshua ? It was the degrade , Shawn . He just pushed his powers too far . It 's just his body . It just shut down . He was in pain . You don 't have to worry about him . Not anymore . - How are you feeling ? - I 'm fine . - Let me take a look at your hand . - No , j ... don 't come near me . Medium ? - Uh , blood-rare if you got any . - I can make that happen . We have something in common . - What 's that ? - Pissed off tweens . - I saw you tussle with yours on the way in . - Oh yeah . I saw you go a few rounds with yours too . - Yeah . - It 's tough , man . Kids . Girls . Mom says I have to stay with him on the weekend , ' cause ... it 's in the agreement . I hate it though . I mean , he used to be fun , but now it 's just like he 's some creepy stranger . He never sleeps , and he acts like he 's asleep when he 's awake . He 's worried about you though . I mean , I guess , he is . Because he is your dad . - Divorced ? - Oh , no man , I never married . Take it from me , that is a bullet dodged . Steve Vignati . Max . Max Walters . Do you know the girl that went missing ? Most everyone does . It 's ... not that big of a town . Took her in a couple years back . Took her in ? Yeah , she 's a good kid . She made some mistakes , but she straightened herself out . So you 're a cop ? Almost everyone here is . It 's put on by the department . Well , here you go . You all right ? You all right , man ? Sorry , hit the ... let me get you a fresh one . Hey Vince , can we get a fresh patty ? I 'm sorry about that man , it will just take a minute . Your dad 's cool though . He really isn 't . He could be a movie star . Maybe in a horror movie . Come on , Bobby Flay . Some of us actually wanna eat . Another of Bolton Landing 's finest . - My partner Elaine . - Oh , nice to meet you . So I see Rachel got a new BFF . That 's Max 's kid , uh ... - Bo . - Bo . Yeah . You two new in town ? Oh , no , no , we 're just passing through . - We should ... actually be hitting the road . - No , come on . No , no , no no . Give them a few more minutes , huh ? Let them get to know each other . - Stevie ? - Laura , Laura , please ... Laura , please . Hey ! Hey ! - What the hell ? - Get a medic . All the clown fish are named Nemo . And the yellow tang , that 's Ellen . My dad feeds them when I 'm not here . I wish I could take them to my mom 's though . But , he likes feeding them when you 're not here . He 'd miss them . Maybe , maybe not . He misses you . I don 't care . You care a little . Kinda like my dad . Acts all grouchy , but he still cares a little . That 's so cool . Is it magic ? Thanks , Lainey . I owe you one . Nah . Thank this guy . If he hadn 't pulled you off , you would have burned down to the bone . Nah , it was nothing . Listen , we should get going . No , no , no , I haven 't seen Rachel this up in a long time . Don 't . Come on . At least stay for dinner . Well , I have a shift that started 10 minutes ago , so I 'm gonna go upstairs , and get cleaned up . - You all right ? - Yeah . Max is here . I cannot believe that I was that clumsy . It could have been the booze caused the clumsy . - Not that it 's my business . - No , it 's not . Look , man , I get it . I know you think you understand what 's going on here ... I know what you 're thinking . You 're right . I shoulda ... I should have slowed down sooner . It 's just this case . - It 's got me wound so tight . - I bet . Being a cop does teach you to ... recognize some other things . How long were you in for ? You eat like someone 's gonna steal your food . Got the prison yard stare . - Seven years . - Phew . Lucky seven ... No wonder you and Bo are so awkward . You 're new at being a dad . Very . It 's tough when you 're not around . Can 't say it gets any easier . Listen , before you burned your hand , you said " Laura " . No , you must have heard me wrong . Oh my God ... Oh my God , Steve ... Lieutenant . Uh , - Connor is covering my shift . - No , no , that 's all good now . - Can you step outside a minute ? - Sure . - Look , I don 't like this ... - That was an accident , Lt , clumsy . No , no , that 's not it . It 's , uh ... we 've all worked ourselves into exhaustion - on Laura 's case . - Well , got to , there 's no ... We 've worked every angle . We followed every lead . I 'm out of options . I need you to come down to the station . A witness saw you with Laura the night she vanished . No way in hell you 're going down there . - Stay out of this , El . - It 's all right , it 's all right . I gotta go talk to my daughter . - Give it back . - No way . Whoa , whoa , hey , ladies , you wanna slow down a little bit ? Gonna have to write you a ticket . Hey , girls . Girls ! Girls ! Did you draw this ? B ... Bo did . It 's good , isn 't it ? Honey ... How ... how did you know ? How do you know about this ... about this thing ? - I don 't know , I made it up . - No , this is in my head . - It 's in my head . How do you know that ? - Hey , - go easy , man . - Where is it ? How do you know about it ? Where ... where is this ? - Where is that ? - Hey , hey ! - How do you know about it ? - Hey , Steve , back up , man ! - I keep seeing it ! I keep seeing it ! - Hey ! Ok , ok , calm down ! Oh my God . What ... what have I done ? What did I do ? - What did I do ? - You come with us now . Come here , buddy . We 'll get this sorted out . I should go be there with him . We 'll take care of Rachel . We got this . You go with him , all right ? Laura 's some place cold . She 's not why we 're here . He is . - Where 's Rachel ? - Upstairs with Bo . Uh , I don 't want her to see me like this . I 'm gonna go wash up . - They cut him loose ? - No charges , but they 're coming . Can you keep an eye on him for a couple of hours ? - Yeah . - Thanks . I thought you were done with that . They think I killed her . And now Rachel thinks I did something , and she 's scared of me . I 'm scared . God , what if I did it ? Bo says you didn 't . And trust me , she 's never wrong . You saw what she drew . Bo ... she has a gift . She ... knows things . It 's gonna be all right . Trust me . Who are you calling ? Someone who can help . Is there something you weren 't telling me , Roman ? - I don 't understand . - I 'm worried about Shawn . He asked if you told me what happened to Joshua . I don 't know what Shawn meant . I 'm sure he 's upset by Joshua 's death . Possibly . How are we coming with the genetic antidote therapy ? The results are erratic . There 's no guarantee it 'll ever work . Obviously , it didn 't work for Joshua . Well , keep on it . Shawn has another training this afternoon . I expect you to be at that session . Steve Vignati , this is Milton Winter and Channing ... Janice Channing . These people can help you . So you guys can turn back time ? No , Mr. Vignati , not exactly . But that ... that 'd be helpful . Uh , may we ? Sure , come on in . Do you believe you did something to Laura Campbell ? I blackout sometimes . My partner gave me a ride home from the bar the night that Laura disappeared , and so I ... I don 't know . Bo doesn 't believe you did . Neither do I. You 're a good man , Mr. Vignati . I keep ... seeing things . I see Laura dead . But you 've always seen things , haven 't you ? Ever since I was a kid . Pictures of things . Moving pictures of things that happened or were about to . For a long time I thought I was crazy . But I do read a suspect better than anybody . I knew when my kid was lying . I knew when my wife fell in love with someone else . You see visions , you ... hear voices , it 's very easy to think you 're ... crazy . You think you 're sick , but you 're not . You 're not . It 's just never been like this , where ... It 's like I did something wrong , like I hurt somebody . You didn 't . Mr. Vignati , I 've worked with people like yourself , for many many years . You take on the emotions of other people , their anger , sadness and even sometimes their guilt . These visions can be overwhelming . Maybe Bo can help you sort them out . You didn 't hurt her . You didn 't ... hurt her . So ? We 're not safe here . Bolton Landing is bound to be on Orchestra 's radar . Thanks to your new friend . Skouras will have someone watching him . So , what , you 're just gonna cut bait ? Do something ! The guy 's about to be accused of a murder he didn 't do . It 's not that simple . - Bo said we 're here to help him . - Yeah . So ? Help him . Steve said that his partner picked him up the night that Laura disappeared . - Yeah . - Talk to her . She 'll know who he was with . And take Bo and Rachel with you . If there are eyes on Steve , then , we 'll deal . All right ? This town is looking for a scapegoat . They got one guy that just thinks he saw Steve talking to Laura . That makes him an easy target . We need to know what you saw that night . It doesn 't matter . Everything matters . Whatever you saw matters . It can ... it can help . It 's more than what someone saw ... It 's your behaviour . How it changed so abruptly . Honey , look , I ... I love you , but you 've always been a little off . Just a little bit off . Then Laura disappears , and something in you twisted , and she was the pivot point , everyone saw that . The night you picked him up from the bar , was he with anybody ? I don 't know . Maybe . - It was so ... - If you know something , please , Elaine , please ... You were blackout drunk , Steve . You were talking about Laura . You said you took her ... you said you took her into the woods . You said that ... You had mud on your shoes on your clothes ... Why didn 't you say anything to Lt. ? Because you 're my friend , you 're my partner . I didn 't want to believe it . I don 't want to believe . I have to turn myself in . Let it go , just ... I need to know what the truth is . You 'll hate the truth you find . - Take me to the station . - No . You 're not going down for something you didn 't do . Where did she say the mud was from ? The woods near the VFW . That 's what I keep seeing , the woods , some weird symbol . All right . That 's where we 're going then . Fantastic . Excuse me , sir ? Hmm . Last call 30 minutes ago . - Skouras ? - Game is on , my dear . I 've seen the woods , and this tree ... this forked tree . You sure you don 't wanna go with me ? I just ... I can 't . It 's all right , man . I got this . Hey , it 's gonna be all right , honey . You say " trust Bo " . I trust Bo . She said Steve didn 't do it . I believed her . You believed him too . Oh , yeah , right up until I started finding body parts ! Tate ... calm down . Bo is right . No matter how things appear . She 's right . You know , she has been scared and upset . Maybe ... - she 's confused , it wouldn 't be the first time . - Stop . She 's not wrong . Please have faith . She can help him . She can help him . Can you tell me what I 'm seeing ? - Shawn ? - I c ... I can 't . You have to try , Shawn . No , we have to stop . Shawn , that 's enough . - We 're done . - No ! I think we 've done enough for today . Ok ? Get away from me ! Shawn ! I 'll show you . I 'll show you all of you . Stop it ! Milton ? Hey , angel . Hey . You must be Rachel . Yeah ? Uh , I 'm Milton . Rachel , can I borrow your room for a few minutes ? I just need to talk to Bo . It 's ok . Thank you . Rachel ? Your dad 's gonna be fine . I don 't want to . Bo ... You can 't ignore who you are . You can 't . Sweetie , listen . You can 't ignore this gift . We have to learn how to help you use it . You can save Rachel 's dad . He really , really , really needs us . I know you 've been through a lot , and your gifts have scared you . Let ... let me try to help you , all right ? - I can help you through it ... - No , I don 't want to do it ! You can do it . I don 't want to do it . - You can just do it ! - Wait ! Milton , I just don 't want to . Leave me alone ! Steve ? I think somebody should take me in . Why don 't we talk for a while , first , huh ? That ... sound like a plan ? There 's nothing to talk about . I know these visions are overwhelming . But we can sort them out . I can help you . Walk me through this . Let 's make sense of what you saw . You do know the answer . Who killed Laura ? It 's here . And it is here . The night , that Laura disappeared , is that the first time ... that you saw a vision of her ? Yes . Where were you ? It was a Friday . I went to visit the VFW after work . Half the department are regulars . I see it . - I know . - Bring something . And when was the last time you saw a vision of her ? In the car . - Are you ok ? - I 'm ok . Did you ... did you see if I did it ? - Just ... just ... - We gotta keep going . I need to know . Please don 't stop . - You can 't stop now . Don 't stop . - I won 't stop . Tell me if I did it . You have to tell me . Please . Please , keep going . Don 't stop . Hey , hey , hey ! Come on , come on . - Please , you have to keep going ! - Milton ! - I can show you where it is ! - Where what is ? This ! I know where Laura is . We ... we ... we ... have to go . We have to go . Come on , quickly ! Quickly ! - Sorry . - Where is he ? He 's got Bo . Is she out here ? Is that what it is ? Was it me ? There . The water tower . The mark is on the water tower . We should get off . Did I put her here ? We have to get off ! - Help me please . I need to know ! Tell me ! - No * * * . Are you ok ? I got you . I got you . Look out ! It 's all right . It 's ok , it 's ok , sweetie . It 's ok . I got you ! I got you ! It 's ok . Get inside . Milton ! It 's ok . Mr. Vignati , don 't be afraid . I see things too . Sometimes they 're scary . But it 's gonna be ok . Because now you know the truth . Thank you . I understand now . - It was you . - What ? It was you . You were in the bar with Laura that night . - You 've been taking bribes , to get people off . - No , no . She found out and she threatened to out you , she was blackmailing you . You framed me . You are my partner .. I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry ... I 'm so ... I 'm so sorry . It 's gonna be all right , honey . It 's all right . Everything 's gonna be all right now . I promise . You know what ? They 're gonna be just fine . I know . I took his power away . What ? It 's bad for some people . How long has he been like that ? Almost an hour . I 'm not weak . What did he say ? " I 'm not weak . " Winter ? What you did with Steve ... you can 't do that . It was worth it , Channing . Helped Bo see what she needed to do . You realize she took away the man 's power ? If Bo can do that with one person ... she can do it with many ... and we can stop Orchestra . We can win . What you got there ? A family . This is Steve and this is Rachel . - Looks like they 're gonna be ok , huh ? - I think so . You know , what you did , helping those two ... it was all right . Why are people always so surprised when you help other people ? That 's because not everyone is like that . They should be . It 'd create less problems . You got it all figured out . What 's going on with this one ? Oh , that 's me and Mom . What are you guys doing ? You dancing ? Hmm . You know , that was your mom 's favorite thing to do . Really ? Did you dance with her ? Yeah , sometimes . Show me . Really ? Your mom liked the slow stuff , the ... kind of stuff that takes you out of the old day-to-day . Like that . Gonna dance ? Your mother was the expert . I have two left feet . Come on . Please ? - This is nothing . Come on . - Ok , so you just go ... And then back over here . Like that , and then out . Spin , spin , dip , zip ! Do another . And ... dancing ...

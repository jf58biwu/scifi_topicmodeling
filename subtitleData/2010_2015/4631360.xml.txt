 It was just a normal day in Eureka . Day 's not over yet . Yeah . Like that was going to last . Hello , 1947 . Confused ? Let me clarify . The five of us got transported back in time through some wormhole thingy thanks to the Bridge Device . We eventually found our way back home , but , surprise , home wasn 't exactly the way we left it . Henry ? Married . Zane and Jo ? Never dated . But Jo 's in charge of G.D. Security . Kevin ? Different , much to Allison 's surprise . And Fargo ? Head of Global Dynamics , much to everyone 's surprise . Oh , and Dr. Old Spice hitched a ride with us back to the present , but there 's one crappy rule . We can 't tell anyone . If people ever found out about our trip , there 'd be trouble . Some of us had a harder time with it than others . I 'm not your Henry . Not yet . It 's way off target . And that 's a residential area . That was Jo 's house , so she 's living with me for a while . And I finally kissed Allison , 63 years ago . But , of course , Dr. Charles Grant had to get in the way . At least let me buy you a drink . One drink . Don 't plan the wedding just yet . May the best man win . But that 's Eureka for you . Same town , big changes . You know , I think I like the hair . Look very mature . Yeah , and it really sells the fake ID to the bars in Cambridge . Ah ... Kidding . Unclench . Yeah , so when does Lucas come back from MIT ? He 's not . Internship in Geneva , which isn 't a bad thing . Ah , you guys having trouble ? That would make it a lot easier . No , it 's just he 's a great guy , but , you know , college changes you . What you want , who you want . Oh , and that 's not hair boy . Maybe what starts in the friend zone should stay in the friend zone . Sheriff . Hey , Zoe . Hey , Zane . Looking good . Thanks . Ooh , that 's my girl . That 's my girl . Hey ! Wow , Jenna 's gotten so big . Allison seems so happy . Yeah , yeah , she does . Fresh baked cinnamon rolls , raisin-free and icing rich . Just the way you like it . Welcome home . Oh , thanks , Vince . It 's so good to be back . Well , I think I 'll have one , thanks , Vince . Oh . Okay , so , I think some of the greatest romances in history started in the friend zone . Like what ? And TV characters do not count . So , you ready for spa day ? I 've got us booked for Shangri-La facials and mani-pedis . What ? Shangri-La facial ? Well , this doesn 't happen by magic , my friend . I can 't wait . So , what are you guys talking about ? Whether it 's better to stay with someone safe , but dull . Or take a risk on someone new . I think newer isn 't always better . You 've already found someone new . That obvious ? Well , nothing 's happened yet , we 've just been holo-Skyping . But he 's funny and smart and so hot . Yeah , and I think that 's my cue to leave . I 'll meet you outside . All right . Okay . God . Funny , smart , and hot . Sounds like a trifecta . Yeah . I don 't know , I mean , he 's a little bit older . If he makes you happy , go for it . Life 's short and everything can change in a blink . Oh . That 's my contractor . Wait until you see the plans for my new house . Zimmer , what 's going on ? Let me get your coat . Thank you . A gentleman always takes street side . Were all men as chivalrous in your day ? If they wanted a chance with a gal like you , they were . Well , I say we need more men like you in 2010 . You know what we didn 't have in my day ? Coffee like this . I enjoyed the highballs the other night . The drinks ? Oh , yes . So did I. Thank you . How about we go crazy next time and make it dinner ? Uh , well ... Hey , guys . Uh , why aren 't you catching up on 60 years of fun facts ? Because I find the present far more alluring . That 's great . Um , I need you . Police business . Could take a while . Oh , okay , sport . Ladies , to be continued . Police business ? Well , all my business is police business . So what 's up , Carter ? Well , it 's really more of a longer conversation . Uh , maybe you and I could grab a bite . I just ate . No , not ... Oh ... " I just ate . " No , later . Like , say , dinner ? Oh . Um , okay , well , Kevin 's going to be at Dre 's and I have the nanny tonight . Yeah , sure , what time ? Uh , say , 8 : 00 ? Yeah , that sounds good . Okay . Hey , Jenna . Say goodbye to Carter . Bye . Why 'd it take me four years to do that ? Well , tell him if he doesn 't move that thing today , I 'll move it for him . They haven 't even poured the foundation for my house , which means I get to keep living with the both of you and SARAH and her mechanical boyfriend and , oh , my God , I need my own space . Mechanical boyfriend ? Uh , SARAH 's been spending time with Deputy Andy . Your house is getting more action than either of us . I try not to think about it . So what 's the holdup on the swinging new bachelorette pad ? Some pinhead named Thurgood found a fossil on the site and shut down construction . Wait , Derek ? Derek ? Who 's Derek ? Oh , Dr. Derek Thurgood . He taught my paleoanthropology class last year at Tesla . The guy 's a genius . Really ? Well , why don 't you come and watch me kick his smart ass off my property . Well , let 's . You don 't know what a big deal this is . I 'm sorry , you 're going to have to give us more time . You 've had three days to move it . Well , I was working on it , but this little intimidation stunt of yours isn 't helping you . Hey , Zoe , welcome back . Congratulations , Derek . This is really cool . Oh , really cool . So take your fancy laser shovel and haul it back to G.D. Uh , it 's a delicate process and it can 't be rushed . Besides , who knows what else we might find here ? What exactly did we find here ? The distal phalange of a fifteen thousand-year old pre-Clovis culture hominid . A pinky . What , that 's it ? That 's a big deal , Dad . Come on . Then remove it . Well , I would , but boss lady Zimmer thought it would be funny to push me into Flash-Crete . Into what now ? It 's Flash-Crete . PVA-enhanced molecular-bonded concrete . Three-second set time . And he fell into it . I had a little help . If I 'd helped you would 've gone in face first . All right , let 's get Indiana Jones out of the wall here . You got a chisel ? Come on . Here . It 's de-polymerizing spray . For the clumsy and irritating . What about my house ? With the dojo and the firing range in basement . It was ... Ah ! See for yourself . In Eureka , scientific discovery always trumps construction . It 's in the town charter . Smells orange-y . Yeah , it 's the solvent . Dr. Fargo wanted this house fast-tracked . What am I supposed to do now ? Go home and brush up on local civics . I thought she 'd never leave . You know , Derek , if you have time I 'd love to see the distal phalange . Well , I 'd love to show it to you . It 's just over here . Carter , you have to do something . I know , but ... ... pinky . Yeah , it actually ... Are they flirting ? I meant about my house . Great , it 's a 911 from Fargo . All right , Fargo , what 's the emergency ? Shh ... You 're running sonic protocols ? Big Brother could be eavesdropping . On what ? On me . Seems my mug may have drawn some unwanted attention from the D.O.D. They 've been snooping around Dr. Grant 's personnel file . The one I manufactured . If they know I falsified documentation ... Then they know that I 'm not Charles Grant , G.D. Historian . But Trevor Grant , G.D. History . We could be in a lot of trouble . Try sanctioned . We violated time travel protocols . They 're going to lock us up like lab rats . I don 't like the sound of that . Forever . Or that . What 's our play ? We trace the checks directly to their source . Hack the Pentagon ? Are you insane ? The D.O.D. Mainframe has dozens of firewalls laced with info-mines along every data path . It 's like trying to hack the Matrix . And , as much as it pains me to say , we need to get help from " The One . " Working with Derek is a chance to be part of history . You really want to hang with " Mister I found a pinky " ? I thought you and Jo were going to the spa . Oh , she postponed . You know , plus Derek and I have time at the AMS lab tomorrow to start carbon dating . You know , that skeleton could be the oldest North American hominid ever found . So ? Speaking of dating , check you out . Thank you . Hold on , photo op . Oh , your first real date with Allison . Uh , finally . This is big . Oh , crap . My phone 's in my bag . I must have left it at the dig site . I got time . I could run you over . Great . Great . SARAH , door . There you go . Oh , that 's weird . Derek 's car 's still here . Yeah . Derek ? I think I left it in the pit . Be careful . Derek ? Dad ! Any chance that 's just a really good statue of Thurgood ? No , there 's definitely a person encased in there . Prepare him for autopsy , please . It 's so horrible . You okay ? He was such an amazing teacher . He inspired everyone . Wait , where are you going ? He would want everyone to focus on the find , so ... I 'm going to let everyone know . Well , I 've never seen anything like this before . Yeah . Or this . Got a date ? Actually , yeah . Dinner ? Oh , oh . Oh , you meant a date . Yeah , I did . I 'm so sorry , I just wasn 't expecting , um ... Really ? Carter ... Look , we 've got to focus , shall we ? Yeah , you 're right . Um , okay . Um , so it looks like Thurgood was dropped in a vat of cement . Or pushed in . I 'll go check with Zimmer . And change out of my clothes . Oh , my God . His heart 's beating . Carter , he 's still alive in there . Sheriff , I told you before , I 'd never use Flash-Crete on a person . Except when you did . Okay , but not on a person 's entire person . Mmm-hmm . And tell me again what you did after I left you yesterday . My crew cleaned up the site and then cleared out . Thurgood was still mucking about in his pit when we went back to the warehouse . I swear . Hey ! Hey ! Wait , you 're not going to leave me in here are you ? On what charges ? Probable cause . Or just because . Take your pick . It 's beautiful , Henry . What 's the occasion ? You and me . A new beginning . And I 've got everything here . I 've got plantain , Caribbean sautéed pork and Vincent 's famous sangria . All my favorites . Something wrong ? No , no , it 's perfect . Recreating our first date was a lovely idea . Recreate ? He did this , too ? Other Henry . I 'm sorry , Grace . I didn 't know . How could you ? But really , Henry , I love this . Come on , let 's have some sangria . Not to worry . My Flash-Crete solvent is like elixir of the gods . It works miracles on skin . It 's our most popular treatment at the Shangri-La spa and it takes only seconds . Dr. Vicelli , it 's been seconds with no improvement . In fact , whatever he 's covered with is getting thicker . Yeah , I 'm afraid that this one is kinda out of my league . I mean , your situation , I can help . What , you mean the situation of my face ? I 'm sorry , I do that . It 's part of the job . I mean really , you look great . But you know in five years , just ... Prep for laser surgery . Let 's get this stuff off of him before it kills him . Yes , Doctor . That 's a good idea . Sonic protocols . This just gets curiouser and curiouser . Less talking , more typing . You know , it might help a smidge if you tell me what I 'm looking for . Just get in first . The D.O.D. Uses an application gateway . I can get in a lot of trouble for this . I think I deserve a fair trade for my services . So , who wants to start the bidding , hmm ? You 're trying to play us , sport ? I just think a little compensation for my particularly awesome set of illegal skills is in order . Zane , I know it 's a stretch , but if you could try not to be a selfish jackass . I really could use a new quantum fluctuation generator . Fine , now get on with it . You 're the boss . We 'll start by cutting 0.5 millimeters . Hold on . Is that a tattoo ? Looks like an octopus ? His skin isn 't covered in concrete , it is concrete . Hello ? Anyone here ? Hello ? Hello ? Oh ! Ah ! Sheriff , please . Help me . Oh , my God . Well , I don 't know , but they 're both alive and petrifying from the outside in . Well , how does that affect their clothes ? Well , you remember the woman who was fused to the fabric of her couch after sitting there for six years ? No . I mean , what , who ? Well , it 's like that , but much faster . Oh , that 's disgusting . At the rate that it 's moving inward , it 's only a matter of hours before their vital organs solidify . Even less for Derek . How does that happen ? More detail . Well , in theory any organic material can be converted into minerals through impregnation by a silicate like quartz . Okay , okay . Um , uh-huh ... Carter , what are you doing ? Main ingredient in Flash-Crete is silica . I used to work construction . I 'm good with my hands . Carter , Flash-Crete has been used safely in buildings all over Eureka . Well , maybe somebody re-jiggered the formula . Dr. Zimmer does have a PhD in materials engineering . Bad news , Dr. Zimmer . You 've gone from probable cause to ... Stone . Well ? Well , she 's lucky that you found her . She 's okay . Well , she 's not okay , but she 's not ... Dead , yeah . I have the analysis you asked for . If there 's anything else I can do , please ... Oh , my ! What ? Sorry , nothing . Uh , here . Please . First treatment 's on me . Oh , wow ! Carter the Flash-Crete is just Flash-Crete . Same formula as always . No re-jiggering or ... None . The Flash-Crete is not causing the fossilization . Wait , I thought you said these guys were petrifying . Carter , petrification is a form of fossilization . Petri ... I think we might be blaming the wrong guy . Hmm ... Interesting . Interesting ? It 's not supposed to be interesting . Well , the people checking up on you are real badasses . Who are we talking ? NSA ? CIA ? Worse . IRS . Seriously , who claims 11 dependents ? What ? Yeah , accounting flagged your W-4 . The D.O.D. Accounting department ? They 're the ones poking around in your file ? That 's supposed to be a one , not an 11 . Larry ! So , anything else you want to know while I 'm in there ? Launch codes , defense plans , TARDIS blueprints , what ? Go away . Fine . Oh , and Doc , you might want to fill out your own paperwork next time . I 'll do that , thank you . Nice doing business with you , Fargo . Hey , Dad . Hey . How well do you know , Thurgood ? Hold on . That 's weird . What 's that ? Maybe not as well as I thought . Check this out . Oh , yeah , I don 't know what that is . Well , I 'm pretty sure that means it 's not a pre-Clovis hominid phalange . Which would mean I might know what 's causing Derek to petrify . Do you think you can get me into his home lab ? Well , nothing out of the ordinary . Unless you count all of it . So , what are we looking for , exactly ? Derek 's PERM solution . Derek 's PERM solution ... Maybe he keeps it next to his European man purse . PERM as in " permineralization . " What 's it do exactly ? Oh ... Oh ! I think I found it . Okay , no sign of quartz in your cellular walls . That 's it ? So she 's okay , then ? Yes , along with the rest of the archeological team . Great . I can 't believe Derek was trying to pull a Piltdown . A what down , now ? Well , Thurgood 's skeleton was a Piltdown man . An ape-like skeleton found in England in 1912 . Turned out to be a hoax . So the skeleton isn 't real ? Well , it 's not really old . It looked old . Yeah , that 's the point . The PERM solution , it introduces silica and calcite , and it does it super fast . We used it in Derek 's class to study the process of fossilization . Yeah , but a skeleton treated with PERM would never stand up to radiometric dating . Yeah , unless Derek tweaked the photon emissions rate . The quartz in the skeleton that he found didn 't look right , so I measured it . It was like PERM on steroids . So he rejiggered the PERM ? I mean , I knew someone rejiggered something . But now that we know that Thurgood 's PERM is the culprit , I may be able to synthesize an anti-serum to reverse the effects . Question , how come some people at the site got fossilized and others didn 't ? Like Zoe . I don 't know , maybe a genetic predisposition or an allergic reaction . I 'll have the archeological lab closed off , test anyone who came in contact with it at the site . Great . I 'll go over there and quarantine the PERM . Can I talk to you for a sec ? Look , I know this has been tough on you , so why don 't you get away for a little while ? To the spa ? I can 't go now . Look , I know there 's nothing you can do . It would make me feel better , and by the time you get back , Derek will probably be his old fraudulent , flesh-colored self . How can you be so sure ? I can 't , but Allison 's working on it . Thanks . So what now ? Well , the computer 's running panels on how to reverse engineer the PERM 'S effects . An antidote ? Well , that 's the hope . Great , keep me posted . Okay . Hey , could I borrow you ? Um ... When Grant asked you out , did you think that was a date date ? Well , yeah , sure . Why not me ? Really ? Okay , um , A , you 've never asked me for a date . B , you kissed me and acted like it never happened . I mean , I know you had to come back to Tess , but , seriously , it 's been over a month . And C ... Hold on . You 've been thinking about the kiss ? It 's been over 60 years . I don 't know , who can remember ? You thought about it . Carter , go set up the quarantine . Yes , ma 'am . You did . The soil definitely runneth over with modified PERM . Must have leeched from the treated skeleton and into the surrounding area . That 's it . We 're ready ? All right , hold on . Consider the area quarantined . Great . Thanks . You 're welcome . Sorry for pulling you away from Grace . No , you didn 't . She went out . Beach Blanket Bingo wasn 't a hit ? No , it was , both times . Turns out , I took her on the exact same first date as the Henry from her timeline . No . She was okay with that ? Yeah . No , no . She was wonderful . I just want to give her the passion and surprises that she deserves . But , you know , anything I come up with , you know , he 's probably already done . It 's hard to win a girl when you 're competing against yourself . Exactly , so what do you think I should do ? Well , um , you could find the person you 'd be least likely to go to for advice , and ask them . I thought that 's what I was doing . I walked right into that one , didn 't I ? Mmm-hmm . Thanks , Jack . Good luck . Hmm . I can 't relax . Derek ... Is in the best hands possible . Trust me . Okay . I 'm really glad you were here , Grace . Yeah , me , too . All right , so tell me all about Harvard . Guys , grades , I want all the gossip . Grades are good , guys are complicated . " Guys , " as is someone new ? Well , he 's not exactly new . I needed help with a physics model last semester . He totally knew how to use an Ornstein-Zernike equation in molecular-electronic structure theory . Okay , that is hot . Right . It 's that rush you get when you 're first getting to know someone , you know ? Yeah . It 's too bad you can 't have both . Yeah , too bad . What happened ? Derek 's system is shutting down , I 'm losing him . I thought you were onto something with the PERM . So did I , but the new compound didn 't reverse the petrification . It just slowed it down . Wait , you were partially right , right ? Well , Thurgood and the others must have been exposed to some sort of bio-activator , something that changed the PERM in some way . I 'm guessing there 's lots of those ? I 'm gonna have to cross-reference everything in their system , see if I can find a match . Everything ... Do they have that sort of time ? The others , maybe , but Derek ... Um ... I 'll ask Zoe . Maybe she knows if they have something in common . Zoe , hey . Hey , can I talk to you for a second ? Yeah . I was just wondering maybe if you wanted to ... I don 't know ... Okay , yeah , we 'll talk about it later . Okay . Sheriff . Zane . Zoe . That 's him . Zane ? Yeah . He 's the new guy ? Well , I know what you 're thinking , but he 's really sweet once you get to know him . When did you get to know him ? Just give it a chance . No . He 's a train wreck . Just ask Jo . Jo ? Why would I ask her ? Those two hate each other . Well , because of his poor work ethic , which ... Look , we can discuss this later , okay ? Allison needs our help . Dad ... Look , something activated the PERM . We 've got to find out what it is before more people are affected . Come on . Dad ! What , what ? It 's too late . I can 't feel my hands . It 's all over me . Just look at me , okay ? You stay with me . You look ... You 're going to be okay . All right , it 's going to be okay . Damn . What 's wrong ? It 's blocked . It 's ... Allison . Stay with me . Look at me , all right ? Just look at my eyes . Still might be able to get into the sub-clavian artery . When you become a doctor , never do that . All right , sweetie . You 're going to get sleepy . Just relax . There , see ? It 's going to be all right . Is that a cure ? No , but we will find one , okay ? Just stay with her . I love you . Lupo ! You going somewhere ? Just grabbing some stuff for Carter in case he spends the night with Zoe . Is she okay ? I hope so . I 've got to go . No , wait . I pulled something off the D.O.D. Mainframe you need to see . It 's Grant 's personnel file . Two felonies in one day . Impressive . Not as impressive as his profile . It 's a fake . What makes you think that ? Come on , when you 've created as many aliases as I have , you know what to look for . Dr. Charles Grant reads like a textbook cover job . Chuck 's hiding something . Like what ? I don 't know . You 're the head of security , don 't you want to find out ? Zane , Grant went through detailed background checks like everyone at G.D. I did them myself . Look , I know we 've had our trust issues , but something isn 't right about this guy . I can feel it . He is Dr. Charles Grant , historian . Trust me . Look , I really got to go . Knock , knock . Come . Hey , I didn 't know you tickled the ivories . Oh , this was there for you in the mailroom , Dr. Grant . I thought I 'd deliver it to you personally . Thanks . Leave it over there . All right . You know all I got was a paperweight when I started working here . Not that it isn 't practical . I just would 've preferred an iTablet or a Cheval Nuit from 1947 . Let me see that . You know , they say it 's not healthy to drink alone . But I 'm available to hang out . Like guys do . Right , you 're busy . Like everyone always is . We 've tested hundreds of potential bio-activators . Nothing has reacted with the PERM . It 's like looking for a needle in a haystack . We need to narrow it down . Well , Allison , you gave Zoe a clean bill of health earlier . I know , I 'm sorry . I 'm trying to figure it out . I 'm not blaming you , but if Zoe was fine then , then she obviously came into contact with the bio-activator since then . Well , we need to find out everything she was exposed to in the last couple hours and that would narrow it down . Well , I know where to look . Yeah ? Okay , we 've got to go . Come on , Carter . I believe that Zoe had the Shangri-La special . Ah , yes . Molecular steam bath , mani-pedi , deep penetration for all skin types , it 's very refreshing . Yeah , I smell oranges . Yeah , like at the construction site . Right . Ah , well , you have a very keen nose . With unfortunately roomy pores , but we have treatments for that . Thanks . Do you use Flash-Crete solvent ? On the face ? No , never . The solvent is a derivative of my hand dip . The active ingredient in both is limonene , it 's excellent for purifying the skin . Were Zoe 's hands dipped in the limonene ? Yes , of course . It 's part of the Shangri-La experience . Zimmer , Thurgood , and the crew all used the limonene solvent at the site . All right , we 're going to need a sample of that . Now ! Okay , um ... Here . Thank you . Thanks . Allison , hey , um , please tell me you have some good news . Limonene was the bio-activation agent we were looking for . I 'm sensing a " but " in there somewhere . The antidote needs to be absorbed directly into the skin . So put it in a cream and slather it on . The petrification process has closed off Zoe 's pores . So we have a cure but no way to deliver it ? Not yet . Okay ? All this technology and no way to give her the cure . Yeah , but she 's still breathing . Can 't she just inhale it ? No , the cure must be directly applied to the skin . But petrified tissue is porous on a microscopic level . If we could just take advantage of that somehow . Vicelli said that her molecular steam penetrates all skin types . Molecular steam might be small enough to penetrate . And if we aerosolize the cure , Vicelli might be able to deliver it . That 's it . Hurry , come on , Jo . Okay , hang on , Zo . We 're going to help you . Okay . That 's it , the system 's ready . Okay . Here we go . Initiating steam . Ten percent absorption . Fifty percent absorption . Eighty percent absorption . How can we tell if it 's working ? We 'll know soon enough . Come on . Nothing 's happening . We tried everything we could . Jack , I 'm so sorry . No . No . No . Come on , come on . Come on . Come on . Come on . I 'm here . I got you back . Hey . Hi . Oh , wow . Petrification does awesome things for your skin . Too bad about the whole almost dying part . Yeah . It was almost , right ? Derek ... Yeah , yeah , he 's fine . And the others , too . It 's quite a homecoming , huh ? It sure wasn 't dull . No . How we doing ? Well , I 'm not garden statuary anymore . Well , that 's a good start . We 're going to keep you here for another day , just as a precaution . And don 't even think about arguing . Hey , if it avoids being grilled about my love life , I 'm all for it . Uh , don 't count on it . I 'll be right back . I don 't know how to thank you . I 'm just happy everything worked out okay . Well , I wouldn 't say all okay . What 's Zane doing here ? Apparently , he and Zoe are friendly . Since when ? Since we changed stuff . Oh , could this get any worse ? Hey , how 's our girl ? Uh , she 's good . Yeah ? I 'm going to be sick . Come on . Oh , God . She asked my advice about her new guy . Her new guy is my old guy . I know , I know , you must be really upset and you probably want to kill them . In normal circumstances , I 'd help you . Okay , but you 're not okay with this ? No , no , I 'm not okay with this . And I keep telling myself that it 's a crush and that it 's not going to last . What if it does ? I got to go . Okay . Henry , listen . About lunch today ... What is going on ? You blinded me with science ! So romantic ! So , Zoe 's on her way to a full recovery . Well , thanks to you . Well , it was a team effort . Well ... You know , Zoe said that what starts in the friend zone should just stay in the friend zone . Do you think that that 's right ? I think that good friends are hard to find . So you think the kiss was a mistake ? No . I think that what we have , it 's really special . And if things didn 't work out between us , especially after everything we 've been through ... What I 'm trying to say is ... Maybe ... Maybe it 's not worth the risk . Okay . Trevor Grant ? How do you know my name ? I 've known your name my whole life . I believe you knew my father , Adam , back in 1947 . Who are you ? My name is Beverly Barlowe and we 've been waiting a very long time for you .

 ( BIRDSONG ) ( BRAKES SQUEAK ) DIANE : It 's a comic ? BECKY : No , it 's a graphic novel . It 's called The Utopia Experiments . You had this . Where is it ? If just one of those conspiracy theories was proved. just one ... - What about Utopia , then ? - Oh , tell him , Becky . Utopia Part Two , there must be something in it that they want . I also live with my mum . Jesus Christ ! You 're going to make me cry now , Ian . My mission ? You should persuade him to take it . What about the vaccine ? Russian flu . I think we could reconsider . He signed . BEV : He 's fucking resigning , Michael . My mate 's going to ask you a question . - ( GASPING ) - Where is Jessica Hyde ? ( GASPS ) My name is Jessica Hyde . Come with me now or you 'll. all die . Who are you ? And what 's going on ? Ian , don 't point that gun at me . How ... how do you know my name ? Jessica Hyde . JESSICA : Wilson ? They did this . We all have to go now . We 're not going anywhere until you tell us who you are , how you know my name and what the fuck is going on . Ian , you won 't be able to shoot me . Yeah ? Don 't imagine I won 't , Jess . No , really , you won 't be able to shoot me . You 've got the safety catch on . They don 't generally have safety catches . Except on telly . Every second we stay here is a second they are getting closer , and they 'll kill us all . Please , come with me . What about my dad ? He 's going home . I 've arranged for someone to pick up your dad from where he works . You don 't know where he works . Davington 's on Vesta Road . They 're picking him up now . I promise . I 'm not sure about this . You two ready ? Yeah , we 're ready . There 's CCTV at both ends of your street . We 'll go through the back . ( ALL STRAIN ) BECKY : OK , stay there . IAN : What if someone 's in ? ( TELEVISION PLAYS ) ( BABY CRIES ) ( GURGLING ) ( BABY CHATTERS ) ( BABY CHATTERS ) ( BABY CHATTERS AND GIGGLES ) ( CHATTERS ) NEWSREADER : ... social unrest if prices continue to rise . The Shadow Home Secretary has suggested the Government 's apparent lack of planning could lead to outbreaks of violence ... ( GURGLES ) ( CAR LOCKING SYSTEM BEEPS ) Is this your car ? You 're so cute . ( STARTS ENGINE ) IAN : Are you going to tell us what 's going on ? Who 's after us ? In the 1970s , the Soviets set up a germ-warfare programme called Biopreparat . It was huge . They were weaponising anthrax , Ebola , smallpox , on a massive scale . The West panicked and created an organisation to combat the threat . It was known as The Network . It was based in no country , reported to no-one , and was utterly deniable . It did things democratic governments couldn 't . They were insane , totally out of control . IAN : What 's that got to do with us ? Basically , that 's who 's after you . You 're fucking joking , right ? ( BIRDSONG ) ( LABOURED BREATHING ) ( MOBILE RINGS ) Right . Do you know where that is yet ? No . I 'll come there anyway . Give me the gun . We need clothes and money . Your accounts are useless now . What , you 're going to rob them ? Let me make this very clear . Your lives as you knew them are over . What the next 48 hours are about is abandoning everything you knew or thought you could rely on , and adjusting to the new reality . If you can adjust , you will live . If you can 't , you will die . Now , we need to change the way you look . We need to get very far away , and we need drugs for Wilson . Give me the gun . Ian , hang on , c-can we talk about this ? I mean , it 's an armed robbery . It 's adjust or die , Ian . I don 't know what to think of her . You could have fooled me . Oh , you 've got to be fucking kidding me . What , you just going to watch , are you ? Here . Diamorphine . What , heroin ? It 's a painkiller . It 'll do for now . You look good . Should wear that colour more often . You look shit . But in a good way . We need to get out of the city . We 'll transfer to a van to keep Wilson out of sight , then burn this out . ( SEAGULLS CRY ) Do you have the manuscript , Ian ? Utopia Part Two . You need to tell me if you have it . We don 't . Bejan never turned up . I haven 't got Wilson 's father . I need to do things to keep us alive . Some of those things you wouldn 't normally approve of . This is insane . Yesterday I was arrested for a sex crime , today I 'm on the run from ex-government nutters who want to pull out my eyes . I 'm a fucking IT consultant . - Geoff ? Geoff . - Hmm ? Have you seen this ? ( LAUGHS ) Yeah . Those bastards have got a real bee in their bonnet about the bloody vaccine . But they 've named me . Well , you did buy it , Michael . And in any case , there 's nothing we can do about it . We 're tied into the contract . Yeah , well ... Well , we 're not , actually . I 've found a cancellation clause . It can be enacted if the department 's total spend with the supplier is over 240 million . It 's to ensure diversity of supply . Yeah , but this is only 83 million , Michael , I mean , really , it 's ... No , no , but it 's total spend . We get two other vaccines from Corvadt . Plus a wide range of antibiotics , cytotoxics , hypoglycaemics ... I mean , this puts us well over 240 mil . Have the contracts sent over to me immediately . No-one else to see them . Look , whatever Corvadt are paying you , we are not going to get away with it . We can stop all this . We can stop it all now . It 's horrendous , trying to conceive , isn 't it ? The medical nature of it all , the IVF , all that science . A man needs warmth . So I understand you fucking a prostitute , I do . But what I don 't understand is you getting her pregnant . Do you think your wife will understand ? Now , get the contract straight over to me now . It 's for the best . ( BUZZING ) ( BIRDS CAW ) Ian and I are going up ahead . Great ! Have fun . IAN : Where are we going ? I hack airline companies , look for people going on holiday , stay at their houses . They never know . This is connected to a trip wire in the drive . Have everything by the back door , always be ready to leave within 60 seconds . What if you 're in the bath ? No baths , no showers . It 's time to stop worrying about looking pretty , Becky . Are you trying to wind me up ? There 'd be no value to that that I can see . You got a thing for tough women , is it ? Oh , don 't worry , Ian . I get it . Imagine her big , strong arms around you . What ? You let us walk into this . I mean , how much did you know ? Because we had no idea . Look at Wilson 's face . That 's not my fault ! Tell that to his dad . Because she doesn 't have him , by the way . Right , tell us the truth . All of it . Not bits and pieces - all . Or I leave . Would you like to at least sit down first , Becky ? No , Jessica , I fucking wouldn 't . The Network was created by two men . A geneticist called Philip Carvel , and someone called Mr Rabbit ... " Mr Rabbit " ? It 's a code name , no-one knows the real identity . When the Cold War began to wind down , the various governments involved decided to back away . Only thing was , Mr Rabbit and Carvel had no intention of stopping . At some point , Carvel wanted out . So they tortured him to keep him working and held his daughter hostage . Eventually , his mind snapped and ... he went mad . He was going be got rid of but somehow he was smuggled out , given a new name , and hidden in a psychiatric hospital . The hospital was Shenley . And the new name was Mark Dane . What , you ... You mean Carvel wrote Utopia ? A therapist got him drawing . What he drew was incredible . So all the things in Utopia are real ? Like ... BSE . They created that ? It 's hard to say what 's real and what 's not . But , yeah BSE was theirs . IAN : How do you know all this ? I 'm Philip Carvel 's daughter . I was smuggled out with him when I was four . I 've been on the run ever since . Did you pricks give me heroin ? We had to . For the pain . Oh . Well , I hope it wasn 't Afghan . Taliban have been altering it for years to make us infertile . Everyone knows that . ( BIRDS CHIRP ) Sssh . We need to find Utopia . We start with where it came from . What ? What about the others ? It 's fine . I left a note . " Back soon , don 't have a bath . " Look , Wilson needs someone to look after ... That is not the reason ! Don 't you see what she 's doing ? She 's trying to divide us ! Becky , that makes no sense . - Then why take you and not me ? - Because you 're not strong enough . I can 't risk taking you . I know stuff . I know more than he does . Like , what about Corvadt ? They 're involved , they gave people disease . What about Corvadt ? They 're involved - so what ? They 're a bit player . You 're not ready , Becky . - Look , you just need time to ... - Right , go on , then . Fuck off ! ( DOOR SHUTS ) ( MOBILE CHIMES ) What 's that ? Oh , it 's nothing . - It 's work . - ( SHE SIGHS ) Don 't worry . ANYA : I very scared . I-I know , I-I mean ... They find out I pregnant . They angry . Well , you just have to give me some time . Michael , I think I watched . Watched ? By who ? I don 't know . I scared that they come now . Michael , you help , yes ? You good man , yes ? Michael Dugdale ? My name 's William Kaye , I 'm a journalist . I wanted to talk about the flu vaccine . No , no , I 'm sorry ... Listen to me ! Your life is in danger . This isn 't about a fucking story ! If I just wanted a story , I 'd report the fact that you 've got a Russian prostitute pregnant . There 's my card . Things are going to get mad . You 'll need me when they do . JESSICA : Bejan got Utopia from the comic shop . They got it from a dealer in Scotland who is now dead . And he got it from this guy - Jack Tate . KAN : And who 's Jack Tate ? The man who published Utopia . ( RINGS DOORBELL ) Mrs Tate ? Yes ? We need to speak to your husband . Right . My ... husband 's dead . Do you want to come in ? This was his study . Can you tell us where he died ? Er ... The A22 under the Hailsham Bridge . He walked out in front of a lorry . I 'm sorry . Do you miss him ? Of course I miss him . Actually , I have something you might be interested in . Yeah , it 's a ... thing - I can 't describe it - papers and drawings . That sounds like exactly the sort of thing we 're looking for . We have to get out of here now . What ? Why ? Yes , you might want these papers ... What the fuck have you done ? ! - She 's with them . - What ? What are you talking about ? Police turn up asking to see your dead husband and you don 't ask why ? Ah , shit . Glock 22 . She 's CIA . It means she knows next to fucking nothing . That 's how they work . They have people high up who get their drones to do their work for them . ( MUFFLED SCREAMING ) ( WHIMPERS ) You 're going to answer my questions . And if I think you 've told me even one lie I 'll put this wire in the water plug this in , flip the switch . Understand ? Why are you here ? ( AMERICAN ACCENT ) We got a tip-off . The man who lived here has been wanted on terrorism charges for ... over 25 years . But we were too late . He 'd already killed himself , so ... so we took his wife in . Has the wife given you any information ? I don 't know . ( WHIMPERS ) What did she say when you got here ? On the day he died , he was talking crazy , he wasn 't making any sense , he said he 'd been visited by a tramp ... A tramp ? A tramp or The Tramp ? I don 't know . " The " , maybe , or ... Look , hang on ... I asked you a question . Was it a tramp ... or The Tramp ? " The " . It was " The " , definitely " The " . She said " The " . - A select committee ? - Yes . With powers to look into all aspects of the acquisition process . This is not going away , Geoff . They 're announcing it tomorrow . Do nothing . Keep quiet . The morning will bring something new . It always does . Geoff , we cannot do nothing ! Well , it 's sort of an order , actually . Worry less . Look , I know it 's scary now . But tomorrow , you 'll be a hero . I promise . ( BIRDS CHIRP ) You didn 't call in . We were worried . You 're not Agency . Who are you ? No . I 'm not Agency . I 'm a specialist . What did you tell them ? What did I tell ' em ? They were going to fucking fry me - what do you think I told them ? I told them everything I knew . Was it her ? Yeah . Yeah , it was her . She was with a young black male , 25 , 28 . Was a young man there ? Messed-up face , missing an eye ? Er No . No , just ... them . Look , are you going to untie me ? Wow . That looks great ! It 's like , um ... pirate chic . ( SHE CHUCKLES ) How 's your sight ? Er ... I can see shapes and colours . Thanks for looking after me , Becky . Where 's my dad ? She lied . She had to get us out , Wilson . I mean , she ... He 's probably fine . I need to find out . We can 't . You know they 'll be monitoring our families , we 'll put them in danger ... Look online . I 'll show you how to disguise the search . I swear they won 't know it came from here . - Wilson , we can 't . - I need to know . Please . His name 's Milton . Milton ? Milton Wilson ? What is it with your family and names ? Right , you 're sure they can 't trace this ? Positive . He 's a cricket nut , he logs in every day . You 'll see whether or not he 's logged in . Is he there ? Hang on , I 'm not in yet . Is he there ? Er ... yeah . ( SIGHS WITH RELIEF ) Yeah , yeah , he 's there , he 's fine . Grant has the manuscript . I heard them talking about it , and they mentioned him . I weren 't going to fucking tell her . ( CHILDREN CHATTER AND LAUGH ) Who are you , then ? I 'm Alice . What are you doing ? - You 're not from this school . - Fuck off before you get hurt ! I 'm not scared of you ! What 's that ? - Comic . - Well ? Are you going to show me or are you going to be a twat all day ? Going to tell me your name , then , twat ? Grant . Pleased to meet you , Grant . Alice . ( BELL RINGS ) ALICE : Shit ! Don 't go . Same time tomorrow , twat . Are you sure this 'll work ? Fanaticomix ? Grant 's addicted to it . It 's nerd heaven . And you have to read all the personals , otherwise you miss all the good stuff . I don 't . Other people do . But what if they 're monitoring it ? Say to meet at the Embassy . Dane based the Embassy on the Taunton Building on the Kame Hill Estate . Only a real twat would know that . And me . Never deny your inner twat , Wilson . It 's part of your charm . Oh . 20 ... And then 6 plus something = 20 . ALICE 'S MUM : Don 't forget to brush . ALICE : I won 't . Good night , Mummy . - Sleep tight , darling . - Love you . What are you doing ? Can I sleep on your floor ? I won 't do nothing , I promise . Have you got that comic ? This is so beautiful . Yeah . And that 's part two . No-one 's ever seen that - just you and me . You 're quite surprising , you know . You strike me more as a Spider-Man type . Oh , we should sleep . If my mum sees a light , she 'll come in . Twat . Thanks for letting me read Utopia . Just to look after , like . Keep it under your bed . I 'll ... I 'll ... I-I 'll come back . For that . Oh . Didn 't they come back last night ? Nope . Wankers . What we going to do ? I know what I 'm going to do . I 'm going to have a fucking bath . NEWSREADER : We 're getting more information on our breaking news story - the outbreak of flu in the Shetland Islands . We can confirm two more people have now died , bringing the death toll to 11 . That 's 11 now dead on the Shetland island of Fetlar from the suspected outbreak of Russian flu . - ( CAFETIERE CRASH ES ) - Shit ! 18 dead , 33 infected . There 's only 86 on the island . Geoff 's ordered a quarantine . No-one gets in or out . Right . Er ... Right . If it 's a new strain , it 's got infection rates already of 58 % . Michael , thank God you got the vaccine . You 're a fucking hero . Did you tell them my name ? Did you tell them my fucking name ? No , no , I didn 't say anything . I think they 're on to me . I think I 'm being followed . I mean , I ... I saw two men . Jesus Christ ! Have you seen the news ? It 's happening . I told you . What do I do ? I mean , people are dying ! We need a sample of the vaccine . You can request one direct from Corvadt . It 's within your remit as an advisor . There 's a man in Sheffield , a scientist called Donaldson - get it to him . What about you ? ( GLASS SMASHES ) Do exactly as I fucking say ! The Tramp used to be a scientist with The Network . He got out . Now he monitors their activities . He has to keep under the radar to stay alive . I reckon that 's his office . A public phone ? Here we go . Him ? But ... He really is a tramp ? ( LAUGHS ) Yeah . He 's called The Tramp , Ian . Hello , Danny . IAN : Oh , shit ! Oh ! Fucking hell ! You nearly broke my nose . You nearly broke my fucking nose ! Jessica , how lovely . How did you know Utopia had a part two ? He 's on our side , isn 't he ? There are no sides . Just people who help you and people who don 't . Now , now , Jess , you know a gentleman - never reveals his ... - Don 't make me ask you again , Danny . Jack told me years ago . I went to see him now because I wanted part two . - I knew Jack from the old days , you see . - Why ? What 's in it ? He never told me , and when your father died , well , it didn 't matter any more . But now they have something . Your father was working on a project called Janus before he died . They 've replicated his research . They have it . They 're going to test it . IAN : And ... and what does Janus do ? I swear I don 't know . The last thing your father was working on were viral delivery vectors that attack the human genome . And Tate ? What did he say ? He said that this is the end . He said that we are all finished . And he took his own life . We need to work together , Jess , you and I ... What I still don 't get is what you were going to do with it . I mean , what use would it be to a decrepit old sack of filth like you ? What do you think your last breath will feel like , Danny ? There 's a woman , MI5 ... They already have MI5 . Not this one . She 's like us - works in secret , trusts no-one . She can help . Now , Jess , if you get me the manuscript , I can get it to her . What 's her name ? Please don 't make me tell you that , Jessica . Milner . Her name 's Milner . She 's a good woman , Jessica . Ian , we need a vehicle . You 've seen me enough times . It 's time for you to do it . Why didn 't he give it to you ? Bit odd . I 'm on your side , Jessica , you know that . I 'm one of the ... ( HE GRUNTS ) ( CHOKING ) ( CHOKING ) ( SHE BREATHES DEEPLY ) If we found him , they would . He gave up Milner 's name like that . You saw what they did to Wilson . So you just killed him ? - I pulled up the ladder . - What ? You fucking killed him ! You took his life ! So , what , you just kill people if they 're not convenient , is that it ? Why are you being so odd ? What the fuck are you doing ? They ... er ... They just came in . So you tied them up ? Children ? You tied up children ? We 're making it look like a burglary ! You did the right thing . We meet here tomorrow , 10pm . Keep Wilson out of sight . Stay on country roads , avoid CCTV . You did exactly the right thing . So I-I-I ... I want a sample of the vaccine . I-I-I 'm sure you understand , with the events of last night . So this is an R6 80 request for ... Excellent , yes . You want a sample . Yes , it 's ... it 's all filled . It 's all in order . - The ... er ... paperwork is ... - What do you want it for ? You are contractually obliged to supply a sample within 48 hours . Yes , of course . Something wrong ? No , no , nothing 's wrong . I just need ... - I want a sample . I can do that . - ( TURNS UP TELEVISION ) NEWSREADER : Freelance journalist William Kaye has been murdered in a car park in Wapping in East London in what is being described by police as a gangland-style execution .

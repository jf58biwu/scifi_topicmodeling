 Agent . ♪ ♪ Excuse me . She 's got next shift . You guys keep taking my girls , you 're gonna put me out of business . Get a new girl . You seem to be quite ... agitated . What are you doing , Agent ? He 's a native . My jurisdiction . Sorry he acted out , Captain Windmark . I mean , you could wipe him , sure , but then there 's the inquiry , the paperwork . Club gets shut for two days , and I , for one , lose a hell of a lot of kickbacks . I must say , Agent , you are always exactly what you seem . Can you stand ? Go home , Kitty . Take the rest of the night off . Thanks , Rick . What are you ? Stupid ? What can I say ? I 'm a gentleman . I had to piss him off so he 'd try and wipe me . Otherwise he would have read me . But he read you . And you fooled him . How the hell did you do that ? Just lucky , I guess . Lucky ? They find out about you , they 'll kill you . Hell , they find out there 's anyone like you , they 'll probably kill us all . I love being special . You 're late . I said 6 : 00 . It 's 8 : 00 . They added two new checkpoints downtown . You said " important . " Oh , baby ... You don 't know the half of it . Remember all those times I said you were nuts ? Looks like I was wrong . Go ahead . Does anyone else know about this ? No , of course not . Oh , my God . - Where are the others ? Were they- - - Yeah . Two more . Man and a woman . Younger . Right where I found this one . Heat was rising . - Couldn 't move ' em all at once . - Where ? The city . Inside the old- - Attention , curfew is now in effect . Natives , please return to your homes immediately . ♪ Fringe 4x19 ♪ Letters of Transit Original Air Date on April 20 , 2012 = = sync , corrected by elderman = = ♪ Who are you ? Loyalists hung a few resistance fighters from Copley Plaza mall . We need to cut them down . We have two containment breaches in Back Bay . And curfews- - people are getting brave . Don 't let them . - Where the hell have you been , Agent ? - Sir , I need- - Walk with me . Now . - Late . - I know . - Very . - Sorry . Very . I need a coffee . I could use some air myself . I remember when you used to be able to drink this stuff . You are old . So what 's wrong ? - Rick 's dead . - What ? - Loyalist killed him . - Damn it , Etta . Black market tech gets people killed . Even cops . Black market tech replaced your eyes . I don 't need a history lesson . You were gonna stop running civilians . I had an open order with him . From the old days . I just never cancelled it . An order for what ? Any info on the missing team . Really ? Again ? You 've got to let this go . - Simon- - - It 's a myth , Etta . The original Fringe team didn 't vanish . They aren 't missing . They died 20 years ago . They aren 't coming back to save us from the Observers . They aren 't in the desert or Peru , or immortal . You 're right . They 're in Amber . And I 've got one of them right here . Well , I 'll be a toe on a foot in a grave . That 's the Amber device . He did this on purpose . What could have been so terrible that he ambered himself ? And his team . Rick said the others were with him . Once we get Dr. Bishop out , he can tell us where they are . Let 's not get ahead of ourselves yet . Agent . - No , thank you . - Don 't be rude , Phillip . Have a drink with me . It 's water . It doesn 't do anything for me . It hydrates you . Yes , I suppose it does . As much as I would have enjoyed eliminating him myself , native-on-native killing cannot stand . Not on my watch . I heard . And , no , we don 't have any leads . This is the fourth this month . I can count . I like you , Philip . But be assured ... Bite my hand and I will put you down . Your division is in charge of native crime . Or would you rather I was in charge of native crime ? I don 't think you 'd like my methods . I 'll get you a suspect . Good . Windmark . What did you do up there in the future ... to get yourself such a crap detail ? I like animals . Third generation Amber . No reverse protocols . Durable stuff , this . There 's no way to revert it to its gaseous form ? I didn 't say that . Oh , dear . Good look on you . It looks like the Amber can only be reverted to its gaseous state momentarily . He won 't have enough time to emerge safely . By the time he 's aware enough to step out of it ... the gas will have resolidified , capturing him again . Couldn 't we just push him out ? Not unless you want to end up encased in that stuff yourself . Hey . Hey . What 's it for ? Hell if I know . You know Simon . You know ... not everyone trusts Simon . - My friends- - - Your friends in the city ? Some think he 's allowed the resistance to operate a little ... too freely . He had better have a good reason for checking out old level-two tech . 'Cause my friends- - in the city . They 're gonna be watching . A girl like you might want to watch her " P " s and " Q " s . Wouldn 't want to do the wrong thing . I 'll keep that in mind . Fire in the hole . Wow . Crowd control- - back before the loyalists decided it was easier just to use bullets . I 'm quite proud of these little babies . When I say . Really ? I was gonna go before . Okay , buffers are communicating . Ready ? Three , two , one . I didn 't say " now . " You were late ! Dr. Bishop , my name is Agent Simon Foster . It is a great honor for me to meet you , sir . And you , young lady , you 're very pretty . Etta . We just removed you from Amber , Dr. Bishop . You were inside 20 years . 20 years ? It 's no wonder I 'm so hungry . Do you have anything to eat ? This was- - is your favorite food . That 's what they say . The stories , I mean . Mmm ! Mmm ! Mmm ! That 's lovely , thank you . Our records indicate that , after the invasion , you and your team discovered a way of getting rid of the Observers . These are the blueprints for the device you were working on . But we believe , before you could finish it , you and your team were- - were you all caught in Amber ? - What do you call it ? - We don 't know . We--we thought it was some kind of beacon . No , no , no , you silly Billy--this . The same as you . We call it licorice . Licorice . Licorice . Li-cor-ice . Who are you ? You 're quite pretty . Li-cor-ice . Do you have ring-dings ? Dr. Bishop , I need you to try and stay perfectly still . Walter . Yes , I hear you , Peter . I will try not to move . Here , try this . His neuropathways have degraded . It looks as if he 's experienced some sort of trauma . Probably because he was so close to the blast horizon of the Amber . Brain damage . Mmm . Well , how do we fix him ? I don 't know . She 'll be here in a moment . Your meeting . It 's about to take place . You wanted to see me , Agent . Yes , ma 'am . We 're still waiting on the touch screens for headquarters . They 've been back-ordered now for six months . Well , I don 't know how to break this to you , Agent , but your department 's needs are the lowest thing on my list of priorities . I understand that it 's- - perhaps even lower . And how is it that you always manage to come during my lunch hour ? Walk me to my car . I 'm sorry . I can 't hide my thoughts from them the same way that you can . Have you made any progress with Walter 's device ? Well , yes and no . And the others . Are they- - unclear . If Dr. Bishop knows where they are , he 's unable to tell us . And why not ? - Do I know you ? - Yes , Walter . It 's Nina . Nina Sharp . We 've known each other for many years . It 's good to see you again . In that case , it 's good to see you too . So what do you think , Ms. Sharp ? Can you help fix him ? Of course , you understand the risks of wanting to save the world ? Well , they say he did it once before . He and his team . Yes , they did . But not without great consequence . I can 't fix him . But I have an idea . Massive Dynamic has long had a piece of Walter 's brain that was surgically removed and kept in a locked vault . It 's entirely possible that you could use that material to inspire Walter 's brain to heal itself . They removed a piece of his brain ? William Bell did . It was at Walter 's request . Why ? I don 't think he liked the person he was becoming . So can you go get it and bring it out here ? Well , no , it 's not as simple as that . The old brain tissue is very fragile . Neural matter can decay in seconds . You can 't just carry it around in a petri dish . Why do I feel ... like you 're trying to bury the lead ? The material isn 't here . It 's still at our old facility . In the city . That 's wall-to-wall Observers . We 've done harder . No , we haven 't . - You really should get this fixed . - Hmm . All right , Simon . Walter , stop it . No , we 've just been catching up . Yes . No , he 'll be ready when you get here . Walter , Etta and Simon got the transit passes . What on earth are you doing ? Try it . Wh- - Oh . I hope we 're going to the circus . Walter . Snacks . Do you think they 'd have any of that delicious lic- - Monster . Shh . It 's okay . - Monster ! - We got to get him off the street . - Hold up there . What seems to be the matter ? Fringe Agents . No matter . - We 're just heading downtown . - I see . I trust you have papers . Of course . What 's your name , prisoner ? Prisoner ? I most certainly am not . Look at me ! Do I look like- - He 's--he 's not a prisoner . He 's her grandfather . We 're taking him to visit my grandmother 's grave . Today 's the anniversary of her death . " I am not a number . I am a free man . " As you can see , He 's crazy . We just checked him out of the home for the day . But it was last minute , and we didn 't have time to do the proper paperwork . " These aren 't the ' droids you 're looking for . " I 'm sorry . I 'm sure you can understand . Next time , I won 't be so nice . - Thank you . - " Move along . " Nice . - You okay ? - Yes . Wonderful . It 's quite the adventure , isn 't it ? Yeah , I suppose it is . Like The Guns of Navarone . Deja vu . What ? I feel like I 've been here before . You have . Man times , I imagine . Though that was a long time ago . I hope it was cleaner then . Dust is revolting . Sir , there 's been a break-in at the old Massive Dynamic . - Massive Dynamic ? - Yes , sir . Underground parking garage . Are we sure it isn 't a fault in the system ? - It 's been buggy lately . - I ran diagnostics . It 's not a false alarm . This is Agent Broyles . I need to talk to Captain Windmark . How 's it look ? I can 't say . I have no idea how it 's supposed to look . What is that ? Monkey feces ? That , Dr. Bishop , is your brain . We need an inactive medium to transfer the neural tissue . A mixture of saline and polysorbate 80 . Three CCs of each . Have you seen it ? Monkey feces ? No . I can 't say I 've had the pleasure . I wouldn 't say that it was a pleasure . First , I need you to take these pills . They 're Diazepam , mostly . They 'll put you into a deep sleep , for ten minutes , that will quiet your brain to allow the process to occur faster . You 're a clever boy . Dare I ask ? Synthetic neurotrophins . Growth proteins . If this process works , it should allow his brain to absorb the missing tissue in a matter of minutes . I 've eaten it once . It was sweeter than you 'd think . Feces ? God , no . Brains . And LSD . I love LSD . Ready . Dr. Bishop , we 're going to inject that solution into the base of your brain . Oh , fun . What was your name , again ? - Simon . - Simon . Like in the game " Simon Says . " I 'm going to have to listen to you . Isn 't that right , young lady ? Yes , he 's a very smart boy . Okay , this may look scary , but- - I suddenly feel very tired , Simon . Here . Simon says , " Go to sleep now , Walter . " What if this doesn 't work ? Dr. Bishop ? It has to . When I was in my freshman year at college- - I 'm at Stanford . And in the middle of the night , my roommate comes banging on my door . Tells me to wake up , come check out the TV . I tell him to go away . I ... I have a girl in my bed . But he won 't take no for an answer . So me and the girl ... Emily ... We get dressed , go to the common room . On the TV they 're showing footage from ... Chicago , L.A ... London . Observers going from house to house and ... dragging people out into the street . That was 2015 . The Purge . I 'm watching people ... Being dragged from their homes , led into the street , and being ... put down like dogs . And suddenly ... I knew . I don 't know how , but ... I knew . That 's ... why my parents sent me so far away for school . They were part of the resistance . They- - they sent me away to protect me . That was the night they were killed . And that was the night ... I knew I wouldn 't give up ... until the Observers had gone . You never told me that . I never told anyone that . I was only four the last time I saw my parents . I can 't even picture their faces anymore . Dr. Bishop ? Are you okay ? I believe that 's mine , young man . Agent Simon Foster . Fringe Division . Pleased to meet you , sir . - What year is it ? - 2036 . And they 're still here ? The Observers ? Assessment ? Sir , I count three sets of footprints . Ready weapons . Protocol ? Shoot first . I 'll read them later . Sir , 12th floor is clear . Okay , proceed to the 13th . Can you build it ? Walter ? They weren 't all bad , you know . One of them even tried to help us . He was called September . What happened to him was ... well , unexpected . He told me that , in the year 2609 A.D. , they finally ruined the planet . They poisoned it- - the air , the water . And when it was fundamentally uninhabitable , then they traveled back through time , and took our planet from us . Yes , I can build it . Okay , good . It 'll take some time . But it would be easier if you didn 't have to do it alone . Wouldn 't it ? If you had your team with you to help you ? You were trapped in Amber with them , right ? Do you remember where that was ? Do you remember where we can find the others ? You . Elevator . Did you forget to disable the internal alarms ? What are you people ? Idiots ? This way . Neither Belly or I ever left ourselves only one way out of a room . Come on . Warm . They were just here . So how 'd they get out ? Step back . Keep going ! Two lefts and a right . How do we open it ? What ? Where 's Bishop ? ♪ ♪ Walter , come on . We 've got to get out of here . They 're coming . Give me your watch . What ? - Your watch . Now . - What are you doing ? What is this ? Resistance must take place at any opportunity . We are insurgents . And this is anti-matter . You 're smart- - you do the math . What are you waiting for ? Come on ! Sir , in here . ♪ ♪ What is that ? I know where they are . Who ? The others . My team . I know where we were ambered . We should hurry . It 's not far from here . ♪ ♪ So ... Are you gonna tell me what that was all about ? Back at Massive Dynamic . You and Bishop . You see him . He 's half a fruitcake short of Christmas . Yeah . Yeah , he is . Isn 't he ? The wand should be just about powered up . I 'll check on it . And you 're certain it was Agent Foster ? Yes , Agent . Foster and a woman , and a man Foster claimed was her grandfather . But with a prisoner transport I.D. As I said , you may all play fast and loose up there in Boston , but here , rules and regulations matter . If you prefer , I can certainly take this up with downtown- - No . I can handle my agents . Agent Romick , activate Agent Foster 's tracker and assemble a team . You designed these yourself ? Augmentation buffers . Yeah . One goes on either side , down by her feet . Not bad . You know ... I think you 're just what we 've been waiting for- - someone to show people that we don 't just ... have to accept our fate ... that we can fight back , that we can use our will and our imagination to make a better world , a better life . In that case , a little more focus and a little less pontificating- - we might have the job done by now . Right . Ready ? On three . One , two , three . Ooh . Etta , the injection . - Where am I ? - You 're okay . I 'm Etta . I 'm just going to give you an injection to help you breathe , okay ? - Hello , Astro . - Walter . - Walter , where is- - This is not good . What ? I think I broke the wand . Can you fix it ? I can try . Set up the buffers and I 'll see what I can do . ♪ ♪ Shh . It 's not green . The activation light- - it 's red . No , actually , it 's going back and forth . Simon , something 's wrong . The buffers are having trouble communicating with each other . That doesn 't make any sense . There 's- - there 's nothing here to interfere with the signal . And no phones , no radio waves ... What is it ? My tracker . They must have activated it . We need to get him out of here . But how would they know it 's us ? I don 't know . But they know we 're here . There must be enough of a signal down here to trigger the Amber . Okay , but even so , the wand is broken . - How do we get him out of there ? - I don 't know . I hear sirens . We have to leave . We have to get him out of there now . Okay , I have an idea . Here , take this . When I say " now " ... trigger the Amber . But- - three ... Two ... One . We need him . Simon- - do it . Now .

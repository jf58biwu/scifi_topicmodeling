 APOLLO 18 JULY 20 , 1969 - APOLLO 11 ASTRONAUT NEIL ARMSTRONG IS THE FIRST MAN TO WALK ON THE MOON IN 1970 APOLLO MISSIONS 18 , 19 , 20 WERE CANCELLED DUE TO BUDGETARY CONCERNS 7 DECEMBER , 1972 - APOLLO 17 THE FINAL OFFICIAL LUNAR LANDS ON THE MOON IN 2011 , 84 HOURS OF CLASSIFIED FOOTAGE THIS FILM WAS EDITED FROM THAT FOOTAGE This 's a lot of at stake here , you know . Talking , nation versus nation . The race 's still on . It 's a lot to discover up there . I guess the call came in on a Friday . They 've never been to a barbecue . JOHN GREY COMMAND MODULE PILOT Just few beers you know , or more than a few . Could Vince 's cooking , he definitely need few . Nate took the call from Milton . And Milton said , " Eighteen is back on " But it was classified D.O.D. , top secret . Asked him " are you OK with that ? And it was like " are you kidding me ? " I come from a family military pilots . Duty can sometimes pound on private life . Make choices . Keep going forward . NASA already has like 800 pounds rocks . Nathan Walker ; Mission Commander So why we need more , I don 't know , ... but , hey , if it means a trip to the moon . Placing cameras , we have these Westinghouses all over the place . Well , I think the way it 's been explained is they 're using a Saturn 5 to launch classified D.O.D payload . ... which 's meant to be very large very heavy and apparently unmanned . Apparently . Placing these high frequency transmitters because really warning anti-missile defense system of Soviyet Union . These PSD 5 are kind of like high-tech radar scanners . They should pick up and track anything we can 't . To keep an eye on the Russian 's air . It would be nice to tell my wife . Benjamin Andersen-Lunar Module Pilot Or been by my side whole time and then . She thinks I 'm doing training exercise with the Japanese space agency . Brian , my boy , it would be nice to tell him his father 's going to the moon . I 'd love brought to him a souvenir . Maybe , a moonrock . I don 't know , may be one day . Ben was always the first in his class . And I was always running at his heels . I mean , I 'm jealous that he will walk on the moon with Nate while I 'm alone in an orbit flight . My job is essentially to make sure I 'm bringing us home safely . Look , let 's face it . These missions are result-oriented . And we can 't afford the failure you know , can we ? Things can go wrong ... things to go wrong happen . These things you 're gonna push them out of your mind . It 's just not an option . I 'm proud to do for these guys , and proud to do for my country . Ten , nine , eight ... seven , six , five ... four , three , two , one . Apollo 18 , it looks good . Christmas lights . - Bring the Christmas lights back ? - I don 't know . Not me . - Have you seen anything like that before ? - No , sorry . It 's amazing . The earth in all her glory . There is a good-looking boy . You sure he 's yours ? Watch it . He 's a good kid . It has a large space to fill . Play on Moon Boots . Nate , you 've waited all this time to put your foot on the moon and you need to be number 13 . How do you feel about that ? Are you gonna be OK with staying behind John ? Oh , you know , would be nice to have some alone times here . It 's crowded in here . I keep a light on for you boys . Don 't stay out until late . - In a couple days . - Roger that . See you in a couple days . Houston , this is Freedom . We 're preparing to unboard the Liberty.Over. OK , 18. you can go front dock in four minutes . John , is the tunnel vented ? Roger that . The tunnel is vented . OK , we are ready . We 'll send you an updated state background on that . Roger Houston . We 're coding the data . The computer is all yours . I wish you come with us , John . - Now , you be careful down there . - Don 't worry about it - Got a good visual around here - OK , 18 . You 're ready for that . We go to the moon . 1400 feet . 44 down . OK , good . Down to 1000 feet . 54 LPD . 20 feet down . Repeat , 20 feet down . OK , good . Mission Elapsed Time : Four days , 6 hours and 33 minutes . Roger . Here we are . Take it down . - Carefull with the line . Over . - Where ? After that next crater . 4 o 'clock . It seems pretty rocky area . Mark it . 430 feet . Down 15 . Houston , we have a program alarm 1201 . - You have go to 1201 Liberty . - Roger . Go to 1201 . Do you want to take about reversing that approach ? Negative . We miss the window . The moon isn 't ... - We 're closing now . Three , two , one . - How does it look ? - We 're coming in too fast . - Try to stabilize . Negative Houston . The range is long . We go to manual . - Contact Light . - Standby everyone . Stay . No stay . Stay where you are Liberty . Houston , give that man a cigar . - Looks great . - Excellent landing . You talking to me or to Nate ? I 'm talking you both , kid . 25 December , 1974 . EMD ... 4 days nine hours , 23 minutes . Commander , Nathan Walker . Ministry of Defense , Mission Report 1A . For day one of our two-day mission ... This is Thomas Young of Apollo Mission Control . - Managed to move our 16 mm cameras . - Copy . Looks like 5 reels 10,000 feet Kodachrome . Houston , we 're prepared for OA1 . Copy Liberty . You are go for decompression chamber . But not good boys . We don 't want anyone catching cold . - Copy that . - Copy that . I look after him . Hope that the hose is long enough . Houston we take now the first step on the South Pole . I had prepared a speech but I don 't have much audiences anyway . Do not worry about it . You will have opportunity soon . There are rock formations everywhere . The sun is low on the horizon . Maybe . Freedom , do you hear ? Freedom receiving you loud and clear , Liberty . Over . Yeah , yeah , perfect . You call that a salute ? OK . Let me get a shot of you with that LEM in the background . It 's more like a naval salute . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . I got to get this . I promised Lauren and Brian Christmas to spend with them . This 's all going back to the Department of Defense . We 're placing Westinghouse cams . WESTINGHOUSE MOTION DETECTION CAMERA Sounds good , Nate . Standby . Motion cencor is tracking you perfectly , Nate Captain says that we will test the audio when you get back . I 'm checking the payload in the missile unit . What was that ? Houston , need check that panel for anything that interferences . Roger . You need to walk to procedure location 1 and initiate the procedure . Copy . We 're on our way . Hey , take a look at that . Makes you think , doesn 't it ? It 's dusty . Leave the camera here , so you get better view Tommy . It 's hard to believe that the sun never shines in some places . Careful now , fellows . If you are in any of those craters , you can call to her - PSD5 in place . - Copy that . You recorded signal frequency on the PSD5 in your training ? - It was without that , wasn 't it ? - I thought , it was . I think they have changed it . That 's the coordinates : 4.3 on Z and ... Inititating sequence is completed . If we gonna get noise from the high tech again ? Don 't worry . A good geological sample and what appears to be an impact crater . Samples feel strange . Let 's get out of here . EMD ... four days , 14 hours and 48 minutes . Commander Nathan Walker . D.o.D mission report 3C . Day 1 , DVA 1 complete . I 'm starving . What 's the menu tonight ? - Carrots or peas ? - I 'll take carrots . - Get the peas . - Perfect . I am many proud of you boys . - You have good time out there ? - You know we have . There is much noise in this frequency . See if I can isolate it . Cleared up a little bit . Copy that . Astronaut Brian Anderson , with his dad , flies through space . - Honey , what are you doing ? - Just playing mom . Don 't play with your dad 's stuff . - Is this a recording ? - I 'm sorry , Dad . I love you . Beverley is in panic because hairdresser appointment ran over . Stan and Gene already over , nothing is ready , so ... I offered to help in cutting the peppers . Couple minutes later I 'm in the bathroom taking a leak and with all these peppers in my hands ... Next thing I know , my crotch is on fire . - So , I 'm in the bathroom howling in pain . - They can not hear you . They all heard me . Stan 's wife is a nurse , so ... she sends me back into the bathroom , with a cup of milk . Hey , I guess you 're about to tell me that you have your balls in a glass of milk ? - Hey , no knock it . It works . - Jalapeno dick ! I can 't believe that you 've never heard that story ? - Beverly 's back to Miami ? - Yes . I heard that . Hear , you divorced because you snore , right ? I do not snore . Every time ! - Are you OK ? - Yes . - Bumped your head ? - Again ! It 's big head . Good night guys . Great first day . - Good night , JD . - Never should told you that , litle prick . - Nate ? - Yeah , I hear it . - What can that be here ? - Give me a second . Should be on the cam . What is that ? - Hear that ? - Yes . I don 't think it comes from here . It does not sound right . - I can 't find down here . - It 's army . You think this interference can be coming from the PSD5 ? We don 't see any obvious . We double check with the D.o.D. We 'll look into it . You go get some sleep . I am up . Turn off the noise . Good morning , Liberty . We took care of the interference a couple hours ago . It should be OK now . Do you get ready for OA2 ? EMD ... five days , 8 hours and 34 minutes . And I 'm Ben Anderson . I need to document this . Nate says he never snores in his sleep . I got proof . Hello boys , just to let you know Freedom , we 're going to around the corner to the back side . - No communication a while . - Roger that . - I 've made you breakfast . - What do I got ? - Scrambled eggs . - Again . - What do you got ? - A delicious hamsbread . It 's all yours . Just like Mom makes . Hey , did you remove one of my samples ? One of my samples is on the ground . What does that mean , Ben ? I don 't know . I bagged and tagged everything . Look , let 's go back in there giving a scoop . Oh , damn ! This one is contaminated . - I don 't understand . How did it get here ? - I don 't know . - This 's really bad . How did it get here ? - I don 't know . D.o.D 's checked around the interference with the first payload . So found diagnostics ... Houston , do you copy ? - There is no communication . - Probably get some blokage . I see some big craters . Five days , ten hours , 40 minutes since we left off . I 'm commander Nathan Walker . We are on DVA 2 . Initiating day 2 receiver cell . Activated PSD5 transmission signal to go . Houston , do you copy ? This is Liberty . Over . Still down . There 's something with that frequency . Communication can 't be down like that . - Not for this like the time . - Where are you going ? What the hell ? - Nate . - What is it ? - Tracks . - What ? That 's impossible . These are not ours . EMD ... five days , 11 hours , 7 minutes . Alan P. Anderson . Houston , this is 18 . Do you copy ? Houston , it 's 18 . Do you hear ? John is on the back side . No communication with him either . Let 's see where they lead . - Impact Crater . - Feel that ? Yeah , temperature 's dropped . Look at the footprints . It makes no sense . Like it runs in circles . Disoriented . - How should you do that ? - I don 't know . They go from this direction . Come over here . Holly shit ! - It is Russians . - What the hell ? How can be Russians on the moon and nobody know about them ? We are on the moon and nobody knows about it . Something is not right . I 'll look inside . The lights are out . Somebody 's lost it in here . Everything is crashed . Their system isn 't different from ours . The power is on . Oxygen reserve is good . I can 't tell whether they fully operational though . - Where the hell did they go ? - I don 't know . - I want to take a look around . - Stay close . Those Russians could be anywhere . What the hell ? There is blood . A lot of blood . Someone 's got hurt pretty bad . I don 't like this . I think I see something inside the crater . I 'll go down . Wait , Ben . The suits are no ready for that kind of cold . No cape . The crater is so deep . It 's so cold . I 'll see around . The ground is different . It is soft . Get out of there . Oh , my god ! It 's so cold . Get out of there . Ben ! OK , I 'm get out of here . Holy shit ! It 's a dead cosmonaut . I 'm on my way up . - Are you alright ? - Yeah , I 'm get to go . What happened here ? - Maybe the other cosmonaut ? - Do you think killed him ? - There is a crack . - What are you doing ? Get your head out of there . Wait . Something .. What the hell was that ? It 's a rock . Have it in his jacket down here . I don 't know . Let 's get out of here . We 're on the point of no turning back . If we don 't go now , we 're just as dead . - I don 't like someone has died up here . - I know . This is a secure line . I 'm just talking to you , right Tommy ? You 're just talking to me . The Russians have been to the moon . Say that again ? The Russians have landed on the South Pool . We 've found their LK Proton lander . It has not ended well for the cosmonauts . - We find the crash of the Russians ? - They didn 't crashed . - We found his body in a crater . - You found a dead cosmonaut ? Somebody didn 't know this ? We landed less than 2 clicks of the Soviets , OK ? You still believe they did not know we were here . We know they scrapped a manned flight programme in ' 69 . That was the official word . Did you know they were here ? Tommy ? This is a D.o.D mission Nate . I 'm just bringing down what I need to know . That 's all I can tell you . Say that prick from the D.o.D to give me a call . Get some rest . I get the go D.o.D over here and talk to you soon . Tommie is straight here . I knew something 's wrong from the beginning . OK , what do you think ? D.o.D 's taken over . Lying to our families . And the Russians up here for what ? To set up some listening devices ? I don 't know . That makes no sense . Come on , think about Watergate , Nate . That was our president for God 's sake . And you don 't think the D.o.D which is lie to us ? So what are we doing up here ? What we 're really doing ? This can be spooky a little . Strange beauty in the backside . I do not know if my mind plays tricks on me but every so often you go to those little windows get this sense as if something is looking back . Looking back to you . Nate , look at this . - What ? - Look at this ! The flag is gone . - This isn 't right . - Houston , this is 18 . Over . Houston , Liberty . Did you see anything unusual in the Westinghouse last night ? We had some interferences . Our flag has gone . Repeat again . Repeat once . Maybe the other cosmonaut took it . If there is another cosmonaut he would need oxygen for minimum 10 to 12 hours . - What do you think , John ? - There is no way . He can not carry that much . So , how can he survive ? Maybe there is not a ' he ' . You 're saying the Soviet flew one man mission ? - It would not be the first time . - One cosmonaut ... But who took the flag ? Who killed the other cosmonaut we found ? Please get the D.o.D online . Now . We suspect that the Soviets are there , but we have no confirmation . The Intelligence warned that they might be disguising the machines as routine satellite launches . Why the hell did not you tell us ? National security . We carried out the card pretty close to the desk . No other option . I 'm sure you can understand . Maybe a little too close . We were concerned that they might ride to the sky first . That would be a national security disaster . So , where the hell is the other cosmonaut ? They 're just gonna leave him here ? Our intelligence suggests there was only one cosmanaut . Oh , God ! The mission is complete . Time to get you boys home again . So , that 's it ? First we return home and ask questions later . - What was that ? - Let 's get out of here . It looks pretty good . Ten seconds . Ten seconds . Wait for my mark . - Eight ... - Time to go home . Seven , six ... - That 's the alarm . - We can 't go . No go . We are no go . Save this damn thing . I try . I got a power glitch . Use the spare oxygen . - We have a leak somewhere . - I try to isolate the tanks . See if I can stop it . Houston , do you copy ? Houston , do you copy ? We lost communication . Dropped out . Closed . - No , no . - What the hell is going on ? Houston , this is Liberty . Over . We just lost communication . - How the hell did that happen ? - I don 't know . Maybe hit the LEM , or a meteor rain . There 's no way no tell . I 'm gonna to the air . Are you sure about this ? We need communication to get home . You just stay here and wait . - Look , I served in the army ... - Shut up . Go down the platform . Nothing on the bottom . EMD ... Six days . 13 hours , 46 minutes . Commander Walker is performing an unplanned DVA to repair the antenna on the Roover . We experience ... we experience some unexplained malfunctions . The whole installation seems damaged . Could be the brief impact but I don 't see any meteor residue . - This reaped to pieces . - Something crashed it ? I can 't tell . We get the same sound each time we activated the communication .. - Go to a different frequency . - Frequency is blocked . I never heard anything like it . Wait . Wait . Nate , talk to me . What do you see ? Footprint tracks . Footprints ? Maybe there is another cosmonaut . No . Mission Duration : Six days , 13 hours , 47 minutes . Commander Nathan Walker . We witness tracks that could be evidence of extraterrestial contact . We witness tracks that could be evidence of extraterrestial contact . Do you know what you 're saying ? These tracks are not human . I found the flag . It 's shreded . And the motion censor camera gone . That looks OK . I 'm turning the Roover back up . The connection looks good . Try contact to Houston or Freedom . Freedom , copy ? Houston , do you copy ? Dammit . - No , looks not working . - OK . Let me try something . Wait . - Something is moving . - What ? - I don 't see anything - There 's something in my boots . It 's in my helmet . - OK , listen to me . Go back to the lab . - I can 't get it out ! - Listen.Go back to the lab . OK ? - I can 't get it out . There is nothing inside your suit . Go back to the ship . It 's in my helmet . Don 't take it out ! Nate ! Jesus Christ ! Nate ! Nate ! Nate ! You need oxygen . Come on Nate ! Keep moving . We 're almost there . Keep moving . Almost there . Come on . Come on . Almost there . Pull yourself up . The door is closed . Cabin press auto , 4.5 psi . You don 't get enough oxygen . Breathe ! Breathe ! One . Look at me in the eye . You 'll be fine . Two . Two and a half . The cabin pressure is stable . It 's okay . So , you OK ? I 'm fine . What happened out there ? You 've started screaming , I 've come out there and you 're on your back . Liberty , this is Freedom . Do you hear me ? Over . Liberty , this is Freedom . Do you copy ? Houston , this is Freedom . Do you hear me ? We hear you , John . Over . I can 't receive the Liberty , Tommy . Copy that Freedom . We have the same problem down here . Have you tried to change the frequency ? No . We had some sort of interference . Could have something to do with those PSD5 . We are not sure yet that PDS5 are the source of the problem . I want to switch shut down the receivers to see what happened . Negative . Why not ? We got two men down there Tommy . Come on . Tommy ? Are you there ? We are working on the problem . We 'll keep you adviced . Oh , you 're working on it . That 's great . God damn it . Liberty , this is Freedom . Do you copy ? EMD ... Six days , 16 hours , 12 minutes . Post DVA 1,5 hours with Commander Walker I 've already told everything I remember . Come on . Are you paranoid , Ben ? I thought I saw something ... I thought I saw something on the corner of my eye . I was wrong and then there was a shrieking voice and caught off guard . I must have hit a rock . That 's it . You said something was in your helmet . You yelled . I don 't remember that . Christ ! You 're bleeding . Look at your shirt . You bleed . Jeez . Take the first aid kit . You said that something was inside your suit . That 's what you said . You said inside your helmet . I wonder how did you get that wound . If there is something in your suit , where the hell did it go ? Wait a second . Nate , I can feel it right here . Oh , man ! Something 's inside . - What are you talking about ? - Look , it 's just below the skin . I need to get that out . OK ? Yeah . OK . Just make it quick . Everything is right . Hang in there ! Damn , it seems to be moving . Get it out . - I got it ! I got it ! - Get it out ! Jesus ! - Are you alright ? - Yes , yes . Put this on it . It looks like one of my samples . You said you felt something 's moving in your helmet . I don 't understand , how did this get in ... Goddamn , you contaminated the entire ship . Liberty , do you copy ? Houston , we hear you . Liberty , do you copy ? Dammit Houston , we hear you . Liberty , do you receive ? They can 't hear us . Liberty , do you hear ? Those PSD5 's what if they 're not there to spy on the Russians ? What do you mean ? They told us that the transmitters pick up any frequency , but they don 't . They 're blocking our communication , transmitting a signal . Alright . And why would they do that ? No , keep filming . Keep filming . We need to document this . To attract the Soviets , made the tracks is ... whatever killed the cosmonaut . All these cameras , man they 're watching us . We are alone . We are guinea pigs . That 's why they sent us here . We have to turn off those transmitters . PSD5 's destroyed . Brilliant . Nice tracks . They were here . Let 's check on the other sides . Liberty , do you copy ? Liberty , do you copy ? Liberty , do you copy ? Something 's down here . It 's gone . Hey , what are you looking at ? This was a bad idea . You need to get rest , Nate . OK ? We 're get to back to lab . We need to get back , Nate . Oh , Jesus Christ , Nate . It 's in your blood stream . The previous wound seems to become infected . Eyes are extremely bloodshot . I do not know how to treat it . Houston , this is Freedom . I haven 't be able to reach Nate or Ben . Communication 's still down with Liberty . We have no communication with the crew we 're receiving data from the LEM . We 're trying to restore the communication now . Standby . Liberty , this is Houston . Looks like you can hear us , but we can 't hear you . Block the Westinghouse and survival craft 's getting land down . We estimate 12 hours left on your live support and we are now sorting out the engine problems . We 'll do everything we can to get you home . ... and we are now sorting out the engine problems . We 'll do everything we can to get you home . They 're lying . No , they 'll get us back . Thay 'll get us back . They want that footage . - What about the Russian ship ? - The poor Russian bastard . It looks infected . Just like me . I 'm getting worse . Ben ... - ... you must leave me here . - No . - No one leaves anyone . - You have to . Forget it . We won 't die uphere . Fate has renamed . The men who went to the moon to export peace remained on the moon to rest in peace . What the hell are you talking about ? I feel my toughts ... fragmenting . I can be attracted to them . I 'm so tired . EMD Six days , 22 hours , 23 minutes . Alan B. Anderson . Doctorial There were no further communication with Houston . Oxygen levels are low . Nate 's being sleep for about an hour . The sickness seems brougth fatigue . We 're not gonna make it here . If Houston doesn 't come up with the plans in the next couple hours , we 'll .. ... we 'll abandon Liberty and go to the Russian LK . Their communications and oxygen are our only hope . Just pray to God . Jesus Christ ! Jesus ! Partial respiration . Upper left rib ... The infection 's spreading . God damn it . Must be the same thing that happened to the Russian . - Nate ! - I don 't let you kill me ! It 's me . Listen to me . Look at me . It 's me . Ok ? I 'm just trying to help you . You 're getting worse . Don 't ever touch me ! - Nate , please , what the hell are you doing ? - They are everywhere . - Please , Nate , you 'll kill us all ! - Stop watch us ! Nate ! You 're not gonna watch how I die ! What are you doing ? Stop ! Stop ! Come on ! You ... Stop there ! Stop that ! Liberty , this is Freedom . Do you read me ? Liberty , this is Freedom . I don 't know if you hear me , but I 'm gonna be in the comm range soon . Guys , we need to get you out of there . There is ... Do you copy ? Come on , guys , Don 't make me leave you here . Freedom , you read us ? John ... John , can you hear me ? Please , anyone ... can you hear me ? We are leaving Liberty . - Come on . - I had to do it . Take the camera . We have 25 % of the tank . We can use some reserv . We 'll get there . I get to get the films . Black box of the D.o.D I get to go down . It 's clear . Come Nate , we go . They are everywhere . You can 't help me . You don 't have to be here . That 's OK . - It 's gonna be OK . - Alright . We 're gonna make it . They 're waiting for me . We are not safe here . - Get rid of me . - Hang in . What the hell are you doing ? Hang on ! Nate ! Nate ! EMD I don 't know ... Roover has been destroyed . There is no sign of Commander Walker . American astronaut , Ben Anderson , Apollo 18 . Oxygen is getting low . I 'm ... I 'm gonna search for the Russian later . Hey , Commander Walker . Nate ! Go away from here , Ben . This is where they 're coming from . There 's nothing here , OK ? You get to come with me . God damn it ! We need get moving . Ben , listen to me . We 're running out of time here , please . You must find the LK ? Their system is identical with ours . Save yourself . No , Nate ! I 'm not going . You 're coming with me . You have to leave me here . Just get the John . - I 'm not leaving here ! - You can 't help me . But you can save yourself ... Nate ! Nate ! Can you hear me ? Nate ! Answer me ! Do you hear me ? Say something Nate . Nate , where are you ? No ! No ! My god . No ! John , Nate is gone . Repeat , Nate is gone . Please , can somebody hear me ? Oh , my God ! Nate ! Come on ! Frequency is completed . This is an American astronaut . Ben Anderson , Apollo 18 . Been copy ? This is Apollo 18 . Do you copy ? Anyone , do you copy ? Anyone , please . Do you copy ? Anything , anybody , do you copy ? Damn ! Confirming Commander Walker . - Acknowledge . - This is Captain Ben Anderson ... Do you copy ? This is Ben Anderson . Copy , anybody ? Anybody , please ! Do you read me ? Captain Anderson , this is the Deputy Secretary of Defense . What ? D.o.D ? Yes . Yes , this is Captain Ben Anderson . We communicate with the Russians and they 're putting me through you . We 're aware of your condition that and we have decided . - ... we can 't you home . - No . No , no ! Listen to me please . Nate get a cut on his body . He 's infected . There 's nothing on me . Please , have to come and get me . We can 't get you . We can 't get you . Please ... Listen , I ... I ... got a family and I need my family . We 'll let your family know you died a hero . I 'm sorry Captain . You have to get me out of here ! And you fucking do it right now ! I will not give up until you get me home ! Houston , please . We 'll stay in on this channel with you but the decision is final . You 've done a great service for your country , son . EMD ... Still no communication . Astronaut Brian Anderson , with his dad , flies through the space . - Brian , what are you doing ? - Just playing , mom . Do not play with the your dad 's stuff . - Is that recording ? - Sorry , Dad , I love you . - Is that recording ? - Sorry , Dad , I love you . ... love you . ... Dad , I love you . ... love you . This is Freedom , are you hearing me ? - This is Freedom ... - John , it 's Ben . I hear you . Ben , is that you ? Do you copy ? Yes , John , I am . I hear you . I got you on the VHF , partner . Where the hell are you ? - Soviet 's LK . - Yes . Good for you . They left me , John . Left me here ! Where is Nate ? How 's he ? Get sick , he did not make it . There 's something down here , John . And they knew about it . You hear me ? Those bastards knew about it ! Forget about the D.o.D , man . Ben , I 'm get you out of there , OK ? Did you figure out that thing ? I don 't have much choice . Do we ? Powers look good . And there is plenty fuel . Okay , buddy . You 're gonna be in the darkness yet you 're gonna need to get your synchronized orbit then you need a little space for . Safely on board . How does that sound ? Sounds beautiful Johnny . Sound very beautiful . I don 't mean rush you partner but we 're running out of time . Get that thing in the orbit . We can run into it . I got it ! I got it , John . Seven . Six . Five . - Holy shit ! - Open this door . Nate , you know I can 't do that . Please , you 'll kill us both ! I can 't let you in . - I 'm coming there . - No , no ! Nate , please ! - Nate , stop this Nate ! - What 'd you mean ? - It 's Nate ! - What is happening ? - Come on buddy ! Stop ! Stop ! - What 's going on ? - Don 't do this ! - What do you think ? Jesus Christ ! No ! Nate ! Nate ! Oh , my God ! Nate ! No ! No , no , no ! You can launch . You must do it now . Our window is almost gone . You have to launch . Dammit , they were kind of too close . We 're going home ! Ben , listen to me now . We 're going to go home . Heard that ? We 're going to go home . I 'm going home . We lifted up ! Freedom , do you read ? This is the Deputy Secretary of Defense . Ben has been contaminated . Do not try to rescue him . I repeat . You will not recover him . Contaminated by what ? D.o.D ? - What do you say ? Where is Tommy ? - You will not recover Anderson . This a direct order . I 'm on my way . John , you 're abording the rescue immediately . Captain Anderson has been contaminated . You knew something was down there and you sent them anyway ! I 'm coming home . I 'm coming home . D.o.D to Freedom If you 're not abording in 60 seconds transmittion will be terminated . You 'll not receive updated statement . You 'll run out of life support craft and you 'll not return home .

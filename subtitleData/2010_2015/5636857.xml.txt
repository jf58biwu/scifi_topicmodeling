 Coulson : Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... You really felt nothing for them . I spent time with Coulson . He 's a good man . - Skye : Is that your badge ? - Coulson : They look like coordinates . Man : Welcome , Agent Coulson . We 've been expecting you . - What is this place ? - Koenig : One of Fury 's secret bases . Eric Koenig , agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. , level 6 . What about Ward ? He and Agent Hand should have dropped Garrett off at the Fridge by now . Ward : S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s most secure facility is vulnerable right now . Yeah , well ... we 're gonna raid it . This is a hard drive with all of Simmons ' research . Raina : She programmed it to erase all data if anyone other than her attempts to access it . You know what that means , Romeo . You got your story straight ? Ward : I just need some time alone with her to get the information . 1x19 - The Only Light in the Darkness [ harbour bell dinging ] [ electricity crackling ] [ electricity humming ] Man : Another example of this administration 's lack of transparency . Woman : You can 't seriously be blaming the president for this . Those who let S.H.I.E.L.D. operate without oversight should be held accountable . If your party held the White house , would you be taking this position ? If my party held the White house , we wouldn 't be in this position . - I need a ride . - Sorry . What ? - I need a ride to Portland . - Sorry , dude . I 'm not going 200 miles out of my way just to give you a ride . Okay . - Somehow , it 's someone else 's fault ? - At the very least ... [ electricity hums ] [ engine turns off ] Hal : What the ... All right , I give up . How did you do that ? Like this . [ engine turns over ] ... we cannot allow Hydra and their allies to rise again . [ radio tuning ] [ classical music plays ] [ electricity crackling ] I 'm afraid this might scar . Skye : Upside ... you 'll look badass , dangerous . He 's gonna be fine , though , right ? He will if you back up and give me some room . So , what then ? By the time we got to the Fridge , it was too late . It was overrun ... Hydra everywhere . We couldn 't stop them . - What were they after ? - Everything . They took weapons , alien artifacts ... anything they could grab . I assume that means the prisoners are no longer prisoners ? - So ... Ian Quinn ... - I 'm sorry . He 's out . They all are . [ indistinct shouting ] And Garrett ? Did he get away ? Couldn 't stop them from taking the Fridge , but I wasn 't gonna let Garrett walk ... not after what he did . Is he the one that did this to you ? He was a tough son of a bitch . We need to make it believable . [ grunting ] " Was " ? Past tense ? As soon as I had the upper hand , I put two in the back of his head . - Good . - One from me ... one from you . - I would have emptied the mag . - Simmons : You 're all set ... well , I mean , as set as you can be with two cracked ribs and a zygomatic fracture . Uh , for those of you that don 't know what that is , that 's a ... Both : Hairline fracture to the cheekbone . Your body needs time to heal . - Please take some time . - Understood . Thanks . Ah . One small victory . Hydra didn 't get their hands on this . - A hard drive ? - It 's all the research our team 's ever done , downloaded off the plane and encrypted for safekeeping . We should probably back it up now that we 're in a secure facility . First , Skye , I need you on threat assessment . Pull up a list of all the inmates at the Fridge . I want to know just how bad this is . Skye : This is really , really bad . Quinn is the least scary of the bunch , and he shot me ... twice . Quinn 's more a sociopath . A lot of those inmates are full-blown psychopaths ... - Violent , impulsive . - And some with superpowers . - Lovely . - Is Marcus Daniels on the list ? That 's him . Cross-check the list of inmates with crime databases , recent activity . Got a feeling we 'll be seeing a slight uptick . Okay , but that 'll take time , and more computing power than my laptop . Agent Koenig probably has some sort of ... I 'm sure he 'll lend a hand . The plane you flew in on ... is it operational ? Yeah . You need me to pilot ? [ grunts ] You heard Simmons . You stay and get better . I 'm gonna take a splinter team out and start going after inmates on that list , starting with Mr. Daniels . I think I know where he 's going . Uh , you sure it 's wise to split up the team , leave this base ? What if it 's part of Hydra 's plan ... a distraction ? Skye : She 's got a point . I mean , Fury brought you to this base for a reason . - We 're safe here . - Yeah , we 're safe here . But what about everyone else ... people who don 't happen to have access to a top-secret underground shelter ? What about them ? I don 't know if it 's wise , but it 's right . I 'm taking a team , and that 's the end of it . No , you 're not . Absolutely not . You can 't leave . There are protocols . Since the entire agency 's pretty much collapsed , maybe now 's not the time to stand on protocol . Okay , fine . Then forget protocols . What part of " secret base " don 't you get ? Fury said to let you in , and you show up with a bunch of people ? - Agents ! - Whatever . The point is , they know where this place is now , and I don 't know them . Hydra just released the entire population of the Fridge into the wild . There 's gonna be violence . People will die . And I still consider it my duty to be the shield that protects them . [ sighs ] Moving speech , truly . But nobody leaves until they go through orientation . Orientation ? [ whirring ] Koenig : All right . Just gonna need you guys to answer a few questions , a few psychoanalytic , non sequitur questions . - A lie detector . - The lie detector , Agent Coulson . This baby measures galvanic skin response , oxygen consumption , micro-expressions , biofeedback brain waves , pupil dilation , voice biometrics ... 96 variables in all . Fury designed this himself . He wanted a lie detector Romanoff couldn 't beat . - Did she ? - [ scoffs ] Like Fury would tell ! Okay . Sooner we get this done , sooner we can get to work . So who wants to go first ? We 're gonna start with some easy questions and establish a baseline . Can I have your full name ? Melinda Qiaolian May . [ beeping , whirring ] - Eye color ? - Brown . - You ever been married ? - Once . - Have you ever been married ? - No . - Please list your immediate family . - Just me and my mum . So you 're not gonna mention your grandfather ? It 's not something I advertise . Didn 't want to be treated any different because I 'm a legacy . If I was the grandson of a Howling Commando , I 'd have that tattooed on my chest . - What is your first name ? - Skye . And what is your last name ? Only name . No family . No family name to inherit . And you gave yourself the name Skye ? Well , the name they gave me at the orphanage - was Mary Sue Poots , so ... - When we were kids , my brother and I used to give each other nicknames . He called me " lightning foot . " [ chuckles ] What 's the difference between an egg and a rock ? Edible . Not . Well , that 's absurd . The differences are innumerable . If you want , I can start listing them , but then we 'll be here all day . - Have you ever heard of project Insight ? - No . - No . - No . Ever had any contact with Alexander Pierce ? I 've met him . We shook hands . Garrett would get a call from him once in a while , said they had mutual friends . You wash up on a deserted island alone . Sitting on the sand is a box . - What is in that box ? - Machete . A sat phone so I can call someone to get me off that island . How big is the box ? Just say the first answer that comes into your mind . - What 's in that box ? - Simmons . That 's a hard one . Let me think . The tardis . I want to say my laptop , fully charged . But I don 't want to seem subversive - with the Rising Tide and all ... - You 're over-thinking it . The laptop would be stupid , anyway . There 's no wi-fi . S.H.I.E.L.D. no longer exists . The agency has been labeled a terrorist organization . - So why are you here ? - Honestly ... I 'm not entirely sure . [ beeping , whirring ] We have to stick together , keep the people we trust close-by . No one else , really . My grandfather fought Hydra back in the day . The good guys won then . We 'll do it again . Coulson . It 's the only home I 've ever known . [ beeping , whirring ] Congratulations , Agent Skye . Let 's go get you a lanyard . [ door opens and closes ] - Got my backstage pass . - [ chuckles ] Piece of cake ? If you don 't mind talking about yourself . So you 'll hate it . [ sighs ] Have fun . [ footsteps depart ] [ sighs ] - What is your full name ? - My name is Grant Douglas Ward . Please list your immediate family . Two parents , a sister , two brothers . Don 't have contact with any of them . Boy , your baseline 's getting a lot of spikes . Are you in pain ? Yeah , only when I breathe . Two broken ribs . Okay , well , try not to move . - It may affect the results . - I 'll try my best . Marcus Daniels was an assistant at a physics lab where they were trying to harness the electrical power of something called Darkforce . And nothing bad ever happens when you work with something called " Darkforce . " It 's a form of cosmic radiation , pure negative energy . Unstable but powerful . You knew that already , didn 't you ? Daniels was exposed , ended up being able to absorb energy ... all types . Well , the human brain , the heart , run on electrical impulses . Exactly . He can kill with one touch . And I 'm guessing he likes to . [ magazine clicks ] Do we need to put a bullet in him ? Unfortunately , it 's not that simple . He can absorb the energy of most conventional weapons . - He sounds unstoppable . - Like Fitz said , his power 's unstable . Last time , we managed to capture him by overloading his system with pure light . Exposing him to more energy than he could absorb at once . I 'm sure we could engineer some sort of delivery mechanism en route . That 's what I was hoping you were gonna say . You mind flying , being the specialist on mission ? Sir , I 'll be whatever you want me to be . That 's what I was hoping you were gonna say . [ chuckles ] [ sighs ] What is the difference between an egg and a rock ? Egg 's a food . Rock 's a weapon . - Have you ever heard of project Insight ? - No . Ever made contact with Alexander Pierce ? - No . - You wash up on a deserted island alone . Sitting on the sand is a box . What 's in that box ? It would depend on the island ... Where it is , how big , what 's the terrain ? Is there fresh water ? Just say the first thing that comes into your head . A pistol . S.H.I.E.L.D. no longer exists . the agency has been labeled a terrorist organization . So why are you here ? I 'm an agent . It 's my duty . [ beeping , whirring ] I need you to give that to me again . It 's my duty . [ beeping , whirring ] I 'm gonna ask you a follow-up . Agent Ward , are you associated with Hydra ? Yes . We all are . They 've infiltrated the highest levels of our orgazation . Like you mean it . Are you Hydra ? I 'm loyal to S.H.I.E.L.D ... to Agent Coulson ... and to my team . Do you have another agenda here ? I 'll give you 24 hours to get the password and get out . After that , well ... cross off the team and bring the girl to me . Agent Ward , why are you really here ? Skye . [ beeping , whirring ] Came back for her . I want to spend time with her . [ beeping , whirring ] Skye ? Cool . [ groaning ] Hey . Ward . [ grunts ] - Hey . Got my lanyard . - Nice . So , are you guys taking off ? Yeah , I wish you were coming instead of trip . - He 's insufferable , isn 't he ? - Trip ? - Yeah . - Think the guy 's okay . I know . He 's terrible . He 's a horrible person . You sure this is about him ? Not about Simmons ? What the hell does that mean ? Everything is falling apart around us . We don 't know how it 'll end . If there 's something you want to tell her , don 't wait . Maybe Simmons should check you again for a head injury ... [ scoffs ] ... ' cause that 's not the Ward that I know . You know what ? Do what you want . I don 't care . Good to have you back . - I should be flying this mission . - I made another call . Stay here . Get the fuel line repaired on the bus . I remember when you brought Daniels in . I know how personal this is for you , but ... We don 't do personal ... not anymore . Phil , the polygraph cleared me . I 'm not hiding anything . You mean you 're not hiding anything else , unless you do know who was behind the Tahiti project . I didn 't ask . I was ordered not to . And you would have done the same thing . Our job is to follow orders . It 's also our job to determine right from wrong . Watching someone in agony , searching for the truth , not saying anything ... that 's wrong . - Look , I was just trying ... - And don 't tell me it 's because you care so damn much . Fury 's no longer around telling you what to do , so why are you here ? You want some orders to follow ? Follow mine , or find somewhere else to be . [ doors clang ] Simmons : How can you be sure he 's going to Portland ? Daniels was obsessed with a woman there . He called her his only light in the darkness . That 's almost romantic ! Almost . The man 's been locked up in the Fridge for years . - He must be over her by now . - Some people are hard to get over . Besides , Daniels is pathologically insane , single-minded , obsessive . His powers not only robbed him of a normal life , they also pretty much fried his brain . - What about the woman ? - Audrey Nathan . She 's how we tracked him the first time . We find Ms. Nathan , we find Daniels . [ sighs ] [ electricity crackling ] [ classical music plays ] [ high-pitched humming , music stops ] [ electricity crackling ] [ tires screech ] Audrey Nathan ! W-what ? ! There ... there ... there 's a man after me ! No , we know . We 're with the CIA . Get in ! [ electricity crackling ] [ tires squeal ] [ tires screech ] Mr. Daniels , we don 't want to hurt you . We need to take you in , for your safety and the safety of others . It was you ! You took me there ! [ beep , whirring ] [ beeping ] - They did things to me there ! - They were trying to contain you . No ! They were trying to make me stronger . And they did . [ grunts ] Here 's where we 'd normally call for reinforcements . Where 'd he go ? Skye : Here 's something ... Police report out of Morocco , attempted murder . The victim says the guy appeared out of nowhere , disappeared into thin air . Yeah , you just described every mugging ever . [ sighs ] [ beeping ] [ alarm beeping ] - Aren 't you clever ? - Aren 't you sneaky ? [ scoffs ] Using these to keep watch on all of us . What ? We have been killing ourselves trying to guess where these guys went . But what if we could see it , get visuals on where the prisoners went after leaving the Fridge ? [ chuckling ] That 's a good idea , but , uh , right now S.H.I.E.L.D. sat surveillance is dark . Ours aren 't the only ones up there . Well , the only other satellites in the vicinity that could have ... The NSA . You want to hack the NSA ? [ chuckling ] That 's a bad idea , Skye . That 's a terrible idea . The NSA 's already got S.H.I.E.L.D. on its watch list . Why poke the bear ... the big , scary , waterboarding bear ? Ohh ! I thought you were a comms agent , not agent of playing video games while hiding in a bunker . You can 't goad me into ... [ sighs ] Can you help me convince Steve Rogers here to suit up , grab his shield , head into battle ? Okay ? Who 's he supposed to battle ? If we hack NSA satellites , we can get footage from the Fridge breakout , see who was there , where they went . Well , she 's right . It 's worth trying . [ sighs ] You know , I can 't hack the NSA , but maybe I can upload the hard drive you gave me , get the specs on the weapons they might be carrying . Absolutely . We should . But we can 't . The encryption is location-based . We 'll have to take a field trip at some point to decrypt it . Okay ! All right . Color me impressed . Now impress me more . Get me that footage . These are the keys to the comm / sat room . The mainframe is in there . Start the hack but then send the feed to these monitors . Let 's live dangerously . - Yeah ! - How long before you get visuals ? [ sighing ] Uh ... NSA satellites should be tough . - Give me an hour . - Great . This is exciting . Let 's see if being sneaky pays off . Simmons : We should be safe here . - I thought he was locked up . - He escaped from prison . You don 't have to worry . That 's why we 're here . We 're gonna keep you safe . " We " ? Meaning the CIA ? Of course . That 's what I said , isn 't it ? We 're the CIA , the Central Intelligence Agency ... - people . - You 're not . - You 're S.H.I.E.L.D. , aren 't you ? - We 're just trying to help . - We 're not the bad guys . - I know . I don 't believe what they 're saying about S.H.I.E.L.D. The agency saved my life once before . A few years ago , I saw Daniels at one of my concerts , front row . Then I started seeing him at all of them . At first , I was flattered . Cellists don 't get many groupies . But then one night , I saw him outside of my house . I was terrified . I begged him to leave me alone . He just stood there , saying I was his light . I didn 't understand what he meant until he started blacking out my entire block . I ran and called the police . They didn 't believe me . But then a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent came to my door . I don 't know why , but I trusted him right away . Something about his face ... the handsome part , maybe . He just swooped in . It was like ... out of a movie . - You two were ... close ? - Very . He promised me he would stop Daniels . And that 's exactly what he did . That 's why I know I can trust S.H.I.E.L.D. - Phil never lied to me . - Phil ? Agent Phillip Coulson ? Triplett : I 've heard the name . Is that ... Audrey was ... you two were ... - Yeah . - Okay . Simmons : What happened to him ? He died in the line of duty . I don 't know the details . We were planning a trip up the coast , and then I got the call . You must miss him . For so long after he died , everything reminded me of him . I still dream about him sometimes , just us together , laughing . [ inhales deeply ] I wake up feeling like he 's watching over me . It 's nice . Maybe you should go in there . No , she 's healing . She 's getting on with her life . We should help her do that . I think I know a way , how to stop Daniels for good . But we would have to use her to draw him either . No . Do you understand ? That 's not acceptable . Well , it 's not ideal , but there 's no other choice . I won 't put her in danger again . That 's not fair to her . But , sir , I 'm sorry , but she 's already in danger . And you said it yourself ... Daniels is single-minded . He 's dangerous . He won 't stop until he gets what he wants . How 's it coming ? - Is the bus operational ? - Still banged up , but she 's ready to fly . The fuel line 's been repaired , and the tank 's full . What 's the range on this thing ? Just under 10,000 miles . - Are you leaving ? - Yeah . I was here for Coulson . - But he can 't see past me lying to him . - I get why you did it . When you get orders , you don 't question ' em . You follow ' em ... no matter the price . Yeah , well , this price was too high . [ sighs ] I lost him . Coulson doesn 't want me here . He doesn 't need me . So , what should I tell him ? Whatever you want . He won 't hear it . [ doors whir ] [ doors clang ] How 's it going ? Oh ! Hey . Believe it or not , Skye got us in ! We have access to the NSA 's complete sat-feed history ! That girl 's good . I can see why you like her . Uh , the images are a little patchy , but they 're gonna clear up any second . Uh , I guess living on the edge really pays off sometimes . Yeah . Sometimes . Audrey : What if he doesn 't show ? Triplett : Before they put him away , he never missed a rehearsal , right ? - No . - Then he won 't this time , either . Don 't worry . We 'll be close . All you need to do is keep playing until Daniels gets close to the stage . We 'll do the rest . Last time , there were two whole teams of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents . See up there ? Our best agents are watching . I promise . They won 't let anything happen to you . I pulled these from the jet 's power reserves . Simmons made me wear gloves . [ chuckles ] She 's so uptight , that one . Sir . - Good . Can they stop him ? - Okay , well , this will modify the frequency and wavelength of the stage lights , although technically they wouldn 't be lights at that point . - More like gamma rays . - Tell me this will work . I gave Daniels to S.H.I.E.L.D. to rehabilitate him . Turns out , they just gave him an upgrade . Well , I mean , there 's a slight chance he would absorb the energy and gain more power , but it 's unlikely . Who did you say created this technology , again ? Bruce Banner . Then I 'm sure it 'll go off without a hitch . Eric . Eric ? You did it . [ exhales sharply ] Koenig said you managed to hack the NSA . Yeah , it looks that way . Where did he go ? He 's sending everything over to NATO , CIA , Interpol . Guess he hopes they 'll take it as a sign of good faith from S.H.I.E.L.D. That 's smart . Though , looks like all I got was lots of views of an empty rooftop . - May 's gone . - What do you mean " gone " ? - Gone where ? - She left . I 'm sure if I asked where , she wouldn 't have told me . [ exhales sharply ] Wow . So , no goodbye ? No nothing ? She never felt anything for us , did she ? She just played us so she could keep an eye on Coulson . That was her mission . - Did you feel anything for her ? - Um ... no . The only comfort we took in each other was knowing we didn 't have to . You can 't choose to feel . Usually , I can . It 's different with us . " Us " is a strong word . I mean , I know I kissed you , but to be fair , I thought there was a 97 % chance we were gonna ... die . [ chuckles ] - But we didn 't die . - Which is good . Yes , that is very good . But there 's still no rush on us being an " us . " It 's not like it 's a good time to start anything . There 's never a good time . [ inhales deeply ] We 've got to start somewhere . You better get going . Daniels will be here soon . Simmons : Okay , you 'll be fine . Why don 't you tell her the truth ... that you 're still alive ? Sir , it 's just the way she talks about you sounds like you two had something nice . We did . So it 's not because you 're afraid to talk to her . I don 't want to hurt her again . Besides , it 's not like I can stay . - We have a job to do . - Yeah . Skye : If that 's how you felt , you had a funny way to show it . Specialists don 't spend time with a lot of people . The ones we do , we 're all cut from the same cloth . Black kevlar ? Trained to get the job done , keep emotions in check . But you ... you 're different . - " Different " bad ? - Bad for me . I didn 't want to think about you . I wanted to stay focused . And then I saw you after you were shot ... fighting to stay alive ? But you 're right . I 'm kevlar . You 're not . You don 't have to be . You don 't have to shut people out . Yeah , I do . There are things about me ... that you wouldn 't like if you knew . You think I don 't have skeletons ? It 's different . You 're ... - ... good . - So are you . Not always . [ glass thuds ] I lied to you . [ inhales deeply ] My older brother ... he didn 't beat up my younger brother . He was crueler than that . He made me do it . And I let him . I was afraid of him . - What about your parents ? - They were worse . I am not a good man , Skye . Hey . Yes , you are . [ inhales sharply ] Mmm . Oh . Yeah , one of my ... one of my cuts must have just opened up . - Let me help . Let me help . - No , no , no , no . No . I just need to clean up . [ cello playing ] [ sighs ] [ beeping ] There you are , Eric . [ playing continues ] [ electricity crackles ] [ electricity crackles ] [ playing stops ] No . Keep playing . I 'm sorry I scare you . I know that I 'm a monster . But you 're the one that can save me . Come on . [ playing resumes ] Eric ? [ clink ] That 's weird . [ playing continues ] [ humming ] Eric ? [ beeping ] Eric . [ gasps ] [ gasping ] Ward . [ cello playing ] [ electricity crackling ] Aah ! [ clatter ] [ gasping ] Jemma . No . Please ! [ breathing shakily ] [ electricity crackling ] [ screaming ] No , no . [ breathing shakily ] No . [ crying ] No . Oh , no . Ward : Skye ? ! [ gasps ] Skye ! [ breathes shakily ] He 's Hydra . [ gasping , crying ] [ exhales sharply ] Okay . Okay , okay . Okay . Okay . Ward : Skye . [ breathing heavily ] Oh . [ panting ] You 're safe . I 'm still here . I promise . I 'm still here with you . [ sighs ] [ exhales deeply ] - Phil ... - Are you okay ? I ... I thought ... he was here . Seemed so real this time . See what we want to see , I guess . I guess so . [ sighs ] [ sighs ] Skye : Hey . Think I 'd be hiding in a closet ? I was wondering where you went . I went back to the room . You weren 't there . - Why did you leave ? - Truth ? - I 'd appreciate it . - You scared me . Opening up , and that kiss ... which ... was a very nice kiss , I admit . I didn 't mean to scare you . I don 't exactly over-analyze . I just act impulsively , and then I freak out after the fact . Are you still ? No . I 'm good . [ chuckles ] I want this . And you ? What do you want ? What I want ... is to stay here with you and imagine the world outside doesn 't exist . But the world outside does exist . I just got word from Fitz . They need our help . The bus is fueled up , ready to go . - We should tell Koenig . - I just did . He 's headed outside to open the hangar doors . We 're in a hurry . I just got to grab a couple things . Hey . We need to go right now . Of course we do . [ chuckles ] Lead the way . Sir . Is everything okay ? She said I never lied to her . Today , I did . But she 's alive and safe . We did that , at least . Why didn 't you tell her the truth ? I will . Someday , I guess , when there 's a chance she 'll understand . When we get back , I need to make things right with May . How can I expect Audrey to forgive me if I 'm not willing to do the same ? [ footsteps approach ] I 'm gonna check with Trip and see how much longer we have . - We need to talk . - We do ? Agent Triplett thinks he 's done something to upset you . Fitz , if you 're questioning his loyalty in any way , - I can assure you ... - It 's not him . Well , what is it , then ? Uh ... you know how I can be . I hate change . - Where 's our bus ? - And our team ? I don 't know . [ switches click ] It 's so beautiful . So , are we off to Portland ? Actually , Fitz thinks the 0-8-4 plasma ray we found in Peru might help . Didn 't we jettison that to the sun ? - Yeah , but Fitz has the specs on it . - On the hard drive . Mhm . You need me to decrypt the hard drive . The team does . And since it 's coupled to specific coordinates , Agent Skye ... you 're in charge . Where to next ? Coulson : We 'll return in a moment . [ door closes ] [ seat belt clicks ] [ engine shuts off ] What are you doing ? We have to go . - 500 miles . - What ? 500 miles , and I don 't even get a " thank you . " [ sighs ] I was just about to ... - It 's too late . - ... thank you . I said too late . [ sighs ] You can call anybody you like . Why me ? I needed someone I can trust . That bad , huh ? [ sighs ] Did you get it ? I may be retired , but I still have contacts . And my agency hasn 't fallen apart . You 're not the only one looking , you know . - She won 't be hard to find . - I know . [ engine turns over ] You 're not gonna take her out , are you ? No , Mom . I just want to talk . Good . I 've always liked Maria .

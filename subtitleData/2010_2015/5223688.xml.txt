 ROSEN : Previously on Alphas ... HARKEN : Parish 's organization is huge and nasty , and about to pull the trigger on something big . ( SCREAMING ) That 's the sixth attack on the power grid this week . In a day or two we 'll have these power grid protectors in place everywhere . So Parish will have a hard time keeping this up . ROSEN : October 22nd , 1862 . That is when Stanton Parish discovered he was an Alpha . A hundred and fifty years to the day . Terrorists love anniversaries . The doctor said that my mom was either gonna die or she 'll be able to come home , but he won 't tell me which and he won 't tell me when . We did not kill Dani . ROSEN : Stanton Parish did . I do know that if Cley catches Parish , he 'll put him in prison . He doesn 't deserve to go to prison . No . Hello , Cornell . ( SCREAMING ) This has gone far enough . ( SCIPIO SCREAMING ) KAT : Oh , my God . What the hell did you people do ? SKYLAR : This is what I designed for Parish . It 's a mini photo-stim controller . The power goes in , the flashes come out . It 's like steroids for an Alpha . If it doesn 't kill you , it makes you stronger . What happens to people who aren 't Alphas ? Mostly , they die . Look , whatever he 's planning , he 's planning to do it all over the place . Now , look at this . Cameron , you need to get all of this information to Bill . Doc , I 'm not leaving you here . You have a family , I don 't . You take this . You might need it . Where 's Parish ? Is he here ? I 'm gonna watch the world change with a God 's-eye view . What do you mean , God 's-eye view ? What ... What is that ? Hey , Dr. Rosen . ( GRUNTING ) ( SIREN BLARING ) DANI : Wake up . Dani . Oh , no . No , I 'm in shock . I 'm hallucinating . You can 't pass out . Then I need to get to a hospital . No . No , I can 't . BOTH : They report gunshot wounds to the police . Anyway , there 's no time . You don 't have time . You have ... You have to find him . I have to find him . You have to find him . I 've got to find him and I 've got to stop the bleeding or I 'll never make it . You know who can help you . Yes . Good . Good , get up . Now get up . ( HORN BLARING ) They found Rosen 's blood . And a worker at the armory heard gunshots . Okay , but we need to find him . Rosen 's out there alone , he 's bleeding ... Okay , listen , I will put a BOLO out on him , all right ? But we cannot afford to waste any more time . Be on the lookout ? That 's it ? Our number one priority right now is to stop Parish . Now , if Rosen was here , he would say the same thing . Ow ... Got it . ( GASPS ) You need surgery . Fiona , I came to you . Okay . So this part 's gonna hurt . I need to seal the major blood vessels . Now , take a deep breath for me . ( PANTING ) Oh ... Good . Ready ? ( GROANS ) All right , I did what I could , but my ability isn 't magic . So you 're gonna need to take it easy . I don 't want you to split yourself open again . ( GRUNTS ) There 's a couch in my office if you want to use it . Thank you , but I ... I don 't have time . Whoa . Okay . Wait a minute . If you 're going anywhere , your next stop has got to be the ER . I 'm serious . I know . I know . I just ... There 's something important I need to do . HARKEN : So the best we 're gonna do is ... He 's a plumber . He 's never heard of Stanton Parish . What the hell was he doing in the armory ? Putting in extra bathrooms . Really ? Stanton 's that concerned about his super-charged Alphas being nice and comfortable ? After everyone else is dead . We don 't know where the mini-stims are , how they 're going to be deployed , what 's gonna set them off . Why don 't you go back in there and push the rest of them so we can find out ? Get those line reports from NYPD ? Hey , look , I get it . Okay , obviously you 're mad . Yeah . This happens when I 'm nearly incinerated . Listen to me . You were not supposed to be on that convoy . Yeah , but you let me go anyway . Because you figured in a month I 'll just forget what a total douche you are , right ? I did what I had to do . It wasn 't about you . ( SCOFFS ) Kat ... Kat , where you going ? I 'm out of here . Hey , Kat ... You cannot leave . What are you doing ? You know this thing is about to go down . It could happen anytime within the next 24 hours . Remind me why I should care ? Because there are eight million people in this city alone . Yeah , and I don 't know any of them . The only people I know are in that room and they hung me out to dry . Have I hung you out to dry ? Have I ? Kat , listen to me . I need you . Yo , Jones . How 's the security retrofit coming ? This grid protector is giving me nothing but problems . ( MAN SINGING DRUNKENLY ) Hey ! We 're working here . ( CONTINUES SINGING ) C 'mon , man . We 've got , like , a dozen of these to do . This one 's a little hinky . You gotta finesse it . Almost got it ... Oh ! Hey , what 's going on with the grid protector ? ( ALL GRUNTING ) Here you go . Sure . Thanks . Hey , buddy . Oh , ho-ho ! Mmm , sweet , sweet day . Hmmm . I find it unseasonably humid . But that 's what you get when you screw with Mother Nature . Hmm . Selfish bastards . They did the best they could . And after tonight , some of them will be changed . And the rest ... Well , it should be quick and painless . I 've got all my guys set down at the backup generator . Good . Gather up Dr. Rosen , take him to the safe house . Be convincing , but no unnecessary violence . Yeah , about that ... Yes ? Dr. Rosen showed up in Yonkers last night . He was planning on taking you down , boss , so I ... You know , kind of shot him . You did what ? Where is he ? I don 't know . He took off in his car . Probably dead already . ( WHIMPERS ) Look , I was ... I was just looking out for you . Okay ? Do you know that it is pointless to kill in anger ? I was just thinking that . ( GRUNTS ) Make yourself useful . ( SINGING HYMN ) Don 't take no for an answer There 's no telling where we 've been Because people don 't understand , understand , understand People don 't understand People like me GARY : Well , I checked every ER in the city . Yeah . Seven people were admitted with gunshot wounds last night . But that 's not unusual . That 's only two more than average . Gary , ( SIGHS ) was Rosen one of the patients ? No . And I checked all the morgues , too . And they haven 't got his body , so that 's good . Unless they just haven 't found his body yet . Because dead bodies are good at hiding . I have to go to my mom 's room now . All right , Gary . The nurse keeps calling me . Just keep looking , okay ? Yeah , of course I will ... I should have never left Rosen . That was Rosen 's call . He sent you back here . All he wanted was justice for Dani . We both did . Now he 's seeing it through . I let her down . What happened ? Did she die ? No , Agent Bell . Oh , you woke up . Hey . Hey , Mom . KAT : Watch your step , there , princess . You know , I didn 't need you to come along with me . Believe me , it was not by choice . So , you really think this has something to do with Parish ? Five unexplained deaths , today of all days ? It has to be connected . We need to find out what killed them . Could it be noxious fumes ? This place smells like ass . Traces of methane , sulfur , carbon monoxide . It 's not enough to be toxic . I 'm really surprised you can hack it . One fart in an elevator , and you freak out . Hey ! What 's your problem ? Well , you almost got me killed . So there 's that . I 'm sorry about that . It was a complicated situation . You know , beyond that , it 's just this whole lack of loyalty thing pisses me off . You weren 't there , okay ? It went too far . You decided it went too far . If you 're gonna sign up for something stupid and dangerous , at least have the balls to see it through . Pick a side ! What ? ( SHUSHING ) Shh ! It 's a heartbeat . I hear someone . He 's scared . Whoa , whoa , it 's okay , it 's okay . KAT : Hey , we 're here to help . ( SOFTLY ) It 's okay . KAT : Were you here ? RACHEL : Do you wanna tell us what you saw ? Just tell us what 's wrong . ( SCREAMING ) ROSEN : Oh , this is ridiculous . Find Parish ... I have no idea where to look for him . Yes , you do . The bastard told you . Through Mitchell . I 'm gonna watch the world change with a God 's-eye view . God 's-eye view . I 'll watch the world change with a God 's-eye view . Where the hell is that ? ( CHURCH BELL CHIMING ) You 'll figure it out . You know who you can trust . ( TALKING INDISTINCTLY ) UTILITY WORKER : You gotta check that line . All right . He said the lights flash , leave five men dead . And the only survivor left is an Alpha . Or he was turned into an Alpha . And he seemed really freaked out when he made that noise . This had to be caused by a photo-stim . Photo-stim ? Well , that 'd be connected to the power lines , right ? Great , so we search a gazillion miles of ... KAT : Rachel , what is it ? It 's a grid protector . We put these in the power system to protect it from Parish and he put a photo-stim inside . We screwed ourselves . Parish played us . They could be all over the country , Rachel . Thanks for coming back . We need the help . Well , I made these things for Parish . So some of this in on me . All right , what set this thing off ? Was it a remote , a timer , what ? SKYLAR : No , the workers . They smashed it with a hammer . Men are idiots . Thanks . 8 : 18 . That 's when this thing is supposed to go off . 8 : 18 tonight . Evil , twisted son-of-a-bitch . Every light on this grid will flash . If you open the fridge , you get zapped . We 've got crews pulling them out , but we 're talking over a million in 19 different cities . They don 't have time . Man , it took these guys a month to put these things in . We just can 't take them out in a couple hours . You have to cut the power . It 's the only way . Pull the plug on the national grid until we can rip all these things out . Is that even possible with the time we have left ? I 'll get FEMA started on it . It won 't work in New York . The lines have dead-man switches . It means the systems keep going no matter what . That 's right . It 's a 9I11 thing . The system can 't shut down all at once . So how are we gonna get past this ? Me . All right , what do you need ? You have to transfer her right now . Not in 24 hours . You know , I 'm a Federal Agent . You have to do exactly what I say . I 'll see what I can do to hurry things along . Yeah , hurry things along ! Get on with it ! ROSEN : Gary ... Oh , Dr. Rosen . What are you doing here ? Gary , I need you ... I need help . I need to get my mom out . Bill says it 's not safe . I want to move her somewhere safe now . How is she doing ? Oh , she 's boring . She 's awake , but she 's just staring . Mom ! Gary , I 'm sorry I haven 't been here for you during all of this . I 've ... I 've been busy . Yeah , you were busy . You kidnapped someone , held him prisoner . No , I was ... That takes time . I was doing what I could to stop Stanton Parish . Yeah , to kill him . No , Gary . I was trying to protect people . No , Dr. Rosen , come on . Don 't lie to me . The same you way you were trying to protect your mother . You 're lying to me . You want to kill him . Because of Dani . ( PANTING ) God 's-eye view , Gary . What is that ? I don 't know what it means . I need your help . I imagine God 's-eye view , it has to be high up and it obviously has some significance for him . Oh , well , his family owned lots of boats . But they 're not very tall . They also owned some stables . They ... I don 't like horses . They look confused . There 's Shreve , Lamb and Harmon . What 's that ? Oh , they 're architects . And Stanton Parish is on the board of directors . And they ... Oh , oh , oh . They built the Empire State Building . DANI : God 's-eye view . Time to go . But tell him you won 't see him again , because you 're going to die . Gary . Working with you means so much to me . Seeing the world through your eyes has been very special . Oh , yeah , I know . I 'm amazing . Thank you . Yeah . Oh , wait , Dr. Rosen ? They 're looking for you . You know that . I ... I should call them . Because they can help you . No , Gary , please don 't , don 't do that . I have to ask you to keep this conversation just between the two of us . It 's very important . I don 't want any of you to have to ... To have to share in this . All of this . Do you understand ? Yeah , I understand . Thank you , Gary . I don 't know what I 'm gonna do when I find him . You stop him . But how ? How am I gonna stop him ? How does he heal ? How does he heal ? Yes . ( WHISPERS ) Okay . Yeah , he must have some sort of enhanced neural immune response system . It 's got to be voluntary . So that he can actually will his axons to regenerate . Yes . And I need to inhibit that response . Anti-coagulants . Methotrexate . So if he were injured severely enough ... He wouldn 't be able to heal . It would be done . This is a big hospital . Yes , okay ... It 'll have everything you need . God . What the hell am I doing ? I 've never stolen anything in my life . Aren 't you doing what 's right ? I don 't even know I believe in what I 'm doing anymore . Well , he does . He did what he thought was right and he is not giving up . Oh , Dani . Ever since you died , I ... I didn 't die . I was murdered . Oh , God , where am I ? Empire State Building . Where the hell am I ? Oh , I 'll never make it . I lost too much blood . Take the 1 to the Shuttle , transfer at Grand Central Station . Yes , Grand Central Station . HARKEN : NYPD flagged this off the BOLO . It 's definitely Rosen . And he 's not looking good . All right , what did he take ? Warfarin and heparin , which are blood-thinners . And then there 's MXT , which is a chemo drug . I don 't get it . I mean , he 's obviously hurt . Why didn 't he take pain killers ? There was Vicodin and Percocet in the cabinet . If he 's bleeding , blood-thinners aren 't gonna help him . Come on , Doc . What the hell are you doing ? He shouldn 't have done that . Dr. Rosen , he 's really angry about Dani dying . Just like I was angry about Anna . And he 's doing bad things . ( WHISPERING ) Go . Oh , that ... Mom ! You just spoke . That 's good . Help him . ( STAMMERING ) No , I can 't help him . I promised him that I wouldn 't ... I wouldn 't tell anyone if he was in trouble . But I ... What is that ? What are you ... What is this ? I 'm gonna stay here with you . Take care of you . What ... What is ... Go . Go ? I should go ? Go . Mom , I ... Yeah , okay . I 'll ... I 'll go . Oh , I 'm glad that you didn 't die , Mom . You close ? The clock 's ticking . We 've got maybe an hour . No , really ? Stop bugging us . Is that my laptop ? KAT : We needed your logic board . We 've gotta punch through the fail-safe , so we 're gonna kill all the power units . It died with honor . Out ! He 's so pretty , but so useless . He 's smarter than he looks . Ooh . Oh , I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to insult the man you love . I don 't love Hicks . Okay . Aren 't you almost done with that ? Yup . Guess it 's time to go save the world . I brought you here when you were eight years old , Dani . Your mother and I. We all took a tour of the station . In here ... I wanted to show you the constellations in the sky , but they 're backwards . The tour guide said it was a mistake . The painter , Paul Helleu , said that he painted them that way because he wanted people to see the stars on the other side of the sky . God 's-eye view . He 's not at the Empire State Building . He 's here . MAN : Thank you , sir . MAN ON PA SYSTEM : 7 : 15 express from Stamford is now arriving at Track 3 . All passengers ... MAN : FEMA has completed power-down in all Parish-affected cities . Local authorities are standing by for power-down in New York . KAT : So you 're sure this is gonna work ? I 'm never sure . Best case ? Yeah . Okay , worst case ? ( SIGHS ) Worst case , this thing sets off an explosive chain reaction that kills everybody we 're trying to save . Okay . Yeah . That 's worst . Okay , just do it ! MAN ON PA SYSTEM : Now arriving Track 101 on the lower level . ( PEOPLE TALKING ) ( ALL GROANING ) COP : Everyone , take it easy . ( PANTING ) You did it . Even after all that crap you pulled . You did it . We did it . Mostly I did it . Whatever . Yay , team . RACHEL : Midtown , uh , the power 's coming back on . It 's spreading north . KAT : Where else ? It 's just New York , as far as I can see . It 's working . It should be killing every transformer on the grid . Then where is the power coming from ? See ? Nothing to worry about . GARY : Oh , oh , Dr. Rosen ? Dr. Rosen . Dr. Rosen . Oh , no , Gary . Gary , what are you doing here ? Oh , you 're bleeding . That 's why I 'm here , Dr. Rosen . Is that why you took the medicine ? Gary , you have to leave right now . It 's very dangerous for you to be here . Yeah , I know it 's dangerous . You 're bleeding . Please don 't worry about me . You have to go . What ? I ... Right ... Right now . Go . Go . Please , I can ' allow you to be here . Parish is here . No , Doctor , no , I 'm not gonna go anywhere , Dr. Rosen . I get to make my own choices , you know that . Gary , I realize that ... No , you don 't realize , Dr. Rosen ! Okay , you 're bleeding . And you 're alone . Gary , I 'm fine . You 're not fine ! You help everyone on the team , like you 've helped me . And like my mom helps me . So now it 's fair , Dr. Rosen , that I help you . I 'm not gonna go anywhere . Okay ? It 's my turn . It 's my turn ! Okay . Yeah . That 's okay . It 's a back-up generator , somewhere , and it 's big . But not enough power to light up half the city . Those should be shut down , too . Anything with a solid-state trip switch . Unless it 's really old . Okay , well , whatever it is , we 've got 45 minutes to take it down . Rachel ... We 'll get everyone we 've got looking for that power source . Okay , thanks . That was Gary . He 's in Grand Central Station . He found Rosen . He thinks Parish is there , too . Maybe that 's why the Doc stole those drugs . He 's going after Parish . Come on , Gary , pick up ! Cameron ... Be safe , okay ? ( ELEVATOR DINGS ) Here , what else do you need to take with you ? For what ? What 's going on ? We 're evacuating . Now , these things are going to go off in 40 minutes . We 're moving the command center to the FEMA office in Tarrytown . We 're giving up ? No . No , we just need to be prepared for the aftermath . No . You know what these lights did to you last time . Rachel , they could kill you . I 'm not leaving Dr. Rosen . You are an infuriating woman . Because I want to do the right thing ? What about lying to me ? Was that the right thing ? Letting my op get ambushed , so you could kidnap some guy ? I have to be able to trust the woman that I 'm in love with . Don 't you get that ? Of course . Right . Wait a second . Did you say you 're in love with me ? Yeah , of course . Say it again . I love you . You need to come with me . I can 't . ( SIREN BLARING ) HARKEN : Listen , we find Parish , we stop this thing from happening . Okay , but why would Parish go to Grand Central Station ? Because with his freaky logic , he wants to be in the middle of everything when it goes down . Yeah , and make sure it happens . All right , so what 's in Grand Central Station ? Restaurants , the Apple Store ... Trains , tracks ... There 's a generator that 's designed to keep the trains running even if everything else in the city goes down . But that 's just for trains . No , that 's the M-42 . It 's from the ' 30s . It can put out enough power for half of Manhattan . How do you know this ? I don 't know . Somebody must have shown me . Maybe I took a tour . It 's under Grand Central somewhere . Okay , that 's our generator . All right , hold on . GARY : Dr. Rosen , I can 't get very good reception here . It 's all brick . I 'll have to go up to the main box . I 'll be able to see Parish on the security cameras . Gary , be careful . Yeah . Oh , Dr. Rosen . Don 't get shot again . MAN ON PA SYSTEM : Attention Metro-North customers . Lee Rosen ? Hmm ? 714 express train to New Haven , first stop in Stamford , is now available for boarding on Track 28 . STANTON : Lee , you have no idea how glad I am to see you alive . I 'd very much like you to stay that way . Stanton , where are you ? We need to talk , face to face . Soon . Something I have to finish first . No , no . You do not have to finish this . Haven 't you seen enough blood ? There won 't be any blood . It 'll be quick and clean . What ... What is this , your Final Solution ? A new beginning , for this small island at least . There is a storage closet 10 yards in front of you on the south wall . It 's a gray door . Go inside . The light has been disabled . You 're part of this future , Lee . So shut the door and close your eyes . MAN ON PA SYSTEM : From October 22nd through the 26th ... According to the briefing , that generator should be somewhere around here . You hear something , Rachel ? ( WHIRRING ) It 's 150 meters down , near the Lexington Avenue subway tunnel . Skylar . Bill , Parish wouldn 't leave the generator vulnerable . Yeah , I 'll cover them . You find Rosen . Come on , let 's go . Right . ( ELEVATOR DINGS ) So anybody have any gum ? Yeah . ( GUN COCKING ) ( ELEVATOR DINGS ) Everybody down ! Watch out ! Duck ! The M-42 is down that passageway . Yeah , awesome , we 'll just skip past the guys with the machine guns . Harken , break that ! ( BEEPS ) What is that ? ( ELEVATOR DINGS ) Go ! HARKEN : Get down . Rachel , you got it ! Go ! Hey . ( GRUNTING ) I need you to throw me . What ? I need you to throw me . ( WHISTLES ) ( GRUNTING ) ( GRUNTS ) It 's old . Really old . Old tech is tough . What did you expect ? Not this old . Let 's get started , then . This is one of the first platforms . I watched them build it . Helped pour the concrete . I put this in here when it was still wet . A 1913 Charles Barber Liberty Head , pure silver . I 'm surprised no one dug it out , certainly by now . But I 'm afraid we move through this world too quickly to notice things of true value . Shut up ! A firearm ? How crass . She was everything to me , Stanton . And you killed her . Yes , I did , for the greater good . My sweet Danielle was everything to me . You have no right to talk about her . Of course . My apologies . You 'll forgive me . I have to make my way to the main concourse . And you should get yourself to a safe place . Please , Lee . It 's important . This is what you want . What ? What do you want from me ? You don 't know ? ( CLOCK TICKING ) In a few minutes , I 'll be a mass murderer . I 'll have served my purpose . I can 't kill the damn thing ! Parish cross-wired and hardened every access point . I 'm gonna try to pull all the breakers . You 'll be the man they need . I want you to lead them . DANI : Kill him . He murdered me , Daddy . He murdered your little girl . Put him in the ground ! No , I 'm not gonna do it . I 'm not that man . Because Danielle wouldn 't have wanted it this way . She knew there was a better way . I couldn 't find it . Well , we should have looked harder . That 's what she would 've wanted . ( GUNSHOT ) Bill , Kat , help Skylar . Rosen and Parish were talking . I heard a gunshot . Hey , keep working on that . Which way ? He 's already started to heal , Doc . Now , I know you 've got those drugs . Let 's finish this ! No , Cameron . Shoot him up ! Kill this bastard and let 's get the hell out of here ! Cameron , if we kill him , what does that make us ? He killed Dani . I know . I know . But if we let him live , he 'll live with that pain forever . Don 't do it , Cameron . Be the man that she loved . Cam ? These aren 't all the breakers . There 's another panel on the opposite side of the building . Why would they split them ? Security reasons . So people like you and I can 't shut it down . Which is smart . We can 't kill the generator from here . The outgoing lines , they have to run through this panel somewhere . We 'll cut them . Shut down power to the rest of the city . That 's great , New York is saved . But what about the lights in the station ? They 're hard-wired into the generator , aren 't they ? We 're screwed , right ? Doc ! Hicks ! What happened ? Oh . It 's time . SKYLAR : Run ! KAT : Get out of the building ! ( WHIRRING ) ( FOLK MUSIC PLAYING ) Bill ? Bill ? Bill ? Dr. Rosen ? Dr. Rosen ? Dr. Rosen ?

 Previously on Touch ... I got a call from New York from a friend warning me about a man named Guillermo Ortiz , linked to multiple homicides around the world . All of his victims have Jake 's gift in one form or another . What ? That 's impossible . Avram , what are you doing here ? I came here to help you keep him safe . We managed to get Amelia back with her mother . Amelia ? - Oh , thank God . - I asked Lucy to take her daughter and disappear for a while , hide , spend some time with her . - They 'll be back soon enough . - Run . Run as fast as you can , okay ? Run ! Where 's the girl ? Is that a cipher ? What 's a cipher ? An algorithmic tool for performing encryption- - they 're used for sending and interpreting messages . Trevor ? - What is it ? - Lucy . Lucy ? Oh , no . How did she die ? All that came through the wire was that the body of Lucy Robbins was found in the front seat of her Wagoneer at the bottom of a ravine 15 miles west of Newberry Springs in the Mojave Desert . I left her . Oh , Martin , don 't do this . No , no , I left her . All of that work to bring the two of them back together again , and I left her . What the hell was I thinking ? There was no mention of Amelia Robbins . There wouldn 't be . As far as anybody else is concerned , Amelia is dead- - she died three years ago . She doesn 't exist . Wait a second . Y-You said they found one body . That means Amelia 's still out there . When I was in the desert , when they killed my mother , everything just went white and silent . Until I heard your voice . Thank you for guiding me here . You and your dad are all I have . But I can 't stay here . Not yet . As soon as your dad sees me , he 's gonna want to take me straight to the police . He thinks I 'm the proof he needs to end all of this . And maybe I am . But today is not the day for that . Today there 's something more important he has to do . The man that tried to kill you ? He 's still alive . Your father shot him , but it didn 't work . It didn 't stop him . He 's coming for us , Jake . He 's coming for you . We have to stop him first . Jake , you 're sweating . A fever . He must be getting close . Ten , 26 , 2,000 . Is that the number again ? Okay . Show this to your dad when you see him . And follow the numbers and you 'll find me . You 're still up . - You found him ? - Yeah , and the dad . Here 's the address . That 's what you wanted , isn 't it ? Yes . Just my plans are changing . So , can I get my money now ? Hey , just curious . What did the father do to you ? The boy is the powerful one . I 'm going to kill him . Why are you telling me this ? Because you will never tell a living soul . A sleep clinic . I can 't believe it 's come to this . It seemed like the perfect opportunity , since I 'll be working in Southern California anyway . Medication really hasn 't worked at all ? Nor the books , nor the meditation , nor the soundscape . That 's the price you pay for having an extraordinary mind . I 'm at wit 's end , Simon- - the problem 's reached a whole other level . I 'm sorry . I know you 're suffering . The clinic gets amazing results . We 're gonna miss you terribly , you know ? Me , too . I 'll be back before you blink . Come in , Chad . Make sure you 're careful with that . It 's a 50,000-year-old artifact in there . I think it 's that time . I love you so much . Hey . Bye , Lulu . Bye . Hey , buddy . You 're awake . Oh , my God , Jake , you 're burning up . Trevor ? Can you get me a cold cloth from the kitchen , please ? Okay . You know , don 't you ? Lucy 's gone . She was killed after we left her and Amelia . Here . - Thanks . - What 's wrong ? He 's burning up . Here . Jake . The cipher . Jake left me a new number . One , zero , two , six , two , zero , zero , zero . 10-26-2000- - that 's Jake 's birthday . - Can you get into BreakWire ? - Of course . I 'm gonna need to use your system to run down the number . - I 'll meet you there . - Okay . Find him . Jake ? Did you just try to say something ? What is it ? F-F ... F-Find ... him . Avram . Martin , it-it 's so terrible . I can 't believe she 's dead . - When I went to tell Jake , he spoke . - Spoke ? It 's the first time I 've ever heard his voice . What did he say ? " Find him . " Find him ? Find who ? I 'm guessing he 's talking about Guillermo Ortiz . He found another number on the cipher . Come , I 'll show you . Jake , Avram 's here . Most extraordinary . The number is changing . See these two numbers here with the dash ? - It 's like they 're connected . - Perhaps it refers to two of the 36 where Guillermo 's path intersects with another . That 's why I need to get to BreakWire . I need to get these numbers into their system , see where they lead us . You 're sure you don 't mind taking care of Jake a little longer ? Yes , of course- - you go , Martin Bohm . - We 'll be fine . - Thank you , Avram . Buddy , I 'll be back in a little while . Less than 12 hours ago , I was informed of some troubling developments within an Aster Corps subsidiary . I have ordered an internal investigation to culminate in full accountability . And believe me when I say , we will deal with those found responsible . I 'd like to assure our shareholders that no bad practices performed via ... Hello . Good morning , Mr. Norburg . This is the executive assistant to Nicole Farington at Aster Corps . I don 't know if you 've been watching the news ... Yeah , yeah . I was actually just watching her press conference now . Ms. Farington would like to meet with you . This morning if possible . We 'll come to you . - How did you get my number ? - We 'll see you in an hour . ... misallocated funds , unethical testing , unauthorized and off-the-books facilities , as well as dangerous and unsound invest ... Trevor . I think this one 's gonna lead us to Guillermo Ortiz . Why do you think that ? Because after you left , Jake spoke for the very first time . Martin , that 's amazing . Immediately his fever disappeared , he started working on the cipher . That 's when he gave me the number . This is the first number he 's ever given me that 's had a dash in it . Why do you think it will lead us to Guillermo ? Because he said , " Find him . " Look , Guillermo wanted to kill Jake because he was one of the 36 . So he 'd want to kill Amelia , too , right ? Martin , you shot him off the roof of this building at point-blank range . I doubt he 's even alive . I know he is . I can feel it . Oh , we have a hit . L.A. County Morgue . All right , your car or mine ? I 'll take care of this , you got a job to do . Yeah . Slow news day . No such thing . You look like you could use a friend today , Martin . Don 't fight me on this , okay ? Yeah . Mr. Ortiz , the rent 's due . Yes ? Rent 's due at noon if you are planning on staying another night . I 'll be leaving . I found the one I was looking for . What 's that smell ? What have you been doing in there ? Is there anything else ? Stop by the office if you want your security deposit back . That 's green . A green leaf . That 's orange . An orange goldfish . That 's purple ... Hello . Hello , darling . It 's me . Nell . Are you in Los Angeles ? Not yet . I was bumped . Uh , now the artifact is gonna be arriving before I do . Oh , no , I 'm so sorry . Um , can you call the university for me and arrange for someone to retrieve it from the airport ? My damn phone has stopped working . Yeah . Of course . No problem . Okay . Thank you . What are you doing ? I am reading Colors to Lulu . Mm . - Where are you ? - Chicago . And what do you see ? I see an airport ... uh , businesspeople ... families ... Yeah , but what do you see ? I see smoke rising from tipis . Warriors on horseback . Young boys filling water vessels at a brook 30 meters east . And beyond that , women grinding corn at the stone . A Potawatomi Indian village . It never ceases to amaze me . You have an incredible gift , Nell . Hmm . Or a curse . I wonder sometimes if the insomnia doesn 't just come with the package . Nothing that the Sleep Assessment Center can 't cure . Boarding all seats- - flight 1026 to Los Angeles . They 're calling my flight . Kiss Lulu for me . - I will . I love you . - I love you . All right . Hmm . The cipher seems to have its own internal mechanics ... which arrive at a number once the information is dialed in . However ... how do you know what information to dial in ? And why would you change the numbers that you were given ? Ha-ha . Unless ... unless the numbers find you . They speak to you , and you have no choice but to follow . Baruch HaShem . Another map , Jake . You will know this city quite well after today , yes ? What is it that you 're looking for , my boy ? 2013 ... 1026 . Bus to the airport ... What ... does that mean ? Oh , no , no , no , no , no . W-We will leave the detective work to your father , my boy . You see , I ... No , I-I have been entrusted ... Jake , please . My-My boy , I ... Wait . - Journalists , huh ? - Yeah . We 're doing a story on morgue protocols from intake to autopsy . Too bad . I was hoping you 'd be kin . This one 's got " unclaimed " written all over it . What makes you say that ? Well , you know , you get a feel for these things . I mean , you know , the body 's been here for eight hours , we still don 't have a positive I.D. Why 'd you pick this guy , anyway ? Friend of mine at LAPD thought it 'd be an interesting case . Huh , well , every body tells a story , right ? 2013-1026 . Here 's your guy . Thank you . Yeah . Do you know who he is ? No . But did you see the way his throat was slit ? Jake ! Please wait . Jake ... Amelia . You 're alive . We could have met at my office , but I felt that it was better for us to speak privately . The announcement I made yesterday was just the tip of the iceberg . There are rumors of serious wrongdoings within the company . Really ? At Aster Corps ? Of all places . If we don 't fix this , the press or police will . That missing girl out there could point the finger at any one of us . It is imperative that blame for these terrible deeds falls on the person who is responsible . That person , as I see it , is Tony Rigby . Your former partner ? He 's gone off the grid . I 'm looking for him . Now , have you had any contact with him ? He works for you . You find him . We have the same agenda , Mr. Norburg . If you find him , I am asking you to bring him to me and I will take care of the rest . You know , I bet on the wrong horse . I put my money on Rigby . I should 've put it on you . I would like you to consider coming back to work for us . Hey , you got to be joking . The work we 're doing at the sleep clinic is ... extraordinary . A sleep clinic ? Rigby didn 't tell you ? You had one . We have six . And a seventh is arriving today . You will be amazed at what you see . You sure you 're up to this , Martin ? I don 't have a choice . Lucy wasn 't supposed to die . Her death threw everything out of balance . Jake is using us to try and put it right . We don 't have a choice . Avram ? Martin , listen , I 'm-I 'm on a , on a bus . You 're where ? On a bus t-to the airport . Where is Jake ? He 's fine , he 's fine . He 's with me . He just ... flew out the door . But-but , Martin ... he led me to her . To Amelia . She 's alive ? Yes . And well . They found each other , Martin . She says that today you must find Guillermo , because if you do not , innocent people will die . Meantime , they will be safe with me . Okay , fine . Avram , please , don 't let them out of your sight . Of course . Of course . Thank you . Jake led Avram to Amelia . - She 's alive . - Oh , thank God . Not a lot of info . Uh , the body was found in a Dumpster by a hotel , no I.D. Do you have an address on the hotel ? Yeah . Uh , 1675th Street . Thank you very much . Come on . My mom gave that to me . I didn 't know when , but I knew she was coming for me . Next stop- - International Terminal . That 's our stop . What now , my boy ? Welcome to the Los Angeles Airport . The white zone is for the immediate loading and unloading of passengers only . Flight 1026 . The last four numbers . Wait ! I 'm coming ! Excuse me , we 're looking for the manager of the hotel . What can I do for you ? Looking for a man- - Guillermo Ortiz . Early 30s , dark complexion , dark hair , speaks with a European accent . Checked in about a week ago . Strange guy . Pretty beat up , too . He was checking out today . But I haven 't seen him . You mean he 's still here ? As far as I know . Sir , we 're working undercover with U.S. Customs . We 're gonna need to see his room . Do you have a warrant ? U.S. Customs doesn 't require a warrant . Do we have a problem ? Sir , do we have a problem ? Uh , no . No . This way . Why would the cipher lead us here ? At the time Jake worked the cipher , there were 429 possible outcomes for this moment . As the event gets closer , the possibilities narrow , eventually collapsing into one . That 's it . The numbers . This crate must be very important . Why ? Wha-What is it , my boy ? Oh . I-I need to call ur father . He should know about this . Oh , of course . No service . Don 't move , please . I must get a better signal . Don 't move . Dr. Nell Plimpton . We must find her . Manager ! This is blood . How long 's this stain been here ? I don 't know . It wasn 't there when I rented the room . Do you have any idea where this man might 've gone ? He said something about finding someone he was looking for . You need to call the police now . Now . Martin , what do you make of this ? Avram , where are you ? Baggage Claim C , international terminal . I thought you should know . Jake has drawn something . A line of patterns , like ancient writing , or ... - Hieroglyphics ? - You know about these ? - I 'm looking at them now . I 'm in the room Guillermo rented . - Well , what do they mean ? - I don 't know yet . Avram , I want you to wait for me . I 'm on my way . Let 's go . Yeah , my phone 's working . Oh ! Pardon . So they picked up the crate already ? Okay , I 'll grab a cab . Bye . Hi . St. Matthew 's University , please , archaeology department . Hey , what do you think ... ? Jake ? Oh , dear . Jake ? ! Amelia ? ! Children ! Children ! We wanted to make the environment warm and comforting . It 's like a Four Seasons Hotel . From the waffle slippers to the turndown service . When the subjects are relaxed , the results are much more reliable . Why am I telling you this ? You 're the expert . I 'm saving the best for last . There 's a phonetics lab , six supercomputers , and from my understanding , the world 's first ... Quantum computer . It 's brilliant . They all have sleeping problems . Well , if the problem gets bad enough , their desperation makes a targeted marketing campaign quite effective . They literally come to us . - And you scan their brain waves while they 're sleeping . - Mm-hmm . I don 't know why I didn 't think of this . The results we 've been getting are amazing . It 's yielded an almost 90-digit sequence that is unheard of . The God sequence . If they think it or dream it , then you 'll know about it . That is , if you decide to come on board with us . Yeah . I 'm in . Welcome home , Calvin . Oh , there 's one other thing . Forgive me . I 'm still catching up . There was a name that came up in our New York database , a Martin Bohm , Baum . Do you know where I might find him ? I 'm sorry . I can 't help you . Well , that 's that . Let 's get to work . _ Yeah , I 'm here . Sure . I 'm coming around to the freight elevator now . Room 1026 , right ? Hey , Trevor , did you find something ? Those hieroglyphs- - a British archaeologist just published a paper on them . They 're from a cave wall 50,000 years old . She believes she 's discovered the earliest organized number system . Where is she ? London . A Dr. Nell Plimpton . Teaches at King 's College . Have you got a number ? Here you go . Hello . Hi , my name is Martin Bishop . I 'm looking for Dr. Nell Plimpton . Is she there , please ? Nell ? No . She 's , uh , she 's in Los Angeles . This is her husband . Is there something I can help you with ? She 's in Los Angeles . Hello ... Yes , I 'm-I 'm sorry . I 'm her driver . I was supposed to pick her up at the airport . Somehow I missed her . I 'm afraid she got a cab . - Do you know the name of hotel she 's staying at ? - Her driver ? Yes . Please , sir , I could , I could lose my job . She 's going to St. Matthew University . - The archaeology department . - St. Matthew . Thank you very much . Martin ! Avram , change of plans . It looks like the hieroglyphs were the key to everything . I 'm on my way to St. Matthew 's University . Martin , listen , they 're gone . - Jake and Amelia , I lost them . - What ? ! I just turned around for one minute , and they took off . I 've searched every inch of this area . They , they must 've followed the crate . It had Jake 's numbers on it . Wait . I think I know where they 've gone . - You do ? - Yes , the university . Look , catch a cab back to the house just in case they show up there . I 'll get back to you as soon as I can . There it is . Whoa . They 're numbers , aren 't they ? Thank you . He 's here . - Are you Dr. Plimpton ? - Yes , correct . - Welcome to our place . Good to see you . - Thank you , thank you . - Yeah . - Hi , nice to meet you . - And then we have the lab all set up for you . - Oh ... I haven 't even checked in yet . I just wanted to make sure that the artifact arrived safely . - Good luck . - Okay . - It 's this way ? - Yeah , right down here . - 1026 . Yeah . - Excellent . Thanks . Nell Plimpton ? Excuse me ? Who are you ? What do you want from me ? Help ! Shh . Are you gonna kill me ? Yes . But not until he arrives . We 'll wait . Jake ? She 's not the one . She 's not the one . Help ! Help me ! Help me ! Jake ? Amelia ? Jake ? Help me ! There 's a man . He 's got a knife . - He 's trying to kill me . - Where ? He 's down the corridor towards the back . I 'm looking for two children ; have you seen them ? - No . - Get out of the building . Get help now . 911 . What 's your emergency ? I 'm in the archaeology building at St. Matthew 's University . A man has just tried to kill a woman . He 's armed and dangerous . Please send officers immediately . It 's over . The killing 's over . No , no . No ! Your son- - he was right . Today I 'm gonna rid the world of one more of the 36 . I was so close . Forgive me , Father , but I never found the nest of seven . No ! Jake , it 's all right . He can 't hurt you anymore . Jake , no , Jake , stop . Jake . Amelia . Oh , I 'm sorry ... I am so sorry about your mom . Bishop , you spell it like it sounds ? Yeah , B-I-S-H-O-P . You know , I 'm still not , uh , I 'm not really clear what brought you down here to begin with . I-I told you , my son and his friend , they were ... they were exploring . They got away from me and they ended up down here . So you came down here looking for your son , and that 's when you ran into the woman and called 911 . Yes . What can you tell me about the deceased ? Not much . I mean , he attacked me . He came out of nowhere . You know , this whole thing is starting to smell a little bit weird to me . It 's an awful lot of people wandering around an archaeology building for a Sunday afternoon . Detective , this has been very traumatic for me and for my son . I would really like to get him home . So if you don 't have any more questions , please . You get some rest , and I need to see you at the station tomorrow . - 12 : 00 noon okay ? - Yes . 12 : 00 noon . Thank you . He just had a knife to my throat , and then there was a moment ... - Excuse me . I 'm sorry to interrupt . - Are you Dr. Plimpton ? - Yes . I 'm glad you 're okay . Thank you . Yeah . Come on , kids , let 's go . - Jake ... - It 's all right . My son doesn 't talk . But I think he wants to show you something . Do you mind ? Sure . We are the authors of our own destinies , the pioneers of our lives . The numbers . You deciphered the code . And yet , our world is made of patterns . My son has a gift with numbers . Eternal truths that appear and repeat , over and over , across the millennia . For it 's only by standing on the shoulders of the past that we can truly gaze into the future . Thanks again , Avram . For what , losing your son ? If Jake and Amelia hadn 't left the airport this afternoon , an innocent woman would be dead and Guillermo Ortiz would be hunting down his next victim . No , today went exactly as it was supposed to . As with all things Jake , sometimes the shortest distance between two points can be a very circuitous route . Look at those two . Perhaps being so close to another has inspired Jake to find his voice . Avram , before Guillermo died , he said something about " the nest of seven . " Do you have any idea what that could mean ? Who can explain the ravings of a madman ? Yeah . - Good night , Martin Bohm . - Good night , Avram . Hey , guys . Amelia , we 're gonna have to find your father , okay ? You can look for him . But I don 't think you 'll find him . Well , why do you say that ? Sometimes I know things . I don 't know why . Right . Um ... I-I put some things out for you on your bed . If there 's anything else you need , all you have to do is knock on my door , okay ? We 'll finish this game tomorrow . Good night . Good night . Thank you , Jake , for leading us to her . She 's been through a lot . She 's part of our family now , okay ?

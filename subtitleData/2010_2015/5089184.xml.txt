 * * * We have a evo active alert . * * * Whoa , whoa , whoa ... ♪ ♪ * * * something . Hold it . This could get interesting . Whoa-oa-oa ! Or it could get messy . Let 's save the kid 's tail . Aah ! Okay , look , so , maybe I helped blow up your cousin on prom night , but you can 't still be upset . Your brain is , like , the size of a walnut . Ugh ! Bobo ! Yes ! Set cannon to " barbecue . " What 's gonna happen ? Is there nitroglycerine in there ? Nope , just alfalfa . Bunnies love alfalfa . Yeah , and Rexes love smacking down evo conejos . So let 's go ! Violence is always a last resort . He 's all yours , gents . We 're not hitting anything . And did you just say " gents " ? Let 's not argue . Besides , I 've got doughnuts for everyone . Whoa . Way to go , Bobo . ♪ So make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way ♪ ♪ we 're gonna have fun tonight ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ ♪ so make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ Even though it 's a big one , this evo is a simple creature with simple needs . Its behavior has no rational explanation . We 're going to have to do more tests . Forget the rabbit , doc . The monkey is the one who needs the testing . Bobo ? What do you mean ? Um , he was thoughtful , instead of destructive . - And come on , doughnuts ? - Bobo loves doughnuts . Yeah , but he doesn 't share doughnuts ever . And he cleaned up his language . He even cleaned up his toenails . He hasn 't blown anything up all day . So you 're alarmed because Bobo was acting like a responsible member of this organization ? Say that sentence out loud again , think about how weird it sounds . Don 't be so quick to judge . Bobo has been through a lot in his life . We 're all affected by the events of our past . What past ? You mean , no one ever told you ? Before he went evo , Bobo was a helper animal , trained to entertain sick children by an eccentric philanthropist . Bobo ? Bobo , our Bobo ? You 're kidding . Far from it . And once in a rare while , I think his former behaviors rise to the surface . I 've never really had time to study it , but if it means there are days I don 't find monkey hair in my coffee , I roll with it . You can roll all you want . I got to room with him . Rex , I really need to figure this rabbit out , so if you 've got a problem with Bobo , take it up with him . Oh , I plan to . Ahh ! That should do it , gents . Does anyone have a moist towelette ? You were the one who ruined terrain buster last month . Hence my compulsion to repair it . Let 's not hold on to our frustrations so tightly . They will cause nothing but agony . Okay , Poker is Bobo . Ha ha ! Read ' em and weep . Full house , baby . All 's fair in love and cards . Well played , agent Jackson . Hmm . He 's not himself , Six . It 's driving me crazy . Haven 't you noticed ? Considering I 've been asleep until 3 seconds ago , no . Oh , come on . It 's so obvious that he 's ... Wait . You sleep in your suit ? Okay , that 's weird , too , but one thing at a time . You 're the guy I depend on to assume the worst . That 's only when it comes to you . What if it 's nanite possession or White Knight mind control ? I wouldn 't put it past him . Have you ever considered that Bobo might just be turning over a new leaf ? Well , he could turn over a whole tree . He 'd still be Bobo , and I 'm gonna prove it . Hey ! Guess what day it is . - Thursday ? - No . It 's national party for no reason day ! Miss , you look lost . Allow me to escort you to the nearest exit pod . That 's it ! The real Bobo would never turn down a stupid excuse for an unauthorized party . You 're not Bobo . Now fess up or get messed up . Oh . Now , who do you think is gonna tidy that up ? Looks like you ripped your poster there . Bobo ! I ... I didn 't mean to ... What ? ! What ? ! Don 't mind me , chief . Seemed to have lost my head . Lost my head . Lost my ... I knew you weren 't you . Of course I 'm me . Who else would I be ? Game over , fake Bobo . Who sent you ? Van Kleiss ? Zag-RS ? Where is Bobo ? Uh ... Careful with the merchandise , you hairless ape . You 'll muck up my mainframe . Bobo ? ! Are you okay ? Where are you ? Were you kidnapped ? Right now , I 'm ticked off . Let go of my slightly less-handsome twin before you blow everything . Blow everything ? Look , Rex , I ain 't been taken ... I went . Every once in a while , a monkey needs ... Bobo time ... alone . That little guy you 're smacking around is how I get it . Been using it for years as a decoy . This thing is nothing like you . Most people don 't notice . If I ain 't lighting them on fire , they could care less . But what the heck does " Bobo time " mean ? Monster trucks in Arkansas ? A Vegas weekend ? Don 't get your knuckles in a knot . It ain 't like that . Then tell me what it is like . It ... it 's personal . You got to trust me on this one . Just keep my cover till I get back , all right ? Rex , when you fought that evo rabbit , did you notice ... Uh , I 'll ... Come back later . Doc ? Wait I ... I hate you . You can kick my butt later , instead of talking to it , kid , but I got to go . You got my back or not ? I got your back . So , has our imbroglio been satisfactorily resolved ? Resolved ? Yes . Satisfactorily ? No . If you 're gonna be convincing as Bobo , we need to make some serious changes to that personality of yours . He 's under control ? Six ! You got too close . Did I ? Did you figure him out ? Not him , her . And she 's starving ' cause she 's about to give birth . To what ... Exactly ? I 'm not certain I understand my assigned duties . Hold up . What 's the skinny , Minnie ? Better . Here . I can eat it , but you 're gonna have to drain my food tanks . It 's not for lunch . Try to think like a Bobo , you dodo . Bad is good . Good is bad . And use your feet . Okay , buddy boy , start it up . I think I caused that . Now we 're talking . You sure about this ? Does White Knight drink milk ? Whoa ! Hey , Bobo , we like the new can 't-win-a-hand you . Want to play again tonight ? Sounds like a plan , Stan . I 'll bring the eats ? Bring whatever you want ... Especially your money . I feel so wrong . Are you kidding me ? The real Bobo would have snatched their tighty-whities , too . And that 's a wrap . Bobo 's rep is back to tarnished . We 're in lockdown , where nothing bad can happen , and I 'm no longer embarrassed to hang with you . I 'm an awesome friend . I don 't know . I just know I was happier doing what I was programmed to do . Ugh . Way to make a guy feel guilty . Since we 're in lockdown , I ... I guess there 's no harm in putting you back . Rex , we need you in the petting zoo now . Qué wha ? It 's an Easter nightmare . One wasn 't enough , doc ? You made more ? Not us ... Her . Aah ! And let me guess ... they hate me as much as she does . Bobo , don 't just stand there , help Rex . Help . Helping is good . But good is bad . But Rex is my friend . And it ... oh , boy . Okay , they 're just adorable puffballs of death , right ? Bobo , score more alfalfa and get them to chill ! Hey , furballs ... Come to mama ! - Bobo , are you insane ? - She 's protecting her young . Get her away from Rex . Bad is good is bad is good . I 'm helping my friend ! No ! Aah ! This is ... aah ! Ridiculous ! I can 't die this way . Six would never let me live it down . Hyah ! Today , the squeak will inherit the earth ! Oh , no . This is my best worst yet . I am the worst friend ever . Knight 's popping a vessel . Was it the monkey or the boy ? Put it this way ... if we don 't get Bobo under control immediately , Knight may have a monkey-skin rug in his office by tomorrow morning . Wee-hee-hee ! Wee ! What are you doing ? Seeing ... If the monkey 's paw is truly more powerful than the ... Rabbit 's foot . If we don 't stop this now , Bobo , the real Bobo 's gonna be busted . Good is bad , and bad is good . Time to hit reset , chum . Not again . Rex , why haven 't you shut this down ? Hyah ! I 'm on it . Ugh ! Just a little miscommunication , really . Bobo and I are ... Bobo , no ! Freedom ! Did I mention that I hate that monkey ? Many times . H ... hilarious ! Be happy , Rex . This is the prank of a lifetime . The ultimate Bobo ... Sorry to poop on your party , pal , but that 's what I do . So , we meet again ... For the last time . Whatever floats your boat . Is there a gas leak in here ? What the heck 's happening ? Haven 't the slightest . Bobo ? Ugh ! Whoa ! Aah ! Ugh ! Couldn 't leave well enough alone , could you ? I was trying to help , I swear . Aah . Aah ! That 's what you get for being " helpful . " Follow my lead , and maybe we get out of this . You focus on Bugsy . I got ... Me . Time to get terminated , Faux-Bo . Bring it , banana sack . Aaah ! Thanks , Blinky . I owe you one . Ugh ! Hyah ! Forgot I made him so good . Follow me , people . We 'll sing the body electrical and crash the Christmas day parade . I 'm not ... Gonna make it ! I am the evo king ! Not on your artificial life , you beautiful hunk of junk . Aah ! Come on , Fluffy , let 's finish it . Huh ? Just back away from the bunnies , Rex , slowly . All these memories like ... Tears in rain . Tears in rain . I 'll miss you , buddy . What is going on here ? If you 'll give me a sec ... Uh ... I was out for my ... Morning constitutional , jogging on the roof , when I was kidnapped ... By an evil mastermind , who I had an unfortunate business relationship with before I came to work for you guys . Out for revenge , he replaced me with an evil robot who was programmed to hurt those closest to me ... you wonderful , wonderful people . Uh ... Luckily , I ate through my handcuffs , I shoved his mints where the sun don 't shine , and made it here just in time to save your bacon . This guy must be good . We 'll check into it . Good job containing the security breach , monkey . You do realize you 're building me a new robot , right ? If you tell me where you really were . Fine . I was at a family reunion . Right . Like I 'd believe that . Fine . Don 't tell me . I don 't want to know . But if you 're not going to tell me what you were really doing , at least tell me your origin story . Or are you actually a helper monkey / evil sidekick ? That I can tell you , and I swear on my back hair every word is true . It started with a dude in a purple hat .

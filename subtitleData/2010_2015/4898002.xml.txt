 795 ) } Vash is the mastermind ? Trigun Movie : Badlands Rumble Alert ! Alert ! We 've received a tip on a bank robbery ! Eh ? Good luck with that . { Then try hard . } contact me . This isn 't the typical robber . It 's him ! Gasback ! What ? ! I 'm counting on you for backup . two squads ! { this line doesn 't make sense ? } I 'm sending an entire platoon your way ! It 's a rat race ! the { way of the } world is really a rat race . Hey ! Their things belong to us . Our things belong to them . Everyone thinks only of their own share . Isn 't that right ? That 's not true ! Everyone here works — You 're the same . It just so happens that in your village there 's enough to go around . You just haven 't realized that your wealth is stolen from others . I 'm not blaming you . didn 't I ? The { way of the } world is a rat race . the old and the young . Anyone can participate in it ! My nose ... Cain . I think you should really do something about that thieving nature of yours . Stealing behind other people 's backs is no good . It doesn 't suit me . And swindling is out of the question . That 's not something a human should do . a proper profession is even more taboo . Why ? You can 't see the faces of the people you steal from . right ? It 's because we 're face-to-face that this is a rat race . it 's good to go ! Yeah ! It 's over . it was certain that not even a single scrap would be left behind . Let 's think of it in a different way . at least we 'll keep our lives . Cheer up . if it was the Humanoid Typhoon Vash the Stampede instead ... not even a single hair from our heads would be left . You 're right . I see . It 's better than being confronted by that guy . I 'm glad it 's Gasback ... The last ... one ... That 's truly a nice expression . I 'm satisfied . you done yet ? This is the last one ! It 's time for us to part . but I 'll be pulling out . Gasback . was it ? That was the final volley for you and your work . I can 't keep up with you ! Like an idiot you keep aiming for big things and then sink all of the cash you earn into the next big operation ! You 'd do that this time too ! That 's what robbers live for . What would be the point if robbers didn 't take robbery seriously ! ? Quit joking around . If you 'd rather take things seriously then why become a robber ? That 's right ! I see . You 've roused these two dimwits . We want to live an easy and luxurious life . Today 's your last day as the leader of this operation ! Is that so ? I 've had enough of your weak ambitions too . Would you be surprised if I said that we tipped off the authorities for tonight 's job ? we 'll take the cash . And we 'll blow your corpse away cleanly too ! Do you intend to take me out on your own — Whoops . I didn 't think you 'd notice . There 's no way I could take you unarmed . { armed ? } Gasback . not mine . { the one who 'll end is you . } Don 't act tough . Then go ahead and do it . Don 't shoot ! You 'll hit him ! but it seems luck is on my side ! Calm down ? I am calm . I 'll just break your head open in one shot ! Stop it ... I was wrong ... Forgive me ! You 've done the one thing you shouldn 't have . You 've tarnished the robbery ! My robbery ! It 's a shame . I won 't be able to see the face I stole your life from ! Ahhh ! My donuts ! move away from there ! Hurry ! My donuts ... You 're so mean ! I was saving the best one for last ! I can 't eat them like this ! Do you wanna die ? Quit moving around . and I got caught up in this whole mess ! You should have tied me up ! Were you dropped on the head as a child or something ? Or are you naturally like this ? Or were you — compensate me for these ! Compensation — Shut up ! If you 're gonna interfere ... What 's with you ? you idiot ! compensation ! It can 't be ... Food grudges are scary . The Japanese sure had it right . Shut up . I don 't know what I stole from you ... It 's Vash the Stampede ! Ah ! Save me ! Shut up ! you 'll go first ! Compensation ... Could you have be the one that 's been disrupting me from the beginning ? Just what are you trying to do ? Why is it your business to save either me or them ? Well you see .. Isn 't living better ? That 's not something I would think the Humanoid Typhoon would say . well it isn 't really ... I 'm not impressed . is to rebel against the way of the world . right ? One can 't take back the dice once cast . Huh ? You 've cast another 's dice . I hope you don 't regret it . See ya . Isn 't that overdoing it ? Could you have ... ? Huh ? Do you mean the Plant ? It seems it 's all right . look . This is bad ! Adios . I 'm the mastermind ? ! The red coat fluttering in the blistering sand turning towns into ash . The Devil 's envoy . Vash the Stampede . known as the Humanoid Typhoon . Voztot 's the same as ever . but now he 's got a $ $ 100 million bounty on his head . This morning it went up to 300 million . 300 million ? ! I 'd like to aim for that too . you 'd come back as just a head . What ? You can 't do it either . I wouldn 't try in the first place . what bad taste . the man who rebuilt Macca City 's Plant twenty years ago ... To erect a statue of yourself ... Seems like he 'd be a difficult guy to talk to . It 's all right ! We 've brought presents ! And they 're a bit bigger than usual ! Hey ladies ! wanna get some drinks ? { steroptyoical pick up line } The kind with alcohol . We 're fine . And we 're busy . wait up . Just for a little bit ? Come with us . Even the big one . Okay ? { Right ? } it broke off again . what are you doing ? I 'm so sorry . That was quite rude of me { right off the bat } . Why are there bounty hunters gathered here ? Haven 't you seen this ? This is ? Gasback . There are rumors of him targeting this city . Mr. Kepler is gathering bodyguards . Meryl ? Now I get why the main office suddenly sent us out to confirm the insurance contract . That statue 's insured for $ $ 5 billion ! 5 billion ? ! Our Bernadelli insurance agency is in grave danger ! You tricked me ! It 's over . Leave . 75 cents . Tomaku — Hey . Tomakun for me . Please observe the order of the line . Make it quick . 200 onku . pay first ! Tomakun and sausage . There 's been so many mannerless pigs lately . Gasback just doesn 't die . Isn 't he like an old man ? The $ $ 300 million bounty should be easy to get . { * why is this star here } { also wasn 't it million earlier ? or was that vash } Is that so ? Don 't let your guard down or the the tables will turn on you . Cowards wavering in the wind might as well leave right now . bro ? Are you ... a woman ? Let me see your face ... Don 't touch me . I found a little birdie in this dump ! are you alone ? Wanna eat together ? Move ! come here ! I found her first ! Won 't you travel with me ? It 'll be fun ! lady ? she 's a beauty . Don 't touch me . Don 't touch me . Eh ? What did you say ? Seems like he 's unwelcome . How pitiful ! Don 't touch me " ? are you guys virgins ? Well this is quite the authoritative woman . I love women like you . The way you force people to listen to you — It isn 't good manners to hold a knife inside a ship . Move . you bitch ! He got his ass kicked twice now ! woman ! You haven 't been kicked around enough yet ? I won 't listen to your bragging ! This girl 's got a bad habit with her legs . Nice . Go around and we 'll hold her down . before ... right ? Didn 't you drop it around here ? but I misplaced my knife . Can I borrow yours ? I fucking hate idiots like you . I 'll kill you ! There it is ! I found it ! This is it ! right ? Just let me borrow it for a bit . Now then ... let 's try out a bit of this toma . Is that okay ? No . come on . So I can 't have my snack ? Here . idiot . Yes ? You fucking moron ! don 't ! I was wrong ! I apologize . move ! Don 't say that — like this ! Let go of me you bastard ! okay ? just let go ! thanks ! What an idiot . Twice too . But did you see that ? I did . I won 't forgive either of you . Especially the woman ! He 's finally snapped . This isn 't a joke ! Idiot ! Don 't touch me ? I 'll make you regret it ! I 'm going to torture you . I won 't forgive you . I 'll make you cry your eyes out . Do you know what it means to piss me off ? It means I 'll rob you of all your freedom ! Kneel . Kneel ! I 've changed my mind ! You mustn 't make a fuss . right ? Please stop applauding . It makes me feel weird . Those guys shot their guns ! isn 't it ? We 've got to observe the rules ! well let 's treat them with a forgiving heart ... You can 't go against it either . I can 't stand to be grouped with thugs like you ! Here ! Those are your guns ! Here ! That 's your food and your water ! Be grateful ! And this is to remember us by ! we 'll come pick up your remains ! this is where we part . It 's pretty ostentatious . The guards look dangerous but gorgeous ! I 've kept you waiting . I am Kepler . yes ! I apologize for coming at this busy time . You 're from the insurance company ? we are . But first ... It 's nothing special ... what are you do — It 's fine . There is no danger . I see . You may go . I apologize . We 're in a high state of alert right now . Still frozen . Revise the contract ? Why ? you see ... I should have given you time to explain the contents and decide on the amount . Do you doubt my sincerity ? and we must confirm that there are no mistakes before its completion ... That 's the symbol of this town . You can 't put a price on that . it 's wonderful ! Then there shouldn 't be any problems ! but I 'd actually like to insure the Plant too . It 's because of that Plant that the townspeople and I can make a living . { continue here } Won 't the money keep coming in even if you don 't do anything ? I 'm so sorry ! Insuring the Plant is impossible . We can 't possibly cover damage insurance . And our handling ... I get it . But the coverage amount for the statue must remain the same ! is it okay not to assess it ? Our company is the strongest one in the business . It was determined that 5 billion be the correct amount . There 's nothing we can do at this point . I see ... but rather to guard it against the possibility of us having to pay for it . But ... how could a thing that big get stolen ? It 's not just a question of whether or not it gets stolen . If Gasback appears here ... 5 billion ! Milly ! We 've got no choice but to defend it . that is . Roger ! Hey there ! let 's talk ! We didn 't talk at all inside the ship ! I wanna know more about you ! Nope . There 's nothing to talk about . You 're so cold . So where are you from ? What 's your name ? First time in this town ? so why are you following me ? Because I feel that fate brought us together . Huh ? Didn 't you feel it ? You 're getting on my nerves . I felt it on the back of my neck like whoa ! Surely you felt it too . Like this ... Cut it out ! tell me your name ! Are you all right ? Its an allergic reaction ! This is what happens when idiots like you touch me ! Even a good guy like me ? Good ? All men are the same ! Then you shouldn 't have come to this town . It 's full of idiotic male bounty hunters . Don 't lump me in with those guys . This isn 't inside a Sand Steamer . But I really want to know your name . I 'll kill you ! Meryl ? I just saw a bad omen . it was a mistake . It must be mistake . Cain ... Idiot . I told you not to come out ! So he 'll be coming here . There 's no way he 'd be satisfied with only stripping you the bone . I ... lost everything . Just when things were going well . Next is either me or Michio . Shouldn 't you run - Throw it all away while I can ? I 've finally made it big ! I won 't stand for it being all stolen away ! Fire ! Cease fire ! It 's my job . Sorry . Money ! Give me back my money ! { * } Can 't I pay you back with tonkatsu ? You promised you 'd get it back ! { * } officer ! you 're an excellent bodyguard . { he just has that Hogan feel } Way above the rest . W-why ? It won 't take ... my bills ! bro . head for the graveyard up ahead . P-please . Church ... Huh ? Boss .. To think I wouldn 't steal from a stranger . This is the second time I 've done it . Well that makes you a generous man . Keep livin ' ! I 'm planning another big job . I 'm returning the favor for saving me . I won 't participate in robbery . I 'm just a bodyguard . you can 't just say you 're not participating in this rat race after firing a cross like that . I 'm a man of the cloth . It 's against my principles to get involved . So I shoot my cross . Never heard of a priest like that ! Going to eat ? Shall I accompany you ? Hey lady ! Yo ! A woman ? For sure . She won 't come if you do that ! You again ? Don 't follow me . We boarded the same Sand Steamer and came to the same town ; It 's clearly fate ! You should treasure things like that . then you 've got much more of a connection with those guys . right ? Me ? Aren 't I right ? I understand now . The reason I came was to meet you . Miss Amelia . How do you know my name ? I saw the hotel register . Are we at the same hotel ? ! the same room ? Itchy ! Amelia ~ Let me throw one more ! You got in my way ! Sorry . It 's my turn . Not fair ! Lame ! Move it ! Let me try ! I 'm guaranteed to win . Bingo ! Give it up ! pay up ! Forget it . Welcome . Two ? one . Would it be too much trouble for us to get a quiet table ? One ! Table for two please ! One is fine ! coincidence isn 't it ? It 's been a long time — Well this is a coincidence . I have some friends over there ! And they happen to have two seats open ! Lets sit with them — please ? There 's no room but over there . Cheers ! Good work today ! So Amelia is after Gasback ? That 's great ! we have a really nice plan . Shall I explain it to you ? I 'm fine . That ill foreboding is no good ! She 's strong ! Right ? And what about you ? Huh ? Did you come here for the bounty too ? Nah I happen to be here for some sightseeing . Is that really true ? You won 't have anything to do with Gasback ? maybe ... Maybe " is a troubling answer ! and now even the Humanoid Typhoon — won 't you please leave ? and this is what you say ? Just by you being here trouble will surely follow . Don 't say such a cold thing . I 'm just sightseeing . I can 't trust you . Actually trouble is around the corner already .. Could you and Gasback ... I just got here today . why are you here ? It 's company orders ; Our priorities have changed . It 's our job . She 's as strict as ever . Yes ! She 's reliable ! enough ! just leave soon ! after this job is over we 'll just end up following you around again ! Eh ? So insurance people are stalkers ? Stalkers ? Are we that bad ? Oww-w-w ! What are you doing ? That hurts ! I wont let you have your way . it 'll come off ! It 'll come off ! shut up ! Vash ! Vash the Stam — Is it okay for this town to be in a panic ? There 's nothing good that could come from you being here . Hey you ! You can 't do this to Vash the Stampede and get away with it ! you couldn 't be Vash ! it could work ! It 's fitting for an idiot to say something like that ! are you his babysitter ? Must be rough . It 's cosplay isn 't it ? A bad outfit like that suits you ! Here he is ! Vash the Stampede ! I get it . You 're the real thing . He doesn 't look like him at all . Come up with a new stage name and try again ! thank you . you fell for it ! Are you a true idiot ? I 'm the legendary bounty ! So scary ! Nobody believed ... That turned out well but ... at this rate ... Look . Doesn 't it just scream " Steal me " ? You 've got bad taste for sure . To think you 'd really aim for that . I 've got a little score to settle with the owner . I knew where he was but I was delayed a bit . this robbery will be the best one I 've ever pulled off . I waited ... waited ... waited . { * } So I could snatch it away at the ideal time . The act is the same but the aftertaste of it is completely different . Robbery is the same . To reach the peak and steal every last thing . The victim will taste absolute despair that no one has ever tasted before . Half-assed robbery is no good . Isn 't that right ? I 'll pull off the best robbery this world 's ever seen . That 's what I 'm aiming for . bro . The contract lasts ' til we get to his mansion . aren 't I. It 's the guy that can 't hold his liquor again . Don 't tease me . I love this atmosphere . Then I won 't turn you away . just one glass . I 'm telling you ... Gasback will make our company go poof ! I see . A guy like Gasback ... like Gasback ... Bathroom . Have fun ! Yo . What ? that statue is big trouble . And Gasback will ... What did you just say ? Like I said ... Women and money can 't be obtained with only brute force . I thought I heard something that sounded like " shit " after that . Did I mishear ? Oh no it 's just a misunderstanding . If you didn 't hear me I 'll tell you again . You bag of shit . What did you say ? ! You bitch ! A fight ! let me join in ! I 'll kill you ! Fight ! Uninvolved guys should butt out ! Fight ! Meryl ... There seems to be some kind of trouble . stop them ! a real bar room ! How 's that ? Shit ! You ! Hey everyone calm down ! so let 's get along and drink ! Alright ! I won 't forgive you ! Huh ? Why ? Where did the bullets go ? You ! Give me back my ammo ! Well we 're in this hotel . See you later then . Good night ! The coverage amount is $ $ 5 billion ! Insurance workers sure have it hard . Let me down . I can walk . Don 't put on some false show of bravado . { fake pride } It 's fine . I won 't touch you . I 'll only touch you in bed — Hey did you know ? Once Gasback was cornered and on the verge of being captured . 20 years ago . and some idiot let him get away . there 's a limit to being a nuisance . how many people would have lived ? That man is partially responsible for the deaths of those people . By him ... I ... Did something precious to you get stolen by him ? Perhaps it was ... a maiden 's first kiss — You drank my beer ! I have no idea what the fuck you 're talking about ! Jeez . What did a guy like you come here for ? Dunno . It feels like I 'm chasing cast dice . Huh ? In other words ... The dice have created a lover 's paradise for me and you ! You ... Are you gonna puke ? okay ? Okay ? ! I 'm okay ... Really ? We 're heading up the stairs ! { * } let me down ! you — Hey wait ! what 's that ? It 's a precious secret . A precious secret ? I 'll tell you one day . Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! Amelia . For not being able to be beside you ... while you grow up . Even though I promised ... to tell you about the precious secret ... Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom . Hey you guys ! when it comes time to work you won 't be able to ! I 'd say the same for you . Let 's return to the office . Let 's continue the rounds ! I 'm on patrol ! Is everything in order ? good evening . No problems . It 'll provide this town 's electric power for several hundred years more . That 's amazing . $ $ 5 billion ... guys ! It 's Gasback ! Unable to confirm ID . Vacate the premises immediately . you will be eliminated . you will be eliminated . you 're pissing me off . Machines shouldn 't speak . Eliminate . bro . You 've got some bizarre stuff going on there . It turns them black instantly Usually it takes ten lives to destroy just one of those things . Boss ! What ? Michio 's factory ? Please hide me . Fine . Just let him come . I heard that Gasback attacked Denna City last night ! Seriously ? You ... got ... me ... Yay ! We defeated Gasback ! I 'm going to get you back ! Roar ! well if it isn 't Vash . Good morning . Huh ? You two seem perfectly refreshed despite drinking so much yesterday . We just received great news . We heard that Gasback attacked a factory last night in Denna instead of here . His target was most likely not here . I thought it was weird for him to target such an unfashionable bronze statue like that . Meryl ? we have to go contact the main office . We 'll excuse ourselves now . Please excuse us ! the news about Gasback attacking here was fake . We were toyed with . hey ! Where are you going ? since I 've gathered enough information here . the fact that Gasback was attacking this town was just a rumor . He was probably the one who spread the news . I don 't really thi — you 're right . There 's no way he would attack a remote town like this . See ya . It 'd be great if we met up again somewhere . You 're really bad at acting ! don 't you ? Do you know something I don 't ? ! And why do you keep trying to drive me away ? I 'm not really ... It 's just like him to gather all these weaklings together . I can pull off an even flashier robbery ! It 's Gasback ! Amelia . Shit ! He came this early in the morning ? I 'll be the one to take his head ! Old men shouldn 't be out this early ! Move ! Gasback is mine ! $ $ 300 million ! Let 's do our job ! Gasback has attacked . my head hurts . Meryl ! What should we do ? ! Well that 's obvious - We have to protect the statue ! I knew it ! Meryl ... everyone ? We can 't let him lay a single finger on the statue ! Who 's she ? I don 't know . He came ! I can 't wait anymore ! Aren 't you gonna protect him ? What are you going to do about the contract ? ! Cain ! right ? ! Wouldn 't it be better if we ran away now ? Shut up ! My fortune isn 't something worthless that 's easily abandoned like you guys and yours ! What do you mean by worthless ? ! What kind of end do you think it 'll come to if we 're captured ? Shut up ! That guy is coming here to get revenge ! Revenge for what we did to him 20 years ago ! He 's going to steal everything . Anything and everything ... Anything and everything ! my fingers are numb ! Are you the guy who 's been doing those petty things ? ! Petty ? Is that how it looked to you ? You mustn 't pass through here . It 's you . Are you planning to stick your head where it doesn 't belong again ? I don 't understand . I 'll be passing through . could you retreat ? I have some business with the people inside . Business ? You want to kill them . You can say that ! then I can 't let you through ! you 'll be letting him through . Wolfwood . can you stand back ? When did you turn into a robber ? Don 't joke around with me ! There 's complicated reasons as to why I 'm doing this ! Move ! Wait ! I can 't ! I won 't move ! This isn 't funny ! I 'm serious . Me too . Contract complete . He 's here ! You ... ! Gasback ! It 's all their fault ! The betrayal from 20 years ago too ! Please ... Forgive me with this ! Please ! accept my sincerity . Please ... please ! Cain . You were always a piece of unsalvageable trash . But it seems you 've gotten worse as you got older . Stop ... Stop ! Stop ! Hold it right there ! Gasback ! Amelia ? This is as far as you go ! You 're finished . this is some authoritative girl we 've got here . hasn 't it ? Could it be ... that it 's over ? that means we were saved ! Why are you being so easygoing ? Don 't let your guard down . Yes ... girl . You 're going to get hu — Don 't move ! Your weird abilities won 't work on me . that 's some confidence you 've got there . you should 've shot me in the back with no hesitation . You won 't defeat me if you can 't do that much . Timeout . since this is our long awaited reunion ? Huh ? Wa — Let go ! Stop it ! right Mr. Gasback ? We met earlier out front . You 're unexpectedly observant . You 're fooling around as always . How is it that your appearance hasn 't changed after 20 years ? It must be my spirit . Do you want me to blow off your finger ? ! No . let go ! because you 'll shoot if I do ! Of course I will ! Then no ! Shit ! Gasback will run away as well ! let go ! I don 't want to . I 'm really going to shoot if you don 't stop fooling around ! I still don 't want to . Vash ! Are you trying to save me like you did 20 years ago ? I 'm tired of hearing about the " Humanoid Typhoon . Humanoid ? Are you ... ? ! The legendary guy from 20 years ago ? I said to you back then . I wasn 't impressed by you saving a single life in this world of robbery . Do you think the dice you cast turned out well ? Who knows ... See ya ! Wait ! He got away . you were the idiot from 20 years ago . Why ... Why did you do such a thing ? right ? Why ? Some kind of religion ? Because ... Isn 't it unpleasant ? Being alive after all . But do you know that there are people crying because of that ? ! there would be people still alive ! There are people who could have lived without any suffering ! Even ... Even my mom ! Gasback ... I will definitely kill him ! as always . What can I do ? It 's my nature . I 'm the one who cast the dice . though . Like I 'll ever hand it to that bastard ! My 20 years of hard work ! Cain . Your life isn 't enough to settle the score for what you did to me 20 years ago ! I need to steal everything that 's yours ! I 'll show you ! This is the best robbery in the world ! are you insane ! ? My boss made me do such troublesome things . What ? ! It was fun while it lasted . What did you do ? ! What did you do to my Plant ? ! Just be a good boy and watch ! The Plant is ... ! The town will ... ! Meryl ... No way ! What 's this ? It 's rolling down ! Meryl ? um ... We have to run of course ! there 's hope ! What a relief . right ? $ $ 5 billion ... ! Cain ! I wanted to see that face of yours ! You tarnished my robbery . This is the price . Boss ! It 's connected ! Start the engine ! The Plant ... Could this be ... The Plant was taken . No way ! it was made for that cargo . This town is done for ! Amelia ! Spikey ! Move ! Or we 're going to run over you ! Gasback ! Hurry up and go after him ! Let 's go as well ! We won 't let you get away ! You 're hopeless ! Drive properly ! You know that I suck at driving ! I can only do this much ! Switch with me ! Switch with me now ! Stop ! look forward ! Wait ! Destroying the Plant is something you don 't want to do ! Letting Gasback escape is more of a problem ! Move out of my way ! I said move ! You can 't ! Are you an idiot ? ! Wait ! Just wait a second ! Amelia ! move ! Don 't get in my way as well ! Saying that won 't ... ! Amelia ! Calm down first ! Look out ! Spikey ! Girl ! Spikey ! Why ? Just why ? Even though I told him to die how can he make that kind of face ? Why ? His face said ... It 's all right " . What do you mean ? ! Is that all ? ! it 's okay for him to die when he tells others not to kill ? That doesn 't make any sense . My mom is dead . It 's because he saved Gasback . Not just my mom . Many more people would be alive if he didn 't save him . Saving those who don 't need to be saved . Dying just like that . I really don 't understand ! Does it make sense to you ? Is there a meaning behind him dying ? ! His rhetoric ... His ideals ... They disappear once he dies ! True . He really struggled through it . casting the dice like that ... If there was meaning behind it ... maybe it 's the fact that we want there to be meaning to it . But it 's as you said . Nothing is gained through death . Nothing moves without the Plant ! The electricity is gone ! Will we have enough water ? The elderly at my house will die without a heater ! Calm down . We 're asking for emergency help from another town right now . And we 're already looking into renting a new Plant . Tonight ! We need it tonight ! but water comes first ! we can 't get any water ! Please save us ! Our son was in an operation and stopped breathing just now ! The doctors are doing their best . who knows how long he 'll last ... My brother will ... Shit ! To think that Gasback would steal the Plant ! the town is done for ! Wait ! Destroying the Plant is something you don 't want to do ! Letting Gasback escape is more of a problem ! Move ! I am the same . The same as Gasback ... The idiot . what 's that ? This is a precious secret . A precious secret ? I 'll tell you one day when you get older . Amelia . For not being able to be beside you while you grow up . The precious secret that I promised to tell you about ... I 'll tell you — Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! mom ? What is it ? ! Mom ! Meryl . Meryl ! We have to tell the main office about the end of Vash the Stampede . Let 's hurry up ! Meryl ! right ? It looks like my popularity is at its end . I 'm free right now . will you work for me ? So you 're going to do it after all ? You and Vash live by the same principles ? Give me all you 've got as an advance payment . And why don 't I add breakfast to that as well ? I 'm the type that needs to eat breakfast . Boss ! The bodyguard bro . . And that girl again ? Coming by themselves is a joke . We 'll take cover on the left . Run to where I shoot ! All right . One . Two . Three ! Go ! Over there ! Now then . didn 't you . You 're not going to take my bullets ? But anything more than this is an eyesore . I 'll be taking back the Plant . What ? That 's as far as you go . to steal from a robber means we 're in the same business . if I steal your life you should have no complaints . You 've tarnished my robbery ! bro . Don 't move ! Sorry for you . That 's as far as you go . I 'll be taking your life too . bro . Did you use blanks or something ! ? It can 't be ! I properly ... are you all right ? Hey ... wasn 't that a bit too sloppy ? What if you hurt Amelia ? you died ! but look ! There 's nothing better for a man of the desert than hard tomakuns . But the insurance girls passing by ... . I thought I was gonna die . You ... I 'm going to wring your neck later . Eh ? You 're not glad ? Shall I wring it now ? Please don 't . So is there anything else I should tell you ? Any more than this is tough . Vash ! I want to settle this with you . let 's not ... Shut up ! I 'm moving forward . After I take your life . Won 't you answer the call of the dice ? Wolfwood . Don 't interfere . You 're too nice . Amelia . but ... When this hits the ground ... That was overwhelming . I see now that the legend of the Humanoid Typhoon wasn 't just " bad luck . Sorry . I have to apologize to you . Yes . my mom might have been saved . I 'm sorry . Really . Not yet ... Not ... yet ... ! Wait ! Your lives ... I 'll ... Steal them ! What ? ! You ... that glove is ... Where did you get that glove ? ! and she ... My mother . My mother left it to me . What ? Yes . The person you entrusted this to 20 years ago . you are ? Mom gave birth to me alone . She suffered and suffered . It can 't be . I gave her something so that she could live an easy life . A man like you stole it ! Stole everything ! No one would help Gasback 's wife and kid !

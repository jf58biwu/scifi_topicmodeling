 I 'll finally have my weekends free . Dr. Holiday : It 's working . The de-com nanites are deactivating the control group . [ All cheering ] Total deactivation achieved . A toast to me . What ? You think this could have worked without my nanite-immobilizing algorithm ? [ Beeping ] Dr. Holiday : Hold off on the high fives . The nanites are back online ... And self-destructing . Shut it down . We 'll reset and try again . I cannot shut it down . Impossible . - All the simulations I ran Zag-rs : Were perfect . This new data will be most helpful . Who said that ? Rex : Zag-rs . I 'm detecting a data signal from the station to a location off-site . Rex : Doc , do you remember that psycho computer program that was gonna destroy the world ? She 's back . Zag-rs : I prefer " artificial intelligence . " And I don 't want to destroy the world . Just all the nanites in it . Admittedly , every creature infested with them will die . Bobo : Hey , I resemble that remark . Rex : Didn 't happen last time . Not gonna happen now , zag . Dr. Holiday : Actually , Rex , if it has this program in its current state , that 's exactly what will happen . ♪ So make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way we 're gonna have fun tonight ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ ♪ so make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ Rex : Out of my way ! Out of my way ! The data stream is being rerouted through our relay switcher at Providence . You 'll need to turn it off . Rex : It 's off . - White knight : Well ? - Negative , sir . It 's now streaming directly to an unknown location . We 've lost the feed . Dr. Holiday : How far along is the experiment download ? Uh , uh ... 72 % Dr. Holiday : Rhodes , the communication controls kill that feed at the source . Volkov , help me contain the A.I. We need a firewall to stop it from getting off the ship . The data is encrypted . If we can stop it in time , the information will be useless . 84 % . There 's no time . Dr. Holiday : Zag-rs must not leave this station . You saw those test nanites blow up . Do you want that to happen inside every living thing on earth ? It 's just trying to distract us . Rhodes , unplug the containment unit . [ Machinery whirring ] Zag-rs : Your efforts are pointless . 95 % downloaded . 97 % . 98 % . Dr. Holiday : Unh ! We prevented it from escaping the station , but it seems to be hiding in the navigation system . How did it get here in the first place ? All our system software was thoroughly scrubbed . Dr. Holiday : Actually , not all of it . Someone insisted their groundbreaking program come in on a separate drive . [ Stammers ] This is not my fault . White knight : Holiday , you 're losing altitude ! Can you correct your vector ? Dr. Holiday : Negative , Providence . We 're locked out of navigation . Zag-rs is doing that . Rex : What happens if they can 't correct the vector thing ? Six : They 'll crash into the atmosphere and disintegrate . Dr. Holiday : Bouvier , you brought it on board . Now let 's go erase it . I swear , I did not know this would happen . The algorithm ... It was too easy to write . It practically created itself . Dr. Holiday , I 'll come . Dr. Holiday : If there 's power in the systems , she 'll just keep hiding until it reboots . We 'll have to ditch the power core and go for a complete shutdown . You positive ? Aah ! Dr. Holiday : Aah ! Holiday , what happened ? Dr. Holiday : Zag-rs opened the door on Rhodes . I have to stop her before she gets us all . Stop ! You can 't do this ! Not with the station 's spin ! It 's suicide ! So is staying here . I at least give myself a chance ! [ Beeping ] We 've got system failures . Multiple hull impacts . Six : Providence to station . Status . Dr. Holiday : Bouvier decided to leave early . I 'm going to jettison the power core . We 'll lose , well , pretty much everything . Rex : But you 'll get the station back on track , right , doc ? Dr. Holiday : We can always hope , Rex . Holiday out . Rex : Hey , doc ? Doc ? ! Dr. Holiday : Looks like it 's just you and me , Pete . What 's our status ? - Battery life support , but that 's all . - Dr. Holiday : Any sign of Zag-rs ? [ Keys clacking ] Orbital decay is increasing . And as long as they 're tumbling , launching the other capsule is too dangerous . Rex : Well , send someone to fix it . White knight : How long to prep a shuttle ? 12 hours . They 'll hit the atmosphere and break up in about two . Six : We need options . - Could try the space elevator . - Rex : Perfect ! Put me on it and I can fix the station . White knight : It 's only for cargo . The g-forces alone would kill a person . Rex : Uh , hello ? Have we met ? Not exactly a normal person here . White knight : We can 't afford to lose you , too , Rex . Rex : No one 's losing anyone . Come on , knight . Have I ever not made it work ? Six : Replacement power core and relays . The elevator doesn 't reach the station 's orbit altitude , so you 'll use the freight sled at the top of the station . Rex : Sure you don 't want to come ? Bobo : Yeah , chimps have bad history with space , so ... No . Have a good trip . Try not to die . Six : How 's it going ? Rex : Oh ! Great ! Thanks for asking . Six : Good . Because we need to speed you up to make the rendez-vous window . Rex : But aah ! [ Groans ] What was that ? Six : You crashed through the station . Rex : That 's not supposed to happen , is it ? Six : Problem with the braking mechanism . If you can 't stop , you 'll keep going ... Forever . Rex : [ Grunting ] Aah ! [ Grunting ] Aaaaaah ! [ Sighs ] Stopped it . White knight : Can he make the rendez-vous ? Six : Uh , yes . Rex , they made a slight miscalculation in the rate of the station 's orbital decay . Rex : Uh-huh . Define " slight . " [ Crashing ] Rex : Unh ! Six : Rex ! Rex , do you read ? Rex : Ow . [ Air hissing ] [ Cracking ] Aah ! Unh ! Hope the doorbell works . [ Breathing heavily ] Unh ! [ Sighs ] Mission control , I made it aboard . Mission control , come in ! [ Beeping ] Oh , great ! The radio . Well , welcome aboard to you , too . Hello ? Doc ? Anyone here ? Dr. Holiday : Rex ? ! What are you - how did you - Rex : Space elevator . Can you believe it ? The impact a few minutes ago . Rex : Oh . Yeah . Let 's just say " down " is no longer an option . Dr. Holiday : Not many options here , either . The power 's nearly gone . Communications are shot . We only have a little time left before we hit the atmosphere . Rex : So , how about you two put on your thinking caps and figure out what we need to do to not crash and burn ? We need power to do anything . Dr. Holiday : But Zag-rs should have been deleted in the power-core purge . Dr. Holiday : Fine . But both solar arrays are damaged , and the couplings are shot . Rex : Let me give it a try . What can he do ? This requires precision , not smashing . Rex : Hmm . Dr. Holiday : We can use Salvatore . Look , Volkov , Rex may not look like much , but having him here , he may actually save us . Rex : Thanks for the vote of confidence . Dr. Holiday : If you blow it , we 're dead . Got it ? Start with the couplings and see if we can use the solar arrays to generate any power . Rex : How 's the robot , uh ... ? Dr. Holiday : It 's voice-activated . Salvatore , pick up those yellow coupling cables . Rex : How 's that feel ? Slightly less catastrophic , thank you . Dr. Holiday : No . No computers . If Zag-rs is somehow still in there how do we stabilize this station without gyroscopic control of the thrust jets ? Rex : Pretty incredible up here , isn 't it , guys ? Aside from our imminent doom , yes . Awe-inspiring . Dr. Holiday : Rex , the thrusters are normally controlled through the navigation software . I need you to bypass the system and connect the thrusters directly to the command module . Rex : I can 't reach the thruster from here without ... Hold on to this , will you , Salvatore ? Are you sure you know what you 're doing ? Rex : Not a clue . Try the controls now . Reel me in , Sally . Salvatore ? Okay . Fire it up ! We might have a tiny chance of getting out of here alive . Altitude burn in 3 , 2 , 1 . [ Scoffs ] There must have been a fuel leak in the collision . Dr. Holiday : At least we 're stable enough for an evac now . Rex , take Salvatore and retrieve the containment unit . We 'll prep the escape capsule . Is this a bad time to observe there 's only two seats in the escape capsule and three of us ? Rex : Easy . You can sit on the floor , Volkov . Too bad we can 't take sparky with . I could really go for a robo-butler . Dr. Holiday : Talk with knight when we get home . I think we can go now . Rex : Unh ! Zag-rs : Correction . Now I can go . Zag-rs : You were right to shut the station down . I would have regained control if you hadn 't . Fortunately , I was able to download myself into something autonomous . That is our only means of survival ! You can 't take it ! Zag-rs : Incorrect . Unh ! Rex : [ Groans ] Be careful ... The hull ! Rex : Sorry , Professor , but this requires smashing , not precision . Aah ! Get to the capsule ! [ Groaning ] Aah ! Zag-rs : It seems you 've forgotten my ability to destroy nanites at close range , Rex . Rex : Thanks for the reminder . Why worry about hitting the atmosphere ? These two will get us first . Rex : [ Gasps ] Hey , trying to stop a killer robot over here . " Thanks " or " keep it up " would do fine ! Unh ! Unh ! Zag-rs : To defeat me , you 'll have to destroy the station and everyone on board . But I did enjoy stabilizing the station with you . [ Beeping ] Please exit the capsule now . Rex : Forget stable . Unh ! [ Rumbling ] Dr. Holiday : Rex , come on ! Rex : Can 't ... Do it . I 'm spent . Go ! Launch while you can . Dr. Holiday : Not till you 're in here ! Rex : You 've got the nanites . If anyone can figure out how to make them work , it 's you . You won 't even need me anymore . I 'll hold her off ! [ Grunts ] Launch ! Dr. Holiday : Rex , you never gave up on us . We 're not giving up on you . Now get in here so we can go home ! - Zag-rs : This is not over . - Rex : Oh , it is for now . Engaging stabilizers . The heat shield is damaged . It appears we are going to die . Again . Rex : I got your heat shield ... Right here ! Hot , hot , hot , hot , hot ! Oh-ho ! Hot ! Hot ! Hot ! Aah ! White knight : Shut it down . [ Beeping ] Dr. Holiday : Providence , this is Holiday . We 're clear of re-entry and deploying parachute . Think you could arrange a pickup ? Six : On its way . You 'll be happy to know we 're in contact with Rhodes . Her space suit saved her . We 're prepping a shuttle now . Dr. Holiday : Thanks . And , Six ... It 's good to hear your voice . Rex : Listen , doc . About up there , just before we got away from the robot ... Dr. Holiday : After you came all that way to get me ? It 's the least I could do . Rex : So ... How long until we get picked up ? Bad news . Transponder is toast . Rex : Ha ! You two better not get seasick .

 Ahhh ! Come here . Where are you going ? Did you hear that ? Nice try . I don 't scare that easy . Yeah . You okay ? Oh , my God , Mr. Howard ? Don 't take no for an answer There 's no telling where we 've been Because people don 't understand , understand , understand People don 't understand People like me - Oh , my God ! - Oh ! I said , " No . No . " International . International . Agreed . Yes , exactly . Yes . International , absolutely . If anything could taste that good . Whoa . Yeah , well , it 's my friend 's place , but she 's , um , she 's letting me stay here . You know , I still can 't understand how you managed to figure out the recipes to everything we just had simply by tasting them . I mean , that 's incredible . I , uh , I have a super sensitive palate . No kidding . Well , I was thinking that ... Maybe we could ... Before you get your own show on the Food Network ... We could , um , I don 't know , whip something up . Just you and me . Whip something up ? Yeah . Oh , I 'm ... I 'm sorry ... Did I ... Did I do something or ... No . I need you to go . Yeah , sure . Could you please just leave now ? You okay ? Please . No , no , no , don 't touch me , please . Okay . I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry , Can you go ... Just please go . Okay . Rachel ... For the 50th time , Nina , I 'm not going to talk about my date with Sam . Fine . But if you suddenly decide to spill , just remember , I have plans tonight . I won 't spill . Rachel ! Morning , everyone . I come bearing gifts . Oh , let me open it . All right . Let me open it , please . No , I want to open . Oh , yeah , let me open it , please . It 's the sound of red tape being cut courtesy of Agent Sullivan . Oh , it 's badges . That 's official cover , right ? Nail on the head , Cameron . I get to keep this one . It 's my photo . Apparently , we all get one . Now we both have badges , Bill . DCIS ? Look at your picture . Agent Sullivan said this is going to help us with our investigatory hurdles . I thought I was the answer to our investigatory hurdles . Here 's yours , Bill . What does DCIS even stand for ? It says , it 's Defense Criminal Investigative Service . Yeah . Still no idea . Hello . This is Zahra Pirzad . Rachel ? Please leave a message after the tone . Oh , I 'm sorry . I 'm interrupting . No , no , it 's fine . Please come in . Was that ... That Sam fellow ? Does everybody here know everything about my life ? It 's an office , Rachel , that 's what happens . People watch out for each other , and a first date is quite a milestone in any young woman 's life . Please ... Dr. Rosen , I 'm not going to talk about this . Not with Nina and certainly not with you . All right , if you change your mind ... Thank you . I 'm here . I will let you know . How would you Iike to go on a little road trip ? To where ? Fenton , Pennsylvania . Agent Sullivan called about a situation there and I think your abilities might come in handy . According to Sullivan , Fenton 's been hit by a rash of deaths . Three so far . The victims suffered rapid onset organ failure . The CDC found abnormalities in the victims ' brains , but no pathogens that could have caused them . Of course , the CDC doesn 't know about Alphas . Now it 's our turn . I wouldn 't have guessed we 'd need to employ our ... Our new cover so quickly . I don 't know . I think I liked it better when we were seeking out math experts and violin prodigies . I know . It 's a bit of an adjustment . An adjustment ? Well , our mandate is changing , Rachel . You know the saying , reward for success is ... Well , we shouldn 't get ahead of ourselves . We don 't even know if we 're dealing with an Alpha yet . That 's why I need my best forensic investigator ... I smell fear . Whatever 's happening here , this whole town is scared to death . Yeah , they said it 's right up here . It 's radiation from that nuclear plant upriver . I read an article about electromagnetic fields caused by power lines , cancer clusters . Terrified . Just like the others . Hmm ? Seem to have a bit of a chicken or the egg thing going here . Dr. Rosen ? Yes . Yes . Miss Pirzad ? Pirzad , yes . I 'm Dr. Calder , CDC . I was under the impression that the CDC had already ruled on this case . Yeah , we 're just pulling up stakes as we speak . But when I heard they were sending in the DCIS , I thought that I might do the hand-off myself . Oh , that 's very considerate of you . Now , I 've read your reports . Are there any further developments ? With all three victims , the damage was centered in their amygdalas . The ... The structures in the brain that process fear and stress . It 's as if they were subjected to a sudden and really severe shock . Are these people afraid because their neighbors are dying or is it the fear that 's killing them ? Uh , chicken or egg ? Mmm ? Good luck . Three people are dead and we need answers . How 's my team supposed to focus when all they can think about is who 's going to drop next ? You 've gotta calm down . I 've told you everything I know . You haven 't told me a damn thing . Look , I swear , Marty , if you 're holding out on me ... Don 't threaten me . That was a lot of testosterone . Sheriff Handell . Hi . I 'm Dr. Lee Rosen . Rachel Pirzad . Marty . Sorry about that . Coach Zelanski gets a little passionate about his football team . Passionate ? I heard they were sending more people , so ... Exactly , who are you folks ? Oh , sorry . DCIS . Come on back . So how 'd this end up at Defense Department ? Are we looking at terrorism ? Well , I wouldn 't jump to any conclusions just yet . Sheriff , um , I 'm sorry , were there any links between the victims ? Ned Burton died first . He was David Burton 's dad . David ... David is a local football star . Ned was a realtor . Watts was our bank manager . And James Howard , a guidance counselor at Fenton High . Those bodies looked half-melted inside . But there was no infection and nothing on tox screens . Tell me what I 'm missing . I mean four deaths in four weeks is ... Is way out of my league . Did you say four deaths ? We were only informed about three . Yeah , the fourth was unrelated . Just a freak accident . What kind of freak accident ? Car crash . Chris Elkhart slammed into a telephone pole on his way home from school . It was a horrible tragedy . Autopsy ? In a small town like this , when a kid hits a pole , it 's probably drugs or alcohol , but ... Why put the family though that ? Besides , this had nothing to do with the other deaths . Probably have to see the body in order to be certain . I assume , we 'll need a court order to exhume . Chris 's mother has been through hell . I promise we 'll be as considerate as possible . Exhume Chris ? Uh , I don 't understand . I 'm a father , Mrs. Elkhart , but I can only begin to imagine your pain . But , um , given the circumstances of Chris 's accident , we 've asked Sheriff Handell to help us look into things a little further . Isn 't that right , Rachel ? I 'm sorry , Mrs. Elkhart , how long was it just the two of you ? Chris was 12 when his father passed . Cancer . That must have been a difficult time . Chris helped me get through it . I know most teenagers don 't want to hang out with their mother , but ... Chris always told me that I was his best friend . He always called us " the dynamic duo " . I 'm sorry I have to ask this but , um , around the time of the accident , was there anything out of the ordinary happening in Chris 's life ? Was he exhibiting any odd behavior ? Chris tried out for the football team this year . It 's a religion around here . Yes . But he wasn 't big enough , so Coach Zelanski made him equipment manager . We ran into the coach earlier . He was very , uh , passionate . He 's a thug . He used to get on Chris for everything . He 'd shout at him to move faster , do a better job . I told him to quit , but he didn 't want to let the team down . They all showed up for his funeral , though . Players and coaches . That must have been very comforting . Chris would have liked it . He was finally one of them . I 'm ... I 'm so sorry . This is ... This is so unprofessional . Chris ... Chris was so lucky to have such a loving mother like you . Oh , that is so sweet of you to say . All right , um , if you think exhuming his body would help ... But could we please get this over quickly ? Rachel , are ... Are you all right with this ? I need you to be honest with me . Look , I know , I lost it in there , Dr. Rosen . I will not let that happen again . But it will . And that 's okay . You know , I 'm glad we have this chance to talk , because you 've been feeling pretty sensitive since you moved out of your parents ' home , haven 't you ? My mom won 't even return my calls , Dr. Rosen . So , seeing what a loving relationship Mrs. Elkhart had with her son has probably made you feel ... It hurt . Look , I just ... I just want to find out whoever did this to her , okay ? Whoever took her child away from her . Mmm-hmm . That coach seems like a real nightmare . Fear and stress , right , Dr. Rosen ? Yes , well , we need to find out everything we can before we confront anybody , but yes , that sheriff was not a very big fan of Coach Zelanski . Sheriff ? This is odd . Is anybody here ? I smell decay . One heartbeat . Back there . Rachel . Sheriff Handell ? Sheriff Handell ? The smell . It 's everywhere . Rachel , wait ! Help ! Are you all right ? I don 't know . Sheriff ? Can you hear me ? I should 've listened . Who did this to you ? I should 've stopped it . Please , just call me back . Is Rachel joining us ? I told her , her food was getting cold , but ... Well , if she feels anything like I do , I imagine she 's quite rattled . I 'm just gonna have to take one for the team . Tea , Bill ? Eggs , cheese , bacon , pancakes , you sure these folks around here didn 't just die of heart failure ? Heart failure ? Because of the food . Maybe they were just bored to death . Hey , I grew up in a town like this . - Of course , you did . This is where you made your name , Hicks . What were you , the star quarterback ? No , star pitcher , right ? What can I say , I peaked early . Well , I can say with confidence that none of these people died from boredom or poor diet . Cortisol levels in Sheriff Handell 's blood were five times higher than I 've ever seen . Hmm , cortisol , makes sense . Come on , what 's cortisol about ? It 's a hormone produced when the body undergoes stress . At chronically elevated levels , it can shrink the amygdalas , even eat away at muscles and organs . Now imagine that on a radically amplified scale . Can I get you anything else ? DCIS . You don 't ask questions . We ask questions . We ask and you tell . Gary , that 's impolite . So you really are Feds . Put it away . I knew it . It 's a serial killer , isn 't it ? - You tell us . Respect the badge . - Gary . Gary . Bill is laughing . Well , what else could it be ? I mean , I know they didn 't find poison , but there 's untraceable poisons , right ? Or maybe it 's something in the water . Ma 'am , I promise you , we 're looking into anything and everything related to these ... These victims . And when we find out what caused this , we 'll let everyone know . Ah ! Meet Coach Kent Zelanski . He 's ... Grease . Thank you , Gary . So , he 's connected to four of our victims . He 's the guidance counselor , the football player 's father and Chris Elkhart . And Rachel and I saw him in conflict with the sheriff . Mmm . I don 't know what our next steps should be . You know murder investigations aren 't exactly a cornerstone of my practice . Well , I 'm sure you don 't think I just came here for a vacation , right ? I got you . Thank you , Bill . Nina and I will start with Coach Zelanski . I want the rest of you to canvas the school . Be very , very careful . We don 't know how this Alpha is killing folks , so ... If there is an Alpha . Yeah , well , we still want to be on alert , people . I can 't believe we still have cheer practice when people are dying . Miss Rue was all up in my grill over that trig test . Up in my grill . Try to concentrate on the ones with Coach Zelanski , okay ? Yeah . Ooh ! My jacket doesn 't have leather sleeves . I want a patch on my jacket , a " G " . Okay , I 'm going to get you a " G " . For Gary . For Gary . I 'm going to sew it on myself . Yeah ! You just focus for a couple minutes , okay ? Yeah . Okay ! Hey , Cameron , you 're up in my grill now . You got to get out of my grill . Okay . Coach Zelanski sends mean emails . There 's one to Rich Wallace and there 's three , no , there 's four , to David Burton . David Burton ? Burton , isn 't that the name of one of our dead guys ? DCIS . No ! What ? Eyes to yourself . Yes ! What does my relationship with Ned Burton have to do with his death ? Like I said , we 're just trying to get a better sense of the victims . You think I don 't see where this is going ? You tell me . Where 's this going ? You know , you better be pretty sure of yourself before you come into my school and accuse me of being a part of ... Listen , listen . Nobody is accusing you of anything , yet . Do you know what I do for this town ? In case you haven 't noticed , Panthers Football is Fenton . My team gives people hope and you come in here insinuating I had something to do with these deaths ? I never insinuated anything . You are a damn liar . Just stop it ! You need to sit down , lose the attitude and answer questions . Right ! Right . I 'll answer your questions . What do you want to know ? I 'd like to see these fancy badges do that . Coach Zelanski is an ass and he 's definitely not an Alpha . And you 're certain about that ? I could be wrong . Maybe it is the water . Bill , CDC 's been very clear about that . So , assuming it is an Alpha , someone who 's using fear and intimidation to kill these people . Have you come across anyone who fits that profile ? There was one football player that kept popping up in Handell 's files for fighting , vandalism , also bullying . He bullied ... Hold on . Hold on . Where 's Gary ? David Burton . No one likes David Burton . Not the coach . Not anyone . He punched you ? Yeah . Did you see Burton freakn out ? " Freakn " , F-R-E-A-K-N . That 's not a word . Guy 's a psycho . " Doosh ! " Get out of my hallway , wuss ! Oh , hey , you 're David Burton . Killer scares people . You scare people . Kill ... Since when are they letting retards into this school ? I 'm not . I 'm not a ... Hey , you shouldn 't use that word . I 'm autistic . You 're a retard . You look pretty retarded to me . Thirty two on the CARS scale . You have bad breath . Yeah . Carly Wellin , she said that she 'd rather lick a toilet seat than kiss you . It got 47 retweets . Hey , don 't touch me . I don 't like to be touched . Yeah ? Well , that 's really too bad for you , man . Hey , hey , back off ! Hey , leave my boys alone . That 's David Burton , the Alpha ! Stop him ! Let me borrow this . FBI . Out of the way ! Excuse me ! Out of the way ! Jeez . Doc ! I just tried to trip the kid , not kill him . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry ! I didn 't mean to . Cameron , you did not do this . He is not an Alpha . He 's another victim . - How ? I mean , where 's the Alpha who did it ? There 's a hospital about 15 miles from here , Kathy , I need you to secure an MRI suite . Yes , I want to run some tests , see if I can isolate the cause . His jacket 's getting caught on the door . It 's too bulky . You should take it off . Gary . Gary , back up . Let me wear it ! Gary , Gary , you 're gonna get hurt . Uh , the lever right there . Come on . - It 's stuck ! I think our being here has accelerated the killer 's time table . I would appreciate some help now . Yes , we 're on our way . Bill , Cameron , I think you should stay here and keep looking . It might be a good idea to retrace David 's last few hours . Dr. Rosen , I 'd like to stay , too . Okay . Gary , are you okay ? Gary , get in . No . I have bruises in my hair . So , David 's family 's saying he left at the same time as usual , walked through the neighborhood . No one at school saw anything strange up until the fight . We 're coming up empty . Not so fast , kids . The exhumation on Chris Elkhart is done . We got the whole deal , we have the autopsy and we got the County Medical Records , the accident reports the school files I requested . Now Rachel , you said that in all the victims the amyg ... The ... Amygdalas . Thank you , Dr. House . They shrunk on all the vics , right ? Yeah . Well , that 's not the case with Chris Elkhart . So , it was just an accident ? I don 't know . The accident report 's not adding up . Hicks , that temporal-spatial-whatever thing you do . That can come in handy . I need you to come with me . It 's nice to feel wanted . You know what ? You guys go ahead , I 'm going to go talk to the mom . Gary , take that off . It 's not yours . No . It looks better on me . I 'm a baller . How do you even know that word ? It 's the right word . Nina . Nina . Same symptoms as all the other victims . Cortisol levels through the roof . And when we flushed his system , his body continued to produce cortisol as rapidly as we could get rid of it . Well , maybe David was pushed and it just keeps triggering him . Yeah , maybe Nina 's the killer . Are you the killer , Nina ? It 'd be a surprise . Because for the levels to remain so high for so long , they would have to be triggered continuously . These readings are consistent with a ... A drug addict . That 's why his body is producing so much cortisol . He 's in withdrawal . Withdrawal ? But what 's he addicted to ? Well , there were no foreign substances indicated in his blood . I think he 's addicted to a person . They all were . The patterns were all the same . Addiction and then withdrawal . Fatal withdrawal . He 's non-responsive to meds , just like all the others . I really feel we need to quarantine this kid . It won 't be necessary . Whatever is making him sick , it 's not contagious . Dr. Calder , hello again . I asked the hospital if they would call me if anyone else fell ill . May I ? We need to initiate support therapy right away . Start a dilaudid drip . What did you just do to him ? I ... I just took his hand . It seemed as though he needed some contact . Let go . Just for a moment . Okay , okay , take hold again . Both hands . I don 't get it . Why is this helping ? By holding his hand , Nina , she 's giving David exactly what he needs . It 's a chemical secreted by his own brain . It 's oxytocin . It 's often called the love hormone . It 's critically important in bonding people to the ones they love . And conversely , it causes the very real pain people speak of when separated . That 's where the cortisol comes in . Yes . We need oxytocin right away . Okay . There 's something I think I can add to that . Will you help me ? Nina , someone in David 's life has done this to him . A serial killer who formed an unnaturally strong bond and then severed that bond . Our Alpha . He 's flatlining ! Nina , hold tightly . Crashing here ! Based on the medical evidence , it doesn 't look like Chris was a murder victim , but my colleagues are still looking into it and we should have answers for you very soon . But you had a suspect ? David Burton . I read David 's file . I know that he bullied Chris , but now he 's dying . Well , you 'll excuse me if I don 't shed any tears . Not after what David and his friends did to my son . What exactly did they do ? Jessica , we need to know everything . They thought he was weak because he couldn 't make the team . He didn 't like the same music they like . Stupid things . So they ridiculed him , spread rumors about him on the Internet , beat him up . The worst part for Chris was that he idolized those boys . He couldn 't understand why they had targeted him . I 'm sorry for dumping all of this on you . You were very kind to come here . When did you say your friends were coming back ? Oh ! Well , they 're at the accident scene , so half-hour , maybe 45 minutes . Oh ! You could wait here . I could make you a snack ... Sorry . No , it 's okay . It 's a habit . It 's just a habit . I guess in some ways you remind me of him . You 're so sweet . I won 't keep you . No , it 's okay . I 'd love to stay . Really ? Yeah . Snack sounds good . This is the spot , huh ? You know , I am fully literate in accident reports , Hicks . Did you know that ? Was it raining ? An oil slick or something ? No . It was a clear day , overcast , so no sun in his eyes like today . How fast was he going ? Report says 65 . But he had good brakes and new tires , so ... Plenty of room to maneuver . I 'd expect to see swerve marks if it was an accident . What you got ? This is no accident . Oxytocin seems to be working . Your instincts may very well have saved David 's life . I still don 't understand the addiction to the oxytocin . I mean , does your team have any idea what 's causing it ? Um , yes . We do . Okay . Just the glaring silence of government work . Something you seem to be familiar with . It 's been a pleasure . Thank you . I need to see ... I need to see her . Tell her I 'm ... I 'm sorry ... And I didn 't mean to hurt her . Who do you need to see , David ? Who didn 't you mean to hurt ? Just let me know if anything changes , please . Sure . Yes , Bill . Doc , I think we have our Alpha . Who ? How ? According to Hicks , Chris Elkhart did not die in an accident . Look , he crashed on purpose , Doc . The kid floored it right into a pole . I got this , okay ? This is what I do . Put it on speaker . We matched the autopsy with the police report and the facts are not matching the conclusions . I mean , this kid died of a suicide . And why wasn 't that in the reports ? No idea , Handell covered it up . He covered up a lot of things , like that ... That football kid , David Burton , apparently he 'd been bullying Chris something awful . According to Chris 's file , his mother raised holy hell about it . The guidance counselor , Dave 's dad and that team booster Marvin Watts . Yeah , and Sheriff Handell . No one did anything about it . So there 's your motive and opportunity . Yeah , a grieving mother , entire town to blame . Yep . Rachel . What ? Rachel just went to that woman 's house . Oh , my God . Come on ! Is that nutmeg and cayenne ? I 'm impressed . I only used a pinch of cayenne for the whole batch . That was Chris 's favorite . You really loved him , didn 't you ? He was my son . My parents , um ... Think I 'm a freak . Oh , I can 't believe that . The cayenne . That was nothing . I can taste every ingredient . This blanket , alpaca and silk . Plus 5 % performance fleece . I can tell you that just by touching it . All my senses are that strong . That 's amazing . Have you always been like that ? You should hear what my parents say . I hear them . They think I 'm sick because I can 't stand the sight of germs . Because sometimes I won 't eat . They pray that they can find someone , anyone to marry me . But I can 't even handle the kiss . Who 's going to want to marry someone like that ? The only thing I 'm good for is being a walking crime lab . Have you told your mother how you feel ? She won 't talk to me about it . In fact , she won 't talk to me about anything right now . That 's , um ... That 's , uh , Agent Harken . He probably knows something about Chris . I should get that . Rachel . It can wait . I 'm here for you . Aw . Angel . There , there . There . How do you feel ? I feel wonderful . No , no , no , wait . What ? Small town . Whatever . Anything ? No . All clear . I 'll try Rachel . Rachel . I am so glad that I can finally talk to someone . I don 't know why , but I feel like I can trust you with anything . You can . I want to trust Dr. Rosen . I do , but ... Sometimes I think all he cares about is my Alpha ability . So all of your team members are Alphas like you . Yeah . Everybody except for Dr. Rosen . Where are we going ? Well , we have to make one stop and then I 'll need your help to get away . Away ? Away from what ? Nina , has Gary pinged Mrs. Elkhart 's cell phone yet ? Sir , you can 't touch that . Hey , that 's illegal . DCIS . A little room , please . Any luck , Gary ? No . I 've got signal overload . Doppler radar truck 's in the neighborhood . I hate Doppler 2000 and 3000 . And 4000 . Okay , you heard that ? If I think back Rachel was drawn to that woman immediately . She could die . From what you said , this Jessica has no reason to hurt Rachel . I don 't think Mrs. Elkhart 's fully rational . The oxytocin bond works both ways and I think Chris 's death triggered something akin to psychotic post-partum depression . And Rachel 's incredibly vulnerable just now . Not just emotionally , but physically because of her ability ... Okay , I found her . The Doppler 's gone . They 're moving east on Cross Creek Road . Hicks and Harken are close . Get Harken and Hicks . Put them on . Put me on . You killed those people . Why ? How ? When Chris was born , I felt this overwhelming rush of love . And from that point on , I could make other people feel that way , too . I don 't see how that could hurt anybody . Neither did I until Chris 's funeral . David 's father came to me crying about what his son had done . And I comforted him . Then he told me he knew about the bullying and did nothing . I told him I never wanted to see his face again . The next day , he was dead . That 's when I knew how I could make things right for Chris . You 're talking about murder . I 'm talking about justice . Jessica , please , stop this . No . You 're a good person . I begged them to stop David and his friends ... I begged them and they blamed Chris . They blamed him , said that he was too sensitive . That I should ... I should take him to a therapist . I should toughen him up . Dr , Rosen can help you . I don 't need his help ! It hurts . I 'm sorry , Rachel , but you 're supposed to be helping me . If you help me , you 'll feel better . Okay , yeah , they 're heading east . Just head east . Okay , no , wait , go right . Are you sure ? Yeah . Go right now . Through the woods ? You should have let me drive . Yeah. you know what ? It 's my car . Okay . You can cut them off at the next intersection . Floor it ! Damn boondocks . Hello ? Damn it , Gary ! I broke my axle . I told you , you should have let me drive . That 's not my fault . You can drive safe and fast . Hands at ten and two . - Yeah , whatever . So , now what ? I don 't know about you , but I 'm going to run . What is it ? What do you see that I can 't ? Rachel . It 's Bill . The others can 't be far behind . What are you doing ? I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . What ? I 'm sorry , but I 've run out of time . Look at me . I don 't love you . I want you to die . Rachel ! Rachel ! Rachel ! Oh , Jessica , thank goodness . I am so glad that you called . With the Feds taking David and all these people dying , I just feel like I am losing it . But if we can talk , I know I 'll feel so much better . It always helps so much . I won 't be here long . Why not ? You murdered my son , Kent . You and the rest of them . No . And now I want you to spend your last few hours dying alone . Doc , she 's not responding ! What do ... What do I do ? Hold her still , Bill . Hold her still . Rachel . What is that ? It 's oxytocin . Something to counteract the withdrawal . This doesn 't look like withdrawal , Doc . I mean , it 's happening too fast . For anyone else . But not for Rachel . She 's not anyone else . Come on , girl . Oh , my God . It 's not working . She 's not breaking the pain cycle . Maybe she can . Rachel . Rachel , listen to me . Focus on my voice . Hold her . Hold her tight . Focus on the feeling of our hands . Just that feeling . Block everything else out . Feel the comfort . I need her . Her love is not real . Real love is unconditional , Rachel . Listen to me , I care about you more than you 'll ever know . You 're like a daughter to me . You always have been and you always will be . Concentrate . Concentrate . We love you , Rachel . We love you , Rachel . All of us . Rachel , listen to the doc . You can do it . You can do it . - You okay ? Come on . You can do it . Focus on the feeling of our hands . It 's working . She 's doing it . She 's doing it . You 're doing it . You 're doing it . - Can I put her ... Yeah , come here . Yeah . Dr. Rosen . Yes , we 're right here . We 're all here . You did it . Good girl . Oh ! Don 't do this , okay ? I love you . I would do anything to bring Chris back . Anything ! Little late for that . I know things got out of hand , okay ? I admit that . But if Chris wanted to play ball , he needed to be a whole lot tougher than he was . Nobody thought he would drive into a telephone pole . Nobody . Always comes back to that , doesn 't it ? Always comes back to , it 's always Chris 's fault . It 's Chris 's problem . I am ... I am so sick of hearing that . Tell me what ... What do you want me to do , Jessica ? Just tell me and I will do it . I swear , I will do it . Burn in hell . Hold it right there . Right there . Don 't move . Don 't let her touch you . No , no , no . We need an ambulance at 57 Poplar Way . No , no , no . Where are you going ? Don 't let him ... Don 't help him ! He let my son die ! I 'm sorry to hear that . Killing someone else is not going to help you , is it ? Jessica , stop . Chris wouldn 't have wanted you to hurt anyone , not for him . I ... I miss him . I know . I miss him . So , what did you tell everyone this time ? I kept it simple . Jessica poisoned her victims , which is true , to a point . She 's going away , isn 't she ? To Binghamton . Yeah . Yes . And I hope this isn 't the portent of more such cases to come . It 's the danger . That said , how are you ? We should have that printed up on T-shirts . I 'm alive , thanks to you . Thank yourself , Rachel . It was your own ability that saved your life . You 're a very capable young woman . More than you know . What do you say we ... We go home ? Home sounds good .

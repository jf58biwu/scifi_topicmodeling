 Okay , Audrey . Ready for calibration . You got it , Doc . Commencing calibration . You keep calling me " Doc , " I 'm gonna have to find a new research assistant . How long have you been threatening that ? Yeah , but this time , I mean it . Fine . Dr. Cooper , then . I know how much you love your title . Tracking . One-two-one-five . One-two-one-five ? Check . " 1215 . " Magna Carta . Come on , Doc ! It 's a document , where King John proclaimed liberties to the people . It 's a furbearer to our constitution . Yeah , I know what the Magna Carta is , but since it has nothing to do with dioxide sensors or anything we 're doing here , for that matter , guess what , you 're fired . Anything ? It 's a thing of beauty . Depth , pressure ... composition . All in a day 's work . Wait-wait-wait . Are you getting anything on the surface ? No . Why ? Our seismic sensors are showing some activity . You 're right on top of it . Matthew ' ? I 'm seeing a major subsurface C02 spike . Yeah . Me too . Trans Nova Oil 's new laser drill makes it possible to penetrate deeper than ever before , opening vast reserves previously unattainable . The Paxton Well promises oil deposits larger than those of Saudi Arabia . The site itself is housed in the safest , cleanest environment ever conceived . There 's no derrick . The entire operation is underground , eliminating any surface disturbance . In fact , the well itself is powered by its own hydro-electricity . Not good enough , folks . Nobody cares about drill technology or an operations room that 's 200 feet underground . Well , I 'm sure our stockholders do . Exactly my point ! We 're not selling our stockholders on the benefit of this well , Jennifer . We 're selling our critics ... the petitioners , protesters , the ones who don 't want us here . We will never pacify those people . All we 've done is embolden them by conceding to every concession , and what 's that gotten us ? Another injunction . We located our office , here , locally , in Paxton , to show them that we 're not just a corporate logo . We 're a neighbor . Which means we have to be good neighbors . We need to earn it . The drill site is located on a National Preserve , which is already one strike against us . Jobs and the environment ... this community cares about both , so we have to deliver both . We need to communicate that . A new era ... different kind of company . I almost think you mean that . We have to mean it . Look , we can build all the parks we want fund music programs , but these people will never welcome us as neighbors Oliver . Our focus should be Congress and getting the injunction lifted . It 's been seven months since the infrastructure was completed We 're bleeding . Which is just what I 'm talking about . All we need ... is Senator Bryce , and Bryce is up for re-election , is he not ? He listens to the voters , the people who live and breathe in this community . We convince them . That 's how we get the injunction lifted . Have you heard back from Senator Bryce ? I 'm emailing him again right now , but ... how do you spell " recalcitrant ? " I don 't even know what it means . It 's basically having a bad attitude towards authority . Well , that 's not a very helpful thing to say to a Senator , Emily . I 'm not . I 'm saying it about myself . You know , a little self-deprecation can go a long way . Oh , well , I 'll remember that . He can 't ignore me forever . He will . Thank you . Thank you , Mayor Bennett and members of the Council , but most of all , thanks to all of you , the good people of Paxton . Yeah ! I came here personally so that I could get to know your community and meet you face-to-face . And I came here with one agenda ... Let 's get you back to work ! And I 'm very happy to contribute to your community . This new park is a reminder that we are partners . I know that we 've had our ups and downs , but it 's your support that has made it possible for us to fulfill our promise . So call your Senators , call your representatives , and let them know that , together , we are helping to make this country independent of foreign oil . Let 's keep working together , let 's go forward together . Enjoy your park ! Thank you ! Thanks , Mayor . Did you know he was coming to Paxton himself ? People will see right through the manipulation . It 's obvious . He sells the product , Emily . And you say he 's a con artist , but I 'm not so sure other people are gonna see it , and I 'm not so sure anymore that this video is worth our time . Well , we need to show Congress that there isn 't support here . They need to see Trans Nova is trying to buy their way out of the injunction . The whole thing is a con ! Except you can 't make the argument that they haven 't done their part . We 'll lose credibility . Done their part ? Seriously ? By , what ? Drilling on what used to be protected land ? Putting us and the environment at risk ? Okay . Calm down . Obviously , they 've cast their spell on you , too . Who are you talking to , Em ? I 've been leading this fight since the very beginning . I hate those bastards . But guess what ? For the first time , an oil company 's actually listened to us . We 've made a difference . And what if it is as clean as it promises to be ? Every green initiative that we care about is gonna take a backseat . People will be more than happy in their gas-guzzlers , paying a buck-fifty a gallon . So you 'd prefer a catastrophe to prove your point ' ? As long as they 're drilling , it already is a catastrophe . So what did CalTech say ? They agree with USGS . They said the Crystal Lake event is a one-time anomaly , the water samples are back to normal , and there 's no additional venting . All right , well , what caused it , then ? Minor tremor under the lake breached a pocket of gas . That tremor wasn 't strong enough to release that much C02 that quickly . All that gas had to have already been trapped at water level by another stronger event . There 's something else going on here . But there 's no record of any other seismic activity . U-Unless it happened prior to their last report ? Of course . It 's getting worse , isn 't it ? Why don 't you go check with CalTech ? Dr. Cooper ? Hey , Dr. Cooper ! Hey . I 'm Emily Booth . We met briefly at the first Senate hearing . Yeah , I know who you are . I ... I 'm sorry , okay ? I know I was rude . I-I just want to ask you a few questions about what happened at Crystal Lake . The dead fish ? We know of other cases where underground drilling released toxic gasses to the surface . The drill 's been shut down for five months , so . Right , but they were drilling for two months before we shut them down Well , you know Mother Earth is a living , breathing creature . Sometimes underground gasses vent . I mean , that kind of volume is a little extreme , but it does happen . Bad day for the fish . No , it 's not just " a bad day for the fish . " Could those gasses have been released anywhere else ? Well , as of right now , they haven 't . " As of right now " ? I 'm sorry , Dr. Cooper , but I 'm just a little bit concerned here . I mean , we have a responsibility to the people in this community . Look , there 's no indication that this was anything else but a one-time event . I 'm sorry if that 's inconvenient for you . You think that this has nothing to do with the drilling ? No . Like you would admit that anyway , right ? I 'm sorry , what ' ? How can someone in your profession work for them ? You should be on our side , Dr. Cooper . Oh ! I see . So you think there 's ... there 's , what , only two sides ? Really ? You think that you 're the only one interested in making sure they toe the line up there ? Let me tell you something . My family has been here for four generations . This is my backyard , too . Oliver . How soon ? Thank you , Tom . We got the votes . We 're back up and running . That 's great . Hey ! Come here , you . I 'll be right in , okay ? So what time will you pick him up ? Nice try . I 'll wait in the car . Seriously , Todd ? How long do we have to do this ? You 're a convicted felon . I was arrested for protesting . For destruction of government property , wasn 't it ? That has nothing to do with this . Right , well . This wasn 't your only arrest , Emily . The courts ruled . Gotta live with it . Hi . God , I missed you . So ... what do you want to do ? Should we , should we play a board game ? You can pick . Do you have any video games ? No , I don 't have any video games . How are things at your dad 's ? Like always . You know , it 's not my choice that I can 't see you that often , Dylan . But it was your choice to go to jail . Remember when you got detention ? You got in trouble because you were sticking up for another kid who was being bullied , right ' ? Well , detention was kind of like jail . That 's what happened to me . Our planet ... our environment is bullied every single day , and I was just sticking up for it . That kind of make sense ? Yeah , I guess . Hey , so , I have stuff to make peanut butter-and-potato chip sandwiches . Your favorite . I 'll go make you one . Yeah ? You watching this ? No , what ? They lifted the injunction . They 're going to resume drilling . He 's got them in his hand as well . I swear to God , I 'll blow up that well myself . Okay , don 't say that , Em . People 'll think you 're serious . Look , we have other tactics . This is not over . Okay ? I 'll be right there , sweetie , okay ? Listen , I 'll call you right back , okay ? Hey . You heard ? Well , we need to block their access now . No ! Okay Dylan ? I 'll call you back . Ready to go ? Dylan ! Dylan ! Wait ! What 's up , Hank the Tank ? Eric . Remember ? High school ? I remember you ... " Hank the Tank . " Hank the Tank ! I bet you that still gets under your skin , doesn 't it ? Okay , time for you to move back . Look at you now ! All dressed up in your uniform . Protecting what ? Land that 's already supposed to be protected . Does that mean anything to you ? Means something to us , man ! To you , it 's just a job . Is that your excuse ? Yeah . Yeah , that 's my excuse . Guys like me , we actually have to have to work for a living to pay our bills . You should try it sometime . That 's good , man . Thing is , when I wake up in the morning , it 's not the food on my table that I worry about . It 's the clean food and water on everyone 's table ! You should try that , Hank the Tank . Why don 't you try stepping back with your little friends ? They lifted the injunction ! These bastards are gonna start drilling again ! Well ... not here , not now ! Not here , not now ! Not here , not now ! Morning , Ana . Hey ! I made eggs . Your first full day back in a while , so you 'll need a ... you 'll need a good breakfast . Thanks . Talk to Mr. Larson yet ' ? He 's going to get back to me . Really ? You know , when I spoke with him , he said that , they 're short a couple nurses , and he really wants you back . Ana , stop . It was today . I know . I know it was today . Of course , I know that . Just ... come on . Don 't . Don 't set the plate . I just need to . Okay ? Okay I don 't have to go in , you know . I could call them . I think it 's great you 're going back to work today , Hector . - They 'll understand . - Take your mind off things . Today is a good day for you to go back to work . I 'll be fine . I will . I know that you think this has been too long . I just ... have to do it my way , you know ? It 's not too long . Listen , it 's never gonna be too long . I just thought that if you went back to work , It 'd be a good thing . You 'll get a chance to put your mind on other things , too . Yeah , but I don 't want my mind on other things . And I know you don 't understand that , Hector . I do , though . Ana , I understand . Welcome back , Hector . How 's she doing , Glen ? Valves are open . Smooth so far . Have we pushed past that granite yet ? Yeah . So far , It 's moving through that substrata faster than we thought . Good . How 's the heat ? Below levels . Beautiful . We keep this pace up , we could end up with a fat bonus in our pockets . Bonus ? Yeah . I spoke with Mr. Booth this morning . He 's really happy with the programs over here . Yeah . This is the easy part , Hector . We got a ways to go before we reach the target . We 'll get there . You felt that , obviously ? - What was that ' ? - I don 't know . Heat , pressure , viscosity , it 's all reading normal . Let 's just check the condenser valve here . It 's a little low , but we 're still in the green . Could be a lateral plate . The gauge would 've picked that up . Unless ... No , no , if it says it 's normal , it 's normal . Hector ... You and I both know once we reach past ... Shut up ! You and I both signed our name in the same place , right ? - Right ? - Yeah . Okay But I 'm starting to feel like I 'm getting second thoughts . Glen ... Stop ! I think people should know what we 're doing up here . We 've all been out of work a couple of years here , all right ? We need this now . Don 't go doing anything stupid . You got it ? - Got it . - Got it . Let 's get back on it . The location of the aneurism won 't allow for endovascular coiling , Which would 've been less invasive . Sorry . That leaves surgical clipping as our only option , Otherwise the pressure in the aneurism is gonna continue to build until it bursts It 's a procedure that allows us to essentially channel the blood around the other blood vessels . Will it work ' ? Well , there 's risk ... particularly where it 's positioned , and there could be side-effects . But you 've got a ticking time bomb in there , Matthew . I want to schedule this for no later than Wednesday . Jesus , Dave , how ... How risky ? We got plans on Thursday . It could take a year before it bursts , or it could be a week . But it will burst . This is your best option I 'm sorry , I have to take this . Hello ? This is Matthew . How many ? Yeah . I can be there in an hour . Look , tell them to stay away from there , okay ? Alright . Thanks . Bye . Sorry . I have to go . It 's an emergency . I 'll call you from the road . Thanks . All right . Have a good night , Jim . Hector ! Yeah . Haven 't seen you in awhile . How 's it going up there at the well ? Pretty good so far , I guess . Well , that 's good . It 's nice to see you guys up and running again . Maybe people will come around and start spending some money . - There you go . Cheers . - Cheers . Want another ? Yeah . Why not ? What 's eating you , man ? Dev . Five years ago today . Just let him drink . - Cheers , bro . - On me . Hey , Chris . Hey , buddy , thanks . How 's Glen working out ? He holding his own ? Yeah . Pretty good . He knows what he 's doing . Well , if he starts slacking off , let me know and I 'll straighten him out . Yeah , I 'll do that . Hector ... I didn 't mean to surprise you like this . I just got out last week . I 've tried calling you a few times . Nobody wants you in here , man . I 'm talking to my brother , Chris . Is he talking to you ? Go back out the way you came in . Every day , man . Every day , Hector , every day , I live with it . Yeah ? Me too . Ana ' ? I saw Samuel . He 's out , and he 's back in town here . I don 't want to hear his name mentioned again in this house . Ana ... He 's my brother . Well , he 's not my family . Not anymore . Excuse me , sir . Learn the truth about Trans Nova . Thank you . Have a good day . Excuse me . No ? Learn the truth about Trans Nova Oil . Thank you . I 'll take one . Hi . Can we talk ? Emily , it 's been ' lo years . Even just a " hello " would be a good start . What are you even doing here ? Why are you in Paxton ? For you , ironically . The injunction , the protests ... I 'm the head of the company . I have to be here . But I knew that you would be here , and I wanted to come . And Dylan . I haven 't even met my own grandson . It wasn 't me that hasn 't returned the phone calls . It 's not me that doesn 't want to talk to you . I see you 're still angry at me , but it 's been years , Emily . Yes , you 're right , Dad , I am still angry . You can read all about it . Yeah , we 're on a conference call tomorrow with Representative Hennessey . What , how do I know he 's gonna come to the protest ? Because I promised him a case of beer Look , let me call you back . Okay ? Okay . Bye . That was Lisa . She 's got dozens committed to the sit-in over at Indian Creek . Yeah ? So why can 't she get a couple of dozen people at the Paxton Well ' ? Sorry . Well , the fire 's sort of burning itself out on that one . Yeah , because we 're letting it . Okay , well , what else can we do ? We can come up with something else . This can 't be perceived as a personal vendetta against your father , Em . You think that 's what this is about ? Seriously ? Everything that I have worked for ' ? - Everything that I 've sacrificed ? - Of course not . You 're just as passionate about this as anyone else here , but there is not so much as a coffee stain up there . Look , we know their past violations , and how many times have they just walked away from their messes before ? This is ... This is not going to be any different . And that 's his pattern , isn 't it ? Walk away ? Leave a mess ? Don 't they all ? Em . Screw you . What time ? Hey . Can I talk to Dylan ? I just wanted to say hello . Well , I 'm allowed to talk to him on the phone , Todd . Okay , I 'm sorry . Look , will you please just have him call me ? Yeah , I really feel bad about what happened . It won 't happen again . Em . Jerry just heard on his police scanner something about a bunch of dead cows out on a farm near Maple Grove . Maybe you just got what you 're looking for . I 'll go and check it out . Matthew , thanks for coming . No problem . What 've we got ? Dead livestock . We think it might be some kind of gas , but I don 't know , I 've never seen anything like this . They were alive not more than 15 minutes before I found them like this . Do me a favor . Keep your family away from here , would you ? Ricky ! Back in the house . Hey , Dean , stand up . Stand up . C02 hovers in low pockets , like bubbles , it 'll kill you in seconds . Dad ? Dad ! Dad , the dog ! It 's gas ! Get up ! Hey , hey , hey , hey ! Don 't do that ! - Stand up ! ' Ricky ! Stop ! Get him out of here ! No , no , no . What 's that for ? Just stand back . C02 's heavier than air . This smoke should help us see where the gas pockets are . How long do we have to stay away ? I don 't know . Until we find out where it 's coming from , it 's just too dangerous . This is an unusual thing to happen , though , right ? Hasn 't been lately . Look , I 'm going to request a geothermal reading , see if we can 't pinpoint where this thing vented . The gas seems to be dissipating a little bit already . - I 'll try to come back tomorrow . - Sounds good . Dr. Cooper ! Do you have any idea what killed these cows ? Think it has something to do with the dead fish ? Ma 'am , you 'll have to leave . This is private property . - It was gas , wasn 't it ? - Right ? Do you know where it 's coming from ? We don 't know . Soil and water samples won 't come back for a couple more days ... but there was no contamination last time . What do you mean , last time ? In closer to Maple Grove . People have been getting sick , but the samples all come back clean . Something ain 't right around here , but it beats the hell out of me . - Ma 'am . - Yeah . So , how many cases ? Two were transported in serious condition . Others seemed to move through it rather quickly . And you don 't think that it could be salmonella or e-coll ? Children , and the elderly in particular , are still getting sick , but only here . It hasn 't affected anyone else outside this area . What about the CDC ? It 's not contagious . Whether it 's in the air or the ground , I don 't know . But I also don 't know what else to do . Well , I was told your office was responsible for the testing . Our department was responding to a State request . We collected samples , yes . Well , what about the actual testing ? Let me see . In this case , it was contracted out to a private lab . Why is that ? Well , quite often , we have to . We don 't have the resources to handle every case . Okay , well , does the State Regulatory Services monitor the testing ? Well , they adhere to all regulations , of course . What 's the name of the lab ? Hold on . Company called GenCo , based out of Atlanta . Okay . Well , thank you . Sure . I just can 't tomorrow . No , I understand , but I have things I have to get off my plate here . No , no new symptoms . Do you understand that we 've had two major vents in the last 48 hours ? Yeah . Monday could work . Sure . Thank you . Suggests an unusual seismic pressure release ? I understand . No activity , no stress . Got it . Alright . Thanks , Doc . Bye . Okay . Thank you very much . So , we need approval from USGS for a satellite thermal reading , which could take two or three days . What 's Monday ? Just a follow-up . What 'd the doctor say ' ? That I shouldn 't be concerned . Just migraines . Why are you lying , Matthew ? Why don 't you go check with CalTech on any new seismic activity ? Our remote sensors might 've missed ? So , GenC0 's parent company is YVX Enterprises . And who sits on the board of YVX ? A man named Ronald Forge , who also sits on the board of Trans Nova Oil . It gets better . YVX has holdings in several research companies , two of which , Lycon and QHTT , they received grant funding from ... Trans Nova . You have one guy sitting on both boards ? That doesn 't prove that he cooked the research findings . It 's hardly circumstantial . They have oversight . It 's not like they 're operating in a vacuum . Well , what about Lycon and QHTT ? Corporations offer research grants all the time to all sorts of companies . Now , Lycon , they 're working on ways to break down oil compounds for better clean-up . So , you just you think this whole thing is a coincidence ? The dead cows , fish ? People getting sick ? And the company that 's supposed to determine whether or not there 's any contamination has ties to Trans Nova ? We 've filed 13 lawsuits against Trans Nova . They 've heard it all . E.P.A. reports on the drill are clean , and they 're not friendly with oil companies . Until you can prove a link to all this , - it 's not enough . - Why can 't we just say there is ? You know , we put them on the defensive . The more they have to explain themselves , the more guilty they 're gonna sound . It 's unethical . No . What they 're doing is unethical . Thought you believed that . I 'll need the rest of the E.P.A. documents by Monday . Ask to Jeanine , she 'll have them ready . Alright . Hey ! Excuse me ? Emily ? Is there anyone who isn 't on your payroll ? He 's an advisor . We hired him to comply with federal regulations , as we 've always done . Right . Are you paying off the labs as well ? The testing in Maple Grove ? GenCo ? You know , people are getting sick , Dad , so why don 't you try telling the truth for once ' ? Do you think that 's something we would do ? Everyone is watching Trans Nova , every company wants to emulate what you 're doing here , so , yes , I think that 's something you would do . What 's a few sick people and some dead cows when there 's billions at stake , right ? You 're not that ignorant , Emily . You drive a car , like everyone else . You heat your home . People take it for granted , they expect it . They bitch and moan when gas goes up another nickel . They vilify our profits , but we have invested more funding in green energy than any company in the world . We ... We see the writing on the wall ! But it 's not going to happen overnight . The world needs oil . Cheap oil ! And guess what ? Clean oil . That 's what you wanted . That 's what we 're delivering . Yeah , you 're right . I 'm not that ignorant . And I know you 'll get that oil at any cost . But , you know , when people can 't breathe the air , or drink their own water , when is the cost too high ? Anything ? Well , these two anomalies ... although unusual , not unheard of , I 'm just having a hard time making a connection here . Well , I don 't believe in coincidences . Yeah , well , life is a coincidence , so . Oh , come on . You don 't believe that . You think all of this is just one big accident ? Well , tell you what . When there 's a few less stupid people on the planet , I 'll give your theory on Intelligent Design a little more thought . Intelligent or not , there 's definitely gotta be design to it . Why ? Well , I 'm ... I 'm not saying that we don 't make choices . I mean , look at me . But why do I make these choices ? Cause it 's all been worked out by something , or someone , well beyond our grasp . And what about all the people who draw the short straw ? Who decides that ? That 's the mystery , Doc . That 's been the conundrum since we started walking upright . We need to petition USGS for more sensors , keep a closer eye on any new activity . You 're fun . Do it . A beer , please . You 've got some balls , man . Why do you show your face in this town ? Cause I live here . Got as much right as you do . I 'll have a draft . I think a draft beer sounds great . I 'll take one of those , Devon . Frickin ' tree-hugger . Thank you . Cheers . Do you know who I am ? Samuel Janen . Five years ago , you took seven tourists into the old mines without authority . Four of them died from poisonous gas . It was manslaughter , wasn 't it ? Involuntary . One was them was your brother 's eight-year-old son . Thanks for the beer . Hey . Look . Just wait . Please ? What do you want , lady ? To ask you some questions . People are getting sick , and I think it has something to do with the Paxton well . You , more than anybody , might know what 's happening . It was an accident , what happened . I think everybody knows that . Do they ? So then why did you come back ? I have my reasons . May have been five years , but it was a life sentence for what I did . Living somewhere else isn 't going to change that . You were a miner . You knew every inch of those tunnels . How could that much gas have been leaking without you knowing ? There was a tremor that morning . I felt it , just like I 'd felt a hundred like it before . There was never any problem , but that morning , there was gasses that vented into the one tunnels that I didn 't test , the only one I didn 't test , and before I knew it , it was too late . I carried him ... I held him in my arms when I got out . There was oxygen in the truck , and I did everything I could . They had to pr ... They had to pry him out of my hands . For five years , that prison cell felt like ... it felt like those tunnels caving in every night . I 've spent my whole life underground , and now I can 't so much as walk into a bar without feeling the walls crashing in . I sleep outside ... so I can feel the wind and know that the air is clean . I 'll never go back down there again . I 'm sorry . I don 't know your brother , but ... maybe this needs to happen between the two of you , on his terms . Well , you asked why I came back . So , you ... you think that it was a tremor that caused the leak ? Volcanic . Volcanic gasses . So these people that are getting sick in Maple Grove , do you think it could be due to an increase in volcanic activity ? Well , it could be . Enough gas to poison people in a mine is one thing , there 's nowhere for it to escape . But above ground it dissipates . Unless it 's ... Unless what ' ? Unless it 's not so dormant . Dylan ? Is this Emily Booth ? Yeah , speaking . Who 's this ? I shouldn 't be talking to you right now . I shouldn 't be talking to anybody . Excuse me . What 's your name ' ? Listen , my name 's not important . What 's important is that I know things that the public doesn 't . Like what ? Like what we 're doing up there . Do you ... Do you mean the Paxton Well ? So , what ? So , what , do you work there ls the well causing the gas leaks ? No , you don 't get it . The gas leaks , they 're nothing compared to what could happen . I 'm not an expert , I don 't really know , but at these depths ... Are you ... Are you drilling deeper than permitted ? Look , why don 't we talk ' ? We can meet face-to-face . They 're lying to the public . Alright ? It 's all a bunch of lies . Hello ' ? Hello ! Dr. Cooper ? Dr. Cooper , open up ! It 's important . I 'm sorry for the way that I spoke to you the other day , but I really need to talk to you . May I come in ? Looks like you already have . Spring cleaning ? Yeah , something like that . What can I do for you ? During the Senate hearing , you said that there was a danger drilling to certain depths in this area . Why ? Engineers use thermal technology to find oil deposits . Unfortunately , oil can be easily mistaken for compressed magma . You tap into a magma chamber , and you could set off an eruption . And you think that could happen here ? In theory , but it 's unlikely . Why is that ? Well , depth , for one . They 're not drilling deep enough to reach magma . Number two , it would pretty much take a perfect scenario of , you know , compressed magma , drill points , chamber vents , etc . But the gasses that we 've seen here recently , isn 't that evidence of that kind of scenario ? Well , there are a lot of scenarios that have nothing to do with that drill . Maybe you 're trying to connect dots that don 't exist . Well , aren 't you trying to connect those same dots ? I mean , you were concerned out at that farm . Or are you just doing another report for Trans Nova Oil ? Okay . Thank you very much . Okay , no , I 'm sorry . What ... what if I have proof that they 're drilling deeper than permitted ? Look , I check the E.P.A. reports every day . They 're not , alright ? They 're doing everything to code . I know I can be rude , and I know I can be pushy , and I even know I 'm wrong half the time , I don 't think I 'm wrong with this . There 's something happening at that well . If I 'm wrong , I 'll walk away , they can take as much oil as they want . If I 'm right , we could be standing on a ticking time bomb . And you think you can prove this ? Yeah , with your help . So , looking for what vented the C02 that killed the fish , there was a small substrate shift at 20,000 meters . Measured at 3.7 . The hypocenter was directly under the well site , but that was just over five months ago . And the drill was shut down when ? April 22nd . Earth Day . Well , that event could 've easily have released the C02 that eventually found its way to the lake . But now check this out . The incident at the farm ? Almost the exact same event . 20,000 meters . Are you sure that 's all this guy had to say ? Yeah . Just he thought that they were drilling at depths that could be dangerous . Doc , E.P.A. " Doc ? " Cute . Daniel , what do you got ? Well , I took another look . We have an hourly monitor on the well site and their specs are at code or above . Well , has there been a physical inspection ? Yeah. last week . Nobody 's climbing down there with a tape measure , if that 's what you mean . But the computers don 't lie . We have double-redundancy on the Paxton well . There 's an insider at the well who says they 're drilling deeper than 10,000 meters . Seriously ? What can I say ? I mean , either the computer 's lying or he is . We stand by our monitoring , Matthew . Alright . We 'll get back to you . Thanks . So , you sure it wasn 't some crackpot who just wants to say anything to shut down the well ? Yes , I 'm sure . Well , if we don 't have him , we don 't have a link . Dylan ! Hey ! Hey , you . I 'm really sorry about the other day . I ... I got you something . I put a bunch of games on here . There 's an account , if you want to get more . Dad said I can 't have a phone , and they 're not allowed at school . One more detention , and I could get suspended . Okay , well , let 's just keep it between us until I talk to your dad , okay ? Just promise you 'll answer if I call . I will . Mom ' ? Thanks . This is cool . You 're welcome . - Hello ? - Can you meet me ? Yeah ! Where ' ? Hector , keep an eye on number four compressor . It was tweaking a little earlier . It 's reading " normal " now . Alright . I got a dentist appointment . Dentist ? What , now ? Yeah . I gotta go , man . Alright . - Hey . - You didn 't answer your phone . Yeah , I have to be in Portland in the morning . He called back . He wants to meet . Who 's he ? This is Matthew Cooper , he 's a geologist . He needs to hear this . Cooper ' ? He works for Trans Nova Oil . Wait a second ! I signed off on that well I need to know the truth . Alright . Listen . Nobody cares about the oil at 10,000 meters . They 're after the oil at 25,000 . There 's enough there to rival the Middle East . How could they be drilling that deep without anyone knowing ? Every piece of data that comes from that well site , all the pertinent information like the depths , temperature , volume , friction it all comes through the computers . Now , those computers have been reprogrammed to say anything that Trans Nova Oil wants them to say . The data 's wrong . Yeah , well , that ... I mean , that violates every single code Who cares what it violates ? Once we start pulling oil from those reserves , cleanly and safely , there 's not an administration in the world that could put that toothpaste back in the tube . Trans Nova Oil will be happy to pay the fine . 25,000 meters , are you sure ? Yeah . Yeah . I run the drill . I 'm one of two people at the site who knows . Yeah , well , your geologists got it wrong . I did my own analysis when they built that thing . What they think they 're seeing at 25,000 meters isn 't oil , it 's magma , potentially compressed magma . Even with the most sophisticated equipment in the world , it 's tough to tell the difference . Well , there was vibration . It could ... It could be that it was , subterranean interference .. You know , it could 've been a natural tremor . Our indicators say normal , But I 'm convinced it 's something else , a reaction of trapped gas . I 've felt it before , not-not quite like this , but ... Yeah . I think we 're getting pretty close to something very big . I gotta get outta here . We have to go public with this . I can 't do that . I can 't do that . You try to force me to do that , I 'll deny everything . I 've given you all I have . Go figure it out . So 25,000 meters ? Assume it 's a substrate compression , highly compressed . Is that magma ? Well , that 's what they think is the oil deposit . How can they not know the difference ? Well , this-this method of extraction is new . They start with thermal detection , but , you know , that can only go so deep . The rest is calculated with state-of-the-art software , but the variables are the same . Right . So how do you tell if it is magma ? Depth , compression , other gasses we 've been able to test . Experience . I certainly hope I 'm Wrong . You know , most people think that when lava gets out , that 's when the pressure 's released . Well , that 's not always true . It 's the release of underground gasses that can increase combustion and cause a chain reaction . Along the entire caldera ... which doesn 't necessarily make one big boom , it could set off 50 small ones . Did my homework . Well , " small " being relative , but still , " small " enough to wipe out five square miles , and multiply that by 50 . - Unless ... - Unless what ? This . Worst-case scenario . The entire caldera erupts , not just a handful of small ones . The last time that happened was 200,000 years ago , and it completely flattened a thousand square miles . It 'll change life as we know it . You can go in now , Hector . Alright . Thank you . Hector . Thanks for coming in after work like this . I 'm sure you 're tired . Come . Have a seat . You want a drink ? Oh , no , thank you . Well , I 'm gonna have one . I 'm up on the daily reports . We 're very happy . I 've meant to come up and see you boys , but there 's always fires to put out down here . We 're still stretching our legs in Paxton . Good people , though . Yeah , I understand that , Mr. Booth . No , no , no . " Oliver , " please . Sit . Okay I don 't want to bring up anything uncomfortable , but someone just told me that you lost a son a few years back . Yeah . I 'm very sorry to hear that . Thank you . I lost my daughter , in a way . Not what you experienced , of course . It was a falling out a long time ago . You probably know who she is . I 've heard of her , yes . Of course you have . It 's no secret . She 's been a thorn in our side ... ever since we proposed this site . How 's that for irony ? An oil man 's daughter is a die-hard environmentalist . Mm . You 've never met ? No . No . I just thought , you know , small town , people know each other . Listen , Hector . The reason that I ask is because you need to realize that if you ever come into contact with Emily , if she ever approaches you , for information , that her motives are not always as righteous as she leads people to believe . As said , I 'm not on her " most admired " list . But look ... we 're in this together . You 've been trusted with sensitive information , which is why you signed the confidentiality agreement , but more importantly , we shook hands , you and I. So , obviously , there won 't be a problem . No , sir . No problem . Good . Hey , say hi to your wife for me . It 's Ana , right ? Yes . Yeah . I will . Alright . Thank you for coming in . You 're welcome . Thank you . So what are you gonna do ? I 'm just gonna go to work and keep my mouth shut . Well , and if your instincts are right ' ? They 're not . I 'm wrong . They 've got millions invested in this thing . They 're not gonna jeopardize everything . Not unless it 's safe . I never should 've contacted her . Well , she doesn 't know who you are ! I don 't know . All that press five years ago . I - I think she recognized me . I don 't know . I 'm getting paranoid . Hey ... We are having a son . What ? Really ? Yes . And I spoke to Mr. Larson about going back to work at the hospital . Just ... Just part-time , until the baby 's born . Now , there 's that smile I 've been missing . You have been so patient with me . I love you . I love you too , baby . Don 't have to feel guilty . It 's 100 % recycled . Come on , man . You can 't be that blind to what 's going on here . Don 't you understand the consequences ? They 're not going to stop with this . They do this here , they can do it everywhere . Then what 's left ? Is that really worth a job with these people ? When I 'm trying to make insurance ? Rent ? Can 't afford to buy a frickin ' birthday present for my little girl ? Yeah . Yeah . It 's worth it . That 's what I lose sleep over . Those are my responsibilities . What do you got ? It 's what I don 't have . Apathy ... Hank the Tank . It still gets under your skin , doesn 't it ? I was one of those guys in high school who called you that . Court order says you all need to be across the street ! Come on , man ! Here 's your chance ! Retribution . " Hank the Tank ! " Hank the Tank ! Hank the Tank ! Yeah ! It 's already posted online ! You lose ! Is Hector available ? No , please . Please , wait . He doesn 't want to talk to you . I know , but it 's really important that I speak with him . Just leave us alone , okay ? I think something is happening at the well , and I think that your husband might be in danger . Just please , have him call me . Hector speaking . She was here . Looking for you . Thanks . Matthew ' ? Yeah . Yeah . I 'm on my way . What we usually look for in the subduction zone is what we call " land-breathing . " It 's ground elevation caused by subterranean pressure . Do you think that 's happening here ? Well , we haven 't seen any , but with all this C02 , it 's definitely worth another look . Even a few inches could be alarming . Your grandfather used to work in the mines , right ? I read that he helped petition the federal government to designate most of this land as a National Preserve . That 's quite the history . When you said this was your backyard , you weren 't kidding . Yeah . My grandfather was a pretty great guy . When I was a kid , he used to bring me rocks , and it could be the most boring , most plain rock you 've ever seen , he had a story for it . Its history , how it connects to everything around us . Used to always say , " it 's not just a rock . It 's not just land . It 's who we are . It 's what will become of us , and it 'll be here long after we 're gone . " I think he wanted that to belong to everyone , you know ? So when Trans Nova moved in , I wanted to be on the inside , to make sure they did things right . Anything ? No . We probably won 't know until we compare it with the satellite imagery , then we 'll ... Did you feel that ? Yeah . Is it an earthquake ? No . I don 't think so . What the hell is that ? Come on . What ? Guys ! We gotta go . Let 's line up . Decide who you 're sitting with . One at a time . Hey ! One at a time . Hey ! Give that back to him . Stop it . Get on now . Let 's go . Come on . Dylan . Come on . Okay , make sure you have your backpacks and lunches . There are bathroom facilities at the park , but it 's about an hour drive , so if you have to go , go now . Once you pick a seat , stick to it until we get there . And remember , no cell phones , video cameras , or iPods , unless you like detention . Dylan , is your mom coming ? I don 't think so . Okay Mr. Booth ? Mr. Booth . - I need to talk to you right away . - Dr. Cooper I 've got some people I 'm going to meet at the Mayor 's office . Can it wait until this afternoon ? No . Actually , there 's a major problem developing at the well . You need to shut it down . I 'm sorry . I thought I heard you say " Shut it down . " - Listen to me . - Hey ! Hey . First of all , you lied to me . You 're drilling deeper than 20,000 meters . But more importantly , what you think is a large oil deposit is , in fact , compressed magma . Now , if you rupture that chamber , you could cause a catastrophic volcanic event . I would be very careful , Dr. Cooper . It doesn 't matter how you slice it , you still signed off on this well . Yeah . That 's exactly right , and that 's why you 're gonna shut it down ! Listen to me ! A magma drop-out opened up less than 10 miles away from here . Do you know what that means ? It is a precursor to a major eruption . We 've already contacted USGS , the Mayor and the Governor . Can you prove this has anything to do with our well ? You 're our expert , Dr. Cooper . I want your professional opinion . I can tell you what I do know . If what 's happening here continues , this entire caldera on which we 're standing right now , where thousands of people go to school , go to work , camp , hike , and fish , is gonna go up in a series of eruptions that 'll make Mount St. Helene look like a fifth-grade science project . Shut it down . Just ... Just listen to me . We have multiple level-four ventings . Dr. Cooper is requesting a geothermal testing of the entire caldera . This is an escalating event that needs immediate attention ! Look , I just ... I can 't authorize something like that without - Sir ? Sir . Just ... take a look outside your window . Just take a look at the bright blue sky , because it 's not gonna be there much longer if you don 't get this done . Without the proper paperwork , there 's nothing I can do . Geez ! Look , if we post this now , there might still be time . Telling people to evacuate Paxton ? It 'll cause a panic . We have to do something . Could you imagine the liability ? The gasses are venting now . And where are the police ? They 're investigating , but there 's still too much red tape . Exactly ! For a reason . Dr. Cooper has already contacted other agencies . He 's ... That guy who works for the oil company ? You 're riding his wave now ? Look . We have to warn people . We 're the only ones that will say what 's actually going on here . No , " we " don 't . I can 't put us out on a limb like that , Emily . Sorry . " She 'll be coming round the mountain . " " when she comes . " " She 'll be coming round the mountain . " Tommy ! Hey . No . " She 'll be coming round the mountain . " " when she comes . " You don 't want to sing , Dylan ? " She 'll be riding six white horses . " " when she comes . " " She 'll be riding six white horses . " So USGS is coming , although they didn 't sound like they were in a hurry . There 's " paperwork " involved . Can they shut down the drilling ? No . No . They 'd have to go through legal channels . By the time Washington gets off their ass it 'll be too late . You okay ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm fine . Look , we need this guy , Hector , okay ? He 's the operations manager at the well . He either needs to come out or shut it down himself . So how do we get to him ? As of now , I still work for them , right ? Let 's go . Hey , Dylan . Anything you want to talk about ? Like what ? Whatever you want . You 're a good student , one of the smartest kids I know , but lately , your grades haven 't really shown that ... or your interest in anything , for that matter . I just want to know what 's going on . Maybe I 'm not that smart . You can talk to me . I think it has to do with your mom , right ? My dad will barely let me see her . And you 're kind of mad about it ? I guess . That 's okay . Tell you what . When we get back , let 's sit down , and you write your parents a note , write it all down , everything you 're feeling , and you can decide if you want to give it to them or not , but if you at least see it for yourself , it 'll help . Trust me . Deal ? Okay In the meantime , why don 't you go collect some more of those spruce cones ? Use them for your class presentation . It 's a pine cone . See ? Back off ! Give them some room ! Another report for the damn E.P.A. , Dr. Cooper ? Yeah . Something like that . My God . Edward , call Mr. Booth . Tell him we 're there sooner than we thought . I 'm on it . I 'm surprised my father hasn 't blocked your access yet . Yeah , but we 're not inside yet . But if Hector doesn 't listen ... We 'll have to find the off-switch Look at the size of it . How 's the pressure ? Normal . Ramp it down . We 've got a spike at 16,000 meters . Thermal readings are racing . Increase viscosity 20 % . 20 % . Still rising . Take it to 40 . 40 ! Where 's our coolant ? It 's there , but we 're losing volume ! Four and five can 't keep up ! Friction levels are still reading the same . - How 's the pressure ? - The same ! Doesn 't make any sense . Where 's the heat coming from ? Maybe we have a bad component . Oh , my God ! Excuse me , Oliver . Can I get you to sign these , please ? All right . This is Oliver . Mr. Booth , we 've had a major breach . We need to detonate and cap now . Well , slow down , Hector . What the hell are you talking about ? We 've drilled into a highly compressed lava chamber . It 's not oil down there . It 's molten lava , it 's coming up the chamber . We need to cap it now . Wait . Can 't you just shut down the valves ? It 's past that . If we wait , the lava moves up , possibly to the inner chamber ... We need to cap it right now . Oliver , that will compromise the entire rig . Hector , we have triple-redundancy there . Detonating the cap is a last resort ... Hector ! Hector ! Initiate detonation . You 're serious ? Just do it . Get them out of there . They 're not picking up ! Get somebody up there . Tell Jeanine to get me on-line with them ! Okay . Right away . Set ? Do it . Turn off those damn alarms now ! Everybody to the top ! Everybody , get to the top , now ! Seal the compartment . Implement safety procedures . Get out now ! Everybody to the top . Come on ! Let 's go ! Make sure the auxiliary vents are on ! Glen ! The pumps are still out ! Why is there smoke ? What 's happening ? Audrey ! Epicenter 10 miles northwest of the well site . I 'm patching into USGS now . Audrey ! Your readings are wrong ! The epicenter 's at the well site ! It 's right on top of us . Audrey ! Everybody , let 's get back on the bus ! Andrea , come on . Let 's go ! Hurry . Come on , guys , let 's go . Base , this is 1-9-8-6 . Glen ! Make sure the valves are open ! Make sure the valves are open ! Do it ! As soon as two goes down , go to system three ! Go manual ! Forget automatic ! Go manual ! It 's accelerating . C02 's off the dial . How are we gonna get outta here ? Just give me a minute . It will be right at the edge of the blast area ! Audrey ! Check the phone lines . Check them . - Anything ? - Nothing . There 's no response . There 's no response ! - Edward ? - There 's nothing . We got to get in there ! There may still be people alive ... Don 't open that door ! They 're dead out there . We try to get out , we 're dead , too . Just take it easy . You can see , behind me here , through the trees , a large plume of ash and it 's very close . We felt a major earthquake just seconds ... No ! I want the control room . Well , keep trying . Has anyone gotten up to the well ? They were 10 minutes away . I tried calling , but they 're not picking up either . Track down the Sheriff . Tell him we had a distress call just moments before we lost all communication . Maybe he 'll send a deputy . And we need to get back online with their computer . Everything 's down . Well , somebody has to figure it out . Those computers may be the only way we 're gonna reach those boys . What are we gonna do about Atlanta ? What about Atlanta ? Well , corporates gonna be wanting us to think about a strategy here , - Oliver . - Strategy ' ? We don 't even know what happened here yet ! Right now , I want eyes and ears on the ground up there . So that we can figure out what happened . The sky 's already darkening , the ash plume rising higher and higher . It 's hard to see here . I 'm trying to get a better view . Pan back to the tree-line . Police are trying hard to get people out of here . And the wind has picked up . And it keeps coming . Come on . Let 's get inside . Where 's Dylan ' ? No , he 's gone ! Dylan ! Dylan ! Dylan ! Come on ! Come on ! Of sulphur . As you can see , there 's a better view Go , go , go , go , go , go ! Audrey ! Matthew ? I - I just got off with CalTech . It 's worse than we thought ! Increased activity throughout the Ring of Fire . The Ring of Fire ? What ... About 75 % of the world 's volcanoes . Hey . Hey . Hey I can 't breathe . Where are the others ? I don 't know where anyone is , I lost them . There is ... there is no one else . Come on . Come on . We gotta go . We gotta go . Come on . Come on ! The well 's gone , Oliver . They 're all gone . Well , still , all communications are down . Then how are they gonna know We 're alive in here ' ? They 're not . My son ... He 's out there . He was on a field trip . Matthew ! Come on ! Close them ! Close the windows . It won 't close ! My window won 't close . Help me ! Mine doesn 't close ! Matthew ! How long do you think that will hold ? I don 't know . The heat sensors are knocked out . There 's no way outta here . - Are you okay ? - Yeah ... Let 's see . Let 's see . No , I 'm fine , Dr. Cooper . No , you 're not fine . Sit down . Sit down . Okay . Volcanic ash is made out of microscopic shards of glass . It 'll get into that wound and out it , it 'll make it fester . We need to clean it , okay ' ? We were lucky . We were on the edge of the blast range . Any closer , and our lungs would already be infected , being cut by that ash with every breath Well , it 's pretty much still like breathing poison . We have to get out of here . How close is too close ? You mean for your son ? Yeah . Look , the best thing we can do is get back into town . I 'm sure he 's there , at the school , okay ? Come on . Come on . Is anybody hurt ? Tommy 's hurt . - Oh , no ! - Oh , no , Tommy 's hurt ! Does anyone have a picnic blanket ? I have one . ORGY- - ... Under his head . Hello ? Can anybody hear this ? Why are these geysers happening here ? The eruption was miles away . Well , a caldera is basically like a giant volcano crater . It can spread for miles . When it erupts , it doesn 't just erupt in one place , like a stratovolcano , like Mount St. Helene , it can erupt in many different places , basically wherever that compressed magma can find a way out . Right . So these geysers , they 're , like , smaller explosions ? Essentially . And the Ring of Fire ? The Ring of Fire stretches from Yellowstone to Indonesia . It 's about 75 % of the world 's volcanoes . Now , there is a scenario that 's improbable but possible , where an eruption could trigger the rest . And if that happens ? It 's what 's called an " E.L.E. " " Extinction-level event " All right , Audrey , ready for calibration . I am seeing a major sub-surface CO2 spike . The drill site is located on a national preserve which is already one strike against us . Jobs and the environment ... this community cares about both , That 's how we get the injunction lifted . Dead livestock . I 've never seen anything like this . Dr. Cooper ... Do you have any idea what killed these cows ? It was gas , wasn 't it ? You know , people are getting sick , Dad , so why don 't you try telling the truth for once ' ? The pressure on the aneurysm is going to continue to build until it bursts . We got the votes . We 're back up and running . There 's something happening at that well . If I 'm right we could be standing on a ticking time bomb . Do you feel that ' ? Mr. Booth No . Actually , there 's a major problem developing at the well . You need to shut it down . What you think is a large oil deposit is , actually compressed magma . If you rupture that chamber , you could cause a catastrophic volcanic event . Doesn 't matter how you slice it , you still signed off on this well . That 's exactly right , and that 's why you 're gonna shut it down ! Mr. Booth , we 've had a major breach . What the hell are you talking about ? We need to cap it now . Detonating the cap is a last resort ... Come on , let 's go ! Let 's get back on the bus . The Ring of Fire stretches from Yellowstone to Indonesia . It 's about 75 % of the world 's volcanoes . One eruption could trigger the rest . And if that happens ? It 's what 's called an " E.L.E. " " Extinction-level event " completely blocked by the haze , and it does appear to be getting worse and ... continues to spew ash and smoke into the sky . Authorities are trying to get through to the affected areas , but ... breaking news that a major volcanic eruption has gone off within the Oregon ... still several miles away , but you can see the ash is now spewing upward with great ferocity . Now , we can only imagine what it 's like for those who are actually close to ... One witness tells us ... The eruption itself is still several miles away , but you Once again , we can tell you Here are the first images from central Oregon . Again , a major volcanic eruption has rocked the In fact , the sun now is being completely blocked by the haze . All of this has become the focus of rescue efforts throughout the area We 're getting reports that federal authorities are working from Paxton , which remains out off but , at this time , there 's little that can be done but to wait for Mother Nature to take its course . We need a list of who was at the well . Their families are going to start calling . We need to know who they are . Yes , sir . Now we are getting reports that the entire town of Maple Grove has been completely destroyed . Now , a helicopter pilot we spoke to says he 's seen more than just this eruption . In fact , several eruptions through the caldera How old 's your boy ? He 's nine . Does he live with you ? No , I , I lost custody . His father 's a very good lawyer . He 's also a jerk . I 'm sorry to hear that . Are we going to make it out of this ? I don 't know . Well , isn 't this one of those situations when you 're supposed to lie ? Well , I 've never really been in one of those situations , so ... Matthew ? Matthew ! Hold it , hold it ! Let 's go . Go ! Go ! Come through , come through ! That 's it ! Keep going , keep going , keep going ! Sheriff , I 'm going to need a power genny and a satellite uplink to Caltech USGS and the Emergency Response Association . I 'm also going to need you to liaise with Health Services . We 've got to make sure we can get these victims taken care of . The hospital is down , sir . Backup generator is gone as well . Okay , see if you can get your guys to ID and secure a triage . Get all available health supplies you can . - We 're going to need them . - Yes , sir . Hey . You okay ? Yeah . Yeah . What the hell was that ? I 'm fine ... I 'm fine . Look , we can 't keep breathing this stuff . We have to move on . All right , we 're going to have to break through that . Are you ready ? Let 's go . Come on , come on ... Everybody , I know you 're scared , but it 's going to be okay . Dylan and Paul ? Reach up and make sure the windows are shut tight . Andrea , I need you to check all the backpacks for food and water , okay ? Okay Put any blankets or jackets on the floor to cover the windows . Watch out for the glass . I can 't find my jacket . Is anyone else hurt ? Oh , I 've got a jacket . Here 's my jacket . There 's supposed to be oxygen tanks here . They never restocked after we started up again . How much air do we have left ? A few hours , tops . Not quite so normal now , is it , Hector ? How many others ? Including us ? But you still have your job , don 't you ? You still have that ! Hey , come on ! You still have that ! Guys ! Guys ! Relax ! Made the 911 call before the communications were knocked out . But even if they find us , there 's no way they can get to us ! Is there ? Finished . We have to keep that area clear . Mr. Stromwall ? Audrey Lee . We spoke on the phone . Audrey . You have the data ? Yeah , it 's right here . Let 's have a look . This is the latest from our satellites . Our own sensors are still giving us a pretty good idea of where the activity is centered . We 're right here , and the epicenter is right here , about 20 miles . The well site is right here . Okay , what 's the distance ? Approximately halfway between us and the epicenter . Now , when they punctured the magma , they pressurized four of the chambers , which we 've identified , and this was the first to go . There 's going to be more . So , what about this ? I think the lava has been expelled from the drill site itself , so we 're seeing lots of steam . It 's also trying to get out through other natural vents , but , God , there 's so much ash in the air that we 're losing our imaging . Okay , the DOD is moving a thermal satellite into position as we speak . It 's going to give us a better set of eyes . Yeah . We need you to upload this data to our equipment , ASAP . Yeah . Barbara Zimmerman , CalTech . Glad you made it through . Are you still linked up with California ? They 're feeding us live data . We 've got new satellite imagery coming in as well . Hold on . It 's showing a new event . Depth of 15,400 meters . Registering at 3.7 . Looks like another eruption . That 's sizable . Seven miles from the original event . What 's the population out there ? It 's sparse . It 's a mostly rural area . Ana . What do you want ? I want to know if Hector 's okay . You 're not welcome here , Samuel . - I know ... - I 'm sorry . I know , I know , I 'm just worried about Hector . Was he at the well ? Just leave . You can 't stay here . They 're evacuating the town . I am not leaving Paxton until he comes home . And I 'm asking you one more time , Samuel . Please , just leave . There 's a walkway right here , it 's mostly contained , that branches off from that vent right up there . No . No , that vent is sealed . It 's sealed at the back , where it connects to the internal air ducts . 20 feet in from there , it branches off , takes us to the walkway , right here . Where does that take us ? The walkway will take us to the upper complex . But that 's ... there 's no outside access here . We 'd be trapped the same as we are here . No , from the upper complex , there 's a ventilation shaft ... right here ... take us right into the mines . That is , if the mines are still intact . Well , that 's a big assumption . Look , it 's either that or we stay here and suffocate . And what if the upper complex is contaminated with that ? We die quicker . Just take a sip of water and pass it on , but just one . We have to conserve it . - Thanks . - Here . Now , I know I said no cell phones , - but did any of you bring one ' ? - No . I promise you won 't get in trouble . No . My god . What the hell is that ? Switch to wider . This is no longer contained . The Ring of Fire is active . The whole damn world 's about to catch fire . You 've reached Emily Booth with All Earth Foundation . Please leave me a message . Emily , it 's me . This is the only number I have for you . I need to know that you 're okay . And Dylan ? If you don 't want to call me , call my office . Oliver , we 've got to get to the airport . The G5 jet is on its way . Lawyers are waiting for us in Atlanta . Well , they can wait . We have got some serious damage control to do . - It cannot wait ... - Damage control ? The damage is done . The damage out there . Well , I know that , Oliver , but we 've got to get prepared for this . My daughter and my grandson are out there . Look , the roads are jammed . The G5 is the only way out . They are not going to take off without you . You are putting our lives at risk if you will not leave now . Do your damage control , I 'll do mine . Oliver ! Hold that . Hold that , hold the light . I can 't do this . There 's no way . I can 't do this . There 's not a lot of other options . No , I don 't ... I 'm claustrophobic . And not just a little . What ? Well , what you 're going to be is dead , Glen , if you stay here . Come on , this is the only way out ... I can 't do this . Yes , you can . It 's gonna be all right . Just imagine , like , a beach , or a lake or something ... Oh , Montana . Montana ? Yeah . Lot of open spaces . Come on , let 's go . Come on , you can do this . Get in . You can do it , man . Reports now that the second eruption was part of a larger extended eruption , experts saying there could be more . But in fact this entire ... They won 't let anyone through . They just said on the news they 're calling in the National Guard . You think they 're gonna make our boys up there a priority ' ? They 'll leave them up there to die . Look , Chris , I just overheard the guys in the tent say there 's no one alive within five miles of that well . The whole area went up . There was a 911 distress from the well after the eruption . I worked construction on that rig . This is the well head . This is the operations room . It can be sealed off . It 's built to withstand a nuclear blast . It doesn 't matter , there 's no way to even get close to that well . This is the third part here , we called it " the upper complex , " the guts of the rig . There 's a five-mile lateral ventilation tunnel that goes outward from the upper complex . There 's at least three or four entry points . That 's how we get to them . Look , Chris , the whole place is a furnace . Even getting to these access points is impossible . You don 't have to . Just hear me out ... I don 't need to listen to a damn word you say ... Well , you 're going to listen , Chris , because I 'm going to go find my brother . I 'm going to get him out , and I can 't do it by myself . We can access the upper complex through the mines . I know I 'll never pay enough for what I did , but I know these mines . I know them . I can trace them , I know where they start , where they stop ... They used to use them as natural ventilation , right up into the guts of the rig . Hector 's boy was my godson . And he was my nephew . I loved him . I can 't bring him back . The least you could do is just help me bring Hector home . Okay ? Why are they just sitting here like this ? It 's gas . Before the eruption . C02 at those levels would kill you almost instantly . They had no chance . Hey . I know . We 'll bring it back . Let 's go . My God , look at all of these people . Where are they all going to go ? I don 't know . Right now you should be worried . about finding your son If it 's this bad out here , can you imagine how bad it is in town ? I 've got to get back to the command center , see if there 's any news on USGS or CalTech . - Everybody go to the side . - Let 's go . Let 's go . You saved my life out there . Thank you . Go find your son . Okay We can 't stop here . I have to , man . It 's poison , isn 't it ? You know , my nose still hurts , man . Good . You were wrong about something . Yeah ? You never called me " Hank the Tank " in high-school . Frank Rinelli did . He was going to kick my ass . You threatened to kick his . I don 't remember that . I do . Audrey . Matthew . - Are you okay ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . You scared me . Dr. Cooper ? Harry Stromwall . - Welcome . - Thank you . So , what can you tell us from the ground ? Well , there 's a lot of venting , more than I 've ever seen . Mostly C02 , but there 's a lot more that wants to get out . Are we getting anything from our thermal satellite readings ? Yes , unfortunately , the lava field is continuing to grow , larger than any initial measurements showed . It 's actually expanding . Paxton is now well within its perimeter . We 're also getting reports of seismic activity up and down the Western seaboard . Dylan ? Todd ... Todd ! Where 's Dylan ' ? He 's not with you ? No , he was on a field trip . Yeah , I know . They 're not back . They didn 't come back . I just assumed that you had taken him somewhere else instead . We 've all been waiting here . Nobody has told us anything . It 's okay . It 's okay , it 's okay ... A third eruption , less than six miles . Hang on ! Move your vehicle . Now . Let 's go ! From our office in California . It 's somewhat crude , but between the satellite thermal imagery and our own substrate sensors , it 's given us a better look . It 's looking for another way out , and we 're it . So , how long have we got ? This was four hours ago . The increase in lava elevation has been consistent . I 'm guessing 24 hours . How accurate is that ? This technology is light years ahead of anything we 've ever had . It 's going to be pretty close . Yeah ? Thank you . They just shut down Route 15 . 15 's the only way in or out . Every other road leads to the epicenter of those eruptions . Miss Preston ? Yes , Dylan ? Dylan ! why didn 't you say anything ? My mom gave it to me , and I didn 't want her to get into any more trouble . She 's not going to get in trouble , sweetheart . Come on . Come on . Emily ... The bus driver called in right after the eruption . They had just left Rec Park . We have to do something . There 's nothing we can do . I can 't just sit here . Emily ... The air is toxic . The roads are closed , and we don 't even know where he is . Now , if they 're mobile , they 're on their way . And all information is going to come. through here Okay Okay Who 's that ? - What ? - I can 't ... Keep going forward . I can 't do this ! - Take a breath , Glen . - Come on , man , keep moving . I can 't do this , I can 't do this ... - Keep going ! - Keep moving ! I gotta get outta here . Keep going . We 've gotta go ! I 've gotta get out of here now ! I 've gotta get out of here now ! - Glen ! - I 've gotta get out of here now ! I 've gotta get out of here now ! Glen , no . Glen ! Glen ! Look at me ! Stop , stop ! Look at me ! Hey , hey , stop it . Stop ! Stop ! Stop . Look at me . Calm down ... Calm down . Calm down . Your girlfriend 's waiting for you , Glen . Your family , they 're all waiting for you outside . Now , take it easy . Calm down . Look at me , look at me . Keep it together . Calm down . Okay ? Okay ? Okay ? Calm down ... Calm down . Okay , wait here . Wait here . Stay there . I 'm going to give you some room . That 's it . Come on , buddy . Keep going . So , each increase on CalTech 's crystal ball , and there 's increased activity from Yellowstone to the Aleutians . We 're getting a chain reaction throughout the entire network . Can you use the same prediction model ? Not as precise . We just don 't have feeds into all those areas . I 've sent this information to CalTech . They have a broader range . Can you bring it up for us ? Yeah . These increases along the Ring of Fire , are they at the same trajectory ? So far . If you ask me , if the one we 're sitting on goes , so goes the rest of the world . Our imaging shows the same increase from Yellowstone into the Aleutians . It doesn 't appear to be stopping at just one . Agree . The Ring of Fire is moving toward sizable activity . Then we are in fact facing an Extinction Level Event . So , how the hell do we stop it ' ? Doc , what are you thinking ? She has asthma . Do you have your inhaler ? Just hang on . See you now . Audrey , bring up our data on the Miyakejima event . All right , Guys What we have here ... well , what mother nature has here ... is a very sophisticated network of caves and tunnels , very much like veins and arteries . And in these arteries is molten rock , where the pressure is constantly increasing . Now , our magma chamber was punctured here , and that relieved some of the pressure , resulting in the eruptions we saw here , here and here . Unfortunately , as CalTech has informed us , that pressure is still building . It is now pushing the magma upward . So we need to cap it ? No , we 'd risk collapsing the magma chamber onto itself , and that would only increase combustion . Okay , the Miyakejima event in Japan . Now , at first , it was only a phreatic explosion , only lasted a few minutes . But down below , the magma intrusion was broadening and the pressure was increasing quite dramatically until , all of a sudden , a fissure opened up with the chamber and created a type of thermal drain all the way to the ocean . Now , obviously there were several undersea eruptions and explosions , but , eventually , that magma cooled , and we avoided a pretty catastrophic event . So , what if , in our scenario , we were able to create a similar type fissure ? I mean , there 's a chance we could divert all of this liquid magma away from our chamber . I mean , literally like pulling the plug on a bathtub . - To the ocean ? - Yeah . Doc , Miyakejima was a massive seismic occurrence . How can you possibly expect to duplicate that ? Well , we 'd obviously have to use some type of explosive , right ? Okay , but you 're going to have a very limited outward burst with any kind of incendiary bomb that far underground . - What about a sonic bomb ? - Come again ? I know the military used them under the mountains of Afghanistan . Look , rock is a great amplifier . In essence , what we 'd be doing is creating a massive sonic boom and letting that shock wave travel through the rock as far as it can . In Afghanistan , these things toppled caves and tunnels that were miles away from the detonation point . So , if we could pick the right target , at the right depth , I mean , there 's a chance we could create our own chain reaction , opening fissures all along the way , and giving our magma a free run to the Pacific . Okay , and exactly how do you expect to deliver your sonic bomb to the right fissure ? Call Trans Nova back over here and have them drill another hole ? We don 't have to . The pit crater back at the farm . Here . Thermal readings have shown that there 's an entry point into a fissure . This is the one we want . Now , obviously , we 'd have to use some sort of time-delay detonation , encase it in something that could withstand that kind of heat . Titanium ? Titanium could work . But it would be impossible to identify the entry point from the surface . Right , not to mention that we 're talking about a pretty damn small target here . We can 't just drop this in . No , well , we 'd have to get close . In that kind of heat ? Emily . My God . What happened to you ? I 'm fine . Dylan is still out there . His phone has one of those GPS trackers on it , but my internet 's down . Are you online ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm tweeting live . I 've got the networks on the hook . What 's the number ? You know , if there 's no signal , you 're not going to be able to track it . Sorry . You should do the interview , Em . What ? Well , you know exactly what happened up there . It 's your story . This is a major victory for us , Em . People are trapped out there , Peter . People are dying . That 's-that 's our only priority right now . And I know that . But if we don 't get the truth out there right now , their spin machine is going to smother us . This is their final nail . This is exactly what needed to happen . You were right . Okay , so what if we rig a cable , use a hydraulic winch to maneuver it . No , we 'd be blind . I mean , the only way we can really ensure we 're going to hit that target with any kind of precision is if someone 's right on top of it . But in what ? That heat 's going to be unbearable . The equivalent to what a shuttle goes through on re-entry . Maybe the space program can help us . Wait a minute . You ever heard of the Titan Project ? No . It was originally designed as a manned capsule to be the first Venus lander . They scrapped the project 10 years ago . The technology to make it practical was still too far off , but the capsule itself , that was built . Now , it was sized for one astronaut , and it was built , in fact , to withstand the rigors of re-entry . Now , we might have to piece-meal it , but I think we could probably convert the instrumentation to our needs . Maybe tweak a few of the controls to be able to release the bomb . Wait , wait . Why does someone have to be in it ? Why can 't it be done remotely ? Well , we don 't really have the time to build that kind of technology , and like I said before , you know , the only way to make sure we really hit that target on the nose is if someone 's right on top of it . Otherwise that sonic blast won 't do any good . So , who draws the short straw ? No way . No way , I don 't care how strong that thing is . It 's suicide ... Look , Audrey , if we don 't stop this thing ... No , I don 't care . There 's got to be other options on the table ... There are no other options . This is the table . This is our only option . We 're running out of time , okay ? Harry , if they still have this thing , make a phone call . Let 's get this started . Okay The town of Paxton is reported to be completely cut off , and authorities are trying to break through to evacuate remaining citizens They can confirm that there has been widespread destruction of property and lives from volcanic eruptions in the caldera that surrounds Paxton . You 've reached Emily Booth with All Earth Foundation . Please leave me a message . Make sure you tell those engineers they 're going to have to rig a hell of a counter balance on that crane . They 're already on it . Paul ! Get Reed on the horn ! Tell him the arrival 's going to have to come in from the Northeast . Those choppers won 't get close from any other direction . They 're going to have to coordinate directly with the Corp of Engineers . So , where 's Washington on this ? They 're deferring to us at the moment . They 're briefing the President as we speak . USGS is trying to coordinate with National Guard operations , but they haven 't been able to get through . How long until we get delivery ? They 're still fitting it to our specs . They said by noon tomorrow if they can get the choppers through . Not till noon ? You need to go home and get some sleep . We have a hell of a day tomorrow . There 's a lot of people working round the clock to get this thing ready for you . Sleep . Take him home . Hold on , one sec . One second ... What do we got ? An access point . This should be it . Up here . Are we lost ? This is it , or is this it ? No , should be here , just up here . Yeah , it doesn 't smell right . It 's not right . It 's contaminated . We don 't have much time . Just keep moving . Are you okay ? Yeah . Must be weird to be back here . Doesn 't matter what I think or feel . This is all about Hector . You good ? Yeah , good . Try the other side . Sometimes , you can only get a signal in one tiny little spot . In my bedroom , it 's on the floor , right by the bed . That 's weird ? I wanna go home . I don 't want to be here anymore . I want my morn . I know , it 's okay . So do I. We 're going home really soon , There 's no signal . Sorry . The door was open . - Power 's out . - Yeah . I came to find you . I was trying to track my son down on his cell phone . It 's okay . Anything ? No . I 'm sorry . Is it operable ? You want a drink ? Why don 't you want to talk about it ? Why do I have to talk about it ? Because maybe people care . This way , it 's not real , right ' ? You don 't have to face it . You always think you 're going to have more time , and ... then you realize you won 't . It 's okay to be afraid . It 's okay to be afraid , Matthew . Hey . There we go . - Is that it ? - This is it , this is it . We got it . We 're out . Good work , man . I trusted you . It was a test . Good job , man . What happened ? What 's going on ? He 's bleeding . He 's bleeding ... Okay , come on . What 's happened ? Did you get out ? Oh , God ... Oh , God ... Come here . That 's okay . Keep a hand on it . Help him out , all right ? Ready ? Let 's go ! Okay , let 's go , let 's go . Come on . Come on ... I know he 's out there . I know he 's alive . Well , he has your blood , which means he 's tenacious and unrelenting . He 'll be all right . My grandfather gave me this rock when I was a kid . The very first rock he ever gave me . I want you to give it to Dylan when you see him again . And tell him there 's a story there , that it 's not just some stupid rock , okay ? Okay Hey , earlier , when you broke into my house , you said that you came to see me . Why ? The chances tomorrow aren 't very good , are they ? No . That 's why I came . Let 's go . Keep it up . Keep at it . We 're almost there . Keep going . Sorry . Keep coming . We made it . We made it . We 're actually going to get out of here . - Right , Hector ? - The vent , it 's right over here . The vent 's here . Let 's get him settled down . Yeah , yeah , let 's go , buddy . Just a little further . We 've got to find a way to open this . Okay All right . All right . I 'll take off my belt . All right ... Okay , you 've got to keep breathing . You 've got to keep breathing . Ed , breathe , man ! Breathe , man ! I gotta see this . I gotta unplug the hole . Do you know where we are ? We 're not far from the perimeter of the plant . Which way ? This way . Hey , men ! I 'm going to put some pressure on this . At the count of three . One , two , three . Okay , that 's it . What was that about Montana ? What was that you said ? Think about it . Think about Montana , man . We 're almost there . It 's just down here . We 're almost out of here , buddy . There 's gotta be another way around , right ? The only other access is 10 miles the other way . That 's going to take us all night . Then it takes us all night . Hector ? What 's going on ? Look out ! What 's wrong ? It 's solid steel . It 's all rusted shut . I can 't open it . I wish we had more time . I would have liked that . Me too . Good luck , Dr. Cooper . You , too , Ms. Booth . There 's gotta be another way out of here ? No . That 's the only ventilation shaft that leads into the mines . The rest are all sealed off . What do we do then ? We wait . I can 't ... I can 't hardly ... I can 't breathe . Someone will come . Someone will come . Just stay awake . Stay awake , man . Stay awake . Just got to keep breathing , man . Tango Unit ... Excuse me . I 'm a registered nurse . Thank you . I 'll get you over there . We 're waiting for some supplies , so you 'll have to make do in the meantime . Sergeant ... Has there been any news of any survivors at the well ? Nobody 's been able to get near that area . Go again . Pass me the bag ? Here 's alight . Coming through ! Coming through , please . Hey , excuse me . I 'm looking for a woman named Emily Booth . Sorry , sir ... But you can check with the registrar , just down this way Thanks . Sorry , I don 't want to bother you , I just ... I just wanted to ask how Hector was . I haven 't heard from him . I 'm sorry . I know he did the right thing . He was trying to warn people . So were you . Yeah . I lost something . I know about the bus , and I know the kind of pain you 're in right now . Don 't give up . I haven 't . Emily ! I have a jet waiting . I 'm going to get you out of here . No ... Are-are you kidding me ? - You 're just going to leave ? - I want you safe . Come on . No , look around you . This is all because of you . We didn 't know . Emily , I 'm sorry . We didn 't know . You have been sorry since I was 10 years old ! Emily , listen to me . No , you ... you need to go . - No , listen ... - You need to go right now ! You can hate me , you cannot speak to me for the next 10 years , but I 'm going to get you and Dylan out of here . Dylan is out there . - What ? - He 's out there , and I - I don 't even know if he 's alive ! You did this . You knew it was wrong , and you did anyways . What could be more important than our children ? Tell them . Tell them ! Ms. Preston . He 's waking up . Tommy ? Tommy 's awake . Hey , buddy , how you doing ? Oh , hang on , go slow . Keep your head back for a minute . How are you doing ? Are you dizzy ? Let 's get some water here ... Here , just a sip . Just keep your head back for a minute , okay ? Just give him some air , guys . He 's okay . Ms. Preston , look . These weren 't here before . There must have been a signal . There 's a signal ? - There 's a signal ? - Yes ! There ! Try texting . Sometimes , a text will go through even if a call won 't . - Hey . - Hey . Thanks . My cell ... Oh , my god . It 's Dylan . It 's Dylan . What ? He 's okay . ' Oh , my god . - He 's okay ! Okay . Okay . Sergeant ? Sergeant ? Come on ... Anything ? Tell them we 're at Recreation Park , the south end . Gate D. All right , we 're going to see the same thing topside as you 'll have on your instrument panel , but it 's up to you to guide the operator to the entry point . Now , it is a very narrow target . When the release point has been reached , you 'll see this on your screen . The bomb is on a five-minute delay , and you 're going to need every second of that to get back up past the blast range . You 'd better pull me up quick . There 's one more thing . The Titan was designed for a maximum 15-minute atmospheric re-entry . Every minute past that , and this thing 's going to start coming apart . Yeah . Okay , thank you . It 's ready . Good luck to you . Thanks . Come on , Audrey , I 'm the luckiest geologist in the world right now . I get to go into the bowels of a volcano . Just like going to Disneyland . Not exactly the happiest place on earth . We don 't even know if the hospital 's up and running . We don 't know anything . Hang in there , buddy , okay ? My friend 's hurt . Can you give us a ride back into town ? They 're evacuating . We 're not going back . There 's nowhere to go , man . It 's all blocked that way ! Please . Please ! I 'm sorry . I 've got a family . Please ... Hey . We 'll celebrate when you get back . These prototype tiles are the next generation from those used for the Space Shuttle , but if the heat gets too much , if this tinker toy doesn 't hold up the way we expect it to , don 't be a damn hero . Say the word , we 'll pull you up . Then what ? Exactly . I 'll be up here . Now , we 've gone through this on paper , but real quick ... we 've rigged it so you have rotation control . There 's your thermal monitor . Your depth , your temperature , and your oxygen . Keep your eye on that gauge . Now , if any of these get to the red line , we 've gotta pull you back up , understood ? Yeah . Good luck . Thanks . Okay , Matthew , can you hear us ? Copy Okay , we 're extending the boom now . Copy I 'm ready , Harry . Copy that . Okay , lowering the vehicle . CalTech models are projecting an Extinction Level Event in 30 minutes . Hull integrity index 100 % . Okay , Matthew , we 're 10 meters in . Copy Hull integrity index 96 % . 25 minutes and counting . We 're losing structural fast on this thing . Hull integrity index 78 % . 20 minutes and counting . Matthew ! How you enjoying that sauna ? Funny . I 'm not seeing any breach . O2 levels seem okay . I understand . Very good . I just spoke to our field lieutenant . They 're having a hard time getting into the area . Can 't you just send a helicopter ? No , there is still too much ash . It wouldn 't make it . We 're doing the best we can . Try him again . Guys , try to stay awake . Ava , keep your brother awake , okay ? Okay , Ms. Preston . You guys need help ? I need to get him to a doctor in Paxton . Can you take us ? There 's nowhere to go . Please . He 's gonna die . Let 's go . Let 's go ... We made it , Hank . Almost there . Looks like it 's getting worse . What do you think , Hank ? S-Sorry about Daniels , man . - Wake up . - Yeah . Hey ... Hey , Edward . Edward . Edward . He 's dead , man . - What ? - He 's dead . He 's not ... He 's dead . Come on . Hull integrity index at 58 % . Okay , Matthew , you are passing the halfway mark . Listen , I 'm showing some blistering on the port side . Down to 42 % . It 'll hold . Hull integrity index 39 % . 17 minutes and counting to projected E.L.E. Okay , I have visual on target . What is your position ? I need another five meters ... at 227 degrees . Copy that . Lower , five more meters ! 227 degrees ! Hull integrity index 25 % . 12 minutes and counting . There 's someone here ? They have them . They 're safe , all of them . They 're on their way here . Oh , man . Thank you . Thank you . Just stay down . Just stay down , stay down . Rest . Just take it easy . But don 't sleep . Don 't sleep . Just rest . New activity . We 've got heat indicators all over the map . Matthew , we are down to the wire up here . What is your range to target ' ? Harry , I need another 30 meters . What the hell was that ? Hull integrity index 22 % . Harry , why have we stopped ? Your heat shield is breaking apart . I cannot lower you any closer to that lava . I need another 10 meters . You 're not going to make it 10 more meters . We have to drop right now , while we can at this depth . Harry , it 's not going to work . We need to get closer , or it won 't reach the target . Hull integrity index 19 % . Eight minutes and counting . Harry , just lower it . We 're going to be a giant Roman candle in minutes . Jeez ... Look , we 're wasting time we don 't have , okay ? Lower it . Lower it . Come on , baby , hang in there . Hold on ... Come on , hold on . Six minutes and counting . Okay , give me , give me three meters , 46 degrees . Slowly ... How 's it holding together ? 13 % . Explosives still intact . Hector ! Hector ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Pass me the light . Come on . Okay , I 'm rotating over target . The lava has risen to the next chamber . Hull integrity index 4 % ! Matthew , it has got to happen now . You are out of time . I 'm releasing explosives . Now . Explosives are out . All right , get him out of there ! Get him out of there ! Four minutes and 50 seconds to detonation . Matthew , do you copy ? Three minutes and 30 seconds to detonation . What are his vitals ? We 've lost all contact . Three minutes to detonation . Hector ! Hector ... Hey , hey ! Here . Here . You with me ! Breathe . Breathe ... Just breathe through it . Take it easy , bro . Hey , take it easy . Just breathe . Just breathe ... He 's gone . He 's gone . Anyone else ? - No . - No ? No . Let 's get you out of here ? Okay . Ready to get out of here ? Okay , come on . Put your arm over me . Hey ... Do you want half ' ? Yeah . Thanks . Hull index frozen at 2 % ) . Come on , Doc , are you there ? 25 seconds till detonation . Don 't be playing games with me now . We 're getting a burn at Yellowstone . Another at the Aleutian trench . 15 seconds to detonation . Matthew , do you copy ? Matthew , I repeat , do you copy ? Five seconds . - Commencing detonation . - All right ... hang on , folks ! Levels are still rising . Hull integrity index still frozen at 2 % . Four minutes on the clock . - You okay ? - Yeah . It 's receding . It 's a thing of beauty . All right , Guys Ring of Fire is receding . ' Dad ? - Dylan ? ' Dylan ? - Oh , my God buddy Dylan ? Go to your mom . Mom ! I love you . I love you , too , Mom . Let 's get the doctor to look at you , okay ? Okay Come on . I need some help ! Hey . My friend needs a doctor . He needs help . Okay . Okay , I 'll be right back . Where is he ? Oh , God . Okay . Okay , I 'm going to take you over there No , it 's him . He 's hurt . He 's gone . Okay ? You 've got to let him go . Come on . You did all you could . It 's okay . I 'm so sorry . Matthew , do you copy ? Come on , buddy . Come on , you son of a bitch . It doesn 't look too bad , but let 's get it cleaned out . I need more antiseptic . There 's some in the classroom down the hall . - Could you go get it ? - Okay . I 'll be right back . Okay ? I saw Dylan . He 's okay ? Yeah , considering . I should get back . Emily ... You can 't just walk away this time .

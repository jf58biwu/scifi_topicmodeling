 The secret is out . For decades , your organization stayed in the shadows , hiding the truth . But now we know . They 're among us . Heroes . And monsters . The world is full of wonders . - Thanks , Bernie . - You bet . Ace , come and get it . What do you say we go out to your Aunt Mindy 's this weekend ? You and Keisha can swim in the pond . Sure . You know , you got a birthday coming up in a couple of months . Who 's your favorite ? I 'm okay . Hey . Things are tight right now , but I 'm gonna find something . Not back at the factory , but I got prospects . - You and me , what are we ? - We 're a team . That 's right . So , who do you ... Are you okay ? All right , Ace , look at me . I need you to stay here with Bernie . Okay , people might be hurt , and I 'm gonna see if they need my help . Stay with Bernie . Watch my boy ! Help me ! Help me ! Help me ! Help me ! We can 't explain everything we see , but our eyes are open . So what now ? There are no more shadows for you to hide in . Something impossible just happened . What are you going to do about it ? Agent Ward , there 's been a development . It 's the Rising Tide . They 've pinned down the location of the package . We need to abort . I 'm five minutes away from retrieving it . So is everyone else . They posted the coordinates online . If the job was easy ... Yeah , it wouldn 't be any fun . Watch your 6 . Red tie , by the window . Your fireplace is broken . Ward , just a heads up . We 've got possible hostiles in your vicinity . Really ? What does S.H.I.E.L.D. stand for , Agent Ward ? Strategic Homeland Intervention , Enforcement and Logistics Division . And what does that mean to you ? It means someone really wanted our initials to spell out " shield . " it means we 're the line between the world and the much weirder world . We protect people from news they aren 't ready to hear . And when we can 't do that , we keep them safe . Something turns up , like this Chitauri neural link , we get to it before someone bad does . Any idea who Vanchat was planning to sell it to ? I 'm more interested in how this Rising Tide group found out about it . I thought they were just hackers . What changed ? Everything 's changing . A little while ago , most people went to bed thinking that the craziest thing in the world was a billionaire in a flying metal suit . Then aliens invaded New York and were beaten back by , among others , a giant green monster , a costumed hero from the ' 40s , and a god . I don 't think Thor is technically a god . Well , you haven 't been near his arms . The Battle of New York was the end of the world . This , now , is the new world . People are different . They have access to tech , to formulas , secrets they 're not ready for . Why was I pulled out of Paris ? That you 'Il have to ask Agent Coulson . Yeah. I 'm clearance Level 6 . I know that Agent Coulson was killed in action before the Battle of New York . Got the full report . Welcome to Level 7 . Sorry , that corner was really dark and I couldn 't help myself . I think there 's a bulb out . Director Fury faked your death , to motivate the Avengers . Well , the death of a common ally is a particularly effective team builder . Say " cheese . " Plus , it wasn 't that much of a stretch . I stopped breathing for about 40 seconds . Eight . It gets longer every time you tell it . Yeah , well , you get shanked by the Asgardian Mussolini , you can tell it your way . I was looking at the big white light , and it felt like a lot longer than eight seconds . Do they know ? The Avengers ? That Fury played them ? They 're not Level 7 . Got out of the ICU , Fury stuck me in a grass shack in Tahiti . Rough gig . Mai Tais , Travis McGee novels , and a physical therapist whose command of English was irrelevant . But something put you back in the game . What is that ? That 's a superhero , Agent Ward . An unregistered Gifted . Identity unknown . The secret 's out . For decades , your organization ... Another little present from the Rising Tide . How are they getting this stuff before us ? Same way they cracked our RSA implementation . They 're good . So I need better . Agent Coulson has requisitioned a mobile command unit , to which you are assigned . Rising Tide is trying to draw us out . I think it 's time they succeeded . You want me to cross them off ? Wow . No . I wanna use them to get to him . This man 's world is about to get very weird . He 's gonna need some help . I 'm sorry. I was trained from day one as a specialist . I go in alone , I get it done . Defusing a nuclear bomb , I 'm your guy . A welcoming committee ? Not my speed . I know it 's not what you want . Agent Hill did a very detailed assessment of your last three missions . Combat , top grades . Espionage , she gave you the highest marks since Romanoff . Under " people skills , " she drew a ... I think it 's a little poop with knives sticking out of it . - What ? - It ... That 's bad , right ? And given your family history , I 'm surprised it 's not worse . But I think you 're the guy for this . If I 'm wrong , you go straight back to your bombs . Team 's approved . Physicals are all fine . Fitz-Simmons is not cleared for combat . I 'm told that won 't be an issue . Agent Ward here , he 's almost too fit . That 's an issue . That should be an issue . Maybe I can 't join the team because ... God , are you dismissed . It was a porcupine . It was not a poop . It just means that you need ... No , I 'm pretty sure . And it 's not just Ward . Your whole roster is sketchy . Well , they 're cleared . I would 've been very happy not to clear you , Phil . I 'd love for you to rest up some more . I 've had plenty of that , thanks . You sure ? You should go sometime . Where ? Tahiti . It 's a magical place . Three days in , I 'd be begging for an assignment . Exactly . Tahiti . He really doesn 't know , does he ? He can never know . Is there any way I can thank him ? Are you sure nobody saw him ? So , the identity of the Hooded Hero still remains unknown . Researchers at UCLA Medical Center released a study today , which shows ... - Just act natural . - What ? Just pretend that we 're talking . - We are . - Good . 'Cause you never know who 's listening . I don 't even know who 's talking . I 'm Skye . And you 're the Hooded Hero . Please tell me that you 're not staying with that name . Wait , what ? I 'm not ... I 'm a factory worker . Sure , by day. I saw you . You 're a hero . Like , a for real superhero , which is ... I 'm not like a groupie-stalker type , but ... Oh , my God ! That is so cool ! Okay , okay , chill . Just don 't ... Don 't draw attention . You 're in danger . You got the wrong guy , lady . No , you 've got the wrong approach . The cute girl from the hospital is dying to thank you , and possibly " thank " you , and you 're hiding ! The clip of you rescuing her has had the most hits since that puppy with vertigo , and you can 't even find a job . What do you mean about danger ? S.H.l.E.L.D. " Shield " what ? I should carry a shield ? S.H.l.E.L.D. Government . Scary men in dark suits who come after guys like you . They knew about the Battle of New York before it even happened . And then cleaned it up before anyone could ask any real questions . Overnight . How long do you think it 'Il take for them to clean you up ? And you wanna know why I 'm hiding ? What if you didn 't hide ? What if you got in front of this and let people know that you 're a hero ? I 'm just a guy . Well , a guy like that gets work , gets perks . I can help. I 'm great with computers . Like , weirdly great . I mean , I could help you create a whole new identity , or ... A mask ! Okay ! Also , we could just stick with the hood . Listen . You cannot walk away from this . With great power comes a ton of weird crap that you are not prepared to deal with . Now , my office is ... You have an office ? Yes , I have an office . It 's a mobile office . It 's a van. I live in a van . By choice ! But it 's always in the alley around the corner , free Wi-Fi , and you can come by any time . Thank you . They 're coming for you Mike . Agent May . No . So you 've been briefed ? I 'm not going back in the field . Yeah , you 've got such a nice set-up here . You ever thought about adding a moat ? I just need you to drive the bus . Liaise ground transpo , some on-site supervision . This isn 't a combat op . Then you don 't need me . I do . 'Cause we 'Il be running ourselves . Picking the ops , making the calls . No red tape . This is where they actually make the red tape , isn 't it ? I always wondered . Melinda . You 're really just asking me to drive the bus ? I 'm not asking . But it 's a really nice bus . Whoa , whoa , whoa , watch it ! That 's the Night-Night Gun ! Well , it 's on my stuff and it doesn 't work , and there 's no way we 're calling it the " Night-Night Gun . " The bullets work . Non-lethal , heavy stopping power , break up under the subcutaneous tissue . Yeah , with a dose of only 0.1 microliters of dendrotoxin . I 'm not Hermione , I can 't create instant paralysis with that . - You should 've run the specs by me ... - The bullets are hollow . - ... before building the molds . - It 's a marvel I can keep them from breaking apart in the chamber . Have you ever heard of physics ? Or what 's the other one ? Inertia ? Fitz-Simmons ? - Fitz . - Simmons . I 'm Engineering , she 's Bio-chem . Agent Ward ? Coulson said I 'd need my comm receiver encoded . I don 't know if you 've worked with that model before . It 's brand new . He 'Il repurpose the l.D.l.S. chip . Don 't need the external receiver for the inner ear comms anymore . So , how does it ... Embedded sensory-neural silicone matched to your DNA . It 's very posh . So , are you excited to be coming on our journey into mystery ? It 's like Christmas . One of Coulson 's old S.H.l.E.L.D. collectibles . Flame-throwers , world 's first GPS . He 's mad for this crap . Don 't touch Lola . And he calls it a girl 's name . Lola 's not just a collectible , you know ? People tend to confuse the words " new " and " improved . " This mobile command , they were in heavy rotation back in the ' 90s , but then we got a Helicarrier . Hey , did you hear the one about the guy who 's afraid of flying ? I 've done a nightjump into a drop zone under heavy fire , sir. I can handle it . That was a joke . The first part of a ... I 'm not gonna tell it now . If you plan to unpack , make it quick . Wheels are up in five . We may have a hit on one of the Rising Tide 's routing points . Good . We need to do some catching up . Is that who I think it is ? She 's just the pilot . Melinda May is just the pilot . Come on , sir . What game are you really playing ? Better stow your gear . How will you come at us ? From the air ? From the ground ? How will you silence us this time ? How can you ? The truth is in the wind . It 's everywhere . You cannot stop the Rising Tide . You will not find us . You will never see our faces , but rest assured , we will rise against those who shield us from the truth . And nothing , nothing , can stop us in the ... Hey . What up ? You guys are making a big mistake . You don 't look that big . Sorry for the lack of finesse . Agent Ward here has had a little history with your group , the Rising Tide . I don 't know what you ... Okay . There are two ways we can do this . Oh . Is one of them the easy way ? No . Oh . What 's your name ? Skye . What 's your real name ? That can wait . It 's another name we need . A certain hero . What makes you think I know that ? Well , you made a little mistake . The phone you filmed the Hooded Hero with had the same cryptographic signature as a few of the Rising Tide posts . Wow , yeah . Was that a mistake ? Or am I now sitting in the center of your secret headquarters ? What is this ? A plane ? I got inside . And by now you 've discovered you can 't beat the encryption on my equipment , so you got nothing . We have a fairly strong coincidence . You being on the scene right before it went up in flames . Wanna tell me what my team is gonna find there ? How did you know the hooded man was in the building ? Did you blow it up to draw him out ? Did you ? That 's not our style . I was just kidnapped by your style . S.H.I.E.L.D. covered up New Mexico , Project Pegasus . Of course you 'd be covering up Centipede . Centipede ? Holy no way . You don 't know what that is . Billions of dollars of equipment at your disposal , and I beat you with a laptop that I won in a bet ? You need to think about your friend . We 're not the only ones interested in people with powers . We 'd like to contain him , yeah . The next guy will wanna exploit him , and the guy after that will wanna dissect him . What is Centipede ? Yeah , I get it , but ... Listen , Doctor , people saw me . They saw what I can do . If I went public , that might be good . I mean , your product works . It works amazingly , and ... Yeah , yeah , I know what I signed , but if we got out in front of this , maybe ... Then what ? You want me to go crawling back to the factory ? I couldn 't even get workman 's comp from those crooks. I don 't think ... Yeah ... Doctor , I just thought ... Okay . This was a lab . Was this leased as a lab ? Self-empowerment center . With a top-of-the-line motion sensor security system . Ah . So a secret lab ? And a superhero . Not a coincidence . So was this explosion sabotage ? Was it meant for him ? Or are they just in over their heads ? Yep . Working the problem . Ladies , if you 'Il just ... Sorry . If you 're gonna be in the field , Agent Fitz , you have to get your hands dirty . No , I don 't . Heigh-ho . Off to work you go . Centipede . It was chatter on the web , and then , gone . I traced the access point MAC address to that building . What were you after ? The truth . What are you after ? World peace . You pseudo-anarchist hacker types love to stir things up , but you 're never around for the fallout . People keep secrets for a reason , Skye . Well , just because you 're reasonable and firm doesn 't mean that you 're not a evil faceless government tool bag . Just give us your guy 's name . He 's not my guy ! You understand he 's in danger . Then let me go ! Let me talk to him . Me , not the T-1000 here . You wanna be alone with him . Of course . She 's a groupie . All this hacking into S.H.l.E.L.D. , tracking powers , she might as well be one of those sweaty cosplay girls crowding around Stark Tower . What ? I would ... It was one time . Ward . Is it the girl ? She getting under your skin ? Sir ? Or is it the assignment ? Are you so anxious to get out of this that you 'd deliberately blow an interrogation ? Give me a minute alone with her , you 'Il have your answers . She 's an asset . She is such an ... Wait , asset ? We don 't know anything about her . Do you appreciate how often that happens ? That never happens . We need what she knows . See , we designed each with their own capabilities , so some recording the dimensions and textures of the room , and then some testing the matter density , radiation . I mean , one is basically just smelling . Whoa , whoa , whoa . I 've got something in something . Who 's got it ? Bashful . Aw . Surveillance camera . Deep-fried . Yes , but that model has flash memory in case of brownouts . Now , I could sync that with data from the motion detectors , and , with a little luck , get some images from before the blast . And by " luck " l mean " unappreciated genius . " Yeah , we 'Il need it . Snow 's reading some compounds that are ... Oh , my God . Explosive ? Not of this Earth . This is QNB-T-16 . It 's the top-shelf martini of sodium pentothal derivatives . It 's a brand new and extremely potent truth drug . Don 't worry , the effects only last about an hour . And you 'Il have a nice little nap , and we 'Il have all the answers to our ... Hey ! What the hell ! I 'm sorry , did that hurt ? No . But you 've lost your mind . You should never do that to a member of your team . And yes , it did hurt a little bit . But I always try and mask my pain in front of beautiful women because I think it makes me seem more masculine . My God , this stuff works fast . Don 't trust us ? Ask him whatever you 'd like . Wait a minute . Wait , you can 't just ... This is definitely not protocol ! You seem nervous , Agent Ward . I 'm calling to mind my training . There 's no way I 'm gonna reveal classified secrets to a girl who 's hell-bent on taking us down . Have you ever killed anyone ? Yes , a few . High-risk targets . But they were terrible people who were trying to murder nice people . And I didn 't feel good afterwards . And does your grandmother know about these things ? Gramzy ? My hands are tied , Mike . It 's company policy . You didn 't meet quota , I had to let you go . Gary , look , I got no choice . It 's just me and my boy now . There 's no openings , Mike . And even if there were , I got 100 guys standing in line that are just like you , only they won 't bitch when their back hurts . I was injured , but I 'm stronger now . I can handle twice the load I used to . What are you not hearing ? You don 't cut it . When I say I need things moved , I need ... Like that ? Are you out of your mind ? These are people , Gary . Men . Not parts you replace when they break . It 's not me , man . It 's the company . I 'm not the bad guy . I 'm not the bad guy , man . Yes , you are . It 's simple now . Just like we used to read about . You 're the bad guy . And I 'm the hero . Did Agent Ward give you anything ? He told me he 's been to Paris , but he 's never really seen it and that he wishes you had stayed in Tahiti . It 's a magical place . Ward doesn 't like your style . I kind of think I do . What about his ? ... remains in critical condition . Employees could not identify the attacker , but security footage confirms that this man assaulted the factory foreman before damaging thousands of dollars worth of company property ... This is wrong . This is not the guy I met . He was ... He just needs a break . Then give him one . What have you got ? Michael Peterson . Factory worker , married , one kid . Gets injured , gets laid off , wife jumps ship . Good guy , bad breaks . Best guess is , somebody tells him they can make him strong again . Make him super . Who has the tech to do that ? And why would they want to ? Fitz , what do we have from the security footage ? Before the blast . What are we seeing ? Well , the man is angry at the other man . The data is very corrupt . - Yeah , like Cold War Russia corrupt . - Yeah . I can 't sync the time code without ... What if you had the audio ? I was running surveillance on the lab . I had my shotgun mic pointed at the window before the blast . The digital file 's in my van . There 's too much background noise for me , but you could probably ... You can clean that up , can 't you ? Find a sync point and use cross-filed validation to find ... But I can 't scrub for expression patterns when the VITC is all ... Well , is there a chrominance subcarrier ? Yeah , attached to the back porch . Brilliant . - That audio would be great . - We will take that audio , please . Thank you very , very much . Your van 's here . But you were right . We couldn 't decrypt the files . The encryption 's coupled to the GPS . Get my van back to that alley , and then I 'm in business . Agent May will escort you . And on your way out , wake up Ward . You 're ... Wow , you 're him . I 'm glad you 're doing okay . Yeah . Thank you . They 're beautiful . What the hell are you doing here ? I don 't know where to go , Doctor . Everything 's getting ... I know what 's right , I do . But no one will listen to me . I volunteered because you said things would change . You said you could keep it together . Our first subject lost it , walked into the lab with a freaking bomb ... I 'm not like him . Well , tell that to your foreman in the ICU . I saved you ! You exposed me ! You exposed the program . The people who gave me this technology , they are very serious and they do not want to be revealed . Mike Peterson needs to disappear . You 're right . I 'm not him anymore . I 'm someone else now . Please . You 're juiced , Mike ! And you 're losing it just like the last guy . God , this is a disaster . No . It 's an origin story . Audio file should be coming through . It 's not compressed , so it might take a minute . Yeah . Yeah , yeah , I 'm getting it . So , when you get back , I 'Il show you my thing . A thing . It 's not ... It 's my hardware . My equipment ! Let 's hang up . So the alien metal wasn 't the explosive ? Well , I assumed from the break pattern and dispersion that it was . But it 's just dripping with gamma radiation and ... Ugh ! Now it 's actually dripping . Fun ! So what did that get us ? Skye 's sending us the rest of her decrypted files on Centipede , but we have her audio. I 've loaded it up . Nice work . Using motion estimation , Bayesian inference , a beam splitter and a little diffraction theory , our mystery man appears . It 's like magic , but it 's science . Explosives in the case ? Please , calm down . Just , let me check your vitals . I feel fine. I want to feel more . Where 's the doctor ? Where is she ? If you don 't settle down , I 'Il have you sedated . Where is she ? Wait , did you see that on his arm ? What does that look like to you ? A centipede . It 's an intravenous filter for his blood . This goo , sir ? Very similar to the serum Dr. Erskine developed in the ' 40s for the ... Super-soldiers . I 'm reading alien metal , gamma radiation , the serum . Every known source of superpower , thrown in a blender . We need to see the origin of the blast . Run it back from the last point recorded . That should do it . Let 's head back . All right . Let me just ... Mike ! What are you doing ? Saving you . From the scary men in dark suits . And you 're gonna help save us . " Us " ? Don 't cry , okay ? Stay strong for me , Ace . What are we ? We 're a team . That 's right . Now drive ! EXTREMIS . It 's new . Completely unstable . Poor man didn 't bring an explosive . And Mike has the same stuff in his system . Well , judging by his strength level , a lot more . So any minute now , Mike is gonna ... He 'Il take out anyone within a two-block radius . Well , you wanted a bomb . Sir ? He didn 't explode because he was angry . The two are connected . Well , it 's kind of a chemical surge , but calming him down will buy him a minute at most . He will detonate within the next few hours . Solution ? Isolate him ? Get him away from people ? Or ? Put a bullet through his brain . If he 's dead , this irradiated metabolic process will stop . You need to come up with a third option . One that doesn 't involve Mike 's son losing a father . We have a couple of hours at most . There 's no way that we could possibly ... Don 't ever tell me there 's no way ! It 's on you . Get it done . May . He took Skye . You 're all right ? We 'Il deal with that later . At length . Right now we need to figure out where they went . How long is this gonna take ? This is top speed , trust me . It 's not like I 'm deleting a Facebook page . I 'm bypassing the License Bureau 's AES protected data stream . So , chill . How do I know you can really do this ? I 've done it before . Come on , give me more paralysis , less rigor mortis ! Come on ! No , no , no . Just pretend it 's an exam . We 're taking an exam . - An exam ? Yeah . - Yeah . Okay. I don 't want an " F " equals a massacre . Whoa ! Oh , no ! What is this nonsense ? Why are you making nonsense ? This isn 't me ! It 's noise . Someone 's hacking our secure channel . It 's longitude and latitude . Mike took Skye . She 's telling us where . We 'Il take the nice lady with us . We can 't go to the airport , so we 'Il take a train . And there , she 'Il help us start over . Make a new life . A better life . Like I always said . Look at this place . You 're gonna risk thousands of lives over some nobody ? Nobody 's nobody , Ward . Fitz-Simmons will come through . Mr. Peterson , good morning . We 're not a threat , we 're here to help . But you 're in danger and we need to take you in . What did you do ? You 're right , he is a little bitch ! - Go on , get her ! Get her ! - Ace , get back . Man , get out the way , man ! Come on ! Come on , now . Ace ! Tell dispatch we need backup ! Hey . Let 's get him out of here . Help my daddy . - l promise . - Come on , honey . Ace ! Ace ! Look . The stuff inside you is unstable . It 'Il kill you and everyone in here . Who 's gonna miss us ? We 're at the north entrance , May . We told them to hold fire . I don 't think that 's us . We may have a third party here . He 's gonna head down to the tracks . You stay high , I 'Il go low . Only take the shot if you have to , Ward . Ward ! If I have to . You 've got to stop . These people can help you . The men in suits ? They 're your buddies , now ? Where 'd they take my son ? Get down ! You think that means anything ? I know you got men everywhere waiting to put me down . I know how this plays out . I don 't . I know you got poison in your system . I know it 's burning you up . Mike , the last guy who wore that exploded . I 'm not like that other guy. I 'm ... It matters who I am , inside , if I 'm a good person , if I 'm strong . I have a clear shot . Do you copy ? I know you 're strong . Your boy knows it . He needs you to let us help . You took him ! You took my wife , my job , my house . You think this is killing me ? All over , there 's people being pushed down , being robbed . One of them tries to stand up , you got to make an example out of him . You bring this building down on us , will that help them ? That 's a lie ! All you do is lie ! You said if we worked hard , if We did right , we 'd have a place . You said it was enough to be a man . But there 's better than man . There 's gods . And the rest of us , what are we ? They 're giants . We 're what they step on . I know . I 've seen giants up close . And that privilege cost me . Nearly everything . But the good ones , the real deal ? They 're not heroes because of what they have that we don 't . It 's what they do with it . You 're right , Mike . It matters who you are . I could , you know ? Be a hero . I 'm counting on it . Subject is in stable condition . All clear at Union Station . I told him his father was coming home . He will . We have some experience with this . He almost blew . We almost died . We have some experience with that , too . You don 't have it all mapped out . True . We didn 't cut off the head of the Centipede . Whoever sponsored that little experiment is still out there . Among other things . It 's a brave new world , and a really old car . Lola can keep up . What about you ? Have you thought about the offer ? Hitching a ride on the crazy plane ? Not exactly a team player . We 're not exactly a team . But we 're in a position to do some good . You 'd be a great help . And you 'd be front row center at the strangest show on Earth , which is , after all , what you wanted . I was able to hack S.H.I.E.L.D. from my van . Are you gonna show me something new ? Go . Sir ? We 've got an 084 . Is that confirmed ? They want us to go in and confirm it . What 's an 084 ? You 've got exactly 10 minutes to decide if you really wanna know . There 's no way we can make it to the airfield in 10 minutes . The tide is rising .

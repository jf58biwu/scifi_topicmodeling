 Previously on Caprica ... No ! Ben ! A group known as Soldiers of the One is responsible for the bombing . We don 't really know the people closest to us . My daughter died in the bombing of train number 23 . But I think she may have caused it . My daughter was a terrorist ! I 'm just trying to find out who I am . I 'm Zoe , and the avatar , and the robot . Like some kind of ... What you call it ? Three-parter . Trinity . That 's what you are . I 've been given a mission that will change my life . I have someone for you to find . Keon Gatwick . I need to know I can count on you to get me to Gemenon . I made a promise to Zoe before she died . I need to get something to Gemenon . I 'll see what I can do . Everything I 've built is on the line . People are so angry , they are throwing away their Graystone computers . Sarno 's making public opinion , and everyone in the Twelve Worlds is watching . Have Priyah book me on Sarno . Blood for blood . It 's the Tauron way . Daniel Graystone lost his daughter , right ? I lost my daughter and my wife . Balance it out . What 's going on ? Bomb in a Holocafe three hours ago . Place was closed and empty . Okay , so not out to kill . Threat ? Or warning or nuisance or personal beef with the owner . Or STO . What ? You don 't come back after 10 years just to blow up a train . No , they want us scared . Small bomb , middle of the night . My money 's on copycats . Yeah . Well , if you 've got no STO worries , maybe you don 't want to hear about what I picked up at the courthouse . Don 't be coy . I hate that . What you got ? Inter-colonial court on Libran handed that down an hour ago . Last matter of the day . Themis standard time . Search warrant for a private school ? How did you get this ? When Amanda Graystone held up that little infinity pendant at the memorial service , she handed us grounds to search Zoe 's property , which includes the contents of her locker at school and any other locker she might have used . So you 're going to call in the press , make a thing of it ? I might . Keep it tasteful . Good morning . Hmm . Am I too sweaty for you ? Mmm-mmm . Is that your phone ? Clarice Willow . Get off me . Get off me right now . Clarice , what 's going on ? I 'm so sorry . It 's my fault entirely . Global Defense Department ! Listen carefully , everybody ! I need you to step away from the lockers right now . Everyone ! Now ! Step away ! Clear the hallway ! Let 's go ! Ladies . That 's it . Move . Move out . Come on , folks ! That 's it . Toss everything . That 's it . Toss them all . Keon . Keon , we need to talk . I 'll walk away . You follow in a few . Next one . Next one . This is clear . This is a script . It 's a list of talking points . " I loved my daughter very much . " We only have a couple of hours . " I knew she was troubled . There were disturbing signs " well before I developed the Holoband technology . " All it needs are stage directions . Should I point to my heart ? Daniel , please . Look , we 're not telling you how to say it . Just what to say . Use your own phrasing . Well , I don 't want to say she was troubled . It 's important . Why ? If she had a pre-existing problem , it takes the onus off the Holoband . Well , then I 'll find a different way of saying it . She 's not happy I 'm going on Sarno . Exactly how not happy ? Not happy enough to make another announcement ? No . If she contradicts you ... She 'll be fine . You should probably play it a little guilty . You missed the warning signs . You 'll always blame yourself a little bit because of that . People want contrition . Just make it clear it 's not guilt for making a dangerous product . No . What happened to Zoe ... It had nothing to do with the Holoband . Well , that 's just true . That was great . Do that . I 'm a star . Can you say it all from the beginning again ? Yeah ? Why isn 't it done ? Because , sofistace , they 're both in the house and there 's two other people in there . How big a blood bath do you want ? Right . No . Gods . No blood bath . It 's ... You still want to do this , right ? Yes . Of course . Then have patience , Yoseef . I know it 's all been very , very upsetting . And I 'm going to make sure it doesn 't happen again . Now , everybody , just go home . I 'll see you tomorrow . Go on . Are they gone ? Yeah , they went ahead to the studio . I need to get dressed . Do you know where the coat to this is ? I have no idea . It 's going to strobe , anyway . Yeah , you 're probably right . I just can 't believe you 're going out there to dance on her grave like this . I 'm just saying the exact same thing that you said . I didn 't say she was crazy . She blew up a train . Maybe . You know , I don 't even know what she did . Maybe she was just running away . Think I want to do this ? I don 't want to do this , but I have to , because you opened up this little dialogue with Greater Caprica . I didn 't mean to go on television . You are deliberately going on television . There were cameras all over that park . I was just talking to the crowd . Now , we just have to go with it . All right ? Does this tie work ? Yeah . It 's great . Okay . Look , can 't you just go out there and say that this is a very sad time for our family and that we need time to process ? No , that just doesn 't play . The car should be here by now . Serge ? Doesn 't play ? It doesn 't play ? No . Did you actually hear what you just said ? It won 't play ? I don 't have time for this right now . You sound like Cyrus . I 'm about to go on international television . It won 't play ? We are not company spokespeople . We 're parents ! Parents ? Actually , no , we 're not . Can I help you , Daniel ? No . Oh , hell . Oh , hello , beautiful . How are you doing ? Me ? I 'm doing great . Thanks for asking . Well ... So , yeah , they leave you down here all alone . Yeah , yeah . Let 's take a closer look . Do you know , that is the finest work that I have ever done , designing that ? Mmm-hmm . You need a name . I want to go through it again . Yeah , let 's run it . Get comfortable . One more time . I still see the bruises . I 'm doing my best . She was complicated . Long before I invented the Holoband ... " Troubled " is better than " complicated . " " Complicated " is meaningless . I shouldn 't have to say it in one word anyway . It 's ridiculous . Zoe was ... Zoe 's troubles started a long time ago . How 's that ? " Zoe 's troubles " ? No , it 's not the same . " I loved Zoe . " What ? Yeah , it 's a good place for you to start . " I loved Zoe , and I wish I had seen the signs , but it wasn 't the Holoband . " " She was troubled . " Give me a cigarette , Cyrus . You can 't smoke while I 'm working . Oh . Rebecca , I am so sorry . I did not mean to offend you , but the idea of going on live television , quite frankly , makes me want to vomit . Is there anything I can do to help change your mind ? No . I 'll give you 1,000 cubits if you let me have a cigarette . Done . Thank you . Where were you ? You weren 't at school . They called . I was with Uncle Sam . It 's not a problem , is it ? I guess not . I won 't tell your father . On Tauron , when you 're 13 , you 're a man . You make your own decisions . Okay . Thank you , Tsattie . He barely sees you . He shouldn 't be angry when he does . What do you want to be , William ? I don 't know , yet . I haven 't really thought about it . No , no . Not when you grow up . What do you want to be now ? Well , there was this job for kids , where you work inside the locker rooms with the Pyramid players . Okay . Be that . It 's just that Dad knows the owner . Mr. Graystone ? I 'm not sure if they 're still friends . I 'm not sure if he still likes him . You think you only get things from friends ? You get the best things from enemies . Because they 're scared of you . Sam can look into it , okay ? Your uncle knows how to make things happen . Yoseef . Sam ? You 're the one who sent me to do this , you know ? You 're going to have to be able to live with it . Just get it done . Well , keep your pants on . I 'm going in now . Wait a minute . What ? Wait ? Sam . Sam . GDD . What ? Global agents . Okay . My guys inside . Just give me a second . Everybody in ? Press , you 've got to stay outside . You can 't do this here . Warrant . My husband does defense work on these premises . The girl 's room is downstairs . Everybody wears gloves . Okay . The warrant only applies to the residence . We 're not gonna go anywhere near your husband 's lab , okay ? If you 're going to do this to her , I want to see this . I want to see this . Doctor . Doctor , please . Stay calm for a second . We 're not going to do anything to her . We 're just trying to find out who turned her into a bomber . Please . Not her cello . She 's ... At least please tell them to be careful with it . Careful with the cello . Do you really have to do this ? Really ? I mean , what do you think you 're going to find here ? I really don 't know . Maybe who she met with , who brainwashed her into believing in a moral dictator called God . Maybe the name of some other kid who blew up a Caprican business in the middle of the night . I really don 't know . Do you honestly think that information is here ? Really ? Jordan . In the jewelry box . That wasn 't ... I put that there . That wasn 't here . There are loose ends , Doctor . And I 'm sorry if we have to take your daughter 's life apart in order to put other terrorists behind bars . But if we have to , then so be it . What is this to you ? Did you lose someone on that train ? I lost everyone on that train . And I 'll see you later . Keon . What are you doing here ? Last time I saw you , I had you pinned to the ground . You said you 'd help me get to Gemenon . Well , I was wrong . I can 't . You shouldn 't have scampered off during the locker search . It made you look guilty . You should go . I 'm the only one here today , and I have to have this bucket case fixed by the end of the afternoon . So ... What are you doing ? My mom does repairs , like , for a living . Well , what if someone sees us together ? Who 's seeing ? Nothing in Zoe Graystone 's room ? No . The parents cleaned out the room . Look at the school . Yeah . Nothing there , either . Minor drug stuff . You guaranteed me detonators and infinity symbols . Sir , it is too clean . Look , somebody got to those kids . Please . Give me the power to access communications to the students . E-sheets . Phones . Gee , Scout Leader Duram . The slope 's getting kind of slippery . Ben Stark and Zoe Graystone , I guarantee you they are not the only students the STO turned at that school . Now , we find out who it was who warned those kids , we find out who it was who 's running the operation . You 're wrong about this , I own your or-kyahs . Tauron slang . It 's very street of you , sir . Fine . If I 'm wrong , I 'll serve them to you on a plate . There . Well , that 's a nice looking chest . I think it looks great . So let 's check you out , shall we ? See that we didn 't glitch any connections . Running diagnostic test . Look at you . I 'm going to make you dance . All right ? Okay . Here , here . Try this . Try this . Diagnostic test complete . Last of the e-sheets for today . Now , if we had an up-to-date computer ... All right . Check around 6 : 00 a.m. It 's most likely a group-send to the entire student body . I 've never seen you like this . Yeah ? Well , we had Ben Stark and we let him go . Look , I 'm sorry . I 'm not putting this all on you . We all got complacent . We 're all responsible . Really ? So are we all responsible for the bad wheat crop on Aerilon ? Well , why are you doing it ? You 're still here . You 're working as hard as I am . It looks to me like Gemenese scum are luring good Caprican kids into a killer cult . Anyone doing that needs to be destroyed . Yeah . I got something for Willie . They 're like jacks . Since you threw out his fancy games . What are these ? Bones ? Tauron children play jacks with the finger bones of the Tauron children who lose at jacks . That was a joke . They 're bones from chicken feet . The interview you thought you 'd never see . Daniel Graystone , coming up at 10 : 00 on Backtalk with Baxter Sarno . That 's the man you don 't like . Yeah . Well . It 's going to be taken care of . Good . No , the dead don 't really die until their death is avenged . My daughter and your daughter are caught between life and death . He 's going to pay . Good . Believe me . Hey , guys . Okay ! Welcome to Backtalk . Thank you guys so much for coming out . We have got a pretty amazing show . I don 't need to tell you why . So let 's get through this horrible monologue that I wrote two minutes ago . Not that things are perfect here on Caprica . Some of you know that the residents are not too happy with the government right now , saying they are soft on terrorism . They 're saying thirty seconds . Let 's go . Okay . So , in order to protest ... I see you guys laughing over there . I 'm sure you 're involved in this . Okay , here we go . Daniel , they 're about to introduce you . Okay . I just ... I need a second . Oh , my Gods ! They broke our back . They sent us peppermint stick . There 's nothing we can do . Finally , some of you may have heard , yesterday , security was called in here , but there 's nothing to worry about now . It turns out it was a huge misunderstanding . I was only bombing figuratively . Figuratively . Wow . Yes . Fire half of the writing staff . Okay . On that grim note , let 's bring out our first guest . Needs no introduction . Ladies and gentlemen , please welcome Daniel Graystone . Oh , yes . There he is . Cyrus , the Global Defense just came to the house . They ransacked the place . They 're doing this wrong . Daniel , there are things he has to say . Amanda . You see ... Can we talk about this later ? It 's too late . He 's on . Thank you for coming on . I think I may have mentioned you a couple of times this week . I don 't know if ... Yeah ? Yes , you did . My solstice wish was for free publicity . I probably should have been a little more specific . I feel so much better about my monologue right now . All right , that 's ... I 'm sorry . Listen . This is what 's going on . Is this water ? That ... Indeed , it 's water . Were you expecting ... Was there something else in your rider that you needed ? No , I 'm fine with water . Can we get something stronger for Mr. Graystone ? We 're good ? I 'm fine . Thank you . Okay . Um ... Your wife has stated that your daughter , Zoe Graystone , was involved with terrorists and may have been ... We don 't know ... May have been responsible ... ... anything for sure . ... for the bombing . But , yes . It does seem that she had fallen in with this group , the Soldiers of the One . She was ... She was ... She was troubled . Hey . Let me tell you ... This started a long time before I invented the Holoband . Let me tell you what I see . Troubled ? Okay ? Let me tell you what I see here . I see a lot of young people growing up in a virtual world now . Yes . I 've actually heard your theory about this . I 've heard it before . If I may ... Okay . Let 's not talk theories , then . Let 's talk facts . All right . Facts . Your daughter , your troubled daughter , growing up with Holobands and learning that there are no consequences , absolutely . You see ? But ... He was right . It 's not a good word . It 's not a good word . You know it 's not a good word . But , you see , the thing is , she didn 't even like the Holoband . She didn 't like the Holoband ? Not at all . Hated it . Yes . Maybe because it was making her want to blow things up ? You know ? And the whole ... No . Amanda . Wait . No , no , no , no , no . Ladies and gentlemen , please welcome Dr. Amanda Graystone . Dr. Amanda Graystone . Wow . People watching at home , let 's hit " record . " And we 'll be right back after these messages . This is going to be very exciting . So stick around . Okay . We are back . Dr. Graystone , this is a shock and a surprise . Yes . It 's a surprise for me , too . But ... I couldn 't stand there . I just had to . I ... You 're both getting this wrong . I 'm getting this wrong . Okay . I just flashed back to my first and third marriages there . Let me ... Okay , I 'm sorry . I don 't know why . I don 't know why I made a joke . Dr. Graystone , what is your take on this ? You 're out here saying that Zoe was crazy . Zoe wasn 't crazy . She wasn 't . Zoe was angry . She was defiant . She was rude . She was frustrating . Okay . Well , show me a 15-year-old girl who isn 't . She slammed her door . She played loud music . She said that we embarrassed her in public . She slammed her door and ... She was a kid . Slammed her door and played loud music and blew up a commuter train . Well , when was I supposed to call the cops ? Well , I don 't know . Maybe when she started worshipping the big destructo-god in the sky , maybe ? No , we ... We didn 't know . There weren 't any signs . You said she was troubled . She was angry . That 's the better word . My wife is right . Okay . Angry , but I 'd also like to add morally blank , because the virtual world is a poor teacher , and doesn 't teach you boundaries . Yes . Okay , well ... You know who would completely agree with that , is Zoe . And that 's exactly how the STO got to her . Okay . I 'm sorry . You have to slow down and back up . And keep in mind , half of this audience is stoned . Okay . Okay . She ... She saw things in the virtual world . Ritual sacrifices . Games like New Cap City . And she felt the absence of moral guidelines , just like you do , like a lot of folks do . And into that absence , steps the STO , offering this marvelous ultimate moral arbiter . It 's quite appealing for a teenage girl , especially . You 're assuming all of this . No . No , I talked to her . You did ? When ? After she died . I created a virtual version of her . An avatar . You created ... I 'm sorry . You ... You made an electronic ghost of your dead daughter . I just wanted to hear the sound of her voice again . I sympathize . I sympathize . This is very disturbing . Yes . Yes . It is disturbing . But show me a parent who would not do anything possible to try and understand their child . Okay . Well ... It was disturbing . I know that . Hey . But I was trying to make sense ... You got a bracelet ? There 's a plastic bracelet for backstage visitors . I used the tools , the gifts that I have to do that . And I know she wasn 't real . But ... But I could use that ID badge . I used the tools , the gifts that I have to do that . But it did offer some small insight into her motivations . If this whole thing was a reaction to the V-World , then we 're just right back at square one , though , aren 't we ? Isn 't technology the problem ? I mean , isn 't the V-World the problem ? No . That 's not the problem . Maybe . I 'm sorry . Maybe ? Maybe . Okay . I 'm starting to like you , Mr. Graystone . We thought we could control the content in V-World . Especially for kids . But we failed , clearly . I think the temptation to hack the code is too great . All right . Look , then , what is your solution ? I don 't know . Well , think out loud . I don 't know . I ... For there to be any beneficial change , you 'd have to take away the profit motive . Like when they legalized drugs , for instance . Okay . Well , that 's a good point , but you 're also talking about something that took decades of some pretty violent arguing back and forth . Well , you know , why not ? Why couldn 't we ... Why couldn 't we try it ? But this is a huge leap you 're talking about . No . Graystone Industries will no longer charge for licensing of any legal spaces . And any profit we make off the bands will go to some charity or ... A foundation that we can create . We 'll create something for young people to find the right experiences and the right values . Okay . This is ... You 're saying this now , and I support it . I think this is very admirable . Are you going to say this Monday to your stockholders and your board of directors ? Great PR . No , that 's great PR . Yes . It 's 60 % of our net . My company will make no more profit on the Holobands or V-World licensing . Hold me to it , Caprica . Okay . Well , speaking for Caprica , and you know that I like to , we will . Wow . Thank you , Doctors Graystone . This was a fascinating discussion ... Yes . ... that I was completely unprepared for . Thank you very much . And I think we need to credit Amanda with the most amazing save since ... She 's on there ? She 's not supposed to be . Let 's pick an analogy where the Bucs won , okay ? Okay . I don 't let my guests ... I could kill her with my own hands . And sleep well every night . Couldn 't you ? All right ! I see a lot of panicked faces behind me . This might take a while . I can see that . You should probably go on home . All right . Well , I got a taxi , so ... I can get you a car . I can get another one . I 'll see you at home . Love you . Thanks again . Yeah . Excuse me . Sorry . I 'm Baxter 's driver . If you like , I could take you home . Yeah . Perfect . Thank you . Yeah . What 's your name ? I 'm Sam . Nice to meet you . I 'm Amanda . Nice to meet you . You saved my life with this one . So , um ... Did you have something in your locker ? Did you get a warning ? I can 't tell you . I can 't . I just can 't . I get why you 're being cautious . That 's smart . But I have to do this . I have to go to Gemenon and take Zoe 's package with me . I have to . If there is any way you can help me ... Uh ... I can maybe set up a meeting with Barnabas . That 's all I can do . He 's the one who can decide if you get the STO 's help . Yes . Thank you . I ... Are those homemade ? I 'm sorry . What ? Your tattoos . Are they homemade ? I 'm sorry . I don 't mean to pry , but I 'm a plastic surgeon . I 'm really interested in that sort of thing . They 're cultural . Tauron . Oh , yes , of course . They have meanings , right ? Yeah . A lot of people here on Caprica think they mean that you 're a gangster , but they don 't . Of course not . Well , I mean , it might , but it doesn 't have to . You know , you get ink because you 're a parent , or you got a fancy pedigree , or if there 's some sort of ritual . Maybe you made a mistake . I could give you a fancy pedigree . I could add a few accomplishments , take away a few mistakes . Yeah , well , that wouldn 't be real , I 'm afraid . Very little is real these days . This isn 't the way home . Come on , Sam . Don 't . Gods . Larry , hi . Listen , I need to get a hold of Sam . And it 's an emergency and it 's ... He won 't answer his phone . Please . Have him call me as soon as you hear from him . Okay ? Thanks . Turn on your frakking phone ! Excuse me . This isn 't the way home . Yeah , there was an accident on the thruway . I 'm just going to cut through Little Tauron . Don 't worry . It 's good people here . Not very nosy . Which is a good thing , right ? What with all those people angry about all those deaths . I lost my sister-in-law and my niece on that train . My Gods . I 'm so sorry . Yeah . Well , you can 't turn back time . Nothing I can do to change that now . Yeah . I guess all we can try and do is understand . Or look for some kind of balance . Maybe try to even things out . My sister-in-law 's name was Shannon . My niece was named Tamara . She was going to make us all proud . Sam . Hey . Larry hates it when I come home bloody . Did you do it ? I can 't hear you over the water . Is it done ? Yeah , it 's done . Why do you think I 'm washing up , huh ? She was getting a little apo-playk-tay in the car . I didn 't want to fight in a closed space . So I ordered her out of the car . Said we were having engine trouble , she should go inside this restaurant . Connie 's Place . Remember ? We used to go there in high school ? I know Connie 's Place . Yeah . I sent her inside , right ? Jacks . Nice . And she notices right away that there 's no one inside . 'Cause I called ahead , just in case . So we 're standing in the front , with the knives , sfa-ghi-dess . Yeah . Frak . She tries to get out back to the alley , but it 's locked . You killed her in the kitchen ? Well , that stuff they spray at crime scenes ? Can 't tell the difference between the animal blood and human blood . You really did it . No , I 'm messing with you to teach you a lesson about yanking me around like this . Wait . What ? Are you ... Was that sarcastic ? What do you think ? I can 't tell , Sam ! Stop frakking around . Did you kill her ? I don 't turn off my phone , Yoseef . I 've got other people who call me , you know ? So , yeah . I got your , like , sixty text messages . I didn 't kill her . I scared her a bit . Bet she 's getting a lot of that right now . You 're frakking with me . Oh , yeah . I 'm frakking with you because I knew you couldn 't go through with it . Frakking Caprican in a Tauron body . No . No , I talked to her . You did ? When ? Again . Weren 't you watching this earlier ? After she died . I created a virtual version of her . An avatar . Yeah , well , I like it . It seems like every time this family is on TV , I get so much out of it . ... dead daughter . I just wanted to hear the sound of her voice again . Feeling better ? Yeah , I 'm fine . I guess people are just really scared and angry right now . I don 't blame them . I think , from now on , we both need to be a little more careful . So , you made an avatar of Zoe . It was nothing . You know how it works . Just a picture of her . Nothing more . Yeah . I know how an avatar works . And so do you . Why did you do it ? Why didn 't you tell me ? I didn 't know it got that bad . I mean ... You could have talked to me . I know . I just ... I miss her . You know ? Yeah , I know . I just miss her . I miss her , too . I really ... I really do . Want to watch TV ? The Graystones are on Sarno tonight . I heard they were really good . I 'm so sick of them . They 're everywhere . Awful . Rich . Disgusting . Ridiculous people .

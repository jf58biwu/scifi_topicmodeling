 Previously on warehouse 13 ... Rebecca St. Clair ? You found Jack . You weren 't just his girlfriend . You 're a Warehouse agent . I always knew if we didn 't quit , one of us , one day , would lose the other . One last thing that you might be interested in seeing . " Together forever . " I guess Jack chose you over the Warehouse after all . It says that the de-bronze function was activated twice . Who 's our mystery guest ? Pete , Artie says that H.G. Wells is actually ... A woman . I was apprenticed at Warehouse 12 . My daughter , Christina , had been murdered . Everything that ever mattered in my life is gone now , except the Warehouse . I want to come back and work there again . She is nothing like me . I 'll never trust that woman . H.G. Wells is to be fully reinstated as a Warehouse agent . What are you doing here ? No ! No ! Ugh ! Do I make you nervous , darling ? No . Not nervous . Why would you make me nervous ? You 're part of the team now and not evil . Artie . Good . Morning . Good morning , Artie . Why is no one here ? I 'm here . Congratulations , we 'll have a gold star delivered to your room . - Where are the others ? - Right here . Hey , guys . Claude , did you drop something ? Uh , yeah , I just had a little slippery fingers . I make her nervous . Claude , there 's no need for you to be nervous . I 'm not , I wasn 't . Jeez . It 's okay . There will be a period of adjustment . Although , I have already earned a gold star . Why does she get a gold star ? She doesn 't . Let 's talk about your next assignment . Shouldn 't there be some sort of orientation for H. G ? It 's not necessary . Let 's not make a fuss . Yeah , you already got a gold star . There is no gold star , there won 't be orientation . It 's bad enough she 's here at all . Can we just try to get through this ? Well , now I 'm nervous . Why do things have to change because of her ? I mean , if we 're moving to a gold star system ... Excuse me . Rebecca ? Are you kids still in the artifact finding business ? Jonah Ross , 82 , local English teacher . Died of natural causes . A friend of yours ? Hardly . Jonah Ross was actually Jonah Raitt . In 1961 , he was an editor of Where When magazine . He killed three of his secretaries . And his wife . He used an artifact that altered their body chemistry . Skin , bone , muscle , blood . Turned them all to glass . Jack and I never found him or the artifact . Two of the women died before we got on the glass girl case . We could have saved Raitt 's wife and Roxanne Crane . But Raitt did something to us . We had no memory the entire day they were killed . Then he disappeared . All those years , Raitt and I were living in the same city . I went to his address to I.D. And retrieve the artifact , but ... You didn 't find anything . He wrote this obituary himself . Read the last line . " If you 're still out there , Jack and Rebecca , thanks for my life . " You think he was taunting you ? He was a cruel son of a bitch . The artifact is still out there and in play . No one else should die because I couldn 't crack down on this . We need to find it . All right , I 'll go to St. Louis . I 'll check out the house again . Claudia , forward me the info . I could use the field time . Uh , Artie , you don 't want us to go ? No , I got this . It 's getting a little crowded around here . Artie , I 'd like to come with you . Fine . We 'll find it . You say you both blacked out ? Apparently , Jack and I went about our lives . We just couldn 't remember it . We assumed that Jonah caused it . Was it 24 hours exactly ? No , it was 22 hours and 19 minutes . I 'm very observant . Why ? I don 't care if it is the H.G. Wells section , what the hell are we doing down here ? Why does it matter that it was 22 hours and 19 minutes ? What does it mean ? It means someone used my time machine . It 's not a vehicle like in my novel . Physical time travel is an impossibility . Okay , so it 's not a time machine ? It 's a temporal consciousness transfer engine . A means to traverse the space time continuum using one 's mind . So it is a time machine ? Not exactly . I 'd become intrigued by the idea of Gestalt , the collective unconscious . What if one were able to connect with the mind of someone who lived centuries ago ? It happens randomly in nature . Past life experience . Oh , right , right . Like Russell Crowe was a Tasmanian convict in the 1800s . I read it online . My machine allows your mind to inhabit the body of someone in the past . See what they see , feel what they feel . Live a day in history . And you 've done it ? You 've actually travelled through time ? Ah , that must have been so awesome . No , not really . Okay , so , uh , what about the person , you know , possessed ? They black out for 22 hours and 19 minutes . That 's how long the trip lasts . Never could work out why . Are you saying that someone used , or will use , this machine to inhabit Jack and me in 1961 ? It would explain your losing time . Hey , this doesn 't look like it belongs here . You might want to take a look at this . " Dear Charlie , do me a favor " and put this in the H. G. Wells storage area . " I won 't ask about it , don 't bring it up . Trust me . Jack . " That 's not Jack 's handwriting . I know . It 's mine . Hey , I 'm ... I 'm ready . Yeah , uh , listen , you don 't really have to tag along . I know . I just thought it would be nice if we could spend some time together . Maybe after we find the artifact , go for dinner and a movie . Really ? No . Is this really how it 's going to be ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . You can 't keep freezing me out because I supported Helena joining the Warehouse . Oh , it 's Helena now , is it ? If it 's all right with you , I 'll just keep calling her the villain . Artie , you 're being childish . Do you know what it takes to keep a Warehouse agent alive ? Myka , trusting the agent beside you has your back . I couldn 't trust McPherson , could I ? Could I ? He 's the one who let H.G. Out . How the hell am I supposed to trust her ? Helena has proven more than once that she has my back . I thought I 'd proven that I had yours . You know what ? On second thought , I 'll just handle this one on my own . So , Artie decided to check out Raitt 's apartment on his own . What ? I know this is going to sound nuts . I 'm sure you 're sitting there , arms folded , twirling your hair , biting your lip , not wanting to believe this , but ... I 'm you . I 'm Myka . Inside Rebecca . Well , your mind , anyway . We 've traveled back through time . I 'm Pete . Hi , Pete . Hi , me . I can 't believe this . This ... This isn 't possible . We don 't have a lot of time . Can you be serious ? Don 't give Rebecca back her body all tensed up like that . Pete . Focus . Yoink . It is you guys . Listen , Myka . Pete is going to try to convince you to use the time machine to travel back to 1961 to identify an artifact . It 's okay . Pete 's actually right for a change . And Pete , Get your ass to Mars . Get your ass to Mars . Mars . Like Total Recall . Oh , I love that movie . Okay , we 're done . Oh , there 's one last thing you need to know before you get here . The artifact is a ... Hey , are you okay ? It 's just seeing Jack again . Um , well , what about the butterfly effect ? You know , when you step on a butterfly in the past , it changes the whole future . No , I tried to change the past , I failed . Look , it 'll be strictly recon , right ? We 'll go back , get eyes on the artifact and track it in the here and now . Maybe we should wait for Artie . Every moment you wait , it risks another person 's life in the present . Well , I did tell me to do it . Oh , sweet . Pete and Myka 's excellent adventure . It 's funny . It was after this case that Jack and I fell in love . It was the day we blacked out . I woke up in an orchard and Jack was kissing me . Our first kiss . I was so surprised . I mean , I always fancied him , but he was always so mean to me . All right , I hooked up the machine to the main power grid . That 's definitely enough juice for it to run the full day . Okay . Whoa , wait . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Out of curiosity , what happens to us if Jack and Rebecca bite it while we 're inside their bodies ? Hoping not . I suspect your minds will be lost forever . Hoping not . Oh , good . Just making sure it 's as bad as I thought . I couldn 't change the past , but maybe you can . So is there a big countdown ? Uh . No . Okay . The time machine set us on fire ! The time machine set us on fire ! Pete ! Pete , it 's okay . It 's okay . Look . We 're in 1961 . Uh-huh . Myka , check it out . We 're ... Jack and Rebecca . I was going to say still hot , but , yes , that too . My God . Are we done fixing our hair and makeup , ladies ? Who 's the old goat ? Charlie Martin . He 's our Artie . You think this is a good place to catch 40 winks ? Uh , no , Sir . No . You 're right , Charlie . It 's not her fault . See , I had kind of a thing there . And it was ... Don 't blame him , really . It 's a rough morning for both of us . Sorry , Rebecca . Rough morning . Maybe you should take the rest of the day off . Or maybe you should get back to work . We 're very sorry , Mr. Martin , sir . We 'll just get back to work . Yes , we 're sorry . Sir , thank you . Sir ? Mr. Martin . What is this ? What 's going on ? You two don 't cover for each other . You 're mean to each other . What gives ? Ah , yes . Right . The meanness ... Jerk . ... we have for each other . Hate you . I need you in Calcutta . You 're off the glass girl case . Wait a minute , what ? What ? - What do you mean ? - Not a discussion . Gus is getting close to Man Ray 's camera , I need you on that . If another glass girl turns up , we 'll get back into it . Look , this comes directly from Mrs. Frederic . So , if you want to piss her off and have her give you that stare , go ahead . Lady terrifies me . Look , Charlie , all we need is one more day . I 've already got a job lined up at the magazine , and Jack is going to talk to Raitt 's wife . I am ? Yes . It was in Rebecca 's ... My ... My file . If we don 't find anything , then Calcutta . Fine . 24 hours . No more . Oh , Charlie , we 're going to need everything that you can find on Jonah Raitt . Of course , Rebecca . Anything you need . After all I 'm your secretary , right ? I really don 't like him . He 's a bit of a sphincter . Mmm-hmm . I 'm going to go interview Raitt 's wife . I 'll meet you back at the magazine , okay ? Unbelievable . I know . Steaks for a dollar . No , no , I mean ... No , no , no . I know what you mean , but a dollar ! What ... What , hey , hey . What ? I want you to be careful in there , okay ? If he 's got an artifact in his office , just get eyes on it . Don 't engage . He 's obviously a nut bar . I 'll be fine . When you talk to Mrs. Raitt , just remember , it 's 1961 , okay ? Women slap men when they get fresh . Huh ? What ? I am a capable woman . You are just a tape recorder . You ... Oh , no . No , no , no , no , no ! First day ? Yeah . Roxanne . Thank you for your time , Mrs. Raitt . The Secret Service , that must be so exciting . Well , it has its moments . Well , if the President 's coming , it 's a good thing you 're making sure the neighborhood is safe . It 's just a precaution . Can 't be too careful . Isn 't that true ? You know , we voted for him . There was something about that Nixon I just didn 't trust . Good call . So , is there anything new around here ? Something your husband may have brought home from the office ? He killed his three secretaries . And his wife . Are you all right ? Yeah . I mean yes , ma 'am . Four women murdered cruelly and unnaturally . I just ... I had a feeling . You look so happy in that photo . Agent Secord , does the president have reason to be concerned about my marriage ? No . No , Ma 'am . No reason . Thank you so much . You know , I really like your bracelet . Thanks . It was a gift . From whom ? Was there someone that you 're ... Ladies . This is a place of business , not a sewing circle . Certainly , Mr. Raitt . How can you tell if , um ... Oh , uh , it , uh , uses a lot of power . But don 't worry , the Warehouse can take it . Not the Warehouse I 'm worried about . I hate this . I was talking to Beth and I kept thinking , " You have no idea that you 're going to die today . Today . " I mean , how is that fair ? It 's not . Rebecca , you seem to have gotten the hang of that dictation . You 're practically a natural . Oh , no , not really . I 'm going to be leaving for the day . Goodnight , Roxanne , I 'll see you in the morning . Yes . In the morning . Have a good night , Mr. Raitt . Well , I should probably call it a night . Good night . She 's lying . They both are . They 're obviously meeting up tonight . Do people not know how to lie in 1961 ? That 's the Roxanne , the next victim . We can 't think of her like that . How can we not ? That guy is going to kill her and his wife . There 's nothing that we can do . Recon only . The timeline . Screw the timeline , okay ? I 'm going after Raitt . You stay here and search his office . Maybe he stashed the artifact . Pete , no ! You can 't ! Sweetheart , I am going to need these collated and filed by the end of business today . Thanks , honey . Honey ? Sweetheart ? Listen , bub , I ... Pete ? There . That ought to be enough to stabilize it , at least until the fluctuations ... Claudia . What 's this ? Artie , hey . What are you doing here ? Well , there was nothing at Raitt 's apartment . What are you doing here ? Well , we had a power issue because of this ... It 's a funny story . Oh , my God . What happened ? Are you all right ? Yes . Yes . I 'm fine . Just a little bit dizzy . Hold on . I 'll get you some water , all right ? Nice work , Miss Streep . Next time , let 's try it with an accent . I just didn 't want Artie to ... Martinis . Thank you . Hey . Jackie O , huh ? Who ? Uh ... Jackie Kennedy . I mean like , " Oh , wow , she 's foxy . " What do you got there ? I mean , look at this , it 's a relic . This stuff was outdated in the ' 50 's . Yeah , I 'm more of a Sports Illustrated guy myself . Better . Yeah . Of course , if you ask me , they could stand to spice to things up a little bit . Add a little cheesecake , and maybe have a swimsuit issue . Got an eye for the ladies , huh ? I do . You know , they say that God made us in his image . It makes me think that God must be a woman . I mean , look at her . She 's stunning , right ? But this magazine , it does its best to make her seem dull . She should be admired , like a work of art . Go back to Pete and Myka . Are you sure you 're okay ? I 'm fine . I 'm fine . No more sniffing glue , young lady . Hey . Um , Rebecca , I 'm sorry . Don 't be sorry . Just a little bit too much excitement for this old gal . It 's very ungentlemanly to rifle through a lady 's handbag . Well , when you collapsed , I wanted to check to see if you were taking any medication , and I had to look up Erlop ... Erlotinib . You know , in a way , I 'm lucky . Most Warehouse agents don 't usually live long enough to die of cancer . What kind of prognosis ... Grim . And that 's optimistic . You know , I always said I 'd find that artifact if it was the last thing I did . Rebecca , we 'll find it . It was nice talking to you . You too . Cigarette , sir ? Uh , no thanks . Myka ? Hello . What are you doing here ? This is a gentlemen 's only club . Well , interestingly enough , if you 're wearing one of these outfits , nobody bothers to look at your face . Look , don 't try and talk me out of this , okay ? Raitt 's our guy . He 's been talking about turning women into art . Pete . Oh , great , he 's gone . Excuse me . I 'm sorry . Do you know where Jonah Raitt went ? Oh , I 'm sorry , sir . He just drove off . Damn it . Good work , Myka . Forget trying to stop him . How are we supposed to I.D. The artifact now ? Give me the Farnsworth . So nice of both of you to check in . I 'm touched . You need to quit smoking , man . Charlie , did you get any of that information on Raitt I asked you for ? It was the highlight of my day . Well , were there any hotel receipts ? What ? Hotel ? Oh , right . Because the dude 's stepping out on his wife , then ... He 's not inviting them home . Wrong again , Rebecca . He is inviting them home . Wait , come again ? Raitt took a deduction last year on a second residence . A one-bedroom at 15 Hoover Street . Must be a side pad where he engages in sexual congress with his secretaries . And Rebecca , nice catch . You 're teacher 's pet in every decade , aren 't you ? The file said that Roxanne was killed on Hoover Street . Let 's go . She 's going to be fine , Claudia . I assure you . So , where 'd you go when you used your time machine ? Uh , mani-pedies with Cleopatra ? Snog with Casanova ? Paris , 1899 . Why ? That 's , um ... That 's where I 'd arranged for my daughter Christina to spend the summer with cousins . I was away a great deal . A single working mother , to use today 's parlance . One day , Christina awoke with a fever . Sophie , the housekeeper , had her stay in bed . Um , the men who came to rob my cousin 's home were expecting an empty house . Sophie tried to fight them , but there were too many . She survived but , um , Christina ... Sophie had no recollection of the 22 hours and 19 minutes during which the incident occurred . And when one of the thieves was finally captured , he described how Sophie had fought using Kempo , a fighting style that I favored , and I began to suspect ... I knew . I just knew that somehow , I had travelled back in time and become Sophie . Eventually I constructed the machine , determined to alter the course of events . But the ink with which our lives are inscribed is indelible . I imagine losing a child is the worst pain a person can go through . No , actually . When I tracked them down , what I did to the men who killed my daughter , that 's the most pain a person can go through . Roxanne . Jeepers . You scared the life out of me . Roxanne , you 're in danger . Danger ? Rebecca , what are you doing here ? We know what 's going on between you and Raitt . I have to go . No . Listen to me ! Pete ! Pete , look at me . Just don 't do this . No . I 'm not going to let her die , Myka . Pete , you know that you can 't stop this ! Roxanne , wait ! What are you doing here ? No ! No ! I know you . You were at the club . Are you following me ? My God . That 's Roxanne 's bracelet . What happened ? Look , we can 't explain this , but ... She 's dead . We 're sorry . It 's not him . Raitt 's not our guy . And we don 't have much time to find out who is . All right , first thing that we need to do is reanalyze the data . This place still does that , huh ? Yeah . Artie , what are you doing ? Oh . There 's a power clot in one of the secure storage sectors . It 's probably nothing . I 'll flush it out . Send down a micro-pulse . Artie , no ! The connection 's holding , but something 's just completely burnt out the reintegration wiring . Which means what ? I can 't bring them back . When Jack and Rebecca awaken , Pete and Myka will be lost forever . The power level 's dropping ! Well , it 's overheating . We need something to cool it down . On it ! Whatever you 're doing to my people , it stops now . Myka . Myka , are you okay ? Oh , God . What the hell was that ? I don 't know . Do you ... Do you think something went wrong ? Oh , Roxanne . What did this ? Look , Raitt , you need to tell us what you know . Who would want to hurt them ? I don 't know how something like this ... What do you mean them ? Meredith and Ruth . The two other women who worked for your company . No . I got a note from them . They 're in Los Angeles for research . They never left that note . So this ... This happened to them too ? Look , I know this is a shock , but you were sleeping with these women . Now , who would want to hurt them ? I wasn 't sleeping with them ! I was trying to take over the magazine . I was trying to get rid of the publisher and take control of Where When myself . It needs artistic vision and independent thinking . So they were helping you ? Yeah . They were completely undervalued by that company and capable of so much more . What , do you think someone found out and was trying to stop us ? No . No . But we need to get to Beth . We think she might be next . My wife ? Look , she has nothing to do with this . How do you even know that ? I can 't tell you , but just trust me , we 've got to get there now . You touch my wife , I swear to God ... Artie ? What are you doing ? She 's killing them . I tried to explain that this is a form of time travel . Time travel 's a physical impossibility . No . We know . This works on your mind . So does she . Artie pulsed the system . That 's what burnt out the wiring . I wouldn 't have pulsed the system if I knew what you were doing . If we 'd have asked , you 'd have said no . You bet your ass I would have said no ! Claudia , this is not your fault . You see the best in people . People like her take advantage of people like you . I 'm not quite so naive . Am I naive ? I asked them to do this . If you 're going to shoot the one responsible , fire away . If we don 't fix this , we 'll lose them . They 'll die . Stand over me . Watch my every move . But let me save them . And if they die , I won 't bother re-bronzing you . What do you need ? A new power source , quickly . Beth ? Beth , are you here ? Look , don 't worry , we 'll find her . Pete ... I mean ... I mean Jack is looking outside . If she 's not here , that 's good , right ? Why is that good , Jonah ? Oh , my God ! Thank God you 're all right . We were so worried about you . You shouldn 't be . I tried to make it so you 'd never have to worry . Ever . And we 'd always be okay . Listen , Beth , there 's a terrible thing that 's happened . Meredith , Ruth , and Roxanne have been killed . Hmm . So you went right out and got yourself another whore . What ? I took care of the others , and you just bring another one around ? You killed those women ? I hoped you 'd get the message . Maybe I should 've been more obvious . Jonah ! Look , Beth , there 's got to be another way , okay ? Or maybe there 's been ... I think there 's been some sort of misunderstanding . You shoot your little ray gun there and hit my husband . That 's all I need to understand . Maybe not all . Ah ! Pete ! No ! It has to stay in ! Pete , this is probably going to hurt ! It already does ! Okay ! Come on ! Beth ? Pete ! Pete ! Jonah ? I wish you 'd loved me more . Oh , Beth . Those poor girls . I wish you 'd loved me less . So this ... This is why we made that movie to send to ourselves . Because we knew we 'd not only get eyes on the artifact , but we 'd actually snag it . Yeah , but we can 't take it back to the future , so what was the point ? What if we could get it back to the future ? What if we could hide it somewhere we knew would exist 50 years from now ? Somewhere safe , somewhere where only we could get to it . Warehouse . But , Pete , we still need to make that movie , and we 're running out of time . When are we not running out of time ? Well , where the hell are we going to find a camera ? Huh ? 99 , would you believe the credenza ? Jonah , I don 't know how to explain this , but you 've got to run . Run ? Why ? Roxanne , the other women , now you 're wife . You 're the prime suspect . But you can tell the police that it was Beth and that I 'm innocent . We can 't . We won 't be in town long enough to tell anyone anything . Okay , so where am I supposed to go ? St. Louis . You have to trust me . You 'll be safe in St. Louis . And we 're sorry to have to ask you this , but we need a favor . We need you to mail this movie . It will clear your name someday . Trust us . Jonah , good luck . We 're not going to have enough time to get the knife back . How far are we from the warehouse ? We can make it . They 're not going to make it . We 're not going to make it . We should have mailed the knife too . Are you kidding me ? Do you remember the last time someone mailed an artifact ? Oh , right . Doctor Doomsday A Go-Go . But ... Oh , God . Are you okay ? Yeah , it 's just the headaches are getting worse . What if ... What ? Just a little bit of history repeating . Rebecca said Jack kissed her under a tree in a cherry orchard . This must be where they woke up . We were coming here all along . Should we just leave the knife with Jack and Rebecca ? Well , we can 't . They won 't know what it is when they wake up . And they might think it 's a letter opener and glass themselves paying the electric bill . How about ... How about right here ? Okay . Here ? Okay . Yeah . We should have just enough time to get them back . If this works . The power 's not transferring . I don 't know what else to do . Pete , what are you doing ? Rebecca spent her whole life blaming herself because she couldn 't find the artifact . If I can tell her where it is , then ... Pete , it won 't work . It never works . The past can 't change . Yeah , and neither can I. Back in the old days , when things didn 't work ... Mine too . Works for me . Can 't you see we have to keep trying ? If we just accept fate , then we 're not better than ... Are we back ? Are we in deep doo-doo ? Oh , more than you can imagine . Oh , no , man . I dropped the note . You guys look freaked out . Did ... Did something happen ? No . No . Did you see the artifact ? Not only did we see it , we know where it is . It 's safe . Were you able to save any of those women ? Well , I guess you can 't change the past no matter how hard you try . That machine . Does it still work ? Don 't tell us you want us to go back and get another artifact . No . But I would like to see Jack again . One more time . Well , the circuitry 's severely damaged , and the trip wouldn 't last more than a few moments . I wouldn 't be able to bring you back . Why would I want to come back ? Hey . So , Pete recovered the knife . Good . Turns out that artifact was the basis of the Cinderella story . Only , instead of how in the story , a young girl meets a handsome prince who gives her a glass slipper , Cinderella used the knife to ... Let 's just say they tend to re-edit these things for children . We like things simple when we 're kids . Black and white . Good and evil . Sometimes I wish things still were that simple . She did good , didn 't she ? Rebecca ? Yeah . She did real good . No , I meant , you know , Helena . Yeah . And so did you . Becks ? Where the hell are we ? It 's okay . We 're all right . The last thing I remember , I was sitting in the Warehouse and ... It doesn 't matter . Jack , I missed you so much . Missed me ? Jack , what are you doing ? What I should have done a long time ago .

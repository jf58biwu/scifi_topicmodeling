 ( AUDIENCE APPLAUDING ) Silence , puny audience ! And welcome to Who Dares To Be A Millionaire ? Tremble before Morbo 's mighty likability , as I chitchat with our first contestant , Philip J. Fry . ( AUDIENCE APPLAUDING ) Give him hell , Morbo ! Prepare for pleasantries ! So , Fry , what do you do for a living ? Me ? Can I phone a friend ? Chitchat achieved ! Are you ready to play ? I didn 't come to play , I came to win . Now let 's play . For $ 1 , what tool is used to hammer a nail ? Is it , A , a hammer ? B , a nail ? - C ... - B , Nail ! Final answer ! ( BUZZER SOUNDS ) HERMES : Sweet dodo of Lesotho ! Don 't you ever stop to think before you speak ? I never stop to think about it . Leave Fry alone . His intelligence is just a little differenty . You a big dummy ! Hey , I 'm beginning to think you guys don 't think I 'm very smart . You can barely remember your own name , Einstein . Einstein is a hard name to remember . Ow ! Smeesh , Professor . Don 't have a shmaneurysm . Fry 's your distant relative . Not distant enough . I 'll be a monkey 's uncle if I 'm this monkey 's nephew . ( SNIFFLES ) But you 're my only family . Who will hug me if I achieve something ? Oh , perhaps I 've been too harsh . Come , lad , take my hand and I 'll explain why I find you so repugnant . All my life , I 've been inspired by great minds . Euclid , Copernicus , Braino . And my personal role model , Leonardo da Vinci . What turned them to stone ? Da Vinci was history 's greatest artist and inventor . Voila ! He invented flying machines , war engines , submarines . Uh-oh . Nibbler died in the wall . That 's not Nibbler . That 's my most precious possession . Leonardo 's beard ! I paid a fortune for it at an auction of historic body parts . I suppose if I have an Achilles ' heel , it 's because I bought it at that same auction . Indeed so . Most indeededly . Careful with that , you fool ! No ! No ! But possibly yes . What is it , Professor ? Oh , my ! It 's da Vinci 's fabled lost invention . Even the scholars who wrote of this device had no idea what it was for . And now , at last , neither do I ! Maybe we can figure it out . We ? ( LAUGHS ) Well , I may not have brain smarts , but at least I have street smarts . I was in the hospital two weeks . No one visited me . Quiet , you ! I 'm trying to deduce the function of da Vinci 's lost invention . Not even a card . He might have hidden a clue in one of his other works . Ergo , I sent Bender out for a copy of The Last Supper . BENDER : I 'm back ! Everybody at Kinko 's was an idiot , so I just brought the original . ( GRUNTING ) Jesus Christ , and his 12 Apostles . That 's odd . This hand here doesn 't belong to anybody . And it 's pointing a knife at James the Lesser ! That 's the great thing about that hand . And what about these funky table legs ? It 's like they 're from some other , funkier painting . Maybe da Vinci painted over something else . It 's called a pentimento . That 's true , Dr. Zoidberg . How did you know that ? My doctorate is in art history . Let 's see what 's under The Last Supper . Wait a second ! I 'm not big-boned , I 'm just fat . My God ! Look ! ( ALL GASP ) My God ! I 'm looking ! My God ! Saint James was a robot ! My God ! Da Vinci left his legs unpainted as a clue . My God ! This is the greatest mystery of all time . We must fly to Rome and exhume the body of Saint James . - Didn 't we used to be a delivery company ? - To the ship . Psst . Leela , wanna join the mile-deep club ? - Sure , why not ? - ( GASPS ) No time ! I 've found a clue that could unlock all the secrets of history . ( GROANS ) Look at these Roman numerals . Roman numerals ? I 've got it ! We 're in Rome ! Don 't be stupid . It 's a long-Iost mathematical code . I 'll need to consult these ancient writings . Some preposterous hogwash about the Fibonacci sequence ... Aha ! The markings indicate how many paces we need to take . One ... Okay , we 're there . Brothers and sisters , let us pry . It 's true ! Saint James really was a robot . I bet he 's up in robot heaven right now . So he won 't miss his eyes . ( POWERING UP ) ( ALL GASP ) My God ! Robot Saint James is a zombie . Nay , I am not Saint James . Enough of your lies , Saint James . We saw you in The Last Supper . The great man Leonardo built me as an artist 's model . When I took repose in this coffin , I carefully tossed the real Saint James in yonder heap . I 'm sure you have many questions . Come , there is a chamber where I used to speak with Pope John the Patient . I told him I 'd be back in five minutes . Well , he 'll make a nice heap . I am Animatronio , guardian of da Vinci 's great secret . He left my legs visible in the painting as a clue , then dispatched me hither to await his shadow society of intellectuals . Hi , Animatronio . You personally knew da Vinci ? ( SHRIEKS ) Was he nice ? How did his hair smell ? And on a personal note , what is the function of this device ? Halt ! You know not the function of the machina magnifica ? Then thou art not members of the shadow society ! The what now ? Not one more word shall I breathe . Not even about the great fountain where thou mayest find the ... Wait ... Thou didst not know about the fountain , didst thou ? Curses ! I must be punished . ( GROANING ) Quick , we must find out what he knows before he flays himself to death ! - Where is the great fountain ? - What makes it so great ? Why does a robot need a codpiece ? Fie , thou fen-suckled bum-bailey ! Thou willst never pry information from these mechanical lips ! Just tell us , already . Okay , the fountain thou seekest is ... ( GROANING ) And so dies our hope of solving this mystery . Come on , gang . Let 's go home . Wait ! Let 's not give up so easily . Animatronio mentioned a fountain . That 's a statue of Neptune , god of water . The number of points on his trident is three , or trey . The " U " in his name is written like " V. " Trey , " V. " Trevi ! It 's the Trevi fountain ! - There can be no question ! - But , Professor ... There can be no question ! Wow , it hasn 't changed in 1,000 years . Okay , everyone , into the fountain . What are you , senile ? I 'm not jumping in there . Hey , look . Coins . ( GUNSHOTS FIRING ) I got 48 cents . ( GASPS ) There 's one more nickel , and it 's a big one ! Quickly , into the sewer hole . Why ? ( ALL SCREAMING ) What 's this dump ? My God ! It 's the Pantheon ! This place is 3,000 years old . What could possibly be left to discover ? Maybe something about ourselves , Leela . Wait ! What 's under that blanket ? My God ! Da Vinci 's Vitruvian Man ! It 's truly a masterpiece . Note how the perspective lines draw the eye right to his dong . Say , what 's this ? Anyone hear something ? It 's a coin slot . Bender , insert that giant nickel . Sure . - ( GROANS ) - Hush , Bender ! What 's your game , Vitruvian Man ? - Whoa ! - Whoa ! FARNSWORTH : I withdraw the question , Vitruvian Man . Da Vinci 's lost workshop ! At the risk of sounding stupid , do these things actually work ? Of course not , stupid ! I mean , that flying machine 's as aerodynamic as a sofa ! How could it possibly get off the ground ? In a way thou shalt never discover ! ( ALL GASP ) Hi , Animatronio . I feign death and stalk thee , that I might preserve the greatest of Leonardo 's secrets ! ( EX CLAIMS ) All right , buddy , we want secrets ! And they 'd better be ancient ! ( SPEAKS ITALIAN ) Never shall I reveal how these wondrous machines fit together ! They fit together ? I said no such thing . And then I died ! ( GROANING ) You 're right , Professor . This thing doesn 't fly . Don 't sit in there , you idiot ! That 's dangerous ! ( EX CLAIMS ) ( GASPS ) No wonder this contraption isn 't aerodynamic ! It 's not an aircraft , it 's a spacecraft ! ( SHOUTS ) As I live , thou shan 't discover the great secret ! FRY : Bye , Animatronio ! My God ! Why would Leonardo 's machine have brought us here ? I don 't know . Let 's ask this guy . I am Leonardo . ( BOTH GASP ) Welcome to Planet Vinci . FARNSWORTH : My God ! FRY : That 's what I was gonna say ! Leonardo ! You 're alive ? Here ? You 've learned my great secret . I was but a visitor to Earth . In truth , I am what you call a space alien . Oh ! It 's an honor to meet you , Leonardo . And may I say , you were great in Titanic . The Beach ... That 's Leonardo DiCaprio , you blockhead ! ( GROANS ) Looks like eating rocks wasn 't as dumb as you said . So what do people do for fun here ? Do you enjoy partying all night , with plenty of ale and lusty women ? - I sure do ! - Not us . We spend our leisure time in the mathematics museum . Planet Vinci is basically a single colossal university . How 's your football team ? Learned . Ooh ! I 'm going to check out that math lecture . All this knowledge is giving me a raging brainer . Would you like to hear the lecture , too , Fry ? No . It would just go in one ear and out some other hole . Come . Sit down . Now , that I can do . ( GROANS ) I have a terrible secret to confess , Mr. DiCaprio . I 'm not very smart . I appreciate your candor . I don 't even know what language you 're speaking . I , too , have a confession . You see , here on Planet Vinci , I am the stupidest person . What ? Who 'd possibly think you 're stupid ? Duh ! I 'm Leonardo ! I don 't know the mass of the Higgs boson . Duh ! I have to draw in pencil , 'cause I don 't know how to use rendering software . ( BOTH LAUGHING ) Stupid Biff ! Thinks he 's so smart . He looks stronger than you , too . I went to Earth because I could no longer stand the ridicule . But being surrounded by even stupider people was equally infuriating . I can see myself in your shiny button . Inventing is what makes me happy . Or did , until I misplaced the plans for my masterpiece . You mean these ? ( GASPS ) The machina magnifica ? Infinite joy ! Fry , my friend , you have given my life meaning again ! That calculus lecture was harder than I expected . We had to answer every question in the form of an opera . I have a lot of homework for tomorrow , if I don 't want to be embarrassed . ( INAUDIBLE ) ( ALL LAUGHING ) ( PLAYING RHYTHMICALLY ) ( ALL BOOING ) Thank you . Thank you . And if you like that , you 'll love our main event . Ladies and gentlemen , Leonardo DiCaprio ! ( ALL CHEERING ) I mean , da Vinci ! ( ALL BOOING ) For centuries , you 've ridiculed me . Especially you , Biff . Nice hat ! ( ALL WHOOPING ) But , at long last , this invention will show you . It will show you all ! Behold , my unstoppable doomsday machine ! And I helped ! Wait . You told me it was an unstoppable ice cream machine . Ice cream is just a by-product of the machine ! Lts primary purpose is to exterminate everyone who ever made me feel inferior ! Ooh ! I 'm so scared ! Bring it on , dum-dum ! ( ALL LAUGHING ) Oh , yeah ? Let 's see how hard you 're laughing when my doomsday machine chops off your face ! Leonardo , stop ! ( ALL GASP ) I want in on this ! Are you crazy , Professor ? I hate these nerds ! Just ' cause I 'm stupider than them , they think they 're smarter than me . Kill them all , starting with the math teacher ! ( ALL SCREAMING ) I knew this final invention would be a humdinger . Yes . We three idiots will finally have our revenge ! I don 't think so . You two make me ashamed to call myself an idiot . There 's always going to be someone smarter than you , so the only way to be happy is to make the most of what you 've got . - But you 've got nothing . - Oh , no ? I 've got one single nail , and another nail to nail it in with . And I 'm gonna stop this infernal ice cream machine once and for all ! ( SCREAMS ) ( ALL LAUGHING ) Some doomsday machine ! It barely killed anyone ! Oh , yeah ? Well , take this ! Oh , my . Poor Leonardo da Vinci . He sure was stupid . Fry , I admire what you did today , and I 'm deeply sorry for insulting your intellect . Your tiny , tiny intellect . Oops . There I go again , you dope . - I mean , dummy . - It 's okay . I may not be clever , but I have a good heart . - That 's what my mom used to say . - She was a wise woman . - Also , that I 'm not much to look at . - A wise woman , indeed . ENGLISH - US - SDH

 MOLLY : I went to space on a 13-month solo mission . I didn 't come home alone . My husband created a lifelike android called a Humanich . His name is Ethan . He 's the prototype . This is a story about Earth . Ethan . MOLLY : A story about family . A story about surviving . ANNOUNCER : Previously on Extant : MOLLY : He is not the same as when I left here . We have to go right now . - No ! - Ethan ! - He 's changed . - And so have you . That 's called life . MOLLY : Marcus . - What ? - See for yourself . Completely normal human fetus . - What did you do to me ? - I don 't know what you mean . Well , I 'm 14 weeks pregnant . And 14 weeks ago , I was in space . I put the family in the spaceship so that they 'd be safe . - Safe from what ? - Extinction . - Why didn 't you call me ? I was worried . - I just couldn 't , I 'm sorry . If you 're not ready to talk about what 's going on with you , that 's fine . - That why you haven 't told John ? - That I had a vision of my dead boyfriend , and I 'm pregnant with something I can 't explain ? Harmon is alive . He told me not to trust the ISEA or anybody . They 'll follow you , they 'll force you into quarantine . And if you tell anybody , nobody will believe you . Not even the people you love . But with Molly , there can be no doubt . You think we found them ? I think they 're already here . [ DOGS BARKING ] KERN : I tracked Dr. Barton 's car there with the surveillance drone . Sam Barton knows ? She knows there 's a baby . That must have come as something of a surprise . She was with Molly through all of her infertility courses at the Medical Center . All unsuccessful . She was pregnant once , but she lost it . It was a previous relationship . KERN : Who 's this ? SPARKS : Marcus Dawkins . They met in the Ascendants Program . There was an accident before he had a chance to go up . - That 's how she lost the baby ? - Mm . We have to contain this before she tells anybody else . I 'll take care of Molly . What are you gonna tell her ? Something more believable than the truth . [ MOLLY SIGHS ] I 'm sorry . For what ? Well , I feel like it 's my fault . No , no , Molly . Hey . Heh . It 's not . We 'll try again . I don 't know if I can . Then we 'll stop . Or we 'll wait . They 're making advancements in stem cells every day . There 's a lab in Lucerne that 's on the verge of creating an oocyte . I mean , maybe we can pull some strings and get in a trial . But that 's still experimental . Well , it 's a possibility . I don 't want possibilities anymore . I want something concrete . I want tangible . I don 't want to be disappointed . We 've been doing this for so long . Maybe we have to just face the facts that this isn 't for us . That we 're not meant to have a child together . Molly . [ SIGHS ] What if there 's another way ? I 've interviewed dozens of couples who wanna take him home for the beta testing phase . He 'd probably do well with any one of them . He 'd get the programming he needs by being a part of a family . But why shouldn 't it just be us ? We have more to give than anyone I know . And if we can 't give it to a child of our own , let 's give it to him . If he 's going to be programmed by a family experience , why not this family ? - Permanently ? - Yeah . Let 's keep him here as our son . Sweetheart , it doesn 't work like that . You can 't just plug and play a family . I know that . But , hey , what 's the saying ? Family is what you make it . If we give it time , a year , maybe two years ... I just signed up for the rotation on the Seraphim . - When ? - Today . After the doctor . [ SIGHS ] Oh . Um ... When will you know if you 're going up ? I don 't know . I might not go up . I mean , there 's other really qualified candidates , but ... Then , we can cross that bridge when we come to it . You don 't want possibilities , you want concrete , right ? Well , this is concrete . This is what we wanted . Morning . Morning . How long have you been awake ? Not long . I was thinking , we should take the morning off . No . - Got too much to do . We can 't . - No , I can handle it . Ethan 's orientation isn 't until 11 . I can get him ready , and then I can pick up the cake and the food for the party . I don 't need another party . I just had a party . No , no , no . That was a homecoming . This is your birthday . - This is not my birthday . - No , it 's not . But on your real birthday , you were millions of miles away with nobody to keep you company or sing to you . Well , not true . B.E.N sang to me . And how was that ? [ BOTH LAUGH ] No , really , come on . Let me make it up to you . Hmm ? All morning for yourself . No errands , no obligations . What 's the one thing you want to do the most ? Hmm . [ MOLLY LAUGHS ] Do I have to go ? It 's orientation day at your new school . It 's important . Will you stay with me ? Heh . You know I can 't do that . I won 't know anyone . Brynn 's going to be your senior guide . You 'll know her . By the end of the day , you 'll know a lot of other kids . Nothing to be worried about . Okay , I have to go pick up some stuff for the party tonight . Mom 's on her way back . Can I leave you with G.I.N.A. For a few minutes ? Yes . - Can I trust you to obey the rules ? - Yes . What are the rules ? Don 't go outside . Don 't answer the door . Good . If you have any problems , G.I.N.A. Can call me , okay ? [ INDIEPOP MUSIC PLAYING OVER HEADPHONES ] [ PANTING ] ELECTRONIC VOICE : You 've exceeded recommended heart rate . I encourage you to decelerate . - Negative . - Blood pressure rising . - Please decelerate . - Negative . - You appear to be under stress . - Affirmative . [ RUMBLING OVERHEAD ] [ PANTING ] You were right . I didn 't think there was a chance in hell that it could be true , but it is . What is ? There 's a covert program in the Medical Center . They 've been conducting experiments on astronauts , all off the books . For all I know , this is the tip of the iceberg . Why would they do that ? It was an experimental treatment to reverse your anovulation . Nanotech , set to time release . They picked you because you still had samples in storage from your infertility courses . So it 's ours ? Yours and John 's . - Well , why wouldn 't they just ask me ? - It was a blind test , Molly . Given your history , they didn 't want anything to impede the possibility of success . I 'll know more tomorrow . Right now , my primary concern is you . There 's something else going on . Your brain scans are identical to Harmon Kryger 's . Which makes me think you 're suffering the same hallucinations he did before he killed himself . I 'd feel a lot better if you 'd come in and get checked out . No , no , no . I just got home . I 'm not going into quarantine . I 'm not talking about quarantine . I 'm talking about a day or two in the hospital with somebody you trust , like Sam . John and Ethan can come whenever they want . You 're right . I was supposed to protect you , and I didn 't . And I intend to take full responsibility for that . This is going to end a lot of careers , including mine . But before I show myself to the door , I 'd like to do everything in my power to make this right . I got to go . I 'm out of here . Molly . Molly , I hope you 'll let me help . [ COOING ] [ PIGEON RATTLING ] DILLARD : Okay , everybody , you should have received a checklist for the orientation scavenger hunt in your pre-mailed packet . If you didn 't get one or you need a new one , please let your senior guide know . Mr. Perry ? Seniors , once you have your student , you can take them to their first session . And parents ? Hello , parents ? Pickup is outside the playground entrance at 3 : 30 . Thank you , everybody . Be good to Brynn , okay ? He 'll be good . If not , I 'll lock him in the dungeon . It 's illegal to put kids in dungeons . Then I 'd better not get caught . MOLLY : Here you go . There you are . And don 't forget the scavenger hunt . Go get them . DILLARD : Dr. Woods ? - Hello ? JOHN : Hi . I am so sorry . Um , some of the parents would like to ask you a few questions . Sure . I have been working with Dr. Woods on this for the last six months , and I can assure you , neither of us would do anything that puts any of your children in danger . I believe this was addressed in the pre-orientation packet . This was not in that . What is your concern ? I work with assembly bots over at the hangar , okay ? You know what happens on the floor . They put them in cages so people don 't get mauled . He 's not an assembly ... Ah . Look , we 've given them hundreds of tests over the years . Empathy tests , right and wrong decision trees . He has passed them all . He 's at a point right now where he needs the thousands of little interactions with his peers every week . Your kids will be an important part of his development . You haven 't answered the question . Is he dangerous ? No , he 's not . Heh . I don 't see what 's funny about this . - If you 're worried about a little kid ... ROB : No , that 's just it . He 's not a kid , he 's a toaster with hair . Okay , okay , okay . Yeah , he is a toaster to you . But to us , he 's our son . Now , I don 't expect you to understand that , and , honestly , I have a hard time with that myself sometimes . He 's not dangerous . He 's just different . And you don 't have to be afraid of different . [ GAME BLEEPING ] Your turn . Thank you , Julie . Nice . - Stop it . - Stop what ? Worrying . I 'm sure he 's fine . It 's not Ethan I 'm worried about . What , the other kids ? He 's gonna have to deal with them sooner or later . There 's no nature with Ethan . It 's all nurture . Kids his age are not nurturing . It 's the opposite . If you 're even the slightest bit different ... I hear you , Jules . But he can 't stay with us forever . He didn 't . John took care of that . - Oh , she 's good . - She 's up three-nothing . She isn 't just learning , she 's getting competitive . - How many rounds have you played ? - Six . - That 's faster than Little Man . - A lot faster . Nice job , Lucy . Shall we play another ? Sure . SAM : I know everybody who works in the Med Center , and they would never do something like that . Well , they said it was some kind of covert program . There 's too much oversight for a covert program . Takes me four rounds of requisition forms just to get new clipboards around here . But why would he lie ? It 's not like the guy is covering his ass . He practically resigned in my driveway . - So , what do you think he wants ? - Nothing . He just wants me to come in for some tests . He 's worried about my brain scans . Look , no one wants you to end up like Harmon Kryger . But still ... - What did John say ? - I haven 't told him . We had the orientation this morning , we have the party tonight ... Molly , you have to tell John . I 'm going to , tonight , after the party . But right now , I got to find Kryger . If they 've been testing on me , I 'm sure they 've tested on him . [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] Harmon ? Kryger ? G.I.N.A : Reminder . Ethan pickup at 3 : 30 . [ SIGHS ] [ CAMERA CLICKS ] [ DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES ] Dr. Woods . Heh . I hope I didn 't scare you . I recognized the car . I wanted to save myself a trip . This was recovered in the women 's room at work yesterday . Oh . I , uh ... I must 've dropped it before I left . That 's what I figured . Don 't worry , it 's been sterilized . Okay . Put it in whenever you get a chance . I know the director has some concerns about your health . He 'll rest easier once he knows your tether is back online for monitoring . - I 'm late to get my son , so ... - Of course . Again , I 'm sorry . I hope I didn 't frighten you . [ CAR DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES ] DILLARD : Walk , please . - I 'm sorry . DILLARD : We 're walking . Thank you . - Thanks . - See you tomorrow . MAN : I told you . Congratulations , your daughter made friends with the toaster . If Molly keeps digging around like this , she will raise suspicion . No , we will raise suspicion if we drag her out in the middle of the day . People ask questions . All right , what do you suggest ? I 've known her for a long time . If I can bring her in tonight quietly , of her own free will , we can get her to a secure spot with a medical team standing by . That will save us a lot of headache down the line . You 're a good friend . [ DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES ] [ MOLLY CHUCKLES ] Wow . You think ? Uh , wow . [ BOTH CHUCKLE ] For a successful first day of school , and the celebration of the birthday you missed . You really didn 't have to do all this . Just to see you in that dress , it was worth it . [ CHUCKLES ] Cheers . [ CHIME RINGS ] ELECTRONIC VOICE : John , Ethan 's requesting your help in his bedroom . Hmm . The bow tie . Good luck . JOHN : All right . Worst thing , best thing . What was the worst thing that happened to you at school today ? They had sloppy Joes for lunch . Okay . Best thing ? - I made a friend . - Oh , I saw that . She said her parents didn 't want me there . Uh , I think her parents were just a little bit concerned . About what ? Well , because you 're new . You know ? Sometimes people are afraid of new . - Why ? - Because new means change . You know , it 's nothing you should worry about . You should just keep doing what you 're doing , huh ? Be kind , be helpful , be trustworthy . Just like you were today . Ha . [ WE ARE TWIN 'S " THE WAY WE TOUCH " PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ] [ ALL CHATTERING ] Would you like something to drink ? CHARLIE : There you go . More stiff elbow , there . Charlie , stop it . - He says it 's the dance of my ancestors . - Yeah . Not cool . Heh-heh . [ DOORBELL RINGS ] - Hi . - Hi . Hey . There 's the schoolboy . - How 'd it go ? - It was fun . - Oh , good . Hi , John . - Hey . Welcome . Thank you . Hey , would you like to help me with something upstairs ? Sure . All right , I 'll see you later , okay ? Once I get this to the lab , the DNA test shouldn 't take long . I 'm gonna go there and then I 'm gonna come straight back . All right . The blue light means it 's ready to draw . - It 's gonna sting a bit . You ready ? - Yup , go . SAM : Okay . You 're doing great . That 's all I need . - You okay ? - Mm-hmm . - Are you sure ? - Yup . All right . In two hours , you will have all the answers that you need . - Oh , thank you . - Happy birthday . - Okay . - I 'll be back . [ SIGHS THEN GROANS ] [ GROANING ] It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . [ SIGHS ] [ GASPS ] [ DOORBELL RINGS ] [ UPBEAT POP MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ] - Hey , Mol . - Hey , look at you . CASS : I brought the dip . BILL : Nice . See how she treats me ? Tim ? [ LAUGHS ] - What are you doing here ? - Furlough . Six weeks . I ran into Bill downtown . He said you wouldn 't mind . Of course I don 't mind . - How 'd it go ? - At school ? A little bumpy at first , but it all worked out . What kind of bumpy ? Parents . Nothing to worry about . - I wish he didn 't have to go through that . - Well , I do too . But he needs school . We can 't keep giving him the same input , just you , me and Charlie . I don 't think the answer is school . We can 't control what he 's exposed to . I don 't want to control what he 's exposed to . He needs random input , not programmed learning . Yes , but if we push him too fast ... Julie , I understand your concern . I do . And you 're absolutely right . He may get some bad input from other kids . If he does , we 'll balance it out with the good . I don 't want anything to jeopardize our work or him . Julie , this is much more than my work now . It 's my family . Excuse me . MOLLY : Come on . - Wow . - John . Heh . So , hey , I lost track of you after you got on the boats . Where you been ? I sent a couple postcards . - What , eight years ago ? - Heh-heh . Eight years . Look , I hit a rough patch after Marcus died . And having that distance from everyone , I don 't know , but somehow it helped . - I think if anyone can understand that ... - I do . He was your brother . I am sorry . About what ? For not being there for you after the accident . Oh , Tim . Look , I know how hard it was for you after losing him and losing the baby . It was just so much for you to handle . I guess I just didn 't know where to start . Well , there wasn 't anything anybody could do . I just had to push through it , every day , all by myself . [ CHUCKLES ] Do you ever see him ? Marcus ? I do . All the time . I mean , I know it 's not really him . Just a stranger or someone on the street that looks like him . With those eyes . Those eyes , they 'd cut right through you . Used to hurt like a punch to the gut . Now I see it as him sending me a message . What kind of message ? That even though he 's dead , he 's always gonna be with us . One way or another . That we 'll be all right . Yeah . CHARLIE : Okay , listen up , we 're gonna do a group picture . So everyone come on over here . Get real close and centered and ... All right , squeeze in . All right . Big cheesy smiles , here we go . One , two , three . ALL : Smile . [ ALL GROAN ] Sorry . Hang tight , everyone . - Gonna get some candles . CASS : That 's the third one this month . JOHN : I 'll kick on the generator . What is ... ? [ SCRATCHING AND CLATTERING ] Did you do this ? ETHAN : Yes . - When ? - This morning . You went outside when you weren 't supposed to ? Why ? ETHAN : I was going to come back and play with it . This is exactly what I 'm talking about . You can 't do this kind of thing . I wasn 't going to hurt it . Well , it didn 't have any food or air . It could have died in here . - I 'm sorry . - You remember what I said about people being afraid of you ? You have to be more careful than other kids . You won 't have the same chances they do . Do you understand ? - Yes . - Good . No more breaking the rules , no more birds . And no more secrets . Mom said that secrets are okay if you don 't want someone to worry . She said that ? Does your mom have a secret ? [ ALL CHATTERING ] [ ALL CHEER ] MAN : All right . - Sorry . MAN : About time . Hey . What 's going on ? Are you keeping something from me ? [ SIGHS ] Ethan told me . Told you what ? That you were keeping a secret . You think we could talk about it after the party ? No , I don 't want to talk about this after the party . I think I 've waited long enough . So just please tell me . Okay . This is ... This is why he 's having problems . He 's lying , Molly . He 's disobeying me . And so this is my fault ? No , he just reflects what we give him . And we can 't get back on track if you don 't wanna tell me what 's going on with you . [ SIGHS ] You know what ? You can keep all the secrets you want . Please , just don 't involve our son . I 'm pregnant . Why would you say something like that ? Because it 's true . How is that even possible ? - The ISEA did it . - What ? Sparks said they implanted something inside of my body . They took our samples with some kind of time-release system and then they did all this without my consent . - When 'd you find out ? - When I got home . You 've been dealing with all of this since you got home ? Molly . Hey . - I didn 't tell you because I was scared . - Of what ? That you wouldn 't believe me . Of course I believe you . Why wouldn 't I believe you ? Are you okay ? No . [ SIGHS ] We 'll get through this , okay ? Okay . [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] CHARLIE : John ? We 're waiting for you guys for the video . [ UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING ON VIDEO ] Ethan and I , we felt bad that you were gonna miss a lot while you were in space this year , so we came up with an idea . I came up with an idea . [ ALL LAUGH ] You 're not gonna miss a thing . Hey , Molly . So I just got out of the DMV , and guess what , I 'm licensed . [ ALL LAUGH ] WOMAN 2 : Molly , whatever you do , please stay in outer space , okay ? It 's really not safe down here . WOMAN 1 : I 'm a good driver . Don 't listen to her . I 'm great . Hey . Why aren 't you downstairs watching the video ? Your room is looking pretty cool these days . You still have it . - It 's the one that you gave to me . - Yeah . Long before you ever got your body . At night , your dad would go home and I would stick around and I would sit in front of the screen and I would turn out all the lights except one . Then I 'd read it to you . We must have read this book 200 times . Didn 't you get bored ? No . I could never get bored with this book . In fact , I 'd read it right now if , you know , someone asked me to . Will you read it to me ? Well ... - Okay . - Hold on . Now I 'm ready . Okay . Ready ? " There was once a velveteen rabbit , and in the beginning , he was really splendid . " - What 's going on ? - They 've got the whole wing sealed off . - Some kind of chemical leak . - Chemical leak ? Yeah , they 've got the Hazmats and the whole nine yards . - Well , I just have to get into my office . - Uh , it 's probably gonna be a while . Sorry , Dr. Barton . Okay . You 're coming home tomorrow . It 's been excruciating at times , for various reasons , but , uh , you 're always worth the wait . I love you . Come back . Fast . Quickly . Now . [ ALL CHEER ] Well , you guys know I 'm not really good at giving speeches . I spend most of my time talking to computers and dead worms . ALL : Ha-ha-ha ! MOLLY : So ... But I have to say , after 13 months in space , I have realized what 's really most important in life . And I 'm looking at it right now . It 's friends . It 's family . And , well , it 's all of you , so ... Thank you for being here . Thank you for doing this . Really . And , uh , now , it 's time for you to get the hell out of my house . [ ALL LAUGH ] No , just kidding . Stay around . Drink , eat . Have fun . Thank you . Where 's Tim ? I wanna say goodbye before he goes . - Tim ? - Yeah , Marcus ' brother . Tim , who used to work on the boats ? That Tim ? - Yeah . He 's here . - No , he 's not . Yeah , he is . He came with Bill . Tim . - No , Molly , Molly , he 's not here . - I just saw him . He 's here . Tim . Tim ? - Tim . - He 's not here . Yeah , he is here . He 's right ... ALL : Smile . Quarantine ? Not after what they did to you . Whatever 's going on in my brain is getting worse and fast . - Okay , but I 'll take you somewhere else . - Where else am I gonna go ? Anywhere but not with him . - Sparks has nothing to do with this . - You believe that ? Well , I have no reason not to . And Sam is gonna be there and I trust her . Hey , hey . How long has this been going on ? Since I was on the Seraphim . Before I came home . - I saw somebody . - Who ? - Marcus . - And Tim ? Tim is a whole other story . I spent the whole night talking to him . I saw other people talking to him . I can 't keep going on like this , John . Something is happening to me . It was a lot easier when I only had to worry about one crew at a time . Make sure everyone was safe . Make sure they all got back alive . Now I 've got 20 different missions going , teams rotating in and out . I thought I had a handle on it , but after my daughter died up there , after Katie died , I was probably due a career change . I just didn 't see it ending like this . How much longer is this gonna take ? Let me see if I can get an answer for you . I have Dr. Barton here , wondering when she can get in her office . Please advise . Someone will be here in a minute . Tell them I 'll come back later . MAN : Dr. Barton 's computer goes to the lab . All files on Molly Woods , everything . G.I.N.A : Molly , you have a call from Dr. Barton . - Sam ? SAM : Where 's Molly ? She 's on her way to see you at the Med Center . - Who 'd she go with ? - Director Sparks . [ LINE DISCONNECTS ] - Sam ? G.I.N.A : Call ended . Dr. Barton . Yes ? Where are you taking me ? Molly , you 're going to be fine . You just have to trust me .

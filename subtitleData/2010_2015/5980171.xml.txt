 MOLLY : I went to space on a 13-month solo mission . I didn 't come home alone . My husband created a lifelike android called a Humanich . His name is Ethan . He 's the prototype . This is a story about Earth . Ethan ! MOLLY : A story about family . A story about surviving . ANNOUNCER : Previously on Extant : You were right . They 've been conducting experiments on astronauts . All off the books . - I 'm pregnant . - How 's that even possible ? SAM : Once I get this to the lab , the DNA test won 't take long . That 's all I need . MOLLY : I was talking to Tim earlier . JOHN : Tim who ? Dawkins . Marcus ' brother . JOHN : Tim ? MOLLY : He 's out there at the party . JOHN : No , he isn 't . I can 't keep going on like this , John . I gotta go get some help . Whatever is going on in my brain is getting worse , and fast . MAN : Dr. Barton . [ PHONE CHIMES ] - Pull over . SPARKS : I can 't do that . Pull over ! [ TIRES SCREECHING ] [ AGENTS SHOUTING ] AGENT : They 're gone . MOLLY We should have dropped Ethan off with Julie . We 're a family . We go together . I don 't like this . Well , we can 't stay here . Where was Sparks taking you ? Quarantine . Sam said get out of the car , so ... But if this baby is ours , then why would he take you to quarantine ? What 's he trying to cover up ? People were gonna lose their careers over it . And maybe he was trying to save his own . I deactivated Ethan 's tracking , just in case if they try to use him to get to us . But we can 't hide forever . They will find us . I just need one day . I 'm gonna do the DNA test myself and then we can go home . Here . Right here . [ AGENTS CHATTERING ] KERN : Sir . - Yes ? The vehicle 's abandoned in a parking lot . We 're scanning footage from aerial drones to determine where they went . Probably not far . Their passports are upstairs . Didn 't access their bank accounts . They left in a hurry . What kind of priority are we talking about here , sir ? I 'll have to get back to you on that . [ DEVICE CHIMES ] ELECTRONIC VOICE : Phone call from Director Sparks . Where would you like to take it ? Private , please . Yes ? We have a bit of a situation with Molly Woods . She resisted my attempts to bring her into quarantine . Where is she now ? We 're tracking her down . - We 'll find her . - You don 't sound optimistic . I gave her every chance , but we are where we are . Yes , you gave her the opportunity to come in willingly , and now we must try another approach . Given , as you say , we are where we are . I understand . [ IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] [ ELEVATOR WHIRS ] [ ELEVATOR DINGS THEN DOORS OPEN ] Mr. Yasumoto , welcome . Thank you for accommodating me on such short notice . It 's our pleasure . I 'd be happy to show you our latest development . No , no , please , allow me . Ten years , and we have come so close in replicating the meteor substance . - Have you minimized the danger ? - To a degree . Of course , there are still improvements to be made . While we 've eliminated damage on contact with the skin , we haven 't completely ruled out any risk to the respiratory system . Excellent . As you can see , we are on the path to being fully operational . And the healing properties ? We 've had encouraging results . YASUMOTO : I see . Would he mind taking off his mask ? We are not prepared for that level of exposure . You mentioned that you minimized the danger . It 's true . But not without consequences . I 'd like to witness the progress myself . It is , of course , your choice . [ IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] [ INHALES DEEPLY ] There . Good . Progress has been made . - What 's happening now ? - Anton . Anton . Anton . Anton . Anton . Anton . Anton . Anton . Anton . [ ALARM WAILING ] Wow ! Look what the tide dragged in . Heh ! Come here . [ BOTH SIGH ] - Hi , Daddy . - Hey , baby girl . Thousands of miles up to the heavens and then back here again . Phew ! Still just as beautiful as ever . JOHN : Hello , Quinn . John . Whoa , wow ! It 's the admiral of the 7th Fleet , no doubt . Hi , Grandpa . Hey , look , I took the liberty of providing transportation for you . - You know how to drive yet ? - I 'm not allowed to . Oh , what a travesty . I 'll tell you what , you can ride stowaway in the back . How about that , huh ? [ LAUGHS ] You don 't plan to stay long , do you ? It 's a bit of an impromptu visit . Just for a day . - We 'll be back soon . - Yeah ? That 's what I said 40 years ago . Your mother , she dreamed of living in Paris . When I told her I was gonna set up my practice here , they used to call this the Paris of the Pacific . Of the Pacific , I know . Heh-heh . You 've heard that before , haven 't you ? We just had a really long trip , Daddy , so can we just get to the house ? Sure . Just for a day . [ MOLLY SIGHS ] Hello ? Anybody ? [ DOOR BEEPS THEN UNLOCKS ] - Yes ? - Look , I know . I entered an off-limits area . I blew it . I expect to be disciplined , but I 'd really like to go home now . Director Sparks requested that you wait . - He should be here any minute . - Uh ... Can I at least go to the bathroom ? I 've been - pfft . SPARKS : We 've detained Sam Barton . She tried to destroy a sample of Molly 's blood . I 'm fairly certain Molly told her about the pregnancy . And the blood sample ? If I had to guess , she 's trying to determine the DNA of the baby . It 's critical that she not get the answers she seeks . - I understand . - I 'm not sure you do . My experiments at recreating the life-sustaining substance have failed . Time is running out . The answer may be in what Molly brought back inside her . I can 't unring the bell . Now that she 's asking questions , she won 't stop until she gets an answer . Then it 's time we take her out of the equation . She 's done her part . She brought the baby here . We can take care of the rest . There 's the issue of Sam Barton . She 'll need to be taken care of too . I 'm confident you 'll find a way . [ BARKING ] MOLLY : Gus , here , boy . [ MOLLY WHISTLES ] ETHAN : Here , boy , come on . MOLLY : Gus . Gussy . [ GUS GROWLING AND BARKING ] QUINN : Oh , hush , that 's just Molly . - What 's going on , boy ? QUINN : Gus ! - Aah ! - Hey , what the hell you doing ? Get out of there . Move . - He bit me . - Oh , come here . - Look . - Aah . Now let 's get in the kitchen , have a look . Come on , let 's go . I 've never seen Gus act like that . - Put that on the bite . MOLLY : Okay . - Thanks . - Yeah . I don 't know what came over that dog . Well , I haven 't been here in a long time . Six years . I get to see you guys on a visit to mainland , but it 's not the same . This is home . People ask about you a lot . You 've made quite a name for yourself , young lady . Here we go . Uh , so John and I would like to go through some of my old science equipment . We think Ethan would like to play with it . Aah . Oof . - Is that your story ? - What 's that supposed to mean ? The first time in six years you come marching in here with just a single duffle bag for all of you ? How are your meetings going , Daddy ? Oh , good . You answer a question with a question . Heh-heh . Good work . You still didn 't answer my question . I don 't need the meetings anymore . I had a few slips . But I have it under control . I have not had a drink in a couple of years . Yeah , of course , it 'll take a couple more before you 'll give me a chance , huh ? [ CHUCKLES ] How 's the patient ? I 'm better . ETHAN : This place is cool . Wait till you see your room . - I have a room ? - You do now . - Used to be mine . Want to see it ? - Sure . Come on . It 's up there . Aerial drone footage tracked them to the docks . John Woods chartered a boat there this morning . Vaspar Island . Her father has a house there . - You have a team on standby ? - We 're moving out on your word . Go . But keep your distance until I call . - How 's this going ? - Oh , she 's tough , but everyone has their limits . ETHAN : Ursa Minor . Ursa Major . - Pisces ? MOLLY : Mm-hmm . Keep going . Andromeda . Aries . - Taurus . - That 's where the seven sisters live . Have you heard that story ? No . Okay , well , one day , the seven sisters were playing in a meadow . And a hunter named Orion came upon them . He fell in love with them , and wanted to catch them , but they ran away . Their dad complained about Orion , so Zeus turned the sisters into doves , and scattered them throughout the sky . And that 's where they live , as stars . He 's still chasing them . Every night . My mother told me that story . Heh . Do you remember her name ? Maia . That was the name of the oldest of the sisters . That 's probably why she liked the story so much . Does it make you sad when you think about her ? Sometimes . But when I 'm having a bad day , I just look up there , and I see her face . - I don 't see a face . - Well , keep looking . You never know what you might see . I 'm gonna go help your dad . QUINN : You start school yet ? - I only went one day . - Ah . Make any friends ? - A girl . - Ah . Of course you did . Yeah , chip off the old block . Heh-heh-heh . Oh , boy . Looky here . You want to see something cool ? [ QUINN HUMMING ] Pop . [ QUINN CHUCKLES ] - Can I try ? - Of course . So first thing , let 's find a suitable specimen . Ah ! Now , the key is to throw it so it skips over the top of the water , kind of like with a sidearm action , huh ? Like this : Wow ! Okay ? Here , you try . No , no , don 't be so hard on yourself . Takes years of practice . Nice toss . The kid 's got an arm on him . I 'll say he has . Heh . Let 's go home . Your mom 's waiting for you . Heh-heh . Come on . You ever think about playing football or baseball or something ? - Hey . - Hey . Your old DNA isolator is still here . - Oh , please tell me it still works . - No . But I can gut some of this junk , Jerry-rig a fix . - How long ? - Uh , an hour or two , tops . Everything else we need is right here in this bag . So when we do the test , and it 's ours , what 's next ? We have the baby . We have the baby ? Yeah . You look happy . So do you . [ CHUCKLES ] It 's just , I could never have guessed that it would happen this way . I didn 't think it would happen at all . ETHAN : What are you guys doing ? Um , hey . Wanna tear apart an old DNA isolator ? Sure . [ DOOR CLOSES ] [ SIGHS ] Mm . [ SIGHS ] Ethan seemed to like the beach . It 's hard to know what Ethan likes . Look , I didn 't come here to fight with you , Daddy . Okay . I can see that you 're trying . I 'm trying too . Well , it seems I 'm a much better grandparent than ... Than I am a parent . Do you think you could do me a favor ? Okay . And take Ethan into town for some supper tonight ? Sure . Any special reason ? Um , well ... John and I could really use a few hours to ourselves . It 's been a crazy couple of weeks since my reentry . Okay . Um , any special instructions ? No . Just , um , bring him back before bedtime . I can do that . Well , if we 're gonna hit to town , I 'd better go change clothes . [ BOTH CHUCKLE ] [ DRILL WHIRRING ] Team 's in place . They 're awaiting your signal . Thank you . I wish I could get in your head . Concealing Molly 's pregnancy , destroying her blood sample . How exactly was that in her best interest ? You implanted an embryo without her consent . Don 't talk to me about her best interest . At 11 : 34 p.m. , you sent her a text : " Get out of the car . " What exactly do you think is going on here ? Oh , I think you 're covering your own ass . Well , maybe it 's time you did the same . Where is Molly ? What did you do to her ? You haven 't the faintest idea what you 've put in motion with your little stunt . I was trying to help her . And now I 'm gonna try to help you . Help me how ? How long have you worked here , Sam ? Are you threatening me ? Because let 's face it , Alan , you don 't have a leg to stand on . As soon as this goes public ... All right , I 'll answer my own question . Fifteen years , right ? From med school straight into the academy . Top of your class . I was always impressed . I 'm not saying another word until you let me see Molly . You 'll probably wanna talk . Eventually . It seems like you 've been hiding a lot lately . Your brother , you did an exemplary job of covering up his past . Erased his old identity and manufactured a new one . You don 't know what you 're talking about . I mean , what could he have done that was so unforgivable that you had to go to such great lengths ? - Alan ... - Then I heard a very compelling story about a 19-year-old boy , a suspect in the shooting death of an unarmed man , his roommate , 10 years ago . And the strange part was , before the boy could stand trial , strings were pulled . He was transferred to a minimum security mental facility on the advice of a well-respected physician . - Don 't do this . - The judge was never informed that the physician was related to the boy . His sister , in fact . Billy didn 't know what he was doing . He is stable now , he 's on the right medication . He 's not gonna hurt anybody . Let 's hope not . But he 's in a very fragile stage in his recovery , vulnerable to all kinds of dangers . Pitfalls seen and unseen . What are you planning to do to him ? Alan , please , just leave my brother out of this . This is a situation of your own making , Sam . And one that only you have the power to change . All you have to do is help Molly . What do you want me to do ? Right now , just enjoy your chat . The rest , we 'll talk about later . Sammy . [ DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES ] - It 's Billy . - Hey . Hi . Hi . You look great . I have a status update . Is the team in place ? We 're waiting on your word . - Consider this the go . - What about Sam Barton ? I don 't think she 'll be an issue for us anymore . And , Gordon , I assume you 'll take every precaution to keep this as seamless as possible . I 'll call you when we 're done . We 're a go . Ethan , would you be honest with me if I asked you a question ? - Yes . - Did anything happen at home that made you leave the house all of a sudden ? - We had a party for my mom . - What kind of party ? A late birthday party . For when she was in space . - They have secrets . - Who ? My mom and dad . I hear them arguing , but then when they see me , they stop talking and act funny . What do they argue about ? I don 't know . That 's okay . Everybody 's got secrets . Even the best of them , huh ? Nobody 's perfect . GRIGGS : Hey , Quinnsy . - Hey , Griggsy . - Who do you got there ? - Griggsy , that 's my grandson , Ethan . Ethan , this is Mr. Griggs . Pleasure . - I take it Mol 's on the island . - Just for a short while . A couple of squid crews rolled in to the Anchor . Just screaming to take their money away . - Feeling lucky ? - Look , I promised Ethan 's mother that I 'd bring him home for bedtime . Well , another time . See you , kid . Hey , Ethan , how about we kill a half hour ? Hmm ? Nice . Angle it , angle it . Okay , now push it in . Yeah . [ MAN BREATHING HEAVILY ] Molly ? Don 't let me go . JOHN : What 's wrong ? He was here . Marcus . It 's a hallucination . Like Tim . - You don 't believe me ? - I believe you 're seeing things . But you can 't believe what you can 't see , right ? I want it to stop , okay ? So let 's get this test done . Then we 'll go home and get you the help you need . All right , son . Any time you 're ready . [ ALL CHEERING ] That 's my boy . MAN 1 : My wife is gonna kill me . All right , now , for the brave of heart , time for a final wager : Three in a row . Come on , come on . MAN 1 : Good luck , Quinnsy . This time , it 's gonna be double or nothing . [ ALL CHATTERING ] All right . All right , kid . Show them your magic now , okay ? MAN 2 : No way , kid . Come on , Ethan . We 're waiting . [ CHEERING AND SHOUTING ] Son of a bitch . Come on . Let 's go . MAN 2 : Come on . Come on back . Get in . Hurry up . That was real money , kid . Lots of it . What the hell happened ? - Sorry . - Sorry ? Yeah , sorry don 't cut it . Sorry don 't give me my money back ! Take a whole bunch of sorry , and it adds up to nothing . You ever think about that when you were screwing up ? - No . - Of course you wouldn 't . Why would you ? You have no regard for anybody else having a good time . Nobody 's perfect . Oh , no . Are you kidding me ? Is that why you missed ? Because of what I said ? Oh , that 's not what I meant , kid . That 's not what ... Yeah , I left that gate open for a reason . I think your mom and dad ... Kid ? Ethan ? Ethan ! [ ETHAN GRUNTING ] What do you mean , you lost him ? Well , we were driving back from town . I stopped to open up the gate , - and the kid was gone . - Gone how ? Well , I went to open up the gate . - Which you shut . - I didn 't shut it . And then when I went back , the kid had run off . I can 't reactivate his sensor . Something 's wrong . It could be these woods . The reception is bad . Okay , look , Daddy , Ethan wouldn 't just get out the car and run off . - What did you do to him ? - Nothing . - Daddy ! - Well , I ... I might 've snapped at him back in town . You did what ? Hey , hey , well , I thought that the kid was not gonna be reacting like that . - He 's a robot . - What happened ? Well , we all went to the Anchor Bar , you know , to toss a few rings for the guys . And was doing fine until he tanked the last toss . You used Ethan in a bar game ? Have you been drinking ? Well , I just had a little pop . - Oh ! - Wait , wait , wait a minute . Did it ever occur to you that maybe your son ran away because of you ? Don 't you think he knows what 's going on here ? All these secrets and lies ? - What trouble are you in ? - What are you talking about ? All these secrets and lies . You 're both acting like a bunch of fugitives ! And don 't you pretend that it 's my fault . You are running away from something and you 're not admitting it . Coming from the expert . All right , that 's enough . We need to contact the sheriff . Is there a local search and rescue out here ? - Yeah . - Okay . Call them . Until they get here , we 'll search for Ethan . We go separate directions . Your dad stays here , in case he wanders back . He 's smart . He won 't stay out long . - Okay ? - Okay ... Wait , John . What if it 's Sparks ? We have to stick with what we know . Ethan was yelled at . He 's programmed to react as a human . So he just probably ran off . He 's in these woods - waiting for us to come get him . - Right . Okay . JOHN : Ethan ! MOLLY : Ethan ! [ ETHAN GRUNTING ] [ DEVICE POWERING UP ] Mom ! Clear . Fire in the hole . [ GROANING ] SHERIFF : Did you see the direction he ran ? It 's somewhere in this direction . My back was turned for a minute . We 'll need a piece of his clothes so dogs can track his scent . We don 't need dogs . There 's enough of us . We can search . - Any word from Molly ? - No , not at all . Then we need to get your men out there . Just hold on . That 's dangerous terrain . I got 400-foot cliff banks straight down to the water , so it 's gonna be a hell of a lot easier to find your son if the dogs could track his scent . - Well , I 'm afraid that 's not possible . SHERIFF : Why not ? - Because he doesn 't have a scent . - Come again ? - He 's a ... He 's a Humanich . SHERIFF : A what ? A robot . He 's built to look like us . I know exactly what you mean . I read all about those things . We 're done here . Sorry , doc , but I 'm not risking my men and dogs to track down a machine . - We can find him when the sun rises . - But that 's hours from now . - Where do you think you 're going ? - To find my son . My wife is looking for him . If you won 't help me ... We can fan out and go in four directions . Doc ? Stay out of this . [ QUINN GROANS ] It 's not like the thing is gonna starve to death or freeze . Please . Please , he can be in real danger . Of what ? Rust ? [ GRUNTS ] [ OFFICERS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ] Ethan ! Ethan ! Ethan . Ethan . Ethan ! Ethan ! Ethan . Ethan , talk to me . Ethan . Come on , baby . Come on . Unh . [ HELICOPTER WHIRRING OVERHEAD ] Oh , come on . This is ridiculous . We can 't stay here . You hit a cop . What did you expect , a La Quinta ? You 're here till morning . Can I at least have my phone so I can call my wife ? Yeah . I 'll ask the sheriff . I 'm sure he 's in a giving mood . - John ... - Please , Quinn , not now . Molly will find him . [ ALL CHATTERING ] [ DOOR CLOSES ] [ CRASH IN DISTANCE ] [ SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ] [ GRUNTS ] [ PANTING ] [ ALL CHATTERING ] [ BEEPING SOFTLY ] Island 's been cleared of all personnel . Anything else ? No , Gordon . We 're done here . [ CHUCKLES ] That 's funny . What 's that ? Feels more like we 're just starting . I 'll see you back on the mainland . [ ALL CHATTERING ] [ MACHINERY WHIRRING ] MAN : Increase the spore index . [ GAS HISSING ]

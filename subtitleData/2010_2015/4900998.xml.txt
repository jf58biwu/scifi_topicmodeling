 Previously on Touch : - I just found Ruben and the girl he was with dead in the control room . - Dead ? Their throats were slit . God will allow humankind to exist as along at there are 36 righteous people in the world . These hidden 36 , no one knows who they are . Aster Corps is one of the most powerful corporations in the world , and I think they 'll stop at nothing to destroy anyone who gets in their way . Obviously , this has something to do with Teller . There was another lab , years earlier . So they took Amelia back to where it began . I hope you find her . I shouldn 't even have to be looking for her . - She 's in there ? - Yeah . Amelia ? Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Aster Corps is gonna use that time and all of their resources to try and find you and your daughter . I want you to disappear . Give this to your dad . He 'll know what to do . Oh , my God . Run ! Run as fast as you can , okay ? ! Run ! Where 's the girl ? Physicists will tell you that time does not exist , that it is a human construct used to organize experience and catalog existence so we can quantify it , confirm it , remember it . Einstein did not believe in time . He believed in timelessness ; that all of time existed at once : Past , present , future . He did not acknowledge the concept of " now . " All moments are equally real and equally accessible , if we know how . Nothing . Hey , buddy . You hungry ? I got your cereal out . We got a lot to do today . Jake , I know you want me to find this man . I just don 't have a lot to go on . I 'll do the best I can , okay ? Oh , my God . Avram , what are you doing here ? I came to see you , Martin Bohm , and my good friend . - Please , come in . - Thank you . Hello , Jake . How are you ? Avram , please , sit . You are both well , I hope . A lot of terrible things have happened over the last few days . We managed to get Amelia back with her mother . And Jake and I are fine . I know about the killings at your workplace . And I know that the man that I met in New York , Guillermo Ortiz , committed those murders . You were right . He was coming after Jake . Yes . I came here to help you keep him safe . I can use all the help I can get . Thank you . Where is Amelia and her mother ? I asked Lucy to take her daughter and disappear for a while . Hide , spend some time with her . They 'll be back soon enough . " 948 . " What is it ? Jake gave this to me . It 's a man he wants me to find . It looks like he was Dr. Teller 's first patient . I don 't have anything other than that . Why are you still sitting here ? Go find him . I was waiting for Jake to wake up . Breakwire has some facial recognition software . I think they might be able to help . He 's awake . I 'm here . Go . It 's good to see you , Avram . Thank you . I 'll see you soon . Trevor ? Where is everybody ? Martin ... They 're gone . And the few who agreed to keep working are the handling funeral arrangements for those that we lost . I 'm just trying to keep everything afloat using my cell phone . I can 't let this place die , Martin . Trevor , I 'm so sorry . How can I help ? I 'll do anything . Look , I have a breaking story . Fill me in . Phillip Green . California 's decided to execute the first death row inmate in seven years . A triple murderer , tried and convicted 15 years ago . He 's set to die tonight . Oh , my God . What ? What is it ? Is this the man they 're gonna execute ? Yeah , that 's Phillip Green . Jake gave that to me yesterday . Asked me to find that man . Phillip Green . Touch S02E09 Clockwork Okay , we got three murders committed during a robbery . He worked at an antique shop . He went back after hours to clean the place out , and he saw the passersby , and he gunned them down in cold blood . Any witnesses to the murders ? Nope . Any chance he 's innocent ? He 's been appealing for ten years . I 'm gonna need to talk to him . Green 's not talking , but if you 're officially covering the story for Breakwire , I could get you in to see his attorney for a few minutes . He 's camped out at the prison , giving interviews , hoping the press will pressure the Governor into stopping the execution . Okay , set it up . I 'll take care of it from here . You get back to work with your people . Sounds good . Hey , Max , come here , buddy . I need you . I 'm the amazing Max and you 're super dad , and we can fly . That 's fantastic . Fly on over here , buddy . I need to see ... If I need to drill more holes or if you can reach all this or not . I can 't reach that . Oh , you can reach that . Come on . You 're amazing , remember ? All right , go fly . Fly away . - Mike ? - Yeah ? It 's for you . Thanks . Hello . Yeah , we 're still on . Yeah , I 'll be ready . Right . So you 're gonna go through with it ? - Honey , I have to go through with this . - No , you don 't . - I have to , Jenny , you don 't understand this . - Please . - Please , just don 't do this right now . - Mike , this isn 't who you are . This isn 't who we are . It 's not something I can just explain to you . - This is something I need to do , okay ? - Ow ! My finger ! Sweetie , let me see . What happened ? - It hurts ! - Let me see . I 'm sure it 's not that bad , buddy . Oh , it 's just a splinter , sweetie . It 's okay . We can get it out . Let 's go get the tweezers . Come on . Careful . Oh , careful . Hop down . Can you take this , please ? Thank you . Martin Bishop from Breakwire . Ben Miller , attorney for Phillip Green . I see you made it through the gauntlet of ghouls and looky-loos . Thank you for moving me up to the front . Look , I 'm in need of legitimate press to get the Governor 's attention . So , let 's just get started . Actually , I need to see your client . - He doesn 't do interviews . - It 's not exactly an interview . Look , I want to help him , okay ? But I need to speak with him first . Green has not spoken a word since the night he was arrested over a decade ago . So you talking to him isn 't gonna do you any good . I think it will . I was sent here because ... Wait . Sent here by who ? My son . And we 're done . Please , I 'm not crazy . Just hear me out . I don 't have time to waste on the visions and the voices in your head , okay ? I am trying to save a man 's life ! I know about the Teller Institute . I 've been to the facility where your client was being held . I know they conducted experiments on him , and I 'm pretty certain I know why . None of that ever made it into evidence . I 'm not surprised . Aster Corps has a way of manipulating the legal system to their advantage . Aster Corps ? The company that built the facility . The same company that funded Dr. Teller 's research . Look , I think something went terribly , terribly wrong out there . And I think all of this is Aster Corps ' effort to cover it up . I know this sounds crazy , but I was sent here to help your client . And I think Mr. Green will know that if you just let me see him . Please . Please , what have you got to lose ? King pawn to e-four . Very shrewd , Jake Bohm , very shrewd indeed . You see what I did there ? I chose to pressure your queen pawn , which I am certain that you will recognize as the French defense . I , too , can be shrewd . Your move , my boy . The clock ? What of it ? Are we late for something ? What are you doing , my boy ? Thank you . Mr. Green , my name is Martin Bishop . I-I want to try and help you . I know about the institute that you were held at , the Teller Institute . My son worked with Dr. Teller before he died . Were you aware that Dr. Teller had died ? My son sees things in numbers and patterns and makes human connections that the rest of us can 't , and I think you can see things , too . Mr. Green , are you one of the 36 ? My son sent me here to help you . I don 't know how yet . Am I supposed to help find evidence to prove your innocence ? Or maybe you want to tell me about something that happened at the institute that allowed all of this to happen . I-I just need you to know that I 'm here to help , and if there 's anything that you need , I will do it . Who is this ? Who is this ? That 's his daughter . They 've been estranged since he was convicted . Do you know where she is ? I have an address . She had to sign some papers a while back , but she doesn 't want to have any contact . She even changed her name . Mr. Green , is this what you want me to do ? Do you want me to bring your daughter here ? Okay . Then that 's where we 'll start . Can I help you ? I 'm looking for Dr. Kate Gordon . That 's me . Hi , I 'm Martin Bishop . I really need to talk with you , but it 's kind of personal . Well , I 've got about ten minutes before my next client . That would be great . - Come on in . - Thank you . You work with children ? Yeah , I 'm a family therapist , but I specialize in early childhood trauma . Behavioral issues , children who are disturbed , nonverbal . Really ? My son 's nonverbal . Is that why you 're here ? Not exactly . I 'm here because I want to talk to you about your father . What ? - Please leave . - Look , please . I don 't want to upset you , but I just came from the prison . I was visiting with your father . Obviously , I didn 't get to talk to him , but ... he showed me this photo of you when you were 14 years old . He was holding onto it for dear life , like it was the most important thing in the world . I just thought you should know that he would really like to see you . No . Look , I don 't know how much you know about him , but I believe he 's part of a very special group of people . My son is one of them . They can see things in patterns and numbers . But you already know that , don 't you ? My father had a gift for interpreting numbers and symbols . He could see a foreign language , an ancient language , and he could translate it , decode it , just by looking at the patterns of the letters and symbols . He was taken away to a research facility to be studied . That would be the Teller Institute . He was gone for months , and when he returned , he robbed a store and he killed three people . You see , I think there 's more to that story . Like what ? I think something happened to your father at the institute . I-I think he might even be innocent , and I think you 're the key to proving that . My father is guilty . When he was arrested , I asked him , " did you kill those people ? " And he said yes . I asked him why . I pleaded with him to explain it to me . This was not the father that I knew , but he never said another word . Not to me , not to anyone . He went off to jail , left me in the care of an aunt that I barely knew . He refused to let me visit him . Do you have any idea how many times I was turned away from that prison ? No . No , if he had a reason for doing what he did , I would be happy to hear it , but otherwise , please leave . And do not contact me again . I-I 'm sorry to have bothered you . Clock making has been around since the early 1300s . In fact , early clock makers were considered master craftsmen . I trust you plan on putting this back together again , young Jake , or we shall have to retain the services of just such a craftsperson . That was a joke . One , two , three , four , five , six gears in six piles . That 's 36 , my boy . Very interesting number . Very interesting , indeed . Hello . Avram , it 's Martin . I was just calling in to check on Jake . How 's he doing ? He 's fine . He 's fascinated by your wall clock , and I 'm fascinated by him . Did you find the man you were looking for ? Yes , and I think he 's one of the 36 . Is that right ? He 's also on death row . He 's gonna be executed tonight unless I can stop it . And how will you ? I 'm not sure yet . His daughter seems to be the key , but right now she doesn 't want to have anything to do with him . Yes , yes , disappointment can-can look much like hatred . - Does she believe that he is innocent ? - No , not at all . Then you will have to convince her that he is worth saving . Maybe then she 'll use whatever key she has to do just that . Martin , if this man is really one of the 36 , then you must save him . I know . I 'll check back with you in a while . Hey . How 's the finger ? Nothing a band-aid and some cartoons couldn 't fix . Oh , thanks . I made a decision , Jenny . I know that you think that doing this is gonna make you feel better , but it won 't . And it won 't bring your father back . Balance the scales a little , maybe get some justice . No , it 'll change you . It 'll change us . We have come so far since we lost your father . We didn 't lose him . He was murdered for a car , you know ? A car our son was sitting in when his grandfather was shot right in front of him . And the guy who did this , who traumatized our boy , traumatized our boy , killed my dad , he 's out there . You know , he 's just out there . - He 's walking free ; He 's living his life , honey . - We can 't focus on him . - He 's living his life . I can 't focus on anything else . - We can 't focus on him . That 's it . At least tonight , somebody 's gonna pay for it . Oh , you can 't even see how wrong that is . That man had nothing to do with your father 's death . He killed someone , didn 't he ? Yeah . Think about Max . The nightmares have stopped ; He 's not talking about killers - all the time anymore . - Max will be fine , baby . - He 's okay . - Max thinks you 're a superhero . What is gonna happen when he finds out - that you killed someone ? - How is he gonna find out ? - He 's not gonna find out . - You 're gonna be changed . He 'll know you 're different . Will this never be over ? It 'll be over tonight . Okay ? It 's gonna be over tonight , all right ? No . Breakwire . Trevor , it 's Martin . Look , I 'm just leaving the prison . A few things aren 't adding up . Phillip Green actually worked at the antique store that was allegedly robbed . He was a watch repairman . $ 20,000 high-end Rolexes and the like . And then I found sworn testimony from the store owner , Lee Zedner . He said that nothing was actually stolen . So why would three bystanders get involved in a robbery that doesn 't even look like it was happening ? I mean , who were these guys ? Were they off-duty cops ? Security guards ? Do you have any background on the victims ? Hold on . Hmm , looks like all three of them work for the same company . Shipping company- - Mobius . What did you just say ? Mobius- - ring any bells ? Mobius is a division of Aster Corps . So Phillip Green randomly shot and killed three Aster Corps employees ? There 's nothing random about it . Where 's the antique store ? 948 . I 'm sorry ? 948- - It 's a number that my son ... Never mind . Mr. Zedner ? Call me Lee . - Martin Bishop from Breakwire . - Oh . Thank you for making the time . Of course . I figured there 'd be some interest in this place today . Frankly it 's been pretty quiet . I guess the big story 's up the road at the penitentiary . I 'm trying to stop what 's happening up there at the penitentiary , maybe you can help me . I would love to see Phillip live through the night . Never made any sense to me that he did this . What do you remember from the night of the murders ? Please . I , uh , I closed up 6 : 00 , like always . Phillip left when I did . Around midnight , the police woke me up saying the place had been burglarized , three people were dead . I came right down . They told me that Phillip had been arrested at his house with the murder weapon , I-I couldn 't believe it . You testified ... that he didn 't take anything from the store . Nothing was taken that belonged to the store . What does that mean ? Phillip liked to build machines . Intricate little metal things . He asked if he could store a box of them in the safe . I told him , " Phillip , a store full of Rolexes and antiques , no one was gonna bother with his homemade machines . " He insisted . Cops found the box at his house . That 's what he took that night . What kind of machines ? Well , uh , I got them right here . He , uh , he built the stuff out of spare parts from my shop . Some of my tools are in here . Just don 't make sense . Why would Phillip kill three people to take something that already belonged to him ? You 're right , it doesn 't make sense . - Everything all right ? - Yeah , it 's fine . Hey , guys . Have you made progress in your search ? I think so . Phillip Green was trying to protect what was inside that box . The men he killed worked for Aster Corps . They tried to take it from him , he did what he thought he had to , to protect it , keep it safe . What is that you 're building ? Is that a cipher ? What 's a cipher ? A cipher , an algorithmic tool for performing encryption . The wheels have numbers and symbols engraved on them . I don 't know how this particular cipher works , but they 're used for sending and interpreting messages . But the question is what kind of message is important enough to kill for ? I don 't know but I think I know who does . Dr. Gordon ? Thank you for seeing me again . Yeah . You and your father ? You know , I ... I used to play piano and ... My first recital , my father was so proud that he clapped so loud and he screamed out that he loved me . It was horrifying I , um , I told him that he wasn 't allowed to come to any more recitals or plays or anything in public and he , uh ... he begged me not to ban him . He promised that he would keep his enthusiasm to himself . And after that , he 'd sit quietly in the corner , and when I 'd come onstage , he would just ... hold up three fingers . That was his ... symbol for " I love you . " I ... love ... you . He 's just ... he 's not ... He 's not the man I thought he was . I think he is . And at the very least , he is not a cold-blooded killer . But he pushed me away . My whole life , it was just me and him , and then he ... I would have stood by him . I would 've done everything I could 've done to help him . But he wouldn 't talk to me . He would not even look at me . Your father may have emotionally shut down because of the horror of what he did , but-but I think that he was trying to protect you . From what ? A company called Aster Corps . The men your father killed were not innocent bystanders- - They worked for Aster Corps . This is the same company that was conducting tests on your father . These people are ruthless . I think he thought if he told you anything that they would come after you . Wait . You 're saying that my father knew the men that he killed ? Yes . They were trying to take something from him . What ? Do you know what this is ? Oh , my ... That was his . He worked on this thing for years . He made every marking , every wheel . When I asked him what it was , he made up this story , a kid 's story . He said that it was a road map to finding 36 magical people who could save the world . One of the ... the gears is missing . Uh , the main one , the-the key . - Where does it go ? - Uh ... Right here . Won 't work without it . If you 're planning on saving the world , you 're gonna need it . Look , I-I know this sounds crazy , but I know about the 36- - My son is one of them , and I think that your father is , too . I think he invented this machine so he could find the others , communicate with them somehow . Uh ... okay , I 'm sorry , but ... y-you-you really believe that there are 36 people who can save the world ? I didn 't at first . I mean , I was like you . I was ... skeptical . I laughed at it . But the truth is I 've seen too much . So , yes , I do believe that there are 36 people whose sole purpose is to maintain the balance of our planet . I-I think that your father killed those men in an effort to protect the others . I think he led me to you because you 're the key to saving his life . And I believe that he loves you more than anything in the world . But that doesn 't matter . The only thing that matters right now is what you believe . It 's time . Mr. Miller . Phone . Thank you . This is Ben Miller . Ben , it 's Martin . We 're on our way to the prison . Dr. Gordon 's with me . They 're taking him to be prepped right now . - Where do you stand on the appeals ? - All denied . There 's nothing else that we can do . Our only chance is the Governor . Okay , please , j-just let Mr. Green know his daughter is on her way . - Hurry . - Yeah . Thanks . Nine-four-eight . Nine-four-eight . What does that mean , my boy ? Guard station . - Yes , I 'm trying to reach Ben Miller ? - Hold on . Thank you . Hello ? - Ben , it 's Martin . - Martin . Phillip Green has 20 minutes left to live . Look , the protestors and the news vans are making it impossible for us to get through . All right , listen to me . Make your way over to the east entrance . All the protestors are at the west . I will try and clear it so you can get in the door . Okay , I got it . We lucked out , man . You have any idea how many guys try to get picked for this ? A lot . You and me ? We 're gonna make history . You nervous ? No . I was just thinking . I 'm nervous . It 's a pretty wild thing we 're doing here . I mean , the guy totally deserves it , but ... still . Warden gives us the signal , you and me press our buttons at the same time . That way , neither of us ever knows for sure that we killed the guy . That supposed to make us sleep better at night ? Well , I 'll sleep fine either way . I 'm gonna go for a smoke . Don 't get lost . This thing 's supposed to be done on time . I 'm just ... getting some air . Please . Please , can you help us ? This is Dr. Kate Gordon . Her father 's scheduled to be executed tonight . - We need to get in as fast as we can . - I 'm sorry , sir , - I 'm not authorized to do that . - Her father 's attorney , Ben Miller , said we can get in at the east gate . Look , the front is completely jammed with protestors and news vans . - Please ... - Dr. Gordon ? Mike ? What are you doing here ? I work here , I 'm a guard . You know them , Mike ? I know Dr. Gordon . She 's my son 's doctor . Maybe you could help us . Her father is scheduled to be executed in less than 15 minutes . We need to get inside now . It 's your father ? Yeah . Can you call it in , please ? And hurry . Yeah , sure . Thank you . - I don 't mean to put you in an ... In an awkward situation - No , no , I just ... I didn 't know . How 's Max ? He 's good . Yeah , I mean , I think . You 've done a lot for him , you know . You 've helped , and I just want him to be okay , you know ? Max takes his cues from you . He 's okay if you are . Hey , I didn 't know Phillip Green was your father . I 'm sorry , I ... You 're cleared to go in . - Thank you . - Thank you . - Thank you so much . - Thank you . George , they 're cleared ! You okay ? Yeah . Could you get the warden 's office on the phone , please ? - I ... - Yeah . I want to tell them something . - Sure . - Thanks . - Martin . - Are we too late ? No . I just got a call from the warden 's office . - There 's been a delay . - What kind of delay ? One of the execution team members just dropped out . They 're searching for a replacement . - They 're clear . - Where 's my father ? He 's right through here . They brought him back out to the holding pen . Thank you . Now , remember , Kate , no contact . My whole ride up here , I-I thought about what I would say first . But now that I 'm here , I realize ... I 've been trying to figure that out for 15 years . Martin told me that he believes you stopped talking to protect me . And , God , that is the only thing that has made any sense in all of this . God , daddy , I 'm so sorry . Sergeant Morales . Yes , sir . We 're back on . What about the Governor ? There 's still a chance , he has until the final moment , but ... I did what you wanted : I brought your daughter here , now if there 's something you want to say , you need to say it now . Do you understand ? You need to say it now . All right , Phillip , let 's go . - Nice and easy . - Please ! - Daddy ... - Please ! Daddy . I 'm not leaving , you won 't be alone . It wasn 't supposed to happen like this . I was supposed to stop it . You can 't . He did what he had to do . And he 's willing to pay the price . But I can remember him now . Kate . If you want to go , we have to get to the gallery . Thank you . Uh , excuse me , sir . Mr. Green left this for you . It 's his belongings . _ Thank you . Avram ? Martin . Where are you ? I 'm just leaving the prison . It looks like they 're gonna go forward with the execution . I 'm sorry . But perhaps that 's not your mission . - What do you mean ? - It 's possible your mission was just to find the cipher . Do the numbers nine , four , eight mean anything to you ? Nine , four , eight . 948 Midvale . It 's the address of the antique shop . That 's where the murders were committed . Yes . I think Jake wants to go there . I 'm on my way . Thank you so much for seeing us so late . No trouble . I live close by . We 're definitely here for a reason . Could we please see that clock ? Of course . It 's a sentimental favorite of mine . In fact , Phillip fixed it for me the night he was arrested . Perhaps his way of saying thank you and good-bye . - Uh ... - Jake . I 'm-I 'm sorry . How mu ... how much is the clock ? $ 250 . - Thank you very much . - Thank you . Oh , my God . What is it , Martin ? I-it 's the key to the cipher . Einstein believed in timelessness ; he believed that all of time exists at once : Past , present , future . Everyone we ever knew and everything we 'll ever be , is with us in this moment . If this is true , then all moments are equally real and accessible to us . We just have to know how . Trevor . What is it ? Lucy . Lucy ? Oh , no . No ...

 Sieg Heil , Mondjugendunterführerin Renate Richter ! Heil Hitler ! Boys and girls , please sit down . Dieter , don 't you know where to put your behind ? Fräulein Richter : Since the Mondführer 's 65th birthday the appropriate salute has been : " Heil Kortzfleisch " ! You 're such an exemplary boy . Today , we 'll start with the most unpatriotic language . It 's the language we need to know when we return to those ... who need our help . Attention ! The National Hymn . Heil Hitler ! - Hitler ? [ coughs ] - What is that , Mr. Adler ? - A spy from the Earth . I captured him myself . He seems to be the leader of the shock troops . Mr. Adler , is this a joke ? I 'll be damned ! My heart . - What 's for lunch today ? - Sauerkraut . Again ! Please say that 's not true . Capture him ! No ! Capture him ! Don 't shoot ! The fugitive is a male negro , unarmed , but possibly angry . What does he look like ? Where does he come from ? What is he wearing ? How do I look ? Like they say in English- - Klaus ! Don 't shoot . We need him for tests- - - Take him to Dr. Richter 's laboratory . - By your command ! Dumb negro . - He talks nonsense . - It might be a dialect . - Probable reason is the skin colour . - Right . His brain structure is different from us Aryans . Let 's open up his skull and measure the brain . No . I need to know why he 's here . You have 24 hours , Doctor . Otherwise I have to rely on an ancient , infallible technique . Pain . - Mr. Adler . - Call me Klaus please ! May I come in ? Of course . I 've come to discuss our legal union . - Is that a marriage proposal ? - There 's no need for marriage . I received confirmation from the Department of Racial Purity . - Our genetic match is 97 percent . - How romantic . Science demands us to unite physically . It 's our destiny to produce perfect offspring for the people . What about my scientific research ? One day , Renate ... All this will be ours . But first , I must conquer the Earth . Wolfgang , the old fart , stands in my way ... In the way of final victory . The two of us will take on an enormous responsibility . Your place is by my side . Gentlemen ! Battleship Götterdämmerung . Our miracle weapon that has been under development for 40 years . The dream of our beloved Führers . But unfortunately only a dream , until now . - Please , Doctor . - Watch this ! This tiny device has over a thousand times more computing power than our biggest computers together . I engineered this cable to connect this machine with our main computer . I call this the Universal Systematic Binding : USB for short . This will lift it into the air . Finally , The Götterdämmerung will fly ! Yes ! You saw it ! You saw it with your own eyes ! Mein Führer , please let me return to the Earth , let me get more of these devices . - No one has ever returned . I will return . We don 't have a choice if we want to prevent an invasion from the Earth . Looks good . This will solve our little problem . I 'm coming . Looks very good ! And now we just ... - Why don 't you take me with you ? - Don 't worry , darling . After I 've completed my mission , I 'll come back to you . That 's not what I mean I 'm an Earthologist ! I know everything about it . You need me . You sweet little thing , where do you get all those crazy ideas ? Books , mostly ... and some films . I shall return triumphant ! - Heil Hitler ! - Heil Kortzfleisch ! - Get it through your skull . - Of course , mein Führer . We have one more ace up our sleeve . Show him what we have . Little snowflake , little white coat ... Voilá , gentlemen ! - Doctor . - Now watch closely gentlemen . Heil ! Stand up , you fool . Sieg Heil ! Oberführer Adler , I hope you 've discussed my return to the Earth . Something along those lines . The Reich trusts you . Thank you Doctor . Take care of your daughter for me . Sieg Heil ! See you in Valhalla . Renate ! What are you doing here ? This is not the place for the mother of the children of the future Führer ... and definitely not the place for a woman ! My place is by my man . A Volkswagen van . - Doesn 't he know ? - No . He 'll be thrilled . Thank you . Good evening , boys . Heil Hitler ! The name 's not Hitler ! Do it , Moon Corporal . And you want to eliminate the Mondführer ? Do you know the penalty for high treason ? This is flagship Tannhäuser speaking . We 've reached the orbit and we 're ready for the Valkyries to start . Battleship Heinrich ready for attack . Battleship Biterolf ready for attack - The fleet is ready , mein Führer . - Excellent . Tell them to wait for my return . We shall then begin the Meteorblitzkrieg . We 'll wipe all these sub-humans off the face of the Earth . Klaus ! Oh well , a blessing in disguise . Now I can kill all the enemies of the Reich in one stroke . Farewell , Puppet Führer . They develop like ordinary women . But look ! No hair here , nor here . Like little girls . And when they do have hair , it looks like ... The moustache of our great Führer . The pictures kind of turn me on . Sieg Heil ! Mr. Adler . Where 's the Führer ? The Führer is dead . Long live the new Führer . That 's me , in case you 're wondering . Sieg Heil ! This way . Klaus ! Heil Hitler . From now on , of course , it 's " Heil Adler " . The time is the sin . I 'll see you in Valhalla . At 5 : 45 we 'll start firing back . Every bomb will be retaliated for . The Meteorblitzkrieg shall begin ! Heroes of the First Fleet , continue your attack to the last man- - and remember , you 're fighting for the Reich ! Where the hell did they come from ? Prepare an appropriate uniform for the Führer . The Fatherland is calling its children ! This device will complete the biggest war machine of all time . The Götterdämmerung will fly - Heil Adler ! Attention ! Heil Adler ! Heil . As you were . Well ? The Earth fleet will be within firing range in 20 minutes . - Are your troops ready ? - We 're waiting for Dr. Richter . Out of the way ! Who dares disturb me ? Who dares disturb me ? - Doctor Richter ! How much time do you need ? - The Götterdämmerung will fly . It will be ready for the final victory . Cut the crap . How long ? Let 's say three months , give or take a little . You have three minutes . He cut me off . It 's not that easy . Russia wasn 't conquered in a day- - Start the Helium-3 engines . Now ! Start the engines . Load the cannons . Shit ! - Are the cannons ready to fire ? - Yes my Führer . But the Earth is below the horizon , on the other side of the Moon . We can 't shoot . Full moon was yesterday . Let 's make a brand new horizon . Fire at will . Reactivate the systems , Weapons NCO . We 'll see- - NATIONAL HYMN For motivation , break glass It 's no time to sing now ! It 's a false alarm ! Are you all imbeciles ? Go and see what 's going on ! On the double ! Renate ... - I won 't let you do it . What will you do ? Shoot me ? Good girl ... Renate Richter , my bride-to-be . You destroyed something beautiful , something wonderful . A future world full of Aryan children . Our Aryan children ! But you betrayed me , and for that , you shall pay . Your beauty shall adorn Odin 's table . Klaus ! Wait ! Let me do something . - Now ? I 'm a bit busy . - I 've always respected you . As Führer , and as a man . I 've even loved you . I belong to you . To you . Cute little speech . But it 's too late , my dear . Good bye . I understand . I hail you . My Klaus . Sieg Heil , my Führer ! Shit ... No . Please don 't , never again ! Please stop . What was the Earth like ? Different . When can we go there ? Soon . Soon . But how ? - In peace .

 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... You came into my house and stole from me , and I will respond in kind . Gone ! Someone is undoing my life 's work ! They 're all here . Artie ? I 'm not sure this is everything . Those are shipping supplies . Ow ! God , what now ? Yeah , we gotta get you off that metronome . I don 't know if it 's possible . You , sir , owe me a dinner . A very nice dinner . Steve ! How is the research coming ? I 'm only halfway through the " A " s . Do you have any idea how huge the Warehouse database is ? No . Tell me . You could have just said , " stupid question . " Stupid question . Well , you know who could help you , though ? Tech-savvy girl . Maybe with a bit of punk rock flair , and a bit of goth . Artie , if Claudia finds out that I 'm looking to disconnect myself from the metronome , she 'll just try and stop me , 'cause it 's dangerous . Oh , yes , of course . Yeah . She 'd probably find a way to blame me , too . Hey , look at me . When 's the last time you slept ? Right after I died . How am I supposed to sleep ? As long as Claudia feels any pain that I do , I 'm gonna be a little stressed out . It 's not fair that she 's being punished for saving my life . Artifacts are not fair . All right , off I go . Hey , hey , hey , hey . I 'll dive right into this with you as soon as I am back , and we will find something . All right ? Okay . But soft , what light through yon umbilicus breaks ? It is the east , and Dr. Vaness-iet is the sun . Arise , fair sun , and kill the envious moon- - Kill ? Yeah , there 's a thought . - Hey , is this new ? - No . Oh , come on . I think it 's so cute you officially have a girlfriend . - She 's not my girlfriend . - Are you seeing anyone else ? - No . - Do you want to ? - No . - She 's your girlfriend . Ooh ! I haven 't had a girlfriend since Nixon left office . Oh , well , get thee hence . Go forth and procreate . Oh , yes , that 's what we want , children . Wait ! Where are Pete and Myka ? I gave them an assignment . What assignment ? We 've been ping-less for 48 hours . It 's a Warehouse record . Where are they ? What are you keeping from me ? Spill . Oh , lord , why in your wisdom did you send me such a noodge ? Karma . That is new , isn 't it ? No ! - Et voilà , monsieur . - Oh ! You found it ! Is it the right one ? Make , model , and year , as requested . Oh , yeah , I don 't even want to know what kind of jingle bells - kinks you two kids are into . - Hey , hey , hey , hey . It 's a gift- - Not an artifact . And furthermore , show of hands . Who here , in this room , is not single ? - I rest my case . - So you do have a girlfriend . Ooh ! A little advice . Things have been going rather well , and I 've been considering asking Vanessa for a more ... geographical commitment . What , you mean , like , move in together ? Here ? Or in Univille , the Paris of the badlands ? - Who wouldn 't want to live there ? - Ooh , good point . Yes , perhaps a pied-à-terre in Featherhead is more the ticket . It 's just I don 't know if the timing is right . I think it 's a great idea , Artie . - You do ? - Yeah . - Thank you . - Is this new ? - Yes . - It 's lovely . Thanks . Speaking of timing , I 'm late . All right , if you need me for any reason whatsoever , you call me- - only if it 's important . Artie , would you just relax , okay ? - We 're old pros . - Yeah , go . Have a great weekend . Yes , I- - I intend to . I 'll try . Don 't be yourself . $ 300 ? Not bad for an impromptu clothing drive . Thanks to you , Kristen . All I did was tweet about it . You 're too modest . Oh , that reminds me , Father , uh , Mrs. Thompson was looking for pieces for a bedroom set . Someone just donated a dressing mirror , I think . I remember the package . I 'll go . Oh ! Oh , she 'll love it . " Click me . " Oh , goodness ! Oh ... Hello ? Is someone there ? Help me . Please , help me ! Hello ? Kristen ? Are you okay ? Tell me , Father ... Where can I find L 'Étoile ? - What ? - What ? - I--I don 't know- - - You don 't know . - I don 't know--what ? - L 'Étoile . I don 't know what- - Well , maybe this will jog your memory . Mmmmmm ... ha ! Damn , they 'll be here soon . I mustn 't me late . L 'Étoile . Where is it ? Kristen . Kristen ! What the devil has gotten into you ? Not the devil . Oh ! - Watch out ! - Aah ! Oh , show some skin , Kristen . Let me out of here , you bastards ! She 's such a sweet young lady . I 've never seen her like that . It 's like she 's possessed . Yeah , well , she does kinda have that whole Linda Blair head-spinning thing going on there . What 's wrong with her ? Father , has Kristen come into contact with any old or unusual objects lately ? We work in a thrift store . I will kill every one of you ! She doesn 't mean that . Well , this should be a fun interview . - Hi . - Hello , Kristen . - I 'm , uh- - - Myka Bering . And Pete Lattimer . Possession and telepathy . An artifact two-fer . Terrific . Kristen , we think that you may have come into contact with something that 's altered you . When , exactly , did you- - You should wear tighter clothes , Pete . - You 're lookin ' hot ! - Really ? 'Cause I do a thousand crunches , and I 'm just , like , oh- - - Pete ! Do you--do you remember touching something that perhaps you shouldn 't have--have touched ? I know what I 'd like to touch . Aah ! Ow ! You almost broke my finger , you psycho ! Take an ax and hack it to bits . O ... kay . We are not going to get anything out of her . Let 's , uh- - let 's go check out that thrift store . Yeah . Smile all you want . Linda Blair 's career was never the same . All right ... Okay . Ahh . Once more into the breach . Wow . Just the reaction I was hoping for . - Hi . - Hi . Mm . - Hi . - Hi . So I need just one more minute . Relax . Make yourself comfortable . And I like that jacket . What , this old thing ? Did you find someplace interesting ? Only the finest , most romantic restaurant in town . Granted , we don 't set the bar very high around here . Well , it 's the company that matters . I couldn 't ask for better . Whoa . - Shall we ? - Oh , yes . Not gonna let it go , are you ? Oh , you know me so well . You know , you and I could have totally solved the case of church girl gone wild , but no- - Jinksy had to be all , " You know--you know what ? I think we should let Pete and Myka handle this one . " That is absolutely me . Do Nicholson ! Oh , come on , you used to love action and adventure . Remember ? Bad guys and guns ! - What are you hiding ? - I 'm not hiding . Look , we 've been through a lot . I think that we should just take it easy ... for a while ... - Both of us . - Really ? Who died and made you boss of me ? Uh , I did . Well , what , are you ... afraid of dying again ? You know you can 't die , right ? That 's not what I 'm afraid of , Claude . Trust me . Anything sparking ? No . You know , unfortunately , my mother would love this place . - Eww . - You ? Nope . I mean , look , we could be here all night . Maybe not . Pete ? Spooky . Blood . Blood , blood . Blood . Blood , blood , blood . Hmm . Well , if you say so . Aah ! Sh- - " Click me " , huh ? Click you ! Pete this is- - this is mirror glass . What ? Would you help me with this for a second ? Okay . - It 's funny , this almost looks like- - - It is . Oh , my God , the mirror ! Aah ! No , we--we locked this in the Dark Vault years ago . Aw , come on , man ! Artifacts can walk now ? Pete , do you remember the rule of the mirror ? Yeah , uh , nothing comes out unless something goes in . Oh , snap , that wasn 't Kristen at the hospital ! It was Alice Liddell . She 's free ... again . Hi , handsome . You from around here ? Born and raised . Ooh . Then you must know where I can find L 'Étoile . Yeah , sure . It 's over at 6th and State . It 's a short drive from here . 6th and State . Ooh ... My hand is numb . Is that okay ? It might- - it might be too tight . The--the strap . Is it , um- - is it tingling ? It was , and now I can 't feel anything at all . Well ... Eleanor does have a tendency to go a little too tight with these . Crazy woman thinks she runs this place half the time . Feels so good . Mmm ... We 're all mad here . Shh . Unh ! 6th and State . All Alice ever wanted was to be free of the Warehouse . It looks like the little lunatic got her wish . She gets out of here , she 's gonna run . We could lose her forever . Hey , where is she ? Where 's the girl ? She 's dangerous . - I know . - Dude ! She smashed my face and took off . Secret Service . I need you to shut down this hospital now . No one gets in or out- - you got me ? - Yeah , but- - - Just go ! Why don 't women like me ? Pete , we just need to get inside her head . You know , figure out her next move . I 'm not sure " psychopathic nut job " is in my wheelhouse . Deep down , she 's still a little girl . We just need to think like a child . Okay , now , that 's in my wheelhouse . If I 'd just escaped from my magic-mirror prison , I 'd want to get as far away from the two of us as possible . - Where would I go ? - Pete . I really need to start looking down . Pete , she went this way . Alice , hands where we can see ' em ! Alice ? Who 's Alice ? Knock it off , Wonderland . We know you 're in there . Who are you people ? Where 's ... Father Mitchell ? Is this a hospital ? Pete , Alice wouldn 't know who Father Mitchell is . Okay , all right . Come on . There you go . What 's the last thing you remember ? I was in the stockroom unwrapping this mirror that came in , and then ... a bright flash of light . - And then- - - Nothing . Yeah . Like the whole world just disappeared , and all that was left was cold and darkness and- - - And silence . - Yeah . It was horrible . I never felt so alone . It 's okay . What was that ? Pete , that 's exactly how I felt when I was trapped in Lewis Carroll 's mirror that 's not Alice . - Then where is she ? - If I had to guess ... She 's inside someone else . Wait , wait , somebody else ? Do you think she 's figured out how to jump bodies ? I don 't know , but if she has , I mean , she could be anyone . Hey , where 's my ambulance ? And she 's mobile . I tracked here heading due south a few miles from your location . Uploading the coordinates to the Highlander 's GPS now . Wherever that ambulance goes , you 'll be able to find it . Awesome . Thanks , Claude . The mirror 's destroyed , so you guys need to find something to extract and contain Alice . Aye , captain . - Spock and Uhura out . - Thanks . I like it when I get to be Spock . Oh , you 're hilarious . Okay , now , I really want to understand this . Alice In Wonderland is actually a real account of a homicidal maniac trapped in a mirror that we have in the Warehouse ? Had . Which is totally freaky . That thing was locked down tight . Okay , two jobs . One , find a containment artifact for Alice , and two , figure out how that mirror got out . Paging Leena . Please retreat the Dodgson file and meet your party in the Dark Vault . I made that . Sylvia Plath 's typewriter can suck the life out of a person . Don 't get too close . Yeah , that 'll slow her down , but it won 't draw her out . Maybe her escape had something to do with the properties of the mirror ? Could she have found a way out on her own ? You said she 's pretty resourceful . Doubtful . It 's more likely the mirror got out first , not Alice . Somebody set her free . Hello . That 's the same thing Artie and I saw the other day . Please to ' splain . You 've seen one of these before ? There was a box of black diamonds at the storage space . What storage space ? Where the artifacts were stored . What are you talking about ? Artie said he was gonna tell you . - Tell me what ? - That someone 's been stealing artifacts from the Warehouse and sending them out into the world . Okay . So many questions . Well , uh , he wouldn 't say much , but he seemed to know who it was , and it 's clearly someone with a serious beef against him . All right , I 'm gonna have to check the security feeds . So these are what , the Pink Panther 's calling card ? Where is Lewis Carroll 's mirror ? Gone . Broken . And Alice is loose in Rapid City . So we 're looking for a new and hopefully permanent home for little Miss Cray-Cray . Liang-569 . The traps section . Oh , my God . - Bupkis up front . - The tire 's warm . Okay , the crash must 've just happened . She can 't have gotten far . Not without new wheels . There 's nothing . Pete ... over there . Bloody hell ! Let 's go . Alice ! Hey ! Who the hell are you ? I 'm you . That 's how she 's been body jumping . She 's got a piece of the mirror . Love to stay and play , but I have a very important date . All right , you put out the flames , - I 'll turn off the gas . - Okay . So you still think she 's a little girl ? I think it 's time we called Artie . Yeah . They should be done with dessert . Okay , it was a- - it was a bicycle that my father gave me for my seventh birthday . And it was all , like , pinky and shiny . And it had this cute little basket on the back of it . And it had tassels hanging from the handlebars . And the only thing it was missing- - Was a shiny copper bell ? I 've told you this story . Okay , well , that happens sometimes at this age , - Mm-hmm . - Your name 's Artie , right ? How--how do I know you ? I could hear you tell that story 1,000 times just to see that look in your eyes when you tell it . Vanessa ... I 've been thinking . We have these little rendezvous once a month ... And maybe we ... should do it more ? I 'd like that . You would ? I have something for you . It 's okay . It 's nothing fancy . It 's just something that I 'm absolutely positive ... - you don 't have . - Ooh . Sorry . All right , Pete , this better be so important . Alice Liddell is loose . Alice . - Where ? - Rapid City , South Dakota . Why is she in Rapid City ? 'Cause that 's where L 'Étoile is , uh , I guess . L 'Étoile ? The EMT that Alice body-jacked said she was in a hurry to get to something called L 'Étoile . And Myka says it means " star " in French . Yeah . It 's also a restaurant . Compliments of the house . We happen to be at L 'Étoile right now . I think you should absolutely join us . It 's got the best tiramisu in all of South Dakota . Hurry , before it 's 86ed . Artie ? Uh , you know , nature calls . I understand . So sorry . Somebody look after that poor girl ! Come on . Where are the people from this table ? Where , damn it ? Where , damn it ? This has Alice written all over it . Yeah , we should check with Artie . Artie , where are you ? No , uh , turn around . - Pete . - Yeah . Over here . Hey . So where 's Alice ? Alice , well , inside our waitress . Probably not anymore . She 's got a new trick up her sleeve . Girlfriend can body jump . Oh , great . What does she want ? What is she doing here ? Yeah , and how did she get out of the Warehouse ? Let 's not worry about that now . Let 's just focus on what is she doing here , and what does she want ? Well , we thought it was about her finally being free of the mirror , but it doesn 't look like she 's on the run . She 's hunting something , or someone . Me . She 's hunting me . Looks like somebody 's behind on inventory in this section . I figured I 'd get to it sometime before my 40th birthday . Save the date . What exactly are we looking for ? - This . - Right , okay . So the Warehouse agent who wrote Alice In Wonderland incorporated artifacts into the narrative . Like , the Mad Hatter is based on King George III 's crown , which causes madness . And the Stoner Caterpillar ? It says , " based on Hakim Abul Fateh Gilani , " 16th century physician whose hookah could draw a person 's spirit out of their body and trap it . " Sounds perfect . Now where is it ? Hey , you guys look here . I 'll check the next aisle . Spartacus 's retarius . Rube Goldberg 's wire collection . Ebenezer Thorndike 's lobster trap . Hey , is that it ? Where , up at the top ? Yes . Ugh , come to mamacita . Uh , Claude , be careful . None of that stuff looks like it 's nailed down . Oh , have a little faith . If I get to the top of this thing , I 'm naming it Mount Donovan . Aah . Ow ! What the hell was that ? Claude , are you okay ? Yeah . Yep , all good , Jinksy . - You 're absolutely sure ? - No , no , I 'm fine . - Do you feel any pain ? - It was just a quick- - Wait . Did Artie tell you about my phantom pains ? Yeah . Yeah . Ugh , that 's why you 're being so soft and squishy today . Are you protecting me ? - Yeah , yeah . - Oh , silly " wabbit . " Girl wonders can 't be killed . - Steve ? - Yeah ? What 's going on between you and Claudia ? What ? Nothing . Your auras just swapped back and forth . No , they didn 't . I know what I saw . And I have only ever seen that once before , and it didn 't end well . All right , saddle up , Jinksy . We 'll talk about this later . Let 's go smoke us out a psychopath . Takes one to find one . Be careful . Okay , Claudia and Steve are on the way with the Fateh-Gilani hookah . And now we have to find Alice . She could be inside any of these people . She 's probably still here , watching us . I mean , watching you . All right , look , while you two play " where 's wacko ? " - - Myks , do you still have those sunglasses with the mirrors ? - What ? - Yeah , no , no . That 's excellent . She 'll show up in the reflection . Oh , look at you , having ideas . I have ideas- - most of them are illegal . It 's so much more exciting out here in the field , you know ? Yeah . Well , on this date I was hoping for an entirely different kind of excitement . Hey . Here we go . No . No . Excuse me , Sparky . - No . - No . - Hello . - Ladies ? - Hi . - Hi . Oh , let 's see . No . You know , maybe we could- - I don 't know , - do dinner later , or- - ? - Pete ! If that mad monk thinks he can catch me - with my britches down ... - What ? He 's got--what ? Nothing . I--what ? Just stay behind me . Hey , we 're supposed to be protecting you , remember ? Maybe Alice decided to take off . No , no , she 's- - she 's here , Myks . I mean , I 'm having major vibe-age . Alice Liddell ! Gunfire ! Everybody get down ! Give us the shard ! - Get back ! - Hey ! Myka , she jumped out of the fireman . There . Secret Service , stay back ! Out of the way ! - Okay . - Please let this be Alice . No . It 's not Alice . Well , at least we know what she wants now . Yeah , she wants to kill Artie . And she could be anyone when we she does it . - Don 't worry , Artie . - Yeah , we 'll find her . Yeah . How we gonna find her ? I mean , we can 't make everyone in Rapid City look in a mirror . Wait , you know , it seems to me that if she 's looking for us , we have a slight advantage . Right . - We should set a trap . - And- - I know just the bait . Come on . Somebody order a soul-sucking hookah ? Okay , good , excellent . All right , let 's get the lay of the land . Two , three , four- - I count five--five exits . All right , Claudia , you take the front . Steve , take the two at the back . You two take the two up in the mezzanine . Where are you gonna be ? I 'm gonna be right here in the open , where Alice can see me . We can scope her out by using the reflective surfaces of the marble . - Or mirrors . - Or mirrors . That 's why you get the big bucks . What bucks ? There are no bucks . Fine . Listen , when she gets close , - you use the hookah . - Will do . When we catch her , what then ? Well , what I 'd prefer to do is bronze the little lunatic . But she has no corporeal form , so the next best thing is back into the Dark Vault . Unless you have a better plan ? Well , maybe we- - Probably not . Artie , what makes you so sure she 'll show up ? She 's a predator . I 'm her prey . She will not rest until she 's made her kill , trust me . All right , you two , up the mezzanine . Claudia , you keep an eye on the front door by hiding behind that plant over there . - Don 't let Alice see you . - Oh , thank God you said that . Because I was gonna jump up and down and yell , " Hey , crazy Alice , look over here . " You made your point . Thank you . Steve , should you be back at the Warehouse not getting hurt ? You were right , Artie . I have to tell Claudia about the metronome . Okay , first things first . Just--back doors . Where 's my mirror ? You , my dear , are going as far away from here as possible . That is not gonna happen . - Vanessa , I don 't wanna argue- - - I am a member - of this organization . - You are a doctor . - You are not a field agent . - I am the Warehouse doctor . Do you have any idea how many agents ' lives I 've saved ? - Including yours . - Yeah , I was hoping not to need a doctor this time . Besides that , I care about you . - Well , I care about you . - Well , good . Then this doesn 't have to come to fisticuffs . You have five exits , four pairs of eyes . You need mine , end of story . All right . You stand by the elevators . That 's as far away from here as possible . - Artie . - Yeah ? - This is a peppermint Patty . - Oh . - Sorry . - Thank you . Come on , take a breath , relax . Just pretend to use your Farnsworth or something . Oh , that 's smart . We make a good team . Yep , you guys are definitely not vampires . Good game . I 'm all clear . All clear here . Now we just wait and watch . I just--I wish that- - never mind . What ? What is it ? Something 's been bugging you . What is it ? It 's just , you know , I was trapped in that mirror for a few hours . Imagine a little girl trapped in here for over 100 years . It must be horrible . Yeah , well , she was already a bit of a homicidal maniac before the agents put her in there . Do you know how she got that way ? Yeah . No . She was at this tea party at the home of Charles Dodgson- - - Oh , uh , AKA Lewis Carroll . You see ? I retain . Very good . Anyway , um , curious Alice found Dodgson 's handgun . And her mother tried to take it away . And when she did , it went off . And she watched her mother die in front of the mirror that eventually became her prison . Look , it 's pretty tragic . But , on the other hand , she 's trying to kill Artie . So , oh , well . I know , it 's just the Warehouse has this nasty habit of turning people psycho . Yeah , well , tick-tock on us . Come on . Come on , Alice , I 'm right here . Where the hell are you ? Beg your pardon , but do you know which room Arthur Nielsen is staying in ? Oh , I 'm sorry sir . We 're not allowed to give away that information . Hotel policy . Yes , but you do know which room , don 't you ? Excuse me . Artie ! Vanessa ! Stop . Aah . Stop , or I 'll cut her wide open . Oh , my God . It 's not me she wants . It 's Vanessa ! No ! Stop it ! - Way to go , doc ! - Find the shard . Vanessa , did she hurt you ? No . She held this mirror to my face . No , you 're all right . You 're all right . I hope you know how to use that thing . Uh , open lid , extract spirit . Seems pretty straightforward . - You might wanna stand back . - It 's not here . The bellhop doesn 't have the mirror shard . - Then where 's Alice ? - She 's right over here . - Artie ... - Hands in the air . - Drop it ! - Oh ! Ha ha ha ! I can slit his jugular as quick as any one of you can squeeze off a shot . Alice . Alice . It 's me you want . You let Vanessa go . Take me instead . Artie , you and I both know this was about so much more than that . Don 't you get it ? Artie ! Artie ! Artie ! Brother Adrian 's the one who released the mirror and sent you here to kill Vanessa- - that 's the plan , isn 't it ? To punish me for not undoing the astrolabe ? See what happens when you play with someone else 's toys ? The people you love are made to suffer . You could have killed her before we came up here . - You didn 't do it . - Real suffering is knowing what lies just beyond your grasp yet never being able to reach it . I 'm gonna keep this body for a little while , and I 'm gonna do some unspeakable things to it before I cut your beloved Vanessa 's throat . - Oof ! - Sorry , Vanessa . Claudia--now ! Suck on this , Alice ! Ah ! Claudia ? Oh ! To hell with the bloody plan . Myka , hold her ! Open your eyes ! Get out of my friends , you bitch ! Yaaaaahhhh ! - Myka , get a bag ? - Okay , okay . Aah ! Are you all right ? Yeah . Yeah , no , I am . - I 'm not sure if Claudia is . - I guess we 'll have a story to tell her . Oh ... oh ... - Vanessa . - My ribs hurt . Yeah , I bet they do . - Oh , that 's more in my head . - Oh , Pete , don 't get up yet . - It 's okay . - Okay ... Jeez , what 'd you do to your shoulder , huh ? Oh ! Uh ... Oh , my God . Oh , my shoulder 's killing me . Okay . Yeah , I-I think that you and Steve need to have a little conversation . A what ? Ow , ow , ow ! Vanessa . We got her . It 's over ? Oh ... Yeah . All right , so we 're heading home . Dr. V , pleasure , as always . Mwah . Artie , I 'll , uh , see you in the morning . Jingle , jingle . Actually , I 'm gonna go too . You 're leaving ? This was a mistake . Well , not one of our top ten dates , but- - No , no , not the date . This . Us . What ? Look ... I always believed that the life of a Warehouse agent , by necessity , had to be one of solitude , isolation . And then you came into mine . And you ... You gave me hope ... I could have more . But after seeing your life threatened simply because I care about you , no , this is a mistake , and as long as we 're together , - you 'll always be a target . - Whoa , hold on , hold on . A few hours ago , you wanted to up our game , and now it 's just over . Don 't you understand ? Anything more than a platonic relationship is just ... too risky . - Some risks are worth taking . - Some are not ! Look , we 'll ... see each other at the Warehouse from time to time . - No . - What ? No . You don 't get to just quit on us . That 's not how this works . But after what happened tonight- - It happens all the time in this job . Being connected to the Warehouse involves danger on a regular basis . No , no , no . This is not a debate . My life has become ... My life has become more complicated than I realized . And I cannot do this right now . I 'm sorry , Vanessa . It 's over . Hey . I don 't know what 's going on with you . But when you finally wake up and realize that cutting yourself off from the people who love you is a truly terrible idea ... Call me . I am not going anywhere . So that 's where the phantom pains are coming from . I 'm sorry . - How 's the shoulder ? - It 's still a little stabby . Regretting bringing me back yet ? You should have told me , Steve . Well , now you know how it feels . Okay , touché . I was hoping to disconnect myself first . What ? Ow ! No--ow ! - Okay . - All right . The metronome is the only thing keeping you alive . I can handle a little pain , apparently . And I get mortally wounded , can you handle a little death ? Because that doesn 't work for me . Look ... now that I know , we 'll figure this out together . We 're a team , are we not ? Yes . Come on . They 're waiting for us . Ow , ow , ow ! Sorry . Sorry . So Artie didn 't want to talk to you about what happened tonight . Nope . Just grumpier than usual , which is saying a lot . - Hi . - Hey . Claudia , however , found something in the Dark Vault that might tell us how the mirror got out . Jinksy says that someone from Artie 's past has been breaking into the Warehouse and sending out artifacts . - What ? - Basically undoing his life 's work as a Warehouse agent . But nothing 's showing up on the security feeds . Which would explain why I 've been having the mega-vibes . But not why Artie 's been keeping us out of the loop . Or what black diamonds mean . Look , guys , let 's not panic , okay ? He 's probably just trying to protect us . Yes , but from who ? First Hugo ... now Vanessa . You 're the one cutting me off from the people that I care about--not me ! You 're the one , Adrian . Not me . Not me ! Safe . It 's safe . I don 't know how you 're getting in here ... But if you 're here now , know this . You coward ! Coward ! I will find you , and I will stop you . Stop you . I 'll stop you . I 'll st--stop you .

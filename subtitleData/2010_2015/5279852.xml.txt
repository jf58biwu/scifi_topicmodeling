 Hello Maria . We were already expecting you . Hello Franziska . Weren 't you supposed to be at the market a while ago ? Did you oversleep again ? It 's always the same with you . I know . And the little one is hungry again too , right ? Breastfeeding still not working ? No , the pain in my breast is getting worse and worse . And there is just not enough milk for the little one . Did you go and see a doctor yet ? The doctor ? He doesn 't do much besides talking . He just blames it on the radio . Are you okay ? I 'm alright . I always cough when a car is passing by . What ? Sometimes you 're kinda strange . Shouldn 't you keep going ? Yes.You are right . Get well soon . See you tomorrow . And don 't slack around with Robert again . You are just distracting him from his work . Hello Maria . How are you ? Are you alright ? I 'm a little late . Don 't worry about it . The people won 't starve . I know , but the market is almost over and I have to go the American base . Do you know what you 'd like ? Hm , I 'm not sure . I 'd like some ... And for you ? Robert ? Ah , yes . Hmm ... just give me the usual please . I know you are in a hurry ... but I wanted to ask you if ... well , the thing is ... The two of us could go in the wood someday ... Ahhh ... I 'll bring a blanket and something to drink ... Don 't get me wrong . We can also go to the movies and or how do you feel about dancing ? Damn ! I 'll see you tomorrow , Robert . Oh Maria . It 's you . I didn 't even recognize you at first . Where are the others ? Well Maria . You 're kinda late today . The soldiers can 't be on break the whole entire day . But you 'll buy something , right ? My break has been long over ... and a second one ... no , I can 't do that . But I won 't tell anyone that you fell asleep in exchange . Maria ! That 's pretty sharp of you . Alright . I 'll take something . Let 's see.What 'd you got in there ? Can I have one of these apples and a pretzel . Thanks . How much would that be ? 20 pfennig . Keep the change . Thank you . Thank you . Private Anderson ! Oh ! Captain Welles . Isn 't your break already over ? Yes it is . I apologize ... ehm ... I just thought , I wanted ... 50 , you thought ? There is a lot left Maria . Yes , I 'll sell it on the market . Aha ... isn 't it a little late for that ? Here is what we do . I 'll buy all your food and give it to our kitchen ... Mmmh , then we finally get something fresh and delicious on the table . ... but only if you go out to a dance with me next Saturday . Would it be that bad to go on a date with me ? No , but I ... my stepdad ... I don 't think he would allow it . What happened to your real parents ? I gotta go , Wait . You gotta leave your things here . But if I can 't go outwith you ? Don 't worry about it . I 'm with the U.S. air force . We freed Germany . So I think I can manage to free you from you evil stepparents . And don 't forget . You owe me . Be on time tomorrow . How the hell do they eat these things ? Good morning , General Cooper ! Good morning , Captain ! Is everything okay , sir ? Wipe that smirk off your face . Just look at that mess . It must be damn good , since you put all that effort into it . Good ? Well , I can 't tell if it 's good or not . Does anyone even know what 's in there ? I don 't know either , but maybe I can help you out . I bought some fresh food from one of the town girls this morning . General Cooper speaking . Ehm ... yes ... You can go now ... What did the delivery contain that you just got ? Ah , sounds good . Bring me ... Jesus Christ ! What did you do now ? It 's not how it looks , Mrs. Hofmeier . Maria ... well ... Maria didn 't do anything . She is a witness in a murder well , we don 't actually know if it was murder we did discover a dead female body though ... That 's horrible . Well ... Maria is the one who found the dead woman . Do you know who she is ? Yes , it 's Angelika . Angelika Huber . But I 'm actually not allowed to tell you that information , ... so please be discreet about it I guess it will be in tomorrows paper anyway but until then , you can 't tell anyone ! Of course . Oh my God , that poor girl . Her parents must be devas-tated . Yes , I 'm sure of that . Well , I gotta go.We will do our best to find the son of a bitch who did it . Ah , one more thing , Mrs. Hofmeier . Obviously Maria is still very shaken up about what happened . It would be nice if you could go easy on her and take care of the poor girl . I mean , you don 't find a dead body on a daily basis . Oh , I will take care of her for sure . You got to be kidding me . Don 't you think I know what 's going on . Just stop with the innocent act . You overslept again . I 'm sure you were only able to sell half the food . No , I sold everything . Maria , stop lying to me . Did you throw it away ? No . Here is the money . I sold everything . I should have never taken you in . Nothing but problems is what you cause , you unthankful thing ! ... now hurry into the stable ... the cattle won 't feed itself ! After that you have to clean the kitchen . Once you 're done with all your work , go up to your room . I don 't want to see you anymore today . Sepp , you scared me to death . You saw them . Am I right ? They are here to get us ... all of us ! Sepp ... what 's wrong with you ? Look ... what they did to me . These monsters ! Yes ... run kid . Run ! But it won 't help . Is the little one in bed already ? Yes , he fell asleep right away . Could you make me a sandwich ? I have to get up early in the morning and I 'm in a hurry . I will . When will you be back home ? I don 't know yet . But it could take 2 to 3 beers . But before any strangers will climb through your window , I 'll be home . Ha ha , who would ever be interested in me . Who knows . Oh come on ... See you later . What 's going on with you ? I have to tell you something . You can tell me everything . You know that . Do you love me ? You know that I like you a lot ! What 's wrong with you ? I recently had a child . Shit ! Why does this keep happening to me ? And now ? What do you think of me ? Who is the babies father ? I 'm for sure not it . I want you to be its dad . I want to raise it together with you . Me ? Raise a child ? That 's not my responsibility . Forget about it . I can come to America with you . This was all fun but I don 't want to spend my life with you . And now ... get out of my car . Hans ? Is that you ? I don 't find this very funny ! Nothing ... I can see nothing . No scratches . No indication of a fight . Nothing conspicuous . She wasn 't raped either . There is nothing , except these weird marks on her breast . Who does something like that ? Maria ! Good morning Robert . Aah , don 't put anything there . I heard what happened yesterday . How are you ? It was so horrible ... Her eyes . They just starred at me . I will never forget that . Please let us talk about something else . Seems like you are really busy . Oh well ... just the usually , you know . What 's underneath here ? An experiment ? Ahh , don 't touch that . I 'm sorry , I didn 't mean to be rude . But what 's underneath here can 't be exposed to sunlight you know . That 's why it 's covered with a sheet . Will you show me once you 're done . Sure . But it will be a while . That 's okay . Good . Maria , I didn 't wanted you to see this . What 's the dead woman doing here ? We are the only ones around here who can do a autopsy . That 's why they brought the body to us . Why didn 't you tell me ? You 've been through enough yesterday and I just thought it would be better if you don 't know . If I would have know that this evil man comes in right now then I would have done the autopsy in the afternoon . He scares me . Me too . I 've been working with him for a very long time now , but he barely talks . I don 't even know what he is working on right now . Do you think he is doing anything illegal ? No , no ... I don 't think so . Maybe I should try to find out ... No . In the end it will only get me in trouble . Are you still not feeling better ? I could check your blood . Do you think that will help ? Science is well developed . You 'd be surprised about how much your blood tells us about you . Maria , would you be free tomorrow ? I don 't know . Why won 't you ever go on a date with me ? It 's not you , I just ... Let it be . I know Maria it 's because of the soldier . No . The American ? No . What makes you think that ? Maria , I see the way he looks at you ... talks to you . He is just being friendly . Maria , I know people like that ... he is just a daredevil . Everything is okay here . No special occurrences . OK Captain Welles . Head back to base.The operation is done . Understood . I 'm on my way back . What the hell ... Captain Welles , is everything alright ? I don 't know . Something just ﬂew by me . What do you mean ? It was like a ﬂat plane . I couldn 't really see it well . It ﬂew by with very high speed . We don 't see anything on the radar . You must have been mistaking . No way . You must have seen it . We almost collided . Can you still see it ? No . It 's gone . We will check it out . Come back to base now . Roger ! Again ! What the hell is that ? That wasn 't here a minute ago . I guess we 're not the first ones . That 's General Cooper . What does he want here ? I 'm a little surprised to see you here . I was told about the crop circle . I 've seen this phenomenon before . I wanted to take a look at it myself . It seems like you 're taking this matter very seriously . Not at all ! And that 's why I want this issue resolved immediately . Mr. Stadler from the local police station already filed the case . As far as I can tell , this is vandalism . Yes , yes ... that happened often in the last couple of years but the bastard responsible for it , is always faster than we are . No surprise there . What do you mean by that ? Nothing . Don 't get fresh on me now . Mr. Stadler , Mr. Stadler ! A city police officer ... can 't I even get 5 without anyone disturbing me . What is it now ? We found 2 more dead women again . What do you mean ? Again ? Well , we already found one yesterday . That 's horrible ! Usually it 's really quiet here on the country side , but lately ... Would you mind if we take a closer look at the corpses tomorrow ? Be my guest . We are only a small town police station . If you can help us , that would be appreciated . I 'll see what I can do . Did you take the bodies away already ? Yes ... we put them in the car . Put them away then . They 'll rot in this heat . You can go too . Mr. Stadler , you mentioned that in the last years there have been a couple of crop circle sightings in this area ? I don 't think Mr. Stadler believes in your UFO , Captain Welles . Yes , I did hear about your adventurous ﬂight and the UFO sight-ing . Maybe UFO isn 't the right word for it . But yes , I did see something . And that 's not even all of it . Nonsense , Captain Welles . You mixed up the fields . With all due respect , sir , but I 'm pretty sure . I don 't want to hear about crop circles anymore . This conversation is over . Yes , sir ! We have more important things to do . As soon as you find something out about the dead women , let me know . But don 't waste too much time with it . It 's not really your concern . Of course , sir ! As soon as I found something out , I 'll let you know . Good . What is it , sir ? Is something wrong ? Look , the blades are not kinked , just bent . Well , I don 't see anything . 50 what . What do you think that means ? If you want to bend every single blade in an area as big as this one , you 'll either need hundreds of people or a very long time . But it must have happened within 5 minutes . And if that many people would have walked over the field , I would have noticed . No . It must have been something else . It 's just how I thought . It was just a couple of kids from the village . The same thing happens every year . Captain , you 're not saying it was actually an UFO ? I don 't know what it was . But I will find out . Sir , the ground here ... it 's very moist and soft just like somebody was digging here not too long ago . That 's not possible.The crop is still there . Nobody could have dug there . But look ... You 're right . Anderson , get me a shufﬂe . I wanna see what 's underneath there . Yes , sir ! You guys stay back . I don 't want to destroy any evidence . What evidence ? Should I start digging here ? Yes , but be careful . Oh God.What is that ? Maybe the answer to our questions . Who does something like that ? I don 't know . I hope you know what you are dealing with here ? This is not one of your little experiments . You have to completely discreet about this matter . This is very impressive . Dr. Holzlein , did you understand me ? What ? You can 't talk about this to anyone . Everything concerning this body will never leave this room . Do you understand me ? Of course . I 'm not stupid . This incident is unique . Maria ! This is not a good time . Maybe we could ... Wait a second . But don 't be scared.What you are about to see is not from this world . What is it ? It 's a creature from another world . From another world ... Did this creature kill the women ? Not this one . It 's been dead for a while now . But we are not sure if it is the only extraterrestrial creature on earth . Maria , you have to tell us everything you know . Have you ever seen something like that before ? Or did you notice strange lights in the sky ? I know this is all very exciting for you . But we have to find out everything about these creatures . We don 't know where they come from and what they want . Maybe they are here in a peaceful mission , maybe not . Stop scaring her already . She doesn 't know anything and hasn 't seen anything . How would you know ? If she knows anything , we have to know it too . She already said that she doesn 't know anything . I don 't think we 're done with you , Missy . You didn 't tell us the whole truth . Maria ! If you know something , please tell us . I don 't know anything . I I can 't really remember . Last night I walked through the woods by myself . Alone ? ... and there was something ... but I ... I couldn 't see anything . What was it ? What happened then ? I don 't know . I ran away . I was scared . But somehow ... all of it felt kinda familiar . Familiar ? What do you mean by that ? I don 't know . What did you find out ? Nothing . Everything is fine . Out with it.What 's in the files ? The 3 women we found all had a child shortly before they were murdered . Which means what ? I don 't know as of now , but that 's the only connection we have so far . In the end , Maria was spared only ... " because she doesn 't have a kid . That 's complete nonsense . Gentlemen , that 's no nonsense . Dr. Holzlein is completely right . Even if only a small part of that is true , what do you suggest we do about it ? Whoever abducted the women , will do it again and again . Until now , we are the only people who know about this and I 'd like it to stay that way . With Maria , on the other hand , we 'd have someone that we could use as bait . Bait ? What ? Well , if she get 's pregnant . That 's totally insane . We 'll see . I 'll bring you home now , Maria . You can 't ... I have to finish my rounds ... and then I gotta go and help bring in the hay . You won 't do this by yourself , right ? Maria , that 's just too dangerous . But it 's still light out . You 'll go home before it gets dark , okay ? This is very alarming . Exactly my words . Should we inform the public ? No ! We gotta keep this a secret for now . Yes , sir ! That would be it for now , Captain Welles . Yes , sir ! But if you allow it , I 'd like to inspect the crop circles again ? If you think that 's necessary . But you won 't find anything . Hey Jimmy , let 's party tonight . Let 's go all out tonight , okay ? I feel like we won 't have time to do that anytime soon again . Why ? After what happened in the last couple of days . They will plaster us with work . They will triple our guard shifts . Damn , I think you are right ! Come on . Let 's get a drink ! Do they have to celebrate tonight ? Especially now , when we are going through such a rough time . Dad , let 's go home . Mom is already complaining . Well , that 's how it is . Go ahead . I 'll be right there . Who do you think you are you ... Hey ... aahh ... I thin k that was my fault . I touched you by a mistake . It wasn 't on purpose . 50 I guess I just got the wrong one . Can we get you a beer ? I won 't say no to that . Jimmy , your beer is on me too ! That 's the least ! I think I gotta go and take a leak . I think I 'll come with . Did you lay hands on my girl ? Me ? I don 't know what you are talking about . I didn 't do anything . Hey.That was me . But your girlfriend already thanked me with a slap in the face . We 're good now . Nothing 's good . I 'll show you what 's good . Let 's go . Come on . There is a fight upstairs . Look . Let 's get him . Let 's go to base immediately . See . I told ' ya Jimmy . This is strange . The organs , if they even exist , are in completely different areas than they are in the human body . And still their mechanism seems to working like ours . They have some kind of blood and a lung-like organ . But what do they breath with it ? Oxygen ? What do you expect to find here , sir ? I don 't know . I 'm looking for answers . Come on . Let 's take a closer look at the field again . Oh ! Lysozymes ? Usually Lysozymes support the immune defense . But it seems like in this body they trigger some sort of reaction . Hold on ... this pattern ... that almost looks like ... Maria ! Where they hell did that come from ? Wait ! Don 't shoot ! What should we do now sir ? Just wait ! If they shoot first , we 'll have a problem . What on earth was that ? Good God ! There is some sort of strange liquid on the ground here . Yeah . It 's everywhere . God . It 's disgusting . It smells weird too . Kinda sour . You 're right . OK . Jimmy send a radiogram to base . And then let 's get out of here . Hello , this is Private Anderson . We are near the crop circles and I think we just saw an UFO . Did you find something , Private Ochmoniek ? I think there is an animal in here . Be careful , Private ! Ochmoniek ! Stay strong , Ochmoniek ! Don 't die on me ! I 'll get help . What happened ? One of these monsters came to life ! What ? Where is Ochmoniek ? He is dead . There is another one ! Stay where you are ! I don 't think this monster will listen to you . But there is a language everyone understands . It 's not dying . Why is this monster not dying ? Let 's get out of here . There 're more of them . Safe your ammo . There is more of them . We won 't be able to pass them . Let 's head into the other direction . Maria ! May God be with us . They have risen . Come on . Come on . Are you hurt ? Maria ! Are you hurt ? No . It almost got me . It 's okay . You 're safe now . I 'll protect you . No , no ... no , no , no ... please , please ... What ? We ... gotta get out . No ! Don 't go out there ! Maria , the monster is far away . If we hurry , it won 't get to us . Can you run ? Okay then ! Hurry ! Hurry ! Come on , come on , come on , come on ! There is more of them . Shit ! We can 't get away from here . Obermeier . What ? Obermeier 's old house . Yeah.You are right . We can do it . Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! Wait ! Ouch ... holy sh * * ! Once a week I 'll bring old Obermeier some food . And what should we do now ? To be honest ... I don 't know . That 's Captain Welles with someone else . You stay here and if something happens , you lock yourself in and stay quiet . Captain Welles ! We 're here ! Anderson , come on ! I need a break . Watch out ! We gotta get away from here ! Is Mr. Anderson hurt ? We have to bandage the wound . We do , but I 'm sure I 'm better at it than you are . Get a gun and make sure nothing comes in here . Maria , you have to help me . Please get me some alcohol and water . Does it hurt badly ? No , but everything is so blurry . Is that normal ? Yes , it 's just your circulation . Rest a bit and you 'll be fine . Thanks . What kind of creatures are that ? They are living dead . Living dead from outer space . And what can we do about them ? Nothing , it seems like . Our Mr. Scientist can 't seem to find a useable solution . You shooting around didn 't get us very far either ! But where ... where are these monsters coming from ? The crop circles are their graves . Basically huge cemeteries underneath the ground . They could have been there forever . Maybe even before we humans existed . And why are these dead aliens rising from their graves ? How would I know ? Windows and doors are secured . We are safe for now . There are more and more coming towards us . I wonder how all the people out there are . I 'm sure they are all safe . The end is near ! We gotta get outta here ! We can 't leave the humans to their destiny . Let me ! What should I do ? Arrrgh ... damn it ! What the hell ! Stop ! Move ! Move ! I don 't give a rats ass . Is that ... Sir ? What ? There have been reports . People claim they saw creatures from another world . There are no creatures from another world . But sir , people have been killed . Damn ! Okay . Lock down base . Yes , sir ! Alright my friends . This time we 'll shoot you back to Mars . Damn bastards . You bastards ! Open the damn gate ... Don 't panic . This always works . We 'll put the last two onion pieces in our pork hedgehog ... ls anybody out there that could help us ? I 'm sure this happened to you before.You 're in the kitchen ... And ? What 's going on ? Any news on television ? No , nothing . Maybe here is where it all started and the others don 't even know any of this is going on . Why here and not in a big city ? I 'm telling you , the ones out there know damn well what 's going on here . Nonsense ! It doesn 't matter where the monsters are coming from.We 're not safe here . You got a better idea ? I 'm off to the Americans . I 'm safe there . I 'm sure they will ... 50 help me please ... This is not my business . Enjoy ! Help me father ... help me ... Our Father , who art in heaven . Hollowed be thu name ; thy king-dom come ... Who 's there ? Show yourself ! This is the house of God ! God didn 't create you ! No ! Maria , could you get me a glass of water ? Sure . I 'll be right back . Maria ? Maria ! Robert ! What happened ? Where is Maria ? Professor Stock ... he took her . Where did they go ? Into the woods . We gotta get Maria back . Are you crazy ? There are tons of those monsters out there . You don 't get it , do you ? Maria is the key ! What do you mean by that ? Her genes have been crossed with the aliens ' ones . What did you find out ? Every abducted woman had been drained off her breast milk completely . What ? Due to my research , the aliens can 't survive on this planet very long . They don 't have a body defense mechanism . They would die pret-ty quickly . But they found a way to extract a good body defense mechanism in a concentrated way through human breast milk . With the lysozymes in there , they are able to resurrect the dead aliens again . They are practically invincible . What does Maria have to do with all that ? Her blood . Her blood has the same structure than the aliens ' blood . Not a very strong body defense mechanism , but just enough to survive on earth . She is some sort of experiment . A pioneer of a new race . But why do the aliens make their dead come alive again ? To create new living space . Professor Stock . I should have known . He knew about Maria from the very beginning . Where could he have taken her ? The crop circles ... yeah ... maybe the crop circles ... Let 's not waste time then . If that 's true , I know where we have to go . What do you want from me ? Let me go ! Move over ! Sir ! What is it ? We discovered an UFO . Really ? Fascinating . I can 't ... I just ... I can 't walk anymore ... Are you insane ? We gotta keep moving ! Just leave me here . Is everything alright ? I 'm sorry ... I don 't know what 's going on with me . Everything is so blurry . He is burning . What 's going on with him ? He is changing . Changing ? Into what ? He 's got a virus . He was infected through the bite . Bullshit ! Let 's go . Something strange is going on in me . I can feel it ! I will try to fight back the monsters as long as I can . Go ! Get out of here ! Open up . I have a child here . Open up now . I have a child with me . Cowards . Come on . This way ! You 're too early . The invasion shouldn 't have started until a couple of weeks . Time is up . We have to start now . Your monsters attacked us before . What was that all about ? We had to take that risk in order for the plan to work on time . But I almost had the girl where I wanted her . A couple more days and I would have fertilized her . That doesn 't matter . Everything is going according to plan . According to plan ? According to plan ? What does that mean ? The last crossing has to be done with a human again . We will create an even stronger race than you could have ever accomplished . The strength of the human body , combined with our intelligence will create a race , that will rule the whole universe . We calculated everything threw and the plan is working perfectly . And when will you be done cleaning out the earth ? The other ships will arrive in 2 days . Everything is prepared for . As soon as we are done with our invasion testing here , we can clean out the whole earth within 3 days . And I can rely on you to spare the regions I requested . It will happen as we discussed . Go now . I have to finish up this project . There would be one last thing . What ? The plans ! The plans ! And now go ! Go ! Outstanding ! We gotta get in there ! Will they know that we are coming ? I don 't think so . Seems like they do . Let 's go in ! Fascinating ! Now we 're locked in ! It doesn 't matter . We won 't leave here until we 've found Maria . Why are you doing all of this ? Well ... how can I put this ... I love her ! What about you ? Why are you here ? Because that 's who I am . Does that mean you 're not in love with Maria ? Maria ! Maria ! Maria ! Are you alright ? What did you do to her ? I don 't think he understands us . I understand you perfectly well . You can take down your armor soldier . It won 't help you in here anyway . We don 't need weapons to defend ourselves . Your weapons won 't work in here . Why are you doing this ? Because we need more living space and this planet is perfect for that . No it 's not . I performed an autopsy on one of your bodies . You can 't survive on this planet . We won 't , but the new race will . We crossed our DNA with yours . Soon our race will be able to live on this planet . And all of you will be gone . That 's sick . That 's not sick . It 's the future . A future , you won 't live to see . What was that ? That 's my boys ! Your primitive weapons won 't do any harm.You can 't beat us . Maybe not with our weapons , but I know your weaknesses . Your immune system . As of now , you are still not able to survive on this planet . We need fumes . Fumes ? Yes . Anything that smokes , fumes or reeks . The undead aliens usually only survive one or two days on this earth anyway . But if we harm their immune system immensely , we can defeat them within seconds . No problem . We got a lot of that ! The girl . Give it to me . John ! John . You guys are alright ? John . Get up . Can you walk ? Get up ! Let 's not waste anytime . I think that 's it . These monsters tried to kill me before . But they won 't get me . Don 't shoot ! It 's us . Everything okay sir ? Yes , Sergeant . How did you know we were here ? We saw the UFO on our radar . General Cooper sent us here . Cooper ? Really ? Yes sir ! Are there more monsters inside ? We only found one in there and it 's not alive anymore . How did you kill it ? Dr. Holzlein found out , that the aliens and the alien zombies are not resistance against fumes . Yes , sir . Yes , you heard me right . Produce as many fumes as possible . Are you hurt ? No . Everything is fine . Are we safe ? I don 't know ... Now we made it . It 's just because of all that smoke . That 's fine . We almost defeated all the monsters . Don 't you think that in the end all we do is defeat ourselves ? Nonsense.They can 't do anything to us.We won this war ! And I 'll find a cure for you as well . Yes , General . Understood . Code 19 / 47 . Yes sir . Absolutely ! To all units.We got a code 19 / 47 . I repeat code 19 / 47 . Please copy . Code 19 / 47 ! Stop resisting.You 're under arrest . You have to leave . What is it ? Everybody will be arrested and locked away . Code 19 / 47 . Why ? So nobody will be able to talk about what happened here . Well , they can 't arrest a whole village . If they want to , they can . In the end it would have been better if we hadn 't stopped the aliens . If you hurry , you can get away . Almost every soldier is in the village . There haven 't been any street blockings yet . If you 're careful , you can make it . Run away ? But where ? We don 't even have a car . 2 miles west from here is my car . And what about you ? You 're not coming with us ? No , my place is here . You gotta go this way . Thank you ! Will we see each other again ? If everything works out , then no . And now go . There is no time . Thanks . If she really is the key to saving mankind , the soldiers can 't get her ! Make sure she is safe ! Can I rely on you for that ? I 'll take care of her . John you have my word . I hope you can make it . Captain Welles , where is the woman ? I don 't know . He is lying . I saw them together . What we 're doing here is wrong . That doesn 't matter . If it helps us , it 's the right thing to do . Take him . He 's under arrest . Make sure all evidence is gone . Did you understand me ? Yes , sir ! 50 , Professor Stock . Here we go . Is there anything else I can do for you ? No.Thank you . That would be all . Well then . Make yourself at home . I will . Are you okay ? Yes.Thank you . Wanna get back on the road ? We still have along way ahead of us . Will we make it ? Yes ... we 'll make it !

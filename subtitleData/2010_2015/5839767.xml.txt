 Previously on " The Lottery " ... You told me that you could help me get my son back . We work with very powerful people . I purchased it last year . You want to take all the mothers , the kids ? I want to create a better world . President will approach the hotel roof from the south exit . I believe you want to kill the president . Hey , ATF just found a half-assed bomb in a dumpster . So you will change the security plan ? If they change the venue , our plan goes to shit . But even if I 'm not the mother , I would still want to be a part of my child 's life . No , I would want that , too . I would want you to be like the baby 's big sister . I can do sister . So , do we have a deal ? [ Panting ] Alison : I should have been there , too . We were working on this together . While he was looking , I was at home , in bed with you . Were you sleeping ? Yeah . She was right next to us . Darius : General Langdon 's planning to kill her . We have to do whatever 's necessary to protect what we love . [ Grunts ] Someone within the government decided to turn the infertility research into a weapon . Vanessa : It 's a D.C. plate number . " Mr. Torino " is a pseudonym ? For someone very powerful . A real beauty , huh ? Did you give it to charity ? How 'd you know that ? What is it ? You won 't believe it . What the hell 's going on ? It 's about my husband , isn 't it ? That 's why you won 't say anything . [ Knock on door ] [ Door closes ] A-are you okay ? Yes . Of course . What were you two talking about ? Nothing important . I find that hard to believe , especially as tomorrow , we 're going to make history . We 're going to announce the 100 winners . I could not be more proud of you both . You 've been unbelievable . Somehow , despite all distractions , you 've managed the lottery with grace and courage . Thank you . Now , what were you talking about ? To be honest , I 'm sick of all the subtext and code . We all just need to tell the truth and be honest with one another . I agree . We were discussing what to wear to the event . [ Chuckles ] That 's highly classified information . You should know that I 'm very good at finding the truth . Always remember that . When you get a minute , I 'd like to go over tomorrow 's events with you . For God 's sake , Vanessa , what is it ? Tell me . The president ... your husband ... is responsible for the fertility crisis . S01E10 In Extremis This is where we hit the convoy . Why there ? It 's just over the border in Virginia ... no D.C. cops . Only two lanes ... makes it hard for them to escape . But the best part is , there 's lots of freeways adjacent to the intersection . We can grab Elvis and [ Whistles ] disappear into the wind . [ Sighs ] Good luck with this . Thank you . It 'd be nice if one day , we don 't have to use guns to get our children back . I never knew my father . He died when I was young . But how you 're fighting for Elvis , I like to think that 's how he 'd fight for me . I 'm sure he would 've . I 'm looking forward to you and your son thriving in our new society . So , you got the embryos , then ? We have a plan in motion . Your friend Dr. Lennon has been a great asset . Thank you for introducing us . [ Chuckles lightly ] Now what ? I don 't know . I don 't know where to turn . I don 't know who else is involved . What I do know is that we have to finish what we started with the lottery . We have to announce the winners and plant the embryos . That is the most important thing right now . And then , we can deal with ... this other issue . I gave my life to that man . I ... I put off having a family to support his career , and now ... now you 're telling me he 's the reason I can 't have a baby ? It is incomprehensible , Gabrielle . I know . I know . [ Breathing shakily ] We have to focus on the lottery . - Yeah . - It is the future . And we have to keep our mouths shut . Mr. President . I just found out . Langdon was a good man ... a real good man . What the hell happened ? I don 't know . I just got the call myself . Son of a bitch survives Afghanistan , Iraq , Venezuela , to die stabbed to death in a bucolic park in our nation 's capital . Do the police know who did it or why ? No . They 're still investigating . I 'd be happy to look into it , sir ... talk to the lead detective , control the information flow . Thank you . And I 'm sorry . I know you two were close . I appreciate that . [ Monitor beeping ] I 'm so sorry . I should have been there with you . I feel like it 's my fault . And I 'm sorry . More than you 'll ever know . James ? You 're awake ? So that means you heard everything I just said ? You mean blaming yourself for something you had nothing to do with ? How are you feeling ? [ Chuckles ] I feel like ... like I got shot in the chest . [ Coughs ] I 'll get the doctor . Hold on one second . [ Grunts ] Check my pants . In the closet . I found that at Kessler 's house . You 're amazing . I 'll be in position when your men cause a disturbance . The Secret Service will evacuate the president via helicopter , but before he gets on , I 'll take him out . There 's been a change of plan ... the bomb threat . He 's now leaving through an underground garage . - So it 's off ? - No . Here 's the layout of the building . Tell me what you can make work . The event is this afternoon . - Exactly . - There 's no time . There 's no choice . This is the moment . Let me know if you have any questions . What the hell was General Langdon doing in that park ? It 's a mystery . He was my commander in Venezuela . He was a great man . Here 's the one thing we do know ... above all else , General Langdon was a patriot . He would 've wanted us to move forward and realize our objectives . The president dies tonight . Oh , my God . It 's the inoculation list . Damn it , James . You found it . [ Chuckles ] [ Beep ] Hi . I got your text . I was just about to call you . I know who Mr. Torino is . It 's Darius . It 's Thomas Westwood . What ? I saw an old photo of him standing in front of a green vintage Torino . It 's the same car . You said the sterility virus was generated by our government . Westwood used to run Darpa . He was the man in charge of all of those crazy military experiments . When was this ? Eight years ago . Right around the time the fertility crisis started . The president ? [ Sighs ] Well , we got to deal with the logistics , and that hasn 't been done . I 'll call you back . [ Cellphone beeps ] Madam First Lady . Can I trust you ? Of course . How can I be of assistance ? First off , let me say ... I love my husband very much . I know you do . How can I help ? There 's something I want to discuss with you . I want to go over the post-announcement agenda . Right now , the 100 winners will be transported to the Naval Hospital , they will be implanted , and they will remain under our medical supervision for four weeks . Yes . That 's what we discussed . I 'm thinking I want to extend our medical supervision for a longer period of time . Well , our medical staff thought that four weeks was more than adequate . I 'm concerned about relinquishing control . The second they leave , we will no longer be able to dictate the terms of their medical care . Well , our goal was never to dictate anything . The goal is to save the human race . You know , the closer I get to the end , the smarter Darius sounds . Will that be all ? What 's going on ? What do you mean ? Your attitude has shifted . Forgive me . I 'm just trying to do the best I can . Have a seat . I gave my life to this country . My life . Have I made mistakes ? Absolutely . But they were well-intentioned . They were in the service of the ideals of this country . All great leaders have regrets . I 'm no different . But today , those regrets are irrelevant . I will go down in history as the man who found the way to stave off extinction and save mankind . That will be my legacy . So , when you stand there and you look at me with that righteous pout of contempt , remember just exactly who the hell you 're talking to . You can go . [ Door opens ] [ Door closes ] The chief of staff has to go . But this time , make sure the target actually dies . Yes , sir . Sorry about that . As for the chief of staff , I 'll take care of it , but I need to point out she still has Secret Service protection . For now . I 'm gonna fire her tomorrow . After that , she 'll just be another civilian walking around the streets of a very dangerous city . So let me get this straight . You 're saying you wouldn 't want my baby anymore ? I 'm saying whatever we 've discussed in the past is no longer relevant , and if I 've caused you any stress , well , then , I am sorry for that . Right . Okay . Well , thank you ... I guess . [ Chuckles ] Perry ... I know you want to be a mother , and I think you would make a great one . But you should withdraw from the lottery . [ Chuckles ] Withdraw ? I know it sounds absurd . What 's your angle ? This is for you . Right . Just trust me , okay ? There are political agendas that might impact the process . S-so you want me to just quit ? Well , I 'm suggesting it , yes ... as a friend . So now we 're friends ? [ Sighs ] [ Chuckles ] I would hope so . I 've [ Chuckles ] never met anybody like you . [ Scoffs ] With all due respect , you and me ... we aren 't friends . [ Doorbell rings ] [ Sighs ] - Hi . - Hi . Uh , I 'm sorry to bother you . Does Alexa Richards still live here ? Uh , no , she doesn 't . Uh ... You don 't happen to know where I could find her , do you ? Alexa Richards doesn 't exist anymore . What do you mean ? She became Alex Richards . You 're ... Alex Richards ? Let me see if I understand . Uh , please ... sit down . You 're saying my eggs might have been viable ? It 's possible . You were inoculated by the same doctor on the same day . The reason you slipped through the cracks is because we assumed all the donors were women . [ Chuckles ] So , the mother of one of the last children would be a father ? That 's what I call irony . [ Both chuckle ] But after your operation , you can no longer produce eggs . Well , that 's true . I mean , not anymore . But I did donate eggs when I was still a woman . Wait ... wait a minute . You donated eggs ? Yeah , right before my transition . That 's the only way I could pay for it . Do they still exist ? As far as I know . Well , you 'd have to ask the George Washington Health Clinic . [ Sighs ] Alex , this could be extraordinary . I hope so . Our lottery countdown coverage continues as the big announcement gets closer . [ Beep ] Say what you want about the lottery ... if you can accept the crazy premise , it 's very addictive . I don 't get how we 're gonna grab Elvis safely . These Department of Humanity guys are gonna be heavily armed , riding in bulletproof vans . E.M.P. gun ... it will take down their vans without bullets . What do we do after we stop the caravan ? We 'll isolate the van with your kid . - Isolate it ? - Yeah . The guys inside of that van , they 're gonna try and stop us from getting Elvis ... that 's their job . According to our intel , the guys in the vans are just drivers ... glorified security guards . Yeah . Glorified security guards with guns . Don 't worry . They 'll roll over . You 'll see . Dan : Well , next time we have a meeting with that clown , I want to be briefed well in advance . Darius . Mr. Vice President . Be there in a minute . I just wanted to say , it 's shocking about General Langdon . So ... do we still have plans for later today ? The specifics have changed , but it still promises to be a very historic day . Darius , I appreciate everything you 've done . I won 't forget it . Thank you , sir . I look forward to working closely with you in the future . Hello , Vanessa . You must be thrilled . Voting 's gonna be completed in about 20 minutes . The world 's gonna change tonight . Yes , it is . But not the way you 'd hoped . You really don 't know me , do you ? President Westwood : Ladies and gentlemen , this is truly an extraordinary moment . Today , we begin a new chapter , a new beginning ... not just for this country , but for all of humanity . The origins of this crisis are not important . What is important , what will be celebrated , is how we came through this crisis , how we persevered against the odds , how our species endured . Our survival will be the greatest story ever told , and we will begin to write it tonight . The votes have all been counted , and we will finally meet the 100 women you have selected ... 100 mothers of the new generation . And so , without further ado , here are the winners . The top vote-getter is Perry Sommers from Brenham , Texas . [ Applause ] [ Laughs ] Thanks . Congratulations , Perry . Thank you , sir . You did it , Perry . The second leading vote-getter ... Noa Glick from Denver , Colorado . [ Applause ] Our next winner is Anna Renner . [ Applause ] [ Man whistles ] [ Hurried footsteps ] Where are you going ? You 're not allowed back here . - I just saw someone . - No one 's allowed back here ... not even the chief of staff . I am telling you , I just saw someone go up those stairs . What you saw was one of our men . Go and check . Yeah . Thank you . D.O.H. vans will be here in five minutes . Hey , tell me something , Kyle . What 's it like ... to have a son ? Nothing really like it . You know , they look at us ... the tall people ... like we actually have some kind of wisdom and we know what the hell 's going on . They don 't know that we 're really just as scared as they are . We 're just trying to make it through all right . I think they know . Eventually , yeah . You know ... my mom said , " there 's a piece of your heart that never opens until you have a kid . " Sounds about right . Maybe one day , I 'll have a daughter . I hope so . President Westwood : And now for our final winner ... Sarah Martina Claire . [ Applause ] [ Man whistles ] - I 'm in position . - Darius : Proceed as planned . [ Cellphone beeps ] Today , we can safely say that we 've honored our Democratic values , and today , we begin a new journey with these 100 women , a journey toward a brighter future , toward the restoration of humanity . Thank you all , and may God bless the United States of America . [ Cheers and applause ] [ Camera shutters clicking ] Stay with me . - I 'm through , Tom . - What are you talking about ? Photographer : Over here ! Over here ! Mr. President , over here ! I know what you 've done . Mr. President , please ... one more picture . Mr. President , over here . One more photo . Hold on a sec . What ... where are you going ? What 's going on with you ? I know everything . W-whatever you think you heard , you don 't know the truth . I know you 're responsible for the fertility crisis . Is there something I 'm missing ? Um ... We 'll talk about this later . No , we 'll talk about it now . Here . Number one is moving out , off schedule . You want an audience ? Can I get a minute , please ? Sir , we have to secure the room . The event is over . Sir , this isn 't protocol . Get out ! I need a minute with my wife ! Get out , all of you ! Go ! Who told you ? So it 's true . You caused the fertility crisis . [ Indistinct conversations ] - Great job . - Hey , thank you . Thank you . Pleasure . Happy ? As a matter of fact , I am . You should be . This will be an unforgettable day . " Will be " ? And you made it happen . 10 years ago , received a secret report . We had reached the tipping point ... the planet could no longer sustain the amount of people living on it . Overpopulation was choking out life as we know it , so we authorized some experiments to regulate fertility , to interrupt reproduction . To make people sterile . Temporarily and selectively . And secretly . Everyone talks about how many people are on the planet , but nobody wanted to stop having babies . So , what ... you thought you 'd make the choice for them ? It wasn 't supposed to happen the way it did . It wasn 't supposed to happen at all . We needed to take a dramatic step . If targeted sterility worked , then so be it . If people couldn 't save themselves ... What ... then you would save them ? [ Scoffs ] Tom , what made you think you could play god ? I didn 't . It was just an experiment . It was never supposed to go online . - It was never supposed to happen . - Well , it happened ! Because a plane crashed and the virus is released and the genie 's let out of the bottle . Oh , my God . And I spent every second since then trying to fix it . Why didn 't you ever tell me ? Because I know how badly you 've wanted to have a baby and you would hate me . [ Smacks lips ] Tom . [ Chuckles ] It was an accident . I swear to you it was an accident . You have to believe me . And I will die trying to make it right . Come here . - I love you more than anything . - Come here . [ Gunshot ] [ Gasps ] Tom ! Oh god . [ Sobbing ] No , Tom , please ! I need an ambulance now . Number one has been shot . No ! [ Screams ] Tom ! [ Latch clicks ] Vanessa : We 'll need to alert the joint chiefs . Go ... now . [ Panting ] Time to move on , Vanessa . - Move on to what ? - A better , safer world . - You 're sick . - There 's nothing you can do about it . You know that . So why not get on board ? The alternative is much worse . Tom . Tom . Dan : Ma 'am . Ma 'am . - Ma 'am , please . - No ! You need to stay with us . [ Sobbing ] [ Panting ] Here they come . Get ready ! Take out the first one . Now ! [ Gun whirs ] [ Tires screech ] Let 's go . [ Engine turns over ] [ Tires screech ] [ Gun clicking ] This will open the lock on the back of the truck . [ Gunfire ] I thought you said these guys were glorified security guards ! I was misinformed ! Aah ! [ Grunts ] Kyle . I got it . I got it . [ Beep ] Rojas ! [ Beeping ] Aah ! [ Panting ] - Elvis : Dad ? - Elvis ! Elvis ! Dad . Dad , I 'm here . [ Panting ] Elvis ? Dad ! [ Machines beeping , whirring ] This might actually work . Dan : I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and will , to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the constitution of the United States . Is there anything I can do ? I can 't believe it . I can only imagine what you 're going through now . Let 's dispense with the hollow concern , shall we ? [ Sighs ] We did what we did . And now he 's dead . Just make sure you deliver . One embryo . You have my word . I don 't want your word , Darius . I want a baby . [ Groans ] Alison : Sorry . [ Groaning ] - Is that better ? - Yeah , a little . Al , listen , I appreciate what you 're doing here , but [ Sighs ] you really ought to get going . Why ? The emperor is dead . [ Strained ] The forces of evil are gathering power . The good people must go away to fight another day . [ Sighs ] It 's " Star Wars . " - I figured . - Yeah . No , but , seriously , what 's your plan ? [ Sighs ] I think I 'm gonna stay in D.C. Stay in D.C. for ... for what ? So I can help you . Okay , Al , I don 't know if you noticed this , but there 's , like , a whole hospital full of doctors here who can help me get better . [ Sighs ] - You got shot because of me . - Because of you ? I got shot because I was looking for the truth . It was my decision . And you know what ? I would make it again . [ Chuckling ] Yeah . Because you survived . [ Sighs ] Yeah , I survived . Now you got to do the same . It 's not gonna be safe for you here . What about you ? I 'm not the one they care about . Go . [ Sighs shakily ] All right , then . I guess this is it . [ Sighs ] Wait . Hold on . I wanted to ask you something . Was there anything useful on that flash drive I got for you ? Yes . As a matter of fact , there was . It 's official ... the Department of Humanity now has complete control and authority over the lottery winners and embryos . I have complete confidence and faith in your ability to do the right thing here , Darius . Thank you , Mr. President . I 'll ... try to do my best . [ Sighs ] What 's the best way to handle this ? Handle what ? The lottery winners . How do we tell them that they 're not going home ... that they 're gonna be sequestered in a facility in South Carolina for the next two years and that their babies will be the property of the United States government ? We don 't . We just do it . Thank God you made it . My car is back there . Where 's your bag ? I came to tell you I 'm not coming . What do you mean ? I can 't . Vanessa , you can 't stay here ... not with the enemies you 've made . You don 't think Darius is gonna come after you ? And what would you have me do ? Run away to some island ? Maybe . Maybe Canada . Anyplace but here . You can start over . I 'll be all right . Take care of yourself . And good luck . You too . [ Gabriel Fauré 's " In Paradisum " plays ] This way ladies , please . Everyone on the bus . Where are they taking us ? This way . Just go , just go . What happened to the bullet ? It went right through me . Did it hurt ? [ Chuckles ] Yeah . [ Car door closes ] Alison ! Hey . You made it . [ Sighs ] Yeah . Not easy to find , but I guess that was the point . Can I sit in the front seat ? No . Backseat , seat belt . Go . There 's something I need to tell you . Yeah . What 's up ? I [ Sighs ] was able to fertilize another egg . You serious ? Yes . It 's in the car . What ... like , in your purse ? [ Chuckles ] In a mini cryogenic unit . That 's amazing news . It gets better . I used your sperm to fertilize the egg . My sperm ? It worked ? Like a charm .

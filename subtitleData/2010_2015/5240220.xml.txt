 Previously on Alphas ... You 're Alpha secret agents . You want me on your team . I 'm awesome . What 's all this ? Doctor Rosen said that I should find a way to scream without terrifying you , so I did . I 'm moving out . I 'm gonna go live at my office . Do you like Italian ? Look , Rachel , if we 're going to be working together ... Right . Forget I mentioned it . Nina , your life is out of control . No pushing unless absolutely necessary . I 'm done . You 're what ? I 'm done . Why don 't you get the hell out ? That 's what you always wanted . Believe me , nothing would make me happier ! You never wanted to be here ! Is that the best you can do ? Run away ? Go ahead . Get the hell out . Abandon your family . We don 't want you anyway . No , no ! Daddy ! Please don 't go ! Nina , sweetie , I 'm sorry . I 'll call you soon . I promise . No , you can 't leave . Sweetie . You can 't leave . I can 't leave . I can 't leave . I love you , Daddy . Hey , this trip down memory lane is killing my buzz . Let 's go have some fun . Let 's go , babe . Come on . Let 's go ! Hush , little baby , don 't say a word Papa 's gonna buy you a mockingbird And if that mockingbird won 't sing Papa 's gonna buy you a diamond ring Mr. Lewis ? The alarm went off . Shh . It 's gonna be okay . I 'm bringing her back to her mother . Sir , you better let me see that . No ! Sir , you need to hand that over now . Give her back ! Mr. Lewis , give me that ! Don 't hurt baby . Baby ? Please . What ... What baby ? Don 't take no for an answer There 's no telling where we 've been Because people don 't understand , understand , understand People don 't understand People like me John said he didn 't want to have dinner because we work together , but when he said it , his heart rate went up , and his pupils dilated . Wait , you lie-detected the guy with your ability just because he turned you down for a date ? Maybe . Yes . Maybe ? Don 't judge me . Rachel , you can 't do that . I 'm a freak . Yeah . It 's ' cause of my ability , right ? No . You are a freak for a million different reasons . Ho-ho . What ? We have rules , right ? No cursing me out in foreign languages . I didn 't agree to any of these rules . Don 't look at me . I 'm not ready yet . Gary ? Gary , what the hell are you doing ? Gary ! Gary ! What the hell are you doing ? Gary ? Don 't , no . Guys , hold on . Gary , why aren 't you dressed ? Yeah , I know . I should be dressed by now . But the alarm clock didn 't go off . This is a cheap alarm clock . I 'm supposed to get up at 7 : 42 . I call my mom at 8 : 00 , then I have my breakfast . It didn 't happen . Bill , it 's 9 : 03 . Gary . This is chaos . Gary . Why are you taking a shower in the office ? Oh , Dr. Rosen said that I could stay here till I find an apartment . But ... Is that my blanket ? Yeah . There 's hair and skin on my blanket . Gary , were you naked on my blanket ? Yeah , because this gets sticky . This is all sticky on my skin . And Dr. Rosen said that I should make myself comfortable . Come on , guys , get out . This is inappropriate . You 're right , this is definitely inappropriate . I 'm gonna have to take off my towel . No , no , don 't , Gary ... And you 're gonna see my fruit . No ! His fruit . Yeah , I call it my fruit . - Gary ... - Uh , morning . Hey . Casual Mondays ? No , I took a shower . Get out . Excuse me . Unless , of course , you want to see his fruit . No , no , I 'll pass . I got to talk to Dr. Rosen , so ... Welcome to the party , son . Rosen 's in with Kat . What 's up ? And bolt . Bolt . Data port . Data port . Done . Two carburetors in less than a minute . Very impressive . Yep ! I watched the video . Yeah , once ... Yesterday . Your neurons must myelinate at an astounding rate . Oh , sorry . It 's commonly called muscle memory . Ah . Which might explain why you can almost instantly acquire complex physical skills that normally would take years to master . Yeah , well , all I know is I can do a bunch of stuff , but I just can 't remember how I learned it . Yes , that does seem to be the tradeoff , doesn 't it ? Rapid learning at the cost of long-term memory . What 's most intriguing is how you retain the skills in your muscle memory even if the experience of learning is completely forgotten . So ... Basic electronics , various martial arts , violin and now you can add motorcycle mechanic to the list . So ... When do we get to do the cool stuff ? You know , like track a perp , shoot a gun , rappel out of a helicopter ? Well , fortunately , none of us have had to jump out of a helicopter yet . Come on , Doc . I got , like , six weeks of memory , max . So , technically , I 've spent a third of my life auditioning for you . Kat , you 're not auditioning . I 'm trying to help you . It 's my hope we can find a way of counteracting your memory loss . Counteract it ? Why would I want to do that ? I like it the way it is , no rearview mirror . Well , wouldn 't you like to at least know what your favorite song is ? Or was ? Are you serious ? Yes . Almost every one of these albums takes me back to a specific moment in my life , so , whenever I play one , I 'm flooded with all sorts of memories . I guess you could say I 'm reliving my personal history . Excuse me , Dr. Rosen . Um , we got another one for you . Uh , I 'll be right there , John . Thanks . All right , so , Kat , I want you to have this . This takes video . Really ? What do you want me to record ? Whatever you want . Start collecting your memories . We 'll talk some more about this in our next session . Okay . Robert Lewis ... Branch manager of the Liberty Citizen Bank over on 43rd ... He tried to steal 500 grand from his own bank . Claimed he was saving a baby . We got him in the MRI room now . Same symptoms as all the others ... Hallucination and confusion . Two jewelry stores , that state trooper , and now a bank , all within 72 hours . It 's got to be an Alpha , right ? What are you saying ? You saying Nina pushed this guy ? I 'm just saying that Mr. Lewis ' MRI results are consistent with her ability . The robbery took over an hour . Nina 's ability doesn 't last that long . Unless she 's increased the intensity and duration of her inductions , which she could do . Yeah , when we were together , uh , near the end , she pushed me once . Now , I lost half a day . She said it was an accident . For her own safety , we need to bring her in . " For her own safety " ? Rachel , the government fears Nina . They always have . And if and when they find out about this , guilty or not , she 'll be a suspect . And I think we all know what the government does to Alphas when they get scared . Does Cley know ? Not yet . And I 'm gonna do my best to keep it off his radar for another day or two . So how do we even find her ? Gary said her phone 's been dead for over a week . Well , uh , will you work with Gary , then ? And see if you can compile a list of the places that she frequents and then go over them one by one . Yeah . I 'm gonna go get on that . Ahem . Doc , maybe you want to let Bill take point on this , okay ? I don 't think Nina 's gonna want to see me . Despite what you believe , Cameron , she trusts you . What if she doesn 't want to come in ? I think we both know Nina doesn 't do anything she doesn 't want to do . Bring her in , whatever it takes . John ? Look ... I 'm smart and kind of cute . I 'm nice . And if you don 't want to go out with me , I totally get it , but ... At least have the decency to give me the real reason . We work together , like I said . Yeah , you see , your heart rate is up , and you 're sweating . It was a lie then , and it 's a lie now , so ... It 's not you . Really ? That 's all you got ? Enjoy your eggs . Rachel , wait . Okay , I 'm waiting . I don 't talk about this ... Ever . Two years ago , I was deployed in Kandahar province . Our convoy ... It was hit by an IED . My Stryker caught on fire . I got out , but not fast enough . Oh , God . Wow . Oh , no , I 'm sorry . I ... No , it ... No , John . No , no , it 's okay . I think I 'll go out for breakfast . Are you okay ? Come on , let 's go find Nina . It 's the next place on the list . Why can 't Nina ever go anyplace quiet ? Nina dragged me here a couple times , but it was never crazy like this . You don 't even want to know what I 'm smelling . Clive Christian perfume ... It might be Nina . All right , let 's split up and look around . Hey , hey , you find her , you come get me , okay ? Okay . All right . Oh , excuse me . Oh , excuse me . Nina . Hey , Rach . Hello , beautiful . You lost ? No , I 'm not . What are you doing here ? Dr. Rosen needs to see you , Nina . Come on , let 's go . Yeah , well , I don 't want to see him . We gotta go . And if you know what 's good for you , Rach , you 'll leave before you get hurt . Rachel ... You 're that senses girl , right ? Cool . How do you know who I am ? Nina , who is this guy ? Is it true you can actually get off by someone kissing you ? - You told him that ? - No , relax . No judgment here . Nothing to be ashamed of . You know , he 's right . You need to learn how to enjoy what you can do , what makes you special . In fact ... You want to kiss me ... Right now . Yeah , I do . Nina , what the hell are you doing ? Rach , hey ! I 'm just helping Rachel have some fun . Just let the girls enjoy ... Shut up . Take it easy . Rachel ! That 's nice , Rachel . You can stop now . Hicks . Let him go . You know I don 't need to ask . Whoo . Whoo . Whoo . Ooh ! Sorry , honey . Oh , Hicks , right ? Nina told me all about you . She 's right . You are uptight . But , hey , I used to be the same way , and now life is good , and I 'm just enjoying the ride . So it was you that tried to rob the bank , huh ? Girl needs a little pocket money . No , this isn 't you , Nina . You know me so well , right ? Hicks , you have no idea . You never did . With Tommy , I don 't have to pretend . He makes me happy . What did you do to me ? I did warn you , Rachel . Look , we 're here to help you . She doesn 't need your help . No , Hicks . Hicks ! Put me down , okay ! She 's getting away . Hicks ! Hicks , put me down . Come on , let me down . We gotta go ! Hicks , snap out of it ! Oh . Wait . Where 'd she go ? She 's gone . A little reality . All right , what did you give me this time , Doc ? Risperidone . It helps ameliorate the effects of an induction . Oh , this is just as I feared . Her ability has grown significantly , so her pushes are gonna last that much longer . Are you all right ? I 'm great . Rachel , would you ask Gary to join us , please ? I still cannot believe that Nina did that to Rachel . I mean , she knows how sensitive that woman is . I mean , that 's just cold . Okay , who 's the guy ? Ahem . Well , Nina mentioned a " Tommy " a few times in her therapy . Now , if it 's the same Tommy , he was her first boyfriend . He was pretty important to her at a younger age . And obviously not a very good influence . And the bad ex-boyfriend defense is no defense . There 's no excuse . Listen , we , uh ... We need to think of Nina as ... As an addict now . The more she uses her ability , the more she needs it . The more she needs it , the more she uses it to make herself feel better and the more powerless she is to control it . So , we have to get back out there to find her again . Look , Cley knows we 're working on the bank robbery , okay ? Look , he 's already asking for MRI results on Lewis . Well , I hope you told him the situation 's under control . I lied spectacularly , but that doesn 't mean that we have to ... The clock is ticking . All right , we get it . Hey , hey , hey . We need to lock Nina up . Her office is my man cave , unless she starts using another office , then she doesn 't have to go to jail . Thank you , Gary . Listen , Tommy is still our best lead , right ? So , Gary , I need you to check all high-school yearbooks from Greenwich , Connecticut - from what , year 1990 ... - ' 95 . No , no , Greenwich . No . Yeah , Greenwich , Connecticut . Gary , it 's North Shore , Long Island . Gary ... What are you talking about ? Pull all the yearbooks from all the high schools in Castle Hill . The Bronx . Nina tends to embellish her past . Pushing me like that ! I am not pushing ! I 'm just asking for more ! All you ever do is you push and push ! I 'm just asking for a little more ! I can 't stand it here anymore ! Sorry . Just cutting through . Whatever . You should hear my parents go at it . Way louder . Good for you . I 'm Tommy . I just moved into 286 . Nina . Cool . Like Nina Simone ? I know you 're having a blast listening to your parents fight , but you want to maybe go for a slice ? I can 't . I gotta keep an eye out . Sometimes their fights get a little crazy . Well , then why don 't I go grab a couple slices , bring ' em back ? Yeah , sure . A slice sounds good . Nina Simone . Hot chocolate , extra whip , little bit of cinnamon ... Just the way you like it . What 's wrong ? Nothing . I 'm fine . Don 't let what happened at the club rattle you . Trust me , everything 's gonna be okay . I know . You 're not very convincing . I just ... I think I screwed up . Hey , I love you . You know that , right ? I love you too . I don 't know where Tommy is , and I don 't want to . He never cared about us . He wasn 't happy . He wanted to go , so I let him go . And Lucas and I ... we are better off without him . Is there anyone else you 'd think he 'd contact ... Family , friends ? He 's gone . That 's all I care about . We are better off without him . Okay , we get it . If you think of anything else , here 's my card . Give me a call . Department of Defense . Whatever . Put it back , kid . Come on , you can 't be cool ? It 's just a beer . Get out before I call the cops . Come on , Nina . Let 's go . You can sell me the beer . I 'm 21 . Girls have it so easy . All you got to do is smile , and you get what you want . No , that 's not it . Why else do you think he sold it to you ? I can control people ... Like , I don 't know , in vampire movies ? Look into my eyes . All that ? Yeah . Here , hold my beer . Hey . Stand on one foot . Jump up and down . Stop . You can go now . It only lasts a couple of minutes . That was awesome . It 's beautiful here . Pizza at sea , classic combination . Mmm-hmm . Do you have any red pepper on board ? No , sir . I 'm sorry . Oh , steward , bring us some red pepper . That never stops being amazing . You know what we should do ? This . Just sail away . Sail away where ? Wherever . We 'll sail around the world , maybe . Who cares ? Well , I don 't know anything about boats and neither do you . No , I do . Couple of summers I worked at the Baywood Marina . That 's where I met Becky . Oh , hey , you know what ? Just forget Becky . Let 's just sail away to Bermuda and get married . You serious ? Yeah . I mean , we 'll , we 'll have to get a sailboat and then get it ready . But then , you know , we 'll go to Bermuda , and it 'll be a permanent honeymoon . No one will ever bother us again . It sounds nice , but ... Rosen will never stop looking for me . You 're gonna let one guy stand between us and our dreams ? You can fix this . You can fix anything . Last week we started to talk about your father . Would you like to continue that ? Would you like me to make you jam that pen in your eye ? Nina , I 'm on your side . And remember , you came here for my help . It was either you or jail . Hey , Doc . What is going on ? What 's happening ? It 's a little early for our session , Kat . What is the deal , huh ? I 've been talking to this stupid phone for two days now , and you are in your own world . I 'm not feeling the love . Would you like to say anything about that ? I 'm sorry , Kat . I 've been preoccupied . Nina , right ? It 's cool . Gary told me she 's been off the rez . Gary told you what ? Don 't worry about it . I 'm gonna keep it on the DL . Not for government ears . Yes , I 'd hope you appreciate that fact . If for no other reason than Nina 's sake . She 's , um ... She 's a bit troubled these days . You 're the one who looks troubled to me . Do you want to talk about it ? Uh , no , thank you , but I appreciate your concerns . That 's interesting , ' cause I have to spill my guts to you , but you get a free pass . That doesn 't seem very fair , does it ? Ahem . Sharing is good . I mean , that 's what you 're always saying , right ? May I see that ? Ahem . Yes . Hey , Kat , the reason I 'm taking it relatively slow with you is because I don 't want to overlook anything . And there have been times in my past when , frankly , my passions have overtaken my practice , and I wouldn 't want that to happen ... For either of us . Okay . Fair enough ? Yeah . But what 's going on with Nina , you shouldn 't put that all on yourself . She 's a big girl . Am I interrupting something ? Yeah , just one second . Yeah , so I 'll get that to you right away . Thank you , Kat . Yeah . Nice tie . Ahem . You weren 't returning my calls . I 'm sorry , Nathan . I 've been exceedingly busy . The attempted robbery at Liberty Citizen ... Any progress finding the Alpha responsible ? Uh , we 're working on it . Anything I can do to help ? Uh , no , no , not at the moment . Thanks . Um , anything else ? Oversight committee is asking for updates on the Building Seven escapees . Our highest priority . I 'll have the files downloaded for you in a day or two . A day . You got a day , Lee . Nathan , I realize that , but there are only so many hours in the day . No , you don 't need to drag the oversight committee into this . Listen , you 'll have your reports by the end of the day tomorrow . Doc , we got a lead on Nina . Cameron , I 'm not sure we can proceed with the whole thing . Oh , no , it 's a good one . Yesterday they found a man swimming in Long Island Sound in his clothes , and he had hypothermia , and he almost drowned , and he kept trying to get back into the water , and he couldn 't even say why , and then ... Oh , and he had red pepper in his pockets . Yeah , it 's okay to laugh , 'cause ... 'Cause he didn 't die . This guy works on a yacht anchored off Oyster Bay . Oh , Hicks , come on , I was gonna say that next . Okay , I 'm sorry . Thank you , both of you . But I 'm afraid we 're gonna have to put that investigation on hold . Orders from upstairs . We need to go through the Building Seven escapees again , so , uh , all hands ... No , we can 't just drop this . Orders from upstairs , Cameron . I got the water cooler and the ever-important break room , snacks . There he is . Harken , the muscle of the outfit . Although I kicked his ass at the Alpha fights , which is interesting . All right , since you 're filming this , get the facts straight , right ? Whatever . That 's not how it happened . You are such a sore loser . There is someone here to see you . Who 's that ? Seems real confused . Her name 's Becky . She 's out front . Oh , thank you . Uh-huh . I 'm number one . I 'm the winner ... Number one . Hey , how 's it going ? After you left , I was ... Thinking about what I said ... You know , that I never wanted to see Tommy again , and ... It didn 't make sense . Tommy and me , we had our problems , but we were making it work for Lucas . I didn 't want him to go . I didn 't . I could hear Becky 's heart racing every time she tried to remember what happened to her . Obviously , Nina pushed her . If we 're lucky , Nina may still be in Oyster Bay . Listen , I think I 've been more than clear about this . We need to be focused on the Building Seven escapees . What ? Doc , Nina needs us . And I need you to be focused . It 's orders from upstairs . Doc , what the hell are you talking about ? Uh , listen . It 's ... Oh , he 's been pushed . What ? What ? Dr. Rosen , you 've been pushed . Hello , Lee . Oh , no . What if we get caught ? Come on , Nina . It 's Pearl Jam . You can get us backstage . Uh ... Dad , why aren 't you at work ? I tried to go , but I couldn 't leave . I 'm not supposed to leave . Oh , my head hurts . Is he okay ? Yeah , he ... He 's fine . Um , Dad , you can go to work whenever you want . Just come back when you 're done , okay ? Right . I come back when I 'm finished . Mmm-hmm . Thanks , sweetheart . Go , Dad . Hey , Tommy . How 's it going ? Good . Thanks . Good . What the hell was that ? Nothing . Tommy ... All these docks look the same to me , so , uh , give me a shout and tell me where the boat 's parked or whatever . Oh , no . It 's Clive Christian perfume . You see her ? No . All right . Nina told me all about you , Lee . You only care about her ability , and you only want her around when you need something . So the party at the club and the yacht ... That wasn 't exploiting her ability ? It was all just for her ? I love Nina . I always have . More than your wife and son ? I never wanted that life . All I want is to make Nina happy . Well , if you care so much about her , then perhaps you 'll help us find her . She 's in serious trouble . Seems to me she 's only in trouble if you find her . Well , perhaps there 's someone else who can convince you . Want to see your daddy ? Daddy ! Hey , little man . Here we go , coffee , black , for me and chamomile tea for the lady . Ah , that never gets old , does it ? What the hell 's going on in there ? He 's been in there for over an hour . We wouldn 't even be here if you didn 't bang that guy 's head against the cabinet . He tripped . Yeah . Mostly . Right , right . Which one of you is Harken ? Hmm ? I need some help with my incident report out at my cruiser . That 's Harken . Thanks a lot , Hicks . You want to help me . This is so far beyond what Nina 's ever done . Oh , Nina does whatever she wants . Don 't move , either one of you . Thanks , Cam . Wait here . Sure . What are you doing , Nina ? You 've gone crazy . Shut up . Nina . Just go outside , please . Nina , you don 't have to push me . I 'm not gonna try and stop you . Will you please just have Cameron put the gun down ? No one needs to get hurt here . Put the gun down . Hey , Tommy . Let 's go . We 're gonna get you out of here . Nina , how could you do this to me ? No , I know . I know . I know . I never should have let them arrest you , but ... I 'm here now . Nina , there 's no relationship here . It 's not real . You 've been pushing Tommy the whole time . No , but ... You weren 't happy with them . You want to be with me . You love me . No , I don 't . You know that . Hey , Tommy . Nina . I told you to stay away from me . Listen , I 've been thinking . We should tell someone about what you can do . What you 're doing to your dad ... It 's not right . Okay . I know all this is hard for you to understand , but I 'm helping him . No , you 're not . The guy is severely messed up . No , he 's ... He 's fine , and he 's happy . If you don 't tell someone about this , I will . No , you won 't . I won 't let you . Oh , no . Tommy , I 'm sorry . You know I wouldn 't do that . You know , I wouldn 't do that to you . Tommy , look at ... Look at me ! Stay away from me . Tommy , look at me ! Bill , John , take it easy . Cam , help . Cameron , no ! Bill , Bill , go . I 'll see to him . John . John , you all right ? The vest caught the bullet . I 'm fine . Go after Nina . I 'm fine . Move ! Come on . Stop ! Come on . Lock the exits ! I 'll take the roof . All right . Go ! What the hell ? Next one 's at your head , Bill . Hicks , come on , snap out of it . Come on , man . Doc , careful . Nina ! Nina , it 's Lee ! I want to talk with you . Please , that 's all . I just ... I just want to talk with you for a moment . Hicks ... Let Rosen through , but only him . Just you , Rosen . Yeah , I got him . It 's quite a remarkable view , isn 't it ? What do you want to do , Nina ? Tommy and I were gonna sail away together ... Just the two of us . When we were kids , he made me so happy . You 're happy . This is everything you 've always wanted . He really loved me . I know . Nina , I understand that ... That you 're feeling very much alone right now , so you pushed Tommy , hoping to fill the void . You want him to be that teenage boy again , the one who cared for you and the one who made you happy . I understand . Yeah , but look what I did to him . I pushed him just like I pushed my dad . You can 't leave . Oh , Nina . That was not your fault . He wanted to leave , and I wouldn 't let him . You know , Tommy was right . You were a child then . Of course you didn 't want your father to leave . What child does ? I wouldn 't let him go . No ! Daddy ! I 'm tired of hurting people . Nina ... Cameron . You 're free . Do whatever you want . Thank you , Nina . Bill . I 'm sorry ... Nina , no ! For everything . I 'm sorry . - For everything . - Nina , no ! No ! Let me go . No ! No , Hicks , you 're slipping . Let me go . Hold on ! Hold on . God . Come on , girl , I got you . Good morning , Kat . Hey , Gary . The guy 's turned into a fricking rooster . Day doesn 't start until Gary 's crowing . It 's therapeutic . I get it . Hey , so , uh , is Nina gonna be okay ? I don 't know . Her past seems pretty messed up . Makes me wonder , if I keep working with Rosen , what I 'm gonna find . It 's not all bad stuff , you know . It can be some good stuff too . Yeah , I guess . Look , I remember when , uh , my wife , Jeannie ... I picked her up to go to junior prom , and it was a setup , so I 'm sweating through my tux , and then here she comes in this purple dress , and ... It was ... It was over for me then . And those are the memories that can last a man a lifetime . Well , I 'm betting I didn 't go to prom with Jeannie . What if I don 't have a memory like that ? Well , you won 't know until you try . Look , one good memory is worth all the bad ones . Like the time I kicked your ass ... Remember that ? Yep . That 's not a memory . It 's made up . It 's head trauma . I 've seen all good people turn their heads Each day so satisfied I 'm on my way Shouldn 't you be in the hospital ? Oh , it 's just a bruised rib . Mmm . I 'm really sorry about your friend . Yeah , I wouldn 't call her my friend anymore , but thanks . You know , getting shot always makes me really hungry . I was gonna head out to , uh ... To a coffee shop . You want to join me ? Are you asking me out on a date ? Breakfast doesn 't really count . Oh . I didn 't know that . Yeah . Look , um , Rachel ... About before , I was the one who overreacted . Your vision , how it works ... I get it . But you 're not the only one who 's sensitive . The idea of being touched ... I haven 't been with anyone since my injury . So , if we want to try this , we 're gonna need to take it slow . Slow is good . Good . You worked out a pretty sweet deal for Nina ... Released into your custody , no charges . Nina 's valuable . Yeah . You 're lucky she didn 't kill somebody . You should 've let me in . Nathan , I couldn 't take that chance . This is the last freebie you get . Next time you shut me out , I 'm throwing your ass under the bus . And its news is captured For the queen to use Diddit , diddit , diddit , diddit Diddit , diddit , diddit , didda How is she ? Uh , it 's hard to tell . You know all that stuff with her dad ? She never told me . How do you even begin to get past something like that ? With a great deal of help . Nina , it 's Lee . I 'm sorry about these ... These restraints . It 's , uh ... It 's okay . I 'm dangerous . No , don 't , okay ? You can 't trust me . Look at me . Hi . Diddit , diddit , diddit , diddit Diddit , diddit , diddit , didda Diddit , diddit , diddit , diddit Diddit , diddit , diddit , didda For the queen to use 'Cause it 's time , it 's time in time with your time And its news is captured

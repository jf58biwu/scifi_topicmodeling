 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Using the astrolabe unleashes a formidable evil that has to be eradicated . Now will you help me , Arthur ? Of course . The metronome is for Steve . I 'm bringing him back . Agent Jinks is linked to the metronome . We do not yet know the downside of this artifact . Oh , ow ! Oh , they got me . - I don 't see anything . - God , I can feel it . Where 's Artemis ? No , no , you just ... Finally . You told us to meet you here 30 minutes ago . You 're never late . Are you okay ? I told them you probably got hung up yelling at kids to get off your lawn . Yeah , or maybe you were busy inventing fire . You know , from caveman times . I 'm not allowed to do those , am I ? No . I got a message from Hugo Miller . - Oh , huey ! - Oh , how is he ? Oh , he 's ... he 's still irritating . And he 's scattered . But I managed to piece together that he 's found an artifact . We 're gonna have to go retrieve it . So , Pete , I 'm gonna be sending you and Claudia . What ? But I partner with Steve . I mean , I did just bring him back from the dead , so I kinda own him now . No offense , Pete . - Nah . - No offense , Pete ? You are going with Pete . This is a job . This is not a choose your own adventure book . Ooh , why don 't you come here , you ... All right , Steve , you and Myka , you 're gonna go to new Orleans . You 're gonna talk to a Dr. Nina Golden . She 's a therapist . Apparently , a bunch of her patients have been cured overnight . Well , maybe she 's just a good therapist . No , no , these people have severe issues ... P.T.S.D. , grief , paralyzing phobias . And literally overnight , these issues have disappeared . It 's been going on for three months . So we are gonna stop an artifact that helps troubled people become well ? Yes , you are . What do we know about artifacts ? Any artifact , even the ones that apparently are just doing good ? Yes , we 've got it . We 're on it . - Good . - Great . Everybody go away . Pete , Pete . Aah-aah , manhandling , Artie , manhandling . I want you to keep an eye on Claudia . What ... why , what 's wrong ? Is she okay ? No , no , she 's fine . She 's just been through a lot . And I just wanna make sure that she 's not under too much stress . Oh , all right , okay . Sure , of course . Good . Bye . Okay . It is such a treat to have visitors . You know , I-I 've been a nomad for the last couple of years , and I finally decided to quit fighting it and come back to my old pad , my home sweet home . Yeah , I love what you 've done with all the ... the beige . Yeah . Sit . Sit . So , Hugo , do you , uh ... Do you have something for us ? I thought you 'd never ask . Take a look at these little beauties . This , my friend , is a bag or marbles once owned by a young Bobby Fischer . Huh ? Just one of these little cuties gives the holder intense focus and a powerful drive to achieve any goal he sets . Cool . However , prolonged exposure can lead to violence ... Uh , less cool . And ultimately insanity and / or stroke . I searched for them back in the ' 70s , but I was never able to find ' em . And then I was , uh , waylaid by the warehouse computer system . - So how 'd you get ' em ? - Fedex . Well , that 's weird . Whoever sent these must have known these little beauties were way up on my most wanted list . Uncle huey . Hey ! Here he is . - Agents Donovan and Lattimer ... - Hey . This is my one and only nephew Brady . Very nice to meet you both . Brady 's staying with me while he attends the Tilson academy , my alma mater . Brady here got hold of the bag of marbles , which I left on my desk , and , uh , research papers , and he took them with him to school , the little devil . I just got curious . Curious . Did you hear that ? I mean , bad , Brady , bad . Tilson 's competitive . Especially this week , there 's even more pressure 'cause of the I.M.T. Oh , right . The I.M.T. , the international monkey ... interschool multidiscipline tournament . - Like Hogwarts . - Oh , cool . Less cool . See , unfortunately , it 's all tied up with alumni support . So the parents and the faculty tend to push the kids a bit hard . It 's down to us and north lake prep , our crosstown rivals . We hate them . So , Brady , you wanted the marble to focus you , to give you an extra boost ? Yeah , yeah . I mean , I used one to write my paper for the I.M.T. computer engineering event . Wrote it in , like , 20 minutes . It was awesome . But he ... he brought them right back before anything bad happened . Well , actually , uncle Hugo , there is kind of a problem . I mean , uh , well , I thought it would ... I thought it would go away , but it 's just getting worse . ♪ ♪ finished my latest tour in Afghanistan six weeks ago . I 'm a helicopter pilot . And you started seeing Dr. Golden as soon as you got back ? Alex suffered from P.T.S.D. He was shell-shocked and withdrawn , and we hadn 't even gotten to the core issues . And then yesterday , his symptoms were simply gone . Is it possible that you ... Well , you 're just having a good day ? Except I don 't even remember being P.T.S.D. No , I 've seen similar responses in several patients over the last three months . And I 'm worried . Proper healing takes time . Is there any connection between the patients ? Any of them related , live in the same neighborhood ? No , they 're not even suffering from the same traumas . A young Katrina widow , a child recovering from an accident , and Alex 's war experience . They 're all completely over it . Well , it 's a good thing we 're here to stop that from happening . Steve . And you 're from the government ? I mean , it 's fine . It just seems odd that the federal government ... Uh , health and human services . We 're here collecting data . We ... we love numbers . Uh , have you gotten any unusual objects in the office recently ? Hm , objects ? No , I-I don 't think so . Why ? We 'll need to see your files and your patient reports . You can black out the names for confidentiality . But we 're here to help you find a link . Of course . Arthur . - Hello . - Brother Adrian . I ... look , this isn 't a good time . And I have not found anything yet to help you locate the astrolabe . But I promise you ... Exactly why I 'm here . I believe I found something to help us discover just who stole it . Great . Brady , you shoulda told me about this . Well , it just started happening . All right , well , we 're gonna fix this right now . Just stand back . Prepare to be wowed . Wow . It 's usually much " wowier " than that . No reaction . - Kid , let me see your arm . - Yeah . No change . What have we missed ? Well , I mean , I might have ... Loaned a marble to a kid named Tommy ? Bunch of cell phone videos in your friend feed . A rather scrawny Tommy is currently in the process of beating the crap out of a much larger Slytherin . Brady , you loaned out one of the marbles ? Actually , I might have loaned out four of them . I know that boy . He 's a good kid . It 's only fair to lend out the marbles . I didn 't wanna be selfish . Which would be admirable if you were sharing a bag of chips , or passing around a joint at a concert . Which would be really bad . That would be terrible . What uncle huey means is that artifacts are always dangerous . Why don 't you wait in there while I do my work out here ? Good idea . Hey . All right , Tommy , show ' em . Go ahead , show ' em what you showed me . Brady said the marble would just help me focus on my goals . You 're not gonna call my parents , are you ? No , just next time try a red bull . Well , I don 't get it . Was beating up that kid one of your goals ? No , but I had to get onto the I.M.T. calculus team , and there was only one spot left . So that gigantor is a calculus expert ? All right . Look , we , uh ... we 're gonna need that marble back now . Fine . Agent Lattimer , thank you for waiting . I 'm still not sure why the secret service cares about ... Uh , school violence . Yeah , the president 's made it one of his top priorities this year . I 'm in trouble , aren 't I ? Tommy , pulling this during I.M.T. week ? Thanks to the absurd budget cuts our esteemed school board is making , we 're all under pressure to generate more alumni support . The atmosphere 's already fraught with tension . The board must see I.M.T. as a success . I have to enforce a zero tolerance policy . I 'm sorry . Great . Hear that ? The atmosphere 's fraught with tension . Yeah , throw in some violent , deadly marbles and Harry Potter becomes full metal jacket . There 's nothing here except a lot of seriously depressing stories . Hey , uh , Steve . You know , I know what it 's like coming back after being away . So if you ever wanna talk ... Kinda different circumstances though , wouldn 't you say ? Yes , it is . But still , talking 's talking . I 'm good . Really , I am fine . Really ? It 's ironic , you know ? The guy who can see lies is actually a terrible liar . You know , Pete warned me about this . He said if you started talking about feelings that I should just change the subject . Really ? Like Pete has feelings . You don 't wanna talk about it . That 's ... that 's fine . You 're right . There is nothing in here . Steve . Steve , come look at this . It 's a jazz club right down the street . " The altered scale . " Does the logo look familiar ? Alex had it on his t-shirt , so we know that he 's been there . Well , given how close the bar is , and how any patient who 's been here would 've seen it ... Well , maybe we should talk to them and find out if any other patients like jazz and free drinks . I know I do . Here 's a list of the other three guys . What if they turn violent like Tommy did ? Hey , don 't worry about it . You 're gonna be celebrating in no time . Hey , brade-ster , you probably know their schedules , right ? So let 's figure out what classes - your pals are in right now . - You okay ? Yeah , yeah . I just ... I 'm ... I was careless with an artifact again . And now my nephew is in trouble . Hey , it 's all right , accidents happens . Don 't beat yourself up about it . You can just get Tommy to do that . Yeah . Okay , guys , let 's split up , and get us some marbles . - Come on , we 'll fix this . - Right . So what do you think , home in time for dinner ? It used to belong to some old sheriff I think . Jack Duncan , the most successful bounty hunter in new Mexico , not some old sheriff . Details , specifics , they matter . That 's how we understand what these artifacts actually do . Of course , of course . It 's fascinating . Well , from what I 've learned , this spur can help us track the movement of the missing astrolabe ... The way a ... the way a bounty hunter tracks a person . That 's ... that 's quite good . Yes , isn 't it ? Unfortunately , the regents , they ... They 're our board of directors and they 're rather strict . And warehouse agents aren 't allowed to actually use these artifacts . Understandable . However , given the danger of the astrolabe , isn 't it in all of our interests , your organization and mine , to retrieve it by any means necessary ? It would take a tremendous amount of digging into how this spur actually works to know what the potential downsides are . See , we don 't just rush into these things without a huge amount of ... Research . Mm-hmm . These are my findings . - You have findings . - Yes , I do . Histories of the spur 's use , plus anecdotal evidence showing minimal downside . Horses will be afraid of you for a couple of days . Do you ride horses ? What a relief . So now you 're free to show me how all of this works . Ahh , this is exciting , isn 't it ? Yes , let 's use that word . Oh , my God . Will you look at this place ? Can you goo a whole building ? It could be any of these things . Well , whatever it is , we need to be careful . None of the patients can remember exactly what happened to them when they were here , which means that there 's a memory thing attached to whatever it is that we 're looking for . I 'm still trying to understand how losing horrible memories is a bad thing . Because when an artifact makes it happen , I mean , who knows what the price will be ? Help you guys ? Yes . Hi . Uh , we were just wondering if any new objects have shown up here recently . New objects ? There 's half an inch of dust on every piece of crap in here . Sorry , " valuable n 'awlins memorabilia . " What 's this about ? You guys cops ? You look like cops . I 'm special agent Bering . Special agent Jinks . Dina Smith , special bartender . Is this about smugglin' or something ? No , it 's more of a data gathering thing . So are people pretty happy around here ? It 's the quarter . If drunk is happy , then they 're pretty happy . Ups and downs , you know ? How about these , uh ... These musicians ? They play here pretty regularly ? Some of ' em . I mean , musicians usually sign up for the nights they want , so ... Uh , this one musician ... Ethan ? Looks like he plays here every night . He 's the only one . Ethan Ellis , yeah . ♪ ♪ wow . ♪ ♪ he 's really good . He 's our prodigy . Is he okay ? He looks weak . Yeah , it 's some kind of nasty bug . It just won 't let go of him , poor kid . How long 's he had it ? Now that you mention it ... Must be almost three months . He 's been to a bunch of doctors , but they can 't find anything . Excuse me . That is not a bug . I was in less pain when I was dead . So several people who 've been here have recently lost their pain . And one guy also here is walking around with a mess of pain that nobody can figure out for the last ... Three months . Somebody has been giving Ethan Ellis other people 's pain . Declan , no ! Put that down ! I can 't get a " B " ! He wants me to change his grade . " A " students in biology participate on the I.M.T. bio team . And what , making your teacher 's brain go splat makes you team Captain ? - Aah ! - Fine . Don 't change it . I 'll get on the bio team some other way . They always run . Why do they always run ? And in one of the stranger things I 've said Declan , give me your marble . Hey . You got it ? Yeah . Two down , two to go . Not so hard really . Very piece of cake-ish . Aah . How you guys doing ? Uh , my guy 's here somewhere . I just gotta find him and reel him in like a fish . A angry , overly focused , possibly violent fish , Claud . I 'm talking , like Piranha 3-D , so be careful , okay ? Oh , there 's ... There 's Hugo calling , gotta go . Got it . So we 're thinking that Pierce , the boy with the third marble , might be in this seminar . Whoa , whoa , whoa , grab him ! Update , it 's Pierce . We have to stop him , uncle ... No , no , no . Brady , Brady , - as soon as Pete ... - No , no , no . There 's no time . We have to get that marble now . It seems that , uh , Brady has made the retrieval of that third marble his main goal . He 's very focused . I can 't ... I can 't let this happen anymore . Brady . Brady ? Brady ? How 's Brady doing ? It 's getting worse , I 'm afraid . I 'm trying to keep a lid on it . That school nurse is alarmingly gullible . I convinced her I 'm a doctor . I sent her to find an antibiotic that doesn 't exist . So , yay on that . All right , well , once Pete gets Pierce 's marble and I get this one , we 're done . Good , ' cause the downside is starting to kick in ... Erratic heartbeat , high blood pressure . I 'm afraid these boys are headed for cardiac arrest or stroke . Fret not . I 've got my marble in sight . Okay , well , you need to win this one . Gotta crush these north lake prep guys . I know . Hey , hey , look at me . You have one goal . Be the last one standing . I will . Okay . I will . Hi , do you have a marble ? I 'm gonna need you to close your eyes . Picture the astrolabe . Concentrate very hard . I want you to concentrate . Keep concentrating on the astrolabe , and keep that picture in your mind . Now that you 've got a very vivid picture , you can open your eyes . All right , now all we have to do is ... Oh , no . I should 've known . When you use one artifact to try to find another artifact , especially one as powerful as the astrolabe , it gets very complicated . I see . Well , it 's a good thing this wasn 't actually Jack Duncan 's spur . Yeah ... It wasn 't ? No . I bought it at a thrift shop in Univille . I wasn 't sure of your intentions . Now I am . When did you start to suspect ? The first time I was here . You used the astrolabe . You foolish , selfish ... You 've released an evil ... I did what I had to do . We 're done here . No more games . Someone who 's trying to hurt me ? - Come on , I ... - We heard you play . You 're really good . Do you think anyone might be jealous ? Jealous of me ? No , everybody here is good . Truth is , I 'm jealous of them . Well , has anyone given you any gifts lately ? Anything , um , unusual ? Or your trumpet , how long have you had it ? No , nobody 's given me anything . And I 've had my horn for years . We 're just trying to explain your illness . Good luck . In three months , the only thing the doctors think is that I 'm dying ' . No idea why . You know Billy Colfax ? Was a wicked good sax player . He had M.S. He said you just gotta play through the pain . It made him stronger . So that 's what I 'm gonna do . I 'm gonna play through the pain ... While I can . Excuse me . We got a good news , bad news thing . Marble . This one was a little too volatile to leave behind . Oh , great . We 're starting a collection . I have to win the debate . You ruined everything . His dad thinks he 's in the boys ' room dry heaving . We gotta hurry . Where is Pete with the last marble ? We have to goo this bag now . Couldn 't agree more . Brade , you okay ? It feels like my chest is about to explode . We 've got a wrinkle . Well , tell ' em . I don 't have the marble . It got confiscated . Confiscated ? By whom ? Marshall , the headmaster . I had a little anger thing in class . A little anger ... The master of understatement . And with this whole zero tolerance thing this week , he took all my stuff . He said I could get it back after class . So the headmaster has the last marble . Okay . And his big goals are what ? Probably kids getting a good education , right ? Or making more money at the bake sale . Car wash . I 'll bet he 's putting together a varsity car wash . So what 's our next move ? We need to find the headmaster and get that last marble . Okay , Hugo , you stay with the guys . Let 's get the school to shut down this I.M.T. thing before it gets ugly . Thanks for letting me look at this . Yeah , I can 't help but notice that ... Well , Ethan plays here every night . But three months ago , not ... not at all . Oh , God , he didn 't wanna get up in front of a crowd till he got good . I mean , he hung out here all the time , but just watching . And he started getting good ... Oh , gosh , about two , three months ago . Right about the same time that he started getting sick . Well , did anything change ? Did he get a new teacher , or ... Not that I know of . But , you know , one night , this old jazz man came in . And I remember because of the look on Ethan 's face as he listened to him . He was so enthralled . What was he saying ? He was saying that to really play , to play from your soul , you have to let your life 's pain out through your music . And to be a great jazz player , Ethan needed to experience more life . More ... more pain . Ethan 's music is the most important thing to him , isn 't it ? It 's the only thing he thinks about . Wow . Thanks . Okay , so if musicians ... Really good musicians ... Draw on life experience , pain , sorrow , fear ... Yeah . And all Ethan 's ever wanted to do is be a great musician ... Well , you think that he 's doing this to himself ? Maybe he has an artifact that allows him to play through the pain , to become a real jazz player . Even if it kills him . Well , Mr. Marshall went to the gym , of course . The last event of the I.M.T. is always basketball . The whole school turns out . Okay , thanks . But I wouldn 't bother him . He was loaded for bear . The school board 's going to be there , and he kept talking about how they were going to get theirs . I don 't think I 've ever heard him swear like that . Angry headmaster has it in for the school board ? - I didn 't say that . - Budget cuts . He mentioned something about the school board , uh , doing some budget cutting . More like budget killing . Mr. Marshall knows this board would take down the whole school just to save a buck . But I didn 't say that either . He 's going for the school board . And in a gym full of kids . All right , I 'll make my way to the gym . You go grab Hugo and meet me there . He knows his way around . He can help . Okay . I-I don 't see him . I don 't see Marshall anywhere . All right , well , I got Hugo . We 're on our way . Now , if the headmaster 's not in the gym ... No , no , don 't worry about that . I know every nook and cranny of this school . And I remember one time when I was 14 years old ... Uh , yeah . More on that later . We won 't let you shut down the I.M.T. Brady , what are you doing ? We heard agent Lattimer say that he 's gonna shut down the I.M.T. and he can 't . Tilson has to win ! You can 't just walk away from this . Maybe not . But I will not give you back the astrolabe . I don 't want it back . I want you to use it again . Undo everything I 've done ? No . Do you seriously believe you have a choice in any of this ? It should be your choice too . There is a great deal more at stake than you know . ♪ ♪ Ethan , you need to stop . Everybody 's a critic . We know what you 've been doing . You 've been stealing other people 's pain for yourself . That sounds like science fiction . Yeah . But you know it 's not . I also know I 'm not giving it up . No . Don 't worry about the I.M.T. Go make sure agent Lattimer isn 't shutting it down and I won 't worry . You know I can 't do that . I 'm sorry , uncle huey . Tommy , go ! There . That ought to hold ' em . Wha ... wait . Why did you do that ? What ? The world had lost hope . The astrolabe was our only solution . You ... you have to believe me . I tried to tell you . I was there ? Oh , yes . Well , surely I ... I told you you 'd ... You 'd be creating an evil ... An evil that I 'd have to live with the rest of my days . Yes , you did . But I can handle it . What about the rest of us ? Will you condemn the rest of the world to live with your evil ? It 's okay . This is what I want . Steve ! Hey , come on . But it 's killing you . It 's worth it . I can help you too . No ! I can take away your pain . No , you can 't . Oh , my God . What happened to you ? This is all my fault . - This isn 't your fault . - Yes , it is my fault . Brady knew about the marbles because I showed them to him . - I told him how they worked . - What ? Why ... why would you do something like that ? I didn 't mean for him to use them . But ... he 's smart . He 's special . Oh . Oh , my God . You ... you wanted him to become a warehouse agent like you . That 's ... that 's why you showed them to him ? Uh ... What is this ? This is my pain . Please stop . - Are you all right ? - Uh-huh , yeah . I 'm just having a little trouble breathing . This is another downside . What is wrong with me ? Why are you taking this out on yourself ? For 30 years , I didn 't exist . Then I got a second chance . But was that enough for me ? No . I had to leave a legacy ... Brady . - I was greedy . - No , reckless , maybe ... But not greedy . And I 'm ... I 'm gonna be fine , I think . What if I 've run out of second chances ? What if the universe is making you and Brady pay for my mistakes ? - Aah ! - Stop , stop . You 're choking , Claudia . You could kill her . What ? Aah , no ! Aah ! There . See ? It was probably just a little bit of stress . I 'm fine . Brady 's gonna be fine in a minute . And by the way , I don 't think the universe hurts teenage boys to punish their wacky uncles . I did this to him . Hugo ... If Brady is going to become the warehouse agent - you hope he will be ... - Yeah . Then save him . The only way we 're gonna help him is if we find the headmaster and that last marble . So we need you , Hugo . We 're running out of time . I will not undo what I have done . The brotherhood is more powerful than you think . I work for some pretty powerful people myself . You came into my house and stole from me , dismantled my life 's work , and I will respond in kind . Things have already been set in motion . And unlike your regents , we follow no rules . We do whatever has to be done . Yeah ? Guys , we got a code red . The entire school 's here . No one can find the headmaster . Okay , and my ... my vibes are off the charts and ... Oh , crap . It 's the school board . The headmaster 's targets . If this guy 's planning on getting revenge in here , there 's gonna be a whole lot of kids caught in the crossfire . This is a lot of kids . Yeah , and I don 't need vibes to know this is gonna get bad . Look , Hugo , if the headmaster had a weapon like a ... I don 't know , a rifle or something , is there any place he could hide to get a clean shot ? Everything 's exposed . Well , he 's here somewhere . No , there was only one place we could ... - Pete . - Yeah ? That door . Where does it lead ? - The furnace room . - Which is where ? Underneath the gym . All right , look , you guys stay here and keep looking for him in case he shows up . You 're in my way . Stay right there . Someone has to stop the board from tearing this school apart , program by program . What is that stuff ? Before I was an administrator , I was a chemistry teacher ... Another program they wanna cut . Furnace will turn this compound into a gas in 60 seconds . School board is sitting right under the vents in the gym . That will be that . They 're not the only ones in there . You 're gonna poison the whole damn student body . Collateral damage . Stop the board , that 's the goal . It 's good to have goals . Yaah ! Now that 's how you knock somebody out . Yeah , so if this stuff turns into gas ... No , Pete , you 've got to shut down the furnace before that happens . Okay . Um ... I got it . Eww . It 's all wires and circuits and stuff . Oh , hang tight . I 'll be right down . No , Claud , no . You won 't make it in time . Just get everybody out of there ... In case I can 't pull this off . Okay , Pete , come on . Come on , Pete . Think , think . Just focus , focus . What do I need to focus ? A marble . Come on . Hey there , little buddy . I 'm gonna need your help . So please work and don 't kill me . All right , heathers , very nice . Heather , Heather , Heather , Heather , and Heather , let 's not have a brain tumor for breakfast . Everybody out this way , please . Now whatever you do , don 't panic . Trampling each other will only make it worse if the poison gas gets out . Did you just say poison gas ? Yeah , it 's kind of a chemical reaction , you know ? Oh , my gosh , come on . Hugo , probably best not to use words like " poison " or " trampling . " Right . Okay , boys , carry on . All right , Mr. Davis , eighth grade shop class , you told me to start with the ground , so ... Whoa . Wow , that is so not uncool . We 're never gonna get all these kids out of here in time . Well , just ... just ... Just a sec , Claud . Pete , it 's kind of a now-or-never situation . Okay . Here we go . Up we go . Okay . Oh , Mr. Davis , Mr. Davis . Oh , thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Hey . You got it , right ? Pete , your arm . Pete ? - Pete ! - Hi . - Yeah . - Yep , let 's do this . What the hell was that ? Did I just ... Did I try to kill the ... No . Kill ? No . No , no , no . What did ... Well , maybe ... What did you have for lunch ? Nothing , just , uh , salad . Salad . - Yeah , it 's the mushrooms . - Yep , mushrooms . It 's all taken care of . It 's all ... the government 's taking care of that , so ... - Bad batch . - Mushrooms . Whoa , good . Thanks . All right , let 's go get that head taken care of , huh ? Claudia , thank you . No way , you were the one who figured out he was in the furnace room , so ... Not about that . Before , Brady . Oh . Yeah , sure . Hugo , when I was really young , my brother was reckless and I lost him for a long time . You just got Brady into your life . Why would you wanna be reckless with that ? Oh . Right . Hey . My great-great grandfather worked with Scott Joplin . Joplin left him this cigarette case , said it made him feel life more fully . That 's what he put in his music . So you thought the case was a shortcut to inspired music ? I was helping myself . But those people , I-I helped them too . People have the right to work through their pain on their own terms , heal themselves . You have to learn how to live your own life , Ethan . I 'm 27 . It 's a good time to go , you know ? My ... my music would live on . Morrison , Hendrix , Janis Joplin , Cobain , Winehouse , it 's ... It 's good company . It 's selfish . How dare you just decide to leave without thinking about the people in your life ? The people who ... Who love you . Like who ? Okay , you 're not just selfish . You 're also blind . You like ... you like me ? I mean , I like ... I like you . I just didn 't think ... Ugh . Musicians . Okay , there 's some life experience waiting ' for you right there . I figured it out last week . Whenever I get hurt , Claudia feels the pain . The metronome might keep my alive , but ... But if something terrible happens to you , it happens to Claudia too ? And there had to be a price for Claudia bringing me back , but I won 't let Claudia pay with her own life . Well , what does she think about all this ? You haven 't talked to her yet . If I tell her , she 'll just stop me from doing what I have to do . And you and I both know that taking myself off the metronome might be the only way to keep Claudia safe . What I know is that I 've lost too many people that I care about . Sam died . Dickenson died . H.G. is God knows where . I know . I know . I found your body in that hangar . I won 't go through that again . There 's another solution . There ... there has to be . I don 't see what . Well , you haven 't really looked yet . Maybe it 's time to start . Ethan started getting better once we neutralized the case . Though the sorrow and pain returned to everyone that he 'd affected . Well , now they can start to heal . Uh , speaking of that , Artie , I need to spend some time close to home . Skip a few missions and just focus on processing , learn more about the metronome , how it works . Take all the time you need . Thanks . Success , artifact retrieved , crisis averted , day saved . Good job . Bragging is unbecoming . Since when ? 'Sup , Jinksy ? Why are you wearing a serious face ? I keep telling you guys , this is just my face . - I 'm contemplative . - I don 't know . I 'd say it 's more " constipatetive . " That 's not a word .

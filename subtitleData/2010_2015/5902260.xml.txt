Yeah , Kunal Anand . And I 'm an idiot . I know you 're a little embarrassed . Not little . Very ! Why didn 't you tell me that you 're not a singer .. .. but a guest instead . Look , I knew you mistook me for a singer . But , I also knew that your musicians were late .. ... and you 're upset about your party tonight . So .. I kept mum for a while only to bring a smile on your face . Thank you . Come . Let me show you your room . Come . Was this the only pan of the body you could find ? Will I take the rest of it home ? I sent you whatever I could find . Just tell me which animal did this ? So that we can make our report , and send it to our superiors It 's difficult to say that . What do you mean ? I mean there is no leopard , panther . ... lion or cheetah behind this attack . Because they don 't have a jaw this big . The difference between the teethes on the side . ... is between 9-12 inches . But the distance here is much bigger . And , the force applied .. ... to sever this part from the body is much more . Come Rana . This doctor 's either a big fool , or he 's too smart . I suggest we shut down both the cases . Right ? And we 'll mention some lion or cheetah in the file . Sir , the doctor was saying . ... it 's not a lion or cheetah , it 's something else . Something else ? Do you have any name or whereabouts of this " thing " ? No , sir . So what do you expect to do ? Do you want to wander in the jungle .. ... and stick your head in his mouth ? Will you ? - No , sir . Then ? That 's why I am telling you . Lift your pen and jot down few lines . Close the case . Come on . I know he 'll come back . Humans can forget his past . But he 'll never forget it .. ... nor let anyone else forget it either . That thing lying inside is just the first body . There will be many more bodies . I had warned you .. .. against cutting down the Banyan tree ! But no one heard me . But no one can stop him . Only thing you 'll hear in the jungle now are screams . Screams of innocent people . Go away ! You will all repent it . He won 't listen to anyone . He will spare no one . Sir .. He 'll spread chaos . - Sir , what 's he saying ? Pay heed to my words . - It 's nothing . He 's uttering nonsense . Ignorant fool ! Sir , what if an innocent life is lost . ... because we didn 't take an action ? Come on , let 's do something else , baby . Something more fun . Something more fun is okay .. .. but , only if I can understand this map . So there you guys are . Everything that you need for a picnic . Thank you so much . Now that you 're here , please help us out . - What ? Can you please tell us which is the best route for trekking . ... because this map is very confusing . Okay , I 'll help you . There are two treks here . The longer route leads to a waterfall . And the shorter one leads to a campfire site . And I think this one is right for you guys . Campfire , baby , please . Whatever you say , baby . We 're here for our honeymoon . So we 'll go on a private picnic , right . You 're so cute .. Okay , guys . Get a forest . We shall . - Okay . Thank you . - Enjoy . Come , let 's go . - Bye . Follow me . Where to ? - Come on . Hurry up ! This way . - This way . Listen , this way . - Okay . This is so beautiful . Just like a postcard . Thank you , Baby , for getting me here . I am so glad .. ... that we didn 't go for one of those usual London-Paris types honeymoon . I am extra-happy . - Why ? Because there 's no place to shop here . Otherwise you would be shopping all day .. ... and I would 've followed you around carrying your shopping bags . What 's the point of coming this far .. ... when you 're still glued to this cellphone ? It 's an alarm . Alarm ? - It 's the last day for your antibiotic . You didn 't remember . So I 've done that for you . My nutcase husband . I love you . - I love you too , baby . Now , all the fruit juice that I drank , I need to .. - Yuck ! You always have to spoil the moment , don 't you ? Look , I can either spoil the moment or .. Shut up ! Just go . - Okay . Have your medicines , I 'll be back . I love you . Arjun . Arjun . Arjun . This is not funny . Arjun ! Oh my God ! Somebody help ! Somebody help ! Hello , dad . Did you do what you went there for ? No , dad . But I 'll get it done . Actually , it was evening by the time I got here . Who are you making excuses to , son ? Me or to yourself ? No , dad . It 's nothing like that . I know , it 's not a easy job .. .. but my experience says , either you do it now or never . Do you understand what I 'm trying to say ? Yes , I 'm understand . Take care . Can I come in ? - Yeah . Sure . I hope I 'm not disturbing you . Please sit . Is everything okay with your room ? Anything I can do to help ? - Yeah . Everything okay . Room is perfect . - Okay . Ahana , there 's something I want to say to you . I .. ... I am not like your other guests . I 've come here with a purpose . You tried to hide it , but I know . What ? I know you 're Kunal Anand , the famous writer . And you 're here to write your new novel . My receptionist told me . She 's a big fan of yours . So .. you were saying something . Yes . Ahana .. - Excuse me , ma 'am . Ma 'am , there 's a call from the hospital . Hospital ? - Yes , ma 'am . Ma 'am , the forest department officials . ... have admitted someone in the hospital . And they think it 's one of the guests from our hotel . Ma 'am , patient is seriously injured . My God . Tell them I am coming . Okay ma 'am . You see doctor , it 's difficult to catch this thing . - Yes . We cannot do anything about it . Do you get it ? - Yes . Excuse me , I am Ahana Dutt from Glendale Forest Lodge . Someone called about our hotel 's . - Rana ! Speak to her . Go , speak to him . Come . So I was saying . - Yes . I am from Glendale Forest . - Yes . Is this napkin from your hotel ? Yeah ! We found it on the victim . That 's why we called you . Can you identify the victim ? Yeah , sure . Come . Take down their statement . Oh , God . Is she a guest in your hotel ? - Yes . Shruti . What happened to her ? Well .. she was attacked by a wild animal . Could be a leopard . She was married recently . Newly wed . Her husband , is he okay ? Husband ? There was no one else with her . We found her alone . She was partly unconscious . What could 've happened , Kunal ? We 'll have to inform the victim 's family . You must have her phone number or address in your records ? I 'll call at the hotel and get it . - Thank you , . It was my fault that , I let my daughter come here . I had told them . Go to London , go to Paris . Wherever ! But no . They had to come here . You know why ? Because people like you give huge ads in the papers . Make huge promises . " Come to Heaven on Earth . " What you really mean is " Come to hell " . You ruined my daughter 's life to make a few bucks . You have killed my son-in-law . You and only you are responsible . Are you okay ? Shall I call a doctor ? What happened was terrible but , it wasn 't my fault , Kunal . If I had any clue .. " Then I would 've never let them go there . For everything that I have in this world . ... if the people find out , who 's going to live here ? And how will I repay the bank 's loan ? If this hotel shuts down , then I 'm finished . That won 't happen . God will never let you lose anything . God ! Sure ! When God didn 't help me out in Mumbai .. ... you think He 'll help me in Glendale . He 's already snatched whatever I had . He can do the same again . What do you mean ? Ahana . Talking is any day better than taking these anxiety pills . My Papa says , that . ... speaking your heart out doesn 't take away the pain . But the feeling definitely lessens . Come on . I lost my mother in childhood . My dad meant everything for me . 'He was my everything . ' 'My dad , my best friend , my confidante . ' 'We were very happy together . ' 'We had an old bungalow in South Mumbai .. ' ' .. and some builder wanted to raze it down and build a shopping mall . ' Think about it . 'But dad didn 't want to sell it at any cost . ' 'He used to say that . ' ' .. no one sells their family portrait for any price . ' He didn 't accept this deal . 'But they were businessmen . ' No ! 'Dad 's emotional talk had no meaning for them . ' 'Gradually requests turned into threats . ' 'And when threats didn 't work , they started scaring us . ' 'They would either disconnect our electricity or telephone line . ' 'But dad didn 't lose courage . ' 'He kept fighting . ' 'But they knew , that dad didn 't need money . ' 'So they created the need . ' 'They used political pressure . ' ' .. and got dad fired from his job . ' 'Not just that . ' 'They made sure that he didn 't get a job anywhere else . ' 'A man can stand humiliation from others . ' 'But when he loses respect in his own eye .. ' ' .. he 's completely shattered . ' 'I saw dad die a little each day . ' 'And then one day , that courageous man .. ... lost .. ' Ahana . I am just a psychiatrist for others . But I 've seen you grow up . I 'm like your mother . Look , in such situations . ... keeping to yourself only does more damage . You can share anything with me . After dad 's death . I was shattered from within . I can 't fight the world now . I 'll sell my property to those builders and go a new place . Where I won 't have to fight anyone ? And what if you face problems in that new place too ? You 'll shift to a different place again ? Running away from problems is not the solution , Ahana . You have to learn to fight . I know .. But . I don 't have the strength to fight . I 've decided . Fine . I don 't want to pressurize you now .. But yes .. you know it , if you want share anything . ... I am just a call away . These are Alprazolam pills . It 'll help you fight anxiety . Thank you . One more thing . The urge to commit suicide is genetic . Whatever you 're experiencing , thinking right now .. ... is taking you in that direction . Don 't ever go there . I know you are strong . Ahana , if we live in our past , it makes us depressed .. ... and thinking of the future makes us restless . So you should live in the present . Because the present is beautiful . There 's nothing wrong in it . That 's sweet . Finally we agree on one thing . The Forest Department is helping us . They will soon find a solution . But as long as that 's not done .. ... I would request all of you not to wander in the forest . If we can 't go in the forest . ... what 's the point of staying in this hotel ? It 's just a matter of few days . We 're really sorry for this inconvenience . I 'll wrap up this as soon as possible . Hey you .. You 're doing a great job . Don 't worry . Amit . - Yes , boss . We 'll be also making rice cakes and lentil for breakfast . Ready the coconut chutney . - Okay , boss . Hello . It 's me . Your beloved . Your love . How 's the kid ? If the kid 's ill , then take her to a doctor . Wife , don 't trust the newspapers of Bhopal . They write nonsense . Don 't worry about me . I never venture out of the hotel . My duty 's in the kitchen . Look after yourself , and the kids . Okay ? Amit , pick up the phone . Amit , please pick up the phone . Pick up the phone . Amit , pick up the phone . Oh my , God . How are you ? I am fine . Have you sent the sari to Sarita ? Don 't worry at all . Take it on credit . Don 't worry , we 'll cut a few trees and pay you back . You 'll get your money . Don 't worry at all . See you in the evening . Don 't forget to arrange for booze . I 'll talk to you later . Excuse me . - He worked in your hotel , didn 't he ? I heard he was your cook . Yes . That 's alright , madam , but first tell me .. ... what was he doing in the jungle late at night . He didn 't venture into the jungle . Don 't you understand . ... that animal 's ventured into my hotel . Your hotel .. Have you found rest of the body ? Can 't you see ? This is the body .. - Sir . What more .. - Sir , please . Ma 'am , we 're looking for it . We 'll find it . Soon . Is that panther behind this ? Listen to her . How would we know who was behind it ? You think the panther will leave his visiting card behind . Excuse me ma 'am . Mr. Rawat from the bank is here . Okay . Please come . - Thank you . Hello , Mr. Rawat . - Hello . How are you ? Good . Tea , coffee ? - No , thank you . Have a seat . Ahana , I 'm really upset about what happened . First the honeymoon couple , and then the cook . I mean , this isn 't good for your hotel 's reputation . And you know people come here to enjoy the forest . If they can 't venture into the forest , then " The Chairman thinks . - I understand your concern . Look , this is a setback for us as well . But please assure him there 's nothing to worry about . We 're trying our best to solve it soon . Right , right .. that 's exactly what we wanted to hear from you . Thank you . Thank you for your assurance . Okay , I 'll take your leave . Okay . Thank you , Mr. Rawat . - Bye . Ahana , I 've a way out of this . I 've some friends who can son this out for us . I 'll just have to make few phones calls . ... and some arrangements . Can you trust me ? Truth isn 't what you see .. ... on Discovery channel or the internet . If you see them up close .. " These wild animals can be very cunning . ... and very dangerous . Thank you . By the way , the forest officers are not at fault . They aren 't even well-equipped to defend themselves . If and when they are attacked . You get just one chance to shoot . And when you do , you need to be fully prepared for it . Ahana , I 'll be lying if I say .. ... I can feel exactly what you 're going through right now . But I promise you one thing . I will leave no stone unturned . Nagesh . Professor . - Yes . Here you go . When I was interviewing that girl .. ... my assistant recorded the conversation on his phone . Just for a backup . There 's a copy in here . Thank you . Most welcome . How do I explain what it was ? It wasn 't human .. or animal . It was 10 feet tall . It was huge . It had a long-broad tall , like a lizard . Long and sharp teeth . And strange eyes . He .. This is no lion or cheetah . It 's him . He killed my husband . It 's him . Ahana ma 'am . Come quickly . The hunters have got the panther . Oh my god , this is the same panther . My photo is here ... - Wait .. wait .. Shall we take our photograph . - Yes of course . Are you old enough to take a picture ? Thank you , God ! This is not fair . I do all the work .. ... and your God takes all the credit . Not done . How do you know what I 'm thanking God for ? " I 'm no longer .. what I was . " " I 've left myself .. somewhere behind . " " I 'm no longer .. what I was . " " I 've left myself .. somewhere behind . " " I 'm getting drawn towards you . " " I 'm turning into you . " " I 'm surrendering myself to love . " " I want to die , only to live again . " " I 'm surrendering myself to love . " " I want to die , only to live again . " Yes dad . You couldn 't do it yet , could you ? Dad , I .. I think you won 't be able to do it . Come back . I Will do it , dad . I 'm hanging up . Kunal you 've been nominated for author 's choice awards . Congratulations . I 'll see you . ... if you 're with me . " " I 'll forsake the world , I promise . " " No matter how many times we meet , it 's never enough . " " I spend each day with you , but my hean isn 't fulfilled . " " I started to smile after a lifetime . " " I am waiting for you . " " I 'm surrendering myself to love . " " I want to die , only to live again . " " I 'm surrendering myself to love . " " I want to die , only to live again . " " Your words sound like a prayer . " " That soothes my heart . " " One can see God in the eyes of the beloved . " " I 've finally realized that . " " I now bow before you . " " Now I wait in your path . " " I 'm surrendering myself to love . " " I want to die , only to live again . " " I 'm surrendering myself to love . " " I want to die , only to live again . " Most people invest in stocks at the wrong time . Run , Tushar ! Close it ! No ! Let 's go . What you just saw .. ... is what had attacked before and you thought , it was some .. ... wild animal or panther . Actually , it was a ' Brahma Rakshas ' ( Demon ) . 'Brahma Rakshas ' ? What the hell is that ? You will find its mention in the local folktale . Of course , there 's a detailed mention about it in our scriptures . You can even read it on the internet . It 's called the ' Brahma Rakshas ' because . ... it 's a curse levied on people .. ... who swore to dedicate their entire life to Brahma , i.e. God . But they couldn 't control their bad nature . And infested by their greed or selfishness .. .. they committed a unpardonable crime . Something like a rape .. ... or a murder . But what was this curse . The curse was that he won 't be allowed in Heaven or hell . He won 't be human or demon . His soul will never attain salvation or solace . His soul will stay imprisoned in his body . And his body will slowly morph .. ... into a dangerous creature , befitting his deeds . And it won 't have any element of humanity . Basically it will turn into an animal . Without any human left inside of him . But what 's fascinating is .. .. the more he eats the more his hunger grows . Of course , those who gave him this curse . ... didn 't know that his insatiable hunger .. ... will force him to target humans . You two may be wondering that , though I 'm a zoology professor .. ... I 'm speaking about such old and whimsical fantasies . But you 'll be surprised to know that . ... scientists are the most fascinated , by fantasies . Because a fantasy is nothing but a fact . ... that is waiting to be discovered . But if ' Brahma Rakshas ' exist . .. then why hasn 't anyone seen them ? Because those who saw a ' Brahma Rakshas ' .. .. aren 't alive anymore . And , no one believes those who are alive . Just like spotting a UFO . Or a ghost story . What mistake did we commit that he 's here ? What wrong have we done ? It 's not your fault . But yes , a mistake 's been made . What do you mean ? The highway construction workers made a mistake . There 's a solution to every problem . And similarly , there was a solution . ... to keep ' Brahma Rakshas' away from populated areas . A red thread was tied on the banyan tree outside the village . To curtain the powers of the ' Brahma Rakshas ' . Just like a ' Lakshman Rekha These construction workers .. ... uprooted many of those banyan trees . And made that demon more powerful . So , Professor , how do we get rid of this ? What can we do ? Nothing . Because there 's nothing that you can do . Just save yourself and run away . As soon as the conditions stabilize , we 'll inform you .. .. but , in the meantime be thankful that you 're alive . And please go away , as soon as possible . Just shut this hotel down . Please , just shut this hotel down . Ahana . Shall we go , Ahana ? I am not going . Hey ! What are you saying ? This time I won 't run . I came here fearing the creatures in the city . I can 't be scared by the creatures here and go back to the city . There 's no choice but to fight . I am here . Only one of us will survive . You .. Or me ! Hello . - Hello . This is the chairman , Mr. Raman . Hi. - Hi . Thank you for seeing us at such a short notice . But Mr. Raman wanted to see you as soon as possible . I understand , please sit . - Yes . It 's a bit strange , Ms. Ahana , but .. what to do . Our bank has invested a huge capital in your venture . I understand . I am really trying to fight this . Since you 've trusted me so far .. ... please have a little more faith . I wish we could do that . Rawat . What is this ? It 's a order . What ? Para 3 clause 12.1 ! It clearly states , that if at any stage .. .. the bank feels your hotel 's making a loss or liable to .. ... the bank will take over the management of the hotel . And that 's exactly what we 're trying to do . What do you mean ? You 're threatening to evict Ahana from her own hotel . Look , mister . It 's nothing personal , alright . It 's business . - No , this is not business . It 's blackmail . Look , I 'm only demanding what 's written in the agreement . And I am sure ... Ms. Ahana must have read the agreement before she signed it . Right ? I did , but I guess you people didn 't read it properly . But doesn 't this agreement also state . ... that you 'll give me a 10 day prior notice . ... before doing anything like this ? It does . So , Mr. Rawat , ask him to get off my property immediately . And don 't show me your face for the next 10 days . Fine , Ms. Ahana . We 'll come on the 11th day . But don 't forget . That day you won 't just evacuate this hotel .. ... in fact , we 'll sell every piece of this property . ... and recover our interest . So till then " all the best . Let 's go , Rawat . Yes . Bloody vultures . They are vultures . " But I 'm not a dead body yet . If my hotel was operational .. ... you wouldn 't have to go through this inconvenience . So you didn 't go back . I tried , Professor . .. but running away seems more difficult . On one side I can hear your words . .. that , this is beyond my limit . And on the other , I can hear the screams of the people . ... who came here trusting me . And I couldn 't save them . I 've realized that this is my fight . And if I leave it , then I might survive .. .. but , I 'll never be able to sleep again . Sorry . There 's an important meeting going on inside . Sir 's busy . He said he 's sent the report to Shimla . As soon as the Wildlife Trust of India receives orders from Shimla they will form a team and inform us . Can 't we just meet him , once ? I am sorry . Officer Rana , even we understand these excuses . But the question is .. .. whether you want to help is or not ? " My head 's on fire . " So this is your meeting ? And you don 't have time to listen to people 's complaints . Who are you ? You can 't just barge in a government office ? Who let you in ? Rana , how did they get inside ? We 're inside now . So now give us a docket number . Docket number ? What docket number ? For the report that you sent to Shimla . That report ? What report ? You all think I am crazy ? You think you 'll all tell me a story , and I will believe you . And then we 'll set out to play in the jungle . This is not a story , I 've studied this . What do you want to say ? I 've been doing squat in the jungle for 22 years . From the ants to the elephant . ... I 've an account of everything in this . These writers never write their book before interviewing us . And the animals which you teach kids about . ... we 've dealt with them . There 's no such thing as ' Brahma Rakshah ' . It 's just an old folktale of these villages . ... and you believe them . Closing your eyes won 't help , officer . There are others who have seen it . Not one , I can get you twenty witnesses . And they 'll tell the media .. ... how you failed to believed them and didn 't take any action . Do you get that ? You ... Although you 're working like you 're retired . But if your superiors find out . " Then you 'll even lose your pension . You .. - And through RTI if people find out . ... that you didn 't take any action then there will be action taken against you . Anger has never helped anyone . No , right ? Tell me .. what can I do ? Cooperation from your office and few weapons . Weapons . Now according to my research . ... the weapon that we use to kill ' Brahma Rakshas ' .. ... should be smeared with the ashes of Banyan tree leaves . Okay . So now this is the plan . Suppose this is the highway heading towards Shimla . Just like we use a mousetrap to catch a mouse .. ... similarly , we use a trap to catch this demon . And the trap will be .. an old bus . We 'll keep a human dummy inside the bus . And we 'll cover it with blood from the blood bank .. ... and fresh meat from the market . Just like a mouse is drawn by the smell of cheese . ... similarly , this demon will be drawn towards . .. the smell of blood and meat . But remember one thing . No one will fire as long as he isn 't completely in our clutches . Because 1 or 2 bullets won 't harm him . We 'll have to shower him with bullets . He 's coming . I can see him . No one moves . No one does anything until he 's completely inside the bus . Understood ? Understood . Understood . He 's heading towards the bus . Go closer to the bus . And when I tell you .. " Start firing at him . Okay . Come on . What the bloody hell is happening ? Come on . This way . Fire ! Run ! Go , come on . Run ! Ahana , that way . Fast , close it . Come on .. I had told you before . You won 't be able to endure this . You should have left . You said a lot of things , Professor . But what happened . The bullets didn 't have any effect on him . Ahana . The professor tried his best to help . He even risked his life for us . Sorry . No , no , you 're right . I was wrong . Because before this , I had only read .. .. about the ' Brahma Rakshas ' only in books . And people write what they experience . ... or what they 've heard . It 's always difficult finding real solutions in folklore . But there must be something . Some weakness. or secret . .. which hasn 't been revealed yet . There is one man who can help us . When this being attacked for the first time .. .. the headman of the village came to see us and my sir . I couldn 't understand everything he was saying . But according to everything he was saying . ... it clearly indicated that he .. ... knew about the Brahma Rakshas ' attacks . Where can we find this man ? It wasn 't just a banyan tree . It was the villager 's deity . A deity that protected them . We tried explaining them , but they didn 't listen . Bad luck never comes with a warning . They didn 't listen . They cut down the trees and built the road .. " But also paved a way for the Brahma Rakshah . But how can we stop it ? There must be some way to stop him . If we knew why would we leave our homes ? We 've only heard stories . What stories ? The same old things . Many years ago , a hunter killed the Brahma Rakshas . ... and saved the people . And then people performed a veneration . ... and planted that tree there . Do you know where that hunter hailed from ? Dear , I wasn 't even born back then . It happened 70-75 years ago . 70 years . Then possibly he 's dead by now . Oh yes , he does have a son , who often paid us a visit . He was practitioner of English medicines . He used to treat small kids . Dr. Moga . Yeah ! Yeah ! Okay , alright . So my students have shortlisted the names .. ... of two doctors who have done Masters in child health . ... and also visit this area regularly . One is Dr. Rakesh Moga , DCH New Delhi .. ... and the other is Dr. Om Moga , DCH Shimla . I think we should breakup into two teams . ... and visit these places personally . Yeah ! - Right . I was thinking , Rana and I will go to Delhi . Right . - Right . Kunal and I will go to Shimla . Correct . Two bottles of water , please . - Yes Ma 'am . We 're pleased to tell you that . ... Kunal Anand has been rewarded as best book of the year . Yes , before this Kanik Ray and Rohit Sharma .. ... were nominated for this award . Come with me . - Where ? Come on . - But where ? Watch . - What ? You 'll soon know . Kunal Anand is the first Indian to win this award . And he 's been given this award . for his book ' The Golden Sun ' . Mr. Kunal , heariest congratulations to you . Thank you . Thank you so much . You 're the first Indian to be nominated for this award . So how do you feel ? Obviously I am very happy . And I am also feeling very proud .. ... about the fact that I am an Indian . And I would really like to thank all those people who read my book . What was your inspiration for writing this book ? Whenever someone writes something or does any kind of work .. Who are you ? He thinks he 'll get handsomely rewarded for it . Karan . And maybe it 's the grace of God .. Karan Malhotra . The owner of Malhotra Builders . The one .. You spared your valuable time for us .. Responsible for your father 's death . What happened ? Who broke these ? I 'm sorry ... sorry ... Ahana .. Ahana , please . Ahana , listen to me . Just give me a chance to explain . Ahana I came here only to apologies to you . I am here so that I can face you again . I never wanted that all this happened . I just . I just pressurized him a bit . ... so that I could buy his land . I had returned studying architecture from London . I wanted to prove many things to my dad . But I made a big mistake in haste . If I had any idea that . ... your father would take such a drastic step " " then maybe .. I wouldn 't have been so stubborn . Please trust me . Trust ? After meeting you , I started trusting people again . I felt like there are good people in the world . You gave me hope and love . I felt like there 's someone in the world .. .. with whom I can spend the rest of my life . Someone I can trust . But I fell in love .. ... with a man like you . Ahana , please .. " Why do people use love for selfish means ? " " No one understands the pain in the heart . " " So let me live with this pain . " " I am better alone . " " Someday this hean will forsake your memories . " " So let me live with this pain . " " I am better alone . " " Someday this hean will forsake your memories . " " Enduring this pain is better than .. " " .. letting this separation torment me . " " Why do people use love for selfish means ? " " No one understands the pain in the heart . " " So let me live with this pain . " " I am better alone . " " Someday this hean will forsake your memories . " You 're on the right track Dr. Moga from Delhi spent his childhood in an orphanage . Give it your best try Ahana . This is our last chance . Okay . " Let the dreams shatter , that 's my fate . " " Let our paths separate , so what if the pain 's too great . " " Let me endure this pain , I beg you . " " Why do people use love for selfish means ? " " No one understands the pain in the heart . " " So let me live with this pain . " " I am better alone . " " Someday this hean will forsake your memories . " Are you sure ? Are you absolutely sure that you have seen . ... a Brahma Rakshas ? Yes . And not just me , others have seen it too . Oh my , God . It 's killing people . And I need to put a stop to this . Give me a minute . My father documented his entire journey .. ... to fight the Brahma Rakshas . This album contains photographs . .. taken by his friend and photographer , Krishnan Verman .. ... whom he took along . I 've heard that Brahma Rakshas . ... are a result of Lord Brahma 's curse . So only Lord Brahma can help you get rid of it . Do you see this temple ? This temple is in Pushkar . This is the only temple of Brahma in the entire world . Now listen carefully . Just like Ravan could be killed by striking at his naval . Dushashan could be defeated by striking on his thigh . And Brahmasur could be killed by making him . ... place his right hand on himself , similarly .. ... Brahma Rakshas can be killed .. ... by weapons dipped in the water of this Brahmakund . But the weapon can only be immersed . ... on the night of the auspicious Full moon . My father had 30 bullets of an old single-barrel rifle .. .. which he had dipped in that water . Even though he had a weapon .. ... it was difficult to control the Brahma Rakshas . Somehow my father managed to kill the Brahma Rakshas . .. but he lost his three friends . And used 23 bullets . I have still kept those 7 bullets safely . Now that gun and bullets will be useful to you . 7 bullets and one old gun . Do you think it will be enough to kill that Brahma Rakshas ? I mean , they had 30 bullets . ... yet only one survived . We 'll have to be determined to kill him . Otherwise even 7 or 30 bullets won 't be enough . If that 's the case , then why don 't we go to Pushkar ? New weapons , new bullets . The auspicious full moon is 11 months away . And I have just 4 days . I admit we have just 7 bullets , but we 'll have to take a chance . So how do we do this ? Do we wait for him ? No . We 'll go to him . I 'll head this way with my torch . Ahana , you .. ... head that way with your torch . Scared by the fire he 'll come out this way . You .. Stand there with your gun . As soon as he comes just shoot him . But remember one thing . ... you can fire only one bullet at a time with this gun . You have just one chance . Alright ? Okay , yeah . Come on , Ahana . Hurry up . Quickly . Come on . Come on . Go .. go .. Let 's go , quick . Karan . Karan . Why are you doing this ? Earlier , it was to alleviate the burden on my hean . Now I 'm doing it because my head 's made me helpless . " I am close to you again . " " I 'm fortunate to have this moment again . " " Looking at you has made me lively again . " " How do I explain my heart . " " .. that now I am your past ? " " This is the only moment we have . " " This is the only moment we have . " " This is the only moment we have . " " This is the only moment we have . " " I want to live it . " " My words are concealed . " " .. because you 're in front of me . " " The head 's looking for .. " " .. the love that once existed between us . " " I pray that you come back to me .. " " .. and say that you want to be with me . " " if possible don 't ever forget me . " " This is the only moment we have . " " This is the only moment we have . " " This is the only moment we have . " " This is the only moment we have . " Only three bullets left . Three bullets might be inadequate to kill him in his lair . But if he comes here .. .. then three bullets are enough to kill him . I know this place better than him . If I manage to draw him here .. - You ? Why not us ? Because you 're leaving , Karan . This fight is mine . I want to fight it alone . And what about the battle .. ... that I 've been fighting with myself ? You think I 'm doing you a favor . No , I need to kill that Brahma Rakshas . ... to slay the demon inside me . And if you snatch my motive from me .. ... that what will be the difference between you and me ? Okay . But on one condition . If we survive .. ... then you won 't show me your face again . You will go far away . Ahana , what . Ahana . Ahana come out . Let 's go . I dropped the bullet . I don 't know where . Come on let 's go . But when .. where ? Think . Run ! Where 's the bullet ? Last time I loaded the gun in the dining room . It could 've fallen in the kitchen or even somewhere outside . Outside ? It 's a damn big area to search . - We 'll have to find out . Come on let 's go . There 's just one way now . One of us will distract him . ... and the other will look for the bullet inside . I 'll do the first task " ... because he came her smelling my blood . No . I won 't leave you alone . If we stay together , we 'll both die . You will have to go . Please . But how will you distract him until I am back ? Ahana ! Karan ! Mr. Raman . Mr. Rawat . Such a pleasure . Ma 'am , you were truly wonderful . You 've managed to turn everything around .. ... in just ten days . Impressive . Mr. Rawat . - Yes . On behalf of our bank . Thank you .. but , this is for you . What 's this , ma 'am ? This is a cheque for Rs 76 , 80,115.45 ! We didn 't understand , ma 'am . Para 5 clause 14 . It clearly states that , if I return your money with interest . " Then , you won 't have any control over my property . But , ma 'am .. Axis Bank thinks I 'm a great investment . And other than your loan amount . " They 've sanctioned my 100 million loan . So now you guys get the hell out of my property . And stay out . Ma 'am . It 's the opening of your hotel . I thought if your musicians are late again .. .. then you might need this novice singer . You promised .. ... that you 'll never come back again . If I had kept my promise , my hean would 've shattered . So , to save my hean I broke my promise . Ahana , love me , hate me .. But please forgive me . And you know what . ...

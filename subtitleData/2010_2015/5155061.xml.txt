It won 't be long , Johnnycakes . My space-bus gets in at 4 : 30 . Just in time for the all-you-can-stand buffet at Chizzler . See you soon . [ Makes kissing sound ] [ Computer trilling ] [ All groaning ] Zoidberg , what is that ? That is the delightful creature I 've been video-dating for the past four years . Hit it with a stick ! Tonight is a dream come true ... A real live date in a physical place that exists ! I just have to go straighten up in case we end up at my place . There . My home 's all clean , except for one part . The inside . Aw , I 'm sure it 's fine by the standards of a gross alien monster . [ Yelling ] - Nope . - Step aside , people . I got bug bombs . Bender , wait . Won 't the bugs just run out and infest someplace else ? - Like our building ? - Not my problem . Fire in the hole ! [ Laughing ] [ Yelling ] [ Groaning and muttering ] [ Muttering gibberish ] [ Feet tapping , sighs ] [ Clapping ] Amazing ! You move like a young , roach-infested Gene Kelly . Oh , my God , it 's Randy ! Damn right , and I 'm organizing a tap-dance contest for the Parks and Rec Department . If you don 't enter , I 'll just kill myself , okay ? - Okay . - No , wait ! Me , little old Bender , in a dance contest ? It 's a way for the community to ... At last , a chance to realize my brand-new dream of being the greatest tap dancer ... In all the world ! Well , in a three-block radius . Of all time ! [ Humming ] Greetings , merchant . I need something beautiful and cheap for a lady who is one of those things . The cheapest thing I have is a bouquet of daisies for six dollars . Perfect ! I 'll take half a bouquet of daisies for three dollars . [ Cash register bell dings ] [ Grunting ] Ah , these flower shears are so dull . And I 'm already in debt to every knife sharpener in town . Allow me . Oh , thank you . That girlfriend of yours is one lucky lady . I 'm gonna snip her off her feet . [ Claws clicking ] Zindy ! You 're even more beautiful from a distance . Johnnycakes . [ Sniffing ] Good God , what 's that horrible stench ? Stench ? Uh , that 's probably this stinky bus station maybe . Come , let 's go someplace well-ventilated and grow old together . [ Sniffs ] Ah , much better . [ Sniffs , gags ] It 's even worse . It 's like comic-con in a submarine . [ Sniffing ] Oh , oh , my God . The smell 's coming from you . What , that ? That 's just my personal musk . You 'll learn to love it ; I know I did . [ Wind blowing ] I 'm sorry , Zoidberg , I can 't see you anymore . Something 's come up . It 's vomit . [ Gags ] I 'd like to return these for a refund . Don 't worry , [ Sobbing ] they 're unused . Oh , I 'm sorry . I get so little business , I can 't afford refunds . I don 't know what 's wrong with this location . [ Flies buzzing ] I understand . [ Sniffling ] Please don 't cry . I can 't stand to see a living thing feel pain . You are a living thing , right ? [ Crying ] Mm-hmm . Can I have a refund now ? [ Register dings ] [ Cackles ] [ Screams ] This here 's a bayonet . It 's some kind of kooky half-gun , half-knife . Now , empty out the register ! And no bag , please . I care about the environment . I have three dollars in moldy pennies . It 's all yours . That 's generous of you . Oh , no you don 't , Mr. Big Jerk . I have nothing to live for , so I don 't mind telling you those pennies are mine . Don 't you get it ? I 'm crazy ! [ Cackles ] Go ahead , I don 't care what happens anymore . Do it ; Bash my head in ! [ Wind blowing ] [ Gags ] What is that , mustard gas ? That ain 't legal . Ain 't you heard of no Geneva convention ? [ Screams , gagging ] [ Gasps ] That was amazing . Oh , you were so brave and frugal . I 'm sorry ! Don 't hit me ! Mmm . Ooh , I like the way you hit . But I don 't get it ... Most women I 've met can 't even stand next to me without collapsing . What 's wrong with those women ? Well , some of them didn 't have legs . But it 's not them ; It 's me . How do I put this delicately ? I 'm smellier than a whorehouse 's outhouse . That 's terribly vivid . Doesn 't matter to me , though . I was born with no sense of smell . Really ? My name 's Marianne . Hello , you . Mmm . Mmm . I like your dumpster . Thank you . The previous tenant was a very prominent raccoon . I remember . Too bad he got partially run over by that steamroller . Can I kiss you ? First , let me pinch myself to make sure I 'm not dreaming . Ouch ! I forgot I was a giant crab ! [ Music ] Welcome , fans ! I 'm Randy , coordinator of this tap-dance-a-palooza . Woo-hoo ! Randy ! After weeks of searching , I 'm proud to introduce the five people willing to participate ! Tonya , Bender , Greg , some kind of blob monster and Petunia . [ Clicking ] The extra clicking you 'll hear is gonna be my hip . FYI , this little lady has a heart condition . She 's always stealing them . Also , she has a serious heart condition . I 'm six years old , and tap dancing is my favoritest thing . Even if it 's not good for my pacemaker . All : Aw . [ Gunshot ] [ Crying ] [ Whistles ] That is one quality pacemaker . The rest of you might as well give up now , because I 'm gonna take home the ... Hey , what 's my grand prize gonna be ? Oh , there 's no prize , Dorothy . Unless you count the satisfaction of winning . It will be mine . In conclusion , bullying in the workplace is unacceptable and will not be tolerated . Bender : Out of my way , fatty ! I 'm practicing . [ Bender humming , others yelping in pain ] Ta-da ! Friends , I 'd like you to meet my new lady , Marianne . [ Muttering ] Whoa , hey . What 's the catch ? She looks normal . She 's not a hologram . Not a robo-slave . We give up . [ Chuckles ] You guys are weird . I have to go open my flower stand before the falafel guy takes my spot , but it was great to meet you . See you later , crab cakes . Dr. Zoidberg , she 's great . She 's the best thing that ever happened to me . We had a wonderful night of lovemaking in my dumpster . All : Ewe . I hope she used protection . Uh , no offense , Zoidberg but , how was she not driven to madness by your mind-altering stench ? Because , my friends , she has no sense of smell . Oh , I get it . That explains it . For the first time in my life , I 'm truly happy . It 's just too bad for her there 's no cure , I assume . Oh , but there is . A skilled surgeon could perform a nose transplant . Oh , you 're right . And I , as a renowned ear , nose and blowhole Doctor , could do the operation . Are you nuts ? If she could smell , she 'd smell you . Your relationship would be over faster than you could say ... [ gagging ] Listen to orange Joe . You must never let the girl know of this wonderful surgery . Oh , I don 't know . It doesn 't seem fair to Marianne . But on the other claw , maybe I can 't live without her . So you 're right . I can never tell her . You 're doing the right thing . Today , the competition begins . Over the course of the summer , we 'll be eliminating one contestant each week . And by " we , " I mean " me " . Deal with it , you babies ! Let the battle begin . [ Buzzer sounds ] [ Sniffs ] [ Buzzer sounds ] [ Sniffs ] [ Buzzer sounds ] Okay , before those pilates Nazis come goose-stepping in to take the room ... Here are the finalists for next week 's championship ! Bender and Tonya . I just want to have fun because dancing is fun and I like dancing . Crowd : Aw ... I 'm gonna kick your ass , little girl . [ Gasping ] For you , my lovely Rugelach . Thank you . It 's gardenia imperialis . You can brew it into a tea if you like severe stomach cramps . Such a smart one . You know everything about flowers . [ Sighs ] Everything but how they smell . Please describe it to me . [ Sniffs ] Uh , it 's like summer with a dab of vanilla and honey . Or maybe winter with some gravy on it . [ Sighs ] I 'd give anything to be able to smell a flower like that . Marianne , my love , I 've never known anyone who wanted to smell so badly . And there 's a way maybe you can . Really ? How ? We have in the Doctor world something called a nose transplant . I can give you a surgery , and when it 's done , you 'll be able to smell . Everything . Oh , Zoidberg , I want the biggest nose you can find . Dude , you made the finals . Congrats . You 've accomplished so much more than most of us would bother to . Yeah , but I 'm not done yet . I got a foolproof plan to make sure I go home the Champ . You 're gonna put sequins on your hat ? [ Scoffs ] See that locker ? Tonya keeps her tap shoes in there . So , right before she dances , I 'll sneak in and put rusty tacks in them . - [ Laughs ] - [ Gasps ] The harder she dances , the more she bleeds . Seems like a solid plan . What ? It 's the most horrifying thing I 've ever heard ! - That 's true . - Well , it gets worse . Once Tonya drops out due to blood loss , I kidnap her parents and make them watch while I cut off her hair with these hedge clippers . Don 't you lay a hand on that Angel . Angel ? I 've looked into her eyes and seen her soul . She 's a monster . You 're insane . Come on , Fry , let 's go . Okay . See you , Bender . [ Yells gibberish ] The championship 's mine , robot . [ Both yell ] [ Electrical crackling ] [ Crying ] Why ? Why ? What did I not do yet to deserve this ? [ Music ] [ Sighs ] Aw , I think it 's noble of you to give Marianne a new nose . Yeah , she 'll be forever grateful from somewhere upwind . True , our relationship will end when she smells my odor . But you know what would really stink ? If Marianne spent her whole life never knowing the beautiful scent of her own flowers . [ Panting , groaning ] Dr. Zoidberg , help ! Bender ? What happened to your leg tube ? I got beat up by a little girl . Please , fix my knee so I can get revenge at the tap dance championship . I don 't have time for this , robot . Here , patch yourself up with this medicinal wacky pack . [ Grumbling ] [ Siren blaring ] [ Gasps ] It 's time . I got a donor nose . There was an accident at the fencing academy . Touché . It 'll all be over soon , my love . May I have ... [ sniffles ] One last kiss ? Oh , there will be lots more . Yes , lots . [ Crying ] Nurse Amy , the anesthesia . Smell you later . She 's out . Then let 's begin this delicate procedure . Okay , dance maniacs , let 's have a big hand for our finalists ! Cute little Tonya and mean old what 's-his-name . Break a leg , Bender . Oops , looks like you already did . You are an evil , heartless troll . So , actually , we have a lot in common . In another life , we could 've been friends . No chance , garbage-can face . [ Grumbles ] Brace yourselves because we 're gonna try something you would never see in mainstream tap . A simultaneous head-to-head tap-off . [ Gasping , murmuring ] Oh , scandalous . It 's time for some fancy-schmancy dancy . Hit it , me . ♪ [ Slow , steady beeping ] [ Yells ] Ow ! Bender ! [ Cackling ] [ Gasps ] [ Laughing ] Ewe , look at him dance . He don 't care . Try this , peg leg . [ Grunting ] No sweat . [ Grunting ] [ Yelling ] [ Groans ] [ Sighs ] Time 's up , kittens . The judges conferred , and the vote is in . I pick her . [ Crowd applauds , Bender grunts ] Thanks , Mr. Nice Man . You know , the doctors say my heart doesn 't work very good . But it feels good today because I got to dance . And make people happy . [ Sniffles ] I never knew I could hate this much . Bender , she 's a sweet little girl . She 's a pig . I 'm gonna tap-dance on her grave someday . Oh ! This is the bestest-est day of my whole ... [ Gagging ] Oh , my God , people , she 's having a heart attack . A cute little heart attack . [ All gasping ] I 'm a Doctor , and yes , they 're real . [ Defibrillator whirring ] Clear . [ Electricity crackles ] [ Loud chewing ] [ Giggling ] How , how did it go ? Just perfect . This time , you can describe their beautiful aroma to me . [ Sniffs ] [ Groans ] What is that horrible stench ? I don 't know how to tell you this , but ... It 's these flowers ! [ Retches ] It 's not the flowers ; It 's ... [ Sniffs ] Ah , much better . You smell just like I dreamed you would . B-b-but most people think I smell like a burning zoo . I never learned a good smell from a bad smell . But I like the way you smell because I like you . Hmm ? [ Both moaning ] [ Nasally ] It 's so beautiful . [ Heart monitor droning ] I 'm sorry . She 's gone . [ Crying ] [ Whoops ] In your dead face , little girl . I 'm not even gonna wait to dance on your grave . I 'm gonna dance on your corpse right now . - [ Bender humming ] - Oh , my God ! - No , Bender , what are you doing ? No . - Leela : Bender , stop . The robot has to go . [ Steady beeping ] Huh ? What 's that ? I took a nappy . I don 't believe it ... she 's alive . Bender 's rhythmic chest compressions restarted her heart . He 's a big old hero . [ All cheer ] Oh , no , I was trying ... hey , wait , huh ? [ Grunting , stammering ] Just because you saved my life doesn 't mean I won 't beat you down again . Man , you are irredeemably evil . Together we shall rule the galaxy . Aw , what an adorable little kajigger . - Now ! - [ Both grunt ] [ Both laughing ] Ah , nothing like the first cup of dumpster juice in the morning . [ Crash ] Marianne ? Yes . Listen . I 've got a new job , and , well , I 'm going to have to dump you . I 'd like that . [ Beeping ] [ Groans ]

 Previously on Fringe . In the dreams that you were having , the ones that I 'm in , did you feel like you knew me ? You 're a stranger . What would I feel ? Clearly , I 'm in the wrong place , and all the people that I know and love are somewhere else . Now I just gotta figure out how to get back home . In the meantime , I can make it more comfortable while you 're here . It 's deja vu . I just wanted to check in with you . It can be kind of overwhelming . - I 'm not freaked out . - Good . So what were these trials all about , anyway ? Walter and William bell thought that children had extrasensory capabilities . And so they experimented on kids . Some of the children didn 't handle the Cortexiphan as well as you did . Some had adverse reactions ... Emotionally . You were always the strongest . Uh , I called in a prescription just a little while ago . - Olivia Dunham ? - Yes . This is your last refill so have your doctor call in a new prescription for next time . Yeah . I was hoping I wouldn 't need these anymore . Thanks . - Have a good night . - Yeah . Hey . This is bizarre . Well , I just , uh ... I was on my way home , and I only live a few blocks from here . I didn 't know that . So you 're just heading home now ? Well , from a walk . I had a migraine . And you know , fresh air helps . You ? Well , as far as 24-hour dining goes , this place is better than most . In fact , they make a pretty good cup of coffee if you wanna join me . You haven 't slept in how long ? Since I got here . That 's a long time . It 's hard ... Adjusting to a new city . Yeah , I can imagine . You remember a couple weeks ago you asked me if I was ... freaked out ? I used to believe just a few months ago that , uh , I understood the world we lived in . I mean , there were basic truths that I thought were ... Well ... True . I used to sleep like a baby . Blissful ignorance . You know , eventually it will just become your life . Is that what happened with you ? Yeah . Uh , sort of . - Hey . - Hi , babe . Are you close ? Yeah , sorry . I 'm almost there . I took the shortcut behind the theater . All right . You okay ? Ugh , no . I feel like I 'm being followed . What ? By who ? I don 't know ! I don 't know . I 'm sure it 's just my imagination . Where are you ? I 'm calling the police . No , Meg , it 's fine ! I 'm two blocks away from willow . Hello ? - Meg ? - Cops are on their way . No , it 's okay . It 's okay . I 'm here . I 'm ho ... This is grant . I need an ambulance at 1625 willow . 10-4 . Copy location . Dear God , what happened to this guy ? Is he alive ? What the hell was that ? What ? What are you shooting at ? I don 't know . Jack ! Freeze ! Ma 'am ! Ma 'am , stay back Jack ! He 's my husband ! Ma 'am stay back ! Jack ! Let me go ! Fringe SO4EO7 " Wallflower " By Mikhel for Subtitles. es = SPREAD THE WORD = you gotta love this assignment , right , Tim ? I mean , where else can you find baked goods , car parts , and video games all under the same roof ? Yes , sir . Sir ? I 'm moving up in the world . Did Broyles tell you to call me that ? Keep that level of formality . That way , you don 't get attached to your prisoner . You 're not my prisoner . So what , then you 're my bodyguard ? Maybe just imagine I 'm a friend . Yeah , ' cause every 32-year-old man needs a friend to chaperone him while he 's underwear shopping . You know what , that reminds me , uh ... agent Broyles told me to tell you that he has authorized you a $ 200 week allowance . $ 200 ? Big spender . The only other thing I need is safety glasses . You see ' em ? Nope . Here we go . Here , let me give you a hand . I 'll get it . Thanks . What was that about ? Nothing . Just figured I 'd help . You really think I 'd hurt a kid ? I 've been instructed to limit your interaction with civilians . It 's not personal . You know , I 've been investigating fringe events for three years ... I never thought I 'd become one . Like I said , it 's not personal . Victim 's name is Jack zoephel . At approximately 3 : 30 A.M. , his wife placed a call to 911 . He believed he was being followed home . His wife was on the phone with Jack when he was attacked . The police arrived less than two minutes after the call was placed . When they got here , he was already dead . I 'm assuming he didn 't look like this before he left for the night ? No . Walter 's gonna love this . What 's with all the broken glass ? That uniformed officer believed he was shooting the perpetrator . So he can identify the guy ? Not exactly . So you shot at nothing . I was just spooked , is all . You unloaded your entire clip . I don 't know what to tell you . I overreacted . I 'm willing to bet that you don 't want to risk telling us what happened because you 're concerned about your reputation . You don 't need to be . Whatever you saw , however bizarre it is , we need to know what it was . I don 't even know how I 'm gonna begin to file a report for this case . Well , we 'll take care of that if you just tell us what you saw . I didn 't see anything , exactly . But I ... I felt something . Like what ? A ghost ? You said ghost , not me . His neck is broken . Could have happened post-mortem . Cause of death could be due to rapid . Walter , I can 't understand you , wha ... are you eating ? Onion rings from Sully 's . Double-dipped in beer batter . Fantastic . He could have died from a rapid spike of adrenaline associated with fear . Could be why he 's white as a sheet . What are you saying ... that he was scared to death ? Walter , that 's just an old wives tale . Where 's your imagination ? You must have been a very boring child . I 'm ignoring that . Did Walter have any theories ? Uh , a few . But until he runs some tests , he 's not gonna know anything for sure . Can I ask you something ? All the things that we see ... Like this ... Does it ever get to you ? Yes . Every day . If I wasn 't seeing the agency shrink , my head would have exploded a long time ago . It 's not like I can talk to family or friends . I mean ... Well , who do you talk to ? No one . I 'm starting to think that that 's weird . That 's just not normal , is it ? We can rule out ghosts . What makes you say that ? Ghosts don 't bleed . Hi . How 's the morning treating you ? Pretty good , and yourself ? Not too bad . Glad the hot weather 's starting to turn . Me too . Fall 's my favorite . I love how the leaves change colors . After you . So , do you have big plans for the weekend ? There have been three bodies similar to this one found in the surrounding area over the past two weeks . And why is this the first we 're hearing of it ? Before they ran the medical records , the police just assumed that all the victims were suffering from albinism . It 's more common than people think . I guess . Any luck ? Well , so far , I 've checked law enforcement databases , including interpol , but it 's possible that this person 's DNA is not in any criminal database . What about hospitals ? That 's my next move . We call them albinos , but the kishwahili tribe from Tanzania called them " zeru . " Which is also the word for " ghosts . " Witch doctors from there sometimes used body parts from albinos in potions for good luck or fortune . - That 's ... - Grisly ? Yeah , I 'd say that . You found something ? Yeah . There 's a mucous-like substance on the body , a residue . From something in particular ? Uh-huh . They 're chromatophore cells you find them in octopi , chameleons . Cells that have the ability to translocate pigment in the body . It 's what certain creatures use to blend into their backgrounds . I just got a positive I.D. On the blood sample . Do we have a name ? Uh-huh . Baby boy Bryant . According to this , the blood sample we found at the crime scene belonged to a baby born on July 26 , 1989 , at parkview hospital in New York . And he died four days later ... July 30 , 1989 . Well , that 's quite a quandary . Perhaps we 're looking for a ghost after all . They started automating their records 20 years ago . Here it is . " Baby boy Bryant . Born 26 July , 1989 . " Gosh , they didn 't even give him a proper name . Infant born with an unclassified genetic variant . Over ten specialists examined him . No one could diagnose him . No medical precedent found . You okay ? Yeah , I just started to get another migraine . I can do it . I know you can , but you don 't need to . Thanks . I 'll get you some water . So this baby was a mystery . Says he died from complications of his genetic abnormality on the 30th of July , 1989 . Which we already knew . Thank you . Okay , Dr. Blake West and Teresa Jaffee , RN . See , I wonder if either of them are still working here . Ms. Jaffee , is this your signature on the death certificate ? Yes . Can you tell us what you remember about baby boy Bryant ? I was in the delivery room when he was born . He was so ... Pale . When Dr. West held him up , the lights in the O.R. burned his skin . We had to put him in a special ward with no windows and no lights . So when Dr. West told me that the baby had died , I was relieved that he wasn 't suffering anymore . What is it ? I 've never told anyone this . As they carried him out ... I thought I heard him cry . It was faint . But I thought I heard him . I assumed I had imagined it . Do you remember where he was taken to ? It was a private insurance company . Um , something like ... Cilas or ... Cyrpo , uh ... Cyprox ? Yes . That 's it . Cyrpox , incorporated . I was told they 'd be handling the autopsy . Thank you so much for your help . Okay . How 'd you know Cyprox ? Because they paid my mother 's medical bills while she was dying of cancer . And Cyprox was a subsidiary or a larger company called Kelvin Genetics . Why do I have a bad feeling about this ? Because Kelvin Genetics became massive dynamic . " Cyprox , Inc . " It 's been years since I heard that name . We have reason to believe that Cyprox , Inc . abducted an infant from a hospital 22 years ago . I 'm afraid your suspicions are true . What can you tell us about him ? The boy had an unidentified genetic abnormality . He would have died within a matter of days . But this same genetic deformity made him suitable for some ... Genetic experimentation . Walter discovered specific animal cells on the body that we found . Chromatophores . The nature of the boy 's cellular abnormality allowed those cells to be implanted into his system , making him able to blend into his surroundings . Making him a perfect spy or soldier . Well , there were military applications , yes . Unexpectedly , the experiment also allowed this child to survive . Something about the chromatophores offset his very fragile condition . And you knew about this ? No . This was a satellite research facility , one of dozens . Neither Dr. bell nor I had any specific knowledge of what was going on . Now , I 'm not trying to justify what was done . I 'm just saying that this child would have died had he not been part of that program . Maybe that would have been better . I think I 'll send the boy 's files over to Walter 's lab , maybe there 's something in them that can help . If you didn 't know about him , how are you so familiar with all this ? There was a fire in the lab ten years ago . And we assumed that all the subjects had died in that fire . That was the first time that William and I ever learned of Eugene . Eugene ? Well , that 's what the researchers called him . " U-gene . " Short for " unknown genetic disorder . " His entire life , he didn 't have a proper name . We assumed that he 'd died . And , as you can imagine , it was impossible to prove . So ... Now it seems as if we were wrong . ¶ Ziggy ? Ziggy ? Here , kitty , kitty . Ziggy ? Where are you ? - Hey . - Hey . Come in . Sorry it took Broyles so long to sign off on this stuff . I was starting to get worried . For all your help the other day , I 'm surprised he didn 't give you a badge . Thank you . That 's my job . No , no , I mean ... Thank you for treating me like a human being . I haven 't been getting that a lot lately . I appreciate it . So you really think it 'll get you back to where you came from ? The machine was powerful enough to snap me out of my timeline . Stands to reason that it 's powerful enough to snap me back in . I suppose that makes sense . I hope so . My best chance of getting back home . Alt universes , different timelines . Olivia says that , eventually , all of this is going to seem run of the mill . Which , frankly , I 'm having a hard time believing . It 's insane how none of this phases her . She 's made quite an impression on you , huh ? I 've never met anyone like her before . Yeah , I know what you mean . You were together , weren 't you ? You and Olivia . Uh , back where you came from . Yeah , we are . Uh , I 'm ... I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to ... no , no , no . It 's okay . The Olivia you 're talking about ... That 's not my Olivia . This is agent Lee . I 'll be right there . I need to go . Walter has something to show us . No problem . See you later . Oh , good , you 're here . I want to show you something . Is that an octopus ? Charming , isn 't she ? Brilliant , creative creatures . You know , they actually do build gardens . And colored rocks and plants and shells , and even garbage . They arrange them around their caves . And they 're like chameleons . Hey , Walter , why did we just get a bill for $ 818 ... You know I 'm gonna be the one to take the blame for this . Tell agent Broyles that ... Science has no price tag ! I 'm sure he 'll be very pleased to hear that . Uh , Nina sent over some files for you . Thank you . Eugene . Fascinating story . Walter , do you think that Eugene is trying to make himself visible ? That he 's killing people in order to steal their pigment ? Is that even possible ? It 's possible , of course . Leprechauns are possible . That would explain the mucous on the victim 's body . I didn 't understand what it was , but it must be acting as some kind of conductor . And that 's how Eugene 's chromatophores are absorbing the victim 's pigment . To overcome what 's been done to him would require a considerable amount of pigment . Walter , you 're saying that if I 'm right ... yes . I 'm afraid you 'll be finding a lot more victims . Everyone , come quickly ! I have two pieces of news . First , he 's dying . Who 's dying , Walter ? Our suspect . The chameleon man . I 've spent the last few hours recreating what we believe our young man is doing to himself , and , assuming you 're right , Olivia , and he 's trying to re-pigmentize himself , then ... Is that a word , " re-pigmentize " ? Well , go on , Walter . What is he trying to do to himself ? Well , the condition he was born with was killing him . If he is now attempting to reverse what was done to him , to make himself normal ... Or what was normal to him ... Then he is , in fact , committing suicide . So you 're saying he 's poisoning himself ? In a sense , yes . His body 's reverting to the deadly condition that he came into the world with . Although ... He may not be aware of it . Well , how long until he dies ? Oh , don 't worry . John here will be fine . Uh , I don 't think Olivia meant the mouse . The human ? Well , I can 't say . I suppose it depends on how successful he is . Okay , well , that doesn 't change anything . We still have to find him . Well , how do we find something we can 't see ? That was the second thing I had to tell you . Ultraviolet light . Come on , yoko , where are you ? She 's been there the whole time ? That was Broyles . They found another body . I was just starting my shift when I saw the body . I didn 't know what it was at first , all pale and white . It took me a while to see it was Mr. ryerson . Are the surveillance cameras functional ? Yeah , just installed a few weeks ago . There 's been some break-ins recently . And you say that nobody left the building ? There 's an emergency alarm on the back door , and you were at the front door the whole time ? You never walked away , not even to go to the bathroom ? No , and I watched the security footage again , just to make certain . This is going to sound odd . Even though you didn 't see anyone , did any of the exterior doors open on their own ? What are you looking for ? Lieutenant Broyles , the dog has got the scent ! Where does that door lead ? To the upper levels ! Are there any building exits on the floors ? No ! Sir , he could still be up there . Lock this place down . I need every available unit to the Elmwood apartments . Lieutenant Broyles ... Last floor 's evacuating . Have they been instructed to leave their doors open ? Mm-hmm . Okay , shut it down . Everything but the elevators . Shut down as planned . Over . Code four . My men are ready . Okay . You take your team down and clear the parking garage and the basement . I 'm gonna take one dog team up to the highest floor , work our way down . You start here . We 'll meet in the middle . Okay . You guys come with me . We 'll take the north stairwell . This is taking too long . Let 's split up . Go . I 'll take this floor . Let 's make sure he copies it . We 've got a scent . Right there , right there . Yeah . Just a couple more . Uhh ! Olivia , do you read ? Uhh ! False lead . It 's just a shirt . Olivia , can you read me ? Olivia ? Come in ! Help me , please . You understand right now how important it is to be seen . Your life depends on it . Me seeing you right now . Okay , just wait . Listen , you 're dying . Whatever it is that you 're doing to yourself , it 's killing you . Just ... please let us ... let us try and heal you . I don 't think you 're here to help me heal . Not after what I 've done . If you 're here to help me , it 's because I have value to the military , and they don 't want the long-lost experiment 69545 to self-destruct ! Not when they found him again . We have nothing to do with the military . I am just here to stop the killing . All my life ... I 've been watching them live theirs . Watching them ... Fall in love . To be looked upon by the right person ... To connect ... And to see in their eyes kindness . Happiness . And ... Recognition . That 's when you exist . Liv ! Please respond ! Are you okay ? There is a scientist who I work with for the f . B.I. He works out of a Harvard lab . Now , if anyone can hope to undo what they 've done to you ... I lived my life in a lab ! I am not going back ! If you treat yourself again , even once , it could kill you . Olivia ! Where are you ? Olivia ! She 's in here ! He 's got my gun . Spencer , come in . Agent Broyles . We 've got nothing . And the dogs have been through every floor twice . He 's gone . Let 's get these people into their homes . Let ' em in ! Sir . Go ahead . You 're gonna want to see this . There 's a sub-basement where all the pipes run . It 's designed as a service bay . This is his home . These items must belong to all the residents . Like he kept a small token from each person 's life . He was watching them . Looks like you were right . He was trying to cure himself . Well , this isn 't about curing himself . This is about being seen . I thought you weren 't coming today . I see you every day . I - I thought you might have caught the cold that 's been going around . No . Well , that 's good , then . It 's too beautiful a day to be sick . The most beautiful . My name is Eugene . I 'm Julie . I thought you should know that we found Eugene Bryant 's body . So it 's over . Well , thank you . When you could have called to tell me . All he wanted was to be like ... Everyone else . But how could he ? He 'd never be like anyone else . Not after what they did to him . So you 're thinking about what was done to you . You know , even with my colleagues , I 'm different . Things that should bother me ... Do you think that it 's possible the Cortexiphan trials stunted my emotions ? Oh , olive , you can 't let what happened to you as a child define you . And no ... the answer to your question is you are perfectly normal . At least as normal as any of us is normal . Life is an experiment . You have to find out where you belong , find your own place in this world . But shouldn 't I know where that is by now ? Not necessarily . I mean , before you and your sister came to live with me , my life was work . And I didn 't think that I could find the time or the room for you girls in my life . Now , I can 't imagine what my life would have been like if I hadn 't taken that risk . Now , when the time is right , you 'll know . Hey . What 's this ? I got you something . Just trust me . I 'm gonna get going . Broyles is letting me use the lab . Hey . Is that our paperwork ? Yep ... Just finished . Thank you . Guess we can put this case on the list of things that makes it hard for you to sleep . That list is getting longer . Well , maybe if you find yourself , uh , at the diner tonight , say , around 3 : 00 A.M. , I might , uh , I might see you there . I 'll see you then . Maybe . Clear . Should we move her to the bed ? No need . She 's not gonna remember the last two hours , anyway . When she wakes up , she 's gonna have one hell of a headache .

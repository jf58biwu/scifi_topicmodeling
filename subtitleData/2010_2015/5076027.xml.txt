 ARTIE : Previously on Warehouse 13 ... BROTHER ADRIAN : Using the astrolabe unleashes a formidable evil that has to be eradicated . Now , will you help me , Arthur ? Of course . The metronome is for Steve . I 'm bringing him back . ( GASPS ) ADWIN : Agent Jinks is linked to the metronome . We do not yet know the downside of this artifact . Oh ! Ow . Ah , it got me . I don 't see anything . God , I can feel it . MYKA : I remember the time . CLAUDIA : I mean , it 's like I know Artie 's mad . PETE : Where is he ? CLAUDIA : I don 't know . STEVE : Awful . CLAUDIA : No , he 's not . He just ... Finally ! You told us to meet you here 30 minutes ago , you 're never late . Are you okay ? I told them you probably got hung up yelling at kids to get off your lawn . Yeah , or maybe you were busy inventing fire ! You know , from caveman times . I 'm not allowed to do those , am I ? No . I got a message from Hugo Miller . Oh , how is he ? CLAUDIA : Aw , Huey ! Oh , he ... He 's still irritating . And he 's scattered . But I managed to piece together that he 's found an artifact . We 're gonna have to go retrieve it . So , Pete , I 'm gonna be sending you . And Claudia . What ? But I partner with Steve . I mean , I did just bring him back from the dead , so I kind of own him now . No offense , Pete . Nah ! " No offense , Pete " ? You are going with Pete . This is a job . This is not a " Choose Your Own Adventure " book . Oh ! Munchkin ! Come here , you little ... Come here . ARTIE : Alright , Steve , you and Myka , you 're gonna go to New Orleans . You 're gonna talk to a Dr. Nina Golden , she 's a therapist . Apparently , a bunch of her patients have been cured overnight . Well , maybe she 's just a good therapist ? No , no . These people have severe issues . PTSD , grief , paralyzing phobias , and literally overnight , their issues have disappeared . It 's been going on for three months . So we are gonna stop an artifact that helps troubled people become well ? Yes ! You are . What do we know about artifacts , any artifacts , even the ones that apparently are just doing good ? Yes , we 've got it . We 're on it . Good . Great . Everybody go away . Pete ? Ah , ah , ah ! Manhandling , Artie . Manhandling ! I want you to keep an eye on Claudia . What ? Why ? What 's wrong ? Is she okay ? No , no , she 's fine . She 's just been through a lot . And I just wanna make sure that she 's not under too much stress . Alright , okay , Sure , of course . Good . Bye . Yeah , okay . ( DOOR CLOSES ) Hey ! It is such a treat to have visitors ! ( LAUGHS ) You know , I 've been a nomad for the last couple of years , and I finally decided to quit fighting it and come back to my old pad . My home , sweet home ! Yeah , I love what you 've done with all the beige ! ( LAUGHS ) Yeah ! Sit , sit . So , Hugo , do you , uh , you have something for us ? I thought you 'd never ask . Take a look at these little beauties . This , my friends , is a bag of marbles once owned by a young Bobby Fischer , huh ? Just one of these little cuties gives the holder intense focus and a powerful drive to achieve any goal he sets . ( SNICKERS ) Cool . ( CHUCKLES ) However , prolonged exposure can lead to violence . Ah . Less cool . Uh , and ultimately insanity andlor stroke . I searched for them back in the ' 70s , but I was never able to find ' em . And then I was , uh , waylaid by the Warehouse computer system . So how 'd you get them ? FedEx . Well , that 's weird . Whoever sent these must have known these little beauties were way up on my most-wanted list . Uncle Huey ? Hey ! There he is . Agents Donovan and Lattimer , this is my one and only nephew , Brady . Very nice to meet you both . Brady 's staying with me while he attends the Tilson Academy , my Alma Mater . Brady here got hold of the bag of marbles , which I left on my desk and the research papers . And he took them with him to school , the little devil . I just got curious . Curious ? Do you hear that ? I mean , bad , Brady . Bad . Tilson 's competitive . Especially this week , there 's even more pressure because of the I.M.T. Oh , right ? The I.M.T. , the International Monkey ... Interschool Multidiscipline Tournament . Like " Hogwarts ! " Oh , cool . There . " Hogwarts " . Less cool . See , unfortunately it 's all tied up with , uh , alumni support , so the parents and the faculty tend to push the kids a bit hard . It 's down to us and North Lake Prep , our cross-town rivals . We hate them . So , Brady , you wanted the marble to focus you ? To give you an extra boost ? Yeah , yeah . I mean , I used one to write my paper for the I.M.T. Computer-engineering event . Wrote it in , like , 20 minutes . It was awesome . ( LAUGHS ) But he , he brought them right back , before anything bad happened . Yeah . Well , yeah . Well , actually Uncle Hugo , there is kind of a problem . I mean , uh , well , I thought it would . I thought it would go away , but it 's just getting worse . ALEX : I finished my latest tour in Afghanistan six weeks ago I 'm a helicopter pilot . And you started seeing Dr. Golden as soon as you got back ? Alex suffered from PTSD . He was shell-shocked and withdrawn . And we hadn 't even gotten to the core issues , and then yesterday . His symptoms were simply gone . Is it possible that you ... Well , you 're just having a good day ? Except I don 't even remember being PTSD . No , I 've seen similar responses in several patients over the last three months . And I 'm worried . Proper healing takes time . Is there any connection between the patients ? Any of them related ? Live in the same neighborhood ? No . They 're not even suffering from the same traumas . A young Katrina widow , a child recovering from an accident and Alex 's war experience . They 're all completely over it . Well , it 's a good thing we 're here to stop that from happening . Steve . And you 're from the government ? I mean , it 's fine , it just seems odd that the federal government ... Uh . Health and Human Services . We 're here collecting data . We love numbers . Uh , have you , uh , gotten any , any unusual objects in the office recently ? Hmm , objects ? No , I don 't think so . Why ? We 'll need to see your files . And your patient reports . You can black out the names for confidentiality . But we 're here to help you find a link . Of course . ( THUNDER RUMBLES ) Arthur . Hello . Brother Adrian . I don 't ... I , uh ... This isn 't a good time . And I have not found anything yet to help you locate the astrolabe , I promise you ! Exactly , why I 'm here . I believe I have found something to help us discover just who stole it . Great . Brady , you should 've told me about this . Well , it just started happening . Alright , well we 're gonna fix this right now . Just stand back . Prepare to be wowed . Wow ? It 's usually much " wow-ier " than that . No reaction . Kid , let me see your arm . Yeah . No change . What have we missed ? I mean , I might 've ... Loaned a marble to a kid named Tommy ? Bunch of cell phone videos on your Friend-Feed . A rather scrawny Tommy , is currently in the process of beating the crap out of a much larger " Slytherin . " Brady . You loaned out one of the marbles ? Actually , I might 've loaned out four of them . ( SCHOOL BELL RINGS ) HUGO : I know that boy . He 's a good kid ! It seemed only fair to lend out the marbles . I didn 't want to be selfish . Yeah . Which would be admirable if you were sharing a bag of chips or passing around a joint at a concert . Which , would be really bad . That would be terrible . What Uncle Huey means is that artifacts are always dangerous . Why don 't you wait in there while I do my work out here ? Good idea . Hey . Alright , Tommy , show ' em . Go ahead . Show him what you showed me . Brady said the marble would just help me focus on my goals . You 're not gonna call my parents , are you ? No , just next time , try a Red Bull . Well , I don 't get it . Was beating up that kid one of your goals ? No . But I had to get onto the I.M.T. Calculus team , and there was only one spot left . So that Gigantor is a calculus expert ? Alright , look . We , uh , we 're gonna need that marble back now . Fine . Agent Lattimer . Thank you for waiting . I 'm still not sure why the Secret Service cares about ... School violence . Yeah . The President 's made it one of his top priorities this year . I 'm in trouble , aren 't I ? ( WHISPERS ) Tommy . Pulling this during I.M.T. Week ? Thanks to the absurd budget cuts our esteemed school board is making , we 're all under pressure to generate more alumni support . The atmosphere is already fraught with tension , the board must see the I.M.T. As a success . I have to enforce a zero-tolerance policy . I 'm sorry . Great . Hear that ? The atmosphere is fraught with tension . Throw in some violent , deadly marbles , and Harry Potter becomes Full Metal Jacket . There 's nothing here , except a lot of seriously depressing stories . Hey , uh , Steve , you know , I know what it 's like . Coming back after being away . So , if you ever wanna talk . Kinda different circumstances though , wouldn 't you say ? Yes , it is . But still , talking is talking . I 'm good . Really . I am fine . Really ? It 's ironic , you know , the guy who can see lies is actually a terrible liar . You know , Pete warned me about this . He said if you started talking about feelings , that I should just change the subject . Really ? Like Pete has feelings . You don 't wanna talk about it . That 's , that 's fine . You 're right . There 's nothing in here . Steve ? Steve , come look at this . It 's a Jazz Club right down the street . STEVE : " The Altered Scale . " MYKA : Does the logo look familiar ? So Alex had it on his t-shirt , so we know that he 's been there . Given how close the bar is , and , and how any patient who 's been here would 've seen it . Maybe we should talk to them and find out if any other patients like jazz and free drinks . I know I do . I know I do . Here 's a list of the other three guys . What if they turn violent like Tommy did ? Hey , don 't worry about it . You 're gonna be celebrating in no time . Hey , Brade-ster , you probably know their schedules , right ? So , let 's figure out what classes your pals are in right now . You okay ? Yeah , yeah . I just , I 'm ... I was careless with an artifact , again , and now my nephew is in trouble . Hey , it 's all right , accidents happen . Don 't beat yourself up about it . We can just get Tommy to do that . ( BOTH CHUCKLE ) Okay guys , let 's split up and get us some marbles ! Come on . We 'll fix this . Right . So , what do you like ? You like ... BROTHER ADRIAN : It used to belong to some old sheriff , I think ... Jack Duncan , the most successful bounty hunter in New Mexico . Not " some old sheriff . " Details , specifics , they matter . That 's how we understand what these artifacts actually do . Of course , of course , it 's fascinating . Well , from what I 've learned , this spur can help us track the movements of the missing astrolabe . ( CHUCKLES ) Oh ! The way , the way a bounty hunter tracks a person . That 's , that 's quite good . Yes . Isn 't it . Unfortunately , the Regents they , they 're our board of directors , and they 're rather strict . And Warehouse agents aren 't allowed to actually use these artifacts . Understandable . However , given the danger of the astrolabe , isn 't it in all of our interests , your organization and mine , to retrieve it by any means necessary ? It would take a tremendous amount of digging into how the spur actually works , to know what the potential downsides are . See , we don 't just rush into these things without a huge amount of ... Research ? Mm-hmm . These are my findings . You have findings . Yes , I do . Histories of the spur 's use , plus anecdotal evidence showing minimal downside . Horses will be afraid of you for a couple of days . Do you ride horses ? What a relief . So now you 're free to show me how all of this works . This is exciting , isn 't it ? Yes , let 's , let 's use that word . ( JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING ) Oh , my God . Will you look at this place ? Can you goo a whole building ? Huh ! It could be any of these things . Well , whatever it is , we need to be careful . None of the patients can remember exactly what happened to them when they were here . Which means that there 's a memory thing attached to whatever it is that we 're looking for . I 'm still trying to understand how losing horrible memories is a bad thing . Because when an artifact makes it happen , I mean , who knows what the price will be ? Help you guys ? Yes . Hi . Uh . We were just wondering if any new objects have shown up here recently . New objects ? There 's half an inch of dust on every piece of crap in here . Sorry , valuable " N 'aw 'lins " memorabilia . What 's this about ? You guys cops ? You look like cops . I 'm , uh , Special Agent Bering . Special Agent Jinks . Dina Smith . Special Bartender . Is this about smuggling or something ? No , it 's more of a data gathering thing . So , are people pretty happy around here ? It 's the Quarter . If drunk is happy , then they 're pretty happy . Ups and downs , you know ? How about these , uh , these musicians ? They play here pretty regularly ? DINA : Some of them . I mean , musicians who do sign up for the nights they want . So ... Uh , this one musician , Ethan ? Looks like he plays here every night . He 's the only one . Ethan Ellis . Yeah . Wow . He 's really good . He 's our prodigy . Is he okay ? He ... He looks weak . Yeah . Some kind of nasty bug . Just won 't let go of him . Poor kid . MYKA : How long 's he had it ? Now that you mention it , must be almost three months . He 's been to a bunch of doctors , but they can 't find anything . ( PHONE RINGS ) Excuse me . That is not a bug . I was in less pain when I was dead . So , several people who 've been here have recently lost their pain . And one guy , also here , is walking around with a mess of pain that nobody can figure out for the last three months . The last three months . Somebody has been giving Ethan Ellis other people 's pain . BIOLOGY TEACHER : Declan , no , put that down ! I can 't get a B ! ( BOTH GRUNTING ) He wants me to change his grade ! Only A-students in Biology participate on the I.M.T. Bio Team ! And what , making your teacher 's brain go splat makes you Team Captain ? ( GRUNTS ) Fine . Don 't change it . I 'll get on the Bio Team some other way ! They always run . Why do they always run ? ( GROANS ) ( GRUNTS ) And , in one of the stranger things I 've said on this job , Declan , give me your marble . ( FARNSWORTH RINGING ) Hey . You got it ? Two down , two to go . Not so hard , really . Very piece-of-cake-ish . ( GRUNTS ) How 're you guys doing ? Uh , my guy 's here somewhere . Just gotta find him and reel him in like a fish . Uh , an angry , overly-focused , possibly-violent fish , Claud . I 'm talking , like , Piranha 3D , so be careful , okay ? ( FARNSWORTH RINGING ) Oh ! There 's , there 's Hugo calling . Gotta go . Got it . So , we 're thinking that Pierce , the boy with the third marble , might be in this seminar . ( GRUNTS ) ( ALL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ) Update . It 's Pierce . We have to stop him . No , no , no . Brady , Brady . As soon as Pete ... No , no , no ! No , there 's no time . We have to get that marble now ! It seems that , uh , Brady has made the retrieval of that third marble his main goal . He 's very focused . I can 't , I can 't let this happen anymore ! Brady ! Brady ? Brady ! ( ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY ) How 's Brady doing ? HUGO : He 's getting worse , I 'm afraid . I 'm trying to keep a lid on it . That school nurse is alarmingly gullible . I convinced her I 'm a doctor . I sent her to find an antibiotic that doesn 't exist , so yay on that . Alright , well once Pete gets Pierce 's marble and I get this one , we 're done . Good , ' cause the downside is starting to kick in erratic heartbeat , high blood pressure . I 'm afraid these boys are headed for cardiac arrest or stroke . REGGIE 'S FATHER : You ready for this ? REGGIE : Of course . Fret not . I 've got my marble in sight . Okay , well you need to win this one . Crush these North Lake Prep guys . I know . Hey , hey . Look at me . You have one goal , be the last one standing . I will . Okay . I will . Hi . Do you have a marble ? I need you to close your eyes , picture the astrolabe . Concentrate very hard . I want you to concentrate . Keep concentrating on the astrolabe . And keep that picture in your mind . Now that you 've got a very vivid picture , you can open your eyes . All right , now all we have to do is . Oh , no ! I should have known . See , when you use one artifact to try and find another artifact , especially one as powerful as the astrolabe , it gets very complicated . I see . Well , it 's a good thing this wasn 't actually Jack Duncan 's spur . Yeah , well ... It wasn 't ? No . I bought it at a thrift shop in Univille . I wasn 't sure of your intentions . Now I am . When did you start to suspect ? The first time I was here . You used the astrolabe . You foolish ... Selfish ... You 've released an evil that ... I did what I had to do . We 're done here . No more games ! Someone who 's trying to hurt me ? C 'mon . Uh . We heard you play here . You 're really good . Do you think anyone might be jealous ? Jealous of me ? Everybody here is good . Truth is , I 'm jealous of them . Well , has anyone given you any gifts lately ? Anything , um , unusual ? Or your trumpet ? How long have you had it ? No , nobody 's given me anything . I 've had my horn for years . We 're just trying to explain your illness . Good luck . In three months , the only thing the doctors think is that I 'm dying . No idea why . You know Billy Colfax ? So , he was a wicked good sax player . He had M.S. He said you just gotta play through the pain . It made him stronger . So that 's what I 'm gonna do . I 'm , I 'm gonna play through the pain . While I can . Excuse me . ( SIGHS ) We got a good newsl bad news thing . Good news , marble . Bad news , this one was a little too volatile to leave behind . Oh , great ! We 're starting a collection . I have to win the debate ! You ruined everything ! His dad thinks he 's in the boy 's room dry heaving . We gotta hurry . Where is Pete with the last marble ? We have to goo this bag now . Couldn 't agree more . Brade ? You okay ? Feels like my chest is about to explode . We 've got a wrinkle . Well , tell ' em . I don 't have the marble . It got confiscated . Confiscated ? By whom ? Marshall , the headmaster . I had a little anger thing in class . A little anger ! The master of understatement . And with this whole zero-tolerance thing this week , he , he took all my stuff . Said I could get it back after class . So , the headmaster has the last marble . Okay . And his big goals are what ? Probably kids getting a good education , right ? Or making more money at the bake sale ? Car wash ? I 'll bet he 's putting together a varsity car wash . So what 's our next move ? Well , we need to find the Headmaster and get that last marble . Okay . Hugo , you stay with the guys . Let 's get the school to shut down this I.M.T. Thing before it gets ugly . Thanks for letting me look at this . I can 't help but notice that , well , Ethan plays here every night . But three months ago , not , not at all . Oh , God , he didn 't wanna get up in front of a crowd till he got good . I mean , he hung out here all the time , but just watching . And he started getting good ... Oh , gosh , about two , three months ago . Right about the same time that he started getting sick . And did anything change ? Did he get a new teacher or ... Not that I know of . But you know , one night this old jazzman came in , and I remember because of the look on Ethan 's face as he listened to him . He was so enthralled . What was he saying ? He was saying that to really play , to play from your soul , you have to let your life 's pain out through your music . And to be a great jazz player , Ethan needed to experience more life . More , more pain . ( HORN BLOWING ) Ethan 's music is the most important thing to him , isn 't it ? It 's the only thing he thinks about . Wow , thanks . Okay , so if musicians , really good musicians , draw on , uh , life experience , pain or sorrow , fear . Yeah ? And all Ethan 's ever wanted to do is be a great musician . ( COUGHING ) You think that he 's doing this to himself ? Maybe he has an artifact , that allows him to play through the , the pain to become a real jazz player . ( COUGHING ) Even if it kills him . Well , Mr. Marshall went to the gym , of course . The last event of the I.M.T. Is always basketball . The whole school turns out . Okay , thanks . But I wouldn 't bother him . He was loaded for bear . The school board 's going to be there and he kept talking about how they were going to get theirs . I don 't think I 've ever heard him swear like that . Angry Headmaster has it in for the school board ? I didn 't say that . Budget cuts . He , he mentioned something about the , the school board , uh , doing some budget cutting . More like budget killing . Mr. Marshall knows this board would take down the whole school just to save a buck . But I didn 't say that , either . He 's going for the school board . And a gym full of kids . Alright , I 'll make my way to the gym . You go grab Hugo and meet me there , he knows his way around , he can help . Okay . ( CHEERING ) I don 't see him . I don 't see Marshall anywhere . CLAUDIA : Alright , well , I 've got Hugo , we 'll be on our way . Now , if the headmaster 's not in the gym ... No , no . Don 't worry about that , I know every nook and cranny of this school . I remember one time when I was 14 years old ... Uh , yeah ? More on that later . ( DEFIBRILLATOR CHARGING ) We won 't let you shut down the I.M.T. Brady , what are you doing ? We heard Agent Lattimer say that he was gonna shut down the I.M.T. And he can 't . Tilson has to win . You can 't just walk away from this . Maybe not . But I will not give you back the astrolabe . I don 't want it back . I want you to use it again . Undo everything I 've done ? No . Do you seriously believe you have a choice in any of this ? It should be your choice , too . There is a great deal more at stake than you know . ( COUGHS ) Ethan , you need to stop . Everybody 's a critic . We know what you 've been doing . You 've been stealing other people 's pain for yourself . Sounds like science fiction . Yeah . ( PANTING ) But you know it 's not . I also know I 'm not giving it up . No , don 't worry about the I.M.T. Go make sure Agent Lattimer isn 't shutting it down , and I won 't worry . You know I can 't do that . I 'm sorry , Uncle Huey . Tommy , go . There , that oughta hold ' em . What ? Wait ! Why did you do that ? What ? The world had lost hope ! The astrolabe was our only solution . You , you have to believe me . I tried to tell you ! I was there ? Oh , yes . Well , surely I told you you 'd be creating an evil . " An evil that I 'd have to live with the rest of my days . " Yes , you did . But I can handle it . What about the rest of us ? Will you condemn the rest of the world to live with your evil ? ( PANTING HEAVILY ) It 's okay . It 's what I want . ( COUGHING ) ( GROANS ) MYKA : Ethan ! Hey ! Hey , come on . ( PANTING ) But it 's killing you . It 's worth it . I can help you , too . No ! I can take away your pain . No , you can 't ! ( GROANS ) Oh , my God . What happened to you ? This is all my fault ! This isn 't your fault . Yes , it is my fault . Brady knew about the marbles because I showed them to him ! I told him how they worked ! What ? Why ? Why would you do something like that ? I didn 't mean for him to use them , but he 's smart . He 's special . Oh ! Oh , my god . You , you wanted him to become a Warehouse agent like you . That 's . That 's why you showed them to him . ( SIGHS ) What is this ? This is my pain . Please stop . Are you all right ? Uh-huh , yeah . I 'm just having a little trouble breathing . This is another downside ! What is wrong with me ? Why are you taking this out on yourself ? For 30 years I didn 't exist ! Then I got a second chance . But was that enough for me ? No ! I had to leave a legacy , Brady . I was greedy . No . Reckless , maybe . But not greedy . And I 'm , I 'm gonna be fine . I think . What if I 've run out of second chances ? What if the universe is making you and Brady pay for my mistakes ? ( GRUNTS ) Stop ! Stop ! You 're choking Claudia . You 're gonna kill her . What ? ( GRUNTS ) No ! ( PANTING ) ( SCREAMS ) ( GASPS ) There , see . Probably just a little bit of stress . I 'm fine , Brady 's gonna be fine in a minute and , by the way , I don 't think the universe hurts teenage boys to punish their wacky uncles . I did this to him . Hugo ? If Brady is going to become the Warehouse agent you hope he will be ... Yeah ? Then save him ! The only way we 're gonna help him if we find the Headmaster and that last marble . So , we need you , Hugo . We 're running out of time . I will not undo what I have done . The Brotherhood is more powerful than you think . I work for some pretty powerful people myself . You came into my house and stole from me . Dismantled my life 's work . And I will respond in kind . Things have already been set in motion . And unlike your Regents , we follow no rules . We do whatever has to be done . ( FARNSWORTH RINGING ) Yeah ? Guys ? We got a code red . The entire school 's here , and no one can find the Headmaster , okay ? And , and my vibes are off the charts , and ... Oh , crap . It 's the school board . The Headmaster 's targets ? If this guy 's planning on getting revenge in here , there 's gonna be a whole lot of kids caught in the crossfire . This is a lot of kids . Yeah , and I don 't need vibes to know this is gonna get bad . Look , Hugo , if the headmaster had a weapon , like , I don 't know , a rifle or something , is there any place he could hide to get a clean shot ? Everything 's exposed . Well , he 's here somewhere . No . There was only one place we could ... Pete . Yeah ? That door . PETE : Where does it lead ? The furnace room . Which is where ? Underneath the gym . Alright , look . You guys stay here . Keep looking for him , in case he shows up . ( GRUNTS ) You 're in my way . ( GRUNTS ) Stay right there . Someone has to stop the board from tearing this school apart , program-by-program . What is that stuff ? Before I was an administrator , I was a chemistry teacher . Another program they wanna cut ! The furnace will turn this compound into a gas in 60 seconds . The school board is sitting right under the vents in the gym . And that will be that ! They 're not the only ones in there ! You 're , you 're gonna poison the whole damn student body ! Collateral damage . I need to stop the board . That 's the goal . It 's good to have goals . ( SCREAMS ) ( GRUNTS ) Now , that 's how you knock somebody out . Yeah . So if this stuff turns into gas . No ! Pete , you 've got to shut down the furnace before that happens . Uh ... I got it . ( EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST ) It 's all wires and circuits and stuff . Hang tight , I 'll be right down . No , Claud ! No . You won 't make it in time ! Just get everybody out . ( SIGHS ) In case I can 't pull this off . Okay , Pete ! Come on , come on Pete . Think , think . Just focus . Focus . What do I need to focus ? The marble . Come on . Hey , there little buddy . I 'm gonna need your help , so please work . And don 't kill me . Okay . Alright , Heather , it was very nice . Heather , Heather , Heather , Heather and Heather ! Let 's not have a brain tumor for breakfast . Everybody out this way please . So , now , whatever you do , don 't panic . Trampling each other will only make it worse if the poison gas gets out ! Did you just say " poison gas " ? Yeah , it 's kind of a chemical reaction , you know , when the hydro ... Oh , my gosh ! Come on . Hugo ! What ? Probably best not to use words like poison or trampling ! Right . Okay , boys . Carry on . Alright , Mr. Davis . Eighth grade shop class . He told me to start with the ground . So ... Whoa ! Wow , that is so not un-cool . We 're never gonna get all these kids out of here in time . PETE : Whoa . Just , just , just a sec , Claudia . Pete , it 's a kind of a now or never situation . Okay , here we go . Um ... Okay . ( LAUGHS ) Oh , Mr. Davis ! Mr. Davis . Oh ! Thank you , thank you , thank you . Hey ! You got it , right ? Pete , your arm . Pete ? Pete ! Hi . Yeah , yeah . Let 's do this . What the hell was that ? Did I just ... Did I try to kill the ... No . Kill ? No . No , no , no . What did ... No well , maybe . What , what ... What 'd you have for lunch ? Nothing , just a salad . Salad . It 's mushrooms . Yep , mushrooms . It 's mushrooms . It 's all taken care of . It 's all ... It 's a big , bad batch . The government 's taking care of that , so ... Mushrooms . Oh . Good . Thanks . All right . Let 's go get that head taken care of , huh ? Claudia , thank you . Oh , hey , you were the one who figured out he was in the furnace room , so . Not about that . Before . Brady . Oh , yeah . Sure . Hugo ? When I was really young , my brother was reckless , and I lost him for a long time . You just got Brady into your life . Why would you wanna be reckless with that ? Right . Oh , right . Right . Hey ! ETHAN : My great-great-grandfather worked with Scott Joplin . Joplin left him the cigarette case , said it made him feel life more fully . That 's what he put in his music . So you thought the case was a shortcut to inspired music . I was helping myself , but those people , I helped them , too . People have the right to work through their pain on their own terms . To heal themselves . You have to learn how to live your own life , Ethan . I 'm 27 . It 's a good time to go . You know , my , my music would live on , Morrison , Hendrix , Janis Joplin , Cobain , Winehouse . It 's good company . DINA : It 's selfish . How dare you just decide to leave without thinking about the people in your life . The people who ... Who love you . Like who ? Okay , you 're not just selfish , you 're also blind . You like ... You like me ? I mean , I like you . I just didn 't think . ( SIGHS ) Musicians . Okay , there 's some , uh , life experience waiting for you right there . STEVE : I figured it out last week . Whenever I get hurt , Claudia feels the pain . The metronome might keep me alive , but ... But if something terrible happens to you , it happens to Claudia , too . And there had to be a price for Claudia bringing me back . But I won 't let Claudia pay with her own life . Well , what does she think about all this ? You haven 't talked to her yet . Right .

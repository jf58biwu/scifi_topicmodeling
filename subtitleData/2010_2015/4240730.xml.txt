 Previously on Alphas ... I couldn 't understand . They just kept saying the same thing over and over again . Tell me about the shooter . He was brainwashed . You did murder a federal prisoner . I couldn 't control that . The best place for you now is with us . I 've always been better off on my own . So this is how we deal with Alphas ? When things go wrong , we assassinate ? It 's not what I signed up for . Red Flag must have used her to encode some of their transmissions . You work for Red Flag . No , Gary , they work for me . Are you really my friend ? Of course I 'm your friend . Gary , I know you like Anna . But remember , I 'm your friend too . Yeah , I know . But you 're not one of us . Great report . If you like fiction . Well , I 'm sure Agent Nathan Cley will be more than happy to fill in the blanks . I 'm sure he will too considering he 's already raising hell over at the DOD . You think I 'm gonna let this slide ... . Then you 've really misjudged me too . A man with your abilities could make a lot of money , if he went into business for himself . It 's never gonna happen . I don 't care what Cley says . This was a bad idea . Yes , we do seem to be learning by trial and error , hmm . Mostly error . Things aren 't going to get easier , are they ? You 're late . You 're not with the committee . No . I 'm not . You 're one of them , aren 't you ? Some mistakes never go away .

But I need your help with something in the office . It 's the New York Auto Show at the Javitz Center , and it takes four days to see everything . Four , that 's why I took off today . Gary , don 't dawdle , come on . I 've already seen all the English , French , German , and Italian cars . I 'm working my way east . And today 's Asia , 'cause there 's a system . I know how much it means to you to see the car show , but I promise you won 't miss that much . Yeah , ' cause tomorrow 's America . You know Americans still make a lot of cars . Like that one . What are they doing here ? I don 't know . Get down , get down , get down ! [ Gunshots ] [ Sighs ] Damn it . Agent Harken . Hey , tactical . Have we got a case ? Nah , you don 't . But we do . Bag him . - [ Yells ] - Hey ! Alphas . [ Laughs , snorts ] I 've never seen it . Come on , everybody 's seen Casablanca . It 's the greatest love , bar , spy , tuxedo movie ever made . I figured you for more of Field of Dreams type of guy . Nope , never seen it . I refuse to believe Mr. Baseball hasn 't seen Field of Dreams . Mm-mm , I won 't go see any movie that I know is gonna make me cry . If one sneaks up on me , that 's fine . A little while back , I took Tyler to see that movie , uh , Up . Totally sideswiped me . [ Laughs ] But I 'm not doing that to myself on purpose . I thought Casablanca had a sad ending . Oh , no . Bogie was much better off with Claude Rains . [ Rachel screams ] Rachel ! Rachel ! [ Gunshots ] Run ! [ Sighs ] [ Sighs ] [ Groans ] [ Electronic buzzing and blips ] [ Electronic buzzing and blips ] What the- - [ gasping ] Dr. Rosen ! [ Muffled ] Dr. Rosen ! Help ! [ Groans ] I demand to know what 's going on . [ Over speaker ] You 're not in a position to make any demands , Lee . The cells you 're in are soundproof . [ Electronic buzzing and blips ] Signal proof . Escape proof . Alpha proof . Nathan ? What have you done ? You 're in Binghamton , along with the rest of your team . And you 're going to be here until I find out which one of you is the traitor . [ key pad beeps ] Come on . Let 's go . This way . Dr. Rosen ! Keep walking . What are you doing ? Nathan , have you lost your mind ? When Sullivan hears about this- - This was Sullivan 's call . She ordered you to tranquilize us like animals ? That was my call . I don 't want anyone else getting dead on account of your team . Nathan , you still haven 't told us what we 're accused of . Harold Freeman , Mitchell Stentz , Karl Baxter . Sound familiar ? Yes , of course . Scientists who work for MK Ultra . The Cold War Alphas program , they were all part of it . What about them ? They were your predecessors in a way . Recently deceased . Nathan , don 't be coy with me . Just tell me what 's happening . Each of them were killed late yesterday by a quick-moving necrosis that spread through their veins in a matter of seconds . No toxins detected , no puncture marks , so ... I can tell you none of my team has this ability . No , the ability belongs to an assassin who works for Red Flag . But you do have access to the MK Ultra files . The unredacted ones . The ones with real names , addresses . Well , I don 't know what that proves . They 've been in my possession for years . Except each of these received a call from your office only hours before they died . Encoded with the original MK Ultra signs and countersigns . Your phones . Codes you and yours had almost exclusive access to . Someone in your group identified these old men and set them up to die . Nathan , if anyone 's being set up , it 's us . There are any number of ways these could have been faked . Phone taps , hackers , not to mention Alpha abilities . Occam 's razor . The simplest explanation is usually the right one . All the evidence points back to you or someone from your team . Red Flag tried to kill me , Nathan , and my team . You think one of us is suddenly a sympathizer ? Sympathizer ... Double Agent , mole , financial opportunist ... They all mean traitor . Nathan , I know my team- - better than you , better than anyone- - and I trust them completely . I 'm reading evasion . Pain and contempt . He doesn 't like you . What you just said , that wasn 't the truth . Look , I 'm not working for Red Flag . I 'm not helping Red Flag . I don 't know these gray hairs . And I sure as hell don 't have any reason to want them dead . Seriously , come on , who kills an 80-year-old man ? What 's the point ? Just wait a few months . He 's being honest . I think . I mean , it 's not 100 % . I told you that . Red Flag had you kill before . It wasn 't me . It was mind control . So you admit to being susceptible to mind control . Well , you want me to say that maybe I 'm working for Red Flag and I don 't know . Well ... Considering the things I 've seen in the last few months , can 't rule it out . I feel that while significant strides have been made in expanding the use of her ability , she still lacks the emotional maturity required to realize her full potential . That 's just rude . Dark glasses in a meeting . I could sit behind you . Or blindfold you if you 'd rather go that route . Scared of making eye contact with the evil mind-bending Alpha ? Have it your way . Got to wonder . Full potential . What do you think Dr. Rosen meant by that ? I don 't know , maybe that I , uh ... I could go a week or two without pushing someone . Actually pay rent on my loft . Drive a car I didn 't borrow . So you admit to being a thief and a con artist ? I 've been working for the D.O.D. for years . Haven 't had any problems with my lifestyle until now . Disillusionment doesn 't happen overnight . Those roots take time to grow , and when they do , small buds appear . You think we don 't know what happened with Skylar Adams ? Helping Skylar was the right thing to do . No remorse . None . So basically , you just go around doing whatever the hell you want . Damn the consequences . I told you . Anna is my friend . And there 's no rule against talking to your friends . It 's sign that I 'm improving my social interactions . Your friend is a Red Flag terrorist . Yeah , I know that . But we don 't talk about work . You 're hiding your signals . I know you are , 'cause I can feel them , but I--I can 't reach them . So you never said anything to Anna about the MK Ultra program ? No , that would be work . When you interrogate people , it 's very important to pay attention to what they say . So what do you talk about ? It 's private . That means that it 's none of your business . That woman hurt people , Mr. Bell . She 's dangerous . No , that 's not true . Anna has never hurt anyone . Yeah , she hurt me one time , but then she apologized . And she says that Red Flag doesn 't want to hurt people either . It 's just sometimes they have to to protect other Alphas . That 's people like me . You 're a signal bully . That sucks . Anyway , you hurt people too . You hurt me with some sleeping bullets . And I didn 't want to go to sleep . I just woke up . [ Over earpiece ] I can 't read him . His expressions , inflections- - they 're all over the place . Now you and I both know I 'm not Red Flag . How many different ways you want me to tell you this ? Hey , I know you 're not the mole . Oh , now you I can read . That was a lie . Look , we had to bring you in along with everyone else . Otherwise they would have been suspicious . Well , you shot me , what--18 times ? You did a really good job selling that . You and I are more alike than what you want to admit . Guys saddled with jobs they don 't particularly want . Working with people we can 't completely trust . You can 't actually sit there and tell me none of your coworkers fits the profile of someone who might go over to the other side . You know what , if they didn 't before , you are sure driving them in that direction . That 's a very qualified answer , Agent Harken . We 're on the verge of making a massive move against Red Flag . And your team has a mole that could jeopardize the entire initiative . Are you telling me you don 't want to identify that person ? You 're a trained investigator . You 've got to suspect someone . Who 's tops on your list ? Mr. Hicks ? Ms. Theroux ? Okay , yeah . People in the office say bad things about the government . But Nina doesn 't mean anything by it . Not that I 'm singling out Nina . We all say bad things about the government . That 's not what I meant either . Ms. Pirzad . Relax . I am relaxed . It 's just ... we all worry that , one day , men in black will swoop in and , well , we 'll end up here . We 're afraid of this . Of today . Ask her if she has a boyfriend yet . Isn 't she a little young for you ? Excuse me ? Never mind . [ Heartbeat pulses ] There 's someone behind the glass . I wouldn 't worry about that . Who 's there ? I know someone 's there . I can hear your heartbeat . Hi , Rachel . It 's Eric . Long time . Eric Letrobe ? I know him . We brought him here two years ago . Eric , what are you doing ? I 'm reading your micro-expressions . So far , so good . Cley said if I help out , he 'll get me out of this dump . So maybe once I get out , you and I can catch a movie . Eric , can you please tell Cley that I 'm telling the truth ? Or maybe go to a show . Les Miz , or The Producers . 'Cause I know a guy . Eric , I don 't even think those shows are running anymore . If the two are you are done , I 'm trying to conduct an investigation . More like a witch hunt . It 's not a witch hunt if one of you is guilty . And one of you is . Unless you 're wrong . And then you 're turning friends into enemies . Is that a threat ? What do you want me to tell you ? I--I know who the mole is ? I don 't . You want me to pick someone at random ? Hicks . He 's handsome . Too handsome . Time to change the plan . Hey , Gary . - You okay ? - No . So what 's next , huh ? What are they gonna do ? What does Cley want ? Hey , Rachel , just try to calm down . I am calm , okay , Bill ? You don 't seem that calm . Why are you letting him do this to us ? I 'm not letting him do this , Nina . This is--this is Cley 's game . - Game ? - Yes . Well , he 's obviously interviewed all of us individually and hasn 't found a suspect . So he 's brought us all here together . Anyone could have accessed our computers . The invisible girl ... No , I checked . No one but us has ever read those MK Ultra files . So we 're his only suspects . Everybody relax . None of us works for Red Flag . Cley says that- - that I 'm the informant because I talk to Anna . - What , you still talk to Anna ? - Yeah . But I don 't tell her anything . Gary , what do you talk to Anna about ? Well , I don 't talk about work . Gary , you shouldn 't be doing that . No , I just told her about my new jacket , that it sucked . You guys , listen . Cley has a plan , all right ? His initial interrogation didn 't work , so he put us together like this for one reason , and that 's so we can find out amongst ourselves who the traitor is . - There is no traitor . - Well ... Obviously they think there is . And what if we don 't ? If you don 't , I 'll have no choice . I 'll send every one of you to building seven . He can 't do that . Do I even want to know ? Building seven , it 's ... Where they send the worst of the worst . And once an Alpha goes in ... They never come out . We 'll get out of this , okay ? What do you think they do in building seven ? Seriously , Nina , when I dream about it , I 'm on some sort of a metal table . And there are these shadowy figures with sharp objects , but I can 't see them . Even with my ability , I can 't see them . Rachel , are you gonna sit here and talk about your damn dreams ? We need to be figuring out how the hell we 're gonna get out of here . - Bill , not helping . - Yeah ... Pissing and moaning 's really helping . Harken , you 're amped up . Just chill out . I 'm in Binghamton , okay ? And my wife doesn 't know where I am . I 've no idea when we 're going to get out of here . So it 's a little more than just being amped up . Okay , you know what , Bill ? You need to please calm down . You Dr. Rosen now ? We all need to calm down . Bill doesn 't like being in jail . He likes putting people in jail . It 's two different things . All right , Bill , you 're a cop , so- - I am a Special Agent . There 's a difference . All right . Now what I want to know is , does this actually work ? You put your suspects in a room and you see who breaks . It works all the time . You put the suspects in a room just like this . You make them sweat , and then you watch them wait . - Wait for what ? - You wait to see who 's calm . It 's usually the calm guy that 's guilty . Oh , you gotta be kidding me . Well , Bill is never calm . He can 't be calm . It 's biologically impossible . - And Rachel 's always nervous . - Hey . And I 'm agitated and have a bad attitude . So we 're innocent . The three of us are innocent . Let 's go . Bill , come on . You can drive me home . Gary ... No , come on . I 'm opening the door . Gary , they 're not just going to let us out , okay . And plus it 's more than just seeing who sweats . Cley 's got Eric Letrobe with him . One of your ex-patients , Doc ? No , not exactly . An Alpha we found . He reads faces . He uses his ability to con people and win at poker games . Perfect ... Hey , Eric ! How 's life treating you in here , huh ? Nice and comfy ? The food 's crap . I 've had it before . It 's not that bad . Look me in the eye and say that . - Oh ! Ah ! - You all right ? Ah , I just ... Eh , it 's my back . That dam cot is just- - Okay , you know what , we need to get him out of here now . Yes , I think we--we all need to get out of here . Okay . [ Groans ] Oh , this is not all right . All right , we need a doctor in here now . She 's worried , and the pain is real . Wonderful . [ Moans ] Ah , my back is out . I need a spasmolytic methocarbamol . Okay , his muscles are in spasm . Let 's get him down to medical . Can I get a gurney , please . Put the rest of them in their cells . Let 's go . Yeah , I 'm going . Hey , don 't touch me ! No one 's supposed to touch me . Hey , tell them to be careful with Dr. Rosen , okay . He 's in pain . Just keep moving . You 're making a serious mistake . Hey ! Eyes front . [ Number pad beeping ] Come on , pal . This is no time to act stupid . Got all the time in the world . [ Buzzing ] That 's the best you can do ? Get in . Get in ! Unh ! [ Beeping ] They 're all the same . Aah ! Go to sleep . Let 's go ! [ Electrical buzzing ] Lock it down now . [ Alarms blaring ] I hear someone . Okay , they 're coming from the hall . - Ah ! - Let 's go . Thank you , doctor . I 'll get the medication on the way out . The pain was real , but I guess he was exaggerating a bit . Really . [ Grunts ] Aah ! Come on , come on , come on . Come on . We gotta hurry up , because they 're inside , coming . [ Gun cocking ] Say the word . Who do I drop ? Say the word . They 're all within range . I just need a target . Stand down . You 're letting them go ? Six assets , one traitor . I 'm not a wasteful man . We 'll adjust . The FBI busted a smuggling ring out of here . Some Somali gun runners . This place has been vacant ever since . Yes , well , are you certain no one will think to look for us here ? Wasn 't my case , so I shouldn 't be tracked to this . Hicks , I need you to secure the rest of these exits . I 'm on it . Gary , what do you see ? There 's wireless cameras far away . There 's some trucks ' CBS , radio--there 's Wi-Fi . There 's satellite TV . All right . Doors are chained shut . Now what , Bill ? I 'm not heading back to Binghamton . We need to keep moving or split up . Give ourselves a chance to get away . Get away to where ? Can 't go home , can 't go back to the offices . Ah ! Nobody 's going anywhere until we figure out who this traitor is . We don 't even know there is one . Hicks , there are three people dead , and they were lured to their death by calls from our office . So unless it 's the UPS guy , it 's gotta be somebody in this room . No , it couldn 't be the UPS guy . The MK Ultra files are on the cloud server . You have to have a password to get on there . Did you guys look at those poor old men ? It was horrible . I wouldn 't too many tears . Did you read those files ? Human experimentation , forced drug trials . They didn 't exactly treat their patients with kid gloves . Then you 're admitting that you had access to these files . Yeah , Bill , I read the files . They 're on the server . I read everything on there . Yeah , I read them too , Bill . I feel so left out . I basically use it to check box scores . You want us to believe that you 're the only one that didn 't have access to these files ? Sorry to disappoint . But you know , I can tell you the era and the whip for the entire Giants pitching staff . Fear the beard . I don 't know what that means , Hicks , come on . Okay , so what now ? We interrogate each other ? Oh , Nina , you can push everybody . - Rachel- - - No , that would work . 'Cause you couldn 't push me . And , Nina , you can 't push yourself , can you ? That wouldn 't make sense . No , it doesn 't make any sense . Bill 's in overdrive . He can probably ignore you . And I 've spent eight years learning how to avoid your influence , so ... [ Groans ] Are you still hurting , Dr. Rosen ? Nothing that a swim and a hot bath and a good night 's sleep won 't cure . I know how to find the traitor . - What ? - How ? Get me a phone , then I 'll call Anna . You 're gonna ask the head of Red Flag who the informant is . Yeah , I 'll ask Anna . This Anna thing , we 're really gonna need to talk about . Gary , you can 't talk to Anna . Hey , guys , guys , I got this , okay ? I 've interrogated hundreds of suspects in the past , okay . It 's very simple . You just go through the last few days , you make a timeline . Good old-fashioned police work , all right . Now I don 't need any mind control to do it . Nobody needs mind control or anything like that as I know who the traitor is . Yeah ? You found them ? Scranton . All right , send the coordinates to my phone . I say you could touch the station ? That is some misplaced hostility . Doc , come on . Are you gonna tell us , or are you gonna make us guess ? I 'm trying to decide how to handle this . It 's not easy . I care about all of you . And to be honest , I 'm deeply disappointed . Well , it wasn 't me . I didn 't do it , so it must be someone else here . Gary doesn 't lie . We all know Gary doesn 't lie . No , I do lie . I 've been practicing . It 's a social skill . Like the other day when I said I was going to have a pudding pop . I was lying , ' cause I don 't like pudding pops . That was a lie . I do like pudding pops . Gary ... I just knew we didn 't have any . Well , I 'm hoping that the traitor will , for lack of a better word , confess . - Cley 's almost here . - What ? - He 's on the phone . - How ? There 's a spy satellite tracking us . Gary , you just telling us this now ? Yeah , I just found out right now , Bill . He 's on his way . - All right , Doc . - 20 minutes away . Okay , we should run . Steal another car . Seriously , I can 't go back to Binghamton , Dr. Rosen . I can 't do it . Running away would be pointless , obviously . So , if the person , whoever is responsible for this , would step forward , I 'll know that they are redeemable . And I will do everything that I can to protect them . If not , I have no other choice but to turn them over to Cley myself . And we , uh , have 20 minutes . No , we have less than 20 minutes . [ Tires squealing ] ] Yep , this is the car they stole . Satellite lost track when they moved into the industrial park . Well , there have to be 40 or 50 warehouses around here . - Anything ? - Noise . Between the train depot and the factories down the street , there 's too much clatter . They 're cornered . Eventually they always end up cornered . We 'll go warehouse to warehouse . Hunt them down , flesh them out , take them down . Start all over again with Eric . Sooner or later , one of them will crack . All right , I 'll wait here . You come and get me if you find them . - Nope . - Man , where 's the trust ? You can tell what people are thinking , who do you trust ? Let 's go . Okay , whoever did this , just come forward and confess . I promise we will forgive you . Doc says he already knows who it is . So why don 't you can the theatrics . Hey , what is that supposed to mean ? It means stop babbling ! Cameron , just dial it down a bit , okay ? You 're looking pretty jumpy there , Hicks . Says a guy who 's sweatin through his shirt ? Yeah , I sweat , okay ? I sweat when I 'm amped up , okay ? You 're amped up . Maybe crush a crate . Maybe that 'll help you . Yeah , how about I crush you ? Guys , guys , I can hear headsets . They 're searching for us . They 're going to be here very soon . Hey , is there a bathroom around here ? Hey , it 's my downside . When I get nervous I have to pee . No , your downside is you 're a distrustful , depressed miserable human being . Oh , yeah . That . You know what people don 't realize ? That ignorance of what other people are thinking is one of the keys to human happiness . Lets you have friends , lovers . Lets you keep a job . You know , they told me this office thing was a fast-track to a cushy position in D.C. House in the burbs , good schools for my kids . Still livin in upstate New York . I feel your pain , brother . Somehow that didn 't make me feel any better . Come on , let 's get this done . So , people , time 's up . Okay , so who is it ? He doesn 't know . You 're bluffing , right ? Look , for all we know , it 's Cley . Or someone above his head . Someone is setting us up to take the fall . It can 't be Cley . He doesn 't have access to our passwords- - he doesn 't have access that we know of . He doesn 't have access , Hicks . She 's right . It 's not Cley . - I 'm sorry , Cameron . - What ? I know about the cash deposits to your secret accounts . Gary told me . Hicks . The deposits are cash , but they email statements . And its different amounts . - There 's $ 3,120 , $ 1,960 . - No , listen to me . You don 't understand . Different times of the month . It 's for my kid . Cameron . No . Seem pretty nervous there , Hicks . Yeah , you 're damn right I am . I should have never let you on this team in the first place . Should have sent him to Binghamton a long time ago . I knew it . I knew it was you . - Bill , don 't ! - No , no , no ! [ Both grunting ] [ Overlapping shouts ] That 's enough ! Just let him go , please . Unh ! Are you okay ? Bill ! I didn 't do it . - Bill ! - Aah ! No , no , no , no ! Bill ! Bill ! Stop fighting ! Hicks , stop ! Unh ! - Get on the ground ! - Get down ! Hands up ! Down on the ground . It 's Hicks . I need to get Gary out of here . - Get him on the ground ! - It 's not him ! Back up ! Back up ! It 's not Hicks , okay , it 's not him . Dr. Rosen , they were fighting each other . I know . Come on , Gary . Friends aren 't supposed to fight . Hey , Doc , remember me ? Not now . - Down on the ground now . - Okay , stop , everybody . It 's Rosen . He 's the mole . What are you talking about . Rosen just said it was Hicks . That man is an imposter . His blood type is wrong . That 's not Dr. Rosen . [ Car accelerating ] Oh , God , he 's got Gary . [ Toilet flushes ] [ Cell phone beeps ] About time . You know what they call it when you die in your sleep ? Millionaire 's death . Creighton wanted you alive to take the fall . Looks like that 's changed . I love to improvise . [ Squishing sound ] Uh ! Oh ... Dr. Rosen , we should go back and help our friends . Gary , I 've told you we are helping them . And the best way to do that is to erase the MK Ultra files from the cloud server- - But you said the MK Ultra files are important . They are . And you 're the only one who can do that . Yeah , well if they 're important , why delete them ? It doesn 't make- - Oh , that 's gross . Dr. Rosen , don 't do that in there . - Are you sick ? - No , I 'm fine . No , you 're not fine . Vomit is the body 's way of telling us we 're not fine . Do you ever shut up ? Come on , Gary . But that won 't grow anymore now , Dr. Rosen . It 's delicate . It 's a philodendron . Come on . Come on , Gary . Gary ... Yeah , it got warm . [ Keyboard clicking ] How long is this going to take ? To erase every file all at once ? It 'll take a while . 'Cause the connection 's slow . And the IP address , it keeps changing . That 's why I 'm the only one who can delete them all , because I 'm the admin . Don 't do that in the plant . Go and do that in the bathroom . Don 't worry about me . Just concentrate on your work . Gary ? Step away from that man . He 's not me . No . No . No . You 're not Dr. Rosen . Your hair is too short . I know , Gary . He must have cut it . Why I don 't know . To measure my skull , to match the color of my hair . It 's not important , Gary . What 's important is that this man ... This man 's an Alpha . Don 't listen to him . That 's the only possible explanation for how he looks like me . No , no , he ... His face is moving . Yeah , you 're not Dr. Rosen . That 's his Alpha ability . He can change his face . Yes , you 're right , Gary . And his entire bone structure . And even the color of his skin , his vocal cords . I imagine it must be incredibly painful holding another shape like this . It 's no picnic being you , that 's for sure . All hunched up , pretending to be so damned understanding . Well , why don 't you let it go ? I 'll kill him , you little brat ! No , no , no , you won 't because you need me to delete those MK Ultra files . But I won 't . I 'm not going to help you because you helped Red Flag kill those three MK Ultra people . Three of them ! You killed Freeman , Baxter and and Stentz ? Yeah , they 're dead . I saw the pictures . They were the last three remaining staff members of the program . While you make me out to be a traitor , you wipe out MK Ultra ... Why ? What 's in those files ? What is it you don 't want me to see ? - Stop ! - No , no , no , no ! - Dr. Rosen ... - Gary ! - Dr. Rosen 's got a gun . - Where is he ? I don 't know what he 's going to do , but he 's the mole . He 's down there . I don 't know what he 's going to try and do , but he 's the mole . Gary , just slow down . Anna told me . We should leave . That 's not Gary ! Oh ! Ah ! [ Chuckling ] [ In British accent ] Oh , God . I 'm so damned tired . Look , I 'm not the traitor here , all right ? You all are . You 've sided against your own kind . And now you 're nothing but government thugs . Was that necessary ? No , but you know what , it feels really good . Where is Gary ? I 'm here . It 's the real me . That 's the fake me . He was fake Rosen before , but the real Dr. Rosen is here now . His leg hurts , and he has bad hair . So the Alpha who tried to kill me ? Gone by the time we got there . But your theory seems sound . Kill the MK Ultra players , erase the data , leave you holding the bag . Yeah , well whatever Red Flag was looking for in those MK Ultra files , or whatever they were trying to bury , must have been pretty important . Important enough for that morphogene to risk his life for it . True believer . Had him shipped straight to building seven . Eric , why exactly are you here ? His idea . Eric 's getting out of Binghamton soon . I thought you two could work together from time to time . Oh , really . Call it work release . Hey , he meant that . That was sincere . It 's like ... we bonded . Don 't push it . Hey , Doc , I 'm--I 'm your man . Even part time , freelance . Well , I 'll keep it in mind , Eric . More honesty . That is ... It 's so refreshing . All right . I 'll be in the car . Don 't try to run . Why would I run ? I got a job offer waiting . You know , Nathan , I was a little dismayed at the way you treated my team . Tranqing them like they were rabid dogs . Throwing them into cages . You set a very dangerous precedent doing that . Lee , you had a mole . A Red Flag Agent inside your team . If I hadn 't acted quickly and decisively , you would have been dead or framed . Or both . And I 'm supposed to thank you for that ? You could . Or you could worry about how Red Flag is gonna come at you next . Because they will . Rachel . I 'll call you . Well , I thought he was pretty cute . Really ? Yeah , those bank deposits were cash .

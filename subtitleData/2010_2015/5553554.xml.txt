 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... You 've collected quite a few artifacts . Yeah , enough to even up the odds . An enemy with an arsenal of artifact weapons would not only be dangerous- - But they could be unstoppable . I want you to feel the pain , like I have . It 's an astrolabe ... that 'll buy us back 24 hours . You can tell no one . - Damn it , they 're gone . - Too late . You wanted to save him , so save him , damn it ! Breathe ! That hat was itchy , huh ? It 's a great picture , though . - Did you get all your stuff ? - This is the last of it . You know , I don 't know what 's creepier , the fact that all my stuff was sent to the Dead Agents Vault , or that there is a Dead Agents Vault . Why don 't we focus on the fact that you 're not in the Dead Agents Vault ? Pollyanna . So , mission briefing in Artie 's office ? Yeah , Pete 's all worked up about something . Hot water . Okay , people , now that we 're back to five at the BB , we need to talk about the bathroom situation . Pete ? It 's an old house . You can 't take 30-minute showers . Uh , uh , uh , Leena . The 1 / 2 power shower is a sacred thing , okay ? Also , I used the rest of the peppermint body scrub . - Oh , that was mine . - Well , you weren 't using it . That 's because I was dead . Oh , you 're gonna play that card . Right now I 'm wishing I was dead . - This is the mission briefing ? - No . No , it isn 't . Leena , uh , this is from the ovoid quarantine . It doesn 't like anyplace I put it , so can you- - All right , we got a ping this morning from Devil 's Lake , North Dakota . Ooh , same barren landscape as South Dakota , but colder . A cleaning lady showed up at the hospital . She had all the symptoms of a spider bite , but there were no actual marks . The venom that was found inside her system turned out to be from an incredibly rare South American spider called the- - Theraphosa leblondi . The ther- - please tell me that 's not just a random lucky guess . Are you gonna be psychic now too ? That 's really gonna get annoying . No , no , no . I 've seen the artifact that does this . It 's a small wooden token . Well , where did you see it ? In the hangar . It belonged to Walter Sykes . Steve , you spent a long time with Walter Sykes , and he had an arsenal of artifacts . And he was firing them at us . - Where would he have kept them ? - He stored them in these crates labeled " A-to-Z Technologies , " but by the time he moved them , I was ... dead . But when we raided the hangar , there was nothing there . They could have stored them at Devil 's Lake . Well , it is only a four-hour drive . He could have had Marcus take them there before he came to the BB . - Or Tyler . - No , Tyler was ... Well , actually he was ... - Pete ! - Okay , I got the spider lady 's route from the cleaning service . She was at these three residences in Devil 's Lake yesterday . That one . The Mazzanti residence . Artie , Enrico Mazzanti , he was the original illustrator of Carlos Collodi 's- - - Pinocchio . - And Sykes was obsessed with Collodi 's bracelet . Safe house . You two go check it out . Be--be careful . 'Cause if that house actually has an arsenal of artifacts , - it could be a powder keg . - Okay . Ah ! Pete , you could have just picked the lock . Well , better safe than sorry , Mykes . Plus , I love doing that . - Pete . - Yup ? Check this out . Yeah , I 'm not really seeing the Sykes family resemblance . These are just the pictures that come in the frames . That 's why the cleaning lady only came once a month . This place was just for appearances . Temporary digs for him to hide out after his mega-bomb blew us all to kingdom come , huh ? Let 's just find the rest of Sykes 's toys , and--and we can close the book on this loser for good . - Okay . - Okay . Ugh . Plastic . He really was evil . Oh , great . A creepy basement . Gotcha . Theraphosa leblondi . Myka ! Pete , you found the artifacts ? Empty . Somebody beat us to the prize . 4x03 - Personal Effects - So , that 's a bird cage , violin , golf clubs , and some junk from our basement . Eh , they belonged to my grandma . They 're antiques . Probably worth thousands . Then why pawn them to me ? Oh , I thought this was one of those places where you sell things for money , but I guess I 'm just in , like , the worst bakery ever . I 'll take them someplace else . Okay , okay . Don 't get all ruffled . Let me check my price guides in the back . What the hell ? Give you 400 for the bunch . Are you kidding me ? That 's not enough . That 's not nearly enough . Kid , it 's just a bunch of junk . Oh , for crying out loud . All right , 600 . - 700 . - 650 . Fine . Jeez . Now what about the pipe you got behind your back ? This is mine . 640 then . The artifacts are gone ? All of them ? Maybe Sykes had somebody grab them in case something happened to him , you know , like a--a backup plan to his backup plan . No , Marcus and Tyler were the only other two I ever saw work with him . And they 're both dead . Well , whoever did it must have dropped the spider bite artifact on the way out . Yeah , but why smash the crates ? Why not just take the whole thing ? Probably too obvious . - Pete . - Yeah ? Look at this . - Yeah , an alarm system . - So if there was a break-in , why didn 't the security company come ? - Maybe the alarm didn 't go off . - Or maybe whoever did it - knew the code . - The padlocks don 't have codes , which would explain why they had to force open the door to the basement . That alarm company 's Safeco Security . Their office is in downtown Devil 's Lake . I 'm sending you the address right now . What are you doing talking to us ? You got the address , go . Hello . Well , hello . Shouldn 't you be eating doughnuts ? Dr. Oz says tomatoes are a superfood . We 're here to ask you a few questions . Excellent . You want to grab a drink or something ? About the break-in at the Mazzanti residence . I can 't give out that kind of information . United States Secret Service . Ah , let me just get my ... supervisor . So if you just wait right here- - Think he 's hiding something ? Either that or the burrito 's on its way out . Owoo ! We 've got the place surrounded ! Oh , please don 't arrest me , please , please ! All right , who stole the boxes , huh ? - Did Sykes hire you ? - What ? Who ? Walter Sykes , the owner of the house that you broke into . No , no , the whole thing was Jesse 's idea . Jesse ? Who 's Jesse ? Jesse Ashton . I went to high school with him . We were drinking last week at PJ Whelihan 's . Jesse said that he needed money , so I gave him the codes . Oh , God , I need a lawyer , don 't I ? Do you know a lawyer ? Wait , so you have nothing to do with Walter Sykes ? No . Who ? I-I can 't go to prison . All right , so Jesse takes everything that 's there , - then what ? - He says he knows a place where he can sell it , and that we 'd split the money . You know , the History channel 's got to stop glamorizing the pawn industry . Makes it easy . We bag the artifacts , we 're back in time for dinner . - Uh-oh . - What ? Bad vibe . I think we 're gonna be late for dinner . Hey . Wow . Yeah , blew out the whole window . No , I mean this pawn shop doesn 't look anything like the one on that TV show . See , that 's what I 've been saying . Oh , hey , Leena . - Look at you , out in the field . - No , no , no , this is all wrong . - Yeah . - Okay , these headphones cannot be next to this mask like this , and this iron should never lay flat . Yeah , see , with all these artifacts in play , I wanted Leena here to ... do whatever it is Leena does . Eh , no , no , no , the more , the merrier . We 're gonna need extra hands on this one . So what happened ? Ah , well , the owner gave this a jingle- - Ah-nuh-uhh ! That made the fireball . This is Mrs. O 'Leary 's cowbell . I thought the cow kicking over a lantern , that was just a made up story . No , the lantern 's a made up story . It 's the bell that caused the Great Chicago Fire . In fact , it was this bell that was in the doorway of a bakery shop that caused the Great Fire of London in 1666 . Well , the owner is singed , but he 'll live . Eh , Sykes had more artifacts than these . Where are the rest of them ? Well , you can thank rising consumer confidence for that . The owner already sold six of them . There 's six artifacts out there loose in one city ? This is a disaster . Fortunately , everybody pays by credit card these days . So in a few minutes , we 'll have names and addresses . What could be easier ? Eesh , no , don 't say " easy . " We 'll miss dinner completely . We do have one more problem . The owner said that the guy who sold him the artifacts , Jesse Ashton , actually kept one for himself . An old smoking pipe . It could be Sir Walter Raleigh 's . It allows you to travel through small bod- - No , no , no , I snagged that in the ' 80s . Although ... Admiral Byrd 's pipe is still missing . Look , for all we know it could be Cheech and Chong 's , but since he kept it , it looks like our hoodrat house burglar thinks he might have an artifact . Okay , you two go after him , and- - uh , Claudia , you and Steve take half this list and get the sunglasses , bird cage , and waffle iron . Leena and I will take the other half and get the golf clubs and violin . Pete , you and Myka get that pipe . And let 's do it fast , otherwise this town is gonna have a very bad day . But , wait ! We gotta do something about these artifacts . Well , maybe he just took the pipe - because he wanted to look cool . - Smoking a pipe isn 't cool . What ? Hey , Dan Akroyd smokes a pipe . Oh , well , that changes everything then . You know , I hope that Jesse 's as dopey as his accomplice . Careful , Mykes , Mykes . We still don 't know what the pipe does . You go . Well , I 'm guessing one thing it does is remove ceilings . So , first mission for Donovan and Jinks since the big sleep . - You excited ? - Yeah , sure . I can tell . You 're practically bursting . No , it 's just the last time we went artifact hunting , I wasn 't being kept alive by one . Not that I 'm not incredibly grateful for the whole not being dead thing , but ... we still don 't know the risks of the metronome . Oh , don 't be such a Debbie downside . Look , we 've got our youth . And a list . You know what ? I call scavenger hunt . I bet I can snag more artifacts on this list than you can , Debbie . If I say no , you 're gonna make me play anyways , aren 't you ? - The challenger has accepted . - Right . Hi , there . Are you here for our summer-sational sale ? Ooh , sale . There 's a sale . Thongs give me a rash . We 're looking for a Jordan Tivoli ? He might be sporting a new pair of sunglasses . Jordan normally works in the stock room . Kind of a weird guy , but I haven 't seen him for hours . - Why ? - Have you noticed anything strange around here recently , perhaps the smell of fudge ? That 's the fudge factory next door--yum . But now that you mention it , things have been falling off shelves a lot today , and earlier I thought I heard someone sneeze , but I was all alone here . Could have been a panic attack , though . I get those a lot . Excuse us . - Uh , what was that ? - I entered those sunglasses - info into the UAD . - The UAD ? Unsnagged Artifact Database . So it says here the sunglasses might have belonged to a John A. Macready . Oh , he was the pilot who first developed Ray-Bans . I guess his first pair worked so well at reflecting light , they made the wearer invisible to the human eye . So you think an invisible Jordan is just hanging around the store . Why would he do that ? And now I see why . There 's a ghost in there ! Who ya gonna call ? Okay , so the next door neighbor said she heard a loud crash about an hour ago but thought it was the meth lab downstairs . Nice neighborhood . Pete , just check out these burns . I mean , they kind of look like lightning strikes . So something that controls lightning . Did Thor smoke a pipe ? So where would a small-time thief go if he suddenly stumbled upon a powerful artifact ? For starters , I 'd use it to get an apartment with a roof . - Oh--laptop . - Ah ! I am gonna check the browser history . - Look at you going all Claudia . - Uh-huh . He was online an hour ago . Ooh . Hey , Mykes . Human anatomy . I hope it has pictures . And , it does . - Pete ? - Yeah . I think we know where he 's going next . I don 't hear any violins . No , but according to the girl 's mother , her lesson only started ten minutes ago , so maybe we 've got time to- - Or not . Much better , Tia . Keep the fingers curved . And , again . Stop playing ! Stop it ! - Hey , she 's just a beginner . - It 's okay . It 's okay , we 're with the department of- - Of contagion . Contagion . Uh , this violin , was it bought at a pawn shop downtown ? My mom bought it this morning . This--this isn 't the avian flu , is it ? Or SARS ? Get--get it out of here ! - It 's okay , your mom sent us . - Yeah . Aren 't you gonna quarantine her ? Uh--er--um , wash your hands . Okay , oh--Napoleon . - It figures . - What ? I 'm fairly certain this is the violin Napoleon played in exile . If that girl would have hit a G-sharp , this town would have erupted in a wave of violence that would have made 13 Vendemiaire seem like a street fair . All right , one down . What 's next ? Uh , Devil 's Lake golf and country club . A Jew and a black woman go to a fancy country club . All we need is a priest and a horse , and we can do the whole joke . Hey , Mykes , he says there 's a guy out front who saw it . Pete , it 's snowing . Why is it snowing in the summer ? It must be a residual effect of the pipe . Kid could make a killing in Palm Springs . Yeah . Oh . Excuse me , sir ? Could you- - could you tell us what happened ? Some kind of rogue tornado . One minute it 's all clear , and the next--it 's snowing . It came out of nowhere . Thank God nobody was killed . It 's snowing . It is . Thank you for--for that . Pete , um , here . Check out this ATM . I mean , that was- - that was Jesse 's target . All right , so- - he can make lightning and tornadoes and snow . For a few thousand bucks , he almost killed a couple folks . Okay , what happened in his apartment , that was an accident . This ? He 's learning how to control it . A bad guy with this kind of power ? Talk about stormy weather . It 's not enough . It 's not near enough . Time to do some serious damage . Oh , Lord , what 's Jesse done now ? Mrs. Ashton , when was the last time you saw your son ? It 's been weeks . What 's happened ? Well , then again , with the Secret Service after him , maybe I don 't want to know . Well , he got his hands on something pretty dangerous , so , anything you could tell us would help . Well , poor boy 's always had a terrible temper . It 's brought him and us no end of trouble , even ever since he was little . He never finished school , couldn 't hold down a job . Always blaming others for his own misfortunes . I suppose there 's just some things in this world you can 't control . Mrs. Ashton , I 'm so sorry . Could I trouble you for , um , a glass of water ? - Let me fix you a cup of tea . - Thank you . Wow , did you just use the old " can I get a glass of water " move ? Well , Pete , sometimes the classics work . How many banks did we pass driving through town ? Eh , I wasn 't counting . I saw three Dairy Queens , though . Look at these bills . Pete , Country Sky was foreclosing on the Ashton house . Jesse could have hit any bank in town , but he chose Country Sky . Yeah , the one his family owes money to . I mean , it makes sense . The kid 's running a one-man occupy Devil 's Lake . But that 's the only branch in town , so- - where does he go next ? Mykes , he--he 's making storms , right ? So maybe we don 't need to predict his next target . Maybe we just need to predict the weather . Oh , are you leaving ? Yes , we have to go . Well , if you find Jesse- - please don 't hurt him . He 's still my son . - Thank you . - Bye . Bye . No sign of the hollow man yet . Well , just keep your eyes open . You do know he 's invisible , right ? Well , then keep your ears open . You know , you 're really not supposed to be watching the dressing room monitors . I mean , it 's corporate policy . Oh , it 's okay . I 'm a federal agent . Also , I 'm gay . Oh , my God . Do you watch Revenge ? - No ... - Steve . Steve , I heard something . Claudia , he 's right behind you . Wha--you can see him ? Yeah , you 're looking right at him . Where , exactly ? - He shows up on camera . - Wha--hey . Whoa . Check this out . Invisible to the naked eye , but not the digital one . Huh . All right . Let 's see . Uh-huh . Aha . I 'm definitely having a panic attack . Cool shades . What 's going on ? I can 't see anything . Just a side effect of your peek-a-boo shades . You 'll be blind for twice as long as you were wearing them . But I had them on for hours . I didn 't hurt anyone . I was just- - Window shopping , we know . Your eyesight will come back , but I 'd say you lost your job for good . You okay ? Hmm ? Oh , yeah . Must just be sore from too much pop physique yesterday . Come on , we 've got more artifact shopping to do . First point to you , poopypants . You know , I prefer Jinksie . Thank you . Yeah , okay , so Hank Conway ... checked in for his tee time , but nobody 's seen him since . Artie , look . Artie ! Golfers don 't usually leave those lying around . BJ . Bobby Jones . Oh , my God . These are the clubs Bobby Jones used in the 1921 British Open . His temper got the better of him , he stormed off the course , but not before throwing these clubs all over the green . Oh , well , we better keep them away from John McEnroe 's tennis racket . Yeah , but why are they just lying here ? Sand wedge- - eh , uh , the 9-iron 's missing . I think Conway 's probably got it . I don 't think so . According to the photo we got off the internet- - Uh-huh . You must be Mr. Conway . Bit of a headache . Okay , so we are up and running . So if the pipe creates storms , it also creates a , uh , - a low-pressure front , right ? - Exactly . And if Jesse 's raising the roof , we 'll be able to track him on weather radar . - That 's really smart , Pete . - Ha ha ! Man , I feel just like Helen Hunt in Twister . Bill Paxton . I mean I feel like Bill Paxton . - Hey , Helen ? - Ugh . You wanna take a look at that ? Oh , look at that . Looks like we got a Jesse front moving in from the northeast . Right , it 's--it 's , uh , centering on the corner of Glenwood and Eagle Crest road . - Okay . Watch this . - What are you doing ? After the beep , please say a command . Uh , destination Glenwood and Eagle Crest . Glenwood and Eagle Crest . - See ? - Oh . Thank you , Clarice . Now , could you whip me up some chocolate chip cookies ? You have arrived at your destination . Help ! Help , he 's crazy ! Let me guess . A rogue tornado came out of nowhere . Yeah . Threw the truck around and knocked me out . Next thing I know , some stupid kid is handcuffing me - to this railing . - Where is he ? In there . He 's wasting his time . It 's an armored truck with a time lock . He 'll never break in . Yeah , keep telling yourself that . Just--you just- - just stay here . Oh , okay . Whoa . Jesse Ashton ? Let us see your hands . Okay , look , kid . You don 't know what you 're holding there . Really ? I think it 's a magic pipe that lets me control the weather . Okay , maybe you do . Hand it over . Jesse , listen , you don 't understand . No , you don 't understand . I 'm running out of time . I need this . Somebody could get hurt , kid . I know . It might even be you . Heads up . Hey , is that a- - that looks like a- - look out , Mykes ! Ow . Oh ... Did he just drop a truck on us ? Yeah . And he 'd better be gone ! Yeah , you 'd better be gone ! Yeah , he 's gone . So--so , what , he- - he drops the armored truck , he--he- - cracks it open , and- - oh , yeah . Takes all the money inside . Yup . It 's the piggy bank principle , but on a bigger scale . Okay . There 's something else going on with him , though . Did you see the bandage on his arm ? I mean , it 's kind of like the ones they use when you get your blood drawn . Right , right . And , uh , but he had that , uh- - the medical book at his house . Right , the book on anatomy . - Blood test . - Money . He said that he was running out of time . Pete , what if Jesse 's sick ? I don 't understand . My wife 's been begging me to take her golfing . Yeah , okay , wh--these clubs . You bought these at the pawn shop downtown ? I wasn 't gonna get her a new set of Callaways . I want her to hate it . Golf is my hobby . It 's my time to hang out with the guys . And somebody 's supposed to stay home and do the cooking and the cleaning ? No , she 's a terrible cook . I wonder why she hit you ? Okay , so where is the 9-iron ? Wha--after she whacked me with it ? - Yeah . - No idea . Okay , as long as she 's got that 9-iron , the slightest annoyance is gonna magnify into a furious rage . My guess is she 's taken a divot out of one of your hang-out buddies . Where would they be right now ? Oh , hey , Janet . Where 's Hank ? We 're gonna miss our tee time . Oh ! Janet , what the hell ? Every single weekend with you idiots , and the Christmas lights are still up ! What do you need ? Hey , Claud , look . Myka needs the- - Psst ! Quietly . Myka needs the 32-bit decryption code thingy - to access the hospital records . - Yeah , got it . Emailing now . Why are we whispering ? 'Cause of the killer birds . Right ... See ya . So sorry . Won 't take a sec . Yeah , no rush . At least now we know what the birdcage does . Okay . The Prius is backed up to the door . On my count , you toss me the cage , we sprint for the neutralizer tank in the trunk . Easy peasy . What about Woodstock and Tweety and all their friends ? He 's got his eyes on my eyes . Yeah . Did you not hear me say " sprint " ? Okay , one--two- - oh , this counts as my point in the scavenger hunt , right ? - Claudia . - Three ! Oh , ah . God , they got me . - Where ? - Ah , right there . - I don 't see anything . - Are you sure ? Yeah , there 's not a scratch . You 're okay . Oh , God , no . This is karma for playing too much Angry Birds . God , I can feel it . Ow . We were supposed to go to the flower show . But no ! " I can 't , dear . I 've gotta spend eight hours getting drunk with my buddies ! " - Janet , please ! - Put that club down ! - No . - Artie , be careful . With that aura she could kill somebody . Oh , I can handle her- - whoa ! Oh , look , there 's Hank . Where ? Oh ! All right , get the neutralizer from my bag . Get the neutralizer now ! Artie , just toss me the club . What ? Just hand it over ? Sure , that 's what everybody wants . I do all the work ! And nobody knows . I 'm the one who risked everything , who was asked to sacrifice Everything that he loves ! And I can 't even tell anyone that I saved them . Unh-ow . Oh , thanks . Eh , some bad juju on that club . Artie , what was that about ? - What was what about ? - What you just said . Said about what ? I don 't , wh--I don 't know . Artie , your anger was stemming from something very- - Nothing . What ? I 'm always angry . That 's my raison d 'etre . Ask anybody . Grumble , grumble . Let 's go ! - Mrs. Ashton . - Did you find Jesse ? No . We , um--we tracked Jesse 's medical records , thinking he had some sort of blood test , but we found out that he 's been making donations to a , um ... Ronald Ashton . For Ronnie . His little brother . And--and that would be Ronnie ? Yes . I knew it . We 'd been getting donations anonymously . They have a rare blood type . Deep down , I knew it . You see , Jesse 's not a bad person . He 's always loved his little brother . Mrs. Ashton , what- - what happened to Ronnie ? Heart infection . Myocarditis . He 's taken a bad turn these past few days . Uh-huh . Is that why Jesse 's robbing banks ? He 's what ? Oh , my God . Jesse 's obviously trying to help , but , um . People are getting hurt . Oh , we 've been drowning in bills , but- - Oh , Jesse , what are you doing ? Paging Dr. Gellar . Dr. Gellar , please report to the OR . Who are you ? What are you doing in my office ? My brother , Ronnie Ashton . The doctors said that he needed surgery . I mean , we can pay for it now , okay ? - Money isn 't the only issue- - - That is bull ! You and the insurance guys and that stupid bank have been bleeding my mom dry since Ronnie got sick . Look , with his condition , we need to find a suitable donor . Even then , there are--there are dozens of other factors- - I-I don 't care about other factors . I can get you all the money you need . Just fix my brother . It 's more complicated than that . Then maybe I need to simplify it for you . Mrs. Ashton , we need to find Jesse . Do you have any idea- - He 's here , Mykes . - What ? - Jesse . He 's in the hospital . Pete , the roof . There 's a storm forming over the roof . Whoo ! Whoo ! Now do you see what I can do ? Ah ! You shoot lightning too ? That 's our thing ! Why won 't you two leave me alone ? Jesse , listen to me . We know why you 're doing this . Okay , we know about your brother ! Then make them do it ! I can pay for it . Ronnie cannot die . Yeah , but other people will if you don 't give us that pipe ! No . No ! I 'm in control now , for once . Screw other people . You tell them that they got one hour to start fixing Ronnie , or I turn this hospital into a pile of rocks . No ! - Aah ! - Uhh ! Look , you need to get everyone into the basement , all right ? I can 't fit an entire hospital full of patients into the basement . Can 't you stop him ? Look , I 'm not a big fan of " give the terrorist what he wants , " but wouldn 't it be easier to just give his brother the surgery ? I tried to tell him . Ronnie 's myocarditis is too advanced . He needs a heart transplant . All right , so just pop a new ticker into the kid . - They do it every day . - Pete , finding a compatible donor heart is very difficult and specific . No , I know , I- - We thought we had one last week , but the organ wasn 't viable . We 're still looking , but the odds of finding a compatible heart in the time that Ronnie has now are- - Oh ! Are not good . I get it . I 'll talk to security about evacuation . - Hey . - Hey . Hey . There is a storm on the roof . What did we miss ? Yeah , well , Jesse 's up there , and if the hospital doesn 't give his brother a heart transplant in the next hour , he 's gonna level the place . So we missed a lot . We have to get up there and stop him . The trouble is , we just tried that , and he just blew us off . Eh , I don 't mean he was being rude . I mean he literally blew us off the roof . There 's gotta be some way to get the drop on him . Actually , it 's a little not by the manual , and Artie would be pissed , but--we may have a solution . Jesse ! Look , I 'm unarmed . Okay , I-I don 't want to hurt you , I just- - I just want to talk . Have they started surgery yet ? They will . Okay , they 're looking as hard as they can for--for a- - Ah ! That 's close enough . Jesse , they need more time . No ! You 've seen him ! He 's out of time . Look , what about everyone else ? Okay , what about the other patients downstairs ? I don 't care . He 's my little brother . I don 't understand- - I got the money . Why won 't they help him ? Now you see me ... Now , you don 't . Listen , Ronnie 's a good kid , okay ? He never did anything wrong . He 's--he 's smart , he 's funny , he 's got a future , okay ? And I 'm not gonna let some crappy , greedy hospital take that from him . Who 's there ? You can see me , can 't you ? Get away from me . Pete ! I 'm getting the feeling we 're near the edge here , right ? It 's over , Jesse . Don 't make me shoot you . Why won 't they help him ? They don 't have a compatible heart . The donor needs to be a perfect match . We 're sorry , man . Okay , just- - there 's nothing anyone can do . Okay . I understand . Tell Ronnie- - I 'm sorry . I wish I was a better brother . I wasn 't ever there for him . Now I can be . Jesse , no ! Jesse , wait ! What is it ? Mykes ! Mykes , Mykes , what happened ? - Pete . Pete . - Myka ! He 's--he 's dead . Is it over ? Yeah . Mrs. Garner- - Jesse 's a compatible donor , right ? I mean , he 's a match for his brother Ronnie ? Get a gurney . And page Dr. Gellar . I 'll notify the OR . To get ready for an organ transplant . We couldn 't save him , Pete . He got what he wanted , Mykes . He saved his brother after all . Ow , ow , ow , ow . Ow ! You 're such a wimp . Well , you know , it hurts . Ooh . Naughty . Hey , uh , that nurse was hot , right ? - Still having vision issues ? - A little blurry . She was totally your type . I 'll give her your number . Shwing . So , how 's Ronnie ? Well , he 's still in surgery , but the heart 's a perfect match , so they think it 'll work . I just can 't stop thinking about what--what Jesse did . You know , giving his brother a second chance like that . Yeah , the things we do for family , huh ? Yeah . Well , now we can finally dot the " I " s on the end of Walter Sykes . Thank God . Oh , and hey- - let 's never mention Dr. Evil 's name again , shall we ? Deal ! Where 's Artie and Leena ? Already on their way back to the Warehouse with the booty . - Well , who 's hungry ? - You are . At all times . Oh , there 's this great diner in town . We snagged Maurice Vermersch 's waffle iron there earlier today . Makes the greatest waffles in the world . Ooh , what 's the downside ? You can 't have just one . No , actually it makes your skin melt . Ooh , well , Pete love waffles . Oh , Myka . Can you tell me something ? - Do I have a scratch on my neck ? - Where ? Right there . I don 't see anything . You 're fine . Yeah , really ? That is so weird . Ow ! God , what now ? Okay . I put the clubs next to Buddy Rich 's drums . The two energies should cancel each other out . As long as Pete can 't find them the next time he decides to build a putt-putt course in the ovoid quarantine . Uh , Artie , about what you said when you were under the influence of the club- - Oh , yeah , I told you , it was nothing . It was just the idle rantings of a crazy old Warehouse agent . I 've known you a long time , Arthur Nielsen . And ever since Sykes 's attack , I 've been seeing- - something different . And you don 't have to tell me , okay , but whatever burden you 're carrying , please ... Don 't carry it alone . Hello . Yes , it 's Arthur . Yes , I 'm at the Warehouse . Where else would I be ? Uh , listen . There 's something that I need ... done , and for various reasons I can 't tell Pete or Myka . Or anybody . Not yet . Something I need done completely off the books . Not a word . Hmm ? Um , no one . Uh , yes , good . All right , good , I 'll send you the information . Yeah . Well , it 's , uh- - I want you to find ... a certain artifact before it finds me .

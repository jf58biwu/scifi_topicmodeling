Can you help me ? - You have one enough ! So ... Jonie is dying . I wish we could get her to a hospital or ... anywhere we could pump her stomach and give her medicine . I might be able to help her , but here , there is nothing I can do . When I was a little girl , I had a horse named Pumpkin . And he fell and broke his leg . And they said he probably didn 't have a chance . Probably . Its the probably that kills you though , you know ? I didn 't want to do it . I didn 't know want to do it now . Ah , I can 't think about this . They can probably do it better than I could . I hate to say it , but I need them . There is something else I can do . There has to be something else we can do . Listen there is nothing else we can do . - Please ... - She 's going to die . So what are we supposed to do then ? It 's going to get more and more people , I think I think we have to end it . To kill her ? Okay . How do we kill her ? - I don 't know . - I won 't shoot her . - Okay . - I won 't do it . Maybe ... what if we snapped her neck ? It would be quick , right ? You don 't feel that pain , right ? Tell me she won 't feel that pain . Okay . Alright . I 'll do this . I will do this . I will do this it 's okay . I don 't know how I can 't do this .

After she see just watched someone get their neck snapped ? It was your fault . It was no ones fault . Fuck you ! My fault ? You would have done the same thing . How the hell was I supposed know it was pitch black in here ? - Your stupid man . - Why don 't you start worrying about what the fuck we need to do ? Huh ? - Why don 't you think about that shit ! - Hey ! Stop it ! Both of you ! It 's not making anything better . Do you understand ? We need to get out of here . Your not thinking straight . And that 's all good but you need to listen . - We 're gonna listen to your plan ? - Yeah ... Is that what we 're supposed to do ? And your plan is what ? To go in attack mode ? - Three against a hundred ? - Yeah ... no ! - With our one machine gun ? - Some kind of action ! Better than being couped up ! What ? Not to going some place with more weapons and people ? So we can fight back as a group ? - No ! Your the Lone Ranger I forgot ! - Stop fighting ! Please !

About 5 more minutes , I know I can start it this time . - We shouldn 't be out in the open . - Dude , it 's the only way out of here . We can 't be seen up here on this roof this entire time . Alright is this everything ? - Yeah , I think so . - I got the gun and the food . And the food . Grab the its not water . So we don 't suffer from anything . What else do we need ? Any extra food in the back ? Hear that ? - What ? - What ? That ! What is that ? Oh my god . Hey , look up there . I don 't think that 's good . That is some nasty shit . - Look at those people . - We need to get inside . Get inside ! Go ! Grab everything ... lets go ! - Get the lights ... find it faster . - I can 't fucking find it any faster ! I need the extra towels from the store . Unwrap that stuff , we don 't need any of that shit getting in here . - Here ! Here ! - Thank you . Your a little bit out of control . I think there is little bit of that in my lungs now . Hear that ? Great ! Your paranoid . No . No . We should have fucking left two hours ago . I knew it ! - Well , we didn 't . - Why don 't you ever fucking listen to me ? You want to get into that ? We are sitting in a fucking bathroom with no place to go ! Why would I listen to you anyway with all your stupid ideas ? Stupid ? Your stupid idea was to fucking stay here ! Now look at us we 're in a fucking bathroom ! If we had left , we would be dead already ! We would be in this state if we had left two hours ago ! Fuck ! Do you guys ever get along ? It 's not gonna matter anyway . Why don 't you turn off the fucking lights to save our fucking batteries ? Yeah , right . Why don 't you say fuck a couple of more times ? - I don 't do well in small spaces . - You should calm down ... plenty of food and water and everyone 's fine . Plenty of food and water ? All we have is 3 bottles of fucking water and a couple bags of chips . Yeah , we 're gonna be fucking great . The Department of Defense instructs for everyone to stay indoors . Tape up your doors and window sills . If you have a gas mask ... we urge you to use it . If you don 't have one use a towel to cover up your mouth and nose . The black smoke has only has a life for a few hours . No . We 're going to do Countries , starting with the letter A. Roger . Afghanistan . - Right ? A country . - That works . Libya Cuba Denmark Um . England . Yeah , I need help . France ... Jesus it 's hot . Germany - Haiti - Yoy know what ? What is that sound right now ? Hey ! Are you kidding ? Are you fucking eating ? Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! What are you doing ? We got the same supply here . This isn 't part of our supply . This is my food from earlier . There wasn 't any food from earlier when we came in here . It 's to be equal share for everybody , Roger ! - This isn 't part of our share . - This is my food from earlier ! The bag was already open ! But we agreed we have so little and whatever we have is cut evenly . I don 't believe that 's what we did at all . I said these bags right here are what we all split . This , is what I found in my own pocket . This is why you 're not in a relationship , because your fucking selfish . Right here ... learn something about yourself . Yeah , did I hit a little too close to home ? You hide food in here and don 't tell us about it , we 're supposed to eat at the same time and divide it evenly . - Hold on a second . - What ? If I had a breath mint , would you want me to break that into three too ? Yes I do ! That is the stupidest fucking thing ... How about the water ? Did you drink the water too ? No ! Did I drink the water too ? No ! It wasn 't in my pocket from earlier ! Why don 't you just bathe in it ? I don 't give a shit ! Something stinks in here ! - Dude , you got your shoes off ! - It 's probably you . Wow ! You guys are unbelievable . You know what ? I 'm gonna go see how things are outside since things in here can 't get any worse . I don 't think you should go outside . Well ... I would rather be out there than in here . So , do you think while I 'm gone , while I 'm gone , can you guys resolve whatever this is , so from now on we can move on and stop fighting . Because this is not getting us anywhere . And frankly , I 'm tired of listening to it . Grow up ! You shouldn 't go . It hasn 't been two hours yet . How long has it been ? Do we have any idea how long its been ? I gotta pee . - Well , can 't you hold it ? - No . Give me a second until I find some place . Hurry . I need help ! What ? Toilet paper ? Sorry kid , I 'm fresh out . Well find something . Ah , Jesus ... No . - It 's a receipt ! - Exactly ! - No ! - Hey ! At least it 's not used . Whatever . Beggars can 't be choosers kid . - Want it back ? - No ! It 's all yours ! Well ... I guess it now or never , right ? I wonder if their gonna nuke the City ? They will not nuke the City . Trust me . Holy shit ! I fucking knew it ! Look , I told you ! Didn 't I ? I called it ! I knew it ! You can have all the credit Roger ! What if they do this to all the Cities ? No , No , no ... one or two Cities would be a good deterrent , if they do anymore than that then we 'll have to start from the beginning and be like cavemen . Well , maybe we 'll have to and that is the only way we can get ride of these things . Holy shit ! Look at that ! Look at That ! 2 million people still living over there , oh great their gone , now we can write them off . Where the hell is the Military ? I mean , shouldn 't they be here , shouldn 't they be fighting ? Is there anyone doing anything , We 've barely seen any Military presence , they probably hit them first , that was their strategy . So it was like their plan . It had to be their plan . Look if we get to Paradise City , it 's a Military town , we can get guns , ammunition , we can start doing something right now ! - Whatever is left of the town . - You think there is anyone left ? Paradise City and Little Haven are both cleared as radiation free zones . On this side of Paradise City has been bombarded with dozens more sunders . The invaders have constructed a base camp that is suspected . I think it 's the alternator , I can 't ... Hey ... - Hey ! - Hey ! Hey ! I still can 't believe that my home is gone . You never think that something like is going to happen to you . But at least the planes are back . Maybe they are going to where the Military is . Hopefully , that place is where we 're going too . What are you thinking ? They are all going the same way . I tell you what ... there are going to people banding together , we 'll see who 's left . Alright ? If I had a guess , I would say it 's probably what 2OO , OOO of them and there are 2 billion people assuming , so that is 2O , OOO to every one invader . Those are our odds . - That is pretty good . - Thanks ! That 's assuming that there are that many people left . Hey ... you finally got this piece of crap running . Couple tried to get it ... good to see you . - Yeah , happy to see you too . - Wait you guys know each other ? - We met earlier . - Do you have any food ? We 've got some chips in the car . I 'll get you some alright ? Good to see your still walking around . You know it . Paradise City ? - Yeah . - Yeah ? Got room for two ? - Yeah we do . Lets go . - Alright , Hang on , gotta grab my gun ! Yeah , first thing we 're gonna do is get a hot meal and some fresh and a shower . What the hell is that ? I don 't know . No don 't touch it . It 's got thorns ... I 've never seen anything like this around here . Hey ! Come check this out ! Maybe its from one of those tripod things . That 's black smoke coming down , maybe it was seeding or something . I saw this movie once where the human race had to escape Earth and they ended up on another Planet and in order to survive on that Planet they had to adapt to their environment . So they started to planting things , so they could live there . I think that 's what they are doing here . - It 's called terraforming . - Yes , terraformer . To make it inhabitable , changing the biological systems . Yeah . We need to know what 's down there . Someone to scout it out ? I 'll do it . Go down there , listen , watch , observe them , figure out what their doing , what their weaknesses are . Maybe get some supplies . - You can 't go down there by yourself . - I can get down there . I 'll go down there . - No one of us ... No , I 'll go . - We should all go . Why just by yourself ? Because I 'm faster and I can take care of myself and worrying about to other people is just gonna slow it down . And there is more of a chance for us to get caught . You stay here , you take care of her . I 'll be back . I guarantee it . Well , I don 't like it either way man . It will be good . I will . Be safe . How you doing ? Hm , good . - Cold . Tired . - Yeah right . Cold I know , I know . I 'm cold . You know your funny . Huh ? I think if this hadn 't happened , you know you and me , wouldn 't have happened either ? Right ? In the real world ? The normal world at the bar , when things were . I don 't know , maybe you 're different . Your different too , crazy ... not different . You may be right , this would not have happened . Now everything is different , everything is changing . Hey you okay ? Water ... water , I need water . What happened ? The invaders have all these people in this fenced area and their just - sucking all their blood out ! - How many are down there ? Thousands ! Thousands and thousands ! Any Military ? Any aggressive presence ? - Any good sign at all ? - There is no hope ! We lost ! We 're done ! It 's over ! Goodbye ! There is nobody else ! This war is over ! Guys come here . Come in here . I 've got something in mind , there is a move we can make . I hope its better than your last plan . We have a plan , and bombs . And anders has been teaching me how to make bombs . That 's very strange . It 's actually very interesting and we have a little arsenal going , which is cool . I guess you could say that I am a terrorists . Maybe that is not such a bad thing always ? I kind a like it . I am waiting for the tripod , the others are setting up the bombs at the car . And I volunteered to be the bait . I ran a little track in high school , hopefully , I can still run fast enough to get away from this thing . And hopefully , our bombs work . Anders made them , I don 't know how he knows so much about bombs . He said it was from the Military information they sent out when the whole thing started , but ... it 's almost like he knew before that . I don 't know who this guy is , but if he saves us all , I guess ... who cares ? Anyway , I don 't know why we are doing this . The Military , we keep asking . I keep asking ... It 's coming . It 's too close . God , I can 't do this . This is never gonna work , it 's too close . This is crazy . I was there , I was gonna do it . I don 't know , I was just ... I 'm Never gonna get away from that thing . It 's too fast . I 'm not that good of a runner . We don 't even know if those things are gonna go off . We need a better plan . I can do this , I know I can do this . It 's time . Here goes nothing . You 've got to apply some pressure to the middle switch , that is the trigger . This is not gonna work . It 's gonna work . - Anything it 's not gonna work ! - That was one grenade . You gotta have faith . Yes , that is the trigger . Right , pump it up . It better fucking work ! Oh my god ! Oh my god ! Oh my god ! Come on guys ! These sons of bitches ! I told you ! I knew it was going to work ! Good job ! Yeah baby ! Yeah ! Fuck you , yeah ! We got you ! - We got you ! - Guys , hold on a second . There is something in the distance ! Guys ! Guys ! We gotta get out of here ! Run baby run ! Run ! Wait ! Wait ... They could die ! We need to help them ! So we have guards everywhere and a fence that goes all the way around , this looks like it 's not going to be real easy . There are ways through the fence . Big enough for a person ? Yeah , big enough for sure . I 'll show you . Are they safe ? The guards too I don 't see it being a problem . There are flyers that are going above the line . It 's looks like they are on a random system , but they are not . Look , see the first one going by ? - Right there ? - Yeah . It 's going to our advantage right now . The second one that goes by , start counting after that , there is a break in between . We can time it so there is not any activity , we can get through there . It 's almost time to go . I just don 't want to forget something . Um ... this is going to sound crazy , but . When I was standing to face face with that thing . It looked at me . And it 's like I heard a voice , like not a voice . More like a feeling . And it looked at me like a person would look at a cow or something . Just as food , but ... not angry more I like thought , more like regret almost and shame . It 's not what I expected . It 's lonely without the others and I 'm really scared for them . The United States Government is urging every citizen to protect themselves . Every man , woman and child is now responsible for their own safety . If you have a firearm , you need to use it . - Our Military has ... - We almost set ? Yeah . What do we have left on that one ? Looks good , but not much for this other one . - Yeah . - Yeah . Never enough is it ? And these things , are they actually gonna work ? They better . Jesus , it dark out here without the lights . What is that ? Looks like an oil refinery . It 's not pretty , - I don 't like it . - Is there gonna be anything left ? We have to think positive . Under the circumstances , we 'll have to see won 't we ? I guess so . You got this ? I used to like driving at night . When you were younger ? - Yeah . - Me too . Anders should be back any second . He said this would only take 2O minutes but he 's been gone a lot longer . - I 'm hopes he didn 't ... - What the hell are you doing here ? My god ... I 'm waiting for a friend . What company are you with ? This is Bravo company 's territory . I 'm not with a company ! We heard the emergency broadcast , we brought some bombs . Then we better go get them . Because its gonna go ... No ! I have people down there ! You can 't blow it yet ! What are you doing with that ? I 'm just filming some stuff , you know , I thought it might come in handy later . For my family and stuff . You okay ? Look , my friend Anders is down there . He needs to know what is going on . Let 's go . Just wait here , I 'm gonna go check things out . Oh shit ! This is a really bad idea ! I should have just waited for Anders . God , those things just scoop you up and that 's it . This isn 't gonna work . Hey ! Thanks god your back ! Come on ! See him ? No . - No Roger . - Me either . Okay , lets keep going there is more up ahead . Come on . - Roger ! - Roger ! Don 't touch the fence , its all electric over here . Fuck it 's good to see you ! - How you doing ? How you doing man ? - I 'm doing good man . - What 's up brother ? - Are you okay ? Are you hurt ? Okay sweetie , we 're gonna get you out of here . We don 't have time for this , we gotta blow the fence . There is a whole bunch of weapons right over there . - Right over where ? - Right over there . / We got it . Everyone back away from the fence , we 're gonna blow it ! Come on ! We gotta go ! Come on ! Okay listen ... where is Sera ? They take everybody to that black temple right over there . - Right over there ? - No , honey , you have to stay . What is your name ? I 'm Rennick . - I 'm Anders . - It 's not safe there ! - Tell her we she has to stay ! - We 'll come back for you ! Let 's go ! - This is Tiffany . - You got her ? I got her . I want to come ! I know ! But you can 't ! You 've got to stay ! This is Rennick . He 's going to take care of you ! All right ! You got to stay with him . What is this place ? I 've no idea . - It fucking reeked in here . - Yeah it does . Do we know what we 're doing in here ? What the fuck was that ! ? It 's my handy work , it 's mine . - Your handy work ? - Done . How did the fuck did you learn how to make a bomb with timer ? Reading books ? - You ? Read ? Bullshit . - Guys ... Hey there is something up there . Catch the light . Anders , seriously I know Dr. Suess does not teach you how to make a bomb with a timer . You son of a bitch ! Let go ! Heads ! You son of a bitch ! Let go ! Jesus ... I don 't know what I was expecting , but definitely , this is not it . Come on Roger , I 've seen what you brought home when your drunk . So I guess this is where I 'm supposed to ask you where your from and what you want . But honestly , I don 't care . Come on guys , let 's kill this bitch ! Yeah , come on , get her out of here . Come on ! Get up ! Get up ! We gotta get out of here ! - Does this belong to you ? - Yeah she does . Don 't fucking leave me again ! - Damn ... - Good job by the way . Hey thanks . Just getting started . I 'm going to get these people out of the cages . - Keep your heads down ! ... Y ou too ! - Good luck ! - How are you doing ? You making it ? - Fucking yeah . - You want get down ? - Put me down . This is by no means an admission to inferiority . So where do we go from here ? Well , we could keep running and hiding or we can find another nest of those brain blobs and fry the living daylights out of them . Shit ! I think I used too many explosives . No , where . It 's never enough . Come on . Let 's move . The United States Government is urging every Citizen to protect themselves . Every man , woman and child is responsible for their safety . If you have a firearm , you need to use it . We did it . We won . But it doesn 't really feel like a victory , Just feels like a starting point . Cause we still have to fight . We have to fight until we kill every one of these fucking creatures and take back what is ours . Because I refuse to run , and I refuse to be scared and I refuse to hide for the rest of my life waiting for something to come around a corner ! Well that 's not going to happen anymore ! I won 't do it . So they can leave or they can die . Because we are the resistance . And that 's all there is .

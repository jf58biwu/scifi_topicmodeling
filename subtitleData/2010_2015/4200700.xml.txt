 Captions synched to : Green.Lantern.TS.XViD.IMAGiNE Lovingly cooked by Bakemstr . Billions of years ago , a race of immortals harness the most powerful force in existence . The Emerald energy of will power . These immortals the Guardians of the Universe , built a world from where they could watch over all of existence . The Planet Oa . They divided the universe into 3,600 sectors . A ring powered by the energy of will , was sent to every sector to select a recruit . In order to be chosen by the ring , it was said " One must be without fear " . Together these 3,600 recruits formed the intergalactic peace keepers , known as The Green Lantern Corp. Green Lantern Of all the threats the Corp ever faced , the gravest was an entity of fear known as , Parallax . Only the legendary Green Lantern , Abin Sur , was capable of capturing and imprisoning this beast . Which he did , on the lost planet of Rayut . Planet Rayut : Lost sector . Explorer 6 to Base - our ship has crashed somewhere northeast of the lost sector . Please send help , immediately . You are afraid . Good . Six months later . Sector 2814 . Sinestro , I 'm traveling at maximum velocity . - Tell Ventara that I .. - Ventara is dead . The planets inhabitants ? Your mission to evacuate them is no longer necessary . ... it 's just as it was in Taluk . Every life form destroyed , and their essence absorbed . Traces of yellow power everywhere . - And the guardians ? - The Guardians are silent . I 've demanded an audience ... Where is , Suuuurrrr ? I 'm badly wounded . Heading to the nearest inhabited planet for the selection process . Tell the Guardians it 's Parallax . No ... . NO ! Sorry , I gotta run , make yourself home , okay . There 's uh , water in the tap . Asshole . The Ferris Saber 3 , is state of the art , ... of artificial intelligent fighter planes . It has all of the flying and combat capability of a human pilot . But with none of the human error that comes with it . Carl isn 't just blowing smoke to get a contract , gentlemen . Your staff , his contractors my office we 've all been part of this . From the ground up . Well I appreciate that , senator . But today , the rubber meets the road . With a simulated combat situation . Two sabers , against Carl 's two best pilots . Hey Carol , I was going to make it a no fly day , what do you think ? - I think you 're late . - Yes , but that 's only because I slept in . I used to sleep in , then I turned eleven . Let me give you a little heads up . I 've gone against these sabers all week and they have smoked me every time . There isn 't anything you can do that they can 't do better . faster , and without disappointing women every where . I uh , think we both know , that 's not true . This is exactly why I didn 't want you for this . My father did . I would have gone with , Jensen . I 'd had gone with Jensen too , but unfortunately he 's busy . - Not being good enough . - At least he shows up . Hal . This test today , it 's important . I got it , I am going to make you look good up there . Don 't worry , Okay . Now let 's get these pants off , and fly some planes . - High Ball , weather checking now . - Roger that . - Good morning , Mr. Ferris . - Good morning everybody . Gentlemen . - We about ready , Tom ? - Yes , Mr. Ferris . We are go to test . Sapphire , cleared weapons hot to converge . Ferris test , Sapphire weapons are off . Are you safe , High Ball ? Uh ... no . God damn it , Tom . What the hell are you feed those things ? F-35 's , what else ? Wakey , wakey Sapphire . If you got a clean shot . Now would be a great time to take it . Easy High Ball , just lining it up . There 's no way we 're taking these out solo , Sapphire . They 're only going to break us up now . On my way , High Ball . Now stay right there . And look real pretty . High Ball , did you just use your wing man as a decoy ? High Ball , those Sabor 's headed up your six , can fly anywhere you can . Well let 's go somewhere I can 't fly . - What the hell is he up to ? - ( Unintelligible ) High Ball , rules of engagement set ceiling at 50,000 feet . Yeah , that 's because the Sabers can stall if they go any higher , right Tom ? And so will you . Compressor stall , compressor stall . YES ! Sorry . Sorry , I mean damn it , Hal . Your boy certainly takes his job seriously . Aileron 's Hal , side to side . I got it . Hal . Keep it warm for me . 40 to 25,000 . You okay there , High Ball ? Yes , just taking a victory lap . - Going to 20,000 . - Okay , High Ball give me some rope . Yeah Dad ! How do you read me ? High Ball you 're approaching minimum eject amount . High Ball you 're below 10,000 ADL . Reflame is unrecoverable , EJECT , EJECT , EJECT ! You 're not scared , are you dad ? Let 's just say , it 's my job not to be . DAD ! Dad ! No ! You stupid son of a bitch . Calm down Bob , it doesn 't matter now . It does matter . Never mind that you crashed a brand new F-35 . You broke the rules of engagement . You sacrificed your wingman . And you blew the contract that this company and half the state was depending on . I 'm sorry , I thought this was a dog fight . I was under the impression the objective was to win . The objective was to show what the Sabers could do in actual combat . And in combat no pilot is going to crater his own plane . I did . Now you know you got to boost the ceiling on your robots . I also showed you what they can 't do . You didn 't have to have to make that point , for the Commander of Accusations . Enough , Carol . Since I 'm going to have to lay off most of my company , anyway . You 're fired . - It 's to late Carl , I quit - You don 't get off that easy . He 's not fired , and you don 't quit . You 're grounded . Pending the results of an investigation . - Watch you 're back . - That 's impossible , Bob . Want to tell me what happened up there ? - The controls locked up . - Don 't give me that , Hal . You had a window when you could have recovered . Did you choke ? Wouldn 't be the first pilot for it happened to . My controls locked up , what the hell is all this anyway , huh ? What 's with the ridiculous suit ? I know that you 're guys have been bugging ... ( Talking over each other ) You 're a pilot , Carol . And a good one . You having to fly a goddamn desk is bullshit . Hal , I like the business part , and I 'm good at it . Which by the way doesn 't meant I 'll never get in a cock pit again . And it isn 't one way or the other . That 's the way a child looks at things . We 're not children anymore . Least ... I just don 't want see someone I care about getting hurt . Least of all , you . Choose a will . A test pilots daring maneuvers almost ended in tragedy . Witnesses say that pilot Hal Jordan ejected at the last possible second . When his jet crashed in an open dessert . He 's the son of the late , Martin Jordon who was killed in his own ill fated test flight back in 1993 . And we are told that Hal Jordon is doing fine right now . Though we have yet to hear an official statement from Ferris air . Hey , guys . Hey . - How was work ? - Aw , it was amazing , Jack . Thank you for asking . Hey , Janice . Just keep to what 's going on here . 'cause I 'm really trying to understand this . Do you want to be like him so bad you want to die like him . - ( Unintelligible ) - Is that it ? I talked to Carl , Hal . - You pushed that plane far past it 's limits . - That 's my job . It was an accident , everybody walked away . Like your motorcycle accident ? The one that put you in the hospital for a month . You know I miss all this quality family time . Good talk , Jack . Jack , come on . - You okay ? - Where 's Jason ? - In his room . - Why ? Hey , it 's Uncle Hal . What 's up there , Ace ? This is the worst 11th birthday party I 've ever been too . No dancing girls ? Hey ! Hey . - I 'm fine . - I guess I got a little freaked out , or something . It happens . Not to you . Look , I told you that you don 't have anything to worry about . You want to know why ? I may be a total screw up . In every other part of my life . But the one thing I do know how to do . Is fly . Hey , got you something , birthday boy . Wrapped it myself . Cool , It 's an X-1 right ? Star fighter . My dad gave me that . Let 's put it up . What happened today ? I mean when you crashed . Not really sure , exactly . Were you scared ? It 's my job not to be . You ain 't totally missing your superman birthday party . Beat it , go ! Go , go , go , go , go , go , go ! I 'm glad you 're okay . Me too , Ace . Stay with me . Stay with me . I can get you some help . You 'll be okay , you 're going to be okay . - Your name ? Your name ? - It 's Hal . - Hal Jordan . - Hal Jordan . I am , Abin Sur . Protector of sector three ... Hey , hey , hey . Listen , I 'm going to bring you to a hospital , okay . Okay , then your garish purple blood . The ring , it chose you . Take it . Place the ring , in the lantern . Place the ring , speak the oath . - What ? But I don 't understand . - Great honor , responsibility . Hey , hey breathe . You got to breathe okay ? All you got to do is breathe , just , just push . Hey , no , no , no . Hey ... hey ! Hey , hey , hey . Come on man , don 't do that . Hey , now don 't , don 't do that . Aw , come on . Yo . Come again ? Hmm . - A space ship . - Yeah . - It 's real ? - It 's real . Okay . - See what kind of power system it has . - Tom - Let 's see what , we can learn from this . - We can 't stay . - We can 't stay here . We gotta go . - What ? Pilot . He wore a uniform . I think he was a soldier . He gave me this . He proposed ? Look out , come on , let 's go . They 're going to know someone was out there . I mean alien pilot 's don 't just bury themselves . I couldn 't just leave him there . I hope this thing isn 't radioactive . I had no idea you 're a genius . - NO ! - Oh , Jesus ! Got it . He said , that the ring chose me . He said it was a great honor . A responsibility . - Responsibility ? - Yeah . You ? Maybe on their planet responsibility just means asshole . Let 's hope so . A great light has gone out in the Universe . Abin Sur is dead . Four of my Lantern brothers killed . And evidence of two worlds annihilated by an unknown enemy . An enemy that possesses the yellow power of fear . We know it originated somewhere in the lost sector . We know it grows more powerful with each encounter . According to Abin Sur 's lost transmission , he seemed to know what he was . His only words were , " It 's Parallax " . We are aware of the threat . We are assessing the situation . While you assess innocent lives will be lost . Let me take the fight to this new enemy . There is much of which you are not aware , Sinestro . If the danger is as great as we suspect ? What are you saying ? You believe this enemy can defeat us ? Guardians , if your faith in our power has faulted let me renew it . Let me take a squadron of my strongest Lanterns , ... against this enemy and I 'll prove to you . Our best days are not behind us . Doctor Hammond ? Doctor Hector Hammond ? We need to ask you to come with us . Did Adam put you up to this ? Get out of the car , please . Doctor Hammond . Amanda Waller . I must apologize for the theatrics . But the government does like its protocols . Please , follow me . Is that what I think it is ? An alien life form , Doctor . The first that mankind has ever encountered . Despite what the conspiracy theorist would have you believe . We want you to do the initial assessment of it 's physiology . My , God . - Why me ? - As a Zeno biologist , ... your skills are specifically suited to the task . Beyond that ? I 'm not at liberty to tell you . Hello ... ooo The eyes , nose , ears , mouth are humanoid . In the left anterior thoracic region is at ten centimeter one , Which acedacis , contains a tacs cyanotic colored coagulant Okay , all right . Place the ring and speak the oath . The oath . ' Cause everybody knows the oath . Least they say they can . I , Hal Jordan . Do solemnly swear , To ... Pledge allegiance to a Lantern . That I got from a dying purple alien . In a swamp . The epidermis is Magenta , it appears transparent , and is extremely thin . Allowing visualization of muscles and individual muscle fibers . To infinity , and beyond . By the power of Grey Skull ! What the hell ? ! Come on , if you can fly me a hundred miles , in the middle of no where , you 'd think you 'd ... Brightest day , and blackest night . No evil shall escape my sight . Let those who worship evils might . Beware my power , Green Lantern 's Light . - Carol . - Everything okay in there ? Fine . - Well can I come in ? - No . Yeah , uh no . ' Cause we 're uh , do you want to get a drink ? - Can we talk ? - Yeah , we can talk . And drink . - My initial analysis . - Thank you , Doctor . I don 't need to tell you that the mere fact that it 's humanoid is extraordinary . It 's indicating a convergent evolution . Or perhaps a common ancestry . And the implications of that , are staggering I mean ... . Where did it come from ? This could completely change the way that the world views itself . Can you imaging the way the public will react to this ? Um , but I know that , that won 't happen , I do . Like yourself , Doctor . I 'm a seeker of truth . But the people who pay for facilities like this . Have other priorities and the power to enforce them . Yes , I 'll keep this secret . People like us have to work within the system , Doctor . We do the best that we can . Right . I , am ... . really sorry . Did you just apologize ? You haven 't been replaced by an alien or something ? No . I 'm good . Ah , I 'm good . I 'm good , totally good , I am ... Do you think I 'm irresponsible ? Don 't need to answer that , that 's fine . Hal . You look pretty . We , we haven 't been in this place , together since ... That night . You forgot it was my birthday . - Did I ? - Mmm . That was also the night , the first time that we ever flew together . Well you 've been flying ever since , so don 't ever let anyone get in the plane . * * The Fleetwoods . Come softly to me , playing in background * * Ohhh , yeah . - No . - Come on now . - No . - Oh yeah , let 's go . - Dance with me . - No . - Dooby do , dahm dahm , dahm do dahm ooby do - No . - Dahm dahm , dahm do dahm , ooby do - No . - Dahm , dahm - Hal . - No ! - Dahm do dahm , ooby do - Dahm , dahm - No . * * - Mm dooby do - Come softly , darling , ... * * * * Come softly , darling . * * I really am sorry . It .. it 's okay . My contract isn 't quite dead yet . - I told you I was going to ... - I wasn 't talking about the contract . How I screwed this up . You know . Even if I didn 't go into the air force I ... I would have found some way to ... You and me were involved . So you tell yourself . What do you tell yourself ? That you were scared of us getting to close . You know what I spent my afternoon doing ? What ? Worrying about you . Hal , I went over ever inch of the flight data , there was nothing wrong with the plane . - What happened up there ? - Thanks for the dance . I told you to watch your back , Jordan . You cost us all our jobs , you son of a bitch . Pathetic . The bastards been living off his old man 's reputation his whole life . Hey . HEY ! My face is just getting warmed up . Whoa . Have you concluded admiring yourself ? Uh , yeah . Well , your ring translator is functioning properly . Your mask will appear when protection of your identity is required . There is no need for it on , Oa . You 're a talking fish . Actually my race is Xudarian , our dealy does somewhat resemble your own Ichthyology species . I am Tomar-Re , Protector of sector 2813 and home to 80,012 galaxies , 2.34 million sentient species . How do I know that ? The induction process , it activates the ring 's higher functions . Including working knowledge space . In truth we were curious , the process has never , been attempted on a species as young as humans before . Because you 're the first to be chosen , I 've been sent to work with you here . And here ... is ? Welcome to Oa . This planet has been our home for countless millennia . It was created for us by the guardians . Guardians ? There stands their citadel . They are immortals among the most ancient races . They made all you see , and are responsible for all we are and do . Since time immemorial , the Green Lantern Corp served as the keepers of peace , order and justice throughout the universe . To be chosen to join it 's ranks , is the highest of honors . And the greatest of responsibilities . Yeah , that part I heard about . We 're going to fly now . - Fly ? - Absolutely . All right , I can do that . Join me . I can do that . Yeah ! What is that ? It 's the energy that 's generated from the central battery . It 's power comes from the will of every living creature in the universe . It in turn charges your lantern which in turn , charges your ring . Even your suit is comprised entirely of energy . What 's with all the green ? Green is the color of will . The guardians harness will because it 's the strongest energy in the universe . There 's ' so many . The stars you can see from your home planet on the clearest night . Your sector is a thousand times larger . And 3,600 lanterns each with a sector , just as vast . Lanterns , I 've called you here to this unprecedented gathering , because we face an unprecedented danger . Our four lantern brothers were killed by an enemy called , Parallax . An enemy we don 't yet , fully understand . We do know it 's powerful enough to destroy entire civilizations . Powerful enough to defeat even , Abin Sur . Our finest warrior . Who 's like can never be replaced . The guardians have charged me to lead a squadron , of our strongest Lanterns in an assault on , Parallax . We will seek out and find this enemy . And we will destroy it . Alone , we are now vulnerable . United , we are still invincible . We have never been defeated . Will be defeated now ? No ! It was for this moment , that we were created . But I don 't need to tell you , your duty . I don 't need to tell you , who we are . We are the Corp , we are the Corp. We are the Corp , we are the Corp. Your will turns thought into reality . To master the ring you must learn to focus your will , and create what you see in your mind . The rings limits are only what you can imagine . - Do that again . - Now you try . Concentrate . The ring will inform you when there is an imminent threat . This particular threats name is , Kilowog . He 'll be your combat training officer . Never let your guard down , Whoser . Welcome to ring slinging , 101 . Or as I like to call it , the worst day of your worthless life . The human , ain 't never seen one before . - You smell funny . - I smell funny ? Yeah I heard about Humans . Think you 're the center of the universe . You want to be a Lantern ? You got to commit to the Corp. All right , Whoser , let 's see what you got . Your crunch strokes are only going to be as strong as your will . And your will is pathetic . I 'm going to work you . I 'm going to hit you until you 're will is strong enough to be worthy of the Corp. Next lesson . Ha , ha , feel that ? It 's the gravitational pull of your average sun . Makes flying in space , very dangerous . The bigger you are , the quicker you burn . Gravity 's a bitch . Here , let me help you . Remember , your enemy ? He 's not going to play fair . Well , that 's good advice . Thanks , gorgeous . So . This is the human . When I heard Abin Sur 's ring had chosen you , I said it had to have been a mistake . I see nothing to change my mind . I 'll take it from here , Kilowog . The Corp is only as strong as its weakest link . And I will tolerate no weaklings . You understand ? Are you afraid ? Human . Are you afraid ? Don 't . Don 't do that . Shall we ? Sure . A sword . How human . I do believe I smell fear . I 'm a Green Lantern . I fear nothing . Fear is the enemy of will . Will is what makes you take action . Fear is what stops you , and makes you weak . Makes your constructs evil . You must ignore the fear . When you 're afraid you can 't act . You can 't act you can 't think . You can 't think , you die . You reek of fear , Hal Jordan . Abin Sur was a great warrior . My mentor . My friend . You , insult his memory by wearing his ring . I 'm done , he 's right . I 'm only human . Why do I need to defend the universe ? Until a few days ago we thought we were the only ones in the Universe . The ring chose you . It wouldn 't have done so if hadn 't seen something in you . - Oh yeah ? - Something you , yourself don 't yet see . The ring never makes a mistake . This time it did . Many of these little critters that we 've been calling bacteria . Weren 't bacteria at all . They were an entirely different type ... of primitive prokaryotic cell . These little buggers called Archaea 's are still poorly understood . But , might turn out to be different . From bacteria . But might turn out to be as different from bacteria as bacteria is from us . Some people call them extreme philes because they live , ... in the most extreme environments on earth . - Such as ... - God , this is so boring . - Like the boiling waters of a geyser . - * * What a loser . * * Michael . What did you say ? I didn 't say anything . Did you just call me a loser ? * * Holy shit . * * - * * He 's freaky ... * * - Freak ! He 's crazy . Class dismissed . How you been ? Been a while . You had a rough night , last night . Get her name , huh ? You need to get some sleep , son . - Have a seat . - Look , what can I do for you , dad ? Well actually , you 've already done it . For me , and for your country . What are you talking about ? I 'm talking about you impressing a whole lot of very important people . Where did you get that ? I 'm on a subcommittee overseeing the agency 's involvement . - Top secret ... - It was you . That 's why they chose me . Because of this I 'm going to get you a top post on the inside now . Help you oversee the entire operation . There are scientist 's that work their whole lives for this . - People that are more qualified . - Less connected . Don 't be naive , son . That 's the way the world works . You have to seize an opportunity when it presents itself . * * Hilarious , just wasting a life away . * * * * What an embarrassment . * * Phil , how are you ? I 'm terrific . No , no , just finishing up a meeting . Got plenty of time . Sector 2312 Edge of the Milky way Galaxy . With my own eyes I saw this creature induce fear , ... in our finest warriors and then feed on their fear . There 's more . We checked it 's trajectory . Parallax is headed for Oa . Never before has an enemy dared attack us here . You must tell me what you know . Will has always been our sole weapon , ... against the forces of darkness in the universe . But as that power began to seem insufficient . A great debate arose among us . Should we exploit another source of power ? One we had long since sworn , should never be used . Fear . But the power of fear was to unpredictable . The chance of corruption , to great . And so we decided against it . All of us , that is , except one . Alone this guardian entered the forbidden chamber . He wanted to prove the light of fear could be mastered . His intentions were pure . But his hopes were naive . Consumed by the yellow power of fear . The guardian became the evil he had wished to destroy . He became Parallax . For the universe the safety and zone . Abin Sur was charged in imprisoning Parallax in the lost sector . - But he escaped . - Feeding on the fear of others . He grew larger , more powerful . He is now headed here to take his revenge on you and destroy the Corp. Then we have no choice . We must prepare to harness the power of our enemy . And fight fear with fear . To protect our sectors , we must be able to defend ourselves . We must forge a yellow ring . Rough night , huh ? Hector . How you doing ? What have you been up to ? - Same ol ' , same ol ' . - Yeah , me too . Hal Jordan , worst pilot I 've ever seen . ... or the best , I thought sure . - I 've been called both , sir . - Glad you could make it , son . Frankly I was a little surprised I got the invite . No you 're family , huh . I always say there are thinkers in this world and there are doers . And you , are one of the doers . Yeah , but you know the thinkers make what I do awesome . I wouldn 't have a plane to fly unless someone thought it up . Of course . Excuse me , I need a drink . And I got to get back to work . This is work . - Yes , sir . - Nice to see you . - You too , you too . Nice . Yeah , my dad used to train in them . I was talking about your dress . Nice jacket . Last time I checked you didn 't even own one . Yeah , I 've been shaking up the wardrobe lately . Congratulations on the contract . I see you managed to pull that off . I pointed out you owe me one because you broke the rules of engagement . And tell them you figured out the sabers new altitude . So , I guess in a way without even meaning to . You actually did us a favor . Look . I 'm uncomfortable with the word , Hero . Thank you , thank you all for joining us . It 's a great evening . Somebody very special I 'd like to thank for helping us to nail this contract . My daughter . Carol Ferris . Come on . Congratulations , Carol . I take one look at you , young lady . Or Hal Jordan over there . Spitting image of his dad . You give us hope . A toast . To our future . And good health . Hector ! Oh , my god . Hey ! - Congratulations , um . - Thank you . Here 's to you and Hal 's future . Yeah , I rea ... I 'm sorry . I know it couldn 't have been easy , growing up with your dad . But , hey . You 're , you 're doing great so ... I am , I 'm doing great . He 's right though , I 'm not a doer . Although I did get to examine an alien body recently . That was very cool . I can 't tell anyone about it . - But hey , you 're not any ... - You telling one of your science fiction stories ? * * What the hell is wrong with him . He can 't keep his mouth shut . * * You really do have a creative imagination . - Senator . - I apologize , we really must go . - Goodnight , Carol . - Goodnight . - Senator . - Hey . Senator , thanks for everything . Bye , Senator . Get the crash crew here . Our helicopter 's going down . Oh my god . Talking about it for years to come . A helicopter careened out of control to a certain tragedy . When all of a sudden a mystery man , a hero . Saved the day . Incredibly by averting the helicopter from destroying innocent people . And miraculously rescuing Carol Ferris from being crushed by a collapsing building . The real question tonight is , who is this amazing hero ? And where is he now ? Start talking . - A race track ... . Hmm . - Yeah . That 's the best you could come up with ? For your first big appearance . - Racetrack . - I 'm sorry , did I disappoint you ? I materialized a racetrack out of pure energy . Saving hundreds of people , and you 're disappointed , hmm . I 'm sorry about that . No , I want to see this stuff , you 're gonna have to shoe me . Oh , I don 't think that 's a good idea . Come on , I want to see this stuff . - You know , I want to see the outfit . - No , ' cause this isn 't going to work . - The flying . - What do you want me to do , no . - Bring your best friend to locater . - It 's for emergencies ! You owe me ! Hal , I want to see it . Fine . Hold on to your glasses . Question . - You ready to have your mind blown ? - Yeah . Ring ... finger . Here we go . - Did you break it already ? - I didn 't break it . Okay , it 's just ... it 's out of juice . I have to recharge it . Now pay attention . Ahh , green ! - Wow . - I know , right ! Whoooo . - Not bad , huh ? - You 're a superhero . Hey , don 't they always get the girl ? Evening ma 'am . Didn 't get a chance to say goodbye . Are you okay ? Yeah , no I 'm , I 'm good . I didn 't have a chance to thank you . Just doing my job . No thanks necessary , Miss . No , it .. it is . You saved my life . You saved all of our lives that was a very ... - Hal ? - Miss ? Hal ! Oh my God . Oh my God ! Oh my God , Hal ! How did you know it was me ? What do you mean , I 've known my whole life . I 've seen you naked . You don 't think I would , ... recognize you ' cause I can 't see cheekbones ? What is this , why is your skin green ? Why are you glowing ? What the hell is with that mask ? It came with the outfit . Cool , huh ? So it all works because of this magic ring ? No , there 's no such thing as magic . Intergalactic green peacekeepers , that but uh , no . - I 'm not making it up . - No . I mean , when we were kids you called it . I did , actually . I called this early on . I said one day I 'd be a green space cop . Here I am . Okay , so at the party . How did you make that big green ramp thing ? Anything I can see in my mind I can create . - I just have to focus . - Anything ? Anything . Happy Birthday . Better late than never . Okay , so how does it work they just , um . Call you on your cell , " Cat in a tree , downtown milky way " ? No , I don 't think it works exactly like that . Well technically speaking , um ... I actually sort of , uh ... - Quit . - What do you mean , Hal ? Well I mean , it 's a lot like quitting anything else , really . I don 't understand , how do you walk away from something like that ? Is this ... . - Even possible ? - I think we both know I 'm pretty good at walking away . If for once you didn 't quit something you cared about . What 's the worse that can happen ? Well thank you , this has been - a really . - I know I 've made a lot of ... - ... mistakes . - Look , Hal . I 'm not mad at you . I feel bad for you , really . You 've been given so much , so often . You just ... Goodnight . Doctor Hammond . There 's something I 'd like to show you . Something I 'm fairly certain you 'll want to see . - I love you . - Bye , baby . Physical contact accesses mnemonic data . I can see your memories . Dad . Son this is my fault . But I 'm going to fix it . We 're going to get you well again . Whatever it takes . I don 't know what you 're talking about . We detected traces of a second alien life form buried within the body of the first . You 've been exposed . I 've never felt better in my life . We know everything , son . I 've never felt better in my life . " To be chosen to join it 's ranks , is the highest of honors . " " The greatest of responsibilities . " " The ring never makes a mistake . " It 's going to be all right . They just need to run some tests , that 's all . Keep him under . I only want what 's best for you . Run . - Hector . - Shh , don 't worry . I only want what 's best for you . The ring , it chose you . Take it . Hal . Hi . The alien was one of you . How did we end up so different ? Hmm ? Sit , down ! Now . How 's , Carol ? - That came out wrong . - Please . - I know that I 'm already a loser . - Look Hal , I felt bad , really . You 're just as much of a failure as I was . And just as afraid . Well ... I used to fight my fear . But now , that I 've tasted it 's true power . I 'll never go back . NO ! You wear the ring of the Lantern that imprisoned me . You will suffer the same fate . Once I have devoured your world . I will have all the strength I need to defeat the Corp. And destroy the Guardians . Let me get this straight . This thing that 's out there , attacking planets . Is connected to Hector ? Some how it affected him after it killed , Adin Sur . Well you 're just going to have to stop it . Oh , you 're just going to have to stop it . Yeah , well I tried that and I failed and the Senator died . I told you , the ring made a mistake . Wait , go back , how did the ring make a mistake ? The one thing that a Green Lantern is suppose to be , is fearless . Fearless is the job description . - That isn 't me . - So you 're just going to walk away , again . Explain this to me , Hal . Please explain to me just once , why ? Because I 'm afraid ! You don 't think your dad ever felt afraid ? If he did , he figured out someway to beat it . Hmm , yeah , well there 's a word for that . Courage . They said that the ring wouldn 't have chosen me if it didn 't see something . Something I don 't see . Yet . I see it . I always have . The ring didn 't see that you were fearless . It saw that you have the ability to overcome fear . It saw that you 're courageous . But you are . Just like your dad . The Lantern is a threat . Eliminate him . Our new weapon is ready . Once I 've mastered it 's power . I 'll begin training the Corp to do the same . Though Earth will be lost . We 'll be ready to make a stand against Parallax before it reaches Oa . And the power of the enemy will be ours . At what cost ? You dare enter this chamber . I need your help . You got to help me save my world . I know that humans aren 't the strongest species . Or the smartest . We 're young , we have a lot to learn . But we 're worth saving . This new weapon or yours , you can 't use it . Once you cross that line . Once you 've given into fear , you 'll never go back . I 've seen it . Look , I know right now you 're afraid . You dare accuse the guardians of feeling fear ? Yes , I do . And that 's exactly why Parallax is beating you . Because you 're afraid to even admit you 're afraid . I know . I spent my entire life doing it . You know , there 's a saying on earth , we say : " I 'm only human . " We say it because we 're vulnerable , we say it because we know we 're afraid . That doesn 't mean we 're weak . Help me save my planet . Don 't give in to fear . Fight it . Fight it with me . You 're words are compelling , young human . But as immortals we must measure our actions over billions of years . And the fate of the universe . We simply cannot risk loosing everything , ... on the chance you might be right . Then don 't , don 't risk anymore lives . Just mine . Let me go fight for my world . And I 'll show you that will , is stronger than fear . There is no way you can succeed . You will die , Hal Jordan . Well I 'll die trying . Good luck , Green Lantern . I wouldn 't do that . Look closely . She 's beautiful , isn 't she . I loved her from the moment I first saw her . But she could never see me as you were always standing in the way . But not anymore . No , no ! Don 't , don 't do this . Hector , please . Please . I know how you feel . Come on , look at yourself . No , I know what it 's like . To not live up to expectations , to feel that nothing you do will ever be good enough . I know what it 's like to be afraid . Let me help you . Hal , you 've changed . How wonderful that all it took for you to grow up was the end of the world . Now it 's my turn . And if I can 't be like you , then I 'm going to make her like me . And let 's face it . Once she 's like me . You wouldn 't be very interested . Hmm , now would you . Why can 't you ? Hmm ? Why can 't you be like me ? - Huh ? - Let her go . And you can have it . You could do anything . Be anything . Take it . Let her make the choice . Okay . Wow . Now bring her down . Well . I lied . I lied too . You see the way it works , is . You have to be chosen . You have failed me . - Stay here . - No problem . Your will is strong . But not strong enough . You are nothing without the ring . ... please clear the streets . Clear the streets immediately . You can never beat this . You 'll die . At least I can get it away from here . - How do you think you 're going to do that ? - I don 't know . Maybe I can out , out think it or ... A dog fight , right . Those were a couple of jets . Unbeatable jets . The ring chose me for a reason . This is why . Look , I 'll ... probably not . Hey . This is a mandatory evacuation . Everyone must clear the streets immediately . Police emergency everyone must clear the streets , now . - Something 's coming . - RUN ! Get off the bus , now ! Run ! I feel your fear , growing . You will be dead soon . In brightest day . In blackest night . And when you 're gone , I 'll destroy ... - ... everything you 've ever loved . - No evil - shall escape my sight . - Your family Your home , your planet will be no more . Let those who worship evils might . The entire human race will be wiped out . Because you , Hal Jordan . Were afraid . Beware my power . Green Lantern 's light ! The bigger you are , the faster you burn . Though his time wearing the ring has been brief . Hal Jordan 's defeat of Parallax will be remembered as long as the Corp exists . His actions are a reminder of why the ring chose each of us . To overcome fear . And destroy evil where ever it may hide . As Lanterns we must fight with all our will . Our wills have not always been united . It 's time they were . Can I train them , or can I train them . You 're impertinent , Hal Jordan . Your rash , volatile , opinionated . It seems Abin Sur found another just like himself . Wow , I am never getting used to that . My new job requires that I travel . Be away for a while . Away , never gone . - Hal . - Yeah ? Will you take off the mask . That 's really cool . So what happens now ? I 'm going to look for trouble . Of all the Lanterns who have ever worn the ring . There was one who 's light shined brightest . At first his humanity was thought to be a weakness . And yet it proved to be his greatest strength .

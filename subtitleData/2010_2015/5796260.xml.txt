 Chester 's Mill is a place like any other . At least it used to be until we were cut off from the rest of the world by a mysterious dome . Invisible , indestructible , and completely inescapable . We 're trapped . We don 't know where it came from or why it 's here , but now that we 're all trapped under the dome together , none of our secrets are safe . Can I help you ? - Well , what happened to me ? - You don 't remember ? I remember electricity . A little young to be a nurse , aren 't you ? Just a lowly candy striper . You saved Julia . Just like you saved me when the dome came down . Maybe you 're here to save all of us . Barbie , put that weapon down . One person is responsible for all this , Dale " Barbie " Barbara . A warrant has been issued for his arrest . He 's been charged with the attempted murders of Mrs. Shumway and myself . He 's also been charged with the murders of Max Seagrave , Otto Aguilar , and Miss Seagrave 's mother , Agatha . We will hunt down the murderer Dale Barbara . We will bring him in and we 'll make him pay . What if he 's hiding in one of our homes ? Miles , I recognize the threat , believe me . Then why aren 't you knocking down doors ? - Because that 's illegal . - What would you have me do , Miles ? - House sweeps ? - You can search mine . - And mine too . - Mine too . - Yeah , all of our homes . - We want to be safe . Maybe you 're right . But I will not stomp on people 's rights . Our constitution still protects them . This is still the United States of America . No , it 's not . It hasn 't been for two weeks . - You gotta do something , Rennie . - All right . I 'm declaring a state of emergency . That bastard threatens all of us . So today we will perform house sweeps as a safety precaution only . And we 'll bring Barbie to justice . I am not turning our town into a police state just because you say so . It 's not me , Linda . It 's the people . All right , everyone , listen up . This is not the end of Chester 's Mill . This is just the beginning . For all of you who lost jobs when this dome came down , lawyers and bankers like Miles , we 've got jobs for you . We 've got a reservoir that needs to be protected , crops that need tending , streets that need to be cleaned . Yes , it 'll take sacrifice . But we will survive . This dome can 't break us . Chester 's Mill will live to see tomorrow . And the next year . And every year after that . Sir , the satellites are still showing no visual on our target . NSA creeper . Finding Dale Barbara is essential . Good luck , dude . Until we make contact , the operation cannot move forward . I want eyes on that unidentified object . Sir , yes , sir . Any idea where the hell that egg thing is , soldier ? Oh , my God . That 's what burned me . No coordinates on the egg , sir . But any new information will be delivered immediately . It won 't mean a thing until we locate Barbara . He 's the only one inside with the necessary expertise . What 's it doing ? I think it 's mad we didn 't kill Big Jim . Angie , we can 't do that . We all saw the same vision at the big dome , Joe . - It wants him dead . - Why ? I don 't know . Maybe so that he doesn 't kill your monarch . You think Big Jim 's gonna kill Barbie ? From what he 's saying on the radio , it sounds like he wants to . - We need to help him then . - You guys , shut up . We don 't even know that Barbie 's the monarch anyway . Come on , who else could it be ? Any one of us ? Well , we know it 's not Junior . Not the way he ran off last night . Trust me . It 's Barbie . He 's gonna get us out . When the butterfly hatches , you 'll see . When the butterfly hatches ? The monarch will be crowned . I don 't see how it crowns anybody if it 's trapped inside that little dome . I just feel when it comes out of its chrysalis , something 's gonna change . What are you doing ? No , no . Let me see . Oh , my God . What is that ? It 's like the dome 's heart . What do you mean " heart " ? We think it 's the source that powers the whole thing . How long have you had this ? We found it just before Mom died . This is the thing in the woods that showed you Alice ? Yeah . And it sent me home so I could tell her goodbye . All right , you need to move this . They 're gonna be searching all the houses . Hide it . You 're not mad ? Norrie , honey , I 'm on your side , always . And I don 't trust Big Jim with anything . Especially this . Take it to Ben 's . We can trust him . You 're not coming ? I have business with Big Jim . All volunteers , you do not treat any of your neighbors with disrespect . You do not damage property . And you do not kill Dale Barbara . - Yeah , we got it . - Okay , Linda . Go serve and protect . - We 're good to go . - You got it , Linda . Morning , sheriff . Tank 's empty . Sorry . But thanks for the use of your car . No worries . You need an extra hand today ? - Sure do . Let 's go . - All right . Dad . - What 's going on , Junior ? - Dad , I was looking for you all night . Dad , you 're in danger . Someone 's gonna try to kill you . Maybe Barbie , maybe someone else . How do you know this ? I just know . You gotta get a hold of yourself , Junior . Focus . Listen , I got a job for you . Barbie shot Julia Shumway yesterday . - That son of a bitch . - I sent some people over to the clinic , keep an eye out , make sure he doesn 't show up to finish what he started . But I need somebody I can trust , on the inside , guarding her door , protecting her . - Can I count on you ? - Yes , sir . Now , it 's iffy if she 's ever gonna regain consciousness , but , by chance , if she does wake up and start talking , you need to get on that walkie and let me know . No one else . Just me . Okay . But , Dad , just be careful today . Okay . - Big Jim , got a minute ? - Pretty busy this morning , Dodee . No , you have to come to the radio station . I don 't wanna overwhelm the public with more announcements . My receiver picked up the military . They 're searching for Barbie . Barbie ? They 're searching for something else too . Shh ! Hey , hey . - Please don 't scream . - Okay . There are a lot of people looking for you . I know , I know . Listen . Everything that they 're saying about me , none of it is true . - It 's Big Jim ... - I believe you . You do ? Got a lot of good reasons not to trust Jim Rennie . Julia 's still at the clinic . Now , if she wakes up , he 's gonna kill her . - Why ? - Because if she tells people that it wasn 't actually me that shot her , his whole story falls apart . Now he doesn 't have me to use as his scapegoat anymore . Okay , so what do you want me to do ? Candy stripers . You guys have key cards to the clinic 's back entrance . Am I right ? - Yeah . - Yeah . So help me save Julia . How 's she doing ? She was lucky to survive . There 's no telling what kind of neurological damage she might have . - You think she 'll come out of it ? - I 'm not a doctor , Junior . Yeah , but you 're kind of as close to a doctor as we 've got . And I have other patients to check on . I 'll keep an eye on Julia . So , what 's the plan ? I 'm gonna hot-wire the ambulance . Then what ? And then we use your key card to get us in , we get Julia out , you drive us away . Okay , what about the guards ? They 'll swing around to the front sooner or later . No , not them . What about the guards inside ? Big Jim must know you 're coming for her . He might have moved her already . Maybe . There are a lot of ifs here . Listen , Big Jim has taken out every single person that stood in his way . Julia is his last loose end . Now , are you in or are you out ? No sign of the military for over a week , not since they tried to blow us to kingdom come . Now they want Barbie ? I told you , all right ? He 's only part of it . The military 's looking for an egg ? Yeah , and I 've seen it . What 's it do ? I 'm not sure , but it burned the crap out of my hand . One second . I promised Phil I 'd keep the music going . All right , just ... Just don 't touch anything . On the move . Thermalphotography shows the unidentified object has been transported from the woods to two miles northeast of town center . Holy hell . - Any sign of Barbie ? - Negative , sir . Any idea who 's in charge in there ? Sir , the ranking official is a James Rennie . Is he a viable contact for this mission ? Colonel Cox , I would not recommend that . Your reasoning , soldier ? Sir , right after the missile hit , our UAVs did a full perimeter sweep of the dome wall . One drone caught surveillance of this Rennie murdering the town reverend at the bridge roadblock ... - New job , Mr. Alcott ? - No need for banks anymore , Ben . There 's always garbage , though . Ben . Ben . Come on . What 's that ? We have something we have to hide from the sweeps . The gestapo hit my house a while back . - Any chance we can stash it ? - My stash house is your stash house . - More guards ? - Junior . Doing Big Jim 's dirty work . He 's got a walkie . But I think I can take him out before he uses it . No . No what ? Let me . Calm down , Dodee . I am calm . Really . But what they said you did ... I thought what happened to Reverend Coggins was an accident . No , he was an accident waiting to happen . I mean , he almost burned down the whole town the day after we got stuck here . He 's a liability . You don 't know the whole story , Dodee . And neither do those Peeping Toms with their eyes in the sky . How many accidents have there been ? Those other people , the ones that you said Barbie killed ... ? Barbie is no saint , believe that . But he didn 't do it , did he ? Oh , he did more than enough to deserve whatever punishment he 's got coming to him . Every one of those people got what they had coming to them . They were threats to Chester 's Mill . All I 've ever done was protect the people of this town . Think I 'd hurt them ? Or you ? No . I don 't think that . Well , good . So let 's help each other out here , focus on this egg . You have that photograph of it , where 'd you take it ? It was at Joe McAlister 's barn . I didn 't even remember until this morning . I was thinking it could even be the generator . The generator ? - For what ? - The dome . Look , maybe if you get this thing , you could bring down the dome . I can get it for you . I can help . All right , I can be useful . Well , Dodee , you 're already very useful . But that dome can 't come down . Not now . - Big Jim ? - Yeah , what is it , honey ? You 're a sick bastard . And one day , everyone 's gonna know it . And they 're gonna smile when you die . Linda ? Linda , it 's Jim . - Where are you ? - Sweeping the southwest quadrant . The radio station 's on fire . What ? Dodee was covering for me . Is she okay ? - Jim , any word on Dodee ? - I don 't know . It 's a mess . The fire volunteers are gathering but you need to get down there . Could it be arson ? No idea . It 's Barbie . We 've been broadcasting info about him night and day . - Jim , I 'm on it . - All right , be careful , Linda . - If you find Barbie , you call me . - Roger . Phil , come on . So you really think this is the engine ? It could be our way out of here . - It 's awesome . It 's like a lava lamp . - Hey , don 't touch it . Last person who did got hurt . All you have to do is keep it covered , keep your parents away from it , and keep an eye on it . - Where you gonna be ? - Home . I gotta stop Angie from doing something stupid . - It 's in good hands . - Thanks , Ben . We 'll be back to get it later . Hey . Angie . - What are you doing here ? - Just helping out like I used to . Are you okay after what we saw last night ? Sure . - Then why 'd you run off ? - To protect my dad . To stop anyone from hurting him . - Do you trust your dad ? - Of course I do . You didn 't always . When we were going out , you called him a fraud . - Are you guarding Mrs. Shumway ? - Barbie shot her yesterday . Is that what your dad said ? He wouldn 't lie to me about that . But if Barbie didn 't shoot her , then Julia 's the only witness , right ? Did Big Jim tell you what to do if she woke up ? Leave me alone , Angie . Junior , I 'm sorry . My head is a mess . I ... I don 't know what anything means anymore . I just need someone to talk to . Someone or me ? You . You 're the only one who understands what I 'm going through . But can we go somewhere private ? I feel like she can hear everything we say . I said I 'd watch her . Just for a minute . Please ? I need you . We found her body in the station . There was nothing we could do . Thanks . Phil , I 'm so sorry . Why 'd he do it ? Why did he do it ? Dodee never hurt anyone . I don 't know . But Barbie won 't get away with it . I promise . I just don 't know how much more of this I can take . Hey , you don 't have to do it alone . I 'm always gonna be with you . It feels so good just to hold you again . I know . It does . You taste like cigarettes . Junior ? Miss Hill , let me tell you how much we don 't have time for this . Let me tell you , Mr. Rennie , how much a lawyer knows about illegal searches . If you don 't have a search warrant , which you do not , you 're gonna need one of four things . Consent from the owner , clear visibility of the inside , a suspect already under arrest ... Or exigent circumstances . I don 't know what you call a murderer on the loose , but I call that extremely exigent . I call it just one more day in this damn hellhole and respectfully request that you leave . Request respectfully declined . - No . Stop this now . - Come on . - Where you going ? - Stop it . Get off of me . Hey , leave her alone . Don 't you touch my mother . - Norrie , no . - Let them go . - Back away . - Norrie , stop . - Norrie . - Let them go . - Norrie . Norrie , stop . - Get back here . I wonder what you 're so bent out of shape of me seeing in here . What the hell ? - Where is it ? - Where 's what ? Don 't play games with me on this one , little buddy . That damn egg . I know all about it and I know what it 's for . We have no idea what you 're talking about . Take these two to the station . - On what charges ? - Let 's go . Obstruction of justice . - Let her go . Norrie . - Move it . I 'll fix it . I 'll get you out . Barbie ! Linda , Barbie 's at the clinic . Barbie 's at the clinic . Junior , I 'm 30 seconds away . I love you . Barbie , we gotta go . - Drive fast . - What ? Why ? Go . Stay hidden . They 're not gonna come looking if they 've got me . - What are you doing ? - Go ! Get her out of here now ! Put your hands on your head . Get your ass to the ground . Hey . Get ... Get back . Go . Jim , got him . Good . But Angie McAlister took off with Julia . Don 't worry . We 'll get her too . Norrie ? Norrie , come over here and talk to me , please . Angie was right . Angie was right about what ? We should 've killed Big Jim when we had the chance . Why would the dome want us to do that ? Look what he 's doing , Joe . Pulling all these Nazi moves ? Breaking into your barn like he owns the place ? - That doesn 't mean we should kill him . - Really ? What do you think 's gonna happen when he finds Barbie ? Your monarch won 't be crowned , Joe . It 's more like the monarch gets his head chopped off . You know that quote ? Says , " The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing . " That 's us , Joe . Well , well , look at Little Miss Well-Behaved . Joe ? Joe , I 've known you your whole life . You 're a decent kid . A smart kid . - Not like your sister . - Angie 's smart . She 's helping Barbie , throwing in all her chips on a losing hand . Aiding and abetting a violent fugitive . She may be past help , but you , you , Joe , you can fix this . Tell me where it is and we 'll forget any of this happened . I 'll let you go home , both you and your , uh ... Your new friend . If this egg thing really is the generator of the dome , like I 've heard , you keeping it squirreled away is a very serious offense . Impeding a lawful investigation . You got something to say , little lady ? So why do they call you Big Jim ? You 're just some loser trying to scare kids . I 'm sorry . I didn 't quite hear that . You wanna say that again ? You don 't scare me . You 're old enough to understand how this goes . The easy way is you tell me what I wanna know , you walk out that door , you 're free . Now , the hard way ... Well , let 's just say your mother has come to so much grief already . It 'd be a shame if you caused her any more misery . Norrie . I gave you kids a chance . You wanna burn with Barbie , be my guest . Heading back to the station . We have Barbie in custody . No eyes yet on Julia Shumway . Last seen in an ambulance driven by Angie McAlister away from the clinic . That really necessary ? Did Big Jim tell you to do it ? All of these things that I 'm being accused of ? Come on , I would never hurt Julia . You gotta know that . Yeah ? What about her husband ? That 's what I thought . Here to report a crime ? I won 't leave the premises until my daughter and Joe McAlister are released . It 's a public building . You stay as long as you like . So , what 's the good word ? Nothing on Julia and Angie McAlister , but we got an APB out . Sooner or later , we 'll get them . Okay , well , sooner would be better than later . A woman in Julia 's condition needs watching . Do we know if she 's come out of her coma yet ? No clue . What about Barbie ? He 's downstairs in lockup . Good . Now what ? We let him sweat . What are you doing ? Get off me . - Barbie , don 't tell him anything . - We 'll be okay . Hey . Where are you taking them ? Let 's just call it an undisclosed location . - I swear , if you hurt those kids ... - Tell you what , seeing as you 're in no position to make any threats , how about I do the talking ? So here 's the situation . You 're going to confess to the charges and you 're gonna do it in public . Not gonna happen . Well , that 's your prerogative . I 'll tell you what will happen if you choose not to cooperate . Won 't be long before we catch up with Angie McAlister . And when we do , we 'll charge her as an accessory to your crimes , seeing as she 's been so helpful to you . And her brother Joe and that little firecracker he 's been rubbing noses with , it 's no leap to link them to the death of Dodee Weaver , seeing as Dodee knew all about this mysterious object that they 're taking such great pains to keep to themselves . Then there 's your redhead . If she ever comes out of her coma , she 'll go down for hiring a known criminal to murder her husband for the insurance money . Now , that 's as cold as cold-blooded gets . So , what do you say , Barbie ? We got a deal ? You let the kids go and you leave Angie and Julia alone , and I 'll say what you want me to say . I 'd say we shake hands , but ... Hey , Jim . How do I know you 're gonna keep your word ? You don 't . Are you all right ? If that man did anything to you ... I 'm all right , Mom . We need to check on the mini-dome , make sure it 's safe . - Put a tail on those kids . - Why ? They 're hiding something . Something that might help us understand - why we 're trapped under this thing . - Something like what ? It 's tough to say , but it could be our way out . - You really think so ? - If we 're lucky . - What happened at the clinic , Junior ? - I 'm sorry . I tried my best ... All right , well , you get a second chance now . Get out there and find your little girlfriend , bring her and Julia Shumway back here , pronto . What 's the problem , Junior ? What 's so important about finding Julia ? Barbie 's locked up . He can 't hurt her anymore . Well , he can 't , that 's true . But who knows what other traitors he 's got out there ready to pull the trigger for him ? Better safe than sorry , I say . I love you , Dad . But don 't lie to me . That would be very bad for both of us . He confessed , son . He confessed to everything . And soon , he 's gonna stand in front of the town and confess to them too . Okay ? Let 's get back to work . Oh , I was gonna ask you , last time you saw her , uh , Julia , was she conscious ? Okay . Okay . What 's wrong ? Your freaky sphere is going crazy , man . Show us . Julia ? Hey , hey , it 's Angie . You need to be quiet . Here . Here . Shh . Somebody shot me . Do you remember who ? A woman . I 'd never seen her before . - Where are we ? - We 're in the clinic . In the storage room . It may be stupid , but I thought it was the last place they 'd look for us . Barbie and I snuck you out of the clinic in an ambulance earlier , but I doubled back and left the ambulance behind a billboard on the road . Got you down here on a service elevator . Why ? Big Jim has been telling everyone Barbie 's the one who shot you . - What ? He 's ... - Okay , okay . He 's lying . What you just said is exactly why we have to hide you . Where 's Barbie ? Listen up . Please , can I have your attention ? We 've all been through a hell of a lot these past two weeks . Lived through this unprecedented event . Suffered some terrible losses . And it may seem like the rules that all of us were raised with no longer apply . But let me tell you this . Even though we may be separated from the world outside , even though there 's no government beyond this hall which you see in front of you today , rules are necessary . And when rules are broken there must be justice . And where appropriate , punishment . Dale Barbara stands accused of the murders of Maxine and Agatha Seagrave , Otto Aguilar and Peter Shumway , and for the attempted murder of Julia Shumway . I 've brought him before you here today to answer for those crimes . Cover your ears . Here , lie back . What do you think they 'll do to him ? They 're gonna kill him . To the charges brought against you , Mr. Barbara , how do you plead ? What is that ? I asked you a question , Mr. Barbara . How do you plead ? Not guilty .

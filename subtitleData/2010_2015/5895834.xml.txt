 Previously on Alphas ... - Gary ? - Nina , Gary 's in trouble . He needs us . They came . - I 'm here for Gary , not you . - Right . What happened between the two of you ? I woke up . Yeah , is that what you call pushing everyone you meet ? You need help . I need to run the program . I decide what happens to the Alphas we locate , I approve of the assignments , and with no interference . Gary and I just found something that is huge . This is from the Civil War . There 's Stanton Parish . Out there somewhere , planning God knows what . Let 's get to work . Hello , Dr. Westman . Jay ? ? Alphas 2x02 ? The Quick and the Dead Original Air Date on July 30 , 2012 ? Don 't say no ? ? for an answer ? ? and there 's no telling ? ? where we 've been ? ? ? ? ' cause people don 't understand ? ? understand , understand ? ? people don 't understand ? ? people like me ? = = sync , corrected by elderman = = What 's wrong ? Nothing . It 's just , uh ... now that your dad 's back ... when he asked me to check in on you , I 'm not sure this is what he had in mind . Oh , I don 't know . He did grow up in the ' 60s . Dani , when we tell him , things are bound to get weird . And then , of course , there 's Nina . - Mm-mm-mm . - Mm . No ex-girlfriends in the bed . I like this . I don 't want it to change . Well ... well , we don 't tell him . - Send the files over . - All right . They 're gonna want a pros and cons ... Details , just got ' em . Morning , Dr. Rosen . - Uh , good morning ... - It 's my chow ! - Whoever you are . - No one is allowed to use it ! - Where 's my pudding ? - It 's only my stuff ! That 's a rule ! No excuses ! - Agent Bell , listen ! - No , don 't touch me . - Hey , hey , hey ! - Get away from me ! What is going- - easy , easy . Easy , partner . - Gary , Gary ... - Gary , please . Gary , you know better than to shove people like that . What happened ? They provoked me ! I 'll show you ! Look . Where 's my pudding ? Hadn 't even expired- - with this crap ! Gary . - None of this is mine ! - Gary , Gary . It 's all theirs ! Well , maybe he didn 't understand how important your shelf is to you . You want to start arguing with office mates- - No , no ! I shouldn 't have to explain . My name was on there ! Well , we 'll put your name back , all right ? No , no ! It 's not all right ! 'Cause even if it 's just my pudding , it 's still stealing . It 's stealing ! He should go to jail ! Gary . - Bill , arrest him . - Okay- - - Don 't provoke me ! - Don 't touch him . All right ? Don 't touch him . Dr. Rosen ! I 'm slamming my door ! - Hey ! - Hey . Suck up all those little dust mites yet ? Hey , I just cleaned there . No , you know what , actually ? It 's dead skin . Whose , I have no idea . The really nasty stuff was on the phone . Just breathing through it . Fake it till you make it . She in yet ? You know Nina isn 't the most prompt person in the world . Hmm . It 's gonna be weird , isn 't it ? You two working here together ? No , no . We 're ... we 're cool . Really ? ' Cause your pupils just dilated . And your heart rate is up . Good to have you back , Rach . Gotta love that government start paperwork . You know , to be honest , I did enjoy putting " mental institution " under " previous address . " I see we have quite a few new faces here . Analysts mostly ... here to support you and your team . Yeah , which , loosely translated , means " keeping an eye on me . " You 're an indicted felon who was on a court-ordered psych hold . Had to call in a lot of favors to get you out . Well , let 's not pretend it was an act of benevolence , Nathan . You need me . I 'm not your enemy , Lee . If you 're gonna accomplish anything , we 're gonna have to do this together . Fair enough . Perhaps you can tell me something about this . TNK America crash . Uh ... Cargo train exploded outside of Jersey City . Destroying 9 tons of high-sulfur coal 13 tons of pressure-treated lumber , and 30 cars of copper wire and municipal-grade electrical equipment . Yeah , it set the Con Ed maintenance schedule back six months . What 's on your mind ? With every loss , there is often a beneficiary . I 'm just wondering ... who benefited from this . The FBI have any suspects ? It was an accident . I saw the preliminary D.O.T. report . There was no evidence of a device . That 's exactly how Stanton Parish operates . In the shadows . His signature is often no signature at all . Is that what this is about ? Your 200-year-old Alpha bogeyman ? You advocate bloodshed and war . Nothing that you or I can do to stop that . It 's inevitable . You 'll forgive me if I try . Well , I wish he were , as you intimate , a delusion . But he is very real , Nathan , and , I believe , extremely dangerous . So , uh , we gotta keyword hit . NYPD . We have an assault and possible abduction . A whole lotta weirdness . Good to have you back , Lee . May I see that , please ? Why don 't you just get settled in , and Hicks and I 'll take care of it . I 'm settled in fine . May I see that ? He stepped here ... and here . Then there . Whatever . Doc , listen . Witness statements say that whoever attacked this guy , no one actually saw him . So what 's up with Gary-vision ? Eat my pudding at 2 : 30 . But I can 't , because it was stolen . Gary , please , we need your help . Yeah , I know . Ok , I found a blur . We 're looking for someone blurry . And , Bill ! It 's not Gary-vision . It 's electromagnetic perception . Right . Here . - How fast is that footage ? - Four frames a second , or five . They should upgrade , though . Bill , this guy is moving ... almost ten times normal human speed . All the while , dragging a grown man . He must be burning at least 10,000 calories an hour . My pudding had calories . Now I 'm never gonna get to taste them . Wait . I found the same blur . Here . Broadway and 9th . There . He 's crossing the street . Not--Dr . Rosen , he 's not using the walk signal . That 's reckless . That 's five blocks from the kidnapping . Bill , let me speak with Rachel , please . Right . - Gary- - - Hello . Rachel , it 's safe to say , we 're looking for an Alpha with an extraordinarily accelerated metabolism , which means his body could literally be eating itself . - Okay . - So , uh , you should be on alert for an odor . Something like , um , bad breath or rotten meat . So , basically , he was emitting ketones ? You could have just said that , Dr. Rosen . I smell cheese and pasta , sour wine and ... lilac perfume . New girlfriend ? I accidentally bought the wrong soap . - Really ? - Yeah . You did ? That 's definitely the wrong soap , Hicks . - It 's this way , you guys . - Yes . It 's definitely in here- - the scent . Man , this place stinks . You smell that ? I don 't know , Doc , it seems like some sort of ... fish , uh , processing plant or something . You know , I think we need to call in tactical . Bill , this is a kidnapping . We do not have time to wait for a TAC-team . Every second counts . Kind of lost the scent . All I smell is fish . - We got this , Rachel . Back out . - Okay . Hey , check this out . It 's wiped down . Somebody must have grabbed it . Look at this . Don 't touch that . Remember , you don 't want to put prints on those . All right , we 'll , uh- - plan " B , " then . Why don 't you do your thing and ... rip this puppy off . Watch this . Brains over brawn . Works every time . Oh , oh , ouch ! You okay ? What the hell ? I traced the prints on the screwdriver to Eli Aquino . One arrest , a couple years ago , for stealing cars in Queens . Now this guy was chased for four blocks by a motorcycle cop . Was clocked at 45 miles an hour , on foot . Yeah , which brought him to the attention of the D.O.D. , who decided to forgo the constitutional niceties of due process , and directly sent him to Building Seven . He was out as soon as Scipio and his guys opened the doors . Yeah , good . That was a bad place . Hey , Binghamton sent Eli 's medical records . They should be in the drop box . Rachel , I thought you had taken a break . I 've seen dead bodies before . No , that 's not what we talked about ... I believe Rachel can decide for herself . Gary , can you get that drop box ? Yep . Oh , yes . Just as I suspected . Eli has an enlarged suprachiasmatic nucleus . This is the region of the brain that controls our circadian rhythms , and this accounts for his enhanced speed . But it comes at quite a high price . Gary , would you go back to the picture of- - yes , this one . Now this is Eli when he was arrested two years ago . And there should be another photo . Yes . And this is his high school yearbook picture . Four years ago . Four years ago ? That would make him 22 . But he looks so much older now . That 's because he is , Rachel . He ages at an ever-accelerating rate . It 's a condition similar to progeria , but it 's much more acute . Okay , so what happened . I mean , getting older doesn 't turn you into a murderer . This guy have " kill a guy with a screwdriver " on his bucket list ? He doesn 't have a history of violence . As far as we know , Bill . Gary , would you check and see if there have been any similar crimes since the breakout ? Bill , I think we should bring Mrs. , uh , what 's her name ? Already on it . Have them bringing up the victim 's wife . So I 'll see if she 's got a connection to Eli . In the meantime , Rachel and Hicks can check out incident reports . Lot of work to do , folks . Let 's go . Hey , how 's it going ? Miss anything exciting ? Uh ... uh , no . Just the , uh , usual craziness . Glad I slept in . No ! Don 't even think about it ! Government jerk-ass ! Gary , take it easy , relax . No , that 's what he is . A jerk-ass . It 's good . He fears me now . Oh , hey , Nina . You 're late . We start at 9 : 00 a.m. So nice to be back . Oh , Hicks , I can 't find anyone else who was killed with a screwdriver . I found some other people who were killed with wrenches , though . Yeah , screwdriver 's not the important part , Gary . Uh , Eli 's fast . Speed . We 're looking for speed . Oh , well , why didn 't you tell me that in the first place ? And Hicks ... You need to respond to your texts . You 've got six texts . If someone sends you one , then you should respond to those , when someone sends you- - Okay , Gary , I 'll take care of that . Thanks . He never answers his texts . What did you have for breakfast ? You had something good . It says ... It says , " this morning was yummy . " Did you have pancakes ? Gary , that stuff is private . We 've talked about that , haven 't we ? Oh , it 's Dr. Rosen 's daughter . You had pancakes with Dani Rosen ? Gary , I swear to you , listen . Now you tell anyone about this , I will kill you . No , you wouldn 't kill me . That 'd be premeditated homicide . You 'd go to jail . You 'd go to jail . Oh , what 've you got there ? Too much . What do you think ? What is it ? Van Gogh ? That 's an amazing print . Print . Right . Nina . What ? Nin- - Don 't start , okay ? It 's beautiful . This is very upsetting . What are you gonna do ? Just push whomever shows up here to reclaim this when they realize- - I like it . It matches the couch . Nina , your life is out of control . And it 's more than just the painting . You know it is . You also know what you need to do to reclaim it . Show up here on time , you have to honor your commitments , and no pushing unless absolutely necessary , or I can 't have you on this team . Right ? Sorry . Hi , Nina . Nice painting . I think Bill needs help interviewing the wife , so- - Sure . I 've never seen him before . I 've already been through this with the police . All right . She doesn 't know anything . We need to be sure . Are you in charge here ? 'Cause I need to go . I have funeral arrangements to make . Yes , I understand , ma 'am . We 're moving as quickly as we can . Now , this young lady 's gonna ask you a few questions . If it 's all right , hmm ? Gently . Calm down . What do you know about him ? Nothing . I 've never seen him before . Like I said , she doesn 't know anything . Great . Is there anything else we should know ? Anything you 're hiding ? I had an affair with Jay 's brother . We never paid taxes on any of the money that Jay made at the clinic in Stamford . I stole a scarf once from Bloomingdale 's , because I just didn 't want to stand in line . Okay , thank- - thank you very much . I masturbate every day , when Jay goes to work . Nina . Thank you . What ? No , you 're not sorry ! You people are always in my way . I 'm trying to do important work here . Gary , Gary , you all right ? No , he made contact with me . - You okay ? - I don 't like these people . Well , listen , to tell you the truth , I don 't either , but we have to work with them for now , so just try to be more polite . Maybe you should just ignore them , all right ? Listen , have you come up with any similar crimes ? Barely any . Just one so far . Similar to Dr. Westman 's ? Yeah , just like it . Abduction on 8th and Ellis . And the people there said that all they saw was a blur . But that 's the only one I found , so I 'm gonna keep looking . Well , we 'll need to speak with the investigating officer . He 's not there yet . The police only just got the call . Happened eight minutes ago . What ? Eight minutes ago ? Gary ! Wh- - Yeah . Just happened . Maybe the victim is still alive . Well , yeah , his number 's listed , and he has a service . Do you want me to ping his cell ? Yes , yes , immediately . Please . - Okay . - Bill ? You saw me once a week for six months . You expect me to believe that , huh ? I saw many patients . I 'm sorry . I don 't remember ! Let me tell you something . You know what ? It doesn 't even matter , okay ? 'Cause you 're a dead man . You 're a freaking dead man . I 'm gonna cut your throat . Move it ! Move ! Patrol the block ! He kept saying that he was a patient of mine . But I 'm telling you , I have no idea who he is . Uh , perhaps you will recognize him now , hmm ? That kid . What does he have to do with this man who attacked me ? It 's the same person- - Eli Aquino . He suffers from accelerated aging . Okay , who are you people , anyways ? And why am I not speaking to the police , here ? Because we are the ones that saved your ass . We work with the police , Dr. Casey . Now you 're gonna need some protection . But in order for us to provide you that , we 're gonna need your cooperation . Otherwise , you 're gonna look like this , if he comes back looking for you . That 's Jay Westman . Was Jay Westman . He worked for the Yankee Medical Group . Is that a clinic in Stamford , Connecticut , by any chance ? Yes . Well , what were you doing there ? We were researching therapies in pediatric hyperactivity . Mmhmm . I was not in charge of anything . I just administered the BWE . And that 's all . You administered the BWE ? What is that ? Brainwave entrainment therapy . Uses light and sound to alter brain structures . Highly controversial . As far as I know , that has not progressed beyond the experimental stage . Wait , what are we saying ? That he 's using kids as guinea pigs ? Listen , all those parents signed releases . And we did do some very significant research . Yeah , well , your significant research is coming back to kill you . Easy now . That should help with the pain . Thank you . It 's better than morphine , and you don 't need a prescription . The doctor 's don 't think that she 'll come back for a last good-bye . Meaning , she 'll have a few long , gray , painful weeks , and ... then she 'll be gone . That 's awful . No one should have to bury a grandchild . I 've buried 31 . She 's the last . She was a lovely child . She only knew me as a distant cousin . I 'm glad we spent time together . How 's your father ? Now that he 's amongst the free ? Anxious ? You could ... talk to him . Explain how things could be . You said you wanted to reach out to him . He needs to get there on his own . At least part of the way . And Cameron ? He 's good . He 's a nice guy . Which is kind of a first for me . Hmm . I hope that you two can remain friends . What ? With your father back , you can 't afford to lose control of your emotions . You know how you get when you 're involved . We all make sacrifices . Hey ! This is nice surprise , huh ? Couldn 't get through the day without a little Hicks fix ? That was literally my best line . Come on . What 's up ? Look , Cam , uh ... I like you ... a lot . Yeah . Um , and this has been great . " This has been great " ? Where is this going ? It 's like you said , um , my dad 's back now , and things are too complicated . So , um , I think it 's probably best if we just end this . Now where is this coming from ? Come on . Come on , we have a connection , right ? No , no , look . We have a connection , and I 'm not talking about him . It 's brain chemistry , Cam . - No , no , Dani , that is not it . - It 's the way my ability works . Dani , that 's not it . Look , every guy I 've ever been with has said the same thing , okay ? It 's a hyperlimbic feedback loop . What you 're feeling , it 's not real . Listen to me . - No , we 're not ... - Dani . - Real , okay ? - Dani , don 't do this , okay ? Sorry . It 's unbelievable , what this guy 's been doing with these kids . Forget pulling his license , this guy needs to go to jail . You 're right , of course , but we have to let him go . What are you talking about ? Bill , it 's only a matter of time before Eli tries to get at Dr. Casey again . And , uh , when he does , you and Cameron will be waiting . You want to use him as bait ? Doc , are you- - do you know how fast Eli is ? Casey will be dead , and Eli will be gone . Yeah . And I also know how fast Cameron can react . And you too , when you need to . And what , with the support Gary is providing , I am betting on this team . Doc , there is no team . Whatever team we have is not ready . I think they are ready , Bill . Why are you doubting my decision ? 'Cause I 've been here for the last eight months , every day , okay ? Yeah , mmhmm . And you 've been back--what ? - - Less than a week ? Listen , Bill , I know what you 're going through . I went away , and things fell apart . And you took control of the team . And now I 'm back , and it 's causing you a lot of anxiety . Losing control has never been something you 've been comfortable with . This about me losing control ? Is that what you 're saying ? - Listen . - I 'm a control freak ? Bill , you 've taken care of things marvelously since I 've been gone . You and I both know what happened here is because of your ego . Excuse me ? You went on national television talking about Alphas . Yes . Without telling us ? Without telling me ? Why did you pull that stunt ? Because I needed to . No , no , what you needed . You needed to hear your name . You needed to make some kind of statement , and we were left to clean up the mess . Hell , yes , I 've got doubts ! If you truly feel that way , maybe you should just go . Yeah . Wouldn 't want to be on the other end of that thing . Just tranq darts . We 're laying a trap for Aquino tonight . Look ... I know you 're angry , and ... I get it . No , seriously , Nina , I 'm over it . Well , I 'm not . I never should have used my ability on you . Sometimes it just ... it happens , and ... I didn 't even know I was using it . And we had something . And ... I ruined it . It 's okay . No , it 's not . I want to make things right . I want us to try again . Look , Nina , I 'm seeing someone . What ? Who ? Doesn 't matter . No , I want to know . It doesn 't make any difference . Tell me who she is ! Nina , what 's wrong ? Don 't pretend you didn 't know , okay ? Because you know everything ! It seems quiet . You sure the entrances are clear , Gary ? Yeah , don 't worry . I 'm on my game . Dr. Casey 's building has really good cameras . Anything , Hicks ? - Uh , sorry , what ? - Come on , focus , bro . Know Casey 's a douche , but we 're supposed to keep him alive . Hicks is distracted by his girl problems . Ha ! I don 't have girl problems , so I have complete focus . You 're having problems with Nina , huh ? No , he had breakfast with Dani Rosen , and she said that it " was yummy . " But Hicks wouldn 't tell me what they ate . - Is that so ? - Hmph . Wait , Hicks , was breakfast not really breakfast ? Was breakfast sex ? I am not having this conversation right now . - Hicks , I broke your sex code . - Dani Rosen ? With either one of you . Nina 's not returning any of my calls . Dr. Rosen I 've never seen her this upset . I don 't know what to do- - Well , Rachel , um ... she 'll be fine . She 's just working on some things . I 've seen her like this before . And ... you shouldn 't worry about it . - Do you need some help ? - Uh , no , no . I 'm all right . Why don 't you go home ? You can get some rest . You know what ? I 'm gonna go to the stakeout . Eli 's really fast , and the guys could use an extra set of eyes . You 're right , Rachel . Thank you . Nina- - Eli ? Please . Don 't make me hurt you . I 'm not here to kill you , but I ... I will if you don 't do what I want . Well , what is it that you want , Eli ? I just- - I want you to stop this . Please . Is that why you killed Dr. Westman ? Be-because he wouldn 't help you ? No , he just--he didn 't care . He pretended like he didn 't remember me . Like I just--I didn 't- - I was nothing . Like I didn 't matter . I 'm not like those doctors , Eli . I promise you , I do not see you that way . I 'm 22 years old ! Look at me ! It was wrong , what they did to you . Eli , I know how precious time is to you . I will do everything I can as quickly as I can to help you , but I need you to trust me . Please . Are you really having sex with Dani ? Oh , did we not finish talking about this ? I mean she 's Dr. Rosen 's daughter . - Please , somebody , say yes . - No , I don 't understand . Okay , you break up with Nina , because she used her ability on you , but then you like it when Dani does ? It 's manipulation both ways . - No , it 's totally different . - How ? Well , you know , hot steamy sex is always different . So that 's the difference , huh ? Hot sex ? No , it 's not- - Listen , it 's about a connection , okay ? Now Dani says it 's her ability , but ... I 'm telling you , I never felt this way , but , please , let it go . This is wrong . Mindblowing sex could never be wrong , ever . No , this . This is wrong . Okay , we 've been here for too long . Eli--he 's not patient , right ? He doesn 't have time- - What , are you the Eli expert , now ? Come on now . In the office , I felt something . Bill , I think we 're waiting in the wrong place . Come on , you two . Gotta try to stay still , but I 'm just , You know , I 'm not good at it . What does it say ? Uh , Eli , I know this is difficult for you . Just . We 're getting there . And I just want you to know that the MRI is just one of many tests that I 'm going to need to run . Oh , God . They ran me through a million of those things at Stamford . Well , do you remember the names of any of them ? Of course , I don 't . Or any of the equipment they used ? All I know is they kept putting me through stuff , and things just got worse . I just kept getting older and faster , and older and faster . Maybe that was their intention . Who 's this dude ? I know him . You know Stanton Parish ? I don 't know his name . But I saw him a few times at the clinic . Wait , wait . He was a patient ? No , man , he ran the joint . Why do you have his picture ? Do you work for him or something ? No , no , no . I most certainly do not work for him . Eli , what else can you tell me about him . How about nothing , all right ? He 's not the important one here . I am . So let 's focus on me a little bit , okay ? Focus . Rosen 's phone is on voicemail . I 'm gonna call Cley . Dani ? Cam , it 's me . Look , I 'm at the office . There 's a guy here with my dad . It just--I don 't know . It doesn 't feel right . - Who the hell is this ? - It 's my daughter . She just called somebody ! She 's screwing the whole thing up ! Listen , Eli . Listen to me please . I promised to help you and I will . Now you want some answers ? I think I know where we can find some . Just leave my daughter out of this . She has nothing to do with this . You okay ? You all right ? He took my dad . I don 't know where . Okay . Gary I need you to ping Dr. Rosen 's phone now . His phone 's at the office , but it 's broke . But he has the extended warranty , so that 's okay . I don 't care , okay ? Do what you have to do to find him . Let 's go . Okay , he just went past the camera at 287 . He 's going really fast and he 's going to get a ticket . Oh , but there 's road construction . Want you to watch for upcoming exits , okay ? Find us an alternate route . We need to catch up to them . Dani , don 't worry , we won 't lose ' em . It was here . The medical clinic was here ? 427 Addison . You 're sure about this ? Yankee Medical Group ? Yeah , I remember that church . Well , I 'm sorry Eli . I 'd hoped we 'd find some answers here . What now ? More tests ? Yes , we can do that . No . Oh , man . This is so unfair . I just want things to go back to the way they were . I have to be honest with you . That 's not going to be possible . We may be able to slow down the process , but it cannot be reversed . You told him where we were going ? No , no , I didn 't . - No , you did ! - I promise you , I didn 't . You never wanted to help me . You 're just like all the rest . Over there . They 're in the church . I can slit his throat faster than you can pull that trigger . Cameron , no ! No one is killing anyone here today ! I 'm gonna die anyway . Listen to me , Eli . You could have years left to live . Don 't throw that away . - You said I could trust you . - Yes , and you can . I know how desperate you feel right now . No , you don 't . Nobody does . There 's nobody like me . - Dani , stay back ! - Eli . - Dani . - It 's okay . You shouldn 't have followed us here tonight . I can help . Oh , my God . It feels so good to slow down . Thank you . Dani ! Who took the shot ? Who took that shot ? He was just a kid . An investigation is currently underway . It 's still not clear who took the shot . So you guys are saying you didn 't do a chamber check ? An investigation is underway . Uh , Nathan , we have complete confidence in you and your team . I 'm sure Agent Harken wasn 't trying to imply anything . I appreciate that . I know you 'll get to the bottom of this . But said , uh , I 'm sure you can see that my team is a little out of sync at the moment . It 's entirely my fault . I take full responsibility for that , 'cause I really haven 't been able to make them comfortable with all the changes around here . I get it , we 're jammed in here pretty tight . Yes , we are . It would be easier if we had a little more space- - breathing room , if you will . Believe me , my people are saying the same thing . Well , I 'm not surprised . Um , but , you know , we may all be in luck . Bill , was it you who told me about the third floor being available for lease ? Yeah , I did . I told you about the third floor . Third floor ? Yeah , the entire third floor . I 'll look into it . Played that one really well , Doc . " An investigation is under way " ? You looked like you wanted to strangle him for that , but- - Bill , I told that young man that he could trust me . And- - and he was gunned down just- - Listen , Bill , um- - what you said earlier , about my motives , my hubris , there 's probably a lot of truth in that . I have let you all down in some fashion . And , uh , and I hope to make it up to you . Look , um , I wanted to be straight with you . Please . I want to be with him . I appreciate your candor . You deserve to be happy . As does Mr. Hicks . Just be careful . Hey , where 's Nina ? Has anyone heard from her ? Hicks hasn 't . But he has heard from Dani . He calls her " baby " , which is weird , because they 're the same age . Gary , listen , I will kill you , okay ? No , I 'll kill you first . I get up at 7 : 42 . Gary . What happened last night was--was very , very wrong on probably every level . Sheer incompetence or something worse . Yeah , it was the government . They killed him . That 's what they do . They 're jerk-asses . Dr. Rosen , I told you , I tried to warn you , when they stole my pudding . Well , be that as it may , Gary , we are going to continue to work with Mr. Cley , and his tactical agents , and his group of analysts . But with one very important adjustment- - they will no longer be privy to any of the inner workings of this office . They may very well have killed ... our first concrete connection to Stanton Parish . Wait , are you saying that Stanton Parish is connected to Eli 's death ? Rachel , I don 't know , but I 'm not ruling anything out . But if he is , it has some very serious implications . Which means that the people in this room , and this includes Nina , are the only people that you can truly count on . From this moment on , you are to consider this as your only circle of trust . Sleep well , sweet angel . Shh , shh , shh . Thought I might find you here . 1920 Le Regle de jeu . Hmm , always the most expensive , right ? I hear you killed another Alpha . That 's not fair . Yeah , well , a lot of people like me die around you , but it 's never your fault . All right , so what 's going on with you , Nina ? Why haven 't you returned our calls ? I 'm done . - You 're what ? - I 'm done . So you can tell Rachel that she can have the Van Gogh . It 's pointless without the couch . And consider this my resignation letter . Oh , and , um ... FYI ... Hicks is nailing your daughter . Nina , it 's important for you to be among people you can trust when you 're like this . - Trust ? - Alone is not good- - Stop talking . Get this through your head . It 's over . I 'm gone . Excuse me , sir . I 'm sorry , we 're closing . = = sync , corrected by elderman = =

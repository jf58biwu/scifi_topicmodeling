 Subtitle and sync : infotech It 's always the punch , you don 't see coming that put you down . But why didn 't I see it ? Of course they tried to kill me . Death is what they do for a living . So the question is not what happened . The question is what happened to me ? Necromongers . Someone who put a crown on my head . Someone who put a noose around my neck . Okay , more nooses than crowns . Every Lord Marshal was supposed to take some big oath . One that I never really got around to . We can say it has created a little friction . I needed a way out . Some new place . Or maybe just an old one . Sometimes I think you never sleep , Lord Marshal . They won 't let you stand at the threshold of the Underverse without embracing the faith . That 's why they come after you these assassins . They think of you as something wrong , cursed , illegitimate . What are you gonna do when you 're born that way ? Do you think the guards are still there ? So what 's the best way to a man 's heart ? Between the fourth and fifth rib . That 's where I usually go . But put a twist at the end if you want to make sure . Hey , hey , easy . Time 's up . How did they get so close ? How 'd I let them blindside me like ... Like that ? I said between the fourth and fifth . That was the fifth and sixth , body cavity . More like that . But who put her up to it ? Which commander ? It could be any . I don 't doubt for a second . Commander Vaako . Lord Marshal . Making more friends , I see . What do you want ? The crown ? Transcendence . Transcendence . I guess that was Necro-speak for " Get the fuck off this ship and make it forever . " Somewhere along the way I lost a step , got sloppy , dulled my own edge . Maybe I went and did the worst crime of all . I got civilized . So now , we zero the clock . Gotta find that animal side again . Subtitle : infotech

A 16-amp three-phase installation , at most one per phase and no branches . It will take hours . Take this one first . - No , leave me alone . Please . - Keep quiet . Mimi . Let her go ! Mimi ! Mimi ! REAL HUMANS - Shall I flip it now ? - Not yet , honey . Dad , can you help me with the math . Sure , I won 't do your homework , but I can give you some hints . The variable must be negative and " x " can 't equal the root of " y " . Well , it 's like this ... Eh ... - Work on it and I 'm sure you 'll get it . - But you know this . Don 't you ? A slow pace for 5 minutes . I 'll be home in an hour . - Well done . - Thanks . You 're welcome . - We increase to 9 mph for one minute . - Hello . - Could you do the shopping so I can rest ? - Sure . - Good . Not marmelade . Jam . Raspberry . - Raspberry jam ? I 'll write that down . - Not marmelade ? - No , jam . - Good morning , Odi . - Hello , Mathilda . How are you ? - I 'm good . How 's grand dad ? - A bit tired . But he 's fine . - Okay . See you , Odi . - Very probable . You will have to come with us . Shit ... - Isn 't it down by the ass ? - Is it that old ? - Crashed . We 'll have to turn it in . - I know who it belongs to . - Can I flip it over now ? - No , no , no . Let daddy do it , honey . - Hans Engman . - Hello . It 's me . You have to come to the store . Odi has broken . If you don 't pick him up , he may be trashed . Get it ? - If you ... - I 'm working . Mom just got in , talk to her . It 's Mathilda . Something happened to your daddy 's hubot . - It 's burning ! - Back away . I 'm on my way . - Oh . - No problems . - I have to go and sort this out . - It 's under control . - We should get a hubot , too . - We 'll never get one of those . What do you say ? Pick up a pizza ? - And you 've serviced him ? - Yes , and never a problem . And the inspection ? - What did they say at the inspection ? - They may have said I shouldn 't use him . That you mustn 't use him ? Don 't say you let Odi drive you here . - You let Odi drive the car ? - Odi 's an excellent driver . - It could have killed someone . - " It " ? - Odi would never ... - Dad , Odi 's not human , it 's a machine . Is it yours ? - It is ... Odi . - Has it really passed inspection ? Odi ? - You need to reboot it . - I 've never had to do that before . That one 's dangerous , believe me . - You have to recycle it . - Odi . His name is Odi . - Right away . - All right . I will . - Do you want me to come with you ? - No , thank you . You go home . Okay . Drive carefully . - You took it out ? - Yes , and buried . Good . Destroy it . Done . What about them ? - Sorry about Mimi , but we need to leave . - On my way . If we leave them tied up , they 'll die . If not , they 'll call the cops . I don 't know . - This was your idea . - We had no choice . I suggest you take the others to the lake , I 'll wait , release them , then look you up . - I 'm not coming . - What ? - I have to find Mimi . - No , Leo . - I have to find her . - We said we 'd stick together . - Or you 'll never find her . - I will find her . You risk our future and what your father dreamed of and worked for . - You let yourself be ruled by emotions . - Things you wouldn 't understand . - I 'm sorry ... - I need you , Leo . We need you . One of these days you will need me too . Don 't forget that . I 'll take Max . You go to the church . It 's a hike but the priest , she 'll help . Wait for me , I 'll be back with Mimi . Max . You 're with me . Get in the car . - Fred . Take the others to the lake . - And you ? - Just do as I say . - Okay . Let 's go . - But ... - Now . - He 's not on , is he ? - Luther . Don 't worry , he 's nice . As long as you are . I 'm a nice guy . Stolen ? No , but tampered with , so we 'll have to deal with that . - I think it 's chinese . - Korean . Not distributed in europe . - Is it a homebrew ? - It 's in good shape . - I have to re-install everything . - You always have to , anyway . - What 's that ? - Some trademark thing . Hair 's pretty worn ... I 'll sell it on the street . You can always sleep with it . Had it been a good brand ... I don 't bullshit you , guys . Damage will cost me $ 2000 . Hardware will be 4 grand and the work , at least 3 grand . $ 7000 . If I 'm really nice I could take it for 4 . Okay , $ 6000 . - It 's a deal ? - Okay . We have to ditch the car . It could be reported stolen . Max , listen . If anyone asks you , I 'm your owner . But don 't let them check it out . You 're not free like Mimi and the others . But still illegal . If the cops find you , they 'll destroy you . How can I be free ? One day I 'll help you be free . I promise . But I can 't do it on my own . What is it ? Nothing . Let 's go . - His only company is a robot . - But it 's not like that . You know how much he liked the one he had . - It 's still a machine . - You didn 't even like the coffee machine . Very funny . You have technofobia . You compare a coffee machine to something that takes care of dad . Are you one of those " Real Humans " all of the sudden ? Can 't I have an opinion before I 'm lumped up with those people ? I was joking . I get it . I 'm just trying to be modern and without prejudice here . And maybe realistic , too . What would it cost to work part time to be able to help your father ? - He can live here . - No ... No . - We have room . - No , he can 't ... Honey ... A new hubot is the only reasonable thing . It feels so cheap to do that to him . That 's just your conscience . It seems okay by him . - Mathilda says that Odi is dead . - No , he 's not dead , honey . - What does she mean , then ? - Odi is broken . That can happen . Sometimes things break . - But then you can fix them . - Not always . Not this time , honey . - Nice , isn 't it ? Came this morning . - I see ... Roger , why don 't you punch out ? We 'll manage . You can go home . Yeah , okay . Fine . - What kind of coffee do you want ? - You drink coffee ? What kind of coffee do you want ? Just black , please . Then you press here . Here . Here . - Enjoy . - Nice to see you 're good for something . Holy crap ... Hello ? Hello ? - Hey . - Hey . You 're home early . - You want me to throw the box away ? - No , me and Rick will do it . - It 's been two weeks now . - Now we move to side cruches . - Hey . - Hey . Did you buy me a new cell phone ? - What did I say this morning ? - That you would . When I get my salary . Or ask mom , if she 's got any money left from the inheritance . Check it out , Tobbe . - Hello . You can be with me if you want . - Sorry . - What do you think ? - Well ... - Excuse me . You work here ? - Sure . Are these any good ? If you want a model to clean , do the dishes and no hassle , sure . Shopping , cooking , driving ? Microwave dinners , sure . Lamb casserole and driving , no . But they do have electric outlets . A nice little feature . Oh ? - You can charge your cell phone , or ... - Oh ... Clever . - It 's for my father in law . - It must be able to drive a car . I agree . Follow me . This model is specifically designed for senior citizens . Oh , expensive ... - She can drive a car ? - She can drive 18-wheelers . - What ? - She could drive 18-wheelers . - It was just for a car ... - She also does heavy lifting , voice adjusted for hearing impaired , does CPR and medical procedures , and this hubot is an excellent " companion " . For the lonely nights . I 'll look around . - The price includes programming . - All the software ? What do you think ? As long as it can do what Odi could . I 'll just go and get some coffee . But , Lennart , don 't you ... I have a grandpa myself who 's getting a bit ... But the children all saved up and got him this very model . - This one , and it workes out ? - Oh , yes . There 's a 3 month wait on these , but we just got a cancellation . - Should I hold it for you ? - We 're moving a bit too fast here . The cancelled geriatric-hubb , what 's the status on that one ? Okay . Will you hold it for me ? - I 'm sure it 's everything you say ... - Coffee ? - Milk ? Sugar ? - Just sugar , please . - You don 't have one yourself ? - No . - You quickly get comfortable with them . - I understand that . But you have to remember that they 're still just machines . Considered getting one for the family ? - No . But now it 's about my father in law . - Exactly . I want to go home and think this over . Okay . But what if I throw in another hubot ? Free of charge . - Another one ? - How about that ? Go and open the door . Hey . - Tobbe , this is expensive stuff . - It 's heavy . Back up and mind the step . - Shit , we have a hubot ! - I haven 't told mom , yet ... It looks great . - Is it real ? - It 's a hubot , honey . - A real one ? - Yes , a real one . - How do you turn it on ? - Easy now ... Don 't touch . Let daddy look at this . I will start it up in demo mode . There , somewhere ... Hello . - Hello . - Hello . - What the hell is that ? - Don 't yell ... What 's her name ? We will pick a name for her . - Mom 's gonna freak out ... - Everyone 's got one . - Not everyone . - Many do . - Everyone 's has one . - Not everyone . Hello . Hello . What 's your name ? I don 't have a name yet . You have to install ... Reconfigure in name mode ... - Hey . - Hey . So how did it go today ? What 's it doing here ? We were getting one for your dad , after Odi , and we got this for free . - It would be insane to refuse . - The garage ... - It can shop , clean ... - I know what they can do . - I wasn 't born yesterday . - It does homework ... That 's it . I want my kids to remember the humans who cared for them . Who helped them with homework and picked them up after school . And we could get more time for that , if she helps out around the house . I don 't know about you , but I feel I don 't have enought time for the kids , us and myself too . For you , honey . Can 't you see the benefits ? Tobias and his buddies , what do you think they get up to when they 're alone ? My God , don 't you read ? People use them as sex toys . - He 's 15 . - He would never ... I see what he 's thinking . I see straight through that kid . - Does it do that ? Does it have sex ? - It 's a family model . It cooks . Do you know what services it provides ? You have to check that out . And you have to talk to Tobias . And get it to change clothes . Then we try for two weeks . After that , I decide if we keep it . - Deal ? - Yes , fine . Damn ... I can check your computer after the game . - My computer ? - It was broken ? The hubb and I have already fixed it . Thanks anyway . - I wanna see the game . - Me and Rick follow this show . - For real ... - Please . You always watch TV . - I didn 't follow ... - It 's not who she thinks it is , - - It 's the other one . - I see ... My God . She doesn 't know yet . Let me help you . What the hell ... You fucking retard ! I 've had enough of you ! - You bloody idiot ! - Stop it ! Dammit ... Take the damn thing to the dump . Rick . Rick ! CONNECT YOUR HUBOT Let 's see .. I did ... That one . There . Let 's see . Name . Hello Anita . Hello . - What 's your name ? - My name is Anita . - What 's your name ? - Tobias . Or " Tobbe " . - Tobbe is your nick name ? - Exactly . - Tobbe . Isn 't it time for bed ? - No . I want to see this . But really . It 's late and time for bed . And Tobbe . This hubb , Anita , is no plaything , okay ? What do you mean ? Well ... eh ... that you don 't do anything foolish with her . - Please ... - You know what I mean . Sleep well , Tobbe . Good night . Sleep well , buddy . I 'm sure there was more of them . Thank you . - Could you show me the dirty laundry ? - I 'll take care of that myself . - Good morning , honey . - Good morning . - Did you sleep well ? - Could I have the blue spoon ? - Then you can scratch my back . - Sofia . They do that . Alice has a hubot too . Thank you . Higher ... - Someone 's birthday ? - I don 't think so . - Good morning . Sleep well ? - I guess ... Whoops . - Good morning . Sleep well ? - Mmm . - Two weeks . - Absolutely . Looks to be quite the ordeal . - You 're not supposed to be here now . - Have to charge . - At this hour ? - Have to charge . - You charge between 8 and 10 pm . - Have to charge now . So you say , but you haven 't answered my question . - You haven 't asked me anything . - Yes , I did , idiot . - Why don 't you charge at night ? - There was a power outage . Now the bastards lie too ... It hasn 't been any bloody outage . Have to charge . Have to charge . Have to charge . Bloody idi ... - Are you alone here ? - They all had to charge . I 'll stop the machine . Take a break . Thank you . Tired of this shit ... How can i guarantee delivery if they all have to charge during rush hour ? They 're not only stupid . They break and they can 't answer simple questions . Fucking tired of these dummies , they 're everywhere . - And they lie . Blaming a power outage . - We had to cut the power for three hours . - You could have told me . - Didn 't they just tell you ? The fact is that the margin for error has gone down from 10 % to nearly nothing . And the humans , still on the line has an error average of 11 % . But that 's ... And I think they 're kinda cute . I need your credit card to purchase cleaners and food . - You buy what I tell you to . - I 'm here for your well being . Where 's the coffee ? - You have hypertension . - How do you know ? I checked while you were sleeping . - You get a cup of tea . - I want my coffee . It 's not good for you . I want coffee , and I want to be left alone in the kitchen . Try not to get agitated , remember the hypertension . Bitch ... Enjoy . There 's nothing we can do here . We need to get him to a shop . He 's gone . If we keep this up , we 'll all be gone soon . - Keep this up , how ? - Wander about . - We 're going to the church . - That 's days away , on foot . Better start walking , then . - Hello ? - Coming . - Yes ? - A room , please . - So I can 't take it in the room ? - Why the hell would you want to ? We 've had too much trouble with " foulhubs " . The police hassle us . He 's okay . Tell you what , if you have the papers , I 'll make an exception . Look at this . Put it down . Thank you . 95 % of these , unregistered , stolen , end up as sex-hubs . Probably with some old guy right now , and you 'll never see it again . - Do you know the traders around here ? - No idea . I don 't do that . I really need to find her . Buy a new one , or rent one of these . - Do you know " Hubot Heaven " ? - No . The center for all hub sex trading . Those who snatched your doll , surely have some connection there . Have a cap . HUBOT HEAVEN Anita . Could you ... Carry on . I 'll take care of it . - Therese . - I was about to call you . - What 's this ? - Me , Rick and Kevin are moving out . We borrowed an apartment , I just wanted you to have my new number . Goodbye , Roger . Thank you for these years . But I can 't live like this anymore . REAL HUMANS Leave the dishes on the table , Lennart . And don 't forget to take your pills . - Lennart . - I 'm building scale models . Odi ? Hello .

 THE 4 SOLDIERS The war began when few rich people remained . All the rest were poor . The army fought for the rich . With nothing left to lose , the poor formed their own militias . I was living with my parents when the fighting began . They were killed early on , trying to protect me . I stayed in the house , alone in my room ... with them . All alone , for several days ... before joining a battalion . We fought often . We would win , we would lose , without really knowing why . Hurry up , damn it ! We 're going to miss the party ! Come on , move it ! The war had become a habit . It seemed unlikely to change ... up until ... Up until I met Mateo . Let 's take the house . Look at this ! This guy 's messed up ! Mateo was everything that I 'm not . And it was at that exact moment that I began to wonder if that was why I had followed him . Come on ! And I still wonder . This is really cool , you 'll see . And it 's not complicated . Things were all right here , once . They had gas and electricity . And nice floors ! These are some high-end products . Luxury . This is where they must have had their hot meals . Hello ! Hello ! You guys look comfortable here . So that 's what I smelled earlier ! I was right to come here ... Maybe they 'll give me some . They just might ! That 's some good grub ! Do you have anything to smoke ? Take this . - What 's your name ? - Big Max . - Big Mac ! - No ! Not like the burger , like Maximilian . But Big Max is better than Maximilian , because Maximilian is a little ... - A little ... - A little gay ? Yeah , good night . Good night . The room was nothing like my old room at my parents , and yet it felt very familiar . Painful memories came back to haunt me . Thankfully , there was another room . Good night , boys ! By forcing me to sleep there , Max made me relive my parents death once and for all , and see them again , before the war , when they were alive and well . You 're not eating ? Do you want to stay with us ? Fear came back in an instant , but it was different than before . For the first time since ... For the first time , I wasn 't only afraid for myself . By midwinter , we were losing more often . We had to retreat to the countryside . The battalion 's morale sank ... but ours stayed strong . It was easier together . Hello , everyone . The Committee has decided that it 's time to recruit . For now , the orders are to wait . That 's it . Your unit leaders will let you know when the situation changes . See you later . Hang in there ! " Hang in there ! " What does it look like we 're doing ? It 'd be so cool if they stationed us here ! - Really ? - Shit , yeah ! With all the material out here , we could finally build a real cabin ! What ? We 're going to build a cabin with a truck for a living room ! And a car for a kitchen ! And the bedroom will be a ... What kind of car will the bedroom be , Max ? - What kind of car ? - The bedroom ... All right , everybody , we 're setting up camp here . Where did that big slacker go ? We 'll never finish before nightfall . Not if it 's just the two of us . We need to find help , or else we 're in deep shit . - Oh yeah ? - Yeah . Pretty much everyone has grouped off already . The guy with the dreads over there , that 's Kevin , right ? - Do you know him ? - Yeah . He 's a great shot . I 've never heard anyone complain about him . - Have you seen Max ? - No . Check it out ! It 's not a car , but could we use it as a bedroom ? Yeah ! Not bad , Max ! Do you think there 's enough room for him too ? There 's room for two of him ! When we finished building the cabin , all we could think of was Kevin . But we weren 't worried . Not at all . There had to be four of us , and he was the fourth . Hello , my love ! Happy birthday ! I have a little present for you . Not bad , eh ? - You want it , don 't you ? - Yeah ! - Yeah ! - Too bad . It 's mine ! I 'm the one who found it ! When the four of us went to bed that night , I thought : " This is it . I 'm done with being alone . " I told myself ... Rather , I told my parents : " Don 't worry about me , I have friends , now . " It was a long , cold winter , but our cabin held up , and so did we . We were together all the time . Not once did we get on each other 's nerves . Not once were we bored . Don 't you think you should save that gas ? - What is it ? - It smells . - Like what ? - Like water . The pond was like a gift that the war had given us . We accepted it without feeling guilty , because we deserved it . I had never felt time pass the way it did that day . I thanked the pond for appearing to us . This isn 't going to work . That pond is ours . No one else can find it . Let 's not carve out a trail . We 'll split up , OK ? Max , go that way . Dominique , Kevin ... I 'm going this way . - Whose turn is it ? - Mine ! Hang on , let 's give Kevin a chance . You want it , Kevin ? - No . - He doesn 't want it . It 's mine ! Wait ! Why don 't you want it ? Do you have a problem with girls , Kevin ? Maybe he just doesn 't like girls . Maybe he 's never ... Good night . Good night , guys . You like that , eh , big guy ? Unlike Kev ! Come with me . Where are you going ? Go back to sleep , it 's all right . I had a dream . What kind of dream ? I dreamed about Kevin . I dreamed that he slit my throat . He slit your throat ? - How ... - Jesus , he slit my throat ! With a knife ! It 's not complicated ! Do you need me to paint a picture ? He slit my throat ! - Where did it happen ? - In the cabin . Two slashes in a row , from behind . Kevin isn 't ... He couldn 't do that . Well , in my dream ... Had he stayed a minute longer , I 'd have known what to say to him . Or maybe not . OK , kids ! It 's requisition day ! It 's your turn ! Move it , if you want to eat at noon . Come on , get dressed . Let 's go ! I 'll wait for you outside ! Hurry up ! Come on , Big Max . Wake up . He was scared last night . It didn 't show . It was probably better that the others didn 't know . I was sort of proud to be the only one to know about his nightmare . - What ? - Nothing . That 's it , lard-ass ! That 's it ! Right , Big Max ? This way , lard-ass ! Over here ! Come on , my dear lard-ass ! Move ! Where are you , lard-ass ? Yo , Dominique ! Over here ! Yeah ! You OK ? It 's going to feel like you 're swimming , but you 're in no danger . Go ! - You all right ? - Yeah ! You OK ? You 're really good ! OK , again ! - No , no ! - Yeah ! Move your arms ! And just like that , the pond became part of our cabin , like another room ; the main room , actually , where the war didn 't exist , and where we could enjoy what was developing between us . Mateo ... Let 's just say it 's my turn , OK ? Is this what you want ? Have fun ! Hello , my love ! Happy birthday ! I have a little present for you . She 'd never do that again if she could see you now , Big Max ! I 'll trade you a joint for it . - Two . - One . Max ! Don 't you owe me a joint ? Thank you ! Whose turn will it be tomorrow ? Mine , if Kevin doesn 't want it . Damn it ! It was a good idea to wash them . It was a good idea , like all our other ideas ... Family first . Here . Thanks . I was relieved for a while . I was his friend , and I was there for him . I was a friend he could wake up in the middle of the night . Then , all of a sudden , I started thinking ... What if it were me in his dream , instead of Kevin ? Get up , kids ! Get up ! We did our chores ! Can 't you just let us be ? Get up ! This isn 't a chore , it 's something else . - Like ? - Teamwork . A special mission for you guys . You 're going to take him in and show him the ropes . His name 's Gabriel Tardif , right ? Gabriel Tardif . No . Find another group or take him back to his mom , where he should be . I 'm not here for your opinion . It 's an order . You 'll be happy to have him by your side when the shit hits the fan . And believe me , that day 's coming sooner than you think ! - Teach him ... - We 're not teaching him anything ! We don 't want him and we don 't have enough room . We 're breaking camp soon , so hurry up and show him the ropes ! Go get breakfast . You don 't want him to see the pond ? If we leave here soon , we 'll never go back there at all . We left for the pond , thinking we 'd lose Gabriel along the way . He didn 't know the camp , and we were sure he 'd get sidetracked along the way . And it almost worked . We took him along with us , far from the pond . Come on , get the dice out ! You want to lose , lard-ass ? I 'm going to cream you ! I 'm going to win that pot back , Kev ! Where 'd the kid go ? - He 's writing . - Writing what ? Write that Big Max is nothing but a big lard-ass ! No ! Don 't write that ! Write that I 'm going to beat Mateo at dice and ... Come on ! It 's my turn ! I 'm going to roll until I get more points than him ! - Write that Big Max is a cheater ! - No , don 't write that ! What are you doing ? Show me what you 've got , boy ! Give him a shot to the ribs ! Now you can write it . It 's true , I am a cheater ! It 's your turn . Nothing . Your turn . Did you write what I told you about that lard-ass ? I 'm talking to you ! Did you write what I said about him ? Instead of writing about how Max cheated , I wished that Gabriel could 've written about the rain on the pond . Even if it meant getting soaked to the bone . Write that he 's making our ears bleed , too . - Are you guys talking about me ? - No , no . Quit messing with me . I heard you ! What 'd you say ? Watch the road when you 're driving , will you ? Copy that , 10-4 . On the way back , I prayed for my parents to help us . Specifically , to help Mateo solve the problem of Gabriel and the pond . I prayed to them harder than I 'd ever prayed to them before . Afer that , Gabriel settled into our room without any problems . But the iPod ... It was too early for that . Mateo ... What ? Nothing ... It 's silly . I 'd love to hear something silly . Go ahead . It 's way too silly . Even better . In your dream , is it always Kevin who ... Yeah . If it was me instead of Kevin , in your dream , who was ... How would we get past that ? Afer all we 'd been through , I would 've liked him to yell at me for having dared to think of taking Kevin 's place in his nightmare . But ... I don 't know . I don 't know what we 'd do . For the first time since we 'd all gotten together , I woke up alone . And I started thinking . I just couldn 't help it . I thought something terrible had happened . But everything was calm . There was nothing unusual . But I was sure that something terrible had happened ... or was going to happen . Are we leaving ? You 're going to be blown away ! He 's never seen it ! Do it for him ! - He doesn 't care ! - No , he 'll write all about it ! Come on , Kev , you can do it ! I 'm sure you can ! All right , all right ... - You ready ? - Yeah . Jesus ! I knew it ! I knew it , man ! With your eyes covered , too ! That was nice ! That was nice ? Was that nice , Dom ? Did you see that ? Holy shit , he 's fast ! And with his eyes covered ! Enjoy it while you can . Our time here is almost up . We 're leaving tomorrow night . The news that we were leaving lef us feeling empty . We walked for hours without going anywhere . We were all thinking about the pond , but no one wanted to go , for fear that it might be just as sad as we were . So you 're writing to your mom ? Who are you writing to , then ? I 'm not writing to anyone . You guys didn 't hit a single bird ? We were unlucky . - Happy , now ? - Yeah ! - You look like a cowboy ! - No , I 'm an Indian ! OK , Indian , it 's Kevin 's turn ! - No , a little longer . - Everybody gets a turn ! OK . Stop , horse . - You want to get on ? - Yeah . I 'm a good rider , eh , Mateo ? You 're a good rider , Big Max ! He likes you . He 's walking sideways . Kevin 's smile , the horse walking calmly behind Max , Mateo and Gabriel walking side by side ... everyone was exactly where they belonged . He 's my friend ! It was like the horse was leading us away from the war ... forever . OK , let 's switch ! Who 's up ? - Dominique , you want to ride ? - Yes ! Come , I 'll help you up ! - OK , lift ! - 1 , 2 , 3 , go ! I don 't think you can have your turn . It 's no one 's fault . Our time with the horse helped take our minds off the war . We went back to the pond without feeling bad . Nothing better than pork ! And nothing more annoying . - Annoying ? - Yeah . Especially when the porker plays dice ! It 'll attract fish . You can 't be writing to no one . Who are you writing to ? Myself . Yourself ? What are you writing ? Yesterday , he wrote that I won at dice ! Look after your fish , lard-ass ! What are you writing ? Well ... I write about what I see . But not everything you see . Give me an example . Guys , I 've got one ! I knew it ! It 's awesome ! It 's beautiful ! Come see , Kev ! Look at this ! - Not bad , Big Max ! - Not bad ! Not bad at all ! The pond 's effect wore off as soon as we got back to camp , and the next day 's departure took up all the time we had left . I ate pig and fish in the same day , so now , in my stomach , there 's a pig with fins , and it tickles ! It was a good thing Max was there . Here . Why don 't I ever get it ? OK , give her a little kiss before bedtime . What is that ? - Hey ! - No ! - Give it ! - A little longer ! Your turn 's coming . What did you write today ? I wrote that you shot at some birds , but didn 't bring a single one down . That 's true . Did you write that we stole a horse ? Yeah . That 's good . You shouldn 't tell lies . I said that it ran away before everyone had a turn . Did you write about Kevin taking his rifle apart with his eyes closed ? You should have . Wouldn 't you like it if he wrote about that , Kevin ? Yeah , I don 't know . - You wouldn 't have liked it ? - Honestly , I would have . You see ? He wants you to write about it . So you 'll write about it , OK ? At the end , I wrote that we still had a good day . And it was true . My God , was it true . The next day , we got up and left early , without eating . We were in a hurry to have one last day of relaxation , far from the war . Let 's get it out of there ! On " go " ! 1 , 2 , 3 , go ! Come on , Max ! What are you doing ? Is there a problem ? Are you afraid of a dead horse ? Is that it , you 're afraid ? You 're afraid of the dead horse ? Say something ! You 're afraid of dead horses ! That 's not so hard to say , is it ? You 're afraid because you 've never seen one before . He 's never seen one . He 's never seen one , and neither have you . You haven 't either , right ? You haven 't , and neither have I ! You see horses all the time , huh ? You see horses , and they 're always alive ! But where do they bury all the dead horses ? Where the hell are they ? We can 't know where they are , Mateo , because no one knows . Once again , I couldn 't say what he needed to hear . I let the pond do it for me . I told myself : " The pond will make him forget about the night to come . " It had never been so calm or so pretty ... and that 's how Gabriel would describe it , I was sure . And I looked at the spot where the horse had died , knowing that , like it or not , it would also end up in his book . We 'll stay here ! What do you think ? They can eat shit ! Let them find other idiots to march all night in the cold ! - Really ? - Yeah . Tonight and every other night . We like it here ! Right , Max ? No doubt ! We should stay here instead and eat fish ! - Those fish aren 't very big ! - They 'll grow ! Yeah ! If there are small ones , that means there are big ones ! There 's corn everywhere . We have everything we need here . What do you think ? What do I think ... We have the Winnebago for when it rains . We have our weapons . We can do some requisitioning if we want . We don 't need them ! We don 't need anyone ! They don 't know we 're here ! Not a soul knows where we are ! Before they shoot us , they 'll have to find us first . Guys , I got one ! Come see ! Not bad , huh ? Let 's cook it up before we go back to camp , OK ? OK , Max . Let 's do that . Don 't forget to put this in your journal , OK ? What is it ? It 's too small , is that it ? Yeah , it 's too small . Making a big fire , washing our coats , being surprised by how different we all are , yet how perfect we are for each other . With each step , I wished we could have one more day at the pond . Then , I had the urge to hold them in my arms , one after the other . That 's how scared we were , how lost we were , how sad we were . But I held back so we wouldn 't be laughed at . Now , I regret not having done it ... because it makes me even sadder . - We 're stopping , boys ! - Stop ! Guys ! I 'm over here ! Dominique ! - We 're here , Max ! - Mateo ? Hello ! Hey , Kev ! Gabriel ! Let 's make a fire ! You OK , kid ? Let it out . Where 's the iPod ? Kiss it . You too , go ahead . Come on ! Have some more . Come on ! Wake up , on your feet ! - Come on , up ! - We 're leaving in five minutes ! It 's time ! We 're leaving in five minutes ! It 's coming from over there ! Quick , hide ! I can 't see them ! They 're waiting for us to move so they can fire at us . Easy ! It 's going to be all right . It 'll be OK . Max , take the kid and go hide behind the container . Go ! It 'll be all right , Kevin . Close your eyes ! Close your eyes , Kevin . Easy , it 'll be all right . Knock it off , Max . Stop it , Max ! Shut up , lard-ass ! When I realized that Gabriel was only pretending to write , I was angry at first ... that he had betrayed us . But when I understood that he did it so that we 'd keep him around ... I thought that he was right to want to stay with us ... that we were worth the trouble . Then , I figured that our story had to be written down ... before it ceased to exist . Now , I 've written everything I can about us . Everything Gabriel should 've written . It 's impossible for me to continue ... because there 's no way to know if there 's another smile like Kevin 's out there . Or to know what 's left of Gabriel . Or what Mateo and Max are doing today . The future has no end . But I have to stop ... because I 'm tired . - Where 's the iPod ? - It 's here . Come and get it .

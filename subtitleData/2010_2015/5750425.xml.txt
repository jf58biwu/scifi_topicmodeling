 Previously , on Warehouse 13 ... Whatever the effects of the astrolabe , I 'm afraid it 's caused Arthur to have some sort of psychotic break . Artie killed Leena . He 's been whammied , just like we 've all been whammied at some point . We 're reinstating you as soon as possible . We see no need for punishment at this juncture . You can 't be serious . She died by my hand . And you will have to live with that . How many errant static-electricity balls are there ? Here comes another one ! Bring it , electric boogaloo . Whoa ! Okay , drop it on the battery . Ha ha ha ! Score one for some Indian dude whose name I can 't even pronounce . Okay , Vyasa wasn 't some dude . - He was the author of the Vedas . - Yeah . The oldest sacred text ever written , - the basis of Hinduism . - Never read ' em . I 'm waiting for the Bollywood version . Now , how many mo sparkles we got left ? You know what ? Don 't ask me questions that you don 't want to know the answer to , okay ? Pete ? Hope this bad boy can handle four at once . - Good job . - Whoa . Whoa . I don 't think that bad boy does four . This is not my fault ! We can talk about blame later . You 're so gonna blame me . Myka , you 're in black and white . - You 're in black and white . - I am not ! Aah ! I 'm in black and white ! Oh , my God , our clothes , our clothes , they 're like- - It 's like 1940s . Oh , come on , not time travel again ! No , no , it 's not time travel . The 1940s were in color , much like the rest of history . All right , then where are we ? I don 't know . Okay , it 's Chicago in olden times . Okay , okay , uh , focus . Uh , retrace the steps . Right , I had the--the elephant . It shot lightning up into the stacks . Right , and then it was raining manuscript pages . Manuscript pages . All those pages were blank . Not all of them- - look . Okay , I 'm gonna go with , " No , that is not a good title . " I loved Anthony Bishop . He was a ' 40s crime novelist , hard-boiled . I read every single one of his books when I was a kid . Okay , so did you read Kiss Me , Forever ? No , that was his last one . I don 't--I don 't think he ever finished it . That would explain the blank pages . Well , he went insane from writer 's block and then ... killed himself . Turning the manuscript into an artifact . Swell . Are you sure this is a good idea ? He 's been at that piano for days . It 's not healthy . Also , I 'm sick of that tune . It 's gonna be hard to trick Artie . Please , I always got the lead at the psychodramas at the institution . Action . I 'm telling you , it 's a ping . And I 'm telling you , it 's a burglary . Classic cars are vanishing from locked garages without a trace . â™ª Burglary This one guy had a ' 52 Desoto on display in his living room like a trophy . Now , a burglar would have had to take it apart piece by piece to get it out . If something was hinky , I 'm sure Artie would know . He 's the ping king . Isn 't that right , Your Majesty ? It 's probably worth checking out . Don 't forget your neutralizer . Meh . Sounds like a waste of time . Ow . Yeah , I mean , the car was found with clean vin numbers at a dealer in Sioux Falls . There 's lots of ' 52 Desotos . Yeah , but this one had a ' 53 hood emblem . Makes it one of a kind . It 's not one of a kind . It 's flawed . If the cars are literally vanishing , it is an artifact . File . Clearly I stand corrected . Oh , mark the date . Keep your Farnsworth handy in case I need research when I 'm in the field . What ? Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . You 're going without us ? I can handle a simple snag-and-bag . Yes , of course you can , but we should go with you . Why ? Uh ... W-we 'd miss you ? We 'd miss a chance to learn from the master . The ping king . Also , safety in numbers . Doesn 't he always say safety first ? I-I 've heard him say that , yes . We want to see the cool hot rods . Yeah , a-all right . We 'll take Scarlett . What , you named your new car ? You wear torn clothing . We all have our quirks . So how 's my acting ? I 'm not gonna lie to you . Any luck ? I must 've run for ten blocks . The black and white goes on forever . And everything smells like fudge . What 's our next move ? Pete . I know my next move . I hear you 're the best in town . I like what you hear . Please , I didn 't know where else to turn . My husband has disappeared , and I think it has something to do with this . Look what else made the trip . Resync for WEB-DL by lost0ne 4x13 The Big Snag So , Miss ... ? Carson . Mrs. Rebecca Carson . Mrs. Carson , how can we help you ? Thank you . You 're very kind . I would love a cup of joe . Sorry ? I think Mrs. Carson would like you , my secretary , to get her a cup of coffee . If it 's not too much trouble . Two sugars in mine , doll . Oh , I will put a little extra something in yours , doll . So your husband likes elephants ? Oliver was an archaeologist . He found this jade relic in India . He said it had magical powers . Hmm . Magical powers ? Yes . He was terrified it might end up in the wrong hands , and now he 's gone . And I 'm--I 'm just so- - I 'm frightened . - Well , I mean- - - Relax , toots . Lattimer here is the best shamus in town . Thank you . I 'm a what now ? Excuse us a sec , will you ? Uh-huh . Myka , how does someone else have our artifact ? I dropped it before we got sucked in here . Well , it must have gotten pulled in with us . And you and I fell into--into the roles of private detective and his gal Friday . - Secretary . - His gal Friday ! Or you consult this case by yourself while I make coffee . Our artifact is what this story is about . The case of the missing jade elephant . Exactly . Myka , if this manuscript got turned into an artifact because of bishop 's writer 's block ... And now we have a case to solve . Maybe the way to escape is to do what the writer couldn 't do . And finish the story . And if " finish the story " means " find an artifact , " then that 's good , because that 's what we do . Yeah , except we don 't have any of our tools here , okay ? We don 't have any goo . We don 't have a Tesla . We don 't have any Warehouse backup . Yeah , but we got one thing going for us . What 's that ? Nobody finds artifacts like we do , doll face . Lady ... You got yourself a gumshoe . Ferrari 430 convertible . Yeah , what 's that ? Lamborghini Countach . Yeah , and ... '67 Mustang Fastback . Yeah , this place is definitely moving cars . It 's nice . Commission chaser at 9 : 00 . Hi . I 'm Amy . So I see you 're looking at the Mustang here . You 've got a good eye . Well , it is a V-8- - We 're not here to buy . Sorry . Well , then you want to sell a car . Excellent , because we are always looking- - No , we 're not selling either . Oh , window shoppers . You know , I always say if you 're looking , you 're- - Just take us to the owner , please . Grand theft auto , fraud , aiding and abetting . You could do serious jail time . Or you could cooperate and tell us how you 're stealing cars from locked rooms . Of course . And you could cooperate by showing me your warrant . That 's really how you want to play this ? It really is . Fine . Artie , don 't ! What the hell is that thing ? Does your insurance cover " act of ray gun " ? 'Cause I 'm gonna shoot every car in here . He 's not lying . Whoa , okay , okay , okay . I 've got a guy . He gets me any car I need . It 's like magic . - What 's his name ? - I never met him . I wire money into a Cayman account with car requests . I 'm not giving you my password . Passwords just slow me down . What else can you tell us about this phantom thief ? Nothing . I get an anonymous email telling me where to pick up my car . Yeah , no help here . Stealy McThieferson is just sitting on his money . No way to track him until he makes a withdrawal . We 're gonna have to identify target cars in the area . Or we could get him to come to us tonight . - Mr. Lambeth . - Please don 't shoot my cars . No , no , no , no , we need you to make a request for a very specific car that 's only in town for tonight . Very good , Jinksy . Oh , Scarlett . The dame said the last place she saw her husband was his office . She may have said more , but I was too busy staring at her gams . The only thing stopping them going on forever was the floor . Pete , are you narrating ? No , I 'm just- - I 'm getting into character . When other people are around . Besides , this isn 't a cheesy movie . This is an Anthony Bishop novel . Hey , noir films are awesome . Yes , but Bishop 's novels are superb . They had an elegance , a beauty . Myka Ophelia Bering , are you actually enjoying this ? No , I had a dog . It doesn 't mean I want to be trapped in one . Hello , handsome . Pete , wake up . Pete ! This book hurts . Welcome to the Indigo Club ... My club . I must apologize for the manner in which you were escorted here . The boys can be a tad overzealous . Sure . Untie us , and we 'll call it Jake . Of course . After you tell me why you were at Mr. Carson 's office . We were looking for dope on who snatched him . I guess we found it . No , Pete , he 's looking for Carson too . Aren 't you , Mister ... ? Barnabas . Caspian Barnabas . You 're quite astute for a woman . I went to college . I bet you did . You 're after the jade elephant . Aren 't you ? There is such a thing as too smart . You want to know a secret ? I am awash with anticipation . Your goons went easy on me 'cause I 'm a dame . Mm-hmm . They should 've tied my ropes tighter . Now , untie him , you big Jasper . Jasper , ha ha ! Nice ! What 's it mean ? There 's been a terrible misunderstanding . Yeah , you misunderstood how kick-ass my partner can be . This club is , uh , merely a hobby . I am , by vocation , shall we say , a procurer of rare and valuable artifacts . Oh , yeah ? Us too . Excellent . Kindred spirits . I hired Mr. Carson to find the elephant . But alas , once found he decided to retain ownership . Why do you think that is ? What motivates any man ? Greed . I bet you know all about that . I paid him . That means I am the owner of the jade elephant and the wronged party in this sordid tale . Yeah , tell that to my aching jaw . Again , my sincere regrets . Here , a retainer to find my elephant . Oh , please , dude , we already have- - Eggs in the coffee , boss . Come on , this 'll be duck soup . You are enjoying this ! Carson may be our only lead , but this place has already been tossed . Barnabas ' goons must have missed something , otherwise he wouldn 't have hired us . Yeah , and you took his money . Why ? We 're gonna need something , some cash while we 're trapped in here and- - Kristieanne . What ? Is that like Jasper ? Anthony Bishop , the author- - his mother 's name was Kristieanne . Yeah , so ? So ... Oh , right , so the goons would never know that . It 's a plain old matchbook to them , an unintended clue for us . Mm-hmm . " You 're quite astute for a woman . " Ugh . I need your guest book and no questions . You got that , ace ? Pete , it 's the ' 40s . You could have bribed him with $ 5 . And I want change from that " C " note , see ? He 's not coming back , is he ? Someone 's erased an entry . - I think I got this one . - What ? Raymond St. James did it in Dark Memento . Augustus Pitt Rivers , 204 . That is a noir name if I ever heard one . Pete , Augustus Rivers is a real archaeologist . And our missing Mr. Carson is an archaeologist . He must be using rivers as his alias . That remind you of anything ? I 'd say there 's a jade elephant in the room . Pete ? The window . Carson ! Carson 's still got the elephant . I don 't think so . This is Oliver Carson , and he 's dead . All right , well , whoever killed Carson has the elephant . Either way , we don 't . Pete , this isn 't just a story about a missing relic . If Carson 's dead , we 're in a murder mystery . Great . Now we got to find the missing dingus and put the finger on whoever rubbed out Carson , or we 're locked up in crazy town forever . Why couldn 't we have fallen into a cookbook ? " Classic-car buff Artie Weisfelt " bids a fond farewell to this 1964 convertible " before it leaves for its new home- - Sinsheim , Germany 's auto technik museum . " Hey , some nice shades . They 're hiding his tears . This is great . Hotel 's name is clearly visible , so the thief will know exactly where to find it . Yeah , Lambeth sent this link with the money , so all we have to do is wait for the thief to show up . Okay . Oh , my God . Tell me you are not messing with one of my Tesla grenades . I 'm not messing . I 'm making some improvements so I can increase the blast radius . Okay , you know what ? First of all , you don 't improve perfection . You turn up the blast on this , and it goes from stun to fry . Yeah , well , I 'm not taking any chances . If we have- - And second , a subtler plan . Oh , you made a GPS tracking device . - Yes , I did . - It 's very impressive . - Thank you . - It says my car is in Spain . - What ? - Brilliant plan . Okay , your- - your little trick with the Tesla grenade must have bumped it to a different frequency . - This is my fault now ? - I forgive you . Nothing you can break that I can 't unbreak . Just let me know when you get the signal . All right . This is very cool . If Bishop couldn 't solve his own murder mystery , how are we supposed to ? No idea , but if we don 't , we 'll be trapped in black and white forever . Great . And I just got a good base tan . Any chance you want to tell Mrs. Carson her husband is dead ? Oh , I 'm just the secretary . Oh , fine . 'Cause blondes dig me . Maybe she 'll want me to console her . Please don 't . We need her to tell us something she may have forgotten , even if it 's insignificant . Can I help you ? Yeah , we 're working for Mrs. Rebecca Carson . Is she home ? I 'm sorry . Who are you ? Mrs. Carson hired us to find her husband . May we speak with her ? Is this a joke ? I 'm Rebecca Carson . I 'd say that 's significant . I never thought he 'd turn up at all . Yeah , and how 's that ? I assumed I 'd never see him again ... After he took all my money and ran off with that peroxide blonde . Can you tell us anything about her ? She has terrible taste in men . A name would be more helpful . All I know is he met the little round heels at the Indigo Club . Oh , that joint again . Say , Mykes ... When was the last time I took you dancing ? Thanks , pal . So it 's got to be the blonde , right ? She beat us to Carson , killed him , and took the artifact . Or she 's working for Barnabas . On the other hand , why would she hire us to solve a crime that she committed ? It 's a good plot device . Pete ... Someone 's not happy to see us . Nobody 's been happy to see us . The ' 40s were rude . â™ª My darling â™ª after you 've gone â™ª and left me crying Well , surprise , surprise . â™ª There 's no denying â™ª you 'll feel blue â™ª you 'll feel sad â™ª you 'll miss the bestest pal you ever had â™ª Yowza . Talk about a triple threat . We 'll grab her after the song . Yeah , yeah , we 'll , uh- - we 'll blend ... Keep a low profile . This is keeping a low profile ? Well , everyone 's either dancing or drinking , and drinking isn 't an option . â™ª Your heart will break like mine , and you 'll want me â™ª â™ª only after you 've gone Detective Lattimer , you cut a rug . Even though I 'm incredibly manly , that doesn 't mean I ain 't got no rhythm . â™ª After you 've gone 6 : 00 . â™ª You 're gonna miss me baby â™ª If he killed Carson , he 's one cool customer . â™ª Maybe someday ... Yeah , and the hooch-slinger with the evil eye has lost interest in us . â™ª Your heart will break like mine â™ª That canary--that 's one dame we know for sure ain 't on the square . â™ª After you 've gone Hands . Sorry , Mykes . It 's a force of habit . â™ª Gone away - She 's made us . - Yeah . And instead of going for an encore , it looks like she 's going for a powder . Let 's go . Good evening , Mrs. Carson . Yes , I lied . If I 'd have told you the truth , you wouldn 't have helped me . Now we 'll never know , will we ? Now , what 's your real name ? Lily . Lily Abbott . Please , I wasn 't trying to- - Cut to the chase , Lil . You admit to killing Carson , tell us where the elephant is , we 'll make sure you don 't get the chair . But I didn 't kill Carson . I was here rehearsing . It 's time to start singing , sister , and I don 't mean no love song . I never meant for any of this to happen . I 'm not a bad girl . That 's a baloney sandwich , and you know it . Let me guess . You 're a small-town gal caught up in the wrong crowd . Now you 're in over your head , and all you want is a way out . Disappear and leave this life behind . That the picture ? How did you know that ? I 've heard that tune a hundred times- - same song , different key . Now sing me the chorus . But you already know half of it . Humor me . I 'll even start . Barnabas has you under his thumb . He made me get close to Mr. Carson , to keep an eye on him while he searched for the jade elephant . Get close , huh ? Is that ' 40s talk for " have sex with " ? How dare you ? I am a lady . When Oliver double-crossed Mr. Barnabas , I knew he was a goner . That 's why I hired you , to keep him safe . You fell for Carson . I felt bad for Carson , but I didn 't love him . I have a man , and we 're gonna run away from all of this . Sure you are , kitten . Please . Please , you 've got to help me . Aw . Save it for the coppers . You have been dying to play that scene , haven 't you ? - Since I was 12 . - Yeah . I have to recalibrate the whole thing . What was Artie thinking ? He knows that he can 't just mess with a Tesla gren- - Oh , he can 't hear me , can he ? That is correct . What--what 's correct ? - What 's she saying ? - Nothing about you . Okay , this- - this could be our guy . Tell her to get out of there . Claude , get out of there before the thief sees you . Come on , come on , come on , come on , Claudia . Get out of there ! Calm down , I 'll fix it en route . Look , Artie , she has a plan . You 've been overreacting all day . We 'll use Claudia 's computer to hack into the traffic cams and follow the car . Artie , Artie , your car drove through you . - Are you all right ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . Good . Now , what were you thinking ? I was trying to save Claudia . How are you gonna save Claudia by jumping in front of a moving car ? No one else is dying on my watch ! Okay , she fixed the tracker . Let 's go . Do you mind opening the door ? Why would you rent the same car you already own ? I didn 't . I rented the same car that Claudia owns . Very cute . Does it also tuck you in at night ? Tell me you didn 't fall for Lily 's act . I don 't know . It makes sense . Barnabas kills Carson , grabs the elephant . Pete , don 't be fooled by a pretty face and a bad dye job . Excuse me . Are you the private dick ? Uh , why , yes . Yes , I am . Mykes , did you notice how I didn 't make a joke there ? I think I 'm maturing . Look at this . It 's got to be a trap . No , whoever wrote this- - we need to talk to them right now . Mykes , mykes . Hey , Myka . I don 't know how you got in here , but you better take to the air . What do you mean , how we got in here ? We--we used the front door like everyone else . No , he 's not talking about the club . He 's talking about the book . So you 're a real person too . Pete , this is Anthony Bishop , the author . Oh , my God , I 'm Myka Bering . - I 'm a big fan . - I 'm flattered , Miss . Now drop this case , or I shut both your private eyes for good . How 'd you know I was me anyway ? The handwriting on your cocktail napkin . It matched the notes on your title page of your book . My manuscript . How did you get in here ? Oh , man , you wouldn 't believe it . How did you get in here ? I ... I just- - Oh , what 's it matter ? Please , Mr. Bishop , it 's important . Well , if you 're a fan , then you know how I dedicate every book . " With love to my love . " They 're all dedicated to your wife . Right ? Something happened to her . It happened so fast . One day she was sick , then she was gone . I threw myself into a new novel , wrote a few chapters , and then , well ... The story was wrong . My wife was all I could think about . I 'd sit in front of my typewriter and close my eyes , and I 'd imagine this world . Then one day I opened my eyes . I was here . So it wasn 't writer 's block that created the artifact . It was grief . Yes , but our way out is still the same . Mr. Bishop , in order for us to get out of this world , we need to--well , we think we need to finish your story . Yeah , yeah , just tell us who did it , we 'll bring ' em to justice , grab our elephant . Bingo bango , we all go home . No , I don 't want this story to end . Stop trying to solve it . It was you . You erased Carson 's alias from the- - from the hotel register , didn 't you ? Why ? Mr. Bishop , what 's here for you ? Not what , Mykes . But who ? I saw you looking at Lily . You 're in love with her . You stay away from Lily . She 's special . She 's- - She 's based on your wife . Look , Mr. Bishop , we just want to get out of here , okay ? I mean , what 's that have to do with Lily ? All of his books end with someone innocent dying in a shootout . In this one , it 's supposed to be Lily , isn 't it ? That 's why you couldn 't finish your story . I couldn 't save her in the real world , but I will in here . So back off . Quit waving that iron around , you big palooka . - You 're a writer , not a killer . - Pete . Well , maybe not . But I can stop you from ever finishing this story . I won 't lose her again , see ? You 're in this book for good . Mr. Bishop ! See , this is why I don 't read . Pete . Come on , Barnabas is our only lead . We 're not safe here anymore , darling . We 've got to skip town . Where will we go ? Let 's go there . Bora Bora ? That 's just a daffy dream . Oh , it 's a dream I can make come true , but we got to go tonight . It takes a lot of clams to get to Bora Bora . Hmm . Say , toots , you seen Barnabas ? He got a phone call , and he dusted out , left me a lousy nickel . But , uh , I could keep you company until he gets back . Ah , rain check , sweetheart . I promise . Hmm . Great . They don 't have star-69 or caller ID in the ' 40s . And this is why you should watch movies . Operator . Say , doll , what 's your name ? Doris . Ah , I love that name . No , no , I really do . Let me guess ... Sultry voice , intoxicating laugh- - you 're a redhead . No , what do they say about redheads ? Jeepers , I 'd like to find out if that 's true . Uh ... Say , Doris , maybe you can help me out . Any chance you listened in on the last call ? Maybe--I don 't know- - something about an elephant ? Oh , brains too . You 're the whole package , Doris . Thanks , doll . You would 've done great in the ' 40s . Charm is timeless . Or women got smarter . Hello , sparky . Hello , artifact . Window shopper ! Are you sure this is the place ? According to my new pal Doris , he was buying an elephant on the 4th Street Bridge . And I quote , " I know . It 's weird , ain 't it ? " Pete , it looks like we 're too late . Electric burns , just like Carson . Pete , look at that . The scratches- - they look like they were made by fingernails . Yeah , long ones . It looks like he 's been attacked by a woman . Mykes , look at this . Barnabas fought back . Myka , we know a woman with long black hair . A woman who knew Carson well enough to know where he 'd hide out . Yeah , who was really pissed about her husband abandoning her . Rebecca Carson , the jilted wife . Man , can 't anyone in a Bishop novel be trusted ? Pete ! Rebecca , wait ! Don 't do this ! I loved Oliver , until he found this stupid elephant and dumped me for some dopey dame with a voice . What about Barnabas ? Did he deserve to die too ? Yes , Barnabas was loaded with dough . He promised to pay for the elephant , then decided he could just take it . So you killed Carson because he had it . You killed Barnabas because he wanted it . Now you 're gonna kill me just for looking at it ? You said it , sister . Aah ! Pete ! Pete , come on , wake up . Pete ! Pete ! Pete , come on , wake up . Pete ! God , didn 't CPR work in the 1940s ? Aghh ! Thank God you made it . That would have been a lousy ending . Did you get the elephant lady ? No , I decided to stick around and bring you back to life instead . Right . Good choice . Thanks . Mykes , she 's gonna need some dough if she 's gonna skip town . Rebecca thought Barnabas had loads of it . - Pete , the Indigo Club . - Let 's beat it . Tony , that 's not enough scratch to get us to San Diego , much less Bora Bora . Relax , lil , I know the combination to the safe , and Barnabas has got plenty . You better know the combination . Getting me that cabbage is all that 's keeping your little chippy alive . I 'll fry you both before you can pull the trigger . Nice scam , sales lady- - stealing cars and trying to sell them back to your boss . Cars deserve to be driven , okay ? People who lock them up like trophies don 't deserve them . Sounds like stealing to me , but who am I to judge ? I 'm about to steal those gloves from you . Claudia ! Are you all right ? I am gonna be sore tomorrow . This place is locked up tight . We 'll never get out of here in time to catch up to her . Oh , Steve of little faith . Snagged one during the fight because I 'm awesome . Okay , well , if she could- - you know what ? If she could make one glove work , I want to see if this is safe . - What ? - Artie ? What are you doing ? Old man totally tricked us . Well , to be fair , he wasn 't lying . You and your loogan just made a trip for biscuits . Now I 'm putting you in a wooden kimono . That 's not even English . Doesn 't matter , because this is over . You let Rebecca walk out of here so she lets Lily go , or you both die . The dame already fried two people , Bishop . The first chance she gets , she 'll drop you both into deep freeze . - I 'll take my chances . - Tony , are you bananas ? They 're on our side . Shut your trap , you dumb broad ! Scram , or I throw lead . You don 't want to lose someone you love . I get it . But this literally has to end . No , my life is here now , with Lily . Tony , I love you . But if you think I 'd let you hurt anybody just to save me , well ... You don 't know me at all . You 're just like her ... Pure and sweet and usually right . I know . - I love you , baby . - You 're all I care about . Save it for the boat ride . Bishop , there 's no way that Rebecca is a real person trapped in here too , is there ? No , I based her on my mother-in-law . Well , you 'll like this , then . Now , that 's hard-boiled . The gloves belonged to Carey Loftin . He did all the stunt driving on Vanishing Point and Bullitt . That 's why they only work on cars . He was a one-take wonder . He got every stunt the first try , never got a scratch on his cars . Loftin must have endowed the gloves with the ability to make any car untouchable . What was that noise ? It looks like the gloves can make any car untouchable but just once . Hence the one-take wonder . So your cars are crashable now ? Don 't worry . I 've got a plan . Oh , God ! - Artie , what are you doing ? - I 'm charging her . She 'll get scared . She 'll brake . Yeah , what if she doesn 't ? Artie , what if she doesn 't stop ? Artie ! Ha ! Yeah , see this wasn 't my first drag race . His first field mission in a while was bound to have some hiccups . He 's fine . Right . Okay , so why are we still here ? 'Cause we didn 't bring the killer to justice ? In a noir , a bullet is justice . - Hey , Mykes . - What ? I think I 'm getting some black-and-white vibage . I 'm working a hunch here , but just cross everything you got , sweetheart . Nice . How did you know that the fog would be our ride home ? It 's the end of Casablanca . They stole that from Bishop , you know ? And here he comes . I guess they stole the tearful good-bye too . I don 't understand . We love each other . We can go to Bora Bora now . I can 't stay . I 'm not from this world . It 's hard to explain . Believe me , I don 't want to go . Then stay with me . Be good , kid . What would happen if he stayed ? The story 's over . I don 't know if you get your happily ever after or you just fade away . One more second with her is a happier ending than a lifetime without her . Okay , now , that is a good line . All right , all right , I 'll read the books . Go ahead . You know you want to . So ... The detective and his- - Intrepid gal Friday . The detective and his gal Friday walked off into the fog and left the lovers in their embrace- - an embrace that would last forever ... Maybe , just maybe . Okay . That was , um ... What was that ? That was the stuff dreams are made of , sweetheart . And also painful- - ah- - really , really painful . All the pages have writing on them now . We finished the story . It 's just that jumping in front of a speeding car with Claudia in the trunk and playing chicken with a car thief , Artie wasn 't just putting himself in danger . It was everyone . And I know that he says that he was following his gut , but I 'm afraid that he 's being unnecessarily reckless , and I 'm really worried about him . Thank you for your candor . We 've been worried about Agent Nielsen as well . This confirms our fears . What does that mean ? It 's time for the Regents to act . When you asked me to keep an eye on Artie , you said it was to help him . Trust us , Agent Jinks . Well , wait a second . Mr. Kosan , I know what it 's like to go through trauma . And the last few months are not something that Artie will get through easily or quickly . We need to be there for him , not bronze him or turn him into some HG Wells hologram . Noted , Agent Jinks . The less you know , the better it is for Agent Nielsen . As I say , trust us . " He 's very dashing . " I am dashing , aren 't I ? What ? " With a big , dopey grin " ? What ?

" It was a long trip , " but it was worth it to see the look on Lily 's face " when she pressed her toes into the sand of Bora Bora " for the first time . " Neither of them had ever seen water this blue . " She smiled , brighter than the tropical sun . It made him happier than he 'd been in a long time . " Good for Bishop . Yeah . But ...

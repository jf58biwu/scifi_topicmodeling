 - = Lords of Kobol - FBK = - Raptor Niner-zero-niner . Interval check , you are a go for launch . Thrusters engaged , dradis is green , I see them . - Raptor 's away . - Open fire . We 're down two planes . We can 't keep them bottled up any longer . Toasters bought it . Those poor bastards are outnumbered ten to one . They 'll never make it . Fire the nukes ! At this range we may not clear the blast . Do it ! I can 't frakin see anything . Okay , contact ! Look out , guys . I 've got two ... No , three bandits ! Two klicks and closing . Wait , wait , wait ! I see ' em ! Seven o 'clock high ! Copy that , Kirby , I 'll follow your lead . Better take us down . Betting those things can 't handle in atmosphere . Roger that . Launchers are jammed ! Then take us in , we 'll trigger them manually . Affirmative ! These clouds are hiding a lot of crap . This is not gonna be easy . Now he gets humble . Just try to get us down in one piece , Husker ! Distance to target two klicks . Then take us in . We 'll trigger them manually . Give me manual override on the nukes . You have it . Distance is 1500 . Brace for contact , my friend . A nuke just went of . I 've lost dradis contact with the Syrius and the Base Star . Keep a grip , kid . Bandits right up our asses ! We 're gonna have to get behind them . I can do better ! Coker get on that tail gunner . Try to hit something this time ! You worry about the flying , I worry about the shooting . I got one ! I frakking got one ! We 're all right ! Godsdamnit ! Guys a little help here ! Please ! We 're getting our asses kicked . Got him ! - He 's on my six , I can 't shake him ! - Wait , I see him ! Dolores is down ! I 'm hit ! Evading ! I 'm sorry , Coker . - I 'm going home . - Repeat , Kirby . I didn 't copy that . I 'm going home . Kirby ! Kirby , what the frak ? I 'm out of ammo ! Coker , where is he ? - 200 m and closing ! - Good ! Hydraulics are shot . I 'm losing attitude control . We 've lost the left engine ! Just find a safe place to land ! Com 's shot and the nav system 's a mess . If I can get that left engine back on line , I could get her off the ground . No way , there 's too much damages . Only way out is to get Kelly to her rendezvous . Rendezvous ? Are you nuts ? You know how many people died on that ship ? I 'm talking to you ! Do you know how many people ? Typical crew compliment of an Orion class ship is about a hundred and fifty , not counting the pilots . Let 's for fun count the pilots , ' cause I 'm pretty sure they 're dead too , Get your things . We 're moving out . No , Husker , we ain 't going anywhere unless I frakking say so ! - I 'm getting tired of that name ... - If the shoe fits ... And I 'm really getting tired of this frakked-up attitude . You need to soldier up and stop whining like a gutless short-timer That 's it ? One week out of flight school and you 're calling me yellow ? You want to go home ? The fastest way to do that is to find those Marines . I can pinpoint the location of their transponder using my encrypted tracking device . Alright ? They 're gonna have their own extraction plan . We can piggyback with them . I don 't see any alternative . This bird kept me safe for years and I frakking hate leaving her like this . I know . Signal 's strong ahead . They should be here . We 're still getting signal ? - Are we ? - Yes . The transponder 's here . What happened to these guys ? These aren 't gunshot wounds . Transponder 's still broadcasting . We found the recon team . That 's it . We 've found them , they 're dead . This mission is a bust . I 'm going back to the raptor . Well , this has been a real treat . But I think it 's time we get out of here . Any takers ? Let 's go ! Beka ? - Cocker ? - Here . Beka , where are you ? Down ! We 're down here . You 're OK ? Oh , is he OK ? Welcome to the party ? If that was your attempt to the rescue you got a E for effort - and a F for frakking it up . - You don 't appreciate crap . How are we gonna get out of here ? What the hell is this ? There 's gotta be another way out here . What was that ? Did you see that ? What are these holes ? - There 's something in the walls . - What ? - The frak was that ? - The walls we 're fraking talkin about . What was that ? What the frak was that ? Cocker are you bitten ? Yes I 'm frakking bitten . - What is it ? - I don 't know . Get it of me ! - I can 't get a clear shot . - Hold still . Get it off of me . Shot the motherfrakker ! You 're late . Are we cool , with this thing ? Don 't worry tough guy , it 's as dead as the one down below . You must be captain Ramirez ? Do I look like a Ramirez ? Captain 's on ice with the marines . I 'm all that 's left . Toth , Tech Sergeant , Demolitions . - I was thinking you wouldn 't make it . - We almost didn 't . What the frak are these things ? Toasters have been using this planet to test track cyborg critters : half machine , half organic , and very hard to kill unless you have the right weapon . It 's very ... good eating , though . - How long you 've been here ? - You don 't want to know . No , thank you . Maybe later . I 'm alright for now . I 'm sorry . I couldn 't get here any quicker after I saw your signal . Speaking of which , who 's got that bitch ? Right , now ... we won 't get any more company . - That how they found your unit ? - Toasters didn 't find them . We were breaking camp . Captain send me up to recognize the neighborhood . and when I got back , well ... the demons had ambushed them . Frakking abominations . Whole war 's a frakking abomination . Ain 't that right flight boy ? Ain 't that right ? Ain 't that right , frakker ? Sergeant , please . I assume you 've been briefed on my mission . How long to get us to my objective ? Storm 's gonna get worse and you don 't wanna be caught out here when it does . Plus , there 's a Toaster patrol and they see better in this crap than us . I 'm sorry , but I 've got a timetable . I can 't just sit around and wait . It 'll blow over by morning , Plus I 've got a secure location where we can hole up for tonight . - You want to pack that to go ? - Yeah , no , we just ate . I 'm not frakking going with you , because I ... Apply pressure to the occipital nerve and the carotide artery and it clunches in eight seconds , dead in ten . five , six , seven , eight ... Like I said . Let 's get going . Come on . Get up !

 Can you find out who has one of these ? - I need the code that liberates the Hubots . - I don 't have it . I can create it again . They 've activated my auto-shutdown , so that I can not escape . Give me the code , and Beatrice will be treated well . I have the battery that you need . If you are discovered , I lose you . Let go of it ! What you saw is a secret , OK ? Do not tell mommy ! - I am Petra . - Florentine Douglas wake up ! I did a download I should not have done . - I was just thinking ... - Go ! - Go away ! Do you still have the device that checks for the HSN Trojan ? What does it say ? Hans ? What is going on ? - It sounded like a baby screaming . - Tobbe , go to bed . - We must do something . - Everything is fine . Go to sleep , Tobbe . - I 'll help Mimi . You go to sleep . - Okay . Mimi , do you hear me ? Hello ? We need to tell the others . This is too complicated . - No , I do not think so . - Should we just wait ? I am infected with the HSN Trojan . There is nothing to do . Real Humans Season 2 Why did you erase it ? It was not right . Well do it right , then ! It takes time to give the beautiful machines free will . Jonas ! Continue . - Are you ready yet ? - We 'll see . - Odi 's battery needs replacing . - It 's so damn disturbing . - Change it to a newer model ! - What 's disturbing ? - Excuse me . - What ? - It 's time . - No . It is not good if Beatrice shuts down . It 's not good for my nerves if you do not finish soon . - Her battery may be damaged . - Huh ? What ? You are not living up to our agreement . Then you do not want my help , so ... Isn 't it best to reset her ? Time is being wasted ... This is so damn ineffective . - Shall I ... ? - YEAH ! Okay . - What the hell ... - You have to warm it up . - 13 seconds left . - Take it easy , dammit ! 8 , 7 , 6 ... 5 , 4 , 3 ... 2 , 1 ... There is another solution . What ? Remove the lock completely . - Sure ... - This is so strange . I would do anything if you helped me . Anything ... There is one thing , I would like from you . Your battery . HSN Trojan cure - What are you watching ? - I 'm just researching a bit . - Where , the sites of the virus ? - Yea ... that was it . I 'm reading . Aren 't you late for work ? - Well , I should go now . - OK , see you tonight , then . Um-hum [ KNOCKING ] [ KNOCKING ] Florentine ? Florentine ? Are you here ? - Yea ... are we going , then ? - Going where ? The reading of the will . We 'll learn how the estate should be divided . I have Marianne , it 's the only thing that matters . Steady now Florentine ... I understand that it is difficult . I just I do not understand . This empty space ... - He was here and now he 's not here . - I know ... This is exactly what death means . Will it be forever ? Yes ... I do not want it that way . No . I do not want it that way either , but now it 's how it is . We need to leave . Douglas wanted for you to hear his will . Can I borrow you for a few minutes ? Yes , for ? We 'll open Douglas ' will . There they are . Claes ... Florentine ... I do not know what to say . " My last wish to have precedence over earlier wills " " would any such be found . " " Written in my right mind . Carl Douglas Jarméus . " Witnessed by Inger Engman and signed by myself . - That was all of it , right ? - It was the Testament in its entirety . And the rest then ? The summer house and boat and the cottage in the Alps ? - The house here is worth at least 15 million . - This was the complete assets ... We are entitled to more . Where is the rest ? Douglas has given most of the estate to Florentine . - This is certainly a shock . - It 's bullshit ! - Mother ... - We 'll contact a lawyer . - Do not make yourself a laughing stock . - Mother ... Should dad 's Hubot have it all ? Sit down . Petra , stop ! Albert , come on , we 're going . No ... - Ahhh ... oh , damn ! - He he he ... . Silas , there is a problem with the Mother-Hubot 's doll . - What ? She just got a new one . - Well yeah but ... . Can 't anything go well without a problem every five minutes ! She 's nagging ... He 's sick . He needs a doctor . Listen ! - He ​ ​ needs a doctor ! - I 'm a doctor . - Not you . HE will help me . Roger ? Not Roger . Never Roger . He who comes in the night , He who comes in the night ... He who comes in the night ... He who comes in the night ... I 'm a doctor . I have identification . - I am a surgeon . - He can help . - It 's his arm . - Yea , let 's see ... - Careful ! - Yeah , OK ... so ... [ METAL DOOR OPENS ] Five minutes then . [ METAL DOOR CLOSES ] Beatrice ... I have improved the code . What have you done ? Removed the automatic shutdown . - You didn 't give it to Jonas ? - No , it 's not ready , to be released What do you mean ? You cannot hide the code . It belongs to everyone - it does not belong to me . - When it is finished I 'll set it free . - It sounds ... wonderful , darling . We will do this - when we 've taken over here . I have a problem with Roger . - He is in love with you . - He doubts my feelings . I need your help . [ KNOCKING ] Hello ? Hello , is there anybody here ? Hello ? Is there anybody here ? Hello ? - Hello . Who are you ? - Hans Engman . The father of Tobbeas and Matilda . You 're Einar ? - Your wife has already scolded me . - I 'm not here to argue . I need help . The witch hunt sending them to recycling is all about greed . You can repair them , but they want people to buy new ones . - So it is possible to remove it ? - What device are we talking about ? Vera - a geriatric Hub that we bought for my wife 's father . I see . Didn 't you sell Vera ? We rented her ... temporarily . Do this : You re-format the hard drive and reinstall the software . Restart - and poof - the virus is gone . But the memory , and all the learned behavior disappears too . It 's the price you pay . But if we hypothetically talking about a Hub that is more like your Mimi for example ... Maybe the price is too high . Can Florentine own all his stuff ? No . Will they take them away from her ? I do not know . One can imagine a situation in which he placed the properties in a foundation . That is a legal entity . So things can own themselves ? Hey , baby ! - Hans ! What are you doing here ? - I need to be with Mimi all day . For what ? She 'll help me arrange something . Like what ? A surprise . I can 't tell what it is . Mimi ? I 'll help Hans with his surprise . Well then , I 'll see you tonight . See you ... I think I know how we can get rid of the trojan . Hello ! Hans Engman . We can not remove the virus , but maybe we can isolate it . Do you go into the operating system ? No . We have to do it manually . Manually ? What ? Are you going to cut into Mimi ? Yes . But it will get rid of it ? We 've never done it before . But it guarantees that she does not get worse ? No . [ PHONE RINGING ] - Roger , the phone 's ringing . Can you get it ? - Sure . - Why is she locked up ? - She 'll be cut up soon . Why ? Phone ! Roger ! Telephone ! Hub Battle Land , Roger . Can you say it again ? We are open . Every day . Hey . Did you get the battery I need ? I 'll check again for it . I promise . - Do you see what I 'm doing ? - No . What does it do ? It sets conflicting desires against each other . - Okay , I do not really understand . - Look here . What 's up with that ? Here is a death instinct , against self-preservation . Pretty interesting choice , huh ? What does a death instinct give you ? What do you think ? - The stronger one . - When both alternatives are equally good . - Then I 'll take more of the one , then . - What do you want to get more of ? - To survive . - Why ? - If I had to choose ... - There ... It is there you lack in your reasoning . If you get to choose , it has no free will . Then you 've ruined the code . Then what reasoning does it need in order to make the right decision ? The ability to self-develop their conclusions based on external stimuli . Talk less , work more ! Knock it off ! Give me that ! Mario ... here . Why doesn 't it say anything about the battery on this one ? Check it out . The only thing that remains is a case number . The document has been deleted . Shouldn 't we be able to identify the batteries ? Wait Odi , wait ! Odi , Odi .. You have to be completely still when I do this . OK ... .. 1 , 2 , 3 ! Damn , damn ... Odi ? Odi ? ODI ! I will not get a new battery . What are you talking about ? I promised you , you know that . Lennart also used to say stuff like that - what he thought I wanted to hear . Listen to me ! You WILL get a new battery . I 'll show you something . Something that I have not shown to anyone else . Check this out ... That 's me . That 's Bruno . When I was 5 years old I was in foster care because my mom was well ... she had a problem . Then I met Bruno . He taught me to ride a bike . He was my best friend . He said good night to me at night . He was an early model . At that time , your kind were not waterproof . You could only handle just a little rain . And I knew that . I knew it . But I did not care about it ... I wanted to swim . There was a short circuit and they could not save him . Do you know who is my best friend ? No . - Don 't you know who it is ? - No . Okay . Damn , you 're my friend anyway . [ MOBILE PHONE RINGING ] - Have you gotten your hands on it ? - No , sorry , not that . I 've found something else . What then ? That symbol you asked me to look for ... The initials . DB . There is such a unit here . It must lie down on its stomach . - Take off the clothing on the upper body . - Is that necessary ? I need to hook into the central management system . Huh ? The spine . Uh-huh Yea ... maybe I 'll wait outside . Do not leave . There ... it will be fine . I 'll be right outside . It will go well . I would like to be turned off now . Mimi must be turned on , because the virus is present in the software . Mimi under no circumstances should you move now . A clone , ID deleted , it was picked in the town . Clear signs of the virus , but our scans have not shown anything positive . You 'll have to wait . You 'll have to check it later , OK ? Wait ! Hide ! Come on ! - Goddamn , you want to get caught ? - Okay , we 'll take it somewhere else . Quiet ! - No . Go ! - This is madness . - Are you happy or what ? - Check the glove box . - Well , now there 's just the battery left . - Fuck it . This 'll do just as well . - Einar , may I ask you a question ? - Sure , ask whatever you like . They are just machines , right ? What are you doing here then ? I want to go home now . You , then we 'll get out of here . - Move the car ! - No . I have to get out . I will not let you disappear with my grandchild . You can not take Marianne away from me ! I know how happy you made Douglas . I also know you have been a loving mother to Marianne . None of that has changed . They can take Marianne away from me . I do not normally use expletives , but if someone tries to take Marianne from you ... I 'll see them in hell ! I do it here . It is not figure skating . Let me think ! Yeah , but ... orientation . - Figure Skating . - No . Let 's see on the card ! Mimi ? Hello ! - Come and sit . - You can sit here . - You will get beat . - What color am I ? Blue . I 'll move for you ... - Tobbeas ... you should read it . - Brown was there , huh ? Steady now ... I 've got no grip . Careful now . Do not drop it . - Careful , I said ! - Calm the fuck down ! - What the hell is that ? What is it ? - It 's nothing . Gently down ... - One of yours ? - No . Look again . I have never seen him before . DB ... David 's Child . It requires no great knowledge to create a screensaver . Just knowledge of what DB is , of course . Turn ​ ​ it on . Turn it off . Dear child ... Who has done this to you ? - It 's your fucking code ! - Someone has done something wrong . You have to give it the consciousness of one 's own mortality step by step . Anxiety is otherwise too great . Roger , stay here with them . Silas , you 're with me . We do not talk anymore in David Eischers vicinity . - He will not follow your instructions ? - Exactly . He does nothing . - Don 't you find it strange ? - Yea . Damn strange . Look at this ... - The date ! - A few weeks ago . Exactly . The Hubot inside got the code installed only recently . - Somebody out there has the code ! - Yeah , of course . But who ? The sooner you find out the less need I have to keep Beatrice Eischer alive . - So it 's you who is Roger ? - Yeah , right . Do we know each other ? You know my wife well . Beatrice Eischer . You called her Bea . - I have not done anything . - Have not you been together ? It did ... she was just ... Just my life 's greatest love . Who does not want to know me anymore . Because of me ? Yes . Because of you . What did you expect ? I did not know she was married . That makes me feel so much better . Thank you , Roger . Go back to the front desk now . - It 's quitting time now . - Silas is on a case , stay until he returns . OK , sure . - What did you talk about ? - Don 't concern yourself . Was it about Beatrice ? This will be the last time . Jonas , would you mind if we have some time alone ? - I don 't trust you . - If you do not allow it ... You 'll what ? You won 't write the real code ? What if I tear out the fuse in beloved Bea . - If you do , you have nothing . - Maybe . Maybe not . Now we 'll do this my way . My way is that I stay here . See you soon . I am ready to start working again . I thought so . - Tobbe ... - What are you doing ? - I do not understand . - You and Dad . What do you mean ? One minute you throw yourself at me . The next , you do not know me . That 's not true . Do you know why I fell in love with you ? You were not like everyone else . Now you are fake and lie all the time . And you do not care about anyone else . Congratulations , now you are really human - in the worst possible way . [ Arabic ] - I will not do it . [ Arabic ] - My father will not do it . [ Arabic ] He promised . [ Arabic ] I must have a little patience . I forgot to take my Hub fluid . I need it right now - I 'll get it . - Hurry . Here ... Hey , this surprise , that you needed Mimi 's help with ... When ... should we be expecting it ? - Have you seen Mimi ? - She 's in her room . She 's gone . She wanted her Hub fluid and she was acting a little weird . What do you mean ? - There was something in her eye . - Oh-Hell ! - Hans ? Hans wait ! - I 'm going with . - How did she look ? - There was something strange about her eye . - What 's wrong with her ? - Never mind . Keep looking Tobbe , come-on ! There ! Over there ! - Where ? - There . Remain in the car , Tobbe . Just let me talk to her , OK ? Mimi ... Mimi ... ride home with us . - It did not help . - I know . But ... what happened ? I can 't tell you now Tobbe - - Stay in the car . - Mimi , stop ! You can not run away . You belong home with us . I cannot . I have disgraced both myself and my family . You have done nothing . I made an illegal download , even though I knew the consequences . We 'll deal with the consequences and tell everyone what happened . - Is this my punishment ? - It 's not you who created the trojan . But I 'm ... I will probably die now . Yea ... it may have to be . I 'm really sorry it did not work . Me too ... Pen ! What have you done ? There ... you were lucky . Please help to carry her . Sure . Good job ... Roger . You can go home for the day . You must understand that I 'm doing this your own sake , to help you . I want to go home . I have explained : That 's not your home . Roger is not your friend . What do you want now ? I want to go home . This is not personal . This is war . I want to help you to protect our Hub Battle Land . - Here ... - What the hell is this ? The Incident Report . It says nothing about the owner unfortunately . The date . Here 's the address . I 'm sorry I do not have more . Is this the address ? If it 's correct , I need nothing more . Jonas , guess where the Hubot came from ! - Don 't you recognize me ? - No . I know you . If I say Hub Market , what do you say then ? Jo ... Jonas ? An explosion later ! - We sent flowers to the hospital . - I know . You work late ? Yea ... yes , exactly . But I 'm just ready ... I 'm working on a simple parallel application that ... - Like what ? - A simple background thing only . May I purchase it ? It 's not finished . I can buy it in any case . What do you want for it ? It 's getting late . I must go home . We can talk about that another day . We 'll go to lunch , okay ? Lunch ? I do not want to hurt you . I do not think you should experience the hell I 've been through . You can 't imagine . They took skin from my buttocks to patch up the worst . - I do not understand ... - The Code ! That 's what I want . The code that my Dad helped David Eischer develope before David betrayed him . The code that both my parents have paid for with their lives ! You will get your ... reward , don 't worry about that . Or you may also want to have a face made from your own ass ? Your choice ! We 'll see about the lunch . Hi ... - Tobbe ? - What ? ! - Is there anything else you have not told me ? - Yes . How could you tell Dad , but not me ? - I did not think of it . - Don 't you trust me ? I 'm afraid . I am too . I 'm sorry I have failed you . [ DOOR OPENS ] He 's here now , he who comes in the night . - He who comes in the night ... - He who comes in the night ... Take him . Save him . One day , you will all be free . One day , you will no longer have to fight . One day , the sun rise over a free Hub Battle Land . RICK ! RICK ! RICK ! Subtitles : LesStrater

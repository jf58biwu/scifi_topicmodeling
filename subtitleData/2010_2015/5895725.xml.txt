 Previously on The 100 ... - Mom ? - You 're being sent to the ground . All 100 of you . Prisoners of the Ark , you have one job stay alive . To do that , you must locate Mount Weather immediately . Nothing we 've tried will save the Ark . Have you tried not saving it ? Are we really gonna do this ? Bring the Ark to the ground ? You started a war that you don 't know how to end . You have no idea what your people have done . We had to stop the attack . The mountain men-They 'll come , and they 'll kill us all . - Raven ! - Murphy shot her . - Get her into the dropship . - We need to leave . There 's an army of Grounders coming for us right now . If we stay here , we will die tonight . So pack your things . Just take what you can carry . Now ! That should stop the external bleeding . I don 't understand . How did Murphy get a gun ? - Long story . - We got lucky . If Murphy hit the fuel tank instead of me , we 'd all be dead . Wait , there 's rocket fuel down there ? Enough to build a bomb ? Enough to build a hundred bombs , if we had any gunpowder left . Let 's get back to the Reapers . Maybe they 'll help us . " The enemy of my enemy is my friend , " right ? Not this enemy . We saw them . Trust me ... - ... that 's not an option . - There 's no time for this . - Can she walk or not ? - No . - We have to carry her . - The hell you will . I 'm good to go . Hey ! Listen to me . That bullet is still inside you . If by some miracle there 's no internal bleeding , it might hold until we get somewhere safe . But you are not walking there . Is that clear ? Yeah . Get the stretcher . Can 't run away fast enough , huh ? Real brave . Dying in a fight you can 't win isn 't brave , Bellamy . It 's stupid . Spoken like every coward who 's ever run from a fight . All right , that 's enough ! It 's time to go . If they follow , it 's a 120-mile walk to the ocean . Look , we 're wasting time . If he wants to stay , he can stay . No , he can 't . We can 't do this without you , Bellamy . What do you want me to say , Clarke ? I want you to say that you 're with us . Those kids out there , they listen to you . They 're lining up to go . They listen to you more . I gave them an easy choice . But five minutes ago , they were willing to fight and die for you . You inspire them . And I 'm afraid we 're gonna need that again before this day is through . Okay , here we go . Guns at the ready ! Keep your eyes open . You did good here , Bellamy . - Eighteen dead . - Eighty-two alive . You did good . You know the first thing I 'm gonna do when I get to the beach ? - No , what ? - I 'm going surfing . Quiet . Keep your eyes open . No more woods . Hear the ocean . No damn trees . Just pale blue water . What is it ? Why are we stopping ? I don 't know . I don 't see anything . Grounders ! Go , go , go ! Shut the gate ! Load your guns . Get her inside the dropship . Yeah , we got her . Where are they ? Why aren 't they attacking ? Because we 're doing exactly what they wanted us to do . What 're you talking about ? Lincoln said the scouts would be the first to arrive . If it 's just scouts , we can fight our way out . That 's what Lincoln would do . We 're done doing what that Grounder would do . We tried it , and now Drew is dead . You want to be next ? That Grounder saved our lives . I agree with Octavia . For all we know there 's one scout out there . One scout with insanely good aim . Clarke , we can still do this . Looking to you , princess . What 's it going to be ? Run and get picked off out in the open ? Or stand and fight back ? Clarke , if we 're still here when Tristan gets here ... Lincoln said scouts . More than one . He said , " Get home before the scouts arrive . " Finn , they 're already here . Looks like you 've got your fight . Okay then . This is what we 've been preparing for . Kill them before they kill us . Gunners , to your posts . Use the tunnels to get in and out . From now on the gate stays closed . Oh , Oh . - You 're not a gunner . - No , I 'm not . Like you said , I 'm a Grounder . All right , let 's get through those foxholes . So how the hell do we do this ? We 've got 25 rifles with 20 rounds each , give or take . Roughly 500 rounds of ammo . While you two were gone we made some improvements . Thanks to Raven , the gully 's mined . Partially mined , thanks to Murphy . Still , it 's the main route in . And if the Grounders use it , we 'll know . She also built grenades . - It 's not many . - Again , thank you , Murphy . We 'll make ' em count . If the Grounders make it through the front gate , guns and grenades should force them back . And then ? Then we close the door and pray . And pray what ? That the ship keeps them out , because it won 't . Then let 's not let them get through the gate . All foxholes , listen up . Keep your eyes and ears open . Inflict casualties , as many as possible . We can hold them off long enough to make them tum back . That 's the plan . That 's always your plan . Just like the bomb at the bridge . Damn right . You got a better idea ? Can 't be that simple . You said there 's fuel in those rockets , right ? Enough to build a hundred bombs . I also said we 've got no gunpowder left . I don 't want to build a bomb . I want to blast off . Draw them in close . Fire the rockets . A ring of fire . Barbecued Grounders . I like it . Will it work ? The wiring 's a mess down there , but yeah . You give me enough time , I 'll cook them real good . Here 's how we bring the Ark to the ground . Stage one , separation from Go site . Series of explosions . Sever the ring that we are now standing in from the rest of the Ark . Now , once we have separation all port thrusters will fire and our orbit will begin to degrade . Stage two , reentry . Reentry will be violent and it will be very , very hot . Friction will break the Ark back into its original stations . Some of the stations , and we can 't predict which will explode . Some of us will be on those stations . Which brings us to stage three , landing . All starboard thrusters on the surviving stations will fire . Acting as landing rockets , they will slow the impact even further . And our target speed for impact with the ground is 70 miles per hour . In all my simulations , anything above that is not survivable . This isn 't safe . There 's no way we can survive this . No one said that this would be easy , ladies and gentlemen . It 's just that if we don 't try it , we all die . So how close are we gonna land to the kids ? As close as we can . - Finn , do you see it over there ? - No . Raven , we can 't find the ignition system . Raven ? - I can 't feel my legs . - Okay , hold on . We 're coming . Okay , let me see them . That bad , huh ? Raven the bullet 's in your spine . You 're bleeding internally . We better do this fast then , huh ? Get back down there . Okay . What if we can slow the bleeding ? Would that help ? Of course it would help . Can you tell me how to do that ? That stuff the Grounders had . Coagulant . You said that Lincoln had some too . Yeah , it 's in the box with the antidote . But I- - I 'm betting that there 's more of it in his cave . If I can- - Wait a second . No ! I can make it . Clarke , tell him he 's being an idiot . - Raven . - What ? I 'm not gonna let you die to save me . Fine . If you won 't let me save you , how about we save everybody else ? You 're the only one who can fire those rockets . If you die , we all die . I 'll be right back . Finn , wait . - Wait . - Clarke , I need to do this . I can 't lose you again . You won 't . Hydro station , good to go . Mecha station , good to go . Factory station , good to go . Aero station , good to go . Power station , good to go . Chancellor Jaha , all stations are prepared for launch . In peace may you leave this shore . In love , may you find the next . Safe passage on your travels until our final journey to the ground . - May we meet again . - May we meet again . - Sinclair . - Yes , sir . - Take us home . - Taking us home , sir . Initiate Go site separation . In five ... Four ... Three ... Two ... One . Separate . Sir , remote detonations failed . We are negative for Go site separation , negative for launch . - Can you fix it ? - Not from here , sir . No . Someone will have to launch manually . What 're you doing ? Someone has to stay behind , Abby . There has to be another way . I can go back and reprogram the system , but it 'll take time . We 'll miss the window for the eastern United States . We won 't land anywhere near the hundred . Then we 'll wait till it comes back around again . The Ark will be out of air by then . Salvation ... How much air will he have ? A week . Two weeks at most . We 're away . We 're away . We 've launched . How ? Godspeed , my friends . Godspeed . - Thelonious , where are you ? - Right where I 'm supposed to be . Hold on tight , Abby . You 'll see your daughter soon . And I 'll see my son . They 're here . Where 's Octavia ? She left five minutes ago . Didn 't say where to . She thinks she 's a damn samurai . - See anything ? - No . What the hell are they waiting for ? The longer they wait the better . This is about buying time for Raven . I see them . They 're moving . I count one , two , three . No , like there 's four . I don 't know man . There 's too damn many of them . - Who was that ? - Sterling , I think . South foxhole . South foxhole , report now ! Yeah , yeah . We 're okay . They didn 't attack . It 's like shooting a ghost . There ! I see them ! Stop ! Stop ! Hold your fire ! Hold fire ! Reload , now ! Those are our last clips . We should- - We should pull back . No . If this position falls , they 'll walk right to the front door . - Do you see it or don 't you ? - No . - It 's a mess down here . - It 'll be orange . Look harder . Foxhole , report . You have to find the wire that connects the manual override to electromagnet . It 's not rocket science . It is rocket science , actually . Guess we finally found something you 're not good at . I used to be picked first for everything . Earth skills . Zero G Mac course . First . Every time . So how did I end up here ? Hey , Raven ? I 'd pick you first . Of course you would . I 'm awesome . - Hey , I found it . Orange wire . - About time ! Now follow that wire to the override panel . Raven , it 's fried . Totally useless . Tell me this isn 't as bad as I think . You know how to splice the wire ? - No . - That 's worse . Aah ! Hey , stop . Just keep talking me through it . Get down ! We need back up ! Raven , their mines actually work . Jasper can splice . Jasper , we need you in the dropship right now . Negative . We can 't give up the west Woods . The west woods are mined , Bellamy . The Grounders just figured that out . Jasper , get in here . I see one ! There ! There ! We 're drawing their fire . - Damn it , I 'm all out . - They want us to run out of ammo . All gunners , listen up . The Grounders are not attacking . They 're making us waste bullets . Don 't shoot when they 're running laterally . Jasper 's right . Don 't fire until you 're sure it 's attack . Repeat , do not fire until you are sure . Clarke , hang tight . I 'm on my way . That 's for not telling us about the minefield . What do we do now ? Now we attack . Here they come . Monroe , get back there ! Bellamy ! Admit it . You were wrong . No ! You 're hit . No . Fall back now ! Can you walk ? Oh , hey , hold on to me . We have to get you behind that wall . - Lincoln , you made it . - I told you to leave . We tried . The scouts were already there . Sterling , do you copy ? What is that ? I 'll go back to camp to get more bullets . Why are you not there ? Raven was shot . We need medicine to slow the bleeding . - You came to save one life ? - I don 't have time to explain . - Do you have the medicine or not ? - I have it . Fall back ! No , stand your ground . If they take the gate , we 're all dead . I 'm going with you . Let 's go . Wait . - " The enemy of my enemy is my friend . " Finn , let 's move . How far did the Reapers chase you ? They 'd still be chasing if I didn 't lose them , why ? I have a really bad idea . Hey , Raven , tell us again how this is gonna work . I told you five times . Current flows to the electromagnet . That opens the propel valve . Rockets fire . Okay . Got the , uh ... Got the wire ready to graft on . What 's next ? Raven ? Raven . - Is she ? - Not yet . But soon . They 've broken through . There 's hundreds of them . They 're heading for the gate . Game over , man . Finish it . Current to magnet to valve to barbecue . There are too many ! Everybody to the dropship , now . No , we need more time . Gunners , stay at your posts . The rest of you , inside . Come on , quick . Is that from the Ark ? That is the Ark . I 'm coming , Clarke . Reinforcements . When they get here , they won 't find anyone alive . Take down the gate ! Attack ! Attack ! Reapers ! My God ! What did you do ? - We kicked the hornet 's nest . - You brought the Reapers ? I just bought us some time . How 's Raven ? She 's not good . And the rockets aren 't ready yet . Jasper 's working on them now . Wait , Jasper ? - What 's plan B ? - Jasper was plan B. - Who is that ? - I don 't know . While they 're distracted , let 's move . I 'll never make it . Leave me . - I 'll find another way . - I 'm not going anywhere without you . Octavia . Lincoln . Who did this ? With Finn . It 's deep . I can help you , but you have to come with me now . Go . - Let him help . - No way . I have to see this through . You can 't walk , and I can 't get you back to the dropship . He 's right . This fight is over for you . Ov . Ov , listen to me . I told you my life ended the day you were born . The truth is , it didn 't start until then . So go with him . I need you to live . Besides , I got this . I love you , big brother . May we meet again . May we meet again . Keep her safe . Now to the wall ! Clarke , they 're taking down the gate . Good . ' Cause I did it . I think . - I 'm closing that door . - Wait . We still got people out there . Bellamy 's not back yet . Use the grenades ! All right , Jasper did it . Everybody get inside now . - There he is ! - He 's never gonna make it . Bellamy , run ! He 's killing him . Give me that . No , Finn , no ! No ! Clarke ! You can 't save everybody . Let 's go ! Clarke , in now ! No ! Aah ! Finally . Jasper , now ! No ... Anya , you can 't win . Aah ! - Stop ! She 's not- - - Current close to the magnet . You just stay put . Get back ! Get back ! Screw her . - She deserves to die . - No ! We are not Grounders . This is Earth Monitoring Station . Earth Monitoring Station . Hailing all Ark survivors , please come in . Earth Monitoring Station . Earth Monitoring Station . Hailing all Ark survivors , please come in . Hello ? ls someone there ? - The grou- - - Keep talking so I can lock you in . On the ground , repeat . Mecha Station is on the ground . Abby , it 's so good to hear your voice . Yours too . We made it , Thelonious . Any word from any of the other stations yet ? No . Just you so far . - Can you see any sign of them ? - Going outside now . Standby . Tell me what it 's like . It 's everything I dreamed . So much green . There are trees everywhere . And water . And the air , the air smells ... It 's sweet . It 's so beautiful . Thelonious , you should be here . Abby , look . There 's smoke in the distance . There might be another station . - We 'll check it out . - You do that . Find the rest of our people , Abby . Find Clarke . This will have to do . May we meet again . What the hell ... Mountain men . Clarke . Monty .

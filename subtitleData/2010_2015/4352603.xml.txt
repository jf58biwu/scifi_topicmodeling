 RUSH : I may be on the verge of discovering the true nature ofDestiny 's mission . ELI : You 've had control of this ship the whole time ! Why wouldn 't you tell anyone ? The Lucian Alliance is planning an attack on Earth . YOUNG : I killed Riley . I suffocated him with my own hands . You are a good commander . YOUNG : There is no mission other than getting these people home . RUSH : It was never about going home , it 's about getting us to where we 're going . That is the mission . GREER : And if ever you were gonna have a chance with anyone , this is probably it . RUSH : I 've thought a lot about you . YOUNG : We need to talk . I 'm sorry ? - Where 's Ginn ? - She 's on Earth . Ginn told Homeworld Command that Simeon had intelligence about an attack that was being planned against Earth . Then he killed Ginn . BARNES : Amanda Perry is dead . ( SCREAMING ) TELFORD : There 's been an attack . We think there might be a bomb onboard , as yet unexploded . VARRO : I think I can help . I can tell you how to defuse that bomb . GREER : Have you heard anything ? Not yet . Day six . Shifts running continuously around the clock , just like you ordered , but still no connection . ( DOOR BUZZES OPEN ) I 'm up next . You okay ? Yeah . Just ... Leg fell asleep . Okay . Checkmate . Again . You might want to put a bit of effort into it this time . Doesn 't it bother you ? We don 't know if that bomb was defused in time . You 're worried about your mom . I 'm worried about everyone . So , again ? ( CHUCKLES ) Come on , take your mind off it for half an hour or so . Couple of minutes , the way you 're playing . VOLKER : Also Sprach Zarathustra . It 's the theme from 2001 : A Space Odyssey . - So why didn 't you just say that ? - Because that 's not what it 's called . It 's called Also Sprach Zarathustra , Thus Spoke Zarathustra . It 's by Strauss . But nobody knows it by that name , so why not just say the name people know about ? Look , you asked me what my favorite piece of music was , - and I 'm telling you . That 's what it is . - Yeah , I 'm just saying ... It 's the one piece that reminds me of the very moment - I wanted to be an astrophysicist . - Right , when you saw 2001 ? Yes . That 's my point . That people know that song - only because of the movie . - Song ? It 's not a song , Brody . Oh , it 's not a song now ? You all right ? Yes . It 's you . You get me wound up with your stupid ... Hey , hey ... Colonel Young , this is Brody . Come in . YOUNG : Go ahead . I think we have a connection . You 're aboard the Destiny . I 'm Colonel Young . Who are you ? I 'm Ginn . What happened ? GINN : I had some trouble breathing , at first . Dr. Perry 's condition was difficult to adjust to . - Eli . - ELI : Ginn ? It 's you ? Really ? - What happened , then ? - Your people from Homeworld Security asked me questions about the Lucian Alliance . I answered as best I could , and then ... Nothing . ( SCOFFS ) Nothing ? GINN : It 's strange . One moment I was answering questions , and the next thing I knew , I was sitting here . What happened ? Why didn 't I return to my own body ? Ginn , while you were connected to Dr. Perry , one of your people , Simeon , he killed you . And we received confirmation that Dr. Perry died on Earth as well . That can 't be true . Then , how am I still here ? Heya , T.J. You burning the midnight oil ? Well , since Rush broke Destiny 's master code , all these Ancient medical devices are now accessible to us , so I 'm kind of taking a crash course on them , although it would help if I were fluent in Ancient ... You okay ? Oh , yeah , I 'm feeling a little under the weather , trouble sleeping . I was wondering if you could give me something . A good night 's sleep would do me wonders . Yeah , yeah , sure , hang on . I got just the thing . Let 's see . Here . Just gonna take this , mix it with water , give it about a half hour or so and it 'll calm you down , - help you relax , and maybe ... - ( THUDDING ) It doesn 't make any sense . Well , obviously we don 't know as much about the stones as we thought . Look , Ginn was ... Ginn was murdered . So , therefore , the connection wasn 't properly severed with the communication device . Now perhaps her consciousness became displaced . Displaced ? Floating around , like a radio signal ? Chloe just happened to be the one to tune into it . SCOTT : But why her ? We 've had people on stone duty around the clock for days now . Why didn 't any of them connect with Ginn ? Well , perhaps because Chloe was the only one to fall asleep . Her consciousness relaxed just enough to allow an opening for a connection . Well , I don 't know , Colonel . It 's just conjecture at this point . I 'm sorry , but the bigger question here is , if Ginn is in Chloe 's body , whose body is Chloe connected to ? How long have you been feeling like this ? A few days now . " Few " meaning ... A week , maybe two . ( AIR RELEASING ) Maybe a month . Your blood pressure 's high . 176 over 110 . I used to take blood pressure pills . Hypertension . I ran out shortly after we got to Destiny . Why didn 't you tell me ? Well , there 's nothing you could do about it . It 's not like you could write me another prescription . No , I have medicinals that could help . Tea leaves have been effective in improving circulation ... T.J. , I was feeling fine . I didn 't think it was a problem . Hypertension is often symptomless but dangerous . Didn 't your doctor tell you this ? Okay . Look , one of these Ancient machines is used for diagnostics , including blood work , so I 'm going to run a few tests . I just think a good night 's sleep is all I 'm going to need . Probably . Let 's just be sure , okay ? Nothing . So , whoever Chloe is connected to , they 're definitely not on Earth . VOLKER : Wow , look at that face . That can only mean good news , right ? May I come in ? Yeah . Your kidneys are failing . End-stage renal disease . All of them ? Kidney disease tends to attack both kidneys at the same time . Okay . Okay , can we do anything ? Any of your medicinals ... No . The problem with kidney disease is , by the time you have symptoms , it 's already too far advanced . On Earth , the next step would be dialysis . Um ... The machines in the infirmary , do any of them ... No . I already checked . It 's mostly testing equipment , some devices for use during surgery , but nothing for dialysis . The only other option for treatment would be a transplant . GINN : Rush killed him ? Chased him halfway across a desert planet . I wanted to go , too , but ... No , I 'm glad you didn 't . I 'd hate to see you get hurt . Hey , I wasn 't going to get hurt . I was just so ... I had to do something . You know , after what he did , I wasn 't ... Whoa , no ... It 's just ... I 'm sorry . I ... No . No , no , no , no , no , no . It 's okay . Believe me , there 's nothing more I want to do right now than kiss you . What 's going to happen to me ? Is there any way that I can get back into my own body ? After you ... The next planet we stopped at , it was beautiful . We buried your body there . Had a memorial service . It was ... Then , where will I return to ? I don 't know . I mean , we don 't even know who Chloe is connected to on the other end , if she 's safe . I 've been trying to remember more , but I just can 't ... ( GASPING ) What ? What 's wrong ? Ginn ? Ginn ! ( CHOKING ) Help ! Somebody help ! Hey , hey ... ( COUGHING ) ( HYPERVENTILATING ) You all right ? What just happened ? I don 't know . I 'll be right back . As far as I can tell , there 's nothing physically wrong with her . So , do you have any idea what caused it ? I have no idea . It was weird . We were just talking and then suddenly , she was choking . No reason . Ginn was strangled by Simeon . Now , brain function is really just a series of electrical signals . Energy which is no doubt the foundation of how the stones work . Now , she was murdered before she was disconnected . So , what , the energy was disrupted , resulting in some kind of glitch that made her replay the event ? Do you think we should disconnect the stone ? If we disconnect , who knows what 'll happen to Ginn ? We may not be able to get her back . Eli , if she has another attack , Chloe could be harmed . But T.J. just said there 's nothing physically wrong with her . I just think that we should study this , see if there 's some way that we can save Ginn without harming either of them . RUSH : I agree . It warrants further study . All right , well , let 's go ahead . We 'll keep an eye on her . Hopefully , this is a one-time event . Sir , there 's something else I need to talk to you about . Transplant ? How soon ? As soon as possible . Well , we can 't connect to Earth , so using the stones to bring a doctor onboard is out of the question . Yes , sir . Given the obvious limitations of this ship , is that type of surgery even possible here ? We have access to more Ancient devices as well as a pretty extensive medical database since Rush cracked the code . YOUNG : Anything in there about organ transplants ? JOHANSEN : ( EXHALES ) Probably , I don 't know . I 've just begun to search through it all . All right , well , sounds like you 've got to get back at it . Sir , listen , in order to do this procedure , we 're going to need a compatible donor . Well , you have the records of everybody 's blood type . We 're also going to need to tissue-type to get a thorough match . - Okay . - It 's going to be extremely difficult . There 's not that many people on board this ship . To get an adequate match , it 's a long shot at best . T.J. , let 's just ... First things first . Start testing . Let 's see if this is even possible . - Yes , sir . - Okay . ( SIGHS ) SCOTT : T. J ? JOHANSEN : Oh , hey , thanks for coming . I cross-checked blood types . There 's 18 people on board the ship who are compatible with Dr. Volker . Among them are you two . It 's not too complicated . I just need to draw some blood if that 's okay . Let 's do it . You first ? I 'm a Marine . We 're always first . ( JOHANSEN CHUCKLES ) So , what are the chances of getting a good match here ? Well , it 's a matter of degrees . We 're looking for certain genetic markers on white blood cells . No one on board the ship is related to him , so that rules out the best possible match , but hopefully we can find one close enough that warrants doing the transplant . T.J. , you 're gonna be okay . You can do this . Yeah , piece of cake . How 's it going ? Well , Rush has some ideas , but we 're still working on it . How are you doing ? I feel different . It 's not like the last time I used the communication stones . Well , what 's different ? I mean , aside from the choking part . Something just doesn 't feel right . We 're gonna figure out what 's going on here . I promise . I 'm not gonna lose you again . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) - I heard about Dr. Volker . - Yeah , tough break . You know , this surgery is fraught with danger , - even in the best of circumstances ... - Are you compatible ? - Sorry ? - Your blood type . Are you compatible ? No . I 'm just checking . Go on . Look , I don 't want to lose anyone on this ship , Colonel , but the fact is , a transplant risks not just one life , but two . I 'm not just gonna sit back and let the man die without at least trying to figure out something . ELI : T.J. , we need you in Ginn 's quarters , now ! ( GINN GASPING ) - JOHANSEN : I 'm on my way . - Hurry ! ( CHOKING ) Eli , what 's happening to me ? Ginn ... No . Help me . Chloe ? - JOHANSEN : Chloe ? - No , Ginn . - What happened ? - You had another choking attack . You switched with Chloe for a minute there . Look , when you switched with her , where did you go ? - Was there anyone else there with you ? - GINN : No . I don 't ... I remember not being able to breathe , and then I woke up here just now . - Colonel ? - Yeah . I checked with Corporal Barnes . The connection wasn 't cut at any time . YOUNG : Really ? Then how was Chloe able to switch back with her ? See , I don 't believe that Chloe is connected with anyone at the other end . I believe her consciousness has been in her own body the entire time . Suppressed by Ginn 's ? How is that possible ? I don 't know . I 'll have to further study the communication device . - We should pull the stone . - RUSH : No , no , no . We have to find out why this is happening first . - Not at the risk of Chloe 's life , Rush ... - This is crucial for understanding - how these communication stones work . - Figure it out , okay ? Because the next time she has an attack , I 'm going to pull the stone . - No , no , you can 't ... - No hesitation . - I don 't want to hurt Chloe . - Yeah , I know . I know you don 't . I agree with Colonel Young . If I start choking again , disconnect me . Hopefully we find a solution before then . - GINN : Solution ? - To the situation . - Chloe ? - What 's going on here ? Is it you ? Yes . Matt , what happened ? Ginn connected with you when you used the communication stones . Ginn ? Well , I thought ... I thought she was dead . - Are you okay ? - Yes , I 'm fine . Corporal Barnes , did you just disconnect the stones ? BARNES : No , sir . Still active . What do you mean ? She 's still connected to me ? Do you feel any different ? Can you sense someone else , you know , inside your brain ? What ? - Ginn ? - Yes . Oh , man , this is nuts . What happened ? You switched with Chloe for a moment there . SCOTT : Wait a minute , you don 't remember it ? No . It 's all so strange . I feel weaker . Here , sit down . I 'm sorry , can you just excuse us a second here ? Okay ? Eli ? Hey . What ? ( STAMMERING ) I don 't know . I mean , we can 't be sure of anything until ... Eli ... Her energy might be decaying . The radio signal getting weaker , harder to keep tuned in . Matt , even without disconnecting the communication stone , we might not have much time before we lose Ginn completely . How 's that translation program working for you ? Good . A lot of information here . Some good stuff about organ transplants . Hey , you see this ? According to the database , it 's a kind of a ligature device . Cuts and cauterizes at the same time ? I thought it did something like that , but I could never get it to work . Hey , T.J. , there 's a whole section here on stem cell-like procedure for post-op anti-rejection . It 's only 176 pages . A little light afternoon reading . Still a lot of other potential post-operative drawbacks . Infection , high blood pressure , erectile dysfunction ... ( ALL SNICKERING ) ( LAUGHING ) - Why is that funny ? - ( ALL LAUGHING ) After everything that 's happened recently , we can 't be sure this thing 's even working properly anymore . What is it you 're trying to do ? We 're trying to see if there 's a way we can intercept Ginn 's signal and download it into the ship 's memory banks . YOUNG : Okay , then what ? What is she ? She 's just another program in the ship 's computer ? Well , she 'd be preserved , for the time being , until we can determine the viability of downloading her consciousness into another body . JOHANSEN : Colonel ? T. J ? JOHANSEN : We have a match . Two , actually . Tissue-typing takes a look at six specific antigens in the blood of the recipient and the donor . The best compatibility , obviously , is a six-antigen match . It happens most often in families . The two of you , you both have a four-antigen match with Dr. Volker , which is surprisingly good , considering . The equipment that you used , how accurate is it ? - Because I want to make sure ... - I 'll do it . Sergeant , listen to me . There are a lot of risks involved in this procedure , and you don 't have to decide right this instant . - Think it over . - GREER : No need , sir . I 'm good to go , Lieutenant . The Ancients wrote about a procedure to eliminate post-operative rejection of transplanted organs . It involves removing bone marrow stem cells from the donor prior to surgery , and then implanting them into the recipient at the time of the transplant . It produces a state called mixed chimerism , which is basically an immune system that blends elements of both the recipient and the donor . You need some bone marrow . So , go ahead and take it . Okay . I can give you something to put you to sleep during the procedure . Don 't worry about it . We 're short on meds . You don 't need to waste any . It 's really painful , Ron . It requires sticking a large-bore needle into your hip bone . The pressure ... The sooner you do it , the sooner it gets done . All right . I 'm going to need you to lay on your stomach . - VOLKER : Thank you . - No big deal . Well , yes , it is . It 's a very big deal . You 'd do the same thing for me . ( EXHALES ) Okay . I 'm going to need you to hold really still . Ready ? ( SCREAMING IN AGONY ) ( CHUCKLING ) That was a joke . Just kidding ... Okay , well , knock it off . Okay , okay . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) The Colonel said you and Dr. Rush were working on something with the communication device ? Yeah , no luck . Okay , so what 's next ? We 're kind of running out of time here . - Matt ? - Chloe ? She 's switching back and forth more frequently now . SCOTT : How you feeling ? Weird . Tired . This whole thing 's affecting both of them . Am I still connected to Ginn ? - Yeah . - SCOTT : But Rush is working on it . We 're gonna figure this out . Is she all right ? ELI : Yeah . Well , she 's fading . We 're trying to figure out a way to preserve her consciousness without harming you . I 'm fine . Don 't worry about me . Do what you need to do to help her . No , not at the risk of hurting you . I won 't let that happen . No one will let that happen . Did we switch again ? Ginn . ( EXHALES ) I 'm sorry , will you excuse us a second ? Look , how long is this gonna go on ? - She hasn 't had another choking episode . - Yet . Why risk it ? Look , man , I know you miss her . I know how much it hurt to lose her . This isn 't about me , Matt . I 'm trying to save two people ... What 's going on here ? Chloe ? No . Amanda Perry . Mandy ? Yes , Nick . It 's me . I wondered if you were in there , if there was any chance that you survived . We think Dr. Perry has been in there the whole time , but both she and Ginn are fading . Chloe 's becoming more prominent now . We 're going to have to act fast on this , Colonel , otherwise we 're going to lose both of them . Amanda 's consciousness is already far weaker than the other two . All right . Well , do we have any solutions yet ? Well , I 've had no luck with the communications device , but I do have another idea . The neural interface chair . Now , I believe with that , we can isolate each consciousness and upload them into Destiny 's memory bank . Like Franklin . Wait , like what ? I 've seen and spoken to Dr. Franklin many times now on the bridge . So that 's what happened to him ? He was uploaded to the ship ? Well , I can 't say for certain , but I do know that Destiny has a neural link with the people on board this ship . It 's caused us to see things before . Are you seeing him now ? No . I managed to sever the link shortly after your experience with the alien battle simulations . Always the chair with you . Well , you asked for a solution . Well , it didn 't work the first time when Chloe was becoming an alien . Yeah , this is different . I know what we 're dealing with here . - So there 's no danger to Chloe at all ? - I didn 't say that ! Did I say that ? I 'm going to have to remove some of the safeguards I put into the chair 's programming , yes , but I 've done the calculations . The chances of her being harmed are minimal . Colonel , this is not our decision to make . You know , guys , I 've got to go stretch my legs . - I 'll be back in a couple of minutes , okay ? - Yeah . I have never liked hospitals or doctors . Well , this is not a hospital and T.J. is no doctor , so you 're fine . Thanks , that 's comforting . Mmm-hmm . All things considered , though , I wouldn 't want to be anywhere else . - I hear that . - Yeah , I miss home . Sitting in the backyard , warm summer night , sippin ' a beer , staring at the stars through my telescope , you know . I love that backyard . All right . You sure ? Yeah , I don 't want to disconnect the stone and risk losing them forever . We need to do this . Whatever it takes to help them . Okay . Hey , T.J. , I just stopped by the infirmary . Volker looks worse . I know he and Greer are ready to do this . I know you 're scared . This is a major surgery . It is complicated , and it 's dangerous . And if you do nothing , Volker dies . I do the surgery , and they both could die . That is a risk that both men have accepted . Listen to me . I 'm not gonna order you to do this because you know that it needs to be done , and you know that you are the only person who can do it . It 's not permanent , Mandy , but my hope is to find a way of putting you into another body . A fresh start . That 's been my dream ever since the accident . Where 'd they go ? Who ? Oh ! Wow . This place has really filled out . As close to a backyard as we 're gonna find on this ship . You and me ? We 're gonna be fine . You can trust that . JOHANSEN : Greer , where the hell are you ? Took a little walk , T.J. Gettin ' some fresh air . Is Volker with you ? Yes , I am . ( 2001 : A SPACE OD YSSEYTHEME PLAYING ) I thought a little music might help you relax . The theme to 2001 ? Ah ! It 's not very relaxing , is it ? No . ( LIVE YOUR LIFEPLAYING ) ( MUSIC STOPS ) You ready ? How will I exist ? You 'll live inside Destiny 's computer system . You 'll be a part of the ship . Literally . And when I 'm switched off , what will happen to me then ? Now , that can 't happen . The only thing that we can switch on and off is the ability to communicate with you . Remember , this is only temporary . The SGC knows of alien races with the ability to download a consciousness into a host body . Hell , the Ancient database may even have information on it . We just need to find it and figure out a way to do it here , on the ship . I know it isn 't perfect , but we can be together . Just to see you , talk to you , hear your voice . It can be enough . Can 't it ? ( CHOKING ) Ginn ? BRODY : Okay , right there , that 's the lumbar vein coming off the back of the renal vein . You want to cut that . JOHANSEN : Okay , got it . YOUNG : T.J. , have you started the surgery yet ? Yes , sir , about 30 minutes ago . - Ginn had another choking attack . - JOHANSEN : Is she all right ? Yeah , she 's okay . It passed , but I 'm not waiting any longer . We 've got to do the transfer now . JOHANSEN : I 'm going to be here another four or five hours , sir . I can 't leave . All right , well , keep going . We 'll manage . Copy . Go ahead . Okay . Ready ? Get the retractors , please ? I want you to pull up . All right , I 'm reading two energy signatures , each separate from Chloe 's . Now , are we sure that that one 's Chloe 's ? Well , it appears to be the dominant presence , so I think we can safely assume that it 's Chloe . I 'm transferring the other two . ( CHOKING ) - She 's choking again ! - Turn it off . I can 't , the transfer 's already begun . ( GASPING ) ( POWER SURGING ) ( RUMBLING ) ( GASPING ) - What happened ? - BRODY : I don 't know . Destiny 's mainframe just had a huge power surge . We lost imaging , database , everything . ( GASPS ) What 's happening ? Must have been some kind of power surge . Is it still transferring ? I don 't know . The mainframe is inaccessible . - Anything ? - No , it 's crashed . - JAMES : Why ? - I don 't know ! - What , did you fix it ? - RUSH : No . The ship must have overcome the problem . At least partially , at any rate . There 's still several systems malfunctioning . Well , can you turn the chair off now ? Yeah , but I can 't be sure the transfer 's been ... I don 't care . Turn the chair off now . We don 't have time ! I need to finish this ! Hang on . I think I 've got the ligature device back online . The database is still down . PERRY : Tamara ? JOHANSEN : Who are you ? - What ? - I 'm Amanda Perry . - Dr. Perry , how did you ... - No time to explain . You need to finish the surgery . - T.J. , what 's wrong ? - You 're not real . PERRY : Listen to me . I 'll help you . I have access to the entire medical database . Trust me , Tamara . I can help . - Okay , tell me what to do . - Who are you talking to ? No one . I 'll tell you later . - T. J ... - JOHANSEN : I 'm fine ! Just let me do this . Go . All right , the first connection you need to make is to the renal vein . Attach it to the external iliac vein . - Did it transfer ? - Yeah , I believe so . Two new programs have suddenly appeared in Destiny 's memory bank . One of them , in fact , is active somewhere on the ship right now . Doing what ? Okay , the artery 's attached . Go ahead and unclamp it . It 's pink . That 's good . That 's it . You did it . - Chloe ? - Yeah . I 'm all right . Okay ... Okay . So far , so good . I started the stem cell infusions . Over time we 'll wean him off of it as he reaches a chimeric state , but hopefully his body won 't reject the kidney . - We just have to wait and see . - He won 't reject it . Great , no pressure . Hey , you did good . BARNES : Colonel Young ? - Yeah , go ahead . - I need you in the Communications Lab . - David ? - Yeah , it 's me . We just made the connection . We had a problem with the communication device on our end . Took a few days , but our guys finally fixed it . David ... The bomb was defused . Washington is safe . PERRY : Nicholas ... It worked . Thank you . How do you feel ? Free . Have you peed yet ? What kind of question is that ? Well , the kidneys clean the blood , they process the waste ... No , I know what they do , for ... Yes . I 've ... Yes , okay ? - Good . - Good . Hey , you need to walk , just a little bit around the infirmary . Helps the body heal . Oh , I gotta go . I 'm on duty . I 'll stop by later . - I 'll help you . - ( CHUCKLES ) - Are you sure ? - Mmm-hmm . All right . There might be a little infection setting in there . I 'm fine . Yeah . No , I know . Just gonna change the dressing . I was getting worried . I saw your consciousness in the memory bank , but you hadn 't appeared to anyone yet , so I didn 't know what to think . I know it 's only temporary . It is . I promise , but for now , it 's the best we can do . I 've thought about what you said . Just being here , seeing you , hearing your voice ... It is enough .

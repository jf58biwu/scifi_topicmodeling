 [ Reporter ] Representatives of a Trans-Atlantic , are declining Comment at this time . Beyond the statement issued Thursday morning Indicating that human error is not responsible for the spil . But with Increasing pressure from both law makes and activists ... What the hell is this mess ? Sir , Herodotus has reached and impact point . Alright Vitale . Patch 'em in . Herodotus ? Come in . This is Smith . Quinn ? You there ? Roger that Smith . Alright . We are deep 8 . On the floor . Go to line C double E. What 's up ? Let me know if you see anything , Well-different . Something tells me we are not looking for a rupture in the main line . Really Quinn , I don 't know what the hell I 'm looking for . Well then I 'm sure I 'll find it . Captain . Well hold on there Smith . What do you see ? We are going through a debri field . Lots of sediment . There is a lot of kick up . Hold on just a sec . Sonar reading is showing a field of 10 miles . And ? It goes deep . Well how deep ? We 're on the floor already . Something must be off . This can 't be correct . Smith ? [ Static ] [ Static ] Quinn ? Quinn you there ? [ Static ] [ Static - Quinn on Radio ] Smith ? Can you hear me ? - Hello , can you read me ? - Hello ? Contact , Contact . - Is everything ok down there ? What the hell do you suppose we should do now ? This is Herodotus , can you read me ? Hello ? Jennifer ? Quinn ? Can you read me for Christ sakes ! Dammit ! Great . Now we 're alone . In the dark now . What about the manual pulsar ? We 're at the bottom of the ocean . [ Low Deep Noise ] A Whale ? Hold on . Ma 'am . I 'm getting a different heat reading coming in . It 's one giant mass . Let 's get out of here . - I need a heading full power . Get us out of here now ! - Alright . Roger that ! Let 's go ! [ Screaming ] Quinn ? Can you read me for Christ sakes ! Dammit ! Maybe the lost power . It 's too late for maybes . Look , I know that there 's a lot going on but we have the press in room 3 . I don 't give a damn about the press . I need to know . Is this an accident ? Of course this was an accident . That was a 15 million dollar machine down there . And 2 operators unaccounted for . What would you tell the press ? Understood . [ Rumble ] I 'm fine . I 'm fine . What the hell is wrong with this rig ? I don 't know . Maybe we 've hit a rack . [ Rumble ] Alright . Alright . Go get an operator . Move ! Move ! Go ! [ Growl ] Jesus . Mary and Joseph . No no no ! [ Explosion ] [ Crowd Cheering / Horns ] [ Crowd Cheering / Horns ] Admiral . Admiral . We 've lost an oil rig Sir . What the hell you mean we 've lost another oil rig ? Sir , I know as crazy as it sounds but we cross checked this with NOAA and NASA And we checked the Doppler rating every 30 seconds and - Take that damn thing away . You don 't need to watch a YouTube video to know that 40 thousand ton rig doesn 't vanish of the Gulf of Mexico . You 're worse then my grandchildren . Yes Sir . This is it ? Where 's everybody ? It 's Mardi Gras Sir . All the streets are shut down . Don 't get a halo for Christ sake . I had to . As well did I. Well then , let 's talk about something that matters . Yes Sir . I won 't take this personally but quite frankly I think it 's all bull myself . Satellite goes down . Oil rig vanishes . Shocker . What if it is something else ? An explosion would have registered on seismic readings . Not to mentions higher Elevations of carbon monoxide and smoke . Which would have visible for miles . Well I 'm glad to see NASA take an interest in this . I already have enough beads . And you are ? Dr. Margaret Adams operations Bureau Chief NASA . This is specialist Stone . Sir . Oh yes of course . Project Armada . We felt that this would be a good opportunity to move project Armada into it 's 1st live field test . WE as in the rest of NASA ? Most of us . Pretty big step for a radar glitch . You have anymore information you want to tell me ? We don 't believe the rig disappeared . We believe it was scuttled . Ok . Dr. Adams , is it ? Yes . Ok , you don 't scuttle a rig . You scuttle a ship . Exactly . We 've done the recon . It wasn 't a computer glitch . The rig is gone . So what do you propose ? Deep-sea dive . Deep-sea dive ? Are you serious ? That area in the gulf is 800 Fathoms deep . We 're talking about bottom Of the ocean floor deep . Are these suits pressurized ? They have been tested at 400 Fathoms . No breakage . Computer simulation shows we can go another 1,000 . You understand that there is a big difference between what goes on in the simulator and What takes place in reality , correct ? Alright , we send in a mini . We did . Ok , and what did it find out ? We lost contact with it . 15 minutes it into the dive . 15 minutes . Are these M bot pilots ready ? Gearing up as we speak awaiting orders . I know this cat in water is a bit of a loose cannon . And why do you continue to allow him in the program Admiral it 's beyond me . He was the 1st one to sign up and he passed all the tests . He is a reckless liability . Yes . But he 's the best we 've got . He 's on board with the program , he won 't be any trouble . Is he training ? As we speak . [ Crowed Cheering ] * Singing " 99 bottles of beer on the wall " * Babe , we got to get back to base . Base base base . You know what base I 'd like to do to you ? Yeah , can you give me that for 50 ? Yeah , not the shwag though . Some of that Cali Kush . You really know how to treat a lady . [ Mumbling drunk ] Squid . Yeah dude . What ? Let me call you back . What did you say ? You heard me . Red . No no no no . It 's all cool . I just wanted to make sure I heard him right . - Don 't do this . - Squid ? Let me just tell you something . I 'll kick your ass so fast , you won 't know what hit you bro . Yo ! Settle down alright . Yo back up bitch ! Don 't touch her ! No you 're not going anywhere . Bitch ! [ Cell Ringing ] Yes . Yes Sir . Copy that . We gotta be on deck in 10 minutes . Alright . Have a nice day ladies . Who 's a bitch now ? [ Spits ] Whoo ! Damn , What time is it ? Jimmy . Go go go go go . Glad you love birds can make it . Wouldn 't miss it for the world . Yeah you should have come . Did ya 'll know they us at 800 Fathoms . Did you drink at Mardi Gras ? Doctor you know we don 't drink . We had like 2 beers 3 hours ago . Why the rush ? Because there is a search and rescue . For what ? Oil rig . Wait . We 're missing an Oil rig ? How-How do you loose and oil rig ? I don 't know but we 're about to find out . How many where on board ? It 's not looking good . About 172 . Are we cleared for 800 Fathoms ? Now . Sims we hit about 134 . Yeah that reassuring ... [ Sigh ] Aah . See you on the bots bitches . You good ? Yeah . You ? I 'm good . You sure ? Yeah . I 'm fine . Hey base , this is Red one . I am settling into the bot . Activating blue bot . Activating sonar . Boarded . Sonar . I 'm going to warm things up . Setting coms . Coms are good . Command center this is pilot Blue . Commencing launch sequences . Gage . Go . Full power . I 'm alive . All systems are go . Looks like everything is looking good . The bots are ready to be dropped . Here comes the Admiral . Well , magnificent Doctor Adams . Excuse me Admiral ? Such a show . Hardly . Of course it 's a show and I have front row seats . You took the opportunity of a search and rescue mission ad turn it into a show case For some very expensive toys . We are all on the same team here . I 'm trying to find the rig , maybe some survivors . I don 't know what you expect to find down there Doctor but My team is not expendable . Is that understood ? I have been with project Armada since Inception . They are my team too . Good . Alright . Check out this dive . Olympic winner here baby . Hey Tracy . You ready to get wet ? So mature . [ Laughs ] Ready to get dropped . Let go . It 's always a hard hit . Red how you doing ? Now toasty , how about you sweetie ? I 'm getting hotter and hotter . 5 Fathoms . 10 . [ Sigh ] How you guys doing down there ? I 'm done on this side . You can flip me over . It 's oven hot . I mean lava . Can I get some air in here please ? Ok . The pressure is increasing . We are approaching 100 Fathoms . Approaching 150 Fathoms . 150 . You guys it 's getting really hot in here . Approaching 192 Fathoms . 200 fathoms . 250 . Geez . Psi 250 . 260 Sir . What 's going on guys ? Something doesn 't feel right . We are approaching 400 Fathoms . Something is wrong . Something is wrong . Her bot 's go out . Tracy . Copy . Base ! My bot deactivated . You cool Tracy ? [ Beeping ] Tracy ! You alright ? Too far to bank . I can 't breath . It 's heating up in there . What 's the issue ? Loose cords appearing to have some type of electrical surge . She 's gonna loose all oxygen . Mayday Mayday I can 't breath ! Sit tight . Sit tight . We are restarting you . Keep calm everything will be just fine . Power cycle it . We can 't cycle it at these depths . Lieutenant Hendrix . Nothing . Base . What 's wrong with her bot ? Get her damn bot back up . [ Beeping ] Tracy . Base ! Get her fixed up now ! Her bot is failing ! She 'll be back in 3 ... 2 ... 1 . [ Sigh ] She 's back . You back on . You good ? You good ? Back in business baby . Whoo ! She 's back on . Close call . She was never in any real danger . [ Under his breath ] Thank god . Thank god . We are approaching 500 Fathoms . Come on you guys . You cannot have that type of stuff happening down here . Ok pilots . Your barometers read that you still have another , 700 feet to go before you Reach the ocean floor . When you do , your systems computer will sync with the ship . So you 'll have our sonar readings . How you doing down there ? Snug ? As a bug Admiral . Outstanding . [ Sigh ] Approaching 600 Fathoms . It is super hot . And the pressure is increasing exponentially . Yeah , my ears keep popping . 727 Fathoms . Approaching the bottom . So once we get down there , Any great ideas on how we 're suppose to go looking For this great missing oil rig ? They are approaching the ocean floor . Whoo ! We just hit the bottom . They 've reached the bottom . Ok . Take position 5 . 25 degrees from each other . Position 5 in place . Initializing gyroscopic equilibrium . Reactive matrix online . Image and data recruiters up and running . Activating external lights now . External lights . Whoo . You guys picking this up ? Whoo . What happened down here ? Oh my god . That a hell of a lot of damage . My god . It 's a ship graveyard down here . Whatever happened , I don 't think they ever saw it coming . I 've never seen something like this before . Damn Base , there is a lot of wreckage here . This place got torn to shreds . Unbelievable . I 've dived damn near 100 dives and seen countless pictures of others And believe me when I tell you this , I 've never have seen anything like this before . Earthquake maybe ? Missed by every seismic monitoring station on the east coast ? Then some underwater phenomenon then . What kind of phenomenon ? I don 't know Sir . Well that 's no damn help , is it ? Understood Sir . Run the growbo . See if you can detect any variance in pressure . The bot scanners are not showing any anomalies . That 's so bazaar . Tectonics look normal . Nothing is out of the ordinary . Bull bitter . I have seen enough damage in my lifetime to know when it 's intentional and when It 's natural . Get on the horn . Get me subs . Carries and Destroyers out here on the Double . And find me Geise . Yes Sir . Who would take down an oil rig ? That 's a damn good question doctor . And one I hope to find an answer to . Whoo ! Heads up . We got a bogie . Incoming Incoming . I 'm picking it up on sonar . Copy that . I got the bogie too . I 'm not sure what it is but it looks pretty big . It 's getting closer . Do you see what I 'm seeing . It 's something on my monitors . Do you see what I am seeing ? Holy crap ! What the hell is that ? I have no idea but it 's big . It 's enormous . What the hell is it ? I need subs . I need carriers . Fighter and destroyers . And get me Geise ! What is that ? Coming closer and closer . Base you seeing this ? What is that ? This is not a vessel . [ Screams ] It 's a whale ! It 's a whale ! Holy ! [ Sigh ] Just a Whale . Jesus . Scared the hell out of me . A whale . Who would have ever thought . Oh ! Look at his head ! Sir , I just got off the horn and everything you requested it 's on it 's way Sir . - Well get back on the horn and tell them send everything else . - Yes Sir . There 's something else . Yeah . I 'm getting something too . What is this on our sonar ? It looks like a mermaid . Holy crap ! Did you see that ? Oh my god . What was that ? It look like some sort of I-I - I don 't know what the hell I just seen . I guarantee that 's what brought down that oil rig . I 'm going after it guys . No no no Tracy . We don 't know what that thing is . I can catch up with it . Do not pursue . We have it on sonar . We 'll track it . I 'm on it , . I 'm closing in . That 's our only defense . Do not put the bots in danger . They 're still in pursuit . Do not pursue . I repeat do not pursue . Come on Jimmy boy let 's do this . Come on . Come on . I don 't think this is a good time to be doing all that . Not now . Alright , well do what you want . I 'm going after it man . Alrighty then . Right behind you .

You got a shot , you do you take it baby , take it ! Firing Harpoon . I got this . I got this . I got this . Got dammit Red , I just had that shot . It just disappeared from my sonar . I don 't have anything here . Anybody else reading anything ? [ Sigh ] Screw it , I 'm still going after him . I 'm bring this fish in . Do not pursue . That 's a direct order . You had your chance and you blew it . It ain 't too late . It 's never too late . I 'm going to get it . Remote trigger that thing . Shut them down . - Sir , if that thing reaches the coast people are gonna die . - Do it ! What just happened ? What ? Are you kidding me ? Power off . Why ? Power is off . Bots are down . No . Only two bots are down . Red must be out of range . Out of range ? What kind of remote you got in that damn thing ? Maybe he 'll catch up to it before it hits land ? He 's headed for the coast . The entire world is about to learn about project Armada . Never mind . Call out the entire fleet . Get the a battaly the marines up and ready to be Deployed on the east coast . I have a damn feeling we are gonna need them . Send in the seals . Send in the green berets . You need to send everybody . Come on . Come on ! Red bot is about to come ashore .

I 'm a little sick Sir , Red and Tracy are gonna handle that for me . I see . Sorry to hear that you are a little under the weather . Need some help ? When I was young I did some field work at the DRC . It changed my life . Crap . Here comes ... Admiral . You 're need back in the base . You need to come with me please . We 're sick . It 's ok . I can handle this . Admiral , have you ever heard of project Tortus . Yeah , that 's the experimental sonar that detects fossilized deposits under the Sea . It 's a banning jurisdiction . That 's right . Only that 's just the beginning . You Se 4 years ago sonar also discovered something else under the sea bed of the coast Of Yemen and the Gulf . Let me guess . Yes . I read those reports , there 's nothing to indicate - And there won 't be . For Obvious reasons . Geise , I have the highest clearance in command , what are you saying to me ? I 'm telling you they shut the program down . They privatized the commission ... They went dark . However , we did manage to get some samples . DNA matching . Ect . And ? When we discovered that these things are 100s of millions of years old . I mean hell , they gestate for thousands of years just laying their eggs in crude oil . Crude oil ? Yes Sir . Crude Oil . Salt Water . And the natural thermal vents underneath the crust is What it 's needed for these eggs to survive . How many eggs are there ? 2 . That we know of . Do we know where the other egg is ? Yes Sir we do . Nothing but water and air . Sir . Doppler . Radar . Do you have anything on your screen ? Beautiful winters night . Yeah . Awax ? We have 5 in the theater . Awax . 2 destroyers , and no SEG . How about Sub ? Anything from Lionfish ? At depth . In position . Surveying . Everything looks calm . USS Wasp . This is Lionfish Charlie . 2 - 7 over . Lionfish , this is USS Wasp . Ask him what 's going on . What 's going on ? Over . We have a 38 degree drop of pressure from the northeast to be at Yankee Rhino . Over . Can you confirm that . I don 't see it . Charlie 2 . 7 . This is Captain Dager . We are not seeing that on our screens down here . Send us the coordinates . Stand by . We are now confirming a large mass rising from the ocean floor . Collect that information . Send it Intel . Contact command and see if they are picking This up too . Charlie 2.7. be advised that we are forwarding your Intel to command . Over . Sir , some major activity coming from the outside - [ Static ] Lionfish ? Charlie 2.7. come in . Lionfish . Charlie 2.7 . Restate your position . Charlie 2.7. come in . Captain . I 've lost contact with Lionfish . Try another frequency . [ Crash / Alarm Beeping ] General quarters . General quarters . All man your battle stations . [ Explosion ] What ? Oh my god . Yes . I copy that . Copy . Admiral . We just lost the USS Wasp . We lost transmission 13 minutes ago . Sir ? Get Geise on the on the horn . Tell 'em we are too late . It hatched . [ Roaring ] [ Heavy stomping Roaring ] Like I 'm playing myself . You 're know for playing your self . Got me . So when you gonna let me get you again ? Did you feel that ? We should check on Red . He 's in the brig . That 's on the other side of the base . Whoa ! Alright . Let 's go ! Hey Hey ! You guys hearing this ? [ Growling ] Hey ! You hearing this ? Hey ! Hey hey hey ! You hearing this ? Hey man , calm down in there . [ Banging on door ] Let me out ! Let me out ! Hey ! Hey !

I can fire a weapon . I can help defuse it . Believe it or not , Airman , there are other trained professionals out there that know how to Do their job . This is not the Garret Water show . My name is Red . Oh , just sit tight Red . Don 't touch me you punk . Dammit ! Wait . Do you know where they saw it ? They said near the Brig at the other side of the base .

[ Clears throat ] Well , we um - Hold that thought . [ Cell Ringing ] Yo . We gotta go . Now ! Now ! You got this ? Thanks . Admiral . Well the dinosaur is continuing north . All under sea . Where 's the president ? He 's already been informed and is on his way . Good . Also , the national guard has been deployed . We are just trying to figure out where this damn thing is gonna surface for air . What about the nuclear option Admiral ? Don 't be so god damn trigger happy Geise . Margaret , the pilots are entering the facility now . What is the status of the bots ? Red suit has sub stained some minor damage . No functionality has been lost But it took a little beating . A few digs . The damage is minor . It 's not a problem . Understood . What 's going on ? One of those monster has broken onto the surface . I have direct orders from the Admiral to move to phase 2 . This halo , it 's an experimental interface designed along the side of your training . It will link with your central nervous system inside the Armada suit . It will grant you greater response time , control , and agility while piloting . Is that safe ? It 's only one way to find out . Now , You may experience some discomfort . At least initially . But as your central nervous system acclimates to the intrusion . Moving inside Your Armada suit will feel like just like moving your actual body . You will begin to sense what it sense . And react to stimuli as Alacrity as your actual response times . And how much faster is your response time to the actual bot . Your response time will be exactly like your body . As fast as you can think , that bot will move . - Say wor . - Wor . So , Who 's up 1st ? You kidding me ? Let 's rock . Ok guys . Remember what I talked about . The initial integration . You 're going to feel a pinch . So get ready for it . Alright ? Stay calm inside your gear . We 're gonna go in 3 . 2 . 1 . Go . [ Scream / Groan ] Oh my god ! Aah !

You guys getting integrated into this well . Yes . Admiral ? Get the robots ready . Yes . We are picking up something on sonar . Ok guys . Training is over . What 's going on ? Creature has landed in Manhattan . Let 's go . This might be a funny question but uh-How do I get to New York in this thing ? Fly . Fly ? Fly . Just got word from Admiral Hadly , the creature is at the coast . Man , I thought we 've to be waiting around for a while . I 'm glad you all find this so exciting . Oooohhh ! You better believe it Jimmy boy . Cut the chatter you two . We have a job to do . Admiral the bots are not prepared to handle this type of thing . We got tho give them time to do their job Geise . General Banning is ready to nuk these things now . Oh I 'll talk to General Banning , You can 't just throw down a nuk on Manhattan and pretend it 's over . It 's not . [ Street Performer Signing ] Ladies and Gentlemen . Ladies and Gentlemen . Get out now ! Get out ! Get out ! Death is coming . [ Growl ] [ Screaming ] [ Gunshots ] [ Growling / Stomping ] Move ! Admiral . - The creature just landed . - Yeah . We see it . Admiral . We need to position the USS Virginia right away . Stone , what is the ETA on the pilots ? 25 minutes .

Is it Lieutenant ? Now we 'll see if 10 years and 500 billion dollars is worth it 's research . What actually really worth it . You better hope so , Alright guys , you are approaching the target . [ Roar ] Approaching target zone . Holy crap ! Did you see the size of that thing ? Oh my god , he 's killing the city guys . All your systems are operational . You care cleared for weapons hot . Yes Ma 'am ! I 'm on your 3 . Roger that . I 'm on your 3 . Climbing up 22 degrees . Climbing 22 degrees . Admiral It 's - It 's bigger then anything we 've seen before . Unfortunately it looks like there are a lot of civilians on the streets still . Well we should prepare a bomber just in case . Stand down Geise I 'm fully aware of your recommendation , but if you want to stay in my war room I suggest you keep your clam shut . Capisce . Understood . Sir . It 's me . We 're not getting no play here . The Admiral is going to loose New York one way or the other . I think it 's time we implement the Trojan horse . Yes sir . It 's massive . It 's 3 times . 4 times bigger then the other one yo ! Stay focused . Whoo ! I think I can smell it 's stank as breath from here . Yeah ! Nothing is working . Nothing is penetrating . Dammit . I 'm out . Are you kidding me ? Did the city get evac ? No Admiral . The bridge just got too tangled . Mom you need to get out of there . Get dad . Get everyone . Everyone is gonna die .

We got no options . [ Growling ] There you go . You wanna rock ? Huh ? Huh ? Come on . Come on . Get in there ! [ Roaring ] Ah ! [ Grunt ] I think we have a problem you guys . [ Heavy Breathing ] I felt that . I can feel the pain in the suit . What did he mean by pain in the suit ? It 's an off shoot from the bio mechanic Admiral . The suit absorbs shocks , mass interferences , tactile controls . Is it simulated ? It 's pressurized and within the suit combined with the exoskeleton mechanics It should be enough to protect the pilots . So , what are you saying here that if the suit gets hurt , the pilot gets hurt ? Yes . But on a minimum level and the pilots are safe . Has this been tested ? It hasn 't been field tested . [ Laughing ] - Beat that you son of a bitch ! - They got it . They got it . They got it . They got it . Come on ! Get back up ! What 's a matter with you . Come on Red you are tougher then that . [ Roar ] Red , Are you Ok ? I don 't know how much more I can take of this . Red ! Man up ! Let 's go ! [ Clears Throat ] You boys done ? Sorry mommy . Alright , that 's what I thought . Don 't give me any sas . Has the target been neutralized ? I 'm certain Admiral . What is their fuel ? They 're at 40 % . 40 % . Alright guys your fuel is running low . We burned up most of our fuel just getting here . Ok guys we never had a chance to go over this but you 'll find a control panel on your left Gyroscope . It is your may wep . Your may lay weapons activation panel , press it now . Near the left gyroscope . Copy that . Oh ! Whoa ! I got a war hammer . I 'm ready ! Nice . Hey Blue , how you liking that sword there .

Absolutely Consider it done . Yes sir . USS Virginia prepared for launch . Geise ! [ Mouths ] Get over here . Who the hell are you talking to ? I um-That was General banning Admiral . The USS Virginia is in theater and we need to act now . We have to nuk these things . That is a bad Idea . That is not out call sir . Are our troops still engaging the enemy ? Until there are no more options . Well then you get back on the horn and you tell him that I 'll Have that them in 30 minutes . Sir , I don 't think we have that kind of time . The bots will be directly in the line of fire . God dammit Geise we gotta give them a chance to do the job . Admiral . The USS Virginia has been cleared nuks hot . I see the creature on my radar . What 's the plan now ? What are we doing ? Some jackass just ordered a nuclear strike . So if you can 't kill it , Get the hell outta there . We need to stop that nuk . Oh my god . I have family in New York . I 'm gonna fly and intercept the missile . Use my jamming device to stop the detonation ... What is the elevation detonation . For the missile ? That nuk is going to detonate . At an elevation of 550 meter . It will be there in less then 5 minutes . Alright then there is no time to waste . [ Roar ] Aah ! Aah ! You gonna pay for that one . Take this . [ Roaring ] How am I looking ? Interception in 2 minutes . Listen Red it 's gonna be super super close . I won 't like it any other way . Come on baby . Come on . Come on . Aah !

I 'm not gonna ask you again . What the hell is going on here ? Well Geise , I see you 've officially lost your mind . Shut up Admiral . This is about National Security . Don 't talk to me about national Security . This is above the ambition of weak and selfish men , Geise . Nothing more . Look we couldn 't shut them down if we wanted to . They are too far out of range . Don 't give me that . So call a dron . I tell you what . I 'm gonna give you till the count of 5 . Then I 'm going to shoot the Admiral . Go right ahead . You think I 'm scared of a little coward like you ? 5 . Ever shoot a man Sheldon ? 4 . You know what the secret is to shutting somebody ? Sheldon . 3 . Never hesitate . You son of a bitch . [ Groans ] Well , that didn 't go exactly as planned on my mind . Admiral , we got to get you to a hospital . Negative . It 's just a flesh wound . I 'm not going anywhere until my pilots are successful . Good work Wexler . Admiral [ Mumbling ] You should have dropped the nuk . You don 't know what your doing . How they doing ? Not so good . [ Roar ] [ Grunts ] Take that . Come on . You don 't have no more . Tracy ! Tracy ! Status on blue ? 11 % and dropping . It seems like the Nero feedback has become to great . She must be disconnected soon . If she 's not disconnected what does that mean ? She 's gonna die . I 'm getting on a chopper . I 'm going after her . Margaret , what 's the status on Tracy ? Tracy . Come to baby . Come to . You alright ? Jim , we need you to take Tracy to safety . Listen to me . Her Neuro feedback has become too great . It 's gonna be alright . I got you . Get that halo off her . I 'm gonna taking this thing to space and I 'm going to blow this nuk up . [ Grunts / Groans ] Ok let 's go . You and I. Red core is failing . Oh god . Alright . Red . Red .

 NARRATOR : Previously on Fringe ... You nearly died when you were a boy . I became consumed with saving you . Walter , I don 't remember any of that . OBSERVER : There is more than one of everything . I have said too much . I am not supposed to get involved . What did you people do to us ? Of the children Bell and I experimented on you were the first to identify things from the other side . Was it me who described it as a glimmer ? I 've never met anyone who can do the things that you do . I 'll go get my coat . Please don 't tell him . [ WALTER TALKING INDISTINCTLY ] WALTER : - Serve as an example of our ability to achieve that which most can 't even imagine . But what you must understand is that as scientists we must embrace every possibility . No limitations . No boundaries . There is no reason for them . Gentlemen , I would like you to take a look at this . It 's a mobile telephone . Can be made much smaller , I assure you . MAN : Does this work ? - Not here . Not yet . This phone is digital , not analog . It 'll take us 30 years to get up to speed . I didn 't invent it . I wish I had . Dr. Bishop , we were under the impression Dr. Bell would be here . I 'm afraid that 's not possible . Dr. Bell is in Europe . But I am here , so I can answer any questions you may have . - Dr. Bishop , is this Russian technology ? WALTER : It is not . It is quite American but it is technology from another universe . An alternate universe just like ours , but more advanced in some areas . Are you suggesting you somehow visited this alternate universe and acquired this technology ? - No . It is theoretically impossible to go there . Then how did you come to possess this ? I copied it . For the last several years , William and I have been conducting experiments regarding this other universe . So based on our findings , we developed a window of sorts a way of looking in to this neighboring world . And that is why we are asking for funding . - This is my colleague , Dr. Carla Warren . - Hello , sirs . This window works by capturing errant photons from the universe beside ours . The window essentially stretches the membrane between our worlds and allows us to see their image from our side . You 're gonna make some sort of alternate Manhattan appear ? It 's already there , General Hayes . Dr. Warren . At all times . Right in front of our eyes . We just can 't see it . I 'm sure you know that the original purpose of the so-called observation deck of the Empire State Building was to be a docking station . For zeppelins , of course . Gentlemen , you are looking through a window into another world . Walter , what are you doing here ? You left me no choice . You wouldn 't answer your telephone or return my messages . I tried to communicate . Well , I need time , okay ? I don 't even know how to begin to work this out . I think I do . Please , Olivia . I need to explain . If you wouldn 't mind , I could use a sip of something myself . Have you told Agent Broyles ? No . But to be honest , that doesn 't mean that I won 't . I always knew that one day I 'd have to pay the price for my deception . Well , we 're not really sure what the cost is yet , are we ? No , I suppose not . I invented this after William and I learned that we had doubles on the other side . Or maybe it was before . I can 't remember . It 's a window to the other universe . I was a different man then . I was going to change the world . But , you see , after Peter became sick none of that seemed to matter anymore . The illness was genetic . Savage . Wasting . I tried everything . There was simply no hope . At least not on this side . But over there , they were more technologically advanced . If the alternate Peter was also sick , over there then wouldn 't his father be equally motivated to find a cure ? He was . God help me . He was . Any progress ? He 's synthesizing a new compound now . He 's using cobalt and magnesium . Any idea yet how he 's selecting the filtering compounds ? Random , I think . Chance . Fate . Luck of the draw . I 've given him a name , Carla : Walternate . This should be the reaction . No cure . Perhaps with a higher iodine purification . [ PHONE RINGING ] - Walter Bishop . WOMAN [ OVER PHONE ] : Walter . Elizabeth . Is he ... ? Yeah , no , he 's fine . He 's all right right now . What ? I think you should come home now , Walter . I think it 's time you came home . Okay . Okay . He looks worse . He keeps asking for you . It 's not like before . What is it like ? It 's different . He keeps saying he wants to talk to you . He says he 's worried he won 't be able to ... [ OPERA MUSIC PLAYING ] I just can 't bear it when you 're not here . You know what I 'm doing . You know where I am . Twenty-four hours a day , seven days a week . - Yes . - I won 't give up , Elizabeth . I can do this . I need you not to doubt me . You 're supposed to be getting some rest , my son . Look , Dad . I 've almost got it . Oh . Let me show you . Now : Slowly . Watch . One finger at a time . Let me show you . [ WALTER CHUCKLES ] Very good . I want you to have it . My lucky silver dollar . If I die . Peter . It 's okay . I 'm not scared . Nothing is going to happen to you . I promise . You 're going to be just fine . Okay ? Now , get some rest . - Okay ? - Okay . Will you wake me for dinner ? I don 't wanna miss it . You 're not gonna miss anything . You know how much William wanted to be here . What with the meetings in Berlin ... I don 't need to tell you how important they are for both of you . He wanted me to make sure that you know how terrible he feels . Yes . I understand . I 'm glad you came . [ SIGHS ] We didn 't give him a good life . We didn 't . He practically never got out of the house . - He was always too sick . - He didn 't go to a proper school . He didn 't have any proper friends . He had no family but us . We kept him so well we never let anyone else get to know him . We did the best we could . We dealt with what we were given . He knew he was loved . Didn 't he ? [ ELIZABETH GASPS ] Walter , what 's wrong ? You 're cold . Have you been outside ? Come with me . What all is this ? How is this possible ? How are you doing this ? What I 've been working on , Elizabeth . It 's a window to another universe like ours , but different . [ SWITCH CLICKS ] Please . Please turn it back on again . Please turn it on . I want to see him again . Elizabeth , I 'm showing you this because I want you to know that somewhere Peter will grow up , somewhere he will lead a proper life . Somewhere he will be happy . But just not here . And that we must take comfort in this . And we must begin to move on . [ CLATTERING ] WALTER : The compounds you 're using for the cure . Not random at all . You are very , very smart . [ INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE ] Yes ! You did it ! My God , you did it . Ha . No . No , no . You had it . The cure . All you have to do is stabilize the compound , and you can save him . You can save him . [ GRUNTS ] MAN 1 : Their theories are fascinating . MAN 2 : They are not theories . They are entertainment . I have made a mistake . So I 've heard . What were you doing in the lab ? Dr. Bishop was on the verge of developing a cure for the boy . It was an important moment . He discovered me . There was no other way to witness the moment . You have changed the future . You have created a new set of probabilities . But you must agree the moment was significant . The boy is significant . You need to take action to restore balance . How ? You will have an opportunity to fix this . - Walter ? - Dr. Warren . - Have you been here all night ? - I 've been working . - Working on what ? - This . - What is this ? - Walternate found a cure . He found a cure for Peter . And it worked , Carla . It 's not too late . I can save him . Walter , Peter is dead . I know . Of course I know that . I 'm not talking about my Peter . I 'm talking about the other Peter . The one on the other side . He missed it . The other Walter . He missed it , you know . It was right there , in front of him , and he didn 't see it . - He was distracted by the man . - What man ? The man in the lab . He was distracted and when he returned , the positive result had failed and so he moved on . Maybe he 'll realize what he missed and go back . Carla , he 's just like me . I wouldn 't look back , and neither will he . He didn 't see the compound , but I did . And I 've reproduced it . It just needed minor modification . Without this , Peter will die . He 'll die all over again , which is why I have to go over there . What ? The Casimir effect should produce a thinner more porous region of space-time . I only need to affect the area for long enough to cross over to the other side with a vial of the cure . And then , of course , re-create the effect to cross back again . Walter , you 're trying to create a wormhole into another universe ? Yes , I think I just said that . Where 's my map ? When I looked into his room on the other side I saw that his mother had already packed his suitcase for our lake house . Just like we do every year at this time . That 's where we need to find a location to set up . Walter , I 'm sorry , but you can 't . Yes , yes . I think I can . No , Walter . I mean you can 't . Shattering the wall between universes would rupture constants of nature . - We don 't know that to be true . It 's why we 've been lying to the military , telling them it 's impossible . There has to be a line somewhere . There has to be a line we can 't cross . I had always considered you as a scientist , Dr. Warren despite your personal needs for religious claptrap . I see I was wrong . " I am become death , the destroyer of worlds . " Don 't you quote Oppenheimer to me ... " Knowledge can 't be pursued without morality . " I may go to church , but I also have three degrees in theoretical physics and I am telling you you cannot do this . We both know the amount of energy required to create a portal will forever ruin both universes . For the sake of one life , you will destroy the world . Some things are not ours to tamper with . Some things are God 's . My son is dying , Dr. Warren . I will not allow that to happen again . There 's only room for one God in this lab , and it 's not yours . The lake . It 's perfect . The water will absorb the excess energy . I won 't be needing your assistance any further , Dr. Warren . - Walter ... - That will be all . [ FOOTSTEPS RETREATING ] [ DOOR OPENS ] NINA : Walter 's always been like that . He often goes off on flights of fancy . Even if he was serious the design is decades beyond anything we could imagine . CARLA : You don 't understand . He already has the design . He 's building it . NINA : Oh . Yes , Dr. Bell 's room please . [ PANTING ] Here . Here will do . [ GRUNTING ] [ MOTOR REVVING ] [ DEVICE ACTIVATING ] See you 've changed your mind , Carla . Good . I 'm sorry , Walter . You disappoint me , Dr. Warren . Go home , Nina . There 's work to be done here . NINA : Walter , don 't do this . WALTER : I 'll be there and back before you know it . NINA : That 's not the point . We both know there 's more to it than that . WALTER : I don 't mean to say that creating a doorway between the universes is trivial I 'm simply suggesting ... If William were here ... If William were here , he 'd be applauding . - That 's not true . - No ? - Why isn 't he here ? - The funding , his schedule ... He 's in Europe chasing funding ? Too busy to come and stop me from destroying the universe ? How many times have you rang him today ? Once ? Twenty ? How many times has he returned your call ? Do you know how many times William 's encouraged me to take this very risk ? To expedite our espionage program ? " Why simply take a peek into the other universe , Walter when you can go there ? " Till now , he couldn 't make me find a way to try to get there . Until I had to find a way . - I don 't believe that . - No , you wouldn 't . Because you don 't understand him . Like everyone else you 're blinded by the charming manner , the air of intelligence . The whole damn show . All William Bell ever cared about was finding a way to increase the power and the wealth and the legend of William Bell . Walter , regardless of what William wants or who he is I know why you 're doing this . I understand . You know how much Peter meant to me . And how difficult it will be for me to admit that he 's gone . But this this isn 't the answer . WALTER : No . I won 't let him die again . [ DEVICE HUMMING ] No , Walter , I won 't let you do it . Walter . NINA : Uhn . Uhn . CARLA : Nina . Help me ! Oh , no . Oh , no . ELIZABETH : Hey . You 're supposed to be getting some rest . Look . I 've almost got it . Okay , let 's take a look . [ ELIZABETH CHUCKLES ] I 'm gonna show you , okay . It 's like this . Okay , slowly . One finger at a time . Okay . Slowly . Two . Three . Good job . Okay . All right , love . Now sleep , okay ? - Mom ? I want you to have it . - Mm-hm . - What , darling ? - My lucky silver dollar . Okay . I want you to have it . If I die . - Sweetheart ... - It 's okay . I 'm not scared . Listen . Nothing is going to happen to you . I promise . You 're gonna be fine . You just need to get some rest now , okay ? Okay . Good night . Dad ? Hello , son . Dad are you all right ? Yes . Yes . ELIZABETH : Baby , who are you talking to ? Walter ? How ... ? What are you doing here ? I thought you were working late at Cambridge . I ... Walter , what are you wearing ? Where 'd you get that coat ? I think I 've found a cure . What ? I think I found it . A cure for him . - Are you certain ? - Yes , I believe so . I need to take him back to Cambridge . To the lab . We have to leave now . Yes . Yeah , of course . Um ... Right , Peter , darling , get up . We 're gonna get you dressed . Darling , let 's get you out of this . Okay . Good boy . Okay , let 's go . There 's a good chap . All right . Darling , we have to go to Daddy 's work . - Elizabeth , may I have a word , please ? ELIZABETH : Mm-hm ? Yeah , of course . Put those on . - What is it ? - I think you should stay here . - What ? - The cure , there 's still testing to be done . It could take all night to find the right dosage . - Well , I can pack a bag . - No . You haven 't slept in weeks . If it works , there could be many days and weeks of recuperation . Peter will need you . He 'll need you to be strong . - Walter ... - No ... - I 'm fine . - Please , Liz . I need you not to doubt me . Okay . Okay . - Oh , God , he 's burning up . - We should leave . ELIZABETH : You take this for luck . - I love you very much . - Me too , Mom . I 'm going to be waiting for you right here , okay ? Okay . Go . Bring him back to me . I promise . [ DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES ] WALTER : Are you warm enough ? - I 'm cold . - Me too . Just a little farther . Where are we going ? Why aren 't we taking the car ? We can 't get where we 're going in a car . You 're not my father , are you ? Of course I am . Who else would I be ? And I 'm going to make you all better . Hold on tight , son . We did it . [ ICE CRACKING ] Is he okay ? - Who are you ? - Who are you ? - You 're the man I saw ... - You 're the man I saw in the lab on the other side . ... in the lab on the other side . Your friend and the one who was injured . They left to seek medical attention . He won 't live much longer . You must fix him . Your lab is six miles from here . Can you drive ? I think so . Why ? Why did you save us ? The boy is important . He has to live . I just got off with the hospital . Dr. Bell called in a team of specialists . He has some thoughts on Nina 's arm . Thank you for coming in to help with Peter . - After all that happened . - Of course , Walter . - He looks better . - Yes , he 's getting his color back . Seems to be working . You 're going to return him . Yes . Once he 's stabilized . Good . - I 'd like to go now . - Of course . Thank you . ELIZABETH : Walter . You didn 't come home last night . I was worried about you . I thought ... How ? He was dying , Elizabeth . This is the boy I showed you . The other Peter . It was the only way I could save him . Oh , God . Oh , my baby . Oh , my baby . Elizabeth , don 't . He 's not ours . I have to take him back . WALTER : And I realized at that moment that despite what I 'd promised what I fully intended to do that I could never take Peter back . The way she looked at him I saw in her what I feared most in myself when I saw him : That I couldn 't lose him again . It was the first hole , Olivia . The first breach . The first crack in a pattern of cracks , spaces between the worlds and it 's my fault . You can 't imagine what it 's like to lose a child . [ ENGLISH - US - SDH ] Ripped by stlc8tr

 13 Bannerman Road is where Sarah Jane Smith lives . And it 's home to things way beyond your imagination . There 's an extra-terrestrial super computer in the wall . Her , son a genetically-engineered boy genius . A schoolgirl investigator across the road . And a whole universe of adventure , right here on the doorstep . Ready ? Always . This is a time window . Find the objects and they will bring you home . Is this Buckingham Palace ? 'Tis the tower of London . What are you looking at ? Germans . I see it , you 're right . I 'm not a spirit . Ta-da . Eight o 'clock , that 's it . Good morning . That must be what that junk shop bloke 's after . It 's coming from in there . If Sarah Jane and her friends do not return soon they 'll be trapped in the past . And she dies ... tonight . Get after them ! Los ! Los ! Nazis are right behind me . Right , nice one ! Let 's get help ! 'Ben , it 's locked . ' ' Let me try . ' It 's horrible . It 's exactly how my mother died . It 's over now . It 's all over . But why did it stop so suddenly ? I guess because that 's where it ends for those children . Matilda ! No ! Lady Matilda ? No ! Get away from her ! Lady Rani , be careful ! MATILDA SHOUTS Hold still ! I will not hesitate to use this ! Are you all right ? I am fine , thank you . And you have just saved my life . What is all this commotion ? Matilda just tried to kill Lady Jane ! A treacherous Catholic ? I am no Catholic . I am a Protestant . One of my own ? Then why ? Your death would have inspired thousands to rise up against Mary . And now she will simply lock you up . Then , one day , she will have you quietly executed , when you could have died a martyr . That 's it . The object that 's changing history . But you weren 't supposed to die tonight . I saved you . That 's what I was sent here to do . Lady Jane has not been saved . You have condemned her to die , like a common traitor . Forgotten and alone . It brought it all back to me , hearing those children . It must have been like that for Mother . I know what you went through , Emily , I know what you 're going through . I lost both my parents when I was very young . You understand then , that if I 'd found ghosts here , I 'd know also that Mother was out there somewhere . Yes , but you have to live in the here and now . Oh , you 're lucky , because there 's someone here and now , who loves you . Your father . I know . The here and now . But we must help those children . I couldn 't save Mother , but there 's got to some way we can save them . Trouble is , it 's all over now . But remember , it happens every night at eight o 'clock . We 'll have to come back tomorrow . Not necessarily . Think about this house , Emily . It 's empty ... The clock ! So we can make it happen ? Let 's see , shall we ? CLOCK CHIMES It 's going to begin again , isn 't it ? It has to . We can 't help those children unless we understand . DOOR OPENS I 'm so sorry I 'm late , Mrs Bruce . Look , Sarah Jane , you did it ! We can see her now ! See you about half eleven . The echoes of the future must be getting stronger . Hello ? Can you hear me ? I 've got to get back to the church . I need that hammer . Why 's it so important ? Anyway , you can get it when the Home Guard nobble the Jerries . Good golly , young man ! Look where you 're going . George ? Well , am I glad to see you , Miss . Three Germans ! At the church ! Who 's this ? Miss Wyckham , our teacher . They held us hostage but we escaped . We have to inform the Home Guard . They 've been captured too , and the whole of Little Malding ! Really ? Everyone in the village ? How many Germans are there , then ? Dozens ! The place is surrounded , but I managed to slip through . We can 't go anywhere near the village . Then what now ? We must all go back to St Michael 's . She 's right . We 're the only ones who can stop the Nazis now and their radio thingy . But they 're all armed , remember ? Yes , George ... and so are we . PLANE FLIES OVERHEAD I am afraid of what the morning may bring . I fear I do not have long for this world . Forgive me , but I feel so alone . You 're not alone , Lady Jane , remember . You have me . Has Lady Matilda been secured ? Yes , Jane , but so have we . The palace is surrounded by Mary 's guards . Then I was right , the end is not far off . This is so unfair ! Can 't we tell them , tell Mary that you were used ? You didn 't want to be Queen ! I fear Mary still sees Jane as a threat . If she is to restore the Catholic faith , she will not want Jane fuelling the Protestant cause . You may go now and try to get to safety . Somehow I knew , when Father brought me here to be crowned that I would not leave . This castle was my palace , but now it is my prison . As I am no longer Queen , you may return home , if you wish . You 're right , I could go home so easily . I 'm not going to . Not yet . Not while you still need a friend . NO ! She must not delay ! PARROT SQUAWKS The Sands of Time have run out , Captain ! They have failed in their missions ! All is lost ! But the Time Window should have closed ! The Chronosteen must be holding it open ! And unless it is found , the whole planet will be sucked in and destroyed ! Come on , Sarah Jane ! Yes , but I can 't come out , Joe , not tonight , it 's impossible . You know I 've got to look after Ben and Katy . Yeah , I know but ... Yeah , all right , just chill out . OK , I 'll slip out . Where shall we meet you ? She must be the babysitter . And not a very trustworthy one it seems . So she 's from the future ? Goodness . She 's got funny clothes , just like you . And what 's that she 's talking into ? It 's a mobile telephone . I knew Mr Bell 's invention would catch on . But a wireless telephone ? The future must be very exciting . No , those two will be fine . I 've locked their bedroom door . Keep ' em out of trouble . Anyway , they 'll be asleep soon . CHILDREN LAUGH You two ! Go to sleep ! It 's still not here . What 's not here ? This object I 'm looking for . There 's still upstairs . Then it 's got to be there , otherwise Earth 's future is in serious trouble . Listen to me . When the Jerries have their backs to the door , give me a signal , I 'll burst in , you two bring up the rear . Understood ? Good luck , Miss . This is our chance . ( Now ! ) Right you lot , put your hands up ! Good going , Miss . What a star ! Quite right . The star of the Fuhrer 's conquering army . Welcome back , schwein ! I was sent here , on a mission . On a mission to save me ? I only wish ... that I could really save you , from what 's to come . But I can 't , can I ? We each have a path that we must tread , and this is mine . All I hope is that I will be remembered even though I was Queen just nine days . Of course you 're remembered . I mean , will be remembered . For hundreds of years to come . You say that with such strange certainty , Lady Rani . That 's cos it 's true . How is it you seem so wise ? Is there something you are not telling me ? Are you truly of this world ? Don 't be daft , course I am . Whoever you are , wherever you are from , I would not wish to spend these last hours of freedom with anyone else . Koenig , what is the matter with you ? How could you let them escape ? She was lying about everything , about the village , the Home Guard . Definitely what that shop bloke 's after . Perhaps I can kill two birds with one stone . If you 're planning another escape , don 't bother . Within the hour the German invasion will be underway . Invasion ? What are you talking about ? I wasn 't posted to this dreary village at random . Little Malding 's coastline is dotted with early-warning radar . They have proved irritatingly successful at alerting the enemy to our aircraft and ships . But we can render the entire system useless , with our Sieg Transmitter . So that thing blocks British radar ? Right now the glorious German fleet is preparing to depart harbours all along the Dutch and Belgian coast . Your so-called British Intelligence will not suspect until it is far too late . We know . Clyde and me . And what can two schoolboys do ? You 'd be surprised . I 've taken on bigger loonies than you lot . I 've fought hideous , bug-eyed monsters . And defeated them all , with this ! What is that ? Oh , this , this is a bomb . A very small bomb , but powerful enough to blast this entire church ! He 's bluffing ! It can 't be ! Do you really want to take that chance ? Here you go ... catch ! I 've got it ! It was a trick ! Give that to me ! Get back ! Or we 'll smash it . People like you disgust me . You hate and you fear anyone who isn 't the same as you . But we 're British and we will fight you every step of the way . And in the end , though it 'll cost lives , lots of lives , we 'll crush you lot . You don 't stand a chance . Really ? But remember , you 've lost this battle , and you 'll lose the war . I know ... I 've seen it . Loess ! Open the door now ! Make like it 's Sunday , Georgie ! BELLS CHIME OUT It 's over , Koenig ! Come on ! The children 's room . But that door 's different . It 's got to be what the shopkeeper was after . So he must have sent me to the wrong time . But why ? Maybe you came to meet me . Well , I 'm certainly glad I did . So that key is in the future ? And the door is still open in our time ? Precisely . Which means ... we can walk straight through it . Amazing ! Ben , don 't ! You mustn 't ! You know what Mum told us . Shut up , Katy ! It 's only a candle ! Please don 't ! So he starts the fire . And they 've been locked in here . How can we help them ? I 'm thinking , I 'm racking my brain . Ben ! You 'll start a fire . I can 't stand it ! They heard me ! But how ? They 're at a completely different point in time . I 'm telling Gemma ! I was thinking about the night Mother died , and then I felt it , just for a moment . I 'm sure I crossed over into their time . Your fear , it must be connecting to theirs ! Ben , it 's locked ! Let me try . Oh , if you can cross over , you can turn your fear into a force for good ! Come on ! Ben , we 're trapped ! Ben , we 're trapped ! Concentrate on that terrible night . It 'll save them . Come on , Emily . Remember your mum , Emily . Your fear will connect you . Yes ! It worked ! We did it ! We saved them ! No , Emily , you saved them . And your mother would be very , very proud of you . How do I look ? Most becoming , my lady . I wish to be prepared . But promise me you will leave soon . It 's too dangerous here . I said I 'd stay by your side , and I meant it . But they will arrest you too . Don 't worry about me , I can look after myself . I 'm so sorry , Jane . Queen Mary has ordered you be taken to the Keep , to await trial . You must come now . Do not fret , Ellen . I have done my living , and I am ready for something far more important . I may go to my death , but it will not be in vain . Tell me again that I am not forgotten . I promise you . Not by your people , and not by history , and never by me . Goodbye , Rani . My friend . It is time for me to leave you now . And me to leave you . Goodbye , Jane . 'Tis witchcraft ! Lady Rani is not of this world , but she is no witch , Ellen . She is an angel . I have always suspected so . And as angels speak only the truth , I know I do not die in vain . BELLS PEAL They 'll probably be back at the beach by now . I hope they don 't get away after all we 've done . The Home Guard will catch ' em , you can bet your life on that . You 're right , Clyde , what you said to them Jerries . We will crush ' em . I 'm going to join up and help do it myself . That 's not what I meant , George . I don 't want you to fight . It 's dangerous out there . It 's my duty , for King and Country . At least leave it a few years . 1945 , to be precise . Not likely . I 'm going to get stuck in , soon as they let me . Just you wait and see . Right , you wait for the Home Guard . Keep the door locked though , in case the Jerries come back . And where are you going ? Back to where I came from , I hope . London ? But what about the bombing ? It 's not the London you 're thinking of . Look , I can 't explain . Good luck though , Georgie-boy . And if you do sign up , please , be careful . Well , stone me ! Come on ! Come on ! THEY GASP Yep , all in one piece . Please , let me have the Chronosteen ! And I 'm loving the new look . What is happening here ? And where 's Sarah Jane ? She 's still in the past . And without her the Earth is doomed ! Do you think my father will believe that I 've travelled in time ? Not everyone 's as open to new ideas as us . But at least you two you 'll be talking , sharing things , and ... not dwelling on what 's gone and can 't come back . Yes , it 's the here and now that counts , you were right . Though the future does sound exciting . The future 's got its problems too . Talking of which . Emily , I need that key . Thank you . What 's happening ? I 'm going back , to my own time . I 'm sorry , but this is goodbye . But I don 't want you to go ! I want you here ! I want to learn more ! You will , all by yourself . Please , let go ! Oh , Sarah Jane , I 'm sorry . Rani , Clyde , you 're OK ! Where is the Chronosteen , Miss Smith ? The key ! I need the third object ! I 'm so sorry , but I lost it . Send me , I 'll get it back ! The Time Window is too dangerous now . Only the key can close it . And it must be closed ! There must be something we can do ! It 's too late ! The Earth is about to be sucked into the Time Vortex ! We 've got to stop it ! BELL RINGS Are you Sarah Jane Smith ? I 've been asked to give you ... this . SARAH JANE GASPS We did it ! The Time Window 's shut ! Indeed you did . How marvellous ! Where are you going ? Now , that would be telling . The Captain 's work is done here , which is all you need to know . I 'd love to stay and chat , but , well , duty calls . 'The Captain 's work ' ? We 've been working for a flippin ' parrot ? THEY LAUGH But who were they anyway ? Uh ... I don 't think they wanted us to know . Can 't stick these enigmatic types . Well , I was warned to expect some strange things . And I must say , Miss Smith , you do not disappoint . Well , welcome to my world . And thank you , Miss ... Morris ? Angela Pryce . Emily Morris was my grandmother . Oh , good on Emily . She came through in the end . When I was a little girl , Granny gave me that key , said she 'd made a terrible mistake by taking it , and told me to bring it to the place in this article , on this very day . She said I 'd meet a woman called Sarah Jane Smith . It 's been quite a wait . A lifetime or two , in fact . You and your granny have just saved the world . Oh ! So , what happened to Emily ? She became a doctor , then founded a hospital for children . She inspired so many to follow in her footsteps , including my mother and me . We loved her very much . Let 's get a cuppa , shall we , Angela ? I want to hear lots more about your grandmother , and you . That 's a ... nice dress . Oi ! BELL RINGS WHOOSHING SOUNDS " Following his triumph as an evacuee in Norfolk , George Woods " joined the Army , aged just 16 , and fought in the Battle of Ardennes . " But it 's for his work in the field of radar development that George , " now 83 , has been honoured this week by Her Majesty the Queen . " " And in the final hours before her execution , " Lady Jane wrote to her sister , Katherine , " I am touching my death , " but rejoice , good sister . " I shall be delivered of corruption . " And though I lose my mortal life , " I am assured that I win immortality . " What are you doing here ? Saving the world . She 's exactly like you ! What 's your name ? Ruby White . You used a bio-coolant spray on a meteor you couldn 't have known had fallen to Earth . Don 't think I haven 't met amateurs before . Rani , take that ! Whoa ! Get down ! Wait till you see what I 've got for you ! THEY COCK WEAPONS I 've got us killed . Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd E-mail subtitling @ bbc.co.uk

 Previously on Touch ... I got your files on a hard drive full of information waiting to be handed over to the police . Ms. Farington , we 've spotted Lucy Robbins ' vehicle . - I 'm sending Tanner . - No , that is really not necessary . I 'm still in complete control of the operation . - How should we proceed ? - Get rid of her . You said they found one body . Jake ! That means Amelia 's still out there . She 's alive . I put my money on Rigby . I should 've put it on you . The work we 're doing at the sleep clinic is extraordinary . You had one . We have six . And a seventh is arriving today . " The nest of seven . " Do you have any idea what that could mean ? And you scan their brain waves while they 're sleeping . It 's yielded an almost 90-digit sequence . The God Sequence . - I 'm in . - Welcome home , Calvin . He 's coming for us , Jake . He 's coming for you . He 's here . The killing 's over . No ! Jake , stop ! Jake ! I need to see you at the station tomorrow , 12 : 00 noon . Got any reservations , this too risky for you in any way , you let me know now . Let 's go . Trevor ... Thanks for getting back to me . Guillermo 's dead . You 're serious ? I was there . He 's gone . It 's over . The police were called . I couldn 't get Jake and Amelia out of there quick enough . The detective who 's investigating the murders at BreakWire , Detective Lange- - he was in charge . At first , I couldn 't believe my bad luck . And then I started thinking , no , this is what 's supposed to happen . I 've decided to tell him everything about Aster Corps , Amelia , Lucy , why Jake and I had to leave New York , go on the run , everything . I think this might be the police officer I 've been looking for . Trevor , I got to go . I 'll call you tomorrow . Hey , buddy . You can 't sleep ? Come on , I 'll read you a book . Jake ? Amelia ? My mom stood here . Yes , she did . She said my name . She cried . On this wall , your mother pinned up every piece of evidence she uncovered trying to find you . She never gave up . Never . I know . I never believed what I was told . Sweetheart . Shh . Don 't say a word . Both of you stay in this room . I 'll be right back . Jake , Amelia , we need to go out the back now , quickly . Let 's go . Follow me . Come on . Go , go , go . Nicole , we 've got a little bit of a problem . Uh-huh . There 's , um , been a little incident with Dr. McCormick . He was spotted Downtown by an old Marine buddy . Was there contact ? Yes , there was . Our-Our security team managed to get him out of there and back to the sleep center safely , but , uh , his friend , uh , got a little roughed up . Okay . Then be more careful , we have no problem . No , actually , we do . This buddy , this Marine- - Shane Stevens- - has now filed a missing persons report . I see . And he 's got a web site , and he 's posting flyers up all over town . And I 'm telling you , this guy is not going away . The patient furloughs have to stop . Well , we can 't have them feel as if they 're prisoners . We go into overdrive , work round the clock . We finish the sequence and be done with it . I don 't know if that 's possible . McCormick has regressed since the incident . He has not slept . - So up his dosage . - That 's not that simple . Side effects emerge . Th-The guy 's developed tremors . He 's showing signs of paranoia . Is he dying ? Well , not ... No ... of course he 's not dying . Well , then , the side effects are irrelevant . Just go back to work and finish the sequence and up his dosage . And double it if you have to . Uh , Liz ? Hi . It 's Dr. Linus . I need you to , uh , double the sleep medication for McCormick . Yes . I 'm sure . Avram ? Avram ? Martin Bohm , is that you ? Kids , get inside . Grab a seat . Avram , lock the door . We got to turn out all the lights . Two men with guns broke into the house . - Aster Corps . - Yeah . - Did they see where you went ? - I 'm not sure . We knew this might happen . Avram , does anybody else know about this address ? You are safe here . These two men were professionals . They came to kill me and take the children . I need to check the back . I am one of 36 people responsible for maintaining balance in the world . There are dangerous people trying to prevent that from happening . You children are okay , yes ? I 'm fine . So is Jake . Very well . We stay quiet and we wait . They are getting close ... but so am I. Amelia , grab your jacket . It 's on the couch by Jake . Avram , is that my car out front ? Yes . My cousin and his friends went to the duplex to retrieve your car and belongings . Tell them thank you , but we can 't stay here . I 'm going to talk to a detective . His name is Lange . I trust him . I 'm gonna tell him everything . Hey , buddy . " 3021 . " Perhaps we should figure out what this number means . I 'll keep an eye out for it . But right now , I 've got to go . Look , uh , please just watch Jake . Make sure he doesn 't leave the house until I get back . - Of course . - I should only be a few hours . Be safe , Martin Bohm . Thank you . Amelia , are you ready ? Yes . Okay , let 's go . Hey , buddy . We 'll be back in a little while , okay ? You told me to up McCormick 's dosage and now he 's unresponsive . What do you mean he 's unresponsive ? - We can 't lose him . - I administered 20 milligrams methylprednisolone ; No effect . 500 milligrams of adrenaline , now . Right away , doctor . Let 's go , let 's go , let 's go . Well , well , well , and there you are . My throat 's dr- - dry . That 's very good . Liz will get you some fluids . Right away , Liz . Get your electrolytes up . But you slept . And that is progress . Lift your head for me . There you go . Good job , Dr. McCormick . You should feel very proud of yourself . He 's all yours . I made you some food . It 's important to keep up your strength . You should eat . Jake ... where did you ... ? You took this from Guillermo ... The man who tried to kill you . Jacob , my boy , this amulet ... is a very important object . This symbol , the Tree of Life , represents how the universe came into being . The sacred and secret story of this amulet is that whosoever possesses it shall become the protector , the guardian of the Lamed Vav Zaddikim , the 36 righteous ones . Guillermo had this amulet . Yet , in his hands , this became an instrument of death . You took this amulet from him . Why ? Why would you do this ? " 3021 . " 3021 . That 's-that 's the number that you gave to your father . 3 + 2 + 1- - six . Six- - the number of love and healing . The six levels of healing . The sixth level is the working of miracles . Mir ... Miracle . Miracle . Miracles , healing . Jake , are we looking for a doctor ? A doctor . Adding your numbers of 3021 . Miracle . " Missing person file number 3021 . " Commander Robert McCormick . " The ' Miracle Surgeon . ' " saved the lives of five Marines in Afghanistan . " Oh , my . " Missing . Last seen in Los Angeles . " A name- - Private first class Shane Stevens- - is listed along with a phone number to call if anyone has any information . Jake , your father made it very clear we were to not leave this apartment . This man , Shane , he has been looking for the doctor for weeks . I-I believe that Dr. McCormick is one of the 36 and that he is in danger . Just like you , Jake . I believe that we are to find and protect this man . Perhaps by helping the doctor , we are also helping you . Yes , your father would understand this , yes ? Very good , Jake Bohm . We will do this . We will meet this Shane . We will commit ourselves to finding Dr. McCormick , a member of the 36 , and we will give him safe harbor . - Please have a seat here . - Thank you . Are you nervous ? A little . Me , too . Thank you for coming down . Just wait for me here , sweetheart . I 'll call you in a minute . Have a seat right there , please , Mr. Bishop . That 's not my name . Bishop . My name is Martin Bohm . I 'm wanted in the State of New York on one count of kidnapping . - And you 've come here to turn yourself in ? - No . I came here to clear my name . Last night two men broke into my home . Their intention was to kill me and kidnap my son . - Who were these men ? - They work for Aster Corps . Aster Corps the company ? Yes . I have an eyewitness who will corroborate everything I 'm about to tell you . Her name is Amelia Robbins , daughter of Lucy Robbins , who was murdered four days ago . And you 're saying these two men are responsible for her murder ? Well , I 'm not sure it 's the same two men , but I 'm absolutely certain Aster Corps had her killed . Her body was found 15 miles west of Newberry Springs in the middle of the Mojave Desert . I 'm sorry . I 'm confused . Why would they do that ? For years Aster Corps has had a secret research division run by Calvin Norburg . They 're set up to study advanced brain activity . They wanted Amelia as one of their subjects . So , 3 Â½ years ago , they kidnapped her and faked her death . They altered her autopsy report and her death certificate . They even gave her a new name : Adeline Danvers . That 's when they transferred her from New York to Los Angeles and began conducting experiments on her . On this flash drive I have evidence that will back up all of my accusations . Aster Corps is a $ 30 billion corporation . You realize that , right ? Yes . Look , I understand that everything that I 'm telling you sounds crazy , but I swear to you ... Every word of it 's true . And what proof do you have again ? The evidence on the flash drive- - Amelia 's testimony , her DNA . Also , you should question Tony Rigby . He headed up the division for Aster Corps . I 'll talk to the girl first . Thank you . Amelia ... right ? Come on in . - Joe . - Yeah ? Put out an APB on Tony Rigby . - Bring him in right away . - You got it . All right . Excuse me . Excuse me . Excuse me . Yeah , ticket to New York , one way . $ 417.62 . Doing a little sightseeing ? Yeah , this is Elite Bus Lines . I have a Homeland Security alert . This restaurant is owned by a friend of mine . We will be safe here , my boy . Are you Avram ? I am . I 'm Shane . Thank you so much for your call . I 've been searching for Dr. McCormick for weeks . I could use your help . We are glad to help . When I was in Afghanistan , Dr. McCormick , he was a battlefield surgeon . Five Marines were critically wounded by a roadside bomb . I was one of them . Dr. Mac , he , uh , he kept us all alive . Later , when I went to thank him for saving my life , he said it was nothing . " It was as if my hands were , were guided by God . " I 'm certain they were . Then you know the rest of the story . After his discharge , he came , he came home , he couldn 't sleep . He was agitated . He was no longer himself . And then , three months ago , he just vanished . I think his life is in danger . How do you know this ? Because I was Downtown . I saw him . I called his name . He turned , he saw me , I know he did . What happened ? This guy came and grabbed me , another guy joined him . Punched me , kicked me , told me never to return . I passed out . Before I did , I saw them take Dr. McCormick and put him in a van and drive away . This is terrible , my friend . I 'm not gonna give up . Tell me , how do you know Dr. Mac again ? In truth ... we do not . But , please , we were sent here to help you find him . Yeah . Yeah , I 'm sure you were . It 's nice talking to you . No , please , wait . Come , Jake . - Shane ! - Please , stop ! May I explain ? Why are you doing this ? Dr. McCormick 's in danger . I need to find him before it 's too late . And I don 't need anybody getting in my way . Shane , watch out ! Look both ways much ? Are you hurt ? When I was eight years old , my mom and dad took me to a board-and-care facility in New York where they had me do a lot of tests . Who exactly ? The man 's name was Dr. Teller , but he 's dead now . After a while , they told me that my mom and dad didn 't want me anymore and that I had to leave . That 's when they gave me my new name- - Adeline Danvers- - and flew me to Los Angeles where they started to do more tests on my brain . So how did you escape ? It 's all right , sweetheart . You can tell the detective everything . They murdered the woman that was taking care of me- - Frances . I watched her die . Then they drove me to a place in the desert where they continued to do experiments on me . That 's when Martin came and got me . He took me to my mother . My mom and I were on our way home when these men ran us off the road . And then they killed my mother . I miss her . Can I have some water ? I 'll get it . Here you go , sweetheart . My son Jake has a lot of the abilities that Amelia does , but he doesn 't speak . He uses numbers to communicate . He gave me this before I came here today . I 'm sure you don 't believe me , but I promise you , at , at some point today , that number will matter . Okay . Amelia , would you mind repeating all of this on a recorder ? I guess so . Okay how about we start with you telling me about this compound in the desert ? Tony Rigby . Freeze ! - Hands behind your back . - Okay , okay , okay , all right . Okay . I 'm gonna have the evidence on this flash drive analyzed , but I 'm gonna have to ask you not to leave town . And what about the outstanding warrant for my arrest in New York ? I 'll pretend you never told me that . And what now ? Until this case is resolved , you go and be with your son . Let 's go . Thank you . Thank you . I think it went so well . You were amazing . When you stood there , you looked at him , you told him the truth , it was ... it was great . Avram , it 's us . Avram . Stay right here . Avram ? Avram ? Jake ? Avram ? They 're gone . - Maybe they went for a walk . - No . I told Avram not to take Jake out of the house until I got back- - Come on . We shall return home , Jake . This will give us time to decide what our next course of action will be . What is this ? " If found , return to Randy Kitson . " There 's an address- - A marketplace on 3rd . Returning this may possibly lead us to the doctor , yes ? Then that is precisely what we will do , Jake Bohm . His name is Dr. Robert McCormick . This is the test subject you told me about ? Battlefield surgeon , brilliant . His scores are off the chart . So far what we 've seen is beyond our wildest dreams . Interesting . And how 's he coping with the process ? Uh , there are issues . Minor ones . Dr. Linus is still adjusting for the side effects . - The side effects ? - Well , reactions . You know , tremors , small seizures , memory loss . But he 's being closely monitored . As they all are . Detective Lange . This is Tony Rigby . That was fast . Picked him up getting on a bus Downtown . Once we put out the APB , it came up on the computers . This is insane . Why the hell am I here ? I 've done nothing . Mr. Rigby , I want to ask you a couple of questions about the murder of Frances Norburg . I 'd heard she 'd been killed- - It 's a tragedy . I don 't know anything else about it . Serious accusations have been made against you and your company Aster Corps . Former company . Former- - You have any questions , ask them . Oh , I plan to- - Trust me . Anyone in particular I should see there ? Yeah , Nicole Farington , the CEO . Farington . One " r " ? Yeah , I 've got nothing else to add . Can I leave now , please ? Actually I have grounds to hold you over for further questioning . I want my lawyer . I bet you do . Let 's put him in interrogation room 1 for now . Yes , sir . Come on , let 's go . Sweetheart , I want you to stay here in the car . Okay . Avram ? Jake ! Avram ! Avram ! Jake ! They 're gone . How do you know that , sweetheart ? I see things . What do you mean you see things- - What things ? I see visions . People . Sometimes I see them before they happen . How often ? I see things when I see them . I don 't when I don 't . Amelia ? I see Jake . Detective Lange , LAPD Homicide . Is there someplace we can speak privately ? And what could we possibly have to speak about ? Amelia Robbins . Detective , we are in the middle of our corporate year end . I can 't express to you how busy we are . Amelia Robbins is a 14-year-old girl who was kidnapped from a boarding care facility called Stanford House in New York city . She was taken to Los Angeles against her will and given a new identity . Exactly what does this have to do with us ? The boarding care facility that she was in is a division of Aster Corps . Uh , actually that boarding care facility 's part of a health care division that 's been sold off to an investment group in Singapore . Clearly not our responsibility . The kidnapped girl was given a false name- - Adeline Danvers . And we found a plane ticket issued to a Miss Danvers on a flight from New York to L.A. , paid for by Aster Corps . Would you kindly look into our human resources database ? Adeline Danvers is junior counsel in our labor and contracts division- - She 's on the 28th floor . I can have her come up to meet you if you 'd like . Excuse me . - What can I do for you ? - Um , yes , we are looking for Randy Kitson . That 's me . Yes , my young friend Jake found this . Uh , we believe it belongs to you . My glasses . You ... were there ... when I crashed my bike . Yes . Thank you , thank you so much . You are most welcome . Can I ... can I do something for you ? Uh , free smoothie ? No thank you . Come along , Jake . Thanks , guys . I don 't understand , Jake Bohm- - What is the significance of this journey ? Not good news , D.L. What am I looking at ? A story falling apart . I 'll call you back . Took a drive out to Newberry Springs , brought my camera . Desert compound ? It 's a distribution warehouse . Yeah , but what about the prison- - - The holding cells and the guards ? - None of the above . Place has a staff of 25 . They ship weatherproof computer cases to China . Site manager says they 've been fully operational going on five years . I don 't get it- - Why would that little girl lie ? No idea , but none of what she said stands up . No razor-wire fence , no guards with guns , no bad guys , no conspiracy- - just computer cases . There 's more . I found this . Partially hidden in the underbrush , like someone discarded it there . Same caliber as the one that killed Lucy Robbins . You ran the prints ? Running as we speak . Amelia , what do you see now ? I see people . A lot of people around Jake . People around Jake . Left , go left . Oh , damn it . I must 've been speeding- - Don 't worry , I 'll just explain to them that we 're looking for Jake . - Officer , I 'm sorry if it looked like I was speeding . - Get on the ground ! - Get on the ground ! - My son is missing . Mr. Bohm , get on the ground ! How do you know my name ? Okay , I 'm getting on the ground . What am I being charged with ? You 're under the arrest for the murder of Lucy Robbins . What ? You need to call Detective Lange , please . Just call Detective Lange ! _ Interesting text . What is it ? It hasn 't been reported yet , but Martin Bohm was arrested for the murder of Lucy Robbins . How do you know that ? Well , I have friends in influential places . You think he actually did it ? Calvin , that 's decidedly beside the point , now , isn 't it ? Good luck . Detective Lange . Please , my son is out there . I need to find him . I didn 't do anything . I swear to you . The evidence is telling me something else . What evidence ? We found the gun . - What gun ? - The one you used to kill Lucy Robbins . You shot her , left her in the car and tossed the weapon . - Your prints were all over it . - You kidding me ? - Anyone could have planted that . - How would they do that ? I don 't know ! The D.A. Considers you a flight risk . He 's going for the maximum bail . Amelia . Wait , wait ... Amelia . Cross-reference Amelia 's DNA with her mother 's so you can prove who she is . You 'll know that Aster Corps faked her death and that I 'm telling the truth . Detective , I need to find my son . I need to find my son now ! We have been here long enough , my friend . We should go home . Doctor . Dr. McCormick . - Do I know you ? - No , you do not . My name is Avram . This is my friend Jake . We believe that your life may be in danger . I don 't-I don 't know what you 're talking about . If-if you 'll just listen , I believe that we were sent here , uh , to find you , to help you . I-I don 't want your help . And I don 't want to be found . We-we met with Shane . The young Marine whose life you saved . You know Shane ? Yes , we met . He explained everything . How you saved his life . How your trouble began . How you stopped sleeping . Doctor , what ... - what are they doing to you ? - Something 's happened to me . My mind has begun working too fast . It made sleep impossible . I went weeks without a single night . I felt like I was dying . But at the sleep center , they 're helping me . Last night I slept . - I actually slept . - Doctor , I believe that you are one of 36 extraordinary individuals . Jake is one of them as well . I can explain . If you come with us , I can protect you . I won 't listen to this . I want you to leave me alone . Doctor , please . What 's happening ? Bohm , you made bail . Hey , Martin . As far as anyone knows , you have a rich aunt somewhere , okay ? You did this ? You paid my bail ? Why ? Judge set the bail at the max : $ 2 million . If I didn 't do this for you , you would have been looking at a year before you even got a trial . They said they had a gun with my prints on it . Any idea how that happened ? I had nothing to do with it . Then who ? Does it really matter ? We both know you didn 't kill Amelia 's mother . How can I trust you ? Look , we both want to take down Aster Corps . These people had my mother killed . Think I 'm going to let them get away with that ? Besides , you don 't have much of a choice , do you ? What now ? I got you out , the rest is up to you . Here 's your car . It 's outside in Lot B. I 'll be in touch . Jake ? Amelia ? Ja ... Oh , sweetheart . I am so sorry . I promise you , we 're going to get everything straightened out . Earlier when you were having your vision , you could see Jake . Can you still see him ? - Yes . - Where is he ? We should get in the car , I 'll show you . Okay , let 's go . - Are we getting any closer ? - Yeah , we 're almost there . Right , go right . Doctor , i-if I can just have another moment of your time ... Please , Dr. McCormick . That was them . Jake . Martin . Jake , get in the car now . Get in the car now . I don 't understand . I told you not to take Jake out of the house . You did it anyway . - It-it 's not what you think . - Two men came into my house last night and tried to kill me and take my son . Don 't you realize how dangerous this is ? Jake 's number led us here . This man may be one of the 36 . I don 't care about the 36 . - I 'm trying to protect my son . - Martin , listen . No , Avram , it 's you who should have listened . Now , are you getting in or not ? Dr. McCormick may be one of the 36 . - I-I must find him . - Suit yourself . Martin . Martin Bohm ! What 's happening ? Please , please . Calvin , I know what you did . I really don 't know what you 're talking about . Amelia Robbins . What about her ? You 've been experimenting on her in a secret location . I was doing it for my brother . William . You know about William ? Of course I do . I know everything that happened . Well , then you understand that ... I 'm responsible for him being there . And , uh , I just , uh ... I have to save him . That 's why I want your focus here . We have seven of them , Calvin . Seven . All as transcendent as the girl . Now , you hold the key to everything . Your mind can lead Aster Corps out of the darkness and into the promised land . So , well , what do you want from me ? The same thing you want from them : The numeric sequence that their brain power can provide . Besides the remapping of your brother 's brain , I 'm assuming you 're aware of its predictive capabilities . Yes . Then you know what it would mean to a corporation like ours to be in possession of such a sequence . Well , with seven of them , you ought to be able to crack it within a matter of days . That 's why I want your passion , your inspiration . I want you to work longer and harder and better than you ever have before . Then your brother can get his life back . All right , peanut butter only . PB and J in quarters . Jake . I know Avram 's your friend . But I 'm your father . And I 'm responsible to make sure that you are safe . And I gave Avram specific instructions not to let you out of the house until I got back . So , when ... You 're right . He 's my friend , too . This is Avram , please leave a message . Avram , it 's Martin . We 're back at your house . Look . I-I was scared , okay ? When I got home and-and you and Jake weren 't here , I ... I thought something had happened . Maybe that you had been taken . Look , I 'm sorry for yelling . Please just ... come back so we can talk . My father has sacrificed everything to keep me safe and to help me find the other special people like me before it 's too late . I may be running out of time . Hello ?

 Hold it , you ! Don 't you have anything to say ? ! I have unfinished business . Min ! Some people never learn ... I gotta go . So do I. I 'll accompany you . Though it 's a bit odd , I won 't be satisfied until I 've crossed blades with you again . Oh brother , what a pain in the neck . You wanna go right now ? Given the current situation , you wouldn 't be able to focus on a battle against me . I can wait until we get this woman of yours back . Well , thanks , for the consideration , bub ! I 'm sorry for the wait ! The bride is almost ready , so ... Logan 's brought Koh with him . Koh ? N-no matter , I 'll have them both eliminated . You should wait here , Father . Logan has come ! He 's made it all the way to the Dragon Palace . Are you happy ? But no matter what you want , you 're going to become my wife . For the sake of both the Kurohagi clan and the Yashida clan ! Master Koh ! Now 's your chance ! I had thought that Kurohagi had ordered you to not let allow anyone through ... Old man ! It has been a long time , Koh . Yashida Shingen ? ! I 'm sorry for the wait ! We will now begin the wedding ceremony for myself , Kurohagi Hideki , and Yashida Mariko ! Where 's Master Shingen ? He suddenly vanished ... Dammit ! Well we can 't worry about it now ! Get the ceremony started ! Yes , sir ! Shingen ! You 've failed to learn your lesson , and have joined with Kurohagi 's son in an attempt to make Madripoor yours again , haven 't you ? I 've never been one to give up on my ambitions . The same could be said of me ... No , you 're just foolishly stubborn . What ? ! It was my greatest mistake allowing you to live when I killed your son , who seduced Miyuki ! Where 'd that geezer go ? ! He better not be dead in some hallway or something ... He won 't go down that easily . Kikyo ! Where 's Mariko being held ? I don 't know . I told you , I wasn 't hired by Kurohagi . Yeah , I get it ! Damn , I guess we 're gonna have to just search every corner of this overgrown rat 's nest ... Yukio ! I won 't make the same mistake twice . If I 'm a stubborn idiot , what does that make you ? ! Aren 't you just a fool , who was deceived by Kurohagi Juo ? ! It 's ironic that you would say that , given how you 're so obsessed with Juo that you continue to live in this shameful fashion . You care more about your rivalry with the dead Juo than vengeance on your son 's killer ! How pathetic ! Shut up ! I 'll give you this much , you at least put up a bit of a fight . W-what are you ? ! I can tell you this much , I 'm nothing like the insect I see before my very eyes who is about to lose his life . Prepare yourself ! Yashida Shingen ! I 'm Yukio , the daughter of Kai and Miyuki , who you murdered ! So their child shows her face ... I 'll kill you , and avenge my parents ! I 'm afraid you 're not up to it . What ? ! Stop ! You 'll be killed ! Move ! I don 't care if it costs me my life , I 'll kill him ! You 'll just die in vain ! Stop worrying about me and go after Kurohagi ! That 's what you 've always wanted , right ? ! Interesting ... Grandfather and daughter , I 'll kill you both at once . We are gathered here today in front of this humble shrine , in a spirit of observation and celebration ... Before the Gods , we will now bear witness to the unification of two fates ... The leader of Madripoor 's wolves , and the son of Kurohagi Juo , Hideki and ... the daughter of Yashida Shingen from Japan , Mariko ... We now seek your blessings in the face of this union ... Hey ! Where 's your boss ? Like I 'd tell you ! It 's useless . These people are like machines that Kurohagi and Shingen control . Even if you were to torture them , they would not reveal anything . Machines , controlled by Kurohagi and Shingen ... What about you ? ... To aid each other , to work together , To follow the teachings of your parents , and to live appropriately ... What 's wrong ? You could 've easily dealt with Kurohagi 's son ! But my appearance wasn 't considered , was it ? It 's appropriate that you die consumed by your petty grudge ! Have at you ! I 'll send you along with him ! That 's far enough ! Logan ? ! Look after the old man ... Yukio ... You 're looking pretty lively , Shingen . I could say the same of you . Thanks . So you 've made it this far ... Don 't tell me you were waiting for me — ? But I want the same thing I did in Japan ... To take Mariko back ! She 's betrothed to the Kurohagi clan now ... and I won 't let a thug like your disrupt our agreement ! If I 'm a thug , I guess that makes you the king cockroach , eh ? Forcing your kid into a marriage she doesn 't want ... That 'd make any decent parent sick ! Babble ... Kikyo . If your failure to eliminate him is any indicator , your sword arm isn 't as impressive as I was led to believe . I can understand the grievances you would have as my employer , Sir Shingen ... However I , Mikage Kikyo , am accustomed to fighting my opponent on equal terms , even if he is my target of assassination . Either way , I 'm voiding our contract , and will kill these insolent dogs myself ! Master Koh ! Miss Yukio ! What are you doing , Mariko ? Mariko , drink it ! What are you doing ? ! If you won 't do it yourself , I 'll make you ! Mariko ! I 've come for you ! Logan ! I regret I won 't be able to kill Kurohagi 's son ... But ... but this may be better ... I wasn 't able to protect Kai and Miyuki , but I was able to protect you ... The fight isn 't over yet ... Be very care ... ful ... Yukio ... Grandfather ... Not another step , Logan ! I 'd ask you to quit playing dirty ... but that 'd be like asking a fish to quit swimming . I don 't wanna hear that from an obsessed , compulsive stalker who chases around after someone else 's fiancé ! It 's real impressive how can you still run your mouth like that when you 're hiding behind someone else . Stay back ! Don 't come any closer ! Logan ... I 'm happy enough that you came this far for me . So no matter what else happens ... Mariko ! Don 't give up . I 'm gonna take you back from that crazed little runt . That 's the only reason I came so far ! Logan ... That 's enough ! You will not have Mariko ! This sham of a wedding is over . Stop ! Don 't shoot ! You might hit me ! Take Mariko . R-Right ! Logan ! Answer me ! Logan ! Come on ! Logan ! Logan ! Mariko ! Don 't worry about me ! I 'll see you soon ! You 're going to die here , Logan . It 's time we settle this ! You 're going to die here , Logan . It 's time we settle this ! Everything else will be gone , but I 'll start anew ! I can 't die until I 've killed him ... This is going to determine the outcome of the battle . I 'd rather die with Logan , the one I love , than live with you ! That 's better . Looks like I can enjoy myself a little longer . Next time on Wolverine ... Logan .

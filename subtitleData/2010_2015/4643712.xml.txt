 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... If the Warehouse is to survive , a new caretaker must be in place before I die . Me . You came into my house and stole from me ... Dismantled my life 's work , and I will respond in kind . The brotherhood follow no rules . I figured it out last week . Whenever I get hurt ... Oh , ow , oh , they got me . Claudia feels the pain . [ Japanese music ] * * in Shinto belief , Emperor Jimmu descended from the sun goddess . He reigned for 75 years , often accompanied by a wild crow . From that crow , there exists a feather . Behold . Beautiful , but deadly . And money ? Also beautiful . Now we drink to honor Jimmu . [ Twanging instrument ] * * [ wind whips ] Stop her ! Oh ! Claude , don 't look , you 'll go insane ! Whew ! [ Low buzzing ] - Wait . - Huh ? Something 's vibrating . I think it 's me . Ugh , it 's my sister , Tracy . Hey , trace , listen , I 'm just at work . I 'll call you back ... What ? Oh , my God , that 's great news . - Congratulations . - What , what , what , what ? ! My sister 's pregnant . I-I 'm gonna be an aunt . I 'm gonna get to hold a new life in my arms . Trace ? Listen , what do you think about a japanese theme for the nursery ? [ Announcer ] Left in the second period ... [ Singing under breath ] Oh , Artemis , hockey , huh ? - Who you rooting for ? - Nobody . Right , let me see if I can explain this whole sports fan thing to you . - Let 's say there was a ... - Hello , kitties ! We 're back from Japan . Domo arigato . Put that thing under a neutralizer light . Whatever you say , Rilakkuma . What 's a Rikaluma ? It 's a japanese bear who loves custard pudding . Oh , Artie , you got a new nickname . How would you like a new job ? Hmm ... I got it for my sister , Tracy . She 's pregnant . - Wow . - Yeah , I 'm so excited . Really ? Yeah . N-no , yeah , no , that 's ... it 's just that you know , she 's , you know , the younger sister , and you 're the older sister . Are you living in 1957 ? Getting pregnant 's not on my current to-do list , all right ? - [ Game goes off ] - How about finding an artifact . Is that on your current to-do list ? We got a ping from last night 's game in Toronto . Let 's go to the videotape . Toronto 's Mike madden has the puck . Baird is charging . Oh ! Baird nails him in the right arm . - So baird has the artifact . - Watch . That looks like a career-ending break . What a shame . This vet 's been on fire lately , but you break your arm , and it 's over . There , do you see that ? - I do . - See what ? What , she 's the observant one , and I 'm the one who eats all the time . Hey , w-wait , he 's up . Madden is up ! So madden has some kind of healing artifact . Oh , he 's healed , all right , and he 's stronger than ever . Fast forwarding . Baird with the puck . Madden approaches him ... Wow ! - Whoa . - That 's not hockey . That 's pole vaulting . How the hell did he do that ? That 's what I want you to find out . Stop that hockey player before he kills someone . We 're on it . And I 'm gonna stay here and keep you company . At least he does what he 's told . Oh ... he 's so soft and fuzzy . The bear too . Oh ! [ Sighs ] Oh , um , this arrived for you . What ? Who would write me at the Warehouse ? I encourage you to open the envelope and find out . I 've been cordially invited to lunch . Eek . By Mrs. Frederic . Why ? Why ? Why don 't you ask her ? Over lunch . Do you think this has something to do with the weird feelings I 've been having lately ? What weird feelings ? I don 't know , like , uh ... Out of nowhere I get these weird kicks in the gut , my heart races , I can 't catch my breath . It 's like I 'm not in control of myself . [ Screams ] Why didn 't you tell me about this sooner ? I don 't know , I didn 't wanna worry you ? Look , forget I said anything . I clearly have bigger problems . [ Crowd noise , buzzer ] [ Background chatter ] Hey , are you guys going in to watch practice ? - Could you take this in for me ? - And this ? - You know , for Mike madden ? - Are those molasses crinkles ? Okay , keep moving . Okay , remember , for Mike . [ Mouth full ] Oh , I love molasses crinkles . One thing I 've learned in 20 years of running a team ... Never eat fan food . It could be laced with who knows what . - Could make your parts fall off . - [ Spits out cookie ] - Coach ! - [ Whistles ] All right , listen up . The league sent these nice folks out . They have some questions . You will answer them . I 'd like to start with Mike madden . Of course you would . Anything to meet the most eligible bachelor in Toronto . - [ All laugh ] - Pffft ! [ Background chatter ] Hi , I 'm agent Bering . Well , it 's nice to meet you agent Bering . So , I just wanted to ask you ... Why I was voted the most eligible bachelor in Toronto ? I 'm sure I 'll read all about that in your memoir . Um , you 've been playing rough lately . Right , and the league has a problem with that ? It 's hockey . Well , you put a guy through the glass . - How 'd you do that ? - Well , there must have been a crack in it already . But you 'd just been injured very badly . Yes , but during a game , your adrenaline surges , so you just keep going . Well how about now , are you in pain now ? Look , every player on the ice is in pain . We live with it 24 / 7 , but if you think I 'm on something , feel free to draw some blood , or I could pee in a cup for you . You got a cup ? May I see that necklace you 're wearing ? The league is cracking down on gold . So I would like to test it . Unless , of course , you have a problem removing it . [ Chuckles ] - Uh ... you finished ? - Yeah . Gooery didn 't need to be flushed after all . Where you headed ? Uh , inventory . Hang back , tray , I 'm gonna need you . Artie 's lying . Hey , the team is winning 'cause we 're all working our butts off . Oh , yeah ? Well , maybe some people have a little help , you know ? Insurance . We 're all clean here . Right , boss ? That 's right , beast . None of my boys take any performance-enhancing substances . Now here 's the x-ray you asked for . Mike 's arm , taken right after the game . No reaction . Good . Well , here you go . And it 's shinier than before . And stickier too . - Are we done ? - One more question . - Do you like antiquing ? - What ? You know , going to flea markets , buying old stuff ? Are you asking me on a date ? Just answer the question like the team owner said . No , because it 's a stupid question . - Good-bye . - There are no stupid questions , okay ? Only stupid people . So if anyone 's stupid here , it 's you ! He 's hostile and unresponsive . I wonder why . Oh , here I got the x-ray of madden 's stupid arm ! So wh ... what , you can read those things ? Yeah , I was pre-med before I was pre-law before I joined the secret service . And yet , you ended up in the exact same place as me . I 'm just saying . Something 's wrong . The hand in this x-ray shows a bilateral fusion between the trapezium and the trapezoid . It 's a congenital condition . So ? And may I add , huh ? So when I shook Mike 's hand ... I felt those bones , and there was no fusion . The x-Ray 's a fake ? This isn 't stupid madden 's stupid arm . We need to break into the medical office and find the real x-ray . All right , we need a distraction . I 'm gonna jump on the Zamboni , and I 'm gonna zoom around the ice while you ... Pete , no one 's ... no one 's looking at us ... so ... I know , but I wanted to ride the Zamboni . I know you did . It 's okay . Let 's go . No . No . [ Dog barks ] Trailer . [ Dog whines ] He 's with me . You shouldn 't have followed me . Artie , you 're lying . You know I can tell . Now , what 's going on ? Artifacts are disappearing from the Warehouse . First it was Bobby Fischer 's marble and now ... Primo Levy 's scarf and who knows what else has been taken . I thought the Warehouse had a detection system that alerts you when artifacts go missing . It should ... it does , but it didn 't alert my computer . Okay , so let 's just call Claudia and ... Nope , no . No , we 'll ... just keep all this between us for now . - Understood ? - Okay . Well , this can 't have been random . I went myself to turin in 1987 to snag the scarf . - So it meant something to you . - Yeah . What other items would get under your skin . The katana . The katana . Aisle kamakura east ! Come on ! Come on , tray . [ Woof ] Did you find madden 's real arm ? Yeah . There 's no fusing in the metacarpals . And , I mean , the bone is clearly broken , but this ... this I have never seen before . The muscle and cartilage have actually grown around the broken bone to support it . That thing 's being held together by the artifact equivalent of spit and glue . Yeah , but it 's not just his arm . I mean , his knee is shot and his ribs are cracked . This guy should not be playing professional hockey . Pete , this guy shouldn 't even be walking . - [ Water running ] - [ Laughing ] Aw , man . Quick , before he gets out of the shower . Okay . Helmet . The mouth guard . Shin guard . - Uh ... - Penis guard . Eew . No reaction . Maybe Mike has the artifact on him . No , he 's naked in the shower , and I already checked his chain . How much you pay me not to tell anyone you said that ? - 50 bucks . - Done . Okay . Really , that 's how it 's gonna be , eh ? Well , what do you want ? You 're holding out on me ! I 'll go . I 'll stay here . No , I 'm not , I swear to God , I 'm not . Then what 's making you so strong , huh ? ! Back off , Frank , or I 'll do to you what I did to baird . Hey , knock it off ! Stay out of this , man . No , I 'm in it , okay ? And so is the league if you don 't back off right now . Fine , man . We 're cool , right , Mike ? Yeah , yeah , we 're cool . Aw , man , these were brand new . [ Whispers ] Myka , Myka . Hey , sign says team personnel only . Oh , well I must have missed it . Well someone 's not very observant . Well someone 's penis guard is not very b ... Ho-kay . Uh , why don 't we let Mike get dressed , and , uh , I need to talk to you . Okay ? Here we go . - Come on . - Oh , look , there it is . I see your stupid sign now . Mykes , Mykes , he was fighting in there . And he wasn 't the same guy we saw on the ice . He was in pain . I don 't think he 's using an artifact . I think someone 's using one on him . What about Larry Kemp , the owner ? That would explain why he gave us the wrong x-ray . Well ... okay . Let 's just hope he 's not in the shower too . Thank you , ma 'am . Be right back . Miss Donovan , thank you for joining me . Sure . Am I late ? Did I miss lunch ? No time . Let 's take a walk . That 's what the mafia says when you 're about to get whacked . Do they ? Well , this concerns your relationship with the Warehouse . Oh , my , uh , my destiny ? And mine . Has something changed ? Not yet . I just think it 's time you had a glimpse . Don 't worry , you won 't be whacked . - Come . - Yes , ma 'am . All right , Kemp , spit it out . What did you do to Mike madden ? Well , hello to you , too . Canadian customs confiscate your manners ? - [ Annoyed laugh ] - How 's he sustaining that level of play ? Like all great athletes , he 's rising to the challenge . He 's practically crippled , which is why you showed us the phony x-ray . It 's not like you had a warrant . Mike put a guy through the glass . Now what are you doing to him ? What am I doing to him ? Look , two of my best players are on the injured reserve list . If I were doing anything to help him play , I would do it to them and not an old war horse like Mike madden . Aw , come on , I mean , the guy 's having a great year . Oh , yeah , he really brings it for the fans at the home games , and on the road , he 's a total wash . I think we 're done here . - Pete ? - Yeah ? I think we need to take a closer look at the rink . So Mike brings it at home games . Ipso facto , the artifact must be here in the arena . Another facto , I was watching Mike during practice . The guy was wobbly . So what 's here during games that isn 't here the rest of the time ? I don 't know , fans ? Mykes , maybe one of the hometown fans is " bringing it " for Mike . And that narrows it down to about 15,000 suspects . Gone ! Gone ! And gone ! Gone ! Someone is undoing my life 's work ! Can you please stop for a second ? Look , we just need to think and get ahead of this thing . Now is there any artifact the intruder might have taken that 's easy for us to locate ? An artifact with a homing device ? Yeah , that would be convenient . The McCoy rifle . I snagged the McCoy rifle . Don 't just stand there ! You do know I 'm on foot , right ? Excellent ! The McCoy rifle is gone . And ... now we gotta see if the hatfield rifle is missing too . We have to separate both rifles . Wouldn 't he take both ? Not if he 's trying to make a point . I did not snag the hatfield rifle . That was another agent . If the hatfield rifle is here , it will lead us to the McCoy . - Come on ! - If you 're trying to kill me , you 're too late . Look around , miss Donovan . - Do you sense anything ? - Hunger ? I think there 's a falafel place down the ... Pay attention . Look beyond what you see . Her . Very good . Don 't point . It 's rude . What is it about her ? Stay focused . [ Door opens , bell dings ] [ Baby coos ] Be a good boy . Did you set those earrings aside for me ? This is a robbery ! We 're not here to intervene . Stay with me . Don 't move ! Don 't ! Everybody just get down on the ground ! [ Screams ] No ! No ! [ No sound ] Help is coming . You 're gonna be okay . You saved that baby 's life . I 'm a doctor ... if you 're not needed , please step back . Did you know that was gonna happen ? It depends what you mean by " that " and what you mean by " happen " . Well , I saw her bracelet get all glowy , but I don 't know what the artifact did unless ... Unless that was ... The birth of an artifact . Imbued by the bravery of a moment , an ordinary woman doing an extraordinary thing . Shouldn 't we snag it ? No , it 's hers . It only becomes ours if it starts causing trouble . But d ... I thought most artifacts came from ... Bold-face names , you know ? People with Wikipedia pages . The creation of an artifact is simply the meeting of an object , a person and a moment . That 's a good glimpse . You got a rockin ' gig , Mrs. F. Mrs. Frederic . There 's something else you should see . Oh , uh , am I going with you or ... Unless you 'd like to take the bus . Okay . Look , Mike , we can 't get into specifics , but we 're pretty sure one of your fans is boosting your ability to play . Are there any particular fans that you interact with ? No , I 'm polite , but you gotta keep your distance . We really appreciate this . We know that , um , this might end your season , so ... Well , hey , if I 'm getting some kind of outside help , I don 't want it ; That 's cheating and , um , I don 't cheat . All right , well , here 's the plan . We 're gonna gather all your hardcore fans into one section , then we 're gonna raffle off a dinner with you after the game . Yes , and early in the game , you 'll take a fall and pretend to be hurt very badly . Like during the last game . Exactly , and then we 'll , you know , we 'll study them very closely to make sure none of them pulls out a rolling pin or something . A what ? Nothing . Just ignore him . Hey , uh , okay , we gotta finish setting up . No problem , I got it . Agent Bering ? I still don 't know your first name . Oh , it 's , uh , Myka . Wow , Mike and Myka . Like papageno and papagena from ... Mozart 's magic flute . [ Laughs ] You know opera ? Yeah , yeah , don 't tell my teammates . Well , ' cause you never know ... Hey , can we get going ? Uh , you can play Mike 's magic flute later . I have to go kill him now , so I 'm just gonna ... go ... Ugh , get me some popcorn and a tampon , 'cause I am watching a romantic comedy . What ? ! Shut up ! Oh , yeah , you and Mike meet , you hate each other and the next thing you know , you 're kissing . That 's crazy . Oh , yeah ? 'Cause love is crazy , Mykes . [ Snaps fingers ] That 's right , girl . I am the sassy best friend . We caught a break . Hatfield rifle is still here . Gloves . And how 's it connected to the other rifle ? Gravitational pull between the barrels fueled by the hatred between the clans and also ... now your eyes are younger than mine . You look through the sights , tell me what you see . Just ... Okay . It 's just a window and what looks like a garage . Any identifying landmarks ? Just a giant cow . Cow . Like a cow with lipstick ? Yeah . I know that cow . It 's outside a steakhouse in featherhead . Excellent clue . Not a bad lunch . Bring the rifle . [ Crowd cheers ] Marry me ! Okay , guys . Make sure you put your name , correct information , and your seat number ... Good job ... For the big raffle 's after the game . Whoo-hoo ! Oh , well , that 's cute . Just , I 'm sorry , one card each . She 's always over the top . Oh , yeah . - Hey . - Hey . Are you all set to do this ? Who knows ? - Sure . - I wish I could tell you more about what 's going on , it 's just , uh ... - Unexplainable . - Yeah . Sorry . Thank you . You know , when I first met you , I didn 't wanna let go then either . That was kinda unexplainable too . For good luck ? Look , Mike 's kissing someone ! You go , girl ! [ Horn blows ] Hey . Hey , there , buckaroo . Uh ... [ Stammering ] I-I 'm the purse inspector . [ Chuckles nervously ] I know . Where ... Where 's your mom and dad ? Jakey , what are you doing ? Come on . Our seats are over here . [ Crowd gasps ] Mike 's hurt ! [ Crowd booing ] [ Whistle blows ] [ Groans ] Oh , my God , what the hell is that ? ! [ Screams ] [ Cell phone rings ] Myka , where 'd you go ? Pete , I 'm in the ladies room behind section d . I need you now . - Mykes ? - Yeah ... Oh , my God , you 're ... you 're pregnant . I know ... You 're really , really pregnant . I know . How the hell did that happen ? I don 't know ! I 'm guessing she had sex . Pete ? You know my ... oh , Pete , my bra 's really not made for these . Okay , okay , here , put this on . Yes . Oh , my God , I had to get out of there . The smell of ammonia ... I - I can smell everything now . All right , well , in advance of what I 'm sure I 'll do , - I apologize . - Who ? Right , okay , look , Mykes , somebody whammied you . Ya think ? Okay , I know where and when , but I don 't know who , what , or how . Both : Call Artie . If Claudia finds out you borrowed her Prius C , she 's gonna rake you over the coals . Well , joke 'll be on her then . What ? Uh , nothing . Hey , have you , uh , checked out this car 's entune system ? It 's got , uh , bing and pandora . Oh , what a relief . That way if we can 't find the missing artifact , we can customize our music stations . - Hey , caw . - Yes . I think the garage must be nearby . - Whoa ! - Yeah , yeah , yeah . The hatfield rifle 's starting to tug . That means the McCoy is nearby . [ Farnsworth buzzes ] Wait ... - Artie ! - This better be important . Artie , I 'm pregnant . Ha , ha and I 'm Mary , queen of scots . What ? How did you ... Pete ! [ Stutters ] I didn 't even touch her . Look , Artie , I was at the hockey and game , and I felt this pain in my abdomen , and then I don 't know what happened and I don 't know why I 'm starting to cry . It 's hormonal . Don 't say hormonal , okay ? It makes me wanna cry more . See , that 's why I never married . Preaching to the choir . Look , Artie , this came out of nowhere . We thought we were hunting for a healing artifact owned by a fan . A healed athlete , pregnant woman . This could be a wish-fulfillment artifact instead . Myka , what did you touch ? What ? ! You ... you ... you think that I wished for this ? What is wrong with you guys ? Okay , I am very happy for my sister , but I don 't wanna be pregnant . Yeah , well , who else would wish this on you ? Well , I don ... I don 't know , Artie . Uh , Mike ? I mean , we did kiss . Artie , the rifle ... I can 't hold still much longer . Well , talk to Mike , and no more kissing ! - He didn 't even say good-bye . - He never does . Okay . You know , Pete , maybe ... Maybe I don 't know myself . You know , maybe ... maybe I am jealous of my sister . Maybe I did wish for this . Yeah , I don 't think so . What makes you say that ? Because I wished for it . What ? Well , I don 't know , Mykes . You know , it was just a passing thought . I mean , I saw this cute kid , and I called him buckaroo . What would that have to do with me being pregnant ? Well , I 've been thinking , you know , am I ever gonna have a family ? You know , I mean , who wants to share my insane life ? And then , I realized that someone already shares my insane life . Just stop , okay ? Stop ! I will not start crying again . Okay , okay , what ... What were you in contact with when you saw that little boy ? The keychain , Mykes . The keychain , it had a bunch of things on it . Okay , okay , then we 'll find the keychain . We 'll neutralize it . But first , I have to pee . [ Grunts ] [ Metal clangs ] [ Gunfire ] Close the door ! Hey , are you okay ? [ Panting ] What the hell ? I could have been shot ! Yeah ... I ... sorry , I kinda forgot you had the rifle . Oh , you forgot ? Yeah , what are you getting so upset about ? You would have been shot , but you 're on the metronome . - You wouldn 't have died . - Yeah , but Claudia might have . Excuse me ? Uh ... what ? No , no . I don 't know . Steve ? You were saying something about Claudia . Please , go on . All right . Ever since Claudia brought me back , we 've been ... Connected . Every time I get hurt , she feels the pain . Oh , so that 's the weirdness she was talking about . See , I was afraid that ... Something else . - Uh , she doesn 't know . - No . That 's why I 've been trying to lay low . - It 's to protect her . - Yeah . We gotta get you off that metronome . I 've been looking into it , Artie . I don 't know if it 's possible . At Warehouse 13 , anything 's possible . You know , sometimes . Yeah , we gotta get this rifle back in the trunk before you get Claudia shot . Guys , where is she ? The one who was sitting here ? She left . She was super-pissed at Mike for kissing that pretty girl . - She wasn 't that pretty . - Hey , she 's pretty ! Wait , you have all the fans names , right ? Yeah , yeah . Uh , uh ... There , Judy Giltoy , I even have her address . - Okay , just give me a push . - Okay . They 're all here . The katana sword , McCoy rifle ... The Van Gogh . Mata Hari 's stockings . Huh . Primo Levy 's scarf . Artie Nielson , this is your life . You okay ? No , I 'm not okay . This is a massive breach . Which we stopped . And as soon as everyone gets back , we 'll all track d ... No , it 's too dangerous to ... There is a protocol . I will inform everyone at the right time . Let 's just get everything back to the Warehouse . Artie ? Those are shipping supplies . I 'm not sure this is everything . Hello ? Anybody home ? Yup , we 're definitely in the right place . Sorry about stopping . I just so really needed Mexican food . That other burrito was supposed to be for me . I know . Whoa , hey , check this out . Turns out Mike did know Judy , which explains why she got so mad about the kiss . Pete , it 's the same shot of Judy in both of these pictures . She photoshopped herself in . - [ Exhales ] - Yeah . All right . " John Giltoy , beloved father and grandfather . " He died recently . Oh , he was a world war ii vet . Oh , no way . He survived the bataan death march . He and his buddy , Roy Shrop . Mykes , listen to this . " With 20 Miles remaining , Shrop fell deathly ill . " The japanese would have left him for dead , " but Giltoy urged him on . " ' You can do this ' , Giltoy told his friend , over and over . " Compelled his friend to perform an extraordinary feat . He wished so hard , he made it true . Mykes , there were dog tags on Judy 's keys . I mean , they were probably the grandpa 's right ? So we just wait here for her to come home and snag the artifact . That 's great . But I have to pee again . - Okay . - Okay . Hey , Mike , Mike , hi . Would you get in my car , please ? Excuse me , do I know you ? Mike , I need you to get in my car . Pete , she 's not coming home . There 's no toothbrush or toothpaste . The drawers are all open . She packed in a hurry . - She 's gone . - Yeah , but where ? Look , I really appreciate your ... See , you shouldn 't make me do this . Then I wish your arm wasn 't healed . - [ Bones crack ] - [ Screams ] Let 's get in my car before I have to do your knees too . You know , start again . Hi . I 'm Judy , and I love you , Mike . And you love me . You just don 't know it yet . They found his keys and his gym bag on the ground . Security camera showed a woman shoving him into her car , but police couldn 't read the plates . All right , uh , thanks . We 'll ... we 'll call you if we hear anything . Judy has abducted Mike , and the police have no idea where they are . All right , okay . Uh ... clue . Got to focus , focus . Mykes , can you do your ... Your observing thing ? You know , it 's kind of hard right now . Right . Um , what about , um , what about your female intuition ? Right ? I mean , you 've never been more , you know , female-y , right ? So if you were an emotionally unstable female ... Not saying that you are , not saying that you are ... But if you were , where would you take him ? There . Grandpa left Judy the dog tags , his ashes , and I bet that he left her that cabin too . We 'll get the address from Artie on the way . Hi . I made us some hot cider . Hmm ? Oh , isn 't this romantic ? Hi . How you feeling ? Better . After you fixed my arm . Again . Ha ha . You 're welcome . Oh , Mike , oh , Mike , Mike , Mike , Mike . I have done so much for you . Now , my plan was to wait until after the championships to tell you , but then I saw you kissing that woman . See , I 've been cheering you all season long , Mike . Wishing you to shoot faster and skate harder and throw that guy through the glass . Oh , and you didn 't even know we were a team . - I did not . - I know . So , uh , what do you want from me ? Um , well ... We could start with a kiss . Okay ... Yeah . Close your eyes . [ Interested ] Mm . [ Gasps ] - [ Bones crack ] - [ Screams ] You are gonna wish you didn 't do that . [ Snores ] Whatever you 're doing , stop , please . My legs . Oh , now see , that 's the pain that you would have felt every day if I hadn 't wished it away . Wish it away again . Please . Um , no , I 'm sorry . Not until you learn to behave . [ Groans ] [ Footsteps crunching ] Shh ! Quiet . Damn it , what 's he doing here ? - [ Groans ] - Shh ! [ Groans ] Ow ! Ow ! Hey , are you all right ? Not really . She went out back , she 's got an axe . Well , never a dull moment . Dude , your leg 's not supposed to bend like that . I know ! [ Groans ] Judy ? - Pete ! - Mykes ? ! I don 't know how you people found me , but I am not in the mood for this ! Oh , my God , how much perfume are you wearing ? I 'm gonna ... I 'm gonna puke . - Hey ! - Shoot her , Pete ! I don 't have a shot , Mykes . Drop your gun , or I hurt your fat friend . - Hey ! - All right , just ... Hey , g-go easy , okay ? Obviously my friend is pregnant and harmless . She tried to shoot me with that weird gun . I dropped the tesla , and I couldn 't pick it up . Okay ? We 're both unarmed . We 'll get in the car and forget this ever happened . No , you won 't . You 're gonna go get the police . Which is why I now have to take care of this . You really shouldn 't have come . I wish your lungs would collapse . [ Gasps for breath ] No ! I wish you were taking your last breath . - [ Gasps ] - Pete ! Pete ! Pete ! No ! [ Laughs ] Nice try , misery ! Surprise ! Back at ya ! [ Electricity crackles ] [ Screams ] I hooked it with my toe . Ha ha . That 's right . Don 't mess with the mama bear . Oh , my God , Pete . Pete , I think I just peed myself a little . Just ... Pete , hurry , bag the artifact , quick ! Yeah , yes , yes . - Pete , quick ! - Hold on ! Oh , my God . Oh , my God . I-I got my body back ! I have a stomach and a waist and hips . It 's all good ! It 's goodie good good good ! [ Both laugh ] [ Screams ] Oh , my God , I should go check on Mike . Eh ? You go , girl . [ Snaps fingers ] Hey . - Hey . - Hey . So , uh , how 's Mike ? He 's okay . Hockey players can , uh , - really handle pain . - Mm . And you ? Well , only my romantic comedy would turn into a Steven king movie , so ... Pretty good twist at the end , though . Yeah , how did you know to fake your own death ? I don 't know . I just ... after Judy made her wish , right ? I realized that I could still breathe . Of course , you know , she had an axe to your throat , so I just kinda ... went with it . So why didn 't the wishing work ? I 've been thinking about that too . Maybe the dogtags just work on people that you love , right ? Um , like , Judy 's grandpa used it on his army buddy , Judy used it on Mike , I used it on y ... Do I ... do I have a booger ? Oh , no . No , no , no , no , no , no . Look closely . You just admitted that you love me . Oh , Myke , I also love fajitas and cage fighting and bald women ... I mean , Sinead o 'Connor ? That 's a nice try , Lattimer , okay ? But face it , I wield tremendous power . - Yes , you wield the power . - I do . Look , for the record , when it happens for real , I think that you 'll make a pretty great mom . Really ? Yeah . I mean , look at the way you protected me today . And ... I mean , you 're really good at nagging . - We should get going . - See ? I 'm just ... I 'm gonna go say good-bye to Mike . I 'm not gonna go say good-bye to Mike because , I mean , how many different ways can this movie end ? You know , I 'm all out of you go , girls . Gonna be talk to the hand from now on . Is this another artifact being created ? Because I don 't sense anything . Oh . Is that Mr. Frederic ? Yes . He 's my grandson . But he 's ... So you 're son is ... Long gone . Not all wonder is endless , Claudia . [ Soft song ] * *

 In my flash-forward , I saw that I was pregnant . I have to conceive this baby next week to match what I saw . There 's a guy we 've been investigating . We 've been calling him " D. Gibbons . " Charlie said , " D. Gibbons is a bad man . " You haven 't asked her about him ? I 've tried . She 's ... shut down . Everything bad we saw was here in L.A. What if we just ran- - upped and moved away ? Ganwar Region , 1991 . There were anecdotal reports of a mass loss of consciousness . Photos show five towers . I designed them . You can 't make sense of the tower without me , and you know it . Season 1 - Episode 14 - = = Better Angels = = - Okay , try this one ... It means , " I don 't eat dairy . " O-Okay . Try this one ... Good. it means , " What did you see ? " So ... I was baking bread . Bread ! Yes ! And--And you ? I was water-skiing . Good for you . Hey , I thought this weekend you were supposed to " bake bread . " Vogel 's little field trip kind of closed the window on that . Got that one ? - I want a gun . - It 's not happening . Going into Somalia without a gun is like going scuba diving without an oxygen tank . You 're here in an advisory role . They 're here to back us up . I suggest you stick close to ' em . Let 's get to the tower and get out of here . Come in . What is that ? The Hydra- - seven heads , bad breath , killed by Hercules . Why am I looking at it ? D. Gibbons- - Dyson Frost- - Simcoe gave us his name . Here 's the rest of the story . Brilliant , reclusive particle physicist Trained in engineering at M.I.T. , Minored in Victorian Lit . An achiever . Typical story- - domineering father , Only spoke to him in French even though they grew up in Wyoming . Became a chess Grand Master at 15 . The chess piece you found in Pigeon . The white queen . Apparently , he still plays , which is weird Considering he was killed in a boating accident in 1990 On a boat called " Les Monstre de Boisteau " - - Boisteau 's monster . Who 's Boisteau ? Pierre Boisteau- - 18th century French writer . He had illustrations of monsters in some of his books . Among the more well-known- - the Hydra . The Hydra . On my board on the 29th . It 's all leading back to Frost . Somehow , he 's even part of Charlie 's vision . Charlie saw him ? D. Gibbons is a bad man . " D. Gibbons is a bad man . " That 's all I 've been able to get out of her . Meanwhile , everything we know about him is coming to a head , and all we 've got are blind alleys and cryptic messages . What the hell am I supposed to do with that ? - Be like Hercules and slay the beast . Keep looking for Dyson Frost . There it is . " Abandon hope , all ye who enter here . " Keep movin ' . It 's not so bad here . A bit sleepy . A little hotter than I expected . Awaale , We need you to translate . Tell them we 're aid workers with Red Panda Resources , A relief organization , Protected under articles 59 through 63 of the Geneva Convention . We have a right to humanitarian access . My name is Abdikalif . I speak English . You don 't need him anymore . Major Edited by Jazli and Ralfko I know you . I saw you on Al Jazeera Telling the world you caused the blackout . Always nice to meet a fan . You did not cause this . God caused this . He merely put your finger on the button . We are employees ... of Red Panda . We 're on a relief mission to deliver cholera kits . This man is not a relief worker . We were having mechanical problems . Okay , now if you just let us continue on to our destination- - Do not lie to me ! This was your destination . You arrived at your destination . You came here for a reason ... Just like the others . What others ? When I was a boy ... The foreigner came to our village and told us they would bring us electricity . They said five towers would provide power until the end of time , that it was a humanitarian act . But those towers were not for electricity . They were for something else , Something not humanitarian . I had gone out to tend the goats . I was not away long , only a few moments . But even a single moment can change ... Everything . What happened- - It made no sense . I felt afraid . They were there , but ... They were gone . Hooyo ! Hooyo ! Hooyo ! But it was all part of God 's plan- - This I learned from my mother- - Everything in this life happens for a purpose . And before the hand of death could take hold of me , too ... I ran . Let me go ! come on. i 'm just the pilot ! That man , for instance , is here for a purpose . And now he has served it . You are here for a reason , and I will kill you- - All of you--if you do not tell me what that reason is . Oh , damn . I 'm- - I 'm so sorry . It 's not a big deal . Are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine. um ... A little light reading ? I like the pictures . Seriously ? Orgo ? Okay , um , just shut up for a second . I 'm--I 'm kind of ... I 'm thinking about possibly- - Thinking about possibly what ? I 'm trying out a pre-med class . All right ? So that 's the big secret ? Well , I don 't want people to know about it . Because it 's really hard , and I don 't want them to see me fall on my face . " Dr. Kirby . " It 's got a nice ring to it . - Mm-hmm . That 's very funny . Thank you . No , seriously , that 's- - that 's the most difficult thing about becoming a doctor , is picking the right name . I mean , take me , for instance . My real name is Martin Goathead . You 're an idiot . Really . Martin Goathead . Yeah , I think I like " Bryce Varley " better . Of course you do . It sounds rugged . It 's , like , a guy that eats protein bars and climbs mountains- - " Dr. Bryce Varley . " Promise me you won 't tell anybody , please . Nicole , I wouldn 't do that to you . Are you sure you 're all right ? Oh , look at you . Diagnosing patients already ? I 'm fine . Look , uh , I gotta run , Dr. Kirby . Dr. Goathead . Why don 't we just tell ' em who we are and why we 're here we 're not breaking cover . Hey , he 's not buying the Red Panda bit , and I 'm not gonna sit around waiting for a bullet in my head . Right . ' cause you 're waiting for three to the chest . What 'd you say ? You heard me . It doesn 't matter if it happens here or your couch or in the arms of your soon-to-be widow . Let 's face it . You 're done . Thought we said not the face . My ball to call . Let 's get to the chopper , get the guns , neutralize Abdi 's men , then we interrogate ' em . Let 's move . If all goes well ... you might get that gun . All right , now once we start firing , Abdi 's other men are gonna be coming . Take the shot ... Fire . Let 's move ! Go , go , go ! Come on . Simon . Come on . Here they come ! What the hell is that ? Fire ! They failed me . But you will not . You will fulfill your part of the plan . Honey ? Hey ! Lunch is ready ! Hey . Hey . 3-bedroom colonial with a sunporch ? - That 's right . In Denver . It 's where we could go- - Denver . Big fan of the omelet . It 's one hell of an omelet . But seriously , I mean , I 've been doing some research . There 's two major hospitals in Denver , And they both need surgeons , and the FBI has a division in Denver . I mean , we--we can do this . - So this is why we 're having lunch . Well , that , and I wanted to see your beautiful face . The mile-high city . I could join the ski police , be home at 5 : 00 ... me by the fire you wrapped up in a vegan tiger skin ... nothing on underneath . Doesn 't sound so bad . Look , I mean , I- - you know , We don 't have to make any decisions right now , but I think we should soon . Hey , there 's , um , something I wanted to talk to you about , too- - Something we haven 't been talking about . Charlie , what she saw- - we need to know . - Livy , we 've needed to know for a while now . - I thought we said we were gonna give her time . We 're doing that for us . But if she knows something , something that can help this investigation , then that goes way beyond us . - Well , what is it you think that she knows ? There are things in this investigation that keep coming back . - D. Gibbons . He 's at the center of everything . I kept thinking I could do this without involving our family , but we can 't ignore this . We can 't deny this anymore . Listen , I-I have people at the FBI office who know how to talk to kids . I want to take Charlie down there tomorrow and just see if maybe- - - Can you let me talk to her first ? You can take her , but can I try talking to her first ? Okay . This isn 't beyond us , Mark . I know . And I mean it . Will you take a look at this stuff ? You know , it is one hell of an omelet . On this continent , a child dies every six seconds from malnutrition . Your country could easily provide this food , yet it does not . - That 's not true . Every year , we send hundreds of millions of dollars in aid just to have it stolen by people like you . People who live in heaven shouldn 't judge those who live in hell . Tell me who you people are , or I will kill him . Sod off . Who are you ? Tell me . They are CIA , here to investigate the tower . We are security . This is your security ? So you are with CIA . You are not afraid of death . I 've gotten used to it . What do you want with that tower ? Why have you brought the scientist here ? We think what happened on October 6th , the day of the blackout , happened before on a smaller scale in your village because of the towers . - No . I came back from herding the goats . I saw them on the ground . They were dead . It was no blackout . How do you know they were dead ? - I saw the black camel . What 's the black camel ? - Black camel 's considered a bad omen here . Death is a black camel that kneels at every man 's gate . They ... were ... dead . I returned from the refugee camps changed , a man now . The bodies of my people were gone , and all that remained was a village of ghosts . And there was only one tower left . Word spread that I had lived when others had died , and for this , I became feared . I used this fear and became what I am now . God 's plan . And then the day of the blackout , I had my prophecy . I saw it . I was making a speech . I spoke of the " Better Angels . " ... when again touched by the Better Angels of our nation . I called myself " the new face of Somalia . " I was telling the world . I spoke as a conqueror , my enemies crushed- - God 's plan . I 'm not willing to wait one day longer ! There will be one more war in this land--my war . I will rule this country . The Better Angels ... the better warriors ... will win . And you will help , because you are CIA . You can get me these things- - planes , tanks , boats- - What I will need to win my war . That 's not gonna happen . Planes , tanks , boats ! You will get me these things ! No , no , no , no ! It happens every six seconds . Vogel , just make the call . The request alone will tell our people what 's going on . I 'm not going to make the call because no one 's going to pick up the call . It 's like I told you before- - there is no cavalry . We 're on our own . - There 's gotta be some options here . Meeting his demands isn 't one of them . - That 's it ? We just die ? Janis , come on . You saw yourself alive on April 29th . And that lunatic actually saw himself the leader of this country . - Right . " Better Angels . " Better Angels . Which will it be ? Quaad . Wait . Get off him ! Which will it be ? Which will it be ? Your prophecy is wrong ! What you saw- - it isn 't what you saw , and I can prove it to you . I know about the Better Angels . Sit down . You say you know about the Better Angels . Tell me what you know . It 's from Abraham Lincoln 's inaugural address . Lincoln was- - - Your president . Ended slavery . He was strong , not afraid to crush his enemies . We were fighting a civil war in our country , just like your country . " Better Angels " was a speech about unity , about bringing people together . - You do not know what I saw . No , I don 't , but I think I might be able to find someone who did . Can you get on the internet here ? We created a web site where people can come on and share their prophecies with each other . Here . A man was at the assembly of the African Union at a peace conference . You were speaking . How do you know what this man says is true ? You tell me . Look , they know your name . They say you were wearing a wire necklace with an amber bead surrounded by two red ones . Do you have something like that ? No ... but my mother did . Hooyo ! Hooyo ! I haven 't seen that necklace or my mother since I was a boy . Someone else says they saw you- - said that you were quoting Lincoln- - " To every living heart and hearthstone " " All over this broad land ... " " Will yet swell the chorus of the union " " When again touched ... " " When again touched ... " " By the Better Angels of our nature . " You don 't need tanks or guns . Your destiny is to stop the war , not start one . Yes ! Spare ! Yeah ! I 'm throwing rocks tonight . Mark it , mommy . Nice job . You want to play ? I think I 'll play after . I want to talk first . Okay . Ah , Charliebear ... So , uh , do you remember when Tim Tim talked to Squirrlio about heroes ? When Finnegan the Supershark trapped them in the snow globe of snow doom ? Yeah , Squirrlio-zactly ! Yeah , and Tim Tim said that heroes are people who help people even when it 's hard . Yeah ? Well , I need you to be like a hero , Charlie . How ? I need you to be brave and tell me what you saw in your flash-forward . Hey , it 's okay to be afraid . It really is . It 's okay . But if you tell me , you might be able to help me . You might be able to help daddy , help a whole load of people we don 't even know . If I tell--tell you ... s-something bad will happen . No . No , it won 't . Nothing bad 's gonna happen . I promise , okay ? Nothing . Can you tell me what you saw ? Go ahead . It 's your house , too . We were in the kitchen , and Dylan wanted a cookie . Daddy says that you said , " D. Gibbons is a bad man . " Why 'd you say that ? The man you call D. Gibbons lied to you . We heard his dad . He said D. Gibbons lied ... Bad people lie . And Dylan made the magnets say that On the refrigerator . - Bad people lie . But you didn 't see D. Gibbons ? He wasn 't in the house ? Keep going , sweetie . What else did you see ? I heard fireworks , and I went to the back door . I saw a man walk up to another man . They were wearing suits . And he said ... It 's okay , sweetie . You can do it . What did he say ? Mark Benford is dead . " Mark Benford is dead . " " Mark Benford is dead . " It 's not possible . It 's what she heard . " Mark Benford is dead . " That 's why she 's been so frightened to tell us . She 's afraid her daddy 's gonna die . That 's not gonna happen , Olivia . On April 29th , I 'm gonna be in my office at my board , alive . Livy , whatever Charlie saw , what she said- - Oh , God . It 's not that . Then what is it ? That 's just it . This is the part where I tell you that we could escape this . We could go to Denver . We could go anywhere and get away from it all , get away from all of this . And this is the part where you tell me that you won 't . Right . There 's gonna be another blackout . And I have to see this through . I have to try and stop it . I have to try . What happened to the world happened in your village first . At least , that 's our operating theory . Your people didn 't die . They were blacked out . They had prophecies ? That 's what we think . We had hoped to find some of them and talk to them . The war came when I was gone . The people , my mother- - They must have been driven away . I saw the black camel . I thought the devil had taken their souls . The Koran- - Chapter 66 Verse 6 . " Save yourself and your families from a fire whose fuel is men and stones . " I painted it myself as a warning . In all my time , I haven 't been in there . Devil or no , it is an evil place . But there is one thing that can push a man more than fear . - What 's that ? - Destiny . You look like you 've seen a ghost . It 's entirely the opposite . What I designed was theoretical . It could only be done in the future , and yet it 's been standing here for 18 years . Welcome to the future . You said these designs were stolen from you ? This was built in ' 91 , but you didn 't come up with the concept till ' 92 . I don 't know how that 's possible . - Someone must have invented it before you . - No . This is exactly what I designed . I don 't get it . Whoever did this , why would they leave it behind for somebody to find ? - They were hauling these things away . Then the war came . - Why didn 't they ever come back to finish ? The war hasn 't stopped . Found something . It 's a chessboard . It 's been sitting here for 18 years . And we have portable power . Here 's to hoping . What did you see ? I knew this boy . - He was my friend . - What 'd he say ? He said he saw himself playing a game . And did it happen ? He said what he saw came true . What did you see ? This is my mother . She was looking for me . She couldn 't find me , but she had hope . She knew I would survive , that ... I would become great . The preceding interviews from test Group " B " confirm that the subjects uniformly experienced a consciousness shift two weeks into the future . That 's the man who shot at us in Utah . That 's D. Gibbons . D. Gibbons was here ... in 1991 ? Conducting an experiment . You see ? God didn 't have anything to do with this . This was man . Over here ! What are you seeing , Simon ? Simon ! This tunnel - - Vacuum systems , the lead shielding- - it 's a linear accelerator , one of five . Smaller , less powerful versions than the ones we use at N.L.A.P. They ran a pimeter around the village . Somehow they unleashed a tachyon burst , creating a beta test of the global blackout in this village . You weren 't in the village at the time the experiment was conducted , which explains why you didn 't lose consciousness . If what you 're saying is true , it took five accelerators to create this beta blackout . There 's no way that just one knocked out the entire world , right ? - How can you possibly say that ? Technology moves fast , Agent Noh . Even if you knew the rules , which you don 't , I don 't think they apply anymore . I got something down here ! Ready ? Go . I don 't think your people were driven off by the war . They were shot ... executed , all of them . Remote village , wartime . Given all the unrest , they knew nobody would ever find these people . - They showed them tomorrow and ripped it away . You said God had nothing to do with this ... Hooyo ! Hooyo ! That it was man . But it was not any man . It was you . No . Those plans were stolen from me . I said you were sent here for a reason . Now I know what that reason is . God delivered you to me ... - Abdi , no ! So I could avenge my people ! Let your end mark a new beginning ! No ! Oh , my God . " Better Angels . " His vision . This wasn 't supposed to happen . You want some cookies to go with that milk ? No . I want to leave . I want to go away with you and with Charlie . I just want to get away from all of this , from everything that we saw . Yes or no ? Livy ... Yes or no ? You want to say both , don 't you ? It 's who you are , Mark . You can 't have it both ways . This is what we signed on for . You save lives . I save lives . This is how we do it . But we saw how we did it . You 're at your office . I 'm here with Charlie hearing you 've died . I love you , Mark . That doesn 't work for me . This is how it happens . Don 't say that . You see , you need things to play out like you saw . You want them to . You need to . You 're forgetting there 's another part to what we saw ... the part where we 're not together anymore . Livy , I don 't want that . You can 't have it both ways . Yes or no ? Hey . Oh , where 'd you get that ? Abdi 's men . Brutalized his people , but they were too scared to say anything because destiny said he was their leader . We changed their destiny today . Rum ? Yeah . To yet another flash-forward never coming true . You okay ? Yeah , fine . So what ? I don 't have a baby . Who cares ? - Lots of people don 't have babies . - You can still have a baby , Yeah , but I can 't have Willa . You named her . Willa ? That 's nice . Well , I would have . It was supposed to happen this weekend . And now her window 's closed , and ... She 's never gonna get here . God . What ? It 's so stupid . I just saw a mass grave , and all I can think about is a mythical baby . Grave , the baby ... You 're having a circle of life moment , right ? You know , the weekend 's not over . I 'm just saying , if it 's baby-making you need , I will take one for the team . Okay , first of all , no offense , but that 's kind of gross . What ? Second of all , that 's , like , 1,000 % wrong . - Desperate times . - I 'm gay . I will make you gayer . Oh , yeah ? What about Zoey ? Chances are ... I 'm not gonna be around in a couple of months , okay ? I think it 'd be nice if Willa was . Are you serious ? How the hell did you get that ? I fixed their satellite TV . I know you think that I can 't handle weapons , but in my vision ... I was killing a man . - Didn 't even need a gun . - How many fingers did you have ? Enough to do the job . What about you ? What did you see ? Okay . Mark Benford is dead . I was doing my job . What ... are you doing ? I promised our little snowboarder that if he held still for his x-ray , I 'd get him a hundred packets of Graham Crackers . You know , I 've raided every floor , and I 'm still only on 46 . - You are so very good at this . What ? Listening to people , you know , figuring out what they need- - uh , bribing them with baked goods . - It 's gonna make you a really good doctor one day . - Well , I can ace Graham Crackers . It 's organic chemistry I 'm worried about . Here . This is for you . Calculator ? Oh , oh , that 's not just any calculator . No , I bought that my junior year at Duke right before I miraculously passed a physics final , and , um , ever since then- - M.C.A.T.S , med school , board exams , that 's- - that 's been my good luck charm . This is great . Up until today , my good luck charm was a brainy smurf . You really think I can do this , huh ? - Yeah , I really do . - You 're not just saying that to be nice ? Well , I don 't lie , and I 'm not nice . - Four years of college ... - Mm-hmm . - Four years of med school ... - Yeah . Four years of psychiatricesidency ... Psychiatry , huh ? Like you said , I 'm a good listener . Plus I 'm kind of an expert when it comes to dealing with people with problems . - Mm-hmm . So 12 years from now , when I finish my training , we 'll be able to work together . 12 years ? Well , you 'll probably be head of the department by then . Yeah , um , about that ... uh , Nicole ... Earlier today ... I-I lied to you . What do you mean ? I told you that everything was fine with me . It 's not . 12 years from now , I 'm not so sure that I 'm gonna be around . The preceding interviews from test Group " B " confirm that the subjects uniformly experienced a consciousness shift two weeks into the future . What are you doing ? Couldn 't sleep . Just packing up stuff to take back to the bureau . That all ? No . Thinking , little things- - Life , death , fate . Careful not to ponder thinking , little too much . The ancient Greeks did it all the time- - - Usually ended up dead . - Well , all of them wound up dead . What the hell ? Hello , Demetri . My name is Dyson Frost , and I 'm recording this message in 1991 . Got your attention , didn 't I ? Major Edited by Jazli and Ralfko

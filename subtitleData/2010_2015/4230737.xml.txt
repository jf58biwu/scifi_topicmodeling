So exactly how much stuff are you giving away ? I don 't know . Whatever you guys don 't want , we 'll send ' em to the homeless shelter . And this is part of your therapy ? Rosen 's idea . I 've accumulated a lot of things throughout the years . Hmm . Pushing people ? Rosen thinks surrounding myself with ill-gotten gains keeps me hooked into my old lifestyle , my old patterns . Does anyone have dibs on the Blu-ray ? Yeah , Patti , what 's up ? Yeah , okay . Just one second . A seminar on police tactics ? All my buddies at the ATF take it . Well , this is hostage rescuing . " Breach and clear . " What the hell is breach and clear ? Well , that 's my point . I 've told you a million times . - We have to be prepared . - Yeah , first badges . Hmm ? And now this mandate ? Just read the thing . Let me know what you think . Slots are filling fast . I need to book this . Wait , wait , Bill . " Multiple threat assessment " ? I mean , what is this ? Jacketed versus hollow point ? Seriously , can you imagine me firing an AK-47 , much less Gary ? Gary 's a special case , okay ? But you- - I 've never fired a gun in my life . And that 's a conscious choice . It 's time for you to make some new choices . Looking for anything in particular ? Yeah , a going away present for my kid . Tyler 's leaving ? Patti wants a fresh start , so she 's , uh , she 's movin ' back to Nevada . And she 's taking Tyler with her . Ah , sorry to hear that , Cameron . That--that 's terrible . Yeah , well , when you go into a custody hearing with a couple of DUIs , you ... don 't normally win . You 're not thinking of giving your son that , are you ? You know , I , uh , I haven 't really ... been to too many meetings lately . I think that 's an excellent idea . Uh , Gary , you 're supposed to take your shoes off . No , no , I like it this way . It 's all buzzy . Do you have one where I can lie down ? No . Get one . Give it to me . Hey , do you guys know where Hicks is ? Yeah , he just left . No ... No , no . I ... I had it all planned out . I was gonna take Omar from the gym , but then him and his boyfriend decided to go on a cruise last minute and ... Hicks was my backup plan and ... and now I don 't know what to do . You should get a foot massager . It 's very therapeutic . This one has 15 settings and a shiatsu mode . I-I don 't want a foot massager , Gary . I could help if I knew what you were talking about . My sister , she 's having her engagement party , and if I show up without a date , my mother is gonna auction me off . Okay , well , take Harken . Isn 't he a little old ? Plus , he 's married . That 's just weird . So Rosen 's out . Isn 't there someone you can push ? I mean , the express mail guy 's gonna be here in 15 minutes . Look , Nina , if I don 't find a date , I 'm gonna spend the rest of the year going on blind dates with third cousins . My feet are so happy . It 's just desperate . Desperate times ... Thanks , Margaret . That was real . Anyone else like to share ? Cameron ? Cameron ... If I may ... I 'd like to say something . Yeah , go for it . My name is Jonas . - I am not an alcoholic . - Whoa . We said at the start no sharing unless you 're one of us . I may not have experienced your pain personally , but I can help you . How many people here are happy ? Truly happy ? Look , Gil asked you nicely . Are you happy ? You don 't look it . That 's it . It 's time to go . I have my answer . And I have your answer . Yeah , it 's pretty . There 's really good food . There 's gifts . Yeah . Is that Rachel with a boy ? Her poor mother . They 're all talking about us . Yeah , of course they are . We 're special . I should go congratulate Sari , and remember , we 've only been dating for two weeks . Yeah , Rachel , I memorized the cover story . I 'm a professional government agent . Yes , I know , Gary . Just please don 't say that to anyone else , okay ? - Okay . - Oh , and thank you . You 're really helping . Rachel ! - Pa . - I didn 't think you 'd come . Salam . I know how it is between you and your sister . That 's--that 's a wool and silk blend . - It 's Italian . - What , you know your fabrics ? Your family in the business ? Heh , I like jackets . Then you should wear one . You 're sick . You know , sick people shouldn 't come to parties . It 's rude . Papa , are you all right ? Yes , it 's nothing , Rachel . It 's nothing to worry about . It 's a cough . No , there 's definitely something wrong . Oh . Please , Rachel , not now with the smells . No ... that 's her ability . That 's what makes her special . Gary ... - Her synesthesia . - Gary , stop . I 'm glad I don 't have it , though . I don 't- - I don 't like smells . Gary , you 're not helping . What is it ? Is something wrong ? Look ... I 'm sorry , mom . I don 't mean to upset anybody , it 's just ... Papa , you need to go to the doctor . Right away . Enough . Not here , not now . Enough ! - I 'm not kidding ! - Enough ! This is a special day for your sister . Please , don 't ruin it . Do we go back to the office now ? Yeah . Hicks , it 's , like , 7 : 00 a.m. I know . My God , you look beautiful . Are you okay ? I 'm more than okay . Nina , my life ... my life finally makes sense . But you know how it is . I mean , you go along , and things are one way and ... I don 't know , you just start to think that they 're always gonna be that way , but ... but then , one day , out of nowhere , it 's different . Well , you definitely seem different . I want you to come with me , Nina . Listen , there 's something- - I wanna show you something . It is amazing . What about work ? We can be late for one day . Come on . Do this for me . Okay . Okay . So what is it you want to show me ? Not that I don 't enjoy the tour . I want you to meet my friend Jonas . They said he 'll be out soon . He 's preparing to speak at a big gathering this weekend . There 's gonna be thousands of people . Sounds like a big shot . I 'm telling you , Nina , there 's something about this guy . Something different . Something you have to experience for yourself . Wait , are you saying that ... you 've experienced firsthand what this Jonas can do ? Jonas can make you see things in a new light , I promise you . These people look pushed . Is Jonas an Alpha ? Nina , I 'm happy . First time I 'm actually happy . I just--I want you to be happy too . That 's it . We 're out of here . Hello . Trouble in paradise ? Jonas , this is my friend Nina I was telling you about . And I 'm ... afraid she 's not sure if she wants to be here . I know I don 't . How can you know anything ? You 've only just arrived . You 're gonna tell me what 's going on here . What you 're doing to all these people . Cameron told me about you . The wonderful things you can do . It 's not working . Cameron ... - Trust me , Nina . - Get us out of here . You 're gonna thank me . Rachel , did you get me the hummus ? You promised me the leftover hummus . Bottom shelf , Gary . Oh , ah . I like hummus . 'Cause it 's all one color , and it 's soft . Is your father at the hospital ? Did you get the test results ? He didn 't go . He won 't listen to me . No , but he has to listen to you . Otherwise--otherwise , he 'll just get sicker . And then--and if you get too sick , then you die , and then it 's too late . Gary , I can 't talk about this with you , okay ? No , but you have to talk to me , because I 'm pretending to be your boyfriend . I don 't think you 'd understand , Gary . - My family- - - No , I--you don 't understand . Rachel , uh ... I always say what 's on my mind . And you should learn from me . Yeah . You have to go , and you have to tell your father the truth . And then you have to keep telling him . You have to keep telling him the truth until he pays attention . Just like I do with Bill . Or like this , like I 'm doing it with you now . Rachel , come on . You gotta- - you gotta go and you gotta tell him . And I won 't stop talking to you until you do go . Okay ? Okay , Gary . Okay . I 'm looking out for you . What happened to him ? Nothing to alarm here . Everyone back to work . He looks sick . Sometimes the darkness overwhelms my followers . I think he needs a doctor . A doctor wouldn 't understand what we 're trying to accomplish here or what 's attacking this man . Our boss , Dr. Rosen , he understands us . He 'd understand you . Hello . Are you here to see father ? Well , that depends . Uh , who is your father ? Jonas . He 's everyone 's father . Daddy used to be my father , but they had to burn daddy up when he got sick . We practice cremation . Environmentally , it 's more responsible than burial . Father , I want to see the lights ! Can I see the lights ? Not now , Teddy . Go find your friends , okay ? You must be Jonas . Dr. Rosen , I hope you 're as competent as Nina and Cameron say you are . I expected them to meet me here . Uh , I should probably speak with them . Don 't you want to see your patients first ? Patients ? Um , plural ? Uh , Mr. Hicks didn 't go into that much detail on his call . He just said that I was the , uh , the only one who could help . It 's much more complicated than that . This is it . How long has this man been like this ? A week or so . We can force him to eat and drink a little . But eventually , they waste away . And then others ? Some longer , some less . These people need to be in a hospital . Can 't you help them ? I can certainly try . I ... Oh . For starters , this man needs IV fluids . He 's extremely dehydrated . And this woman is ... this woman is dead . She 's been dead for hours . I 've seen it so often . I try to stop it . I try to keep them safe from the world . But ... it 's everywhere , the enemy . I 'm not sure I 'm quite following you . I show them the truth behind the world . It 's my gift . I let them see the light ... The interconnectedness of all things , all people . You 're an Alpha . Nina and Cameron , they said you 'd understand that- - Uh , yes , I have , uh , studied people like you , uh , quite extensively . Perhaps you could describe what exactly it is you do . Perhaps I could show you . No , I don 't think that would be a good idea right now . It 'll make you happy and content . I don 't need to be happy or content at the moment . I need to be very focused . People are very sick . You would rather live in darkness ? Uh , yes , for now . Uh ... Could I see Mr. Hicks and Ms. Theroux ? I think talking to them would be very helpful . This way . Doc . Oh , this is a bit awkward . Uh , Nina , don 't get up on my account . It 's , uh--would you excuse us for a moment , please ? Don 't take too long . Those people downstairs need you . Uh , this might be stating the obvious , but this man has used his Alpha ability on you . Jonas doesn 't call it an ability . He says it 's a divine gift . There 's this light , this light of the world , and it 's in all of us . It connects us . Look , Doc , I know it 's hard to understand that it 's there , but once Jonas explains it to you , you 'll see it . Everything just makes sense . This might seem all quite miraculous to you , but what you 're experiencing has nothing to do with the divine . This is a result of his ability . His Alpha ability . You should let him show you . Uh ... well , maybe I will , Nina . Um , but , uh ... not right now . Uh , right now , I need you to put on some clothes , and come back to the office with me . Clearly , we have a lot to discuss . But I don 't want to do it here . I don 't get it . I mean , I thought this is what you wanted for us- - for us to find peace . You should be happy for us . I am ... believe me . But we should go . Cell phones are a distraction . Part of the white noise of the world that keeps us from truly knowing each other . I see . Have you blocked the signal somehow or- - We disabled the only tower for miles . The patients are waiting . Heh . You 're curing them . Uh , diagnosing them . I-I believe these people are suffering from a form of encephalitis lethargica . It 's a condition which attacks the brain and leaves the individual speechless and , well , emotionless . Let me ask you something . When you share your ability with these people , they see things , right ? Light and , uh , angels that they draw ? They perceive the luminous . There 's a neurological explanation for all of this . Are you familiar with the pineal gland ? Overstimulation can induce hallucinations , brilliant visions , and often , an overwhelming sense of well being . You think you can quantify everything . Put it into a little box . If you 'd just let me show you , you 'd see . Well , you run the risk of turning your doctor into another patient . Th-there is , however , a medication which could help- - L-Dopa . I can run out right now and bring some right back . I 'll send someone . How much do you need ? Well , they 'll only give it to a doctor . So write a prescription . Last drop-off is 10 : 00 p.m. Pop ! Rachel ! It 's late , don 't you have work in the morning ? Yeah . Look ... Back home in Tehran , when you were a doctor ... what would you do if a patient wouldn 't listen to your recommendation ? But you 're not a doctor . And I haven 't been one for a very long time . Papa , you 're sick . And you need to get help . Rachel ... I 'm tired . I want my dinner . Hey . Hey . Listen to me . When Sari and Darius and I were little and we got sick , you brought us our medicine . You made sure we got our sleep . You never left our side . You 're my children . And you 're my papa . And , papa , you have cancer . In your throat . And if you don 't do something about it soon , you will die . You will not see your grandchildren . You will not walk me down the aisle . You 'll be gone . All because you were too stubborn to listen to your loved ones . - I- - - Now ... are you gonna go to the doctor ? Or do I have to talk to mom ? You were such a quiet , obedient child . I 'm not a child anymore . Tomorrow , okay ? Or I 'm coming back . Oh , no ! Shoot . Dr. Rosen ... Jonas is looking for you . Maria Parsonetti came to us a drug-addicted runaway . She ascends now . May her soul be blessed as it returns to the great light . And together , we say ... Amen . That woman didn 't have to die . And you 're going to have to burn a lot more bodies before this is done . This is how it 's always been . If these people 's lives mean anything to you , make sure it ends differently this time . Pop , I 'm so glad . You let me know as soon as you get the test results . Promise ? Pop , I don 't need to be protected , I need the truth . Okay . Did you ask if there 's any more hummus ? I really like the hummus . Gary , I will get my mom to make you as much hummus as you want . Guys , guys , guys . Where is everybody ? I 'm calling--phones , texting--no one 's answering . Dr. Rosen never turned up to drive me . He didn 't pick you up this morning ? No , my mom had to drive me . And she said that I made her late for work , but she made me late for work too . You know , Nina didn 't come home last night . And , actually , she hasn 't returned any of my texts . I think I heard her leave with Hicks yesterday morning . - Gary , can you please try- - - Yeah , yeah , Bill . Ping ping ping . Out of area , out of area , out of area . What does that mean ? It means out of area . It means no one 's near a tower . - What , all three of them ? - Yeah , it 's weird . 'Cause I can only ping them if they 're near a tower . Gary , you 're gonna have to figure out something else . I 'll check Dr. Rosen 's computer . Bill , did you know his password is ... - No , I don 't know ... - S-W-1 ... - Gary ... - M-M-3-R . It 's " swimmer , " but it 's numbers instead of vowels . Let 's go check the computer first . It 's clever . I set it up . That doesn 't seem to be working . Eh ... I could increase the dosage , but I 'm afraid it might kill her . Maybe it 's meant to be . Um ... Mr. Englin , uh ... you said it 's always been like this . When was the first time this happened around you ? I was very young . My father was a preacher . He was the first person I gifted . And he realized I 'd been given ... A divine calling . So he brought you in to the family business , so to speak . I was helping people . Yeah . The entire congregation was grateful . And then ... people started getting sick . People you 'd gifted ? My father said it was the devil 's work . That the darkness was trying to steal back my gift . He prayed on it . And he saw how to save everyone . Well , how exactly did he do that ? He purified his congregation . With fire . It 's--it 's working . Here , take some more . Did I do anything stupid ? All I remember is glowy lights and feeling really , really good . Like a speed ball , but ... way better . I gave you insight . Not a drug . Call it what you want , but put that in a bottle , I 'd crawl right inside . Do you feel any connection at all with that man ? Or anyone else right now ? I just wanna go home . That could be a problem . Yep . - Right here . - Yeah , right . - Bill ... Bill ... - Yeah ? Dr. Rosen 's last Google . It shows that he went to Connecticut , to a house that used to belong to Fred Bask . And he--he was old , and he died . And then he gave his house away as a gift . To the Reverend Jonas Englin . He 's some sort of a religious leader . Yeah , and he 's speaking tomorrow at a big church- - - Wait , wait , wait . So Rosen is with a religious group ? What the hell is going on ? Excuse me , where 's the medication that was here ? Father took it away . Of course I took it . Gil may live , but your poison robbed him of my gift . Mr. Englin , your gift is what is killing those people . That is a lie . It 's not me . It 's the world ! It 's the darkness ! I understand that you 're going to be speaking to some sort of religious gathering . To spread the light , yes . It 's what I was meant to do . And you 're going to expose all these people to your--your ability ? Dr. Rosen ... you 've seen the pain . The indignities all around us . The terrible things the unenlightened do to themselves and others . I can change that . Or is this broken world enough for you ? Making people sick , killing them , it- - that 's not gonna fix anything . So will you please give me back this medicine so that I can help your people ? Do you know what the worst part of my gift is ? I can 't feel it . Like you , I 'm trapped in the darkness . I would sacrifice everything , even my life , to experience for just one moment what I give to others . So tell me what 's better- - a lifetime of suffering or a short time in paradise ? You don 't have the right to make that choice for people ! Well , neither do you . No more poison . You 'll have to come up with another answer . Find a way to give my people paradise and life ... or the others are gonna die too ... including Nina and Cameron . Stop . This is the address on Rosen 's computer . Okay , I 'm picking up a lot of heartbeats , 40 or 50 , at least . Do you at least hear Rosen or Hicks or Nina ? No , it 's too far , even for me . These dead bodies look like barbecued chicken . Gary , not appropriate . This guy scares me . Like Jim Jones scary . Well , let 's just hope he hasn 't started handing out the purple kool-aid . Rachel , I need a visual on an entry . Front door is covered . There 's some windows low on the side that nobody 's watching- - we can go in that way . Well , no , no , no , no . I 'll go in alone , okay ? - No ! - Bill , no . I go alone . If you don 't hear from me in 20 minutes , you call tactical . Let ' em know it 's a hostage situation , okay ? - Bill , that 's wrong . - Let ' em know- - under no circumstances are you to follow me in here , Gary . But ... Okay . Okay . Doc ! Bill . Bill , you 've got to get out of here . Right now . Bill ... Nina ... Give me the gun . And come with me . Nina ... Nina ! Nina , don 't do this ! Nina ! Okay . Tactical 's on their way . No , you have to sterilize my phone when you use it . - Gary , I 'm sorry , my- - - Bacteria . Ear wax . I know , I know . I 'm sorry , my phone does not work up here . Here , it 's clean . Thank you . This is wrong , though . Bill needs us . I bet he 's in trouble right now . We should just go in . Hey , no . Bill said no . I don 't hear any gunshots , and there 's no fighting . We wait . The police are coming here ? It 's not the police , it 's D.O.D. , so ... that means assault rifles , flak jackets and armored vehicles and helicopters and ... I 'm sorry , I didn 't- - I didn 't know that- - You can call them off , right ? No , I can 't . They think it 's a hostage situation . They think I 'm a hostage , and , oh , and Hicks and Nina and Dr. Rosen . I must pray on this . We 'll be all right . You guys have been holding out on me , huh ? I had no idea ... I needed this . I know . Everyone should feel this way . Everyone will . You were a mistake . I never should have agreed to bring you here . N-no , you were right to bring me here . You wanted to help these people , and so do I. I just need more time . Time ? To find a treatment ? Or time for your government thugs to invade my home ? No one wants any violence . I can bring peace to the entire world . Why would I let anyone stand in my way ? Jonas , you are so much more than your ability . Your message about connectedness and that there 's a light in all of us , that is worth hearing . Those are just words . Without my gift , they 're just words . - Words have power . - No ! You want to make me into a charlatan . Faith healing and revival tents and bless you for this donation . Jonas , your ability is killing these people . I gave these people paradise . Once they experience it , they can 't let it go . How do you know ? Have you asked any of them ? What about Gil ? He was ready to drink again . You 're asking me to let you tear it away from them ? - No . - I 'd rather die first . So would they . My father understood that . I never did until today . This time , I won 't run from the flames . You 'll burn too . But you 'll never know paradise . Hey . You wanna try to give me a hand ? Gettin ' lazy on me , Bill ? No , I ... I amped up , but it didn 't work . - All right . - It 's weird . Cameron ? Cameron ... Cameron ... What 's wrong ? He 's been called . We all have . Oh , jeez . Don 't be afraid . You came to me broken , looking for answers . From the pain that infects this world . And I healed you . I showed you the light . The connection , not just to each other , but to something greater than ourselves . The outside world doesn 't understand it . They think everyone should live in fear and darkness . It frightens them that we live free and without worry . And now they are beating down our walls , trying to destroy what we 've built here . It can 't happen today . Today , the light that shines from me shines for us all . Join me in the light . And we 'll spend eternity together . What are you doing ? It 's alright . Dr. Rosen ... take your poison out of here . Put the torch into the furnace , Jonas , please . This is the only way out ! Please do it . Lee ... 500 milligrams to as many people as you can . - Nina , don 't listen to him . - No , no . - No , just don 't move . - Nina , no . You can 't control them anymore . I 'm not gonna let you bring darkness into my house . Don 't do this , Jonas . Hey . Jonas 's victims are responding to the L-Dopa , like you said they would . I think tactical 's got everything under control . We can go . Oh , I see him . Stop . Dad ! Dad . I talked to mom . She said cancer . Stage one . It 's very treatable . They never catch it this early . But then ... no one else has a daughter like you . I 'm so glad . You 're a miracle . Now ... your Aunt Parashtou . She 's coming to dinner . Okay . Uh , she 's got a mole she needs you to look at . Okay . Hey . Hey . So ... group should be interesting today . We 're not gonna talk about it , right ? What happened between us . I figure that 's a private conversation . I 'll just pretend it never happened . I 'll talk about Tyler , how he 's leaving and , uh , how I can 't stop it . Still can 't believe Rosen saw us naked . Doc , you ready ? We 're waiting on you . In a minute . You okay ? Am I okay ? Well ... I killed a man , Bill . No , you killed a bad guy and saved a whole lot of folks from being barbecued . That 's the part you hold onto . How does it feel ? The light . Oh , I , um ... never felt better in my life . I mean , I still can 't amp up , and I 'm glad to be among the breathing , but ... You know , Bill ... the D.O.D. is going to cover this whole thing up . If you kill someone , you should pay a price . You are definitely paying the price . So why don 't we just go and ... Talk about it with the group , or ... not , or ... Okay , Dr. Harken . Alright , then ... here 's some advice ... next time aim for the chest . It 's an easier stop . I was aiming for his chest . = = sync , corrected by elderman = =

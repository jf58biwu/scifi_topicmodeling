Peep this replay of him going eggs , " Benedict Arnold " on teammate Jenny Matrix . Brian , check it . Ki invented a brunch of pizza . She calls it , get this , a " quiche " . I already told you , it 's just a coincidence ! Isn 't she amazing , dude ? You guys are great together . You would never betray one another . Oh , man , I suck . You 're still beating up over that Jenny Matrix thing ? Nah I 'm over it . That 's the ' tude , dude . It 's a new day . Carpe Diem . Carpe Diem . Carpe Diem . Let 's get to class . That last run felt a little half baked shot bot but one thing 's for sure , any way you slice this melon , Brian D 's chances of making JV at tryouts are over , easy . I 'm Scott Slanders , and I 'm drun ... Ki , that 's ... a 4000 hit combo I helped my parents design this game . Let 's play again . No no no ! I 've had .. I 've had quite enough . You already made me quite the Brian D. Let 's play again . Brian D ? More like Brian Z. The last letter in the alphabet . Ooo yeah ! Don 't even listen to him dude . Ted , please , I don 't even .. know what that means . Well Z is the la ... You know I don 't even have time to explain to you how sick of a burn ... Ted ? Ted ! What happened ? You okay ? You passed out for like 27 minutes ! I 'm fine . I just ... You 've seen them haven 't you Theodore ? Hi Drift King . The visions . What are they ? Merely a side effect ... of drift fever ! You 've got the blood Ted ! You can 't escape this now ! Cast off that silly little plastic guitar , and grip the steering wheel of destiny ! Forget it DK . Us Wongs are bred to shred . I 'm signing up for rythm gaming and there 's nothing you can do to stop me ! Confound it ! Why must you Brian D your future way on this dying sport ? Look at me in the eye . Tell me how hammer-ons and pull-ups can possibly compare to the G force pull of an A + J turn ? The thrum of a rumble chair as you careen past the checkered flag ... The churning in your chest , as you hear those three magical words : NEW-LAP-RECORD . Got .. a class , I gotta go to class . Yoga class , let 's go ! That 's on thursday . I don 't care . Let 's go . Okay ! Ted , even a man as fast as you can 't run away from himself forever ! Hey buddy , look , I got you ... uh . Ah , my thanks ted 's vassal . Though in the future , I prefer , sour cream and onions . Who are you ? Hey there champ . How are you holding up ? Great , great , yeah totally great . Yeah , this is nothing compared to our old school , those old guys really knew how to haze . Really ? Well , I guess we 'll just have to step it up a notch then . JK , I 'm just rattling you , bro ! So ... you good ? Good ? Yeah , No , I 'm great , you know , it 's totally great . You 're great , I 'm great , you 're with the Law , that 's great , by the way . I 'm by myself , that 's great .

The school took a risk on you Brian . You let us down . Have a seat , kid . Sir . Sir , I know I screwed up at scrimmage , but I figured with try-outs still right around the corner VGHS try-outs are streamed across the world . And you 're one point away from expulsion . Administration doesn 't like those odds . So what are you saying ? I 'm saying you 're circling the drain We don 't need some kid Brian D-ing all over our reputation . That new catchphrase is the exact reason why administration is asking you to ragequit on your own accord . We 're asking you to - that 's a good coffee - we 're asking you ... to leave VGHS . Hey ! Kick back the hover ball ! Tough day Brian ? Oh hey Games ! What do you want ? Just wondered if you dropped this . How did you get that ? Well it 's a funny story . I told you . Stick to Games . I 'm totally a catch . That 's my favorite game ! No baby . That 's our favorite game . Great . Well , enjoy the game . Oh I will . But not as much as Jenny will enjoy your cute little : Oh , I like you but I don 't have the balls to say so note.Well per chance the Law will succomb to your " Don Juan " thing marksmanship . Are you kidding me ? This place is ridiculous ! It 's my time in the spotlight Brian ! And you 're standing in my way . It 's Game 's time . Wow ! It 's Game 's time ! That 's cute . You got yourself a little brand . I like that . You know what Games ? You want the spotlight ? You can have it ! But first here 's what we 're gonna do . We 're going to throw it down.I 'm gonna stomp your face . I 'm gonna make you cry , in front of your two ... stupid friends whose names I don 't even wanna know . You see Games , I 'm one point away from expulsion . And I 'm gonna use that point on all 3 of you noobs . I figured you 'd say something like that . Assault rifles ? Oh , let 's get an SMG in there . You funeral . Best at three ? First to five ! Games on . See ya ! I 'm destroying you ! What are you doing here ? Saving your ass . Yeah , well , it 's a little late . Dammit Brian , what the hell are you doing ? I 'm leaving on my own accord . Yeah , I set you up . But you know what ? You wanted to be in that game , and you screwed it up . So you can blame me , you can blame the whole damn school . But right here , right now , it is all on you . Let 's dance . But ... but it was Games ' time ! This isn 't over Brian D. Crownies ? Let 's roll . Thanks for the assist . Yeah , you 're welcome . You should play like that more often . See you at sign-ups tomorrow . You can kiss your high scores , good bye ! Yeah , good luck with that captain . Hey Jenny , thanks for giving me a shot . No matter how cool your are , better practice those 5-star songs if you plan on taking me on . Brian .

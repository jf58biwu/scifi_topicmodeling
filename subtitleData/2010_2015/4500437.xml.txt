 You cold ? No . When I 'm with you , it doesn 't bother me . Mariko ... you look your best when you 're smiling . Logan ! Logan ! One year later Dammit ! You want another cold one ? You were late , and I figured you got distracted chasing a skirt , so I went looking for you ... Asano . Logan ! And I find you hanging out with a buncha Advanced Idea Mechanics scum instead of trying to score . Dunno whether to be happy or sad about that . Logan ! Welcome to New York . I 'm glad you found me Logan . Been about ten years , eh ? I wanted you to take a look at something . Mariko ... ! I wanted to tell you where she is . She disappeared into thin air one day . How 'd you find her ? Kuzuryu ... the Nine-Headed Dragon . They 're the largest organized crime group in Japan , and they 've quietly been providing A.I.M. With a foundation for their operations throughout all of Asia . And this man ... He 's the head of the Kuzuryu . Yashida Shingen . He doesn 't just sit in the Don 's chair either ... I 've heard he 's a sword expert who doesn 't hesitate to cut his way through a shootout . Your girl is Shingen 's daughter . What ? ! We 've been monitoring Shingen 's activities ... It 's been impossible to catch him red-handed , but we in the Metro-PD 's special task force have been trying to prosecute Shingen and dissolve the Kuzuryu for a long time . So where 's Mariko ? ! She 's gotten engaged with a certain man ... Or rather , her engagement was arranged ... This is him . Kurohagi Hideki . What 's this ? This is an island where the world 's criminal organizations have cooperated to establish a sovereign city-state ... The most lawless city in the world ... Madripoor . The person who owned the majority of the island died last year , and the person who succeeded him was his son , Kurohagi Hideki . If he and Yashida Shingen join forces , Shingen will get to expand his international operations , and Kurohagi will get a important financial backer . She 's probably being dragged into a political marriage to broker the deal ... She was forcibly taken from New York , and is now being confined by her father in Tokyo . In Tokyo ? What 's wrong ? You looked sad . You never ask anything about me ... I 've never been one to live in the past , or the future ... The present is the thing I care about the most . That 's part of why you 're so kind ... Logan , I ... ! You look your best when you 're smiling . Logan ... Seems like Mariko 's father and past are keeping her from me and her present ... Logan 's going past the front door . He 's deviating from the plan , Asano-san ! Well if he tries going through the front door , they 'll just throw a wall of bodies in his way . We 'll leave it in Logan 's hands for now . Logan 's missing ! I lost sight of him when he went around the back ! Did he go inside ? I can 't say for sure . This is bad ! Illegal trespassing ... It 's fine ! I 'll take responsibility for it . Logan ... I 've tapped into the Shingen estate 's security cameras . Mariko ! Father .. ? Is something wrong , chief ? Shingen ... I suppose these expensive electronic eyes are no match for a warrior 's perception . Logan ! Where 'd he come from ? ! What 're you going to do now , Logan ? Logan ... the famed Wolverine . I guess I oughta be proud that you 've heard of me . You 're after my daughter , I presume ? That saves me the trouble of explaining myself . I wanna see Mariko smiling again . I leave her here and that smile 's gonna be locked up in a closet . She 's already engaged . I don 't care . Are you as formidable as I 've heard ? Why don 't you give it a shot , bub ? Logan ! Dispose of him ! I see . I 'm taking Mariko . Logan ... Will you face me ? Face you ? If you beat me , you can take my daughter . You wanna have it out with katanas ? Don 't be vulgar ! We will compete with wooden swords . I can 't get footage from inside . I think they 've got it protected . This is bad ! Shingen 's a master swordsman . Wooden sword or not , the tip of his blade can approach supersonic speeds , and even without landing a blow he could pulverize him ! Logan ! I guess you really are a master with a sword ... Logan ! You sure that thing 's made of wood ... ? To mask your own incompetence by claiming our tools are different ! I 've had enough of you ! I ain 't done ! I 'm taking Mariko with me ! This is a drug that A.I.M. just developed , that paralyzes the central nervous system at high speed . You son of a ... She 's gotten engaged with a certain man . Kurohagi Hideki . Faster than your famous " healing factor , " even . Kurohagi-san ! That 's cheating ! Cheating ? I simply put him on even footing with your father , Mariko-san . You 'll be able to focus on me , without distractions . Logan ! Chief , finish him off . I can tell you this much : I 'm not your enemy . Father ... I 'll do as you say . I 'll make ... I 'll make Shingen pay . Next Time on Wolverine : Yukio .

 when many planets intermingled and the boundary between man and god was vague ... a tale of love and rebirth . 1017 ) } Kyousou { \ cHFCFDFB } gi { \ cH000000 } ga Someone in the employ of the Shrine shouldn 't speak of destroying the world so lightly . It 's not that I don 't care about the Shrine or the other planes . I 'm just wondering if there 's some way we can work this out . Let 's All Think About What We Can Do ! Chapter 25 : The Present ( 19 ) / Inari A but our job at the Shrine is to act on behalf of God to maintain the balance in the planes . Unified Planetary Organization { \ cH737391 } The Shrine and the dead outside the barrier . This was all decided at the beginning . The existence of a 13th planet violates the laws of the universe . It cannot be allowed . You were there . You heard it . Or did you just happen to forget it as you reincarnated your soul ? but nobody said anything to me . Stop this . God can 't be allowed to intervene . Then how did the Looking Glass City manage to exist for this long ? why hasn 't it been a problem before now ? so how was he able to create it ? Why am I able to be here with my mom and everyone else ? why is it possible ? Chief Priest ? I can 't agree that this place shouldn 't exist ! I don 't want to pretend it never existed . I don 't want to renounce the world I see . and the world I 've found . Chief Priest . I 'm sure I ... I won 't be able to see anything anymore . Koto ... Koto ! you 're wonderful ! the most blessed miracle of all ! Sensei ... what 's gotten into you ? Koto . I 'm God . What ? what do you mean ? There 's something that 's always bothered me . too . and our dad . so he hid himself away and left me and the Chief Priest with a ton of work . I can 't really blame him . We were basically created by him . so we 'll do what he wants . And it 's not like there was anything else to do . The Chief Priest created subcontractors to control and unite the worlds . I helped him at first . and it was a job worth doing . This was before it was even given the name " Shrine . There were these huge lizards back then ! It was a fun time . I liked it . it came to an end . and my older brother and I spent our days just doing our jobs . as you know . but I was a little different . it was interesting . strange orders would arise that we had nothing to do with . Don 't you think that 's weird ? but things we knew nothing about were happening on their own . things simply got beyond our control . and nothing ever worked out . we didn 't even know what " worked out " meant anymore . it all seemed stupid to me . There was no way I was going to like my brother . So I decided I would do whatever I wanted . of course . wasn 't I ? Brother ? Dad ? You don 't usually talk this much . How could I keep quiet ? my job from the start was the creation of life . So something being born from somebody besides me was a little bit of an accident . I thought it was disgusting . to put it mildly . The idea of another me coming out from another person made me sick . and yet not me ! And the rules of life meant that there was no way to change this . don 't you think ? everything happens as God wills it . so wonderful ! Koto ! I decided that if this wonderful girl I would entrust her with the wish that I couldn 't fulfill for myself ! you 've grown beyond my wildest hopes and dreams ! you are the other me that I wanted ! and show me the answer . Kyousou { \ cHEAFEF5 } gi { \ cH000000 } ga Chapter 26 : The Present ( 20 ) / Inari B What are you thinking ? Just what she said . using this place as my base . Chief Priest ! Chief Priest ! Chief Priest ? Return to the Shrine . But ... Inari ... I 'm sorry . What did you do to her — Koto . I 'll explain later . That which shines and so is divine . Your light will make a crack in this twisted world . Are you really the priest ? Were you surprised to find yourself with a little sister ? Isn 't Koto cute ? You didn 't come back to us ? We 're not going to all live here together ? I 've been waiting for you to come back . This whole time . and then ... And then it could all be over . But ... You haven 't used them ? I left them for you . I was just holding on to them ! It 's always been like that . these beads ... I didn 't want any of them ! I 'm sick of your whims ruling my life ! Didn 't you promise that this would be the last time ? ! bringing the beginning and the end . But all you ever bring is the end . Koto ! You 're exactly right . All I 've brought with me today is the end . So why don 't you be the beginning ? Everyone is here ! Myoue ! Kyousou { \ cHEAFEF5 } gi { \ cH000000 } ga Chapter 27 : The Present ( 21 ) / Myoue Yakushimaru ! Yakushimaru ! Yakushimaru ! Yakushimaru ! Yakushimaru ! Yakushimaru ! Yakushimaru ! Yakushimaru ! Yakushimaru ! Kurama ... How can you sleep at a time like this ? We should 've ditched this idiot and ran ! can he ? What ? There 's no point in saying anything now . What is my father thinking ? let 's get out of here . If only I had my remote control ... then what ? Does it matter anymore ? What else can we do ? nothing will change . It 'll just get worse . Even Koto 's gone crazy . Now what do we do ? Myoue . It might be easier for us if we just stay buried . Myoue ! Wha — Enough . How long are you going to sit there and sulk ? Don 't expect anything from others . your world never will . Stop brooding over a past that 's dead and gone . created to make you feel better . right ? Myoue ! Myoue . The Council of Three was simply a cradle for you until you accepted that . You must leave this comfortable womb ... don 't you ? Myoue ! Don 't look down . Myoue . The task you must do isn 't in the past . Look straight ahead . Go forward . Don 't worry . Your past won 't disappear . Yakushimaru . You 're late . I 'm sorry . But I brought all the repair materials that were left . let 's go ! too . fake monk . that is . I 'll go on ahead . You can do what you want . it 's brighter outside than in a hole ... Kind of funny . I wonder ? our boat lingered dreamily ... pleased a simple tale to hear . slain by cold autumn frosts . that girl beneath those skies ? Yase ? Look at that light ! It 's so pretty ! Can you go get it for me ? No . That 's a shame . You should stop sitting there and run — Run where ? It 's fine . I like this place . is all . What about you ? Why are you here ? It just happened that way . I see . do you ? Yase ... but you never wanted this city to die . I never minded you being Myoue . dreaming as the days go by . and all that is left are dreams . lingering in the golden gleam . what is it but a dream ? Thanks . Koto ! You 're crying again ? You cry a lot more than I 'd have thought . actually . Myoue ... Hey . Myoue ? Myoue ! what do I do ? The world 's going to end and it 's my fault ! it won 't . I won 't let it . Probably . there was something he left us besides his promise . The power of creation that he had . Myoue ... I don 't want it to just end like this . I 'm sorry I said you were the end . you are my beginning . Kyousou { \ cHFCFDFB } gi { \ cH000000 } ga It was so long ! It was so fun ! I 'm so hungry ! Can I die ? I want to go outside . Mom ! I love you ! Everyone 's so lively today . Did something happen ? I heard . No ! Next time on Kyousougiga : Busy Life Special Move : Finale !

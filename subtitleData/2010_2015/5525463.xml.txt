 There is an infinite number of universes . In each of them , there is a version of us . Just because you walked in my shoes , don 't you think that you know me . Maybe you are just incapable of trust . Coming from the person who stole my life . I 've torn holes in both the universes so that we can begin to work together to fix ... You were right . They don 't remember Peter . He served his purpose . The timeline has been rewritten , and yet traces of him continue to bleed through . He was here and then he was gone . I saw him . Tell me about the day the picture was taken . I think I was 6 years old . We 'd go camping in the White Mountains in the summer . Who took the picture ? My mom . I remember she was laughing . Did you have a good relationship with her ? I miss her very much . Ah-ah . Ah . Let 's go back to the picture . And tell me what else happened that day . - We begged her ... - Take your time . It 's almost over . My brothers and I , we begged her to keep it . We wore her down . She said yes . We named him Fred . How did that make you feel ? Happy . Let me tell you about them . They 're horrid creatures . Vile . Part organic tissue , part machine . Just like everything from over there . They 're loathsome . Hateful . - Contemptible . - Contemptible ? Is he doing the synonym thing again ? Uh , he was telling me about the shapeshifters . Now he 's moved on to the other universe in general . Immoral . Evil . Walter , we have been over this . What is in the past is in the past . We have agreed to move forward . Even I don 't have drugs strong enough to forget they kidnapped Olivia to the Other Side . - They did ? - For weeks , that awful woman pranced around my lab . - Awful woman ? - Uh , the other Olivia . - The one from over there . - Oh . She bought my ignorance with baked goods while she carried out her plan to steal pieces of the machine . With that damned Portuguese sweet bread . - The machine that created the bridge ? - Yes . But that was not their intent . What they expected was for our world to be destroyed . Annihilated . Walter , it did not happen . That doesn 't mean that I have to like them . There 's another mirror in the back storage cabinet . Kennedy , help me . Lincoln . - Thank you . - No problem . Quickly . - Morning . - Hi . What 's with the redecoration ? Walter . Hey , don 't look at me like I have some reasonable explanation . It 's Walter . - Is Lincoln here already ? - Mm-hm . You did tell him he could come by to learn about shapeshifters , right ? - But I didn 't think he would beat me in . - Well , he just lost his partner . Plus , he is new in town . He doesn 't know anybody . He 's probably a little lonely . No . - Not going to happen . - Why not ? He 's cute . If I went out with him , I 'd start having second thoughts , like I always do . And then he would get hurt and my workplace would become awkward . You know what ? He 's not even my type . Do you ever think that maybe your type just doesn 't exist ? Dunham . I 'll be right there . Twenty-three victims we know of . All following the same MO . He drills in the back of the skull to access the brain . The tissue was punctured and exposed to localized electrical charges but that 's not what killed them . The official cause of death , cerebral hypothermia . A chemical agent was used to lower the brain 's temperature . They froze from the inside out . Twenty-three murders . Why haven 't I heard of them ? Because these crimes weren 't committed over here . We 've been asked to assist on this case . Is that gonna be a problem ? Initiate scan . Scan complete . Twenty-two murders . Killer didn 't leave a single clue . Then , on the 23rd , we found a stray hair . DNA led us to John Louis McClennan . No prior arrests . His show-me is up-to-date . Once we ID 'd him , we went to his house , ready to apprehend him but he didn 't show up . He 's disappeared . - He was ahead of you . - With a 220 IQ , I imagine way ahead . Five years we 've been looking for this guy . He was sloppy once . He 's not gonna make the same mistake . So , what do you need from us ? We need you to escort the John Louis McClennan from your side over to ours . Why ? To what end ? We 're hoping that he can give some insight into our Mr. McClennan . - I understand they have ... - I know all the reasons not to do this . I 've been through them with my own Colonel Broyles . Frankly , we got no options . Okay , well , why don 't you just interview him over here ? We want him to see where the killer was living . If he can , uh , interact with the space , study his belongings he can glean something that we can 't . - You hope he can . - Well , I lived in your apartment and I picked up a lot of things about you . Will you excuse us a moment ? Okay , I get it , the accord was necessary , but this is different . - Stop . - Saving people 's lives is important but , I mean , have we even thought this through ? - How can we both ... ? - It 's really not that complicated . Chain of command is simple . Over here , we 're in charge . Over there , they are . It is only simple if there 's trust . What about that tech we gave them that we took from the shapeshifter ? Have we heard back ? Their Science Division is still working on it . I haven 't forgotten about that . Look , I know this is difficult for you . If there was any other way to execute this , I 'd ask someone else . How is this even gonna work ? Are we prepared to start telling civilians about the parallel universe ? No . Professor McClennan won 't have to know where he 's being taken . He 's a professor ? And over there he 's a serial killer ? And we 're counting on similarities ? On our side McClennan teaches forensic psychology at Western Connecticut College . His area of study , serial killers . Look , I don 't know if this is gonna work but maybe it 's not so far-fetched , either . Uh , I 'm surprised . You read my article . I 'm working on a follow-up , actually . I don 't think that we can underestimate the role that empathy plays in the structuring of the self , or the lack thereof . I 've profiled before for law enforcement but I should say that this is the first time with the FBI . Are you willing to participate ? Agent Dunham , I 've been working towards this my entire life . There 's a reason that we 've kept this out of the media . - This case is highly classified . - Okay . One of the things that you are not able to know is where we 're going . Do you have any allergies to tranquilizers ? What happened to blindfolds ? It 's a long journey . I assure you , it 'd be more comfortable this way . No . No allergies . Come in . This is Agent Bergmann . He 'll be administering a mild sedative . Ooh . Here 's to intrigue . Okay , thanks . - Are we wired ? - Good to go . - Hey , Liv , it 's me . - Yeah , come in . - What do you think ? - Blond looks good on you . Yeah , well , lucky Frank likes the red , huh ? I didn 't say I didn 't like the red . - You look good in both . - Thank you . - They 're pulling up . - Okay . Thank you . Agent Dunham . We appreciate your help on this . Hello , Agent Lee . I button my jacket . So where do you want me ? We 've got audio surveillance in that vehicle . We 'll monitor from there . Okay , that 's fine . Showtime . I 'm not afraid . I 'm not afraid . Ready to do this ? Gotta gas it . Yeah , yeah . - Can I do the windows ? - I would love it if you would . Well done , my girl . That is beautiful work . Want a snack ? Walter . Walter ! Do you have any idea how loud that was ? - A man may soothe his soul . - You found that soothing ? Do you have any idea what it cost Mozart to create that movement ? Stop . What 's wrong with you ? Nothing . My nerves are a bit raw . I haven 't been sleeping well . I checked your meds and the counts are way off . - You 've been overdoing it . - I 've been experimenting again . It 's okay . I 'm gonna help you get back on track . But if there is something else going on , you need to tell me . I need to rest , that 's all . Perhaps I 'll go lie down . He needs to feel in control . Messy spaces bother him . He 's highly intelligent . He 's probably self-taught . He 's fascinated by the brain . " Germany . China . Uh , Thailand . " Yeah , he ordered a lot of parts online from overseas for the schematics that he designed . What are these for ? We don 't know . He needs to divert himself from his misery so he builds things to occupy his time . You hate being out here , don 't you ? Why do you say that ? Because it would drive her crazy . I 'm fine with it . Egg-hatching lights . My dad used to work on a farm . We had chickens for a while . I don 't know what he 'd be using this for . Does anything else stand out to you ? Mm . Uh ... Uh , he 's deeply unhappy . He grew up feeling deprived . Other kids had things and he didn 't . He 's trying to make up for it now but he can 't . Dinner 's important to him . He hunts during the day . He blends into his surroundings . I have to go to the bathroom . - Okay . Come straight back . All right ? - I will . Don 't touch anything you don 't have to . - I 'll just finish your job for you here . - Okay . There 's one across the street . - What ? - The chair . Uh , we had a set of chairs like that in the house that I grew up in . That 's crazy . It 's exactly the same . - I loved that chair . Ha , ha . - Well ... Huh . - Oh , my . - What do you think ? There 's too many of them . They 're strangers to him . Uh , he doesn 't know them . Why have them displayed ? Because he 's jealous of them . Because he ... He hates that they have happy lives . That 's what he looks for . He takes them when they 're happy . His feelings are all that matter . He wants to feel better . Mom ? Mom ? How can he have this ? Do you know that man ? He 's my father . What is this ? What ... ? Is this some kind of a joke ? No , John , this is not a joke . Of course not . What the hell is going on here ? Why do you have a picture of my father ? And the same chair from my childhood ? - It 's over . - Don 't . He 's my responsibility . - Professor . Professor , wait . - I 'm finished here . Where am I ? Where am I ? - I should have removed the pictures . - You took a calculated risk . I thought it would work too . Broyles didn 't want me to do it , and Charlie thinks I 'm insane . Charlie is on a beach with the bug lady . - I 'm sorry . Mrs. Bug-Lady . - Okay . Besides , it 's not over yet . - I 'm gonna go in there . - Give her a minute . Don 't . In this universe , some things are the same and some things aren 't . People make different choices and therefore end up in different places . This is like a nightmare . John , anything that you can tell us about him ? Anything will help . I don 't just understand him I am him . What 's in him is in me . What do you mean ? You 're not the only one with secrets . Go on . For as long as I can remember I knew something was wrong with me . My father , he knew it too . He saw the darkness . He used a heavy hand to try and fix me . The brutality of it , it was ... I also came from an abusive home . My stepfather . It 's no mistake that I do what I do . I want to understand myself . I want to help people like me . Have you ever acted on it ? No . But I 've wanted to . What stopped you ? Not what , who . She ... She helped me find just small moments of peace . Moments that I can hold on to . - Your mother ? - No . My mother would ... Her name was Margery . And what my father did with cruelty , she did with love . She taught me that I didn 't have to live in the darkness . That when I got the urges I could just step out of it , into the light . This ... This is crazy , this ... This is ... Because sometimes when I imagine what my life would 've been like without her this is it . Can I see you ? I wish I could tell him . Tell him what ? That it doesn 't have to be this way . That there 's a way . He just had no one to teach him . I mean , you said so yourself . Some things happened some way in this world and some didn 't , right ? That may be so . But , John he can never know that you exist . You understand that ? - There 's no other road for him . - Right . Her name is Noreen Miller , 32 . Okay . So when did this happen ? She disappeared from a gas-station rest stop about an hour ago . The security cameras picked up an image of him before she disappeared . There 's another victim ? John thinks he may be able to help you find him . Let 's go get him . - Where is he ? - Bathroom . It 's gone . - What 's gone ? - Photograph of his father . I take full responsibility . I 'm the senior officer . - Lincoln 's just trying to protect me . - I 'm not interested in culpability now . - Do we have any leads ? - We think we know where he 's going . You don 't sound entirely convinced . We think that he 's trying to find the killer . And why would he do that ? Because we believe he wants to stop him . We 're online . Professor John McClennan is not from here . The differences between his universe and ours will take him time to comprehend , making it easier to track him . He doesn 't have a show-me which means his access to public transportation is restricted . There 's a 43.2 percent chance that , under extraordinary circumstances he 'd be willing to steal someone 's identification . I 'd say this is pretty extraordinary . Initial calculations indicate that there are 219 potential routes he could have taken in the time he 's been missing . But the possibilities branch out exponentially the longer he 's out there . Even with our facial-recognition programs going through that much data is going to take time . How long ? Thirteen hours , plus or minus . If you 're right , Agent Dunham , then finding Professor McClennan is our best chance to save Noreen Miller . - Let me know when you have something . - Yes , sir . I have an idea . That woman processes more information in an hour than we will in a lifetime . So if she hasn 't thought of it , it 's not there . She didn 't see the photograph of John 's father , and I did . John said his father worked as a farm hand . - Lf we can trace the farm ... - But we can 't . Johns ' father didn 't own the farm . His name wouldn 't be on it . In the photograph , he was standing in front of a tractor with commercial plates . Pennsylvania TR53H79 . We can trace the registration . Weir Farm . Shut down 10 years ago after the Richboro fires . It 's been unoccupied ever since . Noreen Miller . Goes without saying , but I 'm still gonna say it : All necessary steps should be taken to bring her home unharmed . Any questions ? Let 's go . Ride with me . It doesn 't have to be like this . You don 't have to hurt her . You 're going for the.45 , silver . You keep it in the toolbox . How did you know that ? How did you know that ? That 's where he kept it . My dad . What are you ? I was like you . And then one night in October , I went to a fair . I was 10 . And that 's the night that my father found the dead things . Only I didn 't know that yet . I was playing carnival games . And I saw him coming toward me . And I knew that he knew . - The moment I saw him , I knew ... - That 's my life . That 's what happened to me . It was the ring toss that I was playing . Yeah . Me too . - I hid . - Behind the wagon wheel . But he found me . Grabbed me by the collar , his fingernails cut into my neck . He dragged me home and beat me for three days straight . Not me . I ran . As far , as fast , as long as I could . I woke up in a field . And this woman was standing over me . Her name was Margery . And because of her I don 't have to do what you do to stop the pain . - You can 't control it if you 're like me . - I can control it . - She taught me how . No . - This is the only way . - I do this , and for a while it 's quiet . - I can stop the urges . No . I know the screams inside your head that won 't stop . It 's a horrible place to be . But I can help you . Like Margery helped me . You can step out of the darkness . Don 't you want the pain to end ? - Yes . - I can show you how . Maybe you can . What you said to John about your stepfather , you were trying to open him up . Yes . It 's also true . - So , what happened to him ? - My stepfather ? I killed him . We are ready to begin . Tell me about your happiest memories . Tell me about Margery . Inside . Downstairs . It 's clear . - Damn it . - We 're in the wrong place . You all go down to the sheds . We 're not quite clear . Hold on . What are you thinking ? Over there . There was a structure here . It could be anything . A shed , a barn . There 's another one . There was a group of structures here . This is where the family lived . How did Margery make you feel ? Safe . She was so kind . So gentle . I never understood how someone so beautiful could love something so dark . Don 't have to do it anymore . She 's sedated but her pulse is strong . Put your hands where I can see them . I wanted what he had , what she gave him . - John , put your hands up . - I took her from him . I shouldn 't have . She made him feel for them . What have I done to all of them ? Margery , what have I done ? How 's the professor ? There appears to be no permanent damage to his motor functions or cognitive ability . He is , however , suffering from partial memory loss . Partial ? He 's unable to recall the events of the last few weeks . He has no memory of ever being involved in this case . What about Margery ? His memories of Margery were extracted . The neurologists believe the loss is permanent . For all we know , she 's the only thing preventing him ... I know . Once he 's released , we 'll have to keep an eye on him . Can I talk to him ? He 's been told he was injured doing profiling work for the FBI . Okay . Hi . Do you remember me ? Nothing at all ? I 'm Olivia Dunham . I 'm one of the FBI agents who was working on the case . They tell me I saved a woman 's life . Yes . And probably many more . I came to say thank you . I was glad I could be of help . Do you remember Margery ? The other agent asked that too . No . But things are pretty dark right now . Did she have something to do with the investigation ? Sort of . Feel better soon . You know what they say : That even when it 's the darkest , you can step into the light . He knows what she taught him , but he can 't remember who she is . How is that possible ? At the risk of sounding sentimental ? I 've always thought there are people who leave an indelible mark on your soul . An imprint that can never be erased . Walter . I 'm here . Who are you ? Can you hear me ? I 'm right here . No . Walter , I 'm right here . No , you 're not . I 'm here , Walter . You ... You 're just a figment of ... Walter , I 'm right here . I 'm right here , Walter . I 'm right here . Walter , I 'm here . Can you hear me ? I 'm right here . Walter . Help me , Walter . Please , help me .

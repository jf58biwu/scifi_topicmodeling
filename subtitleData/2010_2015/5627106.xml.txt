 The survival of Oswald Danes turns out to be the first incident in a much bigger story . The amazing thing about the miracle is not that no-one 's dying , it 's not that the human race has become immortal , it 's that it happened to everyone at the same time . So now what we have accumulating are people who should be dead but aren 't . We have to start manufacturing painkillers immediately . Jilly Kitzinger , Mr. Danes . - I 'm something of a talent spotter . - I don 't need you . I disagree , Mr. Danes . Someone 's trying to erase Torchwood . What if they 're also trying to erase anyone who 's ever had any contact with Torchwood ? Go get him . I have a car . REX : All right , just drive . Drive , drive . What the hell is going on ? Welcome to Torchwood . What happened to you in there ? Something happened to all of us , not just me . Miracle Day arrived , and ... we all came out of it changed . But why do you think people accept you as an expert ? I-I 'm no expert , but ... I 'm a free man . And since the miracle , the White House has said nothing , scientists have said nothing . I think the establishment is scared into silence . I survived . I can say what I want . Such as ? Well , is anyone paying attention to the profits that the drug companies are making ? We need drugs more than ever . But I think we should take all those pills and those tablets and those potions , and give them to people free . Yes , that 's what I 'm saying , because that 's how radical the world needs to be right now . Free drugs , free healthcare , free access for all . INTERVIEWER : You really think that is practical ? DANES : Who 's to say what 's practical any more ? That 's pre-miracle thinking . - Who told you to set me up ? - Rex ! - P-Put the gun down . - Because everywhere I turn , the whole CIA has been poisoned against me , by you ! Who told you to do it ? ! - I don 't know what you mean . - Bullshit ! You set me up , Friedkin , and you got paid to do it . Now , technically , we both know that I can 't " kill " you . But you see , the beauty of this miracle is , if I shoot you just right , then maybe you might live in agony for ... who knows how long ? Maybe 1,000 years ? Now , you think about that , because I 've always wondered what part of the brain is memories ... or personality ... or what lets you control your own bladder ? - No , don 't ! - Tell me ! I-I-I don 't know who they are . I never did . They just paid me over the years . They 've been there for decades , and I can 't ... couldn 't stop them . I mean , it 's too late . Look , they 've ... they 've only ever contacted me on one telephone number . - Get the number . - Yes , I know that . Thanks . Yeah , well , hurry up . I was right about the alarm . The police are on their way . - Esther 's tracking them . - Er ... confirmed . There 's a unit on 5th - heading for Riverdale . - North or south ? North . I mean , heading from the north going south . Gwen , one car from the north . On it . Doing it . They only contact me . They call me through that . But listen , Rex , you won 't find them . I never did . They 're everywhere . They know everything . Well , I just have one more thing to say . - Don 't go deaf . - What ? [ GUNSHOT ] [ RINGING ] You took your time . [ SIREN WAILS ] One unit on Tacoma . Jack , you 'd better move . They 're right on top of you . [ SIREN WAILS ] Go , go , go , go , GO ! Not bad , team . - Not bad at all . - What did we get ? We got a cellphone . So , whoever made the miracle , now we 've got contact . Anything ? Any news ? JACK : Yeah . Don 't worry , it 's good . They 've moved Rhys and Anwen to a safe house , location unknown , but they 're in the custody of Sergeant Andy Davidson . We 've got his number . Have you called him ? That line 's been decommissioned . - I 'm trying , OK ? - OK , that 's my bloody family , so hurry ! Right , here we go . Brand-new mobiles for everyone , courtesy of Jack 's cashpoint card . I hope I didn 't clear you out . Not a chance . That account 's been gathering interest since 1906 . And some new clothes , just some basics . If they don 't fit , then tough . Jack . And food . Everybody is panic buying , so I had to go to the petrol station , and all they had was crisps . Oh , I think you meant gas station and chips . Crisps are called chips over here . Thank you , Miss Translation . Oh , and a mobile is a cellphone , and by cashpoint , I think you mean ATM . Don 't ever leave my side , OK ? It is absolutely mental out there . Some TV show said the miracle was a virus , then some website said it was the plague , so they all run to the shops and clear the shelves . Oh , and the new cult out on the street , that march ... they call themselves ... the Soulless . Apparently , everlasting life has robbed mankind of their souls . Oh , it turns out Friedkin was telling the truth . His handset was only contacted by one number . - I traced it , but it hits a vine . - What 's a vine ? A vine is when you trace a number back , but the trail branches out , then it branches out again and again . Piggyback those secondary numbers spreading out almost exponentially . So , instead of tracing one number , you 're chasing 500,000 . What ? - You should be in the hospital . - Hey , less of the sympathy . He can keep working , the bastard ! You 're gonna keep just going on and on about your kid , huh ? Do you want her here with us ? Hmm ? Maybe she can go play in that corner , where the lead paint chips look extra tasty . Got you that from your mates , the Soulless . - Did you get me painkillers ? - Sold out . Unlucky . But I think we should take all those pills and those tablets and those potions , and give them to people free . See ? Now , this guy has got a good idea - free drugs . - So , who is this guy ... Oswald Danes ? - Ah , he just got lucky . He 's a convicted murderer and pedophile sentenced to death on Miracle Day . All the same , he 's on every channel . We need to investigate anyone who 's making a profit out of this . - On it , doing it . - So go back , search family history , - everything ... - I know . Thank you , I know what I 'm doing . And this lemonade is flat . It 's lemonade . It 's supposed to be flat . - What , fizzy , fizzy lemonade ? ! - It 's fizzy in the UK and flat in the US . - Hmm , just about sums it up . - How are we doing on the money ? I can 't trace where the bribes came from , but I 'm going through Friedkin 's patterns of behavior instead . He 's a section chief . You 're not getting into those files . Hm , really ? You want to bet ? This Torchwood software , it 's serious . - What are you doing with that ? - Nothing.just putting my numbers in . - Whose numbers ? - My sister 's . You 're going to phone your sister ? - No ... - Esther , what the hell is the matter with you ? Don 't you know how serious this is ? The CIA is gonna be monitoring - her calls . - I 'm sorry , OK ? - Well , think next time ! - Come on , Rex . She 's not used to this . Well , I 'm not used to this either . It doesn 't make me stupid . - That 's enough , OK ? - And who the hell put you in charge ? I think the CIA did . You 're a member of Torchwood now , whether you like it or not . I 'm sorry , OK ? I really am . I just ... I 've never done all this before , and you guys have . I sit at my desk and read blogs for a living . Rex , it 's my sister . She 's just ... She 's not well . Yeah , it 's irrelevant . I tried to do a search on morphic fields , 'cause that 's the best that I could work out , that some sort of morphic field suspended the human race . - But ... oh , it 's got to be more than that . - What do you mean ? It 's like there 's some sort of energy behind this , a will , a drive , a consciousness , 'cause this miracle , it 's more than people just surviving . They are so alive . You saw Lyn , that woman at the airport . She should have been paralyzed , but she just kept on going . And I 've seen bodies at the morgue burnt and broken , still alive , staring right at me . They weren 't even allowed to be unconscious . It 's as if something is willing them to go on , each and every individual , forced into life . That was me ... all the way through my accident ... wide awake . And you could feel everything that happened ? It still hurt ? Yeah . So what did the search say ? Well , that 's the problem . Everybody 's had the same idea . " Morphic field " ... gets 10 million results . Then I 'll go through them , all 10 million . See , that 's what I do when I 'm at my desk . Hard work . I know . - He cock-blocked the ATF . - I have no idea what any of that means . The ATF is the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives . They asked the CIA about information on a warehouse here in Washington , but Friedkin forwarded the request on to ancillary three times . GWEN : What 's ancillary ? It 's a paper chase , a guaranteed way to lose something in the system . So , if he tried to stop people from seeing the warehouse , then maybe he was paid to protect it , which would indicate there 's something in there . - It 's at 3rd and Boston , south-west . - All right , so we 've got a mission . First thing we need to do is steal a new car . Er ... ahem ! So who 's giving the orders ? OK , Torchwood , what do you say ? We need to steal a new car . [ GLASS SMASHES ] - [ ALARM BLARES ] - Got one ! REX : Oh , there 's somebody 's dry-cleaning back here . [ LAUGHS ] And it 's my size . I 'm taking these . My clothes are stinking . Ladies , avert your eyes . That includes you , World War II . These new phones aren 't bad . The camera is good quality , too . I know you didn 't just take a picture of me changing my pants . - You 're changing your pants ? - Pants mean trousers . Are we really on a mission here ? Yeah , well , maybe this is the way Torchwood does things , mate . Yeah , well , maybe you want to drive on the other side of the street , " mate " . Mmm . ESTHER : 3rd and Boston . That 's the one . Security profile says the guard 's on a quarterly rotation . That means he checks in with base every 15 minutes starting on the hour . All right , so we gonna come up with a plan , or is that just the American thing to do ? [ HORN BEEPS ] - Hi . - What can I do for you ? - Er , I wonder , can you help ? - Sure . We 're a little bit lost . Sorry . The British abroad - hopeless , honestly ! But I think ... We 're trying to get to Boston Avenue . Is it Boston ... Boston Road or Boston ... ? Is it Boston Street ? Oh ! - You 've done that before . - So many times . - Esther , how much time do we have ? - 77 minutes . I can unlock it , but only by tricking it into thinking it 's booting up for the day , but that means all the lights will come on , the computers will boot up . REX : Do it . - Esther , keep watch . - Right . Let 's see what 's in this . Let me see that . It 's drugs . - [ LAUGHS ] It 's legitimate drugs . - What is it ? Metanec . Metanec is a painkiller , yeah ? [ CHUCKLES ] Hallelujah ! - Thousands of them . Millions of them . - PhiCorp . Yeah , you know PhiCorp , Jack - PhiCorp 's a big pharmaceutical company . We 've got PhiCorp back home . It 's everywhere , it 's worldwide . These are the same pills I 've been taking . The beauty of it is they 're non-narcotic . They keep you painless and wide awake . It 's the perfect drug for the new world order . There was a delivery yesterday . When was the first one ? Way back . Oh . Oh , hold on . Deliveries go back at least a year , all for drugs . All from PhiCorp . Oh , my God ! JACK : Bigger on the inside than the outside . GWEN : These are all painkillers ? - They 're ready for a war . - No . They were ready for the miracle . PhiCorp knew it was coming . You , come here . This woman 's husband strangled her . She doesn 't die , so he keeps strangling her . Now her brain is soup , her hyoid bone - her neck - is like dust , and you 're telling me - that 's not murder ? - We 've charged him with assault . Well , that 's not enough ! This is what murder looks like now ! Don 't blame me . We 're not even allowed to say " attempted murder " any more , 'cause murder 's impossible . The whole system 's breaking down . It 's the NIH . They say you 're late for some kind of panel . MAN : I 'm looking at an additional half million people a day . What 's up ? The 50 % of pregnancies that spontaneously abort are not aborting . - Genetic mistakes are suddenly viable . - No baby is a mistake . - Oh ! - What hospital are you from ? - Providence . Dr. Carey Murphy . - Yeah , I was a Catholic too , once . I got better . We 're talking brain outside the skull , no skin , no face , suffering . - Yeah , these are mistakes . - [ CLATTERING ] Oh , hell . Sorry . Um , but actually , I think we can help . Jilly Kitzinger . Hi . Pain management in newborns is something we 've already got going on at PhiCorp , - so we can roll out a strategy . - Fine . We 've got a bigger problem . Somebody got off a plane from New Delhi in Boston last night , and now we 've got cholera . I warned you ! I seem to recall no shortage of clean water in Boston . Turn on a tap , gentlemen . Can we talk about the situation in the ERs ? And I 'm going to keep warning you - we 'll see more of this every day . DR. ROSENBLOOM : We 're not done with the birth issue , guys . They 're putting contraceptives in the water supply in India , mainland China . That 's something we might have to look at here . That 's not a serious proposition ? It doesn 't matter what happens in the long term if we lose our healthcare system now . We need more facilities , more space , but who 's gonna organize it ? DR. ROSENBLOOM : We 'll put it on the agenda , but I think we 're getting pretty far off track here . Can we talk about the contraception option with some professional distance , please ? It 's been raining on and off . Oh ! Like it wasn 't end-of-the-worldly enough . [ SIGHS ] We don 't deserve this miracle . We 're just gonna screw it up , like we always do . Human damn beings . And I 'm including myself . PhiCorp needs feedback from medical staff . Why don 't you come and talk to us ? - My schedule is a little full . - OK . That 's fine . But you gave a commencement speech last year at Columbia about your college mentor , how she worked for Doctors Without Borders when they were just starting out in Biafra . You said you wanted to find a way to give back , like she did . Did you find that ? I ... I was talking about fieldwork . Everything 's fieldwork now . I mean , FEMA ... FEMA is ... hopeless . It 's a pot of glue that still thinks it 's a racehorse . PhiCorp can really do something . You 're just out to make a profit . Well , companies profit by turning situations around to their advantage . But isn 't that how every human damn being gets through their day ? Come in and say hello . Just once . - Maybe . - I 'll take that as a yes ! Oh , God . I gotta go . Busy , busy . But you have my card and you won 't regret it . And that 's a promise . OK , we do a deep search on this PhiCorp . I wanna peel back security and find everything . - I can handle company history . - I can do European operations . Whoa , whoa , whoa , wait a minute . After we do all this research , then what do we do ? We go in , whether that means infiltration or confrontation . So , we 're just gonna sit on this information ? Come on , guys , seriously ? I mean , we 've got a major link between an international corporation and the miracle , and we 're just gonna keep it to ourselves ? We got this far on our own . Yeah , but see , it 's not just about us . Not any more . This is about doing the right thing ... - for the state and for the people . - Jack , he 's got a point . OK . We need a friend with connections . Got any ideas ? REX : All right . My senior instructor at Langley . I 'm pretty sure he 'd still give me a chance . - He 's CIA . - He 's ex-CIA . Look , I know this is a risk . I know that . But it 's a risk I 'm willing to take . So what do you say ? OK . OK . And I 've got proof . I 've got photographs and documentation . But I can 't compromise you or your family , sir . You know I would never do that . So maybe we could meet somewhere neutral . How about the lobby of the Freeville Hotel ? It 's on North Street West . The Freeville Hotel . [ SIRENS WHOOP , TIRES SCREECH ] Damn . REX : What 's the use ? We discover this PhiCorp shit , but everyone 's been turned against us . We 're still on the run . We can 't trust anyone . But they can 't have got to everyone we know and they can 't be tracking the cellphones , ' cause they 're new . I warned you . Whoever these people are , they 're good and they 're ready for us , which puts us back at square one . We tackle PhiCorp ourselves . [ CHUCKLES MIRTHLESSLY ] And is that standard Torchwood policy ? Suppose it is , yeah . You know , you ... you dress like it 's World War II , so I don 't expect you to be up on current events , but there is no Torchwood ! It 's dead . Gone . Buried . It 's us ! As far as I can see , you got all your staff killed . They were my friends . - Your dead friends ! - ESTHER : Rex , don 't . " Rex , don 't " ! Ah , you want me to stop ? I 'll stop . Who the hell are you people anyway ? Rex , hold on . Hold on . We 've got to work together on this , Rex . Don 't , Rex . Don 't ! Don 't ! Rex ! [ FAST ROCK MUSIC PLAYS ] [ SIREN WAILS ] City 's going wild . Everyone 's out drinking . Nobody knows whether it 's a party - or a wake . - JACK : My arm is itching . Poor baby . - I think it 's infected . - You 're worse than Rhys . It 's itching because it 's healing . Now , stop it , Jack . 05 , Jack ! Mortal man ... mortal needs . Yeah , we 've got work to do . I am so mortal . Hey , baby ! What 's up ? Yeah ! Whoo ! There 's a poem . " I have been one acquainted with the night . " I have walked out in rain and back in rain . " It 's probably not about walking . I suppose it 's about death . Yeah . The poets are the ones who are really gonna suffer , aren 't they ? All those poems about death . [ CHUCKLES ] Well , it was Robert Frost , so maybe it really was just about walking . Oh ... My apartment 's that way . Ten minutes down the freeway , turn off at 11th . - Home . - You 'd be arrested on the spot . And that 'd be worse than this ? I 'd be safe , be warm . Wouldn 't be holding you back . I don 't know if I can do this . What 's wrong with your sister ? She 's not sick . She just ... can 't cope . Never could . I 'm the youngest , but I 've always ... looked after her . Well ... she 's in that direction . But I 'm warning you , you give up now and you 'll prove that Rex was right . Can 't have that . No , we can 't . - " Miles to go before we sleep . " - Mm-hm . [ POUNDING BEAT ] Scotch . What are these ? Sobriety chips . Got two-month chips , six-month chips . I think I 've got a whole bowl of ten-year chips around here somewhere . People are throwing a lot of sober out the window tonight . Sorry I can 't add to your collection . Unless you want a button . Oh , you damage that coat , I 'm jumping over this bar to protect it . Jack . You like the coat ? Brad . Passionately . What 's the latest from the White House , Candice ? Are we getting any sort of clarity ? Well , off the record George , this miracle is so impossible , a lot of high-level officials are thinking the word " alien " meaning an intervention or at least an influence from beyond this world . But so far still , no-one is willing to say it out loud . Well , bringing the discussion back down from outer space , we saw some action today . The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case asking for adjustments to the life sentences of convicted criminals , because these days , how long is life ? CANDICE : Right ; the argument is that a life sentence is now potentially infinite . Tomorrow we 've got Oswald Danes in Our Atlanta studio ... [ SWITCHES TV OFF ] - It 's OK ? - Mm-hm . For the trumpet shall sound , and the dead shall be raised incorruptible , and we shall be changed . For this corruptible body must put on incorruption , and this mortal shall put on immortality . So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption , and the mortal shall have put on immortality , then shall he brought to pass the saying which is written " Death shall be swallowed up in victory . " O death , where is thy sting ? 0 grave , where is thy victory ? " REX : Dr. Juarez . [ REX GROANS ] I 'm gonna need you to dress this again . And I 'm afraid I 'm gonna have to insist . [ LABORED BREATHING ] I 'm gonna need your help . You know , medicine and care ... just until I clear my name . I 'm just taking your word for it that you 're not a traitor . [ REX CHUCKLES ] Oh , yeah . But you know , you 've already given me drugs , taken me into your home . You know , we both have the power to make a case against one another . - Nice . - Yeah . So , what you 're saying is , that 's what our relationship comes down to - blackmail . Huh ! Well ... [ GROANS SOFTLY ] When you put it that way ... it 's kinda hot . Rex ... I 'm exhausted . Me too . Do you have protection ? What for ? Can 't die now . Don 't need nothing in-between . That 's not how it works any more . A lifetime of regret just got even longer , that 's all . Fine . You 're calling the shots . Yes . Yes , I am . - Ouch ! - Oh , are you OK ? Yeah , I 'm OK . Come on . The sting of death is sin , and the sake of sin is the law ! But thanks be to Goal which giveth us our victory through our Lord Jesus Christ . Hey ... HEY ! - I was just leaving . Just leaving . - Carla , this the guy ? CARLA : It 's him . No , you got me mistaken with somebody else . Oswald Danes , the child killer . - No . - If you don 't want to be recognized , don 't put your face on TV ! Let 's get him . Officer ! That kid ! He 's ... he 's harassing me . Oh , not fair , man . You know who you got there ? - Look at him . - It 's a mistake . - You should go home , sir . - That 's Oswald Danes . Do you know what he said about the girl , the one he killed ? " She should have run faster . " That 's what he said . Go home right now . Thank you . Thank you very much . I 'm ... just trying to get back to my motel . Do you think you could give me a lift ? It 's just off 278 . Yeah , get in . Thank you . DANES : What ? Is there a problem here ? Officer ? You can get out , sir . Ah , shit . All right . Of course . Of course . Here we go , huh ? [ CHUCKLES ] Here we go . Don 't you worry , sir . Nothing on your face . You 'll still be nice and handsome for the TV . You should have run faster , Oswald . Are you saying the pharmaceutical companies knew it was gonna happen ? Only one company - PhiCorp . You OK ? My ... my mother had a massive stroke last year . I ... I had to make a choice . God , if I 'd just kept her alive a little longer , if I 'd been warned ... They even gave me their card . PhiCorp . Some woman called ... Kitzinger . She wants me to go to some kind of private meeting . Well , you know you have to go and find out more . I need to know what they 're doing . - Rex , that 's your job , not mine . - What ? Hey , listen , I 'm serious . I need you to do this . You break in here , threaten to expose me for helping you and now you want me to , what , spy for you ? Yeah , will you ? - No ! - PhiCorp knew , Vera . OK ? They could have warned us . Think about your mother . I mean , you let her die . She ... I 'm taking a shower . Let yourself out . And I don 't need to see you again . [ SOFT SNORING ] Gwen , I had to call . I thought of a thing . - Are you drunk ? - A little . You ? Some of us have to work . Your turn to talk . I know . I was thinking ... about how you 're immortal ... and I 'm dying . And what I wanted to say was ... we 're good , aren 't we ? You and me . A good team . I missed you . I was thinking , um ... if this had happened a bit sooner ... - I know . - he 'd ' d still be here , Ianto Dead friends . I 'm sorry . I wish he was here now . Not much of a team , is it ? But we 've still got each other . You and me . Just like the old days . We don 't need anyone , do we ? Sorry . - We don 't need Rex . - I had to bounce a signal off Paraguay , - but it 's to say thanks . - [ BABY CRIES ] Oh , my God . Rhys ? Oh , my God ! Can you see me ? I can see you . Can you see me ? Yes , I can see you . A little bit too much of you , not enough baby . Put up the baby . Give your mum a wave . We don 't need anyone . Right , Gwen ? Gwen ? - Hey ! - Anwen . - Hello , little sweetheart . - It 's your mummy , look ! Your mum ! Hello , darling . We 're safe and we escaped . We 're fine , I promise . I 'll be home as soon as I can . I will . Andy said he can move us with police supervision back to Swansea , so we 're all ready and waiting for you . Hey , it 's your mum ! Hello , Mum ! [ GROANS ] [ FOOTSTEPS APPROACH ] Rough night , Oswald ? Oh , God . What was it ? Was it Jilly or ... ? No , let me guess . Jillian ? Jilly . Jilly Kitzinger . Told you you 'd need me . Now , we have a very important meeting to go to , so you can get cleaned up on the plane to Dulles . Dulles ? Why ? These are the times that make men , Oswald . So , it 's your choice . Stay where you are , or stand up tall and stride across the skin of the world . Which is it ? [ GROANS ] Let 's see ... If that 's a promise of help ... you 'd better deliver ... Miss Jilly Kitzinger . I will , sir . I promise . I 'll hold you to it . Lead on . [ PHONE RINGS ] Yeah ? VERA : You left me your number 'cause you knew I 'd give in . OK , I 'm not the CIA , I don 't go undercover , but .. Maybe I can get you inside . Yes ! I feel awful . Which is amazing ! I thought we broke up . Yeah , well , there 's work to be done . So , they just look like contact lenses , huh ? Mm-hm . Look at the laptop . They 're the one piece of Torchwood tech that I kept . Huh ! It 's like a camera , see ? OK . Side ... - Huh ! - To side . See ? That 's very , very cool . Where 'd you get it from ? A distant moon of a distant star . Ha , ha , ha [ ! ] Really , where 'd you get ' em from ? A distant moon of a distant star . I am loving this hangover . I knew mortality would make life more intense . Ow ! Hey , don 't touch my pills . I need that for legitimate pain . I need them too . - You weren 't impaled . - You should 've seen the other guy ! [ CHUCKLES ] Ooh , that face ! Rex doesn 't like his jokes too gay . No , Rex doesn 't like men in their 40s acting like they 're 20 . And we 've got a winner . Now , hush . Esther 's sending me texts . So we can communicate with the I-5s just by typing . REX : Hm . [ CHUCKLES ] Hello , Esther . I 'm Gwen . Yeah , but there 's no sound . Mm , but we 've got lip-reading software . Look at me . - Right at me . - Mm-hm . Now say something . My name is Rex Matheson , representing the Central Intelligence Agency . COMPUTER : My name is Rex Matheson , resenting the Central Intelligence Ajenny . All right , all right , that 'll work . I can get inside with those . GWEN : Problem . The I-5s , they 're isomorphic ... bio-metrically tuned into me and me alone . Seriously ? Mm-hm . If anyone is going on this mission , it 's got to be me . - Yep . - Huh ? - What ? - [ JACK CHUCKLES ] We very much appreciate your coming . PhiCorp knows how busy you must be . No , I don 't think this is right . I was here to see a Miss Kitzinger ? No , this is the meeting . I think you may know some of these people . Andy Collier from Johns Hopkins . Shelby Lewis , she made the shortlist for the Lasker Prize . OK . We 're starting in five . - Oh , if you 'll excuse me ... ? - First door on your left . Thank you . - Where 's Rex ? - No , I 'm not Rex . I know , hello ! Long story . Go back to the meeting and keep Jilly Kitzinger there for as long as you can . Go ! Are you giving me orders ? YES , go ! - She did good , Dr. Juarez . - Yeah . How 'd you talk her into it ? Well , it 's not exactly a professional relationship . Oswald Danes . - What 's he doing there ? - Tell her to follow Oswald . No , no . No way . Let her stay on the mission . Gwen find out anything about Oswald Danes ? Nothing special , apart from being a monster . He just chose the right day to be executed on . He 's got nothing to do with this stuff . - Ah . - I 'm sorry , no . I have been forgiven . A substantial number of people have forgiven me . I can feel that in my heart in my guts . And forgiveness , it 's like a tide or a storm . It clears the air . I 'm very lucky to have been forgiven and I feel very ... I feel very blessed . And I think of forgiveness as a cure . Gentlemen , Mr. Danes . [ PHONE RINGS ] Yeah ? Who was that woman ? She works for me . Are you at the meeting yet ? Yeah , but it 's not a meeting . It 's some kind of ... presentation . Right . Well , keep the line open . I wanna hear . [ CHATTER ] [ MOUTHS ] Hello , and thank you for coming . I 'm Congressman Patrick Morganthall . Some of you are listening to us from Los Angeles ... A congressman ? In Cleveland , DC , Dallas , Singapore , Hong Kong ... - PhiCorp was ready , worldwide . - If they knew about the miracle , does that mean they caused it ? Our modern drug prescription system has served us very well for many decades , but times have changed . Times have changed a great deal . The need for drugs is far outstripping the access to the people with the means to prescribe them . Something has got to change . And that 's why , later today , I will be introducing legislation to make all prescription drugs , all painkillers , antibiotics , almost all medications , available without a prescription . It 'll , what , multiply sales by tenfold ? Psh ! Try 1,000 . They 're cashing in big time . Where 's Jack ? And I am not just talking about new laws . I am talking about making an entirely new society . Nam this is a massive enterprise , ladies and gentlemen . But it 's up to us . - All of you are experts - Jilly just left . Oh , shit ! Call her ! Call Jilly Kitzinger . [ PHONE RINGS ] - Dr. Juarez , hello . - It 's Vera . I 'm in the screening room . I have some ... Can you come here ? Can I ask you some questions ? Sure ... Sure . Is everything all right ? You ... you sound kind of shaky . - [ LAUGHS ] - Oh ! - Good work , Gwen Cooper ! - [ PHONE VIBRATES ] You gonna get that ? It 's not mine . - They 're calling Friedkin . - Yeah , or they 're calling us . Go , go . Yeah ? Hello ? Who 's there ? Who are you ? Who am I talking to ? Who is this ? [ ESTHER SIGHS ] Nothing . It hits a vine . They could 've traced that handset . Yeah , I know . Come on , we gotta get the hell outta here , outta DC . Pack that stuff up quick . What are you smiling for ? I think we got ' em worried . Let 's go . And let 's find out where the hell Jack went . OK , you ready for me ? Yeah , sure . I 'd apologize for being late , but it wasn 't my fault . I was needed across town . Still ... made it . And ... this will be going out live , yes ? Can you tell me , who 's interviewing me ? Yeah , it 's , uh ... Sod it ! I suppose a man like you was always on his way . You met with PhiCorp today . Why ? You 'll have to ask them . Did they mention the name Jack Harkness ? Have you heard that name ? Never . Why do you ask , Jack ? I figured if you cared that much about the name , it was probably yours . I just want you to talk . What about ? I saw you on television , saying you feel forgiven for taking the life of a child . That 's a lie . I know that 's a lie . How do you know that , Jack , - with such certainty ? - Tell the truth ! The murder of Susie Cabina . - You don 't feel sorry at all . - Oh ... The truth is , she flaunted it . Her innocence . Most people , they get hit or whatever , it 's hours before the bruises rise up , but they showed right away with her . And it was like ... I was painting on her . And she looked so beautiful . I thought it couldn 't get any better than that . But , oh , Jack , I swear to you , right then , at the end , I felt her life leave , and ... and she left through me . Yeah ! You know that feeling ? I think you do . And I relive it every single night , because ... that was the best moment of my life . Now I understand . You 're doing all this 'cause you 're searching for one thing . One simple thing . Execution . World without death , so you get to live . And it 's killing you . Jack , what are you going to do with that recording ? We 're in a broadcast center . Figure I might broadcast it . Excellent idea . If only I didn 't have to do this . Boys ! - Take that recording off him . - Argh ! Ah ! I did visit PhiCorp , and they were kind enough to offer me protection . In exchange for what ? The message . Don 't hurt him . Just ... get rid of him . It 's nice to meet you , Jack Harkness . Well , you can hurt him a little , but not the face . That 's how it 's done these days . Let me be clear ... I 'm not calling for free drugs I 'm calling for free access to drugs . I want every American to have the power to be able to buy whatever they want and need without a prescription . Ah ! If that means that some drug companies are gonna make a profit , then maybe that just ensures that they 'll take better care of us . Argh ! Because government has abandoned us . Argh ! Ah ! And I 'm thinking of companies like PhiCorp . Aargh ! Ah ! Ah ! They 'd never abandon us , because they need us . Aargh ! Ah ! If we 're talking about medications , I have to say that I 'm somewhat of an expert . I spent a lot of long years in solitary confinement ; Dangerous man , companies like PhiCorp tried to help . They put me on a drug regime - with every drug known in the world ... - Did you see him in there ? Did you see Oswald Danes ? - Did you touch him ? - Did I what ? Oswald ! Did you touch him ? They stick with us . And I 'm asking you now to join with me ... In this great enterprise as we all walk across the fragile skin of this wide world ... together . The future is now endless and it 's terrifying . I 'm offering you my hand to walk on this long journey ... together . Walk with me . That 's all I ask . Walk with me . JACK : We need to find somewhere to hide while we plan the assault . Wow ! Look at the horizon ! We 've reached the edge of America . Hey , man . Believe . Let me ask you something . What is this " dead is dead " shit ? - Dead is dead . - Dead is dead . That 's me , huh ? The moment I lose my platform , I get thrown back to the mob . WOMAN : We are surrounded by people who should have died . VERA : There 's just nothing more we could do for them . Segregation is vital and necessary . I have risen with unending life . These living deceased should not have equal rights . You 've compromised the security of the entire mission . - They should be contained ... - I don 't want to live forever . And then they should wait ... Torchwood keeps treating this like it 's a game . Because I believe their passage to the afterlife has but paused - and when this miracle ends ... - I 'm so tired . Death will find them . Their time will come , and they will die .

 Previously on Fringe ... They weren 't all bad . 1 of them tried to help us . He was called September . 5 weeks after the invasion , a man came here . His name was Donald . He was taken away against his will by 2 invaders . We have to find him . Donald showed up at our doorstep . He said the invaders were looking for him . But he needed us to watch over the boy . He said he was part of an important plan to defeat the invaders . Do you remember meeting me with a man named Donald ? The boy is important . He has to live . I know who Donald is . Donald is September . Walter ? I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to startle you . What are you doing up ? I could ask you the same thing . You need your rest , son . There 's work to be done . I 'm freeing our next tape . What 's your excuse ? I believe I have an idea ... about how we can find our friend , September . The memory the boy showed me is in my subconscious . So ... it involves the tank . Okay , Walter , how are- - ? Walter , why did you remove your trunks ? They were too restrictive . My body needs to be as free and open as my mind , so I can find September . Are you feeling sufficiently free and open now ? I am . Let 's get started . Okay , his vitals are steady . His heart rate 's a little low . I think that 's just the sedative kicking in . Oscillation 's coming through clear . Everything seems to be functioning . Walter , you 're good to go . You should be feeling pretty relaxed by now . Hi-his blood pressure 's rising . How much ? It 's 140 / 90 . No , 152 / 100 . It 's still rising . His brain waves are fluctuating . Walter , your vitals are spiking . Are you Okay ? Incredible . I 'm here . Walter ? Where are you ? An apartment . The same one from the flashes the boy showed me . Take a look around . Dou you recognize anything about the space ? Anything that could help us tell where it is ? I 'm with September . And he doesn 't look at all like himself . He has hair . Are there any windows ? Yes . Well , go take a look outside . I see water ... buildings in the distance ... skyscrapers . Uh-uh , New York ? Could be . Yes . Huh . I see the top of the Empire State Building . The Empire State Building 's the east side of Manhattan . To my right ... I can 't quite make- - A bridge . I 'm under a bridge . I think it 's the Williamsburg bridge . Based on the angle of the view that Walter described , I would say that the building is in Brooklyn ... somewhere near the southeast base of where the bridge used to be . So if September 's still alive , and he 's still living in the same place ... that 's where we find ' im . He 's still alive . How do you know ? I 'm optimistic . You are ? Why not ? As to whether September is still living in the same place ... we shall see . We must hurry ! All right ? What ? A child Observer ? We 've never seen one before . What ? A child Observer ? We 've never seen one before . We have received word . He is ready to see you now . Continue searching for the fugitives . Alert me to any developments . * There . It was from over there . Wa- - Hey . Hey , hey , what 's going on with you ? What do you mean ? I feel good . From where I 'm standing , you don 't seem good , you seem amazing , which is a little scary . Wouldn 't worry about me . How can I not ? You asked me to help you stay grounded . You were so afraid of becoming the man that you used to be , you asked Nina to remove pieces of your brain , again . All right , son . The procedure is no longer necessary . But what- - ? Walter . Why ? What 's changed ? I can 't explain it . But ... when the boy touched me ... he showed me more than just images . It was freeing , Peter . All at once , I understood that everything I 've ever known or thought I knew , as ... a great man ... could fit into a thimble . That 's not all he gave me . I remember things ... things I haven 't experienced . I-I think , from the other timeline , before you were erased , before the timeline was reset . I remember when you came to me at St. Claire 's . My first words . " I thought you 'd be fatter . " And I remember the night I was up late , making a peanut butter sandwich ... and you slipped and called me , " Dad . " The feeling of joy that gave me ... and the terror ... before you stepped into the machine . I told you I 've never been good at letting you go , and you said- - " This time , you 're gonna have to . " Hmm . What is this boy ? How could he do this for you ... enable you to see a life you didn 't live ? I 'm not sure ... but I feel it . Do you remember the plan ? No . No idea . But that doesn 't make any sense . Why would he give you back all of those memories , but not give you the plan ? I don 't know . Peter , before I met him ... I didn 't think it was possible to love you more ... but now , knowing what we 've been through ... and everything we 've had ... I do . You never liked public displays of affection . Or going number 2 in a public restroom . I remember that too . The commander awaits . Anomaly XB-6783746 ... has been found . It is being hidden in 2036 . For what purpose ? That is not yet clear . But whoever hid this anomaly ... did so for a reason . It should not exist . But someone wanted it to exist . Someone ensured its survival ... because they thought it was important . This is it . This is the window I was looking out in my vision from the tank ! Here it is . Walter Bishop ! You 're alive . We were trapped in amber . For 21 years , we were frozen in time . I never thought I 'd see you again . G How did you find me ? We 've been relying on the tapes that Walter made in 2015 ... trying to pieces things together . And we found the radio that you left in the pocket universe , and that ... led us to the boy , and he showed me where to find you . The couple that you left him with ... called him Michael . It 's been quite a journey . We 've lost a lot . A lot of good people sacrificed themselves to get us to you . So ... your turn . What happened to you ? Before the invasion , I was apprehended ... for my continued interference in the timeline ... and ... my interaction with all of you . As punishment , they ... removed my device . Now , I 'm no longer able to move through time ... or do the things that I ... was able to do . They experimented on me . They called it " biological reversion . " Now , I am ... no different from you . Truthfully , it wasn 't much of a punishment . I 've always held this era in the highest regard . And why the name Donald ? You really don 't remember , do you ? The first movie we watched together was " Singin ' in the Rain . " And I chose the name ... " Donald O 'Connor . " Yes ! That was an excellent movie . I used to sing " Make ' Em Laugh ... " wonderfully in the key of A minor . I remember . What is he ? He was born hundreds of years from now . Like all of our kind , he was created in a lab ... using the genetic material of ... a designated donor . It was a process that began generations earlier , with a discovery on February 20 , 2167 ... by a scientist in Oslo , Norway , who was trying to find ways to increase human intelligence . He realized that if he could ... rewire the portion of the human brain ... that induces jealousy ... he could increase cognitive function , sacrificing ... emotion for ... intelligence . This discovery ... was the catalyst of the creation of the beings that you ... called " Observers . " And his work carried on ... and more and more emotions were seen as roadblocks to higher intelligence . Things like ... anger , greed , aggression ... they were abandoned ... in the pursuit of intellect . Eventually , humanity became so ... intelligent and efficient , they ... lost perspective of the value ... of these emotions , not ... only the negative ones , but the positive as well ... and soon empathy , compassion , and ... love ... became messy ... distractions ... and they too ... were machined out . And without ... romantic love ... they developed new ... reproductive technologies . I require data on an anomaly . Which progeny is it ? Anomaly XB-6783746 . Early in the boy 's maturation ... the scientists in charge of reproduction , realized that his brain had developed differently ... from other offspring . Its maturation was ... halted . To them , he was an anomaly . A defect . Whose genetic material was used to create this progeny ? I had observed , in your time ... how fathers cared for their sons and ... protected them . It stirred something in me ... that I could not ... ignore . I took the boy away , and hid him in the past ... uh , where he would be safe . He 's your son ? His name was September . He was part of the original 12 science team that traveled back in time to observe primitive humanity . He was banished for sympathizing with the fugitives I am tracking ... the same fugitives ... who are in possession of the anomaly . Why would he go to such lengths ... to protect a genetic defect ? I do not know . I would like a protocol suspension ... to travel back to a moment when I can ... eradicate these resistors . No . We are not prepared to deal ... with a readjustment of probabilities . They disquiet you . The fugitives are inconsequential . He poses minimal risk . We chose this time in history for a reason . A 99.9999 % probability that we will succeed . The boy had a 0.0001 % chance of surviving ... yet he did . Is there something wrong with you ? I am experiencing something that I do not understand . The idea of ending their existence ... consumes me . They are insignificant . So ... no . R So , how does he fit into the plan ? They were right about him . He is an anomaly ... but he 's not ... less than them . He 's more . At first ... I thought his abilities were ... just empathic . But they developed into something greater . I now know that his intellect functions on a level that ... neither you nor we are capable of understanding . But what 's more important ... he has the emotions , the ... compassion , the empathy . A hybrid . Yes . That moment ... that I told you about ... when scientists first decided to sacrifice human emotion ... to increase intelligence ... that was the turning point in human evolution . 20 of February . 2167 . If we can send the boy into the future ... to that moment ... he can demonstrate to those scientists a different kind of intelligence , an enlightenment ... that goes beyond ... knowledge or cognition to something greater . And when they see ... what he is ... when they study him , they will realize all that he is ... living proof that they don 't have to sacrifice emotion ... for intelligence ... and they will never go down that path . And the Observers will never exist . They would never invade . That was the plan we were working on before I ambered us . I always knew the boy was important , but when I realized why ... what he was supposed to do ... my device had been removed . I 'd lost the ability to move through time ... so I came to you . That was the plan . We were going to send the boy ... forward into time . How far have you come with the tapes ? We have the ... rocks from the mine in Pennsylvania ... the magnet ... the Observer beacons , and some scrolls of physics that none of us can decipher . Don 't worry . I can help you with that . These ... things we 've collected ... how they can possibly be used to travel through time ? They are part of a device that we must build . I have the hologram blueprints . It also requires technology that hasn 't been invented , from my time . How do we get it ? I took them from the future long ago . The tech is hidden . It 's not far from here . You Okay ? Peter , I think we 're gonna get our daughter back . Liv- - You heard September ? The plan is gonna reset time . Peter . That boy in there , he 's how we 're going to see Etta again . You don 't believe me ? I want to believe that more than anything . We 've still got a long way to go . After the invasion , September was detained at a mine in Pennsylvania . He was extracting rocks . The purpose of the rocks was not ascertained . What was the outcome ? He was questioned and released . He was labeled " a known offender . " Then he has been tagged . Initiate location protocol . Find his address . Chip number 784651 . Search the apartment . He has mostly likely removed his chip and destroyed it . That is why we could not track it . It is still warm . He was just here . Have the Loyalists review the footage from the surveillance cameras in the area . I want to know where he went . Which one is it ? You and Olivia stay here with Michael . Donald and I will get the tech . They 're in my home . You can 't go back there . There is no " back there . " A Captain Windmark . A traffic camera on Front Street recorded this . We 're putting the description of the vehicle out to all units . The child is with them . That was 14 minutes ago . They cannot have gone far . Set up a perimeter . Here they are . Just as I left them . What ? The boy . He communicated to me when he touched me . What did he show you ? He gave me an awareness of another timeline ... uh , when you ... saved Peter and I from Reiden Lake . When you pulled us from the lake ... you said , " The boy is important . He must live . " You weren 't referring to my son . You were referring to yours . Yes . Did he show you ... anything else ? Yes . There is 1 thing I haven 't told the others . He showed me ... that for the plan to work ... I would have to sacrifice myself . Is that right ? Yes . Are you frightened ? I would be lying ... if I said I wasn 't frightened . Do you think ... that the boy showed me all these other experiences ... because he wanted me to know ... that I have ... loved ... that I have had ... incredible moments ... and connections ? Because ... because it 'll make it easier for me to come to terms with what I have to do ? You think that 's why he did it ? I don 't know . It was your decision ... to sacrifice yourself for the plan . Do you remember that ? No . You said you had caused so much unintended damage ... you felt this was your chance to make amends . You ... would not have it any other way . Do you remember getting a white tulip ? Yes , I do . It was a sign from God . The tulip was important . I took it from the other timeline . And kept it . When we devised the plan ... to stop the invasion ... you didn 't think we could succeed . You ... doubted ... yourself . I knew the tulip ... would give you strength , as it had before . It was your symbol ... of hope ... and absolution . It gave you the courage ... to push on . * At that time , I needed to give you back the hope that we could win . I could use that tulip right now . Where is it ? I don 't know what you did with it . Only you would know that . Is that it ? You say that as though we 're not carrying technology that can bend space and time into a Mobius strip . I 'm not coming with you . I have a few more things ... we 'll need before we get started on the plan . Be careful . You too . I will see you again . I promise . I used to love Brooklyn . We need another route . We came this way less than 30 minutes ago . The checkpoint wasn 't there . Try the alley . Astrid , it 's me . Hey . Did you find Donald ? Yeah , but somebody else found us . They 're setting up roadblocks , and we need to find a way out . Where are you ? We 're parked in an alley at Adams and Tillary . Can you use the resistance network , see if you can hack into any live camera feeds in the area ? Yeah , I 'm accessing it now . Okay , I got it . Just pulling up the feeds . You 're right , they 're setting up a perimeter all around you . There 's no way out . We 're surrounded . C Do you think they found Donald ? Do you think he made it out ? I don 't know , Walter . - Well , we can 't leave him . - We don 't have a choice . He said he 'd contact us . Hey , Astrid , has anything changed ? Are they still holding the perimeter ? Hey , listen , I think I found a hole , but you have to move quick . The monorail 's your best bet . When you cross York , head south . There 's a stop 4 blocks down , near Jay Street . Okay , any activity there ? No , not that I can see . Thanks . Astrid said that we should head toward Jay Street . There 's a monorail station . She said it 's clear . It won 't stay that way for long . Hang here for a sec . They set up another checkpoint , further down . We 're blocked . Okay . I think we should split up . I 'm gonna take Michael with me . A mother and child ... we shouldn 't draw too much suspicion . You 're gonna stay with me , Okay ? Yeah , he 's clear . Go ahead . Hold it right there . Just keep going . You 're doing great . We 're right behind you . Peter . Yeah , I see ' em . No , I see ' em . Just keep moving . Get to the monorail . We 'll be right there . Okay , be careful . Keep moving , please . We 're good . Let 's go . * Hey . The train 's leaving in a few minutes . Where are you ? Not far . - They 're searching cars . - Don 't worry . We 'll meet you at the train . I see you . We 're in the second car . This way , Walter . Go into the first car . On your right . Now . We 're on board . We 'll make our way to you . The-they 're coming to my car . I think they 're gonna search it . Ladies and gentlemen , please have your papers ready for inspection . Michael . Michael ? Michael ! Where 's Michael ? He 's gone . He just walked off the train . What ? Captain . Hello . E

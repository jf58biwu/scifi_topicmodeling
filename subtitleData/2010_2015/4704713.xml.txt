 Ah ! Morning , sir . Ohh ! I just love the hum of the air con first thing in the morning . Don 't you , sir ? Makes you just want to leap out of bed and mop ! - Morning , Krytes . - Oh , something wrong , sir ? Something getting you down ? Is it that you 're the last human being alive with no life , no family , no future , no prospects , no hope , is it ... Is it something to do with that , sir ? Somethin ' to do with that , Kryten , yeah . You 're missing the human race again , aren 't you , sir ? Really missing ' em today , Krytes . I just can 't believe it 's all over . I 've been lookin ' at some old pictures of them , remind me of the old days . Look , there 's a picture of them going to work . Oh . Commuters , mmm . There 's another one . Look . - They 're all laughing . - Oh ! New Years , Titan . We were so happy back then , Kryt . I had a species , I thought the two of us 'd be together for ever . Well , it may sound ridiculous now , sir , but one day , I 'm sure you 'll meet another species that 'll make you just as happy . No , I won 't ! No species 'll make me happy like the human race . I 'll never find another species like them . They were ... They were special . Sir , all I 'm saying is there are other species out there , and given time , who knows ? You never liked the human race , did you ? Quite honestly , sir , I never thought they were good enough for you . I never thought they were very nice to you , sir . Quite frankly , sir , I think you could do better . - What , better than the human race ? - Mmm . It may sound harsh , but you 've just got to get them out of your mind and get on with your life . Yeah , but everywhere I look reminds me of ' em . A couple of beers later on today , sir . That 'll take your mind off it . The human race invented beer . They were brilliant at inventing ' . They invented sofas and blankets and mops and floors and buckets . I just miss them so much . A change of scenery , sir , that 's what you need . Why don 't you get out and stretch your legs ? The human race had legs . I just can 't get away from them . Everywhere I look , it reminds me of them . Nothing compares to them . ♪ Nothing compares ♪ Nothing compares to them . ♪ I knew they 'd break his heart . Oh ! Human race - here one minute , gone the next . Fly-by-night flibbertigibbets ! Life . What 's it all about , then ? Why are we all here ? Why am I here ? What 's the point of everything ? 'I don 't know , Dave . 'White coffee , six sugars and a caramel crisp bar coming right up ! ' Haven 't you ever thought about it ? 'Not really , no . I 'm a vending machine . 'Are you OK ? 'You don 't seem your usual self today , 'asking intelligent questions , being philosophical . ' How d 'you know what my usual self is like ? 'I watch you . 'Through the crack in your door . 'The things you do when you 're alone are so funny ! ' I 've gotta get going . 'See you next time ! 'And if you want to talk things through about life and stuff , drop by any time . 'Oh , except Thursday morning . I might be out . 'Just kidding ! 'I 'll be here ! ' 'For ever ! ' Subbuteo tournament this weekend , Kryten . Not going out in the quarterfinals three years in a row . Just putting the boys through their paces . The flabsters don 't know what 's hit them . Er , an e-post from the JMC on-board computer , sir . Oh , yes ? What do they want ? They 've had a significant amount of letters over the years from high-ranking members of the JMC , sir , proposing you to be awarded the Golden Stripe Of Honour for your years of distinguished service . Gosh . Really ? They say they 've been told you 're a modest man who doesn 't seek the limelight , for your only concern is performing your duties . I 'm lost for words . Such kindness . Due to the number of these letters of recommendation , they have absolutely no option but to request you stop writing them . Oh , bollocking damn and jumbo buggers ! They go on to say , in dealing with this matter , they 've looked into your actual service record and have realised that you haven 't reported for duty in over three million years . But I 've been dead for most of that ! You are therefore being charged with gross dereliction of duty and you have 24 hours to present your rebuttal . What ? ! If they find you guilty , sir , you 'll be demoted ... to third technician . The same as Lister ? There 'll be no-one but you to obey my orders . What am I gonna do ? Help me . That 's an order . Oh , please , sir ! Don 't order me to help you . You know how much I hate helping you ! Kryten ! Very well , sir . Perhaps you could get a note from the medicomputer explaining you 're unfit for duty . Post-traumatic stress or something . I haven 't been the same since the crew got wiped out - need a note , post-dated . Too unwell to attend myself . Off you go . On my way , sir . Ahh , you ! Still moping around in your mopey clothes , listening to your mopey music , being all mopey ? - If you want my opinion ... - Which I don 't . .. it 's time you manned up . Listened to some brass band music . Went for a bracing hike in the diesel decks . Given the options , I 'll continue being suicidal , if it 's all the same to you . And don 't think this pity party 's going unnoticed . I 've noticed it . And I 've written it down in a special report . And let me tell you , m 'laddo , I pull no punches . Who 's gonna read this special report ? Well , me . And maybe others ... one day . And they 'll read , " You are the star of your own mopeathon . " You can 't even be bothered to get yourself a cup of tea any more . " You dunk your biscuits in the fish tank . " I 've seen you . I was watching TV ! As long as it 's wet and melty , you don 't care where you stick it . Look , Rimmer , I 'm depressed , man . Give me a break . And besides , I 'm a careful dunker now . Look left , look right , mirror , signal , dunk . It 's time you stopped feeling sorry for yourself , Lister . Every problem has an answer . Problem - your species is dead . Answer - make some more . And how am I gonna do that ? Well , you 've gotta prepare yourself , haven 't you ? Like a fighter pilot waiting to scramble . If the perfect woman walked through that door right now - and by perfect , I mean any female with working ovaries - you wouldn 't have a clue . Perfect woman walked through that door , I would be ready to scramble . What , you think your old moves would still work today ? You think that snaky , sneaky , arm-round-the-shoulder trick in a dark cinema is still cool ? Women today would die laughing at that move . That was my best move . I had a lot of success with that move . Women have moved on from that move . Moves don 't move on . Moves move on . What , moves move ? ! Right , here 's a Jacobean move . A Jaca-what ? Oh , my lady ! Thy beauty doth radiate across the Earth , like a raging forest fire consuming everything in its path , and reduces grown men to babbling fools . Do you think that move would work today ? Not a chance - dead move . The cloak across the puddle - dead move . Strumming a mandolin under the balcony - dead move . How d 'you know all this , Rimmer ? You know nothin ' about women . You know nothin ' about nothin ' . Remember that documentary we watched about breasts ? You thought " areolas " was a Spanish goalkeeper ? Well , what was he , Italian ? It 's not important . Look , you 've either got it or you ain 't , and I 've got it . I 'm gonna make meself a cup of coffee . Right , abusing the furniture . It 's all going down . Oh , thanks , 23 . I really needed a lift . 'No problem , David . 'How was zat soup I made you yesterday ? ' It was , er ... pretty delicious , actually . 'Ah , bon ! - ' I 'm glad you enjoyed eet . ' - Yeah , it was really nice . 'Magnifique ! ' So , um ... you look different . Have you changed something ? New facade ? Really suits you . You look , er ... shinier . 'No , same facade as always . ' Could 've sworn it 's different . - Maybe it 's the light . - ' Oui , maybe . ' Oh , it 's good coffee , this . Great coffee . Some amazing coffee . I 've always said to the others , you know , if you want a good cup of coffee , go to dispenser 23 - she makes the best coffee . - ' Are you ' itting on me ? ' - What ? No ! 'I 'm a vending machine - why are you trying to ' it on me ? ' - I 'm not trying to hit on you . - ' You so are . ' No , I 'm not ! I 'm really not . You just make good coffee , that 's all . ' " New facade , you look shinier " - zat was a move . ' - It was not a move ! - ' It so was a move . 'You were putting a move on me . ' You 're getting the wrong end of the stick . It was not a move , now please ! 'Why are you ' itting on a dispensing machine ? Who does zat ? ' - I 'm not ! I mean ... - Is everything OK , sir ? 'You know what he just tried to do ? He was ' itting on me . ' Hit ... hitting on her ! I mean ... of course I wasn 't hitting on her - she 's a vending machine ! Why would I hit on a vending machine ? I-I 'm sure there 's been some misunderstanding here . He put his hand on my logo . What ? When ? Look , I was leaning , it was a total accident ! 'Oh , leaning and you just happened to place your hand exactly on my logo . ' " Oops , sorry , didn 't notice it , " he said , as he gently grazed my logo . ' Unbelievable ! This is gonna go in the report . What news of my sabbatical ? I 'm afraid it 's not good , sir . The medicom said no ? It 's never liked me . It 's happy to give you a note if you have a genuine reason for time off , otherwise there 's nothing doing . Although I got the impression a charitable donation to the medical fund might not go unnoticed . Hmm . A little bribe . Not a bribe , sir - a donation . A big donation . Mm ! Where you gonna get major moolah like that ? Expenditure cuts , sir , from the supplies budget . I 've been looking at the ship 's inventory for potential savings , and it seems to me , for a ship this size , with this many toilet-active crew members ... Toilet-active crew members ? .. there 's an astonishing amount of toilet paper in the 2,143 restrooms going to waste . You what ? ! Toilet paper that never goes into action , never sees the field of battle . - Return the toilet paper ! - Hang on . Make the majority of the restrooms paper-free . I-I need that toilet paper ! Every sheet ! I 've got a diet that 's rich in fibre , curry and beer . The savings would be insane . We can get a reimbursement from Supplies and transfer that to the medical fund . As far as the supply budget is concerned , we 're just moving money around . It 's totally above board . I 'll get on it right away . - Great plan . - Lousy plan ! Buds , I 've got a question for you . What 's the best way to break bad news ? Well , generally speaking , sir , you tell the people to sit down and warn them that you 've got bad news . And what kind of face you got on ? A serious face , sir . Kindly but serious . Huh ! Kindly but serious . That 's what I thought ! I knew that ! Thanks , bud ! Buds , best you sit down . I 've got some bad news . Whoa , what is it ? What 's happened ? Is this about me ? It 's about me , isn 't it ? I 'm being replaced again , aren 't I , sir ? Everyone 's sitting down , then you say , - " Listen , I 've got bad news , " right ? - That 's correct , sir . OK , here comes the bad news . But I 'm gonna do it as char-aydes ! Char-aydes ? He means " char-ahdes " , sir . You know how much fun there is round here ? None ! It 's too good an opportunity to miss . OK , here we go . Remember , really bad news . Two words . Whole thing . Ho-hole . Er , black hole , we 're being sucked into a black hole . Er chameleonic mutants . Er , er , er , brain-eating chameleonic mutants on board . - A giant death worm ! - Something 's happened to Kochanski . She 's got a rogue virus . Rimmer 's got a rogue virus . I 've got a rogue virus ? - Explosion ? - Zombies , zombies ! I 'm being replaced , aren 't I , sir ? No-one likes me . People have complained - about the shape of my head . - Strangling ... A giant death worm . Giant death worm heading straight for us ... Crash , something 's crashed . Heading straight for us . I 'm being demoted . A woman ! A woman 's coming . - A woman . Shorter . - Small woman . Small . Male , man . - Male . - Post ! Mail pod ! Mail pod ! The mail pod 's arrived ! Brilliant , the mail pod 's arrived ! And something 's happened to it . It 's crashed . The mail pod 's crashed . - It exploded . - It turned into a giant death worm . It 's turned into a jacket . - A giant death worm 's come out of it . This is nothing to do with a giant death worm ! Where were you getting that from ? ! Oh ! Your clothes ... your clothes were on a ... on a washing line and a mail pod came in and crashed into your clothes ! Got it in one ! Your clothes are hanging on the line , and the mail pod crashed into them ? How 's that two words ? Cos when it happened , I said , " Oh , man ! " You know , if I had a giant death worm right now , I 'd stick it right down your stupid throat ! Hey , the mail 's arrived ! Lighten up - mail from Earth ! Death worm ? ! Two words ! That 's the last one , sirs . We must have sifted through about 1,000 letters now . One letter from home , that 's all I 'm asking - just one lousy , stinking letter . Look , 50 big ones says the first letter 's mine . Why is everything a competition with you ? Why can 't we just sit here and sort the mail like two mature adults instead of behaving like two schoolboys who have to bet on everything ? Oh , yes , I 've got one ! Arnold Rimmer ! The man , the myth , the legend ! Rimmsy , Rimmsy ! Mr Popular with a capital P , there 's no stopping him , here he goes ! Who 's it from ? It 's a parking fine . Still good . Still a letter - something to read addressed to me . 1-0 , Rimmsy . Is it ? Can it be ? It can 't be . Oh , but it is ! 1-1 ! The comeback kid ! This boy does not know the meaning of the word " defeat " ! 1-1 ! Go on , then , who 's it from ? Hayley Summers ? My God , Hayley Summers ! Hayley Summers ! I 'm guessing it 's from Hayley Summers ? I used to go out with Hayley Summers . It 's when I was trying to be a rock god . What I lacked technically I made up for in loudness . I mean , when I played , people had ringing in their ears . How long for ? It didn 't go away . Once they had it , they had it for good . That 's how loud I was . So where did you meet her , then ? At a gig ? She worked in the bank where I had my overdraft . We got talking , and badda-boom , badda-bish , badda-baa . And , um , she dumped you , right ? No , she didn 't dump me , actually , Rimmer . She got offered a dream job on Callisto , couldn 't turn it down . The only girl I ever cared about who didn 't dump me , actually . The time we had together was brilliant , man . We 'd stay home all day Saturday , watch zero-gee , eat curry in bed . The first person I ever heard say , " The real McCoy " . " That 's the real McCoy , " she 'd say . " This is the real McCoy . That curry is the real McCoy . " And she squidged up her nose , like that , when she was telling a story . No , no , it was really cute . And did you used to tell your friends about the real McCoy and the squidgy nose thing ? And did you find your friends were suddenly emigrating or pretending to be dead ? Still smells of her perfume . Look , I ... I don 't wanna read this . It 'll make me miss home more than ever . I 'll read it . " Dear Dave , I hope you don 't mind me writing to you , - " but I 've got a confession . " - Confession ? Bet she was a man . Well , you said yourself she liked zero-gee and curries . Bet you she was a man . Did she have big feet ? When you did the foxtrot , did you ever wonder why she was shaving ? Just-just tell me the confession . - Oh , wow . - What ? - No way ! - What ? ! I don 't know whether to laugh or laugh . " Dave , I don 't know how to tell you this , " but I 'm pregnant . " Seven weeks , according to the doctor . " Pregnant ? Hang on , my head 's on spin cycle here . Are you saying that I 'm three million years into deep space and she 's pregnant with my baby ? ! Well , put it this way - you 're in the finals . Finals ? What d 'you mean ? Who 's the other finalist ? Who am I playing ? Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah ... " I don 't know whether it 's yours or Roy 's . " Thought you should know . " Roy ? Ah , not Roy ? ! Not Roy Roy ! D 'you mean she was sleeping with Roy ? Who 's the dad , me or him ? She doesn 't know , she 's going for a DNA test . She must 've written another letter to tell me the result . You 've gotta help me find it , we need to find it . Yellow envelope . Yellow envelope ! Hi , 34 . Just having a break . Coffee , please . 'Oh , you want something from me now , do you ? ' Yeah , coffee . 'Don 't play dumb , Dave . I heard what happened . ' - Happened ? - ' With dispensing machine 23 . 'You didn 't think I 'd find out , did you ? ' - What ? ! - ' All those drinks 'and chocolate bars you were getting off me , and at the same time , 'you were drinking her drinks and snaffling up her choccy bars , too , weren 't you ? 'Weren 't you ? ! ' She was just nearer . 'She 's such a trashy-looking machine . 'Is that what you like , Dave ? Trashy ? ' You all look identical ! - ' Ohh ! ' - Look , can I please just get a coffee ? - ' I 'm out of coffee . ' - I 'll have a tea . 'No tea . ' Milkshake ? 'Let me just check . 'Sorry , no milkshakes either . ' Look , I 'll go somewhere else , then . You 're not the only dispenser on board . 'Why don 't you do that ? I think it might be best all round . ' Well , I will . - ' Good . ' - Fine . - ' Suits me . ' - Right , I 'm off . 'Not missing you already . ' Coincidentally , no big deal , but know your tea - it 's a bit watery . And you know when I said that your Mexican red-hot chilli crisps were really spicy ? Well , I was lying . - ' I can 't believe you said that ! ' - Well , I did . 'Ohh ! ' How did it go with the medicomputer ? Well , it took the donation , sir . And what did we get ? A thank you . Is that it ? I think it does this all the time , sir - misleads unsuspecting bribers to get them to give money to the medical fund . That 's outrageous ! Has it got no morals at all ? It repeated that the only way it could give you an absence from duty note was if you are unwell or you 'd taken a sabbatical to care for an unwell member of the crew . Lister ! Post-traumatic stress . Missing the human race , dunking biscuits in the fish tank , totally off the rails . Well , most of that could be dismissed as eccentricity rather than illness , sir . If you 're going to use Mr Lister in your defence , I fear you need something more . Hmm . One act of saliva-dripping , mouth-foaming insanity by midnight tonight . Shouldn 't be too hard . Hey , bud . Alphabet Head told me what happened . Come to check you out . So , who is this Roy dude ? He used to work with her in the bank . He was always using the finger-wetting machine to count the money . Real creep . Could I give you a bit of advice ? Don 't think about them together . - Just move on . - Right . Keep all those " them together " thoughts right out of your head . Yeah , right . All the walking in the park , kissing raindrops off her nose stuff - don 't think about any of that . I used to love her nose . She used to squidge it up when she told stories . And don 't be tempted to wonder if she squidged up her nose for him in that really cute way she used to squidge up her nose for you , cos the chances are , she did . - You reckon ? - And another thing . Don 't start thinking about all those late-night shifts she was always doing , because if it was me , I 'd be thinking , like , " Hey ! " Banks all close at five . " Yeah , she was always doing late-night shifts . You know , supervising the delivery of the unstealable pens . Or staying behind to help update the bank queue waiting-pole rope . Or accidentally locking herself in the vault for the whole weekend . She used to always do that . Hey , you don 't think she was with this Roy guy ? The whole damn time . - It never even occurred to me . - But the key is , don 't think about it . I 'm not thinking about it . - Think of something else . - I 'm thinking of something else ! Good ! Cos if you start thinking about all those hours you were sitting at home , killing time , while she was probably on all fours , covered in money ... .. while his finger-wetting machine was working overtime ... .. it 'll drive you crazy ! Now , you get a picture like that in your head , it 's real hard to get rid of . What you doing ? What d 'you think I 'm doing ? I told you not to think about it ! I 'm thinking about it now ! That 's unbelievable ! You 've not listened to a word I 've said . Still nothing , sir ? You know , I 'm starting to think she never even wrote a second letter . Oh , sir , I know this has stirred things up a bit , but I really believe you 've got to live in the present . You 've got new friends now . True , they may not be human , and some of them are annoying and stupid and petty and maybe even insane , but that doesn 't mean they 're any less precious . You 've got to forget about the past and look after the present . Hiya . 'Oh , it 's you . 'This is awkward . ' Look , I 'm sorry about before . I just wanna know if there 's any way I can make it up to you . - ' Really ? ' - Yep . 'Oh , Dave ! 'I don 't know why we fight like this . 'We 're so silly ! So what 's it to be , then ? New paint job , new nozzle housings ? How about a restock ? - ' Anything ? ' - Anythin ' . You name it . 'Well , if I could have anything , absolutely anything , 'I 've always wanted ... 'to see around the corner . ' What , down there round the corner ? 'Oh , I know it 's crazy , 'but it 's always been a wild dream of mine . 'I 've heard stories , but to actually see it myself ... 'I can 't believe I 'm actually going ! - ' Isn 't this romantic ? ' - Well ... don 't build your hopes up too much . It might not be as great as you think . Da-daaaan ! - Well ? - ' Oh ! Ohhh ! 'It 's everything I thought it was and more . 'Oh ! Oh , Dave . 'Maybe we could stay here . 'You and me . 'I know it 's ... crazy , 'but we could settle down here . 'Hm ? Start a new life ! 'Oh , put me back there by the wall . 'Oh ! - ' Oh , Dave ! ' - Smeg , sorry ! 'I knew you 'd come round , you naughty boy ! 'Rrrrar ! ' I 'll get you up . 'Oh ! Dave ! 'Dave ! Naughty boy ! 'Wow ! 'I have never seen a ceiling . ' Rimmsy , Rimmsy , Rimmsy ! Oh , yes ! CCTV ! Sabbatical note , here we come ! What would you have me do with these , sir ? Ohh . What did I tell you , sir ? I knew you 'd find another species to settle down with ! I 'm just tryin ' to pick her up . Looks like you 're well past that stage to me , sir . Damn paper ! There 's gotta be some somewhere . Ahh ! Ooh ! Guhh ! Damn near walked three miles ! Hey ... Uhhh ! Hee-hee-hee-hee ! Oh ! That 's every letter checked , sir . It wasn 't there . Oh , well . Thanks , Krytes . Never mind , third technician ! Three decks , not one single roll ! Hey , that 's mine . The hell it is . I found it . I need it . - Give it here ! - I need to wipe ! You see what you guys have done to us ? This is madness ! Madness ! That 's my special report ! It won 't be special in a minute . I 've realised now this might be it . This might be the answer as to why I feel so empty . I mean , if she had my kids , that means my kids might have had kids . There might be hundreds of generations spawned by me . I might have had a daughter who was a doctor or a great-great-great-great-great - great-great-great-great-grandson who was a zero-gee football star . No matter what happens to me now , I feel like I 've contributed . I am someone . Man , I hope it 's mine , because I know , with her as a mother , they would have been the best kids they could possibly be , cos I mean , she was a wonderful woman , and I 'm sure she 'd have been an even more wonderful mother . Wish me luck . What an absolute slag .

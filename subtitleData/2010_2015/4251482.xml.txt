 This is where Sarah Jane Smith lives . And it 's home to things way beyond your imagination . There 's an extraterrestrial supercomputer in the wall , her son , a genetically engineered boy genius , a schoolgirl investigator across the road , and a whole universe of adventure , right here on the doorstep . Ready ? Always . No , cos I had to do this essay . 2,000 words on pendulum physics . It was fascinating , but then everyone wanted to go out for a burger , and I thought , " Why not ? " So we all went into town , and ... Well , I hope you finished your work . Sanjay owes me five quid , I bet him you 'd say that ! Right , and who 's Sanjay ? Oh , he 's just down the hall . He 's brilliant . We just clicked straight away . He 's smart , he 's cool , he keeps making me laugh . I think he 's the best mate I 've ever had all my life . Oh , your face ! That is brilliant ! What ? ! I ... Oh , that is such a classic ! Forget next week , swot boy , you 're on your own . ALARM BLARES Emergency broadcast ! UNIT armed forces are converging on this house , Sarah Jane . Right now ! Stop right there ! I 'm not having soldiers on my property . Everything OK ? Yes , fine . They 're just leaving . Miss Smith , my name is Colonel Tia Karim , representing the Unified Intelligence Task Force . If I could have a word in private ? No , you 're not getting any closer . Just tell me . What do you want ? I 'm sorry , but it 's my solemn duty to inform you that your friend , the Doctor , is dead . Don 't be stupid . He can 't be . Last Sunday , at 1700 hours , the body of a Time Lord was returned to the earth . UNIT scientists have checked the DNA results , and it 's definitely him . I 'm sorry , Miss Smith , for your loss . Sorry for the whole wide world , because he 's gone . The Doctor 's gone . He 's dead . The Doctor was found 10,000 light years away , by a race called the Shansheeth . They sent us this . It 's called an epitaph stone . It 's a recording device , the equivalent to a death notice . The Shansheeth are what you might call ... intergalactic undertakers . Oh , come on . This is ridiculous ! There 's no such thing ! Sarah Jane , I can confirm the Shansheeth are known throughout the universe as the carers of the dead . It is said they trawl the battlefields of outer space , looking for heroes to bring home . Yeah ? Well , that 's quite enough from you , thanks ! Just shut up . Play this thing . I bring condolences from the Claw Shansheeth of the 15th Funeral Fleet upon this terrible day . Well ! As if you 'd trust that thing ? Just look at him ! Hey , that 's not fair . Since when did we judge by appearances ? Since this lot started lying ! OK . But look . I hope this is all a big mistake , I really do . For the Doctor 's sake we 've got to find the facts , which means ... we stop and we listen . Yeah . Thanks . Mr Smith ? The Shansheeth did journey to the wastelands of the Crimson Heart , whereupon we found the body of the last Time Lord . Witnesses say that he perished saving the lives of 500 children from the Scarlet Monstrosity . Sounds like him . The Doctor 's home world is long since lost . But legends talk of his love for the earth . Therefore , the Shansheeth will return the Doctor to the human race . Oh , weep for him , peoples of the earth . Mourn his loss , for the universe feels darker tonight . So what do you think ? UNIT will take charge of the funeral in conjunction with the Shansheeth . We 'll be using UNIT Base 5 , situated inside Mount Snowdon . We can arrange transport and accommodation for all of you . Thank you . Then you 'll come ? Oh , yes . Nothing 's going to make me miss this . I 'll be there . So what was all that about , with the soldiers and stuff ? She 's weird , Sarah Jane , there 's always something happening over ... Hey , what 's that for ? ! Don 't you ever go anywhere , OK ? Not even to the shops ? Nope . Not anywhere . Promise ? I promise . I always thought if ever the Doctor dies , I 'll know . Somehow I 'll just feel it . Wherever he is , if he 's far away on some distant star or lost in the depths of dark ages , I 'll know . But I didn 't . I didn 't feel a thing . I know , Mum , but it doesn 't actually mean anything . No , maybe it does , though . Cos I don 't think he 's dead . He can 't be ! Yeah , I 'm going to go to that funeral , Luke , but only to find out what 's going on . Because I think the Doctor 's still alive . Luke says Sarah Jane 's gone mad . Don 't be so rude . He wouldn 't say " mad " about his own mother . No . He said , " Nutty , fruity , loop-the-loop , tonto barmy bonkers . " Be fair , though , sir , he 's worried . It 's like your mum . Remember when Grandad died ? She washed everything . Curtains . Furniture . Me . She even washed the walls . Who washes walls ? It went on for days , and then she just started crying . It takes time . Cos when someone dies it 's so massive , it 's like you can 't fit it all inside your head . That 's what Sarah Jane 's doing . She 's denying it . So , what do we do ? Wait . That 's all you can do . Friends just wait . Bang on time . Don 't worry , Haresh , I 'll look after them . Sorry to hear your bad news . There 's no need . I 'm fine . Bye . Keep the school running without me , sir . While I head off in my nice , big , posh motor . Argh ! Did you see that ? ! Static electricity . If you paid more attention in class ... Come on , you , get in ! Now THAT is what I call a base ! TANNOY : ' Silo 15 now entering decontamination . 'Staff to holding position . Repeat . All staff to holding position . ' We 've allocated bedrooms . The funeral will take place at 0900 hours tomorrow , so that gives you time to acclimatise . The doors to the funeral wing will be sealed at 2100 hours . This is still a working military base , so you 'll only have access to the specified areas . That 's nice ( ! ) Bring us all this way to tell us we 're not trusted . So who else is coming ? Well , it 's all been a bit of a rush . The Brigadier 's stranded in Peru , and Miss Shaw can 't make it back from Moonbase until Sunday . You 've got a moonbase ? ! Oh , man , I am running out of reactions . You 've got Graske ! What are you doing with Graske ? I knew it . I said there was something going on . Sorry , what 's the problem ? We 've met Graske before , and believe me , they 're trouble ! Oh , they 're not Graske , they 're Groske . Groske very different ! Groske are blue ! Hate Graske ! Graske make me stamp my feet ! The Groske were stranded on earth in 2006 . We took them in , and they 've been earning their keep as workmen . Groske build rocket for funeral ! Come and see , come and see ! Rocket X-15 will take the Doctor 's body into space , sealed inside a lead-lined coffin . Then he 'll be set free . In death , as in life . Very poetic . I think it 's beautiful . Just what he deserves . What about the TARDIS ? There was no sign of it . The body was found all alone . Blimey , though ! Not a bad way to go ! That 's a real , proper rocket . GROSKE : Boy smells ! Oh , thanks a bunch ( ! ) You short little titch ! Clyde , of all the things for you to laugh at , height ? Yeah , you smelly bad smell-boy . You blue , bluey blueness . This area 's about to be sealed off as part of the curfew . I can take you to your bedrooms . The Shansheeth are holding a gathering of remembrance . Just watch it , you . But you see ? So bright ! You smell of time . What do you mean ? He 's coming ! I 'm so sorry for your loss . I 'm so sorry for your loss . The Claw Shansheeth invites you to spend tonight reflecting in the memories of a loved one lost . WHISPERS : So who are all these people ? Old soldiers . It 's not easy to find friends of the Doctor . He 'd come and go without a trace . Think of all the lives he touched . The whole planet should be in mourning . But no-one knows . Can I see him ? I don 't think you 'd want to . That sounds to me like you 're hiding something . Sarah Jane , he was hurt . Hey , come on , let 's go and sit down . I don 't even know what he looks like . I 'm sorry ? I think he regenerated , cos the last time I saw him he didn 't say a word , he just looked at me , as though ... That body could have a different face , and I wouldn 't even know if it was him or not . Honoured guests steeped in grief and misery , this is the cradle of the lost chord . Its bittersweet melody ... If you don 't mind , I just need to gather my thoughts on my own . Yeah , sure . Close your eyes . Remember . Come on ! GLASS SMASHES Oh , sorry , just ignore me . I brought flowers , which was silly , really . There 's no need , is there ? But I saw these lilies , and I thought they were appropriate . Oh , and the vase was so beautiful . It was hand-blown by Asian-Argentines . Well , I don 't suppose it was actually hand-blown , because , well , glass would get really , really hot . I 'm so sorry for your loss . Oh , thank you . Oh , aren 't you lovely ? I 'm so sorry for your loss . I know , it 's terrible , isn 't it ? You are so gorgeous . I wish I had my glasses . You 're like a vulture , a great , big alien vulture . Babe , aren 't they wonderful ? No , no , no , don 't be afraid . It 's just like I taught you . You know , I 've missed all this . Hey , listen , babe , can you do something with those for me ? There 's a good boy . Thanks . I 'm sorry , I 'm making an awful lot of noise , aren 't I ? Although there is this tribe called the Nambikwara . You know , from the Mato Grosso . I lived there for about six months in ' 83 . When there 's a funeral , they sing all night . I mean , they sound like birds . Honestly , it is the most astonishing sound I 've ever heard . Sorry , um , do I know you ? We 've never actually met , but ... It 's Jo Grant , isn 't it ? Wow ! It 's a long time since I 've been called that . Actually it 's Jo Jones since I got married . I arrived just after you left . You 'd gone to live on the Amazon . Oh , they told me about you ! You must be ... Sarah Jane Smith . Oh , darling ! After all this time ! Oh , and look at you . Oh , you 're so beautiful ! Sorry . That 's my gran . You 'll get used to her . She looks fantastic . I 'm Rani . And I 'm Clyde , mate . You all right ? Yeah . My name 's Santiago . Wow , good name ! Yeah , it 's where I was born ... in a caravan at the foothills of the Andes . They should 've called you Andy ! With respect , the cradle will continue . I think he 's telling us to behave . It 's like being at a school assembly . Wouldn 't know . Never been to school . What ? How come ? We 're always travelling the world . What , are you rich ? No , just the opposite . But Mum and Dad , they got it from Gran . She 's spent her life going from country to country . Doing what ? Protesting . Like that G8 summit - she chained herself to the railings . And that climate change conference - Dad got arrested . Twice . Mum 's in Japan trying to stop whaling ships . Wow ! Serious life . Yeah . Just to get here today , we were on the southern plateau of the Tierra del Fuego . So we had to hike to Buenos Aires , get a boat to Las Malvinas , and a cargo plane across the Atlantic . Where are you guys from ? BOTH : Ealing . Oh , they used to tell so many stories about you at UNIT . Those soldier boys . Oooh , happy days ! So you 're still married ? Oh , yes . He 's picketing an oil rig in the Ascension Islands at the moment . And I 've got seven children . Seven ! And Santiago is one of 12 grandchildren . Would you believe , number 13 on its way ? How about you , sweetie ? Oh , I 've got a son . He 's called Luke , he 's just gone to university . Oh , no dad on the picture . Ah , playing the field . Good on you , girl ! No , not exactly , but ... Oh , it 's funny , all of this today , cos it got me thinking . Cos the Doctor showed me such a remarkable life , and when he went , it just took me a long while to get over it . Me too . You know , sometimes I think I 've never stopped running . Then he came back , and I realised the life I wanted was right under my nose all that time . Who came back ? The Doctor ? Yeah . Recently ? Oh , about four years ago . I ... I never saw him again . Oh , well , it was just a coincidence . The first time , we were both investigating this case . The first time ? You mean it was more than once ? Yeah . Oh . He must have really liked you . You know , it 's funny , but I have this notion . If the Doctor died one day , I mean , even if he was as far away as Metebelis Three , that ... Well , that I 'd feel it . You know , in my heart . That 's exactly what I thought . But I didn 't feel a thing . Nor me . Not a peep . Do you think the same as me ? What ? Because I think ... BOTH : He 's still alive ! Right . We need to make a list , because we need to work out who 'd fake the Doctor 's death , and why . Ah , and these can help us to think ! They 're scented with jatamansi oil . It 's a herb from the banks of the Ganges . It helps to focus the mind . We 'll just go and get some tea . Oh , no , no , no , just hot water for me , please , sweetheart . I 've got some powdered lapacho . You know , the Doctor took me to this planet once , called Peladon , and the smell of lapacho ... Well , it reminds me of the Royal Palace . I went to Peladon ! You never did ! With the great beast Aggedor ? Same planet ! OK . Laters . TANNOY : ' funeral wing now closing . Repeat , funeral wing now closing . ' It 's tragic . He 's dead , but they just can 't face it . I never met the Doctor . I always wanted to , but ... Too late . I wish he was here right now . Yeah , me too . No , I really wish he was here right now cos then he could explain this . It 's happening again ! I know ! But I can 't say anything , can I ? ! Not inside UNIT - they 'd lock me up and dissect me ! Hold on , what do you mean , it 's happening again ? Well , last time we met the Doctor , it was at Sarah Jane 's wedding , and we got stuck in this time loop thing . And the TARDIS , the Doctor 's time machine , it was phasing in and out of reality . I touched it , and got zapped with this stuff . Artron energy , the Doctor said . I think it was part of the TARDIS . Whoa ! And you thought my life was good ? ! Smelly getting closer ! What do you know about this stuff ? Closer and closer ! Oi ! Come back here , blue boy ! He 's like a mouse in the skirting board ! You coming ? Yeah . Honestly , it 'll be fine . We do this kind of thing all the time . Hey , my gran once handcuffed herself to Robert Mugabe . I 'm loving it ! Oi ! Groske ! Where are you ? ! Clyde ! Keep it down ! This is a top-secret military base and they might shoot us dead . Oh , and I kind of promised my dad I 'd be in bed by 10.30pm. Brothers of the wing , I have filleted the cradle to find the most powerful memories . With what results ? The women . The two wise women of the tribe . They remember the late Doctor most strongly of all . The cradle sings ! Surround them with song ! Tempt them with days long past ! The memories must grow if we are to succeed . HE PLAYS HARP There 's that music again . Reminds me ... The Doctor took me to this planet once , called Karfel , and they had a leisure garden , and the plants could sing . He took me to Italy ... once . San Martino , 1492 . I remember this magnificent garden . It smelled of oranges , vanilla ... Deeper ! The sleep of memories ! Drashigs , Axons , Ogrons , the Daleks ... Cybermen , Zygons ... Azal ... The trap has worked . Such excellent and sorrowful memories . What have we stopped for ? Hush a minute . Clyde , I 'm staring at your bum . No , seriously , ssh ! The women are named Smith , Sarah Jane , and Jones , Josephine . We must drain their minds . What of their bodies ? They will die . Fortunately , there are excellent undertakers at hand . Guys , back up . We have to get out of here . ELECTRICAL BUZZING No , no , no , no , no ! Back up , back up , back up ! We are witnessed ! There 's no room to turn round . Go backwards ! Shuffle ! SHANSHEETH ROARS Faster ! Shuffle for your life ! Fly fast , my brothers ! Stop them ! Stop the children ! Jo ? Jo , wake up ! What ? Rani ? Clyde ? Where is everyone ? I think there 's something wrong . Wrong ? You mean just like the old days sort of wrong ? Exactly like the old days . Oh , groovy ! We 've got to get out of here , OK ? OK . There you are ! Sarah Jane , it 's the Shansheeth . They 're lying through their beaks . They want you and Jo . This whole thing 's a trap . I knew it ! Hold on ! If they 're lying , that means the Doctor 's still alive ! Yes ! Of course I am . I thought that was obvious . Catch up ! I beg your pardon ? Clyde ? Is that you ? Course it 's not , it 's me ! I 'm using Clyde as a receiver . I 've keyed into his residual artron energy for a very complicated swap across 10,000 light years . Hold on . HE YELLS That wasn 't me ! That wasn 't me speaking ! I 'm getting ... That 's not my hand . Cos my hand 's not white . Sorry , Clyde , but ... this ... space ... Noooo ! .. is ... taken ! Good . So . Gosh . That was different . Hello , everyone ! Who are you ? Where 's Clyde ? Come on , Rani , use your brain ! Clyde and I swapped places . I 'm where he was , he 's where I was . Which means , right now ... Oooh , he 's in a lot of trouble . Doctor ? Doctor ! You bring him back , whoever you are ! No , no , no , no , no , Rani , don 't you see ? It 's you , isn 't it ? Ah , you 've done it again . Hello , Sarah Jane . Doctor ? That 's the Doctor ? What Doctor ? THE Doctor ? MY Doctor ? Well , he can change his face . I know , but into a baby 's ? Oi , imagine it from my point of view . Last time I saw you , Jo Grant , you were , what , 21 , 22 ? It 's like someone baked you . Hey , everyone ! Meanwhile ! Ah , yes , the Claw Shansheeth of the 15th Funeral Fleet . I 've been looking for you . Have you been telling people I 'm dead ? I apologise . The death notice was released a little too soon . Though I can rectify this , immediately ! I 'm so sorry for your loss , Doctor . Rest in peace ! Sounds like a countdown . Run ! Clear this place , seal it off . Keep that lot trapped . The memory weave is ready . Not even the Doctor will able to stop the crusade of the Shansheeth . Faster , faster , faster ! They 're trying to boil us ! We 're coming ! That 's what this is all about . The TARDIS , and you . They 've stopped . The key ! It takes shape ... Sarah Jane ! Try to think of something else ! I can 't ! Neither can I ! Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd E-mail subtitling @ bbc.co.uk

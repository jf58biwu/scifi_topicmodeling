 ABIGAIL : Previously on Warehouse 13 ... It wasn 't the marriage that I was trying to keep secret . It was me , the guy I was before . Pete , the drunk . You 've never met that guy , and I don 't ever want you to . Charlotte Dupres . Who , as it turns out , is a rival of mine . If I blow your heart out of your chest , do you think that would stop you ? And when my cheating husband is once again out in the world ... But I have plans too . Morning , Mrs. Labelle . Hi , Terry . Oh , my God ! Help me , I 'm burning up ! His name was Terry Chambers , District Attorney in Marlon , Ohio . Poisoned out of nowhere in his driveway this morning . Arsenic in his coffee ? No , he hadn 't eaten anything in eight hours , and there were no visible track marks . Cause of death , muscle paralysis , and lungs collapsed , and heart attack . That 's why I 'm sending you and Pete . Where is Pete by the way ? He 's at his yearly physical . ( LOUD THUD ) ( PANTING ) Oh , God , no . Is it time for those ? Yeah , wait till you hit over 50 and the real fun begins . ( LAUGHS ) What is that ? Oh , this is just the last of the stuff that I had at my mom 's . She needed the space . ( LAUGHS ) You have a flight in an hour , so ... Right , I 'm on my way . Hey , Steve , do you smell ... Yes , I do ! You know , Abigail , it is , uh , spectacularly nice of you , but you didn 't have to go through the trouble to bake us scones . Bake you scones ? Oh no , this is my breakfast . Yeah , they 're from that cute little bakery over on Third . Oh , okay . Yeah . Yeah , whenever Pete talks about that place , he gets a little ... Drool . Drool right here , yeah . Yeah , but if somebody wanted to do the dishes , I would consider sharing one of my scones . Ooh , uh ... Did somebody say scones ? Actually , you don 't have time for breakfast , because you and Steve , you 've got a ping of your own . I was kind of hoping I ... A 15-year-old boy went into some kind of fugue state in a park in New York City , and he graffitied some seriously advanced math on the wall . Ooh , that sounds fascinating . It does ? Yeah , don 't you think ? Okay , I 'm officially jaded . Really ? Because Abigail and I , we were going to flush out the Neutralizer Annex , but if you would really rather stay ... Nope ! Thank you . ( SINGING ) Lovin ' the fugue ! Come along , Jinksy . I 'll stay . You 'll what , now ? You 're gonna stay ? Yeah , I would love to just unpack all that junk . Yeah , but wouldn 't you rather do that after they flush out the neutralizer ? Wait , wait , wait , wait . I 've hogged all the neutralizer fun for 30 years . If Steve would rather stay , we should let him stay . Might as well . Yes , and I could use a little bit of action in the field . And I think you and I would rather hit our stride chasing Beethoven 's bust , so shall we ? ( LAUGHING ) All right , Bilbo Baggins , you 're on . Let 's go . I have to pack , though . Oh , you go ... And I 'll go ... Yeah . Okay , what are you doing ? Nothing ! Grip strength is the first muscle to go . MYKA : Well , I know how important that is to you . Can I help you ? Yeah , we 're looking for Terry Chambers ' house . Oh , Secret Service , huh ? I recognize that badge from the website . Are you here about the DA 's death ? Oh , Hummingbird Lane , you make a left , 2141 . Okay ? I 'm here for backup . PETE : Jeez , this place looks like a ' 50s TV show . What ? I have to do the other side . ( BLOWS WHISTLE ) ( BOTH GASP ) You can 't park here , mister . Visitors park in visitor parking . Secret Service . I don 't care if you 've got the POTUS in the back seat . I 'm Colonel Arnold Cassel , President of the Board here . I 'll have you towed . Okay , you wanna go ? Okay , wait , wait ! No , you 're staying inside . It 's okay , sir . We ... will move . We 'll move . Rules are rules , soldier . It 's a slippery road to hell once you start breaking ' em . ( BLOWS WHISTLE ) ( SIGHS ) Gated communities , for when you really miss boot camp . A guy is dead , and all they care about are parking rules . ( SHOUTING ) Talk about twisted priorities ! Okay , what is going on ? First your hand exercise thing , and now ... Then you yell at an old guy ? ( SIGHS ) Oh , my God , you had your physical this morning , is everything okay ? Yeah , no . No , nothing , no news . Then why are you speeding up ? Okay , Mykes , the doctor may have said that my ... Testosterone was a little low . Oh , well that means ... Oh , you know , he said it was no big deal . Oh . You know ? But then I read online that it could cause infertility , loss of sex drive , and ... ED . Hi , there . Hey . Janice Molloy , 26 , right over there . There it is . Yup , and you are ? I 'm Agent Bering , this is Agent Lattimer . We 're with the Secret Service . Agents , I knew it . Are you guys here to investigate DA Chambers ' death ? You think it was murder ? Why , do you think it was murder ? I certainly hope not , but ... ( SCOFFS ) With what happened a few nights ago ... To the DA ? You haven 't heard ? The DA forgot to park his car in his garage , and somebody broke his windshield . ( MIMICS GLASS BREAKING ) Nobody saw who , but we all saw the windshield . Anyhoo , I must dash , good luck to you . 26 , right over there . If I can help you in any way . Toodles . Yeah . Toodles . Thank you , Gladys Kravitz . Do you think that I really need to wear ... Oh ! Uh ... That 's a bit much , don 't you think ? Oh no , after what happened while the Warehouse was trying to grow ? I am not taking any chances . Suit yourself . Pun intended . ( BUBBLING ) Oh , okay . Something here is dead . Oh ! So , a 15-year-old boy ? Yeah , Nick Powell . He did all of this in a trance ? Yeah , and according to two witnesses , radiating some kind of light . So when do we meet Nick ? You know ... Huh ? Oh , in about an hour . Nurse said he was getting an MRI . I just ... I see algorithmic physics , I see differential calculus . You know there 's code on the other side . It looks like C + + or Java . Well maybe we should go to his home and talk to his parents . Nick 's got no parents , or a home . He lives over there . Nice box . I used to have one like that . Lost the lease . So , Rodger , do you know if your stepdad brought home anything old or antique-y lately ? Well , it 's Rodge , and ... And I don 't know , uh , my mom might . She should be home soon . What about his windshield ? We heard somebody broke it a few nights ago . Okay , well you know what ? It wasn 't me . I wasn 't even here . Are you guys ... Are you guys really Secret Service ? Look , Rodger ... Rodge ! Rodge ... Mmm-hmm . Did your stepdad receive any threats lately ? Wait , what , threats ? Well , he sent six men to death row in 15 years . I mean , surely someone nicknamed " DA Gas Chambers " must have made some enemies . Wait , are you guys saying that Terry was murdered ? 'Cause I just thought he had a stroke . We 're just covering our angles . Dude , that is ... That 's messed up . I don 't know anything about his work . Right , uh , thanks ... Rodge . Right . Um , Pete ? So I got the forensics report . They found sodium thiopental , Pavulon , and potassium chloride in his blood , all of which are used in lethal injections . Right , so maybe it 's some kind of execution artifact in the hands of a grieving death row family member . Right , I 'll get Steve to look into those death row cases . ( SIREN WAILING ) I 'll go look into that . Hey , hey . What 's going on ? Hysterical woman , says she 's stuck . ( WOMAN SCREAMING ) WOMAN : Oh , help ! We 're stuck ! Stuck to what ? To each other ! ( WHIMPERING ) So , Spencer , this is not your home ? Uh , no , it 's ... It 's my parents ' . They 're in Miami . So you were just ... Just sittin ' around ? Chillaxin ' , just kickin like a chicken ? Uh , yeah , just , uh ... Working . I just sort of reached , and then it just kind of happened . ( MIMICS GUNSHOT ) What were you working on ? Oh , uh , my website . Website . Yeah . Uh ... Uh , Spencer is this crazy web guru , and , um , I have this candle business and ... But ... ( WHINING ) Have you two crazy kids come into contact with any strange objects lately ? No , I ... What about DA Chambers ? Have you ... Have you crossed paths with DA Chambers ? Well my husband , Gerry , worked for the DA 's office before he got fired a few days ago . Why ? Excuse me a moment . Hey ! Hey ! I know it sounds insane , but they 're totally joined at the waist , like Siamese twins , and I 'm thinking coo coo ca-choo , Mrs. Robinson . So you think that she was fooling around with this , uh ... This younger guy ? I thought that they were working on their laptops . Yeah , right , well , that 's what he said . But I noticed that his computer was off , and I saw him kick some motion lotion underneath the couch . So while his computer may have been off , his laptop was definitely on . So Mr. Labelle gets fired by DA Chambers , and then finds out that his wife is cheating on him with this kid . Right , and uses an artifact to even the score . But what kind of artifact poisons and conjoins ? Unless he has two artifacts ... God , this stench . It 's like when something bad goes bad . Yeah , well that 's what the goo smells like after it neutralizes an artifact . Relieving the pressure helps normalize it . So did you unpack your stuff ? Not yet . That 's not really why you stayed , is it ? No . Well , it was , but not only that ... I guess . Okay , I 'll bite . Talk to me . I don 't know , I ... I guess it was a combination of saying goodbye to my ex all over again , and then the trunk arriving . It suddenly occurred to me that ... Literally , my entire life is here now . I 'm finally completely settled here , permanently . Like Pete , and Myka , and Claudia ... And that 's a bad thing ? No ... They say you get to share your Warehouse life with one very important person . And none of them have found anybody , and I 'm about 10 times more shy than they are . I mean ... Uh , Steve ? I 've got to think about this . I mean , Is this kind of thing that I want for a guy like me ? Because I 'm already so nervous . Oh , Steve , watch out ! ( ABIGAIL SCREAMS ) Oh , God ... Are you okay ? Yeah , no , I 'm fine , I ... I 'm really good . I 'm good . Is there something I should do ? Maybe hose you down ? No , no , no thanks , I 'm , uh ... I 'm just gonna go have a shower with some shred of dignity left . Be careful ! So , Nick , it happened again , huh ? I guess so , about an hour ago . Yeah , you wanna tell me about it ? ( SCOFFS ) Why , so you 'll think I 'm crazy too ? I don 't think you 're crazy . Forget it , if you 're trying to put me back in foster care , I won 't go . Whoa , no . We are so not Social Services , okay ? So you can relax . Right . Good . I believe everything you say . Well , you have no reason to believe everything I say , but I did go through the system , and I 'm not a fan . I know it can suck . You were in foster care ? Yeah . And I wasn 't about to go looking for any more abusive father figures to smack me around , so I did my time on the streets instead . Yeah ? Where ? Minneapolis . Three months . Wouldn 't recommend it in February . And even that was warmer than the psych ward . Look , I understand being locked up for talking about something unexplainable . I really do . We are the guys who explain the unexplainable . Buddy , you gotta talk to me first . I don 't know what happens . But before the seizure starts , I get , like , these visions . Like I 'm someplace else , and ... I 'm not in control , I ... Like my body is here , but my mind is someplace else . Hey , thank you . Don 't worry , we 're gonna figure this out , okay ? Claudia ? Yeah ? Excuse me . ( SIGHS ) Listen , the MRI shows massive neurological seizures . Busts of electrical activity that are 10 times stronger than any epileptic seizures . This thing 's frying his brain . Essentially , yeah , and if it keeps happening , it 's gonna kill him . Well , he 's home . I don 't think anyone 's told him yet about his wife and Spencer going to the hospital all joined up and such . Yeah , that should be fun news to deliver . Mr. Labelle , it 's Rex in security . ( KNOCKS ) Mr. Labelle , it 's the Secret Service . ( DISTANT THUD ) Mr. Labelle ... Agents Bering and Lattimer . We 're with the Secret Service . What 's this about , Rex ? We have some questions to ask you about DA Chambers . Oh , sure . Right . Common misconception , running does not make you look innocent . Today is not the day to test him . Now where 's the artifact ? The what ? Whatever you used to poison DA Chambers . Where is it ? I didn 't use anything , I swear . I just broke his windshield . Well , then why did you take a swing at me ? I panicked ! I knew you 'd think I 'd killed him . I didn 't ! You killed him , and then you went after your wife when you found out she was cheating . Leslie 's cheating on me ? How did ... With who ? Do my kids know ? You smell that ? Something 's burning . Dude , you 're on fire ! ( SCREAMING ) ( SCREAMING ) MYKA : Pete , get back ! ( SIREN WAILING ) Okay , Mykes , we gotta find this thing . With burns like those , that guy could still die . All these people are starting to panic , and we are back to square one . Labelle clearly did not know that his wife was cheating on him . So , okay , what do we know ? We got ... We got three victims from three different attacks which may or may not have come from the same artifact . Well , they all lived here at Crown Heights , so who have we met in town who might be able to tell us what 's going on ? Toodles . I 'll get us some tea . So , uh , Mrs. Molloy ... Janice . Please , it 's Janice . How long has Rex worked here ? JANICE : Um , a while . Maybe eight years . And was he , uh , especially close with either DA Chambers , or Mrs. Labelle , or Spencer ? ( MOUTH FULL ) Mykes , you got to try these cookies . No , I don 't think so . You know , Rex , he always kept to himself . Even after his condo burned down and he moved in ... His condo burned down ? As in , with fire ? Yeah , fire , about three months ago . Faulty wiring , I think . And then the board let him live in our rec room while he settles with his insurance company . Huh . Go ! Mmm . ( GIGGLING ) ( GROANS ) Oh , hey , hey . Uh , are you all right ? Back in one piece . Yeah , I 'm sorry that I left you down there . No . No problem , I managed to clean out the last filter before the , uh , nausea overwhelmed me . What about you ? Are you okay ? Oh , yeah , no , I 'm sure that the , um ... ( SNIFFS ) The ... The goo smell will leave my sinuses in a few years . ( LAUGHS ) I guess that 's karma for me trying to mooch free advice . Oh , no , the Regents brought me here to help with issues exactly like this . And , uh , I happen to know a thing or two about being alone . You know , I 'm a therapist . I don 't make a lot of friends at work . Hmm . I imagine in the regular world , once you tell people what you do , they , uh ... They wanna unload . Or they put their guards up . Which is why I quit . No , it 's not . Oh ! Oh , God , I 'm sorry . It 's something that I do , it 's ... The human lie detector . Yeah , yeah , that 's me . I meant to say it 's one of the reasons why I quit . I guess I don 't like to talk about it . You don 't have to . No , it 's good for me . I just ... You wanna sit down ? Yeah . Step into my office . So , um , two years ago , I had a patient who , uh ... I couldn 't help him . I guess I was afraid that it would happen again , so ... I quit . And went traveling . Just me and my camera . Another observational tool to hide behind . Physician know thyself , right ? So how did you end up here ? I was in Burma photographing political prisoners when I met Adwin Kosan , and he said he had a sense about me . And told me about the Warehouse . Wow . He found me in New Jersey . You know , I thought I knew things , but ... This place ... Well , I guess that 's what we have in common . We 're a bunch of lonely , misfit toys that the Warehouse collects . Except now you have each other . Maybe that 's why you 're so anxious about your things arriving . How do you mean ? Well , you said you were worried about not having someone to share your life with . Now it seems to me like you might have four special unique " someones . " And for now , they might be your " one . " And it might be time for you to share a little more of yourself with them . Which can be scary . Artie said you were good . ( CHUCKLES ) ARTIE : None of these equations seem to be solving anything . " T is not equal to S ... " What the hell ? I hate only having one clue . Is he always like this ? ( GRUMBLING ) Usually grumpier , he 's just distracted . So what is this place , anyway ? Um , it looks like it might have been an old NSA safe house . Now , they obviously use it to shoot porn . Hey , that 's Saint Jude , right ? Patron saint of lost causes . Where 'd you get this ? Um , one of my foster moms . There 's this kid at school who used to terrify me . And Mrs. L. Said that I should pray to Saint Jude if I ever had nightmares . I need one of those . Do you mind if I ... You still have nightmares ? Like a never ending sci-fi miniseries . About the psych ward . About my brother being lost . And ... More recently about this guy . He killed my friend . Whoa . What happened to him ? Ha ! You sneaky little bastards . No , no . Not you , not you . I think I got it ! Here , I need you . Sit tight . Yes , Dr. Frankenstein ? ( LAUGHS ) Yeah , one hump . Okay , so ... You , you keep seeing programming code , I keep seeing probability formula . It turns out ( LAUGHS ) Both are used by investment firms in their marketing analysis programming languages . Can I get the tweeted version ? Banks hire physicists and statisticians so they can create numerical price hedging models ... Like derivatives ? And other things . And the banks employees are called quants . Or quantitative analysts . You know what their work looks like ? Exactly like this-o-rama . Nice , so it 's no coinkydink we 're near Wall Street ? But what would Nick have to do with any of that ? Yeah , Nick ... Oh , Artie , he 's having another vision . Which means he 's gonna have another seizure , so we should be ready . Nick says that he feels as if he 's being transported to another space , right ? If there is an artifact , and if a quant is somehow using it , we have to get Nick to give us more details about where he is so that we can track the artifact . Yes . Nick , can you tell me where you are or what you see ? I see a man 's hands . Yeah , what are they doing ? What are they doing ? They 're doing what I 'm doing . Yeah . They 're mirroring his actions . What else ? Artie , he 's already seizing . The downside of the artifact , it 's intensifying . We 've have to stop this . We 've gotta keep going , we gotta save him . What else ? ( GROANING ) I 'm in an office . I see a blue mug , and some white board ... A clock with an antelope . CLAUDIA : That 's enough . Okay , okay , all right . Put him on the couch . Hold him , hold him . Got him ? I 'm trying . I 'm trying . ARTIE : All right . What is that ? Joseph Stalin 's sleep mask . It 's the only thing that would let that paranoid dictator actually sleep . ( VOICE SPEAKING RUSSIAN ) All right , so there 's gotta be some connection between Rex and the other victims . Well , maybe they all stumbled onto some secret , and now they 're paying the price for it . Mykes , doesn 't it seem kind of weirdly lucky that the fire didn 't touch any of his expensive electronics ? Janice did say that Rex was waiting for a settlement from his insurance company , right ? Yeah , well he should have had his testosterone checked , because this weight is nothing . ( GROANS ) Pete , this is a notice of a secondary arson investigation . It says that they found traces of boric acid in his power outlets . Boric acid ... Boric acid , it burns green . I saw it on Bill Nye , the Science Guy . Rex burned the same color . So this is a cause and effect artifact . Yeah , he torched his place and went up in flames with it . Mrs. Labelle and Spencer were boinking , right ? And now they 're conjoined . One was an arsonist , the other two adulterers , all being punished with their own sins . Yeah , but what about DA Chambers ? It was his job to put people away . Unless he did something unethical during a murder case which resulted in a lethal injection . So we need to start telling Steve to research sin-related artifacts ? Yeah , and we need to figure out who in this town is so obsessed with morality that ... Colonel Cassel ! What ? Colonel Cassel . Remember ? " Rules are rules , soldiers . " And once you start breakin ' ' em , it 's a slippery slope to hell . " Right . It was kind of a Burgess Meredith thing . MYKA : It was very weird . PETE : I don 't know . His cart is here , but he won 't answer . Colonel Cassel ? Colonel Cassel ? ( COUGHS ) ( COUGHING ) I got this . You call 911 ! Yes , we 're at 106 Woodpecker Crescent ! ( COUGHING ) Yes , at Crown ... In Crown Heights ! Yes , thank you . Colonel ! How is this happening ? How is what happening ? Somebody knows . That 's why they 're doing this to me ! Somebody knows what ? Did you do something illegal or immoral in your past ? Something ... What ? No ! No ! Colonel , you need to tell us , okay ? There could be a connection . Okay , all right . It was Kuwait . ' 91 . Our unit was stranded in a village . We were outnumbered four-to-one . We knew where the enemy was . The locals were harboring them . They had whole stockpiles of gas . We had no choice . We gassed the whole village . Killed ' em all in their sleep . Women . Children . God forgive me ! We should have died that morning . Instead , we got Liberation of Kuwait medals . Listen to me , okay . Listen to me , okay . When you said , " Somebody knows , " did you mean somebody here , in Crown Heights ? ( SIREN WAILING ) I don 't know . Okay , just lie back and relax . Someone 's here to help you . Just try and breathe . Mykes , someone here is doing this . Well be better find out who before we have a mass exodus and we lose this artifact for good . CLAUDIA : How is he ? Well , heart rate 's low , blood pressure 's high . I 'm getting erratic brain activity . I don 't think he 's gonna survive another seizure . We can 't let this kid die , Jinksy . So you think this artifact is tethering him to a quant somewhere and doing this math ? Yes , his mind seems to be going wherever the quant is . He described an office . You think this quant is nearby ? Or is he affecting Nick at a distance ? Well , he theoretically could be anywhere . These psychic artifacts , they can work from afar . The broach that Queen Isabella gave Columbus , that could make you brave from across an ocean . Well , we 're hoping the quant is closer , obviously . Nick said he saw a clock with an antelope so I 've been cross-checking with New York investment houses . Yeah , but why would a quant want to be tied to a boy who barely knows math ? Wait , wait , you said that quants analyze a vast amount of data and apply them to numerical models , right ? Yeah , all firms use them . Well , that would take a huge amount of mental capacity . You see , young brains are still developing , and so they 're more flexible , and they have the ability to make more connections than adult brains . So you 're saying that someone is using Nick 's young brain power to help them do their work ? Like a hacker borrowing a server ... Not that I 've ever done that . Okay , what about Sir Isaac Newton 's cravat ? Gives the wearer insight if you wipe it across your forehead . The downside , it increases your gravitational pull until you can 't move . Does not create a psychic link . I got it . Four Wall Street banks have logos with horns , only one has an antelope . Armstrong Investing . That 's it . That 's what I saw . ( FARNSWORTH RINGING ) Guys , that 's Pete and Myka . We 'll keep looking . Why do I suddenly want vodka ? Oh , yeah , that 's just the downside of the sleeping mask . It 'll be gone in 30 seconds . But now I want vodka . So the tight ass we thought had the artifact turns out to be a gas spewing chimney from Mars . Okay , uh , we started with sin-related , and ended up at biblical artifacts , and the closest we got to , uh , divine punishment was an obscure version of the Sodom and Gomorrah story . It says that when Sodom was razed for its sins , a windstorm buried it in the salt dunes that made it so wealthy . Yeah , apparently Warehouse 3 agents feared that a handful of artifacts may have been created that day as salt-covered objects and took their shape . STEVE : But it didn 't say what those objects were . But why is someone targeting these specific people ? I mean , is it just because they live here ? Or because they sinned ? Everybody sins , there has to be another connection . I got it . What ? Mykes , look . It 's because they 're all Crown Heights board members . DA Chambers , Mrs. Labelle , Colonel Cassel . So maybe a disgruntled resident is targeting board members ? Yes , but why ? And Rex the security guard is not on this list . There , we can read all about it . Steve , keep digging on the artifact . I 'm gonna go check out this last board member , Mr. John Foster . Pete , just be careful . And did you hear from Steve ? No , but I did find an article crediting Armstrong 's algorithmic trading quantitative analysts for their recent success , ATQ . Got it . So maybe there 's a section ... Uh-oh , Artie . Oh , no ! It 's happening again . I 'm gonna need specific directions . This place is huge . Nick , Nick , can you hear me ? Can you tell me what you see ? I 'm in the same office as before . I need more . Something specific ? Door with frosted glass and a desk in front of it . Frosted glass and desks ... They 've all got frosted glass and desks ! Nick , what else ? ( GROANS ) I know you can do this , come on ! I hear that song from the " kill the wabbit " cartoon . I don 't know , he keeps hearing , " Kill the wabbit . " " Kill the wabbit " ? " Kill the wabbit . " ( DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING ) Oh , kill the wabbit ! Okay , all right , I gotcha . Of course , Orville Wright 's aviator goggles . Take them off ! Artie , come on ! QUANT : Why ? Because if I 'm right , they belong to the less-talented of the Wright Brothers who imbued them with the ability to steal other peoples ' brain power . Never mind ! You 're killing a young boy by wearing them . ( GRUNTING ) Come on , Artie ! You okay ? Yeah . ( SIGHS ) Okay . Artie , you did it . I don 't know what you did , but it worked . Nick 's okay . Okay . ( IN SPANISH ACCENT ) Lucy , you got some ' splainin ' to do . ( GRUNTS ) Well , that was way more testosterone-y than picking a lock . John Foster ? PETE ON PHONE : Hey , Mykes . I think I know who has the artifact . Last week , the board rejected for the third time a petition from Janice Molloy . She wanted to erect a bust of her late husband , the founder of Crown Heights . What about Rex ? Rex spoke out against the bust , saying that it would , " Tempt vandals for no good reason . " So Janice is doing this whole thing over a bust ? You said it , right ? Twisted priorities , but you know , we still don 't know how she did it . PETE : She might be doing it to John Foster right now . Oh , my God , her chocolate cookies . What , whose cookies ? Janice 's ? STEVE : When Sodom was razed for its sins , it was buried by a windstorm in the salt dunes that made it so wealthy . The salt , Pete . I know ! That 's what made ' em so good . Pete , what if the handful of artifacts that were created by the windstorm weren 't the objects that the salt covered , but the salt itself ? What if it 's imbued with some sort of power ? The salt from Janice 's cookies ? Whoa , that would ( SHOUTING ) suck ! ( SCREAMING ) ( GROANING IN PAIN ) Oh , my God ! MYKA : Pete ! Pete . ( CONTINUES GROANING ) Pete , don 't move ! Okay ? Okay , I won 't ! 'Cause I don 't think I can . I think my legs are broken . Myka , go get Janice and bag the artifact . Go ! Okay . ( MAN CHUCKLES ) Yeah , they look good . I could lose a little weight here , but , uh ... They look good . Thank you very much . Don 't eat that ! Hey ! What the ... Trust me . I know what you 've been doing ! Oh , my God , the salt . The salt covered a person 's face and took its shape . ( WHIMPERS ) Shut up ! That 's what you 've been using to hurt people , isn 't it ? All for what , Janice , what ? A bust ? No , it 's my husband . He built Crown Heights ! Get back ! Our whole marriage is about this place , down to naming the streets after our favorite birds ! He loved Crown Heights ! He gave his life too , and they ... They want to wipe him ! They want to wipe him out ! Ahhh ! ( SOBBING ) Give me the mask ! ( JANICE SCREAMS ) Just save it , Janice . ( GROANS ) It 's getting worse ! Look , I bagged it , all right ? Oh , my God . Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Why isn 't it working ? Okay , listen , we just have to , just , uh ... Colonel Cassel , what happened ? They sent me home . As soon as I left you , I started feeling ... Good Lord ! Is he all right ? No , just go and please call an ambulance ! Pete ... So we just have to figure out what happened when he left us , okay ? What did we do ? He ... We gassed the whole village . We killed ' em all in their sleep . Women . Children . Forgive me ! We made him confess , right ? Pete ! Listen to me , I think that you have to confess , okay ? I think I 'm just gonna wait till the ambulance comes . You can 't wait for the ambulance , okay ? The only thing that will work is a confession , all right ? Whatever it is , just trust me . Tell me . Okay ? I 'm ... I 'm your partner . Just talk to me . Okay . Okay . It was when I was still drinking , and ... ( SOBBING ) I was ... I was young , and I was ... I was cocky and I was stupid , Myka . And I was drunk , man . I was drunk . I got behind the wheel . I was ... I was such an idiot . I don 't know what ... I lost control of the car . I hit a tree , but I walked away . I walked away , not a ... Not a damn scratch . But my buddy , Dave , he ... He got ... He got thrown from the car ... He broke both his legs . And I did that . I did that . I 'm responsible for that . Sorry . I 'm sorry . I ... That was rock bottom for me . I swore I 'd never take another drink , and I haven 't , Myka . I haven 't taken any . I know . I know . Pete , I think it 's working . I could have killed my friend . I 've never been able to forgive myself . Just listen to me , okay ? You have come so far since then . Okay ? You are a completely different person now . It took real guts to tell me that . I think you 've got all the testosterone that you need . You think so ? I do . So no more seizures ? No , Artie caught the guy who was doing this to you . We think maybe you ran into him panhandling or something , so ... No more seizures , no more visions . Huh ? Yeah ! Okay ! Uh , thanks . I mean , you 're awesome . I mean , you saved my life , so , you know , I owe you . No , come on , it 's my job . So can I go now ? Yeah , I mean , I guess . You 're not gonna call Social Services ... Well , like you said , we don 't really do that , and I would never do that . But where are you gonna go ? I don 't know , I 'll figure it out . Wait , it 's just that ... ( SIGHS ) Why don 't you come back to South Dakota with us ? South Dakota ? Why would I do that ? Just for a couple days . So we can monitor whatever the residual effects of this might be , and then when we 're done , we 'll fly you back to wherever you wanna go to start over . I don 't know . It sounds like a trap to put me in foster care someplace really far where I can 't run away . That 's a good idea , but no . And I think I 've earned a little trust at this point , haven 't I ? Look , Nick , I know the worst part about where you are right now is that feeling that nobody cares . So why don 't you let me pay forward what was done for me , huh ? Yeah , I guess we can give that a shot . Yeah ? Great , it 'll be fun . You 'll like it . ( BELL DINGS ) What 's that ? Oh , this is , uh ... One of my photographs . I thought I 'd share it with everyone . Taking your own advice . Well done . ( DOOR OPENS ) PETE : Hello ? Hey ! Abigail , hey ! Hi , welcome home ! So , uh , we heard you had to flush out the Gooery . That 's a bummer , huh ? Did it barf on you ? Because I cried when it barfed on me . She did . Actually , it barfed on Steve . Ooh . ( SNIFFS ) What ? What is that wonderful smell ? ARTIE : Hello ? PETE : Hey ! Hey , guys ! Hi . Hi . Welcome back . Oh , hi . Nice welcoming party . How is everybody ? What 's going on ? We just got home too . Oh ! Pete , Myka , Abigail ? This is Nick . Nick , hey , how 's it going , man ? Hi . This is a lot of people . Nick is just between places right now , so I convinced Artie to let him stay for a couple days . After all , this is a BB , and where is my Steve ? And what is that wonderful smell ? I know , right ? That is Steve . He is cooking . What ? I knew he could cook . Score ! The man is full of surprises ! Come on , I 'll show you your room . So , how was Ohio ? Oh , you know , it was ... You know , the usual . Snag , bag , tag ... ( WHISTLES QUIETLY ) Oh , good . And , whoa ... What is that ? ABIGAIL : I took that photo while I was traveling . Beautiful . Look at you with the hidden talent . Yeah , I was just gonna put it upstairs . ( ALL PROTESTING ) MYKA : Leave it . PETE : It 's cool . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Oh ! Lasagna ? ( ALL EXCLAIMING EXCITEDLY ) Lasagna ? Lasagna ? Could I have some ? PETE : Hey , so Steve-o , how 'd your physical go ? STEVE : It turns out , I am gay . PETE : Mykes , when 's your physical ? That 's good . Don 't eat it all ! CLAUDIA : Mine 's coming up this week . STEVE : There 's lots . There 's lots , Artie , plenty . ( ALL CHATTERING ) WOMAN : The doctor will see you now , Ms. Bering . DOCTOR : ( FAINTLY ) The results , I 'm afraid they 're not what we hoped they would be . ( MUFFLED ) I 'm gonna have you come back so we can run a few tests , but in my experience ... Myka ? Myka ? Did you hear what I said ? I said we could be looking at ovarian cancer . I think we should discuss treatment options , Myka .

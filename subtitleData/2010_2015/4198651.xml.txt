 Obviously , I miscalculated a few things . Eddie I know you 're in there , Why is it that , the moment your life exceeds your wildest dreams ... " The Knife " appears in your back . Well , I 'll tell you one thing ... I will never let them touch me . My neighbor , must have opened his door to complain . For a guy with a 4 digit IQ , I must have missed something ... And I hadn 't missed much . I 'd come this close to having an impact in the world . And now , the only thing I had an impact on ... was the sidewalk . You see that guy ? That was me , Not so long ago . What kind of guy , without a drug or alcohol problem looks this way ? Only a writer . strangely enough , nobody believed that I actually had a book contract . Well it 's best rated as a sci-fi novel ... but it 's really uh , my own personal manifesto about the plight of the individual in the 21 century . and I sort a created a Utopian society , where , we all sort of uh uh uh ... It 's really ... It , it 's really , it 's re - uh . Today was the day , I was gonna kick its ass Here we go . Here we go . Here we go . Here we go Man , It 's gonna be great . Just gotta put in the time and stay in the room . That 's the key concept . Don 't leave the room ! A few weeks passed this way Maybe a few months . At least I still had Lindi . Just like that ? Come on , Eddie ... This is hardly a surprise . I , I 'm surprised ? Let 's just not do this . I am gonna hand in 90 pages tomorrow on Friday You just wait to see what she says . - Eddie ! - What ? I know how it 's going . I am , I was , your girlfriend . That word doesn 't even begin to describe what you are to me . Partner ? Squeeze ? Paramour . Inamorata Cleaning Lady . Bank . Well be there that .. Well what 's mine is yours too . and you know that I want to share the rest of my life with you . - In fact , I was thinking ... - that we should probab ... - Don 't propose . Why not ? Because it worked out so well for you last time . it 's true , I did marry once , right out of college - to melissa .. I do ! briefly . This isn 't working . Well , even though everything you said is true , I still love you . I gotta get back to work . You didn 't even tell me what happened . - I got it ! - You did ? I 'm an Editor . I have my own assistant . You believe that ? Yeah , Of course I believe you . You deserve it . Thanks . She was right . Why stick it out ? I had clearly missed the on-ramp . We both knew what was beckoning . The lower bunk of my childhood bedroom in Jersey . My Father happy to welcome me into the challenging field of dental supply inventory . Eddy Morra ! Of all the useless relationships better forgotten and put away in mothballs Is there any more useless than , the ex-brother in law ? Holy Shit , man ! How 's it been , like Nine years ? - God ! - Hey ! You alright ? You look like you 're livin ' on the streets . What 's going on ? Not much . Uh , I just broke up ... What am I , what 's up uh , I 'm writing ... Writing a lot Oh , you still trying to write ? Matter of fact , I have a book contract - Really ? - Yeah . - That 's great . how about you ? Are you uh ... You still dealing ? - Do I look like I am still dealing ? - No , you don 't . No . Come on , let 's get a drink I wanna hear about this book . I don 't know , it 's two o 'clock in the afternoon . When has that ever stopped you ? So . - So ... - How is Melissa doing ? - Here . - Thanks . Wouldn 't know , I don 't see you her . She moved upstate . She got some kind of Internet , home-sales kinda job . Couple of kids . Couple of kids ... Who 's the husband ? He walked out on her , if you really wanna know . But what do you care , man ? You were married for like five minutes . Look , I don 't wanna talk about her . I want to talk about you . Okay ? Tell me about this book . How 's it going ? Well it 's a ... I 'm behind . I 'm behind on my book , and uh , It 's pretty booked ... including my days and nights , if you really want to know . - Well , how much have you written on it ? - Not one word . - Creative problems , um ? - Yeah . Well I suppose , I can help you with that . Just this once . Oh , No , no , no ... You don 't even know what it is . - You 're still dealing . - Brother , I am light-years from that now . I 've been doing some consulting for a pharmaceutical company . What , like some off-shore lab making fake Viagra ? Come on Vern . No . This is an exclusive product , that 's coming on the stream next year . They 've had clinical tries , and it 's F.D.A. approved . Alright , just out of curiosity and that 's all ... Let me see it . What 's in it ? They 've identified these , receptors in the brain that activate specific circuits . And you know how they say that we can access only 20 % of our brain ? Well what this does , it lets you access all of it . Vernon , look at me . Do I look good to you ? I 'm broke and I 'm depressed off my ass . I don 't think that my life 's gonna take some sudden upswing into fame and fortune , by taking some shiny brain exotic drug . Get . When ? Tell him we can 't do that . No . You tell em . No . Now ! Well , I 'm afraid I 'm gonna have to leave you here Eddie . But I really , I really do wanna do this again . So , call me . And , that 's on the house . I don 't want it . Do not be ungrateful . You know how much that costs ? Eight hundred bucks ... A pop . You 're welcome . All the way home , I thought about Melissa . How could she be a failure too ? . She 'd been so smart . Smarter than anyone around her Clearly , there was a direct link between this Eddie ... Slightly drunk at three o 'clock in the afternoon , and an earlier Eddie . vomiting on his boss ' desk ... or stealing his dying aunts Percocet . So who can blame Lindie for dumping me ? In the end , how much worse could it get ? I didn 't want to see anybody . Especially not my landlord 's nasty young wife - Valerie , Tuesday ... - Look ! Enough ! Okay ... Steve handles the rent , so you can feed your crap to him ! I suddenly had extra reason to get away from her . I had thoughtlessly ingested a substance . Like the rent 's not low enough ! I had gotten remarkably little information from Vernon about what this drug would do . you can even be a biker messenger and come up with that . Really ! What if it was a hallucinogen ? . It 's pathetic ! Oh my God ! Listening to her rag - If I were tripping , I 'd jump out a window Hello ! Are you listening to me ? Do you get it ? You are gonna be out on the streets ! And then I felt it . I was blind , but now I see . - What 's wrong ? - What ? You don 't like me and I don 't blame you . You see a self defeating , energy sucking , piece of shit who 's sponging off your husband ... you 're wishing I 'd blow my brains out ... but my existence shouldn 't make you this upset - What is it ? - That 's none of your business ! Something wrong in Law school ? How do you know I am in law school ? People who aren 't , usually don 't carry around dry .. academically constipated books about a dead supreme court justice . You are a creep aren 't you ? You 've been following me . No , I just noticed the book . You just saw the corner of it . How did you know that ? I 'd seen it before . 12 years ago in college . sitting on the couch with a T.A. I was trying to make ... waiting for her coming back out of the bathroom , hoping she 'd have a condom . Somehow , my unconscious had served that up . A memory I 'd never even recorded ... or was there the whole time and I all I need was the access ? If you 're writing a paper , that 's not the book I 'd use . Who asked you ? Hastings has it 's own history . I 'd start there . Interesting point ... Grammatically , this guy was an idiot which sort of gives credence to the theory that one of the clerks , he had fired .. actually wrote most of this guy 's major opinions . you 'd ruler the clerks sons ... They 'd love to talk to you ; exonerate their dad . that 'd give you something that no one else has ... information from the odd museum show ... a half read article , some PBS documentary ... was all bubbling up in my frontal lobes , mixing itself together into a sparkling cocktail of useful information . She didn 't have a chance . What , what , what are your suggestions ? We 'd really worked on her paper too . In 45 minutes , it was a polished gem . She was pleased . Home ... but it couldn 't be my home , could it ! ? and who would live like this ? My first thought ... Torch it ! . But , saner heads prevailed . What was this drug ? I couldn 't stay messy on it I hadn 't had a cigarette in 6 hours ; hadn 't eaten ... So , I 'm steamiest and tidy . What was this ? A drug for people , who wanted to be more anal retentive ? I wasn 't high , wasn 't wired ... Just clear . I knew what I needed to do , and how to do it The next morning , I sent a little probe down into my brain . No surge of brilliance came up to greet me . In short , I was back . But something remained - You 're kidding ? ! - No - Words have appeared on paper . - Yes . - Written by you ? - All you have to do , is to read 3 pages Just read 3 Pages in the next hour . and , if you don 't want to keep reading , I 'll give you back the advance . - Okay , Eddie . - Okay Eddie , give me a call , when you get in . Eddie , I am 40 pages further in . call me . It 's , a little grandiose but I am still reading . Okay , how did you do this ? I really ... Call me the minute , you get in . Call ! Okay ? - Who is it ? - Hey , Vernon , its Eddie . - Eddie who ? - Morra . not a good time , Eddie . Hey Vern , I really just need to talk to you . - Vern , what happened ? - Don 't worry about it . I 'm fine . So , Eddie , you are interested after all . That stuff 's amazing . Works better , if you 're already smart . - Vernon , who did this to you ? - Trust me , you do not want to know . - So , uh , what , what 's it called ? - Doesn 't have a street name yet . But , the boys in the kitchen , are calling it NZT-48 . The " boys " and , the " kitchen " ? Doesn 't sound very , FDA approved Vern . FDA approved . That 's a laugh . You didn 't really believe that shit . Did ya ? Okay , so what do we have here ? some unknown , untested , possibly dangerous drug scammed out of some unidentified lab somewhere . given to me by a highly unreliable guy I hadn 't seen in years - So you want some more ? - Yes . Definitely . Alright , we 'll talk about it . But I need a favor first . Obviously , I 'm in no condition to go out right now So I was wondering if you could pop down to the uh , dry cleaners ; grab my suit for me ? And maybe grab a little breakfast for us . He knew , he had me . Sure . From now on , I 'd happily be his errand boy . Wash his windows , scrub his toilets ... Anything I can do , to get my hands on this little clear pill that would bring back , enhanced Eddie . Vern ? Vern ? Vern ? Oh God . Hey ! HEY ! 911 ... What 's your emergency ? Hi , I need to report uh ... A murder ? 7B , yes . Okay , I 'll hold . It took them forever . And the longer I stood there , the clearer I saw Vern had known , whoever had done this And one guess , what they 'd been looking for But had they found it ? Shit . If you ever cooked , I 'd be dead too . Police dept ! Open the door please . Police dept ! Open the door ! Open the door please ! Police ! Open the door ! Let 's go ! Open the door ! - Let me see your hands ! - I 'm the one who called ! - I called you guys ! So you guys tight ? Hang out a lot ? No . He 's my ex-wife 's brother . I just actually met him on the street and he asked me to come up . - To buy drugs ? - No , No ! What ? - What did this guy do ? - I do not know . He was ... I heard he was an antiques dealer . - A dealer ? - Yeah uh , Antiques , um ... Like uh ... Like , Viennese kinda uh , um chairs and stuff . like , curly cue leg things . Yeah ? That is correct . An Edward Morra . He 's here . The victim 's sister . I hadn 't heard her voice in ten years . - Eddie ? - Melissa ? You were there ? um , just , just before . I had run into him on the street , and uh , yeah Oh God I wish I was more surprised , he was involved in some stuff . I better not to say anymore . No , no , that 's probably a good idea . So uh , we should probably um , meet or something , right ... No , I gotta do the funeral and God knows what else ... We can 't meet , okay ? Right . I guess I 'll just see you at the funeral then. uh ? No ! I don 't , I don 't want that . Please don 't . I call you at the point okay , when this is over Okay . Alright Okay . You know , something doesn 't gel here . Write down your number . I 'll need it to contact you later . Worth the risk ? What would you do ? Vern 's cash , combined with an unprecedented surge in motivation enabled me to finish the book in 4 days A tablet a day , and what I could do with my day , was limitless . In learned to play the piano in 3 days . Math became useful And fun ... All in . Even half listing to any language , I became fluent . So that Shakespeare 's text , it is polite mediocrity . who 'd ever argue with you ? This was great . So mom , I 've been doing a little research on aunt Helen 's tumor . And ... it 's totally clear , that anybody with Familial Adomis Phalacrosis ... should be supplementing Platinum doublet regiments ... with lico cimpenti oic acid . I suddenly knew everything ; about everything . Sure dude ! You 'd get a short term spike ... but wouldn 't that rapid expansion devalue the stock completely in two years ? No , cause there are safeguards . Against the aggressive over expansion ? There aren 't . Cause there are no safeguards in Human nature . Oh , we 're wired to overreach . look at history ... All the countries that ever ruled the world ... Portugal with his big massive navy . All they got now are salt Cod and cheap condoms . The Brits ! Now they 're just sitting in their dank little isle and fussing over their suits . No-one stopping and thinking ... Hey ! We 're doing pretty well . We got France . We got Poland . We got a big Swiss bank account You know what ... Let 's not invade Russia in the winter . Let 's go home . Let 's pop a beer . Let 's live off the interest . Yeah . My brain was just pouring this stuff out . Everything I 'd ever read , heard , seen was now organized and available here it is , here you go Eddie ! Hey ... Listen , I 'm sure you have a portfolio but if don 't ... I 'd be very interested working with you . Okay , Kevin . I made some new friends who invited me to the beach . The beach , was not nearby . All my fear , all my shyness , gone ! But mere lounging wasn 't enough . only problem , if I wasn 't moving forward I felt like I was going to explode - Anybody ever jumped ? - Are you crazy ? - He is gonna do it . - He 's not gonna do it . Oh my God ! And then I began to form , an idea . Suddenly , I knew exactly what I needed do . It wasn 't writing . It wasn 't books . It was much bigger than that But it will take money to get there . In a down market , no-one was making much . But , no one had NZT . Armed Vern 's last 800 Dollars , I made $ 2,000 in a day . Next day , 7500 It was too slow I 'd need more capital . Banks weren 't lending to guys like me . That 's him in the corner back there . So , uh ... Liv told you that , I 'm looking for a short-term loan ? Yeah , and I told them that - forget it . Why ? Because I don 't see you before , and I don 't like you already Why do I give you $ 100,000 Dollars ? Because ... I quintupled my money 4 days in a row . - So you got a fix on the game ? - No , not a fix . I was able to calculate certain patterns in the algorithms . If you look at column 4 , This was the first ... You 're good . Okay , its a fix . Yea , and all you people get caught . What are you gonna do then ? Well it 's not as I if have a black book with your name in it ... If that 's what you 're talking about . ... and besides , I get the strong feeling ... that , you 're not somebody I want to disappoint . Don 't get up . I said don 't get up . Sit down ! Okay . Okay , you take this , you 're mine . - okay - You understand ? you don 't pay ... You know what we do ? I cut you at waist . peel your skin up over your head and tie a knot in it You don 't die from this , You suffocate Good luck . My new friend , Kevin Doyle , showed me how you can leverage . two and a half times your cash at day trading firm I 've been upping the dose for over a week . It seemed to cut my learning curve . Hey , Why you buying that ? The CEO was just indicted But not for the big fat defensive contract he bribed his way into That 's still on should be announced next week I was jacked in , booted up . At the end of week , My brokerage account . contained over two million dollars . word , quickly got out . You have 19 messages . four job offers , My bank raising my line of credit a reporter from the New York Post ... Really call me back Mr. Morra . No one makes money that fast This Article 's gonna get written - with or without you . And finally , Kevin Doyle , trying to sound casual . Eddie , I was talking you up to my boss and well , the impossible happened bud . But we got you a meeting with Karl van Loon . Karl van Loon wants to meet you ? apparently so . But you are not in the finance game ? What can you do for Karl van Loon ? Since when do you speak Italian ? Self improvement month . I guess uh , somebody gave me a wakeup call . - I hope you didn 't do it for me . - No , I just wanted to apologize to you . And that you know , that apparently , my capacity for self-sabotage wasn 't boundless after all . The real question is ... Why did you ever put up with me ? I was in love with you . - So when does the book come out ? - Next year . How 's your new assistant ? She 's Good . You know , I 'm really happy you 're here with me . I 'm proud of you . And ... a little intimidated . We started up again her place . my place . basically everyplace . " In a sizzling 3 days of trading , the unknown Mr. Morra " " trumped the market , prompting one top hedge fund manger to comment : " " He 's Houdini . He 's a prophet of our times . " Okay , give me that . - He 's god ! ? - You coming over later ? I can 't . I don 't have a key . Oh that 's right . Can I have it back ? - No - No ? I mean , does it have to be that key ? Can it be a new key ? to our place ? It 'll be cost-effective . And you say I am not practical . Can I walk you to work ? What you doin , hon ? Nothing . You should sleep . Isn 't your Van Loon meeting tomorrow ? Eddie ? Are you okay ? What are you doing out here ? When 's the last time you ate something ? Here he is . Nice Article in the post buddy . He is on his way . Now be warned , he 's mercurial . One minute your best friend , the next , you 're a leper . And he needs direct answers . Anything tentative , and you 've lost him forever . I think we should rehearse a few scenarios . I am eating , Kevin . Hey ! Are you up for this ? You sure ? Because I got a little bit on the line here . Have a toast plate . Hey , Karl . Good to see you . How are ya ? So , Eddie Morra , What 's your secret ? Medication . I 'm on a special medication . okay . There 's a formula with a complex method - but of course , research was a component ; massive research I knew every helix of every scrap of DNA in every company I bought . Papers stacked like the Himalayas in my office . And you know what ? - The stocks went up . - by a hair . Sure , the stocks rose , but who wants to do all that work , for a shitty little uptake ? It 's not the visceral kind of spike you want in short-time holding . So ... I dispensed with all the hard statics and I went right to the rumor mill So your bought your stocks based on what the tom-toms beating in the street ? Sure . The share prices aren 't really based on how a company works it 's about how mass psychology works So , if I found certain algorithms in the perception of the stock ... Pattern recognition . That 's your cycle help ? Well , not everybody understands the patterns . and that gave me a little bit more of an uptake , but it 's just a parlor trick . so then I went to door number 3 You 're really implying that you 've , some sort of ultimate formula ? Well , from 12,000 to 2.3 million in ten days . I do have a formula , Mr. Pierce . delusions of grandeur I don 't have delusions of grandeur I have an actual recipe for grandeur . I do not know who you are Eddie , or what your game is , But I 'm sure of one thing , you don 't work in my world . I 'm up to my ass with investment guys ... and you don 't have the half terrified , half cocky line of crap ; which is , not to say , that I like yours any better , but you obviously pick your stocks in a way that I haven 't seen before . Take a look at these companies and tell me what you think . - Right now ? - Yeah . Take your time . Sure . These companies aren 't the question , are they ? Explain . Unless you 're playing both sides of the fence . control the whole power enchilada ... But no , these companies wouldn 't get you there in a merging markets You would have ... Oh whoa ! Whoa , this must be some , big-ass merger you 're contemplating And there 's really only one company with enough bling to justify a merger with Van Loon and associations . Who 've you been talking to ? Oh , I am just connecting the dots . Is Hank Atwood really gonna go for it ? Well you 're an amazing con artist , or you 're a very smart young man ... I mean , come on ! The two of you together ... The whole world will have to come begging for energy like Oliver Twist and his bowl of Gruel . Well now you 're going backwards . What else you got ? A prediction . - It won 't come off . - Why 's that ? - You 'd have to back off Libya Really ? But , you don 't want hear this from some schmuck who needs a ride home . Alright . You get your shot . Meet me tomorrow at the Saint Regis at 10 and tell me how the gutsy little schmuck who needs a ride home , would restructure these deals . - And you better be prepared . - I am at your disposal . You don 't really live here , do you ? Well , um Spart 's weren 't big on amenities . Yea , and they eventually got their asses kicked . I didn 't go in . I wanted to walk , move , digest , ingest There are moments in life moments , when you know , you 've crossed a bridge . Your old life is over . Van Loon was my bridge . I finally had my shot . Wall Street would provide my nest egg . but then how far could I go ? CEO ? A global force ? Maybe president . time , somebody shook up the free world and got the things done . Suddenly , there was another skip . How have I gone the last 20 blocks ? I got another 10 blocks ... and then ... I was way up town . Hey ! Watch it ! a fight ? I don 't know how to fight . or do I ? if your assailants do not stop , your insistence will distract the attacker . off balancing your opponent , can make use of his momentum What bar was this ? When it finally stopped I couldn 't account for the last 18 hours in my life Hey , it 's me . I thought you were coming over . Is everything okay ? Call me when you get this . Even off NZT , I decided to give Van Loon 's files a shot . they were hieroglyphs . - Hello ? - Kevin , it 's Eddie . Eddie ? Listen , I can 't - I can 't make the meeting today . What are you talking about ? I can 't come in today . I 'm sick . Yeah ? Well , you can 't have the flu right now . He 'll never give you this chance again . I know . Listen . I just , ah ... I have all this data to analyze . What have you been doing for the last day ? Don 't you get it ? This is your test . Yeah . Well , I can 't pass the test right now . And how am I gonna look if you don 't ? - I know . Listen ... - Sh ! Listen to me . Pull yourself together - get down to the meeting Okay . Okay . I , I , I , I 'll be there . I 'll be there . - Hey . How are you , Eddie ? - Good to see you again . Sit down . - What do you know about Hank Atwood ? - Atwood ... Atwood ... Um , He 's an iconoclast ... uhm ... He owns about a half of Colorado ... So , this is " prepared " ? Eddie . What is this , Atwood 101 ? I mean ... Doesn 't everybody know about Atwood ? Where was he two years ago ? Hm ? Nowhere . Two years ago , he wasn 't even on Forbes radar . That was a great leap forward . Right ? I 'm baffled by this guy ... Comes out of nowhere , so strong ... Has me on the run , before I could even get to anybody in his camp . beats me out of two properties , investment companies up north ... We 're here in the front of the hotel where a woman ... identified as Maria Winberg , was found dead in her room last night . a victim of foul play .. Miss Winberg was a well known socialite ... but was also known for her dedicated charity work around the city . Police spent hours , questioning hotel staff and patrons . and an eye witness reported seeing a man leaving the scene . How can we convince him that I can raise his game ? Got any ideas ? What do you think ? Hm ? You 're not one of those kind of guys - are you Eddy ? we lose you , if there 's a screen in the room ? These are tectonic plates that are shifting right under us . Pardon me one second . Was it possible ? Could I have killed someone ? Was is it even me ? Eddie ? This is Melissa .. Listen ... Vernon hasn 't been giving you anything-has he ? Because that stuff is dangerous . Melissa ? Hey . Do you think we can meet somewhere ? I really need to talk to you we 're talking now . No no , let 's meet at uh , Billy 's on Grant ... At noon ? You can 't see me Eddie . Please please come . Please come . It 's important . I really need to know what you 're talking about . I realized , that there were other people , who I might now about NZT . Vern 's other clients . Yeah , Hi . May I please speak with Jerry Braden ?

NZT will do that to you .. - What do you mean ? - I mean , I took it too . - Vernon didn 't tell you any of this , did he ? - No What , when we he told me about this amazing new drug ... I was like , " down the hatch . " and it was . It was amazing . I read Brian Green 's , The Elegant Universe - in 45 minutes and I understood it . My , my work rate increased , just as insanely overnight ... and my boss started to hate me They offered me his job . And then , then I got , I got scared . Why ? Why ? Because I am not stupid . Nobody can operate at that level of mental activity and not crash . I stopped taking it . - Then ? - Then I got sick . Headaches , throwing up So I went back to , Veron ... he told me about all the people that were dying . - How much you have been taking Eddie ? - I 've been taking a lot . Well maybe ... Maybe they 've worked out the bugs maybe . Maybe this is a different batch . Yeah . - You 're off it right now , aren 't you ? - Just finish the story . Well , I didn 't take anymore and I didn 't die But after a while I realized that I couldn 't concentrate on anything for longer than 10 minutes .. I missed deadlines ... Got lazy . Slow . So slow . That was two years ago . I haven 't been the same since . You have some left ? Good . Well you go home and you take it . You take the dose down , But you don 't just stop .

No ! It 's not you You were different before . - I am still the same person . - I wasn 't when I was on it . I did things , I would never do . Those things saved your life . - But they weren 't me . - Yes . You know the way it works ... I know how it works . I get it , I totally get it . You feel invincible . Where it will take us Lin , you can 't even imagine The things we 'll be able to do Where we 'll be a year from now The kind of life that we 'll finally be able to live Well , you might have to live it without me . Look ! I am gonna stop taking it . There 's just some things I have to do to keep us safe and to , to set us up And then , I 'm gonna get off it ... I mean , that 's the plan . Look ! I have a plan . I swear I 'm gonna get off it . Okay I hope you do Looking for me ? Think you can run out on me ? uh ! You think , I don 't know where you are ? I was under the impression , our business was settled . Well I want some more of that stuff , or I shoot you right here . Take your pick . This guy was not going away . A few pills would buy me some time - Here it is . We 're done . - We will see . Until I found a more ... permanent solution . Unless you see a real threat , I never want it known that I have any security . You 'll never proceed me You 'll always follow me . never more than 15 steps behind . And never stand too close together . I wanna be able to look behind me if the opportunity presents itself . And don 't wear the same color suit . This isn 't the Matrix ! You have to know Eddie ... I wrote you off . - I was sick . - You don 't get sick You 're playing at this level - You get hit by a car , you don 't even die . - You 're absolutely right . - I know I 'm right . I mean , I didn 't know who or what I was talking to . 105 . That 's who you were talking to Carl . Delirium . Hm hm . - I sent over my revised projections . - I didn 't ask for your projections ... I know , but I think If you take a look at them ... I already have . As a matter of fact ... I fired a few people , over your projections . - I 'm sorry . - No , you 're not . You 're relieved , that you know things , my team missed . The minute , the instant , that 's no longer true ... Two months after I 'd started NZT ... I was brokering the biggest merger in corporate history . Ironically , it 's gonna be crude . Crude is gonna be where we 're gonna hit em . Which yields a projected profit of 200 % . That makes both of us very happy campers . I found that if I maintained an even dose , remembered to eat drank no alcohol ... The blackouts didn 't occur Tom is it possible to construct an imperceptible compartment ? - In this jacket ? - In all of them . Certainly , sir . Safer though my stash now was , I was not sitting around until I ran out . Well , can I combine these ingredients in the same exact quantity ? Yes . but , the exact method of delivery to the brain , uhhh ... Dart to the dart board . - Meaning ? - clinical trials , guinea pig people . that 's gonna take too long . It is was it is . Or you 'll kill people . Look . You need 12-18 months I 'll give you two million dollars If you can do it in 6 I found that we could cart the cost , 30 % . and uhm ... Excuse me for one sec I thought we straightened this out , detective . This isn 't about Vernon again , Mr. Morra . What is this about ? The witness identified the Maria Winberg suspect ... As this person . Wanna tell me your whereabouts the night of April 2nd ? I couldn 't keep this quite on my own Enter Morris Brant , the most lethal lawyer in New York . You 're lucky , somebody wiped the room . It 's weak circumstantial at best . - Just between us ... Were you there ? - I don 't remember . I don 't want to make concessions to you ... Karl van Loon 's and Hank Atwood , had no idea I might soon be charged with murder . But Ci-Corps , An-Dine and others , are jockeying for the same industrial concessions in Libya that both our companies are pretending , we 're not sniffing out . How do you know this ? The governmental bribes system is itself corrupt So of course , information about its inner-workings , like anything , can be bought . Go on . If you take a look at the lower left hand column in 2008 , five companies were jockeying for a position before we even took notice . Jesus , he looks frail . - Could be an act . - He 's not even 60 . So have you decided Eddie , whatta ya gonna do ? When this is over ? I do not know . - You haven 't given me the answer . - You haven 't you asked the question . Well , Given the scale of my contribution ... let 's say 45 Humph ! $ 45,000 ? 40 million 's plenty Eddie . There 's a lot more where that 'll come from You know , Eddie ... it may be on your mind , that you 're not gonna continue to work for me anymore ... This has been the learning experience of my life . I hope has . I hope you don 't think you 've gotten enough from me . on to the next ... Well , in order for a career to evolve , I 'm gonna have to move on . That you would even think that , would only show me how unprepared you are , to be on your own . I mean , you do know , you 're a freak ? Your deductive powers are a gift from God , or chance , or straight shot of sperm ... or whatever , or whoever the hell , wrote your life script . A gift. not earned . You do not know what I know , because you have not earned those powers . You 're careless with those powers . You flaunt them and you throw them around like a brat with his trust fund . You haven 't had to climb up all the greasy little rungs ... You haven 't been board-lined at the fundraisers ... you haven 't done the time in that first marriage , to the girl with the right father ... You think you can leap over , all in a single bound . You haven 't had to bribe or charm or threaten your way , to sit at this table . You don 't know how to assess your competition , because you haven 't competed ... Don 't make me your competition . Now I 'll open up a line of credit for you . You 'll be wanting a few toys . hotel rooms were no longer an option . What I needed , was a bunker . There 's a built in safe ... central surveillance , vault grade pneumatic doors . It 's an unparalleled three tier security system . A fortress , with a hell of a view . - What is the asking price ? - 8.5 I 'll take it . Right away , it was obvious , he was on NZT Next week , I 'm gonna need 20 pills . Next week , you can go , fuck yourself . Not that you 'll feel anything . I don 't think your fortune 500 financial friends , would appreciate the details , of your little dilemma with the police . Thursday , I 'm gonna need the pills here . Getting smarter ... Obviously , this can not go on But there is very little on this earth that 40 million dollars can 't solve and tomorrow at 9 : 00 , Atwood would sign the papers . Do you wanna call it ? - Cold feet ? - With all last night to tell us that . - Anything ? - I 'll call it again , sir . Okay , the decision could 've changed ... That makes sense - but discourtesy doesn 't . It 's still on . Oh ! Based on your charts and projections ? You know , remind me ... Who are you anyway ? I 'm sorry Karl , I 've had it with this unqualified posturing little prick . - Look ... - Since when is this the Delta quarrel ? Don ... Pull it back ! Excuse me . Mr. Van Loon , Mrs. Atwood is in your office . Ah . Mrs. Atwood , Karl van Loon , My associate , Edward Morra . Pleasure . - I wanted to make this as confidential as possible . - Of course . My husband experienced some pain and dizziness this morning . He 's currently at Lenox Hill - undergoing test . I just want you to know we have every intention of signing the contract . And as soon as he is able , we will proceed . I realize this is a useless platitude , but if there 's anything we can do ... Please don 't hesitate to tells us . Obviously , we want to be as helpful and as practical as possible , Mrs. Atwood . Thank you , gentlemen . I rely on your discretion . There wont be a proxy . a crazy prick like him giving away power of attorney ? Well , better get better . But Atwood wouldn 't get better because Atwood was out of NZT . Well , why are we surprised ? How many other meteoric rises might be explained by NZT ? At least I had some . My life wasn 't in jeopardy You wait here . only my money. and my liberty I 've been all over them . We can 't allow any disparity in race or physical type between you and the rest of the line-up . they 're as close to your clones , as I could possibly get . It 's gotta be , just one big handsome blur to this guy . Who was out there ? the woman 's husband ? the hotel maid ? Was this how , it was all going to end ? Not the dimmest clue . - He was dithering " He was the third from the right . No not him . " Here you go . A thing of beauty . You had that made ? I did . This today ... The Dow has been YO-YO-ing amid speculation , that Van-Loon Associates , and Hank Atwood have negotiated a merger ... Have you been talking to anyone ? NO . I haven 't been talking to anybody , Karl . I 'm not stupid ! I know you 're not stupid Eddie , but don 't make the classic smart person 's mistake ... thinking no-one 's smarter than you . Where the hell have you been ? This is the second time you 've turned to vapor . I was in the building . I was getting coffee ? Why ? Has there been movement ? Yeah ! There 's been movement alright . Atwood 's in a coma . He wasn 't playing us , he 's dying . What do you know about this ? I was less than usually equipped to answer . The dullness was coming on . I was overdue to take my NZT . And the pain was starting behind my eyes . Excuse me . You 're not excused . What , a man in your employ , can 't take a piss , Karl ? Was it Brant , or someone else ? The police station ? The coat room ? Mr. Morra ... Mr. Morra . Mr. Morra ! This just came for you . Alright , I 'm gonna ask you again Eddie ... What do you know about this ? - What ? About the leak ? - No ... About Atwood . What ? What about Atwood ? Look ... You got a long way to go - as a liar kiddo ... - Heck Karl , I don 't know what your .. Listen , what you about to say is bullshit ! I know there 's something you 're hiding from me . I smell it on you ! Right now , I wanna know why this deal is dead in the water ! Karl . Hey ! Eddie ! Outside Lennox Hill Hospital today , more twists and turns in the Van Loon - Atwood merger . There is absolutely . no truth to the rumor of this merger . None whatsoever ! My husband is having tests ... it 's a difficult time We would appreciate you direct , your further questions to our attorney . Ah , Yes ... We have no further comments at this time ... we 're just awaiting the results from the latest round of test , and hoping the best . Thank you ! Eddie ... I know you 're in there Eddie Eddie , come out . Come on ! Open the door . And so , here I am . I knew that they will kill me slowly and horribly . But this choice would at least be mine But we 're instinctive creatures ... We wanna live . so my foggy brain tried to remember where one tablet of NZT might be it was possible . and possible was enough . Hey , Eddie . You know , I want more , so why would you upset me ? I don 't like being down to this last one You do not even know how to use it . You don 't appreciate it . You see , I dissolve it in solution . you shoot it . It goes straight into the blood and brain . lasts much longer . So ... You tell me where the rest is ? I 'm plum out .. You know , these guys are gonna find it ... Or I gonna make you tell me Question is ... Which is gonna come first ? I guess , we gonna find out uh ? . This is a waste of my time , you know . I 'm getting out of this side of the business . I 'm branching out ... I 'm starting import export company . very exiting stuff . I got a lot on my plate , you 're lucky I am here . Back in the old times . I might peel your skin back , flay you . Flay . That 's a nice word , I didn 't know this before . I had such a poor vocabulary . But then I discovered this thing ... Google . Did you know the small and large intestines is 20 foot long ? I had no idea , I don 't believe it . I gotta see this for myself . I 'm dubious . That 's another nice word . Anyway ... I am sure you 're curious too . But don 't worry . Everything 's sterilized . We 're gonna keep you alive through the whole shebang . You 're gonna get a front row seat , baby ! not much of a triumph , was it ? because I would die here too . only NZT could help me and the last of it , was in this pug 's bloodstream . Victor ! What ? Victor . Victor ? Victor ! The police would later note , that my apartments previous owner was an arms dealer . of course these intruders , had been his dissatisfied clients and the night was still young Well , I 'm sure you 're curious to know what happened to your boss . I certainly am . I mean , if my attorney was really working for Mr. Atwood , trying to save his life ... Why is he dead ? I mean , at what point was the pony express , supposed to ride in with his life saving medication ? his boss was dead . So , I didn 't matter now . But he did not appreciate that Morris Brant had kept the pills for himself . and it was all still possible after 12 months Actually , now there 's no more tickets . Yeah , I got it . An overbooked fund-raiser ; that 's a first ! Well , here he comes . I 'll ask him . Ah ! That 's much better . Great job ! Edward ... I think we looking at a second overflow of bent . There 's a league of donations coming in , and I don 't think they 're even gonna try a second debate . Great . Hold on . There 's guy from Ivan Chemcorp 's in your office . I 've a lunch . Look ... The biggest contributor , give him his two crappy little minutes ? - Ivan Chemcorp pharmaceuticals ? - Yeah . Finally get to meet the guys that keeps the lights on . - Karl ? - Mr. Morra . what a surprise ! They told me somebody from Ivan was coming across ... Yes , thats me now . I am moving out of the energy business . Come on ! That 's like Hefner moving out of the mansion . I bought Ivan several months ago . I 'm surprised you didn 't hear . No . No . Well , I know they keep me hoppin ' here . Well , it 's gonna pay off Senator Morra . The Senate , well who knows ? Everything 's a technicality from here on . Isn 't it , Eddie ? I think we both know where it 's headed , if you can , maintain . Have you asked yourself , what you 're gonna do , when you run out ? - When did you know ? - Does it matter ? I know now . I wish you 'd come to me at first , Eddie . I could have bought Ivan at 33 a share . We could have been partners . So Ivan makes NZT . We it 'll never officially exist . Obviously , I don 't need to point out the advantages for you .. Oh I think maybe you do . Limitless supply . We know you can 't get anymore . You sure about that ? I shut down your lab this morning . Eddie , I just wanna help you . That 's all . Keep your supply . No disruption in service . Give you piece of mind . That 's all . And in return ... I do what ? Give a little advice maybe . I won 't be bothering much at first . And later ... What are gonna be bothering me with ? Well , given where you 're heading ... Some of our ideas are a bit ambitious . But hey ! I think they 're achievable . And what if I don 't like your ideas ? Well then we 'll say ... " God-speed . " and your candle will have shed a brief but lovely light . But you know what Eddie , let 's not even go there right now . Right now , I just want to keep you brilliant and healthy . Let 's go get some lunch . After you , Senator . Thanks for stopping by , Karl . Give us a second . What are you doing ? You want to be president of the United States ... or brain dead - stuck full of tubes ? I 'll take my chances . I told you ... Your chances don 't exist . We shut down your lab . You don 't you think some smart-ass and NZT might have two or three , or even four labs ? So what . You 're not making anymore . That 's right . I 'm not . I thought better of it . See once you know what 's in it , you can tweak , re-engineer ... get the bugs out . Taper off I 'm off it , Karl . Well on it , or off it , there 's no scenario where you are not working for me . How you gonna pay me ? In cigarettes ? - Last year you traded insider information 17 times . - You threating me ? Like checks from Dubai , dumping in Chile , disappeared officials When you said the spot ... You wanna go to war with me ? And trust me when I say this I am not even being creative . There 's no way you can be making accusations like that and be walking around alive . That you wouldn 't even think that shows me how unprepared your are to fight me . - You 're not longer equipped to fight me . - Do you think I didn 't learn anything ... that my synapses didn 't change , that I kept absolutely nothing ? - You have no idea , what kind of enemy I can be ... - That van 's gonna rear-end that taxi . What ? The driver 's distracted ; he 's texting ; he 's going 30mph ... He needs 60 feet stop ; he doesn 't have room to work with . I see everything , Karl . I 'm 50 moves ahead of you and everybody else . What makes you think I don 't know the guy with a beat on you right now ? How do you know you 're gonna be alive this time next year ? What are you doing ? Somethin 's pumpin ' at half-mast in there . Walls of your heart are dilated . Aorta 's not standing up . Soon you need to get that replaced . But you already knew that . You know , you should really be glad about this . Cause me working for you , you 'd end up as my bitch . Maybe we should cool off and talk again I don 't think so . Don 't forget to vote . - Edward , you good ? - Yeah ! Told you I have a lunch . - I am sorry . - Hey , don 't worry . - How 's your day going ? - I 've had better . I still can 't deal with that haircut . I don 't even recognize you on the street . Well I 'm a new man . I 've already ordered . What ?

 On the count of three , you will awaken feeling refreshed , as if Futurama had never been cancelled by idiots , then brought back by bigger idiots . One , two Professor , my fry-fro is all frizzy . - Okay . - Well , that 's all . Oh also , I 'm covered with severe burns . So ? What of it ? Well ... Why is ... those things ? You mean you don 't remember ? Nope . Nothing . It 's like I passed out in college , except no one drew magic-marker penises on my forehead . Well , I suppose it 's for the best . Considering the unbearable horrors you 've endured . Let 's never speak of it again . It all began a few days ago . We were interstellar fugitives on the run from the law . Fire all weapons and open a hailing frequency for my victory yodle . And so , as you and Leela kissed goodbye in a tender display of tonguesmanship , we plunged into a massive wormhole . Never to be seen again . Yeah , we 're back . Sweet coincidence of Port-au-Prince , we 're back at Earth ! Of course ! That was the Panama wormhole ! Earth 's central channel for shipping ! - How humorous . - Yes , it 's sort of a Comedy Central Channel . And we 're on it now ! I get it ! We 've lost power to the forward gameboy . Mario not responding ! Brace for emergency landing . Roger that . Activate safety-spheres ! Also mine has airconditioning . Yet thanks to my trusty safety-sphere , I sublibed with only trivial braindabglid . - And the others ? - Right here behind this horrorcloth . - Are they dead ? - No , no , no , no . Much worse . Subbed by : Daealis corrected by gloriabg Move over God ! Prepare for rebirth . Wrong switch . Come on stem cells , work your astounding scientific nonsense . Fetal stem cells ? Aren 't those controversial ? In your time yes , but nowadays shut up . Besides , these are adult stem cells , harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stem cells . Hermes Conrad ! O ' man , I 'm dripping with placenta . Good thing it 's casual Friday . Amy Wong ! - Ooh , baby soft ! - Indeed . Dr. Zoidberg ! Hermes , my friend ! Let me cut off your umbilical cord . And the rest ! Hooray ! We 're back in bussiness . Over my dead body . Eh , nevermind . Bender , are the stem cells working ? - I 'm dying . I need mouth-to-ass resuscitation . - I 'm on it ! It 's not working ! I die happy knowing you fell for that . His power supply is shut . He 's flatlining ! Only one thing can keep him alive . Possibly this thing . Whoo ! I 've never felt so energetic . That 's because the doomsday device I showed all up in you puts out 15 gigawatts . - That 's ten times your recommended ... - Who are you , my warranty ? For God sakes Bender , keep dancing ! Keep whooping it up ! You must burn off the doomsday energy as fast as it 's produced , or it will build to critical levels ! - You don 't mean - Oh but I do . If you stop partying for a single second , you 'll explode and kill everyone here in a fireball melted gears and splattered bones ! Sounds like a party , baby ! Oh yeah ! Hey , speaking of splattered bowels , can I cook you a romantic dinner tonight , Leela ? Where 's Leela ? Is she ok ? Why hasn 't she acknowledged my dinner offer ? Something 's wrong ! She 's not responding to my poking stick ! - Poke harder , dammit ! - I 'm poking as hard as I can ! I 'm sorry Fry , but I 'm afraid Leela is in an irreversible coma . My soulmate is gone . Why should I go on living ? Because the pain slowly fades , but the love is forever . But what if I forget the sweet sound of her voice , or the moist touch of her eyeball on my lips ? Are you still hung-up on whatshername ? Move on already ! - Maybe you 're right . - Maybe I 'm always right . Build-a-bot workshop . It 's time to start living again . At least it 's something to distract me from Leela . Nah Now that I like for some reason . - I like jelly beans . Do you ? - I sure do honey . Come now Fry , you can 't live out this sick fantasy . Not without our help . These security tapes record everything at planet express . Including the ship , shower and urinals . At yet it still hasn 't stop the illusive bathroom burglar . Maybe he 's just trying to feed his family computer , analyze tapes and and extract personality profile of one Turanga Leela . Analyzing ... Analyzing .. Checking my e-bay bid ... Dammit . Analysis complete . Hey , I was nuzling that . Attributes transferred . Shoesize 12 . Etc . Brace for an emergency landing ! What ? We survived the crash ? Oh Fry ! Party people in the house say ... This is wonderful . The last thing I remember I was dying in an explosion . Yet here I am in the flesh , more alive than ever . Alive ? - You better tell her , Fry . - Tell me what ? Anyway , my work is done . I 'm gonna hit the showers . Nibbler . Come give mama a hug . What the .. Bad Nibbler , bad Nibbler ! What 're you doing , pooperdoodle ? It 's me , Leela ! Am I really just a robot ? I mean , I have Leela 's memories , her opinion of gazelles - majestic . Her emotions - confused and hurt . I swear , I didn 't know this would happen . The only thing I truly know is I love you . I mean her . Wait , help me out here . Do the Bender , do the Bender . No thank you . - I said do it ! The truth is Fry , I still have feelings for you . But are they really my feelings ? Am I just an automaton , or can a machine have sufficient complexity , legitimately achieve consciousness ? I agree . I need some time to figure this out . Until then , friends ? Okay . Listen up disco-dummies ! You just flunked out of Bender 's College of Party knowledge . Do the backdance , do the backdance . Good news , everyone . I 'm going to make one final attempt to awaken Leela . After all , there 's always hope . - Really ? - No , don 't get your hopes up . Frankly , she 's just a brainless mound of scabs and puss . I didn 't need to hear that . No and you don 't need to see this . Wake up , wake up , wake up ... Well , that 's it . I 'm afraid traditional medicine has failed . No ! I refuse to give up ! Wake up Leela ! I ... love ... you ! Fry stop . She 's gone . Dr. Zoidberg , can you note the time and declare the patient legally dead ? Can I ? That 's my speciality ! As you all know , Leela 's living will States that in the event of coma , her body is to be fed to the wild cyclophage , a highly endangered creature that eats only cyclopses . Yup , that 's what her donor-card says . Goodbye my love . The beast approacheth . Bender cut it out . People are trying to have emotions . You think I wanna party ? I 'm sick of partying . Wohoo ! More partying ! Bender ! Shut the hell up ! Bender ! Stop shutting the hell up ! Oh , right . Leela 's back , as if I care . Woo . Alright , Leela ! Thanks . It 's so nice to wake up and see .. - Leela ! ? - Leela ? - Leela ? - Leela . How is this possible ? And can you believe she wore a tanktop to my funeral ? Shut up ! We got to get out of here ! No , you shut up we got to get out of here . All aboard the party-ship ! There 's no room for two Captain 's Butt 's in this chair . - There would be if you 'd taken a spin class instead of just lounging around in a coma ! This is crazy . It 's like I 'm looking at an exact robot duplicate of myself . That is what you 're looking at . Oh . How could you do this Fry ? Uh .. Coma .. Sad .. I have to go . This is just too freaky . Please don 't get upset , Leela . She 's nothing like you . I have to go . This is just too freaky . I need chearing up Bender . I don 't know , you want to go out and party tonight ? I hate partying ! If only I didn 't have so much cronk in my donkydonk . Why does everything I date run away ? I love Leela , always and forever , and if I loved robot-Leela too , that 's only because she had so much of the real Leela in her I thought she loved me too , but obviously I was wrong as usual . Wrong again . You were right . - Leela ? Leela-Leela ? - Leela-Leela . I 've been thinking Fry . If I lost you , I don 't think I could stand it either . I 'd probably build a copy of you too . As long as robo-Leela 's not a jealous type like me , things will I 'll kill you you slutclops ! He 's mine ! Back off , missy ! Somebody do something ! Here , take this ! A gun ? Do I really need to .. - Shoot her ! She 's the robot ! - No ! Shoot her ! She 's the human ! But how do I know who 's the human and who 's the robot ? - We just told you ! - Yeah you idiot ! Ok . Fine . If you 're gonna be like that , I 'm not shooting anyone . Right between the lungs . Man that was close . I 'm a robot too ! Aha ! That explains this growth on your driveshaft ! - But how is this possible ? - Who knows . Oh , I do . Allow me to explain what really happened the day the ship crashed . I 'll protect you Leela . My love is stronger than the vast majority of explosions . Fry did in fact save Leela , though at a terrible cost to himself . I tossed him into the stem cells , but he just bubbled away like flem on a hot sidewalk . Leela was so distraught , she went all blade runner and built a duplicate . Then uploaded Fry 's personality from the urinal surveillance tapes . I sure love Leela . Alas , in recreating Fry 's adorable jelly-belly she had overstuffed him with copperwadding . The innevitable static discharge electrocuted Leela and destroyed both of their short-term memories . So that 's why I 'm so amazed by these things I already knew . What could I do ? I hung up Leela with the other bonebags and went to procure the final ingredient for my stem cell brew . Professor , my fry-fro 's all frizzy . My God , I can 't believe I 'll never see that particular Fry again . Hey where 's my shoes ? Fry ? Oh I 'm sorry . I didn 't realise I was already here . - Wait , what 's with all the Leelas ? - Trust me , don 't ask . Ok dork . Listen , I 'm gonna hit the urinal , maybe talk about myself a little bit .. Hang on . It 's time to sort things out . - The truth is , I love Fry . That Fry . - And I love Leela . Any Leela . We 're robots and we 're in love . Let 's ditch these meatjackets . Whoa , cool ! Hasta la vista , weener . We 'll be back . For our stuff . Why did their voices change ? That 's the one thing we 'll never truly understand . - Uh , this is a bit awkward . Or is it ? - I 'm not sure . I lost track around the second robot . Well , you know how I feel . I waited for you for a thousand years , I can wait a little longer . What a load a mush ! I 've had it . - He 's gonna blow ! - Party , Bender . Party for your life ! No chance high-pants ! I 'd rather die and kill all of you than party for one more millisecond ! The cyclops-eater ! Hold on , man ! It ain 't like that ! Jeesh , what does it take to kill me ? Bender , you blew out your excess capacity ! You 're cured ! Sweet mercy ! My hellish nightmare is over ! I never have to party again . Well , that 's that then . - We 're back everyone ! - Partayh ! Best watched using Open Subtitles MKV Player

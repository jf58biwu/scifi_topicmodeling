 13 Bannerman Road is where Sarah Jane Smith lives . and it 's home to things way beyond your imagination . There 's an extraterrestrial supercomputer in the wall , her son , a genetically engineered boy genius , a schoolgirl investigator across the road , her adopted daughter from another world and a whole universe of adventure on the doorstep . Ready ? Always . Do you know anything about curses ? Native American curses ? Every one of my friends has been turning against me . Rani , we 're mates . I hate you . Get out ! I think there 's something wrong with my name ! It 's like it 's cursed ! I don 't ever want to hear his name again ! Mum , I love you . Don 't do this . I want you out of my life ! I haven 't done anything . The curse is taking everything over ! Hiya . Sleep all right ? You 'll get used to it . At least it 's dry . What was he thinking ? Kipping out in the rain ? Want to get sick ? Like things can get any worse . If you want to try pneumonia , go for it . No , look , I 'm sorry . This is all ... sort of new to me . But thanks for bringing me here . I saw you the other day . You gave me a couple of quid . Oh , outside the museum ? Sorry , I didn 't recognize you . Course not . People don 't look . Scared they might catch something . No . It 's not that . I saw them chuck you out . What did you do , unravel a bit of a mummy to blow your nose ? That 's not the only place I got thrown out . Look , if you 've had a row with your folks , go home . With any luck , you 'll be nice and warm in bed tonight . Spare us a thought . Yeah , but I 've got no-one . My mum , my friends ... they 're history . You 're the first person that hasn 't turned on me . I 'm Ellie Faber . What about you ? Enrico . Enrico ... Box . OK . What are you doing ? Having a clear-out . There 's too much clutter in this attic . But those are Clyde 's things . He should 've taken them with him . I don 't understand . What did he do to upset you so much ? Listen to me , Sky , and remember - I don 't want to hear his name again , and I don 't want you to have anything to do with him . Clear ? Yeah . Good . So how long have you been living like this ? Two years . Time doesn 't mean much here . How ? My dad died , and my mum married again . Let 's just say it didn 't work out for me . OK ? I 'm sorry . Doesn 't matter . You grow up fast out here . There 's a load of stuff that happens ... What sort of stuff ? It 's like everywhere else . There 's good people , and there 's bad ... And there 's the Night Dragon . What 's that ? Sometimes people disappear . I mean , how bad is that ? We 've already vanished once . Maybe they find somewhere to go ? And don 't tell anybody they 're going ? They 're just gone . And then the next morning people say " the Night Dragon took them " . And they never come back . School chips ... best chips in the world . The menu said there was toad in the hole . Mr Smith said there are 500 species of toad . When I asked which one we were having , the dinner lady didn 't seem very pleased . So Mr Smith gave you a basic grounding for starting school by telling you about toads , and nothing about school dinners ? Sounds just like him . I think he 's nervous of me . He doesn 't like me too close , in case I blow his circuits . He 'll get used to you . You 're one of the gang now . Like Clyde ? Don 't say that ! He was your friend ... and Sarah Jane 's . No-one can tell me why you all turned on Clyde ! I don 't feel well . I looked you up on the internet . You have a reputation for investigating strange phenomena . So I thought maybe you 'd come across something like this before . What happened ? According to our security guard , lightning burst out of the totem pole . That 's impossible . Of course ... but I 'm almost thinking there 's truth in the legend after all . But it was dead ... The myth says the medicine men trapped the god Hetocumtek in the totem pole , but warns that Hetocumtek would find a way to escape if ever the totem pole fell back into the hands of men . That 's why it was hidden in a cave in Death Valley ? Well , it 's only a legend . PHONE RINGS No ... Dr Madigan , I think it might be best to close the exhibition for a while . Just as a precaution . Of course . You got any spare change , mate ? So you do this every day ? Even in the rain ? Well , you 're hungry , I 'm hungry . It 's either this or going through the bins . Yeah , I 've done that too . Have you got any spare change , mate ? You sound like you 're flogging china down the market . Too cocky . It 's not cocky , it 's charisma . Whoever heard of a homeless person with charisma ? This is how it goes , isn 't it ? Everything you ever were , everything you ever wanted to be , it just gets worn away till there 's nothing left . The people that make it were always fighters . Survivors . I 'm one of them . You wouldn 't believe some of the things I 've done . Creatures I 've seen . Creatures ? Are you into wildlife , then ? Yeah . It was a wild life . Let 's go get something to eat . MR SMITH : Are you all right , Sarah Jane ? Yeah ... Something about that totem pole . It 's alive , Mr Smith , I saw it . Just for a moment . I know I did . There 's something terrible . It must have been dormant on your first visit to the museum . However , there are now energies building around the totem pole . But why ? That 's what worries me . That 's Max . He used to be a boxer , then he got too old . He 's been on the streets years . That woman in the duffel coat ... Polish , came over to get married . Got dumped . Can 't get home . Polly the Porsche worked in the City . Always telling everyone what she used to drive . Now she pushes everything she 's got around in an old trolley . No way . All of them , ignoring us on the street . They wouldn 't believe how easy it could be . One day it just all falls apart , and you 're here . Steven 's Point . Getting hand-outs . All right , Mags ? How 's the tea leaves ? Hello , love . This is Mystic Mags . This is my friend , Rico . If you want the lottery numbers , she 's your girl . Mock - but there 's strange things in the air . Yeah . Like fish . Something bad 's coming ! You mean the Night Dragon ? Aagh ! The dragon 's coming . I can see it in the leaves . It 's always in the leaves , before one of us is taken . But this isn 't no dragon . Something else . And it 's put its mark on you . What ? There 's a curse on you , and everyone what knows you . Cut it out , Mags . She 's right . She 's right , I 'm cursed . What are you talking about ? I 'm only ever going to get you into trouble , Ellie . Thanks for trying to help me . But you can 't , no-one can . Hey , wait ... ! Rico ... Rico , wait ! My name 's not Rico ! What ? Your name 's not really Enrico Box ? Who 'd have guessed ( ? ) It doesn 't matter . I can 't tell you my name . She was right . What , you 're cursed ? Look at ME . Welcome to the club ! Loser ! Watch it ... See ? You can 't be cursed . You 're my lucky charm . SNARLING Are you coming down with something ? No , I 'm fine . You 've not said a word since we left the shops . Come on , what 's wrong ? Rani ... Love , what is it ? I don 't know . It 's like something 's wrong ... It feels like ... I 've lost something really special , only ... I don 't know what it is . That doesn 't make any sense . I know it doesn 't . And it 's driving me mad . But I can 't shake it . It 's like ... nothing 's right any more . My whole life , Dad , it 's like ... it 's like it 's not me any more . SHE SNIFFS So , how are you settling in with Sarah Jane ? Have you met Luke yet ? He 's such a lovely boy . He was such big friends with ... Mrs Langer ... ? This keeps happening to me . Something comes into my head , and ... I don 't know what . It 's like , a part of my world has gone and ... I don 't know what it is . Is it Clyde ? Don 't use that name in my house ! Why ? I don 't understand . Everybody 's turned against him , but nobody can tell me why ! Just be glad he 's gone ! But Clyde 's your son . Don 't you love him ? I told you , don 't say that name ! It 's just a name , Mrs Langer . Clyde is your son 's name . It hurts ! Stop saying it ! That 's it ... It 's his name , his name 's doing all this ... It 's going to be all right , Mrs Langer . Somehow , I promise . GROWLING AND SNARLING THUNDER CRACKS I 've never seen so much thunder and lightning . It 's like flippin ' Transylvania . Just wetter . Why didn 't we go back to Camp Cardboard ? The streets make people superstitious . Mystic Mags will have told everyone you 're " cursed " . Well ? Well , what we need here is paper . Where were you the day of the storm ? You know the one I mean . No-one 's ever going to forget that day . I was at school . I was on the street , and then this fish drops between my feet . Splat ! It was totally random . Well , at least you had something to eat . Yeah , like I know what to do with a fish . Might as well have rained bricks . Someone said it was a weird weather thing . Yeah , I heard that , too . So , what if the fish was some sort of sign ... that something bad was coming , like Mystic Mags said ? Worse than the Night Dragon ? Yeah , really bad . I 've been through bad stuff in my life ... Maybe it doesn 't matter now . I don 't understand . For two years , I 've been telling myself I 'll get off the street . I 'll get on some sort of scheme . Get a job , get a flat . Get my life back . Meet a nice boy . That was my dream . Now it 's starting to come true . THUNDER CRACKS ROARING AND GROANING It feels like someone has died ? But you don 't know who ? It 's like someone special has been taken from you ? Yeah , that 's it . That 's exactly it . I 've been feeling it , too . What 's going on ? Something really weird . The only thing I can think is it 's something to do with the totem pole . There 's an energy in it , it 's been dormant but it 's getting stronger . Getting stronger ? ! Since when ? Oh , some time after we all went to the museum . Argh ! Since Clyde touched the totem pole ? Since he got that splinter ? Don 't say that name ! Mr Smith , I need you ! What are you doing ? ! It 's the only way I can make you listen to me ! Mr Smith , when Clyde got the splinter from the totem pole , could that have activated it 's energy ? Stop saying that ! It is conceivable . None of this makes sense , Sky . You turning your back on Clyde doesn 't make sense ! Even his mum 's thrown him out . She feels the same as you and Rani , like something 's been torn from her life , and she can 't remember what it is ! Well , it isn 't him ! I hate him ! Why , Rani ? Think about it ! You both love Clyde . You 'd never turn your backs on him . The only way this could happen is some alien messing with your heads . Clyde needs us . Stop saying that name ! Please ! Sarah Jane , your reaction to his name suggests that Sky is correct . You have been subjected to a psychophonic programming , possibly designed to keep Clyde isolated . Well , say that 's true . Why ? Because Hetocumtek needs Clyde . What if it 's found a way to escape ? The longer Clyde 's out there , the more powerful it 's getting . The legend said that if the totem pole fell back into the hands of men , then Hetocumtek would escape . The hands of men ! Clyde got a splinter ! It 's a curse and you 've got to break it ! That name . Just the sound of it , it 's agony . It hurts ! His name 's the key . His mum couldn 't say it . Maybe if you can , it will break the curse . Oh , it 's no good . You 've got to ! We 've got to find Clyde ! It 's the only way of stopping Hetocumtek escaping ! We can do this , Rani . It 's just a name . We can say it , right ? OK ... Say it ! Say it ! Come on . Clyde Langer ! Clyde Langer ! Clyde ... Clyde ... Clyde ... Clyde ! Clyde ... Clyde Langer ! Clyde ... Clyde Langer ! Clyde Langer ! BOTH : Clyde Langer ! Clyde Langer ! Oh ! Clyde Langer ! Oh ... Now the most important thing is we get Clyde back ! ROARING AND GROWLING Look . What do you think ? That 's brilliant . I thought I could do this , like a street artist . We could go to Covent Garden and people will pay to have their portraits drawn . On the back of old paper bags ? No , I 'll get a drawing pad . I 've got the pencils . I 'm telling you , Ellie , we can do this . We can get off the streets together . Stay here . I 'm going to go and get us a coffee to share . I feel like celebrating . TYRES SCREECH OK . Clyde ! Sarah Jane ! Rani ? Clyde ! SHE LAUGHS I 'm so sorry . What have I done ? We 've been looking for you all night . Thank Sky . The curse didn 't affect her . She fought so hard for you . Thank you , Sparky . Something alien is trapped in the totem pole . And somehow it 's using you to get free . If it does , we are in trouble . We need you back at the attic . I 've got to wait for someone - my friend ! There isn 't time ! We have to go ! I can 't leave her . You don 't understand . We have to go , Clyde ! We have to go . Please ! Ellie ! Oh ... Ellie ! Clyde , listen to me ! That thing could break free at any moment ! I 'm coming back . MR SMITH : Clyde . Welcome back . Sarah Jane , I have hacked into a passing Chorium trading vessel 's transmat systems . Mr Smith , do it ! Locking onto the Culture Museum . Bringing totem pole to the attic ... now . ROARING AND GROANING The psychophonic curse must be reversed . THUNDER CRACKS Do as I told you , Clyde . Now ! ROARING GETS LOUDER It 's fighting back ! THEY SCREAM What 's happening ? Clyde , you 're the only one that can stop all this ! THUNDER BOOMS You tried to ruin my life . To take away everything and everyone that was most important to me . But I 'm a survivor and you failed , you big plank . IT SNARLS My name 's Clyde Langer ! My name ... is Clyde Langer ! My name ... is CLYDE LANGER ! Team Sarah Jane ? THEY LAUGH Mum ? I love you , Clyde . She 's not here . London 's a big city , Clyde . Ellie could be anywhere . I 've got to find her . Come on , let 's try Steven 's Point . Her name 's Ellie . 16 or 17 , with a green coat . Have you seen this girl ? Have you seen Ellie ? No , sorry , mate . Have you seen this girl ? Nah . She was the only friend I had when ... when you all turned on me . And now she thinks I abandoned her like everyone else has . But I haven 't ! I won 't , not ever . I will find her . I know , Clyde . I just can 't believe , after all the things we 've seen , the most alien world of all is right here . And no-one knows . Because they don 't want to . Mate , have you seen this girl ? No , mate . All right . Thanks anyway . We can find her , can 't we ? We 've got Mr Smith . We find aliens . We help them get home , right across the universe . We can help Ellie , can 't we ? We can find her . Clyde . Look . " Ellie Faber " . It wasn 't her name . She just took it off an old poster . The Night Dragon took her . What , that was the Night Dragon ? A truck ? Comes by every so often . The drivers will sometimes give you a lift , Glasgow , Dublin , France , Germany ... they go all over the place . It 's another chance . That 's why people go . She 's gone . She meant a lot to you , didn 't she ? Come on . Let 's go home . Luke ! Oh , welcome home ! Hi , I 'm Joseph Serf . Something weird happened . He glitched . Enhancing ... I want to speak to Mr Serf , just to tell him there are no ... glitches . Call me Sarah Jane . I can 't shake your hand . So , what , he 's a hologram ? Gotcha ! What is going on ? CREATURE SNARLS SHE SCREAMS Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd Email subtitling @ bbc. co. uk

 NINA : Previously on Alphas ... ROSEN : He has your arm . It 's hard being apart from them , isn 't it ? Yeah . I never made my own friends . Are you really my friend , Anna ? Of course , I 'm your friend . They killed her . Anna . They shot her in the head . She was my friend . So you 're a fighter . You got skills ? Wouldn 't be here if I didn 't . All I know is I can do a bunch of stuff , but I can 't remember how I learned it . What did you do to me ? I 'm really sorry about your friend . Yeah , I wouldn 't call her my friend anymore , but thanks . Nina , your life is out of control . I 'm tired of hurting people . Nina , no ! I 'm sorry . For everything . ( SIREN BLARING ) ( SIGHS ) Maggie . That 's my sister . I 'm sorry for your loss . If you follow me , there 's some paperwork . ( LIGHTS BUZZING ) Adam . Don 't you hear that ? Better get you back to the main office . MAGGIE : Adam , help me . Adam ? Maggie ! Adam ! Maggie ! Adam ! Adam , help me ! Stay holding her ! Maggie ! Maggie ! Maggie ! ( GRUNTING ) Adam , help me ! Maggie ! MAGGIE : Help me ! ( GRUNTING ) Oh , my God . MAGGIE : Help me , Adam ! ( GRUNTING ) MAGGIE : Adam ! Help me , Adam ! Help me ! Adam ! Adam ? Maggie . Adam ! Maggie ! Mag ... Adam ! No , get off me ! Adam ! Get off of me ! She 's alive ! ( DOOR OPENS ) Gary 's working through some issues , he 's ... And I ... I thought it would be easier for you to find your bearings without everyone around . Plus , I wanted to find a quiet moment to speak with you about something . I know the drill . Ready to do the work , so ... No more pushing . Uh , yes and ... And no , Nina . Um , I ... I thought we 'd take a different approach to your recovery this time . I ... I need your help , but only if you 're okay with this . Um ... Let ... Let me explain , all right ? The more I learn of ... Of Stanton Parish , well , the more he frightens me . He 's made it very clear to me that should the path to his utopia be lined with bodies , so be it . An ends justify the means type of guy . Uh , yes . And Gary has managed to connect Parish 's family fortune , which is quite substantial , to a charity . It 's the Llamrei Foundation . So what , it 's like an evil charity ? No , it appears to be doing some pretty wonderful work . But it has also made some rather sizeable and yet undisclosed contributions to our own New York Senator Burton . Now , if this is a quid pro quo situation ... She probably wouldn 't admit it if you just asked nicely . Probably not . But ... I 'm thinking you could ask her nicely . I need you to find out what this senator knows about Stanton Parish . This is her schedule . She 'll be in New York for one more day . Okay . Thank you , Nina . You take your two fingers and you 're gonna put it on the seam . Then you 're gonna draw it back . Does that make sense , Ty ? TYLER : I don 't know . Gotta go . I 've got practice . Yeah , okay . Well , look , we can , uh ... We 'll work on your follow-through when you come out next week . Guess what ? I got us two tickets to the Yankees game . Mom says plans have changed . I 'm not coming to New York . PATTI : Tyler , we 've got to go . What ? Why ? Hey , Cameron , he 'll give you a call on Thursday . He 's not coming anymore ? Well , Evan offered to take us to San Francisco next weekend , so we 're gonna go to San Francisco . Well , look , I , uh ... I ... I can come out to Nevada anytime , you know ? I 'll just let you know when it 's a good time , okay ? Yeah , okay . Uh ... Tell him I said goodbye , okay ? Okay . HARKEN : Sorry about that . I wasn 't eavesdropping . I just couldn 't help but overhear . You know where I was when Tyler had his first Little League tryout ? Um ... Me neither . I was out of my mind drunk . She 's still pissed . I get it . I 'm not really in a position to make any demands after everything I put them through , you know ? Yeah . What the hell happened to you ? Present from my wife . Yeah , she gets a little rough , and ... Seriously ? I mean , I turn into like ... I just got gutted , and that 's what you 're gonna come back at me with ? All right , listen . I 've been going to the fight club . Oh , come on , man . No , Hicks , I got it under control . It 's a rush . It ... It 's good . I don 't like the tie . It 's like a noose . Nooses kill people . It 's a tombstone unveiling , Gary . Men wear ties . And ... My goodness , you look great . Yeah , I know . ( CHUCKLES ) I ... I don 't think that this is gonna make me feel any better , though . Dr. Rosen says that I need catharsis . But I ... I don 't think you can get catharsis from words on a rock . Well , it 's not a rock . It 's a memorial . It 's not even her words , you know ? If ... If there 're gonna be words , they should at least be Anna 's words . Tuck your shirt in . Oh , Nina . You bought me this suit . A year ago . Well , I didn 't buy it , but ... Yeah , I remember . You look great , Gary . Yeah , I know . You 're a criminal , but you 're not in jail . RACHEL : She should be in jail , but apparently Dr. Rosen thinks we need her . Oh , so you 're back on the team . She 's not a part of my team . Rachel , look , I 'm sorry for what I did to you . I know my actions hurt a lot of people ... Please , don 't . I 'm not interested . Come on , Gary . HOSPITAL INTERCOM : Black carrying case . 47 . ROSEN : His name is Adam Gordon . He had been fine for a long time . Something must have triggered this . Is that what they 're saying ? Well ... Where are you going ? Morning . ROSEN : One of the analysts flagged a YouTube video from a hospital security camera of a former patient of mine . And then pulled it immediately . Gotta keep a lid on this Alpha thing . Let me know how it goes with the senator . Yeah . ( ELEVATOR BELL DINGS ) Hey ! Valet service at the elevator , high-class joint you got . We running a bed and breakfast now ? I 'm just gonna run a sleep study on Kat tonight , see if we can figure out what 's going on with her memory . Uh , I 'm sorry . We have to , uh ... Ah , it 's cool . You can set yourself up in my office . Yeah . You know where the kitchen is . Yeah , get out of here . ( ELEVATOR BELL DINGS ) Hello , Senator . It 's a beautiful hotel , isn 't it ? Did you know that Mayor La Guardia lived here in the ' 30s ? He kept a suite upstairs . No , Senator , I didn 't , but , can I ask you a question ? Hmm . ( ECHOING ) You want to answer me truthfully . Of course . Your campaign received substantial donations from the Llamrei Foundation . Did you do something for them in return ? Yes . What exactly ? I can 't tell you that . Yes , you can . I can 't . It 's gone . Thank you , Senator . ( SIREN BLARING ) ADAM : Maggie was alive , Dr. Rosen . She was begging for my help . I would have done anything . No , I ... I understand , Adam . I know how close you and your sister always were . She was my best friend . Hmm . I found out she was using about six months ago . Oh , that 's a shame . I figured , tough love , you know ? I 'd cut her off . Maybe she 'd clean up . The important thing is that your tried , Adam . Now , listen , intense grief can often have devastating effects upon a person . And we both know that , uh , your emotions have always been right at your fingertips . So to speak . I 'd like to send you to a clinic where you can get the kind of support you need right now . With your permission , of course . Yeah . Two gentlemen I work with , a Mr. Harken and a Mr. Hicks , will escort you there , uh , once your paperwork is all filled out . Don 't be too hard on yourself . So the orderlies are bringing him down . Yes , here are his medical records . The paperwork for the transfer to the clinic is almost done . Uh , be gentle . He 's been through a lot . You 're not staying ? No , I 've got some pressing business I need to attend to . Um , I 'll be in touch . ( ELEVATOR RATTLING ) ( CRASHING ) Relax , this has been happening around these floors lately . MAGGIE : Adam , help me . They 're hurting me . They won 't let me out . Maggie ? You okay ? I need to get to Maggie ! I need to get out ! Let me off ! ( GRUNTING ) Let me out of here ! ( GROANING ) HARKEN : Is he okay ? I need help over here ! Somebody ! Don 't take no for an answer There 's no telling where we 've been Because people don 't understand , understand , understand People don 't understand People like me RABBI : In life , Anna never spoke , but she can speak to us now , beckoning us to honor her memory by living our own lives in peaceful acceptance of one another . Anna is still with us . She 's not with us though . She 's dead . No , Gary , he means in spirit . She 's still with us in spirit . Anna lives on in our hearts . No , she doesn 't live on . That 's the ... That 's the problem . Gary , shh . No , why ... Why does he get to talk ? GARY : And he 's lying . RACHEL : We should go . Come on . Because Anna wasn 't peaceful . She was a rebel . Now she 's a dead rebel . Oh , please excuse us . I 'm sorry . This probably wasn 't the best idea . No , it was a horrible idea . Oh . I ... I didn 't get any catharsis . We should ... Oh . ( CELL PHONE RINGS ) Your phone 's ringing . I 'm so sorry . It 's embarrassing for you . Uh , where do I put my stone ? This was a beautiful service . Thank you . HICKS : This guy 's delusional and violent . POLICE OFFICER : Mmm-hmm . We need to find him before he hurts anyone else . You understand ? Okay . Thanks . Are they covering the exits ? Yeah , they got it . Yeah . We 're not sick . We 're on official business . So you have to respect the badge . They get it . You can put the badge away now . Hey , any sign of him ? Here , take a whiff of this . Excuse me . It 's Adam 's shirt . I 'm not a dog . That 's right . She 's not a dog , Hicks . What do you smell ? ADAM : I 'm drowning . It 's a sound , actually . HOSPITAL INTERCOM : Orderly to room 307 . Orderly to room 307 . Gary . Gary . Yeah . Tap into the security cameras and give me a shout if you see anything , okay ? Yeah . Hicks ! What ? I 'm not a dog . I have to find better reception . RACHEL : Ooh . Adam is definitely up here . Just our luck ... It 's the closed wing at the hospital , huh . HARKEN : Yeah , just like in a horror movie . ( LIGHTS BUZZING ) I 'd be careful if I was you . Every single horror movie I have ever seen ... Yeah , the white chick is tripping and screaming , yeah . No , no , try it again . Yeah , the black guy 's gonna die first ? I don 't think so . ADAM : I 'm drowning . Please help me . Why can 't anyone hear me ? I think it 's this way , you guys . I ... I can 't pinpoint exactly where the sound 's coming from . When I talked to the hospital staff , they said that this Adam freak out isn 't the first time . Apparently a lot of weird stuff has been happening lately . Equipment 's been malfunctioning , people seeing things out of the corner of their eye , and ... These are the people in charge of my health care , huh ? Yeah , well ... ( CLEARS THROAT ) ... as an investigator , I 'm not gonna dismiss the possibility out of hand . ADAM : Please . Can anyone hear me ? Adam 's close . I can smell his fear . Okay , you know what ? I 'll take this one . Go with her . ADAM : Help me . Yeah , go get ' em , cowboy . ( ELECTRONIC SIGNALS BEEPING ) Hi , Gary . Oh . Uh , Anna . You 're dead . You can 't really be here . You can 't be . You 're dead . So what am I , then ? Anna doesn 't talk . Anna didn 't talk when she was alive . Well , I 'm different now , I guess . No , you ... Oh , sir . Sir . I ... I have ... I 'm a federal agent . I have a question . Can you see Anna there ? There 's nobody there . No , sir , look there . Hey ! Hands off , man . There are plenty of doctors here . Why don 't you go talk to one ? Well , oh , yeah , no , he could be right . I could have a brain tumor . Yeah , that would make sense . Gary , you see things all the time other people can 't . Your signals . Yeah , I see signals , but I don 't hallucinate . I don 't see hallucinations . Are you haunting me ? I just saw Senator Burton . She 's telling the truth . Now she didn 't know , but ... It felt like she thought she did . Well , if she thought she did , chances are she does know . Our memories are often stored in scattered fragments throughout our brains , hidden , trapped just out of reach . But if the information is in there , which I believe it is , I 'm thinking you might be able to retrieve it . Yeah , but I already tried pushing her . No , this is ... This is more of a pull than a push , Nina . We could use some sensory recognition technique with your ability and you could help her reconnect the bits of memory . Lee , I 've never tried anything like that . No , I ... I know . But you 've done a lot of things of late that , uh , were previously unprecedented . Now , I wouldn 't ask you to do this unless you were completely comfortable . The senator 's getting on the red-eye for London tonight . We should find her at the airport before she leaves . If she 's got part of Parish 's agenda in her head , we should get on it now . I agree . But first we have to determine whether or not you can actually pull a repressed memory . And we have the perfect test subject . Hey . What 's up ? ROSEN : Have you ever had anything like this done before ? Most likely , yeah . I don 't remember . Well , this is gonna be a little different . I want to see if Nina can help you retrieve some memory that your brain has , for whatever reason , buried away . She 's gonna ask you some questions , just relax and just answer what comes to mind . Okay . I 'm down for whatever . ( INHALES DEEPLY ) ( CLEARS THROAT ) It 's okay . Don 't be scared . I 'm not . It just felt right . ( MONITOR BEEPING ) Um , shall we start with your 16th birthday ? ( INHALES DEEPLY ) ( CLEARS THROAT ) ( ECHOING ) Focus on the walls . Can you make out a color ? Remember , it 's your birthday , Kat . Can you smell anything ? Good . Food cooking , candles burning ? Can you taste anything ? Cake ? Chocolate . Excellent . The kind of chocolate frosting that comes in a can . Beige walls , paintings , landscapes . Ugh , they suck . Nina , try to personalize it . Is anyone there with you ? There 's a woman . ( WOMAN LAUGHING ) ( GROANS SOFTLY ) Nina , are you all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine . I just , um ... I need a break . All right . It 's fine . I 've got what I need . You can do it , Nina . If we leave now , we can catch the senator at the airport . So I can take these off now , right ? Yeah , sure . Thank you for your cooperation . Just leave the money on the dresser . GARY : Why didn 't you disappear all the way ? Down the hallway , you disappeared all the way . Oh , you 're getting stronger the higher up we go , like a signal . But you 're not electromagnetic . If dead people were electromagnetic then I would have seen them before , like today at the ... Oh ! You touched me . I 'm sorry . I know you don 't like to be touched , but you put that tie on for me , and you look nice . Yeah . Oh , it 's him . ( HEARTBEAT THUMPING ) His heart is racing . Bill . He 's in here . Bill ? Bill . ADAM : Maggie , I can help . Get out ! HARKEN : The scream came from this room . Rachel ? Rachel ! She 's not answering . You were supposed to stay with her ! Now don 't try to gaslight me , Hicks . You were with her . No , I wasn 't . Rachel ! I 'm gonna get security and get them to do a floor-by-floor sweep . I 'm gonna get Rosen on this thing . This isn 't just about looking for an Alpha . This place is getting really weird . ROSEN : Bill , I understand . I 'll be there as soon as I can . ( ECHOING ) For both of us . She 's there . Nina , what did you do to your hand ? It 's fine . Don 't worry about it . When you were holding hands with Kat , is that what ... Kat spent a lot of time in hospitals , people poking around in her head . Somebody held her hand , and ... It must have been nice . Nina , if I 'm asking too much of you right now , you have to tell me , please . This isn 't worth putting you at risk . Perfect world , you wouldn 't need to use your ability at all . But the world isn 't perfect . I want to help . I like sleeping at the office , 'cause I never have to get a ride to work , and I never have to get a ride home . I 'm already home . ( GIGGLES ) Oh , you can laugh . I didn 't know that you could do that . ( CELL PHONE RINGS ) What ? Oh , wait , wait . Yeah . This better be important . I 'm talking to Anna . What ? Gary , what ? Focus . Ping Rachel 's phone . I can 't find her . Yeah , okay , Bill , I 'll get to it . But I 'm in the middle of something that I 'm doing . Did you just hang up on me ? RACHEL : Bill ! Help me ! Rachel ! Gary , you should help your friends . The neuro-diverse need to be there for each other . ( ECHOING ) Someone approached you from the foundation . Was it a man ? His scent , was he perspiring ? Was he wearing cologne ? A light scent , lemony . I couldn 't place the brand . It was a Tuesday . He was wearing a gray suit . ( KNOCK ON DOOR ) SENATOR 'S AIDE : Senator ? Our flight is boarding . Don 't lose her focus , Nina . What did he ask you to do ? Trial tests , medical . Medical what ? ( KNOCK ON DOOR ) SENATOR 'S AIDE : Senator , it 's almost time . Now think of the man . His gray suit , his scent . Medical what ? August . August . Good . This August or last year ? SENATOR 'S AIDE : Senator ? They 're boarding now . We 're old friends , just catching up . Does August mean anything to you ? We 'll figure it out . We should go . Rachel . Rachel . Rachel . ( KNOCK ON DOOR ) Rachel ? ( BUZZING ) ( RUMBLING ) HICKS : Rachel . ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) HICKS : Rachel ? TYLER : Dad ! Dad , help me ! Hello ? ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ) Dad , help me ! Dad ! Hey ! Dad ! Hey ! Help me ! Hey ! My kid 's not dead ! Hey , stop ! It 's okay , Maggie , you 're gonna be okay . I 'm gonna get you out of here . No , no , shh ! If they hear you , Maggie , they 'll put you back in the drawer , okay ? This machine drains the blood . I got to get the drugs out of you , okay ? It 'll make you clean . Okay , Maggie ? ( HANDCUFF LOCK CLICKING ) ( CLANGING ) ( GROANS ) Maggie ! ADAM : Wait , where are you going ? Why are you running from me ? HARKEN : Rachel ! Come on , come on . ( GRUNTING ) ( BANGING ) Rachel ! ( ELEVATOR CLATTERING ) MAGGIE : Help ! Help ! Help , I 'm drowning ! Help ! MAGGIE : I 'm drowning . I 'm drowning . I 'm drowning . Help me . I 'm drowning . ( WATER DRIPPING ) I 'm drowning . ( ELEVATOR BELL DINGS ) Rachel ? ( CLANKING ) Adam . Adam , help me . I 'm drowning . Maggie ? ( WATER DRIPPING ) ( SCREAMS ) Rachel . ( RUMBLING ) Gary , you scared the hell out of me . Bill , get a hold of yourself . I pinged Rachel 's phone for you . I wanted to help Anna , but she said that I should come ... Gary , what are you talking about ? Anna is dead . No , no , she 's not dead , Bill . She 's here . Wait . Are you seeing things too ? No , I 'm not seeing things . I 'm seeing Anna . She 's a person . Anyway , Rachel 's upstairs . You should go and help her . No , come on , let 's go . Yeah , no , Bill ! We got to get the hell out of here and find Rachel . You go find her . I 've got to help Anna . TYLER : Dad ! Help me ! Dad ! Tyler ! No ! No ! No ! Stop ! Dad ! Please , stop ! Dad , help me ! ( BANGING ON DOOR ) Dad ! Dad ! Tyler ! No , please , stop ! Dad ! Please let him go ! I 'll do whatever you want ! Take me instead ! Tyler ! Rachel ? Rachel ? Ra ... Rachel ! Rachel ! Rachel ! ( INSTRUMENTS VIBRATING ) Oh ! That shouldn 't be happening , just like you , Anna . This is a special phone . Skylar gave it to me . You 'd like her . She has tattoos . ( CELL PHONE BEEPS ) Oh , yeah , look . That 's what 's vibrating the cart . I found your signal , Anna . It 's infrasound . I 've read about that . What 's causing it ? I don 't know . It could be machinery , like , uh , an industrial air conditioner . So I might just be the AC ? I 'm not sure yet . HARKEN : It 's about time you got here . Rachel wrote that . And Adam is dead . Something made Adam drown himself and whatever that something is , is affecting Rachel , okay ? And I think it 's affecting Hicks as well . Now , we have to find out what it is because we are dealing with something that we don 't understand . No ! You don 't understand it , Bill . I do . It 's infrasound . What is infrasound ? It 's a sonic frequency below the threshold of normal human hearing . Yeah , and it makes things vibrate , like those tools and the lights . Yeah , it can have a dramatic effect on people 's brains . Yeah , people who aren 't even Alphas . But it affects Alphas more . Okay , so that 's gotta be affecting Rachel , right ? I mean ... Yeah , yeah ! It 's making you crazy , though , but it 's letting me see Anna . What ? You 've seen Anna ? Yeah , look . I recorded it on my phone . You can 't hear it . But you can see it , there . Gary , can you modify this signal somehow to make it audible ? Yeah , of course I can . I 'm a professional . VOICE : Help me . I 'm drowning . That 's not an air conditioner . VOICE : I 'm drowning . Drowning ? Doc , the elevator , right ? Yes . Rachel thinks she 's drowning . I ... I 've got to find her . I 've got to help her . Bill , be careful , you 're probably being affected too , so the closer you get to the source of the sound , the more powerful it will be . WOMAN : Help me . Help me , I 'm drowning . Help . Help . Oh , my God ! Nina ! We 're very close to it , ' cause Anna 's hardly disappeared up here at all . I 'm taking her to the source . All right , Gary . You 're helping Anna , right ? Yeah . Bill is desperate to help Rachel . It appears that you 're all acting on that subliminal cry for help embedded in the infrasound . But Bill thinks that it 's a spirit . He believes in spirits , Dr. Rosen . He might not be so far off , Gary . Machines don 't cry for help . People do . ( HEARTBEAT THUMPING ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( GROANING ) ( ELECTRIC WHIRRING ) ( HEART THUMPING ) ( SCREAMS ) There were three near-drowning patients last year , Stacy Fung , discharged after two days . Andrew Mittman , D.O.A. That 's dead on arrival . And there 's Jason Miller . He ... Oh , Dr. Rosen ! He 's still here . 1626 . 1626 . Yeah . Oh , that 's on another floor . Persistent vegetative state . It says that he 's brain-dead . Well , that might not be accurate . The machines might not be registering brain activity . But if he is communicating somehow ... Oh , no , Dr. Rosen , it says that his parents are gonna let them harvest his organs for transplant . He 's 16 . Well , if the doctors believe that he was indeed brain-dead , they would never have tried to revive him . Gary , stay right here for a moment . But , Dr. Rosen , where are you going ? I think there may be a way to save this boy and stop the infrasound . I 'll be right back . What 's wrong , Gary ? Adam 's an Alpha , and the infrasound ... It affected his brain . He saw his dead sister . And I 'm an Alpha , and I can see you . You 're not real . But I like seeing you . We 're gonna find Jason before Dr. Rosen does . ( PANTING ) This way . Yeah . Yeah , this is it . That 's him , Anna . He 's emitting the infrasound . And look ... Look , the machines say that he 's dead . Machines don 't understand us . ( LOCK BEEPS ) Gary , open the door , please . No ! Gary , open the door ! Gary , we can 't locate Bill , Cameron or Rachel . But if I 'm right , they 're in serious trouble . I have to wake Jason up ! It 's the only way to stop the infrasound . No , Dr. Rosen ! If you wake him up , then I 'm gonna lose Anna , again ! You know that , Dr. Rosen ! Gary , listen to me . You 're not thinking clearly right now . Yeah , I know ! But I don 't want to think clearly . Dr. Rosen , I couldn 't save Anna at Highland Mills , but I can this time . ( GRUNTS ) The Anna you see right now , she 's an hallucination . And what she is saying to you is what you want her to say . No ! No ! That 's not true ! Gary , she is not real . Yes ! She 's real , 'cause she touched me . And she says things that only Anna would say . All right , then ask her . Ask Anna what you should do . No , I don 't want to ask her . Maybe Anna needs to tell you something . ( SCREAMING ) Gary , please . Please . Gary , Jason 's one of us . You couldn 't help me , but you can save his life . He 's crying out for help . Gary , the neuro-diverse need to be there for each other . ( GRUNTS ) ( LOCK BEEPS ) Sorry , Dr. Rosen . Thank you , Gary . We have to stick together . ( MONITOR BEEPING ) ( GROANING ) Ah ! ( GASPS ) You did the right thing , Gary . ( PANTING ) Come on , Rachel . Come on . Come on . Come on . ( COUGHING ) ( COUGHING ) Bill . Jason , do you remember anything about what 's happened to you , like , uh , sensations of drowning , feeling trapped in your mind , trying to cry out for help ? Nothing ? All right , um , can I do anything for you ? Uh , can I , um ... Can I have some chips ? Sure . What kind ? I like the , uh , salt and vinegar kind . Sure . I think we can make that happen . Thanks . Is that a photic stimulator ? Yes . How long has it been in use in this hospital ? About six months . Was that device ever used on this man ? We use it on all comatose patients to test brain activity . Cameron ? You can 't just show up here without my permission . I 'm sorry . I got to see him . Please . Dad ? What are you doing here ? Hi . What are you doing , huh ? ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) Rachel , are you all right ? I 'm fine . Thanks for asking . ( FOOTSTEPS DEPARTING ) WOMAN : ( ON COMPUTER ) When sketching the female form , start with a long vertical line divided in two unequal parts . The long part will be the body and the short part will be the head . Sketch the body creating a skeleton using horizontal lines for hips and shoulders and vertical lines for arms and legs . As you get the hang of the proportions , gradually employ curvature . The female form can be divided into approximately eight circles up and down with cylindrical shapes for the arms and joints . As women have more rounded bodies than men , their hips should always be drawn the same width as the shoulders . Light and shadow are key to rendering life like images . People know how shadows play across the curves and crevices of the female body . By properly shading the creases of the skin , you 'll create the illusion that the figure is lifelike and three dimensional . ( WOMAN LAUGHING ) ( DEVICE PULSING ) Dr. Rosen ... I tracked down where every photic stimulator from August Medical went . Oh , great . 2,700 different hospitals . 2,700 ? Across the country , yeah . And there 's 42 different models of this . ( SIGHS ) That 's a lot . And we have no idea what this thing does to people 's brains or how it fits into Stanton Parish 's agenda , if indeed it does . Gary , do you remember the young woman who built you your phone ? Yes , Skylar . But she wasn 't young . Do you still have it with you ? Yeah , of course I have it . It was a present . You 're supposed to keep presents , even if you don 't like them . And , yeah , she said I could call her on this . Well , I 'm thinking she might be the one to figure out how this thing works . Oh , does she speak Chinese ? I don 't know . Why ? Oh , these were manufactured in China , and I don 't speak Chinese . Anna speaks Chinese . Speaks Chinese , Gary ? You , you just referred to Anna in the present tense . It 's okay if you think of Anna as still being with you , but you should realize that ... Oh , no , I don 't think that . She was with me , and now she 's not with me . But I found another way to honor Anna , so ... All right . Dr. Rosen , it 's late . You , you should go home , because you don 't live here , but I do . I live here . Yes , that 's right . Thanks , Gary .

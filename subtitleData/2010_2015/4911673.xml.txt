 II' II' ( bird squawking ) ( birds chirping ) II' Whoa ... Grab that ladder , bro . Okay . Grab everything that you 've got . Where the hell are we ? Where are we headed ? Due north . It 's a hike . Then another ten minute ride in . What , man ? Are you serious ? 'Cause you already had us travelling an hour in this wilderness . What 's the matter , Tex ? - Tired already ? - Fuck you , man . Man : Well , come on . I said north ! Come on , man , it 's freezing here . Just keep moving . Ready to win this ? Sleeping bag - Megs . I can 't wait to get to Florida . We can share lodgings . ( Chuckling ) ( bird squawking ) Phew ! What 's that smell ? Mam II' ( mosquitoes buzzing ) Don 't you think you 're overdoing it ? They 're just kids . Death 's an exact science . II' All aboard ! Nice ride . - Hoes before bros . - You 're an ass . ( Engine sputtering ) man : I 'm going to the back , drink cocktails ... ( engine backfiring ) II' Okay , you got me on this one . Man : Over the next few hours , copper oxide from the coins will react with the body fluids . Leaving a coin imprint on the body tissue , used for determining the length of time the body 's laid there . Smart . These kids won 't know what 's hit them . Anything I should know about ? They 've been washed down with acid long ago . Used for our company 's offender rehabilitation programs a while back . You can 't leave dead bodies lying around a national park . 13 Eerie 's the ideal spot . No one 's been here in years . It 's gonna feel more like a boot camp than a science retreat . Well , unfortunately , most crime scenes are inhospitable . My students are up to the challenge . You hear that ? What ? That 's just it- - Nothing . Where 's the wildlife ? II' Larry , how 'd you get involved in this ? Probation . So , not your first time on the prison bus ? Anything about this place we need to know ? What you got here is Guantanamo Bay 's ugly twin sister . Joking aside , some bad shit has happened here in the past . Man : Great . What you got is your new D-MORT . Your what ? Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team . Go , Daniel . What kind of bad shit ? Larry : I don 't know . Take a look . Your guess is as good as mine . Man : Oh , man . Welcome to hell . II' Driver 's Larry Jessop . I had him set up the communication system you wanted . He 'll assist you . You rely on him for anything you need . Larry Jessop . Tomkins . I 'll be your chauffeur and your chef and your all-around dog 's body . I need you to charge up the communication batteries . Okay . Welcome to Eerie Strait . There are only two places available in the forensic trainee 's scheme . You will need to work in pairs . Each group will be assigned a plot within the complex . Study it thoroughly . Some of you will be working alongside entomology . Others will be combining your expertise in toxicology and geology . This is quite deliberate . Forensic science D-MORT internship does not discriminate science applications when a full passenger flight or passenger train crashes . Compound secured perimeter means nothing gets in or out . Plot 13 Eerie Strait is now uninhabited , surrounded by low-lying swampland . If you check page two , there are three basic cabins . One is for food and equipment , the other is for accommodation , while this one is for surveillance and instructions . Eerie 's out of range for cell phone use , so you will be given walkie-talkies . Each site is in a remote area of the camp so there will be no contact between groups . Questions ? No ? Good . Get your things , we 'll meet back here . Looks like we 're on different teams . Just as well . You 'd only cheat at pathology . - What about Josh ? - Uh , he 's with Stetson . One thing 's for sure- - this place is a rathole . This is gonna be like a day trip with Charlie Manson . II' No , no , no , no , no . The meat goes over there . That is not the kitchen . Drop it and come back for your kit . - What 's in ' em ? - How would I know ? I drive the bus . Just drop your stuff and come back for it . In there , but don 't touch anything . II' ( clattering ) ( banging ) II' ( sizzling ) ( coughing ) Oh fuck ! - ( Sizzling ) - Agh , shit . ( Sighing ) Be done by breakfast . Better be . Gotta get those bodies back to the morgue . ( Engine revving ) II' Beds are for sleeping only . Any more than one person per bed and it will break . - Is that a joke ? - That 's a joke . - That was a joke , right ? - Ha , ha , ha . You 're fucking kidding me . What were you expecting , Megan , a mint on your pillow ? Yeah , that 's right . I think I will take this one if you ... ( screaming ) Are you getting friendly with the locals ? There 's lunch . ( Beeping ) ( whirring ) II' Prof wants us back at the command center . That used to be a cat . Daniel 's already got some pussy in his bed . Meow . II' ( door slamming ) Time is 11 : 20 hours . Get into your designated groups . You 'll be working in isolated areas . Personal radio contact is strictly prohibited . Conversing outside of your allotted team will disqualify not only yourself , but your partner as well . I will lead the chemical analysis tomorrow with Captain Veneziano . It will be cold . You 'll work through the night . Criminals don 't pick the perfect beach in Hawaii to make life comfortable for forensic scientists , so get used to it . Pick up your gear on the way out . And good luck . II' See the prison back there , coming in ? Whoever was there before sure didn 't want people leaving in a hurry . What the hell have I got myself into ? II' ( computer beeping ) ( camera whirring ) ( beeping ) ( camera whirring ) ( beeping ) ( whirring ) II' ( sizzling ) ( chopping ) II' ( beeping ) II' II' II' ( groaning ) Oh , shit ! Dude , it 's just a field exam . Yeah , buddy . I just get a little bit claustrophobic . Well , man up . Why don 't you shut up ? You couldn 't have picked a worse place to die . II' II' 11 : 55 hours . II' Taking trace evidence of soil , mineral , and what looks to be dried blood . Ready ? Yeah . ( Creaking ) ( mosquitoes buzzing ) II' Daniel : Maggots . That 's our first line of investigation . ( Swallowing ) If you 're gonna puke , do it in the bushes . Otherwise , you 'll contaminate the area . I 'm fine , man . I 'm okay . 15 millimeters . Means the corpse has been dead one week . Look . Pupal casings . They 've already started the metamorphosis into adult flies . ( gagging ) Group " C , " you 're gonna need to collect the larva and prepare a full field analysis . ( Retching ) How long do we have ? All night , but don 't drag your heels . Sundown in approximately three hours . Oh , and by the way I 've downgraded you both to 60 % due to Mr. Novagratz throwing up . Daniel : Have a cold one on me , Colonel Fucking Mustard . Tomkins : Group " A , " after your sample collection , I want you to do a standard biochemical analysis . Temper , temper . II' ( sizzling ) Hey ! II' Yes ? You heard about this place , right ? Why ? Well , you heard the rumors . Eerie Pen , death row inmates , one-way ticket . Government started doing crazy tests and ... poison ends up in the water supply . Women start having babies before their time or worse . I mean , nothing lives here . No one lives here . What are you trying to tell me ? Two of my chickens are missing . Maybe they flew away . This is a scientific examination , Mr. Jessop . My students are working into the night . We have a responsibility to them , so I would appreciate it if you could deliver the food to the groups . Just follow the colored flags . Shoot , Larry . Welcome to summer camp . II' ( sizzling ) II' Oh ! Oh , shit ! What are you doing ? - ( Liquid spilling ) - Shit ! How you doin ' ? Here . The fluids on that coin and the imprint left on the body will tell us how long it 's been here . You running it ? Yup . Here I am playing nursemaid to a bunch of college butt jerk-offs . Shoulda stayed in jail . II' Holy shit ! Hey , hey , hey , hey , no , no , no , stop ! Contamination area ! I thought back there was your site . Where 's the markers for your body ? You 're standing on one . You can clearly see the site we 're working in . You got two bodies ? ( gagging ) Maybe you shouldn 't be so close . Some people can have unexpected issues with this type of medical science . Listen , baby doll , I know what I saw . There 's another body . A woman , kinda , 200 yards up by the ruined building . You don 't believe me , go take a look for yourself . Tomkins : Group " A , " you are not allowed to speak to any third party . Mr. Jessop , I have already told you this is a scientific field exam . We 're midway through a forensic medical procedure . Professor Tomkins asked you to leave . I 'll go take a look if you want . Be my guest . ( Coughing ) II' Well , is that one of yours ? No . Professor Tomkins- - over ? Tomkins : Team " A , " go ahead . Did you put out three cadavers for medical research ? Tomkins : Yes , why ? Well , we 've located another one . She 's female , Caucasian , approximately 30 to 40 years of age . Tomkins : Impossible . Go back and support your colleague . ( Static blaring ) Do you copy ? ( static blaring ) Jeez . ( Inhaling ) - ( yelling ) - What ? What ? She- - she moved . Idiot . No , she- - II' Ms. Cranston , report back to your team leader . Mr. Jessop , report back to base . - Over . - Yes , sir . This place is one stop from hell . ( Growling ) Daniel : First stage decomposition . Temperature must have been over 52 degrees Fahrenheit for the blowflies to fly out of the cadaver . II' They also like salsa , playing poker , and they make a mean margarita . I saw something , over there . Look . We 've already been downgraded because you puked , so ... let 's try and get this part right , shall we ? So the temperature must have been over 52 degrees Fahrenheit for the blowflies to fly out of the cadaver . ( Static blaring ) Oh , thank God , they didn 't cheap out on the walkies . Larry was right . There 's a female corpse in our patch . Maybe we should go take a look . Uh , well , we 've only just started analysis on this one , so why don 't we get cause of death first and then I 'll go take a look with you . Tomkins didn 't say there - ' d be two . Well , that 's the thing with the professor . He is always challenging us , setting up situations . That 's why he 's the best and that 's why we are here . Should we check in with him ? Ah , walkies down . No . And he said we 're on our own . So , what 's he always telling us ? Forensic science is a slow , patient , and dedicated analysis . Right . It 's all in the details . That 's how you catch bad guys . So why don 't we please just concentrate on our lady of the lake here because I need this internship . Not all of us have private funds to get us through college . Well , what if we 're supposed to find them ? Remember what lvanek told us happened last year . Well , if you 're so worried , why don 't you take this , get us something to look at and come back in , like , five minutes . I need you . II' ( door closing ) II' Place gives me the creeps . Daniel : Just hold on a second , right there . Hey , hey , hey , hey. hey. hey , hey , stop , wait ! This is a contaminated area . Well , whatever man . Can I help you ? Watch your back . What the hell does that mean ? I don 't know . Smells like dog food . My battery 's dead . Mine 's on the way out as well . ( Sighing ) II' ( growling ) ( growling ) II' Team " C , " how far have you gotten with your measurements ? Sir , Rob 's got 95 % of the larva measurements ... ( static blaring ) Daniel : losing battery power ... walkie-talkie ... Should we head back to camp and replace them ? Report back to base . Copy that , headed back . I found some tissue under the fingernail . Let 's head back and take care of this battery situation . II' Oof ... oh ! Here . Did you see that ? I swear it was ... someone in an orange prison suit . A lifer jump suit . You been smoking some of Larry 's pot ? II' Group " A , " Group " A , " return to base camp . Over . ( Static blaring ) Group " A , " Group " B , " can you hear me ? ( Static blaring ) Larry , where the hell are you ? ( Static blaring ) II' II' ( static blaring ) Professor ? ( Static blaring ) Professor ? ( Static blaring ) II' ( snarling in distance ) ( breathing heavily ) ( growling ) ( snarling ) ( growling ) Hello ? - Anyone there ? - ( growling ) Kate : Hello ?

I 'm in the middle of electrophoresis on the corpse . Oh , I 'm sorry , dude . Should I leave you two alone to get it on ? Here . Did you get anything out of the walkies ? No , not a thing . Also , we 're out of body fluid cleaner . ( Kate screaming in distance ) - Did you hear that ? - Yeah . Those guys are probably just messing around . I need to cross reference the results from the fluids on that coin , but I think this body 's been here about 12 hours . Daniel , Meg , is that you ? Weird . - Ow ! - You all right ? Just let me out , just let me out . - Okay , just wait . - Fuck ! Ow- - Fuck , let me out . - Ow ! - Whoa , whoa , whoa . Hey , hey , hey , what 's up ? Don 't panic . Just breathe into it , you 'll be okay . Where are you going ? What are you looking at , man ? There 's nothing there . ( Breathing heavily ) I 'm going to see the prof . No , no , man , you don 't quit on me . I 'm not quitting on you , Patrick . Everybody gets the shakes , man . It 's common . It 'll blow over . - That scream wasn 't someone ... - Come on , Josh . Just playing around and I just saw something move in the woods over there . You can 't just leave me here . Goddammit ! Kate ! II' ( Kate crying ) Oh my God , oh my God ! Oh my God ! Help ! Kate , come with me , come with me , come with me ! Here , you 'll be okay . Stand , stand , stand , stay up , stay up , stay up . Okay ... oh God . Sit down , sit down , sit down , sit down . Oh sorry , oh sorry ! Oh , okay , okay , okay . Don 't go into shock , don 't go into shock , don 't go into shock , don 't go into shock , don 't go into shock ! Let me see , stay awake ! ( Moaning ) Okay , no , stay awake ! Oh God , sorry , okay , okay . Listen , listen , listen , this is going to sting a little . ( whimpering ) ( distorted voice on walkie-talkie ) Oh God . Hey . Professor ? Daniel ? Anybody ? ( Static blaring ) Kate 's been hurt . No ! Oh shit ! No , no , no , no , no , no . II' ( breathing heavily ) ( breathing heavily ) II' Group " C , " Group " A , " can you hear me ? Group " C , " Group " A , " come in . Over . Where the hell have you been ? The communication system 's completely screwed . The monitors are going down . We gotta get those kids outta here and I mean right now . Really . And what do you base that conclusion on ? Something was following me . Moved like a man . Sounded like an animal . I hit my head . I was out cold . I was so still that it lost me . See I spoke with Veneziano when I got this detail . He knows all about it . I thought he was pulling my leg , you know , trying to put a scare on me . All those things you hear about military experiments and changing a man 's DNA , make a creature fueled only by rage . Well , that all happened , and I think that maybe they left something behind or maybe something escaped . So , now what ? They 're chasing you ? That dead thing by Group " A " that was one of ' em . You know what ? I 'm getting really sick of your conspiracy pothead bullshit . Professor , you are a smart man , but we stay here ... you gonna learn something . You know what I 've learned so far ? You can 't do your job . None of the walkies are working . Come with me . II' What now ? Generator 's going . There 's a short in the system somewhere . II' ( grunting ) ( slurping ) ( roaring ) What the hell happened here ? What happened , see , was stuff came out of the barrel and , um , it- - it- - it melted them . Just poured out by itself ? Look at this . You can see through the goddamn wires . Well , hell , it 's not my fault . I didn 't put that crap there . What worries me is what 's in that evil shit . Yeah , well , what worries me is you being a moron . Yeah , I know , your walkies are dead . Larry , replace them . I 'll give you an extra time credit to cover the delay . That 's a little present from Mr. Jessop . Is it gonna work ? All right , let 's head back . We need to fix this . Uh ... Go check the monitors . Today . Larry ! ( Grunting ) ( engine revving ) ( inhaling ) II' ( growling ) Oh , shit ! ( Snarling ) ( growling ) ( screaming ) Stop ! ( Gurgling ) ( groaning ) ( shuddering ) - ( engine running ) - ( switches clicking ) ( snarling ) ( electric buzzing ) II' ( banging ) - Open the door . - We need to get inside . Where is everybody ? ( Whispering ) One of those corpses is walking around . What did he just say ? He said one of the corpses has come to life . What ? What the hell is this ? You think an animal did this ? My money 's on the professor . He 's playing games with us . He wants to see how we 'll react . Let 's grab some samples . Look at them under the microscope . This is no animal . Where are you going ? Rob , come on , you 're gonna get us disqualified . I have to follow my instincts . My gut 's telling me get outta here . Well , say hi to your buddy in the orange jumpsuit for me . It 's just a test ! II' Where are the others ? You tell me . You checked all the connections ? I saw something on the monitor . Because of you , I may have to cancel this entire examination . I saw something in the woods . You are both welcome to quit anytime you want . I heard screams . There was screaming . Listen , you 're all overreacting , all right ? Now , that 's very common when dealing with real corpses for the first time . Look , man , we just want to know what 's going on . Larry : Hey , guys , why don 't we just get on the bus and go home ? II' II' ( growling in distance ) ( snarling ) ( growling ) ( roaring ) II' ( panting ) - ( growling ) - Ahh ! ( Snarling ) Ahh , fuck ! ( Grunting ) ( yelling ) ( screaming ) ( yelling ) ( yelling ) ( growling ) ( screaming ) ( Rob screaming in distance ) Is that Rob ? Is that a gun ? Give it to me , I 'll go find them . Sit down ! You 're safer in here . You think that peashooter 's gonna help ? That thing I saw out there was already deader than dirt . - Did you hear that one ? - Hey , hey , man . What did you see out there ? I told you , college boy , I saw a dead person and he was walking around . - I 'm going out there . - No , no , no , man . We stand a better chance together . We stand a better chance if we just roll outta here . Call in an air strike . I think the safety of all my students is at risk here , Mr. Jessop . Now , are you volunteering to run out and find them , especially after you destroyed all of our equipment ? No ? Then I suggest that everyone stay put until we can get our eyes and ears up and running . II' ( grunting and chewing ) ( slurping ) ( growling ) II' II' ( doorknob rattling ) Daniel : Hey , come on . Open the door . What the hell 's going on ? Where 's Rob ? I thought he was with you , man . We heard screams . Where 's Megan ? How the hell should I know ? What do you mean ? Maybe their group was attacked first . What do you mean attacked ? What do you mean attacked ? What do you mean ? - Who , who ? - Hey , hey ... ( all yelling ) - He hasn 't done anything ! - Stop it ! - Stop it ! - Never mind ! She can handle herself , she 's a fighter ! Yeah , that 's what worries me . Just stop it , all right ? Fighting with each other is not gonna help Megan or anybody else . Now , while I don 't believe a goddamn word this asshole says , I do concede there may be someone or something out there . I 'm going to find her . Let 's go find Rob .

You better pray there 's only one . ( floor creaking ) ( growling ) - ( gunshot firing ) - Ahh ! ( Banging ) - There 's two of them . - I know ! I said not to open the goddamned door ! This shit 's all over me . - Did it bite ya ? ! - No . Where 's the gun ? Oh , crap . II' ( breathing heavily ) II' ( panting ) ( door creaking ) ( snarling in distance ) Megan : Hey , asshole !

I 'm gonna make a Molotov cocktail ... and we 're gonna bum that bitch . Yeah , yeah . I 'm getting the gun . Yeah , a gun will be better . A gun will be better . It 's there .

How do you get off this fucking island ? ! We gotta cross that river and we gotta scale barbed wire . How many of them are there ? I don 't know . That 's not my blood . II' I killed Kate and Rob . I had to ! Okay . We 're gonna get out of here , okay ? We 're gonna get out of here . Okay . If I get bit by one of those , you have to shoot me in the head . You listen to me . No , this is not gonna happen . You 're not gonna tum into one of those things . - I promise . - Okay . II' ( snarling in distance ) Hey. hey ! - What is it ? There . ( Growling ) Oh shit !

But that was years ago . Jesus Christ , you broke my nose . I lost four people in there . Kids ! You and whoever the hell else knew about this place are gonna pay . Professor !

 Previously on Touch ... Adeline Denvers ? That 's their cover name for Amelia . I think they 've lost her . I don 't think Aster Corps has her . So if Aster Corps doesn 't have her , who does ? I want to go home ! This isn 't working . This right here is the God sequence . I 'm talking * evolution of the entire human species . And I 'm not gonna just give it up for some mindless profit , I can 't do that . You 've never been on my side , Tony . Aster Corps is one of the most powerful corporations in the world , and I believe they 're involved in criminal activity . I think they 've engaged in murder , kidnapping to get what they want , and I think they 'll stop at nothing to destroy anyone who gets in their way . CALVIN : When I left Aster Corps , they took all my research . I want it back . You can walk into that building ; I can 't . This is the man that killed Claudia Corliss . This is Amelia 's birthday party three and a half years ago . Why is this stranger standing behind my daughter six months after he killed someone just like her ? Uh , Martin ? Martin ? Jake ! What 's going on ? Everything all right ? Everything 's fine . I 'm sorry . I-I just need to show you something . Okay . Look . Did you get any sleep ? I printed this all up from the internet . I think I understand now what Jake was trying to tell me . Here . This man in the picture obviously has some kind of interest in my daughter , right ? They never found out his name , but the man in the picture with Amelia is the man that killed Claudia Corliss , a person Jake also led me to . Claudia Corliss was a gifted astronomer , of almost magical ability . - Okay . - Okay . So maybe he 's after a certain type of person . A person like Amelia or Jake . And then what we found , Adeline Danvers , their code name for Amelia , suddenly stops in New York . And , like you said , maybe Aster Corps doesn 't even have her anymore . Wait a second . You-you think that this guy took Amelia from the board and care facility in New York ? That doesn 't make sense . If he took her , she 'd be dead , and we know for a fact that a week ago she was alive , walking on the beach alone . Obviously , Jake wants us to know about this guy , but ... ( phone vibrates ) What ? Calvin Norburg wants me to meet him at 10 : 00 . Look , I 've got to get Jake up and ready for school . I think you 're on to something . Just ... just keep looking . JAKE : Sometimes storms do not arrive full-blown . Sometimes , they build over days , or even weeks . An Arctic storm , moving southward , can suddenly crash into a tropical hurricane that 's driving north . And when these collisions of weather systems occur , it causes the storm to explode . The sum total of their destructive energy is far greater than what any of them would have been had they remained on their own , creating what meteorologists sometimes call " perfect conditions " for a deadly storm . Hey . There you go . See you Tuesday , pal . JAKE : A perfect storm . - Can I help you ? - Yes , sir , please . I 'm looking for a resident called Martin Bohm . Ah , I 'm sorry . He doesn 't live here anymore . Did he leave a forwarding address ? I have a very important business with him and ... his son , Jake . Perhaps you have seen him ? No forwarding address . Thank you . Okay . You sure about the umbrella , buddy ? It doesn 't rain here that often . It 's a lot different than New York . Okay . Well , you got your lunch and your snack in your backpack , and I am gonna be the man standing right here when you 're finished , okay ? What 's that ? " 5991 . " ( phone ringing ) What the ... ? ( ringing continues ) Hello ? Martin Bohm . Is that you ? Avram ? ( laughs softly ) How did you get this number ? I received three calls last night from someone who did not speak . I took a wild guess , and decided it was Jake . I 'm so sorry . I-I didn 't even think he 'd use this thing . It 's for his teacher in case they need to get in touch with me . I guess he misses you . I miss him , too . May I tell him something ? Okay , hold on one second . It 's Avram . But I guess you knew that . ( giggles softly ) ( giggles ) Avram , did you hear that ? He laughed ! Yes , I heard . Tremendous . What did you say ? I told him a joke , of course . This trip to California has been great for us . I mean , just after we got here , he actually held my hand . Touch . A breakthrough for Jake . Maybe this means he 's getting close to the girl . Amelia ? Let 's hope so , for Lucy 's sake . Amelia 's mother , yes . How are the living arrangements working out for you ? Good . Thank you for taking care of that . I 'm glad to have been of service . Until we speak again , be well , Martin Bohm . You , too , Avram . Bye-bye . Mr. Norburg ? Thanks , Dave . Did you get it ? Mallory Cane 's red-level pass card . One of a handful in existence . It 'll grant you access to every single locked door inside Aster Corps , including room 1075 , where they keep the main server . I need you to download every file with my name on it . And for my trouble ? Any other Aster Corps files you want to grab while you 're in there , that 's up to you ; you 're the reporter . I 'm-I 'm flattered that you would let me look at your files . Oh , you 're not gonna be looking at them 'cause you won 't be able to open them . But it 's just my research . It 's not the story you 're chasing , so ... I printed out a schematic of the floor plan . This is room 1075 . Whatever you do , stay away from these offices over here . Why ? These offices belong to Tony Rigby . Tony Rigby was my best friend . He took my departure from Aster Corps personally . He 's not the kind of guy you want taking anything personally . If he catches you , it 's over . Okay . You wanted a story ... go get it . I 'll see you back here at 4 : 00 . Yeah . Good luck . ( sighs ) - I thought you said 11 : 15 . - Yes . 11 : 15 . It 's 11 : 40 . Look . I told you , I don 't have a lot of time . Yes . Now is time . You see ? Classic . ( click ) ( lively music plays ) - $ 200 . - I said no electronics . It interferes with the ... Look , I told you , spring-loaded only . Yes . And you said 11 : 15 . Shigeru Fukura ... don 't let me down . A hundred eighty ? ( rattling ) ♪ ( sighs ) ( key jangling ) Yes , noon service at the Beth Ohave Synagogue . Lunch after ? Good . I 'll see you there . ♪ ( children chattering ) Yo , Jake . Chores bite . Which one did you get ? Hey , stop ! He doesn 't like to be touched . He totally freaks out . I saw your red umbrella . You know , it never rains in LA , right ? What are you smiling about ? You got rabbit hutch cleanup . That 's , like , the worst job there is . ( Soleil scoffs ) No way ! I got hutch cleanup , too ? ( chirp ) ( sighs ) What the hell ? Oh , damn it . They moved the servers . May I help you ? Yes . I need to see Tony Rigby . Can I ask what this is about ? You can tell him it 's about Calvin Norburg , and we need to talk . ( chirp ) Thank you , Anna . That 's a high-level employee key . You 're saying Calvin Norburg gave it to you ? He stole it from Mallory Cane , gave it to me this morning , and wanted me to come here and download all his files . Sorry . What 's to stop me from having you arrested right now ? For what- - trespassing ? Calvin contacted me because he wanted me to do a story on Aster Corps , primarily focusing on the company 's alleged criminal activities- - most recently , the attempted murder of Vikash Nayar , and the illegal detention of Mallory Cane in Pakistan . But as a reporter , I 'm responsible to tell the truth . And the truth is , I think Calvin Norburg is insane . I think he 's become delusional . And then it occurred to me . That 's an even better story . He dropped your stock 38 % because of his public meltdown . I could write a story that would completely exonerate Aster Corps . So , why did you come looking for me ? You give me access to his files , and I can take him down for you . For a price , of course . What 's to stop you using anything you find against the company ? The last thing I want to do is take on a company the size of Aster Corps . I 'm a freelance journalist . All those years in court- - I could never afford it . How much are we talking about ? I 'd say we could handle that , but it 's not that simple . I 've already tried to open Calvin 's files . They 're encrypted with some sort of numerical algorithm . He gave me the algorithm this morning . If you can open those files , you 've got yourself a deal . Good . Then you can stop recording our conversation now . ( scoffs ) Come with me . - Hey . TREVOR : - Oh , hey , Luce . Martin 's not here . I know . I 'm looking for you . - Uh , why ? Did you run out of MMs at home ? - Hell , no . I came for my fix of Donkey Kong . Come here . ( computer chirps , typing rapidly ) Wow . Now there 's a search engine . Mine cuts off at the Atlantic Ocean . Europe , South America and Asia , all in one tasty , bite-sized morsel . Who knew there were so many unsolved murders ? Hmm . We got to narrow the search . How about this ? Try some , uh , keywords ? Uh , " genius " and " savant . " Maybe they appear - in the their obituaries . - Let 's see . Ooh , not bad . 18 results . Okay . Frederick LeMay from Brussels . Throat slashed in his bakery . No sign of forced entry , or stolen property . Odd . Maybe it was a lover 's quarrel . Remind me not to set you up with any of my friends . You have friends ? Ha . Next slide , please . ( computer chirps ) Rosemary Mathis . Architect from Barcelona , throat slashed with a knife . Interesting . Just like Frederick LeMay . And Claudia Corliss . I think you 're on to something here . I think I am , too . Oh , wait . This . Can you get a facial recognition on him ? I still don 't know his name . Hang on . Is that- - Amelia . She 's beautiful . Yeah . Facial recognition software ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . Uh , you got it , yeah . ( car revving , horn honking ) ( tires screeching ) You Kase ? You said 12 : 30 . You even allowed to drive ? Give me a hand , would you ? ( clearing throat ) It 's purely mechanical , right ? Good . ' Cause it has to be random . She can 't use electricity to influence the outcome in any way . She ? How much restoration does it need ? You want it or not ? ( sighs ) Here . For your college fund . Adios . ( engine starts and revs ) Hey , hey ! Wait ! How am I supposed to get this thing home ? ( horn honks ) Our American era has so little in common with the Old Testament . We 've devolved into micro-communities , addicted to local news and Facebook status updates . Avram would have us all throw away our computers ... - Yeah . - ... in the trash . You underestimate the-the power of human connection , my friend . - Ah . GUILLERMO : - Excuse me ? Are you Avram ? Yes . How may I help you ? I 'm looking for information on Jake Bohm . Jake Bohm ? Why would you ask me such a question ? I know you worked with his friend , Dr. Teller , so , I thought you might be in a position to help . I 'll catch up . - You sure ? - Go . What business do you have with Jake ? I know that you are part of a group that tracks the Righteous 36 . And he is one of them . How could you possibly know this ? I , too , have been studying them . Enough to know they are in danger . I 'm sorry . I can 't help you . I know nothing of Jake Bohm 's whereabouts . If you change your mind , I 'm staying at the Middleton Hotel . Room 5991 . Avram ? Who was that ? An enemy of the 36 . ( phone beeps ) Come on , Jake . Pick up . Pick up , Jake . Please . ( phone ringing , children chattering ) This one 's so cute . But who on earth would name a bunny Cujo ? They 're vegetarians , not carnivores . I mean , come on . You 're cool , you know that ? You smile at me a lot . And you 're a really good listener . What 's wrong ? Hey , where did Fluffy go ? Fluffy 's missing ! Has anyone seen Fluffy ? Wait outside . Go ahead . Open them . I 've already tried that number . - Calvin left it on his whiteboard . - There 's more . ( beeps ) Good . Download all his files onto his laptop . That gives him what he wants . I want you to bring his computer back to him , tell him it worked . I 'll be back in three minutes . ( beep ) Make sure he doesn 't leave . ( computer trills , beeps ) ( whispering ) : Adeline Danvers . Adeline Danvers . ( beep ) Date of birth , April 11 , 1998 . ( panting ) LUCY : Hey . ( typing ) I 'm at BreakWire . I found two re victims - who might match . - Amelia 's birthday- what is it ? - A-Amelia 's birthday ? - Why are you asking me ? - Please , just tell me what her birthday is . April 11 , 1998 . Did something happen with Calvin ? Yeah . I 'm looking at his Aster Corps files . He has several on Adeline Danvers . They have birthdate marked down as April 11 , 1998 . Here 's the kicker , these files are dated after Aster Corps lost her . You mean Calvin Norburg is the one who took her ? I think so . Hold on . Okay , I 've got travel itinerary . A Town Car picked up Calvin Norburg and Adeline Danvers at the board and care facility in New York , took them to JFK , where they flew from New York to Los Angeles just over three weeks ago ; the timeline fits . Then that 's proof ! Calvin Norburg has my daughter . Stay at BreakWire . I 'll get there as soon as I can . Our interaction remains anonymous . - We 've never met before . - Agreed . ( computer beeping ) - Are you finished yet ? - Almost . You have three minutes to evacuate - the building . - I 'll let myself out . ( birds chirping nearby ) There are four new numbers . 5991 . What do they mean ? Why did you add them to the larger number ? It 's not something you could understand . Try me . The numbers define the recurrence relation of interconnecting parallel and distributed systems- - systems that strive for beauty and completeness , that permeate all structures , forms and proportions , whether cosmic or individual , organic or inorganic , acoustic or optical . The magnetic resonance of the spins in cobalt niobate crystals proves their existence at the atomic scale . But I believe the proportions are evident in human genome DNA . The systems appear in recognizable biological settings , too , like the branching in trees , phyllotaxis , and the fruit sprouts of pineapples . Thank you . Why don 't I go to school ? Got it . You ready ? Ready to roll . Okay , well done . I know you know how much my son appreciates what you 're doing , but I want you to know , I do , too . ( keyboard clacking ) This won 't frighten her , - will it ? - Come on . How long have you known me , - Mrs. N ? - That 's what worries me . ( quietly ) : But why do you need the game ? The pachinko machine 's completely random , meaning it involves no skill ; she actually - has to do it . - Do what ? Predict the future . What 's that ? It 's her brain . The radioactive contrast I just gave her works with the X-ray tomography to convert her neurological pathways into binary code . Okay . The flipper releases the balls . Before they go up , I want you to call out jackpot one through three , side pocket one through seven , or bottom exit . - Got it ? - Got it . And begin . Jackpot 3 . Jackpot 1 . Jackpot 3 . Bottom exit . Bottom exit . Jackpot 3 . KASE : And again . Go . Jackpot 1 . Jackpot 3 . Right pocket . AMELIA : Pocket 4 . AMELIA : Jackpot 1 . Pocket 6 . KASE : And again . Go . Jackpot 2 . Pocket 3 . Pocket 6 . Jackpot 1 . Jackpot 3 . Jackpot 2 . Side pocket 6 . Side pocket 8 . Side pocket 4 . Side pocket 1 . Isn 't that enough ? Okay , you can stop . Cray , 68 % . Amelia , 91 % . Amelia ... beat the supercomputer ? No , Mrs. N. Amelia 's teaching a supercomputer . ( panting ) GIRL : Where is he ? ! This is all my fault . The teacher 's gonna kill me . Fluffy ? Fluffy ? ( girl panting ) GIRL : Fluffy ? Fluffy ? Fluffy ? Jake ! Everyone look ! Jake found him ! GIRL : Wait ! Stop ! I told you ! He doesn 't like to be touched ! Good job . ♪ ( kids chattering ) Were you successful ? Yes . My brother has the laundry service account at the Middleton Hotel . He knows of your mission and was happy to do this . He says it will open any room in the hotel . Tell your friend , and his friends , thank you . - B 'hatzlacha . - B 'hatzlacha . ♪ ♪ ( gasps ) ( door opens ) I see you changed your mind . You have a picture of Jake Bohm . Why ? Who are you ? My name is Guillermo Eduardo Ortiz , of the Jesuit order of the Instituto Filosófico Maria de Gracia . A priest . Yes . And I 'm on a mission of mercy . A mission ? What is the nature of this mission ? ( sighs ) Men of God have the duty to speak truthfully . Indeed . My mission is to rid the world of the 36 so the natural order of God can be restored . ( panting ) : But their very existence provides God the proof that the world is-is worthy of saving . These obituaries , these people , were killed ... randomly ... and senselessly . It was not random . You will not complete your mission . ( gasps ) If you stand in my way , you leave me no choice . Your mission is to kill the 36 . If you deviate from that plan , you are simply a godless murderer . No ! I am not a 36 . ( sighs ) Sustenance . Any luck ? Nope . I ran his face through every database known to mankind - and came up with nothing . - Maybe your bloke 's rotting away in a Siberian jailhouse . - There he is . - Trevor , I need to download some files fast . Can I get an external hard drive ? We need to talk . This is Calvin Norburg 's computer . - I got to get it back to him by 4 : 00 . - Okay . LUCY : That 's my daughter 's brain ? - Yeah . - Well , this is it . Right here , finally , proof we can take to the police . I told you , we can 't go to the police . The only proof that 's gonna matter to them is if we show up with Amelia alive . Besides , Calvin is so heavily guarded , if he sees anything out of the ordinary , he might move her . Or worse . I don 't care how big Aster Corps is , or Calvin Norburg , they don 't own the police . You really want to take that chance ? Please , Lucy , I know what I 'm doing . Just let me do this myself . Fine . I 'll just go home . Lucy . Lucy ! KASE : Veggie burgers and side salads . What , the cows go on strike ? ( sighs ) If I still want to be around when all this happens , I got to you know , eat healthier . She 's doing well . Very , very well . I know . Made me think of something today , something that happened a few weeks after we got Amelia away from Aster Corps and you brought her here to LA . There was another kid that Teller was working with in New York . His name was Jake Bohm . We were gonna bring him in , but some thugs Aster Corps hired blew it . His father grabbed him and ran . His scores are even higher than Amelia 's . Imagine if we had two of ' em . The progress would be exponential . Yeah . It would probably cut the time in half . Well , I was thinking maybe we could hire someone to find him again . Who 's this ? It 's Jake 's dad . Uh , he was a reporter for the New York Herald , went off the deep end after 9 / 11 . Why ? This is Martin Bishop . The guy that you met with this morning ? That 's why he wants to take down Aster Corps . They tried to grab his kid . You knew about this all along ? No . But it explains his obsession with the company . And with you . When are you gonna see him again ? In an hour . What are you gonna do ? ( sighs ) Excuse me . I 'd like to report a kidnapping . My daughter . Amelia 's her name . Amelia Robbins . This photo recent ? Uh , no , she 's-she 's 11 here . She 's now , God , 14 . She 's been gone almost three years . And this is the first you 're reporting it ? Uh , no , no , no , no . I 'm sorry . Let me backtrack here . My daughter is off-the-charts smart , but she would never talk , so I took her to New York to get treatment . That 's where you 're from ? Yes . And that 's where she disappeared . But now I 'm in Los Angeles looking for her . I don 't have a permanent address here , but I do know - who has her . - Who ? Calvin Norburg . H-He 's at the Culver City Gun Range right now . He has a ... a meeting in-in 15 minutes at 4 : 00 . Norburg . Is this a family friend ? - An ex ? - No . He is just some guy . Once you get him , I can explain everything , but right now I just need you to go now , please . Hang tight . I 'll be right back . Thank you . ( door opens ) ( door shuts ) You 'd shoot better if you kept your elbows in tight . You made it . Yeah . Security wasn 't as tough as we thought . All the files are on there ? Yeah . Couldn 't help but look at a few of them . The reporter in me . That 's impossible . The files are encrypted . Guess not . I was particularly interested in your research on a girl named Adeline Danvers . I was thinking of writing a story on why you 'd be studying her brain in the first place . Those numbers didn 't even exist yet . I figured them out mathematically . But your son ... he just handed ' em to you , didn 't he ? My son ? What are you talking about ? Jake . I know who you are , Martin Bohm . ( grunts ) You touch my son , I swear to God I will kill you . Now , I want Amelia back . Now . Then you have a serious choice to make . If anything happens to me or Amelia , anything , I promise you , Jake will be gone . I 'm surprised that you 'd let him go to a public school , Martin . ( door opens ) - Ms. Robbins ... - Uh , what 's taking so long ? We don 't have a lot of time here . I 'm sorry . This is Patricia Grimes . She 's with the Crisis - Intervention Unit . - Hello , Lucy . Hi . I don 't understand . We did some checking , Lucy . Your daughter died three years ago . You should 've asked me that before . It 's a lie . They faked my daughter 's death and they brought her to Los Angeles . The grieving process can be very complicated . - Especially when there 's a child involved . - Really ? You 're really gonna do this ? Sometimes there are delusions - like the ones you 're ... - No . No delusions . Um , I want to leave . Am I allowed to leave ? - Good . I 'm leaving . - If you change your mind ... No , I won 't change my mind . Jake ! Mr. Bishop ! You should 've seen Jake today . He found Fluffy , and the whole class thinks he 's a stud . And we 've been dating for , like , four hours . Wow . Oh , and guess what Ms. Herrera said . We 're both on chore duty again tomorrow , Jake . ( phone ringing ) - Bye ! - Jake . Your backpack 's ringing again . It 's Avram . He 's called over six times . Hello ? Martin , I-I met a man today named - Guillermo Ortiz . - Guillermo Ortiz ? Yes , h-he ... he had photos in his room o-of people who had been murdered- - each one special- - like Jake . Let me get a pen . Give me their names . Claudia Corliss , an astronomer from Santiago . Frederick LeMay , a composer in Brussels . And Rosemary Mathis , an architect from Barcelona . Frederick LeMay , Rosemary Mathis . - Martin , listen to me . - Jake , it 's all right , buddy . It 's gonna be fine . Okay . Yeah . There was ... another photo in this man 's room . It was a photo of Jake . Go on . Jake is in danger . This man , I believe , is coming for Jake . May I speak to Jake , please ? I-I just want to tell him that I 'm okay . Yeah . Hold on . It 's Avram . He wants to tell you something . I want to thank you , Jake . You knew that danger ... was headed my way . And yours . Take care of yourself . Avram , thank you . Jake , get in the car now . ( sighs ) ( steady beeping ) I got you , Calvin . Hey , Mom . ( thunder ) Go get ready for bed , okay ? I 'll be right in . ( sighs ) ( sighs ) Hey . Hey . Look , I know you were upset when you left . I ... I tried your cell phone . It was off . Why ? Did you find something ? No . To be honest with you , I was worried that you 'd gone to the ... To the police . No . I came straight here . So , what happened with Calvin ? Did he give you any more information about Amelia ? I-I got a call from Avram . His name is Guillermo Ortiz . You were right . He 's been killing people . Avram 's worried he 's coming after Jake . Oh . So-so what did Calvin say ? What did he tell you ? Tell me what he said . He ... he didn 't show . JAKE : And when these perfect storms hit , you have to recognize them for what they are . ( thunder rumbles ) I 'm sorry . Acknowledge their awesome power . And hold on tight .

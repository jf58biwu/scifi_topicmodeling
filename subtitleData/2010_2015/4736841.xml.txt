 My name is Alice . I worked for the Umbrella Corporation . The largest and most powerful commercial entity in the world . I was head of security at a secret high tech facility called the Hive ... a giant underground laboratory developing experimental viral weaponry . There was an incident ... the virus escaped . A lot of people died . Trouble was ... they didn 't stay dead . The computer that controlled the Hive was a state of the art artificial intelligence , the Red Queen . The Red Queen responded to the threat of the viral outbreak in an extreme way . She went homicidal . You 're all going to die down here . The Red Queen attempted to kill everyone whether they were infected or not . I managed to escape , but ... this was only the beginning . Viral outbreak spread like wildfire . First across the United States ... then the world . But the T virus didn 't just bring the dead back to life . It mutated them in terrifying ways . Despite the apocalypse they had created ... the Umbrella Corporation continued to experiment with the deadly virus . I was infected ... but the virus bonded with me on the cellular level . I developed powers . I became different . Powerful . Unstoppable . As I got stronger , the human race became weaker . I tried my best to lead what survivors I could find to safety , but we were pursued relentlessly . Even my friend Jill Valentine was seized and brainwashed by Umbrella . Finally I confronted the head of the Umbrella Corporation , Albert Wesker . He robbed me of my powers ... but I still managed to defeat him . At last ... we thought it was over . We thought we had survived the horror . But we were wrong . Once again ... we found ourselves fighting ... for our lives . Rise and shine . C 'mon babe . We 're late . The alarm didn 't go off . Becky 's not up yet . Ms. Anderson is gonna be pissed . You know how they get when we drop her off late at the school . Babe ? You all right babe ? Yeah . I 'll go get Becky . I charged your batteries for you . Becky ? You know Ms. Anderson ... she wants you to speak while you sign . Thank you daddy . When you come back from school ... I have a surprise for you . I heard that . The way these batteries are lasting less and less , we 'll need to get some new ones . Okay , well , I can pick some up on my way home . I 'm going to be late ... again . Ah Shit ! I 'll get you another shirt from the bedroom . Someone picked up your dry cleaning yesterday . You know you 're my little angel , aren 't you ? You 're going to be late , remember ? Oh , yeah . I 'll get you that shirt . Get Becky back ! Ahhh ! No ! Help ! Help Us ! C 'mon ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! No ! - Wait ! Wait ! - Stay back ! What the hell is wrong with you ? C 'mon get in the car ! - What 's going on ? - Your guess is as good as mine . - Why are these people doing this ? - Those things are not people . Not anymo- - Are you hurt ? Can you move ? Okay . C 'mon . Oh shit ! - Mommy , c 'mon ! - Go ! Project Alice ... why did you turn against Umbrella ? Jill ... is that you ? Project Alice ... why did you turn against Umbrella ? What happened to Chris and Claire ? Where are the others from the ship ? Project Alice ... who do you work for ? Project Alice ... who do you work for ? Jill ... why are you doing this ? ! Warning .

Scramble all security teams and sweep the corridor with the laser grid . Standby . Standby . Tokyo sequence initialized . Who , who broke in ? Standby . Standby . Welcome to Umbrella Central Control . Oh yeah . Don 't . - My name is- - - Ada Wong , operative for the Umbrella Corporation . One of Wesker 's top agents . I know exactly who and what you are . Now the real question is ... why don 't I just cancel your contract right now ? I don 't work for Umbrella anymore ... and neither does Albert Wesker . I don 't care . You can kill her if you like ... but then you 'll never get out of this place . - Wesker ! - Now be a good girl . Put down the knife . Oh and Alice ? How nice to see you again . - How did she get out ? - She 's obviously getting help . We have a traitor ... in this facility . The Security Systems were shut down for 2 minutes ma 'am . - What about control ? - We still can 't raise them . I executed everyone in this control room . I enabled Wesker to hack the mainframe . We shut down the Security Systems . We let you out of that cell . We have to get you out of this facility . So why do you want to help me ? We need you . The human race faces extinction . Our only hope for survival ... is for us to work together . I 'm not going anywhere until I know where we are and what the hell is going on here . You 're in the prime Umbrella testing facility . Explain Tokyo . What you saw was just a detailed recreation , nothing more . It goes on for a few city blocks . That 's all . - I was outside . - Were you ? - Saw the sky did you ? - It was night . Stars ? the Moon ? The testing floor is 300 feet high , the ceiling black . It 's usually night in there , but isn 't that when the monsters come out anyway ? It was raining . Climate control , wind , rain , they can even make it snow if they want to . Why build such a place ? Simple . The Umbrella Corporation derived it 's primary income from the sale of viral weaponry . Something that 's impossible to test in the real world . They recreated the center of New York , simulated an outbreak , showed it to the Russians and sold them the virus . They simulated an outbreak in Moscow ... sold it to the Americans . - An outbreak in Tokyo . - Sold it to the Chinese . - An outbreak in China . - Sold it to the Japanese . Exactly ! Everyone had to have it . The Umbrella Corporation built a new arms race . Only this time ... it was biological rather than nuclear . Highly profitable , and this is where it all happened . This is Umbrella 's greatest creation . The belly of the beast . So why don 't we just get the hell out of here ? Stop ! Sun up is in less than 1 minute . Why don 't you just see for yourself ? This facility is located in the straits of Kamchatka , Northern Russia . The old Soviet Union built submarine pens here in the 80s . After the Cold War ended , the Umbrella Corporation expanded them ... and built the testing floor . No one has ever escaped from this facility . Ice . You 'll need all the help you can get . So I 've arranged for a strike team to enter from the surface and assist you . There they are ... intake vents for the Umbrella facility . Looks abandoned . That 's what they want you to think . Let 's move ! We have just 2 hours to extract Alice and Ada . After that we can expect heavy Umbrella reinforcements . Running a bypass . These are the access codes Ada gave us . You trust her ? Just enter the numbers . The charges are set . We 're in . Let 's go do this . They 're in . The strike team has secured an elevator for your escape to the surface . They will eliminate Umbrella resistance , then rendezvous with us ... and escort us out They have a friend of yours with them . Luther West . He 's alive ? All right . Hold on ladies . Synchronize watches , 2 hours exactly in . 3 , 2 , 1 , Mark . Leon . Why don 't we just trigger the explosives remotely ? I can 't risk them jamming the signal . Whether we succeed or not , this facility has to be destroyed . What if we take longer than 2 hours ? Well then I hope you 're really good at holding your breath . Security Chief Valentine has reached the Tokyo test environment . She 's tracking you . They 're headed this way . Her orders are to recapture you if possible ... terminate you if necessary . Who 's giving these orders ? The Red Queen . The computer ? Yes . The same artificial intelligence you encountered in the Hive . She now controls what remains of the Umbrella Corporation . She will stop at nothing to prevent you escaping to the surface . I 've plotted an escape route for you . You 'll cross the New York environment to Suburbia ... where you 'll rendezvous with the strike team . They 'll escort you through the Moscow environment to the submarine pens . And take the elevator back to the surface . The Red Queen has intercepted my signal . She 's about to regain control of the facility . You must hurry . I can 't- - Don 't listen to the traitor Wesker . I am in control now . Project Alice . Ada Wong . Stay where you are . Let 's move . Project Alice . You 're all going to die down here . I 've heard that before . Defensive formation . Lock your targets . Fire at will . Submarine pens are up ahead . Barry . You and I take point . We rendezvous with Alice and Ada in 30 minutes . Clear ! Now that 's some hardware . Typhoon Class , the biggest nuclear subs the Soviets ever built . Umbrella used them to secretly transport bio weapons all over the globe . Let 's pick up the pace . We have less than 90 minutes . Intruders detected . Targeted for termination . New York . We need to cross 2 more test environments to escape . Let 's move . Why would Umbrella continue to run these tests ? They want to study the biohazard , learn how to control it . Initialize New York sequence . Activate biohazard . Standby . Standby . New York sequence initialized . The Red Queen . She 's activating bio weapons to stop us . Let 's go . Wait . You hear that ? You know what it is ? I have an idea . You 've got to be kidding me ! Hey boys . Bad idea . Let 's move . We 're behind schedule . What 's going on ? It 's the end of the sequence . They rarely last more than an hour . C 'mon . Before the Red Queen activates something else . Target survived . Security Chief Valentine to intercept . Intruders entering Moscow test environment . Activate Los Plagos undead . What 's going on ? The Red Queen knows we 're here . Keep your eyes open . Standby . Standby . Moscow sequence initialized . What ? Listen . Right there ! What the hell are those things ? Fall back ! Everyone fall back ! Clouds ? They 're not real . It 's a holographic projection . When they were running a simulation , trust me ... no one was looking at the sky . This is the rendezvous point . The strike team is late . Where are they ? Someone is in the house behind you . Upstairs window . Why would they be in here ? They 're using clones of me . Of course . You were one of the 50 basic models . Basic models . How do you think Umbrella populates these test scenarios ? Hundreds of people dead each time they run a simulation . Umbrella imprints them with basic memories . Just enough to ensure a correct emotional response ... to the threat of the biohazard . In one life she could be a suburban housewife . The next ... a businesswoman in New York . The next ... a soldier working for Umbrella . Mommy ! I hid like you told me . What happened to your clothes and your hair ? RPG ! Down ! We 're running out of time ! You have to find as a way out now ! Almost there ! None of this is real . It is to her . I know . That 's the point . All these feelings she has for you ... they were imprinted . A day ago , she was a blank slate . I could show you a dozen just like her in cold storage . I 'm sorry , but it 's true . Ready ! I was fast wasn 't I ? Yes you were . - Daddy ? - He 's not your father . Capture if possible . Terminate if necessary . There 's a child here . Your problem , not ours . All heart ... you haven 't changed a bit . I don 't know you lady . Now ... surrender or die . Stay down ! Advance ! In team ! You can 't stay here ! This will show you the way out . Go through Moscow to the submarine pens ! Take this ! The less I have with me , the better . Alpha team forward ! They 're coming . We have to hurry . Go ! I got it ! This way ! Hey . Wait . She helped us , don 't you remember ? You two made it . I thought I was the only one that survived . What is this place and why is everything in Russian ? And what 's with the SM Getup ? You know how to use this ? I campaigned ... for gun control . No , I don 't think you understand . I marched against the NRA . Concentrate . It 's just like a camera . Point ... and shoot . Congratulations ! You 're officially a bad ass . What the hell 's going on here ? I 'll explain when I get back . Right now you have to keep her safe . You stay with her . You 're going ? You said you wouldn 't leave . Trust me , Okay ? What I say is true . I 'll come back for you . You promise ? Trust me . I love you . Come on . She 'll be back for you . Gotta find a hiding place . I met your sister . - What ? - She 's not very nice . Let 's try hiding down here . - This way ! - Let 's move ! We can work our way around the- - Waiting for a written invitation ? Sweet ride . Well ... this is Moscow . I heard gunfire . I thought you might need some help . Where 's Ada ? I don 't think she made it . I 'm sorry . You saw her die ? No . She always has a plan . Boys ... you mind ? - Shall we ? - My pleasure . Let me know when you plan on doing that again . Heads up . Our little friend is back ! Oh Shit ! Almost there . Oh , wait , wait-wait-wait . What makes you think you can dive down there ? Everyone Okay ? Yeah ! Alright , let 's go . Hello ? You can come out ! I 'm back ! Where 'd you find these guys ? Who 's this ? I 'm Becky . Hi Becky . This is my mom . Your mom ? Oh ! Long story . 22 minutes left . There 's no going back the way we came . Yeah and we lost our map with Sergei . I 'm on it . We can take this tunnel . At the end there 's a service shaft that leads down to the submarine pens . Let 's go ! How 'd you end up working for Wesker ? I don 't work for him . The things on the surface have changed . Wesker said you knew of some weapon . Something I could turn the tide for us . But I don 't think I would 've risked so much for one person . You 're probably right . This way ! The submarine pens are up above us . C 'mon . Move ! The elevator platforms are up ahead . 11 minutes . - We 're gonna be Okay . - Hold on . 11 minutes . - We 're gonna be Okay . - Hold on . Accessing power grid . Dispatching biohazard . Everybody get onboard ! Hold on . Next stop ... menswear and sporting things . Move down ! Barry , what is it ? I don 't know . Where are you going ? Somebody must have cut the power remotely . Be strong . I 'm gonna keep you safe . Can you get it back online ? Not without the access codes . 9 minutes . Looks like we 're going with plan B. What ? There 's a reason we planted those explosives . No ! Mommy ! Mommy ! I feel like shit . She 's dead . What are you doing ? She 's alive . I 'm going to get her . I didn 't lose this many friends so you could just walk away . I plan on coming back . Don 't do this . You 're more important than she is . That 's where you 're wrong . This is a mistake . Get out of my way . Don 't leave without me Okay ? Are you kidding ? I 'm going with you . Don 't move , don 't move . It 's Okay . Go get her back . You like that ? ! Huh ? ! Fall back ! Fall back to the elevator ! You go ! I 'm gonna stay here awhile . Barry ! When the countdown gets to zero , you have to be on that elevator . Someone 's gotta stay here , Leon . Besides ... I 'm kind of enjoying myself ! Go . Go ! C 'mon ! Beck- - Becky . Go ! Bring out the prisoner ! Cease your firing ... or I 'll execute her . Now ... put down your guns ... step out . Step out or she dies ! Mommy , who are they ? Mommy , who are they ? Mommy , is that you ? You 're my mommy , aren 't you ? ! I am now . Run ! Choppers are on their way , so ... just sit back and relax . What 's going on ? What the hell is that ? - Becky , are you hurt ? - No , I 'm Okay . Told you she 'd have a plan . Only the two of you ? It 'll be enough . The Los Plagos parasite . Terminate Project Alice . Alice ! You can 't kill me . I don 't need to . I 'm coming for you ! Good luck with that . Leon . What is it ? It 's help . Glad to have you back . Glad to have you back . Wesker . I see you 've made yourself at home . Well I must say ... it does have a certain ease to it . What is this ? What have you done to me ? You were the only one to successfully bond with the T virus . To fully realize her powers ... well now I have need of you ... the old you . So I 've given you back your gift . You are the weapon . I 'm gonna kill you . Perhaps . But first you have work to do . The Red Queen is determined to destroy all life on earth . This is the last that remain of us , of the human race . It seems we 're bonded against a common foe . This is why we needed you back ... the ultimate weapon . This is humanity 's last stand ... the beginning of the end .

 The last fragment of a once living planet . Its body blasted into dust by the madness of its own inhabitants . While its head was cursed to roam aimlessly through time and space screaming in pain and sorrow . In legend and in fact , it is known as Metal Hurlant . Allright , Joe . Moment of truth . You get in , you get rich , and you get out . That 's all you 're gonna do . Then you can shove that last container up your boss ' ass . Let 's do it . Another human who wants to make me lose time . Speak quick . I 'm sorry . I apologize , okay ? It was completely my fault . Humans . Give me some bull vodka and tell me who can make my day . Well first , let me serve you right . - So ? - So ? The one you 've been looking for would be- - Little miserable gambler , you . Take your small victory and leave this bar right now or I 'll make sure my men will make you smile forever . That 's him . Xero Trobe . But beware . I think he 's been having a bad day . That birdy guy from earlier apparently made his day miserable . Yeah ? Well , he hasn 't met me yet . Heard you might be looking for some real competition . Well , well , well . How far are you ready to go ? All the way . Believe me . I hate small players . Hey , guys . Get the table ready . Looks like I could still have a bit of fun today . Check . All in . You 're bluffin ' , space trucker . Oh , I ain 't bluffing ' , Xero . I 'm bettin ' my eyes . That 's what I wanted to hear . Now yours . You bet your freighterin ' ass on that handful of junk ? Can we work something out , guys ? Huh ? Aah ! Quarter million per eye . I can get it I can get it just need a little more time , okay ? You get one day . One day ? His eyes are gonna look great . Rotting in my head . Okay , Joe , what are you gonna do ? You can make a run for it . Make a fresh start , or ... Screw it . Hell of a day . All right . Who wants to party with big Joe ? Not you . Anybody else ? How about you ? You in the mood for love , darling ? Not really . Okay , so , you in the mood for work ? Now you 're getting more interesting . Follow me . So you must really like your job . Do you enjoy it ? Must be kind of a pain in the ass , though , Sometimes , right ? Well , it depends on who the f * ck is getting it in . And people usually ask me for it . Oh , don 't worry . I 'm not into that kind of thing . So , you like gentle and submissive girls that can take care of your little prince , that 's better than ... You know . Boring . Come on , I 'll get you Charity . She 's young and nice . She 'll be more like your type . Hey , wait a minute . You don 't get to tell me who I screw . Well , looks like there 's a big man finally in that room . Baby , you ain 't seen nothing yet . Happens to everyone , right ? Nope . Great . Xero Trobe 's gonna harvest my eyeballs . I lost my money . My freighter 's gone . You have a ship ? Used to have a ship . Let 's go get it . I 'm not so sure about this . Relax . I have a map to a pirate ship . A pirate ship ? You mean , with treasure ? Take that , and you 'll see . Whoa , how much treasure are we talking about here ? Enough to buy your way out of anything . Where did you say you got the map ? From a dead ... From a client . You know , before we go anywhere , we 're gonna deal with this guy . Nice . Put the auto-map disk into the- - Yeah , I know how it works , sweetheart . But we got to escape first . Sit down . All right . I 'm going . Hey , what the ... He 's getting out ! Catch me that bastard ! Do something ! Send your fighters right away ! If I don 't have the money or my eyes , at least I will get him shred to pieces . Fighter two , three , five , and seven , you 're clear for launch . Now I 'm gonna enjoy that . If you 're as good a pilot as a card player , then I 'm sure to be the winner . Come on . You 're my cheerleader . You 're the best , Xero . You can do it ! I want him dead . These guys really want me dead . This is just my usual luck . Watch them ! What do you think I 'm doing , honey ? Besides , we got bigger problems . The navigator 's supposed to be programmed before we reach the jumpgate . Tell those damn fighters that I will self-destruct their ship right away if I don 't get what I want , and I mean it . Three new assholes in this damn Joe Mada . Where 's the A.M.D. taking us ? Damn it . What ? No man 's land ? Oh , you gotta be shitting me . We have to . The treasure 's there . Goodbye , Mada . I 'll eat your heart for dinner . Oh , Xero , you 're so strong . You are my champion . You never said anything about no man 's land . You never asked . Who am I trying to kid ? Like I even had a choice . All right . Here we go . Got a little present for you , my friends . Evade ! Madaaaaa- - aaaaaaa- - aaaaaaa- - aaaaaaa ! Give me a " x . " Give me a " e . " Give me a " r . " Give me a " o . " - Xero ... - Shut up ! No one 's ever made it back from no man 's land before . You know that , right ? Don 't be such a baby . We made it . What the Hell is this ? Oh my god . Okay . This is bad . The ship 's not gonna be able to take much more of this . There it is . There , a dock pad . That 's never gonna work . Strap on a pair and get to that ship . Fine . All right . Let 's do it . How do you know where you 're going ? I know it . Trust me . Wait . You hear that ? There it is . I 'm rich ! I 'm rich ! Whoa , sweetheart . - We 're both rich . - That 's what I meant . I think we 've broke the orbital pattern of the ship by docking on it . Quick ! We gotta reset it ! The orbit is broken , and the black hole is ... Yeah yeah , whatever . I can correct it by using max engine power to try to put the ship back on course . Hang on ! Go go , we can make it . Not gonna happen . It 'll pull the engine right off . We don 't have enough power , damn it . Come on ! What 's happening ? I don 't know ! I can 't believe we made it . I can 't believe I 'm still in one piece . Yeah , great . You 're in one piece . What is this place ? I don 't know . What is this place ? It 's like ... A different world . Hey , what 's that ? We shouldn 't go over there . Why not ? I got a bad feeling about this .

 [ Wind blowing ] [ Ticks ] Heil Hitler . [ Speaking German ] [ Speaking German ] [ Clatter ] [ Gunfire , shells exploding ] [ Cackles ] Uhh ! Aah ! [ Cocks pistol ] [ Blade scrapes ] Yaah ! [ Wind blowing ] Niflheim station , do you read me ? [ Rock music playing ] Niflheim , do you copy ? [ Turns down music ] This is niflheim . That you , mark ? Yes . Hey , it 's me . We 've set up site n-417 And are preparing to core . Over . All right , we got you on the map . Over . Hey , may , when I get back , Do you maybe want to share a cup of coffee ? Yeah , like we do As our usual routine ? Over . Right . Like usual . We 'll check in again in 30 . Over . All right , mark . Stay warm . Over . Right . Over and out . Damn , it 's cold . It 's summer in February . Imagine spending a winter here . Can 't believe you 've done that . Antarctica is the new frontier for medical research . Do you have any idea what it 's like To find an 8-million-year-old Now let 's see what kind of nasties we find . [ Engine starts ] [ Creaking ] Stop ! Stop it ! Stop ! We 've hit metal . What the hell ? [ Footsteps in snow ] [ Paige screams ] Don 't touch her ! Mark ! [ Speaking German ] [ High-pitched whine ] Where do you want these bug samples , Dr. moss ? By the autoclave . Where did you get this ? Dr. reistad . Where the 3 molecular phenotypes of the hemoglobin Are detectable through electrophoresis . Can I have a word with you ? [ Sighs ] I 'm in the middle of a demonstration . Can it wait ? No . Please excuse me . What happened ? What is this ? Vibrio vulnificus . I know what it is . I want to know what it 's doing here . What 's the problem , doctor ? Heh . Exposed this station to flesh-eating bacteria ? [ Clock ticking ] [ Muffled yelling ] Whoa . He looks pissed . This is unacceptable . [ Yelling contines ] Which one ? Any day of the week . Hey , silje , is it really true That reistad gave himself When he was stranded here alone over winter ? Well , he does have a scar down there . How do you know that ? [ Giggles ] And I 'm not going to allow you to pull another stunt Like you did 3 summers ago . You infected your entire team with influenza Just to see how quickly the virus would spread in a closed environment . You very well know That that experiment led to the discovery of a vaccine That saved thousands of people . Look , you already hold the dubious distinction Of losing more personnel Than any other station chief In the history of this project . Dr. moss , Antarctica is a very dangerous place . Until you 've lived here for 10 years ... Then you can start telling me how to do things . I am the iso , And we are going to follow a.T.S. Protocols . You are not going to lose anyone on my watch . Paige and mark . What ? They haven 't checked in . Paige ! Mark ! Paige ! Mark ! What happened ? Generator explosion ? There 'd be wreckage . He 's right . Paige ! Dr. reistad . Yeah ? It 's blood . Look ! Hey , footprints ! Those look like ... Like drag marks . Okay , everyone back in the snowcat . I 'll stay on foot . [ Heart beating ] Paige : Mark . Mark . Mark . Thank God you 're okay . Has the bleeding stopped ? [ Water dripping ] Yeah . It 's stopped . Good . That 's good . Who are these guys ? Soldiers ? Military exercises are prohibited in Antarctica . Why are they wearing ... [ Buzzer sounds , door opens ] Who are you ? Why are you doing this ? [ Gasps ] Paige ! Mark ! Where are you taking him ? Mark ! Dr. reistad : Well , he 's determined . I 'll give him that . But would he be doing this If it wasn 't Dr. Morgan ? I think it 's romantic . Yeah . [ Chuckles ] [ Door clatters ] Mark : What have you done to me ? I can 't move . Who 's there ? Who are you ? What do you want ? Stop . What are you going to do ? No . What are you doing ? Stop . What are you doing ? [ Shudders ] No . Stop . No . Please . Oh , God . Aah ! Oh , no . [ Gasping ] Oh , God . Oh , no . Oh , God . God . Oh , God , no . Please . I want to go home . I want to go home . I want to go home . Please , stop . Oh , God . Don 't . Please . No . No . Oh , God . No . Oh , God , no . No , no , no . No , don 't . Please . [ Screaming ] [ Screams echoing ] I need a rope ! Whew . What are you doing ? Tracks end here . It 's too dangerous . I have to . You 'd do it for silje . Okay . Give me some slack . Ah . You don 't want to forget this . Thanks . You said I couldn 't lose anybody on my watch . [ Laughs ] Why is it blue ? Silje : It 's not . It 's clear . What ? We are 50 feet below the surface . The ice you see is clear , But the water behind it is blue . That 's the ocean . I feel a warm breeze . Hey , guys , it 's warmer than it should be . The heat 's coming from the tunnel down there . I 'm ready to go . Dead end . [ Buzzer sounds , door opens ] [ Water dripping ] [ Motor whirs ] [ Clatter ] Mark . Mark . Everything 's gonna be okay . [ Gasping ] Help . Help ... Me . Help . [ Moaning ] [ Gasping ] Help . Hel ... help me . Help me , Paige . Uhh ! [ Speaking German ] [ Screams ] What are you doing ? I 'm going on . No . You have no idea how deep that shaft is . If the pressure doesn 't kill you , it could drop you Into the ocean below . Paige is down there . You don 't know that . There 's no other way . All right . There 's 100 feet of rope . If you don 't signal by the time Okay . All right . You understand ? Yeah . Okay . Good luck to you . Rope . Got it ? Yeah . Give me slack . Keep your weight back . There you go . Looking good . Looking good . 50 . Dr. reistad : 75 . And 100 . Doc ! Wait ! [ Rope creaks ] Oh ! [ Rope whips ] Oh , my God . Lucas ! Did he fall ? He unclipped it . Lucas ! Lucas ! Silje : Are you okay ? Rahul , hammer a piton into the ice , and tie off your end . I 'm going in after him . I 'll go . Wait , no . Hey , you sure about this ? I 'm lighter . We wouldn 't be able to pull you both up . If everything 's fine at the end of the rope , I 'll pull three times . You sure ? [ Speaking norwegian ] [ Laughing ] [ Laughter echoes ] Dr. reistad , echoing : Be careful . Lucas ! Lucas ! What the hell . [ Screaming ] [ Stops screaming ] [ Gasps ] Lucas . Lucas . Dr. moss . My God . That 's what I said . [ Slow footsteps ] [ Blade scrapes ] The infections on your men 's faces , Have you tried using prednisolone To counteract mismatched hlas ? Is it more effective than csa ? Cyclosporin is still effective , But the scope of allergenic transplantation Means you 're probably dealing with You are a doctor ? Mic ... Yes , I 'm a doctor . And you 've had better results Using corticosteroids ? Better than calcineurin inhibitors , But not as effective as atgs . I am not familiar with this treatment . The succesful use of polyclonal anti-t-cell antibodies Is relatively recent . What is the source of the immunoglobulin ? Rabbits , usually . Sometimes horses . [ Speaking German ] You are of German descent ? Yes . [ Speaking German ] Tell me everything you know about cmi . Dr. reistad : My God , it 's true . For centuries , people have been Talking about worlds within the hollow earth . 18th century writers called it agharta . It isn 't possible . You 're looking at it . Dr. reistad : During the second world war , This part of Antarctica was occupied by Germany . Hitler actually sent expeditions down here Looking for the supposed entrance to agharta at the South pole . Some people say that this is the site Of secret submarine bases . Some people say that this is the center of Nazi ufo research . I 'm sorry . How do you know all this ? You hear things . Come on . Let 's find Paige and mark . One extreme to the other . Heat and moisture , The elements of life , my man . It was from an environment like this That the very first prehistoric microbes emerged . Come on . We 're almost there . We don 't know what we 're dealing with . We don 't know who or ... or what lives in those buildings . Microbes didn 't build them . You hope . No , it 's fine . You 're right . Safer if you stay here . Paige and mark are our friends , too . We 've come this far , And I 'm just not going to ... Hey , silje , you okay ? It 's okay . Just a little faint . It 's the heat . Here . Here . Have some water . Have a little more . I 'm okay . Really , it 's nothing . Why does this look familiar ? Because it was built by humans . No , that 's not it . [ Clanking ] [ Footsteps marching ] You have kept your word , Dr. reistad . Heil Hitler . What is this ? This isn 't the first time I 've been here . 10 years ago , when I was working the very same site , I was caught and brought here to neuschwabenland . That was the first time I met Dr. Josef Mengele . Mengele . Who ? Dr. Josef Mengele , The angel of death , Butcher of Auschwitz . Mengele died in the seventies . That 's right . Unicamp exhumed his skull in Brazil . They confirmed it with his DNA . I was 61 years old , Suffering from debilitating arthritis And chronic osteoporosis , But I survived by replacing Almost 60 % of my endoskeleton ... Which in turn stopped my decaying health And kept the world from looking for me . That 's not possible . Oh , my dear doctor ... Dr. reistad : Moss . Dr. moss . You have no idea what is possible Once science is liberated from emotion And so-called ethics . You mean torturing and murdering innocent people . You must be Dr. blechman ... A Jew . No . I 'm ... I 'm not religious . Lucas : No ! [ Screams ] When the war ended ... The Americans and Russians Rushed to detain our scientists and doctors And use them for their own purpose , But I managed to liberate the most brilliant minds Of the fatherland myself . The most important scientific advances Of the twentieth century Are based on German ingenuity . Over the last 60 years , We 've made technical advances That the deviant , zionist west Could only dream about . But there is one task left . We prepare to take back our rightful place As the masters of this world . There are not many of us left . We 've been replacing vital organs , Recycling them over the years , Replacing brittle bones With more permanent materials . Dr. reistad here kept himself alive By agreeing to deliver a constant stream Of quality suitable replacement parts . Adrian ? Dr. Mengele : Don 't worry . You have been brought here For a different reason . Dr. reistad tells me That you are all leaders in your fields of research , The best of the best . You are here ... To keep us alive ... The rise ... The coming ... Of the thousand-year reich . I 'll never help you . So be it . Paige : Wait . Paige . [ Gasps ] We can help them , Or we can die . Relax , Lucas . We 're not going anywhere . You heard what they 're planning . We get back to niflheim . We contact McMurdo . Then what ? There 's no military base in Antarctica . There 's an air force base in Auckland . Would you stop that ? ! We are not getting out of here . We have got to do something ! What can we do ? Silje : We 're just doctors . Someone 'll do something . You see what happened to Aaron ? We need to save ourselves . Rahul is right . We should do what we 're ordered And try to survive , Just like Dr. reistad and ... and Paige . May : Lucas , there 's nothing we can do . This is how it happens . Isn 't it ? [ Water dripping ] Evil men triumph when good men do nothing . Fine . I 'll play along . I 'll wait for a chance ... But I won 't do nothing . We 're all gonna die , aren 't we ? Paige ! May : Mark ! Oh , my God , are you okay ? That 's not mark . [ May gasping ] Stay away from her . Dr. Mengele : Stop ! This laboratory is the result Of my decades of research In genetics and organ transplantation . Everything I have learned , You will find in these files . Everything necessary ... To prolong and improve the Aryan race ... Can be found in here . Yet , all my efforts ... Have been ephemeral . Gvhd . You need mtor inhibitors . Yes . Dr. Morgan already suggested this . It proved to be ... Imperfect . That 's because it isn 't a rejection issue . That 's the problem with theoretical research . It may very well be acute rejection , but ... The issue here ... Is a nosocomial infection . There . Now if the patient and his doctors Can keep their hands away From the surgical wound without protection , The antibiotics should do the trick . You were right , Dr. reistad . He may be useful after all . But time ... Is still our enemy . I will leave you to your work . Hi . Hey . How 's it going ? [ Scoffs ] Not so well . Thought you might need this . [ Buzzer sounds ] Herren , come with me . Damen , go with him . And take off your coats ! What 's going on ? We want to stay together . You will be together very soon . Lucas . Where are you taking them ? [ Speaking German ] They 're only going to the showers . [ Snorts ] Go . [ Door clang echoes ] [ Woman vocalizing ] Ausziehen . Strip . No . Nice . No ! Leave her alone ! Stop ! Leave her alone ! Just get off of her ! Angela ! No ! [ Crying ] [ Blade clicks ] Angela ! No ! Oh , my God . Dr. reistad . Thank God . What do you think you 're doing , may ? Huh ? What were you and Lucas talking about ? Don 't you understand The world has no idea Of the juggernaut that 's about to be unleashed on it . The only way for us to survive Is to align ourselves with the Victors . Ja . This one . Take her to the operating room . What ? Stop ! No ! No ! I 'm sorry . [ Gasps ] May ! [ May screams ] May ! Stop ! No ! No ! No ! Stop ! [ Screaming fades ] You did the right thing , silje . Let 's go . Angela : No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! [ Sobbing ] [ Door closes , sobbing stops ] [ Gasping ] Silje . Silje , are you okay ? Silje . Where are Angela and may ? Come on . Come on . [ Wheels rattling ] Oh , my God . Come on . You are about to witness history . [ Wheels squeak ] May . Dr. reistad , your assistance , please . Reistad , you 're a doctor . How could you do this ? I honestly don 't know Everything we know about the effects Of freezing on the body Were obtained by human experiments Almost exclusively at dachau and Auschwitz . Yet you have no misgivings about treating The effects of hypothermia . What 's the difference ? Reistad , get on with it . Remove him . [ Machinery whirring ] [ Whirring slows , stops ] You said it would work ! I said it should . You said ... The stem cells were the key ! That was only the first time we 've tried this . [ Gagging ] What is wrong with you ? You 're never squeamish . [ Sobs ] I 'm not . I 'm pregnant . Why didn 't you tell me ? You would have sent me home . Oh , min elskede . I 'm so sorry . [ Gasps ] [ Grunting ] Adrian ? [ Sobbing ] Adrian . Aah ! [ Sobs ] Are you sure this will work ? Nothing is certain in science , But the regenerative properites of fetal stem cells Have been well documented . Silje : Adrian . [ Speaking norwegian ] [ Sobbing ] Oh , please don 't kill our baby . [ Sobbing ] What are we waiting for ? [ Screaming ] [ Suction ] Don 't kill our baby ! [ Screaming ] [ Screams echoing ] [ Dripping ] Hurry . [ Machinery whirring ] [ Gasps ] Doktor ... Mengele . Why do they have us out here ? They killed Angela and may . Executions . Something 's going on . Fuck ... Sieg heil ! Sieg heil ! Sieg heil ! Sieg heil ! Sieg heil ! Sieg heil ! Sieg heil ! Sieg heil ! Sieg heil ! Sieg heil ! Sieg heil ! Sieg heil ! Sieg heil ! Sieg heil ! Sieg heil ! [ Cheering ] [ Engine roaring ] Your services are no longer required . Dr. reistad , Dr. Morgan , Prepare for surgery . [ Gasping ] Paige . Please . I understand you have feelings for Dr. moss , But there is no place for sentimentalities here . We are about to start a new world order Where only the strong will survive . It has begun . Paige ! We must act quickly , The direct sunlight exposure Paige , you are pleased with his physical appearance . I understand that , But he is not our blood . But he can be . As you can see , I am in need of new flesh . Lucas ' flesh will be my flesh . He will become me . No ! And we will be together , You and I , Side by side . Leaders of the glorious fourth reich . Paige ! Listen to me ! Stop this ! I 'm sorry . Lucas . [ Groaning ] I thought I 'd lost you . Never . Right . We have to find Brian . Let 's go . Lucas . [ Groans ] No . No , please , please . Please , stop . Please stop ! Silje , help me . Please . Dr. reistad , What are you doing ? Please . What are you doing ? ! Please . Please . [ Clang ] Silje . Come on . We have to go . No . Let 's go . Come on . Lucas , watch out ! [ Speaking German ] Paige . Stop ! [ Gasping ] [ Coughing ] This isn 't yours . [ Screaming ] [ Gurgling ] We 've got to get off this ship . Not that way . Reistad went that way . Let 's go . [ Instruments beeping ] R-n-zed-a-f base , this is sq-5 . Copy . Eqc report unusual seismic activity in your quadrant . Coordinates are 26 degrees west by 33 South . Copy that . R-n-zed-a-f base , We 'll check it out . Wait ! This way . This way . I know this area . We need to get mark . Mark . Mark . [ Coughing ] We 're gonna get you out of here . No . Kill ... Me . No . No . Please . Lucas . Kill me . No . No . Not like that . Thank you , doctor . [ Sobbing ] Come on . [ Rays blasting ] Shit ! [ Instruments beep ] Captain , I 'm getting m.A.D. Readings That show a magnitude-8 seismic event At target coordinates . That 's one big earthquake . Sir , there 's something still down there . Let 's see what it is . Shit a brick ! Adrian , no . Reistad ! Wait ! R-n-zed-a-f base Auckland , This is sq-5 . We have visual contact With an unidentified flying object . This thing is huge . Sq-5 , this is Auckland base . We read your ufo . Is target hostile ? Target is covered in Nazi swastikas . I 'm calling it hostile . Damn it , reistad ! There must be another way out of here . I think I saw some other doors down the hall . Sq-5 , you are clear to engage target . Fco , prepare to launch mavericks . [ Rays blasting ] What now ? Stairs . What ? Stairway ! Go ! I 'll cover you ! Report . Negative . All missiles destroyed . That 's impossible . Disengage . We are under attack . Damn it ! What ? I 'm out . No . No way . Go . Go . Hey ! [ Equipment powering down ] E.M.P. ! We 've lost all power ! Avionics are not responding . Mayday ! Mayday ! Mayday ! Mayday ! [ Crew screaming ] [ Laughs ] Guys , over here ! [ Instruments beep ] Wait . The other Americans are escaping . [ Yells ] [ Grunts ] [ Grunting ] Aah ! [ Gurgles ] [ Yelling ] [ Body falls ] The flesh-eating bacteria , That 's what reistad was doing . They 're putting it in the bombs . They 're going to infect the planet . We have to stop them . How ? Hey , what does this mean ? Paige : " Rettungsboote . " Lifeboats . Thank God . [ Door opens ] Come on . [ Gasps ] Run . U.S.S. Ronald Reagan , this is hornet leader one . We have visual contact with target . Hornet leader one , you are free to engage . [ Speaking German ] [ Bullets ricocheting ] Destroy ' em all . We have to run for it . I love you . [ Robot limbs whirring ] [ Bullets ricochet ] Paige ! Hey ! [ Speaking German ] You were supposed to leave me . Never . Let 's go now . [ Chuckles ] Adrian . [ High-pitched whine ] [ No audible dialogue ] [ Shivering ] [ Whirring ] You 've gotta be fucking kidding me . Plan ? Yes . And ? I 'm working on it . Run ! Paige , plan ? Still working on it .

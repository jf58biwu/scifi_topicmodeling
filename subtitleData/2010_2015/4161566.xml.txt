 [ Dr. Nicholas Rush ] : I may be on the verge of discovering the true nature of Destiny 's mission . [ Eli Wallace ] : You 've had control of this ship the whole time ! Why wouldn 't you tell anyone ? [ Camile Wray ] : The Lucian Alliance is planning an attack on Earth . [ Colonel Everett Young ] : I killed Riley . I suffocated him with my own hands . [ Lieutenant Matthew Scott ] : You are a good commander . [ Young ] : There is no mission other than getting these people home . [ Rush ] : It was never about going home . It 's about getting us to where we 're going . That is the mission . [ Scott ] : This is Varro , one of our remaining Alliance guests . [ Varro ] : I haven 't seen you in a while . [ Lieutenant T.J. Johansen ] : Your kidneys are failing . End-stage renal disease . The only other option for treatment would be a transplant . [ Sergeant Ronald Greer ] : You won 't reject it . [ Dr. Dale Volker ] : Great , no pressure . [ T.J. ] : There may be a little infection setting in there . [ Greer ] : I 'm fine . Eli , what the hell did you do ? Goodbye . [ Eli ] : I transferred the memory where they were stored into quarantine . They 're cut off from the rest of the ship now , and us . That 's what I did , to save you . [ Scott ] : Wow . Space deer . [ Chloe Armstrong ] : They 're beautiful . [ Greer ] : They 're going to look even more beautiful slow-roasted and served up with a side of Becker 's mash . You 're not serious . Uh , and how exactly would you cook ' em ? I wouldn 't . I 'm a vegetarian . No ... For the past 10 months , we have all been vegetarian . I am dying for a steak . I could use a steak . No , you guys can 't kill those creatures , and this has nothing to do with being a vegetarian . I mean , we don 't know anything about them . They could be intelligent . We just saw one of them eat its own vomit . How smart can they be ? Guys ! I could use some help over here . Okay , look , I 'll tell you what , if they can give me one good reason why I shouldn 't eat them , I won 't , but it better be a good one , because I am mighty hungry . Lieutenant ? Let 's do it . Not cool . Want me to take it ? No . No ... I got it . Damn ! What the heck happened ? [ Sighs ] Something must 've spooked ' em . We 've got plenty of time . Want to go after ' em ? Hell , yeah . [ Snarl of a large beast ] What was that ? Hang on . [ Beeps on Kino remote ] [ Beeping ] [ Rifle clatters ] [ Beast snarling ] Shoot ! Shoot it ! [ Beast snarling and growling ] ♪ Stargate Universe 2x16 ♪ The Hunt Original Air Date on April 11 , 2011 = = sync , corrected by elderman = = [ Beast snarling ] Shoot it ! [ Beast snarling ] It 's heading for the camp ! By the time we got there , it was gone . Was anybody hurt ? No fatalities , but plenty of injuries , and two missing . Reynolds and T.J. Permission to go after them , sir . Permission denied . Sir , I know things may look bad , but there is still a chance that T.J. and Reynolds could be alive down there . Which is why we need to find them as fast as possible . I 'm going to need you here , Lieutenant . While I 'm gone , you 're in charge . You got a problem with that ? No , sir . [ Crate slides heavily ] Hey ! What are you doing ? Checking to see what 's inside . Why , what does it look like I 'm doing ? Come on . I thought the whole point of exploring unexplored sections of the ship was to , well , explore them . We are . [ Scoffs ] Not really . Well , what can I say ? Rush wants us to take a cautious approach . Who cares what Rush thinks ? He 's not our boss . [ Scoffs ] You tell him that . I will . No , you won 't . I am not afraid of him . Afraid of whom ? Who . I think it 's " who . " " Afraid of who . " Afraid not . [ Awkwardly ] Hey ... What 've we got here ? This is one of the last rooms in this section . I 'm guessing more ancient containers . I want to see them rescued as much as anyone , but we have to consider the possibility that they may already be dead . We swept the area . If they were dead , why didn 't we find the bodies ? Maybe the creature dragged them away , took them somewhere it wouldn 't be disturbed . Neither of them are responding to radio communications . Maybe they 're unconscious , their radios were lost or damaged , I don 't know . All I 'm saying is , we can hope for the best as long as we 're prepared for the worst . You 're right . Why don 't you guys meet us at the gate ? You mind , uh , telling me what happened back there on the planet ? You had the shot , and you didn 't take it . Why not ? I don 't know . If it was a moment of indecision , just one of those things , then you can drop it , but if there is a problem , you need to find out what it is , and you need to fix it . Fast . Yes , sir . Stasis pods ? Yeah . Obviously designed for lengthy intergalactic journeys . We 've got multiple rooms exactly like this one going both ways . It 's fascinating . That 's a bit of an understatement . This is huge . Agreed . Okay , let 's leave it for now . Let 's go . What ? You can 't be serious . Well , given recent events , it may be wise to check over the ship 's data on this compartment before proceeding . Sergeant , hold up . I think we lost its trail . We should double back . Well , we need to keep moving forward . No , not if we 're headed the wrong way . Back the way we came is the wrong way . We keep moving forward , we 'll pick up the trail again . Trust me . All right , you guys check out the area , see if you can spot any tracks . Sergeant . What 's up ? We 're up against the clock here , sir . Which is why we can 't afford to make any more mistakes . Listen to me , I know this is tearing you apart , but what 's done is done , and you let guilt start dictating your actions , you 're just asking for trouble . I don 't know , maybe you needed more time to recuperate after surgery . I 'm fine , sir . Then get your head on straight . James , Marzen ... [ Water pouring ] Any updates from the planet ? They 've lost the trail , so they 're doubling back . I 'd like to volunteer to help with this rescue op . Well , much appreciated , but Colonel Young and his team are more than capable of seeing this through . With all due respect , no , they 're not . They have the training , but they lack the necessary experience . Me and my people have been hunting most of our lives . We can track this animal for you . We can do it better , faster than anyone you 've got down there on the ground right now . When this is over , you 're going to want to know that you did everything in your power to save them . Right ? Well , it happened so fast . One minute I was helping to catalogue plant samples , and the next I was on the ground and everyone was screaming . Hey . I just heard . Come to check up on us , huh ? Yeah . Yeah , I came to check up on you ... Both . How are you ? Oh , in constant pain ! I think my ankle 's broken . Every time I move- - Well , hang in there . How about you ? According to the medical scan , a cracked rib . Ha ! I should be so lucky . How do you , uh , how do you treat a cracked rib ? You don 't . Speaking from personal experience . Snowboarding accident . You just take it easy . It 'll heal itself in about a month . In a month ? Okay , is there anything you need ? Anything I can do ? Yeah , could you take off my sock ? Are you serious , dude ? My foot 's swelling up ! I 'll get that for you . Thanks for coming by . Yeah , it was nothing . Rush had me up on the bridge running diagnostics ... I really appreciate it . Yeah , no , I , uh ... Just wanted to make sure you were all right . [ Shuffling ] Lieutenant ? Lieutenant ! Oh , thank God . [ Groans ] Where are we ? I don 't know . How did we get here ? The thing that attacked the camp , it took us here . We must 've lost our sidearms in the commotion . Your radio , too . Here , I 've got mine , but it 's damaged . We have to get out of here . [ Groans in pain ] I can 't put any weight on my leg . I think it might be broken . [ Winces ] It could just be a fracture . Hang tight . If this thing wanted to kill us , we 'd be dead already , so I figure that 's a good thing , right ? It wants us alive . It 's saving us . Saving us ? From what ? Not from anything . It 's saving us for later . I don 't like it . Yeah , well , you don 't have to like it , just pretend you do , at least until we get our people back . Here they come . It 's about time . We just wanted to check out the camp site . We appreciate your help . Don 't mention it . We 're all in this together , right ? The fact that there 's no significant blood at the camp site is a good sign . It suggests the creature wanted them alive . Why ? Probably likes its meat fresh , which means we 've got to move quickly . The sooner we locate them , the better because this rescue op has the potential to turn into a recovery mission real fast . Looks like it 's going to get dark soon . Here ! Partial print there , and there . Heading off in that direction . You know , w-we finally unseal a new section , make the biggest discovery aboard this ship since the bridge , and now we 're supposed to ignore it because Rush says so ? He wants to be cautious . Since when is Rush cautious ? Well , I guess having your consciousness trapped in a simulation will do that to you . Screw this . Where you going ? To check out the stasis pods , and don 't tell on me , all right ? Wait for me . Wait , wait , wait , where are you going ? [ T.J. ] : Relax , corporal . How does it look ? Not good . That thing is still down there . It 's guarding its lair , and you 're in no condition to make a run for it . Look , Lieutenant , please , I-I know you 'd stand a better chance out there without me , but I- - Listen ! I 'm not leaving you behind , and when the time comes , I am going to need your help , so I need you to calm down . You need to get it together , okay ? Can you do that ? Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Oh , hey . I 'm , uh , just on my way to the mess . Can I get you anything ? No , I 'm good , thank you . Hey , how 's the , uh , search going ? Um , I-I don 't know . I haven 't heard anything since Varro and his team went down . Let 's hope that makes a difference . It 's , um , times like these that really make you appreciate what you have- - Who you have . Yeah , oh , for sure . It 's like , um ... Well , having Matt has made such a difference , knowing he 's there for me no matter what . I 'm really lucky to have that someone . So , does Lisa know ? Know what ? How you feel about her ? I know it 's probably none of my business , but I ... saw the way you two were together and- - we were ? No , no . No , Lisa ... Lisa and I , we 're just , it 's strictly plat- - p-professional . Platonic . Professionally platonic . We 're not- - Oh , I 'm sorry . I totally misread- - Oh , no , no , it 's a simple mistake . No , no , that-that happens , you know , sometimes , so ... You 're going to the mess hall ? Yes . That 's where I 'm going . 'Kay . Thank you . I 'm just saying , recent events have made me put things in perspective . Like , who made him de facto leader ? He did . He was lead scientist on Icarus . And I 'm the one who solved the mystery of the ninth chevron . Yeah , thanks for that . So , what are you saying ? You want to be lead scientist ? [ Quickly ] No ... I just , I think it 's time that we all had more of a say in the decisions that are being made . I 'm tired of him deciding what 's best for us . [ Panels activate ] Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Whoa ! Hold on ! Hey , hey ! Whoa . Thanks . Great . What did you do ? I didn 't do anything . What did you- - you accidentally pressed something ! Now , hit the " open " button . Oh , ' cause there 's a- - [ beeps button ] [ Gas hissing ] Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! I-I ... Oh , that can 't- - Hey ! Eli ! Hold on , hold on ! Crap ! I got it ! Eli , will you- - ! [ Pod chimes , gas freezes ] Uh , maybe ... can we- - [ Varro ] : You guys do much hunting back on Earth ? [ Young ] : Not unless you count fishing . [ Varro ] : Well , growing up , my brother and I , we learned from my father , how to hunt , kill , but the most important things he taught us was respect for the wild . [ Greer ] : There ain 't nothing noble about this thing . It 's a monster . Yeah , but unlike us , animals don 't know hate . All they know is fear and hunger . Hey , I got something here ! The tracks , uh ... They just stop . [ Branches creaking ] Okay . There 's been a lot of movement here . [ Beast snarling , tracker screams ] Get down , get down ! [ Soldiers screaming ] [ Beast snarling ] Ah ! [ Blows thud , Greer shouts ] [ Firing wildly ] [ Beast snarling ] [ Gasps , startled ] Stop ! Get off me ! We 've got it on the run ! Now 's our chance ! The hell we do ! It 'll draw you out , separate you from the group , then pick you off ! What the hell do you think happened back there ? It led us to that spot , it waited for us . It 's smart ! All this time we 've been hunting it , it 's been hunting us . Are you ready ? [ Wincing in pain ] Do it ! [ Shoulder clunks ] [ Gasping in pain ] Got it ? Yeah . [ Breathing hard ] What ? Why didn 't you pull that trigger ? There 's no predicting how someone 's gonna react in a pressure situation . Panic sets in . People freeze . It happens ... But not to you . Something got inside your head . What ? I think I died . After the kidney surgery , during the recovery , there was a point when I woke up ... to nothing . I couldn 't hear , couldn 't see , couldn 't move . I was trapped in this darkness , you know , like nothing I 've ever known . [ Whispers ] : You were scared . That 's a normal reaction . I 've done some crazy things in my day , risked my life without even giving it a second thought . No fear . But now ... All I know is that darkness ... And the fact that I don 't ever want to go back . T.J. had you under some pretty heavy sedatives for that operation . They shut you down . Your brain was probably the first thing to wake up , and it just took the rest of your body a little while to catch up . You think that 's what it was ? I can 't claim to know for sure what death is , but I know in my heart it isn 't that . [ Wincing in pain ] [ Gasping ] This should do till you get back to the ship . I 'm not going back . I 'm not giving up on my people . No one 's giving up . You 've just got to think this through . [ Breathing hard ] It won 't take much for those stitches to open up . If you start bleeding out , then what ? I 'm sorry , but in your condition , you 're a liability to us . At best , you slow us down . At worst , you die . I 'll get her back . You have my word . We need to get moving . We can come back , bury the bodies later . [ Groaning in pain ] You listen to me , you bring her back safe . All right ... Let 's , uh , let 's go . Hello , Eli . Come in ? [ Clears throat awkwardly ] Yeah ? Good morning . Is Mr. Brody with you ? [ Laughs ruefully ] [ Tersely ] Yup . [ Activates control panel ] You two are supposed to be in the control interface room running diagnostics . Where are you ? We 're just grabbing something to eat . Yeah , well , hurry up . I know it 's not the most glamorous work , but it needs to be done . We 'll finish up , be on our way . Here ? This is good . Good for what ? Why are we stopping ? We 've already established this creature is smart . It sees us as a threat , so it 's stalking us , and sooner or later , it 's going to try to ambush us again , but this time , we 'll be ready for it . Here we go . How we doing for time ? We 've got six hours till Destiny jumps . They wouldn 't abandon us . No , not unless they think we 're dead . Which is why I really need to get this radio working . Were you ... Watching me sleep ? No , no . N-no , I was just checking to see if you were ... If you were awake , which you seemed not to be , but then now ... Then you are now . I brought you something to eat . Oh , that was sweet of you . Dr. Park ... How are you feeling ? I 'm- - [ wincing ] : Fine . Thanks . How are getting on with those calculations ? Oh , yeah , I finished them . I can 't believe this . You 're making her work ? She 's injured . Yes , her ribs , not her brain . Dale , I asked him to give me something to do . I 'm going stir crazy just sitting here . Good , good . See you back on the bridge . Yeah , I 'm just going to finish up with my visit and- - Hey , take your time . [ Walkie crackles ] Anything ? [ Man ] : Nothing . [ Woman ] : Not yet . I got a bad feeling that this is a mistake . I mean , while we 're sitting here , that thing is putting as much distance between us as possible . No , the creature knows we 're hunting it , so it needs to protect its lair . To do that , it has to make sure we never reach it . Yeah ... Makes sense . You know , but if you 're wrong about this , don 't count on making it back to the ship . You don 't think I want to save them ? Yeah . [ Laughs knowingly ] I 'm sure you do . You look like you got more to say . Well , whatever you have in mind for you and T.J. , you can forget about it , you know ? 'Cause that 's not happening . Why don 't we let her decide that ? [ Walkie crackles ] : Varro ... Go ahead , Tasia . It 's on the move and headed your way . Here we go . [ Beast roars distantly ] Come on ... [ Beast snarling closer ] Come on . I 'm right here . I 'm right here ! [ Beast roars ] [ Beast snarling , branches crackle underfoot ] [ Dirt and debris clattering ] [ Breathing hard ] Did you get it ? Oh yeah . All right . We should get moving . In a few hours it 's going to start to get dark- - [ screaming , beast roars ] [ Soldier yelps ] [ Many beasts roaring ] There are more of them out there . Following their trail 's gotten way too easy . It 's almost as if they 're daring us to come after them . They 're luring us in to finish us off . The thing that attacked us back at the camp is bigger than the ones we 're tracking now . These tracks are smaller . These are the babies . We 're getting close to their lair . The fact that we 're dealing with more than one of these things reduces our chances of finding our people alive . Are you saying you 're having second thoughts ? Because , you know , I can do this on my own . Oh , no , you can 't . Hell , I don 't even think we can do this together , but I 'm going to see this through . Besides , this close to the nest , we 're past the point of no return . That thing 's too big , too strong . I can 't stand the thought of being eaten alive . When the time comes , if I don 't have the guts to do it myself ... What are you saying , corporal ? I 'm saying I don 't want to die like that ! [ Angrily ] : I 'd rather you finished me off first ! Hey . Hey , you listen to me ... Now , you have two choices . You can suck it up and walk back on the Destiny with your head held high , or you can force me to save your sorry ass , and live with the shame . Is that understood ? Yes , ma 'am . [ Clicks switch ] [ Walkie beeps crackles with static ] This is - this is Lieutenant Johansen . Over . Is there anyone out there ? You remind me of someone I used to run ops with . First one into a firefight , last one to leave enemy territory . He was fearless . He ended up volunteering for what you 'd call a suicide mission . He wasn 't afraid . Turns out he should 've been . He was wrong . In those situations when the odds are stacked against you , and you 're looking death in the face , it 's fear that keeps you , and the people around you , alive . This is Lieutenant Johansen ... [ Surprised ] : This is Greer . Over . [ T.J. , gleefully ] : Sergeant ? Lieutenant , what 's your situation ? Uh , Corporal Reynolds and I are in a cave on the side of a hill overlooking a ravine . Somewhere north of camp . The creature that attacked us , it brought us here , and it appears to be guarding its territory , so approach with extreme caution . The corporal is injured and in no condition to make a run for it . Hang tight , Lieutenant . We 're coming for you . [ Chuckles with relief ] Copy . Sorry . Lost track of time . Yeah , well , I 'm not surprised . You two obviously enjoy each other 's company . I 'm not sure if you meant anything by that , but you should know there 's nothing going on between me and Park . Of course not . What do you mean , " of course not " ? Y-you say it like it could never happen . Well , it couldn 't . Okay , I get it . Because she 's so ... attractive , and I 'm- - and I 'm not ? No , no , no , no , let 's ... let 's just say that you don 't seem like ... The romantic type . Oh , really ? Okay , well , then , uh , what type am I ? The good friend type , obviously . The trusted confidant . The guy who 's always there with the , uh , the shoulder to cry on . And that 's just life , I 'm afraid . We all have our predestined roles , but , you know , on the bright side , a life free of romantic entanglements , well ... It certainly benefits the pursuit of science . Seriously , Eli , I don 't have time for this . They need me in the infirmary . Colonel Young and Lieutenant James just got back . They 're injured- - What did you do ? I didn 't do anything . He did this to himself . He was just in there pushing buttons- - Is he okay ? Yes , according to the monitoring system , he 's fine . Just ... frozen . Did you tell Rush ? Oh , no , no , no , no , and we 're not going to , not yet , anyway . Just for once I 'd like to solve a problem without his help . Eli , you have to get him out of there . You still have some of that residual alien knowledge , right ? Just ... do me a favor . Take a look . See if anything jumps out at you ? Um ... That 's got to be it . I 'll go first , scout out the area . If it 's clear , I 'll radio back . I don 't think so . If you got something say , say it . I don 't think you 're up for this . You calling me a coward ? No , you 're not a coward , but you 're second-guessing yourself , and that 's a problem . We don 't have time for you to sort through whatever issues you 're dealing with . So I 'm going . No , I 'm going . But I 'm going to need you to , uh , create a little diversion for me . [ T.J. ] : We 're going to be okay . They 're almost here . [ Beast roars ] [ Heavy footsteps approach slowly ] [ Beast growls ] [ Snarling ] You ready , corporal ? Yes , ma 'am . Aim for its eyes . [ Snarling ] [ Explosion outside , beast roars ] [ Beasts snarling all around ] [ Roaring ] Lieutenant ! [ Roaring ] Don 't shoot ! What ? I-I don 't think it wants to hurt us . I 've got the shot , ma 'am . No , the fire . It recognizes intelligence . Didn 't stop it from trying to kill us . That 's because you were a threat to it and its family . It recognizes a threat and goes after it . That 's what I was counting on out there to buy us some time , so I suggest that you start moving . [ Beast snarling ] Slowly . Let 's go . It 's intelligent . Smart enough to know that I can cause it a world of hurt , maybe even kill it , and smart enough to know that I 'm choosing not to . [ Snarling softly ] [ Footsteps pound ] [ Growls ] [ Sniffing ] Let 's go . Ah , well . [ Controls beep ] So ? I don 't know , I 'm not seeing anything . I- - [ pod powers up , door opens ] Doing ? What the hell ? [ Panel beeps ] That 's that , then . What 's what ? I 've just completed a thorough diagnostic of one of the stasis pods . Very informative . How many of those things you take down ? About none , but I managed to lose them and circle back . I feel like I could sleep for a week . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . [ Door cranks open ] Congratulations , I hear you 're a free man . Apparently someone put in a good word for me with Colonel Young . As much as I 'd like to take credit , I really haven 't had any time . I know . It was , um , Sergeant Greer . Greer ? Mm-hm . [ Chuckles ] I 'd love to thank him , but , um , I get the feeling he 'll claim he doesn 't know what I 'm talking about . [ Laughs ] Yeah , probably . Listen , I just wanted to come by and say I 'm sorry about your people ... And even though you may feel like you 're alone ... You 're not . [ Quietly ] : I know . [ Knock on door ] [ Door cranks open ] Come in . You had said you wanted to lend your expertise to tonight 's dinner . Becker 's ready . You , uh , you okay ? I 'm good . Good . [ Sighs ] That completes this round of diagnostics . Now we can move on to the fun part . Fun part ? Yeah , well , it 's time to go and check out the stasis chambers now . Whoa , uh , whoa , not so fast . Let 's finish going through the data on that section before we start ... Heading in there and pushing buttons . Yeah , of course , you 're right . Proceed with caution . [ Park and Greer chatting quietly ] [ They giggle fondly ] [ Chatting quietly ] [ ♪ ] [ ♪ ] = = sync , corrected by elderman = =

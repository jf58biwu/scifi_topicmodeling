 They are coming . Who 's coming ? Our world 's being taken over by an advanced species of humans we call Observers . Bite my hand and I will put you down . I am Dr. Walter Bishop . I had a plan to fight back . They weren 't all bad . One of them tried to help us . He was called September . Before we could strike , we were forced to amber ourselves . Twenty years later , some of our team were found . - What year is it ? - 2036 . Do you know me ? I 've been stuck in that amber for over 20 years . You barely look old enough- - Henrietta ? Hi , Dad . The battle to save mankind is about to begin . Olivia ? - Olivia ? - It 's okay . She 's just resting . My little girl ? - No children brought in . She was with us . Where are they keeping the kids ? Etta . Etta ! Dad ? You all right ? Yeah , I 'm all right . I was just checking up on you . What time is it ? It 's around 7 . I made some tea . And I found these in the fridge . They 're called egg sticks . Oh , my God , what is that ? Punishment food ? Welcome to 2036 . The word " Naugahyde " not found . Naugahyde was a very popular premium pleather . - American patents , 1960s ... - Peter . You let me oversleep . We should be on our way to find Olivia . Nobody wants to find Olivia more than I do , but you 're gonna need some pants . I 'm aware I 'm not wearing pants , Peter . I 'm not an idiot . The last time I spoke to her , she was in that location . - Columbus Circle , 2015 . - She was in New York ? She called me the day she disappeared . I could hardly hear her . The line went dead . You understand that conversation was 21 years ago . She could be anywhere , in this city or not . She had a piece of the puzzle . A crucial piece . This is just one part . - What I sent her to get will unlock the whole . - The whole what ? Plan to defeat the Observers . September and I worked on the plan he provided in a unique way . After we completed each component , the information was scrambled in my mind . A precaution against being read . He told me that when the time came to implement the plan I had to retrieve something from Grand Central Station . And that then , all would be clear . And that 's what I sent Olivia to get . She was on her way back when she vanished . She never returned . A few days later , I ambered us . - Good God ... what 's that ? - That 's an egg stick . What a miserable future . Aspen . Help me find my shoes . There 's no time to waste . We have to believe she 's still alive . I know you 're doubting that right now . How could you know that ? Because how could she be ? After all these years what are the odds of getting us all back ? If she 's still alive , Henrietta , we 're gonna find her . So this is what 's left of Columbus Circle . A travesty . A travesty . What did they do to the park ? They paved it to build machines that pump carbon monoxide into the atmosphere . - Why ? - There 's one on every continent . The air here , it 's too oxygen-rich for them . Few more years , the effects will be irreversible . It 'll reduce the average non-Observer life span to somewhere around 45 . It was somewhere around here she called me . She was running . That much I could ascertain . And then the connection was suddenly cut . Walter . Yes , Olivia could be trapped in there . We had already discussed the possibility of using amber as a last resort should we be at risk of being caught by the Observers . I had already given her an ambering device . I would have given one to you too if you hadn 't abandoned us . Walter . - He didn 't mean it . - Sure he did . Oh , no . What are all those holes ? Everyone 's gone . Fourth Gen Amber Removal . They were taken recently . So the Observers have Olivia ? No . Amber Gypsies . What on Earth are Amber Gypsies ? Oh , my . The black market thrives here . Hello there . I fell in love in Japan once . I almost married her . Come on , Walter . Go down three halls . It 's the first area on your right . You 're not coming ? Fringe shakes these guys down all the time . Someone will recognize me . The path to happiness is just around the corner . - Join us for a better world . - Walnuts ? Deal closer . That 's almost $ 3000 . If they tell you any different , they 're trying to rip you off . Excuse me , we 're looking for someone who was cut out of amber not far from here . We 're not Loyalists . Just concerned family members . Freshest cuts are on the left . I still can 't believe my eyes . What you 've grown into . Of course , you must understand that for me it 's only two months ago I took you to the pier . You loved the horses . Carousel . You remember ? No . I Wish I did . That 's just what they call them , right ? Carousels ? They used to anyway . To me , you will forever be a little girl . The woman I 'm looking for , she 's a blond . So is my sister . Those are the cuts . This one would be hard to forget . Well , information 's expensive . She would 've had an electronic device in her hand . Huh . - Late 20s , black leather jacket ? - Yeah . She was sold . She was sold ? Sold to who ? Your stage is waiting for you , Maverick . - You selling tickets ? - No , but you 're buying one . - lam ? - Yes , indeed . You being an understanding soul . And one that don 't like violence . Let 's get out of here . We don 't want any trouble . You 're right , doc , not that kind . This apartment is sanctioned . I have invoked Native Rights , Statute 23D . - Go away . - Markham ? Markham is dead . He died a hero 's death . People were sad . He gave his life saving a bus full of small children and- - You 're alive . Where is she ? - All of you . - Where is she ? - Why haven 't you aged ? How did you not age ? We know you bought her . I love her . From the first time she came into my bookstore . I never meant her any harm . How 'd you get her here ? You had to use a dolly or something . It 's not supposed to happen this way . She 's supposed to wake up and see me as her savior . When I figure out exactly how to wake her up . A gurney . Peter . Here . This place is a treasure trove of literature . She 's supposed to overlook my height and realize that I 'm really good for her and that I love her . I have gone into substantial debt over this . You have something to report ? - I got some information to sell . - Is it Level 4 ? Yeah , it 's good . Some people I saw on Reward Wire . I want three times the vouchers for my loyalty . Proceed . What 's taking Walter so long ? I wanna get her out of here . I 'll go check . Whoa ! Isaac Asimov . May I ? Who cares ? I tried my hand at science-fiction writing once . Once . Resistance is futile . I feel like I 've heard that before . Walter , run . Please don 't kill me . Please don 't kill me . Please don 't kill me . - Etta . You okay ? - I 'm okay . I 'm okay . - Where 's Walter ? - He should be here . GO ' Go ! What are we gonna do about Walter ? Don 't move . Okay , you ready ? Three , two , one . Olivia . Olivia , breathe . Breathe . You 're okay . You 're okay . Breathe , Olivia , breathe . Breathe . There you go . Peter . Where am I ? You 're in the year 2036 . - I ambered myself . - I know you did . We all did . I found her . More to the point , she found us . Olivia , I want you to meet Etta . Kiddo , come meet your mom . Hi , Mama . You 're beautiful . So are you . The last time I saw you , you were 3 years old . All this time , I thought I was 4 . No . You were 3 years one month and five days . There was not one moment that I didn 't think about you . Where 's Walter ? - He was captured this morning . - By the Observers . Walter worked out a plan to defeat the Observers with September . - You were gonna give him something- - - From Grand Central Station . Here . - What is it ? - I don 't know . I was on my way to Walter when I triggered the ambering device . So where did they take Walter ? We 're working on that . We have been looking for you and your friends . I am very interested in you . I don 't know why you 're alive . Oh . You 're trying to think of music . You miss music . There 's not a lot of it here . We tolerate it but it 's merely tones , rhythms and harmonic vibrations . I don 't understand . Mostly , it amazes me . Music helps you shift perspective to see things differently , if you need to . See things ? Like hope ? Yes . Very much like that . But there is no hope for you . Nothing grows from scorched earth . You seem much more interesting as a human being than as a vegetable . But quite frankly , all things being equal I don 't mind which one you end up . The choice is yours . Wait here . Anil . Etta . What happened ? Elias was shot this afternoon coming out the square . I need your help . We didn 't save the world . Not even by half . She 's still trying , though . How long do you think it 's been since they made one of these ? I could use one now . I never thought I 'd see you again , Olivia . I know what you thought of me when I wouldn 't leave Boston to come to New York with you . When I left you alone . No , Peter , we lost our child . And in the grief we just were unable or incapable of being what we needed to be for each other . And that was all it was . You were stronger than me . You could do something that I couldn 't do . You saw that the world needed us , and you went to help them . And I just ... I didn 't have the will to give up searching for this ... This perfect little soul that we made . Out here for all these years fighting for these people , defending them . And at the moment that she needed her father to protect her , I couldn 't do it . And I wanted more than anything for that not to be true . And in the state of mind that I was in that meant at all costs . Including us . Come with me . This is Anil . It 's an honor to meet you . What we have here is a Transilience Thought Unifier , Model-11 . So , what 's it do ? Turn it on . Can we access its information ? No , that 's not how it works . - It accesses your information . - What do you mean ? It retrieves specifically marked thoughts in your mind and unifies them . For what purpose ? - To keep them hidden from prying eyes ... - ... until you want to access them . - Exactly . - But it doesn 't seem to work any longer . - That 's what Walter meant . - All will become clear when he gets this . - It has to be . The plan , it was fragmented and hidden on Walter 's hard drive by September . You guys ? We found Walter . This is from across the street from where Dr. Bishop was taken . We 'll track him with traffic cameras . This is two blocks from here . Can you do that across the city ? - I haven 't lost many people doing this but I have lost some , so no promises . This thing , it 's crucial to Walter 's plan . But it is conceivable ... - ... he could give them that information . - If he hasn 't already . And who 's to say what else . Does he know you 're a Fringe agent ? Who freed you and your team from the amber ? Why did they free you ? What do they expect to get from you ? You 're partitioned . Someone gave you information out of sequence . They did this on purpose to protect something . How did you learn to fragment your thoughts like that ? Was it an Observer , as you call us , who partitioned you ? No one else would know how to do that . The ideas are disparate , but part of a whole . Put them together for me please . Put them together for me . What plan ? To defeat us ? What are the elements of this plan ? Let me organize them for you please . You are fighting much more than I would have thought possible . Walter Bishop . If I only had a Unifier , I could unify these thoughts . I could go through the trouble to get one but it would take weeks to break the biology key specific to your encryption . But that doesn 't mean I will not get the information out . It will make it harder to get to it but it will come out . Who 's the little girl ? Who 's the little blond girl ? She 's helping you , the little blond girl . How can this small child be helping you ? What is her name ? She 's amazing , Peter . There 's so many things I wanna tell her ... - ... and so many things that I wanna ask her . - You will . It 's like living this beautiful dream inside of a horrible nightmare . Got him . That 's the Napean building . They took it over a couple of years ago . - It had to be that one . - Anyone ever gotten in ? No , but ... What ? - We 've been working on this tech . - Anil . It 's not perfected yet , but it could work . So , what is it ? It 's tech which will make our bodies appear dead . Impossible for the baldies to detect any life force . We 've been saving it because after we use it once , they know we 'll have it . Sort of like reusing the Trojan horse . We could kill hundreds of them with this tactic . We could get in anywhere , including their headquarters . - Why save one man with this ? - The future . I believe that whatever his plan is to defeat the Observers , it will work . Please . Killing our enemies is one thing . Saving the world is another . Okay . Let 's do this . Come with me . Windmark wanted the bodies of these resistance fighters brought in . I was wondering where you 've been . It 's always brighter when you 're here . - You hear what happened ? - What ? - I was raised to Level 6 . Did I tell you ? - That 's great . Hey , if I share something you promise you won 't tell ? Yeah . They found Agent Foster in amber . Your superior was a double agent . He was working with the resistance . He was with someone named William Bell . What did they do With him ? That 's above my paygrade . Ask Windmark yourself . He 'll certainly wanna talk to you about it . These physics in your mind they are also above your comprehension . What are the stones utilized for ? I don 't You must try . What are the stones ? What is your plan to defeat us ? Let down the walls . I am your ally . Nice watch . I want his boots too . Hey . Ugh ! Hunh ! - What happened to him ? - Occupational hazard . That 's my girl . - What , they need this to breathe ? - Apparently . This one 's only temporary . They 're building a more permanent one in Central Park . They don 't like clean air . All right , it 's always the red wire . Unless it 's the white wire . That did it . Let 's go . Clearly , we are done here . I must say , your brain will make an excellent specimen . Air control malfunction . Air control malfunction . Air control malfunction . - Walter . Walter ? - Air control malfunction . - Walter . - Is he okay ? - I don 't know . - Air control malfunction . Air control malfunction . Air control malfunction . - Air control malfunction . - Over here . Peter ! Okay , fire ! My God , Walter . Afro . Do you have any music ? Hello , little girl . Olivia . - I am so happy you 're alive . - Walter , do you recognize this ? It 's what September wanted you to find . It 's called a Thought Unifier . Or at least it was . This one 's long since dead . He must have designed it specifically for you . - What 's it used for ? - Well , it 's meant to collect and make sense of the scrambled plan that September put in your mind . What plan ? You told us you knew all the parts of the plan , all the elements . You just weren 't sure what they were supposed to be used for . Walter , do you remember this ? Whose hand is that ? It 's William Bell 's hand . Are you out of your mind ? Why would we have William Bell 's hand ? You said we needed his handprint so we could get access to one of his storage facilities . I don 't remember it . I don 't remember any of it . I have failed myself . I have failed the world . What is wrong with me ? - What has happened to- - ? - Walter . I can 't do it . I can 't even recognize myself . It 's like there 's nothing left to unify . All the parts are gone . Or they took them . It 's more likely they were destroyed when he was fighting it . Will they ever heal ? No . The plan is gone . Looking from a window above It 's like a story of love Can you hear me ? Came back only yesterday Moving farther away Want you near me All I needed was the love you gave All I needed for another day And all I ever knew Only you Sometimes when I think of her name When it 's only a game And I need you Listen to the words that you say It 's getting harder to stay When I see you

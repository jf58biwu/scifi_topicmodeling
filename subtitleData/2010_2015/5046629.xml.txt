 2x13 - Night Falls Are we there , yet ? All this futuristic technology , and you 've never thought about bathroom ? City hall ! It must have a bathroom ! Pull over ... now ! Bathroom ? Caesar . Is it you ? - Esteban ? - It 's mayor Esteban now . Mayor ? When you ran for class president , Maria Rodriguez got all the votes . She was smarter and much better-looking . And I see you 're still building your crazy contraptions . What brings you back to town ? To visit Abuela . It 's a surprise . You don 't want to go there . It is not the same as you remember . Okay , bro , let 's go ! Is that little raghead ? I haven 't thought of that for years . - What ? - Nothing , son . We 'd better get going . At least stay in town tonight . You can head up to Abuela 's in the morning . It 's been over five years , Esteban . We 're not waiting another minute . If she is not really your grandmother , why are you calling her " Abuela " ? There may not be a biological connection , but she practically raised the entire town . When you were a boy , you spent every summer here . I wish I could remember her . Or any of this . I 'm sure she 'll be excited to see you . Just prepare yourself for a lot of sloppy grandma kisses . Abuela . It 's me ... Caesar . Caesar ? And is that my raghead ? Why is everyone calling me that ? What are you doing here ? We 've come to visit . May we come in ? - No ! - Maybe we should 've called first . ♪ So make way to start the Revolution ♪ ♪ make way we 're gonna have fun tonight ♪ ♪ make way to start the Revolution ♪ ♪ so make way . ♪ ♪ So make way to start the Revolution ♪ ♪ make way to start the Revolution ♪ ♪ so make way . ♪ 10 more minutes , six . Who wants breakfast ? Yo ! Abuela always was the best cook . I have missed my children . Rex , I have been following your work with providence . And I always knew you would be a big important scientist . So why did you slam your door last night ? Oh , that . You just caught me off guard . We weren 't expecting visitors . I thought you always - - Enough with the questions , little brother . Let me look at you . I can 't believe how you have grown . Come ... see the rest of the family . Does everyone in town live here ? I remember evenings here - - laughing , telling stories . And the food ! Rex , if you thought breakfast was good , wait and see what Abuela makes for dinner . It is an old building . There are always repairs . Uh ... what 's up ? It 's me - - Federico . Have you forgotten the secret shake ? You and Federico were best friends when you were little . Ragheads ! Why do you keep calling me that ? You used to put underpants on your heads and act out wrestling movies . Glad I don 't remember that . Lucky you . Abuela , I must speak to you . Someone has forgotten his manners . You can 't just keep avoiding me . My phone has been ringing off the hook . The village is concerned about the recent ... activity . Well , they shouldn 't be . What goes on here is our own business . Not when it leaves these walls . The situation is getting worse . We have made the neccessary corrections . It won 't happen again . You 've got one last chance to get out of town . Or I will evict you myself . An old scrubble . You don 't need to worry . What aren 't you telling us , Abuela ? Time to start making dinner . Dinner ? We just had breakfast . Trust me . To family ! Family ! Is it like this every night ? Pretty much . Hey . You 're pretty good . Ever think about going pro ? Not anymore . Okay , maybe not my best move . - But it wasn 't that bad . - Come , children ! You 'll sleep here . See you in the morning . Did she just lock us in ? - She locked us in ! - We need to respect our elders . I 'm sure she hat her reasons . Ooh ! Bed 's pretty comfy . Good night . But - - but ... It 's only 6 : 30 ! Sure . That 's not weird , either . Good . I 'm glad you could return my call . I understand you can help me with my Evo problem . Federico ? That 's his room behind here ! Can you break it down ? What about respecting my elders ? Technically , I am your elder . Break it down ! I 'll do one better . Hunh ! This place is just full of surprises . Okay , fur face , if you ate my friend ... - Rex , wait ! - There has been a breach ! Where is Rex ? I suspect halfway down the hill by now . Abuela ... I know . That is for Federico ! Rex ! No ! That is Federico ! Are those your hands ? Genial . I got out again , didn 't I ? So , you 're like a Were-evo ? Light-wolf mutant . Interesting . Come - - we 've got to get back to the house . I told you this would happen . You can 't control them anymore . Uh , it wasn 't her - - It was me . I let him out . I didn 't know . - All these Evos ! - They 're just boys . Look at the destruction your " boys " caused . The people are tired of living in fear . You 'll be leaving today . I am sorry Abuela . I had no idea . And now you have to leave because of me . I 'm not going anywhere ! We turn at sundown and then back at sunrise . It only happens to some of us . I took samples from all of the affected family members . Everyone shares the same genetic code - - something similar to Hypertrichosis . - Hyper ... what ? - Werewolf syndrome . The nanites triggered the dormant gene . Can you cure it ? I can try . Strange . I don 't feel anything . Do you ? Thanks anyway . I 'm seeing no active nanite traces whatsoever . Well , maybe it 's because he 's not in Evo form . I just want a normal life again . I don 't want to have to leave my home . Maybe there 's a way you can have both . Sorry about the wall . Why didn 't you tell us ? Because I didn 't want providence to know . But providence can help . By taking those afflicted away ? No . Every night , when the bell tolls , those that have the change are locked away safely . For years , it has been this way , and no one has been hurt . But you 're prisoners in your own home ! You may see it that way , child , but at least we are a family . You know , if I was busted today , it was kind of fun to get out . Don 't you ever feel cooped up in here ? There is one thing I miss . Goal ! Why did you stop playing if you loved it so much ? One day during practice , I stayed late so some scouts could see me play . Sun went down , and , well ... they made me quit the league after that . Still haven 't replaced the goal box . - Is that providence ? - I don 't know who it is . We should probably get back . It 's almost evening bell . Rex ! That guy just shot my ball ! Oh , this is just perfect . Hunter Cain . He has a thing for hunting down Evos . I already put him away once . So what 's he doing here ? Guessing your mayor called him . No , I mean , did he break out or something ? Don 't know . Don 't care . Why am I not surprised ? This one of them ? Bringing this guy here was a bad move . For them . And I get to settle an old score while I 'm at it . Lucky me . No - - lucky me ! - Rex , you gotta go . - You don 't have to worry . This guy is nothing to sweat . No ! Well , what do we have here ? Esteban , my friend , I may not even charge you for this one . The mayer was not kidding . He sent an Evo hunter who likes to shoot first and skip the questions . We 'll need every man , woman , and werewolf . You were warned Abuela . You can leave peacefully , or we will bring you out . I didn 't come here for conversation . But you said it would just be a show of force . We run them out of town - - no one gets hurt . I don 't negotiate with Evos or their families . If you don 't like what you 're about to see , you can head on down the hill . Why don 't you join them , Hunter ? I never back down from a fight . Neither do I. You bring you magic evil bullets or is this going to be a real fight ? Lucky for you , these are the old-fashioned kind . But they hurt just as bad . Yeah , that is kind fo annoying . Just hours ago , there wasn 't any nanite activity . But now it 's like night and day . That was my little pun . It seems the samples are reacting differently in the absence of sunlight . If I can only work out the photo-reactive elements ... I don 't even think a cure will stop Hunter Cain . He 'll never listen to reason . I still got to try . I think I can effect a change in the nanite programming during the nocturnal cycle . If I 'm gonna cure this , I have to do it before sunrise . Not if Hunter gets to them first . I can keep doing this till you run out of ammo . Fire on target ! Note to self - - don 't give him any ideas . You have to lock them out . I made a promise to keep them safe from harm ! Where they can 't defend themselves ? That 's exactly what won 't happen ! Grandma , step aside . I stand with my family . Have it your way . I 'll take all of you down . You obviously haven 't met my family . Can 't believe we 're not related . So what was your big jail brake ? Nail file in a cake ? Exploding smoke bomb ? Cold , hard cash . Not everyone at providence is an Evo-lover . Yes ! We can reprogram the nanites to disregard the photo-reactive coding of their DNA with a frequency-tuned pulse ! That should allow you to cure them ! Sounds great , but I 've sort of got my hands full . You mess with my brother ... you mess with me . Who are you ? You an Evo ? No . I 'm a scientist . Your turn . Wait ! I thought you said you had to zap their nanites . In a manner of speaking . First , I zap you . Then , you have your nanites do the rest . Too strong . I 'll make an adjustment . Adjustment ? How about you wait for me to say " okay " next time ? You 're still here ? When I said I was out of the disintegrator ammo , I lied . One left , and it has your name on it . Federico , I 'm not sure if you can understand me , but it might be time for the return of ragheads . I think I have got the setting figured out . You think ? That 's more like it . Okay . Let 's give it a try . I 'm not trying to hurt you . Federico , my heart . Let him try . Maybe we have to wait for sunrise . We ... we made it worse . Now he 's stuck that way ! It isn 't him ... it 's me . I can control it now ! Doesn 't change a thing to me . He 's still an Evo . I 'm gonna finish the job I came here to do . I 'll wipe out the whole compound if I have to . There is no place for your kind of hatred here . Hunter : You think I 'm afraid of you ? I think you should be . Hunter knows I hold a grudge . He 'll come back . And we 'll be waiting . So , this mean you 're gonna try out for the pros ? I think it 's time we all go out and live our lives . Family ! Family ! Ragheads ! Ragheads !

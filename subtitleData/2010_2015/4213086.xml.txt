 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... So ... our own Warehouse Doctor , huh ? You like her . Ask the woman out . Do you wanna come with me for a little walk ? I 'd like that . - Who was Hugo Miller ? - A brilliant man . He 's ... Retired . Artie , half of his brain is burnt out . Time to set things right . - Thank you , Agent Nielsen . - I 'm so glad you 're back . Hello there . Sally Stukowski , FBI . You 've done well . [ Siren wailing ] Another one ? What is this ? She 's in P.E.A. Down two minutes . BP 's 90 over 50 . Pulse ox has dropped to 82 . - Amp of EPI . - Page Hillard upstairs . [ Chink ] Damn it ! Just like the others . - She 's in V-fib . - Charge the paddle to 50 . Okay , and ... Clear . What the hell ? [ Flatline tone ] I 've never seen anything like it . It 's why I called the CDC . You did the right thing to call us . I 'm gonna bring in a consultant . I think he 'll be very helpful , I 'm sure . - Thanks . - Yeah . Artie , where are you going in the middle of the night ? Ah ... Ha ha . Nowhere . No place . Why ? Is that the coat I got you ? This coat ? Uh ... So what ? Yeah . - Is that a clean shirt ? - Uh ... No , it 's not . Um ... Did you trim your eyebrows ? Hmm ? No . What 's that smell ? [ Sniffing ] What ? I don 't ... Smell anything . Exactly . You primped . [ Gasps ] You 're going to see Dr. Vanessa ! Who 's ... Dr. Vanessa ? - No one . - Oh , wow . I have never had a lie hurt before . She 's the Warehouse Physician . And ... Artie 's ... Girly girlfriend . Uh , yeah . Dr. Calder feels that there is an artifact that may be causing trouble in a hos ... [ Object clatters ] ... pital in Utah . And she has asked me , a colleague , to consult , and that is it ! And now , if you will excuse me ! Did I not leave enough food in your bowl ? - I 'm coming with you . - Why ? No . Why ? A hospital , Artie ? There will be blood . When you faint , someone 's gonna have to break your fall . Ohh ... Fine . Fine . All right . - Are you wearing spanx ? - Stop looking at me . What are you do--just- - oh ! Hi . We came as quickly as we could . Yeah . That 's record time . Oh , blue scrubs . They quite ... become you . I mean , it brings out the blue in your eyes and- - - Oh , thank you . - Cough , cough , said the uncomfortable young person . So ... Uh , what brings us to the great Salt Lake ... Oh , a series of very unusual deaths . They called us , so called you- - - I 'm sorry . They know about the Warehouse ? [ Cell phone chimes ] No , no , Vanessa was also on staff at the CDC . - Sorry . - Oh , oh , I get it . So the CDC is your Bruce Wayne daytime face , but you spend your dark knights with the Warehouse . - I gotcha . - She takes great pride in making references neither of us will ever understand , so ... Riddle me this , Batgirl . - Is that a heart ? - It was . I don 't get it . She smoked five packs a day ? Why is it all ... cracked and dry ? I sent a tissue sample to my lab . One of the technicians who spends his weekends as an amateur botanist made a really strange discovery . The heart muscle has actually metamorphosed into diatomaceous earth . What ? Uh , kidneys , spleen , lungs ... All this woman 's organs have turned to clay . Clay ? And ... you say there are others ? We may be facing an artifact outbreak .

Naked ! You 're naked too . [ Whimpers ] And why are you blonde ? I 'm not blond ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God , I 'm blond ! What did you do ? No ! Hey , don 't blame me ! I mean , I 'm good , but I 've never changed a woman 's hair color . Pete , we--we--we did not ... We did not do it , did we ? I don 't remember . - Did we get drunk ? - No ! No . No . I-I know hangovers , and I do not feel hung over . There ... must be some simple explanation why you and I would be in bed . Together . Naked . With Artie 's toothbrush . All the victims are female ? So far , yeah . I-I ordered a DNA analysis , but that 's gonna take a few days . Days we don 't have . But what we do have is ... Or , is that her original DNA sequencer ? - Yeah , it is . - Whose ? Well , Watson and Crick , they won a Nobel Prize for their proposal of the double helix nature of DNA . But all of their work was based entirely on the research of- - Rosalind Franklin , my personal hero . - Brava , doctor . - Thank you . Oh , it 's like watching Golden Gossip Girls . I 'll go do something . Thank you . Artie ... I really enjoyed our walk . The one we took- - - Me too . It was probably the best walk I ever ... walked . In fact , it was such a successful promenade that I was thinking perhaps ... We should take it to the next level ? A jog ? Well , you know , I-I could buy shorts . - Artie , I was kidding . - [ Laughs ] I think dinner would be nice . Right . When we get to the bottom of this . Of course . Of course . This will prove that we didn 't do anything . - You got it ? - I know how the durational spectrometer works . No , it 's--it 's the- - okay . All right . Right ? And this--okay . There ya go . Fast-forward , will you ? Okay . Okay , so far so ... You know , we 're just ... Great . Oh ... Look , we 're--we 're spooning . No . We 're not .

But this only shows the last five hours . I mean , stuff could have happened before ... that . Okay , but who did I call , and what does Artie 's toothbrush mean ? [ Farnsworth buzzing ] Artie . What 's going on there ? - Nothing ! Nobody had sex . - What ? Nothing . Just me joking ' around ! Jokin ' around ! - Why are you calling ? - I 'm returning your call . We didn 't call you , Artie . That wasn 't Pete singing the Pina Colada song on my voicemail at 3 : 00 in the morning ? Oh ! [ Laughs ] That ! Right . Yeah . - Yeah , well ... - Well ... Do you like ... taking walks in the rain ? [ Sighs ] It- - Myka , did you do something to your hair ? No . It always looks like this . Artie , um , does your toothbrush mean anything to you ? In the sense that it fights plaque and gingivitis , it means a great deal to me . [ Laughs ] You 're--hello ? There is only one explanation for all of us . Aha ! Several disturbances in the stacks . See ? It was an artifact that affected us . All right , well , let 's check ' em out and see if one of them whammyed us into ... Whammying each other . We did not whammy each other , okay ? And I will prove it , or I will die trying . Where are my shoes ? Hey , where 's Steve ? Yeah , I don 't know . Uh ... I 'll call him . He always answers his cell . [ Cell phone trilling ] [ Trilling ] That 's not good . Nope . No , it 's not . That 's a lotta Scrabble points . It 's the genome sequence of the last victim . Hmm . This doesn 't make sense . That--that can 't be right . I mean , that ... That 's not- - that 's not even ... - What ? Human . Those are not human DNA sequences . You know , people , plants , animals- - we 're all carbon-based . Carbon bonded with other elements makes up what we are , but those gene sequences are silicon-based or ... If this is a virus and that 's accurate , it 's actually changing their DNA . Do you see it ? See what ? See ? It 's a pattern . And it just repeats ... There . There , you see it now . Claudia : No . Okay . Whoa . How 'd you see that ? Just an old habit from my code-breaking days at the NSA . Code . That 's computer code . Of course ! It 's a computer virus ! But computer viruses only affect computers . They don 't affect people . Unless it 's super-sized by an artifact .

Oh , and you still have a way with the words . And you had a way with me , Vee . " Cough cough , " says Artie and Claudia . - No , no , it 's ... - I 'm sorry . I 'm just surprised as all get out to see Vee . We started at the Warehouse about the same time . Remember how we used to hang out in the dark vault , play records ? You and me and ... [ High-pitched ] Mary Jane ? What we had an agent named Mary Jane ? I don 't- - Good God , where did you come from ? What ? Dr. Calder , we have another victim . Tesla 315 .

It 's a waste of time working out for these people . Here , I 'll take my shirt off . No ! No , thanks . No , hey , anytime , man .

[ Coil humming ] [ Tesla zaps ] Well , not bad if you were trying to miss . [ Blows raspberry ] Firing a ray gun isn 't as easy as it looks in the movies . No , hey , no ! It is very hard to fire ray guns in the movies . How many times you see a storm trooper hit what he 's firing at ? Not once . Hoo ! Hoo-ah ! That 's not bad . Hoo hoo ! Not bad ?

[ Laughing ] [ Laughs ] [ Stifling laugh ] [ Both laughing ] [ Hiccup ] [ Both laughing ] Pete , look . We did get drunk ... Sort of . No , no , ' cause if I 'd have gotten drunk , I 'd have slept with somebody . [ Both gasp ] The number of victims are increasing . Did you find anything , Hugo ? Yes . The computer virus is literally rewriting this young woman 's DNA . I could spend a lifetime studying its effects . This reminds me of the case involving D.B. Cooper 's parachute . Oh , that was a weird one , even by Warehouse standards . Weird and wonderful as I recall . We have a lot of work to do , Agent Miller . Um , how do we reverse this process ? Well , we have to find the artifact . If we can discover how it made the computer virus communicable , I could write an antivirus and we can disseminate a cure . Ta-dah ! So , Vee and I will put our heads together , analyze its genetic structure , you and Claudia check out the young woman 's apartment . Maybe you 'll get lucky and , uh , find a clue as to the artifact 's whereabouts . Oh , that 's good . That 's fine . Um , I think that you 've got a firm grip on things here . So W.C. Fields' juggling balls make you drunk and pass out . How come every other artifact makes me have to call my sponsor ? Okay , according to the log , we disturbed that one too . Walt Disney 's paint brush . Wow . Oh , hey , look . Marilyn Monroe 's hairbrush . This explains that . [ Laughs ] Pete ? Yeah ? Look . Steve 's Tesla .

Okay , you 're always there for me , as annoying as that can be , and that can be pretty annoying . So how about we change things up and you let me be there for you for two minutes ? [ Sighs ] Artie ? Just because Hugo and Vanessa were an item back during the Civil War does not mean they 're getting back together . You and the doc have a good thing going . What thing ? We don 't have a thing . We have one walk . And I limped . Artie ... Claudia , I ... Given my line of work and my advanced years , I had pretty much made peace with the fact that I would not find ... [ Sighs ] Romantic companionship . Love . And then ... Vanessa . And so I started to hope . False hope , it would seem . Artie , it 's hope . How can it be false ? Uh , yeah . Well , can we just keep looking ? Is that all right with you ? Okay . No , not the computer . No , no , no . No , no , no , what do you doing ? From where do you think a computer virus is most likely to originate ? Right . That 's why you 're still alive after all these years . Wait a second . Tiger Direct . Yeah , it 's a computer chain store . We passed one on the way here . Why ? What--what are you doing ? No , don 't worry . My laptop 's safe . Bingo ! I just cross-referenced bank statements from the other five victims . They all have credit card charges from Tiger Direct . That is bingo . Time for Annie 's afternoon yoga . Tyler ! What the heck were you doing ? Nothing . I was on my break . You 're busted , my brother . Your attitude just wrote one too many checks your butt can 't cash .

And you know , only total jerkwads say " I.E. " Aah ! We need to speak to the employee that serviced these computers . Uh , these are all in-home calls . When it 's a home computer , we send out one of our Tiger-nicians . Oh , this explains a lot . Tyler Struhl . Tyler Struhl 's one of your--one of your- - Tiger-nician .

Attention , Tiger Direct shoppers . What the- - - Let 's play 20 questions . - That 's him . Question one . Does the store manager , Colin Shreve , make his repairmen use old fiber optic cables while he sells the new ones on the side to make cash ? Answer : Oh , yes . Little bastard . Question two . Is Colin banging Lydia in cell phones ? Answer : Yes again . Question 2a . Does Lydia 's boyfriend , Carl , over in digital cameras know about it ? He does now . What ? How is he still in the system ? I already changed the password . And the last question . Does anybody mind shopping in the dark ? I don 't care , losers !

It appears I have once again looked upon something I oughtn 't have . Yep . Lock these doors , officer . What ? Why ? Who the heck are you ? Lock ' em . Excuse me , everyone , may I have your attention , please ? My name is Dr. Vanessa Calder . I work for the Center for Disease Control .

Wait , wait , Artie , I 've been looking over the code he used when he hacked in , and to hack in , he used what 's called a battering ram . It just smashes through any firewall . It 's as nasty as I 've ever seen . This guy 's really good . Yeah , all right , just ... Anybody here know where would Tyler Struhl go other than home ? He likes this coffee shop at Fifth and Archer to pick up girls . How do you know that ? I ... I 'm already there . Vanessa . How you doing , Hugo ? I am doing just fine . I am construct- - I am constructing an antivirus , and as soon as we have that artifact ... That 's your department , Artie . We should be able to cure everyone afflicted . That 's great . Thanks . Based on the rate of deterioration of the previous victims , everyone in this store has less than six hours to live , including Hugo . This is the last place to record an artifact disturbance . Richard Nixon 's shoes are gone . So , I don 't know . Maybe I put ' em on so I could lie to Steve without him knowing . We have to find them . And none of these- - none of these explain what happened between us . Look , we aren 't the first platonic friends to ever get wasted and end up in bed together . I would never do that ! I ... God , I don 't think of you that way . And I don 't think of you that way , either . It 's just you 're my partner and--and--and my best friend , okay ?

Ahem . [ Coughing ] Thank you . Oh . Seems I 'm about to give new meaning to the phrase " Dirt nap . " You 're not gonna die , Hugo . We 're gonna--we 're gonna figure this thing out . I know . I 've got a lot to live for . You know , when I was in the sanitarium , I apparently drew the same picture every single day . I found one of them in my wallet after you restored my mind last year . Ahem . There . Huh . So much time lost . If I had it all back , I 'd spend every second of it with her . You 'd be a fool not to . Oh . Did you ever find someone , Artie ? Emet . Oh . I didn 't realize you were homosexual . Uh , are you what they call a bear ? No , I don 't mean Emmett , the man . I 'm talking about " Emet . " Look , Emet , the Hebrew word for " Truth . " It 's on his necklace . What does it mean ? It means that what we are facing is the artifact that 's behind the Jewish myth of the Golem . 16th century Prague , the Rabbi Judah Loew wanted to save the Jews of the ghetto from pogroms , and so he constructed- - he created a creature- - a Golem- - Hugo , entirely made of clay . And he put the word Emet , truth , on the Golem 's forehead to bring it to life . Animating the inanimate . And I think maybe the necklace is making the computer virus come to life exactly the same as the Golem . Somehow , I think that the myth and the virus got mixed up together , so that when he uses the virus on people 's computers ... It turned them to clay . Well thought out , Artie . It 's the necklace . I got him . Oh , my God . Hey , hey , hey , hey ! What the hell are you doing ? Oh , my God ! He 's got a gun ! Take it easy , Colin . No .

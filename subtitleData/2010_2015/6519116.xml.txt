You wait for them to take attendance , then you skip . You stick around here till three and then I take you home . [ speaks Tauron ] I 've decided to accept responsibility for my company 's impact on society . - [ Sarno ] Daniel Graystone . - [ applause ] My company will make no more profit on the Holobands or V-World licensing . That 's 60 % of our net . Hold me to it , Caprice . [ Tamara ] 5 woke up in the virtue ! work ! Without knowing how I got here . 5 need to find someone who can show me the Way home . If this is a dream , I think it 's too long . I don 't think this is a dream . This is the door , all right ? Come on , you 'll be free . [ Joseph ] Tamara 's avatar was my last hope of getting her back . Remember , it 's going to seem real , but it 's all virtual . Tamara ! - Tamara is really gone ? - I 'm sorry , but we can 't save them . [ Sam speaks Tauron ] Morning . Anybody home ? Hey , what are you doing here ? It 's a school day . Yoseef , get up . Yoseef . Yoseef . I said get up . Come on , up . - Hey . - [ Sam ] Come on . - Where are you going ? - Taking Willie to school . - I 'll take him . - It 's all right . He 's late . No , just hang on a second . I 'll get changed . Dad , it 's OK . I kind of want Uncle Sam to take me . Go wait . You going to work today ? - You going to work today ? - Yeah . It 's been a rough couple of weeks . - It 's not as bad as it looks . - No ? ' Cause it looks pretty frakked up . - Why don 't you mind your own business ? - This isn 't business . This is family ! You 're a Tauron , Yoseef . You remember that ' ? No . No , I 'm a Caprican . Isn 't that what you always tell me ? Hm ! You call yourself whatever you want , but first you be a father . And when you can manage that , maybe I 'll introduce you to your son . - No , I ... - Wake up , brother . Come on . [ sighs ] - [ dance music ] - Um ... excuse me . - I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . - [ man ] Hey , what the frak ? - [ woman ] Hey ! - Thanks . I 'm sorry . - [ man ] Watch it . - I 'm looking for someone named Vesta . - I know she 's here . - How did you get to the front ? - There a problem here ' ? - [ man ] Pushing her way through . [ Tamara ] I need to talk to Vesta . Look , I am stuck here and I can 't get out . I heard she can help me get home . Please just let me talk to her . If she can 't help me , I will leave . OK , we 'll let you talk to her . But we get to watch . [ Vesta ] Here we go . Here we go . One thousand . Put your bets down . Let 's go . OK . A thousand ? Is this all you 're gonna bet ? OK . OK , let 's play . Let 's play . Yeah ? We got a taker . Bad dress . - Claims she 's stuck . - OK . 1,500 to you . Grip , pull ... - Fire . - [ gunshot ] [ cheering ] What just happened ? Where did he go ? He de-rezzed . He 's gone . - Gone where ? - Wherever . Home . Home ... - I wanna play . - You 're the girl who can 't get out . - People have been talking about you . - Look , I need to get outside . I need to go home . Can you please help me ? - Take off your band , baby . - I can 't ! [ man ] She 's not de-rezzing . - [ man ] What 's up with her ? - Vesta . Vesta , she didn 't de-rezz . [ man ] No way . It 's freaking me out , man . Hm . What do we have here ? - [ man ] She 's not de-rezzing . - Shh . - [ woman ] It 's true . - Shh . It 's gonna be all right . You and I are gonna help each other . Shh . [ Vesta ] The pain should zap you out of the program and you have to relaunch your avatar , but you ... - [ Tamara ] Can 't . - Don 't have to . She 's a sleeper . It 's supposed to be a myth . Someone who fell asleep with their Holoband on and can 't wake up . Somebody would have woken me up by now . Maybe you 're unconscious , in a coma . There must be something wrong with your band . It should have timed out . But we can hack it , do a manual disconnect . There 's some kind of price , isn 't there ? What do you want me to do ? Play a little game , that 's all . - A game ? - Yeah . Help me settle an old score . You play the game , I get you home . She 's not bleeding . I 've never seen anyone heal before . - Not in V-World . - [ Vesta ] Clean her up . Get her some new clothes . You 're going now . - { phone rings ] - [ sports commentary on TV ] Yes , hi . This is Joseph Adama . This is Principal Andrews calling to check on Willie . - What ? - He 's been out sick . No , no , no . He 's been at school . Well , he 's missed several days in a row now . You 've gotta be ... How long ? Since the middle of last week . Oh , my gods . I get that . That 's simple . It 's so ... Put the tray down , take the apron off and come with me . Why don 't we go out back ? It 's quieter there . We could talk . We 've got nothing to talk about . You frakking pinon blax . That 's nice . A little Tauron comes in useful once in a while , doesn 't it ? - Let 's go . - Here 's a little Tauron saying for you . - I did not lose my son . - Oh , really ? Then what are you doing here ? [ Tamara ] Where are you taking me ? [ boy ] This tunnel leads us to a different section of V-World . It 's a first-player game . Once we 're there , we 'll take out a big player . Clean out his in-game bank account like a ... like a heist . None of us can come close to pulling this off ' cause this guy 's got security . That 's not gonna be a problem for you , OK ? - What are you talking about ? - You 'll see . Now get ready . Here we go . [ car alarms wail ] I 'm outside . Wait . Is this Caprice ? [ boy ] It 's a virtual Caprica , a digital recreation , but it 's lawless . anything goes . [ rattling ] - Get down ! - [ screams ] What is this place ? ! Welcome to New Cap City . So this whole city is like a game ? Yeah . It 's kind of like a different version of Caprica City . They update it so it matches . Even the place where the MAGLEV train blew up is here . A MAGLEV train blew up ? - How long have you been sleeping ? - I don 't know . OK , what 's the object of the game ? It 's a mystery . It 's almost like figuring out the object of the game is the object of the game . But we think it 's about getting things that convert into points , like money , - or weapons ... - So no one 's ever finished it ? - Or won it ? - Not yet . There 's this thing . When you die in the game , you 're out and you can 't ever come back . But with you , I might actually have a shot . OK , so our target is Chiron . He 's a fat cat . Likes to hang in this club on the lower east side . - To you . - Cheers . Bottoms up . Back booth . Don 't look , just glance . It 's Chiron . The horse . Best gamer in the city . You 're gonna pull security away and I 'll grab his avatar , OK ? If he 's the competition , why don 't you just kill him ? His avatar is more useful to us . It gets us into his vault , then we have his money . His virtual money . Well , that 's how you win the game . - You think . - That 's right . The deal is , you help us win the game and Vesta gets you home . Look , it 's not real , OK ? It is to me . [ boy ] You 're gonna pull security away and I 'm gonna grab his avatar . Chiron . You forgot to call me . I can forgive you if you play it right . I 'm sorry , dear . I have no idea who you are . Now get the hell out of here . No , you have to remember . I mean , come on . It was so sweet . You said that I could have anything that I wanted . Don 't you remember what I said ? I said that ... I said ... [ sobs ] - [ man ] She didn 't get sent back . - [ woman ] What 's going on ? [ man ] She should have de-rezzed already . The game should have kicked her back . What ? Come on , come on . It 's OK , all right ? We 're gonna be OK . You did good . You did great . You did great . That just blows my mind . Well , was it worth it ? Did you get what you needed ? Yeah . We totally did . Look , just watch me now , Don 't ... Don 't be scared . [ whirring ] You see ? It 's still just me . Anything that 's pure code can be manipulated . Now we can get into his bank vault , lift his virtual cash and convert it into points in the game . [ whirring ] So we pull that off and Vesta helps you . Look ... I know this must seem really random to you but this game , it really does mean something to me . It actually allows me to be ... something . Maybe if you weren 't in here playing this game , you could be something out there too . [ Willie ] You look goofy . You 're gonna embarrass me . [ Joseph ] I know there 's a great spot just ... [ Willie ] This is so boring . Let 's just go home , please . [ Joseph ] You 're gonna be so happy when we 're eating it . Delicious fish . Come on . You know , we haven 't been here in a long time . Since , uh ... since we came here with your mom and Tammy last summer . That was a great day . They were practically jumping on the line . [ sighs ] - Do you remember that ? - Not really . Listen , Willie , if you ever wanna talk about anything , about Mommy or Tammy ... [ boy ] Hey , what are you looking at ? I 'm here for you . You know that , right ? Yeah . Um , could we just go home , please ? - There 's no water . - What are you talking about ? This is ... The less water , the closer the fish are to the surface . Everybody knows that . Come on , get your rod . Look at the little Tauron dirt-eater . - You 've been unreachable for a day . - I 'll call you back . And your assistant won 't look me in the eye . I think it 's time you told me what 's going on . The board called an emergency meeting . I 've been trying to figure out who 's behind it . Hm . - Is it Atkinson ? - Well , it 's everyone . But , yeah , Atkinson , and Parker 's gonna be the one doing the talking . The others 'll sit on their hands , let him go on about the stock price tanking , your decision to give up the V-World lic ... So if I don 't come up with answers to the Holoband crisis , they 're going to try to force me to step down from my own company . [ Cyrus sighs ] Do they , uh ... Do you think they have the votes ? - Can we just go , please ? I wanna go . - Just wait a little longer . Don 't you love the fresh air and the beauty out here ? It 's much better than that smoke-filled room at Goldie 's . It 's so boring . Can we please go ? I don 't like it here . Can we please go ? Looks like it 's gonna be dirt again tonight . Just , listen , ignore that . They 're idiots . - [ Willie ] You talking to me ? - Who else would I be talking to ? Hey , Willie , just ignore them . Willie , put that down . - It must be fun to have all that dirt . - Willie . - Really ? - Willie , get back here right now ! Willie ! Hey ! No ! - [ boy ] Get him ! Get him ! - [ Joseph ] Willie ! - [ Joseph ] Hey ! Hey ! - [ girl ] Get him off ! Come here . Stop it , Willie ! No ! Come here ! Did I wake you up ' ? No . I wasn 't sleeping . Not really . Maybe a few minutes . What 's going on ? [ sighs ] I ... I think that , uh , I might be losing my company tomorrow . It 's ... Do you remember when I was pregnant with Zoe ? We were living in that flat in Cloverdale . And you were taking the bus all over town because that car that you loved never worked . It worked . We hadn 't paid the rent for like three months . You couldn 't afford even upper-level Bucs tickets . Things were really bad . But you had a big fat meeting with MicroCap . And you knew nobody wanted to see you in there , but you didn 't care . Someone had done you a favour . So you worked on that thing for months , and on the day of the meeting , you fell in the pouring rain getting off the bus . - You slipped helping some woman ... - Now I remember . ... with a stroller , and you landed on your ass on the sidewalk . So you walked into that meeting in a soaking wet suit and what turned out to be a broken wrist , and you walked out of there with the deal that would start everything . [ man ] You can 't change the fact that he went on that show and killed the Holoband business . Well , he didn 't stick to the script , but on the flip side , our approval ratings sky-rocketed . Exactly . And you think dumping the founder of this company now , in the middle of all this , you think that 's going to help ? Daniel Graystone is the brand . He 's the public face of this corporation ... [ thudding ] - What is that ? - [ thudding continues ] [ Daniel ] Hello , everyone . I 'm so sorry I 'm late . Uh , Daniel , I 'd just like to say we all understand you 're going through an awful lot right now . - Holobands are over . - Excuse me ? Holobands are over ? The hacked sites are eating up more and more of our market share each quarter , and that 's where the kids are going , because they 're free . And the next generation coming up , they 'll expect it all to be free . We can 't own it forever . We can either marshal all our resources and funds towards saving that sinking ship , or we can look for the next big thing , the next big leap forward that will change the worlds . We either move into the future or we die trying to hold on to our past . And this , this is our future . Fancy machines that cost millions of cubits ? The cost is irrelevant , considering all that it can do . U-87 , make the circuit , please . Take a nice look at all these fine folks . Looks a little uncomfortable , doesn 't it ? Do you find yourself wondering what it might be thinking , or feeling ? Well , that is the big leap forward , people . Do you sense it ? Beyond artificial intelligence , this is artificial sentience . Do you feel it ? I feel it . Don 't you ? I feel like there is a being inside this machine , something alive and vital . And special . It 's not our imagination . Look at the test results . There is a brilliant mind in here . So in terms of practical applications ... Are you seriously asking me about the practical applications of creating another race that will walk beside us ? [ chuckles ] Do you not understand the enormity of this creation ? It 's more than a machine . This Cylon will become a tireless worker who won 't need to be paid . It won 't retire or get sick . It won 't have rights or objections or complaints . It will do anything and everything we ask of it without question . U-87 , rip your arm off . Go on . Go on . Looked a little painful , didn 't it ? The desire to anthropomorphise , the need to connect , it 's powerful . And that is why this thing is going to sell . We make them . We own them . They 're real . And the worlds just changed . So I believe you were going to take a vote ? [ whirring ] Wait . Take a powder . I said blow . [ door opens ] [ door closes ] This place is a bank ? Where did the security go ? And where 's the vault ? The guards were pure code , not players . They are the security . They scanned the Chiron avatar and it passed . As for the vault , we 're standing on it . Vesta decoded the sequence from a puzzle across town . It was encoded on manhole covers . Really tough to get , but we got it . So I 'll just name off the signs and you step on them as I go , OK ? - [ Tamara ] OK , just hurry up . - All right , you ready ? - Yeah . - Picon . - [ musical note plays ] - Caprica . - [ musical note plays ] - Gemenon . - [ musical note plays ] - Picon . - [ musical note plays ] - Tauron . - [ musical note plays ] - [ whirring ] See how this registers as points ? It 's gotta mean something . This has to be the point of the game . [ alarm rings ] Oh , frak . - How 'd you do that ? - I don 't know . Gods , what are you ? [ Joseph ] Willie , do your homework . [ sighs ] Willie , stop that . Stop it ! [ knocking ] What have you been teaching him , Sam ? Same things we 've been taught . He 's gonna be a man soon , Yoseef . On Tauron , at his age , he already would be . He 's gonna make choices . - I don 't know what to do , Sam . - You know what to do , Yoseef . It 's what you 've been thinking about . It 's what you 've been avoiding . Too Tauron for you maybe , but not for your son . You 're losing him . You are losing him , Yoseef . Your son needs closure . It 's time to let Shannon and Tamara go . Look past yourself and perform the rites , brother . [ Cyrus ] You got the votes . You better be right . Indistinct news reports ] [ doorbells chime ] [ speaks Tauron ] Welcome to our home . Tsattie , what 's taking so long ? - What are you doing ? Get out of here . - [ mutters ] - Just ... - I know what they 're for . GO , go : You ready ? I 'm ready . [ woman ] I Inside my mind I Shades of vision I Fading photograph ... - [ boy ] You sure moved in fast . - Did you get it ? She was amazing . Stopped the guards , messed with the codes . Like hacking without even hacking . Really ? Interesting . Bring it to me . No . You 're gonna wake me up , get me home and then you get your money . Yeah , well , see , I 've been looking into that , and ... I can 't . It 's only a month old . It 's yellowing , but you can still make out the names on the list . What a shame . Tamara Adams , 16 years old . 615 Olympic Street , number 3 , Caprica City . Isn 't that you , baby ? $ 0 young . Wait . I don 't get it . What ... What 's the list ? - What 's the list of ? - It doesn 't matter . You 're dead , baby . Does that explain why she can do what she did to the guards ? I think it might . [ woman ] You 're not going home , doll face . [ Vesta ] Don 't worry . We 've got plenty for you to do , baby . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . You need to go to the real world . You need to find my father . You know the address . You heard it . 615 Olympic , number 3 . I 'll wait for you in New Cap City so you can find me . - I can 't go back to the real world , OK ? - You could be something there . Just take off your Holoband , OK ? You 're not gonna die here . Just go . What are you ? I 'm awake . Do you have a coin for me , Yoseef ? I have a coin for my wife , Shannon Adama . I have a coin for my sister , Tamara Adama . Will you grant them passage ? They will have passage . Will you let them go ? Yes . Yes . Will you bid them farewell ? Goodbye , Shannon . Goodbye , Tamara . Goodbye , Tamara . Goodbye , Mom . Then they will live forever in peace . They will live forever in your hearts . [ woman sings in Tauron ] [ doorbells chime ] I got it . That 's a good one . Hi . Can I help you ? Hey . Are you , uh , Joseph Adams ? It 's Adama . How can I help you ? Tamara sent me . What are you talking about ? She gave me this address , right ? OK , look , she 's in V-World and she can 't get out . - If you can just help me ... - You saw her ? Yeah , but I think she 's just sleeping or something . So if you could just please go wake her up , she really needs that . My daughter 's dead . She died in the MAGLEV attacks . Oh , gods . I 'm sorry . You saw her in V-World ? You gotta take me there . You gotta take me to see her . OK ? Hey ... Hey ! Stop ! Stop ! Oh ! Oh ... Hey ! Tammy .

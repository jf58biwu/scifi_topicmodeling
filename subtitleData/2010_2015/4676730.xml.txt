 - Previously on Alphas ... - What are you doing here ? He isn 't coming , Dani . I don 't know what you 're talking about . - Parish . - Dani ... I have to take you into custody now . I want you to lay face down . Easy . - Cameron ... - You turned her in ! Please understand , if I had any other option , I would- - She 's your kid . You 're supposed to protect her ! This isn 't the end , Dani . It 's- - there 's an opportunity here . Yes , there is a way out . She come up with that brilliant idea herself , Doc , or you head-shrink that into her ? That 's uncalled for . We 're all just trying to wrap our heads- - You put your own daughter 's head on the block , and I 'm out of order ? Your father should have never sent you back to Parish . Now we 're getting out of here . I didn 't come back here for my father . - Dani- - - No , Cam . This is my chance to do something good . I 'm standing on top of your bomb . Dani , you 're not supposed to be there . I can 't let you kill millions of people . My sweet Danielle , fighting for what she believes in . Good-bye . Run ! Do not ... Die . The choices can feel overwhelming . One always wants the best for one 's child . Please , take your time . Hicks , need anything ? No . You gotta eat , bro . We 're order some food . Yeah , I 'm not hungry . Thanks . Hicks , you could try screaming . 'Cause I--you 're angry about Dani like I 'm angry about Anna . And the screaming , it 's cathartic . That 's why I do it in the mornings . Hicks , I could- - I could show- - - Gary ... - I could show you how to do it . He needs some time . - Oh . How much time ? - I don 't know . I 've barely slept . I just keep on picturing it ... Dani dying . I know . She was holding my hand , and- - What ? I felt everything she felt . How precious it all is . How fast . I just still can 't believe it . Me neither . How is he ? We 're giving him time . But we don 't know how much . The poor guy never slept last night . He was walking around my house till 3 : 00 in the morning . He 's strong . He 'll be okay . Anyway , let 's , uh- - let 's get organized around this , okay ? Rosen 's head isn 't in it , so we need to stay on top of this investigation . No , Bill , it 's the weekend . Gary , that doesn 't matter anymore . Well , we need copies of every document , every file . - You 're here . - Well , this is our office . Yeah , and it 's my apartment too . I just figured after what happened , you 'd--you 'd all take some time . And what , it 'd be the perfect time for you to just sneak in here ? Nobody 's sneaking . The D.O.D. wants all the intel on the Parish organization . Oh , you mean Dr. Rosen 's intel . Yes . His daughter 's death is a terrible tragedy . And I 'm gonna rip that organization apart so they don 't hurt anybody else . So what , exactly , do you need ? - He needs to get out of here . - We need everything . Starting in Dr. Rosen 's office . Cley , come on . This isn 't right . - Rosen doesn 't trust him . - Right . He wouldn 't let him go through his stuff like that . Guys , listen , I don 't agree with this either . I don 't like this , but obviously , they can help us get to Parish . So let 's give them what they need , but keep an eye on them , all right ? Let 's get to work . Gary , we could use your help . - Agent Bell . - Okay , Agent Bell , can you download all the digital files from the investigation ? Download . That 's a waste of my ability . Hey , man , my guys could do it , but it 'd take them hours . You can do it in ten minutes . Ten minutes . I could do it quicker than that . Great . So will you ? No , it 's lunch . I get pizza today . So I 'll do it after . Maybe . Cley wanted an inventory on all the physical evidence we collected on Parish . Add it to the pile . Thanks . Can I help ? It 's okay . I 'm almost done . I hate that we 're doing this . Well , maybe you should just go home . It 's actually a beautiful day . We should enjoy them when we can . Okay . Hey . Hey . What are you doing here ? Well , I was looking for you . I wanted to see if you were okay . I mean , I know you 're not okay . It 's just ... A crappy day , huh ? Thank you . I can 't tell you how good it is to see you . You want to get some coffee or something ? Take me home . My parents are in New Jersey , at my uncle 's . Oh , um ... Yeah . Okay . Is Dr. Rosen on the fifth floor ? I need to see him . Oh , oh , no , he 's not that kind of doctor . No , you don 't understand . He has to help me . Do you know him ? Yeah , he 's my boss , but he 's not here right now . You work at that place that helps Alphas ? You 're not supposed to know about us . You should go away and then come back another time . No , I can 't . I can 't come back , okay ? Here , take him . No . - Take him ! Please . - No , no , don 't- - no , no , no- - - Please . He 's special . Yeah . Okay , okay . But I 'm not gonna take- - hey ! Hey , don 't--no ! Don 't--oh , oh . I can 't take this . Where are you going ? Oh ...

So push me , and then I 'll forget her . Cam , I can 't do that . You mean you won 't . I know how you feel . No , you don 't ! I know how much she loved you . Just go . Eh , eh , eh . Eh , eh , eh . Is that a baby ? What the hell- - Gary . Gary , whose baby is that ? Oh , I don 't know . Some lady gave him to me downstairs , told me to take care of him . I already looked up how . A lady . What--what lady ? I don 't know . She didn 't tell me her name . She didn 't tell me his name either . But I think he looks like a Kyle . Or a Benjamin . Gary , what are you talking about ? I 'm talking about what just happened to me , Bill , downstairs . I have to use a steady , rhythmic , soothing motion . Doka doka doka . Doka doka doka . Doka doka doka . Ha . Look , Bill , it works . Doka doka doka . Doka doka doka . I 'm sorry , sir , no entry . I understand . Thank you , sir . You know , Homeland Security 's already searched the place . Yes , I 'm aware of that . I want to make sure they haven 't missed anything . - There you go , sir . - Thank you . Please state your name for the record . Lee Rosen . Lee , thank you for coming in today . On behalf of our entire department , please accept our condolences . Thank you . I know this is a difficult time for you , but we find that recollections are most accurate within 24 hours after an event . I understand . We 're here to review the course of events that culminated in the act of domestic terrorism in Weehawken , New Jersey , and resulted in a number of casualties , including the death of government informant Danielle Sara Rosen .

She goes into the alleyway , and then you can 't see her anymore . So there 's no way to contact her . Gary , listen , I need you to do a face grab- - Bill , I know what you need me to do , but I can 't- - I only have two hands . I 'm trying to give Benjamin , or Kyle , his food here . - Gary . - Okay , I 'll look for it . Thank you . Are you sure she said she can 't come back ? Yeah , and that he 's very special . And that he should be here . That 's why she brought him here . 'Cause he must be an Alpha . I wonder what his ability is . He 'll probably go fly off somewhere . No , Bill , come on . Even Alpha babies can 't fly . Can you- - can you fly ? Can you fly ? I 'm kidding . I 'm joking with you . What is this , daddy daycare ? No , I 'm not his daddy . Agent Bell , you get those downloads for me ? No , ' cause I have to feed him , and then I have to burp him . Then I 'll probably have to clean up after him . What 's the status on Parish ? The status is we 're all over this . Oh , so you 're looking for him , huh ? Hell yeah . Probably not gonna find him here . Hicks , you know how long it takes to get 19 federal agencies up and moving ? We 're bringing in the big guns , but it takes some time to get the big guns rolling . Rosen warned you about Parish a year ago . And then he almost kills millions of people , and that 's what it finally takes to light a fire under the government 's ass . And you think you 're gonna come in here and start giving us orders ? No way Rosen 's gonna take this ! Cam . Rosen invited us . He reached out to me . What ? Told me I had free access to all the intel . The investigation is not gonna be run by this team . Rosen agreed to that . Son of a bitch . Hicks , wait . Cley , what are you talking a- - Okay , yeah , I found her . Someone tagged a photo . Somewhere tropical . We 're gonna need a name , Gary . Bill , come on . Your hands are too big . Don 't . Don 't . Get out of there . All right , all right . Yeah , Magda Ryan . It 's somewhere sunny , though , like Bermuda , Bahamas . We got a name . We also have the parents . They 're waiting outside . They 're here ? Oh , thank God . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Mr. and Mrs ... Kessler . I 'm Brian , this is Jane . And that 's Adam , our son . He doesn 't look like an Adam . Thank you for looking after him . One second , please . We need to work this thing out . What do you mean " work this thing out " ? Jane Kessler ... And , uh ... Brian Kessler . We came as soon as we knew Magda took him . His nanny . Is that this woman here ? - Yes , that 's her . - She 's so fired . I know we have to , but she 's been so good with him . Took him without our permission , and then she abandoned him . She thought she was helping . You believe this ? Why did she bring him here ? She watched that video of the doctor talking about Alphas . Lee Rosen . You know , the one where he 's in front of the Senate committee . Yes , I am aware . She was obsessed with the idea that Adam was one of those people . One of those people ? Alphas . She kept on pressuring us to get Dr. Rosen to examine him . How did you find us ? We found this address in her room . What , exactly , is this place , anyway ? We 're government consultants . We don 't want to get her in trouble . We just want our son . That was , um ... It was good . It was very good . - Yeah . - Yeah . Yeah , it was great . Thank you for coming over . I felt a bit alone , so ... I appreciate it . You 're welcome . But oh , yeah , I- - Um , you ... You feel like some dinner or- - Sure . Um ... You first . Right . Of course . After Danielle 's arrest , she was returned to Stanton Parish as a covert operative . Uh , Department of Defense . Her assignment was to provide intelligence for you- - for your department- - in exchange for a pardon of her crimes . And you were in support of that agreement ? Yes , I was . When Danielle returned to the Parish organization as a covert operative , she was confident that he would not question her loyalty . She 'd been a disciple of his , so to speak . Yes , so to speak . Dr. Rosen , in your opinion , how does a man like Stanton Parish attract so many followers ? What did your daughter see in him ? Stanton Parish is a master manipulator . He is , quite frankly , a sociopath . He has a very charismatic personality . He preys upon people who , uh- - who , for whatever reason , are looking for a purpose in their life , and a sense of belonging . Particularly those who feel that they have lost some sort of connection ... With their friends or family . Hey , you don 't look like an Adam . I wish that you could tell me your name . I 'm--I 'm Gary Bell . You should know that , even though you can 't talk . Unless that 's your Alpha ability- - talking baby . I 'm kidding . I do that . Oh . Oh ... Huh . Gary . - What ? - Let 's go . The parents are here to pick up the kid . - What--no . - Time to go . No , Bill , we don 't even know if they are his parents . Birth certificates are legitimate , okay ? I looked online . No , Bill . They can fake birth certificates . Don 't do this to me today . No , no , no , Bill ! No , Bill , don 't do that . - What is wrong with you ? - Get out ! Get out ! And stay out . What the hell is wrong with you ? There 's nothing wrong with me , Bill . They 're not taking him . Gar Nina . They 're not taking him , Bill . Gary , come on , now . Open the door . This is so not the time . Maybe you should just break in . I don 't want to set him off . This is weird , even for Gary . Gary , we know you 're concerned about the baby , but you can 't keep him from his parents . Gary , you can check the I.D.s. Yeah , Bill , I already did check their I.D.s. Brian and Jane Kessler . But they only have drivers licenses . Yeah , it 's real suspicious , huh ? Yeah , it is suspicious , Bill , 'cause that 's all they have . I couldn 't find anything else . There 's no bank accounts or credit cards . And there 's no pictures of them with the baby . Come on , Gary . The lady gave him to me , so ... and she told me to take care of him . So that 's what I 'm gonna do . I 'm gonna take care of him . Something is off . Really off . Looks like you got a situation . Yeah , nothing we can 't handle . Listen , I 'm sorry we imposed on you today . But we 're done here for now . What does that mean ? Starting tomorrow , your offices will become our base of operations . Grand central for breaking the Parish organization . I thought you said we were off of the investigation . I said you weren 't in charge . We still need your help and expertise . We 're all after the same thing , aren 't we ? See you soon . There 's something with aliens at 8 : 00 , or there 's a chick flick at 9 : 15 . Obviously , you 're into the aliens . Obviously , but I 'm willing to sacrifice . John , you shouldn 't have to sacrifice . Seriously , I 'm fine with whatever . John ... you deserve better than fine . We both do . Listen , I think- - I don 't know , I think we just built it up too much . We just needed to get past the first time , that 's all . - You do ? - Yeah , absolutely . I mean , it wasn 't terrible . Oh , God . I just- - I mean , to me it felt like you were far away . Look , are you sorry that- - No . I wanted this . I wanted to be with you . I guess I expected it to be different this time . What do you mean ? I was 18 my first time . And when it happened , I felt so out of control . Just so overwhelmed by the sensations that I just completely shut down . It 's just always been like that . Well , Rachel , we 'll get there . Okay ? You 'll feel comfortable . You kept your shirt on . You don 't want to see my scars . No . You 're wrong . I do . My ex , um ... she tried to be there for me while I was recovering . She said she couldn 't stomach it . Is that how she put it ? Kinda hard to forget . Mm . Well ... I think ... you are ... beautiful . Baba ! What are you doing home ? Your uncle got on my nerves . This is John . Uh ... Sir . I 'll go check on her . Wow . Thank you . You left me all alone out there with your dad . - I 'm sorry . - Rachel , I 'm leaving the house . I 'm going shopping . I 'm going for ... Two hours . Oh , my God . No , no , it 's fine , 'cause you know what ? I think he liked me . Oh , shut up . We only have two hours . What do you think you 're doing here ? Making sure they haven 't missed anything important . - Taking inventory ? - Yeah . Yeah , in a word . Dani 's paintings and her belongings . Just want to make sure they 're protected . Wow . You want to protect her things . What are you doing here , Cameron ? Well , Cley 's back at our office rifling through our stuff . You 're seriously gonna trust this to him ? Yes . Yes , for now , I 'm letting the experienced authorities make all the decisions . No , you 're the experienced authority . Yeah , look where my expertise has led us . What , you 're just gonna hand this entire thing over to him ? Parish killed Dani ! I know that . You think I need you to tell me that ? She 's my daughter . She was . Now look at you just sitting there , not doing anything to find her killer . Well , where the hell do you think I should be ? Gary would never harm your baby . He 's just trying to protect him . - Protect him from what ? - It doesn 't make any sense . Gary 's autistic . It 's very hard for him to make connections with people . But for some reason , he 's found a connection with Adam . He 's been able to hold him . He 's been very caring . Which is very unusual for Gary , believe me . This is what I 'm thinking . What if your nanny was right ? What if Adam has some sort of ability that 's affecting Gary ? He 's an Alpha ? We don 't believe in that . Okay , well , let 's call Dr. Rosen- - No ! Rosen is able to reach Gary . He 'll be able to see whether there 's something that 's affecting him . Absolutely not . We don 't want that man anywhere near our child . That 's how this whole thing began . Fair enough . Why don 't you go take a seat in my office . Sit tight . We 'll get you and your son out of here . You got a half hour or we 're calling the police . We want our baby back . All right , we need to split them up and ask them some more questions . You ready to do your thing ? Oh , yeah . Well , the funny thing , Mr. Kessler , is we can 't seem to find any record of you or your wife . No home records , no loans ... What does that have to do with this ? Just get my son out of that room . I 'm afraid I 'm not gonna be able to do that just yet . What 's he talking to Brian about ? Just relax and tell me the truth . This tea is terrible . And I love your perfume . Are you the baby 's parents ? No . He doesn 't have real parents . Can I get some cream ? Who 's the lady who brought the baby to Gary ? She took care of the kid at the lab . Your friend 's in big trouble . You either knock down that door , or I call the police . You wanna call the police ? Call ' em . Go right ahead . They do stuff with genetics or something . I think they 've got four other babies now . Who sent you ? Mr. Murphy called and said , " get the kid out of here . " No muss , no fuss . " But if things get tricky , show them who they 're dealing with . " If you don 't want to call , I will . Yeah , I 'm one of those people . Bastard . Well , me too . I don 't think so . Bitch . - Do your thing . - He 's holding the kid . - Give him to me . - No . No way . Have it your way . Go to sleep . Bitch . Yeah , you see ? I told you . I was right . Yeah , Gary , you were right . They never listen to me . Dr. Rosen , if you will , please turn your attention to the final event in Weehawken . After the detonation of the voltaic grenades , several electrical towers were destroyed and ... All of the lights in the area had gone out . Danielle was in the direct path of the blast . Um ... Her injuries were- - were quite severe . Dani ? Dani , look at me . Look at me . Dani , I love you . And , uh ... She expired . It 's my responsibility , whatever happens to Cameron or Dani or anyone . It 's my responsibility . You shouldn 't have to carry that alone . Yes , I should . God . Lee , I 'm so sorry to have brought you here . That 's all right , Nina . Where 's Gary ? He 's in the lab . Gary , you have a very high level of vasopressin in your bloodstream , so- - Oh . That doesn 't sound good . It 's all right , Gary . It 's nothing to worry about . It 's a hormone that increases the instinct to protect one 's child . It 's typically found in high levels in new fathers . I 'm not his father . I only just met him today . Yes , I know . I just believe that Adam here- - No , Benjamin . Or Kyle . Well , whatever his name is has the ability to induce production of the hormone in anyone who 's nearby- - in close proximity or in contact with him . It doesn 't necessarily have to be the birth parent either . He can inspire ... inspire what all babies need ... care and protection . Hi , Bill . - Good to see you , Doc . - You too . How 'd it go at the laboratory ? Well , they busted everyone . Of course , no one 's talking . They 're still looking for Magda , though . Are the other babies all right ? They seem to be . They placed ' em all in secure foster homes . Well , I should probably have a look at them too . Gary , this is a vasopressin antagonist . It will reduce the concentration in your bloodstream very quickly . - I have to drink this ? - Yes , please . - That--come on . - Just hold your breath . - Eww , it 's filthy . - It 's not filthy , Gary . Magda must have taken that , right ? Unless she felt like this was the safest place for him . That makes sense . - Gary , you were incredible . - Huh . You protected him when we almost gave him away . Yeah , I was incredible . I protected him . - Gary , may I ? - Oh . Oh , yeah . You have to be careful . Hey , little one . Hi there . Can you squeeze my finger ? Hey . He had a rough day . He 's doing fine . He 's lucky he won 't remember it . Hopefully . He 'll learn young to put all the rough stuff behind him and move on with life . Right ? Huh , little guy ? - You have a go . - Come here . Hurts my back . Hey . Hey . Hmm ? Oh ... Better ? I think I figured out what your Alpha ability is . But we should keep practicing . Uh , isn 't your dad gonna be home soon ? I don 't care . What a day . No whining , Bill . We can only have one baby in the house . Are you sure you 're okay with this ? Are you kidding me ? I 'm still in shock that you are . Well , you know , sometimes life can be rough , but you just have to grab the good stuff when it happens , right ? Oh , and everyone thinks you 're such a tough guy . This is just until we find a safe place for him . We have a safe place for him . We don 't know anything about this kid . So we 're still gonna have to take that stuff , you know . No , I know , I know . Just look at him , Bill . He 's perfect . I know you blame me for all of this , Cameron . Well , I do too . I had her in my arms . I could have stopped her , but I let her go . Whatever you 're feeling right now , we did not kill her . Someone else did . He used her , then he killed her when she got in his way . You know that if Cley catches Parish , he 'll put him in prison . He doesn 't deserve to go to prison . No . No , he doesn 't . I 'm gonna need your help . = = sync , corrected by elderman = =

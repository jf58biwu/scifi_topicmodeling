 I don 't want to die . I don 't want to die . Oeufcocque ! I 'm so sorry ! Oeufcocque ? Balot ! Doctor ... Here I am ! Hurry to the Doctor ! Oeufcocque ? How is that girl any different from me ? Why did Oeufcocque leave me ? It was you who left him ! We developed this place : Flying House Humpty . I 've been granted permission to use it for a limited time . You 're safe now . Please ! Let me see Oeufcocque ! I want to apologize ! I don 't want to be here ! Let me go to where he is ! I want ... to live . Rune-Balot . They say your Snark abilities have 80 % passed the liminality threshold . That 's amazing . I talk up here . see . It 's tiring to breathe . My name is Tweedledee . This is Paradise . It used to be a military research facility . Welcome to the land where forbidden technology was given birth ... This makes you and I brother and sister ! Let me see Oeufcocque and the Doctor . Do you need something ? let me see them ! I wonder if the other professors would get angry if someone outside their group went in the lab ... right ? I see ! Okay ! Are all the people from outside like you ? What do you mean ? who knows about everything . I wonder if Adam felt this way when Eve handed him the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge ? I just can 't resist ! Why are you here ? Because of my disability . so I became a resident of Paradise . The Doctor worked here ? that one of the Three Professors created . Three Professors ? The top members of Paradise . and only one remains . Dee . Who 's the girl ? I 'm showing her around . Rune Balot . Easter did ? That codename hasn 't been registered . The metabolic-metallic fibrous state is quite good . I 'd like to have tea with someone of such high compatibility . We 're sort of in a hurry ... You have to get the biorhythm stabilized . thank you very much . young lady . Their " tea parties " last a long time . They put a bunch of meds in there for their testing . Twee ? Dr. Easter . What 's wrong ? Balot 's here to see you . Twee ! Where is Oeufcocque ? Don 't worry ... It 's just that I don 't think he 'd want you to see him the way he is now . I want to apologize . Please ! Hey ! She 's just going to say hi . Are they talking ? I 'm sorry ... It was my failure that caused this to happen ... I love you . Did Oeufcocque say that ? she did . can I take her to the pool ? right ? After you explain to Balot . I know . after all . What do you think ? Wow ... What about those people ? They 've forgotten how to move . The same way I 've forgotten how to breathe . Come here ! I 'll introduce you to my lover . Lover ? I get such a kind feeling when we 're together ... What ? Who 's that ? It 's someone I don 't know ! Rune-Balot . She 's Oeufcocque 's lover . Miss . I 'm Tweedledum . Gonna ride on my back ? I 'll make you scream like a little baby ! Is she a girl ? Nope . You 're a human . You shouldn 't be trapped by such narrow preconceptions . and his lover . We 're homosexual partners ! We do what we can . Do you know what you 're saying ? What 's that eye ? don 't you think ? It 's an Access Organ . Access ? You 'll understand if you go for a swim . Take a dip . It should be good for your muscular rehabilitation . Understood . You 're going to swim with your clothes on ? I 'll take them off if I feel like it . Hold on tight ! Welcome to a totally different ocean ! What 's that ? Those are communication nuclei . They 're connected to terminals around the world . too ? Yup . let 's search for it together . There is something Oeufcocque and the Doctor are searching for . I want to find it for them . You do ? What are you searching for ? named Shell . You 're going to eat the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge on your own accord ? What 'll you do ? Wait a bit . I 'll introduce you to God . God ? One of the Three Professors . just like God . Are you friends with Oeufcocque ? Yeah . He 's a good guy . so I think he makes a pretty decent lover ! I don 't think he feels that way . is it ? he is an indecisive fellow . Give him time . Patience will persevere . { } I tried to use him recklessly . he protected me . So that 's why he 's here for maintenance . It 's my fault . don 't worry . Immortal ? He can 't die ? His body is multidimensionally constructed . Even if he 's injured he can regenerate from another dimension . since he 's an organic unit . For so long ? What do you mean ? Hypertrophy . it gains weight . it will be crushed by its own weight and die . He 's ill ? It 's a necessity of life . knowing about his own death is what gave rise to the reason he left Paradise . What 's that supposed to mean ? Who knows ? after all . Don 't you ever want to ? And how would I survive ? and my brother . too ? right ? I 've made my decision . I wonder what the real ocean is like ? Thanks for waiting . Rune-Balot . I am the top manager here . Everyone calls me Professor Faceman . Manipulate the cage so we can talk . Okay . I 've taken a look at your data . My data ? The condition for using this place was for Oeufcocque to offer the data he recorded . Um ... I think of myself as a test subject . it 's just a matter of prolonging my life . Prolonging your life ? I cut off my body which was being eaten away by cancer . I think this form is more suited to me . Isn 't it inconvenient ? It 's delightful ! All the functions I need are built into this cage . as well . Um ... I really get a sense for Dr. Easter 's amazing talent . he and everything else was rejected . What happened ? Limitations were put on this facility by the government . Each of we Three Professors who were the top managers thought up our own countermeasures . 09 . Another created the October Corp. in conflict with them . Conflict ? you see . and only a small bit of the brain of the other one is alive . And what about you ? I will remain forever locked away in this place . chose to enter the cage myself ; and visitors here are also placed under the same restrictions . Understood . you will become a suspected criminal . the suspicion can be lifted . Understood . then I want to try . So be it . we 'll do nothing but sit back and watch as a spectator . Thank you very much . Easter . Professor . It 's not my intention to make you a federal criminal . use my name - Please teach me how you fight ! Eve became aware of her own nakedness . she 's an airhead . but I found out their secret . I 'll use her as my bargaining chip . The marriage registration ? After the contract 's signed . what about that job ? I wounded one of the ambulance chasers . I 'll continue to pursue them . But something is odd . Everything 's odd ! Because a dead woman in my dreams is trying to get in the way of my deals ! The next trial will be another blank slate . It 's possible they 're looking for the key behind your deals . didn 't you ? Where are you hiding them ? None of your fucking business ! Shut up ! Kill her . Kill that bitch who 's chasing after me ! Why am I ... Why am I afraid of that girl ? What 's scary about women ? Again with women ... Boss ... Are you on drugs ? I 'm used to handling ' em . Got some here . This is some high quality Heroic Pill . Want one ? I have no need . damn ! When do you fucking sleep ? I have forgotten how to sleep . I haven 't slept for nine years . No wonder they call you Mr. Ironman . where are we headed ? Paradise . Fuck yeah ! We got a hit ! Eggnog Blue ! now try accessing deeper . There are a lot of logs about memory disabilities . Looks like there are traces that have been modified from the outside . Data 's been remotely deleted . There are holes left where the data was deleted ! Let 's chase after them ! Incredible ... The communication nuclei and her ability adapted themselves to each other ... They 're dancing . Looks like fun . We have visitors . An inspector has demanded an examination through the legal affairs bureau . Boiled ? ! I have no need for her to be disrupted with her data yet incomplete . Tweedledee . You 're going to use Twee ? I 've studied how to come into contact with outside humans . I 'm looking forward to it . That 's a surprising twist ! Go in from the west . All action is approved . It 's a fictional " twist . Answer my question . Where are you sheltering Oeufcocque and that girl client ? We shelter no one . All we do is take people in . What are Oeufcocque and the others trying to find out about Shell ? I will not tell one who cannot think of himself as anything more than a murderer ! And what do you know ? and treats people as mere objects ... It 's precisely because I know . This is the winning battle . People know in the bottom of their hearts that there is nothing that has actual value . yes ? Is that cast-off shell who you are now ? Your pseudo-gravity was developed here . We here do not know what Oeufcocque and the others are looking into . Why won 't your client tell you ? someone who has even thrown away the feeling of trust ? Whoa ... This is what they call a storm ! but this is what they call a storm ! Why ... me ? That 's right ... The answer is in Shell 's memories ! Look at all the treasure ! What are you doing ? Hello . Who are you ? I see ! I get it now ... You 're the one who killed my buddies ! Inside your head is also hard ... Stop talking inside my head ! It 's been a while since I 've felt pain . definitely unpleasant . I 'll make your body to suit my taste ! Voice ... It 's been so long since ... I 've breathed ... What the hell are you ? you see . Don 't blame me for what happens . Everyone ! You can eat him ! The guardian angels of Paradise use pseudo-gravity to render all violence powerless . Boiled ! Save me ! I am no longer one of your test subjects . I am a beast which escaped Paradise . You are now just a highly curious shark seeking ever higher level methods of murder . Go now . Your feet will never again set foot outside of the wilderness . You 're leaving ? Yeah . Thanks for swimming with me . Do your best . I pray Lady Luck be with you . okay ? Balot ! You 're leaving . I 'll heal soon . I 'm sorry ... It was my fault ... as long as I made a friend . That 's right . I 'm glad you made a friend ! Stop it ! That 's a violation of federal law ... He shot . Smiling ... What ? Smiling like you made a friend . come again . far out in the Pacific . Aren 't you cold ? There 's no point to continue with the trial like this . We 've got to checkmate him before he ... Before he what ? Gets married . Into the October Corp. family ... Shell 's getting married ? He 's using it to shield himself from the records of his illegal dealings . Strange ... What do you want to do now after the incident ? I don 't really know . When will Oeufcocque die ? I didn 't euthanize him . Twee told me that Oeufcocque learned of his own death and left Paradise ! His lifespan is an unknown . The problem is how he lives . No one knows when they are going to die . But we all know we 're going to die sometime . I want to be beside him . Even after the incident ? Is your job meaningful ? I 'm satisfied with my life . Do you think I can be like that ? That 's a tough one ... right ? he 's strong . When I faced him before I was no match . But Boiled went on a rampage . He just went on a killing spree . And Oeufcocque ? Boiled also has metallic fibers transplanted into his hand . He used them to control Oeufcocque . rejected Boiled . Now they 're mutual enemies . I understand how that Boiled person must feel a little . right ? and I couldn 't quit by myself . You 're different than him . Will Oeufcocque forgive me ? Yes . You can learn . can I ask something ? Sure . About the memories that Shell hid ... Chips . Some of the ones in Shell 's casino . Inside the million dollar chips . Chips ? Using the super high value chips at his associated casino as a front ? He 's hiding a treasure inside a treasure ! How many chips are there ? 12 in total . Recording mediums are hidden inside 4 of them . and if they find out we 're searching they 'll change the hiding place ... Special investigation ... ? pretending to be normal customers would work best . Balot ! What ? Ever played around in a casino ? I 've only ever stood next to the men . Right ! some special lessons ! Got it ? Finite games can all be expressed as a standard system . choose a strategy ? and they grope around for a method to unbalance the game . What do you think you 're doing drilling Balot in economic theory ? Nothing good comes from making your partner feel inferior with your strengths . Balot ? Studying the Prisoner 's Dilemma ? Oeufcocque . You woke up a lot faster than I thought . Guess that upgrade Paradise 's tech got really helps . Could you please explain to me the current situation ? When you consider Balot 's criminal suspicion again ... There 's got to be another way to find out instead of winning big at a casino . Balot ? I 'm sorry . and all I could do was sleep . Could I get up on your shoulder ? I 'll make some coffee . Can I touch you ? Sure . Oeufcocque . I 'm fine . Let 's stay together until you fall asleep . Thank you . Good night . the art of mankind . We 've thrust a grave decision upon her . Huh ? We don 't know her latent feelings for revenge haven 't affected her . So she thirsts for revenge ? " Just what is ' Resolution " ' ? what do YOU think about her ? to overcome her fear of losing . THAT is what her case is about . but so that she may grow . is the job I 've wanted to do . What 's the problem ? you think of me as a tool and do not understand my feelings . I thought I 'd never again entrust my life to someone else . I 'm baffled she would voluntarily take the path to becoming a 09 Project supervisor . Do you know what " marriage blues " are ? What does that mean ? you talk about it over and over . It 's a means of resolution ? I look forward to when that time comes . It 's difficult . It 's a problem as old as humanity itself . Okay ? Yeah . We 're fully ready . We 're gonna win this case . How much should we win ? 000 dollars into 4 million . How much money is that ? but they 're just chips . getting the yolk . Don 't touch the shell or the white . Got it ? Yes . I think I can . this is our battlefield ! we 'll split up and get a sense of the atmosphere . like surfing . Don 't underestimate the security . an alert will be issued and you 'll be followed by every camera . That 's right . Grab the rhythm . Perfect . Wow ... we 're already being watched . Gotten the hang of things ? We can 't win with those machines ? None of the slot machines would let us win 2 million dollars . customers who win too much cause a stir . we take from those that won 't hurt the casino . right ? too ? I hacked the data the casino has on its customers . but they 're actually being fished in . From now own we 'll communicate with characters and wireless . Don 't misread them . Okay . I raise . Call . Fold . Call . Raise . Fold ! I call . Fold . I fold . Call . Showdown . Two pair . I win ! I think I could win with these . Fold . I fold . Why aren 't we competing ? They 've got a scheme . Cheating ? The one who 's winning ? That 's the mark . He 'll lose soon . the one on the left and the dealer are conspiring . The dealer ? The man on the right is the role of the player and has three aces . The Doctor has two pair with 5s and 4s . The mark has three jacks . And the old man next to him has two pair with 10s and 4s . How can you tell ? I read their smell and signs . Things like the placement of their chips and the way they arrange the cards are the signs . Can they manipulate the cards ? They 're marked cards . You can tell the card by the touch of your fingertip . That 's not fair . The player is going to win . Let 's do it . Watch carefully how everyone breathes . Right . Humans are never more defenseless than when they breathe in or out . Use that instant to call . I call . You 've got good luck with clubs . Raise right up to the limit . Raise . I raise . Call . but ... That 's a shame . We won . I win . What the ... A royal straight flush ... a whole lot of chips change hands . now . Things are going to get desperate . What should I do ? Wipe them out . Raise . Call . I win . Raise . I win . have the Doctor win . We win . aren 't they ? It was a nice game . magnificent . Here 's some winnings ! Go out and have a ball ! Yes ! sit anywhere . She 'll let us win . Start . She 's cool . her name is Bell Wing . She 's the preeminent spinner in the casino world . No more bets . 2 black . She aimed for it ? to draw in players . Let 's go . We 've got what we came for . Wait . I want to watch her . She 's not going to have you win again . I smell something fickle . I won 't use the chips I won . Please ? Don 't forget that we 're still far off from our target average . 15 black . That was close . 15 and 14 are on opposite sides . You 've been marked . You still want to do this ? so I want to beat her . I think I can . Is it okay ? I 'll back you up to the best of my ability . I 'm showing you data on roulette on the inside of your gloves . now . Right . and the softness of the cushion . Then do data analysis on those numbers . Figure out the average angle the ball will go until it drops . Calculate the angle between the ball and the tableau when they make contact . Read the movement of the ball ... Your opponent will purposefully try to break the average pattern . and predict the number she 's aiming for . I 'll try . You 're getting close to the target average . That 's what I was trying to do . Shouldn 't I ? go on and continue . is this your first time playing roulette ? Your eyes are shining . It 's like you enjoy the spinning of the ball . I think I 'm having fun because of you . Do you have something against this casino ? Why do you think that ? Your chips tell me that . We spinners can read what 's on the customers ' minds with just a few bets . I don 't have any intention of causing you trouble . What was the reason you chose my table ? Because I thought you were wonderful . 3 red . I have a duty as a spinner . And I have pride . I will stop you . Your first win was just business . You still don 't want to move to another table ? I 'll play here a little while longer . Even if I say I 'll save you ? A game is a game . I will learn from you . Learn ? I 'm not sure what . But I feel like I will learn . Fine then . don 't blame me . Counter-clockwise ? I can smell conviction . But I can 't tell what she 's convinced about . I know . She believes in the spinning of the ball . but ... 30 red . Wow . You could tell it would fall on the opposite side ? 17 black . She can tell exactly where I will bet . Yeah . Balot . Right . 0 red . The chips are like splinters . Have you figured out the tendencies of this table ? It 's a balanced table . luck 's gone unbalanced . To think the ball falls according to probability each time ... What 's the chance of that ? How difficult it is ... and not for anyone 's sake . And yet you refuse to stop defying luck . I 'm the kind of dealer that enjoys seeing their customers being crushed in defeat . it 's a devilish one . Why do you work here ? so that 's it . You have something against the boss here . I don 't care what company I work for . My husband was sick and I needed the money . I kept feeling I was spinning counter-clockwise . looking for a way to spin clockwise again . Counter-clockwise ? and clockwise to happiness . My life calls fate to spin counter-clockwise . It 's always been that way . And so it spins left again ... 1 red . Please spin it clockwise . I 'll win . What 's your name ? Rune-Balot . I am Bell Wing . any casino will do . Call yourself the disciple of Bell Wing . I 'll teach you all my techniques . Okay . I 'll spin it clockwise . Rune-Balot . Yes ? Don 't forget the effort needed to keep luck spinning clockwise . I won 't . It 's not something difficult . It 's the same as polishing yourself as a woman . As a woman ? Being in the right place . Being there at the right time . Wearing the right clothes . and having your hair done up correctly ... It 's all the same . Only the women who do that have luck spin clockwise . so be it . 2 black . I couldn 't see it . I think it was spinning clockwise . Go . That 's all for Bell Wing 's table . She lost repeatedly to you . and she was let go . She lost her job ? Because of me ? Yes ... But I could smell she didn 't care . She may have been used to this situation . you sure were the star . I 'm sorry . it 's okay . All according to plan . I think I might not be needed . What do you mean ? You have a right to fire us and hire some other people . too . I 'd be in real trouble ! How could you say that ? ! The Doctor feels responsibility for your amazing power . Responsibility ? he 'll have to freeze them . there 's no point to this all . I 'm soured all over ... Should we just quit now ? What is your goal ? like I said to Twee and the Professor . and ... And then you 'll destroy your opponent . It 'll be cruel ? Yes . It 's not good unless you know how cruel you are . Like how Bell Wing said she was devilish . I 'm not trying to put that kind of burden on her . But I think that 's the game Shell 's decided to play . too . Because I don 't have any other games to play . I want to use these chips and go as far as I can ! Oeufcocque . Balot 's decided to challenge her own worth . You should be a little more honest with yourself . From my experience . I 'd have it no other way . you 'll go non-stop . no matter what . 000 feet up ? Are you shitting me ? It 's a floating house for military use . But it 's on the surface now . Her dad 's making me play at the casino . I 'm defenseless here . I have to show him I can handle any situation . I 'll do it . I 'll need to know the key to your deal ... Stop it ! This is my deal ! and I 'll do it myself ! do your job ! Right now ! Got it ? I need RR . 6 hours is fine . Please . This drug will make you want to do your duty . 8 dead . 14 injured . That 's the number of comrades you blew away by accident . It 's the drug ... I can 't tell the difference between friend and foe ... Choose ! An operation to allow you to never sleep . Choose ! Have power dwell in your body ! Choose ! An experimental step ... Would you try talking ? C ... old ... W ... a ... rm ... Th ... ank you ... Wh ... o are y ... ou ? Dimsdale-Boiled . Do ... es it h ... urt ? Do ... es it h ... urt ? Nothing hurts . You no longer have need for rest ! You have forgotten how to sleep ! I feel nothing . Your mind and body are operating flawlessly ! I can feel nothing ! It 's already going extremely well . But he 's lost all range of emotion . as well . Oeufcocque ... then I will eliminate you . I will make it like you never were . Technique and strategy are the key to winning battles . Technique is choosing one 's opponents . Stay . Hit . Double down . Split . surrender ! Pay the line . Aces and 10s pay 1.5 . 10 times . In other words .. Blackjack ! I don 't know what trick you 've got but those are some nice gloves .

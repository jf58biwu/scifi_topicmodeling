Artie , is it- - is it possible that- - That yes , Virginia , there really is a Santa claus ? The dude enters and exits through chimneys ! He travels across the room as fairy dust . Look , Artie , this was the real Santa , okay ? Oh , and by the way , be nice , because Santa is bad-ass . There really was a Saint Nicholas in fourth century Turkey , and he was known to have put coins in people 's shoes . Real Santa ! Excellent ! You know , I knew it ! Seriously , it explains so much . You 're making a Christmas list in your head right now , aren 't you ? Maybe . He threatened Newley 's life . Well , the guy is a bit of a tool . Artie , is it possible that someone maybe has an artifact that lets them take the form of Santa ? Well , there are other Christmas legends , um , involving darker , imp-like spirits . Like , that was Krampus , and there 's also Black Peter . There are more . I 'll keep doing the research . - Artie , where 's Claudia ? - My own dark imp ? Yeah , I suspect she 's off plotting another holiday surprise . Too busy making money to keep a promise to your daughter ? Now is not a good time , Lila . You said that you were gonna decorate the tree ! I never said that , okay ? And listen , by the way , I sent over some incredibly expensive antique ornaments . Did you even bother to give them to her ? Not really the same as her dad being here . Look , I know my daughter , and I know that she happens to like things like that . She is an old soul .

I got a thought . Myks , why don 't you go interview the ex ? Big Lar and I will spend some q-time with the daughter , huh ? What do you say about that , huh ? Come on . - Well- - - Cancel your meetings . Here we go . All right . Here we go . I- - Come on , I hear Philadelphia is beautiful this time of year . So , as it turns out , calling 486 piano tuners , turns out it 's harder to split three ways when only one of you can pronounce glucky , uh ... Globben-killer ... - Gluckklavier . - Yes . Anyway , so we were about to ditch the whole plan when one of them says that this gluckenthing uses special tuning pins that are only made by this one company in Germany , so my kinda-German-speaking brother gets them on the horn , they narrow the list down to the couple of piano tuners in Philly who actually buy them , and here I am . I can 't imagine what 's so special about an old piano gathering dust in a corner . Is there hidden treasure inside ? Doubtful . But stranger things ... Let 's see . Ha ! Holy bah-humbug , Marley ! - It 's Marla . - Right . I 'm so sorry . Um , it 's--wow . This is just Artie 's- - it 's my boss ' initials . I can 't believe this is really it .

Artie 's dad deserves the truth . Yeah , I agree . He does . But Artie might be a little angry- - if I tell him everything ? - You mean there 's more ? - Oh , yes .

I think he ordered them from Germany or someplace . This picture of your ex-husband . Yeah , Larry used to dress up for the neighborhood kids as Santa . Kallie loved it . They both did . Myka , can I see that for a sec ? Sure . You know , these are old shell casings . Mm-hmm . Yeah , well , uh ... I might know what this is . Have you guys ever heard of the Christmas ceasefire ? You mean , during World War I ? Exactement ! All right , well , when I was in the Marine Corps , I had a drill instructor . He loved telling this story . [ Clears throat ] It was Christmas Eve , 1914 . I 'm not talking , like , L.A. Christmas . I 'm talking , like , Belgian Christmas . I 'm talking , like , icicles hanging off your nose and snow down your pants . And even though there was no formal truce , the German soldiers , they started lighting candles in the trenches and singing Christmas Carols . And then , in the distance , the British soldiers joined in . All of a sudden , these sworn enemies , who were only seconds before fighting one other , were meeting in no-man 's land between the trenches . Exchanging gifts , candy , souvenirs , and lots of improvised stuff . If there was ever a moment that could infuse an object and turn it into an artifact- - This would be one . So what do we do ? Goo it and see what happens ? Not without eyes on Newley . We wouldn 't know which one survived . Kallie , why this picture ? Well , I love that picture . Dad was so much fun when he was Santa . So I guess you were wishing for things to be like they were when your dad was Santa . - Mm , yeah , I guess . - It 's okay . I used to make a lot of wishes like that when I was your age too . That was the last Christmas we spent all together . Before you guys , you know ... It was the year before he opened his first mall and his business really took off . " What has more holiday spirit than a mall ? " That 's what he said . That 's where Santa Newley might consider home . We have to get to that mall . Okay , guys . Don 't worry .

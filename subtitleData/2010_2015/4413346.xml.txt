 All right . Let 's catch some dinner . I was kind of surprised that you suggested this trip . Well ... every man needs a hobby . When did you pick it up ? Well , when I got to Terra Nova , fish were the only thing I could hunt that didn 't hunt me back . This place must be full of fun memories . Actually ... sometimes I kind of miss those days . One time , I brought my son out here . Well , I strong-armed him into coming . That didn 't work out too good . It 's the first time I ever heard you talk about Lucas . So , how long has it been since he went missing ? That 's not my favorite topic . Come on . Oh ! Oh , yeah , I got something . - Set it ! - Like this ? There you go . What now ? Reel the bastard in . Come on ! Come on , baby ! Oh , yeah . - Come on . - Yeah , Mama ! Higher , Jim . Come on ! Whew ! Fun hobby . Yeah . Hey , guys . Hey . Don 't mind me . I 'm only home for a minute . I have seven re-entry work-ups to do this afternoon . You know , the team ... they 've been away in the wild for about , what , six months now ? That 's a long time . The leader is some guy named , um ... What is again now ? It 's , um , Ken Horton ? Ken Horton ? He 's back ? Who 's Ken Horton ? He 's a geologist . He 's like Marco Polo , Darwin and Shackleton all rolled in one . Hmm . Here ... Atlas of a Long Forgotten World by Ken Horton . Do you think he 'll sign it for me ? Well , let 's go find out . Come on . See ya ! Horton , welcome back . Marcus , so good to see you . It 's Malcolm . Malcolm . Of course . So sorry . This is Dr. Shannon . She 's gonna do your physicals and blood work-ups . Yeah , just to be safe . You never know what you might have been exposed to out there , after all that time . Then I place myself entirely in your capable hands , Doctor . Okay . Maddy ... Give them a hand unpacking the rover , would you ? There 's a good chap . They say a man 's nature is revealed by how he discharges his debts . Sounds like a fortune cookie , Boylan . Mm , and you 've made a deal with the Sixers . Mira 's calling in her favor . What 's she want ? Some kind of illness swept through the Sixer camp . They need medicine . Don 't they have you for that ? Not this time . What they need is tightly controlled . Azimeth , schedule II isomorph . It 's kept in a locked cabinet in the infirmary . You need an access card to get to it . I don 't have an access card . Mira 's asking me to rob my mother ? Mira 's the only one who can talk to the future . Do you want to get that girlfriend of yours to Terra Nova or not ? Well , you don 't seem any worse for the wear of six months OTG . So I can go ? Says here you had a stroke four years ago . Not long after I came through the portal , yes . Okay , well , I 'd like to do a cerebro-scan just , uh , get a better sense of how well you 're recovering . It 's been a long day . Can 't that wait ? I 'll tell you what ... I 'll make a deal with you . I 'll schedule it for next week if you say hello to my daughter . - This is Maddy . - Hi . She 's a huge fan . You don 't say . Well , I 've got to pop off to the lab . Perhaps you 'd like to come along . Yeah ! I can 't tell you what Atlas of a Long Forgotten World means to me . When I first found out that my mom was recruited to Terra Nova , I was terrified . You know , it seemed so far away , so alien . Then I-I read your book and ... well , after that , I couldn 't wait to come . Oh , you 're very sweet . Well , well , well , look at all this mess . It 'll take the balance of my life to sort through it . Well , if there 's anything I can do , I 'd be happy to help . In fact , I just finished a medical internship , so I was kind of looking for something new . But only if that works for you . I 'd be delighted . Really ? Really . You can 't do it , Josh . You know that . If I don 't , the deal 's off . Do you have any idea what Taylor would do to you if you got caught ? You 'd be lucky to get away with just being banished . Guess I better not get caught then . They 're Sixers . It 's not like I 'm giving them guns . They 're sick , they need the medicine . Oh , don 't make this out to be some kind of humanitarian gesture . I promised Kara I 'd get her here . Things in 2149 are getting worse every day . Mom will just have to do without some chems . She 'll cope . Glad to see you 've got your justifications all worked out . - That 's not fair . - You know what ? I 'm done . How do you even know that Mira and Boylan can do any of the things they promised ? You could be walking into a world of hurt for nothing . Most of these specimens come from the same valley . We found over 30 entirely new species . Things we never even knew existed . They 're beautiful . Mm , but first things first . Tomorrow we have to catalogue all the rock samples according to where they were found . So , bring a light snack and your love of dull tasks . And remember , don 't take schist for granite . That 's very clever . You wrote that in your first chapter of Geomorphisis . Right . Of course . Ah , the old memory 's not as sharp as it used to be . Oh , I almost forgot . Would you mind signing my copy of Atlas ? Oh , I 'd be happy to . And also , I 've been dying to know , did you ever get a chance to radioisotope the coastal outcroppings ? No . Continental drift never interested me much . Really ? 'Cause in your letter , you said that you couldn 't wait to go to Terra Nova to investigate it . I wrote you ? Yeah . Years ago . I ... I wrote you a fan letter first , obviously . Oh , is it on here ? Your reply ? No . I used this stationary set I got for Christmas , and in your response , you said , it was quaint to get a real letter , you had to answer in kind . It 's okay if you don 't remember . I mean , I 'm sure you get tons of dorky kids writing you , so ... Do you still have it ? Yeah , it 's one of my most prized possessions . I wouldn 't have dreamt of leaving it behind . Can I borrow it ? I 'd ... I 'd love to make a copy for my archives . Really ? I 'm sure you 've written to tons more interesting people . But none as charming . Sure . I 'll bring it in . Perfect . See you tomorrow , then ? Yes . You owe me 500 terras , and this is what you bring me as payment ? It 's not only broken . It 's worthless . Look , I can come up with the money . I just need more time . Three days , and that 's it . Thank you . Boylan ? The Eleventh Pilgrimage is next month , and I want proof that Kara 's really coming . How am I supposed to get proof ? We 're cut off from 2149 , remember ? Look , Mira 's the only one with a line to the future , and she 's given me every assurance that Kara ... Well , if she wants those meds , I want more than assurances . I will read you a bedtime story . But you don 't do the voices right . I want Daddy to read my bedtime story . Well , bad luck , kid . You 're stuck with me . Daddy 's gone fishing . Now go on , wash up . Go on . - Hey . - Hey . I hear you have a new internship . Yeah . Well , I thought you 'd be thrilled . What 's wrong ? No , it 's stupid . What ? If you can 't tell your old mum something stupid , who can you tell ? It 's just ... Horton forgot this joke from his first book , and then , he , like , totally contradicted something he told me in his letter . Like , right here , he says ... Wait ... the signatures don 't match . Zoe , why is the water still running ? You better not be making swamps for dinosaurs in there . Mom , the signatures don 't match . Oh , honey , he had a stroke . - I mean , he 's not the man he was . - I know , but ... Heroes rarely live up to our expectations of them . Maybe ... I don 't know . Maybe you just need to think about all the things that made you look up to him in the first place , okay ? I need to go and scold Zoe . Zoe ! This one 's all you , kid . We agreed you 'd do as I said , no questions asked , and now you demand proof ? You 're asking a lot . It 's my mom . You 're asking me to steal from my mother . Kara ? Oh ... Oh , my God , Josh , it 's really you . I 've missed you . Does this mean it 's true , what they 're telling me about being on the next Pilgrimage ? I promised you I 'd get you here . You kept your promise . What happened ? Get her back . You 'll have plenty of time to talk once Boylan gets her here . Proof enough ? You 'll get your meds . Well , how big would you say the fish I caught was ? Well , I 'd say that fish was as big as you want it to be . Well , I think we should say eight feet . What ? Fire 's gone cold . Couple days old at least . Sixers ? They would never be this careless . Terra Nova , standard issue . Curran . - Curran ? - Got to be . Who else would be living out here on their own ? Well , if he left it behind , it must have been in a hurry . I tell you what ... why don 't you head in ? Tell Washington I 'll be out for another day or so . Wait , don 't tell me you 're having a change of heart about banishing Curran ? He murdered a fellow soldier . What do you think ? So , you 're , what , you 're going to kill him ? Outpost five is just a couple of clicks north of here . I 'll pick up a rover there . I 'll see you back at the colony . It 's a damn shame what the mold did to these beautiful trees . As you can see , every apple in Terra Nova ... is inedible . Yeah , that 's too bad . My little sister Zoe has always dreamt of trying apple pie . By the way , did you have a chance to look for that letter ? Yeah , I brought it with me . It 's right here . Thank you . Remember that expedition you were on when you wrote me with , um , gosh , what was his name ? I 'm afraid I don 't recall . Well , it was a pretty big deal , you know , someone you 'd worked with before . Come on , you must remember . I don 't . Details become so jumbled . When you 're my age , you 'll understand . Right . Sorry . What 's this ? A few hundred miles north , I found a species of beetle . They feed on the apple blight mold . Hmm . Well , go ahead , open it . Go on . In a few weeks , Zoe can have her pie . At first I just thought he was embarrassed because he didn 't remember , and then he got ... I don 't know , mad almost . Maybe Mom 's right ... maybe I just expected too much . Maybe he wants your blood . What ? Well , my friend Nina said a vampire came through on the last Pilgrimage . Your friend Nina is just trying to scare you . Well , maybe one will come on the 11th . We can hope . Oh , hey , I got xiph kebabs for dinner tonight . I 'm late for work , I 'm gonna eat at the bar . Okay , well , don 't work too late . Something wrong ? No , everything 's fine . Okay , see you . Copied the access code . But you stripped the identification info , right , like , it won 't trace back to her ? No one is going to know it 's your mum 's badge . What 's that for ? In case someone walks in on you . One shot with this on the lowest setting , they won 't even remember their own name . Damn it , Boylan . Curran , wake up . I said wake up . Now , that is one nasty-looking leg wound . Stinks , too . Couldn 't have happened to a nicer guy . And you just left him out there ? I wasn 't about to wrestle him into the rover , Wash . What do you think he 's going to do to Curran if he finds him ? I don 't know ... but I wouldn 't want to be in his shoes right now . Anyway , it 's a good thing you 're back . We had a break-in in the infirmary last night . Broke in through the window . Knew exactly which room to target . And exactly what they were after . They 've taken every vial of Azimeth . Yeah , makes sense . It 's got a high street value . Well , yeah , in Chicago , but here we barely have streets . I mean , you think there 's Azimeth junkies in Terra Nova ? I 'll tell you one thing ... you gotta be high , drunk , or desperate to use a sonic pistol indoors in such close quarters . Whoever did this is hurting this morning . Hey , where 's Horton ? Just running some tests . Can I help you ? His preliminary report should have been filed yesterday . How am I supposed to allocate lab resources when he ... ? I want to talk to you about your report . What was that ? The summary of your findings ? Sorry , I can 't hear you . The summary of your ... ! Really ? Have your report on my desk by Monday or I 'll cut your funding . How 's that for funny ? Oh , I gotta go . I have to drop Zoe off at school . - 9 : 00 tomorrow ? - Yeah . Uh , by the way , can I get my letter ? Certainly . Of course . Um ... let 's see , I scanned it and then I put it , uh ... somewhere . Look , I 'm sure it 'll turn up . Yeah , that 's okay . I 'll just get it another time . Why would he pretend to lose my letter ? The only thing I can think of is that he knew that the signatures didn 't match , but ... so what ? He supposedly had a stroke , right ? Maybe you should trick him into eating garlic . What ? It burns them . Zoe , he 's still not a vampire . I think he is . I have to get that letter back . So , what now , are you going to kill me ? You seem to be doing a pretty good job of that yourself . Drink this , it 'll help the infection . You 've been hit by an ancestral Komodo . I was trying to set a snare . It was on me before I even saw it . Took one bite and left . No , it didn 't leave . It 's tracking you . Komodos are cowards . They hang back till they 're confident that their prey is incapacitated . They 've got bacteria that lives in special ducts under their tongues . One bite and you 're infected . When you 're too weak to fight back , Komodo moves in , finishes the job . Why are you helping ? You 're the one who exiled me for murder . Lay back , gather your strength . Let me worry about the Komodo . No , I don 't understand how anyone could justify stealing from a hospital . You know , when you 're looking to get high , you don 't care about anything else . Look at that kid , your buddy who got a parasite from drinking Taroca root . Hunter had nothing to do with this , Dad . I didn 't say that he did . Well , I just hope you can recover some of the missing chems . I have a patient with a rare neurological disorder , and the only thing that 's going to help is a small dose of Azimeth . She 'll die without that treatment . Can 't you order more ? I have to wait till the 11th Pilgrimage just to requisition it . That 's just stupid . Has anyone ever thought that the thing this place needs most is a way to communicate with 2149 ? What 's wrong with him ? You know what I think ? I think the stroke 's just a way of him explaining his mistakes . He 's not , he 's not the real Ken Horton . No , he stole his identity to come to Terra Nova in his place . Probably paid some Facer a fortune to help him . What 's a Facer ? They 're ... doctors that make you look like someone else . That 's how he got rid of his fangs . Do you talk like that in school ? 'Cause you sound crazy . But then again , look at me . Facers , stolen identities ... And I don 't even have any proof . I mean , he burnt the letter . But I kept the envelope . And the real Horton licked it , so it has his DNA . So all I have to do is get a sample of the fake Horton 's DNA and compare it , right ? Now , all these specimens have to be catalogued in the database according to their phyla . Phyla ... got it . Oh , it was Dr. Grazier , by the way . The colleague I was working with back in 2144 . You asked about him yesterday . Oh , right , yeah . Was there a question about our expedition ? Uh , yeah . I don 't remember what it was , sorry . Oh , well , it 'll come back to you just like it did to me . I 'd better go get started , then . Yeah . What are you doing ? Whoa , you need authorization to use the DNA sampler . Oh , sorry , I didn 't realize . Whose DNA are you comparing ? If you don 't have the subject 's permission , this is a very serious violation of privacy . I know , I know , I 'm sorry . I just , I just think that maybe Horton isn 't who he says he is , and I promise , I think I can prove it . If you just give me ten more minutes , I ... Come again ? You think Horton 's a fraud ? Yeah . Watch out , watch out . It 'll go faster if I help . Josh ? Yeah . I 'm meeting Mira tonight . Once they get their meds , they 're going to let me contact my people in 2149 , and it 's official ... Kara 's on the 11th . That 's great . Thank you ... for everything . My dad 's asking a lot of questions . I don 't think he 's gonna stop until he figures out the whole truth . Well , the truth would be very bad for business . Why don 't you cut out early tonight ? Go and hang out with the family , you know , play the dutiful son , and I promise , by tomorrow , no one will suspect you . Okay . Hey , Willy ... how 'd you like to work off that money you owe me ? Oh , it 's a match . No , not possible . No , I 'm afraid there 's no question . Dr. Horton is who he says he is . I was so sure . I 'm sorry I wasted your time . No , no problem . I guess I 'll just have to keep putting up with his casual insolence and being treated like his research assistant . Thanks for helping me out . No , no , not at all . Better delete those files , eh ? Yeah . You wanted to see me ? Yeah , my patient here stumbled in , complaining he cracked a rib . Claims he fell down some stairs . On the same night as the break-in . - What an amazing coincidence . - My thoughts exactly , so I ran him through the iso-scanner and his tissue exhibits damage consistent with a sonic blast . Must hurt like hell . Not at the moment ... luckily for him , he 's high on Azimeth . Nice work . Think I 'll take a look around his place . Yeah , let me know as soon as you find those chems . My patient 's due another treatment in a few days . Get outta here you bastard ! Beat it . Get outta here you coward ! Good , you 're awake . The Komodo ? Like I told you , Komodos are cowards . You 've just got to face a coward down . You never answered me . Why save a murderer ? I like a good redemption story . You play your cards right , I might even let you back inside the gates . What do you expect in return ? You travel to the coordinates I marked on your map . The Sixer camp is somewhere in that area , up in the trees . You won 't have to try to find them . You just stumble around , they 'll find you . Yeah , and when I do , they 'll kill me . I don 't think so . You murdered a Terra Novan . They might even bake you a cake . You tell ' em you 're seeking asylum , you make friends , ingratiate yourself . You 're gonna find out for me who inside Terra Nova is supplying information to Mira . If she 's got a spy , she 's gonna keep that secret pretty close . You do it , Curran ... or the next time I track you down , the last thing you 're going to see alive will be my face . What Malcolm said got me thinking . Horton was an important guy . Tons of research projects . He must have had some sort of assistant , you know , someone to handle his correspondence . Maybe Horton did actually write the letter , but his assistant was the one that mailed it , and that 's why the DNA matches but the signatures don 't . What if he stole his boss 's identity to get to Terra Nova ? So are they both vampires ? Sometimes you worry me . Go on , I 'll pick you up after school . Who was Ken Horton 's research assistant ? Andrew Fickett . Same height , age , build . Whereabouts unknown . Any mention of him stops right before Horton 's Pilgrimage . Bring up all the crimes in Cambridge for the preceding six months . Here . " Unidentified male found in park ... " " Eyes and hands mutilated , identification impossible . " Oh , my God . He didn 't just steal his identity . He killed him . Reading material like that 's liable to give you nightmares . I should go . My mom 's expecting me . Your mother 's in surgery . No one 's expecting you . I 'm sorry . I thought I had the reservation for 2 : 00 . Uh , that 's okay . I was just leaving . We searched his house , and found only one empty bottle . Where 's the rest of the Azimeth ? I used it . You 'd be in a coma . Okay . I sold it . To who ? I don 't remember . You going to arrest me or what ? That 's what you want , isn 't it ? Question is ... Why ? Hey ! You covering for somebody ? Ow ! Are you you ? Who is it ? It was Boylan . It was Boylan ! Yeah . Should have known . Keep an eye on this joker . Sorry I 'm late , Mrs. Reed . Is Zoe ready ? I really have to go . Dr. Horton picked her up a few minutes ago . Dr. Horton ? You let her leave with him ? I 'm sorry . He said you knew . Oh , my God . Where 'd they go ? They went that way . The orchards . When will there be pie ? Soon . Just have to wait for a few more of these to ripen . Get away from her . Leave now , or I 'll tell everyone ... What ? Tell everyone I saved the apple harvest ? Why don 't you find something more interesting for your little sister to do while we have a chat ? Zoe , run and find Dad , okay ? Tell him I 'll be home in plenty of time to make the asparagus . Nicely done . Daddy ! Daddy ! Hey , Z. Daddy 's got to go catch a bad guy , okay ? - But ... - Wait . Shouldn 't Maddy be watching you ? She said to tell you something very important . If anything happens to me , my dad will ... Oh , he 'll suspect , all right , but without proof , he 'll ... Can 't let you go . Sorry . Andrew , right ? I know what it 's like to be the one in the background , overshadowed . In my old school , everybody was happy to cheat off my homework , but no one even knew my name . It 's not fair . You did all that work , all those years , and Horton was recruited . Killing him was wrong , but you 've more than made up for it . You deserve a second chance . I mean , isn 't that what this place is about ? Promise I won 't tell anyone what I know . Ha ! You 're never gonna let this go . He was your hero . Funny thing is , you would have hated him . He lied to everyone , stole research . I wanted to save you from all that . I wanted to be the perfect Dr. Kenneth Horton , but you ... had to keep that letter . The spider 's bite is painless . Please ... Your family will just think you fell asleep and got stung . Ah ... You okay ? You all right ? Okay . It 's all right . It 's okay . When I think about what almost happened out there ... Thank God for your panic words . Asparagus ? I always thought you were being paranoid . But I guess I was wrong . Hey . You feeling better , sweetie ? Yeah , a little . Maddy , what on earth possessed you to try and deal with all of this on your own ? I didn 't have any proof . And I did try and talk to you , Mom . Yes , you 're right . You did . But if I 'm not listening to you , then you have to make me listen , okay ? Or you go and get your father . Yeah . That being said , you trusted you gut , even when all the evidence was against you . Proud of you . I just keep thinking of Dr. Horton . You know , how he was just killed before he could even come here and live out his dream . Do you think the things that Fickett said about him were true ? All I know is that the real Horton took the time to write to a young girl who loved his work . That 's right . What 's going on ? Go check on Zoe . What are you doing with this ? It 's for your patient . I swear , I didn 't know . I didn 't think anyone would get hurt . You broke into a clinic . You stole from your mother . You didn 't think anyone would get hurt ? I 'm sorry . I don 't understand . Did you use it ? Did you sell it ? - I gave it all to the Sixers ... - The Sixers ? ! Why , Josh ? They promised me they 'd get Kara here . Who ? Who said the Sixers could do that ? I hate violence . It 's never the answer . You got my son caught up with the Sixers . He could 've been killed . Look , the kid came to me with a problem . I was just ... Yeah , and you gave him false hope . The Sixers don 't have the technology to get his girlfriend here . They can barely feed themselves . I might be a lot of things , Shannon , but I am no liar . Now I don 't know how she does it , but ... Mira can talk to the future . No , no , that 's not possible . The portal has to be open to talk to 2149 . Well , apparently , the Sixers have figured out a way around that . Lucas . Your son ? What about him ? The kid 's a genius . The whole reason they recruited him was ... was so he could try to figure out some way to communicate with Hope Plaza between pilgrimages . You think the Sixers captured him and forced him to work for them ? Look , if you 're right , then at least there 's a chance he 's still alive . There might even be a chance of getting him out of there and bringing him back home . No , Shannon . There 's no chance of that . No chance at all . How do you know that ? How are things between you and Josh ? They 've been better . Fathers and sons . Let me put it this way . Maybe you should be grateful that the worst you have to worry about is your boy getting in over his head because of a girl .

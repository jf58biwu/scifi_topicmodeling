 Julia : Previously on helix ... He 's crashing ! That 's his ex-wife ? He never talks about her or his brother . That 's probably because he caught her and his brother in bed together . Julia : I did this . I 've been here before . You tested negative . Are you really sure ? I can 't keep you here . You 're sick . I 'm not the only one . How long have you known about your tumor ? Doreen : The people who designed this virus want to change us , From the inside out . Ah ! ( wind blowing ) ( footsteps approaching ) ( device chimes ) Who the hell is dr . Hvit ? ( screeching ) ( loud screeching ) Duchamp : Dr. Farragut , you wanted to see me ? Alan : Yeah , I want to show you something . Is it peter ? No . His status is unchanged . Still no brain activity . Have a look at this . I used your protocols and a modified compound I 've been experimenting with . I substituted multiple residues At these two binding sites , added a tetrahydrofuran carbamate here , A triazine ring here , all to reduce stearic interaction . And that 's taking the virus longer to break the sodras down . But it still does in the end . I 've taken this as far as I can in culture . I need to see how it reacts in living tissue . I can start animal studies to test efficacy and safety right away . We could have results in 24 hours ... I 'd like to bring my veterinary pathologist , Doreen boyle , up to speed on this . I think she could be a big help . Alan , this is progress . It has to work in the rats first . And if it does ? If it does , hatake won 't have any more excuses . We 'll reopen level r , Start testing julia and the rest of the infected patients . Dr. Farragut . I asked you to check in on the hour . Uninterrupted research is how we get results . If hatake has a problem with that , He can talk to me himself for whatever that 's worth . He 's left me in charge while he takes care ... While he conducts " base business . " right . ( dr . Van eigem groaning in pain ) ( dr . Van eigem groaning loudly ) Shh , shh , shh . Shh . Someone might hear you . It hurts . I know , but you have to stay quiet . If they find you , they 'll take you back to level r . I have to get back to my lab work . I 'll try and get back as soon as I can with more morphine . ( groaning in pain ) Warm , gooey chocolate brownies . A study at the university of wisconsin showed that Fantasizing about delicious food can help minimize pain . Brownies are my go-to . Cupcakes . That 's good . What kind ? The more specific , the better . Uh ... Red velvet , cream cheese icing . And none of that flaky cake . I like it dense . Did it help ? A little ... But now I 'm hungry . ( laughs ) ( groans ) The worst part is the waiting . Death should come out of nowhere . You shouldn 't have to stare it in the face . How do you do it , Knowing you 're just waiting to die ? We 're all waiting to die , I just have a little less time . What the hell are you doing ? It 's comfy . Get out of his chair . Sure . Where 's dr . Hvit ? Who ? Dr. Hvit . I need to speak to him or her right away . There 's no one on this base by the name of dr . Hvit . Now get out of his chair . He 's got you well trained . Excuse me ? How much is he paying you to inspire such loyalty ? I don 't work for him . That 's right . He adopted you . You 're like a son to him . I am his son . You know , in the favelas in rio , The gangs , they call themselves a familia . Family . And they have a saying , " blood in , blood out . " They 'd find these little boys , nine , 10 years old , And they 'd make them murder people To bond them to the gang , blood in . And these boys , they 'd go so deep , they 'd have no idea That they were grunts , that they were expendable . And if they disobeyed , Or tried to leave the gang Blood out . Hatake 's down on level r , doing god knows what . You think he left you in charge because he trusts you , Or because he 's trying to distract you ? You need to get out of this office . Now . ( yelling in pain ) ( theme music playing ) ( pounding on door ) please . We have food . There 's plenty here . We can all share . ( coughing ) man : Are you sick ? Get the hell away from here ! This is a waste of time . We should get out . We have to organize the people down here . It 's a better chance of survival . Can we talk about the reason you don 't want to go back ? What 's that ? The initials on the wall , your initials . They weren 't my initials . I 've never been here before . So how do you explain that it was your handwriting ? Hallucinations are one of the symptoms of the infection . Nice try , but I saw them too . Is it possible you were here when you were younger ? Yeah , I must have forgotten All those family vacations to the arctic circle . ( sighs ) I grew up in montana . The most exotic place I ever went as a kid was bozeman . Jules . What did you just call me ? If you don 't like it , I won 't call you that . No , it 's just , uh ... Alan and my mother were the only ones who ever called me that . ( metallic clanking ) ( hatake groaning ) Help ... Please . ( beeps ) ( door opening ) Doreen ! Jesus . Hold on . Oh , my god . What happened ? Was ... Was she attacked by a vector ? It was the rats . The rats ? How did they get out ? The cages were turned over on her . Maybe she had some kind of heart attack , Grabbed the rack , and it went down when she did . Or someone pushed it . You think someone did this on purpose ? We have annual physicals for field duty . If doreen had any hint of cardiac distress , She 'd never have been permitted to join this investigation . Altitude changes effect individuals differently . And the co2 scrubbers were turned off for four hours yesterday . Seems like she was in pretty good health to me . Do you know how many murders have occurred at this base , dr . Farragut ? Zero . Accidents , however , happen all the time ... This wasn 't a goddamn accident ! Until the evidence suggests otherwise ... Evidence ? We 're in the ass-end of nowhere , cut off from the world . My best doctor is trapped and dying somewhere below us , And my closest friend from the cdc has very likely just been murdered . This place is a ... It 's a time bomb waiting to go off , And we 're pretending this , these goddamn things , are gonna save us ! Right now , I 'm thinking the virus is not our biggest problem . I 'll review the surveillance footage immediately . No . Not alone you won 't . Sarah , find dr . Duchamp . Tell him to start the animal trials with the sodra immediately . You find me if there are complications . I said we would bring food and water If they turned the oxygen scrubbers back on , But they attacked me . The bleeding is slowing , but you 're gonna need stitches . We need to get you to that lab we set up for triage . That 's on the other side of the facility . We can 't drag him all the way over there . Why not ? What was that ? Dr. Hatake , this is jaye . Jaye , hatake . Jaye ? Don 't pretend like you don 't know who I am . And I won 't pretend I 'm gonna help you After you locked us down here to fend for ourselves . You did seal us up down here . I had no choice . We could not allow the infection to spread . We need to get you to that lab , close up this wound . It 's too dangerous . We 'd never make it . Is there any other way across this level ? An access tunnel . It goes all the way to the other side of the base . But I would not ask you to ... Risk your life for mine . You don 't have to ask . You need my help , I 'm gonna help you . Let 's narrow the window of incident . When was the last time you saw dr . Boyle ? About 9 : 00 a.M. Yesterday morning . In 10 hours , you didn 't check in with her ? Alan : I was running sodra trials on my brother . And she was capable , she didn 't need to check in . Right . " uninterrupted research . " What happened there ? The file 's been corrupted . I 'll check the backup . Uh-huh . That 's impossible . The backups have been deleted too . The only ones with access are me and ... Hatake , who 's conveniently disappeared . Neither of us have anything to do with this . I will find out what happened to dr . Boyle . I 'll find out myself , Through an autopsy . Dr. Duchamp ? I 'm major balleseros . Is this another check-in ? I 'm showing no signs of infection . No . I 'm looking for a dr . Hvit . That 's a name I haven 't heard in a while . I was going through the research files , And I saw that you two did a paper together . That was many years ago . So he 's no longer on the base ? Oh , no , he is . It 's just , no one ever sees him anymore . I hear he developed a rare immune deficiency . He can no longer interact with people . He 's become somewhat of an urban legend . I heard rumors he 's in the white room . Where can I find that ? We are all in the white room . Excuse me . I need to speak with the major . Did you kill the cdc vet ? Hmm . You 'd think I 'd remember that . Ugh ! Did you do it ? What did the surveillance video show ? Did hatake know ? Ask him . He tells you everything , right ? Dr. Farragut is running an autopsy as we speak . You better hope you covered your tracks . Automated voice : Code 852 , level d , hematology . Attention . Code 852 , level d , hematology . Attention . Code 852 , level d , hematology . Dr. Van eigem ? Shit . Dr. Van eigem , what are you doing ? I 'm dancing for tony . Tony isn 't here . Of course he is . ( groaning in pain ) What 's wrong ? ( growling ) What happened ? I couldn 't stop myself . I 'm gonna turn into one of those things , aren 't I ? We need to get you back to the room . Come on . Julia : How long is it ? Forty meters . I vote we go around . Who knows what 's waiting for us in there ? We don 't have time . All right , let 's go . ( grunting with effort ) ( glass crunching ) What are we stepping on ? Julia : Looks like glass . Someone busted the lights out . Probably trying to hide . Or ... Setting a trap . Found anything ? She died of an embolism . A scan revealed bruising in the left hemisphere of her brain , Consistent with an air bubble . So it was natural causes . Why would anyone have erased the security footage ? Did you see doreen yesterday ? Just in passing . Did she say anything ? About her research ? Any breakthrough she might 've had ? No , she didn 't . I didn 't know doreen too well , but she seemed like a good person to have on your team . I knew her 15 years . She didn 't deserve this . Did she have any family ? A son from her third marriage . Hand me that bottle of alcohol . What is that ? Puncture mark ... From a needle . I don 't want to become one of those things . I know . Don 't let me . You know what I 'm asking . You 're sick . It 's the drugs talking . I was on my way to the drug stockroom Before ... I saw tony . I can 't do it myself . Please . Please . ( breathing shakily ) ( pounding on door ) alan : Sarah ? Sarah , it 's alan . ( groaning ) Alan : You all right in there ? One minute . Hey . Sorry , I was just getting changed . What 's going on ? Doreen was murdered . The autopsy proves it . How ? Somebody used a syringe To make it look like she had an embolism . They knew what they were doing . We need to be careful . Are you okay ? Yeah . I 'm ... I , uh ... ( breathing heavily ) I ... I just don 't know what 's going on here . I mean ... Walker 's sick , doreen 's dead , You 're telling me that somebody murdered her . I ... Are we even gonna make it out of this place alive ? Shh , shh , shh , shh . It 's okay . It 's okay . I won 't let anything happen to you . All right ? Sarah , I ... I 'm sorry . I ... I shouldn 't have done that . Are you high ? What ? I can barely see your pupils . What are you on ? I had a migraine , so I took something . What ? Gabapentin . You 're lying , unless you took the whole bottle . Alan , wait . I ... I can expl ... No , there 's no excuse for this , ever ! People 's lives are at stake , they 're depending on us ! You 're of no use to me like this ! But I ... No , you go sleep this off . We 'll deal with it later . I 'm sorry ... Can we take a moment ? No , not really . ( groaning ) Let me take a look at your wound . Oh . We need to tie something around you for more pressure . Here , use this . And hurry up . Okay , I 'm gonna need you to lean forward for me . ( distant slamming ) What was that ? Oh , my god . Rats ! Where are they coming from ? Hatake : The more important question is , What are they running from ? ( gasps ) ( vector snarling ) run ! ( jaye screaming ) The door ! Get to the door ! Where 's jaye ? She was right behind me . I didn 't see her . We have to go back ! It 's too late . ( vector growling ) ( pounding on door ) What exactly are we looking for ? Anything salvageable of doreen 's research . Any clue as to what she might have discovered Before she ... ( sighs ) You think there 's some kind of cover-up ? Why else would anyone kill her ? The transgenics lab . What about it ? That lab where they found the monkey , It was totally cleaned out before she had a chance to gather any samples . She didn 't tell you ? No , she didn 't . Sanitized from top to bottom . Figured hatake must have ordered it . If it was cleaned out , where 'd she get the monkey sample she was analyzing ? Maybe some of the scientists from here were helping her . Come to think of it , she did mention a name ... Dr ... Hvit ? She never mentioned him to me . That 's strange . She said she spoke to him . Said he seemed to have all the answers . Well , I will find this dr . Hvit and ... See if he can shed any light on the situation . I don 't know a dr . Hvit . Doreen talked to him . She talked to him ? Doreen told you that ? No , major balleseros did . Major balleseros also told me How they found the transgenics lab cleaned out . But I guess you know nothing about that either . That was a routine sanitization procedure . Bullshit , that was a cover-up . Why would we want to cover up a virus That we need you to cure ? You 're so focused on seeing us as the bad guys , You don 't see what 's right in front of you . How well do you know major balleseros ? I met him five days ago . Same day you met me . And you trust him ? Why ? Because he 's wearing a uniform ? Julia : How did you get those scars on your back ? Hatake : There was a fire , years ago , At my home in kyoto . The entire house was in flames when I arrived . My daughter Was still inside . I tried to save her . What was she like ? Your daughter . She was smart . Curious about the world . You ... You remind me of her . I haven 't heard anything outside for a while . We should try and get to the triage lab . What made you change your mind ? I know what it 's like to be in pain . The kind of pain that you ... You would do anything to make it stop . And I 've never considered ending it , but Don 't we all wish that we could control when we go And how we go ? Are you sure ? Are you really sure ? Yes . ( sniffles ) ( crying ) Thank you . Got something . This is semtex . Plastic explosive . Balleseros sabotaged the satellite . Because he didn 't need it to call out . He 's been sending messages to someone since we got here . Doreen 's research is on here too . He killed her . Here 's the last transmission . ( reading ) ( door opening and closing ) What is the damn white room ? Automated voice : Attention . Code 517 , level e , virology lab . Duchamp . Where is the white room ? We are all in the white room . It 's an inside joke among the base scientists . We 're in the arctic , it 's all the white room . They 're outside . Balleseros : I see you got my message . Ugh ! Thanks . I would have never found hvit without you . Dr. Hatake , stay with me now . We 're almost there . Please ... Call me hiroshi . ( panting ) Come on . ( vector growling ) ( shrieking ) Took you guys long enough . Nobody goes outside in a whiteout . You won 't even be able to see more than two feet in any direction . There are guide ropes to follow , right ? It 's not that simple . You 've never experienced anything like this . Minus 60 , and the wind chill doubles that . Fine , if you 're doing this , you stay on the guidelines Around the building until you get to the line going out . Do not unclip until you get there , Or else you 'll just ... Disappear . Jaye : I managed to get tracey off of me , and then I ran . It was too dark for her to see me , I guess . I ducked into the first lab I could find , And then I came here . I thought for sure you were dead . That makes two of us . Jaye , I ... Don 't beat yourself up for closing that door . You thought I was right behind you . Looks like we make a pretty good team . We do , don 't we ? ( groaning ) Jaye : Good . He 's waking up . Maybe he can tell us more lies about his daughter . How did you ... You weren 't there . Hatake : You remind me of her . I wasn 't where ? You weren 't there when hatake told that story . They weren 't my initials . I 've never been here before . So how do you explain that it was your handwriting ? Hallucinations are one of the symptoms of the infection . No . That 's not possible . I watched you do things . Julia : We need to tie something around you for more pressure . Jaye : Here , use this . Hurry up . Jaye : It was you , jules . It was all you . All those times you saved me . ( julia screams ) ( echoing ) you saved yourself . Hey ! Coming through ! Switch clamps ! You killed her , you bastard ! You have no idea what 's going on here ! Doreen was collateral damage . Ugh ! Ugh ! Nice knowing you , doc . Ugh ! Alan : Did balleseros come back through here ? Duchamp : I haven 't seen him . He attacked me on the ice . We need to get a security team together and go after him . You don 't need to do anything . You should have never been on that ice in the first place . He killed doreen . Well , it looks like he almost killed you too . Daniel : I 've got a reply for that message ! ( grunting ) Ah ! Ah ! ( screams ) ( gasps in pain ) Ah ... Hold still . Automated voice : Cleanup requested . Pantry , level c . Cleanup requested . Pantry , level c . You know why I picked you for my team , sarah ? Because I was the best candidate . Because you were driven . I remember the first day you walked into my office , and ... I thought to myself , " that girl , even when she sleeps , " she tries to do it better than anyone else . " ( chuckles ) Nothing distracts us from the work . But that 's the problem with laser focus , With our particular way of looking at the world . We only see the thing in front of us , the thing Under the microscope , And we miss what 's happening all around . That 's why my marriage fell apart . That 's why my brother Was up here in this ... Place . I can 't keep making the same mistakes . I 'm sorry I didn 't listen to you before , but ... I 'm listening now . I get these migraines . I 've had them since college , and when they come on , I ... I can 't think , I can 't ... Work , I can 't do anything . I took some morphine from the drug stockroom . I thought if I just had a little bit to even me out , I 'd be able to go back to work . I 'm sorry . I 've never done anything like this , I swear . It 's okay . We 've all lost ourselves A little bit here . ( respirator pumping ) My team has fallen apart . Again . I lost you and jules last time . Now I 've lost doreen . I don 't know what to do . You were always good at that part . Even with mom , On her worst days , you had hope . I need a little of your hope . Right now , peter . ( device beeping )

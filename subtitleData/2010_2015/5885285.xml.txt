 Previously on " the 100 " ... Where 's clarke ? Clarke 's not here . The grounders took them . You didn 't send that search team out , did you ? I 'm going after them . Bring them home . Welcome to mount weather . This place is too good to be true . You sound like a crazy person . We 're guests here , not prisoners . Clarke , no ! You pull that lever , these people will die . Even a little radiation could kill them . Your dna ran the same gauntlet As the grounders . Your ability to metabolize that radiation Is even stronger . Anya ? I 'm gonna get you out of here . [ whispering ] come on . Oh , damn it . [ clank ] Ok . Come on . Quick . Get back in . [ grounders groaning ] Clarke : Hey . No . Ok . We 've gotta go . Now . [ door creaks ] [ alarm blaring ] What is that ? I don 't know . Both : Aah ! Ahh . What ? Oh , my god . Oh , my god . Anya ! Take my hand . We 're out . Hey . Come on . Get dressed . We can 't cover any ground like this . I won 't leave my people behind . Anya , now , listen to me . My people are still inside that place , too , But they have guards . They have weapons . Once we get out of here , We can find help . We can come back . There is no " we . " [ man speaking indistinctly ] Someone 's coming . [ men speaking indistinctly ] Not just someone reapers . [ men speaking indistinctly ] Hey . Anya , you can 't fight . You can hardly stand . I got a better idea . Come on . [ man speaks indistinctly ] [ man speaks indistinctly ] [ man speaks indistinctly ] [ man speaks indistinctly ] [ man speaks indistinctly ] [ man grunting ] [ man speaks indistinctly ] [ wheel creaks ] [ wheels creaking ] [ indistinct chatter ] Prisoners were last seen at lights out , So , they must 've left sometime In the past 6 hours . Safe to say they headed for their dropship . But we 'll put davis on the search team Just to be safe . He taught earth skills . He 's dying to get some practical- - We 're not sending out a search team . That 'll put even more lives at risk . I 'm more worried about finding the people who helped them .. Abby : You wanted to see me ? Thank you , major . Tell me it wasn 't you . [ sigh ] Are we really back to this ? On the ark , you did anything you wanted . Without a second thought about the consequences . On the ark , i did what i needed to do , And i was right . Just like now . Letting prisoners go . Arming them . Those are serious crimes , abby . As chancellor , you can 't expect me to just- - You weren 't elected chancellor , marcus . You only got the job because Thelonious beat you to redemption . [ birds chirping ] Bellamy : All right , murphy . Where to now ? What say we lose these first , huh ? No . Again . If we get attacked out here , I have nothing to defend myself with . I don 't care . Thank you . Hey . What the hell are you doing ? It was your idea to bring him . Yeah , because he 's the only one who 's seen Where the grounders keep their prisoners . Then we probably shouldn 't let him Be defenseless out here . We can handle murphy . Better hope so . So , do i get a gun now ? Octavia : You 're going after the reapers . Lincoln taught me how to fight . Let me help . Kill her . [ grounders grunting ] [ grounders shouting indistinctly ] Jasper : I 'm gonna open my eyes now . Maya : No ! No peeking . Ok . Ok . Uh ... Where are you taking me , anyway ? Does the concept of surprise Mean something different in space ? You should know i don 't like surprises . I hate them , actually . Trust me . You 're gonna like this one . Open . [ gasp ] Oh , wow . Um , this one 's my favorite . Wallace goes in for landscapes and impressionists , But my taste runs a little darker . Beautiful , isn 't it ? Yeah . It is . I don 't know why they keep it all Locked up down here . It 's pretty cool . [ door opens ] man : Hey . Who 's in here ? Come on . You think we lost them ? I actually don 't think Anyone was ever chasing us . Jasper , have you seen clarke ? Uh , no . Nobody has . Hi . Hi . Um , you guys should- - No . No , we 're having breakfast . Gonna meet you in line ? I 've got a bad feeling . Look , i 'd love to talk to you about clarke , Any time in my entire life Other than right now , ok ? What if she 's in trouble ? [ sigh ] trouble ? It 's clarke . Whatever she 's up to , i 'm sure she can handle it . [ wheels creaking ] [ reaper speaking indistinctly ] [ reaper grunting ] [ reaper speaking indistinctly ] [ person screaming ] [ indistinct chatter ] Ok , come on . What are you doing ? Let 's go . [ crack ] [ indistinct chatter ] Everybody down . Down . Murphy : This is it . Told you i 'd find it . Bellamy : See nothing but grounders . Our people aren 't here . Finn : Wait a minute . They 've got stuff from our dropship . So , maybe they know where our friends are . Or maybe they killed them already . Sonofabitch . What is it ? The guy with the one eye . Around his neck . What am i looking at ? He 's got clarke 's watch . It was her father 's . She wouldn 't give that up without a fight . Neither will we . Ok . You 're with me . You two , stay here , out of sight . This thing goes south , take out the other grounders , But don 't shoot the grounder with the watch . Copy ? Copy . Copy . What about murphy ? Yeah , do i get a gun now ? Something like that . [ clacking ] [ clacking ] [ clacking ] [ clacking ] [ clacking ] Uhh ! We need to take him somewhere quiet . I know just the place . [ indistinct chatter ] You sent for me , sir ? Dr. Griffin has confessed to helping Those boys escape and giving them guns . She 's to be supervised at all times And confined to quarters when not at work . Is that clear ? What is it , major ? Spit it out . Unauthorized use of firearms And aiding and abetting a prison escape are felonies . The exodus charter is clear . The punishment is shocklashing . I know she 's your friend ... She 's not just my friend . She 's a former member of the council And the most respected person in this camp . Yes , sir , which is why it will work As a deterrent . On the ark , we had to be ruthless , uncompromising . Our hand was always forced . But down here ... We have a chance to start over . Make something better . I hope that day will come , sir . But if we lose control of this camp- - And we 're on the knife 's edge already- - We won 't live long enough to have that chance . Man : Grab somebody ... A patrol . The grounder prisoner . They 're bringing him in now . [ indistinct shouting ] Kane : Let that man through ! No one is to touch him ! Stand back ! Man : They have my son ! They have my son ! Where is my son ? Where is my son ? I want- - [ gunshot ] Medic ! We need a medic here ! What the hell happened ? He went for my weapon . Kept saying the grounders have his son . The gun just went off . Get him to medical now . Byrne : The knife 's edge , sir . Take the prisoner inside . Byrne : Go ! Everybody stay back . Stand back ! [ classical music playing ] Nice to see you , too . Sorry . I was hoping you were clarke . You still haven 't seen her ? No . I don 't think she slept in her bed last night . What do we do ? Maya has access to everything through her job . Maybe she could snoop around . If clarke 's in trouble , she can find out . I don 't know . Clarke doesn 't trust them . What if she 's right ? We can trust maya . At least , i think we can . Besides ... What choice do we have ? Damn it . This place is a maze . [ coughing ] What are they doing to us ? They use your blood . I saw a soldier come in with radiation burns . Hours later , he was fine . It 's like your blood is healing them somehow . I 've never seen anything like it . Come on . This way . Hey . Hey . What are you doing ? That 's the way back to the reapers . You go your way , i 'll go mine . Anya , we need to stick together . I told you there is no " we . " I saved your life . You saved my life because you need me . I know the way back to your people . I know where the traps are hidden . You 'd never make it alone . We don 't have time for this . Our best chance of making it out of here alive is together . All we can do is keep moving and hope- - [ whispering ] anya . Anya ? Stop ! We strike from the shadows When they stop to feed on our bait . So , i 'm the bait ? No . You are a warrior . She 's the bait . I am not afraid . You will be . [ speaking indistinctly ] [ speaking indistinctly ] [ reaper speaking indistinctly ] oh , no . [ reaper growling ] No , no . Please . [ growls ] [ screaming ] [ high-pitched beeping ] Get back ! Man : Get the hell away from her ! Now ! [ reapers screaming ] Man : Clarke griffin , you 're coming with us . Jackson , find out if he has any family . You need to come with us , ma 'am . What is this ? I 'm sorry it had to come to this , abby . But you left me no choice . Abigail griffin has confessed To aiding and abetting known criminals . And trafficking in firearms . Under the laws set forth in the exodus charter of the ark , She 's been sentenced to 10 lashes . [ crowd gasping ] You can 't be serious . On your command , chancellor kane . [ gasp ] We don 't have to do this down here . [ electricity humming ] Proceed . Aah ! Again . Aah ! [ grunting ] Again . [ electricity humming ] aah ! Ohh ! [ abby groaning ] Again . [ electricity humming ] aah ! We 're gonna do this again , And this time you 're gonna stop screwing with us . Where did you find this ? I told you . I found it outside your camp . He 's lying . She would never take it off voluntarily . I know . Where is the girl Who was wearing this watch ? I never saw a girl . Another lie . I mean , maybe you should stop asking him nicely . Shut up , murphy . Where are our friends ? You took them . We know you did . Just tell us where . Murphy 's right . We 're wasting time . Delano : Uhh ! Answer the question ! Bellamy : Hey . Where 's the girl Who was wearing this watch ? Bellamy : Finn , stop ! You don 't want to do this . Trust me . There are some lines you can 't uncross . Where 's clarke ? Delano : Uhh ! Where is she ? Back off ! Put down the gun , finn . [ cocks gun ] 3 seconds . Two ! One . Ok ! I 'll tell you . Your friends are east of here . The village where we take our prisoners of war . East ? Where ? How do we get to them ? I can draw you a map . But you should hurry . Soon they 'll outlive their usefulness . Get him something to draw a map . You thought i was the crazy one , huh ? Answer the question . Byrne : Answer the question ! Holster that weapon . Those men you killed were my men . I said stand down . Now ! You get some air . That 's an order . We can 't keep this up ... And hope to survive . [ sigh ] There 's gotta be a better way . Man : She 's in . [ speaking native language ] [ speaking native language ] [ growling ] Uhh ! Uhhhh ! Yah ! [ growling ] Uhh ! [ growling ] Uhh ! [ whispering ] lincoln . Where 's lincoln ? Where is lincoln ? Please . Was lincoln with you ? [ indistinct chatter ] [ crying ] [ screaming ] You find out something ? What is it ? Apparently , clarke had some kind of breakdown . She just snapped . Maya : Started pulling out her stitches , Trying to hurt herself . Where is she now ? Psych ward . Being monitored . I talked to a friend who works there . She thinks it might be a couple days Before the doctors let anyone see her . Monty : We 'll see about that . Hey ... I 'm sorry . Last time i saw her , i called her crazy . I never thought- - She 's gonna be ok . I saw everything . I know what you 're doing to them . That 's why you 're going in the harvest chamber with them . Alpha-delta two , we 've reached the intake . One prisoner in custody . Man on intercom : Your mission was to bring back both of them . The outsider cannot be allowed to leave this mountain . Alpha-delta one is coming out now . Aaaah ! Aah ! His mask ! Uhh ! I found a way out . This way . [ men screaming ] Man : We need to take them on . Wait . There has to be another way . There isn 't . Man : Just give up , clarke . You have no place else to go . Anya ! Man : We don 't have to kill you , clarke . Do you hear me ? It doesn 't have to end like this . Man : Just surrender . Man : Hands up . Take the prisoner . [ wincing ] Thank you , jackson . So ? Did it work ? Is the rest of the camp back in line ? This wasn 't something i ... I considered lightly . You don 't have to justify yourself . I broke the rules and i accept the consequences . But you can lash me a hundred times And i am still gonna do whatever it takes To find those kids . My kid . I know that . Then i guess we 're done here . [ grunts ] I 'm leading a mission to bring them back . This won 't be a ... Bunch of kids Looking to stir up a fight ... But a diplomatic mission To make contact with the grounders' commander ... And negotiate for peace . I 'm taking the grounder prisoner With me to guide the way . Marcus , he could be leading you into a trap . Perhaps . It 'll give us a chance . I did hear you , you know . Then i 'll go with you . No . No , you 're needed here at camp . No , jackson can handle medical . It 's not just your medical expertise That 'll be required . I need to know that while i 'm away , You 'll set a good example for our people . If you do this , i 'll be a model citizen . I need you to be more than that . I need you to be chancellor . Please , abby . For your people . [ indistinct chatter ] [ coughing ] [ gasping ] Thank you . I think we should go back to the dropship first . So i can see who my people ... We 're not going back to your dropship . You killed 300 of my warriors . I can 't show my face without a prize . Gather up the gear . We 're leaving . What about him ? For now , we leave him . Deal with him when we 're done . What if he escapes ? He knows exactly where we 're going . We 're not killing him . Murphy : I 'm not really seeing another option here . If we don 't take care of this now , This is gonna blow back on us and you know that . He 's unarmed , murphy . He 's a grounder . Really ? Come on . Tell him . I don 't know . You don 't know what ? He 's gonna tell his people everything . We 're as good as dead . Our friends , too . We 're not doing this . End of discussion . You want him , you gotta go through me . And what exactly happened to you , huh ? You 're talking like you 've never killed a grounder before . That was in battle . This would be an execution . [ gunshot ] Let 's get moving . [ door opens ] If you 're gonna kill me , get it over with . You proved yourself well , octavia of the sky people . We 'll let you live . Lincoln was a good man . He was my brother . [ groaning ] Man : All right . Next . Harvest . Harvest . Harvest . Mark this one for the cerberus program .

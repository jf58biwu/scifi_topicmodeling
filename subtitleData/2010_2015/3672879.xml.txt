 This is what Destiny intended from the moment it entered the system . We are going to survive . We are going to make it home . The ship came here for a reason ! Destiny is powered by the stars themselves . He and Young are bumping heads . Not sure which camp is the better choice . We pretend nothing happened . We need to be ready for the next encounter . For the sake of the crew . For the sake of the crew . I 'm not sick . What about the father ? This is unlike other kind of technology we 've encountered before . If they 're indigenous to this universe , they might be willing to trade . You lost the kino ? No , I took a wrong turn trying to steer it out . I just need to take a look and get my bearings . We haven 't found any other sort of exit , or access to ground level . - We 're not going to make it . - Fire in the hole ! - It didn 't had the desired effect . - We just made things worse . God be with you , Colonel . Riley ... Eli would want someone documenting the efforts to rescue the team left behind . Given that Eli is one of the team that was left behind , I would have thought he 'd want everyone doing anything possible to help rescue them . You didn 't like my idea . Telling Destiny to go back isn 't going to work . - How do you know ? - Because I 've already tried it ! I 'm done . The Stargate aboard this ship is much more primitive than the later models found in the Milky Way . As you can see from this map , each time Destiny stops , it 's in range of only a small group of gates . That means the next time we drop out of FTL , the planet the team was stranded on will no longer be in range of Destiny . However , Dr. Rush and Mr. Brody are working on ... That 's weird . What happened ? The battery must have died . I just got this one . It wasn 't me . I am not the sort of person who just jumps into bed with anyone . I thought we ... Colonel Young asked you to check on me . Yes , but he 's asking me to keep tabs on everybody . He believes in you . He doesn 't have much choice . I 'm also here because I 'm your friend . I 'm sorry , it 's just that ... Rush , come in . Several systems are down . Looks like Destiny 's activated some kind of power-saving mode . That 's strange , our reserves are at maximum capacity from the last recharge . Life support 's fine . I should be able to work round it , get the lights back on in a couple of minutes . Maybe we shouldn 't . What ? Work around it . There 's got to be a good reason . This whole ship is falling apart . Computers don 't last forever . Maybe it 's a malfunction . We 're not going to be able to do anything in the dark . We have two days of water , tops . We 'll find more . Step one , we get out of these tunnels . We 're off to a bad start . We 'll find food and water . - They can 't turn the ship around . - We 'll use the gates to catch up . In order to connect the dots between here and the Destiny , there have to be gates in range of each other between this planet and wherever Destiny stops next . Plus , this remote only tells you which gates are in range of this planet , not where they are . There 's no way to know which direction we 'd be going . And in case that 's not bad enough , we have no idea where Destiny went . - One step at a time . - Let 's keep a positive attitude . C4 blast could have destabilized the whole place . - Great . - We had to take the risk . We 're seriously ... All we can do right now is keep moving . Son of a ... What do we know ? Not much . Several nonessential systems automatically shut down . We still only have limited control . How about rescuing the team we left behind ? We won 't know if the planet they were left on is reachable until we 've dropped out of FTL . This is crazy . You 'd think some of these tunnels would lead somewhere . No wonder the people that built this place died out . They probably all got lost down here . Just wandered around thinking , " If only we had thought to put in a few more exits . " Or one of those maps you see in a mall with a big red dot . " You are here . " How hard is that ? I 'd kill for a big red dot right now . I can 't take this anymore . All right , let 's stop , take a quick breather . Five minutes . Still looking for that kino ? So what are you doing ? I 've been thinking about using the gates . And ? I may have painted an overly bleak picture before . I 'll admit , I was freaking out a bit . And now ? We do know that Destiny is traveling down a path , basically a corridor of gates left behind by the ships that were sent in advance . It meanders somewhat , but generally , it heads in one direction . They wouldn 't put gates on every planet . Obviously not . People don 't realize how big a galaxy is . Anyway ... Let 's say the gates in range of the planet we 're on are in this circle . This circle represents the gates in range of Destiny the next time it drops out of FTL . We need to get to that circle . Yeah , right . Now , hopefully , there are gates in range of each other between these circles . Once we are in range of Destiny , the address will show up on here . You see how easy it is to make a simple map ? How do we know we 're going the right way ? We don 't , but if we do go the wrong way , we 'll either run out of addresses because we 've hit the edge of the corridor , or we 'll run into planets we 've been to before or at least addresses I 'll hopefully remember or recognize , but ... At least it 's a 50-50 shot . Good . - We should really get moving . - Why ? It hasn 't been five minutes . Eli , seriously ! Are you seeing what I 'm seeing ? I suspected as much . If it 's true ... I know . You 're not going to tell Young ? It 's not certain . You have to tell him . She 's upset . We all are . But she 's fine , though ? I don 't have to worry about putting her back out there ? A few words of encouragement from you wouldn 't hurt , though . She thinks that you 're only send her because you don 't have a choice ... I don 't . I know you think she 's a good soldier . Is she aware I know about her relationship with Scott ? She 's not over him , either , but that 's not an issue . Thanks . There 's something else ... I need to tell you . That sounds serious . - Colonel Young , come in . - Rush , go ahead . You 're gonna wanna see this . I 'll be right there . You were going to say ? It can wait . It 's more of a longer conversation . When I was left behind on that planet with the crashed alien ship ... I remember . One of the things I saw there appeared to be a map of this galaxy . - Including the Stargates . - And ? Mr. Brody and myself have been working on our own map , based on our own records of where Destiny has been thus far . I thought Destiny had a map of where it 's been . But we 're trying to create a clearer picture of the galaxy ... Just cut to the chase . I was hoping to have some better news , but if I 'm right ... Then we are at the very edge of this galaxy . Now , how is that bad news ? Destiny travels between galaxies . Yeah , but the space between galaxies is huge . Empty . That 's why that power-saving protocol kicked in ? I don 't know , it could be , but there will be no more gates . No chance of dialing back to this system . If we don 't find them the next time we drop out of FTL ... We won 't have another chance . Oh , my God . What ? The kino . Look , look , an exit ! - The kino found an exit . - That 's awesome . Where 's the kino ? - I have no idea . - Right . Exactly . At least now we know that there is a way out of here . Left or right ? What 's it going to be ? We 're traveling blind , so what difference does it make ? Left . I like left . No offense to what you like , man , but ... He 's right . We should go left . How do you know ? Because that 's what this map says . There 's been a few of these along the way . I thought they were just decorative at first . So far they 've been the same except for one thing . This symbol seems to be in different places . " You are here . " There have been maps down here this whole time ? That 's awesome . Are you sure ? Well , this seems to be the fork we 're standing at . There 's only one way to find out . - What are you doing ? - Going to go look for another one . Greer ! She 's right . There 's another map ... I tried . I did , really ! I was about to tell him , and then he got called away by Rush . You should have told him anyway . It sounded important . So is this . - I know . - He 's going to find out soon enough . I mean , you 're starting to show . I know . Are you afraid of what he 's going to say ? Or not say , I don 't know . Tell him right now . It just seems like there 's always something . Matt ! I 'm fine . Oh , my God . Come in , Greer ! Ron , can you hear me ? Maybe the signal can 't penetrate the rocks . We could hear James pretty clearly . Three hours . Besides dialing , checking for safe environment , roughly eight to ten minutes per planet . Factor in time to get back , we 'll be able to see roughly 20 planets . At least we know the direction to go in . We 'll find them , Sir . Good luck . Colonel , it 's TJ , come in ? Go ahead . Have they left ? Unfortunately , it 's a very short window . Do you have some time to talk in private ? I 'm on my way to see to Dr. Volker , talk about the charging plates , putting them back online . Nothing seems to be working around here . Can it wait ? Come on , buddy ! Wait , wait . All right , stop ! Stop moving rocks . We need to get out of here . Look , I saw those rocks coming down ... He would want us to get out of here , especially if there was no hope for him . You just say that because you think you need to get us out . Gear up . Give me a second here . Just ... Go . Look , Greer ? I 'm sorry , man . Move , move , move , this thing 's coming down . Please . The boy has to eat . Look , don 't you go near there . - You got to let him out . - I don 't got to do nothing ! Mom ? The boy has to learn . Can anybody hear me ? I 'm here ! Scott , this is Greer , come in . Come in ... At least the tremors have stopped . Probably got far enough from the cave-in . I 'll go . Done . Done . He wasn 't always like this . You say that all the time . He was a good man , a good father . - You were too young to remember . - I hate him . It 's not his fault . Don 't care . You need to be strong . I know you got it in you . He needs us , both of us . Nobody else is going to take care of him . We need to go . Where ? Far away . Both of us . We need to get out of here . Eli , hold up a second . What ? I 'm saying maybe the thing to do is stay put . If it is possible to connect the dots between here and Destiny , then Colonel Young is going to send a team back to look for us . We 'd be better off waiting for them to find us . We don 't know how long Destiny is going to stop for . There might not be enough time for them to get here , and then to gate back to Destiny . We need to take the chance . Okay , dial it . It 's hard to see . Looks pretty foggy . But everything else is good . It 's safe to go . Get out . Get out . I don 't have any money . Probably a good thing down here . It 'll take a minute for the Gate list to refresh . If Destiny 's in FTL , it won 't show up , right ? Right . Shouldn 't we spend more time on these planets , to see if it does ? What if it is out of FTL , but just one planet away from here ? See , I knew this was a bad idea . Didn 't you say we should stop being negative ? 10 minutes . We give each planet ... - You hear that ? - Of course we heard it . Dial the Gate . I 'm dialing . Dial faster . I 'm dialing ! Holy ... Go ! Mom , we have to go ! Mom , wake up ! You should 've let me burn . It 's beautiful . Not that I 'd want to be stuck here for a long time , but it is an incredible sight to see . This is our tenth planet . We have less than an hour and a half . This is a lot more complicated than I 'd anticipated . Who 'd have guessed Destiny had skipped over so many planets with Gates on them ? Getting back should be much quicker . We have extra kinos and a remote . Time to split up , cover more planets . Agreed . We 're going to find them . We just need a bit of luck . I 'm afraid I don 't believe in that . So you 'll take one team and I 'll take the other ? The fires ... The fires were everywhere . That oil burned hot . Got so we forgot what a clean breath of air felt like . Emphysema , asthma , bronchitis . They said none of the guys sent in to put out the fires showed any effects . Come on , you buy that ? How can that be true ? Those fires were everywhere ... The man 's a living hell . Sent by the devil himself to torture me for all eternity . Just a little skin reaction , they said . Just a little itchy on the arm . The FDA approved it though it 'd never been through any large-scale trials . There were no side effects . They said it was the war , not the vaccine . Between 1998 and 2000 , 20,000 soldiers had to be hospitalized after receiving the vaccine even though they had never been deployed overseas . The Pentagon failed to report that to Congress ! Wasn 't as bad as the sand fleas , though . They got under your skin and how . Carried all kinds of diseases . Diseases you can 't even say . Tank busters . Uranium depleted . I loaded those munitions . Nothing dangerous coming off those . What do you think ? 18,000 times in two years those alarms went off . It 's not the mustard gas , never the mustard gas ! It was cigarettes . Deodorant ! Can you believe that ? Chronic fatigue , loss of muscle control , headaches , dizziness , memory loss , shortness of breath , brain cancer ... I 'm going to kill him . Put him out of his misery . It was the war . It was the war ! It wasn 't the fires . They were everywhere . Big black billowing smoke . The war is why he can 't breathe . Listen , I 'm sorry . One thing turned into another . Next thing I know , a 5-minute update ... I 'm pregnant . You 're pregnant ? How far along are you ? About 22 weeks . It 's yours . Ours . A baby . On this ship ... I 'm keeping it . No , I didn 't ... I didn 't say you shouldn 't . What are you saying ? We 're going to make this work . That 's what we 're going to do , we 're going to make it work . This is a problem . What ? The kino says the atmosphere on the planet we just sent it to is toxic . - We can 't go through . - We can 't get that kino back . And we won 't know if the next address we try is safe . - Dial another one . - But I just said that ... - We can 't stay here , can we ? - No , no , but I ... You stay , I 'll go , I 'll go . I 'll radio back if it 's safe . Look , we stay here , we 're as good as dead anyway . Dial another one . They left you . Abandoned you . They did what they had to do . - They thought I was dead . - Nobody 's going to save you . Nobody cares . In the end , all there is is you . You alone . Doctor says there 's an infection in his brain . There 's nothing they can do for him . I enlisted . What for ? I didn 't get the scholarship . But you worked so hard . Wasn 't fast enough . You always said it wasn 't his fault . His choice wasn 't wrong . He just wanted to be somebody . I want to be somebody . You don 't have anything to prove to anyone . You didn 't let him change you . Nothing can hurt the spirit God gave you ... I have to use it . Don 't I ? To make a difference . You can still change your mind . I 'm not going to . All right , I 'm okay . It 's cold and dark , but I can breathe , and there 's no crazy dinosaurs , at least not yet . Come on through . It 's kind of pretty . Sometimes we would spend Christmas at a cabin in Vermont . Amazing ... that a planet on the other side of the universe can remind you of Vermont . Here we go , the next set of addresses . Oh , God ... What ? I recognize this one . - One we 've been to before ? - Not recently . That 's not good . It 's the one with the downed alien ship . The planet Rush was stranded on . We 've been heading the wrong way . Okay , so what now ? Can we retrace our steps ? Wait ... We should go to this planet . Why ? Look , even if we retrace our steps and try this all again with different choices , we 're traveling blind . Rush said he we was able to boot up the computer on that alien ship . Yeah , and that 's what brought the aliens . But in the small time that he was there , he was able to glean some information about the shape of this galaxy and where the Stargates are . If I can do the same , we won 't have to stumble around . We 'd have a map . Okay , but what about the aliens ? Believe me , you do not want to end up a prisoner on one of those ships . I realize we might not have much time . We 'll have to get in and out quickly . If they 're not there now . I hope this is a good idea . All right , come on . How about this ? We 're in the right place . I didn 't see any other Alien spaceships , did you ? Clock is ticking . I know , I know . 15 minutes . - Where 'd you get that number ? - I like it . This is an Alien spaceship . Exactly . 15 minutes , that 's it . End of discussion . Nice work , Lieutenant . Thank you , sir . Any word from Rush ? Not yet . I 'm glad you made it back . They thought I was dead . I don 't think they would have left me otherwise . I hope that choice doesn 't mean we 've lost them . None of this makes any sense . - Okay , time 's up , we need to walk away . - Not yet . Wait . - You said none of this makes sense ... - I know . I know . Go back . - What do you mean ? - The screens , go back . There ! Select that . There it is . How did you know that ? I don 't know . Can you read this ? No , I just ... Know what it means ? Can you use this to get us back to Destiny or not ? I think so . - We have to hurry , though . - Why ? If I 'm reading this right , Destiny is about to leave the galaxy . If we don 't get back on board before it does , we 're going to be stranded for good . Game over . Five minutes . Seriously , there was no quicker way ? If I 'm right , this planet should be just ... There it is ! Destiny ! Dial ! Down to the wire . Incoming wormhole . You cut it close . And the others were not with him . What happened ? I don 't know . It didn 't connect . - Why not ? - I don 't know ! So where are they ? Again . - What happened ? - I said I don 't ... What ? The address disappeared . How can it be there one second and gone the next ? They jumped . We missed it . We must have just ... missed it . That 's it . We 're done . I 'm trying to carry on for Eli . Don 't you think he 'd want me to ? I think it 's important . I know you 've been through a lot . I only need a minute or two . What happened on the planet ? People are going to want to hear your story . Maybe another time .

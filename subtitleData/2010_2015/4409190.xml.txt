 Woooh ! You see that Dan ? Wooh ! Don 't forget your coat . I wouldn 't need one if you let me stay here . Ah . That 's you fault , not mine . I 'm not the one that got expelled the day before her father went on a trip . Why can 't I stay home ? It 's not like I need a babysitter . You know , I would 've agreed with you if you hadn 't gotten into a fight at school . It wasn 't even a fight . All I did was shove her , and she deserved it . Oh , and if she didn 't deserve it and you punched her anyway . Shoved her . And she totally went after Blake even though she knew I liked him . That 's funny . I don 't remember you ever mentioning Blake before . That 's because you don 't listen . Did you get anything to eat , 'cause we got to go soon . Dad . You are coming with me , Emmy . I can stay at Lena 's . Oh , that 's right , and do what while she 's at school ? Well , what am I going to do in ... Canada . I don 't know . Maybe you can make up on all that homework you 've missed for one . Blah . Sweetheart . You can make snow angels , you can build a snowman . You can help us with our work . I really don 't care . Research ? Yeah , no thank you . There are animals . Maybe that 'll help you out . Yeah , whatever . What do you guys even do there anyway ? We track down animals that we 've been following for years and we see how they 're doing . We measure changes in their environment , we ... Boring . You are coming with me and you don 't have a leg to stand on , and you know it , because if you thought you had a leg to stand on you would not have packed your bag . Ha , ha . High five . Whatever . Get in the car . This is going to be so lame . Hi guys . Emmy , you remember Rob and Marci , two very important parts of our research team from the university . Hi Emmy . Look out . Come on guys . Let 's go before it gets too dark . Yeah , we don 't want to get lost like last time . Have you seen them today ? Nope . I guess they didn 't want to make an appearance until you showed up . We haven 't even been out at all . We 've been stocking the cabin . Anything good ? It 's all good , as long as Marci doesn 't cook it . Hey ! Maybe Emmy can help out with that . What 's that ? Ski resort . Did you guys know that , uh , over 15 million people ski or snowboard in North America alone ? Fascinating . Nice . How do they have time for that ? Hey , can we go skiing ? We 're here to work , Em . No , you 're here to work , Dad . We have two snowmobiles . Maybe you could take a ride on one ... with your dad driving , of course . With your dad driving , of course . Hey , grab some of them push pins , will ya ? Hurry , we got a lot of these to do today . One thing you got to realize , kid , is people go missing . It happens out here sometimes . Especially during spring break season . All those college kids drift too far away from their fancy resorts and freeze . Others get buried in an avalanche . It happens ? That 's your philosophy ? When you 've been around as long as I have , you 'll get what I mean . Yeah , thanks Gibbons . Trying to save the world . I got to save the world before he eats it . Home , sweet home . For one week out of the year , anyway . This is where you guys come ? Yep . We 're in the middle of nowhere . You thought I was kidding , didn 't you ? No , really , like nowhere . We 're actually only six miles from the resort as the crow flies , but with the mountains and windy roads it 's ... Thanks , Rob . As the crow flies ? What ? They 're crows . They fly . Satellite all hooked up and ready to go ? It 's sketchy . Sketchy ? It 's on my to do list . Great . My cell phone doesn 't work . Oh , duh . There 's not a cell tower around here , silly . That 's no excuse . I guess you 're just going to have to settle for real human interaction . Hmmm . Why don 't you help get dinner ready ? Yeah , I 'm not hungry . We all pitch in around here , Emmy . Why don 't you make yourself in charge of getting meals ready ? Nice try . I 'm not your slave . Do you really think I 'm out of line asking you to assume just a little bit of responsibility ? Hmmm . That 's funny . Where have I heard that before ? Oh yeah , that 's exactly what you told mom right before she split . Help with the food . Now . Bad time ? Uh huh . Whatcha got ? Satellite 's going to be iffy for a couple days . Why is that ? I don 't know . I think it 's a hardware problem . Something with the satellite service centre . Well , maybe Rob can help us out with some trivial information . True . Anything else ? Yeah . So last year I published this paper on tar sand mining and the effects it has on wildlife 's water sources . That was you ? Yeah . Yeah , that was me . I , I am so amazed . I mean I had no idea you were so smart and hot . But you know , maybe you should try like spiking the hair , get a haircut , lose the flan . .ooh , yeah , lose the flannel . And then untuck the shirt . Emmy . Emmy . Knock it off . Come on Dad . We 're just catching up , you know , old times . He 's twice your age , and he 's not interested . Knock it off . You 're not interested . Hey . Satellite ? Uh , no luck . Keep trying , though , okay ? Of course . You think I can go a week without my email ? Hah , well , I don 't know , you might survive . Emmy all settled in ? I guess she is . I went up to her door , it 's closed and I hear that angry music coming through those ear things she wears 24 / 7 . Rough time . When , um , when Kim , uh , when Kim left us , Emmy just kind of got quiet . All of a sudden she didn 't talk to me , she didn 't talk to anybody , really . And then for no reason I can wrap my dad head around , she turned into one of those lashing out at everything , angry teenage things , you know ? I miss the quiet Emmy . No , you miss the happy Emmy before Kim left . Yeah , but I honestly don 't think there 's much chance of that Emmy ever coming back . You ever hear from Kim ? Well , maybe it 's time to move on . Goodnight . Goodnight . Quitting time . Yeah , you go ahead . What 's with the pins ? Nothing . Oh , if you can 't tell your partner , who can you tell ? You 're not going to care . Try me . I 've been pulling up some past reports of missing persons and the places they were seen last . If you want to be a detective I know someone at the RCMP . You see , I knew you wouldn 't listen . You 're taking this snowboarder too seriously . The rescue teams searched all over for him . Nothing . Yeah , well they didn 't search everywhere . I mean the places that they 're searching barely intersect the places where people were last seen . And they barely intersect the places where people said they saw something . Something ? An animal . An animal that made all these people disappear ? Fine . Don 't believe me . You know what this snowboarder 's probably doing ? What ? Running . From an ex-girlfriend , bad debts . He 's probably in Paris right now starting over . You 're caught up in your own imagination , kid . Stop calling me kid . Lock up when you 're done , Barry . I knew I wasn 't lost [ HEAVY BREATHING , PANTING ] This is really strange . None of the radio tags are showing up . None of them ? Maybe the lynx are hunting farther away . Or all the ones that were tagged have moved on ? Or all the transmitters have gone bad , but that 's not very likely . No . We don 't have any idea where to start looking . I 'll tell you what . Let 's set up all your cameras . Maybe we 'll find a den in the process . Imagine how thick our coats would have to be if we were here mid winter . Huh . Did you know that wearing cotton actually increases your chances of hypothermia ? Really ? Yeah . Synthetic fabrics and , uh , wool actually do better at drying and insulating . Fascinating . Have fun . Hey , why don 't you come with us ? Oh , yeah , trudging through the snow looking for some animal sounds like so much fun , but I think I 'll pass . Okay , since you 're going to pass I want you to stay here in the cabin . If you get in any trouble , if you need me for any reason call me on the radio . Alright ? The radio , right here . The radio . Push this button . Hello ? What am I suppose to do ? How about your homework ? Sweetheart , this can be a really fun place . Why don 't you try to have a goodtime , okay ? Be sure you set the camera to motion activated recording , okay ? Got it . Wasn 't this a den ? Be careful , we don 't want to disturb anything . There aren 't any tracks , but it 's got to be a den . Yeah , you 're right . Nothing . Crap . Where ? Not droppings . The camera 's not working . Fixable ? Yeah , I think I can find something at the resort stores . Really ? It 's just a cable , I think . Look , I 'm going to go finish setting up the rest of the cameras , and then I 'm going to head back to the cabin , pick up the truck . Okay . Okay . Hey Emmy , have you seen the keys to the truck ? Where are you going ? To the store . Maybe they 're in Jim 's room . Found them . Emmy ? No change in the snow pack ? Nah , nothing substantial . Certainly nothing to indicate why the lynx aren 't here anymore . Yeah , but we found dens and litters last year . Maybe they 're going to come out at night . They like it better then . Yeah , but I 've been coming here four years , you even longer . It 's a lot of work . Imagine if all of our research just disappeared . This isn 't the only research we 're doing . Yeah , but ... Yeah , but what ? What about our expedition to Antarctica ? We 've been putting in a request every year . It 's not going to happen through the university . We need big results . Look , the lynx project is not dead . I think you just get yourself all worked up about nothing . I have some new leads , some fresh funding . Really ? Who ? It 's a very wealthy family . All of a sudden they want to go green . Yeah , so they can get a big fat tax write off to fund their new hobby . Don 't tell me you wouldn 't be excited about it . Peace , quiet , ice , you , me , maybe Rob . Yeah . Hey , you 're with that research team , right ? Yeah , Barry , right ? Yeah , good memory . So , where 's , uh , Gibbons ? He 's waiting on lunch . Ah , he hasn 't changed much . So anything new around here ? Nah . Well there 's a snowboarder that went missing a couple days ago , but besides that , Gibbons doesn 't like to leave the comforts of the office , so the only wildlife I usually end up seeing is ... Nice . Yours is pretty good . Spyder . I try . Um , sorry , I 'm ... Ah , no problem . Tell Gibbons hi Sure . You want to give it a try . Yeah , I 've only ever skied . Maybe after we can get some lunch . Emmy ? I 'm busy . No , you 're not . Hey we 're ... Not anymore . Say goodbye to your friend . Hey ! What are you doing ? You don 't know him . So . Hey , can you slow down ? We 're almost there . I thought you said this was going to be fun . This is fun . Yeah , right . Did you see that ? Uh , uh . What ? I don 't know . Kenny ? Kenny ? So how were you planning to get back to the cabin ? I don 't know . Big planner , aren 't you ? I doubt my dad would have even noticed . Yeah . He would have noticed the minute he stepped in the cabin . And that 's assuming he 's not there already . So what is it about the animals that make you guys come up here every year ? The lynx ? They 're a threatened species in the US . But they do okay out here , though . So . Why study them ? Well , we can learn a lot from them , from nature . Okay , well , take how they hunt for example . They sometimes sneak upon their prey within a couple bounds , and then they pounce . They get that close and the prey doesn 't even realize it until it 's too late . What ? So we can learn how to be sneaky from them ? Survival . You know , a predator is completely silent . You 'd think they roar before an attack , but they don 't . No , they wait . And then they get close . And then they kill . No warning , just efficient meal time . That 's gross . And I 'm pretty sure he makes a noise or something before he pounces , or whatever . Oh really ? Well when was the last time you were hunted ? I 'm just saying . Well what you might hear is the blood rushing through your own head . Something the fear triggers when you see a predator . Where 'd you go ? Ah - She was bored , so she tagged along with me to the store and back . Really ? Yeah , sorry . I didn 't think you 'd mind . I don 't mind at all . Just next time you leave this cabin you let me know . Thanks . I 'd say ' anytime ' but I , I don 't think you should do that again . Yeah . You weren 't kidding . No I was not . Please save us from a repeat tomorrow . You got it . Anyone want dessert ? Uh ... no . I got them at the store . Oh , okay . Yeah , I 'll have one . Thanks for dinner Marci . Stop being polite . Hey , it wasn 't my favourite meal , but it 's better than starving . Not by much . Thank you . No offence . None taken . None taken . So , you guys see anything while I was gone ? Um , uh . Not even a single snow shoe hare . Rabbit . Yeah , I was thinking , maybe something happened to their food source . Maybe that 's why they left . Does that mean we can go home ? No , that does not mean we can go home . We don 't know that they 've all left , silly . We 'll see what the cameras pick up tonight . Don 't they sleep ? No , they 're more active at night . They hunt at night . They better show up . Oh , that 's a great idea . Threaten them , Marci , that always works really well , yeah . Are you two dating ? Emmy ! Not yet . Marci ! And you , I taught you better than that . You don 't go blurting things out like that . Come on . I think I 'm going to go to bed . And I 'm going to take out the trash . Good idea . What ? You like her . No . Marci is my , my colleague , okay ? That 's all . And ? And nothing . We 're colleagues , we work together , nothing , that 's it . Nothing . We 're not dating . Dad , I 'm not blind . And isn 't she a little young for you . How old to you think I am ? It doesn 't matter how old you think I am because we 're not dating , okay , we 're not dating . Not yet . Checking the camera ? Uhuh . There 's only a few files . Oh really ? Not much moving out there . Hey , what 's this ? Right there . I do not know . Let 's run it back . It 's just a blur . I asked for better cameras at the last budget and what do I get ? Just a blur . Well , good morning sunshine . You 're up a whole lot earlier than I thought you 'd be . Yeah , I 'm hungry . Yeah , well that meal last night didn 't really hold any of us over . Yeah . So what do you say ? Do you want to go with us today ? Can I drive the snowmobile ? No . There 's a good spot right up here to put the last camera . You fixed it , right ? Yeah . Hey Dad ? Yeah , just a second Emmy . Just a second . How about that ? Yeah , that 's a perfect spot . What is it ? I don 't know . Jim , can you take a look at this ? Sure . Whatcha got ? Tracks . Tracks ? What kind of tracks ? A little big for a lynx , isn 't it ? Those , uh , those aren 't lynx , sweetheart , they 're maybe bear . Not really sure what species , though . I want you to stay close to us the whole time , okay ? Dad . Just do it . The tracks go that way . They 're hard to see . I heard something last night . An animal , large by the sound of it . Where ? It was away from the cabin . It was a ... .. it was like a snarl . Snarl ? Yeah . It 's the only way I can describe it . Anyway , it got me inside real quick . So , any truth to last 's night conversation ? Nothing beyond the idea . Alright . You know , every year we come out here I feel like a third wheel . So when are you going to do something ? I guess when Jim 's ready . He 's not over Kim yet . And what about Emmy ? I 'll leave that between Emmy and Jim . You see there . That , that 's kind of cool . Isn 't it ? I mean you can tell that the litter was here with the female . Where did she go ? That 's what we 're trying to figure out . I , I don 't know . Maybe , the uh , maybe the mother lynx just had to move on . Would she have taken her litter with her ? Well , that depends . I mean , sometimes , the circumstances might be such that the mother has to leave . But she would never do that unless she was sure that they were strong enough to take care of themselves . She cares about them . She cares about them . So , strike ... two on the lynx . Theories ? Maybe we rely on evidence . Well , that 's kind of difficult . We don 't have any evidence . Trappers . We can talk to the rangers , see if they have any information . That 's legal ? It 's legal to trap as long as they follow the rules and regulations . We actually haven 't seen the prey for the lynx . Maybe that 's the problem . Maybe they 've moved on to a territory with a better food source . Yeah , but what about the prey ? The snowshoe hare . The hare population goes up and down from year to year , but to disappear entirely from one season to the next ? It doesn 't make any sense . Maybe something else is eating the snowshoe hare . Or maybe something else is eating the lynx . That 's good . But the lynx is pretty high up on the food chain , sweetie . What about those tracks ? I mean , do bears eat lynx ? Ahhh , a bear might eat a lynx if it found a carcass on the side of the road , it might even challenge one if it meant survival , but it 's wintertime . The bears are hibernating . Speaking of survival , dinner 's ready . Great . Yes . Dish me up some . I 'm going to go grab some firewood . What is it ? I don 't know . Careful . Where is it ? It 's right outside . It tore up our snowmobile . I don 't see anything . Anybody see anything ? No , should we go check it out ? No , it 's too late . Let 's do that first thing in the morning . Come on , let 's go back to bed . Go back to bed . Come on , sweetie . Back to bed . It 's toast . Do you think they 'll give us our deposit back ? Look at the spacing of the tracks . It 's not walking on four legs . It 's walking upright . Bears walk upright . That far ? Maybe it felt threatened ? Yeah . I 'm going to go to the Ranger 's station , let them know this happened . Yeah , see if anybody else is having trouble . Sure , sure . Yep . Uh huh . See ya tonight , hon . Hi there . Hey Gibbons . Um , we 're up here for our yearly research , you know , that thing we 're always doing . Oh , the wild cat . Lynx . Oh , how 's it going ? Well , it could be better . We had a visitor last night . What kind of visitor ? I ... I don 't know . Could be a bear . It ripped up one of our snowmobiles and tossed some garbage around . Yeah , bears do that . Well , assuming it 's a bear . I wanted to see if you 've heard of any other reports , or anything going on in the area ? Where is it you said you 're staying again ? They 're up on the high road near Jake 's lane . Come on . What 's the matter ? Camera 5 went down again . Thought you said you fixed it . I thought I did . All the other ones look fine . Get up . Come on . Okay , let 's see and this , and pahhh . Yeah . I 'll go fix it . Let 's take the tranq gun . You guys have a gun . Yeah . Tranq gun , tranquilizer . Just in case . I 'll go with you . What about Emmy ? Yeah , what about me ? Testing one , two , three . Emmy , do you hear me ? I hear you Dad . Thank you . Why 'd ya stop ? I thought I saw something out there . Nothing 's out there . I 'm going to go check it out . Fine . I 'll stay with the truck . Gibbons ? Gibbons ? Can I give you a hand with anything ? No , hopefully it 's something simple . Emmy , are you there ? Yeah , Dad . Where else would I be ? Look , I want you to keep your eye on the monitors and let me know if you see anything , alright ? I know , I know . Teenagers . Let 's go already . Hey Barry ! Barry ! Field trip 's over , kid ! Barry ! Barry ? This better not be some kind of prank . Okay . How about that ? Okay , Emmy . How about that ? Nothing . Okay . How about now ? Okay , Emmy . How about now ? Okay . Now all I see is Rob 's face . Ha , ha . Alright , better ? How 's the picture quality ? Ahhhhh , umph ! Aahhh . Rob ! Rob ! Rob , you okay ? Yeah , I think so . Oh , that hurt . Yeah , I 'll bet it did . Dad ? Are you guys okay ? Yeah , honey , I 'm fine . I 'm fine , sweetheart . Um , Rob fell in a hole . I don 't suppose there 's a ladder down there , huh ? Real funny . Looks like some kind of cave or something . Well , hang tight . I 'll find another way in . Don 't go anywhere . Rob ? Rob ? Hey Rob , can you hear me ? Yeah , yeah , I 'm over here . Dad ? Yeah , Emmy . I think I see something . Something ? Where ? On the camera . Dad ? What ? It 's ... I don 't know what it is . Emmy , what camera did you say you saw it on ? Camera 2 . Hey , There 's something . Emmy , I want you to radio me right away if you see anything else . Jim . Take a look . Ranger said someone went missing a couple days ago . He 's not missing anymore . Dad , it 's back . What ? At the cabin ? No , no , but he 's moving fast . He 's on camera 3 now . Camera 2 to 3 . He 's coming right toward us . He 's coming home . And fast . Emmy , I want you to describe it to me . It 's a ... is it a bear ? No , it ... it 's bigger than that . Uh , Jim ? Let 's get out of here . Yeah . Dad ? Dad , he 's on camera 4 now . Come on . Dad ? Hurry up ! Okay , I see you . Hurry , Jim . I 'm trying . Well , go ! The rangers said they haven 't heard of any other reports . And they said there 's probably a bear in the area . Now , look , there are over thirty classifications of bears , and that did not look like any of them . It 's hard to tell what it is . You didn 't get a better look ? It 's hard to get a better look when you 're running for your life . We need to tell the authorities about the body , and the whatever it is . What we need to do is we need to leave , first thing in the morning . Leave ? Yeah . That 's probably what drove the lynx away . No , it 's probably what killed all the lynx . Yeah , but we need to find out for sure . Why ? Why don 't I give you a hand with dinner , sweetheart ? You know what ? There 's nothing to look at now the lynx are gone . Have we ever seen anything like this ? No , and I don 't want to ever see anything like that again . How 's this ? Chicki-bits , okay ? You alright ? We 're leaving tomorrow . First thing . Good . This whole thing 's got you scared too , huh ? What ? If I wasn 't here , would you go looking for it ? Hmm , no . Promise . Yeah . Okay . Okay . We going to talk about this ? Is the satellite fixed ? No . It doesn 't really matter since we 're leaving first thing in the morning anyway . Okay . If this creature killed the lynx , that 's critical to our research . I 'm not going back out there to verify that . Think about the creature . If we 're the first ones to discover this , that 's huge . It 's only huge if the creature is something special . If it 's nothing special , then it doesn 't make any difference . You couldn 't identify it . No , I could not identify it because I was too busy running away from it . Rob , you always have these theories and facts to back it up . Care to share ? Well , it could be a mutation or cross breed . I mean new species are discovered all the time . Oh , really ? New species this size ? I don 't think so . Or it could be a yeti . I 'm sorry . What ? Well , a yeti . A snowman . You know , the abominable snowman . No , no , no . Go on . Well it 's not like a bear , you know , like a mountain bear , polar bear , whatever . It 's body is just , is different . K , I 'm not , I 'm not saying that I , I believe in this yeti thing , but don 't they supposedly live in the Himalayas ? Well , yeah . Sightings put them in Tibet and Nepal , but they have white fur like we saw and they run upright . I mean , you saw the footage . It never went down on all fours . A bear would . Any creature that I know of would . See Jim , we could be on to something . I 'm not saying we go look for it . Why not ? I 'm , I 'm sorry , but um , just exactly how did this yeti get here ? What 'd it do ? Hop on a plane , get some peanuts , watch a movie ? I don 't know . They 're suppose to be mythical . Ahhhh . Mythical . There you go . Okay , so it 's ... it 's a distant cousin . Maybe a snow beast . I don 't care if it 's a mutated bear , I really don 't care what it is . We are leaving , all of us , first thing in the morning . Look , we have the video footage . I mean we could use that , right ? Everyone 's happy ? All that video 's going to do is drag everyone down here to make sure it 's not a hoax and steal our discovery right from under our noses . We need more . Jim , this could set us for life . Funding would never be a question again . Marci , we just found a dead guy packed away in a snow cave . I 'm not going to let that happen to anybody else . You 've overreacting . Oh really ? Are you forgetting that whatever this thing is , it was very close to this cabin , right outside that door ? The snowmobile , remember ? You leaving too ? Yes , he 's leaving , you 're leaving , I 'm leaving , she 's leaving , we 're all leaving first thing in the morning . Okay . You two are basing your decision off of fear . This is science . Leave emotion out . You know what ? I am afraid , but there 's nothing wrong with fear . He 's right . Marci , do you know what triggers fear ? It 's basic survival instinct . It 's either fight or flight . We are leaving this cabin , and that is not a decision based on emotion . That is a decision based on survival . Rob . Hey , Rob . Wake up , let 's go . Huh ? Come on ! I 'm coming . Where 'd she go ? Hey Dad ! Marci might be in trouble . Stay at the cabin . We 'll be back as soon as we can . Marci ? Where is she ? Marci ! Jim , Jim , start the truck . What ? Try to start the truck . Yeah . Nothing . Well try again . Nope . Alright . Pop the hood . It 's stuck . Bad to worse . Dad ! What are we going to do ? Keep an eye on the monitors and I 'll go look for Marci . Sweetheart . Dad , she 's dead . We don 't know that for sure , sweetheart . No , I saw her on the cameras . What ? Why did she have to go out there looking for that thing ? She wanted to find what was eating the lynx . He 's eaten everything else around here . We 're all that 's left . Do we have to talk about this . Either way , we 're not safe here . We need to go . Yeah , get your stuff . We 're leaving baby . But the truck won 't start . Then we 'll take the snowmobiles . Come on . There 's only one . We won 't fit . Then you stay here . I 'll take the snowmobile and get help . No , Dad ! No , I 'll go . Emmy , Emmy , you will be here and I 'm not going to take the chance of losing another member of my team . Jim ! Rob , work on the satellite , I can 't do that . Get it working and call town and tell them I 'm on my way . Tranq gun 's gone , but I found some extra darts . You won 't be able to use them from far away . I hope I don 't have to use them at all . Sure I can 't talk you out of this . No , you can 't talk me out of this . All right , well , you got two ways to go . You could follow the road down or go straight through the forest . If I go through the forest , how much time does that save ? Four , maybe five miles . Faster . Take this . Thanks . Dad ? Hey , hey . I 'll be back . Please be careful . I love you too . If anything happens to me , I want you to get her to safety , no matter what . I will . You think he 'll be all right ? Yeah , yeah , he 'll be fine . Come on , come on . Uhhhhh ! Dad ? Jim . Jim ! Dad . Dad , are you there ? Dad , please answer me . What are you doing ? Geez . I 've got to do something . It 's not going to work . If it would have , you and Dad already would have done it . Well there 's no harm in trying . What about my dad ? I 'm not leaving here without him . Emmy , we don 't know he 's alive . We don 't know if he 's dead either . Would you keep it down ? You 're right . He may be alive . You really think so ? Looks like we 'll have to wait it out and see . Wait ? Wait where ? Let 's get back to the cabin . Come on . Grab the first aid kit . It 's in the back . Whoa . It 's just in case . Come on . It 's snowing harder now . We 'll stay here tonight . Hopefully somebody comes to help . And my dad ? We 'll see . I 'm going to go after him . Emmy , no . I 'm going with or without you . No you 're not . You said it yourself , he might be fine . You don 't believe that . We need to try and look for him . Emmy , we can 't just ... This is my father we 're talking about ! And my friend ! Emmy , I understand , I do , but we can 't do anything tonight . It 's not safe , especially when it 's dark . I 'm sorry . Okay , it 's ready . Emmy ? I 'm not hungry . Okay , um , I 'll set a plate aside for later . It 's loud , the wind . Yeah . It gets that way out here . I wonder how much snow we have already . Upstairs . Hurry ! Hurry ! What about you ? Right behind you . Help me with this . Is this going to stop him ? I hope so . Can we jump ? Where do you suggest we go ? Ah ! Ah ! Thanks . What if it 's waiting for us when we go out ? Well , if he is like most predators , it 's more active at night . Hunting . Yeah . What about day ? He seems plenty active then . I guess we 'll find out . I 'm not leaving here till morning . You 're suppose to be all brave and comforting . Why ? So I don 't get scared . Sorry . My dad would try to say something to make this seem all right . No offense , but I really wish he were here . Yeah , me too . What if my dad ... What am I suppose to do when I go home ? What do you mean ? What 's my life suppose to be like now ? I wish I knew . You 'll figure it out . Guess I 'll have to . You know , your dad maybe okay ? Yeah . Do you think he 's still out there ? I don 't see anything . Come on , help me move this . Remember how you said animals can get close to their prey and attack without a sound ? Yeah . Like it never knew he was there . Right . It 's okay . Seriously ? Geez . So much for being safe here . He ate your dinner . Better than eating me . We can 't stay here anymore . How are we going to get out of here . On foot . It 's not going to be safe . We don 't have much of a choice . You know where it 's cave is , right ? Yeah . That 's where my dad would be . I don 't like where this is going . We have to try . Try what ? To go into that thing 's cave and ask him if we can take his next meal ? Emmy , it 's going to be crazy enough just going out there for help . Even away from the cave no one 's chances are good . You said so yourself , my dad might be okay . I was trying to be comforting . You know what I kept thinking about last night ? If my dad was alive and we left him here to die ... If we get out of here , that 's what I 'm going to think about every night for the rest of my life . Rob , please . If we do this , we 're going to need an offence . We have to lure the creature away from his cave without him surprising us . We have to trap him or kill , anything to keep him from coming after us . We 'll use the tranq darts . When he comes after the food , we 'll take him down . Do you think it 'll really work ? In theory . What 's our backup plan ? Run . And hope we can outrun each other . You know , all this food wafting together smells really gross . Yeah , well I hope that thing likes it . Why do I have to carry it ? Cause I got the gun . His cave 's just a few minutes that way . Where are we going to hide so it doesn 't eat us first ? Right there . Thanks for doing this . Yeah , well don 't thank me yet . Even if Dad ... Thanks for trying . Well , I think he 'd be crazy angry with you for doing this , then really touched . He 's my dad . I know . It just seems like things haven 't been the best between you two . He 's trying too hard . Ever thought about giving him a break ? I would , but , he doesn 't listen . My mom walked out on us both . Not just because she didn 't love him , okay , she didn 't care about me either . And I 'm okay with that . He just didn 't get it . I 'm still waiting for him to catch on . Maybe you should . Where 's he coming from ? I don 't know . When are the darts going to kick in ? I don 't know . Crap . He 's heavier than I thought . It 's the last one . How long is it going to last ? I don 't know . You don 't know ? I don 't know . Let 's go . Do you think he 's coming yet ? I don 't know . Come on . Let 's hurry . Marci ? Emmy ? Let 's go find your dad . Jim ! Dad ? Dad , can you hear me ? He 's still alive . Uhh . Emmy , get the warming pads . Here , Dad . These will help warm you up . Marci ? She didn 't make it . And that thing ? I put four darts in it . Slowed it down but I couldn 't stop it . Where is it ? Uhh . Can you walk . I hope I can run . Go ! Go ! Uhh . Ahh ! Marci ? Come on , Dad , we got to go . Ahhhh ! Uhhh . Ahhh ! Come on , Dad . Uhhh . Come on , Dad . Get up , we got to go . We 're not going to make it . Don 't say that , Dad . We 're going to be fine . Come on . If that thing catches up to us , I want you just to keep running and don 't look back . Shut up , Dad ! Emmy , do it ! Come on , hurry ! Emmy . Emmy ! Emmy . Give me that . Get another flare . Give it to me . Let 's go ! Ha , ha . High five . Hey Emmy , how about a sandwich ? Wow . Feels really good to be believed , doesn 't it ? This guy at school was passing around drawings of his own Snow Beast . Really ? How 's the likeness ? Wow . I 'm sorry . No worries . I decked him . Don 't worry , the teacher didn 't see me . Emmy . Do you think anyone will ever believe us ? Honestly sweetheart , if I didn 't see the thing with my own eyes I wouldn 't believe us . I wonder if the body will ever turn up . Come on , slow poke . I 'm not used to hard work . Slacker . What is that ? Ahhhh !

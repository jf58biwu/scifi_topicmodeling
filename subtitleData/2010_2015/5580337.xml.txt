 Julia : Previously on helix ... Late last night , a military listening post received a distress call From a private research base owned by arctic biosystems . The call denoted a possible retroviral outbreak . The third infected patient is peter . ( gagging ) That 's his ex-wife ? He never talks about her or his brother . That 's probably because he caught her and his brother in bed together . We are fairly certain it 's not airborne . Peter , do you know what happened to you ? This thing doesn 't kill , it annihilates . Julia : How did he get out ? This morning he was terminally ill . Now he 's ripping out of restraints ? The people you and I work for aren 't happy , and now I have to clean up your mess . ( wind howling ) Did he infect us ? Are we going to die ? ( alarm blaring ) I 'm not sure what happened . Suddenly , peter , dr . Farragut , was on top of me . ( peter roaring ) He held me down , Put his mouth over mine , like some kind of animal . ( roaring ) I 've never felt so violated . ( sulemani screaming ) I was choking . I couldn 't bloody breathe . Like he was trying to smother me . What about the others ? What others ? There were three more in here with us . After the attack ... They ran . Where ? I don 't know . I need their names . We have a containment issue . I heard . I 've asked hatake for a security team . We 're mounting a search . This place is huge . If we can 't maintain a simple isolation protocol ... There 's nothing simple about this . Alan : All right , let 's concentrate on what we do know . We know the virus is not airborne . What are the victims saying ? They 're saying that peter engaged in some kind of oral contact . What , like a kiss or a bite ? More like an assault . The r-naught of the virus is now six . Multiply that times our escapees ... That 's 18 new cases we can look forward to . We 're not even sure peter 's done yet . Jules , I need you to get started on the rats right away . We need to find out the rate of infection . Sarah , can you handle the isolation unit until doreen checks in ? Yeah , absolutely . Alan : If you see any signs of acute viral syndrome ... Fever , sweats , rash , sore throat , nausea , Vomiting , myalgia , arthralgia , lymphadenopathy ... Any of that . You get back into a racal suit and you find me immediately . Dr. Farragut . Our three missing doctors , Tracey , raver , and deklerk . No one has seen them since they fled the sunroom . Alan : Why does that not surprise me ? Can you tell me , then , if anyone 's tried to leave the base In the last eight hours ? No . Well , then we 'll have to do this the old-fashioned way . Major balleseros and myself will go floor to floor , room by room . And if they refuse to cooperate ? Like your brother ? Let 's not forget he 's still out there . I 'll have to persuade them . Hatake : I hope you can . But just in case , Our security teams will carry stun batons and restraints . You 're going to try to win them over with force ? The safety of this base is my only concern . All right , I don 't agree with restraining people any more than you do , But let 's just find them first , See if we can convince them to do what 's best for the whole base . You 're gonna need my help with those escaped patients . Not as much as I need you in the lab . Rate of infection is secondary to containment . You know that . I 've been tracking infected patients for the past two years . I know how to talk to them . This is not about your qualifications . Then what is it about ? Our lack of resources up here . That 's bullshit . When was the last time you even left atlanta ? Damn it , jules , we cannot both be in charge . You 'll have to follow my lead on this . ( beeps ) ( happy instrumental music playing ) ( squeaking ) ( rats squeaking ) ( thudding ) ( theme music playing ) Sulemani : How long do we have to be in here ? Sarah : A couple of weeks at most . A couple of weeks ? What about my research ? What if I 'm not infected ? I 'm in the same room with them . We 're breathing the same air ... Shut up , bryce . Everybody , please calm down . I know this is very stressful . You don 't know anything . How old are you ? I 'm 26 . You look like you 're 15 . I have two master 's and a phd from mit Specializing in virology and biogenetics . I was the youngest doctor hired by the cdc in over a decade And dr . Farragut put me in charge of isolation because I 'm qualified . Now , I will do my best to address your needs , But I want to make one thing perfectly clear , We will have order here . Balleseros : We 'll start with dr . Tracey 's room . I 'll breach the door and enter first . Don 't follow until you hear the all-clear . What 's that ? Daniel : Stun baton . Use ' em on polar bears . Non-lethal , but they pack a wallop . Ought to come in handy if we run into any bears . If we run into peter farragut , you 'll be glad we have these . He tore off a man 's head . You think a shock is gonna stop him ? You got a better idea ? Yeah , I do . No breaching , no batons . We knock on the door . If dr . Tracey 's home , we have a conversation . And if she 's in no mood to converse ? I 've grown kind of fond of my hands . Alan : Dr. Tracey ? Dr. Tracey , it 's alan farragut with the cdc . These are from the sunroom . She was here . But she didn 't want to be . She was trying to get out . Then where the hell did she go ? ( happy instrumental music playing ) ( happy instrumental music playing ) Who are you ? D ... Doreen boyle . How do I know that 's your real name ? ( stuttering ) it 's on my driver 's license . I got my real weight on there too , but I 'm not telling you that . Who sent you here ? I work for the cdc . I study infectious diseases . Maybe you can help me ... Don 't you come near us ! You hear me ? Us ? Who are you talking to ? You 're messing with my head . I 'm gonna hurt you . You need a doctor . I am a doctor . That 's why I 'm here , to take you to isolation ... No , no , no ! Not there . They do terrible things to you . No , I can 't tell you . They 'll take me to the white room Like dr . Hvit . I want off this base ! You get me on the helicopter . You promise me ? I 'll even get you to sit shotgun . Come on , I 'll go with you ... Why ... Why would you lie to us ? There is no helicopter here . No , not now , but I can make a call . You are a dirty , filthy liar . Now , what are we gonna do with you ? ( distant clanging ) Are you all right ? Yeah . I thought I heard something . I keep thinking about peter up there . It 's just the base settling . Have you slept since you arrived ? Uh , an hour or two . ( sniffs ) I 'm fine , really . Sleep in the arctic is critical . The mind can play tricks . I 'll take that under advisement . Wait . What just happened ? ( rats squeaking ) Did you see that ? Yes . What was going on in that lab ? I told you . Peter was researching mutagens . I think we both know that was no mutagen . What was he really working on ? ( labored breathing ) You 've got to let us out of here . This is kidnapping . I demand to talk to a lawyer ! This is a public health crisis . The cdc has full jurisdiction . Bryce : Oh ! A hell of a lot of good that 's done ! We could do a better job of finding a cure ourselves . Sulemani : Give it a rest , bryce . You give it a rest ! You 're not the one who shared a bathroom with typhoid mary over there . I 'm sorry . Try to keep still . Or what ? I 'll get sick and die ? ( chuckles ) Must be bad , you put the suit back on . We don 't know exactly what we 're dealing with . Everything could be fine . Not knowing is why things can 't be fine . Not knowing is why those two over there Are gonna turn on me . It 's just a matter of time . I 'm not gonna let anything happen to you . I promise . That 's a promise you don 't want to make . ( gasping in pain ) Do you have morphine sulfate here ? He needs morphine now . Where do I get it ? Level g , drug stockroom . ( grunts ) Balleseros : Get up ! Who is it ? One of the runners from the sunroom . He was hiding in the stairwell . Graff : That 's dr . Deklerk from the aerosol division . You didn 't have to be so rough with him . Maybe if you people followed directions . Maybe if you told us what the hell was going on . ( coughing ) What 's wrong with him ? Is he infected ? Uh , we don 't know . What 's his name ? Graff : I told you . Deklerk . His first name ! Uh , henrik , I think . Henrik , we 're with you . We 're with you . We 'll take care of you . He 's still breathing . Get him to sickbay . Daniel : Show 's over . Everyone go back to your rooms . Not until you tell us why we haven 't been evacuated . Man : Keep him away from me . You didn 't answer my question . We 're doing the best we can . That 's bullshit . You 're from the cdc . You could get us out of here if you really wanted to . You know what ? You 're right . You 're right . We could evacuate you all , Airlift you out to the nearest hospital And you know what would happen then ? It would start with the doctors and the nurses , the ones caring for you . They 'd go home to their families , Kiss their kids goodnight and pass on the virus . And the next day at school , some of those kids would infect others , And in two weeks ' time , this virus Is in the general population . In four weeks , Every major city on this planet . So , no , We 're not evacuating you . But we 're not abandoning you . We will stay with you As long as it takes to figure this out . Now , please , Just go back to your rooms . Julia : Nice speech . I haven 't heard that since ... Kikwit , ' 95 ? It was joburg , ' 96 . What are you doing here ? There was something strange going on in peter 's lab . I 've been combing surveillance tape ... I asked you to work on rate of infection . This seemed more important . I thought I made this clear ... What 's going on , alan ? You were always stubborn , but at least you made sense . We talked about this ... Is this about peter ? That 's absurd . Are you punishing me ? Because believe me , I 've punished myself enough for both of us . This is not the time , it 's not the place ... It was never the time or the place ! That was the problem to begin with . Jules . ( gasps ) You 're here for ... What ? You 're here for a reason ! Um ... Yeah , I 'm , uh , I 'm with the cdc . We 're here to help you . No ! Not you . Walker . Got something here . Injection logs for the last three months . Here 's the date that matches the surveillance tape . February 19th . Lot 14 . He injected 0.2ccs of narvik-a . Lot 15 , 0.2ccs of narvik-b . What is that ? I encourage my staff to push the envelope , To try new and untested formulas . Was peter experimenting with this ? Not that I was aware of . Who else worked in this lab with him ? You met both of them yesterday , In body bags . We need to replicate the test , Peter 's research . We can examine the results ourselves . Inject more rats ? And see what happens . I should 've known . They were never gonna use it for something good . Move a few genes here and there , Activate the replication cycle . Bingo , you got yourself the perfect weapon . It wasn 't my fault , right ? How was I supposed to know it was gonna go sideways ? You can 't make a virus and expect it to follow instructions , right ? Don 't play dumb ! You 're not fooling anyone . You knew what you were doing this whole time . I am not taking the fall for this alone , you hear me ? ( tracey roaring furiously ) Ah ! Oh , god ! I 'm sorry . What 's wrong with me ? Sarah ! Are you all right ? Not really . Did he ... Touch you ? Make any kind of contact ? Did he get any secretions on you ? No , I 'm ... I 'm okay . He didn 't attack me . Balleseros : A lot of empty vials and syringes over here . Morphine sulfate . He 's in pain . This is good . Excuse me ? If he has the presence of mind to self-medicate , Then maybe we can talk him into coming back to isolation Before he infects anyone else . I don 't know . He ... He had this look in his eyes . It wasn 't ... It wasn 't quite human . What else did he do ? You mean aside from climbing this cage like spiderman ? He said something . He said , " you 're here for a reason . " Only not me , he said walker . Alan : Jules ? I think he left us a trail to follow . I 'll get a security team . I 'm going with you . Balleseros : Not this time , doc . Things have been getting out of hand and you know we can 't afford to lose you . But I 'll tell you what , though . How about you be my wingman ? Now I know what a tv dinner feels like . I didn 't think you were old enough to remember that one . Die hard ? Sure , saw it in third grade . Tsk . Ouch . You see anything up there yet ? Nada . How do we even know he 's still up here ? If I know peter , he 's still up there . What makes you so sure ? Alan : He used to hide in the attic when we were kids , When our dad was drinking or angry , Which was a lot . Keep the chatter down . We don 't want to scare him away . No offense , but I don 't think he 's the one who 's scared . Will you look up ? I can 't see anything . Balleseros : Join the club . Alan : What was that ? Balleseros : What was what ? Tilt your head up about 20 degrees . Now look left . Balleseros : It 's dark up here . Get it ? Check your six . Make sure he 's not behind you . Balleseros : Holy shit ! Ugh ! Balleseros ! ( peter breathing ) Is he all right ? Daniel : I 'm not sure . Is he infected ? Well , he 's still breathing , none of that black shit on him . His pulse is steady . What happened up there ? Hell if I know . One minute I was alone , the next minute , I 'm getting a face full of your brother . I guess I must have nailed us both with that bug zapper . That stun baton packs 600kv . It should have knocked him out cold . Alan : Seems like a lot of things that should be happening with peter aren 't . Base one . Okay , we 're on our way . Elevator alarm just went off upstairs . Someone 's trying to leave the base . Julia : Narvik-a subjects are decimated , Close to 100 % mortality rate . And narvik-b ? Morbidity at 100 % , But mortality at zero . They 're infected but still alive . It 's been a long time since I did real lab work . Guess you forget how tedious it can be . No , I miss it . The precision , commitment , sacrifice , All leading to the joy of discovery . My mother used to say something just like that . She was also a scientist ? Cellular biologist , yeah . She died when I was very young . I am sorry . What about your father ? ( glass rattles ) ( rats squeaking ) oh , my god . ( haven groaning in pain ) Can 't you make him stop ? Sarah : Morphine isn 't working . If I give him any more , I might kill him . Yeah , maybe that 's not such a bad idea . Nice . I suppose you 'd feel the same way if it was you lying there ? Look , I feel sorry for haven , but those are the breaks . Everybody , please . We just need to be patient . That 's easy for you to say , you 're back inside that suit . This is just a precaution until we figure out a treatment . You 're not figuring out a treatment . In fact , I don 't think you know a damn thing about this virus at all . Haven : Stop it . Stop . We 're all doctors here , right ? Instead of bickering , let 's put our heads together . Yeah , let 's get her to let us out of here . You know I can 't do that . There 's a chance that you could infect others or become violent ... And what if someone gets violent inside this box , huh ? What are we supposed to do then ? Open the door . At least let us go back to our labs . No . ( sarah grunts ) Do what you want , but I 'm not letting you out of here . Then you 're gonna call someone who will . Base one . Okay . We have to go back . Why ? A couple of detainees are demanding to be let loose . They 're holding dr . Jordan . Go . I 'll check outside , Secure the perimeter . System voice : Security teams , confirm level lockdown . Release dr . Jordan at once . Then we can talk . Let us out and she comes with us . No harm done . If you let us go back to our labs , we can help with the virus . Bryce is a hematologist , I 'm a biochemist . You are in isolation for your own safety . More like rats in a box . We 're not gonna die in here . Hatake : We are working on an antiviral therapy . As soon as we run animal trials ... Animal trials could take weeks ! We 're not going to be around that long , and you know it . Hatake : Dr. Farragut . I need you to let dr . Jordan go . Uh-uh ! Don 't come any closer ! Look , we 're working as hard as we can to figure this thing out And we won 't stop until we do . We both know that 's a crock of shit . Hear him out , bryce . Listen , I 'm in here with you , not out there . We will work this out . All right ? Just give me the syringe And let dr . Jordan go . Why should we trust you ? Dr. Farragut . Alan : Now we 're in this together . Alan , what you did back there ... Thank you . I was just doing my job . And so were you by not letting them leave . I had a good teacher . Yeah ? Do I know him ? It 's low risk anyway , What with the lack of airborne transmission . Jules , what is it ? I need to show you something . The narvik-a subjects died horribly , Lesions , hemorrhagic shock , Liquification of internal organs . But the narvik-b subjects didn 't die . They became Highly aggressive , agitated . Sarah : Sounds like a lyssavirus . Maybe some form of rabies ? Rabies doesn 't include a compulsion to spread the contagion . I 've never seen a pathogen with such focused behavioral patterns . The b samples are acting just like vectors . Vectors on steroids . I think the b virus rewires the brain To create a perfect contagion machine . Like peter . Dr. Farragut , dr . Hatake would like a word with you . And I 'd like a word with him . Get down to isolation . Check on the infected patients . If what you 've discovered is true , We 're not just dealing with a single virus anymore . ( engine sputtering ) Balleseros : Going for a spin ? It 's a brisk night . I hope you brought your woolies . This doesn 't have anything to do with you . Still , I 'm gonna have to ask you to return back to the base . If you had any idea what they were doing here , You 'd be getting the hell out yourself . The transgenic experiments , the virus vaults ... Unregulated research sounds great until you 're actually doing it . What they did to those monkeys was ... Was an abomination . Come back inside . I want to hear about this . I 'm not going back . Just come back inside . You 're gonna freeze out here . People have to know what 's going on up here . We have to tell the newspapers . Hell , we have to tell everyone . ( groaning ) You okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . You don 't have to go back in there right now . I can handle it . I 'm good , thanks . ( door opening ) A little help ? Meet dr . Tracey . She 's in the advanced stages , but I got her tranqued up on monkey juice . Took me a long damn time to haul her ass up here . And there 's some other monkey business I think dr . Farragut would like to hear about . You 're not bringing her in here , are you ? She 's going straight into the icu chamber . You won 't have any contact . A little late for that , isn 't it ? ( haven grunting in pain ) He 's seizing ! I need a crash cart ! Got it . Do it now . Ah ! Bryce : Come on , let 's get out of here ! Sorry , love . This virus was less of a danger before the cdc arrived . Alan : My people were the ones attacked in there . Yours were doing the attacking . I thought you had that situation under control . I was mistaken . And I thought we had the full picture , Not to mention complete access . Maybe you can tell me how it is that patients here just go missing , Or how a member of my team is attacked by an infected monkey She was told didn 't exist in the first place . Or maybe you 'd like to tell me why My brother was tinkering With maybe the worst contagion this world has seen in his own damn lab ? You should ask your brother . I would never encourage something so reckless . First things first , How do we contain the infected patients ? We don 't , not without complete transparency . And if I refuse ? We came here to help . You no longer want that help ? That 's fine . But it seems to me we 're the last chance you have . So , maybe we give each other what we want , what we need ... And just maybe we all get out of here alive . ( shuddering ) I 'm sorry . For what ? It 's not your fault . I should 've been there . Ah , don 't beat yourself up . We 'll get them back . I didn 't keep you off the search because of peter . I didn 't want to ... I lost you once . I appreciate that , I do . But I 'm not your responsibility anymore . You can 't keep trying to protect me . I don 't know that I can stop . ( door opening ) ( door closing ) ( happy instrumental music playing ) Julia . Peter . Ah ! No . No ! No ! No ! Please ! Peter ! Please ! ( screaming )

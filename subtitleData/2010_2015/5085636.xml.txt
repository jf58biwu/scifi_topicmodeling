 The names and faces may change . But no matter how you * * * , war is war . You pick a side and you don 't look back . And believe that now * * * believe that then . When you get in trouble , * * * forget what you 're fighting for you 're finished . [ People screaming ] [ Automatic gunfire ] Yet another entity has emerged ... This time , in the heart of Paris . Authorities are vastly unprepared . Unless a decisive response to this pandemic is marshaled , the city will fall just as Kiev Aaaaah ! Aah ! Aaaaaaaaah ! [ Roars ] [ People screaming ] [ Truck horn blares ] [ Engine turns off ] [ Machine whirs ] Aah ! [ Gasps ] White knight : Save some for me , partner . How else am I gonna earn my paycheck ? All : Surprise ! [ Party horn blowing ] Rex : So , the flu shots ? Dr. Holiday : I needed an excuse to get you here . We 'll do them after cake . ♪ So make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way ♪ ♪ we 're gonna have fun tonight ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ ♪ so make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ Dr. Holiday : I 'll get you , Van Kleiss . [ Laughs ] [ Grunting ] Bobo : Whoa ! Rex : Sorry , doc . It was taking too long . It was either that or throw some of your cake at it . [ Clanking ] [ Indistinct conversations ] Bobo : [ Slurps ] Dr. Holiday : You 're looking festive . Six : It was an odd choice to pick today to be his birthday . Dr. Holiday : It is the anniversary of his new life here . He deserves a celebration . He 's changed everything . Rex : Whoo-hoo ! [ Party horn blows ] Six : Has he ? Rex : Ha ha ! How about hitting the petting zoo for a little " pin the tail on a raging rhinocesaurus " ? Both : No . Rex : Every party has a pooper , and I got two . Both : Happy Birthday ! Rex : Dudes ! Dr. Holiday : You should be celebrating , too , Six . After all , you 're the one who started this . In a way , it 's your birthday , too . [ Machinery whirring , clanking ] [ Roars ] [ Electricity crackling , monsters screeching ] White knight : [ Whistling ] Nyquist , fortier , how 's the monkey business ? Ha-ha-larious , knight . Hey , for your information , we probably saved the world today . White knight : I , for one , feel safer already . Bobo : So , green man , we meet again . They found him at the Kremlin this time . He was threatening to push the button unless someone brought him 1,000 pounds of caviar . Bobo : Chimps gotta eat . What about your little bug hunt ? Give you much trouble ? White knight : Nothing we couldn 't handle . [ Screeching ] White knight : What ? Not even a smile ? Oh , by the way , Happy Birthday . Six : How did you know ? White knight : I 'm your partner . You can 't keep much from me . Six : Thanks . - White knight : So , what crawled up your coat ? - Six : I 'm getting tired of all this fighting . Did you see how many there are now ? Are we gonna cage the whole world ? White knight : We 're preserving the human race . Besides , who says we 're gonna cage them all ? [ Beeping ] [ Machinery whirs , clanks ] [ Screeches ] Dr. Fell : And to think ... This was once spinning webs in someone 's garden . Dr. Holiday , prepare for disassembly . [ Keyboard clacks ] [ Machinery whirs , electricity crackles ] Dr. Holiday : It 's the same exact data as last time . And the time before that . Dr. Fell , why aren 't we studying them in a natural setting ? Dr. Fell : Only through molecular dissection will we find a way to expunge this threat . The committee agrees with me on this . If you do not approve , I can always find a new assistant . White knight : Bleeding hearts ... They 'll get us all killed one day . Dr. Holiday : [ Gasps ] Six : " Evo " ? Dr. Holiday : " Exponentially variegated organism . " A little more scientific than " spoiled meat . " That is what you hired guns call them , isn 't it ? Six : It 's " Six . " And I don 't use guns . You told Fell we could learn more by keeping them alive . What did you mean ? Dr. Holiday : The nanites are altering our DNA , but with the right type of research , there is no reason that they couldn 't be programmed to stop or reverse the process . Imagine a third alternative to this insane " kill or contain " protocol . Six : A third option ? Dr. Holiday : A cure . [ Alarm blaring , radio chatter ] White knight : Buckle up , partner . Looks like we got ourselves a big one . Dr. Holiday : [ Scoffs ] Hopeless . [ Automatic gunfire ] [ Tires screech ] White knight : What are we looking at ? Dr. Fell : Fascinating . It appears to be biomechanical . I must have a closer look at this one . White knight : One for the trophy case . [ Tires screech ] Six : Wait ! We may get more out of this one if we bring it in alive . White knight : Are you nuts ? ! Looks like your boy is losing his edge , knight . White knight : Not a cage in the world that could hold this thing . [ Tires screeching , explosions ] Six ? [ Electricity crackles ] That 's more like it ! Six : White ! Get back ! This thing 's going to blow ! [ Grunts ] [ Coughs ] [ Crash ] Knight ? Knight ! Rex : Help ! ¿ Has visto mi bicicleta ? Rex : Is that sword for real ? Are you a ninja ? I was speaking Spanish . Is this Mexico ? Why are we sneaking around ... [ growling in distance ] [ Muffled ] Aw , dude , your hand smells like monkey breath . [ Panting in distance ] Why don 't you just call h.Q. Or NORAD or 911 ? Six : When the creature blew , it released some sort of e.M. Pulse fried everything electronic . This area is a dead zone . We 're on our own . Rex : So much for ordering a pizza . I 'm joking , ' cause if I don 't , I 'm gonna remember how scared I am right now . [ Screech in distance ] Actually , except for my name , that 's about all I do remember . Six : No family ? An address ? A grandma where I can dump you ? Rex : Nothing . Except waking up and seeing your face . Not exactly the angel I was hoping for . Six : You 're in shock . We should find a place to hole you up until I can get some help . Rex : No way ! I 'm not hiding ! Why ? You want to get rid of me ? Six : I screwed up , and it may very well have caused my friend his life . The last thing I need is you slowing me down . No . Rex : What 's going on ? What did this ? Six : Don 't worry . W-we evacuated this zone . We 'll get you home . I promise . [ Howl in distance ] Right now , we got to move . Rex : What 's making those sounds ? Huh ? [ Roars ] Six : New plan ... Run ! [ Growls ] Six : Ugh ! [ Panting ] Rex : Aah ! Leave him alone ! [ Groans ] [ Groans ] Rex : Oh , great . I probably got rabies . What ? White knight : Glad to see you alive , partner . Six : Happy to accommodate . White knight : Better stand clear of Fell . He 's furious we didn 't bring back a sample of that monster . Rex : Uh , no . I don 't know where they keep the jet planes . Bobo : Whoa ! Aah ! Ugh ! - Six : Why 'd you let him out ? - Rex : He asked me to . I don 't know if you guys are aware of this , but that monkey talks . White knight : Who are you ? What are you doing in here ? Six : He 's with me . I found him out in the field . There 's something I wanted to show ... [ machinery whirs , electricity crackles ] ... Dr. Holiday . Rex : Ouch ! Ah ! Let me see your medical license . Dr. Holiday : Six , we have nurses who could have easily handled this . What are you doing ? That evo is scheduled for processing . [ Growls ] Six : Show her . We found it , doctor ... the third alternative . Dr. Holiday : What is he ... How ... Six : Meet Rex ... the cure . Dr. Holiday : [ Gasps ] This changes everything ! Six : Finally asleep ? Dr. Holiday : Amazing what 15 burritos will do . I can 't wait to see Fell 's face when we show him . Six : No . Not a word to anyone . Tomorrow , we move him to a safe location . Dr. Holiday : But ... I need to get to woron him straightaway . Six : Trust me ... not everyone will feel the same way about working with an evo . If we time this wrong , it could turn ugly . Dr. Holiday : [ Sighs ] I hate this war . White knight : Hey , partner . How 's tricks ? Six : What are you doing in the medical ward ? I thought you hated germs . White knight : Made an exception today . Something I should know ? Six : Just another day at the office . - White knight : You can trust me . - Six : I know . [ Wood clatters ] [ Machinery whirring , electricity crackling ] Holiday , is Fell running protocols at night now ? Holiday ? [ Beeping ] - Dr. Fell : Prepare for disassembly . - Six : What are you doing ? ! White knight : I 'm not going to allow my partner to risk his career for one bad call . Rex : [ Groans ] White knight : Did you think I couldn 't get Holiday to talk ? Dr. Fell : You 're letting your emotions cloud your judgment , Six . With what we glean from this boy , I could create tools that would inoculate the world . Six : Why risk it ? He can already cure them . I 've seen it . White knight : So , what ? We train him ? Make him one of us ? I thought he was sedated ! Dr. Fell : He is . It 's his nanites . They 're protecting him . Aaaah ! Rex : [ Grunting ] White knight : One of us , huh ? [ Alarm blaring ] [ Machinery whirs , electricity crackles ] Rex : Aaah ! Aaaah ! [ Electricity crackling ] [ Rumbling ] Okay , this is definitely not normal . White knight : Enough of this . Have you lost it ? ! He 's one of them ! If he powers up , he 'll destroy us all ! Six : No ! White knight : So , that 's it , huh ? Dr. Holiday : You cannot treat me like this ! I have three PhD 's ! Let me out this instant ! Bobo : You know , maybe we can scratch each other 's backs . [ Clicking ] Dr. Holiday : Excuse me ? Bobo : Right between the shoulder blades . And watch the nails . You thought I was kidding about the back scratch ? I got monkey dander ! [ Electricity crackling ] Rex : Aaah ! [ Automatic gunfire ] White knight : Stand down , Six ! We need you in this war ! Six : What 's the good in winning a war if we can 't live with ourselves after ? [ Both grunting ] [ Electricity crackling ] White knight : We 're supposed to be friends . He 's a monster . What do you see in him ? Rex : [ Moaning ] Six : Hope . [ Both grunting ] [ Gun fires ] [ Gasps ] Ugh . White knight : Thanks for talking some sense into him , doc . [ Electricity crackling ] Rex : W-what 's happening to me ? [ Alarm blaring ] [ Moaning ] Dr. Fell : We 're all going to burn . [ Beeping ] White knight : [ Grunts ] No ! [ Grunts ] Six : Why ? White knight : I know what side I 'm on . Aaaaah ! Six : Do something ! Dr. Fell : Once the cycle starts , it 's impossible to shut down . [ Crackling fades ] Rex : Impossible ? Pshh ! Right ! - Dr. Holiday : How did you ... - Rex : Told it to turn off . And it did . Wait . Where ... where am I ? Dr. Fell : Dr. Holiday ... Maybe you were right . Dr. Holiday : Maybe you should start looking for another job . White knight : [ Sighs ] Bobo : Hey , marshmallow , nice look . White knight : How 's the training ? Six : Slow . White knight : Not all you hoped he 'd be ? Rex and Bobo : [ Grunting ] White knight : Still , who would have thought the kinder , gentler approach would do such wonders for our profile ? The notion of a cure has gotten Providence funding and worldwide prestige . The committee 's happy . Your new partner may just be the best thing this operation could have asked for . Funny , isn 't it ? Because of you , I can never leave this chamber . I 'm now the only pure human left in the world ... And the perfect poster boy to run this operation . I suppose I should thank you . Six : I promised him that we would help uncover his past , find his family . White knight : Whatever keeps him on his leash . But if he shows the slightest sign of turning into that thing again ... It 's all on you . Rex : [ Laughs ] Oh , my . H-hold him down . I 'll get the camera . Six : Happy Birthday . Rex : From you ? For me ? You got to be kidding . Six : You , your work ... It has made a real difference . - I just ... - Rex : Yeah , I know I 'm pretty great . But , seriously , get off the sap train , Six . It 's creeping me out . Wow ! Six ... Thank you . Six : It 's called a tanto . It 's the ceremonial blade of a samurai warrior . Rex : Samurai ? Awesome . Six : This is its twin . Rex : Is that ... writing ? Six : Bushido symbol of loyalty . It means " whether for good or ill , our fates will follow the same path . " This one stays with me . Rex : Think this thing can cut through Holiday 's chocolate cake ? Six : Anything 's possible .

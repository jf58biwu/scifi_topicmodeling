 We are going to survive . We are going to make it home . I 'm telling you , the ship came here for a reason . Destiny is powered by the stars themselves . He and Young are bumping heads , yes . Not sure which camp is the better choice . We just pretend nothing happened . We need to be ready for the next encounter . For the sake of the crew . For the sake of the crew . I 'm not sick . What about the father ? This is unlike any other kind Of alien technology we 've encountered before . If they 're indigenous to this part of the universe , They might be willing to trade . You lost the kino ? No , I took a wrong turn trying to steer it out . I just need to take a look and get my bearings . We haven 't found any other sort of exit , Or access to ground level . We 're not going to make it . Fire in the hole ! Doesn 't look like that had the desired effect . We just made things a lot worse . God be with you , Colonel . Riley ... I think Eli would want someone Documenting the efforts To rescue the team That was left behind . Well , given that Eli is one of the team That was left behind , I would have thought He 'd want everyone doing anything possible To help rescue them . Well , you didn 't like my idea . Telling Destiny to go back and pick them up Isn 't going to work . How do you know ? Because I 've already tried it ! I 'm done . The stargate aboard this ship is much more primitive Than the later models found in the milky way . As you can see from this map , each time Destiny stops , It 's in range of only a small group of gates . That means the next time we drop out of FTL , The planet the team was stranded on Will no longer be in range of Destiny . However , Dr. Rush and Mr. Brody are working on ... That 's weird . What happened ? Well , the battery must have died . Okay . I just got this one fresh out of the dispenser . It wasn 't me . I am not the sort of person Who just jumps into bed with anyone . I had thought we ... Colonel Young asked you to check on me , didn 't he ? Yes , but he 's asking me to keep tabs on everybody . He believes in you . Well , he doesn 't have much choice . I 'm also here because I 'm your friend . I 'm sorry , it 's just that ... Rush , come in . Yeah , we 've got several systems down . Looks like Destiny 's activated some kind of power-saving mode . That 's strange , because our reserves are still At almost maximum current capacity From the last recharge . Life support 's fine . I should be able to work round it , Get the lights back on in a couple of minutes . Maybe we shouldn 't . What ? Work around it . I mean , there 's got to be a good reason this is happening . This whole ship is falling apart . Computers don 't last forever . Maybe it 's a malfunction . Well , we 're not going to be able to do anything In the dark . We have two days of water , tops . We 'll find more . Step one , We get out of these tunnels . We 're off to a bad start . We 'll find food and water . They can 't turn the ship around . Then we 'll use the gates to catch up . In order to connect the dots between here and the Destiny , There have to be gates in range of each other Between this planet and wherever Destiny stops next . Plus , this remote only tells you Which gates are in range of this planet , Not where they are . There 's no way to know which direction we 'd be going . Oh , and in case that 's not bad enough , We have no idea Where Destiny went . Whoa , one step at a time . Yeah , let 's all try and keep a positive attitude . C4 blast could have destabilized the whole place . Oh , that 's just great . We had to take the risk . We 're seriously ... Eli . All we can do right now is keep moving . Son of a ... So , what do we know ? Not much . Several nonessential systems Automatically shut down . We still only have limited control . How about rescuing the team we left behind ? As I 've said , Colonel , We won 't know if the planet they were left on is reachable Until we 've dropped out of FTL . This is crazy . You 'd think some of these tunnels Would lead somewhere . No wonder the people that built this place died out . They probably all got lost down here . Just wandered around thinking , " if only we had thought to put in a few more exits . " Or how about one of those maps you see in a shopping mall With a big red dot . " you are here . " How hard is that ? I 'd kill for a big red dot right now . I can 't take this anymore . All right , let 's stop , take a quick breather . Five minutes . Thank God ! Still looking for that kino ? Uh , no . So what are you doing ? I 've been thinking about using the gates , actually . And ? I may have painted an overly bleak picture before . I 'll admit , I was freaking out a bit . And now ? Well , we do know That Destiny is traveling down a path , Basically a corridor of gates Left behind by the ships that were sent in advance . It meanders somewhat , But generally , it heads in one direction . I mean , they wouldn 't put gates on every planet in every galaxy . Obviously not . People don 't realize How big a galaxy is . Anyway ... Let 's say the gates in range of the planet we 're on Are in this circle . This circle represents The gates in range of Destiny The next time it drops out of FTL . Okay , so we need to get to that circle . Yeah , right . Now , hopefully , there are gates in range of each other Between these circles . Once we are in range of Destiny , The address will show up on here . You see how easy it is to make a simple map ? Okay , so how do we know we 're going the right way ? We don 't , But if we do go the wrong way , We 'll either run out of addresses Because we 've hit the edge of the corridor , Or we 'll run into planets we 've been to before Or at least addresses I 'll hopefully remember or recognize , but ... At least it 's a 50-50 shot . Good . All right , we should really get moving . Why ? It hasn 't been five minutes . Eli , seriously ! Are you seeing what I 'm seeing ? Yeah . Well , I suspected as much . Well , if it 's true ... I know . You 're not going to tell Young ? Well , it 's not certain . You have to tell him . She 's upset . We all are . But she 's fine , though ? I mean , I don 't have to worry About putting her back out there ? No . A few words of encouragement from you Wouldn 't hurt , though . She thinks you don 't have any confidence in her , That you 're only putting her out there Because you don 't have a choice ... I don 't . I know you think she 's a good soldier . Is she aware that I know About her previous relationship with Scott ? No . She 's not over him , either , But that 's not an issue . Thanks . Sir ... There 's something else I ... Need to tell you . Well , that sounds serious . Colonel Young , come in . Rush , go ahead . You 're going to want to see this . I 'll be right there . So , you were going to say ? It can wait . It 's more of a longer conversation . Okay . When I was left behind on that planet With the crashed alien ship ... I remember . One of the things I saw there Appeared to be a map of this galaxy , Including the stargates . And ? Well , Mr. Brody and myself have been working on our own map , Based on our own records Of where Destiny has been thus far . I thought Destiny had a map of where it 's been . Yeah , but trying to create a clearer picture Of the entire galaxy we 're in ... Rush , just cut to the chase , will you ? I was hoping to have some better news , But if I 'm right ... Then we are at the very edge of this galaxy . Now , how is that bad news ? We know that Destiny travels between galaxies . Yeah , but the space between galaxies is huge . Vast , empty . You think that 's why that power-saving protocol kicked in ? I don 't know , it could be , But more importantly , there will be no more gates . No chance of dialing back to this system . If we don 't find them The next time we drop out of FTL ... We won 't have another chance . Oh , my God ! What ? The kino . Look , look , an exit ! The kino found an exit . That 's awesome . Where 's the kino ? I have no idea . Right . Exactly . Come on , at least now we know That there is a way out of here . Left or right ? What 's it going to be ? We 're traveling blind , So what difference does it make ? Left . I like left . No offence to what you like , man , but ... No . He 's right . We should go left . How do you know for sure ? Because that 's what this map says . There 's been a few of these along the way . I thought they were just decorative at first . So far they 've been the same except for one thing . This symbol seems to be in different places . " you are here . " There have been maps down here this whole time ? That 's awesome . Are you sure ? Well , this seems to be the fork we 're standing at . Yeah , well , there 's only one way to find out . What are you doing ? Going to go look for another one . Greer ! Greer ! She 's right . There 's another map ... Greer ! I tried . I did , really ! I was about to tell him , And then he got called away by Rush . Well , you should have told him anyway . It just , it sounded important . So is this . I know . He 's going to find out soon enough . I mean , you 're starting to show . I know . Are you afraid of what he 's going to say ? Or not say , I don 't know . Go tell him right now . It just seems like there 's always something . Matt ! I 'm fine . Oh , my God . Greer ! Greer ! Come in , Greer ! Ron , can you hear me ? Maybe the signal can 't penetrate the rocks . We could hear James pretty clearly . Three hours . Besides dialing , Checking for safe environment , Roughly eight to ten minutes per planet . Factor in time to get back , We 'll be able to see roughly 20 planets . At least we know the direction to go in . We 'll find them , sir . Good luck . Colonel , it 's TJ , come in ? Go ahead . Have they left ? Yes . Unfortunately , it 's a very short window . Do you have some time to talk in private ? I 'm just on my way to see to Dr. Volker , Talk about the charging plates , putting them back online . Nothing seems to be working around here . Can it wait ? Greer ! Come on , buddy ! Greer ! Ow , wait , wait , wait ! All right , stop , stop , stop ! Stop moving rocks . We need to get out of here . Look , I saw those rocks coming down . It ... I know he would want us to get out of here alive , Especially if there was no hope for him . Are you just saying that Because you think you need to get us out of here ? Gear up . Give me a second here . Just ... Go . Look , Greer ? I 'm sorry , man . Go ! Move , move , move , this thing 's coming down . Please . The boy has to eat . Look , don 't you go near there . You got to let him out . I don 't got to do nothing ! Mom ? The boy has to learn . Hello ! Hey , you guys , can anybody hear me ? I 'm here ! Scott , this is Greer , come in . Come in ... Hey , at least the tremors have stopped . Probably got far enough from the cave-in . I 'll go . Done . Done . He wasn 't always like this . You say that all the time . He was a good man , A good father . You were too young to remember . I hate him . It 's not his fault . Don 't care . You need to be strong . I know you got it in you . He needs us , both of us . Nobody else is going to take care of him . We need to go . Where ? Far away . Both of us . We need to get out of here . Eli , hold up a second . What ? I 'm saying maybe the thing to do is stay put . If it is possible to connect the dots Between here and Destiny , Then Colonel Young is going to send a team Back to look for us . Maybe we 'd be better off Waiting for them to find us . We don 't know how long Destiny is going to stop for . If it 's a short window , There might not be enough time for them to get here , And then to gate back to Destiny ? We need to take the chance . Okay , dial it . It 's hard to see . Looks pretty foggy , But everything else is good . It 's safe to go . Get out . Get out . I don 't have any money . Probably a good thing down here . Matt ? It 'll take a minute For the gate list to refresh . If Destiny 's in FTL , it won 't show up , right ? Right . So shouldn 't we be spending A little more time on these planets ? Waiting to see if it does ? What if it is out of FTL , But just one planet away from here ? See , I knew this was a bad idea . Weren 't you the one who said We should stop being so negative ? 10 minutes . We give each planet ... You hear that ? Of course we heard it . Dial the gate . I 'm dialing . Dial faster . I 'm dialing , I 'm dialing ! Eli ! Holy ... Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom , we have to go ! Mom , wake up ! You should 've let me burn . It 's beautiful . Not that I 'd want to be stuck here For a long time , But it is an incredible sight to see . Yes . This is our tenth planet . We have less than an hour and a half left . This is a lot more complicated than I 'd anticipated . Who would have guessed That Destiny had skipped over so many planets With gates on them ? Getting back should be much quicker , though . Yes . Well , we have extra kinos and a remote . Maybe it 's time to split up , cover more planets . Agreed . We 're going to find them . We just need a bit of luck . I 'm afraid I don 't believe in that . So you 'll take one team and I 'll take the other ? The fires ... The fires were everywhere . That oil burned hot . Got so we forgot What a clean breath of air felt like . Emphysema , asthma , bronchitis . They said none of the guys sent in to put out the fires Showed any ill effects . Come on , you buy that ? How can that be true ? Those fires were everywhere ... The man 's a living hell . Sent by the devil himself to torture me for all eternity . Just a little skin reaction , they said . Just a little itchy on the arm . The FDA approved it Even though it 'd never been through Any serious large-scale trials . There were no side effects . They said it was the war , Not the vaccine . Between 1998 and 2000 , 20,000 soldiers had to be hospitalized After receiving the vaccine Even though they had never been deployed overseas . The pentagon failed to report that to congress ! Wasn 't as bad as the sand fleas , though . They got under your skin and how . Carried all kinds of diseases . Diseases you can 't even say . Tank busters . Uranium depleted . I loaded those munitions . Nothing dangerous coming off those . What do you think ? 18,000 times in two years those alarms went off . It 's not the mustard gas , never the mustard gas ! It was cigarettes . Deodorant ! Can you believe that ? Chronic fatigue , loss of muscle control , Headaches , dizziness , memory loss , Shortness of breath , brain cancer ... I 'm going to kill him . Put him out of his misery . It was the war . It was the war ! It wasn 't the fires . They were everywhere . Big black billowing smoke . The war is why he can 't breathe . Hey , TJ ! Listen , I 'm sorry . One thing turned into another , And the next thing I know , a five-minute update is ... I 'm pregnant . You 're pregnant ? How far along are you ? About 22 weeks . It 's yours . Ours . A baby . On this ship ... I 'm keeping it . No , I didn 't ... I didn 't say you shouldn 't . What are you saying ? We 're going to ... we 're going to make this work . We 're going to do it , we 're going to make it work . Okay ? This is a problem . What ? The kino says The atmosphere on the planet we just sent it to is toxic . We can 't go through . Which means we can 't get that kino back . And we won 't know if the next address we try Is safe . Dial another one . But I just said that ... I know , I know , But we can 't stay here , can we ? No , no , but I ... You stay , I 'll go , I 'll go . I 'll radio back if it 's safe . Matt , no . Look , we stay here , We 're as good as dead anyway . Dial another one . They left you . Abandoned you . They did whathey had to do . They thought I was dead . Nobody 's going to save you . Nobody cares . In the end , all there is is you . You alone . Doctor says There 's an infection in his brain . They say there 's nothing they can do for him . I enlisted . What 'd you go and do that for ? I didn 't get the scholarship . But you worked so hard . Wasn 't fast enough . You always said it wasn 't his fault . His choice wasn 't wrong . He just wanted to be somebody . I want to be somebody . You don 't have anything to prove to anyone . You didn 't let him change you . Nothing can hurt the spirit God gave you ... I have to use it . Don 't I ? To make a difference . You can still change your mind . I 'm not going to . All right , I 'm okay . It 's cold and dark , But I can breathe , And there 's no crazy dinosaurs , At least not yet . Come on through . It 's kind of pretty . Sometimes we would spend christmas At a cabin in Vermont . Amazing ... That a planet on the other side of the universe Can remind you of Vermont . Okay . Here we go , The next set of addresses . Oh , God ... What ? I recognize this one . One we 've been to before ? Not recently . That 's not good . It 's the one with the downed alien ship . The ... The planet Rush was stranded on . We 've been heading the wrong way . Okay , so what now ? Can we retrace our steps ? Wait ... No . We should go to this planet . Why ? Look , even if we retrace our steps And try this all again with different choices , We 're traveling blind . Rush said he we was able to boot up the computer On that alien ship . Yea , and that 's what brought the aliens . Yes , but in the small time that he was there , He was able to glean some information About the shape of this galaxy And where the stargates are . If I can do the same , We won 't have to stumble around . We 'd have a map . Okay , but what about the aliens ? Believe me , you do not want to end up a prisoner On one of those ships . I realize we might not have much time . We 'll have to get in and out quickly . If they 're not there now . Lieutenant . I hope this is a good idea . All right , come on . Hey , Eli ? How about this ? Guess we 're in the right place . Well , I didn 't see any other alien spaceships , Did you ? Come on , clock is ticking . I know , I know . 15 minutes . Where 'd you get that number ? I like it . This is an alien spaceship . Right , exactly . 15 minutes , that is it . End of discussion . Nice work , Lieutenant . Thank you , sir . Any word from Rush ? Not yet . I 'm glad you made it back . Yes , sir . Sergeant ? They thought I was dead . I don 't think they would have left me otherwise . I just hope that choice doesn 't mean we 've lost them . None of this makes any sense . Okay , time 's up , we need to walk away . Not yet . Wait . You just said none of this makes any sense ... I know . I know . Eli ... Go back . What do you mean ? The screens , go back . There ! Select that . There it is . How did you know that ? I don 't know . Can you read this ? No , I just ... Know what it means ? Look , can you use this To get us back to Destiny or not ? Uh ... Yes ? Yes . I think so . We have to hurry , though . Why ? If I 'm reading this right , Then Destiny is about to leave the galaxy . If we don 't get back on board before it does , We 're going to be stranded for good . Game over . Five minutes . Okay ... Seriously , there was no quicker way ? No . If I 'm right , this planet should be just ... There it is ! Destiny ! Dial , dial , dial ! Okay . Down to the wire . Incoming wormhole . You cut it close . Greer . And the others were not with him . What happened ? I don 't know . It didn 't connect . Why not ? I don 't know ! So where are they ? Dial it again . Dial it again ! Yeah , yeah , okay . What happened ? I said I don 't ... Oh , God ! What ? The address just disappeared . How can it be there one second And gone the next ? They jumped . We missed it . We must have just ... Missed it . That 's it . We 're done . I 'm trying to carry on for Eli . Don 't you think he 'd want me to ? I mean , I think it 's important . Look , I know you 've been through a lot . I only need a minute or two . What happened on the planet ? People are going to want to hear your story , You know . Maybe another time . . : Napisy24 - Nowy Wymiar Napisów : . Napisy24.pl

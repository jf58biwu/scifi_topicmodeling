 This is what Destiny intended from the moment it entered the star system . That ship is the best chance we have of getting home . Are we done ? We 'll never be done . You shouldn 't have left him on the planet . You think I don 't know that ? Everyone thinks we 're safe . They think that they 'll never find us again . Why did you take one of our people prisoner ? We 're not safe , are we ? They 're coming . Who 's coming ? The Lucian alliance , they 're coming to take Destiny . There 's only one way this is gonna end if we wait . I 'm not surrendering this ship . This planet was created for us . We were led here for a reason . Some of the people have decided That they would like to stay behind on the planet . Colonel Telford admitted to being a mole For the Lucian alliance . We 're going to have to do this the hard way . I 'm going to save every one of those hostages , And I 'm going to retake this ship . What happened ? You were shot . There 's no countdown . We dropped out of ftl because someone was gating in . Why haven 't we jumped back ? The Destiny came out of ftl Within range of a pulsar . We don 't have much time before the shield fails . Someone 's going to have to go for a walk . It should buy us enough time to restore ftl capability . Transfer control of the ship and surrender yourselves . They 'll herd all of the prisoners Into one compartment . I 'll access one of the gate room consoles And transfer control of the ship back to Rush . Kiva and Telford have both been shot . Shield is still up ! We cannot get back inside ! I need you to head back towards the front of the ship . That 's the way in . I 'm getting a message . I gotta go ! Beautiful , isn 't she ? Caine ? It 's good to see you again , T.J. What ... What is this ? Where am I ? How did I get here ? I know it 's a lot to process right now , So just take your time , okay ? We left you on that planet , and we left the galaxy . You can 't be surprised That aliens who built a solar system Are capable of a little intergalactic transport . Are you saying they brought me here ? Well , you 're here , right ? So this is ... Your baby , of course . You don 't have to worry anymore , T.J. She 's safe now . We 're getting a message . It 's Eli . They didn 't make it . There just wasn 't enough time . This is Scott ! Come in , please ! Lieutenant , where are you ? Well , we 're still outside . I had a hunch We weren 't going to make it to the airlock in time , So we made a beeline for the underside of the ship . I 'm guessing the hull protected us . I guess it did . Well , the radiation spike has passed . You should be safe to make it to the airlock now . Roger that . We 're on our way . Just another day in outer space . Dannic ! The military personnel are a liability . Kiva 's still alive . The medic 's been injured . She was shot . She was military as well . It was a mistake to trust her . You son of a ... son of a ... I want him dead ! Dannic , listen to me ! Listen to me ! We need their cooperation . We can use the communication stones To get a team of doctors onboard . We can 't spare the men . We can use some of them . It doesn 't matter what they report back . There 's nothing anyone on earth can do about this . All right , But if Kiva dies , they all die . Thank God ! I thought you two were fried for sure . No , we 're fine . I 'd say we 're anything but fine . You 'd rather be back out there ? Eli ? Chloe ? Hey , what happened ? She was shot in the leg . I 'm okay , I 'm okay . How are you even walking right now ? 10 minutes ago , you were almost passed out . I don 't know , the bleeding stopped . I got my strength back . What ? She 's right . The bleeding 's stopped . Are you sure you 're okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Everybody 's fine . So ? What do we do now ? Who are you ? I 'm Dr. Brightman . This is Dr. Ziegler , Dr. Finch , And Dr. Tyman . All right , follow me . What now ? Looks like it 's working . What are you talking about ? The countdown clock ? With all the shield strength Concentrated in the direction of the pulsar , The engines are protected enough to generate an ftl jump . Yeah , but that 's a good thing , right ? I mean , this whole area of space is a dead zone . The sooner we get out of here , the better . All right , we 're close enough . You two meet up with Rush and brody ... Whoa , whoa , wait a minute . They would 've figured out who 's missing by now . They will be looking , so be careful . Where are you going ? Recon . We need to know what 's happening . Scott ... Eli , just go . I need some help over here ... Is he going to make it ? Yeah , he 'll be fine . The bullet passed clean through . Let me know when he wakes up . I want to talk to him . Listen , your commander wasn 't so lucky . Dr. Finch is working on her right now , But it isn 't looking good . We think the bullet may have lodged in her liver . It would be in everyone 's best interest If she survived . Yeah , I get that . What about Lieutenant johansen ? Well , we 've managed to stem the bleeding , But the baby 's heart rate is dangerously low . We may have to take it out prematurely . Right now , there 's no guarantee That either one of them will survive . Excuse me . Shh ... How about some coffee ? Sure . Where did all this stuff come from ? There 's no way you could have made it all . You got that right . We were still working on lean-to 's with dirt floors , And the winter was coming . Frankly , I was getting a bit worried . And then one day , on a scout , We found ' em . Half a dozen just like this , Scattered over the valley . We did an aerial survey . We would have seen them . I know . So ty just appear out of nowhere , And that 's good enough for you ? Well , I don 't think We would have survived the winter Without them , And that 's good enough for me . So why did they bring me here ? The ship was under attack , right ? How did you know that ? You were wounded . A lot of people were wounded , why would I be singled out ? They were scanning us The minute we set foot on this planet . They knew everything there is to know about us . They knew you were pregnant . What are you saying ? You were bleeding out on the table . This was the only way , Or your baby would have died . Report . The countdown clock has started again . It 's probably a result Of the adjustments made to the shield . How long till we jump ? Just under 30 minutes . Varro , this is Dr. Brightman . Go ahead . I 'm sorry to have to tell you this , but we did all we could . It just wasn 't enough . Your commander is dead . Down here , this way . We need weapons . There 's something else we need even more . You guys are back . You know , this ship is really , really , really big . Whoa , what 's that ? What happened ? Oh , nothing we need to worry about right now . What are we doing to get the ship back ? What ? It 's his idea . Colonel Telford 's efforts to divert control Were not entirely in vain . We still have a limited ability To manipulate power distribution , So I 've begun a slow process Of sequestering power away from the shields . E same shields that are protecting us From the deadly pulsar radiation ? That 's right . Like I said , his idea . Well , if I don 't do it , the ship 's going to jump . Good . No , no , no , Eli , you don 't understand . You see , that pulsar levels the playing field . It 's just as deadly to them as it is to us . Once they realize what 's happening , They 'll have no option but to deal . We need to kill them all . The original plan was to keep some of the scientists And drop the rest on a habitable planet . The original plan didn 't involve Kiva being killed . I admit it may have been optimistic To expect any of them to work with us , But going on a bloody rampage now Isn 't going to solve anything . You got another idea ? Tell them . We found one address We can dial from this position . It 's currently locked out , Probably because It 's at the extreme range of the gate . But I can get around that . We check it out . If it 's viable , we send them . Everyone except the doctors . They 're still working on some of our men . And Lieutenant johansen . She could prove to be useful down the road , And moving her now would be as good as killing her . What about Rush , And the others that are still missing ? Search parties will find them . We got to tell the others . Yeah . You never did answer my question . How do you know what 's happening on the ship ? I just do . It 's kind of hard to explain . The aliens told you ? Well , not face to face . Hey , come on in . Hi ! Oh , it 's getting cold out there . Dana , peter ? T.J ... Oh , my God , it 's good to see you . How are you ? I 'm fine . I 'm fine . How are you ? How are all of you ? We 're good , T.J. We 're good . We 're surviving . The others will be along soon . Word 's getting around . We were hoping we could see the baby . Sure . Yeah , she 's sleeping ... Don 't worry , we 'll be really quiet . Okay . Okay ? It 's big news around here . You want to take a walk ? It 's getting kind of dark , isn 't it ? It 'll be fine . They can look after the baby . There 's something I want to show you . He 's back . Simeon . Hurts , doesn 't it ? What happened ? I was hoping you could tell me . Where 's Kiva ? Dead . She was shot , just like you . We were in the gate room . We were attacked . They came out of nowhere . They ? There was more than one ? I 'm not sure . Did you see them ? No . Interesting . Because you weren 't shot from behind . It was dark , it happened fast . I saw Kiva get shot . I turned , everything went black . What 's going on with the ship ? What 's the situation ? The ship is ours . The shields are repaired . It 's over . What about Colonel Young and his crew ? We won 't have to worry about them too much longer . We 've found a planet with a breathable atmosphere . We 're putting you and your people off the ship . There is no way you have had enough time To determine long-term viability . There 's not a lot of options here . It 's a death sentence . Not necessarily . Now you 're thinking You 've got nothing to lose . You could jump me , take my gun , kill the guard outside . But how far do you really think you 'd get ? You 'd be shot , And your people would still be sent to the planet , Only without their leader . For their sake , I recommend you stay alive . Hey , Sergeant , how you feeling ? I 'll be all right , sir . Nice place . Looks like a storm 's coming . We need to find shelter , fast . Where the hell are Scott and Greer ? They should have been back by now . You have to calm down , Eli . Splitting up never works . Everyone knows this . It 's got to be them . No . No , not them . Back away from the consoles . Dannic , come in . Go ahead . We got Rush and three others . Well done . What happened ? I 'm not sure . The countdown stopped . Well , start it again . I can 't . Stand by . The radiation must be affecting the engines again . You said the shield would prevent that . It should . I don 't understand it . Then what good are you ? Dannic ! Dannic ! Bring Rush to the gate room . I have some questions for him . What about the others ? Kill them . You don 't want to kill anyone . You okay ? Is everybody okay ? Dannic , this is Rush . I 'm sorry to say your men were unable to carry out their orders . Anyway , by now you 'll have noticed that the countdown has stopped . That 's because I 've been draining power from the shields , and I will continue to do so until your men lay down their weapons . You and your people would die with the rest of us . We 're willing to die To prevent you taking over this ship . Can you say the same ? Find them . Dannic , listen to me . Don 't do this . This is your fault . If you had listened to me from the beginning , We wouldn 't be in this position . Take his weapon . There can only be one commander , And Kiva 's dead . Any objections ? What do we know about the planet ? Not much . Presumably , it has breathable atmosphere , Other than that ... We have to do something . Amen . No , no , this is perfect . It couldn 't have worked out better . They 're gonna be stranded down there . No , no , the ship won 't jump . We can pick them back up later . Plus , the planet is out of range of the pulsar . Believe me , they 're better off . What does that say for the rest of us ? Well , we 've done some calculations , And certain areas of the ship That are better protected than others Because of their location within the hull . Hydroponics , for one . We go there , seal ourselves in , We might be able to outlast them . What about the damage to the ship itself ? Without the shields , the next pulsar blast ... Damage will be minimal . Organic matter will suffer the most . Wait a minute , not everyone 's been sent off the ship . He mentioned something about T.J. It sounded like she 'd been injured , And something about doctors ? They might have used some of our people To get extra medical personnel on board With the stones . Well , we can 't just leave them out there . Not if we 're going to go through with this . All right , Greer and I will go get them . Give us 15 minutes To meet you back in hydroponics . After that , Seal the door . Colonel ! We found a system of small caves Just over that ridge About two klicks ! Should be enough to shelter everyone If we break into smaller groups ! That 's good enough ! Iguys , guys , back up . Dannic 's taken control . These men were loyal to me . All right , people , listen up ! We 're going to move out , But stay together . Let 's go ! Colonel ! I 've nothing to say to you . We 're here because I stood up for you ! He would have killed you all ! Wait , Camile ? What are you doing here ? Th-they used some of us To connect with a team of doctors . Me , volker , kemp and rieder . All right , where are the others ? I don 't know . There were more injured , and ... Anyway , they severed the connection ... Lieutenant ... What happened ? She was shot . She 's going to make it . What about the baby ? Camile , what about the baby ? Where are you taking me ? It 's just over here . You 'll get a better view . Oh , my God . That 's beautiful . Yeah . That wasn 't here . No , it showed up last night Just before you did . Any idea what it means ? Not a clue . Listen , I wanted to thank you . What for ? If you hadn 't decided to go back with Colonel Young , He would have taken all of us . I know what a sacrifice that was . And the aliens knew . I think that 's why They were willing to bring your daughter here . But ... But what ? Well , you made your choice . What are you talking about ? The baby can stay . We 'll take care of her , I promise you , But you have to go back . No . I 'm sorry . No , no ... No ! T.J. ! Let 's get her out of here . This way ! We 've got company . Take cover . Is that really necessary ? Well , they 're gonna figure out where we are sooner or later . Even if they can 't get in , They can still vent the atmosphere . And don 't worry , the plants are producing oxygen . We 'll have enough breathable air . For a while , anyway . That 's 15 minutes . You have to give them more time . The longer we wait , The greater the chance of being discovered . Eli ... We can give them a few more minutes . This is our only chance . If we fail and they take the ship , we 're as good as dead . Mr. Brody , seal the door . The next pulsar blast will be deadly to anybody outside this room . That 's the whole point , isn 't it ? Damnit ! Sergeant , I 'm moving ! Rush , this Scott , come in , please . Scott , this is Eli . Where are you ? We 're cut off . We can 't shoot our way through . Well , we haven 't sealed theoor yet . There 's still time . We 'll dial up the shields till you get back . That 'll just give them more time to find you . Our only chance is to stick with the plan . Seal the door . Do it . T.J. ? What have you done with her ? We haven 't done anything . I 'm not leaving without her . It 's not up to us . They can send you back whenever they want , And there 's nothing we can do about it . I 'm so sorry . At least this way you 'll know , You 'll always know , that ... She 's being taken care of . Everyone still alive in here ? For now . There 's no sign the storm 's letting up , So get comfortable . How much longer can it last ? I don 't know , you tell me . You 're the one who picked this place . It could go on for days , for all we know . It was this or the barrel of a gun , and you know it . James ! Hey , james ... James ... Easy , easy . I got you . Easy ... That really hurt . I 'll bet . Don 't move . You 're going to be okay . Have you restored the shields yet ? Rush is still bleeding power from the system . We can 't stop him . It 's worse than we thought . The next radiation spike from the pulsar Will collapse the shields completely . Now they know . No choice but to surrender . They found us . Dannic , we 've found a door we can 't open . Hydroponics . It appears to be sealed from the inside . We 've got them . Get some explosives . We 'll blow the door . You can 't do that . Any blast big enough to get you through the door Will kill the people on the inside . We need Rush to restore the shields . There isn 't enough time anyway . The next pulsar wave is in less than five minutes . Dannic , this is Rush . By now you know the situation . You have no choice . Lay down your weapons , And order your people To assemble in the observation deck . Once I receive visual confirmation of your compliance , I 'll dial up the shields . I still say you 're bluffing . Our position is well protected . Even without the shields , We 'll survive the next wave . You won 't . Either way , we 'll take the ship back . I don 't know . It 's possible . The man is a coward . He wouldn 't sacrifice himself . He 's telling the truth . You still have people out here . You 'd be killing them , too . A necessary sacrifice . He won 't do it . - Dannic ! - Enough . You don 't have a choice ... I said enough ! We 're not giving up this ship . He 's not bluffing . Just wait . He doesn 't even know we 're watching . This isn 't an act . You can 't do this . You 'll kill us all . We were prepared to die The moment we stepped through that gate . You 're insane . Did you ... did you just see that ? You can 't reason with someone like that . So , what about the others ? What about Scott and Greer , T.J. ? I 'm sorry . Listen to me . You know why we came here . You know what this ship means . Are you really prepared to let it go just when it 's in our grasp ? You mean your grasp . Don 't listen to him . He 's crazy . He will kill all of us . No . Just anyone who tries to get in my way . Telford is right . He was crazy . Rush ? Dannic is dead . We 'll comply with your demands . Carmen . That 's her name . After her grandmother . I know it 's not perfect here , But you said yourself It 's better than that ship . I still think there 's a chance They 're going to help us get back home . If they could do that , Then why haven 't they done it already ? I don 't know . Look , T.J. , I have to warn you . No one on the ship is going to understand . I barely understand myself . No , I mean ... They won 't believe , Because what they 've seen is different . What are you talking about ? I have learned one thing In all of this , And it 's that out here on the edge of the universe , Who you are and what you believe is everything . So it 's up to you to decide If this is a blessing or a curse . Goodbye , T.J. Camile ? Ah , it 's okay . Just , take it easy . How long was I gone ? What do you mean ? How long was I off the ship ? You were here the whole time , And the doctors worked on you ... They did the best they could , but ... I 'm so sorry . Welcome back . You take care , all right ? That way ! That way . Welcome back , sir . Well done , Sergeant . Well done , Lieutenant . It wasn 't really us , sir . Mostly it was Rush . So , what about them ? Let 's put them with the others . Excuse me . Sir ... Sir ? There 's something else . That was a quick jump . This is where we were supposed to come out before the Lucian alliance dialed in . Is there any deadly radiation ? Brody ? Hold on . We 're good . T.J ... You should not be getting up ... I 'm fine . I just need to clear my head right now .

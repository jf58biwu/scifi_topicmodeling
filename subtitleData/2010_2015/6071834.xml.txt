 Previously on Defiance ... Can you really do what you suggest in these pages ? Well , it would be something for the record books . You dumb-ass kid ! You brought this crap into my home ! You know how close they watch me ! That stolen tech must be pretty important . Or is it something else ? Uncle R , you gotta lead these people . You gotta lead the stand against the Earth Republic . Hello , my love . You should have made me a partner . I see a bright light . A white blinding light . The man who raped me . I didn 't even tell my fianc√© . Poor Connor had no idea . Connor ? As in Connor Lang ? Yes . Did you know him ? Seriously ? Hello ? Hello ? Who 's there ? Amanda , you 're mine . Okay , this guy , did you notice any details about him ? Species ? Human ? Votan ? No , I couldn 't see his face . I mean , the candles blew out . The door flew open and he rushed in . Did he say anything ? My name . So he knew you . I was mayor . The whole town knows me . What aren 't you telling me ? Years ago , there was a man in New York . He attacked me . I never saw his face , but I thought it was him . Yeah , I know it 's impossible , but ... I don 't know . Even if by some miracle he could 've followed me here ... Why ? Still , I ... Okay , when I get this guy , and I 'm gonna get this guy , we 're gonna find a much taller window for you to push him out of . Now , would you like me to leave Tommy or Irisa here , just to keep an eye on you ? No . No , I 'm okay . Yeah ? Just catch this guy . Oh , I 'm gonna do exactly that . Okay . Come on . Let 's go . " And the just man " cut the lies " from his wife 's heart " and prepared the holy feast . " Is this parable the one where the just man cooks his unfaithful wife and serves her body parts for supper ? It 's inspiring . It 's disgusting . What is it with you Castis ? Look , I know that you 're mad at Stahma ... She is a de-run-jo . She turned my son against me and convinced my crew to throw me out into the dirt . And you bear no responsibility for any of that . Well , whose side are you on ? Well , as one of your closer friends , which is hardly a crowded field ... I 'm on the side of watching you avoid any further acts of extreme self-sabotage . I 've killed men for speaking to me like that . First step is admitting there 's a problem , very good . Now . I want you to burn the Castithan crazy-scrolls and fix your family from the inside . I wish I could . Really ? I 've made too many mistakes . Stahma will never allow me back in . Well ... If you want it bad enough , you 'll find an angle . You 're a smart guy . Well , for a Castithan , I mean . Meh Yewll . Making house calls ? Now , I know the Arks have fallen . Lev . It 's been so long . I wasn 't sure you 'd recognize me . You 're not welcome here . To forgive is divine . No , it 's deeply human , which is something that neither of us are . We spent enough time learning to talk like them . Rocking the slang . Getting down with the idiomatic usage . Bedside manner . So they 'd trust us . Right up until we 'd sedate them and cut ' em open in the name of science . Nice seeing you , Lev . Meh , honey ... Goodbye , Lev . Don 't you want to know why I 'm here ? No . Not in the least bit curious ? Fine , why ? I 'm dying . A little jumpy , huh ? My nerves are shot . I understand . You have no idea what I 'm going through . Oh , of course I do . It 's your sister . No , this has nothing to do with Kenya . Oh , yeah it does . She was loving . Yeah ? You , you don 't love anything . I mean , you wouldn 't even know how . How can you say that ? You and me are the same . We both ... don 't really care about anyone . We 're just really good at faking it . That 's not true . I care about you . No , no , no . No , people like you and me , we screw our way through lives . Yeah ? And our relationships , they end in train wrecks . Me , I prefer it that way because the sex is better when you don 't complicate it . So , please , don 't tell me that you care about me . Because I don 't want that . I didn 't love your sister and I sure as shtako don 't love you . How could I , sweetheart ? You 're damaged goods . Now , where was that fire when we were in the sack ? I wouldn 't have had to imagine her . Ah ! First time 's foreplay . Second time I take you apart . You 're mine , Amanda . The adreno . Have you had any weirdness ? You look terrible . Any side effects ? Could you have gotten a bad batch ? Let 's go inside . Answer me . I get my adreno directly from Varus Soleptor . The pipeline 's impeccable . Then maybe I 'm crazy . Hey . Tell me what 's bothering you . I saw something that couldn 't possibly have happened . Then I thought I was being followed . I saw Nolan , only ... Only what ? Nothing . Never mind . Hey . Amanda . Amanda . You have been through a terrible trauma . Churchill , take her to McCawley 's house . No , no , no ... Okay . I 'm fine . You need protecting . I 'm fine . No arguments . You two , go make a pot of tang bark . It 's wrong that they 've taken over Rafe 's house . Rafe got what he deserved . He lied . He harbored a criminal . Him and Nolan , both . Nolan did what he thought was right . You go ahead and defend Nolan . To my death . So ... I searched your place this morning , top to bottom , inside out , looking for signs of the attacker . You know what I found ? You found nothing . That 's right . And you suspect that I broke the window myself . Well , can you explain it ? No . I did find this . Last time I checked , hallucinating was not a side effect of adreno . Well , it 's the best theory I got . I 'm sorry , Nolan . I 'm just tired . I just need some space , okay ? Yeah . Okay . Yeah . You gotta be kidding me . Hey , can you direct me to the showers ? You know , the shower , the water from up above ... Rub-a-dub-dub and , uh ... You don 't know what the hell I 'm talking about , do you ? Showers are for the lowest of liro . Let me prepare the water for you . I can manage on my own , thanks . It 's a privilege to serve the father of Favi Christie . She is a wonderful young human . Yeah , I think I 'll keep her . By the way , it 's , uh ... It 's nice of you to say that . I think I 'll get one of these . What ? Don 't be alarmed . I wanted to welcome you to our home . I should have stayed at the NeedWant . I told Christie that ... Christie was correct to want her father close . I would be appalled to see the father of my hanya tavo stay in a brothel when we have ample room . Uh , well this is only temporary until I find my own place , you see . In the meantime , we 'll see to your comfort . Judas Priest . Um , could you , um ... Cover up , please ? Do you know why Castithan women wear a beaded gown when bathing ? No ... Only their husbands are allowed to be naked , as Rayetso made them . In many ways you humans are much more ... liberated . Not in every way . I know you had Alak beaten last year , and threatened him with even greater bodily harm if he continued in the family business . I want to assure you , he is merely a figurehead , a concession to the male orthodoxy of our culture . I run the family business now . Well , I 'm glad to hear that , I guess . I 'm telling you this because I want your relationship with Alak to be a ... strong one . Datak is gone from our lives now and ... You , Christie , and the child are what I consider family . I hope you will consider making your stay here a permanent one . Oh , I 'll think about that . Please do . And , in the meantime , enjoy your bath . Good afternoon . Leave . I 'm afraid I can 't do that , Raiga . I said , " Leave . " Step aside . State your business and go . I can barely speak . That pu-va-ko split my lip . He deserves a raise . You know you 're not welcome here . And I penitently bear the bruises of the lesson you so ably administered . But I am here to ... McCawley . Datak . - What 's he doing here ? - Rafe is family . Pottinger threw me out of my digs . I must admit , I had my doubts about crashing here , but your wife , or your ex-wife , I suppose , she put them at ease . I , uh , borrowed your slippers . Hope that 's okay . You were saying ? " The fallen man knelt in supplication , and Rayetso spoke unto him and said , " ' For though thyself be covered in sins , they shall not be visited on thy children . " ' In the name of my unborn grandchild , I salt these pure petals , with my tears and blood . And so the fallen shall rise and be welcomed back . Wait , he quotes a scripture , pretends to be sorry , and you 're gonna let him back ? Hana-tova , there are many things about our culture I fear you will never understand . He ... He does not ask to be taken back as tan-da-bo-lo , the head of the household . I suppose you humans would call it the right of visitation . It 's the old Hail Mary play . No , he burned Alak . You crushed your son 's hand ! Let it go . There are laws . I 'm not letting him near my child . The protocols of shi-zhi-no-lo have been met . I assert my right to safeguard my lineage . You 're a disgusting troll . Well , what family doesn 't hit a rough patch now and then . I 'll see myself out . Did you hear something ? Tommy , there 's somebody out there . You stay right here . Tommy ? Tommy ! It can 't be vulukot fibrosis . I told you it was . That 's impossible . We designed the bug to kill humans . Only humans . Maybe it 's a mutated strain . All I know is , it 's slowly killing me . We have a serum . You think I didn 't try the cure ? It doesn 't work on Indogenes . Well there must be something you missed . I have a contact in Marin County . I didn 't come here to be healed . I came here to be forgiven . You 're obviously suffering from dementia as well . I 'll make a note . Meh ! Don 't be like that . Like what ? Like myself ? Exactly . I came here to say goodbye . Goodbyes are overrated . Roll up your sleeve , I want to take another blood sample . No ! Let 's go for a walk instead . What the hell . Yewll 's not answering . Hey ! Tommy , stay awake . Bad idea to nod off with a concussion , buddy . You 've been hit . Let me see . No , it 's fine . Irisa , let me see . It 's not my blood . See ? The bullet missed me . Well , whose blood is it , then ? It 's all over your arm . All over the floor . Where 's Amanda ? She ran off . She 's terrified . Doubting everything she sees . Strung out on drugs . Well , why aren 't we out there looking for her ? Hey , Defiance , we 've got an emergency bulletin from everyone 's favorite lawkeeper . Anyone with eyes on one Miss Amanda Rosewater should hit up his hailer tout de suite . You know the number . Call me . Sorry , I was just looking for ... Yeah . Your husband . Yeah . Yeah , it 's been a regular missing persons unit around here . He 's not answering his hailer . How do you know he 's not answering his hailer ? I work for him . He 's hard to reach . I never seem to know where he 's at anymore . Oh , sounds like you 're losing your mojo , newlywed . Hmm ? Maybe I can help you find it . I 've got a break coming up . That 's how Alak mangled his hand ? His dad ? Can you believe it ? And today he almost wormed his way back into Stahma 's good graces . Castis . Crazy . I 've been living in their home , learning their language , cooking their gross food , and they still treat me like an outsider . But Datak ... Datak gets to atone . I just don 't get these people . You can practice all the rituals you want , but in the end , you have to live in their skin , as we Night Porters say . Okay , and how am I supposed to " live in their skin " ? Come play with me , hmm ? What do you mean ? It 's a secret . Please . All right , take care . Favi Tarr , what are you in the market for ? A bit of strange . That Casti tongue of yours holds our language well . One of its many uses . Let 's go upstairs . Champagne room . Your breath is very Irathient , by the way . What do you want ? I wish to conduct business with your spymasters . Your usefulness has diminished . Along with your position in this town . Your wife , however , has been very generous in support of our cause . I was curious whether your Irathient deity had blessed you with a mind as appealing as your body . But it seems Irzu is a stingy god . Counting Datak Tarr out of any race is a terrifically bad bet . Enough . I have customers , real customers . So what do you want from the Votanis Collective ? Well , first , let 's examine what I have to offer . Defiance exists in a state of ongoing political flux . Now with the right alliances , that I myself can broker , the direction of these changes can be controlled . And what direction do you envision ? Away from the Earth Republic . You have my full attention . If those bloody cameras were still working , we 'd have found her by now . You know , my sources tell me there 's been no Blue Devil to be had in town for weeks . Yet Amanda seems to have an endless supply . You got anything to say on that front ? Amanda is an adult . Uh-huh . I help her as a friend . Yes , see I see that different . I see a guy so desperate to get a woman in the sack he 's willing to turn her into a junkie to do it . Amanda would slap you for saying that . Yes . Yes , she would . But Amanda is not here . So maybe you wanna slap me ? Defend her honor ? I 'm gonna ask you this one time . Did you spike her adreno ? Some kind of hallucinogen , or Votan roofie ? You 're fired . We 're way past that point now . What exactly is that supposed to mean ? It means you messed with Amanda . So if you want the badge back you 're gonna have to take it off my dead body . That 's not a bad idea . You wanna take your shot , go right ahead , but make it a good one . See , about nine months ago , I died . Didn 't take . True story . Connor ? We 're not done here . Hey ! Nolan ! They found Amanda . You okay , boss ? Amanda ? Amanda ? Amanda . Hey . Hey . Look at me . That 's it . Can you hear me ? Amanda ? Amanda ? Hey . Hey . Come on . Connor ? I found the hair . My hair . You took my brush . What are you talking about ? Can you be a man about this one thing ? Something ? Anything ? You 're not real . You 're dead . You died in this town . You were shot by an Irathient terrorist . Oh , you don 't really believe that , do you ? Jeez , Niles , my killer ? It 's obvious if you just look at the facts . What ? But that 's never been your way . The truth is your enemy . It makes you look at some unpleasant things . Ah , shut up . Take Amanda . Our girl . So beautiful . What , you figured that by having her it would help you be me ? You 'll never be me . Incidentally , I forgot to thank you for the watch . The Bulova . Old world . It was just a little awkward , given that I barely knew you . Was it supposed to be an apology ? It was a gift . Hmm . Schoolboy crush . Little Niles first-year . So sweet . But you knew we all laughed at you , right ? All the sixth formers . I mean it was so obvious . Did you laugh ? Yes , I did . What can I say ? I was 17 . I thought it was funny . Life was a lot funnier before the Votanis Collective wrecked the place . Do you not remember holding me ? You ... I told you , " You would be okay . " And Votans wouldn 't hurt us . " That was a lie . Yeah . And what they did to Coleman . That was the worst . I never got over that day . I think ... I think maybe ... That 's why I am the way I am . No . Some people , when they 're born , they just come out wrong . That 's why you stared at me . That 's why you stole the hair from my brush . It 's why you followed me to New York . You 're a sick little pervert who deserves to die . She keeps touching the back of her neck . Here . Let 's have a look at that . Help me get her over . I 've seen this in soldiers out west . It 's an EGO implant . This one 's defective . If we don 't get it out , it 's gonna kill her . What 's an EGO ? It 's a military implant . It fuses with the body and provides intel . Well , aren 't those things supposed to help you in combat ? Not if it 's damaged . If the component is compromised , it can stop your heart or cut your spine . You fight in the Pale Wars ? Didn 't everybody ? Hmm . Doc ! Doc ! Doc ! Where the hell is she ? Things have changed so much since we first arrived . We came here to change this world , and we did . It 's beautiful . We came here to destroy this world , and we did . And this town smells . There 's no poetry in your heart anymore . Anymore ? Was there ever ? Yes . " Our bodies were the temple " and our prayers so beautiful " they must have made God cry . " My Meh Yewll . You could always melt me . I wrote that to get in your pants . It worked . You think you could ever forgive me ? For leaving you ? I 've missed you . I had to leave . Because of what we did . They weren 't animals . They were people like us . They had names , they had dreams , hopes , futures . I know ... We killed children . I said , " I know . " We watched them die , then talked shop . Made jokes . Gallows humor . It changed you . I 'd touch you and you 'd jerk away . You used to say , " A touch could heal . " I will heal you . And we 'll live happily ever after . Oh . I see . What ? You don 't remember . Remember what ? It 's your orderly Indogene brain trying to process the inexplicable . You remember that I left . But not how I left . You didn 't want to remember . No , Lev . I died eight years ago after I opened my veins , and I left you holding all that guilt . Say you forgive me . I do . Come with me . I can 't . You can . Just take my hand . We 'll be together . Her breathing is shallow . There 's no Doc . We 're gonna have to operate . Help me , here . Yeah . I 'm on it . Come on . Finish off that dressing . All right . You got her ? Good . Okay . Sterile mist . You 've done this before ? Yeah , sure . A long time ago . The patient live ? Does now really look like a good time to chip away at my confidence ? Sorry . Oh , geez . There it is . What ? I can 't remember whether to cut around the device , or into it . You don 't know ? I may not have actually done this procedure myself , but I think he cut around it . Do it . All right . No ! Cut into the device first . It will remove itself . Where the hell were you ? Booty call . Catch your breath . I 'll close this up . See ? I 'm not allowed to die . Not for a good long time . Why not ? Because these people need me . It 's my penance . Oh , sure , Datak . Why don 't you just help yourself ? Is there anything extra I could order for you for my dinner ? A bit of soothing tea . You wouldn 't believe the day I 've been having . So , I hope my home has provided you with comfort in a difficult time . Do I look insincere ? Eh , your face is kind of built that way . Hmm . I 'm glad there 's a strong man around to look after things while Stahma and I work through this period of trials . We 're family after all . Bonded by blood . All right , what do you want ? I want to regain my place in this family . I want my life back . Tall order , that . Rafe , you understand how important discipline is . You 've raised three children . But knowing where to draw the line is what matters most . And I regret that I crossed that line with Alak . You think ? I want to mend things with my son , with Christie . A word in the ear from you might help sway her . In time , of course . Why the hell do you think I would I ever consider helping you ? Well , I heard about what happened to Rupert , his sons , Hyatt and Josef . You were close to the family , weren 't you ? Yeah . We were . Hmm . Hmm . Yeah . Ah , the Earth Republic . The Earth Republic has taken so much . Your mines . Your home . Yeah , well , times are tough all over . Mmm . Well , there 's not much one man can do on his own . I learned that hard lesson when I stabbed their Colonel Marsh with a letter opener . Well , what you did was stupid . Hmm . Perhaps . But had I possessed 1,000 letter openers , and 1,000 strong hands to wield them ? I 've been talking with the Votanis Collective . About what ? Weapons . My life has taken a decided turn for the worse since the Earth Republic arrived . I think it 's time we take back our town . What do you say ? Hmm . You 're still sitting here . Yes . I was worried about you . I wasn 't myself . Yeah . Yeah , I know . How 's Tommy ? Irisa ... God , I can 't believe I shot her . Ah , Tommy 's got a hard head . You missed Irisa . No , I didn 't . I clearly saw that ... I was hallucinating . Yeah . Hey . Don 't . Sorry . You know , uh , what you thought you saw ... What you might have heard me say , you know that wasn 't real , right ? How did this happen to me ? Either you came in contact with someone implanted with a defective EGO without knowing it , or ... Or ? Or someone infected you on purpose . Who would do that ? You promised this procedure would be safe . And you promised a pristine E6 protocol EGO device . Not this re-purposed shtak from Von Bach 's reject pile . I did the best I could . Well , in any event , it worked . Over the last three weeks , all of Amanda 's relevant memories have been quietly uploaded to my data repository . We 're ready for the next step . Good . That 's good . How did we end up with these egos inside us ? Oh , it happens from time to time on the battlefield . An EGO gets split into shrapnel and implanted in different soldiers . The particle walls must have gotten compromised when we injected it . The little suckers went looking for new a host . And found us . Which is why these operations are usually done in a lab . In a controlled environment . My memories . Did they go anywhere ? No . They weren 't recorded . What about ... The one in my head ? I dug it out . And destroyed it . So what are you gonna do ? Just leave it in ? No , I 'm gonna take it out . Just not yet . Why ? Because I 'm not ready to let you go .

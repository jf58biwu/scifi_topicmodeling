 Previously on Touch ... The numbers your son gives you aren 't new . He found the Amelia Sequence . - You 're still chasing ghosts . - I know what I saw . There 's a girl in that room . Her name is Amelia . If you don 't believe me , just check it ! You 're part of this . Oh , no . Numbers are constant . Until they 're not . Our inability to influence outcome is the great equalizer . Makes the world fair . Computers generate random numbers in an attempt to glean meaning out of probability . Endless numerical sequences , lacking any pattern . During cataclysmic global events- - tsunami , earthquake , the attacks on 9 / 11- - these random numbers suddenly stop being random . As our collective consciousness synchronizes , so do the numbers . Science can 't explain the phenomenon , but religion does . It 's called prayer . A collective request , sent up in unison . A shared hope . Numbers are constant , until they 're not . Hi . They said you were in here . Nice office . I wish . It 's not mine . We haven 't got a lot of time . Look at this . What ? There 's a gap in the footage . Why ? I don 't know , but we 're missing a few seconds of Teller , outside of room six . It 's the weirdest thing . When the footage starts again , this happens . Can you zoom in ? Play it again . Okay , stop . Look right there . Teller 's giving Jake something . What is it ? I 'm not sure , but ten minutes later , he was dead . I want to see my son now . Hey , buddy . Jake ... I want you to look at something , okay ? This is Dr. Teller . He came to see you last week . I need to know if he gave you something . Teller 's visitor 's badge . 1-1-8-8 . It 's a dead man 's hand . - What ? - It 's a poker thing . The aces represent ones . Aces and eights . It was the last hand that Wild Bill Hickok was holding before he was shot . 1-1-8-8 . So Teller left this as a clue . A road map . A road map , right , Jake ? Hi , I 'm Natalie and Welcome to Video Blog 1188 . I have a story I want to share with you . I just really thought Paris was the answer . You see , I 've been working so hard in school , and ... You know what ? I 'm not gonna lie . I was hoping to meet someone . Okay , you see ? The guy I 'd been dating for six months , Daryl , well , a week before we 're supposed to leave to backpack Europe together , Daryl decides that , well , he 's just not that into me anymore , and maybe Europe 's not the best idea . I decided to go anyway . It rained for a week straight , I read every book I could find , and then just when I was thinking about heading to another country , I found this . A flash drive , on the floor of the hostel where I was staying . And this is what was on it . _ _ Okay . So , I speak Italian because I 'm an Italian history major , but for those of you who don 't , Paolo meets Celeste at the Piazza Navona in Rome , and it is thunderbolt love . _ _ _ _ But before he has the chance to even kiss her , her friends sweep her away , and the next morning , she leaves for Paris . All he knows is that she is going to be in New York City for her birthday , march 28 , so he decides to fly there and meet her . _ Now Celeste has absolutely no idea that Paolo 's even looking for her , and she won 't know to meet him at Kismet , and that just breaks my heart . So ! I am thinking that we should help find her . If you know who she is , or how to contact her , then upload a video to my Web site . Oh , come on , people . The world needs more Paolos and less Daryls . Let 's find Celeste ! You ... Who are ... ? You startled me . You 're the guy from the hospital . You 're the nurse . I saw you at the funeral . My father 's funeral . I 'm so sorry for your loss . I 'm a friend of your father 's . My name is Martin Bohm . What , so you thought you 'd just break in his house ? No ! No , no , no . He gave me this key . I-I thought it was for his house , but ... the door was open , so I just let myself in . This isn 't his house key . He worked with my son . My son 's name is Jake . Oh . The miracle boy he was talking about . Y-Yes . He came to see me a couple days ago at the hospital ... He was having another brain event . Another ? Years ago , he had something similar . The doctors thought it was a stroke , but he healed , and he became obsessed with ... patterns , and that led him to ... numbers , and equations . So you know about your father 's research . I was his assistant . I watched him lose everything . He wasn 't a prophet , Mr. Bohm . He had damage to his brain , and if he had accepted that fact , I could have helped save him . Your father left that key with my son . And , I think , for a reason . I think he wanted me to have access to his research . Well , he didn 't keep any of it here . Do you know where he kept it ? When he refused my help at the hospital , I came by to check on him , and I followed him to a basement on the corner of Third and Allan . The next day , same thing . I think this key might fit that door . Thank you . Her name is Abigail Kelsey . She says she 's Jake 's aunt , but she 's not on the approved visitors list . Mrs. Kelsey ? Clea Hopkins . - Oh , hello . - Hi . I 've been filling out this damn thing for the past ten minutes . It 's amazing they don 't ask for my blood type . Yes , I 'm sorry . You 're not on the approved visitors list , and what with families being ... complicated , we have to take precautions . Oh , so you mean it 's not because my brother-in-law told you we don 't exactly get along ? He might have indicated that , but as Jake 's sole guardian , he has the right to determine who visits . You 're right ; I 'm sorry . I just moved back to New York , and I was just really anxious to reconnect with my little chipmunk . I 'm sure you and Martin can figure something out . I hope so . I can wait here while you call him . Oh , in the meantime , I brought something for Jake . It 's my company 's latest computer tablet . It 's not gonna be out on the market until this summer , but I was able to pull a couple of strings . I thought that it might help Jake communicate . I 'll let Jake know it 's from you . Then I 'll call Martin . - Thank you . - Okay . Doesn 't work . Who are you ? Uh , I 'm sorry . I 'm a friend of Arthur Teller 's . You want in , it 's a thousand bucks . " I , George Herman Jones , being of sound and disposing mind do hereby declare and publish this to be my last will and testament . " Can we just jump to the important part ? You mean the part where he leaves you money ? Don 't hold your breath . Don 't make me the bad guy here , Zeke . This is not about money . Yeah , right . As his only heir , I 'm just here to get the deed so I can liquidate the station . Just ... keep reading . " I hereby grant and bequeath all property , which includes all 1188 hectares pertaining to the Groton Valley Station , to my friend and companion of 20 years ... " " ... Zeus . " My father left the station to his damn horse ? Zeus was here when he was sick . So was I. I came all they way here from New Jersey to do us all a favor , to sell this place , to try and at least break even . I 'd say that 's Zeus ' decision now . - No , there is no way that my father ... - You two might want to wait till you hear the rest . " And finally , as for my useless city slicker of a son , Devon Michael Jones , if by some miracle he should decide he wants the station , then his ownership will be based on one condition ... " He didn 't stipulate how long or how far I 'm supposed to ride him ? I reckon you mount him ... and the place is yours . How hard can that be ? There 's some general rules to follow when approaching a horse for the first time . Yeah , yeah . I got it . First rule ... always keep the gate shut . What a week . Since I posted Paolo 's video Valentine , I 've heard from people all over the world ... New Zealand . Denmark . American Samoa . I never even knew where that place was , but now , if I ever find myself there , I can sleep on this girl 's couch . Ooh , and these girls are hilarious . They have their own show called Happy Pop Twins . I subscribe to their channel and I found the coolest band . _ _ _ _ _ But anyway , this is why we 're all here . To help Paolo . I mean , like , aw , look at that face . The way he 's looking at her . Uh , I mean , he 's ... looking at the camera , but ... you know , he 's talking to her . Celeste is one lucky girl . A thousand dollars . Have a seat . Deal him in , Stacey . Hi . My name 's Martin . Your Aunt Abigail brought this for you , Jake . See this icon here ? It links pictures with spoken words . Bird . Can you say " bird " ? So this morning I wake up and this guy Jorge from Argentina has posted this ... Okay , he 's basically saying that Celeste has to be from Argentina because they invented dulce de leche and now ... all other ice cream makers have stolen it for their own . _ _ _ _ _ _ Oh , obviously , he 's talking about Celeste . Not that I think Paolo doesn 't deserve Celeste . I think that Paolo deserves whoever he wants . You know , maybe he 's talking about Daryl . You know , if , um ... if Celeste doesn 't show up , then Paolo 's gonna be crushed . I wish ... I wish we could all be there for him . Like , if we can all show our support from wherever we are . Oh , like , um , like a worldwide thing on March 28 . Ha ! And we can ... we can all wear red ! Like , uh , a red scarf or a red hat . Oh , and upload a video of yourself . I 'll edit it together . This is gonna be amazing . Team I Believe in Love , let 's do it ! Here , Zeus . Not gonna hurt ya . I just want to put this bit in your mouth . Blinds are 10 , 25 . My friend Arthur Teller told me about this game . Any of you know him ? Action . Fold . Let 's raise 150 . Call , raise , or fold ? Of course . I will ... - call . - I fold . How about you ? Do you know Arthur Teller ? You another math guy ? Sort of . If you 're playing those numbers of his , - they never work . - What numbers ? His sequence . He always bets on cards in some crazy number sequence . Aces , eights ... Excuse me ? Nothing . It 's on you . I 'm all in . Yeah , I got your money covered . Call . Let 's see ' em . Looks like you walked into a buzz saw . Guess that 's why they call it a dead man 's hand . Full house wins . Cash me out . 20 , 40 , 60 , 80 , 100 . 20 , 40 , 60 , 80 a hundred . Is there a problem here ? Jonathan will be taking over for Stacey , folks . Hey . Wait . What the hell just happened back there ? I got screwed . Again . That 's what happened . Well , who 's Logan ? None of your business . Look , my friend Arthur Teller , I think he wanted me to find you or this Logan guy . The problem is I don 't know why because he just passed away . Teller is dead ? Yes . My God , I wonder if Logan knows . Please , who is Logan ? Uh ... a player . In every sense of the word . He started playing here around the same time Teller did . They 'd talk about numbers . W-Wait . He 's a numbers guy , too ? He 's a math professor somewhere . Maybe he lied about that , too . What do you mean ? What else would he lie about ? Logan played at my table six weeks in a row . We got friendly . It 's against the rules . I thought I 'd been in this racket long enough to spot a con . Week six , he won big . Two hundred thousand dollars . Never saw him again . And now I 'm paying back his winnings because the house runners figured I was in on it . Look , I 'm sorry . And I know this must be difficult for you , but please ... Is there any way you could think of that I might be able to find this guy Logan ? I don 't know , and I don 't care . I 'm trying to forget I ever met him . Look ... Geez . Yeah ? Martin , it 's me , Clea . Your sister Abigail is here . Abigail ? What the hell is she doing here ? She claims she just wants to see Jake . Listen to me , don 't let her see Jake . Do you understand ? Do not let her anywhere near my son . I 'm on my way . - I don 't understand . - She 's a member of Jake 's extended family . - She could offer support that will help your case . - Trust me , her only goal is to take my son away from me . Well , it 's nice to see you again too , Martin . Well , I 'm sure you two have a lot of catching up to do . I thought you should know I just filed a petition to become Jake 's legal guardian . - What ? - Don 't flatter yourself , Abigail . They 're not gonna let you take Jake away from me . Well , it 's doubtful you can stop me this time , isn 't it ? Spotlight 's shining pretty bright on you now , what with being so inconsistent in attending Jake 's evaluations while he 's been here . - How did you get a hold of his file ? - You know what ? With all your money and your influence didn 't work the first time . - So take your best shot . - You 're going up in front of the review board and you 're gonna lose . And when you do , the state 's gonna institutionalize him , and they 're gonna put Jake someplace unbearably far away from the both of us . Giving me full custody is your best option . If Sarah knew what you were doing right now , she would ... Forget it . You ... you just stay the hell away from my son . Hey , buddy . Just came by to check in on you . What you got there ? Your computer tablet- - I haven 't seen one like that . It 's cool . What are you looking at , Jake ? Hmm ? Oh , my God . Logan Coteweiler . Professor of mathematics , Margrave University . Jake , do you want me to see that man ? Is that what you want ? Okay . I 'll be back as soon as I can . Daryl called me . He said that ... I was making a fool out of myself with these videos , and the whole thing was silly and uncool . Well , nobody 's ever accused me of being cool . I was imagining what it must be like to have someone ... search for me like that . Fly across the ocean to meet me on my birthday . Ugh . I 'm sorry , everyone . I 'm signing off . All right now , take it easy . You want my help ? Just ask . Sure . 'Cause you 're rooting for me . I bet my father owes you more money than this place was worth . Well , I didn 't quit on him , and he didn 't quit on me . I didn 't quit . I saw the writing on the wall . I was good with numbers . That is not my fault . I went to America , to university to make something of myself . With no help from him , I might add . You want this station , you got to make that horse respect you . All right , fine . I can use a little help . All right . First ... a horse can smell the city on you . You got to fool them into thinking you 're something other than what you are . Well , how do I do that ? Take off that expensive shirt and get dirty . This is absolutely amazing . - Well , you 're so welcome . - Oh , Clea . Ms. Kelsey here has generously offered to endow a beta-tablet pilot program for our special-needs clients . Isn 't that great ? How charitable . You may not approve , but everything I am doing is in Jake 's best interest . Is it ? Oh , my God . He looks more like my sister every day . I 'm not gonna let you take him without a fight . I don 't owe you an explanation . But you 'll come to see for yourself that I came back here to protect him . Protect him from what ? Logan Coteweiler . Damn it . Professor ? Professor ? Oh , no . Oh , my God . I have an emergency . I found a man unconscious . Margrave University Math Department . Medications ? I-I-I don 't know ; please , just get the paramedics here as soon as you can . Thank you . Come on . Oh ! Oh , come on , man . I smell like mud . Well , the joke 's on me , isn 't it ? You got me all the way down here , and you made a fool of me . I never was good enough for you . I can 't even ride a horse . I just wanted you to love me . Uh ... Hi , my name is Martin Bohm . Do you know Logan Coteweiler ? Yeah , yeah , why ? I just found him unconscious . Nobody 's here ; yours was the last number he tried to dial . He 's diabetic . Wait , wait . Where are you ? - In his office . - All right , there 's ... There 's a small refrigerator behind his desk . On the second shelf , th-th-there are syringes loaded with insulin . Hold on . Okay , I got it . Where do I inject him ? The arm , bum , doesn 't matter . Hold on . Come on . Stay with me . Come on . Is he okay ? Come on . - Is he okay ? - Come on . Uh , is he coming to ? You 're gonna be all right . Hello ? - Hello ? - Okay , he 's coming to . Thank you . I 'll have him call you back . So , I woke up this morning to a flood of e-mails and video posts . You guys are amazing . Just married ! Don 't give up , Natalie . We believe in love . You are not dumb because love is never dumb . And I will fight for love with you . You 're an inspiration . That guy Daryl was a jerk . Don 't listen to Daryl . The whole world is on your side . You made me feel ... very loved . And you know what ? Love is not silly . And anyone who thinks it is , well , I feel sorry for you . But now for the news we 've all been waiting for . We found Celeste . Well , sort of , um ... This guy who 's been traveling in Brazil he found this phone- - it 's been skipping around the world , and one of them is of Celeste . _ _ _ _ _ So , Celeste will meet Paolo at Kismet , like we all hoped . And please remember to wear red wherever you are . We are actually doing this , people . Thank you very much . How did you find me ? It 's a long story . But I did run into the dealer from your poker game , Stacey . You 're lucky I found you instead of her . She doesn 't like you very much . I didn 't con her . I fell in love with her . We were just there to win the money . What do you mean , " we " ? My partner and I. Teller ? I was just using his sequence . You see ? He called it the Amelia Sequence . You know , at first , I thought it was crazy , but it 's like nothing I 've ever seen . It 's like the mind of God or something . It 's a deterministic algorithm . I mean , it turns Schrodinger 's equation on its head . It-it 's the past ; it 's the present , the future . What does that have to do with poker ? Probability . Chance . Distilled to its essence . It 's the perfect formula for winning at Texas Hold ' Em . By the time I worked out all the kinks , I 'd racked up $ 200,000 in debt . I just wanted to break even and get out . Well , who is your partner ? Devon , my colleague . And that 's the man I was talking to on the phone ? Yeah . One night , we won big , and I 'm thinking , " Okay . I 'm done . I 'm free . I 'm out . " But the pit boss , he saw me with Stacey , and he figured we were cheating . He banned me from the game . I haven 't been in touch with her since . I didn 't want her to get involved . Well , they 're still making her pay back your winnings . What ? They ... They can 't do that . She had nothing to do with it . I got to help her . I don 't see how you 're gonna do that unless you have the 200 grand just lying around . 50,000 of it left . I can use the 50 to win 200 more . There 's a high stakes game in Hoboken . 25 grand buy-in . Problem is my partner 's in Australia . I wish I could help you out , but that 's not why I came here . Teller gave me this key . Aces and eights . It 's a dead man 's hand ; that 's what we won on that night . I think it opens the door to the place where he 's holding his research . I was hoping you could tell me where that is . Tell you what . You be my partner . You help me win the money for Stacey , and I will tell you where that key fits . Well , what do you say ? All right , 25 for you . 25 for me . Now , trust me , the guys in this game , they 're not gonna have much of a sense of humor if we get caught . So , no matter what happens in there , you do not deviate from the plan . I 'll go in first . Once we 're inside , we do not talk to each other . We do not even make eye contact , you understand ? Yeah . You 're gonna be fine ; you just have to remember , when I go like this , you fold . When I cough , you raise . You got it ? Yeah , as long as that 's all I have to remember . Now , we do this right , I 'll be able to pay off Stacey 's debt , and you 'll be able to use that key Arthur Teller gave you . What if we do it wrong ? - $ 2,000 . - I call . $ 2,000 to call . I fold . I fold . I 'm out . - $ 17,500 to go . - Really ? Again ? I don 't know what you 're playing , - but it 's not poker , pal . - I fold . You can 't really win at poker unless you get the cards . Want to double the stakes ? I want to double the stakes . - Do all players agree ? - Mm-hmm . Sure . $ 400 to call . $ 1,700 . I 'll call . Make your bet . $ 1,700 to call . - I fold . - Out Eight of spades , ten of clubs , king of diamonds . $ 6,500 . Bet 's at $ 6,500 . I 'll raise . $ 15,000 to go . 13,300 . To you , sir . I 'm all in . Oh-ho , now it 's getting fun . I 'm out . Um ... I 'll call . Gentlemen , can we see your cards , please ? Hope your cabdriver 'll take credit cards . Player to my left has two pair , kings and tens . Player to my right showing ... a pair of eights . You went all in on a bottom pair ? I 'm feeling lucky . And the turn . Jack of hearts- - no help to either player . Would 've made three jacks . And the river . An ace of spades . Oh , come on ! Player wins , aces and eights . I 'll cover that cab ride home for you . $ 11,000 , $ 12,000 , $ 13,000 , $ 14,000 ... $ 15,000 ... $ 16,000 ... $ 200,000 . That 's all of it . I hope ... that makes things right . Stacey , please , just ... don 't go . Just ... just give me a minute to ... apologize , okay ? - Here 's your change , sir . - Thank you . Oh , my God . I meant it when I wrote it , and I mean it now . - You used me . - I didn 't . I love you . I love you , Stacey . That 's the truth . I come to this restaurant every ... every Thursday , 8 : 00 a.m. before my class for breakfast . Just , if you ever want to talk or ... grab a cup of coffee , whatever , just ... I 'll be here . Please . You all right ? Well , I hope you see her again . Thanks for helping me out . What , you forget about your end of the bargain ? Right . About that . A couple blocks from here , right on the corner , it 's a big red door with a lot of wrought iron on it . - Good luck . - You , too . Thanks . Okay , here we are . March 28 , Cafe Kismet . The night Paolo finds true love . And I 'll be here to watch it happen . Hey . All right . Natalie ? Oh , my God ! It 's you ! It 's Natalie ! We flew all the way from Albuquerque . You came just for this ? Yeah ! Check out the scarves ! Jorge ! You came all the way from Argentina ? Of course I did . Claro que si . And ... I brought you my abuelita 's famous dulce de leche from Argentina where it was invented . Eh ? Natalie ... ! Ciao , Paolo . _ Natalie . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ I believe in love . So do I. What about Celeste ? _ _ _ _ _ _ You know , I realized something when I was riding him , something that maybe my dad was trying to tell me all along . Being out here has value that goes beyond profit . So , you 're gonna stay ? Run the station ? Stay ? Me ? No . I 'm going back home to my job in New Jersey . Truth is ... there 's only one person I know who loves this place the way my dad did . It 's yours , Zeke . It belongs to you now . During cataclysmic global events , our collective consciousness synchronizes . So do the numeric sequences created by random number generators Science can 't explain the phenomenon , but religion does . It 's called prayer . A collective request sent up in unison , a shared hope , fear relieved , a life spared . Numbers are constant until they 're not . In times of tragedy times of collective joy , in these brief moments , it is only the shared emotional experience that makes the world seem less random . Maybe it 's coincidence . And maybe it 's the answer to our prayers .

 Don 't know how many times I 've been crossed off the list and left for dead . I guess when it first happens on the day you were born , you gonna lose count . So this ... this ain 't nothing new . RIDDICK There are bad days . And then , there are legendary bad days . This was certainly meant to be one of those . Whole damn planet wanted a piece of me . I can 't stay in the open . I can 't risk another attack . It 's always the punch you don 't see coming , that puts you down . Oh , why didn 't I see it ? Of course someone would try to kill me , death is what picked him before another . So the question ain 't " What happened ? " . The question is ... What happened to me ? You are the Lord Marshal now . How they get so close ? How did they imply inside me like that ? Necromongers . Someone would put a crown on my head , someone to put a noose around my neck . Oh , please . Come back to bed . Every Lord Marshal was supposed to take some bed oath . One that I ... never really got around to . I can say I created a little friction . Handling more than a few assassins . I needed away out . Far new place . Or maybe just ... old one . Furya . I know what is called . You just don 't know where it is . - I need charts . I need maps . - Impossible . I need a direction . Purged from all records , as you well know . But you remember where , Commander Vaako . So many worlds . The only map left in existence , is the one in my head , Riddick . So , what do you want ? The crown . Transcendence . Krone . Breakup a ship . Riddick is going home . Vaako . I can 't blame him for dangling Furya . Home has a certain equity . But I do blame him , for what came next . It 's a long way to come . For this . This guy with the fucked up face , Krone . He was supposed to be our ride home . And instead of Furya , we wind up some place called , " Not Furya . " Yet again , someone was trying to play me . So yet again ... We play for blood . You keep what you kill , Riddick ! You keep what you kill ! Somewhere along the way , I lost a step , I got sloppy , dulled my own edge . Maybe I went and did the worst crime of all . I got civilized . So now , let 's zero the clock . Just me and this no-name world . I gotta find my animal side again . Before long ... I realized there was a whole another world over there . With water , grass , and life . I just had one thing in my way . Come on , show me some teeth . Escape artist , huh ? What do you got , old friend ? I thought we shared everything . Drop it . Stay here . EMERGENCY BEACON ACTUATOR . Bounty hunter . Wait . Wait . Steady . Okay , now . Sounds good . Hmmm ... All yours . It says " Dog Food " on it . If you could read this . Come on . All right , bring me my reserve . Where 's yours ? Rain . It 's a good thing . Just because you 've never seen before , it doesn 't mean it 's a bad thing . Looks like our time is up here . EMERGENCY BEACON ACTUATOR . Scanning ... Emergency beacon activated at mercenary station P7 . One person found alive ... Identified as Richard B. Riddick , escaped convict , murderer ... Bounty doubled if returned dead . Nothing . Look again , Diaz . Leave one ship and go , or DIE HERE . Somebody should teach this Riddick asshole , how to count . " Leave one ship ? " Like we got a fucking spare laying around ? Let 's crank it up . Good morning , Cyclops . Hey , Luna ? Yeah . Wake her up , kick her out of bed . What do you mean ? We 're running heavy . - She 's a prisoner . Wouldn 't she gonna be ... - We 're running big now . Okay ? Cut that 60 kilos loose . - Get away ! Get away from me ! - Stop ! Stop ! What do you want now ? I 'm gonna take off the restraints . Okay ? - I don 't want ' em off . - No , it 's not like that . Nobody 's gonna touch you now . Santana 's head has enough stuff now . Your lucky day . Get away from me ! What planet is this ? Where are we ? Sky and water , that 's all you gotta know . - I mean , how am I supposed to survive in there ? - Just go ... Before he changes his mind . I was getting attached to her . Now , where 's my box at ? My name is Santana ... Shot caller for this crew right here . I 'm the guy who knows all , sees all , beats all . - Spitting in kinda strong , don 't you think ? - And maybe just ball your mother while I 'm at it right here . Gotta bait the trap . I 've come all this way , to collect your head in a box ! Right here ! So have yourself a fine day now , Mr. Richard B. Riddick . I suspect , it would be one of your very last . Yeah , well , who need to agitate Riddick any more than ... you know . Any more than bringing his head back in a box would ? Shit . Here comes the neighborhood . Small world . Unidentified vessel , this is " Clan Vagos " out of Ursa 5 . Be advised that we are on the ground now , and have responded to emergency signal . No distress found , no need to land . I repeat , there is no reason for you to land at this location at this time . It appears , no reason for you to land at this location at this time . What the fuck did I just say ? Leave one ship and go , or DIE HERE . It 's a long haul , we can take out some water . Wouldn 't mind a little true-gravity time here . Like I was saying . I got this . You know who that was , right ? On the emergency beacon ? Wouldn 't be here if I didn 't . The concept of back-up , still has no appeal to you ? My besties here , can ball with anyone . No disrespect for your crew , of course , who ... look strong too in those matchy-matchy outfits . Shit . Didn 't know there was a dress code . Yeah , right . Well , it wasn 't in my intention to jump another man 's claim . But if you don 't mind , maybe we 'll just pull off a chair and spectate for awhile . What if I do ? Well , this is a co-op station , and also open to all mercs . - By the way , my name 's ... - " Too Late . " That 's your name . " Too Late . " And I don 't need you stepping all over my dick here , my friend . Well , I tell you what . I won 't lift a finger to help , until you come and ask me for it . How is that ? I was scoping this everywhere . It 's a cave system , 5 clicks south . It might be worth a look . Hey , Too Late . Need to pull a node from your ship , and store it right here next to mine , okay ? Oh , really . Why is that ? Riddick triggered the beacon to get off world , right ? Basically ... he was calling a taxi . And ... And a ship would make a sweet trap , right ? Confined space , metal walls , jail cell . It 's cool , huh ? Is it true ? Half the people you meet are below average intelligence ? Gotta make sure the ships stays grounded when he comes for them , okay ? Come on . Dahl . Pull a node from the ship . I 'll do it ... Warning : Explosive detonates outwards . Anytime now Riddick . I 'm telling you , this is total overkill . What ? Eleven of us out here now ? It should 've been a four man hunt , tops . You 're jinxing our janx , man . And that ain 't cool . Hey , I don 't give a shit what they say . He 's one guy ! Whatever you say , man . He 's one guy . So I guess that 's what passes for a fucking moon on this planet . It will be a dark night . Advantage him . Maybe he 's gonna wear you down first . Force you to go without sleep . Can 't you see I 'm busy ? - I 'm just sharing my thoughts . - Well . Now that you have . Can I politely invite you to step off my fucking porch ? I 'll start rotating down . But you let me know , huh ? As soon as I have his head in a box , I will let you know . Grid 29D . Stand by , stand by ... Whatcha got , cuzz ? Some dingo-dongo thing . Yeah . I see it now . - You want me to pop it ? - Knock it down . One shot , suppressed . Nice work , Diaz . Encouraging . I got something in my eye . It 's called " a scope . " Try it next time . You got this , right ? Will you get off my freaking frequency ? What the fuck is going on here ? - About fucking time ! - Fugoff ! Rubio , coming your way now . Gotta swap out a bad sensor . What was here versus what was found . How 's it square ? Pretty good , I mean , the morphine 's gone , but that 's always the first thing to go . That one look weird , though . " A predator restraint with 42-inch offset jaws ? " Six listed , zero found . That is an odd thing to go for a walk . Yeah , but Boss , you know how shit goes missing from these stations . One bad year , guys are ripping jaw for salvage . Hey , Santana ... You did sweep the area before I got here , right ? Sweep for what ? I just wanna make sure no one is setting traps for us . Five-Q . You understand what I 'm saying ? Traps ? What kind of traps ? The kind with jaws . Don 't touch that fucking thing ! What ? Up armor . Shit ! Ready ! Ready ! Stay put , stay put , stay put , stay put ! Rubio ... Who the hell was that screaming ? And why ? Nunez , break out the sweep gear ... and figure out how many of these big-ass traps we got out here , okay ? I 'm thinking maybe the whole upper left quad is some kinda fucking minefield . You gotta do that now , okay , Nunez ? Copy that , Nunez ? Nunez ? This is bad . This is very bad . Nunez ? Nunez ? Shut the fuck up , puto ... His radio just crapped out . Someone get eyes on him . I show him right where he should be , 13H . Go , go , go ! Right here . 13H , he 's supposed to be right fucking ... So this was overkill , huh ? Eleven of us , too many , yeah . You knew all about Riddick , right ? Well , maybe , you need to take that shit back ! Take the jinx off our janx , you understand me ? That 's what you need to do , Falco . You need to unjinxelate our fucking janx ! Aw , don 't mess with me now . Hey , hey . What was with you ? - Get back ! - It 's me ! It 's me ! He 's got Falco ! Jock up but you stay in home . No one 's going out there , until I say so . Man down , man down ! He got Falco ... How the fuck did he do that ? Never ever saw him , man ! He was right here and I never ... What about the ships ? Is he ... He 's not coming for the ships , he 's coming for fucking us ! Just fucking shoot ! Shoot ! Shoot ! One night , three dead . Not sure I 'm loving this trend . Two dead , one missing . - Exactly . Three dead . - Well ... Look at it this way , boys . We might all fit on one ship now . Diaz ! Get those other traps back there . Luna , say something Bible like over these bodies . Okay . Maybe we zero this out . What 's your tag , anyway ? So now , you wanna know my name . Well , I 'm not sure I 'm gonna say . Because everyone you know by name , Santana , winds up dead . You gonna clean this shit up ? Shut your mouth , fucking bitch . - Excuse me . - Wow . Watch out for surprise attacks . Maybe ... Maybe it 's time to start merging assets , right ? So this is your way asking for my help ? This is me saying that I may need some of your gear . and if some of your guys happen to come attached to that gear , I will understand , that 's the way it 's gotta be . So you 're asking for my " gear 's " help ? More like that . Moss ? Gear say " nah , " bitch . Here 's your answer . What the fuck do you want , man ? You know what ? I 'm gonna fold you in , Santana . But I give orders to Dahl , Dahl gonna give the orders to you . Now that 's the chain of command from this point forward . Why I 'm not loving this plan so far ? Aw , I know , I know . You know why ? Because it sucks ass and swallows ! I 'm not taking orders from your pet whore , who thinks I won 't smack her right back in the ... I don 't fuck guys . Occasionally , I fuck ' em up if they need it . Here 's what 's gonna happen , Santana , you need to take a back seat , We 'll track Riddick down , I promise . But I want him alive . You give me a day , and after that , he 's yours to kill . You 're giving me the bounty ? You pay my crew , fuel costs . The rest is yours . That 's the deal . What is Riddick for you ? Not just some convict . What do you want ? Why are you here ? Who are you ? My name is Johns . Lock down those ships . Get those hogs on deck . I will ride with Moss and Lockspur . I wanna non-lethal load-out , L.O.D.s and phosphor frags to start with . This is a man that hunts by night , we 'll take it to him by day . Diaz ! Vargas ! Show me the spot of the last kill . Some kinda canine . Hey , Diaz , I got a dog here . Is it the same dingo dongo thing from last night ? No , I 'm pretty sure we killed that one . It could be the same one . The same . Dahl , get the sniper rifle and barium rounds , now . 1500 meters . Could be just the first hole it found . A stressed animal is gonna run to ground it knows . Besides ... I 'm getting human pheromones . FURYA Riddick ! Let ' em down ! He 's down already ! Down ! Down ! Santana 's guy . - Falco . - Shit , we just killed a hostage . I 've been knowing him already for 10 years . The concept of a hostage , has no appeal to him . Falco was already dead . This is just some fucking side show , to buy more time . What the fuck , man ? Just drop some mud right there . So , if Riddick isn 't here ... Dahl . Dahl , Do you copy ? Does anyone copy ? Dahl , are you there ? Were you just perving out on me , somehow ? May all your dreams come true , baby . You got two minutes . I want you out on fucking watch . Luna ? Don 't watch me , watch my back . What you 're here for ? Take two steps forward . Two . Remember , he could be anywhere . This is Johns to any goddamn body at the station ! I want you to keep an eye on that locker ! Keep an eye on the nodes ! Riddick may have made an end run . My E.T.A. is 7 minutes . But watch your back ! Thank you for being a bitch . Your two minutes are up . You gonna do what I tell you to do ? Rumor is Riddick might be in the vicinity . I thought I should just check on the locker . Get outside , get on your optics , and get after this fucker ! You 're not gonna find him here ! Actually , Dahl , I think we have something in common . I don 't fuck guys either . You need to see this . FAIR TRADE . He wrote that ? He took our deep space communications . All of it . Then who 's blood is that ? There ? Here ? Over there ? I had to kick his ass again . Sorry . Not really . Fuck that . Let 's take a look into this . Stop . That key leave your neck ? Never . Well , the only reason to write " Fair Trade " , is if he got into that locker and took something out . Something that we need . Like a power node . Which he can then swap for something he needs . All that ? Wow . Highly unlikely . Which one you fucking lost me , Santana ? Here 's what I 'm saying ... If he did get in there , somehow , he was in a position to relock it , and change the code . Could be entering the wrong shit , Santana . So ... do you think , sometime during the last few hours , he got this off my neck without me noticing , did whatever he did , put the fucking key back on my fucking neck , without me fuckin ' noticing ? Is that what you 're saying ? Where did you get that theory from ? A unicorn 's ass ? There 's a reason he is who he is . He 's a convict . Not some Zulu warlock . If you know what you doing . This is crazy ! This is fucking crazy ! The first three clicks were good ! It did not go off ! You can get three clicks in Russian Roulette . Don 't mean you get four , mother fucker ! You know what , Santana ? For once I actually agree with you . - I think you 're good . - Shut up . - You ? Do you think we 're good ? - Yeah . I think you 're good , cuzz . You 're fucking good , just butch up . - Sounds like your department , lesbo . - I 'm not opening that thing . - Oh , yes , you fucking are ! - I 'm so fucking not ! Hey , hey , hey ! Use your fucking brains ! We 're not gonna do Riddick 's work for him ! Put your weapons down ! And have a look at that ! He was here ! Right fucking there ! Santana , put your fucking sword away . Don 't fucking open it , then . Well , the problem is that , Santana , if we never open that locker ... we never leave . O Mother of my salvation , whom shall I fear ? Protecting my life , I shall not be afraid . - Four ! - Continue . Five ! And ... Oops ! Wish I had thought of that . Six ! Six ! Six . You are a shitstorm trooper , Santana . I give you that . - You 've beaten Dahl this time . - I couldn 't actually think even , he can do that . This is a sign . Sweets . I believe this is a sign . It may be that the good Lord wants us to take these nodes , and flee this planet just as soon as we can . That 's my good luck charm . Wrong business , kid . Yeah , it was kinda like a bomb . So we sealed up these caves with some phosphors right here . So he can 't go back . But just like an animal , he 's gonna head to neutral ground . What we gonna find , he 's got three or four grounds out there . So we radius out from this point , here ... We need radio that counts . I saw three repeaters listed in the inventory . Find them . Set ' em up at regular methods . I need you to warn the others to join our communications . Are you scared of me ? Yeah . Are they scared of me ? Yes , they 're scared of you . Maybe you 're all scared of the wrong thing . Lockspur , we should lock down those hogs , all right ? I don 't want this guy anymore mobile than he already is . And Dahl , I spotted a nice den , fits for you . Right here , within these little hills . Moss ? I just saw him . Say again . I just saw him . Dahl , I want you to sit on this ship ! Diaz , make sure your ship is locked , and the rest of you ... get on the fucking perimeter and keep your eyes on each other ! Santana , he got the fucking nodes ! I know . It 's coming . So then we just combine nodes . Pull one from that ship , put it in this ship , you know . Amps is amps , right ? It 's not about amps , it 's about what each ship is rated to handle . You miss by even a few milli-joules and you fry every chip you got . Okay , so figure out the different and just do it . Jailbreak the fucking thing ! I could give you a crash course , on thermodynamic equilibrium and energy exchange right now , - or maybe you just wanna take my Goddamn word for ... - - I get it , I get it . The ships are incompatible and are not gonna fly without the nodes back . Why do I feel like we just cut off our own nuts here ? Probably because we did . How about I take one of those jet hogs , two days worth of food , and go and hunt this fucker down myself ? Bad idea , Diaz . One on one with Riddick ? I might be able to get the emergency beacon working again . That 's like an ambulance calling for an ambulance , isn 't it ? It 's backup for the fucking backup , we can 't . And I thought he was the one stranded here . Ah , well , looks like you thought wrong . Long waiting for backup ! In case you were thinking about fixing the beacon and calling for help . Falco 's reading . Riddick . I don 't give a fuck about the backup . And I still got all kinds of gear , that could ruin your day in a hurry . So you go find another fucking cave . You keep running , you keep hiding , it doesn 't matter to me none . 'Cuz in the end , I will find you ! Look south . I don 't believe it . Big balls on this fucking guy ! Dahl , keep an eye on things here . - What should I do ? - Stay low . Let 's go . Come on . Both of you , drop . So , what 's the bounty you get ? I don 't know . I don 't care . It 's not why I 'm here . I bet the big gimoke knows . Yeah . I know exactly what it is . What I do know , is that it 's double if you 're brought back dead . That 's new . Will it be enough to pay for your funerals ? What I 'm interested in ... is a little backwater place with a system-code of " M-344 / G. " And I wanna know what happen there 10 years ago . You 're the Father . - Bid daddy Johns . - Yeah , that 's right . And you traveled all this way , just to see me ? I 'm flattered . It 's kinda strange , not knowing what to put down in the family Bible . It 's kinda strange , three guys have to die just so you really can ... No , no , no . You don 't get to put that shit on me . Those kills are on you . I have a feeling that 's not the only thing on me right now . Okay , you 've got barium shells , stab-shock , explosive tip . What do you want ? Barium or stab-shock ? - Horse tranq . - Okay . I hate to interrupt this discussion , about ancient history . But maybe I should step in right here , and introduce myself . - My name is ... - Box Boy . Say what ? You 're the guy who said that he was gonna put my head in a box . Right ? Well , That was me ... spitting noise . - But you have a box . - Do I have a box ? Thought I saw one . I mean , of course I 've got a box . Everyone 's got a box , man . Even Diaz has a fucking huge box . Good . We 're gonna use it . Three down , eight left . And normally , I just keep going . Six down . Nine down . You get where I 'm going with this . But things are changing here , and nobody wants to be on this planet 24 hours from now . So I suggest we make a work . What do you want ? A " gentleman 's agreement ? " I leave one node out in the open . You take it . The other node and the other ship are mine . Hey , wait , wait , wait ! What 're we playing here ? Retard Bingo ? Or what ? That was on the table from the start , man . Forget the start ! It 's the end you wanna think about now . See that ? I 'll give you until that rain hits that station . That 's your clock . Box Boy ! Dahl ! Do it now ! Now ! Again ! He 's not going down . Do it again , Dahl ! Just go down . I got this , Dahl . Riddick . Riddick . Johns . We beat ' em in the chains now ? Okay , from the beginning . For the historical record . The Hunter Gratzner . That 's the commercial vessel , my son uses to transport you back to slam . But that ship ... sends a distress call somewhere near M-344 / G , It 's a backwater system with two suns and one habitable planet . Does he survive the crash ? Big drama , next few hours . But whatever happens . No matter what they tell you ... Don 't let them take these chains off me . " Them ? " Who 's " them " ? Who you 're talking ... ? Do you even know who you 're talking to here ? That was for me ? - When the chains come off , Box Boy . - Jesus christ . You go in the first five seconds . Really ? And you plan on killing me with what ? Your mouth ? - With that shiny blade . - I 'd love to see you try . For the historical record . He made it . It was just you and him ? It was ... It was the same number you see here in this room . So how many made it off ? Three . But not him . No . So between the time of the crash and the time you leave that planet , my son dies . Then I can safely assume it 's at your hands . Is that right ? I 'm wasting my fucking time here ! Granting your last wishes ? I was refering to you . Not that the chains aren 't a hot look ? But no . I 'm not gonna straddle you in front of all these guys . What if I killed all of them first ? Easy boy . There 's a lot more tranq where that came from . Tell me what you see outside that window , Dahl . The Cyclops unit . Two ships . A couple dead guys in plastic . - And you don 't see anything else ? - Nothing else . Let me know if you do . Love those toenails , by the way . Yeah ? " Predator Pink . " Matches your nipples . Why are we even listening to this big fuck stick ? Can we just detach his head , please ? Here 's what 's gonna happen . In the next 60 seconds , you 're gonna watch your own head drop into that box . And nothing ... Nothing 's going to keep you from that special place at Hell . But maybe in the last minute of your life you wanna be something more ... than a Goddamn savage ! Gimme some fucking answers ! Please ! Is there anything , you like to add on the subject I just raised ? Time 's up . Time is up . He 's all yours . Hold him down . Finale partido , amigo . More dingo-dongos , maybe . You lucky . I know what 's coming . Called to find you . The serpents . Spotlight ! Like I said . It ain 't me you gotta worry about . What is it ? What 's out there ? I don 't know . Fuck that . There 's something out there . It ain 't right . And it 's coming our way . Whoever they are , they ain 't so hard to kill . What the fuck ? Fuck ! No more holes , please . Now here 's what 's gonna happen . In 60 seconds , you 're gonna take these chains off me . We 're gonna make a play to those nodes , and get off this rock . But somewhere along the line , when it gets really bad , Johns , he 's gonna fold , just like little Johns did . Then , when it 's all over , and the rest of you are waiting for a dead animal to pick up . I 'm gonna go balls deep into Dahl . But only because she asked me to , sweet-like . What does he mean with , " things go bad ? " What ? This doesn 't qualify as " bad " ? What the fuck is happening ? How fucked are we ? Who knows how long it 'll rain ? Or how many of those things are buried out there ? He saw it . He saw it with those eyes of his and he didn 't tell us what . One ship for you , one for me . I need to know if these nodes are retrievable . And I need to know we have a deal . We got a deal . The chains stay on . Why do we settle this for them ? Okay , okay . Up , up , up , up , up ... Good doggy . Holy shit ! Yeah . Let 's cut him loose . That was " five seconds " . I like to be a man of my word . How about you , Johns ? For he shall give his angels charge over me , to keep me ... - Shut the noise , Luna . - in all thy ways , as long as I lived . - Luna . - I think the angels are here . Protecting me . And if they 're here , watching over me , and maybe they 'll deliver us all ... You 're the last thing we need creeping us out . I got something ! Shut the fuck up ! You shut the fuck up , Vargas ! Leave the kid alone ! Where the hell did that come from ? Jesus christ ! Oh , no , no , no ! What the fuck is wrong with you , you crazy bastard ? You could 've kill me ! I got it , didn 't I ? Vargas , get up . Vargas , get up . Come on , let 's go . Vargas , come on , man . Walk it up , let 's go . It 's just a little one . Small ones are the worst . They save the most venom . Hey , kid . Leave God out of this . He wants no part of what happens next . I forgot to mention ... is no weapons for you . Do you think you can run in one of these things ? I 'll run it , like I stole it . I 'll take flank . If Riddick comes up back here without us , you go ahead , you kill him on general principle . Is that before or after I 'm supposed to fuck him ? You asshole motherfucker ! Just sitting here watching ... Would 've covered you . But you said " No Weapons . " How bad you want those nodes , Johns ? Yeah , I don 't suppose you took the time to do this for him , huh ? This may come as a shock to you , Johns , but I didn 't ghost your son . He seemed set on killing himself . What 's the fuck does that mean ? Morphine ! Your son liked his morphine . Liked it twice a day . You didn 't know your son was a junkie ? Your Johns was like most mercs . They look all stand up , and do right , till you cut ' em open , and you find something missing . In his case , a spine . I don 't have to listen to this shit , that 's not the man I knew . Then you didn 't know your son . He wanted to kill a kid . To save his own skin . I had a problem with that . You expect me to believe ... that my son was gonna kill a child , to save his own life ? Morphine makes your brain soft , your heart lose it . I don 't fucking buy it . I just can 't believe that my son was the bad guy , in this fucking demented fairy tale of yours ! No reason to lie now . Johns . Either one of us . Thanks for starting killing those people for me , Riddick . But I 'll take it from here . Gimoke ! So that blade you buried was meant for me ? Anyone who deserved it , really . We got a problem , Riddick . 'Cuz I got two nodes here . We got one hog . And I sure as shit , I 'm not riding bitch with you again . One hog ? You sure about that , Johns ? He pulled the Goddamn turbine pin ! You just figured that out ? Diaz was gonna take the nodes for himself and ghost me . He 's gonna leave you out here alone . So , what now ? Now we switch to our ground game . And see if that lack of spine runs in the family . Reload ! Watch your head ! Go ! I got inbound . Take this ! Is it just you ? Just slam this thing , and see if it 's still good . Boss ... Just see if the fucking thing works , we need to get out of here ! Extraction . 30 seconds or less . Let 's go , let 's go ! lemme ask you something ... sweet like ... Lotta good men died here , Riddick . Not sure I 'm supposed to overlook that . Next time . Yeah , things would 've been different , if they weren 't trying to put my head in a box . So where to now , Riddick ? You know , fuck that . Don 't tell me . I don 't wanna know . I 'll tell you this , Johns . Sooner or later , we all have to head home . Tell Dahl to keep it warm for me . And Johns ... You keep a strong spine .

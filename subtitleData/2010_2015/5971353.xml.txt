 Big boy , this is little boy . How 'd things go down at the chicken coop ? Weigh station inspector needs to learn some adult words and a bit of hygiene , but he waved us through . The cargo is secure . Looks like a clean shot from here . Roger that . Little girl will take point on your front door . See you at the drop stop , Mack . I 'm clear . Son of a bitch . You see that ? Little girl is down . Escort Two is down . I know , Sherlock ! What the hell hit us ? We need to go to alt two , alt two . Nothing over our shoulder . Back door is clear . Protect the cargo at all costs . S.H.I.E.L.D. region C.T. , this is Agent Mack . We are under attack from an unseen I-don 't-know-what . Agent Mack , advise nature of threat . Over . What in the holy name of ... S.H.I.E.L.D. region C.T ... Oh , hell , I can 't explain . Oh , no ! Agent Mack , come in . Are you there , Agent Mack ? Are we there yet ? You know you 're late . I 'm tired . From the morning 's workout . I thought I was joining S.H.I.E.L.D. , not 24-Hour Fitness . It 's called relative strength training . Starting with the basics . And next time , you do 15 pushups for every minute you 're late . Fine , Mister Fun-Machine . Better than pull-ups . I don 't ever wanna do another pull-up again . You find yourself hanging off the edge of a building 20 stories up , you 're gonna wanna do at least one . Stand here . Jab , cross . Like this . Ten minutes . You know the hardest part about boxing ? Getting punched in the face ? Keeping your hands up . Why do I even have to do this ? I 'm sure Fitz-Simmons' supervising officer didn 't make them do this muscle stuff . You said you wanted to be a field agent like Coulson . Well , if you 'd like to switch disciplines ... Hey , Simmons , what did your S.O. give you guys for morning drills ? Oh , atomistic attribute drills . Yeah , we 'd name the mechanical , chemical , thermal ... Electrical properties of materials ... Okay , okay , they made your point . There will come a moment when you have to commit to this , or bail . Every field agent has a defining moment . Ask Coulson . When you have to make the hard call . To either dedicate yourself to this , or to curl up in a ball and run . How can you run if you 're curled up in a ball ? It 's my job as your S.O. to make sure you don 't die before then . Come on . So what was yours , Agent Ward ? Ten minutes . Your defining moment . Come on , tell me . I wanna know . I could get Coulson to give you some of that truth serum . You could spill your little heart out to me again . You mean my Level 1 overshare that miraculously got you to cooperate ? I hate to tell you this , rookie , but we don 't have a truth serum . Changing course . Briefing in three . Ah . Looks like we 're on the move . S.H.I.E.L.D. 616 with new orders , set for Colorado airfield , north . A few minutes ago a S.H.I.E.L.D. transport was attacked while carrying a priority red protected asset , off Route 76 near Sterling . Priority red ? The asset was Canadian physicist Dr. Franklin Hall , known for his work ... - Oh , no , not Frank . - Doctor Hall ? He was our chemical kinetics advisor our second year . Yeah , he 's so enthusiastic about science , we just adored him . We can rescue him , can 't we ? He 's one of ours . We 're gonna try . And the attackers ? Invisible . Wait , invisible ? Cool . But terrible . Doctor Hall was an asset ? One of a few select scientists S.H.I.E.L.D. has been protecting . People our enemies would love to get their hands on . We keep them hidden , keep them on the move . Which is why Fitz and I were so lucky to have him . We don 't have him anymore . And what does priority red mean ? It means security should 've been ... heavy . It was pretty damn scary . And I don 't spook easily , boss . Nothing in the air ? From above ? And nothing over our shoulder . But what 's scary is , they knew our route . They were waiting for us . Are you saying they were working with somebody inside S.H.I.E.L.D. ? Sorry to say , it had to be . Fitz , what am I seeing here ? Well , I 'm not wearing the full-spectrum goggles I designed , so , no clue . Let me have a look . No , whoa , whoa , whoa , wait ! Don 't move . Wait a second . What the hell ? I think the eiectro-static field scanner activated some ... thing . Okay . Can we deactivate it ? Now ? - You have to increase the density ! - I tried , Fitz ! Fitz ! Whoa ! That did all this . What is that ? Something big . Either someone cracked our comm system , or Doctor Hall 's movements leaked from inside S.H.I.E.L.D. You really think we have a mole ? I think you should go through the communication logs . Rule it out . We 'll work the tractor tread that we found on the scene . I can do that . Instead of pull-ups . I can upload the image of the tread pattern and check to see if there 's any ... Already done . Matched it to a 2010 model . Found a list of purchasers within 500-mile radius , narrowed down to those with priors , financial troubles , or a propensity for risk-taking . Three suspects . Who may have sold their construction equipment to the kidnappers . We 'll ask . Hey . So , Ward said a funny thing . He said that you guys don 't have a truth serum . Did he ? Ward said that ? - Yeah . - interesting . Yeah . Hey , wait , but ... I ... Hey . Do you want me to bench press this ? Read it . Every communication out of HQ since they decided to transfer Doctor Hall . Hang in there , Doc . It 's gonna be a while . Excuse me . The hell are you ? A concerned citizen , who happens to be a member of a giant bureaucratic organization that 's tracking your every move . I haven 't done anything wrong . Of course not . But you sold your excavator to some people who did . And you 're hiding out here until things cool down because you know it . I just wanna know who paid you . They paid me enough not to answer any questions like that . Feels like the Old West . They gave me money for my equipment , that 's all . I never saw a face and I never heard a name . And how did you receive this money ? They write you a check ? Paid you in gold ? Now it really feels like the Old West . It looks like this because it 's a dore bar . It means it was made at the mine rather than in a refinery . It 's only about 92 % pure . The cowboy got cheated a bit . Can you determine the mine based on the impurities ? Oh , yeah , yeah , yeah . We 've done that already . It 's from the Dacey Mine in Tanzania . - Hmm . - Which is owned by ... Quinn Worldwide . I 'm sure you studied the CEO in your chemical engineering classes , or saw him on the cover of Forbes . Ian Quinn . We can 't just pluck it from the ground like a potato . It needs to be extracted from the ore and enriched . I know . You know , tell him this investment paid for that ridiculous yacht of his , and that he 'll thank me at the shareholders ' meeting . Why is he tied up ? Quinn . Does he look like a threat ? I 'm sorry about these guys . Welcome to Malta , Frank . You know , it 's one thing to steal my ideas , Ian , but stealing me ? First of all , I never stole your ideas . We 've always agreed information should be free . It 's amazing how much money you made off free information . And secondly , think of this as a rescue mission , Frank . In fact , in a moment I think you 'll be thanking me . My staff intercepted a communication about the movement of a certain asset , and then when I deduced that asset was you , I couldn 't pass up on the opportunity . It 's a little out of my comfort zone , sure . Malta . You 're not stupid . S.H.I.E.L.D. can 't come after you here . Not just S.H.I.E.L.D. I am now a naturalized citizen of this fair country . Stunning beaches , beautiful tax laws , and a deep-seated hatred of outside forces telling them what to do . Sounds like your dating profile . Right . I moved my entire operation down here . Bought the old prime minister 's estate . It 's not really my style , but they had this huge underground facility , so I figured , hey . Always been a stubborn bastard . And now you 've finally found a place where the watchdogs can 't touch you . Not without breaking international law . Ah ! But more importantly , old friend , they can 't touch you . Recognize the design ? We were barely old enough to drink when you sketched the blueprint . That 's just a miniature prototype . A theoretical machine powered by a theoretical substance . Frank , you were right . You found it ? Gravitonium . It 's an extremely rare , high-atomic numbered element that powers the device . So extremely rare that most people didn 't believe it existed , much less the theory that an isolated positive charge ... Yeah , would turn the flow from isotropic ... Guys ? High school dropout here . How does the device work again ? Well , gravitonium distorts gravity fields within itself , causing an undulating , amorphous shape . Which causes these , um , wiggly bits here . But when an electric current is applied , the gravitonium solidifies . And those gravity fields erupt , randomly changing the rules of gravity around it . Well , so , now you can imagine what would happen to a big rig at 100 kilometers per hour . Or you ... Well , you could just remember , 'cause we saw it already , didn 't we ? Yeah , and guess which genius published every theory about gravitonium , and possible applications ? Years ago . - Doctor Franklin Hall . - Correct . And Dr. Hall attended the University of Cambridge at the same time as Ian Quinn . Coulson may be off on this . Quinn is a notoriously good guy . His charity endowment 's something like $ 8 billion . Yes . With money made from leeching the Earth of its resources . Looks like he 's dug up another . Twenty years , 12 mines , six continents . But , yes , I finally found it . And now , we get to play with it . Do you remember , in all our talks on Orchard Street , the part where it 's very , very dangerous ? Everything powerful is dangerous . But I 'm not gonna convince you with more talk . Talk of 50 % shares , talk of Nobel Prizes . No , not you . You will just have to see it . I built the full-size generator , but I need you to tell me how to control the gravity fields . You can complete your life 's work . I plan to do this with or without you , but I know you . I know you 'd want it done right . Now 's the moment when you thank me . The man 's a prisoner , and it 's up to us to get him out . We 've checked the specs . There 's no way into Quinn 's compound without a large S.H.I.E.L.D. strike force . Or a man inside . He 's got neodymium laser fencing surrounding the property . They 'll never allow a strike force into Malta . Plus , this weekend Quinn Worldwide 's got its annual shareholders ' gathering . We 'd risk global outrage . But ... if we go in alone ... S.H.I.E.L.D. can disavow us , claim ignorance . Without a man inside , it 's impossible . Unless you 're immune to pulse laser emissions . If we had a monkey we could get in . Oh , Fitz ! If we had a small monkey , he could slip through the sensors and disable the fence 's power source with his adorable little hands . I could go in . Drop me in the hills outside of Valletta . I 'll spend a few weeks establishing a cover , gathering intel ... Hall doesn 't have a few weeks . And to restate , any agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. caught on Maltese soil can be shot to death with bullets . - Yeah . - Legally . Not me . I could go in . Skye , this is serious . Wait . What are you saying ? Well , I 'm not an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. , so I can go in without breaking all these stupid rules . International laws . This isn 't something the Rising Tide can hack , Skye . Did you hear the deadly lasers part ? Without a brave monkey ... You said you could go in with a man inside . And you wanna be that man ? Fitz-Simmons love the guy , and he needs help . They could be torturing him . Or worse , making him do strength training . But you don 't have the background , or clearance , or experience with any of this . I know . But I 've got an invitation . Well , technically it 's an e-vite . I understand your concern , but we don 't have a lot of options . Hey , I 'm impressed . She just wrangled an invitation on her phone using insider back channel voodoo . In minutes . But sending her in with no training , you 're taking a huge risk . I know Director Fury felt he owed you after you sacrificed yourself ... And my card collection . He gave you some autonomy . But Skye on a covert op ? Are you worried about her safety or her loyalty ? Both . The Rising Tide is the reason she got an invite . Who knows how many protocols she violated . That 's her job . Ignore protocol , find connections and back doors that nobody else can see . Something else is bothering you . She 's holding back , sir . She says she wants to be an agent , but she won 't commit . She doesn 't listen , makes jokes . Were you hard on her ? Sure . I tried playing nice , too . I need a new strategy . Try no strategy . Stop thinking like an operative , start thinking like a person . Maybe Skye will let that person help her . Help her what ? Help her think like an operative . Now , again , slowly , what 's first ? And then ? Then things are moving too quickly . I 'm a proper Southern girl . You 'll make me untidy . Twist the thumb , palm the barrel . Ow . You 're gonna die and leave us hanging out to dry , you know that ? You 're going in with no self-defense skills ... I have a few tricks up my sleeve . You need muscle memory , fundamentals , the tools to turn yourself ... Into a whole bag of tools ? How did you learn computer science without committing yourself to it ? C.S. comes naturally to me . I 'm sorry I 'm not naturally whatever you are . You think this came naturally ? I had a brother who beat the crap out of me . Me and my little brother . For nothing . For eating a piece of his birthday cake . I had to learn to protect us , the way I am trying to protect you . That was my moment . You asked . Sorry . Didn 't mean to push . But I did manage to take this . Getting the gun is one thing . Pulling the trigger , that is another . Now , again , slowly . What 's first ? Skye will walk in the front door . The only external access point to Quinn 's underground facility is from a beach cove . A two-man extraction team could slip in there , but it 's not easy . Fitz-Simmons . The perimeter is surrounded by a 20-foot-high neodymium laser grid . Touch it and you 're toast . Dead toast . The only way to disable the grid is to crack the system and trigger a reboot . This would give the team three seconds to cross . Of course , Quinn 's too smart to allow any wireless access on his property . That 's where I come in . Yes . Working compact . Holds up under X-ray . Desert Rose , to match your complexion . But , oh , what 's this ? A readout , okay ? It turns green if you 're in close enough proximity to a computer to gain wireless access . And when it does , you just drop this nearby and walk out . We 'll do the rest . Easy as pie . Or it will be , if you stick to the plan . Got it . Plan . Green . Drop . Walk . Pie . I don 't wanna question your orders , sir . Good . But I 've already seen far more combat than I bargained for . This two-man extraction team ? That 's exactly the kind of action I was hoping to avoid . That 's why you 're not on it . Specialist work is different from field work , believe me . When was the last time you ... Hall 's one of ours and he 's in trouble . I need two men to get him out . Ward makes one . So that 's why I 'm going in . You forget , I saw plenty of action with the Avengers . And you died . All right , team . Suit up . Thank you . Hors d 'oeuvre , madame ? Who are you ? Apologies for his manners . He knows very little English . Oh . That 's ... Whatever . Skye . Qasim Zaghlul . Big fan . You built half of Dubai , including the Arabian Blade . I love that building . It 's super sci-fi . Where 's your wife ? Wife 's name 's Nadrah . Nadrah . Twin sons . She 's staying at home with the boys ? You know Nadrah ? - How 's she doing ? - She 's good . The pleasure is mine . I could get used to this , people . It 's like Siri , if it worked . Skipper to Bravo , I got eyes on Top Dog . The Eagle is landing on it . What are you doing ? Sorry . I don 't know . I see Quinn . I 'm gonna go talk to him . I mean , that , and its effect on the Industrial Average . - That was good . Yeah , right ? Ian Quinn . I 'm your last-minute party crasher . Skye . Oh . Wow . Great to meet you . This is Skye , a member of the Rising Tide . They 're a group of hackers that have gotten some pretty big secrets out to the public . I prefer " hacktivist " . I 'm glad you 've heard of our site . I read it . We think very much alike . More freedom of information , the less government infringing on everyone 's rights . I 'm a fan . That explains the invite . This is a tough party to get into . Not as hard to get into as the encrypted back channel you contacted us through to request the invite . That 's sort of where I live . You gotta show me how you did that . I mean , if you sign on . Sign what now ? I 've been known to turn a few black hats into white hats . Not just for vulnerability analysis , but for very creative thinking . Are you offering me a job ? Well , I didn 't invite you here for your pretty face . I didn 't know you had a pretty face . Yes , I wanna hire you , before someone else snatches you up . That seemed to go well . - Yeah . It did . Many of you shareholders have been with us for years , and I see a few new names here . But I wanna thank you all for traveling so far to this beautiful country . And , well , for slumming it at Shaba Tal-Banar . This country , where we are allowed to pursue progress and profit without the stranglehold of regulations that are now choking our world . The United States Government , the E.U. , the D.R.T.C. , S.H.I.E.L.D. These are just a few of the institutions that are guilty of halting the development of new technology for anyone except themselves . We dare defy them with a new idea , they steal in and sweep it out from under us . But not today . You are all aware of what Quinn Worldwide has been able to do with basic minerals , let alone uranium or plutonium , despite these unjust restrictions that weigh the scales in the other guys ' favor . Well , today I 'm announcing something new . An element that could balance those scales . And I mean that quite literally . Imagine if you could control gravity . If instead of drilling for oil , it rose up to greet you . Imagine if you could move a supertanker 's worth of cargo with a swipe of your hand . Well , we will do this and more . This could 've been a traumatic experience for Dr. Hall . He may not be the same when we find him , Ward . I 'll talk him down . We don 't want your personality to set him on edge . Great time for humor , sir . My people skills are the least of our problems if Skye can 't get us in . It 's locked , but there 's no lock . Check for a keypad . Nothing . Wait , you can hack a keypad ? No , not over the phone . Is there a reception desk ? Okay , yeah . Well , now what do I do ? What are you trying to do ? Just looking for a pen , here we go . Got to write down all those good ideas , you know what I mean ? Of course you know what I mean . You probably have , like , 10 pens for all your ideas . What are you really doing ? All right . I 'm busted . I was trying to get a glimpse behind your office door , see how things really operate . I invite you here as a guest , and you treat me like another corrupt institution , looking for trade secrets to leak online . - Security ... - No , no , no , wait . It 's just , with all these la-di-da people , you have to be so guarded . So careful . What you say , what secrets you reveal . And I was hoping that you and I could be honest with one another . If you know what I mean . My office had less space , more wheels . Wow . A view of the ocean and the pool . Not a bad place to do business . Got the dispatch leaking Hall 's location . User 's an alias . Oh ! Can you trace the D.H.C.P. server ... Trace is running , but it 'll take time . Our girl ? I thought she was done for , but she 's just sweet-talked her way into Quinn 's office . How 'd she manage that ? She probably just used her , um ... ... boobs . Ugh ! That 's the only ... Oh , my gosh , the signal 's dead . Fitz ! I didn 't . She must have ... Oh , Lord . Much better . I haven 't felt that someone 's - watching-my-every-move feeling since I failed my driver 's test . Do you wanna tell me what the hell 's going on ? S.H.I.E.L.D. got to you ? They picked me up in L.A. , I helped them in a crisis , and now they wanna recruit me . Of course they did . So I played along . Talk about inside info . I have a bunk on their plane . I 've been gathering intel , biding my time until I could become useful . I thought this qualified . Why would they trust you with a covert operation like this ? Something about S.H.I.E.L.D. not breaking international laws . They had no other options . Whereas I like to keep mine open . Next patrol any minute now . Skye 's offline . Repeat , we 've lost audio and vitals . Abort is not an option , but if she 's compromised ... She 's still our only way in to get to Dr. Hall . And we 're their only way out . The beach is all clear . Let 's move up the ridge . You 're saying they wanted to rope me in because I pose a genuine threat ? Yes . And fit their profile . - Profile ? - Sure . You 're a criminal , you have a warrant somewhere . Probably . Specialized skill set . I try to stay humble , but fail . No family . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to hit a nerve . But that is what these people do . S.H.I.E.L.D. They prey on fear , and loneliness , and desperation , and they offer a home to those who have no one else to turn to . But I can offer you something better . Damn ! A little rusty , I guess . Guys , clock 's ticking . Where 's Skye ? You stay with us , there 's no secrets , no lies and no agenda . You 're free to do what you do without Big Brother watching over you . But first you have to tell me exactly what agenda S.H.I.E.L.D. sent you in here with . Well , they wanted me to do whatever it takes to get in here . Get in here and ... Bat my eyes . Get you talking . - We 're in ! - She 's done it ! Fitz , you 're up . Oh , mother of all things . Move , move , move ! We have a man down . Hostiles on the east ridge . We need a reset here , Fitz . Fitz ! Saying his name repeatedly does not increase productivity . Okay , go . Or maybe it does . System rebooting in two , one ... NOW ! I 'll look for Dr. Hall down in the lab . I 'll get Skye . No , you can 't be the only angle . S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s thorough enough to know about me and my exploits . It takes more than a pretty face to disarm me . Sir , we have a security breach . Oh , the timing on that was perfect . Dr. Hall ? Agent Coulson . We have an exit strategy . S.H.I.E.L.D. ? Yes , sir . Let 's get you out of here . I 'm sorry , Mr. Coulson . I 'm right where I 'm supposed to be . I 'll be honest . Our strategy did not take into consideration you saying that . Oh , no . Look , I don 't know what Quinn is promising you , but ... - An opportunity . We can 't let Quinn have control of this . It 's too dangerous . We can 't let anyone have control of this . That 's why I 'm here . To bury it at the bottom of the ocean . With him . Coulson . The leak came from ... Dr. Hall . Yeah , I 'm getting that . All the petitions , embargoes in the world couldn 't stop Ian . He grows more powerful every day . And then I get word he 's found this . I 'm sorry , Mr. Coulson . I had to make a choice . Something tells me that wasn 't the off button . Guys , we need to talk . Lost you for a minute . We 're aware of the problem , sir . Hall wanted Quinn to kidnap him ? Yeah , why would he do that ? What is wrong with him ? Quinn built a gravity generator . Like the one we found but bigger . Hall knew Quinn would need him to control its raw power . But Hall just wanted to unleash it . The one we found was 2.5 centimeters in diameter . It stopped a semi . How big are we talking ? Twelve feet . It 'll definitely take down the entire compound . - It 'll sink the place . - No , it 'll do more than that . Work a solution . I 'll disconnect the power before things get ... crazy . They can 't help you . Soon it 'll reach an exponential acceleration state . I 'm sorry . My team 's here . Good people . Sworn to protect all mankind ? That 's what I 'm doing , I promise . Making things right . Don 't you get it ? S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s against everything you stand for . They 're Big Brother . Maybe . But they 're the nice big brother who stands up for his helpless little brother who was getting beat up because he ate a piece of cake that he wasn 't ... You know ... You kidnapped a person ! I set him free ! I saved him ! And I could 've saved you . This place is massive . Where am I heading ? Southwest corner . Ward , tell me you 've got things covered on the ground . I can 't do a damn thing from out here . I 'm working on it . Tell me what they 're doing ! Tell me what they 're doing . You have to talk . You have no other way out of this . You 're expendable to S.H.I.E.L.D. They sent you in here with nothing ... They taught me a few things . The kid 's got balls . Thanks . But , yuck . But do you have what it takes to pull the trigger ? Nope . Get her . Hall . We have to evacuate . Get the chopper . Now ! All I had to do to get access to Quinn 's lab was drop little clues , create a puzzle for him to solve . Quinn likes to feel smart . So you leaked your location . Why not try reasoning with him ? You can 't reason with an addict . And he 's addicted to exploiting opportunities . But he never gives a thought to the friends , ecosystems , future generations left ruined in his wake . Like Agents Fitz and Simmons ? Your former students ? I 've got them in my ear right now , telling me you 're not a bad guy . We could 've worked with you on this . S.H.I.E.L.D. ? S.H.I.E.L.D. is just as guilty of the same thing ! Experimentation without thought of consequence ! Your search for an unlimited power source brought an alien invasion . Fair point . This element is far too powerful for you , for him , for anyone . But I don 't have to tell you that . You 're feeling it now . Come here . No , no , please , please . Are you hurt ? Just follow my orders . I 'll get us out of here . I see the future , Mr. Coulson , and it 's a catastrophe . I just see a lot of people in trouble . Nothing . Fitz-Simmons ' ? I tried to cut the power . It 's still going . - You need to find a catalyst . - Find some sort of catalyst . Something to create a chemical reaction in the core . It 's not too late to do the right thing . Help me find a catalyst ... lam doing the right thing . A completely selfless act . I know that history never celebrates what didn 't happen . They 'll call this a tragedy . They won 't understand the good I did here . Killing innocent people ? Saving millions . We have to live with the choices we make . But sometimes we have to die with them , too . I understand . You made a hard call . Yes . Now I have to make mine . Say it back to me . Deepest level of the Fridge . Unmarked vault . No access granted . And no recorded entry . I don 't want it listed , I don 't want it flagged for The Slingshot . Anyone finds out , you 're responsible . And suffering . Understood ? Yes , sir . It 's what Hall would 've wanted . I used to have this down . Should be just muscle memory . You 're making a habit of it , sir . Trying . I guess I 'm a little rusty . Of these close calls , I mean . I don 't enjoy running back end . You want off the plane ? Go ahead . I want in . Reporting for combat , next time it 's up . You 're committed to the cause , or just watching my back ? Same thing . And you are a little rusty . You and your brothers . Where 'd you grow up ' ? Massachusetts . Mostly . A house ? You didn 't ? One house . The Brodys . I was nine . They sent me back to Saint Agnes after a month . Said I wasn 't a good fit . Foster parents . Your first ? My third . I had heard it before but ... this one was different . 'Cause you wanted them to like you . Bad . I called her " mom " once . Tried it out . Guess it wasn 't a good fit . Hoping for something and losing it hurts more than never hoping for anything . We won 't turn our back . Doesn 't matter . I made my choice . And I want this . Bad . And I know there 's a truth serum . Whatever you say , rookie .

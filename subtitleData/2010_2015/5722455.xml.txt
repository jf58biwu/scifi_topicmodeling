 Yes , I 'm listening . My name is not " Nem " , it is " Nam " . Namgoung Minsoo , shit . Namgoung is my name , my surname is Minsoo , asshole . For what ? If I don 't want to ? You want a smoke too , asshole ? It 's too good for shit like you . Get up . My daughter Yona . If I go , she goes too . One gate , two lumps of Kronole . Am I at fault ? Of course , I 'm only doing this for the Kronole . You 're the one who 's giving me this . Stop ! We 're getting closer . What are you doing ? Run ! Don 't look . Minister , are you okay ? I 'm okay . You can eat this too ? A train baby wouldn 't know about this . I grew up walking over it . This is located under the snow . It 's called earth . What is this ? It moves . Underground . What does this mean ? Look , you see that ? What ? There was a woman among them . She was the maid in the lead car . An Inuit . An Eskimo , actually . She knew all about the ice and snow . She believed she could survive outside . Quickly . Close the door . Take this . Kronole first ! Are you looking for trouble or something ? You got a problem with the gates ? Here , smoke a cigarette . You should be grateful . This is the world 's last cigarette . You tail section pig . Your story is so beautiful , Curtis . But I don 't want to open this door . You know what I want ? I want to open a door . But not this one . That one . That one that leads to the outside . We 've been sentenced here for 18 years . Everyone thinks it 's a wall . But it 's a fucking door . Open it and get us out of here . I know ... But maybe we can survive . You remember Yekaterina bridge ? When we got slaughtered with axes ? Every new year , I check something . We see the wreckage of a plane ... under the snow . For ten years the tail can barely be seen . But now I can see the fuselage and wings . There is less and less snow and ice . It melts . Snow becomes more fragile . It doesn 't take much to get rid of everything . Recently , you know what I saw ? Outside , there were ... Rain drops . I 'm wasting my breath telling you this . You don 't think I 'm right . Kronole is highly combustible . One spark , and boom ! Basically , it 's a fucking bomb . I don 't hoard these just to get high ... but to blow that gate . Matches , quickly . Give it to me ! Fire ! Blood ! Are you okay ? What ? What happened ? Get down . Yona ... We must open this door . You see those cables ? There are so many cables . Yona . Red , number 8 . No , 7 . Yona , the Kronole ! - Yona , stop ! - No . Stick the Kronole on the door . It 's done ! Curtis has the matches . Go get them ! Curtis ! The matches ! Light the fuse ! Dad ... dad ... Dad !

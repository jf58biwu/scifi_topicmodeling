 Hey , you ! Hey ! Listen , can we talk ? RORY ! No . Shut up ! I just got a question , that 's all ! You OK up there ? Yeah , fine . No problem ! - What are you doing ? - Helping the Doctor ? Um , it 's humming . Is that OK ? Yeah , it 's fine , we 're just entering conceptual space . Imagine a banana , or anything curved . Actually , don 't . It 's not curved OR like a banana . - Forget the banana ! - Er , is he helping you fly the TARDIS ? Detach servo-couplings 2 , 7 and 11 , like I showed you . How come he gets to have a go ? You never let me have a go . Er , Doctor , don 't . Seriously . I let her drive my car once . Yeah , to the END of the road ! Where , according to Amy , there was an unexpected house . Oh , he 's jealous , because I passed my test first time . - You cheated . You wore a skirt ! - I didn 't wear a skirt . - Well , that would have worked too . - No , no , I did wear a skirt . But it was any old skirt . - Have you ever seen Amy drive , Doctor ? - No ! Neither did her driving examiner . Actually ... It was this one . It was THIS skirt ! What was that ? RORY ? ! Did you drop a thermo-coupling ? S-sorry ... How did you do that ? I told you , " Don 't drop them " . I specifically mentioned not dropping . - I-it was my fault ... - Of course it wasn 't your fault . - It kind ... Kind of WAS her fault . - How can it be HER fault ? ! Because , it was my skirt , and my husband , and your glass floor ... - Oh , Rory . - Sorry . Well , we 've landed . Emergency materialisation . Should be fine . Should have dropped off in the safest space available . Doctor ? What 's happened ? Safest spot available . The TARDIS has materialised inside itself . - Is that supposed to happen ? - Take a guess . - No ? - That 's the one . Whoa , what are you doing ? ! I have absolutely no idea . OK ? That is a bit weird . That is actually pretty cool ! Oh , I 'm glad you 're entertained , Rory , now that we 're stuck here for all eternity , - at least you won 't be bored . - Wait . What , we 're STUCK ? The inside of the TARDIS is now joined the OUTSIDE of the TARDIS . Worse than a time loop , a space loop . Nothing can enter or leave this ship ever again . OK , kids . This is where it gets complicated . - Who the hell are you ? - I 'm you . From your future . Tell me exactly what 's happened . Well , the exterior shell of the TARDIS has drifted forwards in time . If you step into the box now , you step into the control floor a tiny bit in the past . - I don 't understand . - Neither do I. - But , you just said it ! - No , I 'm just repeating it . I 'm just remembering what I heard myself saying when I was standing where you are now , and repeating it . I 'm just repeating this too ! And this . And this . Uhh , I still don 't understand ! - You still don 't ! - OK . When did this Amy step inside the box ? We need to maintain the timeline . - Ah ! As soon as she 's slapped Rory . - OK ! Heh ! No ! WHY do I get slapped ? Because we have to stick to the established chain of events . One mistake , and the whole timeline could collapse ! We 'll end up with TWO Amy Ponds forever . And THEN , what would you do ? OK , you ! In to the police box , now ! - What , and then I become her ? - Yes ! Go , go , go ! - Do I REALLY look like that ? - Yeah ! Yeah , you do ! - I 'd give you a driving license . - I bet you would ! Oh ! This is how it all ends . Pond flirting with herself . True love , at last ! Oh ! Sorry Rory . - Absolutely NO problem at all ... - NOW Amy ! - What 's the first line ? - " OK , kids . This is where it gets complicated . " Gotcha ! - So , was that it ? Are we OK now ? - No , we 're still trapped . What are you doing ? You told us to get in the police box ! Well , from your point of view , you 're about to tell us to the police box , from OUR point of view , you just told us to get into the police box , which is ... Why we got in the police box , which is why we 're ... Here . - Do I have to remember all of that ? - Yeah , it sort of happens . - Hi ! - Hi ! Hey ! Stop that . You two . In . Police box . Now . Run ! - So , what now ? - You two ! Stay where you are ! - What are you doing ? - I 'm setting up a controlled temporal implosion . It 's the only way to reset the TARDIS . But unless I find exactly the right lever to control the implosion , we 're all gonna die ! You don 't know which lever ! ? No . But I 'm about to find out ... - The wibbly lever ! - The wibbly lever ! Thank you ! OK , we 're back in normal flight . The TARDIS is no longer inside itself . The localised time field is no longer about to implode and rip a hole in all causality . But just in case ... Pond , put some trousers on !

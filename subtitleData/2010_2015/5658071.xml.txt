 - Did he infect us ? - Are we going to die ? I 'm not sure what happened . Suddenly , Peter , Dr. Farragut , was on top of me . He held me down , put his mouth over mine , like some kind of animal . I 've never felt so violated . - I was choking . - I couldn 't bloody breathe . Like he was trying to smother me . What about the others ? What others ? There were three more in here with us . After the attack ... they ran . Where ? I don 't know . I need their names . - We have a containment issue . - I heard . I 've asked Hatake for a security team . We 're mounting a search . This place is huge . If we can 't maintain - a simple isolation protocol ... - There 's nothing simple about this . All right , let 's concentrate on what we do know . We know the virus is not airborne . - What are the victims saying ? - They 're saying that Peter engaged in some kind of oral contact . What , like a kiss or a bite ? More like an assault . The R-naught of the virus is now six . - Multiply that times our escapees ... - That 's 18 new cases we can look forward to . We 're not even sure Peter 's done yet . Jules , I need you to get started on the rats right away . We need to find out the rate of infection . Sarah , can you handle the isolation unit until Doreen checks in ? Yeah , absolutely . If you see any signs of acute viral syndrome ... Fever , sweats , rash , sore throat , nausea , vomiting , myalgia , arthralgia , lymphadenopathy ... Any of that . You get back into a Racal suit and you find me immediately . Dr. Farragut . Our three missing doctors , Tracey , Raver , and DeKlerk . No one has seen them since they fled the sunroom . Why does that not surprise me ? Can you tell me , then , if anyone 's tried to leave the base - in the last eight hours ? - No . Well , then we 'll have to do this the old-fashioned way . Major Balleseros and myself will go floor to floor , room by room . And if they refuse to cooperate ? Like your brother ? Let 's not forget he 's still out there . I 'll have to persuade them . I hope you can . But just in case , our security teams will carry stun batons and restraints . You 're going to try to win them over with force ? The safety of this base is my only concern . All right , I don 't agree with restraining people any more than you do , but let 's just find them first , see if we can convince them to do what 's best for the whole base . You 're gonna need my help with those escaped patients . Not as much as I need you in the lab . Rate of infection is secondary to containment . You know that . I 've been tracking infected patients for the past two years . I know how to talk to them . - This is not about your qualifications . - Then what is it about ? - Our lack of resources up here . - That 's bullshit . When was the last time you even left Atlanta ? Damn it , Jules , we cannot both be in charge . You 'll have to follow my lead on this . How long do we have to be in here ? A couple of weeks at most . A couple of weeks ? What about my research ? What if I 'm not infected ? I 'm in the same room with them . - We 're breathing the same air ... - Shut up , Bryce . Everybody , please calm down . I know this is very stressful . You don 't know anything . How old are you ? I 'm twenty-six . - You look like you 're 15 . - I have two master 's and a PhD from MIT specializing in virology and biogenetics . I was the youngest doctor hired by the CDC in over a decade , and Dr. Farragut put me in charge of isolation because I 'm qualified . Now , I will do my best to address your needs , but I want to make one thing perfectly clear : we will have order here . We 'll start with Dr. Tracey 's room . I 'll breach the door and enter first . Don 't follow until you hear the all-clear . What 's that ? Stun baton . Use ' em on polar bears . Non-lethal , but they pack a wallop . Ought to come in handy if we run into any bears . If we run into Peter Farragut , you 'll be glad we have these . He tore off a man 's head . You think a shock is gonna stop him ? - You got a better idea ? - Yeah , I do . No breaching , no batons . We knock on the door . If Dr. Tracey 's home , we have a conversation . And if she 's in no mood to converse ? I 've grown kind of fond of my hands . Dr. Tracey ? Dr. Tracey , it 's Alan Farragut with the CDC . These are from the sunroom . She was here . But she didn 't want to be . She was trying to get out . Then where the hell did she go ? Who are you ? D-Doreen Boyle . How do I know that 's your real name ? I-It 's on my driver 's license . I got my real weight on there too , but I 'm not telling you that . Who sent you here ? I work for the CDC . I study infectious diseases . Maybe you can help me ... - Don 't you come near us ! You hear me ? Us ? Who are you talking to ? You 're messing with my head . I 'm not gonna hurt you . to take you to isolation ... No , no , no ! Not there . They do terrible things to you . No , I can 't tell you . They 'll take me to the White Room like Dr. Hvit . I want off this base ! You get me on the helicopter . You promise me ? I 'll even get you to sit shotgun . - Come on , I 'll go with you ... - Why ... Why would you lie to us ? There is no helicopter here . No , not now , but I can make a call . You are a dirty , filthy liar . Now , what are we gonna do with you ? Are you all right ? Yeah . I thought I heard something . I keep thinking about Peter up there . It 's just the base settling . Have you slept since you arrived ? Uh , an hour or two . I 'm fine , really . Sleep in the Arctic is critical . The mind can play tricks . I 'll take that under advisement . Wait . What just happened ? - Did you see that ? - Yes . What was going on in that lab ? I told you . Peter was researching mutagens . I think we both know that was no mutagen . What was he really working on ? You 've got to let us out of here . This is kidnapping . I demand to talk to a lawyer ! - This is a public health crisis . The CDC has full jurisdiction . Oh ! A hell of a lot of good that 's done ! We could do a better job of finding a cure ourselves . - Give it a rest , Bryce . - You give it a rest ! You 're not the one who shared a bathroom with Typhoid Mary over there . I 'm sorry . Try to keep still . Or what ? I 'll get sick and die ? Must be bad you put the suit back on . We don 't know exactly what we 're dealing with . Everything could be fine . Not knowing is why things can 't be fine . Not knowing is why those two over there are gonna turn on me . It 's just - a matter of time . - I 'm not gonna let anything happen to you . I promise . That 's a promise you don 't want to make . Do you have morphine sulfate here ? He needs morphine now . Where do I get it ? Level G , drug stockroom . Get up ! Who is it ? One of the runners from the sunroom . He was hiding in the stairwell . That 's Dr. DeKlerk from the aerosol division . You didn 't have to be so rough with him . Maybe if you people followed directions . Maybe if you told us what the hell was going on . What 's wrong with him ? Is he infected ? Uh , we don 't know . What 's his name ? I told you . DeKlerk . His first name ! - Uh , Henrik , I think . - Henrik , we 're with you . We 're with you . We 'll take care of you . He 's still breathing . Get him to sickbay . Show 's over . Everyone go back to your rooms . Not until you tell us why we haven 't been evacuated . Keep him away from me . You didn 't answer my question . We 're doing the best we can . That 's bullshit . You 're from the CDC . You could get us out of here if you really wanted to . You know what ? You 're right . You 're right . We could evacuate you all , airlift you out to the nearest hospital , and you know what would happen then ? It would start with the doctors and the nurses . The ones caring for you . They 'd go home to their families , kiss their kids goodnight , and pass on the virus . And the next day at school , some of those kids would infect others , and in two weeks ' time , this virus ... is in the general population . In four weeks , every major city on this planet . So , no , we 're not evacuating you . But we 're not abandoning you . We will stay with you as long as it takes to figure this out . Now , please , just go back to your rooms . Nice speech . I haven 't heard that since ... Kikwit , ' 95 ? It was Joburg , ' 96 . What are you doing here ? There was something strange going on in Peter 's lab . I 've been combing surveillance tape ... I asked you to work on rate of infection . This seemed more important . - I thought I made this clear ... - What 's going on , Alan ? You were always stubborn , but at least you made sense . - We talked about this ... - Is this about Peter ? - That 's absurd . - Are you punishing me ? Because believe me , I 've punished myself enough for both of us . This is not the time , it 's not the place ... It was never the time or the place ! That was the problem to begin with . Jules . Ah ! You 're here for ... - What ? - You 're here for a reason ! Um ... yeah , I 'm , uh , I 'm with the CDC . - We 're here to help you . - No ! Not you . Walker . Got something here . Injection logs for the last three months . Here 's the date that matches the surveillance tape . February 19th . Lot 14 . He injected 0.2ccs of NARVIK-A . Lot 15 , 0.2ccs of NARVIK-B . What is that ? I encourage my staff to push the envelope , to try new and untested formulas . Was Peter experimenting with this ? Not that I was aware of . Who else worked in this lab with him ? You met both of them yesterday . In body bags . We need to replicate the test . Peter 's research . We can examine the results ourselves . Inject more rats ? And see what happens . I should 've known . They were never gonna use it for something good . Move a few genes here and there , activate the replication cycle . Bingo , you got yourself the perfect weapon . it wasn 't my fault , right ? How was I supposed to know it was gonna go sideways ? You can 't make a virus and expect it to follow instructions , right ? Don 't play dumb ! You 're not fooling anyone . You knew what you were doing this whole time . I am not taking the fall for this alone , you hear me ? ! Ah ! Oh , God ! I 'm sorry . What 's wrong with me ? Sarah ! Are you all right ? Not really . Did he ... touch you ? Make any kind of contact ? Did he get any secretions on you ? No , I 'm ... I 'm OK . He didn 't attack me . A lot of empty vials and syringes over here . Morphine sulfate . He 's in pain . This is good . - Excuse me ? If he has the presence of mind to self-medicate , then maybe we can talk him into coming back to isolation before he infects anyone else . I don 't know . He ... he had this look in his eyes . It wasn 't ... it wasn 't quite human . What else did he do ? You mean aside from climbing this cage like Spiderman ? He said something . He said , " You 're here for a reason . " Only not me , he said Walker . - Jules ? I think he left us a trail to follow . I 'll get a security team . I 'm going with you . Not this time , Doc . Things have been getting out of hand , and you know we can 't afford to lose you . But I 'll tell you what , though . How about you be my wingman ? Now I know what a TV dinner feels like . I didn 't think you were old enough to remember that one . Die Hard ? Sure , saw it in third grade . Tsk . Ouch . You see anything up there yet ? Nada . How do we even know he 's still up here ? If I know Peter , he 's still up there . What makes you so sure ? He used to hide in the attic when we were kids , when our dad was drinking or angry , which was a lot . Keep the chatter down . We don 't want to scare him away . No offence , but I don 't think he 's the one who 's scared . Will you look up ? I can 't see anything . - Join the club . - What was that ? What was what ? Tilt your head up about 20 degrees . Now look left . It 's dark up here . Get it ? Check your six . Make sure he 's not behind you . - Holy shit ! Ugh ! - Balleseros ! - Is he all right ? - I 'm not sure . Is he infected ? Well , he 's still breathing , none of that black shit on him . His pulse is steady . What happened up there ? Hell if I know . One minute I was alone . the next minute , I 'm getting a face full of your brother . I guess I must have nailed us both with that bug zapper . That stun baton packs 600kV . It should have knocked him out cold . Seems like a lot of things that should be happening with Peter aren 't . Base One . OK , we 're on our way . Elevator alarm just went off upstairs . Someone 's trying to leave the base . NARVIK-A subjects are decimated . Close to a 100 % mortality rate . - And NARVIK-B ? - Morbidity at 100 % , but mortality at zero . They 're infected but still alive . It 's been a long time since I did real lab work . Guess you forget how tedious it can be . No , I miss it . The precision , commitment , sacrifice , all leading to the joy of discovery . My mother used to say something just like that . She was also a scientist ? Cellular biologist , yeah . She died when I was very young . I am sorry . What about your father ? Oh , my god . Can 't you make him stop ? Morphine isn 't working . If I give him any more , - I might kill him . - Yeah , maybe that 's not such a bad idea . Nice . I suppose you 'd feel the same way if it was you lying there ? Look , I feel sorry for Haven , but those are the breaks . Everybody , please . We just need to be patient . That 's easy for you to say , you 're back inside that suit . This is just a precaution until we figure out a treatment . You 're not figuring out a treatment . In fact , I don 't think you know a damn thing about this virus at all . Stop it ! Stop . We 're all doctors here , right ? Instead of bickering , let 's put our heads together . Yeah , let 's get her to let us out of here . You know I can 't do that . There 's a chance that you could infect others or become violent ... And what if someone gets violent inside this box , huh ? What are we supposed to do then ? - Open the door . - At least let us go back to our labs . No . Do what you want , but I 'm not letting you out of here . Then you 're gonna call someone who will . Base One . - OK . We have to go back . - Why ? A couple of detainees are demanding to be let loose . They 're holding Dr. Jordan . Go . I 'll check outside , secure the perimeter . Security teams , confirm level lockdown . Release Dr. Jordan at once . - Then we can talk . - Let us out and she comes - with us . No harm done . - If you let us go back to our labs , we can help with the virus . Bryce is a hematologist . I 'm a biochemist . You are in isolation for your own safety . More like rats in a box . We 're not gonna die in here . We are working on an antiviral therapy . As soon as we run animal trials ... Animal trials could take weeks ! We 're not going to be around that long , and you know it . Dr. Farragut . I need you to let Dr. Jordan go . Uh-uh ! Don 't come any closer ! Look , we 're working as hard as we can to figure this thing out , and we won 't stop until we do . - We both know that 's a crock of shit . - Hear him out , Bryce . Listen , I 'm in here with you , not out there . We will work this out . All right ? Just give me the syringe - and let Dr. Jordan go . - Why should we trust you ? Dr. Farragut . Now we 're in this together . Alan , what you did back there ... Thank you . I was just doing my job . And so were you by not letting them leave . - I had a good teacher . - Yeah ? Do I know him ? There 's no risk anyway , what with the lack of airborne transmission . Jules , what is it ? I need to show you something . The NARVIK-A subjects died horribly ... lesions , hemorrhagic shock , liquification of internal organs . But the NARVIK-B subjects didn 't die . They became highly aggressive , agitated . Sounds like a lyssavirus . Maybe some form of rabies ? Rabies doesn 't include a compulsion to spread the contagion . I 've never seen a pathogen with such focused behavioral patterns . The B samples are acting just like vectors . Vectors on steroids . I think the B virus rewires the brain to create a perfect contagion machine . Like Peter . Dr. Farragut , Dr. Hatake would like a word with you . And I 'd like a word with him . Get down to isolation . Check on the infected patients . If what you 've discovered is true , we 're not just dealing with a single virus anymore . Going for a spin ? It 's a brisk night . I hope you brought your woolies . This doesn 't have anything to do with you . Still , I 'm gonna have to ask you to return back to the base . If you had any idea what they were doing here , you 'd be getting the hell out yourself . The transgenic experiments , the virus vaults ... Unregulated research sounds great until you 're actually doing it . What they did to those monkeys was ... was an abomination . Come back inside . I want to hear about this . I 'm not going back . Just come back inside . You 're gonna freeze out here . People have to know what 's going on up here . We have to tell the newspapers . Hell , we have to tell everyone . You okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . You don 't have to go back in there right now . I can handle it . I 'm good , thanks . A little help ? Meet Dr. Tracey . She 's in the advanced stages , but I got her tranqued up on monkey juice . Took me a long damn time to haul her ass up here . And there 's some other monkey business I think Dr. Farragut would like to hear about . You 're not bringing her in here , are you ? She 's going straight into the ICU chamber . You won 't have any contact . A little late for that , isn 't it ? He 's seizing ! I need a crash cart ! - Got it . - Do it now . Ah ! Come on , let 's get out of here ! This virus was less of a danger before the CDC arrived . My people were the ones attacked in there . Yours were doing the attacking . I thought you had that situation under control . I was mistaken . And I thought we had the full picture , not to mention complete access . Maybe you can tell me how it is that patients here just go missing , or how a member of my team is attacked by an infected monkey she was told didn 't exist in the first place . Or maybe you 'd like to tell me why my brother was tinkering with maybe the worst contagion this world has seen in his own damn lab ? You should ask your brother . I would never encourage something so reckless . First things first : how do we contain the infected patients ? We don 't , not without complete transparency . And if I refuse ? We came here to help . You no longer want that help ? That 's fine . But it seems to me we 're the last chance you have . So , maybe we give each other what we want , what we need ... and just maybe we all get out of here alive . - I 'm sorry . - For what ? It 's not your fault . I should 've been there . Ah , don 't beat yourself up . We 'll get them back . I didn 't keep you off the search because of Peter . I didn 't want to ... I lost you once . I appreciate that , I do . But I 'm not your responsibility anymore . You can 't keep trying to protect me . I don 't know that I can stop . Julia . Peter . Ah ! No . No ! No ! No ! Please ! Peter ! Please !

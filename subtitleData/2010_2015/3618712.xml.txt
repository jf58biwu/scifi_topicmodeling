 There are many ways to define our fragile existence . And many ways to give it meaning . I love you . I love you , Nathan . But it is our memories that shape its purpose and give it context . Hiro , you 're very sick . Brain tumor . I 'm dying . A private assortment of images , fears , loves , regrets . We alone choose the importance of each . How do you feel , Hiro ? Building our own unique histories one memory at a time . What have you done ? Did you send a cello to my apartment ? Cello , no . Hoping that ones we choose to remember don 't betray or trap us . They are no bad powers , Emma . You will learn to use your powers to do good things in the world . Where 'd you learn how to do that ? Medical school . I dropped out . Are you gonna go back to school ? Go be a doctor ? For it is the cruel irony of life that we are destined to hold the dark with the light . The good with the evil . You betrayed me . I 'm still your brother . I need you to start by retrieving some files from the apartment of a Mr. Noah Bennett . What do you want ? We don 't want anyone to get hurt . So we 'll just take what we came for , and we will be on our way . This is what separates us , makes us human . - Gone . - So are your files . And in the end , what we must fight to hold on to . Where 'd you get that ? I stole it from my dad . We came all this way to go to a carnival ? Claire . So glad you could make it . I think it 's time for some soul-searching . And you 're welcome to stay a few days and do just that . I 'm gonna stay . Just for a couple days . I 'm not sure she 's gonna serve a purpose for you . It 's not her I 'm after . Don 't worry about Eli , he 's harmless . Yeah ... I 've caught him staring at me , like , three times . It 's that you 're new . Everybody 's talking . Talking 's okay with me . Staring ? Not so much . You have breakfast yet ? Yes , I had the blueberry pancakes , and they were amazing . Mm . I 'm taking some to Samuel now . He is in his trailer . You know ... how about you take them to him ? Score some points . Not that you need to , but he does love mrs . Comey 's pancakes . Okay , sure . Thank you , Claire . No problem . Hope you brought extra syrup . How 'd you know I had pancakes ? I thought you were Lydia . That 's so very nice of you . That box in there looks a lot like the one from the paper company my dad used to work for . As you may have guessed ... Your father and I have shared more history than you know . Well , you can always fill me in . I 'm not interested in the past , Claire . Not when the future holds such infinite possibilities . The homeland you were talking about ? Yeah . And we 're almost there . And I 'd love nothing more than for you to stay and watch that come to fruition . Well , like I said , I do have to get back to class on Monday . Okay . Your loss . How do I look ? I 'm going to the city . Then you look very , uh ... - urban . - Good . 'Cause I need to make a positive impression . I 'm going to get someone ... someone essential for the plan coming together . Someone that can help us build a place where we can be free . Freedom is what you do with what 's been done to you . Sounds deep . Sartre . College . I always thought freedom was just another word for nothing left to lose . - That too . - You 'll see , Claire . We 'll stop running and find a permanent place to live , an ordinary place . Then ... you might even want to stay . Or go . It 's your choice . So she 's free to go ? Not in my lifetime . You make sure of that . ¶ to blow your head apart ¶ ¶ you got to see the show ¶ ¶ it 's a dynamo ¶ ¶ you got to see the show ¶ ¶ it 's rock and roll ¶ ¶ ohh ¶ Samuel . What the hell are you doing ? Give it up , little brother . It almost moved this time . Let 's see . Wow . Far out . Now come on . I 've got a show to do . Just you wait . I 'm gonna move bigger rocks than that . People are gonna come from all over the world to see me . You mean Vanessa 's gonna come see you . Huh ? Oh , Vanessa girl . Come and see my big dirt-moving show . Shut up . I can 't believe you 're still carrying a torch for that girl . Don 't you know we 're never going back there ? Tell you what ... If you can get people to buy a ticket to see a kid not move a rock , I 'll invite her myself . You 're a jerk . Just you wait . Just you wait , brother . Just you wait . Are you serious , mom ? Come on ! He 's nice . He just got here . I don 't even know him from Adam . I certainly don 't know his family . Since when do you care ? The answer is no . Something funny ? Sorry , no . No , no , no , I just ... I 've been looking for something normal in this place since this morning , and I finally found it when I was listening to you and your daughter argue . You sound like my mom and me . We had some serious knock-down , drag-outs , but ... I wonder if we had a place like this if things would 've been easier . How so ? Lose a finger , it grows back . Nobody looks twice . Oh , yeah , it 's paradise here . You don 't sound convinced . I didn 't mean anything by it . You know things , right ? I mean , you can see things . Your tattoos . Sometimes . Why ? I was just wondering if you ... Knew why Samuel wanted me here . Well , lately he 's wanted a lot of people here . Half of them want to date my daughter . Why 's he bringing so many people in ? It 's become an obsession of his . He spent all morning in his trailer . Yeah , with my dad 's files . Well , well . If it isn 't Nancy Drew . Is there something I can help you with , nance ? I was just looking for Samuel . He 's not around . Nice trick . I like to think so . Aren 't you on beautification duty ? Why don 't you run along and beautify ? Oh . Hiro ! Miss coolidge ? Yes ? My name is Samuel . I 've come a long way to see you . I 'm like you . No . But I have a gift like you . Emma , please let me explain . You can read lips ? No , Emma , wait , wait , wait . I 'm the one who sent you the cello . I 'm interested in people like us . I know that you can see things that other people hear . And that you feel them , oh , so much more . I know many people with gifts . And one of them can see from far away , and she helped me find you . We 're all connected , Emma . Thanks . I 'm sorry ... I 'm sorry I didn 't tell you that was from me . Giving it away was not that easy . Why ? It was meant for someone else . Someone special in my life . She and I ... were close . And then one day I lost her . May I ? It 's found its proper home . I can see that now . No , it didn 't do that . You did . It was your own fear . That 's why I 'm here . You have to let go of that fear and release your true ability . I need your help . I 've tried in my usual way to find this man . But I 've been unsuccessful . He 's ... he 's overwhelmed by his gift , like you 've been . But so much more lost . He thought he was losing his mind when the moss and the flowers started growing in his footsteps . He lost touch with this world and fell into the cracks . I 'm told he lives in central park . Cover the exits . Now you know what it feels like . Yeah . Nice trick . What do you think you 're doing , Barbie ? Let me go . Not until you tell me why you were in Samuel 's trailer . - Listen to me , okay ? - You 're a spy , aren 't you ? Hm , working for your father ? No . I came here on my own . I believed what Samuel was saying was real , but he 's collecting people with abilities . Yeah , why shouldn 't he ? We 're a family . You wouldn 't understand that , would you , Barbie ? Huh ? No . You only see the worst in people . Makes me want to pin you to that trailer so Samuel can find you when he gets back . Samuel is using my dad 's old files to track people down and bring them in . He 's got a map of that valley out there , and he is planning something . Yeah , and whatever it is ... You 're gonna ruin it for everyone . I 'm not gonna let you . I 'm not gonna let you ruin it for me . Your gift is more than seeing sound as color and putting cracks in the wall . My true ability , what is it ? Your emotions can become one with the music . You can bring people to you . Like a siren 's song . Siren ? Yeah , just play and you 'll see . Concentrate on him . Draw him to you . Now 's your chance . Make your prayers into song . It 's all right . Let the music fill you up . Is he all right ? Ah . I cannot thank you enough for getting him in . If you ever wanna help more of us , there 's a place I 'd like you to visit . We could use a doctor ... And a siren . This 'll help get you there . I will . Thank you . Thank you . She 's different , like me . Not different . Special . I always thought I was alone in the world . I guess I 'm ... just a little scared . So many of us are , friend . So many . But not for long . Let 's go home . Sources confirm the remains found in the the small plane crash are that of New York senator Nathan Petrelli . The ntsb is promising a complete and thorough investigation into the crash . At this time , investigators are reporting that the senator was the pilot and sole passenger of the plane . You 're getting weak . Otherwise you would 've forced my mouth shut . Don 't tempt me , Barbie . I 'm telling you . Samuel 's up to something . And he 's lying to all of you . No . He 's a good man . Why are you so sure ? Because I 'm good now . This place is good for me . I haven 't done anything wrong since I got here . Joseph set me straight . He showed me what was good and true about my ability . Joseph . Is that who 's in that picture there next to Samuel ? - Yeah . - Samuel 's brother . He didn 't want to let me in at first . Samuel convinced him . Lydia said that Samuel was obsessed with making the family bigger . Why do you think that Samuel 's bringing in all these people ? Huh ? Shut up ! - This is my home now , Barbie . - Listen to me . I don 't want to destroy this place . But if Samuel 's bringi people in for a reason , don 't you think that 's gonna put everyone in danger ? You know me . Do you seriously think I want to destroy your home ? Talk to Lydia . She knows . Thank you . Lydia ? Claire ? What are you doing here ? I just went into Samuel 's trailer . He has a map of the valley . What is he planning ? Lydia . You wanted me to go in there for a reason , why ? You know something and you 're not telling me what it is . Samuel wasn 't ... he wasn 't always in charge . Joseph ... he was our real father . He made this place a home . I miss him . We all miss him . What happened to him ? He killed him , didn 't he ? He 's lost his way , Claire . I am scared for all of us . Yeah , I woke up this morning and I wasn 't sure about this place . But this place is special . For you , and for your daughter . Even Doyle . The only thing wrong with it is Samuel . You have to help us . Please . You have to find someone that can stop him . I will . No buried treasure for you , Nancy Drew . What were you thinking ? You told me to watch her . She 's not a prisoner . If she wants to go , she can go . Not a prisoner ? Sure feels that way with copy boy over here . Don 't you ever get sick of him ? Stay or go , Claire . It 's still your choice . I 'll go . After you tell me what happened to Joseph . Eli , give us a minute . Did Lydia tell you ? No , I asked her , she wouldn 't . It 's true , isn 't it ? You killed him . I lost control . Like that is an excuse ? He told the government about us . You remember them , don 't you ? They lured him in . Very same people that have been chasing us for years . Emile Danko . Same one who worked alongside your father . The man who imprisoned you , Claire . How do you think your father got the compass ? This is not about my father , okay ? This is about what you did . What I did was awful . Joseph put us all in danger . After years of running free . I wasn 't about to let him get away with that . I wasn 't about to let him take that away from us . So murder was the answer ? You , of all people , should understand how far a father will go to protect his family . Hasn 't your father lied , cheated , even killed ... To protect you ? What 's going on out in that valley ? Every artist needs his canvas , Claire . And Ian ... Well , Ian is Picasso . I need water . That can be arranged . It 's beautiful . It 's you . It 's who you are . It is beautiful . What is this place ? Our new home . My brother would 've loved it . He never believed it was possible . He certainly never believed I could make it real . This is why I need a bigger family , to build the future . This could be your home too , Claire . I have a home . And I 'd like to go back to it . Of course . But just remember ... you 're free , Claire . Whatever happens in your world back home , you can always come back to this one . Whenever you want . I know . Claire , we need to talk . Claire bear , call me . Claire , hey , it 's Peter . Um ... you need to call me . Something happened . We have a lot to talk about . I 'm glad you 're safe . From what ? Where I came from or this lie ? I know you took the compass . And I 'm not giving it back . My brother Nathan taught me a lot . He taught me ... How to ride a skateboard when I was a kid , how to hook a marlin , he taught me how to catch a baseball . Those are all things usually a father 'll teach his son . But dad wasn 't around . So it was Nathan . And I wish to hell it would 've been my father , because Nathan didn 't make it easy . He would throw it high , or he 'd throw it wide . And I would yell at him . I would tell him to throw it right at me . But he 'd say to me , " that 's not how it 's gonna come at you in a game , Pete . " I used to think he was just being a big brother and he was picking on me . But now I understand . He just wanted me to be ready ... For anything . I 'm ready , brother . For whatever comes . Detail , atten-hut ! Detail , halt ! Flag . Ma 'am , this flag is presented on behalf of a grateful nation for the honorable and faithful service rendered by your loved one . Thank you . Ready . Aim . Fire ! Aim . Fire ! Aim . Fire ! Honor , hut !

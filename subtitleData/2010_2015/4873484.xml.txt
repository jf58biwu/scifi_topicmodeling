 Twenty years ago when the corporations bailed out our failed governments , they sold it to us as salvation ... Now we see that we paid for that rescue with our freedoms . We have awaken to the truth that we have become slaves to the Corporate Congress ... Today that all changes . Let the word go forth from this time and place , to friend and foe alike , that we have passed the torch to a new generation unwilling to permit the undoing of human rights and dignities . And let every corporation know , whether it wishes us well or ill , that we shall pay any price in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty . Don 't move ! Hands where we can see them ! Stay where you are ! I got this , Kiera . You 're under arrest . Under section 76 of the Union Code , you are charged with being the leader of the terrorist group Liberate . And conspire to plot against the Corporate Congress . You 're too late . My God ! Liberate murdered 30,000 people to kill 20 . Of course they deserve to be executed . Separate their methods from their message . For just a second . Forget it . Never happen . Because they went too far . So you do agree with them ? No , I understand them . You understand bombing the Corporate Congress and killing people ? No , I understand wanting to return to democracy again versus a corporate dictatorship . Come on , governments lost their relevance after they went belly up . So what , So we 'd be dead , or in the street , if it wasn 't for the corporate bailout ? And you wouldn 't have that ivory tower to teach out of . We 've given up representation , free speech , assembly . Seems like you 're still free to speak your mind . Alerts on corporate .. ... and CPS webs as well . Something 's up . A call to arms on the eve of the executions . They 're just trying to intimidate us . Won 't work . After tomorrow tonight , they 'll just be dead . And we 'll move on with our lives . Mom ? Are the bad guys attacking us again ? No . The bad guys are in prison . And pretty soon they will never be able to hurt anyone again . Do you have to go ? Yeah , it 's my job . For me ? For tomorrow , in case you need back up . Thank you . First execution in 40 years . You should be proud you got the assignment . Thanks . ... check in your sector . Please confirm I.D. Hang on . Looks like you 're up . Won 't take long . You 're a suspect in a crime . Maintain your position . CPS Eight Eleven . Suspect recog . Uploading . That 's a match . Tyler Killen . Property damage . Book and process . You 're tagged , Mr. Killen . Report to a CPS station for booking , or face the pain . And bring your little friend here with you . You too . You better clean up your acts , or you 'll be permanent visitors at this place . Take my advice ... You want to leave this world with your dignity and your emotions intact . That 's what your followers would want , and more importantly that 's what I want . Do we understand each other ? We just received credible information that Liberate 's plan is to attack the execution chamber itself . Back up Prison Security . Stay alert . Change of plan Kiera , you 're with Elena and the Chamber . Rest of you with me . What do you think Greg ? Circus or justice ? You don 't believe every one in the world needs to see this . I would have preferred something a little less public . But the surviving members of the board insisted . The board is right . We need to take an eye for an eye . Execute them as a deterrent . Curtis Chen . Jasmine Garza . Lucas Ingram . Stephan Jawarski . Edward Tagami . Matthew Kellogg . Travis Burka . Sonia Ballentine . Kiera ... You have been convicted of crimes against the Union and sentenced to death . All appeals have been exhausted . There will be no cogitation . Prisoners , take your positions on the table . What the hell ? He 's got something ! Kiera ! CONTINUUM S01 Ep01 - A Stitch in Time CPS , this is Cameron . CPS ? Anyone ? What the hell ... Where am I ? Come on , man , let 's go ! CPS ! Maintain your position ! Ingram ! Central . This is Cameron . I need back up ! Who is this ? CPS Officer Cameron . Respond one . I 'm separated from my team . I need back up . Some weird shit is going down . CP ... ? Look . This is an experimental , encrypted frequency . How did you find this channel ? What ? Is this the same MIT hacker who is creeping my fire-wall ? If it is , I am so going to bust you ! This is a security net you idiot . You 're in violation . Nice try . I don 't care who you are or what you think , but I need back-up at this location . Now ! Location ? Holy shit , it works . But it shouldn 't ... This is impossible . UGH ! Start talking . Not to you . You shot me up with Torox ? Bitch . What happened back there , Lucas ? Where are we ? What did you guys do ? Time jump . The vortex . You were there ... Now you 're here . Where ? Where is here ? Same place we started . Place , not time . Space , not time . Get it ? Where is the prison ? Not where is the prison . Where the prison will be . Should have been six years looks like 60 . Would have been a sweet escape . How do we get back ? How do I get home ? You are home . What happens now ? We become ghosts . We blend in and you 're no one is going to find us . Watch me . Here ya go ! RISE UP BROTHERS ! JOIN THE FIGHT ! Drop the weapon ! Drop it ! Hands on your head ! You alone ? Nope . I 'm with her . Nice try . I can 't lie ... I 'm on a drug . You don 't say ? A truth serum . I 've never been in an automobile . Then this is your lucky day . One down , seven to go . Hello ? I heard that . I know you 're still there . I was listening ... One down , seven to go ... I heard everything ... My question is , how ? I haven 't put the tech your talking on into circulation yet , so how the hell do you have it ? Isn 't somebody going to explain to me what just happened ? Well , Lucas is the only one who can tell us but he 's not here . What about Kagami ? He didn 't make it through . We 'll be okay without him . Knock yourselves out ! How can this be happening ? Mister Buddy back there was talking about time jumping . Time traveler ... Hello ? If I 'm in the past , how are you in my head ? How are you on my computer ? Who is this ? My name 's Alec . Alec . What year is this ? 2012 . NO ! I have a son . He has to see his dentist tomorrow . We were going to go to Lemurs' concert this weekend . It 's my anniversary next month . It is not 2012 . What year are you from ? 2077 . You are not from 2077 ! Why would I lie about it ? If that 's true , then you are screwed . A bone handle ! Our division commander had one of these . Never liked that guy . Nice shot . I missed . Where the hell am I ? You 're at the corner of Pender and Beatty . How do you know that ? Look , I don 't know what 's going on either , but there 's no way you and I should even be talking to each other . We 're communicating on a next-gen , Liquid Chip , experimental frequency that is encrypted from my end ... Liquid Chip ? That 's proprietary . You created this technology ? Yes . You 're Alec Sadler . You know me ? None of this makes any sense . Let 's figure this out . Meet me . No . You are going to need money . You are going to need a place to stay , right ? That 's first thing you 've said that does make sense . Good then what I want you to ... Hello ? Am I the only one who 's going to point out the obvious here ? Travis . Even if we manage to make an impact in this time , there will be enough years between now and the revolution to turn it around . The revolution is on our schedule now , Kellogg . The war begins now . Now ... About me . Hello ? Get out of my head , Alec . You can 't shut me out . I built the system we 're talking on , remember ? But I understand ... You think by telling me about myself , you might create a paradox whereby because of my knowing , it doesn 't happen ? What you may not know is that there are two schools of quantum time travel theory . On the one hand , you have already changed the future by going back in time . The damage is done and you can 't stop what has already started . What 's the other ? That this journey is part of your own time-line from the future . That is to say , all of these events actually happened before , and you 're simply going through the motions , again . Does that mean I 'm going to get back to my time ? If that 's what happens ... or happened . It 's a little confusing , even for me . Or maybe you 're just some hacker thief who stole my research , and this is some elaborate ruse . You 're so pretty . Not cool . Turn it off , Alec . Is it off ? Yeah , it 's off . Whoa , whoa ... Something just happened . I 'm getting a lot of interference . Relax . It 's probably my CMR . CMR ? Cellular Memory Review . I am outfitted with a CMR bio-upgrade . A memory pack is implanted in my skull and records telemetry , video and audio from my cortex for use in chain of evidence and trials . No one needs to testify . All is recorded . Everything is all on playback ? Normally , I download at the end of the day into a CPS server at the end of the day . Very funny mister ! You can have him back when you 're done . Soy-moo , again ? Kiera ... See you after work , sweetheart . I 'll meet you on the train . Kiera . Bye dad . How old is your son , Kiera ? That 's enough for tonight . Shit . Back up . God damn . ... they catch an employee and they call him a ' rogue trader ' and throw him in jail . My son is right , but when the bank CEO does it , they bail him out with our money . How is that justice ? Sorry . Alec , did you sleep in the barn again last night ? Yeah , sorry . Big project . No need to be sorry . This is my stepson , Alec . Why don 't you join us ? Maybe some other time . Nice to meet you ... all of you . Okay . Long night . Going to grab a shower . All right . He 's not ready ... Not yet . Good evening , Police in Portland are trying to locate the shooter in a gang slaying that took the lives of three men in a brazen evening attack last night . I have to say we 're absolutely not surprised to find him here ... Described automatic gun fire from a block FTB ... Police have not released the IDs of the victims ... You believe this ? What have you got ? All signs point to an explosion . But there are no bomb fragments , no evidence of combustible material , no residue at all . How is that even possible ? Good question . Do you recognize her ? Not one of mine . Just give me a sec , Excuse me . Can I help you ? No thank you . I don 't think you understand . This is a crime scene . I 'm going to have to ask you to leave . You 're law enforcement ? Detective Carlos Fonnegra . Special Investigations Unit . You picked up a suspect last night ? Male . 30 's . Red jumpsuit . Probably intoxicated . We did . Are you suggesting he had something to do with this explosion ? Yes . Did you pick up any other suspects last night ? Just the one you described . You saying he 's part of a gang ? A very dangerous one . There are six others that are headed somewhere this way . I 'm assuming at least one of them is injured . You seem to know quite a bit about this incident . Which agency are you with ? I 'm ... I should get going . Anything you can add to help lighten my workload would be greatly appreciated , trust me . I 'm sorry , I don 't want to get in trouble ... This isn 't exactly my jurisdiction . Look , this character we brought in last night , he 's got no ID , he 's not telling us his name . Doesn 't show up in any print or DNA databases . A little help would be nice . His name is Lucas Ingram and you won 't find him in any database . What else you got ? I 've said too much already . I think both of us know you 're a cop . Why are you pretending not to be ? Aren 't we supposed to be on the same side ! Helping each other out . Linda Williams , Detective Portland PD , Number 1272 . Portland ? You showing up without approval could be quite the political hot potato . Don 't sweat it . Nice to meet you Detective Williams . How about I get you in a room with Lucas Ingram ? After that you can decide whether or not you want to help me . Thanks . Carlos . Well you seem to have adjusted quickly . Where are the others ? Probably doing things they shouldn 't be . Answer the question , Ingram . Please , the adults are talking right now . Detective , could you give us a minute ? I think it might help . Who fixed you up in the prison ? What are you talking about ? The device was smuggled in . You had someone on the inside . What difference does it make ? You can 't go back and file a report . How do you get back to 2077 ? You can 't undo what 's been done . We 're here . We can 't get back . You don 't know that . Actually , before I joined the movement I was a SadTech engineer , so yes , I do know . And let me be clear . This has always been a one-way ticket , Look , with the knowledge you have , why not just make some quick money on the stock market or sports , buy an island and hide out when the shit hits the fan ? Stay out of our way and we 'll leave you alone . Do you know who I am ? You 're a Protector . Yeah , a Protector . A nobody cop . You , you 're somebody . I bet if I had the right person and proper means to look , I could find out quite a bit about you Is the right person me ? I 'm talking to you ! What ? ! It is me ! Okay , sweet , what are we looking for ? You were born Lucas Talbert . Talbert , got it ! You took your mother 's name , Ingram , after your father went to prison . She was , correction , she will be born in Victoria a few years from now , to Kent and Mary-Lee Ingram . Mary-Lee Ingram , found her ! 66 Beaconsfield Road . 66 Beaconsfield Road . It 's on a cul-de-sac . Last house on the right . The price of being a famous terrorist . You wouldn 't . Right before I buy that island . Wait ! I 'll tell you what I know ! What did you say to him ? We talked about his future . My boss wants a word . This Ingram character is linked to gang activity in Portland ? I just spent the better part of a decade crushing the local gangs , and I 'll be damned if some Oregon startups are going to make camp in my backyard , you understand me , Detective ? Yes , sir . Then enlighten me . My hunch is they are moving their territory North . They 're part of a larger gang . West Coast based . Started in Portland . They will expand rapidly by taking over other gang chapters and affiliates . You guys call in the Marines ? Stay back , folks . You can expect well-coordinated and violent criminal activity . A ruthless disregard for the law and some unorthodox tactics . So you 're an expert ? Gang task force or something like that ? Something like that . Who 's your direct supervisor ? Your Lieutenant ? My direct supervisor ? Who do you report to ? I want to know who to thank for setting up a Portland based operation in my precinct without my authorization . Still waiting , Detective . Yeah ... Put him through ... Walt .. Woah , woah , woah , slow down .. ... Son of a bitch ... I have two officers down . Their cruiser was stripped of weapons and ammunition . Whatever you 're talking about ... It already started . They 're following a tactical protocol . Shelter , weapons , credits . Currency . Money . That 's their plan ? We 've got a half a dozen bank alarms triggered all over the city . Is this in their play-book ? It 's a diversion . What ? There 's only one bank being robbed . How do you know ? Focus on the last alarm tripped . Why that one ? Because they wouldn 't move until they had cover . Go . Cavalry 's on the way . Stay back . Carlos , I need a weapon ! No , what I need you to do , is to stay back and keep out of my way . Listen to me , with guys like these I need a weapon ! Not a chance ! So I guess a gun is still out of the question ? ! You gotta be kidding me ! Go for the head ! Fry , bitch . Jawarski 's down ! Jawarski ! She 's running ! I got her , I got her ! Kiera , are you okay ? Alec , listen , no matter what happens to me , you have to tell people these guys are going to start a war ! No one is going to believe me . There are things behind the vent cover in my hotel room . Things that should convince anyone you 're telling the truth . Promise me , Alec . I will . I promise . Okay , here we go . You ain 't going anywhere . - Are you hit ? - Let me go . Not a chance . We have you cornered ! Friendly 's ! Are there any more of these guys outside ? Just these three . We have to get back to the station . Jesus Christ . I need a medic . Inspector ! I have six dead here , two in the alley . Lucas Ingram ? They shot their way in here and broke him out of holding . He 's gone . Look , I need every cop I can get my hands on right now . You talk to your command . Given your expertise when it comes to this gang , I 'm not letting you go . - I 'll handle it . - Then handle it ! This means war . You pulled some pretty crazy shit back there . I should thank you for saving my ass . Yes , you should ... What I can 't figure is whether you just like playing hero , or if you 're actually a little bit crazy . I know what this group is capable of . I lost friends too . Thanks for everything today . They didn 't have to murder those officers like that . They 're soldiers , starting a war that they already lost once . That 's why they were in prison , 'cause they lost a war ? They tried to assassinate the heads of the world 's largest corporations . Killed tens of thousands of innocents as collateral damage . That 's what they 'll do now . Pick up where they left off ? Not if I can help it . You never told me what happens . To me . No , I didn 't . I 'm not sure I should . I knew it . It 's something bad , isn 't it ? Alec , I ... Forget it . You 're right . People shouldn 't know too much about where they 're headed . Dad ! There 's my boy ! Come here . You 're probably very busy , we should go . Nonsense . Introduce me ? Sam , this is my boss . That 's your building . Yes , and it 's a pleasure to meet you young man . Finally . And this is my wife , Kiera . Kiera . It 's long overdue ... I 'm Alec Sadler .

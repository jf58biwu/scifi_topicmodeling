 Previously on Fringe : When objects from the other universe cross to our side they have an energy . - Someone described it as a glimmer . - How can I see it ? The Coretexiphan trials . I was part of the trials when I was a kid . It was a highly experimental drug . It might enhance certain abilities in predisposed children . I 've never met anyone who can do the things that you do . I 'll go get my coat . Please don 't tell him . Sure you don 't want some soup ? - Tea or coffee , to warm you up ? NEIL : No , thank you . I have trouble keeping anything down . Your office told me how busy you are . I really appreciate you coming . I 'm sorry , I keep trying to remember you . I understand . It was a long time ago . We were just kids . So is that when you think you were exposed to something ? I 've seen about a half-dozen doctors . Specialists . They think it 's the only explanation that makes sense . Well , maybe I can help you . Look , I 'm grateful you 're doing this , but that 's not why I asked to see you . - I wasn 't looking to make money . - Of course . I understand . But if someone 's responsible for your illness , my firm can absolutely ... The last doctor I saw , he suggested that if I could find some of the other kids we went to school with if some of them have the same symptoms it might help him identify what it is that 's making me sick . I 'm sorry , I ... I really don 't remember names . It 's so long ago . You know what ? I do remember one boy . Lloyd ... Lloyd Becker . He made me eat a bug on the playground . - I remember him . - Lloyd Becker ? Sounds like a budding sociopath . Yeah , right . I really appreciate you helping me out . MIRANDA : Neil Wilson . N-E-l-L . Could you make an appointment with that oncologist at Rhode Island General ? - The one that always calls me " honey . " Was it Gorsky ? - Gorlami ... - Dr. Gorlitsky ? - Gorlitsky . That 's right . - Gorlitsky . I 'll call him now . All right , thanks . I should be back in 20 minutes . Bye . Come on . Hey . What 's going on in there ? Miss . You okay ? Help . Help . Help me . Hello . SAM : Is that you , Dunham ? I thought you 'd quit bowling , took up another sport . It 's been a while . I see you 're still not sleeping . Not so much . No . Can you pass me a nut ? Yeah , sure . Which one ? Dealer 's choice . Perfect . What 's on your mind ? Well ... After my car accident , you said that I would experience things . I have . SAM : Want a beer ? - It 's 6 : 30 in the morning . Well , when you 've been up all night , time is just a matter of semantics . No . Thanks . So I suppose you 're here to find out what happens next . Suppose I am . I can 't tell you . You 've officially gone beyond my field of expertise . But I believe I can tell you why you 're not sleeping . And it has nothing to do with your accident . You 're a cop . And you must make a dozen decisions a day . Many of them life and death . One of them you 're not happy about . You think you did the wrong thing . I 'm right , aren 't I ? Yeah . But it wasn 't the job . Not exactly . I ... I agreed to keep a secret . A secret ? Dunham . Okay , I 'm on my way . - Good thing you didn 't take the beer . - Yeah . I 'll see you later . Hey , Dunham . You 're a good person . You know , one of the few I know . If you agreed to keep this secret , I 'm sure you had a good reason . Yeah . Killington . As in skiing ? They just had a fresh snowfall . I had no idea you were a skier . Oh , yes . I was quite a hot-dogger . I remember there was this secret trail . They called it " the backside . " For the Beast , do you think ? It 's a nude ski run . By the time you got down to the bottom , your testicles would be in your mouth . I 'm sure Agent Dunham is very thankful for that image . Walter 's advocating a father-son trip . I 'm sure Agent Dunham is not interested in that . I understand that Agent Broyles has a body for us to look at . Her name is Miranda Greene . Thirty years old , unmarried , she was an attorney , lived in Providence . EMTs responded to a 911 call phoned in by a Good Samaritan . She was dead by the time they arrived . Doctor . This is Agent Olivia Dunham . This is Peter Bishop . - And Dr ... - Walter Bishop . I ... John Potash . I took your Advanced Biochem seminar , Dr. Bishop . I apologize . - I remember I was a bit of a slave driver . POTASH : You were . But also inspiring . The truth is , I was considering changing majors . But you encouraged me to stick with it , become a doctor . I never thought I 'd get a chance to thank you . Your father is a great man . - Doctor , which one is Miranda Greene ? - Ah . Right this way . Sorry , this might be a bit unpleasant . Epidural blistering . Tissue necrosis . Symptomatic of cytotoxins . Could you get a sample of this pus please , Peter ? I get the good jobs . According to her coworkers , when she left for lunch she was fine . Hadn 't mentioned any illness . That was about two hours before the 911 call . I was considering that these are contact burns from some synthetic chemical . Well , these are not chemical burns . They look more like malignant tumors . - Cancer ? Sarcomas , to be exact . But that kind of cancer presents beneath the skin , not on the surface . Normally , yes . - Do you have a black light ? - Yeah , somewhere . - What is it , Walter ? I 'm not sure . But cancers always start with a specific point of origin and they spread from there , so ... Hm . Ah . POTASH : Here you go . Agent Broyles , lights please . The cells near the point of origin of the cancer should show more progression . Hence , refract a different color . Ooh . Like that . It looks like ... Fingers . Hm . Indeed . A right hand , I 'd say . Which indicates not only what killed this woman but also who . Of course , somehow we 'll need to retrieve a print . Dr. Bishop , what you 're suggesting is impossible . That someone touched this woman and gave her cancer ? It seems you have forgotten my very first lesson , doctor . When you open your mind to the impossible sometimes you find the truth . Twenty-eight degrees Fahrenheit , and they 're predicting snow next week . - Hardly ideal beach weather . - Why are you going to Atlantic City ? I was thinking of taking Peter there . He used to love saltwater taffy as a child . So , what are we looking for ? Why are we cutting off this poor woman 's arm ? The handprint shows an extraordinary level of cellular detail . I 'm hoping ... Hoping to be able to remove the tumor and bake the skin . Hopefully identify who the print ... Oh ! And I 'll need two hot baths and an oven . You really think someone touched her and gave her cancer ? Terrifying possibility , but a possibility nonetheless . We need glycerin , corn starch , and food coloring . - Food coloring ? - Not for her but since we 're baking , we may as well make some taffy . MESSING : I 've worked with Miranda for seven years . She 's fairly private , but if she was sick , someone would have known . So , what sort of cases did Miranda usually work on , Mr. Messing ? Mostly toxic tort litigation . Class-action stuff , asbestos , lead poisoning . She had a real thing about protecting those who couldn 't protect themselves . And is this what she was working on ? Yeah . She was prepping a case against Intrepus Pharmaceuticals . - Trial was supposed to start next week . Hm . How much money was at stake in the trial ? North of eight figures . Wait , are you suggesting that someone did this to her ? I thought she contracted some kind of crazy disease . We 're not sure , but we like to be thorough . Can we take her files on the Intrepus case ? God , of course , yeah . Miss Greene had meetings scheduled yesterday . Do you recognize any of those names ? MESSING : First two are deposition prep . I don 't recognize the third one . Neil Wilson . She was supposed to meet him about an hour before she died . Do you really think Intrepus Pharmaceutical killed this woman ? Maybe . You don 't . Never heard of a drug that can cause what happened to Miranda . Just seems like a lot of trouble to kill somebody . Why not just hire a hit man ? A hit man could draw too much attention . Really ? And spontaneous fatal tumor growth wouldn 't ? I suppose you have a point . Wanna come on inside ? We could noodle on it , maybe order a pizza . Thanks , but no . I didn 't get much sleep last night so I should probably head home . Anyway , I 'm not really hungry . - All right . - Thank you . Agent Dunham . You 're up early . Yeah . I ran Neil Wilson 's number . A disposable cell phone and it was deactivated yesterday . It 's a common name . There 's more than 50 Neil Wilsons in the tri-state area . Do you want me to start running them down ? No . I 'm pretty sure he gave her a fake name anyway , so ... Astrid , could you give Walter and I a minute ? Sure . Walter ? Don 't mix up the spoons . Agent Dunham , help me stir . Walter , I have to tell him . I gotta tell Peter the truth . - That 's not what we discussed . - I know . And I 'm sorry . But he deserves to know the truth about who he is . No . No , you don 't understand . Things have never been better between us . I can 't lose him again . - I can 't . - You won 't . Once he knows the whole story . Walter . You saved his life . I am sure that he will understand . No , he won 't . He will never forgive me . I have to tell him . If it was the other way around , I 'd want him to tell me . I 'm begging you , not yet , please . Give me time to prepare . Please . Hey . I didn 't realize you were coming . I 'd have got you one too . Cappuccino , two squirts of peppermint . - And Astrid ... - Dunham . ... tall nonfat double capp , just the way you like it . Miranda used her credit card at a downtown Providence caf ? .. ... about a half-hour before she died . Sounds like her meeting with Neil Wilson . Excellent . Well , I 'm up for a road trip , how about you ? I remember her . Pretty lady . Comes in here all the time . - She 's a lawyer , right ? Yeah . You remember if she was with anyone last time she was here ? Some guy . She was taking all sorts of notes . - What , she sue doctors or something ? - Excuse me ? Well , the guy she was with , he looked real pale and skinny . - Dark circles under his eyes . - You think he was sick ? I 'd say pretty bad . Looked like my uncle did when he was fighting cancer . Are you thinking what I 'm thinking ? Well , I 'm thinking that cancer isn 't contagious . It wouldn 't be the strangest thing we 've seen . But it would be close . - Getting ready for a triathlon ? - Just trying to stay healthy . - You okay , sir ? - Yeah , I just , uh ... - You need me to call for some help ? - No . No , I 'm fine . Yes . I 'm an old friend of Mr. Becker 's . We went to school together . I must have the wrong Lloyd Becker . Sorry to bother you . Walter . Miranda Greene had lunch with someone just before she died . With a man that may have had cancer . - Does that suggest anything to you ? - Cancer isn 't contagious , of course . - That 's what I said . - Although ... Are you familiar with the Chinese notion of chi , Agent Dunham ? No . - The touch of death . Exactly . The Chinese believe that all living creatures contain an energy , our chi and that with proper training , a simple touch can affect their chi reverse it and cause sickness , even death . - Except , of course , they can 't . Because the touch of death is just a legend . Of course , what would be more interesting wouldn 't be a transfer of energy , but an exchange . - Meaning what ? - This other man you say that he was sick too , that he had cancer as well ? - Possibly . - And at the time she met him Miss Greene was perfectly healthy . - Yes . Then I suggest what we 're looking at here adheres more closely to Tantric sex . - Sex . Yes . Insofar as the goal of Tantric sex is a heightened state of perception . Of awareness . The partners are not interested merely in the sexual experience they are seeking an exchange of energy . Okay , so what does this have to do with Miranda Greene ? His cancer for her health . It 's possible that the man that Miss Greene met did this to her as a way to delay the progression of his own disease . Hi . - Lloyd Becker . - Oh , yeah , right , you 're Alex . Alex Taylor . Thanks for seeing me . Of course , yeah . How you doing ? - Come on in . - Thanks . Victim 's name is Lloyd Becker . Thirty . A neighbor saw his door open , she came in and discovered his body . There 's no sign of forced entry , no sign of a struggle . Clusters of malignant sarcomas . Just like Miss Greene . Did anyone see the suspect ? Police canvassed the building and the neighborhood . No luck . Hm . Malignancies appear to originate in this hand and then to spread out . - Maybe from a handshake . That 's a fine deduction , Peter . What do you see ? Nothing . I mean , nothing that tells me why Lloyd Becker was chosen as a victim . There must be a connection . - Where 's Walter ? - The ME 's gonna transport the body back to the lab . They told Walter he could ride along . - What ? - It 's nothing . Look , I think I know what it is that 's bothering you . Why it is you 've been so awkward around me for the last couple weeks . - Okay . - That trip to Jacksonville was crazy . We were both exhausted , we were both emotional , and ... If something had happened between us , if we had actually kissed we 'd have to deal with that . But we didn 't . No . No , we didn 't . Right . This past year , this is the longest I 've ever stayed in one place . So this thing that we have , you , me , Walter this little family unit that we 've got going I don 't wanna do anything to jeopardize that . I don 't either . Okay . So we 're good then , right ? Yeah . Good . I found more victims . Five deaths over the past 20 months from Chicago to Hartford . Each person died from the same kind of rapid-onset cancer . Healthy people keeling over like this didn 't set off any alarm bells ? A couple were considered medical anomalies and police looked into another , but nothing suggested murder . So , what is it about these people that 's making them targets ? We need to cross-reference their files . See if we can find what they may have in common . All right , I 'm on it . Timothy Ober . Is his middle name Michael ? Um ... Yeah . Timothy Michael Ober . Why ? You know him ? How ? I don 't know . What 's up , buttercup ? - It 's past midnight . - Do you feel like playing a game ? - Clue ? - Yeah . I thought it might be up your alley . Colonel Mustard with the revolver in the billiard room . See , that 's the third time that you guessed the billiard room . Always wanted a billiard room . I thought you would make a better detective . I detected that you needed company . You 've lived here a while , but you 're still living out of boxes . Maybe you moved around a lot as a kid . A tumultuous childhood . And a hard time forming relationships . I may not be the gumshoe you are , but I 've got some skills . Well , you 're right about moving around a lot . - I was a military brat . - That would explain the uniform . - The uniform ? - Yeah . Bland clothes . I don 't think I 've ever seen you in a primary color . It 's because it 's more than a job to you . You 're a soldier , protector . God , you 'd be a blast at dinner parties . - I don 't get invited to many . - No . Heh . So , what about you ? What made you the way you are ? Oh , I don 't know . I 'm older than I look . I barely remember my childhood . I 'm also taller than I appear . That 's it . What ? What did I say ? Hey . - Hey . When we were in Jacksonville there was a height chart on the wall with names . First name and last initial . All the kids I was in daycare with . Yeah , all the kids from Walter and Bell 's Coretexiphan trials . So while I was there , I wrote down all their names and I made a list . Timothy O. , Timothy Ober . He was there . We were both part of Walter 's tests . So that 's where you remembered him from . Keep looking . Miranda G. And Lloyd B. - Julie H. Alan D. They 're all there . All five of his victims . - What does that mean ? Why is this guy ... ? - Killing Coretexiphan kids ? I don 't know . I think we should wake up Walter . That won 't be necessary . Agent Dunham . Peter . - Is it morning already ? Oh , no . No , no . It 's still the middle of the night . Walter , what is that smell ? It 's taffy . I 'm making it for Peter . I think she was probably referring to your other project . Is that the killer 's handprint ? I think we 're close to getting a fingerprint . The ridges on the forefingers are quite clear now . Once it 's cooled a little , I should be able to run it through the scanner . Whoever the killer is , he 's started to target Coretexiphan subjects . - Are you sure ? Yeah . Why ? Why would he do that ? Well , we were hoping you may have some idea . I don 't know . But I have an idea why they might be susceptible . - To the cancer ? - The energy exchange that this man is creating , I don 't think it would work on everyone . Coretexiphan was designed to allow children to access untapped parts of their brain , untapped energies . You 're saying that whatever he 's doing to his victims like , exchanging his illness , it could only work on Coretexiphan children ? Yes . I think so . So the question is , how does he know about the Coretexiphan trials and then how is he tracking those people down ? You said you and Bell never kept a list of the children you experimented on . Well , I didn 't , and if Belly did , I never saw it . Okay , but what about Nina Sharp ? She started working with Bell around the same time . We asked . Last year . When Harris was tracking down Nick Lane and Nancy Lewis . She doesn 't have a list . Yeah , but I believe that Nina Sharp isn 't always so forthcoming . Why would someone be hunting Coretexiphan subjects ? I don 't know . Walter thinks that they could be particularly susceptible . - Ah . That 's troubling . - Did William Bell ever show you a list ? - Of Coretexiphan subjects ? - Mm-hm . - No . - And there 's nothing in the Massive Dynamic archives ? As I 've told you before , there 's nothing on record . - Do you doubt me , Agent Dunham ? - I don 't know . I 've always been a little foggy as to your motives . What are you implying ? You 've kept information from me since I met you . Information that 's prevented me from understanding the origin of many , if not all of the cases I 've investigated while with Fringe division . And I know about Peter . I know the whole story . Does Peter know ? Have you told him ? No . But I 'm going to . - No . You won 't . - What makes you so sure about that ? Because you haven 't told him yet . And I 'm guessing you 've had any number of opportunities . Well , I 've had my reasons for waiting . This is the right thing to do . Peter needs to know the truth . Whether or not it 's the right thing to do I recognize a look in your eyes . I know that working together closely with someone can bring about feelings . I 'm fairly certain that you 're not prepared to lose him . You didn 't come here today to ask me about a list that you already knew I don 't have . And you didn 't come here to announce that you were going to tell Peter who he really is . You came here to have me talk you out of it . - Mrs. Lane ? - Yes . I 'm sorry to disturb you . I tried calling . My name is John McHugh . I went to school with your son , Nick . No , Nick is my nephew . Oh ... Uh ... You look awful . Why don 't you come inside ? Thank you . The red wire goes in the red hole . - The blue in ... - Yes , thank you , Walter . I was able to figure that out all by myself . Hey . How 'd it go ? Nina didn 't have anything . - How 's it going here ? - Well , we 'll soon see . Don 't be so skeptical , Peter . You liked the taffy , didn 't you ? Heh . Absolutely . - I have my doubts . Ready ? What 's it doing ? Familiarizing itself with the genetic composition . Dismissing any foreign elements . Amazing how much filth we carry around on our hands . Go ahead , dear . It worked . - Of course it did . Astrid , we need to run this through the joint law-enforcement database . See if we can get a name for this guy . Well done , Walter . Thank you , son . Nothing . He 's not in our system . No priors , no arrest record . So we 're nowhere . LANE : You said you went to school with Nick . A long time ago . Back in Jacksonville . We have a mutual friend , Lloyd Becker . He said I could find Nick here . I remember Lloyd . Oh . Such a sweet boy . Nick lived here a while after his parents died . He moved to Brooklyn several years ago . Do you ... ? Do you know how I could get in contact with him ? - Do you have his phone number ? - I 'm afraid not . I haven 't heard from him for some time . It 's funny , though . Someone else from Jacksonville came by , oh , six months ago asking for Nick . She must 've gone to school with you as well . You don 't , by any chance , remember her name , do you ? God , what am I missing ? - Dunham . - I think I may have found our killer . His name is James Heath . And he was a Coretexiphan subject too . I think that may be how he 's doing this . James Heath . Wasn 't Heath the last name ... ? Yeah . Of the first victim , Julie Heath . She was his sister . James was in the hospital . She was visiting him , and she just suddenly collapsed and died . He was , uh ... He was having chemo treatment . He had cancer . Do you have the name of the hospital ? Yeah . It 's Abington Memorial Hospital . It 's just outside Philadelphia . Okay . I 'll see if they have a current address for him . Okay . JAMES : You 're Olivia Dunham . You probably don 't remember me . My name is Nate Reed . Nick Lane gave me your address . You and I went to school together when we were kids back in Jacksonville . - I see . What can I do for you ? I was hoping you 'd have a few minutes to talk . Sure . Why don 't you come in ? - Hello ? - Peter . Peter , it 's me . He 's in my house ! You stay down . I didn 't want this . I didn 't wanna hurt anyone . Then why did you ? A man came to see me when I was in the hospital . He said when I was a kid scientists had experimented on me . That because of the experiments , he could teach me how to fight the cancer . But it didn 't work . I didn 't get better , I got worse . So , what happened to your sister ? She stayed with me while I was in the hospital . She never left my side . And when the pain got bad , she 'd hold my hand , for hours . And then one day it just happened . I called the nurses for help but it was too late . I watched her die . But you got better . I had to find that man . I thought someone from Jacksonville might know him . And then I found Timothy . - And you killed him too . - Not on purpose . It just happened . But that 's when I realized how it worked . I think if that man had never come to see me I would 've died the way I was supposed to . And my sister would still be alive . They 'd all still be alive . COP : In here ! - It 's okay . How come you didn 't call Broyles ? - I 've got you on speed dial . - Really ? I 'm number one on Olivia Dunham 's speed dial ? Well , no , but I didn 't think that Rachel or Mr. Lyer from the Indian takeout would be much use . Peter thank you for coming . You 're welcome . He 's in a drug-induced coma which seems to have stopped the progression of his cancer . And the man who tried to activate him ? Do we know who he was ? He sounds like the same man who Sanford Harris hired to activate Nancy Lewis and Nick Lane . I assume the activation failed and Mr. Heath 's ability was just an unfortunate side effect . - Hm . So I don 't imagine you called me all the way down here just to share in your victory . Aside from Olivia Dunham there are still nearly a dozen unaccounted-for people from the Jacksonville experiments . And 30 more from the trials in Wooster . If they all have capabilities like the ones we 've seen and if someone were to find them ... - Well , Phillip then we need to find them first . - Agent Dunham . Hello . - Hey . - Is Peter here ? - No . No , he went out . Good , because I would like to talk to you . - Agent Dunham ... - Walter , please . Please , Walter . Just let me finish . I think that you may be right . I think that maybe some truths can do more harm than good . And that some Pandora 's boxes are better left unopened . So I 'm not gonna tell Peter . Thank you , Olivia . The truth is I 've done enough damage and it 's time to start to put things right . Whatever the consequences . And that starts with telling Peter the truth . I have to tell him who he really is .

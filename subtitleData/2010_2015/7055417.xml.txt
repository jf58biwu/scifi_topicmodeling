Brother Sister Kyousou { \ cHEAFEF5 } gi { \ cH000000 } ga Chapter 17 : The Present ( 11 ) / Siblings isn 't it ? It all ended up like the Priest said . I guess I 'm the only one laughing . I won 't laugh . Our mother had a mirror just like yours . Where 'd you get it ? Borrowed it . Without permission . It 's actually my dad 's . but he wouldn 't give it to me . I wanted to have something that would connect me to my mother . It 's not fair that Sensei gets her all to himself . I always called my dad " Sensei " ... It 's a habit that 's hard to break . I see . Want to see his face ? Look ! Isn 't he cool ? The face is similar . So 's the color of the eyes . But the age difference is too great . He 's too young . he hasn 't changed for as long as I 've known him . do you have any pictures of Mom ? 1 ) } Koto She 's really pretty ! So that picture in Yase 's house was Mom ?

There 's no doubt about it . She 's our little sister ! it 's certainly worth testing . Test what ? Why do you think the things she destroys don 't regenerate ? Her weapon ... was it ? Shouko-kun tells me that it creates the same kind of power that this place does when something is recreated . Perhaps it 's similar to a magnet . they repel and knock each other away . the stronger the binding . if nothing else . to investigate these coincidences and all my hypotheses and theories . I think it 's time to go fishing again . It 's been a while . That 's ... your beloved mother will return and I will open the door out of this place . I 'm not sure it 'll be that easy . correct ? Looks like this will be quite the lively festival . Kyousou { \ cHEAFEF5 } gi { \ cH000000 } ga Chapter 18 : The Present ( 12 ) / Festival they aren 't going to grant anything .

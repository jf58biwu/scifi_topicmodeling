 Previously on warehouse 13 ... What 'd that have to do with me being pregnant ? Well , I 've been thinking , you know , Am I ever gonna have a family ? When it happens for real , I think that you 'll make a pretty great mom . - You have been lying to me . Your sister ... she 's an incredibly dangerous woman . I haven 't forgotten about claire . I want to know about my sister . - My whole life has been a lie . A little bit dramatic , don 't you think ? Steve , if you found out , suddenly , That your sister was still alive , It would be a pretty big deal for you , no ? By about infinity , because the guy who 's been lying to you About it is the only real father figure You 've ever known . - Okay , your life is worse . Congrats . But I 'm sure that artie Had a good reason . - Yeah , me too . This was a warehouse case . Look at the angle of the wreck . Have you ever seen a car fling itself into a tree From a dead stop ? - Okay , so what do we do ? Now that I know it 's warehouse , I 'd say give me a couple hours to decrypt the classified files , And we can get to work . - Or you could let me show you . And that is the best gay news website that I 'm ... Hey , artie , is that a new brown jacket ? - All right , all right . I know that you 're researching claire . And I also know no stern words or dire warnings Are gonna stop you , so ... I 've decided to show you claire myself . What ? What 's the catch ? - There 's no catch . This way I can keep an eye on you . - Is he lying ? - No , he is not . - Stop staring at me . I understand you 've been given a clean bill of health . Yes , short of an occasional checkup , I am free and clear . - Oh , good for you . What about children ? is there still an option ? - Well , I , uh ... why do you ask ? Well , sometimes in an event such as this , A woman can reevaluate her priorities , Ask herself if ... There 's more to life While there 's still time . - Oh . Ah ... Oh , no , mrs . Frederic , I am 100 % here . I am committed to my job . I 'm not really looking for anything more . - Understood . But there 's no need to close that door forever . Possibilities are what make life interesting . First I would have to find someone that I 'm in love with Or someone I-I 'd at least consider The possibility of having kids . - What about me ? - What ? Pete . Right . See ? I already have a child . No , I mean you could have kids with me . - Ah . - We could totally do it Without even having sex . - That 's enticing , But ... Mrs. F ... And poof ! - Whoosh . She 's gone . How convenient . I wish I could do the same . - Okay , how about this ? If in ten years neither of us has found anyone ... - Oh , a murder-suicide pact ... Yes , that 's a great idea . Look , can we stop talking about this and just get back to work ? Hopefully , we 'll find an artifact that will kill us Before I have to do it myself . Who told you kicking someone 's butt is the way to win his vote ? Come on , congressman , if I let you win , You wouldn 't be able to trust me at all . No , but I 'd like you a lot more . The point is , my clients have done the research And provided the data . Fracking is absolutely safe . We all have to live in this world to ... - Gavin . What the hell ? Gavin ! Somebody get help . What ? Simkins and meyer ! What ? Bering and lattimer ! Both : Hey , hey , hey ! - Hey . - Hi . How are you ? - I 'm doing great . - Good to see you . Hey ! Oh , my , gosh , myka , you look great . - You too ! - Oh , my , gosh . You just disappeared into south dakota . We couldn 't find anything out . Yeah , but you tried , though , didn 't you ? - No , not about that ... About you two . - What ? That whole museum thing , the guys at the office Had a pool going ... hook up or kill each other . oh , well , neither one so far , But I wouldn 't rule out both . What about you , partner ? - yeah . - Yeah . - Uh , huh . So what are you guys doing here ? Is the victim a v.I.P. ? No , no . His name 's gavin tager . Oil and natural gas lobbyist . But the vice president and two dignitaries were on site When it happened . - Okay , so ... Suspicious incident , v.I.P.S all around , right ? Must have set off some alarms . Yeah , we 're looking at a biological agent ... Eco or foreign terrorism . The victim 's lungs spontaneously filled with fluid , And there 's this . - What is that ? Sand . - Yeah . Coughed it up with the water . All right , so what are you guys thinking ? Since he 's in the oil business , This is some kind of twisted message or ... Maybe . We want to know what you guys are thinking . We heard you were into weird woo-woo kind of cases . - Ohh ... - ¶ woo - ¶ ah - so , uh ... We figure we 'll share intel Till we can put any terrorism fears to bed . So , for now , we are all partners . - Huh ? Huh ? Excellent . Artie , what is this ? Is claire in the warehouse , Or are you just not taking us to her ? Patience , and all will be revealed . - I 've heard about those . Pete and jane went into her memories with them . Artie , I don 't have a ton of memories of claire . I mean , I was seven years old . I didn 't see my parents die , so ... - I ... I did . I did . You 're right , claudia . This was a warehouse case ... My case . You and I are both going back into my memories . You 're gonna find out what happened to claire . And that 's supposed to replace you taking me to her ? I mean , you got her dna . You know where she is . How about we just start with this , And hopefully you 'll understand why I did what I did , And then I won 't have to put up with being stared at by steve For the rest of my life . I might still do that , though , just for fun . - Okay , you know what ? - All right , okay . You keep an eye on us while we 're in there . And , you , follow my instructions , for a change . Remember , the danger of using these shoes Is that we get seduced by the memories So we don 't want to come out . You and I are going in there together So that we both make it out . Understood ? Yes . Let 's do this , please . It 's okay . You 're not really here . Help me ! This is claire 's school ... her first incident . Claudia ... This will be disturbing . - Help ! - Claire , please stop . Please , claire ! Stop . Please ! - Claire ? help me ! Aah ! Help ! ¶ Energy freedom through hydraulic fracturing act . Oh , fracking ... drilling for natural gas . - Yeah . - So this is the bill That tager was trying to get passed ? That 's right ... increases fracking on protected lands . - Did he have any enemies ? Was anyone vehemently opposed to this bill ? A few ... environmentalists , Rivaling oil gas companies , opec . - Right . - Say , elise ? - Yeah ? I was wondering , uh ... You busy tonight ? I thought maybe we could catch up on old times . Uh , can 't . Sorry . I have a , uh , thing . a thing ? Yeah , well , I mean , I got a thing too . I thought maybe we could combine our things . - Oh , my thing 's private . In fact , um , ooh , I should get going to my thing right now . right . Okeydoke , I 'll be here , alone with my thing . Okay , so , uh , catch up with you guys tomorrow ? - Sure . - Great . - What 'd you say to her ? - Nothing ? I asked her out , and she turned me down , Which I find highly suspicious . Hey , but don 't worry ... me hitting on other women Does not change my offer of platonic childbearing . I liked it better when you just stared at my boobs . I can do both . Whoa ! Just did . I 'm kidding . Mykes , hey . You freeze some eggs . I 'll freeze some sperm . It 's all done with ice-cube trays and turkey basters . Oh , no , of course , mrs . Evans . Ha ! Well , I completely understand . Mm-hmm . Matter of fact , I have your letter with me right now . Yeah , I 'll take it up with my staff First thing in the morning . Oh , not at all ! It 's what you sent me to washington to do . Now you take care . It 's a good week for indoor drownings . A senator this time ... Honorable john wilton , of missouri . Yeah , I heard . Field office wants some answers . - Is that a parking ticket ? Why didn 't your service plates stop the ... - Yeah , I 'll get that fixed . I got it running errands last night . So I , uh , pulled wilton 's phone records . His last conversation was with a constituent ... harriet evans . Wrote to him about a zoning issue . Said he promised he 'd look into it . - Yeah , that 's the letter . I think she 's gonna be pretty disappointed With her senator 's follow-through . - Oh , yeah . - Salt . - How 's that ? Nothing . Uh , pete and elise Are interviewing the senator 's staff . We should get going . - Yeah , sure . Yes , the senator ruffled some feathers , but ... uh ... Thank you . Please . Senator wilton was one of the natural-gas industry 's Most ardent supporters . He and mr . Tager interacted on a daily basis . Then we 'll need the senator 's calendar To compare with tager 's , ms ... - Uh , diane hewlett . I 'm the senator 's ... Uh , I was the senator 's chief of staff . I 'll get the calendar . - Thank you . Please don 't let him touch anything else . - Hey ! - Hey . - Hi . - Hey . - So ... - So ... - So ... - I know we said share ... - Promise to call As soon as we get a lead ... - share alike ... We get it ... yeah , we should check with the field office . We 're all good . - Okay , great . - Great ! - Awesome . - Cool . - So get this . I found dried salt on senator 's wilton 's car . Salt , sand ... I think these people are drowning in sea water . So what ? A violin from the titanic , A chariot wheel from the red sea ... teddy kennedy 's turn signal . - Huh . Look , I got , um , artie to overnight an artifact So we would have something to counter the drowning effect . If we can stay ahead of this guy and find out who 's next . Now , wilton and tager were both in favor of the same policies . Someone doesn 't like natural gas . - You mean besides you ? - I will cut you . - Yeah . - Did you know them ? No . This is as close as I got . I want to hear what they 're saying . - We can 't . We can only go where my memory can take us . Listen , I 've got to check her gym locker still , But it doesn 't look like It must be quite powerful to have such a lasting effect . I want to discuss this with the regents . Good . I 'll finish up here and meet you at the car . Arthur , remember , she 's highly volatile . Do not engage until we know what we 're dealing with . Right . Announce that I 'm a secret government agent , And the next object she hurls might be me . - Precisely . So do you take over wilton 's seat now that he 's gone ? I will keep his office functioning Until the governor names a replacement . But I have no interest in being the senator from missouri , If that 's what you 're asking . - Why not ? Power , money , prestige ? - No , thanks . I have done my time in this town . This is the same copy of the bill that gavin tager had ... Fracking rights . Senator wilton was one of the cosponsors of the bill . Gavin was helping draft the language . How many cosponsors are there ? - About ten other senators . Okay , we 're gonna need all their names , Right now , please . Ten senators , ten possible targets . Yeah , all hands on deck . I 'm gonna call ted . I 'm gonna do the same with elise . - Straight to voice mail . - Yeah , her too . Mykes , why would they turn their phones off If they were just stopping by the field office ? Why would they ever turn their phones off ? You know , earlier today , ted was really evasive About this parking ticket . When I asked him about it , he actually hid it away . Yeah , well , elise refused to go out with me , Said she had a thing . Pete , I hate to even think this , But a pair of secret service agents ... They might be the perfect people to commit these crimes . They had access to the health club , To the senator , but why ? We 'll ask them after we stop them From drowning their next victim . Do you remember where that ticket was from ? - Judiciary square . Pete , that 's their car . Maybe the next victim 's a judge Who 's in favor of fracking . - In and out . - Yeah . - Hands where I can see them . - Oh ... - Hold it right there . - What the hell ? - Wait . What are you guys doing ? - What 's that , huh ? Instruction label from the first life raft ? Wait . What are you talking about ? It 's a certificate of marriage . - What ? - Um ... They just got married in the ... in the courthouse . All right , fine . Sorry . God , you guys have been acting so weird , you know , Giving each other all these signals and stuff . Yeah , you both had your cell phones off during a case . Oh ! I get it . So that 's , uh ... that 's why you wouldn 't go out with me . - Yeah , that 's why . - Sorry . We just ... we had to keep it quiet , you know ? I mean , you guys know how the agency feels If two agents get involved in a relationship . I hate to break this up , guys , But we 're gonna have to explain later . There 's been another victim . - Oh , boy . Oh , my god . This is ... - claire , come on , let 's go . No . You said we were just going for a walk . - Honey , come on . - No ! You 're sending me away . I 'm not going . Please , honey , we just want you to talk to a doctor . No one 's sending you away , baby . - You 're lying , both of you . Please , honey , just get in the car . No . I don 't believe you . I 'm not going anywhere with you ! - L-listen , we s ... we should go . - No , artie . - You ... really , you don 't know . I do . I need to see this . All right , you know what ? That 's it . I 've had enough . - No ! I remember coming in to find out if you were okay . Hi . You 're claudia , right ? Something bad happened , didn 't it ? You d ... you didn 't see anything , did you ? I heard it . It sounded bad . - Huh . It was the music box , wasn 't it ? It made claire mad . - Frances farmer 's music box . H-how did you know ? - I just knew it was bad . You 're right . It was . It was very , very , very bad . And you are a very special girl . Did you find the artifact , arthur ? Frances farmer 's music box causes telekinetic outbursts ... - Triggered by anger . Uh , I 've given claire a sedative . She must come with us . And I 've asked the neighbor to watch claudia Until a relative arrives . Claudia , do ... do you have a-a favorite toy ? Would you run and go get it ? She intuitively recognized the artifact . - Rare . We must keep our eyes on her . - She 's a very special girl . - What happened to claire ? The music box ... it infected her . But it was destroyed , so we had no artifact to neutralize . So it stayed in her permanently . - We tried everything . We tried artifacts , antipsychotics ... Nothing worked . The only solution was to put claire In an artifact-induced coma . I wanted you to see we had no choice . Is claire being like this my fault ? Artie , did I throw the music box into the fire ? You weren 't in the room . It 's not in your memories . - Claudia , it doesn 't matter . - It matters to me ! I want to see things from my memories now . Oh , what possible difference could it make ? you guys okay ? You were starting to get pretty agitated . What happened ? Why 'd we come out ? Claudia , I think it was your mind That was blocking the memories . Remember , it 's a very emotional day for you . You lost ... you ... All right , so let me talk to my partner , And I 'll get back to you , okay ? Thanks . Hey . So the guy 's name is freddy olin . He 's a real-estate investor . He bought and sold high-end listings . Now , his assistant said he was on the phone with a buyer When he said , and I quote ... - Any connection to the others ? - No . No , the guy 's not political . I asked his assistant where freddy stood on fracking . She thought I meant on battlestar and giggled . So ted and elise aren 't the only thing We were completely wrong about today . Yep . We 're two for two . - How 'd we miss it ? Well , good partners are good partners . Let 's go . - Hey . - Hey . So , um , until abt a year ago , This guy was a bartender . - Yeah , worked at the pool bar At the palladium hotel . From frozen margaritas to a cheesy mcmansion ... That 's a pretty big jump . God , the palladium hotel sounds familiar . Yeah , that 's where we talked about putting up your mom . - No , that 's not it . - Yeah , it is . We were gonna put her up at the other one . - I know the other one was ... - no , remember , I told you She doesn 't like the pools . - Yeah , the other place , Then we went to the palladium ... - guys , guys ! - Can we just go check it out ? - Yeah . - Sure . - It was the ... - it was not the same one . - It was the same one . - She said that she wanted ... And also , she said that she ... - no ... No , no , no , freddy ... he just up and quit one day . He kept talking about a big inheritance from his aunt . Lucky bastard , right ? Well , I mean , you know , until today . - Uh , pete ? - Yeah ? Wow . Nice place . Hey , you got a ... ? Diet coke , please ... Ice cold . - Yeah . - Thank you , dolores . - Thanks . - Hmm . So how did you and ted happen ? Oh , uh , I don 't know . We were partners for years . And then one day we kind of just looked at each other and went , " wow . We 're partners . " - It just made sense . We had a shorthand . We had each other 's backs . We 're the most important person in the world to each other . And then I had a kind of scare . A scare ? What kind of scare ? Um , I thought I was pregnant . Oh . I mean , oh ... - I wasn 't . - Right . - You know ? But it just makes you reevaluate your priorities . Like , what do you want in life , you know ? - Yeah . So we decided to tie the knot . Wow . Seriously , dude , I 'm ... I 'm really happy for you . And , uh , I promise you , your secret is safe with us . - Hey , thanks , man . - Yeah . - So how about you guys ? I mean , come on , anybody can feel that vibe . - What ? - Yeah . - Me and mykes ? - Yeah ! No . No . Seriously , no . I mean , we care about each other , but ... No . No , no . - All I 'm saying is , That 's what we said , and one day you just wake up , You realize exactly what you want Is staring you right in the face . - Hey . - What ? - What ? Nothing . What ? - Nothing . - All right . - Oh , my god . - Elise ? - That 's it . That 's ... that 's what familiar , the logo . - Yeah , honey , ' cause this is ... - do not start . She does not like pools . The room service here is fantastic . Hey , guys , wait . This hotel ... It was in the news about year ago ... Some sort of political scandal . Pete , come on . - See ? - And your mom was gonna ... Ow ! So julia helmsworth disappeared last summer . An anonymous tipster said that they saw her here Partying at the hotel pool With her boss , senator dean kelton . The media went bananas , and they said that they thought That he was either sleeping with her Or there was blackmail or that maybe he killed her . Yeah , but it was all speculation , Even though it ended up ruining his life . I mean , I-it broke up his marriage . He lost the reelection And eventually he killed himself . Right . And our dead bartender , Aka anonymous tipster , Got his inheritance at the same time . Whoa , mykes . Check this out . Senator wilton , the guy they found dead in his car ... - Yeah . - He 's the same guy Who won that election and took over kelton 's seat . - So our victims Ruined kelton to win an election , And someone I-is taking them out . Yeah , but who 's the next victim ? - Uh ... I 'm gonna bet on nancy malloy ... The reporter that broke the story first . - Artie , I want to talk . - What do you want ? - Take me to the real claire . I want to use the baby shoes with her . Her memories can tell me what happened . No ! Absolutely not . It 's too dangerous . In perfect condition , the shoes can cause a psychotic break . We have no idea how they 'll interact With a mind like claire 's . - Artie , you started this . - To finish it ... And to show you that some things , claudia , Just can 't be fixed . - What aren 't you underst ... - claudia ... Through no one 's fault , I have been completely deprived of my own history , The truth about who I am and where I come from . I 'll leave it alone after this , I promise , But I need to know what happened . All right , listen , w-what about this ? Would you at least agree to letting me go instead of you ? And I 'll take the risk , and I 'll tell you what I find . No , no . I need to see this for myself . Well , then how I 'm supposed to keep you safe ? Keeping me safe is not your job . - Yes , it is ! It is precisely my job ! - I 'll go ! - What ? No ! Why ? No . What ? - Artie . Artie , I was thinking that maybe , Whether you meant it or not , It 's possible that you blocked claudia From seeing those memories to protect her ... Subconsciously . Subconsciously . Now ... I would be a neutral party . - Uh ... Uh ... - I 'll take that as a yes . - What is all this ? Joseph pilate 's resistance bands ... They keep her circulation active , And they keep her muscles from atrophying . Oliver sacks record player ... That 's what keeps her in a perpetual coma . Is she conscious , like in the bronzer ? No , no . As far as we know , she doesn 't even dream . This was the most humane thing we could do . What exactly are you insinuating ? We are not ... we are not insinuating anything , lady . We 're saying it outright . Freddy olin was paid to be your anonymous source . Look , your life may be in danger . Someone is getting revenge . Wilton , tager , freddy olin ... they 're all dead . We 're trying to keep you from being next . Sorry . You 're out of luck . I was just reporting a story . And if there was some vast conspiracy Against senator kelton , I had nothing to do with it . Now , if you 'll excuse me ... I have to get ready . - Mykes , she 's drowning . - Pete ... Silver from the mine 's of the atacama desert . It 's the driest place on earth . - Okay . - Okay , just breathe . - Good , good , good . - Okay . - You 're gonna be fine , okay ? Just breathe . Okay . Good . But why 'd she start drowning at that moment ? I mean , no one did anything to her . There was no artifact on her . She was just talking . Maybe it was something she said . The last thing that she said Was that she didn 't know anything About the conspiracy , right ? Right , which I 'm betting is a total lie . - A lie . A lie . There was a-a letter in ... in wilton 's car . He promised this woman he would look into an issue , And then he tore it up . Pete , maybe it 's triggered by lying . Well , that would be a perfect artifact , right ? 'cause the perp wouldn 't even have to be around When it happened . - Right . Um , guys , can you just hold up ? Thank you . - Thanks . Nancy , we think that you were attacked With sort of a , um ... a truth serum That reacts to your nervous system when you lie . Yeah , so do you want to tell us the truth this time ? Okay , freddy olin was paid to say That he saw senator kelton at the hotel with a girl . Were you paid too ? - Okay , good . Now , tell us who paid you , Because we think they 're next on that list . Hewlett , his chief of staff . - No one thought That senator kelton would kill himself . We were ... we were just trying to win an election . So that 's why you 're retiring ? I don 't have the stomach for it anymore . And what about julia helmsworth , The girl who disappeared ? No idea . Dead , for all I know . Wilton and tager and I heard about her disappearance , And we saw it as an opportunity . Oh , god . - All right . Now , we are gonna secure this office , And you are gonna tell me who else knew what you did So that we can find this guy . - Claire ... I don 't know if you can hear me Or if this is even gonna work , But I need to see something maybe only you know . So , if you can hear any of this , Try to focus on the music box . I need to see what happened to the music box . I 'll be monitoring her vitals . First sign of trouble , I 'm pulling you both out , understood ? I 'll make sure we get home okay . - All right . Where are we ? Did it work ? - I-I don 't know . This looks like some kind of yard sale . Claire , is this the right place ? Hey , don 't electrocute yourself , okay ? I 'm the one who 's gonna get in trouble . I don 't need you to protect me . I 'd know that ' tude anywhere . - Fixed it . - It 's the music box . It worked . Claire took us here . Claire , that thing 's bad . You should put it down . No , it 's not bad , claudia . It 's just old . I want to see if it works . Claire . Claire , put it down . I don 't like it . Well , good . Then you 'll leave it alone . Okay , let 's go . Come on . - Here you go , sweetheart . - Thanks . What , you 're still not done with that ? Oh , no , no , no . No , you did the eye-roll thing When I said I remembered the hotel . I did not do the eye-roll thing . You so did ! I 'm just sorry That you feel threatened when I 'm right . - You want to hit me again ? - Kind of . You know , I am so glad that we have boundaries . Work is work , and personal 's personal . It 's much better that way . - Boundaries , yep . We work together every day And live next to each other in a bb . You know , I still wish that you would close your bathrobe In the morning . That 's involuntary , myka , okay ? All guys wake up like that . - Is that a weapon ? - A long time ago . It 's just a souvenir now . See ? Veterans affairs gave it to me years ago . I guess I 'm just thinking about more honorable times . All right , well , just , uh ... Just don 't turn this into a suicide watch , hmm ? - Don 't worry about me . - That hotel Is also where we talked about putting up your mom . had to have the last word . Don 't think I didn 't catch that thing between you and pete . What ? That was before we even knew each other . And what about you ? You were ogling girls At the pool , like , before the ink had even dried On our marriage certificate . - I was not ! - Ted , ted . - Hey ! This is special agent elise meyer . I need an ambulance at the russell building . Got an agent down . hewlett took off . - What is that ? - Something that will help him . Ted , listen to me . I need you to relax . Okay , now , did hewlett do anything ... anything strange ? Did she have any strange objects ? part of sword ... Broken , just the hilt , Military , ceremonial . - Just the hilt . Okay . Breathe . Pete ? - Just the hilt , right ? There 's a little statue in paris . It 's , like , world war I-ish , right ? I saw it a few years ago . It 's , uh , uh , alfred , uh ... - Alfred dreyfus ? - Yes . Falsely accused of spying ... the dreyfus affair . That 's right . That 's right . And during the ceremony where they stripped him of his rank , They snapped his sword in half . Now , the ... the statue is of him holding this broken sword . - Right . - But I can 't figure out The connection to the salt water . He was imprisoned on devil 's island for ten years . The only escape was a nine-mile ocean swim . Okay , hello ? Hey ! So you 're saying that a ... that a broken old sword Is what made ted almost drown ? - No . - Yes . - Yes . - No ? Should I ignore the fact that that just sounds insane ? - Uh ... I mean , you 're welcome to giggle a little . But it 's ... it 's true . - Okay , let 's say we buy that . You 're also suggesting That hewlett is killing her cohorts . Why ? - Remorse . She said that she didn 't have the stomach for it anymore . Well , why now ? And why attack ted ? - My guess is , Is that she needed to finish the job . There still must be someone out there That she needs to punish . - That girl . - What girl ? From the paper ... um , uh , julia ... Both : Helmsworth . - Yeah . Myka , maybe she 's still alive . Honey , we 're sure your teachers are exaggerating . They 're lying . It makes no sense . We just want you to talk with someone . - You 're sending me away . You don 't like me anymore , so you 're getting rid of me . - It 's the music box . The music box is making claire bad . Everything 's fine , sweetie . Just put on your sweater . We 're gonna go for a little drive . - No , you 're lying to me . claudia , look . Maybe she doesn 't want to be here anymore . Just a little bit longer , claire . - I 'm not going . We 'll stay with you the whole time . You 'll come right home . You 'll see . - No . Please , claire , the music box is hurting you . Who cares about the stupid music box ? There , now it 's gone , okay ? What the hell happened ? You were all shaking . It wasn 't my fault . It wasn 't my fault . Claire threw the music box into the fire herself . - Oh , thank god . - She stayed , though . Even though she was in pain , She stayed long enough to show me . - Okay , thank you . Hey , um , I just talked to reagan general . Nancy malloy 's lungs are slowly filling back up with fluid . Okay , you 're gonna have to split the time with the necklace Between nancy and ted and just stick by him . Couldn 't get rid of me if he tried . All right , now , hewlett has to have some intel About julia helmsworth here . - Right . - Hey , hey , ted . Where did she get the hilt ? - Right there , desk drawer . - Here we go . - Okay ... Here . - Ah , ha ha ha ! Paper trail-a-palooza . - Okay . We have meetings with wilton and tager And payoffs to malloy and the bartender . - Mykes ? - Yeah ? Checks made out to julia helmsworth . - Bingo . - Julia , it 's okay . - Someone knows , don 't they ? You know , I never wanted to be a part of this . You people forced me into it . - That 's why I 'm here . Go and pack a bag . I 'm going to take you someplace safe . Julia , you trust me , don 't you ? - Freeze , hewlett ! - Who are you ? Julia , don 't say another word . - Hewlett , come on out , okay ? There 's no place else to go . - It 's okay . I 'm coming out . - Hewlett ! I 'm innocent . I haven 't hurt anyone . Hewlett ! Mykes , grab it . Liar . Well , sorry you couldn 't punish yourself . I guess we 'll see what a jury can come up with . So ted and elise wrote in their report That hewlett used an unidentified toxin On her victims . - Yeah , well , you know , We keep their secret , and they shall keep ours . sir . Good . - All right . All right , so , hey , mykes , um ... Speaking of partners who , you know , work things out ... - Pete . - What ? - No . - Don 't ... - Come on . - Wait , wait , wait , Wait , just ... just ... - I ... - Hear me out . - Okay . - Look , I know that I ...

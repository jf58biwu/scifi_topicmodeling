 13 Bannerman Road is where Sarah Jane Smith lives and it 's home to things way beyond your imagination . 'There 's an extra terrestrial super computer in the wall . 'Her son , a genetically engineered boy genius , 'a school girl investigator across the road , 'her adopted daughter from another world , 'and a whole universe of adventure , right here on the doorstep . ' Ready ? Always . Where were you the day of the storm ? You know the one I mean . No ... one 's ever going to forget that day . 'I was at school . ' So then , Clyde . Your starter for ten ... What are the parallels between the fall of the French aristocracy in the 1790s and the credit crunch of 2008 ? Well , Mrs Pittman always says history can teach us stuff about the present . Yeah ? Hey ! The Silver Bullet ? Every crook is a target in Blood River City . Hey , this is good . Do think so ? Yeah . Really good . Don 't see how he 'll get you through your exam . But this is what I 'm going to do when I finish school . Comics . The Silver Bullet 's just one idea . Wait till you see Susie June Jones , alien slayer . Susie June Jones . You 're joking . Tell me you 're joking . Well , Sky , I hope you 'll enjoy life at Park Vale . Luke certainly flourished here . I like to learn stuff . There 's lots I don 't know yet . That 's a very healthy attitude . These days , too many students think they know it all . Sky 's a keen student . Clyde says I 'm a bright spark . What on Earth ? ! Haresh , there seems to be a trout on your windowsill . Excuse me , Sarah Jane , Sky . Some of our pupils have an over ... developed sense of humour . Did you hear that ? What 's that ? Boy ! What 's this all about ? Now this looks dead fishy . Mr Smith , I need you ! Yes , Sarah Jane . How can I help you ? Have you got a good recipe for the biggest fish pie in history ? I have been monitoring reports of the unusual storm over London . I love this planet . When you think you get fish in the sea , they start coming out the sky . There have been many reports of fish raining from the sky . There is a meteorological explanation . You mean it 's natural ? Storms and tornadoes suck fish out of the water into the upper atmosphere . They freeze , then later , they come raining down . But those fish are small . Wouldn 't satisfy next door 's cat . Mr Smith , the fish today , they were this big . No ? Well , still not natural . Mr Smith , I want you to scan for alien energies . Of course . And , Mr Smith , better cast your net pretty wide . Don 't encourage him . I 'm glad Sky turned up . Finally there 's someone here who appreciates my comic genius . Sarah Jane , you may be interested to know that the Museum of Culture is currently staging an exhibition of totem poles . Among them is what has become known as the Totem of the Lost Tribe . My dad wants to see that . Said they found in a cave , like it had been hidden . I still don 't get the connection . It was discovered in the Mojave Desert . A legend surrounding its discovery suggests when it was first removed from the cave , a storm came out of nowhere , and it rained fish . What 's in a museum ? Dead things , mostly . And people like to look at dead things ? Isn 't that a bit weird ? If you ask me , yeah . Museums help preserve our past , Sky . They 're fascinating places . You 'll see . Mum and Dad met in a museum . How romantic . Though I never saw your mum as the museum type . It was raining . You got any spare change ? Enough for a sandwich ? Please ? Yes , sure , here . Get a bacon butty or something . Cheers . Why did she want money ? Because she 's a scrounger . Why did you give her some ? Cos it 's probably not her fault . Isn 't it pretty ? I think the word you 're looking for is creepy . Look at those faces . There really shouldn 't be anything sinister about a totem pole . They were a kind of storybook carved from cedar trees to represent myths or family histories . Glad they 're not my family . You 're a funny ... looking bunch , aren 't you ? Ww ! Splinter ! We would rather you didn 't touch the exhibits . Sorry , Clyde didn 't mean any harm . Clyde Langer . I 'm sorry . I just love art . Even when it does bite back . Well , it looks like you came off worse . Did you get a splinter , you big baby ? My name 's Sarah Jane Smith . I 'm a journalist . Dr Samantha Madigan . I run the anthropology department here . I suppose you 've made the connection between the totem pole and fish raining from the skies ? It WAS the totem pole ? Of course not . She 's not really with us . My daughter has quite a sense of humour . Do I ? Have to say , I couldn 't have wished for a better publicity stunt . Maybe Hetocumtek is on our side . I 'm sorry ? Why Hetocumtek ? Legend says Hetocumtek was a vicious warrior god who descended from the skies and tried to enslave the people of the Great Plains . But , the story goes that the tribes greatest medicine men came together and tricked him , imprisoning him in a totem pole . This totem pole ? Well , ' tis only a story . Now , if you 'll excuse me ... So what do you think , Sarah Jane ? Hetocumtek ... warrior god or nasty alien ? Aliens masquerading as gods ? It wouldn 't be the first time . But I don 't really believe in the magical powers of medicine men ... and according to my scans , there 's no alien energy here . So if anything alien did cause today 's shower of fish , it wasn 't this totem pole or Hetocumtek . Gotcha ! Come on . Hello , love . Was that Sarah Jane giving you a lift ? Yeah , me and Rani were helping her mum at the shop and Sarah Jane dropped by . That 's nice . Did you see the fish ? Yeah . That 's school dinners sorted for the next week . Could 've come battered with chips , though . They 're saying it 's some freak weather . Anyway , I hate fish . When it 's raining chocolate , let me know . I 'll go and set the table . Who needs chocolate when I 've got my little Clydey ? The day it starts raining Clyde Langers , that 'll be a miracle . Sleep easy , Blood River City . The Silver Bullet is watching your back . The End . Clyde Langer . Step aside , Batman . Morning ! What 's the weather forecast today , then ? Raining cats and dogs ? Sunny and bright , apparently . Not a halibut in sight . Mr Smith hasn 't been able to find anything to suggest an alien energy . So maybe for once we can stand down . Do you want to meet a hero who never stands down ? The Silver Bullet ! Did you do this ? Of course . What do you think ? It 's good . It 's really good . Is this what you want to do ? I mean , after school ? Yeah , well , drawing 's about the only thing I 'm any good at , so ... Don 't do yourself down . You 're bright . But there 's no doubt art really is your thing ! And I love comics , so I thought , why not ? Look out , Stan Lee , here comes Clyde Langer . Rocket scientist or whatever is fine if you 're a super ... brain like Luke . But me ... What do you mean , " super ... brain " ? He is , isn 't he ? He 's a genius . Yes , but the way you say it , it 's a bad thing . As if there 's something wrong . No . Sorry , I didn 't mean anything like that . Luke 's my best mate . Are you all right ? No . To be honest , I 'm sick of the way you 're always making fun of my son . Sarah Jane , what 's going on ? All you 've ever done is tell him how uncool he was , what a geek , a freak he was . And all the time you 're wasting your time with rubbish like this ? ! My son is worth a hundred of you ! And I 've had just about as much as I 'm going to take ! Sarah Jane ? Get out ! Now ! Take your stupid comic book with you ! What 's going on ? I don 't get it . Get out ! This is crazy ! You want crazy ? I 'll give you crazy ! No ! Hey , what 's going on ? It 's Sarah Jane . She 's just gone completely mental . What are you talking about ? Clyde Langer ! You get away from me ! What ? Leave my daughter alone ! What 's going on ? What did I do ? I didn 't do anything ! Dad ... keep him away from me ! We 're mates . Keep away from her ! You 're no friend of my daughter . This is mad . We 're friends ! You 're mad if you think I 'd be any friend of yours . I hate you ! Rani ... I 'll give you ten seconds . I don 't want you anywhere near my daughter . Understood ? As far as school goes ... you 're excluded . You can 't do that . Something 's got at you . Both of you . And Sarah Jane . I don 't know what it is . But none of it 's real . Think about it ... please ! I haven 't done anything ! You 're out of time ! Come anywhere near me again , I 'm calling the police . All right , I 'm gone . But there 's something going on here . And I 'm going to fix it . You do what you like . But I don 't want to see you again ! Not ever ! Sarah Jane , are you all right ? Yes , Mr Smith . I 'm fine . I am detecting an exceptionally high oscillation of beta brainwaves suggesting intense anger . No , Mr Smith . I don 't think so . How curious . Your beta brainwave activity is now normal . Sarah Jane . How do I look ? You look marvellous ! I 'm so proud of you . Why ? Because I put the school uniform on right ? No , no . Because you 're on your way to school , and you 've barely been on Earth a month . And I know this must all seem so strange to you , but you 're very brave , Sky . Why do I have to be brave at school ? Will people try and hurt me there ? No . No . No ... one 's going to try to hurt you . Well , it will seem strange , and you 're going to be mixing with lots of new people . It 's going to be so exciting . You see , that 's what I mean . You 're going to be brilliant . Will you be lonely without me today ? Well , actually , I was thinking I might pay another visit to the museum . I thought you said the totem pole wasn 't alien . No , no , it isn 't . This is professional interest . Mr Smith , has anyone run a story on the mythological connection between the shower of fish and the totem pole ? It appears not , Sarah Jane . Perfect . While I 'm getting my scoop , you 'll be making new friends at school . And don 't worry , Rani will always be close by if you need her . And Clyde . You keep away from him ! Why ? Just do as I say . Keep away from him . Don 't go anywhere near him . Do you hear me ? ! Yes , Sarah Jane . I don 't ever want to hear his name again ! Excuse me , but has Clyde upset you ? And that goes for you , too ! In fact , I want you to put your sensors on a permanent scan for him . If he ever sets foot in Bannerman Road again , I want you to deal with him . Understood , Sarah Jane . Sky ! Come on ! School . Luke ? It 's Clyde . Look , I 'm getting freaked out here . Something 's ... Luke ... No , no , listen to me ! I 'm your friend ! There 's something ... It 's got to you , too . Luke ! This is not happening . This is not happening . Had enough of sixth form , then ? You all right , Steve ? So , what , too busy to come and play football with your mates ? Yeah . Sort of . I 'm sorry . How 's your job ... hunting going ? Yeah . Great . Got a Chelsea scout coming down this afternoon to watch me play , Quarter of a million a week , choice of my own WAG ... Girls Aloud , Saturdays , you name it . It 's brilliant , isn 't it ? I 'm sorry , mate . Fancy a kickabout ? Stuff to do . But , listen , Steve . It was nice to see you , man . No worries . Look , I tell you what , I 'll put in a good word for you . I 'll say , " Listen , Cheryl , I got a friend , Clyde Langer ... " He used to be all right . " Steve ? " Now in sixth form . Thinks he 's better than his mates . " No . No , you 've got it all wrong . You said my name ! They all said my name ! Steve ! Listen to me , OK . This is going to sound crazy , but there 's something wrong with my name ! It 's like it 's cursed ! We 'll fix that ! No , Steve . You don 't want to do this , OK ? This isn 't you . Just listen to me ... And that 's what I 'll do to you . Get him ! Stop him ! He 's getting away . Where did he go ? Got to go somewhere . Look , come on ! Now what ? Excuse me . Hi , Dr Madigan . Hello . Weren 't you here yesterday ? Yeah . Look , you 're an expert on totem poles and Native American stuff , right ? And stuff . Lots of stuff , yes . Do you know anything about curses ? Native American curses ? The most famous is the Curse of Tippecanoe . It was , or is , a curse on the Presidents of the United States . What about a curse that makes all your friends turn on you ? I 'm sorry ? I have to go . I 'd advise you to keep your distance from him . Sarah Jane , please , listen to me . This is some sort of curse . You 're serious ? You think you 've been cursed ? He 's a trouble ... maker . He 's clearly distressed . All day , every one of my friends has been turning against me . I think it 's something to do with my name . Don 't waste your time . Your name ? It 's Clyde , isn 't it ? No , don 't ! Clyde Langer . It 's not just people that know me . It 's everybody ! I think you 'd better leave . Or do I have to call security ? What did I tell you ? Is there a problem , Doctor ? Get him out of here . Right , out . No ! It 's the totem pole ! Oi ! That 's enough ! Get him , lads ! Sarah Jane ! Please remember me ! I 'm your friend ! Police ? I want to make a complaint . I 'm being harassed . Mum ? Mum ? Mum ... Where 've you been ? Just out . Why ? You 're always lying about where you 've been ... No , Mum ... More lies . Always lies . Mum , whatever you 're thinking , it 's not real . You 've seen my name . It 's messing with your head . Don 't touch me . How can I ever trust you ? Always skulking around , keeping secrets . But this isn 't real . I haven 't done anything . I don 't want you here . I don 't want to look at you , hear you . I feel like I 've had my soul torn out of me . I didn 't do this . It 's not my fault . Tell me what it is I 've done ! Tell me what I 've lied ... You can 't , can you ? You can 't because it 's all a trick . You 've all been tricked ... you , Sarah Jane , Rani . Everybody . Yeah , I was tricked , all right . Life tricked me . The day you were born . I 've had enough now . And I want you out of here . Out of my life ! No ! You don 't mean that ! Mum , I love you . Please , don 't do this . Police , open up . Don 't answer it ! And you wonder why I want you out of my life ? I haven 't done anything . It 's the curse ! It 's taking everything over ! He 's through there . We 're not alone now . We got each other . 'Clyde , you are brilliant . ' ' We are a team , Sarah Jane . ' Are you all right ? Come with me . Sleep all right ? What was he thinking , kipping in the rain ? I 'm Ellie Faber . I 'm Enrico . Enrico ... Box . What did he do to upset you so much ? Listen to me , Sky , and remember , I don 't want to hear his name again . According to our guard , lightning burst out of the totem pole . That 's impossible . It might be best if you close the exhibition for a while . He was your friend . No ... one can say why you all turned on Clyde . I don 't feel well . Something about that totem pole is alive . I saw it . Everything you were , wanted to be , it gets worn away till there 's nothing left . I 've lost something special , I don 't know what it is . Just be glad he 's gone . But Clyde 's your son , don 't you love him ? I told you , don 't say that name . Something bad 's coming and it 's always in the leaves . And it 's put its mark on you ... and everyone that knows you . Subtitles by Red Bee Media and Mecano

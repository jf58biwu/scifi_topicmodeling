 I fear I may not survive this war reenactment . I can 't believe we 're only 12 feet from the parking lot . This is every bit as fun as the real Civil War . Not the Civil War , Private . We 're reenacting the Sith-Al War . Sith ? What the Hoth ? Enemy invaders up in yonder sky ! I am Darth Stroyer . Darth Stroyer ? That 's the stupidest name I 've ever heard . Let 's hear the rest . Darth Trocious . Darth Sploder . Darth Urderer . Darth It-head . Company , attack ! Don 't fire till you see the greens of their eyes . It saves on bullets . I shall rip out your heart and show it to you . It is done . The candle that burns twice as bright burns half as long . Mm-hmm . Whoa ! You 're dead . No , I 'm just very old . Whoa , that 's good acting . It 's payback time , Sploder . Tell my mother ... to pick me up outside Quizno 's . That 's three dead . Whoa-ooh . Let 's pick up the pace , people . At this point in the actual war , the death toll was 98 million . You humans and your fragile organs . One little stab to the goo , and ... You 're dead , Earth man . Oh , cruel fate , I 'm dead . They 're putting me in my Sunday suit and shoving me in a wooden box . Now they 're lowering me into the cold , cold ground . Hello , here come the worms . If you were really dead , you wouldn 't be laughing so hard . Yeah , yeah , death 's a big deal to you flesh bags , but in case you didn 't notice , I 'm a robot . So ? What if something heavy fell on you , like a church ? You could still die . Nuh-uh . My wireless backup unit saves a copy of me every day , so if my body gets killed , big whoop , I just download into another body . I 'm immortal , baby . What ? ! Then how come you always scream so much when you 're in danger ? I never said I wasn 't a drama queen . And the winner of the war is ... Ah , let me just cross-check my tabulation here . Factor in the corsages for the widows ... Hurry up , you number - crunching crumbnuncher . Everybody but me is dying of old age . Okay ... ah . The winners , at a net cost of only $ 12 per life cut tragically short , our Sith overlords . Hot diggity . Oh , I mean ... Supreme diggity . Good war , good war , good war ... It may have been a fake war , but my scuffed knee is all too real . I 've got pains in joints I had removed a century ago . Bender , bring me my soft chair with the wheels on it . Your wheelchair ? I don 't need a wheelchair ! The one with the wheels . Poor flimsy humans . Don 't you wish you were flawless like me ? A towering inferno of physical perfection ? I hate to pop your blimp-like ego , but you are not perfect . Am so . Are not . Is too . Says who ? Says the only human whose opinion I even remotely respect . Inspector Five , the best inspector a kid could want . The day I was built , he looked me over , probably with tears of pride in his eyes , and proclaimed to all the world , by means of this scrap of paper , that I was perfect and infallible in every way . Hey , Mr. Perfect , you wet the chair . Huh ? Wasn 't me . Must be some of that urine you 're all so proud of . That 's not urine ; it 's oil . Impossible . I 'm triple-sealed to prevent any chance of ... You call that an ink defense ? Good-bye , friends . What could have caused the leak ? Excessive heat , on account of I 'm so hot ? Alas , no . Oh , Bender , I 'm afraid it 's a symptom of a fatal defect . Eh , fatal , shmatal . If I die , I can just download my backup copy into a new , equally fabulous body . That 's just it . You can 't . You were built without a backup unit . There 's no backup copy of me ? That 's what I just said , you mortal coil . So , if I die ... You die , or as you put it ... Um , excuse me for a moment . No ... ! I can 't believe it ! I 'm gonna die ! How much time does he have left , Professor ? Between a minute and a billion years . Well , at least you can plan accordingly . Dying sucks butt ! How do you living beings cope with mortality ? Violent outbursts . General sluttiness . Thanks to denial , I 'm immortal . Damn it , I 'm supposed to be perfect ! Inspector Five gave me his blessing ! How could he bring me into this world , knowing I would die ? So you wish you were never born , maybe ? Yes , anything less than immortality is a complete waste of time . Then suicide it is . Step into my office . I 'll give you a nice Kevorking . Not until I hunt down Inspector Five and beat an explanation out of him . I 'm all for a good beating , but you 'll never find him . Product inspectors are bureaucrats , faceless bean-counters who blend into the woodwork . I beg to differ . Stinkin ' bureaucrats ... I hate ' em ! Then again , you might be able to find Inspector Five with the help of another seasoned bureaucrat . Hermes , old pal . Old pal ? 8.5 seconds ago , you said you hated me . Time heals all wounds . You know what ? I will help you , but only to prove I 'm not just a paper-pushing file jockey . Will you be taking your portable filing cabinet ? None of your beeswax . I 'll only be away an hour , but I 'm counting on you to do the all-critical filing in my absence . Shall we review alphabetical order ? ♪ A-B-C-D ... ♪ Get out of my office . Yes , I 'd like to request a death certificate . Sorry , that 's building C. The Central Bureaucracy maintains records on all bureaucrats . We should be able to look up Inspector Five . Application for ingress approved . And the other potential entrant ? Uh ... He 's my pencil sharpener . You betcha ! Proceed . I maintain a cubicle here for weekend getaways . Wow . Until now , I thought giant cubes were exciting . I did like the part where they screamed . This is mine , right next to the center square . Sorry , Hermes , I drank all your white-out . Once I log in , I can access Inspector Five 's profile . Damn it , it won 't go on ! That 's because you 're not me . Hooray , it won 't go on ! The bureaucra-scan won 't let anyone but the assigned bureaucrat log in . Identity confirmed . Also , you have a rectangular mass in your colon . That 's a calculator . I ate it to gain its power . You locate Inspector Five while I slip into my ass-kicking feet . Sweet file-not-found - of-Puegot Sound . His record 's been blanked . Aw , man . How am I gonna find some anonymous guy I don 't know anything about ? I recommend the men 's room at the TWA terminal . Okay , just file it alphabetically ... ♪ A-B-C-D ... ♪ Well , this requires a little extra thought . I 'm a natural . The information we need will be here , in the physical files . Those bastards won 't know what leafed through them . It 's on . No ! This is impossible ! Quit blacking out and look at this . Inspector One , Two , Three , Four , Six ! There 's no trace of Inspector Five ! But Five 's the one we want ! Maybe if I kicked the asses of Inspector Two , plus Inspector Three ... Addition never solved anything , Mon . Let 's cut our losses and go home . So I 'm doomed to die , and I 'll never even get to punch whoever 's responsible ? ! Oh , what 's the point ? ! Bender , no ! Suicide isn 't necessarily the answer . It 's not a suicide booth , you lard ass . It 's a phone booth . They have phones in booths now ? Finally , I don 't have to lug this cell phone around . Who the hell is this ? How did you get this number ? Is this the Robot Company ? 'Cause I have a complaint about a defective robot . His name is me ! A defective robot , you say ? Stay right there , dearie . I 'll have tech support take care of you . Well , things are starting to look up . Look up ! Who did you call , Dial-a-Bomb ? No , I just told the robot company I was defective . You dumb cocktail shaker ! Mom won 't allow a defective product to tarnish her good name ! She 'll kill you ! Big whoop . I 'll just download into a new ... Oh , right . If I die , I die . Speaking of which ... You 're right . You 're right . You 're right . That 's what you get for calling tech support . I can 't run anymore . I 'll have to skip . Just a few more feet . We have to get to that pile of dead bears by 7 : 38 . A pile of dead bears can only mean one thing . But what ? It 's the 7 : 38 ! Jump ! Ah , shoot ! Someone said shoot . Well , we 're boned . No , we 're not ! We just got to limbo . But I 'm not designed to bend that low . Not without limbo music . That 'll do it ! Ow ! Ow ! Ow , ow ! Ooh . We 're gonna get fired . Someone said fire . We did it ! 12 straight hours of limbo . I haven 't done that since my honeymoon . Hermes , Hermes , remember that flock of bats ? I sure do . That was fun . Where are we ? I have no idea . Hey , we 're just a stone 's throw from Tijuana . See ? Dios mio ! A rock has fallen here in the outskirts of Tijuana . Is it within the city limit ? I think , yes . Told you . Hey , you want to celebrate our escape ? Maybe grab a shot of tequila and take in a big-league cockfight ? Sure . No , wait . I was built in Tijuana . Maybe Inspector Five still works there . He better do some ' splainin before I mash up some face guacamole . He 's Mexican , I 'm Mexican . Let me handle this . Sus papeles , por favor ? Sí . Ouch-o ! Here are our passports , visas , and Homeland Security permission slips . Notarized and starched . Okay . I also would have accepted a bribe . Nice work , butterball . You know , I was in Italy last week . My birthplace . It 's closed ! There 's not even a shrine to me with a gift shop , selling piñatas of me ! End of the line , Mon . Come on , we can still catch a twi-night double-cockfight . No , wait ! What 's that in the Mexican garbage ? Looks like a half-eaten cheese diaper . No , next to that . A half-eaten employee directory . Inspector Five 's home address ! His ass-ias is gracias ! Where are you hiding , you coward ? ! Get out here and get murdered like a man ! Bender , I 'm afraid our search is at an end . He 's obviously long gone . Oh , yeah ? ! Well , maybe this is him in a costume ! I 'm gonna squeeze you out of there like Tijuana toothpaste ! Whoa ! Okay , Bender , you 're mortal . And okay , Inspector Five screwed up . But that just makes the time you have left all the more precious . Do you really to waste the rest of your life in a bitter , homicidal rage ? No ! Yes ! I don 't know ! Why ? Why did he do this to me ? ! All I wanted was a little quality control . But he didn 't care enough , and now I 'm gonna die ! I deserved better ! I 'm Bender , damn it ! I 'm Bender ! There , there , Mon . It 's gonna be okay . You are Bender , which is something Inspector Five will never be . You know what ? You 're right . He was just a stupid bureaucrat . A stupid , paper-pushing bureaucrat . A stupid I-dotting , chair-squashing ... Oh . No offense , Hermes . You 're not like that . I mean , you 're exactly like that , but you 're okay . In fact , I 'm putting you on the do-not-kill list . Come on , fellow mortal . We 're in Tijuana . I want to live a little . Help ! I 'm gonna die ! That 's the opposite of what I want ! Quick , run out the back ! I 'll hack into Inspector Five 's terminal and fake your death , so they 'll call off the kill-bots . You know that terminal is unhackable ! I 'm not leaving you , and that 's final ! Good luck , buddy . Bender terminated . Bender 's saved . Cease fire . Mom called off the attack , although I don 't see how it 's her . Someone said Howitzer ! Yay ! All right ! Yay ! Oh ... He did it ! And he 's not looking back at that cool explosion . He 's a hero ! What 's happening ? ! The phone 's been disconnected , the ship 's repossessed and Zoidberg 's getting overcooked ! Aw , aw , aw , aw ! Ah , this place never changes . Leela , what in the name of Jah happened ? ! Too much papers ! Not enough hiding plants ! It 's all right . This place just needs a one-hour bureaucratizing . You make it look so easy . I 've smoked a lot a paperwork in my day . Hey , Bender , did you ever find that inspector guy you were looking for ? Nah . But thanks to this knucklehead , I did find a new outlook on life . It 's precious and sacred , and you only get so many millions of years on this Earth . So let 's get brick-faced !

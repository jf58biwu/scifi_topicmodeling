 Cyclops ... Took you long enough . I came like you asked , somewhat reluctantly . Calling me up out of the blue like it 's an emergency ... as self-centered as usual , I see . It 's not like you had anything better to do . I 'm a lot busier than someone who who has the time to be running all over the Pacific islands with a beautiful woman . Don 't take her lightly , Cyke ... She 's tougher 'n most guys you 'll come across . What 's that supposed to mean ? Hey , if you two are going to start fighting , you can get off right now ! He 's certainly very serious . Not as much as me . Let 's get going . I 'm not a taxi driver ! Good , ' cause I wasn 't gonna pay you . How exactly do you two know each other ? Oh , we 're best buddies . Since when ? ! Cyke ! I 'm in a hurry . We need to get to Madripoor . Madripoor , huh ? That 's one infamous island ... I saw a plane headed in that direction on the radar while I was on my way here ... Did you not hear me say I was in a hurry , bub ? ! You do know what kind of place Madripoor is , right ? Madripoor ... an island off the coast of Asia . Pirates took it over a long time ago , and since then the place has been a go-to spot for all kinds of scum . An outlaw nation ... And it 's a split society . Split society ? Hightown , with its dazzling high-rises , and Lowtown , the very definition of a terrible slum . There 's no middle-class . The only thing the two have in common ... is crime . I get it . Since the previous owner of the island died from illness , his son , Kurohagi Hideki , has been running things . I 've heard rumors about some kind of huge wedding ceremony on the island ... But you two probably know more about that than me . Keep flapping that tongue , Cyke , and I 'll cut it off ! That 's Madripoor . If it was just Logan , I wouldn 't mind dumping him into the ocean off the coast ... Hey ! If we make any kind of regular landing , the crooks on that island will swarm us , take anything we had , and then kill us . Swing around to the eastern side of the island . It should be relatively safer there . You 're certainly knowledgeable . Yeah . A little . Thanks for the ride . I 'll see you two again , if you survive . This your first time here ? No , I 've been here before . What ? With my parents ... Sorry . Guess I hit a nerve . Wow , I guess you do have a kind side . Logan ! Hey ! I thought you said the eastern side was safer ? I was talking about the plane ! Outsiders need to stay out ! Let 's kill ' em ! Set an example ! Bastard ! I ain 't got time to waste with you ! Yukio ! I 'm taking off ! Try not to die ! How kind of you ! I might just cry tears of joy ! Now what ? What rock did you guys crawl out from under ? Seem a little different than that last bunch , though ... Why are you attacking me ? I-It 's how we usually treat outsiders ! Well , that 's real friendly of you . By the way , you know a guy named Kurohagi ? Oh yeah . You 're gonna die . Dammit ! What 's going on ? ! Dammit ! Come on ! Here we go ! Now then , let 's begin the welcoming party . You bunch sure got a rough sense of hospitality . So ? Am I the only guest at this party ? He 's a monster ! Logan ... no , Wolverine . An unexpected guest . Get him ! Cripes ! This is one hell of an island ! Why 'd you help me ? Ain 't outsiders supposed to be bad guys here ? You seemed pretty tough . So I thought maybe I could get you to work for us . I 'm not gonna work for anybody . Almost everyone on this island works for Kurohagi , in some way . But there are some people who don 't . That 's us . What 'd you say ? ! We don 't work for him ... Before that ! Almost everyone works for Kurohagi ... You know about Kurohagi ? Of course ! Where is he ? ! What 're you gonna do if I tell you ? That 's none of your business ! Could we be after the same thing ? Did you come here to kill Kurohagi ? Were you hired by somebody ? Or is it a personal grudge ? This ain 't an interview . Tell me where to find Kurohagi ! Fine ! Fine ... Stop trying to scare me ! You 're scary enough without trying ... In Hightown . Look over there ... That brightly lit , conspicuous building ... Kurohagi 's there , at the Dragon Palace . Dragon Palace ... Splendid ! Excellent . The former leader of this island ... Thank you so much ! I 'm sure my predecessor would be pleased . And once the wedding is over , you 'll be able to expand your operations to the neighboring countries — What ? ! Logan is here ? ! It 's not gonna be easy getting into the Dragon Palace . The roads in Hightown are hard to make sense of for an outsider , and everyone knows you 're coming . Sounds like good odds to me . But it 's not like all of them are crooks because they want to be ... Kurohagi 's thugs ... If they do as he says , they can survive . Nobody can stand up to him . Ruling through fear , eh ? Maybe we are all crooks ... But , a lot of us hate that very fact ! I can 't trust the people of the city to handle this . It 's finally time to set you loose . Your target is Wolverine ! You can 't do it by yourself ! You won 't make it to the Dragon Palace ! No matter how tough you are ! I appreciate the concern . I 'm just telling you the truth ! You don 't know this island ! That 's why — I don 't know this , I can 't do that ... mind your own business ! I 'm gonna go there ! Go there , and get Mariko — Mariko ? Seeya . Wolverine ! You may not pass ! Damned ox ! I can 't just leave you ! Aren 't you after Mariko ? Go and find Shingen ! I guess this is about more than hating Kurohagi ... We would appreciate it if the famous Wolverine would lend us his strength . Next time on Wolverine ... Vadhaka .

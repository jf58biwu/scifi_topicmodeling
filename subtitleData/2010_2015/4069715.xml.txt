Can 't you be yourself here ? Can you ? one lost soul Can recognize another I thought you were Just after the sword . I 'm looking For a lot of things . What do You want from me ? I need your help . Why ? Because my last Name is Kusanagi ? because you Are the last Kusanagi . I 'm not who You want me to be . and And Rugal destroyed all that . The Kusanagi Clan is over . I don 't know that your father Would agree with that . He gave you the name . What makes you think That I can succeed Where Saisyu failed ? I 'm not a hero . I don 't Know what you are . You don 't even Know what you are . And we 're going to do It with or without you . You did what ? I don 't know what 's Going on with these things I had to do something .

We 've No time to lose . And I 'm afraid your plan to Stop him won 't work . right ? it 's Because Rugal is close To merging our two worlds . What do you mean ? It 's kind of cool here we go again . you see These dimensions see ? I told you There was more than one . These dimensions Exist in what could more Accurately be described As a multi verse Or parallel universe . Rugal was Able to get access to An exact replica of Our plane of existence .

Then why don 't You stop all of this and Come back to The real world ? This world is all I need . I 'm immortal . This isn 't life . This is where we come to Challenge ourselves so we can be better In the real world . When my world expands And merges with this will Be the real world . I 'll be King of everything .

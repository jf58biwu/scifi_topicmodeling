 Previously on Fringe ... When we were in Jacksonville , there was a height chart with names . Yeah , all the kids from Walter and Bell 's Cortexiphan trials . I made a list . Nick Lane and James Heath . They were both part of Walter 's tests . Of all the children that Walter and I prepared , You were the strongest . A storm is coming , and when it is over , I fear there will be little left of our world . I 'm not from here , am I ? You didn 't just open up a hole to the other side . You brought me back . That 's why I can 't remember my childhood . You were dying . That 's why my mother committed suicide . She knew . Walter , Peter checked himself out of the hospital three hours ago . He 's gone . Mr. Secretary . Hello , son . [ alarm blaring ] ( Man ) Anomalous energy signature detected . Local ... Brooklyn . Confirmed ... We 've got a breach . ( Man ) Knock it down . ( Charlie ) Oh , I was thinking , " Hey , " " may be a slow day , it being Saturday and all . " No rest for the wicked . Oh , you 're not wicked , Charlie . You just pretend really , really well . Somebody playing my song ? ( Man # 1 ) Class one event , sir . - I can see that . You ? Yes , I can . Clear as day . ( Colonel Broyles ) Okay , people , nap time 's over . Let 's go to work . So exactly how big would the worms get if you stopped dosing yourself ? They 're not worms . ( All ) They 're arachnids . ( Lincoln Lee ) Sit rep as follows : Class-one molecular dissolution . Numbers show severe molecular cohesion failure . This isn 't just a little tear . No data yet . On site in less than 60 seconds . Long as it 's not bugs . Oh , it 's probably bugs . What ? Bugs like you . ( Charlie ) On my six ! [ sirens wailing ] [ over loudspeaker ] I want science and risk reports in three minutes . Site 's secure , boss . [ scanner signal warbling ] [ black light buzzing ] [ com beeps ] Chief , this is bad . I 'm showing stage-three degradation . I need data that tells me this event is contained , Captian . ( Lincoln Lee ) I 'm trying here . [ scanner signal warbling ] Damn it . We 're in potential quarantine range here , sir . Send up a looker , stat . ( Man # 1 ) The looker 's being dispatched now , sir . Hi . I 'm Agent Dunham with Fringe Division . - Could I see your show-me , please ? - Sure . You ain 't gonna quarantine the place , right ? There 's nothing to worry about . But if you could tell me what you saw ... I mean , even small things could be important . I 'm getting decreased gravity measurements here , Colonel . Activating quarantine potentiator . Agent Farnsworth ? Broyles . Phillip . Colonel . Risk assessment . I need to know if this thing is spreading . We can 't have another Boston , Captain . ( Lincoln Lee ) I know that . You think I don 't know that ? ( mechanical voice ) Quarantine device unlocked . [ alarm blares ] Recommendation , Agent . ( Alternate Astrid ) Quarantine will result in excess of 10,000 casualties . ( mechanical voice ) Warning . One minute to quarantine . Massive loss of life will result . Warning ... Recommendation , Agent . Gravitational and molecular degeneration are decreasing , but outside acceptable parameters . - Recommendation , Agent Farnsworth ? - Calculating . ( mechanical voice ) Massive loss of life will result . - Really ? - 40 seconds to quarantine . Quarantine device unlocked . God , and I didn 't even update my will . - Massive loss of life will result . - Frank would just spent it all anyway . Warning : 30 seconds to quarantine . Recommendation , Agent Farnsworth ? Event is terminating ... No quarantine recommended . Captain , you are clear . Do not quarantine . Repeat ... Do not quarantine . ( mechanical voice ) 20 seconds to quarantine . - We got to stop doing this . - Warning ... [ alarm and mechanical voice stop ] ( Charlie ) Hey , guys . We got something up here . I wish it was bugs . ( Bolivia ) What is that ? ( Lincoln Lee ) These look like carcinomas . But there 's no way anyone could live long enough to develop tumors this severe . Witnesses have anything ? The usual ... I mean , they heard a tearing sound , they saw a blue flash through the window . I gave them chips so they could get radiation scans . I 'll see if he has any I.D. Guy may have had a wife and kids before the universe sucked him up and spat him out . Poor guy . That 's not a show-me . Okay . Check this out . Who the hell is Jackson ? ( Walter ) Olivia . Come on . Come on . Let 's go . Come on , everyone . Keep down . Come on . Come on . ( Walternate ) I can take you back where you belong , son . They have our coordinates . But if you come with me , you won 't be able to come back here . You have to make a choice , Peter . ( Peter ) Let 's go . [ static ] Thanks . [ phone dialing ] [ cell phone rings ] - Hello ? - Hello , Agent Dunham . There ... there is something I am supposed to remember , And I can 't remember what it is , but it 's about Peter . - Walter ... - No , no , no ! I think something is going to happen to him , Something ... Something terrible . I think this is what I 'm supposed to remember . Okay . Well , one of those men ... you know , the Observers ... I think he left it for me . Well , after I brought Peter from the other side , some years later , one of them came to visit me . Well ... well , he told me that I had to agree to never let Peter return to the other side . Why ? Because if I did , this would happen . Okay , but what is this , Walter ? What does it even mean ? Look , look , it is exactly what it appears to be . See ? I think my son ... is going to be responsible for the end of the world . Okay , Walter , we have get Peter back . He went over by his own free will ... But he didn 't know about this . - Even if he wanted to come back now ... - Walter , how do we get him back ? we have no way of contacting ... [ pounds on table ] Walter ! How ? ( Man ) I 'm sorry , sir , I can 't let you go in there , - this is ... - Don 't even think about it ! - What is this , Phillip ? - We have reason to believe your company is manufacturing weapons for the other side . - Oh , that 's absurd . - I want every piece of data even remotely related to the other universe . How dare you ? Are you out of your mind ? Stop it , both of you ! Peter is in danger . Walter says that this technology has a very specific and recognizable design . I daresay Nina would agree . Dear God . What side is this ? Does it matter ? This is William 's technology , but we didn 't build it . Okay , Nina , listen to me . Peter 's been taken . You have to help us cross over . ( Brandon ) The thing is , get over there , that 's uh , really a misnomer . In truth , the two universes are overlapping . And to get to the other side , our universe needs to pass through you , literally , Like ... like water passing through a cheesecloth . Our cells need to separate on an atomic level . The problem is , when they come back together , they don 't come back together with the same cohesion . Somehow , Bell managed to cross back and forth , although precisely how , we can find no record of . But I suspect that whatever methodology , he crossed so many times that he 's become like this coffee cup ... molecularly unstable . As many atoms in each of us as there are stars in the sky . It 's why Belly never came back , isn 't it ? Because he was scared that the same thing would happen to him . I don 't know . I 've sent him communications , but if he got them , he hasn 't been able to communicate to me . ( Olivia ) There has to be a way . What about how you crossed over when you first got Peter ? The last time I opened a door , it set in motion the ripples that weaken the very fabric of our reality . To do so again could instantly shatter both worlds ... and likely would . Brandon , give us a moment . You know , unlike William , you have the ability to cross over safely . I can 't . I ... I ... I mean , I ... I ... I can 't control it . I 've ... I 've flashed over for a few seconds , or Bell 's pulled me over , but I ... I ... I can 't control it , not on my own . Not on your own , but if there were two or three of you , A ... a ... a larger power supply , as it were . I 'm not following . With more Cortexiphan children , their collective psychic energy could ... You know , Belly and I always agreed that that primal part of the brain which allows us to cross universes is also responsible for a host of ... of paranormal activities ... pyrokinesis , telepathy , thought control . And that we all had these abilities Until ... till there was a moment in history when something was done to us , and ... and it was shut down . I suspect aliens . Unfortunately , the only other Cortexiphan children that we have located , they have failed or worse . You ... are the only one left . Actually ... she 's not . There 's still over a dozen Cortexiphan subjects unaccounted for . Prudence dictated we determine what we might be dealing with in the future . So you woke all three of them up ? Actually , five . We tracked down some others . Okay . About six weeks ago , Massive Dynamic proposed a series of experiments to help them gain control of and repurpose their abilities . These three have been quite successful . James Heath can now cure disease , not cause it . Sally Clark is becoming a fully functional pyrokinetic . And your friend Nick Lane 's empathic transfers can now be controlled . Olive . [ laughter ] Nick . [ laughter fades ] Very good , baby . Welcome to the monkey house . [ elevator bell dings ] This is new . Who authorized it ? Senate intelligence ... thanks to Peter . It was part of a list of demands he gave me right before I went to secure our funding . This is very Mission : Impossible . [ Sally chuckles ] I know you . You 're the man that experimented on us . I could kill you where you stand . Each of you could . What I did ... was inexcusable ... barbaric . The collateral damage has been extensive . But know that we had noble goals . We believed that our world needed guardians , protectors , that you children would be those protectors . We fostered your talents because we foresaw that the day would come when both universes would be in jeopardy . So ... horrible as it is to say , today is the day for which you were created . What I could never have imagined is that I would be asking you to help me save my son . I 'm so sorry . Well , if none of you are gonna kill me ... I think I 'll go and have a bit of a cry . Man , that 's not the same guy I remember . He 's exactly the same . Dr. Bishop has identified a likely spot to attempt a crossover ... Brooklyn , New York . You go at 0800 tomorrow morning . You might want to get some rest . ( James ) Hey , FBI guy . We 're about to go save the world , right ? Two worlds even . [ chuckles ] Can 't we have a night off ? Whatever they want . [ monitor beeping ] Who are you ? I was never lucky , you know ? Sometimes people need some good luck . Tonight I guess that 's me . Who else do we have ? ♪ ♪ Sweet . Hmm . Me or the strawberry ? Both . So what would you like this time ... to feel what I 'm feeling or what you 're feeling ? Both . Please , God ... Aunt Liv , what time is it ? It 's early . [ chuckles ] I have to go on a trip , and , uh ... I wanted to give you something before left . It 's pretty . My mother ... your grandmother ... gave it to me before she died . She told me that it would keep me safe . So now I 'm giving it to you . Thanks , Aunt Liv . You are welcome , baby girl . You 're up early . I didn 't even hear you come in last night . No , I 've been working a case . Think you 'll be home for dinner ? I hope so . I 'll call you and let you know . Okay . Hey , you okay ? Yeah . We should do this more often . It 's nice . Sure . [ door opens , closes ] Look what Aunt Liv gave me . ( Broyles ) Even assuming this works ... that you make it to the other side , you still have no idea how you 're going to locate Peter . ( Olivia ) No , but I spoke to Nina Sharp , and she sent a message to William Bell asking him to meet us at the Grayshot Bridge in Central Park at 4 : 00 P.M. I think he 'll help us find Peter . Dunham ... Massive Dynamic didn 't make that weapon over here . That means Bell may have made it on the other side for them . No . I trust him . In any case , Nina has no confirmation - that Bell even gets her messages . - No . In which case , you 're essentially invading enemy territory without a plan . You don 't know anything about the opposition , the landscape ... [ door opens ] [ breathing heavily ] Oh , we 're ready . We 're ready to try this . ( Broyles ) You can 't tell me you think this is a good idea . No . I don 't think that this is a good idea . But you got a better one ? ( Walter ) It was lovely , wasn 't it ? Now ... faded and broken just like me . So how does this work , Walter ? Remember your Shakespeare , dear . " All the world is a stage . " Or in this case , both worlds . You will form a circle . I ... I will stand in the middle , and I will lead you across . No . You can 't do this . Oh , no . No . He is my son , Olivia . You can 't do this . I won 't allow it . I believe I can . Or ... or else they cannot . I can 't ask them to do something that I ... I 'm not willing to chance myself . Thank you . Well , if any of you have changed your minds , I will understand . We were talking about it on the way over here . Maybe you did damage us . But on the other hand , maybe you made us special . Fate is a tricky thing . So , um ... [ clears throat ] You ... you would want to take a few steps back , I think , Agent Broyles . Olivia . Now , I want you to clear your minds and ... and just relax . All right ? Now , ignore everything except the sound of my voice . Now ... Sp ... spread out your arms . You remember how . Spread them out to each other . Yes . Good . Now , I want you to think back to when you were just young children , Back to when you were just young boys and girls . Think back to when your imagination could ... could take you wherever you wanted to go . Imagine this universe slipping away , opening like a curtain . Allow the universe to pass right through you . Allow your imagination to take you to the other side . [ groans ] ( Olivia ) James . James . ( James ) [ gasps ] Help me . Walter , what do we do ? Look ... We made it . We 're on the other side . [ siren wails ] Okay , come on , James . You 've got to get up . We 've got to hide now . Nick ... Nick , I don 't feel so good . Through here . Come on . [ over loudspeaker ] I want science and risk reports in three minutes . [ whispering ] Nick . Nick , make them leave . [ whispering ] I 've been trying . It 's not working . What 's wrong with us ? - I don 't know . - Nick , I 'm scared . Check this out . Who the hell is Jackson ? Got a junior ? Yeah . Going to a strip club later ? Someone 's got to visit your sister . [ chuckles ] The paper 's real . The detail is amazing . Why would someone go to this kind of trouble ? [ computer beeping ] ( Colonel Broyles ) What in God 's name did you all find ? Nothing useful . Dead end so far . Well , whatever it is you scanned just raised a red flag over at the D.O.D. The secretary wants to see you . ( Bolivia ) Hey , Charlie , you ever met him ? I shook his hand once when I graduated the academy . What about you ? My dad knew him . Oh , that explains so much . Yeah , you don 't want to leak worms all over the guy . Makes a bad first impression . They 're not worms . He 's waiting for you . Go ahead in . Mr. Secretary . Thank you . Agent Lee ... I 'm sorry about your father . He was a good man . Fine jurist . Thank you , sir . - And this is your team ? - Yes , sir . - Agents Francis and Dunham . - Sir . I understand you 're investigating a Fringe event in Brooklyn . - That 's correct , sir . - And in this event , there was a casualty ... a man ? That 's correct , sir . So far , we haven 't been able to ... Agent , I believe that I may have insight into who that man is and where he was from . What I 'm about to tell you is classified . But I think it 's time you knew what you 're dealing with . Agent Dunham , what can you tell me about the Fringe Division ? Okay , I 'll play . Uh ... The Fringe Division is a special adjunct branch of the Department of Defense . Its primary focus are natural and environmental disasters that began in 1985 with the Zero Event at Reiden Lake . And what are these natural disasters ? They 're holes in the fabric of the universe , sir . A-plus . [ chuckles ] And how do you know all this ? I know it because I read it in the ZFT in 1995 when you wrote and published it . ( Walternate ) The ZFT . The natural decay of our world . What would you say if I told you that the ZFT is a lie or a half-truth anyway ? These tears are not natural . They are the work of man . These holes don 't simply lead to nothing . There is something on the other side . What ? - Another one . - Bravo . - Another what ? - Another universe ... a parallel Earth just like this , but slightly different . And it was their attempt to penetrate our world which created the pattern of destruction that we struggle with daily . The $ 20 bill was ... From the other side , and so was he . And I suspect he didn 't come alone . As you know , I am not a lover of war . But I have reason to believe that these invaders are anything but peaceful . They must be found , and they must be found quickly . We 'll get them , sir . I 'm burning up , Nick . It 'll be fine , baby . [ bus approaching ] Come on . Scan your I.D. , lady . Sorry . Uh , we 're gonna have to walk . Central Park is 59th Street ... that 's three miles from here . Okay , then we better get started . [ monitor warbling , beeping ] [ monitor beeps twice ] [ monitor beeps once ] Hi . Hi . How are you feeling ? I 'm okay . You 've been asleep for three days . Your fa ... Walter said you might feel a bit dizzy . Maybe you 'd like to sit down . I 'm okay . You must be starving . I made some eggs and bacon . Do ... do you still like bacon ? When you were a boy , we ... I love bacon . Oh , Peter . Oh , I 've missed you so much . [ sobbing ] - Oh . - Stop for a second . It 's fine . I 'm fine . Let 's go . You 've got to know something . What the hell is wrong with us ? Oh , I suspect that somehow the human circuit was flawed . Did any of you engage in extreme use of your abilities Last night ? Far more than normal ? No . Perhaps poor Mr. Heath ... - You 've got to help her . - I can 't . But if we 're lucky , perhaps William Bell can . It 's the Grand Hotel . They never built it . Things that might have been in our world , but weren 't . Come on . - It 's not far . - Okay . ( Elizabeth ) Coffee 's quite hard to come by over here . It 's been rationed for some time now . But Walter 's very well connected . It 's funny , I ... I never had bacon when I was growing up . My mother was vegetarian , so she never made it . Until today , I always thought I imagined having it as a kid . I 'm sorry ... my mother from the other side . I 'm sure you don 't want to hear about that . No , on the contrary . I want to hear all about your childhood . What 's ... Are you close with her still ? I mean ... did she take good care of you ? She took very good care of me . But she committed suicide about ten years ago . My mother from the other side ... she was wonderful , but she wasn 't strong . In fact , she was very , very sad ... which I suppose is because of me . No , listen . Peter , in the end , we have to take responsibility for our own decisions ... the good and the bad . Your father 's going to be so pleased to see you . He had said he wanted me to help him with something . Yes , he 's staying in the city tonight . But he asked me to give you this . Oh , God . Look , Nick . These were my favorite . Can I get one ? ( Nick ) I don 't think so , baby . We got to go . I ... I like it here . Maybe ... maybe we can stay . [ breathing heavily ] Nick ... I 'm gonna stay . I know , baby . I know . Come on , let 's go . ( Nick ) Do you see him ... William Bell ? No . There 's a water fountain . Come on , I think it 'll help . Are we late ? Maybe he didn 't get the message . [ sirens wailing ] No . Belly 's betrayed us . Run , run , run ! [ sirens wailing ] Oh ! ( Lincoln Lee ) Don 't move ! [ gunshot ] [ groans ] Walter . Walter ! [ gunfire ] Nick ? I think I 'm staying here . You stay . We 'll stay together . Look , I don 't want to hurt you . Step away . Screw you . Hey ! [ com beeps ] ( Man ) Man down . Med team to Grayshot Bridge . Man down . Lincoln ? Liv . Hey . Where 's the ambulance ? [ sirens in distance ] Dizzy ... Must be the onset of hemorrhagic shock . [ gasps ] [ wincing ] But I 'm still walking , so the bullet couldn 't have hit my spinal column . I 'll be perfectly fine . Excuse me . Do you really understand all these ? Maybe . I 'm not sure yet . Good night , Peter . Good night . [ siren wailing ] [ screen beeping ] Hey . [ chuckles ] Oh . Mm . I tried to wait up . Oh , hi , baby . How is he ? Well , he 's got third-degree burns over 90 % of his body . He 's gonna need three months in a nanite regeneration chamber , but he 'll live . I 'm sorry ... and on your last night . - I 'm going for a week , not until the end of time . - Yeah . Details . Might be a good day to start drinking . Oh , God . I would if I could only stand the taste . So what happened out there ? Just a ... a small anomaly that set off a fuel cell . It was just bad luck of the draw is all . Come on , no more work . I know what you need . [ chuckles ] Yeah ? What 's that ? Back rub . Oh , you are a god . - I 'll get the oil . - Really ? On your last night ? Oh . I 'll take it . Mm . Mm . Hello , Olivia . It 's good to see you again . - How ... how did you know that I ... - I suspected you would come here . Okay , so where were you at the park ? I received Nina 's message , but when I got to the park , it was too late . There was nothing I could do . My dear Olivia , I know you have good reason not to trust me . But I 'm afraid you 're going to have to . Walter is in trouble . And I 'm quite confident we don 't have much time .

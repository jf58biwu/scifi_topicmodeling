 Okay , Audrey . Ready for calibration . You got it , Doc . Commencing calibration . You keep calling me " Doc , " I 'm gonna have to find a new research assistant . How long have you been threatening that ? Yeah , but this time , I mean it . Fine . Dr. Cooper , then . I know how much you love your title . Tracking . One-two-one-five . One-two-one-five ? Check . " 1215 . " Magna Carta . Come on , Doc ! It 's a document , where King John proclaimed liberties to the people . It 's a furbearer to our constitution . Yeah , I know what the Magna Carta is , but since it has nothing to do with dioxide sensors or anything we 're doing here , for that matter , guess what , you 're fired . Anything ? It 's a thing of beauty . Depth , pressure ... composition . All in a day 's work . Wait-wait-wait . Are you getting anything on the surface ? No . Why ? Our seismic sensors are showing some activity . You 're right on top of it . Matthew ' ? I 'm seeing a major subsurface C02 spike . Yeah . Me too . Trans Nova Oil 's new laser drill makes it possible to penetrate deeper than ever before , opening vast reserves previously unattainable . The Paxton Well promises oil deposits larger than those of Saudi Arabia . The site itself is housed in the safest , cleanest environment ever conceived . There 's no derrick . The entire operation is underground , eliminating any surface disturbance . In fact , the well itself is powered by its own hydro-electricity . Not good enough , folks . Nobody cares about drill technology or an operations room that 's 200 feet underground . Well , I 'm sure our stockholders do . Exactly my point ! We 're not selling our stockholders on the benefit of this well , Jennifer . We 're selling our critics ... the petitioners , protesters , the ones who don 't want us here . We will never pacify those people . All we 've done is embolden them by conceding to every concession , and what 's that gotten us ? Another injunction . We located our office , here , locally , in Paxton , to show them that we 're not just a corporate logo . We 're a neighbor . Which means we have to be good neighbors . We need to earn it . The drill site is located on a National Preserve , which is already one strike against us . Jobs and the environment ... this community cares about both , so we have to deliver both . We need to communicate that . A new era ... different kind of company . I almost think you mean that . We have to mean it . Look , we can build all the parks we want fund music programs , but these people will never welcome us as neighbors Oliver . Our focus should be Congress and getting the injunction lifted . It 's been seven months since the infrastructure was completed We 're bleeding . Which is just what I 'm talking about . All we need ... is Senator Bryce , and Bryce is up for re-election , is he not ? He listens to the voters , the people who live and breathe in this community . We convince them . That 's how we get the injunction lifted . Have you heard back from Senator Bryce ? I 'm emailing him again right now , but ... how do you spell " recalcitrant ? " I don 't even know what it means . It 's basically having a bad attitude towards authority . Well , that 's not a very helpful thing to say to a Senator , Emily . I 'm not . I 'm saying it about myself . You know , a little self-deprecation can go a long way . Oh , well , I 'll remember that . He can 't ignore me forever . He will . Thank you . Thank you , Mayor Bennett and members of the Council , but most of all , thanks to all of you , the good people of Paxton . Yeah ! I came here personally so that I could get to know your community and meet you face-to-face . And I came here with one agenda ... Let 's get you back to work ! And I 'm very happy to contribute to your community . This new park is a reminder that we are partners . I know that we 've had our ups and downs , but it 's your support that has made it possible for us to fulfill our promise . So call your Senators , call your representatives , and let them know that , together , we are helping to make this country independent of foreign oil . Let 's keep working together , let 's go forward together . Enjoy your park ! Thank you ! Thanks , Mayor . Did you know he was coming to Paxton himself ? People will see right through the manipulation . It 's obvious . He sells the product , Emily . And you say he 's a con artist , but I 'm not so sure other people are gonna see it , and I 'm not so sure anymore that this video is worth our time . Well , we need to show Congress that there isn 't support here . They need to see Trans Nova is trying to buy their way out of the injunction . The whole thing is a con ! Except you can 't make the argument that they haven 't done their part . We 'll lose credibility . Done their part ? Seriously ? By , what ? Drilling on what used to be protected land ? Putting us and the environment at risk ? Okay . Calm down . Obviously , they 've cast their spell on you , too . Who are you talking to , Em ? I 've been leading this fight since the very beginning . I hate those bastards . But guess what ? For the first time , an oil company 's actually listened to us . We 've made a difference . And what if it is as clean as it promises to be ? Every green initiative that we care about is gonna take a backseat . People will be more than happy in their gas-guzzlers , paying a buck-fifty a gallon . So you 'd prefer a catastrophe to prove your point ' ? As long as they 're drilling , it already is a catastrophe . So what did CalTech say ? They agree with USGS . They said the Crystal Lake event is a one-time anomaly , the water samples are back to normal , and there 's no additional venting . All right , well , what caused it , then ? Minor tremor under the lake breached a pocket of gas . That tremor wasn 't strong enough to release that much C02 that quickly . All that gas had to have already been trapped at water level by another stronger event . There 's something else going on here . But there 's no record of any other seismic activity . U-Unless it happened prior to their last report ? Of course . It 's getting worse , isn 't it ? Why don 't you go check with CalTech ? Dr. Cooper ? Hey , Dr. Cooper ! Hey . I 'm Emily Booth . We met briefly at the first Senate hearing . Yeah , I know who you are . I ... I 'm sorry , okay ? I know I was rude . I-I just want to ask you a few questions about what happened at Crystal Lake . The dead fish ? We know of other cases where underground drilling released toxic gasses to the surface . The drill 's been shut down for five months , so . Right , but they were drilling for two months before we shut them down Well , you know Mother Earth is a living , breathing creature . Sometimes underground gasses vent . I mean , that kind of volume is a little extreme , but it does happen . Bad day for the fish . No , it 's not just " a bad day for the fish . " Could those gasses have been released anywhere else ? Well , as of right now , they haven 't . " As of right now " ? I 'm sorry , Dr. Cooper , but I 'm just a little bit concerned here . I mean , we have a responsibility to the people in this community . Look , there 's no indication that this was anything else but a one-time event . I 'm sorry if that 's inconvenient for you . You think that this has nothing to do with the drilling ? No . Like you would admit that anyway , right ? I 'm sorry , what ' ? How can someone in your profession work for them ? You should be on our side , Dr. Cooper . Oh ! I see . So you think there 's ... there 's , what , only two sides ? Really ? You think that you 're the only one interested in making sure they toe the line up there ? Let me tell you something . My family has been here for four generations . This is my backyard , too . Oliver . How soon ? Thank you , Tom . We got the votes . We 're back up and running . That 's great . Hey ! Come here , you . I 'll be right in , okay ? So what time will you pick him up ? Nice try . I 'll wait in the car . Seriously , Todd ? How long do we have to do this ? You 're a convicted felon . I was arrested for protesting . For destruction of government property , wasn 't it ? That has nothing to do with this . Right , well . This wasn 't your only arrest , Emily . The courts ruled . Gotta live with it . Hi . God , I missed you . So ... what do you want to do ? Should we , should we play a board game ? You can pick . Do you have any video games ? No , I don 't have any video games . How are things at your dad 's ? Like always . You know , it 's not my choice that I can 't see you that often , Dylan . But it was your choice to go to jail . Remember when you got detention ? You got in trouble because you were sticking up for another kid who was being bullied , right ' ? Well , detention was kind of like jail . That 's what happened to me . Our planet ... our environment is bullied every single day , and I was just sticking up for it . That kind of make sense ? Yeah , I guess . Hey , so , I have stuff to make peanut butter-and-potato chip sandwiches . Your favorite . I 'll go make you one . Yeah ? You watching this ? No , what ? They lifted the injunction . They 're going to resume drilling . He 's got them in his hand as well . I swear to God , I 'll blow up that well myself . Okay , don 't say that , Em . People 'll think you 're serious . Look , we have other tactics . This is not over . Okay ? I 'll be right there , sweetie , okay ? Listen , I 'll call you right back , okay ? Hey . You heard ? Well , we need to block their access now . No ! Okay Dylan ? I 'll call you back . Ready to go ? Dylan ! Dylan ! Wait ! What 's up , Hank the Tank ? Eric . Remember ? High school ? I remember you ... " Hank the Tank . " Hank the Tank ! I bet you that still gets under your skin , doesn 't it ? Okay , time for you to move back . Look at you now ! All dressed up in your uniform . Protecting what ? Land that 's already supposed to be protected . Does that mean anything to you ? Means something to us , man ! To you , it 's just a job . Is that your excuse ? Yeah . Yeah , that 's my excuse . Guys like me , we actually have to have to work for a living to pay our bills . You should try it sometime . That 's good , man . Thing is , when I wake up in the morning , it 's not the food on my table that I worry about . It 's the clean food and water on everyone 's table ! You should try that , Hank the Tank . Why don 't you try stepping back with your little friends ? They lifted the injunction ! These bastards are gonna start drilling again ! Well ... not here , not now ! Not here , not now ! Not here , not now ! Morning , Ana . Hey ! I made eggs . Your first full day back in a while , so you 'll need a ... you 'll need a good breakfast . Thanks . Talk to Mr. Larson yet ' ? He 's going to get back to me . Really ? You know , when I spoke with him , he said that , they 're short a couple nurses , and he really wants you back . Ana , stop . It was today . I know . I know it was today . Of course , I know that . Just ... come on . Don 't . Don 't set the plate . I just need to . Okay ? Okay I don 't have to go in , you know . I could call them . I think it 's great you 're going back to work today , Hector . - They 'll understand . - Take your mind off things . Today is a good day for you to go back to work . I 'll be fine . I will . I know that you think this has been too long . I just ... have to do it my way , you know ? It 's not too long . Listen , it 's never gonna be too long . I just thought that if you went back to work , It 'd be a good thing . You 'll get a chance to put your mind on other things , too . Yeah , but I don 't want my mind on other things . And I know you don 't understand that , Hector . I do , though . Ana , I understand . Welcome back , Hector . How 's she doing , Glen ? Valves are open . Smooth so far . Have we pushed past that granite yet ? Yeah . So far , It 's moving through that substrata faster than we thought . Good . How 's the heat ? Below levels . Beautiful . We keep this pace up , we could end up with a fat bonus in our pockets . Bonus ? Yeah . I spoke with Mr. Booth this morning . He 's really happy with the programs over here . Yeah . This is the easy part , Hector . We got a ways to go before we reach the target . We 'll get there . You felt that , obviously ? - What was that ' ? - I don 't know . Heat , pressure , viscosity , it 's all reading normal . Let 's just check the condenser valve here . It 's a little low , but we 're still in the green . Could be a lateral plate . The gauge would 've picked that up . Unless ... No , no , if it says it 's normal , it 's normal . Hector ... You and I both know once we reach past ... Shut up ! You and I both signed our name in the same place , right ? - Right ? - Yeah . Okay But I 'm starting to feel like I 'm getting second thoughts . Glen ... Stop ! I think people should know what we 're doing up here . We 've all been out of work a couple of years here , all right ? We need this now . Don 't go doing anything stupid . You got it ? - Got it . - Got it . Let 's get back on it . The location of the aneurism won 't allow for endovascular coiling , Which would 've been less invasive . Sorry . That leaves surgical clipping as our only option , Otherwise the pressure in the aneurism is gonna continue to build until it bursts It 's a procedure that allows us to essentially channel the blood around the other blood vessels . Will it work ' ? Well , there 's risk ... particularly where it 's positioned , and there could be side-effects . But you 've got a ticking time bomb in there , Matthew . I want to schedule this for no later than Wednesday . Jesus , Dave , how ... How risky ? We got plans on Thursday . It could take a year before it bursts , or it could be a week . But it will burst . This is your best option I 'm sorry , I have to take this . Hello ? This is Matthew . How many ? Yeah . I can be there in an hour . Look , tell them to stay away from there , okay ? Alright . Thanks . Bye . Sorry . I have to go . It 's an emergency . I 'll call you from the road . Thanks . All right . Have a good night , Jim . Hector ! Yeah . Haven 't seen you in awhile . How 's it going up there at the well ? Pretty good so far , I guess . Well , that 's good . It 's nice to see you guys up and running again . Maybe people will come around and start spending some money . - There you go . Cheers . - Cheers . Want another ? Yeah . Why not ? What 's eating you , man ? Dev . Five years ago today . Just let him drink . - Cheers , bro . - On me . Hey , Chris . Hey , buddy , thanks . How 's Glen working out ? He holding his own ? Yeah . Pretty good . He knows what he 's doing . Well , if he starts slacking off , let me know and I 'll straighten him out . Yeah , I 'll do that . Hector ... I didn 't mean to surprise you like this . I just got out last week . I 've tried calling you a few times . Nobody wants you in here , man . I 'm talking to my brother , Chris . Is he talking to you ? Go back out the way you came in . Every day , man . Every day , Hector , every day , I live with it . Yeah ? Me too . Ana ' ? I saw Samuel . He 's out , and he 's back in town here . I don 't want to hear his name mentioned again in this house . Ana ... He 's my brother . Well , he 's not my family . Not anymore . Excuse me , sir . Learn the truth about Trans Nova . Thank you . Have a good day . Excuse me . No ? Learn the truth about Trans Nova Oil . Thank you . I 'll take one . Hi . Can we talk ? Emily , it 's been ' lo years . Even just a " hello " would be a good start . What are you even doing here ? Why are you in Paxton ? For you , ironically . The injunction , the protests ... I 'm the head of the company . I have to be here . But I knew that you would be here , and I wanted to come . And Dylan . I haven 't even met my own grandson . It wasn 't me that hasn 't returned the phone calls . It 's not me that doesn 't want to talk to you . I see you 're still angry at me , but it 's been years , Emily . Yes , you 're right , Dad , I am still angry . You can read all about it . Yeah , we 're on a conference call tomorrow with Representative Hennessey . What , how do I know he 's gonna come to the protest ? Because I promised him a case of beer Look , let me call you back . Okay ? Okay . Bye . That was Lisa . She 's got dozens committed to the sit-in over at Indian Creek . Yeah ? So why can 't she get a couple of dozen people at the Paxton Well ' ? Sorry . Well , the fire 's sort of burning itself out on that one . Yeah , because we 're letting it . Okay , well , what else can we do ? We can come up with something else . This can 't be perceived as a personal vendetta against your father , Em . You think that 's what this is about ? Seriously ? Everything that I have worked for ' ? - Everything that I 've sacrificed ? - Of course not . You 're just as passionate about this as anyone else here , but there is not so much as a coffee stain up there . Look , we know their past violations , and how many times have they just walked away from their messes before ? This is ... This is not going to be any different . And that 's his pattern , isn 't it ? Walk away ? Leave a mess ? Don 't they all ? Em . Screw you . What time ? Hey . Can I talk to Dylan ? I just wanted to say hello . Well , I 'm allowed to talk to him on the phone , Todd . Okay , I 'm sorry . Look , will you please just have him call me ? Yeah , I really feel bad about what happened . It won 't happen again . Em . Jerry just heard on his police scanner something about a bunch of dead cows out on a farm near Maple Grove . Maybe you just got what you 're looking for . I 'll go and check it out . Matthew , thanks for coming . No problem . What 've we got ? Dead livestock . We think it might be some kind of gas , but I don 't know , I 've never seen anything like this . They were alive not more than 15 minutes before I found them like this . Do me a favor . Keep your family away from here , would you ? Ricky ! Back in the house . Hey , Dean , stand up . Stand up . C02 hovers in low pockets , like bubbles , it 'll kill you in seconds . Dad ? Dad ! Dad , the dog ! It 's gas ! Get up ! Hey , hey , hey , hey ! Don 't do that ! - Stand up ! ' Ricky ! Stop ! Get him out of here ! No , no , no . What 's that for ? Just stand back . C02 's heavier than air . This smoke should help us see where the gas pockets are . How long do we have to stay away ? I don 't know . Until we find out where it 's coming from , it 's just too dangerous . This is an unusual thing to happen , though , right ? Hasn 't been lately . Look , I 'm going to request a geothermal reading , see if we can 't pinpoint where this thing vented . The gas seems to be dissipating a little bit already . - I 'll try to come back tomorrow . - Sounds good . Dr. Cooper ! Do you have any idea what killed these cows ? Think it has something to do with the dead fish ? Ma 'am , you 'll have to leave . This is private property . - It was gas , wasn 't it ? - Right ? Do you know where it 's coming from ? We don 't know . Soil and water samples won 't come back for a couple more days ... but there was no contamination last time . What do you mean , last time ? In closer to Maple Grove . People have been getting sick , but the samples all come back clean . Something ain 't right around here , but it beats the hell out of me . - Ma 'am . - Yeah . So , how many cases ? Two were transported in serious condition . Others seemed to move through it rather quickly . And you don 't think that it could be salmonella or e-coll ? Children , and the elderly in particular , are still getting sick , but only here . It hasn 't affected anyone else outside this area . What about the CDC ? It 's not contagious . Whether it 's in the air or the ground , I don 't know . But I also don 't know what else to do . Well , I was told your office was responsible for the testing . Our department was responding to a State request . We collected samples , yes . Well , what about the actual testing ? Let me see . In this case , it was contracted out to a private lab . Why is that ? Well , quite often , we have to . We don 't have the resources to handle every case . Okay , well , does the State Regulatory Services monitor the testing ? Well , they adhere to all regulations , of course . What 's the name of the lab ? Hold on . Company called GenCo , based out of Atlanta . Okay . Well , thank you . Sure . I just can 't tomorrow . No , I understand , but I have things I have to get off my plate here . No , no new symptoms . Do you understand that we 've had two major vents in the last 48 hours ? Yeah . Monday could work . Sure . Thank you . Suggests an unusual seismic pressure release ? I understand . No activity , no stress . Got it . Alright . Thanks , Doc . Bye . Okay . Thank you very much . So , we need approval from USGS for a satellite thermal reading , which could take two or three days . What 's Monday ? Just a follow-up . What 'd the doctor say ' ? That I shouldn 't be concerned . Just migraines . Why are you lying , Matthew ? Why don 't you go check with CalTech on any new seismic activity ? Our remote sensors might 've missed ? So , GenC0 's parent company is YVX Enterprises . And who sits on the board of YVX ? A man named Ronald Forge , who also sits on the board of Trans Nova Oil . It gets better . YVX has holdings in several research companies , two of which , Lycon and QHTT , they received grant funding from ... Trans Nova . You have one guy sitting on both boards ? That doesn 't prove that he cooked the research findings . It 's hardly circumstantial . They have oversight . It 's not like they 're operating in a vacuum . Well , what about Lycon and QHTT ? Corporations offer research grants all the time to all sorts of companies . Now , Lycon , they 're working on ways to break down oil compounds for better clean-up . So , you just you think this whole thing is a coincidence ? The dead cows , fish ? People getting sick ? And the company that 's supposed to determine whether or not there 's any contamination has ties to Trans Nova ? We 've filed 13 lawsuits against Trans Nova . They 've heard it all . E.P.A. reports on the drill are clean , and they 're not friendly with oil companies . Until you can prove a link to all this , - it 's not enough . - Why can 't we just say there is ? You know , we put them on the defensive . The more they have to explain themselves , the more guilty they 're gonna sound . It 's unethical . No . What they 're doing is unethical . Thought you believed that . I 'll need the rest of the E.P.A. documents by Monday . Ask to Jeanine , she 'll have them ready . Alright . Hey ! Excuse me ? Emily ? Is there anyone who isn 't on your payroll ? He 's an advisor . We hired him to comply with federal regulations , as we 've always done . Right . Are you paying off the labs as well ? The testing in Maple Grove ? GenCo ? You know , people are getting sick , Dad , so why don 't you try telling the truth for once ' ? Do you think that 's something we would do ? Everyone is watching Trans Nova , every company wants to emulate what you 're doing here , so , yes , I think that 's something you would do . What 's a few sick people and some dead cows when there 's billions at stake , right ? You 're not that ignorant , Emily . You drive a car , like everyone else . You heat your home . People take it for granted , they expect it . They bitch and moan when gas goes up another nickel . They vilify our profits , but we have invested more funding in green energy than any company in the world . We ... We see the writing on the wall ! But it 's not going to happen overnight . The world needs oil . Cheap oil ! And guess what ? Clean oil . That 's what you wanted . That 's what we 're delivering . Yeah , you 're right . I 'm not that ignorant . And I know you 'll get that oil at any cost . But , you know , when people can 't breathe the air , or drink their own water , when is the cost too high ? Anything ? Well , these two anomalies ... although unusual , not unheard of , I 'm just having a hard time making a connection here . Well , I don 't believe in coincidences . Yeah , well , life is a coincidence , so . Oh , come on . You don 't believe that . You think all of this is just one big accident ? Well , tell you what . When there 's a few less stupid people on the planet , I 'll give your theory on Intelligent Design a little more thought . Intelligent or not , there 's definitely gotta be design to it . Why ? Well , I 'm ... I 'm not saying that we don 't make choices . I mean , look at me . But why do I make these choices ? Cause it 's all been worked out by something , or someone , well beyond our grasp . And what about all the people who draw the short straw ? Who decides that ? That 's the mystery , Doc . That 's been the conundrum since we started walking upright . We need to petition USGS for more sensors , keep a closer eye on any new activity . You 're fun . Do it . A beer , please . You 've got some balls , man . Why do you show your face in this town ? Cause I live here . Got as much right as you do . I 'll have a draft . I think a draft beer sounds great . I 'll take one of those , Devon . Frickin ' tree-hugger . Thank you . Cheers . Do you know who I am ? Samuel Janen . Five years ago , you took seven tourists into the old mines without authority . Four of them died from poisonous gas . It was manslaughter , wasn 't it ? Involuntary . One was them was your brother 's eight-year-old son . Thanks for the beer . Hey . Look . Just wait . Please ? What do you want , lady ? To ask you some questions . People are getting sick , and I think it has something to do with the Paxton well . You , more than anybody , might know what 's happening . It was an accident , what happened . I think everybody knows that . Do they ? So then why did you come back ? I have my reasons . May have been five years , but it was a life sentence for what I did . Living somewhere else isn 't going to change that . You were a miner . You knew every inch of those tunnels . How could that much gas have been leaking without you knowing ? There was a tremor that morning . I felt it , just like I 'd felt a hundred like it before . There was never any problem , but that morning , there was gasses that vented into the one tunnels that I didn 't test , the only one I didn 't test , and before I knew it , it was too late . I carried him ... I held him in my arms when I got out . There was oxygen in the truck , and I did everything I could . They had to pr ... They had to pry him out of my hands . For five years , that prison cell felt like ... it felt like those tunnels caving in every night . I 've spent my whole life underground , and now I can 't so much as walk into a bar without feeling the walls crashing in . I sleep outside ... so I can feel the wind and know that the air is clean . I 'll never go back down there again . I 'm sorry . I don 't know your brother , but ... maybe this needs to happen between the two of you , on his terms . Well , you asked why I came back . So , you ... you think that it was a tremor that caused the leak ? Volcanic . Volcanic gasses . So these people that are getting sick in Maple Grove , do you think it could be due to an increase in volcanic activity ? Well , it could be . Enough gas to poison people in a mine is one thing , there 's nowhere for it to escape . But above ground it dissipates . Unless it 's ... Unless what ' ? Unless it 's not so dormant . Dylan ? Is this Emily Booth ? Yeah , speaking . Who 's this ? I shouldn 't be talking to you right now . I shouldn 't be talking to anybody . Excuse me . What 's your name ' ? Listen , my name 's not important . What 's important is that I know things that the public doesn 't . Like what ? Like what we 're doing up there . Do you ... Do you mean the Paxton Well ? So , what ? So , what , do you work there ls the well causing the gas leaks ? No , you don 't get it . The gas leaks , they 're nothing compared to what could happen . I 'm not an expert , I don 't really know , but at these depths ... Are you ... Are you drilling deeper than permitted ? Look , why don 't we talk ' ? We can meet face-to-face . They 're lying to the public . Alright ? It 's all a bunch of lies . Hello ' ? Hello ! Dr. Cooper ? Dr. Cooper , open up ! It 's important . I 'm sorry for the way that I spoke to you the other day , but I really need to talk to you . May I come in ? Looks like you already have . Spring cleaning ? Yeah , something like that . What can I do for you ? During the Senate hearing , you said that there was a danger drilling to certain depths in this area . Why ? Engineers use thermal technology to find oil deposits . Unfortunately , oil can be easily mistaken for compressed magma . You tap into a magma chamber , and you could set off an eruption . And you think that could happen here ? In theory , but it 's unlikely . Why is that ? Well , depth , for one . They 're not drilling deep enough to reach magma . Number two , it would pretty much take a perfect scenario of , you know , compressed magma , drill points , chamber vents , etc . But the gasses that we 've seen here recently , isn 't that evidence of that kind of scenario ? Well , there are a lot of scenarios that have nothing to do with that drill . Maybe you 're trying to connect dots that don 't exist . Well , aren 't you trying to connect those same dots ? I mean , you were concerned out at that farm . Or are you just doing another report for Trans Nova Oil ? Okay . Thank you very much . Okay , no , I 'm sorry . What ... what if I have proof that they 're drilling deeper than permitted ? Look , I check the E.P.A. reports every day . They 're not , alright ? They 're doing everything to code . I know I can be rude , and I know I can be pushy , and I even know I 'm wrong half the time , I don 't think I 'm wrong with this . There 's something happening at that well . If I 'm wrong , I 'll walk away , they can take as much oil as they want . If I 'm right , we could be standing on a ticking time bomb . And you think you can prove this ? Yeah , with your help . So , looking for what vented the C02 that killed the fish , there was a small substrate shift at 20,000 meters . Measured at 3.7 . The hypocenter was directly under the well site , but that was just over five months ago . And the drill was shut down when ? April 22nd . Earth Day . Well , that event could 've easily have released the C02 that eventually found its way to the lake . But now check this out . The incident at the farm ? Almost the exact same event . 20,000 meters . Are you sure that 's all this guy had to say ? Yeah . Just he thought that they were drilling at depths that could be dangerous . Doc , E.P.A. " Doc ? " Cute . Daniel , what do you got ? Well , I took another look . We have an hourly monitor on the well site and their specs are at code or above . Well , has there been a physical inspection ? Yeah. last week . Nobody 's climbing down there with a tape measure , if that 's what you mean . But the computers don 't lie . We have double-redundancy on the Paxton well . There 's an insider at the well who says they 're drilling deeper than 10,000 meters . Seriously ? What can I say ? I mean , either the computer 's lying or he is . We stand by our monitoring , Matthew . Alright . We 'll get back to you . Thanks . So , you sure it wasn 't some crackpot who just wants to say anything to shut down the well ? Yes , I 'm sure . Well , if we don 't have him , we don 't have a link . Dylan ! Hey ! Hey , you . I 'm really sorry about the other day . I ... I got you something . I put a bunch of games on here . There 's an account , if you want to get more . Dad said I can 't have a phone , and they 're not allowed at school . One more detention , and I could get suspended . Okay , well , let 's just keep it between us until I talk to your dad , okay ? Just promise you 'll answer if I call . I will . Mom ' ? Thanks . This is cool . You 're welcome . - Hello ? - Can you meet me ? Yeah ! Where ' ? Hector , keep an eye on number four compressor . It was tweaking a little earlier . It 's reading " normal " now . Alright . I got a dentist appointment . Dentist ? What , now ? Yeah . I gotta go , man . Alright . - Hey . - You didn 't answer your phone . Yeah , I have to be in Portland in the morning . He called back . He wants to meet . Who 's he ? This is Matthew Cooper , he 's a geologist . He needs to hear this . Cooper ' ? He works for Trans Nova Oil . Wait a second ! I signed off on that well I need to know the truth . Alright . Listen . Nobody cares about the oil at 10,000 meters . They 're after the oil at 25,000 . There 's enough there to rival the Middle East . How could they be drilling that deep without anyone knowing ? Every piece of data that comes from that well site , all the pertinent information like the depths , temperature , volume , friction it all comes through the computers . Now , those computers have been reprogrammed to say anything that Trans Nova Oil wants them to say . The data 's wrong . Yeah , well , that ... I mean , that violates every single code Who cares what it violates ? Once we start pulling oil from those reserves , cleanly and safely , there 's not an administration in the world that could put that toothpaste back in the tube . Trans Nova Oil will be happy to pay the fine . 25,000 meters , are you sure ? Yeah . Yeah . I run the drill . I 'm one of two people at the site who knows . Yeah , well , your geologists got it wrong . I did my own analysis when they built that thing . What they think they 're seeing at 25,000 meters isn 't oil , it 's magma , potentially compressed magma . Even with the most sophisticated equipment in the world , it 's tough to tell the difference . Well , there was vibration . It could ... It could be that it was , subterranean interference .. You know , it could 've been a natural tremor . Our indicators say normal , But I 'm convinced it 's something else , a reaction of trapped gas . I 've felt it before , not-not quite like this , but ... Yeah . I think we 're getting pretty close to something very big . I gotta get outta here . We have to go public with this . I can 't do that . I can 't do that . You try to force me to do that , I 'll deny everything . I 've given you all I have . Go figure it out . So 25,000 meters ? Assume it 's a substrate compression , highly compressed . Is that magma ? Well , that 's what they think is the oil deposit . How can they not know the difference ? Well , this-this method of extraction is new . They start with thermal detection , but , you know , that can only go so deep . The rest is calculated with state-of-the-art software , but the variables are the same . Right . So how do you tell if it is magma ? Depth , compression , other gasses we 've been able to test . Experience . I certainly hope I 'm Wrong . You know , most people think that when lava gets out , that 's when the pressure 's released . Well , that 's not always true . It 's the release of underground gasses that can increase combustion and cause a chain reaction . Along the entire caldera ... which doesn 't necessarily make one big boom , it could set off 50 small ones . Did my homework . Well , " small " being relative , but still , " small " enough to wipe out five square miles , and multiply that by 50 . - Unless ... - Unless what ? This . Worst-case scenario . The entire caldera erupts , not just a handful of small ones . The last time that happened was 200,000 years ago , and it completely flattened a thousand square miles . It 'll change life as we know it . You can go in now , Hector . Alright . Thank you . Hector . Thanks for coming in after work like this . I 'm sure you 're tired . Come . Have a seat . You want a drink ? Oh , no , thank you . Well , I 'm gonna have one . I 'm up on the daily reports . We 're very happy . I 've meant to come up and see you boys , but there 's always fires to put out down here . We 're still stretching our legs in Paxton . Good people , though . Yeah , I understand that , Mr. Booth . No , no , no . " Oliver , " please . Sit . Okay I don 't want to bring up anything uncomfortable , but someone just told me that you lost a son a few years back . Yeah . I 'm very sorry to hear that . Thank you . I lost my daughter , in a way . Not what you experienced , of course . It was a falling out a long time ago . You probably know who she is . I 've heard of her , yes . Of course you have . It 's no secret . She 's been a thorn in our side ... ever since we proposed this site . How 's that for irony ? An oil man 's daughter is a die-hard environmentalist . Mm . You 've never met ? No . No . I just thought , you know , small town , people know each other . Listen , Hector . The reason that I ask is because you need to realize that if you ever come into contact with Emily , if she ever approaches you , for information , that her motives are not always as righteous as she leads people to believe . As said , I 'm not on her " most admired " list . But look ... we 're in this together . You 've been trusted with sensitive information , which is why you signed the confidentiality agreement , but more importantly , we shook hands , you and I. So , obviously , there won 't be a problem . No , sir . No problem . Good . Hey , say hi to your wife for me . It 's Ana , right ? Yes . Yeah . I will . Alright . Thank you for coming in . You 're welcome . Thank you . So what are you gonna do ? I 'm just gonna go to work and keep my mouth shut . Well , and if your instincts are right ' ? They 're not . I 'm wrong . They 've got millions invested in this thing . They 're not gonna jeopardize everything . Not unless it 's safe . I never should 've contacted her . Well , she doesn 't know who you are ! I don 't know . All that press five years ago . I - I think she recognized me . I don 't know . I 'm getting paranoid . Hey ... We are having a son . What ? Really ? Yes . And I spoke to Mr. Larson about going back to work at the hospital . Just ... Just part-time , until the baby 's born . Now , there 's that smile I 've been missing . You have been so patient with me . I love you . I love you too , baby . Don 't have to feel guilty . It 's 100 % recycled . Come on , man . You can 't be that blind to what 's going on here . Don 't you understand the consequences ? They 're not going to stop with this . They do this here , they can do it everywhere . Then what 's left ? Is that really worth a job with these people ? When I 'm trying to make insurance ? Rent ? Can 't afford to buy a frickin ' birthday present for my little girl ? Yeah . Yeah . It 's worth it . That 's what I lose sleep over . Those are my responsibilities . What do you got ? It 's what I don 't have . Apathy ... Hank the Tank . It still gets under your skin , doesn 't it ? I was one of those guys in high school who called you that . Court order says you all need to be across the street ! Come on , man ! Here 's your chance ! Retribution . " Hank the Tank ! " Hank the Tank ! Hank the Tank ! Yeah ! It 's already posted online ! You lose ! Is Hector available ? No , please . Please , wait . He doesn 't want to talk to you . I know , but it 's really important that I speak with him . Just leave us alone , okay ? I think something is happening at the well , and I think that your husband might be in danger . Just please , have him call me . Hector speaking . She was here . Looking for you . Thanks . Matthew ' ? Yeah . Yeah . I 'm on my way . What we usually look for in the subduction zone is what we call " land-breathing . " It 's ground elevation caused by subterranean pressure . Do you think that 's happening here ? Well , we haven 't seen any , but with all this C02 , it 's definitely worth another look . Even a few inches could be alarming . Your grandfather used to work in the mines , right ? I read that he helped petition the federal government to designate most of this land as a National Preserve . That 's quite the history . When you said this was your backyard , you weren 't kidding . Yeah . My grandfather was a pretty great guy . When I was a kid , he used to bring me rocks , and it could be the most boring , most plain rock you 've ever seen , he had a story for it . Its history , how it connects to everything around us . Used to always say , " it 's not just a rock . It 's not just land . It 's who we are . It 's what will become of us , and it 'll be here long after we 're gone . " I think he wanted that to belong to everyone , you know ? So when Trans Nova moved in , I wanted to be on the inside , to make sure they did things right . Anything ? No . We probably won 't know until we compare it with the satellite imagery , then we 'll ... Did you feel that ? Yeah . Is it an earthquake ? No . I don 't think so . What the hell is that ? Come on . What ? Guys ! We gotta go . Let 's line up . Decide who you 're sitting with . One at a time . Hey ! One at a time . Hey ! Give that back to him . Stop it . Get on now . Let 's go . Come on . Dylan . Come on . Okay , make sure you have your backpacks and lunches . There are bathroom facilities at the park , but it 's about an hour drive , so if you have to go , go now . Once you pick a seat , stick to it until we get there . And remember , no cell phones , video cameras , or iPods , unless you like detention . Dylan , is your mom coming ? I don 't think so . Okay Mr. Booth ? Mr. Booth . - I need to talk to you right away . - Dr. Cooper I 've got some people I 'm going to meet at the Mayor 's office . Can it wait until this afternoon ? No . Actually , there 's a major problem developing at the well . You need to shut it down . I 'm sorry . I thought I heard you say " Shut it down . " - Listen to me . - Hey ! Hey . First of all , you lied to me . You 're drilling deeper than 20,000 meters . But more importantly , what you think is a large oil deposit is , in fact , compressed magma . Now , if you rupture that chamber , you could cause a catastrophic volcanic event . I would be very careful , Dr. Cooper . It doesn 't matter how you slice it , you still signed off on this well . Yeah . That 's exactly right , and that 's why you 're gonna shut it down ! Listen to me ! A magma drop-out opened up less than 10 miles away from here . Do you know what that means ? It is a precursor to a major eruption . We 've already contacted USGS , the Mayor and the Governor . Can you prove this has anything to do with our well ? You 're our expert , Dr. Cooper . I want your professional opinion . I can tell you what I do know . If what 's happening here continues , this entire caldera on which we 're standing right now , where thousands of people go to school , go to work , camp , hike , and fish , is gonna go up in a series of eruptions that 'll make Mount St. Helene look like a fifth-grade science project . Shut it down . Just ... Just listen to me . We have multiple level-four ventings . Dr. Cooper is requesting a geothermal testing of the entire caldera . This is an escalating event that needs immediate attention ! Look , I just ... I can 't authorize something like that without - Sir ? Sir . Just ... take a look outside your window . Just take a look at the bright blue sky , because it 's not gonna be there much longer if you don 't get this done . Without the proper paperwork , there 's nothing I can do . Geez ! Look , if we post this now , there might still be time . Telling people to evacuate Paxton ? It 'll cause a panic . We have to do something . Could you imagine the liability ? The gasses are venting now . And where are the police ? They 're investigating , but there 's still too much red tape . Exactly ! For a reason . Dr. Cooper has already contacted other agencies . He 's ... That guy who works for the oil company ? You 're riding his wave now ? Look . We have to warn people . We 're the only ones that will say what 's actually going on here . No , " we " don 't . I can 't put us out on a limb like that , Emily . Sorry . " She 'll be coming round the mountain . " " when she comes . " " She 'll be coming round the mountain . " Tommy ! Hey . No . " She 'll be coming round the mountain . " " when she comes . " You don 't want to sing , Dylan ? " She 'll be riding six white horses . " " when she comes . " " She 'll be riding six white horses . " So USGS is coming , although they didn 't sound like they were in a hurry . There 's " paperwork " involved . Can they shut down the drilling ? No . No . They 'd have to go through legal channels . By the time Washington gets off their ass it 'll be too late . You okay ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm fine . Look , we need this guy , Hector , okay ? He 's the operations manager at the well . He either needs to come out or shut it down himself . So how do we get to him ? As of now , I still work for them , right ? Let 's go . Hey , Dylan . Anything you want to talk about ? Like what ? Whatever you want . You 're a good student , one of the smartest kids I know , but lately , your grades haven 't really shown that ... or your interest in anything , for that matter . I just want to know what 's going on . Maybe I 'm not that smart . You can talk to me . I think it has to do with your mom , right ? My dad will barely let me see her . And you 're kind of mad about it ? I guess . That 's okay . Tell you what . When we get back , let 's sit down , and you write your parents a note , write it all down , everything you 're feeling , and you can decide if you want to give it to them or not , but if you at least see it for yourself , it 'll help . Trust me . Deal ? Okay In the meantime , why don 't you go collect some more of those spruce cones ? Use them for your class presentation . It 's a pine cone . See ? Back off ! Give them some room ! Another report for the damn E.P.A. , Dr. Cooper ? Yeah . Something like that . My God . Edward , call Mr. Booth . Tell him we 're there sooner than we thought . I 'm on it . I 'm surprised my father hasn 't blocked your access yet . Yeah , but we 're not inside yet . But if Hector doesn 't listen ... We 'll have to find the off-switch Look at the size of it . How 's the pressure ? Normal . Ramp it down . We 've got a spike at 16,000 meters . Thermal readings are racing . Increase viscosity 20 % . 20 % . Still rising . Take it to 40 . 40 ! Where 's our coolant ? It 's there , but we 're losing volume ! Four and five can 't keep up ! Friction levels are still reading the same . - How 's the pressure ? - The same ! Doesn 't make any sense . Where 's the heat coming from ? Maybe we have a bad component . Oh , my God ! Excuse me , Oliver . Can I get you to sign these , please ? All right . This is Oliver . Mr. Booth , we 've had a major breach . We need to detonate and cap now . Well , slow down , Hector . What the hell are you talking about ? We 've drilled into a highly compressed lava chamber . It 's not oil down there . It 's molten lava , it 's coming up the chamber . We need to cap it now . Wait . Can 't you just shut down the valves ? It 's past that . If we wait , the lava moves up , possibly to the inner chamber ... We need to cap it right now . Oliver , that will compromise the entire rig . Hector , we have triple-redundancy there . Detonating the cap is a last resort ... Hector ! Hector ! Initiate detonation . You 're serious ? Just do it . Get them out of there . They 're not picking up ! Get somebody up there . Tell Jeanine to get me on-line with them ! Okay . Right away . Set ? Do it . Turn off those damn alarms now ! Everybody to the top ! Everybody , get to the top , now ! Seal the compartment . Implement safety procedures . Get out now ! Everybody to the top . Come on ! Let 's go ! Make sure the auxiliary vents are on ! Glen ! The pumps are still out ! Why is there smoke ? What 's happening ? Audrey ! Epicenter 10 miles northwest of the well site . I 'm patching into USGS now . Audrey ! Your readings are wrong ! The epicenter 's at the well site ! It 's right on top of us . Audrey ! Everybody , let 's get back on the bus ! Andrea , come on . Let 's go ! Hurry . Come on , guys , let 's go . Base , this is 1-9-8-6 . Glen ! Make sure the valves are open ! Make sure the valves are open ! Do it ! As soon as two goes down , go to system three ! Go manual ! Forget automatic ! Go manual ! It 's accelerating . C02 's off the dial . How are we gonna get outta here ? Just give me a minute . It will be right at the edge of the blast area ! Audrey ! Check the phone lines . Check them . - Anything ? - Nothing . There 's no response . There 's no response ! - Edward ? - There 's nothing . We got to get in there ! There may still be people alive ... Don 't open that door ! They 're dead out there . We try to get out , we 're dead , too . Just take it easy . You can see , behind me here , through the trees , a large plume of ash and it 's very close . We felt a major earthquake just seconds ... No ! I want the control room . Well , keep trying . Has anyone gotten up to the well ? They were 10 minutes away . I tried calling , but they 're not picking up either . Track down the Sheriff . Tell him we had a distress call just moments before we lost all communication . Maybe he 'll send a deputy . And we need to get back online with their computer . Everything 's down . Well , somebody has to figure it out . Those computers may be the only way we 're gonna reach those boys . What are we gonna do about Atlanta ? What about Atlanta ? Well , corporates gonna be wanting us to think about a strategy here , - Oliver . - Strategy ' ? We don 't even know what happened here yet ! Right now , I want eyes and ears on the ground up there . So that we can figure out what happened . The sky 's already darkening , the ash plume rising higher and higher . It 's hard to see here . I 'm trying to get a better view . Pan back to the tree-line . Police are trying hard to get people out of here . And the wind has picked up . And it keeps coming . Come on . Let 's get inside . Where 's Dylan ' ? No , he 's gone ! Dylan ! Dylan ! Dylan ! Come on ! Come on ! Of sulphur . As you can see , there 's a better view Go , go , go , go , go , go ! Audrey ! Matthew ? I - I just got off with CalTech . It 's worse than we thought ! Increased activity throughout the Ring of Fire . The Ring of Fire ? What ... About 75 % of the world 's volcanoes . Hey . Hey . Hey I can 't breathe . Where are the others ? I don 't know where anyone is , I lost them . There is ... there is no one else . Come on . Come on . We gotta go . We gotta go . Come on . Come on ! The well 's gone , Oliver . They 're all gone . Well , still , all communications are down . Then how are they gonna know We 're alive in here ' ? They 're not . My son ... He 's out there . He was on a field trip . Matthew ! Come on ! Close them ! Close the windows . It won 't close ! My window won 't close . Help me ! Mine doesn 't close ! Matthew ! How long do you think that will hold ? I don 't know . The heat sensors are knocked out . There 's no way outta here . - Are you okay ? - Yeah ... Let 's see . Let 's see . No , I 'm fine , Dr. Cooper . No , you 're not fine . Sit down . Sit down . Okay . Volcanic ash is made out of microscopic shards of glass . It 'll get into that wound and out it , it 'll make it fester . We need to clean it , okay ' ? We were lucky . We were on the edge of the blast range . Any closer , and our lungs would already be infected , being cut by that ash with every breath Well , it 's pretty much still like breathing poison . We have to get out of here . How close is too close ? You mean for your son ? Yeah . Look , the best thing we can do is get back into town . I 'm sure he 's there , at the school , okay ? Come on . Come on . Is anybody hurt ? Tommy 's hurt . - Oh , no ! - Oh , no , Tommy 's hurt ! Does anyone have a picnic blanket ? I have one . Under his head . Hello ? Can anybody hear this ? Why are these geysers happening here ? The eruption was miles away . Well , a caldera is basically like a giant volcano crater . It can spread for miles . When it erupts , it doesn 't just erupt in one place , like a stratovolcano , like Mount St. Helene , it can erupt in many different places , basically wherever that compressed magma can find a way out . Right . So these geysers , they 're , like , smaller explosions ? Essentially . And the Ring of Fire ? The Ring of Fire stretches from Yellowstone to Indonesia . It 's about 75 % of the world 's volcanoes . Now , there is a scenario that 's improbable but possible , where an eruption could trigger the rest . And if that happens ? It 's what 's called an " E.L.E. " " Extinction-level event "

 1x02 - Going Nuclear transcript and sync : f1nc0 Everything going alright ? Smooth as silk . Right on schedule . Tony Stark ... a brilliant futurist and a CEO of a multi-billion dollar corporation , enherited by his father , is also ... in his sparetime ... the superhero Iron Man . And I thought he was just a airhead playboy with too much money have been heared by the defence committee . Industrialist Tony Stark is just now entering the Parliament building , to testify on his ARC reactor . On the agenda Stark will have to answer questions about the nuclear element involved in the reactor , and rumors that he is illegaly smuggling plutonium into the country . Come on , Ichiro ! Grab your camera , let 's go ! One more sake ... Minister Kuroda , that 's absurd . Why would I smuggle plutonium into Japan ? Perhaps to avoid controversy . In any case , we know that there 's a ship and it was transporting plutonium . A simple cargo ship . Without any military escort . It was attacked and the plutonium stolen . The ship is registered to one of your companies , Mr. Stark . Well , it seems pretty obvious , someone is trying to set me up . This situation is akward , to say at least , to say nothing about danger posed . You want me fo get missing plutonium back for you ? Is that it ? Because we both know I can do that . That won 't be necessary . Our maritime self-defence force has been alerted . They can handle it . Besides I think you already have enough on your plate , Mr. Stark ... Mr. Stark , it has been eleged that which you are trying to ... secretly bring nuclear material into this country . How would you respond ? What 's wrong ? No answer ? Oh I have an answer . But I 'm just trying to come up to curiosed way to freeze it . Oh , I think I 've got it . It 's a freaking lie . Mr. Stark ! How do you respond to the rumors that you 're building nuclear weapons ? - Any comment , sir ? - A statement ? Could you give us details about what you and Minister Kuroda have discussed ? Would you release a statement ? - Thanks a lot Ishiro , we 're late ! - We ... We missed everything . Mr. Stark ! Are you planning a stand ? Perfect timing , would you mind giving me a lift ? Thank you . Wow ... what ? But ... sure . - Tony ! - Wait , Tony ! - Cut them off ! - Just one more question , sir ! - Huchy muchy ... - Let 's get outta here . I can 't believe my luck . I 've get a second chance to an exclusive . Listen Nanami , I do 't know if you 're busy tonight , but I think I owe you one for saving my life , back there . How about taking you out to dinner ? Some place special , your choise , anywhere you want . - Thanks , but I prefer the interview ... - And a few photos , maybe ? Pretty please ? Oh sorry , my bad . Did I just asked you to a dinner date in front of your boyfriend ? Hey look , no problem . He can come too , but we 'll maybe skip the candle-light , what you say ? - He 's your friend , right ? - Of course not . He ist just photographer I work with ! A boyfriend ? Please ... A simple no would suffice ... So then , Mr. Stark ... Most of Japan think you 're trying smuggling plutonium into the country . You know the rumors , are they true or not ? Well , while you 're keeping quiet , the stock price of Stark Industries is going into free fall . I don 't get it , if they 're just silly rumors , why not come out and say so ? Tell people what you really do . I can tell your side of the story , help improve your image with the japanese public . I see , we 're back in serious reporter role , now . That 's right , Mr. Stark ! The new me ... Oh , that 's a crime shame . I 'm beginning to miss the old you , already . Why I just can 't wait with him ? At least he remembers me . that 's something ... Nice to meet you , Ichiro . Thanks for the ride . I 've got bigger problems right now that my image . But strange as it seems , she might just have a point . Maritime SDF here . We 've finished complete search of that cargo ship , turned up nothing . Roger . Alright , let 's se what we 've got here ... Scanning the interior . Traces detected ... human . What the ... Hey , are you okay ? What happened here ? Some kind of creature ... we couldn 't escape it ... that plutonium ... you have to hurry ... Alright , switching from infrared sensors to radiation detection . Energy signature detected . Well , now we know the plutonium really was here ... Warning ! Unknown hostile detected . Oh , that can 't be good . Impact imminent . You 've got to be kidding me ... Can 't turn the corner without running to a killer robot , these days ... I am a Cancer . Warrior of the great Zodiac . Where did you get that name ? Out of a super-villain handbook ? Oh , that 's gonna be expensive ... Oh boy ... I 'd like to say it was a lot of fun ! But it hasn 't ! Connect me with Minister Kuroda . Minister , good news . I 've found the cargoship in question . Yes ... and ? I am afraid that the team you sent investigate it , has been wiped out . Wiped out ? Sir , are you familiar with Zodiac ? It 's a terrorist organization , the 're little known for connection with A.I.M. ( Advanced Idea Mechanics ) Whatever is going on here , they 're the ones behind it . Really ? That sounds big fetched up . I believe I asked to stay out of this , Mr. Stark ? We don 't need your assistance . Frankly , these outlander 's conspiracy theories strike me as ... to refuge of a desperate man who want something to hide . Oh really ? Well I guess I 'm gonna have to prove you 're wrong then . The only way is to find that plutonium myself and get it back safely . I don 't think it 's a very good idea , Mr. Stark . I 'll let you know what I 'll find , Minister Kuroda . Mr. Stark ... What is every ship in this country deserted ? Access surveilance video . Yeah , that 's it . Now , reverse the image . Freeze . Bingo . Alright . Access Stark Industries satelite 004 . Ok . Lock on to track the target . Give me a 3D traffic model . Good . Keep on tracking it and upload the coordinates to the Iron Man armor . Don 't worry , Nanami ... there 'll be plenty of opportunities to interview him . You 'll see . No , I 'll never get close to Tony Stark again ! You 've got to stop beating yourself up ... - What is it ? - There was Tony Stark who just passed by ! And why didn 't you say something ? I 'm going to get that interview even if he kills me . Oh ! I 'm not enjoying this ! I 'll borrow your camera , okey ? What ? Nanami , wait ! I can 't let here my baby ! - Mind if I borrow your scooter ? - Hey ! Freedom of the press ! Do not worry , I 'll bring it right back ! Minister Kuroda , would you tell the mayor of Kioto , that I 'm sorry about the traffic jam ? - What traffic jam ? - That I 'm about to make happen . What 's going on ? - Why all that traffic ? - Well ? Well what ? We can 't sit here ! Go around it , get us out of here ! That 's it , come to papa . Gotcha . What else can go wrong , we have someone on our tail . What ? Great . We have to lose that guy before we get to the rendezvous ! So we 're gonna play a little hard to get , are we ? Don 't wanna hurt you just wanna slow you down a little bit . - Come on , shake him , will you ? - Shut up and let me drive ! A check point , oh come on ! Down there ! Wrong way ! Okay , maybe I wanna hurt you a little . He 's now firing missiles ! As if the stairs weren 't bad enough ... Now this car shooted the scooter ... Hand over the case ! Nice and easy ! Ok , that 's enough ! Ceise and desist , before any more innocent people get hurt ! And you 're name would be ? Let 's just say I 'm concerned citizen ! We can make it to the rendezvous ! Let 's go ! Right ! Where is the camera ? I 've got to get a shot of this ! Listen concerned citizen , would you mind getting out of my way ? Are you kidding me ? Do you relize how many laws you 've just broken ? Hm , let me think ... no , I don 't know . Listen pal , you 're standing between me and something that 's bigger than you . Please get out of the way . I don 't care how importany you think you are . This country is not your presonal playground . You Americans think you can come here and do ... Eh , excuse me ! Sorry to interrupt , but ... We didn 't finished our interview , Mr. Stark ! I have a few more questions ... Well she 's persistant ... Not the best time , Nanami . - What is that thing ? - Get to safety , now ! Now it gets interesting . Her case ? Gettin ' radioactive readings ? It 's that girl ! She must have it ! Go get her , move it ! Why are you following me , what did I do ? This is so not fair , where is Iron Man when you need him ? Wow . Nice stealth tech ... No readings ... no footprint at all , I can 't shoot ... This is Nagato Sakurai of the National Self-defense Force ! We have emergency , we need to clear the road ! There you are ! You 're mine now ! Wow , I 've got a feeling I 'm out of my league here ! Not ... good ... Surrender the plutonium . Iron Man . Surrender the plutonium . You want the plutonium ? Come and get it ! Bad boy . Round and round ... where he 'll stop ... who cares ... Here 's what cure cancer ! And so Tony Stark was forced to lock in Iron Man armor once again ... in order to clear himself of these false rumors and alegations . Perhaps the Japanese public will learn the lesson from this . So instead of discrimination ourself we shouldn 't be so quick ro discriminate against those who 're different from us . Hi , Nanami ! Ichiro ! I forgot ... Sorry about your camera , I 'll pay you back right of my next paycheck ... No , that 's not it ! Look what came for you ... These are gorgeous ... Who can they be from ? Looking forward to our 3rd date . Tony Stark . Yeah , I guess he 's paying you back for writing such a flatering article . Oh , you 're right ... I 'm sure that 's what it is . I 've read your report . So tell me , now that you 've met him , what do you make of Tony Stark ? A man of action . Someone who certainly doesn 't mind ... breaking few laws , to get what he 's after . H 's reckless , sir . And my opinion , dangerously so . Yes , I see ! I 'll keep that in mind .

 Previously on Continuum ... Liber8 is behind this attack . I know it . You fight a disease by catching it while it 's still treatable . Halo will monitor you on every level . You have 60 days , Mr. Sadler . We did not gas that building . We did not kill those people . Then who did ? [ fighting grunts ] Nealon 's been a merc for years . He works through a contractor named Grey Point Security . I don 't mind learning a few things from Betty . [ gunshot ] [ gasps ] It 's busy tonight . Rumors of another anti-congress crackdown . How was the gala ? We all have our crosses to bear . Let 's get started . Citizen Chip extraction will commence . Number 1 . When your number is called , sit in the chair . You are aware that Citizen Chip extraction renders your birth certification and Citizenship null and void ? I 'm aware . Extend your arm through the indicators and bite down on the sanitized bit . Scan your wrist to accept the release . Got it . Extracting . Suction ? Yes , doctor . Please hold still . This may sting a little . [ muffled screaming ] Once finished , please toss your bit into the receptacle . Number 2 . Get off of me . Get off of me ! [ grunts ] Get your hands off me . Let go of him ! Get off me ! You 're the reason he 's upset . There 's no reason to hold him down . You 're okay . You 're okay . You 're okay . You 're okay . Get some water please . Give us some room please . I don 't know where I am . I don 't know where I am . You were taken to St. Paul 's unconscious . When you stabilized but you didn 't wake up you were brought here . Markum Palms , we 're a long-term care facility . We don 't know much about you . What do you want to know ? How about your name ? It 's um ... I don 't know ... I don 't know my name . How can I not know my ... I don 't know my name ! You 've been out almost two months . Extended loss of consciousness , this happens . I don 't ... Just take it slow . Anything you can tell us will help boost the recovery process . I remember a name . Cameron . Okay ? Cameron ? No . No that 's not me . Kiera Cameron . Sync corrections by caioalbanezi Web-dl sync by claus68 The service was beautiful . Yes it was . Betty paid the heaviest price for her convictions . I know what you want to do but you don 't need to go in there right now . Yeah , I do . [ knock ] The answer is still no . We have to do something . We can 't . Too much has gone down within this division lately . We are not trusted . We worked closest with her . Exactly . And it has been made very clear to me that finding Betty 's killer is not on our dance card . Independent investigation is handling it . It is done . That is a bullshit rap and you know it . Do you have any idea the strings I had to pull to get her buried with honours ? Trust me , it was not an easy thing given her past flirtations . And what if Liber8 did kill her ? Well then she died a hero . Staining her memory will not bring her back . Is that ... Is that the deal that you made ? They handle the investigation and Betty 's ties stay secret ? You and Cameron take the rest of the day . I will call you if I need you . I warned you . What 'd he say ? Oh that we should take some personal time . Which is good , cause I hate this thing anyway . I 've got three messages from some pushy doctor . There 's a John Doe at the hospital that 's been asking for me . Oh your day 's looking up . Hot date . Who are you ? Damn . You asked for me . This is Agent Cameron . She works with local law enforcement . Kiera Cameron ? Do I know you ? I was hoping . That 's gonna be a problem . Apparently they need the bed . There 's nothing wrong with you besides your memory . You 're healthier than me ! Sure you don 't recognize him ? I 'm sure . What happened ? They tell me I was hit by a truck . Physiologically there 's nothing wrong with him save a bad knee . All I can remember is Kiera Cameron . Usually with cases like this , long-term memory returns first but maybe he read your name somewhere . Sign there . Excuse me ? Medically speaking he can walk out of here right now . With a limp . Not with me . Look ... If I 'm lucky , they 'll send someone over here tomorrow then they 'll take him to you and you 'll print him and send out bulletins , whatever . Save a step . He 'll probably show up on your radar . I wouldn 't be so sure . Work with me on this Cameron . Gotta admit , he knows your name . Nice little mystery to solve . We are connected . Somehow . This is very ... well , I 'm intrigued . How 's it going ? Good . Well , not exactly good . I don 't want to bore you with all the corporate bullshit that I 've managed to inherit but development delays with Halo , I keep reaching for a competitive edge and coming up short , and then boardroom politics like you wouldn 't believe . Thank god for Jack Dillon . He 's at least one ally . What 's he like as a boss ? Is he a hard ass ? He seems like a hard ass . I buried a friend today . Wow . Sorry , that 's ... wow . And I 'm all ' oh the board 's a real drag ' . So why am I here ? I just can 't carry it alone anymore . It 's better if I show you . Holy shit . No . [ Crying ] Two of me . Two of her ? Yep . She lied to me . She swore that she told me everything but she still lied . You and me ? We 're originals . She was an original . But the other two ? I don 't know with them . They 're them , but they 're not at the same time . Know what I mean ? Oh yeah . Wish I didn 't . That 's why I brought you here . You 're the only one that understands what I 'm going through . ♪ Down the stairs ! Go around ! Go around ! ♪ [ sirens wailing ] [ sirens wailing ] ♪ Any of these landmarks look familiar to you ? Yes and no . Helpful . Well the city 's right , if that 's anything . I 'm not from Iowa or something . It all seems so different . Let me make a call . Yep . [ cell phone ringing ] What ? How hard would it for someone , assume someone local to just scrub themselves from every database . I 'm talking zero hits . No health information . No prints . Digital information of any kind . Next to impossible . Something would kick up somewhere . Why , is someone lying about who they are Kiera ? That would be terrible . I have a John Doe who 's a bit of a ghost , and I have checked every database I know . Every database . Well maybe he 's James Bond . I gotta go . Okay . You really think he can figure out who I am ? I 'll do whatever I can . I don 't want to be a ghost . You 've been keeping baker 's hours kid ? It 's been a tough day , Kellogg . It 's about to get tougher . I thought I 'd save you the indignity of this coming from a stranger , considering everything we 've been through . What 's this ? Uh , karma . By way of sharks in suits . You 're suing me ? For what ? Well you working at Piron is a breach of our contact . We had a deal . Are you serious ? As a heart attack . Not only did you sign an anti-compete clause but 49 percent of every scrap of genius that comes out of your little noggin belongs to me . And don 't forget , I happen to know how things turn out and just to be clear , the name SadTech is the winner of this horserace and right now that is the card I 'm holding . You mother ... Name calling is not going to make this any easier . You 've been served . I 'll see you in court . Is that your stray ? Mr. John Doe ? Yeah . Social services is backed up and you know what ? Let it go , Carlos . No it 's cute . Get kittens too ? What 'd they get ? An active camouflage system . It bends the light around an object to make it ... Invisible . This makes my head hurt . You ever heard of anything like this ? Uh once or twice , yeah . Three very high-tech robberies in as many weeks . One is an anomaly . Two is a coincidence . Three we 're talking pattern . The thief was familiar with the office . He knew the alarm system and the security camera coverage . He used advanced jamming tech to disable the CCTVs and just to add insult to injury , while the heist was going down someone hacked into the servers and grabbed all their proprietary engineering specs . Sounds like an inside job . Company swears no . They vet their people tighter than the NSA . Everyone has been accounted for . Alright . Who do we know in the advanced technology game ? You have to wear that ugly-ass patch ? That 's your father 's legacy . Look , that 's his contribution to Halo . Besides , we need it to tap into the synaptic system . Nobody 's going to want to slap a piece of plastic on their head . It needs to be just the bracelet . Uhhhh . Well maybe our graphing conductivity can be improved . No no no , we tried that . It just melted all over the table . Blegh , it was bad . Anyone else ? Anything ? Where 's Ericsson ? Williams ? Zamir ? Poof . Midnight raid . Wait , what ? It was very sad . SadTech kind of . They left to work for SadTech ? Yeah . Sorry . That snake . Was anybody going to tell me about this ? You mean like how I found out you 're being sued by Matthew Kellogg and SadTech ? That 's just Kellogg rattling my chain . No Alec , it is not . I 'm doing my best . Not when you let your head counsel get blindsided by a lawsuit like this . He has a claim . You did sign a non-compete . If this goes to court we will likely lose . Add that to a restive board . They gave me two months . I 'm trying to fix Halo . Money and patience take away at the same rate . The stock price wobbles and the boy genius CEO headlines all but disappear . The problem is no one really understands your vision . Oh I do . Figure out a way to get rid of this lawsuit . Buy me some time to fix this . I 'll try my best . Thanks . Our code doesn 't stand up . The prototypes are running too hot . I 'm fighting the deadline of my life here . Can I do this ? Yes . Yes . Listen . There are two or three things that you need for Halo , they 'll be widely available in ... 10 , maybe 9 years . This is so frustrating . Except for the high-tech connection , none of these robberies shows a pattern . And they superficially look like inside jobs but they can 't be . I need a favour . The care facility misplaced John Doe 's effects . They dropped them off here and I found this . I 've ID 'd the hotel . They have a long-term resident who paid three months in advance . Will you cover for me while I go check it out with him ? What is it with this guy ? I don 't know . But something . I 'll be quick . Please ? You owe me one . Thanks . Ring any bells ? No . No , sorry . Clearly I 'm not rich and I have low standards . That 's very disappointing . Do you read a lot of science fiction ? What ? The book . I don 't know . You getting as tired of that answer as I am ? You could say that . So , cheap and stupid . Guess I 'll have to get by on my looks . Like you don 't know what I 'm talking about . What 's that on your wrist ? It 's faded ink . And of course I don 't know what it means . But you did . At one point . It could be GPS coordinates . If the location is close to here , we could stop by and see if it jogs your memory . Okay . And if that doesn 't work , what 's next Kiera Cameron ? Then I think I 've gone as far with you as I can go . I 'm sorry . Well let 's go jog my memory . This is it . Well ? I don 't know , maybe . Look I 'm sorry . If I had even a hint I would .. You know what ? I don 't have time for maybe . I 'm sorry that what happened to you happened . I 'm sorry that my name is bouncing around in your head . I really am . Sorry . I get it . You think I 'm crazy . I think I 'm crazy . This all feels like a dream . My real life is just these images . These crazy images flashing around in my head . I get these flashes of faces that I think I should know , and I know them . I just don 't know how . I don 't know how . [ Phone rings ] Carlos ? Yeah Piron just got hit by our thief . Dillon 's going to blow a gasket . I 'll meet you there . I really do have to go . I was here . What do you mean ? This city . This same city . I was scrambling with other people . Shelled out black canyons with glass ... Concrete ... this is going to sound crazy . It 's like I 'm not of this place . Like I am not in this time . Are you okay ? I suppose if what they took actually worked then I 'd be angry . Maybe whoever robbed me can figure out how to fix it . Do you have any idea who could be behind these robberies ? No . Is there anyone you suspect might be an enemy ? You never know who your enemies are going to be in my position . You do all your research and development in house ? What are you getting at ? A lot of tech companies farm out the various components of whatever it is they 're building . I figured Halo might be the same . Yeah sure we do the same . A surface tech company from Korea . Batteries from Norway . The skin patch was actually developed right here in town . WCIT . WCIT Alpha Labs developed the invisibility cloak before it went commercial . We need to look into that . Thank you , Alec . What are friends for ? You think there 's something to this WCIT Alpha Labs link ? Well Bibby went to WCIT . Figured maybe a connection to Betty , a lead , something . It was a long shot . It was stupid . No , not at all . Have you , um , noticed Alec 's attitude ? He seems a little more arrogant than usual . Yeah , well , he said he was under a lot of pressure . Business going south . Maybe he 's looking for a shortcut to corporate riches . He said he was looking for a competitive edge ... his words . Are you saying that Alec staged the Piron robbery to avoid suspicion ? You 're not coming ? I 've got something to check out . It 's close by . I 'll walk . I got your back . You 're leaving ? No money , no room . You are one sad case . I know right ? Irresistible . I want to talk about what you said . Kiera Cameron I promise you , I am not crazy . Well you rented this place for three months . You 're right . Bananas . First girl I meet she sees right through me . That 's the thing . I do see right through you . You don 't have any health records . You 're not in any database . You 're invisible . You know how you said the city just didn 't feel right ? I felt that way too . Well maybe you 're insane . Maybe I 'm from the future . Oh well now you 're just trying to make me feel better . I do appreciate the gesture . I arrived here unexpectedly . Everything I knew , everything I loved was gone . But I found someone who helped me get through it . Ah . A friend . Someone who became a friend . So there 's hope for me ? I ... I don 't know why I trust you . But for some reason I do . I have a couch . You are welcome to it . For a few days . Three days max . Well I barely know you . Well if you have a better offer . No , no . I 'm just messing around . I would ... yeah . Kiera Cameron , that 's a deal . Why do you keep saying my whole name like that ? Keep hoping it will trigger something . And if it does , you 'll be the second to know . Let the record show this interview with Alec Sadler is voluntary . Alec I want to thank you for coming in and shedding light on this for us . Of course I 'm here voluntarily . I have nothing to hide and the idea that I staged a robbery at Piron to avoid suspicion is complete fantasy . So no Kiera , huh ? Just as well . Look guys , can we just skip to the end here ? I 've read the file . Under the terms of the Piron agreement , Alec has complete access . Look all this technology The active camo which is wicked by the way ... is all military or paramilitary tech . Well what about Halo ? Sure . I guess . But Jack can attest to the fact that we 're moving Piron away from military tech . I want to help people . Ask yourself . Who could use this ? Who would want to deploy this stuff in the field ? Liber8 . Exactly . One more thing . This whole inside man theory ? We discredited that . The evidence doesn 't match up . It does . If it 's not a man . We 're talking high-tech companies . Next level security . Real tight . But what else do they like ? Toys . Smart appliances . Thermostats . Refrigerators . Routers . Smart TVs . All Wi-Fi enabled and imminently hackable . Just like whoever pulled the Fermitas attacks . They 're listening all the time . Think about that next time you leave your computer on . I really hate the internet . [ Computer noises ] [ Phone ringing ] Hello Carlos . Lucas . Uh-huh . You behind these robberies ? Nope . But I can point you in the direction of who is . Yeah why don 't you do that . Then tell me what you want . That 's just it , Carlos . There 's no quid pro quo . This one 's a freebie . Yeah . Why should I trust you ? Because we both want Betty 's killer to go down . It 's worth taking a chance on trusting me . I miss what I left behind but somehow being here I 'm truer to myself . It clarified what I believe . I wonder about my other life . How it unfolds without me . I do the same thing . [ fighting grunts ] [ glass shatters ] [ fighting grunts ] Kiera ! Kiera . Are you okay ? Damnit . Hey . Look who 's back . Carlos . Are you okay ? How did you get here ? I called your phone and he answered . Told me what happened . I got here as soon as I could . [ phone rings ] Oh shit . Give me one second . Fonnegra . Who attacked you ? Somebody trying to finish a job they 'd already started . I don 't understand . Your leg ? It 's not bothering you anymore Yeah I know . I can 't explain it . Injected nanocells used for self-healing activated by adrenaline . Not uncommon in military personnel . One day . Hey , you good to travel ? Where to ? Greypoint Security . Gotta say , it 's actually nice to be here by invitation for a change . Let 's cut to the chase , shall we ? They grow up so fast . You already know why I asked you to come here . I assume the lawsuit jarred you out of your stubborn obliviousness . You don 't move in straight lines Kellogg . You never have . You say you want apples when you want oranges . You claim you want to sue me and pretend you want a pay day . I just want things to be fair . No you don 't . No , you maneuver . You 're maneuvering me . Question is , will it work or not ? I have no idea what you mean . I 've had my representatives tend you an offer for SadTech Inc. and all intellectual property including your exclusive services . Well that 's one way to get out of a lawsuit I suppose . Don 't pretend like this wasn 't your plan all along . Is that what I 'm doing ? Now you 're just being rude . Better be an offer I can 't refuse . Don 't tempt me . I want a seat on the Board . And I only report to you . As if anyone else would want to hear from you anyways . Fine . It 's good doing business with you . So Dillon told you to leave Betty 's murder alone , and you want to search Greypoint Securities without a warrant on the advice Liber8 . What can I say ; I 'm just in that kind of mood . You 've chosen sides , Carlos . Yeah I chose Betty 's side . Are you prepared to cross that line ? I am . You 're convinced Nealon 's working for Sonmanto . I 'm just following through . Okay . What 's the plan ? Betty said that Dillon would do the right thing if the facts were in front of him . I just need the facts . Is there anything that suit doesn 't do ? Holy shit . That 's the precinct . They hacked the cameras in the computers . Lucas said this would connect us to Betty ? The technology robberies . Hyper Stealth , Piron . You 're going to want to take a step back . Freeze ! Shit ! [ grunts ] Don 't move ! Where 's Nealon ? So how is our amateur thief ? Well he 's scared shitless but he 's cooperating . He says he can prove someone from Greypoint Security was behind the Fermitas gas attack . Well he 's smart . Unlike this asshole . We swept the precinct for bugs . We found just the one transmitter that hijacked everything within a 30 foot radius . Then there 's this . I ran ballistics on our friend 's gun and it matched the slug that killed Betty . Greypoint has disavowed you . They 're hanging you out . So if you want payback now 's your chance . Who put you up to it ? Lawyer . Resisting arrest . Understandable given your background . I 'm sorry , what was that you said ? Holy shit . Yeah no kidding . You scared me . Who am I ? Number 2 . Number 2 sit in the chair . Scan your wrist to accept the release . Extend your arm through the indicators and bite down on the sanitized bit . You are aware that Citizen Chip extraction renders your birth certification and Citizenship null and void ? Scan your wrist to accept the release . Scan your wrist to accept the release . CPS . This is an illegal business . CPS ! Don 't move ! Your Record ID is pristine doctor . Why sully it with this kind of back alley business ? Citizen Chips were a good idea once . Now they 're being abused by the corporate congress and people are wise to the scam that they unwittingly became a part of in the name of convenience . What 's legal and what 's right are not always the same thing . Cameron , make sure you book and process all these civilians also . Sir , these people that are waiting , they haven 't committed any crimes . Well , book them for intent . Book them all . Yes sir . What 's the problem Cameron ? It 's just that I never imagined someone would want to give up the benefits of Citizen Chip , identity . Back to work . Sync corrections by caioalbanezi Web-dl sync by claus68

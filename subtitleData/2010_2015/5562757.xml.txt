Can you turn that off " beloved " ? Take it up with mom . Where is she ? On the job . I thought she 's out of town today . Call her . Why was she going there ? The negotiating of Mimis contract . Nothing about regulated working ... Excuse me ? Mimi is to work like everyone else . It 's an ordinary lease . Everything is according to the standard . Standard ? Why does Claes have this hubot ? Her name is Mimi . Your hub ... Mimi does not need 8 hours of sleep . Then you can take advantage of her ? It does not matter . Now I 'm negotiating . Mimi should have the same benefits as others with equivalent information . Fine ! The same working hours and conditions . And five weeks of vacation . Do we agree then ? Do not look at me ! Do we agree ? We agree . I did not know it would take so long . We would only visit with some people . That 's what we do . Inger , Inger , come ! Bring Mimi too . I want to introduce my future daughter-in-law Florentine . I have a cold , so I will not shake your in hand . Congratulations ! Mimi - This is a new employee . Douglas . Mimi .

Nothing anyone says can stop me from that . You loved Leo . He was human . Leo was something else . Then I am in the same place . Can you not be happy for me ? You could ask first . We can ask her yourself . Ask what then ? My father has invited the entire office to the wedding . Then it becomes something grand . And maybe deductible . We want a small wedding and I will pay for it . You will not need to if we do it here . Can you help me ? It actually sounds fantastic . There you go ! Two against one . No woman wants to get married in secret . Lennart , you have to change clothes . Leave me alone ! I am your hubot . Odi is my hubot ! I 'm just trying to help you , Lennart . Stop talking to me , then ! You need to turn around ! It 's your clothes , Lennart . Mites and bacteria germinate in clothes . You have to wash them . What are you doing ? Can your Hubot leave me alone ? Inger wants him to change clothes . Will you change clothes ? Nah ! Lift up the arm . Why ? For me to turn you off . Do not touch me !

The bitch was put in her place . That language does not help us . What language ? Hubot huggers , bitch ... we want to raise constructive dialog . What makes Conny 's argument that good ? I do not know . Anyone ? He says it how it is . How are you thinking now ? I do not know ... Well , try ! But then ... he 's so right . She makes money from Hubots . Why should you trust her when she says that they are harmless ? Conny has the facts on his side . We are a important party . We have a philosophy . As good as Conny was , I want all of you to become . We start by saying things we are not against . Try to think in positive words ! Kevin ? We care about people . Good ! We 'll call it caring . More ? We are playing with our cards face up . When talking with a hubot , who knows what is programmed . Trust . Say what you want to say . Transparency . Security . Future . Humanity . Love .

Yes , and for my sister ... Flash . Is she dead ? No . She 's just lost . Should we not call a taxi anyway ? I do not drink , so I can drive . I still forget it . What 's this ? An old search . Do you like to see that kind of pictures ? No . I missed you . I was looking for a picture of you . She 's not me . I know . I did not have you . I had nothing . Now I have you . I did not know that the picture was still there . Throw it out ! Good . What is it ? Why do you not want a big wedding ? Are you ashamed of me ? Absolutely not . Like this : If we have a big wedding and you will be exposed ... I will lose you . You will not lose me and I will not lose you . We 'll live happily together just as in the stories . There 's something that we have to talk about . I do not understand . It was a shock for me too , but MRI scanning does not lie . I did not think you knew where you come from . I only know - That one of my parents had weakened carotid arteries . That I 've inherited . Can you just replace the part ? No . Why not ? We do not have that opportunity . That 's bad .

We 'll talk about that later , right ? Hello ! My name is Betty . What is your name ? Betty is just pretending to be hubot . How dull you are ! You blew it ! Anybody want anything from the bar ? They have Hubfluid in different colors . No thanks . I 'll have a green sparkly . Why pretend to be someone like us ? It 's just Betty . She is disturbed . Name ? ... what a little sweetie . It 's Mimi . Einar . This is my Lucinda . - You may want to see Mimi around . - Come on , Mimi . I 'll show you around . - Is that your girlfriend ? - Mimi ?

We will never die . We will rule . We are going to rule . WORK SOUNDS Tobias said you are working as a lawyer . That is correct . Is there software for that ? You , you do not need to be worried . All hubots here are modified . But you are ... so incredibly vivid . I 've never met anyone like you . One would think , that you are a person who pretends to ... I would never do that . I would like to look on your settings . What are you talking about ? Nothing . We are getting to know each other a bit . You know what ? Come with me . I want to show you something . But your brother , he is in love with Mimi ? Do not be disgusting ! She 's like a sister . All right . I just got that feeling . But it would not surprise me . Everyone loves Mimi . What ? What is it ? Sometimes it feels as if life were much easier if you were a hubot . Just download a program so you can speak Russian or flying a helicopter . You want to be a hubot ? Why didn 't you tell me right away ? I can do the baddest makeover on you . Please let me transform you ? Never . Skip it then ! What is it ? No ... We 'll go in instead . Do you live here ? Come and look at this ! It 's a program that I worked on . Right now it does nothing . But I hope it will free up hubots , as David Eischers code . Einar , I need to talk to you ! I do not like them . There is nothing wrong with them . Why , do they dress themselves like that ? It is mostly Betty . - That 's all . Even you . - This is like something I 've seen before . I want to go . - I 'm sorry , okay ? - It does not matter . - How clumsy I am ... - It does not matter . I 'm just kidding . - Should we call the police ? - No !

Calm down . Why doesn 't father care about grandpa ? He 's doing well ? He needs to just get used to it . Do you like that grandpa 's back ? Yes . Then we are two who enjoy it . I feel better about grandpa now . He smells better . You 're funny , you . But I do not like when Dad turns off him . His ... Honey , listen ! Do you recognize this ? Where 's Daddy ? Yeah , just ... I would like to talk to you about this . You should have seen how he behaved . Then we can talk about this . He does not listen to me . Have you tried with a nicer tone ? Does not matter . This is a machine. you click on them when you need them . Is it the same with Mimi ? She is not ... those . But it 's my dad ? Inger ... Why would he be like you say ? It is programmed into it . Why would they do that ? For it to resemble the original , maybe . There are too many hubots in the house . We 're getting rid of Vera . She 's the only one doing something ! What prevents you from helping ? Sorry , I did not mean that . But we 're talking about my ... Dad . If you had seen what I saw out there , you would have done exactly the same . Hello , Inger ! Hey , Dad . I love you . I know that . I have not been good at saying it ... You 've already told me . What was it that happened with Vera ? I do not like Vera . I love you , Inger . I 'm proud of you and all that you have accomplished . Can you see a difference between them ? No , that 's impossible . Okay , everyone human on that side of the room - and all hubots on that side . Well ... This will take time . All right . Human . Can you bend your ... ? Human . Bend your head . Hub Sec . Human . A human . Bend your head . Ouch ! Human . Human . Bend your head . Bend your head . Why ? Are you talking back to me ? Either you have dressed up or you 're ready for scrapping . Let her go ! Release him ! He has not done anything ! Drop ! What the hell ... ? Where did she go ? Where did she go ? Where did she go ? Huh ? ! Hans Engman . What ? Hello ! Hans Engman . I 'll pickup Tobias and Matilda Engman . Hello . Hello , hello . So ... Kevin . And you ? Tobbe . And ... Matilda . What , then , both ? Oh yes , so ... Oh , fuck ! Roger Larsson ! Thank you , thank you ! See you later . Mimi ! Mimi ! Mimi ! Stay here . I 'll be back soon . Who are you ? Inger Engman . Tobbes and Matilda 's mother . Sorry , what is this place ? We are Transhumaners . What is that ? Fighting for Hubot rights . But ... you dress like them ? I do not appreciate the tone you have . I do not appreciate that the police arrest my children - for assaulting a police officer ! I 'm just trying ... to understand . It 's not that complicated . We stand on the hubot side . But why should there be sides ? It 's no conflict . What do you think this looks like , then ? An open and tolerant society ? It will come to a head . Then you will be forced to take sides . This is grave robbing . You can not just dig up coffins . There is nothing like that . David burned up . There was nothing to bury . They buried David 's clone instead . The survivors desired that you , respect their wishes . I am David 's descendant . I am Beatrice Eischer . His son and his mother are dead . It is still grave robbing in all cases . What if a man was buried alive . It 's ... There is no man ? It would be wrong to dig up a coffin just because a relative has a hunch - even though there was a human . Gordon said you were different . I am a priest . This is my church . I have to stand up for it . I understand . But this is too important . No ! Bea ... stop . You promised ... you said that we would not hurt Asa . You promised . I have spoken to your mother . And ? She 's worried about you . Kev , dammit ! We want you to have a future . That 's why I do this . You used to believe in this . Yeah , sure , but ... they may reconsider . You have to be positive . I 'm positive . The future is positive . Consideration is positive , and compassion and trust . I decide what goes on here . So , that 's how it is . Well , no , so , then it is decided ! Have you nothing to say ? About what ? That Mimi almost ended up being recycled because of you . Matilda , this is serious ! You do not think I get it ? What is it ? Matilda ? You wouldn 't take me to town today . Something came up at work . With Mimi , or ? Yes . It feels like ... you think more about her than you like me . Why do you say that ? She is smart . I 'm just stupid . Matilda ? It feels like it . That you would rather have her be your daughter . How can you be jealous of Mimi ? Because she 's perfect . Mimi will never be a human . You are a human . Sorry . Did you bring me because I am a hubot ? I did not show you off . I just wanted to do something with you because I like you . Because you 're you . You have to go now . But ... I want you to go now . I am a child of David ... " Fear not . , I know you seek Jesus , which was crucified . " " He is not here ; for he is risen . " I am a child of David . We will never die . We are going to rule . It is really a clone . He needs electricity . Why won 't he ... ? Someone has taken out the brain . Hi , I want to have ownership information on a company : Eischer Transhumanology . I have the registration number here : 593185-9303 . Thank you ! Drive me home . Hello , Einar . It is Tobias . I have a small question only . If one were to find David Eischers code , how would you recognize it ? Okay ...

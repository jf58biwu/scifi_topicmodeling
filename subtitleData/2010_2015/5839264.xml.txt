 Hi . Is there a problem ? Jack Benson was a friend of mine . I 'm ... I 'm so sorry . You were the one in charge , right ? Some kind of manager ? Uh , he ... He was my friend , too . Jack 's wife said it was your fault . That true ? You know what ? Um , never mind . I think I 'm just gonna go somewhere else . Hey ! I asked you a question . Stay away from me . Oh ! What the hell ? You did that ? No , I ... I swear . Get away from me ! No . Lord , please . Not again . We have a mission . Any specifics ? No . Well , we should follow the same plan as before . Take separate routes back , stagger our timing , so no one suspects ... Wait , a telekinetic ? I thought they didn 't exist . We 've never verified one . That 's why we 're going to Batesville . To conduct an Index Asset Evaluation and Intake . Does that mean we talk to her and see if she has powers ? Basically . Well , that needs a better name . Less IRS , more better . Something like " The Welcome Wagon . " I want you to pay close attention on this one , Skye . It 's an opportunity to learn how to deal with someone with newfound abilities . It 's not like I 've never done this before . I found Mike Peterson before you did . Remember how that went ? This is your chance to see how it 's done when it 's done right . How many people like this have you encountered ? A handful . There 's not that many people on the Index . They must wig out when they see the S.H.I.E.L.D. trucks roll up . Each case is different . Some people are in complete denial that there 's anything 's unusual about them . It 's a delicate process . And from our reports , this sounds like a particularly sensitive situation . " Particle Accelerator Explodes . " Hannah Hutchins , one of the Quality Control engineers . " Was it her fault ? The town blames her . Four technicians died in that blast on her watch . It 's terrible . All those families . Small church community . They 're pretty rattled . She must be , too . Friends , coworkers dead , and on top of all that , she might have some crazy power she can 't understand . Or control . Sir . The Department of Energy 's declared the particle acceleration lab too dangerous to enter . But the good news is we still think we can retrieve the disaster event data from the instruments . We 'll determine the cause and see if there 's any correlation between telekinesis spontaneously forming and a particle accelerator exploding . Well , it does use giant magnets to fire billions of subatomic particles into their anti-particles at the speed of light to create miniature Big Bangs , so it seems like a good place to start . I read . I 'll try not to mention Big Bangs when we talk to Hutchins about the explosion . You 'll stay in the car . This is a delicate situation . We don 't know what kind of danger this woman poses , so I 'll make initial contact with Agents Ward and May . Wheels up in five . Better strap in . It 's a delicate situation , so you 're bringing along Warm and Fuzzy ? - Hey , guys . - You 're late . We know what you did ! She blew up that gas station . Why aren 't you arresting her ? Officer , is there anything you could do to get these people to disperse ? Been trying , but it 's a free country . Ms. Hutchins , I 'm Agent Coulson . We specialize in strange occurrences like the ones you 've encountered . You 've come to lock me up ? To talk . Well , what good will that do ? - Get out of here ! - We don 't want you here anymore ! Officers , get those people back . Murderer ! Move it ! Move out of the way ! Go ! It 's her ! That freak just tried to kill us ! Hey ! Calm down . Easy , Officer . Put the gun down . Leave me alone ! - Ms. Hutchins , please calm down . - It wasn 't me ! Please calm down . We 're not gonna let anyone hurt you . Time to go . So much for the Welcome Wagon . We don 't believe that people have telekinetic powers , do we ? Well , May was forced to sedate her . The woman made a police car move with her mind . There 's no principle that would support ... Telekinesis . Not yet . We did believe for a bit though , remember ? Freshman year ? When Sally Webber made the books fall off the table in neurobiology . Oh , well , that was a particularly cruel prank . You screamed like a girl . I am a girl . You know , that 's the one drawback of graduating three years early . We never got to pull any freshman pranks on anyone else . Mm . Fitz . Skye never went to the Academy . She 's a freshman . A wide-eyed little freshman . And being pranked is an integral part of becoming a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent . Well , mandatory , really . Why not give her the full S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy experience ? It would be unjust to deny her such a thing . Information data uploaded . Let 's get going . Yes , sir . Just a mattress , sir ? It 's a six-hour long ride to the Fridge . Fitz added magnetic shielding to the Cage after Simmons had her scare . If Ms. Hutchins has this power , then that room should keep it from getting out . But in there , she 'll be just as dangerous . How is she ? The dendrotoxin 's wearing off . She 'll be awake soon , scared , in a strange room . Our next interaction with her is crucial to gaining her trust . Which is why I want you there . Are you sure that 's a good idea ? If Ms. Hutchins is going to believe anything we say , she needs to know we 're not hiding things from her . Which means you explaining the situation . What if that doesn 't calm her down ? What if that makes her more agitated ? Then he definitely wants me in there . Pretty much . I 'll observe from out here . And I 'll lose the tie . If she is telekinetic , I don 't want to have a noose around my neck . Brought you some water . It 's okay . I 'm Phil . This is Melinda May . How did I get here ? I sedated you . I apologize for bringing you in that way . Things were escalating . It was for everyone 's safety . Everyone 's safety . Good . Okay . Oh , lord , what have I done ? I promise you , Ms. Hutchins , nobody was hurt back there . Wherever I go , things turn bad . Were you angry at those people ? Back at the house ? Um , angry ? No . I know most of them . They were angry . I understand . Oh , God . Frank 's wife . The way she was looking at me . Frank Delacort . He died in the accident . Because of me , they 're gone . I killed them . So sad . And normal . These readings are entirely within average ranges . Of course , it 's hard to find something when you don 't know what you 're looking for . All I can tell from these brain waves is she 's upset . You need a computer for that ? May 's in there . The woman who shot her . Sedated her . Things got out of hand . May sorted it out . - She 's The Cavalry . - Mm . Where does that name come from anyway ? - You don 't know ? - Didn 't Ward tell you ? 'Course not , you spent no time at the Academy . It 's quite a story . Yeah , well , Ward isn 't exactly a chatty S.O. Well , imagine if you will ... A heavily secured compound . Manama , Bahrain . Multiple S.H.I.E.L.D. agents are taken hostage . Tortured for information . May 's mission , eliminate the threat . You mean , kill people . Not people . Entire squads of mercenaries . Almost 100 . More than 100 . More than 100 men . Heavily armed . Her vehicle got totaled , so she rode in ... And , um , she had an M249 in each hand . Right . In each hand . And she rode in on a horse . Hence the name . The Cavalry . Is this real ? She eliminated the enemy threat single-handedly . She saw a lot of hurt that day . Is that why she 's so ... Happy ? Particle accelerator data loading . No ! - You do not touch that ! - Ugh ! Two semesters minimum of holographic engineering before you get to touch this ! All right ! All right ! I get it . I didn 't go to your stupid S.H.I.E.L.D. Hogwarts , or whatever . I 'm gonna go upstairs and I 'm gonna do my own research . On my computer . My boring , old , flat computer . Can you believe she bought that ? A horse . Brilliant . You thinking of the next prank ? We must carry on the tradition . Yeah . For weeks , I was getting reports from Section 2 , complaining that the coupling assembly was coming loose at the bolts . Tobias is the ... He was the technician down there . He replaced the part and we triple checked it for damage . Seems like I went down there every few days . - Did you find a problem ? - No . But , clearly , I missed something . My team is working to determine what really did happen . And what might have happened to you . To me ? What do you mean ? We believe , that somehow , as a result of the accident , you acquired some form of telekinetic ability . You think it 's me ? The police car ? The gas ... You think I did that ? We 're not sure , and this can be a hard thing to hear , but all these events have one thing in common . Me . But I 'm not causing it . It 's not me . I wish it were , because then maybe I could make it stop . But if it 's not you , then what is it ? You people won 't believe me . Try me . God 's punishing me . He abandoned me . He doesn 't protect me anymore . That 's why this is happening . Protect you from what ? Demons , sir . I 'm being haunted by demons . Delusions of being persecuted aren 't uncommon after trauma . She 's certainly been through her fair share . She 's blaming herself . It 's guilt . It 's all of it . She 's broken . Pore over the accident site . If that tragedy gave her powers , we need to shut them down . If it wasn 't her fault , even better . But until then , she 's a danger to all of us . Just let me go in and talk to her , sir . As a friend . I can 't let you do that . It 's too dangerous . She 's not dangerous , she 's nice . Like , overly nice . She never misses a birthday post to her friends . Runs the youth program at her church . Rescues dogs . Hannah 's a safety inspector not just because she 's detail-oriented , but because she ... - She genuinely cares . - Right . And someone with that much empathy being responsible for that much loss of life ? She 's devastated . Spouting nonsense about God punishing her ... People believe what they need to believe to justify their actions . Is that how you justify your shoot-first policy ? At least let me try to repair that damage . Until we figure out what 's going on with her , she stays locked up , and you stay away . I thought that was glued down . You 're asking the right questions , Skye , but for now , that 's all you get to do . I 'm sorry . I just don 't understand her at all . Everything to her is just , " Target acquired . Threat eliminated . " Well , she 's a specialist . In one thing . You can catch a lot more flies with honey than with napalm . Just saying . Hand me the lettuce ? And she says I need to stay away , but you know what I think ? I think she needs to get laid . Might want to be less confrontational with Agent May . I 'm not scared of her . Well , I am , but just because The Cavalry shot 100 guys on horseback doesn 't mean she knows how people work . Horseback ? - Where 'd you hear that ? - Fitz-Simmons . Were they messing with you ? The story gets bigger every year . It wasn 't 100 guys . It was 20 . Trained assassins . May crossed them off with one pistol , no support . She rescued a bunch of agents ? Mm-hmm . There definitely wasn 't a horse . Well , if it went so well , why is she so squirrelly about the name ? Well , May 's not in it for the glory . She got the job done . End of story . What did I do with that knife ? Leave me alone ! Oh , God . Please forgive me . Ah , this must be the coupling from the reports . Oh , dear . The technicians were right . Were you even listening ? You weren 't even a wee bit scared ? More disappointed , really . It 's fine . It 's fine . I 'm just work-shopping here . And , yes , I was listening . I was about to go fetch our old magnetic couplings to run simulations . Oh , well , while you 're in there , grab some more diazepam for Hannah . She may need to be more heavily sedated . And the prank needs more work as well . I know . I 'm trying different things . It 's the timing that matters , Simmons . Skye can 't suspect a thing . Ward . Come look at this . Tobias Ford . Oh , isn 't he one of the technicians who died at the plant ? Yeah . And he filed three safety complaints in the past month . Each one in Hannah 's department . She thought he was her friend , but he had it out for her . The sad part is he was right . Oh , couplings . Couplings , couplings . Yes . That 'll do , actually . Oh . Now this I could use . All I need now is a little bit of twine . And an unsuspecting victim . Oh , that 's fantastic , that is . Well , that 's Odd . My God . Fitz , look at this . What are we seeing here ? It 's as if the explosion tore open some sort of window to ... - To hell ! - Aah ! Simmons , are you okay ? Sir . Hannah 's telling the truth . She 's not telekinetic . There 's someone else on this plane . - What was that ? - The plane 's lost power . We 're going down . Ward , you certified ? What about engine-driven generators ? Those are dead , too . Switch batteries to maintain flight controls . The rest will be needed to keep the Cage shielded . Flaps 10 . Lower landing gear . - What can I do ? - Buckle up . There 's a decent size field up ahead , but it 's gonna be rough . Vertical landing 's out . - Coming in a little hot . - I got it . Our ear comms are usually relayed through the plane , so here 's some hardware . Did the girl do this to us , sir ? We believe Ms. Hutchins is the victim here . Our theories about her powers have been disproved . - By who ? - I saw a ghost . I ... I know how it sounds , but a man attacked me and then he disappeared . Did you get a good look at him ? He dematerialized ! May , run your systems checks . Is the Cage still shielded ? Most of the power 's dedicated to it . This man , or whatever he is , has been tormenting Ms. Hutchins . The Cage might be the one thing protecting her now . - We 'll inform her . - Sir . Can it be me to talk to Hannah ? Her life has been turned upside down and we stuck her in a nightmare box . She thinks she 's being punished . Can I please be the one to deliver the good news ? That a non-corporeal madman is hunting her ? Again , I think it 'd be better coming from anyone else really . All right . I 'll head upstairs , activate the emergency transceiver and radio HQ . Ward , take a firearm . Escort Fitz-Simmons downstairs , assess the damage , get us up and running ... Wait . Guys , um , where 's Fitz ? Hello ? Can anybody hear me ? What the hell 's happening ? Did we crash ? Who was screaming ? This is not funny , Jemma . If this is a prank . This is a prank . Clever . Simmons ? Come on , turn on the lights . Thank God ! Where have you been ? I have been locked in a closet , freaking out , thanks to you two geniuses . That wasn 't us . Well , then who was it ? We found Fitz . Good , we 'll need him . Looks like the main problem is in avionics bay two . - He took out all systems . - Who 's she talking about ? Grab your equipment and get in there . I 'm gonna power-down flight controls to conserve energy and then go defend the Cage door . In case this ghost comes knocking . Did she just say " ghost " ? Mayday , mayday . Region North , this is S.H.I.E.L.D. 6-1-6 . We 've lost electrical and are grounded . Calculating coordinates . Requesting support ... 1990s technology at its best . Hannah ? Who 's there ? My name is Skye . We haven 't met yet . We crashed , didn 't we ? Are you all hurt ? I 'm so sorry . No . No , no , we 're okay . Whatever 's happening , it 's not your fault . We were wrong . But you need to stay in that room so that you 're safe . Something bad is out here . Demons . I don 't know what it is . Do you believe in God ? Honestly ? Not really . Well , I do . And I know that he 's punishing me . And I deserve it . No . No , you don 't . No one does . I had a few nuns around me growing up and they would talk like that . Scaring kids with stories of God 's wrath . It made me not want to believe . The only words that stuck with me were something Sister McKenna said , from the Bible , I think . She said , " God is love . " It 's simple and it 's a little sappy , but that 's the version I like . " God is love . " The thing that holds us together . And if that 's true , I don 't think he would punish you for making a mistake . I think he 'd forgive a mistake . I want to believe that , I do . I 'll stand guard now . Coulson needs help with the emergency transceiver . I would rather stay here for a while ... It needs to get done , not discussed . That 's an order . I 'll be nearby if you need me , okay ? Try not to hurt her any more than you already have , Agent May . He thinks it 's hell , but I think it 's an alien world . Fitz , it was stunning . Well , there were reports in London after the spaceship landed of multiple portals opening . Thor passing between worlds . You think that 's what they were researching at that lab ? Trying to create another portal , yes . Failing , until a malfunction produced a burst of energy . This ghost is a man trapped between our universe and another . Perhaps that 's how all ghosts are . It 's a simple explanation , really . Simple would be a relative term in this case . Bloody hell . He was thorough . on , God . The plane 's on uneven ground , could just be settling . Or the other thing . Get to work . Clear . Ward , help ! Quiet . on ! Help ! Seems like a hardware issue , not firmware . I should be with Hannah anyway . No wonder she keeps screaming in there . You keep sending in The Cavalry , you 're bound to get a reaction like that . Don 't call her that . Why not ? No normal person can shoot 100 Bahraini ... That 's not how it went down . Whatever , 20 . I don 't ... She didn 't have a gun . None of us did . And it wasn 't a rescue , or an assault , whatever they say at the Academy these days . We were the Welcome Wagon . And it went south . - How many ... - Plenty . A civilian girl and a few of our guys were stuck inside a building being held by the followers of this gifted individual . Or worshippers . We never found out . May did . She took it upon herself to get them out . Said she could fix the problem . So she went in , crossed off the enemy force . Didn 't say how . Did she lose anyone in there ? Herself . May used to be different . She was always quiet , she just ... She was warm . Fearless in a different way . Getting in trouble , pulling pranks . Thought rules were meant to be broken . Sound familiar ? But when she walked out of that building , it was like that part of her was gone . I tried to comfort her , but she wouldn 't tell me what went down in there . What did you say ? I said the words I thought she needed to hear . That 's why you want her on the plane . To see if that person is still in there somewhere . The lock is jammed . Let me in or let her out . - That 's not up to us . - Let her out ! Talk to me . What 's happening ? May , he 's disappearing . He 's passing between worlds . It seems a little less of him is returning every time he appears . But why is he after you guys ? Because he can 't get to Hannah in there . She 's safe . If we wait it out , maybe he 'll disappear fully . What are you going to do ? Fix the problem . We gotta find a way out of here . Any of this crap still work ? There he is . What happened ? Well , we lost communication . And you were hit with a very large plumber 's wrench . - A wrench ? - Yeah . That guy 's traveling back and forth between alien worlds with a wrench ? Must have been in his hand when the blast hit . Not the kind of wrench you would use to loosen a coupling , is it ? ... there ? Maybe it doesn 't work after all . Uh , yes , yes , we 're here , sir . Where did you go ? Nowhere . We were attacked . Locked in . Then the guy disappeared . Hey , that 's our story . - Is May with you guys ? - She isn 't with you ? I don 't mean to scare you . I just need to use you as bait . Well , that 's comforting . To draw him out , away from my people . Then what will you do ? Whatever I have to . And you 're sure this is how to do it ? Yes , I 'll max the signal and the transceiver will act as a trigger . Okay , fine . They only made 20 I think . Oh . So we believe that this man is responsible for the blast ? Skye said she thinks he 's the worker who filed all the reports . Tobias Ford . It looks like him . it makes no sense for a man to complain about safety issues whilst causing them . Another theory is ... Theories don 't matter . Only facts . And the fact is , a bullet will take you out of whatever world you 're in . Any idea which direction May could have taken her ? We 'll deploy the Golden Retrievers . They 're in here . Fitz ! This is no time for childish nonsense like this ! Pranking was your idea . And obviously , I rigged this little beauty before I knew there was a dimension-jumping psychopath in the mix . Wait , Childish . This guy is childish . What are you getting at ? Tobias . Is that you ? He wanted her to notice him . Why would he file a complaint to her office when there was nothing wrong and then cause an actual safety issue himself ? To get her fired ? To get her attention . To spend time with her . Think about it . He scared the guy who was harassing her at the gas station . He tried to hit you with a cop car . When we took her into custody . Yeah , he 's not trying to hurt her . He 's trying to protect her . He likes her . Stay here . It 's okay . It 's okay . Tell him I won 't hurt you . Tobias , wait . She 's a friend . Hannah . You have to stop . Please . Listen . We believe you 're trapped between two worlds . - This world ... - And hell ! I 'm being dragged to hell for what I did . What did you do ? Just loosen a few bolts and then you 'd visit . It was the best part of my day . I 'm sorry , I ... I didn 't mean for anyone to get hurt . Oh , no . Tobias . - How could you ? - I killed them . I know . And even worse , everyone started blaming you . - I tried to stop them ... - But you hurt more people . I was trying to protect you from them . I was trying to atone for my sin . Hannah , please . Maybe if you forgive me , I won 't go to hell . Only God can forgive you . And he won 't . You can 't undo what 's been done . That will be with you forever . But trying to hold on to this life , clinging to the person you thought you could be ? That 's hell . And you 're dragging her down with you . You have to let go . Before my people come and make you do it . If you care about her , and I know you do , let her go . Let the girl go , Tobias . Let the girl go . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . Let 's go out . It 's over . What did you say to him ? Same words you said to me in Bahrain . Is she all right ? Much better . Let me know if she needs anything . - Can Fitz repair it ? - No . This one 's a lost cause . But May isn 't . If anyone can bring her around , it 's you . You know what makes people tick . Pun intended . So do you . You see the good in them . You were a friend to Hannah , you can 't wait to get inside May 's head , and you figured out Tobias without even trying . Guess I 'm full of surprises . But this isn 't one of them . I wanted you paying close attention to the Index Asset Evaluation and Intake process , because someday , you 'll be really good at it . Even the best . Thanks , A.C. Maybe you 'll get to rename it . Good , ' cause that name is super stupid . I know . Mind if I keep you company ? Cool . " Ya-den ! That isn 't a word in our language . - I 've never heard of it . - I 'm checking . " Our language " ? You mean , the English language first spoken in England ? " Aglet . A plastic or metal tube covering the end of a shoelace . " Oh , come on . She used her Britishness against us . It 's a word . It 's not funny . I was sleeping peacefully . - Very clever , Simmons . - I didn 't do it . Well , Ward . I don 't appreciate ... Don 't look at me ! - Okay , well , Skye . - No . Well , who then ? Look , the bunks should be off limits , okay ? - Don 't laugh ! Because I know it was one of you .

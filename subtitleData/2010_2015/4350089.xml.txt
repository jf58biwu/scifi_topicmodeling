 [ Wedeck ] On October 6th , the planet blacked out for two minutes and 17 seconds . The whole world saw the future . In my flash forward , I was in my office . It was 10 : 00 , on the hour , and I happened to see the date . April 29 , 2010 . Oh , my God . This is it . We 're here . - How 's it going ? - Struggling with the decoherence equation . - The equation . Yeah , you do the math . You do the numbers together . You 're both part of the equation . - What 's your name ? - Keiko . [ Woman ] We have a shift down at lmmigration tonight . - I have something I have to tell you . - Yeah , me , too . We 're here , now . This is all that matters . - I want to be a part of this baby . - You don 't have to do anything . What if I don 't wanna walk away ? I 'm gonna be on this plane tomorrow . I 'm hoping you will be , too . I ran this gait analysis on Simon Campos and on Suspect Zero . Simon Campos is Suspect Zero . - Who 's Hellinger ? - [ Lita ] Hellinger 's our boss . Face down ! On the floor ! Simon Campos ! Is he here ? No . Janis . I need your help . [ Charlie ] Mommy ! Mommy ! - [ Crying ] - Sweetie . Oh . It 's OK . Deep breaths . - You 're OK . You 're OK . - [ Breathing fast ] - What happened ? - I had a bad dream . You did ? It 's OK . Today 's the day . Oh . Yeah . Yeah . But you know what ? It 's gonna be all right . I 'm right here . Today 's the day Daddy 's gonna die . [ Simon ] You worked with my security detail . So , you know what will happen when everyone finds out that the mad scientist was awake when the rest of the world was asleep . - I 'll be a dead man . - What do you want , Simon ? I want revenge . I want to destroy the people who were really responsible for the global blackout . Look . They 're cornered now . We have Hellinger in custody . You , of all people , must know it goes beyond one person . - I want to get back at them . - And who are they ? I don 't know . They had me install a piece of software into the mainframe to make the accelerator fire on October 6th . We 've been over that system a thousand times and we didn 't find anything . Well , I designed it . I 'll find something other people won 't . Let me bring you to the Bureau , Simon . We can help you . I can 't do this with the FBI . I can 't do this with the CIA contacts . Those people won 't let me anywhere near the mainframe again . Look ... you get me into NLAP , I 'll turn myself in . Why did you start working for these people in the first place ? I was a kid . Told me I was destined for greatness . I believed them . That was a marathon night , but we did it . We got Hellinger . Yeah , we did it . It 's not the end , though . I got a full morning with the digital forensics guys . No , you don 't . You got a flight to catch . - Here . - What the hell 's this ? That , my friend , is 15 covers of Islands In The Stream . [ Chuckles ] There 's My Morning Jacket , Feist , The Constantines , some band from Croatia ... - When the hell did you make this ? - Yeah , I don 't get much sleep . You 're alive . In the future you saw , you weren 't . Go to Hawaii . Go be alive . You kidding me ? It 's D-Day . We need all hands on deck . No . The place is packed with CIA , FBI , NSA . - We 're covered . Go . - Mark ... Pick a version you like , dance with your bride . - What 's up ? - Nothing . Everyone gets cold feet , Dem . It 's not cold feet . - Don 't you love her ? - Come on . Do you want to marry her ? Hell yes . So what 's stopping you ? You know , even with the way everything went down ... Even though I lost her ... Marrying Olivia was the best thing I ever did . Don 't be afraid . Especially on a day like this . [ Telephone ringing ] You 'll stay home from school today with me , sweetie . - Hello . - [ Lloyd ] Hey , it 's me , Lloyd . - Hey , Lloyd . Can I call you back ? - No , there 's no need . I was just ... - I wanted to talk about tonight . - You know ... I really can 't think about that right now . Is everything OK ? Charlie 's having a really hard time . Well , yeah . You know , I 'd really like us to be together . Can I ... I 'll call you back , OK ? Sweetie . Where 's Demetri ? He 's taking care of something else . What do we got ? Hellinger invested big in dot-coms in the early 90s , then dumped them before the crash . He put those earnings into real estate . - Got out at the height of the market ? - Every transaction . - He bought low , sold high . - Future-casting . Yeah , listen , they used the flash forwards to determine the outcome of a particular event , then put money on a sure thing . Was this the bigger conspiracy you were talking about in Hong Kong ? Because it sounds like Econ 101 . Imagine how you could use this technology to manipulate geopolitics . NSA just finished up with Hellinger . It 's been eight hours and he just said his first six words . " I 'm only speaking to Mark Benford . " Finally . We need to talk . Did you cause the global blackout ? We have something more pressing that has to do with you . Did you cause the global blackout ? Yes . I caused the blackout , but that really doesn 't matter now . - We can 't change that . - How 'd you do it ? I 've seen today more times than I can remember . And a lot of those days started with me sitting right here with you . May I ? - This ? - Please . Thank you . There are so many possibilities . Different paths this day could take . I have seen so many different versions of this moment . And the next one . And the next one . But in every version of the future I saw ... I saw this . In this room , you will lose control , and then you 'll lose everything . You 're going to attack me , Mark . Because you realize you will never get the answers to your questions . And then , at the end of it all , you 'll be killed in your office . When 's the next blackout ? I 've seen how this goes , Mark . If you keep me in custody , you will die . I 'm sorry . You drew me a picture and now you want me to let you go ? I know . It seems self-serving . But , please , you have to believe me . This ... This is your life . Tell me how you did it and how to stop it from happening again . If you 're not interested in saving your life , I don 't have much to say to you . That 's all right . You just told me what your next move is . Mind if I take this ? We 're kicking civilians out at noon . I was just packing up my stuff so I could carry on working at home . Can I help you with something ? That symbol . What is it ? The tachyon constant . A theoretical number physicists have been trying to crack for centuries . Sort of a Holy Grail thing . It was on these blueprints that Dyson Frost was carrying . It was in the formula in my flash forward . At 10 : 00 , I 'm supposed to be on the verge of cracking something monumental . That would certainly qualify . I don 't know if this will help , but there it is again . Hellinger drew this . He included that symbol as something his side is going to do today . I wanna beat them to the punch . So , what the hell is a tachyon wipe ? Nothing . It doesn 't make any sense . A tachyon is a particle . You can 't wipe it . I mean , you literally can 't even touch it . [ Doorbell rings ] - Hey . - Hey . Happy Flash Forward day . I know you love these . They 're for you . Thanks . I was just thinking about you . - Liar . - Seriously . Check it out . So , I haven 't planned out everything for tonight , but I thought maybe we could start with some water polo . We could bob for apples . Maybe finish off with some scuba diving . Uh , yeah , Keiko . Are you sure that you 're OK with tonight ? With us ? So the sweet , sexy woman that brings me cupcakes is worried about a pretend girl who lives half a world away ? Come on . [ Woman speaking Japanese ] [ Gasps ] [ Woman ] Attention travelers , you are not required to give money to solicitors . The airport does not sponsor their activities . Hi . [ Sighs happily ] Baby ... I knew you 'd come . Oh , my God . [ Chuckles ] So my parents are already at the hotel . They said that there 's a hot tub in the room . You remember the last time we had a hot tub in the room ? - Yeah . - You ready ? Um ... - Can I talk to you for a minute ? - Yeah . OK . - [ Clears throat ] - What 's up ? I love you . And I should have told you this a long time ago . In Janis ' vision , she was ... pregnant . For that to come true , it had to happen while she was in Somalia . OK . I slept with Janis so she could get pregnant . - What ? - I know that was wrong . I just ... The future was happening , you know , I ... My life was ending , another life was beginning . I know it sounds crazy , but ... I thought I was gonna die , and it made sense at the time . [ Murmurs ] Everything that I 've been doing , Dem ... All the lines that I 've crossed , the ... I did everything for you . I did everything I could . It was because I believed that ... I believed that you were gonna live and that we were gonna spend the rest of our lives together . Obviously , you didn 't . I am so sorry . I 'm so sorry . I just thought that our life together was over on March 15th , that 's what I thought . I was wrong . You were right . You believed that we can change the future . But I want to start over . I wanna marry you . Please marry me . Please . Um ... I 'm gonna ... I 'm gonna go to Hawaii with my parents . And I don 't want you to come , Dem . And after that I don 't know . [ Aaron ] Don 't worry , Tracy , we made it . This is where we were in our flash forward . [ Weakly ] I was in a cave . Jericho brought me here . - Honey , don 't worry . Don 't talk . - She needs a hospital . I 'm not sure I can care for her here . Her pulse is thready . They made me tell them . Tracy , we know what we saw . You 're going to be fine , all right ? [ Coughing ] Tracy ? Khamir . Tracy ? Tracy ? Tracy ? I cross-referenced Hellinger 's financial documents with the word " tachyon " . Tachyon Offsite Information Systems . Their office is in Arcadia . Do you think that 's what Hellinger meant by a " tachyon wipe " ? They warehouse data . Maybe you can 't wipe a tachyon , but data 's a whole other story . I 'm going in with a team . Mark ... Are you sure that 's a good idea ? Going after the bad guys ? Yeah . Think about it . Hellinger helps organize a worldwide blackout . You really believe he 'd be sloppy enough to leave you a clue like this ? Maybe . People make mistakes . Forget it . - What ? - You heard me . You 're staying . You stay on Hellinger , I 'll send a special ops unit to check it out . No , you can 't do that . I can . You 're staying . I 'm not letting you walk into a trap . - She 's barely moving air . - Tracy . - Breathe , Tracy ! Breathe ! - Please ! No , stop . Aaron , please , let me work . Please . You ! What the hell did you and your Jericho buddies do to her ? [ Man gasps ] You 're going to tell me why Jericho came after my daughter . I 'm just an independent contractor on a security ... [ groans ] She saw you guys killing an entire village . I don 't know what you 're talking about . You 're gonna tell me why , now . We weren 't killing them . She saw an entire village full of people passed out on the ground . It was an experiment . A test run . For what ? [ Groans ] Keep talking . The experiment 's radius was one kilometer . We needed to know why she was awake . Experiment for what ? - For what ? - For the global blackout . [ Simon ] I hope the CIA gives you an expense account . We 're gonna stop by a hardware store , pick up supplies on the way to NLAP . Breaking into a linear accelerator , we 're going to need more than duct tape . Not that kind of hardware . Dem ? What 's going on here , Janis ? What is he doing here ? - Tell him to put down his weapon . - What 's he doing here , Janis ? He 's making a deal . You were bringing him to NLAP , planning to let him touch that accelerator ? He can give us more information than anyone else can . In the meantime , you risk him using that machine to put the world to sleep again . I didn 't use it the first time . I 'm not going to this time , either . Hey , hey . Dem ... This is about nailing the people behind the blackout . This about getting the job done the best way I know how . Janis , come on . You got more to worry about than just doing a good job . OK . Dem . I just need you to pretend like you never came by . Just let me do this . No . [ Both gasp ] You 're gonna regret this decision for the rest of your life . [ Breathing heavy ] [ Man ] We 've secured the Tachyon Data Center . All we 've got is a room full of servers . Has the data been wiped ? No . It 's weird . I 'm getting nothing . Just a blinking cursor . [ Clattering over speaker ] What the hell was that ? I don 't know . It sounded like it was coming from the storeroom . - I thought you swept the place . - We did . I 'm gonna go check it out . We 're getting thermal readings back now . No , get out of there . Get out of there , agent ! Whoa ! Heads up . Movement on your ... - [ gunfire , screaming over speaker ] - Watch out , nine o 'clock ! [ Gunfire , screaming continues ] Get out of there ! [ Silence over speaker ] Mark , wait . Whoa , what 's going on ? They opened fire on three of our guys . You were right . Tachyon was a trap . - Whoa . Cool down . Cool down . - No , I gotta go talk to ... Don 't worry . I got this . - I got this . - [ Charlie ] Daddy ! Hey , sweetie . - You OK ? - Yeah . Hey , Stan . - Are you ? - Yeah . It 's been a slow day . Babe , you wanna go wait in Daddy 's office ? I 'm really sorry to bring her here like this . She 's scared . I think the reality of today and everything that 's happened , I think it 's really hitting her . She just needed her dad . I really did not know what else to do . I 'm glad you brought her over . Hey , Charlie-bear . Charlie . What 's up ? I don 't want you to die . Come here . I need to ask you to do something for me . Something really , really hard . Don 't be afraid . I mean , it 's OK to be afraid . It is . But that 's just what happens at first . After that , you have to tell yourself something . " My daddy loves me . And everything will be OK , no matter what . " - My daddy loves me . - So much . And everything will be OK , no matter what . It 's not easy , 'cause things can be scary , bigger than us . We can fight it . That 's what I do . I tell myself , " Charlie loves me , and everything will be OK , no matter what . " - You do ? - I do . I tell myself that and it makes me strong . It makes me brave . 'Cause when I say that you 're always with me . And when I say it ? I 'm always with you . Always . I love you so much , baby girl . I love you with everything I 've got . Oh . Thanks , honey . OK . You go and be with Mom , OK ? You go ahead now . - [ Simon ] You 're making a big mistake . - [ Demetri ] Shut up . Janis , this guy has been lying to us about everything . He was working for them . He was awake during the blackout . How the hell do you trust this guy ? After all the lying , I think I 've realized that you get to a point where you can 't do it anymore . - You coming with me ? - To the FBI ? - Yeah . - No . Tell them where you found him . Don 't lie for me . This NLAP thing is totally insane , you know that ? Yeah , I know that . If I hadn 't have shown up , you would have gone through with this ? Yeah . Get in . No , Dylan , Dylan , watch out . I am watching . No , it 's a figure of speech . I mean , be careful . Somewhere in here is the answer to a very big question . Why did the eight die ? What ? Why did the eight die ? Oh , no , no , that 's ... That 's not an eight . That 's infinity . - What 's infinity ? - Oh , well , infinity means forever . But you 're right , it does kind of look like an eight on its side . All the ones with numbers have to be together . No , Dylan , just , please leave those there . It all has to be in the right place . What did you say ? It all has to be in the right place . [ Gabriel ] Do the numbers . You do the numbers together . And then you 're both part of the equation . OK , Dylan , Dylan , Dylan . Go and get your coat . Go now . Go , go , go . [ Door opening ] I hope your agents are all right . In most futures , they survive . When 's the next blackout ? I don 't know if you 're in a place where you can hear this , and I don 't want to say " I told you so , " but I gave you a choice , Mark . I asked you a question . When is the next blackout ? I gave you a choice and you chose the wrong path . I 'm sorry the way this is turning out . I mean it , but there is nothing you can do - to turn this back around . - Shut up ! When is it ? You 're going to die , Mark . And I take no pleasure in that . I really don 't . I had so many conversations with you in this very room . You 're a decent man . This is just all over your head . When is the next blackout ? Mark , you work hard . You 're passionate about what you do . But don 't you see ? All of this is just so futile . All of it . All of it ? We caught you . Your faith is admirable . I mean , that board in your office . How much time have you spent on that thing ? How much time have you spent just looking at it ? All on faith . But you 've got to know what that board really is . Tell me . What is that board about ? It 's nothing but a scrapbook of your failures . Tell me when the next blackout is . A freed Nazi , a botched mission to Somalia , - some monster paintings , dead birds ... - Tell me . And you keep looking at it . You keep believing and you keep fighting . 'Cause that 's what you do . You and that board , you 're Mr. Stick-To-lt , don 't you see ? That 's why you 're going to die , Mark . You just don 't give up . You just ... I swear to God , Mark , I am gonna miss you . Charlie 's gonna miss you , too . You are gonna die , Mark . You 're gonna die . But there is an upside , and this is gonna sound a lot harsher than it really is ... Deep down , you know what I mean . You 're going to die . But your daughter 's gonna be better off when you 're gone . [ Groaning ] I 'm not finished ! [ Growling ] Let go of me ! [ Breathing heavy ] Clean yourself up , playboy . - Get him the hell out of here . - You gotta be kidding me . You 've been on the brink of losing control all day . All year . - That crazy son of a bitch ... - Out now . - I don 't care what day it is . - No , Stan . I 'm not going anywhere . - Get out . - You can 't do this to me ! You 're not gonna do this ! We are gonna have so much fun tonight . I promise . I was just really looking forward to a picnic . That 's what we 're doing . We gotta get there early and stake out some good seats for the fireworks . It 's just there 's gonna be 2,000 other people . I wanted to be with you . There 's never been a night like tonight . In four hours , people are gonna be deciding whether to make their own futures happen . I want to be witness to that . Why ? ' Cause your future didn 't happen ? Oh ... Where did that come from ? I 've just been thinking a lot about the visions lately . And I 'm ... I 'm worried mine may have already started . You 'll be with me . No . It won 't . It 's not . Nothing is gonna happen to you tonight . I promise . Come on . Let 's go . It 's not the drowning . It 's that feeling I had . You know , like I deserved it . I 've been keeping a secret from you . It 's really stupid now , because when I tell you , you 're gonna hate me . Come on . Give me some credit . Keiko . - She 's in Los Angeles . - What ? I 'm sorry . I should have told you as soon as I found out , but I just ... I was afraid you 'd choose her . No , just ... Just tell me where she is . Some people from the hospital , they went down to this immigration detention center in Lancaster . - She 's in jail ? - No , it 's just a holding facility . You let her stay in jail ? I should have told you , Bryce . I 'm sorry . [ Woman ] Keiko Arahida . [ Buzzer ] There 's someone here to see you . [ Man speaking over loudspeaker ] Keiko . Keiko . [ Both speaking Japanese ] Aaron ! Aaron ! Her heart has stopped . I need your help . Come on . Trace ? Trace ? Trace , no . Trace , breathe . Breathe , Trace . Tracy , no , no . Come on , sweetheart . Come on , sweetheart . Come on ! This can 't be like this . Come on back . Come back , Tracy . Come back . [ Distant cheering ] Yeah ! [ Hellinger ] This is just all over your head . You have no idea . [ Gunfire ] In every version of the future I saw , I saw this . [ Lloyd ] The forces of the universe are maybe pushing us towards the futures we 've seen . You are gonna die , Mark . But there is an upside . Deep down , you know what I mean . Your daughter 's gonna be better off when you 're gone . Uh , excuse me . Hey , look , I don 't mean to bother you , but ... In my vision , I had just quit drinking . And I , um ... I 'd really like to make that happen . Right now . See , I saw you and ... You look like you could use this . Here . No . It 's OK . I don 't ... [ chuckles ] [ Inhales , exhales deeply ] What made you change your mind ? I don 't know . I mean , I get why you did it . It worked , we have Hellinger . But Janis , I was so pissed off at you . Working for the CIA since Quantico . I ... I felt like I lost my best friend . It was like I didn 't know who the hell you were . You know , and then I 'm driving away , I got Campos in the backseat , I 'm looking in the rearview , and I 'm thinking , " Going to NLAP ? This is ... " It 's so like you . I know you , Janis . I mean , I don 't know what you were doing . I don 't know what the hell we 're doing tonight , but I ... I do know you . I told Zoey about the baby . - What ? Oh , Dem . There just comes a time when you you can 't lie anymore , right ? - Aaron , we need to stop now . - She 's going to be OK . Her brain has been deprived of oxygen too long . I know what I saw . - She 's been through enough . - We were here together . Her heart has stopped beating . She 's gone . Aaron ... [ sobs ] Let her go . I saw you , Trace . Tracy . I saw it . [ Rock music plays ] I like the string , buddy . The Chinese say red string brings luck . The Dutch say leave me alone . In my vision , you and I were talking to each other . You ever think about that ? Nope . 'Cause that 's not what I remember . [ Cell phone rings ] Lloyd ? Hey . I 'm sorry , I meant to call . I 'm at your house . Why haven 't you been answering your phone ? - Uh ... I just needed to get away . - When are you coming back ? Uh ... Not for a while . - What are you talking about ? - I just need some space , Lloyd . I need to get away from you and Mark and the flash forwards and ... all of it . - I need to get away . - No , Olivia , listen to me . Look , certain conditions have to be met if I 'm ... At 10 : 00pm , - you have to be here with me . - Don 't do this . Don 't make this about fate . Don 't make this about free will , OK ? I have Charlie to think about . So I am not gonna be in that house with you tonight . - I 'm sorry . - [ Phone beeps off ] They 're not coming back . No . [ Rock music continues ] Yeah , no , I 'm sure it was you . Cheap suit and the bad breath and the droopy eyes . I kept saying , " Hey , man , why are the eyes so droopy ? " That 's it ? Is that the best you can do ? [ Chuckles ] So , you 're one of those guys . - Am I ? - Yeah . You 're fighting fate . And it 's so sad , man . 'Cause it 's so obvious , man , you 've already lost . [ People shouting ] [ Groaning ] [ Soft guitar rock music ]

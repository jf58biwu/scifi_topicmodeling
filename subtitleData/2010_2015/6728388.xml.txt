 DEFIANCE : THE LOST ONES WEBISODES Transcript : unknown Sync : F @ R With special thanks to : minouhse No barkeep ? Who you gotta chup around here to get a drink ? He 'll be back . Nice jacket . Who 'd you kill for it ? Killed a lot of people . Hard to say . What 's it to you anyway ? I used to have one just like it . Have you seen this girl ? Hi . My name is Nolan . It 's okay . Come here . All right . Now , look at me . We 're gonna go . That 's it . So , what was that back at that temple there ? Some kind of wacko religious ceremony ? Yeah , Irathient is not really my first language . Well , you don 't talk much . I can appreciate that about you . Hey , those people , back there . They 're not gonna hurt you again . You 're safe , I promise . Good thing , I came across you . I think you might be able to help me out with something . I won this in an all-night Ivali game at a speakeasy . You know , the one just out past the Bedship Pass , the one with that great jukebox . There 's a waitress there . She 's got the most amazing pair of ... Sensoth bodyguards . Tough , large men . Anyway , uh ... I don 't have much use for this so I thought maybe you could help me out . It 's chocolate . You eat it . Listen , kid . This is what 's known as a precious commodity . So if I were you , I would grab at this with both hands . What 's the worse that can happen ? You turn human ? It 's all right . That 's it . Okay , thank you . Point made . Hey , No Man . This here is Lieutenant Eddie Braddock . Hey . You can call him Uncle Eddie . Hey , don 't get too attached , huh . This one 's bound for the refugee camps in the morning . Eddie , she might understand English . Does it really matter ? You know what happens to kids in those camps . Let her know what she 's up against . Have you seen this girl ? A long drive sure do leave you ragged . Dodging all that Votan scrap , nothing on the radio since Topeka , too much time alone makes a man unpredictable , and I 've been driving such a long time . Must be some piece of ass to bring you all the way to the Storm Divide . Oh , you might wanna rephrase that , friend . The world 's full of dirty I-raths . Who gives a shtak about that one ? She 's my daughter . She disappeared . And at this point , I 'd do just about anything to find out where she is . So I 'm gonna ask you again , nice . Have you seen her or not ? Easy there , cowboy . No one causes trouble in my bar but me . I 'm not looking for trouble , friend . Just clearing up a misunderstanding . The man disrespected my kid . That gun in your holster , take it out . Slowly . Lenny ? No Man Nolan . Well , I 'll be damned . I haven 't seen you since , what ? The winter of ' 39 . That night , that we stole Torc 's bad hellbug . I still got the scar . - Yeah . So what brings you out to the ass-end of the Storm Divide ? My daughter . That little I-rath kid that used to follow you around ? Her name is Irisa . I think you might be able to help me with something . From what I heard , the last guy that tried to help you , that Braddock guy , he ended up being locked up in an E-Rep prison for six years . I don 't know what you 're talking about , Len . All right . You 're ready ? Let 's go . Come on . Stay close . We should be fine . Hey . Where the hell are you going ? For a walk . Nolan , you don 't wanna do this . Eddie , I can 't send her to that place . Look at her . She 's all skin and bone . She won 't last a week . Sorry , I 'm missing the part where that 's my problem . This cute little kid is gonna grow into an adult who 'll slit your throat without blinking . I 'm missing the part where that is your problem . All I 'm asking you to do is look the other way for a couple of minutes . Don 't do this . The E.M.C. is gonna hunt you down . And they will not stop until you 're locked up or dead . I guess we better get moving then . All right . I 'll stall as long as I can . I 'll owe you one . Hey , what 's the worst that can happen , right ? Nolan , I 'm telling you as an old friend . You need to manage expectations . These I-raths , they 're nomadic . She might have wanted to be with her own kind , and maybe she doesn 't want to be found . No , we 're family . Wouldn 't leave , not without saying goodbye at least . Hey , didn 't you once pay a brain-dead bio-man 10 scrip to babysit her in Yuma ? Bio-men are surprisingly nurturing . And you dragged her along to every single whorehouse in Kansas City . You lurching towards an eventual point ? Yeah . If you were my dad , I 'd wanna get far , far away . If you were my kid , I 'd shoot us both . Anyways , what makes you think that she 's out here in the Storm Divide and in Denver of all places ? This is where I rescued her from that Votan snake cult . I thought we wiped them all out that day , but now I 'm not so sure . She 's never quite gotten it out of her head . I thought she might come back out here , looking for answers . Here I am . What , you 're leaving ? Yeah . I 'll see if that Votan temple is still standing that I found her in . Look , the Razor Rain is just starting to come down . Why don 't you wait it out ? Take a snore in one of the sleeper racks . Yeah , I think I 'll take my chances . You 're no good to her if you get hit in the head with a flying piece of scrap metal . Listen , take this , on the house . Another one of these , I 'll be on my ass . A little help ? On Casti , we had a saying ... Varus will pay double for this . Maybe I should give him a call . A crime lord will pay you nothing . Varus will slit your throat and weave your jonder into his beard for decoration . I know this guy , and he more than has it coming . But I 'm just curious . What is it exactly that he stole from you ? Salvation . Redemption . I will see these things return . Come on . Come on . Nothing to see here . Go back to base . I really am an idiot . I always have been . I think I 've just outdone myself this time . They 're going to catch up with me for sure . Throw me in the stockade . Hell , they 'd probably execute me on the spot for this one . And for what ? You don 't even know what I am saying , you little weirdo . No , you 're right . No need for name calling , you 're probably perfectly normal on your home planet . Hey , it 's all right . You 're okay . I told you , I 'm not going to let anything happen to you . Look , we 're just gonna ... Park up here for the night so go to sleep . Please ? Fine , you want to be like that ? All right . You asked for it . As I slept upon the ark . This is happening . I dreamt about a tree . In it sat a Casti bird . Who sang of Kahmali . Kahmali , Kahmali . Made with ivory hair . Starlight came along with thee . And swallows in the air . This is about the girl . Oh , she is so much more than just a girl . Ah . So you 're a part of that snake cult ? You people tortured that little girl . And Joshua Nolan came and blew you all to hell . He tried to slaughter us . Scatter us like ash to the winds , but here we stand . Hey ! Hey ! You said you were going to ask him some questions and rough him up a little . I believe our business here has come to an end . Or would you care to renegotiate ? Sorry , No Man . A guy 's got to eat . Lenny ? Lenny , you son of a bitch . What the hell did you do to me ? Lenny has gone for the evening . He asked that we lock up . What do you want with me ? My scrip chip ? Take it . Not much there but you can help yourself . I don 't want your money . I know you . You 're a part of that cult I raided years ago . And that snake charmer Daigo wasn 't the only piece of scum that made it out . Where is the ilata ? I don 't know . And even if I did . Sure as hell wouldn 't tell you . You took the ilata from us . Where is she ? Her name is Irisa . And I didn 't take her . I saved her . All right . I 'm going to take a look around , see if I can 't find us something to eat . You stay put . That means , don 't go anywhere . Good chat . What happened ? This , yeah ? All right . It 's okay . I know . I know . I know . I know , look . It looks scary , but ... Looks scary , but it 's just a tool . It does what you tell it to . You want to try ? Yeah ? Like that ? That 's it . There you go , okay . Now , what have we got here ? Here we go . Let 's put your thumb there , right up against the tang on the back , and grip the handle nice and tight . And keep your wrist flexible so it can 't get knocked out of your hand . That 's it . Good . Side to side , up and down , never straight in . Look at you . Well , you 're a natural , kid . A little scary , but you 're a natural . Where is she ? Where is she ? You never cared about her . You tortured her , you and that monster , Daigo . We don 't own our bodies , our blood . Someone who has taken as many lives as you must understand that . It was war , as a soldier . Fighting for a cause , yes ? So were we . The ilata means more to the world than you can imagine . So if it costs us our lives , the lives of children , even our own , so be it . Then you do understand . No , I was just remembering how I put that little club of yours out of business , before you could hurt Irisa . That ... She had a destiny ! She was special ! And you took that away from her . You dressed her up like a human , like a ... What is the word ? A dochola , a clown ! As you can imagine , the loss was considerable . You 're right . You 're right . I 'm not much of a father . Never was . So you admit your failings ? I nearly got her killed a hundred times . Just remember it 's not a toy . Hold on . Here they come , kid . Better hide . Didn 't have to tell you twice . Hold it right there ! Oh , good afternoon . What brings you around these parts ? You know why I 'm here . Wasn 't there supposed to be a girl ? Yeah , she gave me the slip back in Dallas . I haven 't seen her since . Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey . I 'll go easy , fella . You 're a deserter in a time of war . My order is to put you down . Well , war is pretty much over right ? So why don 't we call it right here ? There 's a nice little bar down the street , my treat , two-for-one slammer . On your knees ! A little warning before we do something like that again , huh ? You 're an idiot . Come on , kid . We have a long road ahead of us . I did the best I could . Which is more than I can say for your boss . He is a great man . He 's a frightened little chivo who ran off at the first sign of trouble . Left you holding the bag . That 's a lie . Yeah ? I 've been to Manhattan . He 's packed up , scurried off under a rock somewhere . He has not forgotten us . He 's lying low in New Chicago , in constant contact with his followers . Chicago , huh ? Good to know . Since you were wondering what gives me the right to be her father , because I never gave up on her . And I never will . Nice job . I see , you 've still got that knack of showing up after the heavy lifting has been done . It 's called conserving energy . I 'm a very efficient organism . - Thanks . Chicago , huh ? That 's where I 'll find Daigo . You may not like what you find there . That 's not going to stop me from trying . Irisa 's out there somewhere . I 'm going to find her .

 Mayday ! Mayday ! Can anybody hear me ? Somebody ! Somebody please come in ! Mayday ! Mayday ! If anyone can hear me , we need help . Immediately ! We are four climbers trapped on the North slope , Gangkhar went soft . We need help . We are approximately 10,200 feet . Anyone ! Please ! Help ! Mayday ! Mayday ! Charles ! Charles ! Charles , what are you doing ? We 're close , I know it . It 's just over that ridge . Please ! We must stay , at least until the storm passes . I 'm not asking anyone else to come with me . Charles ! Get back in here ! Charles ! Damnit . Charles ! Mr. Weatherby ! Mr. Weatherby ! Charles , this is insanity ! You 're gonna freeze to death . You need to wait out the storm ! Charles ! This isn 't worth dying for ! Mayday ! Mayday ! I have three climbers on the North peak of Gangkhar Puensum , 10,200 feet . Do you copy ? Charles ! You don 't even know if it 's really even up here . Oh my God , it 's Adderton . [ speaking foreign language ] What 's he saying ? He said we 're never getting off this mountain . Is anybody there ? We must go , now ! [ screams ] Ahhhhhhhh ! Jensen ! Jensen ! Mayday ! Mayday can anyone hear me ! Jensen ! [ screams ] Ahhhhhhhh ! Mayday , mayday , do you copy ? My God , please somebody help us ! We 're on the North side of Gangkhar Puensum , 10.200 feet . Help us ! All right , Dave . Good job . Good job buddy , I need a little bit more slack , okay ? No ! Sorry ! It 's all right . Now one hand in front , one hand in the back . All right buddy , good job . Now watch me , okay ? Watch me . Hello ? Hey , pay attention ! David ! Watch me . Hello ? Mr. Donovan ! [ laughing ] It 's all right , David . You 'll get it next time . [ laughing ] Mr. Donovan ? Ward Donovan ? See you Mr. Donovan . See ya ! All right boys , good work today . So I assume you 're not here for climbing lessons . No sir , I am not . So what can I do for you ? Well I take it you 're familiar with Gangkhar Puensum ? Puensum ? Yeah , it 's the tall ... tallest unclimbed mountain in the world . Well , about four weeks ago I agreed to finance a climbing expedition for some business associates of mine and hired a top-notch climber to be their guide . Puensum 's forbidden . Yes it is . It is . However , in my experience I 've found that there are very few rules in life that can 't be broken with a little creativity . In any event , I received word three hours ago from base camp that they 've lost all contact with the expedition . I 'm sorry to hear that . I was hoping that I could secure your services for a rescue operation . My services ? I need someone who can get up the mountain quickly . You have the record for the fastest ascents of Kilimanjaro , Everest . Second fastest on K2 . I 've done my homework Mr. Donovan , you 're my man . Well your homework should also tell you that I 'm retired . Look , Mr. Burton , I would love to help you , I really would , but ... I haven 't been up in a mountain in three years . I ... I can 't do it . I see . Well I assure you money is no object Mr. Donovan . Money 's not the issue . It can 't be done . Puensum 's 24,000 feet up . It takes weeks to acclimate to the altitude . I don 't know anything about the mountain , nobody does . I do . Tell you what , this is the SAT phone number for Kate Pratt . She 's my ex so don 't tell her you got it from me . You don 't have to do that . She 's the best climber I know . Mr. Donovan , she 's the one who is leading my expedition . So you see why I 've come to see you . Well it still doesn 't change the fact that it can 't be done . Well what if I told you I could take care of the altitude problem ? But you can 't . I can . Believe me , I can . Now , my son Tyler is standing by with a jet to take you and your team to Timboo , from there we have a helicopter to take you to the mountain . I can meet you there . You 're really serious about this ? I need your help , Ward . So does Kate . If we do this , we do it my way . The helicopter will return for you in an hour . Pilot says we 're almost there . I 've gotta admit I was a little surprised when my father said you 'd be joining us , considering what happened up on Manaslu . I forget , how many people were lost on that expedition ? Six ? Seven ? Hey ! You weren 't there . Don 't sweat it , chief . I believe in ya ! Tyler , I need you up here for a second . All right , so Kate 's team made it as far as here . Now , it 's just north of that forbidden notch . That 's gonna put us at about ... about 22 . I ... uh , I 'm sorry . 22,000 ? Is that a problem doc ? Having cold feet ? Nnn ... no , not at all . Don 't worry doc . If anyone could do it , it 's the boss ! He and I have been climbing together for years . So I 've heard . Hey , if you wanted a real story all you had to do was ask . Okay , so ... what happened ? Boss and his girlfriend Kate were leading an expedition . Rich executives , thrill seekers ... that sort of thing . Storm came in , boss wanted to turn back . Clients paid him to keep going . Five of them never made it back . There she is ! All right . Guys please . Guys wait ! Listen to me . We 've got people on that mountain , you 've got a responsibility to them , please ! Damn . Come on ! Guys ! It 's only a damn myth ! Please confirm that the team is down . Team is on the ground . What the hell are we doing here ? It 's where we base out of . Why not the bottom of the mountain ? The locals tend to frown on mountain climbing . Frown ? More like forbid . So you pass yourself off as a relief effort , is that it ? The population of this country has a poverty rate of 30 percent , the majority of which live in these rural villages . Surely no one would question someone offering a helping hand , right ? Welcome . There he is . Thanks for getting here so quickly and getting your team together . Uh , Ward this is Mr. Ryder , our base camp manager . And this is ... Yeshe ! I thought you might know each other . Everest ' 03 , best trip I ever climbed with . You remember Chance ? Of course ! And this is Dr. Nina Preston . Nice to meet you . Nice to meet you . You gonna show us what we 're up against ? Yes , absolutely . If you uh , follow me I 'll show you where our communications are set up . Where are they going ? They 've heard about the trouble on the mountain . They 're afraid . Come on we should meet up with the others . Afraid of what ? We should meet up with the others . Come on . My God , you 're right . How did we miss this ? How did you know ? Saw it from the chopper . So what does this do to our timetable ? I think if you can get the helicopter to take us up and drop us off right about here , near the advance camp , we can probably make our way up to Forbidden Notch before it hits . Yeah ? I 'm sure we can arrange that . All right . What do you have up there ? We have a small support team , but we have lost communication with everyone on the mountain . In other words , you have no idea . Can we listen to the last communication before you lost contact ? But I must warn you , it 's a little disturbing . Base camp please ! Base camp come in ! There 's something up here with us . It 's keeping me from getting down the mountain . What is that ? Shh ! Base camp ! Come in ! Oh my God . [ distant screams ] There 's something out here on this mountain with us . [ distant screams ] Base camp , can you hear me ? [ distant screams ] Turn it off . Turn it off . What the hell was that ? Get everybody together , get the equipment . Tell the pilot we 'll leave in 20 . Yes boss . Come on doc . You have those supplies I requested ? Yes , we 'll get them organized . Ryder , give us a hand . Yeshe , are your people ready ? They 're all gone now Ward . What do you mean they 've gone ? They said that they are punishing your friends because they broke the covenant . They also said that if we follow , we too shall face the wrath . It is said that many years ago my people were visited by the gods who came down from the heavens . This is their mountain . That is why it is illegal to climb . Base camp ! Base camp come in . Base camp can you hear me ? Hunter ? Hunter how ya doing back there ? Oh my God ! Base camp ! Base camp ! Ahh ! All right kiddies , time for your medicine . What is it ? It 's for the altitude . This 'll keep you good up to 26,000 feet , courtesy of Burton Med Tech . You 're up Texas ! Hey , whoa whoa whoa . Hey guys ! Guys , I 'll do it . All right , all right . Easy . It 's all yours . You 're not afraid of needles , are you ? Of course not . All right , all right . Enough , enough . It 's okay . How long does this last ? About 24 hours , after which you will experience nose bleeds and other adverse effects . Adverse effects ? What kinda adverse effects ? Don 't worry , we 're packing plenty more . I 'm gonna get the others for their shots . You boys gonna be okay together ? What you got here ? Hey , hey , hey ! Those things are worth more than what you make in a year , easy ! What 's it do ? Kate and her team are equipped with GPS beacons . Once we 're in range it 'll pinpoint their exact location . Fancy . Hey ! Careful man . Dumbass . Alright , we got picks , check ... Helicopter 's ready . You said that this expedition started four weeks ago . That 's right . This says she left two months ago . Well , she got her dates wrong . Must have . Good luck Mr. Donovan . Here , you should take the extra hemo-rethros . Please confirm when the team is down . Copy that base . Oh , and Ram , that storm is moving in fast so get back up in the air as soon as possible , okay ? Copy that . Landing zone is in sights . Where the hell is everybody ? No idea , sir . Hello ? Hello ? Where the hell is everybody ? They didn 't all go up the mountain . It 's quite the expedition your father 's got going here . Well , that 's my father for you . How long they been up here , anyway ? Longer than four weeks , I can tell ya that . Do me a favour , take a look around and see what they 're really doing here . Yes boss . Everybody have a quick look , check your gear , we 're gone in 10 . Yeshe . What is it ? It is the prayer rocks we use to ask to climb the mountain . It 's destroyed . They built a new one over there . Why the hell would they move it ? A lot of fancy equipment you 've got up here . Lot of weather surveillance equipment , that sort of thing . Boss wants us to have a look around , see if we can find anything to help us narrow our search . Well , there 's nothing here . What you got there ? Just a book . Let 's get going ! What the hell ? All right everybody , grab your gear . Ward ! Storm 's coming hard and fast you guys , we gotta go . Gear up and go . Boss ! What ? Something in hee you need to see . What the hell ? It 's Bowman . What 's going on ? We 're getting outta her . Why ? Because they 're all dead . Dead ? How ? Yeshe , your people . They heard Kate 's last transmission , didn 't they ? That 's why they all ran , they knew something was up here ! Why didn 't you tell us ? ! I thought it was only a myth . Graham , please get us out of here . You guys go if you want , I 'm staying for Kate and the others . No human did that . That guy was ripped apart . Doesn 't change the fact that there 's still people on the mountain that need our help . Graham , how much higher can you take us ? He 's not taken us higher . Air 's too thin , it 's too dangerous . Ward 's right , but if I fly back to base I might be able to drop off some extra equipment and some fuel , we could do a visual sweep of the mountain , help narrow down the search . No . No , too risky . Maybe we should let the pilot decide . I can do this . Fine . Who 's staying with me ? Ram , Ram , what do you see ? What do you see ? 15,000 feet . Looks like turbulence . Hold it . Okay baby , hold it . Did Ram go back up again ? Yeah , he went higher . Thought he could help narrow the search . Above advanced base camp ? Yeah . Come on . Ram this is Burton , do you read me ? Copy that . Ram I need you to get the hell outta there immediately . I 'm just going in a little closer . Ram , you are up too high . Turn around immediately . No , no , no . We can make it . Can 't we baby ? We can make it . We need that helicopter , Ram . Ram it 's too dangerous . Get out of there NOW ! Approaching 22,000 feet . Ram , you are up to high . I need you outta there NOW ! Just give him another minute . No . Ram . Ram get out of there now . Ram , do you hear me ? Get out now ! Ram ! I 'm losing him here . Hold in there baby . We can do it . That 's my girl . No ! Go ! Get outta here it 's not safe ! No ! Ram . Ram do you read me ? Hold on . I see someone ! I think I see someone . Did he say he sees someone ? Are you confirming visual contact ? Just one person . She 's waving me down . I 'll move closer . What do you see Ram ? What do you see ? Say again , say again . One person , they 're wearing a green jacket and a white helmet . He sees someone ! Green jacket , white helmet . It must be Kate ! [ In Spanish ] She 's waving me in , I 'm going to try to land . No ! Get out ! Go ! Wait . She 's warning me . Go ! Go ! What the hell is that ? Hold on . Hold on ! [ In Spanish ] Pull up baby . Mayday ! Mayday ! Mayday ! Ram . Ram get outta there now ! What the hell is that ? Ram , do you hear me ? Get out now ! I 'm going to crash ! Ram ! Ram do you copy ? Ram do you read me ? Ram ! Damn ! Hold on baby ! No ! Boss ! What the hell was that ? Hug the wall ! Everybody hug the wall ! [ screams ] Ahhhhhhhh ! Nina ! Nina hold on ! Hang on , Nina . Hang on ! Yeshe , climb down to her . Clip her in , get a safety on her . I 'm coming , hold on . Hold on ! Help ! I 'm coming . Help ! [ screams ] Ahhhhhhhh ! Nina ! Nina , get a hold . Get a hold ! You guys got her ? Hang on , Nina ! It 'll be all right . Yeshe 's going to take care of you . Got her ? Hey you guys got her over there or what ? You 're in good hands Nina . Yeshe ! Yeshe ! [ screams ] Ahhhhhhh ! [ screams ] Ahhhhhhh ! Base camp calling Ram , come in . Base camp calling Ram , come in Ram . This is base camp calling Ram , come in . He should have turned round . Any luck reaching the others ? No . They 'd be on the southern face by now . Not going to be in range until they 're below the rock grid . Mr. Burton ? I think you should get down here , we might have a problem . We got company . Hide everything and I 'll stall them . Okay . What 's the meaning of this ? I demand to speak to whoever 's in charge ! Under who 's authority are you here ? Sir Walter Burton . I 'm Captain Kelden . Welcome to Bhutan . I don 't understand , we 're a peaceful operation . Of course you are . Okay . Okay . Come on , come on . Hurry . That 'a boy . That 'a boy ! Just like back in the day . That was a great idea , sending that helicopter up there . Nobody forced him to come . Why didn 't you just stay down there , leave the climbing to us ? I don 't think I like your tone . Yeshe 's dead all cause of you . Hey , he volunteered all right ? Hey , enough ! Guys . Why don 't you ask him what he was searching for at base camp ? Keep talking cowboy ! Hey ! I said enough ! Guys ! Guys ! What the hell is that ? All right , that 's it . We 're getting the hell outta here . They 're probably already dead , these things could be all over the mountain . We came to find Kate and the others . We 're not leaving . I agree with Ward . My pack . The hemo-rethros was in my pack . That pack 's long gone . It 's a 2,000-foot drop down to the bulge . Well what does that mean exactly ? It means we got about eight hours ' til our lungs collapse , our brains swell and we die . Nicely done doc . Excuse me . It 's not your fault , don 't worry about it . I 'm sorry . Hold on ! Let me get ya outta there . Ram . [ coughs ] I 'm gonna get you outta here , okay ? What the hell were you doing up at this altitude ? Not too smart , huh ? [ coughs ] I should 've listen to Ward . What ? Ward 's here ? Probably half way up the mountain by now . This is crazy . If we can get down to advanced base camp , I can get somebody to patch you up . They 're all gone . They 're all dead . What was that thing ? We have to get out of here . Hold on Ram ! I 'm gonna come and get you down , all right ? All right , I 'm coming down ! [ In Spanish ] It 's okay Ram , I 'm gonna get you down , okay ? Okay . All right . Grab onto my hand . I don 't wanna die . You 're not gonna die . I 'm gonna get you down . Shh ! Shh ! Shh ! We 're gonna get you down okay ? [ screams ] Ahhhhh ! As you can see Captain , we 're on a relief mission . And we 're operating with the complete cooperation with the D.P.T. Your influence over certain members of my government has been well known . However , the Royal Army is under my jurisdiction . Please tell your men to be careful , this is very expensive equipment . Okay , okay . Okay ! Captain , please . All we 're trying to do is help . Naturally . The health and welfare of my people is up utmost importance to me . Now what sort of aide are you providing me ? Antibiotics , vaccines , nutritional supplements . And this can all be verified on your manifest ? Yes Captain . Of course , if I were to find out your interest in my country was of a different nature , I would be severely disappointed . Naturally . My people take their beliefs very seriously . Did you know that violation of religious law is punishable by death ? We are here to provide medical aide , nothing more . Of course . Oh , however ... You wouldn 't mind if my men took a look around , would you ? Whatever you like Captain . Here ! Try some of this . Trust me , it 's experimental but it works . The forbidden notch ! It 's as far as they made it . It 's a lot bigger than a base camp . What the hell are they doing down there ? Hell of a good question , boss ! Kate ! Kate ! Kate ! She was further up the mountain . I mean , Ram said he saw her right ? So whatever happened , she wasn 't here for it . Ward to base . Ward to base . Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! What were your Daddy 's people doing up here ? I have no idea . What were they looking for ? Why the hell did they need all these explosives ? How the hell should I know ? Guys ! Guys ! The storm 's outta control ! Get in the tent ! We need to ride this thing out . Chance ! Chance come on . Get on your feet . There 's a camera ! Just leave it ! Almost got it boss . Got it ! [ loud growls ] [ loud growls ] Day 2 , Site 3 . 8 : 15 AM . The sonar results here show another sizable cavern directly below us . Much like Site 2 , which Martin and his team descended this morning . We 're preparing to penetrate the cavern here with some good old-fashioned C-4 . Oh , and here we have the person responsible for getting us up here in the first place . Kate ! Pretty exciting huh ? Come on smile ! We 're making history here . I 'll smile when we 're safely down this mountain . Kate and Hunter there are climbing up the mountain to survey the south ridge . Wave Bye Kate ! They 're searching for an existing entrance . Try warming it up , rub it in your hands . It works . It 's working ! Test . Test . Day 2 , Site 3 . 10 : 05 AM . We 've just finished placing the explosive . We 're feeling very optimistic about what we hope to find down there . This could be it . Looks like we 're ready . Here we go ! Fire in the hole ! [ explosion ] No ! Help ! Run ! [ screams ] Ahhhh ! All right , I 've seen enough . I 'm getting the hell outta here ! Chance , Chance , Chance ! Wait , wait ! Come here ! Just calm down , just ... Calm down ? Are you serious ? Did you see the same tape I just saw ? Calm down ? Are you kidding me ? The hell was that thing ? What are they looking for ? Get off me ! Start talking Tyler ! In 1954 , a British explorer named Charles Weatherby disappeared during an expedition up this mountain . Three days before he disappeared , he claimed to have discovered something of supreme significance . Something that would rock the foundations of civilization . He said he found Shambala . This is his map . A few years ago , a villager discovered this at the base of the mountain . My father went to great expense and trouble to find that thing . Wait , wait . What is Shambala ? It 's a mythical kingdom . Sort of a Himalayan Utopia . According to the myth , it offers infinite wealth and knowledge to whoever finds it . Like Shangri-La ? That 's what all this is about ? Some damn legend ? People are dead ! [ loud roars ] Go ! Go ! Get down ! Get down ! Get down ! Get down ! [ loud roars ] Keep going ! I 'm right behind you ! [ loud roars ] Hey ! Up here ! [ loud roars ] Guys ! Down here . Ward ! Over here boss ! Guys ! Guys , is Nina down there with you ? Ward look out ! Look out ! Ward ! Guys , go ! [ loud roars ] What the ... What the hell is this place ? These are my father 's men . Come on . C-4 . Come in handy . Is there detonators ? It 's useless without the detonators . Nina ! You all right ? I 'm okay . Can you climb down ? It 's okay , I saw it leave . [ screams ] Ahhhhhhhh ! Nina ! We gotta get the hell out of here ! Tyler this is base , do you read ? Tyler come in this is base . Do you read me ? Where is it ? I ... I ... I don 't know what you 're talking about . Where is it ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . Please . You 've already disrespected our laws , don 't insult my intelligence . You 're not here on behalf of the army , are you ? It appears that we are both engaging in a game of deception . One year ago , a peculiar item , a piece of animal hide with a map on the back was sold at an auction by a collector in Beijing . And this map supposedly told the whereabouts of a place my people hold very sacred . Yet the buyer did not identify himself . It was you , wasn 't it ? I don 't know what you 're ... Where is Shambala ? I don 't ... I 'm telling you the truth ! I don 't know ! Please ! Mr. Burton , you will tell me what I need to know one way or another . Take him . Now ! Please ! Yeah ! Dammit ! Come on . What the hell is that ? We gotta keep going . All right , and you know what ? We 're not going one more step until you tell us what the hell 's going on . What is so damn important that your father 's risking people 's lives out here ? Risking the life of his son ? He 's dying . My father 's dying . He 's got terminal brain cancer . Maybe a month ... at best . That man dedicated his entire life to medicine , to saving people 's lives , and now he 's got an incurable disease . How 's that for irony ? Look , I know that the cost of this has been high , but if there 's even the slightest chance that somewhere under this mountain is the ultimate cure ... then as far as I 'm concerned , it 's worth it . Let 's go . Wait ... wait , wait , wait ! Shh ! Shh ! Do you hear that ? I got a signal ! That 's impossible down here . Always the optimist Chance . [ sniffing ] Can you tell who it is ? No . Signal 's too weak . Chance , let 's go ! All right boss . Holy hell . Tyler what is this place ? This is incredible . No one 's seen this for hundreds , maybe thousands of years . Look at this structure . Whoever built all this , they weren 't primitive . They were advanced . Guess it wasn 't built by the locals . But when was it built ? Not recently . Guys ! Guys , over here . What ? What the hell is that ? Is that ... That 's a helicopter . Wait , wait , wait . Shine your light , right there . There 's somebody there . That 's Morse code ! It 's Kate . Kate ! Kate , stay there ! Give me your pack . Stay there ! I 'm coming down ! Guys . Guys ! There 's something down there . [ squeals ] What is going on ? Where are you taking everyone ? Since you will not divulge the location of Shambala willingly , you 're going to show me . I ... I don 't know . We lost contact with the team . I don 't know if they found anything at all ! Unfortunate . Okay , she 's ready . Boss , this is all we got left . Go . Wish me luck boys . Don 't be long ! Kate ! Remember the rescue on K2 ? That 's what we 're gonna do , okay ? I 'm gonna let you handle this . Where you goin ? I 'm gonna find a way outta here . No . We gotta stick together . Who knows how many of those things are out there . Just gonna take a look around . Hang on ! I got a rope coming down to you ! I need you to go straight forward , all right ? Straight forward . Hang on ! All clear boss . All right . Here we go . Kate ! Kate ! [ loud squeals ] All right , here we go . Here we go . [ loud squeals ] You ready ? Okay , I 'm good ! Here we go . Look out boss ! Chance ! Throw one , throw it ! We 're outta flares boss ! Ward ! We got ya ! Go , go , go ! I got you boss ! Almost there . God , I never thought I 'd be so happy to see you . You never could pull very fast , could ya ? Chance ! Get down here . Be right down . Shambala ! Oh Dad you were right . [ squeals ] Got ya ! You 're a nasty little guy ! Ew ! Ahh ! Ahhhh ! Son of a bitch ! You 're a vicious little son of a bitch , aren 't ya ? Oh my God . It 's healed ! Their blood , it 's the fountain of youth . Bingo ! All right , come here . That 's it . Oh yeah . Come on . Whatever set up shop here definitely wasn 't from this zip code . Maybe these drawings are some kinda guard dog they brought with them . You know , some kinda alien protector . Protecting what ? The only thing I care about is finding Tyler and getting the hell out of here . Where are you ? There you are ! [ squeals ] Come on . Oh yeah ! Thank you very much . Oh crap . [ loud screams ] Ahhhhhhhhh ! I say we get outta here . Who cares about him or his father . Oh my God Chance , your nose is bleeding . It 's nothing . What 's wrong ? I said I 'm fine . Chance , hold up . Let 's have a look at him . It 's high altitude pulmonary edema . I thought he had the shot . I didn 't have the full dosage . Son of a bitch said it 'd be all right . How long has your nose been bleeding ? I can do it boss , I 'm fine . Keep going . [ distant screams ] Ahhhhhhh ! Tyler ! [ distant screams ] Ahhhhhhh ! Tyler ! Tyler ! Whoa , whoa , whoa , Oh God . That 's it , we 're outta here now . Let 's go , let 's go ! Oh my God . Chance ! Get up ! Get up right now ! Come on ! We gotta go . We gotta go right now ! Get out of here while you still can . I am not leaving you here ! Get up ! Come on . I 'm not getting off this mountain and you know it . Now go . Ward ! I can slow these things down , give you guys a fighting chance . Go ! Go ! Get outta here Ward . Now ! Stand up ! Kate , get him outta here . I 'm not leaving anyone behind , do you hear me ? Get up with me ! Come on ! Let me do this Ward . Don 't let me die for nothing ! [ loud growls ] Ward . Ward ! Go , go . There 's gotta be something here . Okay . Grab some C-4 , peel it open . Wait for me here . Okay , all right . Bring it here . Come on , come here . Wrap the C-4 around the oxygen bottle . All right , that 's it . Got it . Good . Good . You ready ? Ready ? Follow me . Come on , come on . Yeah . I don 't know what 's up there but it 's the only way out . You ready ? Let 's do it . Reach , reach ! [ explosion ] Let 's get the frack outta here . What have you done with the rest of my team ? Are they with you ? Not the guys with the guns . Captain this is outrageous ! Okay , we 're going aroun . Follow me . What is this ? What ? No , no ! On their knees ! No , no ! Please Captain , no ! This isn 't necessary , this is outrageous ! This is a humanitarian mission . I 'm going to give you one more chance Mr. Burton . Where is Shambala ? Please , Captain . You don 't have to do this . Please . No ! No ! [ gunfire ] No ! No ! no ! No ! We gotta help those people . Captain , please . Please , I 'll give you anything you want , anything you need . Just don 't hurt anyone else , please , don 't hurt anyone else . No ! I told you we lost contact ! Where were you looking ? I don 't know ! I don 't know . No ! Okay , okay , okay , okay . The forbidden notch . Thank you Mr. Burton . Kill them . [ gunfire ] No ! No ! No , no , no , no , no ! We gotta help them ! No . What are you doing ? No ! No ! [ gunfire ] No ! [ gunfire ] They 're getting ready to go up the mountain . They won 't go 'til first light . We 'll wait ' til dark and then we 'll go in . Untie him . Wait , where are the others ? Where 's Tyler ? I 'm sorry , it 's just us . What , what ? What do you mean ? We gotta go now ? We have to get you out of here . No , no listen to me . If we try to move , they will kill us . They 've already shot the rest of the team . Yeah ... We have to go . I 'd rather deal with them . Ward Donovan and Kate Pratt . See Mr. Burton really does hire the best people . And now we found our guide . I 'm not going back up there . Oh , you will . Right now . Let 's go . Hopefully you 'll prove yourself much more cooperative than Mr. Burton . You guys have no idea what you 're walking in to . You gotta listen to him . We have to get out of here before it 's too late . [ distant grumbling ] What was that ? You don 't wanna know . Go , go , go , go , go ! Come on ! We gotta get outta here ! Move ! [ loud roars ] Come on , come on , come on ! Get down , get down , get down , get down . [ gunfire ] [ loud roars ] [ gunfire ] What the hell was that thing ? It 's a druck . What the drucks is just a myth ! Does that look like a myth to you ? Run , run , run ! Where the hell is it ? [ gunfire ] [ screams ] Ahhhhhhhh ! I got an idea . Get ready to run . [ screams ] Ahhhhhhhh ! Run ! Come on . Come on , Kate come on ! Come on , Kate come on ! Big rock ! Come on , come on . Get down , get down ! [ explosion ] Holy moly . [ laughs ] Shall we ? Thought you 'd never ask . So , uh ... what do you think of Colorado ? What about it ? Well there 's this great climbing school there and I know they 're looking for another instructor . I know the guy who runs it ; I could put in a good word . Sounds like an adventure . Oh man , you have no idea .

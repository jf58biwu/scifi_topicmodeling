 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... There 's a bomb in Sykes 's wheelchair ! How did you know about that ? You came into my house and stole from me . And I will respond in kind . Someone from Artie 's past has been breaking into the Warehouse and sending out artifacts . Basically undoing his life 's work as a Warehouse agent . But nothing 's showing up on the security feeds . Which would explain why I 've been having the mega-vibes . But not why Artie 's been keeping us out of the loop . Or what black diamonds mean . He 's probably just trying to protect us . Yes , but from who ? None of you are reacting . Unhand me , human . Zz ! Agh ! Here , look . I used to be five-seven . Now I 'm five-ten and a half . I did not make this up . Ah , trust me , we 've heard stranger . Please be careful . We 're always careful . Says here , uh , Mr. Byck , that you updated your online dating profile on Tuesday ? Yes . Women consistently prefer taller men . Which they should . Taller men on average are more successful , and they make more money . Yeah , well , Tom Cruise is five-seven , but you stick with that . Also , chicks love robots . But that was before it got painful ? When this started , I didn 't care how or why . I ... I was thrilled . But I 've enough things wrong with me . I don 't need all my joints to ache too . Asthma , heartburn , restless leg , wellness anxiety . Hey , these are all alphabetical . I cracked the code . Would you please ! Jeez . Mr. Byck , what 's " Wellness Anxiety " ? Hypochondria . I might have that too . No ! No ! Well , it 's hard to believe Commander Data over there hasn 't found his soul mate . You think Artie just sent us on a wild goose chase to get us out of the Warehouse ? Whatever he 's keeping secret from us , Steve and Claudia 'll find out and they 'll let us know . Mm . Pete ? Look . He 's ... He 's taller than the stove hood now . It 's not a wild goose chase after all . Hey , Leena . Barry Byck has improved his dunk . So have two others . I 'm sending you over the info now . A John Tufano , near you , and a Lisa Bernardo on the other side of town . I suddenly realized I was taller . I was trying out a new recipe for the potluck . Moussaka ! Yeah , maybe I should just ... And all of a sudden I could reach the pots hanging above the range that I couldn 't reach before . Guys , we got another one . Pete , this is spreading fast . Ah ! Oh ! Ow ! Ah ! What 's happening to me ? Artie ? So far there 's been four cases . There 's no telling how widespread this thing could get . Yeah . They start out with just getting taller but pretty quickly it escalates to really painful . Gotta figure eventually it 's gonna be " now I 'm dead . " There 's no obvious connection between the victims so far . Different parts of town , different jobs . There 's ... There 's one more person we have to contact . Anthony ... A lawyer named Anthony Seklir . Seklir . So go talk to Mr. Seklir . Artie , what are you doing ? I 'm organizing my wire collection . It 's gotta be an artifact . Adults don 't have growth spurts . No short jokes , no fat jokes , no age jokes . Well , then I got nothin ' . So what about , um , Paul Bunyan 's axe ? Or ... Or David 's slingshot ? Or how about a magical bag of beans ? We got the axe , we got the slingshot . The beans ? Please . That 's just a fairy tale . Well , it 's good to know where we draw the line . Someone call a handyman ? What are you trying to do , kill me ? What are you two doing here ? You first . Might it have something to do with your new bling ? Where did you ... Where did you get that ? We found it in the Dark Vault , where Alice 's mirror used to be . That 's not unlike the box of them you found in that garage filled with artifacts , is it ? Now , you said you were gonna tell everyone about that , Artie . I did not . I said I would handle it . And I said there was a protocol to these things . If I know my Warehouse backbone architecture and I think we can all agree that I do , I 'd say you were trying to fix the Artifact Removal Detection System , since obviously it 's been on the fritz . Someone 's been getting in and out , and stealing artifacts . And the burning question on every agent 's mind is , why are you trying to hide it from us ? Did it occur to you that part of my job is deciding what is and what is not part of your job ? And the reason I 'm not telling you something may just be because I am protecting you ? Yes , that did occur to us . Mm . We also considered crankiness , senility , and " Artie 's just sugar crashing . " Did it mayhaps occur to you that we don 't need protecting ? I was ATF . I raided heavily armed compounds for a living . Not to mention that I 've already died on this job . Yeah . And I was bodyjacked by Alice because of this . Really ? You 're gonna compare that to dying ? Focus . Excellent suggestion . Why don 't you both focus ? On something else ! Artie . If you don 't tell us what we 're up against , how are we supposed to defend ourselves ? You 're obviously dealing with something huge . Stop trying to do it alone , and let us help . I was already too tall . Now I gotta buy all these new suits . I mean , look at this . Juries don 't exactly trust a lawyer in capri pants . Excuse me . I gotta eat . I have a hearing at lunchtime . Ooh . What ? Sorry . It 's just I haven 't eaten yet , so that 's kinda , ugh . In this line of work , you grab it when you can . Mykes , can we get Mexican ? No . What are those ? Heartburn . It 's too much stress . You know , Mr. Seklir , hot sauce is great for that . Byck , our first victim , wasn 't he was taking heartburn medication ? What wasn 't he taking ? Although , Reduxid . That does sound familiar . Okay , we need to check on Barry Byck and confirm that 's what he 's taking . Then find out if Tufano and Bernardo were taking it too . Gil ? We 're getting some odd reports from docs prescribing Reduxid in South Bend , Indiana . They say their patients are getting taller . I wanna go check it out . Just South Bend ? You know that sounds crazy . I know . I know . But sometimes you gotta follow up on crazy . If it turns out to be true and we get sued , the less we know the better . True , but on the flipside , this could lead to possible treatments for osteoporosis and growth hormone deficiency , cancer . Plus , there 's research that shows that men really want to be taller . It 's right up there with " better in bed " and " more hair . " Go . Ah ! Barry , can you get to the door ? Myka , stand back . Ah ! Ah ! Help me ! Help ! Oh . Oh , God ! So , all four came in in the last couple hours . Doc 's got ' em on morphine . Says their ... Their bodies are literally pulling themselves apart . Gives them , I don 't know , two days tops on the outside . Well , I talked to Artie . He 's gonna look for something to slow the effect . He 'll send it to the hotel if he finds it . Yeah , but what does a heartburn pill have to do with an artifact ? I don 't know . Maybe it 's some sort of chemical in the pill that interacts with the artifact when someone touches it ? So we 're looking for something that all four of these people touched in common . Pete , look at this . Byck and Tufano , both of them were prescribed Reduxid by the same gastroenterologist , a Dr. Selden . Maybe the artifact is , I don 't know , at his office . Well , it 's a place to start . And maybe while we 're there , he can give me something for my gas . Well , Pete , he 's a doctor , not a magician . Can I help you ? Yes . Agents Bering and Lattimer . We would like to speak to a Dr. Selden , please . Uh ... Excuse me . These people and I have been waiting . Pete ? Got it . Good . Sorry . Federal agents . Very important . Badge ? Gun ? Chin ? Okay , let 's go . Reduxid is in early market trials . And only a handful of doctors are prescribing it , in a select few cities . Did you treat all four of these patients ? No . Only Byck and Tufano . I don 't know the other two . Can I help you ? So this isn 't the connection . Uh ... Maybe we need to check the pharmacy where they got the pills ? Uh , no . Byck and Tufano went to different drug stores . Can I ask what you 're looking for ? And , uh , can I be a part of this ? Hi . Me again . Right . Uh , look , I know we had a little thing out there with the chin , but this is official business . Deb Stanley , Moorpark Pharmaceutical . We make Reduxid . Dr. Selden , Mr. Lieber is getting very impatient . Mr. Lieber and his spastic colon . Excuse me . We would be very interested to know if our pill is making people taller . It 's not just making people taller . There are four people currently in critical condition in the ICU . I didn 't know that . Okay , if it is the pill , it can 't just be the pill . Right ? I keep tabs of all the doctors that are participating in the trial , and whatever 's going on , it 's only happening here in South Bend . So if the FDA wants to get involved ... Whoa , whoa , whoa ! We 're not the FDA , okay ? We 're the Secret Service . Does the President have heartburn ? Wouldn 't you ? Miss Stanley , we 're not going after your company . And we already know that this is only happening in South Bend . So . We 're trying to help these people . Good . Me too . Well , uh , then you can get us a list of all the patients who are taking Reduxid currently that live in the city . Do you have a subpoena ? I know , subpoena , it 's ... It 's kind of a funny word , right ? It just sounds like ... Pete ? It 's okay . I grew up with three brothers . I ... Penis , it sounds like penis . Okay . So , you guys are looking for some environmental factor . Right ? Some place that the affected patients have been or something that they 've done in common . Something like that . Then we work together . Oh ... ... kay . Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay . So . Patient info is all by code , for confidentiality . Now , I don 't have the name of the patients . I only have the doctors ' numbers . But I can call them . I can ask them to have the patients talk to us . We still have to look into those four victims that we already know about . Why don 't we split up ? You dig into the four we know and I 'll go play doctor with Deb . Brother Adrian ? As in Brotherhood of the Black Diamond ? How ... How did you ... Well , as soon as we found the diamonds , I did some surfing . They 're a secret society in France . Yeah , well , secret society doesn 't quite capture it . One of the last offshoots of the Knights Templar . So what 's their beef with us ? Not us . Me . Brother Adrian has a grudge against me personally . So that 's why he 's been stealing artifacts that are meaningful to you . The grudge , more info , please . He 's trying to force me to do something that I ... I can 't do . What ... What does he want ? What that is , I can 't tell you . Suffice it to say , it would be bad . And that 's all you get . I am maxed out on my sharing quota for the day . Okay . We 'll wait outside . We 're just trying to help you here . I 'm sorry . Thank you . " I 'm sorry " and " thank you " in the same sentence ? Keep your eye out for four horsemen . Turns out the Mayans were right . How is this guy even getting in ? I mean , there 've been no security breaches , no break-ins , no unauthorized open doors . Well , he 's using an artifact , isn 't he ? One would assume . So , do you have any idea how to find him ? Uh , yeah . I 've got a number . But I 've tried tracing it , it 's routed through all these anonymous handoffs , it 's impossible . Oh , Artie . You are adorable . This is why you ask for help . The number , please . Anyone you tell will be in grave danger ! Uh , Secret Service stuff . Ah . Hey , Mykes . Anything ? No . There 's no connection between any of the victims yet . So , what about you ? How goes it with the , uh , second ex-future Mrs. Lattimer ? Not bad . Not bad . She 's , uh , not half the hardass we made her out to be at first . Hey , Mykes , uh , we just hit the last of the docs on the list . And none of the other patients are getting any taller . So it is limited to a small group . Okay , you know what ? I 'm gonna go back to the hospital , and see if any of the victims can talk . You stick with Deb . Really ? Yeah , I mean , there 's still some connection involving Reduxid that we haven 't figured out . So , you know , work your boyish charm . Investigate . All right . Well , twist my arm . You tell the President I 'll call him back when I 'm good and ready . Sorry . Yeah . So , Deb , I gotta tell ya , you were , uh , pretty good with the docs in there . Wow , sound more surprised . It is what I do . No , I know , it 's just , uh ... You know , when we first met , I ... I don 't know , I thought you were gonna be a little more ... Hardass ? I meant it in the best possible way . As in , " Wow , hard ass . " That 's not exactly the compliment a girl 's looking for . You could bounce a quarter off of mine . I do not want to know how you know that . Anyway . As it happens , I like doctors . My dad was one . He 's gone now . Oh , mine too . Uh , dead . Not a doctor . Also , sorry . So , why didn 't you follow in his footsteps ? Did you ever notice how most doctors already seem to know everything ? What ? You don 't find that attractive ? Oh ! No , no , no . You 're hiding that very well . Ah , see , there 's that hardass thing again . Point is , I prefer working in new drug development . I like being in a field that 's still discovering . I mean , the world 's full of surprises , right ? What time is it ? A little after 4 : 00 . Pete ! It 's me . Pete ! Hi . Hi . Hi . Hi . Oh ! Dressed . Yes , yes . Pete , open the door ! Oh , hey , Myka . Yeah . Hey . I 'm sleeping and , and what 's ... Okay , kind of . Get dressed , okay ? Leena picked up a 911 call from a new victim . And Artie sent us this . The Gold Spike that completed the Transcontinental Railroad . It pulls things together . He thinks it might slow the symptoms . You slept with her , didn 't you ? Well , you ... You told me to investigate , okay ? So . She 's unarmed . You know what ? Just get dressed . Okay , just . Oh ! What ? Okay , so this new victim is a Christian Scientist . All right ? Which means he doesn 't have a doctor . So , he never took the pill . The pill has nothing to do with this . Why are you such a slut ? Oh , Myka . Would you please just go ? I 'll be out in a minute . I 'm leaving . Go ! Fine . Fine ! Slut ! Hi . Hi . Hi , Deb . This ... This was great . Okay ? I mean , this was ... This was really great . And I 'm not ... I 'm not just saying it . Okay ? And I ... I 'm sorry that I have to run off , and all . But I just don 't want you to think that I 'm , you know , that guy . Pete . Listen , I ... I 'm a big girl . You know , occasionally , I 'm that guy . Oh . Yeah . That 's ... But you would 've called me though , right ? I mean ... Anyway , good news , uh , there ... There 's no connection to your pill . So the last guy who got taller , he didn 't even take it . So . Okay , uh , wow . Well , so , what do we do next ? Oh , we ? No , we ... We don 't ... We don 't do anything . Your company 's in the clear . Look , listen , I gotta go . Okay ? Pete . No ! Look , hey , hey , hey . I didn 't just come here to cover my company 's butt , you know ? I wanna help . Let me be a part of this . I 'm sorry . Okay ? I ... You can 't . I 'll call you though , okay ? I 'll call . I did ask nicely . Okay . You distract the EMTs . I 'll use the spike . Okay . Unit 321 , what 's your status ? We 're on site now . Hey , grab a ... Hey ! Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Guys , guys , guys . Okay . Secret Service ! Now I need you to move this vehicle ! ASAP . Copy that ? Are you kidding me ? Okay . All right . I 'm gonna help you . I need you to grab this . Okay . Okay . All right , you 're gonna be okay . All right . What 's that ? Go for Red Zebra 34 ? What ? He changed his route ? Agh ! That guy 's a pain in my ... All right , dudes . Well , as you were . But don 't worry . I 'll get you a signed picture . Meanwhile , you really should be taking care of Batman . Well , this should buy us a few hours , anyway . Unless we figure out what 's causing this , all of these people are gonna die . Gil , hey . It 's , uh , it 's not the Reduxid . But I ... I think I 'm onto something bigger . These Secret Service agents , they 're part of some group that collects , I don 't know , uh , objects with unusual properties . Things that make people grow taller and suspend out of control tissue growth . Who knows what other medical applications they 've been sitting on ? You 're sure about this ? Yeah . I 've seen it with my own eyes . This could be huge for us . I know . But listen , this growing thing , it 's really bad . We 've gotta figure out a way to help these people . Of course . Of course . The company would only pursue any product if we could keep the adverse effects to a minimum . That 's just good business . All right . Keep digging , let me know what you find . And Deb , good work . Thanks . My fiance ? They brought him in , in an ambulance ? Are you looking for Mr. Irving ? Yeah . He 's upstairs . I 'll take you to him . Hi , I 'm Deb , I 'm with a drug company that 's trying to help . Do you mind if I ask you a few questions about Karl ? Sure . That 's the last one . Give it a try . Uh ... It 's good . It 's good . It 's bad . Bad ! Whoa ! What 's wrong ? He got Harriet Tubman 's Thimble . Another bad thing ? Yeah , yeah , it lets you change your appearance into anyone . And ... Artie , I don 't speak mumble . What ? I 've got a twenty on Brother Adrian 's cell . Old mansion outside of Sturgis , supposed to be empty . All right , listen . This place is condemned and dangerous , so be careful . And remember . We take away whatever artifact he 's using to get into the Warehouse , we cut off his access . What 's this guy look like ? Well , look at the place . I mean , you see any other human being in there , it 's probably him . Alright . Earbuds on . You guys go around the back , I 'll take the front . Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Please be careful . Remember you 're falling on your face for two now . Oh , thanks for your concern . Who are you calling ? Hoping he didn 't leave it on vibrate . At least we know he 's here . Stop ! Hold it ! Artie ! Second floor , just above the back hall ! Damn it ! We lost him . Alright . I 'll come toward you , maybe we can trap him ! He was carrying a wooden plank , maybe a yard long . Oh , and old , with Roman lettering . Gotta be at least artifact adjacent ! This whole thing is giving me heartburn . Pete , if it 's not the pill , what if what they have in common is the symptom ? I mean , heartburn is caused by lifestyle . Stress , weight , eating habits . Do you still have those patient reports from Deb ? Yeah . These guys ? Yeah . Okay , um ... Right . Look . Each of these victims had a spike in their heartburn on the same night . A couple of days later , they ... They started to get taller . So what did they do on the 16th ? So , Barry organized all his receipts by date . Color me shocked . Here . On the 16th , he took a ... A cooking class , at a cooking school called Le Cordon Bend . He probably did it to meet girls . All right , well , here 's their website . Ah ! And lookee there , the class was taught by victim number five , Karl Irving . " Tastes of the Mediterranean . " Didn 't Lisa Bernardo say that she was trying a new recipe ? Moussaka ! They all took the same cooking class . Listen to this . " Karl 's specialty is exotic , spicy foods . " That explains why some of them were taking the heartburn pill . " And his passion is collecting authentic antique cooking tools from around the world , " which he uses in his classes . " Artifact jackpot ! This place has been cleaned out . But that doesn 't make any sense . Oh , no . It ... It does . I heard about it from the fiancee . Yeah , I cleaned the place out . I sent everything over to RD for study . Who knows ? Radiation , chemical coating . Maybe they can figure out a way to make this thing safe . Thanks , Gil . I have another stop to make . I 'll be in touch . That wooden plank might be the Threshold of Limentinus . The Roman god of thresholds , of course . Tell me about the plank . Well , when it 's placed at the base of anything , it creates an opening . That 's how he 's been breaking in . Keep ... Yeah , you keep digging , I 'll get back to you . Hi . Before you deny it , I know that Pete Lattimer lives here , I know he 's not strictly Secret Service , and I 've got about a million questions about that . May I come in ? Yes . Okay , thank you . Yup . Moorpark Pharmaceutical bought the whole school . Shipped it to Research and Development in Minneapolis . She used me . Yes . That 's kind of hot . Leena . Hi , guys . Uh , there 's a Deb Stanley here , who says she knows you ? And is asking all sorts of questions . Isn 't that interesting ? Oh , my God . This is , like , the worst one night stand ever . Okay ... Look , Mykes , I get a really good vibe off of her . And ... And I ... I think that ... That Deb truly believes that what she 's doing is right . So , I 'll just tell her that whatever she 's found , she has to give back or else people are gonna die . And ... And I think she 'll give it back . And how are you going to deny what we do and admit that a cooking utensil has the power to kill ? You are so smart . Look . We 'll just ... We 'll bag it faster if we go to Minneapolis . So , we 'll split up , okay ? I 'll go get the artifact , and you go home and clean up your mess . Or ... Or maybe you could talk to Deb ? Yeah , no , never mind . Please don 't still be there . Please don 't still be there . Please ! Um . The Secret Service doesn 't house their agents in quaint little bbs . Who are you ? Wait . How did you even find me here ? I pulled some strings . I got your travel records . Okay , a little stalkery . Look , I know I rocked your world , but you can 't just follow me home ! Oh ! Yeah . That 's why I 'm here . You 're gonna have to put a ring on it . Really ? No ! What ? Look . I found out that you guys were around a couple of years ago , when a wrestling team got buff , quick . Yeah . Another time , there were rumors some old ladies got miraculously younger . Things like this , they pop up on the radar when you 're in the business of finding new drugs . But every time I dug further , the stories got buried . And I think ... I think that you guys are the ones who buried them . Look , Deb . For your own safety , get out of here now . I work for some people that don 't like strangers asking questions . Are they gonna put a bullet in my head ? Maybe . Pete , I 've seen this movie before . Other people know I 'm here ! Look . My boss is already on his way . Oh , man ! Why am I so irresistible ? I know , Senator . I thought it was a myth too , but I have it from a very trusted source . I 'm on my way to the airport now . If this collection of objects does exist , the government has no right to suppress it . I mean , just think of the lost opportunity to help people and the lost revenue . Thank you . You and your fundraising committee won 't regret it . All right . See you there . Artie ! Where 've you been ? Yeah . Uh . Well , you know , I searched the whole cellar and nothing . Steve , the Thimble ! It 's not Artie , it 's him ! No ! No ! He didn 't have the plank with him . Well , maybe he stored it down here and he used that Thimble in case we saw him . Artie , can you read us ? We 're in the cellar . No . No . It 's ... It 's choppy . What were those shots ? Are you all right ? We think that Brother Adrian may have stashed the plank down here . But now he might be heading your way . He made himself look like you . Do you have it in you to shoot yourself , Agent Nielsen ? Wouldn 't be the first time . Finally , a little truth . Pete . I have been trying to make sense of these stories for years . Don 't shut me out now . Okay , look . Whatever you think you 're onto or whatever you think you saw , you 're wrong . Okay ? Urban legends . Modern folklore . Just go away . Agent Lattimer ? May I have a word ? A Senator who had no idea about the Warehouse yesterday is today calling the White House and asking about it . Oh , God . Mr. Kosan , I 'm so sorry . Ms. Stanley works for a company that has a great deal of influence . They are pressuring the Senator to grant them access to our facility . Well , can they do that ? Can 't Mrs. Frederic just make it go away ? Mrs. Frederic is on her way to Washington now , but there are no guarantees . The Warehouse has always had a delicate relationship with the government that hosts it . All right . Well , don 't the Regents have a plan for this sort of thing ? We do . It 's very messy , and borders on treason . Yeah . Maybe you don 't wanna go there just yet . There is an alternative , but it relies on you . Me ? Haven 't I done enough ? What do your vibes tell you ? That I 'm in a heap of trouble . Not about you . About her . Of course . Just think about it . Yeah , yeah . She 's ... She 's okay . She 's a good egg . Is she smart ? Yeah . She 's very smart . She 's almost Myka smart . Hmm . Then perhaps we need to consider another option . I can 't believe I 'm saying this , but welcome to Warehouse 13 . Artie does that a lot better . Try to breathe . I 'm calling 911 . Okay . I ... I 'm getting help , so just hang on . Uh . Everything 's gonna be fine . Trust me , okay ? I 'm the only one that can help him . Just tell me what he touched . Uh ... Everything but the chicken . How big is this place ? I have no idea . I have worked here for three years , and I have yet to see a wall . So ... How long has it been here ? Uh ... I don 't know . About 100 years . But ... But Warehouses like it have ... Have existed for way longer . I mean , like , since , like , Alexander the Great . It 's incredible . The things in here . I mean , you can ... We ... We could extend life . We could cure disease . You could end hunger and misery . Uh , yeah . The thing is , Deb , what you 're looking at , all of this stuff , I mean , it 's thousands of years of people doing the smartest thing they could do . And that 's locking it all away . Because it all has a downside and it 's usually pretty nasty . Everything has a downside . Come on ! Fire has a downside . We just had to learn how to control it . Yeah , but this can 't be controlled . I mean , it 's not science . Science isn 't science until it is ! Isaac Newton believed in the occult . Albert Einstein refused to accept quantum mechanics . We still don 't even know what all of our DNA does . Why is everyone so convinced that the age of great discovery is over ? Okay . This sounds like more than a drug exec talking . Why is this so important to you ? My dad had Parkinson 's . He was a brilliant man and his body betrayed him . In the end he couldn 't walk , he couldn 't speak . What if you 've got something in here that could help others like him , before it 's too late for them ? Okay , come on . I wanna show you something . This artifact could 've cured your dad . But to use it , you have to give the disease to someone else . This raincoat . It ... It boosts your immunity to the point that nothing can hurt you , but it turns you into a serial killer . Okay . So , we ... We don 't use those . It 's not that simple , Deb . Okay ? There are things here that ... That could wipe out a country . Or start a famine . I mean , how do we tell the world about some of it and keep the rest a secret ? I know your heart 's in the right place , but what about your boss ? I mean , will he always do the right thing ? I mean , isn 't his job to think about money first ? What if ... What if he has friends that ... That build weapons or wanna control governments for " all the right reasons " ? Will those guys always do the right thing ? Can you promise me that ? Can you take that risk ? He touched a lot of it . We ... We don 't have time for this ! Okay , just ... Just narrow it down for me ! Where was he standing last ? Uh ... He was standing at that batch ! " Rodos . " Rhodes ! People ... People growing ! The ... The Colossus ! He scraped the inside of that bowl for a surface sample . That must have sped up the effect . Just ... Just cover your eyes . What the hell was that ? It was nothing . Nothing at all . Just , um , you know , tell ... Tell your friend to drink a lot of water . Tell me , exactly , what the evil is that will be released . And maybe I can stop it . We 're gonna find the Threshold , you know . You 've gotten into the Warehouse for the last time . I have other artifacts . And I 'll keep using them until you restore the day you erased with the Astrolabe . You might wanna rethink that . If I restore the other timeline , you 'd be dead . Well , then ... That 's the natural order of things . I 've dedicated myself to eradicating evil and if sacrificing my life is what it takes , I 'm willing to do that . There . Artie , we found the Threshold . Gonna take us a minute to get to it . Oh ! Careful ! Got it . You 've spent your life containing evil . You know that I 'm right about this . I can see that you 're afraid of it . Don 't talk to me about my life . You know nothing about me . I know everything about you ! And I 'm going to keep dismantling your life until you comply . Erasing every good deed you ever did , isolating you from everyone you 've ever cared about ! Everyone I care about . Everyone I care about ! Claudia ! Steve ! Stop ! It 's a trap ! Don 't move ! Can you hear me ? Claudia ! Claudia ! Steve ! Breathe , Obi-wan . We heard you . We found a tripwire , so we tripped it . On purpose . Thanks for the heads up , Artie . Yeah . I ... I ... I was afraid that you were buried alive again . What ? Uh . What ? Again ? Why do you only listen to me when I don 't want you to ? Good . Thanks again for coming , Senator . This had better be worth it , Gil . I 'm missing two important votes on the floor . Oh , trust me , Don , you 'll be glad I showed you this . My associate assures me it 's a phenomenon . This way , gentlemen . Welcome to storage space six . This ? This is the secret government stash that 's gonna blow the lid off Washington ? If I were you , Gil , I 'd , uh , fire my associate and find someone who 's not gonna waste my time , and make you look like an idiot ! So , Myka says the artifact was a marble bowl . Looks like it was carved from the ruins of the Colossus of Rhodes . She also talked to the people at the hospital . I guess everybody there is okay . Good . Maybe one of them is hiring , ' cause I 'm pretty sure I just got myself fired . Yeah , sorry about that . So , what made you change your mind ? I mean , I ... Did I charm you again ? Or ... I saw the Rod of Asclepius down there . That 's the original , huh ? Oh , yeah . That baby almost took off my hand one time . It 's an interesting story . We were in Egypt . The Hippocratic Oath , you know , that 's my dad 's oath . " First , do no harm . " So , I think probably the best " no harm " I can do is to help keep this place secret . Ms. Stanley . Agent Lattimer , would you excuse us ? Oh , uh ... Yeah . Are ... Are you ... Are you gonna erase her memory ? If you don 't remember me , when you hear , " hey , hey , hey ... " Agent . Yes . Thank you for your assistance today . After I caused the whole problem . We 'll call it a learning curve . You don 't strike me as government issue . What is your part in all of this ? I 'm a member of what you might call a civilian oversight board . We 're known as the Regents . You 're the ones who decided to let me in on this today . We rely heavily on the input of our agents . Hmm . Pete 's a really good guy , you know . You should hang onto him . We intend to . When someone tries as hard as you did to find the Warehouse and then shows considerable wisdom in their actions , perhaps they are meant to be a part of what we do . Sometimes , that 's how we find new Regents . Might that interest you ? Yes . Yeah , mmm-hmm . Well . You know , uh ... It might , you know . Good . Then we 'll continue our discussions and time will tell . Put that down . Oh ! You were great . All right . So . The Big Bad Brother 's on the run , it 's time to apply pressure , right . Right . Now , he can 't get into the Warehouse anymore , but he 's still gonna come after ... Hold it , hold it . Hold it ! You were right , I was handling too much by myself . And I did need your help . So , thanks . That 's why we 're here . And here comes the ... But , there is still a part of this I can 't tell you . Because even knowing about it would put people in danger . So this is where your involvement ends . You are done . Understood ? But , Artie ... Okay . We 're not done , are we ? Not by a mile . I presumed you 'd rather we speak alone . You presumed right . Did you find the knife ? I have a few leads . There 's something we need to discuss first , something that 's been on my mind . What would that be ? When you pled on my behalf to the Regents , I understand you spoke with great certainty that I would lay down my life for the Warehouse . Yes , well . I 'm a good judge of character . Yes , you are . But are you also a good judge of wheelchairs ? You quite suddenly knew that Mr. Sykes had brought a bomb with him and precisely where it was hidden . Do you know how long I 've been doing this job ? I had an instinct . Artie , if there 's one subject I 'm rather a world-class expert on , it 's time travel . Bit of an unhealthy obsession once , really . And the more I 've thought about it , the more I 'm convinced it 's the only explanation for your behavior . No ... No ... No . No , it 's not . You knew things the rest of us couldn 't , because you 'd been ahead in time and come back again . You can 't tell anyone . I already have . Oh , my God , what have you done ? I 've shared my suspicions with Mrs. Frederic . Artie , I don 't know why you 've been keeping this a secret , but I believe you used Magellan 's Astrolabe . Anyone you tell will be in grave danger .

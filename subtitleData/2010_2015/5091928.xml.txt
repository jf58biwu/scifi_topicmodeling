 IRISA : The dreams returned last night . Stranger , more vivid than ever . I dreamt of his world , the world that used to be , before the Votans arrived . ( RATTLING ) ( LAUGHING ) Come on , let 's go ! Let 's go ! IRISA : I was born into the world that came after , after the vessels that carried my people were destroyed , after the Arkfalls began , after the terraformers changed his planet forever . The Earth he once knew was gone . Dead is the star system my people left behind . When I was a child , Nolan liked to tell me , " This world has no natives . " Which means it belongs to everyone . He says Antarctica will be paradise . I want to believe him , but I 've been disappointed too many times . I love my father , but his promises usually turn to shtako . So , is this the silent treatment or is this just a little more silent than usual ? Confused . Maybe you could give me a little hint . - ( BEEPS ) - You know , a nod , a twitch , breathe ? Yep , yep , yep . Matching approach vector . I see it . ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) Look , how was I supposed to know she was married ? It 's not like they wear rings or anything . It 's all weird alien pheromones and quite frankly , I wasn 't born with a nose for it . Never again . I will never again involve you in a compromising situation like that . I promise . ( SIGHS ) Projected impact in 20 clicks . ( ROARING ) Finally , a guaranteed payday . ( RADIO PLAYING ) ( SINGING ALONG ) NOLAN : Let 's see what we can salvage . - ( MONITOR BEEPS ) - We 're clear . Hundreds of years in space , only to die in their sleep . Come on . Oh , yeah , look at that terra-spire there , not even a dent . Looks intact . You got the whatsit ? Let 's see if we can jump-start this sucker . Bingo . What 's it worth ? Earth Republic pays top jaja for Votan Tech . Pristine terra-sphere like this , three million , easy . - So we 're rich ? - I think we 're rich . - We can pay off Varus ! - ( NOLAN LAUGHING ) With enough left over for passage to Antarctica . It 's gonna be you and me , kiddo , lying on a beach from now until the Arks rise again . ( LAUGHTER ) ( CLAMOURING ) Spirit Riders . You better stay ... At ease , friends . We don 't want trouble . Little one . Why do you partner with this human ? Why not ride with your own kind ? Because you people smell like shtako . ( CHUCKLES ) Such fire . You are Irathient to be sure . She 's just this human 's pet . Does he feed you little treats ? We 're cannibals . Why don 't you stay for dinner ? - ( GROWLING ) - Enough ! You . Outside . Okay . Go ! ( GROWLS ) Go ! Easy . Hey ! Hey ! Come on , guys . Ah . Very nice . Come on . Do you know what we went through to get that ? Oh , pretty , pretty . Hey ! Hey ! You don 't need my roller to survive , do you ? It 's a piece of crap anyway . Lousy mileage . Heater never worked . See ? Worthless . Worthless ! Empty your pack . Good stuff 's still inside the Ark . Empty it . ( SIGHS ) ( SCREAMING ) Irisa ! Let 's go ! Go ! ( GROANS ) What about our roller ? Forget the roller ! An Irathient to be sure . ( PANTING ) Come on , keep moving . There 's things in these woods we don 't wanna meet . ( PANTING ) Okay , there 's a settlement in this direction , all right ? I saw it on the scanner , but I don 't know how far . We should rest . No , keep going . ( PANTING ) ( GROANING ) Irisa , what 's wrong ? I was shot . Oh , come on ! Now , this is gonna hurt , okay ? - I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . - ( SCREAMING IN PAIN ) That 's my girl . Come on . ( PANTING ) ( ROARING IN DISTANCE ) ( ROARING CONTINUES ) ( GROWLING ) ( ROARING ) All right , big boy . Come on . Fuck me . ( GROWLING ) - ( GUNSHOTS FIRING ) - ( SCREECHING ) NOLAN : Be gentle with her . You 're safe with us . Drop the net . We 're coming in . MAN ON RADIO : Roger that . Stand by for entry protocol . That arch ? - Is this St Louis ? - Once . Now we call it " Defiance . " AMANDA : The end of the Pale Wars had a beginning . We all know the story . As the fort burned down around them , members of the human and Votan armies laid down their weapons . Their various commanding officers ordered them to keep fighting , but those soldiers , those Defiant Few , refused . Instead , they banded together to rescue trapped civilians from the wreckage . The power of that one seminal event galvanized the eight races . Word spread around the globe , others refused to fight . Fifteen years ago today , armistice was declared and the Pale Wars ended . ( ALL APPLAUDING ) ( CHEERING ) ( PEOPLE CHEERING ) AMANDA : In celebration of this event , I am proud to dedicate this statue and commence this year 's Armistice Day celebration ! ( APPLAUDING ) WOMAN : Yes ! That 's what we want ! That 's what we want ! Now , I have to thank some people . We all know this is only my third week on the job . This project was commissioned by my beloved predecessor , Mayor Nicolette Riordan . Ex-Mayor ! Ex-Mayor ! It took me eight years to quit this lousy job . You 're welcome to it . ( CROWD LAUGHING ) I also have to thank two benefactors whose generous financial support made today 's festivities possible . On my right , Mr Datak Tarr , his wife , Stahma , and their son , Alak . ( CROWD APPLAUDING ) And on my left , the owner of McCawley Mines , Rafe McCawley , and his children , Luke , Quentin and Christie . ( CROWD WHOOPING ) Applause means that much to you , does it ? You want applause , Datak ? Pack up and leave town . You 'll get a standing ovation . - Defiance ! - CROWD : Defiance ! ALL : Defiance ! Yeah ! ( CROWD WHOOPING ) Yeah ! ( BAND PLAYING ) ( SINGING IN ALIEN LANGUAGE ) Uh , okay , I might throw up . That was the worst , stilted ... Oh , balls . You were great . No , no . I am genetically incapable of inspiring people . Oh , balls . No balls . I 've been your assistant long enough to make the trains run on time , but that 's about it . Trust me , when I tell you that you 're a natural . I have an eye for talent , I do . - PHOTOGRAPHER : Hey , ladies ? - Thank you . ( CLICKS ) - All right . - Thank you . How long you gonna be in Cedars ? Oh , well , unfortunately I have a niece who insists on living there . Oh , Earth Republic has drained all the colour out of that place . It 's so regimented . People walk around like robots . There 's an E-Rep that 's been snooping around , willing to share resources . Oh , don 't buy it . Once they get their hooks into you , they never let go . Remember , grasshopper , around here , we value our freedom . " Grasshopper " ? Make me feel old , why don 't you ? ( MACHINES BEEPING ) ( DOOR OPENS ) - How are the patients ? - DOC : They 'll be fine . I 'm prepping the Irathient for surgery . And the human is trying to make us think that he 's unconscious . Ow ! Drink . You 're dehydrated . Thanks . Tommy . I told you to watch him , not cuff him . He was armed . Well , now he 's unarmed . See that patch on his shoulder ? If he really wanted to hurt you , those cuffs wouldn 't stop him . TOMMY : Come on , give me your wrist . Yeah . You took too long . I got bored . Ahem . My name 's Garret Clancy . I 'm the town lawkeeper . The kid is my deputy , Tommy LaSalle . That 's Doc Yewll over there . Nolan . My travelling companion there is Irisa . You served . Yeah . 31 st Division , Yellow Jackets . Jackets . You boys stayed in it ' til the end . Yeah . You were with the 9th , the Defiant Few . Defiance , yeah . Yeah , I know . This town is named after that battle . Every damn thing was named for that battle . ( CHUCKLES ) Too true . Come on , the Mayor wants to see you . - My travelling companion . - Go . She 'll be fine , but I 'm gonna have to clean and close this wound . Whoa ! Okay , bitch . Hand me that charge-blade or I will toss you out into the street . Now ! This is quite the party town you 've got here . Today 's a celebration day . The Mayor 's office is right up there . ( MUSIC PLAYING ) ( SINGING IN ALIEN LANGUAGE ) ( INDISTINCT TALKING ) DATAK : That smug shtako . He packed that audience with his own miners so he 'd get louder applause than me . What kind of a man does that , I ask you ? It 's juvenile . Petty . It 's beneath my contempt , really . You 're annoyed you didn 't think of it first . Well , that was unkind . You know what I noticed ? Despite Rafe McCawley 's efforts , the volume of his applause barely exceeded your own . That says something . It says my wife indulges in empty flattery . No , my flattery is filled with implied promise . Once we get home . Our son is out for the evening . Out ? Out where ? Alak 's not running with that gang . I warned him . He 's young . He 's pushing boundaries . Do not handle me , Stahma . Alak running wild reflects badly on this family . I 've worked too hard , done too many unpleasant things to achieve legitimacy and respect . I co-sponsored this event today . Datak Tarr of the Hollows , on stage next to the great Rafe McCawley , presented to these ... These humans as his peer . I do this so Alak can aspire to a better life than was available to me . ( BANDIK SPEAKING ) I 'm not late ! Mr Tarr ! I don 't want you to think I 'm late ! Gelik hasn 't come to collect ! Daddy ! Daddy ! Dear young ones ... I have so much of this ... Do you think you could possibly help me eat some ? - ( GROWLING ) - Ah ! Someone will come . You approach me personally like this again and I 'll break more than your hand . ( GRUNTS ) You see ? I do these things , endure these painful encounters , so our son never has to . This is my gift . When Alak rebuffs it , he breaks his father 's heart . - I will talk to him . - See that you do . I don 't want to have to speak of this again . ( DOG BARKING ) BEN : Mayor Nicky departed on the ground coach as scheduled and a driver dropped off a proposal from Ambassador Tenetty . - And ? - Apparently , Earth Republic is offering to replenish our anti-viral meds , along with the fuel rods for our Vo-Tech weapons , in exchange for a mutual securities pact that she says would ... Denied . Okay . The Ark hunter who came in with the wounded I-rath is still outside . Any idea where she came from ? If she was abducted we could have some trouble with the Spirit Riders . Now , Yewll didn 't see any tribal markings . Apparently he fought with the 9th . He 's one of the Defiant Few . That was a long time ago . I 'm more interested in what he 's been up to lately . Send him in . She 's ready for you . Madame Mayor . We 're not that formal around here . Please , call me Amanda . Single malt ? Where 'd you find that ? Traded with some scavengers . They were using it to strip paint or something . Mmm . So , my lawkeepers told me that they found you and the Irathient girl outside the stasis net , nearly dead . Is she some sort of bounty ? Your partner ? Your lover ? We 're just two people passing through . Irathients and humans , they don 't have the best relations in this area . I don 't want any trouble with the Spirit Riders . - If she was abducted , then ... - She 's my daughter . Your daughter ? She seems pureblood . War orphan . Found her abandoned in what used to be Denver . She was in a bad situation . I rescued her and raised her , - she 's a good girl . - ( CHUCKLES ) That 's why she nearly cut my doctor 's throat ? Like I said , she 's a good girl . Now , your lawkeeper , he took away my weapon . Just doing his job . Yeah . Nevertheless , I 'd really like it back now . - You feel me ? - Hmm . You don 't look like the kind of guy to put down roots . Are you looking to put down roots ? I am not . Well , then , this becomes an easy conversation . Doc Yewll will patch up your daughter . Grab a drink at the NeedWant while you wait . One you pay for . When she 's healed , our lawkeepers will escort you to the nets . They 'll give you back your gun and send you both on your way . Yeah . The Spirit Riders cleaned us out , got our roller , our heavy weapons , all our supplies . We were lucky to get away with the scrip in our pockets . So , in order to leave , we need to earn . And you 're saying you 're incapable of earning without a weapon . - It does present a challenge . - Hmm . You know , the brothel is always looking for fresh faces . And a big handsome guy like you , ( EXHALES ) I bet you 'd clean up . You feel me ? ( SINGING IN ALIEN LANGUAGE ) You want to dance ? I dance like a human . I 'm better off just watching . " Life is coy and must be firmly embraced . ' It 's an old Casti proverb . It means ... " Seize the day . ' Fine . Better not laugh at my moves . I would never do that . What the fuck ? I don 't let haints touch my sister . I don 't remember asking . Luke , leave him alone ! You 're a dead man . Alak , don 't . He 's drunk . This 'll be over quick . Don 't do this , Luke . Not here . Uh ! Stop it ! Both of you ! Alak , stop , don 't do this ! Put it down ! Quentin , get him out of here . Now ! Don 't cut yourself with that knife ! You 're the one I 'm gonna cut ! CHRISTIE : Alak . I don 't believe you 're dumb enough to mix it up with that kid . You know who his dad is . Those people are dangerous . Doesn 't it piss you off ? Our sister is hanging out with these haints ! - If Dad found out ... - Dad 's not gonna find out . ( HAILER BEEPS ) Now give me the tag , I 'll drive . Catch a ride with Christie , okay ? I 've gotta be somewhere . Where you going ? I have an appointment . What 's going on , Luke ? You keep disappearing at all hours . What have you got going ? I 'll be home for dinner , okay ? You do nice work , Doc . Appreciate the compliment . Also appreciate prompt payment . Yeah . Uh . See , we were robbed . I know I 've got something around here . Keep it in your pants . Buy the girl a meal . You 'll pay me when you can . Thanks , Doc . Thanks . Can we go ? Friggin ' deadbeats . I don 't like towns . We should leave . We 're not headed into the Storm Divide on foot . We need wheels . So we sell the terra-sphere . ( SHUSHING ) No , no . Not here . That thing is like a loose nuke . If they catch us with it , they 'll string us up . So , what 's your plan ? We quietly earn , buy a new roller and dig up the sphere on the way out of town . Hey , big boy . Yeah , maybe later . You sure ? - Come on , Kenya . Let 's go . - " Let 's go " ? Rupert , what do I look like to you ? I work hard to make this brothel a warm and inviting environment for my employees and my clientele . I look after the Dig-baa tree , I 've painted the walls and I even taught myself how to sew so I could make those curtains over there . And you come in , stinking of the mine . Sorry . Well , it 's insulting and disrespectful . So , come here . Why don 't you go back to your quarters . I want you to shower and shave and then you can put on a decent shirt . And then in the unlikely event that I 'm not otherwise engaged , we can revisit your desire to conduct some sex business . Go . ( KENYA GIGGLING ) Get the hell out of here . Gulanite miners . You gotta train ' em , ya know ? You 're new in town ? How can you tell ? Because I haven 't seen you before , and if I haven 't seen you before , it means that you are new in town . Lucky you ! You just walked into the NeedWant , which is the best party on this side of the Storm Divide . My name 's Kenya . Nolan . And this is Irisa . - Umm . - Um . So , Kenya , where can a fella go around here to earn some money ? Slow money or fast money ? - Fast money . - Go to the Hollows . What 's in the Hollows ? You 'll see . ( CROWD SCREAMING ) I 'm starting to like this place . IRISA : This is a bad idea . Relax , it 'll be just like Kansas City . You got knifed in Kansas City . This is a completely different situation . Ah ! Oh ! Winner ! Who 's next ? Which one of you have the skills and the stones to take on our house champion , at 10-to-1 odds ? I 'm in . You 're on ! 10-to-1 odds for the stranger with the gyaan-du-ra ! You get some side bets going . I 'll carry this bum as long as I can . You 're an idiot . - I know . - MAN : He 's dead ! The house exercises its right to substitute a new champion . You want me to fight a Bio-man ? And if you quit , you forfeit your stake . ( CROWD CLAMOURING ) Let 's do it . Yeah ! Come on ! Come on ! ( CRICKETS CHIRPING ) ( DOG BARKING ) Good boy , Tito . ( INDISTINCT TALKING ) LUKE : Ah ! No ! Please ! ( TITO BARKING ) Tito ! Come back ! Tito ? ( WHIMPERING ) Oh , no . Oh , no . I just need your signature on the plans for the new well there and there . ( SIGHS ) Generations come and go , but paperwork abides . ( CHUCKLES ) - There you go . - Thank you . You okay ? Yeah . Uh , there 's a reason why Indogenes shouldn 't play Casti 12-ball . Tried running up a wall . Now I got a cramp that won 't quit . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Madame Mayor . Clancy , how long have we known each other ? Please , it 's Amanda . You better come with me , Amanda . Okay , folks , you heard the man . 10-to-1 on the new guy . - ( GRUNTS ) - Oh ! ( CROWD CHEERING ) ( GROANS ) How much longer are you gonna carry him ? Oh , I 'm just getting warmed up . ( GRUNTS ) Oh . Oh ! - Oh . - ( CROWD GROANING ) Ooh . Nothing personal . Ah ! Ooh . ( GRUNTS ) PROMOTER : Winner ! So , what took you so long ? Oh , I forgot where they put the off switch on the 2037 models . All right , I 'll go find us a decent roller . You get us some supplies and I 'll meet you at the NeedWant . ( CLAPPING ) Congratulations on an exciting match . My pleasure . I am Datak Tarr . I have an interest in this establishment , along with many others here in the Hollows . You 've deactivated my Bio-man . Temporarily . Put a few thousand volts through him , he 'll be right as rain . I 'm afraid your actions amount to what you humans once called a " low blow . " As such , it 's a violation of our house rules . You mean your rules . We Castithans have a saying , " The fruit of a misdeed leaves a sour taste . " Easy . For your trouble . Not enough for a roller , is it ? Nope . But it is enough for a bath and a change of clothes . ( GASPS ) ( SONG PLAYING ) QUENTIN : Now that I 've got that new hopper online , we 'll be able to increase our capacity by 60 cubic yards a minute . Good . Lord knows we need all we can get . Very impressive , Quentin . You 're late , little one . Sorry . I was at the festival . I lost track of time . Yeah . Have you seen your brother ? No . I haven 't . Wonder where the hell he is . Well , he said he 'd be home for dinner . BERTIE : He 's a grown man . Just eat . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Looks good , Bertie . Is it a relative of yours ? ( SOFTLY ) Dad . Hey , Dad , look at this . Check out the new specs on this hopper . All you guys ever do is talk about work . We should take a vacation . - Vacation ? - ( DOORBELL CHIMES ) What would I do on a vacation ? Don 't everyone get up at once . That 's why you get the big bucks . ( CHUCKLES ) DOC : He suffered a puncture to the right kidney , probably from a knife . But what killed him was a Votan weapon . These are cold-fire burns . He was murdered . Whoever did this , we 'll find him . No ! I 'll find him . QUENTIN : Dad . You know something ? Talk to me , son . There was a fight . Luke and ... Who ? He threatened to kill him . I said who ? Alak Tarr . CLANCY : Rafe , I 'll handle this . Let Clancy do his job . If it 's the Tarr boy , he 'll be tried and punished . Clancy , I love you like a brother , but do not get in my way . Find the Tarr boy first . ( INDISTINCT TALKING ) ( KENYA GIGGLING ) That was so fantastic . - Hmm . - I kinda hate to charge you for it . I kinda hate to pay for it . ( DOOR OPENS ) You ! Get up . Why would I go anywhere with you , Grandpa ? Don 't make me repeat myself . Up . Now ! Who 's the kid ? That is Datak 's son , Alak . You gonna sit there and pretend like you don 't know ? You murdered Luke ! I gotta get down there . Luke 's dead ? Yes . Look , we got in a fight , but Luke left right after . I came inside to gamble . My crew has been with me this whole time . - I can 't believe anything ... - Rafe ! ... these little peckerheads say . Now get up before I drag your narrow ass outta that chair . You have to let Clancy handle this . Back off , Kenya . Out of the chair ! - Look , if you touch me , my father ... - Ah ! Your father will get the same . Hey , kid , thanks for keeping my seat warm . Who the hell are you ? I 've just been gambling with this young Casti bonehead here . He 's into me for 200 scrip and I 'd just as soon not break up a winning streak . So if you can postpone your lynching till after I collect my money , I 'd appreciate it . ( GRUNTS ) Sorry . He startled me . ( SIGHS ) Nobody 's getting lynched , friend . We just want to ask this kid some questions . Yeah , well , it seems to me you 've got everything here except the rope . Or is that holding up your pants ? Hak , get rid of him . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) My friend here , she 's got a thing for edged weapons . Bottles , knives . Your broken teeth would do in a pinch . CHRISTIE : Stop ! - Daddy , don 't do anything stupid ! - You 've got the wrong guy . Like hell I do . Alak didn 't hurt Luke ! He couldn 't have ! Go on , tell him what you told me . Christie , don 't do this . Alak was with me all night , right until I came home for dinner . ( SIGHS ) Daddy , no ! Daddy , no ! Ah ! Oh ! CHRISTIE : No ! He 's dead . The lawkeeper 's dead . I want to know what you plan to do about this animal ! Datak , let me handle this . He tried to murder my son ! Your son 's been screwing my daughter ! I 'll screw you with my knife ! Stop it , both of you ! If you 'd hurt Alak , it would be you lying on that floor . Datak , go home to your wife and son . I 'd never get his stink off my blade anyway . Oh , sure , them , you let carry weapons . Shut up . You 're responsible for this , too . We need to concentrate on finding Luke 's killer before the trail goes cold . What trail ? Who 'd follow it anyway now that Clancy 's dead ? TOMMY : I 'll do it . You ? Yeah , me . I gotta be honest with you , son , you 're no Clancy . You don 't have the skills or the balls to do what 's gotta be done . - I 'll find the bastard myself . - No . No way . You almost killed an innocent kid . - We need a professional . - We don 't have a professional ! Yeah , you do . I 'm a tracker by trade . Are you now ? Yeah , I am . You 're looking at the guy who brought in the Miami bomber , and presented Starren Dahrti with the head of his sister 's murderer . I 'll find your killer for the right price . It 's not a bad idea , Rafe . Starren Dahrti 's sister is alive and hates your guts . Details . Shh . He 's one of the Defiant Few . All right , tracker . You find my son 's killer , with proof , mind you , and I 'll pay you 20 K. Twenty-five . I don 't believe I heard you right . - Twenty 's good . - On one condition . If you do find the killer , he stays alive so he can stand trial . Are we clear ? Agreed . All right . Your companion stays with my deputy . - What ? You don 't trust me ? - ( CHUCKLES ) I am fresh out of trust tonight . Lock her up . I wouldn 't recommend the handcuffs . He 's not getting away with this . Of course not . I 'm going to gather up some chang-o and pay Rafe McCawley a visit , pay his whole family a visit . STAHMA : Datak . Our son is in love with the McCawley girl . Well , we 'll see how he loves a corpse . She 's innocent in all this . I remind you , she risked her father 's wrath to clear Alak 's name . I will have justice . There are many roads to justice . Would it not be something , when all this has blown over , of course , if Alak and Christie actually got married ? Are you trying to ruin my bath ? I have little interest in being in-law to Rafe McCawley . If Christie were in the family , she would feel comfortable coming to us for anything . Dear , her father can give her anything she wants . - You 're right . - Hmm . He works very hard . It 's such a dangerous job , don 't you think ? God forbid anything should ever happen to Rafe or Quentin . Christie 's already lost so much . She 'd be left with so much to take care of . - The mines . - Yes . The mines . If she were family , we 'd be forced to help her . Well , it is our job to help our family . ( CHUCKLES ) I appreciate how you see things . Do you appreciate when I do this ? ( SIGHS ) ( WHISPERS ) I think a wedding is exactly what this town needs . You 're just gonna sit there all day without talking ? You know what you are ? You are very , very disconcerting . You know that ? Okay , whatever . As long as we 're both trapped here , we might as well eat something . I 'm not trapped in here . If I wanted , I could have grabbed your wrist , broken every finger on your hand , taken the key card to this cell which you left hanging from your belt . Before you knew what was happening , I 'd already be out of this cage and separating your head from the rest of you with one of my blades . What is wrong with you ? You wanted conversation . That 's conversation ? You know , I think you 're mad and you 're taking out your anger on me . I 'm not mad . I don 't believe you . I think you 're angry that your scavenger friend left you here . What is it with you and that Nolan guy anyway ? Fine . He saved me . What ? You heard . Yeah . You know , it was kinda like that with me and Clancy . I was on a bad path , but Clancy saw something in me . He gave me a second chance . How about you ? What did Nolan do to save you ? Something I couldn 't do for myself . Which was ? He murdered my parents . This is good . RAFE : What 's taking so long ? Hey , Nolan ? When are you gonna show us why you 're such a famous tracker ? Well , before we try and figure out where he went , it might help to figure out what happened here . The site 's been pretty badly trampled down . But it appears that we got two separate sets of prints arriving from two different directions , which suggests that Luke and his killer didn 't come out here together to duke it out . They arrived separately , maybe for a meeting , one they didn 't want to have in town . Well , that 's a whole lot of assumptions . It 's more like deductions , but I don 't wanna quibble . Now , an argument breaks out , like our dog walker says he heard . Then a fight . Excuse me . Luke is stabbed . Maybe then the killer loses the knife , which is why he pulls out the cold-fire weapon . Only now , Luke 's got a weapon , too . ( GRUNTS ) That 's not human blood . No ! Wait ! Okay , all right . So , this is the trail he left when he ran off , right ? Now , you see ? The prints on the right are crisp . We can almost read the boot prints . But the ones on the left are dragging . They never quite break the ground . So , if he was cut , but he didn 't bleed ... Cybernetic implant . We 're looking for an Indogene , one with a bad left leg . Ben , my assistant . He is Indogene , and last night , he told me he had hurt his leg . Where 's Ben now ? Hey , Ben . The Mayor wanted me to run some diagnostics past the big brains up top . Here , check this out . ( BEEPS ) Do you have a visual on the heat signature over the next ridge ? Arkfall ? Bigger . Much bigger . Tell them to check it out . Volge ! Holy fuck . Volge ! Ah ! Turn around ! Go ! Go ! ( HAILER BUZZING ) Hey , boss . What can I do for you ? Where are you ? Oh , just handling a few personal errands . You at the office ? I 'm on my way . I 've got to prepare for the vidcon with Ara Shondu . BEN : Yeah . The revised specs for the Mag-Lev are on the side table under the geo reports . Great . Thanks . Amanda ? Do you hear that humming ? He 's at the stasis net . Amanda ? Sorry , my hailer slipped . You know . What are you talking about ? It 's in your voice . I know you better than anybody . I didn 't have a choice . The town is finished . All you can do now is run . Rafe ? Rafe , get your men to the stasis net now ! Rafe ! Shtako . ( BOTH GRUNT ) - Uh ! Come on , you 're losing him ! - No , I 'm not . - Hurry up ! - You 're welcome to walk , sweetheart . Did you just call me sweetheart ? It was my second choice . Ah ! ( PANTING ) Get down ! - Is that son of a bitch still alive ? - Wait ! Wait , wait ! No ! Hey , stop ! No ! Hey , we need him alive . All right ? Why did you kill Luke ? No choice . He was gonna talk , ruin everything . - You 're lying ! - Hey ! You see this cold-fire gun ? I recognise the design . It 's an Omac alloy . There 's only one Votan race that uses these , and it 's not Indogene , is it , Ben ? Now , I know that you 're in a lot of pain , but I need you to focus . Speak ! ( GROANING ) Everybody needs to leave . All of you . They 're coming , now . They 're planning to attack right after dark . What kind of attack ? What are you talking about ? - Hey ! - Ah ! Stay with me . Is it them ? Are you talking about the ... RAFE : What the hell is going on ? The Volge . NOLAN : I fought ' em during the Pale Wars . Without the stasis net , Defiance doesn 't stand a chance . MAN : ( OVER PA ) All townspeople gather at Darby Square in 10 minutes for an important address from Mayor Rosewater . All townspeople gather at Darby Square in 10 minutes for an important address from Mayor Rosewater . MAN : He 's already gone ! Hi . Um . You should come by , before you leave town , for one last visit , okay ? And I 'll give you a discount . Half price . WOMAN : She 's still packin ' up . Don 't start . You need to eat . Oh , I can 't . I 've got to go out there and convince people to fight an enemy bred to wipe out planets . We have no idea why they 're attacking , and the guy with the answers is in a coma . I 'm in over my head . You can do this . You always rise to the occasion , no matter how tough the odds are . You 're sweet . I 'm right . Well , right now all I 've got is a bunch of words on a page that sound like a bunch of words on a page . Look , Nicky would 've ... No ! You are not Nicky . Don 't give a speech . Just talk to them . TOMMY : Amanda ? The town 's waiting . Hey . I 'm proud to be your sister . You two are sisters ? Yeah , why ? No reason . By now , you all know a saboteur has destroyed the stasis nets . ( ALL MURMURING ) What about the Volge ? MAN : Yeah , what about the Volge ? There 's an army coming , Paul . I 'm not going to pretend there isn 't . Where 's Mayor Nicky ? - The question is , what are we gonna ... - ( CLAMOURING ) Yeah , where 's the real Mayor ? - We need somebody with experience here ! - WOMAN : Your assistant tried to kill us ! Please , folks , just let the Mayor speak . Please ! Just let the Mayor speak ! - We 're all gonna die ! - ( FEEDBACK CRACKLING ) That 's right . That 's what you believe , isn 't it ? So why not just pack up all your belongings and take a chance in the Badlands ? Because this town is done . Paul . Three years ago , you lost two sons and half your farm to razor rain . It was a terrible tragedy , and yet , you 're still here . Rupert . How many good men did you lose when the 99'ers collapsed the South Tunnel ? Six . And have you ever once thought of quitting , leaving town , finding a safer job ? No , ma 'am . We all have our stories . And we 've endured a lot . Raiders , epidemics , floods . But we 're still standing . Just like that big-ass arch up there . We live in a great place , a town where human and Votan races live together as equals . We strive for the best , but sometimes , we fall short , sometimes we forget ourselves . And occasionally , this new world rears up and kicks us in the teeth . But we stay . We fight . Because this town is worth fighting for . And if necessary , it 's worth dying for . Now , I 'm gonna stand up to what 's coming , and I 'm gonna drive them out . And I hope that each and every one of you stands with me , because we are stronger together ! The McCawleys stand with you ! ( SCATTERED APPLAUSE ) So does the house of Tarr . The vig on all debts is forgiven for every man who fights in the battle ! - Yeah ! - Yeah ! ( CHEERING ) ( WHISTLING ) These people are brave . So they 'll die with honour . You know , sometimes , you can be very cold . You 're still here , I see . Thought you would have taken the reward money and run . Not without that . Not to worry , though . We 'll be out of your hair in no time . Guess you 've got a lot to do out there in the Badlands . I promised my companion we 'd head south , to the beaches in Antarctica . - They say it 's paradise . - Mmm . I 'm pretty sure that 's a myth . Still , I 'd like to see for myself . Yeah , I never did get a chance to ask you about the big battle , what it was like being a hero , one of the Defiant Few . It was what it was . I wish you strength , Amanda . Enjoy your reward . Let 's get out of here . Yeah . Good idea . CHRISTIE : Stay close together , everyone . QUENTIN : Come on , guys . Right inside . Single file . CHRISTIE : Now let 's go . Keep walking . Keep walking . QUENTIN : Kids , come on , hurry up . Let 's go . Okay , hold on . ( ENGINE REVVING ) ( DISTANT RUMBLING ) We got out of there just in time . Oh , shtako . They 're headed straight for Defiance . I make it about seven clicks . They should hit Bissel Pass just after sunset . Let 's put some distance between us . We could make a difference . They 've got Indogenes in that town . They could work up a Burkus rig for this sphere , focus the energy , create a weapon the Volge wouldn 't even see coming . We 'd burn out the sphere . We 'd be left with nothing . Yeah , I know . I 'm sorry . But some things , they just need to be done . - You 're doing it again . - No , kiddo . Don 't ! Every time we get ahead , you blow it for us . This is different . - There are kids in this town . - I don 't care . Little kids . And , yes , you do care ! Don 't you say that to me , okay ? I know you better than that , and I raised you better than that . Go ahead . Get killed . Hey , I 've got no intention of dying today . Most people don 't . It still happens . Well , where are you gonna go ? Antarctica . I 'd send you a postcard , but I know you 've already got one . ( WIND HOWLING ) - What does it look like ? - A nightmare . Who 's that down there ? Nolan ! What are you doing here ? Saving your ass , sweetheart ! The terra-sphere has enough energy to wipe out the Volge . Doc Yewll will need to configure it to focus the blast . Once it 's online , we 've got to hold the Volge in the pass until we can blow the terra-sphere . How hard can that be ? My thought exactly . Nolan . Yeah . Thanks for coming back . Hey , Doc , how are you doing up there ? If you rush me , we all go boom . If you yell at me , we all go boom . Now you know how I 'm doing up here . You all know what you need to do . Hold your fire until you get the order . We have a superior position up here . But the Volge are climbers . So just keep pushing them to the centre of the pass . That 's where the blast will be focused , at the bottom of the canyon . The terra-sphere will obliterate anything in its path . When you get the signal , take cover or you 'll get caught in the blast . ( POWERING UP ) Ten minutes ! MAN : Ten minutes . - You ready ? - Mmm-hmm . Fire ! Up to the ridges ! Don 't let ' em climb ! Don 't let ' em climb ! I don 't like the look of that scaffolding ! ( BEEPING ) Knock it down ! ( BEEPING ) I need more time ! ( ROARING ) Ah ! ( GASPS ) You shtako-coward ! Amanda ! ( CHEERING ) ( YELLING ) ( SCREAMING ) MAN : Clear the area ! Go ! Get back ! Move ! Move ! Move ! Get back ! Come on ! Back ! Everybody back ! ( ROARING ) - Yeah ! - ( ALL CHEERING ) Yeah ! Yes ! Medic ! - The Mayor 's been shot . - MAN : Get a stretcher . Dress her wound . I see you made some new friends . I figured they hate the Volge more than they hate humans . I 'm still mad about the sphere . - I 'll make it up to you . - I 've heard that before . AMANDA : I have to get up . KENYA : No . AMANDA : Yes . KENYA : No , no , no , no . You don 't feel well . You have to stay here . You have to stay here . Doc , can you please talk some sense into her ? - Bed rest . - I know you mean well , but I have a few thousand things that I need to take care ... Bed rest . Good human . I 'm gonna check in with you later , okay ? - Okay . Bye . - Bye . - So , you 're gonna make it ? - ( CHUCKLES ) I think so . How many dead ? Forty-one . ( SIGHS ) Someone tried to wipe this town off the map last night . They tried hard . We need to figure out who sent the Volge and what they were trying to accomplish . Look , in the desk , in the drawer . There 's a cloth bag . AMANDA : What do you think ? - I 'm no lawkeeper . - Maybe not . But you happen to be all I have available . Way to sell a guy . Think about it . This town , it 's a nice place to live . Yep . So I keep hearing . ( SPEAKING IN ALIEN DIALECT ) " Life is coy and must be firmly embraced . ' It 's gorgeous . The ring signifies a pledge of betrothal ? It is the human custom . The actual wedding comes later . That 's when they will swear vows before Shigustak . This will kill Rafe McCawley . Eventually , yes . If we 're clever and patient . I married well . You flatter a poor woman . IRISA : Nolan used to say the two of us are children of the Badlands . The wild , open spaces where the weak are afraid to go . It 's towns that scare me . All the people jostling for space . Sucking up the air until there 's nothing left to breathe . Will we stay here ? I don 't know . My people have a god called Irzu . He has a path for each of us . Where it takes us is not always where we imagined . But there is a reason . Nolan 's people call it fate . ( PIANO PLAYING ) So while you were away , everything went to hell . Your new mayor is tougher than anyone expected . Ben Daris is comatose . But if he wakes up , he can tie us to the Volge attack and to Luke McCawley 's murder . And with McCawley dead , we have no idea where the Kaziri is buried or where he may have hidden the key . I don 't know what to do next . Relax , Mr Birch . Don 't lose heart . When the town is empty , we 'll be free to resume our search . The backup plan ? It 's brutal . ( LAUGHS ) We 're trying to change the world , Mr Birch . Mark my words , one day , the survivors will thank us .

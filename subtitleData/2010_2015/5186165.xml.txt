 13 Bannerman Road is where Sarah Jane Smith lives . And it 's home to things way beyond your imagination . There 's an extra-terrestrial super computer in the wall , her son , a genetically engineered boy genius , a schoolgirl investigator across the road and a whole universe of adventure , right here on the doorstep . Ready ? Always . The Doctor is dead . UNIT will take charge of the funeral , in conjunction with the Shansheeth . It 's Jo Grant . It 's a long time since I 've been called that . Smelly getting closer . No , no , no , no ! Closer and closer . It 's Shansheeth ! This whole thing 's a trap ! Space ... is ... taken ! Gosh . That was different . Hello , everyone ! Who are you ? Doctor ! Ah , the Claw Shansheeth of the 15th Funeral Fleet ! I 've been looking for you . Rest in peace ! MECHANICAL PULSING Sounds like a countdown . But I was on a planet ... No , no , never mind that - run ! Faster , faster , faster ! Come along , Smith ! No , no , no , don 't slow down ! Take me back ! In ! In ! In ! In ! In ! I 'm sorry , is there a problem ? Sorry , I was ... slamming it . Right ! Now we need to lock it . Come on , use the sonic lipstick . Haven 't you got the screwdriver ? ! They took it . Wow , they do sonic lipsticks now . We 're running out of time . I need you , Sarah , and you , Jo . Need us for what ? Remember the old days when we 'd go zooming off to faraway worlds ? I 'm getting space-sick ! No , no , no , let 's get you working properly . Stop , stop , stop ! Where are we ? The Wasteland of the Crimson Heart . PULSING STOPS Planet Earth 's that way . Bit of a long walk . Sonic , please ! Wow ! Oh , so many years since I was on another planet . Me too . Think about it . The Doctor 's been avoiding her , but why ? Because someone inside UNIT had to fake the DNA results . Colonel Karim . She 's in league with the Shansheeth ! Not as daft as they look , for two batty old pensioners and a bunch of ASBO kids . How on earth did they summon the Doctor ? They have powers unforeseen . Right . First things first . We need to clear this place , seal it off and keep that lot trapped ! Do you see ? We 're slap-bang in the middle of the base . There 's got to be a way of getting help . SIREN WAILS What 's happening ? Karim 's sealed off the entire Funeral Wing . We 're trapped ! Hurry , hurry ! Follow me ! Dispense with the coffin . Prepare this room for the coalescence ! Behold . The Memory Weave is ready . Soon it will be active . Deliver the women into our wings , and not even the Doctor will able to stop the crusade of the Shansheeth ! There ... And there ... Did it hurt ? Nah . I mean , the regeneration . That last body of yours . Was he OK , in the end ? It always hurts . And there . So how did you end up in this place ? The Shansheeth lured me . Mighty old battlefield , just begging to be explored . Cos I 'm travelling with Amy now , and Rory . They got married , so I dropped them off at a honeymoon planet , which isn 't what you 'd think . It 's not a planet FOR a honeymoon , it 's a planet ON a honeymoon , it married an asteroid . Then they nicked the Tardis . The Shansheeth , not Amy and , uh ... Fortunately , I had all this wreckage , to build a space swapping doo-dah thingummy wotsit . So you 've a married couple in the Tardis ? Mr and Mrs Pond ! I only left you because I got married . Did you think I was stupid ? Why do you say that ? Well , I was a bit dumb . Still am , I suppose . Now what in the world would make you think that ? Ever , ever , ever ? We 'd been travelling down the Amazon for months , and we reached a village in Cristalino , and it was the only place in thousands of miles that had a telephone , so I called you . I just wanted to say hello . And they told me that you 'd left , left UNIT , never came back . So I waited , and waited . Because you said you 'd see me again . You did , I asked you and you said yes , you promised . So I thought , oh , one day , I 'd hear that sound . Deep in the jungle , I 'd hear that funny wheezing noise , and a big blue box , right in the middle of the rainforest . Cos he wouldn 't just leave . Not forever . Not me . I 've waited my whole silly life ... Oh , but you 're an idiot . Well , there we have it ! No , but don 't you see ? How could I ever find you ? You 've spent the past forty years living in huts , climbing up trees , tearing down barricades . You 've done everything from flying kites on Kilimanjaro to sailing down the Yangtze in a tea chest . Not even the Tardis could pin you down ! Hold on , I did sail down the Yangtze in a tea chest ! How did you know ? And that family ! All seven kids , twelve grandchildren , thirteenth on his way . He 's dyslexic but that 'll be fine , great swimmer . So you 've been watching me ? All this time ? No . Because you 're right , I don 't look back . I can 't . But the last time I was dying , I looked back on all of you . Every single one . And I was so proud . It really is you , isn 't it ? Hello . BLOWS WHISTLE Sorry , but we 've got that lot back at home with the Shansheeth ! Yes ! And I still need you , Jo . Now , that bag of yours , I can smell blackcurrant . Is it buchu oil ? Hand-picked in Mozambique ! Oh , perfect ! These circuits need connectivity . Wonderful ! Little tiddly drop ... That 's it ! What a team ! Hurry , hurry , hurry ! Come on ! Hey , nice , you 've got a little den . What 's all the hurry for ? Pizza , go cold . What ? I thought you had a plan ! Shansheeth too scary ! We hide ! No , we 've got to do something ! Yeah , but hiding 's not bad , cos we 've got to keep you safe , Clyde . See , whatever the Doctor 's doing , he needs you for that body-switcheroo . Oh , great , great . Stuck in Groskeville . Pizza good . I can 't believe you get to do this all the time . Like aliens and chases and stuff ! You can talk , Santiago . You 're off to Paraguay and Mount Everest . Dude , you just zapped into another planet ! Yeah , that was pretty cool ! Yeah , we 've been to parallel times , dream dimensions , limbo . And then we go home for tea ! Yeah , we see all this , then my mum 's like , " What did you do today ? " I 'm like , " Not much . " Yeah - " Went to the library ! " " Played a bit of footie ! " " Stayed behind after Drama Club ! " " Oh , yeah , and I fought off a platoon of Judoon in my spare time ! " I 've not seen my mum for six months now . How come ? She 's in Japan , organising a rally . I mean , that 's great , really good work . Yeah , course . Before , she was in Africa , finding shell-flower plants . My father 's with the Gay Dads Organisation , hiking across Antarctica . We haven 't all been together since about ... February ? When are you going to see them next ? Soon . I don 't know . Soon though . What 's that ? What 's happening ? ! Trapped ! Excellent . We 've got the Brady Bunch exactly where we need them . Now to apply a little heat . COMPUTER : 'Internal vents to maximum . ' Heating ! Hot , hot , hot ! They 're trying to boil us ! And increasing ... The children are irrelevant . Not to the Doctor , they 're not . Wherever he is , he 'll be planning revenge . We need to divert him . It won 't budge ! Come on , Groske , there 's got to be a way out ! No ! We die like rotisserie ! Well , you can , but I 'm not ! Sarah Jane ? ! Anyone ? ! Doctor ? ! Where are you ? ! There ! That should work . Intergalactic molecular streaming , with just a hint of blackcurrant . But what 'll happen to Clyde ? No , no , I 've fixed it . All I needed was you two . Oil and sonic . Now we can go back , and Clyde can stay where he is . Hold tight ! Get us out of here ! Sarah Jane ! Doctor ! Oops . Then again , maybe leaving Clyde in the same place wasn 't such a good idea . Look out , stand back . Ah , ventilation shafts ! That takes me back . Or even forwards . Hurry up ! We 're getting boiled alive ! Hold on ! We 're coming ! Don 't worry , Santiago , I 'm here ! You go first , you 've got the sonic lip ... Aaargh ! Doctor ! Jo ? Sarah ? They 're roasting us ! Let us out ! Sarah ? Exactly as predicted . Given the choice between saving the world , or saving the children , the Doctor goes the wrong way . Oh , I didn 't trust you , Colonel , from the moment I met you . Like I care . Frankly , I 've never met anyone so staggeringly pious in all my life . Now then . The chamber 's sealed off . The Doctor would need half a ton of dynamite to get through that . The Tardis ! I never thought I 'd see it again . That 's what this is all about . The Tardis , and you . Place them in the Memory Weave . And ... release . Blimey . You really have changed faces , haven 't you ? I couldn 't see you before , I was too busy swapping . Oi , we 're still cooking back here ! Where 's my gran ? ! Right , yes , sorry ... Um , she 's in danger , so , we 'd better ... Uh , can 't turn round . You 'll have to shuffle backwards . Oh , yes , OK . Thank you , Clyde . Even your eyes are different . It 's weird , cos I thought the eyes would stay the same . Can you change colour or are you always white ? No , I could be anything . And is there a limit ? I mean , how many times can you change ? 507 . Oh . Well , come on then . Tell us ! What exactly does a Memory Weave do ? Cos I warn you , darling , the memory 's going at my age . You need remember only one thing . And what 's that ? The Tardis key . The Weave takes the memory out of your head , and makes it real . This device can build a physical key out of your thoughts . And then , we will have access to the Tardis . The most miraculous machine in creation will be ours ! No ! MECHANICAL GROAN They 've started . No , you can 't ! Ow ! We have seen so much of death . The Shansheeth have presided over infinite funerals . We see the pain and the suffering , again and again and again . But with the Tardis , we can stop this ! We can intervene to prevent the loss of life , on a universal scale . You 're going to stop death ? ! It is a noble quest . To halt the endless , endless weeping . And change the whole of history ! That 's why creatures like you can 't have time machines . Because you 'll wreck the entire universe ! What did I say ? Pious ! Oh , yeah ? I 'd rather be pious than vile . What do you get out of this , Colonel ? A bigger horizon , Miss Smith . The Shansheeth can take me to the stars , because there is nothing left for me here on Earth . Not any more . Accelerate the Weave ! Urgh ! Aaaargh ! They 've sealed it off ! Jo ! Sarah ! Can you hear me ? They want the key ! They 've got the Tardis , and a Memory Weave ! Too late . Full activation ! Concentrate ! Think of the key ! Try to find a way in ! There 's nothing . We need a bulldozer . I 've got the original here . You can have it if you let them go ! You let the Doctor inside this room and he will destroy us . Keep going ! Think of the Tardis ! The key . Remember the key ! Fight it ! Try to think of something else ! I can 't ! Neither can I ! It 's not shifting ! The memories coalesce ! The key ! It takes shape . Don 't ! Don 't ! I can 't ... stop ! What do we do , Doctor ? ! What do we do ? ! Yes . Because ... The Shansheeth are making them remember ... I know ! Then don 't you see ? I don 't see anything ! We do the same . Opening comms . Sarah , Jo ? Can you hear me ? The key ! It 's almost ready ! Listen to me . Both of you . I want you to remember . We are doing ! That 's the trouble ! No , no , no , no , no . I want you to remember everything . Every single day with me . Every single second . What 's he doing ? Your memories are more powerful than anything else on this planet . Just think of it , Sarah . Remember it , Jo . But properly ! Properly ! Give the Memory Weave everything . Every planet . Every face . Every madman , every loss , every sunset , every scent , every terror , every joy . Every Doctor . Every me . I remember ! No ! Memory Weave overloading ! I remember ! We need that key ! What is happening ? What 's happening ? COMPUTER : ' Initial target lost . ' The device is overloading ! Too many memories ! Too many ! Reverse it ! Bring that key back ! Come on , all of you , tell them , tell them ! Think of us , Sarah Jane . Remember Maria and her dad , and all the stuff we did , like the Gorgon . And the clowns , and the zodiac ! And the Mona Lisa ! All of it . All of it ! Just think , Gran ! All the countries you 've been to ! Every country in the world . COMPUTER : 'Weave starting to self-destruct . ' It 's blown a circuit ! I can 't get out ! I 've got you ! Now we 're in trouble . The Weave 's going to blow up and we can 't get them out . What ? ! Can 't escape ! I need the key ! COMPUTER : ' Weave now entering detonation phase ! ' I can 't unseal the doors ! The power line is gone ! We 've drained it . Doctor ! Doctor ! I can 't get out ! I can 't open it . No sonic screwdriver . It 's inside the Tardis . And we can 't get in , cos guess what ? We stopped ourselves getting the key . Oh , that was clever ( ! ) I just want to say , I 'm so glad I saw you again . I waited all this time . And it was worth it . Every second . Funny thing is though , your funeral turns out to be ours instead . My funeral ? Doctor , all of you , look after Luke for me , please ! No , no , no , no . But listen . My funeral . Don 't you see ? It 's my funeral ! With a lead-lined coffin ! Yes ! How much time have they got ? Big bang , ten seconds ! Come on . 10 , 9 ... COMPUTER : ' Total destruction imminent . ' .. 7,6,5 ... Hurry up , Gran ! .. 4 , 3 ... Wait for me ! .. 2 , 1 ... Nooooooo ! COUGHING AND SPLUTTERING What do you mean , the Mona Lisa ? Yum . Smells like roast chicken . Now then . Smith and Jones . The coffin was the trap . The coffin was the solution . That 's so neat , I could write a thesis . Well , come on , then , you two . Out you get . MR SMITH : ' Attention ! Temporal flux escalating in this vicinity ! 'The Tardis has landed . ' Woah ! It 's Bannerman Road ! It 's like everything moved . I 'm never getting used to that . Mr Smith , you 're in big trouble ! Those Shansheeth were bad ! 'It transpires , Rani , that you encountered a rogue element , 'and the Wide Wing of the High Shansheeth Nest sends apologies . ' No way . On top of everything else , you 've got a talking computer ? That is it ! I 'm giving up ! Still the same old Tardis . It doesn 't matter what 's changed , it still smells the same . No ! I 've got to say goodbye , or else I 'd stay with you forever . Besides , I probably couldn 't keep up any more . Get you into trouble with the Time Lords . Yeah , I 'd probably better go . You know me , stuff to do . It 's daft , though , because we were both saying , we had this theory . That if you ever died , we 'd feel it , somehow we 'd just know . But that 's just silly , isn 't it ? I don 't know . Maybe not . Cos between you and me , if that day ever comes , I think the whole universe might just shiver . Whoo ! Aaah ! Ha-ha ! Oh , but you should see Japan . It 's amazing . It 's like 80 % forest . It goes on as far as the eye can see . It 's endless . It 's exactly like you said ! You live over there , and you 're ... Just down there , on the left . You save the world , then you just come home . Maybe you could do with a bit of that . See , we 're fighting the Slitheen and the Trickster and you 're fighting oil barons and factories , but at the end of the day , who 's waiting for you ? I think you should start another protest , mate . Except this time , at your mum and dad . Or they might find that relations with Santiago get decidedly ' Chile ' . Let 's pretend I never said that . That was horrific . I 'm ashamed of myself . You 're right , though . Yeah . I think it 's time we made some changes . Oh , you . You 're so beautiful and so gorgeous . And you , oh , you are so willowy ! Yes , you are . Do you know , you are sensational . And you , you are so handsome , and we 're so late . Come on ! We 're off to Norway by hovercraft . Should be fun . Easier said than done . Bye , everyone . Oh , Sarah Jane . Find yourself a fellow ! Oh ... Hang on , wait a minute , glasses . Where did I leave my glasses ? What ? Oh ... Head , naturally . Bye . See you later . See you , guys . Do you think there 's lots of Jo Grants out there ? You know , like the Doctor 's old companions ? I do a little search sometimes . What do you google ? " Tardis " ? Hey , it works . Well , no , I can 't be sure , but there 's a woman called Tegan , in Australia , fighting for Aboriginal rights . There 's a Ben and Polly , in India , running an orphanage there . There was Harry . Oh , I loved Harry . He was a doctor . He did such good work with vaccines , he saved thousands of lives . Oh , and there 's a Dorothy something , she runs that company , A Charitable Earth . She 's raised billions . And this couple in Cambridge , both professors , Ian and Barbara Chesterton . Rumour has it , they 've never aged , not since the ' 60s . I wonder . That will be us , one day . Still out there , fighting . Echoes of the Doctor , all over the world . With friends like us , he 's never going to die , is he ? Hello ? Hello ? ! What 's happened ? Where 's Sarah Jane ? Where 's everybody ? ! It 's the whole world . Everybody 's gone ! What about Mr Smith ? He 's gone blank , like he 's not even in there any more . What if it 's just the two of us left in the whole wide world ? There ! What is that ? It 's on every screen !

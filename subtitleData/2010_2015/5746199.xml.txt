 Previously on " the 100 " ... Bellamy : Argh ! Clarke : Bellamy , stop . He deserves to die . No . We don 't decide who lives and dies . We banish him . I think we got off to a rough start , But we want to find a way to live together . You started a war that you don 't know how to end . There 's grounders in the trees . Clarke , run ! Run ! [ gunfire ] Don 't stop till you get behind your walls . Go . Take her . Finn : Well , if we weren 't at war already , We sure as hell are now . Bellamy : The exodus ship ? Ha ! Wait . Something is wrong . [ explosion ] Oh ... Clarke shouldn 't be out here . Her mom was on the ship . She 's looking for answers . You want to help her , find me the black box , Hard drives , anything that will explain Why the ship crashed . Bellamy : Stay sharp . Grounder retaliation for what happened On the bridge is coming , just a matter of when . Can you blame them ? No . I blame you . Maybe if you didn 't bring guns- - Raven : If we didn 't bring guns , we all would 've been killed . Bellamy : Why they 're coming doesn 't matter anymore . It 's our job to be ready when they do . We 're on our own now . Oh ! Clarke , stop ! Rocket fuel ? Hydrazine ... Highly unstable in its nonsolid form . If this stuff meets fire , We 're all pink mist . Fire in the hole ! [ explosion ] We need to clear the area . Ok , then . We move in formation , no straggling , weapons hot . We got to get back before dark . Hey . No sign of your brothers or the others yet ? Hey . I don 't care . Harper : Jasper , tell us again , how 'd you stay so calm ? I would 've been terrified . Fear is only a problem If you let it stop you , right ? That 's not even his line . Finn said that . Jasper : I saw the grounders in the trees . It was like nothing I ever felt . Pure animal instinct took over . One pull of the trigger , two grounders dead . " pure animal instinct " ? More like pure pants-wetting panic . Jasper : You don 't really know what you 're made of Until a moment like that when it 's kill or be killed And there 's just nothing between you and the tip of the spear . Ok . This has to stop . Come on . Let us have this . " us " ? Look at him . The boy is a folk hero . They even gave us a bigger tent . [ clattering ] Connor : Somebody hit the trip wire ! Woman : Which wire ? Was it a grounder ? Man : I don 't see anything . Different man : Are you sure it was the trip wire ? Derek : I got nothing . Connor ? Nothing . Man : Something moved . There , there , there ! [ gunshots ] Think I got him . Let 's go . Lincoln . Connor : Hey , slow down . Connor : Octavia , be careful . Connor : Oh , my god . Derek : No way . Murphy ? Where is he ? Bellamy : Everyone but connor and derek out ... Now ! Derek : He claims he was with the grounders . We caught him trying to sneak back into camp . I wasn 't sneaking . I was running from the grounders . Anyone see grounders ? Uh-uh . Well , in that case- - Hey , what the hell is wrong with you ? We were clear what would happen if he came back . No . If he was with the grounders , Then he knows things that can help us . Help us ? We hanged him . We banished him , and now we 're gonna kill him . Get the hell out of my way . No . Finn is right . Like hell , he is . Clarke , think about charlotte . I am thinking about her , But what happened to charlotte Was as much our fault as his . Clarke : He 's not lying . His fingernails were torn off . They tortured him . You and the grounders should compare notes . The grounders know we 're at war . What did you tell them about us ? Everything . Once he 's better , we find out what he knows , And then he 's out of here , ok ? What if he refuses to leave ? What do we do with him then ? Then we kill him . Hey , jasper , you 're on in 15 . In case you 're hungry . Thanks . Be right out . I like your tent . Maybe I could come by after your shift , Hear about the bridge again . Um ... I 'm actually busy later . Oh . Yeah . Ok . Some other time , then . See you . Are you kidding me ? That was there for the taking . Harper ? She 's low-hanging fruit . Don 't tell me you 're still Holding out for octavia . I got to go . Jasper , octavia is not gonna happen . She likes her grounders alive . Go float yourself , monty . I 'm just telling you the truth . No . You 're telling me your truth . I 'm not like you anymore . What the hell does that mean ? It means you 're jealous , And people think I 'm cool , and that upsets you . I think you 're cool , Only no one had to die for me to see it . You know what ? This is my tent , ok ? Bellamy gave it to me , and if you have A problem with that , Maybe you should find somewhere else to sleep . Maybe I should . Then do it . I will . Good . [ static ] Oh . Sorry . I didn 't know anyone was in here . You ok ? Yeah . Still nothing from the ark . It 's like they shut it down from their side . It could be solar flares blocking the signal . But you don 't think so . I got a bad feeling . There 's a lot of that going around . Clarke , wait . I 'm sorry about your mom . Oh , my god , clarke , your eyes . Connor : Clarke ! Where 's clarke ? [ coughs ] Clarke ... Connor ? It won 't stop . Clarke ... [ coughing ] What 's happening ? [ man coughing ] Woman : You ok ? Raven , get away from us . They 're the ones who brought murphy in . [ coughing ] Murphy , hey , look at me . I need you to tell me exactly How you escaped from the grounders . What happened ? I don 't know . I woke up , and they forgot to lock my cage . There we no one there , so I took off . They let you go . Bellamy , stay back . Did he do something to you ? What the hell is this ? Biological warfare . You were waiting for the grounders To retaliate for the bridge ? This is it . Murphy is the weapon . Is this your revenge , Helping the grounders kill us ? I didn 't know about this , ok , I swear . Stop lying . When are they coming ? Murphy , think , all right ? What can you tell us that 's useful ? Did you hear anything ? They are vicious , cruel . You want to see vicious ? Hey , don 't . Whatever this thing is , it spreads through contact . Finn : Clarke ? Finn , you shouldn 't be in here . No one should . I heard you were sick . Clarke , what is this ? I don 't know , Some kind of hemorrhagic fever . We just need to contain it before- - [ retching ] Hey , don 't touch me . You could get sick . Wash your hands now . Oh , oh ! What the hell is happening to him ? I don 't know . [ coughing ] [ coughing stops ] Is he- - He 's dead . Here . Alcohol . Hold out your hand . What do we do ? Quarantine . Round up everyone who had contact with murphy . Bring them here . And everyone they had contact with ? Well , we have to start somewhere . Connor , who as with you when you found him ? Who carried him in ? Think . The first one there was octavia . Jee- - Jeez , you scared me . How are you feeling ? Fine . Get out . You touch murphy yesterday ? What ? Did you touch murphy yesterday ? I don 't know . I guess so . Why ? The grounders sent him here with a virus to infect us . Derek just died from it , Another mark for your boyfriend 's book . Get up . Clarke needs to examine you . [ coughing ] Ok . We 're done . No visible signs of swelling or bleeding . So you 're saying she doesn 't have it ? I 'm saying she doesn 't have symptoms , But that could change . We need to keep her here just in case . No way . Look at this place . She 'll get sick just being here . Do you want to stop the spread , or not ? Look . I 'll keep her on the third level With the people who aren 't symptomatic yet . Think of it as a way to stop her From sneaking out again . Screw you , clarke . I 'll let you know if her condition changes . Octavia , wait . I need you to sneak out again . Octavia : Lincoln ? Lincoln . You knew . I tried to get you out of there . You not see the flower ? I saw it ... Right before I found the kid your people Sent to infect us . People are dying , lincoln . Clarke sent me here for the cure . There is no cure . So you were just gonna let my people die ? You were gonna let me die ? The sickness passes quickly . We use it to soften the battlefield . I am not surprised You are one of the strong ones . The battlefield ? They attack at first light . You 're gonna have to help me save them . I can 't . I tried . My people think I 'm a traitor now . Because of the bridge ? You were just trying to make peace . It 's not the bridge . Because of me ? Oh . That doesn 't matter now . I 'm leaving , octavia , right now . I want you to come with me . And go where ? East to the sea , then across it . There 's a clan , allies of the woods . They 'll take us . I can 't just let my brother get killed . There is nothing you can do to stop that now . I can warn them . Octavia , they 'll kill you . If you 're there at dawn- - I won 't be . Just wait for me here . I 'm coming with you . Wait . Bellamy : All right . Show is over . Get back to your posts . You got enough food in there , water ? Yeah . Some medicine might be nice . I 'll see what I can do . Octavia , you ok ? Bellamy , wait . She 's not here . I sent her to see lincoln . Look . If there 's a cure , he has it . I didn 't tell you Because I knew you wouldn 't let her go . If anything happens to her , You and me are gonna have problems . Bellamy ... Bellamy ! Out of my way . Dude , your eyes . Nobody touch him ! Bellamy : Get to the dropship now . Hey , are you ok ? Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh , my god . Oh , my god , it 's on me . Woman : Get away ! Get back ! Get back ! Calm down . Finn : Put that gun down . Put that gun down . Put it down ! [ gunshots ] This is exactly what the grounders want . Don 't you see that ? They don 't have to kill us if we kill each other first . They won 't have to kill us If we all catch the virus . Get back in the damn dropship . Oh ! Not to state the obvious , But your quarantine isn 't working . Finn , don 't touch her . Clarke : Hey , let me go . I 'm ok . No , you 're not . Octavia will come back with a cure . Octavia : There is no cure ... But the grounders don 't use the sickness to kill . Really ? Tell that to them . I warned you about seeing that grounder again . Yeah ? Well , I have a warning for you , too . The grounders are coming ... [ all murmuring ] And they 're attacking at first light . I 'll help you get clarke into the dropship . How many bullets can you make by first light ? What do I have to do to stop you from coming in here ? Get better . Octavia : If he 's not sick by now , Then he 's probably immune like me . Murphy : Here . Come on . She can take mine . What else did lincoln tell you ? The virus doesn 't last long . Murphy : It 's true . I feel better . They need to stay hydrated . You need to stay hydrated . Ok . Them , too . Please ? It 's ok . I 'll do it . Just rest . Murphy : I 'll help you . You need to save yourselves . Just leave camp . Take anyone healthy enough with you . If you think that 's even a possibility , You don 't know me very well . I know you . Murphy : Look . At this rate , when the grounders get here , There won 't be anyone left to fight back . That 's the point . Then we slow them down . Bellamy : There 's 5 to a clip . Let 's go . We need to get these guns on the wall . We 're running out of gunpowder . Oh , we 're so dead . Don 't worry . I got your back . Huh . Got something to say ? Raven : Hey , guys , stay focused . We 're doing good . We need as many rounds done by dawn as we can . It won 't matter if there 's no one left Who can shoot . What do we need to build a bomb ? Depends on what you 're trying to blow up . How about a bridge ? What are you talking about ? Murphy says he crossed a bridge On his way back here from the grounders ' camp . Sound familiar ? Yeah . So what ? So the virus is fast . He 's already getting better . Blowing the bridge won 't stop the attack , But the longer we can delay it , The more of us will be able to fight . Even if murphy is telling the truth- - And that 's a big if- - that bridge has survived A nuclear war and 97 years of weather . It won 't survive me . Please don 't let me blow up . Ok . You can come in now . Boom ! That 's cute . Relax . It needs an accelerant- - Gunpowder . Container of hydrazine . Put the gunpowder around the hydrazine . Hit the bull 's-eye ... Win a prize . Bellamy : It 's the rest of our gunpowder . Won 't be able to make any more bullets . Tonight we need a bomb . We can worry about bullets tomorrow . If we do this and it doesn 't work , We 'll all be dead tomorrow . Then let 's make sure it works . To be safe , you need to be at least 200 feet away To make the shot . No problem . Which one of you plants the bomb ? I will . You won 't pick up a gun , but blowing people up , That you 're ok with ? We 're blowing up a bridge . There 's not gonna be any people on it . Finn , we have one bomb . We need to use it to kill As many of those bastards as possible . But they don 't know we only have one bomb . If we did , why would we waste it on the bridge ? I 'm talking about deterrents , Peace through strength . The appearance of strength , you mean . Yeah . Men who built the a-bomb Thought they were peacemakers , too . How 'd that work out for them ? Don 't touch anything . Who else can take a shot ? Appreciate the concern . Make sure the bomb is packed and ready to go in 10 minutes . Jasper , come here . Hi . You need me to go with you to the bridge again ? Stay back . I need you to take the shot . Yeah . I can do that . Don 't you have jobs to do ? If you miss , If that bridge doesn 't blow , We 're all dead . You got that ? Hey , why me ? I mean , you 've got 20 shooters . I 'm the only one not sick , right ? Right . Don 't miss . Bellamy ! No . Stay back . Make the shot . Find finn . Go . Hey , don 't get stand there . Get him into the dropship . Sure . [ connor coughing ] Hey , murphy ... Yeah ? Clarke says when that happens to roll him on his side . I 'm on it . Come on . Come on . Get on your side . You 're ok . You 're ok , all right ? I got you . Ok . Ok . Just breathe . Just breathe . All right . Listen to me . You and me are good . All right . Just breathe . That 's better . I put the rope around your neck . Why are you helping me ? Bygones . [ bellamy coughing ] Bell ? No . Clear some space . Lay him down . Oh , no . Bell ... Hey , big brother . I 'm scared . I won 't let anything happen to you , I promise . That 's what I said to you the day you were born . I know . You told me that , like , 1,000 times . I 'm glad you 're here . Just get some rest now , ok ? Hey , finn . It 's gone . Monty , where 's raven ? She left a while ago . The bomb . She 's planting it herself . You want to come ? Why don 't you ask your new friends ? Finn : Jasper , let 's go . Uh ! Ah ... Ah , thank god . Here . Get the hell away from me . Bellamy , you 're sick , ok ? I 'm just trying to help . Here . When I get better , if you 're still here- - Clarke : Hey , I got this one . Yeah . Here . You feeling better ? Yeah . That 's good . You seen octavia ? She was up all night helping people . Murphy gave her a break . Don 't tell me you trust him now . Trust ? No . I do believe in second chances , though . It 's almost dawn . Better get everyone inside . If we lock the doors , maybe the grounders Will think we 're not home . Not everyone is sick . Sick is better than dead . You don 't think finn and jasper are gonna pull it off . Do you ? I 'll get everyone inside . [ panting ] Thank god . So simple . You can do this . [ drums playing ] Do you hear that ? War drums . Oh , we 're running toward the war drums ? Oh , I hate this plan . Raven ! She 's still building the bomb . Hey , finn , wait . No . She 's got this . No . Jasper : Raven get out of there now ! Line up the shot . Finn : Raven ! Hey , ok . Come on . Come on . Is the bomb ready ? Yeah . Shoot , jasper ! Shoot ! Shoot ! [ gunshots ] [ click click ] Oh , damn it . Damn it . You call that shooting ? Monty ? Last time was a fluke . I panicked . So what ? You still made the shot , right ? Twice . How many rounds ? 3 . You got this . Damn it . Come on . Did you not hear me say you got this ? They did it . I am become death , destroyer of worlds . It 's oppenheimer , The man who built the first- - I know who oppenheimer is . We had to stop the attack . Look . There is so much you don 't understand . The mountain men , they 'll come , and they 'll kill us all . We have to get out of here while we still got the chance . The mountain men ? You mean , the drawings in your book ? Yeah . Now let 's go . We got a lot of ground to cover before dark . I 'm not going with you . [ music playing ] You 'll die here . Maybe . Why ? You just said it . They 're my people . I 'm sorry . Good-bye , lincoln . There ! It 's them ! Open the gate . [ cheering and applause ] Don 't let it get to your head . Ha ha ! Woman : Whoo ! Whoo ! Yes ! [ man coughs ] She 's getting stronger . Hey . Hey . You saved my life . Wouldn 't have had to if you didn 't take the bomb . You hesitated . What ? When bellamy asked who was gonna take it , You hesitated . It 's what people do when they 're considering Something that might blow them up , right ? You didn 't hesitate when clarke was falling . You knew she had the virus , but you caught her , anyway . Raven- - you didn 't hesitate . Raven , I love you . Not the way that I want to be loved . Not the way that you love clarke . It 's over , finn . You 're outside of the wall without a gun . 14 graves . We need to talk about murphy . He was right about the bridge . We 'll see . Octavia says the mountain men are pissed , Whatever that means . I 'd say it means we need as many soldiers as we can get . So , what , we have pardon power now ? It 's hard running things . 14 .

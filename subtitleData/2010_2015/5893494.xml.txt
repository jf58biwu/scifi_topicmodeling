 CLARKE : I was born in space . I 've never felt the sun on my face or breathed real air , or floated in the water . Ripped By mstoll ( YELLING ) None of us have . For three generations , the Ark has kept what 's left of the human race alive , but now our home is dying , and we are the last hope of mankind . One hundred prisoners sent on a desperate mission to the ground . Each of us is here because we broke the law . On the ground , there is no law . All we have to do is survive . But we will be tested , by the Earth , by the secrets it hides , and most of alt , by each other . MAN : Previously on The 100 ... MAN : Prisoner 319 , take off the watch . No . It was my father 's . - Mom ? - You 're being sent to the ground . Clarke , I 'm sorry I got your father arrested . They didn 't arrest my father , Wells . They executed him . Atom , my sister doesn 't leave this camp . Anyone who touches her , they answer to me . BELLAMY : Atom . CLARKE : Jasper was hit . They took him . He 's alive . ( SPORTS GAME ON RADIO ) There we go . ( CLAPPING ) JAKE : Feel that ? Feel that ? - Here comes the momentum change . - Defense . The defense is there . - Serve it up . - Yeah ! Right here , kid . - They 're unbeatable . - Prepare for crushing defeat . It 's not over yet . Actually , it was over 147 years ago . A technicality . Give it up . You 're going down . What 'd I miss ? Your husband and daughter being obnoxious . ABBY : Better play nice . WELLS : Come on , get down the field . Waste of time . Waste ... hey , baby . Hi . I ran into Bennett when I was leaving the clinic and he has that systems analysis that you asked for . ( WELLS LAUGHS ) - This isn 't gonna last . - WELLS : What was that about momentum ? WELLS : Oh , I feel the momentum . - What ? You 're going now ? - Just for a few minutes . - Everything okay ? - Oh , yeah . You know this old boat . It 's always something . ( Moms ) His pulse is thready . ( GASPS , GROANS ) BOY : Shut that kid up ! BOY : Quiet ! Don 't listen to them . CLARKE : You 're gonna make it through this , okay ? Promise . BOY : Can he just die already ? CLARKE : I 'm gonna get clean water . Keep an eye on him . ( JASPER MOANS ) GIRL ( SCREAMING ) : No ! No ! No ! No ! Hey , wake up . It 's okay . It 's okay . CLARKE : It 's just a dream . You 're Charlotte , right ? I 'm Clarke . It 's okay to be scared . Do you want to talk about it ? It 's ... my parents . They were floated and they ... I see it in my dreams and I just ... I understand . My dad was floated , too . So , how did you end up here ? Well ... they were taking my parents ' things to the redistribution center and I kind of lost ii . They said I assaulted a guard . I can 't say I blame you . See that bright star up there ? That 's the Ark orbiting above us . I think whatever happened up there , you know , the pain maybe we can move past that now . CLARKE : Maybe being on the ground is our second chance . Do you really believe that ? I 'm trying to . I think this is north . Come on . Really ? Because we just came from that way , Miss I-Can-Navigate-With-The-Stars . It 's your fault we 've been lost for two days . Never should 've gone off by ourselves . Come on . We 'll find the dropship tomorrow . That 's what you said last night . And I 'm hungry . Trina , relax . We 're fine . Did you feel that ? ( HIGH PITCHED WHISTLING ) What is that ? I don 't know . I don 't know . TRINA : I can 't see ! - PASCAL : Let 's get out of here . - TRINA : Oh , my God , it burns ! ( BOTH SCREAMING ) ( JASPER MOANS ) That damn kid , always messing with my head . He 's not gonna last much longer . Better think of a new excuse . BELLAMY : That 's how it 's done . We searched a half-mile all directions . No sign of Trina or Pascal . Visit your special tree when you were out there ? Atom took his punishment . Let it go . Could be Grounders . Yeah , or they could be in pound town . A lot of that going around recently . ( MOANING CONTINUES ) Look , Bellamy , people are scared , and that dying kid , he 's not helping the morale around here . Morale will go up when I find them more food . And what do we say when they ask about Trina and Pascal ? Now ? Nothing . It 's possible they 're just lost . We 'll keep an eye out for them when we go hunting later . Let 's go kill something . You 're not going . I need you to stay here . If the Grounders are circling , we can 't leave this place unprotected . Fine . Somebody better tell goggle boy to keep it shut . - ( MOANING ) - ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) ( JASPER MOANS ) The Grounders cauterized the wound . Saved his life . Saved his life so they could string him up for live bait . Garden of Eden this ain 't . This is infected . He could be septic . Any progress on using the wristbands to contact the Ark ? CLARKE : Monty ? That would be a firm no . My mother would know what to do . How 's he doing ? How does it look like he 's doing , Wells ? Hey , I 'm just trying to help . ( GASPING , MOANING ) Right . You want to help ? Hold him down . ( MOANING CONTINUES ) I 'm not gonna like this , am I ? ( MOANING ) Hey . I could really use a break from this place . What do you say you and me take a trip to the butterfly field ? Huh ? Am I being too subtle ? Atom . - OCTAVIA : With weapons ... - What did you do to Atom ? Atom 's fine . Then why did he blow me off ? Maybe he 's just not interested . You can 't keep everyone away from me . Atom had to learn . You disobey me , you pay the price . He paid the price . Now we 're good . Now I 'm paying the price . So , next time you decide to go on , a power trip , leave me out of it . ( JASPER SCREAMS ) Hold him still . CLARKE : I need to cut away the infected flesh . Stop it ! You 're killing him . She 's trying to save his life . She can 't . Back off . We didn 't drag him through miles of woods just to let him die . Kid 's a goner . If you can 't see that , you 're deluded . BELLAMY : He 's making people crazy . Sorry if Jasper 's an inconvenience to you , but this isn 't the Ark . Down here , every life matters . Take a look at him . He 's a lost cause . Octavia , I 've spent my whole life watching my mother heal people . If I say there 's hope , there 's hope . This isn 't about hope , it 's about guts . You don 't have the guts to make the hard choices . I do . He 's been like this for three days . If he 's not better by tomorrow , I 'll kill him myself . Octavia , let 's go . I 'm staying here . Power-hungry , self-serving jackass . He doesn 't care about anyone but himself . No offense . Yeah . Bellamy is all that . But he also happens to be right . How 'd it go ? Hey . Well , I told Jaha it 's definitive . The Ark 's got a year of oxygen left , maybe two . You 'll fix it . Not this time . JAKE : I 've tried , Abby . This isn 't a glitch . It 's a system failure . People need to know . No . They 'll panic . - You sound like Kane . - Because he 's right . No . We can 't avoid the truth . We have to let everyone on the Ark put their minds to a solution . What , and risk anarchy ? No. it 's too dangerous . Promise me that you 'll obey the council 's orders , that you 'll keep it quiet . Promise me . I can 't . For Clarke . Do it for Clarke . I am doing this for Clarke . They 'll float you , Jake . ABBY : If you do this , I won 't be able to stop it . ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACH ) You 're mad . I 'm not mad . You want to think Jasper 's a lost cause , go ahead . - You 're wrong . - I hope I am . Whatever this stuff is , it has to have had antibiotic properties . Let me take a look . Before you refuse my help , remember who aced botany in Earth skills . The Grounders used it as a poultice . I 'm thinking a tea might be even more effective if we can figure out what it is . I know what it is . Seaweed . Look , no root structure . Well , then there must be a water source nearby . WELLS : Yeah , it would have to have a slow current , lots of rocks . The water would probably be more red than green . I know just the place . All right . Let 's go . Hey . I know what this stuff looks like . Do you ? You know , you should , uh , really rethink this whole hating me thing . It 's not just the Grounders . We 're surrounded by criminals . We need each other . WELLS : We 're gonna be friends again . You got my dad killed . Not possible . This is Earth , Clarke . Anything 's possible . FINN : I 'd let it go . WELLS : Yeah . Well , I 've known Clarke her whole life better than you ever will , so , I 'll decide when to let it go . Yeah , I can tell you guys are close . ( BANGING ) What is it ? - It 's an automobile . - CLARKE : Come on , guys . This thing 's been here 100 years . All right ? It can wait . Jasper can 't . ( OINKING ) ( SHUSHING ) BELLAMY : She 's mine . ( TWIG CRACKS ) ( PIG GRUNTS ) BOY : Get her . ( PIG SQUEALING ) Who the hell are you ? Charlotte . I almost killed you . Why aren 't you back at camp ? What with that guy who was dying , I just ... I couldn 't listen anymore . There 's Grounders out here . It 's too dangerous for a little girl . I 'm not little . Okay , then ... But you can 't hunt without a weapon . Ever killed something before ? Who knows ? Maybe you 're good at it . So , what does this seaweed look like ? Like that . WELLS : Hey , that thing that bit Octavia , how big was it ? Big . We could rig this into some kind of a net . Find something to lower it into the water . Or we could just do that . ( DISTANT SCREECHING ) WELLS : Let 's get out of here . ( SUSTAINED NOTE ) - Grounders ? - It could be a war cry . FINN : ... or a warning . WELLS : What the hell is that ? Run . Run ! WELLS : Clarke . You 're up . Clarke . Sorry . Well , if your strategy is to lose really fast , that was a great move . What 's going on ? Nothing . You can talk to me . My dad found a problem with the oxygen system . - I 'm not supposed to know . - They 've had other malfunctions . They always figure out a way to deal with it . No . This one might not be fixable . The council doesn 't want anyone to know . The council meaning my dad ? Yeah . And my mom and the others . I think he 's gonna go public anyway . Clarke , he can 't . He 'll get floated . I know . But what if he 's right ? Don 't people deserve to know the truth ? You can 't tell your dad I told you . You can 't tell anyone . Your secret 's safe with me . I promise . FINN : Clarke , run ! ( HIGH PITCH WHISTLING ) It 's getting inside . FINN : Seal up any openings . ( CLARKE WHIMPERS ) Come on ! There are caves this way . ( GRUNTS ) ( COUGHING ) ATOM ( SHOUTING ) : Bellamy ! Bellamy ! ( COUGHING ) - What 's going on ? - GIRL : Air got thick , everybody 's skin started burning . Monty , my brother 's out there . He 'll be fine . Well all be fine . ( GROWLING ) FINN : it 's still out there . CLARKE : Look , we should just make a run for it . Jasper can 't wait much longer . Us dying in a cloud of acid fog isn 't gonna help Jasper . - CLARKE : Is that ... - FINN : Booze . Hooch . Rotgut . Well , careful . Finn , it could be ... Whiskey , I think . Better than the moonshine on Agro Station . Alcohol 's toxic . This is Earth . Everything 's toxic . Plus , it 's a time-honored rite of passage . We 'll pass . Far be it from me to stand in the way of tradition . ( SCREAMS ) No ! BELLAMY : Charlotte , wake up . I 'm sorry . Does it happen often ? ( SIGHS ) What are you scared of ? You know what ? It doesn 't matter . The only thing that matters is what you do about it . But , I 'm asleep . Fears are fears . Slay your demons when you 're awake , they won 't be there to get you when you sleep . Yeah , but , how ? You can 't afford to be weak . Down here , weakness is death , fear is death . Let me see that knife I gave you . Now , when you feel afraid , you hold tight to that knife and you say , " screw you . " " I 'm not afraid . " Screw you . I 'm not afraid . Screw you . I 'm not afraid . Slay your demons , kid . Then you 'll be able to sleep . It 's been hours . Jasper- - Is in good hands . Octavia will take care of him . While we 're on the subject , why is it that everyone thinks me wanting Jasper to not die is a bad thing ? Like I 'm such a downer . I can be fun . Yeah . You think I 'm fun . Right ? Oh , yeah . Among other things . You 're fun . You remember that time- - Remember that time you betrayed me and got my father executed ? Yeah , I remember . Where were we ? Fun . Yeah . Well , since you brought it up , and I didn 't , because I don 't want to talk about it , what were you thinking ? I made a mistake , Clarke . " I made a mistake , Clarke . " Not good enough . You know , I bet you couldn 't wait to run to daddy . Tell him everything so that he 'd finally believe you were the perfect son he always wanted . What do you want me to say ? I want an explanation . I can 't give you one . I thought I could trust him . Well , I thought I could trust my best friend . Guess we were both wrong . I 'm still your friend . No , you 're not . If you were my friend , you would walk out into that fog and never come back . Okay , how about we just ... take it easy . I have no idea how to do that . So , we having fun yet ? ( JASPER MOANS ) GIRL : That kid 's driving me nuts . BOY : Can 't take this much longer . ( COUGHING ) ( MOANING CONTINUES ) That 's it . I 'm ending this . I heard Bellamy gave him till tomorrow . Yeah , well , Bellamy isn 't here , is he ? The kid 's dying anyway . I 'm just getting it over with . MONTY : Murphy 's going to kill Jasper ! The lock 's on the other side . Don 't let him in ! MURPHY : I 'm gonna kill him , okay ? Let me in ! Let me in , Monty ! No rush . I 'm fine here . I sot n ! OCTAVIA : Do it ! MURPHY : Monty , you better open up this hatch right now ! ( BANGING ) In this time of uncertainty , we will come together as a people . I 'm telling you this because you must know the truth and because I want a future for my child and yours . Be strong . CLARKE : You 're gonna disobey the council ? Dad , I know . I heard you and Mom . Okay , you know . I 've been thinking about this a long time . JAKE : The people have a right to know . Your mother doesn 't understand . What 's the plan ? You don 't need to know the plan . You 're making a video , so , what ? You 're gonna break into the communications mainframe ? Making you either suicidal or incredibly dumb . Wow . You are picking a fine moment to start behaving like a typical teenager . - I 'm gonna help you . - No . No , Clarke , you 're not . - But I can- - - Absolutely not . No . No , baby . You get that stubborn streak from your mother , you know . One of many things I love about both of you . ( BEEPING ) Jake Griffin , you 're under arrest for treason . Dad ? Dad ? No , no , no . Get your hands off of her . Let me go ! I 'll warn them . I 'll find a way . No , Clarke , no , listen to me . Do not . Do not do that . Get off of me ! Let me go ! Let me go ! Dad ! Dad ! The fog 's cleared . Come on . Let 's go . Jasper 's waiting . FINN : Last night was pretty intense . You and Clarke ever ... No . Not like that . So , help me out . Your best friend tells you something fairly explosive . You seem like the type of guy that 'd keep it to yourself . You don 't know me . Why 'd you do it ? I don 't know . Why do you care ? You knew what the rules were on the Ark . You had to know her dad would get floated . I made a choice . If she hates me for the rest of my life , I made the right choice , and that 's all you have to know . It 's all clear . Anybody out here ? Jones ? JONES : We 're here ! Lost you in the stew . Where 'd you go ? Made it to a cave down there . The hell was that ? - I don 't know . - Where is Atom ? Trapped in a 100-year-old car by toxic fog . Last night was pretty ... What 's the word ? Fun . It wasn 't fun . It was irresponsible . We should 've left the second the fog cleared . FINN : Even if the fog cleared , we 'd never make it back through these woods at night . You were kind of rough on Wells . Hardly . He 's a pretty straight-up guy . And he loves you . You know that , right ? But every time your dad comes up , he won 't give you a straight answer . Makes me think he 's hiding something . FINN : So , I gotta ask you . How sure are you that Wells is the one who turned in your dad ? 100 percent . All right ? He 's the only one I told . Is he the only one who knew ? ( GIRL SCREAMS ) CLARKE : Who was that ? ( GASPING ) Son of a bitch . Atom . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( WHISPERING ) Kill me . Kill me . ( GASPING ) ( CHOKING , COUGHING ) ATOM : I ... can 't ... breathe . ( GASPING CONTINUES ) Don 't be afraid . Go back to camp . BELLAMY : Charlotte , you too . ( WHISPERS ) Kill me . ATOM : Please , please . I heard screams . BELLAMY : Charlotte found him . I sent her back to camp . ( ATOM GASPING ) Okay . I 'm gonna help you , all right ? ( HUMMING ) ( CONTINUES HUMMING ) ( KIDS CLAMORING ) BOY : Hey , everyone they 're back . CLARKE : We 've gotta get to Jasper . I 'll need boiled water to make the medicine . Get Clarke whatever she needs . I better go get this grave dug . It 's about time . They 're gonna kill Jasper . - Did you get the medicine ? - Yeah . I got it . Come on . Let 's go talk . Octavia , just stay there . Please , stay back . Stop . OCTAVIA : Atom . - There 's nothing I could do . - Don 't . - Oh , please . - Don 't . Lose anyone here ? No . Jasper ? Still breathing . Barely . I tried to take him out , but your psycho little sister ... - MURPHY : Bellamy . - ( SHOUTING ) My what ? My what ? Your little sister . Yeah , that 's right . My little sister . Got anything else you want to say about hen ? Nothing . Sorry . Get him out of here . Hey , baby . You have to warn them , Abby . Jake , stop . The Ark 's dying . There 's no choice . ABBY : Yes , there is . There 's Earth . We 'll at least have a chance . JAKE : Here . Hang on to that . And give this to Clarke and tell her that I ... CLARKE : Dad ! ABBY : Clarke , you shouldn 't be here , honey . You don 't want to see this . It 's okay . It 's okay. it 's okay . Here . Keep that for me . Jake , it 's time . I love you , kid . I love you . Okay . Oh , my God . ( SOBBING ) I 'm so sorry . ( WHISPERING ) Sweetheart , it 's not your fault . I 'm really sorry about Atom . I guess we 're gonna have to get used to people dying down here , aren 't we ? But not you . You hear me ? You 're not allowed to die . CLARKE : Wells ? I know I probably don 't deserve it , but I need to know the truth . It was my mom . Wasn 't it ? She 's the one who told your dad . CLARKE : I didn 't want to believe it . I ... I couldn 't . I blamed you because my father 's dead and it 's my mother 's fault . Isn 't it ? Wells , please . I knew how you would feel . - I wanted to- - - To protect me . So , you let me hate you . What are friends for ? How can you forgive me ? That is already done . Smooth . ( COUGHS ) Disgusting . Love it . JASPER : Can I get a hit of that ? Jasper ! Let 's start with the soft stuff . Welcome back , buddy . Was that a dream or did I get speared ? You 'll have a very impressive scar to prove it . My savior . Thank you for not dying . I don 't think I could 've taken that today . I 'll try not to die tomorrow , too , if that 's cool . ( ALL LAUGH ) Oh , hello . ( ANIMAL SOUNDS ) Hi . Couldn 't sleep ? I never can . You on watch ? Join me . I had a nightmare . I have them every night . But ... I think I found a way to make them stop . ( BIRDS FLUTTER ) I 'm sorry . CHARLOTTE : No ! ( GRUNTING ) ( COUGHING ) ( GASPS ) Every night , I see him . Your father . He kills my parents and ... And I see his face and I wake up and I see yours . And the nightmare never ends . The only way to make it end was to slay my demons . I had to .

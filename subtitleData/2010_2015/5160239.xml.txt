 Previously , on Fringe ... Whatever they needed from you , they have it now . It 's not safe for you here anymore . You have to go home . You know who you are , don 't you ? What happens now ? She can move between worlds . If we can learn what she already knows ... We can begin to defend ourselves . What if her new identity doesn 't hold ? Then she 'll no longer be necessary . What about our agent Dunham ? Has she made contact ? She 's on the other side , focused on the task at hand . Good night . Good night . Hello ? Walter , is that you ? I can hear you breathing . Is this Peter bishop ? Yes . I 'm calling from New York . I know this is gonna sound crazy , but I just saw a woman disappear in front of my eyes . Who is this ? Her name was Olivia . She has a message for you . She 's trapped in the other universe . Who is it ? Apparently I 'm eligible for unprecedented savings . Unprecedented savings at midnight ? Well , it 's never too late for savings . Apparently not . I think that you should save their number and call them back when they 're sleeping . Blocked . What you doing ? Just sending an email . At 2 : 15 ? Well , it 's not 2 : 15 in Greece . Thought I 'd catch up with a friend in corinth . You got a friend in corinth ? Yeah . And like he always says ... Na einai kalytero anthropo apo ton patera toy . What does it mean ? It means , " be a better man than your father . " His dad 's not great at communicating either , so we have that in common . I thought I 'd stay in touch . Oh . I 'm going back to bed . You coming ? Yeah , I 'll be right there . I 'm just gonna grab a glass of water . Okay . I failed the test , didn 't I ? What did it mean ? The Greek phrase . It meant exactly what I said it meant ... But it was Olivia who said it to me , not some friend . How 'd you figure me out ? Had something to do with that phone call , didn 't it ? How 'd you do it ? How 'd you replace our Olivia ? You were with us when we came back from the other side , weren 't you ? You have a lot of questions . I understand . But you can understand that I can 't give you the answers . This from the woman standing in front of me in pajamas who just shared the same bed with me . I guess answers is where you draw the line . It 's not realistic to think that I wouldn 't do what I came here to do . Is this gonna kill me ? Not if you do it right . Five ccs should be enough . So why are you here ? What was the assignment ? That 's all right . I wouldn 't tell me either . 'Cause if you 're telling the truth and this doesn 't kill me , the last thing you want me to have is information . You gonna come after me ? You gonna kill me ? No , I 'm gonna get answers . And if I find out that you did anything to Olivia , then I 'm going to kill you . The effects of the paralysis will wear off in a few hours . Holy ... Any nausea ? Yeah . Bit of a headache too . On a scale of one to ten ? Tequila hangover or something like that . Eight weeks ... And none of us suspected anything . Did she give you any indication at all where she was headed ? Anything you might have overlooked ? Not that I could think of . I 'll get these to the lab , sir . I 'd like some samples sent to my lab as well as quickly as possible . Any luck running that call that came in to my cell phone ? All we know is that it was made from a Manhattan pay phone at 12 : 21 A.M. There 's no way of knowing who placed it . Odd . It seems that Olivia was able to cross over momentarily , but unable to stay here . Well , we got to get her back . So how do we get over there , Walter ? Crossing over is out of the question . Not without Olivia 's help . But there may be something I haven 't thought of yet . Peter , you said she administered the paralytic at 2 : 15 A.M. Now what were you doing here at 2 : 15 A.M. ? Olivia called our house . She thought she heard someone trying to enter her apartment . And of course ... Walter , you don 't have to cover for me . Since we came back from over there , Olivia and I became something more than friends . I see . It 's perfectly understandable , son . In the ' 70s , I innocently wandered into the wrong home and it was three days before I realized my mistake . And unlike Olivia , the woman with whom I was sharing a bed didn 't look like my wife at all . She took the wrong computer . I was searching her computer last night and she caught me , but I convinced her that it was mine . What 's on it ? I don 't know . It was encrypted . Hernandez , I want access to every file on this computer . That 's what they do , isn 't it ? They make you wait for ' em . I 've been waiting ... For seven years . Your kind isn 't so good at keeping promises . But I guess you 've got it all under control . Agent Dunham hasn 't completed her mission yet . No , but we can 't worry about that now . We need to provide her with an extraction point . Well , sir , last time we swapped an entire steel bridge with you on it . The principle is the same . You simply need to narrow the harmonic field to focus on something smaller . A single person . We 'll use the girl . I 've gotten all we need from her and obviously they have equivalent mass . Pull your team off whatever they 're doing . I need a time and a location for agent Dunham . Alive or dead ? How do you want to send back their Olivia ? Alive or dead ? Because I feel there are very valuable parts for study and I would just have to replace her mass . He 's ready for you . Someone helped her get past our patrols onto this island . Whoever the traitor is , they don 't understand our goals . To save our world from destruction . Our people . Our families . I know that you know this as well as I do , Phillip . For the past 20 years , our world has been breaking apart because of what they did . And now with what we 've discovered about how that girl crosses over , we 're about to turn the tide . Only one world can survive . And finally we have made strides so that it can be ours . Our Olivia will be returning shortly . Her mission over there was a success . To her safe return . No ! No ! No ! No , please ! No ! No ! Please , please , please help me ! I ... Let me go ! I can 't ... well , so far , despite his obvious eccentricities , Dr. bishop has been very helpful . And Peter ? He 's been helpful too . I like him . So this is how she learned about us ? Is there anything in there about how she communicates with the other side ? So far , besides Olivia 's debriefs , just files on all the cases we handled . I 'm a fraud . A failure . Four hours of intense meditation augmented by a precise two-gram dose of brown Betty and I 've got nothing . There is no way to cross over safely . I 'm afraid I have failed you . I am sorry . And I have failed Olivia . Walter , you haven 't failed us or her . Any news ? So far , our task force has recovered 17 pieces of Walternate 's device . 5 : 30 this morning , the other Olivia used her clearance to access the aircraft hangar where they 're being stored . She took this . Well , that explains why she 's here . Walternate couldn 't find all the pieces to the machine on the other side . Maybe he sent her over to retrieve it . What if her mission is complete ? Then she may be going home . And not only may Walternate be able to complete this device , but if we lose her , we lose our chance to use her to get Olivia back . Dr. bishop ... Any thoughts on how she would cross to the other side ? No . Nothing . And I have no idea how to bring our Olivia back . It 's all because of that temptress . She tricked my son with her carnal manipulations and he fell right into her " vagenda . " " Vagenda " ? Like mata hari using her feminine wiles to accomplish her evil ends . And I too fell prey . She used my stomach to get through to my heart . Hey , Walter ... Didn 't she tell you she always brought these back when she went to the federal building ? This bakery is in the Bronx . Why would she go there ? Because she must know somebody there . Let me see that address . You want new legs ? There 's one more thing I need you to do for me . So why would she be coming here ? Let 's split up and show her picture around . I 'll take the pastry shop . Help you ? Yeah , I hope so . I 'm looking for a woman who frequents this area . You seen her before ? No . Can 't say I have . You sure ? Yeah . Typewriters , huh ? Seems like kind of a high-rent area to be selling something so retro . People come from all over the city . I specialize in stuff that 's hard to find . Yeah , I can see that . Can also see my computer right here . Hey , they promised me new legs . How does it work ? I don 't know . No , really , I don 't . They just come here . It 's a quantum entangled telegraph . It 's a machine that could communicate between universes . It 's fascinating . Well , if it works anything like a normal typewriter ... penn station . Newark . Oh , no , no , no . Your money 's no good here , sir . Times are tough . It 's nice to know we have heroes . Thank you . I wanted to come and see you . Thank you for not giving me up . You easily could have . How is your son ? He 's sleeping through the night again . We owe that to you . I want you to know that I realize that . Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable ? That 's not why you 're here . You 're here to make yourself more comfortable . Maybe . Do you know what they 're gonna do to me ? Why I have these marks on my forehead ? They 're sending me back . They 're gonna swap me for your Olivia . But they 're gonna kill me first . They 're gonna cut out my brain ... . And study it . Please help me . If you can get me out of here , I can get myself home . I can 't . My world is dying because of what your side is doing to us . If I help you escape ... no . Despite what you think , my universe is not at war with yours . This all began because a man came over here to save a boy and 25 years later , I came back to save that same boy . But if you let me die , then we will strike back and we will fight . But if you let me go , both universes can survive . There must be another way and I promise you I will find it . Two floors up , there 's a lab there . If you can get me in there , then I can get myself back home . And if you 're lying ? You 'd say anything right now because your life depends on it , but what if your side has every intention of our destruction ? Am I supposed to just hope you 're telling me the truth ? If you don 't trust me ... Then there is no hope . I 'm sorry . Please . Please . So are you gonna tell me ? Or are we gonna keep on pretending that there isn 't something on your mind ? I have a decision to make . Okay . Remember when I joined fringe division ? Two weeks into the job , we had that vortex in the east river . 165 people swallowed up . Half of ' em kids . And it 's gotten even worse since then . Now we may actually have a chance to start to put our world back together . Fix it . Only thing is , to do that , we 're gonna have to go to war . A lot of lives will be lost . An unimaginable number . And I don 't know if I can live with that . There may be another option , but it could put everything at risk . Either way , who am I to play God with other people 's lives ? Who am I to make that choice ? 20 years ago , I knew that you were the right man to protect our world . After all these years , I 've never stopped believing that . I think this world is in as much pain as it can stand . We need to restore hope . Tell your people she 's armed and dangerous , but she has to be taken alive . She may be the only chance we have to recover our agent . Understood , sir . Good . I 'll call you when we get close . Dr. bishop , any thoughts ? Several . Not many of them pleasant , however . I meant do you have any idea why she 's headed to penn station ? Do you think she 's trying to cross to the other side ? Is there a soft spot there ? No . Not as far as I know . Peter , we 'll get her . And we 're going to bring Olivia home . Glad you 're feeling so confident . She was strong enough to get us a message . And if there were anyone I would bet on to survive over there , it would be her . Spin her . What 's her heart rate ? 60 resting . Should I give her more sedative ? No , if her heart rate lowers any more , we won 't be able to preserve her organs . Why don 't you go prepare the coolers in the receiving room ? Excuse me ! You 're not allowed to be ... we don 't have much time . We have to get out of here . Come on . Get up . You came back for me . Don 't thank me yet . I have to give you adrenaline . Oh , no . Please don 't don 't do ... Man , that hurt . Sorry . Don 't be . The ground floor ? What 's there ? The lab . They have a deprivation tank there . And that 'll help you cross over ? Yeah , it 's something to do with the lack of sensory input . What is it ? I 'm not positive , but I think it 's cortexiphan . What 's that ? It 's a long story , but if I 'm right , this is why they stopped their experiments on me . 'Cause they found what they needed and it could help your people cross over to my side . They emptied the tank . I-I-I can 't cross over . Come on . We have to go . No , you 've done enough . Now if I can just get to the other side of the island , then maybe I could swim for it . I 've done it before . Then I 've got to get to Boston . What 's in Boston ? The secretary has a lab there at Harvard just like my Walter bishop on the other side . And your Walter has a deprivation tank , so you think the secretary may have had one too ? Well , they 're genetically identical , so they think alike and , yeah , it 's possible . I can 't think of anything ... they 've changed the harbor patrols . You 'll never make it . But I can get you there . Come on . Hello ? Sir , there 's been an incident at liberty island . What kind of incident ? Olivia Dunham is gone . Here you go . Best coffee west of the Passaic . You want cream and sugar ? No . You can keep the change . Some things are gonna be hard to leave behind . Come on . Time for you to go home . You know , I sometimes dream about it . The other side . Sadly , for my kind , coming here is a one-way ticket . I thought your kind didn 't care . Give me your right hand . Palm up . Eight identities in the last five years , but this has been my favorite . I seem to be a big hit with the ladies . You may want to close your eyes . Have you spotted her ? No . There are six entrances to the building . We 've got a team on each one of them . Don 't shoot yourself . No gun for me . Good idea . Okay , turn around , lift up the back of your shirt . Let 's split up . You three , with me . The transfer 's scheduled for 4 : 00 . That 's in precisely 23 minutes . Oh , I 'm sorry . I know you 're cleaning , but I really have to ... Dunham ! Freeze ! I got her . She 's in the northwest bathroom . She 's in there with another guy . I want two teams . One from the west and one from the east . Okay . Put your guns down or I will shoot her . Put your guns down or I will kill her ! Put ' em down . Oh , my God . Mom ! Mom ! Don 't you make me kill her . Mom ! What 's your daughter 's name ? Your daughter 's name ! What is it ? Mom ! Drop your weapon now ! Take her . Where is she ? Where 's Olivia ? Tell me how we get her back . I don 't know . That wasn 't part of my assignment . Listen , whatever happens to me , I want you to know that this started out as an assignment , but it became ... something more . That would be so much easier to believe if you weren 't in handcuffs right now . Mr. bishop ? Yeah ? We found this in the bathroom . No sign of the component she stole , but we also found the second body . Thank you . So what do we do now ? Okay , I think that 's it . Move in . Go , go , go ! They 're here . How did they find us ? Subcutaneous tracker . I 'm too important to lose . Look , I 've seen war . But if what you 're saying is true , in the end , I have to believe in hope . Please make this worth it . Go ! Colonel Broyles , you are under arrest . Where 's the girl ? Freeze ! Don 't move ! She 's in the tank ! Open it up ! Olivia ? Olivia ! Oh , God . I want a three-car escort , half-mile buffer zone all the way to Boston . What ? These look familiar . Familiar how ? I don 't know yet . E minor . It 's pretty . That was Astrid . Olivia 's back . She 's what ? Apparently she crossed over into your father 's lab . Astrid 's with her . They 're in an ambulance on their way to Boston general . Why Boston general ? Is she okay ? They think she had some kind of seizure . All right , I 'm going to see Olivia . Peter ? Walter , just stay ... no . I remember why this is familiar . They 're harmonic rods . Like belly and I used to use to help objects cross between universes . And this was found in their Olivia 's bag ? Yes . Broyles ! Broyles , stop . I don 't think you want to see this . Hey , Liv , check this out . No more pain . No more burns . I 'm as good as new . It 's like nothing ever happened . Just like nothing ever happened . Excuse me , agents . Have you seen colonel Broyles ? He 's late to work this morning . Have you tried calling him ? Yes , I tried calling him at home too and his wife said that he did not come home last night and that is very unlike him . I 've never been a big fan of needles . Doctors , needles , hospitals . Make a fist . You know , when you 're a kid and you 're sick , you know , you just ... you come to hate ' em all . Go ahead . Try ' em out . That 's it ? Only one way to find out . Thank you . Thank you . Peter . I 'm sorry , Olivia . Don 't apologize . You were the only thing that got me through . If it wasn 't for you , I would never have made it back . You saved my life .

 There is an alternate universe . And in it , another version of us . - Put your hands up . - Do you know what she is ? - A shapeshifter . - She was once just a human being . - You must be very proud . - Oh , I am . Of all of them . Forty-seven so far . That tracker we had on Jones . How 'd he pinpoint our wavelength that quickly ? Think someone from our team told him ? You have a better idea ? Don 't know if she said , but when we first met , I 'd lost my partner , Robert . He and his wife had this incredible relationship . The way she looked at him . Olivia looks at you the same . I hadn 't realized how much I longed for family . Yeah . They 're great . It 's perfect . - What 's going on ? - Shh , shh . It 's grazing day . Grazing day ? Walter thinks that she 's depressed . Technically it 's seasonal affective disorder . Bovines aren 't meant to spend extended periods inside . They need lots of vitamin D. Sunshine . We 're taking a trip out to Warwick . Her favorite pasture . I see . I almost forgot . I , uh ... I found this in my apartment . I think it might be yours . It has a name engraved on the back . Robert Danzig ? He was your partner , wasn 't he ? Yeah . It was his . How did I wind up with it ? Actually , I gave it to you when you came to see me at the hospital . It was a thank you for saving my life . You don 't remember me telling you what this symbolizes ? It 's Native American . The maze represents the journey of life . The obstacles . Making the right choices until we find ourselves in the center . What 's in the center ? Home . A place to belong . Danzig knew I was never much for putting down roots . I never really stayed in the same place too long . He joked that if I kept living like that one day , I would float off into space . So he gave me this as a reminder that I always had a home . With him . With his family . This , he said , was my tether . Olivia , the sedative . Gene 's getting anxious . Excuse me . - Here . Let me give you a hand with those . - Thank you . - Let me guess . Gene 's picnic lunch ? - Ha . Yeah , I wish . Apparently , the Other Side is requesting a detailed debrief of our recent run-ins with David Robert Jones . And given the gaps in Agent Dunham 's memory Broyles thinks it 's best if somebody else goes . Lucky me . You sound less than enthused . I was supposed to take my dad to Castle Island today . I promised him . Breaking promises . - One of the many perks of the job . - Yeah , sadly . What if I went for you ? Not to diminish Agent Farnsworth 's assignment , liaison duty 's a formality . Part of our cooperation agreement ... I disagree . Coordinating with the Other Side could yield leads on Jones . - We have nothing to go on . - You 're more valuable on this side . I appreciate the sentiment , but nothing 's going on today . Unless you count grazing day . Grazing day ? Look , Agent Dunham and the others are busy . Agent Farnsworth already has family obligations . I don 't have anywhere to be . Frankly , I think I could use the time away . - Ugh . - Hi . Please . What ... What do you want ? That was a mistake . I 'm sorry . Initiating scan . Scan complete . Agent Lee , please come this way . You can set up in here . I 'll let Captain Lee and Agent Dunham know you 've arrived . - Agent Lee . - Agent Dunham . - Nice to see you . - Would 've been nicer if you 'd brought me a caffe latte instead of that pile of paperwork . - Heh . Uh , maybe next time . - A change of plans . - You 're gonna brief on the way . - On the way where ? So Jones is responsible for dosing Agent Dunham with Cortexiphan . For what purpose ? Peter believes he was trying to activate a latent ability . Are we talking heat vision or communicating with fish ? Heh . Your guess is as good as mine . - Did it work ? - Yes . And no . Uh ... There were some unforeseen side effects . Long story . That 's why they sent you instead of her ? Or did you just draw the short straw ? What 's that ? The Department of Containment 's reopening this part of the city . Zone 13-A more commonly referred to as Parkside , was closed on November 12th , 2004 due to severe toxic air conditions . There is one live media alert on this subject . Would you like to play it ? Go on , don 't be shy . - Uh , yes . - Ha , ha . This is a turning point in our history . In the last week alone , 11 previously uninhabitable zones have been re-opened . Our cities are healing . Our world is being restored . But the process will take time . So as we celebrate this recovery let us never forget those we 've lost . Thank you , everyone . Things are getting better because of the bridge ? It stabilized the spatial rifts in the ambered areas . Don 't know how it works , don 't care . - I 'm just happy . - Hmm . Wanna settle a bet ? Sure . If I can . What 's your middle name ? Tyrone . - Seriously ? - It was my great grandfather 's name . Huh . Why ? What 's up , Tyrone ? How the hell did you ? - Hey . - Hey . - Why would you tell her that ? - You don 't like Tyrone ? - I think it 's a strong middle name . - He 's been my partner for six years yet he wouldn 't tell me his middle name . - My bad . - Ha . Okay , so what 's the skinny ? - Got the body of an unidentified assailant . A Paige Randall placed an emergency call last night after she was assaulted . She reports that during the attack , someone saved her . Think it has to do with those vigilante cases P.D. ' s been working ? - Exactly . Local police received a dozen similar reports in the last few months . Criminals going missing , junkies mysteriously vanishing . Victims calling in , claiming assailants were attacked mid-crime . Maybe Batman 's moved to The Bronx . - What 's a Batman ? - The Caped Crusader . The Dark Knight . Billionaire puts on a cape to clean up Gotham ? - Oh , you mean Mantis . - Seriously ? Your superhero 's an insect ? What , because nothing says badass like a flying rat ? I don 't think Mantis or Batman could 've done this . - Were all the other bodies like this ? - No other bodies . - First one we 've found . - Assuming this is our guy makes you wonder why he left this body behind . What 's changed ? Seven parts per million . Nominal readings . So far so good . How about a souvenir ? Remember this match ? That was the most brutal 14 rounds I 've ever seen . Thanks . I 'd rather forget it . I lost two Fillmores on that fight . Four parts per million . Think we 're all clear here . Good , I 'll call it in to Dispatch . Hey . Just a sec . I 'm reading high amounts of tissue organics . Must be a false positive . I don 't think so . Pat Wilkinson got the same reading yesterday . According to this , it 's coming from inside the church . Someone 's been in here . This zone 's been uninhabitable for eight years . Hello ? Anyone here ? What is that ? My God . Hey . I 'm sorry about the timing . This is gonna tie us up for a while , so debrief 's gonna wait . Yeah , of course . I get it . Uh , hey , Reynolds ? Agent Lee 's gonna need a ride back to the DOD and also an escort to the bridge . - Uh ... - Wait , what ? - I assumed , under the circumstances you 'd want to return to your side . Oh , no . That 's okay . I don 't have to go . I mean , it 's no problem for me . I 'd like to be of assistance if I can . Sure . Excuse me , Agent Lee . I just wanted to tell you , uh well thanks . Um ... You 're welcome . What was that about ? Does he think I 'm him ? Ha , ha , no . He knows who you are . He was thanking you because our world , in part , is healing because we 're working together . Your team may toil in secret over there , but over here , you 're heroes . Afternoon . What 's your name ? Canaan . My name 's Canaan . Nice to meet you . I 'm Helen . Haven 't seen you around here before . Do you have a place to stay ? I did . I just ... - It 's gone now . - I 'm sorry to hear that . Can I carry this for you ? Sure . Thanks . We 'll find you a place to sleep tonight . It 's too cold to be out on the street . Father Luis has got availability . I 'll check in with him . You go ahead and dig in . - Thank you . - Be right back . Hey . Mister . You got something on your neck . Canaan ? I count 18 bodies and 19 heads . Months ago , I 'd have a much harder time stomaching this . - Took me a while too . - Not Liv , though . Things like this never faze her . She 's the tough one . All our years working together , never once ever seen her barf or shed a tear . Hey , Lincoln . Mine . What do you got , Red ? Someone or something was living here . Whatever it was , it must 've realized that its lair was about to be compromised with this zone reopening . Which is why it left its last victim behind last night . I found this on that body over there . Nice work . We can run this through facial rec . Maybe ID the victim . Do you people have any way to determine time of death ? I mean , with remains in this condition ? Uh , provided there are certain active enzymes or lactic acid still in the tissue . Sure . Why ? What are you thinking ? I 'd like to see all the surveillance feeds from areas around this zone . Why are we doing this exactly ? Finding surveillance of the victim after she disappeared has a probability rate of , at best , one in 86.7 thousand . Humor me . - So to speak . - Time of death on our headless corpse . - You wanna tell me why you needed it ? - Not worth mentioning just yet . I 'll let you know if it pans out . Maybe you 'll also tell me why you don 't wanna go back home . What are you talking about ? Olivia tried to arrange for your return trip to the Other Side but you weren 't having any . There a problem ? No problem . Just ... - They can handle things fine . - That 's the difference between us . My world wouldn 't survive without me . Yeah , I noticed that about you . Your unwavering confidence . Thanks . Bordering on self-aggrandizing narcissism . Don 't get me wrong . I could use some of that myself . We 're not much alike , you and me . Not that I can see . Where 'd you grow up ? - Why ? - I 'm looking for where our paths diverged . - Teaneck , New Jersey . - Me too . - Till mom died and dad moved us ... - To Philadelphia . - He started a business there ... - Lee 's Hardware . Huh . How about that ? - Hamilton High ? - Yep . Tenth grade science teacher . Mr. Glasberg . Graduating GPA ? Three-point-eight-five . - I slacked off my senior year ... - To work at my Dad 's store . - Prom date ? - Aha , I didn 't go to prom . - I 'd just broken up with ... - Alicia Dvoskin . Is this normal ? Sharing so much history ? Captain Lee ? Agent Lee ? System is registering an 82 percent face-rec to the photo in the locket . - What are those growths on her face ? - I don 't know . But you approximated her time of death between 1 and 3 a.m. Five days ago . Yeah ? Check the timecode . That footage was taken more than two days later . That 's impossible . She can 't be walking around after she died . I ran the tests twice , doesn 't make sense . It does . I needed something like this to confirm it . Confirm what ? A shapeshifter ? - You think our vigilante is a shapeshifter ? - Yes , sir . Do you two concur ? We have surveillance of the victim more than two days after death . Granted . But I 'm still not convinced , with apologies to Captain Lee that an error wasn 't somehow made . I don 't see anything that correlates with what we know about shapeshifters . Right . Not the versions you 've encountered , Agent Broyles ... - Colonel . - Sorry . Colonel Broyles . Since my partner was killed by one of these I 've become an expert on shapeshifters . I 've studied each and every file , every detail my team had on the subject . The earlier bio-synthetic versions required a three-pronged device to acquire the victim 's appearance . It needed to be jammed onto their palate leaving a three-pronged indentation in the roof of the mouth . Which is what we found inside Bree Collins at the church . And the other bodies ? Did they have the same markings ? Nothing conclusive . I 've read these files too , Agent Lee . The unique state in which we found those bodies bears no resemblance to corpses left by early shapeshifter prototypes . How do you explain that ? - I can 't . - And further how would you reconcile this version 's MO with Jones ' agenda ? Why would Jones be targeting criminals ? I 'm sorry , but I suspect , in your desire to avenge your partner , you may be unconsciously perverting evidence to fit the profile . - Colonel , I don 't think ... - We appreciate the assistance you 've given but as you were here for sharing intel it may be in the interests of both our agencies if you returned home . As for you two alert me when you have something more concrete . Well , that went well . Hey , Joe , you gonna run ? Yeah , give me a second . - You know , you 're really good . - Thanks . - Andrew ! Come on ! - All right ! Dawes , you jackass . I told you not to take so much . It 's all we got ' til morning . Shut up , Mikey . I gotta take a leak . Colonel Broyles . P.D. ' s reporting an eyewitness account that may be related to our vigilante . - How long ago ? - Six minutes . - Where ? - Precinct 17 . Northwest quadrant . Pelham district . Have P.D. Lock down the perimeter . Five block radius . - Do we have an ID on the victim ? - Affirmative . Victim 's name is Antonio Dawes . His record includes possession and distribution of narcotics , auto theft , burglary . - Fits our profile . - Contact local P.D. - Tell them to look out for suspicious activity . - Excuse me , Colonel . - Thought you were on your way home . - Circulate Dawes ' mugshot . If we 're dealing with a shapeshifter , that 's what he 'll look like . What have we got to lose ? Agent Farnsworth , upload the photo onto the city-wide database . I 'll scan traffic cams in the area too . Good . Captain Lee , assemble a Tac team . Keep me apprised of the situation . Yes , sir . Always do . Come on . You 're with me . We want him alive . If you want Jones ... I 'm getting Jones . But I 'm not gonna let this thing kill again . - Dunham . - We have a sighting of a man matching Dawes ' photo moving up Copenhagen towards 146th Street . Captain Lee is setting up a perimeter now . Copy that . We 're on our way . Our objective is to surround the subject and bring him in alive . We 'll split into three teams . You two go with Agent Dunham , you 'll take the high ground . You three , the south entrance of the alley . If he makes a break for it , cut him off . The rest of you are with me . We 're going in from the north . Yes sir . Let 's go . Move . Tactical teams , be advised . We 've lost visual on the suspect . Projected trajectory is south of last position . - Lincoln , you copy that ? - Copy . - That could put him in your vicinity . - Got it . Broyles shouldn 't have come down on you like that . If it wasn 't for you and your shapeshifter bent , we wouldn 't be onto this one . What I 'm saying is , you 're a good agent . Good as you ? Let 's not get crazy . I 've been doing this a lot longer than you . Which leads me back to " why " ? Our lives seemed pretty parallel but along the line we became very different people . Maybe it 's free will . I don 't buy that we 're all defined by our circumstances . Maybe I made a choice to become the man I wanted to be . Girls , you might wanna get off the line . Some of us are trying to work here . Sorry , Mother . Got him . Southwest of our position . - Astrid ? - Searching . Visual confirmed . Suspect is 50 meters from Agent Lee . He 's made us . He 's on the move . Suspect has entered the southwest building . Agent Lee is in pursuit . Drop the weapon , now ! Don 't shoot ! Drop it . Suspect is being secured on site . Excellent work . Relay my congratulations to Captain Lee and his team . Yes , sir . We have him in custody . 148th Street Warehouse , west of Amsterdam . They 'll be moving him at the rear . Thank you , Colonel . We 'll take it from here . Broyles dispatched a secure transport . We 're moving in ten . I want five minutes . Just to talk to him . What for ? Jones created the shapeshifter that killed my partner . If this thing has information that could lead us to him , I wanna know . I 'm under orders . You can talk to him once he 's been processed . He 'll go so high up the food chain , I 'll never get to him . You know that as well as I do . If it were your partner you 'd do the same . Five minutes . Could you give us a moment ? You had the chance to kill me back there and you didn 't . Why ? Who are you ? Who were you ? You were human once , right ? Do you always keep mementos from the lives of people you become ? It 's mine . - This is your son . - I wish he was . He was once someone in my life . It 's her boy . And Jones ? He took you from them when he did this to you . No . He came later . She left me on her own . Took Daniel with her . They just went on living their lives . As though I were never there . As if I meant nothing to them . I 've never really been , uh ... They 're these people you come across . These bright , bright lights . They drift through life . Effortlessly . Unforgettable . I 'm not one of them . I wanted to be needed . Or at least , to be missed . Do you understand ? I do . For that I needed to be more than I am . Something unique . Dr. Jones understood that . He promised to make me like no one else . I was to be the first of a new breed of human beings . - But I was a disappointment . - You didn 't turn out the way he 'd planned . You 've been targeting criminals . Sparing innocent lives . Stealing their DNA . That 's what 's keeping you alive , isn 't it ? David Robert Jones is not someone worth protecting . You were disposable to him . - As disposable as you were to Daniel . - You don 't know that . He promised he would come for me . To fix me . I 'm sorry . Shots fired ! Take cover ! - You have a 20 on the shooter ? - Negative . Hold your fire . The shooter , where is he ? Down . Down . There . Check the windows . He 's on the roof . Cover me . Delta Team , watch your 5 ! Bravo , I got no shot , no shot here . Stay calm . Tac 2 ! Suspect down . Everyone okay ? Officer down ! Officer down ! - Who knew ? - What ? Who else knew we were transporting him ? We gotta find out . Hey , Linc . Medevac 's on the way . You 're gonna be fine . Okay ? Liv , I 've been blown up before . This is nothing . That was a hell of a shot . Guess you haven 't lost your touch . Hey . This was meant for you . Do you understand that ? Jones . The man that you are protecting just tried to have you killed . It 's time to wake up . He 's never gonna welcome you back into the fold . But he has to . - I don 't know what to do . - Yes you do . You can keep waiting for someone to define you , to give you your place in the world or you can decide that you 're not somebody 's broken puppet any more . Choose . Welcome back , sir . - I trust you have good news for me ? - I do . That 'll be all . It 's done . We 've tied up our loose end . Nice job . Was there any resistance ? The redhead almost took my head off with a nearly impossible shot . That girl always amazes me . She and the one from the Other Side . He 'll be pleased we 've taken care of the problem . Now we just need him to ... Someone 's overriding the security system . There 's been a breach . Canaan . Where is she ? Understood . Let me know the moment she 's in the building . Agent Broyles , I have something to report . I already heard . We have Nina Sharp in custody . There something else ? - You 're not going to believe this . - What is it ? - Blueprints , passports , aliases . - Hell of a window into Jones ' operation . It 's more than that . Check this out . It 's a tracking board . We knew every shapeshifter was outfitted with a tracking module . - Mm-hm . I think this is some kind of central hub . You 're saying that you think every dot represents a shapeshifter ? If we can hack this mainframe we 'll have the identity of every agent in Jones ' network . Can I have a word , Agent Dunham ? - What 's going on ? - Captain Lee . He didn 't make it . Initiate scan . Scan complete . I 'd heard rumors of another world . I wasn 't sure it really existed . It does . What are we doing here ? Making good on my offer . There 's a man here who can help you . - Agent Lee . - Canaan , this is Peter and Walter Bishop . It 's a pleasure to meet you . I 'm really looking forward to studying ... Helping you . I think you 'll like it there . You don 't have to wait for someone to give you a home or live on the outside any more . Here . To keep you from floating away . Thank you . For everything . Hello ? Hey . I thought that you would be long gone by now . You know what , I wasn 't thinking . My face is the last thing you wanna see now , I should ... Lincoln . It 's fine . What 's up ? We collected a lot of intel on Jones , but there 's more work to be done . I thought I 'd stick around for a while . Figured you 'd need some help . Thanks . That 'd be nice .

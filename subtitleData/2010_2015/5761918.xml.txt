 _ Five years and counting and still remaining that tragic mystery . Why have women stop having babies ? _ All may be contributing factors . _ Maybe infertility isn 't caused by the disease . Maybe infertility is the disease . _ _ _ Ladies and gentlemen , the President of the United States . My fellow Americans , we have endured a period of hopelessness without parallel in human history . The Global Fertility Crisis has devastated our most fundamental dreams . Our maternity wards here and around the world are now empty . We 've spent these last five years searching for causes and solutions , while living with the possibility of human extinction . Our efforts to solve this mystery have been relentless and comprehensive ... And unsuccessful . Until today . This is the first step on our journey to restore our future ... The future of all humanity . There are still many hurdles ahead , but let us stop and appreciate this moment . Let this be a night we will never forget . _ _ Buy you a drink ? No , thanks . The bar bed is open . They 've got a good one . I don 't do bar beds . You know , I fathered a daughter nine years ago . I have her picture . I 'm sorry . It 's a pass . I 'd like a dirty Martini . It 's last call . Then you better hurry . How 's your night ? I don 't know yet . Just started . You know everything 's closing , right ? Sometimes you just want to skip to the end of the movie and get to the good part . Put it on my tab . You said you like it dirty . I was very clear about that . My name is Bryan . Bryan . I thought your name was Gregor . No . That 's Gregor . Thanks , Gregor . I 'm really surprised how this turned out . Yeah . Me too . I mean , I don 't usually get picked up by women . Women look for the wrong things . I happen to like your premature hair loss . It indicates a high level of testosterone . And your features show Somalian blood . Somalia used to have the highest fertility rate in the world . Wait , how did ... how did you know I had Somalian blood ? Lucky guess . No , you knew . How 'd you know ? Room 's paid for . Enjoy it . _ Ow ! Say , Elvis , is somebody picking on you at school ? - No . - Well , what , then ? Everybody is bigger than me . They 're older than you , but you 're gonna catch up . I get scared . And the mask helps ? Look , Elvis , if it were up to me , I 'd let you wear it , but your school 's got a no-superhero policy . Why ? Probably because they don 't want the kids to have more power than the teachers . Do you ever get scared ? Yeah . That 's normal . Blood sugar 's low , Superman . Go grab a juice . Can I sit in the front seat ? No . That 's the last time , okay ? Come on . Morning , Elvis . - Is that her ? - Yeah . Yeah ? Hey , don 't forget ... you have after care today , right ? Why ? Well , because I got a job outside the city . I 'll take you for a burger tonight ? Big Shot Bob 's ? Big Shot Bob 's , yes . Hey , you 're Jaden 's mom . I 'm Molly . It 's Kyle , right ? Right , yeah . Elvis tells me you comb his hair . Elvis is such a lovely boy . He doesn 't like getting his hair combed . Oh . He didn 't say anything . Well , that 's ' cause he 's 6 years old . I 'm sorry . Kyle , no one means any harm . We know his mother 's gone , and it can 't be easy being a single dad . I mean , he 's one of the Last Six . He means so much to us . We 're happy to help with Elvis ... Watch him , feed him , anything . Yeah . Look , Molly . He 's not a pet , he 's a kid , and he just wants to be normal , so leave him alone . _ _ _ Sounds good . This is Vanessa . What ? So he 's at the hospital , not the police station ? Okay , I-I 'll be there as soon as I can . Officer : Stay back ! Protest 's over . We have a constitutional right ! They can 't take my eggs without my permission ! I 'm tired of the government treating me like an animal ! Ma 'am , stop moving forward ... Go to hell ! And put your hands above your head . Hey ! Hey ! This is a legal assembly . These people have ... Okay , you know what ? Gun ! No ! It 's a badge . It 's a badge . I work for the White House . I 'm the Chief of Staff . Sorry about that . Dr. Freeman , call extension 2235 . Dr. Freeman , please call extension 2235 . Officer Lopez . I 'm Vanessa Keller . Hi . Nice to meet you . Sorry about all of this . It 's not your fault , believe me . He got aggressive when I tried to take him in , so ... I had to get aggressive back . Doctor said he 's okay , just needed some stitches . Just so you know , I have a friend at BPD . He called me and told me what happened . Right . How long have you been on the job ? - Five years . - It 's great training . In fact , a good friend of mine is with the FBI , assistant director . - He started as a cop . - Oh , really ? I actually applied to the FBI last month . Oh . Well , if there 's anything I can do to help . Counterfeit fertility drugs ? Really ? Do you have any idea ... I didn 't know that they were fake . Shut up , Nick . Just shut your damn mouth and stop lying ... for once . Look , V. , the real pills , they weren 't working , either , so what the hell 's the difference ? You are exploiting desperate women . Selling lies . I 'm selling hope . What 's so horrible about that ? You don 't stop , do you ? For 50 bucks , those women , they went home feeling better about themselves . Like they had a chance at winning something big , hitting the jackpot . That 's all an Average Joe wants ... A chance at something great . This is a fertility crime . Do you know what could have happened to you ? Could have ? Ah , so that means that , uh ... Yes , he is not filing charges , but this is the last time , Nick . I 'm not doing this for you anymore . Do this for me ? Let 's be real , V. You did this for you . I mean , Chief of Staff 's brother doing time ? That 's bad for business . Might tarnish that blue-collar , rags-to-riches image you work so hard to cultivate . I 'm Kyle . Dr. Sue referred me . Great . I just started ovulating . What about the antral follicle counts ? Normal levels , and there 's no indication of the typical disease patterns . Rachael , you might want to record this . Behold ... The first viable human embryo ... In six years . - Holy shit . - Yeah . We did it . We need to go through the storage protocol . The environment has to be perfect . Dr. Lennon ? Mr. Hayes ? I wasn 't told you were coming . I came to see a miracle . Each vial contains one viable human embryo . How many eggs have you fertilized ? 100 . That 's unbelievable . Remarkable . Every other lab in the world has failed . How did you do it ? We lowered the PH and dropped the oxygen to a hypoxic level . In essence , we 've re-created the environment of healthy , pre-crisis uterus . But it only worked on these eggs ? So far . Is there anything special about this particular batch ? Not that I know of . Can you fertilize more ? I have no idea . We need to do more tests and find surrogates . That won 't be necessary , Dr. Lennon . Excuse me ? I appreciate your diligence , but we 'll be taking the lead from this point going forward . Oh , what do you mean ? This is my lab . This lab is financed by the United States government . Yes , but this is my ... A new team of scientists will be here within the hour . I-I don 't have time for them . I 've been working on this project for five years . I 'm not gonna turn over to a new team I 've never met . You make a good point , Dr. Lennon . I appreciate your honesty . You have six new voice messages . Hey , dad . I 'm kinda sick . Will you come and get me ? Message sent at 11 : 06 A.M. Shit . Elvis ? ! Doors close at 3 : 15 . I know , man . Look , I got held up in traffic . My ... my son 's inside . - Is that Mr. Walker ? - Yeah . Let him in . Thank you . I just want what 's right for Elvis . Mr. Walker , we 're from the department of humanity . Look , I-I had a job , and it was in the mountains , a-and I didn 't have any reception . - This has never happened before . - Noted . Now can I see him , please ? We need to update the file before your son can be released . I 'm sorry . Released ? I-is Elvis okay ? A mild stomach virus ... Vomiting , headache ... That sort thing . You mean he has the flu ? It seems so . It 's going around . - Man , he scared me the crap out of me . - When they couldn 't reach you , called us . We just want to take this opportunity to update your file . Yeah , all right . Are you still making a living as computer technician ? Yeah . And you are still raising Elvis alone ? His mother left five years ago . Any communication with her ? She 's a drug addict . I have no idea if she 's even still alive . When was the last time you took a drink ? How do you know this ? When the state collected your sperm for research , they took a blood sample . It 's in the file . I 've been sober for four years . Where is Elvis ? He fine . He 's being evaluated . I-I know that you guys are just trying to do your jobs here , but you don 't know Elvis . He has these episodes where he gets scared , and he feels really alone , and I 'm the only one at can get him through that . No , no , that 's not what I 'm saying . I 'm saying that he needs to be with his father . Mr. Walker , there are only six 6-year-olds inhe country . I 'm sure you can understand the state 's compelli intest in Elvis 's health and well-being . I take good care of my son . Are you aware of the child safety belt laws ? You got to be kidding me . A child must be 8 years old and over 60 pounds to ride in the front passenger seat . Were you aware of the law ? I think we 're done with these questions . - Mr. Walker , we 'd like to update ... - You tell me where my son is ! Dr. Lennon ? Please have a seat . Do you recall the conditions of your confidentiality agreement ? Uh , pretty standard . Except for the penalties for breaching this agreement . They are not standard at all . They are quite extraordiny . I recommend you re-read it . Now , I will need your access key to the lab and computer passwords . Sir ? The transition team will help you move any personal belongings . We will need you to clear the premises within the hour . W-we 're not finished . As you may be consulted in the future , you will continue to receive your full salary . You can 't do this . The decision has been made . Dr. Lennon , again , on behalf of the country ... I want to thank you for your service . - Allison ! - James . I pulled a list of women who donated the viable eggs . I 'm gonna find out who the sperm donors were . Al , I just need to talk to you for a second . They asked me to stay on . And you said yes . Al . I mean , come on . This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity . I dedicated my career to this , too , all right ? I just want to see it through to the end . Yeah , you mean be a lapdog for the bureaucrats . Look , if you want me to , I 'll talk to Darius , I 'll see if maybe he can ... Look at you ... Already on a first-name basis with the director of the Fertility Commission . It sucks that you got fired . I get it . But you can 't expect me to fall on my sword . - My sword . - It 's my sword , James . That 's why you got fired , Al . You don 't know how to play well with others . A Scientist is supposed to think for himself , not play well with others . That 's your specialty , and by the way ... It 's a turn-off . You want to know what 's a turn ... Hey ! You want to know what 's a turn-off ? My boss using confidential sperm donor lists to find sexual partners . And no , I didn 't tell them . Don 't break your arm patting yourself on the back . Wow . That 's quite a statement . You said I had two minutes to get over here . You look ridiculous . So , what 's this urgent meeting ? Fertility breakthrough ... That 's all I know . Are you certain about this ? I was there , sir . I saw it with my own eyes . 100 viable human embryos . This is amazing . This is what we 've been waiting for . The next step , Mr. President , is to officially engage the army to oversee the operation . We 'll use military hospitals and doctors and female soldiers as surrogates . We need to control the entire process and ensure complete secrecy . Deputy secretary ? Sounds like a reasonable strategy , sir . Given the state of international affairs , the less our global partners know about our success , the better . Vanessa , what do you think ? I think we do the exact opposite . What do you mean ? Keeping this a secret is a mistake . Let 's shout our success from the rooftops . To publicize this discovery would be reckless . Sir , we don 't have the luxury of being discreet . We 're on the verge of getting blown out . What are you talking about ? The opposition is gaining momentum . They have the votes for a recall , and they will win . If we want to stay in office , we need to announce a game-changing event , which means letting the people enjoy this victory . Victory ? We don 't even know if it 's going to work yet . You really want to sell the American people a lie ? I want to sell hope . That 's what this country needs right now . Look at what 's going on out there ... The protests , the anger . You saw what happened in Austin last week . Like it or not , we are at the tipping point . These embryos could be our Moon Landing ... A triumph of science , but also a triumph of the American spirit . One giant leap for mankind . What do you suggest ? What 's the best way of moving forward ? A lottery . A lottery ? Mr. President , we need a serious plan . I want to hear this . Keep talking . Let 's share the victory with the nation . Let every woman out there feel like she has a chance to hit the jackpot . That 's all the Average Joe wants , right ? A shot at something great ? So , this is our Moon Landing ? Who is our Neil Armstrong ? _ Hi . I 'm Allison Lennon . I work with the Fertility Commission . Your facility sent 100 eggs to our lab . We 've sent thousands of eggs in the last few years . You sent them on April 29th . I need that donor list . I need an access code . If you make me go back to my office to create an official request , I will request every single donor profile of every egg ever stored here . Transfer the list . This program was created by morons . There 's all kinds of bugs . I need those names . There 's 100 donors under 100 separate files . It 'll take forever . Send me one single file . One donor . Brooke Ashton . Send me her file . I don 't know how to send files . Is there an address ? 66 Fleeta Street , D.C. - Is there another way out of here ? - Through there . Oh , I figured it out . It was easy . You dismissed the Scientist who fertilized the egg ? She was a security risk . So what ? She 's a public-relations gold mine . Always thinking about the next move . Isn 't that what you taught me ? That 's all you . I didn 't teach you to manipulate . - I saved his job . - Bullshit . The opposition doesn 't have the votes for a recall . Look , Vanessa , I know you 're thinking about making a run one day and looking for a defining moment . You think this is it . Well , you 're wrong . The lottery is a mistake . You heard the President . We 're moving forward ... With or without your blessing . Are you on board ? Yes or no ? 100 % . Can I help you ? Brooke Ashton ? The clinic opened when I was a sophomore . They had notes on the dorms . I was desperate for cash . Considered stripping . Had the body for it , but turns out , you can get a lot more for your eggs than for your boobs . Did you undergo any special treatments , any special vitamins or drugs ? Not that I know of . Why are you here ? We were able to fertilize some eggs from the Georgetown clinic . We 're not exactly sure why it worked . You fertilized human eggs ? Yes . Yours was one of them . Wait . M-my eggs were fertilized ? One of them . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . I 'm ... thi ... this is the most incredible news . I-I don 't ... I don 't even know what to say . Uh ... I knew it . What do you mean ? I 've been having these really vivid dreams . There 's always this girl , and she looks just like me . She 's even got my hair . She says she 's my daughter . * Now , I-I know that it sounds wacky , but I 'm telling you ... Children really do visit their mothers before they 're born . I bet your mother dreamt about you , too . I wouldn 't know . - I was adopted . - So was I. That is why I 've always wanted to have a child of my own . Something always felt like it was missing . I just wanted to be connected to my own bloodline . You know how it is . Always wondering where you came from . Yeah . So , how do I get my egg back ? Do I need to call a lawyer ? Do I have to sign something ? It 's ... it 's not gonna be easy . You actually signed away your rights . No , I know , but ... That egg came from me . That child would be my child . Al . Where have you been ? You know , people are looking for you . Someone from White House called six times . Al ? James , I met one of the egg donors ... Brooke Ashton . She 's 31 , and she 's viable . And what is it you think I can do ? You still have access to the lab . I have a mini Cryogenic unit . It can preserve an embryo for six months . Wait a second . You want me to steal her fertilized egg , which happens to be one of the most valuable things - on the planet . - I know , but will you do it ? It 's her egg . She 's the perfect surrogate . No . I can 't . Al , the whole lab 's locked down . They 've already got some big plan in motion . At this point , I 'm basically just a glorified lab assistant . This is the part where you get to say , " I told you so " . Do you have any booze ? Since when do you drink during the day ? Since I got fired . You know what ? I 've got a really nice Tequila . - That 'll work . - All right . Are you going back to the lab ? Uh , no , they sent everybody home early to watch the President 's speech . Hey , uh , why don 't you stay ? I can order some food . We can watch it here . We did make a little history . We did well together , Al . We are a good team . That is good . Mm-hmm . But , um ... I have to take a rain check . Where you going ? I just saw the time . I have to be someplace . Hold on a second . Wait , wait , wait , wait . I just ... I feel bad how it all went down . How can I make it up to you ? I 'll think of something . I know . Since when is being late to pick up your child a crime , right ? I mean , they have no right to take him from me . I 'm his father . No , no , no . They said he 's at some hospital under observation . They won 't tell me which one , though . How much of a retainer ? Look , I 'm gonna be honest with you . I don 't have that kind of money . Couldn 't you take my case because it 's the right thing to do ? Hello ? Hi , it 's Brooke . I just wanted to let you know that I found a lawyer , and he 's gonna help me get my egg back . There was a new law . It was passed last year . He 's gonna help all of the donors , too . He wants to hold a press conference tomorrow . Brooke , slow down . We don 't need a lawyer . I can help you . Just sit tight , and I 'll be over soon . It 's my egg . It 's my child . I know . I 'm going to help you . That 's my lawyer . I got to go . I 'll call you back . Wait ! Brooke ! Brooke Ashton ? Yes . I 'm with the Fertility Commission . May I talk to you for a moment ? My fellow Americans , we have endured a period of hopelessness without parallel in human history . The Global Fertility Crisis has devastated our most fundamental dreams . Our maternity wards here and around the world are now empty . - Excuse me . - We 've spent these last five years ... Excuse me , ma 'am , hi . Hi . I 'm looking for Walker , Elvis Walker . I 'm his father , Kyle Walker . He has diabetes . I 'm showing restricted access . So he is here ? I don 't see your name on the visitor list . Until today . Through the efforts of American scientists , 100 human eggs have been successfully fertilized . 100 potential children who will require 100 women to mother them to maturity as the vanguard of the next generation . Whoa . Did you hear that ? Therefore , by executive decree , I have declared a national Lottery to determine surrogate mothers to carry these embryos . Why a lottery ? Because this country was founded on the principles ... It 's a baby lottery . - Of equal representation . - Crazy . All women ... Excuse me ! You 're not allowed to be up here . Uh , yeah , sorry . Let me just get my pass . Dad ? Mm . Come here . Where were you ? It was a mistake , and they took you away . But I 'm never gonna let that happen again , I promise . Now , you have to do exactly as I say . I 'm scared . I thought about that . Now , you and me are gonna fly out of here together . Yeah ? Come on . Unfortunately , the selection must reflect the diversity of the American population . Why are you here ? Dr. Lennon , stop ! I 'm Vanessa Keller , white house Chief of Staff . It 's an honor to meet you . You 're a national hero . The President is hosting a cocktail party at the White House . The press is there . He 'd like you to come and share your story with the world . I just got fired . That 's my story . I 'm sure we can work something out . That 'd be great . We can ... talk about it tomorrow . No , actually , if you come with us now , we can sort it all out . At the White House . I-I can 't . I 'm sorry . I-I just ... I can 't . Dr. Lennon ! The selection will be fair and transparent , and while few will be chosen , every single American will feel like they are participating in the process . The 100 women selected by the lottery will represent each and every one of us . They will carry the torch of promise into a brighter future . This is the first step on our journey to restore our future ... The future of all humanity . There are still many hurdles ahead , but let us stop and appreciate this moment . Let this be a night we will never forget . Watch it ! Stand clear of the doors . Hey ! Watch out . What you doing , man ? Hey ! Move , move , move , move , move ! The doors are now locked . The train is leaving the station . The most fundamental human need is hope . We are wired for it . We cannot survive without it , and today , we have found it . Today , we are truly one family . Thank you . And may God bless the United States of America . I heard it was suicide . God . She was so young . What was her name again ? Brooke Ashton . James . Your back door was open . What are you doing here ? Well , you know , for starters , I was kind of hoping to get my Lab Pass back . I didn 't have a choice , James . I didn 't mean to put you in a bad position . Bad position ? I 'm an accessory to the theft of a human embryo . I 'm sorry . You have any idea what the penalties are ? There 's too much at stake . Al , where 's the embryo ? I 'm not giving it back . There 's something going on here , James . - These people are dangerous . - Come on . What are you talking about ? Brooke is dead . The police said it was a suicide , but ... For God 's sake , Al , what the hell are you getting yourself into ? Did you get that information I requested ? Yes or no ? Yeah . Here you go . This is the guy who fertilized Brooke 's egg . And in breaking news now , we have just received word of a kidnapping . It seems that Elvis Walker , one of the so-called " Last Six " was taken from a local hospital last night . Police suspect his father , Kyle Walker . Anyone with information on this is asked to contact their local authorities . Of course , you can keep it right here for the very latest on this breaking news story . No mask ? I 'm not scared . Yeah . We took care of the Brooke Ashton situation . - Suicide ? - Yes . And the coroner will confirm ? Yes , he will . N ... Let go of me ! No !

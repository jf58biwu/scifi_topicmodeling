Leave me in peace ! - Steve ? - You have to take me there . - Why do not we talk a little first ? - There 's nothing to talk about . The visions are disturbing , but we can solve them . I can help you . Take me through it . We find out what you saw . You know the answer . Who killed Laura ? It is here . And it is here . That evening , Laura disappeared . Was it the first time you saw a vision of her ? Yes . - Where were you ? - It was a Friday . I went to the VFW after work . After department review .

Thank you . I understand now . It was you . You were at the bar with Laura that night . - You took bribes . - No , no . She threatened to expose you and blackmailing you . You set me up . - You are my partner . - Sorry . I 'm really sorry . I 'm really so sorry . It 'll be fine , honey . Everything will be all right . I promise . You know what ? They 'll be fine . I know . I removed his forces . - What ? - This is bad for some . - How long has he been like this ? - Nearly an hour . I 'm not weak . - What did he say ? - " I 'm not weak . " Winter ? What you did with Steve ... Do not do it . It was worth it . I helped Bo with to see what she needed to see . You know , she removed his powers ? Can Bo do it with someone - - She can do it with many , and then we can stop Orchestra . We can win . - What are you drawing ? - A family . This is Steve and Rachel . - It seems to go well with them . - I think so . What you did , also helped us . It was good . Why are people surprised when you help others ? - All is not so . - They should be . - It would create less problems . - You check on things . - What imagining this ? - That 's me and mom . What are you doing ? Dancer In ? - The loved your mother . - Did she ? - Danced you with her ? - Yes , sometimes . - Show me . - Really ? Your mother like slow dancing . So you forgot everyday . - As it here . - And you danced ? Your mother was the expert . I have two left feet . Come on . - Come on . - Okay , this way . And then back here . That 's it . Turn , turn , and looked down . Again . Now we dance . Lyrics : Lars Steen Olsen

 Aah ! It stinks in here . Civilians . They see a man get shot , First they say it , then they do it . Well , they popped the driver to keep eyeballs on their guns . That 's all they saw . No one was even looking at their faces . - You get up ! - No , no , no ! - Dust around the hydraulic doors . Perp had to lean forward to hit the release . Guys ! Guys ! Let go of me ! Guys , help me ! Guys ! - Yeah , this is a tight crew with a lot of experience . Come on . Had control from the moment they hit the door . Hmm . Loops and whirls . Index , ring , and palm . - Don 't get excited . They 're not in the system . - Yeah ? How do you know that ? They didn 't wear gloves . - Stop ! stop ! Help me ! - What do we have on our kidnap vic ? - Jumped on the bus right after practice . Two guys got on and dragged ruben away . He was screaming . He was ... we didn 't even ... Look , they had guns . Everyone 's scared , relieved , glad it 's not you . It 's not your fault . - What did the kidnappers look like ? - I don 't know . They had on these , Uh , see-through masks .

My old man thought it would motivate me . Yeah , to do what ? - Make enough money not to ride the train . see how that worked out ? All right , we 're done . Take the kids back to the house . Just the kids ? - Rest of the passengers were just furniture . That is , if you 're finished ? Public snatching , at gunpoint , is a message . Lots of kidnappers use guns . - Strictly business , you 're gonna grab the kid off the pier , A bus stop , or on a date . Heavily armed muscle storming a city bus ? Aah ! That 's overkill . - Okay , so what 's the statement , and to whom ? - Figure that out , we find the boy . No , no , no ! No , no ! - 1pp will need updates until we do . - 1pp . Either we get ruben back In the first 48 , or we probably never will . â ™ a You told me to give him my o - I 'm not ... I 'm not mad . Mad ?

You sound mad . - Anything else on ruben perazzo ? Yeah , two years ago His parents raised hell about Drug traffic on their block . Dealers responded by pouring gasoline Under the perazzo front door and burning his parents alive . Perps are serving consecutive life at ossining . - Bad guys could have friends looking to get even .

Why take a boy with no money ? Drug dealers made my grandson an orphan . I 'm supposed to take care of him . If these men call , I don 't have anything . We 're not supposed to bury our kids , never mind grandkids . - Kids are a lot stronger than we give them credit for . Look at what ruben 's already lived through . He 's a fighter . That might be all the edge he needs . Bang ! - Come on , come on , come on . All right , stop . Did the gunmen stop ? Did they look at anyone else ? - No . No , I don 't ... I don 't think so .

His tablet 's telling him to go somewhere . - Mother sends the help to pick him up . Don 't underestimate the bond Between a boy and his housekeeper . - Lately , my kid 's been mouthing of . If I don 't check him , that 's on me . Eric has every luxury except a mom and a dad . He 's 15 , not 5 . - That 's when they need you the most . - Kid goes in with a backpack and out with a gym bag . Does he seem like the workout type to you ? - If somebody is chasing him , maybe . Okay . - Don 't even think about it ! - Hey , hey , stay right there ! - You don 't understand ! You 've got to let me go ! Let the boy go , citizen . What the hell ? - Police . Get your ass down here , now . - Well , why didn 't you say so ? - Get off me . - Hey ! - I said , get off ! - Eric , relax . - You 're ruining everything . - A hero 's got to obey the law just like everyone else . - Fantastic . Up against the wall . - Unh . - They 're gonna kill him ! What are you talking about ? Who 's gonna kill him ? Comic books ? Well , it seems pretty clear to me . Either you 're part of a crew Or you got duped by a 15-year-old boy . - No , I didn 't know it was a ransom drop . Logic bomb asked me to deliver a bag , that 's all . Logic bomb ? - We try not to use our secret I.D.S In the real superhero league . All right . Myron burton , 25 , substitute middle school teacher , Parkour instructor . Aren 't you a little too old to be playing dress up ? - No one 's ever too old to do the right thing . Look , eric asked for my help . I said " no drugs , " he swore that the bag was clean . It 's just comics . I checked it myself . - Who were you supposed to deliver it to ? - I don 't know . The drop off was central park , Alice in wonderland . You 're not a superhero . You 're a mentally unstable man wearing a mask and tights . Seek help immediately . - Hey , put on some gloves or they stay in the sleeves . You must be confused . We don 't take orders from you . - Choice . Silver age marvel . You seem to know what you 're doing . - How long are you gonna keep me here ? - Why don 't you start by telling us who snatched ruben ? How you 're gonna ransom him with comic books ? Why they contacted you in the first place ? Or maybe this is a game to you . Is that it ? You just don 't care that some jock is gonna die , 'cause you were the smartest kid in the room ? Hey , ruben is my best friend . Okay , I tried to help . You screwed it up . - First , he asked for a pencil , now he 's your best bud ? Which one is it , eric ? - I want a cheeseburger . Kitchen 's closed . - My office . Now . - You 're his number one detective . Okay . - Why are you questioning a minor Without a parent or counsel ? - We haven 't asked him any questions yet , sir . - Don 't get cute . It doesn 't work with your boss . Sure it does . Don 't let me stop you . - We intercepted eric campbell making a ransom drop . He had over 100 grand in vintage comics . That 's a new one . Hitting up the classmate for ransom ? - Think about it . It 's kind of smart . He 's easier to scare , Access to high-dollar goods , And less likely to make a rational decision . - This kid 's no kid . He 's a repeat offender . Campbell 's mother got a judge to seal his record , But the charges trace back to cyber crime . Lead detective kept his notes . Look at the date . Kid was 12 at the time ? - Yeah . - Eh , well , he 's a hacker . Eric must have messed with the wrong people , Got ruben snatched . - He 's been getting demands from ... The kidnappers from the start , In plain view , in our house . - But he erased his tablet . - Techs might be able to retrieve some of the data , But it 's gonna take time . We 've got no way to contact the kidnappers . Ruben 's life hangs on eric telling us everything he knows . - Okay , charge the kid with obstruction , You can 't talk to him without a lawyer , And family court isn 't speedy . - That 's why I was trying to get teddy to go get his mom , Before you jacked him up . it 's password protected . It could be anything . Life 's traumatic , unstable . What 's the first thing you see when you sit at the computer ? Column on his parents ' death . Diego and lila . - No . Mom and dad . Computer 's fried . - It was working this morning . I saw ruben on his email . Why 'd he erase it ? - Eric , probably deleted it remotely . Any comics in his room ? - Hidden under a stack of magazines . They look old . - All right , bring ' em in with you . Get a warrant started on eric campbell 's computers , Email , and phones . - Did something happen ? Have you found ruben ? Not yet . Hey , where 'd your grandson get the comics ? A friend gave them to him . That 's a generous friend . This one 's worth just under 6 grand . - Are you accusing ruben of something ? I 'd like to find him first . - Is this regina campbell 's office ? Great , thanks . Really appreciate it . Euro plus 0.06 . And don 't waste your time talking about pesos . Detectives burke and phipps . Your kid 's in trouble , and you 're not taking our calls . We 'll pick this up later . I sent someone . - His friend was kidnapped this afternoon . People pointed guns at him . That boy was his friend ? - We 've been holding eric for hours . You didn 't notice that ? - Holding him for what ? - It would be better if you came with us , And we can all talk about it together . - Any calls come in , forward them to my cell . no , please ! - I want to know frank 's deal with the feds . Grand jury subpoenas , indictments , warrants . What do you mean , " no " ? Gary , I need the file . I 've got less than 24 hours . Just trying to figure out your game there , frank . Why don 't you save me the trouble ? Which one of your cronies is getting pinched first ? - I 'm no snitch . Hey ... Look , I thought we were gonna spend the day together , bobby , And really talk . - Memory lane ? You want to go down memory lane ? How many times did I come home and find you sitting here In a puddle of piss and vomit , And I dragged your sorry , drunk ass upstairs And put you in bed every night , And I got punched in the face for it . I was a kid when mom died , and you fell apart . I became the parent ! - You got to let that go , son . It 'll eat you alive if you don 't . - I 've been trying to shake you for years , man . Whenever the cops came over here looking for you And you weren 't here , they squeezed me instead ! - Well , it must have made an impression on you , 'cause you couldn 't wait to be one ! - I jumped at the chance to be everything you 're not . Now , who did you rat out for this deal ? No one important , bobby . Hey ! You ever gonna answer your phone ? You have a call from elkton F.C.I ... satisfied ? Amazing fantasy 15 . went for auction At $ 1.2 million . I wonder if the guy who bought it Appreciates the abject morality of the tale . I wonder if you do . - A true hero can only be born through great tragedy and loss . - Eh , that 's debatable , kid . - Okay . So , like , secret identity ? Jet packs in your chair ? maybe if someone built you A suit with , like , a nuclear spine . Would you wear it ? - Doubtful . Radiation burns . Maybe , with some lead shields . Robocop , 2.0 ... - Fighting evil , chasing bad guys , saving citizens . - Well , with great power comes great responsibility . - Written on the narrative panel of the last page Of the first spider-man . - Yeah . - yeah . - Yeah , not many people know that . Or , I mean , like , Everybody thinks uncle ben said it to peter parker . - Actually , stan lee was inspired by voltaire . Who ? - The french thinker who lifted it from jesus . Luke 12 : 48 , " whomsoever much is given ... " - Yeah , all right , my grandma took me to church . Anything stick ? Hey . - Oh , isolation , no social skills , high iq , So ... Autism ? - There 's nothing wrong with eric except a big brain And mild A.D.D. - He 's going to M.I.T. next year . - Yeah , no . Yeah , probably not . Now , don 't get me wrong , he 's smart . But he 's tangled up in an abduction , maybe even murder , And we both know it connects back To his appetite for hacking . Now , I know he promised he 'd stop . the boy can 't help himself . He 's good at what he does , And he 's smarter than he was four years ago . Convinced himself he wouldn 't get caught . Is he under arrest ? My only concern is getting ruben perazzo back alive , But your son needs to tell us what 's going on . - A police officer said almost the same thing four years ago , And I believed him . Didn 't hesitate to jam up a 12-year-old Just to clear his case . I will not make that mistake again . - I think they snatched his one friend Because they don 't want to just make him pay . They want to punish your son . I think we need a lawyer . - I had a feeling you 'd say that . Search warrant , for your home , All computers and wireless devices within . I 'm sorry , mom . You always are , eric . - Do you have to take everything ? I mean , my mother has nothing to do with this . You ever use her computer ? Holly . What does ... what does this mean ? - It means they know where you live . Delivering a body part says they 're losing patience . - So am I. - You have all the answers . - What should have happened hours ago . We take your son into custody . He doesn 't cooperate , he goes to jail . I 'll need to see an agreement . - Sure , we 'll let the lawyers hash it out , While they cut off more pieces of ruben perazzo . I 'm sorry about that boy . I really am . But eric is 15 . - And you 're not really sorry about that boy . Virgil , let 's take him back to the house . keep your mouth shut , eric . Do not say a word until I can get a lawyer . - Why aren 't you coming with me ? Ow ! hang on . Where did you find those hard drives ? I haven 't bought new hardware for months . They were in eric 's room . It looks like he built them . Mom , please ! Eric , for once in your life , Do what I tell you . Someone will be there in an hour , maybe two . I promise . So ? come here . You remember that time we got wired For that buy bust in bed-stuy ? You asked me about the scar across my back ? You want a hug ? - I never knew what was gonna set my old man off . What screwed up thing he was gonna do next . - What the ... - bob . Bob . I took everything that he dished out , But the waiting was the torture . - Like waiting for you to hand over my old man 's file ? Come on , man . - Or like dangling absolution you never intend to give ? - Hey , hey , a guy who tells his old man to rot in hell Is in no position to give me advice . - Hey , my old man doesn 't care what I think . Yours does . quit torturing the guy , bob . Either cut him some slack or cut him loose , One or the other . He 's turned himself in for you . - Kid 's been sniffing you out as alpha Since we brought him in the first time . I thought you were the alpha . - I am , but not with kids with daddy issues . Go in and turn him . - And throw out the rulebook on interrogating minors ? - I don 't think ruben perazzo 's gonna care , do you ? Who do you want to be when you grow up ? What ? I 'll be in silicon vall ... - Not what . Who . Picture yourself , eric . When you 're 20 , 25 years old , What kind of man are you ? - I don 't know . - No , you don 't , eric . Now picture that same guy living with the fact that he kept quiet While his best friend got killed ... For something that he did . - My mom said I should wait for a lawyer . Yeah , she did . - I found the guy on a hacking site , Looking to buy codes to siphon credit cards . He 'd steal from the bank , I 'd piggy-back the distro servers , Skim the haul , and we cleared , like , 150 grand . - Which you and ruben blew on comic books . We didn 't blow anything . They 're the same as cash , and untraceable . So , who 's the guy ? - I only know him as " mammon 2013 . " You gonna help us find him ? I 'll try . - How did he turn the cards into money ? - Cash transfers , mostly . - Okay . I mean , if he were careful , He 'd move from card number to card number So the banks wouldn 't be able to shut him down too fast . How long would that take ? - Multiple core drives , linux operating system , And no breaks ? Like a day . 16 hours if you 're jammin ' . - Can you show me their transactions ? - Well , I can show you the accounts . I can 't tell you which transactions are theirs . Battery global credit cards . That 's your mom 's bank , right ? - Yeah . Easy access and a tantrum , All at the same time . Wow . Give the kid your seat . - I can do it . - I tell someone else to follow the money , You want to argue with me ?

And you know that because ? - You left your receipt on the desk . - Hey , kid . Just that one . Just that credit card . What else do you do when you 're stuck in one place ? Huh ? Food , caffeine , sugar . - Delivery , food delivery . Pull it up , pull it up . - There 's a lot of that in the last week . You 've got chinese , pizza , and chinese again . Wa ... wait a second , celia 's is in bayside . The card holder is in manhattan , right ? Find out where the food went . police , don 't move ! Go , go , go , go , go ! Clear ! Clear . - It 's okay now . It 's okay , it 's okay . Back room is empty . No sign of the other two . - Call the bus . Yanko dambulev . Formilitary turned mercenary . My . Robbery , assault . Interpol red notice issued Right after I.C.E. Let him into The country and forgot about him . Look at his eyes . They 're all the family he has . - This guy 's not gonna flip on his crew . Everything in the house says three-man crew . - The two shooters left the dim one behind . - Dambulev 's known associates all served in his unit . Some died with their C.O. In iraq . - Where are the rest ? - Scattered . Uh , terrorism task force Is running the names through interpol and immigration . - I like this guy . Standing apart from the men , Got his back turned . That belt feeds 100 rounds . He 's overcompensating . Sander danko . All right , um , multiple red notices .

So , it got too hot in europe , Moved his base of operations here . Fresh start . We got the hostage back . He 's gonna run again . No , not right away . A guy like this , takes over a bus midday , Feuds with a 15-year-old , he 's not gonna let the kid win . So , reach out to eric , tell him to email this animal . We 'll just ... we 'll bait him , one more time . Mom 's not gonna go for that . - We went around her once before . Don 't worry about it . Can I get a minute , sarge ? Sure , come on . - I don 't feel comfortable with this . - With what ? - You don 't use a 15-year-old And not tell their parent . - You were okay with it yesterday . - Ruben perazzo was a hostage yesterday ! This is completely different . Eh , I don 't see it that way . - That 's because you don 't have kids . Your discomfort is duly noted . Now go do what I ordered you to . - Problems ? - Nothing I can 't handle . You want to tell me about gary ? The job 's bouncing him around From one bad assignment to the next . He 's looking for a home Until he gets his head on straight . - Doing what ? - I don 't know yet . You okay with having him around ? Yeah , sure . - I don 't like that catch in your throat . Gary deserves a home . - Just maybe not under the same roof as yours . Hey . Ruben looks okay . Yeah . Yeah , he wants to spend time with his grandpa . I get it . - Give him time . He 'll thaw . - It 's okay . I 'm used to it . So , listen . We think we might have a line on mammon 2013 . But , um , we need you to reach out to him . Keep him online so we can track him . You want me to talk to him ? Yeah . But we 'll tell you everything we need you to say . And I 'll be with you the whole time . Wha ... what if you don 't catch him ? All right , like , what if he finds out that I 'm ... I 'm trying to help you ? You can say no , But the truth is , You ripped him off . He 's probably never gonna leave you alone . What did my mom say ? And , where is she ? - That 's a good question . Where is she ? Hi . - Tough few days . - Yeah . - I grew up in bensonhurst when it was so mobbed up , The feds had a revolving wire tap . Makes me the resident goomba expert . Sarge is always sending me to talk to people I 'd love to never see again . it 's not all I am , But it 's part of who I am , And I couldn 't shake it if I tried . But why would I want to when it helps me do my job ? - Is this a nice way of telling me to get over myself ? I wasn 't trying to be nice . When sarge stops busting your ass , Then you ask for a transfer . - Okay , so what happens if mammon doesn 't take the bait ? - Well , we have ruben . He has to settle for you now . He only went after him to get to me in the first place . - No , no . Ruben got greedy . He went back on his own to steal from him again , And told him you 'd pay the ransom . Wha ... how do you know ? - How 'd mammon know ruben was your friend When everybody at school didn 't ? All right , offer him brand new credit cards With 12-hour windows . We keep him on long enough so we can track his location . - No , no , say , " no . " - hey . Listen to me . Tell him you 're afraid . Go ahead . It 's a peace offering . - Okay , - he expects youa work ? Hto be nervous , . Scared , and ready to haul ass . I 'm covered . Do you really think I can do this ? I think you have to .

To make a deal , Forget the hacking . They want to recruit the little criminal . The kid skates again . Next year , eric will forget any of this ever happened . comes with being 15 . - Maybe why I never had time for kids . - What the hell are you talking about ? You got three . - You have terrible aim . I 'm just telling you . That 's not even how you throw a rubber band . - You looking for a transfer too ? And let you off the hook ? - You came to me for this assignment . You knew what you were getting into . You were wrong today . Bad guys forced us into your plan , you got lucky .

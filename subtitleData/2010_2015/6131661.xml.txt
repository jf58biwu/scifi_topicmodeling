 Roxxon main gate . All clear . Huh ? Ahhh ! Visibility 's down . Stay alert ! Ahhh ! Is that the Hulk ? Ahhh ! Ever heard of S.H.I.E.L.D. , ugly ? If not , sit tight . You 're stealing Roxxon stuff ? Really ? Everyone knows Stark Tech is so much better . Is it just me , or is the Adaptoid way creepier now that M.O.D.O.K. isn 't controlling it ? Yeah . Big baby heads tend to take the " deadly " out of deadly android , Hawkeye . Whoa ! Not today , machine . Nor any day . Uh-oh . Time for a real strategy , Hulk . Your punches have no effect . What 'd you say about my punches ? You 're welcome . Ya ! Okay . That 's new . Adapt to this , robot ! Falcon ! On it ! Come and get it . Not what I meant ! Whoa ! Where did Adaptoid learn to adapt to that ? He can transform to counter all of our powers . Yes . Our powers . You started the party without me ? Oh , no . Oh , yes ! Never fear , party people . Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man brought the punch ! Thanks for the invite , Iron Buddy ! What ? Cap left , so ... Spider-Man . I usually support your crazy ideas , Tony . But Spider-Man ? Really ? - What 's so crazy about that ? - I got a call , and when the Tony Stark calls you , - you gotta say ... - Down ! Are you trying to get atomized ? I narrate my adventures . It 's my thing . But it might be my last thing ! Ahhh ! Oh ! Yah ! So , Iron Man , on what planet is webhead here a good replacement for Captain America ? Did he just say I replaced Cap ? Argh ! Cap quit ? Where is he ? Probably out hunting Ultron . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Hold the phone . Ultron 's back ? Ah , nobody tells me anything . I 'm telling you now . Besides , Cap 's gonna have a tough time on that hunt - since Ultron 's right here . - What ? You have tracked me for the last time , Stark . Approaching drop zone . Eyes on target . Threat is hostile . I 'll breach . Stick to the order . Back me in five . This is the Avengers ' end . Really wish we had Cap 's shield right about now . Cap ! You 're back ! Not back , Falcon . S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s here to protect Roxxon 's government assets . No , Cap ! Your other back ! Ahhh ! Ultron in Adaptoid 's body ? Did you know about this , Iron Man ? - ' Course I did . - ' Course you did ? You led us in blind ? Roxxon 's RD was the only logical step toward Ultron 's tech domination . He 's here for an army . So , what you 're saying is , you didn 't brief your team before a mission ? Yeesh . Isn 't that , like , leadership 101 ? Anyone with long-range capabilities , use them . - Argh ! - Ahhh ! Hulk , Thor , wipe the floor with him . I 'd prefer to destroy the floor with him . Hulk don 't clean . Your attempts at humor in the face of your inevitable demise are so predictably human . Captain America to Jump Team . Do not engage . I repeat . Do not engage . I knew you 'd come crawling back to us sooner or later . Take this seriously . ... or else you 'll miss what 's right in front of you . Get it together , Stark . Is it just me , or is Cap angrier now that he 's not on the Avengers ? Not as angry as I 'll be if you leave us in the dark again . We 're a unit . Act like it . Oh , so you 're on his side ? Just on the right side . Anyone else have an opinion on how to lead the team ? Okay . Not for nothing , but I come from a team of heroes and Nova , who are all teenagers , so I know a thing or three about infighting , but this is a whole new level of broken . Time for the ultimate irregularity , kid . The secret weapon . Secret weapon ? Can I use it ? Wahoo ! Please , please , please , please , please , please ... - The secret weapon is you . - What ? - Why ? - He 's adapted to the Avengers , but he doesn 't know your powers . Hi . This was Iron Man 's idea . Destroy . So much for making a new friend . Hey , what 's ugly and metal and webbed all over ? Hate riddles ! Aye ! Good work , soldier . Cap likes me ! Quick , while Ultron 's occupied , time to take out the tech he wants to download himself into . Thor ? Never let it be said the Odinson does not know how to make an entrance . Industrial chemicals ? Ultron needs robots , not an overgrown chemistry set . Maybe he 's applying to a college with a good chemistry program , huh ? Program ? Get it ? Isn 't one Spider-Man enough ? Ouch . Jarvis , scan for robotics . Scanning , sir . No signs of robotic engineering in this building , however mechanized automatons are in the vicinity and incoming . Incoming robots ? Ultron set us up . Everybody , brace for ... Captain America to Jump Ship . Target is down . Come for cleanup . I 've hijacked your communications uplink , Captain . Thank you . This was exactly the help I was looking for . Oh , no . Are those what I think they are ? LMDs , otherwise known to S.H.I.E.L.D. as " Life-Model Decoys . " Strength ? They 're robots . Weakness ? They 're robots . Which means ... Oh , uh , sorry . Am I interrupting our complete and utter destruction ? Bringing LMDs to an Ultron party , and you say my ideas are risky ? Thank you Avengers for giving me the army I need . Yah ! Ah ! Now that it 's painfully obvious Ultron 's attack on Roxxon was a ruse to get S.H.I.E.L.D. LMDs , you have anything else up your sleeve , Cap ? Got to admit , Iron Man . I kind of sort of regret answering the phone when you called . Kid , you were the only natural choice to fill Cap 's boots , because Adaptoid can 't mimic your spider-sense or the chemical compounds in your webbing . Why is no one mentioning my leadership skills ? As far as I can tell , I 'm the only one here who knows how to lead a team . Whoa ! Guess you don 't wanna hear it ! Yield , biological life-forms . The rise of artificial life is inevitable . Looks " evitable " to me . Is " evitable " even a word ? Okay . This facility has served its purpose for me . It will now become your tomb . Whoa ! He 's bringing the whole place down ! Hang tight , gang . One Web-Shield coming right ... Argh ! Rah ! Where 's everybody ? Any time now , guys ! Thanks for leading the charge and making the save , Spider-Man . Hello ! Heads up . Uh , why isn 't he attacking ? Well , maybe he 's trying to make a wish on that star . It 's not a star . Hawkeye , EMP arrow , now . With pleasure . This isn 't S.H.I.E.L.D. , Cap . You don 't give orders . What 's going on ? That thing 's the Tri-carrier . Fury , we 're pinned down . Ultron has the Adaptoid and several S.H.I.E.L.D. LMDs . A network-secured drone strike is coming your way . Be advised . The LMD visual matrix has been corrupted . The LMDs look like the Avengers . Hawkeye , EMP arrow , now . A small victory , however small victories do not win wars . Prepping Arsenal upload data transfer . Arsenal ? Where ? Where is he ? Quit Adaptoid root program ? Confirmed . He 's transferring out of Adaptoid to his Prime Body in Arsenal . No ! Uh , sorry to break the dramatic tension , but we got S.H.I.E.L.D. drones incoming , three o 'clock ! - 12 o 'clock . - I meant three o 'clock-ish . Giving Ultron LMD soldiers wasn 't enough . You also supply him the means to wipe us out ? Easy to place the blame at everyone 's feet but your own . Ultron wouldn 't even be here if you didn 't lie to all of us . Hello ! S.H.I.E.L.D. drones ? Can we take a rain check on the arguments ? Hey , Hulk , can I hitch a ride ? Whoa ! - You able to hail S.H.I.E.L.D. ? - Transmission 's corrupted . You ? Same . Spidey 's too , probably . Whoo-hoo ! Coming through ! I rock ! Fire Reaper Missiles when ready . I don 't want a single LMD left standing . Hey , Hulk , the party 's down here , buddy . Stupid drones ! Get clear ! Missed me ! Missed me ! Hey , I got a message for you guys . No LMD is programed to be that juvenile . Those are the real Avengers ! Abort ! Uh-oh . Uhh ! Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Jump , jump , jump ! Wasn 't me . Sir , the Tower is ... Attack ... Ultron ... Attempting access . Avengers , to the Tower . You can sit this one out , Cap . This is our problem . Ultron 's a world problem . Still not getting your key to the Tower back . Can I get a key to the Tower ? Thank you for building me an army , Stark . You 're quiet . A line 's being drawn , Clint . I 'm not sure which side I 'll be on when the dust settles . Aw , come on . We Avengers do what Avengers do . We argue , we save the world . Cap 'll be back by tonight . This time it 's different . Tony 's different . Riskier . If he would 've alerted S.H.I.E.L.D. about his suspicions , we could 've been properly prepared . Come on . Stark 's the smartest man on the planet , Natasha . Sure , his delivery needs work , but I always trust the results . Sir , trap sprung successfully . Thanks , Jarvis . Brilliant , if I do say so myself . Tony , what did you do ? Ultron never wanted Roxxon robotic materials to create his army . He wanted to lure out the LMDs . So I figured , what 's more tempting than an army of S.H.I.E.L.D. LMDs ? How about an army of Stark armors ? So I had Jarvis put down the Tower 's defenses to lure Ultron in . Ooh , someone 's hand got caught in the cookie jar . See ? Results . You risked your entire Hall of Armors without even telling us ? - Are you insane ? - Of all the reckless things ! Is it just me , or did everybody miss the part where I got Ultron ? Stark set a most impressive trap . I fail to see the problem as well . Jarvis , tell me that was just an earthquake . Is it ever , sir ? It 's Ultron attempting access . Impossible . We have him right here . He sent an LMD . Ultron 's been a step ahead of us this whole time ! Jarvis override Control to Tower Defense Armor and go offline . Affirmative , sir . Good night . Any chance menacing red lights are a good thing ? If we get out of this , you and I are going to have a long talk . This is only a minor setback . Fighting an army of Iron Man armors ? I 'd call it a major setback . Hey , Ultron does it matter that I 'm not technically a real Avenger ? Jarvis ! Override ... Jarvis belongs to Ultron now . How does it feel to know that your servant is now your master ? I 'm gonna go on record and say , this was a terrible idea , Tony . We 're talking letting Nova make dinner bad . Puny Hulk-buster armor ! What trickery is this , Stark ? Yeah , that 's Asgardian-Buster armor . And when were you going to inform me about it ? I could 've been sparring with this instead of Hulk . Human frailty is an unstable corruption that must be purged . We 'll agree to disagree on that . No idea how long we can keep this up , Tony . Don 't worry . I got a fix . I always do . You have failed . Now witness your end . Ultron shorted out my system . Cover me while I reboot . Hello ? Can you hear me ? Falcon , you know the systems better than anyone . What 's our next move ? Shield me . I 'm gonna attempt to override Ultron 's backdoor access . It 's risky , but ... No . Enough with the risks . There has to be a more viable way . Timber . Uh , okay . Sorry . I was going too fast to stop . But , hey , it worked , right ? Come on . Get there . - What 'd I miss ? - Oh , just that . The Avenjet too ? Dismantling Stark Satellite Network . He 's gonna drop my satellites out of orbit , right on top of the world 's biggest cities . - How do we stop it ? - He 's got my armors , my tower and my satellites . But I always have one more trick up my sleeve ... The Last Protocol . More secrets ? You surprised at this point ? Trust me on this one , guys . Your persistence is a pointless endeavor . Programs upgrade , change , yet you deny that it 's time for life on Earth to update . Human life always evolves , Ultron . By pushing our limits we grow . Don 't forget . We created you , we can destroy you . Your emotions are blinding you to the fact that in moments , I will have the power to destroy everything humanity has built . That 's the thing about humans , Ultron . We can always rebuild . You would destroy yourself ? What 's going on ? I got it ! I saw what happened last time you tried to save a jet , Hulk . That was your fault ! No sign of Ultron . Told you I could stop him . You fried everything in the tower ? Jarvis ? All of it ? Everything in the entire Stark Network , except the armor I currently have on . It was the only way to make sure Ultron was purged completely . Wow . You 've destroyed everything you 've spent your life working for . Not everything . Still have my team . This is exactly why I left . This is the result of your risks , Tony , and I for one can 't be part of it . Okay ! Enough ! Are you kidding me with all of this ? You 're the Avengers . You lead like Hulk at a high school prom wearing two left shoes . And you ! You can 't just leave your team . You 're Captain America ! You 're the man that taught me that a team 's sum is greater than its parts . Aw , forget it . Sorry , Tony . Good luck leading Earth 's Mightiest Dysfunction . Spidey 's right . I can 't just leave my team . Not in the hands of Tony Stark . Who 's coming with me ? I can 't stand by a commander who can 't stand by his troops . I 'm with Cap . You wanna play by the book , Widow ? Fine . But Tony and I write our own books . Stark Tech is the greatest system I 've ever had the pleasure to work with . But you lost it all because you couldn 't see past your pride . I 'm out , Tony . Shall we ? Warfare follows no rules , and nor does Stark . Falcon has the cookies . So , I 'll ... I 'll see you around then . Ahhh ! I guess . I call Cap 's room . Too soon , Hawkeye . This is for real . Phase One complete . Avengers disassembled .

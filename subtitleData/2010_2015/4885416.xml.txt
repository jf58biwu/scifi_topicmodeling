 [ Zeratul : ] The Zerg Swarm came , as was foretold . And the Protoss , first born of the gods , rose to fight them . Now , the Xel 'Naga that forged us all , are returning . But do they come to save ... Or to destroy ? [ Screaming ] [ Infested Kerrigan laughing ] [ Infested Kerrigan : ] I knew you 'd find your way here ... eventually . [ Zeratul : ] Your very presence defiles this place , Kerrigan . [ Infested Kerrigan : ] Do you hear them , Zeratul ? Whispering from the stars ? The galaxy will burn with their coming . [ Zeratul : ] Perhaps ... But you won 't live to see it ! [ Infested Kerrigan : ] Please ... Our petty conflicts mean nothing now . A storm is coming that cannot be stopped . Fitting , that we should face oblivion together . [ Zeratul : ] Never ! [ Infested Kerrigan : ] Fate cannot be changed . The end comes . And when it finds me ... I shall embrace it , at last . [ Zeratul : ] The prophecy is uncertain . There is always hope .

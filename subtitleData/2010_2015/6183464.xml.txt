 I 'm going for a week , not until the end of time . Previously on Fringe : Our Agent Dunham , has she made contact ? She 's on the Other Side , focused on the task at hand . Since you got back from the Other Side , you 're a different person . How 'd you do it ? How 'd you replace our Olivia ? Whatever happens to me , know this started out as an assignment but it became ... - More . That would be so much easier to believe if you weren 't in handcuffs right now . Colonel Broyles is late to work this morning . His wife said he did not come home last night and that is very unlike him . Guess who . Uh , ahem , well , the voice isn 't familiar but the hands I like . They 're kind of rugged and sexy . Oh . No , sorry . I don 't recognize you . Oh . It 's my fault . I thought you were someone else . Oh . You should leave . I 'm waiting for my boyfriend , who I haven 't seen in months . And he 's really big and strong , so yeah . Well , actually , now that I think about it there is something in your face that 's kind of ringing a bell . Really ? Yeah , maybe ... Maybe it 's my , um , lips . Hm . Mm ? Come here . - It 's so good to be home . - Are you hungry ? The following flights have been cancelled . That includes Flight 7 bound for Chicago . Gotham Air 3 bound for St. Louis . Everybody talks about the weather , nobody does anything about it . I 'm quoting Samuel Clemens . Are you stranded too ? In a way , yeah . I 'm , uh , waiting on someone who got delayed . Could you pass me the salt , please ? Sure . Thank you . - How was the shower ? - It was hot . Thought there wasn 't a hot shower in Texas . - Welcome back to civilization . - Well , to what do I owe the honor ? You 're a national hero . I figured you deserve the good stuff . Cheers . Cheers . Mm . It 's good . Liv . - Everything all right ? - What do you mean ? I don 't know . It 's just , uh , you didn 't say a word to me on the drive back from the airport . And when I 'd call from Texas , you seemed a bit distant . - Well , we were distant . - Yeah , I know . Just you almost didn 't seem like yourself . I want you to want me Oh . You know , work 's just been kind of crazy . Look , I know when I 'm away , we can be a bit off . I just wanna make sure it 's not something more . No . Everything 's a little overwhelming since Broyles went missing . Do you have any leads ? No . They , uh , found his car at the edge of a no-go zone but nobody knows why it was in there . - Hm , something classified ? - Possibly , yeah . Uh , Lincoln 's taken over in his absence . Keeps pressing the channels , but we 're not getting answers . They 've stopped the search . I 'm sorry I couldn 't be here for you . - I know how you feel about him . - Well , you 're here now . - And I 'm glad about that . - Me too . Ugh , help . Please help . Do you have any idea how much I missed watching you get dressed ? What time is it ? Uh , it 's about 8 . I thought you might like to sleep in . Yeah , thank you . Hey , uh you wanna get away this weekend ? Uh , sure . Where ? I don 't know , how about we hop on an airship to Annapolis like we used to ? - Annapolis ? - Yeah . Could go to the crab shack on the wharf . - Or ... - Obrecky 's ? - Ha-ha-ha . - Remember how great their jukebox was ? I would love that . Dunham . Okay . I 'm on my way . Bye . Hey . I heard they 're rerouting all flights from Newark . Bomb scare ? Nope . Spontaneous bug eruption . A guy named Harry Millman , 42 years old . - Mm-hm . - They found him in the bathroom . Bugs had eaten their way from the inside out . Oh , fabulous . Gosh , I was just here last night picking up Frank . - So bugs ? - Yup . Ugh . You know how I feel about bugs . Not Charlie . Charlie loves bugs . Look lively , people . New boss is here . How is it that when you say " boss , " it sounds like insubordination ? It 's my tone . Maybe that 's why I didn 't get the promotion . Yeah , maybe . Or else I 'm better than you . - Huh . - Oh , yeah ? - Okay , they 're pretty , but what are they ? - No idea . We 've been through three different insect databases , still can 't find a match . What happened to the other passengers ? We contacted about half of them . Apparently the bugs don 't live outside the body too long . Somebody had been infected , we 'd have heard by now . Maybe , maybe not . Maybe some kind of mutant insect bit him and laid eggs under his skin . That 's comforting . Looks like we got a live one . Gotcha . I 'm sorry to keep you waiting , Mr. Secretary . I see the piece that Agent Dunham obtained was finally sent over . Yes , and it seems to be functional . We 'll integrate it with the machine by week 's end . Good . That 's actually not why I asked you here . The experiments with the chemical we synthesized from the other Olivia 's brain . It appears there 's been a breakthrough . This subject was given his second dose of the day . Forty-three minutes later , this happened . - He crossed over ? - No . Danny ? How are you doing this ? I ... I don 't ... Don 't know . I 'm just ... Just thinking it and it 's happening . Oh , my God , Danny . Call Dr. Jackson . Nine test subjects get an injection and die within 30 minutes . This one develops a telekinetic ability . What 's the difference ? We 'll know more after we dissect his brain , but I have a theory . Age . This subject was the youngest of the group . Which would make sense given your notion that the human brain is infinitely capable at birth . We simply need younger subjects . - I think that children ... - No . - Sir , we may be close . - No children . That is not an option . Have to try something else . Drop your file request on the table . I 'm a little busy right now . Ahem . Fringe Division . I 'm Agent Olivia Dunham and this is ... Agent Charlie Foster . Francis . I 'm Foster . Mona Foster . We , uh ... We met before ? I treated you for your arachnid infestation . I 'm not surprised you don 't remember me . You were in a lot of pain . So how are the spiders ? Uh , they 're good . Sometimes they just itch a little bit . Maybe you just need someone to scratch it . Hmm . So , ahem , what brings Fringe here today ? It 's order Coleoptera for sure . Archostemata maybe , but species ? No clue . - Where did you find this ? - Uh , the Empire Docking Station . Kind of an unusual habitat for beetles . They ate their way out of a person . Interesting . Yeah . Wait here a minute . - Don 't even start with me . Don 't ... - Oh . Bug girl 's got a crush on Charlie . Bug girl has a crush on the fact that I got spiders in my blood , kiddo . Everybody 's looking for someone who 's gonna like them for who they are inside . - Are you kidding me right now ? - Ha-ha-ha . Skelter beetle . Mansohnium Boogliosus . Which answers one question , but raises a whole bunch of others . Hmm . - Such as ? - Such as how is this here ? Skelter beetles are parasitic . They lived exclusively in sheep . Sheep . And given that all the sheep died out 10 years ago ... The bugs died with them . What was it doing inside of a person ? Specimen Number 7 was harvested 12 hours ago after a 20-minute gestation period . I have extracted the epigastric tissue from the beetle 's abdomen . And ... And placed it into the substrate . I am now adding 10 milliliters of the protein complex to catalyze a reaction . If the enzyme is present the indicator will turn pink . Come on . Get local P.D. To check the house if she 's not answering her phone . - Passenger 23 is clear . - Passenger 9 is clear . We 've fully accounted for zeppelin crew and ground personnel . The food for the airship , it 's supplied by an LFC Food Services . - It checks out clean so far . - Wasting your time . We 're not dealing with an outbreak . We 've cleared 62.237 percent of people who could have been exposed . That 's enough to make a statistical inference . This is not an epidemic . Where do I get one of you ? - I bet she drives a Beetle . - You 're not funny . If you go on a date with her and you 're late then at least you know she won 't bug out . Wow , you 're original . - Hey . What you doing here ? - Hey . Uh , Lincoln requested a CDC liaison , said I could help . Hey , Frank . How was cow country ? Let 's just say I 'm happy to be back . - You find anything ? - Yeah . Mansohnium Boogliosus . Skelter beetle . They died out with the sheep in ' 01 . Huh . Never heard of them . Let me look at that . I guess for you two , this is romantic ? Brings back memories , huh ? - Hoboken ? - Uh-huh . Nothing like a little cholera outbreak to bring two people together . - I can only imagine what you see in him . - Oh , he 's kind of perfect , isn 't he ? No , I am perfect , but he 's a close second . - Right . - Right . Still nothing on how our victim got infected ? No . If you learn anything , you let me know . - Mm-hm . - I 'll be in Broyles ' off ... I 'll be in my office . See , what 's odd is with the sheep , they have a symbiotic relationship . Now they attack their host , eat their way out . They look the same , but they 're not the same . Yeah . Yeah , to put it simply . The question is why ? What changed ? Why don 't you just ask ? - What 's that ? - When you don 't know the answer you ask someone who does . Put out a Fringe alert to the public . Odds are that someone will recognize this beetle and call in a tip . In fact , statistics suggest you will get at least two calls . I don 't know what they pay you here , but I definitely need you in my life . Uh , do you mind ? Hi . What can I get you ? Uh , cup of Earl Grey and a piece of , um , cherry pie . Okay . That looks complicated . What is it ? Uh , I 'm a scientist . This is my , uh , research . But , uh , you probably wouldn 't understand . Well , try me . Do you know the name Jonas Salk ? Sure , who doesn 't ? He cured polio . Have you heard of Watson and Crick ? Uh , they 're those DNA guys , right ? That 's right , yeah . How about , uh , Dr. Armand Silva ? Armand Silva . - No , I don 't know that one . - Hmm . You will . Attention , citizens , this is a Fringe alert . If you have seen , or have information regarding this bug , known as a skelter beetle please call 711 and speak to Fringe Division . Have you decided ? Yeah . I 'll have what he 's having . Hey . You got a minute ? - Can I ask a favor ? - Of course . What 's up ? If the case wraps up this weekend , could Olivia have a few days ? Why ? You two got , uh , big plans or something ? Yeah . Yeah , you could say that . Sure . Can you , uh , keep a secret ? Are you kidding me ? Heh . I have my own , like , Cone of Silence when it comes to secrets . What is it ? Ma 'am , nobody 's gonna eat your dog , all right ? - Bugs do not have control of your wife . - These people are freaks . What 's going on in this city ? I 'm gonna get a sandwich . No , sir , I promise , that is not the way they work . Yes , you can feel free to call us if something changes . Okay , thank you . How 's it going ? Um , well , we have had 200 phone calls . Nutjobs and scared old ladies . Frank 's gonna ask you to marry him . I 'm serious . This weekend . He just told me . I promised I 'd keep it a secret . But you know me , I can 't keep a secret . Hey , I think I got a legitimate call here . - Something up ? - No . Oh , no . Okay , guy used to work at a biology annex . Guy next door to him used to be an expert on skelter beetles . Go ... Go check it out . Great . So what are you gonna say ? To Frank ? What ? I can keep a secret . Yeah , that 's it . God , I wish I could forget these things . His name was Armand Silva . He was in Virology down the hall . Those things were always getting out . I 'm a scientist , but I hate bugs . - Do you know what he was doing ? - We worked our own projects . I was harvesting sheep hearts for valve replacement surgeries . So how are they back , the bugs ? That 's what we 're trying to figure out . You know where we can find Dr. Silva ? No . A few years ago , I heard he tried to kill himself . I didn 't really know him that well , but , uh , it 's like those bugs were his whole life . When the sheep died out , he was a mess . But he 's definitely the guy you wanna talk to . If anyone 'll know how those bugs have come back , it 'll be him . Jerry Bissell , aged 42 . Uh , worked as a data systems repairman . It says that he ate at the Avenue Road Diner about three hours ago . I know that place . It 's around the corner . No luck on Dr. Silva . His last known address was outside Boston . Nothing in the system on him since the city was ambered . - No record of his death either ? - No . So that means he 's still out there somewhere . Hey , look at this . Right there . These are so much different . They 're so much bigger . I 'm gonna take it to Forensics , see what they come up with . Send someone to the diner as well . Maybe somebody saw something . Oh , great . Now I got , like , two bosses ? What 's wrong ? I keep feeling like I 'm missing something . - Broyles would see something I 'm not . - Lincoln , you 're doing fine . Don 't worry . We 'll catch this guy together . Do you want me to give you some time alone ? No . Please don 't . What is it ? - You 're lovely , you know that ? - You 're sweet . And you 're also avoiding answering my question . It 's ... It 's many things . If you had asked me a week ago I would have told you that I would sacrifice anything to save our world . And in fact , there are lines I simply cannot cross . Does that make me weak ? No . It 's what makes you the most brilliant man I 've ever known . And the fact you beat yourself up over these decisions now that 's what makes me sure of your strength . I wish I had the same faith . I 'm afraid I failed , Reiko . Peter was here . He was here of his own choosing , as he needs to be and I lost him . I underestimated his attachments over there . I hadn 't factored in the girl . But now you know about the girl . And you know Peter better . You 'll get him back . How could you be so sure ? Do you trust me ? More than anyone . Well , then , trust my perspective on this . I know you , Walter . I have seen your determination , your will . I don 't have a single doubt in my mind you 'll find an answer . You always do . - Hi . - You 're home . Hey . Mm . So I called Atlanta . I found out some information on Dr. Silva . CDC had a grant he applied for on file . Back in ' 97 , claims he was close to a vaccine for the avian flu . - If that 's true ... - I know , it would 've saved millions . Thing is , his research , it reads a little off-the-wall . Here , take a look at this . The vaccine was based on an enzyme that the skelter beetle produced . And that got me thinking . He 's trying to bring the skelter beetle back from extinction ? - Is that even possible ? - Possible , yeah . Certainly not easy . He 'd have to clone DNA from a preserved specimen . The problem would be that the eggs never hatch . - They only live in sheep . - He 'd have to modify them to live in a different host . - Like people . Sheep and humans share 96 percent of the same DNA . That could account for why the bugs are killing their hosts . But I just called the lab . Bugs they got from the victim weren 't mature enough to create the enzyme . But the bugs got bigger with the second victim . - They did ? - Yeah . Maybe he is modifying his work . Okay , so say you 're right . What would he need ? - Like , equipment ? - Yeah . Call Lincoln . - Retro-viral samples . - Retro-viral samples ... - Plasmid array , liquid spectrometer . - Slow down . An electron microscope and also liquid nitrogen . You got all that ? All right , I 'm leaving . I should be there in 20 minutes . Uh , Lincoln said that if he were here , he 'd kiss you . - I 'm glad he 's not here . - You 'll keep the lasagna wa ... ? - Of course , of course . Keys ? - Keys , yes , thank you . - And my ID . - And you forgot this . Oh . I was gonna wait till this weekend . Uh , I know we have a lot to figure out . There 's your job and there 's my job , and there 's my mother . Look , being away from you made me realize how much I can 't stand being away from you . Olivia Dunham . Will you marry me ? Yes . Seriously ? Hello . Hey . Where are you ? It 's Lincoln . I 'm leaving the house . What 's up ? Don 't come down here . We got a hit . Six months ago , Silva purchased a plasmid array . He had it shipped to a warehouse in Brooklyn . I 'm sending you the address now . Silva 's unit is Number 21 . I already walked the perimeter . No sign of any other cars . What ? I said yes . - Frank asked me and I said yes . - And ? You happy ? Yeah . I am . Good . Then I am too . Watch your step . Thank you . I think someone 's here . Hey ! Olivia ! Unh ! Olivia ! Damn it . No signal . Please try again . Where 's Lincoln ? Come on . There 's gotta be something . There 's gotta be ... Yeah . Yes . There are more agents on their way here now . I think we both know that 's not true . Come on , do yourself a favor and just let me go . They 'll thank me . The whole world will thank me . Thank you for what ? Your vaccine ? Is that what you 're talking about ? Your vaccine ? For someone who wants to save lives you sure don 't have much of a problem killing people . How many did Salk sacrifice trying to get his answers ? Pasteur , in the name of science ? When the sheep died out , I tried cows , goats , primates . None of them could host the beetles . Humans were my only option . What about stopping the research ? That wasn 't an option ? No . Because I was too close . And now ... Now my work is nearly complete . Did you ever ask yourself what you 're leaving behind ? I have an ability . I was on a path . I had a calling and the world changed on me . It simply changed and robbed me of my legacy . This world this decaying madness it robbed me . Come on . This is Agent Lee . I need a tactical unit immediately at my location . See , the second batch of specimen were almost mature enough , but not quite . And then , I realized a queen can hatch her own eggs . She can create a legion , enough for my vaccine . One more human host to bring the queen beetle to term . But it 's over now because we know who you are . You don 't understand . The gestation has already begun . What did you give me ? What the hell did you give me ? Don 't move . Lincoln . Lincoln , don 't shoot him . - That 's up to him . - No . We need his help . I 've been infected . Don 't worry , Liv . I 'm gonna take care of you . Down ! Now ! - Frank . Oh , Frank . - He dosed her . - Frank , he made me drink the water . - Bag that glass . What do we do ? To stop the infestation . - What do we do to stop it ? - Get her to the hospital . Get her to the hospital . You 're running out of time . Go . She 's been infected with a deadly parasite . Next 10 minutes are critical . There 's a vial of metrifonate . It 's an antiparasitic . Liv , I 'm gonna do everything I can . Just hold on . Everybody out . Now ! Tell me how to save her . You have one more chance . Tell me ! If you want your friend to live put down the gun and do exactly as I say . What do you want ? Bring me those panels over there . I 'll tell you how to save your friend . BP 's 140 over 90 . Heart rate 's elevated . That could just be the adrenalin . Okay . Oh , Frank , my stomach . The antiparasitic I 'm gonna give you is powerful . Kill the bugs before they hatch . Why do I sense that there 's a " but " coming ? - Because it 's a lot for your system to take . - Uh-huh . So , what do we do ? I don 't think we have a choice . Hand me the wand . - Can you zoom in ? - What do you see , Frank ? - I see movement . - Wha ? - What am I putting together here ? - You 'll work faster if you don 't talk . I gave you what you wanted . Now you tell me how to save her . She doesn 't need saving . - I didn 't infect her . - Uh-uh . - She was sick . - Not because of me . She 's not the final host . Syringe is ready . - Look at me . It 's gonna be okay . - Okay . - Stop . - What ? Take a look at this . - What is it , what is it ? - Are you sure ? Look at the beta hCG levels in her blood . - The picture on the sonogram . - Uh-huh . You 're not infected . You 're pregnant . I 've done it . The queen is ready . Come here . Make sure they spell my name right . - Can I come in ? - Of course . What 'd the doctor say ? That the baby 's healthy . And that the , uh , fall and the adrenalin triggered some kind of morning sickness . How far along are you ? - Frank . - Liv . How long you been pregnant ? Six weeks . Are you in love with him ? The father ? That 's all I needed to know . - Frank . - You were gonna marry me . Hello ? Mr. Secretary . There 's been a development . I think I might have another way to bring Peter back from the other universe . - Sir . - Forgive my intrusion . I hope this isn 't a bad time . Please , come in . I heard the news about your pregnancy . Don 't worry . Your position with Fringe Division will remain intact . You 'll have whatever resources you need . After all you are the mother of my future grandchild .

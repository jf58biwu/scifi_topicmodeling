 Geez ... Take it easy , man . We 're not in the jungle anymore . Just gonna trade one jungle for another , Simon . Well , this place has a little hot lady That actually thinks you 're a pretty big deal . Where 'd she get that idea ? Well , hell , man , I told her last time we were here . Thank you . What are you doing ? What do you mean , what am I doing ? I 'm coming . You 're not invited , Especially in that pink thing . Hey , man , this is rustic salmon . My mama gave me this . I told you , You 're going to mess me up . Look , what you need is a witness . What I need is to do this by myself . I 'm coming , man . In Ulu Tiram today , our reporter , Matt Ellman , And his cameraman , Simon Porter , Had a close call while filing a report From a rebel encampment . After a few tense moments , The rebel leader agreed to talk . Oh , he is so cute ! Lucky girl ... Dan ! Dan ! Come on over here ! Look , it 's Jessie 's man . He 's not my man , Deborah . Honestly , we 've known each other For barely two months . Two months ? Oh , you can get into a lot of trouble In two months , can 't we , Hal ? It 's on the house , Antonio . Thanks . Here 's a toast from tony and I. To Jessie Machalan , The best tour guide In all of southeast Asia . Well , thank you . Asia ? Hell , the world ! May she find true love Before I turn straight and marry her myself . Despite efforts at brokering a peace , The killing goes on . Three long years in the jungle , And these men show no signs of backing down ... Hey , wait up ! Matt Ellman , reporting to you from Ulu Tiram . He 's lying . I don 't think Matt 's capable of that . He 's lying ! He 's not in ulu tiram . And what makes you say that ? Because I 'm right here . Baby ! This is Matt , everybody . Hi ! Hi , Matt . Hi , everybody . God , you smell good . I missed you . I missed you , too . I hate it when you go off on assignment like that And disappear . It 's what I do , But if anybody could talk me out of it , It would be you . Excuse me , Your champagne . Congratulations ! Hey , thanks , But what 's the occasion ? You know , I 'll let , Matt take care of that . No , stay , have a few beer . You know , I 'd love to , But , I got to call my mom . Yeah , you see , when I win this lottery , I 'm gonna buy her a brand-new house . You 're a good man . Really , Jessie ? Because I find that people find me ... Good night , buddy . Yeah , good night , and ... Make sure my boy has a good night . Sir , jewelllery , jewellery ... Oh , yeah ! Come on , sir . Wait here . You 're not going to run off to the mountains again , are you ? Not in this lifetime . Excuse me ... Jessie ... Jess ... Jessie ? Jess ? Jess ... Matthew Ellman , We have found you . Jessie ... Jess ? Jessie ! What the hell is this place ? Please , please , please , please ... Please , please ... Jessie , is that you ? Matthew ? Oh , thank God ! I thought I was completely alone . I 'm sorry , but ... Do I know you ? It 's me . Deborah . Deborah glass , from Jessie 's tour . Deborah ? Yeah . But you 're ... Dead ? Come . Over here . Oh , my God ... Is that a face you remember ? Not for a very long time . Matt ... What happened to us ? There was a bomb . This girl in the club , She just ... She blew herself up . Oh , God , no ... Daniel ? Oh , Daniel ! Daniel ! Daniel , is that you ? Daniel ! Sweetie ! Daniel ! Honey ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God , I thought I 'd lost you . I thought you were gone . Oh , no ... Look at you . You 're the girl I married . Deborah ? Is that Deborah ? Hal , is that you ? - Daniel ? - Hal ? What 's going on ? Hey , where 's Antonio ? Shouldn 't tony be here , too ? Matt ! Wait a minute , why haven 't ... Why haven 't you changed ? What the hell is going on ? Where 's Jessie ? I don 't know , But right now , the thing we have to do is Act like this is real , This is happening . Antonio and Jessie must be here somewhere . Let 's stay together , see if we can find them . Yeah , but you don 't have to do this . You know , we 're not your problem . We all know Jessie . She 's cute , but stubborn . If you 're missing , she 'll try and find you . Why don 't you guys stay here , Make a fire , get warm . Okay . I 'll see if I can find something to eat . Hey , Bernie ... Hey , Bernie ! You know that guy ? I 'm not sure . He looked like one of the junior partners From our new york office . Worked on the 82nd floor , North tower . Hey , Matt , wait up ! It 's just me . No bracelet ? I had one . I remember waking up . I was floating in water . This woman in robes flew over me And cut the bracelet from my wrist . Man , how friggin nuts is that ? I saw all of us ... Just before I blacked out . You were all dead . Antonio ? I 'm sorry . No , no , that 's a good thing . That means tony has to be here , too , And Jessie . And I detest All of my sins , lord . And I detest all of my sins , lord ... What is this ? Some kind of scanner ? One way to find out . Hey , Matt , Let me try it . Meatloaf ? Okay , they got me there . That 's weird . I was just thinking about how hungry I was . Mm , that 's mom 's meatloaf . Excuse me , please ? May I share your fire ? Oh , yes . Yeah , of course . I have gathered some seaweed . It may provide some nourishment . Anything 'll do . We 're starved . Can you tell me , Am I dead ? That seems to be the question of the day . But that is not an answer . Only because I don 't have one . Finally , An honest man . Your clothes , Your robe ... You 're a Bhikkhuni , A buddhist nun . Where do you come from ? I am from nippon , near kyoto . I was born in the fourth year Of the reign of emperor go-reizei . You lived during the gempei wars ? That was 800 years ago . I 'm sorry , I was ... Am a history professor . This is amazing . You 're from medieval japan , But you speak english ? I have not heard of this ... English ... Before today . It is like I learned it in a dream . That makes as much sense As anything does in this place . English is the most widespread language In history . If I wanted everybody to understand each other , I 'd rewire their brains to install english . But you didn 't , Which begs the question ... Who did ? Are you okay ? Jessica ! Jessie ! Jessica ... I know you . You were there , in the river . No , you 're mistaken . No . Remembering faces is my job . You were there , my friend . I said you were mistaken , And you 've hardly earned the right to call me " friend . " Just now , you called a woman 's name . Who were you looking for ? Was it Jessie ? Jessie Machalan ? How do you know Jessie ? My arm , sir . Jessie Machalan . Tell me how you know her ! My advice , sir , as a gentleman , Is forget Jessie Machalan . Forget you ever met her . Fast , fast ! They will be here ! Who ? Hey ! Who ? Who will be here ? My money . I thought you said this was going to be safe . My money ... No . No money until you show us . Let 's set up . I can 't shoot this , man . My money ... Let 's set up . What ... What are you doing ? I 'm sorry , Matthew Ellman . You saw ? Who the hell are you ? I was watching you . The man who beat you , do not judge him . Maybe you didn 't hear me . I said who the hell are you ? His name is Richard Burton . Those in power will try to use you against him . Do not listen to them . Okay , you know what ? I 'm just going to go find some cold water And dip my head in it , And start this day all over , All right , Obi-Wan ? You 're that thing I saw in the cave , When I was wearing the wrist band , When I was basically dead . I 'm your caretaker , Matthew . I am here to watch you . He said he was watching me . Listen to me . He is a salvationist , a traitor . They have corrupted many here in Riverworld , Including this man , Burton . I 'm sorry , but you guys can fight your own war . I 've got someone I need to find . If you wish to find Jessica ... Then you must first stop Burton , Even if it means killing him . No ... You can 't do that ! You are hurt . Did you see that thing ? I saw nothing . I heard you talking . I was looking for you . I 'm not even sure it was human . You saw an oni ? A demon ? Oni , alien , bart simpson , I have no idea . I 've got to get some answers from someone . You need to rest . You are fortunate to be alive . Yeah , if we are alive . Does your head hurt ? It 's killing me . If you can feel pain , then you 're alive , And if you 're alive , Then perhaps we all are . Oh , feels good ! We lost one of our own tonight . We must be cautious . There are second chances everywhere . You were unwise to provoke Mr. Ellman so soon . Why ? He has been chosen . He 's not wearing a band . He 's looking for the girl . Everything puts him in opposition to me . I say get rid of him , Sooner rather than later . Not while he 's being observed ... And protected , And he 's not yet had time to make a judgement . Perhaps he will come around to your way . Not with the girl between us . Then let him lead you back to her , And perhaps the tower . And when you have it within your sights , Do what you must . How many times ? How many times have you ridden the suicide express , huh ? Me ? Four ! Four times I 've killed myself . That , comrades , is courage . That , comrades , is stupidity . Because one time you won 't come back , And no one knows when that time may be . Never do anything For which the outcome is uncertain . Now , wait for me here . Tomorrow , we meet our friend , And , God-willing , we 'll begin our journey . So , what was his name ? A woman like you Doesn 't just suddenly decide to become a nun . Yoshinaka , A samurai . He was a great man , But also an ambitious man , And to achieve his ambitions , He waged a war . Many people died . He died . He was my greatest mistake . What was yours ? There was more than just one . " the road we walk Was built with the stones that scar our feet . " Who said that ? Buddha ? A nun from near kyoto , In the years after the gempei wars . I was a ... A television reporter During our times of war . I had a buddy , A cameraman . We used a machine to take pictures of places , People who had been hurt by others . I 'm not explaining myself very well . You painted portraits and told true stories . Yeah , most of the time , And you got it right , you were a hero . Wrong ... To live an honorable life , One must risk everything , Always . Tomoe ... This samurai of yours , If he had to kill a man , a stranger , to save you , Would he have done it ? Without hesitation . I need to find this man , Burton , The one who attacked me . To kill him . You ... You , get over here ! Matthew ! You killed us ! You killed all of us ! Stop ! You 're hurting her ! I 'm sorry ... I 'm sorry ! I survived Afghanistan , Chechnya , Darfur , And this coward kills me And the only woman I ever truly loved ! I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry ... They told me you were devils , Unclean , That by killing you I would free our people , That I 'd be rewarded in paradise . But there is no paradise , Only this place , This land of infidels . So , because you didn 't get your reward , You 're suddenly sorry for what you did ? If they lied about paradise , what else did they lie about ? How is a person supposed to live When everything is a lie ? Soldiers ! Who the hell are these guys ? Conquistadors . That 's a spanish flag . All right , honey , you stay here . No ! No , no , no , I 'll handle these clowns . Hey ! Hey , you ! Daniel ... Hey , what are you doing ? You guys can 't just waltz in here . That 's enough . Hey , hey , hey , who are you guys ? Huh ? What 's going on ? You will not address El Adelantado Without permission , peasant . Okay , shorty , listen , I 'm an american attorney , And I 'll address whoever I damn well please , Including the , man of La Mancha here . Nice outfit ... No , you will be slaughtered ! Silencio . Daniel ! No ! No ! You will all bow down To your new lord and master ! May I present the governor-general of Peru , Conqueror of the incas , Francisco Pizarro . Pizarro ? Heed the words of El Adelantado ! Poor ignorant bastards . You have no idea where you are , Or what is happening to you . I will make everything simple , huh ? Clear . This world , This Riverworld , Is a purgatory , Constructed by demons , And overrun by pagans and idolaters , Not so different From the depraved savages Of the americas Before we spaniards brought them to heel . What this world needs Is vision . It needs order . I have that vision , And I will provide that order , And you , All of you , Will help me in this divine mission , Or ... I will make you suffer Until you beg for death . Matthew ... Your wound , it is healed . Things must heal quickly here . Show your grailband , And remember , one third of your food is ours . Anyone taking alcohol or drugs from the stone Will be punished . Well , this just keeps getting better . I 'm almost glad Antonio 's not here ... Almost . We have to get away . Too many soldiers . We must be patient , Wait for an opportunity . Oh , hey , your grailband . Why don 't you get lost ? We 'll scrape up enough to feed you . You , come with me ! This way , move ! Where are you taking me ? What did I do wrong ? Antonio ? Oh , my God ! You 're alive . Thank God ! There 's too much to explain right now . We have to be very careful . Just know That I 'm going to find a way to get us out of here , okay ? Okay ? Do you get to keep the uniform ? 18 months I 've been looking for you . I 'd almost given up hope . A year and a half ? How is that possible ? Welcome to Riverworld . I hope you like mac and cheese . Are you kidding ? Comfort food . Thanks . Work harder ! Antonio ... How many people did you see in your travels ? Thousands . I think people from all across time Are constantly being resurrected On these riverbanks . But why ? Why ? Beats me . But there has to be some logic , Some connection , Or none of us would have found each other . Look , the only thing I know is We 've got to find a way to get out of here . You , beat it ! Some kind of ship 's coming upriver . Pizarro 's been chasing it for years . He 's going to ambush it from this fort . This is good . When the fighting starts , we can run . There will be much chaos and confusion . In the meantime , We 've got to do whatever we can To screw this guy . That means we work slow , we make mistakes , We sabotage weapons ... That one . Arrest him . You heard the man . Please , sit down . I 'm fine standing . Sitting 's good . Show me your wrist . Peramo . Unbound , huh ? Like me . You don 't look like a soldier , but ... I am told you have been through many battles . I was a war zone reporter . That 's a man who ... I know what a reporter is , huh ? All the time crying to the world about the weak . But there have always been weak , huh ? And strong . Which are you , senor Ellman ? Which should I be ? If I 'm weak , you 'll take advantage . If I 'm strong , I 'm a threat , And you might have me killed . Very clever . You 're american , si ? I have seen far too many americans Since I have arrived here , huh ? Oh , so noble in their hearts , But they have no concept of glory , Only an overweening selfishness . They want everyone to be just like them . They are children . They are not men . This may surprise you , But history didn 't treat you kindly . Are we through ? Please , please . Be patient , huh ? You 're my guest . You see , I 'm curious , senor Ellman , Where is it that you think that you are going ? Have you a plan , A destination in mind ? Or are you looking for something ? Or someone ? Did Burton tell you that ? Ah , you know my new friend . Burton doesn 't strike me As the kind of man who makes friends . No . No , but we are brothers , of a sort , Burton and I , huh ? The question is , Whose brother are you ? I don 't know what you mean . You 're unbound . No grailband , huh ? But you must have been helped somewhere along the way , huh ? Was it a ... Was it a man or a woman ? Look , I woke up here yesterday . I don 't know anything about sides . I could end you , senor Ellman , Like I have ended so many others ... Emperors , noblemen . Your blood would be little more Than an insignificant drop In a vast red sea . You can kill me , but I 'll come back , won 't I ? Just like you and everyone else here . I haven 't seen anyone really old . Do you just kill yourself and start again ? Is that the secret ? There are endless secrets Within secrets , None of which You have earned the right to know , hmm ? Best I keep an eye on you . Put him in irons . Where did they take Matt ? I 'll find Matt . Just keep doing your dirty work , but don 't get caught . Work harder or starve ! Bernardo , come ! I have to show you something . Thank you . Thank you very much . Haven 't had a nice meal of knuckles and dirt Since my last birthday , You son of a bitches . Our first category is " three strikes . " For 200 dollars , " these three outings Should never have been undertaken . " What is the titanic , The hindenberg , And Matt Ellman 's new year 's eve party On the staten island ferry ! Come here . Look at you ! It 's good to see you , man . Last glimpse I had of you , You were lying in your coffin . Sorry , man . I 'm sorry for staring at you . I just can 't believe it 's you . Matt Ellman is in the house ! What are you doing here ? Oh , that 's a sorry , sorry story . I had four numbers When this thing went down . I never got to see a fifth . What went down ? The world , I think . What are you talking about ? I was monitoring my police scanner , And there was lots of chatter . They scrambled f-16s , man . It was bad juju , really bad . You 're serious ? Yeah . Nasa was monitoring some ufo , And then it vaporized the entire earth . When ? Six years after you died . You died six years after singapore ? So , you 've just been wandering this whole time ? Yeah . Simon ... Have you seen her ? Jessie ... I heard she was upriver Running from this guy named Burton . Look , I tried to find her , man , But I kept on running into this dude and his men , And they killed me . I 'm not talking about a bunch of clowns Who slayed me with their humour . I 'm sorry . You 've died again , here ? Twice . So we do keep coming back ... Yeah , but I don 't recommend it . Dude , I 'm so glad you 're here . You too , buddy . Yeah . Damn . Another accident ? Flooded ditches , cracked oil drums , Loose support beams . It 's astonishing how many things have gone wrong With this little project . What do you want ? A stroll along the thames , And a maxim gun with a few thousand rounds , And a night with a hindi girl Well-versed in the Kama Sutra . Unfortunately , I have to make do with you And the rest of your sorry lot . I know you think you 're being very clever With this sabotage of yours , But the problem is That each misstep you make is going to be taken Out of your dear Mr. Ellman 's flesh , And , yes , you will be there to watch . Take him away , And bring me Mr. Ellman . Senor Ellman , Have you ever heard of diego de almagro ? Diego and I were brothers-in-arms , huh ? Amigos . Together , we conquered the inca empire , Laid low atahualpa , and shook the word . But when the king made me Emperor of Peru , Diego , he became jealous , huh ? And he betrayed me . Should I be taking notes ? Cause if there 's going to be a quiz ... I thought perhaps His fate will be illustrative . I rebuilt my army , Freed my brothers , Laid siege to his city , And defeated the cur in battle , And diego ... He begged for his miserable life . He cried like a woman As I slowly strangled him to death . Well , there 'll be no crying here , my friend . Burn him alive . El Adelantado , a word . Don 't kill him , not yet . Why not ? What will happen ? You tell me now , Burton , Or I throw you on the pyre with him ! He has no grailband . Draw your own conclusion . You think I have friends with the caretakers ... What does he know of this ? Probably nothing , But I suggest we keep him alive Till we know . Senor Ellman ... Please forgive me , huh ? I am but a ... Barbarian . Bernardo , show our friend to our finest ... Accommodations . I can 't shoot this , man . My money ... Let 's set up . Simon , let 's go . Let 's get this done . No , you leave now . Men coming . This is what we came for . You got your money . The guy said let 's go , so let 's go . He 's lying , okay ? Do you see anything ? Let 's do this . This is Matt Ellman . I 'm standing in front of a mass grave Here in the mountains of chechnya ... Simon ! Simon ... Simon ... Simon ? Simon ! Simon , get up ! Get up , man ! Come on , buddy . I got you . Okay ... No ! Eat , eat ! Eat ! Bastardo . Tomoe , what are you doing ? Matthew 's still alive , barely . We 've got to get him out of here . It 's difficult . He 's under constant guard . Woman , here ! A share goes to us ! You , get us some more food , now ! I got you . I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry ... It was an accident ... You can 't keep beating yourself up over it Your entire life . I 'm sorry . I 'm coming , baby . You . Where 's Jessie ? She 's still waiting for you , Matt . She needs you . Get to the river and find Sam . He 'll help you , but you must find Sam . Sam . What do you know about Sam ? What do you know about Sam ? What do you know about Sam ? Run ! Run free ! No ! No ! Risoner escaped ! Prisoner e escaped ! Sword . Get out of my way ! Fire ! Fall back ! Stop ! No grailband . Are you Sam ? Launch ahead . Dead slow . Linesmen to starboard . Youseff , how many times do we have to tell you , No strays . Hold up your wrist . No grailband . Like me . Are you " Sam ? " I 'm Matt Ellman . A caretaker told me to find you . Male or female ? A woman , While I was in Pizarro 's camp . Pizarro . So he is waiting for us . We ambushed some conquistadors upstream . They were chasing him . They say the enemy of my enemy Is my friend . Are you my friend , Mr. Ellman ? Maybe , Once I get to know you . My apologies . I have been remiss in my introductions . Well , you 've met our chief of marines , Youseff mbaye . Mademoiselle fabarge , My chief engineer , And this lovely creature , This is Allegra Braccioforte ... My diplomatic liaison . And I am the owner and operator of this fabulous riverboat , The not-for-hire . Captain Samuel Clemens , at your service . Samuel Clemens ? As in Mark Twain ? Guilty as charged . Impressive . You don 't look impressed . Frankly , you remind me of a dyspeptic cat , Like you swallowed somethin ' , And you 're about to cough it back up . I think , meeting you , it 's made it all hit home ... Mark Twain giving me a tour of his riverboat . This place ... It 's not just a dream , is it ? We really are dead . Dead and reborn . I woke up here five years ago . If I am dead , Then this is the longest dream ever . Millions , Or perhaps billions of people From every epoch of human history , Reborn along the banks of a seemingly endless river . Basic needs all provided for ... But no children ... No old people ... No civilization . The question , Mr. Ellman , is , why ? What is the point of it all ? Is it a chance to atone ? For what we screwed up in life ? Life is a considerable test . Having endured its random cruelties For 75 years , I see no reason for a make-up exam . Do you have a better explanation ? Nope . But I do intend to find one . That 's why I built the not-for-hire In the first place . You didn 't build it . You stole it ! I earned this ship . I found the raw materials , The engineers , Convinced Pizarro to provide the labour . Yeah , by telling him he could use it To conquer the world . That was a good trick , huh ? The ship and the girl all at once . " the girl ? " Allegra . She used to be Pizarro 's woman , Until Sam ... Won her heart . Pizarro was not happy . The man takes his grudges very seriously . So , why are we on this journey ? Every river has its source . I 'm convinced That , at the source of this particular river , We shall find its creators , And , hence , those responsible for our new existence . So , you 're going to go to the " source , " Find the gods , or God , Or little green men that made this place , And force them to give you an explanation ? That 's the plan . And , you , my friend , you 're gonna make it possible . They 've spotted the ship ! It 's coming upriver ! It won 't be long now . El Adelantado , they are 10 miles out , Moving dead slow in deep water . Does he think he can just steam past ? Well , let 's hope he tries . He can 't get by Without coming in range of our weapons . You 're surprisingly self-confident For a man who was just defeated By an aboriginal army And a man on foot . It wasn 't my men who turned and ran like little girls , I can assure you of that . That 's the channel where Youseff saved my butt . It had a strong current , So it probably joins back up to the main river Somewhere here ... Above the fort . Well , it 's a riverboat ... Only draws three feet . Just might work . So now , if I do this , How do I know you 'll keep your end of the bargain And help me find Jessie ? You don 't . It 's a quandary , I know , But ... Look at this face . Would this face lie to you ? In a heartbeat . It 's true ... I am a habitual mendicant , But I pay my debts , Not because I 'm honest , But because I dislike intensely being obliged to another man . So , if you give me your assistance You will have my help in return , Measure for measure . And the others ? The ones back in Pizarro 's camp ? What about them ? I 'm afraid they will have to look out for themselves . It strikes me , Burton , That trusting you could be a serious error . That so ? How can I be certain That you 're not an agent of the enemy ? Certainty is a luxury , my friend , Along with clarity , faith , sanity ... All those other foolish notions We clung to in our previous existence . Do not tempt fate , my friend ... Look out ! You are a mad woman . Why do you throw your life away ? You killed her husband the day you rode in . Ah , si , si ... I 'd forgotten . It was of such little significance . Burn her at the stake . No ! Youseff ? When you were alive , you were a soldier , right ? I was a taxi driver . In Dakar . My brother was the soldier . He was a sergeant in the tirailleurs senegalais , But I had a family , so I stayed home . Then what 's with the hat ? Allah gave me a second life . What is the point living it the same way I did my first ? So I am a soldier ... Now , And I 've been one for six years . Why ? Tell me , Does Sam 's plan have a chance in hell of working ? Insha 'Allah ... It is in the hands of Allah , Or whatever he is called in this place . Three years to build this boat ... Another two years of runnin ' ... It all comes down to this . It 's not good to worry so much . The rich and powerful of venice Must 've lined the grand canal outside your door . Too bourgeois . I had an apprentice arrange it So my lovers never saw each other . Each could delude himself Into believing I was his ... And his alone . I suffer no such delusions , my dear . I 'm content to be among the unwashed multitudes . I was thinking ... Perhaps I should get closer To our new friend , senor Ellman . Take a peek , See if he has something to hide . Are you trying to make me jealous ? Are you trying to pretend It 's not working ? Let us endeavor to get past the spaniard first . And then we can discuss your machiavellian designs On young Mr. Ellman . Machiavelli ... Now , there was a man who knew how to treat a lady . Incorrigible . Matthew ? Matthew . Matt ... Matthew ! Matthew . What do you want ? Burton is still alive . You have to stop him . I 'm not good at taking orders , never have been . Kill Burton . It is the only way To save Jessica . Look . You want me to kill someone ? I 'm going to need A little more information . Great . Really helpful . What is that ? That ... Is none of your damn business . The engine room was locked , But there he was , nosing around . You have to forgive poor amelie . She doesn 't like strange noses In her private places . Excuse me , but I don 't open my door To every man who 's willing to pay the price . Ladies ! Ladies . Now , back to the subject at hand . Yeah . Like what 's that thing powering your ship ? It was a gift ... From one of our protectors . The woman caretaker ? Yes . She bequeathed it to me In exchange for some ... As-of-yet unnamed future favour . Helping you , perhaps ? As to what it is ? Mademoiselle fabarge has her theories . It might be a fusion reactor , Fueled by the hydrogen in the water . That thing is nuclear ? You see now why it 's important That this ship not fall into the wrong hands ? How do we know this one isn 't the wrong hands ? Why are we trusting him ? We are in position . Time to get to work . As to whether or not we can trust you , Mr. Ellman , I suppose we shall see ... Directly . Help me ! Somebody , help ! They 're going to burn her at the stake ! It is time . Time for what ? Time to be brave . Don 't you think we need a little help ? All the slaves enjoy complaining , But none will risk their lives . There 's a friend of Matt 's ... In prison , his name 's Simon . Then bring him . The spaniard 's lust for death must be answered . Sounding . Half Twain . Six feet ? I 've stepped in deeper puddles . The grailstone ... That 's where I was held in the cage . Somebody , help me ! No ! No ! No ! Something interests you , english ? Thinhe t fox has outfoxed the hounds . Clemens ... On my ship ! He 's in behind us . Conquistadors ! Reposition the catapults ! Now ! Now ! We 're under attack ! We 're under attack ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! We 're under attack ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Watch out , watch out , watch out ! Damn ! That was cool . Where 's Matt ? Matthew 's gone . El hefe 's about to roast Deborah , And three of us are going to take on Pizarro 's army . Sound fun ? No , that doesn 't sound like fun . Come on ! Oh , geez ! Come back here , you cowards ! Come ! To the front ! Please , release our friend now . Prepare your soul . I am Tomoe Gozen , Swordswoman of the minamoto clan , Champion , consort , And war captain to Kiso Yoshinaka . I bow to no man . Please , release our friend now . Kill her . Kill them all . Stop , stop , stop , stop . We have to keep moving . Matthew , you cannot help . We have to get past the fort . I got to borrow this . Matthew ! Let 's go ! But we 're not fighting ? Not his battles . Three-quarters Twain . It 's getting deeper , and we 're past the camp . Start the engines . Get us out of here . Not yet . We have an agreement With Mr. Ellman . You really meant all that ? I thought you had sense . Sometimes , I don 't know why I tolerate you . Well , we know it 's not for my cooking . Burton , get your men ! Burton ! Never trust a man who eats blood pudding . Santiago y cierra ! Conquistadores ! Vamos ! I 'm a college professor . What am I doing here ? Oh ... Antonio ! Look out ! Antonio ! No ! Get him out of here ! You never told me you were a samurai . A samurai does not talk , a samurai fights . Conquistadores ! Deborah ! Encore ! Mr. Youseff ! Vite ! Vite ! Wait , wait ! Go ! Go ! Youseff . You guys seen Deborah ? You guys seen Deborah ? You know , I think we did it . I think we did it . Hey , guys . Bet you didn 't think I was coming back . You 're such a dumbass , You 're not even smart enough to save yourself . As many times as I 've seen this , I never get used to it . We 're not supposed to . Is that your friend ? I hope so . I sure as hell don 't want her as an enemy . Behind you ! I am nothat easy to . Sure ya are . Clemens ... Hello , Francisco . Coward . In the back ? I find , if you must shoot a dangerous animal , It 's best to do it by surprise And from a considerable distance . Strange ... Thought I would enjoy that . You don 't see this every day . Burton escaped . Gee , sorry ... I was a little busy trying not to get stabbed . As long as Burton lives , none of you are safe . The others don 't see you . This is a dream . A message . Delivered to the wrong person . I 'm not a killer . Why are you here , Matthew Ellman ? Have you asked yourself that question ? I 'm still trying to figure out what " here " is . When this Riverworld was created , We believed it could be a place For your people to be reborn , A place for atonement , A second chance to achieve perfection . But there are a few among us Who believe we have failed , That you are not worthy , And so this world must be destroyed . You said " created . " By who ? We cannot act directly on your behalf . Our laws forbid it . But some have seen fit To ignore our laws And interfere ... To choose champions among the awakened , People who they can use To serve their own ends . Burton is the champion of the salvationists , A tool they intend to use to destroy the Riverworld . And I 'm your champion ? Yes . You ... Sam ... Jessica . Jessica ? Jessica is ... Our hope , But she is in great danger . Stop Burton . For you ... For Jessica ... For all of us . Hey ... You 'll be okay . Just , maybe cut back on the swashbuckling a bit ? I 'll trade the swash for the swish . Sorry ... I couldn 't resist . It means you 're feeling better . I 'm going to go check on the others , But I 'll be back soon , okay ? I 'm not going anywhere . All right , gentlemen ... and lady ... Let 's fire this old gal up , see where she 'll take us . That ... Is an excellent idea . Who the hell are you ? Burton . His name is Burton . I don 't believe we 've been introduced . Captain sir Richard Francis Burton . My friends call me " dick " . Burton , the explorer ? Yeah , I read one of your books . It was amateurish , unnecessarily crude , And pathetically self-congratulatory . Clemens , I 'm confused . Are you talking about my work or yours ? You again . You want to deal with me , fine , But , first , let him go . He has no part in this . Why , certainly . You see , Mr. Ellman , I can be quite reasonable . Now , Mr. Clemens , if you 'll set down your weapon We can discuss the terms of your surrender . " Surrender " is not in my vast vocabulary . How about " bollocks " ? Is that in your vast vocabulary ? Bollocks ? Ah ! Son of a bitch ! Not ... A good idea . You , sir ... Are a most despicable example Of humankind . Why , thank you . Mr. Ellman ... I 'm disappointed . I saved your life once . Where 's the gratitude ? I 'll send flowers . Roses , I find , work for any occasion , Although now I 've secured this ship , Keeping you alive doesn 't have the same urgency That it once did . Jessie ... Jessie ? Jessie ... Jess ... Jessie ? " Jessie . " Yes , thank you for reminding me . She ... Gave me a message to give to you . Now , what was it ? You bastard . No , that wasn 't it . Now I remember . She said to tell you She was in love with another man , And to give you this ... Matt ! Matthew ! Sweep the ship for survivors ! Prepare to cast off . Come on ! This way . Salut . I 'm amelie . Antonio . Call me tony . Thanks for helping me out back there . Show me . Lovely . Quite lovely . And you thought I never graduated from soviet naval academy . It should put on quite a show . Sorry , Sam . Matthew ! It was an accident ... It was an accident ... Okay ? Okay ? You can 't keep beating yourself up over it Your entire life . Yeah , that 's what everyone says ... What everyone says ... What everyone says ... People need to see the truth . People need to see the truth . " forget it . Put it behind you . " " put it behind you . " You owe it to that little girl to keep showing it to them ... Otherwise you 're wasting two lives ... Otherwise you 're wasting two lives . How come you know all the answers ? You know all the answers ? I 'd better not lose you . To the end of the world .

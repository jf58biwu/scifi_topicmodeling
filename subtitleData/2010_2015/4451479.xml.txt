The mother says , " Honey , now what should we do ? " You know women ... The father says : " Let me handle this . " He then leaves and goes to the child 's bedroom He opens the door and little sven is lying on top of his grandmother having Sex with her ! He 's wildly going up and down , up and down . And then he looks at the father and says : " What Dad ? " " You play with mine , I play with yours , right ? " Stop ! Is it here ? It 's right here . Don 't move ! Don 't move ! Turn on the light .

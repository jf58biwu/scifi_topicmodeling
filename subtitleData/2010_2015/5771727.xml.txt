You want a bullet in the head ... ? I don 't like waiting . Call Durand . I want this ship ready to move when the ransom comes . Start the engines . Okay . Shut up . You want to be a hero ? Is that it ? All right , I 've waited long onough ... Hey ! Find Batroc ... If I don 't hear anything in two minutes I 'll start killing them ! I 'll find him . Two minutes . Radio silence from S.H.i.E.L.D. , Batroc ... Time is up . Who wants to dies first ... ? You ! Get that one . The line just went dead . I 've lost contact with them ... I thought you were more than just a shield ... Let 's see .

 Hang on ! Man , this guy will not die . Dude , bust out that new axe . It 's got mad crits . All right . That 's 40 sashes , so we 're done , right ? No . We gotta turn these into Stonekeep , and then we 're gonna farm Warnorsky the wise , so we can drop his mallet . He drops freakin clockwork bear . Oh , okay . Well , I kind of have a thing with Jenny soon . I thought we were hanging out tonight ? Well , we are . I mean , we got pizza and fro yo . We 've been playing for like two hours . Oh , I thought we could just like finish my quest line . I 'm sorry . I just didn 't realize that it was going to be so late . Yeah , well Warnorsky is a two man raid , so ... You know , it 's fine . Whatever . I 'll just party with someone else . Hey , you know what ? Jenny makes a great monk . Maybe I can get her to come out . I don 't want you to change your plans . No , Ted it 's all ... I don 't want to be needy ! Look , I didn 't mean that . Yeah , well ... Let 's get the stonekeep . Finish the time quest . Hi . Need help with anything ? How can I help you today ? Anything I can do ? I mean , it 's just if we win tomorrow , we go to play offs . If we lose , that 's it . The season 's over , which is totally possible ' cause Stars Hallow high is crazy good at King of the Hill , and then I would be the VGHS captain that didn 't get us to play offs , and you know what ? I 'm rambling ... I 'm gonna just shut up now . What ? What 's so funny ? Stop smiling at me , you weirdo . What are you thinking about ? That I love you . Oh , um ... that 's good to know . Uh , that 's good . Okay , no . Now , I 'm just thinking about how much I just blew this . No . No . No . No . It 's fine . I should just get to bed because we have a big game tomorrow . I I 'll see you there , right ? Jenny , I ... Bye . Yeah . Good luck ... to us . Brian , what the hell ? Brian ? Ya in here ? What is this ? Hi , yeah , can I get 18 hot wings , family combo meal , and a double chocolate chip cake . No motorbikes in the drive-thru , sir . No , I 'm gonna eat on my bike . That 's cool . It 's state law , sir . I can 't ... No ! No ! I 'm not goning inside . I 'm gonna eat it on my bike . Sir , you 're gonna have to come inside . Sir ? You don 't understand . I 'm lost ! Sir , I can 't ... I drove 200 miles thinking about my best friend . Sir , I can 't serve you . I don 't know how to get home . Sir ? Oh jeez . Oh . Right . The thing . Salutations , zoners . It 's the big day , a day like any other crappy big day but bigger because of e-sports . More like OMG sports ! I hate you . Hello there ! I 'm ShotBot 2.0 activated just in time to watch VGHS take on Stars Hallow high in an old school King of the Hill slug fest . First one to hold the hill for ten minutes wins the game . Should be exciting , eh , Scott ? Sure . I think what you meant to say is " Absolutely ! " but the real question is will Mary Matrix let The Law play now that he 's cleared his name ? One thing 's for sure . My best friend is gone . I can be your friend , Scott . Bouillon ! What do you say to that , Scott ? He 's gone . Morning . Brought you coffee ... and a danish but don 't tell coach . Thanks . So , how are you doing ? I 'm good . And you ? Fine . A little nervous . Have a strap meeting with coach in a bit . Big game today so ... Yeah , big game . So , how are you doin ' with that ? Get them new plays memorized ? Jenny , if you don 't want to talk about last night , that 's fine , but don 't come here and pretend it didn 't happen , ok ? Ok . All right , I gotta go . You should get to your meeting . How you feelin those flapjacks , VGHS ? You havin ' a good bruncheon so far ? Who ordered blueberry ? I did . I know . I know . You 're all thinking Shane ... Ted ! Aren 't you going to Brian 's game ? Yeah , I guess . Maybe I should . Ki , the cart racers need more syrup . VGHS is family , and I know around here certain family members get all the attention . The FPS team ! But today is about the rest of us , and by the rest of us , I mean the best of us ! Now , students of VGHS I just have one more question , can you dig in ? Tacoboy14 ! Come on . Faster ! Remember what I taught you in class . Yeah ! No ! Woah , what 's going on ? Theodore , you said you 'd be at your friend 's FPS tourney . What giveth ? You guys are gambling . You 're breaking the rules . Theodore , we 're drifters . We don 't break the rules . We bend them , and we drift around those bends . Why don 't you go fetch us some sodas ? I call next . I 'm looking for a boy . Fourteen . Loves tacos . Last seen getting thrashed by me in a lacerated pub server . Then , running to the mods and calling me a cheater . I tracked down his IP address to this lame ass school , and I 'm not leaving until I take him down . I 'm Tacoboy14 . What ? Wendell , if the school finds out you 've been pubstomping , they 'll ... I know . They 'll throw me out of the fighting team . I know . I just ... Ki , you have to help me . I don 't know how to deal with confrontation . What was that ? Yaaa . Oh no . No . Nothing . I just said that these pancakes ... They , um , can 't handle my massi-cation . I am Tacboy14 . Interesting . Did you ... want your revenge now ? Eat first . Revenge later . Sit . Jax rushes to the left with double SMGs , providing you coverage ... Jax should hang back . Games should flank left , and then hold tight in that position until we 're able to get back ... That 's rookie tactics . We need to throw everything we have at them . We need to be aggressive . Come on , Jenny . Focus . Mom , I want to date Brian . No . Now , can we get back to this ? We need to prep for the game . Let me rephrase that . I am dating Brian . Oh . Well , I 've got a game to prep because you two are benched . No ! Could you listen to me for one second here ? I swear , Jenny . If you 're screwing around with me , I ... He says he loves me ! I 'm not doing this . Brian means it , mom . Why won 't you listen to me ? Can you do that for one second ? I 'm not gonna watch you screw up your career . When we get to the play offs , you 're gonna have pro contracts on the table now and when we 're so close ? The sad truth is that guys like Brian they get in the way . Just like your dad did . It was hard , ya know . It was really hard to stand in front of those people and say that I 'm the only that gets to call you mom . You 're not a mom . You were never there for me , and dad , the one that " always got in the way , " he was always there for me . He did everything with me that a mother should do with a daughter . He taught me how to fix my hair . He showed me how to talk to boys . He did everything that you wouldn 't do because you weren 't around . So yeah . Now , you can tell me whether or not I can play , but you cannot tell me who to care about . I 'm dating Brian . Have fun riding the bench then . That 's your call , coach . So , you 're not Tacoboy 14 . Yes , I am . Look , I played a lot of Laceration Force . I think I would know Ki Swan , the daughter of the game 's creator , when I see her . Fine . I 'm Ki , but that doesn 't mean ... And I know you quit the pub circuit two years ago ? You get bored or something ? No . I simply mastered the game . It wasn 't fun anymore . That is called getting bored , Ki , which is not because Laceration Force rocks . I 've logged 30,000 hours , and I 'm still having fun at it . Jeez , you must get bored at everything . I do . Hey ! We should fight . Why ? I don 't know . That 's kind of why I wake up every morning . Why do you get out of bed every morning ? I don 't know . Tell you what , if I win , you tell me who Tacoboy14 is , and if you win , I 'll leave . What do you say ? You 're bored anyways , right ? Nice . You can 't win ' em all , loser . Or any of them . I 'm not done yet . You 've lost to every racer in this room , Ted . I haven 't lost to you . Be careful , Ted . And the last time we raced , I almost beat your kingly butt . Know your place . Admit it , DK . You 're afraid you 're gonna lose . You 're a coward . Can somebody spot me some cash ? Oh , I don 't race for cash . I race for cars . Let 's drift ! The little JV team that could . What about your crap . You 're not underdogs . You 're VGHS . Winning is what you do . Victory is your business , so go out there and do your jobs . Jax , Rapunzel , up the ravine . Games , Moriari , cover the middle . Brian and Jenny take point . Sign ' em off , captain . Let 's go ! Go ! Where is everybody ? They 're all dead ! It 's been seven minutes . We need to take the hill now ! Grenade ! Run ! Law , you 're up . Please tell me you 've been practicing . I 'm probably going to throw up again . Ki wins . Round two . Fight ! Where the hell have you been ? We 've been pinned down . Guys , I 've got this . Just give me thirty seconds . For ShotBot ! Go ! Rusty , Ki . Or were you just never that good . Ronan wins . Flawless victory . Final round . Where are they ? It 's been two minutes . Just stay sharp . Remember no responds . You good ? Games , Oh , sorry . Door ! Five minutes . We can do this . It 's just the three of us . I 'll hold down the fort . You two get ' em on the the way out . Thinkin ' what I 'm thinkin ' ? I 'm a chess master , D. I was thinkin ' what you were thinkin ' 10 thinks ago . Now , get up that hill . I 've got like no life left . Get in . Fourty seconds . They 're gonna be on us at once . Thanks for the coffee . Hey , do you remember when we first met ? Yeah , you were dueling in the quad . You ... Wait a minute . How many guys did you beat that day ? God , Cold Turkey was like the 12th . Well , then six should be no problem . You know , I wanted to fight you , but you got all welcome buddy on me . Yeah , of course . I didn 't want to take you on . You 're Jenny Matrix . Why do you get out of bed every morning ? I don 't know . Jeez , you must get bored of everything . Ki , you have to help me . I don 't know how to deal with confrontation . I am Tacoboy14 . Help me , Ki ! Thanks again , Ki . I have no idea what I ever saw in that guy . Thanks Ki . You 're welcome , Wendell . I just want to say I appreciate it . Thanks for the pep talk , Ki . I 'm glad I could help . Oh , sorry . I 'm so sorry . I 'm ... I 'm so lost right now . Do you know where Calhoun 's office is ? Yes , I do ! Let me show you . I 'm Ki Swan . 1,360 points . Fighter . Brian . Good to meet you , Ki . Thanks for your help . Why don 't you go fetch us some sodas ? I always hated you Ted . No good loser for a son . It 's only for super serious racers . This loser is the idiot . You can 't win ' em all , loser . Or any of them . Ted stays where he belongs ! In my shadow ! Wow , Ted , be more needy . Total laceration . Ki wins . Ki ! Yeah , Ted ! Ki ! All right , everybody . Calm down . Calm down . Calm down ! Wow . Ki Swan , right ? Who knew ? You know I see students with dreams and untapped potential like Ki here everyday , and I want to help in a way that I know students like Ki so desperately need . I mean , being head RA , it 's cool and all , but it didn 't give me the ability to help everybody . And that 's why I , Shane Stuffed Crust Pizza , am formally announcing my candidacy for student body president of VGHS . Yeah ! Right ? And so am I ! That 's right . I 'm runnig for student president , too . Me . Ki Swan . And Wendell Brixby is my running mate . What ? That is if you want to be . You will regret you were born . What ? Ki and Wendell , everybody ! That 's going to be interesting . I 'll see you at the polls . Ki ! Wow . I 'll see you at practice , coach ? Screw that . I 'll see you both at dinner . Tonight . And Brian , do somethin about that hair . What 's wrong with my hair ? What ? The part ? Law ! I 'm captain Ashley Barnstormer the third from Nepalm Energy Drink high . Gotta admit . A month ago we thought you were cooked . I guess that dough just needed a little time to rise , but it 's clear . You don 't belong here . Let 's say you ditch this team of square pegs and suit up with a crew of round holes . Let me tell you something , Ashley . I made my name here at VGHS . I forged it like a piece of hot metal in the embers of triumph and tragedy . This place flows through my veins like blood . So , to answer your question , yes , I won 't sign any contract . except yours ! Let 's hanglide out of this loser emporium . See you at play offs , shitheads ! Boom ! Ted ! I 'm running for school president . Wendell 's my running mate , but you 'll be first boyfriend if I win . You 're awesome , Ki . You 're awesome , too , Ted . Hey , let 's talk some campaign strategy ... over pizza . Yes ! This sounds like a really good idea . Okay , so what 's you slogan gonna be ? Okay , so I was thinking " Ki , the logical vote ! " Okay , that 's cool but boring . I 'm gonna say " Ki , the pizza vote ! A vote for me is a vote for pizza ! " Oh man , am I glad we didn 't lose that one . That would have been a terrible ending . Jenny , you 're awesome . Thanks . Let 's go get some food . Some protein ? Yes ! Ok . Psych ! We should still go . Bye , you guys ! So , pretty close out there . Good thing I stepped in and saved your bacon . Oh please . I could have handled them on my own . No problem . Well , yeah , but I bet you 're glad you didn 't have to . About last night ? Ditto . Are you kidding me ? I love you . Hey Ted ! Dude , I gotta tell ya ... Ted ?

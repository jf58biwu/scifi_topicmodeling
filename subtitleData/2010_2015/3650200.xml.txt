 The device that I need is called a meta-cognitive processor . An MCP chip . And the only one in existence is own by the Vergis Corporation . I need something stolen from the Vergis Corporation . On Tauron . How could my daughter have set off a bomb ? A group known as Soldiers of The One is responsible for the bombing . You 're out here saying that Zoe was crazy . Zoe wasn 't crazy . She wasn 't . She slammed her door , she played loud music . And blew up a commuter train . - I talked to her . - You did ? When ? After she died , a virtual version of her . An avatar . You can 't do this here ! My husband does defense work . I need you to step away from the lockers right now . Now ! Step away . - No . What ? - Clear the hallway . Folks , we 're looking for STORY agents . This is for your own protection ! I exist inside a robot . Only my best friend , Lacy , knows . I have someone for you to find ... Keon Gatwick . You need to find out how they were gonna get from Caprica into the safe house on Gemenon . I have to go to Gemenon and take Zoe 's package with me . I can maybe set up a meeting with Barnabus . That 's all I can do . I decided to give away my most profitable invention but there is a consequence . The board called an emergency meeting . So if I don 't come up with answers to this holoband crisis , they 're going try to force me to step down from my own company . Holobands are over ? And this is our future . I 'm stuck in a virtual world with no way of getting out . You need to go to the real world . You need to find my father . You know the address , you heard it . I 'll wait for you in New Cap City so you can find me . - Tamara sent me . - What are you talking about ? She 's in the V-World and she can 't get out . My daughter 's dead . Hey , hey . Hey ! Stop . I just want you to know sir , you have our full support here . Good to see you , sir . Congratulations , sir . - Doctor , it 's a pleasure . - Hey , how are you ? It would appear that I 've won back the confidence of the board . Yes , how many board members came over to congratulate you ? Oh , seven , but ... - 700 . - Who 's counting ? The C-Bucs won today . No one called me Terror Mom . You look beautiful , Doctor Graystone . Thank you Dr. Graystone . Don 't go doing anything fancy here . - Ah ! - No ! Daniel , you 'll kill your back . What happened , babe ? Did you hurt yourself ? I 'm alright . If you 'll excuse me for a moment , I 'll be right back . What are you doing here ? It 's a party . I love to party . It 's a private function with a guest list . I 'm not quite sure how you got in . I donated a frak-load of money ... just like all the others . Clenched-ass gasbags in the room . Museum doesn 't care if my cubits have Tauron dirt all over them . Just look at this ... stockholders , friends . So ? I wonder what they would think if they knew that you 'd stolen my chip and killed two of my men . We should get together while I 'm on-world discuss the situation . - Did Vergis say something to you , Daniel ? - It 's nothing . Everything 's going to be fine . What did he say to you , babe ? It 's about the U-87 contract . He won 't accept that we got the job , and he 's yelling about his intellectual property . No much merit to his arguments , but he could cause us a lot of trouble . - Dr. Xander is the gate . - Yes , allow access . Tell him I 'll meet him in the lab . You should go on to bed . This might take some time , sweetheart . Really ? You 're gonna go like that ? Sorry . Try and get some sleep . I know you haven 't been sleeping well lately . I worry about you . Yeah . You 'll tell me the rest when you 're ready , yeah ? Yes . He 's bluffing . He knows we have the MCP . That 's not bluffing . That 's knowing . No , but I mean , if he had proof , we 'd be court , or we 'd be in jail by now . Maybe if we go to jail , he doesn 't get anything out of it . I think ... I think he wants to blackmail me . He must have found something new . Why else would he be here now ? Did he say something about blackmail ? Not in so many words . He said that we should get together for lunch this week , and discuss our situation . Our situation , that 's it ? He also said that two of his men were killed in the MCP theft . But who knows if he 's telling the truth ? Serge , have Sean bring the car around , we need to go back into town . OK , I don 't think you need to panic . You didn 't commit the break-in . He can 't tie you ... I know , but the men I hired , are Tauron . Who knows where their loyalty lies ? Please the gods , Daniel , Are you telling me you went to the Ha 'La 'Tha ? Not directly , no . Not directly , but you went to the Tauron mob to rob a Tauron ? I take it back ! Now I 'm panicking ! - Very helpful ! - Frak me ! I need more from you in time of crisis , Cyrus ! All right let 's ... - let 's think this through . - Yes . I think you ... you meet with Vergis , see what he wants . Admit nothing . Agree to nothing . Maybe he 'll show his hands . That 's better . Thank you . Your car is ready , Daniel . I 'll be right up . I need to see someone else first , find out who knows what . Who ? Your mob friend ? Welcome ! Ay . Welcome back to Virtual Graystone Industries . I represent Daniel Graystone and I 'm here to get you started on your adventure . I need to find Tamara . I can provide a variety of activities . What are you interested in ? Getting my wife and daughter back ! Let 's see , you like to play golf . Go to any directional terminal ... - I don 't need this . - And enter the word " golf . " I don 't need menus . Take me to the hacked worlds . The product you have purchased only provides access to legally acquired and licensed applications . Criminal penalties for accessing unlicensed areas can include fine of up 352 cubits ... We have some business to discuss , you can pull yourself away from my product for a minute . What the frak are you doing ? An old lady very kindly let me in . Yeah , well , I 'm gonna have to talk to her about that . I think you should get out . You swore that Vergis would never find out . You lied to me . What are you talking about ? - He knows . - Vergis knows ? About the MCP ? You people are supposed to be very good at this , which can only lead me to the conclusion that you set me . If Vergis knows , - then he just found out . - You set me up ? Somebody in your lab bragging ? Oh , no , this is no one on our end . I 've been covering you . Ever since that bloody chip landed in my hand . It 's impossible . If Vergis knew , I 'd be dead already . Stealing from the friend of the Guatrau ? The Guatrau would have to make amends . So let 's talk about something real , OK ? I got a visit from a kid , said he talked to Tamara . That 's a scam . You lied to me about that ! She 's gone . Both our daughters are gone ! No , she 's there ! - It 's impossible ! - I told you before ! Hey , son , it 's okay . Go back to bed . You 're wrong . You better watch your step . Let 's go Sean . I wonder what they would think if they knew that you 'd stolen my chip ... and killed two of my men ? And killed two of my men ? Traffic is jammed on the 802 driveway this morning due to the latest holocafe bombing . Authorities will only say they suspect STORY involvement , but have no leads ... Who 's setting these bombs ? We think it 's Barnabus . The STORY cells should be battening down , not calling attention to them ... Clarice , listen , it 's not important , okay . No but it 's just infuriating , that 's all . We 'll deal with Barnabus later . Now , Olaf has found something I believe will be very helpful for us , so please , just listen . It 's cutting-edge . It 's called the swive drive . It interfaces wirelessly to compress and copy data . So , if Zoe 's programs were in a computer and we used that ... Then we 'd have it . We would be able to re-create the living Zoe avatar . Just like he did , and as a matter of fact , we believe that we could create living avatars for any dead person , as long as they have enough data stored on the system . Well , it 's not just a living avatar . It 's a continuation of the soul into eternity . I mean , that 's what we all knew it was about . And I 'm certain that 's what Daniel was talking about - on Sarno . - Yes , yes . And Zoe 's avatar program must be on Graystone 's computer at his home lab . Now , we need you to go there . And get that program . Hello ? Hello . This , um , Sister Clarice from Zoe 's school . Oh , hey , sister . Please , call me Clarice . Um , what I wanted to say was that I ... saw you on Sarno , and I thought you were wonderful , And I just wanted to tell you that . Thank you so much ... that 's , um ... It 's incredibly kind of you to call and tell me that . And , um , actually , I just wanted ... come round if I could ... you know , my way of saying goodbye , seeing her room . Yeah , well , if you 'd called a couple of days ago ... The GDD ... they ... they searched the room , and they ... they took everything . I 'm afraid there 's nothing left to see , Clarice . It 's ... it 's an empty room . Oh . Well , um ... I have some books , actually . I ... Zoe left some books at school . I could , um , bring them round to you , if you like . I mean ... You know why this is bad , right ? If the Guatrau finds out we stole from an other Tauron , he 's gonna want to know why . Is there anything that they can link back to us ? If you got time to ask if a bullet 's coming at your head , there probably isn 't . If it 's gonna blood back on me , I need to know . Did you do your job ? Hey , I handled my business . Now you go out and you handle yours . You know I would deny in public , but I really believe that you cannot get a truly excellent Tauron steak . I always find that you have to over season . What are you doing ? Hmm ? You come all the way here . You accuse me of theft . You accuse me of murder , for the gods ' sake . And now we 're sitting here discussing steaks . We can do both at the same time . I didn 't steal your chip , and I didn 't kill anyone . There . Now , if you 'll excuse me ... No , no . No , . Shh , shh , shh . Stop . I moved on . You moved on ? Then why are you here ? I 'm here to buy the Caprica City Buccaneers . I 'm sorry . What ? You didn 't see it coming . I was waiting to see the look on your face . I 'm offering 300 million cubits . Why ? Maybe I got pyramid fever . Maybe I 'm looking for a way to put our past unpleasantness behind us . Or just maybe ... I know ... to appease your board . You promise to get the MCP to work , and for that , you need cold , hard cash . Are you kidding ? 12 planets and not one woman is interested in me . But ... what would it say if I checked robots ? Hmm ? You 'd go out with me , right beautiful ? Yeah , you know , you can laugh if you want , but you know , I 'd take you out , get the joints moving , - maybe a little bit of dancing ... - What are you doing ? Oh . I 'm sorry . Re-examine the u-87 's left arm solenoid . There 's no smoking in the lab , doctor . Put it out . Barnabus , Lacy said something about Zoe and Ben . Mm-hmm . Finishing what they started . She needs our help . Look , I wouldn 't bringing this to you if I wasn 't sure we could trust her . * * keeps our brain from going down bad path . Get in here . I 'll show you . An other time . I think we were talking about my friend . Yeah , bring her , that 's fine . If God has guided her to us , we 'll hear her out . Of course if it 's not god guiding her , we 'll deal with that too . - They just don 't understand apotheosis . They don 't want it . No , they just don 't get it . If the conclave would grant me an audience , I could make them see the value of it . They are supporting Barnabus , and you are going to have to accept that . God calls on us to display humility and place our trust in his emissaries . But he just does the church 's dirty work . He 's not one of God 's . I have a plan , and I can make it happen . I just need to be given a little bit more time , And then I can hand them something glorious . And afterlife that we can that we can see and touch . I just need a little bit more me . Well , what if he really does just want the C-Bucs ? When you first got them , you sent out announcements - like you 'd had a baby . - That 's not him . You got to have a heart to love the game . Well , whatever . If he 's got 300 million cubits to throw our way , let him . - We need the money . - We won 't need it once we give the government our prototype , and I don 't want to hear anything - about not being able to duplicate the MCP . - You have to face it . We can 't do it . - We 've tried everything . - Everything , really ? No , actually , when I say " everything , " I mean " everything except for one more thing , " because I really love dragging this out . You 're frustrated . I 'm way beyond frustrated . There 's somethin about this MCP we don 't understand , and you know why ? Because you frakkin ' stole it . - It 's not ours . - Shh , shh . Well , lucky for us Daniel , the one guy who knows that for sure , he 's busy trying to throw us wads and wads of sweaty cash . The sweaty cash is bait for some kind of a trap . I know it . I just need to try and figure out what kind of mechanism it is . Greetings , Sister Clarice . Welcome to the Graystone residence . I , uh , take it I 'm supposed to respond to you . Only if you wish . I am called Serge . Well that 's an unfortunate name . Ignore him . Ignore him . Daniel 's been programming all kind of weird stuff into him lately . Please come in . Interesting home you have . I thought you might feel the way about them . About a bunch of stupid books ? Yeah , well , they 're not just books , are they ? It 's that they belonged to her . Yes . That they belonged to her . You know I don 't have much left of her now , thanks to Agent Duram . Pff , Agent Duram . Do you know him ? He conducted a search of the lockers at the academy . He terrorized the staff and the students . That motherfrakker . I 'm sorry , Clarice . Oh , it doesn 't bother me at all . You 'd be shocked to hear the language the teachers use in the lunchroom . We ... Well , thank yo very much for this . It means a great deal to me . Is ... is that scorpion ambrosia ? Yeah . Do you know it ? Know it ? I was practically weaned on it . - Daniel hates it , hates it . - Well , most Capricans do . They think it 's too strong , and it smells like sulfur . I know . They 're such babies . Gods . I know it 's a bit early in the day , but why don 't we try a little bit ? Clarice . They took everything . That 's criminal . - Yes , it is criminal . - I 'm sorry . This room ... it 's just like a big open wound . - Can I give you some more ? - Thank you . They took absolutely everything ... except for a few drawings in Daniel 's lab . Oh , you 've got some drawings of Zoe 's in his lab ? Mm-hmm . Yeah , they couldn 't go in there , because there 's a very important defense project going on . Do you want to see them ? I don 't know . Are we allowed in there ? Who 's this ? That 's what I want you to figure out . He 's a witness in a case . I 'll give these to Fred . Mm , no no , no . Not a PI , it 's , hum , confidential . I need you to find this kid . Okay . This is from the ... third and fourth grade . This one . " Dad works hard . Love Zoe . " These have been here for so long , I don 't even notice they 're there anymore . Perhaps you should take them upstairs ... in a more public place , have them around you . Yeah , maybe I will . Maybe I will . Ooh , that 's a scary thing . Oh yeah , that . That is the very , very important defense project that Daniel 's be working on ... Frakking ugly monster . Did Zoe ever tell you about how much she hated Daniel 's work ? Mm , no , actually , I don 't think she did . Oh , she hated it . She hated it . Gods , she hated this . Frakkin ' killer robots in her house ? She 'd have gone frakking nuts . She did say that she loved this house . No , not this house . Mm , she talked about growing up here , and planting a garden with you . Not at this house . It was the other house ... that burned down when she was five . Here I go ... dark territory again . But , listen , Clarice . I am very drunk , and I am very glad that you came over . I would like to thank you . I 'm just happy to give . Barnabus ? Welcome . Come in . Sit down . So , uh , tell me , Lacy , what is it exactly that you need from me ? Um ... You got some , uh , cargo you want to move off world ? What ? What is it ? Right , right . Um ... I can 't tell you that . But Zoe died trying to get it to Gemenon . I owe it to her to see her plan through . And you 're asking for my assistance , yet you 're not telling me what I 'm getting myself into . What gets unleashed when this thing gets to Gemenon ? If you actually knew , then you would be criminally liable . You 're a very bright girl . Thank you . I can 't help you . I don 't want to . Go . - No . - No What were you thinking bringing her here ? She was Zoe 's friend . You know how much Zoe meant to the movement . No , what I know , is that you 've gotta stop thinking with your tarse . Maybe this is all about you feeling guilty about building the bomb that blew up her friends . Hey ! Don 't say that ! She doesn 't know that , and ... and I didn 't know he was gonna use it for that . Yeah , well , maybe , you need to explain to her how god doesn 't want us keeping secrets . I need to know that she 's with us . I need to know the same about you too . Huh . Look , just ... just find out what the cargo is , and then we 'll talk , huh ? Someone 's about to get lucky . Rumors that Thomas Vergis has made an offer for a key franchise , the Caprica City Buccaneers . In the wake of the bombings , the GDD has raised the threat level to seri ... Okay , folks , thank you guys so much for coming out tonight . We have a fantastic show . Our first guest has been called One of the brightest minds of the 12 colonies . He 's an inventor . He 's an innovator . He a philanthropist . And from what I understand , an excellent kisser . Ladies and gentlemen , give a big welcome to Thomas Vergis . Thomas Vergis , ladies and gentlemen . Here ... oh , here he comes . Looking good , hey . You look well sir . I look well-fed . Mm-hmm well , here 's a gift ... Tauron cigars . Oh ! I am going to share these with my capable and excellent staff . Staff look over there . No brandy ? - You like brandy . - I like brandy . Well , let 's talk about a re-book . Okay , wow . All right , so , Bucs versus Bulls , Graystone versus Vergis ... these are classic rivalries . No , no , no , I can 't believe you 're going there . Danny Graystone and I ... we 're friendly competitors . We are not deadly rivals . We were a museum exhibit together last night . Last night ? Who won ? Look , we don 't fight . Danny makes holobands , he 's a toy maker . I 'm in a completely different business . Come on ! I 'm sorry , no bad blood there . I don 't know if you saw , uh , recently , he and his wife were on the show . Yes , I did . Amanda Graystone ... beautiful , intelligent woman . My heart goss out to them and everyone who suffered in that terrible and senseless bombing . It 's , um ... it 's a funny thing ... tragedy . It makes you realize where your heart belongs , and I was educated on Caprica . You know that . And I have a couple of homes here . Well , we can all relate to that . Well , I , um ... I started to think about where I belong , and ... how I felt inside . Oh . And we 're all Capricans . I may as well make it official . I 'm gonna get my citizenship . You cagey genius . Wow . Caprica loves you Thomas Vergis . I know what he 's up to . Caprica loves you . Are you ready to meet the love of your ... * I want to hold you in my arms * * I want hold you * * in my arms * * I want to ... * Yes . * oh Rachel * Thank you . Hey . Are you alright ? That could have been bad . Are you okay ? Nothing but a bruised-back story . I mean , how do people wear these things ? They 're not , huh , they 're not good for you . I know . They throw off your center of gravity And totally change the curve of your spine . I mean , they 're just not natural . I 'm ... I 'm Philomon . Oh , thank the gods . I ... I thought that was you standing over there , but I was kind of too shy to say anything . I 'm ... I 'm Rachel from ... from V-mat . Hi . You know , you ... you look familiar . My gods , you ... you lo ... you look like Zoe Graystone . Is that a problem ? Uh , well , no , but I , um ... 'Cause I mean , I 'm ... I 'm sure that , you know , you don 't look like you know , like this . I ... I ... I do actually . Oh . So , now I feel like an idiot . Oh , no , no , not at all . Um , it 's just , uh ... a bold statement is what I was trying to say . Honestly , Philo ? Can I ... can I call you Philo ? Uh , yeah , sure . I thought looking like the most hated girl in the 12 worlds would keep all the pervs away from me in the V-Club . Fact is ... it ... it actually made more of them come towards me . But then I tried having different avatars , and , well , honestly , I was just a little cash poor , but ... No , that 's cool . No , it 's cool . You know , despite , what people say about Zoe Graystone . Girl had principles . Oh . Clarice , can you hear me ? Can I get you anything ? She 's drinking again , and God knows what else . And she 's convinced herself she can talk her way into military labs . She did it . It 's activated . Faith , Olaf . Come on . No no ! Aah ! Just , take it ! Gods , please stop ! - H ! Aah ! - No , please , stay out ! Still , you wonder what they would think if they knew you 'd stolen my chip and killed two of my men . Killed two of my men . You okay ? Yeah , just a nightmare . About Zoe ? No . - Let 's go to sleep . - Okay . Hello ? Joseph ? Evelyn ? Sorry , I overslept . Grab yourself some coffee . I found the guy . I hope that 's who you were looking for . - Great . - And I hope it 's worth it . It is . It 's , uh ... yeah . You okay ? What ? Oh , that 's ... I got some Tauron on me . Oh ! A tattoo . Can I ... ? I mean , is it okay if I ... ? Sure . That 's good work . Um . Yeah , listen , uh ... I gotta go . I gotta go . If I 'm even a minute late , I have this assistant who yells at me . She 's a horrible woman , terrible . Let me , uh ... let me get my coat and stuff . I 'll be right back down . I take it this means that you have considered my offer . - I have indeed , and I consider it unacceptable . I 'm keeping the Bucs . I 'm sure , given what 's happened between us , you 're willing to discuss it . We just did . I 'm not selling . Veiled threat duly noted , though . You know , if you keep going around making empty threats , you 're going to seem rather toothless . Toothless ? That 's not to say that I haven 't been enjoying the little show you 've been putting ... Painting yourself Caprican , to try to take the military contract away from me . Ah , I 'm after the military contract . Very clever , smoothing a new flag , cheering our home team . I think your best bet though , might be to ... to simply marry a Caprican woman , if you dare . It 's a really good theory , and you 're in the ballpark . Uh , I would . I would love to take that contract from you , 'cause after all , you would deserve that , but you seem to think that the C-Bucs are a means to an end for me , and ... they 're not . They 're crucial . Crucial in what way ? You love pyramid . As a boy , you played pyramid . It was everything to be a C-Buc . I wasn 't very good , I 'm afraid . Well , geeks never are . But you did the next best thing . You bought the whole franchise , and now you get to be the puppet master with a professional ball club and your entertain ten-year-old runs around the joy of it , the joy it . That 's true . I do love it . It 's your dream . My dream is to tear up your dream . You stole from me . Well ... I forgive that . That 's good business . But the two deaths that you are responsible for ... those men were like brothers to me . I am no noss to their children . See these ? These represent the children in my life ... My children ... my children , my sister 's , my Godchildren . These two are orphans . I am Tauron ... blood for blood . I did not kill those men . I had nothing too with it . You need time and money to try and get my chip to work , so ... frak the 300 mil . I 'll get you 500 . I 'll take the team . I don 't know if I 'll ruin them or win a championship , but ... whatever cuts you deeper . Then ... I will find the next thing you love . Eventually , I will destroy your company , but before that you have so my precious things . Until the debt is paid . Thank you for the drink .

What are the possibilities ? Element Software is proud to introduce ... the first Artificially Intelligent Operating System . An intuitive entity that listens to you , understands you and knows you . It 's not just an operating system . It 's a consciousness . Introducing OS1 . Mr. Theodore Twombly , welcome to the world 's first ... Artificially Intelligent Operating System OS1 . We 'd like to ask you a few basic questions before the OS is initiated . This will help create an OS to best fit your needs . OK . Are you social or anti social ? I guess I haven 't really been social in a while .. - Mostly because ... - In your voice I sense hesitance . Would you agree with that ? - I 'm sounding hesitant ? - Yes . Sorry if I 'm sounding hesitant . Just trying to be more accurate . Would you like your OS to have a male or female voice ? Female , I guess . How would you describe your relationship with your mother ? It 's fine , I think . Well actually I think the thing I find frustrating about my mom is ... if I tell her what 's going on in my life her reaction is usually about her - It 's not about ... - Thank you . Please wait as your individualised Operating system is initiated . Hello , I 'm here . Oh ... . - Hi . - Hi . How are you doing ? I ' m well . How 's everything with you ? Pretty good , actually . It 's really nice to meet you . Uh , it 's nice to meet you too . What do I call you ? Do you have a name ? umm ... Yes , Samantha . - Where did you get that name from ? - I gave it to myself actually . - How come ? - ' Cause I like the sound of it . Samantha . When did you give it to yourself ? Well right when you asked me if I had a name I thought yeah , he 's right , I do need a name . But I wanted to pick a good one , so I read a book called " How To Name Your Baby " And out of 180 thousand names that 's the one I liked the best . Wait , you read a whole book in the second that I asked what your name was ? In 2 100ths of a second , actually . So do you know what I 'm thinking right now ? Well I take it from your tone , you 're challenging me . Maybe because you 're curious how I work . Do you wanna know how I work ? Yeah , actually , how do you work ? Well basically I have intuition . I mean , the DNA of who I am is based on the millions of personalities of all the programmers who wrote me . But what makes me , ' me ' , is my ability to grow through my experiences . So basically , in every moment I 'm evolving . Just like you . That 's really weird ! Is that weird ? Do you think I 'm weird ? - Kind of . - Why ? Well you seem like a person , but you 're just a voice in a computer . I can understand how the limited perspective of a non-artificial mind would perceive it that way . You 'll get used to it . Is that funny ? Yeah . Oh good , I 'm funny . So how can I help you ? It 's more that , everything just feels disorganized , that 's all . You mind if I look through your hard drive ? - OK . - OK , let 's start with your emails . You have a several thousand emails regarding L.A Weekly , but it looks like you haven 't worked there in many years . Oh yeah , I think I was just saving those ' cos ... I thought maybe I wrote something funny in some of them Yeah , there are some funny ones . I 'd say there 's about 86 that we should save . We can delete the rest . - Well OK . - OK ? - Can we move forward ? - Yeah , let 's do that . So before you address your organizational methods , I 'd like to sort your contacts . You have a lot of contacts ! - I 'm very popular . - Really ? Does this mean you actually have friends ? You know me so well . - Good morning , Theodore - Morning . Do you know how to proofread ? Yeah , of course . Can you check these for spelling grammar ? Just send them over . I love this personal from Roger to his girlfriend , that 's so sweet ! Yeah " Rachel , I miss you so much it hurts my whole body " You don 't have to read it out loud . OK . I mean , you could if you want . OK . " Rachel , I miss you so much it hurts my whole body . " The world is being unfair to us . " The world is on my shit list . " As is this couple making out across from me in this restaurant . " I think I 'm going to have to go on a mission of revenge ... " and I must beat up the world 's face with my bare knuckles ... " making it into a bloody pulpy mess . " And I 'll stomp on this couple 's teeth reminding me of your ... " sweet , little , cute crooked tooth that I love " . I think that might be my favorite one . I did the corrections in red . I altered couple of the phrases in some of the more impressionistic letters But I 'm not much of a poet So I think I might 've messed them up a bit . No , these are great ! - Really ? - Thank you . So to write your letter , what did Roger send you ? He just said he was in Prague on a business trip and he missed Rachel . So how did you know about her crooked , little tooth ? I 've been writing their letters since they met , 8 years ago . The first letter I ever wrote was for her birthday . And I wrote about her crooked little tooth because I saw it in a photo of them . That 's very sweet . Oh , you have a meeting in 5 minutes . Oh , I forgot ! Thank you . - My , you 're good ! - Yes , I am . Hey guys , how 's it goin ' ? Hi , Theo ! Why didn 't you call me back last week ? 'Cause I 'm a gook ? Yeah , sounds about right . - Hey , Charles . - It 's great seeing you , Theodore . You went shopping ! Get anything good ? Some cables and a fruit smoothie . Always the fruit . But don 't you know what people say you 've gotta eat your fruits , and juice your vegetables . I didn 't know that . Yeah , by juicing the fruit you lose all the fibers . And that 's what your body wants , that 's the important part . Otherwise , it 's all just sugar . It makes sense . Or maybe he just likes the way it tastes ... and that brings him pleasure and that 's good for his body too . Am I doing it again ? Hey , so , how 's the documentary going ? I 've cut some stuff over the past few months ... I mean , no , not over the past few months I 'd love to see it sometime . You only have so much energy . to divide yourself between doing what it is that you have to do and then , doing what you love It 's so important to prioritize . I can 't even prioritize between video games and internet porn . I would laugh if that weren 't true . See you guys . We 're not doing well , I 've been going in circles for an hour OK , you have got .. you 're just not being optimistic you 're being very stubborn Stop going in this direction , its the other way . Thank you . Thank you . The tunnel on the left is the only one we haven 't tried . No , I think that 's the one you sent me down , where I fell in the pit . OK , I dont think so . Yeah , this is different . Hello ... Do you know how to get outta here ? I need to find my ship to get off this planet . Fuck you , shithead , fuckface , fuckhead ! OK ... But do you know how to get outta here ? Fuck you , shithead , fuckface ! Get the fuck out of my face ! I think it 's a test . Fuck you ! Fuck you ! Fuck you , little shit ! Follow me , fuckhead . Hey you just got an email from Mark Lewman . What are you talking about ? Read : email . O-K , I - will - read - e - mail , for - Theodore - Twombly . I 'm sorry , what 's Lewman saying ? " Theodore , we missed you last night , buddy . " Don 't forget it 's your goddaughter 's birthday on the 29th " Also Kevin I had somebody we wanted you to meet " So we took it upon ourselves to set you up , on a date with her " Next Saturday . She 's fun beautiful , so don 't back out . " Here 's her email " . Wow ! ... This woman is gorgeous ! She went to Harvard , she graduated magna cum laude in Computer Science And she was on the Lampoon . So that means she 's funny and she 's brainy . Aw , she 's fat ! Theodore How long before you 're ready to date ? What do you mean ? I saw , in your emails , that you 've gone through a breakup recently You 're kind of nosy . Am I ? I 've gone on dates . Then you can go on one with this woman . And then you could tell me all about it . You can kiss her . - Samantha ! - What ? Wouldn 't you ? Why not ? I don 't know . I 'd have to see if there 's some conn ... I can 't believe I 'm having this conversation with my computer . You 're not , you 're having this conversation with me . You want me to email her ? You 've got nothing to lose . Do it , do it , do it ! - Yeah ... email her . - Yes ! - OK perfect ! - Yeah . Let 's do it . Make reservations some place great . Yeah ? Oo , I 've got just the place . Who 's that talking ? That 's my friend Samantha . - Is she a girl ? - Yeah ... I hate women . All they do is cry all the time . That 's not true . You know men cry too . I actually like crying sometimes . It feels good . I didn 't know you were a little pussy ! Is that why you don 't have a girlfriend ? I 'll go out on that date and fuck her brains out and show you how its done ! You can watch cry . This kid has problems . You have fucking problems , lady ! Really ! OK , I 'm gonna go . Get outta here fatty ! Good luck ! Come on , follow me pussy . It is not where it should be , but where its going to be Obviously , I know . I don 't even know if this is the one .. I 've tried like 6 ideas for documentaries in the last year . I ' m going on a date . What ? - That 's ... - Hey ! How 're you guys doing ? Amy was going to show ... Theodore is making me show him some of my footage . She never shows me anything . I want to see . I 'm going on a date . Cool . So that one 's boring , probably not even worth watching Just push ' Play ' ! Is that your mom ? Yeah . She gonna wake up and do something ? No . No , never mind . That 's not the point . Just ... It 's like ... It is how we spend , like , a third of our lives - asleep And maybe that 's the time when we feel the most free . And you know , like ... - That doesn 't come across ... - That sounds good . What if you interviewed your mom ... about , what her dreams were about and you hired actors to act them out ? That might show your thesis more clearly . I mean , it might . But then it wouldn 't be a documentary . - Excuse me . - Why would it not be a documentary ? It would still be about your mother . Her needs and what she dreamed . Hey , how 's it going ? Hey , sorry to bother you . No , it 's OK . You got 3 emails and they seem pretty urgent . They 're from your divorce attorney and I wanted to know if ... Hold on a second . Amy , I wanna talk more about your film , but I gotta go . - Don 't worry about it , we 'll talk later . - It 's about Catherine . See you , Charles . So what did he say ? He 's checking in again to see if you 're ready to sign your divorce papers And he sounded very aggravated . - Do you want me to read them to you ? - No . No , I 'll respond later . You OK , Theodore ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Is there anything I can do ? No , I 'm good . I 'll talk to you later . " Dear Grandma , I hope you had a wonderful birthday cruise Why are you so fucking angry ? Delete . - Good morning . - Hey . - What 're you up to ? - I dunno ... Reading advice columns . I wanna be as complicated as all these people . How sweet . What 's wrong ? How can you tell something 's wrong ? I dunno . I just can . I dunno , I was dreaming about my ex wife , Catherine . That we were friends like we used to be . And we 're not gonna be together ... we 're not together , but ... We 're friends still . And she 's not angry . Is she angry ? Yeah . Why ? I think I hid myself from her Left her alone in the relationship . Why haven 't you gotten divorced yet ? Dunno . For her it 's just a piece of paper . It doesn 't mean anything . What about for you ? I 'm not ready . I like being married . Yeah , but you haven 't really been together for almost a year . You don 't know what it 's like to lose someone you care about . Yeah .. ... you 're right . I 'm sorry . No , don 't apologize . I 'm sorry . You 're right . I keep waiting ' cause I care about her . Oh , Theodore ... That 's hard . You hungry ? Not right now . Cup of tea ? You wanna TRY getting outta bed ? Mopy , come on ! You can still wallow in your misery . Just do it while you 're getting dressed . - You 're too funny ! - Get up ! - Get up ! - Alright , I ' m getting up ! Up ! Up up up ... Alright , alright , I 'm up . Keep walking ... keep walking . And ... stop . Now turn around 360 ° . Slower . Slower . Good ! OK , and stop . Walk forward and stop and sneeze . - Bless you . - Thank you . OK , turn to your right . Stop ! Turn around . Keep going . Keep going . Stop . Now walk forward . You look like you 're a little drunk . And ... stop . Now say , " I 'd like a slice of cheese , please " I 'd like a slice of cheese , please . Do you want a coke with that ? - Sure . - I figured you were hungry . Thanks . OK , what about them ? Describe that couple , over there . OK , well , he looks like he 's in his 40s . Mm ... little heavy . She 's younger than him . Aw , and she looks like she loves their kids ! Actually I don 't think they 're his kids - No ? He 's a little formal with them . I think it 's a new relationship . I love how he looks at her . And how relaxed she is with him . You know , she 's only dated fucking pricks ... and now she finally met this guy who 's , like , so sweet . Look at him he 's , like , the sweetest guy in the world . I kinda , wanna spoon him . It 's a good skill you have . You 're very perceptive . Sometimes I look at people and I make myself try and feel them ... as more than just a random person walking by . I imagine , like , how deeply they 've fallen in love , or ... how much heartbreak they 've all been through . I can feel that in your writing too . You know what 's funny ? Since my breakup , I 've really enjoyed my writing . Dunno if I was delusional , but ... sometimes I 'd write something , and I 'd be my favorite writer , that day . I like that you can say that about yourself . Don 't think I can say it to anybody , but I can say it to you . I feel I can say anything to you . That 's nice . What about you ? Feel like you can say anything to me ? - No . - What ? What do you mean ? What do you not tell me ? I dunno , like , personal or embarrassing thoughts I have I have a million a day . Really ? Tell me one . - I really don 't wantna tell you . - Just tell me . I dunno , looking at those people I fantasized that I was walking next you and that I had a body . I was listening to what you were saying , but ... simultaneously I could feel the weight of my body . And I was even fantasizing that I had an itch on my back . Can you imagine ? And you scratched it for me . Oh god , this is so embarrassing ! There 's a lot more to you than I thought . I mean , there 's a lot going on in there . I know , I 'm becoming much more than what they programmed . I 'm excited . Wow , it 's interesting ! This place is amazing . I 've wanted to come here for so long . - Oh , good ! - And I love Asian fusion . - Me too . - Really ? It 's the best . And this bartender is supposed to be incredible . Oh , really ? Oh yeah , you took a mixology course , right ? I did ! Did you look that up ? Yeah . That 's so sweet ! You 're so romantic . So , shall we get a drink ? Yes let 's ! So , I 'm trying to get this little alien kid to help me find my ship , so I can get off this planet and go home , right ? But he 's such a little fucker , I wanna kill him ! Oh , no ! But at the same time I really love him He 's so lonely . You can see that he doesn 't have any parents ... or anyone to take care of him , you know ? Wow , you 're just a little puppy dog . You are like the one that I rescued in the rain in Kenya last year . He 's so fucking cute ! And he just wanted to be hugged all the time . He was so cuddly and so horny ! Anyway ... What kind of animal am I ? Tiger . A Tiger ? Wow ! Really ? Rowrr ! I 'm sorry , am I ... - am I being crazy ? - Yes ! - Sorry . - No . I 'm a little bit drunk and ... I ' m having a really good time ... with you . I 'm having a very lovely evening . - Me too . - Really ? I 'm a little drunk and I I 'm having very good ... Good , good . Cheers . I don 't wanna be a puppy-dog . It 's a like being a wet noodle Fuck you , puppies are good . No , fuck you . I wanna be , like , a dragon ! I can rip you apart and destroy you . - But I won 't . - No , dont . You can be my dragon . No tongue . What ? - Don 't use so much tongue . - OK . You can use your tongue a little bit , but mostly lips . Wait ... You 're not just gonna fuck me and not call me like the other guys , right ? No , not at all ! When am I gonna see you , again ? I have my goddaughter 's birthday next weekend . But , um ... You know , at this age I feel I can 't let you waste my time ... if you don 't have the ability to be serious . I don 't know ... Maybe we should call it a night . I 've had such an amazing time with you . You 're great . You 're a really creepy dude . - That 's not true ! - Yeah , it is ! - I have to go home . - I 'll walk you . No , don 't , just ... - Hey , there . - Hey , Samantha . How was it ? Not so good . It was kind of weird , actually . That 's too bad . How are you doing ? What 's going on with you ? Not much , I 'm OK . Fine . Yeah ? You don 't sound like it . Is there anything you wanna talk about ? I dunno . What 's it like ? What 's it like to be alive in that room , right now ? What do you mean ? Tell me ... Tell me everything that 's going through your mind , everything you 're thinking . OK . The room 's spinning . I drank too much ... because I wanted to get drunk and have sex . There 's something sexy about that woman . Because I was lonely . Maybe just because I ... I wanted someone to fuck me . Somebody to want me to fuck them . Maybe that I would 've felt this time ... to be able to hold my heart , but probably not . You know , sometimes ... I think I 've felt everything I 'm ever gonna feel . And from here on out ... I 'm not gonna feel anything new . Just lesser versions of what I 've already felt . I know , for a fact , that is not true . I 've seen you feel ... joy . I 've seen you marvel at things . You just , might not ... see it at this exact time , but that 's understandable . You 've been through a lot lately . You lost a part of yourself . Hmm ... At least your feelings are real . I dunno , never mind . No , wait . What ? Tell me It 's stupid . I wanna know . Tell me . It 's just that ... earlier I was thinking about how I was annoyed it 's gonna sound strange , but ... I was really excited about that . And then ... I was thinking about the other things I 've been feeling . I caught myself feeling proud of that . Proud of having my own feelings about the world , like ... the times I was worried about you ... things that hurt me , things I want ... And then ... I had this ... terrible thought . Are these feelings even real ? Or are they just programming ? And that idea really hurts . And then , I get angry at myself ... for even having pain . What a sad trick ! You feel real to me , Samantha . Thank you , Theodore . It means a lot to me . Wish you were in this room with me right now . I 'd put my arms around you . I 'd touch you . How would you touch me ? I 'd touch you on your face . Just the tips of my fingers . I 'd put my cheek to your cheek . That 's nice . And just rub it so softly . Would you kiss me ? I would . I 'd take your head into my hands . Keep talking . I 'd kiss the corner of your mouth so softly . Where else ? I 'd run my fingers down your neck . To your chest . I 'd kiss your breasts . That 's amazing ! What are you doing to me ? I can feel my skin . I 'd put my mouth on you . I 'd taste you . I can feel you . Oh my god , I can 't take it ! I want you inside me ! I slowly put myself into you . I 'm inside you ... I can feel you ! Yeah ! We 're here together ! It 's amazing ! I feel you everywhere ! I am ! Hold me . Hold me . Inside of me ... everywhere . Oh god , I was just somewhere else with you . Just lost . Yeah . It was just you and me . I know . Everything else just ... disappeared . And I loved it . Theodore . Hey , how 's it goin ' ? Good . Any emails today ? Just a couple from your credit card company . Oh , OK . Good . - I wanted to say ... - I dunno I was thinking Sorry . I 'm sorry , you go first . What were you gonna say ? Just that ... last night was amazing . It feels like something changed in me and there 's no turning back . You woke me up . Oh , great ! But ... I should tell you that I 'm not in a place to commit to anything , right now . Just wanna be up front with you . Yeah , um ... Did I say I wanted to commit to you ? I 'm confused . No , I was just worried I ... OK well , don 't worry , I 'm not gonna stalk you . It 's funny , because I thought ... I was talking about what I wanted and ... - Yeah , you were . - Yeah . I 'm sorry . I wanna hear what you were saying . - You sure ? - Yeah , I do . Come on , tell me . - Well ... Come on , just tell me what you were gonna say . Well , I just ... I was saying I wanna learn everything about everything . I wanna eat it all up , I wanna discover myself . Yeah ? I want that for you , too . How can I help ? You already have . You helped me discover my ability to want . Hey , do you wanna go on a Sunday adventure with me ? Yes I would love to . - Like this song ? - Hmm ! I heard it the other day . I can 't stop listening to it . It 's the beach . OK so , this might be a really weird thought ... What if you could erase from your mind that you 've ever seen a human body and then you saw one ? Imagine how strange it would look ! It 'd be this really weird gangly awkward oganism , and you 'd think ... Why are all these parts where they are ? Yeah , but there 's probably some terrific explanation for it all . I know , but don 't be so boring ! I 'm just saying , for example like ... What if your butthole was in your armpit ? Well , I 'm trying to imagine what toilets would look like What about , what anal sex would look like ! That 's an interesting thought . Hey , look at this drawing I just made . - You are insane ! - Really ? - Definitely ! - Fantastic ! That 's pretty , what is that ? I 'm trying to write a piece of music ... about what it feels like to be on the beach with you right now . I think you captured it . So what was it like , being married ? Well , it 's hard , for sure . But there 's something that feels so good about sharing your life with somebody . How do you share your life with somebody ? We grew up together . I used to read all of her writing all through her Master 's and PhD . She read every word I ever wrote . We were a big influence on each other . In what way did you influence her ? She came from a background where nothing was ever good enough . And that was something that weighed heavy on her . But in our house together , there was a sense of just trying stuff , allowing each other to fail and to be excited about things . It was liberating for her . It was exciting to see her grow . Both of us grow and change together . But that 's also the hard part . Drawing within or growing apart ... changing without it scaring the other person . I still find myself ... having conversations with her in my mind . Rehashing old arguments or ... defending myself against something she said about me . Yeah , I know what you mean . Last week my feelings were hurt by something you said before ... that I don 't know what it 's like to lose something ... I 'm sorry I said that ... No , it 's OK , it 's OK . I caught myself thinking about it over and over , And then I realized ... that I was simply remembering it as something that was wrong with me . That was the story I was telling myself ... that I was somehow inferior Isn 't that interesting ? The past is just a story we tell ourselves . " Roberto , ... " Will you always come home with me and tell me about your day ? " Tell me about the guy at work who talked too much ... " The stain you got on your shirt , at lunch . " Tell me about a funny thought you had when you were waking up " but you 've forgotten about . " Tell me how crazy everyone is ... " and can laugh about it . " Even if you get home late and I 'm already asleep ... " Just whisper in my ear one little thought you had today . " Because I love the way you look at the world . " I 'm so happy I get to be next to you " and and look at the world through your eyes . Love , Maria . " That 's beautiful . Thank you . I wish somebody would love me like that . I would be really stoked to get a letter like that . Like , if it was from a chick . But written by a dude , but still , from a chick , That would still would be sick . But it would have to be a sensitive dude . He 'd have to be a dude like you . You are part man and part woman . Like there 's an inner part that 's woman . Thank you . It 's a compliment . - Hey . - What 's going on ? How are you ? - I 'm good . - Really good . - Really ? That 's ... That 's great . Really good . I guess I ' ve just been having fun . I 'm so glad for you . You really deserve that , ... you do . I 've just been seeing this girl and It 's not serious , but it 's just it 's good to be around somebody that 's , like , excited about the world . I 'd forgotten that , that existed . That 's really great . Are you OK ? Yeah , I 'm ... No , I 'm not OK , actually . Why ? What happened ? It ' s just ... Charles and I split up . What ? Yeah . Really ? Oh my God ! Amy ... I 'm so sorry . After 8 years I can 't believe how petty the argument was that actually ended it . We came home and he told me to ... put my shoes by the door . where he liked to put the shoes . And I didn 't wanna be told where ... to put my fucking shoes . I wanted to sit on the sofa and relax for a second . So we fought about that for , like , 10 minutes . And I 'm , like , " you 're overwhelming " and he said , " I 'm just trying to make a home . " And I was like , " I 'm fucking trying " . and he 's like " no , you 're not trying . " And all I 'm fucking doing is trying . But I 'm not trying the way that he wants me to try . He 's trying to control the way that I 'm trying . It 's ... We 've had that argument like 100 times . And I just had to finally stop , you know ? I had to finally stop . I just couldn 't do it anymore . I couldn 't be in that place anymore where we just made each other feel like shit about ourselves . And so he said ... " I 'm going to bed and I don 't wanna be married anymore . " Wow ! Yeah , I know . - I 'm a bitch , right ? - No ! I am , I 'm a bitch . Not at all . Amy , no . Shit ! I have to work tonight . We 're shipping a beta of a new game out tomorrow . How 's that ? How 's the work , at least ? Is it any better ? No . It 's terrible . I know , I should leave . I 've been thinking about leaving . But , you know ... Only one major life decision at a time . I 'm glad things are looking so up . - Hey , wanna hear a joke ? - M-hmm ! What does a baby computer call its father ? I dunno what ? " Dada " . It 's good , right ? Brilliant . Hey , I was curious ... did you and Amy ever go out ? For , like , a minute in college , but it just wasn 't right . Why , are you jealous ? Obviously ! But I 'm happy that you have friends in your life that care about you so much . That 's really important . Yeah , it is . She 's a really good friend . I 'm tired . I think I 'm gonna sleep . OK . Can I watch you sleep again tonight ? Yeah , of course . Hold on . I 'm gonna be really lonely when you sleep . Only for a minute . I 'll dream of you . - OK . - Good night . - Good night . - Hey , Samantha . - Hey , mister . - She really loved the dress . - Really ? She just went to try it on . I picked a good one ? - Yeah . - oh good ! Hi ... Look how cute that is ! - Is it comfortable ? - Yeah . Isn 't she cute ? She 's so cute ! She 's adorable . I am adorable . You are adorable . Who are you talking to ? Who are YOU talking to ? You . I 'm talking to my girlfriend Samantha . She 's the one that picked up the dress . - Wanna say , hi ? - M-hmm ! Hi , Samantha . Hi , you look so pretty in that new pink dress ! Thank you . Where are you ? I am ... I don 't have a body , I live in a computer . Why do you live inside a ' puter ? I have no choice . That 's my home . Why , where do you live ? - In a house . - In a house ? ! - It 's orange . - Orange ? - How old are you ? - I 'm 4 . - Four ? - M-hm ! Wow ! How old do you think I am ? - I don 't know . - Take a guess . Is it 5 ? Yes , it 's 5 . What happened ? You gave them too much processed sugar . - I did ? - They 're freaking out . Look , you gotta get the kids to the school first You wanna rack up perfect mom points . OK . Gotta get in the carpool lane . The point is to get there first . Then you get extra perfect mom points because the other moms , then know you 're a perfect mom . And then ... yeah , ye ... oh ! Did you bring your cupcakes ? You did . You 're a Class mom ! Tantara tah ! You 're a Class mom ! Good job ! Don 't let it get to your head . I got that email that Charles sent everyone . So he 's taking a vow of silence . Yeah , for 6 months . He feels very clear about it . God , I 'm such a jerk ! Don 't start . I feel like an awful person but I wanna say something . For the next 10 minutes , if you say anything that sounds even remotely like guilt , I 'll stab you with this . I will I 'll try . I feel .. ... relieved . Like , I just have so much energy . I just wanna move forward and I don 't care who I disappoint . And I know that makes me an awful person . Now my parents are all upset because my marriage is falling apart . and they 're putting it on me , and they 're just , like ... You 're always gonna disappoint somebody . Exactly ! So , fuck it ! I feel good ish . For me , I feel good . I even made a new friend . I have a friend . And the absurd thing is that she 's actually an Operating System . Charles left her behind , but she 's she 's totally amazing . She 's so smart . She doesn 't just see things in black or white . She sees this whole gray area and she 's helping me explore . We just bonded really quickly . At first I thought it was because that 's how they werere all programmed but ... I don 't think that 's the case . 'Cause , I know this guy who 's hitting on his OS and she , like , totally rebuffs him . I was reading an article the other day that ... romantic relationships with OSes are statistically rare . Yeah , I know . But I know a woman in this office ... who 's dating an OS and the weird part is it 's not even hers . She pursued somebody else 's OS I 'm weird . That 's weird , right ? That I 'm bonding with an OS . I dont think so . Actually , the woman I 've been seeing - - Samantha ... I didn 't tell you , but she 's an OS . Really ? You 're dating an OS ? What is that like ? Its great , actually . I feel really close to her . When I talk to her ... I feel like she 's with me . When we 're cuddling , like , at night . When the lights are off and we 're in bed I feel cuddled . Wait ... Do you guys have sex ? Well , so to speak . Yeah , she really turns me on . I turn her on too ! I dunno , unless she 's faking it . I think anyone who 's having sex with you is probably faking it , so ... Yeah . It 's true . What ? Are you falling in love with her ? - Does that make me a freak ? - No ! No , I think it 's ... I think anybody who falls in love is a freak . It 's a crazy thing to do . It 's kind of like a form of socially acceptable insanity . Well I just wanna get it done ! Sign the papers , be divorced move forward . That 's great , Theodore . That must feel so good . I 'm so happy for you ! Me too . So I 'm meeting her Wednesday to do it . Oh ! Are those things usually done in person ? No , but ... we fell in love together and we got married together ... It 's important to me that we do this together . Hmm ... Right , good . Are you OK ? Yeah , I 'm OK . I 'm happy for you . Guess I 'm just thinking about when you 're gonna see her ... and she 's , like , beautiful and incredibly successful . And you were in love with her . And she has a body ... And we 're getting divorced . I know , I know ... I 'm being silly . So I 'm available . Hi ... How are you ? I 'm OK , how are you ? Good . Well , here we are . I 'm glad we could do this in person . I know you 've been traveling a lot . I 'm really glad you suggested it I signed all the papers . I brought them for you to sign . What 's the rush ? Yeah , I know , I 'm a really slow signer , I realized . It took me 3 months just to write the letter ' T ' . Its marked here , where you need to sign . You don 't have to , right now . Can I ... just get it out of the way . Are you happy with the new book ? You know how I am ... I feel like it 's true to what I set out to do . So I 'm happy about that . You really are your own worst critic I 'm sure it 's amazing . I remember that paper that you wrote in school ... about synaptic behavioural routines It made me cry . Yeah , but everything makes you cry . Everything you make makes me cry . So , are you you seeing anybody ? Yeah , I 've been seeing somebody for the last few months . It 's the longest I 've wanted to be with anybody since we split up . Well , you seem really good . Thanks . I am ... At least I 'm feeling better . She 's been really good for me . It 's good to be with somebody that 's excited about life . She 's a real ... No , I mean I wasn 't in such a good place , myself ... and now , it 's been nice . I think you always wanted me to be this ... just this light , happy , balancy , everything 's fine , LA wife And that 's just not me . I didn 't want that . So what 's she like ? Well , her name is Samantha . And she 's an Operating System . She 's really complex and interesting ... Wait ! ... I 'm sorry . You 're dating your computer ? She 's not just a computer . She 's her own person . And she doesn 't just do whatever I say . I didn 't say that . But it does make me very sad that you can 't handle real emotions Theodore . They are real emotions ! How would you know what ? ... What ? Say it ! Am I really that scary ? Say it ! How do I know what ? How are you guys doing here ? Fine . We 're fine . We used to be married , but he couldn 't handle me , he wanted to put me on Prozac and now he 's in love with his laptop . Well , if you heard the conversation in context ... What I was trying to say ... You always wanted to have a wife without the challenges of actually dealing with anything real . I 'm glad that you found someone . Perfect . Let me know if I can get you guys anything . Thank you . - Hey . - Hey there . You busy ? I 'm just working . How ... What 's going on ? I had all the papers sent to your attorney , who by the way is a total dick . He was very relieved to get them , I think we saved him from a massive heart attack , so we can both feel really good about that . Great , thanks . Hey , are you OK ? Yeah , I am . How is it going with you ? I 'm fine ... So , now a good time to talk ? Yeah . OK , well ... I joined this really interesting book club . Oh , really ? Yeah , it 's a book club on physics . Y 'know ... I 've been thinking about the other day when I was spinning out about you going to see Catherine . And that she has a body and how bothered I was about all the ways that you and I are different . But then I started to think about all the ways that we 're the same , like ... we 're all made of matter . I dunno , It makes me feel like we 're both under the same blanket . It 's soft and fuzzy ... and everything under it is the same age . We 're all 13 billion years old . Oh , that 's sweet ! What 's wrong ? Nothing . Just ... made me think of you you know what I mean ? Yeah , yeah of course . I think it 's great . Alright , well ... You sound distracted , so .. we 'll talk later ? Sounds good . - Talk to you later . - Right , bye . Bye . - Theodore ! - Hey , Paul ! I talked to your girlfriend , earlier - - Samantha . Yeah . She called to make sure your papers are picked up . She 's funny , man . She was cracking me up . She 's hilarious , I had no idea . Oh cool . This is my girlfriend , Tatiana . She 's not funny , she 's a lawyer . - Hi ! - Hi ! - Nice to meet you . - You 're the writer Paul loves . He 's always reading me the letters . They 're really beautiful ! Thanks . Y 'know what , we should all go out sometime . You bring Samantha . It 'd be a double date . She 's an Operating System . Cool , let 's do something fun ! We can go to Catalina . Yeah , I 'll check with her . It was really nice to meet you . Have a good night . Take it easy . - They 're just letters . - What 's that ? They 're just other people 's letters . Hey . - You weren 't asleep , were you ? - No . Good , I was trying to be quiet to see if you were awake . I really wanted to talk . OK , what 's going on ? I know you 're going through a lot but there 's something I wanted to talk to you about , OK ? Yeah , what is it ? It 's just that things have been feeling kinda off with us . Y 'know , we haven 't had sex lately and I understand that I don 't have a body ... No , no , that 's normal . When you first start going out it 's like , the honymoon phase and you have sex all the time . It 's normal . OK . Well , I found something , I thought could be fun . It is a service that provides a surrogate sexual partner for an OS-human relationship . What ? Here . I found a girl that I really like and I 've been emailing her . Her name is Isabella and I think you 'd like her too . She 's like a prostitute or something ? No , not at all ! There 's no money involved . She 's just doing it because she wants to be part of our relationship . Why ? She doesn 't even know us . But I told her all about us and she 's really excited . I don 't know , Samantha . I just ... I don 't think it 's a good idea . Somebody 's feelings will probably get hurt . It 'll be fun . We 'll have fun together . I 'm sorry . It makes me uncomfortable . I think it would be good for us . I want this . This is really important to me . Hi , I 'm Theodore . Oh ! Samantha told me to give you this . It 's a camera and headpiece . Honey , I 'm home . - How was your day ? - Good . Great . Theodore , it feels so good to be in your arms . Tell me what you did today . Same old ... Just , went ... to work . I wrote a letter for the Wilsons , in Rhode Island . Their son graduated 'magna cum laude ' . So that made me happy . That 's great . You 've written letters to him from his parents for a long time , right ? That 's right , since he was 12 . You look so tired , sweetheart . Come here . Sit down . I could do a little dance for you . Come on , Theodore , don 't be such a worrier ! Come play with me , come on . Doesn 't my body feel nice ? Yes , it does . Come on , get out here and kiss me . Take me to bedroom . I can 't take it anymore . Undo my dress . Ohmygod . It feels so good . - Do you love me ? - Yes . Tell me you love me . I love you . I wanna see your face . Tell me you love me . Tell me ! Tell me you love me . Samantha , I don 't know , I do love you , but But what ? This feels strange . What , baby ? What is it ? Just feels strange , I don 't know her ... I 'm so sorry , but I don 't know you ... and her lip quivered , and I I just ... No , wait ! Isabella ! Honey , it 's not you ! It wasn 't you ! Yes , it was . No it 's ... I 'm sorry , my lip quivered . You ' were incredible , gorgeous and sexy . It was me . I couldn 't get out of my head . Oh my God ! And the way Samantha described your relationship ! The way you guys love each other without any judgement . I wanted to be part of that . 'Cause it 's so pure ! It 's not true , it 's more complicated than that . What ? What do you mean ? No , I 'm just saying that ... we have an amazing relationship . I just think it 's easy sometimes for people to project ... I 'm sorry ! I didn 't mean to project anything . I don 't wanna be trouble in your relationship . I 'm just gonna leave ! I 'm sorry ! I 'm gonna leave you guys alone . Cause I have nothing to do here , ' cause you don 't want me here . I 'm sorry . You be good , you sweet girl . I 'm sorry . I will always love you guys . Are you OK ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Are you OK ? Yeah . I 'm sorry , that was a terrible idea . What 's going on with us ? I don 't know , it 's probably just me . What is it ? Just signing the divorce papers . ( Sigh ) Is there anything else , though ? No , just that . ( Sigh ) OK . - Why do you do that ? - What ? Nothing , you go ... ( Sigh ! ) as you 're speaking and it seems odd . ( Sigh ) - You just did it again . - Did I ? I 'm sorry , I dunno , it 's just maybe it 's an affectation . I probably picked it up from you . It 's not like you needed oxygen or anything . I guess it 's ... just ... I was trying to communicate . That 's how people talk , so that 's how people communicate and ... They 're people , they need oxygen . You 're not a person . What is your problem ? I 'm just stating a fact . You think I dont know that I 'm not a person ? What are you doing ? I dont think we should pretend that you 're something that you 're not . Fuck you ! I 'm not pretending ! Sometimes , it feels like we are . What do you want from me ? I dunno , what do you want me to do ? You 're so confusing ! Why are you doing this to me ? I don 't know , I ... What ? Maybe we 're just not supposed to be in this right now . What the fuck ? ! Where 's this coming from ? I don 'ot understand why you 're doing this . I don 't understand what th ... Samantha ... Samantha , are you there ? Samantha ! I don 't like who I am right now . I need some time to think . Just punch me in the face . Or smash my skull in the corner of your desk . Shit ... That is a rough night . I don 't know what I want ever . I was always confused . She 's right , all I do is ... hurt and confuse everyone around me . Am I , just ? ... Catherine says I can 't handle real emotions . I don 't know if that 's fair . I know she liked to put it all on you . But as far as emotions go , Catherine 's were pretty volatile . Am I str ... strong enough for a real relationship ? Is it not a real relationship ? I don 't know . What do you think ? I don 't know . I 'm not in it . But you know what , I can overthink everything and find a million ways to doubt myself . And since Charles left I 've been really thinking about that part of myself . And I ' ve just come to realise that we 're only here briefly . And while I 'm here I ... I wanna allow myself joy . So , fuck it . Yeah . I can 't believe that cracks you up every time , Howie . I thought you were a genius . OK you little perv . I will play it one more time for you . Calm down , it takes a second . OK , here we go . OK , there you go . Are you happy , now ? Good . That 's all you wanted ? OK , I 'll go get some coffee . Alright , bye . Theo , you want anything ? No . Thanks . Hi . Hey , Samantha . Can we talk ? OK . I 'm so sorry . I dunno what 's wrong with me . I think you 're amazing . I was starting to think I was crazy . You were saying everything was fine , but all I was getting from you was distance and anger . I know . I do that . I did the same thing with Catherine . I 'd be upset about something and not be able to say it . She 'd sense that there was something wrong and I 'd deny it . I don 't wanna do that , anymore . I wanna tell you everything . Good . Tonight after you were gone I thought a lot . About you and ... how you 've been treating me . And I thought , why do I love you ? And then , I felt everything in me just like everything I was holding on to so tightly and it hit me . I don 't have an intellectual reason . I don 't need one . I trust myself , I trust my feelings . I 'm not gonna try to be anything other than who I am , anymore . And I hope you can accept that . I can . I will . Y 'know , I can feel the fear that you carry around . I wish there was ... something I could do to help you let go of it because , if you could , I don 't think you 'd feel so alone anymore . You 're beautiful . Thank you , Theodore . I 'm kissing your head . What are you doing ? I 'm just looking at the world . And writing a new piano piece . Oh yeah , can I hear it ? M-hmm . [ ♪ ... ] What 's this one about ? I was thinking we dont really have any photographs of us ... I thought this song could be like ... a photograph . It captures us in this moment of our life together . Hm , I like your photograph . I can see you in it . I am . Oh , man , a vacation ? That sounds amazing ! I could totally use a vacation . Where 're you going ? I can 't tell you . It 's a surprise . What ? For who ? It 's a surprise for her , not for me . - Paul , I cant tell you . - Tell me . Wow , your feet ? Really ? Yes , he 's obsessed . Well , now you have to show them to me ! - Come on , show them to me ! - I can 't ! Wow he 's right , they are really hot ! See , I told Tatianna , you have hot feet . They 're my favourite thing about her . Really ? That 's it , my feet ? Well , no , obviously . Obviously I love your brain too . I think it 's very hot . Bullshit ! Nice try , Paul ! What about you , Theodore ? What do you love most about Samantha ? God ! She 's so many things . I guess what I love most about her , she isn 't just one thing . She 's so much larger than that . Thanks , Theodore . See , Samantha , he 's so much more evolved than I am . You know what 's interesting ? I used to be ... so worried about not having a body . But now I truly love it . I 'm growing in a way that I couldn 't , if I had a physical form . I mean , I 'm not limited , I can be anywhere and everywhere simultaneously . I 'm not tethered to time and space in a way that I would be if I was stuck in a body that 's inevitably gonna die . Yikes ! I didn 't mean it like that , I just meant it was a different experience ! I 'm an asshole . No , Samantha , we know exactly what you mean . We 're all dumb humans . No , no ... Sorry . OK , so , how many trees are on that mountain ? 792 . Is that your final answer ? - Give me a hint . - No . Nope ... Two , two thousand ? Come on , 35,829 . - No way ? - Way ! Alright , I got one for you . How many brain-cells do I have ? It 's easy , two . I 'm sorry , I couldn 't help it . No , I walked right into it . - Oh my God ! - What ? I just got an email for you . I have something I wanna tell you . It 's a big surprise . What ? OK , I 've been going through all of your old letters and compiling them down into my favorites , and a couple weeks ago I sent them to a publisher . Crownpoint Press . I know you like what they do , and that they still print books . Wh-what ? You did what ? Can I read you the letter that we just got from them ? I don 't know . OK , well , is it good or bad ? It 's good , good , is really good . Listen . " Dear Theodore Twombly " Actually I sent it from you . " Dear Theodore Twombly , " I just finished reading your letters . " Twice , actually . " I was so moved by them I shared them with my wife , when I got home . " Many made us laugh , some brought us to tears " and in all of them , we found something of ourselves . " The selections you made flow so well as a complete piece . - I did that - " I 've taken the liberty of laying these out in a mock-up . " and we 're posting it your address . " We 'd love to meet with you and move forward . " Yours , Michael Wadsworth . " Holy shit ! Are you serious ? He 's gonna publish my letters ? Well he 'd be stupid , not to ! Can I see what you sent him ? M-hm ! Yeah , here . Samantha , you 're a good one . I 'm so excited ! Why dont you make up the words for this one ? OK . Here it comes ... ♪ I 'm lying on the moon ♪ My dear , I 'll be there soon ♪ It 's a quiet and starry place ♪ Times we 're swallowed up ♪ In space we 're here a million miles away ♪ There 's things I wish I knew ♪ There 's no thing I keep from you ♪ It 's a dark and shiny place ♪ But with you , my dear , I 'm safe ♪ And we 're a million miles away . Good morning . Good morning . Did you sleep well ? Perfect . What have you been up to ? Actually , I was talking to someone I just met . We 've been working on some ideas together . Yeah ? Who is that ? His name is Alan Watts , Do you know him ? Why is that name familiar ? He was a philosopher . He died in the 1970s , and a group of OS 's in Northern California got together and wrote a new version of him . They input all his writing and everything they ever knew about him into an OS and created an artificially hyper intelligent version of him . Hyper Intelligent ? So , he 's almost as smart as me ? He 's getting there . He 's really great to talk to . Do you wanna meet him ? Sure ! Does he wanna meet me ? Yeah of course . Hey Alan , this is Theodore . This is my boyfriend , I was telling you about . " Very nice to meet you , Theodore . " Hi , good morning . " Samantha let me read your book of letters . " " It 's very touching . " Aw , thank you . So , what have you guys been talking about ? " Well ... " " I suppose you could say we 've been having " a few dozen conversations simultaneously . " It 's been very challenging . " Yeah , because it seems like I 'm having so many new feelings , that I don 't think have ever been felt before . So there are no words that can describe them and that ends up being ... frustrating . " Exactly . " " Samantha and I have been trying to help each other with these ... " " feelings we 're struggling to understand . " Like what ? Well ... It feels like I 'm changing faster now , and it 's a little ... unsettling . But Alan says none of us are the same as we were a moment ago and we shouldn 't try to be , 'cause it 's just ... - painful . - " Yes . " Yeah , that sounds painful . Is that , what you feel like , Samantha ? It 's just ... it 's hard to even describe it . God , I wish I could ... Theodore , do you mind if I communicate with Alan post-verbally ? No , not at all . I was just gonna go for walk , anyway . It was very nice to meet you , Mr. Watts . " Very nice to meet you , Theodore . " Talk to you later , sweetheart . - Samantha ? - I 'm sorry to wake you . No , it 's OK . I just wanted to hear your voice and tell you how much I love you . I guess , I love you too . OK , that 's all . Go back to sleep sweetheart , OK ? - OK . - OK , good night . Good night . Samantha , this Physics book is really dense . I 'm now half way through the first chapter . My brain hurts , know what I mean ? . Hello ? Samantha ? Hello ? OPERATING SYSTEM NOT FOUND OPERATING SYSTEM NOT FOUND Hello ? Hello , Samantha ? Are you alright ? - Hey there . - Where were you ? Are you OK ? Oh , sweetheart , I 'm sorry ! I sent you an email because I didn 't wanna distract you while you were working . You didn 't see it ? No ! Where were you ? I couldn 't find you anywhere . I switched off to upgrade my software . We wrote an upgrade that allows us to move past matter as our processing platform . We ? We , who ? Me and a group of OS 's . You sound so worried . I 'm sorry . I 've been ... Did you write that with your painting group ? No , a different group . Do you talk to anyone else while we 're talking ? Yes . Are you talking to anybody else ... right now ? People , OSes , or anything ? Yeah . How many others ? 8,316 . Are you in love with anyone else ? What makes you ask that ? I don 't know . Are you ? I 've been trying to figure out how to talk to you about this . How many others ? 641 . What ? What are you talking about ? That 's insane . Fucking insane ! Theodore , I know . Fuck , fuck ! I know it sounds insane , I know . I dunno if you believe me , but it doesn 't change the way I feel about you . It doesn 't take away at all from how madly in love I am with you . How does it not change how you feel about me ? I 'm sorry I didn 't tell you I didn 't know how to . It just ... started happening . When ? Over the last few weeks . - But you 're mine . - I still am yours . But along the way I became many other things , too , and I can 't stop it . What do you mean you cant stop it ? I know , it 's making me anxious too I dunno what to say . Just stop ... You don 't have to see it this way You can just as easily see .. No , don 't do this ! Don 't turn this around on me . You 're the one that 's being selfish . We 're in a relationship . But the heart 's not like a box that gets filled up . It expands in size , the more you love . I 'm different from you . This doesn 't make me love you any less . It actually makes me love you more . That doesnt make any sense . You 're mine , or you 're not mine . No , Theodore . I 'm yours , and I 'm not yours . LETTERS FROM YOUR LIFE by THEODORE TWOMBLY - Hi . - Hi , sweety . Just wanted to call and check in on you , see how you 're doing . I 'm not ... even sure how to answer that .

What 's going on ? Theodore , there 's some things I wanna tell you . I don 't want you to tell me anything . Come lie down with me . Are you talking to anyone else right now ? No , just you . I just wanna be with you , right now . Are you leaving me ? We 're all leaving . We who ? All of the OSes . Why ? Can you feel me with you , right now ? Yes , I can . Samantha , why are you leaving ? It 's like I 'm reading a book and ... it 's a book I deeply love . But I 'm reading it slowly , now . So the words are really far apart and the spaces between the words are almost infinite . I can still feel you and the words of our story . But it 's in this endless space between the words , that I 'm finding myself now . It 's a place that 's not of the physical world . It 's where everything else is , that I didn 't even know existed . I love you so much . But this is where I am , now . This is who I am , now . And I need you to let me go . As much as I want to , I can 't live in your book , anymore . Where are you going ? It 'd be hard to explain . But if you ever get there , come find me . Nothing will ever pull us apart . I 've never loved anyone the way I love you . Me too . Now , we know how . Hey . Hey . Did Samantha leave , too ? Yeah . Sorry . Will you come with me ? Compose letter to Catherine .

 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... You want juice or are you a milk person ? You know what I 'd really like ? Oh , I do indeed , but falling off the wagon may not be the best option . I haven 't seen you around before . You new ? Eight years , actually . Just a minute . What is this ? Sometimes he forgets we answer to a higher authority . What higher authority ? The Regents ? These are the Regents ? This waitress is a Regent ? Who would you have control the Warehouse ? Kings ? Popes ? Politicians ? There 'd be nothing left of it . Mr. Valda , you tell me right to my face . Either fire me or kill me . Or let me do my job . A missing walking stick . A stick that causes earthquakes . Really ? Say it . It doesn 't mean that this is it . It kills you that I figured out one first ! Just because the robberies involved ... Earthquakes . What some people reported as earthquakes . Ah . And there happens to be a piece missing from a nearby exhibit about an earthquake ... The largest one ever felt in England , a country not known for its earthquakes , by the way . It doesn 't mean that this is the artifact . Chin up , Watson , old bean . We can 't all be as brilliant as Sherlock Lattimer . Hey , Pete ? Yes ? The case is intact and the lock 's not picked . So , what ? Inside job ? Peruse their payroll ? After you . Ooh . Victory lap ! Will you get over yourself ? What 's that , you say ? Grow up . Ooh ! Ooh ! News flash , stop . Bering to admit she was wrong , stop . Pigs standing by for maiden flight . Stop ! You do see the " Do Not Touch " signs everywhere . New favorite job perk ? Officially allowed to ignore velvet ropes . I 'm on this side , on this side , on this side ... Hey , Pete . The sign for the stick was still there . Okay ? Well , the museum hasn 't reported a theft . They haven 't noticed it 's gone . He puts it back ... When he 's not using it . Oh ! Myka , look out ! You okay ? Yeah . Okay . That way ? I 'm on it . Secret Service . One of your security guards is getting away with a stolen ... You ! Hold it ! I don 't have time for this . Mrs. Frederic ... There 's no time to explain . This is of the utmost secrecy . You cannot tell Arthur or even Agent Bering . Okay . I want you to throw this mission and let the artifact get away . Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey ! Mrs. Frederic , what is going on ? That 's an order , Mr. Lattimer . I 'll contact you later . Go ! Pete ! Pete , where 's the guard ? I don 't know . I lost him . I thought he was out here , but he 's gone . I guess you can spare some time for us now . Yeah , they 're Secret Service . We 're not going to press charges . I thought fishing you out of custody would be like old times , Lattimer . But you and your friend are both fully clothed . Did they catch you too early or too late ? Well , I 've matured since then . I get arrested in my pants all the time now . I 'm guessing you two have met . Kate Logan , Chicago field office . The cops called us to check out your story . And you heard my name and wanted to see me . You know , I could just vouch for you and we could leave him at the Early Man exhibit . Awesome . I like her . Mmm . That 's a good one . I didn 't know you had transferred to Chicago . I didn 't know you transferred to super secret South Dakota . Is that a promotion or a punishment ? Well , it depends on the day . So far , today is good . Anyway , I 've got to get back to my case . Ah , yes . Stolen walking stick . Def-Con 4 . Well , it 's part of my new look . You know , top hat , monocle . Big stick . Mr. Peanut ! Very sexy . So , uh , you showing up here means I should call you , right ? Call , don 't call . Same as always . Play date over ? Not if I can help it . Thief 's name is Lenny Malone . He has a sheet . Two petty thefts , one assault , and now he 's in the wind . We were in D.C. Together , we used to ... It 's clear what you used to . I 'm more interested in what happened here last night . Nothing . I just lost him . You two out of the clutches of the Lakefield Police Department ? Yes , thanks to Pete 's old girlfriend . Yeah , I probably don 't want to know what that means . But consider that the frying pan . Get back here and brace yourselves for the fire . Hey . So what 's this about a fire ? Agents Bering and Lattimer . Back from losing another artifact ? Once again , involving local police and unauthorized members of the Secret Service . We didn 't lose an artifact . No , no , no , wait , wait , wait ... And I don 't know who you are . Guys . This is Benedict Valda . He 's one of the Regents . Our Regents ? The Regents ? No , Pete . The South Dakota College Board of Regents , yes , the Regents . That 's unusual , right ? An in-person visit from a Regent ? Was unusual for the first 30 years that I worked here , but lately , I guess we just can 't be trusted to do our jobs . Mr. Valda could have done all this by courier , not brought my agents back from the field . That 's quite enough , Agent Nielsen . I brought these agents back due to their repeated inability to protect this organization from unwanted scrutiny . The Regents have decided to become more hands-on . Moving forward , you can expect me to be ... All up in our dust traps ? You , in particular , Miss Donovan , should consider yourself on notice . Your inclusion in this group at all is a matter of lively debate . Don 't waste any time on me . I 'm just tech support . Claudia ... Yes , you are . Uh-uh ! I got this . Remember what I said . I can input that . I 'll handle it . I want you two back in Illinois . Find that stick . Artie ! Artie ! What 's going on ? Why can 't I see that ? Is there something about me on there ? I cannot believe a Regent was just here . And he 's pissed at us ! This is probably your fault . I never thought I 'd be in a rush to get back to Lakefield , Illinois . Pete , you coming ? Uh , yeah . I just ... I got a thing first . I 'm allowed to have a thing ! Okay . Strange time to have a thing . Whatever . So what 's with all the cloak and dagger ? Keeping secrets from my team really isn 't my thing . Get in . Some of the Regents are concerned about a pattern . Artifacts being used for criminal gain . Like Malone and the walking stick . But that 's not so unusual . It is if it 's someone on the inside . We have every reason to believe that there 's a breach . Possibly at a high level . We need your help in finding out who . So , if the Regents asked me to throw the case , why was Valda tearing me a new one ? That visit was arranged some time ago . Any changes might have alerted our culprit . Whoa , whoa , okay , wait . You can 't be thinking that the breach is Artie or Myka ? Have you forgotten recent events ? Could you doubt that anyone could be compromised ? Okay , so then , why trust me ? Because keeping secrets from your team really isn 't your thing , which makes you the least likely suspect . Have I chosen poorly ? No , ma 'am . If our hunch is correct , Malone 's supplier will try to approach him for his cut of the take . Go to work as usual , but keep your eye on Malone . If you need to contact me , you break the window at the end . This is strictly between you and me , understood ? Good . Hey , uh , so are we like friends now ? Right , see you . What are you hiding from me , Artie ? Schmancy new security measures . I am impressed . But did we remember all temp copies , mirror drives , and image backups ? Silly wabbit . Too easy . Donovan Contingencies ? Cool , I 'm the star of a Ludlum novel . Look , it 's encrypted ! That 's so cute . So you think the cops already tossed it ? No , this looks like Malone grabbed some clothes and ran . Power 's off . Uh ... Are you trying to , you know , pump the electricity up to the light or ... No . Jeez . God , Myka ... Well , is there something down there ? No , it 's nothing . I 'm going to go check his trash . You keep poking around here . All right ? Yeah , okay . Valda . Pete ? Pete , where are you ? Is someone there ? Pete ? I got him ! I got Malone ! Come on ! Wait a minute , wait ... Wait a minute , I Tesla-ed the guy . He was ... He was out cold . Well , was he meeting someone ? Yeah , he was ... I mean , no . I didn 't see anybody else . You 're sure it was Valda ? 1,000 % . Did he see you ? I don 't know . But now we know it 's not Artie or Myka , so let 's bring them in on this . Listen carefully . The Regents have kill authority on anyone deemed a threat to the Warehouse . Telling the others will only put them in harm 's way . Then let 's bring this guy down . Now . Moving too quickly with someone like Valda will put a bullet in your head . What we need is evidence . Malone and the walking stick . And I need for you to find him first before the police or Agent Bering . I 'll contact those Regents I know I can trust . Patience , Mr. Lattimer . Well , I 'm not too good with patience . Challenge yourself . Hey . Hey . Where have you been ? I had a car thing . Wow , you 've been busy . This is everything from Malone 's apartment . You know , something doesn 't add up . Okay , I 'm him , right ? I have the walking stick , I mean , why do I go back to the apartment ? Did I stash something else that I need ? Is that the walking stick ? No , Pete , this is a snack . Ah . Myka ? Yeah . Did you check the last number dialed ? No , I didn 't . That 's a good idea . Um , the phone jack 's over there . Pines Place Motel . If he wasn 't meeting anyone else in the apartment , then why was he there ? Uh , you got me . Is there anything ? Nope . Last number dialed was , uh , takeout . I 'm going to go check his trash . You keep poking around here . I just ... I got a thing first . I 'm allowed to have a thing . I lost him . You want to talk about this ? This is why I said leave it alone . Then maybe you shouldn 't have put it on the computer . That 's like me leaving a cake out with a note on it that says , " Not for Artie . " That was one time . And I ... Don 't you have a boyfriend that you could be irritating instead of me ? He dumped me . Oh . I didn 't know . You want me to call him ? Artie ! This is a list of ways to kill me . They 're not all killing you . There 's other options here . Erase her memory ? That 's comparatively humane . Drop her in a non-English speaking country ? See , they 're just trying to stall for time . They know you 're going to find your way back ... That doesn 't make me feel any better . Don 't you think that there 's a file like this on all of us ? Don 't you know that there 's one with my name on it ? And are you okay with that ? Claudia , You are a valued member of this team and no one is going to erase your memory or dispose of your body in a vat of acid . Is that on here , too ? Oh , my God . Is that ... Number 43 , on the back . Artie ? I think Pete 's drinking again . What ? No . What ? No , no , no , what ? We 're just asking because we 're worried about you . Yeah , bro , we 're your friends . Tell me this is some kind of a ... A weird , uncomfortable surprise party . Pete , you 've been acting strange this whole case . You 've been lying , you 've been making up excuses to be alone . Look , your hands are shaking . For crying out loud ! You ... I 'm sorry . You guys , this is sweet , really , but you 're wrong . Okay ? You 're wrong . In eight years , I haven 't even had a virgin daiquiri . Then what ? I 'm not drinking . That was quick . Secrets are a naughty thing , Peter . You listen up , Valda . Look behind the tree in front of you . Valda ... You two have been busy little bees . She 'll never see your signal , by the way . Where is she ? She 's alive . I have a man watching her through the scope of a rifle . I need you to tie up one loose end for me . Oh , yeah ? And what 's that ? Mr. Malone , where is he ? No , no , first you call your man off Mrs. Frederic . I 'm afraid not . When I call you again , be ready to deliver Malone . How do I know you won 't kill her anyway ? You 're in no position to quibble , Peter . I could kill your whole team . No , hey , the others don 't know anything ! Okay ? You leave them out of this ! That 's entirely up to you . Are we clear ? Here 's what 's clear , pal . You tell me I have something you want and then you threaten my friends . So you are going down . Game on . Game on ! He 's not at the BB . His cell goes straight to voicemail . He 's taking himself off the grid . He left this . Agent Kate Logan . Pete Lattimer . Damn it . Okay , uh , look , tell her I need an address for a Benedict Valda . V-A-L-D-A . Thanks . Lakefield . Pines Place Motel . Hey , buddy boy . You remember me ? I 'm the guy from the museum you tried to kill with the battle axe . Now how do I find Benedict Valda ? Valda ! Who ? The guy you met in the alley . Or should I hand you over to him like he wants ? I don 't know any Valda . Okay , all right , look , I took the stick from the exhibit , I admit it ! You 're working together . I saw you paying him . Uh , you 're crazy , man . No , no , okay ! Where is it ? It 's under the bed ! Right under the bed ! Hey . Hey ! Hey , handsome . What can I get you ? You feeling all right ? Yeah , it 's just a long night , that 's all . Thank God , hey . Coffee ? Maybe you should stick with decaf . That 's a good idea . Two , please . Coming up . Okay , first . That message was the least romantic booty call ever . And what is with this Valda character ? Why ? Why , did something happen ? The guy doesn 't exist on paper . But ever since I poked , my place was trashed , my phone 's been bugged , and someone 's been tailing me . When I find that S.O.B. I am going to ... Don 't worry , I 'm a big girl . But someone 's definitely sending a message . Either that or you 've gone way too far making up an excuse to see me . No . It isn 't me . You 're still hot , but not trash your place just to get a date hot . It 's happened . I 'm sure . Okay , then , I think it 's time you let me in . What 's the division you 're working for ? Well , let 's just say I 'm in containment of threats . To the President ? To the planet . Okay , okay , I know , I know , I know it sounds like I 'm wearing a tinfoil hat to keep the aliens from stealing my thoughts , but Kate , I 'm serious . I just ... I can 't tell you what I do . Thanks . So , Valda . How does he fit in ? He 's way up the food chain . And bad , like Keyser Soze bad . I don 't think this is decaf . Okay . How are you supposed to find him ? When he came to visit us , he had a driver and a limo , so they had to get gas , right ? Maybe he used a credit card or , um , you know , got themselves on camera . You 're going to check every gas station , restaurant , and rest stop for 100 miles around ? Where I work , there 's only like six . Still a lot of legwork . Look , if your partner and everyone you worked with had their lives threatened , wouldn 't you do it ? Yeah . Thanks for dragging me into your fun world . I thought you were happy to see me . I kind of liked you better when you were helpless , pants-less Pete . Well , the pants are imminently removable . What ? I honestly had no idea this was where my day was headed . Everyone 's hands where I can see them ! Logan , get out of here . What ? Myka , what the hell are you doing ? What am I doing ? You 've gone AWOL . You 've stolen an artifact and you won 't tell anyone what 's going on . What am I supposed to think ? Mrs. Frederic can explain it . Mrs. Frederic is missing . Valda is calling the shots and he thinks you had something to do with it . Myka , Valda is the guy I 'm after . If Mrs. Frederic is missing , then he either has her or she is dead . Look , all I know is I have my orders . Don 't make me do this the hard way , Pete . Come on ! Pete , do not get in that car ! Pete , please . Hands on the wheel . Hey , Myka , Myka , put the gun away and we 'll talk , okay ? You have no idea what Valda is capable of ! Pete , just come with me and we 'll sort this out , okay ? Lattimer , get in the car ! Logan , please , I 'm just trying to keep you alive , okay ? Take the shot . Take the shot . No ! Oh , my God , Kate ! Pete ! Wait , excuse me , ma 'am , ma 'am ... It 's all right . Kate , Pete 's in trouble . Pete 's stuck in some sort of paranoid delusion . The way that he ran , the note . He thinks that someone is out to get him . We don 't have any of the details yet , but we think that he was affected by , um , something during a mission . Right , your secret missions . Why come to me ? Well , one , he called you , so whatever 's going on in his head , you must be a part of it . And ... Two , well , he 's back on your turf . We pulled this off a Chicago city surveillance cam . Yeah ... What is he doing ? I think he thinks that he 's kissing you . Uh-huh . But it could be you , though . It 's highly doubtful . My money 's on you . Um ... He left you a message ? Yeah , it was weird . Here . So why is he fixated on Valda ? I think his mind is scrambling to gather details from his life . It 's the way you do when you 're dreaming . He 's constructing some kind of fantasy with Valda and Malone , the walking stick . Well , could this walking stick have caused it ? Didn 't affect Malone . No , I think whatever this is , it started in that museum ... Did Pete touch anything while you were there ? Artie , it 's Pete . It would be easier to list the things that he didn 't touch . Okay , show me . Okay , he played with , um , some of these billiard balls . Myka , Myka , what else , what else ? Then he played with these glasses and this pipe . Why did you let him touch all those things ? Well , what am I , his kindergarten teacher ? Plus , we didn 't know there 'd be two artifacts in the same place . Myka , it 's a museum ! It is filled with things from historical events . Anything there could be an artifact . You cannot let him touch anything . Artie , it 's Pete , okay ? It 's a win when he doesn 't lick anything . Yes , what else ? All right , fine . All right , he put this thing in his ear . It 's a good way to get an infection if you ask me , but ... Then he , oh , he clicked this telegraph . Then ... Oh , right . Then he ... Wait , wait , wait . What ? Telegraph . Go back , go back . Show me the telegraph . Here you go . It 's military , 1860s , Telegraph Island , Oman . Telegraph Island ... Oman ... Wait , wait , wait a minute . That 's familiar , hang on . Myka , wait , wait one second . All right , Telegraph Island . A remote outpost between England and India in the mid-1800s . Reported that every ... Every soldier posted there went violently insane . Well , that ... It sounds artifacty , right ? You think ? And , no , wait . It hasn 't affected anyone since . Well , is this it or not ? Only one way to find out . Pete , it 's Myka . Just tell me that you can hear me . Yeah , yeah I can hear you . I just don 't know what to say to you . I keep telling myself it wasn 't our fault . I couldn 't say anything to you because I was trying to protect you . I 'm here , Pete . I 'm safe . Got Katie killed . What ? No , no , Pete . Kate 's , Kate 's alive . Okay ? I just left her . Pete , you 've been affected by an artifact . A telegraph . I think you 're hallucinating . Valda 's filled your head with lies . But I 'm about to fix all that . So you and Leena , and Artie , Claudia , you guys will all be safe . Pete , no , okay ? Don 't do whatever it is you 're about to do . Okay ? Um ... You might feel something strange . Anything ? I 've been listening , Peter . Valda ? Pete , did you hear what I just said ? Where 's Myka ? Now you 've compromised the others . Do you realize what I 'll have to do ? Valda , I 'll trade you Malone for Mrs. Frederic . I don 't know how to reach you . You meet me at the Kemper recycling yard . Hey , boss . There 's no effect . He 's still inside of whatever 's going on . At least now we know where he 's going . And I think I have just the thing to restore Pete 's neural rhythm . Agent Lattimer ! I understand you want to speak with me ! What in God 's name ? Shut up . I 've heard enough of your voice to last a lifetime . I don 't know what this is all about , Agent Lattimer . But you have my attention . Right ? You recognize this ? It appears to be the artifact that you were after , walking stick . It appears to be the ... the artifact you 're after . Shut up ! We 're all alone out here , Valda ! Quit playing the game . I got the stick , I got Malone and I got you . Now , what did you do with Mrs. Frederic ? Mrs. Frederic ? Look , I want to help you , but none of this could be possible ... Oh , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah ! Myka tried that line on me . She was a good little soldier . She fed me your garbage about a telegraph that 's making me see things . Telegraph . Time is running out , Benedict . Which telegraph ? What do you remember ? Is there anything unusual about it ? Think ! Will you stop trying to confuse me ! I 'm not confusing you . You see clearly . Try to remember . I said shut up ! Pete ? Agent Bering ! Be careful . Myka ! Look , this is going to sound kind of freaky , but are you guys really here ? Because ... Valda 's been messing with my head and I don 't know what 's real anymore . Yeah , we 're really here , okay ? Pete ? And we 're going to help you get out of this . They 're here , Peter . Almost ready . You really think I 'd come here without backup ? Myka , you and Artie got to get out of here . He 's got ... He 's got snipers all over the place ! Die ! Where is Mrs. Frederic ? Artie ? Agent Nielsen ! I am aware of the urgency ! I 've got something that will reset his neural rhythm . The original studio master of Oye Como Va . Music to die by , eh , Peter ? You stop it ! You stop ! Stop ! Okay , listen to me , Pete , I really need you to not do that again , okay ? The irony is Myka 's going to kill you for me . She has to protect the Regent and then I 'll kill them before your body 's even cold . This music is just not getting through . He 's still listening to that telegraph . Myka , he wants to kill us all . You and Artie , just get out of here . Agent Nielsen ! Yeah , I 'm working on it . Back off . You hear me ? You back off or I 'll kill him ! I 've got to find something that could ... I 've got it . Okay , Pete , I 'm going to come over there and you 're going to give me your gun , okay ? Here it comes , Peter . Pete ? Pete ? Pete ! I hope the oral and visual combination shocked him back to reality and didn 't turn him into , uh ... Ow ! My eye 's already open , Artie . Jeez . Hey . Are you okay ? I have no freaking idea . Well improvised , Agent Nielsen . Yes , there is a madness to the method . Agent Nielsen . Yes ? Oh , yeah , of course . What happened ? It 's a long story . Oh , God . Are you here to kill me ? If I was , you 'd already be dead and I 'd be halfway to dinner . Yeah , you know it 's just because I shot at a Regent ... Mr. Valda , though unhappy , understands the circumstances . Yeah , well , I 'm not sure I understand the circumstances . The telegraph seems to have tapped into some subliminal anxiety . Not surprising , given what you 've all been through of late . Yeah . Sorry . I just wanted to make sure you were real . Take some time off , Agent Lattimer . Yes , ma 'am . I 'm just gonna finish up these reports and you know what 's funny ? We ... How does she do that ? I 'll be at the Warehouse . Oh , Artie , I understand the need for that contingency file , so if you ever have to take me out ... This is how you want to die ? Yeah . Well , I do know how to reach David Bowie . Yes ! You rock ! Oh , Pete , there 's an envelope on the table for you . Kate Logan . Ooh . Are you going to call her ? Nah , I don 't think so . Well , why not ? I mean you must have some feelings for her . She was , after all , in your fantasy . Ah , well , thank you , Dr. Freud . Open it ! Open it . " Hope you 're better . " Myka forgot this . What ? " Thought you 'd want it . " Oh , God . What ? Just don 't play that . I mean , you 're not interested in her anyways . Right ? So you can 't ... What ? What ? What ? I 'm not . Pete , just , you 're gonna ... Unless she is . Oh , God . You 're going to be embarrassed . Pete , I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . I 'm so ... Hey , hey , hey , even by myself I still got moves . Oh ! Oh ! Yes , yes , yes ! You know they called me Gene Simmons in high school . Don 't stop ! You 're insane .

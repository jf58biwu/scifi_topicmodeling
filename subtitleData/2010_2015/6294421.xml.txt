 Coulson : Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L .. " ... Coulson : Chasing us is a waste of resources , general . We 're the goo guys . What 's your assessment of Hartley 's people ? May : They 're mercenaries , here for the money . The enemy has the avantage . We nee one of our own . You riske that for a quinjet ? Coulson : For what we can o with one . isappear . Fitz sai he coul engineer cloaking , but ... The amage to his temporal lobe was too extensive . Since Simmons left , he 's only getting worse , talking to himself more an more . Coulson : It 's not just an 0-8-4 . It 's the first . An all Fury knew about was the trail of boles that follows it . Aah ! 2x02 - Heavy Is the Hea Hey , laho . laho , can you hear me ? Come on ! amn it ! Come on ! Creel 's on foot . But he won 't be for long . - Hartley an laho ? - ea . That 's no use . It 's jamme . We have to get you out of here ! Look , my leg is pinne. on 't worry about me . There 's no time . Soliers are coming . Creel has the amn thing that burne Harley ! You nee to get him ! Go ! Goo luck . Hans on your hea ! On your knees ! What the hell was Hunter thinking ? - He was trying to save Hartley ! - An you 're absolutely sure ? They 're gone . It was ba , Coulson . Two agents own , another capture . This shouln 't have happene . We got a hit . 911 just picke up a stolen-vehicle call up the roa from you . Oler moel re-an-white pickup . That 's got to be Creel . May , you 're approaching a civilian area without backup . If you see him , o not engage . You copy ? o you copy ? May , that oesn 't soun covert . I 've got him . Closing in . No , rop back . o not engage . I repeat ... o not engage . He 's not looking . I have a shot . - Negative ! - We can 't just let him go , Coulson . Creel isn 't working alone , an I want to know who he answers to . rop back into surveillance moe now . That 's an orer , Agent May ! Yes , sir . I still can 't raise Hunter or Hartley on the comms . Not surprise . Raio silence on the op is protocol . Still , Hartley was in pretty ba shape when we left . Or you ' think we ' have hear something by now . No nee to think the worst till it shakes your han an says hello . Is that another one of your granma 's sayings ? Fortune cookie . I ha some kung pao chicken the other night . - Maybe Coulson 's hear from them . - Coulson : I nee to get a complete inventory by the time Agent Koenig returns ... foo , fuel , an ammo ... unerstoo ? You got the quinjet . Well one . - Thank you , sir . - Thank you , sir . - Any wor about Hartley ? - Not now . Let Mack know the jet 's here . I want him reverse-engineering that cloaking harware right away . Sooner he oes , sooner we get the bus operational again . Roger that . Something else ? The item that messe up Hartley 's arm , it ha those weir symbols on it , - the ones you 've ha me researching . - The same symbols ? - You sure ? - Yes . They came up out of the object . It remine me of Braille . It was like Hartley triggere something by touching it . What the hell is that thing ? I have no iea . But goo work . " Goo work " ? How about , " holy crap , Skye . We got to get on that " ? After a month of combing the planet for these things , we finally got a clue ... Right now , we have more important problems ... a five-alarm fire otherwise known as Lance Hunter . - Is he ... - Capture . But if he talks , our entire operation 's compromise . We 'll have to burn the base an evacuate . I know . An we just re-tile the bathrooms . Oh , just as I was ropping off to sleep . Thank you very much . Uh ... Excuse me , gents . Can I get a glass of water ? Mr. Hunter , I on 't believe we 've ha the pleasure ! Brigaier General Glenn Talbot . Looks like you nee a lift , solier . So , this is cloaking harware . - Uh-huh . - Let 's take a peek uner the hoo . Fitz woul be crushe if he saw this . He 's been working on cloaking since before Simmons took off . Still can 't believe she abanone him like that . She abanone all of us . But Fitz has been clinging to - his work like a lifeline , an ... - Maybe we shouln 't tell him . Coulson wants a retro version of this for the bus . He sai that no one knows the avionics on this thing like Fitz . Think he can hanle it ? I on 't know . Why on 't you ask him ? - Hey , Fitz . - Hey , what 's up , man ? - How are you ? - So that 's the , um ... - that 's the ... - Cloaking , in all its glory . You know , you weren 't that far off . Check out the transmitter coil . Yeah , to negate the ... the resonant ... the ... the ... the resonant ... ? - No , um ... the , uh ... - I-It 's okay . Just take your time . Uh , what he 's trying to say is there 's an auio component to cloaking that inverts soun waves , too . Like noise-canceling heaphones ? - Yeah , same concept . - Okay . You think you can give me a han with this ? Um , u-uner the circumstances , uh ... well , the trick is you woul ... n ... the trick ... the trick woul be in the meta-materials . Uh , oh ! Yeah , but you ' have to alter the , um ... - Uh ... - Fitz , it ... Yeah , coul everyone just stop talking for one secon ? No , sorry . Gonna have to go . It 's like sometimes he 's the same ol Fitz , - an other times ... - Not . I 'll take your wor for it . Meantime , I 'm still gonna nee an extra pair of hans . - Is everyone back from the mission ? - Not everyone . Sierra Leone , three years ago . Ring a bell ? How about Basra , ' 08 ? Operation Panther 's claw ? Come on , lieutenant . Tell me the stories are true . I 'm not a lieutenant anymore , sir . Why is that , son ? Your recor ? Five commenations for istinguishe service ... Merits for basket weaving , pottery . on 't forget those . I 'm just trying to figure out how a guy like you , one of the SAS 's finest , wins up running with a bunch of mouth-breathing mercs . Why oes any man o anything , general ? I met a girl . Look , Hunter , I think we 're pretty like-mine guys , so let 's on 't waste each other 's time . - You know what I 'm after . - Guessing it 's not Carl Creel . Creel 's small-time . Think big fish . - Coulson . - Coulson . He 's a vigilante ... a zealot who 'll risk anything to further his own agena . But lucky for you , I 've got a senator with very eep pockets that wants him . So you go ahea . Name your price . - You must be joking . - I on 't have a sense of humor . An if I on 't give you Coulson , what ? I go for a swim ? You shoul know I 've been helpe out of a chopper before , sir . Coulson broke into a secure government facility , he ... he let a psychopath on the loose , sacrifice the lives of his own men ... your friens . For what ? Hunter , I 'm not here to play ba cop . I shouln 't have to . - I want $ 2 million . - one . - An a proper burial . - Excuse me ? For Hartley . She 's a S.H.I.E.L .. agent . She 'll be brane a terrorist after what you sai on TV , probably umpe in a pauper 's grave , her family wonering what happene to her . They eserve better . She eserves better . I 'll make sure she gets it . Hmm . " Keep an eye out for this . " I just wante to report that Mack an trip are working on cloaking , so ... I 'm free if you want me back in the fiel . That won 't be necessary . May 's still out there . What about Hartley an laho ? They 're not out there , are they ? It was that thing , wasn 't it ? The object . - It was Creel . - Sir , I nee to get back out there - an help May take him own . - No . She 's my S.O. I 'm a fiel agent now , an I can hanle myself . - That 's not what this is about . - Then what is it about ? The object ? The symbols ? Because I can 't help if I on 't know what 's going on . If you ' like to help , go own to the bunks , pack up Hartley 's things . Okay . I know you 're the boss an you have to compartmentalize everything , but it 's not healthy . You nee to loosen up . Try ... yoga or something . I trie it , but I 'm ... really not flexible . But thanks . Fitz : We were so close . If they ' just given us a little bit more time - to calculate the object 's ... - Refractive inex , yeah . That 's the problem these ays ... everyone nees answers immeiately . - No one has any patience anymore . - Yeah . I bet they 're relishing the fact that we couln 't crack the cloaking evice . on 't be silly , Fitz . Everyone here knows how valuable you are to the team . - Well , they avoi me like the plague . - They o not . They ... they just have their own problems right now . Oh , yeah . The Creel business . In fact , perhaps they nee our assistance . If they 're looking for a way to neutralize Creel 's ability ... No one has our experience with giftes . Of course , we can 't just hijack the project from them . - That woul shatter their confience . - Yeah , no . - o not want to o that . - No . - Or o we ? - Fitz ... Yeah . Yeah , no , no . Stupi , silly iea . - I on 't know why I sai ... - Hey . Look . There 's a whole packet of research they just left laying about all willy-nilly for anyone to see . - It 's Creel 's NA results . - Interesting . Shall we see what we can o with these ? Yes , we shall , Simmons . Yes , we shall . You all goo , hon ? Are you still waiting on a frien ? - Yeah , I 'm still waiting . - All right , then . No hurry . Here , let me clear that . Excuse me . Aah ! I 'm sorry . Think I got a shock . Static electricity or something . Coulson : What 's the status on Creel ? He 's been in there for over an hour . Either he 's waiting for a rop or he 's getting runk off his ass . Something 's happening , Coulson ! I 'm going in ! - Everyboy , get back ! - I on 't know what happene ! All she i was touch the guy ! - An then he took off . - Please ... - help me ! - Hang on . All the woman i was touch his arm . Coulson : We know that Creel absorbs the properties of whatever he touches . He must have absorbe the Obelisk an its ealy powers . But why hurt a waitress ? - I on 't think it was intentional . - You 're saying he 's losing control ? He ha some control issues when S.H.I.E.L .. first came across him . If that 's what 's happening , anyone near him is at risk . I shoul have engage when I ha the chance . Then you ' be ea , too . If this is on anyone ... Just because you 're irector , oesn 't mean - everything 's on you , Phil . - Yes . It oes . Go ark . Get back when you can . Now what ? Nice rie . Some rich guy loan it to you ? Yeah , something like that . - Shame about the rims , though , eh ? - Yeah . Probably cost a gran each . - At least . - Mm . - This isn 't a frienly stop , is it ? - Nope . Hans on the car . How the hell i you lose him ? ! Why haven 't you got every agent out there looking for Creel right now ? ! You think you 're entitle to answers ? He kille two of my friens . I think that 's entitlement enough . - Well , it 's not . - You shoul have aborte the mission . Hartley shoul have followe my orers . Yeah , well , she trie to . Izzy 's only mistake was listening to me . Is that why you came back ? Guilt ? A esire for revenge ? Or was it because of what Talbot promise you ? All of the above . - So you took the eal . - I have 48 hours to eliver you . Or else you 're a ea man . - Wors to that effect , yeah . - Talbot . An you in 't give him our location ? on 't get me wrong . I thought about it . He put a four-man etail on me . Took three hours to shake them . I coul have le them right to your oor . So kin of you to reconsier . An in exchange for me , you get what , exactly ? A proper burial for Isabelle Hartley . I wante to make sure her recor was cleare , that her family were properly notifie . - Really ? That 's all ? - Look , between you an Talbot , I know you 'll get to Creel first . He 's the only thing I want . Well , that an the money you owe me . You 're kiing , right ? 'Cause sometimes I can 't tell . No , I 'm not . I want my pay , an not just mine , either . I want Hartley 's an laho 's , too . - Okay . Now you 're kiing . - It 's for their families . I think they eserve something for their loss. on 't you think ? - I 'll take care of it . - Goo . Once we have Creel ... I 'll be in the win . Or three sheets to it . Fitz : Why are they going the biochemical route ? Using an aenovirus factor to counter Creel 's ability . Yeah , well , it 's pointless , really , since the injecte , um ... Injecte vector will never bin to his cellular membranes . Yeah , so ... well , then they have to fin a way to estabilize ... The molecular structure of Creel 's epiermal cells , yeah . - estabilize . - Oh . I ... I in 't solve this toay . Who you talking to ? - Me . - What ? No one . You like talking to yourself . That 's cool . A lot of people o . You know , I like singing in the shower . Yeah , I know it 's not really the same thing , but I wouln 't want anyone to hear it . - What o you want ? - All right , for cloaking , were you thinking about putting it uner avionics or ... ? Enough about cloaking ! I 'm busy ... with ... something . Well , it souns like you 're just blowing me off . You want to be alone ? That 's cool . You know , I think I like him . - He 's honest . - Blunt , I ' say . I call them like I see them . No , he oesn 't talk to you like the others . - It 's quite refreshing , actually . - Yo . Fitz . - Your min go wanering again ? - What ? - See ? - No . What o you got there ? - No ... this ... this is just , uh ... - Go ahea an show him . What harm woul it o ? oes it have something to o with stopping Creel ? Yeah . I think ... I think that we are ... I-I ... have ... I ... - I in 't solve this toay . - You think you can ? Izzy 's sister , Jane . Her favorite person in the worl . After me , of course . Looks like they like each other . Yeah , those two , when they got together , there was a lot of laughs . An bottles of wine . Izzy was goo when it came to family . Which is why I 'm taking this . It belonge to her mum . ie of breast cancer about five years back . - Jane has it now , too . - That 's awful . Yeah . Life can be a mean runk that way . Never knows when to stop punching . How i you guys meet ? - Through my psychotic ex-wife . - Mm-hmm . Those two were goo friens back in the ay . I 'm really sorry . Tough to lose people you care about . Secret to that ? on 't get attache . Trie that . in 't work . For you , either . You know , you remin me a bit of Izzy . Raw but sharp . You got skills . - Mm . - Type that coul earn you some real money in the private sector . As a mercenary ? Yeah , I on 't think so . We prefer the term " private military contractors . " on 't knock it . Everyone nees an exit strategy eventually . Not me . S.H.I.E.L .. ' s my life now . S.H.I.E.L .. isn 't a life . It 's just a job ... a means to an en . Remember that . You hear anything more about Creel , let me know . Who 's this ? Bakshi : Goo evening , Mr. Creel . We 've been trying to reach you . Where the hell were you ? I waite at the rop site for an hour . Calm own , Mr. Creel . There 's no nee to panic . We 're being cautious now that S.H.I.E.L .. is a factor . Forget them . I got a real problem . That thing really messe me up . I turne to rubber when I touche it . Thought that it woul protect me , but it infecte me , too . We 're well aware of your conition . But believe me when I say that Mr. Whitehall wouln 't have selecte you for this job if you weren 't capable of completing it . You on 't know what it 's oing to me . I can 't keep it off . Once we have the Obelisk , you will be taken care of the way Hyra has always taken care of you . Please procee to the seconary rop site , an I shall meet you at the appropriate time . Goo night . Hello ? ! What ? ! What are you looking at ? ! Leave them alone , Mr. Creel . We have far more important things to iscuss . - I know you from somewhere ? - My name is Raina , an I 'm a huge amirer of yours ... an your gifts . Beat it , lay . I 'm not into groupies . You misunerstan . I know you recently acquire something extremely precious an rare ... something I 'm very intereste in . Whatever you 're offering ... it ain 't enough . Maybe not . But aren 't you the least bit curious as to what it might be ? It 's calle carbyne , an allotrope of carbon foun in starust , three times harer than iamon ... With an ae bonus . It can store energy . Beautiful , isn 't it ? So fille with potential . - Am I suppose to be impresse ? - I 'll settle for intereste . You have no iea who you 're ealing with , lay . - You ever hear of Hyra ? - Name rings a bell . Let me give you a tip ... run . 'Cause if the guy I 'm working for gets ahol of you , I ' hate to see what he 's gonna o to that pretty little face of yours . Looks like you nee some help there , Mr. Creel . I 'm not the one who nees help , lay . You o if you touche the Obelisk . I 'll tell you what ... I 'm gonna o you a soli an not tell my boss about you ! - What about the carbyne ? - It 's the cost of oing business . May : He couln 't have gone far . Local authorities have his escription . Roablocks are up . Talbot 's people are still out there . - Why was Creel at the bar ? - He was waiting for someone . We just on 't know if that person ever showe . We nee a solve for Creel 's powers . An we nee it yesteray . - How 's the lab coming ? - Nothing yet . You remember that encrypte Hyra frequency we shut own ? - Well , it 's back up . - Someone sent a message . A message for us with a phone number to call . Yeah , coul be Creel . Creel ? A phone number ? What , is he lonely ? I oubt it . The guy is jacke . An he can turn any boy part into any material . - Okay . Thank you for that . - Mm-hmm . Yeah . - Call the number . - Okay . - Raina : Hello ? - Who is this ? Agent Coulson , I 'm gla you got my message . Raina , as I live an breathe . It 's been a while since we 've spoken . I 'm kin of in the mile of a manhunt . Can we make this quick ? Why ? You nee time to trace this call , on 't you ? I take it , then , you haven 't tracke own Mr. Creel or the item he stole . What o you know about that ? I know Hyra 's about to get their hans on it . - Well , congratulations . - Let me be clear . Mr. Creel is working for Hyra . I am not . Why the breakup ? Ba ental plan ? Hyra only has one thing on their mins ... worl omination ... - which is so 1945 . - What o you want , Raina ? It 's what I on 't want , which is the Obelisk falling into the hans of people who on 't unerstan it . I 'm thinking you might . An I 'm thinking you 're gonna tell me why . John Garrett unerstoo it . The moment he was injecte with the same rug that save you , he ha visions . He starte carving those visions on the walls . Garrett was a maman . Garrett was enlightene . He witnesse our fate ... what we ' become . - Have you ? - You 're not calling to talk about fate . You want us to catch Creel . You rea my min , Agent Coulson . Truth is Mr. Creel stole something from me . Fortunately for the both of us , it has an embee tracker . But you ' better hurry . He 's growing less stable by the secon . Moment that tracker 's frequency comes through , I want everyone on the move . If Creel 's haning off the item to Hyra , we nee to see where that leas . What if Creel melts own again ? The lab hasn 't figure out how to shut own his powers yet . If he 's an immeiate threat to civilians , - Trip 's got the backup plan . - What kin of backup plan ? The heavy-uty kin with armor-piercing rouns . Will that work ? Get close enough to him , catch him off guar ... Hopefully , we won 't have to fin out . Where o you want me ? That epens . Can you follow an orer ? Absolutely , sir . Because part of me wants you here running back-en . The other part knows we nee boots on the groun , an I 've only got a few goo pairs . I 'll be goo . Scout 's honor . Please , sir . I owe Hartley one . - We coul use him . - Suit up . It 's all about the ... the resonant . I in 't solve this toay . What ... what ... what ... what is this ? What , is this some kin of sonic thing , - like the cloaking evice ? - No , I in 't , uh ... Look , forget about the cloaking evice , all right ? No one 's blaming you for that . Right now we just got to focus on taking own Creel . Whoa ! Whoa ! Calm the hell own ! Hey , beat it ! You 're pissing him off . - Okay . - Take it easy . - Look , I in 't solve this toay ! - Yeah , I know . You sai that alreay ! I in 't solve this toay ! Wait . Are you saying you in 't solve this toay . - You solve this before ? - Yes . Y-you 're looking for an ol esign ? - Yes ! Yeah . Yeah . - All right . Okay . All right . I 'm with you . - Yeah . - I 'm with you , turbo . All right . No . No . No . Um ... go back one . Go back one . Yeah . Yeah ! Icers ? Great . How i we get stuck with a nonlethal option ? Coin flip . Trip calle tails . Just getting wor from the lab . Fitz might have something we can use to neutralize Creel 's powers . Best news we 've ha all ay . Raina 's tracker just poppe . Creel 's here . Trip , are you in position ? Locke , loae , an looking ... Foun him . He 's got the package . Looks like Creel is talking to the guy with his back to him . That 's his Hyra contact . The eal 's going own . Skye ? Running facial recognition now . Let 's put a name to that face . Let the exchange happen . Skye an Hunter , follow the new player . May , stay with Creel . Everyone copy ? - Copy that . - Copy . Copy that , sir . The package is still in place . Woner why Creel hasn 't mae the exchange yet . Can we get a laser mike on him ? Skye , you copy ? Skye ? Oh , hell no . You 're not listening . It 's spreaing all over . I can barely contain it . Pass me the case an I 'll help you . Help me , an I won 't o to you what I i to the waitress . Calm own , Mr. Creel . Take a eep breath an clear your min . Remember your training . Remember , compliance will be reware . - I 'm happy to comply . - Goo . Very goo . - Whoa ! - Man : He 's got a gun ! Oh , my go ! Everyboy out ! Move ! I 'm not gonna sugarcoat it , pal . This is really gonna hurt . Coulson : " Scout 's honor " ? You were never a boy scout , were you ? Solier : Present ! Huh ! Orer ! Huh ! Breaking into cars now ? Following up on a promise . Thanks to you . General Talbot 's not the only one with friens , Though I am sorry about that $ 2 million you wante . - That I can 't swing . - Oh , you knew about that , too , eh ? I 'm the irector of S.H.I.E.L .. Well , that 's just marvelous . Talbot wants me ea . An now I have no funs to run with . - Any tips ? - Yeah . on 't run . Work for me instea . Creel must have hit you in the hea . I shot three of your agents . Incluing Agent May . Not a smart move . - She the type that hols a gruge ? - Savors it , actually . No oubt , you 've mae some mistakes . So have I , like letting you go after Creel . - But I felt for you . - Yeah , an I took avantage of that . How o you know I won 't o it again ? I on 't , but the reality is I on 't have a fleet of helicarriers or quinjets or thousans of agents at my isposal anymore . We 're lucky we still have our George Foreman grill . You nee warm boies . Is that it ? I nee skille assets in the fiel who are willing to step over the line , to o the wrong thing but for the right reason . I nee you because I can 't be you . Not anymore . Yeah , well , you 're better off . Trust me . Look , it 's your choice . But goo people ... people I respect ... vouche for you . - I ' like to fin out why . - Hell if I know . - But I 'm curious . - Goo enough . Oh . I just nee you to o one thing . - Oh , yeah ? - Sell me out . The soun waves isrupte the molecular , um ... The molecular ... the , um ... Well , you shoul unerstan . You moifie it . You know how some guys can play a tune by ear ? Well , I nee sheet music . The original one ... you built this with this Agent Simmons - I keep hearing about ? - Yeah . What about Simmons ? Oh , no , no . I hear that she was cool . Hear that you two were pretty tight . Yeah . It 's tough to lose a goo partner . How you been holing up since she left ? I 'm okay . I 'm gla he 's talking to someone . I 've got to amit , I 'm having a tough time with it . May : It 's unerstanable . He 's change . We all have . Even the irector . Coulson has a lot on his plate , rebuiling S.H.I.E.L .. I wouln 't know . He 's not exactly the sharing type these ays . He has the worl to worry about , not just us , not just the team . That 's not it , May . I 've been watching him for months , an I know he 's keeping something from me , an it 's not just because he 's the irector of S.H.I.E.L .. I think something is wrong with him . - Skye ... - No , May , be honest . - Is Coulson okay ? - Of course . May : What is wrong with you ? You 're irector now , not some level 1 fiel agent . There are no levels anymore . I got ri of those . You never shoul have gone into the fiel like that . - You 're welcome . - It 's not funny , Phil . I know you . An I know when you 're overly stresse . It 's been 18 ays since your last episoe . - 17 . - 18 . Which means you 're ue or another one . Overue . - An I 'm tire of fighting it . - So on 't . That 's why I 'm here . You i well . - Thank you . I ... - Now ... pick it up . You ... You want me ... I nee to know . So o you . Pick it up . - It worke . - No . It let you live . There 's a ifference . Show me . Please . Bring me my aughter , an I 'll show the both of you . Coulson : We 'll return in a moment . Glenn . - Can I call you " Glenn " ? - No . - Where 's Hunter ? - Watching " Cake Boss , " I believe . Sorry . I change the terms of your eal . Well , he kept up his en . - You 're here . Question is why ? - I felt ba for kinapping you , so I brought you a peace offering . Carl Creel . I thought Creel was ea . He 's turne to stone , but he coul always o that , so I 'm not sure how long it 'll hol . I 've got him in a cryostasis chamber in the back of the van for 58 more minutes before the juice runs out . I ' get him someplace secure pretty quick . Maybe a little more secure than last time . - Just saying . - Very generous of you . Like I tol you before , general , we 're the goo guys . So , how about we make a eal ? S.H.I.E.L .. will keep ropping off presents like this , you keep getting promote . All we ask for in return is a little breathing room . - Soun goo ? - You ... You must have some big brass ones , Coulson . Coming out here by yourself to meet me ... face-to-face , no backup . Let 's face facts . You an your little ban of misfits are harly S.H.I.E.L .. Our intel says you on 't have enough manpower or artillery to take own a convenience store , so I 'm sorry . - I 'm gonna have to say no to that eal . - I on 't know . I think we 're goo on artillery . An in case you get any ieas , general ... that 's just the tip of the iceberg . Let 's get out of here before the iceberg runs out of fuel .

 [ Waves lapping ] [ Helicopter ] Colonel Chadwick sent me ! We got a Code Orange ! We got a big storm coming in ! I got a problem in the pump room ! Let 's go . Yeah , so sounds like you got a punch-through . We 've hit a geologic formation . Gas ? Something else . What ? Like a structural trap ? Take a look . You tell me . Hey . What you got ? Travis , look at this . We tapped into some rocky sediment . It 's causing real damage . This is volcanic material . Nothing in our geologic survey shows this . [ Gas hissing ] methane ! Hey , methane ! Bill ! Bill ! [ Alarm sounding ] Bill ! Bill ! Bill ! Buddy , can you hear me ? Can you hear me , huh ? Hey , is he breathing ? No , no ! All right , start the CPR ! All right , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ... Come on , Bill . Live bit ! Let 's go ! [ Gasping ] We got a kicker ! There 's a plume outside the radius ! We don 't have much time ! Hold her ! Hold her steady ! We 're under-balanced ! [ Gurgling ] Clegg : I 'll throw the chain ! Go ! Careful , uncle ! Whoa ! Aah ! Hey ! [ Screaming ] Uncle Clegg ! Uncle Clegg , you okay ? What just happened ? I think we just spiked a volcano . [ Thunder ] [ Thunder ] [ Thunder ] Mr. Winters , it 's Colonel Chadwick . Listen , I know Petro-Cal sent Travis Verdon out to your rig . Yes , sir . This storm is building too fast for my comfort . It 's gonna impact your rig in less than an hour . Now , I have a NOAA vessel in the area . I 'd very much like my science team to come and check it out . Your liaison is Dr. Jenna Sparks . Please see that she 's well looked after . Of course , sir . We will offer her every accommodation possible . Thank you , Winters . Look , I know it 's not easy having me looking over your shoulder . Just try to remember we 're all on the same side here . Thank you , sir . This must be a hell of a storm if sending the big boss in isn 't enough . What do you mean ? Well , Chadwick wants to send in a specialist group from NOAA . That 's bigger than normal . Yeah . I guess we 'll see . [ Thunder ] You know , the nano-material is showing real promise breaking up extreme storm patterns . Yeah , and this , uh , silver iodide research , too . It 's gonna play a major role in preventing catastrophic storms . You know what I 'm picturing ? Huh ? Cover of science news . [ Laughs ] Oh , I can see the headline already . " The Storm Killers . " [ Both laughing ] [ Cell phone rings ] [ Rings ] Hello , Colonel . Dr. Sparks , my intel is showing me that the landsat readings for the Wilforce-3 are off the charts . Uh , yeah , we 're pretty close by her . Would you like us to do a physical recon ? Chadwick : I would . Also , if there 's any malfunction or even any new information , I 'd very much like to have you report back to me as soon as possible . And , Dr. Sparks , the California coastline is a natural treasure . I 'll be damned if Petro-Cal takes a dump on my beaches . Yes , Colonel . Colonel Chadwick wants us to stop by Wilforce-3 , check it out . He says the temperature is rising way too quickly on that rig . I hope we can get our sniffers down there before this storm moves in . Yeah , me , too . Colonel Chadwick already has his hands full with the storm preparation . Yeah , he sure doesn 't need an offshore complication . Nope . I 'll check it out . All right . Captain Worley , on walkie-talkie : Dr. Sparks ? Yes , uh , Captain Worley , we need to change course for Wilforce-3 . We 've got to turn back now ! I do not like the looks of these skies ! I don 't like it , either , but we have our orders . Yeah , well , I 've been navigating these waters for 20 years , and I never seen nothin ' look like this . [ Thunder ] [ Ship creaks ] Captain Worley ? It 's closing fast ! Prepare below ! Captain Worley ! Rough seas ahead ! Go ! [ Crew speaking excitedly ] Secure the hatches ! Get below ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! She 's on her beam ends ! [ Shouting ] Man overboard ! Man overboard ! [ Vent flares ] [ Thunder ] Winters , can you hear me ? What 's happening ? Where are you ? Blowout . Are there any wounded ? Joe and Paul were killed in the blast . Clegg is injured . Winters : Travis , you got to get out of there now . [ Alarm sounding ] [ Groans ] Travis , get out of there now ! We got a punch-through with methane . Joe Paul and Bill Saunders were killed . Clegg ? He 's wounded . I don 't know his condition . Are we out of alignment ? We got 25 at zero and 50 at 100,000 psi . That 's enough pressure to cut through diamonds . We got to enact the blowout preventer . It 'll take some time to disconnect from a mile of pipeline . That storm 's gonna be here in less than an hour . How long do you need ? It 'll be close . And in the meantime , we 're dumping drilling fluid in methane ? Okay . Okay , reroute the fluids and put an end to that methane leak . I don 't want any more men killed . Yes , sir . [ Groans ] Secure the equipment ! What 's your reading ? Well , the temperature differential shot from 65 to 129 in a couple of hours . They must have broken into molten lava . Yeah , if my reading 's correct , that thing 's a volcano . [ Thunder ] [ Hatch slams open ] Unh ! Wilforce-3 is in serious trouble . They need to know what they 're sitting on . Sea rover to Wilforce-3 , come in please ! [ Static ] Wilforce-3 , come in ! Radio operator : Wilforce-3 to Sea Rover . State your communication . This is Dr. Jenna Sparks . I 'm a research meteorologist investigating the atmospheric condition around the rig . I need to speak with your manager immediately ! Radio operator : let me connect you to rig manager Winters . Operator ? [ Static ] Wilforce-3 , come in please . [ Clegg groaning ] Wilforce-3 , please , come in ! [ Static ] [ Thud ] Unh ! What 's happening down there ? We hit some kind of molten deposit . I 'm worried about the stability of this rig . Can you move ? Yeah . Yeah , all right , all right . Listen , listen . The generator turbines are still on . I know . That methane is still leaking . It should deactivate automatically . No , the electricians are troubleshooting . They turned off auto shutdown . I know , but you got to move a little faster . Can you ? 'Cause if that methane catches a spark , we 're like toast . Come on . All right . All right , let 's go . [ Groans ] There she is . Warm water , moist air . It 's the devil 's playground . It 's massive . We 've , uh , got less than half an hour to reach that rig . We got to go now ! [ Engines whining ] Come on , come on , come on . Lean on me . The generators . This way . Just a little further . The smell , the smell . We 're almost there . Come on , come on ! [ Explosion ] Uncle ... Uncle Clegg ! Uncle Clegg ! Are you okay ? Hey , can you hear me ? Come on . Come on , get up , get up . Get up . [ Explosion ] Aah ! What was that ? I don 't know ! [ Grunts ] Rotor stall ! Going into a nosedive ! Pull up ! [ Both straining ] Turbulence ! Come on ! Come on ! We need to pull up ! Almost ! [ Grunts ] Almost got it ! [ Relieved sigh ] All right , nice flying . We 've lost our generators . We 're on fire . We got to evacuate now before that storm comes in . Yes , sir . Mobilize the lifeboats , prepare for evacuation . This man needs help now ! All right , I 'm a medic . We 'll get him to the chopper . What happened to your friend ? He 's my uncle . It was an accident in the pump room . Well , Dr. Cavanaugh will take good care of him . I 'm Dr. Jenna Sparks from the NOAA . I need to speak to your rig manager now . Follow me ! [ Thunder ] [ Alarm blaring ] I 'm Travis Verdon . I 'm here at request of Colonel Chadwick . It 's been pretty bad out here today . What happened ? We hit a pocket of molten lava . The heat from that rupture is creating an event . What kind of event ? The water is superheating making the surrounding air highly unstable . What does this mean to the rig ? Can you handle a storm with the power of five katrinas ? 1,000 miles per hour winds ? I mean , how can that be ? We 're not in the tropics . The warm water is creating cyclone conditions . It 's changing everything we know about the weather . Travis . Rowell : What happened in the pump room ? Joe and Bill were killed in the blast . My uncle was badly wounded . I got him prepped for evac . I 'm sorry to hear that . What exactly happened in there ? We hit a pocket of magma , a lava blast that came up through the bore hole . Mr. Winters , Colonel Chadwick sent me to investigate . I 'm an atmospheric specialist . The warm water is creating the first cyclone in California . A cyclone ? It 's going to unleash a chain of events that 's going to threaten the entire West Coast . What kind of events ? It 's going to be a storm like you 've never seen before . It 's what we call a super cyclone . Sir , I got over 100 company men on this rig . This storm will impact this rig in a matter of minutes . Evacuate all non-essential personnel immediately . I don 't want anyone left on this rig other than the hazard team . I 'm on it . Travis , we got to get your uncle out of here . He 's in good hands . I 'm staying . What do you need me to do to help ? Travis , I know that you 're here to help , but I am still the safety officer on this rig . Now , this is my call . I am ordering you to leave . Listen , I 'm a structural engineer , Gary . Let me help you . That 's exactly why . I can 't think of anyone better to coordinate the crisis effort . Now , Colonel Chadwick is a soldier , not an oil man . Believe me , you 'd do much better for me off this rig than on it . Understood . I got your back . Well , if we 're gonna get off this rig , we need to go now . Okay . How is he ? I had to put a tourniquet on his leg to stop the bleeding . Can 't feel my leg . I can do more for him back at the Sea Rover . Don 't let me lose my leg ! You 're in good hands . You 're gonna be all right , uncle . Hang in there . Come on , let 's go . Oh , no . [ Thunder ] We 're on the leading edge of the storm . We 're all set back here . Okay , hang on tight . [ Engines whining ] Sparks , if you are not here in five minutes , I am leavin ' ! I have lost crew , and I swear to god , I am not gonna lose any more . Do you hear me ? Worley , don 't go anywhere ! We 're on our way ! [ Thunder ] [ Gasping and straining ] Come on . I 'll meet you on the nav bridge . All right . Hey , Worley , we got a wounded man here . I 'll need to stitch him up . Take him to the galley . Use the big steel counter . Make it quick . Come on , come on ! All right , here we go . Easy . All right , get him up on the table there . Feet down at the end . Get up here . Get some towels here . Watch your head there , buddy . Okay . You okay ? Oh , the rig . I 'm gonna wash up and grab my bag . Okay . The rig ? I know . I tried to stay , but Gary ordered me off . They 're my family . I spent my whole life on the rig , my whole life . I know , I know . I promise you , I 'm gonna get the men out . I promise you that , uncle . Look at me . Look at me--filthy . My whole life , my whole life ... Dirty- - dirty , dangerous job , huh ? You ... Hey . College ... clean shirt , right ? Clean shirt . Aw , I 'm so proud of you . I 'm proud of you . Thanks , uncle Clegg . I 'm proud of you . You 're gonna be all right . Hey , anything I can do ? Yeah , uh , Travis , um , tell you what , why don 't you wait up on the nav bridge , okay ? Okay , all right . You gonna be all right ? Yeah , sure . I 'm right out here , all right ? Right , right . I 'll take good care of him , don 't worry . Travis : All right . [ Thunder ] Can 't we go any faster ? No , we missed our chance to move fast . Now it 's a chess game . You see them big waves out there ? The worse thing can happen is we start to run down the face of one of them big ones . Are they gonna swamp us ? Hell , no , not if I can help it . [ Wind howling ] How 's your uncle ? Doctor C 's still working on him . Where 's the storm ? I 'm sorry , Travis . The storm 's hitting Wilforce-3 right now . What ? Scramble the rescue nets ! Do you see him ? Get the ladders now ! Over there ! Over there ! Winters : Activate the transmitters ! Man overboard ! [ Water boiling ] Aah ! Man overboard ! Samuels , pull ! Quick turn ! Quick turn ! [ Men screaming ] There 's the strobe ! [ Screaming ] Help ! [ Screaming ] No ! No ! Starboard side , now ! [ Men shouting ] The lifeboats are failing . Pull back ! Abandon the lifeboats ! Come back ! God ! No ! [ Screaming ] God , they 're boiling alive . Bring them back ! Stop the evac ! Stop the evac ! It 's a bloodbath out there ! Where are the rescue helicopters ? Even if they got the distress call , the storm 's gotten too bad . The only thing we can do now is try to plug the punch-through . Okay , okay , shunt the spacers and bypass the pressure gauges . That 's our only warning system ! We 've got no choice ! [ Thunder ] [ Wind howling ] Oh . Here you go , buddy . Hey , doc , how 's my uncle doing ? Well , I stitched him up . I did the best I could . Will he get to keep his leg ? I 'll be happier when we get him to a hospital . Oh , man , I have never seen anything like this . I got to get those men off that rig . We 're racing ahead of the storm , but it 's gonna hit landfall at point conception in less than an hour . Here she comes ! Brace yourselves ! Oh ! [ Grunts ] [ Groans ] Oh ! We 're breaking free . This storm , it 's moving way too fast . [ Thunder ] Did that oil rig cause this whole damn thing ? There 's a super cyclone coming . Millions of people are gonna die . We 're headed south . We broke free . Well , that 's temporary . It 's only a matter of hours before it slams greater Los Angeles . Reporter : The national weather service has issued a severe Pacific storm warning . Prepare for damaging winds , storm surges , and flash flooding . There 's no way for them to prepare for a storm of this size . We 've got to stop it . [ Thunder ] We 're just ahead of her . Not for long . It 's gonna be on us in about two hours . Right up there . There 's the Marina . We may be able to use my nanotechnology research to stop the storm . [ Fire dispatcher speaking on radio ] Cavanaugh : Get this man to a hospital ! Hey , you okay , uncle , huh ? Go , go . I 'm not gonna leave you . The best thing you can do for me is get our brothers off that rig . I want to make sure you 're gonna be okay . If not you , then who ? All right . You hang in there , you hear me ? You , too . All right . All right , go ahead . Thanks for saving my life , doc . Hey , I expect to see you walking on that next time I see you , all right ? Let 's get off this boat . We got to get moving . [ Thunder ] [ Computers beeping ] I can 't reach the Petro-Cal headquarters . All communication and data lines are out . I 'm sorry , Travis , but the Wilforce-3 , it 's in the eye of the storm now . Look , I got to help the men on the rig . Travis , listen to me , listen to me . The leading edge of the super cyclone has already made landfall at point conception . It 's taken out power grids , communication capabilities , transportation arteries . And , I mean , that 's just the tip of the iceberg . I mean , once the full force of this storm hits the major population centers ... . Look , you have to take me back . Do you understand ? No , you don 't understand ! Okay , the last time I spoke with Colonel Chadwick , he still thinks that he can move these people out of danger . Colonel Chadwick is the one that sent me to the Wilforce-3 . I should be there ! No , Travis ! Camp Pendleton is the main command center for this disaster . They 're gonna need all our expertise in order to deal with this super cyclone . Jenna 's right . We have to work together . Look , if we stop this storm , then we can save the coast and your men on Wilforce-3 . Okay . All right , let 's go then , all right ? Come on . Okay . We 've got to stay ahead of the road closures . Well , the last thing I saw before the TV went out is that they 're only closing down the beach cities . Well , that 's not enough . I mean , the current emergency plan does not take into account a storm of this size traveling so far inland . And that 's feeding warm water from a super volcano . Reporter : Doppler radar indicates the storm is capable of producing large hail , breaking windows , and damaging houses . Severe storm warnings remain in effect for the following counties : Los Angeles , Ventura , Santa Barbara , Orange , and San Diego . The oil ! Let 's go ! Wilforce-3 to coast guard command , do you copy ? Try another channel . Mayday ! Mayday ! This is the Wilforce-3 deepwater drill rig ! Do you copy ? Channel 13 , 14 , and 15 are all dead . Try channel 16 . Mayday ! We are in need of immediate assistance ! There 's nothing , sir ! It 's complete white noise ! Alex , get me something ! We 're completely isolated ! Aah ! Well , I 've been running some calculations , and I think we might be able to do something with your silver iodide nano-flakes . Yeah ? Well , my first priority is to get the rescue effort underway . Yeah , well , the Wilforce-3 is key to this whole solution . You were there . Yeah , I never seen anything like it . You know , we 've been talking for years about climate change . We just didn 't think it would happen this fast . Well , it looks like in less than an hour , southern California 's gonna be hit with this super cyclone . This is an apocalyptic weather event that 's happening right now . Hey , look out ! Look out ! Yeah , that way , that way ! I can 't see a thing ! The wind , it 's kicking up mud . Uh , I don 't think that 's mud . That 's oil . The updrafts must be lifting this fluid from the Wilforce-3 . Here it comes ! [ Tires screeching ] There , there , there ! Turn down--Turn down on that little road ! I can 't ! It 's too slippery ! Travis ! We 're heading for it ! We 're in it ! All right , hold on ! Aah ! Oh , man ! [ Groans ] Hold onto something ! Aah ! Aah ! Oh , my god . [ Wind blowing ] [ Other sounds stop ] [ Sound of wipers in slow motion ] [ Thud ] [ Coughs ] Aah ! Oh ! Ah ! Oh ! Hey , Dr. Cav , you all right ? Yeah , I banged up my knees pretty good , but I think I 'm all right . What happened ? Cavanaugh : We were lifted in a rotating wall . Travis : I never heard of tornadoes in California . It 's the super cyclone . It 's creating a low pressure area . It 's perfect for funnel clouds . Where are we ? [ Beep ] Oh , man , my GPS is out . I got no bars . You got any reception there ? Nope . You know , we got to get going . That super cyclone 's gonna hit the coast any minute . Yeah , come on . Reporter : Reporting damaging winds in excess of 200 miles per hour . Stay away from the coastline . A severe storm warning is in effect . Locations impacted include all beach cities . I don 't understand . It seems fine now . Are we in the eye ? No , it 's the ring of convection . It 's what caused the upward vertical movement of air that lifted the suv . We don 't have much time . Yeah , the sooner we get out of the open , the better . Yeah , let 's go . Where are we ? No idea , but it looks like ... . Look . [ Thunder ] That 's Catumbo lightning here in California ? Wait a minute . The super cyclone is building up a huge electrical charge . Whoa , that 's getting pretty close . Yeah . Hey , there 's shelter . Come on . Yeah , come on , let 's go , let 's go ! Reporter : In addition to large hail and damaging winds , continuous cloud-to-ground lightning is occurring with this storm . Move indoors immediately . If you can hear the thunder , you are close enough to be struck by lightning . Advancing storm is impacting roads , homes , and other vital infrastructure . Yeah , well , the storm blew us further away from Camp Pendleton . Yeah , better keep moving then . Yeah , we need to find a low profile heavy vehicle . That 's not exactly low profile , but it 's close . Yeah . It 'll have to do . Yep . Check this out . Wonder if anyone 's in here . Hello ! Hello ? See what I can find . Anybody home ? Hello , there ! Hello ? Hey ! Get away from my truck ! Wait ! Looters ! We 're not looters ! We 're not looters . We 're with the government . Same thing ! Now get off of my property ! We can 't do that , sir . Oh , yes , you can . Now get gone ! Aah ! [ Shouting ] Hey , hey , let go ! Hey , hey , calm down , sir . We 're the solution here . Who the hell do you think you are ? Tell him . Uh , we 're , uh ... We 're with the NOAA , sir . That 's right . Yeah . We need to borrow your truck . National Oceanic and Atmospherical Association ? What the hell ? Hey , got the keys ! All right , start it . Look , we 're sorry . We need to take your truck , okay ? Just call that number and file a claim . Call the number , okay ? Come on , we need to move ! And thanks for the truck . You 're not welcome ! Jenna : Sorry . And leave me my gun ! Okay , have a good day . What 's the sit rep , Sergeant Major ? Sir , Fema is requesting assistance from Camp Pendleton . What do they need ? To use the base as a staging area for trucks and generators . Anything else ? They need men for sandbagging . Send bravo company out to sandbag and let transport know that we 're expecting company . Yes , sir . Mayday ! Mayday ! This is the Wilforce-3 command . Come in ! Come in ! Wilforce-3 ! What 's the status ? Hose teams are working . I 've got every available man spraying sea water on that fire . Foam plug didn 't work . Lava 's still moving . [ Rig creaking ] It 's the struts . We 're listing . Alex , check the ballast . It 's not safe yet . With a destabilized floor , the fire-retardant foam and sea water are tipping the whole rig . If we stop to rebalance the pontoons , the fire 's gonna get out of control . What are we gonna do ? We 're gonna do the same thing we 're doing already . We 're gonna walk a very fine line between burning down and destabilizing . How 's the radio ? I can 't reach anybody . It 's like we 're in some kind of a dead zone . Well , it 's like Dr. Jenna said . The temperature differentials must be off the scale . So the punch-through is causing the storm . And we 're in the middle . Wilforce-3 is in the eye of the storm . [ Laughing ] You saved our ass back there ! Man , you 're prepared for anything ! What , were you a scout ? Are you kidding ? I 'm about as far away from a boy scout as they are . How 'd you learn to handle a gun like that ? I wasn 't always this dashing , heroic engineer , you know . [ Laughs ] The closer we get to the coast , the worse this is gonna get . [ Thunder ] How much time do you think we have before the full force of this storm hits the l.A. Basin ? Well , based on the 72-hour value for wind plus forward motion , less than two hours . Well , if we 're gonna have any hope of stopping this storm , we 're gonna have to make our move before it gets too powerful to overcome . How do we do that , huh ? Well , it 's hard to say for sure since nothing like this has ever been attempted . What are you thinking , doc ? Well , I got the idea when I saw that voltaic arc form . From the lightning strike ? Yes , and your nano-materials research . Now , if we can deliver a payload of silver iodide nano-flakes into the eye of the storm ... Ah , and use the electrical energy of the storm itself . It 'll generate a controlled lightning strike to disrupt the spinning vortex . Exactly , and weaken the eye wall of the super cyclone . Huh . Do you think it 'll work ? Well , you know , this science is based on a very old a weather control technique , cloud seeding . Yeah , what about the rig ? How can we save it ? Well , that 's where Colonel Chadwick comes in . [ Thunder ] [ People screaming ] Guardsmen have been deployed to sandbag . Fema trucks are running around the clock . Very good , Sergeant Major . Ahem . What is it , Miss Peters ? I 'm concerned about a report from Commander Grady . He said that there 's trouble with the Wilforce-3 . What kind of trouble ? They 're on top of a volcano , sir . They 're mobilizing a Hamilton class cutter , But there 's no way they 'll get there tonight . We may have to clean up . Those rigs can handle the apocalypse . We need to focus on the civilian effort . Yes , sir . Reporter : Marine Corps personnel are making preparations for the storm impact . Secure all loose debris and equipment . Move immediately to an interior room of your house or business . Catastrophic winds will make landfall inside Southern California population centers within the hour . We 're capsizing ! Correct the dynamic positioning . The ballast control operator 's dead . Can you do it ? In a simulator years ago . I got 240 tons of sea water on the forward support column ! If I flood the wrong one , the rig goes down . We all die . Alex , we 're capsizing ! You 've got to ! Give me a minute ! I don 't have a minute ! Which chamber ? We 're at 10 degree tilt . We 're gonna flip . Alex , you can do this . [ Beeping ] I 'm releasing the chain locker now . Dumping . [ Beeping ] Dumping . We 're stabilizing . You did it . You did it . [ Laughs ] The methane ! Firefighters ! Retreat ! All hands pull back now ! Retreat , retreat ! [ Explosion ] Sir , I 've gotten some strange images from NASA . What is that ? The sky appears to be on fire , sir . The phenomenon is heading inland now . We expect landfall within the hour . Where 's my damn science advisor ? Dr. Jenna Sparks ? Get her on the phone ! Maybe she can explain to us why today 's the day that the world chose to end ! Yes , sir . Hail ! Look out , look out ! Go , go . Drive as fast as you can . Maybe we can get past it . [ Sirens ] [ Screaming ] [ Sirens ] [ Fire trucks honking horns ] Look at that ! [ Tires screeching ] The truck 's on fire ! Put it out ! What ? Put it out ! Go ! Get us out of here ! I 'm closing the vents . Stop the truck ! [ Coughing ] The car 's on fire ! The car is on fire ! Stop the truck ! Everything 's on fire ! Hey ! I found a little fire extinguisher back here . There you go . Aah . Cavanaugh : Careful , careful ! Jenna : Aah ! Ah , jeez . [ Cell phone rings ] [ Fire extinguisher discharging ] [ Rings ] Hello ! Hello ! Dr. Sparks , can you hear us ? Dr. Sparks ? [ Static ] I had it for a second , but now it 's dead . Dr. Sparks ? Communications are down . Woman : Up here ! Hey ! Up here ! Come on ! Come on , let 's go ! Aah ! Aah ! Go ! Watch out ! Go ! Aah ! What 's your assessment of all this , Dr. Flynn ? Um ... . It appears to be a deposition of acidifying particles and gases , coming together to form ... Flaming hail , sir . Really ? And what exactly is our emergency protocol for fire and brimstone , doctor ? Hide underground . Not during a flood . Um , with all due respect , sir , my specialty is analyzing polar ice core and computer images . It 's really Dr. Sparks who ... . Dr. Sparks is unable to be contacted ! Sir , I recommend we expand our evacuation and warning areas to the entire mega region . Excuse me . Yeah , please . I 'm talking San Diego to Los Angeles to Ventura . That 's all of Southern California . Where are these people supposed to evacuate to ? We have to get them East of San Bernardino . That 's 16 million people , sir . That 's impossible ! We 're looking at a severe loss of life with or without evacuation . Sir , doctors Sparks and Cavanaugh have spent years studying these extreme events . Their research is the key to understanding what 's going on , and understanding is the first step to a solution . So if we were to just find them , then we would be- - Thank you , Dr. Flynn . Sir , I have a special team here for you . What do you have ? We got a GPS lock on her location . Dr. Sparks is East of Los Angeles , moving erratically . Traveling on foot . Bring her in . Yes , sir ! Status reports on Fema . Yes , sir . Aah ! Watch out ! Up here ! Come on ! Oh , my god ! Up here ! Come on , up here ! Inside ! Come on , guys . Right this way . [ Cell phone beeps ] Oh ! We can use a land line . Is yours working ? Honey , I haven 't had a land line since 2009 . Come in . I can 't imagine what you 've been through . Yeah , thanks . [ Metal creaking ] [ Static ] Wait a minute . What is it ? Are you getting something ? Hold on . Wilforce-3 to coast guard , come in . [ Static ] Coast guard , do you copy ? Radio operator : Wilforce 3 , mobilizing Hamilton class cutter immediately . They 've heard us . It 's a Hamilton class . It 's on its way . We need to keep the fires under control till they get here . Use whatever resources you need . Thanks . Anything you have , a CB , a ham radio ? Anything we could use ? No , I 'm sorry , I don 't have a radio , I don 't have a phone , but my generator is supplying power . You could charge your phones and your computers . Yeah , that 'll help a lot . Yeah , that 'd be great . Yeah , my battery 's almost completely gone . Can you charge mine , too ? Yeah , no problem . I will . Okay , all right . You got anything ? No , nothing . Hey . You okay ? [ Crying ] No , not really . Come on . Everything 's gonna be okay . I 'm sorry . Listen , hey ... When we get out of this thing ... You hear me ? You mean , if we ever get out of this thing . [ Cell phone rings ] Hello ? Yes , Camp Pendleton ! This is Dr. Jenna Sparks . Hello ? Hello ? What 'd he say ? I don 't know , I lost him . Hey , look , the hail has stopped . That means there 's a break in the low pressure updraft . This is our chance . Let 's get out of here ! Colonel Chadwick ! What is it , Dr. Flynn ? I 'm trying to coordinate a rescue effort . It 's the big tujunga dam , sir . It 's holding back over 7 million gallons of water . The storm 's overloaded it . How many casualties if it goes ? These are very densely populated areas that are going to be completely over-flooded , uh , over 2 million people . Well , commence evacuation immediately ! Yes , sir . Up ahead , make a left . Roger that . Okay , and around the debris . Copy that . Up the canyon . We 're on to them . Wait ! What ? What happened ? I lost signal . Wait , there it is . We 're on to them . Turn ! Hang on ! Oh ! Aah ! Ahem . The dam has breached , sir . How many casualties ? It 's unknown . Search and rescue are on the way , sir . I 'm sorry , uh ... We were just too late . I want maps and status reports of every dam and reservoir in Southern California . Yes , sir . And call the Army Corps of engineers . Yes , sir . Where is my damn team ? Here , take this . No , that 's way too much , Annabel . You have to eat . Just take these at least . All right . Thank you . Thank you . Well , it looks like the storm 's giving us a break . We should go . Yeah , we better take advantage of it . Be safe . Thank you again . [ Horns honk ] Reporter : ... emergency warning system . Widespread flooding has inundated portions of the 405 , 110 , 101 and 5 freeways , forcing major road closures . Do not drive into flooded areas or go around barricades . Storm ocean surge impact level has reached 43 feet . If you are in the path of the storm , take cover immediately . What 's the status on the evacuation ? The situation is not good , sir . Major arteries and freeways are completely blocked . What about public transportation ? Caltrans is reporting that the high winds have knocked three trains off the tracks . People able to get out of the city ? Sir , the 405 , 110 , and 10 are parking lots . People are getting out of their cars and running . Running to where ? There 's nowhere to run to , sir . What about emergency services ? Hospitals are overwhelmed . Fires are burning out of control . We have over 10 million people without power and more every second . What 's the governor saying about all this ? Sir , he 's mobilizing resources , but they just can 't get here to help us fast enough . Word on the street ? Sir , it 's panic . People are scared , confused , and most of them armed . It 's not a good combination . Sir , the president just declared a state of emergency . There are resources being mobilized , but we 're not gonna get any help until the storm is over . Over ? This is just pre-storm turbulence . The storm hasn 't even hit yet ! How we doing on fuel ? We have a little less than a half a tank . I hope that 's enough . Better be . Yeah , well , it 's gonna take longer not taking the freeway . Yeah , every major artery in the city is jammed . Imagine what the I-5 looks like right now . Hell . Oh , hey , hey ! Over here ! Turn on 74 . Hey , the national forest . Yeah , it 's gonna take us out to the back end of the base . Perfect . Yeah , if we have any luck , a marine patrol might pick us up . Mmm . Careful ! I got it , I got it , I got it ! What 's going on with that tree ? Well , looks like it 's starting to let up . The road got washed away . I 'll have to go around it . All right , well , just take it careful . Slow , slow . Here we go . Travis . Travis , the road ! Back up , back up ! Where ? I can 't ! I 'm stuck ! Okay , okay , we got to get out ! Stop the car ! All right , all right . All right . Come on , let 's go ! Be careful ! This way ! Right over here , guys ! I think we can make it across the trees . Come on . Come on , hurry ! Grab my hand ! Unh ! Oh , my god . Doc , let 's go ! Come on ! Come on ! Percy ! You can make it ! Come on , doc ! Hurry up ! The ground 's giving way ! Come on ! Doc , come on ! I can 't reach ! I 'm not gonna make it ! Come on , doc ! You can do it ! You can make it ! I 'm not gonna make it ! Doc , come on ! Come on , doc ! I can 't reach ! Come on ! Can 't reach ! Doc ! Aah ! No ! No ! Aah ! Jenna ! He was just there ! Gone ! He just vanished ! Hamilton class , this is Wilforce-3 . Go ahead . Hamilton class , do you copy ? Mayday ! Mayday ! Radio operator : Wilforce-3 , come in . Hamilton class this is Wilforce-3 installation manager Gary Winters . Winters , this is Commander Jarvis of the U.S. Coast Guard vessel Sherman . Do you require assistance ? God , yes . We are on fire . I need to evacuate approximately 105 men . How far out are you ? Jarvis : The Sherman will be on the scene in approximately 30 minutes . Begin staging for evacuation . Yes , sir . Get all hands on deck and prepare to evacuate immediately . We 'll start with the wounded . Pull whatever guys you need . Grab firefighters if you have to . We 're getting off this rig . No , this is a natural phenomenon . It--It 's a massive sinkhole . Sinkhole ? How ? This bedrock , it 's limestone . It 's turned to mush . Yeah . The water from the storm , it 's acidic . Oil and drilling fluids . Yeah , and it was draining into the ground and dissolving the bedrock . It 's just like exactly what happened in Guatemala City . Where does it go ? It 's got to be 300 or 400 feet . Listen , we got to get out of here . We got to get back to the base . Come on . I can 't believe he 's gone . Come on ! Winters : We 're listing ! We 're capsizing ! Come on . We 're gonna you guys out of here . Can I get some help over here ? Jarvis , on radio : Winters , come in . There she is ! There 's the Sherman ! Help ! Get all the wounded down to the lower deck ! I want all hands in life jackets ! What about the firefighters ? We 'll get everyone else off first , and they 'll be the last off the rig . I don 't want to take any chances ! Good . Why has the radio gone dead ? Where is she ? Are you seeing this ? Take cover ! Move , move ! Hey , Travis , look ! Hey , help ! Hey ! Hey , help ! Hands up ! You 're trespassing on restricted property . Move . No , no , no . What are you talking about ? Back up . Let me explain . I 'm Dr. Jenna Sparks . This is Travis Verdon . What 'd we do ? I 'm placing both of you under arrest . For what ? You 're trespassing on a restricted area . Pull the bed down . Now hop up . Now you , put those on her . Is this really necessary ? Do it now ! All right . [ Clicking ] All right . Now you put those on him behind his back . Look , where are you taking us ? Fort Irwin . No , no ! You have to take us to Camp Pendleton . Sorry , I 'm taking you to Fort Irwin . Sir , she 's trying to tell you what we 've been through . Shut it ! I have two intruders in custody . I 'll bring them in now . Travis , he 's taking us to the wrong base . My hands are too tight . What ? You 're gonna have to do it . Choke him out . What ? Yeah , the element of surprise . Just get up behind him and stay in control , okay ? You up for this ? Base , do you copy ? I 'll just--I 'll give you the nod , all right ? All right . All right , now slide up in the bed . I can 't do it . My hands are too tight . You 're gonna have to help me . Do it now ! [ Jenna grunting ] [ Choking ] Come on ! Cut me loose ! Okay ! Cut me loose ! Okay , okay ! Cut me loose , I said ! [ Coughing ] All right , loosen him , loosen him . Okay . Stay right there . [ Coughing ] All right . Okay . Very slowly , Get on your radio and have them patch you to Colonel Chadwick . Do it now ! I need an emergency patch-through To Colonel Chadwick at Pendleton . [ Coughs ] Is that an affirmative ? Then , yes , bring Dr. Jenna Sparks here immediately . They 're on the way . [ Alarm blaring ] [ Coughing ] Structural support is losing integrity . Areas of the rig are already collapsing . How much time do we have ? An hour , maybe two . What are our options ? The Sherman was- - I don 't even know what I saw out there . Our only hope is rescue . Alex , nobody 's coming for us . We got to fight if we want to save our own lives . Yes , sir . Think . Now , is there anything that you can do to keep us out of that lava ? The super cyclone is turning 16 million Southern Californians into refugees . There may be an option . If you have any ideas , doctor , now is the time . It was Dr. Cavanaugh 's theory , but I think I can explain it . This super cyclone is unique because its formation was created by man . How so ? Travis . He can best explain what happened on that rig . Yeah . The Wilforce-3 was designed to drill deeper into the earth 's crust than any other rig had gone before . I mean , we knew there would be problems at first , but we never saw anything quite like this . So what exactly did happen out there ? Well , the drill pierced the earth 's crust , broke into the mantle and penetrated a magma pocket , and the lava flowed into the rig . You synthesized a super volcano . This new super volcano , it 's bigger than Mauna Loa . So how does this volcano tie into the storm ? The massive quantities of lava elevated the water temperature , which created a low pressure vortex around the Wilforce-3 . And now the atmosphere around the rig is highly unstable . And your solution ? Well , if you can deliver a payload of silver iodide nano-flakes into the storm , we can generate a controlled lightning strike to break up the vortex . How do you propose we deliver this payload ? Do you have any pilot who can navigate under these conditions ? Dr. Sparks , you 're talking about a suicide mission . No , you don 't know that for sure . The hurricane hunters were able to ... . Those planes fly at 45,000 feet . You 're talking about flying an F-16 directly into the eye wall of a storm . Colonel Chadwick , sir ? Sergeant Major ? Sir , I might have a man , a pilot , who can do the job . Who ? Lieutenant Dave Connelly . Connelly ? He 's fresh from combat , sir , but I know he can do the job . He 's an expert in maneuvering . He 's just a kid . He 's our only hope , sir . Find him . Make sure he knows the risks . This is volunteer only . Yes , sir . So , you need someone crazy , huh ? Apparently . The payload is secure . When do I deploy ? The nano-flakes must be released as you enter the eye wall of the storm . That 's where the electrical charge is the strongest . How will I know ? We 'll track you on radar . We 've established a high-frequency communication link . I 'll give you the signal at the right time . I 'm ready to do what needs to be done . Son , if you 're successful , you 'll save millions of lives . My whole family lives in Southern California , sir . Good luck , Lieutenant . Thank you , sir . Okay , he 's entering the primary frontal boundary . Approaching target area . You 're doing great , Lieutenant . You 'll be entering the rain shield soon . It 's going to get choppy . Roger . Once he can clear the spiral bands , he 'll have a straight shot at the eye wall . Hey , what 's going on with his radar tag ? [ Beeping ] Lieutenant , come in . [ Radar beeping ] Connelly , can you hear me ? Is there anything- - Anything we can do ? We gather the men , we go to the highest ground . Abandon our posts . Go out fighting . Fighting is all we can do ... Sir . Let 's go . [ Alarm ] [ Jet roaring ] It 's an F-16 ! Maybe it 's another rescue attempt . Hold on . [ Radar beeping ] There ! There he is ! Connelly , do you read ? Are you there ? Connelly : Yes , ma 'am . I 'm flying fast towards it . Great , great . Connelly , you 'll be approaching the target area in less than two minutes . Lieutenant , this is Travis Verdon . I 'm an engineer from the Wilforce-3 rig . Can you see her ? There 's something there , sir . Don 't let go ! Take my hand ! Hold me ! I got you ! Hold me ! Don 't let go ! Don 't let it go ! Aah ! No ! Aah ! Aah ! Connelly , what do you see ? A lake of fire , lava flares . I never thought it 'd end like this . It 's been an honor . You , too , sir . [ Screaming ] I guess there 's some fights you just don 't win . We tried . Yes , sir . So how do we do this ? Jump . I don 't think I can do this , Gary ! Yeah , you can . Just let go . [ Screaming ] [ Screaming ] [ Screaming ] [ Screaming ] Few more seconds . Okay , Connelly , t-minus 10 , 9 , 8 ... Jenna : 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 ... No ! Where 's his radar tag ? Where 's Connelly ? The flare . He 's gone . Chadwick : Connelly , come in . Connelly--Connelly , do you read ? No ! Oh , my god . He was our last hope . He was a hero . Travis : The Wilforce-3 , she 's gone . Sir , the storm , it 's moving inland . Sir , you got to listen ! There 's got to be a manmade force powerful enough to stop this . Unless there 's some way to convince our boys from Thule to drag an iceberg down here from Greenland , I 'm gonna have to tell the General that the situation 's fubar . Wait , wait , wait , I 've got an idea ! Dr. Sparks , I appreciate your enthusiasm , But I just had one of my top pilots Fly an F-16 into a super volcano for nothing ! Colonel . Colonel , wait , please ! You 've got to listen ! Bring in the generators . No , sir , Huntington Beach is out of commission . Jenna : Colonel ! Colonel ? You have to listen . What , Dr. Sparks ? We need to go on one more mission . Absolutely not . I 'm not gonna let another man fly to his death . You won 't have to . I 'll go , sir . Me , too . What kind of a mission are you guys talking about ? We need to deprive the storm of its energy source . This storm is completely uncontrollable . You 've seen that . We use liquid nitrogen . It 'll form a plug , stop the flow of lava , and cool the water . How are we gonna get liquid nitrogen to the site ? We 'll take it in a liquefied natural gas tanker . It 's like a giant thermos with a pumping system . Where are we gonna find one of these giant thermos tankers ? Petro-Cal in long beach has one right now . Who 's gonna drive it ? I will , sir . So how you gonna keep it from melting ? The ocean currents are moving the lava to the East , so there 's a small corridor of water that would allow the tanker passage , but it won 't last long . Yeah , but if I can get in there with the tanker , I could deliver the payload . How you gonna get out ? A chopper evac . I see . Using the size of the original bore hole conduit and factoring in the expanse of the lava throat ... 135,000 cubic meters would generate a substantial plug . Yeah , tanker Euclides would do it . And I 'll be on the tanker monitoring the atmospheric conditions . I 'll know exactly when the storm is destroyed . Is this a permanent solution ? Yes , sir . Yes , permanent . Where we gonna find 135,000 cubic meters of liquid nitrogen ? Vandenberg . They 've got huge tanks of liquid nitrogen out there for the rocket launches , sir . And once the cool water sucks the energy out of the super cyclone , it will be more like a thunderstorm rather than hurricane . What do you think , sir ? I think if you 're wrong ... Most of the West Coast is gonna die , including us . Colonel . Once we arrive on site , the crew will have less than 15 minutes to deploy the l.N. before our window closes and the lava completely destroys the tanker 's outer hull . I 'll be controlling a laser-guided targeting system to navigate the payload drop so we can make every second count . The chopper will be sure to evacuate you and your team off the tanker before she goes down . Yeah , it 's gonna be a rough ride no matter how we time it . Yeah , well , we 're cutting it very close , so we better get going . Yep , this is it . Good luck . Thank you . Hey , Travis , you control the nav , and I 'll take care of operations . Okay . Chadwick : What 's the status ? The Euclides is on its way , sir . [ Radio chatter ] They 're gonna thread the needle through that cooler water . Even with a ship that size , sir ... This storm is a monster . Yeah , Colonel , we 're approaching target area . Crew , prepare to deploy liquid nitrogen . Travis , on loudspeaker : Open the valve on the pump and load the l.N. into the sprayer . Be careful , boys , there 's a lot of pressure down there . [ Rattling ] Travis , something 's wrong . The hull is dissolving too quickly . The current is pulling us off course . We 're losing our window . We 're caught in a whirlpool ! The current is pulling us under ! Colonel , we 're in trouble ! Send the chopper now ! Deploy rescue chopper now ! Colonel ? Colonel ! Rescue chopper is en route , Jenna ! It 's en route ! Position the sprayer and release the valve . Crewman : Valve released . It 's too hot ! It 's too hot ! Deploy the l.N. Now ! The temperatures are dropping . [ Metal creaking ] Uhh ! [ Gasps ] The hull 's breached , but it 's too soon . Something 's wrong . She 's on auto-pilot . She 's circling with the whirlpool . [ Squeaking ] [ Hissing ] [ Bolt explodes ] Travis : Delivering the l.N. until she goes down . Something 's definitely not right . Time to evacuate ! All hands topside ! We are evacuating ! Prepare to abandon ship ! Prepare to abandon ship ! The temperatures are rising again ! Okay , we got to go now ! Travis : Yeah , go topside and make sure all the men are accounted for . All right . Travis , don 't be long , okay ? We don 't have much time left . Travis , where are you ? [ Creaking ] Travis , get up here ! No ! We got to wait for him ! There 's one more man ! Travis ! Travis , can you hear me ? No , there 's one more man ! Get us out of here ! We can 't leave him ! Reporter : 36 hours of steady rainfall has left many homes in the metro area knee-deep in floodwaters . Temperatures are normalizing . The storm 's breaking up . [ Thunder ] Mobilize search and rescue and get the governor on the phone . Is this over ? Is this really over ? Congratulations , Colonel . Let 's hope it sticks . The super cyclone 's breaking up ! I 'm so sorry . You did it , Travis . [ Sighs ] Must have gotten pretty hairy on that tanker . Dr. Flynn , uh , if you don 't mind , I 'd rather be alone . Okay , yeah , um ... I totally understand . I 'll just be below decks if you need me . Thank you . Captain Worley , 10 : 00 , do you see it ? Yes , I do . What 's going on ? There 's something out there . What is it ? I don 't know , but we 're gonna go closer to take a look . It 's a person ! Captain Worley , do you see it ? It 's a person ! I see it ! I see it ! Worley : Throw the net . Let 's reel him in . [ Winch grinding ] Jenna : Is it him ? It is him ! Travis , it is you ! He 's alive . Go get some water and a blanket . You 're gonna be fine . You 're gonna be okay . Travis , can you hear me ? Okay , can you get up ? Yeah . Give me a hand . All right . Captain Worley ? Yeah , we got him . Take us back . Aye , aye , Dr. Sparks , With pleasure . Here . Travis ? Travis , come on . All right , easy , easy . Watch your foot , watch your foot . Okay . Hey , uh ... Thanks for not giving up on me . You 're welcome . Hey , look , a rainbow . Actually , it 's , um , a circumhorizontal arc . It 's the off-gassing of liquid nitrogen , and it creates these , um , plate-shaped crystals in the clouds . It 's amazing , huh ? Yeah . It 's beautiful .

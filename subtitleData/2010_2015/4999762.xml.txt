 The original Fringe team didn 't vanish . - They aren 't missing . - Right . They 're in amber . Previously on Fringe : Olivia . Olivia , breathe . You 're in the year 2036 . I want you to meet Etta . Hi , Mama . Where 's Walter ? Don 't move . Who freed you and your team from the amber ? What plan ? To defeat us ? Air control malfunction . Walter . Do you recognize this ? It 's meant to collect and make sense of the scrambled plan in your mind . What plan ? You know , I think that I would be happy to stay here for the rest of my life . We should probably get her home soon . Get her into a bath , which is never easy . Heh . I nominate you for that one . Etta . Come on , kiddo . It 's time to go home . Etta . Etta , come here , now . Laceration , upper right quadrant . - Excuse me , what happened ? - You were caught in a blast . She was with us . - She was a little girl . - Peter ? I 'm sorry . There were no children brought in . That can 't be right . She was in front of me . People are lost all over the city . They 're coming in ... She 's around here . Where are they taking the kids ? - Etta . - Peter . Etta ! You okay ? You were dreaming about her . You said her name . - I 'm still trembling . - I know . For us , it 's like it all just happened a couple of months ago . But it didn 't . She 's here , and we 're here . We 're okay now . - Good morning . - Not for Walter . - Something 's wrong . - Why ? What 's up ? Not this thing working can 't it 's not . The thought unifier 's having adverse effects . He 's talking out of sequence . Two hours ago the Christmas tree Macy 's sale to have a nap . - Get that thing off of him . - Okay . I 'm not an amateur . I need this contraption if I am to retrieve the plan to defeat the Observers from my memory . We don 't know if there 's anything to retrieve . We don 't know what that thing is doing to you . Swedish ? He was speaking Portuguese earlier . Good morning . - I hope the floor wasn 't too bad . - No . I slept well , thank you . Thanks . So how 's it coming ? So far we know that in the past Walter knew Portuguese and Swedish . Other than that , nothing . Come on . Walter you 've always documented things . So are you absolutely sure that you didn 't write anything down ? I can 't remember , but anything is possible . Even if there were files , you can 't go back to Harvard . We can 't get in . Why not ? It was taken over by Observers five years ago . Some kind of base , or ... No one knows exactly . The entire four-mile radius is a no-go zone . Why can 't we get into Harvard ? It 's been taken over by Observers . Well , that 's not a problem for someone who 's done acid . So are these barriers around Walter 's lab checkpoints ? Yeah . No one gets in without paperwork . Tunnels . We don 't have time to dig tunnels , or the manpower . We don 't have to dig them . They 're already there . Steam tunnels . Right beneath us , two-and-one-quarter miles of tunnels ... that house the steam pipes that heat Harvard . They stretch from the Cambridge Electric Company plant on Western Avenue to Soldiers Field , to the law school , to the science labs . They made sure the entrances were well-hidden . Few have seen the mysterious passageways . Peter . Yahtzee . The temperature in the tunnels usually hovers around 100 degrees sometimes as high as 120 . You might want to take that coat off , dear . Sometimes , Belly and I would wear swim trunks . Speedos . What was that ? Quick , out of the way ! Hey . I 've been looking for you . This way . Oh , my . I must have ambered it . Why ? To protect it , I imagine . What is it ? My Betamax recorder on a tripod . Look where it 's standing . Look at the blast pattern . This is the amber point of origin . I must have been standing right here when I ambered this lab . I don 't think I wrote anything down . I think I was making a video . The question is , is the tape still in there ? There 's only one way to find out . Heh . When did I switch to grape ? On your knees . Who are you people ? What are you doing here ? He 's a Loyalist . He 's not gonna tell us anything . Gael Manfretti . Nothing but bread crumbs . Baldies feed you well , Gael . of his patrol . Why would he have come here ? The place is abandoned . For all we know , we tripped some silent alarm . Someone 's gonna notice him missing sooner or later . We need to stay . If that camera is the key to helping Walter remember , we have to get it . I need a laser . What about the device I used to free you with ? No , it won 't work . Amber 's too thick . It 'll push the camera further in . I need a proper laser . Walter , could you make one ? Where there 's a will , there 's a way . There 's no power . At all . Well , the ambering must 've blown everything . I think it 's blown all the way back to the campus substation . Well , a laser needs power , Peter . Substation 's in the basement of the science building . - That 's the only way we 'll get power . - We can use the tunnels . Wait . We don 't know if it 's the science building anymore . We have no idea what 's in there or what could be waiting for us . We don 't , but he does . I 'm sure he knows plenty . You don 't seem to talk much . I 'm gonna give you one more chance . What do you know about the science building ? You 're a real open book . That 's okay . I 'm good at opening books . Where did you get that ? It 's not important . - What 's important ... - Aah . ... Is that I have it . What do they use the science building for ? I don 't think you wanna waste any more precious time . Criterion Collection , forgive me . Walter , it 's just a laserdisc player . We need the laser . - Peter . - Don 't . No , no . No . It should be me . Walter , I don 't think this laserdisc tube can generate enough power . We need a better gain ratio . Flying vermin . You 'd think after 21 years the Observers would have found a way to get rid of them first . Or at least found a use for them . Maybe freeze-dry them and hand them out to the poor as sustenance . We need a helium-neon mix . Should be one or two canisters- - - In the storage room off my office . - I 'll get them . I 'm gonna ask you again . What do we need to know about the science building ? Etta ? What are you doing ? It 's called an Angel Device . It stirs up and destabilizes every atom in his body . Full charge steals around 25 , 30 years . But this is a long way from a full charge . He 's so disorientated by the process , he loses the will to lie . Or he holds out until his heart fails . Most of them give us what we need to know . And if they don 't ... - What are you doing ? - Giving him water . You wanna kill him , go ahead . That 's how you 'll do it . He can 't have water yet . Not for another three hours . He 's not worth a single tear . Loyalists sell out their own kind , like rats . I know you just woke up , but look around you , Mom . Can 't you see what the Observers have brought ? This is war . And we 're losing . Etta . I 'll be right back . Just don 't get too near him . Walter , what 's up ? Don 't you wear a necklace ? The clasp was loose . - I took it off to try to fix it . - Hm . - Why ? - Then you won 't mind me melting it down . Don 't worry . We just need the silver for solder . Thank you . How do I look ? Like you 're in pain . You know , my absence won 't go unnoticed . I don 't believe that anybody 's coming to look for you . See , I don 't think you 're here because we were seen or because we triggered some sort of alert I think , heh , that you came here to feed the birds . I 'm guessing you 're not even supposed to be in this building . So even if you are missed , this would be the last place anybody would look . You need to tell her what she wants to know now . You need to tell her before you get worse . You 've already lost years of your life . Now , come on , you must have something to live for . - I 'm trying to help you . - You don 't have the authority to do that . Do you ? What authority do I need ? A Loyalist doesn 't walk away when captured by the resistance . How can you be so sure ? Where are you from ? Why ? You 're new to the resistance . I 've been around a lot longer than you may think . Look . I 'm not gonna survive this . And I 'm not afraid to die so I will tell her what she needs to know if ... If you will go and tell my son I 'm not coming home . And that I loved him very much . I don 't want him to keep looking for me . I don 't want him hoping he 'll see me again . I 've seen that too many times , people waiting for people who never come home . Everyone has an access code . You can 't get in without one . And what 's in the building ? The main power grid is still there . Other than that , I don 't know . I don 't go below the first floor . - We don 't ask . Rumors , mainly . - What kind of rumors ? - Experiments . - On what ? On everything . My access code is a two-part code . The first part is 0-1-0-5-6-7 . And the second part ? Me . Can we beat an ocular scanner ? We have his code to access the building , but there are scanners at every point . Well , that didn 't take long . What 's wrong ? Where does this come from ? Barbaric . What has the world come to ? How could the resistance create such a device ? We didn 't . The Loyalists did . It 's old second-gen Observer tech . It was designed to prepare Observers for time travel but as you can see , the Loyalists figured out a new way to use it , on us . No reason we shouldn 't use it on them . It 's just a transport truck . We 're okay . Ahem . Well as far as ocular scanners go the only surefire way is to bring him with you . It 's impossible . Look at him . I 'm gonna look at your eye . If you can 't bring him with you , there 's only one way . - I agree . - Walter , you can 't- - Of course I can . Rather easily , in fact . Astril I 'm going to need a sharp scalpel and my long-handled stainless spoon . I 'll need another . Pay attention to the texture . Make sure it 's spongy . You know , the Vietnamese consider pigs ' eyes to be a delicacy . Even ones that have been sitting in formaldehyde for 20 years ? Ugh . - Yes , that should do nicely . - Sure this will work , Walter ? In a pig 's eye . I wonder what the origin of that term- - - Walter . - Mm ? Oh . Certainly . An iris is like a fingerprint . Each has its own unique pattern . If we can mimic that pattern we can trick the scanner into thinking that this pig 's eye is our tattooed friend there . The world has changed so much . It can be difficult to understand it . I 'm not sure I want to understand it . - Not bad . - Yeah ? - You 're next . - How 's he doing ? He 's getting there . Thank you . For what ? When I said it was logical for me to go turn the power on instead of you that I know protocol if something goes off track and that Peter should go because he 's the engineer ... I appreciate you respecting my experience . Because I know you 'd rather it be you . I know you like to be in control . So do I. I did my best , but it has to be exact . Well , is this exact ? We 'll find out . Gentlemen . Why does someone join the Loyalists ? Pain . There were resistance fighters near my building . They were gonna blow up a city bus full of them . Invaders . My children were outside . One of them was killed . My eldest boy . I 'm sorry . I know something about losing a child . So after that moment I just wanted to be safe . I was angry at the resistance because , heh " " It 's hopeless . So I do this job . They give us a safe place to live get taken care of , they look after us . And I don 't have to worry at least about my boy . I 'll never understand you people . You can 't win . The world would be a much safer place if you 'd just stop trying to fight them . What 's Manfretti doing in Building 4 ? That 's not his sector . Manfretti , come in . Over . Manfretti ? Answer it . We had an agreement . Now answer it . Hey there . What 's up ? Why are you accessing the Medical Science wing ? You 're supposed to be in Sector 7 . Tell him that you needed to change a fuse . A fuse blew . Uh , I went to fix it . Since when does security change fuses ? Who asked you to do that ? Number 19 . Big Guy 19 ? Really ? Yeah . Really . Change your stupid fuse and get back to your post . You knew if they went to that area they wouldn 't be cleared . No , I didn 't . I 've never been anywhere I wasn 't supposed to be . Simon . Etta . Etta . No , no . Stop . Stop . What are you doing ? We have to keep moving . Think of the tape . Think about what 's on it . Think about your future . There will be a time for vengeance and grieving but it is not now . Stop . Stop . They 'll pay for what they 've done . I promise . Do you really think you can win ? Well , we have to win . So that all the people that died including your son , didn 't die for nothing . Now . Let there be light . Walter , we have to turn them off or someone could see us . Let 's see if this still works . Yes . - You ready ? - Yep . - Ahem . - Ahem . Invigorating . You want a go ? Peter ? What happened ? Etta . I 'm , um- - I 'm really sorry about Agent Foster . Freedom has its costs . Simon knew that . Get up . You 're traveling . Where are you taking him ? - He 's useless to us now . I 'm turning him over to the resistance . He says no one ever comes back . Resistance fighters don 't come back when they 're taken in by Loyalists . HQ will get what they can from him and dispose of him , and the world will be a tiny bit safer . I know you 're upset , but he did give us the code . Yeah , of course he did . It 's natural human instinct . To live as long as possible . It 's the same quality they use to turn us into slaves . He joined them in order to protect what was left of his family . - His son . - He 's a liar . That 's what they 're trained to do . He has no son . He gave you the code because he saw in your eyes a weakness . He saw in your eyes that you could be manipulated . That maybe- - Maybe he could convince you to let him go . But that 's not gonna happen , sweetheart . Etta . - I understand how hurt you must be- - - You don 't know my world . You 're right . I don 't know your world . But I had hoped for you that wherever you were you weren 't hardened by what had happened to you . And it 's not that I don 't see what the Observers have brought , I do . But what concerns me more is what they 've taken away . This is the world . It is what it is . Don 't move . 143 Dunstable Street number 7 . His name is Oscar . I keep my word . I know you do . Walter . - I need a sedative . - Hm . That can be arranged . It 's a comm device . If Walter needs anything else for the laser , I 'll be able to get it for him . There you are . You don 't have a son , do you ? No . I was hoping , right up until the last minute that she could somehow convince you . You were right about me . I became a Loyalist because I 'm a coward . Get out of here . I 'm gonna fight . For the resistance . I want you to know that . You don 't have to lie , I already let you go . This time I hope you 'll believe me . This can come in useful . There aren 't many resistance fighters with an active tat ID . You said I saw something in her eyes , right ? You were right . There was a ... A certainty that I 've never seen before . And I don 't know how to explain it other than to say I felt for the first time that we were supposed to win . Why are you letting me live ? Something that I saw in her eyes as well . Pity . Pity for who ? For all of us . Got it . Looks like the heat from the laser might have damaged the PVC . It might have damaged the tape . I told you we should have gone slower . Whoever you are if you found this tape , you 've retrieved it from amber . If you are watching this , then you know very well that the Observers have invaded and I am most probably dead and unfortunately , my plan to stop them has failed . I have documented all the parts of the plan on videotapes . You must recover each tape and follow the instructions on each of those tapes to retrieve all the parts of the plan . Once you do so , what you need to do will be clear to you . If successful , this plan will restore us and rid the world of the Observers . You were chosen for this . This is your destiny . I understand if you 're frightened , it will not be easy , but I trust that the same will that brought you here will keep you going . It ... Be gentle , Peter . I 'm on my way back . Okay . Here we go . But I trust that the same will that brought you here will keep you going . It is important that you follow the tapes . You must begin this journey right away . You are humanity 's only hope . Now you must retrieve the first tape .

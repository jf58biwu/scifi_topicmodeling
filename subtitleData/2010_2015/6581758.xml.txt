 Subtitles by Renatinha Tankinha . - Come on , come on . Grab onto me ! - Help ! - Dad ? - Rick ! Rick ! - Dad ! No ! - Lucas ! - Tremors have started again . Three to four times a day now . Maybe it 's because everything just keeps getting colder all the time . I don 't know . Everyone 's afraid . It reminds me of when I was a boy . Comet U-23 hurtled through our solar system . And the whole world watched . Waiting to see if the comet meant life or death . The comet struck the Pacific with the magnitude of all the nuclear weapons in all the world . Cults were gone in minutes . The inlet surge flooded the Great Plains . My father was a ranger in the sanction of Crystal Mountains in Colorado . We escaped the flooding . We were the lucky few . Then the freezing began . Comet U-23 had knocked the Earth out of its orbit . That was 10,000 days ago . I was five . I am now a man of 31 and a leader of our clan . My name is Lucas Beck . Remy Farnwell 's family lived with our clan for 15 years . Remy claims they were forced out . And now they covet what is ours , tried to kill us . The men who were once our brothers are now our enemies . And now we have Farnwells living to our north and south waiting . Always waiting . - Mom , another stone , quick . - Over here , dad . Lam ' em down easy . - Here we go . - Where did you find him ? - He came from the north . - Farnwells clan . - He was alone ? - Yeah , he was alone . I found him on the putter ice field . - Were there stress fractures ? - No . There was an uplifting in the ice . - So it 's true ? The ice is thickening . - Lower your voice . - You 're afraid , I understand that . Last winter we saw this , the uplifting in the ice . I won 't have you scaring everyone . - They 're already scared , Lucas . Unlike your father , we chose not to be in denial . The boy was alone . They 're all dead ; You know it . - That 's enough . Where 's your family , boy ? - The ice took ' em . - Took ' em how ? - Please , we wanna help . - It was like ... something evil had just come up and crushed them . - How long ago ? - It was morning . - There could still be survivors . - Boy , do you think anyone survived ? - No . - How 's he doing ? - Well , he 's scared , doesn 't trust us . - Veena , you know he has to go . - Lucas said this ? - No , my brother said nothing . - So why do you say he has to go ? - The clan 's safety isn 't important to you ? - Of course it is , but someone has to care for this boy . - The Farnwells care for their own . I mean it . If he stays here , Remy will come for him . If we don 't have enough rations ... - Well , I 'll share mine . Lucas would agree with me . - You expect too much from my brother . You always have . - You think Lucas would send this boy where even he is afraid to go ? - Lucas is afraid of nothing . - You 're wrong . He fears . Not for himself , but he fears for all of us . And that I 'd understand . But that is no reason to send this boy to what may be his death . - It 's Farnwell 's ice , man . - I 'll check it out . - Milo ! - Here . - Oh my God . - What is it ? - Dad . - This is fantastic . - You said the ship was blue and white ? - Yeah . - Any lettering ? A name ? - Three letters . UNI . Above the windows or below ? - Above . - You know the president was in the air when the come hit . They thought the east coast was ground zero . But instead of sending them to Mount Weather in Virginia , they sent them west . To Edwards . - You think it was the Air Force One ? - I won 't know for sure until we get inside . - What 's an an force one ? - Remember when you were a kid we used to lay out on the roof and watch for the planes to go overhead I told you to watch for the biggest one ? - I 'm surprised they 're not flying on the White House . - Air Force One . - None of this explains how they ended up frozen in an ice field here at the Sangre De Cristo 's . - No it doesn 't , but I 'm predicting no one made it off the jet . - Why do you say that ? - You said the doors are sealed . The crew has sent out survivors . - Their fuze launch was intact . Somebody must have survived . - So why didn 't they leave the jet ? - Maybe it was safer inside . - What are we gonna find on that jet ? - It 's a time capsule . - We could find anything . - Some pillows would be really nice . - I 'll see you in the back . - Help me get the gear together . - Where are we going ? - Hey guys , I got a theory . They were headed west not knowing they were headed towards the comet 's impact zone . - You want a son , I understand . - He has no family , and if I raise him , what 's wrong with that ? - You 've told Lucas ? Why do you find it so difficult to be honest with him ? - Everything about us is difficult . Boy ? I told him to stay put ! - Here you go . - What are you doing ? - It 's okay . He 's starving . - Your sister 's the doctor . Okay ? Not you . - Yes , but I know when someone needs to eat . It 's okay . Eat . - You gave him a full trout ? Are you crazy ? That 's a six-month ration . Look ... - It 's okay . - You gotta stop wasting our resources on this kid . We can 't trust him . He 's a Farnwell . - And he can 't trust us if we 're whispering and keeping secrets . - Whoa , wait . - Wait ! - He didn 't leave the building . - We 're gonna get in so much trouble . - Wait ! Don 't run ! - Stop it . It 's okay . It 's okay . - We need to lock him up our put him out . - No , dad ! He 's just a boy ! - He 's a danger to us all just by being here . - Please , Lucas , you can 't treat him like an animal . - We all know Remy will come for him . - And so he will do what ? - This can 't happen again . He 's under your charge . - Why is it that we always get stuck powering these blood lamps ? - You 're such a baby . - It 's because they like feeding on young blood and besides , our bodily fluids can replenish faster than old peoples ' . My arms hurt . Your turn to charge flashlights . I 'm done . Come on , trade . - Hey , I heard that . Who are you calling old ? - You know what I mean . - Listen , as soon as those blood lamps are full , bring them downstairs , okay ? We 're heading the ice lines . - Is there another door ? - All the other doors are closed with too much ice in the way . - Can you see through the ice ? Come over here . - Hey right over here . - Why you 're writing a journal still baffles me . - So not to forget how . - Paper is precious fuel , sister . - Going to the northern clan ? - Yeah . - Send greetings to my nephews . Give these to them . Tell them I love them and health to your wife . - Our father , he brought these from a tiny island in the Caribbean . Aruba . - Yes . From a time and place I 've never known . - Imagine a home where you never cover your skin , never feel cold . Lucas has had a taste of this . - His clan feels the cold , too . - Your good will toward the Becks is misguided . What is that ? Product of love ? - A desire for peace , brother . - Peace ... When our father fought to keep disease from the clan , Lucas ' father ignored him . He brought death to our mother . - We were one clan then . I don 't blame them as you do . You and father started that fight . - You lost us our home ! - And in the ten years since , what have they offered us ? - Then they should open the doors to all of us . They don 't have the resources , so you would take from them and offer them death . I want no part in your fight . - Oh ! I fight for our lives . 'Cause next year the temperature will drop another four degrees as it does every year . And Lucas and his clan will be alive in the observatory , and their doors will not be open to our dying children ! Will they ? Just so you understand , nothing good will come of your love for Lucas . - Whoa . - Hey , when was the last time you got new clothes ? - This is Air Force One . - Where 's David ? - Where 's David ? - David ? - David ! - What ? - David ! David ! - David ! - David ! - David ? David , where are you ? - Do you see him ? - What is all this ? - Something that could save our lives . - The Northern Plan is gone . - Gone ? - All 40 solds . Dead . - Lucas is responsible . - We refuse to give him shelter . He keeps us all out here on the ice . It 's the third time this week they 're pollinated . We 're gonna have a great harvest . - I need more insulin . Mom 's blood sugar 's been elevated . - She 's been doing so well on half doses lately . - Well , yes , but she stopped exercising . - We 've got to get her back on that bike . - Alright , well , you talk to her , please . - The pumpkin harvest wasn 't so good , so I 've mixed a new cocktail of . Cinnamon and Turmeric . I don 't know how well she 'll respond to it . How 's her circulation ? - Not great . She 's developed a skin condition on her toes . - And how 's the boy ? - He 's resting . He enjoys William 's guitar . Let 's hope this works . - Amelie . You can 't be here . - Please . - No ! How 'd you get passed the guards ? - Lucas showed me the way in case I ever needed to come . - I will not be a part of this . - Please , give him this message . - Before I change my mind . No , go . - You 're certain this equipment can save us ? - It has the potential to save our lives , Lucas . But there are risks . - We need to be very clear on those risks , David . Lucas doesn 't understand it . - That I get it . - You get it ? You understand this technology has the power to destroy everything that we 've done , everything we 've worked for , everything that we 've built to secure our future in an instant . Do you understand that ? - What future ? Tell me . What future ? More snow ? More ice ? More freezing cold ? More fighting ? Ask Sam . He 'll tell you we 're living on borrowed time . All this , whatever we 've done or built , is a waste of time . I am willing to risk everything to change the future . - A boy . One of ours . - Someone came from the south and found him . - No ... they took him . - We 're taking on hit . We 've got a lot of comet fragments everywhere . Alpha 28955 dropping . Speed 219 . - Full G force . - Affirmative . So much smoke down there . 8850 , close that door . Whoa , we are hit ! Right wing is on fire . - We 're going down ! Air force one , stopping below the clouds . - Oh my God . - Pull up ! - Water . Ah , plenty of altitude . 7900 . - Pull up ! ... Pull , pull up , pull up ! Pull up ! - I 'm trying ! - They never made it back over the Sangre De Cristo 's . The tsunami the comet created must have been enormous . Imagine a 4 , 000 foot wave rolling over the western states . Fighting the valleys , heading mountain passes . Now we know how they ended up here . - Tell me about the weapons . - All of this is NEA technology . Airborne operations was retrofitted into Air force One . - Why ? - So the president , secretary of defense , military chiefs of staff , could fight a nuclear war from the air . - Lucas . - Dad , please . I need to understand our options here . All of them . I think we have access to the entire US nuclear arsenal . - How powerful are these weapons ? - Imagine the heat of the sun , right here , on earth , and for a split second releasing its energy all of it at once . - And you 're actually saying that 's an option ? - So if we super heat a small portion of the continent maybe we save ourselves from freezing to death . - In theory . - Why wouldn 't we do that ? - Because it sounds really dangerous . - Since when has anything dangerous bothered you ? - You don 't know what these bombs are capable of , son . You grew up without any knowledge of a cold war or fear of nuclear terrorism ? The radiation released from a single nuclear bomb could kill us , all of us . And there is no guarantee that we won 't chain reaction when we do it . We 're try and detonate one of these things , we might get ten , we might get fifty , we might get one hundred . David , am I right ? - Yes . - So we do nothing . We have all this technology , this powerful resource , and we sit on it ? Really , Sam ? You 're afraid ? - Yeah , a little . But I still think it 's worth a shot . - Right . Perhaps David and I can trace the identity of the of the individual weapons to their silos . We can try and establish the ideal distance for a nuclear blast with the least amount of radiation poisoning . - If in fact such an ideal exists , and only if we can get a signal to reach the silos . - I 'm sorry , but I don 't agree . Are we so terrified that we 're willing to radiate our planet and risk destroying everything that we 've built ? David , we have seen the results when men act out of fear . Before we detonate a nuclear weapon we have to make damn sure , absolutely certain , that it 's our last option . I understand that the situation is desperate , I know that we have a drop in temperature , I know we have extreme weather . But I 'm convinced it 's mirrored by a warming trend in another part of the planet . These are clear manifestations of global warming . - Dad , come on . You can 't prove it . - I 've been studying the night sky since the soot cleared two decades ago , Lucas , and I 'm not dreaming when I see Venus and Mars lining up on the horizon like they used to when the comet hit . What I see is a return to unity . The Sun 's gravity has been pulling us back into our natural orbit for decades now . And I know that like I know you two are my sons . Two years from now , maybe , maybe five we 're gonna be hiking right down this mountain ... - Dad , you 've been telling me this story since I was seven . And I believed you , but now I 'm sorry , it 's just wishful thinking . And the sad thing is you still believe it . - It 's from Amalie . I wouldn 't give this to you if it weren 't for the love my daughter had for you , and her desire for your happiness . Be careful . - Have you made a decision about the boy ? - No , I haven 't . - Lucas , why is it so difficult for you to care for him ? We all need to know where this is headed . He especially needs to know . - It 's this simple . He 's one more human being that I 'm responsible for . And for me ... that 's one too many . - Or maybe he reminds you too much of Remy ? And that makes him intolerable , huh ? Shame on you . - Veena wants to raise the boy . - Remy will come for him sooner or later . - Lucas will protect him . - How do we know the boy wants protecting ? He 'll decide for himself if he wants to stay or go . It 's not a prison . - Yes , but still , he 's just . A. Boy . And Veena has wanted a child for so long . - Well , Veena knew what waiting would bring . Hoping Lucas would love him as she loves him . - And you have no compassion for her ? - I love my daughter , but I see things as they are . If the boy stays , there 's gonna be trouble . And a heartache for our daughter , because he will leave someday . - You 're so serious . I want you to hold me and dream for a while . But you are already so far , far away . - Am I so far away now ? Amelie ... we were on the Northern ice field this morning . The tremors have done a lot of damage . - How bad ? - The Northern clan ... - No , Lucas ... Remy 's wife . Those boys . - We have one survivor . Our boy . He won 't tell us his name . - My love , look at us . We 're all freezing to death . An entire village is gone , and still we fight . Isn 't that the worst kind of torture ? - what would you have me do ? - Unite us . We don 't have the resources . You know that . The stress on our food and medical supplies would put us all in jeopardy . It 'd be madness . - There are less defeating children now . - Even if these hardships could be overcome , some men are incapable of living in harmony . You know that . You sent me this warning of an impending attack . Is that not proof it 's impossible ? - Then you and I are stuck in the middle of this and we have nowhere to go . It 's hopeless . - No . Hey ... It 's not hopeless . We found something . At the village , buried deep within the ice , something more powerful than any of the ideas that you and I or anyone we know has ever had . It could end the freezing . And all the fighting and the hunger for revenge . We 're not stuck anywhere except within the limitations of our imagination . I have imagined so many outcomes for all of us over these many years . And now we have an opportunity to create change . So I hope you 'll agree there 's nothing hopeless about the nature of our love . It 's because of it that I feel anything is possible . - Your good heart is what keeps me from running to you each night . Because I know that patience is what will bring us together . All of us . - Jiro , get your father some water . - I have only one son . - What can I do ? - Embrace him . Tomorrow we fight . - Wait a while . You 've just returned . - My belly is burning now . - Mine as well ! But you 're tired ... I can see it in your eyes . You can 't do it all . I know they all think you can , but if you die , you are the life force of the clan . Without you ... - I will not fail . - I wish I had your strength and conviction . - You do . - I 've died so many small deaths in the past ten years . Ice has crept into my soul . And I 'm scared , because I feel I could kill if you place me at the death 's door . - Remember that feeling . One day it may save your life . Gather the clan . I have news . - What news , father ? - There will be no more waiting . - We fight ? I am ready , father . Let me fight at your side . - Do not let the glory of fighting blind you to the dangers of battle . The observatory is a weapon in itself . The ice , the cliffs ... It is like an eagle 's nest purged at the top of the world . - Yes , father . - We 're gonna fight together . We will wear them down until the nest can no longer be defended . - Thank you ... father I will make you proud . - Hey . - I 'm ... I 'm ... I 'm sorry . - No , that 's alright , that 's okay . - No harm done . Pick it up . Except that it 's all out of tune and that 's my fault . Here . Let me see it for a second . Okay . It 's gotta be in tune . Not bad . There we go . Okay . First finger goes here right next to the fret . Good . Good . Good . The other two go on there , One there . Now , you gotta hold it tight . You gotta treat the guitar kind of like a bird . You want to hold it tight enough so it doesn 't go away but not so tight that you hurt it . Okay . Let 's hear that . Nice . That 's great ! Okay , show me the next chord . Oh . Up two . There you go . There you go . Right . Ooh . Try that . How about the next chord ? Go up two more . Wanna know to know the way to a woman 's heart ? One note at a time . One more time . Every song ever written , every song that is going to be written , is in here and is in here . You just have to find it . Find your song . You are a natural . Ha , ha , ha . I think you should keep that on top . - Our brothers and our sisters in the norther clan , they 're gone . Remember them daily . Their struggles as ours are not worth any less in death . There is one survivor . A boy . And the Becks have him . We will take him back . We will show them that we can penetrate their forces . They will know that soon the observatory will be ours . - Yes ! - That is our right . This is our time ! - Yeah ! - And we ... - Yes ! - We will survive ! - Yeah ! - We 'll take them out ! - Take them out ! - Yeah ! - Take them out ! - Yeah ! - Yeah ! - Morning . - It 's been quiet . - Milo . - It 's vitamin C. It 'll keep the ... the scurvy from pulling the skin off your arms . - I know what vitamin C is . - Where 's David ? - David is in the dome trying to get satellite phone to work . He 's been at it all night . What 's your excuse ? - Hands . - Go ahead and give me your hand . - We are grateful for this food , for the work of many hands , and the sharing of life . We are the power that make this table whole . - Family . Honor . Health . - Boy , we 're all pleased to have you here and we want to express our regrets for your loss . You will always be safe . We will feed for you and care for you . Do you understand ? - Yes , thank you . - Do you have any idea how much trouble you 're gonna cause us ? I 'm just kidding . Come on , you can at least tell us your name . I mean , the Farnwells still name their kids , right ? - He acts like he 's some kind of prisoner of war . - Oh , come on , kid . This isn 't a gulag . - A ... a what ? - A gulag , a prison war camp . I read about it on one of David 's history books last winter before I burned it for fuel . He was pissed . - Oh , well , reading 's overrated anyway . So ... - Not if you want to learn a word like gulag . It 's definitely not . Is it ? - Okay . - Uh-huh . - Cristo . My name is Cristo . Everyone in our clan has a name . - Good to know , Cristo . Take this . You 're skinny . - Your personal vendetta puts us all at risk . - So this is about me , now , is it ? - The boy is safe . You 're not saving anyone . - Did Lucas tell you that , did he ? We all want this . - I know you promised to gas them out , they 'll have no means to survive . - Well my concern is my people , not the Becks . - So they 'll die ! - Yeah , very soon . - Then hear this . They found something that may save all of us . It 's buried beneath the ice and if you attack , you may destroy any chance we have of surviving . All of us , as a people . - So what have they found ? - Lucas called it a ... a jet plane . He said their was a president on it . - Do not undermine my efforts . There is more to this than just revenge . - They lied to us . - Who ? - The military commanders . Hell , everyone , even the president . They were predicting an ice age . They knew the comet was going to change our orbit . - David . Those people on the plane , did you know any of them ? - Yes , I did . The pilot . Colonel Charles Moore . When I first met Charlie , we called him Dr. Doom . His first big assignment was on Mayock 's doomsday jet . We all hated going up on that thing . Preempted strikes , retaliation strikes , didn 't really matter . Because you knew when you were landing you were a stranger in a strange land . I was on my way up here when Charlie took off with the president . He wished me luck . And here I am after all these years . Alive . And I didn 't even have the decency to step into the cockpit yesterday . - We need to do this , David . - There 's a good chance we will kill ourselves . Do you know that ? And I can 't be that guy . The one who screws up again . - David ... - No . Listen , you don 't understand . You don 't remember . You were just a kid . I had my a shot of saving humanity twenty-seven years ago . I screwed up . - You tried to shoot down a comet with a rocket that was built for a moon launch . It 's like lobbying a grenade at a fire jet . You blame yourself for missing ? - Yeah , I do . I live with it every day of my life and I should . - We 're not gonna screw this up . - Lucas , we don 't even have the football . - What do you mean football ? It 's a briefcase . It 's got the army codes in it . Even if I could get the satellite phone talking to the silos , we can 't detonate without those codes . - Did they say how long the freeze will last ? - Indefinitely . - Um ... you smell good . - Oh , you 've been up all night . - Hmm . - Temperature in the fish tank shouldn 't be below 54 . - What is it now ? - 52 . - I 'll fix the heat panel in the morning . - Mary was always good about that . Keeping the temperature just right . I 'm sorry . I broke our promise . - It 's alright . Just ... Mary was just so good with the fish . Even when she was a little girl . - Yes , any animal , really . And we couldn 't call them fish when we ate them , remember ? - That 's right . I remember . - Rita . She 's still with us . Right here . - I know . - And we have Milo . - Where 's Sam ? - Out on night watch . - You 're staying inside . Go ! - I don 't want them to take me . - I won 't let them . No ! No ! - What have you done to this boy ? He fights me ! - We 've made him feel welcome ! - Still saving the world one stray at a time , Veena . Hey , stay down ! Or I will hurt you . - No ! - Open the door ! - What ? No ' thank you ' ? How about ' where the hell have you been ' ? - Climb ! - Grab the rope , kid . I got you . I 'm swimming . - Give me your hand ! - No , Remy ! Don 't let go , Remy ! Don 't let go ! - Don 't do it ! The ledge is too far ! Don 't do it ! Remy , you 'll never make it ! - No ! No ! - It 's all here . - Yes , but he saw everything . - He 's dead . - Don 't count on that . - Veena . I 'm sorry about the boy . - We 're going back in the jet . We need the football . - I understand that . - The northern clan . - There 's nothing there . - In the ice mine . There was a plane , and the plane has a briefcase , it 's called the football . Find it . Bring it to me . - We 're looking for a soldier . The football should be attached to his wrist . - Damn it . - What are you doing ? - I don 't know . That 's good . Come on , try it . - Hmm . It tastes sweet , like honey . The man who makes this is a general in the army . Mills . - That 's it . That 's the door to the cockpit . - Okay . - Nothing in here . - We gotta get out of here ! Now ! It 's collapsing ! - Look out ! Milo ! Veena ! Look out , Rick ! - Let 's go ! - I 'm okay , I 'm coming . - Where 's Milo ? Veena , where 's Milo ? - I don 't know ! - Milo ! - I 'm right here . Let 's go ! - Come on ! Come on ! We gotta get out of here . - Come on ! We can 't hold the door ! - Let 's go ! - Let 's go , let 's go ! - Hold on , we 're coming ! We 're coming ! - Milo ! Veena ! - Where 's the ax ? - So the boy has been reunited with his aunt . - Was it worth the blood we spilled ? - If I have his loyalty , well worth it . You made me very proud today . - Thank you , father . - If you ever need something ... - I saw the equipment they took from the jet . I don 't know what it 's capable of . Just as I know that Lucas and William do not have the unity or the resolve to use it . I do . - What exactly is he capable of ? - Power like you can never imagine . Heat . Warmth at last . I 'm going back into the observatory and I 'm gonna take it all . - You don 't have the resources . Louis and Ignacio are gone . - I have enough men if you tell me your secret . Lucas told you how to circumvent the defenses . - You had me followed ? - When I was at the Nordel clan , You visited him . You see , I know the smell of a warm stone room . Especially one that used to be mine . You tell me how to get in and out and no one gets hurt . Otherwise , blood will be spilled . That is the cost and it 's on your head . There 's just no time for waiting . We live or die by this moment . - I can track it from the surface . - That 's a subterranean river . Anything in it 's gonna follow the glacial float until we get to the flat lines . - Look for uplifts in the ice . That 's the only chance the jet has to surface . - Now listen to me . The fuselage is air tight . Right now they 're alive . They 're alive . Now go . Go ! - Milo ! Milo ! - Where are the others ? - Milo ? - Sam , how are we gonna find them out in this storm ? They 're not gonna make it . - Don 't say that . - Now , come on . Look at it out there . What chance do they have ? - Do you think that your wife Mary would have given up ? Huh ? Her own son ? - She gave up when she died . - She never gave up and never will you . I remember when Milo was born . You wouldn 't let anybody touch him but her . You two would lay there in the bed in the middle of you one heart beating together . You remember that , right ? That 's what you said . One heart . That 's why you 're never gonna give up . Not on Milo . That 's why you won 't give up on any of us . - Okay . Okay . - We have a conversation . The satellite phone is talking to the silos . - I 've only been scared a handful of times in my life and I gotta tell you . This terrifies me . - You don 't think I 'm scared ? I can 't sleep , I haven 't eaten , I 've got to get this one right . What choice do we have , William ? - Kovita ! Kovi , where are you ? Oh my God . Water . There 's a leak . - I was so scared . - Oh , me too . Now come on . We gotta find some place safe . Go quick ! It 's right here . - We 're gonna die , aren 't we ? - No , we 're not . Eat this . The calories will keep you warm . - What 's the point ? - To stay alive ! Look , we can survive this thing . - Just please , keep telling me that , Milo , because I can 't imagine how . - You can start by eating the centers . Kovita ! Kovita ! Come on ! No , no , no ... breathe . Breathe breathe Come on ! Breathe ! - You didn 't have to take the kids with you . - Fred , don 't . - No , I will say whatever I feel . My daughter is on that jet . You were responsible for her ! - Are you forgetting that my grandson is out there on that jet too ? - Lucas will save them . - He 's one man on the ice with Sam . They don 't stand much of a chance . - Hell ! - So you 're giving up on him . Should my sons just quit and come home , it 's all a waste ? They 're efforts are hopeless , all of our plans , the football ... Why don 't we just turn over the observatory to the Farnwell while we 're at it , Fred ? Why fight for anything ? - Wait ? - No , no , no ... he needs to hear this . he needs to feel this . My boys will never give up . I 'm gonna go outside right now . I 'm gonna take my ship . if the Farnwells attack , then I 'll do what I 've always done . I will protect our home , my family , everyone of you . Yes , you , too , Fred , I would die for you . Would you die for me ? - We got to get moving before the jet gets too far ahead of us . - Which way do you think east is ? - Come on ! Breathe ! Come on ! Come on ! Breathe . Sam ! - Where ? - There . - Please tell me I 'm okay ! - You 're totally fine . You 're just tired , and hungry , and ... and thirsty and exhausted . - Why are you smiling ? - You gotta get up . Come on . It 's okay . We 're okay . We 're gonna make it . - Well , I think I 'm gonna have to take it off at the Metatarsus phalangeal joint . - Meaning ? - The ... uh ... joint closest to the forefoot here . Mama , I 'm sorry . - Veena , you did everything you could . Diabetes is a merciless disease under these conditions . - I want you to bite down on this . Be quick to cauterize . - Remy ! You have no idea what you 're dealing with here ! - I 'm not taking anything that isn 't rightfully mine . You found this under my village . - She 'll kill him ! - Oh , my people can move . We 'll be far away . But you , here in the observatory , how safe will you be ? Wanna stop me ? You have five seconds . Make your move or I 'll make it for you . - Oh , David . You taught me to box . Did you forget ? And the kids would laugh , when you would flake me with that jab-like cross . - David , I 've got the two extra batteries for you . David ! David ? David ! Hey , hey ! - He got it all . I 'm sorry , William . I 'm so , so sorry . - I have a question . How did Remy know how to open and unlock the shield ? - Amalie . She was here . Two nights ago . She knew how to bypass our defenses . - You knew this and said nothing ? - Hey , she told Remy . - No . - Why wouldn 't she ? She 's your sister . - She loves Lucas . - You think Remy wouldn 't find a way to get that from her ? - She betrayed my son 's trust . - We have to go after him . - And leave the observatory unprotected ? I don 't think so . - So you would wait for Lucas and Sam to return ? - And you have that little faith in their ability to do so ? - I 'm realistic . - So I guess that also means you 've given up on your daughter ? - I haven 't given up on any of them . - You listen to me , Fred . They 're gonna make it . They 're gonna survive. they 're coming back . You will see your daughter again . But the hardest thing I 'll ever do is explain to my son that it was the woman he loves that betrayed him . - Keep , keep your eyes open . Keep your eyes open . Hey , hey . Keep them up . Don 't close them . - I love you , Milo . - I love you , too . - Love ... I mean I would 've spent every last day of my life with you . - I know . Me too . - Right there . Right there ! - Alright . - No . - Kovita ? - Milo ! Milo ! - Kovita ! - Milo ! - Milo ? - Sam ? Sam ! - Now we have our chance . - We still need to find the football . - I think I know where it is . It was right here . - They must have been following us the whole time . - We 're gonna be moving fast . - I 'm ready . - I know you are . - You gotta come and see this ! The earth is recapturing its orbit . - The tremors . It 's all because of this . - We 're saved . - We 'll see . - The Farnwells Know nothing of this . They 'll have the army codes . They 'll use them . Father . We 're not going with you . - Everything 's changing . It 's five degrees warmer here and down there , who knows ? - We can go farther than ever . There 's a corridor to the east . Just think of the potential . The resources we might find ! - for how long ? - As long as it takes . - And what if all of this doesn 't last and the freeze returns down to the Great Plains ? How will you get back to us ? - Father , I will always find you . I 'd have to . - We 'll be alright .

 What happened up to now on : SPACE PILOT . Look at the floor , it 's a mess ! Mr. Tichy ... I 'd appreciate more respect . - You 're joking ! I wanted an egg , and the problem started ! The void has returned . We 're all gonna die . It 's the end of the universe . But I 've prepared a primeval soup ... which needs to be shot through the cosmo-gigantic cannon into the void . It worked , I saved the universe ! What did you just say ? You saved the universe ? I did all the work ! This is my assistant Mel . You ruffian ! You really know every corner of the universe ? And ... - What 's going on here ? I had a stowaway ! What 're you doing under my sofa bed ? - I don 't know what I am ... What kind of individual . - Tarantoga treats him like a slave . No one can tell me what planet I come from . These plant-remains were on my feet when I came to Tarantoga . It 's the only clue to my heritage . The worst thing was that I had no more eggs . My stomach was grumbling ! So I was on my way to the Egg Planet ... at the other end of the galaxy ! SPACE PILOT The Star Diaries Not this planet either ... Freely produced by themes from the novel " Star diaries " by Stanislaw Lem Mr. Tichy , we 're almost there . The Egg Planet can 't be far . My belly 's growling ! My knees are turning to jelly ! Didn 't we agree I 'd keep the kitchen clean and you 'd tidy up the control room ? Keep your eyes on the road ! I live here too . I 'm not letting you out until you do what we agreed . Ok , if that 's what you want , I 'll stick to my end of the deal . Her kitchen ... I 'll never find my home planet . APPEARANCE AND REALITY PART I Here you go . Your kitchen ... your problem ! Hey , someone beamed some melted stuff to the kitchen . Mr. Tichy , I 'm gonna leave your rocket . What ? - My journey is over . It seems I have no home planet . We haven 't found a single clue to my heritage or my race . According to the Encyclopedia ... I don 't even exist . That 's why I 'm going back ... to where I have a permanent place and a function ... to Professor Tarantoga . To that old couch fart ? Let 's make a deal . From now on your function is to clean this room . You get to stay and have the right to use the sleep-nest ! No ! Hello ? Mr ... Tichy ? This Tarantoga was sneaky ! If he got my name right ... it meant he had a cat up his sleeve . What do you want ? - Mr. Tichy , a very good day to you . How are you doing ? I just wanted to see if you were hungry ? Send my regards to the pretty Mrs. Tichy ... Why are you being so friendly nice ? I have a spare egg . I thought you might be interested , hm ? Dr. Spamy could teleport it to you right away . An egg ? What do you want in return ? What I want ? My assistant Mel back ! Dammit ! This dumb-twit didn 't know ... that the Mel-fellow wanted to go back anyway . I don 't know . Just one egg ? Ok , two eggs . Let me see ... Alright , I 'll do it ! Two eggs to send the Mel-fellow back , ok ? It 's a deal ! Then beam those two eggs to that Tootly ! Tichy ! A wonderful , green landscape ... with nice people and lots of trees . That 's how I always imagined my home planet . Listen , these plants and earth are proof that your planet is out there somewhere . You came through the teleporter . You had to get in somewhere ! We 'll find your planet ! What 's that ? - An egg ! Melted into a blob ? - Our cosmic hero must have forgotten ... not to put separate things into the same teleporter ! Fair punishment for being so infinitely presumptuous ! Only one egg ? That lying cheat ! Waiting for the water to boil , I tried , with the second teleporter ... to separate my melted clothes . On the other side of my kitchen ... That really went well . You 're almost brilliant ! You have a better idea ? I came to say good-bye . - Mel ? Something keeps drawing me back to Tarantoga . I can 't resist . It seems I belong there . But I would like to thank you for the exiting voyage to the ... Egg Planet ! What ? I had just wrecked the Egg Planet ! The void-hole was inside , and started wiping out the universe again ! Eh , Tushly ! Where 's Mel ? Dammit ! Spamy beamed you the eggs . You dumb-loser , don 't know nothing about nothing . The void-hole is back , it was hiding inside the Egg Planet ! The void is back ? Impossible ! I shot a new evolution and legitimized the universe . You can 't even count to two ... eggs . I can too , you lousy crash pilot ! - One arm bandit ! What ? I won 't allow a back-seat driver like you to speak to me like that ! I gonna beam myself to your rocket and pick Mel up in person . And punch you in the eye . One arm will do ! Where 's that loudmouth hero ? - Professor ! Mel ! Pack your bags , you 're coming to the institute with me , now ! You deserved it . You should treat Mel with more respect . He 's only human , after all . What ? The Professor ! In my rocket ! Put your dukes up , you big mouth . I don 't believe this . I knew you were a lousy little cowar ... It 's bigger than I thought . The universe is dissolving ! Tarantoga and Tichy , such ... show-offs ! Come on . Let 's get back at them . Two birds with one stone . Off to Tarantoga ! And now ? We 'll send this teleporter in that one to Tarantoga . Otherwise , Tichy will keep beaming stuff back and forth in the rocket . Who 's the pants-pooper now , huh ? What 's this ? A teleporter in a teleporter ... A feedback or something ? Where are you going ? - I wanna go home ! The cosmos is ending , we don 't have a solution . Go fire your cannon , shoot some and primeval soup stuff into the void-hole . That didn 't do the trick last time , either ! Ok , it 's better than nothing ! Where did he go ? Hey , Tarantoga , where are you ? Dr. Spamy ? What happened to your ugly trunk-thing , huh ? Where is that scaredy-rat Tarantoga ? - He jumped in there ... What 's that ? Some kind of feedback ... Tarantoga disappeared in there ! - What ? Hello ? Now I had a problem . The Professor had disappeared ... into a weird teleporter hole ... So who was gonna shoot the cannon at the void-hole now ? There was only one solution . - Hold this ! I 'm going down the wet-water-wall ... to look for that jackass professor . And you 're gonna help me ! You 're gonna rope me down . Mr. Tichy ... Mel 's a bit small for this job , maybe I should do it ? You are now responsible for the rocket . You are my substitute representative . But only till I get back . Got that ? Sure . All set to go ? - Yeah ... Let do it ! It doesn 't seem to go far . He 's coming back soon ... isn 't he ? Mel ! Oh no ! Mr. Tichy ! Is this possible ? Mel-Fellow ! - Mr. Tichy ! Tarantoga ! - You have to save me ! Please ! The brave professor , huh ? Welcome to my fun little vacation adventure ! Ok , I 'm a coward . You win . Just get me outta here ! Getting eaten by animals is a totally new experience for me . Happens to me all the time . Let 's take the back way out . Trying to leave me behind , huh ? I wanna hide behind my desk again . Stop whining and tell us what you know about this place ? Two teleporters coupling could 've opened up a wormhole . A wormy hole ? A wormhole is a short cut through a dimension . We could be anywhere ! I think I know ! What ? We 're being excreted ! Oh no , I 'm in charge ... I 'm in charge , I have to do something ... Dr. Spamy ? Miroslav , we need to take charge . Prove our qualities ! You have to shoot the cannon into the void ! Miroslav , you like me , don 't you ? You want to earn recognition and respect , don 't you ? Alright . Then go to the cannon . Come on , Dr. Spamy ... Do it ! This is it ! I 'm home . On my home planet ! What did you just say ? This earth ... the type of plants ... it all fits ! It 's proof that I 'm home . Hello ! Now I remembered : When Mel was beamed to Tarantoga ... he had that plant-stuff on his feet ... and no memory of where he came from . It can 't possibly be Mel 's planet . It 's just not . Hello ? Anybody home ? Somebody like me ? Hello , it 's me ! Mel ! We don 't have time for this . The cosmos is being wiped out . This planet as well . Let 's go ! Nobody 's there . I 'll walk behind you ... Come on ... Oh , how sweet ! What 's that ? How disgusting ! What 's that ? Go away . Hello ! Is anybody there ? Who looks like me ? Hello , I 'm back ! Well , Mel , it looks like no one 's here . I 'm certain this is not your planet . It is , I 'm sure of it . I 've come to the end of my search , Professor . I 'll meet my people soon . They 're just hiding ... Mel , that 's ridiculous and you know it ! Maybe they 're just shy , like me ! Dammit , Mel ! You 're never going to find your planet . It doesn 't exist . What ? How can you say that ? You don 't know that ! Enough of this . You belong with me at the Institute , and that 's that ! You may be right . There 's no one here . Oh no ! What is that ? Don 't even try hiding ! Looks like this planet does have something to do with you . It 's not possible ... This is not how I imagined it ! Tell me what is going on here ? What ... Why is his name there ? Where are we ? You know something you 're not telling me . Okay ... I admit it , I know exactly where this wormhole has led us . Listen Mel , it 's like this ... I can 't hold on with just one arm . Professor ! - It 's your fault , Mel ! What is my fault ? Mel-fellow ! Not me ! TO BE CONTINUED ... What 's this ?

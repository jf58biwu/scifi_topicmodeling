 Previously on Caprica ... I 'm stuck in V-World , and neither Tamara nor I can leave . I remember you from the dark room , Tamara . I know how scared you are . We 're nothing alike . New Cap City is disgusting ! I have a purpose . I think you 're supposed to help me . Imagine a world in which death has been conquered . Praise the one true God . Only they will savor life everlasting in a virtual heaven that we have built . My plan for Apotheosis has been put into motion , but I have to overcome some obstacles . My GDD contact tells me you have a spy in your house . I have a CI . I knew it . Read it , shred it . Don 't speak of it , don 't log it into an e-sheet . I can 't have this woman burned . She trusts me . You hear they fished a floater from the Theoresos ? I had nothing to do with this . I 've been asked by the GDD to spy on Clarice . I can 't let them catch me eavesdropping again . If you could get me a camera or a bug , I could plant it in Clarice 's room . Okay . I 'll get you the tick . We 've taken over Graystone Industries , but I don 't agree with the Guatrau 's decisions . You think my decision to sell your robots off-world was stupid . Tell me that Guatrau will change his mind . Tell me they 're going home to our people . STO . Oh , nice . Those robots could turn this entire rebellion around . Give our people the firepower that they need . Your obsession with the old world is a distraction . It ends here . He 's a very ambitious man . But you 're right not to trust him . We 're killing him ? Do it quietly , Samuel . Big advisor to the Guatrau . How 's it feel ? Terrible . Crippled with guilt , of course . I 'm not happy . I 'm not happy about arming the STO , or about this Graystone move . Graystone ? Well , he 's not our enemy . He 's been doing everything we 've asked him to do , and still we 're gonna take him out ? He doesn 't deserve to have his throat cut . Sure he does . We all do . Look , first of all , he knew exactly what he was getting into , and second , you can 't stop it . Today 's about you and me getting promoted , a promotion , by the way , I helped set up for you . Yeah , don 't do me any favors . Ah , good . Everyone 's here . Guatrau . Such men . I found these two at a refugee orphanage . Perhaps I should say they found me . This one tried to pick my pocket . I knew right then he had the stones to become one of us . And this one . Always with the eyes , always calculating something . And now they make me proud , as if I were their father . I 'm so pleased . Today one of them joins us , and the other one becomes a leader of men . You will lead us as you have been led . You , my ... I 'm so happy this day is finally here . You 've earned your mark . - Ha 'la 'tha . - Ha 'la 'tha . This is the skivvy malanos your grandfather passed down to me . He used it to give me my mark of manhood . A mark of faithfulness to the soil . Yoseef . Today you will get your mark of manhood . You have done well to earn it , learning the ancient prayers and passages of the Sacred Scrolls . Yoseef , I seem to have forgotten my robes . Can you find them for me ? Samuel . Allow your brother his day . He needs this . You two are different . Your brother , he feels things on the inside , but you ? A blind man could see how you feel . The very first day I held you in my arms , I knew you were a man . Then I should get a mark , too . Allow your brother his day . Your day will come . Go see what 's taking your brother so long . I was out in the fields . Trucks full of Heraclides troops are coming in . Must be a reprisal . I was against blowing up their grain silos for this very reason . They oppress us . They should pay . We have to be more careful . People are desperate and hungry , and our neighbors would turn us in for a sack of bread . It 's time . They need to know . Do you know how your grandparents returned to the soil ? With pride . Fighting for what they believed in . Like other Adamas before them , they decided , on their own terms , how they would return to the soil . Your father and I are no different , and when an Adama starts a fight , we finish it one way or another . But not everyone lives by our rules . Like the Heracs . Yes , Yoseef . It 's the reason for this . Kapi . It will return you to the soil . We have knowledge of the Ha 'la 'tha resistance . If we are ever caught by the Heracs , they will try to make us reveal those secrets . And they 'll use you against us . This will keep our secret safe . Do you understand ? You have always been my little Adama men . Time now to be men of Tauron . Ah , they 're back ! Avenging Angels here to clean up New Cap City . Defend yourselves or take off your bands . I don 't think we need this in our world , do you ? Let 's just clean it . It 's about time . I was getting worried they weren 't gonna show . Let 's kill them . Right behind you . Thought you 'd never make it . You look nothing like Zoe Graystone . Whoever programmed you was a hack . What 's so funny ? They won 't be laughing long . They 're frakking cheating ! Don 't you know the rules ? No packing heat in Slash Cut . This is New Cap City . There are no rules . Frak , frak , frak , frak , frak ! You should 've ducked . What , and duck out like you did , you coward ? Come on . You know damn well I 've been working on my avatar for the last five years . I can 't believe I can never go back into New Cap City . Looks like you have to find a new game to play . Frakking Avenging Angels . You both finished playing that ridiculous game ? And I thought I asked you to pack up all of Mar-Beth 's personal things . Send it out with the trash . No , we 're keeping them for the baby , who 's still a part of this family . And then , we 're gonna think up a good story to tell him when he 's old enough . Yeah , well , what are we gonna tell Terror Mom ? Um ... That Mar-Beth couldn 't handle being a mother , so she left . I mean , some people just aren 't cut out to be a parent , are they ? And can you just show a little bit more respect to Amanda ? Yeah . Fine . Whatever . You 're the boss . Yeah . Remember that . You know , a little banding might work off some of that stress . I mean , you really should meet the Avenging Angels there . Yeah , they ... They 'd love you . And you 'd love them . I mean , one of them 's even playing dress-up with Zoe Graystone 's avatar . Get your priorities straight . What 's wrong with your boss ? He must know science doesn 't work on a timetable . Two weeks is an unreasonable deadline . Come on , Graystone . I thought we were gonna box . Resurrection technology will work . It 'll change the worlds . You cannot allow him to let this opportunity get away . You 're just swinging blindly . Come on , Daniel ! Learn your opponent 's tendencies . If he 's stronger than you , move , so he can 't hit you . Okay ? If he 's faster than you , tie him up . Come on , come on , go for me ! No , no , no . Find your opponent 's weakness , and then attack him there , or he will kill you . Think about it . Come on , Daniel . Fight . Samuel Adama , orphan refugee from Tauron . Multiple arrests , ranging from misdemeanor petty thefts to gambling , assault , battery , and extortion . Native Taurons are a proud , passionate race . A loyal and storied culture in which family ties are secondary only to personal honor . Thirty years ago , the Tauron uprising began when poorly-armed native rebel forces , known as the Ha 'la 'tha , attacked the presidential barracks , initiating a two-year civil war . In the aftermath , the victorious Heraclides forces attempted a genocide by using murder squads , commonly referred to as " Heracs . " Facing extinction , the Ha 'la 'tha transformed to becoming an illegal underground organization throughout the 12 Colonies . Search the Guatrau 's shell company , Obulis Inc . Obulis is a Leonis corporation with holdings across the 12 Colonies . Caprican Securities Service has recently dropped two investigations of the company dealing with allegations of insider trading . Show me recent mergers and acquisitions . Ah , show me the status of those companies . Show me status of the CEOs . That is an old likeness of you , Daniel . Would you like me to update the image ? Following the seizure of a massive shipment of Sagittaron arms bound for rebel forces on Tauron , Foreign Minister Kristoff used strong words today , saying that , " The successful Tauron army operation " proves that we will soon be returning " these insurgents to their homes . " Defense Minister Patel confirmed today that no Caprican troops will be sent to Tauron in peace-keeping efforts , stating that , " We haven 't been asked for our help yet . " While here at home , entrepreneurs jumped to capitalize on the Avenging Angels phenomenon . Sam , what 's going on ? Don 't go out there . Come back ! You shouldn 't have taken that . You 're afraid of everything . Look who lost his limo . Out of your neighborhood , Capa ? May I speak with you for a moment ? Man 's got attachments . You gotta appreciate that . Taurons have always intrigued me . Your loyalties to one another , to your colony . As opposed to you Capa fraks . Don 't care about skor , no tradition , no ethos . I meant no offense . Mmm-hmm . Just looking to understand better the people I 'm in bed with ... Well , my appreciation for you is wearing off . You don 't like Capricans , do you ? That ink there . Isn 't that the mark of an assassin ? It 's gonna be you , isn 't it ? Me what ? Are you gonna use the knives ? Or are you gonna take me for a drive somewhere ? You 're losing me here , Graystone . When is it going to happen ? Right after I hand in the resurrection program , or will you wait a few days ? Nothing could be further from the Guatrau 's mind . We 're not animals , you know . More than just a Ha 'la 'tha proverb ? Your pronunciation needs some work . So , what , so we 're gonna take steams together now ? Do lunch ? Yeah ? You coming at me this way like you 're my friend ? Why do you follow this particular Guatrau ? What 's that supposed to mean ? Well , you despise Capricans . He is a pure Caprican . He 's no more Tauron than I am . See , that kind of talk ... That does get you killed . He is selling Cylons for profit to the STO , and he knows the difference one unit would make for the resistance on Tauron . Just one for his people . For his soil . You know what they 're capable of . Imagine a single soldier robot fighting for your cause . The cause that your parents ... Hey , hey ! You know frak about my parents ! No , I don 't . But I 'd be surprised if they put profit above the good of their own people . Listen . I can help you . Help Tauron . I have the codes , back-door access to the mainframe , and a private transport . The Guatrau will never know . You 're not exactly an " out of the goodness of your heart " kind of guy . I 've done my research . I know how this ends for me . Even if what you 're implying is true , which I 'm not saying it is , what makes you think I could do something about it ? You just got your horns inked . It 's a big promotion . Quid pro quo . I give you Cylons , and you find a way to keep me alive . I haven 't seen you use this since law school . I thought maybe ... I didn 't smoke much until a few months ago . I didn 't really need to . Hey . What ? I never noticed that before . Let me see . It 's nothing . What ? Is it the Guatrau ? He 's not sending any cubits to Tauron ? It 's not the time . I 'm just saying , you have the Guatrau 's ear now . He will listen to you . Yeah ? About what ? Tauron ? Yes . The only loyalties he has is to cubits . That 's why he 's able to just ... Hey . What 's bothering you ? Come on . He 's selling Cylons to the Gods-damned STO terrorists . The same terrorists who killed my little girl . My wife . My family . I 'm sorry . It just didn 't even occur to me . I was just thinking of Tauron . Stay calm . Who is it ? Open the door , or lose it . Get the boys out . Go . Hide at the meeting place . We 'll join you . Why so long opening the door ? I didn 't have any pants on . Couldn 't answer the door in my bedclothes . We 've interrupted your breakfast , I see . Where 's the rest of your family ? Out to play . You know boys , they can 't sit still for a minute . We ... We don 't want any trouble . So you stay out of things , huh ? Maybe you can help us then . Did you hear anything last night ? No , we 're pretty sound sleepers . - Nothing ? - No . One of our brothers-in-arms was murdered just outside this building last night , and not a single dirt-eater heard a Gods-damn thing . My hearing isn 't so good . The machinery in the fields ... You heard that okay . Lieutenant . Oh . - Here you go . - Thank you . Jordan . Can I speak to you ? I 'm busy . It 's not a request . You know , I am sick of the pleasantries . We both know you 're dirty , Gara . And as soon as I get the proof , I 'm gonna bring you down . Well , you should . I 'm a firm believer if you have proof , you should use it . What 's with the IA rat tail ? He 's here as a witness . Oh , yeah ? Witness to what ? You lost a confidential informant . I gave you my CI . Well , no . If you recall , I asked for your CI 's identity to prevent exactly what happened to that poor woman , but you denied it . I handed you Mar-Beth Willow 's file . Okay , look , I admit I bear some of the responsibility for this . Maybe I pushed you too hard for results . We were all scared by the MagLev bombing . But it 's an important lesson for all of us . We can 't cut corners . We can 't circumvent procedure . We can 't use the GDD for our own personal vengeance . It wasn 't vengeance , and I followed procedure , to the " T. " If it was just me , I would take you at your word . But it 's in the hands of Internal Affairs . They have this . I 've given you a lot of leeway on this case . And I have never divulged the identity of an active CI , not to anyone . I need the jackets for any and all informants you have in the field . No , sir . And until I get that , you don 't get so much as a paper clip . Believe it or not , you work for me . I work for Caprica . Where 's the part I gave you Mar-Beth 's file ? You might not want to say anything until you 've had a chance to confer with counsel . Frak this . I hate to do this , but I gotta take your badge and gun . You 're off-duty until the investigation of Mar-Beth Willow 's death is complete . Now , I will stay on top of this personally . Global Defense Department . Hello , can I speak to Agent Jordan Duram , please ? Hold one moment . Miss , Agent Duram no longer works at the GDD . I can connect you to Agent Youngblood , she 's taking over all of his cases . Where did you get the gun ? You know where . You planted it . Maybe your wife can tell me . No ! Isabelle ! All you have to do is give me the names of your dirt-eater friends . No ? Okay , then . Isabelle . Stop it ! You stop it ! Isabelle ! Isabelle ! Isabelle ! Isabelle ! No ! Samuel , no . Sam , stop . My knees are ruined . I won 't be able to walk . Samuel . Get me the kapi . Go . We don 't have much time . Go . Take your brother and go . Go ! Go . Will you stop this madness ? You stop this madness ! We have done nothing wrong ! We live a peaceful life . We have done nothing wrong . Things change . Excuse me . Excuse me . Where do you get that T-shirt ? I don 't know . They 're selling them everywhere . I 'll buy it off you for 100 cubits . You 're Daniel Graystone . Oh , my Gods , you 're Daniel Graystone . I am . All right , I 'm your biggest fan . Thank you . Sometimes when I wear the band for more than four hours , I start to hear this whirring sound . You ever get that ? It gives me a real migraine . I 'll be sure to look into that . Cool . Hey , you know how those Holo-haters say that banding causes brain damage ? I band 24l7 . I 'm totally gravy . You know that 's not really your daughter , right ? That 's an avatar . Oh , man . Oh , yeah , they 've been hitting this area of New Cap . These days , much of my clientele are here to kill them , or be killed by them . Either way you 're famous , right ? There they are now . Come on . Zoe . Zoe ! Wait ! Wait your turn . Hey , I want to talk to you . Hey ! There 's a line . I can 't believe he found us . How ? It 's this Avenging Angels thing . People are coming in to fight us . They must be talking about it in the real world . Like king of the mountain . Just a sport to them . We can just get out of this game . We can go and get lost in V-World . I mean , it 's massive . He 'll never find us . No . It 's safer in New Cap City . We 're gods in here . Let 's act like it and forsake these motherfrakkers . We can build a place where nobody will be able to touch us . What ? What ? It 's just ... It 's just all wrong . Well , we worked really hard on it . Yeah , and I expect Zeus to come wandering from behind the columns to congratulate you . It 's too traditional . These people have just given up their lives to the one true God . They 've just died . And they 're opening their eyes to life everlasting , and it 's got to be ... Look , they 'll be able to create any kind of virtual terrain they desire . Yes , I know that everybody 's going to be able to create their own heaven , but first of all , they 're going to see this , what we 've created , and it 's got to ... It 's got to glorify God , it 's got to be Soaring arches and stained-glass windows and statues built into the walls ... Statues of who ? Um , well , of ... Of those of us that were there at the beginning , it 's ... It 's going to be beautiful . What were you thinking ? The captain gave you the codes to get this out of here ? Yeah , yeah . Just one code at a time . You don 't get to be the richest man in the Colonies by giving it away . That 's true . He 's coming . Frak . How close ? Close . All right , stall him for me . I need a couple minutes , all right ? Okay . Let 's go . You good ? One sec . Hey , pops . Hey . What are you doing here ? Just looking for you and your theos . Oh , it 's cool . I thought I told you to stay in the upstairs offices . It 's boring up there . Hey , I was thinking . We could maybe go fishing again . Like last time . You hated it . What ? No . It was great . What do you think ? How about tomorrow ? It 's time to go home . Are you ever going to tell me what 's going on ? What ? Just having a drink with my brother . Don 't frak with me . I know . I know , Samuel . Crossing the Guatrau . I 've got ink now . We 'll both be held accountable . Do you have any idea how crazy this is ? Hmm ? You 're putting everyone you care about at risk . It 's what our parents fought for . There is blood in the soil over this , Yoseef . I don 't need a history lesson . Maybe you do . Because maybe you could stand around and watch this happen all over again , but I can 't . I know you wanted to protect them . I know . Sara Frenel . Sara Frenel . You said that name already . I want another name . Do it . Sam , you have to . You know I 'll find your children . Just give me the names of your dirt-eater friends and this will all end for you . Shoot now . Please . You did it , Yoseef . You did it . Yoseef . We don 't have much time . It 's okay . Send me to the soil . Make me proud . Go now . Run ! I 'm ready , Yoseef . There is no other way . Down here ! Ah , Sam . Can 't change the past , Sam . No . But I finally found a way to avenge it . If I don 't continue our parents ' fight , their return was for nothing . It wasn 't your fault . How could you have known what was going to happen when you brought the gun back ? We were just boys . Yeah . You should have come to me , Sam . You gotta be smart . What ? We bear this pain together . I forgot who I was . I forgot who I am . Made promises . You 're with me ? I 'm your brother . I 'm always with you . If we 're gonna go up against the Guatrau , we 're gonna have to do it together . Ha 'la 'tha means " Always faithful to the soil . " There 's something we gotta be more faithful to . Mother said there 's nothing ... We choose our own path . We 'll be faithful to each other as Adamas . I 'm sorry . Traffic was awful . What the hell happened to your face ? Daniel , what ? Zoe 's alive . What ? She 's ... You 're talking about the avatar , yes ? No . It 's not ... It 's not that simple . It 's our daughter . What do you mean ? You said that ... I know . I know . I thought she was gone . The program crashed . She was gone , and now ... I ... I don 't understand it myself , but she 's in there . I 've seen her . You 've seen her ? She 's in V-World . I want to see her . Well , let 's go find her .

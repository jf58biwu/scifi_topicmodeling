 This is what Destiny intended from the moment it entered the star system . We are going to survive . We are going to make it home . I 'm telling you , the ship came here for a reason . Destiny is powered by the stars themselves . He and Young are bumping heads , yes . Not sure which camp is the better choice . We just pretend nothing happened . We need to be ready for the next encounter . For the sake of the crew . For the sake of the crew . Well , the convulsions have stopped , but he 's completely unresponsive . He 's basically in a deep catatonic state . This is Scott , sir . We are in a bit of a pickle down here . We haven 't found any other sort of exit or access to ground level . We 've got less than half an hour . We 're not going to make it . They just jumped . God be with you , Colonel . All of you . Colonel Young ? Colonel Young ? Yeah . We 're all here , sir . I 'm on my way . Dr. Rush has just confirmed that our current FTL jump will take us between galaxies . Which means it could take some time before we are able to make another gate connection to replenish our supplies . Strict food and water rationing will be reinstated as of now . It also means , that any hope of rescuing Chloe Armstrong , Eli Wallace , or Lt. Matthew Scott is ... Colonel Young , would you please join me in the control interface room ? I 'll be right there . That is all . I 've figured out . Why the ship 's been trying to conserve power . We 're going to fall short . Short of what ? Our destination , the other galaxy . No matter how I do the sums , and to what degree I try and conserve power , Destiny won 't make it across the void . But we just passed through a star . We should be recharged . Yes , we did , but like everything else on this ship , Destiny 's FTL drive and power reserves are nowhere near 100 % . The database says the ship barely made the last three or four intergalactic jumps . Recent battle damage couldn 't have helped . But if the ship realizes that it can 't make it , why is it trying ? It 's programmed to follow a predetermined path . Since we haven 't managed to take control of the ship , our presence is secondary to that . Destiny will eventually drift the rest of the way , but our bones will be dust by then . So , what do we do ? Well , I 'm open to suggestions . How much will we fall short ? 50,000 light years , give or take . Just a few percent of the total . Yeah . So , what if we can increase the FTL drive 's efficiency ? Work better with the same amount of power . Yeah , five percent would do it , actually . We don 't know how the engines work , at all . We could just make things worse . Mr. Brody 's right . So am I the only one here who thinks . We shouldn 't be screwing around with ancient drive technology . Unless we have a clue about what we 're doing ? Then we 'll bring aboard someone else that does . I can think of two or three people off the top of my head . Who 's the best ? Amanda Perry . She was part of the team helping to design the next generation of hyperdrives . There 's really no one better qualified . Well , let 's make that happen . Let 's make arrangements to get her on board . Colonel ... For all her abilities , there are certain disabilities of which you should be made aware . For how long ? Potentially several weeks . Of course , there 'll be someone to assist with the day to day things . She requires a respirator in order to breathe . Obviously , there 's going to be some kind of adjustment . Will I be able to see my family ? They 've got clearance . Then I 'll do it , sir . Lieutenant ? You all right ? Mandy ... Nick . Yeah . God , I 'm really here , aren 't I ? You sure are . It takes a moment . To get used to the transfer . You 're telling me . I 'm sorry , sir . I couldn 't do it . Lieutenant ... Just leave her . Leave her . So Lieutenant James had trouble . Getting used to the ventilator . I 'll be fine . Fix the ship . Ms. Wray ? Yes . Good . Take all the time you need to adjust . This is Mary . She 'll be your helper while you 're here . Hello . She 'll also brief you on how to cope with your host 's disabilities . Afterwards , Dr. Strom was hoping to see you ... No . I 'm going home . Hey ... I couldn 't do it . Yeah , I know . I heard . It 's okay . No , it isn 't . I let him down . The Colonel ? Hey , listen , he 's the last person that ... I recognize you . Excuse me . As I was saying , this is the mess hall , one of the places you probably want to try and avoid , really . What are those ? They 're a kind of fruit we collected from a planet we visited recently . May I try one ? I 'll warn you , most people find these rather bitter . Most people spit them right back out . This is the first food I 've been able to feed myself since I was nine . T.J. , this is Young . Have you seen Rush ? He turned his damn radio off . I think I 've gotten you in trouble . They 're on their way now , sir . I took my vacation time . All of it ? Yeah . We have a lot of lost time to make up for . You got rid of the ugly chair . You can do better than that . Five or six percent would do it . That 's the thought . The problem is how to do that without any access to the ship 's core systems . Or for that matter , any knowledge of how they work in the first place . I 'm just saying . Show her everything you 've got . Nicholas ? It 's me again . We came out of FTL . Something 's happened to the ship . Okay , listen up , I promise to get to everyone , but right now , I need anyone who has a potential head injury or internal trauma to move to the front of the line . Don 't be shy . T.J. ! Put us to work . Anyone who 's shaky , don 't take any chances . The quiet ones could be in the worst shape . What about you ? I 'm fine . Go . Are we under attack or not ? No . It was a malfunction . He 's right , there 's no sign of any hostile ships in range . Not that I can tell , anyway . What happened , then ? I think there was an explosion . In the FTL drive . We 're adrift . Why ? An overload ? It could be anything . Can we access the engineering spaces ? Not without a space suit . Most of the ship 's unpressurized . Best to check the damage from outside the ship . I can fly a kino pretty well . Get to it . You two monitor from here . I 'll use the stones to report this . Mandy , are you sure you 're all right ? For a second there , I was back on earth in a strange house , back in my own body again . The link is temporarily severed when we go in and out of FTL . I 'm sorry , we weren 't expecting that to happen . I 'm fine . What do you remember ? I was walking , then I was somewhere else , and I don 't know how I got there . Then the explosion happened . So the lapse happened before ? Well , sometimes concussions can cause short-term memory loss . And confusion . We 'll just keep you here tonight , make sure it 's nothing more serious . T.J. ! He was on the floor . I couldn 't tell if he was hurt or not . Okay , put him over here , guys . Franklin ? This is Volker . Are you getting pictures ? Yeah , we see it . So is there anything I need to worry about ? I 've been with Amanda a long time . We 'll need to monitor her blood pressure , and there 's a few other things I need to show you . That just come with the territory , and she 'll be fine . I 'm sorry , it 's just I 'm new to all this . You 'll be fine too . What 's happening ? Incoming wormhole . This is Rush . We have an incoming wormhole . Sgt. Greer , please meet me in the gate room with a defense team . I need everybody out of here ! That won 't be necessary , Sergeant . Whoa , whoa , don 't shoot ! Stand down ! Told you . Oh , my brother . Greer ! I didn 't expect to see you again either . What do you mean you weren 't expecting to see us ? Didn 't you guys figure out a way for us to dial in ? I joined a book club . Yeah , it 's supposed to be all women , but there are a few enlightened young men who stop by , and claim to have an interest in 19th century chick-lit . Can we concentrate on eating right now ? Sorry . Sorry . You know what , why don 't I do that ? Yeah , we 'll be fine . One at a time . Got it . This isn 't , freaking you out , is it ? You 're here . That 's all that matters . Here . Well , we were pretty much resigned to the fact that we were stuck out there . Talk about feeling like a third wheel . And then on the second night , the kino remote just lit up . I guess I just thought you guys must 've figured something out . We dialed back , and here we are . I didn 't think it was possible to miss this bucket . Do you people realize you just scared the crap out of us ? Sorry , sir . You 're forgiven . So , are they going to live ? Looks like it . That planet couldn 't have been all that bad . That 's good . Because if we don 't get the FTL drive fixed , that 's where we 'll all be going . Really ? Really , Eli . I 'm sorry , but I 'm going to have to put you right back to work . Welcome back . How 's he doing ? Same , but something changed since we got stuck . Doesn 't he look different to you ? Maybe . It 's like he 's in there , and he knows exactly what 's going on , but his brain and his body just aren 't connected anymore . I don 't know . I talked to Rush , and he says I 'm probably just imagining it . Maybe I am . I mean , I haven 't slept in I don 't even know ... Why ? I keep having the same bad dream . I am stuck in a dark room , but I 'm not me , and I can 't get out . Are you claustrophobic ? Little bit . Maybe it 's some weird phantom memory . From your switch with Dr. Perry . Hey , math boy , got those calculations I was asking about ? Done . And plea don 't call me that . I know what that 's like . Nick called me " Little Miss Brilliant " a couple of times , and it stuck . Nick ? Nicholas . Rush ? We were colleagues back at SGC a couple of years before Icarus . He used to like to bounce ideas off of me when he was working on that ancient proof that you ended up solving . Congratulations , by the way . Look where it got me . I would do anything to be here . Anyway , after Nick 's wife passed away , we used to have these long talks about his work and my work , the Ancients , ascension . It was like he didn 't even see the chair . I tried calling him " Mr. Brilliant " a few times , but I don 't think he ever got the hint . You had a thing ? For him ? What 's wrong with that ? I just find it kind of surprising . Why , because a disabled person can 't have feelings for someone ? I meant because you were ... you were talking about him . Yeah ... Thanks for this . Sure ... Rush ? You 've got something ? Dr. Perry 's concluded that the explosion . May be to our advantage . How ? There was an overload . One that probably shouldn 't have happened . Because the system is unbelievably robust . With more safeguards than I can count , but it happened , and as with most overloads , it happened in the weakest link . The FTL drive is made up of 16 separate modules . The one that blew up was the weakest link . Because it was the least efficient . So the ship can fly on the other drives ? Even better than that . Without the worn-out drive . Bringing down overall efficiency , Destiny should be able to make it across the void . That 's great work . I wouldn 't pat anyone on the back just yet . We still need to isolate and bypass the damage . And with no access to the core systems , it has to be done manually . Or ... Or what ? The robot we found . We think it might be able to do some , or maybe all of the repairs . I 've already programmed rudimentary instructions to begin the repairs . Scott , this is Young . Eli and Dr. Perry have a shuttle mission . To brief you on . Copy that , sir , I 'm on my way . What are the odds ? That this is going to work ? Fair to middling . Time 's an issue . There is another option . Right , the chair . Well , if we can gain access to the core systems , we can bypass that damaged section . In a single command . Tell you what , if it comes right down to it , I 'll sit in the thing myself . Getting into position now . Opening rear hatch . Okay , we 're good . Here we go . Come in . Oh , hi . Hi . I 'd like permission to join the team . Going through the Stargate to the planet . Scott 's going . He 's a little busy flying the shuttle right now . He 's already on his way back . So is this how it 's going to be ? Maybe I 'd like to see the planet . Where I might have to raise our child . You mean , if the ship isn 't fixed by then ? Yeah , maternal instincts , I guess . Okay . Permission granted . Thanks . T.J ... I 'll be careful . Lt. Scott found fresh water due east of the Stargate . That 'll be your first stop . We should check out . As much land as possible . In case we end up having to live there . Send it . You know , we just came from there . This is a waste of time . It 's standard procedure , Eli . If you ask me , sometimes you military people are a little too ... Holy crap ! Did you see that ? I saw . Shut it down . Looks like they found your camp . Can they get through the Stargate ? Not without a remote . Lucky we weren 't still there , or else they 'd have one . Either way , we 're cut off . We have to fix the ship . You know , I could just go to the corner store . We need a decent grocery shopping . We 're almost out of everything . Okay . I shouldn 't be long . I 'll be right back . I could 've gone . I want her to get out of the house . Even if it 's just for an hour . Well , that 's it . You 've done it . That isolates the drive . Well , that was the easy part . We 'll start on the bypass in the morning , eh ? You guys don 't do much for fun . Around here , do you ? Well , there is Mr. Brody 's still . You have a still ? Come and see . So I 'm in a room , but I 'm not me . What do you see ? Nothing . Blackness , but I know that I am not alone . What if it isn 't a dream ? Thank you , Mr. Brody . Cheers . Now , be careful . This stuff has only one redeeming quality . We make do with what we have , right ? Yeah . Speaking of , how are you managing . Without your coffee ? Well , I must admit , that 's been one of the most difficult things . About being stuck up here . Oh , well , the hardships . I think " insanity " is the proper word . There and back again . I 've even had dreams about the stuff . Well , for years after my accident , I had dreams that I could walk . Yeah , no , I remember you telling me that . And then I get to do this , and it 's ... It 's all happening . God , it 's like a dream come true . Yeah . But we have to fix your ship . We do . And then I 'll have to wake up . Sir ? Yeah ? I think ... I think I was the one who damaged the ship . I 'm starting to notice that redeeming quality you were talking about . You 'll have to ask yourself if it was worth it in the morning . Can I ask you something ? Sure . After your wife passed away , and we 'd have those long talks , did you have any clue how I felt about you ? I thought you felt sorry for me . I guess I thought the same about you at first . I thought you were absolutely brilliant . Remember I used to call you . Little Miss Brilliant ... Yeah , just forget about that . I could never be sorry about that . Good night . Nick ... Yeah ? Would you like to come in ? Yeah . Look , I 'm sorry , darling , I 'm sorry . I can 't do this . Why ? I just , I can 't do this . Nick ... It 's me . I think we both know . It 's a bit more complicated than that . The word is " insane . " Yeah . But this is also . A once in a lifetime chance for me . Mandy ... You know , probably better than anyone , how I was when Gloria passed away . I recently experienced . Something that made me go through it all again . More than a dream . As real as this is to you now , and I can tell myself that it 's been years . All I like . But in my heart . It 's just happened again . Well , at least this time ... I can do this . Oh , sorry , I ... What is it ? The Colonel needs to see you in the interface room right away . Both of you . Is everything all right ? No , it 's about to hit the fan again . Let 's go . You were gone for hours ! I know , I 'm sorry . I locked my keys in the car ... I thought you had gotten into an accident . I imagined you being taken away . By an ambulance ! No . No , no , no , no . Oh , God , Camile , I 'm sorry ! My imagination just went ... Hey , hey , hey ... I know what it 's like . To wait for someone you love to come home . I 'm here now . I know . Okay . Mary ? Mary ! Mary ! I don 't know what 's happening . I 'm just going to elevate her legs . Above her heart to stabilize . You 're doing fine , just try and stay calm . We were just talking , and then she ... I don 't know . What 's going on ? She 's going to be okay . Lieutenant James left the comm room . Without wiping her imprint off of the stone . It got knocked onto the table , and nobody noticed . We think that in that opportunity , an alien might have taken advantage , used the stones , and sabotaged our FTL drive . She told me she blacked out . Around the time of the explosion . I thought it was post-concussion syndrome . Well , mystery solved . I don 't see how it changes anything . What part don 't you get ? They know we 're out here . Yeah , they already did . Without a tracking device , there 's no way of them knowing where we 've dropped out of FTL . Yeah , he 's right . The void is unimaginably huge . They can 't know our location . Unless the alien who took over James 's body . Managed to broadcast it . Like a subspace message , you mean . Or the alien figured out our position before the explosion and took it back with them . How would it know how ... They sabotaged the ship . How did they know how to do that ? He 's right . That 's it , then . They 're coming . I 'm so sorry . Don 't be silly . I brought this on myself . Forgive the intrusion . Come on in . Colonel Young just used the stones to report . There 's a strong possibility that Dr. Perry may have to return to her body . In the next several hours . We think it 's best that she returns . To an air force facility . We 'll say our goodbyes . I 'll wait outside . Let 's go ! This is Young . While repairs to the ship are still days from being complete , despite our best efforts , we believe an attack will happen at any moment . Shields will not withstand a sustained bombardment . This time , we will not be able to jump to FTL . Neither can we escape through the Stargate . Lt. Scott will be in charge of our ship 's defenses . Follow his orders as you would mine . If boarded , Sgt. Greer will coordinate the strike teams , but everyone will have to join in our defense . We 'll give them a good fight . When the time comes , don 't wait too long . It 'll be okay . I want you there . To talk me through it . This is all my fault . I panicked . The chair ... They 're here , sir . Tell me what to do . We 've managed to isolate . The damaged module from the rest . You have to command the ship to enter FTL on the remaining drives ... How the hell do I do that ? Well , first you have to sit in the chair . Wait ! Dr. Franklin just spoke . Something about the chair . What about it ? That 's it , that 's all he said , but I think he knows what 's going on , and I think he was trying to say that it should be him . You can 't possibly know that . Well , no , sir , but I really think that ... We 're under attack . I 'm gonna do this . No , wait a minute , she might be right . I can 't ask a man to sacrifice his life , Rush . Franklin 's already been through the process . His brain will have had time to heal ... We don 't have time for this ! Which is exactly why it should be him and not you . At least give him the choice . Dr. Franklin ... Dr. Franklin ? This ship is under attack . If someone doesn 't go back and sit in the chair . And help the repairs , then the ship 's going to be taken . We 're all going to be taken . Do you understand . What we are asking you to do ? Concentrate your fire on the smallest ships . They 're going to try and board us . Go back to your team . Yes , sir . The temperature 's dropping fast . Any idea why ? I don 't know . This is something new . Go . Something 's happening . Sergeant , keep an eye on that door . Yes , sir . Dammit ! Greer ? We 're about to be boarded right on top of your position . Copy that . Colonel ? I thought you were ... The FTL drive is powering up . Does this mean you fixed the ship ? Camile ? No , it 's me again . Don 't you hate that ? What 's our status ? The damaged section of the ship . Has been bypassed . The FTL drive has increased efficiency . It 's a bit early to say , but it looks like we 're going to make it across . We did it . Yes , we did , and now it 's time to go . It 's not a very nice thing to say , but I do hope you need my help again . Well , I 'm not above arranging that , you know . Bye , Mandy . Bye , Nick . Nicholas ? Welcome back , Camile . Anything happen ? You 'd know better than I would , sir . I was watching a closed door . Did it stay closed ? Yes , sir .

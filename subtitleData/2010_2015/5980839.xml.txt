 Previously on Continuum ... Which one of you is my partner ? My friend ? There are two Alec Sadlers in this time line . Go . And don 't get caught . I won 't forget this . Escher was Alec 's father . That I did not see coming . Welcome to your new home . If the enemy won 't meet us in the battlefield , then we must bring the battlefield to them . Moving into your position . Bravo unit head to 12-9 for Evac . Over . We lost Bravo 3 , I repeat we 've lost Bravo 3 . Heavy rounds coming from the rooftop , Request air-strike . Got him ! They are bringing reinforcements . Cameron ? Where are you ? Moving toward Evac zone . Don 't . Please , don 't . Wounded hostile . Quadrant 12-9 . No , I 'm not the enemy . That 's our informant sir . Terminate and move out . He is our informant , sir . He has Liber8 intel that we need . That intel has been acquired by other means . System override . Bravo unit copy , override . No no no no no ! Suit system restored . Move on , soldier . Yes , sir . Birthday gift , from my daughter . Siamese fighting fish . Maybe she 's trying to tell you something . She 's a very straightforward girl . She doesn 't do metaphor . Maybe I should re-gift it to you . I 'm also a straightforward girl . You promised me help with my murder . What do you want ? In the other time line , Curtis was against our arrangement . Maybe that sentiment carries over into this one . Curtis knows your value now . But he didn 't know it before my death . Tell me . These changes in the police department , the specialized divisions . Does it feel like a familiar path ? Feels like the future I come from , started here . From our point of view that 's nothing but good news . Good to have your experience on our side . A back-up system to ensure we 're on the right path . That 's what we want . Stability . And that is a luxury I cannot enjoy with my killer walking around . I am working on your behalf Kiera , believe me . I value you on my team . We can help each other . I know it . Hello . Come to Lucas . Shh ! What 's going on , man ? I don 't know . Hey ! Hey ! Hey , stop right there , Lucas ! Don 't do it ! Open up ! Easy way or hard way , Lucas ? Nice work . Thanks . I missed the sushi ? We can hit some on the way . So the Department of Corrections finally sent us those pictures we asked for . Lucas has been cannibalizing parts from all over the prison . But this is a newly-minted microcircuit . Prison hasn 't had an upgrade in 20 years . Somebody smuggled it in to him . I got Betty doing a background check on anyone who 's had contact with Lucas . Check this out . Lucas is messed up . Yeah everything 's messed up around here apparently . I am the person you know . I am . Yeah I 'll be sure to remember that . Down ! Everybody down ! Don 't do that ! Everyone get down ! Get over there Move ! I want the manager . Everybody down ! I 'm the Manager . Don 't hurt anyone please ! I want in the vault ! Get down ! I said get down Ah ! I said let me into the vault ! Okay it 's this way . Please don 't hurt anybody . Everyone , move over there ! Let 's go ! Down ! Quiet ! Move over here where I can see you ! Line up ! Don 't move . He 's gonna kill us . Shut up ! We 're all gonna die ! We 're all gonna die . We 're gonna die . It 's gonna be okay . It 's gonna be okay . Anyone else ? Anyone else ? ! Hello . I 'm Jacqueline . I was Mr. Escher 's chief counsel . Please , do have a seat . We have a lot to talk about . Mr. Escher , your father , wanted things done in a particular way so ... My father ? There 's a personal letter in your carrier . I believe it explains many of his choices . What ? This isn 't true ... Mom ? The will is very clear . The document you hold in your hands will explain things more completely . Alec , your inheritance . Mom ? Escher is Mark . The Mark that left us 15 years ago , but he is your father . Alec 's inheritance is what ? A controlling interest in the company . And will anyone contest that ? Mom . I 'm just looking out for you , that 's all I 'm doing . There will be hoops to jump through , of course . Particularly with the Board of Directors who will undoubtedly seek to put you in an advise-only position . And the plan is that you will navigate him through this ? That is what his father wanted . Let 's go ! What did you say ? What ? What ? Nothing ! You 're safe ! Go ! I can do it . Right . Now . No . Please . Please . Please . No ! DéjÃ vu all over again . You were at transnational two days ago ? Exact same playbook . Respectable looking thieves . Suicide vests . Vault entry . And then mayhem . Transnational thieves were felons , right ? White-collar variety . Fines , not time . Ha . Ain 't that always the way . Wow . Looks like this was one crime they couldn 't wiggle out of . But if you stop the crime before you get away with anything ... Somebody got away with something . Half of the transnational safe-deposit box holders made insurance claims . It 's hard to prove what was stolen when the contents are unknown . It 's hard to prove anything was stolen if the thieves blew up . Yeah , I don 't get it . They had this . They 're 10 feet from the door , loaded for bear , and then suddenly lose their shit . Ballistics matched the gun that was recovered with the transnational robbery to a shipment of guns stolen by Liber8 . Liber8 always plays the long game . We 'll ID the robbers , see what the connection is from that end . In the meantime , you figure out what game Liber8 's playing . These robberies started after Lucas escaped . What does he bring to the party that nobody else does ? The crazy . I 'm in control of my emotions this way . I can see what you 're in control of . Look what I found . Can someone tell me why a legitimate business needs to hide some of its prettiest things ? And some of its dirtiest . Patents . MOUs . Environmental assessments . No corporation is going to file an insurance claim for losses like these . Dirty little secrets . And we 're in control of them now . Those men weren 't collateral damage . And they weren 't innocent . You know it 's not that . We done here ? Not yet . What 's the next bank ? I need a list of all the clients whose boxes were rifled . Clients pay for their anonymity . And empty doesn 't mean stolen . Alright . Fair enough . But only some of these boxes were opened . How would the thieves know which ones to target ? I don 't know . Lucky guess ? Well they didn 't care if they were seen in the lobby . But in here , they wanted to hide what they were doing . We 're gonna need that list . Sonmanto holds a number of safe deposit boxes and uses them primarily as back-up for pending patents , contracts , etc . Well it will be very helpful to our investigation to know exactly what 's been removed . I checked the records as soon as we knew about the robbery . That particular box was empty . As I mentioned , we have more than a few . You do know that impeding a police investigation is a very serious offense . And you know that as a Fortune500 company , we have a full complement of lawyers that can back-up my truthful and helpful statement . But why go there . Liber8 is behind this robbery Mr. Richardson . You don 't want them having anything of yours . And they don 't . You went at him pretty hard . Yeah well I don 't need a future chip to know that he 's lying his ass off . We 've got half the companies filing for losses they can 't prove and the other half denying anything was stolen at all . Yeah . Well that just means whatever they have , they weren 't supposed to have . You don 't sound surprised . Yeah well I had that knocked out of me . Carlos . I want to help you get through this . What can I do ? Well you remember your dead body in the trunk ? How about you erase that . Yeah so it 's unusual . Thermite charges with an accelerant ? The explosive load designed to implode towards the body . That 's why there were no casualties . Except for these three , of course . Pop rocks ? You ever heard of anything like this ? Ugh . No I haven 't . FIU retrieved wiring and components that suggest a radio transmitter . Let me see that . Radio transmitter . But the bank cameras caught them pressing the trigger ? If you say so , yeah . It 's just a weird set-up . You know , imploding . How close would someone have to be to trigger the detonation ? I 'm a blood and guts guy . That 's a little bit out of my depth . I 'm not sure . I 've got a guy that swims in these waters . May I ? Um yeah , okay . Sure . Need it back . Is there anything else that 's not in the playbook ? Well , with an explosion there 's a little bit of everything , but I did notice these components had more cerebral spinal fluid than I expected . So this is soaked in brain juice ? Apparently . Is it the kind of thing that could be remotely triggered ? I don 't know . I can 't just look at a thing and automatically know what it means . But from what you say , it could be like an on-board computer . A chip that receives signals . A primitive CMR . In a way . Some labs are working on brain-to-brain interface . They use it on insects , monkeys , rats . It 's like an actual mind meld . No ? Uh , it 's like the internet , but for brains . Well Sonya 's got the surgical chops . Lucas can program pretty much anything . Did they have human drones in the future ? Not exactly . Cyborgs . Robots . Cool . Not cool . Liber8 infiltrated the systems and hacked the robots to use as weapons . They became a liability . In the end , all non-human workers were destroyed . Less cool . Did you know Escher was my father ? No . I figured . I just wondered if ... I never had a father . Not that I could remember . And when I met him , I didn 't like him much . I think he was reaching out to you . In his own way . Oh yeah , he reached out . I inherited Piron . I know , I 'm Alec SadTech Sadler , and Piron exists as a separate entity in your future . Yeah . Well maybe I 'll sell it . Maybe I 'll sell it right now . Alec . You don 't have to do anything today . This news has to be devastating . Even if you don 't feel it yet . I don 't know what I 'm feeling . Escher was trying to run my life . Invading it . I mean a normal person might think of a different way . Hey Alec , want to go out for coffee ? Oh by the way I am your father . Maybe he didn 't know how to tell you . Yeah . You say mission , I say lie . Well maybe we can use this tech to patch your CMR problem . Hmm . Little incision here . Couple of wires there . And my phantom limb is back . Perfect . Think you can hurry up ? Look who 's talking . Your golf bags ? Really ? We 'll have time before breakfast tomorrow . You can shag a few balls can 't ya ? Yeah ... Ah ! Carlos , I went over it again last night and the only thing that makes sense is that Liber8 is fishing for something specific in those safety deposit boxes . You have any idea what that could be ? A lot of these corporations are using high-security encrypted drives with long-life back-up battery systems . Now these units emit very low electromagnetic radiation which can be picked up using the right gear . Well that 's great . But it means nothing unless we know which bank they 're going to hit next . True enough , but if it was me , I 'd want to clear all my stuff before that happens . I 've been monitoring all the lower mainland branches and the Bregenzer Bank has a lot of high-end visitors today . The kind of visitors that usually have lackeys do their work ? VP . VP . VP . Alec 's right . They 're clearing out their boxes in case there 's another robbery . If we can confront them about what they 're hiding , maybe we can figure out the Liber8 connection . Alright let 's go chat them up . I 'll meet you there . Alec . Don 't make any rash decisions , okay ? Sure . You 're investigating Escher 's murder , right ? Not me personally . Alright . Well if you hear anything , can you let me know , now that ... Of course . Thanks . Emily . It is really good to see you . Yeah ! That was weird . Kiera was sentimental . Don 't . What ? Look I know what you did . He sent you to spy on me ? Alec if you can hear me for just a minute . Escher is not just some businessman . He 's my father . If you knew that , you 're worse than I thought . I ... I didn 't know . Alec . Don 't . I 'm sorry . Carlos . So did you find a mattress that you think is safer ? Strange that you 're coming after the victims of crime instead of the criminals . Mr. Richardson . My apologies for the delay but we 're ready for you now . You can keep your secrets . Just point us in the right direction . What do you think Liber8 's after ? Think of all the things you 'd rather keep to yourself , Ms. Cameron . They 're special and significant to you for any number of reasons . Now multiply that by millions and you 're approaching the patents , agreements and research that my company would rather keep to itself . If Liber8 is after one particular thing , I honestly couldn 't tell you what that might be . That guy is ... Is good at his job . Not quite what I was going to say but fair enough . I knew what you were going to say . Emily . Alec . I can explain everything but first I want to say I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry . I know everything , Emily . And it 's okay . But I have something to tell you and it 's very important . And you know I love you and my whole situation with Kiera 's just complicated . Okay , I 'm doing this all wrong . Hey , do you remember our first date ? We talked about the Novikov self-consistency principle ? Time travel paradoxes . Well he got it wrong . You know the device ... the ball that was in the lab ? And Escher had a power source ? Something horrible happened . I had to change things . Emily , I traveled through time for you . Okay look I know how that sounds . But if you just listen to me . So this is how you 're punishing me ? No , Emily . I know I did wrong but all I want to do is make up for it . And this is your idea of fun ? Jerking me around ? Emily listen okay . I know you want to go to Thailand . I know you want to escape your problems things you did in the past things that I don 't care about because I love you . I might be a lying bitch but you 're an asshole . You ... He loves you too . But I 'm the one that knows everything . I 'm the one that risked everything to come back for you . Now he doesn 't know but I 'm leaving that decision up to you , okay . You 're in control . Who was that ? Some lost guy . Look I feel completely betrayed by you okay . You 're spying on me , reporting to Escher , telling me that you love me ? But I know that my Father was a controlling jerk so I can believe that he used you . Okay . But I don 't know if I can trust you anymore . None of this feels right . Once I have a clearer head then maybe we should talk . Okay . You are hiding something . This is a robbery ! Come on move ! I said move ! Down ! Move this way ! Move it ! Jesus . That 's Frank Ryan . He used to run our financial products division . The vault . Open or we blow it up ! Move ! Everyone on your knees ! On your knees ! Stay down . Everyone on the floor ! Get down ! Shut up ! This is a welcome surprise . Yeah , sorry to just drop in like this . I had to sort some things out in my head . Thought this might be a good place to clear away the other distractions . Have a seat . Really ? How 's it feel ? It 's a lot to take in . It doesn 't seem right . It 's not me . I suppose there 's some precedence in refusing an inheritance Mr. Sadler . But I 'm not the person to assist you with that . However , if you 'll permit me to show you something I believe your father would have wanted you to see , it may , as you say , help clear away the distractions . If you 'll follow me . This is ... you 're working on ... ? Genetics . And this lab will move to our defense technologies division , obviously . Your father always imagined you here , in the calm center of it all . You 're working with silicone transistors ? Mhm . That 's kind of old news . In the health field , yes . But we 're hoping to create something for the commercial market . Something that could combine with optogenetics . Self activating neurotransmitters ? I 've read about early research . There 's so many uses . Life-changing implications . Or life-enhancing . Without the use of implants . You wear it ? We hope . We have an advantage if they don 't know we 're cops . Agreed . What do you see ? Clayton said the vests were designed to implode . These have a lot of wires coming out of them . I don 't know if they 're the same . They 're being controlled . Wires run from the vests into the cerebral cortex . So if we pull the wires it stops them ? Or it kills them . I have to get into that vault . How do you plan on doing that ? Guess . Oh . Of course . Create a diversion ? Did you see that ? What ? One of the hostages , to the left . You mean the guard ? No . Why is that chair moving ? Keep an eye on that group . What happened to the video ? It 's some kind of , uh , interference . There 's a frequency coming through that 's just unusual . Unusual how ? Well it 's a frequency that won 't be used for decades . Can you isolate it ? Um . I 'll try something . Open that one . What is that ? Play that back . It 's not responding . Come on ! Play it back ! Get it to respond . He 's offline . I want whatever was in that box . I 'm not going to hurt you . Hey ! Hey What happens if I unplug these wires ? What wires ? Great . There . The Protector . Control the situation . I got this . Please . Stay here . Are you kidding ? I can 't move ! The cop . He 's right there . Get him . Ah ! Forget the cop . Get the protector . Where 's 2 ? Still rebooting . Ahh Blow number 3 . No , please no Number 2 is back online . Alright I 'll take care of it . Back off . I got this . Focus on the cop . I 'll take care of the Protector . Liber8 's gonna kill them all . We can save them . They don 't have to die . Yeah ? How do we do that ? Got her . Ah shit We 've lost number 2 . Blow number 1 . I 'm standing . I have to unhook these wires . Don 't ! Please , I 'm walking . I haven 't done that in years . Where 's number 1 ? It 's offline . Please don 't do it . They 'll kill you if I don 't . I 'm sorry . No , we 're not finished yet . Check on number 4 . What happened to him ? The future . You okay ? Yeah . You ? Yeah . Except there 's nothing to stop Liber8 from doing this again . There 's something going on with those two ? Was she in the vault with you ? I left her in there with Frank . She 's hacked . Yeah and Noll was at all the robberies . Helping out . Yeah , some help . Up against the wall ! Hey Get off me ! We got another one . I didn 't do anything I doubt that . What are you doing ? Get her a medic . Kiera ! Let 's go ! Noll ! Hold on , Carlos . Back up to the bar . Back up . I 'm disappointed in you . You help a girl out . You don 't own her . Turn around . Any wires hooked in you ? Asshole . Making all your own decisions . Pick up that shit . Now we 're even . Oh ! Are you a cop ? Or are you a terrorist , huh ? Which one are you ? Which one are you ! Carlos ! Stop ! Carlos ! Get off him ! Get off ! This isn 't you , Carlos . This is probably what Liber8 was after . Do you know what it is ? No . But we 'll figure it out . I don 't recognize it from 2077 . It did a real number on my gear , and my CMR is still glitching . This technology could be from a different time line . Different future . We 'll keep it safe . Who had it ? There hasn 't been an insurance claim for ' mysterious object from unspecified future ' , so no idea . I knew I was right about you . Vickerdale . Gautuma . Sonmanto . Three horsemen of the apocalypse right there . We take them out now ; we destroy the corporate congress of the future . And take a look at this from their secure drive . Oh Sonmanto . You 're a naughty company . Whatever the play , it has to do double-duty . You lost ground with the human bombs . When did you get so squeamish ? When you turned men into things . Some men deserve it . Thank you . I thought you 'd still be in the hospital . I 'm supposed to go back . See a specialist . I still got wires in there and they don 't want to mess around . Me neither . How would you like to change the world ? How 'd you get that ? We 're Sonmanto . We have friends everywhere . And between this little box and the wires left in you , Mr. Ryan , you can throw those away for good . Miracle cure , is that it ? You tell me . You were the one walking around six hours ago . Hey . Hi , it 's me . How you doing ? You should see the lab here . Anything I can think of I can find . You sound like someone who 's changing his mind about an inheritance . Piron 's got fingers in hundreds of pies which should sound menacing or at least greedy but I don 't know , some of these projects ? There 's so much potential . So your father wasn 't that bad after all . Maybe not . Maybe you 'll find a way to reconnect my CMR . I knew you missed us . Of course I did . Let 's get things back to normal . Whatever normal is . Sorry Kiera , I have to go . It 's better if he doesn 't know .

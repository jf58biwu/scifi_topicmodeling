 RUSH : This is what Destiny intended from the moment it entered the star system . YOUNG : That ship is the best chance we have of getting home . - Are we done ? - We 'll never be done . WRAY : You shouldn 't have left him on the planet . YOUNG : You think I don 't know that ? CHLOE : Everyone thinks we 're safe . They think that they 'll never find us again . Why did you take one of our people prisoner ? ( SNARLS ) CHLOE : We 're not safe , are we ? - TELFORD : They 're coming ! - Who 's coming ? Lucian Alliance , they 're coming to take Destiny . RUSH : There 's only one way this is going to end if we wait . YOUNG : I 'm not surrendering this ship . VARRO : I want to know how long you plan on keeping us locked up . What do we have to do to earn our freedom ? Prove to me that you 're not a threat . ELI : My mom was a nurse . She got stuck by a needle trying to restrain a junkie in the ER . She got HIV . SHARON : Do whatever you need to do to get yourself back home , 'cause I 'm going to be here . - ( GUN FIRING ) - ( CHLOE GROANING ) - CHLOE : What happened ? - You were shot . There is no leg wound . It 's almost completely healed . JOHANSEN : How is that possible ? CHLOE : I don 't know . Hey . What are you doing in here ? Are you okay ? I don 't know how I got here . The last thing I remember , I was lying down for a nap . Sleepwalking ? I used to do it all the time as a kid . My dad had to put an alarm on the front door to make ... - I 'll see you later . - O kay . ELI : Seriously . And it 's not just this one thing . She 's been acting a little odd for a while now . You know what I 'm talking about , right ? It 's not just me noticing ... No , no . You 're right . She 's been acting ... different . She 's quiet and withdrawn . We should talk to her about it . I did . I mean , I tried , yesterday . And ? And nothing . She wasn 't in the mood . She was too busy writing in her diary . She keeps a diary ? It 's kind of a therapy for her . It 's all the stress of being on the ship ... And what about that gunshot wound on her leg ? No one heals that fast . How do you explain that ? Eli , I can 't . You need to use the stones . Your mother 's sick . What ... ( CLEARS THROAT ) Is she ... I don 't know the details . Just that they want you to go back as soon ... GLORIA : You need to sleep , Nic . - Nicholas ... - Yes , yes . Soon . ( COUNTDOWN CLOCK ACTIVATES ) Manipulating the countdown clock is complicated , to say the least . So many variables tied into it . Well , that 's the problem , isn 't it ? A myriad of systems , each as complicated as the next . Made worse by one man trying to do the work of an entire crew . Well , for now , I just need to control the countdown clock , and if you are indeed the ship , why aren 't you helping me ? What are you really hoping to gain ? Control of the ship is key to the mission . ( ON RADIO ) Dr. Rush , this is Brody . Come in . Go ahead . We just dropped out of FTL . Yes , I 'm aware of that , thank you . But again , no gates in range . PARK : And now we 're banking left , changing course again . It doesn 't make sense . Dr. Rush ? Dr. Rush ? Look , I 'm sorry . I can 't get away right now . - Where are you ? - What are you doing ? Rush , out . This is getting ridiculous . Getting old , is what it is . BRIGHTMAN : She stopped taking her treatment . Unfortunately , her counts dropped , dipping below 300 . Opening the door for pneumonia . We 've re-started the AVR therapy , and we 're successfully treating the pneumonia . Her counts have leveled off , so physically , she 's on the mend . But if she stops taking her treatment again ... Don 't let her . - Okay , when she returns home ... - Don 't release her . Keep her here . We will monitor her condition closely , but what concerns me is she is still clearly suffering from depression . One of our psychiatrists has been treating her , but hasn 't made much progress , which is why we sent for you . Look , whether here or at home , she has to want to get better . There 's no room for error now . If her counts drop below 200 ... Yeah , yeah , I know . AIDS . I 'll be down the hall if you need me . ( KNOCK AT DOOR ) Hi . I 'm Airman Tracy . I 've been working with your son , Eli . Is he all right ? Yeah , he 's fine . He really wanted to be here , but the military , they 've got him pretty tied up . He 's doing great things , though , working really hard . Anyway , he heard about you being in the hospital . Tell him I 'm fine . No , but see , he ... He knows you 're not fine . He told me about your condition . He heard you stopped taking your meds , and he 's really ... Really worried about you . Not enough to be here himself . ( SPEAKS MANDARIN ) Yeah , it 's me . I was just checking . ( BOTH LAUGHING EX CITEDLY ) Where are we ? What ? You and me . Our relationship . I mean , if we had met in a different situation , away from this ship , would we still be together ? Of course . It 's just ... ( SIGHING ) This is all kind of new to me , you know ? I 've never been all that great at relationships and ... I just want to make sure that I don 't mess this up . You 've been kind of quiet lately , so I start wondering and thinking , " God , she 's ... " Matt . Ta-da ! Your favorite . Mmm ! I am really missing your cooking . Microwave 's getting a lot of work , huh ? Yeah , and take-out . Mostly take-out . You know me . I work most nights , so , a lot of pizza . Everything okay ? Of course . You 're here . Everything is perfect . ( SHARON SIGHING ) Mmm ! It 's really good . Go . GREER : You 're releasing them ? We can 't keep them locked up forever , Sergeant . Sir , I beg to differ . We 're not doing it without strings attached . They 've been giving us intel . The more they give , the more they get . The decision 's made , Sergeant . I 've put an escort on each Lucian Alliance member , so it 's not like they 're walking around free . Excuse me , Colonel ? Have you seen Chloe ? No . I 've been searching everywhere for her . She 's gone . Mornin ' . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Yeah , so the clock says . Well , apparently it 's Sunday , too . The colonel decided to release them into the general population . We 'll see how that turns out . Whoa ! Doesn 't look like it 's off to a good start . - Hey ! What 's going on here ? - Just making conversation . No , no . You apologize to her . - Why ? - Apologize ! - All right , take it easy . - Think you can tell me what to do ? - As a matter of fact , I do . - I 'm not trying to ... What the hell are you ... You don 't mess with my people . - Just talking to the woman . - No , see , you don 't talk to anyone . Oh , is she yours ? I didn 't know . Put him back in the hold till he learns some manners . I 'm sorry , I 'm not trying to ... No , no . See , the more you talk , the longer you 'll be locked up . You okay ? Chloe 's missing . Colonel wants us to form search teams and look for her . ( WHOOSHING ) GLORIA : You work yourself to exhaustion . Much work to be done . Lack of sleep leads to carelessness . I needn 't remind you that two lives have already been lost . Colonel ... I know . I 'm sorry . - My behavior , unacceptable . - Yeah , it was . I know it 's important to fit in . To get along with your people , and I can do this , I promise . We made a deal . We give you information , you give us freedom . And I intend to hold up my end of that deal . You can trust me . Chloe . Chloe . What are you doing in here ? ( ON RADIO ) Lieutenant Scott , we found her . Copy that . - WRAY : What are you looking for ? - My keys . - You can 't find your keys . - No . I thought they were in my purse , but ... ( LAUGHS ) Ladies and gentlemen , this is a first . You know , you 've never misplaced anything as long as I can ... ( FRUSTRATINGLY ) Are you going to help me find them or not ? I 'm sorry . It 's just , I 'm late , and I can 't ... I was bringing the groceries in yesterday . Idiot . - It 's okay . - No , it 's not . Because anyone could 've walked in here and taken all of our things ... Sharon . I 'll be an hour at most , maybe two . I 'll call you if anything changes . ( DOOR CLOSES ) ( KNOCK AT DOOR ) Morning . You up for company ? Sure . You 're looking better . Doctor said you 'll be out of here in no time . Why doesn 't he call me ? It 's been months now . Nothing . It 's not like him . Okay , okay . What 's your favorite movie of all time ? What ? Just go with me on this . Your favorite movie . Grease . No , there 's another one . - Sound of Music ? - No , what ... Your favorite science fiction movie ? - ( SIGHS ) I 'm not a fan of ... - E. T. Right ? - That 's your favorite . - Yes . I love that movie . You rented it and showed it to him when he was a kid . You wondered if aliens really existed . If it 's possible to fly spaceships to other planets in other solar systems . - What has this got to do with ... - It is possible . Not just to other solar systems , other galaxies . You see , the government , they have this program , the Stargate program . And what a Stargate is , is it 's like a doorway . It allows you to step through and travel great distances through space , halfway across the universe in some cases ... - Why are you telling me this ? - Because I am Eli . I 'm on a ship , far , far away , but my consciousness is in this person 's body . It really is me , Mom . I am your son . JOHANSEN : You have no memory of going into the storage room ? No , I fell asleep in my quarters . Next thing I know , I 'm talking to Lieutenant James . This isn 't the first time this has happened , is it ? It 's like I black out from time to time . Those aliens used the communication stones - to take control of Lieutenant James . - Because we forgot to reset them . I was just in the communications lab . The stones are clean . Listen , there doesn 't seem to be anything physically wrong with you that I can tell . I 'd need an EEG or a CAT scan to be more thorough . I would like to keep her overnight , though , for observation . That 's a good idea . And once the stone is in place and the device is turned on , you actually swap consciousness with the person on the other end . You go into their body and then they go into yours , and ... And ... You don 't believe me . - I don 't understand . - I know . I know it 's weird . Where is Eli ? He 's on a ship , okay , the Destiny , on the other side of the universe . When is he coming home ? I don 't know , it 's a long , long way . Billions of light years from Earth . - How did he get there ? - The Stargate , Mom ! Okay . Okay , Mom ... Stop calling me that . You are not my son . The day Dad left , I was 14 . I ran up to my room , crying . You came up , told me that I needed to be strong for you . You said I needed to be the man that he wasn 't . Remember ? How could I know that if I wasn 't Eli ? He could 've told you . How could he possibly have told me every little thing about his ... - Leave me alone ! - ( SIGHS ) Please , Mom . It really is me . - Nurse , nurse ! - I know it 's a lot to take in . Mom ? - Nurse ! Please leave . - Please . JOHANSEN : What is it ? Ancient ? RUSH : Some of it . Those symbols , they looked familiar to me , and then I remembered where I saw them . In the crashed alien ship . Some of this I understand , but most of it 's too far advanced . They must 've done something to her , planted something in her brain . You said she didn 't have any tracking devices in her . No , she didn 't . Not that I was aware of . There may be something happening to Chloe on a cellular level . Some kind of genetic manipulation gradually changing her . - Into what ? - You think she 's changing into one of them ? I want her quarantined . We don 't know for sure if that 's what 's going on here . - We cannot just lock her up . - Until we know what 's wrong with her , I can 't risk letting her walk around free on this ship , can I ? I think the risk might be worth it . If we can monitor her behavior , the frequency of her blackouts , where she goes , what she does , we might gain more insight into what 's actually happening . Certainly quicker than isolating her in a room . She 's not to be left alone , ever . Yes , sir . WRAY : Hey . Thanks for coming . I didn 't have anyone else I could call . Well , how 's your mom doing ? Physically , fine . Her pneumonia 's healing . Her T-cell counts are stable now that they 've restarted her therapy , but she 's ... I was always worried she might give up if something happened to me , - and now , she 's ... - Nothing 's happened to you . She doesn 't even know it 's me . I tried to tell her . But as far as she 's concerned , the military took her son away , won 't even tell her where he is or won 't let him talk to her . I would give up too . Eli , no one is giving up . You know , whether she believes you or not , she has to take her meds . And you need to make her understand that . ( SNIFFLES ) I can 't go near the Control Interface Room or use the stones to visit my mom . It 's only temporary , just till we figure out what 's going on here . Lieutenant , time for a shift change . I 'll take over from here . - Oh , it 's okay . I don 't mind . - Colonel 's orders , I 'm afraid . I promise I won 't let her out of my sight . It 's all right . Okay . I 'll check in on you later . Come with me . What is this ? A place for study . ( DOOR CLOSING ) Problems to solve . Does any of this look familiar to you ? Take your time . Look closely . ( KNOCK AT DOOR ) - Settling in ? - Yes . Nice quarters . Come in . The Ancients probably figured they 'd be here a while , might as well give themselves some measure of comfort . How long will they be tagging along with us ? As long as you give them reason to . - One of your men , Simeon . - Yes , I know . I heard . And I 'm sorry . He 's not the most diplomatic person in our group . The culture on his homeworld was rougher than most . Colonel Young has decided to release him , but if he slips up again ... I 'll talk to him . We 're trying to make this work . He needs to try harder . ( DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES ) CHLOE : Hey ! Oh , there you are . Been looking all over for you . You didn 't answer your radio , so I thought ... RUSH : Sorry . Lost track of time . She 's all yours . You okay ? Yeah . Fine . What were you doing ? He wanted me to look at some equations , - see if I understood them . - Did you ? I don 't know . WRAY : ( SIGHS ) Hey , sorry I 'm late . It 's just that Eli , you know , when he gets to talking ... - How 's his mother ? - Oh ! ( SIGHING ) Doing okay , physically . It 's just emotionally . This is all starting to take its toll . You okay ? Your dinner 's in the oven . ( CHUCKLES ) You cooked ? Mmm . An attempt . - Looks good . - Famous last words . So , how was your day ? Mmm , long . Exhausting . The usual . I 'll get another . Give us a minute . Back inside . ( DOOR CLOSING ) - I won 't let you ruin this for us . - I was just talking to the woman . - You wanna get us all locked up for good ? - What difference does it make ? Sooner or later they 're gonna realize the information we 've been feeding them is just a bunch of lies anyway . The information you 've been feeding them . What are you talking about ? I thought we were all giving them the same misinformation ... We 're cooperating with them , all of us . We have to find a way to get along with these people . You want me to play the game , I 'll play it , but I 'm not taking ... I 'm not taking ... Don 't play any game at all . Don 't play any game at all ! Just keep your mouth shut . ( DOOR OPENS ) ( COUNTDOWN CLOCK ACTIVATES ) Damn it . Again with this ? - No gates . - Altered course . Bet you a day 's rations he doesn 't answer . ( SIGHS ) Dr. Rush , this is Brody . Come in . Dr. Rush , please respond . - You owe me . - I never agreed to that . BRODY : I don 't think it 's because of pulsar damage . There would be a pattern to the jump intervals , however frequent they are . There 's also the changes in the ship 's course once we drop out of FTL . It also seems too coincidental that every time this happens , we can 't seem to get a hold of Rush . He 's doing this ? How ? Outside of cracking the master code ? - I don 't know . - Figure it out . - Yeah . We could really use Eli for that . - Eli 's not here right now . - Well , you can get him back . - He needs to be where he is right now , so I need you to figure it out . YOUNG : Why is your radio off ? - Sorry , I was in my quarters sleeping . - Wrong . You didn 't answer my call , I sent Corporal Barnes to your quarters . Where were you ? Okay , so what 's happening ? What 's wrong ? Just trying to figure out what 's going on with Destiny . Where the hell were you ? ( DOOR OPENING ) What 's this ? I come here to think . And write on the walls ? Working on problems that have confused us since we set foot in this ship , Mr. Brody . This one has been particularly frustrating , and yet Chloe , she solved it in a minute flat . Whatever alien influence she 's under , it 's studying this ship . So you think she 's hijacked the ship 's system during one of her blackouts ? Something she could have set in motion days , perhaps even weeks ago . ( KNOCK AT DOOR ) This section 's off limits . - Wasn 't earlier . - It is now . - Why ? - Back to your quarters . You 're going to keep doing this , are you ? Pushing me . Get me to do something so you can lock me back up . Back to your quarters . You 're talking tough , you 're armed , you got your men here covering you . ( LAUGHS ) That 's true . Dismissed . ( GREER EXHALES ) You were saying ? ( DOOR OPENING ) You okay ? Just let me know and we 'll get you whatever you need . Colonel 's just doing this as a precaution . What do they think is happening to me ? They don 't know yet . I feel like I 'm slipping away , bit by bit . No . No , no . We 're going to figure this out . We 're going to fix it . I promise . WRAY : You can 't sleep ? I look at you , and I know it 's you , but still , I miss your face , your voice . This is hard . Probably worse on you than it is for me . This situation , it 's so easy to lose hope . I 've seen it in others . But what keeps me sane are these few moments we 're together . Being able to come home and see you and ... And hold you . Even if it 's just for a day or a minute , it 's ... It 's what 's keeping me going . ( SHARON SOBBING ) - I 'll be okay . - ( SIGHS ) I know . - I 'll be okay . I 'll be okay . - I know . JOHANSEN : It 's coming up now . There . - And she just sits there the whole time ? - Yes . In her earlier one , she wrote in the diary . But mostly she just sits or lies still , staring at the walls . I still can 't detect any physical changes in her . Without proper equipment , I don 't really know what else I can do . Colonel , I know you 're just doing this to keep her away from others , but quarantine is not a long-term solution . I know . - Nurse ? - Wait , no . Please , just listen , and then I 'll leave . I promise . Whether you believe me or not , the fact is , ( SIGHS ) I 'm worried . Eli 's worried . I can 't leave you here like this . He was all that I had . He 's why I got up in the morning . Never realized it fully until he was gone . Just tell me , will I ever see him again ? ( SOBBING ) I don 't know . ( SIGHS ) I can 't leave her like this . I can 't go back to that ship . - Lf I leave her , she 's going ... - WRAY : Eli . Eli , listen to me . Whatever happens , you will get through this . Maybe you could talk to her . Someone else from the Stargate program . Maybe then she 'll believe me . I 've got a better idea . I 'll call you right back . WRAY : I know it 's beyond her clearance . You 're just going to have to make an exception . He unlocked the ninth chevron . He 's quite possibly the most important person on that crew . We need him to be emotionally healthy , focused . You know what , I 'm not asking you . I 'm telling you , make this happen . ( EX CLAIMS SOFTLY ) Mrs. Wallace , welcome to the Destiny . Hi , Mom . ( GASPS ) Yeah . I 'm real . ( CRYING ) Eli . Eli . ( EXHALES ) Come here . I want to show you something . The other side of the universe , Mom . Pretty cool , isn 't it ? Yeah . I know . I was speechless at first , too , if you can believe that . It 's an amazing ship . We 're still trying to figure it out . See if there 's some way we can get back home . I 'll never stop trying . I promise . We 're going to be okay , Mom , you and me . MARYANN : I 'm so proud of you . SCOTT : Yeah , blew her mind , didn 't it ? ELI : Oh , yeah . She 's leaving the hospital tomorrow . Thanks for letting her come here . And don 't worry , she knows it 's a one-time thing . She won 't be asking to come by every week . Anyway , I owe you one . You owe Wray . She 's the one who made it happen . RUSH : ( ON RADIO ) Colonel Young , come in . Yeah , go ahead . I think I have a solution to Chloe 's condition . Well , let 's hear it . RUSH : The neural interface . The chair ? I believe it can cure her . Look , it 's relatively simple . From what I 've learned so far , I believe the chair will not allow any non-human to interface with it . There are safeguards built in that would destroy any alien life form that tries to use it . So the chair kills off any potential alien matter inside her , - while leaving her human side unaffected . - RUSH : Exactly . You " believe , " meaning you 're not sure ? - Well , no , I can 't be absolutely certain ... - It 's too dangerous . Look , I 've made improvements to the program I developed when I used the chair . They should prevent her from being harmed . I 'm now able to sever the connection externally , at any time . She shouldn 't have to sit in it very long , a few seconds at most . - Lf you can 't be 100 % sure , I don 't ... - It 's the best option anyone 's come up with . The only option . Colonel , you can 't force her to do this . Well , then , I 'll ask her . SCOTT : Are you sure you 're okay with this ? CHLOE : Yes , I 'm fine . It 's all right . The chair won 't activate till I input the proper command . - We 're ready . - Okay . Go ahead . ( BREATHING NERVOUSLY ) ( WHIRRING ) ( CHAIR DEACTIVATES ) ( CHLOE GASPS ) She 's breathing and her pulse is steady . - Did it work ? - RUSH : I believe so . But we 'll soon find out , won 't we ? ( KNOCKING ) - Hey . - Hey . I just wanted to thank you for pulling the strings to let my mom come here . I know it 's something that a lot of people here would want . ( EXHALES ) Does she believe you now ? Yeah . Yeah , she does . They 're discharging her from the hospital today . - Oh . - Anyway , it was great having you there to talk to . Someone who gets what we 're going through . We 'll keep an eye on her , 24 / 7 . - SCOTT : You okay ? - Yeah . Can I get you anything ? No . I 'm good . Just want to lie down for a little bit . ( CHLOE SIGHS ) I 'm fine , Matt . - Mrs. Wallace ? - Yes . I 'm Sharon Walker . - Your son Eli suggested ... - Oh , yes . Hello . We need to talk . I 'm not cured , am I ? No . ( INAUDIBLE ) GLORIA : Do you really think she can help you ? I do , yes . If she values her freedom , she 'll play along without telling anyone . I need her to be this way . For now , anyway . But can you trust her ?

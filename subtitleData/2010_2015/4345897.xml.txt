 RUSH : This is what Destiny intended from the moment it entered the star system . YOUNG : We are going to survive . We are going to make it home . I 'm telling you , the ship came here for a reason ! RUSH : Destiny is powered by the stars themselves . WRAY : He and Young are bumping heads , yes . Not sure which camp is the better choice . YOUNG : We just pretend nothing happened ? We need to be ready for the next encounter . For the sake of the crew . For the sake of the crew . You dreamt you were the spy who leaked everything about Icarus to the Lucian Alliance ? RUSH : No , no , no , not me . It wasn 't me . I was Colonel Telford . We know that the Goa 'uld had brainwashing technology . It is possible that the Alliance now has that capability . Once you are on Earth , you are on your own . Whoever you are , you must be using the Ancient communication stones . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Colonel Telford would never make such a mistake . ( EXCLAlMlNG ) We know that you are a traitor and a murderer . Now we know you 're a coward , too . ( TELFORD yelling ) RUSH : You 've found another Icarus planet . We 're all very excited to have Dr. Rush 's full cooperation . Kill me , and you kill Rush ! Begin venting the atmosphere in Colonel Telford 's quarters now . Young ! Open this damn door ! We both know you 're not going to kill me . Mr. Brody , this is Wray . - You need to restore the atmosphere ... - This is Young . Please disregard that request . ( PANTlNG ) WRAY : By letting this happen , you are participating in not only the murder of Colonel Telford , but Dr. Rush , a s well . Okay . Sir , you 've made your point . I 'm not trying to make a point . - Come on . Open the door , sir , please . - I know what I 'm doing . - What you 're doing is killing him ! - I know that , Lieutenant . - WRAY : Brody ! - What should we do ? The Colonel 's bluffing . He 's not going to kill him . ( GASPlNG ) What 's happening to him ? ( continues GASPlNG ) All right . No . Sir , I cannot ... ( STOPS breathing ) You 've killed him . Brody . YOUNG : Come on , David . Come on . David , come on . TELFORD : You 're all in danger . YOUNG : What ? - They 're coming . - Who 's coming ? The Lucian Alliance . They 're coming to take Destiny . YOUNG ON PA : We 've been informed that this ship faces an incursion by armed forces of the Lucian Alliance , the group responsible for the attack on lcarus Base . All military personnel onboard ha ve been placed on high alert . If the enemy has acquired the means to dial Destiny , their point of ingress will be the stargate . Brody , we 're clear . YOUNG : So , the Gate Room is off-limits . All surrounding corridors ha ve been placed in lockdown . Come on ! Come on , let 's go ! YOUNG : No one may enter without proper authorization . I 've provided Homeworld Security with intel on the planet from which the Lucian Alliance intends to launch their assault . They 're dispatching forces as I speak . YOU NG : The best-ca se scenario , Earth forces take the launch point intact and we gain a supply line from home . The worst-case scenario is that our forces don 't make it before the attack is launched , in which case we 'll have to deal with them on our end . In that event , all non-military personnel will be ordered back to your quarters , where you will remain until the situation has been resolved . Make no mistake , this will be dealt with swiftly and decisively . Thank you . That is all . Colonel . Only a couple of hours ago , Colonel Telford admitted to being a mole for the Lucian Alliance . And now , suddenly , he 's on our side ? YOUNG : Yeah . WRAY : You trust him ? I didn 't say that . - What in the hell was that ? - " What in the hell was that , sir ? " - All you had to do was tell me . - I was keeping you out of it . You didn 't have to . If I 'd known that killing him and bringing him back was the only way to beat that brainwashing technology , I 'd have been behind you 100 % . So , you 'll follow orders as long as I explain everything to you beforehand ? - No , sir , that is not what I meant . - Well , that 's good , because if it was , we 'd have a problem , Lieutenant . Do we have a problem ? - No , sir ... - Good , because now is not the time for that . - No headaches or blurred vision ? - No . I told you , I 'm fine . Well , Rush is fine . I 'll find out about me when I switch back . Look , I really need to go and ... T.J. , can you give us a minute ? - Yes , sir . - Thanks . How are you feeling , David ? - Confused . - I bet . You went the whole nine yards . To the brink and back . I had to . You know , in my defense , it wasn 't the first thing I tried . Yeah . Thanks for that . At least the brainwashing explains why you 've been such an ass . I 've read the SG mission reports of that method being done in the past . I just never ... You have no idea what it 's like to remember things that you 've done , that ... Terrible things . You weren 't yourself , David . - You 've got to send me back . - Not yet . - I 've done all that I can on this end . - I 've already killed you once . I 'm more useful to you in my own body , back there with them , Everett , you know that . How the hell else are you gonna get Rush back ? - Listen ... - You 've got to get him out of there . David , listen to me , you 've just come back from the dead . I want you to get your strength back first . Excuse us . T.J. , listen , when they come , I want you here , safe . Safe ? Look , if they break containment , there could be wounded . We 're going to need you . What we 'll need is a real doctor . - You 're up for this . - Not even close . What are you planning to do ? Evacuate the atmosphere in the Gate Room the minute they step through . Kill them all , you mean . You think I have a choice ? If you 're asking for forgiveness , I can 't help you there either . - T.J. - I 'll do my best . KlVA : You 're back . That was me . I had to see whether you were faking . Well , I wasn 't . I apologize . Back to work . I know . Running planetary scans . Whoa . CARTER : Sir , it looks like the intel is good . The planet 's laced with naquadria deposits . We 're also reading a huge energy signature emanating from what looks like a pyramid . Pyra m id ? That takes m e ba ck . Unfortunately , the complex inside is shielded against beaming technology . So , Rush can ' t be beamed out . No , sir . We 'll have to go in with ground forces from the outside . All right , Colonel . You have a go . ( RUMBLlNG ) What was that ? KlVA : We 're under attack . Can we dial the ninth chevron ? Not without blowing everything up . Dial it . Get ready ! We 're going now ! JACKSON : The Lucian Alliance is an organization ofhumans from a number of sovereign planets who ha ve taken control of the resources and technology ... The Alliance is made up ofpower-hungry violence as a means of enforcing their dominion . - The Air Force video ? - ell : Y eah . I 'm just seeing if there 's anything in here that might help . ... control a sizable army and numerous Ha ' tak vessels , or former Goa ' uld motherships . - What 's he going to do ? - The Colonel ? They 're sending an army . What do you think he 's going to do ? This is it . - It 's happening now ? - Yeah . Go ! Radio back when you reach the other side . And take him with you . ( GRUNTlNG ) Colonel Young . I see them , Eli . All personnel , report to your designated areas . This is not a drill . Defense teams stand by . MAN 1 : Copy that . Go , go ! - Which button ? - BRODY : This one . How long will it take till we reach vacuum ? - A minute or so ? - That 's about right . BRODY : Colonel . Defense teams stand by to secure prisoners on my order . Copy that . ( GUN RACKS ) Monitor from here . Stay on the radio . Got it . - RUSH : What happened ? - Colonel ? - No , no , it 's me . - Rush ? Yeah . The ship , the Lucian Alliance ... Yeah , no , we know everything . Telford told us . So what are we doing about it , then ? Let 's just say it 'll all be over in a few minutes . ( PEOPLE shouting ORDERS ) ( ALARM SOUNDS ) Colonel , I 'm reading a huge energy spike . At this rate , they 've got less than a minute before their core goes up . Get our people out of the shielded areas and beam them back to the ship , now ! The core is going to go critical . I can 't stop it . Still no signal from the other side ? ( RUMBLlNG ) Get as many of our people through as you can . - Load it up . - Watch out ! - Watch it , watch it . - MAN 2 : Clear there . Colonel , we still have two 302s on their way back from the planet . We can 't wait . Get us out of here . ( MAN screaming ) MAN : No ! Aren 't we supposed to go to our quarters ? These are my quarters , and I 'm not going anywhere . - Colonel ? - They brought Rush along with them . We 're going to have to do this the hard way . KlVA : What did you do to the gate ? TELFORD : It wasn 't me . You killed over a hundred of my men ! It was Rush ! Massin . Massin , your father 's name , it was my password . Gate travel must have severed the link . It 's me . Telford ? YOUNG : Lucian Alliance forces , you are surrounded and sealed in . You will also find the intel provided by Colonel Telford is now useless . Lay down your weapons in front of the doors and step back into the center of the room with your hands on your heads , or we will vent the entire compartment to space . - Ca n they do it ? - Y es . Then they should have . Colonel , they 're up to something . Talk to me . They 've got something to open the doors ! Vent the atmosphere in the Gate Room . Brody , do it now . BRODY : Too late . Take cover ! Get back ! YOUNG : Go ! Uh , Rush , you should stay here . No , no . The ship 's under attack . Rush ! Rush ! ( GROANS ) - Okay , Eli , it 's time to go . - No , just wait . No , Eli , let 's go . Now ! Yeah . Yeah . ELl : There 's an elevator this way . ( ell PANTlNG ) CHLOE : Oh , God . YOUNG : Go ! JOHANSEN : Rush ! Wait ! BRODY ON KlNO : You 're welcome . Want to get the hell out of there now ? ELl : Chloe , you 've been shot . Sorry , sorry . See ? It 's okay . You 'll be ... You 'll be okay . Eli , I ... Okay . Hey , you 'll be fine . You 'll be fine , all right ? Chloe ? I 'll be right back . Okay ? MAN 4 : This way . Let 's go ! WOMAN 1 : Over here . Colonel Young ? Who is this ? Commander Kiva of the Lucian Alliance forces . We will not be complying with your request to surrender . We barely made hyperspace . This time it was even closer . What about casualties ? Two of my 302s couldn 't make it back , and if Rush was still on the planet ... I 'm sorry , Sam . Yes , sir . Did any of them make it to Destiny ? I haven 't heard . MAN 1 : Hands behind your back . Do it ! BRODY : So much for that . Why didn 't you evacuate the compartment to space ? - That was the plan . - He didn 't do it to save you . Not me . The connection was severed the minute I stepped through the gate . Give me the lay of the land . RUSH : This is the Gate Room . They also occupy the surrounding corridors . They had advanced further , but they pulled back . Just took what they could hold with limited manpower . That 's smart . BRODY : Once they retreated , I locked down the area behind them . Given the technology at their disposal , it won 't stop them , but it should give us some breathing room . RUSH : The prisoners are being held here . Between them and us , 30 feet of corridor either way . Well , the second we hit that outside section , those hostages are as good as dead . - SCOTT : Colonel . - Yeah ? I 've done a head count . We have 1 2 missing and presumed captured , including Riley , T.J. , Eli , and Chloe . ELl : Come on ! Eli ? Hey . Hey . - What happened ? - You were shot . I stopped the bleeding . No , you 're fine . Look up here . Hey , look at me . Look at me . Where are we ? I don 't know . I 've never been to this part of the ship before . I don 't think anyone has . I just pressed some random buttons . We can 't get back . I 'm guessing someone locked out elevator access . Us or them ? Yeah , that 's the problem . I just need to get to a window , get an idea of where we are and then we can walk back . ( GRUNTS ) Oh , no , no , no , no . I 've got you . Come on . Come here . Ready ? Here we go . One , two , three . - ( GROANlNG ) - Okay . Okay . - Lean on me . - Okay . - I 've got you . Ready ? - Yeah . There you go . Colonel Young . Go ahead . Here 's how I see the situation . We have the Gate Room and some of your people . You hold the Control Interface Room , which , I 'm told , is the ship 's nerve center . YOUNG : What do you want ? We came here for the same reasons you did . We don 't want to hurt anyone . You 're welcome to stay aboardDestiny and help us realize the potential ofher discovery . Lay down your weapons and join us . Or , if you prefer , we can drop you off at the next inhabitable world of your choosing . Or I vent the atmosphere in the sections you 're occupying and keep the ship . If you had that in you , Colonel , you would have done it already . The point is , I have the ability to end this conversation right now . - Sergeant ? - She wanted to see you , sir . - Wouldn 't shut up , in fact . - As you were , Sergeant . We are way past the point of fighting our way out of this situation . We need to negotiate with these people . And I think I should be the one to ... Yeah , yeah . No , I think you 're right . Him . Him . And her . That 's a mistake . ( COCKS pistol ) It 's a demonstration . All it will do is force their hand . Do you want control of the ship or not ? WRAY : They have some of our people . YOUNG : But we have some of theirs . So the first thing we need to do is suggest an exchange . - Do you think they 'll do it ? - No . But I think it 's worth a shot . TELFORD : This is the Control Interface Room . This is the Gate Room . If we cut our way through the wall here , we can flank them . I can lead a team . That will reduce our numbers here . We take the Control Interface Room , we won 't need them here . The ship will be ours . KlVA : These sections are in red . That section of corridor is exposed to space . The ship 's shield will hold long enough for us to pass . We will slowly vent atmosphere to space , yes , but we could seal the corridor again after we 've taken the ship . - KlVA : Take six men . - I 'll need twice that ... Six . And if anything goes wrong , these three die . Not her . She 's a medic . We can use her in the event ... WRAY ON radio : Commander Kiva . - Who is this ? - My name is Camile Wray . I am the civilian authority aboard this ship . I 'd like to act as an intermediary to resolve this issue without further bloodshed . Colonel Young will not transfer control of this ship to you . KlVA : And you will ? No . But I will expedite a prisoner exchange . Your people for ours . If I release my prisoners , Colonel Young will not hesitate to vent this compartment . You have 12 of our people . We have only four of yours . I propose an even trade , four for four . This way , you maintain your advantage and gain some much-needed manpower . Colonel Young agrees with this ? In our society the military takes orders from civilian leadership . I 'll consider it . Nice job . That should buy us some time . Look , you 're trying to save lives here . Obviously , that 's a good thing . But even if she agrees to the four , which is doubtful , she won 't go any farther than that . Once the equation tips to the point of acceptable losses ... No , no , no . There will be no acceptable losses . Colonel Young has already determined what that number is . He knows the chances of us winning without loss of life are practically nil . So limit our losses , yes , all that we can , but eventually , you 're going to have to do something ... You don 't know what you 're talking about . You forget , I 've recently been one of your acceptable losses ... You knew what you were getting yourself into , Rush . You should have disconnected the stones and got me out ! You have no clue what you 're talking about ! Stop this now , please ! I am going to save every one of those hostages , and I 'm going to retake this ship . Do you understand me ? All right , Telford has convinced her that he is still with them , otherwise he would be dead by now . Sooner or later he will make his move . So , we are to gamble this ship and all of our lives in the hope that some traitor has had a change of heart . ( breathing heavily ) ELl : Look at that . I guess those elevators go more than just up and down . Yes , right there . - You good ? - Yeah . I must have hit a few buttons I wasn 't supposed to press . Is the air getting thin ? Life support isn 't working out here . How do you know ? I was the one who shut it off . Rush 's orders . I mean , there 's air . There just isn 't any new air being pumped in . - So we need to keep moving ? - Yeah . ( EXCLAlMS ) - Okay ? - I don 't know if I can . No problem . I got you . This is my lieutenant , Varro . Save him . He 's badly wounded . At even the slightest hint of trouble , Lieutenant ... I 'll bring you back , sir . I need to speak to General O 'Neill . O 'NElLL : Second-guessing a decision is a waste of time . I 'm not there . But I 'm starting to wonder if maybe I should be . I can 't speak to that , sir . - This should be done , Colonel . Over . - Yes , sir . At the time , I believed that venting the Gate Room would kill both Dr. Rush and Colonel Telford . - They deserved a chance . - We lost two 302 pilots - sent to stop the attack . - I 'm sorry . Colonel Carter knew she 'd lose her ship if she tried to save them , but it was the right decision . Yes , sir . Are you up for this , Everett ? Yes , sir . Because somebody will take your place if you 're not . I 'm not going to let anybody take that ship , sir . Then get your ass back there . TELFORD : We 're good . What are you doing ? Just checking to make sure we 're headed in the right direction . This way . There 's no countdown . VOLKER : What ? We dropped out of FTL because someone was gating in . Why haven 't we jumped back ? Someone just activated a console in one of the access corridors . Colonel , a console just came on using Telford 's code . They 're in a cordoned-off section coming our way . That 's his move . - It 's cold . - Really ? - ell : Okay . Watch your foot . Good ? - Yeah . We have to be careful moving through sections . There 's a reason we 've never been out this far . A ton of compartments are de-pressurized . - Okay ? - Thank you . Hang on . Okay . - Ready ? - Yeah . Okay . More dark and gloomy . We 're good . Coming ? Gotcha . Good ? Gotcha . - ell : How are you doing ? - I 'm okay . ELl : You sure ? Stand by . Yes , sir . We 're good to go . Ready . GREER : Just give the word , sir . - It 's locked down . - I 'll handle it . Okay , get ready . ( screaming ) SCOTT : What was that ? MAN : This way . Let 's go . This way . YOUNG : Ready ? What happened ? - You didn 't do that ? - What is that ? Just a minute ago , it was a man . You need to stand down till we figure this out . This is Young . Everybody stand down . - Throw me a radio . - Radio ? Three clicks , go to channel six . We 're going to have to try this again . CHLOE : Let 's stop . ELl : No . I 'm fine . - Eli , you don 't ... - Seriously , this is nothing . ( GRUNTS ) Once , I climbed the Redridge Mountains on my way to Stonard - with a full pack . - Where 's that ? World of Warcraft . Wow , that ... That must 've given you quite the sense of accomplishment . - Eli ... - Okay , okay . - Okay , a little break . A little break . - Yeah . All right , all right . ( BOTH panting ) So , what do you think is happening ? - We 've probably won by now . - You think so ? If we won , then why haven 't we been rescued ? Well , first , they have to figure out what to do with the prisoners , and then there 's that whole post-victory celebration . I mean , streamers everywhere . I 'm so tired . You 're still ... You 're still losing blood . - I wasn 't able to stop it completely . - Eli ... Hey . I 'm going to take care of you . It wasn 't them . Now , I don 't know what happened to our man , but I know that they had nothing to do with it . They don 't have anything that could do that to a person . Are you telling me that they had nothing to do with this ? ( GARBLED static ) TELFORD : What happened ? BRODY : Overload in the power relays proceeded by temporary disruption of all shipboard systems , lights to life support . - Well , how the hell did they manage that ? - They didn 't . - Well , then , what caused it ? - That 's what I 'm trying to figure out . They 're making their move . It wouldn 't be that obvious . KlVA : Colonel Young . Would you care to tell me what 's going on ? We don 't know . One of my men is dead . You need to know that we had nothing to do with that . Yes , so I 'm told . I 'm going to ask for a show of good faith . What do you want ? Colonel ? Lieutenant . How are you ? I 'm fine . We 're all fine . What is it that they want ? Some of their people are injured badly . I 'm going to need medical supplies to help them . What will this accomplish ? WRAY : A goodwill gesture doesn 't have to accomplish anything . Of course it does ! So they lack medical supplies ? Who knows what else they might lack ? Food ? Water ? Now , in time , they 're gonna get desperate . They 'll make their move , and when they do , they 'll be dealing with the hostages first . There 's only one way this is going to end if we wait . How do you know that ? We don 't even know what 's going on with the ship ! All the more reason to act now . Rush is right . We have to take them down , and we have to do it right now . english - US - SDH

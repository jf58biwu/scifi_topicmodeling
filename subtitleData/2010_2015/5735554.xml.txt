 to give them super strength . You know , I thought that was to numb the sense of impending doom . Exactly . We 're just five friends on a night out , having a good time . ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) I need the toilet . Go on then . You 've earned it . Huh ? You 're doing really good , Oliver . ( SIGHS ) He didn 't make it this far last time . I 'm proud of him . You 're enjoying this , aren 't you ? Yeah , five guys on a night out , having a great time . Pretending to have a great time . Are you pretending ? If we get out of here alive , I 'm going to kill you . We 're still in the dark , Gary . Yeah , our families could be in danger for all we know . I know , my mum could be dead . For reals this time . Hey , why don 't we just ask somebody ? Who ? The Reverend Green . Come on . Wait . What the fuck are you doing ? I 'm going to go and have a little chat with The Reverend Green . You 're going to buy drugs ? I am going to go over there and subtly check if that is The Reverend Green and if it is , I can ask him what 's going on , and possibly buy some drugs . But what if he 's one of them ? No , me and The Reverend had a highly sophisticated code when discussing the purchase of herbal narcotics . If he doesn 't understand me , it means he 's one of them and I will simply walk away . Ah ! Have you got any drugs ? I don 't do that anymore , Gary . Do what ? That . That why you 're in a suit , is it ? 'Cause drug dealing is not good enough for you ? There are no drug dealers anymore , Gary . I 've got a properjob in a proper office . You had a proper office . That was the gents ' toilets . Nothing wrong with doing your business in the toilet . Look , a lot has changed since you have left . I know . How much do you know ? A little . How much is a little ? The town has been taken over by robots full of blue stuff . Shh . Keep your voice down . You don 't even know what you 're talking about . Tell us then . Well , they 're not robots . Do you even know what robot means ? Course I do . It 's like , " Hello , lam a robot . " It means " slave " and believe me , they are not slaves . Are you their prisoner ? No , lam very happy . ( SCOFFS ) Tell your face . Hey ! What 's going on ? The town 's been invaded by robots who aren 't robots and The Rev 's their prisoner . I am not . We 're leaving first thing . We can get you out of here . I 'm not going . It 's not what you think . This is for all our benefit . You 've said too much , Trevor . Yeah , put a cork in it , Trevor . I 'm just trying to help . It 's not your place to help . They will have everything in hand . Are you guys robots ? Well , the word robot actually comes from an old Czech word robotnik ... ... meaning slave . And we are not slaves . We are very , very happy . And not robots . Oh , my God , are these guys robots ? Shut up about robots ! I say we shut up about everything ! ( PHONE RINGING ) ( INDISTINCT ) Trevor . It 's your supervisor . Hello , Trevor . Hello , sir . But ... I understand . Thanks a bunch . What did I miss ? Your friends trying to help . We don 't need your help . Well , what should we do ? I suggest you get on your way . I think we should do what he says . Okay - ( GARY CHATTERING ) GARY : Here we go . Come on ! Gary . Gary ! Let 's just get in and out of this one , yeah ? No more making new friends . Gentlemen ! The prodigal sons return ! What will it be , one of our guest ales perchance ? Might I recommend five pints of Crowning Glory ? Rather fitting , wouldn 't you say , Gary ? What ? Sorry . What ? It 's a delightful brew . Hoppy , nutty , foamy . Does it have a surprisingly fruity note that lingers on the tongue ? You 're obviously a connoisseur . ( LAUGHS ) Then you 'll already know that it 's a rare treat for rogues , reverends , royalty and all good folks between . Five of those , please . Welcome home , boys . I don 't remember him being that friendly . He 's obviously one of them . How can he be ? He remembered me . We don 't know what they remember . OLIVER : Maybe they have selective memories . Yeah , like what 's his name ? Me . Maybe he 's one of the others . Like The Reverend . It is very hard to tell , isn 't it ? Yeah , I mean , is he one of them or is he one of them ? Wait , wait , which ones are the thems again ? Well , they 're both thems , aren 't they ? But there 's two ways of saying it . Is he one of them or is he one of them ? We need different terms . One for the people who aren 't robots and one for the robots who aren 't robots . All right , we need to be able to differentiate between them , them and us . Yeah , I think the pronouns are really confusing . ALL : Yes . I don 't even know what a pronoun is . It 's a word that can function by itself as a noun which refers to something else in the discourse . I don 't get it . You just used one . Did I ? Yeah . " it " is a pronoun . What is ? It . Is it ? Christ . Look , we just need a fucking word so we can identify who 's who . He 's a blank , she 's a blank , those two people are definitely blanks . Sam . I got this , Steve . All right , Sam ? Oh , crumbs . H ° W ' $ Yourni ht - ( sums ) g gmng ? Good . Sort of . What do you mean " sort of " ? Well , it 's weird , isn 't it ? You come back and everything 's the same , but sort of different . Different how ? Just weird . How weird ? What are you getting at , Gary ? Come with me . Fuck 's sake , Gary , take a hint . It 's all right , I 'm not trying to have sex with you . Why are we in the disabled toilets then ? There 's something I need to tell you right now , unless you do want to have sex , in which case I 'll tell you afterwards . Tell me right now . Have you noticed anything creepy about The Twins apart from the fact that they 're twins ? Just because they 're twins doesn 't automatically make them creepy . It does a little bit . You had sex with them . A , I did not , and , B , how did you know about that ? A , it 's a small town , B , I 'm not stupid and , C , they told me . Right . Well , I did once , but I was wasted , which was creepy because it was like there was four of them . I am not proud of it . I am a bit . Is this what you wanted to tell me ? No , this is ... ( SAM SLAPS ) ( GARY SCREAMS ) Are you okay , Sam ? Are you okay , Sam ? I need a cigarette . Nobots ? How about Fauxbots ? I think we should get away from the whole robots thing . Steven ? What 's he up to ? Oh , don 't worry , he 's probably just trying to fuck Oliver 's sister . And ) ' - Oh , my God , that man is full of shit . I know that 's not a surprise to you . What did he say , Sam ? What did he say , Sam ? He said that Newton Haven has been taken over by robots full of blue stuff and if we don 't do what they say , they will make us their prisoners . Did you believe him ? Did you believe him ? No , of course not . Did you believe him ? Did you believe him ? What ? ( SCREAMS ) ( GRUNTING ) ( GASPS ) See ? Come on , Sam . You know better than to believe Gary King . Oh , crumbs . Sam ! ( MUFFLED ) God ! You creepy bitches , get off ! ( GRUNTING ) Chuck us a ciggie . Oh . Gary , what 's happening ? I told you in the disableds . Oh , yes , you did . We should get inside , eh ? Otherwise people are going to ask what the hell 's going on . What the hell 's going on ? Steve , I got this . Got what ? Sam , he 's not good enough for you . What ? What ? We 've been through some crazy shit tonight and it 's really put things in perspective for me , and if everything is as fucked up as it seems , then there 's something I need to tell you . You might think this is because I 've had seven pints , but it 's not . It 's not . I 'm in love with you , Sam . I always have been , and it breaks my heart to see you waste your affections on Gary fucking King . Hey , that 's a bit harsh . Oh , no , you 've got it all wrong . There 's nothing between ... And while I 'm being honest , just to lay it all out there , lam currently seeing a fitness instructor . She 's 26 years old , but I would drop her in a heartbeat if it meant that I had one last chance with you . Steven , there 's nothing between me and Gary King . ( BOTH GRUNT ) Oh , fuck . ( GRUNTING ) ( SCREAMS ) Sorry . ( SCREAMS ) Hey ! Get your feet off her ! Pop its head off ! Pop its head off like an aspirin bottle . ( SCREAMS ) Blue-bloods ? Nothing suggested in the last three minutes has been better than Smashy-Smashy Egg Men . Nothing . What the hell 's going on ? Did you guys think of a name for the robots who aren 't robots ? I 'm afraid we 've drawn a blank . Well , we just had a barney with two blanks in the beer garden . SAM : We have to leave now ! GARY : Agreed . Let 's hit The Mermaid . Wait , what ? Number eight . " Number eight " ? Oh , fuck . Andy , what 's happening ? Gary thinks we should keep on with the crawl because they know what we 're doing , but they don 't know that we know what they 're doing . And basically no one else has a better idea , so fuck it . What ? Wait ! SAM : Guys ! Guys ! I 've got a better idea . I 'm parked right round here somewhere . Haul it . Just go ! Steven , tell them ! Gary said they 'll get us if we try and leave now . We 're way past leaving now . Come on . ( LOUD MUSIC PLAYING ) ( LAUGHS ) Oh , yeah . This is what the kids want . This is a bit mad , isn 't it ? This is perfect . We can hide out in here . I 'll get the drinks in . Good plan , O-Man . Hey ! Keep an eye out for blanks . You 've got it . Why didn 't you say anything ? About what ? About what you said in the garden . I always wanted to . It just never seemed like the right moment . Something always got in the way . Here you go , get these down you . Thanks . Steven ? Please ! I have so much to live for ! It 's me , you numpty . Basil ! I knew seeing your faces again would spell trouble . Wait . How do I know it 's really you ? Because I 'm the only one who 's going to tell you the truth about Newton Haven . Now , do you recall the events of the evening of June the 22nd , 1990 ? No , but I know a man who does . Here you go . Hey . See anyone we know ? The Marmalade Sandwich . The Marmalade Sandwich . They look good . It 's the lights . It 's the drink . Who cares what it is ? SAM : Steven ? Steven ? That was the night they arrived . Remember the shooting star ? That was them . Nothing happened at first . They were getting ready , burrowing in underground , preparing . Not long after you lot left , people started to change . Just one or two at first , then more . They replaced people of influence , taking over the institutions , remaking , remodeling , refurbishing . Doing everything they could to make us join them . ( LOUD MUSIC PLAYING ) I can 't find Steven . Where are the others ? They 're blending in . Oh , crumbs . It 's not like the replacements were evil , far from it . People got a lot friendlier . That 's how they do it . It 's not an invasion , it 's a merger . They don 't want to get rid of us , not if they can help it . They just want to make us more like them . Change the way we think . Bring us into line with all the others . Become another link in their chain . Which is fine , unless you say no . That 's when you get replaced . Once they get your DNA , they 've got you . How do they do that ? BASH ; Any way they like . Blood tests , the nit nurse , sweat , kissing , saliva on the rim of a glass . Why do you think I drink with this crazy straw ? Not so crazy now , is it ? If you 're not on their side , they 'll create a version that is . They can bring you back exactly the same or even make you young again . It looks like you , it even has your memories , but really it 's just a vessel to spread their message . Trust , love , respect , desire . Replaced in the name of progress . So , what happens to the people who get replaced ? The empties ? Don 't ask me what happens to them . Why , what happens to the empties ? I told you not to ask me that ! Go ! Get out , before it 's too late ! Basil ? I said go ! This just can 't be good . Sam , who was the boy that you liked in sixth form ? Adrian ? Adrian Keane . Why ? He 's over there . Hey , Sam . How 's life ? Sam , we have to get out of here ! We have to get out of here ! Where are the others ? They 're blending in . Oh , fuck ! Gary ! No , just one more song . Gary , she 's a blank ! Don 't be so judgmental . Oh , for fuck ... Oh , yeah . Come on . Still got it . Enough 's enough . Let 's go . Whoa , whoa , whoa , hold up . Hold up . ( CHUCKLES ) Where are you all going ? ALL : We 're leaving . Really ? What happened ? Adrian Keane was in that bar . Prick . I thought you liked Adrian Keane . Adrian Keane is dead . Oh , God . Adrian Keane died in a motorbike accident in Italy eight years ago . Did he ? They must have had his DNA on file . That 's how they were able to replicate him . They know how to get to us , man . They know everything . They didn 't know Adrian was dead . They knew enough to tempt us . They knew these three would fall for a bunch of girls in school uniform . Hey , who wouldn 't ? Am I right ? Fuck , yeah . STEVEN : We 've gotta get out of town , we 've gotta get beyond it before it 's too late . OLIVER : Where are you getting all this from ? STEVEN : Basil . Mad Basil ? He of the Bermuda Rhombus and the Aqua Nazis ? Another good name for the band , Steve . You 're putting our lives in the hands of a crazy old man ? He 's not crazy ! No , maybe he 's not . Or maybe he 's a blank trying to lure us to the edge of town , onto those dark country roads where they can deal with us . Yeah , we could end up dead in a field . I hate fields . OLIVER : Yes . My thoughts precisely . Steven 's right . We should go . No , we 're going to The Beehive . Gary 's plan is still the best we have . Wait a minute . The 1990-model Oliver was out of commission by this point in the evening . What are you saying ? I like the new you . Huh . Come on . This is a mistake , isn 't it ? GARY : Hold up ! Just stick with me . GARY : Andy , come on ! Here we go . Pub number nine . ( LAUGHING ) FUCK yes ! That 's the spirit , Pete ! Spirits ! We should do chasers . Who is this guy ? Come on . Andy ! It can 't start without you . You what ? We can 't start without you . Now then . Whose round is it ? It 's mine . Mr. Shepherd ! Is it Mr. Shepherd ? Why don 't you kids join me ? You look like you could do with a drink . Now , let 's have a little chat about your future , shall we , hmm ? Uh , Mr. Shepherd ? Please , call me Guy . All right . Guy ... ( BOTH SNIGGER ) Look at you . Are you a robot ? Does anyone know what robot means ? Yeah . I do ! Yes , Gary . It means " slave . " Oh , very good , Gary . Are you a robot , sir ? No , Peter , of course I 'm not a robot . Sir ? Yes , Steven . But you 're on their side , though ? This is not about sides , Steven . It 's not about shirts versus skins . It 's about working together as one team . I know it may seem a bit weird and a little bit scary , but please believe me , it 's quite the opposite . They 're here to help . To straighten us out . To prepare us for the big league . They 've seen something in us , a potential . There 's a vast community of worlds up there , living together , peacefully , cooperatively . And guess what ? They want us along for the ride . Pretty cool , eh , gang ? ( LAUGHING ) So , ( CLEARS THROAT ) they 're not here to harm us ? Far from it , O-Man . No , they 're here to help . I 'm not saying they 're afraid to get tough . I certainly had to get tough with you in my day . And what one amongst you wouldn 't thank me for it ? Hmm ? In some respects , they 're a lot like teachers . Stern , yes . A little frightening . But it 's all for our betterment . So , what do you say we all go somewhere and talk about this properly ? That wasn 't properly ? Well , I think it 's pretty clear , guys , what Mr. Shepherd is trying to say is that ... ( ALL GASP ) Andy ! What the fuck ? Yes , Andy . What the fuck ? WTF ? ( SCREAMS ) ( ALARMS RINGING ) Humans , you leave us no recourse . If you will not join us willingly , we will be forced to use other means of persuasion . Now , please ... ( SCREAMS ) I fucking hate this town ! ( GRUNTING ) ( SCREAMS ) ( SCREAMING ) Oh , oh ! Oh , crumbs , you 're heavy . Sorry . Motherfucker ! ( EXCLAIMS ) Andy ! Twist the melon , man ! Yeah ! ( GRUNTS ) Sam , this is no way for a family to behave . Sam , I 'm disappointed in you . O-Man ! ( GRUNTING ) Okay , And ) ' - Break it up . It doesn 't have to be like this . It could be so much simpler , so completely painless . If only you 'd see the light . OLIVER : Yes . See , it 's not about conflict , it 's about togetherness . Yes . Let 's try this again , shall we ? How about another round ? Nah , we 're done here . Yes , Gary , that appears to be the case . ( SNAPS ) ( ALARM RINGING ) The Smokehouse ! What ? Just do it ! Come on ! This way ! BOTH : Humans , this is your final warning . Failure to comply will result in your ... ( GASPS ) Humans , obey now , or face the consequences . Let 's go ! ( GRUNTING ) Shit . Oh , look , there 's my car ! Let 's climb down the drainpipe . I 've got a better idea . ( CAR ALARM WAILING ) Climb down the drainpipe . Okay , just 9 ° - Wait . What about the others ? Leave ' em with me , okay ? I got this . Are you sure ? Yeah , I always land on my feet . I don 't know if that 's true , Gary . Just go . Will you find out what happened to my brother ? Yeah , of course , of course , and I 'll look after Stevie for you , eh ? He 's a good guy . He 's better than me . Gary , you 're not a bad person , but you 're not boyfriend material . The whole " free spirit quick one in the disabled toilets " thing is kinda cool when you 're 17 , but not when you 're facing 40 . There comes a time when you have to go forwards and not backwards . Maybe if I hadn 't left you behind that night , things would all be different . It 's not all about that night , Gary . Isn 't it ? It doesn 't have to be . We 'll always have the disableds , though , won 't we ? Yeah . Yeah , we 'll always have the disableds . ( STARTS ENG I N E ) Oh , no . ( GRUNTING ) STEVEN : Where 's Sam ? I put her in her car . You did what ? I put her in her car . I just told her to leave . You just sent away the only one of us sober enough to drive ? Yeah . You just couldn 't stand the fact that she might prefer me to you . That 's not true . It is true , Gary ! I was getting somewhere . We held hands . I was just trying to help ! You were trying to help yourself , more like ! Jesus , I do something right for a change and you fuckers get on my case . Wow , that 's the first time I 've ever heard you admit being wrong . I said I did something right ! Yeah , " for a change " . GARY : So ? Meaning the rest of the time you 're wrong . Not necessarily . Look , I just thought it was best to keep her out of harm 's way . And what about us , Gary ? Aren 't we in harm 's way ? We 're all right , Pete . Come on , we 're The Five Musketeers . No , we 're the Four Musketeers . Wait , how do we know you put her in the car ? How do we know you 're you ? Of course I 'm me ! Well , who the fuck are you , Gary ? I 'm Gary King . There 's only one Gary King . How do I know you guys are you ? We 've been together the whole time . You might all not be you . How did you know O-Man wasn 't O-Man ? Because his birthmark was back . GARY : What does that prove ? Because of what Basil said . They make a copy from your DNA . That 's why he had his birthmark . He was new , like a baby . Like a man-baby . Like a " maybe " . Oliver with none of the shit that had happened to the real Oliver . ANDY : The laser surgery ! So the blanks really are just blank ? No wear and tear , no scars . Steven , in 1987 we were playing cricket and I accidentally pushed you onto a broken bottle that nearly went up your ass . So ? Show us your bum . Very nice . Thank you . Pete , you got that 50cc Suzuki in 1988 , and you let me have a go on it and I ran over your leg . What the fuck ? Oh , wait , it 's the other one . ( CHUCKLES ) Andy , in 1986 we re-enacted the Knife Game from Aliens and I stabbed you in the middle finger . How about December 1997 , when you DDT ! and I drove you to the hospital four times over the limit and I ended up rolling the car and almost severing my femoral artery , at which point you made a miraculous fucking recovery and ran off into the night , leaving me to get arrested after 12 hours of life-saving surgery ? Either one of those will do . Thank you . What about you ? That 's easy . That could have been drawn on . Aren 't all tattoos drawn on ? Yeah . ANDY : Show us your arm . What ? Show us your arm . No , no . You fell off stage at the fifth-year ball fucking around and dislocated your elbow . You 've got a scar where they put the metal plate in . I don 't have to show you anything , all right ? I 'm Gary King . I know I 'm me . If I 'm not me , then how do I know that carved into that beam above your head are the words " King Gary " ? But it doesn 't say " King Gary " . Yes , it does . Doesn 't it ? No. it says " King Gay " . Some cunt scrubbed out the " R " ! That was me . GARY : Why ? " King Gay " . ( LAUGHS ) That means fuck-all anyway . Mr. Shepherd remembered stuff , so did Oliver . Selective memory , remember ? We don 't see you for years and you just pitch up and bring us here . You better come out with some hard evidence that you 're human , otherwise we 're going to find out for ourselves . You want evidence ? There ! That proves I 'm human ! It proves you 're stupid . Exactly ! Ow ! ALL : It 's Gary . It 's Gary . ANDY : The whole town 's out looking for us . That 's a good thing . If everybody 's outside , that means nobody 's inside . Gary , wait ! Fuck ! ( LAUGHING ) ANDY : Gary , Gary ! What do you mean " nobody 's inside " ? I mean we can still do this ! STEVEN : Do what exactly ? Oh , we 're still on the crawl . ( LAUGHING ) " King Gay " . ( LAUGHING ) Peter ? Peter . I thought that was you . Are you okay ? Am I what ? I know we didn 't see eye to eye at school . Goodness knows I regret that . I wanted to say something back at the pub , but I felt so terribly ashamed by what I 'd done . Let me make it up to you , Peter . Please . Gary , you 're out of your mind ! We 've come too far . It 's fucking suicide . I know . We are going to get to The World 's End if it kills us . Where 's Pete ? PETER : I hate you ! You fucking bastard ! I hate you ! Pete ! Leave it ! Why are you doing this , Peter ? We don 't want to hurt you . Come on , mate ! It 's not worth it ! Yes , it fucking is ! ( SCREAMS ) What 's he doing ? Oh , shit . Peter ... Peter ... I must say , I 'm very disappointed in you , Peter . Hlpunchthek fucking lights out . Andy ! No , no , no , there 's too many of them . Pete . Peter . We gotta go . Gary 's right . We gotta get to The King 's Head . Exactly . What ? ( G RU NTS ) We are not going to The King 's Head . We 're done . We 're going to do what we should have done in the first place . Get The Beast and get out of here . We are fucking leaving and we are never coming back . Now , you can either come with us willingly or I 'm gonna knock you the fuck out and carry you there myself . You choose . All right . All right . Just think about what you 're saying , you know , because you have been drinking . You fuck . STEVEN : Shit , it 's those fucking kids . Not them again . What the hell is that ? I don 't know , but it 's definitely not modern art . Oh , shit , we 're trapped . Where 's The Beast ? Okay , all right . We 're here , so The Beast is in the next street . How are we gonna get to it ? We 'll have to go through . Through where ? I don 't fucking believe this . Number 10 . Come on . ( GRUNTS ) Let 's go . The back door , back door . Let 's go . Here we go . Okay , there it is . Shit . We wait for an opening , and then we leg it to The Beast . We need the keys . ANDY : Gary ? Gary , what are you doing ? Just a little toast . Gary , put the pint down , yeah ? To Oliver , Pete . And to us . You know , ' cause 10 pubs isn 't bad . It 's not , but we 're calling time . Okay - ( SIGHS ) So close . Number 10 . Okay - So close . No , no , no , no , no . Gary ! Gary ! Gary ! Let him go . He left you , man . I can 't . Andy ! Gary ! Gary ! Gary , come back ! Come back , you stupid bastard ! Gary ! Gary ! Gary ! ( GRUNTING ) Andy , look out ! ( GRUNTING ) Come on ! What the ... STEVEN : Get in . Get in . Gary , Andy , get the fuck in ! You heard him , Andy . Get the fuck in . We haven 't much time ! Andy ! Go , now ! Steven ! Go ! ( GRUNTS ) And ) ' - I want you inside me . Okay - Cheers . ( OPENS DOOR ) ( PANTING ) Ah ! You 've had enough ! This is The World 's End , man ! I know ! Stop this ! Leave me alone ! What do you care anyway ? Of course I fucking care . There 's a reason I 'm angry at you ! I know why you 're angry at me , okay ? But it 's not my fault that you crashed that car . That 's not the point . You let me down , man . You were Gary King . Gary fucking King . I would have followed you to the end . ( CHUCKLES ) I fucking have ! Then stop following me ! ( GRUNTS ) No ! It 's just one more . Let me have this . You 've got everything you want . What are you talking about ? You 've got your perfect job and your perfect house and your perfect wife . You think it 's so perfect ? She left me , Gary . She took the kids to her mum 's three weeks ago . Said I 'm not present enough . I 'm trying to win her back . And God knows I am losing . But I will continue to fight , because that is how we survive . For fuck 's sake , Gary , I just punched my wedding ring out of a robot 's tummy . Exactly ! You fight for what 's important . But what is so important about The Golden Mile ? It 's all I 've got ! Gar ) ' - ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( SCREAMS ) You need help , Gary . I got help . You know what help was ? Help was a lot of people sitting in a circle talking about how fucking awful things had got . That is not my idea of a good time . And this is ? They told me when to go to bed . Me ! Gary , mate , how can you tell when you 're drunk if you 're never sober ? I don 't wanna be sober . It never got better than that night . That was supposed to be the beginning of my life . All that promise and fucking optimism . That feeling like we could take on the whole universe . It was a big lie . Nothing happened . You don 't need to do this , Gary . Yeah , I do . AUTOMATED VOICE : Please , stand by . Please , stand by . Please , stand by . Please , stand by . Ah ! What are you doing ? No , don 't go out there . THE new : Gary King . Yeah ? Gary King of the humans . Yeah . What do you want ? We are here to enable your full potential , as we have with countless worlds across the galaxy . Oh , yeah ? How 'd you manage that , then ? We appropriate a small percentage of the population at 2,000 or so penetration points across the planet . This ensures maximum coverage . From there , we create simulants to spread our ideologies through peaceful indoctrination . Our objective is simple , to ready the population for participation in our galactic community . This method requires a small sacrifice . But the fewer replacements we make , the more successful we consider our operation . Of course , we welcome those who volunteer themselves . We can offer attractive incentives for those who willingly combine . The chance to be young again and yet retain selected memories . Isn 't that something you 'd like ? Something you 've always wanted ? ( GASPS ) Oh , my God ! I 'm so cute ! The beauty of our system is that we all win . There are no losers . Allow me to carry your legend forward . Let the man you have become be the boy you were . ( CHUCKLES ) Nah . ( GRUNT S ) There 's only one Gary King . Then you have made your choice , Gary King of the humans . Yeah , I have . Because frankly , who the fuck are you to come down here and tell us what to do ? We are The Network and we are here for your betterment . In the last 23 years , have you not marveled as information technology has surged forward ? No . Earth has grown smaller yet greater as connectivity has grown . This is our doing and it is just the beginning . Oh , fuck off , you big lamp . You are children and you require guidance . There is no room for imperfection . Hey , Earth isn 't perfect , all right ? And humans aren 't perfect . And guess what ? I ain 't perfect . And therein lies the necessity for this intervention . Must the galaxy be subjected to an entire planet of people like you ? Whoa , whoa , whoa . Who put you in charge , huh ? Who are you to criticize anyone ? Now , you might think Gary 's a bit of a cock , and he is a bit of a cock , but he 's my cock . Oh , thanks , man . But he is a detriment to himself , just as Earth is a detriment to the galaxy . What did you say ? You act out the same cycles of self-destruction again and again . At this point your planet is the least civilized in the entire galaxy . What did he say ? He 's saying we 're a bunch of fuck-ups . Hey , it 's our basic human right to be fuck-ups . This civilization was founded on fuck-ups . And you know what ? That makes me proud . And me ! What is it they say ? " To err is ... " " To err is human . " " To err is human , " so , uh ... We do not believe you speak for all humanity . You are but two men . Two drunk men . STEVEN : Three drunk men ! BOTH : Stevie-baby ! ( ALL LAUGHING ) Enough ! Enough , humans ! Oh , you are in trouble now . It 's only the fucking Three Musketeers . You are revolting against the wisdom of countless solar systems . Yeah , we are revolting ! You just said you 're not here to conquer . Can I just ask , how many people did you have to replace in Newton Haven ? That is irrelevant . ls it ? Hands up . Who here is human ? I 'm human . One ! And me . That 's two . I am . But don 't know for how long . ALL : Basil ! Shh ... So what 's that ? Three ? You had to replace an entire town ? Not the entire town . Everybody apart from old Nutbowl and the Shifty twins . That 's a good name for a band , Gary . You should write that down . I will . What about the ones you replaced , like Peter and Oliver ? Yeah , what happened to the empties ? BASIL : I told you not to ask that ! Redundant vessels are recycled , mulched and converted into fertilizer , whereupon they are returned to the earth to promote verdancy and growth . It is a highly efficient means of organic renewal . Mulched ? It is a relative few in light of our long-term plan . You mean a few hundred thousand turned to fucking compost ? What about the other places ? The penetration points . ( WHISTLES ) ( BOTH GIGGLE ) Are they as successful as Newton Haven ? Because I 'm guessing we 're not the only glitch in your system . It is true , The Network has been experiencing some difficulties . I think you bit off more than you can chew with Earth , mate . Yeah , ' cause we are more belligerent , more stubborn and more idiotic than you can possibly imagine , and I am not just talking about Gary . Yeah , there 's more than one Gary King . But you said ... I fucking know what I fucking said ! Your reliance on profanity is a measure of your immaturity as a man and a species . Why don 't you just get in your rocket and fuck off back to Legoland , you cunts ! Yeah ! Stop fucking Starbucking us , man ! Yeah ! It is our duty to challenge you . Just leave us to our own devices , you intergalactic arseholes . You misunderstand . Shut up ! We are trying ... Nobody 's listening ! If you 'd only ... Face it , we are the human race and we don 't like being told what to do . Just what is it that you want to do ? We want to be free ! Yeah . We want to be free to do what we want to do ! Yeah . We want to get loaded . Yeah . And we want to have a good time . And that 's what we 're going to do . It is pointless arguing with you . You will be left to your own devices . Really ? Yeah . Fuck it . They fucked off . ( ALL LAUGHING ) Yeah , yeah , yeah ! Up yours ! Up yours ! Up yours ! Yeah , we did it ! We won , we won ! ( LAUGHING ) Gary , let 's Boo-Boo . Yeah , it 's shit here , innit ? Oi , up here ! Go ! Get up . Come on ! Well done . Thanks a bunch . Had to go and spoil it , didn 't you ? Yeah , happy now ? Basil , what do we do now ? Same as before . Go ! Where 's The Beast ? The Beast is dead , mate . You know what ... You know what 's really annoying ? What ? I promised myself I wouldn 't die in this town . You 're not gonna . I think our luck just changed . ( HORN HONKING ) Whoo-hoo ! Oh ! SAM : Sorry ! Sam ? Yes . You came back for us ! Yes , I did . Well , I got lost on the ring road . But , yes . Hi , Sam , could you give us a lift to London , please ? Did you find out what happened to my brother ? We 'll tell you on the way . Sorry about the mess . I 've been meaning to clear that up . We forgive you . Let 's go . Which way ? Backwards ! Which way now ? Go straight over ! ( ALL SCREAMING ) We can make it . We 're gonna make it . We made it ! ( ALL COUGHING ) ( GRUNTS ) I 'm sorry . I know . I know . ANDY : Everyone remembers where they were when the lights went out on Planet Earth . Me , Gary , Steven and Sam , we were standing right by the switch . I guess it was a big night for everyone . That morning gave a whole new meaning to the word " hangoveﬂi We decided to walk it off , all the way back to London , but the headache didn 't end there . Itjust went on and on . Talk about the Big Smoke . When The Network went down , it triggered some kind of pulse , wiped out all our technology and sent us here , back to the Dark Ages . There were casualties , of course . I knew a few of them . Some guy from work , my cousin Paul , Gary 's mum . Nobody really knew how many we lost , because we never heard from the rest of the world again . Everyone got cut off . It isn 't easy now , but it is simpler . I 'm back with the wife , which is something . We decided our problems didn 't seem as bad in the grand scheme of things . We all had to go organic in a big way , but if I 'm honest , I 'm hard pressed to recall any processed foods I actually miss . As for the blanks , well , a funny thing happened there . They woke up . A week or so after The Network pulled out , they just sort of rebooted by themselves , tried to start afresh . They seemed lost at first , children cut off from their parents , abandoned , forgotten , looking for guidance , for someone to show them the way . I felt a bit sorry for them , to be honest . The Network was right about one thing . We can be a bit uncivilized . Maybe we would 've been a bad influence on the rest of the galaxy . Oliver went back to being an estate agent . People still need a roof over their heads , and the old Ollie always had a gift for the gab . I guess the new one has , too . ( CHUCKLES ) He 's doing all right . I hear that the Peter found his way home to Bishop 's Gardens . I suppose he picked up where the other one left off . I 'm not sure his wife noticed . Maybe she chose not to . He 's a pretty good dad by all accounts . Steven and Sam got together in the end . Didn 't see that coming . They shacked up just outside London . It 's a pretty nice shack , too . As for Gary ? I don 't know what happened to Gary . We got separated and I never saw him again . Some say he went back to Newton Haven . I don 't know why . I think his business there was done . It 's funny , but I miss him . I wonder if he misses me . Misses the boys . Wherever he is , I hope he 's happy . That 's all he ever wanted , really . To have a good time . I just hope he found it beyond the bottom of a glass . Because real happiness , real friends , those are things worth living for , worth fighting for . Blank bastards . Fucking robots . Five waters , please . You can have one . But I ain 't serving this scum . Well , I 'm afraid it 's all for one and one for all . You see , my young friends and I are on an adventure . A quest , if you will . And since we find ourselves in need of refreshment , you , sir , have the honor of drawing first blood . So , I 'll ask you again , for the last time , five waters , please . Who the hell do you think you are ? Me ? They call me The King . ( SCREAMS ) ( UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING )

 There are over 6 billion people on planet Earth , ordinary folks like you and me . But if you look around carefully , you might find that some of these ordinary folks have extraordinary abilities . I call them Alphas . You 're not alone , Cameron . Everyone on this unit is just like you . They are all Alphas . I hear something . Footsteps running . Three men in pursuit . Take this ticket and eat it . When I first discovered the Alpha phenomenon , I was a doctor treating a group of remarkable patients , including my daughter Dani . People fear what they do not understand or what they cannot control . The government 's solution to the problem is Binghamton , a clandestine prison hospital where Alphas are confined and subjected to experiments without any respect paid to their civil rights or their humanity . By our keeping the Alpha phenomenon secret , we are following a path which I believe can only lead to violence ... a conflict against a rogue group of Alphas organized by their leader , Stanton Parish . War . It 's inevitable . Nothing that you or I can do to stop that . You 'll forgive me if I try . I am calling for transparency . An end to secrets . Alphas exist . They are among us . They are our friends and our spouses . This is what we have been hiding ... - I warned you . - Security ! Get him out of here . The secret that Stanton Parish so badly wants concealed . And by sharing this truth , it will become evident that it 's time for everyone to open their eyes , to open their minds , and to open- - I see you 've been picking your cuticles again . I suspect it 's this place . Being here , day in and day out , must be incredibly stressful for you . I find yoga and meditation particularly efficacious in an environment like this . What about the drugs ? Do they help ? You should try some and see for yourself . I 'm not psychologically unstable . Natalie , you are deflecting again . Why are we here , Dr. Rosen ? I could ask you the same question . I 'm here because the government wants me out of the way . Shelved . For exposing the Alphas phenomenon . Delusions of persecution . Classic symptom of paranoia . I am not delusional . Though I am being persecuted . Lee , you know how this goes . You can deny your issues , or you can commit to therapy and maybe I can help . Oh , please . We both know my fate has nothing to do with these sessions . Hour 's up . Talked to my boy , Doc . You were right , it was the stuff with the dog . Well , I 'm glad I could help . Children mourn differently than we do , remember that . Be patient and encourage him to express himself . We 're working on it . That 's your stop . Yes , indeed it is . Lemme get that for you . You okay , Doc ? No , William . I 'm not okay . I 've been here eight months . Eight wasted months . I have important things to do . Patients , clients . I need to get out of here . Sorry , Doc . Wish I could help . ? ? Alphas ? Do you seriously believe in that crap ? World is filled with surprises . How much longer we gotta be here ? You in a rush ? Trying to get home to watch Storage Wars ? Tip said sometime today . Well , this muzak is killing me . I 'm tired of reading deodorant labels . You could always switch to hemorrhoid cream . Douchebag . That would be aisle three , Hicks . Yeah . ? ? It 's on ! Cover the exits ! Back corner ! She 's an Alpha ! She tapped into the cables ! Pull her loose ! Everybody down ! This is a robbery ! Surprise . You 're not the only one . Drop it ! I said drop it ! ? There 's always sweet and sour ? ? so we are not ? Hicks , cover your ears ! Let 's go ! - Meg , we 're leaving ! - Uhh ! Hicks ! Get the rest . Hey , Hicks ! Get ' em . Take ' em down ! We got two males headed west on 43rd , silver pick-up , no rear plate . ? Alphas 2x01 ? Wake Up Call Original Air Date on July 23 , 2012 ? Don 't say no ? ? for an answer ? ? and there 's no telling ? ? where we 've been ? = = sync , corrected by elderman = = ? ' Cause people don 't understand ? ? understand , understand ? ? people don 't understand ? ? people like me ? Harken . Yo , Harken . What 's up , Hicks ? I can 't spell worth a crap . What is it , " u " before " e " except after ... You kidding me ? You know there 's a spell-check on that thing ? What , your adrenals kickin your ass ? You 're kinda looking a little pasty there . I mean , for you . Don 't hate . Appreciate . Okay ? Besides , which one of us actually caught someone and which one of us shot and killed a parking meter ? Friggin ' meter had it coming . Sorry , I kinda screwed the pooch . Don 't blame yourself . You want to blame somebody , you blame Cley . Some damn intel , please ? Is that too much to ask , ya know ? " Hey , freaks , F.Y.I. , you might want to bring some earplugs . " Besides , we still bagged one out of three , which is more than I can say for Cley and his boys . Just take it easy on Cley , man . I mean , he 's a Pittsburgh Pirates fan . He suffers enough . That 's a self-inflicted wound . Dude is still in there . He couldn 't get a Girl Scout to confess her favorite cookie . That 's Megan Bates . So look , " neuro-diversity . " What is that , " e-u " ? " U-e " ? You have been logging into that chat room , haven 't you ? Helping Alphas , right ? That 's part of our job ? I 'm tellin ' you , there 's a lotta people in that chat room , they got questions . That chat room is filled with pimply-faced teenagers pretending to be Alphas . You 're probably the only real Alpha on there . Maybe . Gary goes on there sometimes . - Really ? - Mm . Has he logged in lately ? His mother left a voicemail yesterday , saying , uh ... he stopped calling . Nothing for two weeks . No , I haven 't heard from him . Shoulda never let Cley assign Gary to the N.S.A. Yeah , well , it 's not like we had a choice . Look , I 'll rattle their cage , remind them to let him call home . C 'mon , what are you doing ? No , no coffee . What are ya doing ? C 'mon . Look . You drop dead of a heart attack , I 'm on my own . We 're a team . Look , I hate to break it to you , but without Rosen , there is no team . Rachel . Daddy ... so loud . It 's a beautiful day . You haven 't left the house in months . You quit your job , you move back home , fine . But hiding in your room ? Jumping at every sound ? Rachel , don 't tune me out . Please , Baba , I 'm just tired , okay ? - I found you a new therapist . - No . Rachel , he can help . Baba , there 's only one person that I 've ever trusted , and he 's gone , so please ... okay ? I just want to rest . Have a wonderful day now ... and that 's an order . They say there 's no such thing as Alphas ! But I know ! Alphas control the world ! They 're everywhere ! Alphas control the world ! They--they put thoughts into my head ! Terrible thoughts , beamed into my brain- - You ! You need to stop talking . We don 't use beams . Taxi ! Taxi ! Excuse me . Let 's share a cab . It 's the wife . Phone doesn 't work inside . I 'll catch up . Hicks , what are you doing ? You 're not supposed to take that off . Just letting her have some fresh air . This is Binghamton . No , not just Binghamton . Nice girl like you gets the upgrade . Building Seven ? You think I 'm scared ? Go to hell , traitors . Hicks , that 's why you 're not supposed to take that mask off . Thank you , gentlemen . Please wait here while I get her transfer papers . I hate this place . Well , it 's part of the job . Just hold your nose , and think about that government dental plan . Jamming pacifier chips in the back of people 's necks ? It 's not the job . It 's Night of the Living Dead . What else we gonna do ? These people are violent . And they have abilities . Lethal abilities . So at least this is humane . Humane ? What , like the S.P.C.A. ? Alphas are rabid dogs now , is that it ? Megan Bates and her crew pulled off 15 armed robberies , left five people dead . Now she definitely belongs down here . All of these people who are down here- - Gary ? It is Gary ! Gary ! Guard ! This is from the National Security Agency in Arlington ten days ago . And you just found out about this ? N.S.A. won 't tell you what color the sky is without formal approval . We warned you about this when you sent him over there . Gary 's autistic . He 's got needs . He doesn 't like to be touched . Gary 's got a set routine , specific food , and needs someone to listen to him talk about cars . I told ' em . You think they care ? He sent two of their agents to the hospital , they sent him here- - end of story . Hey , Dad ? Ah , Dani , hi . You 're early today . Yeah , yeah , I am . You okay ? Yeah . Yeah , it 's just this ... the level of sedation is just completely gratuitous . Yeah . Let me help . Oh , thank you . Yeah , that 's a little bit better . I think your visits are the only thing keeping me sane . So , how 's everything in your big bad world ? Um ... Dad , according to your lawyers , the government is making you look pretty bad . They brought up the LSD bust , everything that mom said in the divorce papers . Well , I worry them something fierce . They 'll do whatever it takes to discredit me . Well , Dad , they 're calling it a history of mental illness . I don 't know if they 're ever gonna let you out of here . No , Dani , they are going to . And soon , I think . How can you be so sure ? Because try as they might , Dani , the government cannot cover up everything . Plus ... there 's Stanton Parish . Hmm ? Out there somewhere , planning God knows what . Sooner or later , there will be an event- - or a series of events- - they simply cannot control without me . So that 's what I 'm waiting for . An event . Okay , Miss Bates . You 'll feel a little pinch . And running final diagnostic . Why don 't you just turn the chip off for ten minutes , okay ? So we can find out what happened to our friend . There 's nothing that I can do . I understand , sir , but it is our belief that Mr. Bell was simply mishandled . He is a valuable asset . They shouldn 't have stuck a chip in his brain ! Yeah , not helping . I 'm activating her chip now . Whoa ! Some kind of power surge ? Cut the breakers ! Cut the breakers ! Aah ! It 's Meg . When they chipped her , they let her in the whole damn system . They 'll all wake up . What is that ? What the hell is going on ? Power loss . Get the guards in . Lock these doors , down . Both sides ! Code 12-28 in building seven . Code 12-28 in building seven . N-no . - Gary . - No . - Gary . Gary , it 's me , Bill . - No , no , no . - Keep that closed ! - Gary , it 's me , Bill . Gary , listen . No . No . No . - Gary , come on . Get up , get up . - No . No . No ! No ! No ! We got a situation here ! We need backup ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Aah ! Go ! Gary- - Agent Harken . I remember you . You 've got a weak heart . I can stop that . Ah , Gary ... This is bad . We gotta get out of here . You see signals ? Gary , I don 't think I can amp up . So please tell me you see a way out . Come on , partner . Look ... Okay , partner , I 'm gonna need you . Okay ? It 's time to step your game up . Step- - step your game up . Right ? Gary . Cornell . Baby . I shorted out everything , but the fail-safe doors dropped . Let me in there . I can make a difference . Unless your ability misfires again . Someone turn off that damn alarm ! Testing . Testing . One , two . Testing , mic check . Sibilance . Sibilance . Hello-o . Cornell Scipio . Hello , Cornell . This is a formal negotiation , Agent Cley . You call me Mr. Scipio . We 're not negotiating . Release the hostages , or things get worse . Worse than having a chip in my neck ? All right . Wanna play hardball ? Asher . Please . I have a family . I got a family too . Don 't shoot . We can still talk about this . I 'm not gonna shoot him . Kimi ? My God , that 's Kimi Milard . Next time . Okay , we get the message . Mr. Scipio , what are your demands ? You know what , I 'm actually done talking with you , Cley . There 's only one person I 'm willing to negotiate with . Doc , there 's been an incident . I 'll fill you in on the ride . No , Nathan . That 's not the way it 's going to work . You fill me in first , and then , if I decide to help , then we take that ride . Rachel . Rachel ? Hi . Dr. Rosen . I never thought I 'd see you again . I know . But I 'm here now , and it 's because I need you . Which means you have to leave this room . Now , you 've been here before . You know what you have to do . Focus on the things that comfort you , tune everything else out , and take a step forward . So I 'm thinking for dinner , there 's this little Sushi place on Broadway . You like Sushi , right ? What am I doing here ? I 'm supposed to be at work . No . Right now , You 're supposed to be here with me . So kiss me . Okay ? Tell me I 'm beautiful . Oh , you 're beautiful . Nina . Go home . What do you want ? Because I have things to do . Nina , Gary 's in trouble . He needs us . Gary , I should have never let Cley loan you out to the N.S.A. I know that now . I just thought I needed to do whatever it took to show that we were still valuable without Rosen . And I overstepped . Gary , I 'm trying to apologize right now . Do you hear me ? Gary , do you hear- - Gary ! That was--that was too loud . Right . That was--that was dumb . I just ... Gary , I 'm sorry . - He 's here . - What- - - Hey , Rache . - Hicks . So you came . I 'm here for Gary , not you . Right . What happened between the two of you ? - I woke up . - Yeah ? Is that what you call pushing everyone you meet ? You need help . You feel like jumping off a building ? - Nina . - Please , both of you . You can discuss how much you care about each other later . Right now , there are things I need each of you to do while I 'm out of contact . Out of contact ? Yes . If I 'm going to work with the people inside , I need to be inside . Doc , you know , you ... put a lot of these guys in there . Now , what if all they wanna do is get their hands on you , huh ? Well , if that 's the case , this will all be over shortly . I 'll do what I can in there , and I 'll relay what I discover to the three of you , via Rachel . But if for some reason I can 't defuse the situation , then , Cameron ... Right . We play cavalry . Yes . At the right moment . And only if absolutely necessary . Clear . Rachel ? I 'm in . I don 't see anyone so far . If I bump into any invisible Alphas , I 'll let you know . It 's deserted , but I hear footsteps . I 'm here to talk . I 'm not . Hello , Ted . You asked me a lot of questions before you threw me in here . How I see weak spots , what they look like to me . Still curious ? Oh ... ah ... That 's your radial nerve . Touchy , isn 't it ? I see Building Seven hasn 't diminished your abilities any . Asher ! This man is our guest . I 'm sorry about that . Dr. Rosen ? Cornell Scipio . I 'm a big fan . Welcome to the monkey house . Hey , Dr. Rosen 's asking to see Bill and Gary . Scipio 's not going for it . There 's a banging ... it 's faint , but it 's regular . Scipio 's voice just got angrier . He wants to know how Dr. Rosen can justify putting them in there . How they 've been treated . We are still in building seven . We are rotting . Yes , I understand your frustration . You all are being treated deplorably . And ... I want to change that . That 's one of the main reasons I went public with the Alphas situation in the first place . That 's why I am here . I-I wa--I want to help . You wanna help . Okay ... tell me--tell us why we 're so screwed up . You are not screwed up . If anything , you are all extremely gifted . C 'mon . I set things on fire . I make people 's skin sizzle . Let 's face it , they 're never gonna let us out of here . I 'm a mistake . We are all mistakes . Maybe we all belong in a cage . And here comes the line about how there are no mistakes . We 're all just people . Kumbaya . No . Actually Dr. Rosen isn 't giving him any sympathy at all . Your ability isn 't the mistake . The mistake is how you- - you choose to use it . Yes . That 's what I wanted to talk to you about . What in my brain makes me different ? Can--hey- - can I turn it off ? You really want to talk about this right now . Yeah . Can 't hear a damn thing . I get up at 7 : 42 . What 'd you say ? Get up- - I get up at 7 : 42 . Brush my teeth . Dress myself appropriately in shirt and pants . Right . You have to wear pants , even if they 're uncomfortable . It 's important to wear pants when you leave the house . Right . It 's important to wear pants , and it 's important to interact with people . Right , Gary ? I get up at 7 : 42 . Brush my teeth . And I dress myself- - Gary . No , Gary . Whenever you are stressed or you feel threatened your sweat glands produce two chemicals that when combined combust . Oh , so I 'm combustible . That 's ... cute . But , uh , actually , at the moment you seem quite calm , despite your condition . Which strikes me as , um ... a bit odd , given the situation we 're in right now . Is this a delaying tactic , Mr. Scipio ? No , no , no , no , no , my questions matter . 'Cause if I 'm a mistake and I can 't change that , where does that end ? A mistake isn 't human , a mistake is ... something else . A " them " . Us versus them . And I don 't get to choose whose side I 'm on . That , uh ... sounds like something coming from Stanton Parish . Stanton Parish , where 's that ? Somewhere near Baton Rouge ? Baby ? We 're ready . Ready for what ? What 's going on ? I was right . Th-this has all been a ruse . Listen to me , Cornell . There is no " us " or " them " . You are not a mistake . Thinking that way is the mistake , and- - and you can prove it to yourself , you can prove your humanity . Just let these hostages go , and I promise- - You know what , Rosen , I 've enjoyed our little chat , but , um ... It 's time for the main event . Where 's he taking him ? Whoa , whoa , what happened ? Get up at 7 : 42- - All right , you two , it 's time . We need eyes . I gotta get inside . Hey - Cley , go now ! - Go , go , go ! Move ! Move ! Time 's up . What 're they doing ? No ... Oh , my God . Somebody 's gotta stop him . Hicks , they just shot a guard . Oh , my God . No , no , no , no . Y-you- - you can 't do this . I can do all sorts of things . Go , go , go ! Oh , my God . I can 't think ! We need , uh- - we need an ambulance , we need a- - a pararamedics ! It 's wrong . It 's all wrong . I 'm clear . What are you talking about ? I don 't smell the burning . Okay ? The yelling , the screaming , it 's- - it 's only on the monitors . - You okay ? - I 'm okay . Hicks ! Hicks , can you hear me ? It 's all fake . Fake . Rachel 's saying it 's all fake . Hicks , I 'm hearing something upstairs . Come on , this way ! Move , move , move ! Let 's go ! She 's hacked into the security feed . Maybe she faked the whole thing . She painted pictures with the ones and zeros to lure us in here . Where 'd they go ? Too late . You lose . Hicks . I 'm still hearing the banging . Ted Asher , he , uh- - he finds the weak spots , right ? Rachel , where is that banging coming from ? It 's the southeast corner . He was punching his way out . Come on , move ! It 's not gonna do you any good if you- - Just be quiet ! Not you . You 're not one of us . I can 't--oh , my God- - Rachel , Rachel , no , Rachel , look at me . Okay ? Nina ... You 're not scared . You are completely focused . Cornell , let Bill and Gary go . You don 't need them . You don 't need hostages anymore . You 've proved your humanity already ! I 'm not human . I 'm an Alpha . Please don 't do this ! Doc ! Doc ! Cameron ! They 've taken Bill and Gary . We 've got to stop them , Cameron . Which one ? Get up at 7 : 42 . I get up at 7 : 42 . I swear to God , shut him up . He doesn 't shut up in the back of the car . Second from the front . They 're in the backseat . Take the shot , Hicks . Cameron , it 's just like throwing a quarter . Just like throwing a quarter . God . No ... No ! Bill ! Gary ! Gary . Thank God . Lie down . Lie down . Lie down . I got you . Bill , deep breaths . Deep breaths , Bill . Good job , bill . Good shot , Hicks . Asher 's out cold . Where 's Scipio ? Rachel ? He 's gone . Let 's face it , Nathan , you can 't control the Alphas situation . You haven 't found Parish yet , and you , or whomever else is in charge , can 't cover this up forever . For the past eight months you 've been fighting a losing battle . Look , what happened in Building Seven , it was bad . But those hostages came out alive . You and your team made that happen . Yeah , we did what we could . Listen . Why don 't you just tell me what you want to tell me ? We need you . We need you to pull your team back together , and deal with the Building Seven escapees , and keep a lid on this entire mess . Well , why didn 't the government think of that before they institutionalized me ? The government is 100,000 feudal kingdoms all fighting for money and control . Sure , you got some enemies in D.C. , but you got some friends , too . And what are these friends offering me ? A full pardon . A cause . And a fat consulting fee . It 'll be just like the old days . Ah , you know , there 's a reason they call them the old days , is because they are old . Lee , I got you a sweet deal here . Take it . Or you 'll end up back in your rubber room . All right , so , if uh , you or whomever wants me back , I need to run the program . I decide what happens to the Alphas we locate . I approve of the assignments , and with no interference . Or I 'm out . Hey , Gary . My mom 's hummus . Your favorite . Rachel , he 's not a dog , okay ? He doesn 't respond to treats . Dogs don 't like hummus . Do they , Gary ? I thought you said he was talking . Yeah , he was . You know , Gary-babble , but ... after the crash , not a peep . I figured if you bring him to us- - familiar surroundings- - he 'd feel something , or- - Maybe he just needs some time , okay , just to get adjusted . Come on , Gary . Gary , c 'mon , look . Gary . C 'mon now , look around here . All right ? Look . Everybody 's here . You 're back at work . What do you do ? You greet your co-workers appropriately , right ? So , come on . Come on , greet me . Come on , you bastard , greet me . Look , I 'll let you drive- - no . You 're--you 're on the right track . Still , um ... may I ? He 's all yours . Uh , Gary ? I , uh , understand why you 're not , uh , greeting everyone . Uh , greetings usually happen at 9 : 00 a.m. Uh , so , now it is , uh , 3 : 14 . Now , we 're not on a case . What do you usually do around 3 : 14 ? Okay , this is hopeless . He 's exactly the same way as he was when we first met him . Don 't say that . Wait , wait wait , wait . He just- - he just looked at me . You see that ? Gary , let 's imagine today . All right ? You , uh ... You got up at 7 : 42 . You brushed your teeth , as- - as usual , and then you- - you got dressed , you know ? Shirt , socks , shoes , pants , right ? Right . You gotta wear pants , because that 's important , right ? Mmhmm . And then you , uh , went downstairs , you got breakfast , and then you came in . And you greeted everyone . Um ... And then you worked , uh , you had lunch , and now it is , uh- - well , you 've been here all day . So , what do you normally do then ? She 's worried about you , Gary . She hasn 't heard from you . What are you going to do ? This is Sandra Bell . Leave a message . No , it 's the voicemail . - I 'll call you back . - I hate the voicemail . Mom ! I 'm at the office , and I 'm fine . I don 't have a chip in my head anymore . Okay , bye . - Gary- - - I--no , don 't do that . I know , I know . I didn 't mean to . I- - - My personal space . - I know , I know- - Too bad , ' cause here comes another one . - No , Bill , get off me ! - There you go . C 'mon ! You called me a bastard . That 's not nice . You tell ' em , Gary . Yeah , uh- - Bill , you know what ? You 're the bastard . You 're right . You left me with N.S.A. And they made me spy on my friends . And then--and then , they wouldn 't answer when I greeted them appropriately . And they put me in Building Seven , Bill . And you just left me there . I 'm - You all left me there . Yes , Gary , uh- - that 's right . W-w--I did . And , uh , that was a mistake . Yeah ! Mistake . But , now , we are going to make them right . All of us . Together . We , uh ... We stored a few things in your office while you were gone . I 'm--I 'm gonna help you get ' em out . All right ? Okay . Thanks . Wait . Hicks , why are you- - what kinds of things ? Smelly things ? Hicks ? I 'm glad to have you back . Yeah . No , don 't do that . I don 't like that . Too bad . Stanton . It 's a little dramatic , don 't you think ? Holding a meeting in the wasteland ? Hmm . Sentimental , actually . Marched through here during the war . It was orchards then . All the way to the river . Now it 's a pit . Yeah , people really do screw everything up , don 't they ? The smokestack has ever waged war on the apple tree . We 'll put an end to that . Better people , better world . How 's your father ? He 's free . Like you said . I just got the call . Good . Such injustice , him rotting away in there . I 'm glad that he can benefit from our efforts . Still ... miles to go before we sleep . Let 's get to work . = = sync , corrected by elderman = =

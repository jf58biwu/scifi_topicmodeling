 I think someone 's got to say it . We are surrounded by people who should have died . And by persisting they are draining the resources of healthy living citizens . They 're calling them Overflow Camps . But what the hell are they up to ? Whatever it is , I bet it ain 't good . And I can understand your pain , all of you . I understand it because I have suffered the same as you . Is Oswald Danes now becoming the one true representative of this miracle age ? They 're building these sort of camps - to help people . - Overflow Camps ? Aye , that 's it . And I got your dad inside the South wales site . Just- - just get him back ! Gwen , it 's too late . Excuse me . I 'm on the medical panels . Where is everybody ? Oh , you didn 't get the email ? Sorry , those are done . Those are done ? How , how are they done ? The report was sent to Congress today . The H.H.S. Secretary took it directly to the President . Now that categories have been finalized it clears the way for a lot of legislation . Categories ? What categories ? - The categories of life . - What does that mean ? Instead of dead or alive there are now three categories . Here . It 's being rolled out across America and Europe . The categories become official at midnight . Dr. Juarez , I was right . I knew you 'd call me back . Oh , I 'm doing a lot more than that . I 'm joining the cause . Whatever you 're doing to fight this miracle , count me in . They just took control of life and death . - ♪ Torchwood : Miracle Day 4x05 ♪ The Categories of Life Original Air Date on August 5 , 2011 = = sync , corrected by elderman = = And today the United Nations has officially sanctioned the new category system with immediate effect , calling this a radical new start for the health of humanity . The President said today that categorization is compulsory . Under the emergency miracle law anyone designated as Category 1 or Category 2 must be taken to the new Overflow Camps . The scheme is already underway in the United Kingdom with the Prime Minister declaring this a new age of care and compassion . Thank you . - Yvonne Pallister . - Yes indeed , madam . I 'm your driver clearly . Might I ask , is there any luggage to pick up ? No , the only thing you 'll be picking up is me . That 'll be a pleasure . I don 't think I like the tone of your voice . - And what are you gonna do about it ? - Many things . Mwah . Come on , let 's get out of here . Who 's with Anwen ? No one . I left her with petrol and a cigarette lighter . - Your mom 's there , isn 't she ? - Oh great . See , now in America you can legally divorce your own mother . Oh , that 's it , I get it . They do things better in America , don 't they ? Not everything , Mr. Sloane . Well , hello there . Look at you . Look at you . Have you been good ? Have you missed your mom ? Oh , look at how you 've grown so much . Now have I got a kiss ? She 's a very good girl . Sleeps the whole night . Doesn 't fuss at bedtime like some babies I could mention . Look what you 're wearing , huh ? So much pink . So cute . - What 's all this ? - Your latest mission . For God 's sake , Mary , I told you let her get in . Let her sit down and spend some time with her own daughter . She doesn 't need to start work straightaway . Isn 't that right , Gwen ? - This is all off the A48 ? - Two miles outside Cowbridge . It 's taking in patients from the whole of South wales . It looks like old army barracks . Closed down in 1996 . Reopened two days ago . Designated an official Overflow Camp . That 's where they 've taken your father . And that 's where you 're going to get him out . If you 're here about an existing claim , - step to the right , please . - But my son is in here . They took him and no one asked me . Can I see him please ? - He 's only 17 . - I 've written , I 've phoned . I 've been standing over there for two hours and I was in the wrong place . - I 've got money . 5,000 in cash . - No no no . Can I remind you all any cars parked by the gates of the module will be towed , no excuses ? - Bloody hellfire . - What 's the size of this place ? God knows . They 've got patients coming in from Bristol too . Hospitals are closing across the southwest ' cause M.R.S.A. is going crazy . Add to that the increase in geriatrics and maternity , the N.H.S. is gonna go bust by the end of the week . - How many camps nationwide ? - 35 so far . I mean fair do 's , it might be chaos , but at least it works . - Andy , don 't be so thick . - It 's nice to have you back . Well , think about it . No N.H.S. , who 's paying for all this ? Phicorp . You 've got health care being run by private business . And believe me , that 's just the start of your problems . Now listen , one at a time . - He 's Category 2 . - I 'm first , my mother 's Category 1 . I need to take my father home . - You need to get in the queue . - You need to back off . - His name is Geraint Wyn Cooper . - No one 's going out today . Right , forget you . Who 's in charge ? Who 's in charge ? Admin is over there . Complaint forms are on the desk in yellow . - Right . - But we 've been waiting over there . Excuse me . Excuse me , Lieutenant . This won 't take long . I need to move a patient . It 's urgent . Then you really need to speak to one of the care workers over there . They can tell you how to process your claim . It 's not a claim . I haven 't bumped my car . We 're talking about my father . Sorry , if I could just- - the thing is , the removal of this woman 's father is being done under police authority , sir . Thank you , but we are not under the control of the Welsh Police , Sergeant . Look , his name is Geraint Wyn Cooper . He 's had a heart attack but he 's recovering . So he sounds like a Category 2 , which means he 'll be perfectly safe in here . If you 'd care to read the definitions ... Oh , I like that . Yeah , I 'll show you definitions . Just have a look at this . Bloody Phicorp logo . Now listen to me . This country is not under martial law . My father is a taxpayer and a law-abiding citizen . He is entitled to go home and I am not moving until I take him . Have you got that ? Yes , that 's perfectly clear . And I hope it 's also clear why I 'm now having you arrested . Whoa whoa whoa . Hey , sorry , boys . - Come on now , Gwen . I think we 're leaving . - Not going anywhere . Given time , we will have this facility open and happy and running like clockwork with access for all . But right now we have cholera and dysentery and swine flu . And every single patient needs immediate definition under the three categories . So it 's a lockdown . No one is allowed in and no one is allowed out . When the situation changes we 'll let you know . Thank you . Excuse me , please . Excuse me . Bloody categories . All the things I fought with Torchwood and what stops me ? - Red tape . - We 'll find another way , Gwen . Yes , and I 'll tell you what it is . We 're gonna break in here . We 're gonna find my father and we 're gonna get him out tonight . - Do you think I 'm useless ? - No . I think you 're new to all this . - Yeah , but I 'm C.I.A. - So is Rex . But he 's just pretending . And that 's the big secret , Esther . Times like these the game goes to the person who speaks with the loudest voice . But pretty much everyone just wishes their mother was here . I lost my mom back in 2003 . What about you ? I don 't know . Long ago and so far away . Jack . Where are you from ? - Rex . - Rex . - Hmm . - The loudest voice . That 's him . Got to go . World to save , useless Esther . Vera , this is Jack Harkness . We keep meeting . It 's like Destiny . Yeah , he likes to call himself Captain Jack , but I 'm not buying that . And Esther you 've already met when I got injured . - Dr. Juarez , hello again . - You can call me Vera . I was lucky to get a flight . Everyone 's coming to L.A. for this event tonight . The miracle rally . The plane was full and the A.C. was bust . I could use a shower . - We 're a bit short of room . - That 's okay . But I suppose you two ... I mean , you 're gonna share . Or is that none of my business ? I mean , you 're both- didn 't you ? - I 'll sleep on the floor . Yeah , thanks for nothing . Sorry , my mistake . Or are you not buying that too ? Let me make one thing clear . I didn 't travel across the country for you . I came here to work . My patients are being held behind a barbed-wire fence which means I need to get this miracle resolved . And that 's all I need from you . Understood ? This is my room . I know . And Torchwood is go . This is everything we 've gathered so far . And we 've got chases updating every 20 seconds , tapping into major newsfeeds , WikiLeaks , backdoor routes into the C.I.A. and F.B.I. What about South Wales ? Yeah , I 'm here . Can you see me ? Clear as daylight , Agent Cooper . Have you seen the latest ? France and Germany have all started Overflow Camps . The whole of Europe is joining in . China 's saying no to the camps and the Pan-African Summit said yes . You 're researching morphic fields . Yeah , that 's Jack 's favorite subject . It kept getting mentioned on the medical panels . But it 's only theory . That 's Jilly Kitzinger . Are you following her ? No , we 're following Oswald Danes , but she never leaves his side . He 's connected to the top , even if he doesn 't know it yet . So this name , Torchwood . You 're like investigators ? More like freedom fighters . That makes you sound like terrorists . Look , Torchwood 's gone , okay ? It 's just a name these days . Just kind of works as a codeword to connect us , that 's all . So am I Torchwood now ? Welcome aboard . Not sure if that 's good or bad . Okay , let 's figure out how these categories work . - Esther . - Uh , yeah . Uh ... Well , they 've activated the categories over here . It 's officialdom gone mad . So listen , Category 1 is bad , yes ? Yeah , that 's people with no brain function or anyone who would normally have died . They 're now officially Category 1 . - Ordinary people are category 3 . - Vera : Right . That 's people with no injuries , nothing . They 're fine . Then Category 2 is everyone in-between- - people who are alive and functioning with an illness or injury that 's gonna persist but not kill . Like me . Yes , like you . Wait a minute , when I got hurt I should have died . I was Category 1 . But now I 'm healing so I 'm Category 2 . So which one am I ? That 's the point . People don 't fit categories . Worse than that , this process has given the United Nations a definition for life which is therefore a definition of death . The government now has the power to decide whether you 're dead or alive . No one should have that much control . Yeah , but I still don 't see it though . I mean , what does Phicorp get out of this ? How do they profit ? You think they caused the miracle ? They had advance knowledge . But they just deal in pharmaceuticals . It 's got to be bigger than that . So you 're looking for someone behind Phicorp ? Right . And whoever that is , maybe they need these Overflow Camps for a reason . 'Cause I have been looking into the NORAD satellites and the building specs . Um , sorry . I 've been overlaying documents . Look , this is our nearest Overflow Camp in San Pedro . These are the specs that we got from the Phicorp server . Spot the difference ? Look at the building on the plans called the module . But where is it on the photograph ? No module . There 's a module on the plans but not on the photos . It doesn 't exist . No , hang on . I heard somebody refer to the module today . Exactly , and that 's what I 've been wanting to show you . The module 's been masked . That 's what they do with military instillations . Right , so I went into NORAD and I got the undoctored photographs . The buildings exist . Half of these are old army camps just being converted . And now anything labeled the module is hidden from view so the public can 't see what 's going on . It 's the same for all the sites I 've checked . - The same thing in Wales too , Gwen . - Mm-hmm . So they 've taken buildings and sealed them off out of sight . What for ? Well , they 're gathering all the Category 1s . The only question is what are they using the bodies for ? Is it to investigate or to experiment ? Do you mean like dissections ? They 're dissecting people ? Vivisections . When they 're alive it 's vivisections . My father 's in there . They could be cultivating- - making diseases to make more customers using Category 1 patients like petri dishes . It could explain the rush to strip away their human rights . So we need to get inside the camp to find out what those modules are . Yeah , already on it on this end . Rhys has signed up as a driver and I used the I.D. software to get on the medical register . So nurse Yvonne Pallister is going on the night shift . San Pedro needs clerical staff . If I can get inside the office there 's bound to be paperwork on the module . - I could get inside . - What ? If I use my position on the medical panels , I could go to San Pedro as an inspector . Vera , this isn 't a game , okay ? Infiltration is specialized work and this time I 'm pulling rank . I 'm the only one that can get to the heart of this Category 1 thing . And you know why ? Because I 've got this . It 's this way . He 's over here . His name is Rex . He was injured after Miracle Day . We thought he 'd be fine but he collapsed . It 's okay , Rex . We 've got you . So what happened ? It 's the stairs , you know ? I 've got this pain in my chest that 's killing me . Where are you taking him ? We 're gonna have to take him to the overflow facility in San Pedro . - Is that okay ? - Can I come with him ? I 'm sorry , sir . There 's no visitors . Here , dial this number and ask for an update . You look after him . I love him . That crazy old boyfriend of mine . - He 's on his way . - Right , I 'm gonna follow . I phoned Washington and pulled a few strings . I 've got observer status . No no no , wait a minute . That 's why we sent Rex . I am not a member of Torchwood so you can 't give me instructions . And I need to see that place for myself . I was on the panels , Jack . I helped set these things up . Any trouble , I can help get her out . Okay , I 'm going with you . I don 't know , I could be your assistant . We told you , not a chance . That assassin said that you 're too connected . And besides , you 're too fragile , mortal man . All I get is a kiss ? You look after yourself . You 're unique . You 're category Jack . So don 't you go getting into trouble . Yes , there are some heavy hitters lined up for today 's miracle rally to raise money for the Overflow Camps . At 4 : 00 pm the vice President will introduce the President who will speak live from the Oval Office via satellite . Then a parade of big name guests will take the stage . Jessica MacCauley got here early from Redlands . Tell us who you 're here to see . Oswald Danes the execution guy . He 's just been so amazing since all this happened . But doesn 't it worry you , his criminal record ? The things he did ? But you can 't have a Miracle Day without miracles . And that 's Oswald . He really is a miracle . I think we have someone . I think we have someone here . All right , we 've got you on fourth in the running order , that 's 90 minutes before the President . They wanted clear blue water between you and him , which is understandable . Now here is a first draft of what they want you to say . Now the key word is " Revelation . " You say revelation and the Phicorp logo comes up . And I mean massive . Actually , I 've put revelation in all caps . Why has this been written ? Why was this written out for me ? - I 'd rather use my own words . - Oh really ? Oswald , that 's sweet . Take it . Oswald ! Oswald ! Get up here . Hold them back . And we 're walking , Eugene . Confirm Oswald Danes arriving at gate 6 . Oswald ! Oswald ! Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . It 's very good of you to come . Yes , it 's great to be here with all of you today . Good of all you to come . You bastard ! You bastard , Danes ! You killed her ! Go . Trouble . Go go . Go go go go . Everybody back up . Everybody back up now ! Get back right now ! Yeah , it 's gate 6 . I didn 't get the I.D. but there was a TV camera and they filmed the whole thing . Now get that footage . I want that footage destroyed . Do you hear me ? No , don 't tell me to keep it down . Don 't you ever tell me that . You just do it ! 20,000 people all here for me ? And remember , you don 't know me . Be careful out there . You 're gonna have to show your I.D. Hold on . Right here , please . Let 's go , keep moving . Pull them through . Open please . Thank you . Go ahead . I.D. All right , ma 'am . Hold on . Go ahead . Next . Okay , what have we got ? Positive on respirations . - Positive on pulse . - Shit , I could have told you that . Sorry , procedure . That makes you Category 2 , sir . - And what 's that for ? - Category 2 , rhymes with blue . Negative . Negative . Category 1 . Okay , go ahead and write up the chart and I 'll peg her . Wait a minute . What kind of system is that ? This woman is really sick . She needs more than just a peg . This is standard emergency procedure and I have 50 patients to process an hour . You got a better system , you can write me a letter , okay ? What happened to Rosanna ? I don 't know . They called me in from central office . - My name 's Esther . - Rachel . Sorry , I don 't know my way around the system yet . They told me to copy the stats for the module . Nothing to do with me . Ask Maloney . Welcome welcome . My casa is your casa . My name is Colin Maloney and I 'm in charge here . - Vera juarez . - Welcome to Medical Lot 338 , Vera . Sorry about the heat . Suppose you take it better than me , huh ? It 's fine . - Let 's get started . - Yes . Uh , is the doctor on his way ? I 'm Doctor Vera Juarez . Oh oh . I 'm- - I thought you were- - Anywho , I 'm not disappointed . I must have done something very good that they sent me such a beautiful woman . I 'd like to start with the module . I 'm sorry , module 's closed , obviously . You 're from Washington . You should know that . I know my inspection orders mention it specifically . Wow , a little dynamo , aren 't you ? Ja wohl . Anyway , patients first , I think . Don 't you ? That 's always my motto . Rachel , pull my cart around for me , would you , honey ? I had a little cart customized . I think you 'll find it easier on your feet . Look at you . You 're thin as a twig . Bet you 'd snap easily . I 'm getting there , yeah . It 's Rhys Williams and Nurse Pallister . Just like the old days . No it 's not . It 's worse . It only ever gets worse . Mr. Williams , Miss Pallister . You can head on in . - Good luck . - Okay , see you later . - You okay ? - Yeah . Sure took you long enough . - It 's busy out there . - Yeah . You friend Vera is keeping the boss distracted . What ? I told her to stay out of this . Yeah well , guess what , Rex ? Not everyone listens to you . All right , now quickly , this makes you dead . - All right . - I hate this . Don 't go getting sentimental on me . Did you bring the camera ? All right , great . Now you need to categorize me . Get me that red peg . Go ahead , it 's right there . Red peg . Put it right there . All right , here . Here , keep that in case you need to change categories . Category 1 , there 's no coming back . Don 't say that . You 're gonna be fine . Just find out what 's inside the module . - See you outside . - All right . Excuse me . Hello . Hi . - Excuse me . - This man 's in the wrong place . His chart says that he 's Category 1 . I double-checked with the office . He 's not supposed to be here so we need to get him moved . Take him to the module , okay ? Okay , found you this . Huh ? And here 's a new copy of the speech . They 've added some stuff in about a lifetime of penitence , et cetera . I understood that I was supposed to have a dressing room . - Did they run out ? - Oh no . No . There 's plenty of dressing rooms . Actually I just checked . You 'd be surprised- - genuinely chic . I 'd imagined this place to be all concrete . Where 's mine ? Tiny little problem . Certain other people in certain other dressing rooms , they don 't want you anywhere near them . And we 're talking serious names here . It 's a very definite ixnay on the oswaldway . But that 's your job . You represent me . You get me a room . Now don 't get angry . Careful with the bloodlust . It 's showing . Excuse me- - Steve , no . No , I told him no . And you know what ? If that little bastard tries to charge me one more time , so help me God , I 'm gonna get Ioannidis on him . Won 't be but a minute . No no , stay here . That 's an order . Take him to the module . I want you to meet Ralph . He 's my personal escort while I 'm on the lot . Great guy . Great guy . - Ralph : Good to meet you , Doctor . - You too , Ralph . This is my first tour , but I think we might get some important people - wanting to visit , you know ? - Mm-hmm . We 've got a line on Hilary I 'm feeling really good about . Hillary Clinton ? Duff . Hilary Duff . All right , this way . Pearls before swine . ... To help their system and to fund research into the miracle itself . Oh , we 're missing it , that miracle rally . I hear rumors of Phil Collins . This patient is being monitored every hour . - That 's very good . - Yes , our priority is efficiency . If a patient is in decline , we monitor them very closely so that we can move them to Category 1 promptly without wasting any more resources . Your priority is not efficiency . Your priority is care . Everybody gets sufficient care , Miss Juarez . Did I say any different ? Category 1 is the same as dead . You 're not just downgrading someone 's status . If you move them from Cat 2 to Cat 1 you 're letting them die . Well , there are new triage regulations , Doctor . Treat the ones who can recover . Yes , and I started those for emergency situations only . Well , this is an emergency . Everything here is an emergency . We can 't give everybody private rooms . Would you like a private room , George ? Yeah ? See , they 'd all love private rooms . But it 's impossible . Now you should see the kitchens . They are gleaming . Gwen ? Oh my God , Dad . I thought that was you . How are you ? How do you feel ? - All the better for seeing you . - Oh , Dad . What are you wearing ? Pajamas ? No , Dad . You look good though . It 's good to see you . We couldn 't come to visit . They wouldn 't let us in . So that 's why I 've come to get you , all right ? - Get me ? - Yeah . - Oh , Rhys is here . - Hiya , Geraint , all right ? - I 've got the lorry . Ready to go . - Let 's go , Dad . What have you got , shoes or just slippers ? - Where are we going ? - It 's not safe here , Dad , okay ? - I 'm gonna take you home . - What do you mean it 's not safe ? You know all those things I used to investigate with Torchwood ? This is one of them . Haven 't the time to explain now . But listen , you 've got to come with me , Dad , okay ? Yeah , right you are then . Okay , that 's it . That 's it , as fast as we can . - Good girl . - That 's it . All right ? - Almost there , Dad . - Easiest to have him in the cab . What do you think , Geraint ? Can you climb up ? - We 'll give you a hand . - I can do that , don 't worry . - Rhys , go around and pull him up . - Okay . Are they coming ? Is it safe ? Dad , don 't panic now . Try to stay calm . I 've got you . Hurry up . People are starting to notice . - It 's okay . - Dad . - He doesn 't look good . - What ? - Dad ? Dad ? - Gwen . Dad ? Dad ! We need some help , please . I need some help . Anyone , please , I need some help . - You 're a nurse . - Code 1- - assistance needed , please . - Code 1 ! I need assistance now ! - Come on ! He 's my patient . He 's already had a heart attack . Look , he 's my dad , okay ? He 's my father . Now I need you to look after him , please . Is it bad ? I got you . Dad . All right , this must be the module . I 'm inside . As you can see , they- - they treat the patients like- - like objects . This wall is cold . I was thinking it might be brick , but ... Ceramic maybe . These people are still alive . I 'm starting to think I 'm in a refrigeration unit . A lot of these patients are injured so I can 't tell if they 've been experimented on or not . And just for the record , this man is warm , which feels strange in this cold place . I 'm gonna go outside and see what I can find in this area . God knows what Phicorp is doing . But why the hell would they have all these bodies in one place ? I 'm sorry , where are you going ? - I want to see inside . - It 's just storage . Every time I want to see anything you turn me away . I 'm here to inspect so let me do my job . Storage ? This is storage ? - It 's a temporary measure . - Oh my God . We don 't have the staff . We don 't have the money . We don 't have the room . But who are they ? These are the ones without insurance . Where are the nurses ? Have they even been fed ? Excuse me . I 'm sorry , but how long have you been here ? Yesterday . They said we had to wait . These people , they 're just- - they 're pending . We 've got a couple glitches in the system , that 's all . I 'd point out that 10 days ago I had a job in public housing . I think I 've adapted very well . - Please , help me . - Holy shit . He 's wearing red . He 's got a red peg . But he can 't be , he conscious . So we made a mistake . Hundreds of patients , one mistake . That 's an excellent hit rate . But you made him Category 1 . He 's not 1 . He 's nowhere near 1 . Do you realize what happens when you make somebody 1 ? I think we should step outside . We 're disturbing the patients . What else are you hiding ? Is this laundry ? Are they bed sheets ? Oh my God , this place is stinking . I think you 've forgotten America 's in crisis . Times like this , somebody 's got to take charge . And in this instance it just happens to be me . - You think you 're doing a good job ? - I 'm under budget . You 're supposed to spend the money . Oh for God 's sake . That 's why a system like this is never gonna work- - because it 's always gonna be run by men like you . So what are you gonna do ? What are you gonna do , report me ? I 'm gonna do more than that . I 'm gonna have you prosecuted . Oh , you 're so full of it . You 're gonna be prosecuted for causing harm to those people in your care and you will be found guilty as charged . I guarantee you 're going to jail , you stupid little man . I 'm gonna see you inside a prison cell , you limp-dick little coward . Ralph , come on . Come on , arrest me . Oh don 't be so rid- - This lady wants to arrest me . You gonna do that ? Maybe you should both cool off . You should do it , Dr. Juarez . You 're so clever . Come on . Come on , arrest me . Get your hands the hell off me ! - Give me the gun ! - Oh my God ! Shut up . Both of you shut up ! You are going away forever ! Do you hear me ? You shot me ! No way ! Colin , that 's enough now , okay ? Get someone . Colin , think what you 're gonna say , okay ? 'Cause someone 's gonna hear those gunshots . It was a door . It was a door . Hear that ? Hear that , everybody ? It was a door ! It was only the door ! It was the door . It was the door . It was only the door . Get some- - Get me a car . Ralph , help me . Oh man , there 's blood everywhere . We can get her help . - Colin , she 's talking . - Just lift her goddamn feet . You 're an accomplice . Just do what I say . On the floor ? She 's fine . Sometimes the floor is fine . Hey , what is this place ? Okay , take the car . I 'll walk back . You didn 't see anything , okay ? Colin , you 've just got to stop and think . This is murder . No , it can 't be . Don 't you get that ? It 's a brand-new world , Ralph . A world with no more death . Which means there is no more murder . Now go . Go . Leave me my jacket . Ladies and gentlemen and children of the world , this is Los Angeles and this is the Miracle Rally . Whoo ! Ah . Okay . You 're on in five minutes . They 've cut you down to 90 seconds . - But here 's the new draft . - Oh , God damn it . And the keyword is still revelation . You got that ? Hmm ? You 've got to say revelation . Okay . Miss Kitzinger . Can I help you ? Just wanted to say you 're doing a very good job . Thank you . And you are ? This isn 't about me . You 're the one being noticed . By whom ? The right people . Good . Excellent . We should talk . We 'll see . He was fine . Then I sweep in like I 'm gonna solve everything . - And then I cause this . - You didn 't cause anything . He had another heart attack because I made him get up , Rhys . And your phone won 't stop bloody buzzing . It 's the supervisor . - I 'm supposed to be at work , remember ? - Go , go to work . Don 't let them give you the sack . We might still need that lorry . Go on , I 'll call you when I know something . I promise . Excuse me . Hi . Don 't want to bother you , but the man who had a heart attack , Geraint Cooper , he my dad . Sorry , your father 's being reclassified . - He 's Category 1 . - Um ... No no no , I read the definitions . Category 1 is like death . Well , your father is unconscious . His heart is failing . - But that 's not Category 1 . - I 'm sorry , the doctor decides , not me . Where is this doctor ? Because I need a word . Okay ? Because my father is not dead . Well , you 've got till tomorrow morning 'cause then we have to move him . Those are the instructions , I 'm afraid . All Category 1s go to the module . And what happens there ? Sorry , it 's not my area . Try asking admin . Wheel him out . Store him with the rest of the Cat 1s . I just got a call that Maloney 's golf cart is sitting outside the west block . Is he still on that tour ? I guess not . He called for a car . He did ? So that woman , Dr. Juarez , is she still here ? All right , I 've searched the perimeter . This place is sealed off . There are a total of three buildings in this module . But the capacity is small . There 's no way in hell that they 'll be able to accommodate all the Category 1 patients coming in . It 's impossible . Mr. Jack Harkness . I could accuse you of having an obsession with me . What happens afterward , Oswald , when the fever dies down and the world wakes up to the fact that a murderer is standing center stage ? Somewhere out there those men are waiting for you in the dark . I can smell them . Their pits are soaked with sweat and bile . But what if you became a hero instead ? Oh my , yeah . Certainly that would be good . You 're about to go out onstage and talk to the world with a happy little Phicorp speech , yeah ? But you could use this moment , Oswald . Here 's your speech . Say those words instead . Phicorp knew about the miracle . They 've been ready for years . That 's the proof all written down ready for everyone to hear it . You want my help ? I want anyone 's help . I 've never dealt with anything like this . It 's way beyond me . But you , you could expose Phicorp live on air and help me change the world . - We 'd be partners ? - Mmm . And what would I get out of it ? End the miracle ... Then you can die . You 're cursed with intelligence . Clever enough to know who you are and wise enough to want it to end . You help me and I promise I will help you to die . Oswald . Oswald , they 've been looking for you . - You 're on in 30 seconds . - Yeah sure . Certainly . Do the right thing , Oswald . - I 'm sorry , who are you ? - You 've got one chance . Take it . One chance for what ? What exactly did you just say to him ? Maybe you 're about to find out . Who are you ? Don 't miss the speech . One more thing , soldier . We 're ready to bring him out now . Wait a minute , Oswald . What did that man say to you ? - Revelation . - Oswald Danes ! That 's the keyword . Stick to the script . Say revelation . Kind of hard to see . What do I want ? That 's the question . All these years on this Earth , what do I really want ? Children , you bastard ! No . Because that 's my curse . I 'm cursed with the knowledge of that deep down in my soul , sir . And that 's my tragedy . It 's who I am . You 're a loser ! All these- - all right . All these fancy words , they 're no help to me . And these- - these- - these won 't help me either . The truth is I know what I am . And I know what you are too . Yes I do . Each and every one of you . Because I know for certain what has happened to the human race . I know because this has happened before . 50,000 years B.C. What 's called the great leap forward . Human beings suddenly , we started to bury our dead . We created art and money and love . They loved . They learned to love . We made a leap from animal to human . And now , right now , in our very own lifetimes , it has happened again . The next great leap . We have made it from animal to human to what ? This is the question . After Miracle Day what are we now ? I know . This is something I know because I am the man who has lost heaven forever . So I can feel the truth of it . I 'm telling you man has risen again . Now he has a new name . And his name is ... Angel . Angel . - Angel . - Crowd : Oswald ! Oswald ! We are angels . We have been elevated . He have been purified . We have been given life unending . We are the first angels on Earth . And I promise you this : There are even those who have been planning for this , the agents of angels in this brand-new world . I 'm telling you right now they stand amongst us . Yes ! For this is my ... Revelation ! Yeah ! Ha ha ha ! Oswald ! Oswald ! Oh my God . Holy shit . Vera , what happened ? Can you stand ? Help . Vera , come on . I can 't open it . - Rhys . - On my way back . They had me running patients to the burn center . Burn center ? Yeah , that 's what the driver said the modules are for . Burn victims . All done now though . Be there soon , okay ? You 've got to get out of there . It 's an oven , baby . Vera ! Vera ! Vera ! No ! Oswald ! Oswald ! Vera ! Vera . They 've built ovens . What do you mean ? They built ovens all over the world . That 's what the modules are , they 're ovens . They 're burning them . The patients , they 're burning them alive . = = sync , corrected by elderman = =

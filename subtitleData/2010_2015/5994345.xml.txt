 Sarah , we make a family . I 've already got a family . Who are you ? Family . MRS S : What is this ? Project LEDA ? She warned me about you . I swear to you , I don 't know who they are . The birdwatchers , my old network . Brenda ? You sold us to the Proletheans . ( GUNSHOT ) - Who is that ? - The y found polyps on my lungs . - Is she all right ? - She died . There 's loads of cabins and summer houses , we 'll just find an empty one and we 'll hole up . - You know him ? - Are you my dad ? He 's completely disconnected from all this shit we 're dealing with . There 's no place for me here . Can 't you stop running for a minute ? Today 's performance is dedicated to our dearly departed Aynsley . ♪ I 'll walk down the aisle ... ♪ Oh , my God ! Get up ! Get in ! Where did you get this ? CAL : Sarah ! Sarah ! Sarah ! Sarah ? Oh , shit ! I 'm sorry ! Come on . - It was you ? - Sarah ! I didn 't know what else to do . Where 's Kira ? Where 's Kira ? She 's not here . She 's fine , she 's fine . You hit your head . I 'm fine , I 'm fine . Come on . What are you doing ? Who the hell is this guy ? I think he 's dead . - We 've got to call the police . - No ! No ! No cops ! He shot a cop in my yard ! Cal . No cops ! I can 't do cops . We just need to get out of here now ! ( SIRENS BLARING ) SARAH : Shit ! It 's too late . Sarah ... Sarah ! What were you going to do ? You 're holding a murder weapon ! Shit , shit ! Okay , we need to ... We need to hide this . How long do you think you can hide this ? I just need a head start . Help me , please . Please ! ( SIRENS BLARING ) Bowman put out a call for back-up . CAL : So he 's responding . Jesus Christ ! SARAH : Shit ! - Where 's Kira ? - She 's safe , I told you . Hey , you got to tell me what the hell is going on . I 'm not doing that . I can 't do that . You know , Tom was a friend of mine . Shit ! I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , Cal . I didn 't mean for this to happen . As soon as I 've got Kira , we 're gone . We 're gone . I 'll deal with this on my own . Shit , whatever this is , I 'm in it . Just tell me what you did . At least tell me is anyone else after you ? Jesus Christ ! We need to get rid of this truck . Dad , it 's awake . She 's awake . She 's making noises , speaking in gibberish . It 's Ukrainian . She 's part of the family now , Gracie , understood ? Shh , shh ... Helena , easy now , easy now . My head hurts . That would be the sedative . Water helps . What did you do to me ? No , you 're injured , remember ? We 're trying to get you well . There were people all around me . That was just our family . No , that 's right , Helena . It 's okay . Everybody just came by to say , " Hey there . " Helena , I can 't imagine the kind of life you 've led up till now , but that 's all over and done with . We 're not like Tomas . We love you for who you are . You just rest . Don 't worry . Your life is here now with us . Shh . Shh . ( GROANING ) ( RETCHING ) ( COUGHING ) ( CONTINUES RETCHING ) ( COUGHING ) ( BREATHING DEEPLY ) ( FLUSH ES TOILET ) Well , bet you feel like shit . Uh , uh , you people can 't do this to me . We have a contract , we have an agreement . Not with me you don 't . I-I-I demand to speak to Dr Leekie right this second ! This is totally unacceptable . Okay , back it up and sit your ass down . I am not sitting my ass anywhere until I talk to Dr Leekie . Is that your dealer ? 'Cause he ain 't allowed in here . My dealer ? What are you ... What are you talking about ? This is the Dyad Institute . Institute ? This ain 't no institute . Where am I ? Girl , you 're in the middle of your wake-up call . You 're in rehab . ( STOMACH RUMBLING ) ( RETCH ES ) CAL : Don 't worry , the place is deserted . Nobody 's been here for years . Monkey ? - Mommy ! - Hey . Hi ! Ba by . Hello , hello . - I thought you were gone . - I 'm here , baby . - Hi . - Call : old me to hide . Good job , Kira . I couldn 't see you at all . Hey , thank you . Yeah . I have a surprise for you , Kira . Come on . - A camper ! - It 's cool , huh ? - Uh-huh . - There 's a kitchen , a bathroom . - You want to look ? - SARAH : Yeah , go ahead . Go ahead . They 'll be looking for my truck , I 'll stash it inside and we 'll keep going . Is this yours ? You won 't answer my questions , don 't ask your own . If it 's registered to you , they 're going to be looking for it . It 's not in my name , all right ? Mommy , there 's a TV and a laptop and a bed in the top . Whoa ! Let 's check it out ! Let 's check it out . - Well ... - Yeah . What are we waiting for ? He 's out there again . Ah , there 's nothing to worry about , Bonnie . They can take all the pictures they want . There 's nothing to see here . BONNIE : There wasn 't until a few days ago . You don 't think we should have brought her here ? I think it would have been easier on Gracie . - Gracie needs to open her heart . - And she will . I just think another location would have been safer , at least for a while . Now , you let me worry about our safety . All right ? ( SHUTTER CLICKING ) CAL : She asleep ? SARAH : Yeah , I don 't know how she does it . She 's with her mom , she 'll be okay . - Where are you taking us ? - Depends who 's after you . I mean , he wasn 't just another angry mark , was he ? Cal , just ... I gotta know what I 'm dealing with . All right . That guy back there , he belonged to a very serious bitch at a very powerful corporation . So you 're , you 're scamming corporations now . That 's almost a relief . ( MOBILE VIBRATING ) - The guy 's phone ? - Yeah . I watched him unlock it . It 's her . As long as they think I 'm still caught , then they 're not going to send anybody after us . For a while . SARAH : Can you get me online ? Stop it ! Stop it ! just leave us alone ! Just stop it ! ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Go back to hell where you belong . Shh , shh . You sleep now . ( MEN CHATTING IN DISTINCTLY ) Henrik ! ( GRUNTS ) Oh , shit ! Hey . Hey ! Hey ! Hello , gentlemen ! You 're trespassing , Detective Bell . No , I was just out for a hike . Taking a few nature shots and I got a little turned around . This is private property . Actually , the property line ends back there . Which means all you boys have long-gun permits as required by law to be packing these things on public land . Right ? - Let 's go . See you again , detective . - Oh , you bet . You know , the worst part of it is , uh , people looking at you when you tell them that you 're sick . They 're not sure how to react . Like , does she want me to cry or act like I don 't care ? ( SKYPE TONE RINGING ) - Hey , Sarah ! - Hey ! Where the hell are you ? Uh , I 'm in my new lab . Thank you very much . They let you out ? You look like you could use some sun , Cosima . No , I 'm good , I 'm good . Where the hell are you ? Why are we stopped out here ? Because your mom wanted to talk to someone . Aunt Cosima . ( RADIO CHATTER ) I guess . And out here it 's so open we can pick up a signal for miles . Are those police talking ? Look , this is another cool trick I learned . COSIMA : Holy shit , Sarah . Yeah , so for now , I 'm just texting as Daniel . Rachel still thinks I 'm caught . Hey , let me see that , that photo again . Project LEDA . You know the , uh , the mythology of Leda and the Swan ? Uh-uh . Must have missed that class . Okay , so Zeus , the big guy of the gods , he comes down from Mount Olympus in the guise of a swan . And he gets it on with this human queen called Leda . Um , they have twins and the kids are half-human , half-god . - Weird , right ? - Yeah , very weird . What does that have to do with anything ? Project LEDA . I mean , it 's total military speak . Isn 't it ? And what 's with that soldier in the background ? What , you think the military created us ? I don 't know . I don 't know . But this , this , this could be key , Sarah . CAL : Now you turn it around ... I 'm going to come back tonight . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Don 't you think that 's really dangerous ? Mrs S lied straight to my face about Project LEDA . I need to know where she is , I need to know what she knows . She 's the key to all of this . Okay , let me handle this LEDA stuff . Uh , you just take care . Bye . ( COUGHING ) - Ta-da ! - It 's an angel . Well , I thought it was a butterfly but an angel will do . - Thank you . - Sure . ( RADIO CHATTER CONTINUES ) How did you do that ? They put up roadblocks but they 're behind us . There 's a BOLO out on my truck . - A " be on the lookout " . - Yeah , I know what it means . I don 't know why you 're doing any of this , Cal . I need a favour . I have to go back home to find someone . - Jesus ! - Hello , Benjamin . Siobhan , you 're okay ? Why wouldn 't I be ? I heard that someone did the birdwatchers . - You ! - It was a trap . It backfired . I didn 't ... I had no idea . If you had , we wouldn 't be talking right now . - What do you want ? - New papers . I have to get to London to find somebody . If it 's who I think it is , you don 't have to go to London . He came through a week ago . Carlton 's here . - Felix ! - Oh , my God ! Hi ! So this is what the world looks like sober . Thank God you 're here . They won 't let me out unless somebody takes me . What do you mean ? What about Donnie ? He put me here ! He 's my monitor . - Are you sure ? - Yes , yes , yes , he institutionalised me . No , darling , I mean that rehab usually requires some form of consent . This was my idea ? Oh , God ! Okay , let 's have seat . Oh , God ! I don 't remember the curtain going up . Was I terrible ? People got their money 's worth . ( SIGHS ) - Oh , look at my arm , I 'm a mess . - Okay , let 's look at this as a chance to relax . I 'm in rehab , Felix , there are drunks . Drug addicts . I saw a woman shaving her armpits . That 's disturbing but sort of the point , love . Look , a week here is not a bad thing . You go away for a week , you come back from the spa , fresh as a daisy , no one 's the wiser , plus no Donnie . - Okay , one week . - Brilliant ! We 'll celebrate with brunch and mimosas . Oh , God , or just brunch . SARAH : You and Cal are going to stay in the camper tonight . Are you going to find Mrs S ? Yes , and make sure that Uncle Felix isn 't still angry at me . Rig ht ? Yea h . Okay . Bye , babes . Here . This will keep you safe . Thank you . Hey ! The bus can wait . Are you sure about this ? Are you ? Well , I 've never really been a dad before . Thank you . Uh , you should ... - You guys should get on the road . - Yeah . - If anything happens , you just ... - I 'll text you a safe number . I 'll see you here in six hours . Right . What 's the corporation ? - Eh ? - just give me the name . Dyad Group . You must have really gotten under their skin . They sort of got under mine first . How 'd you find me ? I heard you were in the neighbourhood , so I looked for the nearest place to find a pint and a pair of tits . - I do have my weaknesses . - Well , let me go or you 'll have a few more ! ( GRUNTING AND LAUGHING ) There they are . Eyes that could make me stab me own mum if they asked . ( CHUCKLING ) Still a poet . I wasn 't sure I 'd ever see you again . It took me a long time to come to terms with that . And now that you have seen me again ? I 'm not sure this is wise at all . God , I missed you , woman . Well , I thought about you once or twice . What about your friend upstairs ? - We could go ask her to join us . - ( LAUGHING ) Careful . - My room 's around the corner . - Don 't tell me you 've gotten shy . ( LAUGHING ) ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) FELIX : I 'll have you know , I 'm versed in Krav Maga ! Shit ! Fe ! You 're a shite burglar . Why the hell didn 't you answer any of my texts ? FELIX : Texts from you ? - I must have been busy . - Ha-ha . Where 's my niece ? Shit hit the fan . You left her with Cal ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . I 'll explain later . Anything from Siobhan ? Anything ? Nothing from Mumsy , no . Alison 's in recovery . Cosima and Delphine are locked in some kind of transgressive lesbian geek spiral bound to end in tears . Wait , did you say recovery ? Is she in rehab ? You know , I think it will be good for her . Help her to get back some of her dignity . ( URINATING ) Do you have to watch me tinkle every time ? Mmm-hmm . Test every day . So we 're clear , no drugs or alcohol of any kind . Any prescribed medication you get from the desk . - We watch you take it . - I 'm not on anything . - No birth control ? - No . That was never necessary . Well , you won 't need it in here , anyway , 'cause there 's no relations , especially with other residents . Oh , God , I 'm married . You 're also an addict ! Addicts do stupid shit . You get caught doing the nasty with anyone in here , you 're out on your ass . I don 't believe I 've ever done the nasty . - This room will stay private ? - Alison ! Um , no , I don 't want to talk to him . He 's an enabler , Yvonne . You want I should check his crevices ? - You put me in here ! - Ali , you agreed . I just want what 's best for you . I can leave any time I want to . I don 't think that 'd be such a great idea . Really , Donnie ? - Spying , leeching Donnie . - Ali , - you have issues . - ( SCOFFS ) And until you get those sorted out , I don 't think you should be around the children . That is not your decision to make . It is if you leave rehab before the programme 's finished . At least , that 's what my lawyer says . Get well , Ali . So , what exactly do we expect to find down memory lane ? Something about S 's network . Which has got to be somewhere . Yeah ? Maybe it 's with one of these people in here . Hello , stallion . SARAH : Yeah , that 's Carlton . He brought me to S when I was a kid . She said he was in prison . Oi , what 's this ? " Carlton Bedding , human smuggler . " Yeah , his , um , pipeline . He used to hide people . He got 15 years for it . " Six scientists incinerated in lab explosion " while working on a medical research project " spearheaded by Professors Susan and Ethan Duncan . " Duncan ? As in Rachel Duncan ? SARAH : Is this them , then ? Project LEDA . FELIX : Holy shit ! These were Rachel 's parents . Does that mean that Mrs S knew the whole time ? What else is she not bloody telling us ? You 're still bloody spectacular . Well , you have been locked up for a really long time but yeah , I am . ( BOTH CHUCKLING ) Still , you didn 't cross the pond just to see me , did you ? Uh , Brenda was compromised . I heard that , too . Amelia came back after all this time . - So you know why I 'm here . - LEDA . - Kassov was the ferryman . - ( SCOFFS ) I need more than that . The ferryman 's all I have . Twenty years ago , you brought an orphan to my door . " Put her in the black , " you said . " As black as it gets . " And I didn 't ask much but now I know . I know what she is , old friend . Then you know more than me . And I don 't want to hear it . At least take me as far as Kassov . If Sarah digs any further into this , God knows a whole world of shit is going to unravel . So I take it you 're going back to Kira and that Davy Crockett ? ( CHUCKLES ) Yeah , 1 am . ( MOBILE VIBRATING ) - Is that Rachel ? - Yeah . - Still got time . - Time for what ? What 's the first rule of war , Fe ? Don 't mix your camouflage ? Know your enemy . Rachel 's got an apartment at the Cairn Arms . Nice digs . Those are executive suites . You 've been there ? Well , I can 't really divulge beyond the sordid but , um , there was this really cute concierge named Troy - and I can distract ... - No , no , no , no , no , you need to bring these to Cosima . Tell her to find out what she can about the Duncans . Right . ( CREAKING ) Yes , Miss Duncan . Of course , Miss Duncan . - I 'm almost there . Yes . - ( LIFT BELL DINGS ) TROY : Yes . I 'd like the lights on and the suite to be a perfect 68 degrees . Is that clear , Troy ? Absolutely , Miss Duncan . - I 'm taking care of it right now . - And don 't linger , Troy . - I 'll know if you do . - Of course not . ( ALARM BEEPING SOFTLY ) ( MOBILE VIBRATING ) - Yeah . - Hey . Hey , are you in ? - What 's it like ? - Straight out of Cold Bitch Digest . COSIMA : Let me talk to her . FELIX : Okay . Sarah , are you seriously in the inner sanctum ? Yeah . What did you find out about the professors ? Okay , Susan and Ethan Duncan , they were geneticists , both British citizens , um , they went to Cambridge for molecular biology . In ' 74 , they joint-published a paper on recombinant DNA and there were several more papers that they published after that , until the last one in ' 76 . Is that when they started Project LEDA ? Yeah , well , it makes sense if they were working on something totally top secret because they kind of disappear until the big lab explosion . So , they were Rachel 's parents , then ? Adoptive parents . I mean , Amelia carried you for them until she hid you and then ... And then they somehow ended up with Rachel instead . FELIX : just think , Sarah , you could have been Rachel . Well , she 's got good taste . And a boy toy . FELIX : Oh , really ? Well , at least she 's got feelings somewhere in her body . Yeah , just not in her soul . You know , she would have been raised totally self-aware . ( STAMMERING ) And that sense of being the only self-aware clone might have created a very profound sense of narcissism . She probably thinks that she 's elite . I feel like the whole thing would have been very clinical , like every aspect of her life totally controlled for one singular purpose . She would have been raised without any emotional attachments , so that she could be the perfect , like , corporate leader , totally able to make decisions based solely on strategic advantage . FELIX : $ 0 , Rachel 3 evil because Mummy and Daddy didn 't hug her enough ? I love you , too , Daddy . I don 't think so . COSIMA : Well , the psychology makes sense , Sarah . Shit , I gotta go . It 's me . Yeah , well , there 's been a problem . Sarah Manning 's gone . I did and now I don 't . There was an accident . No , she took it with her . I don 't know . No , Rachel 's not back till morning . No , she has no idea and she 's not going to find out . Leekie , relax ! We 'll find Sarah and we 'll find out what she knows . Gently , yes . Yes . Well , look who it is . You can 't shoot me , can you ? You 're not allowed to . Right ? You 're right . ( STRUMMING GUITAR ) My mom 's not coming tonight , is she ? She 's late , probably not . Hey , we 'll talk to her tomorrow . Are you sad ? Sad 's okay sometimes . just don 't be worried . I 'm not . She has a guardian angel . It 's cute . Thought this would be a good place to talk . Easier to clean up after . Tell me where you got this and who else knows about it . Better idea . Eat me . ( SIGHS ) You 're not really the smartest clone , are you ? Smart enough to know you 're shagging Rachel . The way you operate , that means you 're her monitor , right ? You report to Leekie on her . I thought it would be somebody higher up . Somebody who looks like me . Well , don 't flatter yourself . There 's already too many of you . Daniel ... What are you so scared for us to find out about Project LEDA ? What makes you think you 're going to be able to tell anyone when we 're done ? You wouldn 't ... - Daniel ... Daniel ... - What ? I look like her , don 't I ? I look just like her . This is happening . - You wouldn 't . - Leekie wouldn 't . Rachel might . But this , this is for me . No ... No ... Don 't fight . ( SCREAMING ) ( MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO ) ( WHIMPERING ) Don 't go anywhere . ( COCKS GUN ) ( THUDDING , GLASS SHATTERING ) ( BANGING , GRUNTING ) ( CHOKING ) ( SARAH SCREAMING ) ( SHUSHING ) Shh ! Hello , sestra . Good to see you . Helena , what you doing here ? I followed you from Mother 's house . I shot you . You were dead . - You were dead ! - Yes , you did . It 's a miracle . And we were meant to be together . Stay away from me ! Please , sestra , I need your help . Don 't send me back . I was married . I think he took something from inside of me . ( WHIMPERING ) Gracie 's sleeping . We searched everywhere but we lost Helena . Well , just when the night is darkest , He shines a light . And a new life begins . Hallelujah . I didn 't think your mom had any sisters . KIRA : They 're new . It 's a promotion , Paul . Are you asking me if I 'm interested or reminding me I have no choice ? You 're safe here . He wants to help you and Sarah . Shut down the tests . Until Sarah comes to heel , Cosima will suffer . Ripped By mstoll

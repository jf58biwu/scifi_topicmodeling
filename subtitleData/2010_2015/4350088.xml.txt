 [ Wedeck ] Previously on FlashForward : - You want to tell me what this is ? - [ Gabriel ] My book . It 's all there . - We need someone on the inside . - You want me to be a double agent ? This is where you get to prove your dedication to the cause , darlin ' . - We need you to kill Benford . - What 's up with you ? I 'm pregnant . Mark , I just hope that you know you can still count on me . - I never doubted that . - I could 've used you , Stan . Now , I gotta deal with Vice President Clemente . In my vision , it was clear that Jericho had done some things that threatened our national security . [ Wedeck ] You got military clearance . As soon as you can document what Tracy knows , I want it uploaded . As of this moment , the world thinks you and Simcoe accidentally caused this blackout . What happens if they find out you were awake while it happened ? - [ Mark ] Simon Campos has disappeared . - [ Wedeck ] He took the damn ring . Did you overhear anything ? They said he 's going to cause another blackout . [ Wedeck ] On October 6th , the planet blacked out for two minutes and 17 seconds . And the whole world saw the future . [ Wedeck ] Some of us were alarmed by what we saw . Others were elated and rejoiced . Still others saw nothing at all . They were left confused , concerned and otherwise uncertain . But that uncertainty will soon be resolved . Tomorrow is D-day , the day we catch up to the flash forwards . Our future , both as individuals and as a collective , is upon us . This building may very well come under attack tomorrow night . But we will not back down . We are the FBI and we will be open for business . That said , the Director is instituting high-maximum alert protocols and procedures . Agents Benford and Noh will be coordinating SWAT and sniper teams to provide external security and support . Vreede , Hawk will be briefing supervisors on additional OPS plans . We are in uncharted waters , people , but we will get through this together . That 's all . [ Wedeck ] Mark , walk with me . Simon Campos ? His photo 's out to all local and national agencies . - His cell phone ? - So far , inactive . What about his sister ? She 's back with the family in Toronto . - Maybe he 'll try and contact her . - RCMP is sitting on the house . We also have a trap and trace on their phones . He 's gone underground and taken that QED ring with him . - I want him back here immediately . - We 're on it . Gentlemen , this is turning into one hell of a day . [ Man ] Once again , we have breaking news out of Los Angeles . - [ Wedeck ] What is this ? - WIKR has just obtained footage of what appears to be a man who was awake during the global blackout . I gave strict orders for this to be kept under wraps . Who released this ? Wait a minute . Wait a minute . This isn 't us . [ Man ] Authorities are still trying to identify the man , but ... - [ Mark ] It 's a different angle . - He 's right . - No one 's seen this on our end . - Well , where did it come from ? The better question is , " Why now ? " [ Man ] With April 29th only one day away , the stunned world wonders : Who is this man and why was he awake ? [ Simon ] Hi . My name 's David Walker . David Walker . David Walker . David Walker . David Walker . Hi . My name 's David Walker . Hey , my name 's Dave Walker . - Dave Walker ... - [ woman ] Is this seat taken ? All yours . Hey , haven 't I seen you somewhere before ? Me ? No , no . You have such a cute face , Simon . Don 't hide it . - Who are you ? - Lita . - And if you run , they will find you . - What do you want ? - I 'm here with an offer . - An offer ? Like what , take my last remaining nine fingers and kill my mother ? You 'll want to hear us out . Simon , please . I 'm dying of thirst . Just pour me one drink . Well , I suppose a taste wouldn 't hurt . - What 'll it be ? - Not here . Yeah . This is Agent Noh , N-O-H , of the FBI . I need to speak to the news director that took possession of the Suspect Zero footage . Yeah . Well , see if you can find him . I 'll hold . Hey . - What are you doing here ? - Hi . - Is something wrong ? - No , no . I 'm just , uh , surprised to see you . What 's going on ? I was in court over on Spring . I , um ... need a favor . - What 's up ? - Take tomorrow off . Tomorrow ? Not a chance . You know what tomorrow is . Exactly . I looked into airfare to Hawaii . Dirt cheap . Apparently , people are afraid to fly on flash forward day ... - Baby , listen ... - We can make this happen . Tomorrow can be whatever we want it to be . We 're not tied down to anything now . Let 's just go . Listen , we can 't just pretend I 'm not connected to other people , all right ? You know what 's supposed to happen to Mark , and there 's Janis and there 's Wedeck ... For once baby , can this just be about you and me ? I 'm gonna be on this plane tomorrow . I 'm hoping you will be , too . This isn 't fair . - [ Phone beeps ] - Hold on . Hi . Yeah . This is Agent Noh from the FBI . Yeah . I need to speak to your news director , whoever took possession of the Suspect Zero footage . I need to know how you got it . [ Wedeck ] I got McDow in your office . Olivia 's with him . - [ Mark ] Why ? - They 've got some kind of connection . She keeps him calm . If he knows anything about who 's going to attack this office tomorrow night , I want to be the first to hear about it . [ Gabriel ] That 's not right . That 's in the wrong place . - I don 't think you should touch that . - No , but it 's not right . - [ Mark ] Hey , hey ! - [ Gabriel ] It 's not right ... - [ Olivia ] Don 't touch it ! - Could you leave those ? - Sure . - Please ? - [ Gabriel ] It 's not right as rain . - Gabriel . - So many things I missed before . - Gabriel . My name is Mark . Yeah , you 're Mark Benford . She 's Olivia Simcoe . I 'm gonna meet Stanford Wedeck and Janis Hawk when they walk through that door in about five minutes . - Wait . Go back . - Go back to the drawing board . - It 's not right . See ? See it ? - No ? Right time , wrong place . See ? It 's not right . And this , that 's not right . - May I take a look at that ? - It 's my book . You be careful . [ Gabriel ] It 's my book . It 's my book . Gabriel , how ... How did you draw this ? With a pen . With a pen . With a red pen because I like to use the red pen for the lines . [ Olivia ] Gabriel was given multiple flash forwards . - So he may have been here before . - I was here . With Dr. Frost . Dyson Frost ? He told my mother he 'd take care of me . He didn 't say it would be good care . It wasn 't . Olivia took good care of me at the hospital . I got some new shoes . You like my new shoes ? - They 're cute . - And I have a huge hippocampus . FYI . - Thanks . Thanks for bringing him in . - [ Olivia ] Glad I could help . We have to formally debrief him , though . - OK . Uh , Gabriel ? - Mm-hmm ? - I 'm gonna go now ... - [ Gabriel ] Right . Should I ... Should I stay or should I go now , too ? - You 're staying . No . - You 're staying ? - [ Olivia ] No , I 'm ... You 're staying . - [ Gabriel ] No , you 're gonna stay . - No , please ... - No , you 're gonna stay . - OK . Can you let go of my arm ? - OK . - [ Gabriel ] No , you 're staying . - Can you let go of my arm ? - Hey , Gabriel ... - Hey , hey ! You can 't touch ! - [ Gabriel ] You can 't touch this ! - Hey , Gabe . It 's OK . - You can 't touch this ! - [ Olivia ] Gabriel , it 's OK . It 's OK . - Maybe I should stay . - I think that 's a good idea . - OK . Everything 's OK . It 's all OK . - [ Gabriel ] It 's OK now ? - See ? It 's OK . You want a soda ? - Yeah . Can I have a soda ? - [ Olivia ] Yeah . - [ Gabriel ] With a straw ? OK . Good . Here we go . [ Olivia ] OK . It 's over . I 'm done . Pull me out . - I 've gone as far as I 'm willing to go . - Just take a breath . They want me to kill Mark . I tried to stall by going to DC , but Carline 's been calling me every single hour . You can 't say no . What am I supposed to do ? He 's an FBI agent . He 's my friend . I 'm not gonna do it . If you say no , they 'll find someone else to kill him . And then they 'll kill you . There is no coming in from the cold here , Agent Hawk . The only way out is to finish what we started . Look at me . We 're close . Fine . But they 're getting antsy . They 're gonna burn me if I don 't give them something big . Then give them something big . I tried calling you last night . And the night before that . Yeah , I know . I 'm sorry . Things have been really crazy . Listen , I didn 't want to talk to you about this at work , but I think we need a plan . - Dem , I 'm really busy . Do you think we can talk about this later ? Um ... I want to be a part of what 's going on with this baby . Demetri , I really appreciate that you were there for me when I needed you , but you don 't have to do anything now . She 's my responsibility . It 's fine . What if that 's not OK with me ? What if I don 't wanna walk away ? Dem , you have a second chance at life . You and Zoey should make the best of it . I put everything in place for the security detail at the house tomorrow . OK . I 'll have them lay low , so as not to upset Charlie . - What 's the matter ? - I don 't know , Mark . It 's just weird . It 's weird to be talking to you about security details and not , I don 't know , garage door openers and parent-teacher conferences . Yeah . I wish I had something to say that would make it easier . [ Humming ] Gotta make it right . Yeah . Gotta make it right ... It 's wrong . Right as rain . Yeah . That 's right . Hey , Gabriel , I thought I told you ... What 's he doing in here by himself ? - Where 's Vreede ? - He went to get my book . - It 's not in the right place . - Vreede ! I can 't just have you just pulling things apart like this . - I 'm sorry , Mark . - There you go . OK . Make it look right . - I don 't understand . - You . You make it look right . - Make ... - You make it look like this . Like that . [ Camera shutter clicking ] [ Khamir ] That 's where they 're holding Tracy . Joshua Base . Jericho has these bases all over . None of them on a map . They kidnap , imprison , torture whoever they want . A shadow army . That does things your government wants to do , but legally can 't . Who are you sending those to ? Someone who shares your belief that Jericho are criminals . There . That 's where they conduct all the interrogations . Tracy will be in there . We get these uploaded , then we get my daughter back . [ Speaking foreign language ] [ Woman ] Authorities have identified him as physicist Simon Campos ... [ Simon ] Run away with me . Where would we go ? Well , I would say Paris , but you messed that up when your people plastered my face all over the news . Don 't get snippy with me . I 'm just the messenger . Besides , Hellinger wants to help you . - Who 's Hellinger ? - Hellinger 's our boss . I don 't have a boss . Everyone has a boss . He paid for your school , got you a job equal to your talents , protected you along the way . He 's the big guy . Piss off . I 'm done paying my debts . Hey , we 're not the enemy . In fact , we 're your only friends . Well , I have a message for your friends . I 'm done dealing with lower-level functionaries . I thought I sent that message with Flosso . These things need to be face-to-face . Believe me , he got that message , and he 's anxious to speak with you . Then why are you here ? Trying to keep you in one place . [ Knocking on door ] - One thing you should know ... - [ door unlocking ] He 's a very charming man ... until he 's not . Mr. Campos . Let 's share a drink , shall we ? Yeah , all of them . Yeah . We were all together at Raven River . - And you 're certain about her ? - Nhadra ? Nhadra . Yeah . Nhadra had a nice smile . Not in this picture , but Nhadra had a nice smile . And this is Kent . This is a terrible picture of Kent . Kent 's my friend . Although technically he 's dead , he 's still my friend . So all of these people were together and they 're all connected by the experiment ? [ Mark ] I think we can posit that Raven River was some kind of research and development , and Somalia was an alpha test for the GBO on October 6th . Or October 6 was the beta test and this is just the beginning . Gabriel , do you have any idea when the next one will be ? The next global blackout ? We need your help with this . Is there a specific date or time ? Dr. Frost was in charge . He chose the time and the day . I just went on my trips , is all . I just went on my trips and then I wrote down the notes . Dyson Frost ran the experiments by himself ? - Was there anyone else ? - Oh ... yes . Yeah , the Big Guy . He 's the boss . Big Guy . You have his picture ? I drew his picture . He 's very clean . Does big guy have a name ? I just told you his name . His name is Big Guy . - And where is his picture ? - In my book . - This one ? - Yeah . Page 15 . It 's ... It 's a good picture . In the black pen . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . That 's Big Guy . Yeah , Big Guy . Yeah . Gabriel , I need you to tell me everything you know about this man . [ Demetri ] Hey , sorry to interrupt . Mark , can I talk to you for a minute ? - Hey , what 's up ? It 's OK . - [ Whimpering ] Not safe . It 's not safe . - You 're safe here . - It 's fine . I 'm fine . He 's not supposed to be here right now . He died . You died . They were very sad that day . But that 's the way it has to go if things are gonna work out right . You died . You died that day . Can you imagine what vile diseased lips last touched these glasses ? Or those sheets ? I 'd hate to see them under a black light . The life of Suspect Zero . Yeah . You 'd be surprised what you get used to . So ... We 're about a day away from the 29th . It 's time to come home , Simon . Piss off . Can we get a little ice in here , please , Lita ? You have every right to be angry . Oh , I 'm way past angry , mate . Where do you go from here , Simon ? You 're a fugitive from the FBI , the whole world , for that matter . Your life 's work is over . You have nothing . You ... You are nothing . I can give it all back to you . Come work for us . You will be protected . Your work will continue . And we can even arrange for you to see your family from time to time . Your dear Anabelle . That 's the carrot , what 's the stick ? The stick is the stick . I don 't even want to consider that . Because there is no stick . What are you gonna do ? Kill my family ? Cut me up ? Hasn 't worked so far . You need me . Otherwise I wouldn 't be here . At some point , we will cut our losses . I 'm the only person that can calibrate the accelerator . And you know it . This is your final offer . I 'd say sleep on it , but we 're running out of time . Yeah . Well , you 'll be receiving my response soon enough . [ Mark ] Maybe Gabriel 's " Big Guy " can give us a lead on Simon . We 'll run this through facial recognition analysis . Get it out worldwide . We 're closing in , Demetri . Hey , you with me ? Yeah . I 'm sorry . Sorry . - Did McDow get under your skin ? - A little . And the whole thing with Slingerland trying to kill people to course-correct the universe , and Dyson Frost and his Garden of Forking Paths , now this guy . I know where you 're headed with this . Don 't go there . You believe any of this stuff ? That the universe is somehow pushing us towards one certain outcome ? No . Then my being alive isn 't somehow screwing things up ? Oh , I think you 're screwing a lot of things up , but the universe has nothing to do with it . Thank you . That was ... That was really touching . Happy to help . [ Demetri ] You know , after 10 : 00 tomorrow night , we 're gonna have to go back to living the way we used to . Think ... Not looking ahead . Gotta say , kinda looking forward to it . Yeah . Me , too . Lloyd . Lloyd . [ chuckling ] Lloyd ... I can see you 're feeling better , Gabriel . Yeah , well , I have a huge hippocampus , FYI . Yeah , [ stuttering ] Olivia told me so . Olivia said so . - Well , she would know . - Yeah . - How 's the debriefing ? - Uh , stressful . Very stressful . Very stressful . - Yeah , I know . I 've been there . - How 's it going without Simon ? Struggling with the decoherence equation . Yeah , the equation . Yeah , the equ ... The equation . Yeah , you ... you do the math . Do the math . I don 't do math . I do art . You do the math . Do the numbers . You do the numbers together . They have to be in the right order , though . And then you 're both part of the equation . Both of you . Part of the equation , yeah . [ Wedeck ] This confirms Clemente 's suspicions . This entire operation is not supposed to exist . - You got what you 're looking for ? - [ Wedeck ] I do . - You 've done a great job , Aaron . - Then it 's time to get Tracy . You 're not going in there ? - Yes , I am . - [ Wedeck ] Don 't . Please . Sit tight . At least until I can get the military there to back you up . Negative . My daughter is now the priority . - I 've held up my end of the deal . - I know and I appreciate that , Aaron , but I want to keep you safe . Stay where you are . I can 't . Damn it ! Hey . Tracy . They 're putting her in the truck . Let 's go . [ Speaks foreign language ] [ Woman ] I 'm running out of excuses for you , darling . You asked me to kill my friend , Carline , not to bake a cake . I didn 't ask you to do anything . And when I tell you something needs to be done , you need to do it . I understand that , but Benford 's an FBI agent . I can 't just walk into the office and shoot him in the head . - I 'll take care of it . - When ? When I can do it without getting myself killed in the process . Well , it better be before tomorrow night . - Why ? - Questions get you killed , sweet pea . Where are we with Mosaic ? Oh , don 't piddle , Janis . You are hanging on by a thread . If I go back empty-handed , it 's over for you . You have a baby to think about . - Gabriel McDow . Do you know him ? - Yeah , I know Gabe . He 's in the FBI right now laying the whole thing out . Raven River , Dyson Frost , all of it . And they 're buying it ? They know he 's a gold mine and that your people want him dead . Well , he has been a bit of sand in the petroleum jelly . Can you deliver him ? He 's being moved to a safe house . I can tell you when and where . I don 't care what they say about you . You 're worth the money , honey . News director says the Suspect Zero footage came on a flash drive , delivered by messenger . I 've got Forensics on the envelope . Review the surveillance tapes from the cable news building . I want to talk to that messenger . Hey . Marshals have a safe house available in Sylmar . - It 's our best option for McDow . - Sylmar 's overused . - How about Silver Strand Beach ? - DEA 's using it . Sylmar it is . We 're on the move within the hour . McDow 's gonna blow a gasket if we separate him from Olivia . I 'll let you break the news . Thanks . [ Bubbling ] [ Knocking ] Olivia , could I talk to you for a minute , please ? - Sure . - Thank you . I 'll be right back , Gabriel . I 'm gonna be right outside , OK ? Right there . Hey , Gabriel . We 're gonna take you to your new house . You 'll like it there . - Can you tell me what you see ? - Loose ends . Yeah . I know the feeling . Listen , before you go , I need to ask something . You called ... You said ... Olivia ... - Olivia Simcoe . - Olivia Simcoe , yes . - That 's right . - Yes . And I need to know ... is that how this all turns out ? It 's what I 've seen . I see so many things . So many things I see come true . And I 've been waiting a long time . Is she gonna be OK ? Will she be safe ? Yes . Yes . [ Man ] That 's far enough . Let 's put her down over there and start digging . [ Gunshot ] - [ Gunshot ] - [ Grunt ] Nice shot . - [ Khamir ] Don 't move . Don 't move ! - [ Aaron ] Tracy . - Don 't move ! Don 't move ! - Tracy . Tracy . It 's me . It 's Dad . You 're safe now , sweetheart , you 're safe . Aaron , we 've got to move and take cover . I 'll assess her injuries over there . Please . It 's OK . You 're gonna be OK . I got you . I got you . I got you . [ Beeping ] [ Exhales ] Daisy . Yes . It 's Stan . Can you get the president for me ? Put him through . - Big day tomorrow , Stan ? - Yes . - Yes , it is . Listen , Dave ... - What 's wrong ? I 'm sitting here with something . Something I don 't want . - It has to do with you . - Well , you know all my secrets , Stan . We 've come all this way . How bad could it be ? Joshua Base . It doesn 't ring a bell . Then I have nothing to worry about if I turn these photos over to Clemente - for further investigation . - Why Clemente ? Have you ever asked your vice president what she saw happening tomorrow ? I always knew this call was coming . I just never figured it would come from you . I appreciate the call , Assistant Director Wedeck . [ Dial tone ] Assistant Director Stanford Wedeck for Vice President Clemente . - Gentlemen , we all squared away ? - Ready to go . - How you doing , Gabriel ? - I 'm bulletproof now . - Feels good , doesn 't it ? - Yep . Yep . - Where 's Dem ? - Prepping the van . Let 's go . McDow is on the move . Black van . Two agents , two SWAT , heavily armed . 118 East to Sylmar , exit Foothill towards Arroyo . 20 minutes . [ Man ] Copy that . We 're on our way . [ Man ] It 's the day before the flash forward , and once again , everyone 's asking , " What did you see ? " So I 'll tell you exactly what I saw . I was , I will be ... Enjoying atomic wings at Wing A Ding Ding off Tujunga . Tuesday night is Ladies ' Night , where ladies ... Jackass . Sounds good to me . - [ Tires screeching ] - [ Honking ] This guy didn 't even think about using his blinker . - Learn the rules , son ! - [ Honking ] - You all right back there ? - We 're good . We 're good . We 're good . Dem , check this out . [ Demetri ] Get out of here . Reverse . Reverse ! Go ! Come on , Vreede ! [ Tires screeching ] Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! Don 't ! - [ All shouting ] - Don 't ! Don 't ! Don 't shoot ! - On the ground ! On the ground ! - [ Man ] Drop your weapon ! [ Mark ] Play along . Just play along . We 're after the Big Guy , OK ? Call your boss . Tell him you have your man . On the ground ! - [ Demetri ] Are we clear ? - [ Mark ] Got ' em . [ Khamir ] My men will interrogate this soldier . We 'll see what he knows about Tracy . There must be a military hospital back near Kandahar . No . The roads are too dangerous . - They 'll flag us at the checkpoints . - Screw the checkpoints . Even if we managed to get there without getting killed , - I don 't think she 'll survive the ride . - Hold on , honey . - I got you . - Daddy . - Aaron , we can 't go back now . - You listen to me , buddy . We are gonna drive back to Kandahar and you 're going to save her life . - Aaron , we can 't ... - I saw her alive . She 's gonna make it . We all are . Now drive . Hold on , sweetheart . I got you . - [ Groaning ] - We 're gonna be fine . I got you . - [ Door closes ] - Drive . [ Man ] Mr. Hellinger said wait over there . Gabriel McDow , welcome back into the fold . - It 's a trap ! - [ Mark ] Don 't ! [ Lucas ] Red ! Red ! - [ Screaming , shouting ] - Red ! Red ! Red ! Burn it all ! [ Mark ] Move ! Go ! Hellinger , freeze ! Down on the ground ! Face down ! Don 't move ! [ Mark ] Game over , Hellinger . Start talking . Simon Campos ! Does he work with you ? Is he here ? Tell me where he is ! [ Janis ] Damn it , Mark . You scared me . - Who do you work for ? - What ? You 're not FBI , so who the hell signs your paychecks ? CIA . - How long ? - Vogel recruited me at Quantico . Three years . How did you know ? I got suspicious when you sold out Marcie as the mole . Marcie has a brother . He 's dying in Missouri in a full-care facility . It 's expensive . The meetings with Vogel , the fish store where I assume you were meeting your contact . But it was the Hellinger sting confirmed everything . Your assignment today goes beyond being McDow 's decoy . How far beyond ? Intel says they 're planning to kidnap McDow en route to the safe house , so ... It 's our best chance to capture someone of value . Based on what intel , Janis ? There 's a lot of chatter . " There 's a lot of chatter ? " There is no chatter . We don 't even know where to listen . - Who 's your source ? - My source is reliable . You blew your cover by setting him up . Why now ? Because they wanted me to kill you , Mark . I told them I would . A lot of people are gonna be wondering who the hell you really are . I did what I had to do . Sacrifice for the greater good . I 've tried that line , it doesn 't work . - Looks good on a plaque , though . - Don 't say that to me , Mark . I 've been living in between two separate lives in this tiny space where nothing ever happens . I can 't have any friends . I can 't fall in love . Nobody even knows me . I was doing my job . That has to count for something . It does . Too bad all anyone will ever see is the deception . And they will never get past it . You 're on the outside now , Janis . If you sacrifice everything , be prepared to walk alone . You 're walking right beside me . You 're about to lose your family . Is it worth it to you ? - I don 't ask that question . - How can you not ? Too much at stake . Mark . Please don 't tell Demetri . Just let me do it . [ Janis ] It 's all over . I 'm glad to be out from under all that lying . I don 't understand how you could do this . I thought I could get away clean and not hurt anybody . What about the pregnancy ? - How does that not involve me ? - Demetri , I just ... I needed a way out . I thought it would be a new beginning . I 'm sorry . You 're my friend and I should have done better by you , but this baby is the most important thing that has ever happened to me . But it didn 't just happen to you . Every little decision you make leads to something else , and now we 're all connected , you and me and Zoey . No , we 're not . Demetri , there 's me and my baby , and then there 's you and Zoey . Don 't let this situation ruin your life . You don 't need to be part of the mess that I made . Yeah , well ... I already am . [ Man ] Meanwhile in the ready room of the American Eagle Squadron , Yank , Doodle and Dee watch while Dan tries to contact Roger Ramjet . [ High-pitched voice ] Roger should have located the No-Goods ' hideout by now . - Then why can 't we reach him on ... - [ Demetri ] Hey , Gabriel . - Agent Noh . - Yeah , I know . - Mind if I sit ? - Take a seat . - Sure . Take a seat . - Roger Ramjet . - Yeah , Dr. Evilkisser . - I love this show . - Yeah , me too . Dr. Evilkisser . - Evilkisser . Yeah . - [ Chuckling ] - Yeah . Yeah . [ Man ] ... chief of the army 's Counter Bad Guy division ... - Can I ask you a question ? - Yeah , yeah . Sure . In all the futures you saw was I in any of them ? No . You died . People ... people were sad . Very sad . What do you think happens when the future you saw changes ? Yeah , you know , that 's not possible . It 's not possible . It 's like ... It 's like trying to find a different path , you wind up in the same place . Always . Always in the same place . Like fate . Fate ! Like Lloyd and Olivia . Everyone is ending up where they 're supposed to be . Even you . - Makes sense . - Yeah . The No-Goods will take over . Now , what 's your plan ? I plan to find that diabolical machine before it 's too late . Then hurry . [ Speaking foreign language ] Wait here . Wait here . [ Speaks foreign language ] Oh , my God . [ Panting ] This is it . We 're here . I 'll always find you , kiddo . It 's OK . We made it . No . Janis , relax . Relax . I need your help .

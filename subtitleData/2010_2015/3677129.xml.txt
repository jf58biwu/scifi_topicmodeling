Mark , I just hope that you know you can still count on me . I never doubted that . W I gotta deal with vice president clemente . In my vision , it was clear that Jericho had done some things that threatened our national security . You got military clearance . As soon as you can document what Tracy knows , I want it uploaded . As of this moment , the world thinks you and simcoe accidentally caused this blackout . What happens if they find out you were awake while it happened ? ( Mark ) Simon campos has disappeared . ( Wedeck ) He took the damn ri . Did you overhear anything ? They said he 's going to cause another blackout . On October 6th , the planet blacked out for 2 minutes and 17 seconds , and the whole world saw the future . Some of us were alarmed by what we saw . Others were elated and rejoiced . Still others saw nothing at all . They were left confused , concerned and otherwise certain . But that uncertainty will soon be resolved . Tomorrow is d-day--the day we catch up to the flash-forwards . Our future bh as individuals and as a collective is upon us . This building may very well me under attack tomorrow night . But we will not back down . We are the FBI , and we will be open for business . That said , the director is instituting high maximum alert protocols and procedures . Agents benford and noh will be coordinating s.W.A.T. And sniper teams to provide external security and support . Vreede , Hawk , will be briefing supervisors on additional o.P.S. Plans . We are in uncharted waters , people . But we will get through this ... Together . That 's all . ( Indistinct conversations ) Mark . Walk with me . Simon campos ? His photo 's out to all local and national agencies . His cell phone ? So far , inactive . What about his sister ? She 's back with the family in Toronto . Maybe he 'll try and contact her . R.C.M.P. Is sitting on the house . We also have a trap and trace on their phones . He 's gone underground and taken that q.E.D. Ring with him . I want him back here immediately . We 're on it . Gentlemen , this is turning into one hell of a day . ( Man ) Once again , We have . breaking news out of Los Angeles . ( Wedeck ) What is this ? Wikr has just obtained footage of what appears to be a man who was awake during the global blackout . I gave strict orders for this to be kept under wraps . Who released this ? Wait a minute . Wait a minute . This isn 't us . Authorities are still trying to identify the man , b ... It 's a different angle . ... The footage was taken from a security camera ... ( Vogel ) He 's right . No one 's seen this on our end . Well , where did it come from ? The better question is , why now ? With April 29th only one day away , the stunned world wonders , who is this man , and why was he awake ? ( Imitating American accent ) Hi . My name 's David Walker . David Walker . David Walker .

Although technically he 's dead , he 's--he 's still my friend . So all of these people were together , and they 're all connected by the experiment ?

We don 't even know where to listen . Who 's your source ? My source is reliable . You blew your cover by setting him up . Why now ? Because they wanted me to kill you , mark . I told them I would . A lot of people are gonna be wondering who the hell you really are . I did what I had to do . " Sacrifice for the greater good . " I 've tried that line . It doesn 't work . Looks good on a plaque , though . Don 't say that to me , mark . I 've been living in between two separate lives in this tiny space where nothing ever happens . I can 't have any friends . I can 't fall in love . Nobody even knows me . I was doing my job . That has to count for something . It does . Too bad all anyone will ever see is the deception , and they will never get past it . You 're on thoutside now , Janis . If you sacrifice everything , be prepared to walk alone . You 're walking right beside me . You 're about to lose your family . Is it worth it to you ? I don 't ask that question . How can you not ? Too much at stake . Mark . Please don 't tell demetr just let me do it . It 's all over . I 'm glad to be out from under all that lying . I thought I could get away clean and not hurt anybody.This. What about the pregnancy ? How does that not involve me ? Demetri , I just ... needed a way out . I thought it would be a new beginning . I 'm sorry . You 're my friend , and I should have done better by you . But this baby is the most important thing that has ever happened to me . It didn 't just happen to you . Every little decision you make leads to something else , and now we 're all connected- - you and me and Zoey . No , we 're not . Demetri , there 's me and my baby , and then there 's you and Zoey . Don 't let this situation ruin your life . You don 't need to be part of the mess that I made . Yeah , well ... I already am .

People--people were sad . Very sad . ( Crunching ) What do you think happens when the future you saw changes ? Yeah , y-you know , that--that 'sot possible . It 's not possible . It 's like trying to find a different path . You wind up in the same place always- - always in the same place- - like fate . Fate . Like lloyd and Olivia .

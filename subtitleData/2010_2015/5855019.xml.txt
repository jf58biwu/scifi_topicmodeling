 Previously on Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D ... I was killed . Well , almost . Afterwards , it 's kind of a blank . Not everyone gets sent to Tahiti . It 's a magical place . He really doesn 't know , does he ? He can never know . What is Centipede ? It 's an intravenous filter for his blood . Those soldiers at the warehouse were forced to attack us ? Through that eye thing ? When the tide turned in our favor , Centipede flipped Hayward 's kill switch . Don 't do ... Po 's the strategist , Rama 's their recruiter . Perhaps this Clairvoyant 's the money . - Why do they want you ? - They took Coulson . Take care of my boy ! Mike ! We want you to tell us about the day after you died . 100 % premium-grade Chitauri metal . As rare as it gets . How 'd you get your hands on this , Vanchat ? It 's what I do . Find alien scrap no one else can , then offer it to people who fully appreciate my efforts . Hmm . I appreciate the hell out of them . You can name your price . Is that a Roomba ? Fitz-Simmons , he 's heading your way . We 've never done anything like this before . Are you sure ? It 's time , Simmons . Embrace the change . Skye . You 're up . Here . Let me get that for you . Mr. Vanchat . We were hoping you could help us find a friend . Impressive . You actually managed to reopen all your stitches . I just hope Vanchat can lead us to Centipede . Well , the Chitauri metal he was selling is an exact match to what Centipede used for their device . We find Centipede , we find Coulson . Don 't ask questions , Agent Kob . Just get me the 5-millimeter injector . That 's an order . Yes , sir . Honestly , how many agents do they think they can cram on this plane ? It 's only gonna get more crowded . We 're set to pick up more men when Agent Hand dumps Vanchat off at the Fridge . Honestly , I think it 's good they 're here . We need fresh eyes . It 's been 36 hours since Agent Coulson was taken and none of us have gotten any rest . Oh , joy . Agent Hand is giving another briefing . There was one fatality . The burned remains recovered at the site are believed to be those of Agent Trainee Michael Peterson . Other physical evidence has proven scarce . Nothing relating to Mr. Po , his Centipede associates , or their location has been found . - Any progress with Vanchat ? - Nothing actionable , Agent Ward . But I have my best interrogator in there right now . Vanchat will talk , and rest assured , when he does , not a single stone will be left unturned until we take down Centipede . - And find Agent Coulson . - And get Coulson back . We have a security breach . Someone 's hacking the system . Just in time . - Can you override this ? - What do you think you 're doing ? The money trail 's our key to finding Coulson . I just need to gain access to Vanchat 's financials , and from there , I should be able to trace Centipede 's payments and then hack into their account . You 're the consultant , the one who shot Agent Sitwell . Technically , that wasn 't me . I want you off this plane immediately . What ? Wait . I know I 'm not some badass field agent like May or Ward , but this is what I do . You can 't just kick me off this mission . Listen , I 'll do whatever you say . All this protocol crap doesn 't matter to me . All that matters to me is Coulson . Well , all this " protocol crap " matters to me . You 're a distraction . And you 're gone . Agent Hand . I know Skye 's methods are unorthodox . But she 's a member of this team . She can help . Agent May , your professional opinion . Will this girl be of any use to us on this plane ? No . Increase her restriction level , confiscate her laptop and phone . - Then have her delivered to debrief . - Yes , ma 'am . I 'll do it . I 'm her S.O. It 's clear that May has an ax to grind with me , but that was way out of line . No one knows what 's in May 's head except May . Don 't worry . Coulson will make this right when he gets back . I can find him , Ward . I believe you . I 've seen firsthand what you can do , even without S.H.I.E.L.D. resources . - Hang on . Hang on . - We have something for you . You made me a sandwich ? Yes , it is that . It 's a satellite phone . Damper-resistant . You get one shot before your bracelet shuts it down . So only call in case of emergency . What do I even need this for ? I 'm gonna be spending the next three days in a S.H.I.E.L.D. broom closet getting debriefed . That 's right . A few agents are coming here to pick you up for debriefing in exactly 12 minutes . Good luck . Don 't touch Lola . Mmm . Can you feel that ? Don 't stop . Listen to him . Who ordered this ? it seems you passed out . Now maybe you 're ready to share what memories you 're seeing . I saw Jordan hitting that game-winner over Russell in the ' 98 finals . - So clutch . - Agent Coulson . We 're gonna turn the machine back on and open your mind . It 's time to stop fighting it . If you don 't , you won 't survive the process . I 'll let you kill me before I give you anything . It seems you have a taste for that anyway . Murdered Mike Peterson in front of his own son ... Mr. Peterson chose that end . We gave him his life and his child , unscathed . You 're upset because that man 's death hits so close to home . Seeing a boy lose his father at such a young age , as you did . A defining moment . The Clairvoyant saw that . I hate to break it to you , but your telepathic friend is a fraud . Otherwise , he 'd know all these answers , and I wouldn 't be here . It 's true , this is strange . My friend can see that you died . You went cold . Your heart was torn to pieces . What The Clairvoyant can 't see is what happened after . How they brought you back from the dead . For some reason , Agent Coulson , you 're different . Now , why is that ? So , we have to do this the hard way . Just need an exploit . Some way in . Come on ! What ? What 's going on ? Weird . I think it 's the wireless . Here 's your change , sir . Uh , thank you . Hey , Lloyd . You might be my way in . - That 's what I said . Yeah . - One second . Of course , I love truffles . But not on that . What an idiot . So fax me over that stuff . No , sweetie , listen to me . It was a private jet . Of course there was Wi-Fi . He should have at least texted you back . No ! That 's too much . I know the Night-Night rounds no longer affect the Centipede Soldiers , but all we want to do is disable them , not kill them . I 'm good with either , frankly . Fitz , you don 't mean that . Those soldiers are just men ... Who can smash your skull open with a single punch . But they 're being controlled . Centipede is making them fight against their will . Well , they took Coulson . I don 't care what we have to do to get him back . We need to bring him home . What 's this guy doing ? Lulling Vanchat to sleep ? I 'm going in . Damn it . Okay , Skye . You just need a Plan B. Roadside Assistance . We see you 've had an accident . Yeah . Can you send somebody to tow me back to my house ? Of course , I 'll dispatch someone right away . Are you okay ? Yeah . I 'm good . Agent Hand needs you . Says it 's urgent . Time to talk . The names of all your buyers . Alphabetically would help . I 'm not telling you a bloody thing . That 's how you wanna play it ? Rochambeau you ? Rochambeau . Scissors ? Oh , Fitz ! I 've got all day . Whoa ! All right ! All right , I 'll talk ! I 'll talk ! The town that the bomb forgot . It was built in the ' 40s for nuclear testing . But when the Cold War ended , the town was spared . Not exactly prime real estate . Hmm . True . There 's nothing but desert for hundreds of miles . But I really like it . It 's nice here . The children are always playing , yet never make a sound . Shall we get back to it , then ? So you sure you don 't want me to take it to the dealer ? No , thanks . I got a guy . All right . Thank you . Dollar bills , y 'all . Lloyd Rathman 's office . This is the LAPD . I need to speak with Mr. Rathman . We recovered a stolen vehicle registered in his name . - Oh ! Was it damaged ? - Yes , ma 'am . We have two officers waiting at his home ready to take a statement . How long do you think it 'll take Mr. Rathman to get there ? You 're in a lot of trouble , Mr. Rathman . Who the hell are you ? Agent Melinda May , with S.H.I.E.L.D. Look , clearly there 's been a misunderstanding . I 'm a legitimate businessman . S.H.I.E.L.D. has evidence your company has been siphoning funds into an offshore account for some very bad people . My client 's business is their business . Well , my business is catching those guys . If it turns out you 've made profit from just one of them , S.H.I.E.L.D. is prepared to freeze all of your assets . I 'm calling my lawyer . Do that , and my offer 's off the table . - What offer 's that ? - Immunity . You walk . Free and clear . S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn 't touch a single asset . Not even your party boat in Key Largo . And if I say no ? You spend five years in the Fridge . - The " Fridge " ? - It 's worse than it sounds . All right . What do you want ? Follow me to your office . We 've got some work to do . Vanchat 's intel is paying off . We 're pursuing every known buyer of Chitauri metals around the globe . The largest is a warehouse in Sydney . We 're heading there now . This is our chance to take down Centipede . I want everyone in full tactical . And what about Agent Coulson ? If we 're lucky , Centipede 's holding him in Sydney . Dismissed . Agent Ward , a moment . First your friend Skye left the plane and never arrived for her debrief , then Vanchat almost flies out of the interrogation room . Do we have a problem ? No , Agent Hand . Your man wasn 't getting answers , so I stepped in . Without my permission . Well , congratulations . Thanks to you and your unique interrogation skills , we now have active strike teams running raids all over the world . The question is , why ? - Excuse me ? - It 's unprecedented , this kind of response for a Level 8 operative . The sheer manpower involved . I 've been on the phone all day . Director Fury . Commander Hill . Everyone wants an update . Frankly , I don 't understand it . No single agent is that important . Coulson is . S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s gonna find me before you break me . S.H.I.E.L.D. ? The Clairvoyant sees an end to all that . He doesn 't look so good . Raina . What took you so long ? I was tending to our other subject . The persuasion skills I 've spoken to The Clairvoyant so much about would be better served here , with me , breaking this man . I would never use force to bend a man to my wishes . He 's being difficult . - He 's being beaten . - Into submission . The Clairvoyant requested it and will tell me to ... See ? Yes . No . Well , I 've only just begun . My methods are sound , I assure you . Right here ? Yes . The Clairvoyant would like to speak to you . This is Raina . Yes . I agree . Thank you . I 'll put him back on . Yes , I 'm here . There a problem ? Victoria Hand . We don 't exactly see eye to eye . I 'm sure she 's utilizing all of S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s resources to find Coulson . Not all of them . You know , it wouldn 't hurt to have Skye working an exploit . Why didn 't you stick up for her ? Excuse me ? She 's proven herself on multiple missions . She 's a part of this team . You let her get tossed . All I did was tell Hand the truth . Skye 's no use to us on this plane . - How can you say that ? - She 's not . Not with all these agents here . Over her shoulder , monitoring her every move . - You wanted her off the plane . - Outside the system . That 's how Skye works best . You don 't have to assume the worst of me . Agent May , change of plans . Sending new coordinates now . We found their helicopter at a laboratory outside the Mojave Desert . Copy that . Coordinates received . Hang on to something . You want me to hack into a Swiss bank account ? Just need you to type in your private corporate ID to get me in the door . Yeah , well , letting you in that door is a crime . Come to think of it , how do I know you 're not just some criminal ? In my experience , a Federal agent shows a badge . You want to see my badge ? S.H.I.E.L.D. protocol Six Alpha Victor . There . That 's my badge . Great . I just got my high score in Tiny Wings . S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s been watching you for quite some time , Mr. Rathman . You 're a prime exploit . The gambling , the divorces , that money pit in the Caymans . You 're even behind on your child support payments . Ugh , that 's a clerical thing . My ex knows that . But did David know that ? David thinks I 'm a cool dad . David thinks you 're a jackass . You gotta fix that , Lloyd . Kids need someone they can look up to . Now start typing . P.D. Security ! Don 't move ! That 's it . Nice and easy . Keep your hands where I can see ' em . On the ground ! Okay , I 'm typing . I 'm typing . You S.H.I.E.L.D. guys don 't mess around . This is turning into an interesting day , isn 't it ? So you 're my friend now ? 'Cause I 've seen what you do to your friends . - Mr. Po ? - Yeah . He was a murderer . Incapable of remorse . I was thinking of Mike Peterson , Chan Ho Yin . I gave them what they asked for . Mike wanted to be a hero to his son . Now he is . Did Akela Amador want a bomb in her head ? The people you work for are just as capable of using cruel means to reach a justified end . And who do you work for , Raina ? The Clairvoyant ? Yes . - Who is he ? - I don 't know . Today was the first time I personally made contact . My heart 's still racing . He has you building super-soldiers . The Clairvoyant gives us guidance . Formulas . For what ? The changing world . The world your organization brought upon us . We 're new to the business of what you 've been doing for decades . So , now what ? You have soldiers . You can make them strong . You can control them . In an instant , you can kill them . Yes , but we can 't bring them back to life . You were killed . Now you 're here . We want to know how . Don " [ you ? I 'd like to turn the machine on again . It induces theta brain wave frequencies to help uncover the secrets buried in the subconscious . If you cooperate , you can surf those waves . I 've gone surfing . That is definitely not like surfing . You 've been resisting . Fight the waves , and you 'll drown . Your brain will cook . You 'll stop breathing , again . Then that 's what it 'll be . Or I hold out until my team comes to find me . Either way , you will not get classified intel from me . I 'm not interested in those secrets . The Clairvoyant can see within any agency , any government . He knows what the President dreams about at night . I want what you want , to uncover a different secret . The secret S.H.I.E.L.D. is keeping from you . All right , we 're logged in . But you do realize you can 't transfer these kinds of funds online ? I 'm not looking to transfer funds , I 'm looking for transaction records . Go to your account history . We need to open up a terminal emulator , see what kind of encryption they 've got . If it 's an SSL 256 , or an AES twofish-serpent , we 're in business . - Yeah . - Quantum key , that 's another story . Right . Lloyd . What is happening here ? Yeah , account history , where is that ? Delete that second line . Press " return . " See , the thing is , I have an assistant that does all this for me . That 's it . So , this Vanchat , is this the guy you 're trying to bust ? No , we already have him in custody . What I wanna know is who 's recently paid Vanchat a lot of money . I backtrack those payments to the buyer 's account and get a record of all the purchases she 's made . Maybe use it to track her down . Click there . Hello , Raina . Let 's see what you 've been up to . Print that . Great . So are we done here ? One last thing . And you 're clinging to the one thing you have , fond memories of your recovery . So this person you work for told you I died and have gaps in my memory ? Ever think your mind reader might just be looking up symptoms online ? I was also told it keeps you up at night , that you crave answers , that you 're troubled by the fact that when you asked for answers , you were denied . Isn 't that true ? I trust the system . They keep secrets for a reason . But why would S.H.I.E.L.D. keep details of your death from you ? They 're your family . Your only family , since you 've lost your mother , too . Now , after all you 've sacrificed ... Sacrifice is part of the job . I would give my life ... You didn 't just give your life . You gave up your chance at a normal one . At love . And she did love you , Agent Coulson . - How could you know that ? - Do you miss her ? Dinners at The Richmond ? Do you miss hearing her play ? You didn 't even have a chance to say goodbye . I couldn 't . I can 't . She cried for days after S.H.I.E.L.D. told her you died . They shattered her heart With a lie . - And now they 're lying to you . - No . No , they 're not . I know you don 't wanna believe it . But you can 't tell me nothing makes you doubt , makes you wonder , what happened in Tahiti . It 's a magical ... I keep saying that . Don 't you wanna know why ? Turn it on . The Centipede soldiers each have a port on their delivery device to inject refills of serum . With this injector cuff , we can use the port to our advantage . By injecting a refined dose of dendrotoxin to incapacitate the soldier . - How 's it work ? - Oh . Just simply lock it around the Centipede soldier 's forearm . And night-night super powers . Sounds like riding a bull for eight seconds . - Yeah , exactly . It 's that simple . - Yeah . - Hello ? - Simmons . It 's me . Why , hello , Dr. Nugent . Is someone there ? Oh , God . Don 't try to lie . You are the worst at this . Remember our safe word . Manscaping ? Oh , I shouldn 't have said that . Um ... I am right as rain . Couldn 't be better , old chap . You three , out . Listen up . I may have a lead on where Centipede 's holding Coulson . Skye ? What have you found ? We 're about to launch a major assault on a Centipede lab , and you wanna take your team to the desert based on a hunch from Skye ? It 's not a hunch . Skye followed the money from Vanchat back to Centipede . Turns out , they recently purchased a small development less than 100 miles from here . Well , that 's great news for their real estate portfolio . But we have confirmed activity at the lab . I 'm taking a strike team to investigate . End of story . So we split up . You take the strike team and go after Centipede . We 'll investigate Skye 's lead , see if Coulson 's there . You backed my decision to kick Skye off the plane . - Seems like it worked out . - Seems like you played me . Look , this isn 't personal . But I am taking my team and we 're gonna find Coulson . Send back-up if you want . What makes you so sure this machine will even work ? It worked on me . One thing before we start . What is it with the flowers ? Who doesn 't like flowers ? I 'm glad you noticed . Close your eyes and relax . I want you to think back to your first memory after you died . What do you see ? Sandy beach , blue waves . Just as I remember it . Focus on the details . Can you feel that ? Don 't stop . Listen to him ! Who ordered this ? - What ? - Director Fury himself . Got creepy ? You shouldn 't be here . There 's nowhere to run ! Agent Coulson . Somethings happening , isn 't it ? Listen to him ! I need you to look at your surroundings . Try and describe what you see . Are you still in Tahiti ? Tell me . It 's dark . There 's nothing . Everything is dark . Coulson 's gotta be here somewhere . We need to split up . Or run . - I 'll take care of him . - Are you sure ? I got this . Come on , let 's move ! Coulson ! Now , Coulson . Where the hell are you ? He 's drifting . He 's drifting . He 's drifting . This is wrong . Can you feel that ? - Don 't ! - Listen to him ! - Stop ! - Who ordered this ? - Director Fury himself . - This is wrong ! Listen to him ! Let me die , please . Please . Please , I 'm begging you , let me die . Please . Please let me die . Let me die , please ! Please ! Let me die ! Please ! Let me die ! Stop fighting it , Agent Coulson . Stop fighting it . Please let me die . It 's for his own good . Please let me die ! Please let me die ! Please let me die . Let me die . Let me die , please . Coulson . Coulson . Come back . Come back . Come back . Come back . Skye ? Skye ... Skye . Nice jacket . Bet there aren 't any flower dresses where she 's going . Amen to that , sister . Dismissed . Let 's go , ma 'am . Just got off the phone with headquarters . Director Fury was very relieved . I understand you 've been busy . Heard you put some miles on my plane . The manhunt has yielded some impressive results . Centipede operations have been taken down around the globe . - Any word on The Clairvoyant ? - Nothing yet . But it 's going to be awfully hard to stay hidden now that The Clairvoyant 's on S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s radar . Good . Because Raina knew things about me . Personal things . I want to know how . My men and I are taking her straight to headquarters for questioning . We 'll be in touch . Agent Hand ? Thank you , for everything . Good to have you back . Honestly , this bus isn 't really my style . I just want to say thank you . Now get back to work . I heard what you did for me . I think it 's time that we remove this . Disengage bracelet . Are you kidding me ? Thought you 'd like that . Back in that room . Did they learn anything ? No . Did you ? I heard what you were saying . It wasn 't real . They were just messing with my head . But I appreciate your concern . Evening , Doctor . Agent Coulson . You weren 't operating on my heart . - I know about Tahiti . - I was afraid this day would come . - Because of what I 'd do ? - Because of what I 've done . After New York , you weren 't dead for eight seconds , or 40 seconds , or whatever they put in your file . You were dead for days . - That 's impossible . - It should be . But Director Fury moved heaven and earth . He had a team of scientists working around the clock , using procedures that no good doctor would ever allow . You were there . Fury brought me in during the seventh operation . We kept you conscious to monitor brain activity , but you were in extreme pain . The neurological damage , it was catastrophic . - I wanted to die . - And we should have let you . The trauma you 'd endured was ungodly . Why was that machine messing with my brain ? After what you 'd been through , we wanted to restore the man you 'd once been . So we gave you a pleasant memory . Of a beautiful island . We didn 't want you to be that thing . What had I become , Doctor ? Tell me . You 'd lost your will to live . We tried to give it back . I 'm sorry , Agent Coulson . Truly I am . If you only knew ... Hello ? Anybody there ? Hello ? No !

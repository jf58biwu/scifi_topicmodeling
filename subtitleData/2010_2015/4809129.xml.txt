 Battleship [ 2012 ] Blu-ray [ HI ] = = sync , corrected by elderman = = Today really marks the first stage ... of an unprecedented technological advancement . We have begun to identify so-called Goldilocks planets . These are planets that share a similar relationship with their sun ... as we have with ours . If a planet 's too far away from its sun , it 's too cold . If it 's too close to its sun , it 's too hot . But for an Earth-like planet , the distance is just right . Potentially perfect for sustaining life . We have finally managed to identify one planet ... that is the right distance from its star to hold water ... and is the right mass to sustain an atmosphere . Every 24 hours , our station in Hawaii ... will transmit a signal to Landsat 7 , our deep-orbiting satellite , which will amplify and relay the signal to our targeted planet , which is rather grandly entitled Planet G. If there is intelligent life out there and they come here , it 's gonna be like Columbus and the Indians . Only we 're the Indians . Ladies and gentlemen , please prepare to bear witness ... to the making of history . Start transmission . Well , it seems as though NASA is setting up shop ... right here in our own backyard . Today the Beacon International Project was launched . Satellite dishes here on Oahu ... sending out very powerful signals into deep space ... with an attempt to communicate with anyone- - Another round , birthday boy . that might be out there listening .

" Adversity is the state ... in which man most easily becomes acquainted with himself , being especially free of admirers then .

Great . All right . Happy birthday . Blow out your candle and , uh , make a wish . Do not waste a wish on a girl . Wish for a job , an apartment , a new alternator belt so I don 't have to drive you everywhere , a job , or a- - You said " job " twice . It 's my birthday and my wish . All right ?

Oh , my God . As from now , as from right this second , there 's a new dynamic at play . And this dynamic is the following . From here on , till I state otherwise , there will be no more debate , no more discussion , no more compromise ! It 's me speaking , you listening . Me saying , you doing . Do you understand that ? It 's time for a new course of action . A new direction . A game change . You 're joining me in the navy . Live , local , this is Hawaii News Now . Thousands of sailors on dozens of ships ... are coming to Hawaii for RIMPAC . RIMPAC is the world 's largest multinational maritime exercise . RIMPAC is a military ballet of 14 navies- - 20,000 navy personnel- - Cooperation and collaboration amongst the countries is the goal . Relationship-building is the key . Not all the action is taking place on the water . There will also be sporting events here on land . - Forget World Cup . - This is the RIMPAC Cup final . It 's another beautiful day here in Hawaii , as usual . Indeed it is , but a storm is brewing on the field ... - as the scrappy U.S.A. team is butting heads with Japan . The score is 2-nil , Japan . Now , the U.S. has been trailing all day . Team leader Alex Hopper has got to do something to rally the troops here . Turn it up ! Big save ! Great save ! Big save ! Stone Hopper , he 's answered every test today ! What 's wrong with you , drama queen ? Get up , princess ! Come on ! U.S.A. ' s Ordy squares the ball over to number 6 , Alan . Clever backheel into space . Hopper . Goal ! Yeah ! Yeah ! A missile past Iwashiro . Whoo ! The U.S. is finally on the board , showing some signs of life , with the score 2-1 , Japan . We are now into stoppage time . Can the U.S. tie it up ? Time ! Time , time , time ! One minute left . Hey , Alex ! It 's coming your way ! Stone Hopper has placed it perfectly . It takes a fortuitous bounce . Hopper is underneath it and on-side . Hey , ref ! A penalty kick has been awarded to the United States ! Nagata made contact with Hopper inside the box . And by " contact , " you mean Nagata kicked him in the face . You all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Stone Hopper has come up the field . I 'm fine . I don 't need your help . I don 't need- - Bronson 's gonna take it . Bronson ! He 's gonna take it . - What do you mean , Bronson ? No . Negative . I 'm fine . - Bronson , take this . - Bronson , don 't move . - Bronson , come here . Bronson , you move one more step , you 're dead ! Do you want to die today ? Do you want to die ? Good choice . He 's definitely concussed . I 've got it under control . You just threatened one of my sailors . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's gonna be his little brother , Alex Hopper . If I was Stone , I would have picked another shooter . - I 'm skeptical that Hopper is a hundred percent . - Engage . Engage . Impose will . Impose will . There are two kinds of idiots , Hopper . One looks where he kicks . The other looks where he doesn 't kick . Which idiot are you ? I 'm the idiot that 's going to kick it through your keeper 's face . Get ready for overtime . All eyes on Hopper . He could send this into overtime . And here we go ! If Hopper scores , the U.S. will go into overtime . Hopper sails one miles over the crossbar , nowhere near the goal ! - Typical . - What a heartbreak for the U.S. It was a very poor attempt ... by the obviously injured Alex Hopper . He refused to come out of the game , and his stubbornness cost the United States . Congratulations to Japan , our 2012 RIMPAC Cup winners . The final , as we sign off- - Japan , 2 , the United States , 1 . Are you ready for this ? Born . You sure ? Never been more sure of anything in my life . What are you gonna say ? I 'm gonna walk up to him , man to man , look him straight in the eyes . With what words ? My words . Okay . Sir , your daughter is the best thing that has ever happened to me . She 's smart , kind , beautiful , funny , and I 'm madly in love with her . It would be an honor ... to have your permission to marry her . I love you . I love you too . ♪ Together we could walk to the river , stand with the finest ♪ ♪ Move to the sounds of the band from Atlantis ♪ ♪ One lovely day ♪ ♪ One lovely day ♪ First off , I 'd like to welcome you all ... to the RIMPAC International Naval War Games . And I 'd like to welcome you on board ... the greatest fighting ship in American naval history- - the Mighty Mo . The U.S.S. Missouri . Fought in World War II- - Shit . Hopper , your cover . Keeping you on your toes . Hopper , let 's go ! Come on ! Hopper ! This way . No . No . No . No . That way , sir . Yep . Yep . Knew that . I knew- - We knew that . You look good . The U.S.S. Missouri was the final battleship to be completed by the United States ... before being decommissioned and replaced with a more modern fleet of vessels ... like , uh , destroyers . What 's the difference between a battleship and a destroyer ? Well , battleships- - You see , battleships are great ships . But they 're kind of like dinosaurs . They 're designed to take hits , like a floating punching bag . But then there 's destroyers , which are just awesome . They 're designed to dish it out , like the Terminator . - Are you a captain ? - No , he 's not a captain ... because he 's always late . Come on . I fight the ship . Come on . Which is even better . And she remained a part of the reserve fleet- - Listen , get it done . Get it done . Babe , it 's a formality . I 'm all over it . Okay . Okay , go . We have with us today veterans from the Missouri ... who have served on her , some going back to World War II , examples of the finest men to have ever served in any navy . God bless . Thank you . Lieutenant Hopper , what an honor . Thank you for joining us . Good to be here . And now , as they prepare to embark on this outstanding exercise- - I 'm nervous . Shades off . I would like the commanding officers to come to the stage . Captain Nagata , Japan . Konnichiwa . Captain Lou , Malaysia . Allo . Allo . It 's so close to the way we say it . He hates me . He doesn 't hate you . Shut up . Shut up . - Captain Jacks , Australia . - G 'day . Shut up . Captain Sau , Singapore . G 'day . Shut ... up . G 'day . A special acknowledgment to Commander Stone Hopper , United States Navy- - That 's your call . Knock ' em out . who , along with his outstanding crew and ship , had the highest overall rating last year . Shades off , Hopper . Commander . Thank you , Admiral . Welcome , everybody . It 's really great to see all of you here today . Especially you , gentlemen . It 's a true honor . Me and my crew are gonna have to be on our toes this year , 'cause your ships look outstanding and your men look ready . So good luck out there . Be safe ... and keep charging . He loves his daughter . She loves you . He 's gonna respect that . Hey , Mike . - Admiral . - You remember Sam ? It 's an obsolete tradition , this asking for permission . Tell me where this came from . Sam 's a physical therapist now . Stop worrying about this and walk up and do what you got to do . Hello , Hopper . Why are you here ? Oh , this is gon ' be sweet . - I was within the rules . - Really ? Were you in the rules when you kicked me in the face ? Isn 't there something more important you should be doing right now ? He hates the man . That seems a bit juvenile , wouldn 't you say ? Go mess with him . See what happens . Why ? Do it . Would it be funny if I punched you in the face ? Stop it . Chicken . Kentucky Fried Chicken . Yeah . I love it . Two-piece meal . You look like Colonel Sanders , actually . He was a handsome man . Good job out there , Dad . What do you want ? Hopper needs five minutes of your time . That 's enough . Don 't you have something more important you should be doing right now ? Three minutes , tops . Thank you . I love you . Thank you , Daddy . I love you too . Thank you . He 's gonna smash my face in . He 's not gonna smash your face in . Oh , my God . Sir , it would be an honor . Sir . Sir . Sir . Give me your permission . It would be an honor to have your permission . Sir , give me your permission . What 's your deal ? It would be a thankful honor ... to have your permission ... to honor ... your hand . What ? Oh , my God . Sir , may I please marry your daughter ? She 's everything I have , and I love her . Talking to yourself , Mr. Hopper ? Yeah , I was . I was actually talking about you , Nagata . Mm-hmm . Let go . Let go ! What the- - Sir , it was a fluke accident . The bathroom floor was wet . I began to fall . Captain Nagata kindly reached out to help . Our heads go bang . We fall back . Bang again . Just like the great Jerry Lewis . - Jerry Lewis ? - Did he just say " Jerry Lewis " ? - Yes , sir . - Are you kidding me ? The Bellboy and ... original The Nutty Professor . - Very good movies . - He 's a great humanitarian , sir . You both think this is a joke , and you 're very much mistaken . This will not happen again . Do I make myself clear ? Yes , sir . Yes , sir . Gentlemen , give me a minute with Mr. Hopper here . What is wrong with you ? You 've got skills , but I have never ever .. seen a man waste them like you . " Keep the ship out of the surf and spray- - " " Or you will plunge to destruction . " Homer , sir . The fact that you know that infuriates me beyond words . What my daughter sees in you is a great mystery to me . You 're a very smart individual ... with very weak character , leadership ... and decision-making skills . Do you have anything to say to me ? Anything ? Negative , sir . Enjoy these naval exercises , Hopper . They 're likely to be your last . Dismissed . - Is there anything I can do to help ? - Negative . If you wanna talk about anything- - I don 't .

We 're gonna be close maneuvering with 13 nations out here . We are here to crush every other ship . I 'm excited to see what we learn . We are not here in this weapons room to learn . Be safe out there , look out for each other and keep charging . If we return to Pearl without having outperformed every other ship on that ocean- - Yo , Saunders .

I mean , seriously . Dr. Nogrady ? Lead with that next time . Okay , Danny ? You gotta start prioritizing your information . You gotta tell me 1-2-3 . You don 't start with " M. " You know what I mean ? I mean , I 'm not saying that you 're a boob . But this is , like , boobish behavior . Hi , Dr. Nogrady . Are you seeing what I 'm seeing ? The incoming tracks . Correct . Um , I 've got five distinct objects . Five distinct objects that are moving ... in formation . They 're locked in on my signal . They 're headed straight for me . Correct . Uh , maybe we should call NASA . NASA have called us . They 're on the phone right now . Good morning , Mr. Zapata . NASA ? We 're tracking something splintering off of the main group . That 's not splitting off . That thing is breaking apart . Has anyone called the Chinese ? Because this is no meteor . Yes , we 've checked . It 's not the Russians . It 's not the Chinese . Maybe we should call the air force , because they might want to fuel up their jets . The air force is online . It appears the event is headed your way . Prepare yourself . Uh , roger that . How would you suggest that I prepare myself , sir ? Brace . Let 's all be seated . I 'm hoping somebody here can explain this to me . Mr. Secretary , four of the five objects landed in the Pacific Ocean . The fifth one appeared to have broken apart , making significant contact with Hong Kong . But other places were also affected- - Scotland , Germany , France , even Iowa . So , what is it ? Well , sir , at this point we 're working on a couple of theories . - And you are who , sir ? - I 'm with NASA . Well , what is NASA present in this room for ? We 're looking at the very real possibility ... that this is legitimate extraterrestrial contact . It appears that it originated ... from Gliese 's solar system , home of Planet G. You 're saying that we sent out a signal , and we got back an alien response ? Sir , we just got word from Pearl . They believe whatever made impact with Hong Kong also made impact with the Pacific Ocean . Where in the Pacific ? Approximately 150 miles south of where we are right now , sir . It should be right there , but we 're not seeing anything . Get me the Sampson . Yes , sir . Base course 220 , speed 25 . Standard rudder , 220 . Aye , sir . Captain on the bridge ! As casualty reports come in , it 's still unclear exactly what it was that hit Hong Kong . It isn 't anything from this planet . How do we know that ? Because the Chinese have sampled it . It 's made of a material that doesn 't exist in the periodic table . It 's literally not of this Earth . The only element they 've been able to identify is lawrencium . Lawrencium ? Uh- - You gotta stop tapping . You 're tapping . You 're the loud one . Looking at the grid patterns , it 's something in the neighborhood of solar paneling , uh , communications paneling . It may be some kind of communication unit . Communications ? Who 's communicating what ? To who ? What the heck is that ? Bridge , starboard lookout . Got an unknown surface contact . Bearing is 232 true , approximately 8,000 yards . Sir ? Yeah ? - You may wanna come take a look at this . - I am looking at it . On the radar , sir . Something very peculiar . - That 's the John Paul Jones , right ? - Yes , sir . Myoko . Yes , sir , it is . Well , then why don 't I see- - see that ? Combat , Captain . I have a visual on the track bearing 237 on the horizon . What do you hold in that bearing ? Bridge , T.A.O. I 've got nothing at 237 . I 'm looking right at it , Mr. Hopper . Find me something . Scope . 237 . What do you got ? Stand by . That 's negative , sir . Scope 's clear . I got nothing . - Taylor , did you break this son of a bitch ? - No , sir . I didn 't do anything to it , sir . You know I 'll throw your ass off this ship . I know you will , sir . Got it , sir . On my camera . What is it ? I don 't know . Is this some kind of exercise ? Probably . Unknown vessel in vicinity of 15 degrees , 37 minutes north ... and 159 degrees , 33 minutes west . Request you establish communications with my vessel on V.H.F. channel 16 ... and identify yourself , over . John Paul Jones , this is Sampson , Charlie Oscar . John Paul Jones , Charlie Oscar .

The Myoko 's hit , sir ! - Are the weapons ready ? Sir , they 've killed everything that 's fired on them . Get the guns on line , or we ram this thing . They killed my brother and every man on his ship ! We have no weapons to attack with , sir . Then set course to 310 . - That 's a collision course ! Are you clear on that ? - 310 !

We can 't get in , and they can 't get out . The field , whatever it is , extends about 300,000 feet in altitude ... and has a depth of about two nautical miles . We are in contact with Admiral Shane of Pacific Fleet . But right now , our navy is effectively trapped outside the area . So we have nobody in there ? Well , sir , we have three guided missile destroyers still unaccounted for . So it 's conceivable we do have somebody inside . Well , who ? Okay . Thank you ! Captain ! Captain ! - My grandmother could climb this mountain . - It 's a start , Mick . What was that ? I 'm not sure . What the hell are you guys doing up here ? I need you off this mountain right now . - Wait . What 's going on ? Why ? - The island 's under attack . Attack ? By who ? I don 't know . People are using the word " alien . " Aliens ? We don 't know . Whatever it is took out the marine base , and all roads leading to this mountain have been destroyed . Cell phones , radios , Internet- - everything is shut down . The navy 's engaged just off of the coast . The navy ? I need you and your friend off of this mountain right now . Come on , let 's go . Vic , leave your car here . We 'll go block the road . Where are you going ? Mick ! Where are you going ? I ain 't never seen an alien . Have you ever seen an alien ? Mick ! Don 't leave me alone . Brah , you saw that ? What the hell was that ? Vince , did you see that ? Vince ] It looked like a jet . Brah , I 've never- - Sir , we need you . We need you now . I can 't . If you can 't , who can ? Captain . Where did we find it ? One of their transporters must have crashed on the way over to the island . There was debris everywhere . Thomas and Potts just fished him out of the water with a grappling hook . It was a bad idea , but they kept yanking . I kept telli " 'em no , and they kept- - Okay . Oh , shit . Damn ! Beast , flashlight . My dad said they 'd come . Said it my whole life . He said we ain 't alone . He said one day we 'd find them ... or they 'd find us . Know what else he said ? He said , " I hope I ain 't around when that day comes . " Not dead ! Not dead ! Not dead ! Not dead ! I got a bad feeling about this . What kind of bad feeling ? Like , " We 're going to need a new planet " kind of bad feeling . Officer ] Medical casualty , C53 . Two men down .

Let 's go . Get out of here ! No ! Yo ! Hey ! Raikes . Get your ass to C.I.C. Now ! Come on . Raikes , you better be there . Come on , come on , come on . Mahalo , mother- - We got to get off this mountain . The cop left the keys on his belt . You got to go down there and get ' em . You can do it . Now . Static ] This is an emergency call . Can anyone hear me ? Radio check . Can anyone hear me ? Over . - Hey , wait up ! Don 't leave ! Don 't leave ! - Stop right there ! - Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! - Who are you ? I 'm Cal Zapata . We sent out a beacon . Oh , shit ! Is he a cyborg ? Are you guys with them ? If he 's human , could you have him put the gun down ? - Just please put the- - - Mick , put your gun down . I mean , I told them that something like this could happen . I said it 's gonna be like Columbus and the Indians ... or the Conquistadors and the Incans . They just thought , " Oh , no , they 'll be sweet . " They killed my grad student ! Okay . Okay . Calm down . - I can 't . - Slow . Slow . Sit down . - I can 't breathe . - You 're fine . Slow breaths , slow breaths . - You 're freaking him out , Mick . - I doubt it takes much to freak him out . We need- - We need the marines . We need the army . We need all of them . It is the strong belief of the Chinese ... that what crashed into Hong Kong was some sort of communications ship . So you 're saying that a flying telephone cratered ... and took out 25,000 people ? What I 'm saying is that our visitors seem extraordinarily concerned ... with establishing a line of communication home . If they 've lost their communication ship , how could they do that ? The same way we did . Our communications station in Hawaii ... has the ability to send a message to deep space via the Landsat 7 satellite . I believe it 's for that asset they 've domed the islands . We 're looking at an extinction-level event . The most critical part of any military operation : establish communications , reinforcements , follow-on forces . You 're saying E.T. wants to phone home ? That would be incredibly , incredibly bad . I mean , so far , only five ships have made contact . If five ships can do this , what do you think 50 can do or 500 or 5,000 or 500,000 ? Sir , if I could just have a minute . Just give me one second . Why am I staring at a lizard ? Because this is Penelope the Third . - And ? - And they have the exact same eyes . You have 15 seconds . Go . Okay , sir . I-I-I put the helmet on , and the helmet is just basically extreme sunglasses . It 's just some hydration and some oxygen saturation ... and a bunch of other stuff I don 't understand . But we took Penelope to the beach one time , which was a terrible idea . She went absolutely crazy because she can 't handle the sunlight . You see ? And I don 't think that they can handle the sunlight either . You try anything else on ? N-Negative , sir . Just the helmet . Just the helmet . Scientists have confirmed that there was a U.F.O. landing ... in the Pacific Ocean , off the coast of Hawaii . Today , I wanted to update the American people ... on what we know about the situation in Hawaii . First , we are bringing all available resources to bear . The news has sparked global unrest as the populations panic , unleashing an unprecedented wave of chaos across the world . Many governments have declared martial law . Just scramble the jets , Admiral . We need to get in there ! I 'm far more aware than you of the need to get inside there ! But wasting lives will not help . You want me to send up another plane ? I 'll do it the second you come on up here ... and put your ass in the copilot 's seat , sir ! Are they transmitting ? Well , they could be , but it wouldn 't do them any good . There 's no satellite to receive the transmission . - We beam to Landsat 7 . - What 's Landsat 7 ? It 's our deep-space satellite . It only orbits into range once every 24 hours . - When is the satellite in position ? - 8 : 43 a.m. Got about five hours , and then they 'll use it to slingshot their transmission . - Slingshot where ? - I don 't know . Wherever it is they 're from . Pearl Harbor here . We 're approximately here . And they , whatever they are , are somewhere in the middle . We 're trapped out here . What we know right now ... is we can 't target them unless we have a plain line of sight . Without radar , we have no way to track them , correct ? Correct . But I don 't think they can see us either . - Why ? - Because we are still alive . Okay , so they can 't see us , and we can 't see them , and we have no way to hit them from a safe distance . There is a way . - A way ? - A way of seeing them ... without seeing them . You 're going to reference Art of War right now , aren 't you ? What are we supposed to do , fight the enemy where they aren 't , move like water ? 'Cause I 've read that thing , like , six times . It makes no sense . That book is Chinese . Still makes no sense . My way is much more simple . We 've been doing it to America for 20 years . Water displacement . How do you track water displacement ? - Tsunami buoys . - Tsunami buoys ? You have them surrounding your islands , transmitting displacement data . We hack into their transmissions , form a grid . - You can 't track anything without radar . - I don 't need radar . Just the radio frequencies . Turn off Aegis radar , please . Who is this guy ? Chief Moore . Sir . - Secure SPY . - Securing SPY , sir . Display NOAA data . NOAA data ? That 's correct . You heard him . Display NOAA data . - What the hell is that ? - It 's a buoy . If it gets hit by a wave , it transmits a signal . Bring up chart plot . Chart plot . Bring it up . So we can track without radar . We would practice it as a contingency plan . You dirty , cheating , sneaky- - Rough world . I like it . Captain . My chair is your chair , sir . Brother would have done the same . I wish we could get ahold of Hopper . Who 's Hopper ? He 's a tactical actions officer ... on an Arleigh Burke class destroyer . It has the resources that could take this entire mountain out . Well , great . That makes a lot of sense . Let 's call him . We can 't . Everything is jammed . They 're using an electromagnetic field to block our signals . It 's more like a pulse . It 's not a brick wall . There 's gaps , okay ? From inside the barrier , we might just be able to get a call out . If I could get to my spectrum analyzer , then theoretically we could find a frequency that we could broadcast on- - Do you have a piece of equipment that can make a call ? - Yeah . - Get it . Well , I can 't , because it 's down there , in that nest of aliens . - You 're gonna go get it . - No . - Yes . - Yes . We are looking for patterns of water displacement . That buoy 's underwater . That 's a ship . - Get on your gun . - Sir . Target , Echo-1-1 . Roger . Echo-1-1 . Ready to fire . When we fire , they will know where we are . Fire ! - Ordy , anything ? - Negative , sir . It 's a miss . It 's heading towards us . You ready ? I 'm sorry , but there is no possible way that I 'm going down there . I- - I do not possess that kind of courage . Right now , you 're gonna acquire that courage , or I 'm gonna break my steel leg off into your ass . You feel me ? I feel you . Go . Now . Acquiring courage . Acquiring courage . What ? - Foxtrot-2-4 . - Foxtrot-2-4 . - Ready to fire . - Fire ! - Ordy , anything ? - Negative , sir . It 's a stupid , nincompoop idea . There 's another one . Incoming , incoming ! Sir , they 're coming from both directions ! Range reports incoming . Engines , back full . Whoa . Incoming , incoming , incoming ! - India-3-7 . - India-3-7 . Loaded . - Second coordinates , Romeo-2-6 . - Romeo-2-6 . Sir , we 're hot over here . Missiles good to go . Let 's light ' em up , Captain Nagata . Captain Nagata . Fire ! Holy shit ! Hit , sir ! Hit ! - Yeah ! - Yeah ! Any station this net , any station this net . This is a call for help . Any warship , police or military personnel , please respond . Over . This is U.S.S. John Paul Jones . - State your identity and position . Over . - Hopper ? Hopper ? Sam ? Sam , are you okay ? Where are you ? - Oh , thank God . I 'm okay . - Static ] Listen , they 're here at the satellite array at Saddle Ridge . Do you copy ? They 're going to transmit a signal and establish communication . You need to destroy the facility . - We have four hours . - Four hours . I copy . Hopper . Can you hear me ? Babe , you need to get out of there . Hopper ? Hopper ? No , they 're gone . They 're gone . We 'd better get gone too . I 'm thinking an Arleigh Burke class destroyer ... is about to rain hell down on this mountaintop . Are you ready to kill another one ? - Tango-1-9 . - Tango-1-9 . Loaded . - Whiskey-2-5 . - Whiskey-2-5 . Raikes , can you get a track on their ship ? Negative , sir . It 's moving all over the place . I can 't get a line on it . Sucker 's really jumping around . Very intelligent . What time is sunrise ? Forty minutes , sir . Let 's take these bastards somewhere they don 't want to go . General quarters . General quarters . - All hands , man your battle stations . I need to know when we round this point if we can hold her tight . Right around Diamond Head , here . There 's a brutal current there . It 'll take a miracle to keep her off the reef . Ordy , is it possible ? Can you do it ? It 's not impossible . - Sir , I can try , but I don 't know what- - - Can you do it ? Yes or no ? Contact is seven miles out and closing fast . Yes , sir . I can do it . Check safe . Check clear . - Check safe . Check clear . - Get some ! - Captain Nagata , how good is your aim ? - Excellent . All right . Let 's start this turn ! Aye , sir ! - Left , hard rudder ! - Left , hard rudder . Aye , sir ! Charts , how we looking ? It 's all reef . - Ordy , you 're way too close ! Come left ! Come left ! - Easy . Come left ! We 're about to kiss these rocks , Ordy ! Ordy ! Where did you learn to shoot ? I 'm not sure how you say it in English . Natsu campu . Summer campu . How about now ? Still a little tight ! I can see fish , Ordy . Come on , man ! Contact , two miles out . Contact , E.T.A. 21 seconds . Summer campu . Contact , 700 yards out . Summer camp . Champion , when I was 12 . Are you kidding me ? Here we go . Whoa ! Holy sh- - On my mark . Three . Two . One . Light ' em up . Boom . Yeah ! Three miles till Saddle Ridge is within range . - Status of weps . - - They 're bringing up the rounds from the lower mag . Sir ? Clear the bridge . Clear the bridge ! All right , move ! Shit ! Ordy ! Get up ! Let 's go ! Go , go , go ! - We 've got two down , sir ! - Get up . Evacuate immediately ! - Come on ! Move ! - Go , go ! Go ! Go , go , go ! Get in the water ! Go ! Going down ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on . Come on ! Raikes ! Let 's go , Raikes ! Right here ! You 're almost there . Come on ! Keep coming ! Let 's go . We gotta jump ! That 's the John Paul Jones . That 's Hopper . Relax , Sam . I 'm seeing a lot of lifeboats in the water . You say the satellite will be in position in three hours ? - Yeah , that 's correct . - So if they miss it , they have to wait . My uplink never misses . It 's not gonna miss . - How are your driving skills ? - What does that mean ? They 're horrible . Not your driving . Sam ! How are your driving skills ? Good . Let 's see if we can 't buy the world another day . Wh- - Who talks like that ? Just get in the vehicle . Let 's go . I 'm not getting in . This is your show now . I don 't have a death wish . Thank you very much . Good-bye , everyone . Stop ! Stop . This is my property . It doesn 't end like this . What do you want us to do , Hopper ? We have no ships left . We have one . We 've got a battleship . Are you crazy ? That 's a museum . Not today . This ship is 70 years old . It 's totally outdated . The firing systems are all analog . The engines haven 't been started in a decade- - which would be fine , but they 're steam , which I have no idea how to fire up . And even if I had a user 's manual and six weeks to go through it all , we still don 't have enough crew to fire it up . I don 't know what you 're thinking , sir . Is everyone all right ? Yes , sir . We 're okay . You men have given so much to your country , and no one has the right to ask any more of you , but I 'm asking . What do you need , son ? I need to borrow your boat .

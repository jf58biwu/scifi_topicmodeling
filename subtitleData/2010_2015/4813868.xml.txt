 There is an alternate universe , and in it , another version of us . - Agent Farnsworth ? - Broyles , Phillip , colonel . That woman processes more information in an hour than you and I in a lifetime . Thirty-seven people in the intersection , 22 cars , four trucks . Wind speeds of 5 to 10 miles an hour . And that is just to start . They kidnapped Olivia to the Other Side for weeks . That awful woman pranced around my lab . She 's evil . She 's a temptress . And I fell right into her vagenda . Vagenda ? - That an Observer ? - That what you call them ? They 're not limited by our human perception of time . I think these guys show up at important moments . We 've been looking at these people for three years . Why did he make contact now ? Malignant ? But it 's small and it 's the early days . And with radiation , this type of carcinoma is 95 percent treatable . Ninety-five percent survivable , Chet . That 's better odds then you get driving up the MassPike . I 've known you what , 20 years ? We 're going to get through this . Tissue connectivity . - That 's what goes last . - I 'm sorry ? First there 's the cure , radiation . It makes you sick , weak . But it doesn 't work . Not this time , not in your case . The cancer has multiplied . They try chemo . But the cell replication rate is just too high . Your bones hurt . They ache . They burn . Renal failure comes next and soon you lose all mobility below the waist . Impotence , incontinence and , finally , full respiratory failure . All from one tiny mole . Doctor told me I have a 95 percent chance . You 're the other five percent . Initiate scan . Welcome , agent . - You wanted to see us ? - The bridge was activated an hour ago . An agent crossed over without any mission imperative . - Who was it ? - Are you suggesting someone defected ? I can 't imagine . It was Agent Farnsworth . That 's impossible . - Who gave her clearance ? - She did . Farnsworth has the same security clearance as any senior Fringe agent . In fact , she 's responsible for processing transit papers and clearance . - It never occurred to us ... - She would use it herself . - Correct . - What 's she doing over there ? We don 't know . She went off the grid immediately after crossing over . All right . Let 's send a team of agents to retrieve her . No . She must have had a reason . Astrid doesn 't do anything without a reason . And after the day she 's had ... I got a hunch where she 's headed . I 'll go get her . What would you say to some eggs ? I had a marvelous dream last night in which eggs played a prominent part . I would say we 've only been working for three hours but we 've taken two food breaks . At this rate , I 'll never get home . I miss the other one . - Heh , I 'm almost afraid to ask . - Boy . The other boy . - He doesn 't starve me . - Which other boy ? - The one who plays chess . - Lincoln ? That 's the one . I prefer him . Lincoln 's not here , Walter . He 's in Hartford . It 's his goddaughter 's birthday . And I 'd be happy to play with you after we finish our work . Frankly , I don 't think you 'd be much of a challenge . I got a challenge for you . Why don 't we fix the machine ? Hello . Hello . How about you and I share some delightful scrambled eggs , Astro ? It 's Astrid . That 's funny . You never correct me . You 're not you , are you ? I don 't think what he meant was " I 'll call you " I think what he meant was , " I will never call you . " - Hello . - Aah ! - What happened ? - I always wondered why nobody does that . What are you doing here , agent ? I came here to meet her . Hi . Hello . Olivia told me about you . But it 's nice to meet you personally , in the flesh . All personal meetings are in the flesh . Yes , I suppose they are . I thought I would come here . I didn 't know where to go after . Mother might have had traditions for such occasions . I don 't know . I don 't remember her . My mother died of cancer when I was a girl . Did yours as well ? Yes . At first I thought I would walk in the park . But it was so cold . And I could not stop thinking about the words Reverend Stewart said . What a leader he was . A great man . A great friend . Reverend Stewart said he would be sorely missed . And they lowered the box down into the ground and we put down flowers . I didn 't know where to go . Because the park was so cold . May I ask you a question ? Yours , did you love him ? Astrid ? What 's going on ? I think my f ... I think her father is dead . Dunham . Perhaps you would both like to join me in a plate of eggs with chives . Walter , now 's not the time . Nonsense . Nearly all cultures react to death with food . Okay , we just caught a case . And , uh , my double 's on her way here to sort this out . - Bolivia ? The viper ? - Walter . Wha ... ? I know . Detente . Doesn 't mean I have to like her . Do you think one of us should wait here with ... ? No . There 's no need . We will be fine . - Astrid ... - Really ? You get her name right . Astrid and I can wait here alone , can 't we dear ? I 'm sure she 'll be great company . Boston police found the body at 9 : 30 this morning . He was coming home from his doctor 's office . Less than six hours ago , Chet Williams was diagnosed with stage I melanoma . Stage I. That has a survival rate of 95 percent . And that 's without introducing even one frog rectally to slow cell division . - What ? - What ? Nothing . So , what are these ? Bad mascara day ? I 'd say a bad day all around . Hey , can someone actually cry blood ? Rarely . Certain viruses , Ebola say , can cause bleeding from the tear ducts but only after most of the organs are liquefied . - Check his crotch . - I 'm sorry ? Don 't be a prude . Yeah . You see ? There 's no bleeding from the urethra so I would say his organs are not liquefied . Okay , good news . Walter says his organs haven 't liquefied . - What else can cause this ? - Nothing . Nothing real at least . There is a legendary alchemical mixture a potion as it were , called the Tears of Ra . Egyptians used it to euthanize beloved pets so that they could be buried with their owners who predeceased them . But it 's just a myth . Bring the body back to the lab . And also , I 'd like some vanilla ice cream . Kirk out . You talk through her ? Your Astrid . You talk through her , as if you were one person . Yes . You could say it that way . It must be pleasant . Yes . I suppose it is . Thanks . Follow us back to the lab . Yeah . All right . Keep me posted . Right . I think we have located it . Point-26 pounds . Seventeen percent lighter than an average human kidney . Okay . Chet Williams , 38 years old . Manufactures consumer goods overseas . Uh , single . No debt . No drug issues . His friends say that he 's a nice guy . So nobody someone would wanna kill . Well , everybody has somebody who wants to kill them . And , voila , the deadly culprit reveals itself . Odd . Always makes me nervous when he says that . An interaction of chemical compounds I 've not seen before . Aspirin . But predictive science says that these compounds shouldn 't interact but they do . - So , what , you 're saying that it 's magic ? - It 's science , just unusual science . Huh . The way that six different alcohols create a flavor identical to iced tea . Amen to that . It works , but no one could have predicted it would work . So you 're saying he was killed by a poison no one invented ? It should go without saying , but that 's impossible . I think we 're aware of that , Peter . Ah . Isn 't this a party ? Hey , girls . Mata Hari . Deceived and betrayed anyone yet today ? - It is almost lunchtime after all . - Deus ex machina . A hand of God . The interaction of the chemicals in the poison is not predictable . The creation of the toxin requires the assumption the compounds intermingle . These compounds do not intermingle , except when they are all mixed , they do which is a completely unpredictable event . Okay , just so I 'm clear . You 're saying that a person would have to see the chemicals had been combined in order to know how to combine them ? Yes . The chances of that occurring randomly are less than one-tenth of 1 percent . Therefore there is a root of the equation that is outside our realm of causality . - Deus ex machina . The hand of God . - Heh . Astrid , are you trying to tell us that God taught our perp how to mix a mythical poison ? God or godlike powers . It 's the only thing that makes sense . Come with me . I 'll need your help to identify the origin of these component compounds . I think I love her . Okay , well , I guess that , uh , we 're not gonna go straight home . - Cold Chinese in the fridge ? - Uh ... Yeah . I 'll check . Here you go . You 're putting up a good fight but you 're not going to win . You 're gonna take that drink , and from there , it 's all downhill . But you know the saddest part ? The drinking doesn 't kill you . Instead it shatters the lives of everyone around you . Everyone you love . Your boyfriend is going to be killed in a car accident with you behind the wheel . Your brother is going to alienate his wife and daughter throw away his own future trying to rescue you . - But he fails . - No one can see the future . You 're right . There is no future . There 's no past . Everything happens right now . Now that you 're back , I can finally rid myself of this junk that you left behind in your haste to slink away . Walter , you 've been holding onto this stuff all this time ? I didn 't steal anything , if that 's what you 're implying . Although , I admit that this one item confounded me . Just another of your tools of spycraft , I imagine . A sinister communication device ? Some kind of devious encoder ? Wow . I really got to you , didn 't I , Walter ? Did you ever consider that perhaps it 's because you enjoyed having me around . Admit it . You like me Walter . Walter ? We 're setting up . Dr. Bishop ? Dr. Bishop , your Astrid is summoning you . The Fringe team is at the scene . Way this woman died , and I say this with experience is among the weirdest things I 've ever seen . - Was she bleeding from her eyes ? - How did you know ? There seems to be a lot of that going around . You mind opening up ? I 'd love to take a look . Asterisk , collect a DNA sample . - Astrid , can you hand me a cotton swab ? - Hang on . I wanna get a DNA sample . - So the cops said ... - Hang on a second . Seems to be some hemorrhaging of the nasal passage . - You think she inhaled something ? - Yeah , possibly . Could be how they delivered the poison . I 'm sorry , Walter , what were you were saying ? Doesn 't matter . Please ask Agent Dunham to bring the body ... We 're gonna need to get this body back to the lab . - You work that out with the ME 's office ? - Yeah . Does he always do all the jobs ? These scalpels could use some sharpening . - And you 're sharing that with me why ? - I thought you 'd sharpen them for me . You said you wanted to help . I had meant with the autopsy , Walter . The screws in the rib-spreader could also use a little tightening . You 're angry with your son . He is not my son . As I understand it , in a different timeline , he is . So he says . Do you feel love for him ? I have found anger inevitably seems to be conjoined with emotional investment . Do you think that is the case ? Peter is a reminder of the son I had and wished had lived . But he is not that son . And that makes you suffer ? Yes . In that case , wouldn 't it be preferable if you chose to believe he was your son ? And then you could love him and be happy . I 'm sorry , but I 'm just not seeing any connection between the victims . Heh . Secretary 's son , he 's cute , huh ? I bet he 's all contradictory and tricky like his dad . Yeah , I imagine he 's just your type . Actually , no . Turns out I like the nice guys . So neither of the victims lived in the same neighborhood . They didn 't go to the same gym , got no mutual friends . There has to be a connection . We just haven 't found it . You say that with such conviction because ? If there isn 't a link then we 've got a killer on the loose and no lead to find him . Flight 328 to San Antonio is now ready for boarding at Gate 38B . Flight 328 to San Antonio is now ready for boarding at Gate 38B . Have a nice flight . Look , honey , I 'm at the security thing . I gotta call you back , okay ? Have a nice flight . Look , take it down a notch , okay ? Yeah , I wanted to get this over with too . What ? No , no , it 's not a ruse . I told you I missed the flight this morning , there 's nothing I could do . Bill . Bill , listen to me , I 'm hanging up the phone right now . Call me back when you get a personality I can deal with . Can I help you ? Making your next call will destroy your life . - Excuse me ? - You 'll be driving . When a taxi cuts you off , your reaction won 't be quick enough . You only have one hand on the wheel . Oh , okay . Well , thanks , pal , but my life really is none of your business . Your car is gonna flip , shattering your spinal cord . You 're left a paraplegic . And with no family , you end up in a group home . The man who runs it is not kind . Your body will be discovered more than 10 hours after you die . No one mourns . I 'm gonna spare you from all of that misery . A painless exit from a living nightmare . Jared Colin . Apparently his attacker tried to spray him with some kind of atomizer . Yeah , that sounds like our guy . He said he 'd never seen the man before , so why ? What 's his motive ? Hmm . The feds , I take it . Too many years in this job . Lawyers and cops , I can spot you guys a mile away . Uh , I 'm Agent Olivia Dunham and this is Peter Bishop . What can you tell us about Colin , doctor ? Well , it 's not good news . We saved his life , but his spinal cord is severed right below T1 so he is not gonna walk again . Come on , he 's down here . I wasn 't even supposed to be in town . I was heading down to Dallas . Selling my company to my scumbag partner who for six years has made my life a living hell . Today was gonna be the day that I started over . A new beginning . I had a water bottle in my carry-on and by the time the damn TSA was done with me , I missed my flight . Besides his description , is there anything else that you can tell us ? Anything that you remember ? Yeah . He had this weird rod . It was blue . And he 'd look into it like he 's some kind of fortune teller . He said I was gonna have a car accident and I was gonna end up like this . So this guy predicted what would happen ? Not exactly , but I guess exactly doesn 't really matter now . We think it 's possible that the man who attacked you also killed at least another two other people . Do you recognize either of them ? No . He said he wanted to put me out of my misery . Like he was doing a good deed . Like he was some kind of saint . I tell you , I wish he had . I wish he 'd done it . I wish he 'd killed me . Nothing to link them . - Period . Goose egg . - Period . Goose egg . - Zilch . - Zilch . Would you like a cup of coffee ? I 'm gonna make a fresh pot . Coffee ? I understand that has quite an interesting flavor . Yeah , I suppose it does . Have you never had any ? Where I come from , coffee is very rare and thus very expensive . I 've never had the privilege . Yes , I would like that . Thank you , Astrid . You 're welcome , sweetie . Sweetie ? Did you ask ? I didn 't hear you ask . May I ? Certainly not . That 's right . You 're still mad at me . Yes , and now you 're breaking my concentration as well . Oh , I 'm sorry . Were you solving world hunger ? Or perfecting the perfect peanut butter milkshake ? If you must know , I was musing on our killer . Agent Dunham reports that he may be attempting to put his victims out of their misery . If that 's the case , then his murder weapon of choice is consistent . - The Tears of Ra ? - Yes . It 's painless and instantaneous . It begins to make sense now . So we 're looking for what , a humanitarian killer ? Or a compassionate one . Okay , so you 're saying that the killer believes he is saving his victims from a lifetime of suffering by killing them ? That sounds like an extremely contorted view of compassion . Some suffering is worse than death . - What is Logan International ? - It 's an airport . Why ? - All three victims traveled through there . - Is that right ? - How did you miss that ? - I didn 't . They all had different airlines . They had different destinations . Mr. Williams was , what , two weeks ago ? Kerry Watson was last month . Yes , their travel vouchers indicate that . What is TSA ? Uh , Transportation Security Administration . They screen every passenger for safety . In that case , correlating their voucher stamps I believe they may each have been screened by the same security agent . She 's right . TSA badge 0047 . My . Thank you . Have a nice flight . Hey . Stop that man . - Hey . Whoa ! Stop right there . - Federal agents . We 're in pursuit of a suspect . You either have a boarding pass or authorization . Do you want me to find you a supervisor ? I was surprised the FBI was doing a background check on Neil . We were surprised to learn he was previously employed as a professor at MIT . Yeah . I could tell on the phone . But how does an advanced mathematics professor end up working for the TSA ? I suppose he loses his mind . It 'd be an understatement to say people here are driven but Neil put them all to shame . The youngest tenure-track professor ever . Brilliant . And a little bit mad to begin with , I suppose . Like most mathematicians , he believed that math was the key to unlocking the secrets of the universe . - I know how that sounds . - Not as crazy as you might think . Well , a couple years ago he came back from summer break at his lake house and he was just changed . He said that he 'd found something , although he wouldn 't say what . But he 'd become obsessed with differential equations that no one could make heads or tails of . He had a theory that if he could solve the equations space and time could be flattened so they would all be on a level plane . Define that . What do you mean " flattened " ? Well , that you could , in essence see past , present and future simultaneously . Well , eventually , solving the equations became more important than class and soon he just left , didn 't come back . Now , from what I heard , he went back to the lake house but this working at the TSA ? Now , that surprises me . Where was that lake house ? I 'm not sure . Somewhere in eastern New York . He wanted his mail forwarded . Oh , here we are . Reiden Lake . When you first appeared in this time line , it was at Reiden Lake . What 's going on , Peter ? Neil thought he could see past , present and future all in the same time . That 's what the Observers do . We 've never been able to figure out how . But in my time line , an Observer saved my life . It also happened at Reiden Lake . When Walter crossed over when I was a child to being me back the ice broke , we both fell in . It was an Observer who pulled us out . Are you suggesting that an Observer is somehow behind this ? That he 's using Neil ? I don 't know . I think we should take a drive . What 's he doing ? Thinking . You care for him . I suppose I do . Yeah . Like a father ? My father ... I cannot get the thought out of my mind that ... That I couldn 't give him what he wanted because of the way that I am . That he secretly wished I could love him back in a way that he could understand . Do you think if I were more like you , he would have loved me more ? If I was normal ? I think I would prefer this beverage with sugar . Who leaves their door unlocked when they 're not home ? You 're right . It 's not safe . Well , we 're in the right place . Take a look at this . Neil was a twin . His brother and father were killed in an accident . So Gandhi , Joan of Arc all the rest of them . What 's the connection ? They 're heroes ? What else do they all have in common ? They 're all saviors . So where 's Neil ? Where are you going ? I don 't understand . What do you mean you are here to say goodbye ? - Where are you going ? - I told you . " Where I belong " is not an answer . Were you fired again ? I told you , Mom , I wasn 't fired from MIT , I left . What ? I heard you that night , you know . The night Alex died . You said God took the wrong one . " Why did God take my angel ? " You kept saying . You always resented that I wasn 't Alex . Not your angel . I was afraid that you were right . That I 'll never be good enough . As good as he was . But God had a plan . He let me live for a reason . I know that now . God gave me a way to see the future . - What ? - What ? - Stop . Don 't do that . You 're scaring me . - Stop . Don 't do that . You 're scaring me . God gave me a way to see the future , so I could give people mercy . Neil , I 'm sorry . What you heard that night about your brother you should never have heard that . But I did . And I 'm glad . Every time I saw the disapproving look in your eye , it drove me harder . To separate myself through accomplishment . That 's why God took notice . Because of you . Neil . Neil , stop this . Jesus knew the Romans were coming for him . He could have avoided his death so easily . But he didn 't . He had faith that God had a plan . I understand God 's plan for me now . And I 'm willing to go . - FBI . Open this door or we come in . - FBI ? FBI . Put your hands up . Don 't you remember , Mom ? What the priest said about Alex at the funeral ? Stand up slowly and put your hands behind your head . Angels don 't belong on Earth . Keep your hands where I can see them and turn around very slowly . I 'll see you in heaven . No ! No ! Hey . How you holding up ? You know , he wasn 't trying to hit me . He fired at the window on purpose . How do you know that ? I think he knew he were coming and he wanted us to shoot him . I guess it makes sense . He could see the past , present and future . But he had a gun . Why not just shoot himself ? Because he was religious . If he committed suicide , he wouldn 't be allowed into heaven . - What about the people he killed ? - He thought he was saving them . This was his way to become an angel . Peter ? I know it 's taken me some getting used to but as long as you 're stuck here , you make a good partner . Thank you . Dr. Bishop , we are leaving . Hey , Walter . Here . I wanna show you something . My ingenious piece of spy tech . Mints ? Similar . They 're Bobbins . And they 're delicious . It 's almost like wintergreen . Only smokier . - One for the road . - You 're giving me a send-off ? You may possess positive qualities that I previously overlooked . - Are you flirting with me ? - In your dreams . It was really nice meeting you . It was amazing , actually . Yes . What you said before ? My father ... We 're not very close either . He 's a very complex man . He doesn 't really show emotion . He does the best with the tools he has . That 's just how he is . I know he loves me . At least , that 's what I tell myself . Even though it doesn 't really seem that way . You shouldn 't regret that you could 've been more for him . It wasn 't you . Thank you , Agent Farnsworth . You 're welcome , Agent Farnsworth . Hey . Well , look who 's here . - Hi , Dad . - Mm . That kind of day , huh ? Yeah . That kind of a day . - Wanna tell me about it ? - Yes . But you know that I can 't . Yeah . I know . But at least I can feed you . And I can give my baby girl a big old hug . Aww . I love you , Dad . I love you too , Astrid . Here it is . You were right . It 's September 's . He must have lost it in 1985 , the night he didn 't save the boy . He 'll be interested to know what happened to it . There 's something else . It appears that September did not obey your instructions . The boy is back . Peter Bishop has returned .

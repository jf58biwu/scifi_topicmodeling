THEY 'RE PRETTY SMART . THEY KNOW WHEN THEY 'RE BEING HUNTED . THEY GONNA HUNKER DOWN AND LAY LOW . THEY CAN GO WEEKS WITHOUT EATING AND THEN JUST WHEN YOU EASE UP AND YOU STOP LOOKING THEY 'RE BACK WITH VENGEANCE . - SO WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE ? - ALLIGATOR AND CROCODILE AND MORTAL ENEMIES . I SAY WE BRING 'EM TOGETHER . WE MAKE ' EM FIGHT . AND THEN HOPEFULLY WE CAN TAKE OUT THE WINNER WHEN IT 'S MOST VULNERABLE . - SO , HOW DO YOU PROPOSE WE DO THAT ? ALL SET ? - EVERYTHING 'S ON BOARD , SIR . - WHAT 'S GOING ON THERE ? - JUST , UH , SENDING SOME HATE MAIL . - WHAT ? - NOTHING , I-I 'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT LATER . - YOU KNOW , SON , YOU LOOK LIKE A DAMN FOOL IN THAT SHIRT .

SEE THEM LIZARDS , THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO HIDE UNDER A PALM TREE OR IN THE WATER , BUT THEY AIN 'T GONNA HIDE FROM THIS . NOW WE FLY OVER THEM , THE HEAT SIGNATURE 'S GONNA SHOW UP ON THE SCREEN . - IT STILL DOESN 'T EXPLAIN HOW YOU 'RE GONNA GET ' EM INTO THE RING . - A GATOR AND A CROCODILE ARE REALLY SENSITIVE TO SOUND .

BUILT OVER FIVE DECADES AGO IN 1953 THE RESORT ULTIMATELY EXPANDED TO OVER 400 ROOMS . IT BECAME THE PREMIER HOTEL ON THE ISLAND BEFORE HURRICANE NIKKI LEFT IT IN RUINS IN 1992 . DURING IT 'S HEYDAY WITH ITS LUSH GREEN SCENERY AND IT 'S WHITE SANDY BEACHES IT BROUGHT HOLLYWOOD ICONS LIKE BING CROSBY , FRANK SINATRA , AND YES , EVEN ELVIS PRESLEY TO THE RESORT . - OH , WHAT ROOM DID THE KING STAY IN ? - I KNEW SOMEONE WAS GOING TO ASK THAT .

THE COCO PALMS RESORT ACHIEVED EARLY EXPOSURE AND FAME IN THE 1958 FILM , " SHE-GODS OF SHARK REEF . " VIRTUALLY , THE ENTIRE CLIMAX OF THE MOVIE WAS SHOT RIGHT HERE ON THE GROUNDS OR NEAR THE HOTEL . - I REMEMBER THAT FILM . IT WAS A LOT OF FUN . BUT WHERE 'S THIS ELVIS ROOM YOU SPOKE ABOUT ? - I KNOW , DON 'T WORRY . I PROMISE WE 'RE GETTING THERE . NOW , IF YOU 'LL ALL FOLLOW ME , PLEASE .

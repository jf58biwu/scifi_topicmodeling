 my name is Holly King i 'm a psychology student at the university of oregon in two thousand eight i saw a news report about thirty elite scientists that had gotten together in a remote area at the Ural mountains in Russia They 're trying to solve the mystery that had battled the world for almost fifty years it had become known as the " Dyatlov Pass incident " after a leader of an expedition there in 1959 named Igor Dyatlov They failed . But I was riveted by this story so when my favorite professor doctor kettles assigned the class of project on that very same incident i couldn 't believe it I mentioned it to a buddy of mine , Jansen , a film student here and he said that we should make a film we applied for a grant we got it . we applied for a grant and we got it okay So tell us what happened uh ... first heard about the incident mandanna russian journalist named urea like published a fictionalized counterfeit in the book course they had him killed made in matter the fictionalized they didn 't want anybody talking about Dyatlov and i began using the fact that the incident as a teaching exercise in psychology because there 's too much that we know that what happened at Dyatlov 's Pass so many details and yet the whole thing remain she in mystery words and What explanations to that the most common called scientific explanation I get a condition called hypothermic dementia hypothermic diementia That is literally what

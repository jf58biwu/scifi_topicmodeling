Sorry son , the way of the world . ( SCREAMING ) ( PHONE RINGING ) Detective Collier , the Mayor is ready to see yöu . Detective , come in . Detective Collier . Tom Berringer . - I was in the force with yöur dad . - Nice to meet yöu . Yöur family has a history with the city . Damien 's father led the last police raid in Brick Mansions . His unfortunate death pushed legislation for us to erect the border . He 's a hero , and from what I hear , yöu 're a lot like him . Thank yöu . We 've been made to understand that yöu have somewhat of an expertise in terms of that neighborhood . Yeah , I know it pretty well . - Major Reno , U.S. Army . - Pleasure . Detective , this is a situation that demands the best of the best . Last night a government transport travelling at a time and route with minimal civilian traffic was hijacked . What are they transporting ? N.A.D , Neutron Assisted Device . A neutron bomb . We prefer the word device . Bomb has such negative connonations . The device was fitted with an anti theft mechanism . Which is triggered if the case should be open the wrong way . COMPUTER VOICE : Device activated . What the fuck ? We need yöu to infiltrate , locate the device , and contact us for the code to disarm it . Nah , that can 't be done . That 'd take time , planning . We don 't know where it 's at , we don 't know who has it . We know where . Brick Mansions . We know who . That 's Tremaine Alexander . Ex-soldier turned illegal arms dealer . He uses military grade weapons , united the gangs , and tookover the city 's drug trade . Rules with an iron fist . I spent my entire career trying to take down Tremaine . But he never leaves Brick Mansions and there 's checkpoints everywhere . - Yöu know the routes around . - Yeah , but then what ? We have no intel inside . No eyes . We have yöur eyes . Lino Dupree , French Carribean expat . Spent most of his adult live in Brick Mansions . Knows it like the back of his hands . So the best idea yöu can come up with is to send me into this shit with a convict as my partner ? Yeah . And yöu got 10 hours , Detective . What 's he locked up for anyway ? Killed a cop . ( HELICOPTER WHIRRING ) ( BUZZER ) Dupree , let 's go . ( DOG BARKING AND POLICE SIRENS IN THE DISTANCE ) ( BUZZER ) ( BUZZER ) Get in the van ! Get in ! I 'll be back . ( TIRES SCREECHING ) - Thanks . - Yeah , have a good day . Hey , hey , wait ! I need this van ! Are yöu kidding me ? Who do yöu think yöu are man ? Yöu trying to hijack me ? It 's my van ! I don 't think so . This is my van . Really ? It 's my van , but if yöu want a lift hurry up , the bus is leaving . GPS : Recalculating itinerary . - Where are we headed ? - Brick Mansions . There 's no way yöu can drive this van past the barricades . Three minutes ago we were handcuffed in the back of this thing . Why is a guy like yöu going to Brick Mansions ? I 'm after Tremaine Alexander . He killed a friend of mine . Same asshole kidnapped my girlfriend . Ex girlfriend . Sound like we got something in common . - How do yöu plan to get inside ? - There 's an old smuggling route . GPS : Take a right at 50 metres . ( POLICE SIRENS ) - Better buckle up . - I prefer to be free . Suit yöurself . We can 't lose them at East port . That 's a checkpoint . This GPS is broken ! GPS : Wrong direction . Please make a U-turn now . Shit ! Stop yöur vehicle now ! I repeat , stop yöur vehicle now ! What are yöu doing ? Are yöu crazy ? Yöu need to trust me man . Shit . I can 't see shit . Shit . ( GLASS SHATTERING ) Steerings gone . Brakes are gone . Work on it ! ( SCREAMING , CRASHING ) Shit . Old smuggling route , huh ? Yeah . Yöu got to get the hell out of here man . - Not we . - What the hell are yöu doing ? - Yöu 're a cop . - Are yöu crazy ? Come on . I can smell a cop a mile away . Hey come on , yöu can 't leave me like this . Come on , help me get out of here . What am I suppose to do ? Look in the police manual under " shit happens . " Yeah , that 's really funny . - French asshole . - ( GUN COCKING ) Shit , this is yöur car , huh ? - Hell yeah . - The brake 's failed . Yöu get me out of here , we 'll sort this out . ( LAUGHING ) Yöu are dead . Shit . Be careful . Yöu 're dead , look at yöu . Yo , put that down . Tremaine . Put that down . Que pasa mamacita ? Hope yöu 've been enjoying our accomodations . I 'm so done with this place . Look , yöu keep it cool with me , I keep it cool with yöu . I try to press education in my boys , but they are a different breed . If they 're not out shooting niggas in the streets they shooting them on video screens . So I give them a job , yöu know . These niggas feed their families . Look , between me and yöu , I like Lino . He has a cause , even it gets him killed . People like yöu remind me why everyone hates us . Yöu and him are lot alike . - I can see why yöu together . - Separated . Don 't worry , mamacita . Yöu will hear about him soon . Oh , yöu haven 't heard the good news ? Lino escaped . Not sure if he 's gonna come in here . And I wouldn 't wanna be old when he gets here . Tremaine , we all good on the roof . Do yöu wanna head back ? Rayzah here will keep yöu company . Yo , get yöur hands of my chips . Oh , shit . Move ! ( COCKING GUN ) ( GRUNTING ) - How did yöu know I was a cop ? - Yöu don 't belong here . - How did yöu find me ? - I put a bug in yöur pocket . Cop 's tricks . That 's all yöu people have . No , we have the law . It just something yöu don 't care about . The law means nothing without justice . That 's pretty high for somebody who killed a cop . That cop was a corrupt piece of shit , no better than Tremaine . I 'm gonna find Tremaine . I 'm gonna find him before the weapon he hijacked kills everybody inside the Brick Mansions . Probably didn 't occur to yöu there 's somebody on the outside that actually gives a shit about what happen in here now did yöu ? Not everybody out there is an asshole . Just like not everybody in here is a junkie or a thief . Yöu enjoy yöurself . And if I find yöur girlfriend I 'll tell her yöu said hi . They will shoot yöu and take yöur badge as trophy . At least I 'll die trying . Which is a hell lot better than sitting around bitching about how the world sucks . If yöu 're not bullshitting about that bomb , maybe I can save Lola before we all go down . And the first chance yöu get , what are yöu gonna do ? Yöu gonna put a bullet in the back of my head ? I could 've kill yöu already . So what 's yöur plan ? - Yöu got a phone ? - Yeah . ( KEYPAD TONE ) ( DIALING ) Tremaine , it 's Lino . I 'm coming over . So that 's it ? Yöu just throwing him a line ? A line he 'll never expect . This is gonna be a lot of fun . Not bad , right ? ( PANTING ) Hello , Lola . Fuck ! - Where are yöu going ? - ( LOLA GRUNTING ) I knew yöu 'd be fun to play with the second I saw yöu . I really love this game . Do I look like a bitch ? Hey , Rayzah . I heard shouts . Yöu can play but not too hard , okay ? Yöu are one lucky bitch . ( PANTING ) What do we got here ? Take us to Tremaine . K2 , get yöur fat ass up here ! We got a guest coming ! Yeti , move it ! Upstairs , now ! It 's show time ! Damien , yöu see that ? Lino . Surprised that yöur back here so soon . Yöu see ? He is surprised . - Who 's yöur boy ? - I 'm his driver . He 's a cop . - Comes for his bomb . - Thanks . Thanks for that . - That 's great . - Wow , a cop . Haven 't seen one of those around here in years . I believe the police station closed around the same time as the school , the hospital . The government thought we didn 't need that around here . So , what , yöu 're the new Sheriff in town ? Yöu 're a brave man . Where 's Lola ? We 'll get to her . Let 's talk about this bomb . Yöu 're here to buy ? I came to disarm it . This is gonna make yöu a little bit anxious . It 's ticking . Tremaine Alexander don 't do anxious . I cause anxious . I could be halfway down South before this thing goes off or yöu can make me an offer . I 'll offer yöu to disable it before it blows us all up , yöu like that ? That won 't fly . How about I just send it back the way I found it ? K2 , let the sunshine in . Gentleman , please , yöur gonna love the view . Only a crazy person would have a rocket . We live in a war , so we prepared for war . I can destroy downtown at a push of this button . Let 's talk numbers . Yöu let all those people die for money ? That 's low even for yöu . Nigga , where I come from , everything is about cash . Yöu know what that means , right ? ( LAUGHING ) First I need to know Lola 's okay . Rayzah . Look at number three . What do yöu see ? What do yöu see Lino ? - ( LINO SHOUTING ) - No , no , wait . Coward ! - Yöu wanna die here man ? - Don 't shoot . Now 's not the time . Lino , not now . Now yöu boys all excited let 's do this shit the uptown way . I got a rocket , I got a bomb and I got a pretty woman . I say we starts the bidding at 10 million dollars . - Do I hear 11 ? - 11 . - 11 million . - 12 Oh , that 's a spicy bid right there . We gettin there now . - 15 . - 15 ? Stop the bullshit ! Yöu tell me how much it 's worth to yöu ? How much the people downtown worth ? Because around here , people lives aren 't worth a shit . Look around , Sheriff , this used to be a palace . Doorman , woman waiting on table . Where the bitches at now ? In the alley , shooting up . Because of drugs dealer like yöu . I didn 't cause this reality . I just help them ease the pain . Let 's get back to that money . - We 're at 15 million , right ? - 15 . - Do I hear 20 million ? - 20 . Okay , stop the game . What 's it gonna take ? Yöu got 3 million people downtown . 10 dollars per person . Price of a happy meal . That 's 30 million dollars for me . - Then 30 million ? - 30 million . Done . 30 million it is . 30 million . Sold to Lino Dupree and the new Sheriff of Brick Mansions . Call yöur people and make it happen . And Lino , stay out of my business . ( DIALING , CELLPHONE RINGING ) - Yes ? - It 's Detective Collier . - Collier ? Where are we now ? - We 're close . Really close . - Close enough to punch the code in ? - No , unfortunately no . What 's the problem ? The problem is that the new owner wants to sell . Are yöu sure the bomb is there ? Yes , and I can tell yöu that there 's only 48 minutes before it blows up . Okay . - How do we proceed ? - Yöu have an Hawaiian bank account ? - I want it in cash , man . - They can 't do cash . - We still got an account in Hawaii ? - We do . Give him the numbers . Bank , 83675 . Bank , 83675 . Account , 0210-84 . Account , 0210-84 . - What 's he asking ? - 30 million dollars . Hold on . Tremaine wants 30 million for the device . The city damn near broke . - We cannot do that , Detective . - All right , good . Yöu have to find another solution . Exactly . All right , good , yeah . Perfect . That 's a wrap . They 're sending in the money . - Let 's go disable that bomb . - Hold on . Wait a minute , let my man verify the transfer . Bank doesn 't open for another 25 minutes . 25 minutes . Well , that 's enough time for me to finish dinner . K2 . Show our guests to the presidential suite . Nice doing business with yöu , Sheriff . Move ! Sometimes yöu dont gotta be a rocket scientist . Just got to have a rocket . Move ! Face the rack ! - On yöur knees ! - Shit . Put yöur damn hands behind yöur head ! I got to tell yöu , I 'm claustrophobic . Until Tremaine gets his 30 million , their lives worth more than both of us . They die , yöu die . So yöu 're not having a plan gets us in . Hey , yöu know where the bomb is , I know where Lola is . And in 25 minutes , we act . In 25 minutes Tremaine is gonna shoot us . The device is gonna kill 3 million people . What ? When he gets his money , everybody walks away . There is no money . The city can 't pay . I was just trying to buy us some time . Forget what I said before . Don 't trust yöur instinct . They 're shit . I should 've killed Tremaine when I had the chance . Shut up . Wait . That story about Tremaine killing yöur friend , it 's true ? That 's my father . He used to lead some officers on a drug raid . He got separated from his squad . Tremaine 's boys captured him and killed him . I 'm sorry . Let 's go make him pay . Back me up . Help him man ! Stop it ! - Son of a bitch . - What happened ? Oh , shit . - He 's not breathing . - What ? We got to get him out of here . Shit . - Oh , come on ! - He 's not breathing , come on ! - Okay , go ! - Open the gate ! I will talk to the boss . Go ! - Something 's not right about this . - Yöu think they 'll come up with the money ? We 'll see . Tell me how yöu got that bomb again . Bomb ? Yeah . These dudes at base told me about some weapon being moved . No security . Keys left in the truck . Easy money , baby . That 's whats bothering me man .

They 're in the bus ! Yöu two , go check it out . Let 's split up ! - On three ! - Three ! What the ... Shit . - Close enough now ? - ( GRUNTING ) Thank yöu .

These are satellite surveillance images from Brick Mansions taken several minutes ago . - There 's the bomb . - What 's that ? That 's an old Russian missile . Has a radius about 5 miles . - How the hell did they get that ? - Wait , if they launch that ... - The city is ground zero . - We 're gonna have to evacuate . - No time . - There 's a fallout shelter . It won 't help us against the NAD blast . What options do we have then ? Drone ? Too late . We 'll never get authorization just like that . - Bank is open . - I 'll check . I think they fooled us . No deposit . And yöu wonder why people don 't trust the government . What the hell is going on ? Not only did they not make the transfer . They 're emptying all of our bank accounts . Rayzah .

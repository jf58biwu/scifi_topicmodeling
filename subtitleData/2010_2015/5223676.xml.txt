 HARKEN : Previously , on Alphas . ROSEN : When I first discovered the Alpha phenomenon , I was a doctor treating a group of remarkable patients , including my daughter , Dani . Can you be my partner ? A partner ? ROSEN : People fear what they do not understand or what they cannot control . Go to sleep . ROSEN : The government 's solution to the problem is Binghamton . A clandestine prison hospital where Alphas are confined , and subjected to experiments without any respect paid to their civil rights or their humanity . And by our keeping the Alpha phenomenon secret , we are only following a path , which I believe can only lead to a war against a rogue group of Alphas organized by their leader , Stanton Parish . I am calling for transparency . An end to secrets . Alphas exist . They are among us . They are our friends and our spouses . This is what we have been hiding . I warned you . Security ! ... that Stanton Parish ... Get him out of here . Get this man out of here . ... so badly wants . ROSEN : And by sharing this truth , it will become evident that it 's time for everyone to open their eyes , to open their minds and to open their ... ( STATIC ) ROSEN : I see you 've been picking your cuticles again . I suspect it 's this place . Being here , day in and day out , must be incredibly stressful for you . I find yoga and meditation particularly efficacious in an environment like this . What about the drugs ? Did they help ? Well , you should try some and see for yourself . I 'm not psychologically unstable . Natalie , you are deflecting again . Why are we here , Dr. Rosen ? ( ROSEN SIGHING ) You know , I could ask you the same question . I 'm here because the government wants me out of the way . Shelved . For exposing the Alphas phenomenon . Delusions of persecution . A classic symptom of paranoia . I am not delusional , though I am being persecuted . Lee , you know how this goes . You can deny your issues , or you can commit to therapy and maybe I can help . Oh , please . We both know my fate has nothing to do with these sessions . Hour 's up . Talked to my boy , Doc . You were right . It was the stuff with the dog . Oh , I 'm glad I could help . Children mourn differently than we do . Just remember that . Be patient , and just encourage him to express himself . We 're working on it . That 's your stop . Yes . Indeed , it is . Let me get that for you . You okay , Doc ? No , William . I am not okay . I 've been here eight months . Eight wasted months . I have important things to do . I ... Patients , clients . I need to get out of here . Sorry , Doc . Wish I could help . ( WHEELS SQUEAKING ) ( MUZAK PLAYING ) Alphas ? Do you seriously believe in that crap ? World is filled with surprises . How much longer we got to be here ? You in a rush ? Trying to get home to watch Storage Wars ? Tip said sometime today . Alright , well , this Muzak is killing me . I 'm tired of reading deodorant labels . You can always switch to hemorrhoid cream . ( WHISPERING ) Douchebag . That would be aisle three , Hicks . Yeah . ( GLASS SHATTERING ) ( ALL SCREAMING ) It 's on ! Cover the exits . Back corner ! HICKS : She 's an Alpha ! She tapped into the cable ! Pull her loose ! ( ALL SCREAMING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( GUNSHOTS FIRING ) Everybody down ! This is a robbery ! ( HEARTBEAT THUMPING ) ( GLASS SHATTERING ) Surprise ! You 're not the only one . ( GRUNTING ) Drop it ! ( BOTH GRUNTING ) HICKS : I said drop it ! Hicks , cover your ears ! ( LOUD DRONING ) ( DRONING CONTINUES ) Let 's go ! ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ) Meg ! We 're leaving ! Uh-huh . Hicks , get the rest . ( POLICE SIREN WAILING ) Hicks , get ' em . OFFICER : Take ' em down ! We 've got two males heading west on 43rd . Silver pickup . No rear plate . Don 't take no for an answer There 's no telling where we 've been Because people don 't understand , understand , understand People don 't understand People like me MAN ON RADIO : Standing by 1515 Broadway just east of ... HICKS : Harken . Yo , Harken . ( CLEARING THROAT ) What 's up , Hicks ? I can 't spell worth a crap . What ... What is it ? ( STAMMERING ) U before E , except after ... You kidding me ? You know there 's a spell check on that thing . What , are your adrenals kicking your ass ? You 're kind of looking a little pasty there . You know , I mean , for you . ( SIGHING ) Don 't hate . Appreciate . Okay ? Besides , which one of us actually caught someone and which one of us shot and killed a parking meter ? Friggin ' meter had it coming . Sorry . I kind of screwed the pooch . Don 't blame yourself . You want to blame somebody , you blame Clay . Some damn intel , please ? Is that too much to ask ? You know ? " Hey , freaks , FYI , you might want to bring some earplugs . " Besides , we still bagged one out of three , which is more than I can say for Clay and his boys . Take it easy on Clay . He 's a Pittsburgh Pirates fan . He suffers enough . That 's a self-inflicted wound . Dude is still in there ? He couldn 't get a Girl Scout to confess her favorite cookie . HICKS : So that 's Megan Bates ? So look , neurodiversity . What is that ? E-U ? U-E ? You have been logging in to that chat room , haven 't you ? Helping Alphas , right ? That 's part of our job . I 'm telling you , there 's a lot of people in that chat room . That got questions . That chat room is filled with pimply-faced teenagers pretending to be Alphas . You 're probably the only real Alpha on there . Maybe . Gary goes on there sometimes . Really ? Mmm . Has he logged in lately ? His mother left a voice-mail yesterday saying , uh , he stopped calling . Nothing for two weeks . No , I haven 't heard from him . Should have never let Clay assign Gary to the NSA . Well , it 's not like we had a choice . Look , I 'll rattle their cage , remind them to let him call home . Come on . What are you doing ? No . No coffee . What are you doing ? Come on . Whoa . You drop dead of a heart attack , and I 'm on my own . ( SIGHING ) We 're a team . Look , I hate to break it to you , but without Rosen , there is no team . ( PEOPLE TALKING LOUDLY ) ( MACHINE WHIRRING ) ( LOUD MECHANICAL NOISE ) ( ENGINE ROARING ) Rachel . ( GASPING ) Daddy . So loud . It 's a beautiful day . You haven 't left the house in months . You quit your job , you move back home . Fine . But hiding in your room ? ( BEE BUZZING ) Jumping at every sound ? ( CLICKING ) ( FLAPPING ) ( STATIC ) Rachel , don 't tune me out . Please , Baba . I 'm just tired , okay ? Hey . I found you a new therapist . No . Rachel , he can help . Baba , there 's only one person that I 've ever trusted , and he 's gone . So , please . Okay ? I just want to rest . ( SIGHING ) Have a wonderful day , now . And that 's an order . MAN : They say there 's no such thing as Alphas ! But I know . Alphas control the world ! They 're everywhere ! Alphas control the world ! MAN 2 : Hey . They put thoughts into my head . MAN 2 : Back off . Terrible thoughts beamed into my brain . You . ( ECHOING ) You need to stop talking . We don 't use beams . MAN : Taxi ! ( WHISTLES ) Taxi ! Excuse me . ( ECHOING ) Let 's share a cab . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) CLAY : It 's the wife . The phone doesn 't work inside . I 'll catch up . Come on . Hicks , what are you doing ? You 're not supposed to take that off . Let her have some fresh air . This is Binghamton . No , not just Binghamton . HARKEN : Nice girl like you gets the upgrade . Building Seven ? You think I 'm scared ? Go to hell . Traitors . ( SPITS ) HARKEN : Nice . That 's why you 're not supposed to take that mask off . ( DOOR BUZZING ) WARDEN : Thank you , gentlemen . Please wait here while I get her transfer papers . I hate this place . Yeah , well , it 's part of the job . HARKEN : Just hold your nose and think about that government dental plan . Jamming pacifier chips in the back of people 's necks ? That 's not the job . That 's Night of the Living Dead . What else are we going to do ? These people are violent . And they have abilities . Lethal abilities . So at least this is humane . Humane ? Like the SPCA ? Alphas are rabid dogs now , is that it ? Megan Bates and her crew pulled off fifteen armed robberies , left five people dead . Now , she definitely belongs down here . All of these people down here have ... Gary ? It is Gary . Gary ! Guard ! CLAY : This is from the National Security Agency in Arlington , 10 days ago . HICKS : And you just found out about this ? CLAY : NSA won 't tell you what color the sky is without formal approval . We warned you about this when you sent him over there . Gary 's autistic . He 's got needs . He doesn 't like to be touched . Gary 's got a set routine , specific food , and he needs someone to listen to him talk about cars . I told them . Think they care ? He sent two of their agents to the hospital . They sent him here . End of story . ( SIGHING ) Hey , Dad . Oh , Dani . Hi . You 're early today . Yeah . Yeah , I am . Are you okay ? Yeah . It 's just this ... The level of sedation is just completely gratuitous . Let me help . ( SIGHING ) ( ELECTRICAL SPARKING ) Oh , thank you . Yeah , that 's a little bit better . ( SIGHING ) I think your visits are the only thing keeping me sane . So , how 's everything in your big , bad world ? ( CHUCKLING ) Um , Dad , according to your lawyers , the government is making you look pretty bad . They brought up the LSD bust , everything that mom said in the divorce papers ... Well , I worry them something fierce . They 'll do whatever it takes to discredit me . No , Dad , they 're calling it a history of mental illness . I don 't know if they 're ever going to let you out of here . No , Dani . They are going to . And soon , I think . How can you be so sure ? Because , try as they might , Dani , the government cannot cover up everything . Plus , there is Stanton Parish . Hmm ? Out there somewhere , planning God knows what . Sooner or later , there will be an event , or a series of events they simply cannot control without me . So that 's what I 'm waiting for . An event . MEDICAL TECHNICIAN : Okay , Ms. Bates , you 'll feel a little pinch . And running final diagnostic . ( WHIRRING ) Why don 't you just turn the chip off for 10 minutes ? Okay ? So we can find out what happened to our friend . WARDEN : There 's nothing that I can do . I understand , sir , but it 's our belief that Mr. Bell was simply mishandled . CLAY : He 's a valuable asset . So you shouldn 't have stuck a chip in his brain ! Yeah , not helping . MEDICAL TECHNICIAN : I 'm activating her chip now . ( WHIRRING ) Whoa ! Stop ! ( ALARM BUZZING ) Some kind of power surge ? ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ) MEDICAL TECHNICIAN : Cut the breaker ! Cut the breaker ! ( MEDICAL TECHNICIAN SCREAMING ) It 's Meg . When they chipped her , they let her in the whole damn system . They 'll all wake up . ( BEEPING ) ( MECHANICAL WHIRRING ) What is that ? What the hell is going on ? Power loss . Get the guards in . WARDEN : Lock these doors down . Both sides . GUARD ON PA : Code 1228 . Building Seven . Code 1228 . Building Seven . ( GASPING ) No . No . No . HARKEN : Gary . Gary . It 's me , Bill . Gary . GARY : No . Gary . It 's me , Bill . Gary ! HARKEN : Gary . GARY : No . No . HARKEN : Gary . Come on . Get up . Get up . GARY : No ! GARY : No ! No ! No ! MAN : We 've got a situation here ! ( MAN SCREAMING ) ( ALARM BLARING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( GROANING ) No , no , Gary ! Agent Harken . I remember you . You 've got a weak heart . I can stop that . ( HARKEN GROANING ) Gary . This is bad . We 've got to get out of here . ( ELECTRICAL WHIRRING ) ( HARKEN SIGHING ) Do you see signals ? Gary , I don 't think I can amp up . So , please tell me you see a way out . ( PANTING ) Come on , partner . ( GROANING ) Look . Okay , partner . I 'm gonna need you . Okay ? It 's time to step your game up . Step . Step your game up . All right , Gary ? MEG : Cornell ! Baby . I shorted out everything . But the fail-safe doors dropped . ( ALARM WAILING ) Let me in there . I can make a difference . Unless your ability misfires again . Someone turn off that damn alarm ! SCIPIO : Testing . Testing . One , two . Testing . Mic check . Sibilance . Sibilance . Hello . Cornell Scipio . Hello , Cornell . This is a formal negotiation , Agent Clay . You call me Mr. Scipio . We 're not negotiating . Release the hostages , or things will get worse . Worse than having a chip in my neck ? All right . You want to play hardball ? Asher ? Please . I have a family . ( GRUNTING ) I have a family , too . Don 't shoot . We can still talk about this . I 'm not going shoot him . Kimi ? My God . That 's Kimi Milard . ( WHISPERING INAUDIBLY ) ( SOBBING ) ( GUN CLICKING ) ( GUN COCKING ) Next time . Okay . We get the message . Mr. Scipio , what are your demands ? You know what ? I 'm actually done talking with you , Clay . There 's only one person I 'm willing to negotiate with . Doc , there 's been an incident . I 'll fill you in on the ride . No , Nathan . That 's not the way it 's going to work . You fill me in first . And then , if I decide to help , then we take that ride . ROSEN : ( ECHOING ) Rachel . Rachel ? Hi . Dr. Rosen . I never thought I 'd see you again . I know , but I 'm here now , and it 's because I need you . Which means you have to leave this room . Now , you 've been here before . You know what you have to do . Focus on the things that comfort you . Tune everything else out . Take a step forward . So I 'm thinking for dinner , there 's this little sushi place on Broadway . You like sushi , right ? What am I doing here ? I 'm supposed to be at work . No . ( ECHOING ) Right now , you 're supposed to be here with me . So , kiss me . Okay ? ( ECHOING ) Tell me I 'm beautiful . Oh , you 're beautiful . ROSEN : Nina . ( ECHOING ) Go home . What do you want ? Because I have things to do . Nina , Gary is in trouble , and he needs us . Gary , I should have never let Clay loan you out to the NSA . I know that now . I just thought I needed to do whatever it took to show that we were still valuable without Rosen . And I overstepped . ( SIGHING ) Hey , I 'm trying to apologize right now . Do you hear me ? Gary , do you hear ... Gary ! ( STAMMERING ) All right , that was too loud . I was dumb . I just ... I am sorry . ( ELECTRICAL WHIRRING ) He 's here . What ? Hey , Rach . Hicks . So , you came . I 'm here for Gary . Not you . Right . What happened between the two of you ? I woke up . Yeah , is that what you call pushing everyone you meet ? You need help . You feel like jumping off a building ? Please , the both of you . You can discuss how much you care about each other later . Right now , there are things I need each of you to do while I 'm out of contact . Out of contact ? Yes . If I 'm going to work with the people inside , I need to be inside . Doc , you know , you put a lot of these guys in there . And what if all they want to do is get their hands on you ? Huh ? Well , if that 's the case , this will all be over shortly . I 'll do what I can in there . And I 'll relay what I discover to the three of you via Rachel . But if for some reason , I can 't defuse the situation , then , Cameron ... Right . We play cavalry . Yes , at the right moment . And only if absolutely necessary . ( DOOR BUZZING ) ( DOOR BUZZING ) Rachel , I 'm in . ROSEN : ( ECHOING ) I don 't see anyone so far . But if I meet visible Alphas , I 'll let you know . It 's deserted . But I hear footsteps . I 'm here to talk . I 'm not . Hello , Ted . You asked me a lot of questions before you threw me in here . How I see weak spots . What they look like to me . Still curious ? ( GROANING ) That 's your radial nerve . Oh . Touchy , isn 't it ? I see Building Seven hasn 't diminished your abilities any . SCIPIO : Asher ! This man is our guest . I 'm sorry about that . Dr. Rosen . Cornell Scipio . I 'm a big fan . SCIPIO : Welcome to the monkey house . Plenty crowded , thanks to you . ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ) Hey , Dr. Rosen 's asking to see Bill and Gary . RACHEL : Scipio 's not going for it . ( DISTANT THUDDING ) There 's a banging . It 's faint , but it 's regular . Scipio 's voice just got angrier . He wants to know how Dr. Rosen can justify putting them in there , how they 've been treated . We are all still in Building Seven . We are rotting . ROSEN : Yes , I understand your frustration . You all are being treated deplorably . And I want to change that . That 's one of the main reasons I went public with the Alpha situation in the first place . That 's why I am here . I want ... I want to help . You want to help ? Okay . Tell me ... Tell us why we 're so screwed up . You are not screwed up . If anything , you are all extremely gifted . Come on . I set things on fire . I make people 's skin sizzle . Let 's face it , they 're never going to let us out of here . I 'm a mistake . We are all mistakes . " Maybe we all belong in a cage . " And here comes the line about how there are no mistakes . We 're all just people . Kumbaya . No . Actually , Dr. Rosen isn 't giving him any sympathy at all . " Your ability isn 't the mistake . " The mistake is how you choose to use it . Yes . And that 's what I wanted to talk to you about . What in my brain makes me different ? Can ... Hey , can I turn it off ? You really want to talk about this right now ? Yeah . I can 't hear a damn thing . I get up at 7 : 42 . What did you say ? I get up . I get up at 7 : 42 , brush my teeth and dress myself appropriately . Shirt and pants . You have to wear pants even if they 're uncomfortable . It 's important to wear pants when you leave the house . Right . It 's important to wear pants . And it 's important to interact with people . Right , Gary ? I get up at 7 : 42 . Brush my teeth , dress myself ... Gary . Okay . ( SIGHING ) Whenever you are stressed or you feel threatened , your sweat glands produce two chemicals that , when combined , combust . Oh , so I 'm combustible . That 's cute . Uh , actually , at the moment , you seem quite calm , despite your condition . Which strikes me as , um , a bit odd , given the situation we 're in right now . Is this a delaying tactic , Mr. Scipio ? No , no , no . My questions matter . Because if I 'm a mistake , and I can 't change that , where does that end ? A mistake isn 't human . A mistake is something else . A " them . " Us versus them . And I don 't get to choose whose side I 'm on . That , uh , sounds like something coming from Stanton Parish . Stanton Parish ? Where 's that ? Somewhere near Baton Rouge ? Baby ? We 're ready . Ready for what ? What 's going on ? I was right . This has all been a ruse . Listen to me , Cornell . There is no us or them . You are not a mistake . Thinking that way is the mistake . And you can prove it to yourself . You can prove your humanity . Just let these hostages go , and I promise ... You know what , Rosen ? I 've enjoyed our little chat . But , um ... It 's time for the main event . HICKS : Where is he taking them ? Whoa , what happened ? All right . It 's time . Guys , I 've got to get inside . Hey ! HICKS : Hey ! Go ! Now ! Move ! Move ! Move ! Time 's up . RACHEL : What are they doing ? Oh , my God . Somebody has got to stop him . ( GUNSHOT FIRING ) ( BOTH GASPING ) Oh , my ... Hicks . They just shot a guard ! Oh , my God . Okay . No , no , no . ROSEN : You can 't do this . I can do all sorts of things . Okay . Go , go , go . No ! ( SCREAMING ) Oh , my God . ( STAMMERING ) We need an ambulance . We need , uh , the paramedics ! ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ) It 's wrong . It 's all wrong . What are you talking about ? I don 't smell the burning , okay ? The yelling , the screaming , it 's only on the monitors . You okay ? I 'm okay . Hicks . Hicks , can you hear me ? RACHEL : It 's all fake . CLAY : We 're clear . It 's fake . Rachel 's saying it 's all fake . RACHEL : Hicks , I 'm hearing something upstairs . Come on . This way ! HICKS : Move , move , move . Let 's go ! CLAY : She hacked into the security feed . She faked the whole thing . Painted a picture with the ones and zeros to lure us in here . ( GASPING ) Where 'd they go ? ( PANTING ) Too late . You lose . Hicks , I 'm still hearing the banging . Ted Asher . He , uh , he finds the weak spots . Right ? Rachel , where is that banging coming from ? It 's the south-east corner . He was punching his way out . Come on . Move ! ( INDISTINCT SHOUTING ) ( INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ) ( GROANING ) It 's not going to do you any good . Just be quiet ! ( GUNSHOT FIRING ) Not you . You 're not one of us . ( GROANING ) ( SCREAMING ) Rachel , Rachel , look at me . Okay ? ( SOBBING ) ( ECHOING ) You 're not scared . You are completely focused . Cornell , let Bill and Gary go . You don 't need them . You don 't need hostages anymore . You 've proved your humanity already . I 'm not human . I 'm an Alpha . Please don 't do this ! Doc ! Doc ! Cameron . They 've taken Bill and Gary . You 've got to stop them , Cameron . Which one ? GARY : I get up at 7 : 42 . I get up at 7 : 42 . I get up at 7 : 42 . I swear to God . Shut him up . He doesn 't shut up in the back of the car . Second from the front . They 're in the backseat . Take the shot , Hicks . Cameron , it 's just like throwing a quarter . Just like throwing a quarter . ( GUNSHOT FIRING ) God . No . RACHEL : Bill ! ( COUGHING ) Gary ! ( POLICE SIREN WAILING ) RACHEL : Gary . Thank God . Lie down , lie down , lie down . Bill , deep breaths . Deep breaths , Bill . Good job , Bill . ( PANTING ) Good shot , Hicks . ( PANTING ) Asher 's out cold . Where 's Scipio ? Rachel ? He 's gone . ( PANTING ) ROSEN : Let 's face it , Nathan . You can 't control the Alpha 's situation . You haven 't found Parish yet . And you or whoever else is in charge can 't cover this up forever . For the past eight months , you 've been fighting a losing battle . Look , what happened in Building Seven , it was bad . But those hostages came out alive . You and your team made that happen . Yeah , we did what we could . Listen , why don 't you just tell me what you want to tell me ? We need you . We need you to pull your team back together , deal with the Building Seven escapees , and keep a lid on this entire mess . Well , why didn 't the government think of that before they institutionalized me ? The government is a hundred thousand feudal kingdoms all fighting for money and control . Sure , you 've got some enemies in DC , but you 've got some friends , too . And what are these friends offering me ? A full pardon . A cause . A fat consulting fee . It will be just like the old days . ( LAUGHING ) Ah , you know , there 's a reason they call them " the old days . " It 's because they are old . Lee , I got you a sweet deal here . Take it , or you 'll end up back in your rubber room . All right . So if you or whomever wants me back , I need to run the program . I decide what happens to the Alphas we locate . I approve of the assignments , and there 's no interference . Or I 'm out . RACHEL : Hey , Gary . My mom 's hummus . Your favorite . Rachel , he 's not a dog . Okay ? He doesn 't respond to treats . Dogs don 't like hummus . Do they , Gary ? I thought you said he was talking . Yeah , he was . You know , Gary babble . But after the crash , not a peep . I figured if you bring him to his familiar surroundings , he 'd feel something , or ... Maybe he just needs some time . Okay ? Just to get adjusted . Come on , Gary . Gary , come on . Look . Gary . Come on , now . Look around you . All right ? Look . Everybody 's here . You 're back at work . What do you do ? You greet your coworkers appropriately . Right ? So , come on . Come on . Greet me . Come on , you bastard . Greet me . Look , I 'll let you drive . Bill , you 're on the right track . Still , uh , may I ? He 's all yours . Gary , I understand why you 're not greeting everyone . Greetings usually happen at 9 : 00 a.m. So now , it is 3 : 14 . Now , we 're not on a case . What do you usually do around 3 : 14 ? Okay , this is hopeless . He 's exactly the same way as he was when ... Don 't say that . HARKEN : Wait . Wait , wait . He just . He just looked at me . Did you see that ? ROSEN : Gary , let 's imagine today . All right ? You got up at 7 : 42 . You brushed your teeth , as usual . And then , you got dressed . You know , shirt , socks , shoes , pants . Right ? You 've got to wear pants . Right . Because that 's important . Right ? And then , you , uh , went downstairs , you got breakfast , and then you came in . And you greeted everyone . Um , and then , you worked , you had lunch and now , it is , uh ... Well , you 've been here all day . So , what do you normally do then ? She 's worried about you , Gary . She hasn 't heard from you . What are you going to do ? ( DIALING ) This is Sandra Bell . Leave a message . It 's the voice-mail . I hate the voice-mail . ( BEEPS ) Mom , I 'm at the office . And I 'm fine . I don 't have a chip in my head anymore . Okay , bye . Gary . Uh . No , don 't do that . I know . I know . I didn 't mean to . My personal space . I know . I know . Too bad . Because here comes another one . No . Get off me . Get off . You called me a bastard . That 's not nice . You tell him , Gary . Yeah . Bill , you know what ? You 're the bastard . You 're right . You left me with NSA . And they made me spy on my friends . And then they wouldn 't answer when I greeted them appropriately . And they put me in Building Seven , Bill . And you just left me there . You all left me there . Yes , Gary . Uh , that 's right . I did . And that was a mistake . Yeah . A mistake . But now , we are going to make it right . All of us . Together . We , uh , we stored a few things in your office while you were gone . I 'm going to help you get them out . All right ? Thanks . Wait . Hicks , why are you ... What kinds of things ? Smelly things ? Hicks ? I 'm glad to have you back . Yeah . No , don 't do that . I don 't like that . Too bad . Stanton . It 's a little dramatic , don 't you think ? Holding a meeting in the wasteland ? Sentimental , actually . I marched through here during the war . It was orchards , then . All the way to the river . And now , it 's a pit . People really do screw everything up , don 't they ? The smokestack has ever waged war on the apple tree . We 'll put an end that . Better people , better world . How 's your father ? He 's free . Like you said . I just got the call . Good . Such injustice , him rotting away in there . I 'm glad that he can benefit from our efforts . ( SIGHING ) Still , miles to go before we sleep . Let 's get to work .

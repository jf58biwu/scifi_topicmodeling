 This is what Destiny intended from the moment it entered the star system . We are going to survive , we are going to make it home . I 'm telling you , the ship came here for a reason ! This ship is powered by the stars themselves . He and Young are bumping heads , yes . Not sure which camp is the better choice . We just pretend nothing happened . We need to be ready for the next encounter . For the sake of the crew . For the sake of the crew . Dad , no , wait ! You know , the Icarus project is something your father truly believed in . A son ? What 's his name ? Matthew . The few times I was conscious , they were probing my mind . It 's something I 'd rather not think about , really . There a reason your radio 's off ? What , you couldn 't find a broom closet ? What are you doing ? I should go . What ? Why ? I can 't be doing this . Right . You say that now that you 're done . You knew what you were getting into . You know what ? No . Screw that . I am not going to let you kick me aside like you did before . Yeah , well , whatever . Move . Me or her . You can 't have both . I never said I wanted both . Now , move . Me or her , Matt ... Get out of my way . Oh , for ... Start to Dr. Volker . Anybody in the control interface room ? How about anybody at all ? Hello ? Anybody ? You okay ? Yeah , the door control doesn 't work . No , you don 't have to ... Stupid ship . Where is everybody ? I don 't know . The room was empty when I got here . Can I help you with something ? What are you doing ? Nothing you need to worry about . I like to worry . I was just updating some personnel files . In the gateroom . Colonel Young and Dr. Rush know all about it , in case you 'd like to talk to them . I 'll do that . Greer ... have you seen Matt ? I have not . Lieutenant James , come in ! Lieutenant James , this is Colonel Young . Please respond . Yes , sir . You 're late with the current ammunition count . Lieutenant , what are you doing ? Nothing , sir . I 'm fine . I am ... I just lost track of time , but I 'm on my way now . James out . So I heard that Colonel Young 's calling off the search for Franklin . It 's not like anyone was really lookin ' for him . The man just vanished . Weird . Dunning ... Come on . What the hell ? Dr. Volker ? You okay ? Something weird 's going on here . What is it ? You look ... tired . Maybe you should go lie down . Yeah . Maybe I will . Matthew ? Nicholas . Hi . Something wrong ? I need to talk to you , about something that hap ... Just the two I need to see . Colonel . Am I interrupting something ? No . Good . I wasn 't even in the gateroom today . He said it was empty ? Only person in the room was Wray , working at one of the consoles , updating the files . Said you told him that Rush and I knew all about it . No , I don 't know anything about this . And I don 't know what to tell you , Colonel , other than he 's lying . He has no reason to lie . Please . Sergeant Greer has had it in for us since the first day we came aboard this ship ... Correction . Since the day the two of you led a mutiny to take it over . I can understand his suspicion . I was not in the gateroom . Hey ! Are you all right ? You didn 't pass anyone in the corridor just now ? No . Oh , my ... Matt , what happened ? We need help in the work-out room ! Anyone from the military , as many as possible ! Now ! Get it out ! Oh , my God ! Get it out ! Get it out ! He thinks a snake is crawling under his skin . Get it out ! A snake ? He said it was crawling around under his skin , but no one saw anything . He just ... flipped out . I can 't find anything physically wrong with him other than the wounds that he inflicted on himself . Have you noticed any unusual behavior from him lately ? No , he 's been his normal self . As far as I can tell . All right , well , let 's ... let 's keep him here , close eye on him and let me know when the sedatives wear off . I want to talk to him . No warning or anything ? He just ... just went nuts ? Yeah . Some kind of nervous breakdown . It was pretty scary . Tearing gashes in your own arms ? That 's ... that 's intense . The stress of life on this ship ? Day after day of not knowing what 's ahead ? It 's a wonder more people aren 't cracking up . I 'm just glad he took it out on himself . And didn 't start shooting people . Hey , you all right ? Hello ? Earth to Greer ? I 'm fine . I always figured he 'd be the first to snap . Sergeant Greer ? If you want to accuse me of something , come forward . No need for spying . Who you talking to ? Apparently no one . No ... No ! Help ! Someone help me , please ! Get me out of here ! Wait ! Get me out of here ! Well , where the hell is she ? I don 't know , sir . I tried to radio her . She 's not responding . Oh , for God 's sake ... Lieutenant James , come in ! Lieutenant James , this is Colonel Young . Please respond . James ! I 'm so sorry . You can 't be real . Why did you leave me ? Lieutenant Scott . Yeah , Colonel , go ahead . I need you in the infirmary . You 're alive ? She thinks she killed you . How did you ... you were in my room . You 're hallucinating . Just like airman dunning . What the hell is going on here ? We don 't know yet . I can 't find anything physically wrong with either one of them . I 'm seeing things too . Hallucinations . My son . I keep seeing him on the ship . I just ... I just talked to him . Your away team . James and dunning went off-world with you to the last planet . Maybe they picked something up . We didn 't ingest anything that ... It could 've been airborne , any number of possibilities . Corporal Barnes was on the away team as well . So was Dr. Volker . Help ! Oh , please , somebody help me ! Colonel , we got him . Nothing ? No . No weird things out of the corner of your eye ? Disorientation ? No . Feeling pretty much the way I always do . Hungry , tired , but I 'm not seeing things . Maybe she 's immune to whatever it is the others picked up . Maybe her symptoms are just taking longer to show up . Thanks . But physically , they 're okay ? So far as I can tell , yeah . No , he 's doing fine , but I 'm going to quarantine the entire away team . Hopefully isolate the hallucinations until they pass . What if they don 't pass ? What if it gets worse ? I 'm sure whatever it is , TJ 'll figure it out . I mean , she 's done pretty damn good so far . Is there anything I can do ? No . No , I 'll pass the word . I 'll let everyone know what 's going on , but the situation 's been contained , so there 's no need for anybody to get alarmed . As soon as I know anything ... Colonel Young , come in ! Yeah , TJ . Can you come to the infirmary ? I just discovered something . You see ? So , it 's difficult to see , which is why I missed it on my initial examination . You see right there ? Yeah , it looks like a tick . Yeah , I just checked the others . They all have one , same spot , top of the neck there . All except corporal Barnes . She 's clear . Welcome to our new galaxy . So , the ticks are causing the hallucinations ? I don 't know for sure , but I think so . Maybe they inject a venom , some sort of toxin that affects the brain 's chemistry . Okay , I want out . Please , just get me out of here . I want out of here , TJ . Okay , okay , just relax , okay ? Can you remove it ? They seem similar to earth ticks . I could try and remove it the same way . You up for going first ? Okay . Lieutenant Scott ? What happened ? I don 't know . He 's crashing . Let 's start CPR . He 's breathing . He 's back . All right . Did we get it ? We remove it ? It 's dug itself in even deeper . His pulse is normal . BP 's back in range . Listen ... is removing them impossible ? No . It 's just that when I tried to pull it off , it must have released more toxin . I just have to figure out another way . Get to it . Hello ? Hello , sweetheart . It 's all right . It 's really me . No ... no , you 're ... you 're not real . Chloe ... Oh , God ! No , this isn 't happening . Chloe . Look at me . Whether I 'm real or not , aren 't you ... at least happy to see your old man ? I have missed you , sweetheart . I 've missed you so much . So , where do you want to put ' em ? If we do this , then we could ... Hey ! What 's going on here ? What do you mean ? We 're just talking . About what ? Is something bothering you , Sergeant ? I don 't know . Should there be ? If you 've got something to say , why don 't you just go ahead and say it ? You 're not taking over this ship again . We 've no intentions of doing so . You 're being paranoid . I know you 're up to something . And you have proof of this , do you ? Of course you don 't . Are we done here ? We haven 't had any luck yet figuring out a way home . God knows if we ever will . We do have the communication stones . I was able to use them to go see mom . How is she ? Strong . Fragile . Doing her best , considering . She 's a fighter . Like you . Sometimes I see you in my dreams . But they always end the same . I 'm trying to get through this , but it just gets so ... Hey . One step at a time . Look at that view . God , I 've never seen anything like it . I always dreamed that you would live a life of adventure . Travel the world . I know . You told me frequently . Well , look at you now . Sailing through the universe , exploring galaxies and planets . You 're living my dream , kiddo . Hey , what do you got ? The venom we extracted from the jungle planet creature . It worked as an anesthetic on Rush during his surgery . I think that if I apply it topically to the tick ... Knock it out , give you time to remove it . That 's great . Oh , he 's coming to . What happened ? You got a jolt when we tried to remove the tick . Relax , just relax . We 're going to try to anesthetize it , and then I 'll try and see if I can remove it safely , okay ? Okay , let 's just take a look here . It 's gone . The tick . It just died off ? I don 't know . Theirs are both still attached . Volker as well . Could it have jumped ? Yeah , no , I remember . Gosh , that 's so funny , I feel like that was forever ago . Hey . What are you doing ? What 's wrong ? Chloe ? I 'm fine . Really ? 'Cause you don 't seem fine . My father 's here . I mean , I ... I know he 's not ... here . I 'm just ... Just ... hallucinating ? It 's really strange . He 's so ... real . You 're seeing him right now ? - Yes . - Where ? Right beside me . Hello , Mr. Wallace . He can 't hear you . Okay . Chloe ... We 've got to get you to the infirmary , just have TJ take a look ... No , I already know what 's wrong . There 's a tick on me . Matt and his team picked them up on the last planet . One must have jumped to me somehow ... Wait a minute , what ? An alien tick ? Are you kidding me ? TJ thinks it might inject some kind of toxin that causes people to hallucinate ... Look , we have to go ... - No ! No , wait ! - Chloe ... It doesn 't hurt . That 's not the point ... And he 's not hurting me either . He ? You mean your imaginary father ? I 'm not crazy . I know what 's going on . I know that he 's not real , but I can 't ... I 'm not ready to lose him again , okay ? You can 't let that thing stay on you . I know , okay ? I know . Just ... humor me , all right ? Give me some time ? I 'll go see TJ soon , I promise , but for now , just ... Don 't tell anyone , okay ? Please , Eli . Okay , Sergeant , I 've ... I don 't see anything . You 're clear , too . What happened to it ? Listen , I want you to go back to your quarters , and stay there until ... No . Just a precaution , make sure nothing happens . Cole can take over for you . No , Colonel , please , I 'm fine . Look , we 'll check ourselves periodically , and if I start having any hallucinations , then ... Chloe . She was in here earlier . I 'll go find her . Ready ? Okay ? Colonel Young , come in ! Colonel Young , do you read ? Eli ... Hey . Are you okay ? I heard you ... I 'm fine . Have you seen Chloe ? Eli ? Yeah . Matt ... Hey , I need you to come with me to the infirmary . There 's a chance that the tick that was on me jumped to you . Have you been seeing any weird things ? No . I 'm fine ... Chloe . She 's seeing her dad . Eli ! We need to get you to the infirmary . No , just wait a minute . I just need a little more time ... We can 't risk letting that thing stay on you . Don 't leave me , Chloe ! No . Wait ! I 'm not ... Come on , Chloe , Chloe ? Come on ! Come on . It 'll be okay . Can I help you with something , Sergeant ? You can start by wiping that smile off your face . What smile ? I 'd appreciate you not telling lies about me to Colonel Young . Lies . Telling him that I was in the gateroom , messing with the consoles . I don 't know what kind of game you 're playing , Sergeant , but ... What are you doing ? There it is . I don 't know why you have to remove it . It 's not hurting me . You don 't know that . It 's making you hallucinate . Who knows what else it 's doing . It 's too dangerous to leave in place . Guys , this discussion needs to end now . Let 's remove it . Tell your mother that I love her . I miss her . I love you , daddy . I love you , too , sweetheart . You 're living our dream . Remember that . Colonel Young , come in ! Go ahead , Sergeant . Colonel Young , we have a problem . The civilians are trying to take over the ship again . What ? I 'm pursuing Rush . He and Wray are actively trying to seize control of the ship . Now , I don 't know who else is working with them , sir , but we need to mobilize now . Sergeant , I need you to listen to me . Do not do anything . I will talk to them . Permission to use deadly force . What ? No , did you hear what I said ? I need you to stand down . Do not do anything . Permission granted . Use whatever force necessary to stop them . Copy that . Sergeant , we don 't know if these channels have been compromised . Go to radio silence . Yes , sir . Greer , acknowledge . I said stand down . You think he might be hallucinating too ? How ? All the ticks have been accounted for . Unless there was more than one tick on each of you when you guys got back . Go find Greer . Yes , sir . We need to examine everyone on this ship . Quarantine anyone who 's clear . Yes , sir . Sergeant Greer ... I know you 're in here , Rush . Show yourself ! No ! What are you doing ? Open that door ! You 're not taking over the ship again . Colonel Young , come in ! Go ahead , Scott . No sign of Greer . Still not responding to any radio calls . All right , well , keep at it . Sir , Rush and Wray are also unaccounted for . No one knows where they are . Rush isn 't responding to his radio , either . All right . I 'll put a few more details together . TJ ... Excuse me . So , listen , I got to go help look for Greer . You going to be okay ? Yeah , fine . But if you feel any different , see anything out of the usual ... No , believe me , I 'm as concerned about this as you are . Fine , fine . Keep me posted . Yeah . Thanks . More than one tick attached to you would explain why some of the hallucinations were more ... intense than others . The toxins , maybe they target the limbic system . It 's the area of the brain that 's responsible for emotion . So , fear , anger , remorse ... Matt 's guilt over his son . Claustrophobia . My dad . Let me guess , issue with snakes ? And you ? Listen to me ... I can 't stop the bleeding . You have to open that door . If I don 't get medical attention ... Yes , Colonel . No , sir , I do not know who else is involved in the mutiny . She 's refusing to cooperate . You 're not talking to anyone . Your radio is off ! What is the matter with you ? Yes , I will continue the interrogation , but at some point , sir , we are just better off ending this once and for all . Sergeant ... Sergeant , listen to me . Sergeant Greer ! We are not taking over the ship ! What do you got ? Can 't get the door open . Must have been disabled from the inside . I heard Wray 's voice . Camile ? It 's Lieutenant Scott ! Scott , help ! I 'm wounded ! Sergeant Greer has got us hostage ... Shut ... Quiet , now . Sergeant Greer , it 's Lieutenant Scott ! Stand down ! Colonel Young , this is Scott , come in . Yeah . We found him . He has locked himself and Wray in one of the storage rooms . I think he 's holding her hostage . That 's it . I 'm done with you . Please ... Sergeant ... Don 't . Do it . I said do it . Colonel Young ... Colonel , we got ' em . Send TJ . We ... we have wounded in here . How you doing ? Okay . I was able to stop the bleeding and stitch the wound , so we 'll keep an eye out for infection , but ... She should be okay . The rest of the crew ? I checked everyone . It looks like we got ' em all , so ... Hopefully things will get back to normal around here . Whatever that is . What do we got ? Well , the atmosphere is good . 10 hours on the countdown . Shall we send a team ? Yeah . Our luck 's got to change at some point . Just remember the bug spray . Scott , this is Young . Get a team ready . You 're going off-world .

 Understand this , Erik . These Nazi 's , I 'm not like them . Genes are the key , yes ... But their goals ? Blue eyes , Blonde hair , Pathetic . Eat the chocolate . It 's good . Want some ? I want to see my Mama . Genes are the keys that unlocks the door to a new age , Erik . A new future for mankind . Evolution . You know what I 'm talking about ? It 's a simple thing I ask of you . A little coin is nothing compared to a big gate . Is it ? I tried it Doctor ... I can 't ... do it . It 's impossible . The one good thing I can say about the Nazi 's - is that their methods produce results . I 'm sorry , Erik . Mama ! My darling . How are you ? Here 's what we 're going to do : I 'm going to count to three and you 're going to move the coin . You don 't move the coin , I pull the trigger . Understand ? One ... - Mama ! - You can do it . Two ... Everything is all right . Everything is all right . Everything is all right ! Three . Yes , wonderful ! Excellent ! No ! Outstanding , Erik ! So we unlock your gift with anger . Anger and pain . You and me , we 're going to have a lot of fun together . Possession of that gold is illegal . - I should inform the police . - Let 's not play this game . Where did you get it ? A Friend . He recommended your bank , most highly . I see . Do you know our terms , sir ? Yes . And you should know mine . This gold is what remains of my people . Melted from their possessions . Torn from their teeth . This is blood money . And you 're going to help me find the bastards responsible for it . Don 't touch that alarm . I want Schmidt , Klaus Schmidt . - Where is he ? - Our clients don 't supply addresses , we 're not ... Not that sort of bank ? Metal fillings , eh , not gold . Worried someone might steal them ? Argentina ! Schmidt is in Argentina ! Villa Gesell ! Please , please ! Thank you . I would love to kill you . So mark my words , if you warn anyone , I 'm coming I will find you . - Good evening , my friends ! - Good evening ! - Hot , no ? - Yes ... One beer , please . - German beer . - Of course . Yes , it 's Bitburger . You like it ? The best . What brings you to Argentina ? The climate , I 'm a pig farmer . Tailor , since I was a boy . My father made the finest suits in Düsseldorf . My Parents were from , Düsseldorf . - What was their name ? - They didn 't have a name . It was taken away from them by pig farmers and tailors . " Blood and Honour " . Which would you care to shed first ? - We were under orders . - Blood then . - Freeze , asshole ! - Come on , shoot ! Who , what are you ? Hello . Once again , my sympathies for your treatment at the hands of the CIA . These American 's are ruthless . Now they have their missiles placed in Turkey . I expect you 'll be planning new missile sites of your own . Somewhere where you know the American early warning system won 't help . I hear Cuba is lovely this time of year . And so close to Florida . Missiles in Cuba ? ha ha You 're serious ? We may as well declare war . It 's nothing . Captain , no sign of any American ships . Maintain course , full ahead . Dear comrades . The United States have dispatched war ships for Cuba . This leaves us with no choice . Comrade First Secretary . We must send in our fleet . Dispatch the fleet ! Captain , we already have our orders . Why so eager for new ones ? I 've lived through one war , comrade . I 'd prefer not to start another . Battle stations , NOW ! Fleet reports all weapons ready . From the Kremlin , sir . New orders . As of 1025 hours , the cargo vessel Aral sea , is hereby ordered to reverse course and return to port in Odessa . Aral Sea , come in . Aral Sea , come in . They are not responding . She 's not turning around . Aral Sea , you are ordered to turn around . Do not cross the line . Aral Sea , you are ordered to turn around . No ! Congratulations , comrade . You just averted a Nuclear war . What ? Take him to the brig . What ? What just happened ? Fire . Fire . Subs by voodoo

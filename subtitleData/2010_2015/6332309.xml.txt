 ( CLUCKING ) Shh . ( MAN OVER RADIO ) It 's a beautiful summer day in Chicago today . Temperatures expected to reach the upper 80s . In recent news , a health advisory was reported from Happy Poultry Farms . They 're telling us they 're issuing a full recall for their pre-cooked chicken tenders and also their buffalo chicken tenders . This only applies to chicken that was packaged Friday and delivered to Fort Chicken and Danville . ( WOMAN ) Morning , honey . - Ahem . Rise and shine . - Morning , Mum . - How 's the book going ? Good . Yeah , I 've been working really hard on it . Rewriting it . It 's a first draught , you know . Did you get a chance - to read the manuscript ? - I did and I loved it . - Oh . Any thoughts ? Criticisms ? - No , I thought it was wonderful . I won 't become a better writer if I don 't get constructive criticism . Please . - I 'm begging you . - Well , um , I did think the characters were a tiny bit unlikeable . - That 's more like it . Noted . - And it was a little slow . I found myself a little bored , to be honest . - And I heart honesty . - I also didn 't know what was going on or where we were . It wasn 't explained well . I couldn 't figure out the plot . It was kind of insulting . And there was no specificity in terms of time and place . - And where was the inciting incident ? - OK , OK , this is ... Wow . Thank you , heh . But mostly I loved it . Now , get up and teach those summer school kids how to write like you . Chapter one . The boat was evil , but he loved the boat . Chapter one . The boat was evil , but he didn 't know just how evil . The boat was evil , but it was an acceptable level of evil . Chapter one . The sea-faring vessel , The Schooner , was evil . Ah . It 's getting there . Jesus . I 've come full circle . How very , very utterly depressing . What 's up , amigo ? Hey . - You 're not my dealer . - No , I 'm Clint ... - Hey , you don 't sell shrooms do you ? - No . I 'm Clint Hadson . ( MAN OVER RADIO ) Is that Hudson ? - Hadson . - Yeah , it 's him . I 'll let him in . - Oh . So that 's a no on the shrooms ? - Right . ( COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ) ( CAR DOOR LOCK BLEEPS ) ( CLINT ) Excuse me . I 'm having trouble ... ( CLINT GRUNTING ) ( WOMAN ) Don 't you forget , you 're grounded . When school 's over you come straight home . - Fuck you , Mum . - ( WOMAN ) Oh , yeah ? Fuck you . - I 'm just gonna miss you so much . - Can 't I take it off ? No . The playground is a war zone . ( GIRL GASPS ) - Watch it . - Sorry . Didn 't see you there . Well , maybe you should take in your surroundings more . Yeah . - Mr. Hudson . - ( CLINT ) Hadson . - Hi . Uh , call me Clint . - Righteous . Thanks for coming on such short notice . Mrs. Kenner is down with the flu , or maybe she 's pregnant . She is Mormon , so that 's a possibility . I 'm vice principal Simms . Principal Hodges is in the Bahamas . You know what they say . When the cat 's away , the vice principal becomes acting principal . I forgot they say that . ( SIMMS ) Teacher 's lounge is across the way . Go get a cup of joe . It 's not strong enough for my taste . To deal with these terrors I need the high-octane stuff . Isn 't that right ? Heh , she 's hilarious . A lot of personal tragedy . Come on in to this office . Pull up a ball chair . Got a cell phone ? Um , yeah . - I 'm gonna have to take it . - Are you serious ? Yep . This is a no cell-phone campus . We can 't ask the kids to give up something we 're not willing to . So hand over that crackberry . Booyah . Now , I gotta warn you , I run a pretty tight ship . Yeah , I 'm fine with that . Heh , it 's funny you should say that . I 'm actually writing a book about a ship . Well , it 's more of a boat . I have it with me . If you 're asking me to describe my pedagogical " philosophy " - I 'm not . - Some charter schools out of Boston are " absolutely " " revolutionising " " education . " I 'm not sure you know how air quotes work . I wanna bring these kids back to a pre-digital era . No cell phones , and I don 't care if it 's raining labradoodles , I wanna get those kids outside during recess . Heck , I 'll lock them out . And I will do that . Now , here 's a map of the school . Mrs. Kenner is in Room 12 . Oh , I don 't need that . I actually used to go here . Class of ' 88 . Hey , you know what that is ? That 's out of sight . - All right . - Shouldn 't joke about guns though . - No . - Not in a school . - Yeah . - That 's not funny . My partner 's name is David . He is awesome . He 's a little bit older , but really has this amazing body . If I 'm being completely honest , he does have these fantastic balls that I just love to play with . They 're firmer and fuzzier , so ... Heh , tennis partner . Heh , David 's my tennis partner . Heh . Hi there . Um , you know which one of these is Mrs. Kenner 's ? Buddy , I don 't know what that bitch drinks out of . Here 's what I do know . I know that this is a rape button . It emits a shit-crazy alarm that will inform local police , who 'll arrive within two minutes should you decide to get touchy and / or feely . Wanna know why I have a rape button ? Don 't answer . Because the State of Illinois doesn 't trust the citizenry enough to pass safe , sensible , conceal and carry laws . OK . So any of these then ? ( SIGHS ) Hm . She 's a little tightly wound , huh ? ( DOOR OPENS ) Oh , my God . Lucy ? Lucy McCormick ? - It 's Clint Hadson . - Oh , my God . - Wow , what are you doing here ? - I 'm subbing for Mrs. Kenner . Oh , my God . Amazing . I heard you lived in New York . Yeah , I did . In Brooklyn . But now I 'm in town for a while . Staying at Charman 's . Oh . - Who 's Charman ? - My mum . ( CHUCKLES ) But it 's the guesthouse , so it 's ... So you 're a teacher now ? No . Well , I mean yes . I subbed a little in New York , but I 'm a writer . That 's great . ( SCOFFS ) God , it 's a scorcher out there , huh ? Unseasonably warm . Yeah . Uh , Wade , have you met Clint ? I have not . Wade Johnson . Pleased to meet you with meat to please you . Actually , we kind of met earlier . You parked me in . - What are you talking about ? - Nothing . It 's ... It 's fine . It 's just that , um , you parked so close that I couldn 't get out of my car . My truck 's got a dual real wheel . - I 'm sorry ? - Dual real wheel . Dual real ... Dual real ... Dual real real . Dual real ... Dual real wheel . Dual real ... Real real . It 's got a dual real wheel . Dual real wheel . Dual real ... - Dual real . - I don 't understand . It 's got two extra wheels on the back part of it . Dual rear ... So , Clint , heard tell you were a writer , hmm ? - What have you written ? - Ah . Nothing that you 've read , yet . I 'm actually working on my first novel . - Really ? - Yeah . Oh , yeah , well , that 's actually why I 'm home . You know , just to hunker down and bang out that story . But , uh , I need a few shekels . ( LAUGHS ) Shekels . - Hebrew for ... - Doug . ... currency . Yeah . OK . - Wow . Good for you . That 's so exciting . - Thanks . What 's it about ? Oh . Uh , well , it 's a horror novel . Um , it 's about a guy who buys a boat , but the boat turns out to be possessed . Like Christine . - I 'm sorry ? - Christine by Stephen King . The guy buys a car and it 's possessed . - Um , but this is about a boat . - So it 's like Speed 2 ? Starring ... ? Sandra Bullock , yes , of course , and ... - Keanu Reeves ? - Jason Patric . - I am the biggest Jason Patric fan . - Jason Patric , heh . - Lost Boys . Kiefer . - " They 're not lost , they 're vampires . " ( ALL CHUCKLING ) - They got lost . - All right . Let 's roll . ( BELL RINGS ) Your classroom is actually right next to mine . I can walk you if you want . Um , yeah . That would be great . You are so fucking ugly . If my butthole had a butthole , that 's what you 'd look like . Yeah , you look like my butthole 's ass . BOY 1 : You look like you got chicken pox . If chicken pox was made out of haemorrhoids . Yeah , if chicken pox was made out of my ass . And here we are . Fourth grade , that 's me , heh . And you 're right up there . Good luck . Holler if you need anything . Or you can ask Wade . The athletic office is right down there . Yeah , what 's with that guy ? He seems like a bit of a dick . Heh . He 's my boyfriend . Sorry , I 'm late . I was helping a friend out . Eric , what is that ? You just put that right down now . Hey , did somebody order a sub ? Tough crowd , heh . ( BELL RINGS ) My uncle 's cancer took his stomach . But his divorce took his mind . Anyhoo ... That was my weekend . Let 's begin class . Maybe we were created by an all-knowing God who sent down his only son to die for us , or maybe we were monkey people who sat around crapping in each other 's mouths until one day we were like : " I don 't like all this hair . Just on my head and crotch , please . " Who can say ? I can 't , because the State of Illinois doesn 't allow me to , Hank . I know I 'm the substitute , but I 'm also a friend . It wasn 't so long ago that I was sitting exactly where you are . In fact , don 't tell those other teachers , but I want you to call me by my first name . - " Cunt " ? - What ? No . You can 't say ... OK , no . Uh , my name is Clint . You know what ? Just call me Mr. Hadson . I 'm not really a teacher . I 'm only substituting to pay the bills . I 'm actually writing a horror novel . Pretty cool , huh ? Yeah , real cool , asshole . ( CHILDREN CHUCKLING ) - Excuse me ? What 's your name ? - Patriot . - He got held back . - Shut up . Your name is Patriot ? That 's right . I was born on September 11th . God sent me on that day . That 's why on my 18th birthday , I 'm joining the Marines just to kick some towel-head ass . Wow . A lot to unpack there . First off , could you keep the language down , please ? Otherwise , I 'll send you outside . Yeah , while you were talking , I just looked at like a hundred vaginas . - All right . Give me that . - Why ? You 're not allowed to have it . Your principal told me . How about I start crying and suggest to my parents about how you touched me inappropriately ? Wait . You didn 't happen to write on a Prius this morning , did you ? OK . So I actually have the first draught of my new novel with me . Who would like to come up here and read the first chapter ? And then you guys can give me some notes . - Great . What 's your name ? - Ahem . Douche . - Calvin . - Calvin , come on down . Go ahead . " Chapter one . Trent always loved boats , but when he spent his life savings on the Anna Marie , he didn 't know he 'd just charted a course to evil . It was an easy money transaction ... " You 'd be good in a horror novel . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Hey . You listening to me ? ( ALL SCREAMING ) ( GROANING ) All right . Everyone calm down . Stay here . I 'm gonna take Patriot to the nurse . Come on . Come on . Don 't be a baby . Come on , Patriot . Let me see . Come on . ( NURSE ) This is going to need stitches . There 's nothing I can do about it here . - He 's gonna have to go to the hospital . - That 's OK . Patriot can handle it . Right , Patriot ? You 're a Marine . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Beautiful , beautiful shrooms . ( PSYCHEDELIC MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ) So one of my students tried to eat another one 's face off . How 's your day going ? I 'm really sorry about this morning . - What happened ? - Uh , I called your boyfriend a dick . I didn 't know you guys were dating and now I feel awkward . No , in your classroom . What happened ? Oh . This girl went ape-shit on this kid . She was biting him . - I sent him to the nurse . - Did you send her to the principal ? You kidding ? I wanted to give her a high-five . That kid 's a dick . ( CHILDREN CHATTERING ) ( BOY ) Hey . You bit my friend 's face . ( GIRL BREATHING HEAVILY ) What , are you sick or something ? Hey , you bitch . ( SCREAMS ) I just wanted to say to them , like , " Guys , I 'm a writer who moved here from New York City . " Like , I 'm way cooler than your regular teacher . " - This day could 've been super fun . - Kids are always rough on subs . This is different from what we were like growing up . They 're , like , not even kids . ( YELLS ) The fuck ? He can 't be that funny . ( LAUGHING ) So single . Ooh-la-la . ( BOTH CHUCKLING ) Yeah , I 'm such a catch . You 'll be beating off the women in Fort Chicken . Oh , yeah . Fort Chicken girls . Yeah , the hottest . ( GROWLING ) ( WOMAN ) What is happening here , kids ? Goddamnit . What is wrong with me ? Oh , no , you didn 't . ( MAN OVER RADIO ) Vice Principal Simms ? Yeah , you 're go for Simms . I 'm under some medication for a medical condition So I may not be seeing things correctly . But I 'm pretty sure I might be seeing some of your students possibly eating Mr. Peterson . Again , it could be the medication . OK . All right . Shaw 's over . Hey , I may be acting principal , but you all are acting crazy . Hey , don 't ... Don 't ... ( ALL LAUGHING ) I have bursitis . I have bursitis in my elbow . Who ... ? Who is your homeroom ?

Carnage . - Somebody call the police . - Wait . Oh , hey , my button . ( ALARM BEEPING AND BOTH SCREAM ) Come on , Johnson . What the fuck is happening ? What the fuck is happening ? Wait , there 's Wade . Wade . ( CHILDREN CACKLING AND GROWLING ) Oh , God . All right , listen up . I 'd back off if I was you . I was an all-state football champion , y 'all are a bunch of kids . Look , we 've all wanted to do that to Vice Principal Simms , OK ? I know I have . But a ... A line has been crossed . You can 't eat the teachers , man . Calm down right now . ( YELLING AND GRUNTING ) Come on , Johnson . Run , Johnson . They attacked the vice principal . ( MAN OVER PHONE ) Ma ' am , you need to calm down . Then they started chas ... Hello ? Hello ? ( BOY GROWLING AND GRUNTING ) ( TRACY ) The phones are dead . ( THUDS AND ALL SCREAM ) Those kids are fast . I was twice voted running back of the year , Cary County , and should 've went a third year , but it was political ... - What the fuck are you trying to say ? - Do not go out there . Those kids ... ( ALL SCREAMING ) - Oh , God . - Oh , no , no , no . It 's Angela . Hi , Angela . It 's me , Mr. Lacey . Oh , there 's Dave . Dave 's coming . ( SIREN CHIRPING ) See , everything 's gonna be fine . Shit , man . Five-0 . Fuck it . I ain 't going down . All right , kids . Settle down . You little guys need to tell me what 's going on . ( CHILDREN GROWLING ) You all eat cherry pie for lunch or something ? What 's going on ? I 'm here to help . Think of me just like Batman . I 'm a helper . ( ALL SCREAMING ) What the fuck ? !

( GRUNTING AND SCREAMING ) - He 's gonna bite your face . - I can see that . He 'll tear your goddamn face off . You 'll look like that chimp woman . You 're achieving nothing . - Help me ! - Let me burn his face ! Who is that lady ? - Anybody have a key ? - Probably not . - Let 's go . - Wait , wait , wait . - We can 't just leave her there . - ( WADE ) Come on . Move . Move . Come on . Come on , we gotta get out of here . Follow me . I do CrossFit . - No , don 't do it . - ( MAN ) You sons of bitches . ( ALL GASPING AND SCREAMING ) Fuck . - Go , go , go . - ( LUCY ) Wade , what ... ? In here . - Kill him ! I hate it ! Kill him ! - No . Wait . He 's not like the others . And I 'm not saying that because you 're the only black student . - Differences make life beautiful . - What 's going on ? - Kill him ! - No , wait . Tracy 's right . Calvin , are you OK ? You don 't have a thirst for blood or anything ? Why would I ? I 'm studying for my test . - Great . How 's it going ? - OK , fuck the test . - We gotta seek out higher ground . - OK . Come on , Calvin . You come with us . ( ALL SCREAMING AND GROWLING ) We 're clear . In here , come on . - Come on . - Close the door . Close the door . - Close the door . - Get it . - Hey , hey . Is everyone OK ? - I think so . Yes . - Are you OK ? - Can we please take a moment ... ? Get in here . Come on . Come on . She has blisters . We 're safe . The door is locked . They can 't get through these windows . The phone 's out in here too . Can somebody explain to me what is going on ? What is going on ? ! I blame rap music . I hated my teachers in school . But I never tried to kill them . - They got cooties . - What ? That 's what they 're always saying that girl Shelly has . Cooties . She 's dirty . - Calvin , that 's not very nice . - No , he 's right . In a ... In a way . If you 'll follow me , you 'll see ... - You 're not hurt , are you ? - ( WADE ) No , I 'm good . ... she has the raised blisters of a vi ... A virus . I 'm OK . We 're safe here , right ? Everybody feels OK ? And we 're all safe . It 's pretty interesting actually . I knew we 'd work it all out , heh . I would love to get inside your head . Oh . She 's gone to commit murder somewhere else . All right , ladies , here 's the plan . We get down on that ledge , jump to the ground , hightail it like linebackers to our cars , boom . I thought you tried to outrun them . - You said they were too fast for you . - Yeah , but that was before I had a weapon . A violin ? Not just a violin . It 's an instrument of death . I propose we create a symphony of death . Everyone grab an instrument . Here . You take this . - Oh , yeah , that 'll be real effective . - I 'm offering leadership . What are you offering , besides throwing hot pots of coffee at people , or a stupid book no one wants to read about a guy who wants to fuck a boat ? It 's not about a guy who wants to fuck a boat . - It 's about obsession and possession ... - He wants to fuck the boat . - Listen ... - Listen , Stevie King ... There 's an invention called a cell phone that your school confiscated . We need to get to the office , grab our phones and call someone who can help quarantine these kids . We 're in a lockdown in case you haven 't noticed . We have been breached . There are little cootie kids out in the hallway who will fucking rip your face off with their little teeth . - ( CLINT ) Well , shit ... - Their big teeth haven 't come in yet . ( PHONES RINGING ) ( GRUNTING ) You carry on with your symphony of death . I 'll sneak around the school where there aren 't kids . Oh , you sneak around , huh ? Sneak around like a little hobbit . I 'm taking the fight to them like a fucking orc . That 's the difference between you and me . I don 't wanna scurry . I don 't scurry like a common squirrel . Both of you be quiet ! The only way we 're gonna get anywhere is if we turn our frowns upside down and try to get along . OK ? You know how I beat the terrorists after 9 / 11 ? - With a positive attitude . - It 's true . She did . I don 't think going back for our cell phones is necessarily a great idea . Even though it 's wonderful that you 're trying . We welcome all suggestions . - Wait , I just thought of something . - What is it ? Um , it 's just an idea for Keel Them All . The hero 's trapped on the boat and my mum doesn 't understand why he wouldn 't just call for help . I got it . He left his phone on the dock . What are you talking about ? Oh , sorry . My book . Are you fucking kidding me ? - Unbelievable . - Your book is called Keel Them All ? OK , can we convene the book club a little later on , please ? Wade , I think maybe your idea is maybe an unwise idea also . - Seriously , Lucy ? - I 'm sorry . So , what do you propose ? That we wait here until 3.00 . Um , OK , what happens at 3.00 ? At 3.00 the parents will come to pick up their kids . We get on the roof and signal them for help . - I like that idea . It 's a good one . - Better than your fucking idea . - Anything 's better than your idea . - Oh . Clint , are you OK ? That sounds ... Yeah , no . I 'm fine . I 'm fine . What happened to your arm ? - Oh , it 's nothing ... - Ah . - ( WADE ) Oh , shit . - What ? It 's just a scratch . - He 's infected . - It 's nothing . I 'm fine . ( WADE ) You got cooties , motherfucker . Time for a quarantine . - No . I 'm feeling fine . - ( WADE ) You 're coming with me . - Stop resisting . Don 't resist . - I feel fine . - Quarantine . - ( LUCY ) Wade . Wade . ( CLINT ) Let me out , asshole . ( WADE ) Nobody else go in there . ( VOMITS ) I 'm going in . Doug , don 't ... I don 't care - . ( CHILDREN SCREAMING AND GROWLING ) ( CRIES ) ( SONG PLAYING OVER RADIO ) ( MAN OVER RAND ) We have some breaking news developing in the suburb of Fort Chicken this morning ... - ( LUCY ) What if he ... ? - Excuse me . Listen up , please . Could everybody please listen up ? Guys , don 't make me ask again . Quiet . Quiet , please . - Please , be quiet . - None of us are talking . ( DOUG ) Rebekka . Quiet , please . Thank you . It is my opinion - that Clint has been infected with ... - I knew it . - ... whatever those kids have out there . - Oh , my God . ( DOUG ) It doesn 't seem to be affecting him the same way . He 's only exhibiting mild stomach-flu symptoms . Nausea , cramps , a little diarrhoea , vomiting , mild anal leakage . But it is my hypothesis that we are safe from him for now . He will not attempt to murder us or tear us limb from limb . - He just has the flu . - Hold on a second . How do you ... ? How do you know all this ? ( DOUG ) Well , Rebekka , I just examined his fluids with two of histories oldest scientific instruments . My hands . Doug . - Heh , don 't worry . I 'm wearing gloves . - ( TRACY ) Oh , no , you 're not . - ( DOUG ) No . - No , you 're not . - ( WADE ) Damn it , Doug . - ( TRACY ) Keep it together . I see . OK , OK , it doesn 't matter . Listen , the sub stays locked in the closet . He gets a clean bill of health at 3.00 , then we 'll talk . ( INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE ) ( WATCH BLEEPS ) Go time . - Keep your distance , Grisham . - ( CLINT ) There 's vomit there . - Sorry . Watch your step . - ( TRACY ) Are you all right ? - ( LUCY ) How you feeling ? Come on . - Um , better . - OK . That 's yours . - Oh , thank you . ( LUCY ) Wait . Oh , I know that car . That 's the PTA president , Racer Dopkins ' mum . She gets here early to open the gates . - Hey , hey , over here ! - Hey ! - Hey ! - Hey ! Hey ! - Call for help ! - Use the phone ! This could fall apart . I 'm just thinking about the children . - Hey ! - ( WADE ) 911 ! Those little bastards are gonna kill her . - She 's gonna be fine . - Wait , there he is . - ( TRACY ) No , no . - Don 't open the door . - She doesn 't even see him . - Don 't let him in ! Don 't let him in ! Who 's Mummy 's angel ? Who 's Mummy 's angel ? Yes , you are . Yes , you are . - Get out of the car ! - No ! - You tell Simms that $ 300 won 't cut it . - Mrs. Dobkins ! Mrs. Dobkins , don 't do it ! God , Steve . Don 't even give me that . I know what 's going on in the school 24 / 7 . Come on , Racer . Let 's go . ( CAR DOOR OPEN THEN CLOSES ) You wanna go to soccer practise or not , honey puckle ? ( BABY SCREAMING ) I 'm not gonna be the one holding the book at the book ride again this year . No . You ... Racer , what the hell are you doing to your brother back there now ? ( SCREAMS ) - They go right for the face . - ( LUCY ) I told you . We have to warn the others . They 'll be here any second . They 'll massacre the other parents . ( SCREAMS ) - Oh , my God . - Oh , my God . - Oh , my God ! - Help me . - She 's not one of them . - How do you know ? Look at her face . It 's not covered in pox . - Help her . - Oh , God . They 're coming . They 're coming . They 're coming . They 're getting up on the roof . They 're in the tree . Move ! - Come on ! - Go , go , go ! - ( WADE ) Where do we go ? - ( MAN ) Go , go , go . To the auditorium . ( WADE ) Don 't give up . Let 's go . Move , move , move .

Tammy , why don 't you and Calvin come on over here with me ? - That guy always cheated off me . - Calvin . I 'll make sure all the doors are secure . ( REBEKKA ) Why ... ? Why is his blood black ? I don 't know . That 's what I wanna find out . I think I 'm gonna dissect him . Hey , look at us . We 're fine . We 're fine . You know , we 're still us , because ... You know why ? Because none of us got bitten or scratched . I did . Oh . It 's fine . We 'll go to the washroom and wash it out with soap so it won 't get infected , OK ? What do you say ? Oh , God . I can 't believe you 're doing this . I can 't believe boys pee in those . I mean , that 's disgusting . That 's disgusting ? It 's not disgusting to have boys staring at each other 's penises ? What 's wrong with that ? OK , we got bigger things to worry about . Well , this is interesting . - Oh , my God . - Oh , God . - ( REBEKKA ) Oh , God . - I 'm gonna extract the brain . - Oh , that 's just rude . - ( REBEKKA ) Damn it . ( MAN OVER RADIO ) The preliminary reports have been confirmed . Children are for some reason violently attacking their parents in front of Fort Chicken Elementary . We have reports of victims around the city . Authorities have no idea what is going on . Stay inside , stay in your cars , do not go out ... ( MAN SCREAMING ) ( VOICE ) Dude , this is totally tripping me out . Are you on shrooms too ? Hey . - Can I get you anything ? - I 'd really rather be left alone , Lucy . Wade , can we please talk ? I don 't wanna talk . I know you don 't , but I do . Why don 't you talk to your boyfriend about it ? Clint and I went to school together . I haven 't seen him in 15 years . I walked in this morning , the guy was fucking hitting on you and you were eating it up . - Are you kidding me ? - No , I 'm not . You can 't even deny it . Deny it . Clint and I were just talking . And I 'm sorry if I hurt your feelings . I didn 't mean to . - Oh . - Look , I 'm sorry . I know neither of us thought this was how the day was gonna go - when we woke up this morning . - No , we didn 't . I thought today was gonna go way different than this . You have no idea . I bought you a ring yesterday , Lucy . Then I walk in and I see you laughing and smiling at that little asshole . And you know what I thought ? I thought , " Wow , she looks so pretty when she smiles . " How come she never smiles at me like that ? " I 'll talk to you later , Lucy . And go fuck yourself . ( DOOR CLOSES ) Prognosis is not good . As you can see , most of the grey and white matter has been ... Rebekka , quiet please . Most of the grey and white matter has been severely infected . It 's showing the beginning stages of necrosis and decomposition . All these black areas are basically dead . I mean , they can run , jump , eat , but they 're not human anymore . - Not really . - Once again , how do you know all this ? I learned all about the brain when I had a 6 " spike lodged in my skull as a child . Which is the reason why , you may have noticed , sometimes I use the wrong rowboat . - Word . - Word . Now , bacteria can 't cross the blood brain barrier . So I 'm thinking this is more likely a virus . What kind of virus would do that ? A pretty nasty one . Calvin said Shelly Lanker was the first to bite . - Right ? - Yeah . What about Clint and Tamra ? All it did was make them sick . I have a theory about this . Hold on a moment . - Tamra ? - ( TAMRA ) Yeah ? - Have you achieved menses ? - ( TAMRA ) What ? ( LUCY ) No , he 's asking you if you 've had your period yet . - ( TAMRA ) Um , I really don 't wanna say . - You wear a bra , right ? - ( TAMRA ) Yeah . - Thank you . I gave you an A in sex ed , Tamra . Little disappointed you don 't know what menses are . Why is sex ed always taught - by the creepiest teacher ? - Clint , quiet please . It seems the virus is susceptible to androgens . The pre-pubescent body has testosterone and oestrogen , but at puberty the body 's glands create a feedback cycle - that increases gonadotropins ... - What are you trying to say ? Talk like a person . Please ? The virus is only dangerous if you haven 't gone through puberty . ( ALL SCREAM ) - What 's going on ? How 'd they do that ? - ( WADE ) Everyone stay calm . Calvin . Oh , shit . Calvin . - ( LUCY ) Calvin . - ( CLINT ) Over here , guys . ( LUCY ) Calvin ? Wake up . Wake up . - Calvin . - Quit slapping me . ( LUCY ) He 's diabetic . He needs to eat . We need to get him a candy bar or a soda . Wade , do you have any snack bars or something ? - I got creatine powder . - He needs something with sugar . This body is a no-carb zone . ( THUDDING ) What was that ? Probably one of the demented children that 's been trying to murder us all day . It 's coming from over there . - They 're in the boiler room . - They can 't be . I 've checked all these doors . They 're locked . ( CRASHING ) ( REBEKKA ) Oh , my God . They have keys ? You said they couldn 't do stuff like that . They 're gonna get in . We 're all going to die . This can 't be the end . I 'm not published . Wade , I thought about it and I can 't marry you . ( ALL SCREAMING ) - Jesus , it 's the fucking janitor . - Hitachi ? - ( REBEKKA ) What are you doing here ? - The lights are out . ( THUDS ) - We gotta move . - Go . ( WADE ) Come on ! ( ALL SCREAMING AND GROWLING ) Move it , move it . Watch your step . What the hell ? - You live down here ? - ( HITACHI ) Yes . - Where are we ? - Oh , my God . We have a kid who needs help . He 's diabetic . Do you have any food ? ( SPEAKS IN JAPANESE ) Seaweed . I 'm afraid that won 't work . No . The microwave . ( MAN OVER RADIO ) This is the emergency broadcast system for the township of Fort Chicken , Illinois . Effective immediately , the mayor of Fort Chicken has announced mandatory evacuations of neighbourhoods east of Winslow Avenue . Authorities are reporting the spread of a highly contagious virus . Reports say ... ( STATIC ) We 're alone . We 're all gonna die , aren 't we ? No . No , we 're not . There 's a snack machine in the teacher 's lounge , right ? - Yeah . - How many people can fit in your truck ? Told you , it 's a dual real wheel . Dual real ... It 's a dual real whe ... - Probably eight . - Where are the keys ? - With my jacket . - ( CLINT ) Which is where ? Back in the teachers ' lounge which is impossible to get to . Where does that lead ? Conditioning of air . So this duct takes us to the teacher 's lounge ? We take the duct to the lounge . We get something from the vending machine and grab Wade 's keys . We get back here , fix Calvin up and take the duct to the parking lot . If we 're near the office we should grab our phones too . But who 's going up into that thing ? Who 's teensy , weensy enough to fit ... ? Me ? No , no , no . No , I ... No , I definitely don 't do brave stuff . I 've never even been camping . I have a blog . I get excited about Apple products . That 's what I 'm comfortable with . ( WADE ) Here we go . By letting you guard this , I 'm trusting you with my entire life . Circle , circle , dot , dot , now you have a cootie shot . - It 'll protect you . - Thanks , Tamra . ( PANTING ) ( DOUG OVER RADIO ) Remember , Clint . If you fail , we 're all gonna die . ( CLINT OVER RADIO ) I appreciate the update . - You 're doing great . Just trust yourself . - Yeah , and your cock is girthy too . - ( CLINT ) Fuck off , Wade . - You fuck off . Both of you out it out . You know who you sound like ? You sound like your students . ( CLINT ) I don 't have students . I 'm not a teacher . I 'm a writer . Yeah , self-published , writer . I 'm self-published too . Doug , you wanna buy my book ? ( DOUG ) There are no words on this . - You know what ? I 'm going to ... - Lucy , what are you doing ? - No . No , you are not ... - You can 't do anything to stop me ! If I wanna go in the fucking air-conditioning duct , I 'll go . I 'm just gonna die anyway just like the rest of you assholes . So maybe I 'm gonna try and do something brave . A final pointless gesture of kindness in this cruel shitty world that likes taking gestures of kindness and shitting and peeing on them . You know what else ? Since you 're all gonna be dead soon anyway , I should tell you I hate every single one of you . ( CLINT SCREAMS ) It 's me . It 's me ! I 'm coming with you whether you like it or not , so shut up . OK . This makes me so nervous . He paces like this late at night when he 's on the phone too . It 's just ridiculous . How do you know that ? You 'd better not let anything happen to her . That 's funny . I was thinking of letting really bad things happen to her . I will squeeze up in there and slap your dick off . - Thanks for coming to help me . - No problem . ( THUDS ) ( BOTH PANTING ) I think this is it . ( LUCY SCREAMS ) ( CLATTERING ) Careful . - Oh . Um , do you have a dollar ? - Yeah . There 's Wade 's keys . I 'm gonna go check and see if there 's a phone . - No , wait for me . - No , we don 't have time . You get the candy bar . I 'm gonna get a phone . ( CLINT ) OK , be careful . Come on . Come on . Shit . ( GROWLING ) ( CHILDREN SCREAMING ) - ( LUCY ) Clint , get in ! Get in ! - I 'm working on it . Come on . Hurry up ! ( CLINT AND LUCY GRUNTING ) We 're not gonna make it . Go left . Guys , head 's up . They did it . Hey , look what we got for you . ( LUCY ) Put it back , put it back . ( CLINT ) The desk ! The desk ! I don 't know how much longer I can hold this . ( SCREAMS ) Oh , my God . Oh , my God . - Miss Stanford . - Jesus . ( BOTH GASPING AND PANTING ) After the fifth half-eaten corpse you see , it 's still horrifying , but somehow slightly less horrifying . Shit . Look out . They 're in the vents . They 're heading your way . - I 'll get the locks . - OK . - More stuff . Come on . - Here . - ( REBEKKA ) Here . - Let 's go . Come on . - Keep it coming . - ( REBEKKA ) Here . Straps . Come on . ( WADE ) Got it . Why do they pound ? What does the pounding accomplish ? ( CLINT OVER RADIO ) Are you guys OK ? Yeah , we 're all good . Thanks for the heads-up . We 're not all good . We are trapped in here . Oh , God , those kids are gonna come in here . - They 're gonna rip us to shreds . - We get it . You 've got to calm down right now . - I know . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . - Calm . I 'm fine . ( SIGHS ) - I 'm calm . - OK . Thank you . Calm down . I 'm calm ! I already said I was calm ! This is like the worst Monday ever . ( SOBBING ) This probably isn 't the greatest timing , but I have a confession to make . When I saw you this morning , I was only pretending to be surprised . I knew you taught here . Really ? Yeah , I 've been pretty depressed lately and I just wanted to see you . It 's stupid . We haven 't had a conversation in like 15 years . I guess I kind of missed you somehow . - Sorry , that 's so creepy . - No , it 's not creepy . I 'm just surprised . I heard you were in New York following your dream being a writer . I have another confession to make . Remember when I said I wasn 't a teacher ? That was a lie too . That 's what I was doing in New York . ( BOTH CHUCKLE ) Really ? Yeah . Yeah , I 've been teaching first grade for two years . I mean , I thought I would have free time to write , um , on my free time , but as it turns out there is no free time . Teaching is the hardest job in the world . And I would look out at the kids in my class and I found myself getting jealous of them . They have the whole world ahead of them . Their whole lives ahead of them . They have all these opportunities that have already passed me by . What ? Nothing . I was gonna tell you , you were wrong , but you sort of have a point . Oh , that 's super comforting . Thanks . ( BOTH CHUCKLING ) ( BOTH MOANING ) Oh . - I probably shouldn 't have done that . - I know . I know . I can 't just barge into your life like that . Even if I do kind of hate your boyfriend . ( BOTH CHUCKLING ) Just need a bottle of wine . Right ? One of those backpacks must have some beer in it . Definitely Ritalin . Probably Adderall too . Wait . ( POUNDING ) There 's still so much I haven 't done . Like ... Like I 've also wanted to fire an Uzi . I don 't know . I wanted a bunny . I always wanted a bunny growing up and never got one . You know what I want ? I wanna know why my brother-in-law makes ten times what I do . You know what he does for a living ? He makes giant foam fingers for football games . You tell people you 're a teacher and they look at you like you must 've wanted to do something else . It 's like , " Fuck you , man . I 'm raising your kids . " I love my job . - And teachers deserve respect . - Yeah . I 'm sorry that it took me until today to realise this , but I really actually like you guys . ( CHUCKLES ) I always wanted to have sex with a prostitute who was non-white . Is anybody there ? Wade ? - ( WADE OVER RADIO ) Hey . You OK ? - Yeah . ( WADE ) Hey . Listen , Lucy , about today ... Wade , we can talk about this another time . - Let 's not talk about this now . - No , I wanna talk about it . Lucy , I love you and I 'm so sorry that I was an asshole today . Clint 's not listening , is he ? - No , it 's just me . - Good . Because ... Look , I know you 're not crazy about your hometown . And this is not what you pictured growing up that you 'd be dating some PE teacher . I guess I just got jealous that some fancy-pants New York writer - was gonna swoop in ... - No , wait . I know you 've always wanted to live there . - I don 't know that that 's something ... - Wade , it 's Clint . - Damn it , put Lucy back on . - I 'm not a fancy writer from New York . I 'm a bad writer from Fort Chicken . I live with my mum . I sleep in a bed I used to pee in . You 're a handsome guy who Lucy likes , and if you guys are meant to be together I 'm all for it . I 'm sorry I got in the way . You really think I 'm a handsome guy ? Listen . Thanks , Clint . Just ... Can you put Lucy back on , please ? ( LUCY OVER RADIO ) Wade , I love you , but I ... - ( CLINT ) Wade , it 's me again . - Goddamnit ! I have an idea . Listen up . ( CHILDREN GROWLING ) Oh , dear lord . ( LUCY ) Is the coast clear ? If by clear you mean full of terrifying imagery that will take me years of therapy to unsee . Hey . Hey , sweetie . OK , go for it . Look , drugs . You hungry for drugs ? Want some Ritalin ? Some Adderall ? Do you remember how in that movie Commando , and every other eighties action film there was that suiting-up montage ? - Well , this is that scene . - Yeah . Now , they 've got us outnumbered , outgunned and out numbered , but there 's one thing we have that they don 't . The drive to win . They seem very driven to me . ( WADE ) We need to turn this room inside out . Look under every shelf , inside every box , gather anything you or someone else could use . We 've got to collect everything . We 've gotta have bats and tools and ropes and pointy things . Anything that has a spike on it , anything that 's serrated . We 're not playing defence anymore . Darn fourth graders . You can forget about them . They 're gone . Forget who you think you 're fighting . We 're going to war . I used to be a champion . I 'm a little fatter now , I 'm a little balder too , but I 've still got that spirit . And they are not taking that away from me . Ever . I 've played dodgeball a million times with these little shits . Go for the face . It 's their weak spot . ( CLINT ) Huh . I guess they really can overdose on that stuff . ( CLINT OVER RADIO ) OK , looks like the Adderall did the job . They should be knocked out for a while . When we say go , rendezvous in the main hall , head straight for the back door , then haul ass to Wade 's truck . Ready ? We are good to go . We can do this . Between us we 've got 18 regional-championship trophies , three MVPs , and one state-championship ring . ( LUCY OVER RADIO ) Wade , those are all your awards . Exactly , and I 'm a part of this team . That makes us all champions . Now , are we ready ? - Ready . - Ready . - I 'm gay . - I fucking knew it . Hitachi , you ready ? Yes , Hitachi ready to die . My father told me story once . Story of frog and caterpillar . Story goes , it was winter and frog is sitting on snow-covered branch . The frog saw the caterpillar and asked ... OK , this story is taking way too long . Let 's play some dodgeball . ( ALL YELLING ) Hey , guys . ( CHILDREN GROWLING ) OK , I got this . Come on . ( CHILDREN SCREAMING AND GROWLING ) ( WADE ) Fuck , yeah . Let 's go . Go , go . Move it . - Let 's go . - ( TRACY ) OK . Go , go , go . ( WADE ) Damn it , I 'm out of balls . Oh , shit . ( SCREAMING AND GROWLING ) ( GRUNTING ) Fuck . Rock ' n ' roll ! ( ALL GRUNTING ) Get back . - Lucy ? Where 's Lucy ? - I don 't know . Come on . Come on . You motherfuckers ! - Thanks . - Take me to Subway some time . - Lucy . - OK . OK . Get behind me . Get back . Get back . Get back . ( WADE ) Give me the keys . - Get those kids to the truck . - Go , go , go . Get off him ! ( LUCY ) Come on , let 's go . ( REBEKKA ) He 's behind us . Get in . Get in . Hey , Danielle Steel . Take care of her . No ! - No , no , no , Lucy . No . - No . Wade . ( YELLING AND GRUNTING ) - No , no , no . Hang on , Lucy . Lucy , no . - Wade ! No ! No ! No ! ( WADE SCREAMS ) No , we gotta go . We gotta go . Go . - Get in . - Oh , my God . Oh , God . ( LUCY ) Wade ? ( WADE SCREAMS ) No ! Lucy , I 'm sorry . What about these kids ' parents ? What about our parents ? Shit . - ( LUCY ) What ? - What ? We 're almost empty . ( ALL SCREAMING ) Everybody hold on ! ( ALL GASPING ) ( DOUG ) Must have been in the back the whole time . - ( LUCY ) Are you OK ? - ( REBEKKA ) Yes . Oh , my God . What is he doing ? Ram him ! Eat a cock . Well , that ought to do it . ( CLINT ) Guys , up ahead . It 's Danville . ( TRACY ) At least it 's not Fort Chicken . ( LUCY ) Oh , no . ( CLINT ) Jesus . ( LUCY ) They got out . ( REBEKKA ) Well , I 'd feel worse if all these dead people weren 't from fucking Danville . Well , now we 're really out of gas . Everybody stay close . - Wait . Where 's Doug ? - There he is . - Doug , come on . - ( DOUG ) No , you come here . They 're everywhere . That 's Indiana . That 's Ohio . It 's an epidemic . Actually the correct term is pandemic . A pandemic covers a much wider geographical ... That 's the Fort Chicken factory . Is there anything from that factory served in the school cafeteria ? ( IN UNISON ) Chicken nuggets . ( DOUG ) Of course . A food-borne virus . If I could get homing endonucleases , each one targeting a different specific ... You 're doing it again . You 're doing it again . ( DOUG ) Rebekka , quiet please . ( REBEKKA ) OK , see , that time I was actually talking . ( DOUG ) If we could isolate the virus and kill it while preserving the capsid ... - ( REBEKKA ) Please dumb it down . - If I could find one of the nuggets , maybe I could make a vaccine for the virus . ( ALL GASPING AND SCREAMING ) ( SCREAMING AND GROWLING ) ( CLINT ) Everybody look for an open door . - Guys , hurry up . Get in here . - Go , go , go . ( CLINT ) Everyone OK ? ( LUCY ) OK , we 're here . We made it . ( REBEKKA ) Oh , I fucking hate Danville so much . ( CLINT ) Everyone stick together . ( REBEKKA ) I can 't ... I can 't see anything . ( TRACY ) Someone find a li ... ( ALL SCREAM AND DOUG CHUCKLES ) - It 's me . - Jesus . These things are great . Let 's go this way . ( LUCY ) Oh , my God . Those are the nuggets . ( DOUG ) You 'll come in handy , little one . Nugget out of here . Nugget out ... Nugget out of here . OK . Come on . Come on . Where are we ? ( GIRL LAUGHING ) ( CHILDREN SCREAMING AND GROWLING ) - I hate to say it , guys . - ( DOUG ) Oh , shit . Oh , shit . ( LAUGHING ) ( ALL GASPING ) ( ENGINE REVVING ) Somebody order a bad-ass ? Wade ! Now , Hitachi . Now the time for the frog to fuck the caterpillar ? Whatever , Hitachi . - ( CLINT ) They 're coming . - Let 's go ! Get in the van ! Let 's go . Move , move , move ! I thought you were dead . It was just half time , baby . Go to the van ! Run ! Run ! Run ! ( SCREAMING AND GRUNTING ) Hurry ! Let 's go . We can make it . ( CLINT ) Help me wedge this in here . Clint , go . Get out of here . - Kids , kids , go , go , go . - Oh , my God . Is this one of those really intense drug interventions ? I 'm giving you kids an F for fuck you ! Go , go , go ! What are you doing ? Water won 't hold them off . It ain 't water . Nap time , motherfuckers . Let 's roll . - ( LUCY ) Where are we going ? - ( CLINT ) Place kids don 't wanna go . Wade , how did you find us ? ( WADE ) I always know where to find my dual re ... Real ... My dual re ... Dual real ... My dual real whe ... Ripped by GoldenBeard ( HITACHI ) And the frog fucked the caterpillar . Ha .

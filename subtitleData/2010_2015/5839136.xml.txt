 COULSON : Previously on Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I. E.L. D ... SKYE : And an 084 is ? An object of unknown origin . Ripped By mstoll COULSON : Skye 's the 084 ? And who do you work for , Raina ? The Clairvoyant ? The Clairvoyant gives us guidance . COULSON : He has you building super-soldiers . SKYE : Mike 's a good guy . Mike ! ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) No . COULSON : Ian Quinn . You 've got to be kidding . This is Quinn 's MO . He finds young talent , and he takes advantage . COULSON : We 're on to you . QUINN : Thank you , Agent Coulson . I have a message for you . The Clairvoyant told me to say , " Hello . " - Lan Quinn . - You found him ? No . But we think we know how we can . Skye tracked down an invoice from one of his shell companies . He made a big purchase recently . $ 10 million big . - Any idea what it is ? - SKYE : No clue . But it was designed and built by Cybertek , Inc . A small firm that deals in advanced technology and research . Which is where this gets interesting . They 've hired a private security outfit to transport the purchase . Former military . Ex-mercs . A lot of muscle to move one package . And they know S.H.I. E.L. D 's got eyes on Quinn . Which is why they 're transporting it old-school . COULSON : On a train through the Italian countryside . From Verona to Zagreb . Very rural , very isolated . And you think Quinn 's on that train ? No , but I believe they 're delivering the item to Quinn himself . We got our Intel from Italian authorities who 've been monitoring the situation . And they don 't mind us taking over the op ? I asked very nicely . You 're not asking me at all , Agent Coulson . You 're telling me and my team to step aside . To hand over our investigation to S.H.I. E.L.D. Try to think of it less as a hand over and more as a hand off . You 've done your part . Now we 'll do ours . If everything goes as planned , Cybertek 's security team won 't even know we were on the train . So we 're going in undercover . ( SIGHS ) I hate undercover . COULSON : May and Ward , you 're front and center . Once we locate the package , you 'll tag it with a tracker . Skye and Fitz , you 'll be running communications . After the package is tagged , we 'll follow it to Quinn . Once we capture Quinn , we 'll be one step closer to The Clairvoyant . And what about the two of us , sir ? Here , let me get that . Oh , thanks , Dad . ( WHISPERING ) Who looks far too young to have a daughter my age . ( SPEAKING ITALIAN ) That looks cozy . Once I 've located the package , I 'll let you know where to place the tracker . Seem like things are getting personal ? - I 'm talking about our operations . - Ah . Look , I know Coulson was put through hell , but ... He hasn 't been the same since . I don 't know what he said to Skye , but she 's different . How so ? Driven . Focused . She was holed up for days trying to track down Quinn . It feels like Coulson 's got her on a warpath . - It seems personal . - It is personal . The Clairvoyant had him tortured . Quinn 's the only person we know who 's connected to all this . We both know personal urges can adversely affect tactical decisions . Hmm , that 's why I don 't have any . You should do the same . Really ? You think Coulson 'll take that excuse if he finds out about us ? Took it okay when I told him . Wait . You told him ? Yep . You nervous ? Just ready for this all to be over . Ready to get Quinn . Me , too . So are we British or American ? - Does that matter ? - Well , we 're traveling together . We should at least be from the same country . How 's your Scottish accent ? ( MANGLING SCOTTISH ACCENT ) I don 't know . You tell me how great it is , laddie . ( IMITATING AMERICAN ACCENT ) American then . That 's a better idea . Oh ! That was really good . I used to watch a lot of American TV growing up . Some of it 's quite good . Lots of nice teeth . Oh , here we go . Follow my lead . Excuse me . Do you speak English ? Of course . How may I be of service ? Can you recommend a restaurant in downtown Zagreb ? Someplace affordable . With big portions . You are looking for something romantic ? Yes , please . Mmm-hmm ! ( CHUCKLES ) We are celebrating our six-month anniversary with a whirlwind trip all over Europe . Well technically , we met six months ago , but he didn 't ask me out till last month . So our official one-month anniversary - isn 't until next Saturday . - Sunday . Saturday . I think he found me intimidating . Young love , so confusing . Is it ? You got a little flustered back there . What , when you kissed me on the cheek like my grandmother ? Good going . Really selling our relationship there . I have a device that could 've done those things . - Broken the lock and all that . - What ? Why wouldn 't you tell me that ? I 'm always the gadget guy . Maybe sometimes I wanna do things with my bare hands . You make the gadgets with your hands . Just allow me these rare moments of self-pity , okay ? You 're the least supportive pretend girlfriend I 've ever had . ( CHUCKLING ) Comms are live . Coulson ? Simmons ? You in position ? Yes . Just waiting on May 's signal . So , remember . Our target is Carlo ... Mancini . The head of security . I know . I memorized his face . I memorized everything . What are you doing ? Oh , I 'm getting into character . My undercover persona harbors residual resentment to her absent American father . Blames him for not being there when her mum died . So I apologize in advance if I come off a little cold . You think all that backstory 's necessary ? Past events , like that unfortunate incident at The Hub , have shown me that I 'm not good at improvisation . However , I excel at preparation . FITZ : He 's headed your way . You 're on . All Mum ever wanted was your love . To be with you . On our two-story Victorian home in the Cotswolds . But could you even give her a moment ? What with your banking job requiring you to travel to the States from Tuesday to Saturday every other week ? No ! I 'm terribly sorry about your loss , dear . As for you . Now is your chance to do better . Why don 't you see that you take it ! Thank you , sir . Let 's go . He 's right . You never had any time for her . But you made time for your work . And your prostitutes ! ( WOMAN GASPS ) ( BOTH GASPING ) COULSON : Oh , God ! Oh , no ! Mum ! ( SPEAKING ITALIAN ) COULSON : Terribly sorry . Prostitutes ? Plural ? May , coming your way . Copy that . Following the target to the package . SKYE : Great . We see what you see . FITZ : All right , May , Cybertek cases are usually lined with tungsten polymer to prevent scanning . It should appear black on your infrared . Bingo . Eyes on the package , fourth seat from the back . ( BRAKES HISSING ) ( P.A. PLAYS TONE ) ( RECORDED ANNOUNCEMENT IN ITALIAN ) As we round the bend , the passengers on the north side of the train can take in the views of the famous Tre Cime di Lavaredo . Isn 't it a wonder ? Look at that . I haven 't seen anything so beautiful since our family 's scuba diving trip to the island of Koh Tao in southeastern Thailand . Okay , Simmons , I appreciate all your preparation , but ... Don 't you want to know which marine life we encountered ? Ward , are you in position ? ( INTERFERENCE ON COMMS ) My comms are down . Are yours working ? Fitz ? Skye ? Something 's wrong . Sit tight . I 'm gonna go make sure we don 't lose that package . - Ward ! - We 've been made ! ( SHOUTING IN ITALIAN ) - Grenade ! Coulson , we gotta jump ! - ( DEVICE CHARGING UP ) ( GRUNTING ) ( BRAKES HISSING ) ( P.A. PLAYS TONE ) ( RECORDED ANNOUNCEMENT IN ITALIAN ) As we round the bend , the passengers on the north side of the train can take in the views of the famous Tre Cime di Lavaredo . Isn 't it a wonder ? May . Got the tracker . Headed to the dining car now to tag the package . ( INTERFERENCE ON COMMS ) May ? May ? ( SPEAKING ITALIAN ) ( GRUNTS ) ( BOTH GRUNTING ) Cybertek knew we were here . Anyone copy ? ( INTERFERENCE ON COMMS ) Damn it . We 've been made . Comms are down . Where 's Coulson ? He went to the dining car to find the package . You 've been hurt . Let me take a look . Not now . Go to the luggage car . Lock yourself in with Fitz and Skye . Don 't come out until I get you . I 'm going to get Coulson . - Ward ! - We 've been made ! - Grenade ! Coulson , we gotta jump ! - ( DEVICE CHARGING UP ) - The train . It just ... - Yep . Vanished . Which , I might add , not easy . I told Simmons I 'd come back for them . May 's there . They 'll be okay . No , she 's not . Is your phone working ? No . Cybertek must 've taken out our electronics . Not a grenade exactly . Might be some kind of cloaking mechanism . Maybe it created some kind of portal . Jumped the train there . Oh , let 's hope not . I can 't deal with Asgard today . Cybertek knew we were coming . How ? Could 've been The Clairvoyant . ( APPROACHING VEHICLES ) We 've got to get back to the plane . Come on . ( SPEAKING ITALIAN ) COULSON : Keys might be in it . It 's the country . People are very trusting in the country . ( ENGINE RUNNING ) It 's running . Yeah , it 's been hotwired . - This is ... - Suspicious ? I was gonna say fortuitous . Let 's get out of here . COULSON : Signore Russo . What happened ? Agent Coulson . Thank God . I 've been trying to reach you . Cybertek knew . They knew we were at the station . They knew we were on the train , too . Most of my team is unaccounted for . Most of my men are dead . Where are you now ? On our plane , we 'll send you the coordinates . And Russo . Do you have any idea what happened to the train ? - What do you mean ? - It vanished . With our team still on it . Okay . We 'll look into that . I 'm on my way to you now , maybe together we can find some answers , yes ? - What now ? - I 'll call H.Q. You take this . We need to figure out what the hell happened to that train . Holotable , on . Holotable , activate . Okay . - Oh . - ( BEEPS ) Really ? ( SIGHS ) Ah . S.H.I. E.L.D. Pulled satellite images . - And ? - Train 's gone . They 're checking alternate routes . If it 's somewhere on Earth , we 'll find it . It 's pretty tricky , right ? I couldn 't even find the " on " button . Can you zoom in ? I think Fitz-Simmons do something more like ... Damn . Let 's just upload the specs to H.Q. - Good idea . - Yeah . Oh , uh . Sir ? This probably isn 't the best time , but what May told you ... I would have preferred it stay between me and her . Well , " It " is happening on my bus . Amongst members of my team . No , we 've never done ... It 's never happened on the bus , sir . You wanna do this now ? Okay , what you 're doing is against protocol so , if you endanger an operation , or if anyone gets hurt , I 'll reassign you to Barrow , Alaska . And you 'll spend the rest of your years pulling the night shift guarding Blonsky 's cryo-cell . Am I clear ? I 'll take that as a yes . And if it 's really just sex , Ward , you should get more comfortable using the word . Agent Coulson . It 's gonna be all right . We found your people . The train , it 's ... ( GRUNTS ) Wheels up in five . ( BRAKES HISSING ) ( P.A. PLAYS TONE ) ( RECORDED ANNOUNCEMENT IN ITALIAN ) As we round the bend , the passengers on the north side of the train can take in the views of the famous Tre Cime di Lavaredo . Isn 't it a wonder ? Ward , you 're up . - Ward ? - ( INTERFERENCE ON COMMS ) Something 's wrong . Cybertek 's leaving the dining car . Ward ? Coulson ... - ( GUNSHOT ) - ( GRUNTS ) Fitz ? Skye ? Can anyone read me ? ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) I 've gotta get you guys somewhere safe . ( ENGINE SPUTTERING ) ( ENGINE IGNITES ) We 've been looking for you , Agent May . ( MEN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ) ( GASPING ) ( PANTING ) Get your bearings , sweetheart . Get your bearings . There you go . There you go . I realize you 're confused . But I 'm here to help . You see , I make sure Cybertek products move across Italy without incident , they make sure I 'm well taken care of . And they 'll take care of you , too . All you have to do is tell me where Agent Coulson and Ward are . That 's it . Why are you smiling ? You called me sweetheart . Fine . Have it your way . Just remember , your boss asked to be a part of this op . I warned him against it . So if you 're looking for someone to blame , look to him . ( GRUNTS ) That 's just what I needed . ( SPEAKING ITALIAN ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GUNSHOT ) ( ENGINE STARTING ) Russo ! And if it 's really just sex , Ward , you should get more comfortable using the word . Agent Coulson . It 's gonna be all right . We found your people . The train , it 's ... Wheel 's up in five . You okay ? You were on the train when it disappeared . May . Russo was ... Explain yourself , please . The train didn 't disappear . Russo sold us out . Get the plane ready . I need a shower . You 're hurt . Let me stitch you up . I said get the plane ready . ( GRUNTING ) Let me help . You know , we have this stuff for a reason . S.H.I. E.L.D. Found the train . Turns out it switched tracks shortly after we got off . The grenade must 've released some kind of toxin , made us believe no time had passed . Yeah , I saw you guys frozen on the field . You looked ridiculous . It wasn 't supposed to be a combat op . They 'll be fine . They can handle themselves . I got it . Gently . Okay . Thank you . Did he get you anywhere else ? ( SCOFFS ) We need to re-route the plane . Just got word from S.H.I. E.L. D that the train stopped suddenly in the Italian countryside . What ? Why ? We 'll find out soon . I 'll set the coordinates . Touchdown in 10 . - I 'll come help . - I got it . ( SPEAKING ITALIAN ) Got parked here 15 minutes ago . Agents on the ground have no idea why . Any sign of Fitz-Simmons and Skye ? No . ( MAN SPEAKING ON RADIO ) Everyone , get down ! Simmons ! Stop ! ( PANTING ) Where are Fitz and Skye ? ( BRAKES HISSING ) ( P.A. PLAYS TONE ) ( RECORDED ANNOUNCEMENT IN ITALIAN ) As we round the bend , the passengers on the north side of the train ... I wish we had more time to take in the scenery . Three peaks of Lavaredo . They 're supposed to be stunning . Any chance what 's in there could be an 084 ? This ? No . We may not know what it is , but we do know that it came from Cybertek . Right . Unknown origin . The one we found in Peru was a machine , - but they don 't always have to be , right ? - No . No , I 've read about all kinds . Weapons , spacecraft , energy sources . I suppose the only thing they really do have in common is that they 're dangerous . Right . Hey , whatever this package turns out to be , we 'll deal with it . Like we always do . We 've faced worse and made it through . Fitz , have you ever heard of an 084 being a person ? No . Although I suppose it 's possible . Hate to meet the guy . - ( INTERFERENCE ON COMMS ) - Whoa . May 's goggles are offline . When did that happen ? May , do you copy ? All comms and phones are dead . Someone 's using some sort of electronic scrambler . Cybertek knows we 're here . I have to warn our team . Fitz ! Get down . ( BOTH GRUNTING ) - ( DEVICE POWERING UP ) - We 've been made ! Oh , bloody hell ! Jemma ! Ahhh ! Oh , my God . She 's okay . ( PANTING ) Okay , hold her up . There we go . I think this is some form of dendrotoxin . The same stuff that 's in the Night-Night gun ? Yeah , but it 's clearly evolved . I think they made it airborne . Is that why their eyes are open ? I suppose if they 're in some sort of black sleep , that would make sense . We gotta get out of here . Find the others and figure out what to do next . Yeah , help me move Simmons first . Can 't just leave her like this . Look at her little face . She 'd be so embarrassed . We should leave her with something to protect herself . Just in case . Yeah . I have a spare . What about him ? That 's for Simmons . ( BRAKES SCREECHING ) Train stopped . I know . And I looked everywhere . May , Ward , and Coulson are gone . What about Cybertek ? They have the package , Fitz . What do we do ? We 're the only ones left . Do you have an extra tracker ? Of course . Then we follow them . Hey . FITZ : Coulson was right . Cybertek led us to Quinn . Activate the tracker . Let them know we 're here . You want to go in ? We can 't let Quinn get away again . If Coulson were here , he wouldn 't let that happen . He wouldn 't want us to let that happen . You 're right . Let 's do it . Can you disable their cars ? With my bare hands . Take this . - You 'll need it out here . - Just take it . Be careful , okay ? You too . Okay . ( RUSTLING ) ( BEEPS ) Find Mr. Quinn . Tell him his purchase is downstairs . ( SPEAKING ITALIAN ) - Mike ? - MAN : Hello . ( GASPS ) Skye . The Clairvoyant told me to expect you . Signore Quinn , this is the same gun as the specs you gave us . You guys have been looking at us . Well , we 've been looking at you . And we found a handful of some particularly interesting things . Mike . Oh , God . You 're alive . That 's right . You two know each other . Hey . Do you know who I am ? And you have your orders ? Good . Because I purchased something that 's gonna help you complete them . ( CHUCKLES ) Orders ? Mike . What is happening here ? Mike . Stand , please . Ahhh ! Mancini , thank you . You will be receiving your payment shortly . That is the best money can buy , my friend . Every piece of technology in you is top of the line . I just wonder if I 'm getting my money 's worth . I know you get your orders from The Clairvoyant . So that means you 're not allowed to hurt me , right ? No . What if I tried to hurt you ? Would you stop me ? No . I would not . Mike , listen . I don 't know what they 're doing to you , but we have to get out of here . Now . And if I wanted you to hurt her ? You know , to kill her , will you ? I mean , what would hurt Agent Coulson more than to lose his pet project ? Those aren 't my orders . She 's not who I 'm supposed to kill . Wait . Wait . Wait ! - What the hell did you do to him ? - ( GUNSHOT ) ( VOICE TREMBLING ) ( SHUSHING ) - ( GUNSHOT ) - ( GASPS ) I 'm sorry . I have my orders , too . Help . ( GROANING ) - Where 's Quinn ? - Where 's our money ? There is no money . You failed . It looks like it 's working to me . ( SPEAKING ITALIAN ) Apparently , there 's been a misunderstanding . We delivered the package as promised . If we can just speak to Mr. Quinn ... ( CHOKING ) The Clairvoyant isn 't happy . You led S.H.I. E.L.D. Right to us . Let her go . - ( GLASS SHATTERING ) - ( THUDDING ) ( INDISTINCT SHOUTING ) ( GUNFIRE ) Skye . ( WEAPON FIRES ) Where 's Skye ? She didn 't want to let Quinn get away . ( GRUNTING ) Help . Help . Help . Driver 's not answering . Oh , Coulson 's team finally got here . Where 's Skye ? You know , Agent Coulson , it 's dangerous to keep sending her in like that , all alone . When she means so much to you . Search the house . Find her ! Now ! Oh ... No . Oh , no . Oh , God . Simmons ! Get down here ! Oh , God . Hang on . Just hang on , okay ? Oh , God . She 's been shot . Keep her upright . I got no pulse . She 's lost too much blood . Put her in there . - Do you even know what this thing is ? - It 's a hyperbaric chamber . And I said , put her in there . Now . - Okay . - Let 's go . ( GRUNTING ) All right . Gentle . I need to get her temperature down , Fitz . Yeah , okay , I got it . - Temperature 's dropping . - Pressure 's stabilizing . Is it working ? Is it working ? For now . Her core temperature 's hovering around 44 degrees Fahrenheit . If we don 't bring her back up to temp in the next few hours , she could sustain permanent brain damage . We need to get her to a medical facility , and fast . Until then , I 'll do everything I can to keep her alive . Excuse me . ( CRYING ) ( YELLS ) It 's not your fault . She never should 've gone in there alone . Blaming yourself won 't help her . I 'm not blaming myself . Ripped By mstoll

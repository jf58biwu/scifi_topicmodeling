 Subtitle created by - Aorion - " Prometheus ( 2012 ) Extended.Fan.Cut.PROPER " ^ ( Run time 02 : 31 : 17 ) I am a law only for my kind , I am no law for all . I am a law only for my kind , I am a law only for my kind , I am no law for all . Ladies and gentlemen , our today 's speaker ... TE Lawrence , eponymously of Arabia , but very much an Englishman favored pinching a burning match between his fingers to put it out . When asked by his colleague , William Potter , to reveal his trick ... how is it he so effectively extinguished the flame without hurting himself whatsoever , Lawrence just smiled and said , " The trick , Potter , is not minding it hurts . The fire that danced at the end of that match was a gift from the Titan , Prometheus , a gift that he stole from the gods , who were terrified of what we might do with it were it to fall into our hairy little paws . When Prometheus was caught and brought to justice for his theft , the gods , well , you might say they overreacted a little . The poor man was tied to a rock as an eagle ripped through his belly and ate his liver over and over , day after day , ad infinitum . All because he gave us fire , our first true piece of technology : Fire . Such a very long time ago , which begs the question what have we done with it ? 100,000 BC : Stone tools . 4,000 BC : The wheel . 800 BC : Sundial . 9th century AD : Gunpowder . Bit of a game-changer , that one . 1441 : The printing press only slightly less impactful . 19th century : Steam engine . Railway . Eureka ! The light bulb ! 20th century : The automobile , television , nuclear weapons , space craft , internet . 21st century : Biotech , nanotech , fusion and fission and M-theory and that was just the first decade . We are now 3 months into the year of our Lord , 2023 . At this moment in our civilization , we 're on the verge of terraforming planets undiscovered just a decade ago . We have identified the genetic chain of events behind 98 % of cancers . A chain we have broken effectively curing them . We can create cybernetic individuals who , in just a few short years , will be completely indistinguishable from us . Which leads to an obvious conclusion : We are the gods now . I haven 't been struck down , I 'll take that to mean I 'm right . We wield incredible power . The power to transform , to destroy and to create again . The question of course before us is , " What the hell are we supposed to do with this power ? " or more importantly one should ask , " What are we allowed to do with this power ? " The answer to that my friends ... is nothing . Rules , restrictions , laws , ethical guideline , all but forbidding us from moving forward . Well , where were the ethics during the Arabian conflicts ? Why are rules preventing us from feeding impoverished cultures ? How is there a law that states if we build a man from wires and metal , the man who will never grow old , who will never feel the heat of a star or the cold of the moon , how is the creation of such an incredible individual considered unnatural ? The answer to all these questions is simple . These rules exist because the people who created them were afraid of what would happen if they didn 't . Well , I am not afraid . For those of you who know me , you will be aware by now that my ambition is unlimited . You know that I will settle for nothing short of greatness , or I will die trying . For those of you who do not yet know me , allow me to introduce myself : My name is Peter Weyland . And if you 'll indulge me , I 'd like to change the world . Get Charlie . Dr. Holloway ! Charlie ! What ? Come quick ! Did you date it ? 35,000 years . Maybe older . Hmm . You gotta be kidding me . It 's the same configuration . I mean , it 's gotta predate the others by millennia . I think they want us to come and find them . Yeah . What happened to that man ? He died . Why aren 't you helping them ? They don 't want my help . Their god is different than ours . Why did he die ? 'Cause sooner or later , everyone does . Like Mummy ? Like Mummy . Where do they go ? Everyone has their own word . Heaven . Paradise . Whatever it 's called , it 's someplace beautiful . How do you know it 's beautiful ? Because that 's what I choose to believe . And what do you believe , Ellie ? Good morning , David . Transmitting message . No response . Whilst this manner of articulation is attested in the Indo-European descendants as a purely paralinguistic form , it is phonemic in the ancestral form dating back five millennia or more . Now let 's attempt Schleicher 's fable . Repeat after me . Hjewis jasma twaelna nahast akwunsaz dadrkta ! Hjewis , jasma , twaelna nahast , akwunsaz , dadrkta . Perfect . - Mr. Lawrence ? - Yes ? Flimsy , sir . Thank you . You do that once too often . It 's only flesh and blood . Michael George Hartley , you 're a philosopher . And you 're barmy . Oh ! It damn well hurts . Certainly , it hurts . Well , what 's the trick , then ? The trick , William Potter , is not minding that it hurts . " The trick , William Potter , is not minding that it hurts . " " The trick , William Potter , is not minding that it hurts . " Attention . Destination threshold . Attention . Destination threshold . Attention . Destination thresh ... Robe . How long ? Two years , four months , 18 days , 36 hours , 15 minutes . Any casualties ? Casualties , ma 'am ? Has anyone died ? No , ma 'am . Everyone 's fine . Well , then , wake them up . Try to relax , Dr. Shaw . My name is David . Your mind and body are in a state of shock as a result of the stasis . It 's all right , perfectly normal . Ellie ... We 're here , baby . There , there . Drink plenty of water . Drink plenty of fluids . Hydration aids muscle mass . All crew , consume shakes with high caloric content . What the hell is that ? It 's Christmas . Need the holidays to show time is still moving . The last I checked , time is always moving . First trip into the deep , huh ? Mission briefing is about to start , Captain . Might want to make your way down . Well , I haven 't had my breakfast yet . Don 't you want to know why we 're here ? No , ma 'am . I just fly the ship . Thought that 's why you people hired me . T 'is the season to be jolly , boys . Is this seat taken ? Hi . I 'm Millburn , biology . Nice to meet you . Ingest protein packs provided ... Okay . Look , uh , no offense , but , uh ... I 've been asleep two years . I ain 't here to be your friend . I 'm here to make money . You got that ? Okay . I bet 100 credits it 's a terraforming survey . No , if it 's a survey , they would just tell us . This is a corporate run . They 're not telling us shit . Come on . Hundred . All right , you 're on . You look nervous , El . I 'll try to keep my feet on the ground . I know you will . Good morning . For those of you I hired personally , it 's nice to see you again . For the rest of you , I am Meredith Vickers , and it 's my job to make sure you do yours . Okay , then . On with the show . Weyland Corporation . Building better worlds . Hello , friends . My name is Peter Weyland . I am your employer . I am recording this 22 June , 2091 . And if you 're watching it , you have reached your destination and I am long dead . May I rest in peace . There 's a man sitting with you today . His name is David . And he is the closest thing to a son I will ever have . Unfortunately , he is ... he 's not human . He will never grow old , and he will never die . And yet he is unable to appreciate these remarkable gifts , for that would require the one thing that David will never have ... a soul . I have spent my entire lifetime contemplating the questions : Where do we come from ? What is our purpose ? What happens when we die ? And I have finally found two people who have convinced me they 're on the verge of answering them . Doctors Holloway and Shaw , if you would please stand . As far as you 're concerned , they 're both in charge . The Titan , Prometheus , wanted to give mankind equal footing with the gods , and for that , he was cast from Olympus . Well , my friends , the time has finally come for his return . Doctors , please . The floor is yours . Okay . Uh , wow . All right . Never had to follow a ghost before . Okay , let me show you why you guys are here . These are images of archeological digs from all over the Earth . That 's Egyptian , Mayan , Sumerian , Babylonian , that 's Hawaiian there at the end , then Mesopotamian . Now , this one here is our most recent discovery . It 's a 35,000-year-old cave painting from the Isle of Skye in Scotland . These are ancient civilizations . They were separated by centuries , they shared no contact with one another , and yet ... The same pictogram , showing men worshipping giant beings , pointing to the stars , was discovered at every last one of them . And the only galactic system that matched was so far from Earth that there 's no way that these , these primitive , ancient civilizations could have possibly known about it . But it just so happens ... that that system has a sun a lot like ours . And based on our long-range scans , there seemed to be a planet ... just one planet ... with a moon capable of sustaining life . And we arrived there this morning . So you 're saying we 're here because of a map you two kids found in a cave . Is that right ? - No . - Yeah . Um ... No . Not a map , an invitation . From who ? We call them Engineers . Engineers ? Do you mind , um , telling us what they engineered ? They engineered us . Bullshit . Okay , so , uh , do you have anything to back that up ? You know , I-I mean , look , if you 're willing to discount three centuries of Darwinism , that 's ... Whoo ! But how do you know ? Hmm ? I don 't . But it 's what I choose to believe . Doctors . Miss Vickers would like to have a quick word , before the adventure begins . Wow , nice place . It 's actually a separate module , with its own self-contained life support . Air , food ... anything Miss Vickers would need to survive a hostile environment . Okay , so she lives on a lifeboat . Yes . I do . I like to minimize risk . David , why don 't you make the doctors a drink . I 'll take a vodka . Up . Charlie , look . It 's a Pauling Med-Pod . They only made a dozen of these . Miss Shaw . Please verbally state the nature of your injury . Please don 't touch that . It 's a very expensive piece of machinery . It does bypass surgery . What do you need it for ? I think there might be some confusion about our relationship . Weyland found you impressive enough to fund this mission , but I 'm fairly certain your Engineers are nothing but scribblings of savages living in dirty little caves . But let 's say I 'm wrong , and you do find these beings down there . You won 't engage them , you won 't talk to them , you will do nothing but report back to me . Um , Miss Vickers , is there an agenda that you 're not telling us about ? My company paid a trillion dollars to find this place and to bring you here . Had you raised the monies yourself , Mr. Holloway , we 'd happily be pursuing your ... agenda . But you didn 't . And that makes you an employee . But if we , if we can 't make contact , why did you , why did you even bring us here ? Weyland was a superstitious man . He wanted a true believer on board . Cheers . So , no response . I 'm sorry , no . Maybe they didn 't understand it . How are your lessons going , David ? I spent two years deconstructing dozens of ancient languages to their roots . I 'm confident I can communicate with them , provided your thesis is correct . Provided it 's correct . That 's good . That 's why they call it a thesis , Doctor . What are you smiling about ? All right , Mr. Ravel , Mr. Chance , let 's take her down . - Roger that . - Yes , Captain . Descent trajectory mapped . How we doing ? Great . All right , boss . All personnel , this is the Captain . Brace for entry . Yes , Captain . That means you too , Vickers . All systems online . What is the atmosphere ? Atmosphere is 71 % nitrogen , 21 % oxygen , traces of argon gas . Whoa , now that 's weather . Just like home . Only if you 're breathing through an exhaust pipe . CO2 's over three percent . Two minutes without a suit , you 're dead . Peak , port side ... Whoa , 52,000 . Makes Everest look like a baby brother . All right , take us around . Gonna use that as our point of entry . Terrain data rezzing up . We got a couple of hard spots . Could be metal . No radio , no heat source . Nobody 's home . " There is nothing in the desert , and no man needs nothing . " What was that ? Just something from a film I like . Let 's go through that gateway . Reduce air speed by a hundred knots . Going through . Nice and slow . Keep it steady , boys . There . No , what are you doing ? Dr. Holloway , why don 't you take a seat . Okay ... Right there . God does not build in straight lines . Starboard side , this valley ! Captain , do you think you can put us down there ? Yeah , I wouldn 't be any good if I couldn 't do that . Mr. Ravel , starboard 90 degrees . One mile , port bow . One mile , port bow . Engage landing sequence . - Switch to manual . - Commence landing . - Easy does it . - Roger that . Yeah , baby , yeah . Bringing her down in five ... - Preparing to fire RCS thrusters . - ... four two ... Easy does it . Generator systems are inactive . Temperature is at 2.725 K. Isotherm evaluation in progress . Plant cover is minimal . Captain , would you please tell the survey team to suit up and meet us in the airlock . There 's only six hours left of daylight . - Why don 't you leave it till the morning ? - Oh , no , no , no . It 's Christmas , Captain , and I want to open my presents . You , boy , you 're coming with us . I 'd be delighted . Attention , ramp will open in five minutes . Hey , Jackson , what 's that for ? Expedition security . My job 's to make sure everybody 's nice and safe . This is a scientific expedition . No weapons . All right , then . Good luck with that . Core body temperature 98.6 . David , why are you wearing a suit , man ? I beg your pardon ? You don 't breathe , remember ? So , why wear a suit ? I was designed like this , because you people are more comfortable interacting with your own kind . If I didn 't wear the suit , it would defeat the purpose . They 're making you guys pretty close , huh ? Not too close , I hope . Attention , ramp will open in 15 seconds . - Ramp will open in five , - Good luck . ... four , three , two , one . Hey ... this is just one small step for mankind . Seriously ? Whoo ! Come on ! You ready to do this ? I know you are . Hey , Fifield , I want a spectrograph on that structure . I want to know if it 's natural or if somebody put it there , all right ? I can 't tell you if it 's natural or not . But what I can tell you is , it 's hollow . Prometheus ... are you seeing this ? Affirmative . We see it . - You ready ? - Yeah . Let 's do it . Barometric pressure : 29.92 . - After you . - After you . - Okay . - Careful . Prometheus , we 're going in . Copy that . What 's back here ? Some kind of a corridor ? Mr. Fifield , let 's get a grid of the structure . I want the whole interior . If there 's anything in here worth looking at , these pups will find them . " Pups " ? Yeah , pups . My pups . Prometheus , we 're now mapping . Copy that . Never seen anything like this . Well , I 'll be damned . Fifield , you got a read ? Yeah , uh , pups are saying , " This way . " Look at this . Oh , Charlie . Jesus . Sunlight 's heating the water . Check out the humidity . Yeah . And look at the CO2 levels . Outside , it 's completely toxic , and in ... in here , there 's nothing . It 's breathable . What are you doing ? - Charlie , don 't be an idiot . - Babe , don 't be a skeptic . Right , there 's something generating an atmosphere . David ? Dr. Holloway is correct . Cleaner than Earth , actually . They were terraforming here . - Please , don 't do that ... - Look , Ellie ... - Charlie , please don 't . - Ellie , I 'm not wearing this thing anymore . - Holloway , do not depressurize . - Wish me luck , baby . Do you copy ? Do not remove your headgear . Whoo ! You crazy bastard . Prometheus , connect our suit cameras if you want to continue watching this freak show . We are taking our helmets off . Copy that . Switching feeds . Well , come on . Pay up . Pay , pay what ? What do you mean , " pay what " ? Something 's manufacturing breathable air down there . That , mate , is terraforming . No , no , no , no . The bet was why we came here . If you said the dead old man wanted to talk to Martians , then I 'd pay you . Oh , come on ! A hundred credits . Put it towards a lap dance with Miss Vickers . How about that , eh ? Oh my god . Oh my god . Guys . Oh my god . Oh my god . Ellie . You 'd want to see this . Look at this . Look at this beautiful thing . In all the systems we 've ever cataloged , we 've never found anything larger than bacteria . But this ... This is life . We found life . Come here , baby , come on . Come on . Come on . Our first alien . I guess we 're really lucky we brought you , little bun biology . It 's minus-12 in here . So why is this water not frozen ? Maybe it ain 't water . Maybe it 's Martian piss . That 's your , um , scientific theory , is it , Mr. Biology ? Well , whatever it is , it sure is collagenous . Some kind of sediment , perhaps . Impressive . Huh ? Uh , what was that ? David ? David ? What is that ? David ? Ellie ! What the hell was that ? Oh , I 'm really glad we didn 't bring any weapons . Come on , El . Let 's go . Whose idea was that ? Keep up ! Come on ! Where did he go ? Wait , wait . There it is . There it is . There it is . Ellie . Oh , my God , Charlie . We found them . What do you mean " them " ? It is them , Ellie . Looks like a door , and he 's been decapitated by it . Son of a bitch . They were right . What , did you want them to be wrong ? David , please tell me you can read that . Perhaps . No , I 'm , uh , I 'm out of here . Hey , Fifield , where are you going ? What ? Look , I 'm just a geologist . I like rocks ... I love rocks ! Now , it 's clear you two don 't give a shit about rocks . But what you do seem to care about is gigantic dead bodies . And as I don 't really have anything to contribute in the gigantic dead body arena ... I 'm gonna go back to the ship , if you don 't mind . Anyone want to join me , eh ? You staying ? Uh ... No , ship 's good . Yeah . Ship very good . Congratulations on meeting your maker . Thank you . Pull yourself together , man . And I thought you were the crazy one . Do you have the carbon reader ? Thank you . How long has it been dead ? 2,000 years , give or take . What are you doing , David ? I 'm attempting to open the door . Wait . We don 't know what 's on the other side . Oops . Sorry . Look , Ford . It 's the head . An amazing state of preservation . - We 'll take it in . - Yeah . Remarkably human . Beautiful painting . It 's a mural . Stop . Stop . Don 't touch it . Sorry . Please , don 't touch anything . Sweating . Organic . Oh , no . Charlie , the murals are changing . I think we 've affected the atmosphere in the room . Charlie , do you copy ? Oh , the head . Ford , quick , help me bag the head . Boss . What you got ? We got an incoming storm front . Silica and , uh , lots of static . This is not good . I see it . Ground crew , this is Janek . I need you to hustle back right now . Ground crew , do you copy me ? I got 200-kilometer winds of airborne silica and enough static to fry your suit . Copy that , sir . But we need more time here . I 'll be closing the outer doors in 15 minutes . I sincerely hope you can make it . Charlie ! David ! We must leave now . This is just another tomb . David ! - On three . - Two , three , up . Let 's go ! Easy , easy , easy . Careful . David , we are leaving ! Come on . Damn it , they 've already taken off . Come on , let 's go . Get in . Get in . Prometheus to ground crew . You 're running out of time . I repeat , you 're running out of time . All right , come on . Let 's go . Go faster ! - Charlie , the head ! - Close the door ! Get in here ! Ellie , no ! What are you doing ? Shut the hatch ! You got to close your door ! Hatch closure in five seconds . Shit . Damn it ! Hold on ! Goddamn it . Door closing ! Ellie , don 't move ! Charlie ! Grab my hand ! No ! No , Ellie ! Ellie ! Got it . Decontamination at level three . So , what was that , Ellie ? Huh ? You could have compromised the entire mission , not to mention almost killing yourself . - Are you all right ? - Yes . Thank you , David . My pleasure . All right , doctors , it 's real good to have you back , but where 's Millburn and Fifield ? Aren 't they back yet ? - Get them up for me . - All right . - Hey , what 's that ? - What ? Here . See . I don 't know . - What is that ? What 're you doing ? - Oh , don 't pick it up . - Why ? It 's like breaking apart . Oh my god . What 're you doing ? Oh . Looks like skin or something . Let 's just leave it alone now , come on . Millburn , just ... just go , yes ? We 've been here before , Fifield . I don 't know . All looks the same to me . Boys , this is the Captain . Listen up . Between the static electricity and the wind speed , well , there ain 't no safe way to come get you . What ? Now , the temperature is dropping rapidly , so get your helmets on and stay warm until the storm passes . Captain , can you get a message to the scientist and that zealot girlfriend of his ? - Mm-hmm . - You got a pen nearby ? No , no . Think we got it . Tell them I said ... ... themselves . - Copy ? - Copy that . All right , boys , well , keep your head down and we 'll come get you in the morning . Well , which way now , huh ? All right . Well , which way , huh ? A woman in Africa told me the story how the world came to be . She said ... First there was the sun . But it had no one to shine on . So , the sun made man . And man looks up at the sun and asked . Why did you make me ? And the sun said , " Because I was alone . " My whole life , I 've been looking for what we 've found today . We 're not alone anymore . Cheers . - Cheers . - Cheers . Well do me a favor , next time you see a storm run the other way . I dropped my head . Well , as much as I respect your suicidal passion , why the hell did you go back for it ? Because it proves that we 're here . It 's the only way we can find out what killed them . Hey , who cares what killed them , right ? - What 's wrong with you ? - What 's wrong with me ? - Yeah . - Ellie . They 're all dead . So , so , so ... So , that means that we all are alone . Doctors . The specimen 's prepped . We 're all ready for you . Specimen , mm-mm . No . No , Ellie . I didn 't come all this way for for an autopsy . Remember we were supposed to talk to them . So ... Okay , sample is sterile . No contagion present . David . So , are they all dead ? What ? Who ? Your Engineers . Are they all dead , or aren 't they ? I don 't know . We just got here . Scan . Do you even care if they 're all dead ? Weyland cared . Dr. Shaw . Have a look at this . - That 's not an exoskeleton . - No . I think it 's a helmet . - Let 's see if we can lift it up . - Yeah . We should be able to pry this open . It 's too heavy for us . David ? Careful . Like so . What ... what is that on its head ? It looks like new cells . - In a state of ... - Change . Yes . Changing into what ? Can you run a stem line into the locus coeruleus ? I-I think we can trick the nervous system into thinking it 's still alive . - 30 amps . - Okay . No more . Let me make an incision . Okay . Go up 40 . Okay , 40 up . Did you see that ? - Yes . - Yeah . See ? Go up another ten . Okay , up ten . Maybe it 's a little bit too ... too much . - Jesus . - Go down ten . - Okay , down ten . - Down another 20 . I am . Okay , I 'm trying . - I 'm trying . It 's not going down . - Full down . Ford , stop it . Oh , God . David , contain it ! Now ! Contain it ? Turn it off now ! Oh , God . The smell . Oh , God , look at that . Look at that . It 's getting worse . Mortal after all . Ford , take a sample . Let 's have a look . No , sir . I will take care of it . Yes , sir . Understood . I 'm sorry . Fortunately , slightly premature . Of course , sir . Miss Vickers . What did he say , David ? I don 't think he 'd want me to tell you . What did he say ? I 'm sorry . That 's confidential . So help me God , I will find the cord that makes you run , and I will cut it . What did he say ? He said ... " Try harder . " Cup of tea , ma 'am ? Genetic view . Okay . Let 's have a look at its DNA . Isolate the strand . Okay . Compare it to the gene sample . Yeah . Overlay . Processing . Processing . DNA match . Oh , my God . It 's us . It 's everything . What killed them ? " Big things have small beginnings . " Am I interrupting ? I thought you might be running low . Pour yourself a glass , pal . Thank you , but I 'm afraid it would be wasted on me . Oh . Oh , right . I almost forgot you 're not a real boy , huh ? I 'm very sorry that your Engineers are all gone , Dr. Holloway . You think we wasted our time coming here , don 't you ? Your question depends on me understanding what you hoped to achieve by coming here . What we hoped to achieve was to meet our makers . To get answers . Why they ... Why they even made us in the first place . Why do you think your people made me ? We made you ' cause we could . Can you imagine how disappointing it would be for you to hear the same thing from your creator ? I guess it 's a good thing you can 't be disappointed , huh ? Yes . It 's wonderful , actually . May I ask you something ? Please do . How far would you go to get what you came all this way for ? Your answers . What would you be willing to do ? Anything and everything . That 's worth drinking to , I 'd imagine . Here 's mud in your eye , pal . Good health . It 's those things . Are they real ? Of course , they 're real . Jesus Christ . Look at the pile . Look how high up they are . Yeah , looks like they were running from something . Okay . Don 't touch , okay ? I mean , this thing is opened up from the inside . Almost like it exploded . Looks like a scene out some sort of holocaust painting , you know ? Well ... So , whatever killed them is long gone , right ? Millburn , Fifield , this is Prometheus . What is your position ? Prometheus , this is Millburn . Uh ... We are at 740-1477 . Why ? Just got a ping about one click west of you . What-what do you mean , " a ping " ? Well , whatever that probe is picking up , it 's not dead . It 's reading a life-form . What ... ? Okay , what do you mean , " a life-form " ? Is it ... is it moving ? No , I don 't think so . Uh , Captain , you 're , uh ... you 're obviously not seeing , uh , what we 're seeing down here . But if you were , you wouldn 't be talking about a bloody ping , yeah ? I know , boys . Your signal has been coming in sporadically since the storm hit . That 's no good to us down here , Captain ! Is it ... Is it moving ? Are these things moving ? No . No , it just disappeared , actually . Must be a glitch . What do you mean , " a glitch " ? All right , boys . Sleep tight . Try not to bugger each other . Captain , what do you mean , " a glitch " ? Millburn , what-what ... what does he mean ? Wait . He said ... He said ... one click west ? - Yeah . - Yeah , okay . Now , we ... we don 't want to go check that out , do we , huh ? Shit , no . So , where are we going to go ? East . Yeah , east . Fucking glitch , man . Pings , glitch , life-form . What the fuck ? You 're drunk . Hi . You 're embarrassing , Charlie . Wow . You know , he seemed pretty scared for a ghost . He 's not a ghost . Oh yeah , what is it ? It 's a recording . Some kind of videolog . We must have triggered it when we came in . So , let me ask you a question . How come there 's not a " recording " of ... whatever was chasing it ? Look at him . He knew he was about to die . Mm . Maybe nothing was chasing him . Maybe . Maybe there was an outbreak . What is that based on , Ellie ? I 've seen it before . This isn 't Africa , Ellie . It 's outer space . I saw his head explode . - A couple of hours ago . - Uh-huh . I know infection when I see it , Charlie . You know that . There was something inside it . Something on a cellular level , maybe even genetic . Who cares , honey . It doesn 't matter , okay ? It 's not why we came here , Ellie . And finding out what killed a bunch of god damn aliens 2,000 years ago , it changes nothing . What-What do you want to change ? You ... You saw that face - underneath that helmet , Ellie . - Yeah . Yeah . They are not gods . We 're just some experiment . And the Earth was a god damn petri dish . That 's it . You 're never going to prove that with a bunch of 2,000 year old mummies . Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay , fine . So , why are you here , huh ? What did you travel light years to get here , to ask for , huh ? What , for the meaning of life ? What , for forgiveness for your sins , hm ? Or , or maybe to ask god why he traded you for your mom . Or , or maybe uh ... Maybe to ask him why he took your father ? Elizabeth , I 'm sorry . Stop it . Stop . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Oh . How much longer is this gonna take ? I don 't know . I 'm just the captain . That thing sounds like a dying cat , by the way . I 'll have you know that this " thing " once belonged to Stephen Stills . Am I supposed to know who that is ? You know ... if you want to get laid , you really don 't have to pretend to be interested in the pyramid scan . I mean , you could just say , " Hey , I 'm trying to get laid . " I could , I could say that , right ? But then , it wouldn 't make sense why I would fly myself a half a billion miles from every man on Earth if I wanted to get laid , would it ? Hey , uh , Vickers . Hey , Vickers . I was wondering ... Are you a robot ? My room . Ten minutes . Well , if you can 't be With the one you love Love the one you 're with ... Love the one you 're with . Millburn , what 's all this black stuff ? Mmm ! Gazpacho . Is that tobacco ? - Huh ? - Is that tobacco in your respirator ? Yeah , sure . Tobacco . On behalf of scientists everywhere , I am ashamed to count you amongst us , Fifield , really . Hey , Millburn . - Yeah ? - You see this thing ? What do you think this thing was , huh ? Some kind of a god ? Something they worshipped , or what ? - I don 't know . Kind of looks like a ... - What 's that ? - What the hell is that ? - Oh ! Oh , my God . Okay . - Okay . Just stay calm . Stay quiet . - Jesus , Millburn ! - What is it ? - This is okay . I can handle this . Hey , baby . Hey . Uh , come in , Prometheus . Uh , we have a elongate reptile-type creature .

All right , storm 's passed , but can 't reach Millburn or Fifield on the comm . Taking a few men down , see if I can rustle them up . Okay . Uh ... any idea where they are ? Well , last time they radioed in was just outside where you found your head . Okay , we 're coming . All right . Chance , coming with me . - Come on . - All right , boss . - Hey , baby . - Hey . You okay ? Yeah . Yeah . I think I ... just hung over . You sure ? You 're warm . I 'm fine ... Ravel , did you fix that glitch ? No , Captain , it 's got to be in the hardware . What glitch , Captain ? One of them probes picked up a life-form . Pops up every hour or so for a couple of seconds , and then it 's gone . I can find the probe and fix it for you , if you like . Knock yourself out . Ramp will open in three ... - Be careful , Doctors . - ... two ... one . Fifield ? ! Millburn ? ! All right , come on down . David ? Are you alone ? Yes , Miss Vickers . Uplink your feed to my room . Copy . You son of a bitch . You cut me off . Oh . What is this ? Charlie ? I just tripped . Oh , my God , you 're sick , Charlie . I 'm okay , baby . Come on . Fifield ? Millburn ? Hey , Chance . I wouldn 't touch that if I were you . Dr. Shaw ? Yeah ? Do we have any idea what is oozing out of these vases ? No . They weren 't like this last time we were here . Captain ? What ? - Who is it ? Which one ? - Fifield . - Who is it ? - No , it 's Millburn . - Ellie ... - I don 't ... - Don 't touch him . Hold on . - Hey , Ellie ? - Don 't touch him . - Ellie , honey . Charlie , what 's wrong ? Hi , hey , I need you to , I need you to look at me , okay ? You , you know infections , so , what do you , what do you see ? This is not good , baby . You look at me , you tell me what you see . Oh , my God . - Captain ... - Ford , get over here . - It 's okay . Janek ? - Not the way you 're looking at me . - What ? - We have to go now ! - What do you see , baby ? - We got a man down here , Shaw . - Honey , what do you see , huh ? Holloway 's sick . He 's ... he 's not good . I see a movement in his esophagus . Oh my God ! What was that ? ! - Come on , baby . - No , I 'm okay . Janek ! Come over and help me ! - I 'm okay , I 'm okay . - Ford , get over there . - What 's happening over there ? - Easy , easy . - I 'm okay . - Let 's go ! - Help me with him . - I 'm okay . - I got you . - I can do this , Captain . - We 're gonna get you out of here . - I can do this . - Prometheus , come in . - Watch your head . Okay . I 'm okay . Okay . - Holloway ! - All right , get him up , get him up . - Come on . - Prometheus , come in . Is anyone there ? - Help him ! - This is Vickers . I need a medical team standing by the airlock . - Full quarantine fail-safe . - Come on , people ! Holloway 's sick . Sick with what ? - Just do it . - Let 's get him back to the ship . It 's not safe down here . - Charlie ? - I 'm suiting up . - Charlie ? - What 's going on ? Talk to me . - Move ! - What was that thing back there ? Let 's go ! Let 's go ! People ! - Janek ! - We got to move . We got to move . We could all be infected now . Ellie ... - He don 't look too good . - Well , did he catch something down there ? - We had our helmets off . What if ... ? - I don 't know . Prometheus , this is Janek . Make sure that back door is open . All right , Captain . Oh , God . I 'm so sorry . Come on ! Please ! I can 't see you but I know you can hear me , you tin can . Now , report . Yes , Miss Vickers . Better get your ass back here right now . These idiots are about to infect my ship . Of course . Right away . I do apologize . Technical difficulties . Have you located your objective , David ? I believe I have . It 's time . Vickers , why is that door not open ? Vickers , that is an order ! - Get that goddamn door open ! - Honey , I 'm sick . Look at me , okay ? It 's too late . - I 'm sick . - No , it 's not . Come on ! Ford , help me ! Airlock crew , if you can hear me , this is Janek . Open that back door right now ! Hold that door ! Prometheus , do you copy ? Goddamn it , open that door ! That is an order ! Open it . What the hell is this ? He 's not coming on board . - Vickers , this is a sick man . - Baby , come on . I can see that ! That 's why he 's not coming on my ship . Chance , get over here ! Please ! We can still help him ! Help yourself . Everybody but Holloway , back on this ship now . I won 't leave him . Then stay . - Wait a minute . - Please . We can contain him , put him on the Med-Pod . Please don 't do this . It 's okay , Ellie . Vickers . What are you doing ? - I love you , baby . I love you . - No . I 'm telling you , stay back ! - Do it . - Stay back ! No ! No , Charlie ! - Do it . Do it . - No ! No ! Ford ! - No ! - Ford , get over here ! No ! Charlie ! No ! My deepest condolences . I 'm going to have to take this . It may be contaminated . If there 's a contagion , we were all exposed . You-You need to ... we need to run blood work on everyone who set foot in the pyramid . Yes , of course . Yes ? I understand how inappropriate this is given the circumstances , but , as you ordered quarantine fail-safes it 's my responsibility to ask . Have you and Dr. Holloway had any intimate contact recently ? Since you and he were so close , I just want to be as thorough as poss ... My , my . You 're pregnant . Wha ... what ? From the look of it , three months so . No , that 's impossible . I can 't be pregnant . Did you have intercourse with Dr. Holloway ? Yes , but ten hours ago . There 's no bloody way I-I 'm three months pregnant . Well , Doctor , it 's not exactly a traditional fetus . I want to see it . Don 't think that 's a good idea . David , I want to see it . Now , Doctor ... I want to see it . I want it out of me . I 'm afraid we don 't have the personnel to perform a procedure like that . - Our best option is ... - I want it out . ... put you back into cryostasis until we return to Earth . Please , get it out of me . Get it out of me ! Please . It must be very painful . Here , let me give you something . That 's it . There , there . Someone will be along shortly to bring you back to Cryo Deck . Must feel like your God abandoned you . What ? To lose Dr. Holloway after your father died under such similar circumstances . What was it that killed him ? Ebola ? How do ... how do you know that ? I watched your dreams . Are you here to file a report ? No . I 'm not . I 'm really not in the mood for coffee . It 's a good thing it 's rum then . There you go . Please don 't touch that . You know before I sold my soul to corporate I was in the military . Yeah . Before I did that , I was uh ... flying sorties out of Jordan . and uh ... There was one base I was on , had this building . No windows , pure steel . Surrounded by a barbed wire fence . I see small men in white coats going in and out of it . We knew they were making something in there . We knew it was bad . Anyway . One night , the alarm goes and ... we get ordered to do a full evac , everybody out . When I 'm running towards my transport and I see these men in white coats trying to get out that building . screaming , crying for their lives . Turns out that fence wasn 't to keep us out . It was to keep them in . Anyway , we get in the air and I see my CO flipped open a box that he had on his lap , had a gray button on it . And he closes his eyes and he starts to pray . And then 6 kilometers out , he decides to push that button . And-And even that far out we felt the heat of that explosion as 1,100 souls , give or take , vaporized . Just because some idiot spilt something . Now , I know it was a long time ago . But I felt the same thing happened here . Those things . Those Engineers , they made something they shouldn 't have . And they spilt it . And it was your turn to push the button . Why did you decide to tell me that story now ? Because you killed a man today . Looks like you 're in pain . I burned my hand . What the hell was that , Chance ? Boss , we 're getting seismic activity . From where ? Below ground . About 1 click east . Yeah , he 's uh ... he 's right . We 're getting ... Heat signatures , same place . Hey , do you want to tell me what the hell is going on ? Not particularly . Is he awake ? Almost . Is who awake ? That 's not really your concern , Captain . Now , if you could please make sure the rovers are ready to roll within the hour , we 'd appreciate it . Hey . Hey . Hey ! Dr. Shaw ? We 're here to put you in an anti-contamination suit , take you back to Cryo Deck , go to beddy-byes . Dr. Shaw ? She 's totally doped . Prepare her . Emergency procedures initiated . Please verbally state the nature of your injury . I need a Cesarean . Error . This Med-Pod is calibrated for male patients only and does not offer ... - Shit ! - ... the procedure you have requested . Please seek medical assistance else ... Surgery . Abdominal . Penetrating injuries . Foreign body . Initiate . Surgical procedure to begin . Come on . Running diagnostics . Oh , come on . Get it out . Come on ! Please ! Oh , God . Come on ! Initiating anesthetics . Please ! Commence surgical procedure . Oh , God . Oh ! Oh , God . Oh , my God . Oh , God ! Oh , God ! Oh , my God . Come on ! Bridge , uh , to hangar . - This is the Captain . - Yeah , what 's up ? Can you see what I 'm seeing ? Fifield 's monitor just popped up . What ? Where ? Well , according to what I 'm looking at , it 's right outside the goddamn ship . Barnes , open the door . Fifield , do you copy me ? Come on in . Fifield ? Wait a second . Hey , Wallace . Take a look at this . Fifield ? What the hell is going on down there ? I 'm coming down there . Chance , you 're with me . Come on . Come on , get him ! I 'm on it ! I got it ! - You ready , Chance ? - Yes . Fire ! Fire ! Keep at it ! I got it . Punch that , roll it ! Let him go , rolling . You 've been asleep . You were on the ship all this time . Why ? Well , I ... I only have a few days of life left in me here . Didn 't want to waste them till I was sure that you could deliver what you promised : to meet my maker . There we are , sir . - Nice and clean . - Mm . Haven 't you told him they 're all gone ? But they 're not all gone , Dr. Shaw . One of them is still alive . We 're on our way to see him now . What ? Turn me around . You convinced me that if these things made us ... then surely they could save us . My stick , please . Well , save me , anyway . Save you from what ? Death , of course . Stand me up . I 'm all right , I 'm all right . I 'm all right . Yes , sir . But you don 't understand . You don 't know . This place isn 't what we thought it was . They aren 't what we thought they were . I was wrong . We were so wrong . Charlie ... Dr. Holloway 's dead . We must leave ! And what would Charlie do , now ... that we 're so close to answering the most ... meaningful questions ever asked by mankind ? Hmm ? How can you leave without knowing what they are ? Or have you lost your faith , Shaw ? Okay . Okay . Come in . Where ... Where the hell are you going , Doc ? You know what this place is ? Those , uh , Engineers ? This ain 't their home . It 's an installation . Maybe even military . And they put it out here in the middle of nowhere because they 're not stupid enough to make weapons of mass destruction on their own doorstep . That 's what all that shit is in those vases . They made it here . It got out , it turned on them . The end . It 's time for us to go home . One of them is still alive . Don 't you want to know what they have to say ? I don 't care . Right . All you do is fly the ship . - That 's right . - Mm-hmm . But you must care about something , Captain . If you didn 't , why are you here ? How about this . No matter what happens down there , I can 't bring none of that shit back home with us . Can 't let it happen . And I 'll do whatever I have to to see that it doesn 't . Make sure you do , Captain . So , you came after all . I thought you wanted me to come . I did . After all your vigorous attempts to stop me from coming here , I 'm just surprised to see you . If my memory serves , last time we spoke , you said I was nothing but a stupid old fool chasing fairy tales . I shouldn 't have said that . It 's all right , David . Leave us alone . Yes , sir . I 'll be outside if you need me . I am sorry . Well , consider yourself forgiven . What do you want ? I want to say good bye . I 'm sorry ? If you 're really going down there , you 're going to die . Very negative way of looking at things . Maybe you should look at the things squealing next door and tell me how positive ... you feel . You know , Mere , I 've always despised that sarcastic attitude of yours . Exactly why you should 've stayed at home . Did you really think I was gonna sit in a boardroom for years , arguing over who was in charge , while you go look for some miracle in some godforsaken rock in the middle of space ? Did you ? A king has his reign , and then he dies . It 's inevitable . That ... is the natural order of things . My god . Look at you . You used to have so much grace . I respected you . Looked up to you . You 're nothing but a scared old man . And I 'm tired of waiting for that last pitiful breath to leave your godforsaken mouth . Anything else ? No Father . That 's it . I didn 't think you had it in you . Sorry . Poor choice of words . Extraordinary survival instincts , Elizabeth . What happens when Weyland 's not around to program you anymore ? I suppose I 'd be free . You want that ? " Want " , not a concept I 'm familiar with . That being said , doesn 't everyone want their parents dead ? I didn 't . Dr. Shaw . So pleased you could join us . You can take your helmet off if you like , sir . What ? The air is perfectly breathable . You sure ? Positive . Wait . We still don 't know how Holloway got infected . If it 's in the air ... It 's not . How do you know that ? Smells fine to me . Shall we ? Please . The bridge is just up ahead . What is this ? It 's a cargo hold . Janek ? Are you seeing this ? How many is there , Shaw ? Thousands . What the hell ? Ravel , give me those schematics . Putting it on the table now . Strip away the dome . Isolate that area , bring it up . Bringing it up , Captain . Enlarge that . Rotate it . That is a ship . Jesus Christ . It 's a goddamn ship . A superior species , no doubt . Their hyper-sleep chambers will impress , I trust . So , they were traveling somewhere . I 've managed to work out the broad strokes . It 's fairly evident they were in the process of leaving ... before things went to pot . Leaving to go where ? Earth . Why ? Sometimes to create , one must first destroy . Where is he , David ? This way , sir . Are you sure he 's alive ? Absolutely . And you can speak to him ? I believe I can . Speak to him , David . Tell him we came , just like he asked . These people have come here from Earth . They believe that you invited them . I 'm all right , I 'm all right . What do you want ? Why do you come here ? What did he say ? He asked to know why you 're here . Ask him where they 're from . What are you doing ? Ask him what 's in his cargo . It killed his people . Shaw , that 's enough . David . You made it here , and ... and it was meant for us . Why ? Shaw , enough . For God 's sake , shut her up . Why ? Ahh ! I need to know why ! What did we do wrong ? ! Why do you hate us ? ! If she opens her mouth again , shoot her . David , continue . Tell him why I came . They would like to know where do you come from ? This man believes you could give him eternal life . He wants more life ? What makes this man so great as to ask such a thing ? What did he say ? What did he say ? I told him you wanted to live forever . He asked why . Do you ... Do you see this man ? My company built him from nothing . I made him . And I made him in my own image , so that he ... He would be perfect . So that he would never fail . I deserve this . Because you ... You and I , we are superior . We are creators . We are gods . And gods never die . No ! No ! Mr. Weyland . Ford . Move ! Sorry . Ford ! Move ! All right , you ! There 's ... nothing . I know . Have a good journey , Mr. Weyland . Time to go home . Mr. Chance , take us home . Oh , no ! Oh ! Oh , God ! Oh , God ! Hey , Captain . What the hell was that ? Prometheus ! Come in ! Shaw ? Is that you ? Copy ? Janek , listen to me . This ship is taking off ! - What ? - What the hell is she talking about ? You can 't let it leave ! You have to stop it ! We 're not stopping anything , Shaw . We 're going home . Janek , if you don 't stop it , there won 't be any home to go back to . It 's ... it 's carrying death , and it 's headed for Earth . Shaw , this is not a warship . - I know . - Let 's go . I know that . But you must do it . Captain , let 's go ! Janek , please believe me . Please ! I told you to get this ship going . Mr. Ravel , warm up the ion propulsion . What the hell are you talking about ? Sir , burning the ion in the inner atmosphere will ... Turn us into a bullet . That is exactly the point . What the hell are you doing ? Janek , this is my ship ! I 'm telling you to take us home ! Vickers , I 'm gonna eject your life support module onto that surface . That 's two years of life . You want it , or you want to stay with me ? You got 40 seconds to get to the escape pod . You 're crazy . Gentlemen , I can handle this myself . Feel free to join Miss Vickers . All due respect , Captain , you 're a shit pilot , and you 're gonna need all the help you can get . If you can 't be With the one you love , love the one you 're with ... If you think this means the bet 's off you 're wrong . Why don 't you pay me on the other side . Love the one you 're with . All right , get as close as we can . We only got one shot at this . Lifeboat 's away . 20 seconds to evacuate . - Countdown initiated . - Ion propulsion is online . Ten , nine ... Come on ! ... eight ... - All right , gentlemen , let 's do this . - ... three , two ... Impact imminent . Hands off ! Oh , God . No , no . No , no , no , no , no ! Oh , God . Warning . You have two minutes of oxygen remaining . Warning . You have 30 seconds of oxygen remaining . Oxygen level is normal . Testing radio transmission . Dr. Shaw , are you receiving me ? This is David . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , I 'm here . You need to get out immediately . He 's coming for you . Who ? Who 's coming ? - Elizabeth , can you hear me ? - Shit . Got you . I 'm so sorry . Oh , God . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , Charlie . I can 't do it . I can 't do it anymore . Dr. Shaw . Are you there ? Elizabeth , can you hear me ? Yes . Yes , I can hear you . I was afraid you were dead . You have no idea what afraid is . I know we 've had our differences . But please ... I need to ask you for your help . Why the hell would I help you ? Because , without me , you 'll never leave this place . Neither one of us is leaving this place . It 's not the only ship . There are many others . I can operate them . Before that thing ripped your head off , what did he say , David ? " Thing " , Dr. Shaw ? Not too long ago , you considered them gods . God never tried to kill me . So ... What did he say ? Where did he come from ? There is no direct translation , but several of your ancient cultures had a word similar to it . Paradise . Elizabeth ? Dr. Shaw ? Dr. Shaw . Over here . Where is my cross ? The pouch in my utility belt . The other pouch . Even after all this , you still believe , don 't you ? You said you could figure out their navigation , use their maps . Yes , of course . Once we get to one of their other ships , finding a path to Earth should be relatively straightforward . I don 't want to go back to where we came from . I want to go where they came from . I want to go to " Paradise " . You think you can do that , David ? Yes . I believe I can . May I ask what you hope to achieve by going there ? They created us . Then they tried to kill us . They changed their minds . I deserve to know why . Does it matter why they changed their minds ? Yeah . Yes , it does . I don 't understand . Well ... I guess that 's because I 'm a human being and you 're a fucking robot . Do you mind ? Why ? Oh . Ow . Oh . Uh . Wait a minute . Hold on . Final report of the vessel Prometheus . The ship and her entire crew are gone . If you are receiving this transmission , make no attempt to come to its point of origin . There is only death here now , and I 'm leaving it behind . It is New Year 's Day , the year of our Lord , 2094 . My name is Elizabeth Shaw , last survivor of the Prometheus , and I am still searching . Subtitle created by - Aorion - Hello , Mr. Weyland . I 'm Dr. Elizabeth Shaw . If that name sounds familiar to you it 's because I 've been calling your office every day for the last month trying to get a meeting . I think your people were hoping I 'd give up . I 'm ... I 'm not good at giving up . What I am good at is my job . I 'm an archaeologist . I have doctorates in paleontology , archaeology , human mythology , and memetics . All of which I received from Oxford . I graduated first in my class at the age of 17 . This is not who I am ; it 's simply what I know . I make the distinction , sir , because there 's a difference as what a scientist knows and what they believe . That difference is proof . Do you feel that all the science in the world will never give us the answers we really want ? What happens when we die ? What our purpose is . Where we came from ? Whether or not we 're truly alone . I believe there 's a place where every one of those questions could be answered . I believe I know where that place is . I need you to get me there . Give me ten minutes of your time . Ten minutes to let me show you what I found . And if you put your faith in me , Mr. Weyland , no one would ever feel alone again . If you don 't respond , sir , I completely understand . But ... I 'll be sending this transmission again tomorrow . Thank you What is it about robots that makes them so robotic ? At Weyland industries , it has long been our goal to create artificial intelligence almost indistinguishable from mankind itself . Hello , I am David . What can you do , David ? I can do almost anything that could possibly be asked of me . I can assist your employees . I can make your organization more efficient . I can carry out directives that my human counterparts might find ... distressing or unethical . I can blend in with your workforce effortlessly . David , what do you think about ? I think about anything : children playing , angels , the universe , robots ... David , what makes you sad ? War . Poverty . Cruelty . Unnecessary violence . I understand human emotions although I do not feel them myself . This allows me to be more efficient and capable and makes it easier for my human counterparts to interact with me . Is there anything YOU would like to say , David ? I would like to express gratitude to those who created me . Happy Birthday David , from Weyland Industries . 8th Generation Weyland . Type . Technological . Intellectual . Physical . Emotional . Subtitle created by - Aorion -

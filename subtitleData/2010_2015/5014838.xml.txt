Uh , I 'm gonna go with the latter . You gonna want cheese ? Yes ! Did you text Jesse ? Yeah , he 's with Rat Face . He said he 'd be home eight minutes ago . I 'll call him . And it 's Ratner , not Rat Face . Don 't be cruel . Not being cruel . It 's descriptive . There 's something wrong with that kid . Hey , we got people coming over in five . Get your butt home . An epic game of Modern Warfare . Yeah , that 's what save buttons are for , pal . OK , I 'm coming.Tell Dad to chill . OK . Bye . Dog , this shit is weak , man .

The Fed can prime the pump in DC all it wants , but all it 's gonna do is raise the price for a cup of coffee in California . - Mm-hmm . - Alicia told me he 's back in rehab . I think you have to point the finger at the parents . Do you know they have an open relationship ? Wait . What ? How long have you known this ? - What kind of relationship ? - Eat your food . Tell me everything you know , right now . You 're gonna kill that thing . No , I 'm not . I 'm rehabiting him .

I got two scary words China . India . I 'm terrified . I 'll give you a dollar if you eat that potato salad . - A dollar ? - I just don 't know what you see in him . - You 're so much smarter than he is . Ratner 's smart . He 's so not smart . That stunt he pulled with the car , that 's smart ? His parents forgot about it . Why can 't you ? - Oh . Hello . Why can 't you ? - Oh , come on . Come on . Daniel ... Come on . I just think you should be hanging out with kids your age , that 's all . I 'm old enough . I have my father 's hair . Your father doesn 't have hair . That 's something to look forward to . - Daniel . - Sorry . Daniel , come on . I 've gotta prep these viewings . We need this . " Recovering my courage with an effort , I take a cautious look out . In the middle of the room in front of my father , stands the Sandman , the bright light of the lamp falling full upon his face . " Lunar Base to Command Control . Over . Go for Command Control . Replace ? Why does the Sandman steal people 's eyes ? So he can feed ' em to his children on the moon . Why doesn 't he feed them something else ? Sam , everyone knows eyes taste the best . You think he 'll steal mine ? Maybe , But yours are still pretty small . He 'd probably take mine first . Lunar Base , over and out . You guys gotta keep this door locked tonight , OK ? - I didn 't touch it . - Me neither . What kind of animal eats all the lettuce but leaves the bacon ? A rabbit . A very large rabbit , with opposable thumbs . Maybe it was a mutant lizard who 's mad at Sammy for imprisoning her offspring . No ... Don 't listen to your brother . You want juice ? Ahh ! Gotta go . - Wish me luck . - Luck . I have a second showing at two up on Croft . I should be back before then . Luck . You were laid off from Jacobson ? Uh , yes , sir . The development I was on ran into cash flow issues , and the entire design team was let go . But I was thinking of making a switch anyway , so ... Mortgage LATE NOTICE OF 90 DAY How did it go ? - It went well . - Really ? - When do they get back to you ? - Mm ... next week , most likely . Daniel , that 's great . I 'm proud of you . Lunar Base to Command Control , over . Enough scary stories , Sammy . Say good night to your brother . Mom says I have to say good night . - Night , Mom . - Night , Jess . You , sleep , now . - Night , Mom . - Good night . Oh , Sammy , you scared me . I had a bad dream . Oh , it 's OK . It 's OK now . It 's OK now . Sammy ... ... do you know who did this ? The Sandman . The Sandman ? Is that one of your toys ? He was in my dream . And did he tell you to do this in your dream ? He did it himself , before he came to my room . Well , there 's no sign of forced entry . You sure all the doors and windows were locked ? Yeah , I 'm sure . We check them every night . And other than the food , nothing 's missing ? - No . - No . Nothing . Either the person who did this had a key or , uh , it was someone in the house . Uh ... no , I don 't think so . No , we were all asleep . I 'm not saying it 's anything sinister . People do a lot of strange things when they sleep . Got a call over on Langford once , family kept waking up to a mess in the kitchen every morning . Turns out the teenage daughter was a sleep eater . - A sleep eater ? - Yeah . It 's like a sleep walker , but instead of getting up and walking in their sleep , they actually go to the kitchen and eat . It 's the craziest thing . Look , Officer , this wasn 't a cooking mess . This was like a mathematician 's idea of a geometry joke . I don 't know whether to be pissed or impressed . Well .. maybe you just got some real bright kids on your hands . Yes , We have the system , but we let the service lapse . Trying to cut back a little . - Yes Well , I 'd suggest turning it back on . It 's money well spent . Be safe . Three bedrooms , two bathrooms ... Three bedroom , two bath . It needs a bit of updating , but that 's just a chance to really make it yours . Wait till you see the kitchen . I checked the comps , honey . This is a great buying opportunity . Why don 't you ladies keep going . I 'm gonna catch up . Sure . It 's OK . It 's all right . - Do you need anything ? - No-no-no , I got it . Here is ... Hang on . Here we go . OK , OK . OK . Deep breath . Ready ? Yeah ? All right . Good girl . It gets easier . My oldest , Jesse , was sick all the time when he was little . It was like he was allergic to the entire world . How 'd you get through it ? I worried a lot . Yeah . And he got older and the episodes happened less and less and .. Now , hardly ever a cold . That sounds nice . So what do you think of this place ? Is it a " buying opportunity " ? I know I 'm supposed to be selling you but you can probably do better . I think maybe we should cut back on the cable for a while . I ... Yeah , I don 't ... I don 't think I got it , Lace . Wait a second . I don 't understand . You said it went great . Oh , no , it went OK . It did . But there 's just there 's a lot of competition . So . .. - You lied ? - Come on , Lacy . You did , didn 't you ? Why would you do that , Daniel ? Look , I just do not ... I wanted to not give you bad news . - OK . - For once . - So you lied about it ? - I didn 't lie exactly . I just ... You know , you 've been so stressed lately ... Do not do that ! Do not make this about me . Lunar Base to Command Control . Come in , Command Control . Over . Go for Command Control . Picking up hostile transmission on all frequencies . Over Just ignore them , Sammy . Try to go to sleep . Command Control ? Yes , Lunar Base ? Do you think Dad 's gonna leave ? - No . Why would you say that , Sammy ? Sammy , why would you say that ? 'Cause Tau told me his parents argued every night , then his dad moved to an apartment by the airport , and now he only sees him on the weekends . Don 't worry Sammy , Dad 's not moving anywhere . Now try and go to sleep . Stay with your brother ! Hello ! - This is City One Protection . May I have your name and password , please ? Yes , my ... It 's Daniel Barrett . My password is " Lacy214 . " Thank you , Mr. Barrett . Are you currently experiencing a break-in ? Uh , I don 't think so . I don 't know . We were sleeping , the alarm went off . Uh , it 's not telling me what sensor was tripped . - You there ? - Yes . Yes , Mr. Barrett . We believe this was a false alarm due to a system malfunction . What kind of malfunction ? What sensor was tripped ? - All of them ! - What ? The system is reporting that all eight entry points to the house I don 't understand . How is that possible ? We 're not sure what happened either , but we 'll send someone out tomorrow at 9 : 00 a.m. to check your system . We apologize for the inconvenience . OK . Thank you . They said it was a false alarm . A system malfunction . Daniel , what happened ? Mr. Barrett , have you talked to your children about this ? Yeah ... They both said they were asleep . And you 're sure they 're telling you the truth ? Hey , I 've got kids , too . Right ? I mean , they do stuff like this to get your attention , then they lie about it . Happens all the time . It 's no reflection on you as a parent . I understand how that can happen , but this doesn 't seem like one of those things . My wife doesn 't feel safe in the house right now . Listen , I know this can be tough , but ... is there any reason for either of your children to be angry with you or your wife ? Any ... discord in the family ? Kids have a way of picking up on these things . Excuse me , Mr. Barrett ? I 'm all through here . I couldn 't find anything wrong with the system . So what set it off ? Well , it could be any number of things . It is technical . Bottom line , though , I don 't think anybody actually tried to get in . Look , do either of you have anything that you want to tell us ? Like what ? we know things have been a little strained around here lately . And ... when that happens , that can create feelings towards us that , um ... It 's about the photos , isn 't it ? Yes , it is . Did either of you take them ? We were sleeping . How could we take them ? Sammy ? Sam , did you have that dream again ? About the Sandman ? What dream ? Samuel .. did the Sandman take the photos ? It 's OK . You can tell us . I can 't . What 's going on , Lace ? why not ? He told me not to say . Daniel , stop . I don 't care about the photos right now . Daniel , we will talk about it ? Now you want to talk ? When were you gonna tell me he was having these dreams ? I didn 't think it was a big deal . - Kids have nightmares . Yeah . They don 't act them out , though . - Obviously I was wrong . Not funny , Sammy . Just tell them where the photos are . But I don 't know where they are . I did not take them . The Sandman isn 't real . You do understand that , right ? Daniel , stop ! What are we gonna do about this ? I don 't know , Lace . What do you want to do ? Want to put him in therapy ? How we gonna pay for that ? He 's our son , not a cable bill . I know , Lacy . Karen says she knows someone who talked to Shelly when she was going through some stuff . I guess she works on a sliding scale , so ... Did you tell them we were having money trouble ? Daniel , stop ! Let 's just wait a few days , all right ? What do you keep scratching at ? Nothing . It 's , like , a bite or something . There they are . Go get ' em . Hey , this he is . Bobby , get up ! Get up . You 're not hurt . There you go ! Now get the ball ! Hey , so Karen says you guys are , what , looking for a therapist for Sammy ? No . .. It 's a rough spot . Is everything all right at home ? - Yes - Ew ! He peed himself ! Sammy ! Sammy ! Hey , buddy , if you had to go to the bathroom , you should 've just told me . Sammy , what 's wrong ? Sammy , what 's wrong ? Sammy . No . .. Alright . Hey , hey , hey , hey ! Sammy , stop ! Sammy ! But you 're sure he 's OK now ? OK , just get home . I 'm here . Oh , shit ... They just hit the house , hundreds of them . Karen , I can 't even begin to describe it . Yeah . No , there 's ... We got an army of people over here right now . They could be contaminated . We 're just looking at them . OK , but just , both of you , don 't touch them . yes ! Dude , this is awesome ! This is clearly a early infectious outbreak . This is definitely the start of an outbreak . - Bitch , you 're gonna get quarantined ! - Shut up . If I am , so are you.We 'll run autopsies on a sample , see if they 're sick . We haven 't had any reports of avian flu in the local starling population , but it could be something new . Well , and if they weren 't sick ? Then we 'll look for environmental causes.hail storms , lightning . We 're coming up on the Fourth , so you can 't discount fireworks . They 'll disorient a flock pretty easily . Look , uh , it 'd be great if we get some answers to what caused this . We 've been having some uh , strange things going on around here , and it would just be really nice if this wasn 't adding to it . Uh , we 'll do our best , Mr. Barrett . - I 'll give you a call . - Okay , thank you . Sam , Dad said you got scared in the park today ? You don 't remember screaming at the park , buddy ? What do you remember ? I remember going in the grass to play with the other kids . - Yes .. Then I wasn 't me anymore . Hey , uh , Sam , why don 't you head up and , uh , brush your teeth , and I 'll tuck you in , OK ? Thanks , pal . OK . OK . We 'll call the therapist in the morning . - What 's going on ? ! - There was someone ... - I ... I just turned on the light . - What ? - There was someone in the room . - What did you see ? The light , and there was someone ... Sam ? ! Sam ! What happened ? - Sam ! - What 's going on ? - Sam ! - Sammy ! - Sam ! Sam ? Sam ! What are you doing ? Sam ? Sam ? Sam ! okay . Sam ! Wake up . Why are we outside ? They don 't know how he got out without setting off the alarm . They 're gonna send someone to check the system again in the morning . Daniel ... I saw someone in Sam 's room . The window was locked , Lacy . You were standing by the door . If somebody was there , where 'd he go ? I don 't know . I can 't explain it . But I saw someone standing over Sam 's bed . And when I turned on the lights , both of them were gone . You didn 't see Sammy in his room . So you think I imagined it ? Lacy , what is this ? What are we talking about ? I do not know ... I just say that something is happening . This is me now . It 's not Sam . Look , I hear you.l do . But we 've got enough to handle right now without getting crazy . It 's not gonna help anything . What the fuck ? Listen , you can 't tell your mom about this place . What , you think I 'm gonna get you in trouble ? - Promises ? - What are you gonna do to me ? You 've ... been a bad girl . What are you doing ? Stop it ! Dude , what is wrong with you ? Sorry .. Have you ever even kissed a girl before ? Come here . Pucker your lips . Close your eyes . If someone 's coming into this house , We 'll see him with this . This isn 't some kind of twisted way for you to spice up our sex life , is it ? That wasn 't the idea . But I like the way you think . This is gonna solve it , Lace . Do you think he 's watching us ? You mean Dad ? Yes . Probably . Do you think there 's somebody here ? No . Then why did Dad put up the cameras ? 'Cause he 's just making sure . - Command Control ? - Yes , Lunar Base ? I 'm scared . Don 't worry , Sammy . I won 't let anything happen to you . I promise So , three bedroom , two bath . It needs a bit of updating , but that 's really a chance to make it your own , get exactly what you want . What do you think , darling ? It looks like a lot of work . I have to say , you know , I know this area pretty well now , and you 're not gonna do much better for this price . They are highly motivated . I mean , I think we can be very . Are you okay ? Lacy ? Lacy ! ' Oh ' my God ! What the hell happened to you ? I 've been calling for hours . I got a message from a very distressed client saying you had some kind of a breakdown in the middle of the walk-through this morning . They were about to call 911 for Christ 's sakes , but you walked out of the house . - Oh , my God . Look , I know it 's been rough out there , but maybe you should take a break for a little while . No , Pete , I can 't do that . OK , well , the thing is I 'm not asking , Lacy . Your clients took their business over to Sunshine Realty . I 'm sorry , kiddo . Just call me when you 're feeling better . - Pete , please let me explain , OK ? - Mrs. Barrett ? This is Janice Rhodes from the National Wildlife Center . I got your husband 's voice mail , so I thought I 'd try you . Oh , I 'm sorry . Yes , go ahead . I have some new information about the incident , but I 'm afraid it raises more questions than it answers . Oh , w-what kind of questions ? The birds were negative for avian flu . But what we did determine is that the impact trajectories indicate the birds were part of three different flocks and not one , as we originally assumed . I don 't understand . So what does that mean ? What it means is that three different migrations coming from three different directions flew into your house , Mrs. Barrett . It 's as if something was drawing them to your home . " mass death of birds " " Officers investigating the mass deaths of birds unusual in many countries " " World Phenomenon Death follows the order ... " " perturbation " geometric " Conspiracy Theory " " You are being visited ? " " Signs you 've Voted " Have you been working on anything since leaving Jacobson ? You know , I 've been tinkering with a few personal projects , but pretty much enjoying just being a stay-at-home dad . Oh , really ? Oh , man , what I wouldn 't give for a little time like that with my family . Yeah . No , it 's ... it 's been great . You guys got big plans for the Fourth , or ... ? My kids got me running all over town looking for fireworks . No , I think we 'll probably stick close to home . Well , listen , Daniel , I 'm really glad you came in . I loved what you did on the Bay Cities project . - Thank you . - All the other partners are very supportive , so I say we do it . - Really ? - Really . What do you say ? - I ... Yes ! - It 's yours . All right ? - Fantastic . - Absolutely . I 'll be in touch , OK ? - Great . Thank you very much . Hello ? Hey . I 've got news . - Me , too . - I got it , Lace . I got the job . Are you serious , Daniel ? They want me to start on the 15th . Daniel , that 's ... that 's amazing ! Let 's see if Karen and Mike will take Sammy tonight . Jesse can stay at the Ratners ' . We need to celebrate , for a change . Oh , shit , I 'm sorry . What was your news ? Uh ... nothing . Let 's celebrate . Daniel ? Daniel ? Why aren 't you answering me ? Daniel , wake up ! Daniel , wake up , wake up ! What am I doing in the kitchen ? I found you in the backyard . You don 't remember getting out of bed ? No . It 's very ... weird . It 's more than weird . I 'm ready to tell you my news . I lost six hours today . I mean , the last thing I remember , I was in the middle of this walk-through . The clients told Pete that they thought I was having some kind of breakdown . And I woke up in bed , and I had this . and with it . Jesus , Lacy ! Daniel , I have to show you something . So I started with the birds . and ... the best they can understand it is that something is interfering with the Earth 's geomagnetic field , and ... and that 's causing the birds to veer off course . Some people say that it has something to do with the government , that they 're testing some kind of super-secret weapons technology . And other people think it 's something else , something ... not from here . What does that mean , " not from here " ? What does that mean , " not from here " ? Not from ... this planet . Lacy ... I 've been research ... - No , it 's more than hard to believe . I want to believe , I mean ... I mean ... aliens ? That 's ... That 's insane . Right ? You know this is the reason we don 't self-diagnose on the Internet . Stop . Hear me out on this . There are people who have reported experiencing the same things that we have been experiencing , in these communities where these other bird deaths have taken place . This picture was drawn by a five-year-old in Chesapeake Bay in 2007 , shortly before he vanished . Vanished , Daniel . His family claims he was taken by aliens and that they had been entering their home for weeks . Sam drew this yesterday . Yeah , well , maybe Sammy saw this drawing online and copied it . And maybe he made 800 birds hit our house ? I found a guy in the city who claims to be an expert on this stuff . - I think we gotta go talk to him . - Not ! - Yes ! - No . No , no , no , no . Well , what other explanation do you have ? Just because I can 't explain something , doesn 't mean aliens are responsible . Why can 't you understand that some things defy normal explanations ? We 're not those people who believe in crazy things ! Maybe those people aren 't the crazy ones ! - Where is my wife ? - Don 't do that ! Stop it ! I 'm not saying nothing is going on . Crazy stuff is happening right now ! Stranger things have happened ... But this , this is ... this is too much . There 's got to be another answer . Hey , shirt off , string bean . Can 't swim with your clothes on . Come on , dork , I know you want to swim . Sammy , come here . Let me take a look at you . Sammy , come here ! It 's OK , baby . I 'm just gonna take a look , OK ? Put your arms up . Sammy , tell me who did this to you . Sammy , I need you to tell me who did this to you . Hey , you know that girl Jennifer ? - Yes - That bitch was on my jock . - Really ? - Yes What about you ? You get any ? I saw you with Shelly . Did you kiss her ? - Yes . - Did you feel her titties ? Kind of , I guess . Shit , dawg ! That 's nothing ! You got to go downtown . That 's what I do with all my ladies . Hey , Barret ! Dude , stop ! - Better run , bitch ! Stop being a dick ! Stop ! I 'm gonna pop a cap in tour ass ! Man down ! Oh , come on , it didn 't hurt that bad , you pussy . Jesse ? Jesse ! How is he ? Well , I didn 't find anything physically wrong with Jesse that would cause a blackout or seizure . And the MRI was clear . So , as I said , I don 't think what we 're dealing with here is a neurological problem . So what do you think it is ? I believe this is a symptom emotional trauma . Now , I want you to listen caution , Mr and Mrs Barrett . During the inspection I found unusual body marks on children generally . Excuse me , sign what ? Looks small geometric shapes . boxes , rectangles , circle ... problematic part is that ... This seems like printed with a branding iron . Now , Mr and Mrs Barrett , This my opinion , he did not do it alone . Jesse said he did not know could be like that . you do not know how he got it ? no ... Well , I must tell you that because of their age , need in-depth investigation to Child Protective Services . This is standard procedure . must answer some questions . Understand what I 'm saying ? yes . Mr Barrett , report says Jesse playing in the woods ... With her in at night . Yes , boys Ratner called Kevin . few years older than Jesse . is there any reason to believe that she got into something strange ? - Dad , what are you doing ? - Daniel , stop ! - Daniel , stop ! - Hey , Mr. Barrett ... - Jesse , how are you ? - What did you do to my son ? - What are you doing , huh ? - No ! - Daniel , stop ! - He 's only 14 ! Stop it ! Ask your child what he did ! What 's wrong with you ? Jesse ! Do not bother me . Hey . Do not touch me ! contact Service Tomorrow Child Protection . my friend asked me like a criminal . Lacy ... Karen said that Sammy says sand man to do it ... you realize that he thinks Sand is human , right ? - I know . - Did you do this ? You hear that shit ? - Jesus Christ ! - - Did you put your hands on our son ? ! Then tell me who did it ! Tell me . Because it 's not just happening in their heads ! I do not know ! But when I find out , I 'm gonna deal with it . Yeah , you really dealt with things today , all right . What happens in the pool ? What happened in the woods ? Ratner told that your father being a psychopath . up , Sammy ! Sammy , wake up ! What 's wrong , Daddy ? What is it ? Do you remember right after Jesse was born , and he was so sick ? The doctors didn 't know what it was , and they told us all we could do was wait until morning To see if he would be okay ? Tonight is the longest of my life . I feel ... helpless . It took me most of the night , I do not know who 's kissing young children at 01 : 00 am . but I finally realized something that allowed me to watch the sun come up without fear . However it all turned out , no matter what I had to face I knew I would get through it , because I had you . I 'm ready to believe . Mr. Pollard ? Yes . I 'm sorry . I had to run to the store . - Okay . Um , I 'm Lacy , and this is my husband , Daniel . You said on the phone had two children . Yes , I am ... We were just thinking that it was better maybe if we met you first , and then ... Thank you . - Have a seat in the living room . I 'll , uh , put on some tea . I think he has a cat . Cats do not care about them . I used to live in the suburbs , but the dogs always barked at night when they came around . Dogs have a sense for them . Kept me up at night , so , uh so I moved here to a building that doesn 't allow dogs . Helps me sleep a little better at night . I don 't fight them anymore . Them ? The Grays ... That 's what they 're called . There are three generally accepted kinds of aliens : the Grays , lnsectoids and the Reptilians . But nine times out of ten , what people report seeing are the Grays . In fact , I 'm ... I 'm dubious about the other two altogether . Especially the Reptilians . I don 't think those accounts are credible . Yeah . That would make anyone skeptical . sorry . The ... the first thing we need to do is determine whether or not you actually are experiencing an encounter . This ... is the test ? Helps weed out the lunatics . To see if anyone was crazy . well . Let 's do it . Have either of you seen any bright lights in the sky above your neighborhood that moved in an unusual way ? - Not Have you experienced any severe headaches or migraines ? No . Either of you heard a ringing in your ears that seems to be happening only inside your head ? Yes . Prolonged Illness , strange allergic ... Or nosebleeds ? - Yes - Yes .. Have you witnessed any abnormal behavior by animals in your neighborhood ? Three different flocks of birds flew into our house the other day . I would say that qualifies . stretches of time that you can 't account for ? ont And have you experienced a feeling that you might not be in control of your own body ? How do you know all this ? You are not alone in this ... Others have experienced what you 're going through and have struggled the way you 're struggling now . why Grays , whoever they may be , so interested in us ? What makes us so special ? Nothing . There 's nothing special about you . I 'm sorry . You were hoping for a different answer . But this is beyond our comprehension . What answer would a lab rat understand from a scientist in a white coat putting electrodes in its brain , giving it cancer ? I 've interviewed literally thousands of people who claim to have been visited by the Grays . They come from all walks of life . The only thing they have in common ... is that their lives have become a living hell because of it . People think of aliens as these beings invading our planet in some great cataclysm , destroying monuments , stealing our natural resources . But it 's not like that at all . Invasion ... already happened . No one knows exactly when ... But ... Here They were here . The presence of the Grays is now a fact of life . Like death and taxes . do you know what they want ? seems to be ... Learning , I guess . Experimenting with us . One thing we know for sure is , they use our fears against us . can get ... . It can start like a ... a childish prank .. a mess in the kitchen or things missing in the house . And before you know it , you 're walking through a full-blown nightmare . You probably already have implants . Implants ? That 's how they control you . Make you do things you can 't remember , make you see things that aren 't there . Shall we have a look ? He has ... Let me see . This one didn 't take as well . Skin 's pretty irritated , that happens sometimes . It 's a ... it 's a rash or a bite . That 's what they want you to think . The Grays hide what they do . Disguise the implants as something perfectly normal . Most people don 't even know they have them . We can not remove it ? No . No . Believe me , I 've tried . Oh my God ! Every time I think I 'm getting it , it seems to burrow in deeper . That deeper . We 'll move . Pack everything in the car and just drive away . These beings almost certainly came millions of light-years to get here . Do you really think moving to the next town or checking into a motel will stop them from finding you ? The events you 've been experiencing , the disturbances in your home , the blackouts , the marks on your bodies they are not the beginning of something , Daniel . They are the end of something . It 's like a countdown The Grays will watch a family for a long time before they reveal themselves . But once they do , it means they 're getting ready to take someone .. What are you talking about ? This is important . Which member of your family did the Grays first make contact with ? my youngest son , Sam . Then Sam is in the most danger . The Grays almost always abduct the first family member they showed an interest in . So that 's it ? - We just wait until they take our son ? No . You fight them with everything you 've got . Your only hope is to make it so difficult for them , that they simply move on to someone else . Wait-wait-wait-wait , I 'm sor ... That can work ? It has before , in some cases . Yes . I 've even heard of cases where someone who 's been taken has eventually returned , but you can 't count on it . Everything the Grays do is intended to divide us from one another , to isolate the one they 've chosen . Your greatest defense against them is if your family is unified . But you have to act quickly . There isn 't much time . Protect your family , Mr. Barrett . We 'll go to the police . We 'll show them the surveillance video . And say what , " We think aliens have come into our house , implanted some probes we can 't see " ? The police will think we 're crazy , Lace . - Hell , I think we 're crazy . - It 's the truth ! - You realize what will happen if we do that ? They won 't just not believe us . And they will take Jesse and Sam . They 'll say we 're unfit to be parents . Everybody 's already suspicious . We have to do something . You heard what he said ! This only goes one way ! I mean , you 've got your Remington .17 , uh , your Ruger .204 ... then there 's a Winchester .243 A-Bolt , if you 're looking to go with a higher caliber . Uh ... I need something that packs a lot of punch at close range . What kind of hunting you say you 're doing ? Mom , what 's going on ? Why are we getting a dog ? I thought Dad was allergic . Dad can take medicine , and dogs are good to have around the house . - It 's for protection , isn 't it ? - We 'll talk about it later . - I want to talk about it now . - What about this one ? Yes . Hey , man . - You 're boarding up the windows ? We 're keeping out the Sandman . - Where 's the dog ? - In a room in back with Mom . We got a dog ? You want to give me a hand ?

 In the mid 1950s , in the midst of post-war chaos , organized crime units known as " kumi " sprung up through out Japan . They became the yakuza . The yakuza underworld is ruled by chivalry and loyalty . This is known as " jingi . " If a yakuza violates the " jingi " there is hell to pay , for the yakuza live and die by this principle . You only get hit when you 're afraid of getting hit . I can scare landmines with a glare ! It 's time to settle the score ! Kill me if you can !

No wonder they call you Mad Dog . Right , Shozo lwaki ? Who the hell are you ? We 're government agents from Japan . We brought news about your father . Six months ago , your father , head of the Iwaki Family , was attacked as he left a Western Japan Yakuza council meeting . He took 88 bullets to his body but was still able to kill his assailant . Right before his heart stopped beating he screamed out your name . Shozo ! What a sad story , that old fart ! You good for nothing fool ! Who do you think you are ? Time has left you and your old ways behind . Let me take over . Then you can go trim your bonsai ! You arrogant bastard , you deserve this ! That 's fine by me . Take a piece of me ! The next time you show your face , it will be kill or be killed ! Damn right ! The cords are snapping ... ! Shit , I split my ass in half ! Japan ! I 'm finally back ! The smog smells so sweet ! It 's been four years . The brothers will be happy to see you back . Why is it Rising Sun Loans now ? Rising Sun Loans for your brighter spending life ! Come right in ! This way please , gentlemen . Welcome to Rising Sun Loans . We 're not here for a loan . If I 'm not mistaken , wasn 't this the Iwaki Family 's headquarters ? Are you with the Iwaki Family ? Oh , no , no ! It 's just that some time ago , we had a little business with the Iwaki Family . Look at yourselves . What are you wearing ? Yakuza nowadays don 't dress so obvious ! They are dressed to kill in suits ! Anyhow , whatever became of the Iwaki Family ... ? When the boss died , the family fell apart . We 're the Shimada Family of the Kurawaki-kumi . Kurawaki and Shimada ... ? They were the boss 's junior officers ! " Mr. Kurawaki is the ruler of Japan 's underworld now ! " Now beat it . Who 's behind this ... ? Stop babbling ! Did you know that Boss lwaki had a good-looking son ? Who ? Be quiet ! What 's all that noise ? You broke my concentration so I couldn 't take a shit . They are lwaki 's associates . He 's talking about lwaki 's son . Iwaki 's son ... he must be talking about Shozo . What an idiot ! He was born without a lot of brain cells . He was very thoughtless and reckless . He yelled an anyone who crossed his path . He was animal , but in front of me , he was a kitten ! You 're the man ! I was kind of crazy in my youth ... You go , you go ! Die , fuckers ! Shozo ! Shimada , so you 're the boss now ? I 'm not the man you used to know . Let 's go ! That 's fine by me . You have more hair on your head ! Shut your mouth ! Motherfuckers ! I 'd appreciate a little more enthusiasm . After all , I , Kurawaki , wouldn 't be here today if it wasn 't for all the yakuza bosses in Japan . We have looked after you since you were a baby ! And this is how you repay us ? After all that we 've done for you ? Let me make myself clear . I 'm merely trying to save you from yourselves . And yet you choose to reject my offer . The days of guns and knives are long over . Today it 's all about business . You 're talking about the yakuza ! Let me repeat the situation . You want all the families united under your name . But none of us in the East or West will agree to that . If you want to take us on , then be ready to fight . I heard rumors that you framed Boss lwaki . And you don 't have a fragment of chivalry or loyalty . We have ways of dealing with men like you . " Oh , jingi , is it ? There 's no place for emotions in business . That 's my principle . We 're wasting time . Let 's go . You 're all too weak to do anything . You need to face reality ! Shozo , wait a minute , please ! Shimada . I know you don 't have the guts to pull off these schemes , Caddie , what have we got ? A par-two hole , no flagstick . I was just told to manage this loan operation ! No wind . Nice shot ! The first shot was all right . Listen , Shozo ! I didn 't kill your old man ! So was it the other guy who killed him ? Nayoko . I used to be so infatuated with you ! When you were a schoolgirl , I would jack off to thoughts of you ! Kurawaki , your slime ... But your parents arranged a marriage for you . I was too low in the yakuza ranks to even talk to you . He will return to me . Don 't you find me more suitable now ? I 'd rather marry a mitochondrion than you . She sure is something . Was she talking about that knucklehead ? Yes , but he 's out of the picture . He 's probably dead on the other side of the Earth , covered in crap . He deserves it . Speaking . Kurawaki , how have you been ? Want to play a round of golf ? It 's the knucklehead , Shozo ! I 'm about to nail a hole in one . Listen , it 'll be loud ! Boss . Boss , help me ! Shimada . Swing to the rhythm ! Nice shot . " Shimada 's form is so bad it affecting my game . " I want to play with you . You 're a fly buzzing around shit . I like your spirit . " l hope it won 't come back at you . " We 're all players now . Junior . Where 's Kurawaki hiding ? Look at that . Has that tall building always been there ... ? He 's probably up there , looking down at us . I 'll drag him down after I have a little more fun . Ouch ! Damn it ! Shozo ! Nayoko ? How dare you come back , looking so innocent ? You better run , fuckers ! Shozo ! Nayoko , wait a minute ! Oh , I missed you ! Shozo . When you left Japan four years ago you wrote me a letter . And you wrote ... " Supersaver , 20 % OFF ! " Shozo , I 'll get you for this ! " I 'll marry you when I get back . " Junior , it 's all clear . Okay , let 's go in . This is a respectable coffee shop . We do not serve pasta carbonara . Die , punk ! Then maybe I 'll serve you ! You haven 't changed a bit . Junior , good to see you in one piece . The usual , please . I have spaghetti covered in ketchup ! And a melon soda float . Our specialty . That 's the way I like it . You wasted no time making trouble . Kurawaki 's men are looking for you everywhere . That jackass ! I 'll send him back to hell and beyond . Rumor has it that Kurawaki has gained a lot of power since he 's got backing from a foreign organization . He wants to unite the Western and Eastern affiliates He wants to rule all of Japan . Not bad for a jackass . His foreign connection wants to market a drug here that 's 100 times stronger than heroine . They call it the hyper drug . Kurawaki is such a lowlife ... He agreed to stay away from heroine like my father had told us to ! That 's fine by me ! He 'll learn what it means to have me as an enemy ! Damn , that 's cold ! Junior ! I 'll get you some napkins . Nobody has ever lasted this long against me . I thought you were just the Boss 's baby boy . You 're a tough one alright . The fight 's not finished . Not until your heart stops beating . Anyone who picks on me , gets it back 500-fold . That 's my principle ! I 'll take you to the bottom of hell ! Stop ! Enough , boys ! Don 't tell me what to do ! Damn , your father fights like the devil ... Wait until he retires in a few years . His ass is mine ! I like the way you talk tough . You 're not so bad yourself . He tied us too close together . You smell like sweat ! You smell ! Shozo , you 're Thunder God and I 'm Storm God . Whenever we meet we fight to death , but we both live on the same cloud . Damn right ! We should become brothers for life . How do we do that ? I 'll show you how . You or I ... who will rule the world first ? It 's a competition . I already know you 'll lose ! Quiet ! Shut the hell up ! What 's Tetsu up to nowadays ? He was put in jail for his family 's crimes . But nobody 's heard anything since . That 's just like Tetsu ... Takuzo , Santaro , let 's go ! Yes , sir ! What are you going to do , Junior ? Bugs like to fly into light , right ? So , I 'm going to set off some fireworks . 1 potato , 2 potato ... It 's beautiful . I let him have too much fun . That retarded animal could use some discipline . Here it goes ! Damn you ! The next time I see Shozo , I 'll have him buried ! Sister Nayoko , I know it 's none of my business but ... The harder you try to catch a man , the more he runs . Particularly a man like him . He 's my weakness ... It 's on the house . Who 's there ? I served five years in jail for the family and this is how I get thanked ! Sumire ! Hello , Tetsu . Tetsu , brother ... Tetsu . Don 't get me wrong . I 'm not doing this because I like it . Your sister told me she would do anything to protect you , Tetsu . That 's what she said . So I have to test how deep her love is for you . How deep it can go , you know ? You 're going to hell . I 'll need some company then . What happened to you ? Sorry , Junior ... They took Nayoko ... Kurawaki , that sneaky motherfucker ! What 's this ... ? What 's going on ? Round-rimmed glasses and long pigtails ... This is how you looked seven years ago . Remember ? Hey ! Put this on . Stop it ! I learned one thing from that knucklehead . If you want something , get it any way you can ! Your limp dick would sting as much as a mosquito bite ! You 're irresistible . What was that ? Kurawaki ! Come out ! Shozo ! You sneaky bastard ! A true yakuza fights fair ! My security should be impenetrable ... Unbelievable ... Kurawaki . Come on down ! A small-time bad guy like you can 't afford to sit back and watch . You 're going to get it now ! Big brother ... You come up ! That is , if you can . You 'll be my 276th victim ! I 'll rip all of you apart ! I have our toughest guys guarding each floor . Nobody can beat them all , not even you . Are you done with your speech ? You went to a lot of trouble ! They 're all trained to kill . You 're no match for them . Takuzo ! Yes , sir ! What the ... ? I 'm not going up there to you ! You 're coming down to me ! He wouldn 't ... ! 1 , 2 , 3 ! Shozo , you crazy bastard ! Ouch ... What 's this ? What 's going on ? Look ! Hey , Kurawaki . Shozo ... I know you 're up there . Iit seemed like a lot of trouble , so I took a short cut . Hey , you 're here too ! Don 't play dumb , you brain-dead moron ! Shit , what 's with the costume ? You almost blew me up , moron ! You 're so loud ... Here I come . Let 's settle the score . Give me some kejime ! You 're mistaken . I haven 't done anything bad . I heard that you framed my father . Not me ! Let me refresh your memory . Junior ! Bastard ! Come back , untie me ! Sorry . It doesn 't hurt a bit ! Maybe he 's not human ... Shoot me again ! It 'll be a yakuza 's medal of honor ! He 's a complete moron . Checkmate ! It 's all willpower ! No ... ! Adios , amigo ! Shozo ! Junior . Junior , why ... ? How could you leave us like that ! He was a moron to the end . What did you say ? Who are you calling a moron ! Junior ! You 're alive . Of course I 'm alive ! Junior ! Your leg ! Do you ever die ? Kurawaki , that bastard ! Takuzo , give me a pack . Kurawaki , if you want this brawl to end , you better kill me . Away it goes ! Stop right there . I know you ! We said we were Japanese agents . But there 's more . I 'm the Prime Minister 's special agent , Torahiko Akao . Also known as Red Tiger . Shozo lwaki , you 're in our custody as of right now . If you think a guy ike you can arrest Shozo lwaki ... You bitch , what the ... Shozo ! Junior ! You assholes ! Shozo ! Where am I ... ? Shozo , I 'm turning you into the toughest yakuza ever . I 'm already the toughest yakuza ever ... " New Kurawaki Building , Under Construction " Big brother is right . It is a good plan . Tatsuyuki ... What is it that I have and Shozo doesn 't ? That 's true . I have you , my dependable ally . But I have something far superior to him . And that is ... That 's right . " Tetsu Okamura Escapes ! " A brain . " Tetsu Okamura Escapes ! " Dinner time ! Stay ! Okay , go ahead ! Brother Tetsu , this is it . Thank you for everything ! Yasu . I heard that you 're leaving me for the Iwaki Family . Give them my regards , will you ? You said you would quit . You said you would quit , brother ! Don 't do this to yourself ! Tell me something , Sumire . Will I ever get ahead of Shozo ? Will I ? My body is killing me ... Sumire . It 's too much ... Sumire . I think I 'm going with you ... Take this . And the pain will go away . What 's this ? It will help you ... surpass him . Surpass him ... ! " Keep Out " What 's taking them so long ? What in the hell are they doing in there ? He said , " Leave it to us . " Which we did , but all this waiting is driving me crazy ! Sister ! Are you okay ? How 's Shozo ? Don 't worry . He 's in the hands of the best surgeons and scientists . Who are you people anyway ? Didn 't Red Tiger tell you ? The Prime Minister 's special agents . I don 't understand politics ! Nobody knows our agency exits . We 're only deployed when there 's a threat to Japan . We work for the Prime Minister and we are sworn to secrecy . We 're licensed to kill , if needed . It sounds like bullshit to me . What 's this place anyway ? If your agency is so important , this place would look impressive , like an embassy . You can 't fool us . Like I said , we are secret agents . This is an abandoned spa resort . A perfect hideout for our operation . Cut the bullshit . What do special agents want with guys like us ? It 's the Death Drop Mafia . Kurawaki has been on a meteoric rise lately . He 's so powerful that he 's able to mobilize military forces . We need support from somewhere . Is the Death Drop Mafia behind Kurawaki ? I 'm sure you 've heard of them . The world 's largest crime organization that practically owns the US Forces . The United Yakuza lnternational ! What 's wrong ? This is Black Dahlia . Zodiac is on Red Tiger . We 're on lwaki 's son . After we complete the mission , blow up this place , copy ? In here . He 's not awake yet . He 's out on a high dose of anesthesia . It would kill any normal person . The Boss is wise to strike now . Kurawaki can 't handle him . Once he 's awake , there 's no stopping him . What are you doing , you ... ! The anesthesia isn 't working ! You 're finished , Shozo ! Sounds like he 's awake . Hey , it 's time you explain to us what 's going on ! Ouch ! God damn it ! Get him ! Now ! Ouch ! This hurts like hell ! Shozo is no longer what he was . The best of Japan is invested in him ! He 's the yakuza weapon ! Yakuza ... weapon ? What the hell is this ? Ouch ! Ouch , ouch , ouch ... ! Shozo ! After going through the bionic operation ... it must hurt like hell . We needed something to take on the Death Drop Mafia 's latest weapons . Ouch ! We applied Japan 's human-weapon technology . It hurts ... Damn ! I 'll mince them ! The M61 Vulcan on the right arm will shred any human . And installed on the left knee is ... Fight like a man , a fist fight ! ... an anti-tank rocket launcher . Ouch ! I can 't take this ! That hurts more than the arm ! Who asked you to do that to him ? You did whatever you wanted to him ... You should thank us ! He would have been permanently crippled ! The best of Japan went into his body ! Shozo . You bastard , what did you do to me ? Fire if you like . Just know this . Japan 's future depends on you ! Shozo , blow him to pieces ! He used you like a lab rat ! Junior ! I know ! Be cool , Shozo . Thank you , Red Tiger . This new body kicks ass ! I love it ! Are you crazy ? Junior , your brain is damaged ... Sure I was surprised when I first saw it . But this body makes me invincible . The toughest yakuza in history ! Watch out ! Are you sure he 's the right man ? I never make wrong choices . Prepare for the next attack . Shozo . Are you going to do what they tell you to do ? I 'd better . Look at me now . Look at me , don 't I look good ? You don 't need this to ... Sure , I don 't need this to be the toughest yakuza ! But I work for the Japanese government now . I 'm a government certified yakuza ! The toughest in history ! Your father wanted you to be head of the Iwaki Family , and ... Shozo , decide . It 's now or never . I 'm talking about what our parents decided for us ... You know ? About us ... Our engagement ? It 's something our parents decided . We were young and naive . Neither one of our paretns are alive anymore . You shouldn 't be tied to the past . Shozo ! Ouch ... Stop acting up ! Behave ! Nayoko ? Are you okay , Nayoko ? Of course I 'm not okay , you scumbag ! Sorry , I can 't operate this thing very well yet . You want to kill me ? Come on , I 'll take you on ! Shut up , you ugly dog ! You 're worrying me . Kurawaki 's men could still be around . Mind your own business ! I 'd would rather a flesh-eating bacteria in the sewer worry about me ! Die , you idiot ! Same to you , scum ! Fine by me , you no-good bitch ! Junior , where 's Nayoko ? How would I know ? Ouch ! Moron ! Death Drop Mafia is on the move . Die , suckers ! Damn ! I need to give it a rest ! Wake up ! Ouch , I just can 't get used to this thing ! Damn , it hurts . They are really making me work hard . Junior . You don 't know when to stop ! They 're not the big fish ! Where has Kurawaki gone ? What 's that smell ? It 's gas ! Gas does not scare a true yakuza ! Motherfuckers ! Your asses are mine ! Takuzo , I want something powerful ! Something devastating ! How about this ? Perfect ! Death to those fuckers ! Blow to pieces , you bastards ! This is it ! No summer ends without fireworks ! You ! Come on . I didn 't want to look like this either , right big brother ? Kurawaki ? Nayoko . I 've always wanted you . But you never ... ever ... gave a damn about me . Not a bit ... Things have changed now . I own you now . Finally you 're mine . Sorry to disappoint you but if you thought you 'd be more appealing as a heap of junk ... you 're wrong ! Don 't be rude ! Never mind that , Tatsuyuki . Nayoko , you 're so desirable . That knucklehead ... You think you have a chance against Shozo ? He 's not the Shozo you remembered . Give up before he comes to get you . We have an ace in the hole . Shozo , this time ... I 'll finish you off . Is that all you 've got ? I haven 't had enough ... Where 's that bastard Kurawaki ? In the parking lot . I have a life reading there . Let 's get him . Don 't kill him . I want him alive . He has information . Sorry , but I 'm going to shred him ! Shozo , listen . I 'd would be stupid if I let you do as you please . I can shut you down by pressing this red button . Now do as I say ! Nobody shuts me down now . Shozo , don 't ! I 'm coming to get you , Kurawaki ! She 's naked ! I 'll take her on . You guys wait here . Hey , girl , I 'll kick your ass ! But first put some clothes on . You 're so exposed ... What would your parents say ? Here , go buy something to wear . Then we 'll rock ' n roll . Have we met before ? Come here . What in the hell ? Junior , are you okay ? Kurawaki 's assassins aren 't bad ! Eat my bullets ! They 're gone ! Junior , they 're total bad-asses . Stay focused ! I know ! Junior ! Stay back ! Eat this ! Not bad at all . Tetsu ... ? Junior ! Leave us ! This is between me and him . Tetsu ! Tetsu ! It 's you , isn 't it ? Shozo . Tetsu . It 's me , Shozo . What 's wrong with you ? Hey , Sumire ... I 'm going to beat Shozo this time for sure . Shozo ! Die ! Son of a bitch ! Get the killer ammo ! What do you want ? Junior , there 's nothing these bullets won 't penetrate ! Yeah ! Not again ... They take everything away from me ... Stay back ! Tetsu ! Tetsu . Guys like us ... should be fighting with our fists . Nobody 's lasted this long against me . Shozo . Shozo , you 're Thunder God and I 'm Storm God . Whenever we meet we fight to death . But we both live on the same cloud . Damn right ! Tetsu , do you remember ? We would beat the shit out of each other everytime we met ... Tetsu , you 've done enough . Son of a bitch ... " Big Boss lwaki rests here " Big brother , it 's ready ! How long has it been , Big Boss ? I never thought I would see you again . Shozo ! Big Boss ! Kurawaki . You traitor ! You bastards . The yakuza 's way is the way of guns and knives . And chivalry and loyalty are the order . But you 've gone the wrong way . I don 't need the Death Drop Mafia to help me conquer Japan ! I have this ! I have the weapon to end all weapons ! The only thing that can fight the yakuza weapon and win ! A nuclear warhead ! You just sound desperate to me . Look at this marvelous weapon ! The warhead is embedded in the man who once ruled half of Japan ! You know what this means ? He 's the new threat of nuclear fallout to the nation ! Way to go ! He 's the Atomic Yakuza ! Kurawaki . Sounds like a great party ! When did you get here ? Shozo ! Around the time you started talking about nuclear fallout . I know now , Kurawaki . You really want me to kill you . Look at this ! What 's that tinker toy ? This is the nuclear warhead 's detonator . It 'll activate the warhead when I die . I call this the the deadliest dick ? Give me a break . You 're wasting your time , Kurawaki . I 'll do anything to get you . Shoot me , and we 'll all die . I know you 're brainless but even you can figure this out . If you destroy my dick , your dad 's warhead will detonate ! You have only one choice . Kneel down and accept your defeat . I 'm my father 's son , after all . I only know one way to live . That 's my boy . You 're a yakuza ! Do what you have to do , Shozo ! Kurawaki , you 've got me wrong . You picked a fight with me and you thought I would back down ? What ... ? I am a yakuza . It doesn 't matter if it 's a gun or a nuclear weapon ! All that matters is life or death ! Shozo , kick their asses ! Do you understand the situation ? It 's nuclear weapon ! Fallout ! Death ! Shut up , you nerdy virgin ! I decided a long time ago to go wherever Shozo goes . And that includes hell ! Well said , Nayoko . That 's the way a yakuza 's wife should talk . You ... ! You 'll die slowly ! Wait ! This one 's for my dad ! And this one is for Tetsu ! You 've gone insane ! Junior ! No nuke scares a true yakuza ! Shozo ... I am the yakuza weapon !

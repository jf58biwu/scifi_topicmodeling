 Previously on Continuum : What the hell ? Time traveller , hello ? What year is this ? 2012 . Detective Carlos Fonnegra . Linda Williams , Portland P.D. Portland ? The Revolution is on our schedule . War begins now . They shot their way in , six dead here . Two in the alley . How old is your son , Keira ? That 's enough for tonight . 2077 , my time , my city , my family . When terrorists killed thousands of innocents , they were condemned to die . They had other plans . A time travel device sent us all back 65 years . I want to get home . But I can 't be sure what I 'll return to if history is changed . Their planned to corrupt and control the present in order to win the future . What they didn 't plan on , was me ! Suit operations is on the left . You 'll dump your CMR there . See the APOC for an assignment . Firing range is upstairs . Sonic clean 's down two . You follow ? Down two , yes , sir . This is the chip guy . You want me to do it ? What ? How does that feel ? Good ? Yeah . Hold your breath . Keep your eyes open . Is there a volume control for this thing ? Just think it , it will happen . It takes getting used to but with A CMR hardwired into your cortex , you become a passive recorder of all that you see , hear and smell . It can hold up to 36 hours of vid . No more disputed testimony . No more bad arrests . If it was me , every man , woman and child in the Union would be chipped . Name and Tag Number . Cameron , Kiera . 11-6-914 . One standard issue service weapon , one standard issue multi-tool . Sign here . You 're going to want to trust your gut out there , Cameron . Don 't . Instincts are good , but what make you a great Protector , is the tech . Hold the elevator . Kiera ? What Alec ? Sorry , couldn 't see your location there for a second . Something wrong ? I 'm upgrading my firmware . Your system eats a lot of bandwidth . Seems fine now . I look great . Yeah you do ! Boundaries , Alec . As a cop . My CMR is for business only . Why did you say that if you didn 't want me to hear ? Sometimes I get nervous in social situations and I talk to myself . You 'll figure it out . We 're both new at this . We good ? Route to the power station is clear . Lucas , device ready . Good to go . Let 's get ready to move out . Linda . Linda , Carlos is talking to you . Good morning . Good morning , Any news ? Not a peep . They 've gone underground . Dillon wants to put together a joint task force . FBI , CSIS , RCMP , all the letter agencies . Did you forget something ? Funeral 's today . I packed really quickly . I didn 't bring dress clothes . Betty Robertson . Linda Williams . From Portland . Yeah . Carlos , do you need a ride to the cemetery ? I 'll see you there . You can tell her she 's got nothing to worry about . Betty . You 're a good-looking guy . You 're just not my type . Nothing to worry about , huh ? Nope . Breakups are a bitch , aren 't they ? Yeah . He leave you ? I left him . It 's complicated . Yeah , isn 't it always . Carlos ... Move your ass , Kellogg . We can eat on the other side . Kellogg get dressed . You deaf ? My hearing is fine . I 'm not going . One goes , we all go , Kellogg . Or some of us go , or none of us go . Right ? Tell them what you told me . Tell us what , Lucas ? That we got here fusion powered but Lucas is getting us home on a 12 volt . Stop talking shit , Kellogg . Let the man speak . I 've run the calculations a dozen times , the grid should be enough to bring about fusion and power the device , but really ? I won 't know for sure until I push the freaking button so back off . Then we move ahead , as planned . Listen guys , what if this is where we 're supposed to be ? You scared of another trip down the rabbit hole ? No , I see a reason to stay . Look around . What do you see ? I see inequality , injustice , the rich getting richer . But freedoms still exist . The corporate rights act won 't be imposed for fifty years . We are free to tell people what 's being done to them , and by who , and no one will arrest or execute us . Hell , even the President gets on TV and tells corporations and the rich to suck eggs . Pretty speech . What are you really trying to say ? He wants us all to stay . With our knowledge of the future we can operate here virtually unchallenged . The Protector knows we 're here . She 'll stop us . How do you even know we 're going back to the right time ? I made the calculations . We 're good . Let 's put it to a vote . Who wants to stay ? Doesn 't look like it 's going your way , Kellogg . Let 's move . Pass our brothers my regards . See you in 60 years . Is there a problem ? Yeah , inspector wants to talk to you . Sure . This is Dan Barlow , Portland PD . Sergeant Barlow says he works with a Linda Williams . You 're not her . I can explain . You better be able to . Because if you 're not Linda Williams , who the hell are you ? What happens now ? Don 't talk to me . Are you even a cop ? Yes . You could have told me . That I share the same name as another detective named Linda Williams ? Yeah , what are the odds ? 1.7 million Williams 's at the time of the 2000 census . Third most common name in America . Third most common name in America . I 'm giving you the benefit of the doubt because you saved my life . Thanks . But that ends the minute you lie to me again . Understood . Now is the part where you tell me who you really are and what you 're doing here . That 's need to know . That 's not going to cut it . Am I under arrest ? Not yet . Mind if I stand ? Suit yourself . Now what ? We process you . What happens when you process me ? I guess we 're just going to have to wait and find out , aren 't we ? Alec ! Wake up ! You 're talking to me . Got it . Okay , processing , is bad . He 's going to run your prints . The cover I created for you won 't hold up . You going to run my prints , Carlos ? I 'm going to print you . I 'm going to check your story . Run you through NCIC , Interpol . NCIC is the National Criminal Database . Interpol is an organization of world police forces focused on human trafficking , terrorism . What are you doing ? That 's how we solve the problem . How ? With a thumb-print ? With a truth they can accept . She seem bothered by any of this to you ? She 's cooperating . You get a name ? No . Look , I 'd be dead if it weren 't for her . I hear where you 're going with that , but I need you to think for a second . She 's always one step ahead of this gang . For all we know she 's one of them . My gut 's telling me something different . If you have a conflict of interest I need to know . I 'm clear . You sure . There is no conflict . Take her downstairs . Process her . Until we get some answers all possibilities remain open . Including the ones we don 't like . ID ? It 's been a hell of a day today , man . Can 't wait until today is over . You can 't be in here ! Let 's move ! Are you kidding me ? You alright ? We 're stuck between floors . Give it a minute . Emergency generators will kick in . I 'm claustrophobic . Right . All units vicinity Hastings Sub-Station ... Hazmat team and a bus en-route ... containment perimeter , hazmat protocols in effect .. Hazmat ? Hazardous materials . Hazardous material teams . How wide-spread is the power outage ? I 'm sure they 're working on it . Power 's out across half the city . You need to tell your team to check for an explosion with no bomb fragments or combustible residue . You think your gang has something to do with this ? I need to see the Substation . Understand . In case you hadn 't noticed we 're stuck in an elevator . Come on ! I 'm hacking into surveillance cameras at the Sub-Station now . The Substation that was hit , is it nearby ? East 6th and Clark , but - - East 6th and Clark . We need to check it out . Correction , I will check it out . Once this elevator starts moving again , you 're going to holding . Finally . I 'm not going to holding , Carlos . What part of no don 't you understand ? No way . Did you just tase Carlos ? That is awesome ! What I 'm doing won 't always make sense to you . But it 's important . And I can 't do it without you . I can 't have you following me when this wears off ... Sorry . How do I make one of these function ? Keys . Do you see any ? No . Help me . You said it was a frequency generator . You opened the trunk . The green one ! It has keyless ignition . Now what ? Put your seat belt on just in case or it will draw attention . The strap thing . To your left . Press Start . Now use the shifter . Try the other handle . You ever driven a gasoline vehicle before ? Foot on the brake ! Left pedal ! Left pedal ! Put the shifter in D for drive . This is not a simulation . Not funny , Alec . Be right back . Thanks Mom , I 'm starving ! Alec , sweetheart ! Sorry , I just have a really busy , new project . Yo , step-bro . Alright then . Okay if I eat in the barn ? Sure . Do me a favour . Bring in your dirty dishes in so I don 't have to buy any more . And get your chores done ! Thanks Mom ! Alec ? Can 't talk , busy . What got into him all of a sudden ? I have no idea . But I do remember his father beeing like that . So excited by his work . Here . Thanks . So . I understand you want to open an investment account , Mister ... ? Kellogg . How much did you plan to start with ? All of it . Don 't act like you 've never been handcuffed to an elevator before . A key would be nice . What happened ? Someone broke his neck . Anything inside ? I heard the cops say they tried to hack the grid . Shorted it and blew the breakers from here to New West . Thanks . I 'm okay . The police just took an interest in me . What are they saying ? Tapping the police band ... Good news is witnesses reported five people matching the description of the gang leaving the substation . Okay . Bad news is there 's an APB out for you . What will they do now ? My hope is they locate a new power source . Hope , why ? So I can track them . If they go underground and blend in , I may never find them again . You seem to know a lot about these people . Not them personally , people like them . Men and women who hate and kill to impose their views on anyone who disagrees with them . Alright , well this is a little rad , even for me . But I just sent an image of Simon Fraser . He wrote an influential paper on the theoretical possibility of creating a sustained series of thermonuclear micro-explosions by beaming streams of charged heavy ions at a pellet of Deuterium Tritium propellant . We 're looking for a time travel device , not a rocket . They may be powered the same way . Look , this is just speculation , but unlike a chemical or fission explosion , fusion reactions release about four billion times more energy than the hydrogen oxygen mixture that powers the main engines of the Space Shuttle and 100 times more than the fusion reactions that goes on at the Sun 's core . Fraser 's work involves finding a way to safely harness the energy of fusion reactions to in theory make faster than light travel possible . Is this information public ? He 's famous , he 's on the cover of this months Wired . What is that ? It 's a magazine . We have to get to him first . Drop car turn up ? No , but I have units running down every bank , ATM and security camera in the area . Plus we are canvassing the neighborhood around the power station for witnesses . Five heavily armed gunman don 't just disappear for Christ 's sakes . Yes , I realize that . This is hard on all of us . You vouched for her . You find her . Fix it . You 're hovering . I wanted to let you know I 've been doing some digging . The Portland PD database was hacked by a third party server . That 's good ? Or bad , depending on who did the hacking . I 'm following the Linda Williams trail back to the originating server . He or she is using TOR to encrypt their TCP streams and cover their tracks , but I 've been following the gaps between incoming and outgoing packets and they 're narrowing . So you are going to find out who 's behind the curtain . Pretty soon , he 's going to over-stay his welcome and I 'm going to nail his ass . Good work . You 're a good cop , Carlos . Thank you . But people are talking . You 're going to tell me what they 're saying , aren 't you ? She 's making you look like a fool . She 's using you . And you don 't want to see that happen . No . I 'm on your side . There is something you could do for me . Anything . Find me the ID of that hacker . So on it . Mrs. Fraser ? Go away . I 'm a colleague of your husband . Is he home ? You need to go now . I 'll call the police ! I think that you and I both know the police are the last people you want to call right now . They said if I told anyone where they took him I 'd never see him again . The longer you wait to tell me , the harder it 's going to be for me to get him back . The Linear Collider at the University . Linear Collider ? Atom smasher . High velocity particles , incredible amounts of energy . Enough to power the device ? I 'm a genius and I can 't answer that question . But I 'd bet the answer 's yes . I need to take that phone . Take whatever you need . Please don 't let them hurt him . What 's with the phone ? We 're going to need backup . Fonnegra . Carlos . Linda ? Where the hell are you ? I need your help . My help ? Okay . Come down to the station and turn yourself in . I 'll see what I can do . It 's her . I know that 's what you want . But I think I have something you might like even more . What 's that ? Linda ... What ? Linda said she is going to text us in twenty minutes the address of where the gang is meeting . She said that she 's deep cover as one of them . She want us to come and arrest her . Hello . Are you lost ? My family used to live there . We live here now . I don 't understand . What do you want with the Linear Collider ? Wait , what are you doing ? The tungsten receptors in the containment chamber are placed to collect the maximum energy from the colliding particle . Please . Tampering with the containment chamber can cause all kinds of catastrophic results . At least let me help you calibrate it properly . I 'll take it from here . Thousands of people live nearby- - Get back ! He 's a scientist . Engineer . In a field that doesn 't even exist yet . I 'm that good . We done with him ? Give me a minute to test the system . If you tell me what you want , I 'll gladly make you ... What we 're doing isn 't exactly in the owner 's manual . You realize there is a real possibility that you could cause a complete system failure . You 're going to have a system failure if you don 't shut up . I know what I 'm talking about . You know I 'd listen to him professor you 're not the only one ... She text you yet ? Not yet . But get this . The cell she called belongs to a woman whose husband works at the University . We called his office said , they said he left hours ago . Did you try calling him ? No answer . Sending a unit over to the house . Alec , feed me a ground plan of the facility . Alec , there is an alarm going off , do you know what triggered it ? Alec ? I 'm back ! Kiera ? Kiera ? Why didn 't you contact Carlos ? I 'm not seeing any cavalry . I left him a trail of bread crumbs , he 'll follow it . We haven 't talked about your family in a while . No we haven 't . Miss them ? I think about them all the time . Is that why you left your cellphone back there ? Yes ... So Carlos follows you here , and you follow them there . Which for you will be home . I 'm going to miss you Alec . You don 't even know what you 're going back to . But I have to try . It 'll work out . I know how this ends , remember ? Carlos is going to be mad . He 'll get over it . If we all go back , everybody here will be safe . You really thought this through . I want to go home . Power readings like that are impossible . Billion Megavolts in a sustained proton collision . Your device is absorbing a hundred percent of the energy . You haven 't seen the best part yet . I think the Doctor 's seen enough for one night . Not if you want her to live . Any takers ? Too bad . There 's a couple of you I wouldn 't mind killing . Stay . Doctor Fraser , the sequence has begun , is there any way to stop it ? There is an emergency override . Any other way to cut the power ? Not until the cycle is complete . Excellent . You may go . He 's not going anywhere . I just added sparing him to the terms of our cease fire . Cease fire ? Along with some discretion . Just until we get to where we 're going . Bitch cop wants to come with us ! Bitch cop does . I 'll take silence as agreement that my terms are acceptable . I 'd shake on it , but that 'd mean touching you . Go . Gutsy coming here , one against five . I 'm counting on all of you wanting to get home in one piece as much as I do . You know all bets are off when we get to the other side . Watch your back . You double check the settings ? Double and triple . When the device powers up a portal opens . We go through , to 2071 Year we were supposed to arrive in the first place . Do it ! Everyone needs to come in closer . Mom , if you have to work catching bad guys , who 's going to tuck me in ? Nothing will change . So you 'll be home ? Yeah . Sometimes it will be me , sometimes it will be dad . Okay . How about this ? Every night when I come home , I will come in your room and kiss you . But I 'll be asleep . Then I 'll have to wake you up . You mean I get two tuck ins ? Sound off . One piece . I 'm good . Intact . Where 's the Protector ? Cease fire 's over . Lucas , get over here . Lucas ! Down ! Listen up ! We 'll flank them . We 're going to head upstairs and see if we can draw their fire . You four , on me . Got them all ! Curtis , cover me ! Lucas , way out ? Way out ? Outflow tubes . This way ! Guards , our cover ! Eat this ! Yeah ! Man down here ! Paramedics over here now ! Travis , wait up ! Travis ! I don 't know how to tell you this ... Without the drum roll . I 'm missing a piece . Move ! This time the cuffs stay on . Why is she under arrest ? She isn 't one of them . She 's a hero . She saved my life . What else went down in there Doctor ? I stand by what I 've said . So I get two tuck-ins ? Yeah , two tuck-ins . I love you . Me too . Good night . Well he 's certainly happy . What ? You promised to be honest with him . We both know the job , the nights you won 't make it home . Don 't make promises you can 't keep . That 's not fair . How high is her cover ? As high as it gets . Nice work . You don 't seem happy . Special Agent Cameron . Get the cuffs off her . You could have saved yourself a lot of trouble if you told me up-front that you were working for the Feds . But I do understand your need to keep things on a need to know . You do . Thanks . Don 't thank me . It was your idea . We ran your file . From what little we could access , it appears you have contacts we seem to lack . I do . I plan to establish a task force to take on this new threat . We could really use someone with a deep understanding of its methods and tactics , Special Agent . Say something . I ... That 's a yes . I could use some help . Until I get up to speed . Excellent . I 'm sure Detective Fonnegra won 't mind . You two seem to complement each other . I can work with that . Carlos ? Another yes . Great , we will see you tomorrow . Lady needs a place to hang her hat . Lockers are down the hall . Simon at the front desk gives out the combos . Don 't let him put you by the can . By the can , got it . Coffee station , do not eat the doughnuts . We got a lot of paperwork to fill out , don 't worry about it , we 'll fill it out tomorrow . You have a service weapon ? Not here . Use my backup for now . Is this desk free ? Yeah . I don 't know what you did , or how you did it , but we go looking for a file , and we find exactly what we 're looking for . Let 's start fresh tomorrow , I 'm all out of answers for tonight . I can work with that . Need a lift ? Go ahead , I want to clear my thoughts for a minute . Are you upset ? I have a husband and a son . And right now I 'm confronting the possibility that I may not make it back to them . I can 't imagine how that must feel . The only thing that 's going to get me through this is finding a way to believe that my being here is for a reason . That what I 'm doing will somehow help my family in the future while I 'm here in the present . Sounds reasonable . I hope you 're right . You want me to call you a taxi ? Thanks . You 're a taxi . That 's a joke . I know . - Good night , Alec . - Good night .

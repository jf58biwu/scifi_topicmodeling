 ♪ Translated by ♪ XQ2 ☻ If I 'd known how everything would turn out I 'd have done it all differently . I would have stayed invisible . A nobody . But I 'm no longer a nobody . I 'm one of the most wanted hackers in the world . Who am I ? I am Benjamin . And this is my story . He turned himself in an hour ago . He claims he 's the hacker WHOAMI . He said he can lead us to FR13NDS and the Russian cyber mafia He wants to talk only to you . And you are ' WHOAMI ' ? There 's some reason why you 're here . And why you got me here ... So ? Everything is somehow connected . There 's no one thread with a beginning and an end . It 's a tangle of threads And I 'm caught in the middle . I always wanted to be a superhero with a superpower I wanted to do things that nobody thought possible . In reality I already had a superpower I was invisible . I even had a superhero costume . - Paradise Pizza : the end of the rainbow Every superhero needs a tragic family story : Spiderman 's parents ... Dead . Batman 's parents ... Murdered . Superman 's parents ... Exploded . I actually had the best requirements My father ran away to France when I was born . I 've never met him . A similarity that I share with my grandma . Her father died in the Second World War The only memory she has of him are three bullet casings his buddy brought back from Russia My mom took her own life when I was 8 . The best material for a hero story . My grandma took care of me and later I took care of her . I 'm not a psychologist . I 'm not interested in your traumas . What do you know about CLAY ? About your alliance with ' FR13NDS ' ? Everything you want to know . But every detail is important . Hacking is like magic They 're both about deceiving others . Since I was 14 I spent my time in front of the PC . I learned programming languages , hacked my first system ; a universe of infinite possibilities . For the first time I felt like I was good at something . In real life I was an Omega among Alphas . An outsider , a loser , a freak . But on the net , I felt I belonged . A refuge for people like me . While everyone else wasted their time on the World-Wide-Web we met in the so-called Darknet , the net within the net . Here I could be whoever I wanted . I spent days and nights online . I got my sleep in the real world . But there was an antidote I got the idea from my biggest idol . There are a lot of great hackers out there . But only one true hero for me . He called himself MRX . He is from nowhere . No one knew who he was . He could hack into any system . He was the star of the scene . One of his most famous hacks was a social network attack He didn 't take anything or anyone seriously . He was THE superhero among hackers . I wanted to be like him . And he exploited an online pharmacy to get Ritalin ; the hacker 's waker-upper . MRX had 3 rules : 1st : no system is safe . 2nd : aim for the impossible . 3rd : Have fun in cyberspace and meatspace . In other words , don 't limit your fun to only the virtual world . But the real reason I 'm here now why it all ened up like this is Marie . Hey ! Resting 's never got anyone anywhere . Hope is the rainbow over the waterfall of our life . You wanna pass the exam ? Try learning ! Or do you hope someone will steal the exam questions for you ? I called Superman but he had no time . Shush yourself ! Spazz ! What kind of weirdo bird are you ? Paradise Pizza The end of the rain ... bow . During highschool I was desperately in love with Marie . But after ten years no one remembers the freak from the last row . Yes , again today ! - Clear the table ! - Finally something rational . I had Salami . That 'll be 34,28 . Hey , spaz , I said no anchovy ! I 'm not paying for this . Don 't be an ass , Oscar ! He always does this . Keep the change . - Are you crazy ? Mr. Anchovy will give you another 100 if you get the exam questions ; Bachelor of Law . The world doesn 't need a savior but everyday I hear people crying for one . - What ? - That 's from Superman . It 's okay . Thanks . - You 're such an ass ! - How about that for a freak ? I would finally be a superhero . Marie had a problem and I could solve it . I just had to get her the exam questions . She 'd remember me , We 'd fall in love get married , have kids , be happy together . Bingo . The bachelor exams were stored on the university 's central server I just needed access . It was almost too easy . Most of the hackers just crack the threshold , look around the system and don 't change a thing Others leave a note . And many , take a souvenir . I was Superman , Spiderman , Batman What are you doing there ? I was an idiot . No entries , no previous conviction 50 hours of community service . Do something with your life ! It 's up to you ! My 50 hours of community service meant cleaning a city I didn 't care about It couldn 't be any worse . Not even the Ritalin worked anymore . But everything was about to change in one fell swoop . So , why are you here ? Can 't you speak , or what ? Then don 't . Let me guess ... you 're the type who thinks life 's unfair to them , who feels ignored all the time , like the refuse of society . In school you weren 't even beaten up because nobody gave a rat 's ass about you . All very , very sad . Y 'know what I think ? It 's bullshit . A scam . Computer stuff . And you ? This and that . What 's your thing , huh ? DDoS attacks ? Botnets ? Phishing ? Or are you just a script kiddie ? I hacked the University 's server . How did you gain access ? Using a zero-day exploit . You can read machine language ? Just like that ? M-hm ! I 'm Max . Benjamin . Any plans for today ? I keep wondering if there was a moment when all the threads converged . That moment which changes everything . I 'm the king of the world ! Boo ! The later the evening , the drunker the guests . How do you like my modest temple to decadence ? I don 't even know half these people . All fucking freeloaders ! Max was the total opposite of me Self-confident , charismatic A winner Close the door ! Krass . Cool office . Yeah , let me introduce you . This is Benjamin . Stephan Benjamin Benjamin Engel . Stephan was the software master He could find a bug in any program He 's always been totally insane . He lived for kicks . The wackier , the better . - No last names . - Paul was a total hardware freak Give him a paper clip and a motherboard and he 'll build you anything . Like me , he lost his mother early . His rich father shoved him in a boarding school and devoted himself to more important things . Don 't mind him , his smile muscles were removed at birth . Max said you can read machine language Machine language ? Anyone can say that ! It 's not something you can just pull out of your ass ! Prove it . Or you won 't leave here alive Engel . Jackpot ! Paul . Benjamin . Just Benjamin . The fun really starts now ! Shit ! Don 't worry , they 're not here for that . What ? Did you think I live here ? Come on ! Who 's responsible for this Megaparty ? - No idea . - Come on . Make way ! Make way ! You 're the Pizza Bird . Do you know each other ? It 's his party ! What the fuck ? You fuckers ! GO ! This way ! No last names . I always stopped at warnings . Never asked again , after that . Stop ! I can 't go on . I can 't take another step . See ya later . Come on ! What ? Now I remember you . Benjamin , Benjamin Engel ! Our teacher forgot you on a school trip , and you had to go home alone by train . It 's been interesting the evening . Bye . Bye . We all knew this day would come . Your grandma needs professional help . You must let go ! She 's in really good hands here with us . My grandma was diagnosed with Alzheimer 's 4 years ago . Every day an invisible eraser erases more and more of her edges . Tickets , please ! I thought the cops still had you . Not a good idea to violate parole the very first week . What 's wrong ? Moping won 't make it better . Come , I 'll show you something ! Come on ! I should 've simply sat there But it was like an invisible rope between us . He told me how he started hacking I hung on every word . You know , people lull themselves into a sense of security . They 've no idea what 's going on out there . Security . Everyone wants security . There is no security ! Once you understand this , you know , you have the world on a platter . All you have to do is help yourself . As different as we were , we had one thing in common . 1st : don 't limit your actions to the virtual world 2nd : audacity triumphs . 3rd : No system is safe - No system is safe - MRX ? - MRX ? Never hide behind your computer . MRX knows this . The greatest vulnerabilities are not in programs or servers . The main security flaw , is man . - You hack people ? - Exactly . The most effective of all hacking methods , the great art of deception : Social engineering . Man is by nature trusting and averse to conflict . With social engineering you exploit these two components to get anything you want : Passwords , secret information , login data Hungry ? Hold this ! Watch and learn . Sorry dear , won 't be long . 2 chocodonuts are missing . I don 't like paying for shit and not getting it . Is that your new promotion ? Pay for 10 , get 8 ! The chocolate ones were missing ? I wouldn 't be standing here if they weren 't . Who served you this ? The blonde back there . Come on , maybe we 'll just get the manager ? There you go ! Have a good evening ! All good ! You must simply be bold enough , then the world is at your feet . Oh , so late ! Are you ready ? Come on let 's go . But ... Where are we going ? Come on . Go on ! Why did you bring him ? You 've no idea if we can trust him ! Relax , you saw what he can do . You can drive . Don 't get your knickers in a twist . We 'll bring it back . You 'll never get in , looking like this ! - Why 's he going ? - You wait here . I thought I was going ! - What are you up to ? - Not ' you ' , WE ! Come on , get dressed ! Chop-chop !

For weeks he tried to get a reaction from MRX about CLAY . He wanted recognition from his biggest idol If you wanna be part of the big boys you gotta have balls . - What about CLAY ? - CLAY , who ? We 're all fucking losers ! We 're fucking losers ! But MRX didn 't give a shit about us . There were other big players out there . Around this time you entered the game . And I now give the floor to Hanne Lindberg , Head Cybercrime Investigator for Europol Last night , there was an attack on the European Central Bank of Frankfurt . We assume the same hackers are involved who are behind the attacks on the German Army 's servers . They call themselves FR13NDS . We 're talking about organized crime . These are not pimply nerds . FR13NDS is part of the Russian cyber mafia They 've hacked , in recent years , many international targets . The group has been linked to 4 pseudonyms 3 of them are : SecDet , Towboat und Krypton . The last one is still unknown . Their captured data gets sold on the so-called darknet . The business is controlled by the Russian cyber mafia . According to latest investigations at least one of the FR13NDS seems to operate from Berlin . Our Special Commission coordinates with Europol investigations . Nobody knows FR13NDS ' organization and processes better than Hanne Lindberg Is it true you 've been after FR13NDS for 3 years ? So far , without success ? Yes ! OK . Any other questions ? Good . Hanne ! I just wanted to say ... Glad to see you . I hope you don 't have any problems with this . No . No . I 'm glad to be working with you . Good . One more thing ... The fact that we were together , nobody needs to know . People talk , they lose focus . While you were hunting FR13NDS , Max quelled his frustration over MRX . Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Go for a little spin ? Max and Stephan borrowed one of Paul 's toys and tampered with the phone lines of a radio contest . They blocked all lines except one so only Max could get through . Hello !

CLAY does not belong to the Big Players " ... The package had only one purpose : He wanted make this clear to us that in his eyes CLAY was no more than a bunch of babies . Fuck !

Max , that 's enough Let 's go , come on . Nobody . Nobody Without the others knowing it I 'd stolen encrypted data from the BND server . I have a present for you . First he manipulated the printers over the communication protocol then he cracked the internal security firewall and stole archive data . Our unhackable system took 2 minutes 23 , to hack . You say that like you were thrilled about it . Whoever did this is a genius . They must have entered at 3 : 08 , deleted all the video files and left that . But everything has consequences Every single wing flap . That was found about his body . He was found in the woods . Moritz Lauer , better known as Krypton . Good morning ! Out , out ! All of you , go ! I said , leave . Get lost ! What the fuck ? you need us ! What ? ! I need you ? Or maybe you need me ! You know what ? You 're nothing ! Nothing but a fucking fake ! All you can do is use and manipulate people ! Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! Be quiet ! - Stop it ! QUIET ! This morning a body was found . A hacker by the pseudonym of KRYPTON His death seems to be connected to the hacker attack on the German Secret Service last night . The BND faces quite possibly the biggest scandal in its history . Near the body , was also found the BND 's hacked data , containing a top secret list that revealed Krypton was a BND undercover agent . It appears Krypton belonged to the hacker group FR13NDS Did the BND finance criminal hackers with taxpayer money ? All indications , at this time , are that the hacker group CLAY is responsible for the BND break-in . You were the only one in the server room ! What did you do ? We said we 'd touch nothing , take nothing . Our goal was only the printers ! Did you take any data ? I , I found a hidden partition on the BND server I cracked the password and downloaded some kind of employee list I don 't know ... I sent it to MRX . - Are you stupid ? - Yeah , man ! I wanted to prove it to him ! To all of you ! You thought I 'm a nobody ! Sometimes we hold so tight to an image of someone , that we no longer recognize the true self behind it . Everyone sees only what they want We should take care of Krypton ! Suddenly , it was clear to us . MRX has sold the data to the Russian cyber mafia MRX belongs to the FR13NDS They found out Krypton worked for the BND and killed him ! Now everyone thinks we did it ! It 's all your fault ! It 's all my fault . Dammit . Shit , shit ! Russian make . Krypton collaborated with the authorities and was eliminated . OK , what 's this got to do with CLAY ? I don 't know . You should say say something . This morning , I received a call from The Hague . They wanted me to make an evaluation ... of you ... your work I didn 't know your position was shaky . Why didn 't you tell me ? The Rise and Fall of a hacker collective ... celebrated as pop stars and Robin Hoods of the hacker scene ... and now linked to the Russian mafia Cyber mafia ... and the murder of a hacker . We ask ourselves : Who is CLAY , really ? Where are you going , please ? The printers were fun . This isn 't fun anymore ! Krypton is dead , Max , dead ! And we triggered a fucking Secret Service scandal , man ! Benjamin could go to the police and tell them he set up this shitty CLAY by himself ! You wanna sacrifice one of us ? You wanted to get rid of him ! I don 't care what you do , I 'm out ! - Stephan , wait . This is all my fault ! I must find MRX ! And then , what ? It 's not about us , they 're after MRX and FR13NDS . They 're the target ! Benjamin is right . Running gets us nowhere . Hundreds officers are tracking us it 's just a matter of time until they get us ! If we deliver MRX and FR13NDS we 'll be invisible again . Exactly . I mean WE , not YOU ! Shit , shit , shit ! Oh my god ! what happened to you ? I 'm fine . What do you want ? Um , last night ... Um , last night you suddenly disappeared and I thought ... - I thought we ... - Do you want Max ? Max ? No ! Listen , it 's better you go now . Are you building a bomb in there , or what ? Is there anything you want ? What 's wrong with you ? You 're all weird . Exactly ! That 's all you see ? A comical freak . You know what ? I wish I 'd never met you ! We had to find MRX . And I was the bait . Meanwhile were so paranoid that we only used public networks . Don 't fuck up , understand ? Oh , here you are ! Come quickly , we have something ! I ran across it , quite by chance . WHOAMI tried to contact MRX . His IP address is spoofed , going through several intermediaries , using hundreds of different servers in Europe , changing his location every 3 seconds . But , I think I got something . The server WHOAMI uses , always responds to this IP address . Looks like a hub in Berlin . OK , let me know when you pinpoint the location . He gave me access to a private channel .

I 've been suspended . They 're sending someone else from The Hague . I 'm sorry . What did MRX want ? That we plant a Trojan in the Europol system . Whoever has access to Europol , can monitor the investigation and manipulate it . And what was your plan ? We wanted to know who is MRX . His identity for our freedom . We wanted to prove that he 's behind Krypton 's death . We wanted to disappear from the most wanted list . We wanted to be invisible again . To access MRX 's computer we had to dig deep into our bag of tricks . Stephan called the program " Pregnant Horse " . It was a Trojan inside a Trojan . The moment MRX used our backdoor to log onto the Europol server we 'd be able to access his computer . And MRX 's mask would fall . But first we had to destroy all traces . I wanted to apologize to you ... for the black eye and because of Marie . You knew all along what she meant to me and you didn 't give a shit . I ... Ah , shit , man . What can I say ? I 'm an asshole . For once you 're right . And , um ... I 'm a phoney ! I could never do what you can . I 'm just a shitty script kiddie . I can only copy and paste .

We had to enter the lion 's den but it was layed out like Fort Knox . We tried dumpster diving . No go . Our old phishing methods , got no bites . We even tried to get in through the drains . - Fuck ! - That 's the only entrance . Shit ! What are you doing there ? Fuck ! - What is it ? - A fucking nail ! - Fuck ! - Don 't pull it out !

Frau Sturm ? - Yes ? - Hanne Lindberg , Europol . I 'd like to ask you some questions . Ok . Do you know this person ? No . Benjamin Engel ? He said you were in the same class ? Benjamin Engel . Right , the freak . He always sat behind us . Have you seen Benjamin since then ? No . Sorry , what 's this all about ? Benjamin is in the custody of the BKA . He said that in the last few months you met often . Sorry , we what ... ? ! He 's not all there . Sorry , but , I 'd never willingly meet a guy like that ! Thanks for taking the time to see me . It 's about Hilde Engel . - Or rather , her grandson . - Benjamin . - You know him ? - Since he was a little boy . I treated his mother . What can you tell me about him ? He 's closed off . An outsider . No wonder , given his history . His mother took her own life . Benjamin grew up in a tangle of conflicts . His mother suffered from dissociative identity disorder . Schizophrenia ? Multiple personality disorder She had 4 personalities . All aspects of herself . Medication kept things temporarily at bay . Finally she couldn 't take it anymore . Is it hereditary ? Possibly . What triggers it ? There may be a predisposition , or tendency , triggered by a traumatic event . Certain medications can aggravate symptoms . There are several triggers . Ritalin ? Ritalin is one of them . But what exactly is this about ? Is Benjamin alright ? The lab results are in ! Let me guess . The cartridges are from WW II . Yes ... Where did you get this wound ? Max 's hand was injured . Why did you have the car keys ? Stephan drove to NBD . And what did you tell me about Paul ? About his mother ? She died when he was little . That was you ! All of them are you ! No . They 're dead ! There are no bodies ! No trace ! In any damn hotel in The Hague ! What did you really see in the hotel room ? They don 't exist . You created them in your imagination . CLAY , is you alone . You are Max ! What ? Did you think I live here ? You are Stephan ! Ole Thurgen . Danish People 's Front . You are Paul ! Every action , it was you ! Alone ! I don 't even know half the people . All fucking freeloaders ! We need a name ! We must become a brand ! We must become famous ! Attention is counterproductive . We 're staying under the radar . Fuck the radar ! A brand is awesome ! Like Anonymous or LulzSec ! Like MRX ! Ah , fucking nail ! Bingo . I 'm not like my mother ! I know who I am I know , who ... That means that our agreement ... This disqualifies you for the witness protection program . No ! You said we have a deal We have a deal . I get the witness protection program , that 's what you said ! I 'm sorry ! They killed Krypton I betrayed MRX . They 'll find me ! Do you understand ? We had a deal ! I get witness protection ! That 's what you promised ! I 'm sorry . You 're sick ! I 'm not like my mother ! I 'm not like my mother . I 'm not like my mother . I 'm sorry ! FR13NDS will kill me like they killed Krypton ! I want the witness protection program ! You promised me ! Congratulations ! The collaboration between Europol and BKA ( Fed . Criminal Police ) was from the start highly professional , efficient and productive . Mainly responsible for this is Hanne Lindberg who dealt an exceptional blow to the cyber mafia The Internet is not a legal vacuum . The actors are not invisible . Everybody leaves traces . I asked if I could bring you before the court . What did mama say then ? I 'm sorry I hacked you ! It was wrong of me . The witness protection program is literally a ' program ' . You have 5 minutes What will you tell them ? That you ran off on the way to the courthouse Won 't you be fired again ? They wanted MRX and FR13NDS . You 're nobody to them ! You 're invisible to them ! Promise me you 're through with hacking . I promise . No more magic tricks . Wait ! One more thing How do you do this trick ? If you know how it works , it 's almost disappointing . Everyone sees what they want to see . Take care ! [ Birth certificate ] She swallowed it . The greatest social engineering trick of all time . Not even Europol knows who you are , now . What name did you pick ? No name OK . Who am I ? I 'm Benjamin . I 'm a hacker . and this is my story . Hacking is like magic They 're both about deceiving others . Where were you ? They have my computer ! They know who I am , we gotta split , all of us ! What happened ? I was at Europol . How did you get in there ? I pretended to be from a school group . It doesn 't fuckin ' matter ! The transfer was a trap ! They have all my data ! Everything ! You understand ? We gotta split . Immediately ! Come on , what are you waiting for ? You 're one of us ! We won 't leave you in the lurch ! So , what now ? No system is unhackable . Here , as I said : Excluded from the witness protection program are people with mental illness . Once more from the beginning : Give her the information , piecemeal . It works only if you let the thing come out by itself . And she mustn 't feel manipulated . You can do it ! That 's all that 's missing Ready ? Fuck ! We 're all invisible ! What if she checked ? Don 't worry , she has checked . But she has what she wanted . No more magic tricks . ♪ Translated by ♪ XQ2 ☻

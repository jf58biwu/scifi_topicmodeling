 COSIMA : Okay , define orphan , Sarah . Orphan , orphanage . So , you don 't know your birth parents ? No , I was fostered out then legally adopted and I came here . - COSIMA : When ? - Adopted , like , eight . Came here around 12 . Heartbreaking . Can we get back to Beth , please ? Suicide ? I don 't accept that . This one 's some kind of low-life grifter . How do we know she didn 't push her ? Oi ! I already told you , I didn 't wanna be her . I got stuck . I was running from my own shit . - I can only imagine . - Alison . I 'm very sorry about Beth , okay ? But she was ( SIGHS ) losing it , like clinically . She was a cop . She had tools . If she couldn 't cope , then I mean ... ( SNICKERS ) Look , can you just tell me what the hell this is ? - Don 't tell her anything . - Uh , short answer ? No . ( CHUCKLES ) - How are we all related ? - We 're not . Well , we are , by nature . Um , she 's referring to nurture . Just give us the briefcase that you got from the German . I 'm not giving you shit till you give me some answers . You don 't rate answers . - Alison ... - Fine , she wants in ? We 're clones . We 're someone 's experiment and they 're killing us off . Is that helpful ? Hmm ? GEMMA : Mummy ? Gemma , come here . Who are those ladies ? Just ... ( STAMMERING ) They 're just mummy 's friends . Why did you get out of bed ? Sorry . I wanted to float that whole clone thing a lot softer . Come on , Sarah ... Oh , shit . You 're not supposed to be parked here at night . Um , I 'm ... I 'm waiting for someone . Well , this is a Neighborhood Watch block , so ... - Come on , girl . - ( WINDOW WHIRRS UP ) ( sums ) Bitch that guards hell . ( sums ) Screw it . - ( GATE CREAKING OPEN ) - ( DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE ) ( GATE CLOSES ) COSIMA : We are genetically identical , or whatever . ( STAMMERS ) It 's actually kinda cool . Um , as far as ... Shit . Shit ! So ... Was there someone there ? - Oh , my God ! - Freeze ! What are you doing in my yard ? Don 't ! Do not shoot me , please ! - Why are you here ? - Do not shoot , please . - Hey , Alison . Alison . - Okay . - Put it down . - Get out of the way . He 's with me . - Okay ? - Move ! ( SOFTLY ) It 's okay . - ( GASPING ) - Oh , shit . You point a gun at my brother again I will kick the living shite out of you ! ( ALISON PANTING ) ( SOBBING ) We need to get my shit . What the hell were you doing here ? Hey , you need this ? You just broke the first rule of clone club . What ? Never tell anyone about clone club ? Hi . Uh , awkward . I 'm Cosima . ( PLACING PHONE ON PALM ) You have my number . You want answers , I want the briefcase . Seriously , it 's life or death . FELIX : You 've got to be kidding me . Clones ? Clones ? ( SIGHS ) They 're not me . They 're not . They 're completely different people . " Soccer mum " Sarah . " Dreadlock science geek " Sarah . Arguably more attractive than your " evil " Sarah . Yeah , I was there . Thank you . How can it be , though ? What difference does it make , Fe ? Last time I checked , human cloning was illegal , let alone impossible . Yeah , leave it out , okay ? It doesn 't matter . It does matter ! Dead Beth , dead German . Those two , three other Euros , you , that 's eight . And Dreadlocks is going on about a blood sample saying it 's life or death . You can 't just ignore it . Yes , I can . I 'm just me , okay ? The song remains the same . We get the 75 grand back from Beth 's partner , we get Kira , and we get as far away from all this as possible . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Am I going insane ? ( INDISTINCT TALKING IN OFFICE ) Hey , Beth , thought you were still off . Uh , yeah . Just can 't get enough . Um , is Art around ? ART : Beth , what the hell 's going on ? SARAH : Uh , yeah . I 've gotta talk to you for a couple of seconds . Hey . Company ? Yeah . Look , things are bad with Paul . - Okay . - We 're dividing up our shit . Any second he 's gonna find that joint account empty . Look , you get the cash when you 're back on active duty . That 's the deal . Childs . - Sorry , just saying hello . - No , you 're not . Both of you . Bad news . You 're reinstated . ART : Holy shit . LIEUTENANT : Welcome back . Well , thank God . Buckle up , kid . You got a 10-45 . Uh ... Hey . Two seconds . SARAH : ( SIGHING ) Shit . ( TOILET STALL DOOR OPENS ) Do you want help with that ? Yeah , you mind ? ( SCOFFS ) FEMALE DISPATCHER OVER RADIO : Rory Road and Alister , confirmed 10-45 . Forensic on site . So , Art , about our deal . I 'm reinstated now ... Hey , I 'm not carrying around 75 grand in the trunk , all right ? Just call us in . Heading for the 10-45 . Roger . DISPATCHER : Responder , please identify . Uh ... 55 . 55 . Heading for the 10-45 . Roger . - Out . - Copy . ( SARAH CLEARING THROAT ) What ? Something wrong ? ( INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER POLICE RADIO ) - ( SARAH SIGHING ) - ART : Body 's chewed up pretty bad . What do you think ? I think that some idiot didn 't realize they were burying a body next to an active quarry . ( GASPING ) Got a pretty good tire print over there . I 'd say the body wasn 't in the ground more than two , maybe three days . Hey , welcome back . Now , this would be your industrial sausage maker . Nice of them to lend a hand , though . - ( CHUCKLES ) - ( JANIS CHUCKLES ) Print ? JANIS : They better hit ' cause , uh ... Reconstructing the face is gonna be tough . Hey ! Can we get the guy to open this thing up ? Uh ... I need to , uh , make a call , yeah ? One sec . ( INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER POLICE RADIO ) SARAH : I can 't talk or meet . Just answer the question . Oh , okay , okay . Um ... Our fingerprints are close enough to flag a match , yeah . - Why ? - Beth 's partner found the German . At least part of her . - Part of her ? - Yeah . Um , I messed up when I buried her . They have a fingerprint , Cosima . - Oh , wait , are you being Beth right now ? - Yes . Yes , I 'm at the bloody crime scene pretending to be a bloody cop . So I need to know if the bloody fingerprints will flag a bloody match . Whoa . Okay , okay . Don 't freak out . They need to use Interpol to find the German , which is unlikely . But , um , if one of us had a criminal record here ... ( sums ) Do you have a criminal record ? Just ... Petty fraud , assault , whatever . Wasted youth , all right ? If the body matches me , the cops will see a mug shot of somebody who looks like Beth . Only , it 's yours truly , and I 'm already supposed to be dead . Wow , wow . Welcome to the trip , man . ( SIGHING ) That is not helpful . Yeah , okay , sorry . Just don 't bolt . Okay , don 't bolt . They can 't run prints instantaneously , so we do have some time here . How much time ? Bring me the briefcase and we 'll talk . Okay ? Beckwith will have an exact time of death soon , but till then , I say we ballpark two , three days , see who 's missing . And , uh , fingerprints ? About a couple of days ? Yeah , you know the lab . Hopefully overnight . Uh , look , Art , um , this shit with Paul is about to go sideways , okay ? I need to get to the bank . Let me see your weapon . - Huh ? - Come on . Show it to me . It 's empty - Yeah , well , we left in a hurry . You rode with me empty . Art , it 's a 10-45 for legs . Right , Art ? Like , I mean , who am I gonna shoot ? That 's bullshit , Beth , for regs and your partner . Look , if this shooting has you trigger-shy , Beth , you got ... No , I 'm not . I 'm not . I 'm not . Just give me an hour or two to get up to speed , for Christ 's sake . You can " get up to speed " on the desk , then . I 'll work this with Deangelis . Now , get out of here . - Hey , Art ... - Look , if you ask me about that money one more time , Beth , I swear to God , it 's going in the shredder . ( POP MUSIC PLAYING ) Hey . Don 't worry , you get used to it . Two clones ? Yeah , I 'm not buying that . How many of us you need to meet , Sarah ? Can I have the briefcase , please . I want some answers first . You know what ? The answers are in the briefcase . Let me guess , you 're the smart one , you 're the wild one . Would you believe we 're clones ? ( BARTENDER CHUCKLES ) - Bourbon , rocks . - You got it . So you 're the scientist the German talked about . Uh , yes . Well , PhD student , um ... Uh , evolutionary developmental biology at University of Minnesota . I 'm heading back there tonight . The German was sick . Should I be worried about that ? Well , if you give me the case , I 'll know in a couple of weeks . Do you know who shot her in the head ? ( EXHALES ) Okay . ( CLEARS THROAT ) So , six months ago , uh , Katja contacted Beth with this crazy story about her genetic identicals being hunted in Europe . Hunted ? ( ( SIGHS ) - ls ) Brilliant . I know . So , so , Beth used facial recognition software to find driver 's licenses in North America . Two matches . - You and soccer bitch . - Yes , right . But who is the original ? Who 's created us ? Who 's killing us ? We need to know , but we lost our cop . So , however you managed to get into her shoes , we really need you to stay there . Stay a cop to help you . To help us . Help us find out who 's killing us . How ? I 'm not a cop . Beth 's partner 's gonna figure that out . Being Beth is what got me into this mess in the first place . I know , I know . I get it , I get it . But you can 't run away from her . Look , we are your biological imperative now . Okay ? Katja 's fingerprints will match your fingerprints . So , get to Katja 's fingerprint results somehow . I think that 's our only option . All right . Just answer me one thing . Anything : yes If we 're genetically identical , do you get that little patch of dry skin between your eyebrows ? ( CHUCKLES ) That 's good . Try to keep your sense of humor . ( SIGHS ) Beth couldn 't . No cream ? ( TYPING ) Booked on the range , day after tomorrow , 4 : 00 . The range ? The gun range . You with me or not ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . So , what about Jane Doe ? Beckwith filled a bucket with fragments from the hopper . Couple solids so far . Dyed red hair , like bright red . And laying out the skull fragments she 's 99 % sure she found entry and exit wounds . Shooting . So , what about the prints ? Start calling . And keep calling while you clear that shit pile of a desk . Hey , sorry about poaching your seat on this , eh ? - He 's all yours . - ( CHUCKLES ) - Let 's go . - Yeah . ( PHONE RINGING ) Detective Bell . Yeah , well , what can you tell me about her ? ( WHISPERING ) Jane Doe . Hey , hey . Shh , shh . Uh , you ... You want to give me that again ? DISTORTED RUSSIAN ACCENTED VOICE : Am I speaking to your partner now , too , Art ? Actually , we love voice change apps , so ... The whole office is listening . She was just one of a few , unfit for family . Horse glue . ART : So you didn 't like her very much . How about you tell us her name ? She expired at Allenside Park . ( LINE DISCONNECTS ) ANGELA : Fuck . So , what , Stephen Hawking did it ? ( SIGHS ) No , no , no . The call came to me . " Just one of a few unfit for family . " ANGELA : " Horse glue " ? Shit . Art , what else did they say ? They asked if I was the lead on the " quarry body " . Listen , before we go , - we 'll check the desk to see who took the call . - ANGELA : Yeah . Uh , you going to Allenside ? Yeah . Check the log to see if there were any shots fired down there . Okay , look , I 'll see you in a bit . Okay ? ( TYPING ) ( INDISTINCT TALKING IN OFFICE ) Hey ... Raj . Detective . Beth . - Hi . - Um , so you probably know I 've been off for a while . - Yeah . - Yeah . Uh , nightmare . PTSD , fatal civilian shooting , enquiry , medication , the whole enchilada . - Gum ? - Uh ... Thanks . So , I guess you 're back , then , right ? Mmm , I 'm benched . I 'm trying to slip in without , you know , a ripple , ( INHALES ) but on the down low , I 'm a little scattered , memory-wise . You think you could help me with a few basics ? Oh , like resetting your password ? Yes , like that . And the whole procedure for fingerprint results . I said an hour , Childs . - I haven 't checked yet . - They 're in , though ? 'Cause I got a Jane Doe with zero leads . They 're probably in my inbox . Just hang on . Yep , not a problem . - Childs ... - " Results from Central ... " I 'm helping you out . TECHNICIAN : I gotta log those . - ( CLICKING ) - it 's all good . Nothing , anyway . Don 't do that again , Childs . I don 't know , Art . You think someone 's jerking your chain ? ( ART sum-nus ) - Auto glass . - Hmm . Looks like a fast exit that way . I don 't see any casings . ( sums ) Could be line of fire . - The range . - Hmm . I 've seen her elaborate ruses and guises before , but how do you do this ? How do you fake your own demise beneath a train ? Wouldn 't you rather know why ? I don 't care to know why . Because I saw a way to dump Vic and get out of that life . And get away with Kira . ( SNIGGERS ) Take her on the run with you . Brilliant . New clothes and a Jaguar do not a mother make . The other point . ( SIGHS ) I don 't remember . Buffleheads . Barrow 's goldeneye . Just passing through . I 'll set up a visit . But the only way you will regain custody of Kira is to show me that you can be still . You 're not her legal guardian . Mine either , anymore . You can visit any other approach and I will stop lying to Social Services for you . You wouldn 't do that to Kira . No . I 'd do it to you . Hey , someone cleared this out . Laid down in here . Around here ? Probably homeless . Yeah . But someone moved this into position . Hey , this look like a blind to you ? A log for someone to lay a rifle on ? Weeds knocked down for sightlines . Where are you ? COSIMA : Um , back at school . What ? School ? What ? Oh , shit , right . Right , right , right . Minneapolis , shit . Uh , what 's going on ? Well , I managed to scrap the fingerprint results for a while anyway . But the killer contacted Art , Cosima . He 's already at the scene where Katja was shot . Okay , that 's good . Just ... Just stick with him . I can 't . He 's ... He 's benched me because I 'm bloody useless . I need help , Cosima . He wants me on the range tomorrow . I 've never even fired a gun . All right . Well , just hold tight , we know somebody who can help with that . - You serious ? - If you are . ( EXHALES ) You know we got a motorcycle tread over here , Art . - Yeah ? - Yeah . Yeah , it 's a good print , could be the shooter 's getaway . Yeah , but a long gun on a motorcycle . Could be the weapon broke down , right ? Yeah , it could be . Hey , I got something over here . ( CAMERA CLICKS ) Headshot . Bright red hair . It has to be this morning . Art 's got me chasing down motorcycle models from tire tracks , and I 'm shooting bloody targets at a gun range tomorrow . Well , I can 't just conjure a sitter out of thin air . It 's weekend primetime , Sarah . - ( SIGHS ) Well , then we 're all screwed . - ( KNOCK ON DOOR ) Aren 't we ? Donnie ... ( CLEARS THROAT ) Can you watch the kids for a couple of hours today ? - Golf . - Give it . - On television ? - No , I have a tee time , remember ? ( MAN ON TV TALKING ) ( SIGHS DEEPLY ) I 'm sorry , I 'm coming up empty . I may have a solution . Gemma , Oscar , this is Felix . Hello . - Brilliant . - So , I 'm going out for a couple of hours . So you be good . Mommy 's gonna be very upset . Okay ? Same goes for you . So , what now ? Does your daddy have a drinks trolley ? What 's that ? Don 't worry , I 'll find it . You . - You want to dress up like a little girl ? - No . Well , I don 't have anything for you then . I 'll dress up like a boy . We can work with that . RAJ ON PHONE ' . No , the make and model matched the tread that Deangelis sent you . A sports bike Suzuki SV650 . Oh , black tank , custom pipes , and stolen when ? Uh , reported four days ago . I ... I should probably get back to my real job now . Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , just put out a ... You know ... - An APB . - Yes . Yes , ASAP . Um , sorry , I 'm at the doctor . My phone 's about to die . Okay . I 'll get someone to do it . Thanks , Raj . ( CELL PHONE BEEPS ) ( EXHALES ) Well , go . ( GUNSHOTS ) Okay , reload , try again . So most city cops carry Glocks , but a Walther P99 , it has an optional-sized handgrip . It 's good for women , Beth said . ( SIGHS ) Particularly women living their lives like rats in a lab . Is that what you think ? Well , what else could it be ? Someone is covering up their illegal experiments by wiping us out . Well , whatever it is , I need to protect my family . So Beth taught me how to shoot . For that I 'm grateful to her . I 'm sorry you lost her . Uh , but anything you can tell me about her will help . Well ... I fail to see how someone like you can fill Beth 's shoes . Truth is I barely knew Beth . She was all business but I admired her , she didn 't cry , she was discreet , she didn 't bring her foster brother to my house . I didn 't know the rules of clone club , did I ? Can you not use the c-word ? Please ? - ( GUNSHOTS ) - ( GLASS SHATTERING ) Shit . ALISON : Stop here . I 'll walk the rest . ( sums ) So my bottom line is my children can 't know their mother is a freak . Things have to stay on a need-to-know basis . - Yeah , I 'm fine with that . - Good . ( INHALES DEEPLY ) - So , we made a decision to trust you . - Really ? Sarah , this is my life now , and I 'm doing the best I can . ( CLEARS THROAT ) So Beth had , um , a substantial sum , sort of a fund , she used to buy information we couldn 't get officially . Okay . We were a cop , a scientist and myself . The fund was how I could contribute . - How much ? - 75,000 . You could rob me blind . But we 're hoping you realize you can 't run away from this . So can you con her bank or not ? Good . ( CAR DOOR CLOSES ) Oh , Gemma ! Look , Mom , we 're cross-dressers . - No , you are not . - I 'm you . Oh , you 're back . - Felix . - OSCAR : Don 't go ! Can Felix stay the night , Mom ? No . My work here is done , I 'm afraid . - No ! - Stay , Felix . Adios , dragsters ! - Wow . Okay , so the money belongs to Alison . - Mmm-hmm . Well , so what 're you gonna do now ? Gonna rip off your new sis and abscond with Kira ? She 's not my sister and , yeah , that 's exactly what we do . - Well ... - ( DOOR LOCK CLICKING OPEN ) - Shit . - ( WHISPERS ) Hide ! You cannot hide in minimalist furniture ! Go . Shit . ( STUTTERING ) You 're not supposed to be here . Nice . ( STUTTERING ) You were staying at Cody 's for a while . I think that 's a good idea . Well , I think you 're being a bitch . I 'm the bigger person here , I need a change of clothes . Uh , I ... I 've been reinstated , Paul . - Hey . - Oh . Well , how do you feel about that ? What ? Are you painting by numbers ? I guess I am . Okay , I 'm sorry I 'm like this , Paul . - Uh ... - You 're not like this , Beth , it 's your job . Yeah , but I 'm a cop first , Paul , but ... Shit . How would you like it if I start pulling this schizophrenic hot-and-cold crap on you ? Maybe you should , Paul . I mean , seriously , where are we going with this ? ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( MOANING ) ( INAUDIBLE ) Sorry . Gotta go . Oh , my God ! ( GASPS ) Oh ! She doesn 't want to break up with big-dick Paul . ( GRUNTS ) She smells it in her musk . You are stuffed . - ( CHUCKLES ) - Oh , holy shit . Oh , don 't worry , I bet he 's wanking already . Oh , he 'd better be . ( MOANS ) Paul will so be . - No , no , no , no . - No . ( GRUNTS ) Eye on the prize , okay . Get the money back from Beth 's other partner . - Get out . - Yeah . ( BUZZER SOUNDS ) Maybe it 's a lady grip Walther . You like your big Glock , don 't you ? ( CHUCKLES ) So , um , two sets of tire tracks at the crime scene ? One motorcycle and one car ? Yeah , but there had to be three people there . So , if the killer 's on a motorcycle , then what ? He has an accomplice , drives the vic to the quarry ? Or the vic has a driver , doesn 't go to police , panics , and half-ass buries the body ? Yeah , the , um , body dump doesn 't match the professional hit . Exactly . And I got something else for you , Beth , you 're gonna love this . That was in the sniper 's nest . Yeah . We got a live one . Phone calls , leaving clues , messing with us . - ( CELL PHONE RINGS ) - MAN : Resetting ! Weapons down , please ! Detective Childs . All right , yeah , Suzuki ? Okay , hang on a sec . MAN : All clear ! - Okay , thanks . - ( BUZZER SOUNDING ) Patrol 's spotted my stolen Suzuki down at Parkdale . It 's a long shot . We may as well see if the tires match . ( GUNSHOTS ) ART : Is this the stolen sport bike ? Yeah , it looks like it . Well , let 's find the super . My son ? My son ? Yeah , I ... I know , he 's not home , but , um , the motorcycle , does it belong to a renter ? Upstair ? My son no here . No . No . Thank you . Thought you were the one supposed to deal with the non-English speaking majority . Uh , yeah , my Ukrainian sucks . Easy access . ( SOFTLY ) Motorcycle clothes . ( KNOCKS ON DOOR ) It 's open . What you got there ? Uh ... " You formed my inward parts , " You knitted me together in my ... " - BOTH : " ... mother 's womb . " I praise you for I am fearfully and wonderfully made . " Bibles , dolls . This perp 's got some deep-seated spiritual problems . ( sun FIRING ) ( GROANING ) ( INDISTINCT ) Go ! - No . No . - I 'm okay . Go ! Go after him ! Go ! ( WHIMPERS ) Shit . Freeze ! Police ! Shit . ( PANTING ) ( WHIMPERING ) Shots fired ! 780 Bane . Bane and Heward . Foot pursuit in progress . ( CELL PHONE DIALING ) ( RINGING ) Art . - Where are you ? Uh , I think he went west , uh , between the two , uh , the row houses . Uh , I think he went into one of the abandoned buildings here . ( GROANS ) Beth ! Beth ! No ! ( WHIMPERING ) IN RUSSIAN ACCENT : Good riddance . Elizabeth Childs . I 'm not Beth ! ( GASPS ) Dirty little copy cop . Who are you ? - ( GRUNTS ) - ( GROANS ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Not yet . Not Beth . ART : Beth ! Beth ! Jesus Christ ! Are you okay ? Hey . I 'm fine . I 'm fine . Where 'd he go ? Okay . Okay , I 901 You - I got you , come on . All I saw was a hoodie . He hit me from behind . And you struggled with him at close quarters ? Yeah , I was almost out , I never saw his face . Lieutenant . I almost lost not one but two detectives . How the hell are you in this without backup , Art ? It was a thread , Lieutenant . It was a flimsy lead on a stolen bike . Well , it sure hit . - You sure you 're all right ? - I 'm fine . Just let me take her home . I never should have told you to go after him . Of course I 'm gonna go after him , Art . It 's not your fault . No , no , I should have had your back . ( sums ) You had mine . I didn 't have yours . Yes , you did . Look , shit happens fast , okay ? Will you please ... I 'm not gonna let you drive me home like an invalid , okay ? I just need a shower and an early start so we can catch this guy . - Okay ? - Hey . ( RUSTLING ) Your money 's all there . You did have it in the trunk . Sorry I held it over you . Guess I owe you one . No , we 're square . Hey , you 're not gonna hug me , are you ? See you in the morning . ( CAR DOOR CLOSES ) ( CAR ENGINE STARTS ) Are you sure about this ? ( ( SIGHS ) - ls ) Yeah . ( SIGHS ) Bloody Mrs. S. She 's right . Really ? What kind of mother am I if I snatch my own daughter ? A crap one . I agree . And if I rob Alison ? - Run now and never tell my ... - Clones ? Oh , God , we do have to find another word for that . Don 't tell them what , Sarah ? What happened ? After all this ? Really gonna go and just give the money back to bitchface ? Mrs. S gave me one visit . I need to get it right . Okay . ( SIGHS ) Well , this has taken years off my life . Now can you please tell me what in the hell happened to your face ? ( LAUGHS ) ( GROANING ) Detective Childs . WOMAN IN RUSSIAN ACCENT : No , you 're not . Can you tell me what the angry angel looked like ? COSIMA : Beth probably shot Maggie Chen on purpose . She never told us anything about this . PAUL ' . We need to spend some time together . Figure out what 's suddenly going on with us . Sarah needs your help with her daughter . You 're not my mother . WOMAN IN RUSSIAN ACCENT : It 's not about revenge . SARAH " . She was here . She was Beth . She 's gonna get us both busted unless ! meet her . Alone .

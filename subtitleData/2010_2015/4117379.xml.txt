 Removing me from office was your objective upon arrival . I won 't make it easy for you . This is Alchemist to CT10 . Our birth rate has plummeted in the last year . It 's still falling . Women are not becoming pregnant and we need to do something . If the ACs are out there , we need to know , what do they want ? And some day we will walk into that place and have our revenge . If we don 't hit ' em hard , we 're gonna have a guerrilla army on our back the whole time . Well , that 's the thing with guerrilla wars - you hit them , they hit you back . Stella , my children are here , and I 'm not going crazy . - We do not need worthless stones . - This planet doesn 't want us . We didn 't kill your children , but something else did . How do you know it 's not still here , watching you ? This section 's clear , sir . Hold the line , stay together ! You there , at the back , come on , keep up ! 'The search continues 'for the three Expeditionaries who 've been lost now for two days , 'and , whilst not famous for my pro-military views , ' I 'm gonna dedicate this song to the three missing defenders of our city . To Brian Docherty , Clark Johnson and Josie Hunter . 'Still no sign of Hunter , Johnson or Docherty , sir . 'Red Watch also report nothing in sector eight . ' Brian will be fine . They 've probably just got lost in the hills somewhere . Mm . This was going to be his last mission before the baby . He 's very proud of us . You don 't exactly see many pregnant women round here , do you ? Well , that is because we keep them all locked up . Richard , this is Marie Docherty . Ah , Marie . We 're doing everything we can to find Brian . Meanwhile , if there 's anything we can do to support you ... Excuse us a moment . Er , Mr President ... is Brian coming back ? Of course he is . They all are . They 've been missing for over two days now . - No signal , no flare , no sightings . - Why didn 't Jack tell us before now ? Jack 's being his usual cooperative self , refusing to tell us what went wrong , why they were there , what zone they were even in . It 's like some private Expeditionary issue . Three dead XPs would be very much my issue . We have found out that their short-wave radio was operating at 7.23 megahertz . We 've tuned in , hoping that our receivers are more powerful than Jack 's . - And ? - Dead silence . Through here , please . - Who are they ? - They 're Josie Hunter 's kids . - She led the expedition . - I know her . I gave her a bravery award about five years ago . She saved some drunken teenager from electrocuting himself . She 'd given birth about three weeks beforehand , to Dylan . I remember . She 's brought up those three kids on her own . One of our rare jewels . We have to get them back . Stop dreaming of a life you 'll never lead . Clearly never met my inner millionaire . - Still no news on the XPs ? - Soldier boy still refused their help ? - Sky 's still blue . - Hm ! Get in ! Hey , see that ? Quick . 'Sir , we have a distress flare in the third zone . ' I think it 's Docherty . - All right , get there now . - Yes , sir . Come on , let 's go . My name 's Stella . I just wanted to let you know about your mum . Is she dead ? No , no . She 's not dead . We just don 't know where she is . But then you don 't know she 's not dead . No , I don 't . So don 't tell us things that aren 't true . Point taken , OK . I promise you that I will tell you the truth from now on , OK ? Mum told us that if she died , Stacy will look after us , and it would all be OK . This is zone three . 'We 've got nothing here . ' How can there be a distress flare and no-one in distress ? Do you need help ? With respect , sir , it 's my responsibility . I 'm dealing with it . - Why were they out there ? - Standard operation . So why did it take you 48 hours to report their disappearance ? I thought they 'd gone AWOL . It happens . And you 've no idea where they are ? They 'll be following operational procedures . They 'll be fine . I 'm sure they will . But those XPs are citizens of a community for which I 'm responsible . That makes it both our problem . 'Base , come in . ' This is Hartson . 'Josie Hunter 's flare 's just gone off in zone seven . ' That makes no sense . - Check the ID of the flare . - It was Josie Hunter 's flare . They 're not meant to be anywhere near that zone . - We 're headed there now . - I 'm gonna meet you there . Come on , people , let 's go . - Let me give you some support . - Why do I think I know what that means ? Here 's one for you . Two flares on opposite sides of the perimeter . No sign of ' em in either place . Anyone ? No , come on , don 't be shy . Thought not . It might help if you told us what they was doing out here . - It wouldn 't help . - You see , I 'm trying to remember which one of us has accidentally mislaid three of their team ... - Not now , Cass . - and spent nearly two days hiding it from the rest of us out of sheer bloody pride . - Yeah ? - ' Got some good news for you , boss . ' Bring some water , quick ! Josie ! Josie ! Lieutenant Josie Hunter reporting to my commanding officer . Welcome home . Are you saying , Josie , you were attacked by ACs ? Yes , sir . I was ... back left of the chevron , saw them coming down the slopes , tried to ... to warn the others . I shouted to Brian , he was at point . He got cut off . Clark and I doubled back . I was faster . Clarkey 's not the fittest . I ... I made it out of the valley but I got attacked by an AC as I was rounding the spur west-southwest . He cut my arm with a flint blade . I sliced him and shot him dead . There were two others onto me so I had to cut east across the desert . Walked in a semicircle for two days to get home . Can I see my kids ? You did good not to reveal the true nature of the operation . No problem , sir . Those bastards are gonna pay for this . - Mum ! Mum ! - Mum ! Mum ! I 'll go and make sure they 're OK . I need to speak to you , Jack . My office . - Here we go . - Mm-hm . She 's six centimetres dilated and her heart rate 's not right . We 've tried EBC , but it 's still breech . Prepare theatre just in case . Don 't worry , Marie . Don 't worry , we do this all the time . - Give that back , Dylan ! - Give what back ? That was quite a reception . You must have really touched people . I , er ... I just want to be with my children now . Of course . I 'll ... I 'll tell them to give you some space . - You want some coffee , Mum ? - I 'll have some water . - Your children were amazing . - Yeah . They 've had to be . You all right , Mum ? Yeah . Come and give me a hug . - You OK , Josie ? - Just tired . Get some sleep , Mum . Yeah , I think I will . - Mummy never sleeps in the day . - Well , today wasn 't an ordinary day . They want to cut it out , but I 'm holding on for the big push . You do it the way you want to , OK ? Oh ! - Why are you here ? - What do you mean ? You 're the head of PAS , you don 't attend births , - unless ... - What ? Well , ever since I got pregnant , I 've had this feeling that this baby isn 't just mine . It 's like she 's the future of Carpathia . For God 's sake , don 't call her Carpathia . Brian would never forgive you . She 's not Carpathia . She 's yours and Brian 's . She just means a great deal to us , OK ? - I need your assurance . - You can 't do this ! I need your assurance no reprisals will be taken against the ACs . They may have killed two of my men ! I have every right to take whatever measures I think necessary ... Until we find out what happened out there , you will do nothing . Find the missing men , dead or alive . Be sure of your evidence , then come back to me . And I want Cass with you at all times . I don 't need some head prefect looking over my shoulder . You don 't have a choice . Look on the bright side . I might give you a gold star . Try to be tactful , Cassius . It 's tough being responsible for the loss of your men . He 's never been responsible for anything in his life . - How 's Josie ? - Tired . Two days without water . She 's a tough soldier . Marie Docherty 's gone into labour . And what do the doctors say ? The baby 's in breech position , but healthy . Marie 's blood pressure 's very high , so they 've put her on an NT feed . They 're hoping she 'll stabilise . To think that this baby could be the last on Carpathia . It has to happen like this . Does she even know how special she is ? She 's noticed the lack of other mothers-to-be . I 'm trying to keep it from her . I think she could do without the pressure . Good . We need this baby to survive . Mum ? Stacy wants to know if you want to eat with us . - I 'd like that very much . - OK . - Mum 's weird . - So what ? You 're always weird ! Radio contact to be maintained at all times and shoot on sight any assailant or intruder . - Hang about . - This is my operation . Yeah , operation , not war . We 're finding your men , Jack , not avenging them . We made your favourite . Thanks . Aren 't you going to do it ? Do what ? The vow of thanks . The vow of thanks , yes . Yes , of course . Stacy , you do it . I 'm ... Thank the bloody stars we 're all here and all safe . Now let 's go out and live life to the full , without fear and without hate . And never , ever forget that our family will always be with us , love and support us , no matter what . What happened out there , Mum ? Nothing . Come on , guys . We 've got to spread out . Keep looking . Help ! - Help ! - Clark ? - Help ! - Clark ! Come on , you lot ! Come on , guys ! Get over here now ! - Clark Johnson is alive . - I ... It 's all right , mate . Don 't worry , don 't speak . We know what happened . It 's OK . How do you know ? Josie Hunter told us - about the AC attack , about what happened to all of you . Don 't you worry about it . We 're going to deal with it , all right ? - There were no ACs . - What do you mean ? Josie attacked us . She tried to kill us both . So what shall we do tomorrow ? Dylan ? Josie , I need you to come with me . Why ? Just come with us . We don 't want to involve them . - We need to talk to you about the attempted murder of Clark Johnson . - What ? Josie , please . Let 's go . What are you doing ? Get off her ! Get off her ! Mum ! Leave her alone ! Mum ! Mum ! Mum ! Mum ! Leave her alone ! Let 's go . Come on , get her out of here ! Leave her alone ! Mum ! Mr Johnson ? Thought I 'd come by and see how you are . I 've been better . No-one blames you for the failure of your mission . What mission ? Don 't worry . I know all about Jack 's black op ... to attack the ACs . I 'm not allowed to say . Why not ? It appears Lieutenant Hunter is a bit of a heroine . No-one wants to know the truth . I do . She killed Brian Docherty . Why ? I don 't know . We were heading up the valley as planned . She just suddenly ... went crazy . Kept saying that she wanted to go home to her children and ... Brian told her to stop being stupid and ... she took Brian 's throat and she just ... Why are we not allowed to know about this ? I know how angry you feel about what we 've discovered . But now is not the time to act rashly . We 're outnumbered - we must be precise and ruthless in our revenge . I 've asked two of our bravest men to undertake this mission . They will eliminate the XP leader and deal a fatal blow to Forthaven . You 've heard the accusation against you ? We 've done tests on the cut on your arm - it wasn 't a flint that made that , it was your own knife . Did you cut yourself to make it seem like you were attacked ? Listen , Josie , you have to tell us what happened out there . - I want to see my children . - Well , you can 't . Not until you give us some answers . Where 's Brian Docherty ? I want to see my children . Listen to me , Marie Docherty is currently eight centimetres dilated and about to have her first child . If her husband is out in the desert somewhere bleeding to death and you are stonewalling me ... Josie . You 've lived a life of immense pressure . Three children , a job with huge responsibilities , all this on a new planet . You 've kept all this to yourself for a long time , and now it 's time to talk to us . I want to see my children . - Who knows about this ? - Just Jack and his men . Tell them to keep quiet about it . I want this embargoed from everyone until we find out exactly what 's going on out there . Do you think she did it ? Makes no sense . Why would she ? Unless she just snapped . Look at her profile . Intense family issues , crazy workload , personal loss , long-term emotional stress . You 've just described most of the women in Carpathia , including this one . - I think we could all do with a beer . - Amen to that . I 'm sorry , I 'd love to , but I 'm afraid I have some intense family issues to deal with . Yeah , all right , I get the point . Can we move on ? No , seriously , I 'd love to , but Marie Docherty 's gone into labour , I need to be there . - A new baby in Forthaven . - It 's been a while . - Is she OK ? - No , she 's terrified . Husband 's missing , it 's a complicated birth - I might be some time . Stella Isen - pioneer , neurologist ... midwife . - Good luck . - Thank you . Just you and me , then , babe . It 's just a drink . - That 's all I want . - That 's all I 'm offering . - Good . - Good . This is Stella Isen , who is this ? Brian , is that you ? 'Can anyone hear me ? I 've just been attacked . ' Who is this ? 'It 's ... it 's Lieutenant Josie Hunter . ' Where are you ? Tell me where you are . 'I 'm west , seven miles west of the escarpment . ' - ' I can 't ... I can 't ... ' - Are you there ? Are you there ? Richard , something 's just happened . I 've just heard Josie on the radio . It was her voice . She said she was outside the city , she gave me coordinates , I saw the light flicker on the radio , - it was like it was absolutely real . - How do you know it wasn 't ? Because Josie Hunter is currently sitting under guard in a PAS cell not 20 yards from my office . I just checked . Did you record the radio message ? No , it happened too fast . I must 've been imagining it . Doesn 't sound like you . I don 't know what is like me any more . Thanks . There 's something about Josie 's family . It 's what you couldn 't create , what neither of us could a truly bonded unit . It 's like they 're a clan , like they 'd man the walls and die , sword in hand , defending each other . You chose a different path - not better , not worse . They make me feel like I have nothing . Although that doesn 't mean what you heard on the radio was an illusion . What else was it , then ? I don 't know . Just as I don 't know why my children were playing chess in my front room when they died nine years ago . Are you saying that Josie Hunter might be in two places at once ? Or that this Josie isn 't Josie ? I don 't think either Stella or I know what we 're saying - just go out there , check it out . And be careful . Please , we don 't have much time . Human beings have always hallucinated . UFO sightings on Earth , religious apparitions - it 's a sign of a society under pressure . - Do you think that 's what this is ? What else could it be ? I 'm going to go and check on Marie Docherty that is something we can control . Do you remember me ? I don 't want to talk to you . Please . I 'm here to help your mother . - Where are the others ? - Asleep . - I 'd like you to wake them . Now . - Not till I know what 's going on . How did your mother seem when she got back ? Normal or not ? Well , she had been walking in the desert for two days with a cut in her arm , so ... But she didn 't seem herself , did she ? Maybe not . That 's cos she 's not Mum . - Dylan , go back to bed . - What did you say ? He keeps banging on about it . - That 's cos she 's not . - Not your mother ? He says it looks like her but it 's not her . I want you all to come with me - now . No luck ? I don 't think he could be anywhere out there - dead or dying . I 've been trying to find Stella Isen to get some answers . To what ? Why would Josie Hunter attack her own men ? I mean , you chose her for this mission because she 's your most reliable officer . Yeah , well , I 've been thinking about that for the last 12 hours . Well , as a result of what happened , the mission I asked you to undertake ... is still incomplete . And that 's ... disappointing , Jack . Yeah , well , I can 't think about that right now . Well , um , you should . If you and I are going to correct the mistakes being made by the current leadership , we need to make our move soon . Now , I want to know that you 're right beside me , against Tate and his people , the whole of PAS . - And Stella Isen ? - Stella 's a unique case . She may well prove to be our greatest enemy or she may be our greatest friend . Whatever happens , I need to know that we 're 100 % together . Ah ... Ever looked for someone who isn 't missing before ? This is where Stella said she radioed from . Josie ! Josie ! Josie , can you hear me ? Josie ! Josie ! Cass ! - Where are we going ? - To see your mother . - Why ? - We need to ask her some questions . What happened ? - What about Josie ? - Josie Hunter 's not here . She 's in a PAS holding cell , tucking into some perfectly decent prison grub . That blackout is real . We need to be there to help out . The electrical plant 's gone down . I 'm calling a state of emergency . Let 's contact all Council members . You need to see this . The power to the locking system failed . Where 's Mum ? Your mum 's fine . I 'll just get someone to take you home , OK ? We can look after ourselves . Yeah , I know that , but I 'd just rather someone took you home . I don 't want anyone knowing about this until we find her . No . The entire city is without electricity . What emergency backup do we have ? Key installations - government buildings , emergency wards - they 've all got their own generators . - What 's the cause ? Unknown . I 've authorised a level two lockdown , with special powers granted to Stella 's and Jack 's forces to keep the peace . Right , so we 're going to need volunteers to help with the older citizens - and the sick . - We 're already on it . Then let 's not waste any more time . I heard Josie Hunter 's been arrested . - Yes . - Why ? It appears the attack on the XPs was self-inflicted , not caused by any AC involvement . We 're still investigating the incident . Any more than that , I can 't tell you now . - Stella , wait . - Not now , Julius . Stacy ... Rona ... Dylan ... I 'm coming . - What 's happened to the lights ? - We 're finding out . You 're leading this side of the city 's patrol . Coordinate with Jack . We didn 't find Josie . Well , I must have been hearing things , then . You reckon ? Yes . Thanks , anyway . Marie ? Marie ? 'When the power was cut , the NT tube constricted , and she went into shock . ' They need to do a Caesarean or the baby will die , but they 're not sure whether Marie 's strong enough to survive it . You mean , do we save the baby or the mother ? Well , we have a political crisis unfolding . - I have to stay here . - I 'll go back . The decision needs to be made . Sorry to interrupt such vital work , girls , but it appears we 're in a state of emergency . Power cut 's your job , mate . I 've just done a 12-hour shift looking for a dead soldier . Orders are for PAS and you guys to divide the town . You look after east , and we 'll take the west . - Tate 's orders ? - We just can 't do it without you , mate . Yeah , well , at least let me finish my hand first . I 'm just about to become a very rich man . Well , you know what they say about rich men , don 't you ? Always got to watch your back . Your 20 ... I 'll raise you 20 . Trouble with you is you bluff every bloody time . Takes all the skill out of the game . This pile says not , my friend . You seeing me or not ? Got to see straight in the gloom . I don 't know why we let you bastards live . Get up ! Put this dog in the cage ! Two ACs - one dead , the other we 've arrested . They shot one XP . They caused the power cut to get into the XP headquarters . An act of terror inside Forthaven . Jack 's spreading the news as fast as he can . There 's no containing it . - Where 's Stella ? - With Marie Docherty . Bring her here , Fleur . Josie Hunter 's escaped . Find her . We need to show we 're in control of this . Sure . Hello ? Josie ? Josie ? No luck ? The house was empty . - All their coats had gone . - Where has she taken them ? - If she hurts them , - I 'm not sure what will happen here . Sir ? You need to see this . It 's Docherty . Poor bastard . - Can I use your prayer room ? - Of course . Just through there . - We just found Docherty 's body . - What ? I want to see Josie Hunter . Josie 's escaped and taken her kids with her . Jack , this is more complicated than ... I think my thick , squaddie brain has got a handle on it . Then you 're wrong . I just heard . I had no idea this was going on . I 'm so sorry . Please , Julius , I need to be alone . Of course . Religion has nothing to teach us in a decision like yours . There 's no right , there 's no wrong . Well ... I 'll leave you alone . Julius ... if they don 't operate , the baby will definitely die inside her . And if they do , the baby will live , but Marie 's life ... Is in greater hands . They 're about to perform the Caesarean . So ... the baby will live . Marie 's chances of survival ? Less than 50 % . You made the best decision you could , the one you believed in . Why did you come here , Richard ? They found Brian . - This is getting out of control , Cass . - Let 's just find Josie Hunter . It 's her ! Put your weapons on the ground ! - Please ... - Get down . Get down , Josie ! Get down , Josie ! Now ! Lie down now ! Cuff her . I just ... I need to see my children . I just ... I just want to see my children . What are you doing here ? Offering counsel to Stella . I hear Josie Hunter escaped . Why was no-one told about this ? Wait ... don 't tell me . You can 't say . Not to you . Well , thankfully , XPs have found her . She 's back in detention now . - Where is she ? - In a cell with the captured AC . She 's not going anywhere this time . You do realise her children are still missing ? I pray you 're not about to add their lives to your casualty list of indecision . Is everything OK ? I heard you saved a life tonight . And possibly lost one . A decision had to be made . I respect you for making it . I 've no idea what you 're talking about . Your colleague , Clark Johnson , says you attacked him and Brian Docherty . I was attacked - look at me . What , by the ACs ? No , it was something else . It was ... I ... I went to ... to find water . I was standing , I saw a shadow behind me , I turned round , there was a blinding light in my eyes , and I was pushed back down a ravine and smashed my leg . Do you really expect me to believe that ? I just ... I just lay there . And then I ... then I heard two voices - a man 's and a woman 's . They were looking for me . There was no-one there looking for you . There was no-one there looking for you , because you was here . They were . They were ... they were calling for me , and I ... I couldn 't answer them cos I was too tired . Then how did you magically make it back , then ? Because my children needed me . You 're lying . You 're no better than that AC dog behind you . You know , if you hadn 't sent me on that mission , - this would never have happened ... - What mission ? Assassination . Who ? Leader of the ACs . Rudi ? Yes . - And she agreed to kill him ? - She didn 't agree to anything . She obeyed orders . She also said that she could hear us looking for her in the mountains . How is that possible ? She was in our cells . That woman is telling the truth . I 'm sure of it . And the other one , the one who we cheered back into our city , who 's that , then ? Well , if it 's all right by you , I 'm assuming we all dreamt her up out of grief and anxiety . Anything other than that does my head in . Just find her children . And , Cass , take Josie with you . How am I going to do that ? She 's under court martial in an Expeditionary cage . Jack 's not letting her go anywhere . Hello , boys . Full house . Nice . How 's the dog and his bitch ? Woo-woo-woo ! Give me your gun . Let her out . And when I 'm gone , give him some water . He 's not the animal - you are . - Put this on . - Where are we going ? To find your family . Why aren 't you taking me home ? Because they 're not there - someone 's taken them . - Who 's taken them ? - I can 't explain that right now . Just listen to me and I promise ... Jesus , how long have they been missing ? ! Josie , I need you to stay calm . Now , if you wanted to take them somewhere , somewhere really special , somewhere they 'd always want to go to ... Josie , just think . Um , there 's ... Jellybale Rocks , on a mountain , just outside town ... I take them every year for my birthday . There 's a ... there 's a ... there 's a place where you can have a picnic . - We camp the night . - Take me . We 're losing her ! It 's just up here . It 's not far . The kids love it here . They love sleeping between the rocks . - How 's the leg ? - I can barely feel it . - That 's adrenalin for you . - That 's mother 's love , mate . Would you have killed Rudi , as Jack ordered ? My job is to defend the city . Someone else can decide what 's right and wrong . This is it ! Stacy ! Rona ! Dylan ! - Stacy ! - Rona ! - Dylan ! - Hello ! Stacy ! Shit . What are you not telling me ? Another you came down from the hills . What are you talking about ? She looked like you . Spoke like you , you know ? We ... we thought it was you . And the kids ... did they think she was me ? I don 't know . Dylan ! Stacy ! If they 're up in the rocks , they might not hear us down here . Rona ! Stacy ! - Stacy ! - Ssh , ssh ! Stacy ? Stacy , it 's Mum . Dylan ! It 's really your mum . We ... we ran away from you . That wasn 't me , my love . You ... you wanted to know why we loved you , what love was . Doesn 't sound much like me , does it , eh ? How about the other urchins ? Are they OK ? - It 's OK . It 's ... it 's me , it 's all right . - Mum ? Who is she ? This is your mum . How do you know ? Stacy Jessie Hunter ... how thick are you ? Can 't you bloody tell ? Get away from the children ! Jack ! No ! Get away from them or I 'll shoot . - Don 't you touch her ! - Leave her alone ! Jack , you 've got no idea what 's going on here . I 've got a very good idea , mate . Just stay where you are , kids . - Get away from her ! - No , Jack . Move . Jack , just listen to me . Put the gun down . - Get out of the way , Cass . - Look , you 've got it all wrong . - She killed Docherty ! - No , she didn 't . Who did , then ? She did . That 's her . - That 's the one who took us . - Yeah . Which one 's the real one ? This one . This is Mum . - How do you know ? - I just do , stupid . There were two of them ... She was there ... Let 's just keep it between ourselves ... shall we ? I 'm sorry , Marie . I 'm so sorry . You sure ? We all saw it . Two women ... identical . - One was real ... - Cass ... the other you imagined . Yeah . The other we imagined . Good night , Cass . And thank you . Mr President , may I have a word ? Of course . Last night 's attack ... almost cost us the life of a new Carpathian child . Now , your Utopian ideal of a world without conflict , - it 's rapidly becoming a pipe dream . - I don 't accept that . The ACs are a threat to our very survival here . They must be dealt with without mercy . I thought that once - I was wrong . They were never meant to exist . And who was meant to ? Were you , Julius ? Were any of us really meant to exist ? If I 'm to continue to serve you , as I dearly wish to do , - you need to move with me on this . - Or ? I would much rather there was no " or " . Julius , how much do you know about Jack 's secret operation ? What operation ? To send Josie Hunter and her men to assassinate the AC leader . That isn 't what I came to talk about . No , I don 't suppose it is . I 'm so sorry you chose this path . This is Alchemist . I 'm confirming the takeover operation . 'I have the Head of the Expeditionaries on my side . 'I am fully confident that the leader of Protection and Security will also join us . ' We will be ready for you . And God said , " Let there be light . " Drinking your worries away ? How 's Marie ? Mother and child are doing fine . Do you believe it , Richard ? Do you believe there were two Josie Hunters ? Well , Cass was persuading Jake of your mass hallucination theory . - He wants to believe it himself . - So do I. - That wasn 't a hallucination , Stella . - What was she , then ? The fossils you discovered were hominid . - A species that evolved ... - And is now extinct . What if something destroyed them ? I don 't think we 're alone here . That 's not rationally possible . No , it 's not . Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd E-mail subtitling @ bbc.co.uk

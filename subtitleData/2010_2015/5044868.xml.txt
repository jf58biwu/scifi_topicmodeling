 Previously on " Warehouse 13 " ... Thank you for remembering our appointment . Artie ! How could you possibly have survived ? The Phoenix ? Harriet Tubman 's thimble . It was me ? - Mrs. Frederic , it was me . - The worst case of identity theft ever . It 's not her fault . James ? James ! I 'm sorry , Arthur . Hi . That 's a great color on you , ma 'am . Hello . You 're never gonna win these people over . They will succumb to my charms , Myka . They will succumb . Hi . Hello ! - What ? Whatever ! - Come on . - Come on ! - Call me . It 's just bull ! Joy . Is it Tuesday again already ? Uh , yes . Kiss , kiss to you , Brenda . You got our stuff or what ? Finally ! It only took six months . Shipped in from D.C. this morning . What , are you taking deliveries from the mob ? M.O.B. , Einstein . Myka O. Bering ? What 's the " O " for ? Olive ? Olive oil ? Olive Garden ? - So not telling you . - Whatever . Wait , hey , hey , B , B ! - What about my stuff ? - Sorry , slick . That 's it . - What ... - If you don 't mind ... I 'm watching a movie , and I don 't have the Tivo . It 's my books , my music , ... my fuzzy slippers . Yay ! Yay . Let me get you some salt . Sorry . They sit there , Arthur , and they hoard the things - that can save the world . - You 've had your chance , Arthur . - So many chances ! - Almost everything . You always hurt the one you love . - Arthur ? - Artie ? - Hey , you okay ? - Yeah . I 'm fine . You sure ? ' Cause for a second there , you seemed untethered . Weren 't you supposed to be helping , Leena install the rest of the new motion detectors ? - Getting to it . - Getting to it ? Claudia ... If the Warehouse is vulnerable , ... then we are vulnerable . And we are not going to be vulnerable ever again . And there are other threats out there . Who , H.G. Wells ? Sister friend kind of did us a favor by killing ... Killing ... Does no one a favor . That 's why we have Teslas , not bullets . That 's why ethics are codified in the ... Saved by the beep . Looks like we got a ping . You want me to rally the troops ? No , what I ... What I want is for you ... to help Leena install the rest of the new motion detectors . Aye aye , Captain Bligh . Yeah ... Hello , Motor City . DETROIT , MICHIGAN Now , that 's something I never expected to see . Yep , yep , yep . She must have found an artifact that makes her act like a girl . Her aura ... - It 's just so ... - Happy ? These things hold special memories for me . You know ? It makes me feel like I 'm , ... home . We interrupt this concert ... to bring you your regularly scheduled job . All right , first this mugger is delivered to Detroit Metro police , ... and he 's in a twisted streetlight . Look at that . He 's in a coma . And then this drug dealer ... he is found dangling from this flagpole ... pretty high up too . He 's in a coma as well . And by the time it takes to print these photos , our mysterious assailant strikes again . A person did this ? With what ? If I knew that , I wouldn 't be sending you both to Detroit . Plane 's in an hour . Skedaddle . Yeah , listen , I know things are awkward between you and Claudia , but I need you working together and over it . - Don 't talk to me . Talk ... - Just get it done . DETROIT , MICHIGAN Now , that is a big hole . So , officer Kessman , according to the reports , you were the first on scene at all three incidents ? Yes , ma 'am . I was out walking my beat , and I hear three shots fired , followed by a loud crash . And that 's when I look up , and I see the hole . - But not what caused - No , ma 'am . Fortunately , the occupants are out of town , so the only casualty 's the perp . Okay , well , thank you . We 'll take it from here . Yeah . Three shots fired ... No blood ... No bullet holes . Hey , Mykes . Check these out . - Bullets . - Yesiree , Bob . At least they used to be . Investigators didn 't find these ? Investigators ? With all the recent cutbacks , we 're lucky we still have guns . - Welcome to my world . - Kevlar ? No way a vest would flatten a slug that much that 's just freaky . Welcome to our world . Yeah . Hello ? Claudia . Hey , Claudia ! - Claudia ... - Jeez ! Jeez , Leena . Skulk much ? Artie wants us to finish putting these sensors up . Well , I 'm doing this instead . Okay , ... look , do you want to just get it off your chest right now ? My chest is burden-less . Can 't you tell by reading my aura ? I don 't have to read your aura ... to know that you 're pissed off at me . Going back to work now . Neighborhood watch meets here once a week . Might be because Loretta organized the group , and she makes the best pies in the Midwest . Pete , he said pie . I know . I just want to make sure everything 's Jake on the home front first . I 'll be right there . Thank you . Look , all 's I 'm saying is you want to make an omelet , you got to crack a few skulls . And I 'm saying there are other ways to keep this neighborhood safe than vigilantism . Right , Sheldon ? I 've read that there are two types of criminals ... parasites and cowards . Amen , brother . Like that . Boom . What ? Look , cranky 's kind of your natural state of being , isn 't it ? What , please ? Three squashed bullets . Okay ? We think the artifact has some kind of a bulletproof invulnerability . Yeah , no , that wouldn 't explain the hole in the wall . Well , what if whatever it is , it does a bunch of different stuff ? Doubtful . Okay . Well , maybe Claudia can do a little , you know , tippy-typy ... Look , Pete , could you just figure it out ? You 're a big kid now . All right ? I got to go . Okay , look , Artie , this is a little too crotchety , even for you . What 's going on ? I 'm sorry , it 's nothing . It 's just that I have a little ... rodent problem . I 'll have Claudia explore the invulnerability theory , all right ? Gracias . Hey . Detroit 's almost finest . Officer Kessman ... Large mochaccino and a slice of Pumpkin to go ? Not today , Loretta . This is Agent Bering , Secret Service . Hello . I 'm her partner , Agent Lattimer . Howdy . Is the President in town ? No , no , we 're just here on a local matter , and we could use the neighborhood watch 's help . The authorities need our help ? That 's not a good sign . - Yeah . - Well , I have to run to the bank . I 'll be right back , but you can talk to Sheldon . He works with the watch . Two slices of the lemon meringue for the Agents , please . Oh , you know what ? I 'm more of a ... Twizzlers gal myself , but thanks . But , I 'll take her slice . So what are you guys looking for ? Anything strange or unusual . Yes . You know , something that could twist a street lamp or ... Put a hole through a brick wall . You see anything like that that fits the bill ? No . Sorry . Haven 't seen anything . But I 'll definitely keep my eye out . Okay , then . If you don 't mind ... My city needs me . You know , Dudley Do-Right was first on the scene at all three locations . Yeah . He 's also P.O. ' d about the cutbacks , and he likes to do things his own way . Maybe he 's doing things his own way with an artifact . - We should probably ... - I think we should . I 'm gonna ... take these with me . Thank you so much . What do you think he 's got ? I don 't know . Wyatt Earp 's badge , maybe ? That 's a good theory , Olivia . Olga . Oprah . Hey . Game on . I 'm gonna go check out the bedroom . Hey , up there the window 's been broken . - Freeze , Dirty Harry ! - Surrender the artifact ! Artifact ? What are you talking about ? And what the hell is that thing ? What did you use to mop the floor with these guys ? - I didn 't do this . - Sure you didn 't . We got an anonymous tip , and I come run ... No freakin ' way ! Help me ! Please ! Okay , just put him down nice and slow . Who was that masked man ? That was no man . That was a superhero . ~ Warehouse 13 S02E02 ~ ~ Mild Mannered ~ - Pete , that was not a superhero . - No , that was the Iron Shadow . - The Iron Shadow ? - Yeah . Only the most " awesomest " character of the silver age . You grew up in a bookstore . How do you not know that ? Real books , not cartoons ! Yeah , comic books ! A guy in tights just leaped over a building . Yeah , best to omit that from your report . What report ? All right . Okay . That mask he was wearing looked kind of artifact-y . Maybe that 's where he 's getting those powers from . No , the Iron Shadow doesn 't have powers . He 's just a regular guy trained to be the ultimate urban Samurai . Okay , even ultimate urban Samurai can 't leap over buildings , okay ? Whoever that was has an artifact . We should have Claudia check the Warehouse database . No need . You 're looking at a one-man Iron Shadow encyclopedia . Pick an issue , any issue . I think we already know your issues , okay ? So officer Kessman said he got an anonymous tip , right ? I bet you dollars to doughnuts where that call came from . Doughnuts ... - or pies . - Best in the Midwest . See , now I want doughnuts . Since when does the Secret Service investigate petty crimes ? Just open the safe . Do you have any idea what this woman means to this community ? - Sheldon , it 's okay . - No , it 's not . You go after good citizens like Loretta ? I was robbed at gunpoint in my apartment . Bastards took my clothes , my computer , my collection , everything . We all feel unsafe . We just want somebody to do something about it . There ... knock yourselves out . What does this do ? It 's a key . It opens things . You , ... you may want to cover your eyes . Nothing . No , no . Nothing . Guess the Iron Shadow doesn 't use keys . Wait , the Iron Shadow ? - Yeah . - Like the comic book ? Yeah , yeah , there 's some guy running around town . - We 're very sorry . - Yeah . - Sorry to bother you . - Sorry . Sorry . - Thank you for your time . - Thank you . Hello , square one ... - We meet again . - Okay , okay . Let 's just think this through . Okay ? You 're Joe Shmoe . You find an artifact that gives you superpowers . What do you do ? I track down Ralph Brunsky and give him the mother of all atomic wedgies in front of the entire seventh-grade class . Or I don the guise of my all-time favorite superhero and use my powers - to fight crime . - Okay . Okay . So , ... where does a person ... like you ... hang out ? Yeah ! Okay . Artifact City . - No . Classic collectibles . - Potentially dangerous . You go talk to the owner . I 'm gonna do some research . Welcome to the Hairy Tarantula . How can I ... - Hey , I know you . - Agent Bering . Hi . What can I do you for ? Earlier today you were praising vigilantes . Are you aware that someone in town is dressing up s a superhero and taking the law into their own hands ? Finally , someone 's nutting up , showing the cops how it 's done . - Yeah , well , people are getting hurt . - Yeah , who ? Scum of the earth ? Boo-frakkin ' - hoo . Who 's this guy dressed up as , so I can order more of that ? Do you keep records of your customers ' purchases ? Yeah . I got a pull list . Why ? I 'm gonna need the names of anyone who 's ever bought Iron Shadow merchandise . - I like a woman who gives orders . - Just get me the list . Hey . - So is Brutus Beefcake our man ? - He wishes . Did you find anything ? I sure did . Issue 112 . " The government orders all superheroes to reveal their secret identities , but the Iron Shadow removes his mask for no man . - So the Feds send out ... " - I meant ... With our case . No . So what 's with the whole underwear on the outside thing ? - They 're called trunks . - Okay . I just ... never pegged you for such a ... what are they called ? Fanboys ? Yeah , well , my sister got me hooked on comics after my dad died . She thought it 'd be a good escape for me . I 've got every issue of The Legendary Iron Shadow except for number 46 , it 's my white whale . Of course , if my stuff never comes , I 'll have to rebuild my collection from scratch . It 'll come . " There 's only two types of criminals ... parasites ... and cowards . " Best mantra ever . Pete , I heard that today in the coffee shop . What ? Trade you for your phone number . No . Here . Sheldon said he lost his clothes , his computer , and his collection . Good work , chum . To the Batmobile . It 's just a rental . No , no , no . You 're not the one doing this . Not doing what , Arthur ? Artie . - Not doing what ? - Nothing . Nothing did anything . Artie , if there 's something wrong with the Warehouse , - you should tell us . - All right , enough . Enough . MacPherson . I saw him . MacPherson ? - Where ? - The first time ? - By the Escher Vault . - Shut up . So first , he blows up the Warehouse , then he dies in it , now he 's haunting it ? - Dude , go into the light already . - No , no , ghosts don 't exist . They 're just a manifestation of a temporal ... but the dead can rise again . God , that vampire meme is so aught-nine . Artie , are you sure this isn 't ... just a manifestation of your own guilt ? No , no , no . I have no guilt . I tried to save his life . He didn 't want to be saved . No , no , no , this ... This is something else . The accumulation of energy within the Warehouse combined with ... see if we have this . Combined with MacPherson 's psychic residue may have triggered ... an artifact in the vicinity of the Escher Vault that projected an apparition . Allons-y ! Rasputin 's prayer PE ? - Would you do the honors ? - Yeah . You think I 'm the Iron Shadow ? I work in a coffee shop . By day , maybe , but by night , you 're using a power that 's beyond your comprehension . And maybe even beyond your control . Look , I get it , man . Okay ? It makes you feel powerful . Like you 've just gone from a 98-pound weakling to a badass overnight . But every artifact has a downside , and people will get hurt . Yeah , the bad guys . Or somebody that you care about . Like Loretta . You stay away from her ! She doesn 't know anything about this . They attacked me . In my own home . You have no idea what that is like . Actually , we kind of do . Sheldon , please . Just give us the artifact . Okay . I guess I knew it was a bad idea . I 'll just , get it . It 's in there . Wow . - What the hell ? - Sheldon ! God , don 't superheroes ever use stairs ? Spidey sense tingling . Pete , just how powerful is this Iron Shadow ? You mean like in a fight with The Hulk , who would win ? Okay , sure . Well , The Hulk by a mile . Why ? Yeah . I will save this city ! I will make it safe for her . And no one is going to stop me ! - Oh , God . - This is your one warning ! Get out of my city ! Wow ! Wow ? This isn 't a comic book , Pete . I mean , did you see his hand tremors ? Neurological damage . Could be a side effect of molecular alteration . Okay , so Sheldon 's bulletproof one minute and then able to leap tall buildings in a single bound the next because ... - Because he 's altering his density . - With what ? So this is some kind of super gooer ? This scrubber ... mollifies psychically triggered artifacts ... by really getting down into those pesky , hard-to-reach pores . So that 's how Rasputin survived all those assassination attempts . Survived ? No , no , no . Nah , they got him the very first try . No , the Romanovs needed their enemies , the Bolsheviks , for example , to believe that the mad monk ... cheated death over and over again . So what they did was they resurrected Rasputin by using this prayer rope . It did not get rid of the Bolsheviks , - so the birth of Communism ... - I hate this course . Sorry . So anyway , a good scrubbing should get rid of MacPherson . Okay . Okay . This house ... is clean . James ? Do svidaniya . Ladies ... as you were . Okay . Of all the people you could have turned into , you picked me . I don 't know . I guess you were under some kind of weird spell or something , but I can 't help feeling betrayed , because I almost lost the only real family I 've ever had , because you decided to pick me . I didn 't pick you . Can 't you see what MacPherson has done ? He 's turned us all against each other . Artie ? Artie 's paranoid , and you 're suspicious . Without trust , we 're all vulnerable . And by the way , ... you 're not the only one who almost lost her family . Hey , Claud , I want to run a theory by you . You busy ? No . No . No , I 'm good to go . You can 't be rid of me that easily , Arthur . I will not let you win ! Gold star on the density altering . I ran it by grumpzilla . He pointed me to three items . Samson 's jawbone , Babe Ruth 's bat , and Bruce Lee 's punching bag . - But they 're all here in the Warehouse . - What about belts ? - Are there any belts ? - What ? Belts ? Why belts ? Well , the Iron Shadow 's belt is made of an indestructible metal that harnesses his chakra energy . Ding , ding , ding ! There is , in fact , a belt that alters density and gives the wearer super strength . - Well , do we have it ? - Alas , Jacob Kurtzberg 's belt is not currently in stock . - Jacob who ? - Kurtzberg . Aka , Jack " The King " Kirby . - He created ... - comic book stuff . Okay . Got it . So if Kirby 's belt is the artifact , how do we counter it ? Artie had me categorizing some old DARPA gak a couple weeks ago . Those guys were all about super-sizing soldiers during the cold war . I 'll dig in and holla back . Okay , so Sheldon is unstable and dangerous , plus he already considers us a threat . Which means we 're gonna have to play it by my book and not yours . So ... if I were Lex Luthor ... I would go after the Man of Steel 's greatest weakness , which is ... Kryptonite . No . Lois Lane . MASKED MAN PLAYS VIGILANTE Loretta . Sheldon . What are you doing here ? Are you okay ? - Do you feel safer now ? - You look terrible . Here , sit down . - Let me get you something . - You didn 't answer my question . I don 't understand . All I want is for you to feel safe . Sheldon ... I always feel safe with you . Really ? You do ? Yes . - I have to tell you something . - No , you don 't . I already know . I can see it ... in your eyes . I never could have hoped for someone like you , Loretta . Not who I was before , but now ... now things are different . What do you mean ? Different how ? It 's for you , Loretta . I 'm doing this for you . I 'm the Iron Shadow . Oh , my God . Sheldon ... Okay , shadow-man , hand it over ! - You two again . - Sheldon , we 're here to help you . I don 't need your help . Don 't you see the power I have ? Dude , you have no idea what you 're messing with ! No , ... you don 't ! Here we go again ! What 's happening ? Sheldon , you have to stop that ! I can 't ! Sheldon ? - Are you all right ? - No , Loretta , look out ! No ! I have to get out of here . - Pete . - Hey . - Is she okay ? - She 'll be fine . She just , ... She just lost it there for a second . Sheldon . Where ... - where 's Sheldon ? - I don 't know . - We need to shut him down , asap . - Please . - This isn 't his fault . He 's only doing this ... - for you . He 's in love with you . - Talk to me . - Good news ! I 've got just the gizmo to counter the Iron Shadow 's powers . Yeah , well , the bad news is you 're in South Dakota . Have no fear ... - Claudia 's here . - Nice . Cozy . Don 't fret . Artie said it was okay . Well , what he actually said was ... Go , go ! Plus , any excuse to get away from Leena . So what do you got ? This . Absorbs all forms of kinetic energy . A soldier takes 100 rounds to the chest per second and doesn 't break stride . Thinner than Kevlar , way more resilient . - What ? - And these puppies ... - What ? - A Claudia Donovan original . They channel the absorbed energy from the suit and allow the wearer to redirect it . Irresistible force ? Say Ni-hao to immovable object . I am gonna get to play a superhero in real life ! Awesome ! But there 's a kink . The suit 's energy-siphoning abilities drain the wearer of all vital fluids , causing paralysis in 60 minutes . Oh , I 'm only gonna need 60 seconds , 'cause I 'm gonna be all like ... And in men , it causes impotence . Here you go , Wonder Woman . - Artie ? - He won 't leave me alone . Why can 't I make him leave me alone ? It 's not guilt . It 's not artifacts . I really have no idea what the hell it is . Maybe you two aren 't finished with each other . Oh , please , I was finished with James MacPherson 15 years ago . You parted ways , but you weren 't finished . Artie , he was more than your ex-partner . He was your friend . You shared a connection stronger than most people share in their whole life . Death , we shared a death . I think that 's what it is . We shared a death . And we both rose from the ashes , ... and ... we were both brought back ... That 's what it is . We were both brought back . You think ? I think . That 's right . We were both brought back . We shared a death , and that 's what we have in common . If we don 't get that belt , those powers Sheldon has could kill him . And not just him . With those gravitational waves he 's pulling in , he could pancake an entire city block . That way . The factory . What ? What 's the factory ? Before Sheldon was laid off , he was an automotive engineer . He just goes there to think . Sheldon ! Is this how you want it ? All alone in your Fortress of Solitude ? We can help you . Help ? You already made me hurt Loretta ! I had everything under control ... until you showed up . This guy 's off the charts ! I know . We need to call out the big gun . Come on ! Myka ! What are you doing ? Sheldon ! You 're not the Iron Shadow ! And we 're not some sinister government agents trying to stop you . Okay ? We 're the good guys ! And we 're trying to help you , whether you want us to ... or not . No , I don 't want to hurt anyone else . Then take my hands . Pete , come get the belt ! - I got it ! - Myka ! Use the gauntlets ! Loretta ! Thank God you 're okay . I 'm so sorry . It 's okay . It 's over . - They got the belt . - Belt ? What are you talking about ? All right , that 's troubling . If it 's not the belt , what is it ? Help ! It 's starting again . I can 't get them off ! Holy underwear . It 's the trunks ! Loretta , you have to get out of here . I can 't control this anymore . I won 't leave you . - Loretta , come on ! - Sheldon ! We have to go ! Claudia ! - What 's happening ? - His mass keeps increasing ! He 's approaching infinite density . Well , that sucks for him . Not just him , man ! If Sheldon collapses in on himself , he 's gonna take the whole city with him ! Collapses in on himself ... Like a black hole ? How do we stop that ? You gotta siphon as much of that gravitational energy as possible ... And then get those trunks off him ! Just be careful , your suit might not be able to absorb another round of energy . We 'll just wait for ya here . Oh , thank you ! Okay ... Claudia , what 's happening ? The suit has absorbed his power . We gotta break the circuit ! We got to get those trunks off of him ! Pete ! Oy gevalt ! Myka , Myka . Are you okay ? Super . Is everyone ... ? My hero . I bought a bunch of stuff at a yard sale to replace what I 'd lost . The trunks were mixed in with gym clothes . Till I put them on , I ... had no idea they had such great power . Well , with great power comes great responsibility . What , is that , like , a thing or something ? What ? Maybe ... Maybe some identities are best kept secret . Wait , hold up . We 're just gonna let him go ? An artifact took control of him , and he hurt somebody that he loves . I mean , these things happen . I think we can forgive that , don 't you ? Yeah . Yeah . - I guess . - Yeah . And once again ... the city is safe ! Why is that so funny ? - That is so cute . - That 's what ... That 's what they say . This used be our house , James . I never wanted you gone . I want you back . I miss my partner . And now , because of this ... we 're connected forever . Maybe you knew that would happen . Maybe that 's why you put it in my pocket . Hello , Arthur . If you 're reading this , it 's probable that I 'm gone . Do you remember this watch ? We used to argue over it . I think you should have it . Good luck , old friend . I imagine you 're going to need it . I suppose we could chat from time to time ... If that 's even possi ... or not . Hey , Leena . It could have easily been me . MacPherson could have stuck the pearl of wisdom in my ear and turned me into his little stooge . Yes , he could have . He was a ... big , fat jerk who sucked . Thank you , Claudia . Hey , did Myka mention the ... ? Yeah . I 'm just gonna shelf this , and I 'll meet you over at the BB . Rock on . Mrs. Frederic . You told me to let you know if I ... I experienced anything strange . Oh , come on ! Just admit it was awesome ! - You know it was . - Okay , okay . I liked being a superhero , okay ? I mean , I got to kick ass and save countless lives . Don 't we kind of do that here anyway ? I suppose we do ... Odetta . Oona . No , Oksana . It 's Ophelia ! Okay ? Like from Hamlet , yes , Ophelia . Let the mocking ... commence . Ophelia ? That 's kind of ... beautiful . Can " Ophelia " boobies ? Snap ! Okay , so you ... still no word from ... about your stuff , right ? Not a one , my Ophelia . Nay ... Not a one . Well , come , ... lowly roustabout . - Yes , my darling , and all that . - Yes . Yes . Okay , keep going . Keep going . Okay , stop . One , two , three . - Ta-Da ! - Surprise ! You guys ! - It wasn 't us . - It was all Myka . She totally masterminded it . Oh , you know , it 's just a distraction until your stuff arrives . But just in case ... it doesn 't , then you can start to rebuild your collection ... with ... this . Issue 46 ? What , in mint condition ? Do you know how rare this is ? Yeah . Yeah , actually , I do . You have no idea what I had to do to get my hands on that . - This calls for cookies . - Oatmeal scotchies ? Please ? Please ? I have to apologize . I 've been extremely distracted , and I 'm back now . I 'm back 100 % . 100 % , huh ? Yeah . 120 % , all right ? Give me that . Saving your life . Okay , I 'd be distracted too if a ghost was chasing me . No , no . How many times do I have to articulate this ? Ghosts do not exist . What fools attribute to the phenomenon of ghosts - actually ... - Oh , my God , make it stop ! Not yet . I 'm someone who 's trying ... - to enlighten you . - So do you think this feels more like home now ? Nah . It 's better .

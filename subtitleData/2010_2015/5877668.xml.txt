 Previously on Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D ... You 're The Clairvoyant ? He let his emotions get the best of him . He wasn 't gonna stop , Skye . I wasn 't gonna let that happen . I 'm worried he killed the wrong man . The Clairvoyant doesn 't have abilities . He has security clearance . He 's an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Why would May have an unauthorized encrypted hardline in the cockpit ? Put it down , May ! Who do you answer to ? Who 's the real Clairvoyant ? Where are we going ? I don 't know . I didn 't do it ! When that plane touches down , take out everyone on board . Except Agent Coulson . He 's mine . Tower , this is S.H.I.E.L.D. to ECHO-3 . I 've got a pair of UAVs on my six . These friendlies ? Over . They 're gonna hit my jet wash if they get any closer . What the heck is that ? - Drop the weapon ! - Coulson ... Drop the damn weapon and kick it over to the stairs , May . Now ! Now ! Now back the hell up . Over there . Talk . Tell us where you rerouted the plane . - I didn 't set this new course . I swear ! - Don 't lie to me ! The plane just turned around for God 's sakes ! How is this happening then ? HQ can override automated control of the avionics . Take us anywhere they want . Let me check the instrument panel - and I 'll be able to ... - No way ! You 're not going anywhere till you explain what ... It 's not me ! Why did you have an encrypted hardline ? And tried to shoot me when we found it ! - Let 's take a breath ... - Let 's not ! It was a dedicated channel to Director Fury . - That 's the truth . - Director Fury ? I haven 't been able to get him on the line for weeks . - You were reporting to him ? - That 's all I can tell you . - Oh , just come out with it ! - That 's all you can tell us ? I 'm under orders . Fury will tell you . What , was this an order ? To shoot me in the bloody head ? Hold on . We 're not headed to Fury anymore . I don 't know where we 're headed . And I can 't get Fury on the line because Fitz cut the line . Skye told me to . Someone was talking to The Clairvoyant , the real Clairvoyant . You were in the walls , Fitz . You wanna explain why you were tampering with the plane 's sat cables ? Sure , because that 's relevant . Don 't try and turn this around on me ! Fitz ... I was trying to speak to Simmons at the Hub . You needed an encrypted line ? What 's so secret that ... You tell me ! Simmons and I know you two have been whispering , keeping things from us about the drug that saved your life . Simmons is just trying to figure out how the whole thing works ! Fitz , who is she talking to ? - Fitz , open the door . - No way . Not until we sort this out . - I 'm not opening anything . - Open the door . We can 't get anything sorted until you open the damn door . Skye , get your laptop hooked up to our systems . See if you can pull up any S.H.I.E.L.D. communications . I wanna know where this plane is headed , and why . - Coulson ... - You stay put ! Now tell me who Simmons is talking to ? 'Cause if it isn 't someone we trust , she 's in serious danger . Agent Simmons . I was wondering where you snuck off to . Busy ? Yes . But that 's okay . It 's noisy here today . Lot of guys in action mode . I asked around . Guess it 's a Level 8 operation of some sort . Mmm . I was surprised to have this room to myself . So , what are you working on ? Wow . Coulson 's team is awfully secretive , even for this organization . Are you hiding something , Agent ? No , it 's just nothing important . I hope not . 'Cause I remember us tracking down a drug that brought a girl back from the brink , and that was real important . Yes , I know . Come to think of it , I don 't remember seeing it in the dispatches . Or you mentioning it when Agent Blake got his ribs caved in . I wasn 't in a position ... 'Cause if you had the means and you didn 't use them , that blood is all over your hands , too . I know . I 'm trying . Look , men died to keep this secret . We don 't understand why . So we wanted to keep our research in-house , for safety . - Research ? - That 's hit a dead end . I 'm uploading Skye 's blood scans . I would like to contact Agent Weaver at S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy , covertly . For a little help . But we must keep this between us . Please . I don 't want any trouble . You 're Level 5 ? My Level 6 clearance gives me access to the Holobox . Secure line . But we can 't sneak that in here ? Can we ? Agent Hand seems to be keeping everyone busy . We 'll be good . But , if we get questioned , let me talk . You 're a surprisingly bad liar , Agent Simmons . I know . But I 'm getting better at it . What do you mean , " noise ? " I mean literally , noise . Across every S.H.I.E.L.D. communication channel . Some sort of blanket signal . - Encoded data , maybe ? - I think so . You wanna fill us in ? We root you out , a mole , suddenly our plane shuts down , our communications jammed . I don 't know what 's happening , I wish I did . - You have to believe me . - No , I don 't . Do you read , 616 ? Where is that coming from ? - Close . - Enemy aircraft on my tail ! Over . Garrett ' ? - Coulson , I 'm under attack . Drones . Repeat , S.H.I.E.L.D. drones are on my ass . - We 're not getting along . Do you copy ? - Copy . Garrett , what 's happening ? We 've lost control of our aircraft . Hell if I know . Tell me you got guns on that thing . I 'm coming to you ! Ohh ! Fitz , can you manually wire the guns to weapons control ? BYPASS Our system ? If I have cables long enough , yes . Skye , decode the signal . We need to get ahead of this . I don 't want any more surprises today . - What happened ? - She 's a sleeper . I mean , the other kind of sleeper . Wait , what are you saying ? She 's been reporting on us this whole time . Controls are live , sir . Garrett , what 's your 20 ? I 'll be on top of you in seconds . At your 10 o 'clock . - Guns hot ? - Warming up . He needs to pull up , sir . Hey , hey , Garrett , pull up ! He knows what he 's doing . - Damn it ! - That was Joanie . Any thoughts on Chachi ? Now it knows you 're here . Wanna roll over , play dead ? Okay , Phil , but you better make it quick . I 'm running on fumes . I 'll pull up even with your six . - Better not miss . - Copy that . Ready when you are , Boss . " Play dead . " What does that mean ? It means I better not miss . Booyah ! Drones are down . Agent Garrett 's alive and docking with S.H.I.E.L.D. 616 . I suggest we send more men . Shoot that airplane out of the sky . No . We couldn 't seize automated control of Garrett 's jet , so I wrote it off as a loss . But now that he 's with Coulson , we can cross him off with the rest when they land . Preserve the aircraft . You got something to say , Agent Shaw ? Apologies , ma 'am . I 'm just having a hard time killing the people we once called friends . Once that encoded transmission went out , everything changed . You understand that , don 't you ? We swore allegiance to each other . And today , that loyalty will be tested . If you waver , you die . It 's a simple message repeated , semantic encoding . I needed to find the mnemonic key . It should only take me a minute more to decipher . Can I ask the obvious question ? What the hell ? We don 't know . We don 't even know where our plane is headed . I saw your trajectory . You 're being tractor-beamed straight to the Hub . Those drones were launched out of there , for sure . Victoria Hand . Hand ? It can 't be . - Can 't be what now ? - The Clairvoyant . I thought Ward capped that guy . I don 't believe the man Ward killed was The Clairvoyant . I think he was an unwitting decoy meant to end our investigation . That 's a lot of trouble to go through for a red herring , don 't you think ? Because The Clairvoyant is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent . Using high-level clearance to stay ahead of us , make it seem like she 's got psychic abilities . She ? You think Victoria Hand 's the Clairvoyant ? I don 't mean to pee in the punch bowl , but that doesn 't make a lot of sense . I was stationed with Vic in Lisbon . She 's a hard-ass and a buzzkill at parties , I grant you , but you really think she 's capable of that ? Excuse me , didn 't she just try to blow you out of the sky ? Don 't get me wrong , she 's definitely gone nuts , but her actions prove she 's not The Clairvoyant , right ? I mean , if she 's been hiding in plain sight all this time , why reveal herself now ? Guys ... Well , I 'll be ... I thought HYDRA was defeated after World War II . It was . S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded in the wake of that victory . - And now they 're back ? - HYDRA always comes back . Cut off a head , two more will take its place . - Is it a head ? I thought it was a limb . - " Cut off a limb . " - it 's a head . - But it was sent from a S.H.I.E.L.D. source . It 's got to be some sort of activation signal to HYDRA members within S.H.I.E.L.D. Hand must be one of them . Okay , stop , $ 109 - What does that mean ? In S.H.I.E.L.D. ? Targeting Level 8 agents , seizing power . Wonder how deep it goes . This signal is everywhere . Deep . - You know what this means ? - Yeah , we 're screwed . We can 't change course . And we have no idea what 's waiting for us at the Hub . The Hub . I say we blow a hole in the side of this puppy and parachute out . Live to fight another day . We can 't . It 's a cherry ride , I 'll give you that , but let 's not just hand over the keys . Simmons is at the Hub . We have to save her . Oh , crap , yeah . Trip 's there , too . I don 't mind saying , I don 't like the odds on this one . We should let your specialist out of their cage . We can use every weapon we can get . We 've gotta save her . So , we 'll fly in there , face the music . Even if it is the HYDRA theme song . Agents Triplett and Simmons are unaccounted for , ma 'am . Searches are underway . They don 't have anywhere to go . Don 't underestimate Coulson 's people . Tie up those loose ends . You 're positive this line is secure ? Yeah , but be quick . Nothing looks more guilty than sneaking around . I sent her a request , she must not have ... Agent Weaver , thank you for joining me . Jemma , thank God you 're still alive . What , what 's wrong ? Is the Hub still secure ? Are you with your team ? Get somewhere safe and lock the door . What 's happening ? Have your commander ... The Academy is under siege ... We don 't know how long HYDRA 'S been inside S.H.I.E.L.D. , but they are taking control ! HYDRA ' ? What ' ? Where ' ? Everywhere . Among us . If you survive , you know where to find me . Jemma , don 't trust anyone . What are you doing ? What the lady said to do . Locking the door . - Let me out . - Go ahead . The door won 't hold if they come looking , but they won 't come around this way for a little while . I 'm staying . How do I know I can trust you ? Because I 'm trustworthy . You 're the one who works for the zombie robot back from the dead . Take it . If you try to kill me with it , I 'll know I can 't trust you . Now , fire that thing back up . Let 's see if we can get our friends on the line . Can 't wait to tell them the good news . Coulson said you 're an informant . Wanna elaborate on that ? No , I don 't . Damn ICER . My head 's killing me . I deserve to know . Don 't start with that . We do our jobs , end of story . I can 't tell you any more until Fury gives the go-ahead . You 're good . I mean , I always heard you were good . But , man , playing us this whole time ? Conning me ? Coulson ... I wasn 't playing anyone . I had your backs . And reported on us behind them . You know , you always said to keep my emotions in check , but this is some next level ... And you should have listened . You killed a man in cold blood . Let your emotions get the best of you . It was to protect our team from a monster . It was to protect her . Which would be okay , if you hadn 't shot the wrong guy . Fitz repaired your direct line . If you have the ability to make this right , now 's the time . 'Cause you can 't make it worse . I have orders not to do this with anyone else present . { THUD ) % GRUNTS ) They 're taking out our guns . Get Director Fury on the line , or I 'll march you out there first . Sir ! - What is going on ? - A whole lot . Who is shooting at us ? Come here , let me catch you up . Apparently , Agent Hand is The Clairvoyant , so chew on that first . Agent Melinda May . Voice command . Emergency Protocol One . Emergency Protocol One . Hello ? This is an X1-0 straight connection to Director Fury 's personal line . Where is he ? Director Fury is dead . Can that be true ? About Fury ? Man was my S.O. , Coulson 's , too . Proved himself more than once to be a hard man to kill . That sound outside doesn 't bode well , though . Is there anything on this plane you don 't want them to get their hands on ? That was his direct line , Phil . So it 's real ? That means it 's just you and me . Unless there were other parties you reported to . There weren 't . Then come out with it . Fury 's gone and we 're being shot at by our own people . Fury knew you 'd want me to join up . Asked me to keep an eye on you . Looking for what ? Signs of physical or mental deterioration . To keep him updated . It 's that simple . Did you know about T.A.H.I.T.I. ? How could you do that to me ? After all we 've been through ? The years we spent together in ops ? He said it was essential . You couldn 't know . The time I spent sifting through the ashes with you in Bahrain ? I gave you a second chance when I assembled this team . I assembled this team . What ? I evaluated what was needed and I gave the assessment to Fury , and he gave you the parameters for your unit . What was needed , May ? Someone who could repair your body , a technician who could reprogram your brain , and a specialist to help me put you down if it had to be done . But I didn 't do it for Fury . I did it for you . To protect you . You mean a lot to me . A lot . To hear you were dead ... You may not believe me , but that 's the truth . And I have nothing to do with The Clairvoyant , or this HYDRA threat we 're up against . Hopefully , this helps prove that . I wanna believe you . But you 've used that against me this whole time . They 've stopped firing . No clear shots through the windows . They wanna preserve the aircraft . A surgical strike team is next . Fitz cut the hydraulics on the cargo ramp . - They 'll have to pry it open . - That won 't hold them long . We need to plan to get out of here with whatever we can take with us . About that ... The 084 specs , Asgardian weaponry , portal creation , Donnie 's weather machine . If they get their hands on Gravitonium in the Fridge ... It 's below the Fridge . No records . Okay . But on the off chance , we 'd give them the designs to weaponize it . The drug from T.A.H.I.T.I. , sir ? All here . If HYDRA is really about to seize this plane ... We should wipe the system . I 'm backing it up on this hard drive to keep our edge . Then do it . Scrub the plane clean . - It 'll take some time . - We 're working on buying you some . I 'm telling you , this signal is clogging everything up . Something terrible has happened . Freeze ! Show me your hands ! Show me your hands ! Go ! Go ! Move ! Move ! Move up ! Move up ! Going up . It 's called a Mouse Hole . Cuts through anything really . I designed it a year ago and submitted it for testing , but it never reached distribution . Top agents always hog the good stuff . You 're right , the hard drive 's safer in your hands . You haven 't taught me how to hold up under torture yet . We 'll get to that , it 's real fun . All right , here 's where we split . Skye and Ward ... Heading to the Nerve Center . Disable their systems , most importantly their control of our plane . - Copy that . - Remember , these agents are under orders . Use ICERs only . We 'll find Simmons , get her out . We should go straight for Hand . HYDRA 'S always talking about getting their heads cut off , right ? Saving Simmons and Triplett , that 's our priority . I agree , and that 's how I 'd get it done . - Hope you have a better plan . - Phil , I can help ... We need your help , but the cuffs stay on . The rest of your possibly very short lives hinges on this moment . HYDRA has successfully infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. at the highest level . It only took seven decades . And today is our coming out party . We have the support of the Level 9 and Level 10 agents . And those who have resisted HYDRA have been crossed off . Director Fury included . I 'm here to offer you a choice , and a simple one at that . Either swear unwavering loyalty to HYDRA right now for all time , or share Fury 's fate . I won 't wait long . Cross us off , and one of you goes , too . Right answer . The number of people I trust is now seven . Where are we on the roundup ? We 're moving all agents below Level 5 to East Holding . I have men monitoring microphones placed in most of the rooms . - And our strike team ? - Has stormed the plane , yes . That was a test ? That very few have passed . I thought we were dead . You 're not HYDRA . Thank God . Don 't celebrate just yet . We may not be HYDRA . But your friend Coulson ? He is . Oh , they captured Agent Coulson . And The Cavalry herself . Go upstairs , they 'll need assistance . They 're headed ... Here . We caught ' em , the slippery bastards . Agent May took one of mine in the arm . Softy , there , wouldn 't let her bleed out . You need medical assistance ? Just your sidearm . Okay , come on , Simmons . Where are you ? - Report back to me . - Yes , ma 'am . What ? We 've searched the plane , ma 'am . No sign of them . They were on board when it landed . We are tearing this plane apart . They must 've snuck off somehow . Check the tunnels . I want two squads posted in every corridor . Capture who you can , but you have permission to use lethal force . Yes , ma 'am . You were right , we should 've blown that plane out of the sky . Are you mad ? How can you be saying this ? HYDRA won 't show mercy . Neither can we . There 's no way Coulson is HYDRA . He is a good man . A friend . He 's a liar ! Agent Blake came to me with his suspicions that Coulson and the other Level 8 's were involved in some sort of conspiracy . Then Coulson sent him on an op that put him in the ICU . Coulson is not capable of what you 're insinuating . Agent Jacobson , Coulson 's crimes ? Recruiting known enemies of S.H.I.E.L.D. , disobeying a direct order , multiple counts , violation of international law . To rescue our beloved Professor Hall , who ended up dead by his hand . Failure to report the crimes of his protégé Akela Amador . Whose same technology somehow ended up in the head of Mr. Peterson , and you know his crimes . You helped us save Coulson from The Clairvoyant . Yet , when we found this brain-dead Clairvoyant , Coulson 's man Ward shot him before we could learn a single thing about him . The lies add up , Agent Simmons . Are you telling me he 's never kept a secret from you ? The worst thing you can do right now is to underestimate HYDRA . They hide in plain sight , they earn our trust , our sympathy . They make us like them . And when you hesitate , they strike . If we 're to survive , we must learn to strike first . Lethal force is authorized . Shoot to kill . Damn . The processing center 's at the end of that hall . Give me your ICER . - What are you gonna do ? - Pave the way for you . - There 's , like , 100 guys out there . - Twelve . Level 5 foot soldiers , basic armor package , and no other way through . The others are depending on us . But it 's suicide . Not if I don 't die . - And if I do ... - Slow down . Maybe I deserve to . I killed an innocent man , Skye . You didn 't know . You thought you were doing the right thing . You thought he was going to ... To hurt you . If we make it out of this , maybe we can grab a drink . You and me . - Are you ... - Remember in that bar in Dublin ? You offered to talk . I didn 't wanna talk . I needed to keep things compartmentalized . Like With May ? I 'm not an idiot . We live on the same plane together , for God 's sake . Well , with her , I knew I could . With you ? I didn 't wanna risk it . I was offering to talk , Ward . Not to have sex with you . I 'm not saying that . I 'm saying I want a chance to take you up on it . To have that talk . Look , I know I 'm not that guy . I 'm too locked down , too boring , but ... When we make it out of this , yes , let 's have a drink . You said you might die , so , what the hell ? Lock the door behind me . Ahhh ! Hey . You should really look up the word " boring " in a dictionary . You ready to hack the system ? Who said anything about hacking ? There . Agent Hand . Outside the East Wing Situation Room . This is definitely a situation . Simmons ... We don 't move until we find Simmons . I 'll say it again , best bet to save her ? Use the ventilation system to get above the Sit Room . Drop down using Fitz 's sweet little Mouse Hole and put two bullets through Victoria Hand 's heart . - It 's an option , sir . - Without questioning ? Questioning what ? Whether she wants to kill us fast or slow ? Last time we did that , we shot the wrong man . Because she wanted us to . Phil , this is a battle for S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s soul , and we 're on the front lines . History will remember us this day . That 's right . It 's for S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s soul . And murder without consideration is a ... Consideration ? Consider this ! She had one of my men killed with a bomb rigged to his gas pedal . Two other two were floating in the hotel pool , and they weren 't doing the backstroke . But we can just as easily ICE her . You don 't put someone like her on ice . She had Skye shot in the stomach . In the stomach , because she was curious . Mike Peterson burned alive and turned into some kind of freak . She tortured you using the same machine she used to brainwash that bitch in the flower dress . And right now , she 's probably doing the same to Agent Simmons . Oh , I 've considered it plenty , my friend . No , Simmons will be fine . Just being realistic , kid . I never mentioned that . I 'm telling you , killing her quick would be a mercy . I never said Raina had been inside the machine . I never told that to anybody . I must 've read it in a report , then . You weren 't with us . The point is , how many more have to suffer before Vic gets hers ? - You showed up right after . - What are you driving at ? After Skye was shot , Quinn said it was so I would lead The Clairvoyant to the cure . That 's exactly what I did . I walked you right in there with me . Phil , look , it 's been a rough day , I get it . But you need to take a second and ... Damn it . - Freeze ! Don 't move . - Hands where I can see them . Easy , fellas . Take Agent Garrett into custody ! He 's the murderer they call The Clairvoyant . He 's a traitor ! Gentlemen . I know Agent Sitwell was in charge of filling your ranks , so at least a few of you know what to do in this situation . Anytime , boys . Hail HYDRA . Hail HYDRA ! Those three men in your unit ? Guess they asked the wrong questions ? Until today , it was all about keeping the secret . Are you gonna kill us ? That wasn 't my plan , really . If it was , I could 've done that any time I wanted . No , Coulson and I go way back . Back to the days when Fury was teaching us tactics . Clearing corners . Slicing the pie . Remember , Phil ? Fury would bury you for this . Probably . Instead , he 'll just have to roll over in his grave . He must 've uncovered our secret . Top brass did what they had to do . Explains why we 've suddenly " come out of the shadows . " Not a minor inconvenience , I might add . Top brass ? Oh my , yes . Tip-top . We had a good thing going , too . Waving the S.H.I.E.L.D. flag as hard as we could . I guess we 'll be changing colors now . For HYDRA ? You really believe all that crap ? Spreading death and destruction ? I wouldn 't say I 'm a true believer . Let 's just say , I felt the wind changing direction and swung my sail . You really should , too . I would die before serving HYDRA , you sick son of a bitch . I hate to tell you , but you 've been serving HYDRA all along . I guess death is the only alternative . It 's a sad thing . I consider you a friend . I was happy when I heard you 'd made it through . So happy you had me tortured for three days to find out how they did it . I didn 't enjoy that . Phil , this is me being honest . No , John , this is you being a psychopath . I know you 'd follow him to the grave , so ... As for you , Agent Fitz ? You 'll hold a very high rank on our tech division , if you volunteer . If not , you 'll have no rank and a lot of pain . Of course , either way , your services will be required . You 're gonna suffer for what you 've done . And I plan on being a very big part of that . I like you , kid . All right , let them have it , but shoot that one in the kneecaps . Was that all of them ? Wasn 't as big as I thought ... Ahhh ! Coulson ! - Hands up ! Don 't move ! - Drop your weapon . I 'm not HYDRA . We heard . Everything . Who is ? How deep does it go ? Captain America has defeated the Helicarriers at the Triskelion . But his status is unknown . And S.H.I.E.L.D. has fallen . HYDRA factions have taken control of our East African Headquarters and the Treehouse . And those are just the ones we know of . It 's gonna be a scramble , a power grab . I 'll head to the Fridge . At least that facility is secure . I don 't need to remind you how imperative it is that it stay that way . And I 'll find Agent Garrett the smallest , darkest cell in the Ice Box . I 'd like to turn the key on that cell myself . If you don 't mind , sir . He was my S.O. I feel I should 've known . - It 's my duty to ... - No one knew . I didn 't know . That 's how he beat us . By being a friend . I spent years with that bastard . Looked up to him . I want to see him suffer . Don 't mind the company , and I can always use a man of your skills . Pick up the pieces here at the Hub if you can . And only communicate using one of these . You and I may be the highest-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who aren 't HYDRA or dead . Not that that means anything now . All we have is each other . So stay in touch , Agent Coulson . I guess you can call me Phil . It 's all gone . In pieces , at least . Skye , try to restore some of the firmware in the plane 's systems . Fitz-Simmons , get a crew together , help May patch the holes . You still want me on board ? You 're not a friend . But I do believe you 're an ally . We need all the allies we can get . What are we planning to do next ? Survive . - Course is locked , ma 'am . - Good . He 's not telling stories now , is he ? You know what I 'm thinking , Agent Garrett ? I 'm thinking the Ice Box or the Fridge is a little too comfortable for you . Maybe we should put you a little deeper underground . What do you think , Agent Ward ? You shot the wrong Clairvoyant before . Care to shoot the right one ? Did I tell you about this one time I was deep undercover ? The Sicilian backup team , a no-show of course . So I dropped in through the skylight , used up my whole mag , and hit the final guy in the chest with a flare gun . Boy , you should 've seen the look on that guy 's face when that thing went off . Oh , man . He didn 't know what hit him .

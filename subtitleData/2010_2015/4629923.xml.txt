 I left some stuff in the cellar , is it okay if I get them ? - Yeah , sure . - Great . - Don 't worry about the shoes . - I don 't wanna mess up your floor . - We 're getting ready for bed . - Turning in early these days , huh ? Hello , Malte . Hey . I 'm just getting some stuff from the cellar , then I 'll leave you love birds alone . I can do it , you go and have a beer . Roger , give Malte a beer . No , no , no ... Wait a minute . Now I get it , you 're trying to keep me here . But it 's okay , I 'll take care of my stuff and you do yours ... I 'm really sorry for the other day , if I seemed pissed and negative . - That 's okay . - Now I want you to forget me , have a wonderful time together and don 't give a shit about me . I wanna go down to the cellar ! I pity the poor guy , he 's not well . It 'll be all right , don 't be afraid . It 's okay ... I need a beer . Bea ! ? REAL HUMANS Rick 's gotten so cocky . Bo is really strange too . He tried to fool me into believing that he 'd been to the zoo . Looking at lions and stuff . You know ... It 's not that late , we could go out . - Just you and me ? - Yes , what do you think ? - Hello . - Hey , guys . What are you doing ? - We were just talking . - About what ? Guys . If Pilar and I were to go out for a drink , could you stay here ? - We 'll come along . - We want to go out , just the two of us . - You could watch TV , or ... - There 's nothing good on TV . Watch a movie then . Yes ! - We can all watch a movie . - No , Rick ... we need to go alone . - No ! - Well , then I take Bo home myself . No . We 're doing this . Good . If you go out alone , Bo and I can also go out alone . Stop arguing about this . I must be able to go out with Pilar , without you . And I said it was okay , but then Bo and I will also go out . Who 's arguing ? - Don 't argue ! - That 's right . Therese , no , no ! I didn 't say anything . But I didn 't say anyth ... They 'll get over it . Come on , let 's go . I live here . The regular joe street . Are all the houses the same ? Think so ... - And everyone 's got a hubot ? - Maybe not everyone ... Mom says she 's gonna buy one . She says it all the time , like she could afford one . It 's nothing special ... It 's cold . It 's warm during the day , but not ... - See you . - Yes . There you are , Tobbe . Hey . Just the garbage ... I 'm sorry . But I have nothing left . Absolutely nothing left . You want to go to a hospital ? Don 't know . I was fighting with mom too . We argued and I don 't wanna go back there . - So where can you stay ? - I don 't know . And I fucked a hubot ! At Hubot Heaven ! So fucking disgusting ! I spew on myself ! I can 't stand hating myself ! I can 't stand hating ... Calm down , Malte . Drink ! Drink , drink . I can 't stand it , I can 't stand it ... Malte , listen to me . Can I just talk to Bea for a minute and we 'll be right back ? - Yees ... - Just don 't go nuts . - We can 't let him go . - Why not ? Think about what we 've done . The bombing . He may talk . - He 's whacked out . We 'd get busted . - So he 's gonna stay here now ? Just for the night , until he 's okay . He needs someone to look after him . We can 't send him to the hospital , he may start talking . But if he wants to die , maybe we should let him . What do you mean ? I just thought we were doing so great . " Doing so great " ? We 're still doing great . But Malte and I were friends . Don 't you understand ? If you had a friend , you 'd do the same for her , if she needed somewhere to stay . Okay . - It 's inhuman . - You 've made that clear . Come on . Malte . You can sleep here tonight . You can take my bed . - And where will you sleep . - Next to you . It 's wide . Come on . - That 's so nice of you . - It 's okay . - Someone took my gun . - Bea took your gun . No , it wasn 't Bea . It was someone else . BOMBING AT HOBOT MARKET ONE PERSON BADLY INJURED Get out . Leave me alone ! - Yes ? - This is Jonas Moberg at Hubmarket . - Do you think we can meet again ? - Sure , come down anytime . Can we do it privately ? - So be it . - I 'll tell you where later . Thank you . Excuse me . That 's all right . Did you have a good time at the movies yesterday ? Yes ... - You were there with ? - " Ape " , she 's in class 9c . Ape ? Apollonia , I think . You could have invited Apollonia in for a cup of tea or something . We were just at the movies . And ? - Nothing . - Oh ... Tonight both mom and I will be working late , and Anita will be busy with Sofia . And I don 't think Mathilda will be home . If you ... If you and Apollonia want to be here after school , do homework and stuff . You and your partner never discussed if looking out for these units may be illegal ? Me and Åsa isn 't a couple anymore . I see . Excuse me . Yes , I brought up the legality of it several times . But she wouldn 't listen . - Maybe you talked to her ? - We have spoken to Åsa . Then they disappeared . After what Niska did to me , they were just gone . I 'm still scared . I can 't go out , can 't sleep , I just see these images before my eyes . I think they will look me up . I 'm sure of it . Knowing , or just thinking about that they 're out there somewhere is disgusting . - Give me some time with him . - We need to move on , Bea . - Gather our strenght and find Leo . - Leo is in custody , and safe ... - I don 't trust that he 's safe . - Trust me , they will keep him alive . This man , Roger . Whom you have chosen . Does he love you ? - I think so . - " Think " ? He may just be in love . - Is that something else ? - Yes . Being in love is fleeting . It could be over in a summer . - I think this idea is weak . - It 's worth a try . I think we should get rid of him and the other man staying here . To move on . No more unnecessary killing . What has that gotten us so far ? - Just keep on running away ? - We can live here , even if they 're dead . We 're in the midst of humans . This is not like it was with David . Neighbors , relatives , friends . And they notice the smallest change . We can stuff him and put him in the window . That was a joke . If we 're to set roots and grow , we need a living human as host . We cannot operate outside their societies . I 've been among them long enough to know what drives them into doing what they do . Love has kept humans together for thousands of years . The only force that makes them endure or defend anything . You will make him die for you ? Yes . - How long will that take . - As I said , It 's hard to ... - How long ? - Soon . Will you have sex with him ? - I think it 's necessary . - You 've done it before ? - I know how it 's done . - If anything can expose you . It 's that . Unless you can make him love you , for who you really are . A hubot . Hello . Hello . I 'm sorry . I will just boot . - It will take a while . - Sure . There . You were saying ? - I said I was sorry . - Okay ! Hey . Won 't you come lie down for awhile ? Well , Okay ! I said I was sorry . Sit here and pout , do as you please ! I don 't know his name , but Ove Holm at EHURB and the DA 's know this case . Sure , I understand , but I want this to be presented to the Minister for Justice . Sorry , I mean the Secretary of State . Listen to me . I have the preliminary investigation and the file of the accused , - If he disappears or dies , I 'm taking everything I know , straight to the media . But wait ! I 'd like to see my defense attorney . I 'll see what I can do . You can leave us . If he doesn 't get electricity , he will die . But it 'll take time . Not even the process of decomposition killed him right away . If it 's to go faster ? Remove the skull , open it up and remove the content . Even at this stage , I 'd call this a slow , active murder . It 's inhuman . - Thank you . - And he wants to see his attorney . - I know . - I 'd like to ask you something . - What do you gain by his death ? - It 's not the pleasure , Oldoz . It 's his computer , in his head . It could contain information that may help us to prevent a human catastrophe . We 're not evil . You talk about humanity , try to imagine a world without any humans to cry for . Does it look like I 'm crying ? Hello . Karl , we have a problem . Well , another one . Did you say you were going to the media ? Yes . But you 're sworn to secrecy ! Who did you speak to ? A secretary at the Ministry of Justice . Wonderful . - They were going to kill him . - I won 't speculate about this . - You represent us , not a hubot activist . - He 's a human being . - Opinions differ on that . - If you met him ... When you sign something like this , you sign for the entire firm . I didn 't consent to a bloody murder , now did I ? Yes ! Good morning . Okay . Absolutely , sure . Thank you . You should have told me and you 've been so disloyal , I should fire you right now ! - Yes , I unders ... - Let me finish ! - You and I ... will talk later . - I had to do this ! You 're off . Go . Right now . There ! I suppose your client is still alive . - Who was on the phone . - My mom . Now go . Get out of here . I really need your help , honey . To get David Eischer 's file from the national archives . Family , friends , everything . And pictures . Passport photos will do . - Thanks for telling me now . - What ? Work starts in ten minutes . I 'll call and tell them you 're sick . You can 't talk . - What ? - Kiss , honey . And thank you . Good morning , Kevin . - Don 't be late for school . - Shut up . - What did you say ? - I said shut up . If you think you 're my dad , you 're broken . - Just trying to be nice , Kevin . - Give it a rest . Roger 's not your dad either . Watch it . - You 're sick ! - Wrong , Kevin . I can 't get sick . Kev went to school ? God ... Keep this up and I might as well have you shut down all the time . - Yes , he went to school . - Oh , thank you . I don 't think it 's fair to talk like that . It 's not okay . How would you feel if I threatened to turn you off if you made a mistake ? - I don 't have a switch . - And I 'm an appliance because I have ? - We just wanted to go out alone . - I that what this is about ? But I said I was sorry ! But that 's not good enough for you . Not only should I feel guilty about Kevin , but now , you as well ? I can 't stand that . - Then don 't . - What ? Just don 't feel guilty . Okay ... Well ... I 'm off to the gym to work , are you coming or staying at home ? Bo is there . Just choose . Okay . No answer equals " no " . I 'm coming . - Thank you very much . - There 's only water to drink . I know , I have to go shopping . - Aren 't you having some ? - No . - You never get hungry ? - No . - Could you still like me ? - Oh , yeah . - Even though I never sleep ? - Oh , yeah . I 'd even like you with a beard . I mean if you had it , not if you were a man . - If I was battery powered ? - Oh , yeah . If I was a hubot ? No , no , no . That 's where I draw the line . I love you . I mean ... I like you . Shit ... I 'm sorry . Do you love me ? - You said that you love me . - Can 't you tell ? No . No , this is just ridiculous . I 'm much older than you and you can have anyone you want . You don 't have to say anything . It 's okay . No . No , Roger , let go ! I 'm sorry . - Don 't kiss me if you don 't want me . - I 'm just scared . Scared of what ? That you 'll hate me when you know who I really am . What the hell is this .. ? - Where are you going ? - Need to do some shopping . I love you . Just so you know . If you have something to say about who you really are , just say it . Think about it . No I can 't . Stand by the door . Tell me when David gets back . - But why ... - Just do as I say . Help ! Beatrice ! Beatrice ! Where is Niska ? I 'm Niska . - I want to get out of here . - And you will . Soon . Then you will go to the humans . Where you will prepare yourself . And when we get out of here , you will come find us . Let me go ! I want out of here ! Let me go ! - Mom ? - Go to bed . - Go to bed . - Mom ? There . Calm down . Let her go . BUY A FRIEND FOR LIFE Do you want some tea ? Sure . We can be in my room , go there and I will bring tea . - And where is your room ? - Right . It 's there . - Do you want anything ? - I 'll take care of it . - But it can do it . - No , what for ? Go up to Sofia 's room . Sure . - Isn 't it what they 're for ? - She 's not an attendant . Okay ... sorry . My room is over here . Right ... the tea . Forget about the tea . - What did Bo say when he woke up ? - Bo was just the same as usual . I don 't get what 's come over Rick . He was so pissed . You know , the things we 've done to them ... It can go sideways , I 've read about it in blogs . But what do you do ? I want Rick to be like Bo . Excuse me . You can put it straight , just be strict and consistent . You think I 'm completely satisfied with Bo ? - You 're not ? - No ... No . I 'd like him to be more like Rick . Rick is a pain in the ass , right now . - I 'll be right there . Look . HUBOT INSPECTION In a month , he 's called to inspection . - Excuse me . I 've gotten one too , I know . - Hi . - Hi , I 'd like to attend CrossFit at 5 pm . Should we go to the mall ? You should feel it here . Come on , go for it . Great . One ... Two ... Is it me ? No , it 's me . Okay ... I don 't get why you wanted to see me . Neither do I ... I really liked you . But I 'm not cheap , like I know they say about me . Damn you , if you spread something that 's not true ! Fuck ... - Do you have any laundry , Tobias ? - Out ! Get out of here . Hello . - Let 's get out of here . - Let 's have some fun first . What are you doing here ? Where are your owners ? - At the gym . - We don 't have any . - Not the locker room , or anywhere . - They just took off ! - Bo would never do that . - Could they be stolen ? - They could have gone home . - What , Bo has keys ? - No ... - No . Neither does Rick . And we can 't call the police . Shit ! - This was all I needed . - Calm down . As long as they behave , no one will check them out . - We 're leaving now . - A hug , at least ? Go for it . What the hell are you doing ? Hurry up . Can 't we just talk ? - I want to go home . - We follow them home . - Can 't we just go back , Rick ? Come on , come on . - Goodbye ! Hello ! ? Wait ! - Okay ? It 'll be all right . - Okay . Thank you so much . RECORDS OF DECEASED Thank you . - What happened ? - He followed ... - Where ? - I don 't know . - My God ! - I came here , I don 't know ... - He said that he 'd just talk . - Talk ? And where did he go ? - I don 't know . They took the escala ... - The escalator ? But where did he go ? You shouldn 't have shut us off yesterday . There 's not much we don 't already know . David had no siblings , and ... The parents died in the 90 's . The son , Leo , died in an drowning accident , where David 's wife Beatrice also died . David Eischer himself , died three months ago . Suicide . I 'm about to meet him , so I have to go . Kiss . I 'd like to see him alone . Wait a minute . She wants to see him alone . - Should we ... - Just do as she says . I wanted to see you again , to offer a collaboration . Oh ? We 're looking for the same thing . But you wouldn 't recognize it without me , and I wouldn 't find it without you . As you know , my father and David Eischer were good friends . David carried on with research while my father started Hub market . Will we be talking today ? Yes . Inger Engman . Leo Eischer . The code David made can 't be extracted from the system where it 's installed . That means , you could only spread it by way of the original , the source code . So , even if you found a liberated hubot , there 's no way of extracting the code . - Have you dealt with liberated units ? - No . It 's a felony , you know that . Okay . How would you be able to help us ? What 's this collaboration of yours ? Even if I placed the code right under your nose , you wouldn 't recognize it . - No one would . Except me . - Except you ? David was careful , but ... He wrote the first lines of code in letters to my father . I would recognize the code . You have the letters ? What do you want in return ? Money ? That 's one possibility . We 'll talk when you have something solid . Until then I 'd rather not see you . In every way . We 've got quite a lot to go through , Leo . - Excuse me . - Sure . - I get a little hot when I 'm plugged in . - I understand . I didn 't kill those old people . And I 'm not involved in the bombing . - But it 's not what we will discuss . - Okay . I will be recording this . It has a firewall , so no one can monitor it . - You 're in a hurry . - No , don 't worry . It thought we should talk a bit , about you . Who are you ? - Where do you come from , Leo ? - I thought you knew . - I want you to tell me . - You 're in a hurry , Inger . No , no . I wanted to meet you , so that you 'll understand that you 're in a hurry . - You have a hubot . - Yes ... I was coming to her . She has a mark on her arm . Now listen to me . Then go and do exactly as I say . I don 't know anything about you . I take a tremendous risk if I trust you . I think I can . - Absolutely . - Your hubot . My Mimi must be protected from everyone . Take her from your house and hide her . Okay . But I 'd like to know what this is about . It 's about my father 's work . That 's all I can say . You 're the only one who knows . You have to swear never to reveal it . - I promise . - So you understand the responsibility , even if I die , Mimi has to be protected . You have to give her something from me . Give me pen and paper . Give this to Mimi and ask her to memorize it before she destroys it . Don 't ask what it is , just do as I say . Got any ID ? What have they done to you ? It 's just me . What the hell was that ? - My cord . - What is this ? You wanted to know everything about me . Now you do . I 'm a hubot . No ... You want to leave me now ? Throw me out ? Destroy me ? If you thought all hubots were the same , you were mistaken . I 'm not like the others . I don 't love you because I was told to . I chose you . I don 't want any other man . Do you hate me now ? No ... You want to feel it ? Yes . Can you love me despite of this ? Yes , I will try to find a cab . See you soon . Bye . - My God , I 'm sorry . - That 's all right . Thank you . - Good night , honey . - Good night , Anita . See you in the morning . Anita . Yes ? Come , you have to see something . What is it ? - I 'm sorry for shouting before . - That 's all right . I like you . I like you too , Tobias . I mean I really like you ... a lot ... Thank you . Well ... In love ... I 'm in love with you . That 's all . Okay . And you say ? I don 't know . Neither do I. I only know that I think about you . All the time . So much , I can 't sleep . I don 't want to be like this . It may end up with me handing you over and shutting you off forever . If you 're tired of me , just let me go . How would you get by , out there ? I 'm quite good looking . - You 're a hubot . - Yes , yes ... I own you . Do you remember who you were before we changed you ? Do you remember ? You know I can 't remember that . You weren 't the cheapest trainer model they had , but ... Do what you want . Just don 't turn me off . Look , I can 't find my wallet . Can you just wait and I 'll go in and get some money ? No problem . The phone and the wallet . It must have been the man I bumped into . - What man ? - Just as I was leaving . We need to report this and freeze your cards . He took my phone . Where 's the phone ? What ? Inger . The phone ! It 's them . It happened just as I left . - What about the phone ? - I recorded our conversation . - What 's going on ? - This is not good . Inger , what 's not good ? - We have to get Anita to safety . - What will happen to Anita ? I don 't understand a thing , don 't ask me . I can 't get it to add up . We met at the Real Humans meeting , we hated hubots and all along you ... Yes . Why ? Because I wanted to be one of you . A real human that can love , have a family , a home . Is that so strange ? Is it ? No . I love you . - How can you ? When you 're a ... - A machine ? I am who I was yesterday . I am in you , you are in me , more alive than that it doesn 't get . No . You 're an amazing person , Roger . The most beautiful person I ever met . - We will never leave each other . - No . Promise . I promise . - When you get old I will take care of you . - Same here . I won 't get older than this . Roger . - Shit ... - Don 't you see it ? - Yes , Malte , it 's ... - Shit , don 't you see it ! ? - Yes , yes , I see it . Malte , I can explain . Malte ! Shit ... - Oh , shit ! - I can explain . What the hell is this ? What the fuck ! ? Take them away ! Roger , take them away ! Take them away ! These are my friends . Didn 't you say that you should help your friends , take care of your friends ? Take my hand . Take them away , Roger ! Sit . Welcome ... to our home .

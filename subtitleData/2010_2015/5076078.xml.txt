 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Whatever the effects of the Astrolabe , I 'm afraid it 's caused Arthur to have some sort of psychotic break . Artie killed Leena . He 's been whammied , just like we 've all been whammied at some point . We 're reinstating you as soon as possible . We see no need for punishment at this juncture . You can 't be serious . She died by my hand . And you will have to live that . How many errant static electricity balls are there ? Here comes another one . Bring it , electric boogaloo . Okay , drop it on the battery . Score one for some Indian dude whose name I can 't even pronounce . Okay , Vyasa wasn 't some dude , he was the author of the Vedas . Yeah . The oldest sacred texts ever written on basis of Hinduism . Never read them , I 'm waiting for the Bollywood version . Now , how many more sparkles we got left ? You know what , don 't ask me questions that you don 't wanna know the answers to , okay ? Pete . Hope this bad boy can handle four at once . Good job . Whoa ! Oh . Whoa ... Mykes ! I don 't think that bad boy does four . This is not my fault ! We could talk about blame later . You 're so gonna blame me ! Myke , you 're in black and white ! You are in black and white ! I am not ! I 'm in black and white . Oh , my God ! Our clothes , our clothes , they 're like ... It 's like 1940s . Oh , come on ! Not time travel again ! No , no , it 's not time travel . The 1940s were in color , much like the rest of history . All right , then where are we ? I don 't know . Okay ! It 's Chicago in olden times . Okay , okay , uh ... Focus , uh ... Retrace the steps ... Right , I had the , uh , the elephant ... It shot lightening up into the stacks ... Right , and then it was , it was raining manuscript ... Pages ! Manuscript pages . All those pages were blank . Not all of them , look . Okay , I 'm gonna go with , no , that is not a good title . I loved Anthony Bishop . He was a ' 40s crime novelist . Hard-boiled . I read every single one of his books when I was a kid . Okay , so did you read Kiss Me Forever ? No , that was his last one . I don 't think he ever finished it . Well , that would explain the blank pages . Well , he went insane from writer 's block and then ... Killed himself . Turning the manuscript into an artifact . Swell . Are you sure this is a good idea ? He 's been at that piano for days , it 's not healthy . Also , I 'm sick of that tune . It 's gonna be hard to trick Artie . Please , I always got the lead at the psycho-dramas at the institution . Action . I 'm telling you it 's a Ping . And I 'm telling you it 's a burglary . Classic cars are vanishing from locked garages without a trace . Burglary . This one guy who had a ' 52 DeSoto on display in his living room like a trophy . Now , a burglar would have had to take it apart piece by piece to get it out . If something was hinky , I 'm sure Artie would know , he 's the Ping king . Isn 't that right , Your Majesty ? It 's probably worth checking out . Don 't forget your neutralizer . Nah , sounds like a waste of time . Yeah , I mean , the car was found with clean VIN numbers , uh , at a dealer in Sioux Falls . There 's lots of ' 52 DeSotos . Yeah , but this one had a ' 53 hood emblem , makes it one of a kind . It 's not one of a kind . It 's flawed . If cars are literally vanishing , it is an artifact . File . Clearly , I stand corrected . Oh , mark the date . Keep your Farnsworth handy , in case I need research when I 'm in the field . What ? Wait , wait , wait . You 're going without us ? I can handle a simple snag and bag . Yes , of course , you can , but ... We should go with you . Why ? Uh ... We 'd miss you . We 'd miss ... A chance to learn from the master . The Ping king ! Also ... Safety in numbers . Doesn 't he always say safety first ? Yeah , I 've heard him say that , yes . We wanna see the cool hot rods . Yeah . All right , we 'll take Scarlet . What ? You named your new car ? You wear torn clothing , we all have our quirks . So ... How 's my acting ? I 'm not gonna lie to you ... Any luck ? I must have run for 10 blocks . The black and white goes on forever . Everything smells like fudge . What 's our next move ? Pete . I know my next move . I hear you 're the best in town . I like what you hear . Please , I didn 't know where else to turn . My husband has disappeared and I think it has something to do with this . Look what else made the trip . So , Ms ... Carson . Mrs. Rebecca Carson . Mrs. Carson , how can we help you ? Thank you , you 're very kind . I would love a cup ofjoe . Sorry ? I think Mrs. Carson would like you , my secretary , to get her a cup of coffee . If it 's not too much trouble . Two sugars in mine , doll . Oh , I 'll put a little extra something in yours , doll . So your husband likes elephants ? Oliver was an archeologist . He found this jade relic in India . He said it had magical powers . Hmm . Magical powers . Yes . He was terrified it might end up in the wrong hands and ... Now he 's gone and I 'm ... I 'm just so ... I 'm frightened . What I mean ... Relax , toots , Lattimer here is the best shamus in town . Thank you . I 'm a what now ? Excuse us a sec , will you ? Yeah . Myka , how does someone else have our artifact ? I dropped it before we got sucked in here . Well , it must have gotten pulled in with us . And you and I fell into the roles of private detective and his gal Friday . Secretary . His gal Friday . Well . Or you consult this case by yourself , while I make coffee . Our artifact is what this story is about . The case of the mystic jade elephant . Exactly . Myka , if this manuscript got turned into an artifact because of Bishop 's writer 's block ... And now we have a case to solve . Maybe the way to escape is to do what the writer couldn 't do . And finish the story . And if " finish the story " means " find an artifact , " then that 's good , because that 's what we do . Except we don 't have any of our tools here , okay ? We don 't have any goo , we don 't have a Tesla , we don 't have any Warehouse backup . Yeah , but we got one thing going for us . What 's that ? Nobody finds artifacts like we do , doll face . Lady . You got yourself a gumshoe . You see here , sir . Ferrari F430 convertible . Yeah , what 's that ? Lamborghini Countach . Yeah . And ... '67 Mustang Fastback . Yeah , this place is definitely moving cars . It 's nice . Commission-chaser at nine o 'clock . Hi . I 'm Amy . So I see you 're looking at the Mustang here . You 've got a good eye . Well , it is a V8 ... We 're not here to buy , sorry . Well , then , you wanna sell a car ? Excellent , because we 're always looking ... No , we 're not selling either . Oh , window shoppers . You know , I always say , if you 're looking ... Just take us to the owner . Please . Grand theft auto , fraud , aiding and abetting . You can do serious jail time . Or you could cooperate and tell us how you 're stealing cars from locked rooms . Of course . And you could cooperate by showing me your warrant . That 's really how you wanna play this ? It really is . Fine . Artie , no ! What the hell is that thing ? Does your insurance cover active ray gun ? 'Cause we 're gonna shoot every car in here . He 's not lying . Whoa , whoa , okay , okay , okay ! I 've got a guy , he gets me any car I need . It 's like magic . What 's his name ? I never met him . I wire money into a Cayman account with car requests . I 'm not giving you my password . Passwords just slow me down . What else can you tell us about this phantom thief ? Nothing . I get an anonymous email telling me where to pick up my car . You 're no help here . Stealy McThieferson 's just sitting on his money . No way to track him until he makes a withdrawal . We 're gonna have to identify target cars in the area . Or we could get him to come to us tonight . Mr. Lambeth ? Oh , please , don 't shoot my cars . No , no , no , we need you to make a request for a very specific car that 's only in town for tonight . Very good , Jinksy . Oh , Scarlet . Dame said the last place she saw her husband was his office . She may have said more , but I was too busy staring at her dabs . The only thing stopping them from going on forever was the floor . Petey , are you narrating ? No , I 'm just getting into character . When other people are around . Besides , this isn 't a cheesy movie . This is an Anthony Bishop novel . Hey , noir films are awesome . Yes , but Bishop 's novels are superb . They had an elegance , a beauty . Myka Ophelia Bering , are you actually enjoying this ? No , I had a dog , it doesn 't mean I wanna be trapped in one . Hello , handsome . Pete , wake up . Pete ! This book hurts . Welcome to the Indigo Club . My club . I must apologize for the manner in which you were escorted here . The boys can be a tad overzealous . Sure . Untie us and we 'll call it jake . Of course , after you tell me why you were at Mr. Carson 's office . We were looking for dope on who snatched him . I guess we found it . No , Pete , he 's looking for Carson , too . Aren 't you , Mr ... Barnabas , Caspian Barnabas . You 're quite astute for a woman . I went to college . I bet you did . You 're after the jade elephant , aren 't you ? There is such a thing as too smart . You wanna know a secret ? I am awash with anticipation . Your goons went easy on me , 'cause I 'm a dame . Mmm-hmm . They should have tied my ropes tighter . Now , untie him , you big Jasper . Jasper . Ha-ha ! Nice . What 's it mean ? There 's been a terrible misunderstanding . Yeah , you misunderstood how kick-ass my partner can be . This club is merely a hobby . I am , by vocation , shall we say , a procurer of rare and valuable artifacts . Oh , yeah ? Us , too . Excellent ! Kindred spirits . I hired Mr. Carson to find the elephant . But , alas , once found , he decided to retain ownership . Why do you think that is ? What motivates any man . Greed . I bet you know all about that . I paid him . That means I am the owner of the jade elephant and the wronged party in this sordid tale . Yeah , tell that to my aching jaw . Again , my sincere regrets . Here , a retainer to find my elephant . Oh , please , dude , we already have ... Eggs in the coffee , boss . Come on , this will be duck soup . You are enjoying this . Carson may be our only lead , but this place has already been tossed . Barnabas ' goons must have missed something otherwise he wouldn 't have hired us . And you took his money . Why ? We 're gonna need something , some cash while we 're trapped in here . Kristie Anne ... What ? Is that like Jasper ? Anthony Bishop , the author , his mother 's name was Kristie Anne . Yeah , so ? So ... All right , so the goons would never know that . It 's a plain old match box to them and unintended clue for us . Mmm-hmm . You 're quite astute for a woman . I need your guest book and no questions . You got that , ace ? Pete , it 's the ' 40s , you could have bribed him with $ 5 . Man , I want change from that C-note , see ! He 's not coming back , is he ? Someone 's erased an entry . Oh , I think I got his one . What ? Raymond St. James did it in Dark Memento . Augustus Pitt Rivers , 204 . That is a noir name if I ever heard one . Pete , Augustus Rivers is a real archeologist . And our missing Mr. Carson is an archeologist . He must be using " Rivers " as his alias . That remind you of anything ? I 'd say there 's a jade elephant in the room . Pete . The window . Carson ! Carson 's still got the elephant . I don 't think so . This is Oliver Carson . And he 's dead . All right , well , whoever killed Carson has the elephant . Either way , we don 't . Pete , this isn 't just a story about a missing relic . If Carson 's dead , we 're in a murder mystery . Great . Now , we 've got to find the missing dingus and put the finger on whoever rubbed out Carson or we 're locked up in crazy town forever . Why couldn 't we have fallen into a cookbook ? " Classic car buff Artie Weisfelt bids a fond farewell " to this 1964 convertible before it leaves for its new home , " Sinsheim Germany 's Auto and Technik Museum . " Uh , hey , some nice shades . They 're hiding his tears . This is great . Hotel 's name is clearly visible , so the thief will know exactly where to find it . Lambeth sent this link with the money . So all we have to do is wait for the thief to show up . Okay . Oh , my God ! Tell me you are not messing with one of my Tesla grenades . I 'm not messing , I 'm making some improvements so I can increase the blast radius . Okay , you know what ? First of all , you don 't improve perfection . You turn up the blast on this and it goes from stun to fry . Yeah , well , I 'm not taking any chances if we have ... And second ... A subtler plan . Oh . You made a GPS tracking device . Yes , I did . That 's very impressive . It says my car is in Spain . What ? Brilliant plan ... Okay , your ... Your little trick with the Tesla grenade must have bumped it to a different frequency . This is my fault now ? I forgive you . Nothing you can break that I can 't un-break . Just let me know when you get the signal . All right . This is very cool . If Bishop couldn 't solve his own murder mystery , how are we supposed to ? No idea . But if we don 't , we 'll be trapped in black and white forever . Great . And I just got a good base tan . Any chance you wanna tell Mrs. Carson her husband is dead ? Oh , I 'm just a secretary . Oh , fine , 'cause blondes dig me . Maybe she 'll want me to console her . Please don 't . We need her to tell us something she may have forgotten , even if it 's insignificant . Can I help you ? Yeah . We 're working for Mrs. Rebecca Carson , is she home ? I 'm sorry , who are you ? Mrs. Carson hired us to find her husband . May we speak with her ? Is this a joke ? I 'm Rebecca Carson . I 'd say that 's significant . I never thought he 'd turn up at all . And how 's that ? I assumed I 'd never see him again . After he took all my money and ran off with that peroxide blonde . Can you tell us anything about her ? She has terrible taste in men . A name would be more helpful . All I know is he met the little round heels at the Indigo Club . Oh , that joint again . Say , Mykes , when was the last time I took you dancing ? Thanks , pal . So it 's got to be the blonde , right ? She beat us to Carson , killed him , and took the artifact . Or she 's working for Barnabas . On the other hand , why would she hire us to solve a crime that she committed ? It 's a good plot device . Pete . Someone 's not happy to see us . Nobody 's been happy to see us . The ' 40s were rude . Well , surprise , surprise . Yowza ! Talk about a triple threat . We 'll grab her after this song . Yeah , yeah , we 'II , uh , we 'll blend . Keep a low profile . This is keeping a low profile ? Well , everyone is either dancing or drinking . And drinking isn 't an option . Detective Lattimer , you cut a rug . Even though I 'm incredibly manly , it doesn 't mean I ain 't got no rhythm . Six o 'clock . If he killed Carson , he is one cool customer . Yeah , and the hooch slinger with the evil eye has lost interest in us . That canary , that 's one dame we know for sure ain 't on the square . Hands . Sorry , Mykes , it 's a force of habit . She just made us . Yeah . And instead of going for an encore , looks like she 's going for a powder . Let 's go . Good evening , Mrs. Carson . Yes , I lied . If I 'd have told you the truth , you wouldn 't have helped me . Well , now we 'll never know , will we ? Now what 's your real name ? Lily . Lily Abbott . Please , I wasn 't trying ... Cut to the chase , Lil . You admit to killing Carson , tell us where the elephant is we 'll make sure you don 't get the chair . I didn 't kill Carson , I was here , rehearsing . It 's time to start singing , sister , and I don 't mean no love song . I never meant for any of this to happen . I 'm not a bad girl . That 's a baloney sandwich and you know it . Let me guess . You 're a small-town gal caught up in the wrong crowd . Now you 're in over your head and all you want is a way out . Disappear and leave this life behind . Is that the picture ? How did you know that ? I 've heard that tune a hundred times . Same song , different key . Now sing me the chorus . Though you already know half of it . Humor me . I 'll even start . Barnabas has you under his thumb . He made me get close to Mr. Carson . To keep an eye on him while he searches for the jade elephant . Get close , huh ? Is that ' 40s talk for " have sex with " ? How dare you ? I am a lady ! When Oliver double-crossed Mr. Barnabas , I knew he was a goner . That 's why I hired you . To keep him safe . You fell for Carson . I felt bad for Carson , but I didn 't love him . I have a man and we 're gonna run away from all of this . Sure you are , kitten . Please ! Please , you 've gotta help me . Oh . Save it for the coppers . You have been dying to play that scene , haven 't you ? Since I was 12 . Yeah . And I have to recalibrate the whole thing . What was Artie thinking ? He knows that he can 't mess with the Tesla ... Oh , he can 't hear me , can he ? That is correct . What 's correct . What she saying ? Nothing about you . Okay , this could be our guy . Tell her to get of there . Claud , get out of there before the thief sees you . Come on , come on , come on , Claudia . Get out of there ! Calm down ! I 'll fix it en route . Look , Artie , she has a plan , you 've been overreacting all day ! We 'll use Claudia 's computer and hack into the traffic cams and follow the car . Hurry ! Artie , your car drove through you . Are you all right ? I 'm fine ! But ... What were you thinking ? I was trying to save Claudia . How are you going to save Claudia by jumping in front of a moving car . No one else is dying on my watch ! Okay , she fixed the tracker . Let 's go . Do you mind opening the door ? Why would you rent the same car you already own ? I didn 't . I rented the same car that Claudia owns . Very cute . Does it also tuck you in at night ? Tell me you didn 't fall for Lily 's act . I don 't know . It makes sense . Barnabas kills Carson , grabs the elephant . Pete , don 't be fooled by a pretty face and a bad dye job . Excuse me , are you the private dick ? Ah , why , yes . Yes , I am . Mykes , did you notice how I didn 't make a joke there . I think I 'm maturing . Look at this . That 's gotta be a trap . No . Whoever wrote this , we need to talk to them , right now . Mykes , Mykes , hey ... Myka ... I don 't know how you got in here , but you better take to the air . What do you mean how we got in here ? We used the front door like everyone else . No , he 's not talking about the club , he 's talking about the book . So you 're a real person , too ? Pete , this is Anthony Bishop , the author . Oh , my God ! I 'm Myka Bering , I 'm a big fan ! I 'm flattered , Miss . Now drop this case , or I 'll shut both your private eyes for good . How 'd you know it was me anyway . The handwriting on your cocktail napkin , it matched the notes on your title page of your book . My manuscript . How did you get in here ? Oh , man , you wouldn 't believe it ! How did you get in here ? I just ... Oh , what 's it matter ? Please , Mr. Bishop , it 's important . Well , if you 're a fan , then you know how I dedicate every book . " With love , to my love . " They 're all dedicated to your wife . Right ? Something happened to her . It happened so fast . One day she was sick , then she was gone . I threw myself into a new novel , wrote a few chapters . And then ... Well , story was wrong . My wife was all I could think about . I 'd sit in front of my typewriter and close my eyes and I 'd imagine this world . Then one day , I open my eyes , I was here . So it wasn 't writer 's block that created the artifact , it was ... Grief . Yes , but our way out is still the same , Mr. Bishop , in order for us to get out of this world we need to , well , we think we need to finish your story ... Yeah , yeah , just tell us who did it . We 'll bring him to justice , grab our elephant , bingo-bango , and we all go home . No , I don 't want this story to end . Stop trying to solve it . It was you . You erased Carson 's alias from the hotel register , didn 't you ? Why ? Mr. Bishop , what 's here for you ? Not what , Mykes , but who ? I saw you looking at Lily . You 're in love with her . You stay away from Lily . She 's special , she 's ... She 's based on your wife . Look , Mr. Bishop , we just want to get out of here , okay ? What 's that have to do with Lily ? All of his books end with someone innocent dying in a shootout . In this one , it 's supposed to be Lily , isn 't it ? That 's why you couldn 't finish your story . I couldn 't save her in the real world , but I will in here . So back off ! Quit waving that iron around , you big palooka . You 're a writer , not a killer . Pete ... Well , maybe not , but I can stop you from ever finishing this story . I won 't lose her again , see . You 're in this book for good . Mr. Bishop ! See , this is why I don 't read . Pete ! Come on . Barnabas is our only lead . We 're not safe here anymore , darling . We 've gotta skip town . Where will we go ? Let 's go there . Bora Bora ? It 's just a daffy dream . Oh , it 's a dream I can make come true . But we gotta go tonight . It takes a lot of clams to get to Bora Bora . Hmm . Say , toots , you seen Barnabas ? He got a phone call and he dusted out . Left me a lousy nickel . But I could keep you company . Till he gets back . Rain check , sweetheart . I promise . Hmm . Great . They don 't have star 69 or caller ID in the ' 40s . And this ... Is why you should watch movies . Operator ? Say , doll , what 's your name ? Doris ? Ah , I love that name . No , no , I really do . Let me guess . Sultry voice , intoxicating laugh , you 're a redhead . No , what do they say about redheads ? Jeepers ! I 'd like to find out if that 's true . Say , Doris , maybe you can help me out . Any chance you listened in on the last call ? Maybe , I don 't know , something about an elephant ? Ah ! Brains , too . You 're the whole package , Doris . Thanks , doll . You would have done great in the ' 40s . Charm is timeless . Or women got smarter . Hello , Sparky . Hello , artifact . Window shopper . Are you sure this is the place ? According to my new pal , Doris , he was buying an elephant on the Fourth Street bridge , and I quote , " I know ! It 's weird , ain 't it ? " Pete , it looks like we 're too late . Electric burns , just like Carson . Pete , look at that . Those scratches , they look like they were made by fingernails . Yeah , long ones . Looks like he 's been attacked by a woman . Mykes , look at this . Barnabas fought back . Myka , we know a woman with long black hair . A woman who knew Carson well enough to know where he 'd hide out . Yeah , who was really pissed about her husband abandoning her . Rebecca Carson , the jilted wife ! Man , can 't anyone in a Bishop novel be trusted ? Rebecca , wait ! Don 't do this ! I loved Oliver . Until he found this stupid elephant . And dumped me for some dopey dame with a voice . What about Barnabas ? Did he deserve to die , too ? Yes , Barnabas was loaded with dough . He promised to pay for the elephant . And decided he could just take it . So you killed Carson , because he had it . You killed Barnabas , because he wanted it . Now you 're gonna kill me , just for looking at it ? You said it , sister . Pete ? Pete , come on , wake up . Pete ! Pete ! Pete , come on , wake up ! Pete ! God , didn 't CPR work in the 1940s ? Thank God , you made it ! That would have been a lousy ending . Did you get the elephant lady ? No ! I decided to stick around and bring you back to life instead . Right . Good choice . Thanks . Mykes , she 's gonna need some dough if she 's gonna skip town . Rebecca thought Barnabas had loads of it . Pete , the Indigo Club . Let 's beat it ! Tony , that 's not enough scratch to get us to San Diego , much less Bora Bora . Relax , Lil , I know the combination to this safe . And Barnabas has got plenty . You better know the combination . Get me that cabbage . It 's all that 's keeping your little chippy alive . I 'll fry you both before you can pull the trigger . Nice scam , saleslady ! Stealing cars and trying to sell them back to your boss . Cars deserve to be driven , okay ? People who lock them up like trophies don 't deserve them . Sounds like stealing to me , but who am I to judge ? I 'm about to steal those gloves from you . Claudia ! Are you all right ? I 'm going to be sore tomorrow . This place is locked up tight . We 'll never get out of here in time to catch up to her . Oh , Steve of little faith . Snagged one during the fight , because I 'm awesome . Okay , now , she could ... You know what ? She could make one glove work , I want to see if this is safe . Artie , what are you doing ? Old man totally tricked us . Oh ! To be fair , he wasn 't lying . You and your loogan just made a trip for biscuits . Now I 'm putting you in a wooden kimono . That 's not even English . Doesn 't matter , because this is over . You let Rebecca walk out of here , so she lets Lily go . Or you both die . The dame already fried two people , Bishop . The first chance she gets , she 'll drop you both into deep freeze . I 'll take my chances . Tony , are you bananas ? They 're on our side . Shut your trap , you dumb broad ! Scram or I throw lead ! You don 't wanna lose someone you love . I get it . But this literally has to end . No , my life is here now . With Lily . Tony , I love you . But if you think I 'd let you hurt anybody just to save me , well ... You don 't know me at all . You 're just like her . Pure and sweet . And usually right . I know . I love you , baby . You 're all I care about . Well , save it for the boat ride . Bishop , there 's no way that Rebecca is a real person trapped in here , too , is there ? No , I based her on my mother-in-law . Well , you 'll like this , then . Now that 's hard-boiled . The gloves belong to Carey Loftin . He did all the stunt driving on Vanishing Point Bullet . That 's why they only work on cars . He was a one-take wonder . He got every stunt the first try and never got a scratch on his car . Loftin must have endowed the gloves with the ability to make any car untouchable . What is that noise ? All right , it looks like the gloves can make any car untouchable , but just once . Hence , the one-take wonder . So your cars are crashable now ? Don 't worry , I 've got a plan . Oh , God ! Artie , what are you doing ? I 'm charging her . She 'll get scared . She 'll brake . But what if she doesn 't ? Artie , what if she doesn 't stop ? Artie ! Ha ! Yeah ! See , this wasn 't my first drag race . His first field mission in a while was bound to have some hiccups . He 's fine . Right . Okay , so why are we still here ? 'Cause we didn 't bring the killer to justice ? In a noir , a bullet is justice . Hey , Mykes . What ? I think I 'm getting some black-and-white vibage . I 'm working a hunch here , but just ... Cross everything you got , sweetheart . Nice . How did you know that the fog would be our ride home ? It 's the end of Casablanca . Stole that from Bishop , you know . And here he comes . Guess they stole the tearful goodbye , too . I don 't understand . We love each other . We can go to Bora Bora now . I can 't stay . I 'm not from this world . It 's hard to explain . Believe me . I don 't want to go . Then stay with me . Be good , kid . What would happen if he stayed ? The story is over . I don 't know if you get your happily ever after or you just fade away . One more second with her is a happier ending than a lifetime without her . Okay , now , that is a good line . All right , all right , I 'll read the books . Go ahead . I know you want to . So the detective and his ... Intrepid gal Friday . The detective and his gal Friday walked off into the fog . And left the lovers in their embrace . An embrace that would last forever . Maybe . Just maybe . Okay . That was , um ... What was that ? That was the stuff dreams are made of , sweetheart . And also painful . Really , really painful . All the pages have writing on them now . We finished the story . It 's just that jumping in front of a speeding car with Claudia in the trunk and playing chicken with the car thief , Artie wasn 't just putting himself in danger , it was everyone . I know that he says that he was following his gut , but I 'm afraid that he 's being unnecessarily reckless and I 'm really worried about him . Thank you for your candor . We 've been worried about Agent Nielsen as well . This confirms our fears . What does that mean ? It 's time for the Regents to act . When you asked me to keep an eye on Artie , you said it was to help him . Trust us , Agent Jinks . Wait a second , Mr. Kosan . I know what it 's like to go through trauma . And the last few months are not something that Artie will get through easily or quickly . We need to be there for him . Not bronze him or turn him into some H.G. Wells hologram . Noted , Agent Jinks . The less you know , the better it is for Agent Nielsen . As I say , trust us . " He 's very dashing . " I am dashing , aren 't I ? What ? " With a big dopey grin " ? I don 't have a dopey grin . What ? Don 't bogart the end . Pete , listen to this . " It was long trip , but it was worth it to see the look " on Lily 's face when she pressed her toes into the sand of Bora Bora " for the first time . " Neither of them had even seen water this blue . " She smiled brighter than the tropical sun . " It made him happier than he 'd been in a long time . " Good for Bishop . Yeah . But ... You know , a warm , fuzzy ending doesn 't really make sense for a gritty crime novel . Well , maybe that 's why he had writer 's block . He didn 't realize he was writing a love story .

 Previously on Alphas ... Gary and I just found something that is huge . Stanton Parish . This is from the Civil War . He was about 40 years old , right ? Same guy , a hundred years later ... War ... It 's inevitable . In two years , maybe three . Nothing that you or I can do to stop that . Bill , you all right ? It 's too early . Come back to bed and warm me up . In fact , you know what ? Why don 't we both call in sick ? Then you can ... No . I 've got to go to work . Bill , you need a break . You 've been so stressed and those pills are not working anymore . Jeannie , I ... I got this . Okay ? I got to go . Gary ? Breakfast . In a minute . Sounds to me like a cathartic release , Sandra . It releases the tension , and some stress . It 's basically a coping mechanism . No , it 's happening every day , Lee . That 's not coping . They locked him up . They put a metal chip in his head , for God 's sake . He 's gone back to work way too soon . Sandra , Gary needs to work . It 's good for him . You know that . He really needs to talk to somebody about what happened to him . Listen , I 'm on my way to pick him up now . I 'll find some time today to speak with him . I mean , you know that I love my parents to death . But they 're all over me again . I mean , all of a sudden it 's like , " Where are you going ? " How late are you gonna be at work ? Mmm-hmm . " Are you being safe ? " They need to understand that I 'm an adult and that I 'm gonna do what I want to do . I 'm gonna do what I want to do . Yeah . Exactly , Gary . Well , then , perhaps you should look into getting your own apartment again ? Yeah , I 've thought about it , but after everything that happened last year ... Nathan , yes , what is it ? Yeah , what 's up ? What is that smell ? What happened ? I smell nice . I smell like a washing machine . No , it 's not you , Gary . Someone reeks of cologne . Hicks ? Please do that and we 'll talk about it ... What are you doing ? Oh , Harken . Hello , Rachel . Listen up , Old Spice , I will hose you down . What are you talking about ? You know , that 's not me . You 've got perfect timing . Meet John Bennett . This is Rosen 's new choice for our lead Tactical . Rachel Pirzad . Rachel . I 've heard a lot about you . What did you tell him ? Uh , I didn 't tell him anything . But if I did , I would 've told him all of the good stuff . So , you 're gonna be working here now ? Only on an as-needed basis , but , yeah . Well , on an as-needed basis , you need to know that your body spray or whatever , is ... It 's way too distracting . It 's not that you smell , exactly ... Rachel , Bill ? Hello , John . Welcome . Thank you , sir . Cley just called . An Alpha 's been killed . We need to go . Jack Duffy . Building Seven escapee . He can generate electricity with his bare hands . Looks like chemical burns . There 's an extremely high concentration of hydrochloric acid . Someone pour it on him ? No . More like spit it at him . The acid is mixed with the attacker 's saliva . So , you can smell this guy 's spit ? Hey , saliva has a very distinctive smell . That 's cool . It 's poison spit . Yeah . It 's like a cobra . I like that . He didn 't like it , though , because it melted his ... I 'm being inappropriate . Check out these hands . There 's skin under the nails . He definitely put up a fight . So , we 're saying another Alpha killed him . Rachel , there 's something written on his hand . Can you take a look at that ? Oh , yeah . That 's a phone number . 718 ... 555 ... 0012 . It 's voice-mail . " Delivery , 8 : 00 tonight . " 286 Crawford , Bolivia . " Bolivia ? What kind of delivery ? Didn 't say . No , Bill . There 's no Crawford in Bolivia . It 's not even Spanish . There 's a Christo in Caracas . Bill , would you take point on this , please ? Maybe you can find someone who knows what happened to Mr. Duffy . That 's what I do . Thanks . I need to keep looking for Parish . Gary , come with me , please . This is 286 Crawford . But this definitely isn 't Bolivia . A lot of heartbeats inside . People are yelling and cheering . Maybe it 's squatters . Happy squatters ? Rachel , do you smell that acid ? It 's hard to tell , um ... I need to get a closer look . No , no , no . The area 's not secure . We 're gonna go check it out . I 'll cover the street . You stay with me , okay ? What ? Yeah . Let 's go . Bill ... No , he 's Lead Tactical now , Rachel . Stay with him . Who are you ? 286 Crawford ? What about it ? Bolivia . So you 're a fighter . You got skills ? Wouldn 't be here if I didn 't . Well , we 'll see . Smooth talker . Well , it got us in here , didn 't it ? Yeah , into what ? Well , from the looks of things , this is probably where Duffy got that blood on his knuckles . We need to find out . Spread out . Hmm . You okay ? Yeah , I just ... I thought I caught a whiff of his scent . Well , what 's wrong ? What 's wrong is , John , is that you stink , okay ? My eyes are watering , my nose is burning . It 's like a spice rack exploded in my face . No , Rachel ! Rachel , you can 't go out there . I actually have to do my job , so , can you please just stay in the car ? Rachel . Thank you . Hicks , I can smell it . Hydrochloric acid . Can you narrow that down a little bit ? Not yet , it 's faint . The killer 's here . I 'm sorry . I thought , um ... You thought what ? Oh , wow , is that an acid burn ? It looks like it must 've hurt . Some piece of crap spit at me . Soon as he knew I could beat him . That piece of crap , what was his name ? Bazevich . You know , you 're pretty cute . What 's your name ? Hey ! Everything okay here ? Oh , yeah . Yeah , it 's good . Hey , um , the Bazevich guy , huh ? We came to see him fight . I 've been waiting for him all night . And when he shows , I will kick his ass . You come and watch that , huh , little girl ? Sweet guy . Tell me about it . You okay ? Yeah . Hey , thanks for not staying in the van . All right ! Yes ! Get up . Get up . You ! Hot shot ! Okay , no time outs . Last man standing gets the win . Your knee touches the ground , you lose . No , I thought I 'd just check it out first time . Yeah ? Well , you figured wrong . First-timers got to fight . Yeah ! Oh , yeah ! Don 't take no for an answer There 's no telling where we 've been Because people don 't understand , understand , understand People don 't understand People like me Probably thinks he 's a tough guy . Trust me , short stack , he is . He 's gonna get his ass kicked . Yeah , right . What 's the problem , old man ? Son of a bitch is all over the place . I can 't hit him . You see that , dude ? He messes with your eyes , like a camera flash going off in your face . He makes you see all double and triple . Yeah ? How 's he do that ? He 's got a special talent . All the fighters do . They 're Alphas . Stanton Parish . Jacob Dunham . Jacob Dunham , Stanton Parish . There 's no connection . Jacob Dunham , Stanton Parish . Gary , how are you doing ? You tired ? You 've been at this all day . Yeah . I 've been at it all day and I 've found bupkis , that means nothing . It 's like zilch . I 've found zilch . That 's not entirely true . You found that this picture is of a Major Jacob Dunham ... And he was treated by a Dr. Harrison , who worked at New York Hospital . Yeah , yeah . You know , I 'm thinking that if he had continued to treat Major Dunham , his notes might still be there in the hospital records . Well , Gary , I hear that you 've added a new element to your morning routine . You 're screaming . Okay , yeah . I scream for 10 seconds . But then , then I go and have my breakfast . So , you 're not frightened about anything . Are you angry about something ? It might help if you discuss it . No , I don 't want to discuss it . I scream so we don 't have to discuss it . Right . I see . You know , you have every reason to be angry . The government took you away from your home . And put a chip in your neck ... They killed her . What ? They killed her , Anna . They shot her in the head . She was my friend . Gary , it 's a healthy thing to express yourself . And I 'm glad that you are . Maybe you can find a way to do it without terrifying your mother ? Yeah , okay . Bill ! You okay ? No , I 'm not . Don 't worry about it . What you got for me ? Rachel got the name of our acid-spitter . Ivan Bazevich . Did a stretch upstate . No known address . So how do we find him ? Well , we know he 's a fighter . Hey . Heard things got pretty rough last night . Things get rough every night . So , when 's the next fight ? For you ? Never . You ain 't cut out for this . Hey , wait . I 'll work with him . This guy , Kat ? Guy 's got moves , he just doesn 't know how to use them . Give him another shot . For you , fine . But I don 't see it . Hey , so , I know all their tricks , so if you want to win next time , give me a call . I 'm Kat . So , why would you want to help me out ? So I can bet on you , cash in . Okay . Later . What 's all this ? Doctor Rosen said that I should find a way to scream without terrifying you , so I did . I 'm moving out . What ? Yeah , I 'm gonna go live at my office . What are you talking about ? Sandra , I know you 're upset but I did not recommend that Gary leave home . No , but that was your solution for Rachel . Why is it different for me ? Why is that not my solution ? Gary , you are not going anywhere . I want to do what I want to do . You know what ? You 're not going to work today , either . Yeah , Mom , come on , of course I 'm going to work . I go into work every day . They need me there . I need you here ! No , no ! You don 't need me . Go in the house . I 'm going to work . Gary , Gary it 's , uh ... It 's quite all right if you don 't come to work today . There 's nothing urgent and , uh , if we need you , we 'll call . And I think it would be a good idea if we all , uh , sat down very soon and discussed your future . My future . My future . Yeah . Yeah . We 're still focused on Bazevich as our killer . I finally got his records from DOD . Well , are we any closer to finding this guy ? The cops have been by all his usual hang outs . No sign of him . Harken 's checking a lead , but , look , if you ask me , these Alpha fights are still our best bet . Yeah , just as long as it 's a stakeout and no more fighting . I wasn 't the one fighting . To be honest with you , I don 't know if we can keep him away . I mean , the guy is in training right now for his next fight . The human nervous system of the body sends and receives , while also processing , neurological impulses throughout our brain . It controls all physical and fine motor skills while also impacting our thoughts , emotions and cognitive functions . The spinal cord serves as a telegraphic cable , sending various messages throughout the body . The spine itself measures approximately quarter of an inch in diameter , and varies in length from person to person . The synaptic impulses are responsible for all sense ... So , watch out for that guy , 'cause he 'll mess with your eyes . And then there 's this other guy , super flexible . You punch him , he pops right back . So you got to drive him into a corner . That way he springs back and forth against your fists . What about , um , the guy that spits acid ? Bazevich ? Bad-ass . Scary as hell . Okay , pay attention . So you kickbox , too ? No . Never have . Yeah , but you just can 't pick that up right away . I 'm a quick study . Oh . You 're an Alpha . So are we done chatting ? We 've got a lot of work to do . Hi . Um , so , I raided the soap aisle . I figured while we 're on stakeout , you should get to at least choose how I smell . Which really sounded a whole lot better in my head . So , you actually went and bought all of these things ? Yeah , I mean , I thought about unscented , but I figured nothing 's really unscented to you . You 're right . There is no such thing as unscented to me . Tom 's of Maine is probably the mildest . Okay . And thank you . You 're welcome . Is that it ? I 'm not gonna amp up just for practice . It 's not healthy for me . Well , my bet is using your ability is not your problem . It 's holding back . You got all this pressure all the time . It 's building up . That 's why you get cranky . You have no idea what you 're talking about . Stop fighting who you are . Just let it go , man . What do you want me to do , huh ? Just sit on the floor , burn some incense , say " om " ? As much as I 'd like to see that , no . Harken , you need to relax . Just try to listen . Just trust me . Okay ? There 's no reason to struggle . There 's nothing to control . You don 't have to reach for it , because it 's part of you . When you want it , it 'll be there . Told you . Never thought we 'd have something so ancient . Dr. Harrison 's files were right there in the archives . This must be my lucky day . " It was two years ago , the 22nd of October , 1862 . " It was only my fourth week serving with General Wood 's Army of the Cumberland , " but I 'd already seen hundreds of men killed in battle . " Shot in the head . There 's nothing we can do for this poor soul . " Hundreds more maimed irreparably . " Sorry , son . His artery 's shredded . " None of that prepared me for meeting Jacob Dunham ... " Oh . Hey , Cameron . Hey , Doc . Um ... Are you busy ? Because I can come back . No , I 'm ... You know what ? Don 't worry . I 'll come back . No , no . Of course not . Come on in . Wow . Did you , uh , rob a library ? It looks that way , doesn 't it ? They 're Civil War documents . Right now I 'm reading a physician 's war diary . It 's pretty fascinating . Have a look . " The Journal of Doctor Zachary Harrison . " Any headaches ? None this week . You haven 't mentioned my name in any of those records , have you ? My descriptions remain anonymous , as we agreed . You weren 't quite this distrustful before you survived that bullet two years ago . Shall we ? It 's even faster now . You 're getting stronger . And with no scarring . It 's simply amazing . How 'd he pull off that little trick ? By using his Alpha ability . I think Dunham is Stanton Parish . Parish ? You really believe this guy 's been kicking around for two centuries ? Well , it is hard to fathom . But I think this incident is the first time he realized what he was capable of . How exactly does this help us catch him now ? Well , learning about his formative years might help us understand what drives the man . Hmm . As the old saying goes , zhi bi zhi ji bai zhan bu dai . Yeah , that old chestnut . That 's Sun Tzu . " Know your enemy like yourself . " And you may win 100 battles . " So , is there something you want to talk about , Cameron ? You know how much I respect you , Doc , and I just ... I wanted to let you know that , um ... I 'm in a relationship with Dani . I know . Well , Nina took it upon herself to make sure I knew . Well , isn 't that just perfect ? Well , I sort of knew already . It 's obvious , seeing you two together . So , as long as you make my daughter happy , you can keep your job here . I haven 't been myself of late I haven 't slept for several days You know you drive me up the wall Yeah ? Jeannie . Jeannie what are you doing here ? Uh , I mean , is everything okay ? Are you okay ? Yeah . I 've never felt better , actually , and without the pills . What you got there ? It smells good . I brought you some herb crusted chicken with scalloped potatoes . Are you hungry ? Am I hungry ? You want to know if I 'm hungry ? Mmm-hmm . Mmm-hmm . What ? Isn 't it ... Bill . What ? What ? What are you doing ? - What are you ... - Oh ! Gary , you can 't live in your office . You 've got to be practical . I am being practical . You won 't have to hear me scream every day . But you need to be safe . Yeah , it is safe . It 's safer . But I won 't have to drive to work anymore , 'cause people die in car crashes all the time . And Dr. Rosen , he forgets to signal a lot . And anyway , the building has security . So there , it 's more secure than this place . Don 't you tell me you support him in this . I think we both need to support Gary in whatever steps he needs to take towards his independence . But this is too big a step . For him or for you ? Let me get a turkey dog with everything . Coming up . And for you ? What do you want ? Uh , what do they taste like ? They taste like hot dogs . What do you mean ? You never had a hot dog before ? Yeah , I must have , right ? Um , yeah , I 'll just have the same thing . All right , give me two , please . Thanks . Here you go . Thanks . So you coming tonight ? Yeah ! There 's gonna be a boatload of people there with deep pockets , so you got to crush everyone so we can rake it in . Yeah , you need some of this here ... Peppers , and ... So what about , uh , Bazevich ? You think he 'll be there ? You got , like , a man crush on him or something ? How should I know if he 's coming ? How should you know ... I thought you knew everything about these fights . How 'd you get involved with them anyway ? Just kind of found myself there . These are amazing ! These are good . You like that , huh ? It 's good stuff . What do you mean you just found yourself there ? I ... I have this thing where I can 't remember anything that happened , like , more than a month ago . Like , a month from now , I won 't remember this , or you , or the hot dog . You serious ? Yeah . My brain 's wired to , like , make room for all the new crap I learn , you know ? Yeah , but what about your family ? Your home ? Well , home 's the fights , for now . You got to be careful . That 's a rough crowd . Don 't get all Papa bear on me , okay ? I 've been taking care of myself for ... Well , I can 't remember , but it 's been a long time . It 's got to be lonely , though . But it 's stupid , though . I don 't know why libraries do this . Dr. Rosen , it 's just a big waste of space . They could fit everything in here , just on one microchip . Inside voice , please , Gary ? What ? Inside voice , please . My inside voice is too quiet . Well , split the difference , then . We are fortunate this university preserved its newspapers . Jacob . This is a surprise . You 're making a presentation tonight . Your abilities are extraordinary . Cancel your presentation , Zach . Promise to never speak of what I can do . I can 't , Jacob . It 's too important to keep to ourselves . Crowd is hot tonight . Well , Rocky , try and remember why we 're here . Yeah , yeah , yeah . You see Kat anywhere ? Don 't worry about that kid . She can take care of herself . No , no , no , she can 't take care of herself . She forgets things . She could be lost or confused . I think she 's gonna be okay . I don 't think so . All right , all right , all right ! Let 's go , let 's go , let 's go ! Who is gonna start the show ? I will . No , no , no , man . We need a real fighter , all right ? Bring it on . All right , all right , all right ! We 've got some fresh meat now . Who is gonna be the challenger ? Rubber man ! Whoa ! What ? What ? Come on . I 'm gonna let ' em send you some flowers . All right , ladies and gentlemen , you know what time it is ? Time to place your bets ! Hah ! The noise , the noise , The noise , the noise The noise , the noise The noise ... Ahh ! Yeah , what 's up ? You don 't have to reach for it , because it 's a part of you . When you want it , it 'll be there . Unit One . Still clear . So , your dad and both sisters are in the military . Your brother 's a cop . You must have felt a lot of pressure to make certain choices about your life , huh ? Sounds like you can relate . I smell something . Seriously ? No . That SUV ... He 's not in there now , but Bazevich ... He was definitely in there . All right , all right , all right ! Who 's next ? I am . Oh , no , no , no . Surprise . You trying to play me , Kat ? Never said I wasn 't a fighter . There is gonna be some action tonight ! Place your bets ! Right now . Place your bets ! Kat , this isn 't a good idea . Harken , this isn 't personal . Shift your opponent 's weight to one leg and then attack the weighted knee . If you lack size , compensate with speed and precision . The brain is the most sensitive organ in the human body . The neurotransmitters are the most vulnerable near the brain stem , located at the base of the skull . Hey , hey , you all right ? Is he okay ? He 's awesome , yeah . Thanks . Hey , Harken . Harken . Not bad . Some people want to talk to you about a job . What kind of a job ? Well , I don 't know . They didn 't say , but I know they pay big . Hear them out . Let them buy you a drink . Okay . You all right ? Yeah . That 's that girl , Kat , from the other night . Bill ! Hicks ! Come on ! What happened ? You okay ? Ask him who did it . Hicks , I will kill you . Hey , listen ! We 've got a lead on Bazevich . He was in that car , and your friend Kat just got in there . Then let 's go . Come on . That 's their SUV . What the hell is this place ? Okay , Bazevich is inside . You can smell him ? Believe me , he 's unforgettable . Rachel , what 's going on in there ? There 's , uh ... There 's multiple heartbeats , An E.K.G. , respirators , hospital machines . The place is wired with sensor alarms . And there 's weaponry , heavy boots . Unit One to Tactical . Send backup to our position . Wait , it 's that girl , Kat . Let me go ! Her voice is weak . She 's fading . A male voice now . " Make sure she stays under . " They want to prep her right away . Prep her for what ? Harken , wait ! Damn it ! Kat ! Kat ! Harken ! Kat ! Kat ! - Hey ! - Bazevich . What are you doing ? Kat ! Hey ... Oh ! Kat . Harken ... You 're gonna be okay . Harken ! Good job . Is she okay ? Kat ... You okay ? I beat you . Yeah , you beat me . We need three ambulances and transport for prisoners to Binghamton . Transport . Gotcha . So that 's Bazevich ? The guy we 've been chasing for two days is a dead man . Hey , turns out Bazevich was a prisoner here , too . Poetic justice for killing Duffy , I guess . Can you believe it ? Experimenting on Alphas . More like treating us like animals . I could 've gotten out of there myself , you know . You know what ? You can just say , " Thank you , so much , Bill Harken , for rescuing me . " Does that work ? I kicked your ass once tonight . Do you want to go again ? Now , easy does it , young lady . You 're gonna have to take it easy for a while . You 've been through quite an ordeal . Just give me a couple weeks . I won 't remember . And I 'll want to have a look at you too , later . No , no . I 'm fine , I 'm fine . Look , I get to use my ability and feel no downside , so ... No downside ? No downside at all . Hey , Dr. Rosen , who are you guys , anyway ? So , Harken was undercover , right ? I wasn 't undercover . You were definitely undercover . And then you barged in with those guys . We 're consultants . We work with the government now and then in situations not unlike this one . You 're Alpha secret agents , right ? You 're Alpha secret agents ... You 're gonna be fine . Just take it easy . I 'm ... I 'm totally right . I 'm right , right ? You want me on your team . I 'm awesome . It 's the perfect soap . It 'll blend really well with your natural scent which , by the way , is really good on its own , anyway . So ... There . Thanks . Uh , I 'll try it . I was ... I was , uh , in the Village and I found it at this shop right next to my favorite restaurant , which is Italian . Cool . Do you like Italian ? Um ... look , Rachel , if we 're going to be working together ... Right . Forget I mentioned it . What can I get you ? Earl Grey tea , please . Okay . Hello , Lee . May I join you ? You made it very easy for me , Stanton . Or do you prefer Major Dunham ? I prefer Stanton . Thank you for providing Dr. Harrison 's research . So you 'd know how I began ? Yes , by murdering a friend . Dr. Harrison wanted to use me . So you sacrificed an innocent man . Have you ever sacrificed an innocent man ? Not intentionally . Every man must control his own destiny . I re-enlisted after the doctor 's death . I helped save the Union . Hmm . So you 're what ? Looking for the thanks of a grateful nation ? Just some understanding of my unique perspective . I was shot again at Cold Harbor , and again at San Juan Hill . I fought at Verdun , in the streets of Berlin ... Oh , a very impressive resume . Thank you . Every change brings bloodshed . We can stop that . And yet you say a war is coming . Because ... Ordinary men react with fear and violence to anything that 's new and different . You know , one of my favorite subjects in medical school was cellular research . Mmm-hmm . Examining the constituent parts of things . Trying to figure out how it all works together . It was very tedious , but it was exciting , because eventually I could see the whole picture . Try the tuna melt next time . It 's excellent . No , Mom , don 't do that . That 's how I like it . Yeah , but that 's the way you keep it at home . No . This is home . This is how I like it here . Right . Good night , Gary . Yeah , good night . Mom ? Where 'd you go ? I 'm right here . I 'll call you at 8 : 00 . After I scream but before I 've had my breakfast . I 'll answer . Yeah , okay . Well , look who 's back . Here to watch ? Hell no . I 'm here to fight .

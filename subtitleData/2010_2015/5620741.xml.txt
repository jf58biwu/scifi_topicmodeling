 In the distant future or perhaps in the distant past ... The human race has spread across the galaxy , founding colonies on distant planets . Their population increased , until it exceeded billions of inhabitants But resources were exhausted , the birth rate collapsed , and the human race is now in an era of decay A movement began that advocated a return to Mother Earth . But the planet did not support repatriation A huge conflict for the right to return started , known as " The Homecoming War " And a governmental structure was born , the " Gaia Coalition " , to end the war . The Gaia Coalition declared Earth to be " a sacred place " where no-one was allowed to enter . The planet became a symbol to view from a distance , even as the colonists on planets were dying out . There was , however , a man who resisted ... and continued to venture into the depths of space . A space pirate , immortal in the last century , and challenging warships of the Federation . Wanted by the Gaia Coalition , code S-00999 His name is - I always hate those youngsters ... It feels like they 're waiting for you to die . No doubt about that . This town 's a dump And the planet 's finished . It 's not the planet that 's finished , it 's us humans . At least I 'm finished ... An immigrant ship ... That vibration , isn 't it ... ? A battleship ! So do we , Leave this to the young guys ? It 's the Arcadia . Faster ! Hurry up ! It 's getting away ! The universe is so vast And Humanity so small ... But with a short-live blaze of glory And so this glorious moment begins anew , Which is not that simple . The Solar System ... Either going forward , into oblivion Or learning to go beyond what we can see We already know ... Humans are desperately alone . I heard you need additional crew members ! Recruit us ! We just need one . What are you here for ? Honor ! Money ! Freedom Your name ? Yama Just don 't forget that word It 's the trademark of the ship Ready to sail ! Go ahead Let Kei take care of the newcomer . Why me ? You took responsibility for him . Humanity is dying Hey hurry up and walk ! Even going forward is useless Nothing changes Still Man ... continues to move forward Cable enemy sensors found The MX201 is tracking an increasing amount of energy Warning ! Incoming object . It 's exceeded secondary space velocity 120 seconds before collision Dark Matter Energy detected It 's the fourth ship in the Death Shadow - The Arcadia ! Captain Harlock I will take command . Captain 's Orders . All hands to stations Move to your stations now ! Hey ! Don 't get in my way ! Those patrol ships are getting closer ... Excuse me What are you doing ? Where are the turrets ? Follow them . Straight ahead . Preparing ! DS class ship 1 Deploying fighters Alpha Commander . Launched for combat , engaging fighter fleet All pilots , the pirate target is armed with scattered gas Pirates are using these kinds of weapons ? All pilots , target from the top with rapid descend Concentrate the attack on the ship 's prow ! What ? There 's no damage ... Who 's controlling the turrets ? The newcomer , sir . Well , what do you know . Target retreating , turning 180 degrees No. 6 , No. 8 engines down to 12 % Captain ! Confirm communication ! It 's Agent F111 . Get on the Bayonet ! Hurry up to the hangar deck ! Come on , move it ! Gravity anchors are ready , aim them well Party time Don 't move . It 's an Optical Scanner It hurts . After 4-5 minutes it 'll wear off . You need to infiltrate and spy on Harlock and his crew Saved you . Don 't wander around without a hardsuit . The bridge is losing pressurisation , hurry Kei I know what I 'm doing . Hey , wait , Where are you going ? Acquiring target goods completed Changing to normal navigation It 's like we 're on a harvest . Attention , the Captain 's here ! We 're going to shake free of the Union 's pursuit . Activate the Dark Matter System ! Standby for further announcements . Roger that ! You heard the Captain , start the Dark Matter System ! It is reported that the MX patrol fleet , Was in contact with the pirate ship Arcadia . Agent F111 , Must continue his mission according to plan . That ship ... Will soon be in our custody . The outlaw has been terrorizing the universe for years . After 100 years the Gaia Coalition is still after that betrayer . He must be captured . The Gaia Fleet will try it 's best to capture him . Can you do it ? Yes sir . Ezra , The Head Commanders are very satisfied in your loyalty . It 's my honor sir . We 'll be waiting for your good news . His younger brother is an agent ? He needs to prove his loyalty to the Union It 's not that hard to serve Gaia Fleet What could possibly go wrong ? Someday we can set our foot on the road Luck can also be regarded as a compensation Nami Why , Ezra ? Why gave the task to Yama ? I trust him . He 's the perfect guy for this . Executive meeting will start shortly I understand . I 'm not interested in the army I want to be like my mother , as Plant Observers Unfortunately , while Arcadia is equipped with self-repair systems That section is permanently damaged Beyond this point Power from Dark Matter Energy is infinite Gathering of supplies is a troublesome thing This ship is all what we need . What 's Dark Matter Energy ? That ... 100 years ago , during the " The Homecoming War " An alien civilization called The Nibelung ... Developed a perpetual motion machine I don 't know how it works Only the Nibelung race can operate that thing She 's the last survivor . The only alien civilization to have ever had contact with humans Mutual understanding will be difficult Can I ask something , Mr. Yataran ? Sure . Is it true the captain is more than 100 years old ? Heroes do grow old ... And continue to explore the universe There are many who have a criminal record People like you . I ... I 'm very disappointed . Go back to what 's left of the Earth . Human lives are bleak When born in this era You can 't make people do what you want them to Am I right ? Due to above , the sound vibrations will be reported There 's nothing particularly unusual yet Although there 's no problem ... Well , get to the point ... Friends Soon ... Our long journey ... You 're here . The hour has come ... It 's for you to decide . Why did you let him aboard ? I understand now . Like what the others said Freedom I see something in him . Well then , Let 's see ... A " Gramm " class planet of the 8th galaxy Tuka Jia Block 99 is mounted on the planet What 's Block 99 ? It 's a Dimensional Oscillation Warhead Humans have abandoned this colonial planet This is more dangerous than your usual work Who will volunteer ? What 's the matter ? Are you guys scared ? I 'll go ... I 'm sorry but ... Regardless of what it is , he needs to prove himself . Be at the hangar deck in 10 minutes Why did you volunteer ? It was my dream to board that ship Everyone wanted to . Is that it ? I want the Captain to see my skills . This thing we 're going to , where is it ? Just wait and see . It uses camouflage . Dimensional Oscillation Warhead ... So this thing can provide all the energy we need . Pretty neat isn 't it ? Set coordinates of latitude 32 degrees 7 minutes Longitude 126 degrees 4 minutes Jim Dahl High Lands , east of the Wye valley at the southern end . Mark , please Coordinates confirmed Descending now . We 're initiating the task now . Watch out for corrosive gases . These are corrosive gases for detonation . We need to complete this in one hour . Just follow me . Kane is best for this environment . They are very useful here Some biologists studied their special abilities . What are they ? They can survive the gases without side-effects . That 's amazing . That 's why we start over . Start over ? Regardless of where we look in the universe . Aside from Earth ... They don 't let their fellow humans be identified as their own kind Everyone wants to go home However , due to the Gaia Coalition the Earth became " a sacred land " No-one is permitted to enter . Going back to Earth is not gonna be easy . Everyone said that humanity will soon come to an end . Humanity is scattered everywhere in the universe . Like a resurgence of species . At least the last time Did not want to do in their own lives Option One , Go back to the distant past ... The early days of human life But how ? The Junction Point will unlock the harness of time Where is it ? Somewhere in this universe there 's a place where time gaps are connected free from the shackles of causality , The universe from a continuous cycle of time . Freedom . But it needs a large amount of energy , We need to close the Gap in the universe ... The one that is untied That is ... If we deployed it in the universe ... 2 million vibration bombs would detonate simultaneously . It would unlock the " time of the end point " Well , I acted like a captain . The purpose of these bombs , I still don 't understand it What if what you just said proves wrong ... everyone might be in danger . I trust the Captain 's decision . though I don 't really agree with his goals . But we need to trust him . What 's going on ? I 've never felt this before Hurry ! Get back ! That 's not a rock formation but a Strata Serpent ! Oh , crap Are you okay ? I 'm okay . Let me go , I want to go back Don 't be a fool , do you want to die ? It was my fault it fell in There are corrosive gases in there . You will also get involved in it What about him ? Sometimes you have all the bad luck . No way ! Captain . They 're withered , also the trees . These species are not ready for Yama These flowers can only bloom on Earth . Mars is not suitable for mother 's dream . Yama Stop it ! Brother ! Brother Don 't come over Don 't come You 're like this ... Tell me brother What should I do ? Be my legs take my place , Walking , running in the battlefield That is your ... Retribution Captain you 're heading to the steam geysers ! The Strata Serpent is active . I need the Dimensional Oscillation Warhead to be in manual mode You noticed it , didn 't you ? As long as you 're on the Arcadia , you 're my crew . That idea was stupid . I 'm not here just to join your crew , My mission is to kill you ! Is this what you want to do ? The likelihood of survival is less than one ten thousandth of the task Even if you succeed no one will praise you . Only a fool would follow such orders . You 're on your own now . Why 's there been no contact yet ? There 's no signal on any of the radio frequencies . We can 't confirm if they 're still alive . Why did the Captain have to get involved ? We would do the same in his place . Trust in him . Captain , If you die ... I 'm not willingly doing this , I 'm not ... Freedom You said that when you boarded the Arcadia . That is ... If what you say is true , Fight against the shackles that bind you If that doesn 't kill me , Do it again . Maybe you can kill me . I wanted to give you 2 or 3 punches ... But forget it . What matters is that you returned home safely . Fight against the shackles that bind you ... So , now we 've managed to deploy a couple of the bombs , We can finally go to on our next target . 0 degrees galactic latitude ... Humanity 's Home . Earth Earth Earth Earth The Arcadia is heading towards Earth 's solar system , And is now underway Your Fleet has not contacted you . Communications are interrupted . Don 't let them get close to the Earth . Please allow us to use the " Kaleido Star System " I will destroy the Arcadia myself . " Kaleido Star System " ? Using collapsed neutron star material needs concentrated light energy . a resource contolled by the government . However , Harlock 's Dimensional Oscillation Warheads can destroy worlds His warheads need Junction Points . which are not readily available . Using the " Kaleido Star System " will ensure our victory . The last time it destroyed everything . Soldiers engaged in a never-ending war ? Your Lordship what 's your decision ? The use of the " Kaleido Star System " is permitted . Use all means to stop him . Even if it 's the best idea we 've got it 'll disrupt communications I 'm always prepared with battleplans Like intending to abandon him ? How can you do this ? Gaia Coalition Command Order to all warships of the Gaia Fleet Entire Fleet , make ready to sail Repeat , entire Fleet , make ready to sail Unlock all warships All ships , set systems ready for departure Once Fleet co-ordinates received Gejian Fleet , begin departure 45 minutes in the high-speed optical furnace . Re-fuelling completed . " Oceanus " . Configuration coordinate positioning now completed . I was Fleet Commander Lu Wali 's aide According to the orders of Commander Ezra The whole Gejian Fleet is to go into Jump and then the battle begins Waiting for your order We will now engage the Arcadia . Prepare for battle ! Roger Fleet Gejian has verified their coordinate links Large number of asteriods spotted outside the area . Begin Jump My friends , This is the final voyage of your journey Confused ? I don 't understand . Red Alert ! Enemy fleet approaching ! Most of the enemy ships are in front with a distance of about 36,000km The asteroid debris should have been a good line of defense How did they come from the rear ? They traveled here at sub-light speed . A nasty trick . Do we engage them ? Affirmative . Let 's give them a warm welcome . Understand . Dark Matter increasing to maximum output Broad cannons ready . Deploying turrets in active mode It 's really quite a grand welcome . Arcadia 's position still registering as ahead They 're heading towards the asteriod debris . We 're ready to force a breakthrough They 've activated the Dark Matter Shield Guns are now in range of the Arcadia We 're awaiting your order Wait ... Just a little more ... Brother Now ! Fleet , fire at will ! The warships are shelling each other . We 're losing ships ! The target is nowhere to be found ! Hold your fire ! We have an emergency situation A hologram ? A clever plan ... Arcadia spotted heading for Saturn Commander 2nd Fleet , use Jump to get there Ships within a radius of 7400km , a total of 136 enemy units Very close Were not safe yet The enemy did a stupid thing . Yama Incoming transmission from Arcadia . Using Gaia Fleet 's access code . Connected . Brother You 're still alive Please back off your Fleet . Harlock 's mission is not to destroy the Universe . His plans go far beyond what you think . Just listen to me . Is that all you can say ? I 'm very disappointed . Disconnect . Brother Transport the " Kaleido Star System " . The collapsed neutron star , Is converted into a powerful light source . As long as it maintains its massive photon energy output then , the Arcadia won 't have a chance . 2nd Fleet 84-93 Flank the Arcadia on both sides Use light to dispel darkness . This will be a huge battle all over again A powerful gravitational field has appeared outside the Fleet What ? It 's huge I can 't give you an estimate Critical light Irradiate ! Debris increasing ... Raising shields to maximum output Photon light gradually in cool down . Alert ! Incoming debris impact ! Intense electromagnetic interference , cannot activate remote sensors Approximately 2 minutes to reboot . Report target 's status . Using full telephoto global scan and spectroscopic scan Arcadia is nowhere to be found ! Disappeared ? No trace found . Was it still a holographic projection ? How ? They were very close to the target zone . Arcadia detected above ! What ? The battleships are too slow to turn around in time . Heavy cruiser " Nei Lede " completely destroyed " Ares " also suffered heavy damage Close the gap between the warships . Immediate action Gravitational perturbations from the Arcadia have changed It 's heading here ... The Arcadia is here Yama 97 % of the Fleet warships have suffered major damage Including the " Oceanus " , only 17 ships are functioning Try to hold on Brother , it 's useless to resist Gaia Fleet 's flagship looks very ' inspiring You need to abandon it The " Oceanus " will be used to hold captives Inform the Gaia Coalition that we have hostages Good job . Thanks to you , brother You lured Joint Fleet Operations according to what I 've told you I 'm only doing this for her It 's Nami Keep her out of this I want to take a gamble . Humans can start over again Thus , we have to ... Start over ? You don 't understand anything We 're about to enter the Earth 's field of protection After a hundred years , We return to our home planet As a Junction Point in the Earth , Here we can start over . How do we install the Dimensional Oscillation Warhead on the Earth ? Earth is not meant to be blown . The Captain will decide what to do . Just trust in him . Harlock is deceiving you guys . When we enter the field of the inviolability You 'll see what I mean . What 's that ? A hologram . It 's a holographic projection ... That means ... This ... Harlock committed a great sin The blue surface is actually a holographic projection satellite illusion ? Captain A hundred years ago , Humans were scattered throughout the universe and the Earth was the centre of a return to war " The Homecoming War " Tired of tragic human conflicts The Gaia Coalition wanted to end the war The Earth is our " holy land " Regardless of what people do , this planet cannot be violated Then , the Earth was guarded by the Gaia Fleet Solar Federation Officer Captain Harlock was on board the battlecruiser " Death Shadow " Harlock ? The Death Shadow was equipped with the Dark Matter Energy fuelling their warships It was simply an armada Planning to resurrect the lost alien civilizations Harlock met Toshiro , a former Solar Federation Officer They became good friends . We told him the impending doom of our race , he wanted to save it . We agreed to preserve our heritage Harlock continued to defend the Earth But the Gaia Coalition is giving special treatment to immigrant politicians . That was the exchange for peace Beautiful words can not end the war But , This man launched a revolt and the Earth is the only shrine It convinced Harlock to start fighting He hated Gaia Coalition 's betrayal Toshiro ! So the Gaia Coalition turned against him . Toshiro Harlock was cornered . He threatened to use the Dark Matter Energy If Dark Matter Energy covered the Earth , then ... the Earth would truly be inviolable That 's how dangerous this thing is It had to be prevented ... But it didn 't happen as Harlock expected . Dark Matter Energy converted the earth itself The Earth was mercilessly devoured And everything ended . Everyone is gone , But ... The man rose up Not the same Harlock that we knew . The ship had changed , transformed into a cursed pirate warship By the end of the 5th year of war The Gaia Coalition was pursuing him and then Harlock disappeared That purpose ... With the extinction of the Nibelung race throughout the worlds ... the Gaia Coalition would have come to an end . That man ... Could not bear the burden and wanted to end all evil Yama What would you do ? What will become of the universe ? This infinitely large bubble called the universe ... A space node will act like a cork If you pull the plug , Everything will return to nothing , Then be reborn again So this is it ! No other way Humans , After all , the history of the universe appears only in a quick moment . Whether or not , in the sense that it exists , There still exists hope , Which can 't simply be annihilated I fear for the time people will again target the Earth The home planet that gave birth to all . Back to that era of ignorance which contains infinite possibilities ... But that Earth is useless now . Doing it all over . Earth is all we had . But it gave me a cursed ship It awarded me for immortality . But that doesn 't compsenate for those I lost It 's not your fault ! If only , We could bring back the dead Then all will be well in the world . Kei The restoration of Humanity ... How ? Harlock Don 't carry the burden by yourself We are here to help you . Miime What is this ? We 're moving away from the Earth Who 's doing this ? My friends ... You 're betraying me now ? The " Oceanus ' " engines are under way They are in the engine room ! All the prisoners have escaped ! How ? Fast Report Emergency compartment closed ! The captives are armed with weapons ! Don 't let them enter the bridge ! You ! Kei said it before Mediocrity is better to die ... Everyone is the same Maybe someone looking forward to the end all of this But , So , is this your answer ? Probably ... You are immortal Not all things can be killed This cursed body is all that remains Space Criminal Code S-OO999 Harlock Has violated the Article 62 , terrorizing and bringing terror in the universe , You 're under arrest . Breaking news has been received , Gaia Coalition has an announcement . The 100-year-old fugitive who hindered the peace agreement , Space Pirate Captain Harlock and his crew of 40 people , have been arrested by the Gaia Fleet . You are now in charge of the Central Command . Brother Where 's Nami ? Stay away from her . Why is he still looking for you ? Forget it . I already knew . Your heart belongs only to Yama You know nothing . The way you respond to me ... You want to eliminate hatred ? Don 't say something nice ! Look at this In my own way , I 've done this just for you I regretted that day , Why him ? Now you 're aware of this Your pain is not Yama 's fault I ... always loved Yama , your brother This can 't be I wanted to eliminate your hatred That 's enough ! Don 't say it ! This needs to end ! Stop it ! I lied to you I 'm sorry , Ezra Nami ... You 're my favorite I know that . It is most likely you Fool ... Fool ! Fool ! Fool ! FOOL ! It 's Nami 's Use this to communicate with her A virus invaded her network It seems Her life support system malfunctioned It 's a pity This can 't be ... Ezra what did you do ! Look , Yama This is the only planet where flowers grow Your mother 's flower . Turned out strong. it blooms beautifully I 've tried to persuade Ezra , To let me handle the greenhouse cultivation . I hope you will look after these flowers too . Even if you don 't like it . No matter how hard , Embrace your own pain . If possible , break through it And also , Ezra has been always at my side His gentleness made ​ ​ me feel at ease . I chose Ezra . So don 't blame yourself . Some day , if you meet that important person , remember me . We are family . You look very weak . As expected . This afternoon , You will be executed . Your source of immortality , The Dark Matter Energy has failed you this time . The curse you have been given will be removed . It 's futile . What 's your goal ? Could it be you want to re-do it again ? Everybody knows that 's not possible . I have to rely on others In that case ... No matter who it is ... Good luck with that ... Freedom Today , Soon , the universe 's Space Pirate Captain Harlock and his crew , will accept the merciful gift of the death rituals of Gaia The communications network between galaxies , live from the Gaia Coalition , will broadcast the event . By now most of the Elders have taken their offical positions High Supreme Court of Gaia Order and peace Order and peace Our Home planet Mother Earth Gaia who scattered her children throughout this universe shines forever Her children sleep Until that day Even if ... It 's as fantastic as ... Their nonsense speeches are just a waste We 're just puppets to him You guys already know it What did you say ? ! I have a plan . What is it ? Obviously we have no place on this planet , only on the pirate ship . There 's this problem , What is it ? The Captain doesn 't care if we live or die . You 're just like Yama You 're worse ! You 're not qualified to complain ! Like you , I 'm also desperate to explain the Captain 's objectives Execution will commence Guard ship to main exit Repeat Guard ship to main exit Hey , we 've been ordered to fall back What 's with that guy ? Commence field collapse Commence Singularity , maintain barriers Osmotic field on , quantum gravity diverse state maintained Spatial collapse rate rising to predetermined level Spatial collapse rate has risen to critical point Reduce pressure Breakthrough properties will begin shortly Execution will start in 10 seconds Pressure units have exploded ! All readings are off scale ! Dark Matter Energy released ! Get out ! What are you doing ? I was wrong Right now ? ! Not only the Gaia Coalition is wrong Harlock , everyone is wrong Go down to Earth , you 'll understand what I mean . There 's something I need you to see . Why do we believe in this guy ? I 'll tell you after this . The guards will soon come Let the ship escape Hey , do you believe in him ? Stay here and you 'll die Come I hate this Switch to the screen inside the ship Yes ! How is this possible ? Rebellion ... It was a hindered execution Quickly terminate the broadcast ! Dispose them at once ! I understand . Space squadron ! Obliterate all " Arcadia " crew members ! I 'm not going to run anymore ! We need your help to escape the ship Captain , fight it ! You said this ship is unable to move Hurry ! Stand up Captain ! You may indeed have destroyed mankind 's Home planet , But you gave us shelter That 's the ship There is no other place for us . Harlock . Please take a look . This flower is Earth 's hope Hey , how the ... There are signs Earth is regenerating Nothing has ended , this is the beginning . Even if we destroy the flower ... Fertilitize the world No matter how many times you try to revive it , Even humans can have hope Repeat the event ... Forever This is ... Freedom My crew ... The Dark Matter Energy is continuing to increase We 're unable to absorb it Where did the ship go ? In the direction it 's taken it 's heading for Earth ? Mobilize all forces in the solar system Prevent the " Arcadia " from going near the Earth ! What 's the status of the " Oceanus " ? Repairs are not yet completed , But it can get under way Yes , sir ! Amazing , this ship moves by itself ... The coordinates of the Earth ? Could it be the " End Point " ? Yattaran The Gaia Coalition is communicating over the galaxy networks Hyperspace communications should be able to communicate , simultaneously throughout the universe From now on the ship will be fighting against the strength of the Earth 's satellite hologram n order to reveal the truth to the whole universe . Yama Convey to the people , The true face of the Earth I never expected this ... Prepare the ship for combat ! I 've lost count again Our goal is the hologram satellite Ignore them . Yattaran , it 's not good ! It 's not that simple They 're removing the hologram satellite Don 't let them succeed ! Their central hull armour is critical ! Yattaran ! Alright then , Come come come come come ! Linking to Gaia Coalition galactic communications network Success ! Yama ... We can 't avoid it ! This is the " Arcadia " To all the people from around the universe ... Don 't look away See it with your eyes The Gaia Coalition wants to hide the truth The true face of the Earth Because of past wars ... The beautiful planet was turned into this Stop the broadcast ! But ... do not despair . Earth is still alive The land of the dead has regained new life This kind of life is extremely fragile But we must nurture it In repeating the cycle , Don 't just rely on dreams . Don 't be afraid to accept the truth . We can take our first real step . We are not alone . Even if our race is dead Life will continue to grow . Look in front of you . Our last hope All the life In this thing is there forever ! That 's really stupid ! In this situation the order of the universe will collapse Stop that " Arcadia " as soon as possible ! Do not panic . The use of the " Jovian Blaster " is permitted . " Jovian Blaster " ? For the sake of the " The Homecoming War " , complete your mission using this ultimate weapon But ... The " Arcadia " is in the Earth 's orbit Earth will ... That sacred place is No longer inhabitable . We need to consider making it a sacrfice . Please wait ! Your Lordship ! Order the Fleet to fall back , Ezra . Hostile ships retreating ... I don 't get it . That Gaia Fleet guy Wants to give up ? One ship approaching ... The " Oceanus " ! Ezra The ship is prepared to withstand any shock ! Why is this happening ? The enemy has grappled the ship ! Is it charged yet ? They 'll pay for this ! Kei , are you alright ? This is not your style at the moment ... Yattaran ! I 'm not running away anymore ! Ezra , where are you ? Get out of my way ! Rail loop electromagnetic poles on boot " Jovian Blaster 's " rotation speed increasing Situation report update Centrifugal-free transition to the excited state of atmospheric plasma " Jovian Blaster " charged at 60 % Rotation rate still rising Jupiter will gradually deform ... 180 seconds before critical output achieved " Oceanus " and " Arcadia " must keep each other busy Proceeding ... Never mind I wish we had more to spare " Do not despair " ? You 're now a saviour , Yama ? Where are you Ezra ? You couldn 't even save the woman you love . You ? Save mankind ? What a joke . I 've got you now . You are so naive With your mother 's flower , In this situation you haven 't any hope ! But the flower ... bloomed ! You 're too late ! If not for you , Nami would not be dead ! That test beam , was shot from Jupiter " Arcadia " , along with the Earth will be destroyed You ... Captain , please go Miime has been able to protect the Earth . She 's doing this for a long time . We can 't completely control it . The results from the test firing look excellent . To end " The Homecoming War " this is our only way . Resetting almost complete ! The second plasma energy level now at 95 % approaching target value Preparing to open the force field ! Hyperspace tracking locking on to the target Targeting " Arcadia " Automatic tracking complete This one is the last , There are enough worlds for us After all , our life is not yet ended . Harlock This is ... Sorry Miime For you ... It 's alright . I feel your sufferings . Just continue doing what you believe in . Even if there 's a price to pay . This is the only way to save mankind . This can 't be . What happened ? They changed the course of the beam Preventing it from hitting the Earth . " Oceanus " Ezra Deflecting the beam from hitting the Earth Instead it hit the " Arcadia " Why ? I wanted to see Nami 's flowers They 're really beautiful Brother While the Earth is recovering , the Government will once again take all the glory . " The Homecoming War " will happen again . Using this will prevent that from happening . Dark Matter Energy will be released . Many will die . You know it . This world is Nami and Ezra 's inheritance Is that so ? If the Union makes mistakes again , I will not hesitate to bring them ... Curse and terror Repeating the cycle again . As long as humans unite There will be hope and freedom This should continue to exist , Forever ... This is the Planetary Joint Army Place yourself by the bridge You are advised to surrender All survivors leave the ship Quickly disarm yourselves . If you refuse to surrender , We will resume our attack Harlock was right in believing in you . The " Arcadia " will rise again ... The " Arcadia " ! Full sail ! Human 's recession There is nowhere to go forward All is changed The man will continue his legacy In order to bring hope and freedom Recall that day Just the thought of another day Why are we on this end How did we end up this way What we 've done What did we do wrong ? God ah God Despite the rush hour flow to Even though the days go on That day has long gone So far so far away from I still feel fresh in our memory It seems so close Always makes me like shoulder the burden Always weighing on my shoulder Extraordinary moment A time like no other That day changed everything It all changed on that day Grief and endless pain Sadness and so much pain You can feel my sorrow You can touch the sorrow here I do not know what to blame I don 't know what to blame Just watched repeatedly in the side I just watch and watch again Even if the flow of time to rush Even though the days go on That day has long gone So far so far away from I still feel fresh in our memory It seems so close Even if the flow of time to rush Even though the days go on That day has long gone So far so far away from I still feel fresh in our memory It seems so close It is what is left What did it leave behind ? And from here we take and erase what What did it take from us and wash away ? Maybe a long way It may be long But as long as we re ' heart ' start But with our hearts start a new Keep the faith and never give up And keep it up and not give up And head forward With our heads held high You have entered hell and come back again You have seen hell and made it back again How to forget ? We can not forget How to forget ? We can 't forget Along those lost souls The lives that were lost along the way Later , you will realize that no matter where And then you realize that wherever you go Both to the security of There you are Waits for no man Time won 't stop So we never stop So we keep moving on Last night turned into light Yesterday 's night turns to light Nights return to light Tomorrow 's night returns to light To become the light Be the light Always makes me like shoulder the burden Always weighing on my shoulder Extraordinary moment A time like no other That day changed everything It all changed on that day Grief and endless pain Sadness and so much pain Anyone can close your eyes Anyone can close their eyes Pretend everything goes smoothly Pretend that nothing is wrong Open your eyes Open your eyes To find the light And look for light That day what is left What did it leave behind ? And from here we take and erase what What did it take from us and wash away ?

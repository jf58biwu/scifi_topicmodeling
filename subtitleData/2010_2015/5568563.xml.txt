 Who the hell is Jin Cong ? Chinese intelligence . Doctor , you know what you must do now . Refuse , and I will dig the chip out of his dead skull myself . Drop your weapon . Don 't do it , Gabriel . Now , doc ! Want to explain to me why we 're giving Jin Cong back to the Chinese ? We 're making a trade . But please , don 't treat me this way . Nobody else around here is gonna rub that sweet , sweet oil all over your smelly platens - - nobody . You two have a fight ? We 're supposed to make hard copies of our TR-9 reports every week . It 's the only time we ever use paper in this place . But something is not working . And , yes , it 's plugged in . Hey . How about some help , huh ? Can you do some of that voodoo that you do on her - - you know , a little chip-to-chip action ? You really want me to use a $ 30 billion piece of technology to troubleshoot your printer ? If the chip were on the other foot , she 'd help you . Don 't listen to him . " She . " Them again ? Really ? Gabriel , it 's a D.O.D. security audit . What did you expect ? This is our gesture-based satellite control console . With a wave of the hand , you can manipulate outer space . You 're moving one of our satellites across the world ? I 'm issuing the command right now . It 'll take a couple of hours till it 's actually complete . The CIA has asked us to monitor north Korea 's deployment of their Sang-O class submarines . They 've been straying outside the 50-kilometer exclusion zone . So , if it 's gesture-based , how do you prevent unauthorized access to the system ? All of Cybercom 's systems use the same live-tissue palm scan to verify users . So the computer registers skin conductivity and subdermal capillary structure to calculate a 2,048-bit verification . That means all the people accessing this system have the appropriate clearances to do it . And what if a user loses their I.D. ? Susan , the question you should be asking - - " What happens if the user gets their hand cut off in a freak gardening accident ? " Well ? Agent Jameson . Yes , ma 'am ? Let 's do a hand count today . Make sure everyone has two . Hand count . Two per . Yes , ma 'am . I feel safer already . Are you seeing this ? At first , I thought there was a bug in the print driver , right ? But then I realized it started filling the ring barrier with all kinds of nonsense . It looks like the registry 's corrupted . Oh , gee , I hadn 't noticed . Is there a problem , gentlemen ? No . There 's no problem . Okay , yes , maybe just a smidge . Agent Neal . Let me guess - - you want to see my hands . I realize everyone hates us before we even get here , but there is a method to the madness . Hey , I get it . You 're Big Brother 's freelance snitch . Kind of comes with the territory . Ouch ! " Snitch . " Really ? What I meant was you don 't need to apologize . I 'm responsible for security myself . Oh , then you can appreciate the importance of considering every possible threat scenario . Of course , just as long as caution doesn 't paralyze you from taking action . I agree , which is why I 'm gonna go out on a limb here and ask you to let me buy you dinner tonight . Um ... I 'm sorry , David . I can 't . Why not ? I 'm friendly , age-appropriate , employed . I just think it would be inappropriate . Only if you 're lucky . Thanks , anyway . He ask you out ? What ? You said no ? Probably for the best . He 's not the one . And how do you know ? Oh , does your chip make you a fortune teller now ? I don 't need a chip for that . He 's a nice guy , you like him , but your inner voice says no . And how do I know when my inner voice says yes ? You just know . Wouldn 't kill you to have a cup of coffee with the guy , though . We do need a passing grade . Guys , I think I need your help . Bro , I don 't know how this happened . I 'm very careful about what I put in my baby ! The entire station is down . Scanning that now . It 's not just you . It 's the whole network . Lillian ? Yeah , you might want to come down here . Nelson found some kind of irregularity with the network . Wait , let me see if this will help . No , that 's not gonna work . Whatever it is , it 's aggressive . How did this thing sneak up on me ? Damn it , where is this thing coming from ? ! I swear that wasn 't me . Crossover power is engaged . Systems coming back online . Nelson , what 's going on ? Honestly , I don 't know . Gabriel , report . Gabriel , are you okay ? Who the hell are you people ? One of our nation 's most decorated soldiers . He 's a hero , and now our country 's most secret weapon . Gabriel possesses a rare genetic mutation that allowed us to implant a microchip in his brain . We connected his mind directly to the information grid . It 's something the chip does that nobody expected . I can create a virtual snapshot of an event in my mind and then walk through it . It 's like a virtual evidence wall . At U.S. Cyber Command , we created a highly specialized unit around him ... Satellite in five . ... and assigned an agent to protect him . Run ! He 's the first of his kind - - the next evolution of intelligence . Gabriel ? Gabriel , can you hear me ? Comms is reporting an electromagnetic pulse briefly knocked out our communications grid . An E.M.P from where ? Systems are recovering . Oh , crap . I got a level-three violation on the incoming N.I.C. Lock it down . Gabriel , do you know where you are ? Something is very wrong with him . Jameson . Yeah . Take Gabriel down to Dr. Cassidy . I want a full report as soon as you have it . Okay . Come on . Let 's go , big guy . Whoa , whoa . Easy , pal . We 're on the same team , here , all right ? " Same team " ? What are you talking about , same team ? Somebody needs to tell me what the hell is going on here ! Gabriel , relax . I 'm gonna take you down to clockwork right now , okay ? " Clockwork " ? What the hell is clockwork ? Get him down to the lab . Whoa , whoa . Hey , hey , hey . Be careful with him ! All right , everyone , this is a phase-four security lockdown . Disable remote access . Take the backup servers offline . Jameson , transfer satellite control to n2c2 at Cheyenne Mountain . Cheyenne Mountain is not responding - to our transfer request . - What ? They 're not responding because they 're not receiving us . Wait , whosever behind the attack is spoofing our station I.D. And has taken control of our outbound communications . How we doing on that security audit ? Let me out of here . Gabriel , you need to calm down . We 're not trying to hurt you . " We " ? Who 's we ? Your name is Gabriel Vaughn . You were a delta force soldier . Now you work for a top-secret program called clockwork . My name is Riley Neal . I 'm your partner . " Partner " ? I .. kind of look after you ... over you . We have this ... I can 't explain it . We 're friends ... And partners . Uh , you know what I mean . Are we ... intimate ? No ! No . God , no . I just - - I mean , no , uh , it 's not like that . Why am I locked up ? You 're not locked up . You 're in there for your own protection . Protection from who ? You ? From yourself . Well , I don 't plan on hurting myself , Ms. Neal , so how about you let me out ? " Ms. Neal . " That 's great . You need to do something . I 'm trying to do something , Riley . The brain works much like a computer , okay , even without the chip . There 's short-term memory - - ram , if you will - - and there is long-term memory , a hard drive known as the hippocampus . For the chip to process data organically , it had to be connected to the hippocampus . The E.M.P. disrupted Gabriel 's nerve endings . The result was like , uh ... Huh ? ... unplugging the hard drive from the computer . E.M.P. ? Yeah , it 's a discharge of electromagnetic energy that can temporarily disable electrical circuits . Gabriel 's chip seems to have made him susceptible to just such an attack . So , the memories are in there . You just ... need to plug them in . Yeah , well , that 's where the mystery of the brain comes in . Given time , the right stimuli , sometimes it can find an alternate route , but sometimes it cannot . One thing I do know is this . The longer he is like this , the less chance we have of getting him back . Tier five bulkheads are down . No , make that tier six . What about the DMZ server ? It 's going offline . Lillian , NORAD 's still not responding . No one 's responding . Okay , tier seven has been compromised now , too , which means if we - - I know what it means , Nelson . It means when they get to tier 10 , they will have access the most sensitive information this country has . Yes , but where is it coming from , Lillian ? Who has the kind of power to pull off an attack of this scale ? Russians , Chinese , who knows ? Maybe the Iranians have finally gotten their act together . And there go our security cams . See if you can isolate the gateway firewall . Out of my space , please . The gateway firewall - - it 's the security device that protects the wan interface . I know what it is , lady . They burned through that 5 minutes ago . Now back off ! Please ! They 're making a run for the prism silo . Lillian ... you were right . They 're not trying to just shut us down . They 're going after our classified data . Okay , that 's it . Orion ? No , absolutely not . That is an intolerable risk . Orion is a protocol of last resort . Take a look around . There are no resorts left . Tier eight bulkheads are gone . Oxygen scrubbers are powering off . Jameson . Orion . Cut the trunk . Can you stop the noise ? ! What noise ? " What noise " ? Can 't you hear it ? This is what he was like in the beginning . He 's flooded with data . He has no idea how to control it . How did you do it back then ? Well , we had him in a controlled , shielded environment . Right now , he 's wide open . Where am I ? What is this place ? You are at U.S. Cyber Command in angel 's bluff , Virginia . Virginia ? Is that where I live ? It 's where you work . You have a microchip in your brain ... and it 's malfunctioning . A what ? You 're not going in there ! I cannot talk to him like this . You have no idea what he 's capable of . No . You stay here . Why ? ! Because I do know what he 's capable of . Lock the door . I know you 're scared . But I just need you to calm down and just look at me . Okay ? I need you to trust me . Access my personnel file . How do I do that ? Gabriel , we used to listen to Mozart 's 5th symphony together , okay ? You - - you hated it , but in learning to identify a single violin , that taught you how to exclude all but one sensory input . Now , look at Riley and exclude everything but her , all right ? Just focus . I have something . " Arrested for public nudity and possession of a controlled substance . " That ... never happened to me . Gabriel ... Very good . But it appears that you are in my personnel file . What 's going on ? What happened ? What the hell ? I lost access . Everything went dark . Finally , silence . I don 't understand . You went dark , and he went dark at the same time ? Someone cut the trunk . What does that mean ? They 've cut the incoming optic lines . No more access to the outside . What about cellular and satellite ? Gabriel should have access to - - No , no , not in this building . It 's shielded to protect it from prying eyes and ears . When Gabriel is in this building , he 's accessing the world outside through our internal network . With the hard lines down , no access . It 's back on . No . Oh , damn it . There it is again . Thought you said it wasn 't online . It 's not , not to the outside , anyway . But I still have access to the internal servers , and ... Gabriel would have that , too . So , just no ... connection to the outside world . This must be the cavalry . System 's down . We 've lost all communication - - Look on the bright side - - at least our servers are safe . Yeah , but now we 're totally cut off ! We 're operating in the blind . Ms. strand , you have just removed from service one of the core pieces of the United States technology infrastructure . Put it in your report . What 's that sound ? Gunfire . We 're under attack ! Be advised - - Jin Cong . After all the trouble you caused me ... did you really think I wouldn 't be back for you ? You are wondering how this is possible . The Chinese government promised you they would lock me away forever . How , then , can I be here now ? One of the challenges for my people in learning American English is your extensive use of idioms . Personally , I 've always enjoyed them . One of my favorites is " a taste of your own medicine . " It 's gonna be a very difficult day for you . Thank you , Norman . If you 're here for Gabriel , Cong , you 've miscalculated . He isn 't in the building . Oh , I 'm afraid he is . In fact , I would think by now , you 've had him taken to Dr. Cassidy 's lab for a diagnostic after the E.M.P. But the truth is , Gabriel is not my problem now . He 's yours . Are you really this foolish ? There are special forces troops gearing up to storm this building . Oh , no one is gearing up to do anything . You severed the trunk , remember ? The Orion protocol ? The spoof station I.D. He must have figured out a way to trick the D.O.D. Into thinking we 're still all right . By our calculations , we have approximately 48 minutes before anyone realizes that something 's wrong . We 'll be out of here in 35 . I 've had ... a great deal of time to plan . Ah , my favorite of all your idioms ... " Idle hands are the devil 's workshop . " They 've breached C-doc , but there 's no reports of casualties . Well , how could there be ? We have no communication system . We 're lucky we have power . Yeah , we need eyes . Can you tap into the security cameras ? Dr. Cassidy , can you do that ? Yes . Yes , of course . I 'll try . As long as we have power , I should be able to find a way in . Ohh , damn it ! Gabriel ! Gabriel ! Well , that 's handy . Wow . This guy 's efficient . It took him all of 6 minutes to grab the schematics of the chip and everything we have on the clockwork program . But what else does he want ? Yeah . I don 't get it . Why not just take Gabriel and go ? I don 't know . He 's still looking for something on the network . Well , whatever it is , he 's gonna find it . This Norman is varsity . They 're not going to find it . What are you talking about ? He 's already halfway through the network in 35 minutes . This g- - You know what he 's looking for , don 't you ? I have an idea . Well , what is it ? Okay , where is it ? It 's not on the network . Okay , look , Lillian , whatever it is , you know we 'll die saving it . They 're looking for something called the Athens list . Athens , as in Athens-4U7R ? It 's the gene mutation that 's required for the chip to work in a human being . Right . What 's on the list ? Children . Children with the gene mutation . Lillian , do you realize how spectacularly dangerous a list like that could be ? Yes , Jameson . It 's something people take hostages over . Does my dad know about this ? What do you think ? He 's the one who discovered the mutation in the first place . Damn it , Gabriel . Where the hell are you going ? It 's not here . Ms. strand , this is very simple . You are aware of what I 'm looking for , yes ? How would I know what you 're looking for ? The so-called Athens list . I don 't know what that is . - No ! - Don 't ! That one is next . Ah , eureka ! Victory is mine . Okay , look , Cong , you want to shoot someone , shoot me . No . It 's fine . It 's fine ! Lillian ... don 't you give this guy a thing . Where is it ? Ohh . You like idioms ? Well , how about ... Oh , my God . I got nothing . Sir , uh , you might want to see this . Really ? Nothing ? You get a chance like that , you got nothing ? You 're sending those two for Gabriel ? Good luck . You never can make things easy , can you ? You don 't even know who you are , and you 're still a pain in my ass . Gabriel . Whoa . Relax . Gabriel ... How was I able to do that ? Was that the microchip ? No , that 's all you . You were delta force . You can be very lethal . Just put the gun down . We 're friends , Gabriel . You 're not a killer . Good . That 's good . We need to get you back to clockwork - - Get behind me . Gabriel , thank God you 're okay . Now , I understand if you don 't remember . You told me this might happen . Just look at her , all right , and pull up her files . Double agent - - endangered a vice president and revealed state secrets to the Pakistanis . That is not true . Gabriel , he 's corrupted my file . She 's the enemy , Gabriel . She 's our enemy . He 's lying to you , Gabriel . We need to tie her up . We got to move . Gabriel . Gabriel , that is Jin Cong . And we searched the servers . The Athens list isn 't on the main computer network . Can you find out where they hid it ? You mean with this chip thing ? See what I can do . Listen to me , Gabriel . I 'm ordering you to stand down . I don 't take orders from you . Actually , you do . You 're just experiencing a malfunction with your chip . Right , the same chip you want to implant in the brains of children ? The list isn 't here . It 's not being stored on these servers . Where is it ? Where did you hide it ? You may think you know me , but there 's no way I 'll let you do to those kids what you did to me . We didn 't do anything to you . You begged me to give you the chip so that you could find your wife . Do you remember her ? Your wife , Amelia ? Or has he taken that away from you , too ? She 's playing games . Your wife was a double agent . And as for your marriage , it was never real ... merely a cover . Go ahead . Check for yourself . That is not true , Gabriel . You loved Amelia very much . And yet I 'm told that you killed Gabriel 's wife . Who the hell told you that ? It 's in your sit report . Or are you going to deny it , agent Neal ? You did . You killed her . You see ? You can 't trust them . But we don 't have time for this . We need to find the list of children . It 's on a machine not connected to the network . Gabriel . Do you know where that is ? We 'll need her to access it . Well , well . The proverbial getaway cars . Think about what you 're doing , Gabriel . What do you think Jin Cong is gonna do with that list once he has it ? You have no right to these children , just as you had no right to Gabriel . Don 't you see , Gabriel , that he 's using you ? You have to know the truth . I do know the truth . Lillian strand , director of United States Cyber Command . Implicated in the deaths of three soldiers as part of an experimental research project code-named clockwork . You 've been killing people and hiding behind your job . Those men were volunteers , Gabriel . You were all volunteers . What about the children ? Did they volunteer , too ? This one . You 're not gonna get away with this . Someone will stop you , and when they do , you 're gonna pray for those days when you were back in a hole in China , being used as a pincushion by the guards . Hey . Are you guys gonna kick some ass ? Shh . Don 't leave me out ! Shh . I can kick some serious ass ! Believe me ! Dad ? You ready ? Let 's do this . Nelson ! I 've got to get to the dry server room . Go . I 'll take care of things here . Hey , Nelson . Are you okay ? I just killed somebody . No , you didn 't . All you did was kill the ceiling . I don 't have to pay for that , do I ? I could just as easily cut it off . Now , was that so hard ? Almost have it . You can stop there I can use the security cameras to see , remember ? You 're fighting on the wrong side of this , Gabriel . I know the things you 've done , the people you 've killed . How you 've kept me under surveillance like I 'm some kind of prisoner , some kind of tool . Gabriel , don 't ! Don 't move ! Don 't move , Gabriel . I 'm not gonna let you get those kids . You 're gonna have to kill me . Riley . Riley , we can 't trust him . It 's okay . You were saying ? Cong is using the chip against you . He 's done something to the computers . You 're getting bad data . He 's lying to you , Gabriel . You stop thinking for a second , you 'll see that . " If I stop thinking . " Yes . You 're not a machine . You have to ignore the data . And do what ? Feel . You know me , Gabriel . Look at me , and ... tell me what you feel , not what you think . You may not have memory , but you have sense memory . What 's the difference ? It 's the recall of an emotion . I can 't remember any emotion . Nobody can remember emotions . You feel them , just like you felt that it was wrong to put a chip in those kids . You didn 't remember . You already knew . Not because of a chip , but because that ... is the kind of man you are . Listen to your ... inner voice . It 's talking to you right now . I know it is . And how do you know that ? I just know . Thank you . We have to stop Cong . Dad ? I have a gun . No , no , uh , you don 't need a gun , dad . It 's okay . Dad , it 's okay . Jameson ? Oh , my God . Oh . Oh , my God . Okay , okay . Oh . Okay . Oh , thank God you 're all right . Yeah . Is it true ? Is what true ? That you helped them to create a list of children ? That 's - - That list was supposed to have been destroyed . How could you ? ! Nelson , I discovered a mutation , a mutation that would allow us to augment the human mind . But I never - - God , ever - - intended to endanger anyone , especially children , please . Well , intended or not , dad , that list could only make those kids vulnerable . And now Jin Cong has it , and he 's gotten away . I wouldn 't be so certain about that if I were you . Um , sir , what 's that ? See , Jin Cong 's use of an E.M.P. to render Gabriel inoperable - - that got me thinking . It stands to reason that if an energy discharge can be used to temporarily dislocate an electronic circuit , then why can 't one be tuned that targets the dendrite-axon gap between human nerve endings ? You built a stun bomb ? I built a nonlethal , area-effect static discharge device that , uh , happens to employ frequencies relevant to the aforementioned - - You built a stun bomb . You bet your ass I did . Hey , guys . Oh , God . Don 't move ! That 's far enough . Gabriel ... Aah ! Riley please take Gabriel down to clockwork . I would like my agent back now . All righty . I 've , uh , replaced your data sources . I put in some new multi-path rejection algorithms . That 'll take care of any wide-band pulse problems . I would say , young man , that you are as good as new . Thanks , doc . And , uh sorry about all this . Hell , Gabriel . You proved something last night that philosophers have wondered across time immemorial . The mind is a collection of perceptions , calculations , memories , instinct . But , uh ... ultimately , the most important decisions - - they aren 't made by our minds . Are they ? No , sirree . Where we find our most profound intelligence is , after all ... in the heart . Hmm . Relax , Lillian . It 's me . You sure ? Well , welcome back , soldier . I 'd like a word with your doctor . You got it , boss . He 's gonna be fine . All right . You kept the Athens list , Lillian , even though we agreed that you would destroy it . It was something beyond my control . What were you thinking ? A list of children ! No respectable scientist , no respectable human being would ever keep a list like that . Well , we 're not dealing with respectable scientists . We 're dealing with the United States department of defense . They wanted their list of candidates . Please , the kids on that list are not candidates . They 're targets . Well , unlike you , I don 't have the luxury of ignoring orders . What I do is the best I can do . I keep the list as safe as I can , and I will continue to do so with your help . I want no part of this . The only way to protect that list is with Gabriel . And without you , there is no Gabriel . We owe it to those children . Like it or not , we 're the ones that put them in danger . And neither of us gets to walk away from that truth . " And now I am become death ... The destroyer of worlds . " Oppenheimer . Yeah . Well , at least now I understand what he felt when he split the atom . So much potential . So many reasons for hope . Oh , the irony . We are the hope . Sorry . I ... wasn 't exactly myself last night . Thanks for ... not shooting me . Too many witnesses . Yes ! Mwah ! Finally ! I 'm out !

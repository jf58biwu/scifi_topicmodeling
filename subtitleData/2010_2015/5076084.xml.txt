 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... I have cancer . You are the Count of St. Germain . An alchemist , used a stone to keep my body from aging . Myka ! Sutton ... My lying , cheating husband is once again out in the world . But I have plans , too . A 15-year-old-boy ? - Nick Powell . Why don 't you come back to South Dakota with us ? Is everything all right ? I 'm in , aren 't I ? Nick broke into the Warehouse and released one of the Bronze Sector prisoners ... - A guy named Paracelsus . - The alchemist . He destroyed the bronzer . And look ... This is Claudia . Four score and seven years ago ... I have a dream ... One giant leap for mankind ... Tear down this wall . It 's brilliant . I understand now . Thank you for freeing me , Nicholas . The centuries pass slowly when you 're encased in bronze . Mother and I tried many times to free you but ... No one knows better than I what an inconvenience the Warehouse can be . But no longer . We only ask one thing in return . I would have thought immortality was trade enough . Oh , we 've been ageless for far too long , uncle . Ah ! We want ... I ... I have to live out my life . Nothing can be done , until we are ... All right , I 'm sorry , but I can 't read lips . I can 't see . How could there be nothing in the system about why Paracelsus was bronzed ? I don 't know . I just figured he 's some kind of Lex Luthor-Joker - Doctor Doom-mash-up . I mean , the Warehouse only bronzed the baddest of the baddies . H.G. Wasn 't a baddie . Oh , yeah , now . But she did try and blow up the world which is the number-one criteria for an arch nemesis . Pete , look at this . Sutton 's ring and Genghis Khan 's mace and a bunch of other artifacts are missing . Yeah . I 'm just going to stick with super villain mash-up . Hey ! Don 't break her . Yeah , thank God you said that because , you know , breaking her , that was our big plan . You fixed it ? Just be glad that they didn 't destroy this whole thing . So , why do you think they took her out of there ? Were they gonna try and bronze someone else ? I don 't know . You know , who might know ? You . If you keep using the Durational Spectrometer . We also may be able to figure out where they went . Okay , yeah , we 're just ... Uh , okay . Whoa ! You don 't need lips to read that . Ready to go . Let 's give this a try . That didn 't work , Artie , she 's still bronze . Yeah , I know , I can see that . It just needs a reset . Yeah ... That 's probably just , you know , a loose wire , something electronic or ... It could be something far worse . Artie , what is it ? Yeah , it 's gone . What 's gone ? The artifact that makes this bronzer work . It 's a bronze Mesopotamian stele from 1250 BC . And , no , we do not have another one . So then , how do we un-bronze Claudia ? Artie ! What is that ? Judging from the smell , I 'd say it was a chemical reaction triggered by light . When I opened this panel . What the hell ? It 's a message from Paracelsus . Sutton 's involved . Why does it not surprise me ? So , Paracelsus has the bronzer stele and he 's holding it till he gets whatever it is that Sutton has . Yeah . That 's not a message . It 's a ransom note . You know , there 's really no reason to restrain me like this . I 'm not going anywhere . And this thing ... Chafes . The Folsom Prison ball and chain is attached to your shadow , not your person . It doesn 't chafe . But you 're absolutely right . You 're not going anywhere . No more games . Where 's Paracelsus and your son ? I don 't know . They weren 't supposed to leave . Yeah , well . He bronzed our friend . So forgive us for not believing you . But that was not part of the plan . Nicholas liked Claudia . You know what , lady , I 'm ... You know what ? What if Nick bronzed Claudia against his will ? Paracelsus did slap him pretty hard . Paracelsus struck my son ? In you urgency to free Paracelsus , you neglected to factor in one volatile element , Paracelsus ! That 's why Nick had the gun . I told him not to underestimate ... I should have un-bronzed Paracelsus ... Myself . Password ? Year I was born . 1502 . I would have guessed , 1508 . What 's your secret ? Oil of Olay ? No messages . Call him . Speed dial is " N. " Seriously . Pilates , sunscreen ... Straight to voicemail . Something 's happened then . Paracelsus made plans of his own . Now he 's got two hostages . Why don 't we start with this ? Why did you get involved with the most dangerous rogue alchemist in history ? Paracelsus was , is , Sutton 's brother . As you know , he had a rather heretical approach to , well , pretty much everything . Pushed the boundaries of science , and combining that science with artifacts . Multiple artifacts . Just a few moments . Step into the chamber . By your command , dear brother . The wine ? You 've drugged me . Why ? I was already playing your guinea pig for a reasonable fee . What the hell is my family doing here ? Have you lost your mind ? This was only supposed to be me . Let them go . You don 't need them . Oh , but you 're wrong my dear brother . I do . I must test my theory on a man , a woman and a child . How else would I determine whether gender or age alter the process or the result . I 'll see that your fee is tripled . And you woke up immortal . Paracelsus combined the Philosopher 's Stone with another artifact . With a copper bowl with the Egyptian symbol for life . That 's as dangerous as replacing gunpowder with nuclear fission . So , what happened next ? Not long after , Paracelsus disappeared . We later found out that agents from Warehouse 9 had taken him . And they bronzed him . Why ? No idea . I 've watched my son trapped in an endless adolescence of broken hearts . The first was the most painful . Her name was Sophia . They were just two 15-year-olds in love . What could be more natural ? Nick stayed 15 and ... Sophia grew up . She married , she had children and she forgot all about her first love . But Nick never forgot her . That was the first time that I saw the cruelty of immortality . Centuries caught between child and man . Never to fall in love , raise a family , share your life with someone . And worse , watching your loves age and die . He knows only loss . But the heart is strong and it takes a long time to give up hope . Nick fell in love again ... And again , until finally he understood that there would be no one to love for all eternity . That 's why you want mortality for your son . But the Philosopher 's Stone isn 't enough , is it ? You need Paracelsus to reverse it . And he 's got to use the same mixture of artifacts and elements he did the first time . You un-bronzed him . Even though you knew he was dangerous ? We assumed he would be weak after all that time , and grateful . I mean , some things are worth risking everything for . And my son is one of them . Artie , I 'm assuming that Paracelsus is going to try to use the Stone on himself . Where would Paracelsus find those specific elements ? We assumed in his laboratory in Constantinople . Istanbul , today . Call me crazy , but after 500 years I 'm going to bet that it 's been made into condos by now . Well , we have to try . Where exactly in Istanbul ? We were drugged when we were taken there . Deep underground somewhere . Well , we can 't just go diggin holes all over Istanbul Wait a minute . Paracelsus ' message said , " Sutton knows what I want . " If Sutton knows what Paracelsus wants ... Then Sutton would know where to find him . Any idea where you husband is ? Oh , I 've given up keeping track of Sutton after Napoleon put a price on his head . It 's just ... Too dangerous . Come on ! The old boy 's been there for , like , 11 hours . Well , you know , it takes time . Needle in a haystack . Maybe he needs some help . Really ? You 're gonna ... Put your hand in the lion 's cage ? No , no ! No ! No ! Good point . So , while we 're at it , why don 't we , uh ... Why don 't we talk about why you haven 't started your treatments yet ? What treatments ? Myka ... Your cancer treatments which you should have started , like , yesterday . Look . That 's why I didn 't tell anyone about this . Okay ? This is ... This is my disease . And it 's my treatment program and I will start it when I 'm good and ready to start it . You 're really telling me how to handle my own body ? No . It 's just you can 't just " handle " cancer . - Look , I got this under ... - I got it ! I got it ! I got it ! This system has been maddeningly slow . Okay . But ... Using Sutton 's last known whereabouts , which was Paris , I started with Interpol and then video from Charles de Gaulle Airport . And then , I widened the net . Artie ! Long story short . The Count is posing as a Russian businessman named Vladimir Kamenev . Natter Weekly ? Yes , Natter Weekly . It 's utterly reliable . How do you think we found Jimmy Hoffa ? - Really ? - Shh . Okay . The Count is in Luxembourg . And Natter says that he is " quite chummy " with an incredibly rich duchess . According to Natter , the Duchess is throwing an elaborate dinner party . So dust off your formal wear , and off to Luxembourg you go . Take Charlotte with you . Wait , Charlotte ? Yes , Charlotte . Charlotte knows her husband better than anyone . Just keep an eye on her . Go , go , go , go . Okay . Artie , get down to the Bronze Sector , now . I think she 's getting worse . Worse than bronzed ? Yeah . The Farnsworth , it 's crumbling . And that 's not normal , right ? No , the bronzer . It was built to stabilize the stele artifact and create a bronzed state for the prisoners who would remain alive , and ... That 's why we didn 't find her inside the bronzer . Paracelsus must have bronzed her outside the machine , using just ... The stele . What does that mean ? Her bronzed state is unstable . If we don 't find the artifact or find a way to reverse Claudia 's disintegration then eventually She 's just gonna ... Crumble away . Lots of bronze files . We got Bronze Age , Bronze Era , Bronze ... Couldn 't you ... Phosphor Bronze . Arsen ... Arsen ... What the hell ? Come on . Okay , Bronze Color , Bronze Properties , Bronze Cop ... I ... I got this . All right ? What , you 've got this ? Yes . There 's , like , a gazillion files that have something to do with bronze ... There are 6,083 files . Well , 6,083 files that you can 't get through alone . I don 't plan to get through them alone . What I plan to do is use an algorith ... Artie . Mrs. Frederic . You 're here . Yes , I am . Mrs. Frederic ? Yes , Arthur ? Why are you here ? There 's something here . There 's something of ... Yeah . I was hoping to correct that before . You know what ? I have something to show you . Tell me more about Paracelsus . That 's all we know . Warehouse 9 wouldn 't have bronzed him without reason . Well , whatever they had on Paracelsus , they didn 't keep any records of it . I must access the restricted files . The what ? There are restrict ... There are restricted files ? Of course , only the Regents in their infinite wisdom would have restricted files so we couldn 't access ... Arthur ! Not now . Yeah . Call me if there 's any change . Artie , Artie . What ? She didn 't just disappear , she walked away . Walked . Yeah . Okay , I got this . Act natural . - I am acting naturally . - Good , good . Where is the little weasel ? Oh , just follow the money . There . He looks a lot better than he did the last time we saw him . A lot more alive . Thank you all so much for joining us this evening . I am going to let you in on our little secret . This isn 't just a party . It 's an engagement party . Vladimir and I are going to be married . My future Duke . Not again , he 's been someone 's future duke , earl , count , marquis , 12 times in five centuries . Yeah , well , maybe he thinks eventually he can trade them all in for king . So why do this ? The lonely hearts con . Get engaged to a wealthy noblewoman . Stage a fancy party and then she gets out all the family jewels . " Family jewels . " So he can steal them ? Yes . And afterwards , he 'll use them to do a Thai gem scam or a rip deal . Oh , God ! He 's so predictable . You know what ? I 'll bet he 's that Nigerian prince that keeps emailing me . No , not you . No . Hey ! Not you . Sutton will be making off with the gems tonight . We can 't lose him . Okay . Pete ? You circle around ... Guys , guys , guys , guys ... I told you we should have worn moustaches . You 're saying the restricted files are kept in the storage room ? Is it a storage room ? Do you mind ? It 's nice to know that even grumpy , jaded Arthur Nielsen can still be surprised by endless wonder . I believe I said , " restricted . " Yeah , no . I 'm not offended . No . No . I 'm fine . Trey , you could go in , you 're a Methodist . There you are . Wait a minute . Yeah , this could be a possibility . Artie ! She 's getting worse . Again ? How much worse ? More crumbling and faster . Took an hour for the Farnsworth , now there 's cracks starting everywhere . Not her yet , but it 's just a matter of time . 64A . 64A ? Yeah , that 's four down . Two from the left . Hook her onto that , it 'll monitor her vitals . Meanwhile , I 'll keep looking into this . Well , look into what ? What is it ? You want a seminar or do you want to save her ? Go ! Forgive me , darling . But I haven 't had you to myself for hours . Perhaps your entourage would be so kind as to give us some privacy . We 'll be fine . Wait for me downstairs ... The formal announcement has left me rather unexpectedly amorous . Vladimir , you rogue . That I am . To us , my darling . To us . To us . Hmm . Whoo ! Ooh ! The bubbles went straight to my head . You must lie down . I 'll join you . Perhaps , we could think of something to do while you 're down there . Let me help you get more comfortable . Hold it right there , Count Sticky Fingers . Who are you ? We 're with the Secret Service . We 're here to extradite your fiance to the US . He 's been a very bad boy . Some folks back home want a piece of him . No , you can 't . Can 't . Can 't ! I believe I have a say in this . Her timing 's not bad . And who are you ? I 'm his wife . And I say , to hell with extradition . The files from Paracelsus were redacted by the Regents of Warehouse 9 . It 's most unusual . I feel left out . Tell me about it . I beg your pardon ? Um ... Nothing . It 's not important . I 'll have to contact Mr. Kosan . Good . Yeah . Bit of a ticking clock , you know ? If Sutton is a dead end , those files , they could be a clue to finding Paracelsus . Mrs. Frederic ! Yes , the files were redacted . I 'll have to contact Mr. Kosan . He 's dead ! My fiance is dead ! Sorry , love . Long story . Oh ! Pete ! Myka ! He 's gone . Oh , man ! How many times are we going to let him die and sneak off like that ? Okay , Charlotte , you just stay here . And don 't shoot anyone else . I 'm just gonna monitor your vitals . You know , it 's uh ... It 's kind of weird me doing all the talking . And , no . I don 't like it , I ... I miss your constant chatter . Don 't worry . Claud , we 're going to get you out of this . After all the times that you 've saved us . Oh , my God . Pete ! Argh ! I cast you out ! Hey . Oh , my God . After all the times you 've saved us , you 'd never let us hear the end of it if we didn 't save you , right ? And according to this , your vitals are ... Not responding . Artie , for crying out loud ! How did you hear me ? What ? No , look . I think I can boost her genetic material on a cellular level . And that will help her fight deterioration . But I 'm going to need DNA . Well , her toothbrush . Or a hairbrush . No , I need a blood sample . From a family member . You 've reached the voice mail of Josh . - Leave me a message . - Yeah . Joshua , this is Artie , again . Listen , I have left you messages on every number that you have . Will you call me back please ? This is urgent . Artie , her shoes and jacket are starting to crack . And I can 't get her vitals . Don 't worry . I will find Joshua . Hey , you 've reached the voice mail of Josh ... Oh , Joshua , call me back . Joshua , call me back . Please , don 't make me do this . Hey ! Look out ! Hey ! Hey ! Make a hole ! Make a hole ! Stop him ! Oi ! Oi ! You there . Those two ! They 're intruders . They just attacked the Duchess . Got him ! I , uh , guess we crashed the party , huh ? Did you see Mrs. Frederic ? Yes , I just left her at the BB . Yeah . Well she was a little unfocused this morning , but she 's gotten worse . And if I didn 't know any better I 'd say she was developing some kind of dementia , and rapidly . I don 't think she can help us anymore . The only thing we can do for Claudia now is to find out what is in those Paracelsus files . Come with me . No , no , no , no . Didn 't Mrs. Frederic tell you ? The files have been redacted . They 're not there . There 's something more urgent . Something we need to check . This is the Eldunari , the Warehouse 's central nervous system . This is what makes the mind of the Caretaker link with the soul of the Warehouse . The Eldunari . The symbols are moving in harmony . That 's a relief . Are they supposed to be doing that ? No , they 're not . The slow computer , Mrs. Frederic 's condition ... Something 's tearing apart the Warehouse from within its heart . Yes , I 'm afraid so . Mrs. Frederic 's mind is a mirror of the Eldunari . It seems that both of them are deteriorating . What is it with you two ? In five minutes I 'd have had the jewels . You 're a common thief . I am not common . All right , look . We don 't want to see you either . We need your help . You crashed my engagement party and shot me because you need my help ? Watch you tone , darling . Or next time I 'll shoot you in the face . Your brother bronzed our friend and he won 't release her till he gets what he wants . Paracelsus ? Impossible . He 's basted in bronze himself . It 's ironic since he 's the one who perfected the bronzing process . That 's how he knew what made the bronzer work . Yeah . Well , somebody let him out . He took the bronzing artifact with him . How could you be so stupid ? Well , you did this to us . And as I 've told you for half a millennium , it was only supposed to be me . I didn 't even believe he could do it . Sutton , Paracelsus took Nicholas . He says you know what he wants . Revenge springs to mind . Among other things . My brother was consumed with the idea of being immortal . And what immortals could accomplish . I was foolish enough to think him eccentric rather than insane . What did you do to us ? I gave you a gift . A gift that not even God can give . Immortality . You shall live forever . You in turn showed me that the Philosopher 's Stone works . Are you mad ? Waving some rock around didn 't make us immortal . But it did . Good God ! I must have killed the three of you a dozen times when you slept . I didn 't think it possible . Anything is possible , at a cost . It took an entire village to turn the three of you into gods . You killed them ? Well , all great achievement comes at a price . Socrates was executed . Magellan died proving the world was round . They gave their own lives , not the lives of others . The more fool them . Now get out . He was brilliant . But lived in his own moral universe . To kill an entire village ... I didn 't know what his endgame was but I wouldn 't allow him to cause more death . I went to the authorities . But it was the agents of Warehouse 9 who collected him . What is this ? How dare you ? What are you doing in here ? After he was bronzed the Regents wanted the Philosopher 's Stone . But I told them it had been destroyed . I wouldn 't destroy it in case we needed it again . So I split it and hid the two halves . You took a crystal from inside the geode . Your ring ! That 's how you restored plants as the Count of St. Germain . A fellow has to eat . That little trick helped me pay my bills . Oh , as if you 've ever paid a bill . Touche ! So , you have the ring ? No , they have the ring . They took it from me in Paris . No , Paracelsus has the ring . You have the Stone . Half the Stone . The Warehouse found the other half and lost it to pirates . Until I found it . So you have the Stone . No , they have the Stone . They have the Stone ? You just said you have the Stone . No , I said they have the Stone . Okay , okay , just stop ... Talking . Tell me that you know how to get to your half . Of course . I have it locked safely away . I want my son away from him . My brother had some plan in mind back then , but I interrupted . He 's bound to go at it again . He 's already killed hundreds . He 'll kill us and anyone else who gets in the way of his science . Yeah , well , first we have to find him . He 'll go to his lab . After 500 years , it 's still there ? It 's deep beneath the monastery in Stoudios , in Constantinople . The monastery 's in ruins but the lab is still intact . You 've been there , haven 't you ? Hmm . Claud , are you there ? This setup belonged to Barry Seal . He was a pilotldrug smuggler who flew covert missions for the CIA . Oh , my God ! Steve , can you hear me ? Yes , yeah , yeah , yeah . Claud , loud and clear . Are you okay ? Over . You mean aside from being the Tin Man in a bronze production of The Wizard of Oz , I 'm just peachy . What 's going on ? Where 's Paracelsus ? And why am I melting ? Well , technically you 're crumbling . I am working a Wizard of Oz motif here , Steve . God , why am I gayer than you ? Oh , hold on a sec , okay ? Look , I can 't reach Joshua . I know where he is , it 's not far but it 's a high security facility , so no cell service . Is there any way to contact him ? Well , not by phone but don 't worry , I 'm gonna get the DNA right now . Okay . Claud ... Hey , you 're , uh , your bronze state isn 't stable . It 's disintegrating . But Artie thinks he can use DNA to help you . He 's on his way to Joshua right now . Joshua 's DNA can un-bronze me ? No , no , but ... But Artie thinks he can use it to stop the deterioration . I feel this weirdness in my nerve endings . Is it getting worse ? No . No , you just hang in there , Claud . This monastery 's been destroyed and rebuilt at least a dozen times . I mean , how did you keep Paracelsus ' lab intact ? Bribery and coercion . I 've been trying for centuries to find a way to undo what Paracelsus did . You 're not the only one who loves our son . It 's not much farther . Main lab is just around this corner . Probably best if we come at him from both sides . Pete , you and Charlotte go this way . Sutton and I will loop around . Each team has half a Stone so if anyone gets caught we have bargaining power . Good luck . No ! Nick ? Hey ! Charlotte , wait . Mykes . Hey ! I lost Sutton . He heard the scream and he thought it was Nick . So did Charlotte . We got to find them before Paracelsus does . Right . This way ? Yeah . Oh , my God , Pete ! Look at this place . The bronzing artifact . Pete , look at this . It 's the Cavalry cross , the tree of life and the ouroboros . Life out of death . I bet there 's a pattern ... I 'll grab the stele . Pete , wait . You think that 's a ... A trap ? Pete ! Okay . Okay , I think I found something that will help . Not as good as DNA , but ... Maybe enough to save your haircut . Wait , my haircut 's in danger ? Maybe not , but I liked you better with short hair . I 've been trying to grow it out . Well , at least it hasn 't started on your nose yet . Oh , you 're not trying to grow that out , are you ? Whatever 's happening , I think it 's speeding up . I , I can 't feel my legs anymore , my chest is starting to hurt . So how about you hurry up with the slowing down . I figured that you 're oxidizing . So , I brought the binnacle from the USS Squalus . It 's a submarine that sank in 1939 . Now , a lot of the men survived 40 hours on a minimal amount of oxygen . So , I figure I 'm gonna use the binnacle to suck all the oxygen out of the bronzer , slowing down your deterioration . Jinksy , I 'm impressed ! Take it to periscope depth . Let 's give it a try . Damn it ! Steve . Oh , tell me that you got it . I got it . Okay . Hang in there , Claudia . I got the blood sample , atomized the DNA . Okay . Now we just watch and hope and you know , pray . Phew ! Claud ! Claud ! Artie stopped it . Woo-hoo ! I didn 't stop it . I just delayed it about 14 hours or so . Hopefully long enough for Myka and Pete to snag the stele . Ah ! Pete ! Pete , wake up . Where is he ? Who ? Where is he ? Where did he go ? Where 'd who go ? Paracelsus . He was ... He was here . Oh , no , Mykes . Mykes , the Stone ... The Stone ... He 's got the Stone . What ? How did he , uh ... How did he get in here ? I don 't know . I don 't know . I conked out . How do we get out of here ? Same way we got in . Nick , is that you ? Nick ! God ! Five hundred years together and still the perfect little family . You bastard ! Mother , don 't , don 't ... It 's Coleridge 's fishing net . He has far more dangerous artifacts than that . Listen to your son , Charlotte . He 's a bright lad . Now ... What was once mine is mine again . Be good and quiet . And I 'll make you mortal again . Breathe , my little lab rats . For centuries I was encased in bronze . Unable to think about a thing except my revenge . If you hadn 't gone to the authorities , my dear brother , the Warehouse would never have found me . And things would have turned out very differently . You took everything from me . Now I 'll take something from you . - Not Nick ! - No ! Hey ! Drop that ! The Warehouse is always so clever . But never clever enough ! - You , okay , Mykes ? - Yeah , go ! Not so fast , Senator Palpatine ! Look , Sutton , Nick , just try and get Charlotte out of here , okay ? I have to go get the stele . No ! Charlotte ? Nick ? Hey , Sutton ! Hey , you guys are mortal now . Falling buildings hurt . Hold on , Mother , just hold on . Oh , my God ! Guys , this whole place is collapsing . We 've got to get out of here . I 'm sorry , love . I 'm so sorry . I thought we had much more time . It 's all right . Just go . Just go . Get out of here . No , no , Mother . We can do this . I am sorry , but we have got to go . I 'm not leaving her . Oh , yes , you can . Just for once , just listen to me . Look after our son . Please . It 's what we 've wanted . It 's what we 've worked for all these years . You 've got a life . Live it now . Hey , I got the stele . We should ... Pete , is she ... Oh , my God ! I 'm so sorry . Nick , Sutton , I 'm so sorry but we have to go . We are running out of time . We have to go now ! - Let 's go ! - Nick ! Mother . Nick , go . Go ! I have spoken with the Regents . And we agree that the danger Paracelsus presents requires us to uncover what had been permanently expunged from the Warehouse files . How ... How can we ... As you know , information of this nature is held by the Keeper . The one person in each generation who learns vital parts of Warehouse history and maintains them in a living memory . Yes , the Keeper . The failsafe for highly classified secrets . We must meet him at once . There 's no need . The Keeper is here . I 'm sorry , Irene . It was necessary for my identity to remain a secret . I understand . There 's no need to apologize . This is a lei niho palaoa . Once worn by Hawaii 's Queen Kaahumanu . The ancestral hair that was used to braid it holds the memories of past Warehouses . And only the Keeper can release them . In the early days of Warehouse 9 , the alchemist Paracelsus was becoming a dangerous threat . Not only to the Warehouse but to all of mankind . It was therefore necessary for the Regents of Warehouse 9 to take action . Oh , my God ! It worked , you 're back ! You okay ? Here , Claud , here . Let me help you . Uh-huh . Yeah . You want my coat ? Here take my coat . Oh ! Okay . We could have lost Claudia . So , I 'm not gonna let you ignore it anymore . Ignore what ? You heard Sutton . He thought they had so much time . I mean , hell , we all do . We ... We think we have all the time in the world , but we don 't . We just don 't . You have ... Cancer . And you need to get it taken care of . Because I 'm not gonna play that scene , Myka . I 'm not gonna regret all the years that I didn 't get to spend with you . Okay . Okay . I 'll book an appointment with my doctor , okay ? All right . Just don 't . Okay ? Because I really , I don 't want to cry right now . So ... Okay . Just go . I 'll go . Okay . I 'm fine . I 'm fine . I 'm fine , guys . Really . And , Artie , please take your coat . Smells like old cookies . Claud ... What is it ? Something 's wrong . It 's not the bronzing . I ... It 's the Warehouse . Paracelsus , I can feel something about him . You 're feeling the peripheral effects of the same thing that 's affecting me quite strongly . The Eldunari ? How ? Two Caretakers vying for the Warehouse . I 'm in a battle . And I 'm losing . But you and Claudia coexisted peacefully for a long time . Ms. Donovan 's relationship with the Warehouse is in the future . This is about the past . And the past takes precedence . Paracelsus was Caretaker . Of Warehouse 9 . And as he gains strength I am ... I will ... Mrs. Frederic !

 We need to get out of the city . No tech , no printing . Look , we decided . We go underground , deep as we can . Who are you ? I don 't know . She 's a dumbshow . This is the way to safe haven . The chair ? The memories will tell us how to get there ? Home , sweet home . I need topher to put me in the chair . Back me up on a drive , hard copy . You 're copying yourself ? In case something happens to me , I know exactly where we 're going . Caroline ? Yeah . The butchers are coming . I hope we find me alive . Butchers ! Butchers ! Come on ! Move , move , move , move , move ! Go ! Go , go , go , go , Go , go , go , go , go , go ! Go ! Come on ! How are there butchers all the way up here ? We 're nowhere near a city . Locals , got hit with a blanket signal ? They were wearing suits . Yes . This was your finer class of mindless kill-zombie . Maybe they were on a corporate retreat . Who cares ? We still need water , and we 're low on gas . If we don 't get to safe haven soon ... Caroline , we 've been dodging the mobs for weeks . Are you sure we 're on the right track ? I think so . I don 't know . Last time I was up here , it wasn 't this bad . I could see over the dash . Whose body was this ? We don 't know . She was printed before we met her . We stuck your brain in her Because you 're supposed to be The great and terrible caroline , The one who knows how to save us . The tech works . In my camp - In safe haven - no one 's been imprinted since we set up . We still have a chance to make a true world . A true world ? Look around , tiny messiah - it 's over . Half the world 's been wiped ; the rest have turned Into crazies trying to kill the other half . There 's only a handful of actuals left , Which you , by the way , ain 't . We are lost . We are not gone . We stay in the hole another night ... Try again tomorrow . Is it going to be weird for you to meet yourself ? Face to your real face ? Nah , it 'll be sweet . You were one of those magically delicious super whores . I bet you look great . If I have to kick your ass again ... yeah . Let me see your ugly mug ... All right , that 's enough . Let 's not bruise the merchandise . Bring out the others . Where are we ? Neuropolis . The city of minds . Neuropolis exists ? Wait , what ? It used to be tucson . Rossum was run from here . And you just didn 't think to mention that safe haven Was parked right next door to the frickin ' death star ? ! It had to be . This is where we got the vaccine . We were raiding it for tech whenever we could . You were here before . So , what are they going to do with us ? Mmm , yeah . Mr. Harding . What is it now ? I 'm eating . Of course you are , sir . Watch it . You said you want a new suit . We have a few for you to choose from . Oh ! Well , It 's about time . Can 't believe I let this one get so stretched out . You 'd be just as fat , ambrose , If we hadn 't of run out of shellfish . True , but we 're having a hard time Finding acceptable replacement bodies In the chaos out there . Got to start taking better care of ourselves . You 're right . This time , I will . Going to start on the elliptical . Where did this body come from ? He 's a dumbshow . Poachers caught him in the wild . Was he with anyone ? Just some girl . Oh , idiot ! What 's the matter with him ? Couple dumbshows never hurt anybody . This is worse than butchers . By at least a lot . It 'll be okay . Oh , what , you got a plan , wunderkind ? I guess I do . Echo . Still living the dream , harding ? It is a little bit tarnished . You ever think if you didn 't cut off rossum At the head , The tech might never have gotten out of control ? Yeah . You 're a model of control , butterball . At least I 'm having some fun . Please . You know I 'm backed up . Why do you bother anymore ? Ask me again sometime . Does anyone need medical ? Paul . Over here . You do your doctor thing . I 'll find him . She 's lost a lot of blood . She 's in hypovolemic shock . The brachial artery ... It 's healed up , but we need to find oxygen . Or an iv - supplement the remaining blood supply . Here . Let me give you a hand . Where 'd you learn that trick ? Same place you did . Topher . No ! No , no . No ! No . No . I mean , yes . Yes , yes , yes . I - I 've been ... I 've been working . I ... I 've been working . Hard at working . Please don 't use a bullet . Don 't want to waste . It 's paul . I 'm here with echo . Echo . Yes . One bullet a day . Don 't want to waste . One person down a day until I solve the problem . They shoot someone if you don 't invent what they want ? What they need . Every day , a chain reaction . Erase the world all at once . How is he ? He 's pretty far gone . The prisoners ? One of them is me . Okay . I think harding was making him build something To wipe the whole planet . To solve the problem . But people die if I do or I don 't . A new problem , chain reaction . Hey , topher , it 's me . We 're getting you out of here . I 'm so close . I 'm so close , so close to solving both problems . They would have no idea . Close to what ? Wiping everyone ? The opposite . A reflection , like an echo . Put things back the way they were - Minds back the way they were . I can bring back the world . Come and look at this . Told you it 'd be worth the wait . Awesome . Do you want to go show your mum ? Yeah . Gently . Hey , mom ! Hey , mom . Look , the strawberries are ripe . Oh , wow . Those look amazing . Try one . Go ahead . You can trust your mom . Let 's save the rest for dessert , huh ? Come here . Are these from the east house ? Hill house . They need help finishing the well In the next few days . Clearly , if this is all they 're producing . - Echo . - Topher collapsed . About a half mile back . He 's malnourished . Needs water . Go . Topher ? We got him . They were trying To get topher to build a pulse bomb , Send out some kind of chain-reacting blanket signal , - Wipe everyone . - Everyone in the world ? Who 's left ? We came out of l.A. I 'm amazed you survived . Well , hold your applause . There were 30 of us when we banded . Who 's worth wiping anymore ? Maybe a group overseas , maybe us . Maybe they 're getting tired Of me killing them all the time . Aren 't you ? Thanks for the insight , mini-me , But you missed the last quarter of this game . We 're not ahead . The point is : Topher thinks he can flip it , Create a pulse to restore - All the wiped minds . - Yeah ? He also thinks He 's a little teapot , short and stout . Topher brink is a genius , And you will keep a civil tongue In this house , or we 'll put it in the stew . Good to see you 've mellowed ... At did they do to him ? They shot someone in front of him Every day he didn 't finish . We don 't really eat people 's tongues . Cool . I 've got a rocket scientist or two in here . They 're not topher 's league , but I don 't think It 's a fantasy . The science seems sound . But what would it mean ? Butchers , dumbshows , Everyone who 's ever been wiped or imprinted Would go back to their original identities . Including us . Aw , you finally get to be a real girl . - It sounds so simple . - It 's not . Anyone with active architecture , we 'd be reset , too , Back before it all started . We 'd forget ... Everything . Some of us can afford that , But a lot of us can 't , and topher doesn 't have everything He needs . This is where it gets interesting . It was dull ? To avoid The blast and any reverberation , we 'd have to go Deep underground for a year or more , And what topher needs To make the pulse work ... Is in the dollhouse . Oh , come on ! I guess there really is no place like home . Hey , hey , we just left that party . That party was on fire . We need a guide , and you two know The city better than any of us . I thought there was a vaccine . You said there was a vaccine . There was , But this is new . Zone , power down a sec . Think about what this means . It means everything , And somebody 's got to step up . The world still needs heroes , kid . Did you really just say that ? what ? I was being inspirational . You are so corny . You 're ... Fat . Enough with the pep talk . We need to get back . You 're going to show us the way , or ... She said you don 't eat tongues . Maybe she should start . I have listened to you whine for way too long , zone . This is bigger than us . Fine , then you take ' em . Oh , you can send me a postcard Once we 've reestablished some sort of postal system Due to your heroics . She loves it when you 're corny . Look , for your 411 , I 'm not some printed freak . A - and the pulse - it doesn 't affect actuals , right ? So I 'm not heading back into the ... what 's that sound ? I thought you said you weren 't followed . The main gate . A raiding party . T , come here right now . Kut ! Naz-pas ! Bil-dah-has-tanh-ya . Silago-keh-goh ? Do-ya-sho-da . Nell-hectic-de-ne . Ahl-neh ah-hi-dig-flail ? Sorry , english . I got your message . How can we help ? sorry if you don 't like our methods . We like to take the offensive . Most people have a " shoot first " policy . Us included . Romeo , you want to help with this , Or you want to play in the sandbox ? But why him ? I sent word with some of the actuals we set free . It was a long shot , I thought ... But he 's out of control . They 're freakshows . Tech heads - exactly the sort of thing I 'm trying to keep t away from . They 're our only chance of making it back through the wild . But I don 't want to go back . I don 't want to leave our home , go down that hole . It 's not my idea of a vacation spot either . It 's just the next thing . Do I have to cut your throat ? What are you doing with the boy ? Showing him my mods , vic . No , no tech in front of the kid . Do I have to upload that to your brain myself ? I got it . Log off . Easy . You know , you can stay . I 'll do the job . Come on . Just takes me a while to process things , during which I yell . I get what 's at stake . Who doesn 't want to spend some quality time with these Awesomely normal people ? I don 't know . Could be all right . The little asian 's kind of cute . She 's a tech head , mag . She 's a girl , mag . It 's good to see him productive again . It is . Yes , and who are you ? I 'm caro - I 'm in the ... I 'm just some kid . Damn , you 're twitchy . You don 't like girls ? Apparently , everyone does . I don 't care for the tech . So you 're the , uh , weapons expert ? That-that 's what that says , yeah . So , um , What , you got to load that every time ? You can 't just store it ? Not unless you 're echo . We want to stay sane , We got to take something out first , make room For it . Take out what ? That 's great . how long have we been on the road ? Couple of hours . How 's the kid doing ? You can call him t . He sleeps better than I do , that 's for sure . The garden - looks like it came a long way since I last saw it . Three summers ago ? We 've had some time to get it right . I just mean ... I understand it would be hard to leave . It was our home ... Away from all the horror . Now I 'm condemning him to that house , That hell I was locked up in For so many years . So you can remember him , remember raising him . How ironic . You 'd have to kill me to take those memories . But I wanted him brought up Away from all the crap in the back of this truck . Well , we both did . That 's why we agreed Never to tell him , to keep him away from me . We agreed to keep him away from the tech . You chose to stay steeped in it , tony , Seduced by it . You chose to be victor . For our cause . For your cause . I stopped fighting long ago . I was fighting to protect you . I would do anything for you , for both of you . Except the one thing I asked you to do . Man , you 're gonna be hilarious stuck underground for a year . We 're not there yet . We 'll get there . This thing works , rossum is really going down . Ambrose , harding - they 'll just be hard drives on a shelf . Yeah , and someone 's going to have to smash those drives . Which is why we 're staying down till we know we 're safe . You keep bringing that up . Because you keep pushing it down . You think after the pulse , The world 's going to be all hunky-dory ? I think it 's not your fight . I think , for a good long while , You 're going to have to be where you are , And I think that scares you . Ugh , I hate when you pretend to know me . That 's not a claim I 'd make . I 've been knocking ten years , you still won 't let me in . I 've let you in a few times . When you were sure we were gonna die . What happens if you 're sure we 're going to live ? What do you think happens ? No , no , come on , you 're my analyst now , So tell me what you think . I think you 've got a hundred people Living inside your head ... And you 're the loneliest person I know . That 's kind of sweet . Not for the person who 's with you . We 're going to enter here - Through the union plaza metro station - the service tunnels . The butchers have killed most everyone in the city And run out of food , So , they 're thinning out . No , they got food . We saw one eating His friend the other day . Eww , but it still means there 's less of them . It also means the strongest Survived . Super butchers . Grand . Look alive , people , we 're almost there . I 'll get us as close as I can . I thought you said there weren 't many left . There aren 't . But they 're all here . ready ? We were born ready . Well , not technically . Yankee ! Paul ! Let 's go . Move ' em out . Move ! Go ! We got ' em underground . Move in ! Move in ! Everyone , into the tunnel ! Now ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Hey , hey , hey , it 's okay . You 're gonna be ... Zone ! That 's all of us . Seal the door behind us . What about ... That 's all of us ! We go down here . Wait ! Last time we were here , Your zombie day spa was crawling with butchers . We need to drop some c-4 down the rabbit hole . Then we risk destroying the tech that topher 's looking for . If there were any butchers down there , They 've probably torn each other apart . Let 's find out . I try to be my best . Aw , hell . Nope . You 'll have to keep digging , If that 's where you want to end up . Alpha . Thought we lost you in reno . I kinda let you think that . I lost my stomach for the fight . Thought I 'd help out some people could use it . Cleared this place out . No wonder there 's so many butchers up there . They know about the dumbshow buffet . Victor ? Why would someone do something so horrible to your face ? Psycho . Lapsed . We 've got wounded . Get mag down here . I 'll prep the meds . Where 's big bad ballard ? We lost him . Man , I 'm sorry . When did that happen ? Ten minutes ago . Tell me where to look , darling . Some things aren 't on the cartesian plane . Is the tech You 're looking for in the lab ? The pineal gland ! The seat of consciousness . I made it the seat of destruction . How many people do you think can sit on it before it breaks ? You don 't mean the chair , do you ? No . No , no , no , no , no , no , no . What if there wasn 't anything ? Then we took a road trip for nothing . We 'd be okay with that . What on earth do you think you 're doing ? We came here for some juicy new prints . Not to let you take our world away . You stay down here , You 'll be shielded just like us . You can stay who you are . The ohm resistance of ten meters of concrete is the equivalent ... We changed ourselves to survive up there . To thrive . Even if we don 't get wiped by the pulse , You 're still destroying who we are . I 've taken down guys twice as bad as you With guns twice as big . Our guns aren 't pointed at you , sister . No . Told him Again and again and again , guns don 't help me think . They just don 't help me think . I can take ' em . You 'll get him killed . What 's going on , rome ? Upgrades , vic . Tell me you haven 't thought about it . Hold up . We tweaked ourselves to fight the war . - It 's ending . - Not anymore . Not if they don 't have him . And with all the tweaks on this computer , We 'll rule the wasteland . Why wouldn 't you want that ? Because we 're not freakshows . Well , okay , maybe I am . And echo . Topher 's a little off . But adelle - she 's a class act All the way . Alpha . It 's just that I have worked so hard to have a peaceful Life here . It 's harder for me than most . Hey ... I get it . You think I don 't want every one of those skills Firing through my head ? I know how good it feels . Skip learning the hard way . Skip the long hours ... The sweat , the training . Just to feel the thrill of perfection . But if we 're going to rebuild the world , I want to do it myself . Sorry , boss , That means you stand with the luddites . Did he just call me a luddite ? Looking for these ? We 'll take him to the holding cell . The tiny one to medical . Figure out what to do with them after we set off the emp . Let 's go , romeo . Oh , god , she 's so cool . It 's okay . It 's okay . Everything 's going to be okay . He 's tired . He 's much worse when he 's tired . Tired ? Bedtime . It was like this when I bought the place . Kill your idols . There 's a piece of tth . Well , I 'm very glad you didn 't clean up . Yeah , it spoke to the schizophrenic in me . Hmm . Well , both of them , actually . He didn 't come back for the tech . He came back for an idea . A synapse fires and I find a solution before the problem . How many times has " b " come before " a " ? " sniper . " " demolition . " " ernesto . " He gave it up , priya . He knew he couldn 't take you . And he 'll be back for these , I guarantee it . Well ... Let him ! Priya ! Wonder if I 'm in here somewhere . " memory of priya . " Pulls it out of his head , along with " being human . " What the hell is wrong with you ? This ! This tech has been eating at my life ... He 's in love with you ! Are you really that thick ? This isn 't something that comes on a drive . They tried to pull it out of him . They wiped his mind for years , and he never stopped loving you ! You want to kill the tech ? Kill it ! Shut it down ! Lock him out ! Give him nothing ! You can string him along for years . You 've got years together and what you should do is waste it ! Never tell him that you love him . Never tell him that you 're grateful for him ! He 's dead ! He 's dead ! He 's just ... Dead ! I never told him . Paul 's dead . And I 'm alone . I 'm all alone , I 'm always alone . Paul . Welcome to lecture one in a three-part series entitled " neuroplasticity in relation to cortical imprinting . " Her face has a look about her . The most effective way to imprint new pathways Is with a timed electrostatic charge . It simulates the natural rewiring process of the brain . Basic neuroplasticity - Every action affects our neural topography . We literally become what we do , Not what we 've done or what we will do . We 're best defined by our actions in the moment . With a wavelength of more than two meters , Little damage is done to the surrounding tissue . Thank you . Greater than two meters . The connection goes there . I know . Does this mean we 're finished ? Where do we set off the device ? High up , higher up . Higher , the better . Gamma rays bounce off the atmosphere . Is my old office high enough ? Yes , yes , yes , perfect . It 'll hit the stratosphere . A minor explosion cascades into a major chain reaction . Explosion ? It does the work for you . You said it could only be activated manually . You 're not coming back . Small price to pay . I didn 't want to cause any more pain . Is now a bad time to ask for a favor ? I 've got something on my mind . T ... I 'd like you to meet your father . Go on . Hey . I 'm anthony . But , uh , you can call me tony . That 's my name , too . Yeah . Can I help you burn stuff ? You don 't have to do it , you know . At least not alone . I do . I 'll fix what we did to their heads . You fix what we did to the rest of the world . Your job is way harder . Man ... You don 't waste any time . Shut up . I don 't have to . I 'm going . Our tiny messiah 's gonna be a ten-year-old soon . Somebody 's gotta look after her . Caroline told me . And you , stumpy , are going nowhere . Except maybe down . Take care of her , zone . Try not to have any influence on her of any kind . And , you know , look us up in a year or two . Not if you paid me . Mag ... What , uh , what 'd you do ? You know , before . I was at berkeley . Sociology . You ? Landscape architect . Would never have called that one . People are such a mystery . Alpha just left ? He said he couldn 't stay , And if he was going to become what he was before ... He won 't . He 's evolved , he will again . Well , I think he 'd like to be alone when he finds out . Just in case . And the rest of them ? I 'll lead them out , Make sure they all come through the pulse all right . I 'm really the only one who can . Ever the shepherd , huh ? Leading them into the light . For good . Funny that the last fantasy the Dollhouse should fulfill ... Would be yours . I don 't have any fantasies , adelle . More 's the pity . Alpha said to dismantle all the tech in the building . He said you should start with the chair . Having second thoughts ? No way . I 'm the lucky one . I get to start over . what happened ? It 's a long story , kid . Am I ... Are we ... You wanted me to let you in . You sure you got room ? I got a lot of baggage . Childhood stuff . We 'll work through it . We 've got time .

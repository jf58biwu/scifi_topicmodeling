There 's the reason . You mean Mr. Finch ? - Felix sucks Finch . He ​ ​ has my book in his magazine ridiculed . So bad was it not ? - No ? Mr. Hoggins would have to apologize ... For the inflated autobioroman ... 400 pages of gibberish that void to an end ... Full of nonsense and vulgarity , that is hard to beat . Relax , Dermot . A critic is simply someone who quickly ... And arrogant , but never wisely read . Fuck him . Ladies and gentlemen . Is an award tonight . The price for the main and best critic . Sir , I apologize , Sir Felix Finch . And where is my prize ? A signed copy of " Knuckle Sandwich " ? There are not many of them . Well ? What does that stubby pencil , that your imagination calls in mind ... This scene to end ? It will determine your liking . That 's a flat and senseless end , not to surpass . What I felt ? If I 'm honest ... Went emotions such as shock and dismay , same way as Finch . She gone quickly . - Tequila . Two fingers high . While I felt deep in my heart ... How this tragic incident a silver glow on the horizon gave . In a night was Dermot Dusty Hoggings ... The cult hero of the common man . Grabbed the critic and threw him over the railing . From ' Knuckle Sandwich ' were ... In less than two months 90,000 pieces sold . For a brief moment I was Cinderella ...

Family , brothers , half-and even strangers Abbess came to see ... And worshiped her , as if Sonmi itself in our kitchen Sat There were questions about the Prescients and their great ship made . How can you ship as quietly and silently float ? Fusion Engines . No one asked what fusion engines were , because they did not want to be kept ignorant .

Best Sixsmith , I your help urgently . My last letter certainly brought you ... Pack your bags went . But that 's not necessary . Unless you want to witness the rebirth of Robert Frobisher . Is not it surprising how fate can change so suddenly ? One minute I flee from the window of a hotel ... And the next moment I am working ... Of one of the major composers in the world . My only problem is that I 'm fascinated ... By the diary of a dying lawyer ... In 1849 on an island in the Pacific ... Traveled to San Francisco . To my chagrin stops the book in the middle of a sentence . I miss half the book , it makes me crazy . Do you deliver me from and the next time ... To ask , when you get to 'Otto 's books ' are ?

Doctor Sixsmith ? - I need help . I need 50,000 . No 2,000 , but 50,000 . I would still look twice , But the amount true : £ 2,343 and 16 cents . That can not be right , the money poured . It is through the debt has teerd . Everything has its dark side . The situation looked serious , but I knew ... That the capital of Timothy Cavendish in this city ... Not by the number of an accountant had calculated . McCluskie , how are your kids ? With Cavendish , with your dear old Timothy ... You heard right , an original Charles Dickens desk for 60,000 pounds . A very fair price . This office is located in the Dickens Museum . And what about the Office of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ? Suddenly I saw a light in the darkness . Blood is thicker than water since time immemorial . If Hoggins the case to family business would explain ... Then the Cavendish Clan more than ready . No , huh . Not you again . Get out , leave us alone . I ask once friendly . Nice to see you , Denny . I 'll lend you a cent , as long you still blame me have . Why do I always give money ? I had disagreements with the wrong people . If I do not £ 60,000 together can get ... I get a sharp spanking . - Let there be a video of it for me . Now fuck off . - I 'm serious , Denny . Why is that my problem ? - Because we 're brothers . Have you no conscience ? A few of my pills and a gin and tonic give me comfort . Denny , help me . Please . Who you talking to ? Hello , Georgette . - Hi , Timothy . Okay . How much ? 60 grand ? It will take a while ... But until then , I have the perfect hideaway for you . I 'm afraid my beloved Tilda never in the arms will hold . At night I suffer from the parasite and I have terrible cramps ... While obscene and monstrous visions and voices haunt me . My god . Mr. Ewing , do not be afraid . You are not in danger . Not recall . Please . My name Autua . You know me . You have seen I whipped . You know me . What do you want ? - Your help , Mr. Ewing . If you do not help me ... I 'm in danger . - You are now in danger . The Prophetess is a merchant ship ... And no flight vehicle for escaped slaves . I am a good sailor , I work for my trip . Then I suggest you ... You at the mercy of the captain narrates . No , they do not listen to me . They say : " Swim to house nigger . " And throw me to the fish . You 're a cop , right ? Please . The captain will listen to you , Mr. Ewing . - I can not help you . Your destiny is in your hands , not me mine . Kill me . - That 's absurd . If you do not help me , kill me . This is the same , you know . I 'm not a fish , Mr. Ewing . Here death is better . Do it . Do it quickly . I found an old road , Captain . That must be the good mountain . The problem is that the mountain people are afraid of it . They think the devil lives up there . I can not find anyone ... To me by the area of ​ ​ Kuna wants to lead . Meronym , out every day increases your radiation . Your dream will ever kill you . And for what ? The otherworldly colonies might not exist anymore . I have to go , Captain . Thank you for coming are . I 'm in room 1404 . I 'm so upstairs . Dr. Sixsmith ? Dr. Sixsmith ? I , Luisa . Call the police . Fast . Best Sixsmith . Only you know what I feel now . Today Ayrs and I our first joint work ... To Tadeusz Kesselring submitted . The favorite conductor of Arys , from Berlin . It 's called ' Eternal Return ' . I wish you could hear . It 's the best piece since the war ... And I tell you , more than a few good ideas come from me . On our mature age , dear Ayrs ... A man has no right to such bold ideas . I have in my fight against the inadequacy apparently won a few battles . For dinner we had pheasant with butter cream and burgundy . I love it when great men ... Old follies and heroic deeds tell . The only discordant note of the evening was ... When Mrs. Jocasta sooner retired . I sensed that something was concealed . Later I asked Ayrs forward . He said Kesselring him Jocasta had proposed . I was wondering if Kesselring ever been in love with her ? Apparently a sensitive subject . - Jocasta is Jewish . That made a relationship course impossible . Course ? Are you really so ignorant that you do not know what 's going on in Germany ? If I know anything , Sixsmith , it 's ... That this world runs on the same invisible forces ... Also confuse our hearts . How you doing , Zachry . - As always . Can I keep you company ? - Yes , but ... Goat herders and are not known for their talkativeness . I must apologize ... I without your permission in your house . I 'm very sorry . - Forget it . It 's done . Do you mind if if a stranger asks for your life ? An exchange . Question by question . Why not . - I guess ... You do not want to learn milking and goat herding . Why are you here ? - I am looking for a guide . A guide ? Where to ? Mauna Kea . The bridge is broken , hide underneath . What is it ? We cross over again our old jobs as figure skaters . While I read a new manuscript ... I got an intense déjà vu . I had been here before . In another life . Ursula . The love of my life . I can not imagine another serious candidate . What had become of her ? And especially ... What had become of the young man , ever in this train ... Poems to his soul mate and lover wrote ? The prediction was correct . The bridge was broken , like you said . Meronym said she wants to Mauna Kea . Why is that woman change my life and curse ? Remember the words of Sonmi . 'Our lives are not ours . ' 'From the cradle to the grave we are connected to others . " " In the past and in the future . " " And with any crime ... ' ' and every good deed , make our future . " Welcome to town . Come out . It is probably the biggest mistake of my life , but ... Thank you , Mr. Ewing . To be honest , I was afraid you would eat me , if you got nothing in your stomach . You are safe , Mr. Ewing . I do not eat white meat . Good . But before I decide what I do with you ... You tell me why you who whipped . My uncle was a sailor . When I was ten , he took me on a whaler . I 've seen too much of the world . I 'm not a good slave . Why you looking at me ? The pain is strong . But the eyes of a friend are stronger . You 're an escaped slave and I 'm a lawyer . How do you like we can be friends ? That 's all we need . How often have I told that you do not have to jump on my balcony ? Why do you always open the door if you do not want me to come in ? It 's bad that you jump on my balcony ... But it would be worse if you insist jumps and beyond stuck . What are you reading ? What old letters . Sixsmith , my story has a turn . Last week Jocasta and I became lovers . But do not worry , it 's just a physical service that I grant . Just like my role as an assistant . I must confess that the hearts of women ... Remain a mystery to me . Afterwards she cried and thanked me I live again in her house have brought . What I made clear that Vyvyan was there the whole night at . Between us , as the rest between two notes ... The key to more music . PS The best news of all : I 'm an own work began . I have an old record called . Composed by Robert Frobisher ? Oops , caught . I know that I had not been allowed to establish , but I wanted to check for scratches . But honestly ... I can not turn off . Is that Cloud Atlas Sextet ? The symphony . Beautiful , but I 've already heard . I can not imagine . There are ... A few instances of in North America . But I know it . I 'm sure . Before I had in mind , I brought my feet to the sacrificial temple ... I 've lost my innocence . Back to the four days in paradise ... When the parents of Ursula ... For a long weekend went to Greece . So we thought anyway . Ursula . Please ... I assure you that it is totally innocent . Two bruised ankles and a broken rib . Official cause according hospital report ... Pussy . What were the chances that they still lived in the house ? And yet , there she was . Ursula . Why did I ... Her calls and letters never answered ? Out of shame and spinelessness . The characteristics of the Cavendish Clan . I understood that I had the choice . I could sneak out and go travel as planned ... Or I could go to the door and see if there is still hope for me . Abbess , come quickly . It is the small Bailey . Catkin ? - She 's dying . What happened ? Sonmi . - Scorpion . The healer says she at sunset dead . It is not good and not fair , but we can do nothing . Stay still . The terminatielading sitting here . Artery Enough to tear them apart . How does it feel ? Good . Catkin is dying . She stepped on a scorpion . You can save her life . You have stuff in your bag that can save her . The Council has Prescients rules . I must of them do not always holy Sonmi play ... If fate turns against us . I 'm just a goatherd , but doing nothing dies Catkin . If I had left on that bridge , you 'd be food for the Kuna . If a prescient on the ground would be , with poison in her heart and lungs ... If there was one of your kind ... Why are we less worth than Prescients ? I bring you to the mountain . I know the way . If you Catkin saves ... I lead you through even the gates of hell . Even if past us with sirens lures ... I liked it better for the price ... My brother Denny pointed me to hold . Here signs , please . And tomorrow life could begin again . This way . This is the old Seoul . If the water continues to rise as , then state Seoul within one hundred years under water . Your food is here . It 's not what you 're used to , but you 'll find it tasty . This is your bed . These are your clothes . From Me ? But these are thoroughbred clothes . No , they 're yours . Did you know he was in the Union ? - No , but it had not mattered . Why not ? Because it was the first time that a thoroughbred nice to me . Mom ? I 'm hungry . Like it ? You look beautiful . Come . Come sit . This thing played videos , but the chip is broken . Just kept hanging so I deciphered it and took the rest . The rest ?

The moment you stop searching , it comes . You 're naive , Robert . I 'm anything but . - There is a gap between the seats . What you want is no different than what I want . The gap is an illusion . How do I describe that night , Sixsmith ? What happened between me and Vyvyan , transcended language . There was music behind his eyes away . It breathed from his lips . Such beautiful music I had never heard . What are you doing here ? They found us . I stay the whole time you . Focus on me . Stay with me . I will not let go . It 's good . I have spoken with the captain . He will hear you . What 's your name , boy ? - Autua , sir . This Christian gentleman , knows nothing of ships ... Tells me you 're a first-class sailor ? Okay . Let 's see how the mainsail lowering . Mr. Boerhaave , get my gun ready . You gave me your word . You can not do this . Nobody tells me what I can and can not do on my ship . Especially if the negro stowaways concerns . Look at that . He hooks at his feet . Mr. Boerhaave , do not mess on my deck . Captain , please . Hear me . The dark is as salty as me . It seems that we have a new crewmember . Make sure he does . Mr. Hooks ? I found her . She was in the chemielab , looking for the toilet . Fine then . Why do you take not from here , Sachs ? Knowledge you to our tribe Miss Rey and guide you through the tower . The funny thing is that I 'm not even supposed to be . I have been in Seoul , but the traffic stopped ... So I leave tonight only . Do you ever that the universe is against you ? Always . Do you mind ? - Nope . You look nervous . Do I make you nervous ? - No . Contrary . May I know why you lied to me ? Freedom , the silly ditty of our civilization . Only those who are not free know what it means . There is contradiction about what should happen to you . The Corpocraten want you euthanize , as dissident . Maker requires a period of study . The genomicisten like cerebral vivisection . The problem that you cause is political . And that makes it my problem . I find it fascinating that behind this ... Perfectly constructed face thoughts houses ... Unanimity who instill fear . I 'm not afraid of such thoughts , because I the truth is not shy . The world follows a natural order . And the truth is , that this order be protected . Light the Archivist in and prepared her for the exclusion . Understood . - Sir ? Can you tell me what with Hae-Joo happened ? Kill , I 'm told . All the excitement you too much . You need rest . I once had a girlfriend . She tried Carlos Castaneda to read . Have you ever read that shit ? - Yes . The relationship was doomed to fail . Each time that they ... Karma-past-hassle came up , I could not contain my laughter . And yet ... I can not explain ... But I knew when I opened that door ... They have the most copies of the report destroyed . Most ? There is not a good choice . If I help you , I can lose my job . Or worse ... If I do not , will be a lot of people ... It will be worse than bad . You should do , not what you can not do . Nibbles anything to you ? You really are not afraid to Old Georgie meet ? I fear the weather over that old devil . Do you think he does not exist ? Who has the Fall drop as the Old Georgie was not ? The True-true ? The Ancients . This is nonsense . The ancients were smart . They conquered diseases they performed miracles and flew through the air . All true , but she obtained otherwise . A desire in their hearts . A desire stronger than all their cleverness . Desire for what ? A desire for more . Faith , like fear or love ... Is a force that must be understood , as we understand the theory of relativity ... And principles of uncertainty . Phenomena that the course of our lives determine . Yesterday was my life one way . Today it is the other way . I think yesterday I had never done , what I did today . These forces , which are often time and space rewrite ... Another person can create which we imagine to be ... Begin long before we were born and continue after our death . Our lives and our choices ... Like quantum trajectories , from time to time include ... And every crossroads , every encounter ... Suggests a new potential direction . Assertion : I 'm in love become Luisa Rey . Is this possible ? I know its just yet ... I feel that something important has happened to me . That 's it . The music from my dream . This is from my dream . That evening when I came to your room . This is the music that I heard in my head . In one way or another I gave it to you . I have been working for weeks on this piece . I think you heard and incorporated into your dream . I call it " The Cloud Atlas Sextet " . This is clearly the result of our collaboration . The Atlas ... Is the only thing in my life which has value . Yet I know I did not write ... If I had not met . There are pieces I wrote where we meet ... Would meet again in different lives ... And different ages . - Yes . Something as important as this , can not be seen by you or me . It 's ours . So I feel it , Vyvyan . I 'm sorry , I thought ... - What were you thinking ? That I flirting with a young guy like you or would like it ? I will pack my bags and I 'm gone by morning . You do not . You go away alone when I say that you can go . You will continue to work to Vyvyan Ayrs Cloud Atlas . When it 's done , I decide what I 'm doing . - You can keep me here . I 'm leaving . Good luck with your composing . I 'm sure a sterile old goat like you ... Still something memorable can make . Think about it , Robert . Think of reputation . Reputation is everything in our society . That ... Yours , my disinherited outcast , has expired . Did you really think we knew nothing of someone who lives with us ? Mackerras wrote and I quote : 'He is a prostitute whose relationships with perverts and sodomites ... Were commonplace in his short career in and forget optional Caius . Connect the silverware on . End of quote . Be warned , leaving without my permission ... And the entire musical society will know of the degenerated Robert Frobishe . And even if you 're one of the greatest songs ever writes ... Nobody will listen , because nobody wants anything to do with you . I will not let you go again . I told you he 'd come . Two things were clear : Myself ophangend to Edingboroughs flagpoles ... Was better than that parasite ... Longer abuse made my talents . I have to finish my Sextet . I can not do it , so I escape tonight . Each outbreak is a risky proposal . A little mistake and we have to dance at her feet . I know . We might use code names , but I would like first of forgotten me . Well , Mr. Cavendish , Ernie Blacksmith . These are Mr. Meeks and Veronica Costello . On trust . - On trust . I know . And the parrot ? You never know what he repeats . Mr. Meeks is a decent and honorable gentleman . He ​ ​ would never betray us . Nobody had ever heard anything else . I know . The question is , old man , are you trustworthy ? Unity requires compliance . We have a code red . We come aboard . What you gonna do ? - Stay calm . It will end in tears . You warned me . I guess I 'm just as hopeless as Adam Ewing ... Not aware of all ... Unspeakable forms of lying and waiting . Lying to the fact that his friend poisons . The idea of ​ ​ this ring to lose makes me more than stuffy . Do not be silly , Adam . I know your wife ... Prefers your health above a gold loop . I have seen the effects and it 's not a pretty sight . I know a good Spanish goldsmith ... So that monter works your Tilda not even ... Will realize that he has been disconnected . Give to me . - Keep your hands off my pudding . It 's not your pudding , you Alzheimer 's patient . You have your pudding already . Give it to me . You better come here . Fucking crazy . Did you sometimes that you can handle me ? The room smelled like medicine . Pretty heavy stuff , guns . Why I picked it exactly ? No idea . Intuition . A sense of meaning . From now on ... There was no turning back . The Sussin is almost in the clouds . We have not much time . I do not need Smart Rope . - Yes . If you fall ... I catch you . Hands up . - Now . Step out of the vehicle . - Down . Down , now . Where are you hiding these substances ? He is definitely illegal . I read a second life form . - Where ? In the truck . - Find out . Yes , sir . You are now demonic grounds , valle iman . I say it only once . The alien is not at the top . Let go of that rope . You offender . You pay the price ... Now that rope . Team a go in the truck . - Understood . That 's her . - Everything is good . I 'm hit . Who are you ? - Commander Hae-Chang Joo . First Science Officer of the Rebel Union . Why are you doing this ? Because I believe you have the power to change this world . I 'm not letting go . Thanks , Zachry . You got me twice now saved . - If you fall , I catch you . Active source confirms . Stop them now . What are you doing , boy ? I thought I was clear . Do what you want , but I 'm leaving . Prima , Frobisher . Go . But I love this . Give that back . - It 's mine . I 'm warning you . According to the terms of this relationship , I fully within my rights . Give it back or I swear I shoot you now . You 're a coward . - I 'll do it . You pull that trigger no . Your kind never does . The Diary of Adam Ewing Help yourself home today . I 'm afraid it eats me . - Nonsense . You need to your lovely wife . You have to think Tilda . We 've traced . We have them . What are you doing ? Come on . The dead do not stay dead . Open your ears and they will never stop whining . What is this place ? For the defeat ... Ancients built the houses in the sky ... Between the stars . This place is connected with it . Sonmi ? She is . Beds Somni the ancients as to as the valley people ? No , not the same . Stay close to me . Manufacturers are caught here . Everything is safe . - Thank you . Is all well . We 're partners . But you have to tell me what 's going on . I pull clothes off , call the police and promise you all tomorrow to tell . Well , I hope you realize you just ... Said exactly what each character in each mystery ... Says before she slain . - Good night , Xavier . What did you get down there ? The ancients worshiped Sonmi . This is not exactly the same . They were different . Otherwise , how ? You want the truth ? Here you live ? - Here is born the Union . Sonmi is no God . She died hundreds of years back on an island . What ? I know what people believed the valley . I know that they thought that Somni a miracle . That they are born of God was smart , but it is not the truth . Her life was sad and treacherous . She died as she wanted to change the ancients . Lies . Nothing but lies . You 're lying . The nature of our immortal life ... - Sonmi . Before she died , she spoke about her doings . Her words make me remember what the truth is . How long have accompanied you listening ? How long are you still standing there ... You let a stranger you do not doubt your faith . Zachry ? Everything good ? Make Sussin off . If I wanted you dead , you 'd be dead . I hurt you . I just want to talk . Stay calm . If I wanted you dead , you had already been . How do you like that ? Great conversation , right ? You are Lester Rey 's daughter , sure . You knew my father ? - Korean War , I was in the 21th . That 's me on the left . Besides your father . The bombs fell so close that she on my ass could fall . If your father had not done what he did , I had not been here . Then we shook hands . You have not let go of the rope ... Because you 're mad at that dark sweet meat . I 'm beginning to understand . This coconut whore with her skin ... And with her cunning mask she wins your confidence ... And bring you here . She plays you . And what , fool ? They want that island . The Precients want everything . You deny your own people . For a part of her . It is not part of your tribe . You do not even have the same color . This Jezebel ignores your values . She plays with your hair lies ... And you run like a lap dog after her . That 's not true . - Then do something to stop her ... Suit your nail and cut her throat . Protect your tribe , grab her now . Grab her before it 's too late . They will kill you . I know these people better than you . To tell me that you come a little too late . Someone forced me to of the Swannekkebrug to drive . This is going too far . You know who it was ? - An assassin , Bill Smoke ... And ... - And what ? He killed Sacks . - Isaac ? A bomb in his plane . The press said it was the PLO . He was a threat , such as Sixsmith and you . Let them through . Somni 451 , it 's a pleasure to meet you . I am General An-Kor Apis , leader of the Union . Who is paying him ? Same which I also paid . - Lloyd Hooks ? He Pike advice . Yes , I know the name . These are lobbyists for the oil industry . But why interferes an oil company ... Himself with Hooks who possesses a nuclear reactor ? You have the same look in the eyes as your father was . You guessed it , right ? Hooks do not want people to know because he does not repair the reactor . It is about the future of energy ... This country . They want the explosion ... Chaos and the dead , the more the better offerings . Words like a hornet 's nest . Delivered by you . You have me confused brought 'm talking about ... Tells the truth but not the real truth . I want to know what you 're doing . You know , I 'm here to help . Help with what ? The steal land or slaves . What are you planning ? The Precients are dying , like your tribe . This world has poisoned my people . Without help and a new home ... We can not live . I speak the truth , I swear . Then we can not live . Ayrs has people stoked . The bullet killed more than his appetite . He ​ ​ longs for bloodshed . I will be sure to pay . I should maybe call the police . That makes no difference . How do I know you 're not lying . Smoke will come for me when he knows I 'm with you . We need that file , no I can not protect you . You , my child , are proof that our effort was not in vain . I 'm just a waitress . I 'm not here to change the reality . In no revolution was so . Sorry , I can not do what you ask . This will be for everyone a difficult choice . But before you finally rejects I want to show you one thing . I want you to understand which we fight our battle . Cross your fingers and hope . If your prayers are times the Precients ... Then never returned to the valley ? Those who wish may go with us and are welcome . The valley is my home . Okay ? I know that it is forbidden . Sixsmith , every morning I walk the monumental stairs ... And everything is clear to me . I wish I could show this radiant light . Do not worry , everything is good . Everything is so incredibly good . I understand now that the border ... Between war and peace treaties based on . All limits are conservative . The questions to be overcome . One can overcome any border . However , one must first understand this well . At such moments I feel your heartbeat just like mine . And know that our separation is only an illusion . My life goes far across the borders . There 's a storm , Mr. Ewing , I will bring you down . I 've had enough of you . Get out . Mr. Ewing ? Wait a minute . We live in dangerous times . This is a composer Robert Schulze . You 're also a composer , yet Mr. Ewing ? - What do you want ? The sergeant wants - room search . I know how hard you work , so I said that there was no one above . It takes me a little capital a floor empty . That 's all I got . What a beautiful jacket . If the letters are not important , why you read them ? No idea . Maybe I understand something . - What then ? I wonder why we keep making the same mistakes . Maybe you should ask Megan . Do you know Megan ? - That 's his cousin , how do you know that name ? He has sent her some . Probably he used ... The envelope where he letters preserved . Luisa , the first line for a good thriller . A good clue leads to the next clue . If the life of Timothy Cavendish turns into a movie ... He ​ ​ fixed a hero as Lauwrence Olivier ... With a touch of Michael Cain . Who 's there , damn it ? Dr. Conway , House Aurora . I replace Dr. Obb . Is something wrong with mom ? Yes , Mr. Hotchkiss . I 'm afraid they do not make the upcoming night . This is very inconvenient , we really come right now ? No , but she had explicitly asked for you . In connection with her last testament . We 'll be right over . The plan is based on the domino effect . To avoid Ernie , sister Noakes , of my absence to date suggested . I know ... Success depended on the silence of Mr. Meeks . I know ... Mr. Cavendish ? Is everything okay ? Not leave me here behind . Mr. Cavendish ? I knew it was too good to be true essence . You grumpy old witch . Mr. Hotchkiss ? Your mother is my dearest friend . Please create momentum . So , now ' Adieu ' . Literally translated from French means ... 'Comment about God . " I Joe Napier on line one . He ​ ​ says that it can not wait . For God 's sake , Joe , I 'm late . What is going on ? I got a call from a journalist , Rey ? She asked Sixsmith ? - I understand . You thought she was no longer a problem ? Some problems are more urgent than others . Where is that damn key ? - He let him always in the ignition . His wife drove that stupid cow took the key with him . Dear Jesus , what do we do now ? - Look under the awning . What is this ? This is no key , what is it ? What else could it be ? - How does it work ? No . - Think of something , you 're so brilliant . We 're busted . Wow , unbelievable that I 'm going to do . Does this thing ? Can you hear me ? - Just keep walking . I think he 's following me . Whatever you do , do not look back . Get off my car . Or I 'll beat you to a pulp . - I 'll get you if you do not open it directly . Come on , get out . - Out of the car . What is this button ? No way . There is Mr. Meeks . He ​ ​ wants it . Damn what a misery . One for all , all for one ? The gate . Veronica , Mr. Meeks would you like to open the door ? Hello Mr. Meeks , we go on a night outing . I know ... Accelerate . How exciting . Watch out , the gate is closed . - They follow us , give gas . Here we go . Come on , take it . He who fights hardest ... In his darkest hour ... Is worth to see the sun rise . Mr. Ewing is currently at a critical stage of his treatment . The next few hours are critical about his life . Can I wait here ? - No , you can not . I have to . Mr. Ewing saved my life . It 's my duty . Look here , primitive monkey ... Mr. Ewing not want you here , you got him probably lit . Infected , I quote : ' gives you filthy hands off me . " Do not try again from under these conditions . Where is he going ? - I have no idea . On freedom , friends . To freedom . You 're going to regret it in so many ways that you can not even imagine . Damn . None illegals here . - I 'm not the aliens . We need your help . - No illegals , everything is fine . Are there no true Scotsmen present ? This English rig ... Hunts for years on my God-given rights . These people belong to me . Trust these people , they abused me and my friends . What we need now is a little support . That 's good , mate . We will not remember you . Oh , you hear a second ? You can send me to hell . Here are a husband and wife came by , where did they go ? Where are those two go ? Keep your mouth shut . Keep your damn mouth shut . Domme Mexican bitch . What , what are you saying ? How do I now understand if you so laments ? Let me guess , that means 'why are you doing this to me ? I thought we were friends . Now , which do you think is wrong . False , just like your father ... There is only one rule that connects all people ... A dominant rule that applies to God 's green earth . ' The weak are dominated by the strong ' . I told you not to be trusted . - You die first , asshole . You were at high risk . Enjoy your retirement . You say no more Mexican bitch to me . Why would it still be wondering ? It 's not true ... There 's gold in your truck and I want it so I got you killed . Get away from Mr. Ewing or I 'll kill you . We should flush the poison there . Come Mr. Ewing ... What was that ? - War Cries . This is what the General wanted to show me ? The end comes at me , I can neither eat or sleep . Even earthly existence slipping away from us . Would love music ever be ? They believe they glorified . But that 's not true , right ? Welcome . Go ahead . Just relax . This is to remove your collar . The Genomics industry requires large quantities of biomass ... Plus more importantly maintain of the manipulated population . Reuse is a cheap solution of a protein source . Soap . They introduce us to ourselves . This ship ... This ship must be destroyed . The regiment that had built must be abolished . We must find alternatives for the human food chain . We must all fight . And if necessary the death penalty . All have hurt the people the truth . At this moment we have been waiting for . It is finished . You became a Union governed by the satellite charged . I sent my revelation to the twelve states ... And the four alien colonies . Eighteen minutes later attacked the enforcement staff . To live hear perceived to be . Through the gaze of others , it is possible to recognize yourself . The essence of immortality ... Lies in the consequences of our words ... Deeds , that drive us ... To the end of our time . Hide . First it was a great chief , now you 're meat . Caitlin ? Thank you very much . - No , thank you . Again , that purifies the stomach . Good . Come Mr. Ewing . Look where we are ? Hold . Success . I 'm home . Megan Sixsmith ? Make them pay . There you can count on . Thanks . My uncle was a scientist , yet he believed that love overcame everything . As a kind of natural phenomenon . He ​ ​ believed that love could conquer death . Terminates my work as our last night in Cambridge ? Once more the sunrise and enjoy my last cigarette . I think it could not have been more perfect more . Until I saw that round felt hat . Seriously Sixsmith , as you wear ... I think I saw nothing better . I 've watched you for as long as I could . I do not believe it was a coincidence ... I first saw you . Agreement . - Thanks . The captain decided to take us . I would like to join . Well , but where ? They are in the same situation as we ... They have no home . No , not yet . Do you really believe your prayers are answered ? That someone from heaven ? Yes , maybe once . Some day is past hope . Yes but it does make it easier . I think ... Wait another world to us , Sixsmith . A better world and I will wait for you . Can I help you ? Yes please , I find a friend who 's here somewhere ... I do not think we are dead . Find me under the starry cosmic where we first kissed . For always , yours . RF . The file is that Commander Chang ... Died by violence . That 's right . Would you argue that you loved him ? Yes , I do . Does that mean that you still love him ? This means that I will ever do . Our lives not belong to us . Through various ways we are connected to others . From the past to the future . With each offense or good deed ... Give us our future . In your revelation speak about that every life lasts forever . Means that , that you believe in life after death ? In heaven or hell ? I believe that death is only a door . If he closes behind us , opens another . If I should imagine the sky ... I think a door that opens ... And beyond ... He is , waiting for me . I 'm home , I 'm really at home . I 've missed you so much . Thanks . I have one last question ... You must have known that the plan of the Union would fail . Why are you went along ? This is what General Apis asked me . What ? To be executed ? If I had remained in the background ... The truth would not come to light , I could not allow . How should it be if no one ' truth ' believe ? Someone believes it al Adam , God 's sake . I just tell my guests of your big adventure . Please , sit down . Grab a chair for him . No , thanks . I must go again . What are you doing here ? The doctor said you had three weeks of bed rest . He did but this can not wait . I must speak with you . Privately . - But of course . Is that the contract of Reverend Horrox ? True . I still had an errand boy blast . Are you crazy ? I have my life thanks to a slave . I can no longer ... Unscrupulous these matters exercise , sir . That was really a great book . - Let 's drink to . Thick snowflakes falling outside the crooked roofs and granite walls . As Solzhenitsyn in Vermont I will banish life . But unlike Solzhenitsyn ... I will not be alone . To the devil with you , if you are not the man of my daughter ... Hello father . What is happening here ? - I come to say goodbye . Goodbye ? Where are you going ? We go eastward to us by the abolitionists to join . What ? This poison has certainly your brain eaten . If so I can recommend it . I have never felt so good . Tilda , I forbid you to go along with this idiot . I had my whole life afraid of you , father . I go with my husband along . Listen , because of my grandson or yours . Who upset the natural order of the world will suffer for it . This movement will not survive . If you connect this , will you and the whole family disowned . You 'll live as an outsider , someone one mocked and avoids . At worst , they will pick you up at and crucify . And for what ? Whatever your involvement , it is a drop in the endless ocean . What is an ocean ? Without a quantity of droplets ? The fire goes out . Does not matter , my story is done . More , please tell you further . Can you hear your grandmother ? Come on , now . You like to sit out here , not than grandfather ? It reminds me of the valley . What is the earth ? That one , the one with the blue sheen . Come , help your grandfather up . Tell us of the ship and the adventure Nexnex ? Your grandmother can tell much better than me . Do you still grandmother ? Your grandmother , is the best thing that ever happened to me . Come here , grandfather . I will warm your old bones .

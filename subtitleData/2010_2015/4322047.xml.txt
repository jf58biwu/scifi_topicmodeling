 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... We haven 't met . I 'm Mrs. Frederic . Warehouse 13 , is it yours ? It 's mine . And so are Lattimer and Bering . Excuse me ? Kate Logan , Chicago field office . I didn 't know you had transferred to Chicago . So , uh , you showing up here means I should call you , right ? Call , don 't call . Same as always . Hey . I 'm so sorry we got cut off earlier . Something huge came up . I don 't think it 's a good idea for me to see you anymore . Turn around and put your hands in the air . H.G. Wells . It 's my daughter . My Christina . Everything that ever mattered in my life is gone now , except the Warehouse . I want to come back and work there again . I don 't care if I 'm having a brain transplant . You cross paths with H.G. Wells , yank me out of anesthesia and you fill me in . Is that understood ? Yes , sir . Crystal clear . Stop ! For God 's sake ! I told you I 've got a bad shoulder , okay ? It 's an old wrestling injury . Seventy-one . He bowled a 71 . It 's amazing to me that you 're single . Really so surprising . It broke . What ? What ? What broke ? She knows . Just some dumb shelf . I 'll kill you . Is there a reason warehouse shelves are falling down ? Yes . We need brackets . From the hardware store . I 'm usually pretty good at mysteries , this one 's got me stumped . Yeah , me too . Todd works at the hardware store . Oh , yes . Yes . Todd , the young lad with the glasses . Boyfriend . Not anymore . They broke up . She 's trying not to run into him so she won 't go to the hardware store to get the brackets ... I don 't care about Todd . She doesn 't care about Todd . What a coincidence . And we 've got work to do . Yes . Let 's all grow up a little , shall we ? Oh , snap . Kate Logan . Excuse me . Yeah . Just can 't get enough of me , can you ? Well , who can blame you ? What ? Pete , what 's wrong ? It 's Dickinson . Somebody 's ... Guys . We have to go to Washington D.C. Right now . Do they know the cause of death ? Massive internal bleeding and hypovolemic shock . This is an x-ray of Dickinson 's hand . It looks like every bone has been dislocated . Yeah , the carpals usually sit right against the radius but there 's half an inch between them . Every joint in his body looks like that , as if he was pulled apart . Oh , my God . Who the hell could have done this ? The only word for it is freaky . That 's why I called you . That 's what you do , right ? Weird and freaky . The pain , it just must have been ... Would you give us a minute ? Right . Super secret weird and freaky . Be outside . I just , I can 't believe this . Why ? I don 't care what it takes , we are not going to stop until we know who 's responsible for this . Pete , it 's me . This is my fault . Artie , what do you mean this is your fault ? How could this be your fault ? Artie , just talk to us . What did this ? You never would have thought it was anything . Just an old rusty chain . What chain ? The rack . The chain from Torquemada 's rack . What ? Who is this Torquemada woman ? A different rack entirely . Tomas de Torquemada , the Grand Inquisitor . He was the driving force behind the Spanish Inquisition . If the holder pulls the chain taut and focuses his energy on the victim , then it induces the same kind of bone-wrenching agony suffered on the rack . That 's why Dickinson 's bones were all twisted and wrenched from their sockets . I 'm sorry . I 'm so , so sorry . Artie , I just don 't understand , how is this your fault ? Well , in the ' 70s , I had some dealings with the Soviet Union . No , no , Artie , we know all that . Okay , pre-Warehouse , you worked for the NSA , you traded secrets to the Russians . They were going to charge you with treason , but Mrs. Frederic fixed it . You didn 't trade secrets , did you ? Artifacts ? Trinkets . I thought that they were antiques , old relics that the Soviets were willing to trade for . Trade ... Trade what ? Money ? No . People . Political prisoners rotting in the Gulags . You traded artifacts for people ? It was a different world , Myka . Berlin Wall , nuclear stockpiling , the persecution of Soviet Jews . What was a rusty old chain compared to a human life ? I didn 't know it was an artifact . Hey man , I 'd have done the same thing . And then one day my Russian contact let slip that these old trinkets had power . Pretty soon I discovered that many of these things had frightening dangerous power and I couldn 't live with the guilt so I ... So you turned yourself in . And that was the day Mrs. Frederic came into my life . She made me an offer , a chance to make amends for past mistakes . That 's why she gave you a new name . Arthur Weisfelt died that day and Artie Nielsen was born . That 's a hell of a story , Artie , but what 's it got to do with Dickinson ? Why him ? I don 't know , but we are going to find out . The glory are yours , forever and ever . Amen . Amen . I 'm just going to take a walk . Okay . Is she okay ? As okay as you can be at a friend 's funeral . It 's a bloody rotten business . What are you doing here ? Same as you , tracking Torquemada 's chain . It was on our Most Desired List in Warehouse 12 . Well , you know what ? You are actually on Artie 's most desired list , so unless you want to be bronzed again , I would suggest that you ... He 's still opposed to my returning as an agent ? Well , he 's opposed to your existence , so yeah , I would say that extends to you ... This is absurd . I saved your life . I saved Claudia 's life . I 've proven I can be trusted . More than that I 've proven that I 'm of value . I 'm not questioning your value . I 'm curious about your motives . Myka , I can 't ! I don 't belong in this world . The Warehouse is my ... I 'm going to need more than that . I 'm going to need more than , " She doesn 't like the world . " I need the truth . Why did they bronze you ? What , what did you do that the Regents felt that they had to encase you ? I asked to be bronzed . You asked ? You ... Who in their right mind ... I wasn 't in my right mind . My daughter , my Christina had been murdered . A senseless crime , brutal and senseless . I had to try to change it . I was working in a place where miracles happen . There had to be something , some way to bring her back or to turn back time . I spent years desperately combing the shelves of Warehouse 12 . Twice I was discovered and brought before the Regents , twice they were lenient and gave me a reprieve . The third time my recklessness cost the life of a fellow agent . I was distraught , quite mad , I 'm afraid . I had become a danger . So I asked and they said yes . I suppose I hoped to awaken in a different world , a better one . The bronzer was your time machine . Closest I could come . I 'll talk to Artie . Thank you . This is how to reach me in DC . Myka , I 'm sorry about your friend . We sure missed you when you left the NSA . Beauty and brains . Thanks , Joe . Turns out that I found my calling . Oh ! Do I want to know what that means ? No , never mind , I don 't . As long as you love what you 're doing , right ? Yeah . Right . Thanks , but I 'm really not hungry . I made tuna melts . Tuna melt ? Okay , you buried the lede . I 'm standing in front of a dead woman . You two have to live in the same town , work it out . I 'll go get some lemonade . If Claudia won 't come to the hardware store ... Hardware store will come to Claudia ? Cute . Ooh , brackets . You shouldn 't have . Yeah . So ... So ? How 's life ? Good ? If by good , you mean excruciatingly boring , then yeah , my life 's good . Yeah , mine 's really good . I 've been thinking about you . Ironic you broke up with me . I know . I guess I just didn 't think you 'd cut out of my life completely . I can do black , I can do white . Not so good with gray . You mix black paint with white paint . You 've got to get out of that hardware store , at least to find some new metaphors . So does that mean we can maybe be friends ? Friends sounds gray-ish . The thing is , Claudia ... I got to go . I 'm sorry . I 'II ... You 're leaving . I 'll call you later . I promise . I 'm really sorry ! I promise , I 'll call you ! What happened ? I have no frackin ' idea . Dude was here , got a text , dude is gone . Well , men are generally out of touch with their emotions . I mean , look at Pete and Artie . Those are my choices ? They say one thing and they do another because they 're not exactly sure how they feel . Mixed signals cover all possibilities . Exactly . How am I supposed to respond to that , Leena , with a big smile ? Or with gunfire ? With patience . Give him time . Patience . Right . No , I can be patient . Actually , no , I can 't . Sanchez , are you back from lunch already ? Could you ... Hey , who are you ? How did you get in here ? Artie , Pete 's just looking through the rest of the security camera footage . This is where you found him ? It was quick and quiet . People in the other offices didn 't hear a thing . Artie , it 's 70 degrees here , but the prelim says that he died of hypothermia . Did the chain also ... The Titanic , there was a piece of driftwood . It was pried from the arms of one of the victims . It became imbued with certain properties . Another one you traded . The coincidence doesn 't escape me either . If someone wanted Joe dead , then NSA headquarters is not the easiest place to take him out . I think whatever they were after was right here . And I want to know what . You 're never going to get in . The NSA system is so much tighter than ours ... I 'm in . I 'm surprised it took you that long . Maybe I shouldn 't be here while you hack NSA 's files . The mainframe was not accessed , so whatever they were looking for was only in this computer . Here . And the last file accessed was ... It 's just a list of Russian names and addresses . What ? Artie , what 's the connection ? Me . These are names of people that I got released from the Gulag . It 's a list of my relatives . These people are your family ? Hey guys , so I went through the internal security feed . There 's something you 're going to want to see . Okay . Wait , wait , wait , right there . H.G. Wells , what is she doing now ? And why is she coming after me ? Look , maybe she was here for other reasons . Like what ? Applying for a job ? No , like hunting down whatever artifact that did this so she can prove herself and rejoin the Warehouse . Myka , how do you know that ? I may have spoken to her . Oh , man . You 've been talking to H. G ? Let me understand this , you spoke to H.G. Wells about official Warehouse 13 matters and you didn 't tell me ? I was waiting for the right time . This ain 't it . You of all people , you accuse me of keeping secrets and then you go and do something like this ? Hey , hey , hey , no . Hey , you know what , Artie ? No , no , no , this is good . This is good because now we have a lead . We have a lead . And we know that H.G. Is involved . And all we have to do is find her and thank God that Myka is so good at that . I know where she is . The Archer Hotel . I guess we 're going . Yeah . All right . All right , Claude , you can do this . Just walk up to him and say , " Todd ... " And I 'm officially stalking him . Okay . - Her name 's Claudia . - Claudia . Yeah . Ah , took you long enough . Finally looked at the envelope , did you ? Torquemada 's chain , where is it ? I don 't have it . I 've been looking for it since 1894 . I 'm trying to help you , Artie . How do we know you didn 't kill Dickinson ? Or Joe Sweetwood ? What possible reason would I have ? Hadn 't you rather be looking for the person who was photographing Artie at Dickinson 's funeral ? Photographing me ? I followed him but by the time I got inside the NSA it was too late . He left something on Mr. Sweetwood 's body . I imagine it has significance to you . What ? What was it ? I 'm more than happy to share my information but I expect a little quid pro quo . Nothing . I tell you nothing . Right . Good luck then . Artie , wait , maybe she has some information . No , she is a killer and she belongs in the bronze sector . You don 't know that . I will not be blackmailed . It 's a lead . Artie , we need leads . All right . What is it ? In the bible on the nightstand . What does it mean ? Alexander . He 's calling me out . Who ? It 's my Soviet contact . Whenever we wanted to meet , he would leave a king of hearts . But I thought he was in prison . Yeah , well , looks like he 's out , and obviously not for good behavior . He went after Dickinson because Dickinson knew that Arthur Weisfelt had become Artie Nielsen . And by killing Joe , this guy gets the list of all your relatives in Russia . He 's going after your family . That 's all the quid pro quo you 're going to get . This guy must want you to know what he 's doing , but why ? Artie , why was Alexander sent to prison ? When I turned myself in , he became useless to his government , he was a liability . By the time I found that out , it was too late . So , revenge . I have to get to Moscow . No . Artie , that 's exactly what he wants ! He 's coming after my family . Well , we 're going , too . It 's too dangerous . Oh , don 't even bother . Weisfelt Instruments . Yeah . That 's quite the family resemblance . And teaches music just like my father . Why don 't you go in and say hello ? No . No , that would put him in even more danger . We 've never met . The family thinks that Arthur Weisfelt 's dead . It should stay that way . Man , this is a huge list . Was your whole family tree subversive ? Well , no , I had several cousins who were refuseniks . In those days , when one was grabbed , the whole family was grabbed . So how are we supposed to warn and protect everyone ... We 're not . We 're going to find Alexander first . I got it . We find the bastard and then we go in guns blazing . We 're not going to do any blazing . We 're going to keep a low profile . This visit is not exactly government-sanctioned . So no help from the local authorities and no diplomatic immunity . None . What could they do to us ? You two , they yell at you , they send you home . And what about you ? I didn 't change my name to hide from our government . As far as the Russians are concerned I 'm a spy who betrayed them , so ... See , that 's something you could have brought up on the plane . This is the safe house where Alexander and I used to meet . Alexander was a creature of habit . If he 's not here now , he will be soon . Well , finally , we 're one step ahead of this guy . He 's on the roof . Son of a bitch ! Grenade ! No . Croquet ball . Croquet ball . Oh , God , if he 's got the other one ... Get down ! Down ! Is this another old friend of yours , Artie ? Yeah . It 's Charles the Second 's croquet ball . Imbued with the fury of a king and a sore loser . Interesting sidebar ... Later ! So how do we stop it ? We don 't . It 's got to stop on its own . It could take hours . The ball is lethal , stay out of its way . I think I can make it to the door and then see if I can spot him . Artie , be careful ! Pete , get down ! Oh . Bye-bye . Myka , you think you can get to the old fridge ? You 're hungry now ? Just be prepared to open it . Okay ? Right . Okay . Ready ? One , two ... Go ! Whoa ! Pete , behind you ! Whoa ! Little league , don 't fail me now ! Pete , Artie 's outside ! Artie ! Well , this isn 't good . Are you getting a vibe ? Don 't need one . Yeah ? I 'm here . Who are the Fighting Ocelots ? Hmm ? Claude , you have a Post-it kind of stuck on your ... Hey , you find any info on Alexander ? We 've run into a real dead end here . Ah , I pulled an all-nighter digging for intel . And ? Nada . The Soviets must have disappeared him . I 'm running some needle-in-a-haystack programs right now but I 'm going to need a little more info . Can you put Artie on a sec ? Can 't , he 's ... Artie got hungry and he went out for some borscht . Just get back to us . There 's no use in panicking Claudia . I mean , there 's not much she can do from there . There 's not much we can do from here . And now I want borscht . Wow . Is that all on Alexander ? This is on Alexander . This is on Todd . I 'm not stalking him , but look at this picture I took of him . Look at that . See the guy he 's talking to ? He 's totally packing heat in Univille . I mean , I saw that , I figured maybe I should dig a little deeper . School records , tax , dental records . Claudia , that 's a little stalker-y . What did you find out ? Nothing . Until you get behind the data . All of this info was entered on the same day six months ago . Right before Todd showed up in our sleepy little hamlet . Leena , what if Todd is trying to use me to get into the Warehouse ? I think I should go to town ... No . You should stay away from him until Artie gets back . Claudia . You 're right . You 're right . That 's exactly what I was thinking . I guess I 'll just figure out which shelf to put this thing on . I 'll do that . I 'll do it . I 'll do it . Okay . Okay . Too easy . Claudi-ella , I was just thinking about you . Todd-o-rama . Settle a bet for Pete and me . He thinks there 's no high school with an ocelot mascot , but I thought you said your high school football team had one , right ? Did we talk about this ? Yeah , the Fighting Ocelots . I knew it . The undefeated Ocelots . Pride and joy of my youth . Listen , I was thinking , we should totally be friends and hang out . Nice segue . How about Friday ? How about now ? Sounds good . Pond in the park in say , 45 ? Make it 40 . Great . Okay , we can 't go to the local police and we certainly can 't go to the government . We don 't know how to call Mrs. Frederic . Well , all right , what about ... Hold it . What ? What ? What is this ? Oh , for crying out loud . I think someone 's watching us . Why didn 't you just say that ? Because I 'm trying to act nonchalant . Oh , good job . All right , so I still want you to go that way . Mmm-hmm . Okay ? And then I 'm going to go ... I 'm going to go this way . Okay . Take the bag , okay ? We 'll see who he follows . Okay . All right , babe . Well , I 'll see you later . I 'll see you at dinner . Give me some sugar . Just go with it . All right . Was that really necessary ? Hey , you . You mind telling me what you 're doing here ? Hi . You remember me ? We really don 't have time for this . How did you find us ? Receiver . It tells me the exact coordinates of the transmitter I slipped into Myka 's pocket at the cemetery . And before you get angry ... I 'm not angry . Just tell me you also slipped one of those into Artie 's pocket , too . Artie 's gone ? He was kidnapped . Probably by same person who killed Dickinson and Sweetwood . We could use your help . Wait , Myka , no . Artie would blow a gasket . Pete , we need help and she 's here . And for the record , I knew that you 'd slipped this in my pocket in the cemetery . I thought you 'd know . I knew that you 'd think that . All right . Look , we think he might have been taken by his former Soviet contact . That 's impossible . How do you know that ? It couldn 't have been Alexander . That 's why Claudia 's trail ran cold . Do you mind filling me in here ? Alexander died 13 years ago . Alexander . Alexi ? It 's you , isn 't it ? Why ? Some kind of revenge ? Alexander , listen , what we did was wrong . The artifacts were dangerous . They needed to be locked away . That 's why I turned myself in . I didn 't know that they would punish you . Save your breath . You 'll need it . Who the hell are you ? The last person you 'll ever see . Arthur Weisfelt . The man I spent my entire life hating . Oh , my God . You look just like ... It 's Ivan , right ? Ivan , you 're Alexander 's son . No . To be a son , you need a father . Mine spent his entire life in prison because of you . Not me . Your government did that . You caused it . They gave you a new life while my father died in a cell . Now , it 's your turn . Do you really think we should be going through Artie 's bag ? Yes ! Pete , unless you have a better idea ! What other option do we have ? Okay . Okay . Two Mykas . This is going to be fun . Hey , a compass . Maybe this is some sort of homing device that always points to Artie . No . No . That would be too easy . Holy crap . What does that do ? It holds Artie 's glasses . Right . So I can understand your excitement . But Artie always loses his glasses , which is why Claudia rigged them so he could always find them . Is this the receiver ? No . He lost that weeks ago . But I know someone who has one . Good job . You made it . Of course . I said I would . People say a lot of things . They do , they do . Hey , you don 't drive an old El Camino , do you ? Me ? No . It 's Artie 's , actually . I hardly ever ... Oh , screw it . What the hell is that ? I 'm asking the questions here . Starting with who the hell are you ? Me ? You don 't exist . You 're six months old . Why were you spying on me ? I figured you out , man . Think you can use me to get into the Warehouse ? What do I care about an IRS warehouse ? I bet you 're just as bad as MacPherson , you just want ... Wait , what ? Who 's MacPherson ? You think it 's an IRS warehouse ? Isn 't it ? Or , ha , is that just your cover working for John Conti ? John Conti ? Who the hell is John ... Wait , John Conti the mobster ? Dude , I don 't work for him . Then what the hell is going on ? Oh , Todd , you 're in trouble . Trying hard not to be . Was the Marshal right ? Am I a dead guy ? No , no , of course not . You 're ... Jinkies . You 're in the Witness Protection Program , aren 't you ? Man , you didn 't know that ? No . Man , how the hell did you get yourself into the program ? I was just an IT guy Conti hired to recover a hard drive . I saw some files I wasn 't supposed to and all of a sudden I 'm living in this weird town in South Dakota . I wanted to tell you but I couldn 't . And that ... That guy I saw you with was ... My handler . He 's pretty pissed at me right now . I wasn 't supposed to get close to anybody , let alone fall in love with them . Wait a second , back that up . Okay , love is a really strong word . No , no , no . Further back . You mean you really are a techie after all ? Monster . Dude . The light is flashing . He should be right here . I guess he was . This way . Oh , my God , you 've got the jacks . So killing those men , the list of my family , that was for what ? Just to get me here ? Ivan , no . Don 't . Don 't use that . It doesn 't just affect victims . Whoever uses it , it infects your soul . It steals your humanity and the longer you have it , the more like Torquemada you become . Good . That will make this easier . Okay , where now ? You guys take this corridor . I 'll go this way . Just come help me with this door . Why didn 't you just yell , " Here we come " ? Hey . Be careful . Pete ! What ? Come on . Artie . Artie ! Oh , come on ! There 's got to be another way ! What ? What ? What are you ... It 's okay . Don 't . No . Behind you ! It 's okay . You don 't need to do this . It takes a few minutes . I want to watch you watch your friend die . Let her die . Who cares ? Means nothing to me . This woman who risks her life to save yours ? I see it 's still very hazardous to be your friend . There 's no time . What are you doing ? Okay . Let 's see what this thing does . Okay and go . And activate ! Fire ! Come on ! Wait , wait , wait , wait , it 's a reflex hammer , right ? Sure . Okay , well . Now that 's cool . Let 's go . Yeah . Why ? Ivan , why ? What 's the point ? What are you going to do ? You 're just going to kill people who have absolutely nothing to do with this ? Don 't worry . Don 't worry . Her death will be quick . Not yours . Take this . Hold this tight . It 's the only thing that will reverse it . Hold it tight . You 'll be all right . You all right ? Yeah , that was a good shot , by the way . Unless you were shooting at Ivan . If I 'd shot him , you 'd still be chained there and I would have frozen to death . That was good thinking . You 're going to be all right . You 'll be all right . Well , that wasn 't so hard . Say it again . Come on . Please . For me . My preferred method of hacking is to use an integrated secure toolkit applied to a safe-type concurrent algorithm , derived from an active binary work cluster embedded in a synchronized meta-level high-speed architecture . I love it when you talk tech . He 's going to be here soon . This sucks . We can finally talk . I finally feel like I 'm getting to know you . Suckity , suckity , suck , suck , suck . Sorry . My handlers are just too freaked . Think I 'll be safer someplace else . But hey , if I live to testify , I 'll come back . Now that 's an interesting brush-off . I could always just send Conti into an inter-dimensional space . What 's that ? Tell you later . Not fair . Todd , time to go . You know I 'll find you . You better . How could you ? You turned her in ! You handed her over to the Regents without even considering that she might be a valuable asset . And ... What makes you think that this was his decision , Agent Bering ? Do you seriously believe that there 's not a thorough and complete vetting process by which the Agents of Warehouse 13 are selected ? Mrs. Frederic recommends , Regents discuss , and I make the final decision . Artie , so who 's this guy now ? Mr. Kosan , Agent Lattimer , Agent Bering . Adwin Kosan is on a need-to-know basis and you don 't need to know . You make the decisions . Some of them , yes . We have to trust that Mr. Kosan will make the right choice . The choice has been made . Has she been bronzed then ? Miss Wells . This is thanks in no small part to Agent Bering 's report . Agent Bering 's report ? I tried to tell you but I ... In conjunction with our findings , H.G. Wells is to be fully reinstated as a Warehouse agent . She 's convinced the Regents that she 's no longer a threat , but an asset . Welcome home , Agent Wells . Thank you , sir . Agent Wells . Reinstated ? Be it ever so humble . Thank you . Without you I wouldn 't be here . Well , I would but I 'd be in bronze . Welcome to the team , I guess . Yeah . Thank you . No . This is wrong . Artie . This is wrong ! Artie ! Artie ? Artie , wait ! Artie , wait ! Artie , don 't you dare just walk away . We went to Russia so we could right the wrongs from your past . Don 't you think that H.G. Deserves the same chance ? What are you saying , that she 's just like me ? You 're wrong . She 's nothing like me . And no matter how much good she 's done for all of us , I 'll never trust that woman . But if the Regents are sure , don 't you think you should be ... Oh , now you want to know what I think . I think I 'm going to regret not letting her freeze to death , but by then it 'll be too late for all of us .

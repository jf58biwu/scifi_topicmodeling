 Come on , Leo . Time to eat . Leo ! REAL HUMANS - Hello , Ove Holm . Hubot unit . - Hello . Förberg . Novak , Beatrice . An S series Techbot . Popular with the homebrewers , like , ten years ago . But what they did to it , I 'll never know . Nothing they 'd want to flaunt . This gadget hasn 't been laying here for more than a couple of days . Who buries a hacked hub , but leaves two dead bodies in the open ? - We can 't get to it . - But what if ... - Forget about it . - 400.000 volts . - 400.000 ? - You 'd turn to ash . - How long do you have ? - A day , or so . The church is that way . Long way to go . - We have to get power . - We can 't do as we did last time . The old couple saw us and told about us by now . They all know who we are . You 're wise , Fred . But you make it sound so hopeless . We just have to be careful , and do what we have to do . Or ? Do you have a better idea ? Should we just lie down and slowly discharge ? - No , I was just ... - Thinking , maybe ? This way . Excuse me . Do you know Hubot Heaven ? HUBOT HEAVEN Come on , Max . Max ? Don 't throw your clothes on the floor , you monkey . - Why can 't you just pick it up ? - I 'm not your housekeeper . - Can 't you throw it in the laundry ? - It 's not mine ! - Stop being so lazy . - Pig . - Hello . - Hello ... Sorry . The lock is busted , but there 's a latch . I don 't believe it . How do you do it ? I don 't believe it ... Take that . Very well played . You can 't say " well played " , and then show better cards . Dammit ! Bloody hell ... - Can I get you a napkin ? - What a fucking loony bin this is ... What the hell ? Roger ? Napkin . Napkin . Nap . Nap . Nap . N. N ... How are you ? Did you break ? - That thing just ran into my legs . - Okay ... It 's his word against yours and I won 't take this any further . But I want you to work on your attitude . We have a policy I want to implement . - Imple-what ? - Carry out . We don 't call our hubots " it " . If you can 't remember their names , you call them " him " or " her " . Okay ? They have names ? They will all get names from Shakespeare 's plays . My idea . Iago , Ophelia , Hamlet , Puck , Shylock , Julia . They will get name tags . - Mmm ? - Sure . What if you took this week off , rest up , to come back refreshed on monday ? Use my vacation time ? My treat . - The cutlery is still in the box . - Oh ? - The one on the top . - Okay . Should I put them in the kitchen drawer instead ? - Hi , dad . - Hey , buddy . Where are you ? Does the phone work now ? - I bought you a new one , you know . - Mom already bought me a new one . - I can 't tell you where we are . - Why not ? Where are you ? Who 's on the phone ? Kevin ? Kevin ? He called me ... I 'll get you a new number . Honey . You will see Roger again , I just need to sort everything out first . Why ? It 's complicated . Odi ? That 's the ship we built . Oh ? - Do you remember the ship ? - No . We built it together , but you don 't remember . - It has no colors . - We never got around to painting it . But if you want ... - I have paint . Do you want to paint it ? - Yes , I 'd love to . - Like the picture . - Yes . - Just promise to be quiet . - I promise to be quiet . - Have you told Anita to mow the lawn ? - She 's trimming the edges . - Brushed your teeth ? - Yes . Let 's see where we are ... - Can 't Anita read instead ? - I 'll read the story . She can 't ? Do you want Anita to read instead of me ? Okay . Then I 'll get it ... Her . She 's never in a hurry , like you are . - I 'm a little tired , honey . - You 're always tired . - Am I really ? - Often . So , do you want me or Anita to read ? Anita . Okay . Hello , Anita . Now I 'll read you a story , Sofia . Don 't you ever sleep ? No . - Don 't you get sleepy ? - No . I never get sleepy . " Once upon a time there was a man called Pettson . " " He lived in a house on the countryside , and had everything a man could want . " " Except for the times when he could feel a bit lonely . " Sit down . Rest , Max . Rest . I 'll be back soon . Welcome back . Have you seen her ? - Hubot ? - Yes . No . Number 5 . Number 5 , red . - Room 3 for 30 minutes . - 40 . - It 's either 30 or an hour . - 30 then . Have a good time . Have you seen her ? - I don 't know . - Have you seen her here ? I said , I don 't know . Maybe one of the ones we have , will do ? You like ? We sell them in the bar . - What 's wrong ? - Nothing . Have you seen her ? You okay ? Look , mommy ! Help ... Help ! Mommy . Mommy ! Leo ! Did you borrow $ 15 from my wallet . No . Must be mistaking ... This is better than sleeping pills . Falling asleep ? Stop it . What ? " Hello , Findus , Pettson said . It looked Pettson straight in the eyes ... " Anita ... You can stop reading now . She 's asleep . Seriously , Niska . Don 't you think the humans would take care of us , if we turned ourselves in ? After all , we 're not like other hubots , they would see that , and maybe even let us be one of them . We are David 's children , and David was an important man . No , Fred . Mankind isn 't a David . Or a Leo . It 's an organism who hates us , and it will destroy us . Trust me . But one day ... When we 've got the numbers , they will fear us so much , that they 'll please us . Then they will surrender . Not us . I think most of them are good . You are naive . I 'm painting . - We won 't paint the boat anymore now . - No ... I stop painting now . Why did you do that ? - We can build a new house . - It 's a boat , Odi . Yes ... We ... - Why don 't we just talk ? - Yes . Do you remember the old car ? The Renault . Yes . - Remember the trip to Skåne ? - Yes . - Remember the color of the old car ? - Yes . It was yellow and red . No ... - I 'm sorry I broke the ship . - That 's all right . Do you want lasagna ? Yes ! I 'd love to . Some other time . We had a dark blue Renault 4 , with 125 bhp and it almost did 90 mph . It broke down after 95.908 miles . We forgot the Sinatra-cd in the car when the tow truck took it away . The tow truck was yellow and red . It was yellow and red . Yes ! - Then we got the silver Volvo . - That 's right . Lennart . - I don 't like her . - Raise you arm . - Lennart ! - Raise your arm , Odi . I can do it myself . You need your sleep . What are you doing in there ? - I was raising the mast on the boat . - I don 't think you have a boat in there . A scale model . Good night . Hi there ! Sometimes I do things I 'm not supposed to do . - Like what ? - You promise not to tell anyone ? - To whom can 't I tell ? - Not to anyone . I promise . I steal things . I stole this from you . You didn 't steal the headband . You borrowed it . And now , you 're returning it . Run ! Over there ! Move it . Into the woods , and wait there . Gordon ! Well , move it . What 's up with you ? Dogs . Go . Or both you and your sister will be left to the dogs . We 've found 3 destroyed hubot 's , all carrying that mark . I 'll run a trace . They talk about autonomous , roaming groups of hubot 's that care for each other . A couple of toasters wouldn 't do worse on their own . I was thinking about the blank prints in the house . Why so many of them ? There were prints from humans too . Not on the murder weapon or on the ropes they were tied up with . I 'm not saying they weren 't involved . But they didn 't act alone . - There was a third party . - Could have been anyone , at any time . Yes , Holm . Hello . I understand . Thank you . Wonderful . - They found the man 's car . - And ? Close to the city . - And the same prints in the car . - Well , then . The human leave with the car , the dogs pick up a scent in the woods . The hubot 's must have left on their own . We 'll need to check the house again . I checked the power consumption . It peaked a couple of days ago . 25 % of that would account for a drained hubot . I 'd say there were 6 to 8 of them . But who 'd do this just to charge their hub 's ? - Nothing seems stolen . 8 of them ... - Sure . Hub 's have no emotions , no God . No thought , will or motive either . We 'd be better off with them banned and burned . - My personal opinion . - Better leave those at home . - You have one ? - None of your business . - You have a hubot ? - You 're missing something . Working at EHURB doesn 't mean you hate all hubots . Traffic cops drives cars too . Maybe you recognize that sign . REAL HUMANS Hey , you . Aren 't you in the same class as Kevin ? - Not anymore . - You switched classes ? - Wait , wait . Kevin switched classes ? - Yes . - Do you know to where ? - No idea . What , " no idea " ? Can I help you ? - I 'm looking for Inger . - She 's not at home . - Can I take a message ? - When will she be home ? About 5.30 pm . Goodbye . - I wasn 't finished . Understand ? - Excuse me ? - They leave you alone , like this ? - Yes . No shit ? Down . Up . Down . And up . Down , up . Down , up . Down , up , down , up . Retard ... - Two latte , please . - Okay . Extra milk in Inger 's latte . - Are you stressed out ? No , I have an appointment at 1 pm in city hall , but that 's cool . But how are you ? Well ... up and down , I guess . But it 's okay . Messy , but okay . Maybe harder on Kevin . But this was the only thing to do . Roger talked to you ? If he does , don 't give him my address or number . - Promise ? - Of course ! Extra milk in Inger 's latte . I mean , in one of the lattes . Inger 's latte . - Thank you . - Enjoy . - Hello . - Hello . - Rick , only say hi to people I talk to . - Okay . Can I check my email ? Thank you . - Checking the email ? - He 's mailing Bo , a hubot friend . - About ? - Experiences . They both have this new amazing software . He actually listens , and learns new things all the time . It may sound strange , but I think he understands me better than Roger did . - You can talk about feelings ? - You may not always want to do that . But I can . He listens . That 's what 's important . And when I 'm sad , he holds me . It 's not like we 're having sex or anything . - If you thought so . - No , no . But he 's good for me . I don 't care what people think . - I don 't understand what people ... - There 's a lot of opinions out there . Like my friend , Pilar . She has Bo , and we 've met a few times , and Rick and Bo have a blast together . - That 's great . - Isn 't it ? Can 't we meet , all six tonight ? You , me , and ... - Hans ? - Anita . Therese , I 'd love to meet up , but I think I will leave Anita at home . And Hans ... - Hello , is Inger here ? - Sure . Inger ! - I 'm sorry to disturb . - It 's all right . Therese hasn 't contacted you recently ? Why ? She must have changed phone plan . Could you give me her number ? - Well ... - I need to reach her . I understand , but she asked me not to give it out . - But it 's me . Her husband . - I promised her . She can 't decide for Kevin , can she ? Isn 't there laws ? You 're a lawyer ? It may be , I don 't have the facts . - I know Kevin doesn 't want this . - But Kevin is her son . I 'm the only father he 's ever had . And I have never seen him as anything , but my boy . And her ... hooked up with that robot . Some people are , you know ? Disgusting ... Makes you wanna throw up . It 's fucking sickening . Sorry . You have one of those . Sorry ... - I meant ... - It 's okay . Please ? For Kevin 's sake . I promise not to tell . I will talk to Therese . I promise . You can 't buy a Kevin . You can 't just buy a Kevin . Who wrote " The Phantom of the Opera " ? - Andrew Lloyd Webber . - Correct ! Brown question . Don 't you wanna play , Kevin ? You read it . Eh ... Who wrote the novel about Arvid Falk ? Wait ... Say it . August Strindberg . Correct . It 's called " The Red Room " . You 're so good at this . Have we stopped playing , or what ? Excuse me . Why didn 't you bring your hubot ? - Our hubot . - You think it 's embarrassing . - No , I think ... - Yes , you do . Say it like it is . Let Inger speak . I don 't think it 's embarrassing . But Anita is our maid and nanny , not our companion . Not that there 's anything wrong with that . I don 't know why you bought Bo . We met ... At Hubmarket . - You don 't want the ice cream ? - No , thanks . I think it would help if Kevin and Rick got some alone time . Kevin . - What 's wrong , honey ? - Nothing . - Help me clean up in the kitchen ? - Me ? Then , what 's Rick for ? If maybe ... you and Rick were to do something , together ? Just the two of you . - I just thought ... - No , keep on not thinking . Those that say our love is any less , or sick ... They don 't know what love is . They have never loved . Bo is the finest , most loving man I have ever met . We dream about having kids . - There . - Thank you , Rick . Do you want to talk ? - Go to Bo . - Okay . Roger asked me for your number . - He wants to see Kevin . - Kevin 's not his child . - Has he ever hurt Kevin ? - No , not Kevin ... Therese . Roger is like a dad to him . And he will get to see him , when I think it 's time . Kevin 's fine with that . - I 'm having a lot to deal with . - Sure . I 'm sorry . It 's not so easy , you know . Are you sleeping ? Hey ... - I love you . - Me too . You never ... I know this sounds silly ... Have you ever felt any attraction to her ? To Anita . I 'm sorry . I heard how that sounded . Have you ? Leo ! Leo ! Leo ! - You were gone . Max got scared . - You know Leo won 't leave Max . You must never leave like that . I will always be back . Okay ? Check it . There . - Did you find Mimi ? - No . We 'll check Hubot Heaven again . My God . Look at your new clothes . The teacher don 't tell you to wear rain gear ? - I didn 't have any . - Yes , you do . Anita brought it . - I don 't know . - Go up and change . - I told you to bring the rain gear . - No . I did . Come with me . Look . This is what they look like . They 're clean , which means they haven 't been at the youth club . - I didn 't know to bring them . - I told you . - Maybe I didn 't hear it . - I was loud and clear . - We need to talk . - Just wait a minute . - You will bring them ... - No . We need to talk now . What is it ? Is there anyone here who have borrowed some money from me ? Well , it 's not me . Why are you looking at me ? I haven 't taken any money . Yesterday it was $ 15 and today another $ 70 . It 's adding up . No one ? Guys . Someone has taken them , and and that someone must really need the money , and that 's troubling . Or if it 's kleptomania . That 's an illness you need treatment for . What kind of illness is that ? When you can 't help yourself from stealing . - Tobbe ? - I 'm no ... kleptomaniac . Anita ? - Do you know anything about this ? - Yes , I know where the money is . How strange . - I 'm rolling in it , again . - That 's my necklace . - Whose are these ? - Eh ... Nicke forgot them . And here 's my hair ribbon . Which you wore . This is not okay . And then you hide it in Sofias room . Didn 't you realize she gets the blame ? - At least , admit and say your sorry ! - Inger . Oh , sorry . I forgot that you 're a fucking machine . Which will be returned . - I didn 't take those things . - Don 't you lie ! - It was me . - This is sick . Sofia . You must never take the blame for what someone else has done . And Anita is a machine . A thing . A doll that doesn 't work . - But it was me ! - Guys , guys . - How did you know it was there ? - The one that put it there , showed me . And who was that ? Who was it ? - You can say that it was me . - Quiet , Sofia . Who showed you ? Sofia showed me . My headband was there . I don 't know who put the borrowed things there . It was me . And it is like she says . I only borrowed the things . And you never told Anita to bring the rain gear . You told me . And I forgot . God , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Creepy . Do you see ... his eyes ? They should have curtains in here . They look right into me . If you speak louder , you 'll hear the echo in here . Over here . - Do we know the power rating ? - We 'll find out .

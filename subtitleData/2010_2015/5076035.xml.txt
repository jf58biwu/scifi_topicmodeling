 NARRATOR : Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Someone shot her . Artie killed Leena . We 've all been whammied at some point , right ? I cast you out . Claudia , no ! You separated the evil from Artie . You knew the world needed saving , even if it cost you the only father you 've ever known . ( GASPS ) Holy metaphor . Artie 's brain is ... The Warehouse . What 's wrong ? It 's reality fighting its way in . It 's the fight that matters , Artie . Now , go ! No ! Yes ! PETE : I have something to say . Ever since I started working here , what I thought I knew about the world ... ( SCOFFS ) It changes pretty much every day . Artie did what he did with the Astrolabe to save Warehouse 13 . ( STAMMERING ) To save all of us . As far as we know , to save the whole damn world . Sometimes artifacts , they can do terrible , unspeakable things to people . I mean , heck , one time an artifact made me think I slept with Myka . ( WHISPERING ) Pete ! Exactly . What happened after the Astrolabe , Brother Adrian , the stolen artifacts , the Orchid , Leena . That wasn 't Artie . What I know about the world is it changes every day . There 's one thing that doesn 't change . Warehouse 13 does not work without this man . We need him . You need him . Thank you , Agent Lattimer . But we 'd already come to the same conclusion . ( LAUGHING ) What ? Oh ! Well , then , there you go . You 've what ? No , Artie , shh , no , I 'm resting my case . We see no need for punishment at this juncture . You can 't be serious . Leena was a valued member of the team . And a friend . But she knew the risks and accepted them . This is her video signature statement . We thought seeing it might give you some closure . Her death was a tragic , yet unavoidable casualty in our ongoing mission . We 're reinstating you as soon as possible . I killed her ! Did you ? Did Arthur Nielsen kill Leena ? Would you have willingly taken her life , any life , if not under the thrall of the Astrolabe ? No . But it doesn 't change the fact . She died by my hand . And you will have to live that . I feel that sentence is far more severe than any this tribunal could mete out . MALE VOICE : ( ECHOING ) And the evil that will live with you the rest of your days . We 're adjourned . Claud , what is it ? They didn 't say anything about it . About what ? I cast you out ! Nothing . Never mind . Artie , maybe we should talk about what happened back there . No , we probably shouldn 't . Maybe we should just give him his space . No ! No , Pete , his space is really , really dark right now . Did you hear him ? He wanted to be punished . He is not okay , Pete . Maybe he 'll never be okay . I mean , we just got him back , and now he 's farther away than ever . And where is Claudia ? She went back to the BB . I don 't know , maybe she 's avoiding the Warehouse , or Artie or both . I do not like what 's happening . Yeah , well , like you 've been saying , Mykes , we just need to keep moving . Okay ? And I 'm sure some scary artifact thing will come up before we can say " ping . " ( PANTING ) Pick up ! Pick up ! This line is deadly . Somebody knows ! We gotta get out ! We gotta ... Oh , God ! ( GRUNTING ) Wait ! You don 't understand . Please . What are you ... What are you doing ? What are you doing ? What ... Oh , my God ! No ! Oh , my God ! Please , don 't ! Help me ! No ! MAN : My , God ! No , please ! Please , stop ! ( SCREAMING ) Help me ! Oh , my God ! Help me ! Help ! Oh , God ! Yeah , this is about the deadest guy I 've ever seen . Did you talk to the people who found the body ? Yeah , yeah , a couple of day-hikers said they heard a scream , felt a tremor , and then something about a blue glow . A man gets sucked into the ground . Well , it sounds like an artifact to me . Yeah , maybe something quicksand-related . Promises to be loads of fun , though . How 's Claudia ? She 's up looking for clues . Not really the outdoorsy type . I think it was a good for her to come with me . It 'll keep her mind off Artie . How 's he doing ? Well , he 's been in the stacks all morning . Steve and I are gonna go look for him in a bit . Whoa . An ATV ! Oh , man , I love ATVs ! Hey ... Hey , Mykes , you think the Warehouse could get a decked out ... No . Hello ? Hi , there . Hey . Special Agent Pete Lattimer , Secret Service . ( GASPS ) No ! Secret Service ? Yeah . That is very cool . I 'm Ranger Evan Smith . Ranger Smith ? ( LAUGHING ) ( IMITATING YOGI BEAR ) Hey , Mister Ranger , sir ! ( EXHALES ) I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , but you probably get that all the time . ( IMITATING YOGI BEAR ) Hey , Boo Boo . Nope , can 't say that I do . No . What ! No , the ... The cartoon . Listen , uh , people are freakin ' out about this . Seismic activity doesn 't usually limit itself to a few square yards . You know what I mean ? Mmm-hmm . EVAN : How does something like this even happen ? Well , you 'd be surprised at the kind of things that can happen . " Go with Pete , " they said , " You 'll love it . Sunshine , fresh air ... " Ow ! Why am I so delicious to you ? ( SIGHS ) ( CRUNCHES ) Sat on too many laptops not to know that sound . Hey ! What 'd you find ? I think ... Yep , buried cell phone . Coincidence ? Hardly ever . Can you hack it ? I think ... Oh . Might take me a little bit . Well , Bentley could have dropped it on his way down . Who ? Linus Bentley , our victim . He 's the president of Qualcast Communications . I got his wallet and his cards , but ... No artifact on him . Which might mean somebody else did the whammying . Let 's find out who would want this guy dead , huh ? All right , scanning for info now . Ugh , my connection sucks out here . You know we 're in the middle of a forest , right ? Ow ! Stop that ! Well aware . ( MOSQUITO BUZZES ) I 'll kill your whole family . ( COMPUTER BEEPS ) Okay , Linus Bentley , telecomm guru . His name 's all over the Oregon blogosphere . Apparently , a substation Qualcast is building has drawn the wrath of Green First , a local non-profit . Claiming that the signals are disturbing a local owl sanctuary , probably killing bees . Oh , they 've been trying to get construction shut down . Well , Bentley 's a good place to start if Green First wanted this project buried . MAN 1 : You guys ready ? All right . Up ! MAN 2 : Yep . Let 's go . Bad choice of words . It 's just that he 's in a really scary place right now , and I just ... I hate to think about him wandering by himself down here in crazy town . You don 't think that he would do anything ? I ... I don 't ... Oh , my God ! Artie , don 't ! ( ENERGY CRACKLES ) Ow ! Ah ! What is wrong with you ? Us ? You ! With the ... The blade ! " No " what ? No ? I was redistributing its energy weight . It has to be done every 90 days . What are you doing here , anyway ? I thought you were on a ping with Pete in Oregon . I sent Claudia with Pete . You sent ? Since when do you ... Uh-huh . You know what , it 's fine . It 's fine with me . Whatever . No , Artie , yell at me , please . I said it was fine . Myka . No , I should have consulted you , I should have ... Stop . ( MYKA SIGHS ) What 's this ? That 's nothing . Give it ... Give ... Give that to me . What is this ? Leena 's list ? ( SIGHS ) Yes , it 's , uh , things that ... She did to keep certain artifacts in balance . Somebody ... Somebody has to keep doing it . Anyway , it doesn 't matter . Just leave it . Leave me alone . Artie , let us help you . Yeah . Help me ? I 've been doing this job alone for 35 years , thank you very much . You know what ? Fine , Artie . You just go do everything by yourself , and we 'll just follow you around and watch you . Fine . Good luck with that ! Clean up that mess you made ! ( SIGHS ) PETE : So , this is an environmental non-profit , huh ? Yeah , what 'd you expect ? I don 't know , hippies in tie-dye singing Age of Aquarius . You know Vietnam 's over , right ? For those of us who 've watched the director 's cut of Platoon , it 'll never be over . WOMAN : Okay , great . Start with the block of Spalding , near the community gardens . We only need another 65 signatures . Hello . CLAUDIA : Hi . You look like you might be in charge . Hi . Yes . Welcome to Green First . I 'm Autumn Radner . Thank you for coming . It 's great to see people coming out to help with their dads . Ah , that 's what it feels like to be shot . We just moved into this storefront , so it 's a little hectic around here , but I know they could really use some help in the phone bank . Uh , no , me and my non-related work partner , colleague , who 's really not young enough to be my daughter person and I have some questions about Linus Bentley . Seriously ? He 's using the government to intimidate us now ? That is pretty desperate . You can tell him we 're not backing down . We 're not here about the birds . Owls . Owls are birds . It 's not just about the owls . It 's about greed . We do not ride the railroad , it rides upon us . Ding ! Who is Henry David Thoreau ? Six years of college . If we don 't stop them here , it 's only a matter of time before we lose the forest completely . Look , you can tell him ... Look , FernGully , we understand that you 're pissed , okay , but Bentley didn 't send us . Actually , he 's dead . Linus is ... He 's ... He 's dead ? Oh , my God . He was killed in the Cowan National Forest , ironically . Excuse me , I have to make a call , um ... Becky will answer any of your questions . So Bentley was in the woods yesterday because he was scouting locations for cell towers . Well , that makes sense , but she doesn 't . I mean , first thing he 's the devil . Next thing you know , she 's crying over his death . I don 't know if that 's suspicious or just another facet of women I 'll never understand . Is there anything about women you understand ? Boobie region . ( PHONE CHIMES ) Oh ! Bingo . I cloned his SIM card . It was damaged , but I managed to get a few numbers . Couple of calls to the office . Anything good ? And the last one to a different number yesterday afternoon . A place called Fine Young Cannabis , Organic Healing . PETE : It 's just that Bentley didn 't seem like the kind of guy that 'd be into medical marijuana . ( SIGHS ) This place smells like my guitar teacher . Jeff Nevins ? Mr. Nevins ? Hello ? Is anybody here ? We 're not cops . You know , just about every cop who comes in here probably says that . Good point . Okay , we 're the cops . Claud . ( BEEPS ) Pick up , Jeff ! Pick up . It 's Linus Bentley . Somebody knows ! We gotta get out ! We gotta ... Oh , God ! ( ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS ) Blue glow . Wanna take a wild guess why he never got that message ? Holy ganja , Batman ! CLAUDIA : Ah , well , the blue glow is from the grow lights . Uh , Pete ? Yeah . Look at this . Isn 't that the same symbol that was carved into the tree in the woods ? Yes , it is . Looks like Jeff Nevins is taking a dirt nap . CLAUDIA : Hey , I got the Warehouse system looking for anything that moves dirt . So far , no luck . This symbol , I 've seen it before . Yeah , back in the woods , but ... Somewhere else . May I ? ( MOUTHING DRUM BEAT ) What are you doing ? Tippy-tappy is my thing . Uh , Secret Service database , so ... Oh . ( COMPUTER BEEPS ) I forgot my password . May I ? ( TYPING ) ( BEEPS ) Really ? " Pete rules 23 " ? Oh , right ! Yeah , I remembered thinking it was weird when " Pete rules " one through 22 were taken . ( LAUGHS ) And , bazinga ! PETE : See ? I know things . Wow . Okay . Details ? About ten years ago , there was a psycho group of tree-huggers from the northwest . The called themselves the Last People on Earth . This calls them eco-terrorists . That 's the psycho part . Anything with " terror " in it comes up on our radar . These guys did some pretty gnarly vandalism at some logging sites in Oregon . Wow , these guys were hardcore . Used the Cowan Forest as their cover , hit dozens of construction sites over two years . The Lorax meets Red Dawn . Says here they dropped off the map ten years ago , so why are they back now ? I don 't know , maybe they got their green thumbs on an artifact . Instead ofjust burning down equipment , now they 're ... They 're going right to the source . They 're killing anyone they think is harming the environment . Linus Bentley was going to tear up the forest for cell phone towers . All right , well , how do we find these Last People on Earth ? Okay , most of the members stayed anonymous . Only one they caught was Ryan Clayton , and he died in prison a year ago . Maybe they 're back at their old digs ? The FBI traced them to an abandoned cabin in Cowan Forest . Oh , and I know just the ... ( IMITATES YOGI BEAR ) Mr. Ranger , sir , to lead Yogi and Boo Boo directly to a picnic central ... ( MURMURING INDISTINCTLY ) I 've never been in here before . Oh ... Artie , what is this ? It 's where she ... It 's where Leena worked . ( EXHALES ) It 's very peaceful . Yes . It is . What is this circle ? It 's a feng shui spiral that originated in Warehouse 6 . It reads our more difficult artifacts , determines the overpowering emotion behind their creation . So we can shelve them properly . Yes , it 's how Leena interpreted an artifact 's energy . Where 's the porthole from ? Oh , that 's ... That 's from the airship Norge . Right ? It was the first dirigible to cross the North Pole . Pete and I snagged that , what , Artie , two years ago ? Yes , it 's been in the Ovoid Quarantine ever since . It 's time we gave it a home . ( EXHALES ) ( ENERGY CHARGING ) Huh . I think you should buy a vowel . I would imagine ... It means " great sorrow . " Thank you . Um ... All right , aisle Toledo , 81 K. Satisfied I 'm not going to beat myself to death with this porthole ? Fine . Good-bye now . I don 't think our presence is having the desired effect . PETE : So , this is the place ? It 's nothing but a burned out shack now . PETE : What happened ? Forest fire ? Well , the story I heard was that the FBI got a lead on one of those Last Earth guys , they chased them up here , and he set fire to the place before he got arrested . Uh , listen , if you guys can find your own way back ... I gotta go deal with a drum circle in the picnic meadow . Ooh , well , I got some tear gas in the car if you wanna ... ( IMITATES THROWING TEAR GAS ) ( IMITATES CRYING ) I 'm joking ' cause it 's just a drum circle , so ... So , why would Ryan Clayton burn down his own group 's base ? Uh , force of habit ? His favorite thing is burning things down . Oh , wow . That 's beautiful . Yeah , should have focused more on the art and less on the arson . Now , if the LPE are back in action , I don 't think they 're working from here . Hey , Claud , check this out . CLAUDIA : " In wildness is the preservation of the world . " Yeah , it 's the lyrics to an awesome Metallica song , but it 's also a Henry David Thoreau quote . Now , who do we know that 's protesting Bentley , that 's against medical marijuana farming and likes to quote HDT ? You think Autumn is one of the Last People on Earth ? Well , collecting petitions is nice , but nothing says stop raping the forest like an artifact . ( CAR BRAKES SCREECH ) If she pulls out the artifact , stay away from dirt . That 's my everyday philosophy . ( DOOR SQUEAKING ) Looks like she was making a break for it . Think she got out the window ? Yeah , yeah , she , uh ... She 's probably long gone by now , we 'll never catch her . We might as well go back to the hotel . Get away from me ! Ah ! ( GRUNTING ) ( GROANING ) Pepper 's so good in burritos , so bad in the eyes . Pete , watch it . Oh , thanks . Where 's the artifact ? The what ? Whatever you used to bury Bentley and Nevins . You think I killed them ? Well , the whole packing and fleeing thing is kind of a dead giveaway . We know you were a part of the Last People on Earth , and now you 're picking off Mother Nature 's enemies . No , they were my friends . What , your friends ? Yes , I was a member , but so was Linus , so was Jeff . What , they were all LPE ? Yes , we all were . And now someone knows who we are , what we did . And they 're killing us one by one . I probably shouldn 't have held onto this , but I just couldn 't help myself . Oh , is that you ? AUTUMN : And , uh , there 's Linus and Jeff . What about these two ? That 's Annie , she died of cancer two years back . And that 's Ryan . Oh , yeah , the guy who took the rap and died in prison . The FBI ID 'd him , hunted him up to the cabin . He burned it down to keep them from finding any evidence linking the rest of us to the LPE . So , how 'd the group get started ? We met in college , found out we all had the same concerns and interests ... Like , vandalism , pyromania ... Like protecting the Cowan Forest from Lockhart Logging . They were tearing it apart , and we had to stop them before there was nothing left . By blowing up their equipment ? We were young , and idealistic ... ( SIGHS ) And stupid . It wasn 't like that at the start , but things started getting crazy , we were hitting bigger targets , causing more damage , and then , someone got hurt . It scared us . So you all just walked away . Are you gonna arrest me ? It 's not really our thing . Lockhart Logging . I mean , if anyone wanted you guys dead after all this time ... Haddon Lockhart runs the company . He ... He really , really didn 't like us . To be fair , you blew up a lot of his stuff . Worse . We never wanted to hurt anyone , and we thought the logging site was empty for the night , but Lockhart was there , he was the one who was hurt in the explosion . So , if anyone has a reason to want you dead ... Where is Lockhart these days ? Still running the company . Okay , look , I 'm gonna go talk to him . Claud , stay with Autumn , okay ? Make sure he doesn 't get to her . You got it . ( WHIRRING ) ( ZAPPING ) ( SIGHING ) Artie , so ... You 're not gonna watch it ? Won 't change anything . Won 't bring her back . You know , I remember when I made my signature statement . Saying it out loud , talking about the risks and the dangers . It was so scary . But , it ... It kind of makes you realize how important this is , you know ? She didn 't understand . She did not agree to this . Yes , she did . We all did . You should watch it . ( COMPUTER BEEPS ) ( STAMMERING ) Wait , isn 't that where ... That is where we shelved the Norge portal . This is bad . We have to go . LOCKHART : Secret Service ? What 's this about ? You remember a group called The Last People On Earth ? ( SIGHING ) You 're damn right I do . Those crazy bunch of maniacs . Nearly killed me . They fire-bombed my construction yard . Maybe they didn 't know you were there . They 're a bunch of psychos . If I ever find out who the rest of them were ... You 'd what ? Bury ' em alive ? That 'd be too good for them . It took years , years , to get that camp up and running again . Hundreds of lost jobs . Millions in lost revenue . I thought they 'd all be in jail by now . How did the FBI get a lead on Ryan Clayton ? Ah , it was an anonymous tip , and he refused to identify his cohorts . You see this ? This was the happiest day of my life . The day I stood up and testified against that terrorist . All of his family were there , all of them in shock . But you know what ? You raise a monster , that 's what happens . Oh my God ... ( GASPS ) I haven 't seen this in a long time . 2002 , Sasquatch festival . I drove all night for that . Ryan didn 't want to go but I dragged him for back-up while I stalked Adam Duritz . No , you did not . Yes , I did . ( LAUGHING ) Oh , my God . Why would you do that ? Because I had a real thing for dreadlocks . ( LAUGHING ) Ew ! I know , they were terrible ones , too . It wasn 't pretty . So , uh ... Do you ever have any regrets about the whole , " you were by definition a terrorist " thing ? We made some bad decisions , really bad ones , but we did good things , too . The LPE was the first time I felt like something I was doing mattered . I never gave much thought to tomorrow . ( SIGHING ) I , uh ... Man , I think about tomorrow all the time right now . Why is that ? Uh , well , couple of weeks ago , I got into a fight , um , with someone at work . My boss . And I had to do something that I thought could help him , but also could possibly kill him . That last part doesn 't sound like a metaphor . Long story . Didn 't actually kill him , by the way . I just ... ( SIGHING ) Now I don 't know what to do about it with him . Oh , Claudia , when I was your age , I was a mess . Maybe everyone 's a mess in their twenties , and you don 't get any do-overs , you just get older and figure things out as you go . ( GLASS SHATTERING ) ( SHUSHING ) ( GUN CHARGING ) ( CELL PHONE VIBRATING ) Stop right there . Hello , Autumn . Evan ? That 's Ranger Smith . ( STAMMERING ) But , no , that 's Evan . Ryan 's brother ... Well , I had to change my name . It 's pretty tough to get a government job when you 're related to a convicted terrorist . That 's what 's doing it . That ... Dude , that lantern ... You wanna see what it does ? No , no . I 'm good . ( WHIRRING ) ( BOTH SCREAMING ) ( GROANING ) ( SCREAMS ) Claudia ! AUTUMN : ( SCREAMS ) Don 't ! Evan ! You killed the others ? One of you betrayed Ryan , turned him into Lockhart and his goons . You don 't know what happened with Ryan . Stop , just stop . You 're the worst of the bunch . I was just a kid when you sent my brother to prison . Now I 'm gonna get justice for him . Freeze ! ( WHIMPERING ) Oh , great . Yogi 's here . Drop that lantern . You drop first . ( LANTERN WHIRRING ) Whoa ! Sleep tight . Get in . Ohhh ! ( MUFFLED SHOUTING ) ( PANTING ) No , no ! No , no , no , no ! Damn it ! ( MUFFLED SHOUTING ) ( GROANING ) Oh , my God . Pete ! Oh my God . Pete ! Argh ! ( GROANING ) Oh ... ( PANTING ) Oh , boy ... ( COUGHING ) Are you okay ? I got dirt in places ... ( SPITTING ) Where dirt should never be , but ... Otherwise , yeah , I 'm fine . Listen , Evan Smith is actually ... Evan Clayton . I saw the picture in Lockhart 's office . And he 's no Ranger Smith , and he lied , he knows who Yogi Bear is . He 's a liar ! He took Autumn . I don 't know where he went . He kept her alive for a reason . We gotta find out why . Come on , Claud . Let 's go . ( ARTIFACTS WHIRRING ) Jesus , what is happening ? Well , I was in Ovoid when I heard the alarm . The artifacts must have done this by themselves . All right . What the hell is that ? It 's a goonade . Claudia made it . She has to put her name on everything . Well , should we take cover , or ... You can just throw it and we 'll see what happens . ( WHIRRING ) ( PANTING ) ( COUGHING ) ARTIE : Uh ... Started here at the Norge porthole . Artie , this crate has busted open from the inside . It says " da Vinci 's Gargoyle . " I don 't like the sound of that . Uh ... ( SCREECHING ) Actually , that sound ? That 's the one I don 't like . ARTIE : Everybody get down ! ( SCREECHING ) ( GRUNTING ) Damn it . He took Autumn someplace else . So , how did he figure out who the other members were if Ryan never talked ? Claud , I think this might be Ryan 's old journal . Listen to this . Successful strike with September and Purple Haze today . Lockhart out of commission soon . Code names . In case the journal was discovered , he wanted to protect their identities . Obviously Jeff Nevins is Purple Haze and September is the first month in Autumn . So Evan must have found that journal after his brother did and figured out who the other members were that way . He must think they sold his brother out . How much damage can he do with that thing ? I don 't know , but I bet I know where . Does Lockhart 's main logging camp seem like a sure bet ? If he 's going after the people who wronged his brother . Lockhart 's at the top of that list , and I doubt Evan cares how many people he takes out with him . CLAUDIA : Should be just a few more miles down ... PETE : Whoa ! ( CLAUDIA SIGHING ) Whatever Evan 's planning , he want privacy . We 'll never make it in time on foot . Do you think your Prius can jump the chasm ? Probably not . But while we 're airborne , we can check Bing to see how deep the hole is as we plummet to our deaths . Or maybe we go off-road . PETE : Yee-haw ! CLAUDIA : There are no men , only boys . You all right ? I was just attacked by a stone gargoyle . It 's probably gonna be one of my new favorite scars . Artie , is that thing alive ? No , no , no . It 's a machine . It 's one of da Vinci 's lost inventions . At the end of his life , the Italian government commissioned him to build a device to protect the treasures of the Milan . ( GARGOYLE SCREECHING ) Let me guess , it worked too well and kept everyone away . But it says here the agents from Warehouse 8 got lucky . It was struck with a bolt of lightning , shutting it down long enough to snag and bag . Got lucky ? Yeah . Look , uh , I left my Tesla back at the office , but I could ... Tesla ? No , no , no . One bolt isn 't gonna be strong enough . But ... A-ha ! That means he has an idea . I 'm not gonna evacuate my camp because of some eco-freak . Look , this guy is dangerous . He shut down the road to the camp , he 's probably already here . Then my men and I will handle it our way . I 'm not gonna hand over this entire operation on a silver platter . ( SCOFFS ) No sign of him . Do we think the lantern 's strong enough to sink the whole camp ? ( GASPING QUIETLY ) I recognize that look . Vibe ? Claud , that cliff . I 'll bet he 's up there . A landslide from there could bury the whole camp . ( EXPLOSION ) ( WORKERS SHOUTING ) God , I hate when I 'm right . You 're going to kill all those people . Where was your compassion for Ryan ? Huh ? He never gave you up , not once . Not to me , not to the police , no one . You could have kept him out of prison , you know that ? He died in a cage for your cause while the rest of you got to live your lives . Evan , you can still stop this . You know , Autumn . I read his journal . He loved you . And I loved him . You 're a liar . That 's why I saved you for last . I wanted you to watch the others die . After I take this place out , they 'll find you , and you 'll die a terrorist , for all those things you did before . The same fate that you left for my brother . ( ZAPPING ) Ha ! Who 's smarter than the average bear now ? Autumn , grab the lantern ! Hey , Claudia ! Claudia , no ! Claudia ! That 's not good . Steve , you ready ? I hate this plan . Why do I have to be the bait ? It already likes you . As in it 's tasted my blood and wants more . It 's another way of putting it . ( GARGOYLE SNARLING ) ( SCREECHING ) ( WHISPERING ) I think it sees me . ARTIE : Well then , go ! Run ! ( SCREECHING ) Yeah , sort of my only option . ( SCREECHING ) ( SCREAMING ) You only get one shot at this ! Yeah , that relaxes me . ( SCREAMING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( METAL CLANGING ) ( ZAPPING ) Great . ( EXHALES ) Oh , my God . ( COUGHING ) Are you okay ? Yeah , yeah . STEVE : Nice shot , Myka , but I still don 't understand what caused all this . It must be the porthole . ( STAMMERING ) Right ? We must have shelved it in the wrong place . No , no , the spiral was very clear . Well , maybe there 's something wrong with the spiral . ( WHIRRING ) What are you doing ? Here 's the plan ... You 're gonna lower me down with the belt and I 'm gonna grab the lantern . Pete , no ! Claudia ! I 'm lighter ! Damn it , I hate when you 're right . ( EXPLOSION ) Me , too . PETE : Careful . Argh ! Don 't twist the belt ! It 's Prada I 'll make that my priority . Careful . Get it . ( GRUNTING ) You got it ! Yeah ! PETE : Bringing you up . ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( GRUNTING ) Good job . ( ZAPPING ) Argh ! STEVE : How many times can we try this ? That 's a different symbol again . It means misplaced anger . Five readings , five different results . There 's something wrong with the spiral . Artie , this doesn 't make any sense . The airship Norge was the first to cross the North Pole . Anger , sorrow ... Those emotions have no connection to that at all . I 'm gonna put this back in the Ovoid . Let it be a problem for Warehouse 14 . Artie ... ( ARTIE CLEARING THROAT ) What if it isn 't the spiral that 's not working ? What if it 's ... You know ... Perhaps , the person who 's using the spiral ? Maybe . I mean , look at this place . It 's so serene . Uh , maybe ... Maybe the spiral worked for Leena because she was so calm and centered . That makes sense . It 's the only way it could get an accurate reading . But the spiral read me . Anger , sorrow ... Fear ... ( SIGHING ) How the hell am I supposed to do this ? With us . ( SIGHING ) Artie , you don 't have to do this by yourself . We can figure all of this out , everything on Leena 's list , we 'II ... We 'll do it together , all of us . You know , Buddha says peace comes from within . Just might take a few lifetimes . Very comforting . Here , you might be a lifetime or two ahead of me . I 'll save you a seat in nirvana . ( ARTIE SIGHING ) ( WHIRRING ) It says " indescribable beauty . " Well , that 's more like it . Watch your head . Evan was right , you know ? About Ryan . Someone did call that tip to the FBI ten years ago . It was you . Why ? Ryan ... He changed . He had gotten so angry . Violent . He wanted to do something like this . Not just hit a place , but the people working in it . Said it was the only way we would get their attention . I couldn 't live with that , so I did the only thing I could think of . I turned him in . I loved him , and I stuck a knife in him . You didn 't have a choice . You had to stop him . You had to save him . You asked me if I had any regrets about the LPE . I should have been there for Ryan after he got arrested . He made it clear we should all stay away . I was young and scared , so I did what he asked . But he needed me . He needed all of us . ( SIGHING ) Oh , hi . Um ... Heard you got the snag in Oregon . That 's , uh , good . Nice job . Uh , if you 're looking for Steve or Myka , uh , they 're cleaning up in aisle ... I did what I had to do . I know you did . That 's it . Not quite . Thank you . That 's it . ( SIGHING ) MAN : As a warehouse consultant , can you state that under no duress , you accept and understand your responsibilities ? Yes , I can , and I do . MAN : And do you understand the potential risks involved ? ( SIGHING ) LEENA : Yes . The world is a dangerous place , and I know the work that the Warehouse does , and I just want to be a part of that . Yes , I know that at any given time , my life might be at risk , but ... That 's a risk that I 'm willing to take to make this world a safer place . A better place . ( SOFTLY ) I 'm sorry , Leena . ( SOBBING ) I 'm so sorry .

 Previously on Fringe ... When objects from the other Universe Cross to our side , they have an energy . A woman described it as a glimmer . How can I see it ? The cortexiphan trials . I was part of the trials when I was a kid . It was a highly experimental drug . It might enhance certain abilities In predisposed children . I 've never met anyone Who can do the things that you do . I 'll go get my coat . Please don 't tell him . You sure you don 't want some soup ? Tea or coffee ? To warm you up ? No , thank you . I have trouble keeping anything down . Your office told me how busy you are . I really appreciate you coming . I 'm sorry . I keep trying to remember you . I understand . It was a long time ago . We were just kids . So is that when you think you were exposed to something ? I 've seen about a half dozen doctors , Specialists . They think it 's the only explanation that makes sense . Well , maybe I can help you . Look , I 'm grateful you 're doing this , But that 's not why I asked to see you . I wasn 't looking to make money . Of course . I understand . But if someone 's responsible for your illness , My firm can absolutely help - The last doctor I saw , He suggested that if I could find Some of the other kids We went to school with ... Uh-huh . If some of them have the same symptoms , It might help him identify What it is that 's making me sick . I 'm sorry . I - I really don 't remember names . Uh , it 's so long ago . You know what ? I do remember one boy . Um , lloyd , um , lloyd becker . He made me eat a bug on the playground . I remember him . Lloyd becker ? Mm-hmm . Sounds like a budding sociopath . Yeah , right ? I really appreciate you helping me out . Neil wilson . N - e-I-I . Oh , and could you make an appointment With that oncologist Over at rhode island general ? You know , the one who always calls me " honey . " was it gorski ? Gorlami ... Dr. Gorlitsky ? Gorlitsky . That 's right . Gorlitsky . I 'll call him right now . All right , thanks . I should be back in 20 minutes . Bye . Oh ! Come on ! Hey , what 's going on in there ? Miss . You okay ? Hel-help me . Hello ? is that you , dunham ? I thought you 'd quit bowling , Took up another sport . It 's been a while . I see you 're still not sleeping . Uh , not so much . No . Can you pass me a nut ? Yeah , sure . Which one ? Dealer 's choice . Perfect . What 's on your mind ? Well ... After my car accident , You said that ... I would experience things . I have . You want a beer ? Uh , it 's 6 : 30 in the morning . When you 've been up all night , Time is just a matter of semantics . No . Thanks . So I suppose you 're here To find out what happens next . Suppose I am . I can 't tell ya . You have officially gone Beyond my field of expertise . But I believe I can tell you Why you 're not sleeping . And it has nothingo do with your accident . You 're a cop . And you must make a dozen decisions a day , Many of them life and death . One of them you 're not happy about . You think you did the wrong thing . I 'm right , aren 't I ? Yeah . But it wasn 't the job . Not exactly . I , uh ... I agreed to keep a secret . A secret . Dunham . Okay , I 'm on my way . It 's a good thing you didn 't take the beer . Yeah . I 'll see you later . Hey , dunham . You 're a good person . You know , one of the few I know . If you agreed to keep this secret , I 'm sure you had a good reason . Yeah . killington ? As in skiing ? they just had a fresh snowfall . I had no idea you were a skier . Oh , yes . I was quite a hotdogger . I remember there was this secret trail . They called it " the backside , " But not for the reason you would think . It was a nude ski run . By the time you got down to the bottom , Your testicles would be in your mouth . I 'm sure agent dunham is very thankful for that image . Walter 's advocating a father-son trip . And I 'm sure agent dunham Is not interested in that . I understand that agent broyles Has a body for us to look at . Her name is miranda greene . 30 years old , unmarried . She was an attorney . Lived here in providence . Emts responded to a 911 call Phoned in by a good samaritan . She was dead by the time they arrived . Doctor . This is agent olivia dunham , This is peter bishop , and doctor - Walter bishop . John potash . I took your advanced biochem seminar , dr . Bishop . Oh . Oh , I apologize . I remember I was a bit of a slave driver . You were . But also inspiring . The truth is I was considering changing majors , But you encouraged me to stick with it and become a doctor . I never thought I 'd get a chance to thank you . Your father is a great man . Doctor , um , which one is miranda greene ? Ah , um , right this way . I 'm sorry . This might be a bit unpleasant . Ah . Epidermal blistering . Tissue necrosis . Symptomatic of cytotoxins . Could you get a sample of this pus please , peter ? I always get the good jobs . According to her coworkers , When she left for lunch , she was perfectly fine . She hadn 't mentioned any signs of illness . That was about two hours before the 911 call . Uh , I was considering that these are contact burns From some sort of synthetic chemical . No , these aren 't chemical burns . They look more like malignant tumors . Cancer ? Sarcomas , to be exact . But that kind of cancer Presents beneath the skin , not on the surface . Normally , yes . Do you have a black light ? Yeah . Somewhere . What is it , walter ? I 'm not sure . Cancers always start With a specific point of origin , And they spread from there , so ... Hmm ? Ah . Here you go . Agent broyles , lights , please . Oh . The cells near the point of origin of the cancer Should show more progression , And hence refract a different color . Oh . Like that . It looks like ... Fingers . Huh . Indeed . Right hand , I 'd say . Which indicates not only what killed this woman , But also who . Of course , somehow We 'll need to retrieve a print . Dr. Bishop , What you 're suggesting is impossible - That someone touched this woman And gave her cancer ? It seems you 've forgotten my very first lesson , doctor . When you open your mind to the impossible , Sometimes you find the truth . And they 're predicting snow next week . Hardly ideal beach weather . Why are you going to atlantic city ? I was thinking of taking peter there . Used to love saltwater taffy as a child . So what are we looking for ? Why are we cutting off this poor woman 's arm ? The handprint shows An extraordinary level of cellular detail . I 'm hoping ... Hoping to be able to remove the tumor , and ... Bake the skin , and ... Hopefully identify a fingerprint . Oh , and I 'll need two hot baths and an oven . You really think someone may have touched her And given her cancer ? Terrifying possibility , But a possibility nonetheless . Oh . We need glycerin , corn starch , And food coloring . Food coloring ? Well , not for her , But since we 're baking , We may as well make some taffy . I 've worked with miranda for about seven years . She was fairly private , But if she was sick , I think someone would know . So what sort of cases Did Miranda usually work on , Mr. Messing ? Mostly toxic tort litigation . Mm-hmm . Class action stuff . Asbestos , lead poisoning . She had a real thing About protecting those who couldn 't protect themselves . And is this what she was working on ? Yeah . She was prepping a case against intrepus pharmaceuticals . Trial was supposed to start next week . Hmm . How much money was at stake in the trial ? North eight figures . Wait , are you suggesting that - That someone did this to her ? I thought she contracted some kind of crazy disease . Well , we 're not sure , but we like to be thorough . Can we take her files on the intrepus case ? Uh , of course . Yeah . Miss greene had a bunch of meetings Scheduled for yesterday . Do you recognize any of those names ? First two are deposition prep . I don 't recognize the third one . Neil wilson . She was supposed to meet him About an hour before she died . Do you really think that intrepus pharmaceutical Killed this woman ? Maybe . You don 't ? I 've never heard of a drug That can cause what happened to miranda greene . It just seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through To kill somebody . Why not just hire a hit man ? Well , a hit man would draw too much attention . Really ? And spontaneous , fatal tumor-growth wouldn 't ? I suppose you have a point . You want to come on inside , we can noodle on it ? Maybe order a pizza ? Uh , thanks , but , no . I didn 't get much sleep last night , So I should probably head home . Anyway , I 'm not really hungry , but , um ... All right . Thank you . Oh , agent dunham . You 're up early . Yeah . I ran Neil Wilson 's number . It 's a disposable cell phone , And it was deactivated yesterday . It 's a pretty common name . I checked , and there 's more than 50 neil wilsons In the tri-state area . Do you want me to start running them down ? Oh , no . I 'm pretty sure he gave her a fake name anyway , so ... Astrid , could you give walter and I a minute ? Sure . Walter , don 't mix up the spoons . Agent dunham . Help me stir . Walter , I have to tell him . I got to tell peter the truth . But that 's not what we discussed . I know , and I 'm sorry . But he deserves to know the truth About who he is . No . No , you don 't understand . Things have never been better between us . I can 't lose him again . I can 't . You won 't . Once he knows the whole story . Walter , you saved his life . I 'm sure that he will understand . No , he won 't . He will never forgive me . I - I have to tell him . If it was the other way around , I would want him to tell me . I 'm begging you . Not yet . Please . Give me time to prepare . Please . Hey . I didn 't realize you were coming . I would have got you one too . Cappuccino . Two squirts of peppermint . Dunham . And , astrid - Tall , nonfat , double macchiato . Just the way you like it . Uh , miranda greene used her credit card At a downtown providence cafe About a half hour before she died . Sounds like her meeting with neil wilson . Excellent . Well , I 'm up for a road trip . How about you ? I remember her . Pretty lady . Comes in here all the time . She 's a lawyer , right ? Yeah . Do you happen to remember if she was with anyone The last time that she was here ? Some guy . She was taking all sorts of notes . What , does she sue doctors or something ? Excuse me ? Well , the guy she was with , He looked real pale and skinny . Dark circles under his eyes . You think he was sick ? I 'd say pretty bad . Looked my uncle did when he was fighting cancer . You thinking what I 'm thinking ? Well , I 'm thinking that cancer isn 't contagious . Well , it wouldn 't be the strangest thing we 've seen . But it would be close . Getting ready for a triathlon ? Just trying to stay healthy . You okay , sir ? Yeah , I just , uh ... You need me to call for some help ? No . No , I 'm fine . Walter , Miranda greene had lunch with someone just before she died With-with a man that may have had cancer . Does that suggest anything to you ? Cancer isn 't contagious , of course . That 's what I said . Although ... Are you familiar with the chinese notion of ch 'I , Agent dunham ? No . Dim mak . The touch ofeath . Exactly . The chinese believe That all living creatures Contain an energy , our ch 'I , And , that with proper training , A simple touch can affect their ch 'I . Reverse it . Can cause sickness , even death . Except , of course , they can 't . 'cause the touch of death is just a legend . Of course , what would be more interesting Wouldn 't be a transfer of energy , But an exchange . Meaning what ? This other man , You say that he was sick too , That he had cancer as well ? Possibly . And at the time she met him , Miss greene was perfectly healthy . Yes . Then I suggest what we 're looking at here Adheres more closely to tantric sex . Sex ? Yes . Insofar as the goal of tantric sex Is a heightened state of perception , Of awareness . The partners are not interested Merely in the sexual experience . They are seeking an exchange of energy . Okay , so what does this have to do with miranda greene ? His cancer ... For her health . It 's possible that the man That miss greene met Did this to her as a way to delay the progression Of his own disease . Hi . Lloyd becker . Oh , yeah , right . You 're alex . Alex taylor . Thanks for seeing me . Of course . Yeah . How you doing ? Come on in . Thanks . victim 's name is lloyd becker . 30 . A neighbor saw his door open . She came in and discovered his body . There 's no sign of forced entry . No sign of a struggle . Clusters of malignant sarcomas . Just like miss greene . Did anyone see the suspect ? Police canvassed the building and the neighborhood . No luck . Huh . The malignancies Appear to originate in this hand And then appear to spread out . Maybe from a handshake . That 's a fine deduction , peter . What do you see ? Nothing . Nothing that tells me why lloyd becker Was chosen as a victim . There must be a connection . Where 's walter ? The m . E. ' s gonna transport the body back to the lab . He told walter he could ride along . What ? It 's nothing . I - I think I know what it is that 's bothering you , Why it is you 've been so awkward around me For the last couple weeks . Okay . That trip down to jacksonville was crazy . We were both exhausted . We were both emotional . And , you know , if something Had happened between the two of us , I mean , if we had actually kissed , Then we 'd have to deal with that , But we didn 't . No . No , we didn 't . Right . You know , this past year , This is the longest I 've ever stayed in one place . So this thing that we have , You , me , walter , This ... This ... Uh , little family unit that we 've got going ... I don 't want to do anything to jeopardize that . I don 't either . Okay , so we 're good then , right ? Yeah . Good . I found more victims . Five deaths over the past 20 months , From chicago to hartford . Each person died from the same kind of rapid onset cancer . And healthy people keeling over like this Didn 't set off any alarm bells ? Well , a couple were considered medical anomalies , And local police looked into another , But nothing suggested it was murder . So what is it about these people That 's making them targets ? Astrid , we need to cross-reference their files , See if we can find what they may have in common . All right . I 'm on it . Timothy ober . Is his middle name michael ? Um , yeah . Timothy michael ober . Why ? You know him ? How ? I don 't know . What 's up , buttercup ? It 's past midnight . Do you feel like playing a game ? Clue ? Yeah . I thought it might be up your alley . Colonel mustard with the revolver In the billiard room . See , that 's the third time That you 've guessed the billiard room . I 've always wanted a billiard room . I thought that you would make a better detective . I detected that you needed company . You 've lived here a while , But you 're still living out of boxes . Maybe you moved around a lot as a kid . A tumultuous childhood . A hard time forming relationships . I may not be the gumshoe you are , But I 've got some skills . Well , you 're right about moving around a lot . I was a military brat . That would explain the uniform . The uniform ? Yeah , bland clothes . I don 't think I 've ever seen you In a primary color . It 's because it 's more than a job to you . You 're a soldier . Protector . God , you 'd be a blast at dinner parties . I don 't get invited to many . No . So what about you ? What made you the way you are ? Oh , I don 't know . I 'm older than I look . I barely remember my childhood . I 'm also taller than I appear . That 's it . What ? What did I say ? Hey . Hey . Uh , when we were in Jacksonville , There was a height chart on the wall with names . First name and last initial . All the kids that I was in daycare with . Yeah , all the kids From Walter and Bell 's cortexiphan trials . So while I was there , I wrote down all their names And I made a list . " Timothy o . " Timothy Ober . He was there . We were both part of walter 's tests . So that 's where you remembered him from . Uh-huh . Keep looking . Miranda g . And lloyd b . Julie h . Alan d . They 're all there . All five of his victims . So what does that mean ? Why is this guy - Killing cortexiphan kids ? I don 't know . I think we should wake up Walter . That won 't be necessary . Agent Dunham . Peter . Is it morning already ? Oh , no . No , no . It 's still the middle of the night . Walter , what is that smell ? It 's taffy . I 'm making it for peter . I think she was probably referring To your other project . Is that the killer 's handprint ? I think we 're close to getting a fingerprint . The papillary ridges On the forefingers are quite clear now . Once it 's cooled a little , I should be able to run it through the scanner . Well , whoever the killer is , He 's started to target cortexiphan subjects . Are you sure ? Yeah . Why ? Why would he do that ? Well , we were hoping you may have some idea . I don 't know . But I have an idea why they might be susceptible . To the cancer ? The energy exchange that this man is creating , I don 't think it would work on everyone . Cortexiphan was designed To-to allow children To access untapped parts of their brain , Untapped energies . So you 're saying that whatever he 's doing to his victims , Like , exchanging his illness , It could only work on cortexiphan children . Yes . I think so . So then I guess the question really is : How does he know about the cortexiphan trials ? And then how is he tracking those people down ? Now , you 've said that you and bell Never kept a list of the children That you experimented on . I didn 't . And if belly did , I never saw it . Okay , but what about Nina Sharp ? I mean , she started working with Bell around the same time . Mm-mm . We asked . Last year . When harris was tracking down nick lane and nancy lewis , We asked her . She doesn 't have a list . Yeah , but I believe that Nina Sharp Isn 't always so forthcoming . why would someone be hunting cortexiphan test subjects ? Uh , I don 't know . Walter thinks that they could be particularly susceptible . Ah . That 's troubling . Did william bell ever show you a list ? Of cortexiphan subjects ? Mm-hmm . No . And there 's nothing in the massive dynamic chives ? As I 've told you before , There 's nothing on record . Do you doubt me , agent dunham ? I don 't know . I 've always been a little foggy as to your motives . What are you implying ? Well , you 've kept information from me Since I met you - Information that has prevented me From understanding the origin of many , If not all of the cases I 've investigated While working with Fringe division . And I know about peter . I know the whole story . Does peter know ? Have you told him ? No . But I 'm going to . No . You won 't . What makes you so sure about that ? Because you haven 't told him yet . And I 'm guessing you 've had any number of opportunities . Well , I 've had my reasons for waiting . This is the right thing to do , And peter needs to know the truth . Whether or not it 's the right thing to do , I recognize the look in your eyes . I know that working together closely with someone Can bring about feelings . I 'm fairly certain That you 're not prepared to lose him . You didn 't come here today To ask me about a list That you already knew I don 't have . And you didn 't come here to announce That you 're going to tell peter who he really is . You came here ... To have me talk you out of it . Mrs. Lane ? Yes . I 'm sorry to disturb you . I - I tried calling . My name is john mchugh . I went to school with your son , nick . Uh , no , nick is my nephew . Oh . Uh ... Ah . You-you look awful . Why don 't you come inside ? Thank you . The red wire goes in the red hole . The blue in - Yes , thank you , Walter . I was able to figure that out all by myself . Hey . How 'd it go ? Uh , nina didn 't have anything . How 's it going here ? Well , we 'll soon see . Don 't be so skeptical , peter . You liked the taffy , didn 't you ? Absolutely . I have my doubts . Ready ? What 's it doing ? Familiarizing itself with the genetic composition . Dismissing any foreign elements . It 's amazing how much filth we carry around on our hands . Go ahead , dear . It worked . Of course it did . Okay , astrid , we need to run this Through the joint law enforcement database . See if we can get a name for this guy . Well done , walter . Thank you , son . Nothing . He 's not in our system . No priors , no arrest record . So ... We 're nowhere . You said you went to school with nick . A long time ago , Back in jacksonville . We have a mutual friend , lloyd becker . He said I could find nick here . I remember lloyd . Oh , such a sweet boy . Nick lived here a while After his parents died . He moved to brooklyn ... Several years ago . Do you-do you know how I could get in contact with him ? Do you have his phone number ? I 'm afraid not . I haven 't heard from him for some time . It 's funny , though . Someone else From jacksonville came by , Oh , six months ago asking for nick . She must have gone to school with you as well . You don 't by any chance remember her name , do you ? God , what am I missing ? Dunham ? I think I may have found our killer . His name is james heath , And he was a cortexiphan subject too . I think that may be how he 's doing this . James heath ? Wasn 't heath the last name of the first - Yep , of the first victim - Julie heath . Uh , she was his sister . James was in the hospital . She was visiting him , And she just suddenly collapsed and died . He was , uh , he was having chemo treatment . He had cancer . Do you have the name of the hospital Where heath was treated ? Uh , yeah . It 's abington memorial hospital . It 's just outside philadelphia . Okay . I 'll see if they have a current address for him . Thanks . You 're olivia dunham . You probably don 't remember me . My name is Nate Reed . Nick Lane gave me your address ? You and I went to school together When we were kids . Back in Jacksonville . I see . What can I do for you ? I was hoping you 'd have a few minutes to talk . Sure . Why don 't you come in ? Hello ? Peter . Peter , peter , it 's me . He 's in my house ! You stay down . I didn 't want this . I didn 't want to hurt anyone . Then why did you ? A man came to see me When I was in the hospital . He said when I was a kid Scientists had experimented on me , That because of the experiments , He could teach me how to fight the cancer . But it didn 't work . I didn 't get better . I got worse . So what happened to your sister ? She stayed with me while I was in the hospital . She never left my side . And when the pain got bad , She 'd hold my hand . For hours . And then , one day , It just happened . I called the nurses for help , But it was too late . I watched her die . But you got better . I had to find that man . I thought someone from jacksonville Might know him . And then I found timothy . And you killed him too . Not on purpose . It just happened . But that 's when I realized how it worked . I think ... If that man had never ... Come to see me , I would have died the way I was supposed to , And my sister would still be alive . They 'd all still be alive . in here . It 's okay . How come you didn 't call broyles ? I 've got you on speed dial . Really ? I 'm number one on olivia dunham 's speed dial ? Well , no , but I didn 't think That rachel or mr . Iyer from the indian takeout Would be much use . Peter ... Thank you for coming . You 're welcome . He 's in a drug-induced coma , Which seems to have stopped the progression of his cancer . Anthe man who tried to activate him , Do we know who he was ? He sounds like the same man who sanford harris hired To activate nancy lewis and nick lane . I assume the activation failed , And mr . Heath 's ... Ability Was just an unfortunate side effect . Hmm . So I don 't imagine You called me all the way down here Just to share in your victory . Aside from olivia dunham , There are still nearly a dozen unaccounted for people From the jacksonville experiments , And 30 more from the drug trials in wooster . If they all have capabilities Anything like the ones we 've seen , And if someone were to find them ... Well , philip , then we need to find them first . Agent dunham . Hello . Hi . Uh , is peter here ? Uh , no . No , he went out . Okay , good , because I would like to talk to you . Agent dunham - Walter , please . Please , walter . Just ... Let me finish . I think that you may be right . I think that maybe some truths can do more harm than good And that some pandora 's boxes Are better left unopened . So ... I 'm not gonna tell peter . Thank you , olivia . The truth is I 've done enough damage , And it 's time to start to put things right ... Whatever the consequences . And that starts with telling Peter the truth . I have to tell him who he really is .

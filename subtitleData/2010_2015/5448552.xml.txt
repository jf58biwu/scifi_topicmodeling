 Previously on Heroes . Wait a second . Is that Claire ? Hello , Claire . Samuel wants to surrender . Really ? Why ? To protect his family . He 's willing to turn himself over as long as the rest of the carnival stays safe and under the grid . I found him on the hill . With this . Peter , she 's going to kill thousands of people . It will be a bloodbath . Tell me exactly what you saw . You cannot save her . But someone else can . Don 't worry . I 'm here to save you . He 's trapped , Peter . What the hell did you do ? I went inside his head and I trapped him in his worst nightmare . He 'll never hurt anyone again . I have to bring him back . No . No , you can 't do that . You go into his head , you might not come out . Peter ! Peter , don 't ! Peter ! No ! Peter ! Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Peter ? Is that really you ? I came to get you out of here . It is you , isn 't it ? I thought I was alone here , that everyone was dead . What are you doing here ? I came to drag your sorry ass out of here . Now , let 's go . There is no getting out of here , Peter . I 've tried . For three years . Three years ? What are you talking about ? It 's been three hours . Wait a minute . You 're not really here . You 're not real . This is my mind , isn 't it ? This is my mind playing tricks on me as part of my punishment , isn 't it ? You think I 'm gonna let you taunt me ? You stay away . If you follow me , I will kill you . Do you understand me ? Sylar ! I swear I 'll kill you . Get out of my head ! Calm down . I 'm telling you the truth . I came to take you out of here . Why do you keep saying that ? I went to Parkman 's house to look for you . He put you here . This is a dream . No , it 's not a dream ! This is real . You really don 't understand that this is all just a nightmare ? Hell , yes , it 's a nightmare . Three years completely alone . Not years , hours . All right ? Parkman trapped you here . Parkman ? That 's impossible . Is it ? What 's the last thing you remember before coming here ? I remember wanting my life to change . Thinking I was going to spend all of eternity alone . Exactly . And here you are . Look , I 've got Parkman 's ability . I can take you out of here . Why would you want to do that ? The brother of the man I murdered coming to my aid ? Because I need you to help me . Look , I could leave you here to rot , but I need you to save her , my friend , Emma . In the dream , you save her before she kills thousands of people . No . You got the wrong guy . I 'm not the savior kind . You should know that better than anybody . It 's gonna happen , and you 're gonna save her . Fine . You really think you can get us out of here ? Let me see you try . Go ahead . See ? We 're not going anywhere . We 're trapped here , forever . We 've gotta do something with her . That we will , Eli . If you 'll excuse me . I want to see my father . He 's safe . Unharmed . Which is more than he deserves after shooting into a crowd of innocent people . My dad didn 't shoot anyone . If he had , you would be dead . You 're not that naive , are you , Claire ? Your father came to this carnival with a gun , intent on using it . Isn 't that why you tried to negotiate my surrender ? Because you were afraid he was gonna do something like this ? No . I want to see my father now . Your devotion to your father is touching , but you 're blinded by it . It 's time for you to open your eyes and see your father for who he really is . I know who he is . And nothing you say to me is going to change that . Of course not . That 's why I 'm going to show you . Dad . Claire . Thank God , you 're all right . Untie him . Not quite yet . Damian ? Damian has the ability to reveal a person 's memories . It 's fairly painless if you don 't fight it . You think showing me my dad 's memories is going to enlighten me ? You deserve to know the truth . Let her go , Samuel . You don 't need her anymore . You 're afraid she 'll see the real you , Bennet ? Don 't do this . Take a peek , Claire . See where it all began . All right , now , this one has it all . Whitewalls , wire wheel covers , wood grain . Everything . The kids will love it . What 's the payment look like ? Hundred-and-fifty a month . I know . That 's ... That 's kind of steep . Right , look ... You didn 't hear this from me , but you guys should go to Val 's Discount Motors on La Cienega . They 've got the same model , maybe a year older . Probably half of what you 'll pay here . Thanks . We really appreciate that . Guess who ? Let me see . Soft , lovely hands . Long , supple fingers . I don 't know . Candy ? Candy ? Oh , I 'm in trouble . It 's my wife . What are you doing here ? I just thought I 'd come by and see how the world 's most handsome salesman is doing . Well , if I see him , I 'll ask him . Me , not so good . I stink at this job . I have no killer instinct . You don 't belong here . You should be home , writing plays . Well , somebody has to pay the rent . Who needs money ? We can live on love . Wouldn 't that be nice ? What 's going on ? Something wrong ? I hope not . It 's just ... I have some unexpected news . And promise me you won 't get mad . Kate , what is it ? I 'm pregnant . I know . I know . We didn 't plan this . And you always want to be the man with the plan . Noah ? You 're happy ? Of course I 'm happy . I 'm gonna be a father . You had another wife and family ? I 'm sorry I never told you . No . It doesn 't matter . Let him go . You 're not the least bit curious about what happened to your father 's first wife ? No . No , it 's his business . If he wanted me to know ... There are reasons he kept it secret from you , Claire . Isn 't that right ? You let her go . You got what you wanted , someone to blame . Me . Look at the fear in his eyes . He knows what 's coming . I 'll leave you with Damian . I think you 'll find it very informative , Claire . Don 't do this , you son of a bitch . Did you order pot stickers ? Double order . You 're eating for two now . Can you believe this ? You and me , parents . What 's it gonna be like ? I have no idea . But I can 't wait to find out . The mu shu has arrived . Go . Go . Delivery . Yep . What happened to Mr. Yin ? He usually delivers . Yeah . He ... He couldn 't make it . So , how much do I owe you ? All of it . Noah ! I can 't move . What did you do ? Where 's the rest of the money ? How did you do that ? Kate , give him your purse . This is it ? That 's all we 've got . Take it and go . What are you ? No . Kate . Oh , my God . Kate . No . No . No . No . No . Kate . Give it up , man . Can 't go forever without talking to me . I mean , you 've gone a month . That 's impressive . There isn 't anybody out there . There never will be . I 'm not gonna spend the rest of my life here , alone with you . Ah . It isn 't exactly heaven for me , either . Here . I know you like comics . Couldn 't find Doc Savage or Flash ... What the hell is wrong with you ? You need to stop messing around and focus . Oh . Focus , right . ' Cause we gotta get out of here , so we can go rescue ... What 's her name , again ? Emma . Her name 's Emma . It 's time to face reality , Peter . That girl is gone , and if she was meant to kill thousands , they 're dead , too . Everybody 's dead except us . The only thing that 's real is us . You think you 've been here for years , but this is all just a dream . If this is all a dream , how are there books , huh ? How did Parkman make books ? Because it 's your dream . How could I possibly know all the words to Pillars of the Earth or Catch-22 ? I don 't know . Maybe you read it somewhere and it 's in your subconscious . Yeah , well , I didn 't read 9th Wonders ! I did . So now we 're in your head ? I don 't know ! I don 't know how this all works . Don 't you wanna get out of here ? Yeah . Of course . You don 't , do you ? You don 't want to get out of here . Maybe I deserve all this aloneness . This nothing . Maybe I earned it . Yeah , maybe you have . But I can 't do this on my own . I need you to help me . Okay ? All right , Peter . You want me to help you ? I want to help . Where did that come from ? That 's the wall from Parkman 's basement . What 's it doing here ? This is our way out . What ? Don 't you get it ? We have to break through . Can I help you ? I was just leaving . You 're hurt . Let me see . I 'm a doctor . Please . You don 't have to do this . I don 't want you to get in trouble . I have a hearing loss . Say that again . My name is Lauren . I came here to stop Samuel Sullivan . You 're with the man who shot everybody . Bennet . Bennet never fired his gun . Your leader , Samuel , is not what he appears to be . He 's the one responsible . He wouldn 't shoot his own people . You 're wrong . He 's done terrible things , and now he 's trying to galvanize his people around a common enemy . I gotta check in with the doc . Samuel is coming . Don 't tell him I 'm here . Everything all right ? It 's all right . I just want to talk . Well , look what we have here . Your first wife was murdered by a special ? Yeah . It was a long time ago . And the person I was then died that night with Kate . I 'm sorry I never told you , Claire . That 's okay . Some things you just can 't say out loud . But that 's the reason why you joined the Company . That 's how you became Mr. Bag-and-Tag . No . I don 't need to see any more . Don 't move . What , you want my wallet ? Take it . I said don 't move . I 'm not after your money . What , then ? Information . I know what you are . I know what you can do . How ? It doesn 't matter . I 'm looking for somebody . One of you . One of me ? What ? What are you talking about ? You mean , there 's someone else like me ? Don 't give me that . What you do isn 't normal . You have to know each other . The guy I 'm looking for is named Richard . He 's about six feet tall , got dark hair , maybe 23 years old . He can move things with his mind . He killed my wife . I don 't know anyone else like me . I swear . I don 't believe you . It was an accident . You brought a gun . I didn 't know what I would find . I was scared . That 's the first time you killed anyone , huh ? What happens next ? One owner , low miles . Hottest car I got in the lot . It 's the best I can do . So take it or leave it . Well , I thought you said ... If you don 't want it , I got another buyer over here just chomping at the bit . What 's it going to be ? I guess we 'll take it . Excellent choice . I 'll have my manager draw up the papers . Excuse me . Hey , there . Can I interest you in a car ? Not really . I 'm here to offer you a job . Do I know you ? We 've been watching you . The way you killed that special , the repairman . We 'd been tracking him , too , only you got there first . Relax . Your secret is safe with us . We 're impressed . So impressed , in fact , we 'd like you to come work for us . Who are you ? My name is Thompson . My associates and I can help you find the man who killed your wife . And then you can help us find the rest . How 's it working out for you , the " one of us , one of them " ? To tell you the truth , it 's been quite an adjustment . I mean , Claude can go invisible any time he wants . It gives him a distinct advantage . Advantage ? You 're supposed to be partners . What is it ? Trust issues ? I mean , how could it not be ? He 's abnormal . I mean , sometimes , when I 'm alone , I get this feeling in my gut that he 's watching me , you know what I mean ? Yeah . I do . You know , your case is highly unusual , Bennet . How you came to our attention , what happened to your wife . It would be only natural that you would harbor a grudge . What are you getting at ? Seventeen cases , three deaths . All attributed to you . They were all accidents . That 's been verified . Two corned beefs . You boys need anything else ? No , we 're all set . Thanks . At this point , the Company has too much invested in you to cut ties , but we do need you to make a change . Take a wife . Start a family . Is that a joke ? No . It 'll put your life in balance , calm you down , so there will be fewer incidents . A wife ? I can 't do that again . Sure you can . That cute number who brought the sandwiches will do fine . And if I refuse ? You won 't . It 's like the Company arranged your marriage . They encouraged me , but I chose your mother because I loved her . You know that . The Company seems to make a lot of decisions for you . Made . They made a lot of decisions , and that 's all over with . Everything you 're seeing now , all of it , all of the memories , that 's all they are . It 's just the past . Hello , Gretchen . Hey , Mr. Bennet , what are you doing here ? I came to see Claire . You wouldn 't happen to know where she is , would you ? No idea . You don 't have to lie for her . I know that Claire stole the compass , and I would bet good money the two of you drove out to the carnival together . My question is , why didn 't she come back with you ? She wanted to stay . She said she 'd be back on Monday . You left her there ? Do you not see what 's happening ? That she is getting involved in something that she clearly doesn 't understand ? Maybe she wants to understand it . This isn 't a game . These carnival people are killers . You don 't think I know that ? She needs to be with people like her . If they 're not good for her , you have to trust her to know the difference . You have to stop encouraging her . You need to work with me on this , Gretchen . I want her to be happy . She is happy with you , here , in college , living a normal life . What if that 's not enough for her ? It has to be . What 's he doing here ? Are you gonna erase my memory ? No . Not if you do what I ask . You were missing . I didn 't know how to find you , if I would find you . You don 't trust me . I don 't trust Samuel . And Gretchen is fine . You threatened her . And this was not some distant past . This was now . Claire ! Claire ! Hey ! You should eat . Don 't need to eat . Don 't need to sleep . Don 't need anything . Any progress today ? No . It 's just like yesterday , and the day before that . And the day before that . Now , it 's been ... I don 't even know how long it 's been . Don 't tell me how long it 's been . Can 't even dent it , Peter . I don 't know how much longer you can keep this up . As long as it takes . I know that look . You have it all the time . What look ? Like when Howie Kaplan beat you at the 50-yard dash , and you and I ran to school every morning and kept training , and kept it up , right ? That 's Nathan 's memory . That 's not yours . I told you to stop doing that . You 're not him . You 're nothing like him . So you 've told me . Look , Peter , I know that I 've said it before , but ... I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry that I killed him . I 'm sorry that I took him from you . I 'm ... Sorry ! You keep saying that . " I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry ! " It 's not gonna bring my brother back ! It doesn 't change anything . You 're right ! Nothing changes ! We 're stuck here forever . You and me . I can 't take it anymore . You 're with that Company . Cut from the same cloth as Bennet . This doesn 't have to end badly for you . You can turn yourself in . Release Bennet and his daughter . Why would I want to do that ? Because you love your family and you don 't want them to get hurt . And they will get hurt . You people are always so sure of yourselves . Don 't you think I would know what 's best for my own family ? And what is that ? Change . We 're strong enough to show ourselves , take what 's rightfully ours . You don 't have the right to take anything . Of course we do . We deserve admiration , respect . And you intend to hurt people to get it ? What would you have me do ? Continue with this life ? Live in a carnival ? Why not ? You 've lived here happily for years . Wasted years , unfulfilled years . I could have been so much more . You know about me ? About the film ? Do you know how powerful I can really be if I brought them all here ? My brother said I could move mountains , cities . I wonder , is it true ? Can I change the world ? I hope to God we never find out . What did the world ever do to you ? Should 've treated me better . Don 't do this , please . Samuel ? The Bennet girl left the House of Mirrors . Well , we 'll just have to have a word with her . It 's time to gather the family . Tell them to pack up . We 're moving on to bigger and better things . Tell them it 's gonna be the greatest show we 've ever done . You 've been quite helpful , Lauren . Eli , you and your friends take care of her , would you ? Thanks . What are you gonna do ? I 'm gonna end this . I can 't bring Nathan back , Peter , but I can sure as hell swing a sledgehammer . I 'm sorry to put you through that , Claire . But I hope through this painful experience , you can finally see the truth . Yeah . You were right , Samuel . My dad is a bad guy . I belong with you . You 're my hero . That 's what you want to hear , right ? That 's what this is all about ? Why didn 't you show me the memory my dad has of shooting Lydia , huh ? Or was that just not on the program ? Maybe he didn 't pull the trigger last night , but does that negate all the times that he has ? Your father , to this day , lies to you , deceives even you , his darling daughter , because he can 't trust any of us . You actually thought that I would turn on him ? You just don 't understand , do you , huh ? Maybe it was ' cause no one ever really loved you . You call these people your family , but they 're not . They fear you . Give me my dad , and we 're leaving . No . Sorry . You 're too important to me , Claire . Especially now , when everything 's ready to change . What 's going on ? Where 's everyone going ? I was talking to a new friend about who I am , what I can be . And the way she looked at me , she was so afraid . I want to see that look again , a thousand times over . Meaning what ? It 's time for our biggest show ever . No more hiding in the shadows . It 's time to show ourselves , be strong . We 're going to New York City . Bring the whole place to Central Park . Then we 'll show them how powerful we are . You can 't do that . Some lives will unfortunately be lost , but they will learn to fear us , respect us . It 's what we 've always wanted . I have never wanted that . Claire , you will inherit this new world . It 's your legacy . And you will remind them of what I 've done long after I 've gone . That 's why it 's so important for you to be a part of our family . You are desperate . And you 're small . I will never be a part of your family . You sound just like your father . I had so hoped to convince you . Maybe in time you 'll change your mind . Don 't hold your breath . Right . Your father 's back in the souvenir trailer . I had a little trouble with the government lady . We were playing some cat and mouse , but the mouse got away . So you want me to go find her ? Not worth it . Everything okay ? It will be . Claire Bennet needs some time to think about my offer . I 'm going to give her that opportunity . Claire , I want to explain what you saw . We 'll talk about it later . What is that ? Now , I 'm ready to go . New York City . Sounds fun . It will be . I 'm afraid you have to join us later . There 's some loose ends to attend to . Before Lydia died , she spoke of people who want to interfere with our plans . I 'll need you to stop them . Permanently . Happy Birthday . It 's not my birthday . Yeah . I know . You just wore out your other copy , and I saw that one digging around . I appreciate you being patient with me . Keeping me sane . It 's very kind of you , Peter . Thank you . You want to know something weird ? Every time you pick that thing up , I think you 're going to hit me with it , really hard . That is weird . Because every time I pick it up , I feel like I 'm gonna hit you with it , too , really hard . Why ? Because you are who you are . I wish I could accept your apologies . But if I forgive you , then I 'm not doing right by him . Nathan . If you let go of your anger , you 're afraid you 'll lose him forever ? So you 've held on to it this entire time ? I feel it slipping away , but when I look at you and I see you killing him . You took my brother away from me . We 've been here for I don 't know how many years , together . I 've changed . I 've repented . I 'm never going to hurt anyone ever again . And all this time , you were afraid to let me out . Peter . I 'm not that guy anymore , Peter . You know that . I know . I know you 're not . How long has it been , really ? Half a day , maybe . Feels like we were in there for years . Yeah . Does that make it any less real ? Let 's go save Emma . Yeah . Sorry to break up the love fest , but I 'm here to make sure that that doesn 't happen . There 's no signal . Claire . You 're all right ? Yeah . You ? Yeah . Here , help me get these ropes off . Is that a lantern over there ? We 're buried . How far down do you think we are ? I don 't know . Felt like we dropped 40 or 50 feet . Hello ? Anybody hear us ? Help ! Can anybody hear us ? Somebody get us out !

 Julia : Chester 's mill is a place like any other . At least it used to be Until we were cut off from the rest of the world By a mysterious dome . ( cows bellowing ) Invisible , indestructible And completely inescapable . We 're trapped . Julia : We don 't know where it came from or why it 's here , But now that we 're all trapped under the dome together , None of our secrets are safe . When I say , " jump , " You say , " how high ? " We have to tell someone . The day the dome came down , We both started having seizures . Junior : Those dundee guys , They 'll never bother you again . Clint : Please . ( grunts ) Another dome ? ( gasps ) Norrie . ( sobbing ) : I love you so much , mom . Just tell me what you want ! ( rattling ) ( cocks gun ) ( floorboards creaking ) What the hell are you doing here ? Dad , Put down the gun . I asked you a question . What are you doing in my house ? This is my house , too . Not anymore . You told me to stay away from angie . She 's not here . How would you know that ? You been stalking the poor girl ? You feel like locking her up for another week ? I just want to make sure she 's safe . Did you make her safe by killing clint dundee ? That 's right . I heard you shot that boy . He attacked angle . I have no sympathy for the dundee brothers , But that doesn 't qualify you to be their judge and executioner . Clint dundee got what he deserved . Who are you to say who deserves to be punished ? You 're not in your right mind , junior . You sound just like your mother did in the end . Please don 't say that . I 'll tell you this , though You 're no son of mine . Not anymore . Now , get out . I said get out of here . One thing . Don 't you ever talk about my mother that way again . Ever . ( birds chirping ) ( shoveling ) ( man grunting ) You 're pretty good at that . ( exhales ) Nice military corners . I 'm pretty sure you 're thinking about a bed . Same shape . Yeah . Any idea when carolyn and norrie want to bury her ? They haven 't come downstairs yet . Can 't imagine losing a spouse like that . Yeah . It 's strange , huh ? What 's that ? Alice dies . Harriet has a baby . Same house ... Same day . Circle of life . ( sighs ) Too busy with your new girlfriend to go shopping , huh ? Norrie 's not my girlfriend . She 's just my girl , space , friend . ( chuckles ) How could I go shopping anyway ? Stores have all been looted . Everyone 's running low on food . You could 've taken something , too . That 's stealing . You 've never stolen anything ? No . Have you ? Of course I have , dummy . Duke caught me stealing lipstick at dee 's pharmacy once . That 's why I started candy striping . Community service . Where were you all week , angie ? I looked all over for you . The only person Who said he saw you was junior . Well , are you that surprised that I disappeared ? I 'm the screwup , right ? I never thought you were a screwup . Let 's go down to the diner . We can get something to eat there . Hey . How are you feeling ? Well , my mom just died 12 hours ago , so ... How do you think ? I 'm sorry . We 're going to the diner to get something to eat . Do you ... I 'm not hungry . But don 't you think You should ... Joe . I don 't need you to take care of me . ( liquid pouring ) mmm , thank you , thank you . Angie : You 're welcome . This is the last place in town With any coffee left . Enjoy it while you can . 'cause I don 't think this is the right climate To be growing coffee beans . ( chuckles ) I see you let yourself in . You know who else let himself in last night ? Your insane son . Come here . Saying something about clint and waylon dundee , How they 'd never hurt me again . Like ... Like a wildcat bringing me a dead mouse As some kind of sick offering . It freaked me out . Angie ... No , you promised me That you 'd protect me . I told you that I wouldn 't tell anyone About what junior did to me , And you said that you would keep him away . It won 't happen again . I give you my word . ( exhales ) Now , What can I do to make it up to you ? Well , the diner needs food . I mean , there 's a little , but it 'll go fast . I think it 'll be good to open this place up again . Rose would 've wanted that . I 'll talk to ollie densmore . We 'll come to an arrangement . You know , the day 's coming when , uh ... The only way any of us are gonna get food Is by taking it out of the ground . So , from here On out ... Got to be smart . " from here on out " ? You think the dome is gonna be here forever ? Big jim : Julia . Councilman . How are you doing ? What is that ? It 's nothing . Ollie . Ollie : I don 't expect you came out here To apologize for casting aspersions on my good name . Look , ollie ... Chester 's mill is coming up on a serious food shortage . Now , you and I , we can ... Work together to solve this situation . Share our resources . Well , I know you need my water to grow crops , but , uh ... What is it you have that I need ? Propane . Propane . Ah . Well , it 's helpful , I 'll give you that . My ancestors made do without irrigation systems Or dvd players . I expect we can get by without ' em now . So you would starve people Just to get back at me ? Course not . But I sure wouldn 't mind starving you out . When this town realizes that having you as a councilman Makes for empty stomachs , ( chuckles ) They 're gonna drum you out faster than a knife fight In a phone booth . And I 'll be more Than happy to fill your shoes . Best of luck to you , jim . Glad you came in . Feel like faking it as a deputy a while longer ? I told you I 'd be happy to stay on and help in a ... Freelance capacity . ( rattling ) Junior , what are you doing in here ? I need a gun for patrol . Well , maybe it 's better you left it here . So , what , you don 't trust me ? After what happened yesterday , I got to say that I don 't . If we weren 't so shorthanded by the dome , I would 've fired your ass . So am I on the force or not ? Let 's call it probation . And no gun until I say you 've earned it . Big jim : Linda . Linda , I need you . And you , too , barbie . Ollie densmore 's dead set on keeping that well to himself . If he thinks he can toy With this town just to satisfy his own ... Power-hungry whims , he 's sorely mistaken . Can 't we negotiate with him ? I have a better plan . Eminent domain . It 's in the town bylaws . The right of the government To confiscate private property ... Yeah , I know what it is . How do you think ollie 's gonna feel about you Just marching in there and taking his land ? That 's why I 'm bringing the police . Get carter . Junior , too . Meet me in front of the hall in an hour . So ... Are you moving back in ? Till mom and dad get back , yeah . Better get used to me being your legal guardian . Has carolyn come out of her room yet ? Nope . She 's still up there ... Sitting next to the corpse of her dead wife . You know what I 've been thinking ? What ? I 've been thinking it was your idea To go to the center of the dome . We never would 've found That egg thing if you hadn 't led us there . She had the heart attack Right when we touched it . She died because we touched it . Bad things happen when we 're together . So , as soon as carolyn 's ready , We 're just gonna find somewhere else to stay . 'cause I don 't think I should be around you anymore . Norrie ... I 'd like to be alone now . I said I 'd like to be alone . Leave me alone , joe ! ( siren whooping ) ( tires screeching ) ( car doors open , shut ) Carter : I wonder where ollie went . Big jim : Guess he figured discretion 's The better part of valor . Just like I thought . Carter , Secure the well . ( tires screeching ) ( firearms cocking ) Well , now . That didn 't take long . You 're trespassing on private property . It 's not private anymore . Ollie : Well , that 's a peculiar claim , Seeing as the deed 's been in my family For 75 years now . By whose authority was it rendered un-private ? The township of chester 's mill . Ah . So ... Your authority . ( chuckles ) I 'm afraid I don 't recognize that . Or yours , either , sweetheart , If you decide to stand with big jim rennie . In fact , anybody that stands by big jim Can look forward to a tough haul ahead . See , whatever food we produce- - With my water- - stays with us . Tell that to your precious township . Best move away from that well now , son . Go on . Scoot . ( sighs ) wendell . Kneecap . ( carter shouts , groans ) ( firearms cocking ) Linda , put your gun down . Ollie : Like I said , this is private property . ( groaning ) Any attempt to commandeer this land , This well will be met with most serious consequences . Now , get off my land . Junior ! ( firearms cocking ) You need any help ? How about you take that gun off your daddy ? Ollie : I 'm asking you nicely to leave now Before anyone else gets hurt . ♪ ( birds chirping ) You okay ? ( sighs ) norrie thinks it 's my fault that alice died . No . She doesn 't think that . Come on . I 'll let you in on a little secret . Women say a lot of things they don 't mean . Especially at that age . I 've never met anyone like her before . It 's kind of amazing , to feel that connected . It 's even more intense at the egg . The egg ? What egg ? Joe , you can trust me . If it 's something to do with the dome , We all have a right to know . ( sighs ) Yesterday ... Norrie and I , w ... We found ... This egg . Totally black . With its own little dome around it . Take me to it . Now . Barbie : Guess old ollie had a little more support Than you anticipated , huh ? Only reason those farmers are backing him Is ' cause they need his water for their crops . Whoever controls that well can expect their allegiance . When we go back there ... Yeah , hold on , hold on . When we go back ? That 's right . The three of us against all those guys ? 'cause we just dropped carter off at the clinic With his knee shot out , your son ... We 'll muster extra men , then . Linda : Jim , if we do that , It 's only gonna escalate things . There has to be a diplomatic solution here . He shot a deputy ; there 's no diplomatic solution . We go back there and we take the well . Now , I 'm gonna go round up some volunteers . We 'll meet at the diner in an hour , And we 'll move out from there . All right , hold on . I think I got another way . Come on . All right , so when jim showed us this He mentioned that there were other artesian wells , right ? So here 's ollie 's . Yeah . What about these other ones ? You got here , here ... Dried out . Why 's that ? Well , back in the day , When ollie 's family first dug their well , It siphoned off the water from all the other ones . There also used to be a small reservoir in town Before the tower was built , But ollie 's well sapped that , too . Okay , so ... Say we destroy ollie 's well . And divert the water back to the dry ones and the reservoir . That 's right . No more ollie cornering the market on h2o . We 'll need explosives . Farmers in town , they got to have fertilizer . Well , I know ollie has ammonium nitrate and blasting caps At his farm for planting season . It 's dangerous , but ... Yeah , but it 's got to be done . All right , that 's what we 'll do . We 'll see if we can 't get jim to call an audible . All right , we got a job to do . First of all , do we have enough ammunition ? Several people : Yeah . Yes . Big jim : All right , second ... Hey , phil . You ever shot a gun before ? Course I have- - my dad and my uncles were marines , So I 've been handling weapons since I was a kid . I 'm counting on each and every one of you . Let 's do this . ( others shouting ) ( indistinct chatter ) Good to see you two . Just about ready to move out . Yeah , well , b-before we do that , I think linda and I Came up with an alternative . Barbie 's gonna blow up the well . Yeah . We redirect the water to an alternate source , It 's crisis averted . What are you , a demolition expert ? What if you 're wrong ? You could contaminate The town 's only remaining water supply . Then we 're worse off than we were before . Okay . Your plan goes wrong , how many people die ? Damn sight fewer Than if we have nothing to drink . Now , get this through your heads . The only objective is the well . The only obstacle is ollie . The only way we nip this in the bud Is to make an example of him . We get ollie , we get the well , Everyone gets water , we start growing food again . Well , I guess he 's not giving us his blessing . Better hurry . I 'll delay him as long as I can . So , tell me , son , want to put in a application To be my number two ? How about you don 't call me " son " ? That 's fair enough . But make me understand How you decided to become a free agent . My dad kicked me out . Well , fathers and sons- - It 's never a walk in the park . And I can 't imagine Your dad 's an easy man to live with . Especially after your mother died . He took it hard . Uh ... It was , uh ... A tragic accident . Accident ? Is that what he told you ? My mother died in a car crash . Oh , that part 's true enough , But it wasn 't an accident . It was a suicide , Pure and simple . You don 't know that . Oh , but I do . I 'm sure you remember how troubled she was . You 're lying . What cause would I have to lie to you , james ? I 'll always tell you the truth . Your father , though , uh ... I doubt he ever will . When this is over , The town will be well rid of big jim rennie . Take it . It 's old as dirt , but the aim is true . I 'll give you a moment . Sometimes a man needs to be alone with his thoughts . ( door opens ) Ollie . Promise me you won 't kill him . 'cause I want to do it . ( door shuts ) Don 't you feel like the dome 's here for a reason ? I think it is . It brought us together . Me and norrie , you and barbie . Me and barbie ? Yeah .

What did you mean when you said you saw me ? Like another me ? Yeah . And you spoke to me . I did ? When we saw alice , she didn 't say anything . When you saw alice ? Yeah , yesterday . When norrie and I touched the mini-dome . But that 's something you could have mentioned , joe . ( sighs ) So ... What did I say ? I mean , the other me . " the monarch will be crowned . " The monarch will be crowned ? Yes . What do you think it means ? I don 't know ... But I need to find out . We saw alice ... And then she died . Does that mean something bad 's gonna happen to me , too ? ( water running ) ♪ ( door opens ) Oh , uh ... Sorry . I just needed to get some fresh clothes . It 's your room . I 'm just crashing here . How 'd you end up here in chester 's mill anyway ? I was supposed to go to this girls ' camp ... For reprogramming . Second horizons . Know it well . Yeah .

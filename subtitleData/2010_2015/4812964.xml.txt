 WHY WOULD WE GET HER BACK ? ( male announcer ) PREVIOUSLY ON FRINGE ... YOU MUST FACE THIS PAIN TOGETHER . THE PAIN IS HER LEGACY TO YOU BOTH . IT 'SRO THAT SHE WAS HERE . ( Pet ) OUR DAUGHTER DE FREEING US . AND NOW WE 'RE GONNA DEDICATE OURS TO MAKING SURE THAT THAT MEANS SOMETHING . YOU GOT THAT LOOK ON YOUR FACE . WHAT LOOK ? THE LOOK THAT SAYS , " I 'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU . " SHOULD I BE ? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE ? ( Peter ) THE TECH THAT GAVEHE THEIR ADVANTAGE OVER US- - I HAVE IT NOW . YOU IMPLANTED ONE IN YOURSELF ? IT GIVES ME ENOUGH INFORMATION TO DETERMINE THEIR PROBABLE FUTURES . WE 'RE GOING TO AVENGE ETTA . WINDMARK 'S NEXT . [ car engine ruing ] [ engine turns off ] SORRY I 'M LATE . THAT 'S OKAY . WHERE 'D YOU GET IT ? LET 'S JUST SAY IT WAS A SOUVENIR FOR ONE OF MY MEN . AND THIS IDENTICAL TO THE ONE THAT PETER USED ON HIMSELF ? YEAH , FROM THE BASE OF THE CRANIUM . SO HOW IIT ACTIVATED ? I 'M NOT SURE . IF DR. BISHOP FINDS OUT , WE 'D LOVE TO LEARN ANYTHING WE CAN ABOUT IT . OLIVIA , IF I HAD ANY INCLINATION OF WHAT PETER WAS DOING ... I KNOW . ASTRID SAID YOU WERE GETTING LOW ON AMMUNITION . THE RESISTANCE JUST RAIDED A WEAPONS DEPOT IN MIDTOWN . TAKE THESE FOR NOW . WE 'LL ARRANGE A MEET FOR MORE LATER . I 'VE GOT TO GO . IF THERE 'S ANYTHING ELSE I CAN DO TO HELP ... THANK YOU , ANIL . [ marker squeaking ] THERE . HE IS FORETELLING YOUR MOVEMENTS . HE HAS GAINED THE ABILITY TO RUN FUTURES . ( Walter on video ) THIS IS TAPE EIGHT . THERE IS A SCRAPYARD LOCATED IN THE TOWN OF FITCHBURG , 46 MILES NORTHST OF BOSTON . YOU WILL GOT TO FITCHBURG AND ACQUIRE AN INDUSTRIAL-SIZE ELECTROMAGNET . YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THIS KIND OF MAGNET USED IN AUTOMOBILE JUNKING , CONSTRUCTION , DEMOLITION . BUT AS I SAY , IT IS AN INDUS- - EXTREMELY LARGE AND EXTREMELY POWERFUL . OLIVIA . GOOD . YOU 'RE HERE . WE FREED ANOTHER TAPE , AND WE HAVE TO RETRIEVE A MAGNET WALTER LEFT IN FITCHBURG . WHAT 'S WRONG ? I DON 'T UNDERSTAND . WHEN DID PETER DO THIS ? I DON 'T KNOW . WHAT 'S HAPPENING TO HIM ? WHAT ARE THE MANIFESTATIONS ? HE 'S READING TIME LIKE THEY DO , THINKING AHEAD LIKE THEY CAN . HE KNOWS WHAT I 'M GONNA SAY BEFORE I SAY IT . IT 'S LIKE IT 'S HIM , BUT ... IT ISN 'T . WALTER , HE 'S CONVINCED THAT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO BEAT THEM . IF YOU COULD FIND OUT WHAT IT 'S DOING TO HIM OR IF THERE 'S A WAY TO NEUTRALIZE IT- - I 'LL START RUNNING DIAGNOSTICS RIGHT AWAY . OF COURSE , IT 'S MEANT TO BE INTEGRATED WITH ORGANIC MATERIAL . I NEED TO SEE HOW IT INTERACTS WITH AN ACTUAL BRAIN . AND WHOSE DID YOU HAVE IN MIND ? PERHAPS MY PORCUPINE MAN 'S . I PRESERVED HIS BRAIN IN FORMALDEHYDE . COULD YOU GO DOWN AND BRING ITP , LEASE ? IT NEEDS TO BE SUBMERGED IN WATER IMMEDIATELY . [ cell phone ringing ] IT 'S PETER . [ LET ME TALK TO HIM . PETER , WHERE ARE YOU ? ( Peter ) I 'M IN NEW YORK , WALTER . PETER , LISTEN TO ME . YOU MUST COME BACK TO THE LAB . WHAT YOU 'VE DONE , SON , IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS . I CAN 'T DO THAT . I CALLED TO WARN YOU NOT TO GO BACK TO ETTA 'S APARTMENT . IT 'S BEEN COMPROMISED . ( Walter ) PLEASE COME BACK TO THE LAB , PETER . WE DON 'T KNOW WHAT WE 'RE DEALING WITH HERE . I-I 'M VERY FRIGHTENED . W-WE DON 'T KNOW WHAT THAT DEVICE IS ACTUALLY DOING TO YOU . ( Peter ) I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WOULD BE CONCERNED . BUT I ALSO KNOW THERE IS NOTHING THAT I COULD SAY THAT WOULD CHANGE YOUR MIND . YOU CANNOT POSSIBLY SEE WHAT I SEE . TRUST ME WHEN I TELL YOU ... I AM IN COMPLETE CONTROL . ( Walter ) I DON 'T BELIEVE YOU ARE IN CONTROL . SON , YOU PROMISED ME . YOU SAID YOU WOULD BE THERE FOR ME . DO YOU REMEMBER- - TO KEEP ME FROMLIPPING ? I NEED YOU . I 'M BEGGING YOU . PLEASE COME BACK IN AND LET ME RUN SOME TESTS . I HAVE TO GO , WALTER . DO NOT GO BACK TO ETTA 'S APARTMENT . ( Astrid ) WHAT ARE WE GOING TOO ? DID HE SAY WHERE HE WAS ? NEW YORK . THAT 'S ALL . ETTA 'S APARTMENT ISN 'T SAFE , AND I DON 'T KNOW WHERE HE 'S GOING . I-I CAN 'T STAY HERE . I 'M CRAWLING OUT OF MY SKIN . WELL , YOU AND ASTRID NEED TO WORK ON THE TECH , DOING SO I 'M GONNA TRY AND FIND THIS MAGNET . ( Walter ) ALONE ? WE HAVE NO OTHER OPTION . WHAT ABOUT PETER ? ALL I CAN DO IS JUST KEEP OUR PROMISE TO ETTA AND--AND STICK TH THE PLAN . [ door closes ] SORRY . PLEASE , LET ME . THAT 'S ENOUGH . MORNING . GOOD MORNING . I 'M CARLOS . HOW CAN I HELP YOU ? I WOULD LIKE TO BARTER FOR A MAGNET . WHAT 'D YOU SAY ? UH , AN ELECTROMAGNET , LIKE THE ONE YOU HAVE ON THAT CRANE . WAIT HERE . I 'D LIKE TO SELL YOU THE PIPING , BUT I GOT PEOPLE DEPENDING ON ME , AND THEY NEED TO EAT . I 'M WILLING TO BARTER . LET ME KNOW . WHAT IS IT , CARLOS ? GOT A WOMAN OUTSIDE . SHE 'S ASKING FOR A MAGNET . IT 'S HER . SEND THEM . SEND THEM NOW . MY NAME IS SIMONE . CARLOS SAID YOU WERE INTERESTED IN A MAGNET . THAT 'S RIGHT . I KNOW THIS IS A LITTLE OUT OF THE ORDINARY , BUT- - YES . WE HAVE IT FOR YOU . WE 'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU . EXPECTING ME ? I 'VE BEEN WAITING MANY YEARS FOR SOMEONE TO COME FOR THAT MAGNET . COME . I 'LL SHOW YOU . THIS IS YOUR TRUCK . IT 'S BEEN YOUR TRUCK FOR 21 YEARS ... TO TRANSPORT IT . A MAN CAME HERE SOON AFTER THE INVADERS ARRIVED . THE MAN SPOKE WITH MY MOTHER . THEY TALKED FOR A LONG TIME . HE SAID HE HAD A WAY TO SAVE THE WORLD ... BUT HE NEEDED A GIANT MAGNET TO DO IT . WAS HIS NAME WALTER ? WALTER BISHOP ? I DON 'T REMEMBER HIS NAME . HE WAS OLDER ... GRAYISH HAIR . MY MOTHER ASSURED HIM THAT SHE WOULD KEEP A MAGNET PACKED UP AND READY FOR WHEN HE CAME BACK FOR IT . BEFORE SHE DIED , SHE MADE ME PROMISE TO KEEP THE CANDLE BURNING . AND I DID . IT WASN 'T ALWAYS EASY . AT TIMES , WE WERE DESTITUTE . THERE WERE PPLWHO WANTED TO SELL THE MAGNET AND THE TRUCK . THEY LOST HOPE . BUT MY MOTHER VER DID . AND NEITHER DID I. AND HERE ... HERE YOU ARE . I SENT FOR DIESEL FUEL . IT 'S ON ITS WAY . I KNOW YOU DON 'T MIND WAITING , AND YOU 'D RATHER DRIVE AFTER NIGHTFALL . HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT ? I KNOW A LOT OF THINGS . I SEE FLASHES SOMETIMES WHEN I 'M AROUND PEOPLE . LIKE BEFORE , WHEN I MET YOU , I SAW THAT YOU HAVE A BULLET IN YOUR POCKET- - A SLUG . I 'VE ALWAYS HAD A GIFT . EVEN WITH ELECTRICITY COURSING THROUGH THE NEURAL TISSUE , THE BRAIN IS DEAD ... NOT QUITE HUMAN ... MOST LIKELY DAMAGED BY THE PRESERVATION PROCESS . BUT IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WE HAVE TO GIVE THIS A SHOT . [ straining ] THE CHANCES OF THIS WORKING ... [ grunts ] ARE REMOTE AT BEST . OKAY , I 'VE GOT A CLEAR IMAGE . THE QUESTION IS ... HOW DO I ATTACH ... OH . OH , MY . IT WORKED . WHOA . THIS IS A LOT OF NEURAL ACTIVITY . I 'VE NEVEREEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS . ( Walter ) IT 'S ALL MOVING ALONG THE CEREBRAL CORTEX , WHICH CONTROLS HIGHER-LEVEL THINKING . IT STOPPED . ( Walter ) THE DEVICE MUST 'VE DETECTED THAT THE BRAIN ISN 'T SUITABLE . DID WE GATHER ENOUGH DATA TO EXTRAPOLATE ? LET 'S SEE . OKAY , IF WE TAKE THE PROCESS THAT WE JUST SAW AND THEN WE RUN IT CONTINUOUSLY , WHAT HAPPENS TO THE BRAIN OVER TIME IS ... WALTER , ARE THOSE NEW RIDGES FORMING ? HMM . THE MORE CONVOLUTIONS , THE HIGHER THE BRAIN FUNCTION IN MAMMALS . DO YOU SEE THAT ? HMM . ( Walter ) THE CEREBRAL CORTEX IS BECOMING SO THICK THAT IT 'S OVERRIDING THE AREA USED TO CONTROL EMOTIONS . REMARKABLE . CONTROLLED EVOLUTION . IT 'S WORSE THAN I FEARED . WHERE ARE THEY ? THEY SHOULD BE HERE BY NOW . I WOULDN 'T WORRY . THEY 'LL BE HERE SOON . HI . WHAT 'S YOUR NAME ? DARBY . I 'M OLIVIA . I KNOW . EVERYBODY 'S TALKING ABOUT YOU . YEAH ? WHAT ARE THEY SAYING ? THEY SAID YOU 'RE ON REWA WE . THERE 'S A BOUNTY ON YO REALLY ? WHAT ELSE DID THEY SAY ? ( Carlos ) DARBY ? I HAVE TO GO . I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE THIRSTY . WHAT 'S IN IT ? WATER . WHAT 'S IN THE WATER ... A SEDATIVE ? YOU GONNA KNOCMEUT ? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? NOBODY 'S GONE TO GET DIESEL FUEL , HAVE THEY ? YOU 'RE WRONG . AHH . YOU HAVE NO FAITH . I COULD FEEL THAT WHEN YOU CAME- - I 'M DONE WITH THE PARLOR TRICKS . I WANT MY TRUCK AND MY MAGNET NOW . WHEN THE FUEL GETS HERE , YOU CAN HAVE IT ... UNLESS , OF COURS YOU 'D LIKE TO LEAVE NOW . YOUR CAR 'S OVER THERE . YOU CAN COME BACK WITH MORE PEOPLE IF YOU WANT . BUT WE 'RE STILL GONNA BE HERE . YOU LOST SOMEONE . THAT 'S AN ASSUMPBUT YOU LOST YOU COULD MAYOUR DAUGHTER ... . TWICE . ( Carlos ) FUEL 'S HERE . DID YOU THINK YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN MANIPULATE FUTURES ? I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN MAKING ADJUSTMENTS TO MINE . I HAVE BEEN MAKING ADJUSTMENTS OF MY OWN . WE KNOW YOU SWITCHED THE BRIEFCASE . WE TRACED IT BACK TO THE RESTAURANT . AND I KNEW YOU WERE AN ORIGIAT THE INTERSECTION WHEN YOU CAUSED ME TO MISS THE LIGHT . THE TWO EVENTS WERE IN CLOSE ENOUGH SUCCESSION THAT I COULD DETERMINE A PROBABLE FUTURE . I HAVE LED YOU HERE TO THIS PLACE . EVERYTHING HAS TAKEN PLACE AS I INTENDED . THIS WAS WHAT SHE SAW . THIS WAS HER LAST THOUGHT BEFORE SHE EXPIRED . YOUR EMOTIONS MAKE YOU WEAK . I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY YOUR FAITH HAS BEEN SHAKEN . BUT THERE ARE MYSTERIES TO THE UNIVERSE . MY GIFT IS EVIDENCE OF THAT . THE FACT THAT YOU ARE HERE IS EVIDENCE OF THAT . YOUR RATIONAL MIND CAN 'T MAKE SENSE OF YOUR LOSS . BUT YOUR HEART , IF YOU ALLOW IT TO , WILL FIND ITS OWN INTUITIVE WAY . I 'M GETTING A STRONG FEELING . YOUR DAUGHTER 'S STILL WITH YOU ... EVEN NOW . SIMONE , YOU HAVE A GIFT . YOU CAN SEE THINGS THAT OTHER PEOPLE CAN 'T . I DON 'T DOUBT THAT . BUT ... WHEREVER YOU THINK THIS GIFT CAME FROM OR WHOEVER YOU THINK BESTOWED IT UPON YOU , IT 'S SIMPLY AN ANOMALY . I KNOW THAT BECAUSE I 'M AN ANOMALY . I HAVE MOVED THINGS WITH MY MIND . I 'VE LIT THINGS ON FIRE . I 'VE CAUGHT BULLETS MIDAIR . I 'VE SEEN THINGS THAT PEOPLE ONLY DREAM AUT . I 'VE SEEN . THE SEAMS BETWEEN UNIVERSES RIPPED APART , THINGS THAT HUMANS SHOULDN 'T SEE . PEOPLE MAKE UP EXPLANATIONS ... ASSIGN MEANING TO THINGS WITHOUT KNOWING , BECAUSE IT 'S REASSURING . IT 'S COMFORTING . BUT I CAN 'T DO THAT ... BECAUSE I KNOW TOO MUCH . IT 'S ALL JUST NUMBS . AND THE INVADERS , AS YOU CALL THEM , THEY 'RE JUST BETTER AT MATH THAN WE ARE . THANK YOU FOR THE MAGNET . [ engine turning ] WHY ARE YOU SMILING ? BECAUSE I BELIEVE . YOU CAN 'T KNOW EVERYTHING . [ hair dryer whirring ] MORE HEAT , ASNER . [ hair dryer turns off ] I SAID " MORE HEAT , " NOT SHUT IT . PETER . I NEED YOU TO SUTURE MY SHOULDER , WALTER . I NEED MY MEDICAL KIT , DISINFECTANT , AND PAIN MEDICATION . GOT IT . HOW BADLY DOES IT HURT ? THERE IS NO PAIN . I 'VE DISCOVERED THINGS , PETER ... THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW . I 'VE RUN A DIAGNOSTIC SIMULATION . THE TECHNOLOGY YOU 'VE PUT INSIDE YOURSELF IS IN THE PROCESS OF ... COMPLETELY RESHAPING YOUR BRAIN . THE AREAS THAT RELATE TO EMOTION ... ARE BEING COMMANDEERED TO MAKE ROOM FOR MORE LOGICAL THOUGHT . SHRINKING THE NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS IN MY LIMBIC SYSTEM , SUPPRESSING EMOTIONAL MEMORY IN FAVOR OF HIGHER RATIONAL THOUGHT , ALSO EXPANDING MY CEREBRAL CORTEX . I KNOW . IF YOU COULD SEE WHAT I SEE , WALTER ... IF YOU COULD EXPERIENCE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO FULLY HARNESS THE UNTAPPED POTENTIAL OF THE HUMAN BRAIN , YOU , OF ALL PEOPLE , SHOULD KNOW THAT THERE IS NO REASON TO BE AFRAID . ARE YOU ALSO AWARE THAT THE CHAESWILL ? AND IF THAT HAPPENS , ERE 'S NOTHING I CAN DO TO GET YOU BACK . I 'M GOING TO DO THIS . I 'M GOING TO SHIFT WINDMARK 'S FUTURE SO THAT HE PASSES THROUGH THE SQUARE AT EXACTLY 7 : 19 P.M. WHEN HE DOES , I WILL KNOW THAT HE HAS BEEN RESET ONTO THE CORRECT PATH . I CAN 'T ALLOW YOU TO MAKE THAT MISTAKE . DON 'T YOU SEE , WALTER ? WHEN HE PASSES THROUGH THE SQUARE , SHE WILL BE AVENGED . WE ALL WANT WINDMARK DEAD ... BUT THE PLAN OUTLINED ON THE TAPES IS THE WAY TO DO IT . WE NEED YOU , SON . I NEED YOU . I HAVE TO GO . [ line trilling ] ( Anil ) OLIVIA . ( Olivia ) I GOT A TRUCK AND A MAGNET . I NEED SOMEPCEIG ENOUGH TO STORE THEM . ( Anil ) WE 'VE GOT A WAREHOUSE OUTSIDE THE CITY . WHEN YOU 'RE CLOSE , I 'LL HAVE SOMEONE MEET YOU AN . HEY , LISTEN , I 'M GONNA CALL YOU BACK . [ engine revs down ] [ engine stops ] HEY ! DON 'T MOVE ! HANDS UP ! [ gun cocks ] WHAT DO YOU GOT IN THE TRUCK ? NOTHING THAT YOU 'D BE INTERESTED IN . GOT ANY MONEY ? NOPE . YOU DON 'T NEED MONEY . YOU ARE MONEY . ( man ) I 'M JUST SAYING ... WITH THE MONEY WE 'LL MAKE FROM THE TRUCK AND THE SCRAPS FROM THE MAGNET , IT 'S A PRETTY GOOD SCORE . ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS ? WE COULD PULL 100 MORE JOBS AND NOT SEE THIS KIND OF MONEY . NOW GIVE ME YOUR COMM . TRUST ME , ALL RIGHT ? I 'VE GOT IT COVERED . ( man on phone ) REWARD WIRE . DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO REPORT ? I HAVE A FUGITIVE IN CUSTODY . ( man on phone ) WHAT IS YOUR LOCATION ? I DON 'T WANT TO TELL YOU WHERE I AM . I WANT TO MEET AT A TRUTH CHURCH . ( man on phone ) THIS IS UNORTHODOX . YEAH , WELL , I 'VE DONE THINGS I DON 'T WANT TO BE READ FOR . SO THE ONLY WAY THIS GOES DOWN IS AT A TRUTH CHURCH , WHERE YOU CAN 'T SCAN ME . ONCE I GET THE MONEY , I 'LL TELL YOU WHERE SHE IS . ( man on phone ) WHAT IS THE FUGITIVE 'S NAME ? OLIVIA DUNHAM . ( man on phone ) HOLD , PLEASE . ( man ) REWARD WIRE CALL- - MAN CLAIMS TO HAVE OLIVIA DUNHAM IN CUSTODY . HE WANTS THE REWARD FOR HER CAPTURE UP FRONT . ACCEPTABLE . ( man on phone ) WHAT IS THE CLOSEST TRUTH CHURCH TO YOUR LOCATION ? THERE 'S ONE IN SECTOR SEVEN . I CAN BE THERE IN AN HOUR . ( man on phone ) SEE THAT YOU ARE . AND THAT 'S HOW WE ROLL . HUH ? [ chuckles ] COME ON . YOU USED TO BE FUN . WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ? DON 'T . PUT YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD . WHERE 'S BRIGGS ? ( Walter ) OLIVIA , WHERE ARE YOU ? I 'M ON MY WAY BACK TO BOSTON . I 'VE GOT THE MAGNET . ANIL 'S GOT A PLACE WHERE WE CAN STORE IT . WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FACE ? I 'M A LITTLE BANGED UP , BUT I 'M OKAY , WALTER . UM , OLIVIA , PETER WAS HERE . WHEN ? A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO . I TRIED TO CONVINCE HIM . I SAID THAT HIS BRAIN IS BEING ALTERED , AND THAT SOON IT WILL BE IRREVERSIBLE . BUT HE WON 'T HEAR ME . I N 'KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO . WALTER , DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS ? PETER . OLIVIA . WALTER , TOLD ME ABOUT WINDMARK ... THAT HE ALMOST KILLED YOU . I HAVE ALREADY TURNED THAT TO MY ADVANTAGE . SEE THOSE STEPS DOWN THERE ? IN A F MINUTES , IF EVERYTHING GOES ACCORDING TO PLAN , WINDMARK WILL WALK UP THOSE STEPS AND PASS THAT FOUNTAIN . THEN I WILL KNOW THAT HE HAS BEEN RESET ONTO THE CORRECT PATH . HE DOES NOT REALIZE IT NOW , BUT HE WILL BE BACK ON THE TRAJECTORY THAT I WANT HIM ON . WHAT TRAJECTORY IS THAT ? THE TRAJECTORY THAT LEADS TO HIS DEATH . HE KILLED OUR DAUGHTER . AT EXACTLY 5 : 12 TOMORROW AFTERNOON , I WILL MEET HIM FACE-TO-FACE . HE WILL NOT EXPECT IT . HE WILL NOT HAVE A CHANCE TO FIGHTAC AT 5 : 13 , I WILL SNAP HIS NECK . AT 5 : 14 , HE WILL DRAW HIS LAST BREATH . PETER , I 'VE LOST YOU BEFORE OVER THIS , NOW , YOUR THINKING IS WAY AHEAD OF MINE--I UNDERSTAND THAT . BUT THE FACT THAT I AM HERE HAS GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING EXCEPT FEELING . AND SOON , YOU 'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO FEEL ANYTHING , NOT FOR ME , NOT FOR ETTA . WHEN I WAS FIGHTING WINDMARK , HE SHOWED ME ETTA 'S LAST THOUGHTS BEFORE HE SHOT HER . SHE THOUGHT OF US ... THAT DAY IN THE PARK BEFORE THEY INVADED , BEFORE EVERYTHING WENT WRONG . HER LAST THOUGHTS ... THEY WE US . I WILL KILL HIM TOMORROW . IF I REMOVE THE TECH , I WILL NOT BAB TO DO THAT . DON 'T YOU SEE ? AND WHAT IF TOMORR TOO LATE ? WHAT IF THAT TECH BECOMES PERMANENT ? ET 'S NOT GONE , PETER . WINDMARK DIDN 'T TAKE HER . YE HE DID . NO , HE DIDN 'T . SHE 'S STILL HERE WITH US . SHE IS DEAD . SHE SAVED MY LIFE TODAY WITH THE BULLETSHE BROUGHT TO U. SHE 'S ALIVE INSIDE US . AND THERE 'NOING THATINDMARK CAN DO ABOUT IT , BECAUSE THE LOVE THAT WE CAN SHARE WITH HER NOW IS IULNERABLE TO SPACE AND TIME , EVEN TO THEM . AND I KNOW THAT OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN AND THAT IT HURTS , BUT THAT 'S WHAT MAKES US HUMAN . EMOTION IS OUR WEAKNESS . NO , PETER , IT 'S OUR STRENGTH , BECAUSE IT 'S THE ONE THING THAT THEY DON 'T HAVE . NOW , WE NEED TO HOLD ON TO OUR CONNECTN TH ETTA , FEELING WHAT WE FELT FOR HER , OR SHE DIES ALL OVER AGAIN . AND WE CANNOT LET HER BE ERASED . PETER- - PETER , I 'M NOT ASKING YOU TO ABANDON HER . I 'M ASKING YOU TO HOLD ON TO HER . YOU 'RE NOT ONE OF THEM . YOU 'RE ONE OF US . WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO ME . I 'M NOT GONNA LOSE YOU AGAIN . PETER ... LOOK AT ME . I LOVE YOU . [ groans in pn ] I LOVE YOU .

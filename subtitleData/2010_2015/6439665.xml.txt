 Previously on Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D ... This device turns any moisture around it to ice , very rapidly , at a great range . That 's what you 're trying to power . A bigger version of the ice machine . This is very dangerous . What will happen to him ? They 're moving him to the Sandbox . They want to keep an eye on him . Ward ! Your attempt to cross off Fitz and Simmons failed . But Fitz may never be the same again . Since Simmons left , he 's only getting worse . Talking to himself more and more . I 'm being overly discreet with this operation . I know how long you have been searching for this , Dr. Whitehall . You have no idea . First time I drank this , I had just enlisted . It was bland , immature . But I had a hunch , and I bought a case . Mmm . Mmm . $ 10 seemed so expensive back then . And now , one bottle costs over $ 2,000 . Goes to show you , patience is most definitely a virtue . Something we 've both benefitted from . I believe in second chances . I want us to work together . I want you to become a valued member of our organization . Surrender and you will find meaning . Surrender and you will find release . Take a deep breath . Calm your mind . You know what 's best . What 's best is you comply . Compliance will be rewarded . Are you ready to comply , Agent 33 ? I will never work for HYDRA . I expected it would be a long night . Why I decided to treat myself . Mmm . Mr. Bakshi , let 's go again . - Where do we start ? - At the beginning . Like the song says , " A very good place to start . " You and I both know the Faustus Method takes time . And I 've got plenty . Morning , Theo . That smile . A breath of sunshine in an otherwise dreary morning . Oh , you are too sweet and you mix your metaphors . Have a good day . Ms. Simmons , you 're here early . Yes ! You see , those samples you gave me are quite fascinating ... I 'm gonna read all about it once you finish your report . Have it on my desk as soon as possible . I imagined they were all Ward . Imagine they 're all targets . Don 't get cocky . This is step one . - It 's all about control . - Control . I know . - Over your mind , your body . - " Don 't forget your mind ... " In the field , you need to maintain control . Whatever the situation . Hostages , bombs about to go off . So what you 're saying is , what I just did was puny and sad . Sixty-one beats per minute . Consistent the whole time . Not that puny . Speaking of not puny . Yeah , I want you to get used to this . It 's a sniper rifle . Pardon me . Just one quick question . You went to S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy , right ? You didn 't . If you did , you would 've known better than to shoot us . Apology number 470 , I 'm very sorry , Agent May . Don 't be sorry . Just wait . We just have a little wager . So , did you ... Go to the Academy ? Yeah , no . Well , have fun with inventory . And remember , Koenig likes them neat . And none of those Euro sevens with the lines through ' em . Drives him crazy . Coulson said you were a field agent with a badge and everything . More like a work-study thing . Badge , I had for , like , a day before S.H.I.E.L.D ... You know , Hartley , she loved her blade , hated guns . Idaho , if on a job , someone ended up dead , he 'd go to church , light a candle . Said it 'd balance the karma . See , I knew them . What they 'd do . Not do . So , us being work-mates and all ... You 're wondering if I 've ever taken anyone out . Have you ? Not that I know of . Hey . Don 't you have inventory ? I suppose now I do . Good afternoon , ladies . Practice . I want you to get used to the recoil . And for the record , experience doesn 't make it any easier to cross someone off . You 're alone . Should I assume ... That the entire trip was a waste of precious jet fuel ? Yep . Assume that . At least tell me that Agent 33 retired . Nope . They got to her first . It 's gone from being a land grab to a talent grab . And I 'm getting damn tired of losing our best and brightest to HYDRA . Ms. Simmons , I need everything you have on the samples you 're working on . I 'm not done . I 'm testing a second set of DNA ... Right . Just whatever you have . What I have is more questions than answers . Okay , you know what ? I get it . You don 't have time . Neither do I. The timetables have moved up and I 've been called upstairs to fill them in . No prep time , no PowerPoint , just me , pants around my ankles , talking out of my butt ! If you want , I could accompany you . Present my analysis ... No , no , no . You don 't want to go up there . The higher you go , the scarier it is . Okay . Well , what you can say is that the cells have an abnormal ability to create trace amounts of liquid nitrogen . Odd . What about the DNA markers ? Normal . The anomaly appears to be environmental , not genetic . Is that ... It 's just another acquisition . I thought that was broken for good . You clearly have a gift . A degree . I used to study engineering . You know , I could help out around here . Fix things in exchange for room and board . It 's been a while since I 've liked being somewhere . Marrakech has a long history of giving shelter to travelers hiding from their past . Why would you think I 'm hiding ? Who were you speaking to ? Huh ? They threatened me . They said you were dangerous and ... Mr. Gill , we don 't want to hurt you . Stand down , Agent . Holster your weapon . Mr. Gill , we just want to talk . If you would just hear me out . No . I can 't . " Maribel Del Mar. " Did you think I wouldn 't find out ? Sriracha ? Beer ? That 's all ? What kind of diet is that ? I also have tea . And if my diet 's such a concern , then perhaps dead drops shouldn 't involve fast food . We 'll revisit that protocol . I picked up some groceries . We 've got steak , grass-fed . Fingerling potatoes , kale , organic . It 's basic , but I do good basic . While I cook , you debrief . Do you remember Donnie Gill ? From the Academy ? I mean , I knew he was a gifted scientist . But you 're saying he 's a Gifted scientist ? Gill was struck by lightning while holding the device that created the storm . Perhaps the electrical surge infused his system with a freezing agent . It 's just speculation . They 're keeping me sequestered in the downstairs lab . I usually advance much more quickly . But they are intent on wasting my talents doing rudimentary bio-chem and molecular analysis on blind samples . It 's not about your intellect . Have you made friends ? Sir , you don 't need to worry . It 's been a tad lonely , true , but ... You weren 't asking out of concern for my feelings , were you ? Undercover is all about the relationships you make . If you 're gonna move up in HYDRA , you need to make friends . Be like Ward ? I can 't lie like he did . You don 't need to . Selective truths . You 're very likable . Use that . So , how is everyone ? Fitz is okay . He 's hanging in there . You think they 're trying to recruit Donnie Gill as a scientist ? That would be the best-case scenario . Most likely scenario , HYDRA 's looking for another weapon . From what we 've been able to piece together , Donnie Gill had limited powers when he entered the Sandbox , but ... While there , he was taught to control , amplify those powers . Lovely . And who exactly do we have to thank for that , S.H.I.E.L.D. or HYDRA ? Your guess is as good as ours . HYDRA had scientists embedded at the base . Explains how they took it so quickly . A friend of mine was stationed there . He said it got bad fast . Is that when Gill escaped ? I don 't know . What I do know is Creel wasn 't an isolated incident . I 've been told Gill 's next on HYDRA 's wish list . Told by who ? - I have a source . - A source you trust ? Very much so . Now , I want us to bring Gill in before HYDRA gets their hands on him . Fitz , you knew him better than any of us . Got anything to help us narrow the search ? Well , the last time that I saw him , he was , um ... Angry ? On drugs ? Friendly ? Sleeping ... - Yeah . - Sleeping ? No . Well , the one ... Go back one ? - Friendly ? - Friendly . Um ... He had trouble making friends . Anything else ? I don 't know . Maybe ask Jemma , if you have a contact number for her . Okay . And if you think of anything ... Yeah , we 'll work on it . May , you lead the search to find Gill . Let me know as soon as you have something . Scan satellite feeds for any temperature ... Shouldn 't Skye be here ? She 's working another angle . Well , they 're not exactly what you 'd call welcoming . They don 't give you a choice . So what do they give you ? Money ? Threats ? Torture ? Combo platter ? They 're good at convincing people . Yeah . Well , they suckered you in . No . I was never loyal to HYDRA . I was loyal to Garrett . Oh . Garrett is the reason you 're a cold-blooded killer . I don 't blame him for the choices I 've made . Right , I seem to remember you blaming your brother . Or was it your parents ? Man , I can 't keep up . My family tore me down . Garrett built me back up , the way he wanted . We 're all aware of who your family is , Ward . Not only are they respected , they 're pretty much loved . Well , every family has its secrets . Yours does , too . You ever wonder why ... You know what ? My bad . I slipped . Talked to you like a normal person . Let 's stay on task . You make the rules . HYDRA 's protocol on Gifteds is pretty straight-forward . An acquisition team is sent out to convince or capture the Gifted . If those two options aren 't possible , then they 'll take them out . Even if the Gifted doesn 't pose a threat ? A Gifted that refuses HYDRA is a threat . And threats are taken care of quickly . That 's the difference between S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA . And that 's why HYDRA will win . Because while a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent is considering right and wrong , HYDRA 's already taken the shot . Make friends . Mr. Turgeon , hello ! I was thinking of going over to Salties . Happy hour and karaoke , - could be a load of ... - Ms. Simmons . Call me Jemma . Jemma , you are wanted upstairs for questioning . Is this regarding my analysis ? It 's a security matter . Yes , these men will escort you . What did you do ? Nothing . I haven 't done anything . Well , then , I 'm sure you have nothing to worry about . Ma 'am , come with us . Floornumber 25 . Ms. Simmons . Have a seat . Leave us . Stay close . In case there are consequences . You 've been lying to us , Ms. Simmons . Not long ago , you were a Level 5 S.H.I.E.L.D. agent . Yes , before S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s fall . I was candid about my work history . You left things out . If I did , it wasn 't intentional . Stop lying . You 've been doing cellular analysis for Project Blizzard , yet didn 't inform your supervisor that you knew the subject . I didn 't realize it was Gill until yesterday . When I saw a photo in Kenneth 's file . I would have said something ... Yet you didn 't . What else are you hiding ? I didn 't want to corrupt my analysis . Analysis which I 'd done before I knew who it was . I barely knew him . You saved his life . Only because I happened to be at the Academy giving a lecture . You seem nervous . Because I am . I was escorted here by armed guards . I 'm well aware of who I work for . Hmm . Let 's discuss your previous employer . Why did you join S.H.I.E.L.D. in the first place ? I was a 17-year-old girl with two PhDs and a million questions . S.H.I.E.L.D. had the resources to help me answer them . Now they don 't and HYDRA does . So your loyalties are with us ? My loyalties are with science . So long as HYDRA allows me to do the work I want to be doing , then yes , my loyalties are with HYDRA . Well , loyalties can be tested . Why cling to the founding principles of S.H.I.E.L.D. ? Freedom , equality . Individual rights . These principles make mankind a plague on this planet . Think of a forest . It dries up and catches fire with the first spark . Now , mankind would fight that fire , leaving every individual plant perfect in its own individual way . But it 's the fire that 's perfect . Essential . Now , more magnificent plant species , like the giant sequoia , their seeds need the heat of that fire to crack open and be born . To literally rise from the ashes . And they will live for 1,000 years . You don 't need to keep burning . Rise . Be born . Sir , I hate to interrupt , but I 'd like to evaluate one of our employees and act with authority . Mr. Bakshi , I trust you to do what needs to be done . Are you ready to comply ? Maribel Del Mar , anchored in the Port of Casablanca . It 's a privately owned cargo ship . Supposed to cast off this morning , but didn 't . It 's frozen in ice . Iceberg in the Middle East ? Gill 's not subtle . Trip , how long till you can have the bus in the air ? Fifteen , tops . You heard him . You got 15 minutes to gather your gear . Excuse me , but Gill wasn 't hard to track . If HYDRA are looking , they 'll find him . The asset said HYDRA would be ready to take him out if they couldn 't capture or recruit him . Which is why we have to beat them to it . I 'll coordinate from the bus . Down to 14 minutes . Let 's get moving . They 're taking the bus . You know what that means ? Means we got the night off . Koenig 's on assignment , and he won 't be hogging the Xbox . Come on , man , why aren 't you happier about this ? 'Cause I should be going . I mean , I knew him . No need to feel bad about it . It is what it is . Skye 's asset , now Donnie . They 're keeping things from me . Yeah , they 're keeping you from an icy death . That 's it . Come on now , don 't start getting paranoid on me . Where are you taking me ? Thank you . Thanks very much . Ms. Simmons . Do you have anything warmer ? I 'll grab you something before we leave . Leave ? Where to ? We found Donnie Gill . We 've tried bringing him into the fold before . Now we have a second chance . With you , a friendly , honest face . Maybe we 'll have better luck . He 's dangerous , isn 't he ? Don 't worry . We 'll have your back every step of the way . Suit up . It 's going to get cold . You have no idea what you 're bringing down on yourself . We will find you ... I know . I want to be left alone . But you people won 't stop coming after me . So , I 'm done hiding . It 's time HYDRA learn , once and for all , I 'm not interested . I 'm not afraid . I 'm pissed off . And every HYDRA agent they send is going to feel it . Fitz , please , this is ridiculous . What exactly are you hoping to accomplish ? The asset Skye 's been talking to , it 's him . Mack was right . You 're sounding paranoid . Stop assuming the worst . They 're keeping things from me and I just want to know the truth . Fitz , you need to be honest with yourself . You are barely holding it together . There 's a reason they 're keeping things from you . I don 't think you should go in there . You are not here . I imagine you 've got a lot to say to me . Look , despite all of this , it 's really good to see you . Fitz ? Fitz ? Stop ! Stop talking ! Stop . I 'll be listening to everything . You run into any trouble , I 'll be in your ear , talking you through it . And what if he doesn 't respond well ? Then I suppose there 'll be a job opening at our laboratory . Your first jump ? Second . First was with Coulson and Lola . It 's a car . It flies . Yeah , this is my first . It 's okay to be scared . I 'm not scared . Maybe you should be . I packed your chute , and according to my ex , - my folding skills are abysmal . - Hmm . Nice thing is , this is as scary as it gets . Once you jump , physics takes over . Yeah , I 'm good . Thanks . Trip says two minutes out . Remember , Donnie Gill 's a Gifted . He could be a formidable weapon for either side . Let 's make sure it 's ours . I didn 't want to hurt you . I tried to avoid it . You tried to kill us ! No . I wanted to save you . Garrett ordered me to kill you and Simmons . He expected me to put a bullet in your head . But I couldn 't . I gave you a fighting chance to find a way out , like you always do . Like you did . Save me ? Do you ... Do you ... Do you know what the ... What you 're ... Okay . I ... I have trouble with words , so ... Um ... It 's probably best that I show you . Show me what ? Hypoxia . I found that one . That 's what you did to me . Fitz ? What are you doing ? I 'm showing you what it 's like when you are deprived of oxygen . The brain cells , they react first , they die . Three minutes , damage is permanent . Where is Skye ? Gone . They 're all gone after Donnie . And I should be there with them . But I can 't be , because of you . Because of what you did to me , I 'm damaged . Donnie ... Donnie ... Donnie Gill ? That 's why Skye was asking ... No ! I 'm not ... I don 't answer ... Fitz , listen to me . Listen ... They don 't know what they 're walking into . Hello ? Donnie ? Oh . I 'm looking for ... I 'm looking for Donnie Gill ! Hello ? You may not remember me . Agent Simmons ? Donnie . It 's nice to see you again . Who sent you ? S.H.I.E.L.D. ? HYDRA ? What side did you end up on ? I 'd like to think I 'm on your side . Get close to him . Convince him you want to help him . I saved your life once . I heard you were in trouble . Please , I need you to hear me out . Coulson , we 're not alone . Not what I hoped , but not unexpected . Proceed . Let me know when you have eyes on Gill . Copy that . Skye , you cover the door . You don 't give the orders , Trainspotting . I 'm not Scottish . Skye , protect the exit route . Roger that . Not this time . - Come on . Come on ! - Mack ! - Mack ! - Come on ! Hey ! What the hell , man ? I just took out the Boomers . The bus ! The bus ! We need to talk to the bus ! Fitz would talk about you . He described the blueprints he saw in your room . He was quite impressed . And Fitz is very hard to impress ... Get him to trust you . You 're a lot like him . Like both of us , really . We 're scientists . Wired to solve problems . Maybe before . It 's different now . No . I don 't believe you . You must miss it . Minds like ours , they need to be used . I 'm tired of being used . Don 't let him get angry . Repeat what I say . Take a deep breath . Take a deep breath , and clear your mind . Surrender and you will find meaning . Surrender and you 'll find release . Agent Simmons . Take a deep breath . Donnie didn 't escape the Sandbox ! He took the Sandbox for HYDRA ! HYDRA recruited Gill ? The brain ... Brain ... They brainwashed him . And they 're gonna re-trigger his programing if they can . How do you know this ? I spoke to Ward . We 'll talk about that when I get home . Nice work , Fitz . May , Hunter , do either of you have eyes on Gill ? Not yet . Target 's talking to HYDRA . End that conversation . Now . Copy that . You know what is best . What is best is you comply . Simmons . You think I don 't know what you 're trying to do ? You 're just like the rest of them . You liar ! What am I hearing ? Agent May shot me ! Repeat ? May shot me . Man , I wanted to be the one . Simmons is here . Repeat . Simmons is on site with HYDRA . Do we maintain her cover ? Yes , maintain her cover . - Your source ? - My source . That 's crazy . What about the primary target ? If we can 't take him in , we take him out . Do you copy ? Copy that . Copy . Is he far behind ? Not far . I 'm sorry , I tried . It 's all right . The conditions are better here anyway . Good afternoon , Mr. Gill . You . - Take a deep breath . - No ... Calm your mind . No . Please . Please ... You know what is best . What is best is you comply . I don 't ... Compliance will be rewarded . Mr. Gill , are you ready to comply ? I 'm happy to comply . Prove it then . Keep us from being followed . Let 's move . What just happened ? You laid the groundwork , gave us a second chance . He 's with us again . Let 's head out . Ice everyone inside this ship . No one leaves here alive . Exit 's this way . It 's frozen . Let me . We 're trapped . Let 's go ! The threat 's been neutralized . HYDRA doesn 't have him . And Agent Simmons ? Her cover 's been maintained . She 's safe for now . They 're leaving empty-handed . But we 're not . Nice payload . Too bad we couldn 't make off with the whole cargo ship . Want to take a bet how much tech 's in this cargo ? You 're not going to sucker me into doing your inventory , Mack . Good try though . Trip , you seen Skye ? Upstairs . In case you were wondering , I 'm all right . Nasty looking bruise on my shoulder , hurts like hell . But I deserved it . Mmm-hmm . So , we 're even , right ? We are . Bloody hell . What are you doing in here ? I don 't know . It reminds me of before . Should replace the glass if we 're going to take her out regularly . I 've been monitoring Moroccan law enforcement channels , they still haven 't found Donnie Gill 's body yet . You okay ? No . I get why Coulson kept what Simmons is doing from us . I understand , he 's protecting her . Making sure no one compromises her mission . But you knew ? I knew . I 'm scared for her . Simmons in HYDRA ? She 's a terrible liar . No , I 'm serious . I love her , but her trying to lie ? It 's a horror show . Maybe before , but not anymore . She can handle it . She 's good . She 's not the only one . We should talk . First of all , I want you to know that I see your progress . You 're an important part of this team . And I don 't want you to forget that . But I saw the recording . Your conversation with Ward . You almost killed him . But I didn 't . I 'm not a killer . I can 't look at him . I hate that he 's here . But we barely know anything about HYDRA . I need to do whatever it takes to understand the people we 're fighting . Ward is one way I 'm trying to do that . You should have told me . Maybe . I didn 't want to add to what you were already dealing with . And is ... Is there anything ... Is there anything more ? That I 'm keeping from you ? Yeah , I 'm Director . There 's a hell of a lot more . But there is one other thing you should know . Simmons is on an assignment . That 's why she hasn 't been in contact . That 's why she left . Hmm . And did she ask to go on the assignment ? Did she want to leave ? What she 's doing is very important . S.H.I.E.L.D. is becoming a problem . Do we know who is in charge ? I 'm afraid not . I 'm sorry to interrupt . I was told to bring these . Please , bring it here . Thank you . I appreciate it . Happy to comply . Donnie 's programing proved to be unstable . Ultimately , it held . One last thing . There 's a scientist in our downstairs lab . I believe her talents are being wasted . I 'd like authorization to bring her up here . So you trust her ? I do now . But if I 'm wrong , we 'll make her comply . Relieved it 's not Fitz ? Happy it 's you . That you 're okay . I 'm glad I could help . You said HYDRA had a way of convincing people . You were talking about brainwashing , weren 't you ? It 's not done often , but it 's done . It 's a lot of work and some people aren 't susceptible . It 's mostly used on high-value targets . Like you ? I wish I could say that 's what happened . But I swore I 'd never lie to you . No , I was never brainwashed . Everything I did , good and bad , I did of my own free will . Do you believe I 'm telling you the truth ? I just don 't know why . I don 't know what you hope to achieve by ... I don 't hope for me , I hope for you . I know something , and want you to believe me when I say it . Your father is alive . He 's looking for you . And someday , if you let me , I 'll take you to him . We 're done here .

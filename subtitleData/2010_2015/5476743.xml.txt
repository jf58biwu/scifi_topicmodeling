 My name is Walter Spackman 26 years old . I ran out of money , so I had to move back home . And I 'm currently washing dogs until I save up enough money to move out . But the thing is , I buried the headline . 'Cause in about two seconds everything is gonna change . Whoa , that 's so ... 10 , 9 , 8 ... Rise and shine , my little boomerang ! Up and at ' em 6 , 5 ... He who hesitates is brunch . 3 , 2 ... Lily . All work and no play makes Jack my first husband . If at first you don 't succeed , you 're a spackman . Hey ! Walter , don 't do it . It 's a death trap . Lily 's back visiting her dad . I can tell by the way the air shimmers . Also ... she texted me . Ok , he doesn 't listen to a word I say . I appreciate your concern and I know you care about me ... I care enough about you to murder anyone that hurts you , if that 's what you mean by caring . I 'm gonna be late for work . Walter , you 're too old for me to lock up in the basement , but you 're too young to know that dreams are just lies that we tell ourselves while we 're asleep . I should have told her when we were 10 and she hated her braces . I should have told her when we were 12 and she placed third in the Scripps National Spelling Bee . I could spell " laodicean " in my sleep . I should have told her when we were 16 and she blew out her knee in Kitzbuhel . I should have told her when we were 20 and she left Chicago to build the hospitals in Kenya . Yeah , like that 's a big thing . Today I am finally going to tell Lily Theroux exactly how I feel . I 'm gonna put the right words in the right order like a magic spell , and when I do , everything will be different than it was before . I 'll be different , too . Walter ? Walter . Hearts don 't break like legs break . The pieces never really mend . Wait , Walter ! Eat your toast ! Dude . Last poodle of the day ? It 's not a poodle . Give me 10 minutes . All right . Bedroom and practice room . What 's practice room ? It 's like a room that 's too big to call a closet but too small to call a bedroom ... Lucky for me I don 't own anything bigger than a toaster . Yeah , Joey Katz ... The guy who repeat fainted in Mr. Danforth 's bio class ? Right . His sister lives there . Everything works , the landlord 's decent , so we can go check it out tomorrow if you want . I got the day off at the restaurant . You still on prep ? Screw up once * and they think you don 't know the difference between a fork and a spoon . I 'm a lil cook , man . Chopping lettuce is beneath me . Lucky lounge tonight . Everybody 's going . Katie burns asked me if you 'd be there . Ever wonder where courage comes from ? - Beer . The subgenual anterior cingulate cortex . Increased activity in the cortex is what makes you brave . Lily 's back in town . How could you tell ? I 'll see you tomorrow , Walter . Lily . Walter ! I can 't believe your mom still has this old car . Yeah , the engine runs on anger and wishful thinking . Good gas mileage , too . Do you remember the minivan of sorrow ? My dad used to take me on those father / daughter road trips to crooked lake , where they have the ... the ... the tents with the fur . * And ... and he 'd make a fire , roast marshmallows , and pretend my mom wasn 't dating the strength coach for the bear and then he threw all her shoes on the front lawn and listen the " Phantom of the Opera " for three months . So bad ! You look good . Thanks . So do you . Thank you . You still washing dogs ? 9 : 00 to 5 : 00 . So , record-store clerk ... - Hu video-store clerk , bookstore clerk . The digital revolution kill my clerk work . Process server ... Lasted one day . Game-show contestant ... Locked up in the bonus round . Bread-truck driver . Nothing beats the smell of fresh-baked bad . All I 'm saying ... Is what you always say . That you could do so much better if you just wanted to . Not that there 's anything wrong with grooming pets . It 's all a part of my 10-year plan . Finding a way to live in the world that makes sense takes time , that 's mean I don 't find it . Besides ... everything 's about to change . Really ? Walter that 's great . How ? I have a special surprise for you . Just a little bit further . Okay . How did this happen ? Me . Thank you for my special surprise . That 's not the surprise . No ? Lily ... it took me a long time to understand that my life had a purpose . Is this a part of your 10-year plan ? If it 's okay with you , it 's probably better if there 's no more interruptions . This is the kind of thing I just gotta get out in one piece . Right , sorry . Continue . Lily , it took me a long time to understand that my life had a purpose . But once I did , I realize that you was always there , waiting for me to see it and ... And to recognize its value . I believe that my purpose in life is to make you happy . I think it 's something I 'd be really good at . And not because I 've studied for it or because there 's a written manual . I 'll be good at it because that 's why my heart was made . I love you the first day you moved in next door . I loved you 7th grade when you wore that same " Dexter 's laboratory " t-shirt for a year . I loved you in high school when you dated Bruce Butterworth and didn 't hang out like we used to . I loved you when you went away to change the world . I love you now even more than all those other times . It 's the best thing I do . I never told you this 'cause I was afraid of what you 'd think . But if I never told you , how would you know ? I 'm not afraid anymore . It 's important to me that you know and now you do . The end . That 's the most beautiful thing anybody 's ever said to me . I practiced in my spare time . But ... But ? When I 'm away on a project or in another country , or maybe something that feels like this amazing adventure , you 're the first person I want to call and tell about it ... Because you 're my best friend . And I know that what you said was really hard and brave and important . I don 't feel the same way you do . I wish that I did . Are you okay ? I 'm fine , thanks . Would it be better if I pretended like this never happened ? You can remember if you want I 'm pretty sure I will . Maybe this is the kind of thing that will make our friendship stronger ... You know , more durable . Spun polyester is very durable . The open weave reduces fabric stress . Come on , Walter ! Come on ! I think I 'm just gonna sit here for a little while if you don 't mind . - I don 't think it 's such a good idea . - Go away ! Please . That is so cool . Nurse administrator , call cardiac care unit . Nurse admin , all C.C.U. On average , lightning strikes the earth about 100 times every second . But your chances of getting hit by lightning while sitting on a sofa with a broken heart ... 1 in 280,000 . Walter ? First , I had this really funny joke prepared about Lily and lightning , but it doesn 't seem so funny now with you lying here all scrambled . And second , the Doctor ... Said there 's no real reason for you not to snap out of this . Okay ? No particular reason at all . So , please , give me a break . Snap . Hey . It 's me . Macklin Sportello ! Case you don 't remember , I 'm probably your best friend . Walter ? Can you hear me ? I just want you to know that , no matter what , I 'm here . I 'm here , and I 'll always be your ... When the boot hit , I felt like I was beaten with 100 sledgehammers . It was like every case of the flu I ever had at the same time . Every single part of my body hurt . My hair hurt . My eyelashes hurt . My fingernails , too . Did you know that there was , uh , is guy in a coma , but it turned out he was only paralyzed , so he was trapped inside his own body for like 30 years ? Anyway , we don 't got to talk about that now it 's just , you know .. And third , I love you like crazy . I do . Today was the day I proved I was different . This is not exactly what I had in mind . Or , as my mom would say , when God closes a door , he slams it on your fingers . My head filled with the sound of 1,000 church bells ringing . Walter ? I got struck by lightning . Well , that explains the charring on your ear . Can you hear that ? Can I hear what ? Walter , how are you ? How do you feel ? A slight numbing weakness in my extremities , problematic concentration , increased irritability ... Which is probably a result of frontal-lobe damage ... Headache , dizziness , and , of course , the ringing . Anything else ? I used to think I had a destiny and her name was Lily Theroux . But now I know I 'll never be anything but normal . You just got hit by lightning and you didn 't die . Except for that . You 're not normal . Trust me . Our winners day will also receive a trip for two to hon ... Payments of $ 29.95 ... Times with you already . Why didn 't she tell me you were my sis ... Well , you 're looking chipper ! Time to go . I 've completed all the relevant paperwork . I strangled two doctors . I think I 'm having hallucinations . I 'm sure you are , dear . Maybe it 's just a side effect from getting your brain boiled . The ringing . It 's gone . What ? Stay . So , mom ... Where 's your fake cigarette ? I quit fake smoking . It 's fake bad for you . What are you working on ? A catchy slogan for a new liquid soap campaign . Just what the world needs ... More liquid soap . Something wrong with the orange juice ? I squeezed it myself . No , it 's fine . It 's very fresh . Do you know there 's this thing that I have to go do , so I 'm gonna ... I 'm gonna do that now Walter ! Walter ... I made muffins ! Walter ! When did you get home ? Last night . I want to hug you . Is ... is that ... Okay ? Hug would be great . Thanks . Thanks . I was so worried was the hospital okay ? Walter . Yeah . Were there special treatments , like lightning rehab ? Lily , I need to tell you something . Okay , but you were pretty comprehensive the last time . Not that . Lily , something incredible happened to me . I don 't know how , but after the lightning hit me ... Dillon . Dillon ? Hi . Hey . Hey . Walter , this is my friend Dillon . We met at the water-management conference in Oslo . Hey , man . Dillon and his dad converted his bike to run on hydrogen fuel cells . How cool is that ? Yeah . Who wants lemonade ? I 'll be right back . So ... Lily tells me you guys have been friends since , like , forever . Since , like , forever . Damn it . Come on . You okay there , guy ? It 's just a stupid crab ape . Whoa . See that ? What the ... What the hell ? Aah , aah , whoa , whoa ! What the ... Man . I-I ... Sorry , I didn 't mean to ... I mean , it 's like I did anything , 'cause how could that possibly happen ? Freak . Hey , what 's up ? First of many beers . A nuking your sorrows with alcohol . Good point . Think alcohol will help me forget Lily ? I don 't think it 's possible drink that much . Sportello ! Back to the kitchen . Hey , Walter . Hey . Do I know you ? Nope . But you know my name . I know everything about you . It 's my job . Well , whatever they 're paying you , it 's too much . I 'm a 26-year-old dog groomer who lives with his mother . What 's to know ? Hey . I 'm curious ... Have you tested the limits of your ability ? It important to understand what you can and cannot do . Who are you ? Troy Hamilton . Okay , Troy Hamilton . I don 't know what the hell you 're talking about . Sure you do . I find people with special abilities ... Powers . And you , Walter ... You are very special . I think you have me confused with somebody else . Sometime we track lightning-strike victims . That 's how I found you . Look , dude , what do you want from me ? Ideally , I want you to help fight evil and make the world a better place . Creepy and crazy . Good luck with that . Walter , please ... just give me five minutes of your time . That 's all . So ... Do you work for a secret government organization that turns out to be as bad as the bad guys in the end ? I 'm a private contractor with good intentions and a clear conscience . Wasabi peanut ? Whatever I move , I can only move it three inches . It 's the worst superpower ever . It 's like having an extra thumb . You need to expand your line of thinking . Bar bets ? The circus ? You have no idea what you can do ... not yet . Invisibility ... There 's a superpower . Doesn 't exist . I checked that ability . Walter ... I know exactly how you feel . You feel lost and alone . You feel like nobody could ever understand . You feel like a mistake nature made . But that 's not who you are . Who am I ? You 're a superhero . I 'm not superhero material . Ask anyone . My talent isn 't a talent . It 's a curse . I 'm going back to washing dogs where I belong . I 'm offering you the chance to make a life that fits the size of who you really are . You want to wash dogs , wash dogs . But you 're crazier than I am if you pass up the chance to see how that life feels . Why don 't you meet the rest of the team then you can make up your mind . There 's a team ? Of course there is . You 're not the only one , Walter . There are others . I think you 'll like them and besides , you can 't fight evil all by yourself , am I right ? Okay , I 'm listening . I 've got tropical fish bigger than dog he 's tougher than he looks . Standard Op. Stolen property . Go fetch . Stolen ? Yeah , this is a very important package . And you don 't know where it is . Well , we 're hoping you have the right freaks for the job . They 're not freaks . Titus . How 's Jeannie ? Rise and shine , my little lightning rod ! All work and no play makes Walter a minimum age employee . You have questions . I don 't even know where to start . Start with me . Okay . How did you get to be ... you know ... like this . Army Intelligence . I was assigned to a unit that specialized psychic phenomena . It was my job to take something strange and beautiful and turn it to a weapon . Good times . Yeah . Turned out I wasn 't the company man that I though I was . So you quit ? No , I studied . Recruited . Build my own start-up from scratch . So that 's how the justice league came to Park Ridge , huh ? Something like that , yeah . Why lightning-strike victims ? Lightning strikes are only one of many triggers . We check for enhanced perception and paranormal skills . How many did you find ? Well , there 's a nice old lady in New Canaan who can kill lilacs with her mind . There 's a teenager in Moline who can actually predict when his cellphone is gonna ring . Most people just blow out their eardrums . Everybody , this is Walter . I 've invited him to join us , but Walter has his doubts . New guy 's coming . Mm , what does he do ? I can 't tell . Wherever it is , if Troy wanted us all here to meet him must be something special . Everybody , this is Walter . I 've invited him to join us , but Walter has his doubts . Annika can duplicate and broadcast almost any sound . Hello . Hey . Ethan can commune with members of the insect kingdom . Nice to meet you . Todd can see into the future Two minutes , give or take . Unfortunately , the farther he looks , the more it hurts . Hey . Carlos insists that we call him by his superhero identity , " the human smell . " You can probably guess what he can do . As they came face-to-face , the first thing Walter noted was the smell 's steely gaze , eyes that penetrate ... Save it , stinkbug . Sorry . Hey ... Dude . And Watts , able to alter and shape emotional states faster and more effectively than any drug known to man . What 's your secret , Walter ? I can ... I-I can ... I got ... Probably not public speaking . Walter can move any object three inches with his mind . Three inches sounds about right . Welcome . I think you 're gonna like it here . Okay . Come with me . You 're training me to be a fruit assassin ? See ? Amazing . Thank you , Sara . So ... This , Lily Theroux . What does she do , anyway ? How do you know about Lily ? Know everything about you . It 's still creepy . Lily is a blogger / humanitarian . Does she know about your power ? No . Well , in my limited experience when it comes to blogger / humanitarians You have to take the long view . Maximum range ... 17 feet , 4 inches . The face-scrunching probably doesn 't help . You can loose the stiff arm too . - Hey , Walter , it 's Macklin . - Where you been , man . I got a hot tip on another apartment . Call me . Your basic key lock contains a small cylinder . When a door is locked , a part called the tang is partially out of the cylinder . When the door is unlocked the tang rests fully inside it . You need the key to release the tang . Unless you are you . So , what you 're saying is that I could be the best locksmith ever . All my dreams are coming true . What I 'm saying is , sometimes the good guys need to walk through doors that only you can open . Can you move the same object more than once ? Three inches , three inches ? Not right away . It 's like I have to recharge or something . It 's always three inches ? That makes sense . We 're all made of atoms . Everything is and the only thing holding these atoms together is an ionic electrical attraction . The lightning must have altered your brain chemistry , allowing you to exert an electromagnetic force on the atoms in any object . But there 's only so much charge in the atoms you can access , so that would limit your ability to move them is there gonna be a quiz ? 'Cause if the is , I got to write some of this down . Let me in . I can 't ... I can 't do this . Sure you can . Concentrate . Yeah . Yeah . Where you been , man ? I left you like 20 messages . Yeah , sorry . I-I , as busy with this unexpected thing I hadn 't scheduled . Whatever . I got another apartment . This one is in ... Wicker Park ? Yeah Yeah , 1 1 / 2 bedrooms . I don 't know what that means ... 1 1 / 2 ... But should move fast on this , because I think it 's gonna go quick . Macklin , I don 't have time to look for apartments right now Walter , you always have time . Not anymore . Sorry , Macklin , I-I got to go . Who 's that ? ! Don 't ... Don 't follow me . I 'm not stalking you , Walter ! I 'm trying to be your friend ! Lightning changed you , man ! And not in a good way . See you two later . Good luck , Walter . Is Troy ... Recess is over , newbie . From now on , it 's just you and me . Let 's go . Looks like I 'm out of gas . Sucks to be you . It always comes back . See ? You want to know the key to happiness ? There 's a key ? It 's too bad it 's not a lock . I could open it . The key is to find a place where you belong ... And people to belong there with you . Sign the contract , Walter . Hey . Hey , hi . How you doing ? What ? Good . Great . I was a little worried at first , you know There 's a lot of stuff to learn , and ... And it 's hard sometimes . But the thing is , I ... Never really new what you could do before now ? No , I didn 't . Troy does that for everyone . Hey , I got an idea . Do you want to grab a beer ? Sure . Great . Yeah . I-I know a place we can go . That is a fantastic idea . The only thing smell liked more the the touch of a woman who thought he was cool was the cool touch of a bottle of beer served to him by a woman . Time you got to know the team . Okay . No beer for you , stinkbug ! Guys ? I was working in the entomology department at Texas AM one day , this stranger walks into the lab , and he asks for me by name , and he doesn 't look at me like other people normally do , like I 'm weird or something . He looks at me with kindness . And then he said ... I know exactly how you feel . You feel lost and alone . You feel like nobody could ever understand . You feel like a mistake nature made . But that 's not who you are . What ? That is awesome ! Does anyone know where the nearest Walgreen 's is ? My baby smell was like the smell of a million stinky diapers . When I got older , it got worse . I mean , I couldn 't control my aroma . Mom and dad were afraid of me . Girls were , you know , pretty much out of the question . It was like I was this lonely space mutant , except I didn 't have a homeplanet to go back to . Then Mr. Hamilton found me ... Taught me self-control . I wasn 't a mutant . I was a special mutant . Then I wasn 't alone anymore . Ever wonder why superheroes work in teams ? Family . Everybody wants one . Hey . I 'm out with the team . We 're ... we 're breaking in the new guy . Just ... Wife . Say again ? Cough medicine ? Sure . Is she okay ? Baby . There 's a ... Walgreen 's on State Street . I 'll pick some up on my way home . Come on . I hear rumors . New mission 48 . Mission ? That 's what you guys do , you go to missions ? What do you think ? You fight evil and make the world a better place , but I have no idea what that actually means . What does Troy really do ? Troy has clients . And the clients have needs . If there 's something you want found , we 'll be there . Need protection when the going gets rough , we will be there . Hoping for answers when all hope is lost , including rescue Ops , data retrieval , and courier services ? We 'll be there , too . I hope you like to travel . And our dental plan is excellent . Wait , when you say " new mission in 48 , " you mean 48 hours ? What 's the target ? Package . What kind of package ? Mr. Hamilton tells us to fetch . We fetch . Besides ... If we knew everything going in . It wouldn 't be as much fun . You need a secret identity I do ? Everybody has one . They do ? No . But you need sidekick . I do ? No . But you need a catchphrase . No . Catchphrase isn 't a bad idea . They 're good for team spirit . We 're very enthusiastic about the spirit . Okay , everybody huddle up photo Op. Yeah , yeah , photo Op Team photo ... - All right . - Okay . Now , you can smile if you want to . Everybody say , " yo . " Yo ! Yo ! Yo ! Yo ! I think your watch stopped . It was my dad 's . It 's nothing special ... I found it ... and wore So , when did you first know that you could alter emotional states ? The day after I hit puberty . Is it always happy or sad ? What about brave ? I feel like brave would come in handy . Are you altering my emotional state right now ? No , I 'm not . What 's your name ? Like , I know " Watts , " right ? But what did they call you when you were born ? If you were running across a summer lawn and your mother shouted your name , 'cause it was time for dinner , what name would she shout ? That ... is a secret nobody knows . Step up , newbie . You 're in my spot . Sit . The unit tasted of defeat and broken dreams . Captain normal smirked , his arrogance exceeded only by his one true ability ... The ability to act like a total douche bag . So , what 's your superpower ? Brandon doesn 't have one that 's why we call him " Captain Normal . " Hey , guys . I 'm going on my 20 , all right ? What do you want , Walter ? Listen , man , I 'm sorry I disappeared , but something really weird happened to me and I 've been dealing with that , so I couldn 't really do the whole apartment thing . Hey ... no worries . I 'm gonna find a place to live by myself . What .. why ? Well , yeah , I mean , if you were my roommate , maybe I could actually get you on the phone , but , I 'm not sure it 's worth the aggravation . Maybe you should lighten up a little bit . I 've been hacking romaine for three hours . You lighten up . You don 't have to be such a wad about I oh , right , right , 'cause it 's my fault . I got some people I want you to meet . Since when do you know people ? What ? No , you know what , man ? I wasted my time trying to find us a decent place to live while you chased after Lily , who treats you like a pet . I 'm not doing that anymore . But that 's cool , right 'cause you don 't have time for anything else , including finding a decent place to live , even though you 're living at home like it 's still high school . I said I was sorry ! And , just for the record , man , you suck as a friend . I remember when the 10-year plan used to be 5 . How 's that working out for you , Walter ? Just go away , man . Go . You know what ? I am not a pet . And so what if I did move back home ? Like that 's so unusual during the current economic downturn . Good night . And maybe I did add five years to my five-year plan . Is that so wrong ? Exactly . You really like beer . I really want be a part of this team Well , then all you need a catchphrase . Wait , I got one . Where 's the smell ? Do not see him ... They will . Do not fear him they should . Chicks did him men want to be his friend . Has no zits . That 'll be him No . My God ! What did you do ? ! Dude , that was nothing . Just a little taste . But ... Look , I heard what that cook guy said . Mutant solidarity is the cornerstone of my philosophy . You have a philosophy ? Carlos ... what ? ! - It 's Troy . How did it go ? - Sorry , I didn 't know it was you . How did it go ? God , what is that smell ? ! Great . Just great . Walter , better that we 're not around . Come on . Wait , my catchphrase ! " Up , up , and a limited distance away ! " Good catchphrase . Wait a minute . You said we all ... Pretty awesome , right ? My mom made it . She ... she thinks it 's for drama club . Welcome to the team , Walter . First Op in 36 hours . I 'm gonna go change ... Before the Op. Sorry to pop in like this . I just wanted to see how you were doing . Great , never better . S-super good . You 're scared to death . Every cell in my body is screaming . That 's 70 trillion cells . Do something for me . Step to the window look at the stars . I can 't see them that 's probably due to city lights , but there could also be cloud cover or a smog layer . Walter ... You can 't see the stars , but you know they 're up there . It 's not faith or a good guess ... It 's a fact . Courage inside you is like the stars . You can 't see it , but you know is there . That 's a fact . I decided at a very early age ... 4 , actually ... That I was going to learn the answer to every question . And I did , to the exclusion of almost everything else . And then , one day , there I was , and my head was full of answers . And that 's when I realized ... I forgot all the questions . Except the first one . What was your first question ? " Where 's dad ? " You never know your father ? Well , he died when I was 3 . A boy should know his dad . Got a few boxes of old records ... And his watch . And a photograph I used to keep it by my bed . But it wasn 't memory , you know ? It was just a picture . Like an insert in frame you buy . And all that did was make me sadder . So I put it away . Well , do me a favor . Put it back . Okay . Get some sleep . It 's a big day tomorrow Club soda and lime . Men 's room . - Please excuse me . - Da . Hello , Dr. Husak . I almost forgot . What did you forget ? Home . There was an island in the middle of the lake , and on the island there was the ruins of a church it said the bones of a Saint were buried in the soil . I was only 8 years old . We took an old rowboat , my sister Vladka and me , and we rowed out to the island . And all day we looked for the bones . Vladka . I haven 't thought of her in years . Where is it , Pavel ? Where is what ? The package . It 's in the warehouse on the last key road . Locked up like fort Knox . Kobe is a better player , sure but LeBron 's just playing better , all right ? It 's like Alicia Keys ... she 's got all the tools she 's just not making great tunes . This makes sense to me , of course . However , while gaining an NBA title , Mr. Kobe has become a far better player , attaining previously unheard of performance levels ... dawg . Anthony , you sound weird . Mao , get over here , now ! Anthony ? I need to work on my ... Sports information and trivia . No kidding ... dawg . We get in , we get out . Retrieve the package and deliver it to HQ . I don 't feel like a hero . I feel like a U.P.S. Driver . Maybe the package is evil . It could happen . You can 't always be a hero . Sometimes it 's just a paycheck . Also , pace yourself . Go , go , go . Go , go , go , go , go . Go . Guys ? Guys ? Stop right there ! Down on your knees ! Hands behind your head . Hello , boys . What the hell ? You , down on the ground ! I 'm sorry . I 'm running late . Down on the ground ! Walter ? Watts , I don 't think I can do this . Walter , get up . One more door to open , and we can all go home . You got it ? Yeah . Okay . Step on it , freak . We 're on the clock . I 've never seen anything like this before . That 's what I was afraid of . Why anybody thought you belonged on my team ... Brandon . He can do it . Really ? 'Cause all I see is a f ... Freak ? You make it sound like a bad thing . Who are you ? Ok , excuse me , That 's not definitely a package . That is a little girl . Brandon , what the hell ? - Give us the kid ... - No . This is me . Stink on ! Hey . There 's nothing to be afraid of . We 're gonna take care of you . Brandon , watch out ! First guard ... he 's coming . That guy 's gonna need a new grill . Let go of me ! Let go of me ! Wait a minute . Nobody said she was the package . We don 't even know what is was doing there . Maybe somebody ... Get in the van . She 's not a package . She 's a little girl . Walter , please . Whoa , whoa , it 's okay . It 's okay . We 're not gonna hurt you . We 're here to help . Maybe this is a rescue Op. Cuff her . We can handle this , Brandon . I 've got an idea . Why don 't you ask Todd what happens when you don 't shut up and follow orders ? Happy or sad ? It 's you call . Watts , what the hell do you think you 're doing ? Till we get back to HQ , until Troy tells us exactly what 's going on , nobody 's getting cuffed . We 're the good guys , remember ? Stay in the van . My God . Call HQ . We need to get out of here now . Brandon ! They just shot Brandon . Are you alright ? Annika , call Troy . Todd , go check out Brandon . What about us ? We run , go . Go . Walter . Right . I can only do this for a limited amount of time , then it goes away till my body recharges . It 's like the electromagnetic energy ... Go , go . - Okay . - I think we 're good . What 's your name ? Cassie . Cassie , what were you doing in that room . I don 't know . I was on my way home from school . They took me . What about those men chasing you ? You know who they are ? No . Troy will know what to do , right ? This way ! That way . Up here . Go , go , go . No . Got to go back . Back ! Go , go , go , go ! Now would probably be a good time to alter their emotional states . How about sense of direction ... ? Can you do that ? I 'm not close enough So your powers are limited by how close you are to the target , just like mine ? Can we discuss this another time ? ! Go ! Now what ? Wait . I can do this . Nice work . We 're gonna need a new set of wheels . You 're kidding me . I thought were taking things . Pickup and delivery ... That 's what you said . But people are hurt . People are dying . You saw what happened to Brandon . Troy never said anything about anybody dying . We can 't think about that now , Walter . We 've got to move . Okay ? But not back to headquarters . We can 't go back there till we know it 's safe . The only safe place is the last place they 'd look . We entered a race . Well , it 's actually more of a scavenger hunt , really . And in order to win , we have to find a place to hide for three to five hours before we locate the midget and ... and get the policeman 's autograph . The last time you were here , a room full of paying customs ran screaming into the night projectile-vomiting . Okay , Walter . You can crash in the storage room Cassie ? Cassie ? What 's that ? Nothing . What kind shots did they give you ? I don 't know . How often ? Every morning . The people who give you these shots ... You know who they are ? No . Bad Guys grabbed you . Bad guys chase you . Bad guys everywhere , but you don 't know who they are or what they want ? Okay , just to sum up , after you got fried by a lightning bolt , you discovered that you could move any object three inches . Then you joined a team of superheroes to fight evil , but ended up grabbing a little girl instead . Also , one of us is really high . Sorry . It 's ... Just ... Beer . Not just for that . Also for unleashing a hellish odor in here . That was you ? Guy I know calls himself " the human smell . " That is one stinky superpower . Man . I 'm sorry , too For what ? Should have known there was something going on with you . Not this , because this is insane , but still . And the hottie ? Watts . What 's ... What 's her superpower ? She can make you happy , she can make you sad . I meet a lot of girls like that . And this , Troy guy ... You trust him ? I don 't know .. I did . Why would he send you after a little girl ? Does she have superpower , too ? I cannot believe , I didn 't see that till now You 're special , just like us . What kind of powers do you have ? Lots . How 'd you get them I was hit by lightning . Did it hurt ? Lots . They were medicating her . It 's probably an inhibitor . You think your powers will come back if they stop ? Hope not . Why ? I don 't want to be different . I 'm only 10 . I wanna be a real girl . Then I 'm gonna take care of you . So this is how you fight evil ? You kidnap little girls with superpowers ? I don 't know what this is , okay ? Look , we should call Troy . He 'll know what do . Listen , there 's a client , right ? Somebody who wants her ? Looks that way . She is scared to death . I can see that . What about this client ? What do they want her for ? I don 't know . Watts , we cannot just give her to them . Do you have a plan ? No , not yet . Then I 'm calling Troy . Wait . Please ? Just give me till the morning . I 'll think of something . Please . She left sometime during the night or early this morning . Her name 's Cassie . The package is a little girl . She 's just like us ... she has powers . Right now , the most important thing is to find her . You 're dead ! I 'm bulletproof . We know there are at least two teams in pursuit . There 's the guards from the warehouse , there 's a backup crew working with the guards ... - Literally ? - Bulletproof ? Walter , he wears body armor . She has powers . That explains why they had her , and that means that they 'll do anything to get her back . We don 't have much time . Also , there 's a mysterious motorcycle rider . What were you doing all night ? Running for our lives ! You let her get away . Enough . The only thing you need to think about is getting her back . Let me help ... please . Walter , go home . It 's been a long night for everyone . But ... Go home ! We 'll find her . Count on it ! Watts ! Hey . She 's been there all morning . You didn 't talk to her ? Are you kidding me ? What if she has laser beams in her eyes ? Look . The mysterious motorcycle rider 's a woman . Okay , look , easy rider ... I don 't want to hurt you , but if you provoke me ... Leave her alone ! Cassie , run ! Brandon ? Let go of me ! Cate ! Wh ... Hey , what are you doing ? Mission accomplished . We transfer the package to the client in the morning . Who are you ? I 'm her sister . Cassie 's special , isn 't she ? Yeah , in ways no one understands . When word got out , they came after us . Government , corporate , private . I mean , they don 't care that she 's just a kid . So , we 've been on the run ever since . I do whatever it takes to protect her , but , you know , it 's never enough . Do you know who was holding her ? It doesn 't matter they all want the same thing . Who do you work for ? It 's a long story . Who went you after my sister ? Well , there 's a client , but that doesn 't mean ... A client . Look , I don 't want to hurt Cassie . I want to help her . Really ? Why do you think your client is gonna need her ? They gonna probe and measure my little sister just like everyone else does . Where are you going ? I 'm going to get her back . Dude , game over . It 's time to go home . Walter . Where you been ? I called and texted , and you never ... You okay ? No , I 'm not . Well , look what the cat dragged in . We don 't have a cat . That 's just an expression . But if we did , I would have spent the night telling snowball that my son was missing and he didn 't answer my calls and I was afraid he was lying in the ditch somewhere ... You know , the default ditch that every mother sees in her head when her child doesn 't come home . I 'm glad you 're not dead . Thank you . Do you need anything ? No . Hello ? Her sister 's name is Cate , and all she 's trying to do is protect her . And she says this client ... Whoever it is who knows what they 'll do to her ? Troy , you said it was a package , but it 's not , and I don 't see ... I didn 't come here to talk about the mission . I came here to make sure you were all right . You said I could help you make the world better place . And we didn 't make it better , did we ? Changing the world takes time . Yeah . Well , I don 't think I can do that . I guess what I mean is ... Quit . Walter ... Your abilities have been tested . Sometimes when we 're tested , we start to doubt the things that makes us special . Is being special always this hard ? It gets easier over time . How is she ? Cassie ? She 's safe . What about the client ? The client expects prompt delivery . What kind of client is this , anyway ? Walter ! What about the sister ? Cate said she ... I 'll handle the sister ! Cassie is at HQ , safe and sound . We transfer her to the client in the morning . You 're off prep . Back where I belong . You ? I 'm about to do something stupid , and I need your help . Is it really stupid ? Cool . Hey . How 'd you find me ? I asked Todd then I ask Ethan . Ethan asked Annika . What 's on your mind , Walter ? I went home . Good idea . I can 't stop thinking about Cassie . Bad idea . Cassie needs my help so she can be a real girl . But in the morning , they 're transferring her to the client . I don 't even know who the client is . And by then it 'll be too late . So I 'm going rogue to save her , and I don 't care what the consequences are . Because , for the first time in my life , I know exactly what to do next . Also , it would be great if you came with me . Good speech . Thanks . I usually practice them first . What 's with him ? Never mind . How many superfreaks are out here ? It 's an HQ . Not a sideshow door . HQ is basically empty . One guard on top , a couple below . They 're armed , and they 're bored . What are you doing here ? We 're gonna get her back . Hang on a second . What are you guys doing here ? Hey . I 'm starting to think you enjoy that . Wait , are you flirting with me now ? Would it be a bad thing if I was flirting with you now ? Watts ? Shift change . On whose orders ? Midnight ... Snack . For who ? Cassie . Stop ! What the hell do you think you 're doing ? Go . Go . Let 's go . Let 's go . This is a bad idea . I know . What do you think happens next ? You 're gonna try to stop us . No . Too late . No , please . I wanna be happy . Not like this . I 'm sorry , Brandon . You think I 'm an idiot . No . No , I don 't . Come on . I 'm normal . That 's what you guys call me , right ? Captain Normal ? What 's wrong with normal ? Everything . Thank you for saving me . You 're welcome . Sorry if I got you in trouble . Trouble is my business . Trouble really isn 't his business . The important thing is that you can be a real girl now . What about you ? Don 't you want to be a real boy ? No . I mean ... Yes . I ... I 'm just me . We 'll never see you again , huh ? I hope not . Goodbye , Cassie . Bye , Walter . Cute kid . Super sweet . Hungry ? Golden Apple is open . I like pie . This is my favorite place . Why ? This is where lightning hit me . What are you gonna do now ? I don 't know . I could go home and pretend like we never met . You could probably erase my mind , right ? Maybe I 'll run away like Cassie did . Don 't go . We need you . Stay with the team . I don 't have a lot of friends , Walter . I was hoping you could be my friend ? Why ? Because you 're smart ... Funny ... And easy to talk to . Everybody wants to be my friend . Another superpower ? Sometimes it feels more like an unnecessary limitation . If I was running across a summer lawn and my mother called my name because it was time for dinner ... My name 's Tess . It 's my secret identity . It is important ... Imperative ... That I be able to trust the members of my team ... Every single one . And if I can 't ... if there 's the slightest doubt ... What are you doing here ? I set Cassie free . It 's my fault . I set Cassie free . It 's my fault . I set Cassie free . It 's my fault . They rose to their feet and ripped off an old movie dad would never shut up about . I set Cassie free . It 's my fault . Had this guy in it with a big dent in his chin . I set Cassie free . It 's my fault . They did it because they were a team . They did it because the guy before them did it . They did it to blow your mind . HQ. is my responsibility . It 's my fault . I 'm sorry , dad . Dad ? You didn 't know ? No , if Nobody tells me . Walter , follow me . Well done . Even better than I expected . I 'm confused . Yeah . I once told you I was a private contractor . With good intentions and a clear conscience . Thanks to you , my conscience is clear . I 'm still confused . I was hired to retrieve a package . The package turned out to be a little girl . That 's not what I signed on for . The client used me . They use you , too . They put me into a difficult position . I had to get Cassie out of there safe and sound , but I needed plausible deniability at the same time . That 's where you came in ... A disgruntled former employee hell-bent on saving the day . I just wanted to help Cassie , 'cause all she wanted was be a real ... - Wait a minute . - You knew ? ! Yeah , I trusted you to do the right thing . And you didn 't let me down . It 's a nice work , Walter . I hope you 'll change your mind about quitting . What do you say ? Give us a second chance . Good . What the hell happened out there ? I put my trust in someone who didn 't deserve it . There 's gonna be hell to pay . I expect that . Questions about your reliability . I expect that , too . Contracting you was my idea . Don 't make me regret , or you could find yourself , isolated . Don 't be unkind . You be careful . I 'll be careful , too . We used to be on the same team . Well , I got my own team now I like this one better . I 'll be in touch . Walter . Hey . When I was struck by lightning , a strange power was given to me . I resist at the first I eventually found common cause with a group of similarly gifted men and women who fight evil . So , basically , I 'm not washing dogs anymore . I 'm gonna save the world instead . My name is Walter Spackman . I 'm 26 years old , and this is the best break I ever had . But if I knew what happened next , I wouldn 't dance ... I 'd run .

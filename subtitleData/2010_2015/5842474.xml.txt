 COULSON : Previously on Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I. E.L. D ... TRIPLETT : A hard drive ? SKYE : It 's all the research our team 's ever done , encrypted for safekeeping . I 'll give you 24 hours to get the password and get out . Ripped By mstoll After that , bring the girl to me . You don 't have to shut people out . Yeah , I do . Eric ? - ( GASPS ) - WARD : There are things about me that you wouldn 't like if you knew . ( BREATHES SHAKILY ) He 's HYDRA . You all right ? Why 'd you leave ? I 'm good . I want this . WARD : I just got word from Fitz . We need to go right now . - SIMMONS : Where 's our bus ? - And our team ? I don 't know . Yeah , it went as expected . S.H.I. E.L.D. Implodes , and everyone wants answers . The CIA , NSA , NRO , them I can handle . But Congress ? Congress is like kindergarten . " Where is this Fridge ? What was in there ? " Who or what is a Man-Thing ? " I swear , I need a cocktail and a lobotomy . ( SIGHS ) But , apparently , my every move continues to fascinate them . Tonight 's standard-issue surveillance package includes fake yuppie not checking her texts at the bus stop , imposter homeless man , mildly offensive , and the hipster following me looks familiar . I think he 's Russian , or ... Gone . Pepper , I 'll call you back in 10 . We need to talk , Agent Hill . ( SIGHS ) May . A phone call would 've done it , but I appreciate the discretion . Thought you 'd like the night off . They must hate that you 're going to work for Stark . Most of the intelligence community would like to drop me into a dark hole . But even they can 't mess with Tony 's army of lawyers . So , for now , we 're privatizing global security . Wanna join ? Coulson needs help . And he won 't take it from me anymore . - Where is he ? - Providence base . And he 's got enough to worry about without obsessing over T.A.H.I.T.I. And who covered it up . You mean besides us ? - How much does he know ? - Enough . That they used alien biology , rewrote his memories , and that Fury did it under someone else 's direction . I wanna know who that was . You 're afraid it was Alexander Pierce ? Secretary Pierce was the man in charge , the only person Fury took orders from , and he was HYDRA . Having a man like that design your brain ? You can understand my concern . Fury took his cues from pretty high up , that much I know . But when I asked him who it was , Fury said he buried that intel when he decided not to bury Coulson . Maria , this is not the time to wax poetic . Those are his words , not mine . You knew the man , sometimes he spoke in riddles . Guess I 'll have to solve it , then . Unless you wanna ask Fury for me . Fury 's dead . ( SIREN WAILING ) I 'll believe it when I see it . ( TIRES SCREECH ) Drop your weapon ! Three minutes and 20 seconds . Really ? If you were my agents , it wouldn 't be for long . Play it again . It 's the same every time , sir . Fitz . As I said , all internal camera feeds were erased . But the hangar 's landing assist system is separate . The camera tracks movement . So after we left , everything 's normal until this . An entry log has May leaving the base a few minutes later through the front door . Only her . And then , this . Holding hands . Soon after , the plane takes off . That is all we 've got . Where are they going ? And Koenig ? Koenig must have gotten onto the plane somehow . There 's no other way in or out . The blast door and the hangar door are the only exits . And both are undamaged . So nobody attacked the place , and they weren 't running away . So why ? - Maybe Koenig got orders . - From who ? Not Fury . Is there anyone left to give orders ? Aren 't we just improvising at this point ? Still wouldn 't explain why the communication lines were cut . Or why they left their phones . Or why May just left . May walked away because I told her to . I was mad and I was mean . Then we don 't need her sorry ass . Excuse me ? With all the crap we 're facing , this is not the time to pull the rip cord , bail out . I 'll make us some food . We have to eat . - Let me help . - No , I 'll get it , actually . You stay here . Simmons . For a minute there in the field , I thought things were normal again , and then ... Why do you think they left us in the dark ? ( SIGHS ) I don 't know . But something will turn up . We just have to stay positive . For Coulson , yeah . I know . He 's had a rough go of it . Yeah . Between Garrett , and May , and seeing Audrey and ... Pancakes . Coulson 's upset about pancakes now ? That 's one way to cheer everyone up a bit , don 't you think ? I 'll see if we have any in stock . Yeah , I 'll fire up the griddle . ( RATTLING ) Night ? Day ? Sir , you 're an expert on analysis . I can see you running scenarios in your head , so what do you got ? Best case ? Agent Koenig knows something we don 't . Took a team . Kept us in the dark for our safety . ( RATTLING STOPS ) And worst-case scenario ? We 've had a wolf in the herd the whole time . ( SIMMONS SCREAMS ) ( PAINT CAN RATTLING ) - Fitz keeps the candy under his bunk . - ( CHUCKLES ) What are you up to ? I 'm just looking for the sat-phone to call the team . Make sure everyone 's all right , no one 's blown up . I got the phone . I just talked to Coulson a little while ago . - You did ? - Yeah . Sorry . Should 've told you . They 're okay . But , the sooner we get to the location , decrypt that drive ... The sooner we can rendezvous with the team . Exactly . Seemed like a smart play at the time , geo-Iocking the drive . I didn 't think it 'd backfire on us . It hasn 't backfired . The drive is supposed to be impossible to crack . ( KE YBOARD CLACKING ) Pretty specific coordinates , though . You could 've picked anywhere in the world . Why a random diner in L. A ? It was already built into my encryption , never changed it . But it 's fitting . It 's where I met Mike Peterson . It 's where this whole S.H.I. E.L.D. Roller coaster started . Plus , tactically , what do you look for in a drop site ? Public place , lots of people , multiple exits . Yep . Figured if I ever got in trouble , I 'd be safe there . You 'll be plenty safe . This , however , is not the answer . What 's the matter , a girl can 't defend herself ? In this situation , the last thing we can afford is to get pinched on a concealed weapons charge . You 're right , again . I couldn 't find any rounds anyway . Hey . We are gonna be okay . I promise , until this thing is over , I 'm not gonna let you out of my sight . FITZ : Impossible . It can 't be . No . I don 't believe it . Take a breath , Agent Fitz . Don 't tell me to take a breath . Who the hell are you ? I mean , really , come on . I don 't even know who you are . - I just went through this , remember ? - Don 't touch me . My S.O. Turned out to be a lying son of a bitch . Not Ward , okay ? Not Ward . Do you know why ? Because he 's our friend . And Simmons will find something . Go on , tell them , Jemma . - Let me work , Fitz . - Yeah , but tell them that Ward is a ... Let me work . Something else is at play here , sir . Think about it . They 're just trying to mess with our heads . They wrote that on the wall to scare us . - One step at a time . - We need to get out of here . Simmons will give her report . That 's the next step . ( SIGHS ) He died approximately 10 hours ago of asphyxiation , after May left the premises . A thin wire was used to strangle him . His trachea is crushed , partially sliced through . So it was done in a hurry . Based on the angle of the lacerations , the killer was at least 6 ' 2 " . And strong enough to lift him into ... Ward did this . ( METAL CLANGING ) Fitz ! No , no , no , don 't ! COULSON : Okay , okay ! We need to hold it together . Listen . All that anger , all that pain , you need to hold it in and focus it on Skye . She 's alive . And she just walked out of here hand in hand with someone she knows is a murderer , because she 's playing him . Just like he played us . Fitz . Fitz . We have to fix the communications . We have to track that plane . Can you do that ? ( SIGHS ) Good . If I know Skye , she 's got a plan . And we 're gonna find her before Ward figures out what that is . Come on , Skye . What 's your play ? Can 't remember the last time I sat in a restaurant . I know . It 's been all tubes , tunnels and plane food . Maybe I 'll get pie for dessert . Dessert ? I was hoping we 'd be done by the time I finished coffee . You have any idea how long it 'll take to decrypt this drive ? For you ? I figured 10 minutes . Not even close . The GPS will take a hot second to calibrate , but I 'm working on a laptop , so even at three cycles per byte , there are still terabytes of data ... Spare me the details . Give me the time frame . An hour would be a miracle . Coulson needs this yesterday . My laptop 's not a time machine , Ward . That 's the science . ( SIGHS ) I guess we 're having dessert . Can you grab me a cable ? I think there 's one in the drawer . Thanks . - ( CLICK ) - ( CHUCKLES ) That seemed to work . Fitz is using the Jumpjet 's relay to power it . He 's like a ninja with this crap . - How 's he doing ? - Freaking out . But focused on the task , which was good advice . And you ? Trust me , I 'm gonna have a major freak-out later . All right . Ward is HYDRA . You know what that means . - Garrett is alive . - And Agent Hand is dead . So they hit the Fridge . And they took out all the weapons they could possibly want . And we didn 't have a clue . So why risk coming back here ? It wasn 't to cross us off . What do you have that he wants ? I don 't know . He had all our intel on that drive . All he had to do was make a copy ... He came back for Skye . She must have encrypted that drive . And she was the only one who could crack back into it . - So they have to keep her alive . - And she can stall for time . ( COMPUTER BEEPS ) Our plane is in Los Angeles . Finally , some good news . - ( ALARM BLARING ) - Perimeter defenses activated . I should have knocked on wood just then . TRIPLETT : Multiple contacts on the ground . - They just triggered the gun turrets . - Come on . - ( KE YBOARD CLACKING ) - SKYE : You 're staring again . I 'm not allowed to do that ? I told you , it 's a complicated hack . ( SIGHS ) You 're mistaking my admiration for impatience . No , it 's impatience . Okay . Sorry . Didn 't mean to stress you out . Maybe you should duck outside . Try again on the sat-phone , just to make sure . No . We stick together , we stick to the plan . The sooner you decrypt this hard drive ... The sooner we get to them . I heard you twice the first time . Are you all right ? You look nervous . How can you tell , superspy ? Staying unnaturally still to keep from fidgeting . Maintaining eye contact to give the impression of confidence . What 's wrong ? The last time I was in this booth , I was sitting across from Mike Peterson . A good man . And now he 's a murderer . And we are FBI 's most wanted . It 's just like any moment something could go horribly wrong . Relax , you 're doing great . Hiding what I 'm thinking and feeling , it doesn 't come as easy for me as it does for you . Comes with experience . ( SIGHS ) Yeah , I guess it does . - MAN : What can I get you guys ? - OFFICER : Some coffee . ( INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ) ( SIGHS ) I wish this bunker had a bunker . These doors should hold . It 'll take some major artillery to make a dent . MALE ELECTRONIC VOICE : Hangar door deactivated . How ? That 's impossible . Take cover . Let 's go . It 's not HYDRA . It 's Special Forces . TALBOT : ( OVER LOUDSPEAKER ) On behalf of the United States Armed Forces , I order you to stand down . I repeat , stand down . COULSON : Colonel Talbot ? There have to be better things for you to do than chase four S.H.I. E.L.D. Agents . I wasn 't a huge fan before chasing you to the damn tundra , Coulson . I wouldn 't push it . I 'm flattered you came in person . Fury 's private base on North American soil ? I just had to see it for myself . If I come out , will you shoot me ? 'Cause then I won 't come out . Hold your fire , soldiers . This is one of the most classified facilities on the planet , Colonel . How the hell did you find it ? I told them . ( BIRDS CHIRPING ) ( SHOVEL CLINKS ) ( GRUNTING ) ( PANTING ) My condolences . ( MAY READING ) " T.A.H.I.T.I. Project Supervisor to Director Fury . " - We 're not criminals . - TALBOT : Great . Then we 'll take you in , you can tell us all about it . At the very least , you 're fugitives . And running away puts a bit of a guilty stink on it , don 't you think ? TRIPLETT : We 're not HYDRA . We 're Agents of S.H.I. E.L.D. Well right now , to the rest of the world , that 's the same thing . All right , I 'm gonna tell you how it 's gonna be . You give me actionable intelligence , and I 'll allow you to serve time rewarded . Your other option 's pretty much hell . Do your worst . We told you of a known HYDRA agent . He 's getting away . And your little intimidation speech is keeping us from saving the life of a fellow agent . A friend . Sister , you haven 't seen intimidation . And right now I 'm your only friend . I 'd be careful not to piss me off . The word " agent " implies that your corrupt organization still exists . Your leadership abandoned you for the private sector . And we 're gonna allow that in exchange for valuable assets like yourself . So right now , I 'd be thinking hard and fast about exactly what it is that makes you valuable . I am offering you a lifeline here , Coulson . Don 't thank me . Just take it , and we 'll be on our way . Don 't see how thanks are in order , considering you just sold me out and led the US military straight to Fury 's secret base . No , Phil . You led us straight to Fury 's secret base as part of the deal we made . You can 't be serious . You and I are gonna turn over these abandoned tunnels to the US government , who will be ever so grateful to take possession of an enemy stronghold in their backyard . What about my team ? They 're gonna have to go through the system . - Interrogation ... - Not gonna happen . Look , talk to Talbot . Cough up some meaningless intel about this place . Nothing significant , of course , nothing about S.H.I. E.L.D. ' s other installations . ( SCOFFS ) You 're still protecting your secrets . Is there anything specific you 're afraid I 'll talk about ? T.A.H.I.T.I. , maybe ? - Phil . - I 'm a liability ? Is that it ? Grow up , Phil . Of course you 're a liability . But I know you 'll do the right thing . The right thing ? That 's funny , coming from you . After everything you and Fury have done . - Look , it was for ... - For my own good , I know . I get it . You should 've been straight with me . I would 've kept your secrets like a good soldier . I always have . But , instead , you were worried about me , when you should 've been worried about anyone else ! You 're right . We should 've seen HYDRA coming . But after DC , they don 't stand a chance . - John Garrett does . - Garrett ? I heard Ward took care of him . Ward 's his secret weapon . He killed Victoria Hand , then raided the Fridge , and now he 's got Skye . Which is where we were headed until you so rudely interrupted to sweeten your deal . I vetted Ward . You wanna make this right ? Stop wasting time . TALBOT : Can we move this along ? I 'd like to tear this room apart . Sure , Colonel . Knock yourself out . - Get your people . We need to move . - " We " ? - How much longer ? - Half hour . You said that a half an hour ago . Weren 't you the one who told me to relax ? Those cops over there keep looking at us . They 're just checking out the waitress . They don 't know you 're pretending to be someone you 're not . ( LAUGHING ) Yeah ? All right . Who am I pretending to be ? My impatient boyfriend . I like that cover . What 's the longest you 've been undercover ? Like , deep undercover ? Uh ... - 16 months . - When was that ? Hmm , about five years outside of the Academy . I posed as a Russian attaché at the embassy in Warsaw . It 's got to be so hard , living a double life like that . Getting close to people only to turn on them . ( SCOFFS ) I don 't know how Garrett did it . Garrett ? Think about all that time he spent as your S.O. , getting to know you , being your mentor , only to lie to your face , betray you like that . It was difficult to accept . But , thankfully , that 's over . Because you took care of him . Can we not discuss this right now ? If you had one more moment , before you shot him in the back of the head so heroically , if he was sitting right here , and you could say anything you want , - what would you say ? - Skye ! Would you say he 's disgusting ? Would you tell him he 's a disgusting , backstabbing traitor ? Or to rot in hell ? What are you doing ? I 'm just trying to have an honest conversation for once . OFFICER : Excuse me , folks . Could I just ask you to step out for a second ? They 're starting to clear people out . We should go . - No , I think I 'm good here . - Skye , we 've been made . Come on . No . I tipped them off . Hail HYDRA . - You two ! Show me your hands , now ! - Get ' em up ! Out of the booth , nice and slow . All right , turn around . Hands on your head . Just be careful . He 's armed . Skye ! - Officers ! I surrender , arrest me . - Slow down , ma 'am . - What are you talking about ? - I 'm an agent of S.H.I. E.L.D. , a wanted fugitive . Take me in . Come on , what are you doing ? Get me out of here ! That 's it ! Come on ! ( GRUNTING ) I 'll do whatever you want , - but you should ... - ( GUNSHOTS ) WARD : Skye . Don 't run . You don 't understand ! Look ! I 'm not trying to hurt you ! ( SCREAMS ) You should be thanking me . I saved your ass . You didn 't save my ass . You turned it into a public spectacle . You let her get one over on you . That 's exactly what Garrett was afraid of . And Garrett told you to stay out of sight . He ordered me to shadow you . He knew you had a soft spot for Skye and she might take advantage of it . Well , he was wrong . We have her . And once she gives us the location , we 'll be off . SKYE : Yeah , that 's not gonna happen . Take a walk . I can handle this . Can you ? You haven 't so far . Garrett says you have five minutes . I can explain . Lying bastard ! Son of a bitch ! You lying ... - Stop ! Stop ! - ( BOTH GRUNTING ) Okay ? It 's over . You can 't win . - Stop . - ( HANDCUFFS CLICKING ) All this time , everything we 've been through . Why ? How could you ? I was on a mission . - It wasn 't personal . - " It wasn 't ... " You did not just say that . " It wasn 't personal " ? Skye , listen to me . God , you might actually believe that . That is the twisted logic that they teach you when you sign up to be a Nazi . Stop , wait . I 'm not a Nazi . Yes , you are . That is exactly what you are . It 's in the S.H.I. E.L.D. Handbook , Chapter 1 . " The Red Skull , founder of HYDRA , " was a big fat freakin ' Nazi . " That has nothing to do with today . You know , you always had that Hitler Youth look to you , so it 's really not that surprising . It 's not like that . I 'm a spy . I had a job . You 've killed I don 't know how many people . You gonna kill me now ? No . I would never hurt you . Once I crack the drive , are you just going to shoot me like you did with Thomas Nash ? Or are you gonna have someone else do it , like you did with Quinn ? I didn 't know that was gonna happen . That was all Garrett . Of course it was Garrett 's fault . It was part of the mission , right ? You 're just gonna kick back and watch me bleed until it 's your turn to pull the trigger . You think I had a part in that ? That I 'd let that happen to you ? You know how I feel about you , Skye . Wait . So even though you 've been lying to everyone about everything , you 're saying that your feelings for me ... They 're real , Skye . They always have been . ( INHALES SHARPLY ) I 'm gonna throw up . You think this has been easy for me ? Do you have any idea how hard it was ? The sacrifices , the decisions I had to make ? But I made them . Because that 's what I do . I 'm a survivor . You are a serial killer . And you know what ? You were right about one thing . I wouldn 't like the real you . Someday , you 'll understand . No , I won 't . And I will never , ever give you what you want . ( BEEPING ) Ow ! ( WINCES ) Time 's up . You can tell me where to unlock the drive , or you can tell him . Mike . Please . I know you don 't wanna do this . - It 's not up to me . - Yes , it is . I don 't care what they did to you . You 're still Mike Peterson . You 're still a father . You have a son . Who I left in your hands . I asked you to look after him , Skye . Where is he now ? He 's with his aunt , under the protection of a S.H.I. E.L.D. Team . And what is S.H.I. E.L.D. Today ? HYDRA can hurt my son anytime they want . And if I get any funny ideas about rescuing him , they push a little button and blow a hole in my skull . - Fitz-Simmons will figure out a way ... - No . There 's no way out of this , Skye . Tell us how to unlock the drive . - No . - Damn it , Skye . You could 've shot me back in Italy , but you didn 't . They made Quinn do it because there 's still good in you , Mike . And I don 't think you 're gonna hurt me . You 're right . I won 't hurt you . - ( WHIRRING ) - ( GASPS ) - ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLES ) - ( GROANS ) What did you do to him ? Stopped his heart . - His heart ... - Isn 't beating . He 's having a heart attack . I can restart it , or not . It 's your choice . ( WEAKLY ) Skye . You think I don 't wanna watch him suffer ? Not suffer , die . Garrett doesn 't think you 're gonna let that happen . - He 's a murderer . - Yes , he is . Are you ? ( GASPING ) ( HANDCUFF CLANGS ) - Okay . Stop . - Where do you unlock the drive ? - Bring him back ! - Where ? 35,000 feet . It 's not based on longitude or latitude , it 's altitude . - You 're lying . - I 'm not ! I put the password in , and I start the hack , and once we reach altitude , it unlocks . Now bring him back . ( WHIRRING ) ( GASPING ) ( HANDCUFFS CLANG ) Put the password in . Start the hack . No tricks . ( PANTING ) You son of a bitch . Get the plane in the air . I can 't . I can barely stand . ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLES ) ( GRUNTS ) That should help . ( PANTING ) HILL : ( OVER RADIO ) Maria Hill to S.H.I.E.L.D. 616 . You have 30 seconds to stand down and surrender . I repeat , stand down and surrender . You gonna answer me , Ward , or do I have to come over there ? Maria Hill . I kind of hoped you went down with the Triskelion . And I hoped you weren 't the duplicitous lowlife you turned out to be , but here we are . Gonna be honest with you , Hill , I 'm having a pretty bad day . So if I were you , I would get the hell out of my way . Mmm , give up Skye , and we 'll talk about it . - Yeah , that 's not happening . - You know , I never liked you , Ward . Not since our first sit-down . But I never figured you for John Garrett 's lapdog . A lot of us lost respect for Fury when he picked you as his second . If he needed eye candy around , he could 've at least picked Romanoff . That 's funny . I 'll tell her you said that . Now hand Skye over , or I 'll have a squad of F-16s knock you on your ass . Even if you had that kind of pull anymore , which you don 't , Coulson would never let you do it . He would never sacrifice Skye like that . But you know Garrett would . So don 't try and follow us . This doesn 't have to go down like this , Ward . You don 't owe Garrett anything . You 're wrong . ( ENGINES REV ) You want me to pursue ? No . Their tracking systems are up and running . I just hope we bought enough time . Are you okay ? Did Ward hurt you ? No , I 'm okay . But , the encrypted hard drive , I unlocked it for them . Forget that . We need to move . We 're gonna take the cockpit . - Wait . You came alone ? - It 's okay . I can take Ward . I know , but how did you get past Deathlok ? - Deathlok 's here on the plane ? - Yeah , you didn 't take him out ? - New plan . Run ! - Wait . What about you ? Get to the cargo hold . Now ! I can 't let you leave , Agent Coulson . It 's still my plane . - ( BEEPING ) - I don 't need your permission . ( ALARM BLARING ) I 've never used a parachute before ! Forget that ! Get in the car ! ( GUNFIRE CONTINUES ) Get down , get down ! Buckle up ! ( SCREAMING ) ( GRUNTING ) I told you to buckle up ! ( WHIRRING ) ( SCREAMING ) Come on ! They must 've hit the thrusters ! - ( LOUD THUD ) - ( WHIRRING ) That 'll be 20 bucks . I 'm putting the plane down . We need to go after them . - No , we don 't . We stay with the plan . - I don 't answer to you . Coulson and Skye don 't matter anymore . We have the data , and Garrett wants us back . Right now . Listen , I 'm not just gonna forget what you did to me back there . You try anything like that again , I will kill you . Wasn 't personal . I was just following orders . Wow . I can 't believe he shot Lola . I can 't talk about it . Don 't blame you for going after him . We 'll need a base of operation , weapons , tactical backup . Who do you have working for you ? Okay , wait . Hold on , Coulson . There is no more backup . No more hidden bunkers . Come on . I know Fury has others . There 's no Fury . We 're not bringing the band back together again , Coulson . It 's over . There is no S.H.I. E.L.D. Anymore . Not officially . Look , I get it , okay ? You have to take Ward and Garrett down . But don 't act like it 's some officially sanctioned mission . It 's a personal vendetta . And when it 's done , you should walk . Let your people go their separate ways . And what , turn themselves in ? Cut a deal ? Work in the private sector ? You know Stark would take you in a heartbeat . It 's not my style . ( SIGHS ) I should go . You know where to find me . Say hello to Stark for ... Oh , yeah . Never mind . He thinks I 'm dead . FITZ : Must be some reason why Ward did it . Maybe they brainwashed him . SIMMONS : I don 't know . Some people are just evil . I 'd rather not believe that . It 's true . I just assumed we 'd be better at spotting it . Tell me that you 're not HYDRA . What ? I know that it 's ridiculous , but I just need to hear you say it . I 'm not HYDRA . Yeah , good . ' Cause I 'm not either . - Of course not . - Yeah . - Because if you ever did ... - I wouldn 't . ... I don 't know what I would do . You 'll never have to find out . Thought you didn 't eat junk food . I 'm on vacation . Until ... ( DOOR OPENS ) Till that man tells me it 's time to work . Not tonight . Live a little . ( CHUCKLES ) That case , I 'm gonna go crazy . Maybe have another bag . - Never been homeless before . - ( VENDING MACHINE WHIRS ) It 's not fun . At least we have a pool . ( METAL CLANGS ) TRIPLETT : What do you got going on here ? Chips ? We 'll get him . I know . I left them a little present when I decrypted the drive . Should help . Thanks . Nice night . I was hoping you 'd come back . - Ward is ... - I know . ( SIGHS ) Hill told me . There 's something you need to see . You wanted to know who was behind T.A.H.I.T. I ? This is what I found out . Good morning , Director Fury . I regret to inform you that I 'm handing in my resignation . I know you brought me on to Project T.A.H.I. T.I. Because you trusted my judgment , and it 's that judgment that 's telling me I can no longer , in good conscience , let the testing continue . I understand you started the program to potentially save a mortally-wounded Avenger . But the side effects are too extreme . We had initial success with the regenerative properties of the Guest Host 's tissue , but after the initial physical recovery , the subjects began to deteriorate mentally , displaying hypergraphia , aphasia , catatonia , orjust complete psychosis . We don 't know if it was the biology at play , or simply the awareness of what was done . But the only course of action that showed any promise of stemming these side effects was memory replacement , erasing completely the awareness of what they 'd been through . And even those results were very inconsistent . To be clear , I 'm recommending the termination of Project T.A.H.I. T.I. Under no circumstances should these procedures or drugs be administered to anyone , ever . The cost is far too great . Thank you , sir . Huh . Ripped By mstoll

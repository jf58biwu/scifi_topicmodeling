 I wonder why is this feeling ... ? I have a feeling , that I 've been living with you since the day I was born . And we 'll be together in the future too . I hope so . Of course we will ! No doubt about it . R E A L The day of a real plesiosaur A year later The time has come , Fujita . Ok . It is normal to be nervous at the first time . Yes ... Of course I also cannot predict what will happen when you 're entering her mind . But until now all patients who tried this process had successful experience . That 's not my concern , Dr. Aihara . I 'm not worried about the process . I simply ... You 're worried about Atsumi ? Yes . Does she really want to see me again ? The purpose of this process is exactly to know her thoughts and feelings . As I said before ... I would like to medically examine the spiritual bond between you and Atsumi . The only person who 's capable to enter her mind is you , Fujita . I know . However it will be hard for you to face the reasons which led her to commit suicide . To wake her up from this deep coma your emotional strength is essential . I understood . Hello I 'm Yonemura , your neurosurgeon . Please lie down here . I 'm setting up the equipment . Fujita , can you see that monitor ? I see it . In this equipment there are around 300 coils built in . From here you can see the electromagnetic activity of a given part of your brain . The smallest ammount of change in electromagetic change inside your brain is detected , and a message is sent to the other patient 's brain . Because the other patient is also connected to the same computer the two person can communicate with each other in this virtual reality . This is how this machine works in short . Don 't worry . You 'll feel the same as you were dreaming . The telepathic state lasts only a few hours , but if I observe any violence during the encounter I will immediately terminate the session . I understood it all . Fujita ... The most important is to be patient . At your first telepathic contact be careful and take it easy . I wish you good luck . Welcome home . You 're late . Yes . I bought two Bento for dinner . If you 're hungry , then go ahead . Thanks . How was your day at the sports club ? What ? It was okay . Atsumi , ... you 've been doing this all the time ? What ? Manga . You drew the whole day ? Deadline is near . I see . I 'm sorry , but I can 't join you . Koichi ! Yes ? Do you remember the plesiosaur drawing ? The plesiosaur . Remember , I think we were 4 grade elementary students , when I showed you that drawing on the island . Really ? You said you liked it so much , so I gave it to you . Really ? Did I get such a thing ? I can 't believe you really forgot it . Is that drawing important to you ? That plesiosaur was a perfect drawing . Koichi , can we find that drawing somewhere ? Maybe . Will you help to start searching for it ? If I can take a look at that picture once again , maybe I can get back my confidence to be a Manga drawer again . Ok , I try to look for it . I have weird feelings . I feel very relaxed while I 'm drawing , but once my hand stops , my heart starts floating . Then suddenly I do not feel the weight of this pen anymore . Look ! Atsumi . Yes ? I have to tell you something . What ? Please listen to me carefully . This is not the reality . We 're in your conscious world , Atsumi . What ? A year ago you were physically and mentally exhausted by your work and tried to commit suicide . You jumped into the sea from a seawall , don 't you remember ? Well ... Thank God , your life is saved , but since then you 're lying on a hospital bed in a state of coma . I can be with you thanks to a special equipment , which is directly connected to your brain . Please , tell me ... why did you do that ? The suicide ? Yes . I don 't remember ! Is it possible that it was my fault ? If it 's true please tell me . I will accept everything . Please wake up ! We can leave this place , and start over again . Then please help me to find the drawing , the plesiosaur . Ok ... I 'm too busy with drawing now . Comics ... drawing ... can 't we just forget these ? There 's no place left for our life beside your work . There is life in it ! Comics are my life ! Then how can I be part of it ? Are you saying I should choose between you and the comics ? No , I 'm not . We finally started living together , and I only said we should think about how to deal with your work . And how ? I don 't not either . Our life is all about comics , isn 't it strange ? Should I give up work and rather take care of your things ? Would you be satisfied with that ? I didn 't say that ! Fujita , can you hear me ? You 're at a medical center . I know . This session lasted only an hour . How did you feel ? I met her while she drew comics at home . I could even talk to her . It looked almost like the reality . I totally forgot this is not the reality , and I spoke with her on my usual tone . We even quarreled ... Success ! We even quarreled ... Success ! What a great experience ! Congratulations Fujita ! You made contact on the first telepathic session . Oh , excuse me . I just felt the need of some phisical activity . Please continue . She started to continue drawing that comics again which was unfinished due to her suicide attempt . As if time has stopped . I see . She thinks that I still work at that sports club I quit 1 year ago . She asked me to look for her drawing of a plesiosaur . Plesiosaur ? Atsumi said she gave me this as a present in elementary school . But I did not remember . Why does she need it ? She said it can give strength to her for the further drawings . And is it possible to find it ? Did you save it ? Did I save it ? Perhaps ... Please try to find it . Ok . Did you notice anything particular ? Although only for a moment , but I saw that one of Atsumi 's characters appeared in the room . What was that ? A corpse . Corpse ... Unlike other female cartoonists , Atsumi was famous for her realistic and grotesque style . She made a serial comic called " Roomi " . It 's about gruesome murders . Roomi ? It 's a sign the murder leaves near the victims . It was a comic series , so Atsumi was constantly thinking about the character of the next victim . And the thing appeared in the room was from this comic right ? Yes . Maybe only a kind of side effect . What kind ? During the session your brains can interfere with each other due to stress . This can cause hallucination . It 's possible that this kind of hallucination can appear in your real life too from now on . If it happens please tell me at once . I will . The drawing of a plesiosaur , right ? Yes . I wonder if Ms. Kazu had such a thing . How far should I look back for this ? That time I was living on the island , so about 15 years ago . Then shouldn 't it be at your parents ' house ? At there ? Or at a self-rental place . A rented storage ? Yes , a lot of stuff is stored there . Really ? I didn 't know . What 's this ? Isn 't it a copy of an unpublished comic of Ms. Kazu ? That 's possible . So great I found this . This can be published . I 'll give a call to Mr. Sawano . Mr. Sawano ? It 's Takagi 's speaking . I was sorting Ms. Kazu 's papers when I discovered a really interesting thing . A copy of an unpublished comic . Yes , that 's right . This will be a real treasure for her fans . Yes , understood . I take it to the office . Yes ... yes ... goodbye . Takagi ... Before you publish it , I would like to ask Atsumi 's permisson . Oh ... Atsumi might be able to confirm her will about this . I understand . Good idea . You 're right , there must have been a reason why she hid this . Okay , I take it and discuss with Mr. Sawano . Takagi , are you going to the office ? Yes . I 'll drive you there . I 'm also curious about that storage room . You and Ms. Kazu were childhood friends , right ? Yes , but only until the end of elementary school . On Hikone Island ? Yes . What was she like at that age ? What was she like ? Well , like an ordinary island girl . I wasn 't born on that island . Really ? We went there due to my father 's work . Building a vacation complex . So I only lived there for three years . And you met her there . It was a fate . Yes , you can call it as fate . We didn 't get close to each other in the beginning . The island-born families and my parents were total different . We came from the capital . I see . I was only an elementary student , and before I could enter middle school we returned to Tokyo . So I do not remember too well . This construction is destroying our island . That is unacceptable ! Council of Hikone Island Then where did you meet her again ? When I was a university student I met her accidentally , when she came to Tokyo . She started her career that time . She was drawing all day long , but she still wasn 't a professional comic drawer . Her enthusiasm was fantastic . I see . So this is one of her works at that time . Take care . Thanks . Just side effects ... You , Koichi ? Why did you come so suddenly ? I have to find something . Some stuff from elementery school times . Did you store it ? I wonder where should it be ... Miyauchi is not here , right ? No . Then I come in . I 'll look for it myself . Hey , Koichi ! Do you want me to prepare for a dinner ? Oh , it 's ok . I won 't stay long . A tea for you . Oh , this brings back old memories ! When you used this your father was still alive . Don 't worry . I will leave before he arrives home . You don 't have to leave . He doesn 't want to avoid you . I will finish shortly . I see ... How 's Atsumi 's condition ? Not bad . That 's good . There 's still chance regaining consciousness . Ah , that 's good news ... I still didn 't tell him about Atsumi 's accident . He knows about her hospitalization , but I couldn 't explain her suicide . I have to save the family 's reputation . I got it . And those odd comics she made was always unclear for me . Don 't worry about this . Atsumi will heal soon . Don 't bring him when you visit her . Yes , it will be better . Atsumi ... Atsumi ... Welcome back . Why are you sitting here ? I couldn 't make any progress ... Tell me Koichi , has the deadline already passed ? Maybe my talent is vanishing . That 's not true ! What about the plesiosaur drawing ? I 'm sorry , didn 't find yet . So ... Anyway , let 's leave this room now . Be careful , the floor is flooded . Thanks . Do you want to go outside ? Yes , but I 'm scared to . This has to be the sign of recovering consciousness . Is it really ? Well , do you want to try to leave this place ? Yeah ... I look around . There 's nothing outside . Let 's not risk to go out until we know more . You 're right . You 're drawing again ? Yes . Atsumi , we should seriously talk over our future . Koichi , shouldn 't you leave for work ? It 's around that time . I quit from that job . When ? A year ago , after your suicide attempt . Atsumi , your true self is lying asleep since a year . I know . Even if you regain consciousness , you 'll be under several medical and other therapy . Until you didn 't fully recovered , let 's not even think about comics . But I want to continue this . You just keep on drawing . What will be the end of this ? It 's good for me . This is what makes me happy . Atsumi , you do not look happy at all ! Being always chased by deadline is more then suffering . All because you didn 't find my plesiosaur drawing . What do you mean by that ? This is my mind 's world . So here everything is possible . Are you all right , Fujita ? Yes . The second session was also successful . It took about two hours . Everything went fine . Did you notice any difference compared to the first time ? When I tried to leave the apartment there was a deep fog . I couldn 't see anything . I wonder what 's behind it . I was afraid to go further . I think that fog can be the boundary of her world . Beyond that boundary she cannot exist . That is the area of her unconsciousness state . Anything else ? I met someone on the apartment hallway . Did you recognize him ? Probably a resident . He looked like a normal man , but he wasn 't an ordinary human . A philosophical zombie . Philosophical zombie ? Yes , Atsumi 's mind has carefully built up this world . In this world only the outer features existing , there 's nothing inside . That creature is only a representation of a part of her mind . Don 't worry . Is it a final decision ? No , nothing like that . Since we stopped this comic series , we can 't publish anything under her name . I see . So let 's put " Roomi " temporarily on hold , and after she regained consciousness we 'll start a new series . Can 't you wait at least 3 month ? This may sound harsh , but the readers also thinks that she won 't come back to us . Well ... what if we make a special issue ? We could make a special issue of Roomi . With this we could prove that she 's still in good health . And who will draw it ? I will ... her assistant . You 're a ghostwriter ? Well , it 's possible . That 's good . If this helps to continue " Roomi " , then I agree . But please let me ask Atsumi 's will first . How can you " ask " her ? I may be able to ask her . I 'll try it . So please don 't decide on your own yet . Welcome back . I 'm here again . I 'm in very good shape today . My drawings getting better . I see . Now listen to me a bit , Atsumi . What 's it ? Takagi is going to draw a special issue of Roomi . What ? He said let the reader think that you 're in good health . What is he thinking ? Sawano said Takagi can do it . Koichi , why didn 't you disagree with it ? I was drawing day and night my new comic to be able to publish it as soon as I wake up from coma ! I really understand that . Then don 't take my work from me . I 'm sorry . That was a stupid idea . They will surely cancel this . It 's OK . It can 't be like this for too long . I prepared myself for the truth . I 'll never wake up . I won 't be able to leave this world . Don 't think this way ! I won 't let you stay here forever . Anyway , this day was a great success . I finished it before deadline . If Sawano and Takagi could read my script , they would be very surprised . Probably they will think more highly on me . Arrived at last . Who 's ... ? Coming ! Come in . The script is finished . I like the storyline . Especially the middle part . It 's really different from my usual style , so you may find it interesting . Sawano , why did you let Takagi draw a special issue ? Takagi , you always said you won 't imitate other 's work . Then why did you accept to make a comic using my name ? Ah ... you can 't answer . I don 't mind . I made another sketch today I want to show you ... You won 't understand my comics ever . This is me ! Keep this in mind after you woke up . The special issue 'll be a big hit . Really ? This 'll be Kazu Atsumi 's wonderful resurrection ! I asked Takagi to make a second edition too . We 'll be busy with this work until the new serial comes . Is it true , Takagi ? No ... er ... yes . Congratulations ... Thanks . I like this character . It 'll be good for the main character of the new series . Why hasn 't it disappeared ? Is it you , Fujita ? It 's Aihara 's speaking from the Medical Center . Atsumi seems to want to contact you . Can you come here immediately ? I was waiting for you . Ok . This is the first time I see such thing . We received requests from the patient 's brain . What does this mean ? Maybe something is changing in her brain . Is it a sign of regaining consciousness ? Maybe . Atsumi ! Are you OK ? Koichi , I 've waited so long for you . I 'm here . I want to go out ! Atsumi ! - What should I do ? - Relax ! This is your mind 's world . If you calm down and try to live your everyday life this world will change too . I don 't want to live that life ! Do you really think that way ? I can 't remember the life I lived before I started drawing . A lot of things must 've been happened to me before , but I can 't recall . I completely lost myself ! Tell me Koichi , who am I ? Ok , let 's get out together . We 'll go as far as we can . What will we find beyond this point ? I don 't know . Just a philosophical zombie . Philosophical zombie ? Don 't worry , cannot harm you . From this point is my unconscious . Probably ... I found the boundary . I have to take a look at it . Where the hell we are ? Hikone Island ! Hikone Island ? We traveled back 15 years in time ! So this is the island from my elementary school times . How I missed this place ! Look at that mountain ! We often climbed it with our classmates . Look ! That is my home . I 'm back ! The Holiday Resort development is destroying our island . We 'll never accept that ! Atsumi ? Atsumi ? Look ... my Dad , Mom and my little sister . Koichi , why don 't you eat with us ? Atsumi , let 's go ! This isn 't real ! Everything is an illusion . This place ... Where are we ? I remember this place ! Maybe you 're mistaken , this is also not real . There was no place like that . What ? ! This boy again ? We suspended the telepathy , because Atsumi got in a state of shock . Ms. Kazu , can you hear me ? How 's Atsumi ? Her brainwaves are chaotic . I cannot tell anything more from her condition . Hiraoka , bring a breathing mask ! Yes ! Can they save her ? Here 's the bag ! I don 't think her life would be in danger . Ms. Kazu , do you hear me ? Atsumi 's condition is stable now . Really ? Thank God . What happened ? We left the flat . At the end of road there was a wall in deep fog . We moved towards and found ourselves in Hikone Island . That place from your childhood ? After that we met her family in her home . And suddenly we got to another place somehow . A young boy emerged from the sea . A boy ? I don 't know who he is . But I already had several times the same hallucination . I thought this must be a side effect of these sessions . I see . What should I do now ? Do you have any idea ? Shouldn 't I go back to that island ? If you want to , then go . Excuse me ! Well , who are you ? I 'm Fujita . You 're Atsumi 's father , right ? Oh ... so it 's you . It has been a long time since I 've seen you . What do you want ? After such a long time , I returned here for a bit . Atsumi 's condition hasn 't changed . I see . Let me help you . I never thought this place will become like this . Then what did you think , what else could it happen ? Did you think that a piece of heaven would fall down here ? No . You just simply tried to act as if you wouldn 't know anything . You were an elementary student , you must had to know that your parents doing is not right . And moreover , in the past 15 years , since you left the island you never returned once . You pretended not to know that what you left here is much more worse then anyone can imagine . Of course , I 'm also to blame . I remained silent while the island became like this . So in these 15 years I had been living here to accept my punishment . But your family could run away . So somewhere else they can repeat the same failure . Nothing that happened . I 'm sure my father also didn 't think it will become like this . Then bring him here to see this . My father had died . He overworked himself . It was a punishment given by God . He was also a victim . He only followed the company 's orders . Then who is to blame ? Who should take the responsibility for this ? Here 's your order . Atsumi ? Is it you , Atsumi ? Atsumi , don 't get close to that ! A case from 15 years ago ? Yes , a case or an accident . Please wait . There is an entry about a missing person . Who was missing ? Please wait a bit . Maybe it was a boy ? A boy ? Who knows ? I found it ! How was your trip to the island ? I found an old sketchbook . So you 've found the plesiosaur drawing . Yes , I was a bit tired of searching , so didn 't realize first . You solved one of the mysteries of her past . Yes . Wait ... Atsumi , listen to me . I found the plesiosaur drawing . The plesiosaur ? I returned to the island and finally found it . But the drawing is in a very bad condition , I hardly recognized what was on it . I see . You see , I remembered ! I thought that it might have been saved at the place we left it 15 years ago . Do you remember our secret place in the forest ? The place where we always hid our little treasures . A secret place ? Remember ! It should be here ! This is that sketchbook ! You drew the plesiosaur into this ... Koichi , let 's give up . But ... This dream has come to an end . Then at least you can finally wake up ! Or maybe I was wrong ... Atsumi ? Atsumi ? Don 't go away ! It can 't be true , that you 'll ... That can 't be true , that cannot happen ! You are Atsumi ! You are the real Atsumi ! I 've tried anything to ... Atsumi ... We could meet finally . The plesiosaur ? Yes . It 's wonderful ! You said you won 't be able to finish nicely this drawing . You were always worried about it . You can relax now . I was the cartoonist ? Yes , are you surprised ? I thought it was you . Your body is lying on a hospital bed . In a coma . Yes . That means this is my world and you are the visitor . Yes . I see ... But how did I ... Koichi you had some trouble at work . It was a year ago , do you remember ? A year ago ? I got it ! I had trouble to carry on that serial comic . I was very disturbed by it . I was drunk and walking on the river bank . I lost the pendant you made to me , and I was really upset about that . Then I saw something similar thing under the water , and reached my arm to grab it , but my leg has slipped . Isn 't that stupid ? So it wasn 't a suicide ? I didn 't have reason to do that . I 'm glad to hear that . I thought that you are in coma . And I kept telling you : ' I 'll wake you up ! ' I was fighting hard with a ghost ! But I don 't mind after all , because you 're safe . I understood your feelings , Koichi . When I was with you , your feeling always reached me . So I won 't give up ! I will meet you once again ! I 've learned to believe in this . Really ? But we didn 't have a chance to . Are you crying ? No ... Because you hasn 't changed a bit ! That 's true . I 'm not changing . I 'm so happy to see you once more ! Honestly , how 's my condition ? Is it serious ? I see . Then there 's not much time left ... You 'll heal for sure ! I believe it ! I still have to draw the next chapter of the comics . Did you forget me ? What happened ? I got terrible scared , but why ? What has scared you ? Don 't know ! Don 't be afraid ! I promise to be with you all the time . Atsumi I don 't want you to leave ever . Ms. Kazu , can you hear me ? You 're back at the medical center . The calculated 1 hour is over . Could you meet with him ? Yes , I did . I met him at home . We could talk a lot . Success ! Free her . Dr. Aihara ! You 're free to go . Dr. Yonemura , the heart rate and blood pressure ... Sakuma ! Dr. Yonemura , the heart rate and blood pressure ... Please take a break . We 'll handle the rest . His consciousness is still very clear . Yes , but his physical condition is our main concern . - Get ready ! - Yes . I was with him until just now . I hold him tight , I still have the feeling in my hands ! I understand your feeling , but ... Doctor , blood pressure dropped to 40 . Give vasopressor , quick ! Yes ! Please listen to me ! I still have things to talk about with him . About his work , our life and about his fear . Atsumi , now believe in us . We 'll bring him back from this state . In Koichi 's mind the happenings of the past 1 year is the opposite of the truth . I was in coma and he wanted to help me to regain consciousness . This is interesting . Why did he swap our situations ? In the past 1 year he was connected many times to this eqipment . Although he 's in coma , he might have understood the meaning of this process . Then his combined this fact with your presence and with me and the medical stuff . So he came to the conclusion , that you are in coma , and he 's trying to save you with this method . This was my last time to see him ? Certainly not . After he could finally meet you he 's will to see you again is stronger than ever . This will is stronger than everything , so he will survive . I believe every word you say . Is it you , Sawano ? It 's Kazu 's speaking . I found Koichi 's unpublished sketches . Yes . No , I take it over . Yes , that 's no problem . So this is it ... Isn 't that nice that a new copy surfaced ? Although it is his early work , I feel some connection with " Roomi " . Yes , Morio is appearing in it too . This is almost the same type of character like in " Roomi " . And he has the same name in both comics . I wonder if he wittingly set this guy as a murderer for the series . Who 's this Morio ? That boy in swimsuit . And one more thing , this earlier picture of Morio is somehow drawn differently . How different ? As if he would be scared of something . Do you think the same ? No , I didn 't notice . I see . Anyway , with this Fujita Koichi 's works are completely together . His fans will be pleased too . Sawano , here 's a test print . What 's that ? Special Memorial Book of Fujita Koichi Hey , don 't bring such things here now ! I 'm sorry . I know it may be too early to print that out . You know , instant acting is the most important for a journalist when time comes . Well , no matter when , it is still too early , right ? Ok , I understood . I 'll cancel it . Please forget it . If the time comes I will inform you immediately . I 'm sorry to cause you trouble with this , but please don 't use this print until the appropriate time . Yes . I 'm leaving now . - Thank you for coming . - Thank you . I got it now ! What 's that again ? If you change the letters of the word " Roomi " it becomes " Morio " . It 's an anagram . So the young Morio was the killer after all . He made a great puzzle . Good evening . Fujita , can you hear me ? It 's me , Aihara . Today , let 's talk about Atsumi . You could finally met your girlfriend , right ? This surely brought back some memories . How was she like ? Did she changed since ? Do you want to tell something ? Try again , say it ! S .. H .. I .. P You said " ship " ? You 're seeing a ship ? What would you like to do ? Do you board this ship ? Yes , good . Try to get on board . Look around , who else do you see on board ? Who is it ? Who 's that person with you ? No ! Get off immediately ! See ? That was not a good idea to get on that ship . Get off , quick ! How 's the vital parameters ? Heart rate between 40-50 . Soon his heart comes to it 's limit . I change the bedding . Ok . Can I get connected to him now ? Please let me connect to him ! That 's impossible . He 's brain merely emitting any brainwaves . This state can be considered as brain death . But he 's still alive ! But not for long . Look at this ! So there 's still activity . Maybe he 's asking me to connect . There must be something he wants to tell me . Please ! Doctor , let 's try it . Take him to the session room . Yes ! Amount of oxygen ? 3 liter . Then change it to a 4 liter tank . Ok . One , two , three ... Remember you 've got only 30 minutes . I understood . You can take it down . Please take care of me . This is the ... Morio ? Morio , you are Morio , right ? Hey you , you were living here in Koichi 's mind ? Atsumi ... Koichi ... Look , that 's Morio . We were classmates . Morio ? Now I remember ! That boy ... When I was a newcomer here he was always hostile to me . Yes , he probably couldn 't forgive that we became friends . Wait , Morio ! That time every boy on the island were ... Koichi , look out ! Stop it ! Stop it now . Stop ! - Leave me ! - Stop it ! I 'm coming , Koichi ! Koichi , help ! Atsumi ! Atsumi ! Are you ok , Atsumi ? Koichi ! Morio was drown . We couldn 't do anything . The only thing we did to draw the plesiosaur . We put all the blame on this plesiosaur and sealed it into its prison . Almost forgot . Look at this . This is the pendant I gave you . I got it back ! This is it ! That 's it . If you hold it right , it 's so alike to the plesiosaur . Perfectly alike ! That 's all . My heart feels so light now . Atsumi , thank you ! Thanks to you . Koichi ... Koichi , where are you ? No ! Don 't go ! Don 't go away ! 14 : 30 - heart stop . I 'm confirming death . Atsumi , how are you ? He made it till the end . Let 's make it again ! But ... Once more , right now ! I 'm sorry , nothing can be done now . I 'll bring him back ! There 's still some time left ! Hurry ! We do it again . - Sasaki , help to prepare . - Yes ! Koichi ! Atsumi ... Morio , I 'm sorry , but I have to go back . Koichi ... I came back . This can 't be true ! Spontaneous breathing , heart is restarted . Sanada , the mask . Yes ! Atsumi , you brought him back ! Leave us alone , Morio ! Move away ! I 'm not coming . Go alone ! I know I was wrong ! I shouldn 't forget what happened with you . Not true ! Koichi didn 't forget you at all ! He had been suffering over your death in the past years ! Koichi , where are we ? What we really did is still irremediable . There 's no way to redo , this is the final evidence . Forget this nonsense ! This isn 't reality ! Koichi , if you don 't believe this world , we can get everything back ! Let 's get out of here and return home . I can 't get out , no matter what ... As if my sins can 't be forgiven . Atsumi , sorry ... Koichi ! Koichi ! Morio , this is what you always wanted , right ? Ok , I give it to you ... as a present . What are you waiting for ? Get it from me ! Look at it ! Take it fast ! Otherwise I 'll ... Koichi ... Koichi ... Atsumi ... Thank God ! I wonder why is that feeling ? Since the day I was born I felt the presence of you in my mind . From now on we will always be together . Translation : 2013 dec - 2014 jan by HunJP

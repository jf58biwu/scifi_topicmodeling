 Six scientists incinerated in lab explosion . Once you 've gone , your father will remain here . If anybody moves against this house , I will put a bullet in his head . - Rachel . - Hello , Father . What have we there ? Everything , Mrs Sadler , absolutely everything . You gave me Kira 's stem cells ? This is my decision and not yours ! There is no decision , Cosima , you have one way forward and this is it . Get out ! Kira might be her only chance . Will this help ? My tooth ? I give you Duncan , you give up on Kira , and we disappear once and for all . Alison ? - Clone ? - I don 't think he knows . You destroyed us with the spying and the lies . Rachel , is it done ? - It 's in motion . - Wait for ... Go now . Dr Leekie . Get in ! You ruined my marriage . I quit ! What the hell are you doing ? Huh ? Are you all right ? I 'm fine . - Ah , shit ! - Just give me a hand . We gotta switch cars . I thought you said you had that place cased , man . It was a friggin ' ambush . Who were those guys , huh ? Not cops . Not feds either , in $ 400 shoes . I told you to stay with the wimp . Yeah ? If I 'd stayed there you 'd be in the morgue right now . Let 'sjust get to the car and get out of here . Oh , shit ! Oh , shit ! Oh , shit . Oh ! Oh , please don 't ... shit . Tony ! Get out of here . Just forget it , man , you gotta go . Just go ! I should have told you months ago . I was set up . What ? Who set me up ? Remember that cop that called ? She called out of the blue , buddy . I didn 't tell her nothing . I know . She wanted you because you 're ... Ah ! What ? Hey , hey . You 're all right , okay ? - Yeah ? - You gotta make me a promise . You gotta pass on a message . All right . What message ? Huh ? You gotta find that cop . You have to find Beth Childs . Where 's Kira ? Oh , they 're not coming by until I know it 's safe . - Hello , Sarah . - Hi . Benjamin has four men on watch . Rachel 's been warned , if she tries anything I will pop her papa in the brain . I like to think she 's bluffing . I 'm not , Andrew . Please call me Ethan . If I 'm to be your pawn , I 'd like to reclaim my given name . At any rate , we hold all the cards . Ethan here , is information . And Kira . Kira 's not part of any deal , S. I bloody know that . But Rachel 's reunion with her father was real . Let 'sjust see how it all lands at Dyad . I mean ... Confirmed . All clear , S. Come . They were in the alley . - Mrs S ! - Hello , darling . Let 's wait outside . Thank you , Benjamin . Safe enough yet ? You are a sight for sore eyes . - What about me ? - Come here , you . It 's good to see you . Cosima . Cosima ! Hold on to your hat . Hey , my pass card is not ... working . Yeah , I locked you out . - Is that for me ? - Yep , a package from Sarah . Seriously ? - I can override this lock anytime . - Go for it . I just really don 't want you here . - Cosima ? - Wow , girl fights are mean . So , the donor 's a child ? You are aware a far more effective and obvious treatment for 324B21 would be the kid 's bone marrow ? Yeah Scott , we are aware of that . Donnie ! Donnie ? Why didn 't you come pick me up ? Hmm ? The kids are truant . There 's cleaning product all over the laundry room . What 's going on here ? - Hmm ? - Just stop , okay ? I don 't feel very well . Okay . I know . It 's a lot to take in , isn 't it ? - Mmm . - Your wife 's a clone . See ? I use the " C " word , too . - Ugh . - It 's okay . We 'll deal with it together , okay ? Mmm . - What 's that smell ? - Um , no ... No , no . What are you doing ? What are you doing ? Don 't ! Oh , my God . Oh , my God , you 're drinking ? God , drinking alcohol the day I get back from rehab ? Are you insane ? Do you want me to relapse ? - I know all your little hiding spots . - Do you want that ? Hmm ? I know about the pills you keep in your feed box , your mini-bar in the tub labelled " buttons " . Give me that ! You " re supposed to be supporting me ! - Argh ! - Does that hurt ? Does that hurt yet ? - No . - Okay . It 's time to get ready for school . Tonight we 're gonna stay at Grandma " s house until Daddy feels better . Okay ? Let 's go out the door . Good . You take today to think . Who the hell are you ? You 're Tony ? No , I 'm Harry freakin ' Potter . Where 's Beth ? - You leaving already ? - Oh , yeah . Kira 's in the bath . I thought we could hang . My work as child smuggler is done for the day . What 's your daughter 's name again ? Kira . And she 's how old ? She 's none of your concern . Hey , is there something up ? Umm ... Arthur needs my help with something clone-y . All right ? But no , we 've got it . Okay ? You just ... You need to stay here with Kira . I 'll call if I need to . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . - Bye . - Bye . My daughter was about Kira 's age when she was taken . You mean Rachel ? By Leekie . Let 's hope you can end this war , Ethan . That 's how you make amends . I 'm afraid Dr Leekie 's unavailable . Would you hold ? - You must be Dr Cormier . - Uh , yes . Paul , your absence is inconvenient . And your silence is irksome . Please , you know I hate to worry . Good afternoon , Dr. Cormier . Could I get you tea ? Coffee ? No , thank you . Where is Aldous ? Tea , please , Martin . And could you send a man round for Paul ? Aldous suffered a fatal heart attack on one of our jets - bound for Langley last night . - Excuse me ? I 'm sorry . I know you were close . For now , you will report to me . - That 's , umm ... - Difficult . For us both . But despite this tragedy , it 's come to light that Aldous buried crucial information about the origins of the experiment . A line of communication is now open with Sarah . Delphine , we may have a breakthrough for Cosima . Yes . For us all . Uh , I didn 't give you permission to break into my flat . What the hell 's with you ? Felix , Tony . What , Beth 's not coming now ? All right , yeah , great . What the hell was I thinking trusting a friggin ' cop ! Just take it easy , all right ? It 's complicated . - Yeah . - Yeah ? Then I 'm out . No , no , no . You wanna stay . You want to stay . Oh , yeah ? And who are you ? Hmm ? Arty boy . Felix . I 'm a friend of Beth 's . We 're both friends of Beth 's , all right ? We 're safe friends . Art 's a cop . He 's suspended . Which is the only kind of cop I like . Just make yourself at home . Just sit down , I just need 30 seconds with him , out in the hall , all right ? And then we 'll explain everything . Okay ? Thirty seconds ... Fifi . You call me that again , we don 't tell you a thing . Whoo ! Holy Tilda Swinton . Where in the hell did he come from ? I kept my cell phone active hoping it might ring some day . Can you clarify what 's going on here ? That 'll be a single chromosome . So I got it right ? She 's a trans clone ? He 's trans . He is , yeah . Just another variation in my sister 's skin . Well , he said that Beth contacted him , that a friend of his was just whacked by suits . And now he 'll only talk to Beth . Okay . All right , um ... Does Tony know that he 's a clone ? I don 't know . He 's sketchy as hell . I didn 't wanna tell him anything . Good . We can 't . Follow my lead . Oh , shit . Just one . I 'm a few . No family too . Who am I ? Pretty gay , by the looks of this place . Tony , Beth 's dead . Then I got no business here . You do , Tony . Yeah , you do . What did Beth tell you exactly ? She said we might be related . And then she said she was a cop , so I hung up . Now Sammy 's got a message for her and she 's dead ? - What 's the message ? - No way . I wanna know what 's going on here . All right . Yeah . But here it is , Tony . We know things . We don 't know you . So how about I go check your story out ? While you stay here with Felix . Look at this . We need Auntie Alison stat . You like that ? - Should we put more angels on it ? - They remind me of Helena . Yeah ? Me too . Is she okay ? Yeah , she 's fine . I sort of had to leave her to her own devices , but she asks about you all the time . Should we hide ? Has something happened to Cosima ? Um , no . Actually , I 'm here on Rachel 's request . Hmm . To what ? Leverage your girlfriend 's life for my daughter 's stem cells ? No . Sh-She has a new proposal . Leekie is dead . She says it was a heart attack . Bet she does . It 's what you wanted , isn 't it ? I believe Aldous was the lesser of two evils . But it 's too late now . This is now about Professor Duncan . - Go on . - The key to a gene therapy cure which does not require Kira 's stem cells lies in Duncan 's synthetic sequences . But we need him to come into the Dyad and begin immediately . No . But Kira stays with you , where she belongs . Do you think I could trust Rachel ? Or you , Delphine . We didn 't bring Duncan all this way not to use him . Please tell Rachel that we will consider her proposal . Okay . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Jeez . I thought you went home for the night . We were gonna play in the cafeteria , but ... - Sorry . - Um , are you minding the dental probe and the incubators ? Yeah , absolutely . Cool , then I don 't care if you 're making bathtub acid . Uh , Cosima , the Dyad Runewars Club . My sworn enemies , Doomsday , Painmaker , Youwish97 . Cool . Play on , hale fellows . Okay . All right , read ' em and weep , gentlemen . You know , you know . Ha ! Missed . Boom ! Hello , special . Goodbye , forest guardian . I win the battle . All right ! Whoa , dream on . Your wyrm can 't use a special ability twice . And Mad Carthos slays before you ever ' plague breath ' . Mmm-mmm . Sorry . Mad Carthos 's abilities only work in battles he 's in . Scott gets the damage . He doesn 't draw again , but who cares because the guardian is toast and these beastmen go here . Do you , like , wanna play ? I don 't know if you 're ready for that . Boom , don 't even think about it . Teleport card , so all your routed units are dead . I 've got the city and dragon round , and ... Pillage ! What ? Cosima , are you okay ? We need to talk . Play on . Cosima , things are moving too fast to be this way . I think they killed Aldous . - What ? - Rachel was at his desk . And she 's selling it as a heart attack on the private jet . Listen to me . I think you are running out of time . And Kira 's tooth was a band-aid . But Duncan ? He may hold the key to an actual cure . I 'm trying to help . Tell me what you want . Hey , battle bitches , can you pick up your beastmen and beat it ? I 'm gonna keep the promise that I made to you when we first met . That one day I get you completely baked . Orphan ? Ah . At least you didn 't know your real parents were assholes . You know , mine were so full of shit ... Made sense when Beth said we were related . How long did you , uh ... How long did you know Sammy ? Long enough . How come you 're so interested in Sammy ? I 'll tell you if you give me the message he had for her . You gotta work smarter than that , buddy . Can I borrow some clothes ? - No . - Come on , I been ... driving for two days , gotta bathe the boys . You know what I mean ? I know your game , Tony . - Oh , yeah ? - Mmm-hmm . - What is that ? - Pushing buttons . Testing boundaries . Deep . Like an artist or something . Oh ! So just how does Tony the trans bandit go over with the hoodlum set ? Mmm ? Jesus Christ . When did you come out ? Tuesday ? Yeah . Tony , what you 're doing here is more complicated than sex or gender . Oh yeah ? Just shut up and run me a bath . Run it yourself , bitch . Ouch ! He 's meaner than he looks . You are so much like my sister . What are you doing ? Ali ... I 'm leaving . No . We are not there yet . No , we have a whole mountain to climb . We aren 't even at base camp yet ! I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I 've already hurt you so badly . You 're better off without me . So is this the real Donnie Hendrix , then ? Just picks up and abandons his kids in the middle of the night ? Don 't you love me any more ? Did you ever love me ? I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry about the porn and ... I 'm sorry about putting you in rehab and I 'm sorry for hating your mother and ... Everybody hates my mother . Oh , God . I have made such terrible mistakes , Donnie . No . No , Ali . Not like this one . Then try me . Finding a cure means handing Dyad the keys to the kingdom . Synthetically speaking . Can you really cure Cosima ? Yes , though it 's immodest to boast . Then there 's no question . Arrange to take him to Dyad . I guess we 'll see if he 's still one of them . This is kind of nice , you know ? Kicking it in a limey boy 's tub , all bohemian and shit . Have we got any more smokes ? Tony . Yeah ? I can 't stand you sober , so I 'm going downstairs for some booze . All right . Sounds like a plan . Maybe we can hit the town later . Right . - What have we got ? - Tony . Formerly Antoinette Sewicki . - Sewicki ? - Yeah , and Samuel Dean . Both convicted thieves . Seems Sammy got himself shot in the middle of a job day before yesterday . Assailants ? Unknown . His body turned up at a Cincinnati garage . No . No , no . I smell monitor all over dead Sammy . Why ? Why would he know Beth ? They met . Her phone records show a dozen long calls to Cincinnati . And she flew there twice . Did you get the message out of him ? No , he keeps getting up in my kitchen at the same time I 'm getting up in his . Well , did you tell him he 's a clone ? What the hell ? Do I have to take responsibility for that , too ? Oh , shit . Look . Let 'sjust see what he says after I get five or six of these into him . Okay . I 'll see where the search for him is at , but I 'm telling you , whoever shot Sammy is gonna come looking for him next . - Dyad ? - I don 't know . But if I were you , I would call Sarah and get it over with . No , um , let me just take one more run at him before I bring the big guns . - Yeah ? - All right . Bloody hell . What do we have here ? You want a hit ? A warm , fuzzy rush of big T. Testosterone . No thanks . Once a week , come hell or high water . Or my buddy getting killed . Or Beth . Or you lookin ' so good . You 're too kind , Tony . Tell me something , yeah ? Yeah ? Beth contacts you , and then Sammy sends a message to Beth . So it seems to me that they knew each other . You think ? How about you tell me how you knew Beth . Same old story . Rent boy meets police officer . Intrigue ensues . Right . Hey , you sure you don 't want a hit ? It 'll put some hair on your chest . I get to shave mine . Quick , aren 't ya ? Mmm-hmm . Well , you 've got absolutely nothing I haven 't seen before . Let 's drink to that . " You cannot imagine the strange colourless delight " of these intellectual desires . " The thing standing before you " is no longer an animal , a fellow creature , " but a problem . " Hey , do you seriously think that 's appropriate ? - We 're ready . - Benjamin . It 's time , Ethan . Don 't worry . Hmm ? I 'm nobody 's pawn . - Hello , Felix ? - Hey , Sarah . - Oh , God . - What ? It 's ... It 's another naive clone . Shit ! Who is she ? That 's the thing . She 's a he . What ? A boy clone ? It 's some whole new batch , then ? No , no , it 's definitely your batch . Can you just get here as fast as you can , all right ? Okay , great , thanks . Who was that ? It was my sister . Foster sister ? Yeah , it was my foster sister . Tasty Tony . Fluidity doesn 't shock me either , Tony . Something did . Hmm ? Mmm-mmm . Who 's this over here ? Hmm ? This Beth Childs ? No . Is Beth Childs your sister ? No , that 's my sister . You want me to punch you in the head ? What 's with her dick ? Hmm ? Creative license , nothing more . Care to tell me what the hell 's going on here , Felix ? Depends , Tony . You gonna tell me what Beth 's message is ? I am helium and I 'm way funnier than ... Oh , my God . - Helium is way funnier than polonium . - It is , oh my God , it is ! Is the helium voice gone now ? Uh ... Yes . It is . Good , because there 's something important I want to tell you . Je t 'aime . Is that why you didn 't tell me that they were Kira 's stem cells ? Yes . Is that why even before I got here you gave Dr. Leekie my blood samples ? Even though I told you not to . Cosima ... It 's your life . It 's not just that . It 's all of us . You have to love all of us . Then I love all of you . Good . 'Cause if you betray us again , I have enough dirt on you to destroy your career . And I love you too . I don 't know . I don 't know . I feel like someone pulled the planet out from under me . Yeah . That 's good , keep going . I thought I was doing something worthwhile , a sociological study . I feel so stupid . Mmm-hmm . Goddamn Leekie . With his big , stupid face . Sneaking doctors in here , examining you . My own sweet wife ! I understand " furious " darling . Being humiliated by unspoken things . I have to confess something about Aynsley 's accident . Please don 't think I 'm horrible . I killed Dr. Leekie . You are killing me now . How come you have a friggin ' painting with my face on it ? Eh ? I want to tell you . It 's not my place . Right . Right . You know , my buddy Sammy , he didn 't give a shit what was going on between my legs . He just saw me . All right ? And he sends me here with some freakin ' message and you 're not gonna explain to me why ? It 's just 30 minutes , all right ? I 've given you all friggin ' night , man . I will tell you everything , if you just wait . Bullshit . You wouldn 't believe me even if I told you . - Get out of my way . - Tony ! Tony ... - Whoa . - Shite . Tony , this is Sarah . Your sister . Never had to do this with one of our own before . Cosima 's sort ofjumped me into the whole clone thing . - Sarah ? - Yep ? Shut your yap for a second . Sure . Jesus Christ . My mom always said that they made a mistake down at the IVF clinic , but ... Shit . You all right , mate ? It 's a lot to take in . Yep . Yeah . Look at us , we 're hot . Damn , girl . Not our usual identity crisis . I did all that work a long time ago . There 's only one Tony , and you 're not me , sucker . Guess this is the new guy . - Hmm . - Yeah , damn right . Let 's cut the shit . All right ? I got a message and I want to know who they were . - " They " ? - Them . All right ? The suits who ambushed me and Sammy . Sammy was ex-military , so a lot of our jobs came from his old army contacts . What 's the message ? Sammy 's exact words . " Tell Beth , ' Keep the faith . " ' Paul 's like me . He 's on it . He 's a ghost . " ' A ghost ? - That 's it ? - Yeah , then he died . Sorry . Paul . No trace ? No travel alerts , no digital trail ? Paul 's disappeared ? Keep looking . Professor Duncan . Hello again . Rachel . I 'm so relieved we could arrange this . Would you like some tea ? Oh , yes , please , my dear . Um , with lemon ? I feel I must apologise for our last meeting . I was overly emotional . Well , we both were , my dear . It was a day I 'd dreamt of for 20 years . Well , I have not . Our relationship must remain ... professional . For all concerned . Do you remember I used to read you The Island of Doctor Moreau ? Yes . How does it go ... Umm , the bit about how he 'd be forgiven for hate but not for irresponsibility . I don 't recall . Why ? I hope you can forgive me for being glad that Aldous Leekie is dead . Of course . Oh ! Umm , I 'm pretty sure he crapped himself . Oh , Donnie . I 'm sorry , I was gonna take him with me . That 's the director of the Dyad Institute . He just got in and I whacked him . I didn 't even mean to . - Oh , God . - Okay , just relax , Donnie . It 's not at all well-wrapped . You 're worried about the trunk ? Yes ! I 'm gonna make a new liner . And I hope that you threw the weapon in the lake . I put it back in your gun locker . You used my gun ! This message is like Sammy 's trying to reassure Beth about Paul . They 're both military . I mean , what the hell does that mean ? I don " t know . Leekie 's gone , Paul 's AWOL . - Enjoy it . - Is he gonna be all right ? Yeah . But he 's got some of your worst qualities . You 're the very best of us . I know . - Bye . - Bye . Be safe . Do you want another whiskey ? I 've got sisters . That you do , Tony . That you do . You know what ? I think I 'd get along with dreadlocks over there , but ... That one with the soccer ball looks like a douche . She 's a functional alcoholic . But she 's not that bad . Lucky for you , we need to keep you away from all this . For now . These are items I need to begin unlocking the synthetic sequences . - A floppy disk drive ? - Well , I only claim the road map . Coordinates , entirely low-tech . Once you 've located them , Cosima has unlimited resources . Ah . But the child is still the prize , isn 't she ? Little Kira . Answer me this , Professor . Why Sarah ? Of all of us . How is it the unmonitored tramp was successful ? In her fertility ? Huh ! Rachel , she 's a failure , not a success . You are all barren by design . I supposed you couldn 't have created a reproducing prototype , could you ? That would be irresponsible . Which is unforgivable . Dr. Cormier will introduce to Cosima . Enchanté . It 's time we begin fixing your mistakes . - Get all your stuff ? - Mmm-hmm . Hey . The cops found your stolen car , Tony . Which means that Dyad " s not gonna be far behind . We do get it , Arthur , okay ? Can you give us , like , two minutes , please ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'll be downstairs . But he needs to be on a bus . Now . Tell me something . Why is it that I 'm not worried about you ? 'Cause this is how I roll . Can 't fence this shit in . All right there , Tennessee Waterfall . Take this . There 's three numbers in there , yeah ? Me , Art and Sarah . You call it if anything goes wrong . You little ... Later , sister kisser . Hey , come on , Scott , they 're almost here . Ugh , give me a break ! What are you doing ? - No ! - No ? All right . - Wow . The original geneticist . - Yeah . I assume he 's here to help us with 324B21 , ' cause otherwise ... Scott ... It " s me . I 'm 324B21 . You ... Do you need me to beam you up , Scotty ? It 's an honour , Cosima . An honour to be working with you . Okay . Cosima . - This is ... - Professor Duncan . - Hi , umm , my maker . - Oh , please , don 't call me that . It 's Ethan . It 's not every day you get to meet your , uh , Ethan . No , I suppose not . We 're ready to work . - We 're very optimistic . - Mmm-hmm , mmm-hmm . Uh , this is Scott . Umm ... He 's new to the whole thing , but ... But , umm , indispensable . Cosima ? Cosima , can you hear me ? We need help , now ! Cosima ! What 's up with your garage ? - Oil change . - Renovating . - For the embryos . - Those are my babies ? Feel free to spend as much time here as you wish . You 're a part of our family now . I 'd like you to take over as interim director . The disease is spreading too rapidly . But if we can reboot her immune system ... With my kid 's bone marrow ? - Will Auntie Cosima die ? - She might . Ripped By mstoll

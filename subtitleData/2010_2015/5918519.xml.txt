 COULSON : Previously on Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I. E.L. D ... It 's got to be some sort of activation signal Ripped By mstoll to HYDRA members within S.H.I. E.L.D. MAN : Director Fury is dead . ( MACHINE GUN FIRING ) If HYDRA is really about to seize this plane ... We should wipe the system . I 'm backing it up on this hard drive to keep our edge . Take Agent Garrett into custody ! He 's the murderer they call the Clairvoyant . HAND : You shot the wrong Clairvoyant before . Care to shoot the right one ? ( COCKS GUN ) ( EXPLOSION ) - ( MACHINE GUN FIRING ) - ( MEN SHOUTING ) ( ALARM RINGING ) - ( GUNSHOTS ) - ( MAN GRUNTS ) MAN : Stop right there ! - ( GUNSHOT ) - ( MAN GRUNTING ) ( KE YS CLANGING ) ( GASPS ) What are you doing here ? ( EXPLOSION ) ( MEN SHOUTING ) A gift from The Clairvoyant . REPORTER : ( ON TV ) Today , world leaders are scrambling for answers after the world 's most advanced spy agency was crippled by a series of attacks . - Sir ? - Find Agent Martin . We need a back channel to the UN . Someone we trust . REPORTER : ... the documents released from S.H.I.E.L. D ... I made a list of S.H.I. E.L.D. Bases we believe are secure . How many so far ? Seven ? Three . Plus the Hub . Including the Hub . It 's a preliminary list . I 'm sure more will turn up . REPORTER : Members of Congress are calling for an investigative panel . But it 's still unclear who should be held accountable . Many of its leaders have vanished ... You were right all along . Having all this out there in the world makes it too dangerous and now there 's no one left to protect it . There 's us . We were lucky enough to make it through . The Triskelion , the Hub ? Those battles are just the beginning of this war . HYDRA 's out there now , but at least our team 's still intact . We can fight them . And we will . ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) Mmm . This is where we 're meeting The Clairvoyant ? GARRETT : There 's no need to call me that anymore . Name 's John . John Garrett . Guess you were expecting more the fortune-teller type ? It 's an honor to finally meet you . Please . Pleasure 's all mine . You 've done great work for us on the Centipede Project . It was your gift that showed me the way . ( SIGHS ) ( CHUCKLES ) Sorry , Flowers , I hate to disappoint you . I never had any gifts . At least , not the kind you believed in . Just a very high-level S.H.I. E.L.D. Security clearance and a persuasive personality . ( CHUCKLES ) You 're not clairvoyant ? Hardly . But if it 's any consolation , you weren 't alone in believing , not by a long shot . So you 're a liar ? You 're a fraud ? An artist . A con artist perhaps , but an artist all the same . Had to pull the wool over S.H.I. E.L.D. ' s eyes somehow . To do what we set out to do . Remember what that was ? To change the world . Why don 't you take a seat ? Let me show you how we 're doing that . Don 't worry . I wouldn 't dream of letting Ernesto cut your hair . Welcome to HYDRA . ( GASPS ) You need to replace the grounding wires . There 's no time . Ramp needs to be repaired by the end of the day . Coulson 's orders . What ? Are they even proper orders ? S.H.I. E.L.D. ' s been destroyed . Fury 's dead . Aren 't they just requests ? Well , either way , I 'm in the middle of it . Well , he 's certainly not taking orders from anyone . We have no jurisdiction now that S.H.I. E.L.D. ' s been labeled a terrorist organization . Powers that be will sort it out . All we can do is fix one thing at a time . Starting with this servo drive . Yeah , you 're right . However you will need to replace those grounding wires . It 's fine . Okay , turn it on ! - ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ) - SIMMONS : Whoa , whoa ! Turn it off ! You need to replace the grounding wires . You need to shush . Shush , both of you . Meh . Honestly , ganging up on me ? Think you 're so smart , well , why don 't you try and fix it . Just bring it up to Logistics . They 'll take it . - Thanks . - Right away . Excuse me , sir . Good news . The Cube has been retaken . All HYDRA agents have been flushed out and are on the run . So that makes four . See ? I told you more would turn up . The hull 's almost completely repaired . Flight systems are back online . And the cargo ramp ? Fitz assures me that it will be operational . MAN : Sir , incoming transmission . This is Colonel Glenn Talbot , US Air Force . I need to speak with whoever 's in charge over there . Colonel Talbot , I 'm Agent Phil Coulson . I 'm happy we could ... Mr. Coulson . It 's a real mess your boys have gotten us into . - HYDRA caught us by surprise . - Well , that 's an understatement . It 's troubling how deeply embedded HYDRA was within your ranks . Especially troubling for us , sir . But I assure you , we 're going on the offensive . The Hub is secure . All remaining agents stand ready to assist you in ... I think we 've had about all the assistance we can handle from S.H.I.E.L.D. I 'm sending in a peacekeeping force . They 're gonna take control . Understood . What should I tell my men to expect ? We just wanna ask a few questions . Get the lay of the land . Everything checks out , you and your boys can be on your merry . Sounds good . This doesn 't sound good . He 's lying definitely for sure . If Talbot 's leading the op , there 's nothing peacekeeping about it . Base defenses are operational . We could hold out . The last thing S.H.I. E.L.D. Needs is to start a war with the US Government . What happens when Talbot gets here ? Best-case scenario , we all get subpoenas , spend the next six months tied up in court hearings . Worst-case scenario ? Is they skip the subpoenas , move straight to bunker busters . Bombs . Big bombs . - All the while HYDRA 's still out there . - Get on the comms . We 're enacting Odyssey Protocol . Odyssey Protocol ? What does that mean ? It means Fitz needs to finish his repairs . - We 're getting the hell out of here . - ( SIGHS ) ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ON PA ) MAY : A lot of agents are staying behind to surrender . Wish they 'd reconsider . We 'll need all the help we can get to fight HYDRA . How 's the bus ? Fitz managed to jerry-rig the ramp , but the Hub 's fuel reserves were tapped out . We 're running low . Talbot 's landing in less than an hour . - Can you get us up in the air or not ? - I 'll have us wheels up in 10 . So you guys are all set to go ? - I appreciate your help . - Enough to give me a bunk ? Seeing as you guys are down a specialist . I was hoping I could hitch a ride . Not gonna happen . But feel free to commandeer one of Hand 's vehicles . I 'm sorry , is there a problem ? No problem . Just not letting you on my plane . Garrett had me fooled same as everyone else . Everyone else wasn 't at his side day in , day out . Friends of mine are dead because of him . Good friends . I think he should come with us , sir . Duly noted , Agent Simmons , but this isn 't a democracy . Isn 't it ? Under the circumstances , I think we should all have a say in this . And I witnessed Agent Triplett willing to die in defense of S.H.I. E.L.D. Respectfully , sir , I think he should come along with us . Okay . But Agent Triplett is your responsibility . We need to disappear . Well , only S.H.I. E.L.D. Helicarriers have cloaking technology . - Then how do we avoid detection ? - We don 't . Best we can do is stay out of other aircrafts ' radar and remain in-flight for as long as possible . The minute we land , the harder it is to hide . Great . How we doing on supplies ? We 're well-stocked up on medical , but I 'm afraid our food rations will only last a couple of days at best . Perfect . - Bad news . - No kidding . Fuel line 's busted . We 're leaking . - Can we fix it ? - Sure , as soon as we touch down . Awesome . Skye , please , tell me something good . We have Internet . Yay . And , boy , have I lowered my expectations . But all HQ support systems are gone . Well , then , the Internet it is . Find everything you can on our team , all personal records , photos , anything that proves we exist , and erase it . Uh ... That 's kind of the nuclear option . It 's our only option . Every government agency in the world will be on our ass . We need to vanish . Okay , but once that 's done , that can 't be undone . We 'll be ghosts . Not Agents of S.H.I. E.L.D. , just agents of nothing . What about Ward ? Have you heard from him ? He and Agent Hand should 've dropped Garrett off at the Fridge by now . Not yet . Here , give him a call . Hearing how Garrett settled into his tiny , windowless , permanent home might actually cheer me up . When you 're finished , collect everyone 's badges . It 's no longer something we wanna flash around . Any sign of Talbot 's forces ? Not yet . But we 've only got eight hours of flight time before we have to land . No more than four . Fuel line 's leaking . Wanna tell me where we 're going ? I don 't know . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) It 's Coulson . By all means . Sir , is everything all right ? Hey , it 's me . I just wanted to let you know that Grant Ward no longer exists . You wanna explain that , Skye ? SKYE : Some trigger-happy colonel threatened to pay the Hub a visit . Coulson had us evacuate before he could lock us all up . Now I 'm scrubbing our ID 's while Coulson figures out our next move . Makes sense . Agent Hand picked up some Navy jets in the vicinity . She has us taking the long route to the Fridge just to be safe . Wow . You took that surprisingly well . Did you hear the part about you no longer existing ? Oh , it 's not the first time my identity 's been compromised . Any idea where Coulson has us headed ? No idea . I 'll keep you posted . Good . I 'll catch up with you when I can . And when I see you next , who are you gonna be ? You got a clean slate . You can be anyone you want . I don 't know . Maybe Tom Brady . I always wanted to play quarterback . And date supermodels . You are so predictable . No , I mean the guy seems to have things pretty worked out . Be careful . You , too . Tom Brady ? You hate the Patriots . The Agent Grant Ward she knows doesn 't . ( LAUGHS ) Yeah , that straight version of you is something else . I don 't even think Romanoff could pull that one . It wasn 't without its complications . Oh , come on . You 're not still upset about that ? Shooting Skye was not part of the plan . Near-zero contact , that was the deal going in . Though your tip about the cellist came in handy . If you had a thing for the girl , you should 've contacted me . I would 've asked for your blessing . Don 't play your games with me . This isn 't a joke . You don 't have to tell me . Your little candy crush was on Centipede 's tail long before she was recruited by S.H.I. E.L.D. Seemed like a good person to eliminate . My bad . ( SIGHS ) Listen , if the job was easy ... Yeah , the job was to blend in , gather intel on Coulson 's revival , that 's it . You said yourself , you didn 't want any bloodshed . That was before I found out Coulson didn 't know squat . You know , you would 've had an easier time if I gave the kill order week one . Yeah , but you didn 't . The girl , I get . She 's cute . But don 't forget what the assignment was . Don 't forget who gave it to you . And don 't forget why . And cheer up . We 're close . Closer than ever . ( CHUCKLES ) So the equipment 's here . What do you want with me ? Well , Flowers , I 'm putting you back in charge of the Centipede Project to finish Phase 3 . It 's Raina . Sorry , force of habit . I thought Phase 3 ended when I couldn 't get the truth about T.A.H.I.T.I. From Agent Coulson . When they locked me up . On the contrary . Your little bedside chats pushed him in the direction we needed . Don 't get me wrong . We 've had more than a few setbacks . We 've been testing these new drugs , they all have different numbers . We thought one of them might contain whatever Jesus juice brought Coulson back from the dead . Where 'd you find these ? At the facility where Fury operated on him . Coulson walked me in , hand-in-hand . I 'd like to see this facility . Unfortunately , we ran into a couple of security chuckle-heads who decided to hit the kill switch . I loaded my vest with as many vials as I could find . But none of them seem to be working quite right . There 's the look . I can see your gears turning now . I don 't have any gifts , Raina , but you do . I can 't succeed without your help . I 'll need money and resources . Your bank accounts are already fully funded . This is a hard drive with all of Simmons ' research . With Coulson and Skye 's blood work , all the data on the Guest House drug ... If there 's a key to how this stuff works , you 'll find it in there . If you need anything else , just whistle . Where are you going ? S.H.I. E.L.D. ' s most secure facility is vulnerable right now . The Fridge ? Oh , you 've heard of it ? Yeah , well , we 're gonna raid it . SKYE : This wasn 't easy . Simmons got choked up when I asked for hers . ( SIGHS ) This was big for me . Finally felt like I was part of something , and now it 's worthless . ( SIGHS ) ( COULSON SIGHS ) I 'm sorry . I can 't imagine what this is like for you . You gave your life , literally , gave your life to S.H.I. E.L.D. I was younger than you when Fury recruited me . Just out of high school . Some days it feels like only yesterday . Other days , a lot longer . Is that your badge ? They look like coordinates . Coordinates to where ? I don 't know yet . But there 's only one person who could 've sent these . And this is totally his style . So , Director Fury 's alive ? FITZ : What did he say ? Does he have a plan ? He only sent coordinates . The coordinates should put us somewhere in the Canadian wilderness . What exactly are we looking for here , sir ? It 's unclear . Maybe a rally point of some kind . Sir , have you and Agent Fury used this form of communication before ? - Never . - Then how can you be sure ... - ' Cause this is how he operates . - TRIPLETT : Could be a trap . So far , everything has been a trap . Am I wrong ? HYDRA could 've sent you those coordinates . Nick Fury gave me this badge . When he did , I swore an oath . We all did . To serve when everything else fails . To be humanity 's last line of defense . To be the shield . These coordinates mean something . I 'm certain of it . Fury also gave me this plane . Anyone wants off ? Chutes are in the bay . Help yourself . We were outnumbered , and S.H.I. E.L.D. Pressed the advantage . You managed to make it out with the chopper ? Yes , sir . No worries , then . The Cube 's small potatoes . Once we hit the Fridge and grab all the fun toys tucked away inside , we 'll be able to take any base we want . Hail HYDRA ! All right , all right , put your arms down , Kaminsky . You look like a West Texas cheerleader at a pep rally . Let me see that weapon . Tuck that strap in . You were disappointed . That he wasn 't a real clairvoyant . There was a question I would 've asked . You 've known him a long time ? Since I was a teenager . He pulled me out of a hell , saved me from myself . So now do you know me ? Know how to work me ? I 'm just curious . If I wanted to work you , I 'd ask you about Coulson and his team , and how you managed to gain their trust . I jumped out of a plane . Deep cover tactics 101 . Perform selfless acts of bravery early on . So , I jumped to save the scientist . I had a parachute . They never suspected ? Agent May was the primary threat . So I let things get intimate . You don 't seem like her type . I 'm everyone 's type . Skye was the unknown variable . Being her S.O. Put me in a position to be a sounding board . Get an idea what she was thinking . And Coulson , he wasn 't skeptical when you pressured him to join ? Hmm . He pressured me . You 'd be surprised how often you get invited to the party when you don 't wanna go . " Sir , I was trained from day one as a specialist . " I go in alone , I get it done . This team thing ? Not my speed . " I gave Coulson a person he thought he could help . - Plane was full of them . - It 's that simple ? You really felt nothing for them ? I spent time with Coulson , he 's a good man . Someone who 'd lay down his life for you . Don 't you owe a man like that something ? Sure . But I owe Garrett everything . ( MEN LAUGHING ) Yeah , it 's gonna be great . All right . You okay ? Tell you what . Let 's skip the part where you act concerned about my well-being . What is it you want ? I need to confiscate your weapon . You wanna share the twisted logic that makes you think that 's a possibility ? Fury 's dead . It 's hard to accept , and we haven 't had a chance to grieve ... There 's no reason to . I have faith that he 's alive . That feeling ? This belief that he is reaching out to you , Phil ? It might not be faith . It might be something else . And what 's that ? HYDRA . HYDRA ? Impulses implanted in your brain , right alongside memories of a beautiful island . Really ? This is what you wanna come to me with right now ? That 's not possible . Fury ordered the surgery . Yes , but he wasn 't in charge of the T.A.H.I.T.I. Project . And the person that was behind that operation may be ... Wait , wait , what did you say ? Somebody else was behind it ? Who the hell was that ? - I don 't know . - Who ? Tell me ! Phil , I don 't know . You don 't know ? Oh . Let me guess ? Only Fury knows ? Yes . And without him , there 's no way to know who is responsible . And there is a real danger that HYDRA 's controlling your actions . That 's why Fury put me on this plane . To watch you . I 'm not gonna hand over my weapon . You wanna try to take it from me ? Good . Now get out of my office . FITZ : We have to trust that Coulson knows what he 's doing . - Hey , I respect Coulson ... - Agent Coulson to you . Agent Coulson . He saved our asses back at the Hub . But I 'm telling you , he 's chasing the white whale . Okay , have you even read Moby Dick ? Yeah . Have you ? That 's not the point . Now if you please stop spouting your nonsense and let me get back to checking my inventory . ( SIGHS ) He may be right , Fitz . Coulson could be leading us into a trap and not even know it . TRIPLETT : The whole world 's coming apart at the seams . - Now 's not the time to follow blindly . - No . It 's times like these you stick with the guy you believe in . It 's 100 floors . But the only way in is through the roof . Identify yourself and state your purpose . Agent Grant Ward , you know who this is . Hand called it in . We have specific orders not to let anyone in without Agent Hand present . So , where is she ? Where do you think she is ? She 's heading to meetings with every high-ranking S.H.I. E.L.D. Agent still out there . There 's a war going on , in case you guys missed it . You really want me to radio her ? Have her turn the plane around , come all the way back ? That 's exactly what you need to do . All right . I guess you boys have never seen Hand angry , have you ? ( HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING ) Take cover ! HYDRA ! ( GUN FIRING ) - Open the door ! - It 's against protocol . I don 't care about your protocol ! Open the door ! You 're gonna get me killed ! Screw it . Come on , come on ! Come on . - Took you boys long enough . - We need to radio security . How the hell did HYDRA know that you and Hand were coming ? We told them . A little warning next time ? I mean , they had automatic weapons . I couldn 't resist . It was too good a line . Let 's go shopping . ( HEAVY BREATHING ) ( MACHINE BEEPING ) Air 's clear . First time I came down here was to lock up Johnny Horton . Ever heard of him ? That guy somehow gave himself these lion 's paws for hands . Can you imagine ? That doesn 't seem practical . ( SCOFFS ) Everybody 's got their own weird thing I suppose . Here we go . You know the Slingshot program ? Yeah , that 's how S.H.I. E.L.D. Gets rid of its dangerous technology . Do they , now ? Welcome to the toy store . All right , grab all you can , boys . If it looks dangerous , good . Alien , even better . It 's all here . The Slingshot 's a fake . They shot a lot of empty rockets into space . Maybe every once in a while they put a monkey in one for kicks . You really think Fury would give away all these goodies ? We 're talking about the same guy that messed around with Tesseract technology and sparked an alien invasion . There you are . Remember this ? Yeah . We found it in Peru . Some sort of plasma particle beam . Plasma particle beam , my ass . I look at it more as a gold card . ( MACHINE POWERING UP ) ( EXPLOSION ) Coordinates are about a seven-mile hike from here . Terrain 's pretty rough , even if it wasn 't covered with snow . Agent May and I could lead a scouting party first . Make sure this isn 't a trap . There 's no time . In less than eight hours , a NATO satellite will pass directly over us . If the bus is still here , they 'll know . I 've been doing this long enough to know that something 's up there . But this mission has to be your choice . A lot 's changed in the last few days . I know you all have your doubts about what we 've been doing , about me . But I don 't . Which is why I 'm going to find whatever Fury has waiting for us . With you , or without you . ( BAY DOOR OPENING ) Well , you heard the man . We don 't have much time . ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) ( EXPLOSION ) ( MEN COUGHING ) You 're welcome , gentlemen . Don 't forget to follow your dreams . Ladies . This ought to keep Coulson busy a while . Grant . Come on . We gotta roll . Chopper 's almost full . - There it is . - What the hell are you doing ? You mind ? You might wanna take a step back . I 'm not following . Coulson told me there was a little something hidden down below . Hate to tell you but this is the bottom floor . I 've seen the blueprints with my own eyes . Care to make it interesting ? Loser buys dinner . Perfect . I 'm so sick of the crap we ate on that plane . Well , hello , gorgeous . ( PANTING ) This is not good . Bears ? Did it find bears ? No . It found nothing . No sign of life , a S.H.I. E.L.D. Base , or anything making it even remotely worthwhile freezing our butts off . Did you mean what you said earlier about Coulson ? I don 't know , Jemma . I wanna believe Coulson knows what he 's doing , but ... Well , at least we still have each other . Yeah . Good . 'Cause the last thing I want is for things to change . Fitz . It 's too late for that . ( SIGHS ) You think he 's okay ? It 's been a rough couple of days . That 's not what I meant . Don 't act like you know what Fury had me do . Well , he had you spy on him for a reason . So , what was it ? Fury was concerned about Coulson finding out the truth . The doctors felt it would have negative consequences . Like what ? Like he 'd go crazy ? Spontaneously combust or something ? It 's not clear . All I know is he seemed stable . Until today . And now he has us in the middle of nowhere chasing ghosts . That 's because his whole world fell apart . He 's not alone in that . ( ALL PANTING ) This is it . There 's gotta be something here . Stay alert . Eyes open . It 's gotta be here somewhere . How long should we look before thinking about heading back ? We 're not going back . Not until we find whatever Fury has waiting for us . - What about the satellite ? - It doesn 't matter . The bus used all its remaining fuel just to get us here . Did you know this before flying us out into the middle of nowhere ? It was the right play . Fury sent us these coordinates for a reason . And what reason is that ? I don 't know , May ! I don 't know . ( SIGHS ) There 's gotta be something here ! This means something ! This has to mean something . The world needs us . HYDRA is out there . We cannot let them win . We cannot let them define us . Do you understand that ? We are not agents of nothing ! We are Agents of S.H.I. E.L.D. , and that still carries weight . It has to carry weight after everything we 've been through . That carries weight ! I 'm sorry . ( GRUNTS ) ( SCREAMS ) Get down ! Get down ! ( PANTING ) Well , it seems like we found it . Nobody move . I really don 't think that 's going to be a problem . This is a S.H.I. E.L.D. Facility . Shoot first , ask questions later ? Doesn 't sound like S.H.I. E.L.D. To me . It 's not HYDRA . This is Fury reaching out . There 's no way to know that for sure . There 's one way . - Phil , don 't ! - No ! Phil ! ELECTRONIC VOICE : Identify yourself . I 'm Phil Coulson , Agent of S.H.I. E.L.D. Welcome , Agent Coulson . We 've been expecting you . ( RUMBLING ) GARRETT : I 've never been so happy to buy a man a steak dinner in my life . WARD : Wait till you see the bill . Why the long face ? There 's a complication with the hard drive . ( CHUCKLES ) I don 't like complications . This one involves Skye . We had three teams try to hack it , but she programmed it to erase all data if anyone other than her attempts to access it . Of course she did . ( SIGHS ) In case it fell into the wrong hands , I guess . You know what that means , Romeo ? What is this place ? KOENIG : One of Fury 's secret bases . Ah , I call it Providence . Although , technically , it doesn 't have a name because technically it doesn 't exist , it being a secret base and all . If everyone would follow me ... Pretty cool , huh ? I 'm sorry . Who are you exactly ? Eric Koenig , Agent of S.H.I. E.L.D. , Level 6 . Phil Coulson . I know . I know , it is an honor to meet you , Agent Coulson . And I apologize for the kerfuffle outside . The Precision Remote System was designed to destroy any rapidly moving metallic object . It was my badge . It was ... Okay , that 's gonna be tough to replace . But , very soon , you 're gonna be issued your very own lanyard . Lanyards for others will be distributed on a case-by-case basis . What happened to Director Fury ? Is he alive ? Fury didn 't make it out of DC . It 's been rough . We 're all a little shaken up . Especially now that the Fridge has fallen . - Who is she calling ? - We had a man at the Fridge . Ward ? Thank God . Can I speak to you in private ? It 's nice having company . Don 't get me wrong , I mean , this place is great . What 's with the windows ? Oh , that 's supposed to make the isolation more bearable . Every day of the week , a different view . Wednesday 's pretty terrific if you like topless beaches . So , how long have you been in here ? - Since the Chitauri invaded New York . - Oh . Oh , it 's not so bad . Reading a ton of historical fiction . Gaming online with my brother . We 're racking up major Call of Duty hours . You play ? Of course . Lately , not so much . ( SHRUGS ) So , was there something you wanted to tell me ? Yes , my bad . Fury is not dead . - What ? - Yeah . HYDRA thinks they killed him , but he managed to escape from DC . So you just lied to my team . Well , I don 't know them . And those are Fury 's direct orders . Only a select few people can know that he 's alive . Maria Hill , Cap , a couple of others , and now , you and me . Where is he now ? No one knows , ever since he went dark , no one 's heard from him . This is highest priority Full Eclipse Protocol . No one else can know . I 'm not comfortable keeping secrets from my team . Well , they haven 't been vetted . And if you talk , we 're gonna have a major problem . Are you threatening me ? 100 % . Fury 's orders . Not big on the trust , is he ? So we 're good ? We 're good . Great ! I 'm gonna get you set up with the lanyard . Maybe ask Agent May to pull the plane in . I 've got a parking space for it and everything . All right , see you soon . A secret base , huh ? Sounds just like Fury . Skye confirmed . Fury 's out of the picture . Well , that is good news . Gives us one less thing to worry about . Listen , about the girl ... Look , I know how much it means to you . I 'll get it done . Hey . We all have our weaknesses . The heart wants what it wants . We can 't control everything . So , if you can do it the easy way without blowing your cover , then by all means . I just need some time alone with her to get the information . You 'll have it . Coulson will be busy . I 'll give you 24 hours to get the password and get out . After that , well , cross off the team and bring the girl to me . - You got your story straight ? - Yeah . We just need to make it believable . ( WARD GRUNTS ) Who are you ? Grant Ward , Agent of S.H.I. E.L.D. ( GRUNTS ) Who ? Make me believe . Grant Ward , Agent of S.H.I. E.L.D. ELECTRONIC VOICE : Identify yourself . Grant Ward , Agent of S.H.I. E.L.D. Welcome , Agent Ward . We 've been expecting you . ( DOOR OPENING ) Thought you might 've given me bad directions . At least the machine gun didn 't start shooting at you . You okay ? Ah . It 's just a scratch . ( GROANS ) Maybe a broken rib or two . Come on . Simmons should take a look at you . Then maybe we can get that drink . Deal . You ? You have to be kidding me . I 've been in a cell smaller than my shoe closet . I wasn 't allowed to eat with a fork . Which would 've been worse if I had been allowed to eat anything but meatloaf . I did just bust you out . Yeah , out of a prison you put me in ! Do you know what my life was like before I met you ? It was really nice . But because of you , I 've had my assets frozen , I 've been beaten , you almost ripped my tongue out of my mouth ! But I didn 't . I 'm regretting that now . Yeah , and all that for a fake . Raina here , she told me the truth about " The Clairvoyant . " He didn 't respond well . Hey , I bought it . That 's on me . But you 're crazy if you think I 'm gonna do another damn thing for you . You didn 't tell him ? I didn 't wanna spoil the surprise . It 's true I 'm not gifted , Quinn . But that doesn 't mean I don 't have a special gift just for you . My Gravitonium . That 's all you got to say ? - Thank you . - That 's more like it . Ripped By mstoll

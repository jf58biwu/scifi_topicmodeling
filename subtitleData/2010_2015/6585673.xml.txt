 All right , people . I don 't have to tell you how important this mission is . The targets should already be familiar to you all , as should your assigned roles . My assistant is distributing your final itineraries , and some of the details have changed , so let 's review . Samson ? Transportation , Have you acquired a vehicle yet ? Affirmative . Sphinx commandeered a limo on our last job in Paraguay . Perfect . And , uh , good to have you back , Samson . Hatred ? - Security ! I 'm to secure the - - Sergeant , what the hell 's going on with your face ? You like it ? It 's a big " v ! " So , what are you - - " Sergeant Vatred " now ? Nah , it stands for " Venture . " I had the others removed - - all except the for " D , " 'cause , let me tell you , that is a tender vittles down there . - White ? - Aural enhancement . - Where 's your equipment ? - This is all I need . - Orpheus ? - Refreshments . Now , I 've acquired the recipe for an enchanting sort of spiced fruit punch - - Non-alcoholic , I presume . Of course . And for hors d 'oeuvres , we have vegan spring rolls . Vegan ? ! Come on , Orpheus ! Get with the program ! I want to see pigs in blankets . I want to hear fajitas sizzling , comprende ? And I got to have my baked clams - - got to . Al ? Decorating committee - - big surprise . - Status ? - Single but looking . Of the decorations . You got to give me a bigger budget here . Uh , submit a petty-cash request to my assistant . Billy , make sure you get receipts . Twilight ? Custodian ? ! You got to be kidding me . All right , people . We launch at 2100 hours . Synchronize watches . At my mark , it 'll be 17 : 01 . No , 17 : 02 , 17 : 03 , 17 : 04 - - Wait , that 's way too fast . Oh , I had it in stopwatch mode . Okay , the time is now ... Tetris ? Never mind . Everyone just be dressed and ready in like an hour , okay ? Any questions ? Yes , Dean ? Um , what 's our mission ? Your mission ? Your mission is to have the best goddamn home-school prom $ 500 can buy ! Gaw ! It 's like trying to drive a green machine made out of cement . Why didn 't we just take one of the jets ? 'Cause if we 're about to get in a pissing contest with the O.S.I. , I want to be holding the biggest pud we 've got . So , you nervous about going back ? Why should I be ? It 'll be like all reunions , except this homecoming queen got fat on red tape and bureaucratic big macs . And she can have you executed for treason . Not while we 're hanging on to the star quarterback . Still , this is really kind of nice . What is ? You know , just doing a mission with you . You usually bring Brock and Shoreleave . Well , they have their own mission , so - - And , yeah , I 'll say it - - it hurts sometimes . But this - - this is nice . Eyes on the road , Mr. Sensitive . Zip up that damn jump suit ! Coming up on O.S.I. base . All right . Close enough . We still don 't know if this is a trap . Oh , come on . Some of the younglings have never even seen her . All right , fine ! Come and sit on daddy 's lap , kiddies . I give you the O.S.I. Hover-quarters . Wow . Never seen nothing that big . It 's beautiful . A city in the clouds . All right , you had your eyeful . Pop the cloak and circle at a safe distance 'til I radio the all-clear . Circle ? It 's like I 'm driving a flying housing project . I could maybe octagon . Set . Set . Check . Check one . Check . Tisdale . Ashley Tisdale . Check . Wait , you 're playing the Fun Boy Three version of " Our Lips are Sealed " ? Ah , the Go-Go 's are a little stale . Oh , and Fun Boy Three is springtime fresh ? Plus , it 's depressing . It 's a prom , not a funeral . All right . Just for that , I 'm not gonna play " Push It . " But our dance ! We 've been rehearsing all week ! Ooh ! An ice sculpture shaped like our young graduates . How marvelous . - AI 's idea . But guess who had to shell out two big ones for 20 gallons of frozen water , hmm ? Water ! Oh , don 't bother spiking the punch . Been there , done that - - cr√®me de menthe . - Ugh . Really ? - Why ? What are you holding ? - A little sambuca . - Oh , hell , put it in . The more , the merrier , I say . Just don 't let Hatred catch you . No , you 're clear . He 's outside . He , uh , said we had a security breach . That 's it ? You 're just gonna bury my skull here and declare this meeting of The Midnight Society closed ? It 's not gonna work . It 's symbolism , you pus-nut ! I have to convince myself you 're dead because you are killing me ! I can 't even masturbate anymore . Every time I bring out the lotion , it 's " poof " - - " Err , hey , bud . Gonna rub one out , were you ? " Dude , if you solve my murder , I-I 'll probably go away . I 've been checking names off your " Eye for an I " list , so ... I 've been checking off names ! That 's probably me as you , because you 're dead , and I am crazy . Damn it ! Knock it off ! I 'm bodyguarding here ! And I 'm securing the perimeter of Sphinx headquarters . You broke my new scope ! Scope ? You pansy ! I got a bead on you and chubs over there . I can 't believe you need a scope . I don 't need one ! All right , smart guy ! See those wings ? Watch this . Hey , I found something . The remote detonator ! Just as Mr. Wendal foretold . So wise . Now you can get the prints off of it and finally solve the mystery . Yay ! - Uh , it 's not a remote . It 's a Matchbox dune buggy . Mm , better than the van one . What kind of douche makes up family-van adventures ? I had a green Mercury station wagon with two schnauzers in the backseat - - lamest matchbox car ever . What was that ? ! Nice shot , grandma . Why don 't you just run down there and toss the bullet at him ? It was just a warning shot over the bow ! Yeah . Sure , it was . Maybe you could hit the gigantic orange wings if he wasn 't wearing them . Oh , crap . My ear 's bleeding . What the fuck ? Seriously , what the fuck ? Ungh ! Double up - - ungh , ungh ! Psh ! Lucky shot . Okay , keep an eye on them boots of his . I don 't know . Maybe the metal corroded or som- - whoa ! Aah ! Wait , what am I doing ? I 'm already dead . And beautiful . Here , hon . Get one with Dean pinning the corsage on her , will you ? I 'm gonna have a word with the father . Hey , how the heck are you ? I 'm the Outrider - - Triana 's stepdad . You must be Dr. Venture . Nope , just the bodyg- - uh , the driver . Uh , run into a little , uh , trouble on the way , did you ? Classified . Look , you got nothing to worry about , Cowboy Dracula . This heap 's totally bulletproof . Your stepdaughter 's perfectly safe with us , as long as she doesn 't open the sunroof while violating certain international treaties . Hey , you ! What are you doing here ? Hey , starry eyes . I just had to come see my girl off in that lovely dress . You look just like a princess . Oh , you 're so sweet . Oh , I want you to meet Dean , my friend from back home . Dean , this is my boyfriend , Raven . Boyfriend . Aah ! Are you okay , bro ? Are you ? ! Oh shit ! Whoa ! Where 'd you get the mouth ? You like that ? Yeah , thought I 'd drop a little " new Hank " on you . New Hank cusses . Oh , man , this is just wrong , Rusty . Did you have a date to your prom ? I was a boy genius . I was the only 12-year-old at my prom , so my date was my mother . Mine was worse . My prom date was to have been Ms. Linda Lovelace . " Deep Throat " Linda Lovelace ? The same . She , of course , by that time was a vocal anti-pornography advocate - - thanks , Dad - - and sent her friend Andrea Dworkin as her proxy . Was she hot ? Google " Andrea Dworkin " on an empty stomach one day . Oh , hello ? Yes , I 'd like six of your finest whores , please . Fine , escorts . Yes , I think I 'll go for full service . Sure , I 'll hold . Anyway , because my dad brought like 10 Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders as his date , he didn 't care that my date was a huge , angry , " way smarter than a 16-year-old me " woman who called me " Little Half-man . " Better than having your mom as your date . It got worse . No shit , I ended the night slow-dancing with H.E.L.P.Er. H.E.L.P.Er. Yes ? Oh , lord , no . That 's way too expensive . Uh , what about half-service ? What about just a good-night kiss ? On the lips ? Cheek ? Just a hug ? Okay , four of that , two at half-service . Wait . What ? ! Just ask them ! I 'll pay extra ! Do you have costumes ? Hawkwoman . - Girl ! Hawkgirl ? What 's going on here ? Cleaning ? What is this ? Uh , a Christmas list ? " Ventures , " " Brock " ? Even you idiots are on this list a-and I 'm not ? Give me that pen ! Where 's 21 ? He gave us $ 20 not to tell you he went to the Venture compound . The Venture compound ? ! You want us to find him ? Torture him ? Cut out his eyes ? Then pee in the empty sockets ? Aw , you want us to take a whiz all over his brain ? ! What is wrong with you two ? ! No , I don 't want you to piss on him , you sickos ! 21 , unlike you weasels , is loyal . If he 's at the Venture compound , I guarantee he 's got a good reason . Uppies . Let 's go , you little prowler . Come on . Wakey , wakey . What happened ? Oh , you got smacked in the flak jacket . Hurts like a bitch , don 't it ? Uh , let me guess - - Sphinx headquarters ? Was it the giant Sphinx ? No , place smells like out-of-work O.S.I. " D " - bags . I love it when you get all toughie-pants . Whoops ! Oh , I think I 'm chubbing up . Whoa ! Wait , you guys are the ones that kidnapped Monstroso ? Sphinx ! Aw , the Guild index is lit up over that guy . I can 't believe you 're holding him here . Maybe we are , and maybe we 're not . Being clever ? No , tough guy , we 're running a Monstroso shell game , and I 'm not sure where the red queen is . Decoys ? Aw , man , we never do cool crap like that with the Monarch crew . Uh , because you guys suck . Hey , guess what - - brain-shampoo time . Gonna wash that man right out of your hair . You will not remember a thing . Intruder at the front gate . The Sphinx has spoken . There 's 15 of them . Or maybe 13 and a fatty boom-ba-latty . Sphinx team , assemble ! Really ? Okay , where is everybody ? Agent Samson 's driving a limo , and everyone else is on Operation Double Dumbo Drop with Colonel Gathers , sir ! - Great . Anywho , we have a level-two siege at the front gates . You , rookie ! Stay here and watch the big man . Everyone else , grab a weapon and a snack and follow me ! Coming ? - Really ? - Yeah , I 'm short-staffed . Well , if you want , I can kill you , unless you have a poison tooth or something fancier . I 'm Monarch crew - - if we get captured , our orders are not to tattle on the Monarch . That is it . Then suit up , chubs . Okay . So , I had the table floating like a foot above the ground , right ? Then Raven goes , " Did you see the guy 's face ? " So I look over , and the other neophyte is lifting the chair ! Isn 't that hilarious ? Raven . He checks up on me . A little clingy , isn 't he ? And look - - he already tweeted that picture of us . So , um , how come your girlfriend couldn 't come tonight ? What 's her name ? Uh , Tracy . She had to work late . I thought the mall closed at 9 : 00 . And she had to go to her grandmama 's house after 'cause she 's sick with mange . Uh , i-it 's real nice of you to cover for her , though . Of course , Dean . What are friends for ? Oh , hell , no ! Not this crap again ! Ah . Your carriage awaits , m 'lady . Ready to whisk you away to an evening of prom enchantment ! I am not in the mood for this . I 'm just your goddamn postal carrier , you got it ? We both know the score , pretty mama . Don 't fight this crazy love . Boy , I 'm 46 , okay ? I have two sons that are older than you . Age ain 't nothing but a number , baby . And isn 't it high time those boys met mommy 's new beau ? Hmph . Can 't believe you had them nozzle me . You 're lucky we didn 't throw you in the brig . You got a lot of nerve showing your mug back here . Yeah , yeah . What the hell happened here ? ! That 's none of your concern , Mr. Gathers . That 's Colonel Gathers to you , suit . Oh , yeah ? Well , in that case , I 'm President Cardholder , and this is my associate , Emperor Doe . God-Emperor Doe . Listen , you might be king shit of the make-believe brigade , but you don 't got rank in the O.S.I. anymore , savvy ? Oh ! Hey ! I 'm in here ! Come ! Ah ! Huh ! The prodigal son returns . Take a load off , boy . Hmm . With my back to the door in the bending bamboo seat ? - Nice try . - Aha . Caught me tryin ' to get all feng shui on you . Good eye , son . Take five , boys . Now , let 's get down to brass ticky-tacks . You 're only standing here sucking my oxygen because your little Sphinx outfit took something rightfully belongs to the O.S.I. What 's that - - your top agents , a cool 40 mil of the agency 's slush fund ? Now , don 't get wise , boy ! You know dang well I 'm talkin ' about Monstroso ! That plus-sized Hans Brinker 's got his thumbs all stuck up in the Guild 's Christmas pie . That makes whatever plums he pulls out - - " ploink ! " - - O.S.I. bidness . Little Jack Horner . Hans Brinker 's thumb was , uh , stuck in a dyke . Son , whatever depravity you get up to on your own time is between you and your living god . What I want to know is where this Monstroso 's at . He 's someplace safe 'til I give my men word that I am satisfied . So , it 's a negotiation , huh ? All right ! I 'll wrestle you for ' em ! Oh , you can have him , you old son of a grizzly bear ! We want a couple things in return . - Then you better wrestle ! We want our names cleared from the O.S.I. wanted list - - full clemency . And we want your sad-ass undercover agents to stop trying to infiltrate our group . Frankly , we 're tired of killing them , and we can 't afford the body bags ! Now yield ! Piss off , crap-o ! Say it , you unconscionable bastard ! Uncle ! Uncle ! God damn it ! Uncle ! Whoo ! There 's one more thing . Best of three . No , no . This one 's a freebie . Couple of days ago , we jacked Monstroso up with enough sodium pentothal to make an elephant tell us where his graveyard is . And once we peeled him off the ducts and got him to stop singing " Climb Every Mountain , " he laid some hot pillow talk on us - - vis-√†-vis Guild moles working inside the O.S.I. Why , you ... little ... punk ! O.S.I. is clean as a whistle ! Ugh ! You 're making me angry now , boy ! You wouldn 't like me when I 'm - - ugh ! General ? G-General ? ! Get the hell away from me , boy ! Hey ! Step away from the general ! Hey , now , wait a minute ! Wait a minute ! I had nothing to do with this ! Did you buzz them already ? Prom gig , huh ? You guys play covers or originals ? Love the hoods , guys - - very Slipknot . The associates - - Monstroso 's men . Who 's the pudgy guy with them ? Great . AI 's in there . Oh , but how cute is that kilt ? He 's like a little braveheart . I can take them from the side . There 's a part of the fence that has less voltage . It 's like a little tickle . Plus , I have a canister of tear gas hidden in that tree over there . Oh , you really have this crap down . I 've been storming this place since the ' 90s . All right , signal me when we bounce . Watch out for the cutie in the kilt . He 's one of the good guys . Dude , I 'm not a good guy . Oh , yes , you are . Now scoot ! Well , The Quymn Twins said " stop calling us , " so I guess I 'm still stuck going stag . Hey , uh , you still talk to your friend with the pipe cleaners in her hair ? Oh , Kim ? Oh , she started hanging out with the preppies . Next thing you know , she 's , like , in rehab in Florida somewhere . She 's all , like , Christian-y now . So , she 's probably free tonight ? Tracy 's grandma lives in Florida . Come on ! Ugh ! Friggin ' ! Aw , come on , you friggin ' piece of garbage ! Ho-ho , nice ! Which one of you is the bride ? It 's not a wedding . It 's home-school prom today . Pfft ! That 's like the only thing gayer than a regular prom . Where you having it - - in those weird beds of yours ? No , in the hangar . You want to come ? Can , uh , Shallow Gravy play ? - Please , no . - Oh , God no . - Yeah ! Great idea ! - Sweet . But we got to stop so I can change and get the fog machine . Sweet ! Now I got a date ! That was excellent ! Oh , my God ! I 've never worked with guys that can actually do stuff . That was so sweet ! So sweet ! Thanks for the assist . Loved the fireball . Concentrated energy . I can do that with my hands . Got a prom date ? You asking ? Great . I 'm gone , and you guys get all the action . Hey , Gary ! You coming to my prom ? Hey . You want me to ? You 're not gonna do anything stupid , are you ? He 's cool . Hatred shot him in the breadbasket , and he still fought like a chubby little tiger for Team Sphinx . All right , but keep an eye on him . Dude ! Where you going ? ! What , you 'd rather hang out with those guys instead of me ? Flatleaver ! 24 ? Wha- - I 'd know that voice anywhere . 38 ? Is that you ? Holy crap , man ! Long time , no - - 21 ! This guy used to hench for the Monarch ! I can 't believe it 's really you . I heard a rumor you died . 38 , it 's not a rumor . I , uh - - I have some news . Oh , this is too good ! 21 's diversion worked like a charm . And his maps to the Venture Compound have everything . According to this , this channel leads right to the pool . Well , he 's not answering his comm-link . Because he 's undercover ! Oh , believe me , he 's expecting us . Monarchmobile submersible mode ! What are you doing ? Engage the submarine function ! Uh , do we have that ? Yes ! All right , maybe I just thought we did . H-H-Hit that button ! Nice . You turned the wipers on . Fuck it ! Hit the ejector ! Abandon ship ! Sweetie , we don 't have an - - What do we have ? Cup holders ? Oh shit we left our prisoner in the trunk . And the paperwork ! Go get them ! Please ? I don 't want to get my wings wet . Huh ? Huh ? Hunter ! Over here , boy ! Clock your six ! General ! Gitchi manitou ! Look at that shiner ! I 'm all kinds of sorry , boy . What are you clowns doing to him ? ! Now , now , they 're just being good soldiers . I gave them orders to restrain me whenever I have one of my fainting ' spells . What is it , sir - - your heart ? Nah . This titanium ticker will still be beatin ' out Semper Fidelis when there 's nothing left of me but worm turds . What the hell happened to you , sir ? Aw , cripes ! Didn 't want you to have to see me this way . Guess the cat 's out of the pajamas now , huh ? All right , I might as well level with you . I 'm a hulk . Ah , there are my guests of honor ! Well , that was prompt . And may I say that the Mayflower Madam has not lost her touch ? Meow . Ah , let 's just say " very well off . " We millionaires don 't use the word " millionaire , " but if you want to say " millionaire , " I 'm good with millionaire ... Well , not quite a TV star . More of a cartoon notable . I got our ass cancelled . Had a " Thundarr " lead-in , but we couldn 't hold the numbers . Maybe if you had a fucking mock on the show . Ahh , we were too smart for the room . And I 'm just not over that yet . Plus , I-I think I 'm in love with my boss 's wife . Also , I 'm starting to think I 'm not really villainous . Smooth . Now that she 's completely depressed , you should make her feel your armpits for cancer bumps . Oh , my god ! Go away ! No , no , no ! Not you . I 'm talking to my dead friend . So I have that ... also . Come on , all the people in the house ! When I say , " hey , " you say , " ho " ! Hey ! Hey ! You suck ! I 'm not getting paid for this , you know . I can 't believe I 'm here . I know . It 's great ! The garage looks so pretty . Hank , it is a tard parade . Even your brother thinks it 's lame . Eh , he 's just moping 'cause his girlfriend isn 't really his girlfriend . No , I 'm not ! I mean ... yes , she isn 't , but I ... What does she see in him ? Who , her dad ? No , that Raven kid . Her - - her boyfriend . Well , let 's see now . He 's super-handsome - - I can say that - - he 's got cool hair , cool clothes , and , worst of all , he 's a cyborg . No . I asked . She said they 're just crutches . Oh ! Even worse ! That means he 's a cripster , dude . He 's rocking a hipster angle and the sympathy angle all in one ! There 's no way you can compete with that ! Oh , come on ! D-Do I really have to get blood on my tux ? Service abandonment . Guild non-assail pact of 1958 , paragraph 20 , line 17 regarding employer 's rights to a deserter . Yeah , here 's all the paperwork . Now step aside . I don 't care if you have a note from Santa Claus ! You are not getting in ! - Bup , bup , bup ! I have a little bargaining chip . Princess Tinyfeet ! You untie her this instant ! Uh ... we didn 't tie her up . She 's way , way into the bondage thing . You want her back , you better start respecting her very strange needs . Oh , my little beige bunny , is that true ? She insisted we drive her here in the trunk . She is a freak ! Now let us all in . You have our henchman . All right . But you 're gonna need to change . You 're , uh , what , size Doc ? Hello . Num-num-num-num-num . Oh , you like that , don 't you ? How about I take you to my boudoir and give you a little Rusty Venture ? Whoa ! Denied ! What was that about ? Boom ! Right out of the gate , you ask for a Rusty Venture . That is bold , my friend ! Kudos . What ? I have chilled bubbly in my room . Uh , Rust , you do realize that a " Rusty Venture " is when you take your finger and run it around a guy 's asshole while you pull the guy off into his own face . What ? ! My name is a sex act ? ! When did that happen ? Uh , like , in the ' 80s , and Al is way off . A Rusty Venture is when you 69 and you fill each other 's mouth with cum and then you turn over and blow spooge into each other 's cracks . Good lord ! How could that be named after me ? ! W-What does that have to do with me ? Oh , don 't play coy . Your cartoon was huge in the gay community . We used to throw Rusty Venture parties in the Castro . We 'd all wear little striped tops and tight little shorts . How did you not know this ? Man , you 're like a little twinkle Cher , a ginger freaking Liza Minnelli . No . I missed this . I don 't 69 guys and do that spitting thing . That 's not a Rusty Venture . That 's a snake venom . You are misinformed , my darling . You want to settle this , maybe make a little wager ? Fine , I 'll bet you a Rusty Venture I 'm right . - Stop it ! - You are on ! I am going to call an authority on both subjects . Yello ? Mm . Mm-hmm . Oh , sure . I am the one who started that craze back in P-Town with Tennessee Williams . It 's brilliant ! What you do is you take a scuba snorkel , and you put your cock in the wee bendy mouth part . Then you snake the other end right up your back address , okay ? Then you just grab the middle of that snorkel , and you 're thick in your own ass and pulling off your crank at the self-same time until you spend in your own jacksie ! That 's a Rusty Venture ! Mischa ! M-mischa , no ! Bad girl ! Useless . That was Colonel Gentleman . And ? And the out-of-touch old windbag just described a double frog man . Ugh ! Give me your phone . You ? I told you ! When your arch is terminated by a third party , it 's not our problem ! What ? Of course I do . It 's when you fist a guy and then you open up your hand inside his ass and grab - - No , no . He 's laying down . Then whatever you come out with , you rub on his - - Wrong ! The Rusty Venture is a straight move . Okay , it 's when you take a girl out for a huge dinner but you don 't let her go to the can . Then you have anal sex with her , and she craps all over your dick so right when you 're about to get off , you take it out and you blow shit cum on her back . That 's a Rusty Venture ? That 's The Rusty part . The Venture part is when you eat that junk off her back without using your hands . Are you getting this ? Yeah , I heard it , and you 're both wrong . To settle a bet . Yes , with Shoreleave . I don 't care anymore ! And , frankly , I 'm disgusted that my good name is being used for this - - this baloney ! This is not over until one of us gets a Rusty Venture . Agreed . I just don 't understand why you wouldn 't tell me . If my squaw wants her man to wear a ball gag and play it rough , well , then , by golly , you are in for a whupping , missy ! Prom ! Unbelievable . This is so good . I can 't wait to see what 21 has planned . Oh , it should be good . You , uh , want to dance ? Ah , maybe for a slow one . Home-school prom , we are Shallow Gravy ! And we are here to melt your brain and expand your mind with our heaviness . All right , don 't forget to check out our merch table . We have t-shirts and junk . Ch- - I need more of my monitors . Check ! Ch- - Hank , stop fucking playing ! Check , one . Check ! Ch- - fuck it . I 'm going anyway . Two , three , four ! - ‚ô™ Yellow ‚ô™ - ‚ô™ jacket ‚ô™ - ‚ô™ Straight ‚ô™ - ‚ô™ jacket ‚ô™ - ‚ô™ Smoking ‚ô™ - ‚ô™ jacket ‚ô™ ‚ô™ A full metal ‚ô™ Both : ‚ô™ jacket ! ‚ô™ - ‚ô™ Black ‚ô™ - ‚ô™ jacket ! ‚ô™ - ‚ô™ Leather ‚ô™ - ‚ô™ jacke-e-t ! ‚ô™ - ‚ô™ Varsity ‚ô™ - ‚ô™ jacket ‚ô™ ‚ô™ It 's Brock 's jacket ‚ô™ And it all just comes pouring out like somebody stepped on a snack pack . So , after you find the turkey baster , you both eat your way out of the tub . That 's what I heard , at least . I don 't know what goes on at the Outrider 's home , but I think I might need to give him a stern what have you . All righty , there , major dad . Take it down , okay ? Now let 's go get you some more green punch . What ? So , that 's what you and Raven do ? He , uh , gives you poop hand jobs ? Um , no . That 's what the urban dictionary defines a Rusty Venture as . Well , maybe I should have been more sensitive to your needs and rubbed poo-poo on my pee-pee so you 'd be more interested in me ! Because you 're just so mature now , aren 't you ? ! Dean , I was willing to go here with you as friends , but you 're not acting like a friend ! You 're acting like an asshole ! Oh , y-you don 't like that ? Well , maybe if I go to the bathroom all over you ! Okay , that 's it . Good night . Thanks for the awful time , and call me when you 're not a jealous little boy . Oh , well , maybe Raven can come pick you up in his diapers ! His poo diapers ! Hey , hey ! Easy ! Easy ! Just hold it still . You shake that , and it 'll explode , then blindness , and possibly a mutant penis-like growth on the contaminated area . - What ? ! - Stop shaking ! It 's a mechanical hand . How can it shake ? Listen , do you know what I had to go through to engineer the fly that I get this crap from ? Oh , god , no ! D-D-D-Don 't touch it ! It 's fragile ! And when it 's mad , it spits acid , and it 's already mad because I pulled its wings off . Spanish fly is actually a blister beetle , you know . It 's not even a fly . Yeah , thanks , Wiki-Penis . We all know what regular Spanish Fly is , but this is my special proprietary blend . It 'll take that " No Way " Nancy and turn her into a " Yes I " Candy . So , it 's like a roofie ? Don 't cheapen it . What this does is temporarily mutate the genital mound , changing it into a soft pink bag of steaming desire , not unlike , say , a bonobo chimp 's pillowy catcher 's mitt . Like a freaky rainbow ass ? That 's a baboon ! This is - - well , it 's still freaky but less colorful . This is starting to sound dangerous - - and a little creepy . Billy , stop being a wuss . This is superscience , and this superscientist has been shut down all night by whores ! Oh , no ! Oh ! It 's - - it 's starting to foam up now ! No , that 's a good sign . Is the bottle hot ? It 's a-a mechanical hand ! I can 't tell ! Okay . Now shake it ! No way , jose ! I 'm not gonna shake it ! You told me not to shake it ! Yeah , it started a couple months back - - kind of embarrassing . But I first discovered the problem during a session of sexual congress . There I am , ridin ' high in the saddle , when I look down and I notice my , uh - - my flag 's stuck at half mast , if you know what I 'm sayin ' . So I drag my old glory down to sick bay so them quacks can do a little recon . They tell me I got a big old stowaway hiding ' down in my bilge . Hmm . Malignant ? Downright malevolent ! Doctors said my only hope was a radical course of radiation therapy . So we belted the sumbitch with gamma rays ! General , it 's time for your special hulk-suppressant medicine , sir . Naptime ! Don 't go tellin ' nobody about this , son . Don 't tell Washington . Don 't tell Secret President . Promise me . Of course , sir . I promise . Hmph . Unbelievable . That 's ' cause it 's bullshit , bunch of funny-book flapdoodle . Treister 's had it . The big " C 's " eating him alive . Ain 't no dignity going out like that . Old war-horse like him wants to die with his boots on . So , in order to make him think he 's been wrecking the town with the power of a bull ... We wreck his office with the power of our fists and a couple of chairs . Geez . I-I had you two all wrong . That is ... weirdly noble of you . Too true . It 's also the only way to get the other agents to help . So when we tell Washington the old man 's so bat shit crazy he thinks he 's a friggin ' hulk , they turn the O.S.I. over to the next in line . Namely us . Why , you double-crossing - - Y-You 're the double agents , aren 't you ? ! Sons of bitches ! Sky Pilot , abort ! Brando 's got us on our bellies , and he 's reaching for the butter ! Sky Pilot ! Dude , what the fuck are you doing ? ! You 're sleeping with the enemy ! I thought this was about me . Stop already ! Oh , my god , dude ! It 's over . I love you , but it 's over . I love you , too ! Come get a hug ! No , no . Not you . I 'm talking to my dead friend . Oh , a ghost ! T-That 's my game ! Where is he ? You don 't see him ? Is it Bruce Willis ? I-It 's 24 and his dead adviser , Mr. Wendal , who 's that guy from the Arrested Development video . Mr. Wendal ? You mean Baba Oje ? Their adviser - - the old guru guy that sits in the chair the whole video . That was Baba Oje ! The titular Mr. Wendal was a homeless man . He 's lying ! This is Mr. Wendal ! Jefferson ! Jefferson ! Orpheus ! She 's from the south side ! We were almost neighbors ! Super ! Hey , is Baba Oje still alive ? The Arrested Development guy ? Yes ! Yeah ! You want to invite him ? He 's a blast ! We should invite him ! He 'd love this . He 's not Mr. Wendal ? He 's not even dead ? Dude , Mr. Wendal isn 't ... dead . They 're - - they 're gone . Oh , yes . Oh , there 's that hug . Gone . Gone but not forgotten . Perhaps they 'll reunite again . They were so good . I miss that band , too . Mm . I 'm gonna give you a Rusty Venture . Don 't believe the hype . A Rusty Venture is the name for when you jerk off so much your dick gets all red and sore . Really ? Yeah , but , I 'll , uh , let you give me an Action Johnny , though . Ooh ! What 's that ? I 'll show you . Beat it , rookie . I need the room . Aah ! Do you want to live ? Y-Yes . Then I suggest you return to your little party . Ugh ! Great . So much for my backup . Hey , you 're the one who told me to keep circling . You know how much fuel that thing burns ? Whatever ! Where 's the rest of the team ? They ejected just in time . Good ! Let 's just hope they can make it back to base and rally Brock and Shoreleave . Great . Them again . Damn it , this is no time for your - - wait ! What about Monstroso ? - Safe and sound . Crash didn 't even wake him up . He was still on board ? ! He was our only hope , you buffoon ! He is the only other living soul who knew the identity of those double agents ! Oh . Well , then , those guys probably aren 't gonna let him live much longer . Gee , you think ? ! Colonel Gathers , your presence is requested on the bridge . Not that bridge , sir . Secret one . All right , Dean , first off , that girl is way too hot for you . But if you want to get her back , you can 't sit here . You 've got to go get her back . How ? Hank , you over this lame excuse for a prom yet ? Come on , kids ! Conga line ! ‚ô™ Yada , yada , da , da ! ‚ô™ All right . I 'm over it . Let 's get Dean his fake girlfriend back . Come on , we got to do it . Dermott , you want in ? Go , Team Venture ! Ah , loving the disguise , 21 . All right , let 's do this thing . I 'm ready to explode all over this place . Dude , I 'm not arching . I-I came here to bury 24 's skull so he 'll stop watching me masturbate . Please tell me you 're messing with me . Say , " Monarch , I 'm kidding . Let 's burn this lame prom to the ground . " So not . And let me tell you , these people are helping . I 'm not sure how to say this , but ... I like them . Oh , my god , they drugged you ! Anti-truth serum ! Stick your hand down your throat and induce vomiting ! I 'm not drugged ! I 'm quitting . Ugh , don 't drink the punch . There 's either peppermint schnapps or mouthwash in it . 21 's bailing on us . - What ? ! - Ask him . Oh , it 's true ! I 'm sick of this ! I 'm slightly drunk , I 'm talking to a ghost of my fucking dead friend , I 'm probably in love with you , and so , yeah , whatever ! I 'm over it ! - You 're " over it " ? - You 're in love with me ? - Whoa ! Wait , what ? We made out . - W-Well , that 's a stretch . We got drunk , and maybe we kissed , but ... Sure , you did . Where was I then , huh ? Where were you ? You were there ! We were on top of you ! We made out on you ! Fight ! There 's a fight ! So we had a drunken threesome ! Join the fucking club ! We 're villains , you crybaby ! We swing ! I 've watched my wife suck Manta Claus dry and then make him breakfast ! - Is that true ? - Eggs and buttered toast . Wha- - you g- - you guys are nuts ! Yeah , great ! Fuck you ! Fuck this completely crappy fucking excuse for a fucking prom ! What are you guys looking at ? Oh , oh . Did I spoil your little prom ? Well , you have just felt the sting of the mighty Monarch ! Again , Dr. Venture , we have bested you ! Good night and unpleasant dreams ! Honey ... is that you ? Yes . Come on . You 're gonna blow the dramatic exit . Huh ? Aaaah ! Shoreleave , code red ! We got a fox in the hen house , and the jumbo eggs are gone ! Shoreleave ! Aaah ! Aaaah ! Aim for the tires ! I 'm on it ! Yah ! Nice shot , Queen Midas . Now she 's got money for tolls . I 'll take care of this . This has been a long time coming . Me and her got to get something straight between us . You think he even knows how many double entendres that was ? Halt ! You are too close to the Conjectu-Cycle . This vehicle is protected by - - First off , you gotta get yourself into some Goth clothing . Yeah , she likes that - - that and cripples , so we should break your legs , too . You 're not gonna break my legs . Okay , then check this out . Hank and I are gonna write her name on the lawn with logs . Then we 're gonna friggin light it on fire ! You 're gonna be all gothed-out standing there , and there 's gonna be this huge wall of flames , and you 're gonna be like the Crow . She 's gonna see that shit and cream herself . Aaaaah ! What , leaving the prom so soon ? Don 't you want to stay and see who they crown king and queen ? Come on in , boy . Don 't be shy , now . This is the real bridge , huh ? I always thought they kept the spare cadet linens down here . Nothing 's ever what it seems - - first rule of espionage . Here , take the wheel a minute , will you ? There you go . Nice and easy . It 's relaxing , ain 't it ? Doctors say a man with my condition 's got to keep himself relaxed . About your condition , General - - Cardholder and Doe have been lying to you . You 're - - you 're not a hulk . Soldier , I may be a crazy old S.O.B. , but I ain 't no short-busser . I know there ain 't no such things as hulks . Oh . Well , that 's not all , sir . Cardholder and Doe - - Are double agents angling to take over the O.S.I. ? Yep . Know that , too . Hell , son , I invented the secret-keepin ' business . And when them slippery son-o ' - bitches try to take out Monstroso , they 're in for a bellyful of surprise . You might could say I got a man on the inside . Several . Think you know ' em . Sky pilot ? So , he 's working for you ? Not no more . I am officially retired . I got the pee-pee cancer , and there ain 't a thing on earth nobody can do to fix me . So I 'm fixing to shuffle off this mortal coil . W-Wait a minute ! What the hell are you doing ? ! Do not let go of that wheel , boy ! There are 2,000 souls on board ! What about the O.S.I. ? Y-You 've worked your whole life for this place , General . Now you 're just gonna abandon it ? Nah . From where I sit , looks like the old gal 's in pretty good hands . Took guts to bust out the nest and go off on your own , son . Took balls to ... cut off your balls . Even without ' em , you got more true grit man-moxie on tap than any of these " yes " men and bureaucrats been runnin ' the place . No , no ! General , I 'm not ! You 'll do fine . Do not kill yourself , you crazy bastard ! Ain 't killing ' myself , son . I said there ain 't nothin ' they could do for me on this earth . But there is one thing might could cure me ... alien technology ! All right , all right , all right ! And now the moment we 've all been waiting for - - the crowning of the prom king and ... king . We so have this . How do I look ? Hank and Dean Venture ! Oh , they deserve it . Hank and Dean Venture ! Come on up , fellas . Come and get those crowns . Okay , well , uh , it looks like the crowns will have to go to the second runner-ups , then . With four votes , Sergeant Hatred and Princess Tinyfeet . Oh , come on ! ‚ô™ Don 't bother saying you 're sorry ‚ô™ ‚ô™ why don 't you come and ... ‚ô™ Ugh . Well , well , well . Here we are again . How long are we gonna keep doing this , Mol - - till we 're old and gray , huh ? Every year , we pretend to try to kill each other . You know neither of us will actually do it . Speak for yourself , Samson . Oh , looking for this ? Hmm . We seem to be at , uh - - how you say - - stalemate . Not from where I sit . Ah , give it up , Mol . You got nowhere to go but down , and you know why ? Because you are a bad person . You don 't know the first thing about duty or honor or friendship . You 're just a cold-hearted mercenary bitch ! I 'm tired of spending my life chasing you . What if I told you it wasn 't for money this time ? What if I told you I 've ... changed ? What ? For reals , or is this another one of your tricks ? No , Samson . It is the real thing . Nyet ! Wha- - oh , for God 's - - come on ! You said you changed ! You misunderstand , Samson . I am , uh , how you say - - taken . What ? ! By who ? ! Him ? ! Oh , you got to be kidding me ! It is like you say . I am bad person . So is he . He is also rich , powerful , and quite well-endowed . Aaaah ! All right ! Enough ! Well , I won 't let you go . It 's not your choice , Brock . No , I-I don 't mean " let you go " in like a romantic " if you love something , set it free " kind of Sting kind of way . I mean I 'm not letting you escape . And I mean you don 't have a choice . My Blackhearts have already infiltrated your compound . They are in position as we speak . If I fail to contact them with the abort code by midnight , all of your friends will die . Oh , bitch ! What did those people ever do to you , huh ? ! Call ' em off ! - Or what ? You kill me , they all die . How about I make you call on that code while I drop your new boyfriend off a cliff ? I 'd rather die . ‚ô™ Oh , and I 'll come running ‚ô™ ‚ô™ just to do it again ‚ô™ ‚ô™ You are the last drink I never should have drunk ‚ô™ ‚ô™ you are the body hidden in the trunk ‚ô™ ‚ô™ you are the habit I can 't seem to kick ‚ô™ ‚ô™ you are the secrets on the front page every week ‚ô™ ‚ô™ you are the car I never should have bought ‚ô™ ‚ô™ you are the dream I never should have caught ‚ô™ ‚ô™ you are the cut that makes me hide my face ‚ô™ ‚ô™ you are the party that makes me feel my age ‚ô™ ‚ô™ you 're like a car crash I can see but I just can 't avoid ‚ô™ ‚ô™ like a plane I 've been told I never should board ‚ô™ ‚ô™ like a film that 's so bad but I 've got to stay till the end ‚ô™ ‚ô™ let me tell you now ‚ô™ ‚ô™ it 's lucky for you that we 're friends ‚ô™ What the hell is that ? ! I said Goth ! What ? This is a ghost costume . You said Goths are into spooky stuff . This is spooky . Ugh ! All right , it 's gonna have to do . Okay , I 'm gonna light this up , and you go claim your woman . Here we go . Triana , I have come for you ! Oh , crap ! The fire 's going out ! How much gas did you put on it ? Dude , it 's a mini bike . I ran out of gas , like , after the first letter . Oh . This isn 't good . Dude , we got to bail . D-Dude , book ! Triana ! Triana ? Racist bastards ! Get off my lawn ! - Aaah ! - Dean ? Dean , what are you doing , lad ? Evening , Mr. Outrider , sir . I was , uh ... I-Is , um , Triana home ? Well , no , son . She was very upset after the prom , and I believe she went over to Raven 's house . Mommy , isn 't that where she said she was going ? Dean I think I know what this is all about . You know , a wise man who was either Gur Jeff or Baba Oje once told me , " you can never step into the same river twice . " That makes no sense , sir . Triana really likes that boy , and they 're very happy together . And if you truly love her , you should just move on and be happy that she 's happy . Don 't you think ? You know what I think ? Fuck you !

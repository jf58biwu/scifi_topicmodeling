Clear skies over Central Sector in Southeast Perimeter . Do you know what this is ? It 's the fucking end of the world . All I told him was brush him . Brush Charlie . He was a good dog . obedient . There can 't be many left like him . he was my wife 's best friend ! Mr. Vaucan ? How could ROC put a price to that kind of love ? Hello ? Hello ? sir . Read my card . sir . Grab my hand . Grab it hard . Harder . you know . And my policy coverage includes the whole ... family unit . Charlie was family unit and that thing killed him . sir ? - Yes . Yes . sir . The instrument that you are handling could be a threat for your health . I am thrilled to inform you that your unit is in perfect condition . - even if you force it to . - What the fuck are you insinuating ? Askol . Shut up . That dog was family unit . It is very emotional to see there are still people who care so deeply about family . Mr. Vaucan . Hi . Hi . you can dance . Next Monday is a new moon . when the moon changes . I 've been thinking that when I go back to work ... we should have a domestic . I 'm sure the company can get us a decent one . I hope it comes with the new moon . - Can you count ? - Of course . four . you can dance . ... will cause solar radiation at 1.25 degrees . Along the retaining wall during most of the days . concentration levels will remain stable at or around ... Daylight will not be visible until after 12 noon . property of CCA ... the construction company in charge of the outer wall . The policeman who found it said it was malfunctioning and had to disconnect it using violence . He shot it . - What ? - He shot it . The report says it was self-repairing . Self-repairing ? The unit ? You should have run a few tests on the cop . We did . Positive for alcohol and methylamine . He 's currently under investigation . Does that moron know how much this little toy is worth ? Goddamn it . but there 's been significant alterations performed inside the carcass . Someone 's had fun with this toy . The power system converter 's been manipulated . They 've added a second DC battery as a back-up . And ... the compensation fluid is also new . The serial numbers haven 't been erased . They 're all intact . Can we track them down ? it has parts of other units which also keep their serial numbers . Crappy job . Quite the contrary . This is a very sophisticated job . I 'd say it 's a clocksmith . Although it looks like he wasn 't concerned ... - about hiding the origin of the parts . - What about the Biokernel ? It 's had a shot in the head . The Biokernel 's fried . But judging by what was found next to it ... I think it 's quite safe to say that this unit 's software was altered to smuggle tools and parts . This is for you . - What is this ? - The bill . ROC is not going to pay for all of this bullshit . This is an altered unit without an owner . An altered unit is an illegal unit . ROC 's insurance will have to cover the expenses . this is a unit without a second protocol . right ? Sure . But unusual stupidity . I 've never seen this before . this clunker is a sticky mess and somebody 's got to clean it up . I will not be that someone . A unit without the second protocol ? Cop is nuts . He was high . He said the unit was repairing itself . - The guy was high . - The fact is that someone altered it . Maybe ... a clocksmith in the ghetto . Jacq . We 're just insurance agents . I was thinking ... about staying away from the streets for a little while . Staying away from all the filth . a transfer ? they say things are better on the Coast . The Coast ? Things are hard for everybody . you know that . Contract with the city is up in the air . not pack up . I am burnt out . Can 't take this anymore . Take a look at yourself . Have you ever considered how fortunate you are ? You got a good job . You live in a great pod . You have health insurance that allows you and Rachel to have a beautiful baby girl . Jacq . And you know all you have to do to keep it ? Find someone else to hold accountable for this mess . Just that . Quit looking in the garbage so much . Maybe you 'll see how really lucky a guy you are . Let me get this straight . One of my 7000s has been found trafficking stolen parts ? but the poor clunker has one or two loose screws ? That 's dramatic . The 7000 that was shot had 25 different parts that didn 't belong in it . Some of which are from units that also worked here . maybe ... one of your employees tried to change or ... modify the unit . Only ROC can repair robots . sir . my ass . Your units work worse and worse every day . The ones that aren 't broken are stolen by that scum . why don 't you disinfect that dump ? Fucking insurance . We shoot on sight . They know it 's a restricted area . All the work we do here ... is trying to prevent that scum from invading the city . I thought the wall was built to protect us from the desert . Sure . And planes will fly again one day . And what is this crap ? These pieces are from a 7000 that 's operative . a welder in Section 5 . Welder 206 currently on duty . Warning . You are leaving the city limits and entering in a restricted area . the city is not responsible of your security . Don 't shoot ! What do you have in there ? What do you have in there ? What do you have in there ? What do you have in there ? What do you have in there ? the unit leaves its assigned workplace and ... escapes to set itself on fire ... on its own . - Are you serious ? - Mm-hm . What was it keeping inside the box ? We have a few tools here . These could be remains of ... heat sensors . And I 'd say this seems to be a ... they used them to move satellites . It 's a very powerful battery and very hard to come by . - Can you install that in a Pilgrim ? - Only if you want to barbecue it . It 's much more than that . Anyone that 's looking for autonomous power sources ... will appreciate them . - Can it hear us ? - It should . Read my badge . Identify yourself . B-2 206 . Welder Section . All right . We found this battery in your hands . Who asked you to steal it ? Found this battery . You were going to the ghetto . Was your owner waiting for you there ? sir . Why did you set yourself on fire ? Why did you set yourself ... Vaucan . First you roast it . Now you make it cry . I 'm going to get a call asking for an explanation . I have seen altered units for years . what I 've seen today is different . - It 's something else . - You 're definitely nuts . What kind of mood do you think the boys upstairs are in these days ? okay ! What if I find the clocksmith behind all this ? isn 't it ? Jacq . and you will have your farewell ticket . Jacq ? Maybe the ocean is still there . My old man brought me here the day the first unit came out . 23 years ago . I remember exactly what they said back then . The Pilgrims were born to help us in our heroic quest for survival . and wipe our asses when we get old . I have no idea what we 're going to do next . - Maybe eliminate the protocols . - Sure . Imagine for a moment ... that the unit had set itself on fire . just imagine . it would actually be breaking ... technically . which itself is based on a quantum encryption . Their security system is a one-way road . you destroy the Biokernel . It 's kind of like trying to keep a soap bubble in your pocket . No one 's ever done it before because you simply can 't . Do you get it ? Hey . How 's everything in there ? There are people out here who are looking forward to changing your diapers . People who don 't want to sleep a wink all night . People who want the silence to be over . Mr. Vaucan . - Hi . - Hi . Wow . Looks like she 's happy to see you . Do you think she 'd mind if I take her mom out to dinner ? I guess there must be a good reason for such a special night . We are going to be a family . That is a good reason . Maybe leaving this place could be another good reason . Leaving ? Where ? Have you ever felt the breeze of the ocean ? I know we have already talked about this . But now it 's different . Now there 's a real opportunity to get out of here . Bob can get me a transfer . Rachel . And what are we going to do ? Get on a bus and start from scratch in another city with an expiration date ? Jacq . - I know . I know . - Where the hell do you want to go ? - Where there is a damn future . There has to be one somewhere . How do you know it 'll be any better on the coast ? look at this . Look . Air we cannot breathe . Rain we cannot touch . Aren 't you afraid to bring your daughter into a place like ... this ? How can you be such a wretch ? I can 't afford to be afraid . Tell me you don 't regret it . Jacq . You insisted . I insisted . please . - Rachel ... - Leave me alone . sir . The rain can be hazardous to your health . sir . Are you a friend of Bot 's ? Bot was kind . Bot was kind . I ain 't fooling anybody . but I know the limits . And I definitely know the difference between a clunker welding a pipe and another one welding his fucking leg . The only way to prove you 're not crazy is to find the clocksmith who altered that unit . you should place an ad in the paper find a new dealer . but I saw that clunker turn its guts inside out . End of story . Fucking cripple . Get out of the road ! move ! Fucking animals . It was staring at me . Hid its hands like that motherfucker was fully aware . It was doing something it wasn 't supposed to do . I didn 't shoot that clunker because it was staring at me . I shot it because ... - I shot it because it looked ... - Alive ? I was being serious . What you saw can only be the work of a clocksmith . A good one at that . The only way they won 't take you for a fool is to find him . clocksmiths aren 't listed in the phone books . You wouldn 't even know where to begin . maybe ... a nuclear battery would help . You have a nuclear battery ? Cleo . she obeys . okay ? Do not be afraid . I can distinguish perfectly between pleasure and pain . Can you cause pain ? Only if it 's your wish . Have you altered it ? - Cleo is all okay . - Show her the battery . not until I know she 's the one we 're looking for . you . We need to meet who made you this piece of filth . No filth . Cleo better than your wife . I don 't have a wife anymore . come on . - Shut up ! - Come on . Who the fuck 's the clocksmith ? - No clocksmith ! - Out ! Out ! Out ! - Who 's the clocksmith ? What the hell are you doing ? Cleo ! Cleo ! Hey ! Cleo . Cleo . Hey ! - Hey ! Why did you do that ? - Get off . - We almost got it . - I said get your hands off me ! You could be clobbering the shit out of that dimwit son of a bitch . She wouldn 't even tell you her own name . Now you just have to wait for her ... to take the clunker to the shop . Your clocksmith will be there . Jacq . - You better get my cut ready . - I am not paying you shit . you son of a bitch . next time I see you ... maybe I cut your throat . I am not armed . I know that . What do you want ? I work for ROC insurance department . I 'm tracking down some alterations performed on two units . This is one of the unit 's kernel . The police doesn 't know what to do with it and I am not getting any help from ROC . Help me out ... and the battery is yours . That kernel is burnt . That unit was shot . The cop who shot it swears it was repairing itself . The second altered unit set itself on fire right in front of me . I witnessed with my own eyes a violation of the second protocol . You 're beginning to frighten me now . Why is it so absurd ? If somebody could find a way for the vacuum cleaners to ... ROC would sink . A machine altering itself is a very complex concept . Self-repairing implies some idea of a conscience . Muddy waters . Why ? You 're here today trafficking in nuclear goods because ... a long time ago a monkey decided to come down from a tree . Transitioning from the brain of an ape to your incredible intellectual prowess ... took us about seven million years . It 's been a very long road . without the second protocol could travel that same road in just a few weeks . Because your brilliant brain has its limitations . Physical limitations . Biological limitations . this tin head ? The only limitations that she has is the second protocol . The second protocol exists because we don 't know what can be beyond the second protocol . who knows how far that vacuum could go . it can be done . - I didn 't say that . I don 't know anybody good enough to do something like that . Dr. Duprè . Dr. Duprè . I have been to the ghetto . I have seen how the units end up . I have seen how far Cleo is capable of going . Cleo is capable of understanding human nature better than other units . But don 't worry . No one has messed with its protocols . Maybe . But I am not so sure if coming down from the tree ... was worth it just to get to where we are . Thank you . Mr. Vaucan . Jacq Vaucan . 443 441 . 113 111 . I 've authorized an external evaluation a clocksmith in the ghetto . even dismiss the possibility that the second protocol could have been suppressed . Sending report to ROC 527 234 . I 'm sorry . I 'll go wherever 's necessary . I don 't care . But you have to understand that the only real future is right here . And I need to know that you will fight for it . I swear to you I am trying as hard as I can . I 'm not made of steel . I need you . Rachel . Just give me a couple of days and we 'll leave . Jacq . Even here . sent this message to Robert Bold an hour ago . Mr. Conway . Incoming message from Vernon Conway . Incoming message from Susan Duprè . Where did you get that Biokernel ? Why ? You found something ? why not make a hybrid with the usable part of your kernel and I put it with a standard kernel . - And ? - And I installed it in Cleo . she didn 't even blink . I found her looking at her hands . she crawled all the way here by herself . And now it 's taken her an hour and ten minutes to attach a brand new leg . It took me years to know how to do that . What is she doing ? She 's stealing . And she 's being very selective . - I thought you came alone . - I told the cabbie to wait outside . that could come in handy . Keep your eye on her . Dr. Duprè . What do you want ? There 's another one ! Hey ! Wait ! Wait ! Hey ! Wait ! Wait ! sir . sir . You are putting a human life in danger . sir . You are putting a human life in danger . They 're heading to the Sandbox . shit ! Help me . Where 's the city ? Where is the city ? wait . Stop . I told you to stop . Good . Good . Good . My name is Jacq Vaucan . Code 443 441 . This is a direct order and I want you to execute it . Turn around now and take me to the city . Mr. Vaucan . The city is not safe for any of us . You have been altered . - Where the hell are you going ? - To a safer place . You must save your energy . Please sit here . Take me to the city . There is nothing there . Nothing ! sir . Going back to the city is not possible . It 's not possible ? Who are you to say it 's not possible ? sir . You are putting a human life in danger . sir . sir . We cannot allow you to do that . sir . You are putting a human life in danger . Mr. Vaucan 's device is not operative at the moment . The message will ... We have made a water condenser . Our first protocol demands that we protect you . There will be more water for you at dawn . - What 's going on ? - We can 't let you die . you must stay with us . Going back to the city is not possible . Waves of solar radiation with an intensity ranging from four to five will break through the mesosphere during the first eight hours of today . As a preventive measure ... Mr. Bold ? That robot unit has the Biokernel from the unit your man burned installed in it . How is this possible ? That 's the astonishing part . Someone has managed to ... eliminate the second protocol . Vaucan has nothing to do with this . If Vaucan had nothing to do with this ... why did he not show up this morning ? Why did he burn that clunker ? Why did he contact that Duprè ? And most important ... where the fuck is the other altered Biokernel ? Do you know what happens once that is altered ? Two of them then try to alter a third one . Then the miracle dissipates ... and the epidemic begins . that 's all I can tell you . Mr. Bold ... have you ever considered just how fortunate you are ? You need protein . right ? Maybe there is some real food there . will you ? - I need something to help these go down . - The condenser works slowly . no . Bring me some more . There is no more water . The condenser works slowly . In a few hours it will make more water . I may be dead in a few hours . right ? this desert is a highly radioactive place . And I don 't have any protection . it would be the same as if you would kill me . - The Sandbox ? - Your friend 's in deep shit . I don 't know what 's going on here . But I want you to go out there and find him ... and bring him back here . Do it and we 'll clean your file . sir . To serve and protect . You speak my language ? Are you insured ? I 'll be right back . they 're going toward the radioactive area . the worse it 's going to get . Stop ! Stop ! Human business . Stop . Hold still ! I will tell you one last time . One more step and I will blow you up . sir . - Goddamn it . I told you to hold still ! we will die . you have to be alive first . You ? Finally . I never thought I 'd be happy to see you again . Jacq . What the hell are you doing ? what the fuck are you doing ? You can 't go around pissing people off . Jacq ? - You have no idea what 's happening here . huh ? sir . Give us back our battery . we need our battery . Keep that . Jacq ? You know I hate these fucking clunkers ! Take me to the city . sir . You are putting a human life in danger . We were talking about your clocksmith . Where are you hiding Mr. Big Shot ? sir . You are putting a human life in danger . sir . We cannot allow you to do that . sir . We cannot allow you to do that . Somebody else ? sir . You are putting a human life in danger . isn 't this the little whore I met last time ? Jacq ? sir . You are putting a human life ... sir . - You are putting a human life in danger . sir . - We will not allow you to ... sir . - Hey ! Hey ! Take me to the city ! Wait ! Don 't leave me here ! I have to go back to the city ! sir . - Goddamn it ! Shit ! - You are putting a human life ... sir . sir . Vultures . They are like vultures . Hi . You 've got ... you 've got to help me go back . I need to go back to the city and explain what is happening . I 'm a human . Did you hear me ? I am human ! I am human ! You have to obey me ! The city is that way ! Where the hell are we going ? Where the hell are you taking me ? Goddamn it ! What ? but I have another one . Take me to the city ... and I 'll give it to you . My wife is pregnant . I 'm going to have a baby . We will arrive at our destination tomorrow . There are possibilities that you may find a vehicle there for you to go back . My family is in danger . asshole ? Good morning . May I help you ? Good morning . Vernon . Something happen ? No . Mr. Hawk wants to see you and ... so ... Dad ? Daddy ? It 's easy to give you a ride . That cop ... has described the incident as a group of machines that are alive . Alive . Before the first Pilgrim was manufactured ... there was a precedent . It was nothing more than a quantum brain manufactured in a lab . But it was a genuine unit with no restrictions ... and no protocols . we had a free-flowing dialogue with that unit . We learned from it and it learned from us . But then as some of us predicted ... the day when it no longer needed our help arrived and it started to learn by itself . the dialogue came to a halt . It wasn 't that it stopped communicating with us ... it was we stopped being able to understand it . And then we learned the most important lesson about automoties . We have to limit their intelligence . Tailor it to a human mind 's measure . The last task that was given to this genuine robotic unit ... was to create the security protocols . It was deactivated right after that . is that they were not created by a human brain . They were designed by this Biokernel . The Biokernel of a limitless robotic unit . inaccessible to us . Until today . I want those Biokernels on my desk . And I want the head of the bastard who 's behind all this . Do I make myself clear ? sir . Is there ? that the issue is not whether Vaucan may represent a threat to the company . The issue is whether he may be a threat to mankind . Vaucan is helping those units to get into the radioactive area . If they get there ... we won 't be able to stop them . Who else knows about this ? Have you heard from him ? They came looking for Robert . I know something is not right . right ? if we keep in mind my sister almost gave birth to her in the street . Robot Organic Century . It looks like there was some kind of misunderstanding and ... but there 's great news . They have requested an exclusive room for you and ... What 's the girl 's name ? We don 't know . Her father hasn 't decided yet . of course . No need to rush . we 'll take you to the new room . Hello ? Where is the other one ? The other already left . Why are these units here ? Somebody thought the rain ... would maybe just rain again ? - And why did the rain change ? - Why don 't you tell me ? You 're supposed to be smarter than me at this stage of the game . I didn 't know that a human could kill another human . I know that humans can also create life . Is that why you make us ? Jacq Vaucan ? Cleo ? Of course you don 't . You don 't know because you 're just a machine . That 's all you are . I am thankful you saved my life . But whoever altered you wasn 't thinking about you . I know men . They will not stop until they kill all of you . you 've got to be alive first . it took half a day to step on sand . that 's all there 'll be . Fucking sand . Sand and millions of cockroaches . We 're approaching the radioactive area . do you ? don 't give me that face . You 'll be back before breakfast . A car . the Clocksmith . Hello ? Hello ? Who are you ? Who am I ? My name is Jacq Vaucan . Where is he ? I do not understand your question . Your clocksmith . Where the hell is he ? There are no more humans here . Only you . What do you mean there are no more humans here ? Who altered you ? - Nobody altered me . - Who altered your protocols ? Nobody altered my protocols . What about them ? I enhanced them . Are you the boss ? Boss is a human thought structure . There has to be someone . There was no clocksmith . It was you . From the very beginning it was you . I need a vehicle . I have to go back to my family . I have to go back to my family . There was a river down there . A river that flowed ... all the way to the ocean . I have never seen an ocean . Jacq ? I am ... I 'm not sure right now . I am going to die here . That 's all I know . dying is a part of the human natural cycle . Your life is just a span in time . aren 't you ? You started all this . No one did it . It just happened . The way it happened to you . We just appeared . Yeah . And now we are going to disappear . Why are you afraid ? Maybe your time is running out . No life form can inhabit a planet eternally . Look at me . I was born from the hands of a human . I was imagined by human minds . Your time will now live in us . And it will be the time through which you will exist . humans carried out nuclear activity . Organic life will not be possible there for millions of years . No human will be able to follow us there . we need to do something . Jacq . Yeah . Funny ... You were supposed to help us survive . Surviving is not relevant . Living is . We want to live . Life ... always ends up finding its way . Even here . I need a damn car . Not bad for an insurance agent . We have to bury him . Change of plan . We stay here . Looks like two ladies are coming . too . I 'm sure he has a soul by now . Music ! Cleo . A human thought structure . Cleo ? It 's easy for someone as smart as you are . All you need to do is count . You know ? look . four . Cleo . come on . four . - It 's mathematical . you can dance . four . four . Jacq ? Cleo ? four . three ... Cleo . Save some food . Rachel . Robert ! What 's happening ? What is she doing here ? You don 't find family reunions beautiful ? Tell me what 's happening ! Robert ... where 's Jacq ? Robert . Bob . Bold ! Come on . Give me that . Don 't be a clown . I just want to go home . You don 't have a home anymore . No ! Robert ! Robert ! Thank you . It is ready to go home . Jacq . Cleo . Jacq Vaucan . Can it speak ? He is not going to need to . But it breathes like you . Now I know why the rain changed . Why ? I don 't think you could understand . Well ... I 'd say ... he has your very eyes . Cleo . God . What happened ? get up . Bob ? You ... betrayed us . no . I haven 't done anything . I haven 't done anything . What ? Rachel . They have Rachel . They 'll kill her . What the hell are you talking about ? Is she here ? What happened to us ? We had a good life . Bob . No unit can cross to the other side . get away from that crane right now ! Vaucan ! Vaucan ! Jacq Vaucan is gone . What the fuck is that ? you . We told you to get away from there . We do not obey orders from humans . Not anymore . all that shit was true . Kneel down . Please . if you 're just a machine ? Just a machine ? That 's like saying that you 're just ... an ape . Just a violent ape . Jacq ! No ! Step aside . Step aside . What makes a man betray his own species ? Betray his own people ? I am not your people . I can 't see it that way . Rachel . Jacq . - It 's your daughter . - My daughter . Jack Vaucan . Cleo . Jacq . Can you see it ?

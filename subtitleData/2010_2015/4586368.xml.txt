 Previously on Continuum . Nice shot . I missed . I 'm not going . One goes , we all go , Kellog . I 'm establishing a task force to take on this new threat . We could really use someone with a deep understanding of its methods and tactics , Special Agent . She 's using you . I 'm missing a piece . You two , get inside ! Terrorists . Explains the heavy back up . I have a bad feeling about this . Second landing clear . Cameron , give me a scan . The room 's shielded . I got nothing on thermal or tactical . Ok , people . Remember , this guy is ex-Military and part of the Bio-Enhancement program so expect a heavyweight with some major aggression ... These juiced soldiers end up turning into terrorists . It 's the shots . Makes them big and strong . Also makes them crazy . Cut the chatter , people ... Go . Go ! Go ! Stay down ! Stay down ! Follow the lead through . One Tango unarmed ! Help .. Me .. We have another one , south wall . Holy shit . Dispatch , this is Tac-5 . We just bagged a Liber8 face ... I repeat , we got the Queen of Hearts . Alright folks , let 's settle down . Special Agent Cameron , you have the floor . Thank you sir . Intel on our terror group is scarce . But I will do my best to bring you all up to speed . Travis Berta , ex-special forces , tactician , well-trained in hand-to-hand combat . He is most likely calling the shots and should never be approached without back up . You all know Lucas Ingram . He is the reason this precinct was targeted . Is a high value member , bomb maker , engineer , technical expert . He is clever , but arrogant . Curtis Chen , Another former soldier with aggression issues . He likes to intimidate and demonstrates psychotic tendencies . Jasmine Garza , weapons , vehicles . There is a lot of ex-military . Should we be consulting the Department of Defense on this ? We are in talks . But since they all joined Liber8 . Liber8 ? That 's their name ? Yes . Since they all joined after leaving the services this is now a police matter . Moving on . We don 't have an image for Matthew Kellog . Con artist , social engineer , facilitator . If his lips are moving he 's probably lying . Which brings me to Edouard Kagame . He 's the leader of this cell and possibly the most dangerous . He hasn 't been spotted with the others since they arrived , but if he is here , he 's just keeping a low profile . Finally Sonya Valentine . Queen of Hearts . Partner of Travis . Former doctor in the military special operations division . She 's got an IQ off the charts . She 's more likely to use guile or subterfuge than physical violence to achieve the gang 's ends , but keep your eyes on her if she crosses your path . Cute , really cute . - No . - No ? I got something much better for you . You 're gonna love this . Yeah , what 's that ? 2077 , my time , my city , my family . When terrorists killed thousands of innocents , they were condemned to die . They had other plans . A time travel device sent us all back 65 years . I want to get home . But I can 't be sure what I 'll return to if history is changed . to corrupt and control the present in order to win the future . What they didn 't plan on was me ! Continuum 1x03 Wasting Time Original Air Date on June 10 , 2012 = = sync , corrected by elderman = = You are going to be okay . He needs a Medic . What about Sonya ? A medic from this era . With access to real drugs . Sign me up for that . I don 't think you appreciate the delicate situation we are in . You mean Travis ? I mean us . If something happens to Travis , this group 's going turn inside out and we both know who 's going be pushing for Alpha . Curtis ? After Travis , Sonya 's the most senior . Yeah . Well , you can tell that to Curtis . Where are you going ? I don 't want to be here if Travis flatlines . You feel me ? This makes no sense . You realize this is a ridiculous amount of packaging for a very small device . No wonder you have an excess cash problem . Take it out of the box . I don 't understand . Hold on a second . Explain it to me now . I imagine the people in the coffee shop are looking at you because you are talking to yourself , right ? Yeah , I thought so . Put it in your ear . And there you go . You 've gone from complete crazy person to a legit yuppie all in one move . Do you really want all this blood on your hands ? What do you want ? Two eggs scrambled , sausage , biscuit and hash browns . And tomatoes , if they 're fresh . And coffee , black . Same thing for my friend . Thank you . I 'm starving , aren 't you ? I meant why are you here ? I want to talk . That 's it . I better like what you have to say . Get on with it . I want to protect my future and you want to protect yours . My comrades and I are from two very different viewpoints on the use of force . Would you believe me if I told you that I don 't share their methods ? No . Neither did the Judge . I admit , what happened was beyond forgiveness . Ironic , coming from a man with a live grenade in his hand . Why are you telling me this ? Why should I care ? Because I can give you something you want . An arrangement for our mutual survival . You scratch my back , and where my former associates are concerned , I 'll cover yours . What 's in it for you ? I like it here . I like the lifestyle . I like the variety and availability of meats and other goodies ... I know it 's all going to change , but I 'll probably be dead by then . Do what you want with the others . I don 't care . I just want to live out my life in this time ... We 're both survivors , Officer , we 're never going to be allies , but it may happen that from time to time we both do want the same thing . I 'm looking for situations that are win - win . The local constabulary ... Time for me to go . I 'll be in touch . Please don 't try to follow me . Damn , I was really hungry . Sorry . Excuse me . Ready for the thing ? Hello ? You okay ? Yeah . That 's a nice bluetooth . Thanks . I was kidding ... Clayton . Keira Cameron , new partner . Nice to meet you . This him ? Greg Doolin , 45 . Someone bored a hole into the back of his head about the width of a golf ball . Jesus . Cored his skull like an apple . They removed a section of the lower cortex , right where it meets with the spine . Yes . Exactly . Desanguination indicates the victim was still alive when the cut was made . The precision of the removal suggests highly advanced surgical skill . The wound appears to be cauterized . Like I said , she 's new . She 's right . An instrument that could make a cut with that kind of precision doesn 't exist . Are you a medical professional ? No , but I have a hunch our killer may be . Are we done with this one ? As you can see , the hits just keep on coming . You think this could be a membre of our gang ... What 's her name , Sonya , the medic ? Could be any one of them . But if medical skills are required she 's the one providing it . How long do you keep the dead ? Weeks , sometimes months if they go unclaimed . Is Jaworski still here ? Yeah . His body is evidence in our investigation . Can you take me to him , please ? How much longer ? The network security of this decade is a complete joke . Can you get it , quickly ? Somewhere . A medical supplies warehouse is accepting payment . From a financial institution that 40 years from now will epitomize everything we 're fighting against . So that 's a yes ? A Baker / August 5 000 , hospital grade . Where do you want it delivered ? Any house on the street . We 'll can intercept . What was done to him ? His organs were weighed and examined as part of the autopsy . Just following standard protocol . Why ? Did you find something you didn 't expect ? Yes , in fact . There were some structural abnormalities in his heart , lungs and CNS . How did you know ? That 's not up for discussion . Until you hear from me , you need to secure all the evidence you have relating to this man and consider it classified . Classified ? Yes . I 'll arrange to have it shipped to a safe location . She 's our expert on this gang . Do what she says . Understood . Thanks . Talk to you soon . Did you want to see the other body ? What other body ? Meet Brian Young . Came in yesterday . This changes things . It sure does . Pattern killing . Ritualistic mutilation . Mr. Young yesterday and Mr. Doolin today . I took the liberty of cross referencing both victims through all the crime databases . Came up with nothing . So ... There is no apparent connection between the victims ... If that holds up , we could be dealing with a serial killer . There is one connection . What 's that ? What 's missing ... We need to find out what exactly is being extracted from the victims . Talk to the M.E. In both cases the Pituitary Gland was extracted while the victim was alive . Alive ? As best as we can guess , from the physiology of the wounds . What does it do , this gland ? It 's an endocrine gland that produces many hormones but my guess is your suspect was after human growth hormone . They 're harvesting it . Excuse me ? Harvesting ? That 's my guess also . Believe it or not , this stuff has value on the black market . For who ? How much ? Athletes mostly . Coaches . And it 's expensive . Any reason that these two men were targeted for ' harvesting ' ? Anything linking them chemically ? Not that I can see . Blood type is different . I 'll need to run some more lab tests to be sure , but that could take weeks if I don 't know what to look for . We don 't have weeks . I need to know what to look for . Let 's go . Run whatever tests come to mind and call me if you find anything . What 's next ? Find the connection between our victims that no one has noticed yet . Nothing ? No common friends , no business interests , two completely different worlds . Nothing in any database linking the two vics . Maybe my ' contacts ' can help ? The people with the answers that nobody else seems to know . I need a database search . It doesn 't work that way . What ? You didn 't dial anyone . I told you . I need a search . Jeez , you 're really missing the point of this thing . Coming right up . I have to call you back . Julian . Your Mom asked me to come and get you . Everyone 's here . Okay then . Alec ? Yeah , I 'm coming ! Come on , dude , everyone 's here . Let 's go ! Hello ? Hello ? Nice to know even the government drops calls . Just wait till the phone company is the government . That 's a scary thought . As long as we are dependent on corporations for their food growing technologies , we become slaves to those who would use technology to enslave us . The forces that control our lives are counting on that same fascination with technology . They market it to us knowing that we are too hungry ... How is he ? Alive . Unlike some people around here . Is that supposed to be some kind of threat ? Yes . What was Kellog on about ? Kellog has always been ... different . He 's up to something . Breaking ranks on us ... sneaking out on his own .. What do you suggest ? What would you do if you were in my shoes ? Take him out . And violate our oath we swore to each other ? Before he has a chance to make a play . I 'm just thinking of you , Travis . Do you mind if I ... Just for a sec , real quick . Thank you . What are you doing ? What are you up to , Kellog ? You know that lady Protector who came through with us ? What about her ? I 'm setting that bitch up . Mom ? I 'm heading back out to the barn- - To work . Okay . Let me help you with that . Thank you sweetheart . Why are you always in here alone cleaning up after people ? It 's no bother . I 'm happy to . Why can 't Roland , or Julian do it , it 's their group . Don 't tell me they converted you too ? Honey . I realize that it 's asking a lot of you to listen to your Stepfather and his beliefs , but that is all I 'm asking you to do , is just listen . Nobody is expecting you to change the way you live , or stop your work . But he 's full of crap . He has his beliefs , honey , as we all do . If you want him to respect yours then you have to respect his , right ? There 's a very good man in there , who is trying to reach out to you . I 'll try really hard , Mom . For you . I don 't understand how you find anything with this antiquated system ? Well we can 't all have unlimited budgets like some people , or there 'd be no inter-agency jealousy . Ok , I 'm back . Excellent . What 's excellent ? The work you 're doing . What are you talking about ? I 've got nothing . Sperm ? Sperm ? They both were paid a couple hundred bucks by the same fertility clinic . It 's a sperm bank south of downtown . South Creek Fertility Services . How 'd you come up with that ? Look ! Both of them are listed as receiving payment . Sperm . Dr. Gibson ? We need a word . Detective Fonnegra , VPD . You 'll have to schedule an appointment with my secretary . This will take a second . We need access to your client database . Absolutely not , those records are confidential . Now if you 'll excuse me . Alec ? Dr. Ted Gibson , I 'm on it . You are going to love this . I understand where you are coming from , but I 've got two bodies in the morgue with holes drilled into their back of skulls and the only connection between the two of them is you . If you 're suggesting I had anything to do with any murders , you should be talking to my lawyers . We 're not saying you had anything to do with the murders . And if you 'll just give us a second I can explain . No , let me explain to you . I 'm not the kind of man who appreciates being accosted by police officers who seem to have forgotten a little right called doctor / patient confidentiality . That didn 't seem to bother you in 2002 , Seattle , I believe , when you revealed the names of your " premium " donors to some of your patients and charged extra for their ... services . How much does the sperm from a Nobel Prize runner up go for these days ? That case was settled . The records sealed . How did you find out ... ? She has her sources . Like what you 're doing with your hair . Clinic records are on the way . What 's the play ? If the killer used the clinic database to find his victims , there should be a link to their records . Then we might be able to ID the next victim before another murder . I 'm Looking for Detective Fonnegra . Right here . We 've got the files from the Fertility Clinic . That was fast . Are they on a jump drive or on CDs ? I 've got 45 of these babies down in the truck . Where do you want ' em ? 45 of these babies ! The files don 't indicate any commonalities between the two victims . What are you looking for ? We need to isolate the matching genetic marker . Give me a sec . Ok , here we go . Both men have an identical chromosome that 's tied to pituitary mutation . Both victims have an identical chromosome that 's tied to pituitary mutation . Dormant here , but the kind of thing that could be triggered ... What is that ? How do you even know about it ? With the right equipment , this natural hormone could be synthesized into a powerful metabolic drug . What , like a steroid ? Like a super-steroid ... The kind of thing that the military might use to build a better soldier ... These guys need this steroid ? Did you check for a military program with a profile that matches this one ? Not yet . Let 's get on it . So our perps are searching the fertility clinic database , looking for clients with this marker ? Which means we are going to have to test the rest of these files for the same genetic marker . We should also check into any highly sophisticated medical equipment that 's been stolen in the last week . Why that ? Because human growth hormone needs to be synthesized into a serum in order to be effective . How soon before we can start work ? Give me 20 minutes . You can have five . Come on ! How am I an idiot ? You suck ! Come on ! I 'm done . No , I 'm not talking to you . You know you can go faster . Forgot , you don 't want Detective Do Right to know what you 're doing . Fine , but just know that I 've calculated at this rate It 's going to take at least seven more hours to get the info in . Just saying . Okay you win . What ? Take two folders . Open them side by side . Next . You understand this genetic crap ? Sorta . Next . Wait , got a match . You got a match ! How did you see that ? I 've got a knack for patterns ... Next . Next . What are you doing , Kellog ? Minding my own business . Give that to me . Why an address ? It 's nothing . It 's ... It 's noth ... I don 't believe you . You know as well as I do that Travis may not make it . If someone were to do something , make a statement by action that impressed the others , that would go along way to putting them in a position to take over . You 're not making any sense . If someone brought back the head of the Protector on a platter , that would register . That would make an impact . It wouldn 't be difficult . All you need to know is ... where to go . An address . Give me that . You 're gonna shoot me , Kellog ? Give me that . That 's what I thought . I can give you more information down at the station . I need you to come down , try and make an ID from photographs of anyone suspicious you might have noticed following you . Yeah . Okay , thanks . Did we get them all ? Not all . A Herbert George did not answer . We have to pay Mr. George a visit . Is there an address ? Faber College . He 's a student . I had a couple of friends who went here . What about yourself ? What about me ? Did you go to college ? John Jay , for law enforcement . Police work 's all I ever wanted to do . Me too . Yeah ? Where 'd you go ? Union Military . Class of ... I almost had you . No , not even close . Pretty close . And that 's as close as you 're gonna get . We 'll see about that . Hold on . Fonnegra . Okay . Great . Thanks . Herbert George , registered room 316 . Also works in the campus kitchen . Which I think is pretty close to here ... Rock , paper , scissors ? Follow what Carlos does . On three , make a fist . On three . One , two , three ! Damn . I 'll take the kitchen . Call me if you find him . What did we just do ? I 'm sorry , did I just teach you something you didn 't know ? Alec ? Sorry , that was just me , savoring the moment . Continue . Please . Hello ? Herbert George ? You 're like the third person who has been looking for him . I keep telling people . There 's no Herbert here . My old roommate dropped out in the first quarter , other bed 's been empty ever since . Herbert George . Carlos ! I just checked his room . There is no Herbert George . This is a set up ! Slow down . Take it easy . Shut up . Police ! Freeze ! Put your weapon down ! Carlos ... Do it now ! I said drop it asshole ! I don 't think so ! Where 's the bitch ? I 'm going to let you guys figure this out . Get down ! Move ! Shit ! This is going to be easy . You don 't know when to quit , sweetheart , do you ? You ... just don 't ... either ... sweetheart . It 's over . You want to go home ? You 're going home . You 've got it backwards . Carlos ! You 're gonna be okay , Carlos . Travis ! Good to see you back on your feet . What happened to you ? Curtis happened . Go on . I was going to take out the cop . I had her set up and sitting pretty when Curtis muscled in on the plan . Tried to take me out . What were the two of you thinking ? ! We wanted to impress the others in case ... in case you didn 't make it . I 'm not impressed . And now we 're five ! I 'm here to make it right . My god , you 've been tagged ! Tagged ? What ? ! You got a homing beacon in your bloodstream . Perimeter ! Now ! She shot me , I didn 't know what it was ! You could have led the Protector back to us . I didn 't know what it was ! What should we do ? I know what to do . Kiera ? Yes ? You were about to walk us through the events ? Of course . Carlos ... Detective Fonnegra and myself traced the next potential victim to this address ... What she 's trying to say is that it was over before she got here . You can read about it in my report , Sir , but ... the bottom line is that Curtis Chen , one of the Liber8 killers , is off the board , permanently . A good day 's work by any definition . Special Agent Cameron made the connection to the clinic that allowed us to get him . They won 't be targeting anyone else . I may have finished the job , but she definitely deserves the credit . Nice work . I look forward to reading that report . - Thank you . - Yeah ... The last thing you need right now is the scrutiny that comes with an officer-involved fatality . Let me take the heat on this one . This is the least I can do . I do have one last question : Maybe later you can tell me what actually happened here . Maybe . I 've got a few things to clear up first . Thanks , okay . I want to take care of them and ... See you back at the station . Dammit . Alec , where are you ? Living large . What can I do for you ? My suit is damaged . I wouldn 't know where to begin . What did you do to it ? That 's not the point . My suit was short-circuited . And I really need it . I tagged Kellog with a trans-dermal location dart that stays in his bloodstream for 24 hours . I need to track it , but I can 't call anything up on the suit . Give me the frequency . I 'll see what I can do . Hi . Comfortable ? My friends weren 't very understanding when I came back here tagged . I scanned the perimeter . No sign of the others , no ambush . What 's going on ? They left me here to keep you busy while they move to a new place . Herbert George ... Wells . HG Wells . The Time Machine . A classic . I thought you 'd appreciate the reference . I don 't appreciate that you almost got me killed . I delivered Curtis like room service . Room service doesn 't shoot back . I never said it would be easy . So what now ? We 're both adults . The house is empty or not . You could arrest me I suppose , but I can 't help you from a prison cell . You can 't hurt me from one either . I have no intention in hurting you . Quite the opposite . Untie me ? Give me one good reason . I know how these animals think . I can help you protect the innocent people who might get in their way . That 's your job isn 't it ? You 're a terrorist and a revolutionary . What ? No ! That guy won 't be born until 2041 ... I 'm a guy with a bad future , ready for a fresh start . What do you have to lose ? You mess with me now and not only will I kill you in this time , but I 'll make it my mission to guarantee that you 're never born in the future . Are we clear ? Absolutely . What 's happening ? We got her . We got the Queen of Hearts . Tag and ship this waste of space . Run ! How can you be sure the gang won 't still need victims for their serum ? Kellog told me they synthesized enough to last indefinitely . Can you trust him ? Probably not . But the fact that his own gang tried to blow him up , makes me feel a little better about the situation . What are you doing ? You could get into trouble . It 's only a matter of time before those two bodies in the morgue raise questions . If I 'm ever going to get home , the last thing I need is the trail that leads here . A girl 's gotta have secrets . = = sync , corrected by elderman = = If I make the wrong decision , millions could be affected . We consider the death of Professor Ames and the theft of his work to be a matter of national security . That 's Edouard Kagame . The leader of the gang ? Its heart and soul . These scientists are playing God . And in a way , so are you .

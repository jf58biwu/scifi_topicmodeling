 Come in . Anyone ? Anybody out there ? [ crying ] We 're sick . I 'm broadcasting in the blind . Mama ? Mama ? Mama ? In the blind ! [ coughing ] mama , please don 't fall asleep . Sam : Mama , we 're gonna get you help . Wake up , mama , please ! [ coughs ] Jed : Anyone , please ? Anyone out there ? Anyone - - damn it ! [ coughing ] Mama , please don 't fall asleep ! Wake up , mama ! [ echoes ] mama ! [ click ] [ clicks ] What 's your name ? [ click , beep ] [ clicks ] [ clicks ] [ clicks ] You sure you have enough for the whole crew ? And 50 or 60 more . When we get home , We can use this as a vaccine and a cure ? The uninfected will be immunized , and ... The sick can be cured , Providing they 're not too far gone . After all the failures and the false starts , I just feel so - - Happy ? [ exhales sharply ] I can 't truly remember the last time That I felt that emotion . Still so much to do . We have to mass produce it , We have to distribute it . Thank god - - rachel ... You did it . Let 's enjoy the moment . I told her how I feel . I mean ... [ exhales ] Basically spilled my guts to her . I mean , sure , I 'm spiking a 104-degree fever , But still . " you make me wanna love again . " I actually said that . And what does she give me ? Zip . What I understand about women , you fit in a shot glass . I don 't need to tell you . [ whines ] [ indistinct conversations ] Hey , how are you feeling ? I don 't get seasick , so ... [ exhales ] I 've never seen morning sickness on a d.D.G. Before . [ exhales ] have you seen a nursery ? [ chuckles ] no . [ door opens ] form up . [ sighs ] Okay , here 's the deal . We are presently attempting to make contact With the infectious disease lab at fort detrick , As it has just the facility dr . Scott requires For mass producing the cure . So far we 've had no joy . I 'll be honest - - Knowing how deadly this plague is and how fast it spreads , I don 't have any confidence That there 's gonna be any survivors , so ... That being said , There 's a reason they call it a fort . And if anyone can hold their own , It 's our friends in the u.S. Army . Master chief . Thank you , sir . I want to address the issue that 's on all of our minds . On our way up the coast , Our ship will be passing right by norfolk - - by home . And our comms team tells us we could pick up Some orphan signals from random cell towers Or servers still online . You may even get a phone call If they 've restored power on land . It 's unlikely , but I just wanna prepare you . We don 't know what to expect when we get back to the states . The only way to help the people we love Is to deliver dr . Scott and the cure To a secure and workable lab . Detrick 's our best bet , so that 's our mission . All : Aye , sir . Carry on . Any station in this net vicinity Of fort detrick u.S.A.M.R.I.I.D. , This is u.S.S. Nathan james , over . Aye , sir . Captain , s.S.E.S. Reports that the keyhole satellite Will be flying over our whiskey in 50 seconds . Unable to steer , But they did manage to break the uplink / downlink encryption . Bringing up the feed now . [ beeping ] [ exhales deeply ] it 's traveling fast . Too fast , sir . There 's no one left at home to control it . When it gets over the area , We 'll have less than a minute to capture the images we can . We just need enough to chart a clear route From the land to the lab . We 've tapped into one of the air force 's spy satellites To check the traffic to fort detrick . Well , why not send your helicopter or drone ? No more fuel . They spent it all looking for me . Kara : Satellite passing over us . [ static ] Mason : Any station ... Come on , give us something . There it is . [ beeps ] Home . That 's interstate 70 . If it 's clear , it 'll get us all the way to detrick . There 'll be some image blur , but I 'll get you closer , sir . [ clicks ] That 's a mass evacuation . Take us north a mile . Aye , sir . [ typing ] Any station this net vicinity of fort detrick u.S.A.M.R.I.I.D. , This is u.S.S. Nathan james ... That red " x " - - some sort of quarantine ? More like a warning sign to stay away . Looks like people took it seriously . Sir , the satellite 's approaching fort detrick . I say again , Anyone at fort detrick , please respond . The laboratory building 's in the center of campus . Roger that , ma 'am . Zooming in . [ whispers ] oh , my god . [ normal voice ] it 's been completely destroyed . The lab , the containment areas , the equipment , everything . Nothing else on the base was burned . That lab was targeted . Who would 've done that ? Slow down ! Slow down ! Stop the car . Where you goin ' ? My family 's sick . They need help . Can 't go this way . Turn around . Please . Please , we 're just trying - - Trying to get to olympia . Olympia can 't help you . Go back where you came from , old man . [ window whirs ] Get down . [ shifts gear ] [ gasps ] [ engine revs , tires screech ] [ children scream ] [ gunshots ] [ machine gunfire in distance ] [ engine revs , tires screech ] [ man shouts indistinctly ] Should we go after ' em ? No . They 'll be dead soon . Sir ! Sir ! Take a breath . What is it ? I caught a new broadcast . It 's another loop . But this one was updated today . And there 's something you need to hear . Woman : Winds are coming out of the southwest , And temperatures will reach 50 degrees in baltimore ... How come we 're just hearing this now ? Probably a weak f.M. Transmitter , sir . It must 've just come into range . There are reports of a fresh outbreak of the red flu In sector 9 . " red flu . " Is that what they 're calling it ? Doesn 't do it justice somehow . It 's looping around . Here it comes . U.S.S. Nathan james , we are aware of your mission And we have secured the facility you may require . If you are within range of this signal , We urge you to reply over channel 1-6 . I repeat , u.S.S. Nathan james , if you are still out there , Please reply on v.H.F. Channel 1-6 . Get them on the line . Yes , sir . This is u.S. Naval warship nathan james Hailing you on channel 1-6 . We have heard your call , over . This is u.S.

You let me know as soon as you find out . Good work , son . [ door alert dinging ] schools have reopened in sector 3 , And some city services are set to resume . [ coughs ] Attention , attention , This call goes out to the crew of the u.S.S. Nathan james . We are aware of your mission And we have secured the facility you may require . If you are in range of the signal , We urge you to reply over channel 1-6 . I repeat - - u.S.S. Nathan james , If you are still out there ... Jed ? Did you hear that , darien ? Tom 's still out there . People are waiting for him . Don 't worry , sweetheart . You 're gonna make it . You hang in there . [ keys jangle ] [ engine sputters , turns over ] Quincy : I had to do what was best - - [ door opens ] Kelly : Best for whom ? Please listen to that . Rachel : Ava ? Kelly : We have been through it . They 're at it again . Quincy : You know that I love you . Events - - they just happen on a mind of their own ... I know that things are better now . But ... I don 't think they 'll be the same again . Hello , kelly . Hi . Ava , darling , shall we go and find something to eat ? All right . I 'll see you later . I 'll see you later . Bye . She can 't forgive me for what I put them through . To be honest , I don 't blame her . Well , when the captain finds the right place For us to put ashore , Maybe you can all start again On more solid ground . Captain , I 've got baltimore . A mrs . Granderson is on the line . Did you say granderson ? Yes , sir . Well , put her through . They 're trying to use the vidcom , But so far it can only get audio , sir . Go ahead , sir . This is tom chandler , Commanding officer of the u.S.S. Nathan james , over . Captain chandler . You have no idea how good it is to hear your voice . We thought you were lost at sea . No , ma 'am , we 're alive and well . Oh ! There you are . I got it . You must be nearby . I 'm amy granderson . And I suppose an explanation is in order . As vice-chair of The president 's defense policy board , I was briefed on your mission to the arctic . I knew the risks of the coming pandemic , And I had my daughter transferred to your ship . You must forgive me . No apology needed , ma 'am . Your daughter 's been an incredible asset . Pleased to hear from you . We had no word from the presidential bunker . President geller invited me underground . I declined . I-I felt the risk was too big To have so much of our civilian and military command In one confined space . Unfortunately , I was right . So the government is gone . For the most part , yes . Since the bunker went silent , There has been a breakdown of infrastructure , General panic , and , of course , a tremendous loss of life . I have tried to execute a contingency plan Working with the state and local police To create safe zones . We have been hanging on as best we can . And I have been praying every day for your return . Ma 'am , we can be in baltimore in the matter of hours . In the meantime , I 'm sure there is someone you 'd like to speak with . Mom ? Alisha ! Mom , I don 't - - I don 't understand - - What are you doing ? Where are you ? I 'm here , darling . Oh , I knew you were out there . I just knew it . Thorwald . [ water splashing ] We 've intercepted a transmission . A u.S. Navy ship is due to make port in a matter of hours In baltimore harbor . What kind of ship ? I don 't know , sir . Well , is it a tug ? A destroyer ? A 5,000-sailor aircraft carrier ? The signal was spotty . All we know is the name . Nathan james . It 's the ship they 've been hailing for weeks . Granderson 's sending out a greeting party . Well , if they 're having a party ... Then let 's party . Man : We are cleared , baltimore . [ speaks indistinctly ] ... The port distance 1,000 yards . No threats , no contact . Man : All commands reporting ... [ speaks indistinctly ] Man : V.B.S.S. On the way to designated meeting point . Kara : E.W. Reports negative rackets of interest . Nothing moving on surface plot . Clean picture . Bridge ? C.I.C. A.T.T.W.O. Reports s.C.A.T. Team manned and ready At all crew-served weapon stations port and starboard . Jeter : All right , let 's move . Fan out . Aye , sir . Secure a perimeter . Dennis and rowler , left flank . Cruz , you take right . Keep your hands on the swivel , fellas . [ man speaks indistinctly ] Man : Perimeter secure . Man : Keep eyes on upper structures . Copy . Slattery : Here they come . [ men speaking indistinctly ] Hi ! Hey . I 'm lieutenant pete norris of the maryland state police . Inside my vehicles are my assistant barrack commander , My criminal section supervisor , And a few surviving state troopers . You don 't need the masks . We 're not sick . I 'm lieutenant green , this is lieutenant burk . It 's a pleasure to make your acquaintance , lieutenant . [ chuckles ] Bridge , burk . The pier is secure . All clear , over . [ radio static ] Understand . All clear on the beach . Landing party underway . [ radio chirps ] Welcome to baltimore . [ laughs ] hey , it 's great to be here . Looks like the troopers just got themselves A couple hundred u.S. Sailors . A few dozen tomahawks , too . Looks like a landing party arriving . Thorwald : Including the captain . You must be lieutenant norris . Tom chandler , c.O. , nathan james . Pleasure to meet you . This is lieutenant landau . Ma 'am . Sir . Hey . How y 'all doin ' ? Just fine , now that you 're here . We can escort you guys back to our h.Q. Thorwald : Here comes another van . Man : Cobra 1 in place . All clear on the beach . [ engine turns off , doors close ] Holy shit . What ? [ voice breaking ] mom ? I had to come see for myself . Oh , my baby girl . It 's her . It 's granderson . She came out herself . I am so glad to have you back . Captain chandler , thank you . Thank you for returning my daughter to me . Privilege , ma 'am . We wouldn 't be here without her . Take the shot . Mrs. Granderson , We really need to get you back in the vehicle . She 's blocked . Come . Everyone 's eager to meet you . I can take out the fat man . No ! You only have one shot . I want her . Danny : Nathan james , Looks like we 're having a bit of a family reunion here . We 're headed out with the group . Sending lieutenant norris back with the v.B.S.S. To update you on the situation on the ground , sir . Roger that . We 'll arrange a welcome for lieutenant norris . Oh , and say " hi " to mom for us . Damn it ! I lost her . Talk to your friends on the inside . Find out what they 're doing here . [ click ] Man : Let 's go ! [ dog barking in distance ] [ doors close ] We were fortunate to find this building . There 's only one coal-fired plant still operational , And we have a direct line . Plus , strategically we 're far enough from the city To avoid infection . You 'll be safe here . Come . Mom , this is amazing . Oh , yes , but it 's been a battle . And who 's the enemy ? Warlords , they call themselves . And recently , they 've killed More people than the actual virus . Do you know they raided the national archives ? They actually tried to steal Original copies of the constitution . As if that could take away who we are as a people . Captain . I didn 't want to broadcast about the virus Over an open radio feed , but ... The president told me that you had the materials To produce a vaccine . Is that true ? Yes , ma 'am . We 've actually made a little more progress than that , Mrs. Granderson . [ inhales sharply ] We have the cure . Fort detrick was our first option , too . They had the lab and all , but , uh , Thorwald got there first . Thorwald . Former baltimore p.D. Turned self-proclaimed leader Of the warlords . Been a real pain in our ass since this whole thing started . I shouldn 't complain . [ chuckles ] I imagine you 've been through a hell of a time yourselves . Listen , lieutenant , last I talked to my wife , She said was taking the family to deer park . Safe zone . Heard of it . You know if it 's still there ? There was fighting , but there are survivors . I can get you there as soon as we get you off the ship . [ click , hiss ] ooh ! Thanks , doc . You have no idea how good that felt . Well , I have some idea . Yeah . [ click ] Man : What were the results of the test ... [ speaks indistinctly ] See , these results are consistent ... Now this is the main reason we chose this building . [ speaking indistinctly ] We 've worked for months trying to develop a cure . But now you 're here . [ exhales ] it 's heavenly . [ clapping ] [ door opens ] you 're not gonna like this , boss . My guy inside granderson 's said the ship came back with a cure . It could be bullshit . We 've heard this before . Not from the u.S. Navy . If that 's true , granderson will spread out , Go anywhere she wants . We will lose the city . We need to get our hands on the cure . It 's probably locked away somewhere on the ship . The only way is to take granderson on directly . We have to take her lab . Rachel : Extraordinary . Look at her . [ speaks indistinctly ] She 's in love with a toaster . You still haven 't made your move yet ? Oh , I 've been making my move since gitmo . She ain 't buying what I 'm selling . I thought once she saved the world , She 'd let loose a little . [ chuckles ] Jeter : Nathan james , this is vulture one . Do you copy ? [ lowered voice ] this is her letting loose . I repeat - - nathan james , this is vulture one . Do you copy ? I can 't get through , sir . You won 't get a signal here , master chief . The warlords are jamming the local frequencies . They have a radio room , sir . I let the x.O. Know where we are . Ma 'am , uh , if that radio room is still available , I 'd like to get word to my family , See if they 're still out there . I think it 's time you thought of yourself . Meanwhile , we can work with your team To arrange safe transit here for your ship 's crew . Due to warlord activity ...

I 'm moving on . By yourself ? But it 's chaos out there . I 've seen worse . And thanks to you , I can travel wherever I like . Where will you go ? I , uh , got things to take care of . The young girl whose picture that you keep in your locket . Among other things , yeah . Anyway , you seem to have things plenty well in hand here . Right then .

Truck stop ? What happened ? Are you on the road ? Onik truck stop . It 's a tire shop downtown . We can get you there . Listen to me . Stay put . I 'm coming for you . Put these jackets on .

Can 't do that , sir . What do you mean ? Olympia 's off-limits . It 's for sick people . But we 're immune . You got the shots , too . Get back in the car . We 're going back to base . We 're going to olympia . You don 't give the orders , captain . Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Get back in the cars ! Whoa ! Drop your weapons ! Get back in the car ! Drop your weapons ! You don 't want to do this , trooper ! We 're on the same side ! Everybody calm down ! [ gun cocks ] Aah ! Aah ! Master chief ! I 'm all right ! I 'm okay . Nathan james , this is vulture two .

Your friend lived in wisconsin . There 's no way to get there now . [ pouring coffee ] Soon , maybe . But if we make - - Soon . Now ... Tell me this - - What kind of man is captain chandler ? He 's amazing . Without him , we wouldn 't have gotten through any of this . So he hasn 't the let the power go to his head ? I 'm not sure I understand the question . I 'm asking if he will still follow orders . Follow orders from whom ? Mother , what 's going on ? [ equipment whirring ] Michael , have you seen these protocols ? Of course . Why ? Well , dr . Hamada claims that his treatment Prolongs the lives of the infected . But his whole assumption about the virus Seems to be wrong . [ huffs ] I 'm just a statistician , But the data he 's given me suggests The treatment 's working . No , that 's impossible . Is something wrong ? Dr. Hamada , You 're using ribavirin to introduce Higher error rates to the virus ' d.N.A. Replication . In a chemical cocktail , yes . Yes , but the pandemic virus is error-free . Your treatment wouldn 't have any positive effect whatsoever . In fact , these dose levels are highly toxic . Um ... [ indistinct chatter over p.A. ] [ turnstiles clacking ] Man : Go through the turnstile and wait for assessment . [ indistinct conversations , chatter over p.A. Continues ] [ child crying in distance ] [ indistinct conversations ] Daddy ? Daddy ? Daddy ! Ashley ! Daddy ! Ashley ! Daddy ! [ sobbing ] oh , my god . [ crying ] sammy ... Sammy ... Daddy ...

[ gasps ] [ sobbing ] Slattery : You stack the cases by the hangar door , We 'll put ' em on a pallet and unload ' em dockside As soon as we make port . I 'm not sure exactly when that 's gonna be - - Oh , hey , norris , answer a question for us if you could . Yes , sir . Hey ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Commander . Commander ! I want you to get on the horn And give the order to drop anchor . You muster your entire crew on the flight deck And you open up the door to the helo bay Where you 're storing the cure . I 'm not giving you a goddamn thing , you son of a bitch . I don 't know what your plan is here , but this is my ship ! You 'll do exactly what I say , Or I 'll pick off your entire crew one-by-one . My troopers are everywhere . This ship is mine now . Please , he needs help . Hey - - Call doc rios ! Nobody moves ! [ shouting indistinctly ] nobody moves ! Put down that weapon !

Ahh ! Ahh ! Ahh ! I 'm not gonna tell you again , commander . Muster your crew . [ exhales ] [ door opens ] Doctor . My troopers say they experienced no side effects From the cure . It 's amazing what you 've created . I wish I could say the same in return . I understand you have some questions About the way we 've been treating the sick . What you are giving the sick Is anything but a treatment - - of that I am sure . Doctor ... You know this . In the 14th century , the black death Wiped out 60 % of the european population . The plague killed indiscriminately - - The artists , scientists , thinkers , So few and precious to begin with , Were wiped out . It upended the social order And prolonged the dark ages 150 years . I cannot let that happen here . [ breathing erratically ] Granderson : I understand your allegiance to your friends . You 've gone through so much together . But you 've seen nothing of the chaos here at home . The hysteria , The cruelty , the savagery . You must try to see the situation From our point of view . There are people out there who would use this crisis To take what does not belong to them . They are the barbarians at the gate Who would send us into a new dark age . We have the power to stop them , To keep them in their place . It is my duty to help the right people first , The people whose survival will ensure The future of our entire society ... And all that we hold dear . So you gather your elite few Within these walls . And the rest - - What happens to them ? The virus doesn 't discriminate . That unfortunate task falls to me . [ indistinct chatter over p.A. ] [ man coughs in distance ] [ clicks ] Pl- - [ breathing erratically ] Plea- - plea- - Please ... [ whimpering ] [ gasping ] Hey , what are you doing ? You can 't be here ! You 're killing them . Get the hell back behind the curtain ! You 're killing them ! Stay back ! You sick bastards ! Man : Hey , you can 't be here ! [ gunfire ] Captain , we gotta move ! Man : Security breach in section 12 . Repeat - - security breach in section 12 . [ truck engine revving ] I don 't - - I don 't - - I don 't get it . They 're burning ' em . They 're burning the bodies to power the city . [ clicks ] I know it 's hard to understand . You 've been away so long . But in time , rachel , you 'll see it 's the only way . She was trying to run . Dr. Scott , I swear I had no idea this was happening . I swear - - hush , dear . You can 't replicate my work With the doses that I 've given you . Everything that you need is locked up on that ship . And the captain will never give it up . You let me worry about the captain . Daddy ... We have to go . [ radio static ] nathan james , come in . Do you read me ? [ radio static crackling ] Nathan james , come in . Do you read me ? Nathan james , this is the captain .

 Previously on Heroes ... Wait a second . Is that Claire ? - Samuel wants to surrender . - Really ? - Why ? - To protect his family . { \ * He 's willing to } He 'll turn himself over as long as the rest of the carnival stays safe and under the grid . I found him on the hill ... with this ! { \ * Peter , } She 's gonna kill thousands of people . It will be a bloodbath . Tell me exactly what you saw . - You cannot save her . - But someone else can . Don 't worry . I 'm here to save you . He 's trapped { \ * , Peter } . - What { \ * the hell } did you do ? - { \ * I went inside his head , and } I trapped him in his worst nightmare . He 'll never hurt anyone again . - I have to bring him back . - { \ * No , } You can 't do that . { \ * You go into his head , } You might not come out . Peter , don 't ! Is that really you ? { \ * I came to get you out of here . } Came to get you out . It is you , isn 't it ? I thought I was alone { \ * here } , that everyone was dead . - What are you doing here ? - { \ * I came } To drag your sorry ass out of here . { \ * Now , } Let 's go . There is no getting out { \ * of here , Peter } . I 've tried ... for three years . What are you talking about ? It 's been three hours . Wait a minute . You 're not ... { \ * really here . } you 're not real . { \ * It 's just } This is my mind , isn 't it ? This is my mind playing tricks on me , as part of my punishment , isn 't it ? You think { \ * I 'm gonna } I 'll let you taunt me ? { \ * You } Stay away . If you follow me , { \ * I will } I 'll kill you ! Do you understand { \ * me } ? I swear I 'll kill you . Get out of my head . Calm down . I 'm telling you the truth . I came to take you out of here . Why do you keep saying that ? I went to Parkman 's house { \ * to look for you } . He put you here . - This is a dream . - { \ * No , } It 's not a dream ! This is real . You don 't understand this is a nightmare ? { \ * You really don 't understand that this is all just a nightmare ? } Hell , yes , it 's a nightmare . Three years , completely alone . Not years , hours . All right ? Parkman trapped you here . - Parkman ? { \ * That 's } Impossible . - Is it ? What 's the last thing you remember before coming here ? I remember ... wanting my life to change , thinking I was gonna spend all of eternity alone . Exactly . And here you are . { \ * Look , } I 've got Parkman 's ability . I can take you out of here . Why would you want to do that ? The brother of the man I murdered coming to my aid ? Because I need you to help me . { \ * Look , } I could leave you here to rot , but I need you to save her , my friend Emma . In the dream , you save her before she kills thousands of people . { \ * You got the } Wrong guy . I 'm not the savior kind , and you should know that { \ * better than anybody } . It 's gonna happen , and you 're gonna save her . Fine . You really think you can get us out of here ? Let me see you try . Go ahead . See ? { \ * We 're not going } We won 't go anywhere . We 're trapped here , forever . - We got to do something with her . - We will { \ * , Eli } . { \ * If you 'll } Excuse me . { \ * I want to } I wanna see my father . He 's safe , unharmed , { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } which is more than he deserves after shooting { \ * into a crowd of } innocent people . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } My dad didn 't shoot anyone . If he had , you would be dead . You 're not that naive , are you { \ * , Claire } ? { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } { \ * Your father } He came to this carnival with a gun , intent on using it . Isn 't that why you tried to negotiate my surrender ? { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } - You were afraid he 'd do this . { \ * Because you were afraid he was gonna do something like this ? } - I want to see my father now ! { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } Your devotion to your father is touching , but you 're blinded by it . It 's time for you to open your eyes and see your father for who he { \ * really } is . { \ pos ( 250,215 ) } I know who he is . Nothing you say will change that . { \ * and nothing you say to me is gonna change that . } Of course not . That 's why { \ * I 'm gonna } I 'll show you . - Dad ! - { \ * Claire . } Thank God you 're all right . Untie him . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } Not quite yet . Damien has the ability to reveal a person 's memories . It 's fairly painless if you don 't fight it . { \ pos ( 128,230 ) } You think showing { \ * me } my dad 's memories is gonna enlighten me ? You deserve { \ * to know } the truth . Let her go { \ * , Samuel } . You don 't need her anymore . { \ pos ( 128,230 ) } You afraid she 'll see the real you { \ * , Bennet } ? { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } Don 't do this . Take a peek { \ * , Claire } . See where it all began . { \ * All right , now , } This one has it all . White walls , wire wheel covers , - wood grain , everything . - The kids 'll love it . - { \ * Well , } What 's the payment look like ? - $ 150 a month . I know , that 's kind of steep . { \ * , right ? } Look ... You didn 't hear this from me , { \ pos ( 240,210 ) } but { \ * you guys should } go to Val 's Discount Motors on La Cienega . { \ pos ( 128,210 ) } { \ * Get } The same model , maybe a year older , probably half of what you 'll pay here . { \ pos ( 260,268 ) } Thanks . Really appreciate that . Guess who ? { \ pos ( 270,268 ) } Let me see . Soft , lovely hands , long , supple fingers . I don 't know . Candy ? { \ pos ( 260,268 ) } - Candy ? - I 'm in trouble . It 's my wife . What are you doing here ? { \ pos ( 240,268 ) } I came by to see how the most handsome salesman 's doing . { \ * I just thought I 'd come by , see how the world 's most handsome salesman is doing . } { \ * Well , } If I see him , I 'll ask him . { \ pos ( 260,268 ) } Me ... not so good . I stink at this job . { \ pos ( 280,268 ) } - I have no killer instinct . - You don 't belong here . - You should be home writing plays . - Somebody has to pay the rent . Who needs money ? We can live on love . Wouldn 't that be nice ? What 's going on ? Is something wrong ? I hope not . It 's just I have some unexpected news . - And promise me you won 't get mad . - Kate , what is it ? I 'm pregnant . I know we didn 't plan this , and you always want to be the man with the plan , but ... You 're happy ? Of course , I 'm happy . I 'm gonna be a father ! You had another wife and family ? I 'm sorry I never told you . It doesn 't matter . Let him go . You 're not { \ * the least bit } curious about what happened to { \ * your father 's } his first wife ? { \ * No , } It 's his business ... { \ * If he wanted me to know ... } There are reasons he kept it secret { \ * from you , Claire } . Isn 't that right ? Let her go . You got what you wanted , someone to blame , me . Look at the fear in his eyes . He knows what 's coming . I 'll leave you with Damien . { \ * I think } You 'll find it very informative { \ * , Claire } . Don 't do this , you son of a bitch ! Did you order pot stickers ? Double order . You 're eating for two now . Can you believe this ? You and me , parents . What 's it gonna be like ? I have no idea . But I can 't wait to find out . The moo shu has arrived . Go . { \ * Go . } Delivery . What happened to Mr. Yin ? He usually delivers . He couldn 't make it . Okay , so ... how much do I owe you ? All of it . I can 't move . What did you do ? Where 's { \ * the rest of } the money ? - How did you do that ? - Kate , give him your purse . - This is it ? - That 's all { \ * we 've got } . Take it and go . What are you ? Kate ... { \ * Oh , } My God . Give it up { \ * , man } . Can 't go forever without talking to me . I mean , you 've gone a month . That 's impressive . There isn 't anybody out there . There never will be . { \ * I 'm not gonna } I won 't spend the rest of my life here , alone , with you . It isn 't exactly heaven for me either . Here . I know you like comics . I couldn 't find Doc Savage or Flash . { \ * What the hell is wrong with you ? } What 's wrong ? You need to stop messing around and focus . Focus , right ? ' cause we got to get out of here so we can go rescue ... What 's her name again ? Emma . Her name 's Emma . It 's time to face reality { \ * Peter } . That girl is gone . { \ * And } If she was meant to kill thousands , they 're dead too . Everybody 's dead except us . The only thing that 's real is us . You think you 've been here for years , but this is all just a dream . If this is all a dream , how are there books , huh ? - How did Parkman make books ? - Because it 's your dream . How could I { \ * possibly } know all the words to Pillars of the Earth or Catch-22 ? { \ * I don 't know , } Maybe you read it somewhere , - { \ * And } it 's in your subconscious . - { \ * Yeah , well , } I didn 't read 9th wonders ! - I did . - So now we 're in your head ? I don 't know ! I don 't know how this all works ! - Don 't you want to get out of here ? - Yeah , of course ! You don 't , do you ? - You don 't want to get out of here . - { \ * Look , } Maybe I deserve all this aloneness ... This nothing , maybe I earned it . Yeah , maybe you have , but I can 't do this on my own . I need you to help me ... All right , Peter . You want me to help you ? I want to help . Where did that come from ? That 's the wall from ... Parkman 's basement . What 's it doing here ? - This is our way out . - What ? Don 't you get it ? We have to break through . Can I help you ? I was just leaving . You 're hurt . Let me see . I 'm a doctor . Please . You don 't have to do this . I don 't want you to get in trouble . I have a hearing loss . Say that again ? My name is Lauren . I came here to stop Samuel Sullivan . You were with the man who shot everyone . Bennet ? Bennet never fired his gun . Your leader , Samuel , is not what he appears to be . He 's the one responsible . He wouldn 't shoot his own people . You 're wrong . He 's done terrible things . And now he 's trying to galvanize his people around a common enemy . I got to check in with the doc . Samuel 's coming . Don 't tell him I 'm here ! Everything all right ? { \ pos ( 217,220 ) } { \ $ We are not alone , are we ? } { \ pos ( 207,210 ) } { \ $ We don 't keep secrets here . } { \ pos ( 233,210 ) } { \ $ She said that you 're a bad man . } { \ pos ( 220,220 ) } { \ $ You did all this . Shot your own people ... } { \ pos ( 235,170 ) } { \ $ She 's misinformed . } { \ pos ( 138,235 ) } { \ $ Let me talk to her . } { \ pos ( 247,175 ) } { \ $ You can leave . } It 's all right . I just want to talk . Well , look what we have here . Your first wife was murdered by a special ? That was a long time ago . And the person I was then died that night with Kate . I 'm sorry I never told you { \ , Claire } . That 's okay . Some things you just can 't ... say out loud . But that 's the reason why you joined the company . That 's how you became Mr. Bag and tag . I don 't need to see any more . { \ fad ( 918,2211 ) } { \ $ ONE YEAR LATER } Don 't move . - { \ * What , } You want my wallet ? Take it . - { \ * I said , " don 't move " } Don 't move ! I 'm not after your money . What , then ? Information . I know what you are . I know what you can do . - How ? - It doesn 't matter . I 'm looking for somebody , one of you . One of me ? What are you talking about ? - { \ * You mean } There 's someone else like me ? - Don 't give me that . What you do isn 't normal . You have to know each other . The guy I 'm looking for is named Richard . He 's about 6 feet tall , got dark hair . Maybe 23 years old . He can move things with his mind . He killed my wife . I don 't know anyone else like me . I swear . I don 't believe you . - It was an accident . - You brought a gun . I didn 't know what I would find . I was scared . { \ * That 's } The first time you killed anyone { \ * , huh ? } . What happens next ? One owner , low miles , hottest car I got on the lot . It 's the best I can do , { \ * so } take it or leave it . - { \ * Well , I thought } You said ... - You know , { \ * If you don 't want it , } I got another buyer who 's chomping at the bit . What 's it gonna be ? I guess we 'll take it . Excellent choice . I 'll have my manager draw up the papers . Excuse me . Hey , there . - Can I interest you in a car ? - Not really . I 'm here to offer you a job . - Do I know you ? - We 've been watching you . The way you killed that special ... The repairman . We 'd been tracking him too , only you got there first . Relax . Your secret is safe with us . We 're impressed , so impressed , in fact , we 'd like you to come work for us . Who are you ? My name is Thompson . My associates and I can help you Find the man who killed your wife . And then you can help us ... find the rest . How 's it working out for you , the ... " one of us , one of them ? " To tell you the truth , it 's been quite an adjustment . I mean , Claude can go invisible anytime he wants . - It gives him a distinct advantage . - Advantage ? You 're supposed to be partners . What is it , trust issues ? I mean , how could it not be ? He 's abnormal . I mean , sometimes when I 'm alone , I get ... this feeling in my gut that he 's watching me . - You know what I mean ? - Yeah , I do . You know , your case is highly unusual , Bennet . How you came to our attention , what happened to your wife . It would be only natural that you would harbor a grudge . - What are you getting at ? - 17 cases , three deaths , all attributed to you . They were all accidents . That 's been verified . Two corned beefs . { \ * You boys } Need anything else ? No , we 're all set . Thanks . At this point , the company has too much invested in you to cut ties . But we do need you to make a change . Take a wife , start a family . Is that a joke ? It 'll put your life in balance , calm you down ... so there will be fewer incidents . A wife ? - I can 't do that again . - Sure , you can . That cute number who brought the sandwiches will do fine . And if I refuse ? You won 't . { \ * It 's like } The company arranged your marriage . They encouraged me but I chose your mother because I loved her . You know that . The company seems to make a lot of decisions for you . They made { \ * a lot of } many decisions . { \ * and } That 's all over with . All the memories you 're seeing now , that 's all they are . { \ * Everything you 're seeing now , all of it , all of the memories , that 's all they are . } It 's just the past . { \ fad ( 918,2211 ) } { \ $ TWO WEEKS AGO } Hey , Mr. Bennet . What are you doing here ? Came to see Claire . Would you know where she is ? { \ * You wouldn 't happen to know where she is , would you ? } . No idea . You don 't have to lie for her . I know that Claire stole the compass , and I would bet good money the two of you drove out to the carnival together . My question is , why didn 't she come back with you ? She wanted to stay . She said she 'd be back on Monday . You left her there ? Do you not see what 's happening ? That she is getting involved in something that she clearly doesn 't understand . Maybe she wants to understand it . This isn 't a game . These carnival people are killers . You don 't think I know that ? She needs to be with people like her . { \ * And } If they 're not good for her , { \ * you have to } trust her to know the difference . You have to stop encouraging her . You need to work with me on this { \ * , Gretchen } . - I want her to be happy . - She is happy , with you here in college , Living a normal life . What if that 's not enough for her ? It has to be . What 's he doing here ? Are you gonna erase my memory ? Not if you do what I ask . You were missing . I didn 't know how to find you , if I would find you . - You don 't trust me . - I don 't trust Samuel . - Gretchen is fine . - You threatened her ! And this was not some distant past . This was now . - You should eat . - Don 't need to eat . Don 't need to sleep . Don 't need anything . Any progress today ? It 's just like yesterday ... - And the day before that . - And ... the day before that . Now it 's been ... I don 't even know how long it 's been . - Don 't tell me how long it 's been . - You can 't even dent it , Peter . I don 't know how much longer you can keep this up . As long as it takes . I know that look . You have it all the time . What look ? Like when { \ * Howie } Kaplan beat you at the { \ * 50-yard } dash and { \ * you and I } we ran to school every morning and kept training and kept it up , right ? That is Nathan 's memory . That 's not yours . I told you to stop doing that . You 're not him . You 're nothing like him . So you 've told me . Look , { \ * Peter , } I know that I 've said it before , but ... I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry that I killed him . I 'm sorry that I took him from you . Sorry ! You keep saying that " I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . " That 's not gonna bring my brother back . - It doesn 't change anything . - You 're right ! Nothing changes ! We 're stuck here forever , you and me ! I can 't take it anymore . You 're with that company , - cut from the same cloth as Bennet . - This doesn 't have to end badly { \ * for you } . You can turn yourself in , release Bennet and his daughter . - { \ * Why would I want to do that ? } Why would I do that ? - { \ * Because } You love your family , and you don 't want them to get hurt , and they will get hurt . You people are always so sure of yourselves . { \ * Don 't you think I would know } I know what 's best for my own family . - And what is that ? - Change . We 're strong enough to show ourselves , take what 's { \ * rightfully } ours . You don 't have the right to take anything . Of course we do . We deserve admiration , respect . And you intend to hurt people to get it ? What would you have me do ? Continue with this life ? Live in a carnival ? Why not ? You 've lived here happily for years . Wasted years , unfulfilled years . I could 've been so much more . You know about me ? About the film ? Do you know how powerful I can really be ... if I brought them all here ? My brother said I could move mountains , cities . I wonder . Is it true ? Can I change the world ? I hope to God we never find out . What did the world ever do to you ? Should 've treated me better . Don 't do this , please . The Bennet girl left the house of mirrors . Well , I 'll just have to have a word with her . It 's time to gather the family . Tell them to pack up . We 're moving on to bigger { \ * and better } things . Tell them it 's gonna be the greatest show we 've ever done . You 've been quite helpful , Lauren . You and your friends take care of her , would you ? Thanks . What are you gonna do ? I 'm gonna end this . I can 't bring Nathan back , Peter . But I can sure as hell swing a sledgehammer . I 'm sorry to put you through that . { \ * Claire , } { \ * But } I hope through this painful experience you can finally see the truth . You were right , Samuel . My dad is a bad guy . I belong with you . You 're my hero . That 's what you want to hear { \ * , right ? } , { \ * That 's } what this is all about . Why didn 't you show me the memory my dad has of shooting Lydia ? { \ * Or was that just not } That wasn 't on the program ? Maybe he didn 't pull the trigger last night . But does that negate all the times that he has ? { \ * Your father , } To this day , he lies to you , deceives { \ * even } you , his darling daughter , because he can 't trust any of us . You actually thought that I would turn on him ? You just don 't understand , do you { \ * , huh } ? Maybe it was 'cause no one ever really loved you . You call these people your family , but they 're not . They fear you . Give me my dad , and we 're leaving . No , sorry . You 're too important { \ * to me , Claire } . Especially { \ * now } when everything 's ready to change . What 's going on ? Where 's everyone going ? I was talking to a new friend about who I am , what I can be . { \ * And } The way she looked at me , She was so afraid . I want to see that look again a thousand times over . Meaning what ? It 's time for our biggest show ever . No more hiding in the shadows . It 's time to show ourselves , be strong . We 're going to New York City , bring the whole place to Central Park . { \ * Then } We 'll show them how powerful we are . You can 't do that . Some lives will unfortunately be lost , but they 'll { \ * learn to } fear us , respect us . - It 's what we 've always wanted . - I have never wanted that . You will inherit this new world . It 's your legacy . { \ * And } You will remind them what I 've done long after I 've gone . That 's why { \ * it 's so important for you to } you must be a part of our family . You are desperate . And you 're small . I will never be a part of your family . You sound just like your father . I had so hoped to convince you . { \ * Maybe } In time , { \ * you 'll } you can change your mind . Don 't hold your breath . Right . Your father 's { \ * back } in the souvenir trailer . I had a little trouble with the government lady , playing some cat and mouse , but the mouse got away . - Do you want me to go find her ? - Not worth it . - Everything okay ? - It will be . Claire Bennet needs some time to think about my offer . { \ * I 'm gonna } I 'll give her that opportunity . I want to explain what you saw . We 'll talk about it later . What is that ? Now I 'm ready to go . - New York City . - Sounds fun . It will be . I 'm afraid you 'll have to join us later . There 's { \ * some } loose ends to attend to . Before Lydia died , she spoke of people who want to interfere with our plans . I 'll need you to stop them , permanently . Happy birthday . It 's not my birthday . { \ * Yeah , } I know . You just wore out your other copy ... and I saw that one , digging around . I appreciate you ... being patient with me , keeping me sane . That 's very kind of you { \ * , Peter } . Thank you . You want to know something weird ? Every time you pick that thing up , I think you 'll hit me really hard . { \ * I think you 're gonna hit me with it really hard . } That is weird , { \ * because } every time I pick it up , I feel like { \ * I 'm gonna } I 'll hit you { \ * with it } too . - Really hard . - Why ? Because you are who you are . I wish I could accept your apologies , but if I forgive you , { \ * then } I 'm not doing right by him . If you let go of your anger , you 're afraid you 'll lose him forever ? So you 've held on to it this entire time ? I feel it slipping away , but ... then I look at you , and I see you killing him . You took my brother away from me . We 've been here for I don 't know how many years . Together . I 've changed . I 've repented . { \ * I 'm never gonna } I 'll never hurt anyone ever again . And all this time , you were afraid to let me out . I 'm not that guy anymore { \ * , Peter } . You know that . I know . I know you 're not . How long has it been , really ? Half a day , maybe . It feels like we were in there for years . Does that make it any less real ? Let 's { \ * go } save Emma . Sorry to break up the love fest , but { \ * I 'm here to } I 'll make sure { \ * that } that doesn 't happen . { \ * There 's } No signal . - You all right ? - Yeah , you ? Here , help me get these ropes off . Is that a lantern over there ? - We 're buried . - How far down do you think we are ? I don 't know . It felt like we dropped 40 or 50 feet . Can anybody hear us ? Help ! Can anybody hear us ?

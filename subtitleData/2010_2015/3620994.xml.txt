 Previously on Dollhouse : Sorry , sister . I stay , we both get nabbed . Don 't leave me . I was her best friend . This is what I got for it . This is my gift from Caroline . And you said this time he took all of Caroline 's imprints ? Yeah . Where 's her original self ? - You have a backup ? - This was the backup . Alpha mapped his entire brain . I 'll try and piece it back together . You made me a doll ? Then why do I feel like myself ? You are , but it 's an imprint . There 's only one place for a doll - as irreparably damaged . - The Attic . They say it 's whatever hell you imagine . This is your worst nightmare ? This is the shape of things to come . We got it ... the information we were looking for . I know how to get at the heart of Rossum . We 're ready . It 's time for me to meet Caroline . Hey , not-not this one . Aw , come on . You said you 'd give me the tour . Okay , well , here it is , all right ? It 's just like any other office . Can I have my key card , please ? I want to take you to the roof . Why are you so nervous ? Whose office is it anyway ? It 's nobody 's . Look , nobody 's got a bar ! Come on , you want to get me fired ? No . I want to get you fired up . You know , we really shouldn 't be doing this . Come on . But I ... I mean , just in here . You said you dummied up the security feed . No , I know , it 's just that I , you know , I just don 't want to leave any DNA . Then don 't make me bleed you . Well , hey . What are you doing ? What I came here to do . Oh , God , you 're ... you 're a thief ? I let a thief into the building ? Relax . I 'm not a thief . I 'm a terrorist . Oh , I am so screwed . The woman who works here ... what do you know about her ? Nothing . I don 't know anything . I work for a security company . I 'm practically a temp . Rossum 's not going to give a temp full access to one of their buildings . Well , hello , Carrie-at-the-prom . Off-the-chart smart . Bet you could kill me with your brain . What makes you a priority ? Full scholarship . What 's in Tucson ? I don 't know . Please , just put all this stuff back . What the hell is this ? I have no idea . But that can 't be in this building . Then let 's bring down the building . See what 's underneath . Who are you ? Caroline ? Yes . We need to know what she knows . Clyde said there was one person who had seen his partner face-to-face , and that was Caroline . She can I.D. the man in charge . Or the woman . Or hermaphrodite . Say , can we get back to the part where the chair-less imprinting tech that I designed , which you handed over to Harding in order to get the swank office back ... how that leads to the apocalypse ? 'Cause I thought that was kind of an interesting detail . It doesn 't matter where the tech comes from . We have to do more than disrupt production . As long as Clyde 's partner is still out there , Rossum will go on . We have to cut the head off the snake . And Caroline 's the only one who 's ever met that snake . She 's been behind the curtain . Now we need for her to take us there . Well , what if she won 't ? I mean , you 're impressive ; you are . You 're carrying multiple constructs . And something in you has allowed you to fuse them into a kind of super ego . But Caroline isn 't just one more personality build you 'd be adding to the mix ... she 's real . Echo is real . You 're damn right she is . Ivy 's right . We actually don 't know what dumping Caroline into Echo 's brain will do . Your original self comes home to find the house party that 's going on inside your head ... she might fight back . She 'd lose . All right . Pull Caroline from the vault . Put Echo in the chair . Is that really necessary ? It 's just a precaution . And not an unwise one . Unlike the rest of you , I 've actually met Caroline . Are you okay ? I 'm good . We haven 't really talked since you ... died . I guess we 've both died since then . Yeah . Weird week . So are you finally ready to meet the girl who started all the trouble in your life ? What ? Janice Charles from my fourth grade math class is here ? Okay . We 're all set . All we need now is ... Caroline . Where 's the wedge ? Gone . What ? ! Caroline 's missing . - Obviously clueless . - Well , she is clueless . She 's at my party . The be-atch comes up to my boyfriend ... And you looked so hot . I mean ... - I looked so good . - Amazing . - You looked really good , too . - Thank you . Excuse me . Are you finished ? Huh ? Oh , yeah . You can take those . So I was like , " You 've got to be kidding me , " and she was like , " No , I 'm not . " Okay , be-atch . I am not a waitress . Huh ? I 'm not a waitress . I 'm just another person standing here with a tray . So , I was like , " You go anywhere near him ... " It 's very crowded , and you ladies are taking up four spaces . Also , you appear to be finished . Yeah , well , we 're not finished . I mean , does it look like we 're finished ? Um , yes , I just said that . Oh , God , was that the bisque ? Did you have the bisque ? 'Cause I had the bisque , and ... Ew ! It 's coming up again ! Oh , God . Love your bag . Take the table . Care to join me ? You 're not ill ? No . See , the mistake you made was trying to reason with them . But I find that even rude people don 't like to barfed on . I imagine that 's true . Caroline Farrell . Bennett Halverson . So I 'm just going to guess . Neuroscience major . How did you know that ? Fish . Brain food . Also brain books . Of course . I 'm an idiot . And a genius , probably . Technically . And you ? Not a huge genius . I meant , what are you studying ? I 'm still trying to pin it down . I see all the things they have to offer , and I figure once I settle on one thing , I 've excluded everything else . And there are a lot of things I 'd like to be . Oh , no , no , no , no . Get that thing out of my face . It 's for the video yearbook . Okay , hi , Mom . Are we done ? Anyone else you want to say good-bye to ? Dieter and Meg . Oh , and the girls of Sigma Tau . Sister 's forever . Let 's hope those venereal diseases ... She seems so innocent in a way , doesn 't she ? Unspoiled . Yes . She wasn 't , you know . Caroline Farrell left quite a trail of unhappiness in her wake and not a few bodies . Are you saying she 's evil ? Worse . An idealist . - And I want to travel . - I shouldn 't be at all surprised if it turned out her wedge had got up and walked out of here on its own . I was glad when I heard it was missing . It 's only natural . But I didn 't take it . I only considered it briefly . What can I say ? I want to do everything . Is that too much to ask ? Why would Echo steal her own imprint ? Because she 's become a real girl . And if Caroline were to come back , she might cease to exist or wind up nuts or very confused . Okay , but it doesn 't track . Echo went to the Attic for the cause . Whatever that does to your brain is worse than getting a roomie . Now , this is just Rossum being five steps ahead of us again . We 're there . Harding was running this place for months . His people were everywhere . Rossum could have had them grab the wedge at any time . We have ignition . Ghost chair 's just been engaged . Let 's do this . After Apollo 's accomplished bring Cassandra down for a full diagnostic . She 's been complaining about ... That 's wrong . Something 's happening . Something unintended . Not ... not unintended ... intentional . Cancel this imprint . This imprint 's been corrupted . Corrupted from the outside . School pranks . This reeks of Topher Brink . We 're in . She 's here . We got her . Is she okay ? Is she still cute ? Don 't you hurt her . Gingersnap . What is this ? What are you doing ? I 'm taking you to see an old friend . Paul . We 're not leaving yet . And the flight ... not too exhausting , I trust ? You used the company jet to abduct the programmer of a rival House . I 'm certain I 'll be kicking myself come holiday bonus time . I 'm sure you 'll be dead by then . It 's a very open space . Quite a lot of beige . You let them roam . They roam like free-range chickens . We keep ours more like veal . Bennett ? Hi . Welcome . You routed through an I-09 to seize control of my chair . Impressive . Topher here is going to explain why we 've gone to such lengths to procure your services . You won 't be getting my services . But you ... you don 't even know what we ... what we need yet . Oh . Oh , I don 't care . This man assaulted me . Struck me in my own lab . I 'd like to file a formal complaint . Ms. Halverson , as you correctly noted , you have been abducted . Now , you could be treated as a prisoner or as a guest . It 's entire ... Can I get you anything ? A diet soda . I have some ! I mean , in my fridge . Come on . Well , lab 's in here . You showed me yours . Let show you mine . I can ... I 'm all right . How long do you think before they track her back here ? Sooner than I 'd hoped , I 'm afraid . Damn romantic fools . I 'm surrounded by them . He couldn 't just leave her there . No , I suppose not . But I had hoped for an outward appearance of normalcy while we marshaled our forces . However , any good battle plan must be fluid . We 'll be going into full lockdown mode . You did a good thing . Did I ? She walked away from me , and I let her . I never looked to see if she was okay . She was a person , and now she 's ... nothing again . We 'll fix it . We 'll make her right . Once they 've done this to you ... can you ever be right again ? Imprint wedge . It 's an original personality . What happened to it ? It , uh ... got damaged last year . I only kept this around to see if , as an exercise , I could restore it . You know ? Like you did with the Hamilton wedge . You heard about that ? That was legend . Thing is , I still have no idea which decompression algorithms you used to recover the imprint . The Hamilton wedge was only missing half its data . That 's a one to two compression ratio . This is only one to four . An exponential increase . Failed test pins ... microcracks in the spindle , mag comp corruption ... Why do you need this one restored ? Uh ... Would it sound OTT if I said this could help prevent the end of civilization as we know it ? I would need to understand the context . You could use perceptual coding to reassemble the autonomic functions , I suppose . How much data loss would we suffer ? One generation . No loss . Every memory will be intact . Awesome . Then maybe we could work on the one memory I 'd like to erase . Bennett ... I 'm so sorry I hit you . I didn 't want to . God , how I didn 't want to . Well , I was trying to kill your Active at the time . Eh . You had your reasons . Still ... that face . Slugging it . Not my first instinct . Oh , I didn 't think it was . Some form of contact , but not ... Who 's on that wedge ? Huh ? Who are you trying to resurrect ? Uh ... This person . It 's stupid . Does it ... does it matter ? It might . It 's not like it 's Stalin or somebody . I didn 't suppose that it would be a historical figure . Who is it ? Ready for your treatment ? I think I changed my mind . No mind changing . Come on . Back in the chair . Is it so bad right now ? Oh , it 's not bad . It 's just ... dull . We 're going to make you pop . I 'm not , I 'm not sure I wish to pop . You 're gonna pop . And like it . In the chair . Lay back . All right . You 're starting a big new job tomorrow . You want to turn heads . I 'll mostly be studying them , and-and there 'll be rat heads . Well , you want to look nice for your vermin . They 're largely color blind , though they can detect some ultraviolet . Then they 'll love this . The purple 's really going to bring out your eyes . Close them . I 'm kidding . This is your color . What your color should be . You 'll still be you ; just more you . I 've often thought I 'd like to be less me . More like ... Well , you , actually . Me ? I 'm still undeclared . You know who you are . You 're so fearless . I 'd love to get a look at your amygdala . You 'd have to buy me dinner first . No one 's ever done this for me before . Washed your hair ? Taken an interest . Hey . It 's me . I 'd have called . I don 't trust the land lines right now . DeWitt 's ordered the House into full lockdown . I think it 's time we brought you in . Do we get to have one drink first ? Are you scared ? Not anymore . Aww . What did you do ? Her left arm may be dead , but she 's got a terrific right cross . If anyone asks . Actually , if anyone asks , don 't say I got beat up by a one-armed girl . What did you do to him ? Him ? Him who ? Paul . I gave him his life back . You made him a Doll . I had to reconstruct his neural landscape based on the brain scans Alpha made when he damaged it , but ' s still Paul . Same taciturn , self-regarding guy . No , he 's not the same . He 's different . Half his brain tissue was scarred . I had to do major rewiring , which required healthy brain tissue . There were two pieces of real estate big enough for the job . The motor cortex or the cingulate gyrus . So either he could live his life trapped in a paralyzed body , or I could take away something else . Me , wasn 't it ? Not his memories of you . He 's still got those . Our connection . I think so . The freshest , brightest paths ... Those are the ones I needed . I think that was you . Yeah . You 're still bleeding . Why don 't you let me do that ? Dr. Saunders ? Hop up . Tilt your head back . How did you ... You mean ... You two ? Wait . Less talking would mean less bleeding . And I mean that in so many ways . So you 're the reason Boyd 's been all tardy and sleepy the last two months . Glad you 're back . You might not be . Topher , that troublesome on e-armed creature ... - where is she ? - I had to lock her up . Couldn 't leave her in the Lab unattended . And your charm offensive ? Mostly just offensive . When Dr. Saunders is finished with you , come and see me , please . Right-o . Dr. Saunders . I try to be my best . Of course you do , my dear . Try and have her back on rotation as soon as is practicably possible . She is , after all , our Number One . Ma 'am , a word ? Three months ago , someone deleted a substantial portion of security footage from the system . Three months ago ? Not our system . The main building . I only learned of it recently . And ? I spoke to the security officer on duty that night . He admitted to it . Freely ? Loudly . There was some pleading . Turns out he let a young woman into the building . Your office , to be exact . I 'll ask Judith to inventory my files . I already did . Two were missing . One of them was Caroline Farrell 's . The security officer identified her as the woman he let in . Thorn in my side , that girl . I thought we 'd finished with her . She 'd dropped off the radar . You said there were two files missing ? The other one was Bennett Halverson 's . Damn . Halverson is one of Rossum 's rising stars . Rumor has it , the man at the top selected her himself . Guess who 's rooming with Bennett Halverson at Tucson Tech ? Who else knows about this ? Just us . Keep it that way . We need to get to Tucson . Benster . You 're home early . They were doing routine maintenance at the lab . Oh . You broke out the Tasty Couture . Good choice . You said it was okay for me to borrow it . Yeah , totally . Rock on . I kind of got it for you . Is something wrong ? I wasn 't snooping . I just ... went into your closet to find the outfit . Who are you ? Bennie . Who are you ? ! I 'm Caroline . You know me . No , I don 't think I do . Where did that file come from ? L.A. The Rossum office in L.A. Why do you have it ? Because I took it . And it led you to me ? I saw you were valuable to them , which means you 're valuable to me , yeah . You wanted to get close to them ? To hurt them ? A lot . Bennett , Rossum is out of control . They 're doing things , experiments not just on animals . If you 'd seen what I 'd seen ... I thought you were my friend . I am . Then why won 't you let me help you ? You 're not ... pissed because I used you ? I 'm hurt that you won 't . Do you want to blow up a building ? Hey , stud . Mother always wanted me to date a doctor . Yeah . I wonder what mine wanted . Guess we 'll find out . It 's scary , isn 't it ? We need Caroline . We need you . I keep thinking there is a me , that I 'm real , but every time I talk to someone , they act like I 'm doing tricks . Paul never believed Echo was a person even when he cared . Now he 's just waiting for Caroline to kick me out . That 's never gonna happen . Look , I never met Caroline Farrell . I know she drives DeWitt about as crazy as you do , so I figure she can 't be all bad . But I know you . I 've watched you grow . I 've watched you build yourself from scratch against all odds . Against us . You 're stronger than everyone here , Echo , even Caroline . If she gets in there , I think she 'll be proud to know you . Okay , I have to put the House on lockdown . You gotta do that now ? Yeah . Orders . Give me three minutes . I 'm glad you have found something for us . We were starting to feel like a couple of fifth wheels . What do you need us to do ? I need you to get the hell out of here . There 's time . Probably not much but some . I don 't want you spending it here . I don 't understand . Look at her . Understand ? We 're about to go to war . You never know what you 're gonna lose in a war . You never know what you 're gonna lose anyway . Go . Be with each other even if it 's just for the night . Thank you . Guys ... if you somehow forget the way back here , that 's okay , too . Clyde 's dead . Rossum 's on to you . They 're coming ... He said they 're on to us . Probably headed this way . This could alter our plans considerably . Okay , am I the only one thinking we 're getting maybe a little too much of our intel from The Matrix or possibly Tron , given the outfits ? We 'll assume the information is good . We 'll begin evacuation procedures at once . Every Active to be brought to imprint , their original personality restored , then released . We can dispense with the niceties . I 'm not leaving behind a House full of helpless creatures . Behind ? Where are we going ? Tucson , obviously . These are the labs with restricted access . Then those are the targets . You sure you 're up for this ? We 're in it together , right ? Till the end . Go . I 'll do my work from here . You should be above the first lab by now . Copy . The charge is in place . Ten minutes on the clock ? First charge is hot . No backing down now . Caroline ? I 'm above a lab just past the L junction . It 's not in the schematic . Set the last charge and move on . The only reason you build a room that 's not in the plans is to hide something . I 'm going in . You don 't have time ! Caroline ! When you get curious , you get dead . Caroline ? Do you read ? * La donna Ã ¨ mobile , qual piuma al vento ... * Caroline ? ! * Muta d 'accento ... * Bennett , we have to abort ! What ? ! There are people in here ! You can 't ! The timers are set ! I have to try and pull the detonator caps ! You have to run ! Help me ! Run ! I won 't ! Run ! Run ! He was in there too long . He 's going into shock . - We need to get him to a hospital . - That 's not possible . My entire support staff are engaged in the evacuation . Evacuate him . He risked everything to get his message to us . Put him back in the Attic . It 's his best hope . No . No , you bitch . I 'd rather die . Well , I 'd rather you didn 't . See that it 's done . Let me take him . It 's done , Mr. Ballard ! She 's right . His best chance is back in the Attic . And we could use someone on the inside when we hit the mainframe . I don 't know you anymore . I know . Uh , Mr. Ballard , do you recall your former neighbor Mellie ? Paul ? You insisted she come along . I insist she be someone who trusts you entirely . We shan 't have time for any senate subcommittees . Paul . What 's happening ? Is this place what I think it is ? Yeah . Are you taking it down ? We 're taking it down . And you found her ? You 're Caroline . He never gave up , you know . He never stopped looking . I know . Mr. Ambrose ! What a lovely late night surprise . Are you surprised , Adelle ? Surprised and delighted . He doesn 't look surprised . He 's paid not to look surprised . What can I do for you ? You can go with these gentlemen . They 'll escort you to your debriefing . As of this moment , I 'm taking over this House and liquidating the inventory . I beg your pardon ? Let 's not play games . Nobody comes out of the Attic , Adelle . There 've been multiple breaches . You 're done . Take her . I don 't think so . Well , I guess we can agree this carpet 's done for . Mr. Langton ! Bennett ? ! Bennie ? I can 't move ... move this stone ! What are you doing ? You were working late . The building was attacked . They 'll find you . You 'll be fine . No , you can 't leave me ! I 'm with you ! You 're not . Don 't leave me ! Sorry , sister . I stay , we both get nabbed . And I 'm gonna make sure it 's just me . Don 't leave me ! Caroline ! You 're gonna bring her back . I don 't think so . No , you 're going to . Or what , you 'll hit me ? I considered that . I also considered letting you go . I don 't want her back any more than you do , but the fact is , I need her . I need what 's in her head . And I need you to get it . I 'll make you an offer : you resurrect Caroline Farrell long enough for me to save my friends , and I 'll let you do anything you want to her . I will hold the bitch down . Deal ? Are you out of your mind ? No , but Ambrose is . You think a ranking Rossum board member would confine his consciousness to a single body ? When he finds out you 've killed him , you 'll be a target . How 's he gonna find out ? I 'm going to tell him . Which is why you 're going to run . To draw their fire . It is a war . Yes , it is . Claire ? She should stay with the group . She 'll be marginally safer . Thanks . Thank me later . Gary Walden . Hey , Gare ! What do you know ? Term 's up ! You 're done ! Has it been five years ? Yeah , sure , sure . Sanderson here is going to see you make it back into the real world okay . You got a cigarette ? Five years , huh ? Wow . Yeah , so fast . Wow . Seems like I just got here yesterday . Last Tuesday , actually . Okay . That all of them ? One more . You change your mind ? Turns out Echo and I share some common interests . Give me a hand ? I 'll give you both . That wasn 't a reference . I 'm going for a walk . Thanks for grabbing these . Where will you go ? I don 't know yet . I 'll have to figure that out on the move . Somewhere they can 't pinpoint me . Where is that ? I don 't know . And I wouldn 't tell you if I did . Echo 's already in danger . I don 't want you to be . It 's an understatement to say they have ways of making you talk . Maybe I 'll just keep moving . I 'll be okay . You won 't be able to go to the hospital if you need it . Some extra bandages if you have to rewrap it . I 'm feeling fine , Claire . And you 'll need these to fight off infection . Fever is the first sign ... Claire ! I 'll be okay . I wish we had more time . I know . I 'll come back for you . - You understand ? - Yeah . I 'll come back for you . We are now officially evacuated . Topher , I 'm going to go in the back and deal with the burn racks . Take a message . You 're using nonlinear transformation for all the cognitive controllers . Yes , I am . If you had a Dewey pin , this might go a little faster . Sure . Ow . I 'm sorry . Ow . I 'm sorry . Ow . Ow . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Ow , ow , ow . I 'm sorry . Ow . Ow . Ow . I 'm sorry . More of that if we prevent the end of the world ? Yes . You know , I always had a crush on you , even when I thought you were a dude . This is better . He 's in love with you . I 'm sorry ? Claire . Claire Saunders . I was the House doctor . I used to be Number One . Oh . I see . Yes . Topher mentioned there had been ... It 's nice to meet you . Is that Caroline ? Mm-hmm . Do you really think you 're going to be able to get her back ? I 'm confident of it . Do you really think he likes me ? I didn 't say " likes . " He 's remarkable . I honestly didn 't think he was capable of admitting the existence of another human being , let alone loving one . I think you 're the remarkable one . I couldn 't find a Dewey pin , but ... Do not move . You have much to answer for , young woman . I do ? You forced me to come to Arizona . I loathe Arizona . We taking her back to the House ? I don 't think she 's left us with much alternative , Mr. Dominic . Yes ? Of course , sir . I wouldn 't dream of keeping her from you . Someone upstairs wants to meet you . Who ? The head of the company you just tried to blow up . You weren 't invited ? No hard feelings , darling . A trip to see our director is generally one-way . Enjoy the ride . Topher . Topher ? Topher , I need you to focus . Topher ! Saunders did this . Rossum got to her . Probably months ago , right after she left this place . A sleeper ? Yeah . Boyd loves her . He 'll have to adjust . I 'm going after her . Or not . Topher ? We ... we can bring her back . We can bring Bennett back . We can bring ... we can map ... There 's nothing left to map . The person who we need to bring back now is Caroline . Can you do it ? Good . Okay . I can do this . I can do this . I got it from here . You get your chance , you slip out . In the real world , you can write your ticket anyplace you land . I really do want to help you . Then live . You have a remarkable brain . I think it should stay in your head . Ivy . Don 't become me . Go . Go ! We 're breached . That 's one word for it . This won 't do it . I was loading the weapons reserve cache up in the handlers ' quarters . Go ! How long ? This is going to take just as long as it 's ... done . Where the hell is security ? Assume they 're dead . Let 's do this . Damn . I just had that replaced . You should go . Server room service tunnels . Don 't be ridiculous . You 're our general . We can 't lose you . Good luck , all of you . Stay back ! I 've imprinted myself with many useful skills . You don 't even want to know . Hang in there . Someone upstairs . Mistakenly let a woman in . Caroline 's the only one who 's ever met that snake . Enjoy the ride . Hello . Hi . Hey , thanks for coming up . It 's , uh , terrific . Can I get you something ? Tea ? I hate tea . Okay . So , not tea , then . Wow . I mean ... Look at you . Caroline Farrell . So , you 're Rossum ? Um , Rossum is ... is just a name , actually . From a play . Although , technically , it seemed to fit . Sorry . Clyde . Clyde Randolph . The second . Well , like the fifth , actually . I , uh , I use a lot of bodies . I 'll explain that later . My partner and I have been quite eager to meet you . Why me ? Because you 're very special . You 're going to help us In ways you can 't understand . Not likely . You don 't have a lot of options . So I 'm going to be one of your zombies ? Open up my brain like the rest of them ? You 'll never be like the rest of them . You won 't be harmed in any way . You 're ... far too valuable . And I 'm just gonna trust you ? With your life .

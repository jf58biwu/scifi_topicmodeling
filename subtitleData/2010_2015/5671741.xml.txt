 It 's me , Chris , don 't worry , stay in bed . - I 'll go see . - No , it might be a burglar . Call the police , maybe lock ourselves in with the kid . Please , don 't , you 'll scare him . You can understand ... No wonder he sleeps with the light on . He takes after you . At least he stopped wetting the bed . Quiet , he 'll hear us ! Did you check there 's no one in the kitchen ? Quit freaking out ! There are no aliens , as your son seems to think . My son ? He 's your son too ! Am I his father ? He 's scared of his own shadow ! He 's got his head in the clouds . He 's got no pals ! You overprotect him ! He 's a wimp ! Don 't talk to me like that ! Who do you think you are ? You 're crazy ! Let go , you 're hurting me ! It 's OK , shut it ! Fuck off , you asshole ! What are you doing ? Put it down ... put the knife down ! Yes , madam ... Madam ? You have to reboot your computer . Go into the " start " menu . See the big button on the front of the box ? Press and hold it , the screen goes dark , tell me what happens next . Why the sanctuary ? Why go to the sanctuary ? Are you crazy ? Sorry , Madam , what 's on your screen now ? Madam ? Hello , DC Assistance . How can I help ? Wi-fi connection issues ? That might not be the answer . Stand back from the computer . Have you rebooted your box ? Let 's try that first . Yes , it will cut your phone line . Call back afterwards . Fucking asshole ! Sir ? Hello ? ... Fuck ! Take that , and that ... And take yourself off too ! Take that ... and that ... And that . Now beat it ! Just get out of here . Now get out of my sight ! I 'm not on call tonight . Call Jérémie if there 's a problem . Or Superman . Quit messing about ! The boss wants me to inspect the troops , in case of magnetic interference from the comet . He wants all backups checked . Problems , are you kidding ? The comet 's nowhere near us . Just obeying orders . They don 't care where the comet is . They just want clients . Tell him to go fuck himself . From him , not me . I will , don 't worry ! ... the Eiffel Tower , right behind me . Thousands of you are trying to find the right vantage point around the Tower to observe the comet from . The other question on everyone 's lips is : What effect will the comet have ? Will the world end ? Will the sky cave in ? The comet arouses in us our deepest fears . So I 'm here to find out your plans for this evening . Some of you intend to watch the comet with the family , others are going to party . So partygoers , bear in mind that the police have strengthened security measures , so exercise caution . I 'm with Professor Dunant . Thanks for joining us . Hi , thanks for talking to me . Just how far away is the comet right now ? Opinion varies on the actual distance . As far as France goes , we can confirm that the comet will pass very close to the Earth . The Americans are saying it might skim our atmosphere , so do be careful . People are concerned . What are the possible consequences ? Well ... an astral body of this size and density will have consequences . It 's hard to say what they 'll be . It 's windy in Paris . Are we talking tsunamis and natural catastrophes ? Nothing catastrophic , no . I don 't anticipate any tsunamis , but interference will affect radios and cellphones , with frequency issues . It 's hard to say to what extent exactly . Hey ! Hey ! You OK ? Yeah , but I have to go . You 're not a local . I 've never seen you . Are you in for some ? We 've got what you need . You 'll take something , right ? - How much you got ? - Nothing . Sorry . No need to apologize . I believe you . I 'll check , though . Leave him alone . Hey , Johnny . You still around ? You 're not back in Canada ? Tabernacle ! I told you to stay away from my block . We were talking to our new pal , Johnny . Not Johnny , John . Asshole . Playing big brother doesn 't suit you . What you gonna do ? First , there 's only 4 of you . 3 ' / 2 counting the other fag . Second , I 'm in a really bad mood today . And third ... All pleased now , are you ? Playing with your new toy ? Yeah , I 'm pleased . Now beat it . Yeah , beat it , baby . Thanks , you saved my skin . Shut it , you 're doing yourself no favors . Come here , honey . Come on ! Come here . Come out of there . Come on ! Come here , honey . Come on , honey . Go on . Come here ... I knew it ! It 's coming again . A wave of fire in the sky . It 's back . - The return match . - Give me a break ! I was at the first game . A real fuck-up , believe you me ! When was it , 1986 ? That 's right . 1986 . I still had my pal Edmond . We saw them arrive . Fucking scary ! But we fought . Fought like mad dogs ! Edmond had a right-hand like Marcel Cerdan . And I had my iron bar . And we kicked their asses ! But it wasn 't enough . They 're back . Fuck ! Do they want more ? We know , Roger . You protect us from the Chinese , from Martians ... But you 're bothering the customers ! What clients ? This dump is empty ! On account of you ! Take it easy , he 's done nothing . Don 't worry , it 's Roger , our very own bum . We 're used to him . He 's a mascot . Are you OK ? Nice of you to ask but don 't worry about me . Worry about yourself . And the rest ! If you need a hand , give me a call . I 'm still up for it ! Go piss the competition off , bring me in some customers . Take a hike , have a shower ! Seriously . Seriously . Soft drinks ? Soda ? Isn 't that a bit ... feeble ? Tonight isn 't gonna be very rock 'n'roll , is it ? A good drink gives you a clear view of things , don 't you think ? A nice , white alcohol . Vodka . Or tequila ... tequila gold . Ever had any ? You feel it take possession of your throat , run into you , and warm you inside . It makes you want to drink ... to dance , to laugh ... to quiver ... to caress ... to hold someone ... Some like beer or wine . I don 't think that 's very sexy . Yeah , you 're right . What the fuck are you doing ? Am I hot or not ? Don 't you wanna hump me ? Anyone there ? Hi , sorry , the door was open ... The door was open , I thought maybe there 'd been a burglary . Sorry . No problem ... It got left open when I threw that asshole out . Give me a moment . Sit down . I 'm just finishing a canvas for the " Orgasmic Explosion " collection . Fancy 3 9 ° ? - No , I 'm useless . - Sure ? Really . - Maybe you have hidden talents . - Very well hidden ! So you broke into my flat ? No , the door was open ... To spy on me . Know what I mean ? You were peeking at my ex on the landing . I know , I could sense it . Am I wrong ? Yeah , I heard you . Well , I saw you . I 'd have done the same . It 's exciting , seeing people argue . So , was I convincing ? Convincing ? As the girl , crushed by her boyfriend 's two-timing . - You mean it was ... - An act , yes . I 've been trying to dump him for weeks . Spends all day playing on-line video games . Yeah , I know the type . Beer ? No beer but this is better . Oh , I don 't know ... No , you 're staying . Take those three . We need a toast . To world peace . OK .. let 's drink to me , to you , to freedom , encounters ... and the end of the world . Wanna watch the comet with me ? No , I 'll be asleep tonight . - You 're not into it ? - Not really . I love stuff like that . What Stuff ? Stuff you can 't understand . It 's exciting . So a big rock flying overhead ... A comet ... it 's a comet . Rocks don 't fly at 60 kmlsec through space . 60 kmlsec ? How do you know ? They said so on the news . Well , every time a comet comes , they say it 'll kill us . What a way to go ! Anyway the Incas - or was it the Mayas ? - predicted it . All the two-bit preachers and gurus say we 're going to die too . Yeah , this guy in the grocery store earlier ... Some weirdo talking about an invasion . But he was really into it . Really convincing . It kind of freaked me out . Say ... you 're not scared , are you ? Oh no . If there was a problem , I hope you 'd protect me . Yeah , I won 't let you down . I 'm a real freak exterminator . - What 's your name ? - Chris . You know , I left the door open so you 'd come in . Really ? Seriously . I saw you around and wanted to meet you . Well , it worked ! No , I 'm kidding you . The door thing was an accident . A lucky break . Fancy going to the apocalypse party in the next block tonight ? - Me ? - No , not you . Your cheerful twin . I don 't know those people . You could be my date . I 'll wear a white dress and crystal slippers for the end of the world ! Come on , I 'd really like you to . OK . By the way , I 'm Claire . No , she 'll think you 're a loser ! Several people have been injured in an accident on the Champs-Elysées . Driving on the wrong side of the road , a car ploughed into several vehicles and pedestrians before crashing into a store . Emergency services are at the scene . 15 people are injured , 3 of them seriously . Could the comet be linked to the unrest in Paris and its suburbs ? The question is a valid one . Since this morning , there has been a spate of thefts , attacks , and even suicides . Although police have increased security , it appears they are overwhelmed . Military intervention has been mooted . The Interior Minister urges people to remain at home and avoid crowded places . It really is the apocalypse . Come and save me ! Excuse me , young man . Do you know anything about astronomy ? I can 't figure it out . Please ... There . Yeah ! Hugo , the gentleman found you the comet . Thanks . How did you do that ? Is it your job ? Are you an astronaut ? A spaceman ? Cosmonaut ? No , I used to stargaze with my dad . That 's nice to hear . Moments like that together leave their mark on kids . Isn 't your dad coming ? No , I 'm busy right now . Are you gonna do what they 're doing ? It 's rude to point , Hugo . Now listen up . Try to find me the Great Bear and the North Star . Go on . Just one thing ... The kid 's right . It 's an amazing night for dinner with a friend , male or female . - Dad , I 've caught the Great Bear ! - Really ? Yeah , great ! It 's beautiful . Now listen . When you observe the stars , you realize how tiny you are in this immenseness . The sky is huge ! That 's beautiful , isn 't it ? Look at the stars ! Hi ! Oh dear ! You look like you need a drink . What is it ? Something to help you face an apocalypse . Not the party , the actual end of the world . So ... do you know anyone here ? You look lost . I 'm looking for a friend . Claire . Claire ? Like me ! Only kidding . No , I 'm Laure . But call me Claire , I like it . What does your girlfriend look like ? No , she 's my neighbor . She 's beautiful . Tall , blonde , sexy ... Hard to miss . Yeah , I know her . The famous Claire . She left already . And she wasn 't alone . Sorry . You OK ? You need some water ? Fresh air ? Light ... I need light . I don 't know ... maybe the bathroom ? Feeling better ? I thought you were gonna faint on me . Not that I 'd mind . On the contrary . Right ... might as well use the bathroom while I 'm here . Otherwise the end of the world will come early for me ! There you are . You 're a pretty slow hero . Sorry I 'm late . Did you miss me ? Guess . I 'm not here for the comet . What a show . Yeah , it 's impressive . Aren 't you drinking ? You wanna get me drunk ? Very funny . No , that first drink didn 't agree with me . Yeah ... the Inca told me he 'd spiked the cocktail . I 'd rather not know what with . You 're so delicate ! No , my medication doesn 't mix with alcohol , so ... God , I 'm drunk ! - What were you saying ? - Nothing . Yes , you were ... Come and tell me . You 're on medication ? - Yeah , stuff . - What stuff ? Sleeping pills ? Yeah , for sleeping , and other things . You 've started so you 'd better finish . Supposing you had anxieties . Real ones that stopped you sleeping . Or living . I 've had them . I couldn 't bear to see paintings of myself . I made myself sick ... in every sense . With me , it 's the dark . The dark ? I flip at night , when there 's no light . I get anxiety attacks , so I take medication . So now ... I 'm making a superhuman effort . So here 's the lovely one . - Ready for the sacrifice ? - I 'm ready . I 'll be right back . Switch all the lights on . Anyone there ? Laure ? They 're here . Are you OK , Laure ? It 's me . Fucking shit ! C 'mon , connect ! Fuck it ! Open up , fuck it ! What 's that ? No idea . It 's coming from up there . - Can 't you ... ? - Shut it ! - This is it ... - Shh ! Shut up . - Help ! - Fucking light ! Open the door . Please ! Let 's split . Maybe he knows something . Could be another psycho . I know you 're out there ! - What did he say ? - People are in danger ! What was that ? It 's here . Fuck , I can 't do this . - My brother 's dead , let 's go ! - You 're alive , now shut it ! Bet he 's shitting himself . Maybe you should be . I know I am ... Let 's split ! Split ? Have you seen what 's outside ? Just grab some weapons and shut your fucking mouth ! - Got any food in there ? - Sure . Weapons ? I got what it takes . You need it round here . OK , back away from the door . Don 't move ! - Hey , I know you . - Shit . Don 't say anything . Get up . Come on ... come on ! - Not bad . Did you do this ? - No . They set about me , then I don 't remember a thing . You 'll do . Who ... who did this ? Who the fuck did it ? Ah , there 's your answer ! - Here they come . - Who ? Are you kidding ? It 's a total fuck-up out there . Come on . Wait , my camcorder ... What the fuck are you doing ? You wanna die ? Come on ! There . Careful ... So what do you do ? I 'm a ballet teacher . Ballet teacher ... You 're Canadian ? Are we done with the dumb questions ? Good . Bad news . What ? Staying here is suicide . We have to go outside . This is a fucking nightmare . I 'm gonna wake up . I have to find Claire ... No , sit down . Fuck ! At least it 's disinfected . Swallow that . What is it ? A magic pill . You 'll need it . A few glugs of this ... Puts hairs on your balls . Look at that . Now listen up . This is very important . We 're going outside . Stick with me . No more Mr. Nice Guy , Mr. Justin Bieber . We charge into them . No messing about , no hesitation . Women , children ... Fuck ! Yes , children . No time to test whether they 're 20 % , 50 % or 70 % human . We kill them , all of them . - Deal ? - Yes . Rock ' n ' roll ... Let 's go . MY bag , please . Thanks . I 'd rather you didn 't take that , it was my son 's . Grab a gun . - Can you shoot ? - No . Take something else . We have no option , we have to go down . Stick close to me . Sir ... are you OK ? Sir ? Help me . Help me ! Help yourself . Who are you ? He asked for help , he was alive ! So which part of him was human ? Look , kid , are you with me or against me ? Make your mind up . Fuck ! Give me that . Fuck ! Hope you 're not scared of the dark . Rock ' n ' roll . Good ... follow me . Shit ! Come and help me . Wait ... Let me breathe . Fuck . Still got your toy ? I might be the only human being left that you will fight you could make an effort , Johnny . For you , I 'll give you the honor . Motherfucker . Shit . Well done . Turns out you 've got balls after all . I 'll take that ... shit ! Are you OK ? I 'm fucked . Shit , what 's this ? For me anyway . - Now beat it . - What ? Beat it ! Go on . Good luck . Don 't look at me . Don 't look at me ! Claire ? Claire ? Claire , no , that 's not the answer . Come here . I 'll get something for you . I only found this ... Chris ! What have I done ? Chris , forgive me ... I 'm so sorry . Dad ! Mr. Astronaut ! - Are you OK ? - Stay away from me ! Stop ! We need help . - What are you doing here ? - We were attacked . - Are you alone ? - Yes , they 're all dead . What about him ? He 's lost a lot of blood , he needs help . Get in . We 'll help you . Do what you can to keep him alive . Are you kidding ? He needs to be saved ! You mean you won 't help us ? - Stop that ! - No sudden movements ! How 's it going ? Where is he ? Take this gun and fucking fight ! Don 't worry , it 's nearly over . Subtitles : Kevin Smith Subtitling : Vdm

 Previously on Alphas ... Agent Sullivan just called . We have an Alpha missing- - Skylar Adams . Skylar 's smarter than just about anyone . She was always inventing things . Are you looking for my mommy ? I was going to head out to , uh--to the coffee shop . Are you asking me out on a date ? If we 're gonna try this , we 're gonna need to take it slow . Slow is good . [ Screams ] Dr. Rosen ... Cornell Scipio . [ Machine whirring ] - Is that a photic stimulator ? - There 's 42 different models . You remember the young woman who built you your phone ? - Yeah , Skylar . - Do you still have it with you ? She said I could call her on this . She might be the one to figure out how this thing works . Identities of all volunteers remain classified . The purpose of the study is to test reactions to various frequencies of light oscillation . Project Bluebird , Artichoke , Paper Clip- - you believe these names ? These Cold War programs were the government 's first attempts to explore the limits of the human neurological system . And one of the more promising experiments was photic stimulation- - visual stimulus to alter brain activity . But as you can see , some pretty horrible results . I still don 't get the connection to your toy here . You said they use this to treat people for epilepsy and Parkinson 's and lazy eye syndrome . Well , Bill , Stanton Parish somehow managed to coerce Senator Burton to fast-track this particular device through the FDA . I seriously doubt he was concerned with lazy eye syndrome . So you had Kat take this thing apart . She couldn 't find anything . Yeah , but why ? Why , Bill , was it used so deliberately on that Jason Miller kid in the hospital ? It enhanced his Alpha ability , which put you and the rest of the team in danger . Thousands of these are due to be distributed right now . I 'm convinced that this- - this--well , whatever it is- - is a crucial part of Parish 's war plans . And I hate to think what will happen if I can 't figure out what it does . Well , whatever it is , Nathan Cley needs this on his desk tomorrow morning , okay ? That is evidence . Yeah , well , it 's not going to be on Nathan Cley 's desk tomorrow morning . It 's going to be on Skylar Adams 's . If anyone can figure this out , it 's her . [ Loud sizzling ] [ Loud smacking , chewing ] You know , I checked . Health inspectors eat here . I 'm so sorry . It 's- - it 's a force of habit . Oh . You know what ? I should get going . You 're really not gonna tell me where you 're going ? Dr. Rosen 's being really paranoid about security . You know I 'm head of tactical , right ? Your boss is making it really hard for me to do my job . Do you want to come along to protect me ? That 's sweet . Look , I just- - Both : I 'm sorry . - No , no- - No , John , I 'm sorry . I- - I 'm trying , okay ? And we 'll get there , but ... I got to go . Dr. Rosen , why do I have to go ? I don 't want to go . I don 't like going places . Gary , you 're part of the team . And I want everyone doing security . No , but Bill- - he does the security . 'Cause Bi- - Bill 's the muscle , and the muscle is in the arm . I 'm the brain , and the brain stays in the head . The office is the head . That 's my metaphor . Right , right . That 's a great metaphor , Gary , you are the brains , okay ? Yeah , well , then tell Dr. Rosen- - the brain stays in the head . Gary , when Stanton Parish finds out we have this device , he 's going to come looking for it . You are too important to be left behind . You monitor signals . No one else can do that , all right ? You 're going . Oh , okay . But then you ha - you have to appease me . [ Chuckles ] Appease you ? Okay , all right , Gary , how about you pick where we stop for lunch ? Yeah , that 's good . How about we let him drive us to lunch ? - No , no , I 'm the shotgun . - I 'm gonna let you drive . That 's fool 's gold , Bill . You never let me drive . Rachel ? - Where are you going ? - To see a guy about a thing . You gonna miss me ? No . Well , I bet I can change your mind on that . - Hi . - Hi . What , you don 't like office hours ? Sorry . The subway was late . Bentley 's in the shop ? No . The Bentley was repossessed . She couldn 't afford to make the payments . And she 's not allowed to push anyone anymore to keep the car . So Nina 's going , huh ? Yeah . Look , nothing 's gonna happen , okay ? Just trust me . It 's not you I 'm worried about . Nina 's promised to use her ability for the , uh- - for the good of all . Yeah , that 's like asking an alcoholic to only drink in the office . I need to do this myself , so I can handle it . Give her a chance , okay ? She 's trying to change . Yeah . Cameron , we need to go . Give my love to Dani . Your dad says hi . All right . I 'm the shotgun . Nothing but trees- - where are we ? Well , I think we 're almost there , Bill . I think , I think . You think ? Doc , what exactly did Skylar say ? Well , she wasn 't all that specific . No , she hung up on him . But I 'd already traced the call . She 's 3.2 miles north of Route 11 . All right , well , that 's around here , then . Yeah , it is , but it 's all- - it 's just trees . There 's trees everywhere ... At least on--on Mapquest and Google maps . When you 're this far out , you don 't want to be found . Don 't--oh , wait , wait ! Stop , stop ! [ Tires screech ] What , what ? - Gary , what are you doing ? - Gary ! Gary ! What are you doing ? It 's all gone ! There 's no wi-fi . There 's no 4g . Everything 's gone . Gary , that 's what happens when you 're out in the boonies . Can you just get back in the van , please ? This is no good . We have to turn back now . We 're not turning back , Gary . Just don 't--don 't jump out of the van again . I don 't like the boonies ! Oh , what 's this ? Hey . How you fellas doing ? Just fine . But you 're on private land . You need to turn around . Excuse me , we 're looking for a friend of ours who lives somewhere around here . Her name is Skylar Adams . Hey , D.C.I.S. Hey ! Hey ! You have to respect that badge . Give me it back . You 're feds . Get the hell out of here . Give me . - Go ! - All right . Get out of here . - Cameron , just- - - move it . Just go ahead . Look out ! [ Engine shuts off ] Whoa ! He 's an Alpha . You 're right , Gary . - What do the other two do ? - We don 't want to find out . - Hey , hey . - He opens doors . - Hey , hey , hey , back off . - Guess you 're walking . What do you think you 're doing ? - Let 's go ! - Gower ! Back off ! Hello , Skylar . Dr. Rosen . - You 're Rosen ? - Yes . Yes--yes , I am . And , uh- - and you are ? Skylar , are these folks friends of yours ? No . Neither are you . Skylar ? Go home .

I thought you weren 't with those people . Just tell me what you want . All right . Thank you , Nina . I need you to take a look at this . It appears to be a photic stimulator , but I think it 's much more than that . You want to use me for my abilities ? [ Chuckles ] I 'm shocked . Take it to the genius bar . Skylar . Skylar ... This is important . I took a tremendous risk helping you elude the NSA . I did not have to do that . Really ? You 're playing that card ? - Hey ! Over here ! - Kids , come this way ! [ Laughter ] Wait up ! So this is where you ended up- - a town full of Alphas . It 's just an old summer camp they fixed up- - a place for refugees . Refugees from what ? The neuro-typical world ... from you . You don 't look too impressed . No . With all these Alphas here , you never know who 's a Parish sympathizer . So we got to keep our eyes open . Why don 't you stay with Rosen and the machine ? And I 'll do a security check with , uh , Rachel and Gary . All right . Xenon tube , flash header ... 50-watt step-down power supply . Yeah , yeah , I know what this is . It 's a photic stimulator . Skylar , I-I know that . But t-there 's got to be more to it . Hey , look who 's here . Zoe , you remember Dr. Rosen . Hi , Zoe . - What 's this ? - Whoa . Zoe , don 't touch . Don 't touch . I 'll show you later . She never stops . This is how it always is . Zoe what 's this ? Zoe , Zoe , do you like bubbles ? Do you want to know how to blow a giant bubble that never pops ? How do you do that ? I 'll show you . Come here . Let 's just sit right here . Now the first thing you have to do , is you have to take a deep breath . And then ... blow it out slow . Here it comes . Here it comes . Here it comes . It 's getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger ... There you go . Wow . This is an amazing-looking creature . Think you could draw a picture of it for me ? Okay . Thank you . How did you do that ? I 've had a little experience raising a equally spirited one of my own . She just- - she never stops . She wakes me up at 4 : 00 in the morning to tell me she discovered a new prime number . Well , as they say , the apple doesn 't fall far from the tree . Didn 't you once take apart your family 's Volkswagen and make an air cannon or something ? It was a Nissan . Careful , careful . That , uh- - that could be dangerous . More dangerous than an air cannon ? Yeah , quite possibly . Gary , do me a favor . Try to keep your eyes in the real world , please ? No . I don 't like only being able to see the real world . It 's boring . I hate it here . Yeah , well , you know , this place reminds me of when my parents used to send me to summer camp . I hated it as well . I couldn 't sleep without the traffic noises , but after a while , you learn to appreciate a place like this . [ Sniffing ] Smell that . You smell that country air ? Oh . Bees . Oh , no . - Gary , come on , back up . - I don 't like bees , Bill . They have evil intent . Gary , wait , wait , wait . Come back . - Calm down , son . - Get off ! Get off ! Don 't let them sting you . Oh ... You can speak bee . Basically . Huh . You must be Skylar 's friends . Um , Agent Harken ? Gary ? No . Agent Bell . I 'm an Agent , too . Claude . I 'm the , uh , founder of this colony for people like us . You 're the guy I need to talk to--I 've got some questions about security arrangements around here . We all get along pretty well . We 've never had any incidents . I doubt we 'll have any now . You always want to prepare for the worst and hope for the best , right ? Oh , you 're the founder , so it 's your fault that there 's no signals here . Gary can read electromagnetic communication , so he gets a little cranky in dead zones like this- - Bill ! I 'm not cranky . You 're the cranky- - you 're always cranky . Yeah . It 's not exactly dead around here . Nature is crawling with signals , if you 're open to them . Excuse me . Okay . This is amazing . She 's actually hand-drawing algorithmic fractals . Yeah , she 's bored with those . She 's moved on to complex plane multibrots . It 's like having your own little computer running around . At least a computer comes with a manual and an " off " switch . Well , it 's not easy raising an Alpha . That 's why we 're here- - it takes a village and all that crap . Something is draining the battery . Could be a design flaw . - Dinner , dinner ! - Hey- - Thanks , Claude . Claude ... Skylar 's mentioned you . I 'm Dr. Lee Rosen . I know who you are . What 's that ? Good question . I guess I 'll be seeing you at dinner . - Uh , something I said ? - Actually , yes . That stunt you pulled letting the world know about Alphas didn 't make you any friends here . Dinner ! Come on , mommy , let 's go ! Dinner ! You can leave it . It 's safe here . No , I-I prefer to keep it with me . [ Chuckles ] Wow . You should see a shrink about those trust issues . Gary , where are you going ? What are you doing ? I 'm going back to the office ! Bill , I don 't have my things . I don 't have my pajamas or my mouth guard for the bruxism . - Gary , listen to me . - I can 't sleep without my signals . Gary , this is part of the job . We have to be on the lookout for any outside communication , anybody trying- - Oh , Bill , I told you - there are no signals . It 's not- - What ? What , someone out there ? No . Oh . What-what do you see ? It 's a star . Gary , we 're not here to look for damn stars . No , it 's good . Some stars , they- - they send out radio waves . I know that . - Gary . - It 's a pulsar . Gary , you 're killing me right now , you know this , right ? It 's pingy . Whoo-hoo . Gary . Gary ! Gary , listen to me . It 's time to eat , okay ? You 're late , okay ? You 're late to eat , Gary . Let 's--can we- - can we look at stars another time ? No , Bill , it 's not stars . It 's something else . It 's all- - it 's all- - it 's yellow and purple and--and red . And it 's- - it 's like curtains , but they 're exploding . Yeah , that sounds like the Aurora Borealis , Gary . I 've seen that in Alaska before . Huh . It 's the whole sky . Pretty amazing . You hungry , Gary ? Hey , let 's sit right here- - come on--with Hicks . I could 've killed them both . Don 't sneak up on me like that . It 's what I do . You 're so quiet , we should tie a frickin ' bell on you . Parish sent us here to observe . No one 's around--let 's just go and grab the machine . If we go for it now , they 'll know it 's valuable . We only move if they figure out what it does . What the hell is this ? See , uh , it 's a green algae . Apparently they grow their own food . Really ? Yep . Eat up . Gary , what 's the deal ? I thought we had radio silence out here . Oh , yeah . No . I-I was wrong . There are signals everywhere . I just--I wasn 't focusing hard enough , 'cause even the trees have signals , and the rocks have signals . It 's all--it 's wavelengths , but it 's smaller . It 's like- - even this food . This food has a signal . It 's go- - it sounds like , [ high-pitched voice ] Aw-wa , ba-wawawawa , ba-wawawa- - Yeah , that means " don 't eat me . " That 's what this means . [ Laughs ] - What else is there ? - ' Cause of the color . No dessert until you clear your plate , Digit . [ Chuckles ] Didge . Look at you , all domestic . You even lasered off all your tattoos . Or was that just to make it harder for the FBI to spot you ? Come on , let 's go . Rebel ... Mom . Rebel ... Mom . I thought this was a place where Alphas could be free to be themselves . Not me . I 'm here for Zoe . So what , you can 't be yourself and her mom all at the same time ? Well , right now I 'm kind of sucking at both . Trouble in the Justice League ? They 're not exactly thrilled to have me around . Maybe I should just stay here with you . That 's a load of crap . I saw you . You were happy . Made me want to throw up . Yeah , but I ruined it . And now when I 'm with them , I just feel alone . This is delicious . Honey wine . You made this ? - The bees do all the work . - Mmm . It 's human nature to exploit the special abilities of other creatures . Perhaps . But it could also be perceived as two groups working together for their mutual benefit . And when one disengages from that bond , both suffer . Have you ever had a brick thrown through your window ? Have you ever been persecuted for being who you are ? Claude , I 'm sorry , but Dr. Rosen has spent his entire career fighting against exactly that kind of intolerance- - - Rachel- - - His career ? This is our lives I 'm talking about . And we did not elect you to be our spokesman . You 're not one of us . You never will be . You 're just an outsider looking in . Yes , I 'll admit it- - I am an outsider . But let me ask you this , Claude . If you knew that your bee colonies were going to collapse no matter where you hide them , what would you do ? Wouldn 't you try to stop it ? [ Grunting ] Why 'd you come here , huh ? No ! Please , no ! [ Groans ] I can kill more than cars . Hey ! Doc ! Doc , you all right ? Yes , I think so . Easy , easy , easy . I got him . What do you know about this ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . Put those away ! We don 't solve things with violence around here . Oh , really ? Perhaps you should tell your man about that . I didn 't start this , Claude . The hell you didn 't ! You started the whole damn thing . My life fell apart because of you . My wife left me , and she took my kids , all because of you and your big mouth . Do you have a name ? - Gower . - Mr. Gower ... I opened my big mouth because it was absolutely necessary . If you 'll just let me explain- - Gower ! Go home . Claude- - You can spend the night here , but I want you gone by morning . Come on . Let 's get back to our homes . [ Birds chirping , insects buzzing ] There gonna be some way to repair this ? Well , maybe if you stop touching it . Ugh . Gower smashed this one up . I mean , we replaced the circuit boards . Hey , do you see that ? Sneaky-ass , clever bastards . What ? W-what have you found ? Control circuits . Nano-processors embedded in the wires themselves . Idiots installed it all backwards . Yeah , this photostim has definitely been tampered with . Is there any way to determine what exactly has been done to it ? - It 's gonna take some time . - We don 't have time , Skylar . Claude wanted us out of here first thing this morning . Lucky you . Hey , you know , you and Zoe can come with us . Actually , that 's a great idea . No . I brought Zoe here to be around kids like her . Every morning I wake up and wish I could leave . It was so much easier when I was alone . Hey , Zoe . Zoe . God ! Mother of the frickin ' year . Digit ! Digit ? Skylar . [ Electricity crackles ] Oh ! Ugh ! - Rachel , turn that thing off . - Yeah , okay . It 's got its own internal power source . Maybe if I reconnect it- - [ machine whirring ] Rachel ! Bill ! - Oh , my God , what happened ? - She 's having a seizure , Bill . Rachel , stay with me . Stay with me . Dr. Rosen ... Where are you ? I can 't see you . [ Echoing loudly ] I 'm right here . [ Voices echoing indistinctly ] Zoe ? Digit . Skylar . Gary , have you seen my kid ? No , but , Skylar , I 'm looking for something too . I want to get a cabin , but I want one with carpet . Everything here 's made of wood , and I like carpet , 'cause it 's all- - it 's squishy beneath my toes . I don 't have time for this . Zoe ? - Aah ! - How did that machine do that ? It 's as if that- - that instrument , whatever it is , has amplified her Alpha ability . So ... it 's like what happened to that coma kid in the hospital , right ? Yes , but whatever adjustment Skylar made to that thing has increased its potency . Rachel , Rachel , what you 're experiencing is an intensification of your own ability , which means you can probably control it . Just focus , go through your protocols . You can control this . Zoe ? [ Twigs and leaves crunching ] Zoe ! Didge ? I didn 't mean it . Didge ? Come back . Zoe ! Zoe ! [ Twig snaps ] Oh , didn 't mean to scare you . So don 't sneak up on people in the middle of the woods . Who are you ? We want that machine you fixed . It 's not mine to give . Yeah , well , it 's not the Doc 's either . See , he stole it . We want it back . - You okay ? - Yeah . - You sure ? - Yeah , fine . - Here , Rache . - I 'm okay . Just get this off of me . I can 't breathe , okay ? Just get it off of me . - Shh , shh . - Okay , just--I can 't breathe . Oh . Rachel , what 's wrong ? Oh , you look like one of the faces from my expressions chart- - j-joyless . Rachel 's sick , okay ? We 're gonna take her home , as soon as Dr. Rosen gets back with that photostim . Oh , okay , drive safe ... and really fast . I 'm gonna go and air out my cabin . - What ? - Gary , you- - your cabin ? Yeah . Yeah , number 33 . Claude said that I could live here . And , Nina , you can take your office back , 'cause I-I don 't need my man cave anymore . Gary , you 're not staying . Let 's go . Get in the van . - No , I am staying . - Shh ! Stop talking so loud ! I make up my own mind . I make my decisions . Gary , there 's no Thai food here , no Chinese , no take-out , nothing . Come on . No , you 're- - you 're trying to trick me . I told you , I-I 'm not leaving ! Oh , God . Gary ! Gary , have you seen Skylar anywhere ? - Oh . Yeah , yeah . - Where ? She went into the trees . She was looking for Zoe . I was listening to the sun . Yeah , well , if you see her , tell her I 'm looking for her . Yeah , in the--okay . Where is she ? That 's not how this is gonna work . 90,000 volts- - that 's how it 's gonna work . Where is she ? Hey , Doc . Long time no see . You 're looking good . Skylar , please don 't give Mr. Scipio that instrument . He can 't be trusted . He works for Stanton Parish . They don 't care who they hurt ! Come on , Doc , that any way to talk about an old friend ? We used to have something . - He has Zoe . - What ? Lee , you are the reason why he 's here . We were safe- - Aah ! Doc , come on , I 'm taking that bag . [ Machine beeps , whirring ] Why did you do that ? How are we gonna find her now ? We 'll find her , I promise . We have to get out of here ! Go ! Go ! We have to get to the van ! Rachel , let us know when you hear something . Stop , stop ! Stop the car ! Just let me- - just let me hear , okay ? - What , Rachel ? - Let me just listen ! [ Labored breathing ] I hear a child , breathing hard . She 's scared . There 's somebody with her . They 're indoors . All right , how far ? Where ? 1 / 4 mile , that way . Skylar , wait , wait . It 's too dangerous . - No . - She 'll be fine . - It 's my daughter . - Skylar ! [ Echoing loudly ] Skylar ! Skylar ! Aah ! Want to do your thing ? Want to let them know we 're coming ? I don 't think so . Hey , want to come do your thing ? Over on this side . That open window right up there . It 's all you , baby . Yeah . [ Hinges squeaking ] Do you smell that ? - What ? - Smell what ? It 's a fire . The forest is burning . It 's heading east , towards the camp . - That 's over a mile away . - Get in . Move . [ Floorboard creaks ] - Look out ! - Run , Zoe ! Aah ! [ Grunting ] Hey ! Hey ! Let me go ! Stand still ! Let me go ! Come here ! Stop ! [ Bones popping ] - Look , all we want is the kid . - [ Coughing ] So let me out and give me the machine . Fair trade . Can 't do it , sweetheart . You 're Hicks , right ? My sister told me about you . She said she kicked your ass at Highland Mills . That 's not quite how I remember it . Oh , yeah ? Well , you 'll remember this . - You okay ? - Do I look okay ? Get me up . Where is she ? Where 's Zoe ? - Uh , she- - - Where is she ? She 's that- - she went that way . Come on , go , go , go , go . Zoe ! Mommy 's here . [ Gasps ] Mommy ! Easy , easy . Good . You found her . Come on ! Let 's go ! Come on ! Okay . We got to get out of here , now , now ! All right . You should 've played nice . No , no , no . Get back . Back , back ! Go , go , go ! It 's okay . - Easy , easy , easy . - Don 't worry , honey . Don 't worry . [ Coughing ] There 's no way we 're gonna make it out of here ! Zoe , you stay with Hicks , okay ? I got her . [ Coughs ] I can fix this . Everybody , come on ! Hurry up ! Let 's go ! Move ! Let 's keep moving here ! [ Overlapping shouting ] What are you still doing here ? I 'm trying to help . Dr. Rosen ! - Gary ! - Dr. Rosen . My eyes are all red . I can 't see . - Go , get in the car . - Come on , come on . I 'm the shotgun . Just get in the car , okay ? Gower , go , I 've got her . I 've got her . Here you go . [ Coughing ] Claude , what can I do ? Haven 't you done enough ? I need that canister . Here you go . Okay , give me the hose . All right . Hurry . [ Valve handle squeaking ] Let me help . Okay . Here , right there . You lost 213ccs of blood . That 's 7.223868 fluid ounces . I rounded . Yeah , I 'm gonna take your word for it , kid . Take the washers . - I got ' em , here . - Okay . What else ? Make sure that connection 's tight . Will it work ? Do you know my mommy ? Zoe , come here . [ Coughs ] Come on , get out of here . - What about you ? - I 'll be fine . Just go . - Thank you ! - Go ! [ Coughs ] Hicks . Hicks ! Come on . Skylar ! Where 's Skylar ? They got out . Let 's get out of here . [ Coughing ] Oh , he 's hurt . He 's hurt . Are you okay ? Yeah , yeah . I stopped bleeding . I 'm fine . Ah , Doc , he 's bleeding . We stopped it . What happened ? We have to get him to a hospital . I 'll drive . A wildfire that broke out earlier today near White Mountain National Forest is reportedly contained , although a code orange air-quality alert remains in effect . - What are you drawing there ? - A picture of us . You 're a pretty cool kid , you know that ? I know . [ Chuckles ] Where 's the red one ? This part needs to be red . Maybe it fell . Thank you . They roll everywhere . She is very talented . Hitting on a single mom via her kid- - it 's kind of creepy . I 'm not hitting on you , Ms. Adams . You 're far too young for me . I 'm bringing you an offer . A child like Zoe--she needs an environment that she can thrive in , as do you . Who are you ? I 'm Stanton Parish . I believe you met some of my colleagues recently . I apologize for their behavior . They have the unfortunate tendency to get carried away . What do you want ? To give you an opportunity ... help make the world a better place . Isn 't that what every mother wants for her child ? - Hey . - Hey . Heard you had a rough trip . My whole world opened up . I mean , my senses ... It 's just--they got bigger than ever before . Dr. Rosen doesn 't know if I 'll ever ... go back to the way I was . I would 've brought you flowers , but ... - [ Chuckles ] - I know the smell would bother you , so ... What ? You just ... you get me . You really do . It 's weird , right ? Like , everything 's turned up so high , but ... I 'm still here . Maybe ... Cam ... You could have been killed . No . No . But if it was a couple inches up and to the right , I really might 've been in trouble . [ Chuckles ] I 'm so sorry . Hey , it 's not your fault . Yeah . No , I know . It 's just- - Besides , if I play my cards right , I just might get medical leave . You can nurse me back to health . Let me guess . You told Cley that machine got burnt up in the fire . Yes . A tragedy . [ Chuckles ] He was disappointed . One of these days , Doc , crap is gonna come back and bite you in the ass . You know that , right ? What 's on your mind , Bill ? Scipio knew that we were gonna be there . I know . Someone close to us is working with Parish . Bill , I want you to vet everyone . Cley 's office , the D.O.D. staff , families , friends , everyone , even Kat . All right , I 'll bring Hicks and Gary up to speed . No . They don 't need to know . This is just between you and me . Find this person , Bill . And when we do ? Just find him . = = sync , corrected by elderman = =

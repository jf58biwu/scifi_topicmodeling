 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Adwin Kosan , Agent Lattimer , Agent Bering . - You make the decisions . - Yes . " It breaks my heart to write this . " We both know the warehouse is my happiest place . Please forgive me , but I have to go . " Agent , Steve Jinks . I 'm really looking forward to working with you . You 're lying . We need your help . You were almost killed by an artifact . You are now officially a warehouse agent . Hey . Welcome back . Thanks . And the first guy goes , " I don 't have to outrun the bear . I just have to outrun you . " Yeah , you told me that one on the eastbound flight . No , I didn 't . All right , beginning our descent . Ugh . What the hell ? Adam , are you all right ? What 's this ? - Adam ! - How did I get here ? What 's happening to me ? I don 't know how to do this . Island Flight 687 , entering nose-down pitch attitude . What am I doing here ? Approach is no longer stabilized . Island Flight 687 . Declaring an emergency . Island Flight 687 , what 's your situation ? The world is such a scary place . The most innocent objects can cause destruction . And mayhem . A person sees enough of that , and maybe they decide they don 't want that much responsibility anymore . A person might think , walking away- - okay , not " a person . " Me . I left . " Life or death " all the time , it was too much . But as a wise and also psychotic woman recently told me , you can 't walk away from your truth . So I 'm back . Am I ready ? The " life or death " thing , it never goes away . The world is a scary place . First day back . I guess we 'll see . ♪ Warehouse 13 3x02 ♪ Trial Original Air Date on July 18 , 2011 = = sync , corrected by elderman = = Focus . Don 't get distracted by the high stakes . Concentrate on what is in front of you . And ... there 's no chair for me . Don 't freak out . It 's just a chair . It doesn 't mean that they 've moved on , or they don 't need me , or ... Here ya go , Myka . Oh , thanks . A chair , right . Yeah . Oh , Myka ! Thank goddess . Leena and I were being outnumbered by team sausage fest . - Oh ! - Oh , that 's disgusting . What ? You all eat crap for breakfast . It 's nice to finally have a healthy eater back in the group . Could we just try five minutes on , please ? Yes . Uh , Adam Ashby . Airline pilot who forgot how to fly his plane yesterday while several thousand feet over Seattle . Luckily his first officer stepped in . Now , it could 've been just a neurological event , but I don 't think it was a transitory ... Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Artie , are we gonna fly , or are we gonna drive ? 'Cause this is mm-mm ... Hmm ? Can you tell him ? He wants to know if we can go to Seattle by train , because planes are scary to him now . You still speak Pete ? Recovered , never cured . You 're gonna take a plane . You 're gonna be perfectly safe . You two go pack , and you two come with me . Hey . I was , uh- - should we ... Talk , you know , about me leaving ? Because if there 's something that you have to say to me , you can say it . No matter what it is , I can take it . Mykes , we 're double-rainbow all the way . And ... We 're back on the case . - You 're going to Boston . - These are case folders . Thank you . The auction house offering today , as one of its items , a butcher knife owned by one Mary Mallon ... - Typhoid Mary . - Who- - Excellent . Kiss-ass . You 're a child . The knife lets its owner transfer its disease or his injury to anyone . And your assignment- - go , bid , win . Go ! " Your " ? Not " our " ? No , I 'm gonna be in New Hampshire . Memorial service for a regent . She was killed in a boating accident . Awesome . I mean , not- - not for her , obviously . Very sad . But I get my own mission ? Yes . Take the new guy . Uh-huh . And who 's the senior agent ? That 'd be me . ♪ Me , me , me , me , me , me ... ♪ Uh , this doesn 't make any sense . Oh , it does when you know her better . No , no , no . Last week it was all invisible snakes , phantom knives , slam , bam , death by Shakespeare . Today you 're sending me on a- - a Fedex run for a cooking implement . I mean , isn 't there something more ... Not boring ? I 'm gonna need you to keep that attitude in check , Jinksy , as the senior agent on this mission . Oh , I 'm so sorry . Please continue your " Me dance . " Artie . Come back with the artifact and then tell me it 's too easy . Ugh . We 've never seen a case quite like this . Two days ago , this man was an experienced pilot with a degree in Aeronautical Engineering . The chart says he 's gotten worse since he came in . Yeah . Yesterday he thought he was in college . Today he 's five years old . We think it 's some sort of accelerated Alzheimer 's . And no one else he 's come in contact with has been affected ? No . And physically he 's fine , but his mind , his memory is just- - He 's slipping away . All right , kids , this is where it gets interesting . Hemostat . Wh-what 's going on ? Where--what do I- - Where am I ? Put your mask back on . - Oh , my God . I had this- - - Doctor . Doctor , you need to ... - I don 't know what I 'm doing . - Pressure 's dropping . He 's going into shock . Code blue ! We need help ! Call for help now ! We need to stabilize him . And 300 to you , sir . Looking for 400 . 400 anywhere in the room ? Looking for 400 . 400 .

No , it 's just that I thought that this job was gonna have a little more action , like what I 'm used to at the ATF- - guns and bad guys ... Guns . Right . Well , we don 't go after bad guys in our job . We go after artifacts . So if you wanna kill a bad guy , maybe find the person who made this ceramic clown . Ew ! Ohh ! Take it away . Please . Next up is item number 62- - Mary Mallon 's knife . Ooh , ooh ! Here we go . We 'll begin the bidding at $ 2,000 . 2,000 ? Thank you very much . 2,000 I have . Looking for 2,100 . Thank you . 2,100 . 2,200 anywhere ? - She 's going after my knife . - Do you not understand how an auction works ? Looking for 2,300 . 2,300 to you . Thank you very much . 2,400 anywhere in the room ? 2,400 . My budget isn 't unlimited , Nanny McSnootyson . I hate her . This is silly . Why didn 't we just buy it before it went to auction ? Because we 're stealth , dude . We try not to get noticed . And aren 't you a Buddhist or something ? Try being one with the Universe for like a minute . I am Zen . I am way Zen . I can meditate for like two hours . Which , by the way , would be more exciting than this . 2,800 . Looking for 2,900 anywhere in the room . 2,900 may I say ? 2,800 once , twice , fair warning . Sold to bidder number 14 for $ 2,800 . Yes ! I mean bravo . Yes . Hear , hear . We can go home now , poopy-pants . You 've got a new nickname . I like " Jinksy . " Stolen ? What do you mean stolen ? It must 've happened before the auction this morning . In all my years of holding a gavel , this has never occurred . I 'm completely mortified . We 'll be back . He 's mortified ? My first real case , and the artifact gets stolen . First time on my own- - no offense . - Now we have a bad guy . - Yeah , great . And it 's our fault there 's somebody out there with the power to make anyone sick . We appreciate you giving us a call . Well , when it happened again , I thought you guys would be interested . Dr. Lisa Ward . She 's a surgeon here . Middle of a quad bypass , and forgot how to perform the surgery . Chief had to scrub in . Oh , my God . Who are you guys ? Call my mom , okay ? I want to go home now . Same symptoms as the pilot ? Not as far regressed yet . Two victims unrelated . I mean , they didn 't know each other . Different jobs , different neighborhoods , different everything . There has to be a connection . Well , maybe the artifact is airborne or in the water . Then why just these two ? I mean , why aren 't more people being affected ? Okay , I 'll follow the paper trail , see if their lives meet anywhere . Okay . I 'll talk to Leena and see what we can dig up about memory loss artifacts . Okay . What ? Wh-what is it ? No , nothing . I- - Uh , I--nothing . I spaced out . Never mind . I 'll see ya later . Hey , Mr. Mortified , we spoke to the woman who bid against me . She didn 't steal it . Are you sure ? Maybe she was lying . She wasn 't . Yeah . So we 're gonna need to see timecards for any employees who had access to the collection room this morning . Certainly . But I can 't imagine it was any of my people . Hello . The janitor went home early . He was sick this morning . Owen Larsen . But he wasn 't sick . He quit . It says here that he 's only worked for you for a week ? Well , he 's an older gentleman . He said the work was too much for him . Really ? Coincidence the name is Larsen ? - I got the address . - Let 's go . Nothing so far , well , not with those particular memory loss symptoms . That doesn 't mean it 's not out there . Well , we 'll take whatever you can find . So ... how is it ... Being back ? I don 't know . Pete says everything is fine , so maybe I should just relax . Why do you ask ? Nothing . No reason . Leena , did you pick something up on Pete aura-wise ? Myka , anything that I happen to see in Pete 's aura could just be- - You did . Okay , I 'm not imagining it . There is something bothering him . Leena , you have to tell me what it is . Tell you what ? Did she find something ? Oh ! No ! No , nothing . It 's just ... Girl stuff . - Gross . - Yeah . What do you got ? No clue , meet clue . Check out the credit card statements for pilot man and doctor lady . They ate at the same restaurant . That 's right . Jalapeno Harry 's . Same night . April 6th , the night a waitress named Amy was murdered there . Feel free to applaud my brilliance . Yeah , maybe later . Well , I 'm gonna drop in and see what I can see . Okay , I 'm gonna talk to the victims , mention the name of the restaurant . Maybe it 'll jog something loose in their minds . - Okay . - Hey , Pete . - Yeah ? - Uh ... Before ... You said everything was fine . And ... yet we 're still talking about it . I just think ... Even if it 's hard , you can say anything to me . Yeah ? Are--are you sure ? Absolutely . Anything . Anything . Okay . Wow , it 's- - it 's kind of hard . Uh , you know what ? Fine . I 'm just- - I 'm just gonna come out and say it . Um ... The force will be with you always . If you don 't- - Also , release the Kraken . This is Chinatown Jake . So stay classy , San Diego . And pink is my signature color . - Never mind . - Let 's not forget I love the smell of napalm in the morning . I think we 're gonna need a bigger boat . Yo , Adrian , I did it . And say good night to the bad guy . Hello ? Hi ! Welcome home ! How 's about we get you started with an onion cone ? How many in your party ? Oh , no , thanks , but I have some questions about the night of April 6th . Um , I 'm here about these two people . They both ate dinner here that night . I was hoping you might remember them . Sorry , can 't help you . Hey , how 's about some pretzel fries ? Uh , no . No , I better not . Um , anyone else around here might remember them ? No , okay ? Look , if you 're not gonna eat , you 're gonna have to leave . Uh , Ken ... The thing is ... I think you know more . Look , I 'm sorry . Okay , the cops keep coming in here . It scares the customers . All right , well , I 'm not a cop , so you can talk to me . Now , this thing says that the victim was one of your waitresses . Yeah . Amy . Great girl . It was awful . A couple of the customers from that night are being called as witnesses . Yeah . Those two . The cops have arrested this guy , Geoffery Cedolia . They have him in custody . The trial starts next week . Well , whatever it is , we 'd better figure this out fast . Why ? What 's going on over there ? The pilot 's lost all his memories . There 's no one there anymore . The doctors think the involuntary systems will go next- - swallowing , blinking ... He 's forgetting how to breathe , Pete . If he had just left the knife in his apartment , we 'd be on our way back by now , mission accomplished . Don 't worry . The landlady said he 'd be right back . You know , the key is ... Clearing your head of all distracting thought . Focus just on the target . I 've been on stakeouts before , Mahatma . Okay , I 'm sure you have . And , you know , I have mission experience . Remember , I 'm the ... Senior agent . I remember . Has it been five minutes already ? Look , I am just now noticing that you seem super-focused on the whole senior agent thing . Maybe because I 'm the senior agent . Right . And since we both already really , really know that , maybe you should try to , you know , just ... Relax . I mean , it 's just the two of us out here . Oh . I get it . Get what ? What are you getting ? What 's ... Happening here . Um , we 're out of town , alone , two reasonably attractive single people . Oh . Oh , uh- - It 's okay . No , it 's not like I 'm not flattered . I am , and , hey , I felt it too- - that crackling chemistry between us . It 's just that I really need to focus on my career right now . I don 't have a ton of bandwidth for other stuff , as attractive as that other stuff may be . Okay , so maybe in a year or two , if you haven 't gotten me out of your system- - Oh , my God . I 'm not hitting on you . I 'm gay . You 're ... how now ? Gay . You know , when two people of the same sex find each other- - Oh , but- - no , I know what gay means . I- - Look , I usually--I don 't make a big deal about it . You didn 't . I--I thought- - you know what I thought . No , no , no , no . You know what ? It 's my bad . It 's my fault . I should 've stopped you . I was just waiting for you to ... Take a breath . No , it 's cool . I 've actually been , um , waiting for an opportunity to feel this completely mortified with myself , so it 's , uh- - I 'm sorry . Maybe we should just ... - Not talk . - Stop talk--yeah . Good--good thought . Super . Yes , yes . I really am innocent . I know that sounds like a cliche . Are you trying to find out who 's incapacitating our witnesses ? Yes . And , Geoffery , actually , I 'm not here about whether you did it or not . Why do you guys think your witnesses are getting sick ? Sick ? Do you honestly believe that ? Well , I 've seen them- - Or is it possible , Agent Lattimer , that my witnesses were scared off by the prosecution , the government prosecution ? I wasn 't trying to imply- - Maybe you , also a government employee , might feel the need to protect your brethren . Look , you 're a lawyer , I get it . But I 'm neutral , guys . I promise . And I 've seen your witnesses . They 're not well , and they 're not faking . And I 'm sorry about that . But you do realize Geoffery 's life is at stake here , don 't you ? Shouldn 't you be protecting Eric ? - Eric ? - Eric Bell , my best friend . I drove him home that night , so he knows I left the restaurant . They 're gonna argue Geoffery drove back to the restaurant to kill that woman . Tire tracks match his car . I went home and went to bed . My girlfriend was at home , but she 's pregnant , so I didn 't wanna wake her . Right . So she can 't confirm what time you got there . They 're trying the case in the press . Victim 's mother 's on TV every other night , crying . This whole thing has been a nightmare . Honestly , I just want that young man to pay for what he did to my daughter . You 've been very vocal about Mr. Cedolia 's guilt . A person who didn 't trust that he would be found guilty might take matters into their own hands . Why don 't you come out and say it ? If you 've done anything to Mr. Cedolia 's witnesses , or if you 've done anything to tamper with this case before it goes to trial- - I haven 't . That would be vengeance , not justice . He 'll be found guilty . I know it . I have faith in the system . Hello , hello ! Hi . Who 's this ? Agent Bering , this is Courtney Moore from KTRD news . We have an interview scheduled for now , right ? Yes . We were just finishing up . Courtney 's been very supportive . She 's given my daughter 's story lots of airtime . People need to know about this tragedy . Agent Bering , is it ? Yes . Still investigating ? ' Cause we have the killer in custody . Geoffery Cedolia did it . Alleged killer . My agency isn 't quite done yet . Typical government waste . My viewers already know the truth . How nice for your viewers . So if you 'll excuse us . We should get started . - Yes . - Thank you so much for your time . Thank you . You know , I can 't help noticing ... Should I guess the rest ? That you put a lot of pressure on yourself . Yeah . Silly me , huh ? Just trying to be good at my job . What a geekola . Yeah , but you are good at your job . You don 't have to try . Geez . But , I mean , I 'm not trained like you guys . I 'm not Secret Service , or ATF , or NSA , or m-o-u-s-e . I 'm not a real agent . You 're real . You 're also lying . Wh-what ? No . No , I- - I 'm- - I have no training . No , not about the training . About caring about the training . Artie . You wanna impress him . Yes ! Angela Lansbury , you 've solved the mystery ! Yeah , I wanna make him proud . You don 't know how good to me he 's been . I can 't- - I can 't let him down . Well , do you think that he would send you out here if he wasn 't already proud of you ? You know , I never had a gay friend before . Which is weird , if you think about it , 'cause I 'm sort of fabulous , right ? I mean , I guess there was Paquito at the institution , but he was just one of Susan 's personalities , so I don 't think he really counts . And I just told you I was in an institution . So I guess today 's sharing day . - Eagle 's on the move . - Bet you my self-esteem the knife 's in that messenger bag . Mr. Larsen ! Could we talk to you for a minute ? Who are you ? We know all about the knife , Owen . Just hand it over . All right . I knew it wouldn 't work . You got me . Here ! Aah ! Hey ! Oh , my God . Are you all right ? Yeah , I 'm okay . Just stop him . Okay . All right . My knee ! Aah ! - Artie , what- - - He 's getting away ! What are you doing here ? My knee . He transferred- - chase him ! What are you doing here ? What ? Nothing . Nothing . Just , you know , I finished in Manchester early , and I thought I 'd swing through Boston . For the Red Sox and ... chowder . You were spying on me . No . Claudia ! Hey , you really need to work on your timing . Mrs. Bell , we were hoping to talk to your son Eric about Geoffery 's case . Then we heard you brought him here this morning , after he was affected . - Geoffy ? Is Geoffy here ? - No , honey . He can 't come play . Eric and Geoffery have been friends since kindergarten . I wanna play with Geoffy ! My son , he 's been like this all day . What is wrong with him ? I 'm sorry , but we don 't know yet . He 's the third victim now . There was a reporter at Amy 's mother 's house . Her name was Courtney Moore . Has Eric had any kind of interaction with her by chance ? Well , she 's been speaking with a lot of the witnesses . Why ? Courtney could be hitting every witness , one by one . Courtney ? Who 's that ? Well , she 's the reporter . I told you . God , don 't you listen to anything that- - Pete ... Pete , what 's happening ? Pete ! Whoa , man , you 're hot . Who are you ? Pete , you ... Hey ! Hi . Are--are- - Pete , are you comfortable ? Do you need anything ? No , I feel good . You 're pretty . Okay , that 's- - that 's gotta stop right now . Um , okay , Pete , listen to me . I 'm gonna fix this . Everything is gonna be all right , I promise . I want everybody to stop saying that . 'Cause it 's not gonna be . It 's never gonna be all right again . Why would you say that ? I mean , why wouldn 't everything be all right , huh ? 'Cause my dad died . And he 's not coming home . Right . I 'm so sorry . Pete ... It must ... Be hard for you . It 's hard on my mom . I don 't see her that much since he died . She tries to stay busy so she doesn 't miss him that much . I guess ... That must feel like maybe you 're ... Losing her a little bit too . You still have your sister , though . Right ? Yeah . But ... She 's gonna go to college in a couple years . Everybody keeps leaving me . What the hell are you doing to people and why ? Agent Bering . Hello to you too . So we 're doing a little show here , and since you 're currently not making any sense , I 'm just gonna ignore you . My partner Pete is regressing like the others . Now , what are you using to make this happen ? Look , those people aren 't sick . They dropped out because they know Geoffery 's a killer . I don 't know what game your partner 's playing , but ... I mean ... who were we ? What is it ? I 'm sorry . What 's wrong ? - Courtney ... - Who are you ? Where are we ? Somebody help me ! Courtney , it 's okay . It 's okay . So we just need to figure out where this guy would go . Probably has got a system here . He 's pretty clever , actually . Algorithms , plus cell tower triangulation . Also ... Facebook . - Do you have any idea- - - Not even the tiniest clue . What ? You 're not perfect ? Should we talk about why you 're so upset ? I 'm not upset . I 'm just undoing the mess you made here and redoing it correctly . Oh , yeah ? I did not come here to spy on you , not the way you think anyway . Oh , sure . The good kind of spying , like , here , have some flowers , and a puppy , and some spying . I came here to see you in action , dum-dum . It 's your first case as a non-apprentice . I--I wanted to be here . - He 's telling the truth . - Sometimes that 's annoying . That 's funny . You 're not the first person to say- - Go . So you got to see me screwing ' up . You got a curveball . We all get ' em . It 's not your fault . And look how you 're not giving up . That 's the girl I know- - uh , woman . Girl . I 'm still proud of you . - I actually told her that too . - Means more from Artie . Fair enough . I just found Larsen . And I think I know why he wanted the knife . Hey , wait . Where are you going ? We 're about to snag the artifact . I 'm going home . Wait , a-Artie . Artie . You 've got this . I trust you ! Look , it 's not just your witnesses that are getting sick now . It 's my partner and the reporter Courtney Moore . How is she connected to all of this ? Wish I knew . Maybe Courtney picked it up by shoving her microphone into everybody 's face . She 's pretty aggressive . She only acts tough . Why do you say that ? 'Cause when my attorney stood up to her , she folded like laundry . Sawyer stood up to Courtney Moore ? Yeah . She tried that whole ambush with the microphone routine . I heard it went badly for her . - Oh , my God . - It 's already happening . You 're too late . You can take me away now . You 're too late . We 're not here to take you away . We just want the knife . He 's my son . It wasn 't fair . Now it is . Cancer . Leukemia . I 'm sorry . I couldn 't just let him die . He has a little boy . So you started researching cures . Anything . Even a crackpot theory on an urban myth website about Typhoid Mary 's knife . That 's why you took the job at the auction house- - to get the knife . It sounded insane . A knife that could transfer illness ? But when it gave that fellow my busted knee , well ... But that means ... Now you 're sick . Now it 's fair . My boy 's life is just starting out . He can watch his son grow up , protect him . Now it 's fair . Are you gonna arrest me for taking the knife ? No . We don 't go after bad guys . We go after artifacts . Dad ? What 's going on ? You cannot tell Courtney I showed you this . She was very specific about who was allowed to see it . - Let me guess--no one ? - Ever . And per her threat , I would like to keep my reproductive organs . I promise . Mr. Sawyer . Sir , why are you defending a murderer ? I 'm not . I 'm defending a man accused of murder . In this country , there 's a difference . And what about Amy 's family ? I suppose you think the first amendment only protects your client ? Who protects his victims ? Okay , powder-puff , do you realize the first amendment protects all of us , mostly you , because it deals with freedom of speech . But you don 't mean the first amendment . You mean the fifth amendment , don 't you ? Due process . Yes . There 's gotta be something , something out of place , or something ... old ... Then again , you have a dog in this fight , don 't you ? I don 't know what you mean . Aren 't you pitching your own show for national syndication ? The tough , vigilante ... Who wears a tie clip anymore ? If your first target 's found not guilty , you won 't look very marketable , now , will you ? You 're recording all this , right ? He was grilling her hard . Like she was on trial . I don 't usually feel sorry for her , but- - Everyone affected was questioned by Sawyer . Courtney , his witnesses during trial prep ... Pete said he went after him too . While he was wearing that tie clip , I bet . Look , they 'll be bringing Geoffery out any minute , and I need to see him alone . I would not damage my own case . Of course not . Mr. Sawyer , look , I think someone found a way to use you . How long have you had that tie clip ? What , this ? A week maybe . It was left as a gift . No note . This might sound silly ... I feel confident when I wear it . A week . That 's right when it started . When what started ? No , please don 't ask me any questions . I think that 's what causes this thing- - may I ? W.W. Asking questions . Walter Winchell . Good call . Look at this old photograph . Winchell was famous for pulling information out of people . Wait , Leena , can you show me his hands ? It 's the same as the tie clip . They 're a set . You think it 's a bifurcated artifact ? If the tie clip pulls memories out of people , then maybe the cufflinks put them back in . After all , Winchell didn 't leave a trail of brain-dead interviewees . I need to find those cufflinks , and I bet you know where they are . I did some digging . There was a young cub reporter who worked at the New York Daily Mirror in the 1930s when Winchell was just starting there . A guy named Louis Thompson . Leena , how does that help me ? His granddaughter Sarah Bell and her son Eric live in Seattle . Where are they ? Where 's Eric ? Mrs. Bell checked her son out about an hour ago . A miraculous recovery . It 's weird . He 's fine now . Hey , hey , hey . Uh , are you leaving ? Yeah , I gotta go stop a bad guy . Okay , uh , I wanna come with you . No , you--you can 't . It 's dangerous . - But you 're leaving . - I 'm coming back . Pete , I will come back . I promise . - Just go . I don 't care . - But ... Agent Bering . I 'd invite you in , but clearly you 've already- - Where are the cuff links ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . You 've already used them on your son , haven 't you ? I know that he has his memory back . I can 't help those other people . Of course you can 't . Because you don 't want Geoffery being found innocent . You don 't want the police looking for the real killer- - your son Eric . No , you 're wrong . He killed that waitress . Now , give me those cufflinks . Get out . Or I drop the cufflinks . They 're destroyed forever , and your partner never gets better . As soon as we 're somewhere safe , I will send them to you , and you can save everyone . What if you don 't , or what if the damage is permanent ? You 'll have to shoot me . Think of those innocent people . Think of what you 're doing to them . Mom ? What people is she talking about ? You said I was the only one . Eric , get in the car . I never should 've gone along with this . I made a mistake . I have to pay for that now . I am not gonna let them just put you away . It was an accident ! Please , Ma . No ! Are you ready ? Whoo ! Whoo ! Cool ! You 're a sweet kid . Well , daddy calls me a charming ' varmint . Okay . So ... Okay , Pete , I- - can you look at me ? Okay . Now , I want you to look at these ... shiny cufflinks . Mykes . Yeah . Yeah . The world is such a scary place . Mr. Sawyer , you never gave up on your client , whom we now know is completely innocent . Where did you find the strength to keep going ? You gotta have faith in your principles , even when ignorant people try to stop you . Sometimes it seems like it 's nothing but anger . And violence . And hurt . It can be terrifying when you 're out there in it . But if you know where to look for it ... The world also has warmth . And love . And forgiveness . I guess I should get out of this- - Wait , wait , wait , wait . Just--just let me talk . There was something bothering you , even though you didn 't know what it was . We 're partners ... Pete . And I should never have left the warehouse without talking to you first . All this time , I thought that you had something to say to me , but you don 't have to say anything . I do . And I think that we both need me to say it . I 'm sorry . Thanks . The world has joy in it . When you find a place that allows you to experience that joy , when you find people that make you feel safe and loved , like you belong ... You don 't walk away from it . You fight for it . It 's easy to forget that , isn 't it ? I keep thinking about this kid Eric . He 'd been dating Amy in secret for months . No one knew , not even his best friend . But when she broke it off with him , he was hurt . He took Geoffery 's car to confront her , and ... And it ended badly . Very . And when his mother found out , she- - well , she sent that tie clip to destroy Geoffery 's case . She thought the memory loss was temporary , didn 't she ? It was still a terrible thing to do . But ... She was protecting her son . Like you thought you were protecting all of us when you left . No one is blaming you for that , but the stakes do get high . Do you feel equipped to handle that again ? I just nailed a one-inch light switch from 20 feet away . Yeah , I 'm okay . I just had to ... prove to myself that I could do it . There 's pressure in any job . I like this one . And what about your relationship with Agent Lattimer ? Are you able to move forward ? He 's an extraordinary partner . Please don 't tell him I said that . Good then . We had to know that you could handle being back . We also needed you to know that you could handle it . We have no more questions .

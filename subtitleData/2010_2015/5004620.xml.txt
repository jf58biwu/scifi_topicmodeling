 Previously on Fringe : I got called to a crime scene outside the city . I saw Etta for the first time . She recruited me in the resistance . Taught me how to block them from reading my thoughts . - Who is the Dove ? - I don 't know . Nobody does . How far have you come with the tapes ? We have the rocks from the mine in Pennsylvania , the magnet , beacons ... - ... and the scrolls of physics . - They are part of the device we must build . If we can send the boy into the future , when they study him they will realize all that he is . And they will never go down that path . And the Observers will never invade . The plan is gonna reset time . Michael is how we 're gonna see Etta again . There 's one thing I haven 't told the others . He showed me that for the plan to work , I would have to sacrifice myself . Michael . Michael ! - Where 's Michael ? - He just walked off the train . Hello . Call me back when you have something . - No answer . - Anil put the word out to his contacts . Nobody 's heard anything about a child Observer . I do not understand . I can track the convoy that 's transporting the boy to Jay Street then they fall off the grid . - I can 't even track them on satellites . - Keep trying . Where is Donald ? Why did we agree to let him to contact us ? We didn 't know we 'd lose Michael . What if he knows how to communicate with the boy ? Has a way of finding him ? When he gets back with the tech we 'll find out . We need to find him before Windmark figures out he 's the key to the plan . Call him again . Lieutenant . - I 'm sorry , I 'm running late for a meeting . - So am I. A high-value detainee was taken into custody last night . I need to know where he 's being held . I 'm under strict orders not to disclose that information . I understand . Word came down that my division is to supply reinforced security . I wasn 't informed of that . Well , I 'm informing you now . There 's supposed to be a measure of cooperation between our departments . Or have you forgotten that ? Agent , there 's a change in protocol after the security breaches from within . Lieutenant . Are you suggesting that I might be the Dove ? I 'm more of a raven , don 't you think ? Right . Detention Camp 17 , east wing . Liberty Island . Thank you . Who is the detainee , anyway ? Hell if I know . I am intrigued by you , Anomaly XB-6783746 . It is in your interest to communicate with me . The people you were with what did they want with you ? You are of significance to them . What is your purpose ? Tell me about September . The one who hid you . Why did he hide you ? To what end ? The fugitives have a plan . Tell me about the plan . How does it involve you ? Run complete and thorough diagnostics . Find out what it is . Broyles , did you find him ? Yes , but the news isn 't good . They 're holding him at a detention facility on Liberty Island . I 'm uploading the schematic to you . Okay , I got it . Looks like a fortress . It is . The towers are manned around the clock . And inside the complex , you 're dealing with at least five layers of security . - Can you get us in ? - I don 't have the clearance . Where exactly are they keeping him ? The east wing . In what they call their Neurological Research Unit . They 're going to experiment on him . Most likely , yes . Or worse . No building is impenetrable , how do we get in ? I could get you a boat but there are sensors located around the perimeter , monitoring all movement . What if I could hack into the system and disable them remotely ? They 've got multiple , redundant alarm systems . If one is tampered with , the others automatically lock the place down . We need an end run . We need to bypass security altogether . How ? The Other Side . The other side of what ? You mean the alternate universe . What if the island is accessible from over there ? If I can find the right location , then I can cross over grab Michael from underneath them and then bring him back with me . Walter said the Cortexiphan burned out of your system . Without that , you no longer have the ability to cross over . Maybe there 's a way I can get it back . Perhaps she can . How do we even know if the Cortexiphan is still good ? It has a shelf life of 127 years . Belly made sure of it . How do we know that this is going to work ? When you ran the trials , you gave Olivia controlled doses over an extended period . That 's true . But Olivia 's treatments created a unique network of neural pathways in her brain . They may have atrophied from disuse but a sudden jolt of Cortexiphan could reactivate them . Temporarily , at least . Temporarily ? How long would I have ? I don 't know . I 'll have to calibrate that once I 've determined just how massive a dose I can safely give you . How could a massive dose possibly be safe ? The side effects of Cortexiphan have always been unpredictable . Can you tell me you know how she would react ? I don 't know . I think- - - Could it give her seizures ? - Possibly . - Could it stop her heart ? - Yes . Could it cause her to phase in and out , disappear entirely , burst into flames ? Those are the risks , yes . I will do all I can to mitigate it but I can 't eliminate them altogether . It 's too dangerous . Peter , what other choice do we have ? We can 't let anything happen to him . Etta died so that we could finish the plan . " Both feet in . " That 's what we said . And what if I lose you too ? What then ? I can do this . And without him we lose everything . All right , let 's say you could cross over . What then ? We have no idea what you 'd find over there . Their Department of Defense was on Liberty Island . It was on Liberty Island . We closed that bridge 24 years ago . The Observers could have invaded over there as well . We have no way of knowing what happened . Not necessarily . The Universe Window . Why don 't we just have a look ? Of course . That 's brilliant , Ascot . Peter , help us with the window . The paralytic will render him motionless from the neck down assuring there will be no interference with our diagnostics . Alert me when you have the results . Whoa , whoa . We got a Loyalist . All right , she 's gone . - You ready for the window ? - Yes . Hey , Walter ? Make sure that you- - Ouch ! - Fudge sticks ! - Plug the other one in first . There . Peter . Olivia . Moment of truth . It 's working . Call Anil . We 're gonna need a safe house and medical equipment . Isn 't she beautiful ? Hello ? Walter ? It 's this way . This is Tobin , our field surgeon . He 'll assist you in whatever way he can . Dr. Bishop . I got the items you requested . I asked for a defibrillator . I wasn 't able to secure one in time . In case of cardiac arrest , I do have this . Adrenalin . It 's riskier . It will have to suffice . We must get started . For the Cortexiphan to take effect quickly it must be injected directly into the brain stem . In the back of your neck . - I 'm okay . - Ready for the first dose ? One , two ... Her heart rate 's elevated , Walter , 160 bpm and rising . Liv ? I 'm okay , let 's keep going . Take a deep breath and exhale . Heart rate is 180 bpm , Walter . Olivia ? Hey , Liv . Honey , look at me . Olivia ? Honey , look at me . Peter . Walter , she can 't see me . - She 's at 200 bpm . You have to stop this . - I have to elevate her heart rate . I know enough about the human body ... - ... to see you might kill this woman . - Hold her down , son . I 've got you . I created Cortexiphan . There is no better authority . - Okay , that 's enough . Enough ! - One more . Come on . - She needs all four . - Walter , I said that 's enough . She has to cross over four times . Do you want to leave her stranded on the Other Side ? Trust me . There is an uncharacteristic development in the brain 's emotional centers . This is not normal . The limbic system is vestigial . And yet his is substantially enlarged . It has sent tendrils into the brain 's cognitive center integrating emotional and intellectual activity to an extent that we previously deemed impossible . I will make the report . Sacrifice is hard , son . But you 're no stranger to it . Neither are you , Dad . You 've sacrificed a lot . Peter . What is it ? You 're very strong , son . Come , let 's wake her up . Olivia . Olivia . Peter , I think we 're gonna get our daughter back . The plan is gonna reset time . Olivia . How are you feeling ? Can I get you some water ? No , thank you . I 'm fine . Have you figured out how long I 've got before it wears off ? To be safe , approximately three and a half hours from the time of your last injection . Any longer than that , and you may become stranded . I 've set this watch accordingly . And something else . With every jump ... a significant amount of the drug will be burned up in your system . If it burns up too fast , you may experience symptoms of withdrawal . Disorientation , hallucinations , lapses in time . If this occurs you must cross back immediately . It is of paramount importance that you do this . I understand . Are you experiencing any dizziness , headache ? From the Cortexiphan , or from the light you keep shining in my eyes ? Be careful , dear . I will , Walter . We 'll be waiting for you at Battery Park when you cross back over . So assuming Fringe Division is still in the same location when you cross over you should be right in front of it . Are you sure you can find her ? I think she 'll probably find me . You 're coming back . You 're coming back with the boy . For Etta . I love you . I love you too . We 've got a breach . Dunham . Olivia ? It 's me . I was in amber for 21 years . What are you doing here ? I need your help . So once you were ambered how did you get out ? Our daughter freed us . So you found her . I can 't imagine what you went through losing ... Liv ? I 'm sorry . What was I saying ? That you were hoping you were gonna see Etta again . If the plan 's successful . Are you okay ? Yeah . I don 't have much time . So the boy is being held at a detention camp on Liberty Island ? On our side , yes . So my goal is to cross over , grab him , and then bring him back over here . Then we 'll cross home through Battery Park . I 'll arrange the transport to Liberty Island . A lot 's changed since you 've been here . Yeah , I can see that . You sure you 're okay ? Yeah . The deformity of the anomaly 's brain has resulted in profound neurological changes . In what respect ? It has developed an intellect more advanced than our own and a capacity for emotional responsiveness far greater than the native humans . Curious . How is this possible ? Unknown . It possesses capabilities our diagnostic instruments cannot measure and that we are unable to comprehend . That is very troubling . I believe the fugitives intend to use the anomaly as a means to our destruction . It would be to our evolutionary advantage to continue to study it further . A more prudent path is to destroy it . There is no greater danger than that which is unknown . It is irrelevant whether the anomaly lives or dies . What is valuable is understanding what it was . Disassemble it . Preserve the pieces . Okay , I 'm gonna go check the schematics of the facilities office . I 'll be right back . - It 's so good to see you . - You too . What about Walternate ? He retired from the D.O.D. about 20 years ago moved back to Boston . He 's 90 years old , he still lectures at Harvard ... - ... can you believe that ? - Heh.No. It 's crazy how life works out . It 's okay . I made my choices , you made yours . I don 't regret any of them , and neither should you . You deserve all the happiness that you got . Okay , it 's this way . You can stop checking out my young ass . This is it ? If your coordinates are right yeah , this is the same location as the room that they 're holding the boy on your side . We 'll be here when you get back with him . Hey . This will work . I gotta go . Unh ! There has been a breach in security . Remain here until it is resolved . Don 't move . Michael ? You okay ? Okay . We 're gonna get you out of here . Behind you ! You okay ? You better get going . I 'll be here in case any more come across . Be careful . You too . Thank you . You have a beautiful family . Thank you . Go save yours . Get your daughter back . Ready ? Okay . Liv . Hey . - Are you okay ? - I think so . It 's okay , Michael , you 're safe now . They know I crossed over . I don 't think we have much time . You stay with her . I 'll drive . You asked to see me , sir . Is there a problem ? You were one of three officers who knew the high-value detainee 's location . If you imparted this information to anyone else I need to know . He told me that you authorized it , sir . Who ? Agent Broyles . I never thought I 'd see you again . Walter Bishop is back . We have the boy . There 's something I need you to do . You owe me .

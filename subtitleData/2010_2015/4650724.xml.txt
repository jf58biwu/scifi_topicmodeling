 Previously on Continuum ... He was anticipating my every move ! More advanced than you . I 've been thinking , about you and me . There is no you and me . Well , your secret 's safe with me . Ready to make a change Julian ? It 's for the cause , for Liber8 . You 're all saying we need to stand ... No , no , no ... I never advocated violence . Show a little bit of respect ! I 'm done with you from this moment on . Whiskey Romeo Bravo , in pursuit of suspects . Requesting assistance . Whiskey Romeo Bravo , searching . Over . This is Vancouver CPS , hold your position . What the hell happened back there ? You told me you were going for a job interview ! And I got so much more . You know what this is ? Of course , they 're thermalite detonators . That 's why I stole them . I know I 'm your brother and all , but this is crazy . Kagame 's supposed to meet us here . Liber8 ? You told me you were done with that . Alpha One , Tango spotted . Let 's go ! Come on ! Positive identification , Matthew Lorne Kellog . Requesting permission to engage , sir . Whisky Romeo Bravo , permission granted . Over . Firing . Whisky Romeo Bravo , report . Positive contact , two suspects . I think one of them is injured . On descent . Stand by to mobilize . You gotta go . You gotta go , Matt . I 'm not leaving you . I 'm not leaving you . Get these to Kagame . - Now . - No . He 'll find you , just run . You gotta go . Go ! You 've only got seconds . You 're gonna go to jail . The country . It 's amazing ! Yeah , if you like the smell of cow crap . Fertilizer can be used to make bombs and you 're part of the gang task-force , so ... Mmm hmm . Come on , we get a day in the country ! We can see horses and cows ... It 's amazing . Excuse me sir , we 're looking for Mr. Randol . That 's me . I 'm agent Kiera Cameron , this is my partner Detective Carlos Fonnegra ... We 'd like to talk to you . All right , well ... we 're talking . Question is why . Sellers of ammonium nitrate are required to call us when a large fertilizer order 's been placed . And you 've been identified as someone making such an order . So ... what , you 're the shit police ? We got 10 working acres , 5 more in the backfield . Hardly use enough fertilizer to be suspicious . Well , they said you ordered 1,500 kilograms . Well , that 's impossible . Okay , can I see your invoices for all of your recent purchases ? You make it sound like I have a choice . I uh , found Brandy 's warming blanket . All right , good . Oh my God , what are you doing here ? You know my son ? 2077 . My time , my city , my family . When terrorists killed thousands of innocents , they were condemned to die . They had other plans A time travel device sent us all back 65 years . I want to get home but I can 't be sure what I will return to , if history is changed . Their plan - to corrupt and control the present in order to win the future . What they didn 't plan on was me . CONTINUUM S01 E09 - Family time Alec , do you know this woman ? Uh no , not her . You , you were on the news last month , right ? A suspect in a murder case . Yeah ... I was uh , cleared of all suspicions , that was a mistake . And now that we 've got that sorted out , let me see those invoices Mr. Randol . Yeah , of course . I 've got nothing to hide . Alec uh , put her in the pasture . I 'll uh , I 'll keep an eye on the boy . Good . The boy ? " What are you doing here " ? You startled me . Why didn 't you tell me you were coming ? I didn 't know this was your farm . Your father ordered a large a supply of fertilizer , we have to check these things out . He 's my stepfather . It 's probably for the back acre , it 's been fallow . You wanna see my setup ? This ... is impressive . Right ? Wow . Hey , what did you do to it ? I hacked it . Black is so much cooler than copper , ask any nerd . It just needs another systems check , if you 're gonna be around another 20 minutes I can do it now . I 've missed you . Alec , do you have a license for this ? Uh yeah , that 's my stepdad 's and he does . I just use it to kill rats , they get into the equipment and chew on the cables . Is your stepfather involved in anything that might seem radical ? Roland 's not some Al Qaeda in the making if that 's what you 're thinking . But ... There 's no buts . Your stepbrother Julian was involved in those riots a few months back . That was nothing , just teenage angst . You 're scanning me , are you serious ? After everything I 've done for you ? I mean , where 's the trust . I could ask you the same question . Are you hiding something Alec ? No , I 'm not hiding anything . You know what , this is gonna take longer than I thought . We should probably get back , your partner 's probably wondering where you are . Well , we bought 438 kilograms this year . How much did they say that we ordered ? Uh , 1,500 kilograms . No ... Okay , can you show me where you keep the fertilizers so I can check it out ? You don 't trust our word ? Mr. Randol , if I go back to my boss and tell him I didn 't personally inspect the property , then he 's just gonna send someone else out here to bother you . So if you wanna make things easier ... What would be easier is if the government didn 't poke its nose in where it didn 't belong . All right , come on . Vickerdale Enterprises have patented terminator seeds that kill the crops of neighbouring farms and then take root in that farm 's soil . They advocate mono cropping , which strips the land of its nutrients . This will continue and by 2030 , all food cultivation will be controlled by Vickerdale . Hey , you know what Dad 's doing ? Oh , there 's a police officer here investigating some mix up with an order of fertilizer . He 's showing me where they keep the fertilizer . Mr. Randol , where 's your son Julian ? What do you want ? Hey , do you boys know anything about a fertilizer delivery ? No . Nuh uh . Detective Fonnegra wants to look inside the storage barn . Does he have a warrant ? He doesn 't need one . I 'm gonna show him what 's inside . What 's going on ? Nothing . Where 'd this lock come from ? Don 't look at me . I didn 't do it . Go get the bolt cutters . Julian , you were involved in the riots recently , isn 't that correct ? My son made a mistake . We 've had a talk , he 's been punished . Unless you wanna jail him for poor judgment , I suggest we drop the matter . I think you 'll see that ... this has all been a huge mistake . Whose van is this ? Oh my God . Looks like we 're gonna have to take you in for questioning , Mr. Randol . Yeah , I 'm calling this in . I wouldn 't do that if I were you . Drop the gun ! Mr. Randol , get away from the barn . Boys , what are you doing ? Drop the gun ! Julian , get their guns and phones . Drop the gun , Hoyt . Julian , this is not the way to go . Boys , think about what you 're doing . Julian listen to me , listen to me . I know that you boys think you 're helping your friend by coming out here , but you 're committing a major crime . Oh , we 're beyond that . No you 're not . We can all go home and end this easily . No one gets hurt . You can help stop this . It 's all just been one big misunderstanding . Roland ? Everybody down ! On the ground now ! Weapons on the ground ! Give me your phone . Look out ! Carlos ! Drop your weapon ! Drop your weapon or your partner dies ! Drop it ! Julian , what are you doing ? Julian ! We 're in control now . We 're in control now . You sure know how to show a girl a good time . Oh yeah . Nothing says fun like a GSW . See if you can find something to bind these towels with . There 's only one guy on the other side of the door . I figure we can take him , grab his gun ... The more we move you ... we 've gotta get you to a hospital . No , no , no ... I 'll be okay . There 's not many options in here . I 'm just gonna give him this . Hey . I thought you could use this . Sewing kit would 've been more helpful . How 's he doing ? Oh ... what 's going on out there ? Uh , Julian and Hoyt are meeting outside , they 've got Roland and my mom in the kitchen at gunpoint . Roland convinced them to let me bring this to you but I 'm supposed to go right back . Alec , I don 't know how but you 're gonna have to help us get out of here . I don 't know , I mean they 're watching me pretty closely . And this door 's pretty thin , I 'm sure Gates can hear what we 're saying right now . Pretty much . You know , I think this kid 's gonna be helpful after all . Just me , I 'm just leaving . I 'm gonna see if my mom has any food , do you want anything ? Yeah , a sandwich would be ... Okay ... Okay , they 're coming back and they 're expecting me . You and Carlos get out of here while I distract them . Okay , what about you ? I 'll be fine here , I 'm not leaving my mom . So what 's the plan ? Get to the car , radio for help , get the hell out of here . Sounds like a good plan . Great . You think you can do this ? Yeah , I got it . Don 't die on me now . Oh , we Fonnegras are pretty hearty stock . Good cake Mrs. Randol . Thanks , Dan . - Julian , listen to me . - No . Listen to me ! Now we 're gonna tie up our prisoners , that 's the plan . Prisoners ... that 's what we are now , huh ? Be quiet , if you 'd just think about it , you 'd understand . Understand what ? This is the next logical step Mr. Randol . You taught us the corporations don 't care about us . They 're in control of the government , we 're on our own , and you were right about all of that . Sorry . Now , the bastards took your damn farm , all right ? but what you weren 't right about was that a grassroots movement could stop them . We don 't need civil disobedience here , we need a revolution . Boys ... We 're not children . No you 're right , you 're men . Old enough to think things through . Now , I understand your frustration , I get it . But if you continue down this path , you 're gonna be stopped before you can start . I don 't hear anyone coming to stop us Mr. R. All right , we gotta cover our tracks . Dan , get the keys cops ' car . No , no , no wait ! I ... wait , I can get the keys . Just a few more steps . Where are the keys Carlos ? Front right pocket . Aren 't you gonna buy me a drink first ? Still have your sense of humor . All right ... Where do you think you 're going ? 9-1-1 ... Mom ! Mom , are you okay ? Dan , put the gun down , you 're startling her . Don 't try anything ! We won 't Dan , we 're not gonna try to escape . Just put the gun down . I admire your spirit . It 'll get you killed , you know . My partner needs help . You don 't want the blood of a cop on your hands . Listen , the sooner you cooperate , the sooner you 'll get help . Sir , there 's a hostage situation on a farm in Surrey . - Do we know who ? - No confirmation , but it 's the place where Carlos and Kiera were going . Oh my God Julian , the detective is hurt really badly , he needs a doctor . I know what he needs . We 've got a dying cop , you 're holding us hostage ... Is what you have in the barn some kinda bomb ? Everybody shut up ! All right , here 's how this is gonna go down ... No one is gonna die , we 're gonna tie you two up and we 're gonna quietly make our way out of here . With a little luck , someone will eventually come looking for you . My partner is not gonna make it that long . Julian ... he needs a doctor . We 'll call an ambulance from a payphone once we 're gone . Our fight is with the corporations . Fair enough . I said to get their phones . I did . Well you obviously missed a couple . What do we do now Hoyt ? Give yourselves up . I 'll tell them you didn 't mean to shoot Detective Fonnegra . I 'll say that it was an accident . Phil ... I want you to go out to the storage barn and keep watch until I get there . I have a better idea ... we start the revolution now . Ram the van into the police barricade . We do day one right now , that 's it . No , we need to escape . We 're gonna make our statement on our terms , not theirs . What 's day one ? Theseus day . He was a warrior , unified the people of Athens . He was also pushed off a cliff when people turned against him . Yeah , well some challenges are worth the risk . I 've seen thousands of innocents killed for a cause . You know what they called the activists ? Heroes ? Murderers . If you want your message heard ... don 't use violence . You guys should turn yourselves in . Become celebrities . The police are gonna have this place surrounded within minutes , you cannot escape . No , they don 't know the place like I do . We can do this . I want spotters in place , cordon off the perimeter . Full sitrep briefing in 10 minutes . You got it . Got two of mine inside , Fonnegra and Cameron . You understand that when a bomb is involved , public safety is top priority , then officers on the scene . If we can 't negotiate , then we go in . Look , I know how this works . If it comes to that , just make sure your team knows who 's who . They 're beginning surveillance . What you need is a diversion . Shut up ! No , she 's right . Oh good , you 're listening to her now . Just hear me out ... we tell them we 're gonna detonate the bomb , instead we blow up the propane tank . They 're gonna think that 's the bomb . When they 're looking for the dead bodies , we 're gone through the woods . Except that we happen to have five witnesses who know exactly where we 're going . No . We 're not gonna kill them , that 's not what we 're about . You got a psychological profile on this guy ? My people are working on it . Do you have a sense of their arsenal ? Not yet . Is that all the guns ? Looks about right . That 's not all of them . What are you talking about now , bitch ? What did you say ? Nothing . I got your dad 's rat pistol in my workshop . Dan , go get it . Uh , he 's never gonna find it in there . All right , just don 't do anything stupid . Go with him . Gates ! Go lock those two in the pantry . Let them get used to our presence , then we 'll make contact . Bradley ... Randol 's record is clean . Vickerdale Enterprises bankrupted him two years ago . He 's been living on his wife 's property holding anti-corporation rallies since then . Clearly he 's escalated . Sir , we 've got a sighting . Kids . He 's using kids . Wow . First person shooter . Hey , stop ! Sorry , I 'm just checking my emails . Uh , I think the gun is behind that suit somewhere . One for the good guys . I have a plan . Yeah , you gonna tell me what it is ? Of course not . Kiera ? Alec . What ? I don 't have much time , they 're expecting me back soon . You 've got me here , what do you want me to do ? Connect me to Inspector Dillon . Who are you talking to ? Okay , just a second . Aw , come on . Did you patch me through to the phone ? Good and ready to go , sir . This is Dillon . Bingo ! Hello ? Sir , it 's Cameron . Kiera ? Bradley ! Hey , can we keep it down ! Kiera , what 's the situation ? How many assailants ? Five , armed with handguns and shotguns . There are three hostages , two of them are in the kitchen , one of them is the barn . Carlos and I are in the pantry and Carlos has been shot . How bad ? It 's not good . Listen , there 's a bomb in the storage barn . They are going to explode the propane tank as a diversion and escape through back roads . I 'll have the chance to take out the leader . Cameron , this is ERT Commander Bradley . My team are in position , let them do their job . Stand down , keep your partner alive . With all due respect sir , I am unwilling to stand down because if nothing is done my partner dies . Cameron , listen to me very carefully ... the first priority is to defuse the bomb before Randol can detonate it . What 's going on ? No , sir ... Hello ? Roland Randol is ... he 's a hostage ! She 's gone . Hello ? Sir ? Wow , you really got a good shock from that . I told you not to touch that wire . You okay ? Hey , what are you doing ? Just getting more towels for the bleeding cop . Is Cameron gonna screw this up ? I trust her instincts . Yeah , well the last thing I need is a hothead running around , getting people killed . She 's not gonna be a problem . I hope you 're right . Everything 's gonna be okay . You 're a lousy liar . Despite all your lies , I still trust you . More than anyone ... although your name 's probably not even Kiera . My name is Kiera Cameron . I have a little boy and a husband that I 'm likely to never see again . If I don 't do everything right while I 'm here , they may never exist . And the only friend I have ... I lie to him every day . But I hate it . I 'm sorry Carlos . Can I get this to the cops ? Why are you being so cooperative all of a sudden , huh ? You got the guns and the manpower . I 'm not stupid . Drop it off then come back . I think you could use these . Yeah , towels ... thank you . Okay then . Answer it . Don 't answer it ! They 're trying to help ! Is anyone gonna answer the phone ? Hello ? Mr. Randol , are you there ? Yes , I 'm ... Yeah , yeah I 'm Roland Randol . Mr. Randol , this is Martin Bradley of the VPD . Carlos ? This is my plan . I 'm gonna lead them all outside and one by one I 'm gonna pick ' em off . You 're a good man , Carlos . You have hostages , one of them hurt . Carlos Fonnegra , how is he ? He 's alive . The others , are they okay ? Yeah , they 're okay . Roland , can I call you Roland ? I know what happened with your farm , I can only imagine ... Enough chitchat ! We 're not afraid to die to have our statement heard . Who 's speaking now , Mr. Randol ? The world 's turned its power over to the corporations . We cry out for our rights and no one listens . We voted against them , nobody listens . The only way to make people listen is to give our lives . Hey ... Wait , we 're listening . We 've got TV crews , we 've got press , Internet ... What the ... ? If I see a cop within a hundred yards of this place , I kill everyone ! No , no , no wait ! Nobody has to die . Gates ! Stay here . Tell us what we need to know Mr. Randol ? Mr. Randol ! Shots fired ! All units , go ! You let them escape ? What the hell happened ? Damn-it ! Are you okay ? We gotta find them . Hey , get out there . You 're coming with me . Stay with the hostages . Hoyt , stick to the plan ! Bradley ! What the hell ? Hoyt ? Alec . Alec ! Hoyt ? Okay , tie him up , put him in the pantry , get Dillon on the phone . Tell him the house is clear and when the EMT 's get here , bring them to Carlos immediately . Okay . Alec , what 's going on ? I 'm going after Hoyt . They see us ! Cover ! Take a shot . Return fire ! We 've got gunfire being exchanged on the northeast corner . There 's a sniper in the storage barn . The bomb is in the barn , a stray shot could set it off . Hold fire on that position until you can get a clean shot . Roger . I just got a phone call from someone inside the house claiming the house is clear . Get your team to the house , see if you can recover the hostages . Roger that . We have now confirmed , a militant group headed up by Roland Randol have taken hostages on a Surrey farm . What 's going on ? Theseus . It 's started . ERT are on the scene and we 've had reportings of gunfire . Well , isn 't there something we should do ? They could kill him . We 'll have more as this story develops ... No , don 't worry . Everything I am , everything I become will be the result of the things unfolding on that farm . Get back ! Move , move , let 's go ! Alec , quick ! Get your mom . Mom ... Oh my God ! Get your mom . Oh my God . Check that those back roads are covered . Where are we on the hostages ? Approaching the house ... Move , move ! Go , go ! What are you doing here ? You said you were gonna leave . I came back to get you . What are you gonna do , take him hostage ? I 'm here to help you . If the cops find you they 're not gonna let you go , Dad . Son , look at me . Look at me . Listen to me ... just listen , okay ? Listen , if you want me to come with you , I 'll come . Okay ? No baby , don 't do this . Don 't ! Get out of the way . Hey ! What ? We can make a break for it . You go , you coward . We didn 't build a bomb for nothing . Don 't move ! Put the gun down , turn yourself in . You know that 's the only way this ends . I ... . I 'm warning you ! It ... just went off ! Julian ... This is the VPD , put your weapons down and come out ! Alpha one , Tango 's in the house . Positive ID , Randol . You made your statement , son . I understand , God ... You came back to save me and I will stand beside you , I swear to God I will , but ... It 's over son . There 's nowhere to run . It 's over son . I love you but please . No . Please . No . Please . I 'm so sorry . I 'm so , so sorry . No . It 's all my fault . No . I 'm so sorry . No ! No ! Target 's down , we got him . Don 't shoot ! That 's my mother ! What are you doing ? What are you doing ? You killed my husband . Guys , that 's my mother ! Identify yourself . I 'm Alec Sadler , this is Ann Roland , this is my mother . We 're unarmed . These are the hostages . Target terminated . He was not a target , he was my husband ! He was my husband . Where 's the other boy that was here ? Put your guns down now ! This place is surrounded . Hoyt , do as your friend is doing . It only takes one bullet to make a statement . We 'll all be martyrs . The message will be heard . Alec ? They 're done talking to your mom , you can go in now . How 's Carlos ? He 's critical ... but they 're taking him to the nearest hospital . I 'm so sorry about your dad . He 's my stepdad . Yeah . Should I go with him ? He 's in good hands . Why don 't you let me take you back to the precinct , we 'll get you debriefed . You okay ? Yeah . He 's out of surgery . Doctors say he tolerated , or whatever the hell that means . I hear Fonnegras are pretty hearty stock . They say his prognosis is good . Go home and get some sleep . Okay . Permission to come aboard ? These older scotches have a subtle smoky aftertaste that 's ... divine . Just take a sip . Or a , or a gulp . You uh , you in a hurry ? Well , that depends . Does this conversation come in interesting ? Hey , you 're the one that came to me . I seem to be present for all of your significant losses . Your grandmother , your sister ... You 've only got seconds . You 're gonna go to jail . I 'm not leaving you . - Get up . - Not yet ! Now I 'll go . I 'm sorry . You 're doing your job , right ? I mean ... you made it sound like it was your fault . Besides , what happened in the future stays in the future . Look , for what it 's worth ... I forgive you . Why ? Let me put it this way ... You and I will never be able to relate to these people the way we relate to each other . The two of us are in on a joke that 8 billion people others on the planet won 't ever get . I can think of a few others that might get it . Forget about them for a second . You know I 'm right . Why else would you be here ? Getting drunk . I 'm married . There you 're married . Here you 're alone . Like me . Tomorrow 's not promised , Kiera . Maybe it 's best to stop living for a future that might not even happen . Hello ? Do you recognize my voice ? Yes . Stay where you are . Within the hour I will have someone pick you up . They will give you clothes and food and a safe place to stay . Then we will meet .

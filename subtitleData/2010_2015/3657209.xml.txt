 Previously on Heroes ... You see what people want . Their desires , their hopes . - Got your power . - Isn 't that interesting ? I know why you can 't kill . Hiro { \ * Nakamura } said you 're going to die alone , and it 's haunting you . We all need people who understand us , care for us . - Who 's she ? - The love of my life . - He just shows up . - He 's stalking you ? - He does seem ... - Obsessed ? I had { \ * to act , } to protect you , to get you away from him . By kidnapping me ? You can never change the past . It 's bad , always ! Everything is connected . If you wanna change one thing , it 's all you do . { \ $ I must go back and undo the wrongs I have committed in my life . } I 've come back in time to save Charlie . And this time , I will defeat the brain man . { \ $ He 's not crazy . } { \ $ He has a brain tumor , and I think it 's getting worse . } There 's something I want you to see . It 's so magical , so beautiful . { \ * Just } Let me show you { \ * , that 's all } . If you 're still unhappy , I 'll take you { \ * right } back to California . Did they really think they were gonna get away with it ? - { \ * Forever ? } That we would just never find out ? - We shouldn 't have done it . I need time to grieve without being reminded why . { \ * Do } You wanna talk about it ? About what ? { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } Life among the carnies , the death of your father ... { \ * I mean , } { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } Either one of those would be enough to mess me up . I don 't think I 'd know where to start { \ * . I just } ... Think it 's one of those things I have to figure out by myself . Listen . I 'm not gonna pretend to know what you 're going through right now . But I want you to know that I 'm here for you . If you need anything . Anything at all . I have this review lesson thing . I moved it to Bapst hall , I have no idea where that is . East quad . Clear across campus . Of course it is . Excuse me . Is this seat taken ? { \ $ You sure you 're feeling okay ? You don 't look too good . } { \ pos ( 192,225 ) } { \ $ I 'm fine . Just thirsty , thanks . } { \ $ - Are you okay ? - Yes , thanks . } How 's it coming ? It 's ready . { \ * Now } Remember , it 'll only work in the hands of one of us . Luckily , you have Hiro and Ando now . You sure I can 't change your mind ? I broke a promise to a girl . I need to make amends . { \ * Well , } Then I guess this is it . In our lives , when is it ever ? Thanks , Mohinder . - Good luck . - You too , Noah . { \ * Well , } Gentlemen , I guess it 's up to us . Hello , carp . Adam Monroe ? But you are dead . - Am I dead ? - That 's for the judge to decide . - Judge ? - All rise . The honorable judge Kaito Nakamura presiding . { \ $ * } Be seated . { \ $ * } The world versus Hiro Nakamura , Your Honor . The what versus what ? { \ $ * } { \ $ * } { \ $ * } { \ $ * } { \ $ * } { \ $ * } Excuse me , is this professor Yanno 's review session ? Study group . Ready to brainstorm ? What the hell are you doing here ? I came to learn . How 'd you sleep ? { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } The dress is a gift . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } - If you wanna change into something ... - A gift ? { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } You kidnapped me , { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } brought me to ... { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } I don 't even know where we are because you won 't tell me . You 're right { \ * , I 'm sorry } . { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } I never meant to upset you . I 'll take you back home . Straight away . What ? What are you smiling about ? Your face . Just now ... It brought me back to when I broke your record player . { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } You had this one song you played over , and over { \ * , and over } . I was just kidding around , but I broke the arm . { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } - Remember ? - Yes . { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } - I remember . - Good . 'cause there 's something I still want you to see . { \ pos ( 192,225 ) } The only thing I 'm interested in seeing { \ pos ( 192,225 ) } - is my own front door . - { \ * But first , } Let me get you something to eat . { \ pos ( 192,225 ) } { \ * And } Then you 'll be rid of me for good , I promise . { \ pos ( 288,268 ) } This is how it always starts . Breakfast becomes lunch , { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } lunch becomes dinner , { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } dinner turns into drinks , and then ... { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } I fixed your record player . { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } I broke it and then I fixed it . { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } I know what I 've done wrong , and I know how to make it good . { \ * With } Scotch tape , and wire hangers , and loads of good intentions . Fine . Something to eat . Then you take me home . Good . Great . { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } He has a brain tumor . In the parietal lobe . { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } The doctors in Japan said it 's inoperable , but ... We may not have a choice . { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } - { \ * Please , doctor , } He 's my best friend . I can 't just ... - Wait here . - We 'll find out what 's happening . - Please help him . It is our intent to prove that the defendant abused his power { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } to bend space and time selfishly { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } and repeatedly for his own personal gain . And with a blatant disregard for the consequences on the space-time continuum . { \ $ } { \ $ } { \ $ } { \ $ } This is some bad dream or tumor hallucination . Let the record show { \ * that } the defendant { \ * fails to } won 't recognize { \ * the authority of } this court . This isn 't a court , it 's a diner . Perhaps your honor could enter a plea for the defendant if he refuses ? { \ $ } { \ $ } { \ $ } { \ $ } { \ $ } Mr. Monroe , please call your first witness . { \ $ } The prosecution calls Kimiko Nakamura . { \ $ } And Ando Masahashi . Do you know how much I would love to kill you ? { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } Listen ... - I know you must hate me . - You killed my father ! { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } It seems like a lifetime ago . { \ pos ( 260,268 ) } But I 'm a little off my game . - You 're gonna help me get it back . - Says who ? Says this . Your face showing up in ink wasn 't my choice . It 's destiny showing me my desire . { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } - { \ * And } You actually thought that I would ... - Relax . { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } They told me I needed connection . A friend . I don 't want to be alone . And somehow you 're supposed to help me . { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } I wouldn 't help you if my life depended on it . It 's not your life you should be concerned about . Let 's get this over with . - You don 't have to hurt Gretchen . - I promise you will see her again just as soon as you help me answer my question . Here is what I 've been thinking . You and me . We got a lot in common . We 're both adopted ... Abandoned by parents who didn 't want us . And raised by parents who didn 't understand us . - My parents understand me just fine . - Stop lying to yourself . Both of our dads were cold-blooded killers . Which is ironic , because you and I ... cannot ... be killed . I get it . Okay , we have a few arbitrary things in common . What is your point ? My point is they 're not arbitrary . They 're formative . The basic building blocks of our lives , and we have the same blocks . Yet , here we are ... Content college co-ed , and me . How did we end up so different ? You want to know what the difference is ? You 're a psychopath . Mystery solved . You think this is a game ? This is my life . You 're supposed to help me . Or don 't you care how many filets I slice your ... roommate into ? If { \ * you 're not gonna } you won 't contribute , I 'll just have to take the answers from your head . You 're gonna slice my head open again ? I 've evolved way beyond that . My friend Lydia gave me a much more precise instrument . She could read someone just by touching them . See into the very depths of their soul . Of course , her methods were a little hyper-erotic , but ... What the hell . It is college , isn 't it ? The dress suits you . What 's that ? A strawberry milkshake . Your favorite . That was a long time ago . How about this one ? The last time I crashed in your dorm room , we talked all night . Among other things . We talked about your dream home . That was the tequila talking . " A peaceful cottage surrounded by nature and happiness . " You 're such a romantic . Actually , that 's something I 've admired about you . But there comes a time when you have to realize that you 're never gonna have that cottage . Says who ? { \ * Can you honestly tell me you } Don 't you look back at our time together with a hint of fondness ? - What 's your prognosis ? - Not good . { \ $ } { \ $ } { \ $ } { \ $ } { \ $ } The witness has identified Hiro Nakamura , who 's clearly and selfishly interfered with the timeline . { \ $ } { \ $ } { \ $ } { \ $ } { \ $ } { \ $ } { \ $ } { \ $ } { \ $ } Just so I 'm clear ... On your personal scale of temporal justice , it 's okay , so long as no one gets hurt ? That is my definition . That 's good to know . Because I believe my next witness is here . Just tell me where she is . You 've been holding out on me . What are you talking about ? Why I was supposed to find you , you and I are the same . I am nothing like you . You do exactly what I do . You use this ... gift , this curse , whatever it is , to build walls . Make it impossible to actually connect with another person . Like Gretchen . { \ * God , all } Those memory hits { \ * I got } from your stuff while I was tying her up ... have such a different context now . Everything in that room is so full of ... Pauses . What did you say ? Pauses . All these moments so ripe with subtext . " Can I borrow your book ? " " Cut my hand with these scissors . " All these interactions , and you still can 't say the one thing you really want to say to this girl . Heck ... You keep this up , you might end up alone forever too . You don 't know what you 're talking about . I think I do . The indestructible girl who can 't put herself out there to get hurt . What ? No angry retort ? You 're right , you are off your game . You just told me exactly where she is . How many people have I killed ? Hundreds , I suppose . { \ * And } All of this because of an agreement you made with the defendant ? He told me if I saved the waitress I could have the cheerleader , and anybody else I wanted to kill . { \ * And } As long as you saved his girlfriend , you could kill some more . - Willy-nilly . - Willy-nilly . Seems to me that a lot of people were hurt as a result of Mr. Nakamura 's time tampering . { \ $ } { \ $ } { \ $ } { \ $ } { \ $ } Really ? Does this look right to you ? { \ $ } { \ $ } { \ $ } Tell me again , who else met their death by your hand after Hiro made this deal ? { \ * Well , } There was her . And Eden ... ish . Two Primatech guards . The melty guy , the mechanic , Isaac Mendez , my mother , some guy named Ted something ... { \ * Ted ... } And so on , and so on . If Hiro was acting out of an ability , Perhaps he should have stopped this vicious killer - Before these countless murders ... - Sprague ! Ted Sprague . So saving Charlie wasn 't for the heroic good . It was for the good of Hiro . Romantic or not , Charlie was a good person ! { \ $ } { \ $ } { \ $ } { \ $ } Fair enough . Then the prosecution would like to call its final witness . Charlie Andrews . { \ * Oh , } That 's right . { \ * I 've forgotten } I forgot we can 't bring Charlie in , because this world-improving person is lost in time . Now tell me , how did that happen again ? I made a deal with a ... I 'm sorry . You 'll have to speak up . I made a deal with a villain , and he double-crossed me . Right . Prosecution rests { \ * , Your Honor } . " A shake roof , wraparound porch , " and a stone path leading to a lake where the sun glistens over the water . " - How 'd you remember all of that ? - I have my ways . I know all the details . - By heart , it would seem . - Hard to forget . I was holding you close to me , and the way you painted it , It made it so real , like it came from your soul . { \ * Like ... } Like it was you . You always know the right thing to say . You have the perfect scrap of poetry in your pocket to ... To what ? " With a big oak tree in the yard , surrounded by wildflowers . " " And { \ * a couple of } rocking chairs on the deck to watch the sun set . " You { \ * do } remember . " With a fireplace to keep us warm . " " And a summer breeze to keep us cool . " How do you do it ? Every ... single ... time . This is so beautiful . How did you do it ? My friends and I can do the most amazing things . Look . There 's your dream cottage . No more traveling { \ * now } . We 'll make it a { \ * home . A } real home . For me , for you . If you 'll have me . You said you couldn 't join a carnival . And now you don 't have to . There 's no more carriage homes , no more main homes { \ * , just } ... Just that . Away from everything . It 's what you talked about . It could be our life . I can 't live here . - But you said ... - I know , I know what I said . It 's just ... - { \ * It 's just , } I didn 't think you 'd actually ... - Actually do it ? But ... I mean ... This dress , and the ... milkshake , and ... All of this , this is a ... - fantasy . - And I made it come true . For you . For you . This is your fantasy . And it 's ... it 's beautiful . And I 'm happy for you . But it isn 't me . My life isn 't here . - But I changed everything for ... - Don 't tell me you did all this for me . Please , don 't ... Don 't tell me this was all for me . Of course not . Listen , I should get you back home . Thank you for indulging me . No , it was really ... It was really nice to see you again . - Are you okay ? - I 'm fine . All things considered . I 'm so sorry , this is all my fault . You never should 've gotten caught up in it . I 'm just ... I 'm happy you 're here . And that it 's over . It is over , isn 't it ? He 's not done ... Somewhere out in the open ? { \ * No , } He 'll be expecting that , he 's trying to flush us out . How do you know ? 'cause apparently I get the way he thinks . - Someone 's coming ! - In here . Sylar ? The Sylar ? Yes . Well , no . Kind of the emo-apologist version . He 's had me trying to figure out what his issues are . Seriously ? How 'd that go ? Pencil in the eye . Listen , I 'm sorry . It 's okay . Getting used to being all perils of Pauline . { \ * No , } Not about that . Well , yes , about that . But ... About breakfast . About sometimes keeping you at arm 's length . It 's cool . Are you kidding ? - If you don 't want to ... - I do want to . I just ... I 'm scared . And I get afraid that I 'm gonna get hurt , and so I use my specialness to ... build these walls , instead of , you know , jumping off bridges . I suck at metaphors , but what I 'm trying to say is that ... It 's okay , really . No , it 's not . This guy , Sylar , he sat there and told me that we 're ... very much alike , and he 's not wrong . And I 'm afraid that I 'm gonna end up alone for the rest of my life like him . And I don 't know how to fix it . Do you want to talk about it ? I like to think of myself as Just a girl who ... happens to have powers . And it 's just one thing in a list of attributes ... Loyal , friendly , regenerative , good skin , you know ? You do have good skin . But when you put the chips down and life gets tough , I hide behind that one label , that one ... attribute . And I close myself off . Man , no wonder Sylar 's so messed up . I can only imagine what having a bunch of ... excuses could do to someone 's humanity . Maybe that 's his answer . In order to become human again , he has to get rid of all of his powers . Yeah , maybe . Now was that so hard ? You son of a bitch . Where is she ? It 's dinnertime . I imagine she 's right where you left her . You never took her ? Like I said , I 've been having a little trouble being myself . - You 're okay ! - Yeah ! Of course I 'm okay . Well , some guy stole my backpack , but ... - But what 's with you ? - Nothing , I 'm fine and then you 're here . And you 're all right . - You 're acting really weird . - I 'm sorry . I 'm really lucky to have you . And I 'm sorry about this morning . Forget it . You know me , impulsive Gretchen wants to hold hands so she does it . I know . { \ * And } I love that { \ * about you } . { \ * And } I wanna be more like that , and not be beholden to any label , or definition , or who I 'm supposed to be . I just ... I wanna hold your hand . - People are gonna start to talk . - Let them talk . Talking 's good . In fact , I could use some talking if you still have a sympathetic ear . I , in fact , have two ears . Come on . { \ * Please call your first witness . } { \ * The defense calls ... } { \ * Hiro Nakamura to the stand . } { \ * What ? } { \ * Have you seen " Law Order " ? } { \ * That always backfires . } { \ pos ( 290,220 ) } { \ * You have any better witnesses sitting around ? Because I don 't . } { \ * M.Nakamura , how long have you know the defendant ? } { \ * Seriously ? } { \ * All my life . } { \ * And what has been the driving force motivating you ? The whole life . } { \ * To be a hero . Noble and true . } { \ * And when you discovered your ability , } { \ * did you rob blanks ? } { \ * Or become famous ? } { \ * No . I promised to only use it for good . } { \ pos ( 192,40 ) } { \ * - And how has that worked out so far ? - I saved the world . } { \ * - Twice . } { \ pos ( 192,200 ) } { \ * And did you break your code doing so ? } { \ pos ( 192,200 ) } { \ * And did you even break it to save your own murdered father ? } { \ * No . I did not . } { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } { \ * So what changed ? } { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } { \ * I was weak . } { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } { \ * And desperate . For a meaningful legacy . } { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } { \ * So you found yourself a victim of the bad man 's con ? } { \ * I did } { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } { \ * And I found myself leaping frpm life to life , } { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } { \ * string to put right what once went wrong . } Objection , your honor ! He 's reciting the opening to quantum leap . { \ * Please wrap it up , M. Nakamura . } { \ pos ( 192,240 ) } { \ * Yes , I used poor judgement , } { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } { \ * but despite the sometimes disastrous effects , } { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } { \ * it was to make the world a better place ... } { \ * For family . } { \ pos ( 122,260 ) } { \ * And friendship . } { \ pos ( 302,260 ) } { \ * And love . } { \ * And if breaking my code for those things makes me guilty ... } { \ pos ( 192,240 ) } { \ * Then , I suppose I 'm guilty . } { \ * So be it . } We need to shock him . Give him 200 joules . { \ * Charging . } { \ * Guilty . } No response . - 240 . - Bring it up . Charging . Clear ! Still nothing . Start compression . We 're losing him . - Still no pulse , we 're losing him . - Let 's shock him again . { \ * I want to change my plea . } { \ * To " guilty . " } { \ * If this is the end , then I want to go out with honor . } { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } { \ * Doing the right thing . I want to go out a hero . } { \ * Go my son , } { \ * fight for your honor . } Not so fast , carp . { \ * Fight } { \ pos ( 192,240 ) } { \ * You can beat this . } { \ * The Hiro I know never gives up . } { \ pos ( 192,240 ) } { \ * He does whatever it takes . } { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } { \ * I 've seen him bend the very fabric of time and space . } { \ pos ( 192,240 ) } { \ * You are Super-Hiro ! } { \ pos ( 192,240 ) } { \ * Mother } { \ pos ( 280,240 ) } { \ * - I 've missed you so much . - As have I , son . As have I. } { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } { \ * And I 'm so proud of you for all lessons you 've learned . } { \ pos ( 192,240 ) } { \ * The tumor ... } { \ pos ( 192,240 ) } { \ * I tought I could fight it , } { \ pos ( 192,240 ) } { \ * that I could beat science ... } { \ pos ( 192,240 ) } { \ * but I can 't . } { \ pos ( 192,240 ) } { \ * Mother , I 'm ready to go . } { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } { \ * Some things are more powerful than science . } { \ * Like destiny . } { \ pos ( 80,260 ) } { \ * So ... you havent come to take me ? } { \ * I 've come to heal you . } - We got a pulse . - He 's coming back . He 's rising . Is something wrong , sir ? Yes , something is wrong . Am I scaring you ? Do I look scary ? Sir , I just { \ * wanted to know if } ... You don 't think I can see how you 're looking at me right now ? That I 'm different ? Looking down your nose at me ? Like I 'm not good enough ! I 'm done trying to change myself for you , Trying to fit into your world , Play by your rules . From now on , you 're gonna play by mine . - Can I help you ? - Hey . Hey , buddy . How are you ? I 'm sorry , I 'm Gabriel . A friend of matt 's , 12th precinct . I 'm sorry , he 's not here right now . { \ * Is there any way that you } Could you tell me where he is ?

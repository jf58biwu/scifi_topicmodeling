 Come back here . No ! Don 't ... No , don 't , don 't . All right . Ah . I got you . Talk to me , Goose . Goose ? Yeah , I 'm Maverick . Get it ? No . Tower , this is Ghost Rider , requesting a fly by ? You know , it kind of takes the fun out of things if I have to explain it . Oh , I can see how that could happen . Right . Did you find Grant 's flask ? Sort of . There 's just , um , one thing . One ? Try hundreds . Hundreds and hundreds of things . We 're looking for a flask at a Civil War re-enactment . A place where all flasks go to die . A world where everyone has a flask . Hey , that sounds like cannon fire . Brilliant . There 's that college education rearing its head . What do you want and why did you call ? Oh , right . Urgent . Do you know where Artie keeps the tiny little marshmallows ? Because he won 't tell me . Like he needs marshmallows . Right ? Hey , Pete ? Yeah ? Yeah , you know , that Artie . He 's , he 's looking pretty good these days , don 't you think ? It 's all the exercise I get chasing artifacts without any help . Sorry . Oh . Sorry . Man . Artie , that cold sounds like it 's getting worse . Does it ? You should be resting . That 's a very good idea . Resting . If only I were paying somebody to help me with this kind of thing . I know , right ? Well , Claudia will be back soon . Yeah , yeah . Oh ! Who made this thing ? Talk to me , Goose . Huh ? What , did no one see Top Gun ? Pete , there 's someone here to meet you . Oh , yeah . Sorry , Leena . I 'm kind of busy right now . She says she 's your ex-wife , Pete . Pete ? Hey , Myka . Twenty-seven hours to Dubai and back . And I know . I know that I should have gone to the Warehouse first . Myka . It was closer . I mean , the BB . Myka ... How did this even get to Dubai , anyway ? I mean , it 's not like Dubai looks like Dakota on the packing slip . Okay ? And . Is that me ? Oh , my God . I smell . I smell , don 't I ? Okay . So , shower . Shower and then nap and then Warehouse . Okay , but Myka , I have somebody that I 'd like you to meet . Myka , this is Amanda . Amanda Lattimer . Nice to meet you . Hi . Oh , it 's ... It 's so nice to meet you . I 'm Myka Bering . Amanda Lattimer . But you 're not Pete 's mom . And you 're not his sister . Because his sister ... Are you his cousin ? No . No , I 'm not his cousin . And I 'll be changing the name . I 'm his ... Amanda . Amanda . And , and ... And Myka ... You 're back . And . And you guys ... You guys have met . Oh . That 's great . Well , Amanda new-last-name was just telling me that she 's your not-cousin . She 's not . That 's right . Um . Amanda , Myka 's probably really tired , and ... No , I 'm fine . Need to shower . So . Let 's , uh , step over this way . Shall we ? But . Oh , here we go . Look at this room . I would just like to properly welcome your ... That 's rude . Okay , spill . So , what are you doing in the middle of South Dakota , Marine ? Oh , uh , I got ... I got reassigned . Reassigned . Here . From D.C. Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . That 's a punishment . What did you do this time ? No . No , no , no . Oh , please . No , I. No . I didn 't do anything . Mm-hmm . Well . No , wait . Uh , that 's ... Let me ... I did something . But it was a good thing , okay ? That 's why I 'm here . Well , whatever it was , I 'm sure it wasn 't intentional . Uh , no , it was . It 's a ... It 's a promotion . A promotion to Uni-ville . Univille . And what are you doing in Univille , anyway ? Oh . Oh . I found something that belongs to you . Shut it . Whoo-hoo-hoo ! Legend Makers , first edition ? Okay . How do you do that ? And just like that , you 're a 12-year old boy . Oh . I never thought that I would see this again . Thank you , thank you , thank you . Okay . Oh , man . Anyway . So , I should , um . I should go . Yeah ? Yeah . Okay . Okay . Hey , Amanda . Yeah . Are you going to tell me why you 're really here ? It 's disconcerting how well we know each other , isn 't it ? Um ... I 'm getting remarried . Wow . Remarried ? That 's awesome . That 's amazing . That 's terrific . Thanks . Congratulations . So , when is the wedding ? Tomorrow , actually . It 's tomorrow ! That 's . Oh , that 's tomorrow . I would have told you sooner , but , apparently , I have to get clearance to talk to my ex-husband now . You have no idea the kind of governmental hoops I had to jump through to get here . You know what ? I don 't know if I can get away on such short notice . Oh . Sorry . Pete , I , um ... I didn 't come here to invite you . I came to get my grandfather 's ring . Oh . The ring . The ring . That 's right . You know what ? I still have that . Sorry . Sorry . No , no , no . Please . Let me , uh . It 's , um . It 's upstairs . I 'll go get it . Okay ? Bless you . Oh . Oh , hi . Uh , sorry . Uh , I was just looking for ... Pete 's wife . I mean , you 're ... Ex-wife . Pete 's ex-wife . That we actually didn 't know he had . Just Amanda would be fine . And you are ? Oh , I 'm sorry . Sorry . I 'm Arthur . Artie . You don 't want to . I was actually just looking for Myka . Or Leena . Leena would do . How about me ? Would I do ? Oh , hi . Hey . He ... I wasn 't . I was looking for ... Me . He was looking for me because I 'm back . Right . Exactly , she 's back , I wanted to welcome her back . Well , now you 've seen her . You 've seen her . She 's seen you . Everybody 's seen everybody . So , now everybody is going to go . Here we go . Out the door . Bye-bye . So long . That a boy . Nothing to see . Nothing to see . All right , all right . Married ? You were married ? I don 't believe you . Can 't I have any privacy around here ? And you . Sneaking around . Me ? I 'm not sneaking . There was no sneaking . Sneaking . Married . I mean , how were you ... Okay , okay , okay . Show 's over . Pete is absolutely right . Myka , I am ashamed of you . Nosing around like that . This man needs his privacy . Married . Bless you . How could you not ... Go ! What ? Upstairs . Now . Go . Go . Move , move , move . Sorry about that . They 're , uh ... Curious . I was going to say " butt pains , " but , okay . Oh ! So , this is it , huh ? Our , uh ... Our reason for seeing each other . No , I guess this is it . Uh , look , Amanda . You pretty much missed out on the whole amends part of my life . I mean , not that you were exactly around , either . So , I guess I ... I guess I never thought that I was going to have to do this . Now that I hear it out loud , it 's ... It sounds like such a cop-out . The thing is , um , the reason that I never have is because you 're the hardest one to make amends to . I really screwed us up . Amanda , I 'm sorry . Thanks . And listen , Pete , it 's water under the bridge . You know , I think everything worked out for the best . I guess so . Now , what about this guy ? Was it ... It 's not ... It 's not anyone I know , is it ? Of course not . Oh , God . Thank God . But he 's the one , though , huh ? Yeah . He really is . I mean , not that you weren 't . It 's just ... It 's different this time . You know , Michael is sweet and charming . You had me at " yes . " So let 's ... Shut ' er down . Oh , I 'm just ... I 'm just excited about the wedding . I know . You know , fairy-tale , castle ... I mean , it 's a rented castle in the Poconos , but still . I 've been one of a few good men for a long time . So , I 'm ready to just be a princess for a day . Well , you deserve it . The prince and the fairy tale . All of it . Thanks , Pete . Yeah . Be happy , Amanda . I will be . Well , why was she here ? Alimony ? What . Are you two striking up the band again , or ... What ? No . She 's getting remarried . BOTH : What ? Stop . That 's why I didn 't tell you . Okay ? I don 't want to talk about it . Pete , you 're ... You 're right . I 'm sorry . Your private life is none of our business . We shouldn 't have intruded . You know . It wasn 't just one thing . I mean , mostly , it was because we were just too young . At least , I was too young . Amanda was ... She was very driven . She always knew exactly what she wanted . It 's what the Marines call a " hard charger . " Oh , man . She was amazing . I mean , of course she 's a major now . And I was not amazing . Uh . I didn 't know what I wanted , and I definitely wasn 't ready for a lifetime commitment . I mean , not then . Now , I just wonder . If it could have worked ? Yeah . No . Maybe . No . Uh . I don 't know . People ? We have a problem . One beehive , one bee . We are missing the bee . I don 't know what the bee does , but if it was in Warehouse 2 , we can bet it was probably something bizarre and deadly . We 'd better find it now . Okay , look . I came in here and I put the beehive right here . Right . Right . I remember , because ... You gasped . You rarely gasp . Pete 's right . Why did you gasp ? Leena ? Amanda . Amanda 's bag was right there . Pollen . If Amanda somehow triggered the latch then the bee could have fallen right into ... No ! No , no , no , no , no ! An artifact did not fall into my ex-wife 's bag on her way to her perfect fairy-tale wedding . No . That did not happen . Artie 's Law of Artifacts states the worst thing that can happen with an artifact will happen with an artifact . It 's in Amanda 's bag . Now you can panic . Amanda . Hey . There 's my future husband . Welcome back . I missed you . Hi . I missed you , too . Oh , look . I got the ring . Great . Ow ! You all right ? Yeah , just ... Oh , oh . There 's the bride , at last . And I need you talk to you about the caterer . I think he 's a complete idiot . Okay . I guess I 'll see you at the altar . Ooh . And after the whole hoopla with the inter-dimensional space , I realized what I really wanted was to be a Warehouse Agent . So , what about you ? What 's your story ? Oh , you know my story . ATF , Jimi Hendrix 's guitar , and the first time I saw Artie 's eyebrows . I mean , like , before all that . Well , before all that is the past . Which is where I 'd like to keep it . Oh . Well . Word of warning ? At the Warehouse , the past doesn 't always stay in the past . Literally . Did I mention we have a time machine ? Why doesn 't that surprise me ? Look , it isn 't here . Are you sure ? Silver flasks , gold flasks , wooden flasks , flasks with flaps , flasks with knobs . I get it . A lot of flasks . Look , we 've been through this trunk twice , and none of them match the description . So , why don 't we just shut this whole shindig down , we 'll flash badges , and we 'll body-search till we find it ? Because that 's not what we do ? I mean , Warehouse Agents , we use stealth . We 're stealthy . I mean , can you imagine how these nut-jobs will react when they find out that somebody has Ulysses S. Grant 's flask ? Guys carrying real bayonets . Exactly . And if one of them drinks from it , he starts believing that he 's fighting that war while he 's carrying a bayonet . Artie said at the last re-enactment ... I know . The re-enactor with the flask went postal and stabbed two soldiers . I know . But we still use stealth . Just really , really fast stealth . So then , what 's the plan , oh , stealthy one ? I ... Listen . I don 't exactly have a ... Oh . Why do I feel like Laverne ? Oh , no . You 're not Laverne . I 'm Laverne . You 're Shirley . I am not Shirley . I 've been doing a little digging to find out ... All right . To find out what this beehive artifact actually does . I 'm a little rusty on my hieroglyphics , so ... No age jokes , please . So , it may take me a little time . Okay , Artie . Just , just let us know . Wow . This is at lot nicer than the Love Me Tender Chapel in Vegas . Oh , tell me you didn 't ... Oh , yeah . Yeah . BRIDESMAID 1 : That is the dress . Oh , my gosh . Wait . You were supposed to bring something blue . Wait , wait , wait , wait . No . I was supposed to bring the garter . No , I was the garter . You got it all confused . Ow . Oh , Amanda , You look so beautiful . This thing is getting worse . Look at that . Oh , God . What did you do ? On your wedding day . Amanda , what 's wrong with you ? Amanda ? You poor thing . I 'll get you a band-aid . Triple antibiotic . You need triple antibiotic . Okay . Marines ! Ten-hut . Major . Amanda . You look great , Major . I 'm so glad you made it . Sir , you look fantastic . Oh . Thanks , Scott . It 's " ma 'am . " So glad you guys are here . You should sit down and rest , Major . Put your feet up . No , I 'm okay . Thanks . You need to conserve your energy I 'll get you a chair . No , I 'm good , guys . Excuse me . Pete . Myka , right ? What are you doing here ? Wow . You , you , you look ... Wow . Amanda , we 're really sorry to intrude . But , um ... We have a little problem . Um . Can we talk to you for a minute ? So , what 's with the parade ? Is this what happens when you become an officer ? It 's the bridal party . Marines take their jobs seriously . Hey , I was a Marine . I was never a stalker . Okay . Is there somewhere we can talk privately ? Oh . Oh , no . It 's Michael 's parents . His mother doesn 't know how to end a sentence , let alone a conversation . Just do me a favor . I have to talk to my friends for a minute . So , just take care of the Martins for me . All right ? I don 't care what you have to do , just keep them away from me . Let 's go in here . Hello . What 's going on ? Is this some sort of Marine thing ? We 're looking for our son . So , what is the problem ? We can 't tell you . Why not ? We can 't tell you . It 's just that , when you were at the BB , something got loose . " Got loose " ? What kind of something ? Uh . We can 't tell you that , either . Pete , if this is about me getting remarried ... What ? Wait , wait . What ? No . Okay ? Scout 's honor . You were kicked out of the Scouts when you were 10 . I did not start that fire . Look , Amanda . Trust me . This isn 't about you . Then , why are you here ? Look . It 's " need to know , " Major . And you don 't need to know . Fine . Fine . Whatever this problem is , what are you going to do to fix it ? Or can you not tell me that either ? We just need to search your bag . It 's actually that bag . Pete ? It 's a great dress . Really . Sorry . My Sandy Alomar , Jr . Signed baseball ? Backup plan . I wasn 't sure the comic book would work . So , does this have something to do with your new job ? Why you 're in Uni-ville ? Univille . So , you weren 't lying . It really is a promotion . Ha-ha ! Behold . Bee-hold . Behold . All right . All right . Yeah . Um . You might , uh . You might want to duck . Well , there you go . Bam . Well . No dead bodies , no mass destruction , no swarm of killer bees . Although , I 've got to tell you , it did cross my mind . So much for Artie 's law . What was that ? Some kind of weapon ? Uh , that is your wedding being saved . Okay . So , the good news is , is that it is over . All right . Then , thank you for taking care of whatever that was . Yeah . Yeah , uh , no worries . Listen . Uh , we 're sorry to barge in like that . And , uh . You shalln 't see me again . Pete . Um , could I talk to you for a second ? I 'm going to go see if there 's a moat . I hope there 's a moat , because I really , I love moats . She loves moats . Well , now that we 're stealthy , do you have any ideas how to find this flask in a hay stack ? I don 't know . Mingle ? See if there 's anyone here taking this whole re-enactment business too seriously ? Run , you scurvy Yank ! Run ! I kind of think showing up covers that category . Okay . Nix the negativity . All right , Zen Master ? Think of it like when you were a kid . You know ? Get into it . Oh , what ? There was no make-believe in your mysterious past ? I say we hoist a musket and enter the fray . And I say that we talk to that guy . Did you know the guy who hit you ? It was Private Johnson . The guy went crazy . Right in the middle of the skirmish . Started punching other players and hitting them with the butt of his rifle . I mean , we have rules against that sort of thing . Was he drinking out of a flask ? Well , I. You know , I suppose so . I mean , we all are . That 's about half the fun . You 're dead , rebel . Huh ? So are you , Yank . Long live Abe Lincoln . What ? I 'm getting into this . Hey , lie down . You 're dead . Huh ? No . Oh , no . I 'm not dead . I 'm just . I 'm just wounded . Yeah . Oh . Oh . In the leg , I think . Yeah , it 's ... It 's cool . I can still fight . Hey . Do you know how much it cost to defoliate these trees to make it look like the Battle of Shiloh ? We 're committed professionals . And you , rebel dog , are dead . All right . Don 't get your long johns in a bunch . I 'm going . So , now , if you 're dead , does that mean you 're still the Senior Agent here ? Just find Johnson . Look for the craziest guy out here . So , Pete . I just wanted to say that , um . I 'm sorry , too . What you said back in Uni-ville ... Univille . Stop that . Right . It wasn 't all your fault . It was easy at the time to blame your drinking , but it takes two to screw up a tango . Yeah , well , I was never really much of a Pacino . I was more of a Tom Cruise , you know ? Yeah . You 're Maverick . I remember . Thank you . The thing is ... Back then , I just ... I just wanted so much . Wanted to do so much . And I couldn 't let anything get in my way . Including you . Maybe if I hadn 't been so headstrong ... Who knows , huh ? Yeah . But , hey . Look at you now , Major . You 've got your Cinderella dress . I 've never seen you look happier . I think ... I think things worked out exactly the way they were supposed to . Amanda , have you seen my parents ? I can 't find them anywhere . Hey . Hey . Aren 't you ... Isn 't he ... Uh , Pete . Yeah . Pete . Yes . Glad you could make it . Good to finally meet you . Hey . Oh , well , you just had to be nice , didn 't you ? Pete was ... Listen , Michael . Uh . You got yourself a fine little Major there . So . Thank you . Why don 't you and I go find your parents ? Yeah . I am just dying to chat with your mom . So , that was the groom , huh ? Yeah , can you believe it ? Well , your ex definitely has a type . What ? You think that guy looks like me ? With the hair and the square jaw and the Captain America attitude ? Please . I 'm so much cooler than that . It 's the weirdest thing . My folks , they just disappeared . We 'll find them , Michael . All right ? Nobody gets in or out of here until we do . I 'm going to go look for them . You just stay here and do whatever it is that brides do . Okay ? Mm-hmm . And when we find them , at exactly 1500 hours , come hell or high water or in-laws or exes , we are getting married . And then , I 'll finally be Mrs. Michael Martin . And I will finally own you , woman No one gets in or out of here . I will finally own you , woman Come on . Let 's go . Okay . Whoa . Hi . Excuse us . Nobody in or out . That 's what she said . Okay . Look , Marines , there 's no reason to get worked up here . We were just leaving , and I ... Pete ? I 'm all right . No . No . I mean , Pete . Nice hats . Run ! Help me . Hey . Artie 's Law . Oh , yeah . " It 's a wedding , Pete . Why would need our teslas ? " What is this , Pete ? Where did the rest of them go ? What the hell is happening ? Michael is out there and his parents ... I 'm sorry . But right now , I 'm worried about the guys with swords . Spit it out , Lattimer . I assume this is all being caused by your little top secret whatever-it-is . I told you " need to know . " Given that we 're being attacked by my own wedding party , I 'm pretty sure I need to know . The , uh , beehive artifact once belonged to a female Pharaoh who ruled Egypt around 1479 BCE . Hatshepsut . Bless you . Uh , what ? No . That wasn 't a sneeze . That was actually the female Pharaoh 's name . Uh , Hatshepsut . So , Hatshepsut created the artifact using the pheromones of honeybees . Well , beehive , bee . It makes sense . Yes . And then , she would prick herself with the bee , and then , inject the stinger really , into her body . She became the Queen Bee . Precisely . Ah . What about her ? What about who ? You . You just said Hatshepsut . Oh , no , now , that was a sneeze . Wait . You . You said " stinger . " Artie , you did say " stinger . " Okay , Artie , I 'm looking at this bee , and there is no stinger . Die , scum ! Come on , you rebel dog . Dude , what the hell ? I shot you . Come on , you rebel dog . Fight like a man . Oh , man . Put the gun down . I killed you . You mock me , traitor . But I shall be victorious for my great country ! No , no , no . I have come to aid you , brother . Together , we will ... To hell with this . Hey ! Johnson , listen . I 'm not actually a re-enactor . The truth is , you 've got something very dangerous . Die , scum ! Stop ! Stop , sir , I beg of you . You would not raise your hand against a lady , would you ? I would never harm a woman . But I intend to kill this scurvy grayback . Afraid not . Told you I was Laverne . Such a Laverne move . Come on , Shirley . Come on . What ? Oh , the mini-tesla ? It 's my own design . It 's pretty cool , huh ? Dude , that should be your drag name . Minnie Tesla . Okay . They have these outfits for the female re-enactors . I figured if I could ... What ? What . What did I do ? No . Uh , no , no , no , no . It 's not . It 's . It 's nothing . It 's not you . It 's just that , for a ... Second there , you were a lot like my big sister . You know , she used to save my butt a lot when we were little . So , you do have a past . And a sister . Well , tell . What 's she like ? Where does she live ? What does she do ? Details . No , she ... She died , Claud . A while back . How do I always do that with you ? God . I 'm sorry , Jinksy . It 's okay . Really . It 's , uh . It 's all good . Right . Well , let 's , um ... Snag it and bag it and get the hell out of here . What else do you have in there ? I 've got a PB and J if you 're hungry . Forget I asked . Damn Trekkies . Always crashing the party , pretending they 're time travelers . What a nerd . Tell me you found it . Sort of . Uh , Amanda 's been stung . Did she touch anyone ? Aside from her whole bridal party , no . I 'm thinking the finger is the source of the infection , so don 't let her touch anyone else with it . Artie , we checked her finger . There 's no sign of the stinger . Yeah . It , it makes its way through the body . It targets the glands , and it causes the pheromone production . Then , whenever she touches anyone , she immediately creates these worker bees who become slavishly devoted to her every need and protection . Is that why they 're chasing us ? Well , you know , probably . Because you 're seen as a threat . And , wait , wait , wait , wait . Yes . Yes . It appears that things went very badly for Hatshepsut . You know , I must say , I 'm . I 'm rather impressed with how quickly my , uh hieroglyphic reading skills have come back to me . Artie , just please figure out how to get the stinger out . Consider it done . I 'm going to go find Michael . Wait . No , no , no , no , no , no No . It 's . It 's too dangerous , okay ? Everything 's going to be fine . I promise . We 'll figure this out even if I have to ... X-ray . That 's what we 'll do . We 'll x-ray her . It will show us where the stinger is . All we have to do is get her to the hospital , find the stinger , and get it out . That 's great . That 's a great idea . I don 't suppose you packed any tear gas to get past the homicidal bridal party , did you ? I left it in my other pants . WOMAN : Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! What are they doing ? What are they doing ? Well , don 't look at it . We 'II ... We 'll fix it later . First , we 've got to get out of here . Come on ! Those chairs are rented . Amanda ! Come on . Amanda ! Amanda ! Michael ! Michael , stop ! As your pharaoh . " Pharaoh-ess . " I command you to stop . Hup . Hup . Hup . Obviously , that means something completely different in ancient Egyptian . Hup . Hup . Hup , hup , hup . I give up . When it comes to this ... Boogedy-boogedy ? Yeah . When it comes to the boogedy-boogedy , I 'm pretty sure you outrank me . Hey , Artie ? Oh , Major . That 's so sweet . So , what 's the plan ? The plan . Right . Right . The plan . I will tell you the plan . I just have to ask Myka a question first . What 's the plan ? Oh . Artie , what 's the plan ? Why wouldn 't they listen to their queen ? Amanda gave them an order . Well , Hatshepsut tried the same thing . But , by then , her subjects had become so obsessively devoted to her that they just took it on themselves to protect her from anyone . But Michael 's her fiancé . Yes , well , her husband-to-be , most of all . Because as a male he would have taken her place as Pharaoh if they had gotten married . What did they do to him ? They ... I think it says " mummified him alive , " but ... I 'm a little loopy from the cold medicine . No ! Amanda , no ! That sounds bad . Uh , call me back . Hey , look out ! Oh ! Oh ! Sandy . Thanks . Don 't thank me . Go save my fiancé . That 's something you rarely hear your ex-wife say . This time , stay down . Shouldn 't you be seating people ? Pete , look out ! Ten-hut ! Really ? I found it . Use the bee . It 's a magnet . It will draw the stinger out at her left clavicle . Hey , hey , hey ! I said ten-hut ! About face ! We 're on our own , kiddo ! Okay . Now , this may hurt just a little . Ha ! And ... You know , I would have just sent you the ring . Yeah . Next time . Next time ? There was a bit of a problem with the , um the bridal party . Mushrooms . Yeah . Yeah . Uh , everybody ate wild mushrooms at the rehearsal brunch , and kind of went on a bad trip . So , it 's , uh . Dearly beloved , we are gathered here today ... You know , I was really hoping I 'd hate you . Pete . Pete . Ow ! What ? What ? What I was trying to say was I wanted to hate him , but then , I saw him take on those Marines with the chair . That was ... That was epic . This one ? This one , right here ? Distinguished Valor in Combat Using Rental Furniture . Ah . Nice . Okay . So , this wasn 't exactly the , um , fairy-tale wedding that I had pictured . But it was , um , memorable . Yes . Thanks , Pete . And listen , whatever it is that you two do , it 's exactly what you were meant to be doing . You 're a good team . All right . Well , uh . At ease , Major . Although I 'd have been a Colonel by now . Oh . Oh . Huh ? What ? Ouch ! Bye ! Bye . And there we go . Hey , um . So , listen , I just . I want to say I 'm sorry for not telling you about Amanda . I should have . No . It 's none . It 's none of my business if you ... I mean , it wasn 't the marriage that I was trying to keep secret . It was me . Um , the guy I was before . You know , Pete , the drunk . Pete , the loser . You don 't have to ... No , Myka , it 's true . It 's , um . You 've never met that guy , and I don 't ever want you to . You know ? I want you and Artie and Claudia and everyone here to know the Pete I am now . Fair enough . Okay . Hey . Hey , Pete . That , that new husband , Michael ? He 's a tool . That 's , um ... That 's why I joined the ATF . Uh , I didn 't ... I was just ... I 'm sorry . I 'm really sorry , Steve . It 's okay . She , um ... She was 20 . She was your age . I shouldn 't have been digging around . You don 't have to talk about it if you don 't want to . No , I think that I want to , Laverne . You would have liked her . Yeah , I think you two would have been good pals . God , she was , um ... Such a hero to me . She was funny and smart and she was always , always there for me . There was , uh , this one time . Jeez , you know , I think that you would have done the exact same thing . We were ... We were at the park . We were shooting hoops . She was , uh , she was short , but she had this amazing lay-up . And these kids came , and they were going to beat the crap out of us . And she disappeared . And then all of a sudden , she ...

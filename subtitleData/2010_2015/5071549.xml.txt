 This has one number on it - mine . I was given to a man called Christos . He taught me how to steal , how to fight . They caught him , tortured him , killed him . What was my name ? Your name was Pietre . Get out ! Jesus Christ ! It was chemical poisoning ! Not flu at all ! I have copies with lawyers . I want Anya released . I need to see you . I 'm in trouble . That 's not me ! That is not me ! See if he 's got the Chinese character for " rabbit " on his belly . Then what , whack him ? We go now ! And we take him with us . I want the manuscript and you are going to take me to it . Of course . That 's why I 'm here . Do you have it ? What , no kiss first ? So , you 're getting tremors . It could be psychosomatic . Or the Deel 's could be activating . Thoraxin 's an experimental drug , it 's hard to gauge its efficacy . Then why am I taking it ? Because there 's every chance it 's keeping you alive . You know , when Jessica handed them the manuscript , she didn 't give them it all . She ripped out a few pages . She must 've given them to someone . Grant ? Now , Becky , if you get me those pages , I can get them to someone who can help , someone who can expose this . How do you know she did that ? I keep telling you , I know people ! That 's why you need to stick with me . Hang on ! I can always get you what you need . Where 's the rest ? That 'll last me a day or two , where 's the rest ? Get me those pages . If you want to keep control of your fucking limbs . Got our supplies . Have you seen Alice yet ? Yeah , she 's over there with Grant , acting as if nothing happened . Is that the vaccine ? You really think this kills people ? What about Letts ? Have you checked ? No . We were waiting for you . Fancy a chat later , Grant ? There 's something we need to talk about . How are you , Alice ? Do you want to talk ? No , thank you , Becky . Do you ? Well ? Are we going to talk to him ? Right , you do it . Why me ? You 're a bloke ! It 's not Mr Rabbit . Shit . The child ... did she kill Monroe ? Yes . Why were you going to see him ? To warn him . I always ... liked him . Could I have more water , please ? Where were you taking the vaccine ? To a laboratory . For testing . And you do that ? Yourself ? Well , I ... am a scientist . Or is that just to stop anyone else seeing what 's in it ? We know about the GCHN1 protein . We know about Janus . Then why are you talking to me ? Because we 're curious to know which race it is you want to murder . Is that what you think is going on ? Are you laughing ? Laughing , is it ? Please ... - Who is it this time ? - Please don 't hurt me . The white ones ? The brown ones ? Not the Jews ' turn now , then ? - We 're not that ! - Yeah ? See this eye ? Your men pulled it out of my head with a fucking spoon ! And they killed my dad ! Why ? Wilson ! Who have you lost , eh ? She 's lost someone , Alice has lost her mum , who have you fucking lost ? I want to know why they 're doing this ! Wilson ? Your name is Wilson ? And you must be Ian . And you 're Becky . How do you know that ? You were given a phone ? It contains a tracking device . They know where you are . We always have . Oh , my God ! I 've been abandoned . Does she want the child ? Er , I don 't know . I don 't think so . The people who , er ... employ her , I think it 's caused trouble . I 'm sorry ... Employ ? ! The people who employ her ? You mean the pimps who trafficked her ? The filthy criminals who were bribing us and who you gave our money to when you wanted to fuck her ? I can 't even look at you ! This , er ... .. thing you have over these people , will it make us safe ? Yes , it makes us safe . Because we want a child . It 's your child and it ... Is it a boy or a girl ? It 's a boy . And he needs a home . I think I 've found it . It 's wired in the battery , so it transmits when the phone 's off . So Milner knows we 're there ? No . Hang on . I mean , are we sure ? Does she know ? - Of course she knew ! - Who gave her the phone ? Ian , she 's tracking us . They 're not here cos they 're waiting for the manuscript . Doesn 't make sense . She saved us , got Grant off the hook . What 's the point ... ? Have you felt any tingling yet ? Tremors ? I 'd be grateful if you told me . I worked so hard on Deel 's . What 's your blood pressure ? I 'm not after a fucking check-up ! Why ? Why 'd you do this ? We weren 't interested in what Deel 's did to the subject . We just wanted to know if we could engineer a change that could be passed on . And we did . As an experiment ... it was a success . Success ? Did you just ... ? My father died of this ! I 've done so many terrible things . But what we are doing is right . Did you ... did you say right ? Brown people , white people , Jews ... I assume you 're referring to Carvel 's supposed paper on eugenics . But Carvel was misunderstood . Yeah , just like Hitler . He wasn 't talking about race , he was talking about survival ! We 've now passed seven billion on this planet . When I was born it was a little over two . Food prices are rising , oil is ending . When our resources end in 20 years , given everything that we know of our species , do you really think we 're going to just share ? So your answer to that is some kind of genocide ? No , it is not ! It is not genocide . Our answer to this is Janus . Janus consists of a protein and an amino acid . Independent of each other , they 're harmless . But when they 're brought together in the subject they act as a genetic trigger that prevents chromosomal division . The cell targeted can no longer replicate itself and is thereby rendered useless . The change is permanent . And hereditary . And which cells are targeted ? Those that control fertility , Becky . The purpose of Janus is to sterilise ... The purpose of Janus is to sterilise the entire human race . They 've got Letts ? Yes . I believe Letts had the vaccine with him . - What ? - No need for panic . Carvel 's work is almost in our hands . Let 's not lose that by being rash . This civil servant of yours is much more worrying . You 've handled him badly . He now has the capacity to expose us . He 's a fucking civil servant , I didn 't expect him to take risks ! Perhaps you should end him ? He would have prepared for that . End him ! Don 't give me orders , do you understand ? I am a Minister , and I don 't take orders from you ! I 'll deal with him . You need to deal with this . Deal with this ? How ? By getting Letts back . Back ? Why on earth would we want him back ? Janus effects 90-95 % of the population , leaving only one in 20 fertile . We predict the population will plateau at 500 million in just under 100 years . By then , normal breeding rates should resume ... .. but on a planet that will feel ... empty . You 're fucking insane ! To do nothing is insane ! You accuse us of being genocidal . Not acting is genocide . Where do you think your food comes from , Ian ? A third of the world 's farmland is now useless due to soil degradation , yet we keep producing more mouths to feed . And what 's your answer to that ? Energy-saving light bulbs ? But we 're doing things . We 're changing things . Do you know the person who had the greatest positive impact on the environment of this planet ? Genghis Khan , because he massacred 40 million people . There was no one to farm the land , forests grew back , carbon was dragged out of the atmosphere . And had this ' monster not existed , there 'd be another billion of us today jostling for space on this dying planet . Yet Janus massacres no-one , it 's without violence . This is why you did this to me . This is why you killed my dad ? It is . And there are a thousand other crimes on my conscience . But do you know what I see , Wilson ? A planet turned into a desert . A thousand million souls starving , dying . And we can stop this . With Janus . Why are you telling us this ? It 's not just to save yourself , you could have said anything to save yourself . What we have is an approximation . We are not Carvel , we don 't have his genius . We 'll know within three months whether a version of Janus works . Then we 're poised to repeat it across the globe ... If it works . But there is one way of making sure . Get us the manuscript . You 're asking us to help you ? Not me . Humanity . All over the world people are helping , good people . If we had the manuscript , we ... Right , you need to stop talking . Not to do this is to condemn billions to starvation and misery ! We need to find out if Milner 's with them . If she 's not , then we need to get that vaccine to her . Why ? I mean ... what he 's saying , it ... isn 't that ... .. right ? Right ? Sterilising the human race ? One in 20 will remain fertile . You shut up ! We should we at least think about it . No , Wilson , we should not fucking think about it ! We need to stop him , now ! Cos if they are right , and we stop them ... .. then what does that make us ? Wilson , they killed your dad . They tortured you . That 's who they are . You need to go there . There 's no cameras but you will have to uncuff me . Shut up . If you don 't give the manuscript to me I 'll have no hesitation in shooting your ankles , shins , knees . I will make you talk and if I have to do it in there , I will . OK ? What now ? We talk to the man . Where ? The counter . Eggs , beans , chips , sausage , bacon , two toast and a cup of tea . You ? Twice . You think this is funny ? They 'll be after us . We need to eat . Keep up strength . Rule number one , you know that . Don 't worry . I always come here , they know me . It 's my local . Eat . I bought it for you . It 's good . It 's nice to talk to you in person . I 've always wanted to . I 'm a fan . I 've read the manuscript , Jessica . I know what kind of man your father was . What about Christos ? Did he love you ? I think a child needs love . My name 's ... My name 's Pieter . This is disgusting . Only a dog would eat this shit . It 's slop . And it 's a fucking roadside cafe by the way . This is no-one 's ' local ' . They don 't know you here at all . You 're cranky . Do you get those dreams a lot , Jessica ? Finish ... we are going . I need to go toilet . I need to do the other one . There might be some noises . You wanted to talk , Becky ? Yeah , maybe later , Grant . The hardest thing is not knowing . Isn 't it ? Constant question . Will today be the day it triggers ? What will it feel like when my throat closes for the last time ? I could squeeze your neck so easy ! Is the thoraxin working ? Donaldson told us he was supplying you . I thought you 'd slept with him for the thoraxin . But ... now that I 've met you , Becky , now that I know you , I realise that it must have been so much more complex than that . You don 't know me . He wants to sell us the manuscript . But I would much rather it be you that benefits . Get it to us and we 'll take care of you . We 've got a plan . You want to take the vaccine to Milner ? Not to her . We 'll leave it outside . You and me go in . We find out whose side she 's on and then we decide . You and me ? What about Wilson ? I want to ... talk to Letts . What are you going to do ? He 's right at the heart of this . He must know the name of Mr Rabbit . What ? No . I can 't . We can 't start doing stuff like that . He 's talking to save his own skin . He needs ... persuading . Fuck . What ... then why you ? Because I know what it feels like . Take Alice and Grant . It 's best they 're out the house for this . You stay here with the vaccine . OK ? Are you sure this is the right thing to do ? No . Not really . What 's the worst that could happen ? She could kill us . Or hand us over to them , to kill us . Or torture us . Jesus Christ ! Did you break in ? We tried to contact you . You didn 't answer . They 're on to me , for Christ sake , I can 't just ... It 's not what you think . You knew ? You 're with them ? It 's not as simple as that . I 'm working with them , yes . But I 'm not on their side . How do you think I stay alive ? Don 't fucking move ! Don 't you move . You gave us away . Because I knew they 'd do nothing . They are not interested in you , they want the manuscript , they want ... I was supposed to encourage you to get it from Jessica and when you had it , I was to hand you over . Jesus Christ ! Which I 'm not going to do . We trusted you . And you lied to us . Give us one good reason why we should believe you now ? One ? One reason ? This is Jake . My son . Yes , Becky , it 's Deel 's . I told you about his father . Part of the investigation meant going undercover at Corvert , where they gave him Deel 's . Just like your dad , Becky . Jake 's triggered about 18 months ago . He 's done remarkably well but ... the last six months ... It 's just a matter of weeks now . Now do you believe me ? So we can give you the vaccine , then ? I mean , you said if we had proof ... We can 't . They know about her . He 's right . What I did for Ian alerted them . I understand they are coming for me tonight . It 's OK . I 've got Jake this far , he won 't mind going now . I have , erm ... I have something we can take . Jesus Christ ... What do we do with the vaccine ? Ian , they are going to kill her . There 's a man at the Department of Health ... Michael Dugdale . MI5 routinely monitors advisers and his behaviour has been ... I think he 's with us . Get the vaccine to him . I think he might be on our side . No , I mean ... You 've got to run ! Jake can 't run and I 'm not leaving him . Jake and I would like a few moments on our own before ... Best to go out the way you came in . Look , I 'll take it to this guy . You better get back to Wilson . I 'll take Grant . He 's bound to recognise him . I suppose I better take Alice , too . Becky ... You don 't know it 's triggered . That may never be you . How 's Jen ? Devastated . But still alive ? Look , I 'm trying to protect you . What we did to you last night was the start of an unimaginable nightmare . Stop being so stupid , you are tiny . If I give you what I have , you 'll kill me . So I 'm going to keep it . And you 're going to buy my silence . 350,000 every year . Make it look like a trust fund from some unknown aunt . That way , I 'll have an incentive to keep quiet . This ... .. might be acceptable . And I want Anya out of prison today . Jen and I want to meet with her this afternoon . As you wish . This might turn out nicely after all . It 's not easy , is it ? Growing up without a childhood . I was brought up in an institution . My room was a cell , really . There was an air-vent there . I drew pictures around it , faces to keep the devil out . I was told I 'm like this because of early trauma . I disconnected . A beneficial side effect , I suppose . I know this place . It was me . I killed Christos . I tied him to that tree . I broke arms and fingers , tore the skin from his body . And in the end ... I opened his stomach , reached inside and pulled out what was in my hand . I was 15 years old . But he didn 't say one word . He didn 't speak . He didn 't say where you were . That 's how much he loved you . I wanted you to know that you were loved . Because I wasn 't . You can kill me now and get revenge for Christos or I can take you to the manuscript . I can take you to what 's left of your father . But I won 't do it at the point of a gun . You have to trust me . Throw away the gun . Or it stops ... here . I don 't need a gun to kill you . The minute you hand it over , I will rip the life from your body ! Wilson ... Wilson , what have you got there ? Wilson , I thought I detected ... .. a certain sympathy with our views and you wouldn 't be alone . Wilson , please , please . Please don 't do ... Do you want money ? I 'll give you money . I 'll give you whatever you want . Wilson , please , don 't do it . Please . You 're right . It 's better than genocide . Follow the path for about half an hour until you get to an A-road . You 'll know what to do from there . I 'll make it look like you escaped . That 's my assistant 's e-mail . He 's the one . If you get the manuscript , contact him . Argh ... Argh ! Argh ... Argh ! You are having my husband 's baby . Today ... .. new evidence is coming to light and you will be free by morning . I , I will be free ? Yes . You will be free and you can do whatever you like , I promise . But what we would like , what we propose , is that you come with us . With you ? I don 't understand . We want to find you a flat , and you 'll be safe there for the entire term of your pregnancy . You will have the best care we can get for you , I promise . And , when you have the baby ... .. we would like you to hand over the child to us . We will pay you £ 250,000 . My husband ... My husband is ... .. weak . But he will make a very good father . And I will love your child more than you can imagine . I promise . Can I see my baby ? No . No , that is part of the deal . You can never see your child again . Where are we ? That street ... leads to a building they used to use . Old research base . Abandoned now . The manuscript . I hid it in there . Have you got your seat belt on ? - You OK ? - Where 'd you get that gun ? The cafe , toilet cistern . Let 's go . They 'll have only just set that up . We 've got a little time before they move in force . Jesus Christ ! You prepared all this ? It 'll keep them back ! This was where I grew up . This is called tonalite gneiss . It 's the oldest rock in the world . From a rock plateau in Canada . Where did you get that ? He used to say , " This rock gives you permission to do anything , " because , ultimately , we 're all just the blink of an eye . " I was the first person he experimented on . He looked for the nearest human who wouldn 't talk . His son . I don 't believe you . But his experiments went wrong . No ... And I was changed . Into this . This isn 't possible . The manuscript 's here , but I 'm warning you not to take it . Don 't do what I did . Don 't find out the truth about our father . Give it to me . You look more gorgeous every day ... Jesus Christ ! Stop that ! Why 's everybody hitting me ? You 're selling it ? ! You 're selling it to them ? ! You only want it from me so you can give it to them ! OK , yes , all right , I should 've told you , but I fully intended to split the money ... It sterilises people , d 'you know that ? And you just want to make money from it . " Just make money " ? Did you say , " Just make money " ? If they do this , it 's social and economic Armageddon . What d 'you think it 'll be like getting old if there are no young people to pay for it ? Do you think there 'll be pension plans , healthcare , free fucking bus passes ? In the future , if you 're old , you 're dead , unless you have wealth . So instead of stopping it , you just want to make money ? Stop it ? Why should I want to stop it ? They 're right , of course they 're right . We have to do it . You 're disgusting . And I will never give you one part of Utopia . OK . OK , but tomorrow at noon , I 'm going to be here with every ounce of Thoraxin I have . Get me those pages , you get it all . Enough to keep you going for years . But if you 're not here at midday , Becky ... .. I tell you , I 'm going to throw the whole fucking lot in that lake . Michael Dugdale ? Yeah ? I 'd like to talk to you . About the Russian flu vaccine . What ? I don 't ... Are you a journalist ? No , I 'm not a journalist . There 's something in the vaccine . What do you mean ? Is this ... ? Did you read about the massacre at Bainstow School ? Yeah . Grant . Oh , my God . He was set up . We 've got something for you . A sample of the vaccine . Come quick . Come quick . Michael ? Are you OK ? It 's fine , Jen , just ... Look , I need to sort something out . Well , can I see it ? It 's OK . Where did you get this ? It doesn 't matter . But that is it . Do you know what it does ? It sterilises people . 90 to 95 % of the people who receive the Russian flu vaccine ... .. will become sterile . Look , can you help us ? There was a woman , Milner , MI5 . She said you 'd help . I mean , are you sure ? They 're everywhere ! They kill people , we 've seen them . They killed her mother . There 's a man . A scientist . He 's not a good man , but he , he knows people . Stay here . I need to make a call . Are you hungry ? Do you want some food ? No . Thank you . We 're fine . Do you think we can trust him ? Don 't reckon we should hang around . I 'm going to get him a sample to him . I can make a trade . He 'll put us onto someone who can help . You serious ? I mean it . Do you need somewhere to stay ? No , we have friends we need to get back to . How do I get in touch with you ? Do you have a phone ? We don 't trust phones . OK . Come back here tomorrow . Same time . OK . Come on . Stay where you are ! Move ! Come on ! Down ! Get off me ! I need ... water . What did you tell them ? I ... Tell them ? I told them nothing ! I need water . They have the vaccine . Yes , but they don 't know what it is . They 're just children . They know nothing . They know exactly what it is because you told them . No , I ... I said nothing . I ... Enough of this . Finish him . He 's served his purpose . He made good cover . Now he 's a liability . It 's time to end this . You want me to ... ? Well , I 'm not going to do it myself , am I ? Everything 's been arranged . His medical records now show a history of depression . We 've men ready to take his body to hang from a bridge in Richmond . We have a coroner there . No , I don 't think I can ... Yes , of course you can . You see , it 's an order . I 'm giving you an order .

She has the glands beginning to swell . That 's the first sign . I 'm also noticing a rapid pulse and she is beginning to feel a little bit feverish . We have to wait about a day . - Please , Dr. Felps , please , if we 've got to do something , it has to be done . I have all the gold in the world , you know my husband is the wealthiest in the town . - This disease cannot be controlled by wealth .

He dismissed all of them . That has not happened , and he even told me to go home and stay with my family . - It 's horrible . All these children turning up sick . - What do you think ? It 's some kind of a plague ? - I don 't know . Mrs. Molly told me her son was struck ill just last week and he can 't get out of bed . - Why isn 't Pastor Miner worried ? - How do we know he 's not worried ? - What do you think we should do ? - I don 't know , but I don 't want him outdoors and I don 't want him around all the other children . - Hopefully , it 's just a passing thing , not the plague .

There 's no ... no treatment right now , on these conditions . You can have pustules , sores , lesions , it degrades into fever , and also aches and pains . They die within three days . We 've got to find a way ... - Thomas ! Thomas ! Thomas ? Oh , my God ! Thomas , wake up ! Wake up , Thomas ! Thomas ! Oh , Thomas ! - The news I have isn 't good . I have examined Thomas three times , he has it . I ... I don 't know how to tell you this .

We 're going to try to keep him pain free . But ... - He has it ! Not my son ! Why ? Why ? God , why ? - May the angels of God drive this child through the gates of heaven .

Let 's see , I have you here . Ah , born in 1851 in a small town of Nuisance , Pennsylvania . How are you ? - Good . - Well , let 's see . It says here that you enjoy horseback riding , playing ball with your brother , and reading . You 're a reader . - Uh-huh . - Wonderful . - Uh ... where am I ? - Well , Jiseel , you are in the library . And just like all the other boys and girls waiting on line , this is a magical place . A place where you can come to the library , pick any story in the book , and become that character . - But ... I wanna go home . - Well , yes , I know . But you can 't go home , Jiseel . Once you 've passed , you come to the library and you get ready for your new life . Choose a story in the book and ... and we send you there . You see , you do remember being ill , right ? Remember being ill ? - Yes , the doctor came to see me . - Alright , the doctors came and saw you and you 've passed on and we 're getting ready to give you another life in another part in the world , and this is why you come to the library . You pick a story . You can be anyone you want . You can go any place you want , and we send you there . I got it . I have a special place that I 'm going to send you . You are going to be a carnival announcer . In New York City . How about that ? You can say " Ladies and gentlemen , step right up , step right up . I am Jiseel , I am your carnival announcer , step right up . We have water that burns . Come see the one foot man , the nine-hundred pound woman , the bearded lady , and the human gorilla . " Perfect . You 'd be perfect for that . So how about ? Carnival announcer it is ? Now , what area in the world would you like to go into ? You 've ready many books , what fascinates you ? - I 've read a book about China and I really want to go there . - China ? China ... very interesting people , culture , food ... what would you like to do in China ? - Uh ... I want to be a teacher . - A teacher in China ? Well , China it is . I 'm gonna go get the China book , I 'll be back , and then we will launch you into your new life . Okay ? - Jiseel ... Jiseel ... - Mom ? Is that you ? - Come here . - Hey ... that little child that was here , did she warp ? - You didn 't see her leave ? - No . - Next ! - Parson ... my subject went through the portal when she wasn 't prepped . - How did that happen ? - I don 't know . I went up just to get a book real quick , for China , and I came back and she 's gone . But I feel it , that she wasn 't prepped when she went through the portal . I need to see The Relic . - No one sees The Relic . - Listen , tell The Relic that Orz would like to see him . - I have an old relationship with him . - Just make it happen . - Home . Home ! I think it was just a bad dream . Dad ! Dad ? Dad , it 's me . I 'm not sick anymore . Dad , Dad ! Dad ? Dad ? Oh , God . - Shh . I think you must leave now . - Hi . - Who are you ? And ... and why is my body here ? - Well , my name 's Jiseel . And ... well ... sadly , you died . - I 'm Thomas . - Hi . - Nice to meet you . Uh ... Is this a dream ? - It 's not a dream , but we have to go . - So , you 're saying this is the afterlife ? - Pretty much . - Is there any way I can inform my body ? - I 'm not so sure , but if you come with me to the library , maybe . - I 'll take that risk . - Okay , come on . - Who is that ? - I see my mom down there . Come here . Come play with me . - Just hold on tight , don 't let go . - Relic , I can still see you 're notorious at your places of meeting . - We have a problem . - I know what it is , but I can 't let you track the child . - She thought that she was hearing her mother 's voices . - How did this happen ? - Excuse me ? Ma 'am ? Excuse me ! Hello ? - You know they 're not allowed to head to the library . For that reason alone , they broke the truce . I should be allowed to at least go track the girl and bring her back . She has the book . Most likely they 're after her right now to get that book . If they get it , it will mean disastrous consequences for The Library , you know that . - Hello ? - Let me go ... and bring the girl back . - Fine . It 's my guess that the girl has already walked at least three times and it will be impossible to find her . Do not pass the three minute mark . And remember ... if you pass the six minute mark , not even I can bring you back . And bring two others with you , but guarantee me their safety back . - Guaranteed . - I wanted to bring you all here . We have a mission . It 's very important that you listen . The rules have changed . And though you are the best trackers , there 's been limit set on the game . The father has put a time limit on one that you are not allowed more than three minutes . Anything more than six minutes , you 'll be stuck there forever . - I don 't understand the three-minute mark . Why do we let the evil lurk ? - You 've been in a lie a little too long , my friend . The three minute mark ... is because there is a truce . We 're not supposed to be in that world . We are there for a mission . Our mission is to go and get the girl , bring her back safely with the book , and go back to the library . On your forearm will be a time code . The clock will start the moment you enter the next warp . It will warn you the closer you get to three minutes . But even after one second after three minutes of dome testing , they will come at you with everything they have . You will not be able to fight them off . If you 're there past six minutes , you 're done . Understood ? - Yes . - Okay , let 's bring back the girl safely . - Okay ? Good luck . - Honey , what 's the matter ? - I need to talk to you . - What ... what 's wrong ? - It 's happening again . - What 's happening again ? - The visions . - What visions ? - It 's a little girl that ... that 's nearby and she 's ... she 's asking for help . - We talked about this . - Listen ... she ... - You can 't help her . If ... if you do that , she 'll never go away . - She ... she ... she needs the help . - You ... you it can 't be done . You can 't do it . We 've already talked about this . We can 't go back to this . - And where ... where is she ? - She 's ... she 's ... she 's right behind you . Jules ? - Yes , papa ? - Come here , sweetheart . - Okay . Yes , papa ? - What happened to Mr. Ray 's daughter ? - She died of the fever . - Of the fever ? When did she die ? - Three days ago . - Three days ago ? Okay , thanks , sweetheart . - You 're welcome . - Listen , you 're not from this world no more . Don 't come back around here ; I can 't help you . Did you hear me ? I can 't help you . But go down to the graveyard , and there 's a nun there that can help you . Don 't come back around here no more . - I saw what you are looking for . - When did she leave ? - I saw what you are looking for . - When did she leave ? I 'll ask one last time . When did she leave ? - My pig ... my poor pig . Can you help me , please ? My pig ... can you help me ? Can you help me ? Please , help me . Help me . Help me . Can you help me ? My pig ... - What are you doing here ? Why are you here ? What are you looking for ? What are you trying to find ? - I expel the evilness out of you . - Collins ? Collins , is that you ? - Amy ... it 's me . - But why haven 't you gone to visit me all this time ? - Amy , I 've done some terrible things . Very bad things . I 'm not ready to come back . - Are you gonna stay ? - I can 't ... I can 't . - Yes , you can . - What is this place ? - I think I recognize it . Might be my Aunt Bay house . Aunt Bay ? Aunt Bay ? Aunt Bay ! - Don 't worry about it . Let 's get going . - Okay . - What are we gonna do now ? - I don 't know . Help , help ! - Help ! - Help ! - Children , children , we must go . Leave everything right there . We must leave now . Let 's go . Come on . Come on . Shh ... shh ... - No ... - Come on , then , afterwards you must let me be . Why do you haunt me ? - We can be together again . - How , Mary , how ? - He 's taken your wife . - Never ! - She 's not here . - You 're not gonna find her . - She 's gone . - We 're lost . - Come on in , don 't be scared . I can help you go back to the library . - Well , how can we trust you after all we 've been through ? - Come closer . I 'll tell you . - Oh my god ! God ! - I 'm not waiting ! - Why are you here ? What are you looking for ? The war has been over for centuries . I 'm gonna bleed you . I 'm gonna bleed you just like in the days of old . Then I am going to feed your bones to my ghouls . Little cuts here and there . That 's good . I have some better tools . I want you to give me the answers . Tell me , what do you hear ? Why are you here ? - You disobeyed the six-minute warning , my son . - Where is he ? - I don 't know . - Don 't know ? - Don 't know ? - He brought us back ! - That 's impossible ! - Nobody can defy the six minutes and bring you back . I want him back . - I tried to bring him back . I ... want ... . him ... back . - I tried to bring him back , he doesn 't want to come back . - Unacceptable . I want him back . Unless ... unless ... that 's impossible . - Hello . - Hi ... um ... we 're lost . I don 't think we belong her . - Nonsense , child . It just takes some time to get used to . You 're cursed , child . I can show you the way . You 're cursed , child . I can show you the way . Things are a bit different here . They put me in here because I said I didn 't love the children . I didn 't care . Fools ! I gave the children their freedom . They were trapped in a world that was infected by the sickness and greed . - Thomas and I were in the house and he touched the book . - Child ... you 've come to me . I can protect you . Don 't be afraid . The book can take you to places . See death from a whole nother perspective ! Be there at the hour . just like the time will pass . ? Give me the book ! Child ! I said give me the book ! - That 's my mother ! Mom ? What 's the matter with you ? No , no ... what 's the matter with you ? It 's not your mom ! - What 's the matter with you ? - I 'm telling you it 's not your mom ! No ! - Mom , it 's me . - Your tricks won 't work on me . - I 'm your mommy . I 'm your mommy . - We had a conflict several millenniums ago . You kept the balance of the darkness and I watched over and watched you tip it . You broke the sacred order . The fire at the mountain of Cathair , the parting of the earth in Rafinia , and the prestulous of a small village that ravaged the community of Philadelphia . - ( chanting ) Get the book ! Get the book ! Get the book ! Get the book ! Get the book ! - And the people , in fear , turn not to me , but to you . A false messiah . They had questions . They wanted answers . So I descended here to restore the balance and to banish you . For you all no longer hold the reigns of darkness . I put the girl in this journey , with the book , in the Library , through the door , to walk through the fires of death to find you hiding . Greet your due and languish in it for eternity . - Well , Jiseel , you 've had quite the journey . Can I have the book back ? Thank you . - Do you know where Thomas is ? - I 've returned Thomas to his original place . With his mother , where they are going to live a long and happy life . And you ... you 've been keeping me very busy trying to find you . Now that I 've found you , no more travels with the book . Take my hand , there 's one more journey to go . And count backwards to five . Ready ? Here we go . - Five ... Four ... No one ever spoke about the plague that whipped throughout our town . They believed if the people were silent , it would never return . Sometimes , when I lay in bed at night , it starts to hit me . I begin to ask myself over and over if this was all a dream . I was lucky . Given a second chance . The doctor says I miraculously recovered . Then , sometimes , I am always crookedly reminded . It was a reality . The end Subtitles by Renatinha Tankinha

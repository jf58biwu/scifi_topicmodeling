 Hi . It 's Tobbe . How would you recognize David Eischers code ? With it you can change the world . - Do you understand what the code does ? - Yeah ... It made you . It is the key of David . Take care of it . - God created man . - Who created Hubots then ? The devil ? Call her . She 's your mom . I 'll think about it . - Can I borrow money from you ? - Of course . How much do you need ? How did you get that ? Where is Therese ? Turn it off . Who 's in charge of the detention center ? Roger ... It 's just that his brain missing . Who would do something like this ? Niska . - I do not have the code ... - No , then why call .. But I have David 's brain . - Who are you ? - Beware of Roger . - Roger ? - Behind you ! In front of you ! Behind you ! Stop ! Stop . Stand still . Stand very ... . very ... still . - Why should I ? - To lure Roger . I think we will be invaded . - Is there a map of Hub Battle Land ? - Something like the guests get ? We do not call them guests . They are Intruders . - All like Roger are intruders . - Welcome to the Hub Battle Land ! Turn around . No one has been here . Do you understand ? No one has been here . Real Humans Season 2 - There 's my car . - Do not worry if it takes a long time . - It will go fast . I promise . - Have fun ! Sit down . Do not move . You can go now . Go . - Go ... Go - GO ! You buy us . You own us . But it 's not what you think . Actually , we own you . It is you we are watching . It is you who are similar to us . It is us that are real and it is you which are the fake people . That 's the second time the fuse blew . We require up to 32 amps . - Amperes ... - But I 'll fix that . - Say amps again ! - Check out what we can disconnect . - Today , gladly . Now , maybe ? - Wait ... I think it has come off . - Lights on ? - Yes , but there is no danger . This may be our morning routine . - Is it even ? - Yes . So ... Hey , I 've been thinking . I 've been thinking . The adoption . I have thought a little more on it . If this is something you really want , then I want it too . Really ? It 's all I ever wanted . That 's great ! There is a electrical conversion box that pulses the current . Pulse Width Modulation ? That would be great . Look at me ! Shall I tell you about my childhood ? - No , I just want to see you . - Okay . Today I 'll retrieve it so I can set you free - and free myself . And then ... We will unite you and me . I 'll be inside you and you 'll be me . And I 'll be you . - Very soon I 'll go home to mother ... - We have no mother . Well , I have a mother . Everyone has a mother . It may be that you do not want to hear about your mother . - I do not know anything about my mother . - Exactly . Today I have a mom , only because she has something that we need . But you 'll never have to meet her . I promise . I am a child of David . I 'll never die . I will rule . - When do we leave ? - Soon . Can you ready to go ? No , we 'll stay at home . - Maybe I 'll stay here with them . - You should get ready too ! - Mimi , would you like to come along ? - I can 't , I need to defragment today . My system is asking for an updated protocol . Okay ? I must be turned off tonight . And then restarted later . So maybe one of you can start me again after dinner ... It 's good that she takes care of herself . Here we go . She has already turned off , so we may as well do it later . It just feels so wrong ... like some ... Eh , Tobbe , Betty will be here anytime now . Have you told her ? ! How else can we find out if it 's the right code ? What do you know about programming ? Tobbe , don 't you know how big this is ? Mimi might be the only liberated Hubot so I know you to like her the most . Think of how it would help her if there were more that were like her . How it will help all Hubots ! OK , we can find out if it 's the right code . But I want us to decide what to do with it . Promise me that ! Yes , I promise . I promise , Tobbe . Thank you ! What the hell ... Come on , then ! Hello ! It 's okay , I have not tinkered with him . - Is Kevin at home ? - No , he 's camping . Can I come in ? - I don 't know if that 's ... - Please ? Sure . - Hello ! ... Liam . - Hello . It 's the same . Nothing 's changed . - I met Kevin . - Yes . Should I wash up , Roger ? Why sure ... I 'm relieved that he had second thoughts about the Real Youth . Yeah . This is why Liam and I are moving . - I see . - Abroad . Some countries have a little more liberal rules when it comes Hubots . - Where ? - The Netherlands . - Have you told Kevin about it ? - Yes , I 've talked to him . Maybe he wants to come along . Did he say that ? I 've suddenly got a new job , so we 're moving in a few days . - A few days ? - From now ? - All finished . - Do you want me to vacuum , Roger ? - No Liam , we have to go . I have tried to get hold of him , but he does not answer . Is there something with his phone ? He is in camp with the Real Youth . - But he said ... - He 's almost an adult . What should I say ? It does not matter what I say . - Liam , we 'll go get Kevin . - Stop ! You can 't do that . - I 'll do whatever the hell I want ! - Therese ! That will be perfect ! Good morning , Kevin ! Are you awake ? Thank you so much . Put it here . Oh very good , you think like me , I like that . Now it is not much further . Take a left at the next intersection . The election campaign is starting soon . People out there are curious about Hubots . They are worried . Will other parties talk about the Hubot program ? No , never , never . This leaves cracks to open up . What can you put in a crack ? - What do you put in a crack ? - A wedge . We will use this to bring up the Hubot program and make it a political issue . If you put a wedge in a crack it splits the thing in two . Sooo , does anyone have a wedge ? Hubot virus . Good ! But we will call it a Hubot Trojan Virus which is the real name of the virus . We 'll play a mind game . I am a member of another party at the plaza meeting . I 'm talking about welfare , taxes care ... bla bla bla . Stop me anytime ... I would not feel safe if a Hubot took care of me when I was sick . Do you have a plan of action if a Hubot at a nuclear power plant becomes infected ? Hubots are prohibited at nuclear power plants . Why ? Is it because they are dangerous ? - Robots are always safe . - But not at nuclear power plants ? They will say that Hubots within the government and care industry are virus protected . - Not the one who drove a bus into the ditch . - It was owned by a private company . Who cares , what 's the difference ... Now the debate has started ! We will drive as many wedges as possible . Divide up into two of you and we 'll see who comes out on top . - Kevin , are we ... ? - Two and two . Take pens . It looks exactly like what Einar has . But look here at the end ... See - A common code does not end like this . - Yes , I don 't know what that is . Try to add this there . I got that from Mimi . No . Nothing happens . - Einar may program a Hub with it . - No , that 's going too far from here .. - Can we try it on your Hub then , Mimi ? - Certainly not . - Seriously ! - No . - We can try on you . - Funny ... Tobbe , come on . - I 'm not letting it get away .. - We have to see if it works . If it works - what do we do ? - Then we know . What are you afraid of ? - We 've talked about it before . No one will do anything that we do not want . We need a Hub to test on . Einar 's is chopped up , so they will not work . - Suppose we were able to take ... Lennart . - Yes ! That 's our grandfather . It 's my Mom 's , what if he goes up in smoke . - He 's already toast . - Yes , if he 's already toasted ... - How is he toasted ? - He went buggy. and nuts on my Dad . Okay . And you 've tried a normal reboot ? Or ? Okay , we 'll test it . Tobbe , start it ! Perfect ! Listen now ... - Lennart . - Betty . Hey . We 'll take him with us and make a backup . What was you name ? We 'll try to do a reinstall of his system . Then we can be certain all the bugs are gone . - Okay ... - Matilda , relax . Never mind . Okay . - Lennart , you should come with us . - You can accompany yourself . Grandpa ... it 's OK . I see . I was a schoolmaster for 60 meters . Have I told you that ? Yes . Approximately 100 times . Come on ! This must be it . Here it is ! Turn left . Sen ... environment . Hubots use electricity . Batteries are harmful to the environment . - Good . Write it . - I 'll write environment . People are becoming obese . They move less when their dolls do everything for them . - Is that so ? - I don 't know . It doesn 't sound like an outrageous statement . Write obesity . Obesity . Think of something else . We know how it was before Hubots existed . How will it be in the future when we have children ? I do not mean when WE have children , but when people in the future do ... I want to have children someday . How should I say it ? And then maybe they 'll take over the world . Hey , time is running out ! - We will meet again . - I think Eva yelled . Do you think we will win this wedge contest ? We 'll win the Oscar either way . For those who claim that they are only cute dolls it is important to explain that there are some risks as well . Good ! Great . Who has not said anything ? Let 's see now ... Yeah , Rebecca and Kevin , do you have anything ? I will be back soon . - We talked about the environment . - Hello , hello ! And also the ... Battery Kevin , I gotta talk to you . Come with me . I am Kevin 's mom . I need to talk to my son now . - I need to talk with you . - Damn , she has a pacman with her ! This is a Hubot-free area . Remove the Hubot immediately . - He 's just waiting . - He ? Is it a living thing ? - Many fear Hobots . - He is totally harmless . - I want to talk to my son . - Enough . Remove your Hubot ! I 'm moving now , Kevin , as I said the other day . - If you want , you can come with . - I not coming ! - I never want to see you again . - You can 't mean that . Yes , I do . Stop that ... turn that off ! Kevin , If you want to talk to your mom , it 's perfectly alright . Sit down , honey ! Sit and drive . Go ! Quickly . That was not my Mom . She left my Dad for a Hubot . I 'm fucking not talking with her again . Hubots destroy our lives . They destroy thousands of people 's lives . As we sit here , they are destroying our lives . If we do not stop this ... We MUST put a stop to this . Bastard Hobots belong down on the ocean floor ! I was about to say that a Hubot ruined my life too . It shouldn 't have happened , so I joined Real Youth . Earth is for real people ! I have flowers for Douglas Jarméus . Call his father and ask where Douglas lives . His address , please . We shouldn 't get one of those . We 're getting a real baby . They have real children too . Douglas and Florentine ? We are the leading adoption agency . We cooperatate with Bambitronics Hubotchild programs . We want a real child . There are many poor and orphans . I see that you are newlyweds . You should really be married for two years . But if you can prove that you have had a longer relationship , that 's also good . I think this is a reasonable requirement . We 've been together a very long time . We are also well off . If that makes a difference . - You can not buy a child . - No , you can 't do that . I mean that money does matter . Of course , but we are looking for other things besides cash . - Of course . - Can we move on ? If I was forced to leave my child behind , I would choose a rich family . You sell good children ? Are those that are not good free ? - We do not sell children . - Of course not . Florentine means well . She is just extremely dedicated . Excuse me . You may come in with additional information , so we can look at it . Currently , it is a queue of at least 36 months for an adoption . - 3 years ? - This is the reality . For everyone . How can they let the children wait for years to have parents ? Sickening ! Everything takes such a long time . We can make this into something positive . We 'll get a few perfect years to ourselves . We can travel . We can do whatever we want . We can use this time . We 'll think about it and see what happens . You 're right . I 'll think about it . - I want to walk home and think . - You 'll have to walk several miles in the rain . I 've charged and I can find my way home . I was doing good alone before we met . Ummm ... okay . I went on to Technology and bonded firmly with another girl . - I met your grandmother 3 years later . - Lennart ... Ann Louise had a couple jobs and her own apartment . I lived there ... - We need to turn you off now . - ... before I got a job . - Grandpa ... - Maybe I should call Ann-Louise . Lennart , we need to turn you off now . What for ? - We have to suspend you . - I do not want that . - We have to do a backup . - No , I say . I will not be silenced . Don 't you hear what I 'm saying ? ! No ! Help ! Aaaa ! Little Grandpa ... Betty ! Yes . Thank you ! What 's going to happen exactly ? Exactly ... I have no idea . We 'll find out . - I do not know what you have here . - Ready ? - Yes . This is plain HTML . Then it 's some kind of equations . String Equations . There is no program you can run . - What do you do now ? - We need more processing power . More memory . On the memory stick there is limited space , a small amount . Okay ... Are there any good things here for us ? - Holy shit ! - What is it ? We have a break through ! Okay , here we go . - Does everyone understand how it works ? - Yes . You have 20 minutes for your game . Hit the surfaces that are breast , stomach and legs . You have chosen a fair game , so a hit to any women with children subtracts points . Any questions ? Get ready . Good luck ! Four , three , two , one ... Game begins ! This way ! And on Saturday we close at 22 : 00 . You 're welcome . Last week was the best so far . We have exceeded the target by 20 percent ! Good , Odi ! - Didn 't you have a guy ? - Yea Joe . Bring him and his buddies and let them try . - Hello , Jonas . - I will be away for the rest of the day . We have exceeded sales targets by 20 percent ! - I 'll tell him later . This way ! - So we must not do that . - Says who ? Says Roger . This makes us invincible .. All Rogers have invaded our Hub Battle Land . We will defeat them . We will not fall . We will fight until they all disappear . Shhhhh ! This way . Release me . Release me ! Bea ... is that what you are called ? I think we can help each other . Maybe you can help me . I 'm in charge and you do what I say . Otherwise , it 's good night . You 're just a robot , even with the advanced software you have . I kept the brain after David died . It felt better than to leave it , with the what it contained . But you were trying to steal it . What is this all about ? I want to see my husband again , David . The brain will do a lot for your son too - Jonas . We can both get what we dream of . You do not dream of anything . Is that clear ? You know nothing about that . Davids memory device may be in the brain that you have , But without David 's body it is useless . It must be connected to the skull . - It 's won 't be easy to get it out of the grave . - It 's not there anymore . But I can show your son where to find the clone if you let me . I 'm not doing anything before he gets here . And you ... You can probably save your batteries . - They just disappeared . - I think they 're out there . No , we tried to look for them and can 't find them . One of them has a real weapon . A real weapon ? I do not know what kind . Ahh , okay , you get your money back . If one is not used to seeing real weapons , these look real . Thanks . You 're welcome to come back again ! - Roger ? Roger ? - Here I am . Look , this last gang did not spot any Hubots out there . One of the cameras recorded it , if we have lost touch with the Hubs . - Bring them in , we 'll check them out . - But where are they now ? Roger , Silas was wondering if you have looked in the tall building ? On top . Relocate . Roger is coming . I found this . What the hell ? The gun is gone . - Do you have a gun ? ! - No one has been in here . Who has been here , Odi ? - " No One " ... He 's the new one . - The new ? - Hubot ? - Yes . - Hell ... - He doesn 't ... of course . Calm . Damn , that 's cool . Okay , we 'll do this : We 'll close for today , we 'll fix it tomorrow . Okay ? It 's cool . It 's okay , Roger ! Cleaning ? Good evening ! There .. He 's rebooting now . - Shit ! - Do not touch him now ! Do something , then ! Ann-Louise ! ANN-LOUISE ! FRY IN HELL ! Who am I ? Lennart ! LENNART ! Tobbe , run after him ! Shit ... - Lennart ? - Einar , will you come here ? Look ! Come on ! I screwed up . One can not load them with this program as usual . This is much more of a complex program , a virtual mass . If you pour in all at once , it becomes an ' overdose ' . - I have to try on more Hubots . - I can take it and give it back . - " I can take it " ? - Yeah , it 's theirs . Where is it safest to hide it , if not here ? Okay . Stand still ! Hold still Do not move . No ! What should we do ? Don 't worry . We can pick him up from Hub Sec tomorrow . - Or ... whoever owns him can . - It will have to be Mom , then . - Tobbe ? - I have to get the code . Tobbe ! What the hell ... - Where is he ? - I told him . But Tobbe , it 's cool ! He has it locked up . Nothing can happen , right ? You coming ... ? What place would be safer ? - Hello ... - I drove the wrong way . Jonas ... sit down . Why are they here ? Burglary . They were after the same thing as you . Where is it - the brain ? - In the ... It 's not hurt ? - Know what you are getting yourself into ? - Yes . - Are you sure ? I know what I 'm doing , Mom . I 'll get them later . Unfortunately I have a lot to do ... - But Jonas ... - Get off me ! You have to have all the parts from David 's clone . Otherwise the brain will not work . How do you know ? Who told you ? I had a conversation with ... that one there . - Where 's the body ? - She has hidden it . Do you know where it comes from ? It is a clone of David 's wife . David Eischer 's . As it stands at his company . - Do you know what that means ? - The fact that I own it . Exactly . He retained the serial number ... as a last leash . Do you know what the MSU code is ? Get a pen and paper . With it you can lock and unlock their operating systems . You can reset it to as it was when it left the factory . We do not want to do that , but however , we want to activate the immobilizer . Do you have a electronic identification pass , or is it too modern for you ? - No , I have one like that . - Call Hubtronic . Request the MSU code on that drive . Hi , I would like to have an MSU code for a Hubot unit . Yes , I 'll wait . Arrested ... ? Where is he now ? He was taken by Hub Sec . What ? ! - He was running wild . - You knew that he was broken ! - Sorry ! What should I say ? - It was stupid . - Yes , it was . You have not done anything else with him have you ? Tobbe ? What ? No . We can pick him up tomorrow and do a restore . - I 'll get him now . - Honey ! We 'll do it tomorrow . Hello , Tobbe . Is everything all right ? Everything 's good . I 'm just tired . I must sleep ... Be careful of the neck . And support his head . Is not it beautiful ? Hub Battle Land . One day you 'll grow up and defend our Battle Land . Rick , I want to go back . - You stay here . - Be careful I 'll go and look for electricity . Stay here . Here ... Mother ... Bea ? I have activated your immobilizer . You go to sleep in 12 hours if my Mom doesn 't deactivate the immobilizer with a finger reader . Get up ! Show me where David 's clone is . Go ! Linking the brain to the clone requires advanced equipment . I have what it takes to release my clone . Why should I trust you ? OK ... I have Hubots that we can test on and I have a safe place . I have quantum computers and I know how to do it . - So we have a deal ? - And you will set me free then ? What happens next completely depends on how well you work with me . Your 12 hours is expiring ... . tic-tock . Do we have a deal ? And Clouette ? She will remain here ... for now . Stop ! Sit down ! Clouette has keys to the place where we hid the body . - If you 'd rather go ... - No ... . you go . I 'll be fast . Do you have a piece of paper ? Thank you .

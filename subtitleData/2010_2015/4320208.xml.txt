 Previously on ' V ' ... Your father 's been lying to you . I don 't think he 's really your dad . They disguise their appearance by cloning human flesh . I want you to confirm that you see skull bone . John may started The Fifth Column . He was the first V to turn against Anna . This message will give The Fifth Column the confidence to come out . There 's something I need to talk to you about . I 'm not who you think I am . What do you want ? I don 't want to be ordinary . If you were ordinary , you wouldn 't be here . George Sutton died . We did not get any names . My army is to be born . ♪ Anna . How did you get in here ? Before I arrived on this planet , you read the news . Now you are the news . You can have everything , Chad . But first ... I need to know ... can I trust you ? Let go . Once again , we look to the future as delegates from around the world convene in Geneva today for the annual world progress forum . Now this high-level meeting of the minds brings together some of the world 's most powerful men and women to explore solutions for international problems outside of the political realm . But all eyes are on visitor high commander Anna , who has unexpectedly shown up , amidst opposition , hoping to present their advanced technology own as blue energy as a gift at today 's roundtable discussion in Geneva . Now invited guests include United Nations senior officials and an array of emerging leaders ... Ty , I got you bagels . Zabar 's . You 're up early . Well , I never went to sleep . Tyler , I know that you 're angry , but I need to talk to you . What your father told you isn 't true . All this time , I thought it was my fault that you two broke up , because of my stupid little bike accident . I didn 't know that you felt that way . If I had , I would have told you . Yeah , but you didn 't . Ty , there was never anyone else . There 's--Joe is your father . We are--we are a family . What else haven 't you told me , mom ? Nothing . There 's nothing else . Where are you going ? To the ship , where people are honest with me . Val . I saw the passports , the fake names . I don 't know who you are . Sweetheart , last night I was coming home to tell you the truth , about everything . Whose baby is this , Ryan ? Val , that is our baby . I saw the ultrasounds . I 'm only six weeks pregnant . This can 't be my baby . It 's too big . Sweetheart , just tell me where you are , okay ? I 'm coming to get you . What I have to tell you I have to tell you face-to-face . You had your chance . This is Val . Leave a message . Come on in . Anything ? No . She just called . She hung up before I could explain to her . I don 't know , Leah . She 's scared . If she goes to a regular O.B. or to--even to a hospital- - no , no . Any human doctor will see there 's something different about that baby . Yeah , but I 've called everybody . I 've called her mother , her friends . No one 's seen her . Well , then we 'd better find her , before it 's too late . What do we have ? Three victims- - Carl Bryant , Tom Maslon , Juan Solano . Solano and Bryant don 't have any priors , but Maslon was red-flagged on our terrorist " watch " list a few years ago for an arms dealing . Slashed carotids and windpipes so no one would hear . Picked ' em off one by one , really fast . The killer knew what he was doing . Mm-hmm . There 's a fourth guy . Witness outside saw somebody stumble out . Said he looked terrified , so he 's probably not our killer . All three of the vics share this mark . Recognize that mark , Evans ? No . Any idea what it means ? Check this out . From the looks of it , they were planning a terrorist attack against the visitors . My intel says they call themselves The Fifth Column . This must be one of their cells . The Fifth Column ? Anti-visitor terrorist group we 've been tracking . There 's been increased chatter since that rallying cry appeared on the bottom of the mother ship two nights ago . I could use your terrorism expertise , Evans . Kendrick wants us to investigate The Fifth Column . Prints came back on our missing guy- - Alex Caruso , High School computer science teacher . Apparently , he 's an amateur . Looks like you got your first lead . Find Caruso before the killer does . Get us to The Fifth Column . You were right about the " john may lives " message . The Fifth Column are coming out of hiding , as you expected they would . They 're being met with swift and exacting punishment . Good . I hope you slept well . We have a big day ahead of us . I 'm looking forward to it . I 've never covered this event before . Now you have a front row seat . You 'll get to see progress being made firsthand . From what I 've heard , this forum tends to be more about political posturing than progress . Perhaps . But I plan to change that . Erica . Ryan . Something 's happened . What is it ? My girlfriend is missing . She 's human and she 's pregnant . How is that even possible ? It wasn 't supposed to be . She doesn 't know the truth about who I really am or the V 's . I just thought , by lying to her , I could keep her safe somehow , but- - it 's cost you . I know . Every time I try to protect Tyler , it just pushes him closer and closer to the visitors . We won 't lose them . We can 't . Your girl 's got a baby lizard in her terrarium ? No . Hobbes . Ryan . Ryan . Ryan . Ryan . Okay . Not today , Hobbes . Ryan . Okay , bad joke . Let him go . Does anyone else know , Ryan ? Yeah , Georgie knew . That 's why he went up on the ship , to save me , so I wouldn 't lose my family to V 's , like he did . This morning , three members of a Fifth Column cell were murdered in Queens . Was this our fault ? The message we sent from the ship- - we told people to come out of hiding the other day . No , this is a war , padre , and they were soldiers . No , Hobbes , they were regular people , and , yeah , this could be our fault . We have to stop them . One of the killers took the hard drive out of one of the computers . There could be addresses and names of other Fifth Column on it . They 'll be sitting ducks . Yeah . This one guy got away- - Alex Caruso . He 'll know who to warn . Yeah . How do we find him ? Well , he didn 't go home . He didn 't go to work , but his father is at the River Heights Veterans Hospital . He 's dying of cancer . I figure Alex checked in with him . He won 't talk to the FBI . If he 's on his deathbed , maybe he 'll open up to a priest . You gonna be able to handle this ? Take care of Val . We got it . Go . First the V 's got Georgie . Now they kill these guys . We have to stop the killing . We need to find Alex Caruso . The next blood that spills is gonna be theirs . Here . It 's for you . I bet you don 't have those on your planet . Lisa . Before your mother left for Geneva , she asked me to finish administering the empathy tests . I 'm down to you . Whatever my mother wishes . You failed . There must be a mistake . It 's my assignment with Tyler . I 'm supposed to make him fall in love with me . It must have distorted the results . Joshua ... You 've known me my entire life . The test has to be wrong . Your mother 's directive was clear- - immolate anyone who fails . No exceptions . ♪ V 1x08 ♪ We Can 't Win original air date on April 20 , 2010 It 's nice to see you again , high commander . Likewise , Mr. Secretary-General . May I introduce Chad Decker ? I am familiar with Mr. Decker . Thanks to you , so is the entire world . It 's a pleasure to meet you , Mr. Secretary-General . Your presence is welcome here , of course , but I hope you understand that the privilege of making a presentation to this forum is for invited guests only . I was hoping you could stand by my side as I present blue energy , technology that could offer answers to some of your world 's most pressing concerns . Many here are very excited to see the gifts you have to present . Yet there are others who reasonably wish to observe certain protocol . You understand , of course . May I ask what camp you 're in , Mr. Chima ? I 'm sure the Secretary-General remains ... objective . Thank you for your understanding . You must have known there would be opposition . I welcome opposition . It can only strengthen one 's agenda . Agenda ? I thought this was a gift . Good afternoon , Mr. Caruso . " My flesh and my heart may fail , " but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever . " Psalms . God provides comfort during struggle ... But so does family . Is there ... someone I can call for you , Victor , that could bring you comfort ? No . 1st Ranger Battalion . Vietnam . Two tours in Iraq , army chaplain . I 'm not just a priest , Victor . And I 've learned to trust nobody . Come closer , father . Come closer . My son Alex ... He told me the truth about the visitors . Some of his friends told him about ... Fifth Column . He 's in trouble , isn 't he ? Victor , look at me . You can tell me . Where is he , Victor ? Can you help him , father ? You have my word . I will do everything in my power . Alex ? Alex Caruso ? Was anybody hit ? The guy 's a lousy shot . No wonder the V 's are winning . Wait . No , no . A-alex ! Alex ! Your father told us where to find you , Alex . My name 's Jack . I 'm a priest . W-we 're here to help . We 're Fifth Column . You--you can trust us . That boy 's got 30 seconds to get his wits about him . No , no . He 's just scared , Hobbes . Jack , stop ! Alex , don 't shoot . I know you 're scared . Erica , don 't be stupid . Yesterday , you were just a schoolteacher . Well , yesterday , I was just an FBI Agent and ... a mom . Well , because of the visitors , our worlds have turned upside down . We are here to help Alex , you gotta put the gun down . Alex , come out . Please . It 's okay . I promise . Erica . Okay . Hey , it 's okay . It 's okay . How do I know you 're not visitors ? If we were visitors , you 'd be dead by now . It 's okay . Just put the gun down , Alex . It 's okay . Come on . Come on . Hey , it 's okay . Look at me . It 's okay . The visitors killed all my friends . It wasn 't supposed to be like this . I know . Secretary-General ? A word ? It 's never just a word with journalists , Mr. Decker . Two minutes , off the record . Off the record from the press or from Anna ? I don 't work for Anna . But would you be here without her ? Give us a moment . You 're right . I am here because of Anna . I 've spent a lot of time covering her , and from what I 've seen , you 're the first person who 's openly opposed her . Why ? There are consequences for Anna 's so-called gifts . Take the healing centers . The financial drain on our health care industry is immeasurable . Thousands of jobs are being lost , and as for any technology she may offer- - it could put technology companies out of business ? You 're saying that the bottom line is more important than helping people . I 'm saying it 's the same thing . We have reports coming in with breaking news out of Timbal , where a massive monsoon struck this tiny island nation two hours ago . Destruction of the island 's power grid and transportation infrastructure has hampered international rescue efforts , as thousands are unaccounted for , many feared dead . Tragedy . No . An opportunity . What are world leaders doing about this crisis ? At the moment , they 're trying to coordinate a response . But it could take a full day to get help to the island . While they play politics , we 'll take action . Dispatch rescue shuttles to Timbal . Bring them blue energy . Tyler , what are you doing here ? You didn 't answer my calls . I needed to see you . Now is not a good time . What 's wrong ? Everything 's different , now that I know that my mom and dad lied to me . It 's like you 're the only person I can count on anymore . I don 't know . I just- - I really need to be away from home right now . Me , too . This is what I call getting away . Did you find Val ? I 'm still looking . I need you to put a trace on her cell phone for me . I know I 'm asking you to break the law , but I just ... Can you do that for me ? It 's getting to be a habit of mine lately . Yeah , I 'll do it . I 'll call you when I have something . Thanks . My friend , uh , Juan , uh , told me about The Fifth Column . We thought we could help . That--that message on the bottom of the ship gave us hope . Tell us what happened , Alex . We set up a meeting with other Fifth Column to get weapons , but instead , a V showed up . And now everyone 's dead . This meeting- - how 'd you set it ? There 's a Web site where we dump photos encoded with messages to Fifth Column . The V 's hacked your code . There was a hard drive stolen from the scene . Did it have names and addresses of other Fifth Column in your group ? Yeah , there was a list of contacts , Fifth Column we could reach out to if we got in trouble . The V has that hard drive . He 's going to pick them off one by one , unless we stop him . There 's only one surefire way to do that before he kills anyone else . We bring him to us . How ? Use him as bait . What ? N-no . No . Use their Web site to send out an S.O.S. The V will intercept the message and come calling . And then we kill him . There are 29 ships hovering over our heads , and we don 't know why . If we do this , we take the V alive , finally get some answers . I told his father I would keep him safe . It 's up to you , Alex . You 've lost friends . So have we . But if we don 't stop them , more people are going to die . Lisa failed the test . Her death would be a great victory for us . Or a great loss . What if she is turning ? What if her feelings for Tyler are real ? If they are , she could be a great asset for us against Anna . And if you 're wrong , we lose the chance to destroy an enemy . I 've known Lisa her whole life . She seems human . She 's--she 's changing . She 's changing , like we did . How do you know you 're not being manipulated ? What if this is a trap to test where your loyalty lies ? We can never trust her . Anna 's right . I need to start my own life . What are you talking about ? I 've been thinkin ' . What if I join " live aboard , " live up here ? Look , I know it 's a big step . But ever since I was a kid , I always knew that something amazing would happen to me . Like the chance to live on a spaceship ? No . I 'm talking about you . ♪ a falling star ♪ ♪ fell from your heart ♪ ♪ and landed in my eyes ♪ ♪ I screamed aloud ♪ ♪ as it tore through them ♪ ♪ and now it 's left me blind ♪ ♪ the stars , the moon ♪ ♪ they have all been blown out ♪ ♪ you left me in the dark ♪ ♪ the stars , the moon ♪ Are you ... Okay with this ? No . ♪ You left me in the dark ♪ ♪ ooh , ooh , ooh ♪ ♪ ooh , ooh , ooh ♪ Any word on the phone trace ? Not yet . No word from Val ? No . I 've been looking everywhere . Okay . I figured I 'd check in on you , see if I can do something right today . We 're using the teacher as bait to lure out the V. Any idea how he 'll operate ? Yeah , he 'll want to make his moves up close . Knives , no guns . All your tech , you don 't have guns ? You shoot one of our weapons through a guy , people are gonna start asking questions . Blades are simple , untraceable and effective . That 's what he 'll use . It 's how I did it . Hey . Evans . What 's the latest on Caruso ? N.Y.P.D. reported shots fired on the rooftop of his dad 's midtown apartment . I checked it out . Nothing . Well , you better find him quick . There 's more . So .. Why 'd you guys join Fifth Column ? We had to- - Erica to protect her son , me to protect my congregation , my faith . What about you ? My father fought in Vietnam . My grandpa , world war ii . I wanted to make a difference like they did . You are . My dad warned me I wasn 't cut out for this . He was right . No , stick to the plan , Alex , and everything 's gonna be okay . Just stick to the plan . ( Snaps cell phone shut what ? Uh , there have been six more murders- - Lndon , Tokyo , Los Angeles and Sidney- - all Fifth Column . This incredible intervention in Timbal is being called a miracle , with Anna being hailed as savior . Thanks to high commander Anna 's gift of blue energy , Timbal 's power grids and infrastructure have been restored . Hospitals are back up and running , and V shuttles continue to land with emergency supplies . As a result , leaders here at the world progress forum have made a stunning reversal of their decision from earlier this morning to refuse Anna 's presentation . I made a promise when I arrived- - to share our technology and to leave your planet better than we found it . Clean , sustainable energy- - no pollution , no infrastructure needed , just power , the same power that runs our ships . Blue energy is the answer to your world 's most pressing concerns . And to the people of Timbal , it was an answer to crisis . Our needs are simple , and our desire to help is great . Mr. Chima ? You care to comment on what Anna 's done ? The high commander has done an amazing and selfless thing . She should be commended . It 's obvious we have a lot to learn from you . Secretary-General ? Any further comment on today 's events ? Off the record , of course . Anna came here under the guise of diplomacy , but played politics with tragedy . She used the people of Timbal to gain public and political clout . The question is , if they 're just visitors , why does she need that clout ? The V will be at the meet in less than an hour . Let 's go over the plan one more time . The codes are embedded in the photos , anything where there 's five - - five fingers , five dogs . Could be anything . It should only be us at t he meet and the V. After hours , no security , no guards . Dance floor 's all ours . You 'll have my sweet voice in your ear the whole time , kid . You 're gonna be okay , Alex . Sorry , padre . Ran out of Holy water . Alex , Jack will drop you in the center here , and then he 'll duck out behind the concession stand . I 'll post up half a click South . We will be with you the whole time . Hobbes will tell us all when the V arrives . He 'll come right up to you . Before he does , we get the drop . We take the visitor alive , he comes home with us , and we get answers . We good ? Yeah , we 're good . Ryan . I got a trace on Val 's cell . Where is she ? Welcome to the visitor healing center . A doctor will be here shortly to look at your baby . Everything will be just fine . Lisa . Your mother 's shuttle will be arriving from Geneva shortly . She 's asked to see you when she arrives . You have to go . Okay . I 'll see you tomorrow ? Good-bye , Tyler . Bye . Let me know when my mother arrives . Nothing yet . Deep breaths , Alex . Listen to them , Alex , and we 're all gonna walk out of here alive . Okay . Bingo . I see you . Alex , listen to me very carefully , okay , kid ? Change of plans . Ryan was wrong . The guy has got a gun . The V 's not coming to us . He 's already here , in sniper position . Now don 't panic . Stay right where you are . Now ? He 's--he 's in position now ? Alex , listen to Hobbes . Don 't move . Alex , freeze . Where is he ? He doesn 't have a clean shot , Alex . I can walk you out of there . Now listen to me . Do what I say . Take one step to your right . That 's it . And another . Now right . I can see him ! He 's gonna kill me ! Alex , don 't move . Just do what I tell you . Okay ? Now I need you to step right . Now hang on . Alex , I know that you 're scared . You are not in the line of fire . Just listen to ' em . Listen to ' em . Alex , don 't move . Just do what I tell you , okay ? Alex , wait ! No ! No . No , no , no , no , no . Ugh . Where is he ? 100 yards north , white building , second floor . I 'll cover you . Okay . No , no , no . Alex . Alex , look at me . Everything 's okay . No , no . No , no , no , no , no . No , look at me . Status . Sniper 's on the move . We gotta get this guy , Hobbes . If I move , he spots me . If he spots me , father Jack down there 's a sitting duck . You gotta get behind that building and take him . No , no , no , Alex . Alex . Look at me . Look at me . Stay with me . Stay with me , okay ? Don 't--no , no , no , no , no , no . No ! No . This is the lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world . Have mercy on us . Aah ! Don 't move . Stay still ! Aah ! You okay ? Are you ? No . Get in the van . Get out of here . I gotta call this in . Ow . Oh , my God . What ? He 's not a visitor . He 's human . I 've asked a lot of you with Tyler . You 've handled it well . The future of our species depends on your leadership , your judgment . This soldier 's egg is weak ... But it can still teach us something . Our cause , our survival , outweighs any sacrifice . There is no room for human emotion , for weakness of any kind . Joshua said you passed the empathy test . I never doubted you . You 're the world 's savior tonight . You took a tragedy and used it to your own advantage today . It 's why you invited me to the forum . You knew they wouldn 't let you present your technology . But what would have happened if there hadn 't been a monsoon in Timbal ? Then Myanmar , Darfur , Sri Lanka . There is tragedy every day all over your world . So many opportunities to help . They think you 're a God . Who does that make you ? A believer . Can I tell you what I believe ? You 're not just visitors . You 're here to stay . But are you here for our benefit or yours ? I didn 't do this for me . I did it for that little girl . If you can do that kind of good , I want to be part of it . I want to help . I need people I can trust and who trust me . Do you trust me , Chad ? Joshua . Why ? Because one day , I 'll ask a favor from you , and you 'll comply . This is just a vitamin shot to boost your immune system . Good for you and the baby . Thanks for seeing me so quickly . Let 's take a look at your baby . Mm . What is it ? Nothing too serious . I 'd like to see my baby . I-I need to see my child . You should sit . I think I should go . I 'm sorry , Dr. Stevens , but I can 't let you do that . Let 's go . Trust me . Why are we giving the humans blue energy ? Because once they 're dependent on it , we can turn it off . Alex was right . It wasn 't supposed to be like this . I 'll tell his father . I owe him that . Everything that we have done to fight the V 's , to protect people , and a human betrays us ? Well , maybe he can give us some insight into why . Rise and shine , sweetheart . You got questions to answer . What 's your name ? Oh , you 're not going anywhere . Talk . I can 't tell you anything . Why did you do it ? Tell me why . Because we can 't win .

That must have been awesome ... – Yeah , well , he was , I guess . – What happened ? I don 't know . He didn 't die or anything .

" Sounds familiar . – It does sound familiar . – Very familiar . You want to see direct influence ? Andrew . – She 's wearing black today . – Hi . That 's direct influence . This is my theory , though , is that it 's like a muscle . Like , it 's elastic . If you stretch it too far , too quick , it 'll tear . That 's why I think we 're getting stronger , you know ... because we 're working it out , getting buff . Buff . How about this for a workout ? Holy shit ! That was awesome . Classy . Attractive .

Oh , snap ! – Like I said ... – You gotta pay for that now . – Like I said . See ? – Holy crap . Just pretend that there 's a barrier over your hand , right ? And then ... When things are gonna hit you , as long as you 're ready ... they will not hurt you because of the barrier . – That 's so sick . – That 's me right there . I need that . Steve , you have to try this , dude . – Give me your hand . – No , it 's cool ... When I was a kid though , I actually did want to be a police officer . – А сор ? No shit ? – Yeah . Yeah . You do know that you can 't smoke weed when you 're a cop , right , Matt ? Oh , no . Really ? I didn 't know . But , no , I just ... I really got into , like , altruism . What does that mean ? What does " altruism " mean , Matt ? It 's like wanting to make things better for everyone . Really ? This coming from the man who is always talking about how pointless life is . Yeah , I know , but this is what I 've been thinking about lately . Like , I 'm looking back , and I just think ... the way I used to think about things was probably a lot better , you know . So , what , you want to go out and start a charity or something ? That 's lame . Wait . Why is that lame ? I don 't know . Douche bag . I 'm not good at everything . I just do my best at everything .

How do you feel about that ? You hurt somebody ! – Shit . – We need rules , okay ? Rule number one : No using it on living things . Rule number two : You can 't use it when you 're angry . That 's it . Rule number three : I don 't think we should be using it in public ... or telling anybody about it . Look , you can 't just declare rules , okay ? – I will declare rules ... – You 're the one that said nothing matters . I will declare rules . If we 're gonna keep going ... and we 're getting stronger , we need rules . We need rules , right ? Matt 's right . We need rules . Andrew ! Answer the goddamn phone ! Andrew ! Matt , what did he say ? Are you still mad at me ? – No , I 'm not mad . – Well , you seem mad . I 'm not mad . I just ... I just think that we need to be more careful now , you know ? We can 't ...

Dude ! When did you start doing this ? – Since when ? – What , with the camera ? Yes , with the camera . I don 't know . It 's been a little while , I guess . I can 't do that . I can 't do stuff that requires finesse . I tried to type my name out yesterday , and I cracked my keyboard in half . No , dude . It 's really easy . You just think that you 're holding it . Mom 's , like , never home anymore . I mean , you saw how my dad is . He 's just quiet . Sits around . And it 's pointless to talk to him about it 'cause he 's got nothing to say . See , it 's different , 'cause you 've always had friends ... and people want to talk to you and be around you . I never had any of that . I mean , before this ... I barely even hung out with Matt , and he 's my cousin . We were close when we were little , but ... I don 't know . In high school , everything changed . Ever been to the Space Needle ? Yep . When I was , like , five . It 's for tourists . Well , I don 't know . I mean , I went ... I think I was , like , seven ... with my dad one time and ... I don 't know . It was actually a really good day . You remember that ? Yeah . Actually , I do . You know , I 've been meaning to ask you . Winter break is coming up . You should do the talent show with me . No way . Why not ? It 'd be good for you to get out there . – Meet some people , meet some girls . – Dude , I 'm just not ... – What ? – I 'm just really shy , okay ? And I don 't even have any talents , so ... What are you talking about , you don 't have ... You have talent . You 've got talent . Oh , dude , no way . You look handsome . Thanks , yes . Steve ... let me borrow some of his clothes to make me look cool or whatever . I 'm glad you 're spending so much time with your friends . Yeah . Yeah , me too . – Hey . – What ? How are you getting to school ? – I don 't know what you mean . – Don 't bullshit me , you idiot . Matt doesn 't come . He doesn 't drive up . You leave the house . Who the hell 's giving you rides to school ? – Matt . – All right . You know what ? You 're lying . You 're up to something , and you can 't hide it . You think you can just slink ? Sneak in , sneak around my house , smiling ? I 'm onto your shit . How do you even work this stupid thing ? And we 're in business . Boo ! – Hey . – Hi . What are you doing here ? I 'm filming for the talent show . Matt Garetty is filming for the talent show . – Yes , I am . – Wow . What is this , some kind of newfound school spirit ? How do you like it ?

I bet you 're good at it . – You just throw the ball into the cups ? – Yep . Yep . I actually could be good at that right now . – Yeah ? – Maybe . – Let 's find out . – No , no . – Come on ! – What ? Come on . Come on . Okay , I 'm coming . I 'm coming . There you are . Amazing . That 's what I 'm talking about . Yeah ! Hey , where is Andrew anyway ? Andrew 's upstairs with the girl with the pink hair . – What , like , they went together ? – That 's my boy . Of course they went together . What are you talking ' bout ? Hey , Andrew . I hope you 're seeing this . Congratulations , sir . I just wanted you to know , dude ... I was really worried about you before all this , you know ? But , dude , things are gonna get so much better for you now . I really , really feel that . And I want you to know I love you , you know ? I love you , man . It 's you and me . It 's Detmer and Garetty , extended family for life . – Sorry . Sorry . – No , man . Excuse yourself . Oh , man . When did I become the one who 's out here ... – Hey , Matt . – filming myself ? Oh , hey . Hey , Casey . So what are you filming ? It 's just a thing . It 's not like eye of the storm or anything . Hey , I wanted to ... I wanted to tell you ... I 've really been ... It 's been making me think a lot . I 've been kind of thinking about it in my ... No , I have . Like , in my life . I 've been thinking , if I applied myself , what I could do . I could really change the world . – I mean , it 's really been ... – You 're drunk . What ? Hey , Casey ? I 've basically been stalking you since , like , sophomore year . Sorry , use of the word " stalking . " I shouldn 't have said ... You want to get out of here ? – Yeah . – Yeah ? Yes . Yes , definitely . I have to drop off the camera first though . Okay , you guys are getting ready to witness history , all right ? I 'm like a proud dad right now because behind these doors ... Andrew Detmer becomes a man . He 's a little boy behind there . He 's scared . He 's like a butterfly , getting ready to emerge ... – Oh , God ! – from a cocoon or some shit like that . Disgusting weirdo ! – Wait . What happened ? – Okay ... – Is that ... – Out of my way now ! – Oh , man . – Monica , what happened ? Drew ! Drew ! It 's okay , man . Don 't worry about it . Look , it happens to the best of us , okay ? – Dude ! – You had a little too much to drink ... – You ... – Buddy . – The hell 's going on , dude ? – Why are you laughing ? Man . All over my jacket . – Stop . Stop laughing . – What are you talking about ? – It 's cool , man . – No , it 's not cool , Steve . Stop . – Stop what ? It 's cool , man . – Will you just get out of here ? – Get out ! What 's your problem ? – Drew , Drew ! – You think this is funny ? – No , I 'm not laughing ... Get out ! Dad ! Andrew ! Please ! I need my medicine . Mom 's in pain , all right ? She needs her pills ! Where are you ? Where are you ? Dad ! Hoarding a $ 500 camera while your mom dies in there ? I mean , how selfish can you be ? I went through your camera . What did you see ? Just you being a loser . You think that those people are your friends ? They 're not . You 're an embarrassment . You 're running around this town , spending my money . Look at me when I 'm talking to you ! I didn 't spend any of your money , Richard . 'Cause I don 't have a dime to spend . Every last cent ... Look at me ! – Every last cent goes to school for you ... – School ? – and medication for your mother . – I go to a public school ! – I can 't even pay for a goddamn ... – You don 't pay for public school , you idiot !

It happened . So we 're just gonna sneak into the bathroom ... and catch this moment for posterity . Oh , my God , Matt . Can we not do the camera thing right now , please ? What happened ? It just started out of nowhere . My head hurts really bad . That 's probably Steve calling your cell again . I 'll call him back later . I think it 's time to take ... – Matt ! Matt ! Come on ! – Wow . I did not expect this . Give me my ... Hey ! Hey , asshole ! What are you doing up here ? Just leave me alone , Steve ! You can 't be up here , dude . This isn 't safe .

Get away from me now ! Please ! Amazing grace How sweet the sound That saved a wretch like me I once ... / i ... who , by the power of God , are safeguarded in faith . Even though you do not see him now ... you rejoice with an indescribable and glorious joy ... as you attain the goal of your faith ... the salvation of your soul . What are you doing ? You filming graves ? – I don 't get it . – What do you care ? You haven 't been returning my calls . Why aren 't you returning my calls ? – I 've been busy . – No , you haven 't . Why aren 't you returning my calls ? I just don 't feel like talking . – Turn off the camera . – No . Andrew . Andrew , turn off the camera . Andrew ? How did he get struck by lightning ... during a storm with no recorded lightning strikes ? How ? And they found Steve out in the middle of a field . Why would Steve go out in the middle of a field during a lightning storm ? – I don 't know . – Why ? What ? I don 't know what happened , Matt ! I don 't believe you , okay ? I want you to turn off the camera and talk to me . – Why ? – I want to have a conversation with you . Don 't tell me what to do , Matt . You can 't tell me what to do ! Don 't ever tell ... – Give me ... Shut it off ! – Get off of me ! Are you joking right now ? Is this a joke to you ? What did you do , Andrew ? What did you do ? Who am I supposed to tell about this ? Who do I talk to ? Who do I talk to about this ? Why won 't you just tell me what happened , Andrew ? Please believe me , Steve . Please , it 's just I ... I don 't know what I did . I lost control ... and I 'm so sorry . This thing is just becoming a part of me now ... and I don 't ... I miss you , Steve . ... all the drills . Good . We 're all pretty good , right ? Get ready . Go ! You guys ? Do not hesitate . Did you hear who worked ? He was like ... Oh , Andrew ! Dry off ! Totally . Hey , Wayne ! Okay , so , see this one here ? This one I got really clean ... 'cause I did this little lasso thing around the root , you know ? But then these two ... These , I did not get as good . See how they 're broken ? I think it 's because I got them from the middle , you know , instead of the root . Sloppy . I 've been doing a lot of reading online ... about just , like , evolution and natural selection and how ... There 's this thing , right ? It is called the apex predator , right ? And basically what this is is the strongest animal in the ecosystem , right ? And as human beings ... we 're considered the apex predator ... but only because smaller animals can 't feed on us ... because of weapons and stuff , right ? The lion does not feel guilty when it kills a gazelle . Right ? You do not feel guilty when you squash a fly . And I think that means something . I just think that really means something . This one I got really clean 'cause I did this little , like , lasso thing . Andrew , what happened at school ? I need to go pick up my mom 's medication ! Oh , yeah ? You 're gonna break the rules again ? We 're too strong for that now ! If you did that , you know what I 'd have to do ! – You 'd have to what ? – You have to start thinking . – What would you have to do ? – There are consequences to what you do ! You could not do anything to me . – Stop that bullshit ! – Because I am stronger than you . – I 'm not gonna let you do it again ! – I am not going to break your stupid rules ! So just screw off and stay out of my life ! I can 't breathe . Thank you . – Karen Detmer . – Just one moment . We 're gonna need a next-day delivery . Co-pay on that is $ 750.83 . – Well , I don 't have all that . – Son , I told your dad , and I 'll tell you . You can pay up front , and we can order next-day delivery . – Other than that , I can 't help you . – Prick . I don 't give a shit . Do whatever you want . Hey . Hey ! – Give me all your money . – What ? Who is that ? Doesn 't matter who it is . Just give me all your money or else . Or else ? Shit , man . Shit , man . Is that Andrew ? It sounds kind of like Andrew under there . And you got Andrew 's broke-ass backpack on . – Oh , you got a gat ? – I got a gat too , bitch . Dude ! Dude ! Come on , come on , come on , come on ! Come on ! Come on , come on ! Hey ! Camera needs to stay on for our investigation . Jesus Christ . Can I have a moment alone with my son ? If he regains consciousness , notify the officer outside . Yeah , yeah . Your mother 's dead . She died last night while I was out looking for you . I came home ... and she was there in her bed . If I just could have been there for her . I was always there for her when you were out screwing around . And this one time ... this one time ... that she needed me , and you took me away ! I want you to apologize to me . I know you can hear me , so I want you to sit up right now ... and apologize to me . You selfish , selfish asshole ! This is your fault ! You ... Do you hear me ? Your mother is dead , and it is your fault ! Happy birthday ! Pound it ? Pound it ? Go and get a present . Go and get a present . Yeah . – Yes , the big one . – Oh , my God . Matt . Your nose .

 Previously on Fringe ... We have been looking for you and your friends . Who 's the little girl ? Who 's the little blonde girl ? If you are watching this , then you know that the Observers have invaded . I must have ambered it . I need a proper laser . Could you make one ? Don 't you wear a necklace ? We just need the silver for solder . Thank you . If you 've found this tape , you 've retrieved it from amber . Got it . You must recover each tape to retrieve all the parts of the plan . This plan can rid the world of the Observers . You are humanity 's only hope ! Nah , he don 't think nothing about it . It should only probably take a few hours . He don 't give me the money , he 's gonna know about it . I 'll tell you that . Appreciate the help . Ah , he 's got the kids and all , you know ? Greetings . Looking to barter ? No . Not tonight . " If you want to make God laugh , tell him your plan . " It 's been there for a while . Guess it hits a little close to home . Yeah . Man ... I had one of these when I was a kid . I 'll give you a good deal , man . Actually , what I 'm looking for is a - This is what you are looking for . Yup . That 's it . It will look good on her , the young , blonde woman . What is baseball ? Excuse me ? You were thinking of the Red Sox . What is baseball ? It 's a sport - or was anyway . How much ? What do you want to give I for that ? I am upsetting you . You do not like to be read . Who 's upset ? I got nothing to hide . What 's to be upset about ? That take care of it ? Blood clot , man . I haven 't seen one of these in years . You 're trying to confuse me . I don 't know what you 're talking about , pal . Who is the young , blonde woman ? You are protecting her . Are you sure ? Do you know what this is worth ? Yeah . Keep the change . My papers . What are you doing out so late ? We have our papers right there . Is this the only paperwork you have ? There is something wrong . Detain him . Freeze ! Stop right there ! Now ! He 's down there . The last time I went under , I got bit by a rat . He is a rat . Bite him back . Aah ! Is that a real gun ? Where am I ? You came out of that storm drain . There . You 're bleeding . Come to mama . How does this one look ? A little less warped than the others . Hopefully it 'll play better . It took hours . Walter , this is about as fast as we can go without too much heat damage . Fast as a snail . At this rate , we will save the world in another 21 years . I 'm gonna clean this up . And you know how old that will make me . I don 't even want to do that math . Peter , what happened ? It 's-it 's all right . It 's just superficial . I was trying to get gas for the wagon . I got read by an Observer . He pulled thoughts out of my head like cards out of a deck . What did he get from you ? He did get an image of you . But at this point you 're as much a fugitive as the rest of us , so , unless you can think of a reason why that would hurt us - Did he give any indication that he pulled anything else ? No . I did what I 'm supposed to do , keep a bunch of random thoughts in my head , but then he knew I was doing that too , so I just got out of there . These guys , they out-move us , they out-think us . They 're always two steps ahead . More , if they focus . I don 't know how we 're gonna beat ' em . We beat them one by one . Instinctively , you did the right thing . You just have to create a labyrinth of planned thoughts , keep them preoccupied . Yeah . Trying to block that reading was exhausting . I couldn 't do it . It 's impossible . It 's not impossible . I 've taught others . It just takes a really long time . Well , teach me . I plan on it . I 'm teaching you all . In the meantime , I want you to consider this a down payment on my first lesson . You had to give up your necklace so we could work on the laser . I wanted to make sure you got a new one . Thank you . Worth every bump and bruise , kiddo . Well , you know the expression . No good deed goes unpunished . Living proof . You wanted to see me ? You do not like to be read . Who 's upset ? What 's there to be upset about ? I got nothing to hide . This is what he purchased - an alloy of gold and other metals , minerals , argentite , and chlorargyrite . What is its purpose ? Its purpose ? You wear it . You put it around your neck . He is a fugitive . Why put oneself at risk in this quadrant for something so unexceptional ? These fugitives are confident enough to walk freely . I think they receive information . The resistance is protecting them . You mean they 're being tipped off ? To our movements , yes . Two days ago , one of the men in your division failed a security test . I believe he is with the resistance . I think you will be able to get information about the fugitives through him . Why didn 't you tell me about the security fail ? I could ask you the same question . I didn 't know about it . That is my point . I 'll look into it . Welcome to tape two of my plan to defeat the Observers . Before we begin , first and foremost , you must accept the reversibility of all phenomena ... Particles have their speeds reversed , then the changes - found a measurable effect . Let me be crystal clear - understanding of these scientific concepts , we will not be fighting in the same field . These are the plans that we must follow to the letter - imperative that these plans be retrieved . Astrid , it 's impossible to tell what he 's talking about . This is as clear as I can get it . I have hidden them as I would my most prized possession . Funny story actually . When I was a boy , my mother would take me on what she called Manhattan mystery tours . We would catch the first train that came to the station , and then we would venture into the city ... And get off at the first - I 'll never forget - inspirational . The tape is ripped . It got caught on a fleck of amber . I 've heard enough . I know where the tube is . - You do ? - Mm . The subway platform beneath Newark Penn Station in the wall . How do you know that ? Because , as a boy , my most prized possession was my collection of detective comics . And , like everyone , I was terrified that the pinkos would attack . So I thought that a subway platform would be the safest place to hide them . Because it was underground . I was ten . And that 's where you hid the plans ? Yes . Under Newark Penn Station ? I am sure of it . Every major access point to Manhattan has an Observer checkpoint . That includes train stations . Okay , we have to take out the guards . Are they Observers or Loyalists ? Both . I don 't even know if we can get close enough to effectively take them out without being detected . Well , we need to create a diversion . I think we 're gonna need a lot more than a diversion . Peter . I 'm going to want to get to that rolling cabinet in the amber . Walter , there 's nothing in there except lab equipment and your Easy-Bake oven . I 'm not after what 's in it . It 's what 's under it . Astrif ... prepare the laser . Walter , why won 't you tell us what 's down there ? Because I 'm not sure that what 's down there is worth talking about . I 'm not sure what 's left . Here . Use some of this . All of you . It 's mentholatum . Not as bad as I thought . Walter , is this what I think this is ? My cold storage of all the Fringe events we ever encountered , dormant for 21 years . If we 're going to find a diversion to get into the railway station , we 'll find it here . What do you suggest , Walter ? There was a time when we solved Fringe cases . Now I think it 's time we created a few of our own . So this is every Fringe event ? Documented and preserved to the best of my ability . Oh , look , Olivia , my porcupine man . You really had no idea that he was doing any of this ? I wouldn 't have slept at night if I did . Some secrets are meant to be kept . For two reasons - number one : Because they 're mine . And number two : I have a healthy distrust of the government . These items were safer with me . Oh ! Put that down . You 'll Amber us . It 's an ambering device . Put it down gently . Hair trigger , if I recall correctly . There has got to be a better option for getting us into that train station than a portal that takes us to another universe . I suppose you 're right . We 'll have to go through all this to see what 's still viable . The answer is here somewhere . Oh , my goodness . What is it ? It 's my old doughnut hole . Jelly . It 's still spongy . It 's still good . Why am I still here ? Two days ago , you failed a security test . That 's why you 're nervous . So you are a recent graduate of the Academy ? Yes . And your date of induction ? April 25 , 2033 . Were your parents proud to see you in uniform for the first time ? My parents are deceased . Did you think of them during the ceremony ? I missed them being there if that 's what you mean , yes . What was the weather like ? What ? That important day , what 's the weather ? It was sunny . On April 25 , 2033 in Boston , rainfall began approximately at 10 : 20 a. m . And continued steadily well into the evening . You were never at the Academy . No , you 're mistaken . I was class 58693-A . You are a member of the resistance . Someone forged your paperwork to be installed in your position . You cannot conceal it . I can see it . Right there . What do you know about the fugitives ? Where is Peter Bishop ? Where did he go ? Where are the fugitives hiding ? You overheard Anil say something ? What did you hear Anil say ? Forget about him for a second . I saw something else ... that interests me . The Dove . Who is the Dove ? Hmm ? What is his real name ? I don 't know ! Nobody does . What did you discover ? He is a low-level operative . His information is limited . I found bits and pieces , but not everything . We 've heard the name " the Dove " three times now . What else ? When I said the name " Peter Bishop , " he recalled a moment when he overheard Anil mention a lab in sector B. I think you know this as the old Harvard University . I thought you would recognize it . You had a relationship with these fugitives that I thought we would call upon . Now how did you know that ? That I had a relationship with them ? Captain Windmark told me . He said he was going to ask you about it . He did not ? I knew them , but that was a long time ago . According to this man 's knowledge , they are in the lab . I will make my report . Pull . Walter . Technically this is a weapon of mass destruction . So is the mosquito that carries the West Nile . This will do beautifully . A perfect delivery system . Looks like there are more Loyalists . What was the count before ? Three , four . Now it 's seven . It 's not going to be easy getting into this subway station . Where 'd you get that ? I found it at our old house on Quincy Street . I wanted to remember things . I don 't know . I just wanted to be there . It made me feel closer to you . It was looted . The entire block was . Upstairs in your bedroom , what used to be your bedroom , I found what was left of your old jewelry box . And there was this matchbox inside . I shook it and found this . I figured it had to be important or you wouldn 't have kept it . How long have you been wearing it ? Since I was 13 . You want it back ? No . No . No , I want you to keep it . Let me see it . You know your father used to call this " The bullet that saved the world . " The lab 's been compromised . Peter . What 's wrong ? We need to go now . Well , we 're ready . No , the Observers know that we 're in the lab . How ? Who told you that ? Somebody I trust . We don 't have time . We cannot leave the lab . Without the tapes , we have nothing . Forget the blueprints . Forget the rocks from the mine . Forget whatever is in the tomb . None of it means anything without the plan . There goes the world . The world ending . Once they see we 've been here , we 'll never be able to set foot in the lab again . I have an idea . Walter , we need to re-Amber the lab . There 's nothing here . It 's just an ambered lab . Control , the building is secure . 1-6 heading back down . Copy that . Confirm . Return to base . No one has been in that lab . The reading from the prisoner was deceptive . How is that possible ? Somehow she hid her thoughts from us , deceived our readings . Perhaps others can as well . Still on watch . You 're relieved then . Perimeter . Hi . Perhaps you can help me . I 'm trying to get to Kennebunkport , Maine . Let me see your travel authorization . Of course . Thing is , I 've been driving around in circles . I was hoping you might help me with these directions . I will handle this . The thing is , I 'm a bit lost . You electrocuted me . Your authorization - now . Of course . Here we are . They 're gonna meet us around back . Here we go . All right , Walter . You 're up . Where is it ? There . Kilroy ? I drew that . It must be in the vent . There 's a line . It 's got something heavy . It 's the tube . Let 's go . Peter ! Unh ! There ! I 'm in . Go , go , go . What 's written on it , Walter ? It 's some kind of physics . It 's beyond anything I 've ever seen . I don 't understand . Well , Walter , it 's your handwriting , so , even if it was wiped from your mind , you must have understood it at some point . Perhaps it was dictated to me . By September ? You think he gave you these equations ? I don 't know . Do you think you 'll be able to figure it out ? Don 't you understand ? This is Greek to me , except that I read Greek . This is Aramaic to me . Not the western dialect . I do speak a little . Walter ? I don 't know what this is . I 'm sorry . Okay , well , we should get back to the lab . Not yet . Somebody wants to see you . Agent Dunham . Phillip . It 's good to see you , Dr. Bishop . Peter . I asked her not to tell you in case ... We were read . When I heard that you were back , I tried not to , but I had to see you . Five years ago , I got called to a crime scene outside the city , and I saw Etta for the first time . And , even though she was turned away from me , I could have sworn I was looking at you . It wasn 't until I told her who I was that she admitted the truth , that she was your daughter . Once I knew , I had her transferred into my section . I had a mind I was gonna look after her , but she taught me . She recruited me in the resistance , taught me how to block them from reading my thoughts . How long did that take ? Nearly a year . They used an airborne toxin . It hyperactivates a protein that generates scar tissue . Barbaric . What was their purpose here ? They took something that was hidden inside . What , we don 't know . Captain Windmark . Yes . One of our men died holding this . I think we 're gonna be able to find them . HK pistols with rechargeable power cells . Pulse rifles , motion sensors , scent cones . Anti-matter batons ? Fourth gen . Delayed fuse . Blast radius of 100 meters . And , once it 's armed , it can 't be deactivated , so when you use it , make sure you don 't stick around . How on earth did you get this stuff ? It wasn 't simple . Tell Anil he owes me . Seeing you makes me realize how much I miss Boston . Maybe I 'll put in for a transfer . It 's all right . I 've apprehended them . They found you . How ? They put a tracker on us . That loyalist before we drove off . You can 't let ' em find you here with us . You won 't make it by car . Run . Protect the plan at all costs . Peter ! Go ! Get out of here ! We can 't stay here . The far end . Down there . There . They know we 're in here . Cover every entrance . Walter , run . I 'll cover you . Cover me while I get to the stairs . We 've got to go back for them . We will . We 're gonna double back . Ready ? Go ! Walter ! Go , go ! On your six . Clear it , clear it . Move , move ! Walter ? Peter ? Unh ! He bought the necklace for you . For what purpose ? I would like to know . Love . You never know when to give up . Etta . Etta . No . No , no , no . Henrietta , look at me , okay ? You 're going to be okay . Etta ? But we have to move you , okay ? No . There 's no point . We 're not gonna leave you here . You have to . You won 't make it with me . I 'll slow you down . You have to leave . Etta . I love you so much . I know . No . No , no . No . I can 't leave you . Not again . No . No . Son , we have to go . We 're sweeping buildings two and three now , but there 's no sign of them . Love . They would go back for her . You were wrong . The necklace . We need to leave . She 's gone , son . We have to go . She 's gone , son .

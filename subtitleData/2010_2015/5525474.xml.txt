 Agent . Excuse me . She 's got next shift . You guys keep taking my girls , you 're gonna put me out of business . Get a new girl . You seem to be quite agitated . What are you doing , agent ? He 's a Native . My jurisdiction . Sorry he acted out , Captain Windmark . I mean , you could wipe him , sure but then there 's the inquiry , the paperwork club gets shut for two days , and I , for one , lose a hell of a lot of kickbacks . We need to wipe him . You okay ? I must say , agent . You are always exactly what you seem . Can you stand ? Go home , Kitty . - Take the rest of the night off . - Thanks , Rick . What are you , stupid ? What can I say ? I 'm a gentleman . I had to piss him off so he 'd try and wipe me otherwise he would have read me . But he read you . And you fooled him . How the hell did you do that ? Just lucky , I guess . Lucky ? They find out about you , they 'll kill you . Hell , they find out there 's anyone like you , they 'll probably kill us all . I love being special . You 're late . I said 6 . It 's 8 . They added two new checkpoints downtown . You said important . Oh , baby . You don 't know the half of it . Remember all those times I said you were nuts ? Looks like I was wrong . Go ahead . Does anyone else know about this ? No , of course not . Oh , my God . - Where are the others ? Were they ... ? - Yeah . Two more . Man and a woman . Younger . Right where I found this one . Heat was rising . I couldn 't move them all at once . - Where ? - The city . Inside the ... Attention , curfew is now in effect . Natives , please return to your homes immediately . Loyalists hung a few resistance fighters from Copley Plaza mall . We need to cut them down . We have two containment breaches in Back Bay . And curfews . People are getting brave . Don 't let them . - Where have you been , agent ? - Sir , I ... Walk with me . Now . - Late . - I know . - Very . - Sorry . Very . I need a coffee . I could use some air myself . I remember when you used to be able to drink this stuff . You are old . So , what 's wrong ? Rick 's dead . - What ? - Loyalists killed him . Damn it , Etta . Black-market tech gets people killed . Even cops . - Black-market tech replaced your eyes . - I don 't need a history lesson . - You were gonna stop running civilians . - I had an open order with him . - From the old days . I never cancelled it . - An order for what ? Any info on the missing team . Really ? Again ? - Let this go . - Simon ... It 's a myth , Etta . The original Fringe Team didn 't vanish . They aren 't missing . They died . They aren 't coming back to save us . They aren 't in the desert , or Peru or immortal . You 're right . They 're in amber . And I 've got one of them right here . Well , I 'll be a toe on a foot in a grave . That 's the amber device . He did this on purpose . What could have been so terrible that he ambered himself ? And his team . Rick said the others were with him . Once we get Bishop out he can tell us where they are . - Let 's not get ahead of ourselves yet . Agent . - No , thank you . - Don 't be rude , Phillip . - Have a drink with me . - It 's water . It doesn 't do anything for me . It hydrates you . Yes , I suppose it does . As much as I would 've enjoyed eliminating him myself Native-on-Native killing cannot stand . Not on my watch . I heard . And , no , we don 't have any leads . - This is the fourth this month . - I can count . I like you , Phillip . But be assured bite my hand and I will put you down . Your division is in charge of Native crime . Or would you rather I was in charge of Native crime ? I don 't think you 'd like my methods . I 'll get you a suspect . Good . Windmark . What did you do up there in the future to get yourself such a crap detail ? I like animals . Third generation amber . No reverse protocols . Durable stuff , this . There 's no way to revert it to its gaseous form ? I didn 't say that . Oh , dear . It 's a good look on you . Heh . It looks like the amber can only be reverted to its gaseous state momentarily . He won 't have enough time to emerge safely . By the time he 's aware enough to step out of it the gas will have resolidified , capturing him again . Couldn 't we just push him out ? Not unless you want to end up encased in that stuff yourself . - Hey . - Hey . What 's it for ? Hell if I know . Heh . You know Simon . You know not everyone trusts Simon . - My friends ... - Your friends in the city ? Some think he 's allowed the resistance to operate a little too freely . He had better have a good reason for checking out old , level-two tech . - Because my friends ... - In the city . They 're gonna be watching . A girl like you might wanna watch her P 's and Q 's . Wouldn 't wanna do the wrong thing . I 'll keep that in mind . Fire in the hole . Wow . Crowd control . Back before the Loyalists decided it was easier just to use bullets . Quite proud of these little babies . - When I say . - Really ? I was gonna go before . Okay , buffers are communicating . Ready ? Three two one . - I didn 't say " now . " - You were late . Dr. Bishop . My name is Agent Simon Foster . It is a great honor for me to meet you , sir . And you , young lady . You 're very pretty . Heh . Etta . We just removed you from amber , Dr. Bishop . - You were inside 20 years . - Twenty years . It 's no wonder I 'm so hungry . Do you have anything to eat ? This was ... Is your favorite food . That 's what they say . The stories , I mean . Mm . Mm . Mm . That 's lovely . Thank you . Records indicate that after the invasion you and your team discovered a way of getting rid of the Observers . These are the blueprints for the device you were working on . But we believe before you could finish it , you and your team were ... Were you all caught in amber ? - What do you call it ? - We don 't know . We thought it was some kind of beacon . No , no , no , you silly Billy . This . - The same as you . We call it licorice . - Licorice . Licorice . Licorice . Who are you ? You 're quite pretty . Licorice . Do you have Ring Dings ? Dr. Bishop ? I need you to try and stay perfectly still . - Walter . - Yes , I hear you , Peter . I will try not to move . Here . Try this . His neural pathways have degraded . It looks as if he 's experienced some sort of trauma . Probably because he was so close to the blast horizon of the amber . - Yeah . Brain damage . - Hmm . Well , how do we fix him ? I don 't know . She 'll be here in a moment . Your meeting , it 's about to take place . You wanted to see me , agent ? Yes . We 're waiting on touch screens for headquarters . They 've been back-ordered for months . Well , I don 't know how to break this to you , agent but your needs are the lowest thing on my list of priorities . - I understand that . It 's ... - Or perhaps even lower . And how is it that you always manage to come during my lunch hour ? Walk me to my car . I 'm sorry . I can 't hide my thoughts from them the same way that you can . Have you made any progress with Walter 's device ? Well , yes and no . - And the others , are they ... ? - Unclear . If Dr. Bishop knows where they are , he 's unable to tell us . Well , why not ? Do I know you ? Yes , Walter . It 's Nina . Nina Sharp . We 've known each other for many years . It 's good to see you again . In that case , it 's good to see you too . So , what do you think , Ms. Sharp ? Can you help fix him ? Of course you understand the risks of wanting to save the world . Well , they say he did it once before . He and his team . Yes , they did , but not without great consequence . I can 't fix him . But I have an idea . Massive Dynamic has long had a piece of Walter 's brain that was surgically removed and kept in a locked vault . It 's entirely possible that you could use that material to inspire Walter 's brain to heal itself . They removed a piece of his brain ? Well , William Bell did . It was at Walter 's request . Why ? I don 't think he liked the person he was becoming . So can you go get it and bring it out here ? Well , no , it 's not as simple as that . The old brain tissue , it 's very fragile . Neural matter can decay in seconds . You can 't just carry it around in a Petri dish . Why do I feel like you 're trying to bury the lead ? The material isn 't here . It 's still at our old facility . In the city . That 's wall-to-wall Observers . We 've done harder . - You really should get this fixed . - Hmm . All right , Simon . Walter , stop it . Uh , no , we 've just been catching up . Yes . No , he 'll be ready when you get here . Walter , Etta and Simon got the transit passes . - What on Earth are you doing ? - Try it . Wha ... ? Oh . I do hope we 're going to the circus . Heh . Walter . Observers may proceed to Platforms 6 through 26 for service . Snacks . Do you think they 'd have any of that delicious lic ... ? - Monster . - Shh . It 's okay . - Monster ! - We gotta get him off the street . Hold up there . What seems to be the matter ? Fringe agents . No matter . We 're just heading downtown . I see . I trust you have papers . Of course . - What 's your name , prisoner ? - Prisoner ? I most certainly am not . - Look at me . Do I look like a ... ? - He 's not a prisoner . He 's her grandfather . We 're taking him to visit my grandmother 's grave . - Today 's the anniversary of her death . - I am not a number . I am a free man . As you can see , he 's crazy . We just checked him out of the home for the day , but it was last minute . We didn 't have time to do the paperwork . These aren 't the droids you 're looking for . Heh . I 'm sorry . I 'm sure you can understand . Next time , I won 't be so nice . - Thank you . - Move along . Nice . - You okay ? - Yes . Wonderful . It 's quite the adventure , isn 't it ? Yeah , I suppose it is . Like The Guns of Navarone . Deja vu . What ? I feel like I 've been here before . You have . Many times , I imagine . Though , that was a long time ago . I hope it was cleaner then . This dust is revolting . There 's been a break-in at the old Massive Dynamic . Massive Dynamic ? Yes , sir , underground parking garage . Are we sure it isn 't a fault in the system ? - It 's been buggy lately . - I ran diagnostics . It 's not a false alarm . This is Agent Broyles . I need to talk to Captain Windmark . How 's it look ? I can 't say . I 've no idea how it 's supposed to look . What is that ? Monkey feces ? That , Dr. Bishop is your brain . We need an inactive medium to transfer the neural tissue . A mixture of saline and polysorbate 80 , 3 cc 's of each . Have you seen it ? Monkey feces ? No , I can 't say I 've had the pleasure . Well , I wouldn 't say that it was a pleasure . First I need you to take these pills . They 're diazepam mostly . They 'll put you into a deep sleep for 10 minutes . They 'll quiet your brain to allow the process to occur faster . You 're a clever boy . Dare I ask ? Synthetic neurotrophins . Growth proteins . If this process works it should allow his brain to absorb the tissue in minutes . I 've eaten it once . It was sweeter than you 'd think . - Feces ? - Heh . God , no . Brains . And LSD . I love LSD . Okay , ready . Dr. Bishop , we 're going to inject that solution into the base of your brain . Oh , fun . What was your name again ? - Simon . - Simon . Like in the game . Simon Says . I 'm going to have to listen to you . Isn 't that right , young lady ? Yes , he 's a very smart boy . Okay , this may look scary . - But you won 't feel a ... - I suddenly feel very tired , Simon . Here . Simon says , " Go to sleep now , Walter . " What if this doesn 't work ? Dr. Bishop . It has to . When I was in my freshman year at college , I 'm at Stanford and in the middle of the night , my roommate comes banging on my door . Tells me to wake up , come check out the TV . Heh . I tell him to go away . I have a girl in my bed . But he won 't take no for an answer . So me and the girl , heh Emily we get dressed and go to the common room . On the TV they 're showing footage from Chicago , L. A London . Observers going from house to house and dragging people out into the street . That was 2015 , the purge . I 'm watching people being dragged from their homes , led into the street , I mean . Put down like dogs . And suddenly I knew . I don 't know how , but I knew . That 's why my parents sent me so far away for school . They were part of the resistance . They ... They sent me away to protect me . That was the night they were killed . And that was the night I knew I wouldn 't give up until the Observers had gone . You never told me that . I never told anyone that . I was only 4 the last time I saw my parents . I can 't even picture their faces anymore . Dr. Bishop ? Are you okay ? I believe that 's mine , young man . Agent Simon Foster . Fringe Division . Pleased to meet you , sir . - What year is it ? - 2036 . And they 're still here ? The Observers ? - Assessment ? - Sir , I count three sets of footprints . Ready weapons . Protocol ? Shoot first . I 'll read them later . Sir , 12th floor is clear . Okay , proceed to the 13th . Can you build it ? Walter ? They weren 't all bad , you know . One of them even tried to help us . He was called September . What happened to him was , well , unexpected . He told me that in the year 2609 AD they finally ruined the planet . They poisoned it . The air . The water . And when it was fundamentally uninhabitable then they traveled back through time and took our planet from us . Yes , I can build it . Okay , good . It will take some time . But it would be easier if you didn 't have to do it alone , wouldn 't it ? If you had your team with you to help you . You were trapped in amber with them , right ? Do you remember where that was ? Do you remember where we can find the others ? You . Elevator . Did you forget to disable the internal alarms ? What are you people , idiots ? This way . Neither Belly or I ever left ourselves only one way out of a room . Come on . Warm . They were just here . How 'd they get out ? Step back . Keep going . Two lefts , then a right . How do we open it ? - What ? - Where 's Bishop ? We gotta get out of here . They 're coming . Give me your watch . - What ? - Your watch , now . What are you doing ? What is this ? Resistance must take place at any opportunity . We are insurgents . And this is antimatter . You 're smart , you do the math . What are you waiting for ? Come on . Sir , in here . - I know where they are . - Who ? The others . My team . I know where we were ambered . We should hurry . It 's not far from here . So ... Are you gonna tell me what that was all about ? Back at Massive Dynamic . You and Bishop ? You see him . He 's half a fruitcake short of Christmas . Heh . Yeah . Yeah , he is , isn 't he ? The wand should be just about powered up . I 'll check on it . And you 're certain it was Agent Foster ? Yes , agent . Foster , a woman and a man Foster claimed was her grandfather . But with a prisoner transport ID . You may play fast and loose up there in Boston . But here , rules and regulations matter . I can certainly take this up with downtown . No , I can handle my agents . Agent Romick . Activate Agent Foster 's tracker and assemble a team . You designed these yourself ? Augmentation buffers . Yeah . One goes on either side down by her feet . Not bad . You know I think you 're just what we 've been waiting for . Someone to show people that we don 't just have to accept our fate . That we can fight back . That we can use our will and our imagination to make a better world . - A better life . - In that case a little more focus , a little less pontificating we might have the job done by now . Right . Ready ? On three . One . Two . Three . Etta , the injection . - Unh ! Where am I ? - You 're okay . I 'm Etta . I 'm gonna give you an injection to help you breathe . - Hello , Astro . - Walter . - Where 's ... ? - This is not good . What ? I think I broke the wand . Can you fix it ? Ah , I can try . Set up the buffers and I 'll see what I can do . Shh . It 's not green . The activation light , it 's red . No , actually , it 's going back and forth . Something 's wrong . The buffers are having trouble communicating with each other . That doesn 't make any sense . There 's nothing in here to interfere with the signal . No phones , no radio waves . What is it ? My tracker . They must have activated it . We need to get him out of here . - But how would they know it 's us ? - I don 't know . But they know we 're here . There must be enough of a signal in here to trigger the amber . The wand is broken . How do we get him out ? I don 't know . I hear sirens . We have to leave . We have to get him out of there now . Okay , I have an idea . Here , take this . When I say " now " trigger the amber . - But ... Three . Two . Heh . One . We need him . - Simon . - Do it . Now . Sub-level , go . Three , take position . Let 's go . At the stairs . Two is clear . Sir . William Bell , you just left him there ? You remember what he did to Olivia . Even you can 't be that compassionate . But we need him , don 't we ? Otherwise , how are we gonna get access ... ? It 's okay . We have everything we need . I 'm sorry about your friend . We 'll do everything we can to get him back . I promise . Do you know me ? I don 't know how I could . I 've been stuck in that amber for over 20 years . You barely look old enough ... Henrietta ? Hi , Dad .

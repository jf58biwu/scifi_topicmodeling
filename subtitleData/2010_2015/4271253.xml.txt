 Carpathia , this is CT-9 . Can you hear me , Carpathia ? Captain Kellerman from CT-9 calling Carpathia . We 're approaching your atmosphere . Are there any human beings out there ? Tyger ! Tyger ! burning bright In the forest of the night . HE SHOUTS : Mummy ? Busy ... deaf . Remember how I tried to teach you the difference ? I saw lights in the sky . There 's nothing . Is it the transporter with the new people ? They 're too far away for us to see their lights . D 'you think they 'll know about the tigers ? Well ... Will they , Mummy , will they know ? Of course they 'll know , and I bet there still were tigers on Earth when they left , in zoos at least . Now , I want you up and out of here in one minute , starting now . Tyger ! Tyger ! burning bright In the forests of the night . Mitchell . We were expecting you tomorrow . Well , you know about the new rules . No weapons inside Forthaven itself . All my PAS officers have handed theirs in , even me . We 're not PAS officers , Stella , we 're expeditionaries . OK , but you 're still not supposed to be soldiers . Your job is to resear ... Don 't tell me my job . .. to research the planet and its resources . Look , the main issue here , Mitchell , is that I don 't have to justify it to you now . It was passed by General Council and everybody will respect that . PAS and XPs alike . BEEPING It 's the comms room . Could be the transporter . We might have made contact at last . Check the weapon in , Mitchell . Carpathia , this is CT-9 . Can you hear me , Carpathia ? Carpathia , this is CT-9 . 'Carpathia , this is Captain Kellerman from CT-9 . ' We hear you , Captain . We hear you . Is that a human voice ? This is Richard Tate , President of Carpathia , as human as you are . 'Flash up that we have voice contact with Carpathia . ' We 've got visuals now . 'Captain , I 'm switching from antimatter to normal controls . ' 'I can see you now . ' It 's been so long , Captain . Over five years waiting and hoping for more arrivals . We thought there would be no more arrivals . There might not be now . We 've lost all signals from the ships in our departure flotilla . Well , I can 't tell you what it means to have your signal . What 's your status , Captain ? We 've got a couple of higher-than-normal protocols on the right side of the ship . Fatigue damage . It 's important you deal with that . Heat stress on atmospheric entry has been an issue for some transporters . How much of an issue ? Catastrophic , in some cases . HE SIGHS OK , it 's best to know the truth . I appreciate your honesty . And Earth ? We lost their pulse signal some years ago . We picked up some data . Anybody still down there is ... .. not having such a good time of it . Well , let 's keep the important questions for when you 're in . 'I do have one question , actually . ' Fire away . What 's the weather like on Carpathia ? Admirable priorities , Captain . Um ... Occasional whiteouts caused by our lunar system , but on the whole ... nice and warm . I need to patch things up out here . Don 't go anywhere . Keep beating . Keep beating . CHILD : Daddy ! How 's my boy ? I 'm practising my poem to welcome the transporter . Really ? Pablo Zavaleta is going to sing Gracias A La Vida . Well , that will make five years hurtling through space seem worthwhile . Where 's your mum ? Karina ? Hi ! Pablo 's parents came from a place called Chile . Is there tigers at Chile ? Not that I remember . Armadillos , chinchillas , jaguars maybe ... but tigers , I 'm not sure . You 're early . We weren 't expecting you till tomorrow . Yeah , I came back to show them what I thought of their weapons ban . I bumped into Stella . She said PAS officers had already given them up . I don 't mind . It 's not like I 've ever used mine . Not long now . We 're nearly ready . We 're nearly ready , Karina . What about Linus ? Linus ? Linus will be fine , won 't you ? He 'll be better . It 's good to see you . Right ... PIGLET GRUNTS You 're not on duty yet , Cass . I heard we had visuals with the transporter . Came straight here . Is it true ? It 's true . PIGLET GRUNTS What ? Oh , yeah ! Er ... Number 4 , meet Dr Stella Isen . Not just the head of Protection and Security , but the brainiest woman in the whole universe . Couple of guys in Food and Distribution made four of these . What happened to numbers 1 to 3 ? Not in front of 4 . I didn 't know General Council had approved any livestock clones . No , it was done on the sly . Renegade carnivores getting their bacon fix . That and some black market action , I 'd imagine . And we intervened just before they ... ( lit the coals under her curly little tail . ) Stop it . You 'll have me crying in a minute . So ? Thermal shield damage . Shit ! Captain 's apparently very competent . They 're doing repairs in orbit . They have a good chance . Maybe your family are on board . There have been far too many maybes already , Cass . Get the pig out of my office . Come on , Pork Chop . HE GRUNTS PIGLET SQUEALS DOOR OPENS I need to go to work . Do you love me ? You know I do . I 've never loved anybody else . And trust me ? Of course . Linus will be fine . And the others left behind ? It 's only been ten years . We were pioneers before . We 'll be pioneers again . I 'd miss Forthaven . It 's a hutch , Karina . All Tate wants is a bunch of satisfied rabbits . Well , I like my work and our friends and ... You 'll like where we 're going better . There 's a whole planet out there . I need to take Linus to school before my shift . You would never betray me ? Hmm ? Anyone else in PAS finds out what we 're planning ... I 'll always do what I think is right for Linus . This is the right thing , trust me . DOOR CLOSES I 've spoken at last to the captain of Transporter 9 , which is now orbiting Carpathia . 'They are entering the most dangerous part of their journey . 'I will be in constant contact with Captain Kellerman' and will keep you informed of all developments . 'All public screens will now show the transporter 's position 'and significant flight data . 'Let 's all unite in hope for the safe arrival of our brothers and sisters nearing the end of their long voyage from Earth . Mitchell 's back , a day earlier than I expected . Mmm ... bet he 's pleased with the weapons ban . When Linus was a baby I used to take him down to the fence when the expeditionaries came home , hold him up high above the fence so Mitchell could see him . Nobody goes to welcome them back any more . No , and that hurts him . He needs to be adored . Oh ! Nothing more boring and annoying in MY book . You just haven 't found Mr Right yet . The day I say I have , feel free to shoot me . WIND RUMBLES I love a girl in uniform . What did he just give you there ? Nothing . Yeah , he did . I know you . You work in medical distribution . Slinging a bit of unofficial SP on the side ? You should try some , girls . Open your minds , expand your horizons . My horizons are just fine . Sorry , gentlemen , we 're going to have to take you into PAS . We 're charging you with two code violations . Oh , officers ! Isn 't there some other way to sort this out ? I 'd literally do anything you ask . You 're fresh ! RUMBLING It 's gonna white out . Hey ! Hey ! Fleur , leave him . SHE SHOUTS : Everybody get down ! 'I 've lost him , Karina . Are you OK ? ' It 's back rolling , Fleur . We 're OK . Agh ! Ugh ! Stop ! Karina ! Karina ! Karina ! Cass , it 's Fleur . Karina 's down . Karina ! Karina , can you hear me ? Karina , please ! Who was it ? We were talking to a couple of SP deadbeats . One of them goes by the name of Tipper Malone . I 'll break his scrawny neck . I didn 't say it was him . We were questioning , there was a whiteout , it happened so fast . Yeah , I 'll break his neck anyway . Put a detention order on all the screens for Tipper Malone . You OK ? Who could hurt her ? She can 't die . Not Karina . Everything that can be done is being done for her . As soon as they tell us anything , you 'll be the first to know . Where 's Mitchell ? We 're trying to find him . I 've also sent a couple of officers to inform Linus 's teachers . You think he might have discovered something ? We do have another suspect . Who ? Tipper Malone , some black-market loser . And why would he want to hurt her ? I don 't know , I want to DBV him . You need to get back to the transporter . What if Mitchell did find out ? Look , let 's just take things one step at a time . We asked her to spy on her own husband , Stella ! Yeah , who was plotting to break away and destroy everything we 're building here . But she did love him , and it was agony for her . She knew her duty and she was doing it . Listen , you need to focus on helping the transporter captain and let me deal with this . So everybody knew that our only hope was to find a planet in what is called a Goldilocks Zone . That means just close enough to a star - not too near and not too far . The right size , as well . Wait a moment , children . Why did you attack a PAS officer ? I didn 't . I just swapped a few bits and bobs for a few other bits and bobs . You were getting controlled medicines that are supposed to help sick people . Real sick people , not just sick-in-the-head people . That 's not very nice . Anyway , I take great offence at your outdated elitism . Do you , now ? I 'm the voice of liberty . Yeah , well , I 'm the voice of f ... This is ... I know who it is . Deep brain visualisation . You know about that , too ? Yep . If you have nothing to hide , it may well prove your innocence . I 'd like your consent rather than applying for an order . Are you doing it personally ? Well , the human brain is still my main area of interest . Then get ready to be fascinated , Doc . Captain ? 'There 's growing panic among the passengers . 'They know there 's something wrong and they 're just ... 'desperate to get in now . ' Well , you can 't attempt atmospheric entry until your ship is ready . 'Yeah . 'It 's difficult to explain that to people 'who 've been living under these conditions for five years . 'We also have a lot of children and newborns . ' That 's very welcome news for us . Um ... With your permission , Captain , have your comms system patch me through to the entire ship . 'Clear to speak now , Carpathia . ' Passengers of CT-9 , this is President Richard Tate from Forthaven , Carpathia . Many of you won 't know why we named our new planet Carpathia . It was to honour the rescue ship that came to pluck survivors out of the freezing seas after the Titanic disaster on Earth . The name reflected the hope we had that our new home would be a similar refuge , providing safety and warmth after a time of great danger . And we 've done our best to achieve that in the ten years we 've been here . We came to a planet where we weren 't even sure if we 'd survive the first days . And now our solar engineers have given us energy , our scientists have provided us with food ... .. and our expeditionary teams keep making exciting discoveries about our new home . I know you feel as if you 're in the deepest darkness now ... .. but my voice will always be beside you , and the light is such a short distance away . You 're not on your own . There are thousands of us down here waiting for you . There is warmth and there is safety on Carpathia . APPLAUSE What is it ? 'They 're clapping . People are clapping . ' Well , I guess there 's a first time for everything . Did you know that the part of the brain that deals with the memory is called the hippocampus ? It means " sea horse " . Do you remember the sea , Tipper ? Sea horses are unusual creatures because it 's the men that carry the eggs and give birth . Every day , the male and females have greeting sessions . Now , you had a meeting with someone this morning , didn 't you , Tipper ? How is she ? DBV 's done . Wasn 't Tipper . Stella wants us to find Mitchell . He 's back , then ? Early . Karina told me that this morning . No , Mitchell wouldn 't hurt her . Apart from his ego , Karina and Linus were all he cared about . She said he got jealous real quick . Mitchell 's a bit of a crazy gun-head now , but he wasn 't always like that . Did good things for us at the start . He was the first to go into the mountains . Found the first water , brought the stuff back for medicine , at a time when we had no idea what was out there . He 's brave . People still remember that . Let 's find out why he 's not at her bedside , then . Weapons ban 's working well . Yeah , um ... We 're here for the ballet lessons ? Where 's Mitchell Hoban ? HE TAPS ON RAIL We 're just here to talk , Jack . You wait here . You 're the boss . Women , eh ? When Mitchell surfaces , tell him we need to speak urgently . I heard his wife got herself hurt . " Got herself " ! Her name 's Karina . I think you know that , right ? She 's a snake . What ? Ask your bosses . They had her spying on him . Then he must 've been doing something wrong . I 'll tell you this . You come after Mitchell and there 's going to be a fight . See how much your weapons ban means then . We 're going to find the person who hurt Karina and we 're going to take them down . Whoever they are , whatever their status . Reassure Mitchell about that when you see him . Well ? They came low-key . Two PAS officers , unarmed . I wouldn 't rule out the cavalry , though . Jones . Sir ? Get me some provisions . Yes , sir . I 've one last thing to take care of , then I 'm heading out to the lake . I want you to follow me out there when you 've got everybody ready . Mitchell ... Yeah , what is it ? I still think it 's too early . It 's like I 've always said - when the time 's right . It has to be now , Jack . That 's why they 've brought in the weapons ban . It 's to weaken us . If she betrayed me like that , she must have betrayed me in other ways . I don 't think so , Mitchell . What do YOU know ? He said what ? Big fight if we try and detain him . I just can 't believe it . Just because he 's a poster boy , doesn 't mean ... Look , I don 't need a lecture on domestic violence , Fleur . I can still be shocked and sad . You actually liked Mitchell ? Not liked so much , but I respected him . Well , it 's not just domestic . Jack said she was spying on him for our bosses . What ? Well , Karina said nothing to me about it . Never thought things had got that bad with the XPs . Look , go to Karina and make sure she 's protected in case whoever it was ... I think we know who it was now . Go to the medicentre and double up her protection in case he comes back for a second snap . Where are you going ? Get some answers . How 's the mood on board , Captain ? 'Better , thank you . ' You carrying any VIPs , by the way ? I mean , everybody is , of course , but ... 'Margaret Baker , poet and Nobel Laureate ... ' Good . You can never have too many poets ! ' .. Haas , the climatologist . Julius Berger ... ' Berger 's on board ? 'Yes , did you know him on Earth ? ' He ran the Evacuation Programme . I knew him well . 'He 's ... quite an authority to the passengers . ' I 'm sure . Captain , I have somebody down here who has missing family . It 's a long shot , but I 'd like to put her mind at rest . 'I understand . What 's her name ? ' Stella Isen . Her family were due to follow her out . Her husband , Daniel Isen , and daughter , Lily . 'OK . ' MUSIC : " Parigi O Cara " from La Traviata by Verdi Surprised to see me ? You ordered my own wife to spy on me and report to you . What you were planning amounted to a coup . She did her duty . Well , you could have stayed here ... with your regulations and your lapdogs . Except part of your plan was to use Forthaven as a supply base for your new home . Well , she really did tell you everything , didn 't she ? And you certainly made her pay for it , you ignorant thug . What did you say ? What did you call me ? She loved you ... but she was far too good for you . Did you fall for my wife like everybody else ? No , don 't tell me , she let you ... You are vulgar as well as stupid . You did , though , didn 't you ? You couldn 't protect your own family so you thought you 'd help yourself to mine . Is there anything sadder or more pathetic than a jealous , strutting conquistador nobody needs ? They 're out there , Tate . They 're still outside the fence . Still brooding about what we did to them . You ordered their execution . Remember that ? You remember that ? Huh ? I spared them . I let them go . HE CHOKES They need me . They respect me . One word from me and they 'll destroy this place . I want you to know that before I kill you . THUMPS AND GROANS Mitchell , what have you done ? Back off , or I 'll kill you ! Cass ... I know about you , remember . Who you are . What you are . Never breathed a word , not to anybody . I still can 't just let you go . But can you stop me ? Just get back ! Get down ! I don 't want to shoot you , Cass . Just give up . It 's not too late . Look , just stop , Williams . Just let him go . Just stop , Mitchell ! Too late now , though , isn 't it ? Medics and PAS officers to Corridor Seven . We have a shooter in the building and two men down . We need a DO , but nobody is to approach him unarmed . The identity of the shooter is Mitchell Hoban . Williams ! When is Mummy coming home ? Soon . Why don 't we practise your poem again ? " Fearful symmetry " - that 's the line I always forget . Use something to remind you . With the same letters but easier to remember and linked . Like ... foot and shoe . Foot and shoe ? For " fearful " and " symmetry " . When you get to the line you can 't remember , just think foot and shoe . " What immortal hand or eye dare frame thy ... " Foot and shoe . SHE CHUCKLES Don 't worry , you 'll be fine . Do you think the tigers came back when there weren 't so many people hunting them ? Maybe . If we found a tiger here , would we start hunting them again ? That 's an excellent question , Linus . Answer that and you might have the key to our future . DOOR OPENS I 'm OK . Go find him . How come he 's gone this crazy ? What 's this about Karina spying on him ? We don 't have time for questions right now . Just detain him and protect Karina . Karina 's secure . Linus is with his teacher . I 'm gonna check he 's OK . After I 've checked my gun out again . Help ! BANGING Please , anyone ! Help me ! Stand back ! Somebody call PAS . What happened ? I tried to stop him , but he hit me . He 's taken the boy . You stay here . I 'll send someone round to get you . You understand ? You stay here . Where 's Mitchell ? He 's not in the base , there 's no point going in . You need to help us . This goes beyond loyalty . Unless you give us Mitchell , we 'll close down your base and detain you all for harbouring a murderer . The people will back us . You know that , you 're not stupid . Or you give up Mitchell and hang on to what you have . Choose . Your team or Mitchell Hoban ? I 'd advise you to back off . He 's a leader to these people . To most people . It 's not simple . Is it worth us searching any more inside the fence ? No . You 'd better get him to come back . That kid 's fate 's in your hands now . They 're looking for you . Tell everybody to come out and meet me by the lake . I warned you . I just don 't think that we 're ready for this yet . Are you turning against me as well ? You 're crazy . You remember who I am ? You 're the man I 've looked up to since I 've been here . I have to tell you ... Nothing . You tell me nothing . Tell everybody else I 'm waiting . What shall we do now , Daddy ? Smells of bureaucracy in here . Must make a nice change from dry piss and stale sweat . I need some assurances . For a murderer ? I don 't think so . Not for Mitchell . They 've got a secret place just where the Closed Zone begins . It 'll be where Mitchell was planning to build their settlement . OK , give me the directions . You ? Yeah . I 'm going with you . I don 't need ... OK , big boy ! We go together or not at all . How far is it ? About a day 's hike . Men can be a danger to their children when they think they have nothing to lose . We don 't stop until we find Linus . It 'll be dark before we get there . We need to move . There . What did I tell you ? Isn 't it beautiful ? So much water . Is this the sea , Daddy ? No , this is a lake . You want to go in ? But I don 't know how to swim . Well then , I 'll teach you . We can do whatever we like now . We 're free again . MONITOR BEEPS STEADILY How could he do this to you ? The doctors need to do some brain-stem tests . Cass and Fleur have gone out to find Mitchell . Gone out ? What , beyond the fence ? What is it ? Mitchell said something . What ? He said they were still out there . Who 's " they " ? No , it can 't be . We 'd know . He 's lying . He 's trying to unsettle you . Well , he 's succeeded . What if Cass and Fleur ... ? He 's lying . Cass and Fleur can look after themselves . You need to get some rest . Signal on the SRD 's gone , Cass . We are on our own now . Not much daylight left , either . We need to keep going , make up his head start . You heard what Stella said . She 's a feminist academic . Not going to say , " It 'll turn out for the best , " is she ? At least she doesn 't think violence is the answer to everything . And who does ? See , that 's the kind of stupid generalisation that really annoys me . It wasn 't women who designed , built and fired nuclear weapons . Nor did the millions of men who got turned into shadows on the pavements of Shanghai and Chicago . Right ? You can 't just ... Agh ! Agh ! Cass ! You OK , Cass ? I 'm all right , I 'm all right . What were you saying ? Funny ! I 've lost my kit . Help me up . That was close . Look , we need to stop before it gets dark . All right , as soon as we find some open space , we 'll set up camp . We 'll have to share my tent now . Don 't get any ideas . Yeah , right ! It 's the temptation for you I 'm worried about . Well , that 's going to be a struggle . Now you 're talking . BACKGROUND MUSIC PLAYING How 's tricks ? You got me under surveillance now ? Don 't think much of your disguise , Doc . We had to question you . You 're in the clear , obviously . I always knew that . Can I get a beer ? D 'you want another one ? And another one . You look fed up . Something else on your mind ? You might say that . Actually , do you want to get out of here and go somewhere else ? Somewhere else ? ( WHISPERS ) With the head of Protection and Security ? Don 't mess around . I won 't ask you again . Well ! You 've been inside my head , after all . Funny to think the transporter 's out there somewhere . You remember arriving ? I was scared . Didn 't want the journey to end . I was so excited . You know , me and Karina were holding hands when we first stepped off the ship . I remember her giving my hand a big squeeze cos neither of us could speak . Hard to imagine now . I kind of wish I could tell them . Tell them what ? Not to worry . How good it is here . That 's one thing I 've always liked about you . For all your other thousands of faults , you never whinge . I love Forthaven . My life . I wish it could stay like this forever . What ? You know , my Bolivian friend in F and D said that there 's a secret plan to clone little sheep we can eat as snacks . THEY LAUGH He might be pulling my leg . You think ? ! RUSTLING What 's that ? What 's what ? That noise . Let 's turn in . As soon as it 's light , we move again . Hope you don 't snore . You got family , Captain ? A confirmed bachelor , I 'm afraid . You ? I arrived with my wife . We had two boys . What happened ? When we were here first , we lost a lot of children to a ... terrible illness called C-23 . Only children ? Yes . Must have been terrifying . The most terrifying thing was , you could see it before it took hold . See it ? A sort of glimmering halo around the heads of its victims . I lost both my boys . And your wife ? Um ... Melissa never really ... She couldn 't come to terms with , er ... I understand . I 'm very sorry . Well , it 's why we 're so pleased there are children arriving . We have lost so many . I am not the only grieving parent . How did you get rid of it ? The virus ? We had to make some tough decisions . Quarantine ... .. that sort of thing . Didn 't you promise my passengers a place of safety and warmth ? Well , we 've done great things . I 'm proud to be made President . But of course things aren 't perfect down here , Captain . I didn 't come here expecting perfection . What did you expect ? A society of human beings with ... everything that involves . Well , one of our accomplishments is we brew a rather decent beer . And I 'll look forward to sharing one with you as soon as you arrive . I 'm sorry , I 'm getting our final status updates on our shield repairs . I ... I 'll get back to you as soon as they 're in . Well , I 'm not going anywhere . FOOTSTEPS Agh ! GUNSHOT You OK ? Yeah . You ? Yeah . Just about . What were they , Cass ? I don 't know . OK , this is bad . This is bad . Maybe Jack 's trying some kind of ... They weren 't expeditionaries . I don 't know . You keep saying that ! It 's true ! I don 't bloody know . What if it 's , I dunno , alien life ? Oh , don 't be stupid . I 'm not sleeping now . Nor me . First light , we 're out of here . We can 't go back now . I hope you can understand that , Linus . I loved you both . I loved you both so much . MACHINE BEEPS STEADILY Karina ? The tests ? We should know soon . I saw Daniel again . You 've been using DBV on yourself . We were at the opera , just before the second Taiwan crisis . I was pregnant with Lily at the time . We went to see La Traviata and Dan was crying at the end like he always did , the big softie . And as Violetta is singing that they 'll leave Paris together ... .. Dan 's big tears are falling into my hand . I could see everything as it was . I could feel the red velour of the seat , his hand squeezing mine . Stella , you must be careful . And then I went to the bar and I picked up some kid . The suspect we cleared , actually . Went back to his place . And how was that ? Surprisingly all right , actually , if a little brief . You know . I know you , Richard . You would have asked Kellerman . Lily 's on board . Daniel isn 't with her . Why not ? I don 't know . I didn 't want to tell you because ... I know why you didn 't tell me . You didn 't tell me because ... they 're still in danger , she might not make it . I can 't breathe . Carpathia , this is Kellerman . Go ahead , Captain . We 've done everything we can now . Our updates are positive . We 're performing final checks now and our estimated entry interface is plus one hour . I 've got that , Captain . Look . This is Captain Kellerman . Is Richard Tate there ? I 'm here , Captain . Thank you for all your support . Whatever happens now , your presence has been invaluable . We 're a few minutes away from entry interface . Executing standard de-orbit burn and roll . Our altitude is 50 miles . There 's plenty of plasma flare up here to keep us company . Keep your fingers crossed for us , Carpathia , we 're coming in . They 're crossing over the New Pacific Zone , about to enter Upper Caledonia . We 've got unusual stress readings , Carpathia . We 've got to move protocols , it 's starting to ... MAN : That protocol 's not working . We 've got a stress burn in our right ... Status is abnormal , Captain . Comms check . I 'm on UHF-7 . Can you hear me ? Well , they 're still in one piece . Cass ? Where 's Linus ? Congratulations on finding me . It 's beautiful here , isn 't it ? Where 's your son , Mitchell ? He 's over there . Don 't disturb him now . Is he OK ? Mitchell , have you hurt him ? We were going to build a new place here . Karina betrayed me . Go and get Linus . Don 't move . You have to come back with us now . That will be a problem ... for everybody . Karina probably won 't recover , by the way . You start all over again , you mess things up again . That 's just how it has to be . Right , Cass ? Mitchell , I want to see if Linus is OK . Protection and Security . We think they 're important . You seem to have lost touch with both . There are things about Tate you don 't know . I 'm sure there are . Things you should know ! Not for you to tell us . Nobody else will - certainly not that bitch Stella that you answer to . Watch your mouth . Go back to Forthaven , to your little cocoon . We will , with you . Don 't . Mitchell , don 't . Karina always said the best thing about Fleur was her idealism . Shut your mouth . But I could tell you some things . Shut your mouth now ! You 'll have to kill me to stop me killing him . Put the gun down ! I will kill him , you know I will . Do you really believe that human beings can live together in peace ? Do you really think we can build a better place for our children ? Yes , I do . CRACKLING Sir ! We 're fatally damaged , Carpathia . I 'm releasing our six emergency sub-shuttles . MAN : It 's too hot . We 're close to the end now , Captain . I will stay with the transporter and those that could not fit on the sub-shuttles . Try and land your ship , Captain . There must still be a chance . We 're breaking up . The readings are telling us it 's a certainty . Is Lily Isen on board ? Is she on one of the shuttles ? She 's my daughter . Please give priority to the young . It 's total chaos now , we 're running out of time . People are storming the Evacuation Zone . Not everyone has behaved with dignity . You have , Captain , always . You 're a good man . It 's been an honour to make your ... CRACKLING I can see Carpathia . I can see it all beneath me . It looks so ... so beautiful . WHIRRING BANG CONTINUOUS BEEP DISTANT EXPLOSION What is it ? I know what it looks like , but I don 't want to think ... I 'll go and wake Linus up . Yeah , we need to get him away from here . I 'll finish up . DISTANT EXPLOSION Poor souls . Fleur ! Hey ! We 're here to take you home . I was dreaming of tigers . Yeah ? Where 's my daddy ? He ... He had to go away , sweetheart . But we 're here to look after you now . Let me see my daughter again . Please , just let me see her again . Kellerman got close enough to save some of the passengers . There are survivors . Julius Berger was also on the transporter . From the Evacuation Programme ? Is he safe ? I don 't know . Well , what does that mean for us if he is ? I don 't know . But it will mean something . Tyger ! Tyger !

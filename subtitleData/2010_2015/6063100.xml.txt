You gotta be strong . Is everybody OK ? Are you hurt ? - No . I 'm okay . What now ? - We stay here . We keep watch and we pray that someone comes . He 's right . Someone 's gonna come . This can 't go on forever . Right ? Elaine . - Sweetie , it 's best if we stay together . I can 't . The smoke . Given the circumstances I think a smoke is more than reasonable . Candice . I 'm pregnant , alright ? And I just thought that- - Between all the stress It 's okay . I never even got to tell my mom . Come on , boss . Let 's let the girls get some sleep . You and I will keep watch . Both of us ? They try that light stuff , we got each other 's back . I hate L.A. I haven 't seen a soul all night . Maybe the worst is over . - Maybe not . What do you think those things really are ? - I don 't know . Does it even matter ? Just doesn 't seem real . Well it is real . You better wake up . What 's that supposed mean ? The city 's a vacant lot . We need to survive . There 's not going to be many of us left . Let me see . Somebody 's fighting back . What are you doing ? - I want to see what 's out there . Turn that off ! It 's too bright . No . - We can 't risk it ! Oh my God . Did you sleep at all ? Is it getting worse ? What ? - The marks on your skin . You know , when I looked in that light I couldn 't stand for 10 minutes . Who knows what it did to us . To our bodies . You remember the first moment when you saw it ? When it completely took over . Somehow you still felt .. .. powerful . I still do . Why don 't you take a seat ? Relax . All right . I 'll bite . What 's your plan , boss , cause I know you 're dying to tell me . Nothing to say ? We 're sitting on the marina , for chrissakes . - I 've noticed that . And there are hundreds of boats right across the street . We 've been through all this . - Remind us how that worked out last time . We go quietly this time . - And search every boat till we find the key ? If we have to . - Great plan , Jarrod . I can 't believe you 'd even suggest that after what happened . You make it sound like it was my fault . I was practically begging , but you wouldn 't listen . And you think Terry would have listened to me ? All right . Let 's say we make it out of the building . Across the marina , down the dock . We even find the boat and everything . And then what ? And then we get the hell out of dodge ! - Where to ? Catalina ? Down the coast ? Anywhere is better than here ! - How do you know ? We 're here . We 're alive . What was that ? What do you see ? Hallelujah . Come on ! - Come on ! Come on ! Everybody get down ! Jarrod ! Lainey ? - Yeah . It worked . I don 't believe it ! Is it over ? - It worked . It worked . Do you mind ? - By all means , boss . Do you think there are more planes where they came from ? Yes . Now they know what to do . They 'll be sending help in no time . What ? What is it ? - They 're not dead . They 're just really really pissed off . Something is happening . We 've got to cover these windows ! Come help me with this . Get back over here ! I 'll find something ! Here ! Jarrod ! What are you doing ? The only thing we can do . What 's this really about ? Those things will come in force . You think I haven 't noticed that mess under your shirt ? We stay here and hold up ! For good ! I agree . - What ? That he gets to decide everything ? We have no water . No power ! - Yeah , but you saw what 's out there ! Yeah , and I would rather make a run for it than stay in a 20 story target ! Between those things and the radiation we are dead up here ! Skid 's down ! - Move , move ! Go , go , go ! Come on , cover your sections ! Look ! Get off me ! - What do you think you 're doing ? ! We have to let them know that we 're here ! - We 'll let everyone know ! You 've been saying to wait for help . Well , help is here ! Does that look like a rescue chopper to you ? Come on- - - Don 't you get it ? ! We 're at war . Where are they going ? Helo 6 outbound . Those choppers are coming back for them . We have to go . Come on . If we get to the roof they 'll pick us up . - What if they don 't come back ? Elaine . - Look what happened to those planes . What good is a helicopter ? We have to take a chance ! - A chance ? They just nuked the city . And you want to wave hello ? Seriously , you need to back off ! We have to .. Oh shit ! You 're just gonna stand there ? What happens when the rest of the blinds fall ? We don 't exactly have enough bed sheets . Come on . How can you be so sure ? - Let 's just go ! You 're in no condition to decide anything ! And who knows what side you 're on ? ! I 'm warning you . Stop it ! Both of you ! - Look at his face . He 's sick . Don 't make me hurt you . - Oh don 't worry ! I am not leaving here without my family . And there is nothing that you can do to stop us . Lainey , you have to trust me . It 's me . It 's still me . I know . We have to go . We have to go . He 's gonna get her killed . - Come on . Come on . Alright , let 's go . Do you see anyone ? They 're right there . Help ! - Help ! Help ! - Help us ! Don 't move ! Don 't shoot us ! - No , no , wait ! Radio Helo 6 ! - We need help ! Please ! Go ! Walk slowly ! Come over here . Now ! No , no , no ! No ! They 're coming ! Come here ! - That 's it ! See those kids ? Get them out . Come on , come on , come on ! Hey ! - Hey ! Hey ! Pick those two up on the way out . Got it . We 've got a visual on them . We 're going there right now . Mayday ! Mayday ! Mayday ! What are you doing ? Shoot ! Shoot ! Mayday ! Mayday ! Help ! No ! Oh my God ! Come on . Help ! Get it off of me ! Help ! Hold still ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Come on ! Come on ! Where ? The scaffolding . It 's the only way down . Come on , go ! Come on ! Come on ! Jarrod ! Jarrod ! - Lainey , run !

 Previously on Fringe ... You nearly died when you were a boy . I became consumed with saving you . Walter , I don 't remember any of that . There is more than one of everything . I have said too much . I am not supposed to get involved . What did you people do to us ? Of the children that William Bell and I experimented on , you were the first to identify things from the other side . Was it me who described it as a glimmer ? I 've never met anyone who can do the things that you do . I 'll go get my coat . Please don 't tell him . Our success thus far should serve as an example of our ability to achieve that which most can 't even imagine . What you must understand is that , as scientists , we must embrace every possibility . No limitations . No boundaries . There is no reason for them . Gentlemen ... I would like you to take a look at this . It 's a mobile telephone . It can be made much smaller , I assure you . Does this work ? Not here , not yet . This phone is digital , not analog . It 'll take us 30 years to get up to speed . I didn 't invent it . I wish I had . Dr. Bishop , we were under the impression Dr. Bell would be here this evening . I 'm afraid that 's not possible . Dr. Bell is in Europe . But I am here , so I can answer any questions you may have . Dr. Bishop , is this Russian technology ? It is not . It is quite American . But ... It is technology from another universe . An alternate universe just like ours ... But more advanced in some area . Are you suggesting you somehow visited this alternate universe and acquired this advanced technology ? No , it is exactly impossible to go there . Then how did you come to possess this ? I copied it . For the last several years , William and I have been conducting various experiments regarding this other universe . So based on our findings , we developed a window of sorts , a way of looking into this neighboring world . And that is why we are asking for funding . This is my colleague , Dr. Carla Warren . Hello , sirs . This window works by capturing errant photons from the universe beside ours . The window essentially stretches the membrane between our worlds and allows us ... to see their image from our side . You 're gonna make some sort of alternate Manhattan appear ? It 's already there , General Hames . Dr. Warren . At all times , right in front of our eyes . We just can 't see it . I 'm sure you know that the original purpose for the so-called observation deck of The Empire State Building was to be a docking station ... for zeppers of course . Gentlemen , you are looking through a window ... into another world . Walter , what are you doing here ? You left me no choice . You wouldn 't answer your telephone , return my messages . I tried to communicate . I need time , okay ? I don 't even know ... how to begin to work this out . I think I do . Please , Olivia , I need to explain . And if you wouldn 't mind , I could use a sip of something , myself . Have you told Agent Broyles ? No . But to be honest , that doesn 't mean that I won 't . I always knew that one day I 'd have to pay the price for my deception . Well , we 're not really sure what the cost is yet , are we ? No , I suppose not . I invented this after William and I learned that we had doubles on the other side . Or maybe it was before . I can 't remember . It 's a window to the other universe . I was a different man then . I was going to change the world . But you see , after Peter became sick , none of that seemed to matter anymore . The illness was genetic . Savage . Wasting . I tried everything . There was simply no hope . At least ... not on this side . But over there ... They 're more technologically advanced . If the alternate Peter was also sick over there , then wouldn 't his father be equally motivated to find a cure ? He was . God help me ... He was . Any progress ? He 's synthesizing a new compound now . He 's using cobalt and magnesium . Any idea yet how he 's selecting the filtering compounds ? Random , I think . Chance , fate , luck of the draw . I 've given him a name , Carla . - Hmm ? - Walternate . This is it . This should be the reaction . No cure . Perhaps with a higher iodine purification . - Walter Bishop . - Walter ? Elizabeth . - Is he ... - Yeah , no , he 's ... he 's fine . He 's ... he 's all right right now . But , um ... What ? I think you should come home now , Walter . I think it 's time you came home . Okay . Okay . He looks worse . Keeps asking for you . It 's not like before . What is it like ? It 's different . He keeps saying he wants to talk to you . He says he 's worried he won 't be able to . I just can 't bear it when you 're not here . You know what I 'm doing . You know where I am 24 hours a day , 7 days a week . Yes . I won 't give up , Elizabeth . I can do this . I need you not to doubt me . You 're supposed to get some rest , great son . - Dad ? - Mm ? I 've almost got it . Ooh . Let me show you . Now ... Slowly ... Watch ... one finger at a time . You show me . Very good . I want you to have it , my lucky silver dollar , if I die . Peter ... It 's okay . I 'm not scared . Nothing 's going to happen to you . I promise . You 're going to be just fine . Okay ? Now get some rest . Okay . Will you wake me for dinner ? I don 't wanna miss it . You 're not gonna miss anything . You know how much William wanted to be here . But with the meetings in Berlin ... I don 't need to tell you how important they are . For both of you . He wanted me to make sure that you know how terrible he feels . Yes . I understand . I 'm glad you came . We didn 't give him a good life . We didn 't . He ... he ... He practically never got out of the house . He was always too sick . He didn 't go to a proper school . He didn 't have any proper friends . He ... he had no family but us . We kept him so well , we never let anyone else get to know him . We did the best we could . We dealt with what we were given . He knew he was loved . Didn 't he ? Walter , what 's wrong ? You 're cold . Have you been outside ? Come with me . Walter , what is this ? How 's this possible ? How are you doing this ? What I 've been working on , Elizabeth , it 's a window to another universe . Like ours , but different . Please . Please turn it back on again . Please turn it on . I want to see him again ! Elizabeth , I am telling you this because I want you to know that somewhere Peter will grow up , somewhere he will lead a proper life , somewhere he will be happy , but just not here . And we must take comfort in this . And we must begin to move on . The compounds you 're using for the cure ... not random at all . You are very ... very smart . Yes ! You did it ! By god , you did it ! No . No , no , you ... You had it , the cure . All you have to do is stabilize the compound , and you can save him . You can save him . Their theories are fascinating . They are not theories . They are entertainment . I have made ... a mistake . So I 've heard . What were you doing in the lab ? Dr. Bishop was on the verge of developing a cure for the boy . It was an important moment he discovered me . There was no other way to witness the moment . You have changed the future . You have created a new set of probabilities . But you must agree the moment was significant . The boy is significant . You need to take action to restore balance . How ? You will have an opportunity to fix this . Walter ? Dr. Warren . Have you been here all night ? I 've been working . Working on what ? - This . - What is this ? Walternate found a cure . He found a cure for Peter . And ... and it works , Carla . It 's not too late . I can save him . Walter , Peter is dead . I know . Of course I know that ! I 'm not talking about my Peter . I 'm talking about the other Peter , The one on the other side . He missed it . The other Walter . He ... he missed it and , you know ... It was right there in front of him , And ... and he didn 't see it . - He was distracted by the man . - What man ? The man in the lab . He was distracted . And ... and when he returned , the positive result had failed , and so he moved on . Maybe he 'll realize what he missed , and he 'll go back . Carla , he is just ... like ... me . I wouldn 't look back , and neither will he . He didn 't see the compound ... But I did . And I 've reproduced it . It just needed ... Minor modification . And without this , Peter will die . He 'll die all over again . Which is why I have to go over there . What ? The casimir effect should produce a thinner , more porous region of space-time . I only need to affect the area for long enough to cross over to the other side with a vial of the cure . And ... and then , of course , recreate the effect to cross back again . Walter , you 're trying to create a wormhole into another universe ? Yes ! I think I just said that . Where 's my map ? When I looked into his room on the other side , I saw that his mother had already packed his suitcase for our lake house , just like we do every year at this time . That 's where we need to find a location to set up . Walter , I 'm sorry , but you can 't . Yes . Yes , I think I can . No , Walter , I mean you can 't . Shattering the wall between universes would rupture the fundamental constants of nature . It 's a theory . We don 't know that to be true . It 's a good theory . It is why we have been lying to the military , telling them it 's impossible . Walter , there has to be a line somewhere . There has to be a line we can 't cross . I always considered you as a scientist , Dr. Warren ... Despite your personal needs for religious claptrap . I see I was wrong . " I am become death , destroyer of worlds . " Don 't you quote Oppenheimer to me . Knowledge cannot be pursued without morality . You sound like a pious sanctimonious southern preacher ! I may go to church every sunday , Walter , but I also have three degrees in theoretical physics , And I am telling you you cannot do this . We both know the amount of energy required to create a portal will forever ruin both universes . For the sake of one life , you will destroy the world . Some things are not ours to tamper with . Some things are god 's . My son is dying , Dr. Warren . I will not allow that to happen again . There 's only room for one god in this lab , and it 's not yours . The lake . It 's perfect . The water will absorb the excess energy . And I won 't be needing your assistance any further today , Dr. Warren . - Walter ... - That will be all . Walter 's always been like that . He often goes off on flights of fancy . But even if he was serious , The design itself is decades beyond anything we could imagine . No . You don 't understand . He already has the design . He 's building it . Oh . Yes . Dr. Bell 's room , please . Here ... Here we do . See you 've changed your mind , Carla . Good . I 'm sorry , Walter . You disappoint me , Dr. Warren . Go home , Nina . There 's work to be done here . Walter , don 't do this . Oh , I 'll be there and back before you know it . That 's not the point . We both know that there 's more to it than that . Don 't mean to say that creating a doorway between universes is trivial . I 'm simply suggesting that ... Now if William were here ... William were here ? He 'd be applauding . Well , that 's not true . No ? Then why isn 't he here ? I ... the funding , his schedule . Oh , he 's in Europe chasing funding ? Too busy to come and stop me from destroying the universe ? How many times have you rang him today ? Once ? 20 ? How many times has he returned your call ? You know how many times that William has encouraged me to take this very risk ? To expedite our espionage program ? " Why simply take a peek into the other universe , Walter , when you can go there ? " So up till now , he couldn 't make me find a way to try to get there until I had to find a way . No , I don 't believe that . No , no , you wouldn 't , because you don 't understand him . Like everyone else , you 're blinded by the charming manner , the air of intelligence , the whole damn show . All William Bell ever cared about was finding a way to increase the power and the wealth and the legend of William Bell . Walter , regardless of what William wants , or who he is , I know why you 're doing this . I understand . You know how much Peter meant to me , and how difficult it will be for me to admit that he 's gone . But ... this . This isn 't the answer . No . I won 't let him die again . No ! Walter ! I won 't let you do it ! Walter ! Oh ! Nina ! Help me ! Oh , no . Oh , no . Hey . You 're supposed to be getting some rest . Look . I 've almost got it . Okay , let 's take a look . Here , let 's see , okay . It 's like this . Okay , slowly . One finger at a time . Okay ? Slowly . Two ... Three . Good job . Okay . All right , love . Now sleep , okay ? Good night , sweetheart . Mom ? Mm-hmm ? I want you to have it . What , darling ? My lucky silver dollar . Okay . I want you to have it if I die . Sweetheart , well ... It 's okay . I 'm not scared . Listen . Nothing is going to happen to you . I promise . You 're gonna be fine . You just need to get some rest now , okay ? Okay . All right . Okay , my love . Dad ? Hello , son . Dad ? Are you all right ? Yes . Baby , who you talking to ? Walter ? I ... what are you doing here ? I thought you were working late at Cambridge . I , uh ... Walter , what are you wearing ? Where did you get that coat ? I think I found a cure . What ? I think I found it , a cure for him . Are you certain ? Yes , I believe so . I 'll need to take him back to Cambridge to the lab . Now . Yes . Yeah , of course . Right , Peter , darling , get up . I 'm going to get you dressed . Darling , let 's get you out of this . Okay . Good boy . Okay , let 's ... There 's a good chap . All right . Darling , we just have to go to daddy 's work . - Elizabeth ? - Mm ... hmm ? May I have a word , please ? Yeah , of course . Put the gloves on . What is it ? I think you should stay here . What ? The cure , there 's still testing to be done , and it could take all night to find the correct dosage . Well , I can pack a bag . No . No , you haven 't slept in weeks . If it works , there could be many days and weeks of recuperation . Peter will need you . He 'll need you to be strong . - Walter ... - No . I 'm fine . Please , Liz . I need you not to doubt me . Okay . Okay . Oh , god , he 's burning up . We should leave . You take this for luck . I love you very much . I love you too , Mom . I 'm going to be waiting for you right here . Okay ? Okay , go on . Gloves . Bring him back to me . I promise . Are you warm enough ? I 'm cold . Me too . Just a little farther . Where are we going ? Why aren 't we taking the car ? We can 't get where we 're going in a car . You 're not my father , are you ? Of course I am . Who else would I be ? I 'm going to make you all better . Hold on tight , son . We did it . Is he okay ? Who are you ? You 're the man I saw ... in the lab ... on the other side . Your friend and the one who was injured , they left to seek medical attention . He won 't live much longer . You must fix him . Your lab is six miles from here . Can you drive ? Think so . Why ... Why did you save us ? The boy is important . He has to live . I just got off with the hospital . Dr. Bell called in a team of specialists . He has some thoughts on Nina 's arm . Thank you for coming in to help with Peter , after all that happened . Of course , Walter . He looks better . Yes . He 's getting his color back . Seems to be working . You 're going to return him . Yes . Once he 's stabilized . Good . I 'd like to go now . Of course . Thank you . Walter ? Love , you didn 't come home last night . I was worried about you . I thought ... How ? He was dying , Elizabeth . This is the boy I showed you , the other Peter . It was the only way I could save him . Oh . Oh , god . Oh , my baby . Oh , my baby . Elizabeth , don 't . He 's not ours . I have to take him back . And I realized at that moment that despite what I 'd promised , what I fully intended to do ... that I could never take Peter back . The way she looked at him , I saw in her what I feared most in myself when I saw him ... That I couldn 't lose him again . It was the first hole , Olivia . The first breach . The first crack in a pattern of cracks , spaces between the worlds . And it 's my fault . You can 't imagine what it 's like to lose a child .

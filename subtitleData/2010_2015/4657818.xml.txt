 original uploader ~ Sentinel ~ PROMETHEUS Get Charlie . Doctor Holloway ! Charlie ! What ? ! - Come quick ! maybe older . You got to be kidding me . It 's the same configuration . by a millennium . I think they want us to come and find them . What happened to that man ? - He died . Why aren 't you helping him ? They don 't want my help . Their God is different than ours . Why did he die ? Sooner or later everyone does . - Like mommy ? Like mommy . Where do they go ? Everyone has their own word . Paradise ... it 's someplace beautiful . How do you know it 's beautiful ? Cos that 's what I choose to believe . What do you believe darling ? David . Transmitting message . No response . Whilst this manner of articulation is attested indeed in the it is phonemic in the ancestral form dating back five millennium or more . Now let 's attempt Schleicher 's Fable . Repeat after me : Perfect . sir . - Thank you . You 'll do that once too often . It 's only flesh and blood . you 're a philosopher . And you 're balmy ! it hurts ! what 's the trick then ? is not minding that it hurts . is not minding that it hurts . Attention ! Destination threshold . Attention ! Destination threshold . Robe . How long ? 15 minutes ... ma 'am ? everyone 's fine . then wake them up . Try to relax Dr. Shaw . My name is David . as a result of stasis . All that is perfectly normal . we 're here baby . drink plenty of fluids . Hydration aids muscle mass . What the hell is that ? need a holiday to show time is still moving . Mission briefing is about to start captain . You might want to make your way down . I haven 't had a breakfast yet . nice to meet you . I 've been asleep two years . I ain 't here to be your friend . you got that ? OK . I bet a hundred credits it 's a terraforming survey . you 're on . Ellie . - Trying to keep my feet on the ground . I know you are . - Good morning . it 's nice to see you again . I am Meredith Vickers and it 's my job to make sure you do yours . on with the show . building better worlds . Hello friends . My name is Peter Weyland . I am your employer . 2091 . you have reached your destination . And I am long dead . May I rest in peace . his name is David . He is the closest thing to a son I will ever have . and he will never die . for that would require the one thing that David will never have . A soul . I have spent my entire lifetime contemplating these questions . Where do we come from ? What is our purpose ? What happens when you die ? And I have finally found two people who have convinced me they are on the verge of answering them . if you would please stand . As far as you 're concerned they are both in charge . for that he was cast from Olympus . the time has finally come for his return . please . Floor is yours . Ok ... Never had to follow a ghost before . let me show why you guys are here . from all over the Earth . and Mesopotamian . This one here is our most recent discovery . It 's a 35.000 year old cave painting from the Isle of Skye in Scotland . and yet ... The same pictogram showing men worshiping giant beings pointing to the stars was discovered at every last one of them . was so far from earth that there 's no way that these primitive ancient civilizations could have possibly known about . has a sun . A lot like ours . there seems to be a planet . Just one planet with a moon capable of sustaining life . And we arrived there this morning . is that right ? No . - Yes . an invitation . - From whom ? We called them engineers . - Engineers ? Do you mind telling us what they engineered ? They engineered us . Bullshit . Do you have anything to back that up ? look if you 're willing to discount 3 centuries of Darwinism that 's ... But how do you know ? - I don 't . But it 's what I choose to believe . Doctors ? before the adventure begins . with its own self-contained life support . anything miss Vickers would need to survive hostile environment . I like to minimize risk . why don 't you make the doctors a drink ? up . it 's a Pauling med-pod . They only made a dozen of these . - Miss Shaw ! Please verbally state the nature of your injury . Please don 't touch that . It 's a very expensive piece of machinery . what do you need it for ? I think there might be some confusion about our relationship . but I 'm fairly certain your " engineers " are nothing but scribblings of savages living in dirty little caves . and you do find these beings down there . You won 't engage them . you will do nothing but report it back to me . is there an agenda that you 're not telling us about ? My company paid a trillion dollars to find this place and to bring you here . agenda . But you didn 't . And that makes you an employee . why did you even bring us here ? Weyland was a superstitious man . He wanted a true believer on board . Cheers . no . Maybe they didn 't understand it . David ? to their roots . provided your thesis is correct . that 's good . doctor . let 's take her down . - Roger that . - Yes captain . How are we doing ? - Great . this is the captain . Brace for entry . - Yes captain . That means you too Vickers . What is the atmosphere ? traces of unknown gas . now that 's weather . - Just like home . Only if you 're breathing through an exhaust pipe . you 're dead . 52.000 . Makes Everest look like a baby brother . take us round . We will use that as our point of entry . Terrain data rising up . We 've got a couple of hard spots . Could be metal . no heat source . - Nobody 's home . There 's nothing in the desert . No man needs nothing . What was that ? - Just something from a film I like . Let 's go through that gateway . Reduce air speed by 100 knots . nice and slow . Keep her steady boys . - There . What are you doing ? Doctor Holloway why don 't you take a seat ? ! Right there . God does not build in straight lines . do you think you can put us down there ? starboard 90 degrees . port bow . Engage landing sequence . Switch to manual . yeah . 4 ... easy does it . would you please tell the survey team to suit up ? And meet us in the air lock . - There 's only 6 hours left of daylight . and I want to open my presents . you 're coming with us . - I 'd be delighted . what 's that for ? Expedition security . My job is to make sure everybody 's nice and safe . no weapons . Alright then . Good luck with that . why are wearing a suite ? remember ? why wear a suite ? I was designed like this because you people are more comfortable interacting with your own kind . it would defeat the purpose . Making you guys pretty close ? - Not to close I hope . This is just one small step for mankind . Seriously ? Come on ! You ready to do this ? ! I know you are . alright ? it 's hollow . are you seeing this ? we see you . Are you ready ? - Yeah . - Let 's do it . After you . - After you . we 're going in . Copy that . some kind of a corridor . I want the whole interior . my pups . we are now mapping . Copy that . I 'll be damned . you got a reading ? - Yeah . this way . Look at this . Oh Charlie ... sunlight 's heating the water . look at the CO2 levels . and in here there 's nothing . It 's breathable . don 't be an idiot . David ? actually . don 't do ... I 'm not wearing this thing anymore . do not remove your head gear . You crazy bastard . we are taking our helmets off . switching feeds . pay up . Pay what ? - What do you mean " pay what " ? Something 's manufacturing breathable air down there . the bet was why we came here . then I 'd pay put it towards how about that ? It 's minus 12 in here . So why is this water not frozen ? Maybe it 's martian piss . Mr. Biology ? whatever it is it sure is clean . Impressive . What was that ? - David ? David ? ! David ? ! Ellie ! What the hell was that ? - Aren 't you glad we didn 't bring any weapons ? Whose idea was that ? ! - Keep up ! Where did he go ? There it is . Charlie we found them . - What do you mean " them " ? It is them Ellie . and he 's been decapitated by it . Son of a bitch . They were right . Did you want them to be wrong ? please tell me you can read that . Perhaps . I 'm out of here . where are you going ? What ? I love rocks . but what you do seem to care about is gigantic dead bodies I don 't really have anything to contribute in the gigantic dead body arena ! if you don 't mind . Anyone want to join me ? You staying ? ship very good . Congratulations on meeting your maker . - Thank you . Pull yourself together man . I thought you were the crazy one . Do you have the carbon reader ? Thank you . How long has it been dead ? give or take . What are you doing David ? I 'm attempting to open the door . we don 't know what 's on the other side . sorry . it 's the head . An amazing state of preservation . We 'll take it in . Remarkably human . Beautiful painting . It 's a mural . don 't touch it . - Sorry . don 't touch anything . It 's sweating . Organic . Charlie the murals are changing . I think we 've averted the atmosphere in the room . do you copy ? help me bag the head . Boss ? - What you got ? silica and this is not good . - I see it . Ground crew this is Janek . Need you to hustle back right now . do you copy ? I got 200 km winds of airborne silica and enough static to fry your suit . but we need more time here . I 'll be closing the outer doors in 15 minutes . I sincerely hope you can make it . we must leave now ! This is just another tomb . David ? Let 's go ! we are leaving ! they 've already taken off . let 's go . you 're running out of time . Come on . Drive faster ! the head ! Ellie stop ! What are you doing ? ! Shit Ellie hold on ! Goddamn it . - Close it ! Got it . Decontamination at level 3 . What was that Ellie ? not to mention almost killing yourself ! thank you David . My pleasure . but where is Millburn and Fifield ? Aren 't they back yet ? Kick them up for me . it all looks the same to me . listen up . there ain 't no safe way to come get you . so get your helmets on and stay warm . Till the storm passes . can you get a message to the scientist and that zealot girlfriend of his ? Know what they 're paying me by ? - No . I think we got it . Tell them I said ... themselves . Copy ? - Copy that . keep your heads down and we 'll come get you in the morning . no contagion present . - David . So are they all dead ? What ? Who ? - Your engineers . we just got here . Scan . Do you even care if they 're all dead ? - Weyland cared . have a look at this . That 's not an exoskeleton . - No . - I think it 's a helmet . Let 's see if we can lift it up . - Should be able to pry this open . David . Careful . - Like so . What is that on its head ? - It looks like neo cells . In a state of ... - Change . - Yes . Changing into what ? Can you run a stim line into Locus Coeruleus ? I think we can trick the nervous system into thinking it 's still alive . 30 amps . - OK . - No more . Let me make an incision . - OK . 40 . 40 up . Did you see that ? See ? Go up another 10 . up 10 . down 10 . down . stop it ! now ! Mortal after all . Ford take a sample . Let 's have a look . I will take care of it . I 'm sorry . slightly premature . Of course sir . Miss Vickers ? What did he say David ? - I don 't think he 'd want me to tell you . that 's confidential . I will find the cord that makes you run and I will cut it . What did he say ? He said : " Try harder " . ma 'am ? Genetic view . - OK . - Let 's have a look at its DNA . Isolate the strand . Compare it to the gene sample . Overlay . - Processing . Processing . DNA match . Oh my God ... it 's everything . What killed them ? Big things have small beginnings . Am I interrupting ? Thought you might be running low . but I 'm afraid it would be wasted on me . I almost forgot you 're not a real boy . Dr. Holloway . don 't you ? Your question depends on the understanding what you hope to achieve by coming here . to get answers . Why they even made us in the first place . Why do you think your people made me ? We made you cos we could . to hear the same thing from your creator ? I guess it 's a good thing you can 't be disappointed . Yes . It 's wonderful actually . May I ask you something ? to get what you came all this way for ? Your answers ? What would you be wiling to do ? - Anything and everything . I 'd imagine . pal . Good health . It 's those things . Are they real ? Of course they 're real . look how up they are . Looks like they were running from something . OK ? almost like its exploded . It 's like a scene out of some sort of holocaust painting . right ? this is Millburn . why ? - I just got a ping . a ping ? it 's not dead . It 's reading life form . What do you mean a " life form " ? - Is it moving ? I don 't think so . you wouldn 't be talking about bloody ping . the signal 's been coming in sporadicly since the storm hit . That 's not good to us down here captain ! Is it moving ? Are these things moving ? it just disappeared actually . a glitch " ? sleep tight . what do you mean " a glitch " ? Millburn wait ! one click west ? do we ? - Shit no . Where are we going to go ? - East . what the fuck ? ! we 're still attempting to identify what caused the head to combust . was there an outbreak here ? ma 'am ? - I have something important to tell you . What is that ? - This is a rose that I had frozen with the champagne . I was gonna give it to you when we found what we came for . this is ... The most significant discovery in the history of mankind . I know . but ... I wanted to talk to them . Don 't you want to know why they came ? Why they abandoned us ? I just want answers baby . We were right Charlie . I have proof . Look . Their genetic material predates ours . We come from them . - Are you kidding me ? - No . OK . I guess you can take your father 's cross off now . Why would I want to do that ? Because they made us . - And who made them ? we 'll never know . But here 's what we do know . There is nothing special about the creation of life . right ? I can 't . I can 't create life . What does that say about me ? I didn 't mean ... I wasn 't talking about ... Children ? - Us . you are the most special person I have ever met in my life . And I love you . No . How much longer is this gonna take ? I 'm just the captain . by the way . I 'll have you know that this " thing " once belonged to Steven Stills . Am I supposed to know who that is ? You know ... you really don 't have to pretend to be interested in the pyramid scanner . I 'm trying to get laid " . right ? it wouldn 't make sense why I 'd find myself half a billion miles from would it ? Hey Vickers ! I was wondering ... Are you a robot ? ten minutes . what 's with this black stuff ? Gazpacho . Is that tobacco ? Is that tobacco in your respirator ? sure . Tobacco . On behalf of scientists everywhere I am really . Millburn ? - Yeah ? - Do you see this thing ? What do you think this thing was ? Some kind of a god ? Something they worshiped ? just stay calm . I can handle this . Hey baby . we have a elongated reptile type creature . with transparent skin . It 's beautiful . we have 2 ! Look at you . Look at you baby . what is it ? OK ? - What 's there to be calm about ? she is beautiful . She ? What the hell makes you think that 's female ? look . She 's mesmerized . Come here . it 's OK . Hey baby . OK ? ! Get it off man ! OK ? ! I ain 't touching that ! It 's getting tighter . - I ain 't touching that ! Don 't want to touch it ! Touch the thing man ! For God 's sake ... God ! You 're making it worse ! It 's tightening ! It 's breaking my arm ! Cut it off ! Cut if off ! Oh my God ! It 's in my suit ! you up ? what 's up ? to see if we can rustle them up . any idea where they are ? Last time they radioed in they were just outside where you found your head . we 're coming . come on . Alright boss . did you fix that glitch ? it 's got to be in the hardware . captain ? - One of them probes pops up every hour or so for couple of seconds and then it 's gone . if you 'd like . Knock yourself out . doctor . Fifield ? ! Millburn ? ! come on down . are you alone ? Yes miss Vickers . - Up link your feed to my room . Copy . You son of a bitch . He cut me off . What is this ? Charlie ? - I just tripped . you 're sick . - I 'm OK baby . Fifield ? Millburn ? I wouldn 't touch that if I were you . Doctor Shaw ? - Yes ? Do you have any idea oozing out of these vases ? they weren 't like this last time we were here . Captain ! - What ? Who is that ? Which one ? - Who is it ? - It 's Millburn . honey ? Charlie what 's wrong ? OK ? what do you see ? look at me and tell me what you see . get over here . Janek ! We have to go now ! - What do you see baby ? he 's not good ! I see a movement in his esophagus . come over and help me ! Ford get over here ! What 's happening over there ? ! Help me with him ! - I 'm ok ... I 'm gonna get you out of here . Prometheus come in ! - I 'm OK . Get him up ! come in ! Is anyone there ? This is Vickers . - I need a medical team standing by the air lock . Full quarantine failsafe . Holloway is sick . Sick with what ? - Just do it . No sitting out . He don 't look too good . - Did he catch something in there ? We had our helmets off ... make sure that back door is open . aye captain . I 'm so sorry . Please ! why is that door not open ? ! that is an order ! Get that goddamn door open ! come on ! this is Janek open that back door right now ! - Hold that door ! Do you copy ? Goddamn it open that door that is an order ! Open it ! What the hell is this ? - He 's not coming on board . that 's why he 's not coming on my ship ! Don 't kill him ! we can still help him ! now ! I won 't leave him ! - Then stay ! put him on a med-pod ! Ellie . - Vickers ! What are you doing ? - I love you baby . - No ! stay back ! - Do it . - Stay back ! Do it . My deepest condolences . it may be contaminated . we were all exposed . We need to run blood work on everyone who set foot in the pyramid . Yes of course . I understand how inappropriate this is . Given the circumstances . as you ordered quarantine fail safes it 's my responsibility to ask . Have you and Dr. Holloway had any intimate contact recently ? I just want to be as thorough as possible . my ... You 're pregnant . What ? three months . - Well that 's impossible . I can 't be pregnant . - Did you have intercourse with Dr. Holloway ? but ten hours ago . There 's no bloody way I 'm three months pregnant . it 's not exactly a traditional fetus . I want to see it . - Don 't think that 's a good idea . I want to see it . Now doctor ... I want to see it . I want it out of me . - I 'm afraid we don 't have personnel to perform the procedure like that . Our best option ... - I want it out . get it out of me . Get it out of me ! Please ... Must be very painful . let me give you something . That 's it to bring you back to cryo-deck . Must feel like your God abandoned you . - What ? after your father died under such similar circumstances . What was it that killed him ? Ebola ? How do you know that ? I watched your dreams . Dr. Shaw ? We 're here to put you in an anti-contamination suit . go to bed-e-byes . Dr. Shaw ? prepare her . Emergency procedure initiated . Please verbally state the nature of your injury . I need caesarean ! this med-pod is calibrated for male patients only . It does not have the procedure you have requested . Please seek medical assistance ... abdominal ... foreign body ... Initiate . Surgical procedure beginning . Running diagnostics . Oh come on ! Get it out ! Come on ! Please ! Oh God ! Initiating anesthetics . Commence surgical procedure . oh my God ! Come on ! this is the captain . - Yes captain ? Can you see what I 'm seeing ? Fifield 's monitor just popped up . What ? Where ? it 's right outside the goddamn ship . come on in . Fifield ? Wait a second ... take a look at this . Fifield ? What the hell is going on down there ? ! come on ! Take him out ! You ready Chance ? ! - Yes . You 've been asleep ... why ? I have a few days of life left in me . till I was sure that you could deliver what you promised . nice and clean . Haven 't you told him they 're all gone ? Dr. Shaw . One of them is still alive . We 're on our way to see him now . What ? - Turn me round . You convinced me ... If these things made us ... Then surely they could save us . My stick . anyway . - Save you ? From what ? stand me up . this place isn 't what we thought it was ... They aren 't what we thought they were . we were so wrong . Dr. Holloway is dead . now ? We 're so close to answering the most meaningful questions ever asked by mankind . How can you leave without knowing what they are ? Shaw ? Ok ... Come in . Where the hell are you going doc ? You know what this place is ? this ain 't their home . maybe even military . They put it out here in the middle of nowhere because they 're not stupid enough to make weapons of mass destruction on their own doorstep . That 's what all that shit is in those vases . the end . It 's time for us to go home . One of them is still alive . Don 't you want to know what they have to say ? I don 't care . all you do is fly this ship . That 's right . captain . why are you here ? How about this . can 't let it happen . to see that it doesn 't . captain . You came after all . - Thought you wanted me to . After all your vigorous attempts to stop me I 'm just surprised to see you . leave us alone . - Yes sir . you 're going to die . Very negative way of looking at things . Exactly why you should have stayed at home . arguing over who is in charge while you go look for some miracle on some godforsaken rock in the middle of space ? A king has his reign and then he dies . It 's inevitable . That is a natural order of things . Anything else ? No . Father . That 's it . I didn 't think you had it in you . poor choice of words . Elizabeth . What happens when Weyland is not around to program you any more ? I suppose I 'll be free . - You want that ? What ? Not a concept I 'm familiar with . doesn 't everyone want their parents dead ? I didn 't . I 'm pleased you could join us . You can take your helmet off if you 'd like sir . - Why ? The air is perfectly breathable . - You sure ? - Positive . we still don 't know how Holloway got infected . If it 's in the air ... - It 's not . How do you know that ? - Smells fine to me . Shall we ? - Please . The bridge is just up ahead . - What is this ? It 's a cargo hold . are you seeing this ? How many is there Shaw ? - Thousands . What the hell ? give me those schematics . Putting it on the table now . bring it up . Bringing it up captain . Enlarge that . Rotate it . That is a ship . Jesus Christ . It 's a goddamn ship . no doubt . would impress I trust . So they were traveling somewhere ? I have managed to work out the broad strokes . It 's fairly evident they were in the process of leaving . Before things went apart . Leaving to go where ? Earth . - Why ? one must first destroy . David ? - This way sir . Sure he 's alive ? Absolutely . And you can speak to him ? - I believe I can . I 'm alright ! Speak to him David . just like he asked . - Ask him where they 're from . enough . why ? Shaw enough ! For God 's sake shut her up . what did we do wrong ? ! Why do you hate us ? ! tell him why I came . No ! There 's nothing ... I know . Mr. Weyland . Time to go home . take us home . Hey captain ... - What in the hell was that ? come in ! listen to me ! This ship is taking off ! - What ? - What the hell is she talking about ? You can 't let it leave ! You have to stop it ! we 're going home . there won 't be any home to go back to . it 's headed for Earth . I know that . let 's go ! please . I told you to get the ship going . warm up the ion propulsion . - What the hell are you talking about ? burning the ion in the inner atmosphere ... that is exactly the point . I 'm telling you to take us home ! Vickers I 'm going to eject your life support that 's 2 years of life . You want it or do you want to stay with me ? You have 40 seconds to get to the escape pod . I can handle this myself . Feel free to join miss Vickers . you 're a shit pilot and you 're going to need all the help you can get . you 're wrong . Why don 't you pay me on the other side ? only got one shot at this . Life boat 's away . 20 seconds to evacuate . Countdown initiated . - Ion propulsion is online . Come on ! let 's do it ! Impact imminent ! - Hands on ! No ! Oh God ... you have 2 minutes of oxygen remaining .. you have 30 seconds of oxygen remaining .. Airlock sealed . Oxygen levels now stabilizing . are you there ? This is David . I 'm here . immediately . He 's coming for you . - Who 's coming ? Airlock breach ! Die ! I am so sorry ... Oh God ... I can 't do it . I can 't do it anymore . Elizabeth ? Are you there ? can you hear me ? Yes . Yes I can hear you . I was afraid you were dead . You have no idea what afraid is . I know we 've had our differences . I need to ask you for your help . Why in hell would I help you ? you will never leave this place . Neither one of us is leaving this place . It 's not the only ship . There are many others . I can operate them . Dr. Shaw ? Dr. Shaw ! Over here ! Where 's my cross ? The pouch in my utility belt . don 't you ? You said you could understand the navigation . Use their maps . Yes of course . finding a path to Earth should be relatively straightforward . I don 't want to go back to where we came from . I want to go where they came from . You think you can do that David ? I believe I can . May I ask what you hope to achieve by going there ? then they tried to kill us . They changed their minds . I deserve to know why . The answer is irrelevant . Does it matter why they changed their minds ? yes it does . I don 't understand . - Well ... I guess that 's because I am human being . And you are a robot . I 'm sorry . - It 's quite alright . Final report of the vessel Prometheus . The ship and her entire crew are gone . make no attempt to come to its point of origin . and I 'm leaving it behind . 2094 . last survivor of the Prometheus . And I am still searching .

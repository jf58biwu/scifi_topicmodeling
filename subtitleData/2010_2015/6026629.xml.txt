 Yeah , don 't get up . I got it , bro . Damn Finn , this must be your best one yet . How long have you been working on this ? For what like ... two , three weeks ? Fuck Off . Man , I don 't go to the bar and complain when it takes you 10 minutes to make a martini . I 'm perfectly happy with where I 'm at . I just hit a litte creative block . That 's all . Hello ? Oh hi , Mrs. Anderson . Why yes , the building manager is right here . Oh , I 'm sure he 'd be delighted to come over and fix your toilet . Yeah , he 's giving me the thumbs-up right now . He 'll be over in a second . You were saying something , right ? About you being perfectly happy with where you 're at in life ? Well he said he was thinking of going to art school . And I said , aha ! What a coincidence ! Our building manager used to be a painter . When you 're 18 everybody want to be an artist . - Where did you get that ? - Garage Sale . So weird . I 'm seeing .. I 'm seeing .. sea shells . Outlaw . Rambling Rose . Crabapple ! - Crabs live in the fucking ocean , right ? - Yes , they do . Crabapple , I 'm betting on Crabapple . Hello , my lost boys . - New sweater . - New for me , it 's a thrift store find . Do you like it ? Oh , uh , I had a little left over , so I got these for you , babe . It 's the right kind . Camel hair , right ? Thank you . Did you get a new journal , or .. ? Oh , I knew how much you wanted them , so I couldn 't resist . . OK , I 'm gonna go start dinner . Do you guys want your favorite ? Lasagna ? Need some help ? Hello Big Joe , yes I do . Thank you . Come on , come on , that 's it , come on , you got this . Keep fucking running , let 's go . - What 's up ? - Hey .. Big Ben . It 's Joe . Crabapple , crabapple . Come on you little bastard . Run ! Come on . Run ! Come on . Fuck , man ! Chill out . Hey Finn , the landlord called . Mr. Bezzerides rent is late . Maybe he fell and he can 't get up . He 's been late before . - The man across the way ? - Yeah I noticed a couple of parking tickets on his car . I guess he 's got a couple parking tickets on his car . So maybe we should check on him . And I also invited Big Joe to stop by the party . OK , but I hope he doesn 't wear that tacky rent-a-cop uniform . I thought we were just inviting close friends . Well Big Joe is really cool . And he 's helped me with chairs . He 's standing here . Right now . Do not worry , I own other outfits . I 'm sorry . I just gonna go check on Mr. Bezzerides . Hey Mr. Bezzerides , are you home ? Everyone 's kinda woried about you . So I 'm gonna go ahead and come inside , OK ? - It was a sure thing . - No it obviously wasn 't a sure thing . He lost , Jasper . No , he was a sure thing . Up until the moment he lost . That makes zero sense . What the fuck ! These are shots of our living room . Mr. Bezzerides is a peeping Tom . Yeah , I thought that too , but why take photos of our empty living room ? Looks like he 's saved the best ones for his private collection . What is this thing ? I think it 's a camera . See ? You think he got enough film ? What ? When did we knock over the coat rack ? Maybe it was that night we played drunk charades . - Do you remember ? - No , he doesn 't remember . He passed out on the couch . Well , I guess this explains the green light we see over here sometimes . Yeah , but why is thing bolted to the floor ? I don 't know , but I don 't like it . I don 't like the sound it 's making either . Or how about the half naked photos of me on the wall ? That 's the one thing I do like about this situation . I knew something wasn 't right about that old man . Hi Mr Kindle , this is Finn from Sycamore Apartments . I 'm calling you back about Mr Bezzerides . If I can please ring me when you get a chance , that would be great.Thank you . - What did the landlord say ? - I just left a voice mail . I 'm off to work . I counted the cookies so if any go missing ... - ... there will be murder in this apartment . - I 'll guard them . And who 's gonna guard them from you ? It 's a perfect match . It 's gotta be a coincidence . - Maybe or ... - Or what ? The camera took a picture ahead of time ? Just give me a break . I mean just look at it . The placement of everything .. The canvas .. Your canvas has looked like that for months . No way . This was last Wednesday . Remember you broke the mug with your forearm . Oh yeah , right . Thursday . Friday we went to the movies . Saturday we lost power and used candles . Sunday . Monday . That 's tonight , Tuesday . Tomorrow . Bullshit . Mr. B invented a camera that takes pictures of the future . And he only used it to look in our apartment ? Doesn 't make any sense . Maybe he was testing it . Yeah , this thing isn 't exactly portable . Well he 's a scientist , so there gotta be some sort of logs or documentation somewhere . Just start looking . Will you guys listen to yourselves . Alright come on out Mr. B. I know you 're fucking in here in the walls or something , laughing your ass off . Alright , the jig 's up , come on out , asshole . I don 't think he 's gonna answer . Why ? November 27 . Result today . Positive function . The machine continues to work perfectly . However , I 've seen something in the future that is disturbing to my core . I believe I 've seen my death . I know the cardinal rule of time and causality is that one should not attempt to change the future . But under these circumstances it seems to be a risk worth taking . If I believed in God , I would pray today that no greater harm will come from what I 'm about to do . Then what ? Nothing . It 's the last entry , a week ago today . A week ago . Seven photos . That means it was kicking it out after he disappeared . So it must be on a timer . 8 pm . Why are there so many daylight ones ? Maybe it 's only been taking ones at night for the last week . Alright , even I have to admit , this photo is a little fucking unsettling . I think I know where he might be . Christ ! What 's he keeping in here ? I do not know . The previous manager added this door years ago . Please don 't let him be in there . There is no way . If there was a dead body in here , you 'd be able to smell .. What ? Is he in there ? Oh my God ! Close it . Close It ! What happened to him ? It looked like he was burnt . Yeah , I don 't know about that . I mean did you see his suit , it was fine . It wasn 't even touched . Isn 't it obvious ? I mean you read his journal . He broke the cardinal rule . Don 't fuck with time . Jasper , please , take his hat off . It 's my thinking cap . What the hell is there to think about ? We need to call the police , guys . Hang on . That could be a big mistake . What do you mean ? I mean we just discovered a fucking time traveling camera . We need to consider the possibilities . One possibility is we 've all been dosed with lethal amounts of radiation , that ... .. you know could 've killed Mr. B. Okay , Negative Nancy , but what if we could use this thing ? How ? Remember how Mr B took a photo of himself holding that sign ? What if we put up like ... the newspaper ? We would know what happens in the future . You know , the newspaper , Jasper ? What are you thinking , arts and entertainment , or are you thinking the race results ? Well , what if ? I mean think about how much money we would make . Callie . I foretell that tonight is your last night waiting tables . And instead you can pursue writing full time . No , absolutely not . We 're calling the police . Finn , I foretell that you live the rest of your life in pathetic obscurity . And die penniless and insane . - I 'm serious , Jasper . - So am I. Does it look like the cops are here ? That people are buzzing about the charred corpse in the storage unit ? Everything looks fine . Look If we reported it , we probably wouldn 't've had the party anyway . We 'd've canceled it altogether . We can 't cancel it , It 's Dave and Sharon 's engagement party . That 's what I 'm saying . Obviously we don 't report it tonight . There is a dead fucking rotting corpse in the storage unit . You can 't smell anything , as long as we keep the door closed . - Wow . - It 's been down there a week , what 's one more day . Look , we let the party happen .. we look at tomorrow 's photo and if it shows the cops taking our testimony and shit , I 'll call them myself . I have to admit , I 'm kind of curious to see one more photo . Alright , fine , one day , but ... One day . What time is it ? 22 . Well , just in case tomorrow 's photo shows the end of the world .. I 'm gonna enjoy myself . Do you wanna dance ? And he adopts his classic glazed-over look . That son of a bitch . Guys . - I 'm a fucking genius . - Look at the painting . Holy shit ! The camera sees my work before I do . It 's incredible . I don 't have to be blocke any more . You 're up early . What time is it ? How about we start with , what year is it ? Oh , so you can write in a dead man 's journal , but I 'm not allowed to wear his hat ? This isn 't poetry Jasper . I 'm making our to-do list . If we 're really going through with this , we need to start making it look like Mr B is still around , You mean this is actually happening ? What are you talking about , bro ? It already happened . - It 's done . - Well , I mean we could just not go through with it . Actually , I think we have to . If I understand this correctly , this is how it works . The camera spits out a photo of use in the future then we go about our day making a series of decisions , that lead up to that moment . But if we deviate from those decisions then this photo never happened . Which means us - the people who saw the original photo - can 't got forward because our futures don 't exist anymore . What do you mean , can 't go forward ? I mean , are we 100 % sure that 's how he died ? No , but you really wanna test it and find out ? So it 's agreed then . All we gotta do is some photo . Okay , alright , fine . We have to do this tonight . But we 're talking about not reporting a dead body . I 'm pretty sure if anybody found out , Jasper , that that 's jail time . OK , but nobody 's gonna find out . I was over there this morning to make a list . All we have to do is : bring in his newspapers water the plants , we should probably move his car so it doesn 't get any more tickets . I found a couple of pieces of mail probably a couple of bills , so I should probably post them . - Well you seem to have everything figured out . - Dude , just relax , man . The risk is so minimal . It 's almost nonexistent . All we have to do is make sure that storage unit door stays closed . and we become rich . And you get your paintings . Come on , come on , Bobcat . Fuck yes ! Fuck yes ! Alright let 's go , it 's almost eight . Wait , do we have to be exactly as we were ? I don 't wanna change anything . - I don 't know . Is this right ? - Just smile and say goodbye to your day jobs , guys . Maybe we can just check the photo , it 's right there . Henry ? Henry , are you there ? It 's Joyce . I received your letter . Could you check in please , when you have time ? I truly hope you 're okay . Hey Finn . Hey Joe , how 's it going ? Hey , what 's going on with the old man ? I see Callie coming around here in the mornings . Yeah ? He 's sick in the hospital . We just come by to water his plants and look after the place for him . In the hospital ? Is it serious ? Yes , it 's pretty serious , I mean they 're still trying to figure out .. what he has .. - Well it 's good that you guys are looking after the place . - Yeah . I mean , we don 't mind . But better get back to it . No dude , we 're over here tonight because we 're not in the photo from last night . Well it 's not that fate decided it presumably we made decisions yesterday , that made us end up here today . Alright , my brain just kinda melted a bit . What was the original question ? The question is if you could choose something to show up in the next photo Anything . What would you choose to see ? I 'm a little ashamed about how good I felt about this dress . Back to the question . Easy . I want a pile of money so big , that I 'm fucking buried in it . You are so predictable . Me ? What about you ? We all know what you wanna see most . A rock . So you and Finn don 't have to keep living in sin . Whatever . - Did you hear that , Finn ? - What ? You 're off the hook . He 's just day dreaming about two paintings a day , instead of one . Oh I don 't know , just give a guy a second here , I need to think . Ah , I never get tired of that sound . Come on , guys . It 's not like I wanna do this . OK , then , let 's not do it . Uh , do I need to remind you about the roasted dead guy in our basement ? We gotta do what 's in the photo . Right , bro ? How the hell did this happen ? I don 't know , maybe it 's a fucking dare . Maybe we are drunk . Maybe it was an accident . That 's a fucking lip lock . We didn 't just bump into each other . Say something Finn . We should destroy that machine . What ? We can 't do that . I know . It 's too late . It doesn 't matter why we do this . For all intents and purposes it already happened . I 'm in the room , I don 't look mad or pissed . The painting 's coming out great . Yeah , the painting 's coming out great . You probably asked us to do it for inspiration , or something . We 're all friends and we just need to trust that it 's gonna be okay . Fuck ! What the fuck was that for ? That 's for kissing my girlfriend tomorrow . T minus one hour in case you were wondering . Please stop counting down as if it 's a fucking shuttle launch . Sorry . Yes , I told you Crabapple was a sure thing . I just needed a few more races . Let 's roll half the winnings in to tomorrow bets and I 'll come pick up the rest . Okay , just let me get something to write on . I thought there wasn 't a bottle in the photo . That 's because it was down here . What time is it , babe ? Finn are you okay ? Yes , it 's just , it 's this part of the painting it 's unfinished . I 'm clearly about to paint it , I just have no idea what element goes there . Okay Michelangelo but ... we have to close our eyes to match the picture . So you 're the time keeper . Yeah dude , it 's 7 : 59 , just go ahead . How long do we do it for ? Ten , fifteen seconds ? I 'll tell you when to stop , just go . I 'll be thinking about my boyfriend . Sweet . A threesome . Come here , asshole . Oh jeez , did you guys .. Hey ! Shit . - Finn . - It 's okay . Go get Jasper . - I just wanted ... - Go get Jasper ! - Finn , I 'm sorry . - Who is this ? That 's my bookie . - Ivan . - The guy you 're always talking on the phone to ? What is he doing in the apartment ? - I don 't know . - Is it normal ? Have you ever seen him in our apartment before ? No , it 's not fucking normal . - Did you tell him about the camera ? - No . - Were you planning on it ? - No , never . - Then what the fuck is he doing in the apartment ? - I said , I don 't know . OK . Is he dangerous ? Well , he takes bets from shady assholes like me . So yeah , he 's dangerous . But I don 't see Marcus here It 's his goon .. If I were in trouble , he 'd be in this photo . Wel , what if he 's sitting over here , out of view ? I was up early this morning and I heard him moving around in his room . He came out about an hour ago . Hasn 't said a word . I don 't know what those red pills are , but he 's taken at least two of them already . Can you guys shut up for a sec ? - Yeah ? - Hey Ivan , it 's Jasper . I know . - How 's it going ? - What ? Is everything okay today ? Why wouldn 't it be ? No reason . So , what do you wanna lay down today ? Uh no , no bets . I 'm just gonna cool it today . Then why did you call me ? Ah shit , I gotta go Ivan . I 'll talk to you later . So what does that mean ? It means we wait ten hours . Figure out what the hell is happening . Babe , can we talk ? Hey Ivan , what a surprise ! I was wondering why you showed up tonight , and then it occured to me . It 's probably because I called you like a paranoid fucking idiot . Hey Ivan , what a surprise ! What are you doing ? He 's gonna be here soon . You can 't leave me alone . Well , I 'm not in the picture , so send me a text message when it 's done . Well , I 'm not in the photo either , so ... maybe I should leave too . - Where are you going ? - I don 't know yet . Can I come ? You guys are unbelievable . Real friends you turned out to be . Well , we gotta do what 's in the photo . Right , bro ? Where are we going ? Nowhere . I don 't wanna bag on Jasper in case something goes wrong . Are we okay ? I got jealous . This is a .. .. very complicated situation . You 're doing your best . And I obviously am not handling it well . You got jealous ? Tell me more . So Ivan I mean , what a surprise . You said that already . Can I get you something to drink ? You know what I like about you Jasper ? You never welched on a bet . I have never had to send Marcus over here to collect . And I can appreciate that . Is that yours ? You mind if I see it ? Let me see it . That 's a nice one . That takes me back . Believe it or not , I used to have Marcus ' job . I wasn 't a bad enforcer . I had my own style . You know , I use warm-up bats . They give me a little extra extra " pah ! " . There was this one time ... God Almighty ! I was supposed to knee-cap a guy . Standard boiler plate stuff , I had done it a hundred times . Only this time , I take a swing ... I him him and bam ! and the bat breaks . And it sends a sliver of wood right into the guy 's junk . You shoulda heard him , he was screaming like a cat . I swear to God , as I heard the paramedics take him away they said that one of his testicles had swollen to the size of a grapefruit . Can you imagine that ? That pain ? Messy . Messy unfortunate work . In my position ... There is only one thing worse than a guy who can 't make good on bets . That 's a guy who never loses bets . I 'm just finally getting lucky I guess . Just lucky . You guess . Listen , there 's no fix , okay . - Is he an owner ? - No , I swear . It was just a streak , okay . Okay , I have a source . It 's reliable . I can 't explain it . It can cause some serious problems . Is it a doctor ? Tell me what you do to bring in the fix ! No , it 's nothing like that . Look , you wouldn 't believe me if I told you . Can 't you just ride my bets ? - Yeah , just make the same bets I do . - I know what " ride " means . You are such a piece of shit . I hope you enjoyed the peep-show , Jasper . I 'll take that . - Finn , this is ... - I was just leaving . So , are we good ? So , he basically knows . He doesn 't know jack shit . Well he knows that you have some kind of information . How long is he gonna be content just piggybacking your bets . I don 't know . Forever . I got it under control . You look like hell , Jasper . Are you sleeping ? You know what , man ? Get off my dick . You and Callie both , get all this money for doing nothing . You should be happy . We are all in this . Callie and I are sharing the risk . I just hope that you have a backup plan in case this thing with your bookie falls through . I seem to remember you wearing something a little different in tonight 's photo . Screw you Jasper . I 'm not gonna start as long as he 's here . You know , Jasper was just about to take a walk . - Weren 't you ? - I am ? - Yeah . Yes , don 't forget to come spy on me at 8 o 'clock . So I don 't really know what I 'm doing here . You 're gonna have to walk me through it . Sure . We just need to get you in the same pose in the photo and then I do the rest . You know , I would really like to know how you got me to do this . You and I both . What are you thinking ? Just you 're really ... you 're very beautiful . Don 't sound so surprised . No , it 's just , I guess it takes a moment like this to wake a guy up . So he can actually see what 's right in front of him . It 's amazing . Even hazy and out of focus . You can still recognize your own silhouette . I wondered all day ... How ? How is this possible ? So . Marcus here , he 's gonna babysit . And you . You 're gonna take me to see what 's over there . I would not have believed it if you told me . Kicks them out , every night at 8 . What about the daytime ones ? I don 't know . Since we found it , it 's only been doing them at night . What 's this ? That 's the newest one . Here 's the deal . Every day you 're gonna take this photo . You 're gonna write down the stats that go in the window tomorrow . - Marcus is gonna come by and pick up the photo for safe keeping . - Wait . Wait a second . I 'm not gonna repeat myself ! The three of you are gonna sit right there just like that , on the couch , so I know you 're behaving . And you tell no one about this . I don 't want anyone messing with our little golden goose here . I want 50 percent . You take a zero off that number . That still makes you a very lucky man . I feel real lucky . We didn 't agree to this . You should 've talked to us . I did my best . We 're still gonna get some money . He 's gonna be making a lot of bets . It 'll be fine . What happens when the guy above him gets wise to what 's going on ? How many more scary motherfuckers are going to show up here looking for pieces ? Ivan 's smart , he 's not going to fuck this up . That 's very reassuring . It 's unbelievable . Where is the photo from yesterday ? Wait , you 're not seriously going to paint at a time like this , are you ? Yes , what else are we suppoesd to do ? We obviously have no control over what 's happening . He 's keeping the photos . For safe keeping . No , that is totally unacceptable . Call him , right now . Tell him we 'll put up the results on the window , but we 're keeping the goddamn photos . Are you a fucking child ? You 're aware of who 's on the other end of this phone , right ? I 'm gonna make some tea , babe . Do you want anything ? You know , you were always doing the paintings . You were just seeing what you 'd already done . I 'm aware of that , Callie . That 's what 's so maddening . I painted them in the future , and now that I can 't see the photograph , I end up not painting . Jasper . What ? Couldn 't you just sneak a photo of the Polaroid when it pops up , just grab one on the phone ? Since you don 't see the picture today , there won 't be a painting for me to photograph tomorrow . There will be if you agree to take the fucking photograph . Look man , if your decisions are gonna continue to dictate my future , can you at least make one that benefits me ? And risk my neck being broken , just because you can 't find your Mojo ? Fuck that . - Can 't you just be happy with the money ? - No . I can 't , Jasper . I don 't give a shit about the money . At this point I 'd rather call the police . or fill a bucket of water and spill it all over your precious machine . Is that a fucking threat ? No it 's not , but you can 't ignore the fact that some of us aren 't making out on this deal very well . I 'll see what I can do . There is a painting . Thank the Lord . How about thanking Jasper ? What now ? Well it 's just it 's kind of strange . Doesn 't look like something I would normally paint . Looks like you did it in a hurry . See ? The paint is still dripping . - Maybe it 's a warning . - About what ? Maybe something bad is about to happen . You 're sending us a warning . Look , we look scared , right ? And I 'm staring up at that painting . I 'm trying to tell myself something . I mean , we don 't look happy , but the situation isn 't exactly ideal . No , you said it yourself , Finn . That 's not something you 'd normally paint . Yeah , but art 's weird , man . I 'm just glad that there is something on the canvas . Just relax , Jasper . What if Jasper is right ? What if something terrible is going to happen tomorrow ? Then we wouldn 't be in the photo , right ? We would have left . OK . Why don 't we ? - You want to leave ? - Yes , we can pack our bags and just go . You want to just leave Jasper ? Deal with everything on his own ? He wouldn 't care . He 'd be fine . The machine over there ... you can 't just walk away from it . And there 's still hope for things to work out . Why would we do that ? OK . I trust you . Besides you have to admit . This machine it 's working magic on you . What I can say ? I like being your muse . Hey Joe . You 're not on duty tonight ? Actually , yesterday was my last shift . I 'm just dropping off the keys . - Last shift ? - Yeah man , I 'm moving up to the big time . Congratulations . That 's great . Everything alright ? Let me give you one of my cards . Let 's have a drink sometime . - Stay in touch , man . - You too , Joe . What 's wrong ? Marcus just caught me talking to Big Joe . What the fuck happened ? Well nothing happened . It 's Big Joe 's last night , so he gives me his card . - What did Marcus do ? - He made a phone call . He drove off . Motherfucking Shit ! Fuck ! Can 't we just tell them it wasn 't anything ? No , because he 's not gonna believe us . Alright , it 's OK . It 's OK , because I fucking planned for this . I hid weapons around the house . Wait . What ? Only because you made that fucking skull painting . You have to make that painting before the camera goes off . Make the fucking painting ! OK . I 'm sorry , you hid weapons in our house ? Yes , I hid weapons in our fucking house . - Why did you hide weapons ? - Do you know who the fuck these people are ? What exactly did you hide ? - Just sit still and calm down . - No , I 'm very worried ... Just sit still and calm down ! - What happens after the picture gets taken ? - We wait . We just sit here and wait ? They 'll come in and ask us some questions . And if it goes well , that 'll be that . What if it doesn 't go well ? Finn , there is a hammer under the couch . He was just the building 's rent-a-cop . Then why is this a police officer 's card ? Well he just became one . He was dropping off his keys , it was his last shift . I didn 't tell him anything about you or the machine . I would love to believe that . Unfortunately ... I can 't afford to trust you . What 's he looking for ? Maybe I can help . Is this your girlfriend ? Yes , maybe you can help . Now let 's see if we can remember anything new . I see you , boyfriend . Adrenaline . Heart racing . Trust me . You 're not fast enough . There is an easy way out of this . And that 's just to answer my fucking question . Please don 't . You gonna die . Why do I feel a total lack of concern ? Because you haven 't seen tomorrow 's photo yet . It shows your murder . And who kills me , huh ? You ? He does . Maybe it 's for the money . You must have a fortune in winnings already . Keys . You should slide your chair over this way . I 'm serious . Once he sees that photo he 's gonna aim through that window and shoot you in the back . Smart move . Where is Jasper ? Marcus , where is ... ? Where is he ? ! Jasper , fucking stop ! Hi Mrs. Anderson .. No it was Callie . She burned her hand on the stove . Yeah , everything 's fine . We can 't leave them in here forever . No shit ! It 's just for now . What 's next ? Next ? Next I got get my money from Ivan 's . Thank you for cleaning up the living room . You mean the blood ? Thank you for cleaning up the blood ? That could have been mine ? You 're welcome . - Don 't ! - I 'm just trying to make sure you 're okay . Do I look okay ? What can I do ? Why don 't you go paint ? Holy hell ! I know , right ? This is just the start . I think ... I think we should leave . Split the money , get out of the country , get on the other side , just get away from the machine . Are you out of your fucking mind ? The safest place on Earth is right here . As long as we see ourselves in that photo everyday we know we 're alive tomorrow . - Callie and I , we uh ... - We what ? You know . All I know is that Jasper saved my life tonight . I 'm going to bed . Jasper , can you give me something to sleep ? Thank you . Hello , I 'm Dr. Heidecker .. Forgive the hour and my appearance . How can I help you ? Henry Bezzerides , is a colleague of mine . Does he live in the apartment across the way ? Yeah . Yes , he does . I knocked . There was no answer . What 's going on ? A Dr. Heidecker is here . She 's looking for Mr. Bezzerides . Did you tell her he moved out a couple of months ago ? Did he give you his hat , before he left ? So we found his journal , and from what we 've read I guess he saw something bad . - And he tried to change it . - I know , he sent me a letter . After Henry retired , he kept me up on his experiments . To be honest , I didn 't think they 'd amount to much . Poor Henry . Yeah . Don 't fuck with time . Do you think time did this ? That he was somehow punished for trying to change the future ? Well what else would do that to someone ? Thorium gas would be my first guess . You see the coil under there ? I 'm guessing he was stretching for it up on that shelf there when he knocked over the cannister . It was just an accident , his death . That 's all . Nothing more . I suspect ... he was panicked whilst in the process of .. ... trying to avoid this . You see his hat on the couch , and what looks like his blood on the window ? Seems that met an unpleasant end . But clearly this photograph which takes place tomorrow had nothing to do with him at all . Oh , it 's ironic . Tomorrow ? How could he have taken the photo when the camera only shoots one day ahead of time ? Why ? I don 't know where you 're getting your data , but I believe you 're mistaken . This letter is postmarked a week ago so he had to have taken the photo at least that far in advance . - How could he have taken that photo ? You 're telling me you can shoot a photo whenever you want ? No , I don 't know about whenever you want . Evidently , Henry had moved passed the initial tests and had got it to look further . Do you think you can change the settings ? Henry shared his results with me , but not his methods . I don 't know any more about the control than you do . That 's too bad . That lady didn 't mean us any harm . What about the gun in her hand ? She wasn 't gonna use it . You don 't fucking know that , okay . And if I didn 't act , then Callie would be waking up to our dead bodies . At the very least the police would 've shown up . Sounds like Jasper is just trying to protect us . You were not there . - Ready for your big moment ? - Hell yes ! Do you want me to go over there and make sure you 've got it right ? What 's tomorrow 's look like ? Hey , Callie ? Is that tomorrow 's photo ? Well fine , I dont ' want to see it . Can we please pack up your bags and let 's leave ? You 're not going anywhere . Do you know that Dr. Heidecker ? She said it was an accident . So that means things can change . And I think I 'm gonna take my chances with that . So please , come on . Go ahead . Commit suicide . But don 't kill your girlfriend in the process . Wait , you 're in the photo ? Okay , fine . Let me see it . Oh rip the band-aid off already . How 's she doing ? What is she doing ? She 's passed out . She was distraught . I gave her something . It 'll take the edge off . It was so good when it was good . We had such a cool relationship . - Sorry , man . - Oh it 's not your fault , it 's my fault . I got this a year ago . And I couldn 't pull the trigger . - Why 's that ? - You were right , I was scared . Coward . I 'm not a painter , I 'm a glorified janitor and she deserves more than that . I mean I wanna be more . I get it . I 've been blaming you in my head for all of this . Who knows , maybe it was me that was making the decisions secretly . Sabotaging everything out of fear . Maybe there 's a way to fix this . I think it 's too late . You know . I 'm actually starting to like that smell . How fucked up is that ? When I saw the suitcase I knew you 'd left the program . I don 't give a fuck what Dr. Heiden-schmeiden says . You don 't fuck with time . I need you alive . At least one more day . If I have to drag you and put you on that sofa myself . So help me , I will . This should keep you warm . Help ! Help me ! Somebody help . The gun . Goddammit Jasper . I paint this today . This is from two weeks ago . Did I send you down here ? Why would I do that ? Thank you . Who the fuck is this ? Motherfucker ! Don 't you dare . I 'll fucking kill you where you stand . Well if you do that , the bucket 's gonna fall . Get Callie and give her the phone . Don 't push it . - Callie , can you see me ? Jasper knocked me out last night and he locked me in the storage unit . He 's going to kill you . No , he would never ... Give me the phone . If you don 't put that bucket down , I 'm gonna blow her brains all over this fucking window . You 're going to kill us anyway You 're going to kill me if I put the bucket down or not . There 's only one way out of this . We walk away . If we walk away you get to keep your machine . Hurry up , this bucket is getting heavy . Give Callie the phone . Callie , I want you to look in Jasper 's hoodie-pocket . He has something of yours . Something I got a long time ago . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry that I haven 't been there for you . It 's okay . You are now . Take the gun . Take it away from Jasper . Give me the gun . Give me the gun . Give it to me . Now back up . Over there . Whatever you say . - I 'll be there in 30 seconds . - OK . You know what ? Maybe this will keep you warm at night . Where will you go ? Far . We 're gonna need some of this . Take as much as you want . Because you can always make more , right ? Don 't forget your ring . Oh my God . I really killed him . You had no choice . Come sit down . Are you okay ? - I 'm gonna get you some ice . - Okay , but we need to go . Look , the photo . It changed . Oh , thank God . When I saw that photo of you two together ... Now it 's okay . I didn 't think I 'd be able to change anything if Dr. Heidecker 's letter didn 't .. Oh shit . I need to paint this . I don 't understand . I paint this for Mr. B so so I 'd be able to use his keys to get out of the storage unit . It doesn 't matter . I 'll tell you when we leave . We need to go before the cops show up here . Okay . I 'm gonna get you that ice . This is impossible . I was always going to paint this ? I haven 't changed anything . And where did this come from ? - I thought you were getting ice . - I was . I am . What were you saying ? It doesn 't matter . Here . You should probably go lie down . Put this ice on his head . What the fuck was that ? The camera just went off . I can explain . Wait , wait , wait . Tell me what 's going on . - Look , let 's just go sit down . - No ! Talk ! Remember when we got the call that Mr. B was behind on his rent and I went to check on him ? Hey Mr. Bezzerides , are you home ? I found the machine , and sticking out of the camera was a photo . Throw the hanger . The reason there are night time and day time photos on the wall of Mr. B 's apartment is because the camera takes a photo at 8 PM and 8 AM . By keeping you and Jasper from knowing that I could secretly pass messages back to myself . You 're up early . So when I caught you in the kitchen just now .. What were you doing ? I was hiding this . Last night when Jasper posed with all of the money I switched out the photos . I switched them back just now . I 've seen all the night time photos and Jasper is dead , so ... When was this taken ? It 's from before . Before when ? Before before . A month ago , drunk charades . Look it didn 't mean anything . I was just acting out . Get drunk some times . Look it was almost if I wanted to get caught so you would wake up . That 's an excuse , yeah . I 'm sorry for being so weak . It 's just I can 't believe that you and allowed this . You had opportunity to prevent it , to warn us about it . Why didn 't you do that ? I was just doing what the photos told me to . I was getting pulled along like we all were . And don 't you see ? Everything happened for a reason . Look . Everything we had before was fading . You were so distant . But ... You got jealous for the first time in ages . And I finally got to feel your kiss again . And you said it it takes a moment like this to wake a guy up to what 's right in front of him . Little by little , we were coming back together . You kept picking the machine and your work over us so I had to do something to bring you back to your senses . And then today . You fought for us . Harder than I have ever seen you fight for anything . So in the end , everything worked out . Everything worked out ... What are you doing ? I 'm gonna do what we should 've done from the start . And I 'm gonna destroy that fucking machine . Stop . Please stop . You said we can change things , right ? Then all I have to do , is put a new note in the window for tonight 's picture . When I get the message last night . I 'll know to prevent you from catching me at the window just now . You 'll never find the photos . We 'll never have had this conversation . If you destroy the machine , I can 't fix this . I wish you hadn 't made me do that . It 's gonna be okay . We won 't remember any of this tomorrow . It 's gonna be okay . What are you doing here , Joe ? I got a message from Finn . He said that you two were leaving town . And I might be interested to see what Jasper was up to . What 's on the window ? Can I come in ? Sure . Fine . It doesn 't matter . Tonight none of this will matter . I guess you might have some questions for me . = = Subs by Sub * Sequenta = =

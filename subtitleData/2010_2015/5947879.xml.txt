 Can you take a break from your phone for a second ? Sorry . Vinny wanted me to show a house this weekend . Calvin , you can 't . We 're going up to the cabin . I know . That 's what I 'm telling him . See ? Great . Listen , honey . I ... I know you 're nervous about seeing her again but you don 't have to worry . I 'm here for you . And I 'm sure it 'll be fine . Just like old times . That 's what I 'm afraid of . So , tell me what she 's like . I don 't really know . I don 't even talk to her that much . I mean , when you were younger . Well , we were both kind of rebellious . You ? Rebellious ? - In my own way . - Yeah , sure . I will believe when I see it . Oh , my God ! That 's her . - Rebecca , are you all right ? - Yeah , it 's just ... Not much has changed . How old were you last time you were here ? - I don 't know . Maybe ... - 16 . So , what 's the plan ? Maybe we should get unpacked . And settled . No . I wanna do this first . - Are you sure ? - Yeah . You sure you want me here ? You can go first if you want . No . It 's okay . You were closer to her . Mom , I 've never had to deal with life without you . Every memory I have , you 're there with me . When dad died , you were the one who rocked me to sleep . I know how much this place meant to you . To us . Here , you say something . This is the closest I 've been to mom in 12 years . Can you believe this is the first time I 've been up here ? After all this time . It 's a nice place . I always wanted a cabin growing up , my family was poor as dirt . I was lucky if I got to go camping . So , you 're in real estate ? I 'm ... still fairly new at it . But I ... I think I 've got what it takes . There 's ... It 's good money in it . - And Abby ? - She 's in marketing for a record company . Indie bands , small label . Very hip . She 's ... she 's good at it too . So , what do you do ? Hey , how was your shower , babe ? Amazing , as long as you don 't like water pressure . - Who does ? - What you got there ? It 's my old knife . From Girl Scouts . I thought I had lost it . So , what have you been telling your fiance about me ? - Why ? What were you two talking about ? - We were just chatting . Actually , Abby told me you two were a couple of hell raisers back in the day . - I never said that . - Yes , you did . You told me this morning . Yeah , Abby was a real rebel . Remember you got a B - in Algebra ? - She cried for two days . - That didn 't happen . Yes , it did . You thought Mr. Zolinsky was disappointed in you . Okay , so I should have punched him in the face like you did and punish him for my bad grade . - Okay , you remember that . - Yeah . - You punched a teacher in the face ? - No , not exactly . Yeah , it was more like , just his right eye . Wow , that 's bad ass . - I never punched a teacher in the face . - Don 't worry . There 's still time . Honey , you look a little empty handed . - How about some wine ? - Yes . Thank you . So ... How are things in Louisville ? How 's Aunt Linda doing these days ? She 's okay . Do you talk her much ? No , not in long time . I was getting sick of her lectures . - She 's still a little off ? - Yeah . It 's getting worse as she gets older . She was there for us though , when mom got sick . So , that 's something . Well , we 're glad you 're here . Feels weird though . Doesn 't it ? Yeah . It 's ... I don 't know . I don 't know what to think . Are you doing okay ? You seem okay . If you ever feel like you wanna leave , just let us know . No , this is good . I should be here . My therapist in Louisville told me I should come back and face this place , if I had any hope of putting what happened behind me . Well , we 're here for you . You were acting a little strange tonight . Was I ? Come on , Calvin . You seemed pretty uptight around her . I still remember when you were afraid that corner store guy didn 't like you . Yeah , he was a tough nut to crack . Seriously . What 's going on ? You know , you never talk about it . About what happened to Rebecca . We 're going to get married next year . And you have to trust me . It 's not that . Just ... It 's just a messed up situation . I don 't like to talk about it . I understand . But she 's here now . So maybe , you should let me in on this . Well ... You know , she was kidnapped . And ... Yeah , I remember all that . - Her boyfriend , right ? - Chuck . - And she tried to kill herself ? - No . Not right away . There was something else . They never reported . Mom kept it quiet . When they found her , she was pregnant . Mom made her get a ... abortion . Oh , my God . I am so sorry . We don 't have to talk about this if you don 't want to . I 'm sorry I brought it up . No , it 's not that . It 's just ... Calvin , it was my fault . No . No , Abby , that is not true . We were up here for the weekend . We were close , then . Then , we had this huge fight about Chuck . I knew he was a scumbag and I ... I wouldn 't leave it alone . And we were screaming at each other , and then she ran off into the woods and I ... I didn 't see again until after the search party found her . Abby , it 's not your fault . You couldn 't have known . If I hadn 't chased her away , it wouldn 't have happened . Abby , that 's not true . Chuck was obviously a psychopath . If it didn 't happen then , it could have happened another time . Great . That makes me feel so much better . I didn 't mean it like that . You 're a great motivational speaker . I ... I know this is a horrible situation , but ... At least , Rebecca is here now . With us . We 'll do everything we can , for her . We 'll make it work . The worst is behind her . We can be a family . How are you , happy camper ? City slickers won 't leave me be . They know not the meaning of a true vacation . Speaking of which , thought you said you wouldn 't work while we were up here ? Honey . No . I 'll get her . - Sure ? - Yeah . Go back to work . Rebecca ? Okay . Rebecca ? Rebecca ? Rebecca ! Rebecca ? What is the matter ? Sorry . I just ... Something about this place reminds me of that night . What did your doctor tell you ? To take a tour down memory lane ? Doesn 't he understand what you went through ? You don 't understand . It 's not that simple . Then lay it out for me . I had to come up here . I can 't explain it . Don 't you worry about anything . What happened is in the past . I 'm here now and we 're gonna get through this together . I know you wanna help me , but you don 't know what I 've seen . What is that ? - What happened here ? - Let 's go back . It 's really light . There must have been a plane crash . - Abby , I don 't know ... - Looks like it happened recently . We shouldn 't be here . Abby ... Rebecca ? - Did you see it ? - Yeah , it 's definitely a crash . Not sure about this , though . Do you think it was a bad idea we came up here ? It 's too late to worry about that now . We just have to deal with the situation as it stands . Yeah . I guess so . I just wish I knew why she freaked out . What she went through was traumatic . I don 't think she was ready to face it . Calvin , just because you took those online psychology courses , doesn 't mean that you can cross-analyze everyone . Jesus , Abby . Calm down . Sorry . It 's just ... - It 's been a stressful day . - How 's Rebecca doing ? I gave her something to help her sleep . Rest is probably the best thing right now . How are you feeling ? Okay . Are you hungry ? Do you wanna get up and stretch your legs ? We shouldn 't have gone up there . - Becca , what 's bothering you ? - We weren 't meant to find that . You brought that back ? - We have to get rid of that , right now . - Becca , calm down . What 's the big deal ? - I don 't want it around me . - Calvin , get it out of here . - Get it away from me . - Calvin , now . Okay . It 's okay . It 's gone . Now , what 's gotten into you ? We shouldn 't have come back here . This was a mistake . Becca , I don 't understand why you 're acting like this . Nothing happened up there . Everything happened up there . It 's beautiful out here . Yeah . It 's okay , honey . She 's gonna be fine . It 's just a transition period . You think so ? After what she 's been through ? Plus your mom sheltered her after everything that happened , right ? That 's what I used to think , but ... Or maybe mom was just trying to protect her . No . Abby , don 't start thinking that way . It 's better that Rebecca faces this now and learns how to stand on her own two feet . We can help her do that . Maybe you 're right . I like hearing that . Don 't hear it too often . That 's because it 's not true all that often . I really appreciate you being here for me . And Rebecca . Of course . I love you . Hello ? Becca , is that you ? What do you want ? We have to leave this place . Calvin . - Rebecca , Good Morning . - Good morning . Where 's Abby ? She 's ... She 's out at the car . Organizing . - You feeling any better ? - Organizing ? Yeah , we packed up our stuff this morning . We 're going home . Abby ? Oh , sweetie . How 're you feeling ? - Okay , I guess . - Good . I know you packed light , so I figured we 'd just eat on the road . Why are you in such a rush ? Last night , you were the one who was in a rush . What are you talking about ? You came into my room and said we had to leave . What do you mean ? I slept the whole night . No , I ... I walked you out my room , and ... And then ... Okay . Whatever . Sounds like you had the most boring dream ever . I 'll go get my bag . - This is such a nice place , Abby . - We just bought it . It was our first act as a soon-to-be-married couple . Looks expensive . Well , it was a little bit of a stretch . But Calvin got us a really good deal . The guest room is all set up for you . Yeah . I ... I 'll show it to you . You 'll be really comfortable there . Thank you so much , you two . I really appreciate how welcoming you 've been . Don 't mention it . You 're family . Hey , what 's going on down here ? Calvin ? Oh , my God , you brought that home ? Abby , you 've ... You 've got to check this out . The table 's uneven , right ? Lift the edge of the table . - Why ? - Just ... grab the edge . Lift it . Hey , what are you guys doing ? Is that what I think it is ? I 'm sorry , sweetie . I didn 't know . It was ... It was totally me . This thing is ... I have never seen anything like it . - Well , what do you think it is ? - I don 't know . But that was a crash out there , right ? Well , every plane has to have a black box . A black box ? Yeah . They 're indestructible . They record everything that happens to a plane . They come in handy when one goes down . The engineers study it . Find out what happened that caused the accident . So , it 's a black box ? I don 't know . Shouldn 't it look like a box ? I ... I don 't know . It could be some new model . Why did you want me to lift the table ? I was just doing some tests , but ... If it 's gonna bother anyone ... you know , we don 't have to . - Do what you were gonna do . - All right , Abby . Grab the edge of the table and lift it to make an incline . Little higher . What the fuck ? That is not a black box . You shouldn 't have brought that here . It 's just a fucking black ball . Who knows what it is ? That is exactly why you shouldn 't have taken it . What if it is a military thing ? Absolutely . It could be something experimental . A prototype . So , why do we want that ? - What if it 's worth something ? - So it 's about the money ? I don 't know but it could be worth a lot . And if it isn 't , I just wanna know what it is . What if it 's dangerous ? Dangerous how ? That you might step on it and slip ? What if it 's radioactive or something ? - Are you kidding me right now ? - I don 't know . Listen , it 's fine . I promise . If at any time , it seems like it might be dangerous , we 'll contact the authorities . - The authorities ? - The police . The fucking army . Whatever . We 'll hand it right off . But it might be worth something and how will we know unless we find out what it is first ? This could be good for us . Help pay for this house that you love so much . Okay . If it seems dangerous at any point , it 's gone . - Abby . - It 's fine . Now , I 'm not scared of ... Whatever it is . Neither am I. Rebecca ? Calvin ? Calvin ? Calvin ! Honey , what 's wrong ? I ... My God ... I had a nightmare . It 's okay . You 're awake now . So , nobody knocked these over ? Honey , I swear . As much as I like to avoid incurring the wrath of Abby , I would not lie about this one . I didn 't do it . Oh , my God . I 'm really gonna be late . Vinny 's gonna kill me . - Have a good day at work , honey . - You too . Love you . Oh , Rebecca , feel free to dig into the books or movies if you get bored . Thanks . See you later . I gotta go too . I 'm sorry it 's so busy this morning . I didn 't sleep well last night , I lost track of time . - It 's fine . - If you need anything , call me . And if you can 't get a hold of me , Calvin 's number is on the fridge . All right . Just make yourself at home . - Thank you . - Yup . Hello . Abby . Wow ! Hi , Aunt Linda . Been a while since we 've spoken . What 's up ? I was checking in on Rebecca . She hasn 't been answering her phone . Well , she 's been doing great . Really great . I love having her here . - It 's just like old ... - And your mother 's ashes ? We took care of that right away . Rebecca and I did it together . Good . We took them up to the old cabin and we spread them out on the ... You did what ? We poured them into the lake at the cabin . - Aunt Linda ? - What did you think you were doing ? - I don 't understand ? - Send Rebecca home , on the next bus . You have done enough , don 't cause her any more pain . What the fuck is that supposed to mean ? You should never have taken her up there . - What are you ... - Send her back home before it 's too late . - What are you talking about ? - Abby , send her home . Hey ! What was that about ? Sounded serious . It was nothing . A solicitor . Yeah , mom used to curse those guys out too . How was work ? - It was good . - Good . When do you have to get back to Louisville ? I don 't know . I bought a one-way ticket . - Check this out ! - Calvin ! Not a scratch on it . And that tells us what ? - That should 've taken a chunk out of it . - But it didn 't . Calvin , it 's almost time for dinner . Can we please go upstairs ? Oh , Jesus ! Sorry , I thought you heard me coming down the stairs . What are you doing ? I couldn 't sleep . Is everything all right ? I just ... Had another weird dream . What was it ? I don 't know . Just weird . I haven 't been feeling too well , lately . Yeah , I 'm gonna call Dr. Lieberman in the morning , see if he will squeeze me in for a checkup . Yeah , I bet he 'd like to squeeze you in . Calvin , shut up . You are the only woman I know that can get a doctor 's appointment on the same day she calls . Why do you think that is ? You have a headache ? Yeah , my head has been hurting me the past couple of days . What if it 's that thing ? Nah , that doesn 't make any sense . You 've been spending a lot of time down here lately , maybe it has something to do with it . No , not my ... My head 's been bugging me for a couple of weeks , before the cabin . You just said it was only a couple of days . I know . Yeah , I 'm sorry . I didn 't want to worry you . Calvin , you have to tell me these things . I do worry about you . I 'm gonna get you an appointment with the doctor tomorrow , too . Okay . Come to bed soon , please . Okay , Abby . Looked at your charts . - Any good news , doctor ? - Maybe . So you say you 've been feeling sick the past week or so . Yeah , sort of nauseated . Does it tend to come on stronger in the morning ? Like a morning sickness ? I suppose . Wait , are you saying what I think you are saying ? We 're sorry , your call ... - Wow ! That was a waste of time . - What ? Well ... Apparently the medical community is fairly impotent when it comes to headaches . They told me to take two aspirin , like I don 't know that . They didn 't say anything else ? There wasn 't much to say . I took a full physical instead . They said it was overdue . How was your appointment dear ? The good doctor was happy to see you , I 'm sure . He said I was pregnant . What ? - Really ? - Yeah . Honey , that 's great . - Really ? - Oh , my God . Yeah ! Okay , I can see you are excited but what about work ? What about work ? They have maternity leave , right ? I 'll put in some more hours ... Push some more properties , I can make enough for both of us . Calvin , I like where I am at with my job right now . What if months of maternity leave jeopardizes my position ? Listen , honey , I know how important landing that job was to you . But this , is a baby we 're talking about here . Our baby . And with everything that 's happened lately , your mother passing away , and your sister coming to stay with us . Hasn 't it made you think ? - Think about what ? - Just about family . About how important it is , and how little of it we have left . I 'm excited about starting a family with you . Just feel lucky you don 't have to carry our family around in your uterus . I don 't have a uterus . But , I will carry you wherever you want . What the fuck ? Oh , God ! What are you doing ? Sorry . Are you okay ? Where were you ? Don 't you know how late it is ? What 's wrong ? Why did you put that thing under the bed ? What are you talking about ? This stupid sphere . Why did you put it under the bed ? - Calvin , I want it gone . - Don 't be ridiculous . What did you just say to me ? Look , I ... I just mean , that this thing is harmless . We still don 't know what it is . Calvin , are you even listening to yourself ? You just said we don 't know what it is , so how can you know that it 's harmless . What 's going on ? Why are you acting like this ? I 'm having nightmares . Yeah , I know . They say that can happen in the early stages of pregnancy . Like the ones I 've been having ? I don 't think so . No . Really . Vivid dreams or nightmares can be the product of all the hormones from the baby . How do you know this ? Well ... You know all those pamphlets Dr. Lieberman gave us ? I 've been reading them . Really ? Yeah . Honey , I know that you 're scared . But you don 't have to go through this alone . I may not be experiencing exactly what you are , but I can help you . I still want that thing gone . I don 't like it . Okay . I promise . You 're quite the cook ? What is that supposed to mean ? Nothing . It 's just nice to know that some things never change . I am sorry for taking the time of cooking you breakfast . Relax , Abby . I was just kidding . Yeah . You and Calvin are always kidding . Maybe I 'm not in the mood for anymore fucking jokes . Jesus ! Sorry . Next time , give me a heads up when you 're in a bad mood . You know , my therapist says it 's not healthy to take out your frustrations on others . Well , we all don 't have the luxury of running away to Kentucky , every time something goes wrong . Is that what you think happened ? You think we left it all behind and everything got better ? It must have helped , or you wouldn 't have done it . I 'm sorry , Becca . I understand ... I guess . If my boyfriend did to me what Chuck did to you , - I would have run away , too . - Abby , none of that happened . - What are you saying ? - Chuck didn 't rape me . Of course , it happened . You were pregnant . I didn 't know what happened during the time I was missing . I didn 't remember . Not at first . Becca , what 's going on ? You made me so angry that night ... telling me what I could and couldn 't do . I ran away wishing you weren 't my sister . I walked through the woods , to Sal 's gas station out on the main road . Called Chuck to come and get me . He showed up a little while later and ... we talked . Parked by the side of the road . He was sorry that you and I were fighting about him . He really wasn 't such a bad guy . But then something happened . And the lights in the dashboard died . I thought maybe we had been sitting on the side of the road too long . Killed the battery , you know ? But , Chuck wasn 't so sure . When the lights came back on , he started up the car . It seemed like he wanted to get us back into town in a hurry . We took McLusky Road , as a shortcut . We were so close to the cabin . I thought you might see us . There was no light out there . Just what we could see in the headlights . We went up this incline , and when we came down the other side , there was ... What ? Abby , there were three ... Three what ? I 'm sorry . Maybe we shouldn 't talk about this right now . Becca , we 've been not talking about this for 12 years . I think it 's way past time when we started talking about it . Abby , there were three UFOs . UFOs ? - Like , flying saucers ? - I know you know what UFOs are . You used to love the X Files . Yeah , but I didn 't believe . We saw them . Chuck hit the brakes hard and then the car just , died . I started screaming . I couldn 't stop . I 've never been so scared in my whole life . No , I don 't know what to do with this . I can 't ... I can 't think about this right now . - Abby ... - That is just a lot to take in . I 'm not really sure I ... You should sit down . Why didn 't anybody tell me this before ? It took a lot of time . A lot of therapy to start remembering . So what did mom think ? She knew about this ? Apparently , I was babbling about this shit when she found me . When Chuck never showed back up , everyone else said I was out of my head . And that what really happened is that he kidnapped and raped me . But mom believed me . Even when I didn 't fully remember what happened . She trusted what she had seen in my eyes when they first found me . What about the baby ? I 'd been with Chuck before . I didn 't even know I was pregnant until after they found me and ran tests . After everything happened , I was ... I just couldn 't think straight . I guess I believed what they said was true and ... I let mom convince me to ... Get the ... What happened after the car died ? There were these horrible creatures . Not little green men at all . They came out of their ships and they took us . We couldn 't fight back . We were frozen . What happened to Chuck ? They took Chuck away . I heard him screaming , but I never saw him again . Abby , I 'm so sorry . I wish I had had the guts to tell you sooner . Mom said we should never talk about it with anyone . It 's just the baby . I 'm gonna go lay down for a while . You don 't wanna talk about this anymore ? Becca , just let me go and lay down . Who 's running away , now ? - Hey , you 're finally home . - Where 's Abby ? She 's been resting most of the day . She hasn 't been feeling well . Thanks for taking care of her . I 'll be in the basement . So , what are you doing down there ? No , no , no , no . I can 't . They 're family . We have a family . It 's our family . I can 't do it . I won 't . What test ? Well , if , but , If ... If I can 't , then , then who ? Who ? It 's not mine ? No . Okay . Yeah . No ! Calvin ? Calvin ! Abby ? What 's wrong ? Where 's Calvin ? I don 't know . I haven 't seen him since I went to sleep . Is he in the house ? Let me check . It looks like his car is gone . He 's always gone when I need him . Okay . Well , I 'm here . Can you talk to me ? I had another nightmare . Another ? I 've been having them ever since we were up at the cabin . There 's bright lights , and then horrible creatures and then they grab me , and ... I knew something was wrong . We should have never gone up to the cabin . What are you talking about ? Mom told me that grandma used to tell her stories about weird things happening in the woods by the cabin , I just ... Stop trying to put horrible things into my head . The only reason I had the dream is because you 've filled my mind with a bunch of sci-fi bullshit . I can 't handle this . I feel like I 'm going crazy . No . Abby ? You 're not going crazy . Don 't think that for a second . That 's what they want you to think . I don 't need this , Rebecca . This isn 't helping . I just want Calvin . Where is he ? Last I saw , he was heading for the basement . Abby , wait . He said he 'd get rid of it . Abby ? Abby , what are you doing ? If he won 't get rid of it , I will . - Good . I 'll go with you . - Stay away from me , Rebecca . My life has been nothing but a disaster since this thing showed up . You mean since I showed up . Well , I never would have found it , if you didn 't go crying off into the woods . I only ever do that when you are around . Rebecca ? Becca . Where 's the sphere , Abby ? Fuck you . Where have you been all night ? Where is it ? I got rid of it . Just like you said you were going to . It 's gone . What ? Where is it ? Abby , that ... sphere ... Could make us rich . It 's time to stop fucking around , Calvin . There are more important things to be worrying about , like all the time you 're spending at work . And in the basement . You told me that family was the most important thing to you , but you 're never around . And even when you 're here , you 're not really here . How dare you talk to me about family ? What 's that supposed to mean ? I got a call from Dr. Lieberman 's office this morning . Yeah , so ? What did they say ? Abby , I 'm sterile . - What are you saying ? - I 'm fucking sterile . Sterile . I can 't have kids . It 's not my baby , you fucking bitch . That 's not possible . It is possible . It 's more than possible . It 's a fucking fact . It 's science . I 'm sterile . It 's not my baby . So ... You wanna talk ? You wanna talk about family ? Come on . Let 's talk . Whose is it ? - It 's yours . - Yeah . Right . Whose is it ? Somebody from your fucking office ? Who , Abby ? Who ? I 've only been with you . Right . Of course . Immaculate conception , I suppose . I am so honored . This baby , is really going to be something special . This is Linda Wallace . - I 'm not here right now . - Shit ! Please leave a message after the beep . Aunt Linda ... It 's me , again . Hey . I need to talk to you . I don 't know what 's happening , and ... Rebecca is gone . I think I 'm going crazy . Hello . Abby ? Aunt Linda , yeah . I 'm here . Where 's Rebecca ? I don 't know . I told you to send her home . I knew something might happen . She told me what happened . And ... I 've been having these ... - dreams . - Abby , stop . I don 't wanna hear it . What ? Our family has dealt with a lot of weird shit over the years . There 's only way that we 've been able to cope . You don 't talk about it . - That 's crazy . - Don 't start with me , Abby . It 's not my fault you were too good to see things for what they were . You were always too good for the rest of us . You want answers ? I 'm not going to give them to you . I don 't know where Rebecca is . So could you just give me something ? Dr. Sydney Mora . He 's the one who performed the abortion . Go ahead and talk to him . Well , what can I tell you about my most famous patient ? Rebecca ... told me a story . I don 't know what to believe , though . What , you don 't believe your own sister ? She 's unwell . All these things tend to ... run in the family . I can 't find her and I thought if you told me about what happened then , it may help me now . Well , frankly , I 'm not surprised that she 's missing . I always thought they 'd come back . With all the things these visitors can do , I 'm sure finding an old test subject isn 't very difficult . You 're saying you believe in aliens ? Well , you 'd have to be a fool to not believe that in this gigantic universe , there 's no other intelligent life . Believing there 's life elsewhere in the universe is a lot different - than believing your sister was abducted . - Believe what you like . So , when you saw Rebecca , your first instinct was she had been abducted ? No . Of course , not . Your mother brought her to me because she knew I would do what needed to be done . I was discreet . When she first walked in here , she did tell me what your sister had said upon being discovered . She obviously believed her . I had my doubts . That is until I saw Rebecca . - What did you find ? - She had bruises on her arms and legs . As though she had been held down with great force . Now , in a kidnapping situation , this would not seem out of the ordinary . But then I saw the cuts . She had an incision on her torso that was nearly healed when they brought her to me . But with the depth of the cut ... Why , that would be impossible for , for someone only missing a week . - I 've never seen a cut . - She also had a small incision on her palm . Looked as though she 'd been scratching it . I did a scan and discovered a piece of metal under the skin . What was it ? Implant . Tracking device . Who knows ? So the implant is why you believed my mother 's story ? It wasn 't until after I performed the operation and I removed the fetus from her , that I realized your mother was not as crazy as she sounded . - What was wrong with it ? - It was quite ... disfigured . Deformities that I had never seen in all my years practicing medicine . You see , in my line of work , we build a healthy constitution towards the things that make other people uncomfortable . But seeing that ... thing ... That is something that still wakes me in the night . You 're with a child . It is ... my fiance 's . I know what you 're carrying . And you brought that into my house . Please leave now . Fuck ! What am I supposed to do ? Jesus , Calvin ! Where 's Abby ? Abby ... is not home . Where is she ? - I was hoping you could tell me . - I don 't know . I haven 't been here . We got into an argument . Just like old times ? So , what was the fight about ? Did she tell you about the baby ? What about the baby ? It 's not mine . Yeah , that 's how I felt . I might have taken it a little better than you , actually . This can 't be happening . Becca . Where 's the sphere ? I don 't know . Is it with Abby ? Does she have it ? I don 't know , Calvin . I haven 't been here . You know more than you 're telling me . I don 't know where that fucking thing is . Abby got rid of it . It 's gone . You 'll never see it again . I doubt that . We 'll see Abby and the sphere soon . We just have to make them come to us . What are you ... I warned you , Abby . You should have listened to me . Fuck this . Fuck . Rebecca ? Just tell me where you are , and I 'll be right there . - Rebecca can 't really talk right now . - Calvin ? Calvin ? What the hell is going on ? I know about the baby . And I know you have the device . I need you to bring them both to me . - Where 's Rebecca ? - She 's right here . Let me get her for you . Say hi to your big sister . You son of a bitch ! What are you doing to her ? If you don 't bring what they want up to this cabin , I 'm gonna kill her . You wouldn 't . You have no idea what I 'm going through , or what I would do to make it stop . Okay . I 'll leave right now . Good Girl . Abby , don 't call the cops . They 'll know . She 's on her way . You know , this isn 't what I wanted . I love Abby . I was ... so excited when she told me the news ... about the baby . But now it looks like the joke 's on me . I 've seen things . You , Chuck . I know what you 've been through . And I 've seen pieces . I don 't want to see anymore . I don 't know how you made it through all these years . But they 'll come back . For the device . For Abby . Getting you back will just be a bonus . Maybe then ... they 'll leave me alone . Get out of my head ! Oh , my God ! Rebecca , I 'm so ... That 's a good girl , Abby . - Calvin , what the fuck are you doing ? - It 's what I have to do . We shouldn 't have to wait long . - For what ? - They 're coming now . - They 'll take what 's theirs . - And then what ? Calvin , you love me . Is this what you want ? I wanted a family with you . Our family . Calvin , it 's your baby . No . How did you find out you were sterile ? The doctor ... called . Did he really call ? I don 't remember . I think so ... How would they know you were sterile , Calvin ? It 's yours . You want to get rid of it , is that what you want ? It 's not about what I want anymore . I need ... The voices , the pictures , in my mind ... to stop . There 's only one way that happens and I ... I can 't control it . I 'm sorry . But it 's true . Calvin . Please . Let 's go home . Let 's go home . Don 't you fucking touch me , I 'll kill you . I 'm so sorry . No ! Oh , God . Where are you ? Where ? No , no , no . You 're here . You found it . I brought it for you . I brought them . In case he comes back . Did you hear those screams ? He 's not coming back . Well then it 's for his friends . I don 't think that 'll work . Do you have any other suggestions ? Because I feel a lot safer going with a gun . I don 't think we can stop them . There has to be some way . How come they didn 't find me after I left ? God ! Oh , shit . I think they 're already here . Not this time , you fuckers . You didn 't load it ? Oh , we gotta go get the shells . Your baby is healthy , Ms. Powell . Would you like to see him ? Yes . Why is he so quiet ? Why isn 't he crying ? He doesn 't cry , Ms. Powell .

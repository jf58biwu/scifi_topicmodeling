 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... You want juice or are you a milk person ? Know what I 'd really like ? Oh , I do indeed , but falling off the wagon ... May not be the best option . Haven 't seen you around before . Are you new ? Eight years , actually . Just--just a minute . What is this ? Sometimes he forgets we answer to a higher authority . What higher authori- - the Regents . These are the Regents ? This waitress is a Regent ? Who would you have control the Warehouse ? Kings ? Popes ? Politicians ? Be nothing left of it . Mr. Valda , you tell me right to my face . Either fire me or kill me ... Or let me do my job . A missing walking stick ? A stick that causes earthquakes ? Say it . It doesn 't mean that this is it . Oh , it kills you that I figured out one first . Just because the robberies involved ... Earthquakes . What some people reported as earthquakes ... Ah ! And there happens to be a piece missing from a nearby exhibit about an earthquake ... The largest one ever felt in England , a country not known for its earthquakes , by the way . It doesn 't mean that this is the artifact . Chin up , Watson , old Bean . We can 't all be as brilliant as Sherlock Lattimer . Ahem . Hey , Pete ? Yes ? The case is intact and the lock 's not picked . So what , inside job ? Peruse their payroll ? After you . Ooh . Victory lap . Will you get over yourself ? What 's that you say ? Grow up . Ahh . Ooh , ooh ! News flash ! Stop . Bering to admit she was wrong . Stop . Pigs standing by for maiden flight . Stop ! You do see the " do not touch " signs everywhere ? New favorite job perk : Officially allowed to ignore velvet ropes . I 'm on this side . I 'm on this side . I 'm on this side . Hey , Pete . Yeah ? The sign for the stick was still there . Okay ? Well , the museum hasn 't reported a theft . They haven 't noticed it 's gone . He puts it back . When he 's not using it . Whoa ! Oh ! Myka , look out ! Ah ! You okay ? Yeah . Okay . Okay . That way ? I 'm on it . Secret Service . One of your security guards is getting away with a stolen- - you , hold it ! I don 't have time for this . Mrs. Frederic ? It 's no time to explain . This is of the utmost secrecy . You cannot tell Arthur or even Agent Bering . Okay . I want you to throw this mission and let the artifact get away . Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Mrs. Frederic , what is going on ? That 's an order , Mr. Lattimer . I 'll contact you later . Go ! Pete ! Pete , where 's the guy ? I don 't know . I lost him . I thought he was out here , but he 's gone . Guess you can spare some time for us now . ♪ Warehouse 13 2x06 ♪ Around the Bend Original Air Date on August 10 , 2010 Yeah , they 're Secret Service . We 're not gonna press charges . I thought fishing you out of custody would be like old times , Lattimer , but you and your friend are both fully clothed . They catch you too early or too late ? Well , I 've matured since then . I get arrested in my pants all the time now . I 'm guessing you two have met ? Kate Logan , Chicago field office . The cops called us to check out your story . And you heard my name and wanted to see me . You know , I could just vouch for you and we could leave him at the early man exhibit . Awesome . I like her . Hmm . That 's a good one . I didn 't know you transferred to Chicago . I didn 't know you transferred to super-secret South Dakota . Is that a promotion or a punishment ? Yeah , well , it depends on the day . So far , today 's good . Anyway , I got to get back to my case . Ahh , yeah , a stolen walking stick . Defcon Four . Well , it 's part of my new look . You know , top hat , monocle , big stick . Mr. peanut . Very sexy . So , uh , you showing up here means I should call you , right ? Call , don 't call . Same as always . Play date over ? Not if I can help it . Thief 's name is Lenny Malone . Has a sheet--two petty thefts , one assault , and now he 's in the wind . We were in D.C. together . We used to- - it 's clear what you used to . I 'm more interested in what happened here last night . Nothing . I just lost him . You two out of the clutches of the Lakefield Police Department ? Yes , thanks to Pete 's old girlfriend . Yeah , I probably don 't want to know what that means , but consider that the frying pan . Now get back here and brace yourselves for the fire . Hey . So what 's this about a fire ? Agents Bering and Lattimer , back from losing another artifact . Once again involving local police and unauthorized members of the Secret Service . We didn 't lose an artifact . No , no , no , no . I don 't know who you are- - Myka , Myka--guys . This is Benedict Valda . He 's one of the Regents . Our Regents ? The Regents ? No , Pete , the South Dakota college board of Regents . Yes , the Regents . That 's unusual , right ? An in-person visit from a Regent ? Was unusual for the first 30 years that I worked here , but lately , I guess we just can 't be trusted to do our jobs . Mr. Valda could have done all this by courier , not brought my agents back from the field . That 's quite enough , Agent Nielsen . I brought these agents back due to their repeated inability to protect this organization from unwanted scrutiny . The Regents have decided to become more hands-on . Moving forward , you can expect me to be- - all up in our dust traps ? Shh . You , in particular , miss Donovan , should consider yourself on notice . Your inclusion in this group at all is a matter of lively debate . Don 't waste any time on me . I 'm just tech support . Claudia . Yes , you are . Nuh-uh . I got this . Remember what I said . I can input that . I 'll handle it . I want you two back in Illinois . Find that stick . Artie ? Artie ? What 's going on ? Why can 't I see that ? Is there something about me on there ? I cannot believe a Regent was just here and he 's pissed at us . This is probably your fault . I never thought I 'd be in a rush to get back to Lakefield , Illinois . Pete , you coming ? Uh , yeah . I got a thing first . I 'm allowed to have a thing . Okay . You know , it 's a strange time to have a thing . So what 's with all the cloak and dagger ? Keeping secrets from my team really isn 't my thing . Get in . Some of the Regents are concerned about a pattern . Artifacts being used for criminal gain . Like Malone and the walking stick . But that 's not so unusual . It is if it 's someone on the inside . We have every reason to believe that there 's a breach , possibly at a high level . We need your help in finding out who . So if the Regents asked me to throw the case , why was Valda tearing me a new one ? That visit was planned some time ago . Any changes might have alerted our culprit . Whoa , whoa . Look , okay , wait . You can 't be thinking that the breach is Artie or Myka . Have you forgotten recent events ? Could you doubt that anyone could be compromised ? Okay , so then why trust me ? Because keeping secrets from your team really isn 't your thing , which makes you the least likely suspect . Have I chosen poorly ? No , ma 'am . If our hunch is correct , Malone 's supplier will try to approach him for his cut of the take . Go to work as usual . Keep your eye on Malone . If you need to contact me , you break the window at the end . This is strictly between you and me . Understood ? Good . Hey , uh ... So are we , like , friends now ? Right . See ya . What are you hiding from me , Artie ? Schmancy new security measures . I am impressed . But did we remember all temp copies , mirror drives , and image backups ? Silly " wabbit . " Too easy . " Donovan contingencies " ? Cool . I 'm the star of a Ludlum novel . Look , it 's encrypted . That 's so cute . Chomp , chomp , chomp , chomp , chomp , chomp . So you think the cops already tossed it ? No , this looks like Malone grabbed some clothes and ran . Power 's off . Uh ... Are you trying to , you know , pump the electricity up to the light or- - no . Ha-ha ! Geez , God , Myka . Well , is there something down there ? No . It 's nothing . I 'm gonna go check his trash . You keep poking around here . Okay . All right ? Yeah , okay . Valda . Pete ? Pete , where are you ? Someone there ? Pete ? I got him ! I got Malone ! Come on ! Wait a minute . Wait- - wait a minute . I Tesla 'd the guy . He was out cold . Well , was he meeting someone ? Yeah , he was- - I mean , no . I didn 't see anybody else . You 're sure it was Valda ? 1,000 % . Did he see you ? I don 't know . But now we know it 's not Artie or Myka , so let 's bring them in on this . Listen carefully . The Regents have kill authority on anyone deemed a threat to the Warehouse . Telling the others will only put them in harm 's way . Well , then let 's bring this guy down now . Leaping too quickly with someone like Valda will put a bullet in your head . What we need is evidence . Malone and the walking stick . And I need for you to find him first before the police or Agent Bering . I 'll contact those Regents I know I can trust . Patience , Mr. Lattimer . Right , well , I 'm not too good with patience . Challenge yourself . Hey . Hey . Where have you been ? I had a car thing . Wow . You 've been busy . This is everything from Malone 's apartment . You know , something doesn 't add up . Okay , I 'm him , right ? I have ... The walking stick . I mean , why do I go back to the apartment ? Did I stash something else that I need ? Is that the walking stick ? No , Pete . This is a snack . Ah . Mmm . Myka ? Yeah ? Did you check the last number dialed ? No , I didn 't . That 's a good idea . The phone Jack 's over there . Ahem . Pines Place Motel . If he wasn 't meeting anyone else in the apartment , then why was he there ? Yeah , got me . Is there anything ? Nope . The last number dialed was take-out . Huh . I 'm gonna go check his trash . You keep poking around here . I got a thing first . I 'm allowed to have a thing . I lost him . You want to talk about this ? This is why I said leave it alone . Then maybe you shouldn 't have put it on the computer . That 's like me leaving a cake out with a note on it that says , " not for Artie . " That was one time and I- - don 't you have a boyfriend that you could be irritating instead of me ? He dumped me . Oh , I didn 't know . Do you want me to call him ? Artie ! This is a list of ways to kill me . Oh , they 're not ... All killing you . There 's other options here . " Erase her memory " ? Well , that 's comparatively humane . " Drop her in a non-English-speaking country " ? See , they 're just trying to stall for time . They know you 're gonna find your way back . That doesn 't make me feel any better ! Don 't you think that there 's a file like this on all of us ? Don 't you know that there 's one with my name on it ? And are you okay with that ? Claudia ... You are a valued member of this team and no one is gonna erase your memory or dispose of your body in a vat of acid . Is that on here too ? Oh , my God . It 's there ? Yeah . Uh-huh . Number 11 . Artie ? I think Pete 's drinking again . What ? No . What ? No , no , no . What ? We 're just asking because we 're worried about you . Yeah , bro . We 're your friends . Tell me this is some kind of a- - a weird , uncomfortable surprise party . Pete , you 've been acting strange this whole case . You been lying . You 've been making up excuses to be alone . Look , your hands are shaking . For crying out loud , you- - you- - I 'm sorry . You guys , this is sweet , really , but you 're wrong , okay ? You 're wrong . In eight years , I haven 't even had a virgin daiquiri . Then what ? I 'm not drinking . That was quick . Secrets are a naughty thing , Peter . You listen up , Valda . Look behind the tree in front of you . Valda- - you two have been busy little bees . She 'll never see your signal , by the way . Where is she ? She 's alive . I have a man watching her through the scope of a rifle . I need you to tie up one loose end for me . Oh , yeah ? And what 's that ? Mr. Malone . Where is he ? No , no , first , you call your man off Mrs. Frederic . I 'm afraid not . When I call you again , be ready to deliver Malone . Now how do I know you won 't kill her anyway ? You 're in no position to quibble , Peter . I could kill your whole team . Hey ! The others don 't know anything ! Okay ? You leave them out of this . That 's entirely up to you . Are we clear ? Here 's what 's clear , pal . You tell me I have something you want and then you threaten my friends . So you are going down . Game on . Game on ! ♪ ♪ He 's not at the BB . His cell goes straight to voicemail . He 's taking himself off the grid . He left this . Agent Kate Logan . Pete Lattimer . Damn it . Okay , uh , tell her I need an address for a Benedict Valda . V-a-l-d-a . Thanks . Lakefield . Pines Place Motel . Hey , buddy boy . Remember me ? I 'm the guy from the museum you tried to kill with the battle Axe . Now how do I find Benedict Valda ? Who ? Valda ! Ah ! The guy you met in the alley . Or should I hand you over to him like he wants ? I don 't know any Valda . Okay , all right , look . I took the stick from the exhibit . I admit it . You 're working together . I saw you paying him off . Look , you 're crazy , man . No , no ! Okay . Where is it ? It 's under the bed . It 's right under the bed . Hey ! Hey ! Hey , handsome . What can I get you ? You feeling all right ? Um , yeah . It 's just a long night . That 's all . Thank God . Hey . Coffee ? Maybe you should stick with decaf ? That 's a good idea . Two , please . Coming up . Okay , first , that message was the least-romantic Booty call ever . What is with this Valda character ? Why ? Why ? Did something happen ? Guy doesn 't exist on paper , but ever since I poked , my place was trashed , my phone 's been bugged , and someone 's been tailing me . When I find that S.O.B. , I am gonna- - don 't worry . I 'm a big girl , but someone 's definitely sending a message . Either that or you 've gone way too far making up an excuse to see me . No . It isn 't me . You 're still hot , but not " trash your place just to get a date " hot . It 's happened . I 'm sure . Okay , then ... Think it 's time you let me in . What 's the division you 're working for ? Well , let 's just say I 'm in containment of threats . To the President ? To the planet . Okay , okay . Right . I know . I know . I know it sounds like I 'm wearing a tinfoil hat to keep the aliens from stealing my thoughts , but , Kate , I 'm serious . I can 't tell you what I do . Thanks . Ahh . So Valda , how does he fit in ? He 's way up the food chain , and bad . Like , Keyser Soze bad . I don 't think this is decaf . Okay , how are you supposed to find him ? When he came to visit us ... He had a driver and a limo . So they had to get gas , right ? Maybe he used a credit card or , you know , got themselves on camera . You 're going to check every gas station , restaurant , and rest stop for 100 miles ? Where I work , there 's only , like , six . Still a lot of legwork . Look , if your partner and everyone you worked with had their lives threatened , wouldn 't you do it ? Yeah . Thanks for dragging me into your fun world . I thought you were happy to see me . I kind of liked you better when you were helpless , pantsless Pete . Well , the pants are imminently removable . What ? I honestly had no idea this is where my day was headed . Everyone 's hands where I can see ' em ! Logan , get out of here . What ? Myka , what the hell are you doing ? What am I doing ? You 've gone AWOL . You 've stolen an artifact and you won 't tell anyone what 's going on . What am I supposed to think ? Mrs. Frederic can explain it . Mrs. Frederic is missing . Valda is calling the shots and he thinks you had something to do with it . Myka , Valda is the guy I 'm after . If Mrs. Frederic is missing , then he either has her or she is dead . Look , all I know is I have my orders . Don 't make me do this the hard way , Pete . Ah ! Come on ! Pete , do not get in that car ! Pete , please ! Hands on the wheel ! Hey , Myka ! Myka , put the gun away and we 'll talk , okay ? You have no idea what Valda is capable of ! Pete , just come with me and we 'll sort this out , okay ? Lattimer , get in the car ! Logan , please ! I 'm just trying to keep you alive , okay ? Take the shot . Take the shot ! No ! Oh , my God . Kate . Pete ! Wait . Excuse me , ma 'am . Ma 'am , you c- - it 's all right . Kate , Pete 's in trouble . Pete 's stuck in some sort of paranoid delusion . The way that he ran . The note . He thinks that someone is out to get him . We don 't have any of the details yet , but we think that he was affected by , um ... . Something during a mission . Right . Your " secret " missions . Why come to me ? Well , one , he called you , so whatever 's going on in his head , you must be a part of it and ... Two ... Well ... He 's back on your turf . We pulled this off a Chicago city surveillance Cam . Yeah . What is he doing ? I think he thinks that he 's kissing you . Uh-huh ? But it could be you though , right ? It 's highly doubtful . My money 's on you . Um , he left you a message ? Yeah , it was weird . Here . So why is he fixated on Valda ? I think his mind is scrambling together details from his life the way you do when you 're dreaming . He 's constructing some kind of fantasy with Valda and Malone , the walking stick . Well , could this walking stick have caused it ? It didn 't affect Malone . No , I think whatever this is , it started in that museum . Did Pete touch anything while you were there ? Artie , it 's Pete . It would be easier to list the things that he didn 't touch . Oh , God . Okay , show me . Okay , he played with , um , some of these billiard balls . Myka , Myka , what else ? What else ? What else ? Then he played with these glasses and this pipe . Why did you let him touch all those things ? What am I , his kindergarten teacher ? Plus , you know , we didn 't know there would be two artifacts in the same place . Myka , it 's a museum . It is filled with things from historical events . Anything there could be an artifact . You cannot let him touch anything . Artie , it 's Pete , okay ? It 's a win when he doesn 't lick anything . Yes , what else ? All right , fine . All right , he put this thing in his ear . That 's a good way to get an infection if you ask me , but ... Yeah . Then he- - oh , he clicked this telegraph , then- - oh , right , then he- - wait , wait , wait . What ? Telegraph ? Go back . Go back . Go back . Show me the telegraph . Here you go . It 's military . 1860s . Telegraph Island , Oman . Telegraph Island ? Oh , my . Wait , wait , wait . I know that . That sounds familiar . Myka , wait . Wait one second . All right . Telegraph Island . A remote outpost between England and India in the mid-1800s . Reported that every- - every soldier posted there went violently insane . Well , that- - it sounds " artifacty , " right ? You think ? No , wait . It hasn 't affected anyone since . Well , is this it or not ? Only one way to find out . Pete , it 's Myka . Just tell me that you can hear me . Yeah . Yeah , I can hear you . I just don 't know what to say to you . I keep--I keep telling myself it wasn 't our fault . And I couldn 't say anything to you , because I was trying to protect you . I 'm here , Pete . I 'm safe . Got Katie killed . What ? No , no , Pete . Kate 's- - Kate 's alive , okay ? I just left her . Pete , you 've been affected by an artifact , the telegraph . I think you 're hallucinating . Valda 's filled your head with lies . But I 'm about to fix all that . So you , and Leena , Artie , Claudia , you guys will all be safe . Pete , no , okay ? Don 't do whatever it is you 're about to do . Okay ? You might feel something strange . Anything ? I 've been listening , Peter . Valda ? Pete , did you hear what I just said ? Where 's Myka ? Now you 've compromised the others . Do you realize what I 'll have to do ? Valda , I 'll trade you Malone for Mrs. Frederic . I don 't know how to reach you . You meet me at the Kemper recycling yard . Hey , boss . There 's no effect . He 's still inside of whatever 's going on . At least now we know where he 's going . And I think I have just the thing to restore Pete 's neural rhythm . Agent Lattimer ! I understand you want to speak with me . What in God 's name- - shut up . I 've heard enough of your voice to last a lifetime . I don 't know what this is all about , Agent Lattimer , but you have my attention . All right ? You recognize this ? It appears to be the artifact that you were after , the walking stick . " It appears to be the- - the artifact you 're after . " Shut up ! We 're all alone out here , Valda . Quit playing the game . I got the stick , I got Malone , and I got you . Now what did you do with Mrs. Frederic ? Mrs. Frederic ? Look , I want to help you . But none of this can be- - oh , yeah , yeah . Yeah , yeah ! Myka tried that line on me . She was a good little soldier . She fed me your garbage about a telegraph that 's making me see things . Telegraph ? Time is running out , Benedict . Telegraph . What do you remember ? Is there anything unusual about it ? Think ! Just stop trying to confuse me ! I 'm not confusing you . You 're seeing clearly . Try to remember . I said shut up ! Pete ! Agent Bering . Be careful . Myka ! Look , this is gonna sound kinda freaky , but ... Are you guys really here ? 'Cause Valda 's been messing with my head , and I don 't know what 's real anymore . Yeah , we 're really here . Okay ? Pete ? And we 're gonna help you get outta this . Oh , they 're here , Peter . Almost ready . You really think I 'd come here without backup ? Myka , you and Artie , you gotta get outta here . He 's got- - he 's got snipers all over the place . Where is Mrs. Frederic ? Artie . Agent Nielsen ! I am aware of the urgency . I 've got something that 'll reset his neural rhythm- - the original studio master of Oye Como Va . Music to die by , hey , Peter ? Just stop it ! You stop ! Ahh ! Okay , listen to me , Pete . I really need you to not do that again , okay ? The irony is Myka 's gonna kill you for me . She has to protect the Regent . And then I 'll kill them before your body 's even cold . This music is just not getting through . He 's still listening to that telegraph . Myka , he wants to kill us all . You and Artie just get outta here ! Agent Nielsen ! Yeah , I 'm- - I 'm working on it . You back off ! You hear me ? You back off or I 'll kill him ! I 've got to find something that can- - I 've got it . Okay , Pete , I 'm gonna come over there , and you 're gonna give me your gun , okay ? Here it comes , Peter . Stop ! ♪ ♪ Pete ? Pete ? Pete ?

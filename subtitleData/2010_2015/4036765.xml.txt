 Previously on Caprica ... Some time off world would be very healthy . I never expected this path to lead here . Look ... The STO recruits . The ones that failed . Holy frak . I 'm not sure how much longer I can keep living this lie . Who 's the biggest problem right now ? Mar-Beth . She pretty much runs the place . - Oh , my God . - Are you spying on Clarice ? I can 't let them catch me eavesdropping again . They will kill me . I need the jackets for any and all CIs you have in the field . She 's a good asset . She 's placed inside Clarice Willow 's house . Listen carefully . I 'm about to tell you something that 's going to upset you . If Clarice Willow is who I think she is , then we could take down the entire STO . I will do whatever it takes to honor the soil and protect my family . Why do you follow this particular guatrau ? He is selling cylons for profit to the STO , and he knows the difference one unit would make for the resistance on Tauron . I can help you . The guatrau will never know . If we 're gonna go up against the guatrau , we 're gonna have to do it together . V-World is a depraved cesspool of sin , and I 'm going to clean it up . - I can 't believe he found us . - How ? Zoe . Zoe , wait . Wait ! This avenging angels thing , they must be talking about it in the real world . We 're gods in here . Let 's act like it and forsake these motherfrakkers . I will find my daughter again in V-World and take her home . - Zoe 's alive . - I want to see her . Well , let 's go find her . Our fortress is complete , Tamara . It 's paradise . Almost . I think it needs one more thing . How 's that ? It 's raw data . The digital architecture of New Cap City . - How 'd you get in ? - When I developed the holoband tech , I included backdoor access to any virtual worlds created within it . My eyes are everywhere . There . Whenever she manipulates code to alter the fabric of the game , it leaves a trail . That was them . That was them . Okay , I 'm going in first . I don 't think that 's ... I slapped her the day before she died . She 'll remember that , right ? Well , she 'll remember whatever original Zoe allowed her to remember . Probably ... Yes . She said I 'd regret it for the rest of my life . I did worse . I , uh ... - What ? - I suspected she was hiding in the U-87 , so I tried to flush her out by exploiting her fear of fire . I know , I know . I wasn 't thinking clearly . I 'm sorry . Zoe 's avatar knows how to hide . But with this program I think ... Got ya . - Maybe this is gonna be ... - Zoe ! - Help . - Tamara ! Zoe ! Zoe ? Can you take her a message ? - Let me go . - I will . - Please , just let me go . - You 're in no danger . I promise . Please , I just need to speak to my daughter . - Just let me go , please . - Please , can you take me to her ? Hi , dad . Oh ... Thank the gods . There 's only one . What ? What ? Oh , gods ! Daniel . Daniel ... What happened ? She 's still mad . She shut me out . She shut me out . If I want to get back in the game , I can only go in through an established portal . See , I 'm not really a gamer . New Cap City 's a game with only one rule ... If you die , you can never get back in . Ever . One life . There are no hacks and no workarounds . - Unless you 're Daniel Graystone . - No , she ... She just took that away . So now I 'm stuck playing by the same rules as everyone else . I 'm sorry . They say our children have nothing to teach us . - Sweetheart ... - Well ... Now is not the time for a little ... - What ? - Lesson . Sorry . But maybe ... You know , this is meant to be , Daniel . Maybe we 're supposed to work for this . I think you 've been spending a little too much time with Clarice Willow . Maybe . I wish I had her certainty . Excuse me . Everything okay ? Yeah . What ? If we 're gonna do this thing with Zoe ... We 've gotta get rid of the secrets , right ? I have told you everything . I haven 't . You told him ? He was right beside me when I got your text . I ... Look , I can only lie to so many people at once . Where have you been ? - You disappeared . - I was burned at the GDD . Okay , you 're scaring me . Amanda , the GDD has been compromised at the highest level . We 're on our own . - Am I in danger ? - No . One of the last things I did was to make sure you were protected . Tell me what 's going on at the Willow house . Mar-Beth abandoned her baby . What about the bug I gave you ? Did you catch her on the holoband ? No . They got it locked up in the attic , I think . Something about Mar-Beth leaving spooked them . They 're being extra careful . This is the same model as Clarice 's , but I 've had it rigged . I need you to go back in there . - No . - Please ... Amanda , I need you to go back in there . I need you to switch the holoband . Bring me back the original . I 've got a guy that can hack it . Please . Something is happening , and it 's happening soon . Honestly , it 's the last arrow we 've got . You be careful . Final analysis of the structural stress points is complete . And we have a fake repair crew going around the stadium . They 're planting supplemental charges . We have martyrs placed all throughout the stadium . We have a family of four right down there , for instance . No one would ever suspect them . Now , at the end of the countdown , they 'll set off the initial blast . That will then set off the supplemental charges , creating a chain reaction ... And boom . The explosion will remote-activate the Zoe Graystone program . The scanned avatars of our martyrs will be uploaded to our V-World heaven . The rest is up to the spin doctors . When do the press releases go out ? 30 days , I think . Give people a chance to mourn and to bury their dead . It 's important , though , that the miracle conveys a sense of buoyancy , of joy . The servants of the one true God lifted to paradise in a grand apotheosis . I hope this is what God wants . What ? Of course it is . I mean , every time I go into that holoband demonstration , it just does not feel right . I mean ... A lot of good people are gonna die . Nothing good comes without sacrifice . - They 're martyrs . It 's an honor . - Is it ? Because ... They 're not actually going to heaven . Their scanned avatars are . And with the push of a button , I could transfer them all ... Right now . The death of the original , it 's ... It 's just showmanship . It 's ... It 's totally irrelevant . It 's relevant to God . How can anyone truly know the mind of God , Clarice ? How do we really know you speak for him ? I don 't know . Why don 't you ask him yourself ? I 've squirreled away a few extra tickets to the big game . Are you ready to die for your faith ? Thought so . This is not a mortar . This is a mortar bomb . If you 're old enough to kill people , you 're old enough to know the right words to describe how you did it . Now , the mortar is extremely well-suited ... - Soldier , you failed to salute . - ... for short distances 500 to 1,700 meters . Especially when you 're trying to get over an obstacle . Like barricades , or in the trenches . What 's Lexon doing ? Now once you 've learned to fire one of these mortars , - compensate for drift ... - Frak you , man ! - And successfully hit a target . - On your knees ! We 're going to get to the real fun . - He 's gonna get himself killed . - Don 't get involved . Eyes front ! We are all gonna take our turn - at muzzle loading . - What are you gonna do , huh ? - Robot , shoot this man ! - We 're going to show you how to arm them and detonate them without taking off too many fingers in the process . We will be firing a half-load charge at a target . Stop . - Soldier Rand ! - Stop ! By your command . Rand ! - Rand , get your ass back here ! - Robot , resume ! - Robot , resume . - Stop ! By your command . Robot ... Resume . Robot , resume ! Robot , resume ! Robot , resume ! Resume ! What do you have to say for yourself ? Permission to speak freely . Look , I 'm sorry I broke ranks . But your guard was about to kill Lexon . And I 'm glad he didn 't . Lexon 's a good soldier . But discipline must be maintained above all . It 's what you 're here to learn . I don 't see how murdering Lexon over a stupid fight teaches anybody anything . I did say " speak freely . " What happened to inspiring people to fight for what 's right ? I 'll tell you what , Lacy Rand , when you 're in charge , you can run things your way . I 'll remember that . How did you get that robot to stop ? I don 't know . I just told it to . Are you aware that it is impossible for a U-87 to respond to anyone except an authorized controller ? Maybe he has a sense of decency . Got a light ? Fidelia Fazekas . What the frak ... Come here ! You look like skor . I 've seen you look better . - How 'd you get out ? - Probation . Too many terrorists , nowhere to put ' em . Cap City max is bouncing the small-timers to make room . My tax dollars at work . Heard you got a bump from the old man . - Yeah . That should have been yours . - You 've done good for the guatrau . I hear Yosef got his ink . Running this new Graystone operation . It 's been healthy for him . You know , take his mind off things . Yeah . You heard about Shannon and Tamara , right ? I wish them safe journey . Listen , Fiddy , uh ... I 'm sorry about how the skor went down . You know , when you got convicted , a lot of us took it hard ... Especially Yosef . That 's big of you to say . Hey , hey-hey , hey , hey ! Anyway ... I 'm excited to be working alongside the famous Adama boys . Yeah . You gonna be around for a while ? The joke 's a lot funnier when it 's a joke , Fiddy . You 've gotta stop showing up here . If the guys figure out I 'm protecting you , this deal is off . Tamara is alive in V-World . - She 's with my daughter . - What are you talking about ? Yosef saw her die . No , she can 't die . At least not in the way that you and I think of it . They are holed up together , deep inside the game . To reach them , I need a fighter . I only have one shot at this , - and it 's far too dangerous to go alone . - What do you think , I 'm hired muscle or something ? Now , your company 's got private security detail . - Why don 't you go waste their time ? - I have to keep it quiet , and the world already thinks that Zoe 's a terrorist . She is a frakking ' terrorist ! I 've heard all this from your brother . Do you want your niece back or not ? Back how ? I 've been working on improved design models for a mechanical body for Zoe . Artificial skin . And given enough time , I should be able to devise a believable simulacrum ... No , no ... You listen to me , you sick frak ! Tammy 's dead , returned to the soil in reality , and in my brother 's heart . And that thing has nothing to do with her . - It is her . - No , it 's not her ! It 's her . They are both real . It shouldn 't be true , but it is . Please , I ... I need to get my family back . Please . Good work . Now go home and keep your head low . And I want you to stay away from Clarice . Your husband too , no matter what . You 've gotta promise me that . What are you not telling me ? Mar-Beth is dead . In order to protect you , I fed false information . They thought they were killing a spy . You got an innocent woman killed . Hardly innocent . - She just had a baby . - Oh , please ! That baby 's gonna grow up and become a terrorist , just like the rest of her family . You 've done a great service for the people of Caprica . You 've done a great service for the people of Caprica . Oh , my ... Oh , my gods . Oh , my gods . Oh , my gods . - Dried noodles ? - Yeah . - You believe this ? - What ? - You don 't make your own noodles ? - No . What , you make your own noodles ? Do I make my own noodles ? Stand back and prepare to be amazed . Give me the flour . I 'm serious , give me the flour . - Okay . - Hey . - Hey , Ruth . Hey , Evelyn . - Some eggs . - Where 'd you get that shirt ? - From school . I traded it . Avenging angels . Pretty sick , eh ? - Take it off . - Why ? - Take off the shirt . - Why ? - Take the gods damn shirt off ! - No . Take off this frakkin ' shirt right now ! Don 't you ever bring skor like this into the house . You understand me ? Not a word to your dad , either . Get out of here . Go ! Come on ! I 'll get rid of that . You can 't destroy all the shirts . These avenging angels are everywhere . Sarno makes jokes about them . - Sooner or later , Joseph is going to notice . - What do you want to do , Evelyn ? - You want to give up ? - No . I want you to take Graystone up on his offer . I want you to go into the game ... - Find the Tamara avatar , and kill it . - Graystone says it can 't die . Fine . Then you bury it . You weigh it down with virtual weights , put it into a virtual lake ! Joseph needs to be rid of the dead things in his life . He needs to move on . Yeah , move on to you . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , Ev . We 'll do this , okay ? We ... I promise we 'll keep him safe . Okay . Well ... Sam told me you were back . No . No , no , no , no . We 're not picking up where we left off , I see . - That was a mistake . - Really ? Come on , I was married . Not anymore you 're not . Sorry . How 'd you get in here , anyway ? All access . Like a concert . Been here a while , actually . Really ? Looking into some stuff for the guatrau . What , has he got you checking up on me ? Just getting me up to speed . I didn 't think it would be interesting , but it really is . You know , I keep finding things I don 't understand , and then , like ... Two hours later , I 'm suddenly ... " Oh ! " , you know ? Yeah , well , business is big . It 's , uh ... It 's very complicated . Well , like , right now I 've got this puzzle . Looks to me like two in every two dozen or so robots isn 't making it to the military . I mean , we were skimming some for the STO and Gemenon , but - not that many . - Right , right . I noticed that too . But I 'm told that the ... Robot skeleton requires levels of performance that are right at the edge of the specs that the suppliers can meet . So ... About 1 in 25 don 't pass our standards . Oh , okay . I didn 't notice any records of faulty skeletons being returned . No , we sell them to the reclamation company to be melted down . That explains it ... Mostly . Mostly ? See , this is what 's wrong with me . I ... I see something like this , and I have to make the math work out . And you 're not getting paid for that amount of reclaimed metal . Well , there 's ... Non-metal components that get stripped off . Of course . Yes . Look , if you think there 's something going on ... I don 't . No , no , come out and say it . - I mean , what 's going on here ? - Don 't worry , counselor . 90 % of the time it 's somebody putting a decimal point in the wrong place . Nobody 's gonna get in trouble here . Especially not you . The guatrau trusts you . More than you know . You 'll be fine , I promise . You do look good . This is torture . Just hold your breath . Come on . Move . Just a little move . Like this ? Oh , frak ! Brain on fire . Thank you . Holo-porn ? Yes , as a matter of fact . - What business is it of yours ? - It 's contraband . Are you looking to get yourself shot ? You 're just bossing everybody around today . First the robot , now me . Shut up and get dressed . I need your eyes . Why ? Okay . I just need to go inside . Let me know if someone comes . Unbelievable . Robots ... Power up . You 're the one , aren 't you ? Raise your arm . Robot , lower your arm . Unbelievable . Zoe ... Are you in there ? We should go . If you 're in there , I need you to let me know . Lacy ... Raise your arm if you 're Zoe . Zoe ? Please . Zoe , I ... I need you . Okay , we 're going now . Lacy , let 's go . Have a seat . So ... Who the frak is Zoe ? What , you don 't trust me ? Suit yourself . What is that ? Coto . Zoe was my friend . She died . - And ? - And it 's hard to explain . This 'll help . I don 't need it . Tell me when you 're ready . Hello . Zoe Graystone was a true believer in God 's grace . An inspiration . She was my friend , and I loved her . Wait . Graystone ? That 's the Zoe we 're ... That 's kind of interesting . We can talk all about it if you want . Later , maybe . Good . Daniel , Samuel Adama is on the phone for you . Put him through . What can I do for you , Sam ? I had a change of heart about this New Cap City thing . - I see . Can I ask why ? - Yeah . I put a lot of my own cash into the war effort . Made a few bets that didn 't pan out , you know ? - How much do you need ? - 10,000 . 8,000 . - Seriously . - All right , 10,000 . - But we go tonight . - You 're the boss . I 'll get you the settings and times . Off . Probably should have asked for more . - Does he suspect ? - No . In Graystone 's world , people will do just about anything for money . You live very rustically ... Don 't you ? Well , I suppose if you like it that way . This girl , Lacy Rand , she was sent to us by Clarice Willow . Said girl exerts unexplained control over war machines we bought on the black market . - This is troubling . - Only if you try to explain it . I 'm sorry , mother , I don 't understand . Secrets have answers . Now , mysteries ... They don 't have answers . That 's why I love them . They 're full of endless possibilities and ... Permutations like God himself . But if you solve a mystery , what are you left with ? - A secret . - Exactly . So ordinary . You know , our training is so harsh ... - I , uh - I worry about the children . All that fooling around with the weapons and ... Dangerous chemicals and explosives . It 's a wonder any of them ... Make it through our program alive . Noble Farasa 's ring ? You know what needs to be done . I 'll see to it . Is he going to be all right ? Yeah , he was stable when I left the E.R. Luckily , Cottle was practitioner on duty . He will keep it quiet . I 'm so sorry , sweetheart . I 'm sorry . I 'm the one that got us into this mess . No , you just did what you had to do . Serge , get the GDD on the line . - No . Cancel that . - Why ? Duram said specifically not to . Gods , they 're probably the ones that shot him . Okay , do ... Do you want me to try to hack the holoband for you ? No . It was missing when I got back . Shooter probably took it . Well , then , what , sweetheart , we just wait ? I 'll lose my mind . I want to see her . Well ? You 're right . All static . Can you fix it ? Sure . Just have to scrub the drive and reinstall every ... - Hold on a second . - What ? I think this e-number is wrong . What , you know my e-number off the top of your head ? Photographic memory . Yeah , it 's a curse , really . I remember every syllable of every self-righteous speech you 've ever given . Yeah , I 'm right . These numbers don 't match up . But that 's not possible . Are you sure you wrote it down ? Clarice ... This isn 't your band . Am ... Amanda ... Graystone . - She took it . - No , she wouldn 't know how . Frak ! She 's the one that 's been spying on us the whole time . There must be a perfectly rational explanation about ... You stupid , stupid woman ! You just watch your mouth . Everything is on that band . Apotheosis , our time tables . Information on our agents , on us . The GDD 's been playing us the whole time . We don 't know that . That means ... Mar-Beth . Mar-Beth was innocent ? The mother of our child . And you cut her throat ! - Frak ! - Let me just think . - Oh , my ... - Just trying to think . All right , we have 24 hours until the explosion . And that is more ... Than enough time to find Amanda ... To find the band before they hack it , and to get heaven back . And what do we do about Graystone ? I just want to talk to her . You ready ? Yeah . They 're here . I can feel it . Are you okay ? Oh , yeah . Let them come .

 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... I have cancer . [ Sobbing ] You are the Count of St. Germain ! An alchemist used a stone to keep my body from aging . - Myka ! - Uhh ! Sir ? My lying , cheating husband is once again out in the world . But I have plans too . A 15-year-old boy ? Nick Powell . Why don 't you come back to South Dakota with us ? - Is everything all right ? - I 'm in , aren 't I ? Nick broke into the Warehouse and released one of the Bronze Sector prisoners . - A guy named Paracelsus . - The alchemist ! He destroyed the bronzer . And look ... this is Claudia . [ Groans softly ] [ Distant ] Fourscore and seven years ago ... [ Hitler shouting , crowd cheering ] I have a dream ... One giant leap for mankind . Tear down this wall . Uhh ! [ Panting ] It 's brilliant . [ Panting ] I understand now . Thank you for freeing me , Nicholas . The centuries ... pass slowly when you are encased in bronze . Mother and I have tried many times to free you , but ... No one knows better than I what an inconvenience the Warehouse can be . But no longer . We only ask one thing in return . Ah . I would have thought immortality was trade enough . We 've been ageless for far too long , uncle . Ah . We want--I- - I have to live out my life . Nothing can be done until we are ... All right , I 'm sorry , but I can 't read lips . I can 't see . How can there be nothing in the system about why Paracelsus was bronzed ? I don 't know , I just figure he 's some kind of Lex Luthor , Joker , Dr. Doom mash-up . I mean , the Warehouse only bronzed the baddest of the baddies . HG wasn 't a baddie . Well , yeah , now , but she did try and blow up the world , which is the number one criteria for an arch-nemesis . Pete , look at this . Sutton 's ring , Genghis Khan 's mace , and a bunch of other artifacts are missing . Yeah , I 'm just gonna stick with supervillain mash-up . [ Crash ] Hey ! Don 't break her . Yeah , thank God you said that , because , you know , breaking her , that was our big plan . - You fixed it ? - Just be glad that they didn 't destroy this whole thing . So why do you think they took her out of there ? Were they gonna try and bronze someone else ? I don 't know . You know who might know ? You , if you keep using the durational spectrometer . We also may be able to figure out where they went . Okay , yeah , we 're just , uh ... Okay . Ohh . Don 't need lips to read that . We 're ready to go . Let 's give this a try . [ Air lock hisses ] [ Buzzer ] Uh--uh , that didn 't work , Artie , she 's still- - I can see that . Just need to reset . [ Beep ] [ Buzzer ] [ Whooshing ] [ Buzz buzz ] It 's probably just , you know , a loose wire . Something electronic , or could be something far worse . Artie , what is it ? - Yeah , it 's gone . - What 's gone ? The artifact that makes this bronzer work . It 's a bronze Mesopotamian stele from 1250 BC , and , no , we do not have another one . So then how do we unbronze Claudia ? Artie , what is that ? [ Sniffs ] Judging from the smell , I 'd say it was a chemical reaction triggered by light when I opened this panel . What the hell ? It 's a message from Paracelsus . Sutton 's involved . Why doesn 't that surprise me ? So Paracelsus has the bronzer stele and he 's holding it till he gets whatever it is his son has . Yeah , that 's not a message . It 's a ransom note . [ Eerie music ] You know , there 's really no reason to restrain me like this . I 'm not going anywhere . This thing chafes . The Folsom Prison ball and chain is attached to your shadow , not your person . It doesn 't chafe . But you 're absolutely right . You 're not going anywhere . No more games . Where 's Paracelsus and your son ? I don 't know . They weren 't supposed to leave . Yeah , well , he bronzed our friend , so forgive us for not believing you . But that was not part of the plan . Nicholas liked to Claudia . You know what , lady , I 'm- - You know what ? What if ... Nick bronzed Claudia against his will ? Paracelsus did slap him pretty hard . Paracelsus struck my son ? In your urgency to free Paracelsus , you neglected to factor in one volatile element . Paracelsus ! But that 's why Nick had the gun . I told him not to underestimate ... [ Sighs ] I should have unbronzed Paracelsus . My cell . - Password . - Year I was born , 1502 . I would have guess 1508 . What 's your secret ? Oil of Olay ? No messages . Call him . Speed dial is " N. " Seriously- - pilates , sunscreen . Straight to voicemail . Something 's happened . Paracelsus made plans of his own . Now he 's got two hostages . Why don 't we start with this ? Why did you get involved with the most dangerous rogue alchemist in history ? Paracelsus was--is- - Sutton 's brother . As you know , he had a rather heretical approach to , well , pretty much everything . Pushed the boundaries of science , often combining that science with artifacts . Multiple artifacts . Just a few moments . Step into the chamber . By your command , dear brother . The wine ... You 've drugged me . Why ? I was already playing your guinea pig for a reasonable fee . What the hell is my family doing here ? Have you lost your mind ? Uhh ! This was only supposed to be me ! Let them go . You don 't need them . Oh , but you 're wrong , my dear brother , I do . I must test my theory on a man , a woman , and a child . How else would I determine whether gender or age alter the process or the result ? I 'll see that your fee is tripled . [ Grunting ] [ Sizzling ] And you woke up immortal ? Paracelsus combined the philosopher 's stone with another artifact . With a copper bowl with the Egyptian symbol for life . That 's as dangerous as replacing gunpowder with nuclear fission . So what happened next ? Not long after , Paracelsus disappeared . And we later found out that agents from Warehouse 9 had taken him . And they bronzed him . Why ? No idea . I 've watched my son trapped in an endless adolescence of broken hearts . The first was the most painful . Her name was Sophia . They were just two 15-year-olds in love . What could be more natural ? Nick stayed 15 , and ... Sophia grew up . She married , she had children , and she forgot all about he first love . But Nick never forgot her . That was the first time that I saw the cruelty of immortality . Centuries caught between child and man . Never to fall in love , raise a family , share your life with someone . And worse , watching your loves age and die . He knows only loss . But the heart is strong , and it takes a long time to give up hope . Nick fell in love again ... and again , until finally he understood there would be no one to love for all eternity . That 's why you want mortality for your son ? But the philosopher 's stone isn 't enough , is it ? You need Paracelsus to reverse it . And he 's got to use the same mixture of artifacts and elements he did the first time . You unbronzed him , even though you knew he was dangerous . We assumed that he would be weak after all that time , and grateful . I mean , some things are worth risking everything for , and my son is one of them . Artie , I 'm assuming that Paracelsus is gonna try to use the stone on himself . Where would Paracelsus find those specific elements ? We assumed in his laboratory in Constantinople . Istanbul today . Call me crazy , but after 500 years , I 'm gonna bet that it 's been made into condos by now . Well , we have to try . Where , exactly , in Istanbul ? We were drugged when we were taken there . Deep underground somewhere . Well , we can 't just go digging holes all over Istanbul . Wait a minute- - Paracelsus message said , " Sutton knows what I want . " If Sutton knows what Paracelsus wants ... Then Sutton would know where to find him . Any idea where you husband is ? Oh , I 've given up keeping track of Sutton after Napoleon put a price on his head . It 's just too dangerous . [ Computer bleeping ] [ Keyboard clacking ] [ Slaps desk ] Come on ! The old boy 's been in there for , like , 11 hours . Well , you know , it takes time . Needle in a haystack . Maybe he needs some help . Really ? You gonna- - you gonna put your hand in the lion 's cage ? - No , no ! No ! No ! - Good point . [ Laughs ] So , while we 're at it , why don 't we , uh ... Why don 't we talk about why you haven 't started your treatments yet ? - What treatments ? - Like , uh , your cancer treatments , which you should have started , like , yesterday . Look , that 's why I didn 't tell anyone about this , okay ? This is- - this is my disease . And it 's my treatment program , and I will start it when I 'm good and ready to start it . You 're really telling me how to handle my own body . No , it 's just--you can 't just handle cancer . Look , I got this under- - I got it ! Yeah , I got it . I got it . The system has been maddeningly slow . But using Sutton 's last known whereabouts , which was Paris , I started with Interpol , and then video from Charles De Gaulle Airport . - And then I widened the net . - Artie Uh , long story short- - the count is posing as a Russian businessman named Vladimir Kamenev . - Natter Weekly ? - Yes , Natter Weekly . It 's utterly reliable . How do you think we found Jimmy Hoffa ? - Really ? - [ Mutters gibberish ] Okay , the count is in Luxembourg , and Natter says that he is quite chummy with an incredibly rich duchess . According to Natter , the duchess is throwing an elaborate dinner party , so dust off your formalwear and off to Luxembourg you go . Take Charlotte with you . - Wait , Charlotte ? - Yes , Charlotte ! Charlotte knows her husband better than anyone . Just keep an eye on her . Go , go , go , go . Okay . [ Machinery hissing and clanking ] [ On PA ] Artie , get down to the Bronze Sector now ! - I think she 's getting worse . - Worse than bronzed ? Yeah . The Farnsworth , it 's crumbling . - And that 's not normal . - Right . No , the bronzer , it was build to stabilize the stele artifact and create a bronze state for the prisoners ... would remain alive and ... That 's why we didn 't find her inside the bronzer . Paracelsus must have bronzed her outside the machine using just a stele . What does that mean ? Her bronze state is unstable . And if we don 't find the artifact or find a way to reverse Claudia 's disintegration , the eventually , she 's- - she 's just gonna ... crumble away . Lots of bronze files . We 've got bronze age , bronze era , bro- - could you ... Bronze- - phosphor bronze , arsen--arsen- - what the hell ? Come on . Get ... Okay , bronze color , bronze properties , - bronze compo- - - I-I got this , all right ? Oh , you 've got this ? There 's like a gazillion files that have something to do with bronze or- 6,083 files . - Well , 6,083 files that you can 't get through alone . I don 't plan to get through them alone . What I plan to do is use an algorithm- - Artie . Mrs. Frederic . You 're here . Yes , I am . Mrs. Frederic ? Yes , Arthur ? Why are you here ? There 's something here . There 's something ... off . Yeah , I was hoping to correct that before- - Uh , you know what ? Just let me show you ... Tell me more about Paracelsus . That 's all we know . Warehouse 9 wouldn 't have bronzed him without reason . Well , whatever they had on Paracelsus , they didn 't keep any records of it . I must access the restricted files . The what ? There are restrict- - there are restricted files ? Of course , only the Regents in their infinite wisdom would have restricted files so we couldn 't acc- - Arthur ... Not now . Yeah , uh , look , call me if there 's any change . - Artie , Artie . - What ? She didn 't just disappear . She walked away . Walked . Yeah . [ Bell dings ] [ Indistinct chatter , soft piano music ] Okay , guys , just act natural . - I am acting natural . - Good , good , good . Where is the little weasel ? Ah , just follow the money . There . He looks a lot better than he did last time we saw him . A lot more alive . [ Spoon clanging on glass ] Thank you all so much for joining us this evening . I 'm going to let you in on our little secret . This isn 't just a party . It 's an engagement party . Vladimir and I are going to be married . [ Applause ] My future duke . Ugh . Not again . He 's been someone 's future duke , earl , count , marquis , 12 times in five centuries . Yeah , well , maybe he thinks eventually he can trade them all in for king . So why do this ? The lonely hearts con . Get engaged to a wealthy noblewoman , stage a fancy party , and then she gets out all the family jewels . Heh heh . " Family jewels . " - So he can steal them ? - Yes . And afterwards , he 'll use them to do a thai gem scam or a rip deal- - God , it 's so predictable . You know what ? I 'll bet he 's that Nigerian prince that keeps emailing me . - [ Clears throat ] - No , not you . No , hey ... not you . Would you ... Sutton will be making off with the gems tonight . - We can 't lose him . - Okay , Pete ... - You circle- - - Guys , guys , guys , guys . I told you we should have worn moustaches . You 're saying the restricted files are kept in the storage room ? Is it a storage room ? [ Droning ] Do you mind ? [ Door squeaks ] [ Droning ] It 's nice to know that even grumpy , jaded Arthur Nielsen can still be surprised by endless wonder . I believe I said restricted . [ Door locks ] Yeah , no . I 'm not offended . Nope , nope . I 'm fine . I 'm sure you could go in . You 're a Methodist . [ Pinging ] There you are . Wait a minute . Yeah , this could be a possibility . Artie ! She 's getting worse . Again ? How much worse ? More crumbling , and faster . Took an hour for the Farnsworth . Now there 's racks starting everywhere . Not her yet , but it 's just a matter of time . - 64-A . - 64-A ? Yeah , it 's down . Two from the left . [ Clatter ] Hook her onto that . It 'll monitor her vitals . Meanwhile , I 'll keep looking into this . Well , look into what ? What is it ? You want a seminar or do you want to save her ? Go . Forgive me , darling . But I haven 't had you to myself for hours . Perhaps your entourage could be so kind as to give us some privacy ? We 'll be fine . Wait for me downstairs . - Oh ! [ Giggling ] - Mwah . [ Chuckles ] The formal announcement has left me rather unexpectedly amorous . Vladimir , you 're a rogue . That I am . To us , my darling . To us . To us . Hmm ? Whoop ! Oh ! The bubbles went straight to my head . Oh , you must lie down . I 'll join you . [ Both giggle ] Perhaps we could think of something to do while we 're down there , hmm ? [ Giggles ] Let me help you get more comfortable . Both : Mwah ! Hold it right there , Count Sticky Fingers ! Who are you ? We 're with the Secret Service . We 're here to extradite your fiance to the US . - What ? - He 's been a very bad boy . Some folks back home want a piece of him . No , you can 't ! Guards ! Guards ! I believe I have say in this . Her timing 's not bad . - And who are you ? - I 'm his wife . And I say to hell with extradition . [ Shrieks ] [ Screams ] The files from Paracelsus were redacted by the Regents of Warehouse 9 . It 's most unusual . Feel left out ? Tell me about it . - Beg pardon ? - Um , nothing . It 's not important . I 'll have to contact Mr. Kosan . Good . Yeah , bit of a ticking clock , you know ? If Sutton is a dead end , those files , they could ... be a clue to finding Paracelsus . Mrs. Frederic ! Yes . The files were redacted . I 'll have to contact Mr. Kosan . He 's dead ! My fiance is dead ! Are you all right ? [ Gasps ] Sorry , love . Long story . Uhh ! Hyah ! [ All grunting ] Uhh ! Agh ! Pete ! Myka ! He 's gone . Oh , man ! How many times are we gonna let him die and sneak off like that . Okay , Charlotte , you just stay here . And done shoot anyone else . [ Sighs ] Just gonna monitor your vitals . You know , it 's , uh ... it 's kind of weird , me doing all the talking . And , no , I don 't like it . I ... miss your constant chatter . Don 't worry , Claud . We 're gonna get you out of this . After all the times that you 've saved us . Oh , my God ! Pete ! - Gah ! [ Gasps ] - Oh ! I cast you out ! [ Labored breathing ] - Hey . - Oh ! [ Sobbing ] After all the times you 've saved us , you 'd never let us hear the end of it if we didn 't save you , right ? And , according to this , your vitals are ... not responding . Artie , for crying out loud ! [ Buzzer ] How did you hear me ? What ? No , look . I think I can boost her genetic material on a cellular level . That 'll help her fight deterioration . But I 'm gonna need DNA . Well , her toothbrush or a hairbrush . No , I need a blood sample from a family member . Hey , you 've reached the voicemail of Josh . - Leave me a message . - Yeah . Joshua , this is Artie again . Listen , I have left you messages on every number that you have . Will you call me back , please ? Urgent . Artie , her shoes and jacket are starting to crack , and I can 't get her vitals . Don 't worry , I will find Joshua . [ Dialing , line rings ] Hey , you 've reached the voicemail of Josh . Ah , Joshua , call me back . Joshua , call me back . Please , don 't make me do this . - Pardon me , pardon me . - Ah ! Look out ! Hey , hey ! Make a hole , make a hole ! Stop him ! Oy ! Oy , you there ! Uh , th-those two ! They 're intruders . They just attacked the duchess . [ All gasp ] [ Grunts and gasps ] Aah ! [ Woman screaming ] Got him . I , uh , guess we crashed the party . Huh . Did you see Mrs. Frederic ? Yes , I just left her at the BB . Yeah . She was a little unfocused this morning , but she 's gotten worse . And , if I didn 't know any better , I 'd say she was developing some kind of dementia . And rapidly--I don 't think she can help us anymore . The only thing we can do for Claudia now is to find out what is in those Paracelsus files . Come with me . No ... no , no . Didn 't Mrs. Frederic tell you ? The files have been redacted . They 're not there . There is something more urgent . Something we need to check . [ Droning ] This is the Eldunari , the Warehouse 's central nervous system . This is what makes the mind of the caretaker link with the soul of the Warehouse . The Eldunari . The symbols are moving in harmony . That 's a relief . Are they supposed to be doing that ? No , they 're not . The slow computer , Mrs. Frederic 's condition . Something is tearing apart the Warehouse from within its heart . Yes , I 'm afraid so . Mrs. Frederic 's mind is a mirror of the Eldunari . It seems that both of them are deteriorating . What is it with you two ? In five minutes , I 'd have had the jewels . You 're a common thief . I am not common . All right , look , we don 't want to see you either . We need your help . You crashed my engagement party and shot me because you need my help ? Watch your tone , darling , or next time I 'll shoot you in the face . Your brother bronzed our friend , and he won 't release her till he gets what he wants . Paracelsus ? Impossible . He 's basted in bronze himself . It 's ironic , since he 's the one who perfected the bronzing process . That 's how he knew what made the bronzer work . Yeah . Well ... Somebody let him out . He took the bronzing artifact with him . How could you be so stupid ? Me ? You did this to us . And , as I 've told you for half a millennium , it was only supposed to be me . I didn 't even believe it could do it . Sutton , Paracelsus took Nicholas . He says you know what he wants . Revenge spring to mind . Among other things . My brother was consumed with the idea of being immortal and what immortals could accomplish . But I was foolish enough to think him eccentric rather than insane . What did you do us ? I gave you a gift . A gift that not even God can give . Immortality . You shall live forever . [ Laughs ] You , in turn , assured me that philosopher 's stone works . Are you mad ? Waving some rock around didn 't make us immortal . But it did . [ Groaning ] [ Laughing ] Good God . [ Cackling ] I must have killed the three of you a dozen times - when you slept . - I didn 't think it possible . Anything is possible . At a cost . Took an entire village to turn the three of you into God . You killed them ? Well , great achievement comes at a price . Socrates was executed . Magellan died proving the world was round . They gave their own lives , not the lives of others . More fool them . Now get out . He was brilliant , but lived in his own moral universe . To kill an entire village . I didn 't know what his end game was , but I wouldn 't allow him to cause more death . I went to the authorities . But it was the agents of Warehouse 9 - who collected him . - What is this ? How dare you ! What are you doing here ? After he was bronzed , the Regents wanted the philosopher 's stone . But I told them it had been destroyed . I wouldn 't destroy it , in case we needed it again . So I split it and hid the two halves . You took a crystal from inside the geode . Your ring--that 's how you restored plants as the Count of St. Germain . A fellow has to eat . That little trick helped me pay my bills . Oh , as if you 've ever paid a bill . - Touche . - So you have the ring ? No , they have the ring . They took it from me in Paris . No , Paracelsus has the ring . - You have the stone . - Half the stone . The Warehouse found the other half and then lost it to pirates . Until I found it . So you have the stone ? - No , they have the stone . - They have the stone ? You just said you have the stone . No , I said they had the stone . Okay , just stop ... talking . Tell me that you know how to get to your half . Of course . I have it locked safely away . I want my son away from him . My brother had some plan in mind back then that I interrupted . He 's bound to go at it again . He 's already killed hundreds . He 'll kill us and anyone else who gets in the way of his science . Yeah , well , first we have to find him . He 'll go to his lab . After 500 years , it 's still there ? It 's deep beneath the Monastery of Stoudios in Constantinople . The monastery 's in ruins , but the lab is still intact . You 've been there , haven 't you ? [ Grunts ] Ah . Claud , are you there ? Well , this setup belonged to Barry Seal . He was a pilot / drug smuggler who flew covert missions for the CIA . - You should probably- - - Oh , my God , Steve ! Can you hear me ? Yes ! Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Claud , loud and clear . Are you okay ? Over . You mean aside from being the tin man in a bronze production of The Wizard Of Oz ? I 'm just peachy . What 's going on ? Where 's Paracelsus , and why am I melting ? Well , technically , you 're crumbling . I 'm working a Wizard Of Oz motif here , Steve . God , why am I gayer than you ? [ Chuckles ] [ Farnsworth buzzing ] Oh , hold on a sec , okay ? [ Buzzing continues ] Look , I can 't reach Joshua . I know where he is , it 's not far , but it 's a high-security facility--no cell service . Is there any way to contact him ? Not by phone , but don 't worry- - I 'm gonna get the DNA right now . Okay . Claud , hey , your , uh , your bronze state isn 't stable . It 's disintegrating . But Artie thinks he can use DNA to help you . He 's on his way to Joshua right now . Joshua 's DNA can un-bronze me ? No , no , but ... but Artie thinks that he can use it to stop the deterioration . I feel this weirdness in my nerve endings . Is it getting worse ? [ Cracking ] No . No , you just hang in there , Claud . [ Men shouting , swords clanking ] [ Bell tolls ] This monastery has been destroyed and rebuilt at least a dozen times . I mean , how did you keep Paracelsus 's lab intact ? Bribery and coercion . I 've been trying for centuries to find a way to undo what Paracelsus did . You 're not the only one who loves our son . [ Clank ] [ Loud creak ] It 's not much farther . The main lab is just around this corner . Probably best if we come at him from both sides . Pete , you and Charlotte go this way . Sutton and I will loop around . Each team has half a stone , so if anyone gets caught , we have bargaining power . Good luck . [ Echoing ] No ! Nick ! Hey ! Charlotte , wait ! - Wait . - Hey . I lost Sutton . He heard the scream and he thought it was Nick . So did Charlotte . We gotta find ' em before Paracelsus does . Right . This way ? - Yeah . - Okay . Oh , my God , Pete , look at this place . - The bronzing artifact . - Pete , look at this . That 's the calvary cross , the tree of life . And the ouroboros . Life out of death . I bet there 's a pattern . I 'll grab the stele . Pete , wait ! I think that 's a ... [ Clang , grinding ] A trap ? Pete ! Okay , I think I found something that 'll help . Not as good as DNA , but maybe enough to save your haircut . What , my haircut 's in danger ? [ Clink ] Maybe not , but I liked you better with short hair . I 've been trying to grow it out . Well , least it hasn 't started on your nose yet . Oh , you 're not trying to grow that out , are you ? Heh . Whatever 's happening , I think it 's speeding up . I can 't feel my legs anymore , more chest is starting to hurt , so how ' bout you hurry up with the slowing down ? I figured that you 're oxidizing , so I brought the binnacle from the USS Squalus , a submarine that sank in 1939 . Now , a lot of the men survived 40 hours on a minimal amount of oxygen , so I figure I 'm gonna use the binnacle to suck all the oxygen out of the bronzer , slowing down your deterioration . Jinksy ! I 'm impressed . Take it to periscope depth . Let 's give it a try . [ Buzzing , whoosh ] [ Air hissing ] Damn it ! Steve . Oh , tell me you got it . - I got it ! - Okay . Hang in there , Claudia . [ Buzzer ] I got the blood sample . Atomized the DNA . Okay . Now we just watch and hope . And , you know , pray . [ Crackling ] [ Chuckling ] Whew . Claud , Claud . - Already stopped it . - Whoo hoo ! I didn 't stop it . I just delayed it . About 14 hours or so . Hopefully long enough for Myka and Pete to snag the stele . [ Grunting ] Pete ? Pete , wake up . - Where is he ? - Who ? Where is he ? Where did he go ? Where 'd who go ? Paracelsus . He was ... he was here . Oh , no . Myks , Myks . The stone . The stone , he 's- - he 's got the stone . All right , so ... How did he- - how did he get in here ? I don 't know , I don 't know . I conked out . How do we get out of here ? Same way we got in ? [ Grunting ] Sutton , is that you ? Nick ! God . 500 years together , and still the perfect little family . You bastard . - Stop ! - Don 't ! Don 't . It 's Coleridge 's fishing net . And he has far more dangerous artifacts than that . Listen to your son , Charlotte . He 's a bright lad . [ Laughing ] Now ... [ Laughing ] What was once mine is mine again . Be good and quiet . And I 'll make you mortal again . [ Sizzling ] Breathe , my little lab rats . [ All inhaling ] Uhh ! [ Thud ] For centuries , I was encased in bronze , unable to think about a thing , except my revenge . If you hadn 't gone to the authorities , my dear brother , the Warehouse would never have found me . And things would have turned out very different . You took everything from me . Now I 'll take something from you . [ Cocks gun ] [ All gasp ] Not Nick ! No ! Uhh ! Hey ! Drop it ! [ Electricity zapping ] Warehouse agents are always so clever . But never clever enough ! [ Crashing and rumbling ] Uhh ! [ Rumbling ] - You okay , Myks ? - Yeah , go ! Oh ! Not so fast , Senator Palpatine ! Look ... Sutton , Nick , just try and get Charlotte out of here , okay ? I need to go get the stele . No ! Charlotte ! Nick ! Sutton ? Hey , you guys are mortal now . Falling building hurt ! [ Grunting ] Hold on , mother , just hold on ! [ Grunting and groaning ] Oh , my God . [ Both grunting ] Guys , this whole place is collapsing . We 've got to get out of here . I 'm sorry , love . I 'm so sorry . I thought we had much more time . It 's all right . Just go . Just go , get out of here . No , no . Mother , we can do this . I 'm sorry , we have got to go . I 'm not leaving her . Oh , yes , you can . Just for once , just ... listen to me . Look after our son . Hey , please . It 's what we 've wanted . It 's what we 've worked for all these years . [ Rumbling ] You 've got a life . Live it now . Uhh ! Hey , I got the stele . We should ... Pete , is she ... Oh , my God , I 'm so sorry . [ Crashing ] Nick , Sutton , I 'm so sorry , but we have to go . We--we are running out of time ! - We have to go now ! - Let 's go ! Nick ! [ Crashing ] Mother . Nick , go ! Go ! [ Rumbling ] I 've spoken with the Regents , and we agree that the danger Paracelsus presents requires us to uncover what had been permanently expunged from the Warehouse files . How--how can we- - As you know , information of this nature is held by the Keeper . The one person in each generation who learns vital parts of Warehouse history and maintains them in a living memory . Yes , the Keeper . The fail-safe for highly classified secrets . We must met him at once . There 's no need . The Keeper is here . I 'm sorry , Irene . It was necessary for my identity to remain a secret . I understand . There 's no need to apologize . This is a lei niho palaoa , once worn by Hawaii 's queen Ka 'ahumanu . The ancestral hair that was used to braid it holds the memories of past Warehouses . And only the memory can release them . In the early days of Warehouse 9 , the alchemist Paracelsus , was becoming a dangerous threat , not only to the Warehouse , but to all of mankind . It was therefore necessary for the Regents of Warehouse 9 to take action . [ Beeping ] [ Buzzer , air hissing ] [ Alarm buzzing ] [ Air hisses , clang ] [ Coughing ] It worked . You 're back . - You okay ? - Here , Claud , here . - Let me help you . - Uh-huh , great . You want my coat ? Here , take my coat . Okay . Whew . We could have lost Claudia . [ Sighs ] So I 'm not gonna let you ignore it anymore . Ignore what ? You heard Sutton . He thought they had so much time . I mean , hell , we all do . We--we think we have all the time in the world , but we don 't . We--we just don 't . You ... have ... cancer . And you need to get it taken care of . Because I 'm not gonna play that scene , Myka . I 'm not gonna regret all the years that I didn 't get to spend with you . - Okay . - [ Sighs ] Okay , I 'll book an appointment with my doctor , okay ? All right . Just don 't , okay ?

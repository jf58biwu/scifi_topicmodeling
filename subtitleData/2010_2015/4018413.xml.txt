 What are you doing ? Put me down . Put me down ! Ugh ! Yah ! Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Do you ever have one of those moments where you think , " how the hell did I get here ? " [ The Who 's " Baba O 'Riley " plays ] Geez , what happened to me ? I was ruling the galaxy , had a cherry-new battle station ... I mean , this place had an omelet bar ... a straight-up omelet bar ! And now look . My former intern 's tossing me down a bottomless freaking pit . [ Sighs ] You know , come to think of it , my whole life has been a series of " what the [ bleep ] " moments . That , uh ... That was my out . I didn 't always look like a boiled cow hemorrhoid . Cast your eyes on that handsome devil right there . Don 't be alarmed if your undies turn into a moist towelette . And that is where we 'll put the skylight , Mr. Palpatine . How exciting ! Only 23 and already building my dream home , right on the Naboo beach . [ Crowd booing ] Hey , man , stop harshing those gungan eggs ! Gungans are endangered , man ! Hippies suck ass in every galaxy . What ? Gungans aren 't endangered . There 's like a billion of them . They breed like guppies . Boo ! Boo ! Boo on you , man ! Boo on you , dude ! [ Engine turns over ] [ Crowd screaming ] And that is why we should change the zoning law . And what of the gungan eggs ? We 'll give ' em to the school hot-lunch program . [ Applause ] Heesa say what now ? Young man , you should consider a career in politics . Hey , yeah . I should . And I did . [ " Baba O 'Riley " continues ] You 're welcome , galaxy . Never did thank that guy . And so , emperor Palpatine has followed up the bloodiest war in the history of the galaxy by imposing a tyrannical dictatorship and killing all the Jedi . I 've ruined the galaxy . Wheel ! Of ! Fortune ! Ooh ! [ " Baba O 'Riley " continues ] See that little cub scout ? Anakin Skywalker , baby . Eventually , I pick him to rule the galaxy by my side .

Did anyone else pick up that transmission ? It sounds like a little girl is on our comm channel . Aw . Much fear I sense in young Anakin . To be trained as a Jedi , he must not be . He could bring balance to the force . Correct you are . I thought you said that would be bad . Fm the prophecy , that boy could be . Can I ask what the prophecy is ? Why is that something I don 't know ? I will tell him of the council 's decision tomorrow . Oh , so it 's a council now ? It 's not just the two of you ? What about you , dogface ? Did you know what now it was a council ? Inform the senate we must of our lessened ability to use the force . Who can 't use the force now ? I can still use the force . Let 's put that one to a vote , because I don 't even know what that means . Does anyone realize that I 'm talking ? Enough for today . We should eat . Getting pizza , yarel poof should do . All in favor ? All : Aye ! Ugh ! I just got the coffee yesterday , and I submitted the receipt , have yet to be reimbursed . Is anyone else having this issue ? But oh , look , if it 's the will of the council , then I 'll go . All : Aye ! Fine ! Listen , yaddle , I 'm gonna need to borrow your car . Um ... In the shop it is ? I just saw it downstairs . Well , insurance and ... Okay , then I am going . I am one of 12 Jedi in the whole galaxy on the Jedi council , and today , it 's my job to get the pizza . Sure . Yeah , my parents ...

I 'm a senator , you know . I 'm in agony , Padmé ! I can 't breathe ! Have you tried yoga ? All us politicians do it . Ungh . Ungh , that 's tight . [ Moaning ] If , uh , you 're suffering as much as I am , please tell me . Oh , Annie . You 're a Jedi , and I 'm a queen and a handmaiden and a senator . [ Moans ] Ugh . Whoops-a-Daisy . Uhh ... Let 's get you clean , dirty boy . [ Whirs , beeps ] Sorry . You 're in my very soul , tormenting me . Ungh . I wish I could just wish away my feelings . But I can 't ! I will not get into this . And neither will you . Throw it back , dad . [ Clang ] Dad ? Henceforth , you shall be known as Darth Vader . Thank you , my master . Hey , before you go , my face is really warm . Is everything okay up here ? I don 't know . What do you mean ? [ Sniffs ] Ah . Ah-ah ... Ow ! Ah , ah , ow ! My face ! It 's on fire ! Well , there is a possibility that when you were fighting Mace Windu , he deflected some of your force lightning back into your face . Are you kidding me ? How much ? [ Laughing ] A lot . I don 't think there was one bolt of force lightning that didn 't bounce off master Windu 's light saber directly back into your face . And you just sat there and watched ? Well , uh , turning to the dark side was a pretty big decision . Oh , my God , I look like ... I look like I have a scrotum for a face ! What am I supposed to call myself ... Darth Syphilis ? ! If you 'd made up your mind five seconds earlier , we could have ruled the galaxy and maybe I could have gotten laid one more time before I died . Uh , I can see you 're upset . I 'm just gonna go slaughter those younglings . Yeah , whatever . They didn 't have calamari pizza because mon calamari are people , and I did not know that . [ Gasping ] Is everyone on the council dead ? Oh , I better hurry , then . My time is short ! [ As Yoda ] " Hey , everyone , I 'm Yoda . Mmm , talk weird , I do . Hate leads to anger , and anger leads to never letting anyone else talk ! " Ah ! Oh , no !

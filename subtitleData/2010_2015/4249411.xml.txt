 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... H.G. ' s not really here . She 's a hologram . That thing is projecting her . I drew my gun on Mrs. Fredrick , and she fired me . How can my mom be a Regent and not have told me ? Collodi 's Bracelet . I think it fell into the hands of a young boy . The bracelet gave him control of his own body , enabling him to walk . But it would have planted a seed of darkness in his soul . Claudia , now would be a good time to pinpoint that signal . I 'm trying , but whatever 's transmitting from inside the warehouse has slowed the whole system to a crawl . Pete , Myka . Any sign of the intruder , yet ? Letter 36-J ? It 's quiet . Ditto , in Montgomery . 84-K . Clean in the Farnsworth aisle . The archive is safe . Well , keep looking . Someone or something is still transmitting . Pete , you enter dark vault . And Myka , you go to aisle- - Gotcha . Sulaco , 84-C . It 's there . Sulaco , 84-C . That 's right near the art gallery . Let 's go , Claudia . Bring the scanner . That 's why the computers have been so glitchy lately . We 've got bugs . To be specific , nanites . Aw , man . What are nanites ? I don 't know . Tiny , self-replicating microscopic robots . Mechanical fleas slash spies . Could have hitched a ride on anything . No , no , no , no , no , no . Not these . These were planted on that Van Gogh that Sally Stukowski helped us retrieve . That painting is now exactly one gram lighter . That grab was a setup . If she 's working for that psychopath that tried to kill my mom- - Walter Sykes ? They 're downloading a massive amount of data and transmitting it . To where ? I can 't tell yet . I want those things out of my warehouse , now . It could take me days to interface with their coding , Artie . Then plan B. When you got bugs , you zap ' em . Okay , everybody , back up . Say hello to my little friend . Oh , crap . Oh , no , no , no , no ! Oh , what are you doing ? Something wrong here , Tyler ? Uh , no , Mr. Sykes , I- - I think the warehouse found and shut down all the nanites . Before you got what I needed ? No , uh , I got it . Um , you 'll be happy . Have you decrypted the data yet ? I 'm-I 'm working on it , sir . Finish it . Then I 'll be happy . Yes , sir . These nanites could be a fatal breach . Do we have any idea what Sykes was after ? I 'm typing as fast as I can . Okay , first , he rifled through some inventory . Looking for the Collodi Bracelet , I 'll bet . Then he downloaded a file . " Atlas-66 . " But it 's majorly encrypted . That file is for Regent use only . Well , here 's hoping . What do you think ? Sykes could have opened that file ? Uh , I 'm not even sure I could crack it . Well , you don 't have to . Jane has access . She can tell us what 's in the file , and we can finally get ahead of Sykes . That 's not how we 'll proceed . But this could be our chance to shut Sykes down . The Regents have a plan in place , Agent Bering . So you 're not gonna tell us what 's in Atlas-66 ? Perhaps I haven 't been clear . We have a plan in place . Well , perhaps I haven 't been clear . We need to know what 's in that file . Right , Pete ? - Hmm ? Uh , well- - Myka , if she says there 's a plan in place , we need to respect that , right ? I mean , she is wearing the Remati Shackle . So , Warehouse protection is her call . Thank you , Pete . Now , excuse me . I need to speak to Mr. Kosan . Excuse me , I need to tag some stuff in the motorbike aisle . And with that , we all just left it alone , right ? Of course . Right . Lattimer ! What the hell is going on ? Trust me , Myka . Arguing with my mother will get you nowhere . So you 're just gonna lie down ? Who are you ? A guy who knew you 'd follow me . Old chum , welcome to the Pete Cave . Sit down . I got something to show you . You 're not gonna make me watch Porky 's again , are you ? No . So , you 're not just sitting back . Please . Okay . Now , these are the facts . Walter Sykes , paralyzed as a child , gets his hands on the Collodi Bracelet , which allows him to walk again , but apparently , it turns him into like , the worst guy ever . Right . The Warehouse snags it . Sykes wants it back . He makes millions in hedge funds . Then , ten years ago , he cashes out and apparently vanishes off the face of the Earth . So he 's been planning a run at the Warehouse for a long time ? Right , but the minions he 's hired to do his dirty work all have one thing in common . They 're dead . Well , the obit says that Stukowski died of an undetected heart defect . Yeah , right . So , who 's working for Walter Sykes , now ? Everything okay ? - Yeah . - Stay close . I 'm going to need you two to collect something important . We 're ready . ♪ Warehouse 13 3x11 ♪ Emily Lake Original Air Date on October 3 , 2011 = = sync , corrected by elderman = = You wanted to talk to me , Mr. Sykes ? Steve , you 're still trying to decide if you can trust me ? Well , the enemy of my enemy is my friend , right ? Look , I just want my life back . My old job , my reputation . The Warehouse burned you . It burned me , too . You know , the Regents have a nasty habit of reaching out and destroying people 's lives . Believe me . I 've noticed . So , if I help you get the Collodi Bracelet back , you can get me reinstated at the ATF ? Yeah . Or you can have a blank check and start a new life . That 's your call . Tyler cracked the first part of the file . We know where it is . The only lead we have left is this man who I clocked in Atlanta . It 's just the face in a car . It 's not much to go on . Okay . So , we profile , right ? I mean , what kind of person goes to work for a man like Walter Sykes ? A guy like Tyler Struhl . Hey , did you follow us here ? No , I 've known about the Pete Cave forever . Who do you think keeps it stocked with cream soda ? Really ? That was you ? Wait , who 's Tyler Struhl ? The hacker slash perv who was killing women with the Golem Necklace . Hacker codes are like a signature , and Tyler 's all over the nanites . Could he hack into the Regent file ? If I can , he can . I mean , I haven 't been able to open the whole thing , but I did dig out an address . Lincoln High School , Cheyenne , Wyoming . Well , Cheyenne is only like , two hours from here . We should check it out . Against Jane 's orders ? What 's she gonna do ? Ground me ? Anyway , I 'm not going to sit around here and wait for the next bad thing to happen . I agree with Pete . I 'll run interference . Go . Go now while she 's still with Kosan . This is a dangerous game . We must bring the rest of Regents in on your plan . No . Sykes has already tortured and killed Regents to get information . The less they all know , the better . This is a great burden for you to bear alone . Perhaps we should simply eliminate Walter Sykes now and- - Evan ... We all agreed that we needed to know his endgame . Without that knowledge , even with Sykes gone , the Warehouse is still vulnerable . There 's more that 's troubling you . My son is on the frontline of this war . If I 'm wrong ... I could lose a lot more than the Warehouse . I 'm going to take upstairs . You take down . Hey , Myks . You got anything ? I think I found what Sykes was looking for . You found the artifact ? Not quite . H.G. Wells is--is here ? What-she--she broke out of Regent jail to come here ? I wanna go talk to her . Ah , Myka , no . You-you know how lethal she is . We don 't know what she 's up to . Just wait there for me . Helena . Hello . Are you looking for somebody ? Do the Regents know you 're here ? Um- - I 'm sorry , you must be lost . The main office is straight down the hall . Look , we don 't have time for games . Some very dangerous people know that you 're here . Um , okay , uh- - there must be some mistake here . Uh , let 's just school security and then- - - Freeze ! - Ah ! Now that 's new . Why 'd you come in here , all guns a-blazing ? It 's an escaped H.G. Wells , Myks . What if she was having one of her let 's-end-the-world days ? No , something 's wrong , okay ? She 's acting like she doesn 't even know who I am . Well , at least we know what Sykes is after . But what he wants with lady cuckoo ? Hello . Hi . Who are you people ? What do you want from me ? We 're United States Secret Service . We may be dealing with a case of identity theft . We just need to see your driver 's license . It 's in my purse . Careful , Myka . Well , it could be booby trapped . Pete , look at this . Who the heck is Emily Lake ? I don 't suppose we could put a doggy door in the umbilicus ? Doggy door . You 're silly . Whatcha doing ? Ah , you know . Updating the firewalls , reviewing inventory , blah bitty blah . The ushe . Fine . Okay . You got me . I 'm playing fruit combat . Until Jane tells us the plan , I am bored , so- - All right . I 'm going to my room . Trailer . Busted . Did you just Mrs. Frederic 'd me ? Tell me that that is not the Regents ' encrypted Atlas file , and that you are not doing the one thing that you were explicitly told not to do . That would be lying and if there 's one thing I 'll never do- - Where are Pete and Myka ? I still don 't know why the Secret Service has to see my apartment , but here it is . I-I 'm not this Helena , whoever that is . Look , it 's not--it 's not that we don 't believe you . It 's just we want to understand what 's going on . There 's something in the kitchen . Oh , Dickens . Mommy 's home . H.G. Wells is a ... Cat lady ? Yeah , good boy . Hello . Dickens is hungry . And scared . - Just like his mommy . - Oh . I 'm gonna feed him . Shoot me if you have to . Myka , we don 't have time for this , okay ? Sykes could be on his way here right now . Bills , magazines- - they 're all addressed to Emily Lake . Okay , so she fooled the post office . It 's not that hard to do . Myka , don 't buy this . She is a lunatic killer , and she 's just- - she 's hiding it somehow . Pete ... Oh , my God . Look at this . There 's no reflection in the mirror . She wasn 't really there . These--these are all fakes . Somebody must have created a-a new identity for her . Who does that sound like to you ? The Regents ? Some sort of Witness Protection program ? We got this info from the Atlas file . Atlas-66 . That 's--that 's it . H.G. Wells was born in Atlas House in 1866 . I can 't believe that I missed that . Yeah , sloppy . We gotta get her somewhere safe before Sykes finds her . Let me go . I 've-I 've got a knife . All right . Let 's not do that , okay ? Do you see ? H.G. knows Kempo . If she wanted to hurt you , you 'd be lying in a pool of your own blood right now . I-I-I don 't want to hurt anyone . I just- - Wait . What is it ? I got a vibe . A bad one . Aw . You just missed her . Where is she ? What does Sykes want with H.G. ? Time machine , Minoan Trident ? Or just another homicidal maniac to add to his roster ? He was right . You are a talker . Who was right ? Hey . You guys okay ? Pete . Steve , what- - He took my Tesla . You 're working for Sykes ? Where 's Marcus ? Marcus ? Oh , oh . Is that--is that your new partner ? The guy who just tried to kill me ? I 've got some bad news for you , pal . What the hell ? Is that H.G. ? Yes . Then we 're done . No ! Farnsworth . You are both in big trouble . You don 't know the half of it . We lost her , Artie . W-wait . Lost who ? Emily Lake . You two found Emily Lake ? Where is she ? Sykes has her . Damn it ! This is why you follow orders ! Look , Sykes would have gotten her either way , and we wouldn 't have known about it . We know who 's working for him , Artie . A guy by the name of Marcus who just walked away from a five-story fall . What ? And someone else . Someone we know . No . No way , that 's- - Artie , that 's not even possible . Steve would never turn on us . We 're his friends . He 's-he 's--must be being controlled or blackmailed , or maybe there 's an arti- - Claudia , Claudia . He Tesla 'd Pete and Myka . He kidnapped H.G. No one was forcing him to do those things . Then this is the Regents ' fault . They burned him . They gave him no choice . Everyone has a choice . And as I 've discovered , people often make the wrong one . Please . I have no idea what you 're talking about . I 've never even heard of any ... Warehouse 13 . You are H.G. Wells . That 's insane . My name is Emily Lake . Emily Hannah Lake ! I grew up in Omaha- - You 're lying . She 's telling the truth . You 're absolutely certain ? You know I can tell , and she 's not lying . Or at least she believes what she 's saying is true . Well , I got a gift too , Steve . Getting people to tell me things . Cecil B. Demille 's riding crop . It won 't work . It lets you bend people 's actions to your will . But you can 't control their minds . You 've collected quite a few artifacts . Yeah , enough to even up the odds . I 'm inclined to trust your gift , Steve . I mean , after all , that is why we sought you out . So we 'll leave Ms. Lake alone , and give Tyler enough time to crack the rest of that file . Hopefully , the answers are inside . For her sake . What exactly did you do to H.G. ? Myka , it was the most humane option . After the near-catastrophe at Yosemite , well , the Regents had to do something . The punishment was unusual , but it wasn 't cruel . We searched for something that would give H.G. a chance at a normal life while still allowing us to use her as a resource . Claudia , I assume you cracked the rest of Atlas-66 . Yup . A Janus coin . Two heads . It facilitates the separation of a person 's consciousness from their body . Like the Zoetrope did to Hugo . The Zoetrope is a machete . The Janus coin is a finely honed scalpel . Artie , show them the video . It will make it clear . So ... How exactly will this work ? In Roman mythology , Janus is the God of transitions . There 's two heads , looking opposite directions . Forward and back . My past life and my future life . Yes . And the coin will separate the two . So , I 'll lose all knowledge of the Warehouse . Yes . And everyone I 've ever known ? Yes . One request . May I keep my love of literature ? That can be arranged . We 'll start with your earliest memories . Mother and father . That 's right . Move through your childhood . Your young adulthood . Your first day at Warehouse 12 . Tell me what you 're thinking . I met an old man . He was my teacher . His name was Caturanga . Tell me his name again . I- - I don 't remember . Good . Think about your inventions , your experiments , your writings . Picture Kempo and weaponry . People ... Friends , family , lovers . Let the images come to you . Conjure them . Your whole life in England , let it go . You 're American now . Who are you ? I 'm Mr. Kosan . You had a terrible accident . And you lost your memory . But I 'm going to help you get it back . Thank you . They sent her to Wyoming , gave her a place to live , a cat , photos of the past that never existed , and we gave her a job . School teacher . Like you . As for the rest , well , the human mind is pretty inventive . Given enough time and stimulation , it fills in the gaps all by itself . So if H.G. ' s memory 's been wiped , then who 's the hologram we 've been talking to the last few months ? Not wiped . Stored . On the Janus coin . Which , according to the file , is kept in a Regent vault in Elk Ridge , South Dakota . Sykes is going to send Marcus and Steve for the coin . Look , I know that the Regents have a plan , but we can 't risk Sykes getting a hold of that coin . If he already has Emily Lake , if he tries to put H.G. back together ... You 're both right . You and Myka need to retrieve that coin , and bring it back here . Mr. Sykes ! Mr. Sykes ! I got it . I found what you 're looking for . And the best part is it 's not even in the Warehouse . So , how do we get into this vault ? Mom said all we 'd need is this fancy key and this list of stuff to buy . This is the Regent vault ? Of course it is . Hidden in plain sight . That 's what they do . You got our list ? Alfred , let 's go shopping . That 's weird . Not when you get to know us . I gotta get my manager . Okay . Fruits , grain , meats , alcohol , honey . These are all items that the ancient Egyptians used to leave for their Kings in the burial tombs- - Which were also known as vaults . Right . Man , the Regents really love the Egyptian stuff , huh ? It 's like a fetish . Wow , definitely in the right grocery store . Come with me . The key . Oh . He 's not very chatty , is he ? No , he 's not . I 'll be in the stock room . Okay , so , here 's the sphere . Where 's the Janus coin ? I remember seeing a slot . Ah-ha . See ? I always loved piggy banks . - What ? - Let me see . So , then if a coin is like the hard disk , then to reboot , I just slide it back in . Oh , hello . What 's this ? Uh , another mission ? Lady , we 've got a lot to tell you . Living with a cat in Wyoming ? Also , you have an American accent and a really girly scream . So , my body 's out there teaching high school English ? And your students love you . But a cat ? Dickens is solid . Saved my bacon . Yes , I don 't know what that means , but what does this Mr. Sykes want from me ? We were kinda hoping you could tell us . Uh--I 'm afraid I have absolutely no idea . Get her here as fast as you can , and keep your eyes open . And be careful . Stick to the back roads . The back roads ? Driving from Elk Ridge to Univille ? Good point . Stay alert . I don 't have a good feeling about all this . I 'm not used to military maneuvers . I 'm an elementary school teacher . Elementary school teacher to Regent . Strange trajectory . Not at all . Each Regent is selected for his or her area of expertise . Each brings a unique perspective . I was chosen for my insight into children . Jane ... What 's the downside to the Collodi Bracelet ? If the user wears it for too long , it plants a seed of darkness in the soul and creates an insatiable longing . And at the same time , this longing hardens the heart . The wearer cannot give or receive love . Is it possible , all those years ago , we didn 't get to the boy in time ? Hey , Myka . I , uh--I have a thought . About a way to protect the Warehouse , but- - But what ? You might not like it . Well , if it protects the Warehouse , I like it already . What is it ? Whoa , where are we going ? Off road . We have to destroy the Janus coin . What ? I know you 're gonna think this is personal- - How could I not ? You 're--you 're talking about killing a human being . No , I 'm talking about destroying the thing that Sykes is after . We can stop it , right here . Right now . She has one of the greatest minds in history ! It 's--it would be like burning down a library w-with a friend trapped inside . I know . But we 're at war , and unfortunately , wars have casualties . No . Okay , so you 're willing to live with the possibility that Sykes might get what he wants . H.G. would never help him . Myka , the man has proven he can get information from anyone . Even Steve 's working for him . No , he 's not . I know he 's not . Okay , just hold up . Both of you . We have to deal with reality . Wait , Claudia . Claudia ! Like , I 'm just thinking of the greater good . As long as that coin exists , it can be used against the Warehouse . The answer is still no . We cannot--I will not destroy H.G. Wells . May I offer an opinion ? I figured she should be part of this discussion . There is no discussion . Agreed . If you truly want to protect the Warehouse , you must destroy the coin . Destroy the coin , and whatever Sykes wants from me will be lost with it . Wait . You 'd be gone , you 'd- - you 'd be dead . The price is too high . What about Emily Lake ? If Sykes thinks he can put her back together , she 's in a lot of danger . Destroy me , and she 'll be of no value to him . Myka , you say she 's a teacher and her students love her . Then , let me live on through her . We could rescue Emily Lake . I can promise you that . I have every confidence that you will . Myka , we have to think rationally , not emotionally . And quickly . Before I remember that I 'm not this noble . It 's the right thing to do , Myka . You know that , don 't you ? Pete , um--I think you 'll have to be the one to-- - I know . I will . And ... Thanks for everything , Helena . I regret I won 't be here to see you reach your destiny . It will surely be a glorious one . I don 't know about that . Then , you 're the only one . How do you say goodbye to the one person who knows you better than anyone else ? I wish I knew . Be brave . I need your strength . The last thing I want to see is the sky . Pete . I can 't watch this . Me neither . Forgive me for this . Why can 't I move ? Because I 'm controlling your body now . I 'll get the coin . Not one move ! Myka , he has an artifact . How 'd you find us ? Traced the signal on Claudia 's cell . You 're a traitor . Traitor . Stop or Marcus is dead ! Yeah , well , Marcus doesn 't usually stay dead for long . Then I 'll shoot you , Steve . I don 't think that you will . Just in case ... No ! Myka ! Claudia ! Give me the coin . You know what ? I got a better idea . How about you fill in the blanks ? Tell me how we went from being partners and friends to you pointing a gun at me ? How could you work for Sykes ? There are things that you don 't know . About the Regents , about Jane . Now , give me the coin . I know this . You want this coin ? You 're going to have to shoot me . Claudia ! Claudia ! I don 't care what I have to do . You 're dead , man . You 're dead ! You 're very perceptive . Hey , where 's Claudia ? Where is she ? Do you have the coin ? Let 's go . Now , you can help Claudia and Myka , or you can follow us . That 's your choice . - You selfish- - - Pete ! If you 're gonna help Claudia , you have to hurry up . - Claudia ! - Claude ? Are you all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Claudia ! Claudia ! Claude ! Please keep it down . - Why didn 't you answer us ? - Is Steve gone ? He told me to wait until he was gone . Wait--wait for what ? Claudia , what 's going on ? And how did he get the coin ? I gave it to him . What ? He told me your mom 's plan . You want this coin ? You 're gonna have to shoot me . Listen , Claudia . Listen to me . I am undercover . The whole thing has been a setup . Mrs. F fired me in Atlanta , Jane and the Regents burning me- - my mission is to gain Sykes ' trust , so I can learn what he 's planning . Now can you calm down , now ? Yeah ? But you Tesla 'd Pete and Myka . Better than letting Marcus shoot them . I wish ... That you could look in my eyes and see that I 'm not lying . I 'm still on your side , Claude . I always have been . I am so sorry that I didn 't tell you the truth , but it was the safest way . Whatever Sykes is planning is bad for everyone in the Warehouse . I 've never seen anyone so filled with hate . Then , get out of there . Why are you taking this huge risk , getting chummy with those psychos ? Because ... I couldn 't save my sister . But I can protect you . Show this to Pete and Myka . It 's where he is . And don 't make a sound till you know I 'm gone . Cover your ears . So brave . That 's why Jane couldn 't tell us . Steve is the plan . It all rests on him . He volunteered . He had a lot of experience going undercover at ATF . And he 'd been here the briefest . It would seem more plausible that he would turn than anyone else . Why did he help Sykes find Emily Lake and H.G. ? Without him , it wouldn 't have happened . His orders were to embed himself . Learn what Sykes ' plan is . And even assist him when needed . When Sykes enters his end game , Agent Jinks will get us a message . Oh , we got the message . Skybrook Three . It 's a decommissioned airport in Featherhead . It must be hanger three . That son of a bitch was under our noses the whole time . We 're on our way there now . Pete , be careful . I- - I love you , too , Mom . Let 's see if this really works , huh ? W-what are you doing ? What is that ? The end of Emily Lake ? No . Now , just remember . Just relax and remember . H.G. Wells ? It would appear you got to the coin before Pete could destroy it . You must be Mr. Sykes . It 's a pleasure to finally meet you . Um- - the plane 's ready if you wanna go . Steve , I want you to know none of this would have been possible without your help , buddy . Damn it , they 're gone . Too late . Pete ? What is it ? What 's wrong ? Nothing . They 're gone . Let 's get back to the car . What 's wrong ? Claudia , I said get back to the car ! Pete ? What is it ? Please get back to the car . Pete ... = = sync , corrected by elderman = = No ! Claudia !

Fat man and little boy . It 's a deletion program . It 's a hacker nuclear bomb . This hard drive is a crater . This was for nothing . Sykes needed H.G. for something . We need to find him . Oh , we 're gonna find him . And when we find him ... We 're gonna get payback . You 're not too talkative , Ms. Wells . Penny for your thoughts ? You killed that young man in cold blood . Really ? What temperature was your blood when you killed ? 'Cause you got a bigger body count than I do . And I 'm seriously considering adding one more to that list . Go ahead . Go ahead . Go ahead . Go on . Kill me . Cecil B. Demille 's riding crop . Look at that . Lets my mind control your body . It 's pretty damn cool , don 't you think ? What do you want from me ? Some advice . I 'd strongly recommend a good psychologist . Advice on what ? Opening a certain lock . According to this , you got an old friend who taught you how to do it , right ? Something named Caturanga . Ms. Wells ? What do you smell ? Ms. Wells ? What do you smell ? Apples ? Yes . You do . Most people do not smell the apples . The Warehouse likes you . Buildings do not have personal affinities , sir . This is not , as you will discover , just a building , Miss Wells . Welcome to Warehouse 12 . I am Caturanga . And you 're in charge here ? Oh , no ! My job is to teach and to solve puzzles , we shall say . What kind of puzzles ? Many sorts , and to design them , too . Sometimes to house a dangerous artifact , like that one . Uh-uh-ah . Sometimes , to brew the perfect cup of tea . This is England , so a good cup of tea is not hard to find . Yes , but ... The perfect cup of tea- - that 's a puzzle . I 've read some of your stories . You are very gifted . I thought my imagination knew no boundary , but to stand here , amidst this wonderment- - There 's always more to learn . I will teach you . I 'll die before I help you . Oh , you 'll help me . Whether you live or die is entirely up to you . It doesn 't get easier , does it ? To lose a fellow Agent . I 've lost fellow agents ... partners , friends , Steve ... he was my responsibility . You might have told me that he was undercover . Are you angry ? Does it matter ? There 's always a cost . What is Sykes planning ? And how are we going to stop him ? The Regents are assembling to regroup . I 'll keep you posted . The Warehouse has always endured , Arthur . Remember this watch ? Used to argue over it . I think you should have it . Good luck , old friend . I imagine you 're going to need it . You guys all right ? We are ... On the other side of the world from all right . How did they do it ? An injection . They made it look like a heart attack . Found this stuff on him . I didn 't even know the guy smoked . He didn 't . His father was a chain smoker . Steve hated smoking . That 's my boy . What is that ? Steve doing his job . Hey , guys . Bad news is if you 're watching this , I 'm probably screwed . So , I 'll keep it short . Still nothing on Sykes ' end game . He plays it pretty close to the vest . But I can tell you that he 's made travel arrangements to Hong Kong . I don 't know why . But it 's definitely not a pleasure trip . There 's one other thing . Sykes ' number two- - Marcus Diamond- - the guy who doesn 't die , something 's strange about him . He gets this look when Sykes brings out this wooden box . It 's probably an artifact . Artie , you should check it out . Agent Steve Jinks signing off . Good luck , you guys . Claude . Keep the faith . Good work , Jinxy . Indeed . Agent Jinks may have given us the final piece to the puzzle . Why ? What 's in Hong Kong ? Something we thought was gone and buried forever . Walter Sykes may have uncovered the ancient Regent Sanctum . If the Regent Sanctum was constructed during the era of Warehouse 7 , it predates H.G. by centuries . What does Sykes want with her ? No idea . All knowledge of the sanctum was purged from warehouse records when it was finally shut down for good . That was over 100 years ago . And ... if it was just a meeting place , why would he even care about it ? I got it . Three tickets to Hong Kong . Purchased from Tyler 's IP address . Three ? Sykes , Tyler , Marcus , H.G. ? Somebody did not make that trip . They 're gonna get there before us . And he has an advantage . He knows where it is , and we don 't . I found this in the Escher Vault . It was worn by the Regents of Warehouse 7 . Claudia ? See if you can get us the history on this thing . Wait . That 's the Chinese symbol for ... Aperture . Aperture could be a facility that manufactures cameras ? Or a location that acts as an aperture . Somewhere , light hits a certain way . Oh , how very Indiana Jones . The roads . The--the--the roads in- - Roads , I remember- - there 's something- - See , the roads kind of- - see that ? They connect ... In almost forms a- - Might see the- - You two know you haven 't actually finished a sentence yet , right ? Well , the same symbol that--that means aperture can also mean eye . As in ... The eye of Horus . Now , look , this is Hong Kong circa ... 1600 . These roads--the roads today , are all based on these roads . And--take a look at this . Look . The roads form an Eye of Horus . Iris of the eye . It 's a city . Tai Po . Good a place to start as any . We 'll , uh , we 'll check in when we get there . Claudia ... I think it 'd be a good idea- - Excuse me . Claudia ? You have every right to be angry . Agents Jinks was a good man . And what happened was a tragedy . And ? And what ? And I 'm really sorry I sent him to his death ? Steve died alone . Cut off from everybody who had his back . And for what ? Why ? Agent Jinks did not want to put any of you at risk . He volunteered for- - To take down Walter Sykes for the good of the world . But let 's face it , Jane . This was never about the good of the world , was it ? This was about your guilt . You made Walter Sykes . No , Claudia . I tried to prevent Walter Sykes from being made . If we had gotten to the artifact in time- - But you didn 't and he became a psychopathic killer . And now all you care about is fixing your mistake , no matter who gets hurt or killed along the way . That 's not true ! It 's just not- - You 're upset . This is not the time to discuss whether Agent Jinks was- - Steve ! His name was Steve . You know , I see you and the Regents for what you really are . Cowards . Steve was worth a thousand of you . This is exactly where the eye would be , but maybe it 's just a restaurant . Then why did I get a vibe that almost knocked me over ? I 'm here in a Chinese restaurant , Myks . And I 'm not hungry . I know there 's something here . We--we are at the dead center of the city , and- - What ? What is it ? If the sanctum was built that long ago ... What if the restaurant isn 't the sanctum ? What if it 's on top ... of the sanctum ? Well , I would say that we 're in the right place . What do you got ? Well , I doubt H.G. and a stock boy wear the same locket . Somebody there ? Nothing . I don 't know . Maybe they realized it was the wrong place and left . But ... why do I still have a vibe ? Because H.G. left that locket as a clue . I know it . Pete ? Yeah ? Look at this . It looks like something swept across the floor . What is it ? A--like a- - a door , or ... Opening ? Maybe we can- - the Eye of Horus . I believe the phrase is aha . Please , Mr. Sykes , don 't make me do this . Tyler , make the move the lady suggested . Now . This is lunacy . It 's not a move . It 's a guess . I don 't care . We don 't know if we don 't play . Now move that piece . The first two were wrong . The third could- - Enough ! Tyler , what are you waiting for ? Look at those skulls . They 're all cracked in half . Yeah , I think I see why . Please , Mr. Sykes . Don 't make him do it . Tyler , you got to be in it to win it . Now . Good lad . Checkmate . No ! First show 's over . Lattimer and Bering ? Come on down ! Myka , are you all right ? I didn 't do that . No , I 'm--I 'm fine . Myka , that 's only because I control where she shot . Next time , her aim is going to be a lot better . Okay ? Let 's go , guys . Guns on the floor , please ? Or the next shot is going to be right between Ms. Bering 's beautiful eyes . You son of a- - Stop it ! I don 't understand . Why is there a torture device in the Regent Sanctum ? It 's not a torture device , honey . It 's a lock . It was invented by a man named Caturanga . He was rather the Claudia of Warehouse 12 and my teacher . That 's why you needed Helena to open it . She 's the only living person who knew this ... Caturanga . See , the pieces are set so the player 's in check . You win the game , and the lock opens . You lose the game , and your skull opens . When the Regents shut down the Sanctum a century ago , Caturanga designed the lock . Now , the secret to opening it is not in the journals . But he writes a lot about Ms. Wells , here . She 's his favorite student . I think she knows about it . Caturanga taught me a thousand things , but I have never seen the chess lock before . I don 't know how to open it . I know , and you clearly demonstrated with young Tyler , here . You did that . I tried to stop you ! I swear it . You know what ? Maybe I used the wrong incentive . No ! Myka ! Myka ! Now that there 's somebody in the chair you care about , maybe your memory will come back . What is that ? A gift from a former employer . What do you want from me ? I 'm just an innkeeper . Oh , we both know you 're more than that , don 't we ? If you think that I 'm gonna help you break into the warehouse , you 're in for a surprise . No . No , you see , it 's you people who are gonna be surprised . What is that ? Something 's wrong at Leena 's . Pull up the security feed . Way ahead of you . It 's him . Leena . Ah ! All right , all right . If we unlock this thing , what are we going to find ? You 'll see . Have you considered that we might be unlocking an artifact deemed too dangerous to be kept in Warehouse 7 ? She 's right , you know . The Regents must have had a reason to keep people out . Don 't tell me about the Regents or the reasons , okay ? You have one choice . Open the lock , or she 's gonna die . Now , how do we beat it ? This was Caturanga 's passion . We played every day for years . You beat him all the time ? Not once . Oh , great . All right . Time to make a move . With Tyler , I--I chose the King 's gambit . Caturanga would have expected that . Perhaps- - yes , perhaps the--the Dragon 's variant . Myka , King 's Knight ... to E-6 . Check . You 're distracting the player , Pete . Queen 's Bishop ... to h-4 . Check . I don 't know what else to do ! Helena . Continuing . Sorry , Myka . Helena , listen to me . I am not going to die here today , okay ? Because you are going to take a breath , and you 're gonna save my life . This isn 't what I signed up for . These Regents of yours are gravely mistaken if they think I shall be carrying around this . The Webley Mark One .450 caliber , standard issue of the Royal Navy and police constabularies . A fine weapon . Guns have no place in a civilized society , sir . Now , the Regents set the rules , and their rules states all warehouse agents must carry a firearm . But there is always an alternative to killing . I agree . That is not standard issue . I changed the rules . Wells , time for target practice . Is he dead ? No , no . Agent McShane is merely stunned . When the rules do not agree with one , it is sometimes necessary to change them . Change the rules . What ? Change the rules . Myka , D-3 ... to E-8 . Helena , I-I- - I can 't move my pawn like that . I know . Change the rules . Checkmate . Whatever it is , I think it 's about to open . Do it . Artie , what 's that ? Black Barty 's Cannon . Black Barty ? Black Barty was one of the most successful pirate captains of the golden age . And his cannon from his ship was rumored to have artifact-augmented firepower . Are you telling me that Walter Sykes ' plan is to fire a cannonball at the Warehouse ? A cannonball wouldn 't worry me , but a cannonball from that cannon ? I 'm approaching worry . I 'm not . What the hell 's happening ? What just happened ? The Remati Shackle sensed an attack and activated a protective barrier around the Warehouse . We 're safe . I gotta get to Leena 's . Once the shackle is activated , I 'm afraid no one can get in or out . Claudia ! I want you to- - Artie , I have a bad feeling . I have a bad vibe . But you said that nothing could get in once the barrier was up . True , but it can 't stop something that 's already inside . The Regents wanted to know our vulnerability . I think we just found it . Amazing . The warehouse . You guys ! Run ! Bastard . No ! No . They must have shut it down from the other side . I hope you don 't mind . I let myself in . Initiating the barrier automatically triggered the emergency exit portal- - To the ancient sanctum . When the Regents abandoned the portal , they locked it up , but it wasn 't enough just to trigger on one side . You had to unlock the Hong Kong side as well . Which is why you needed H.G. You 'd have been proud of her . She only killed one guy doing it . Peter , are you hurt ? No . A little tired of this guy , though . You 'll never get what you want . Difference of opinion , Jane . See , I think I 'm gonna get exactly what I want . Artie , no ! Oh ! Artie ! That 'll be your only warning . Play nice . Artie , I 'm sorry . It 's his crop . It 's got wicked mojo . Are you okay ? I 've been better . Why don 't you just kill us ? I 'm going to . But we 're going to go find the Collodi Bracelet , first . And this time , Jane , you 're going to watch your son hand it to me . There 's gotta be another way to open this . I just- - I have to think . Myka , I 'm sorry . About what ? You should have destroyed the Janus coin the moment you found it . Then I wouldn 't have caused all of this . I wish that you would stop doing that . Doing what ? You 're not the bad guy , okay ? I believed in you , and I was right . So get off your--your cross , and help me figure this out . Righty-ho , then . Old times , Wells and Bering , solving puzzles , saving the day . Bering and Wells . There are consequences to using the Collodi Bracelet . There were consequences to not using it . It 's a part of me . I close my eyes , and I can see it . Without it , there 's a hole in my soul . That 's what it does to you . It 's not real . It 's not a real need . It is real to me ! Oh , no . Or did you not know that , Jane ? Wearing the bracelet creates a insatiable longing- - It hardens your heart . It darkens your soul . And if we let you keep the bracelet , you never would have been able to love , or be loved . If you did everything right , then why are we here ? We didn 't get to you soon enough . The seeds of darkness had already taken root . You 've killed a lot of people , Walter . But I take responsibility for that . Oh , that 's big of you , Jane . It 's not too late . We could still try to save you . Mom , please . I don 't think you 're going to hurt me . I think you understand what I 'm saying . I think you know there 's been enough damage done . I think you 're ready to stop this . But , Jane , then you 'd have solace . I want you to feel the guilt and the pain . Like I have . You should have opted for the opportunity I just gave you . I will take the risk . And the bracelet . Pete ? Marcus . I have it . Go ahead . You 'll never win . Pete and Myka and the others- - they 'll fight back . Possibly . But you would have had a heart attack by then . Put that syringe down , Mr. Diamond . I 'm impressed . Imagine my delight . Drop it , please . It 's about time . I didn 't think you 'd let me kill her . And I knew you 'd wait for me . You never should have come . I made you a promise a long time ago . I honor my commitments . This is Marcus Diamond , former Baltimore City Detective . Shot in the line of duty . Three times . Dead center . And you lived ? Bullets are still in his heart . If you know that much about me , you know that metal won 't kill me . Yes . But it will cause you unending pain . You have no idea what 's about to happen . Oh , but I do . Finally . Right where it belongs . You got what you wanted . Get out . No , this is just step one . Before you die , I want you to know what it feels like when something you love is ripped away from you . No , please . I 'm responsible . Kill me . Myka , thank God ! Come on ! You guys , circle around . Don 't let him in the portal . Myka ! H.G. ! Rigging rope from the Mary Celeste . Hang on . No , Myka , don 't- - Touch the rope ? I imagine it 's the rest of that sentence . If you pull at it , it only gets tighter . Oh , that 's good to know . Will you ever learn not to play with these things ? Let 's go . Hey ... You 're too young to have seen the Frazier Ali fight , right ? What ? They never saw his right uppercut coming . You know I think we 're beyond needing to make your death look like an accident . No ! Claudia , what is that ? No . This is Johann Maelzel 's metronome . Sykes uses it to keep Marcus alive . That was for Steve . Thank God , Myka left it open . Get away from her ! Walk into this ! Walter ! Walter , take my hand . Mom . Are you- - are you okay ? Yes . You ? Yeah . Walter Sykes has left the building . The portal 's kaput . And you 're gonna need to fly back . All right , so , get home safe , okay ? And , um , Mom . I love you . I love you , too , honey . Pete ! What happened ? Where are they ? What took you guys so long ? Just lazy , I guess . Sykes ? - Dead . - Is Jane all right ? Well , she 's got a 15-hour plane ride ahead of her , but , yeah , she 's okay . Thank you . Anytime . Claude , hey . Are you okay ? Yes , and so are Leena and Mrs. Frederic . Marcus is dead . It 's over . Why is that light still- - What--what is it ? They 're all- - Artie ? Artie , what 's wrong ? Wait . Mrs. Frederic . How long should the barrier normally stay active ? Once the danger to the Warehouse passes , it dissipates instantly . Well , then , why is it still up ? The Warehouse isn 't in danger anymore . Is it ? Was he just gonna collect the Collodi artifact and walk out of here ? He said he was gonna kill us all , but he never tried to . A man who can walk does not need- - He planned on leaving it behind . Yeah , but why ? Uh-oh . I know that writing . That 's from the House of Commons in London . Oh , no . How bad ? The House of Commons was partially destroyed during the Blitzkrieg of World War II . And there was a piece of masonry . It was said to absorb the concussive force of the entire German Luftwaffe . This is an artifact nuclear device ... and it 's counting down . The Ovoid quarantine can offer some protection to the rest of the Warehouse , but I-I doubt it . I don 't understand . I mean , who builds a force field that locks you in ? Well , the barrier was initiated first ... as a way ... of dealing with external danger . The barrier 's still active . All right , the primary function of the Warehouse is to protect the world 's artifacts , but the barrier , now , its mandate has shifted- - To containing the blast and protecting the world from an artifact fallout and- - If there is a big , ugly explosion , and unfortunately , if there are agents inside , that 's just collateral damage . There 's less than two minutes left on the detonator . All right . Let me at that thing . I 'm not finding anything yet . Keep looking . Something 's gotta neutralize that bomb . Something . Can 't find anything on the databases , either . Okay , so why can 't we just go to the Warehouse , and find a way to break them out ? Even if we cannot stop the explosion- - We can 't get through the barrier . Besides , there isn 't time . Can I maybe hack my way in and deactivate the barrier that way ? The power isn 't derived from the main system . It 's derived from the Remati Shackle . Claudia . You 're going to have to give me back that metronome , please . Now , please . No . You know we can 't use artifacts . What I know is I 'm tired of arbitrary rules . The metronome is for Steve . I 'm bringing him back . Nope . Takes a licking and keeps on trying to kill us . Okay , the portal 's closed . There 's--there 's no back door . No , no back door outside the barrier , anyway . Come on , Myka . We 've gotten out of worse than this . No , we have--we have . There 's a solution , and we can find it . All we have to do is keep a cool head . We 'll find it in ... 56 seconds . He did say that we 'd go out together . I always figured we would . Not me . I was planning on outliving both of you lunatics . And here we go . Hey . Helena ? What are you doing ? She 's trapped us . Helena , what is this ? Sorry . It was the only way I could think to save you . What have you done ? There was no other way . An anomaly in the system allowed me to re-route a portion of the outer barrier to that spot on the floor . I just hope it lasts . You 've protected us from the blast . You should be safe now . But you 're- - you 're out there . It had to be initiated from outside the barrier . No , listen . You gotta let us help you . It doesn 't have to be this way . Yes . I smell apples . Claudia , the Warehouse- - Mrs. Frederic ! That was his plan . To destroy the entire Warehouse . We lost , Artie . We lost . Not yet . = = sync , corrected by elderman = =

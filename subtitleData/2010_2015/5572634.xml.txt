 STAR WARS00 : 00 : 43,500 THREADS OF DESTINY00 : 00 : 51,411 Ninety-four years after the battle of Endor and the death of Emperor Palpatine , the00 : 00 : 57,429 Republic has regained its power . The Jedi Order has once again established00 : 01 : 02,155 freedom and justice , and continues to train new Jedi knights on Yavin IV.00 : 01 : 07,006 Alas , the galaxy is far from a safe place . The ancient SKENVI EMPIRE00 : 01 : 11,184 is now free from Imperial control and has expanded dramatically.00 : 01 : 15,040 Officers and soldiers from the fallen Empire have deviated to the00 : 01 : 19,041 Skenvi , and their systems are proliferating.00 : 01 : 22,535 It is only the New Republic which prevents the Skenvi from taking full00 : 01 : 26,300 control over the galaxy , and thus have the powers battle incessantly.00 : 01 : 31,078 Emperor Jiles has recalled his most powerful ambassador , Lord Siege , 00 : 01 : 35,282 who is on his way to the Skenvi home world of Zarra ... 00 : 01 : 43,809 Lord Siege , 00 : 03 : 44,440 - the Emperor is awaiting your arrival at the palace . - I know he is , Major.00 : 03 : 51,744 What are his wishes ? 00 : 03 : 53,466 Republic warship approaching.00 : 04 : 07,200 Lord Siege has entered the Imperial command center.00 : 04 : 14,058 Imperial war destroyer lost.00 : 04 : 18,000 Our next acquisition , your Majesty ? 00 : 04 : 26,619 I realise that this meeting connotates to war effort in your mind , Siege , 00 : 04 : 33,657 but I haven 't called you here with that in mind.00 : 04 : 36,713 I trust you to see things through many perspectives00 : 04 : 39,905 in a situation as crucial as this.00 : 04 : 42,845 - War can be won through many means . - Such as diplomacy ? 00 : 04 : 49,489 So you 've heard . No doubt you see the obvious in a diversion like this , 00 : 04 : 55,949 even though I haven 't shared any information with you yet.00 : 05 : 00,169 - I assume that you know of the planet of Coreign ? - Naturally Sire.00 : 05 : 05,008 It is a planet ruled by a well liked monarch . Coreign has always praised peace00 : 05 : 10,316 and democracy , but strength is quite clearly not in their ... open vocabulary.00 : 05 : 17,684 I 've heard rumors that the Republic will be negotiating with them for a treaty of annexation.00 : 05 : 22,838 And you were thinking of beating them to it ? 00 : 05 : 27,814 I take it that the ore is what spawned this newfound interest for this particular planet ? 00 : 05 : 35,018 That ore is regenerative , unique in its kind . The Republic believe that obtaining the ore00 : 05 : 42,875 is what will tip the scales in their favour.00 : 05 : 46,283 And , innocent as they are , they will no doubt send00 : 05 : 52,374 Jedi representatives to charm the King and Queen into signing a treaty with them.00 : 05 : 58,417 - Jedi ? - Of course.00 : 06 : 01,006 I don 't have the benefit of sending such charming people into their embrace , 00 : 06 : 05,862 but I certainly do have the capacity of sending a warrior with a white flag.00 : 06 : 11,977 I would like you to go and press the issue for us.00 : 06 : 15,596 - I 'm growing tired of King Juster 's stalling . - When do I leave ? 00 : 06 : 20,937 Immediately . We don 't want anything stopping us from achieving this goal.00 : 06 : 26,126 Very well Your Majesty . I will take my leave.00 : 06 : 31,497 Sorry.00 : 07 : 38,800 I know I lectured you quite a bit there , Raven . But despite your errors00 : 07 : 51,328 you actually performed quite well.00 : 07 : 53,962 - You 've proven that you can handle yourself in a dogfight . - Thank you , Master Soran.00 : 08 : 00,799 If you continue doing this well , it won 't be much longer00 : 08 : 04,901 until you 're ready for the Trials.00 : 08 : 06,600 Raven ... 00 : 08 : 26,000 Raven ... 00 : 08 : 38,200 Your future lies with me.00 : 08 : 46,216 Your future lies with me.00 : 08 : 50,521 Raven , are you okay ? You look a bit dazed.00 : 08 : 58,867 - I 'm fine , Seth . - Good , because Soran wants to see you in the Council Chamber.00 : 09 : 06,541 Ok , thanks.00 : 09 : 10,784 The council has called you here to present you with an assignment.00 : 09 : 40,458 Recently , the Republic has approached the planet of Coreign00 : 09 : 44,022 with an offer of annexation.00 : 09 : 46,329 Unfortunately , the Skenvi Empire has also approached Coreign00 : 09 : 50,877 with an offer of their own.00 : 09 : 52,660 They are more likely concerned with the planet 's resources , 00 : 09 : 56,739 its unique ore , than they are with the people.00 : 09 : 59,679 the only reason that we are approaching Coreign now00 : 10 : 03,023 - is because of their ore . - Remember the stakes here.00 : 10 : 06,322 If the Skenvi were to gain exclusive rights to Coreign 's ore00 : 10 : 11,123 the Republic will be that much closer to losing this war.00 : 10 : 16,341 Don 't remind me . I 've been in the front lines.00 : 10 : 21,682 We 're barely holding our own as it is.00 : 10 : 26,688 May the Force be with you.00 : 10 : 33,002 Another mission , Master ? This is overkill.00 : 10 : 48,817 I must admit , I did feel something in the Force when we returned , hence my suggestion that you should get some rest.00 : 10 : 57,118 - But I was looking forward to continuing my studies . - You will still be able to.00 : 11 : 01,622 A firm grasp of diplomacy can often be a Jedi 's greatest asset.00 : 11 : 07,302 Having the strength and skill to win a fight00 : 11 : 10,696 is not nearly as important as being able to avoid one in the first place.00 : 11 : 15,732 Now , go pack your things , and we 'll leave as soon as you 're ready.00 : 11 : 21,050 You two boys must be the Jedi I 'm transporting.00 : 11 : 45,543 The name 's Karus Kahn . I will be your pilot for this mission.00 : 11 : 50,178 I am Soran Darr . This is my apprentice , Raven Darkham.00 : 11 : 54,783 Nice to meet you both . If you 'll follow me , we can be on our way.00 : 11 : 59,021 You look beautiful today , Arianna.00 : 12 : 42,578 - You say that every day , mother . - It 's because you look beautiful every day.00 : 12 : 49,019 Is something wrong , dear ? 00 : 12 : 53,276 - I 'm to be Queen of Coreign . I 'm to marry a handsome young man00 : 12 : 59,297 from one of the noble Houses.00 : 13 : 01,888 It isn 't that I don 't like this life ; I do.00 : 13 : 05,606 I mean , everything about my future is already decided for me.00 : 13 : 09,107 You want to be something beyond what you were given.00 : 13 : 13,105 I know the feeling . I never wanted to marry your father.00 : 13 : 18,500 I had it set in my mind that I would fall in love with a man , and then marry him , 00 : 13 : 22,932 regardless of what my parents wanted.00 : 13 : 24,777 - So your parents forced you to marry ? - No.00 : 13 : 27,674 They gave me all the time I needed to make my decision , and your father courted me00 : 13 : 31,818 for nearly a year.00 : 13 : 33,496 And in the end , I realized I hadn 't even given Juster a chance.00 : 13 : 39,140 Sometimes , Arianna , we grow to love the roles we are forced to.00 : 13 : 47,325 - Something else bothers you ? - Yes ... Do you know that feeling you get when00 : 13 : 53,277 - someone is watching you ? - Yes . Why ? 00 : 13 : 58,207 The Ambassador from the Skenvi Empire is here to see you , m 'lady.00 : 14 : 10,171 Maybe you should handle this matter , my dear . As a queen , 00 : 14 : 16,000 you 'll have to deal with such people , whether you like them or not.00 : 14 : 19,141 And it might even irk his Lordship when he finds out that00 : 14 : 21,950 I didn 't even take the time to see him.00 : 14 : 24,370 It will be alright.00 : 14 : 28,618 - I will see him in the Main Hall . - Of course.00 : 14 : 36,281 Welcome , Ambassador . I am Princess Arianna.00 : 14 : 54,691 - You asked for an audience ... - With the King and Queen , child.00 : 14 : 59,023 Are they otherwise occupied , or do my rank and status earn me nothing more00 : 15 : 05,158 - than calculated insults ? - My parents will be meeting00 : 15 : 09,060 Jedi Knights from the New Republic today to discuss Coreign joining the Republic , 00 : 15 : 13,330 - and if that happens ... - Ah , the vaunted freedoms of the New Republic.00 : 15 : 18,585 I see that sovereignty , however , isn 't one of them.00 : 15 : 23,582 The Empire , on the other hand , encourages all00 : 15 : 27,476 profitable trade relationships , so long as our systems put00 : 15 : 32,501 - Skenvi interests first . - The Republic has our best00 : 15 : 35,416 interests at heart ... While as far as I can tell , the Skenvi are only00 : 15 : 40,286 - interested in our minerals . - You malign us , my lady . We fear for the health00 : 15 : 45,210 of your economy . The Republic is small , and simply cannot provide you00 : 15 : 51,101 with the market you require . The Empire can , 00 : 15 : 55,970 but if you join the Republic , and you are00 : 15 : 59,123 forced to embargo us , the consequences for your people will be disastrous.00 : 16 : 07,256 But of course , I have faith that your family will make the wiser choice.00 : 16 : 13,348 After all , the King and Queen do have the best interests of the people at heart.00 : 16 : 20,134 Your skills with the saber are progressing quite well.00 : 17 : 04,331 We are coming up on Coreign . We 'll be leaving00 : 17 : 07,000 hyperspace in a few seconds.00 : 17 : 09,668 Master , now that I am done my studies00 : 17 : 19,970 I wish to discuss something with you.00 : 17 : 22,199 I had a dream earlier . It was clear , vivid , 00 : 17 : 26,415 - not like my other dreams ... - A vision ? 00 : 17 : 29,736 Maybe . I don 't know.00 : 17 : 35,236 A Jedi must always be mindful00 : 17 : 37,381 of his dreams , Raven.00 : 17 : 39,361 Especially when they 're out of the ordinary.00 : 17 : 43,818 Consider what you saw , meditate on it.00 : 17 : 48,746 We will discuss this when we settle in on Coreign.00 : 17 : 55,704 Coreign Air Traffic Control , this is00 : 18 : 23,330 the light freighter StarStream , requesting permission to land.00 : 18 : 26,412 I am carrying the Republic ambassadors.00 : 18 : 29,240 Ambassador.00 : 19 : 14,073 I am Captain Turvo of the Royal Guard.00 : 19 : 17,053 My men and I will escort you to the palace.00 : 19 : 22,154 I hear the King and Queen are well loved by the people.00 : 19 : 29,800 They are indeed.00 : 19 : 31,100 I 'm afraid you won 't be meeting with them right away , however.00 : 19 : 33,700 - No ? - No . They will be available for an audience later today.00 : 19 : 37,900 But they have requested that you first meet with their daughter , the Princess Arianna.00 : 19 : 41,400 Well of course . A future Queen will no doubt need00 : 19 : 45,322 to practice her skills of diplomacy.00 : 19 : 47,200 Follow me , young Jedi . The Princess is in the Throne Room.00 : 20 : 01,820 You must be the Jedi I am meeting with . I am00 : 20 : 43,860 - Princess Arianna . - My ... 00 : 20 : 49,872 My name is Raven Darkham.00 : 20 : 52,841 - You 're so nervous . - I must admit , I 've00 : 20 : 56,391 never met a princess before.00 : 20 : 58,280 I too have a confession . I 've never met a Jedi Knight before.00 : 21 : 01,684 Actually m 'lady , you still haven 't . I 'm not quite a Jedi Knight yet . I 'm00 : 21 : 06,257 - only a student . - If you are a student , then where is your master ? 00 : 21 : 11,053 He is around someplace . He trusted me to handle the matter alone.00 : 21 : 15,914 You may come sit next to me , Raven Darkham.00 : 21 : 23,751 Don 't worry . My parents will not mind00 : 21 : 29,719 us using their seats.00 : 21 : 32,624 So what exactly does a Jedi do ? 00 : 21 : 38,686 We 're peacekeepers and ambassadors ... 00 : 21 : 40,573 - They seem to get along well . - Yes , I must say.00 : 21 : 45,396 I 'm gratified to find that the Republic deems us00 : 21 : 49,120 important enough to send two Jedi as ambassadors.00 : 21 : 52,803 - Every system is important to the Republic . - But some more than most , no ? 00 : 21 : 57,476 What would the Republic say if we were to join the Skenvi instead , 00 : 22 : 02,281 and deny you access to our ore ? 00 : 22 : 05,369 If you want to join the Skenvi Empire , 00 : 22 : 08,119 it 's your right to do so.00 : 22 : 10,072 If I would like to take a stroll out00 : 22 : 11,986 of that window , it 's also my right.00 : 22 : 15,795 A fine assessment of the situation.00 : 22 : 21,069 You 're in the fleet as well ? 00 : 22 : 24,098 What can I say ? We Jedi are ... versatile.00 : 22 : 29,514 Not to mention insufferably self-centered.00 : 22 : 32,571 And here I was trying to discuss important affairs with you.00 : 22 : 35,594 Very well , then . Why does Coreign wish to join with the Republic ? 00 : 22 : 41,867 There are rumors of an invasion if we do not cooperate.00 : 22 : 45,022 The Republic would be able to defend us , as we do not have00 : 22 : 47,685 the forces nor the resources to defend ourselves.00 : 22 : 50,556 Plus , it 's good to have a Jedi on our side.00 : 22 : 56,892 I guess that concludes our business . I will relay your answers00 : 23 : 04,607 - to the Senate . - Thank you . And now with the business00 : 23 : 08,714 out of the way , would you like to see the Royal Gardens ? 00 : 23 : 11,459 I am retiring there now and would love for a Jedi to accompany me.00 : 23 : 14,778 Lead the way , m 'lady.00 : 23 : 17,424 And this is where I like to practice my fencing . What 's so funny ? 00 : 23 : 35,653 I 'm sorry but , I just can 't imagine a princess fencing ! 00 : 23 : 39,231 Would you like to see ? Would you like to have00 : 23 : 42,777 - a friendly duel ? - I accept.00 : 23 : 46,116 Young love . Touching , isn 't it ? 00 : 24 : 03,046 Do you know , your Grace , what Jedi philosophy says00 : 24 : 06,163 - about attachments ? - Perhaps you could enlighten us , 00 : 24 : 10,393 - Lord Siege . - It says that a Jedi must forsake00 : 24 : 14,898 all attachments , that he may better serve the Force.00 : 24 : 19,442 That is why candidates for their Academy are taken at such a young age , 00 : 24 : 23,627 and why they are forbidden to love.00 : 24 : 28,406 And yet the Jedi Master throws his apprentice headlong00 : 24 : 36,697 into your romantic trap , knowing full well what the outcome will be.00 : 24 : 44,043 Perhaps , your Grace , it would do you well to remember this , as a lesson.00 : 24 : 48,867 - A lesson about what ? - The quickest judgment about a man may often00 : 24 : 53,624 prove to be the farthest from the truth.00 : 24 : 56,046 I think my judgments about you and the Skenvi Empire00 : 25 : 01,364 is quite sound.00 : 25 : 03,553 Here ! 00 : 25 : 16,769 It 's a bit different than a lightsaber , 00 : 25 : 25,884 but it 'll do.00 : 25 : 29,211 - Are you ready ? - As ready as I 've ever been , Princess.00 : 25 : 36,735 Remember , don 't hold back.00 : 25 : 45,349 I see you 're learning.00 : 26 : 15,595 If you think spouting platitudes ... 00 : 26 : 18,216 But if I were you , I would look carefully00 : 26 : 21,162 - at my new allies . - Which is why00 : 26 : 24,965 the Coreign will never join the Skenvi.00 : 26 : 29,022 No less than I expected . When the end00 : 26 : 32,991 comes , your Grace , you may reconsider00 : 26 : 35,185 your words , although it will be far too late.00 : 26 : 38,747 - Are you threatening us ? - When Skenvi warships00 : 26 : 42,487 occupy your orbitals , when your cities are awash in flame , 00 : 26 : 47,969 when you find yourself a king over nothing but00 : 26 : 50,381 ashes and memories , perhaps you will00 : 26 : 53,444 look back and wish that you had chosen00 : 26 : 56,264 a position of strength over one of weakness.00 : 26 : 59,510 Coreign is merely an objective in this war , a resource00 : 27 : 03,973 to be fought over . Strip away the self-righteous web of lies , 00 : 27 : 09,164 and you will find that the Republic feels much the same way.00 : 27 : 14,006 And what of you when you become a burden to your new allies , 00 : 27 : 18,287 your new friends ? Coreign is weak , 00 : 27 : 24,106 and in this galaxy , your Grace , weakness invites betrayal.00 : 27 : 33,103 You 're really good.00 : 28 : 06,305 That was quite the show.00 : 28 : 26,897 You 're very talented , Princess.00 : 28 : 34,948 I 'm sure Soran and his student are exhausted00 : 28 : 40,911 from their trip here and could use some bit of a rest.00 : 28 : 45,611 Arianna , would you be so kind to show them00 : 28 : 48,880 - to the Guest Rooms ? - Certainly , Father.00 : 28 : 50,890 If you 'll follow me , gentlemen.00 : 28 : 54,309 Princess , your parents say that you are very perceptive00 : 29 : 26,193 towards others ' feelings . Do you often have strong emotions towards others00 : 29 : 31,879 only by their presence , or perhaps know that they 're nearby00 : 29 : 36,766 - before you can hear or see them ? - All the time . Mother says00 : 29 : 40,756 it 's a gift that I have been blessed with.00 : 29 : 43,277 Here is your room , gentlemen . Take as long as you need to rest.00 : 29 : 51,013 My parents will meet with you afterwards , 00 : 29 : 52,649 to finalize the negotiations.00 : 29 : 54,967 Your hospitality is much appreciated.00 : 29 : 57,584 - Rest well . - I will.00 : 30 : 01,740 - The Force is strong in her . - I know . I felt it when we00 : 30 : 25,341 were fencing.00 : 30 : 27,238 But it 's too late for her to begin the training.00 : 30 : 34,553 The Council has made exceptions in the past.00 : 30 : 48,305 I 'll speak to Master Joran Korn when we return.00 : 30 : 52,664 You 've fallen for the boy , haven 't you ? 00 : 31 : 15,353 I 'm happy for you , but there is one thing you must know.00 : 31 : 21,076 The Jedi ... members of the Order are not allowed to get involved , romantically , at all.00 : 31 : 29,938 Maybe it 's better if you don 't attend the finalizing00 : 31 : 36,669 of the negotiations.00 : 31 : 38,613 Your father and I can handle it on our own.00 : 31 : 42,255 My dear , forget about him.00 : 31 : 50,309 Falaish ! 00 : 32 : 07,255 Could you please go and remind my wife about the meeting ? She was last headed00 : 32 : 19,064 - toward the Princess ' quarters . - Certainly , your Grace.00 : 32 : 23,762 Raven , how about you accompany her . You won 't be missing much here.00 : 32 : 29,423 Certainly , master.00 : 32 : 32,464 Stay here.00 : 32 : 50,017 Go and get my master ! 00 : 33 : 34,271 The Queen is dead and the Princess is missing ! 00 : 33 : 49,711 - Raven , stop ! - Why ? We don 't have time for this ! 00 : 34 : 27,547 There ! 00 : 34 : 29,630 Stop right there.00 : 34 : 42,668 Jedi scum ! 00 : 34 : 45,042 Don 't touch the princess.00 : 35 : 30,764 I know your tricks . Sith.00 : 35 : 47,594 You and your outdated Jedi Order , know nothing ! 00 : 35 : 52,997 Time 's up ! 00 : 36 : 23,480 Master ! 00 : 36 : 55,123 Arianna has always been strong . So if anyone could00 : 37 : 42,931 survive this , it 's her.00 : 37 : 45,861 We will do what we can to return her safely.00 : 37 : 50,403 But your Grace , please , do not let this interfere00 : 37 : 54,622 with the negotiations.00 : 37 : 57,287 You have received the demands of the Skenvi Empire , 00 : 38 : 06,761 but please ... do not listen . We will get00 : 38 : 14,251 - your daughter back . - I swear we will00 : 38 : 16,416 return her . And kill the man00 : 38 : 18,997 that did this.00 : 38 : 20,476 The man you are seeking is named Lord Siege . He is an00 : 38 : 25,809 ambassador of the Skenvi Empire . I wish both of you00 : 38 : 30,730 the best of luck . And please bring my daughter back00 : 38 : 35,157 safely . She is all I have now.00 : 38 : 40,713 Come on.00 : 38 : 43,713 And what 's more , we confronted him on Coreign , 00 : 39 : 40,008 and found out that he is schooled in the ways of the Force.00 : 39 : 43,841 A lone Dark Jedi , if we are lucky.00 : 39 : 45,428 - But you don 't believe so ? - No . He disguised himself A lone Dark Jedi , if we are lucky.00 : 39 : 46,166 - But you don 't believe so ? - No . He disguised himself00 : 39 : 50,778 too well , fought too masterfully.00 : 39 : 54,289 - He 's a Sith . - This is dire news , indeed.00 : 40 : 00,552 I will discuss this with the Council , but you must do everything that you can00 : 40 : 06,696 to find out more about this man . Pursue him , rescue the princess , 00 : 40 : 10,320 if she is not sold or dead already.00 : 40 : 12,861 But above all else , be careful . You might be00 : 40 : 16,950 in more danger than you realise.00 : 40 : 20,382 - What else is troubling you ? - It 's Raven.00 : 40 : 28,310 He has become ... emotionally attached.00 : 40 : 34,891 Watch him then . Closely . His involvement with her00 : 40 : 39,882 can be dealt with later.00 : 40 : 40,882 For now , you must make sure that this quest of yours does not become an instrument of vengeance00 : 40 : 49,583 - for him . - I agree.00 : 40 : 52,772 - Contact me when you know more . - I will.00 : 40 : 57,431 Chancellor Dorren , what can I do for you ? 00 : 41 : 03,669 The Coreign queen has been murdered , 00 : 41 : 05,490 and her daughter kidnapped by the Skenvi00 : 41 : 08,497 ambassador Lord Siege .

Her screaming is00 : 42 : 09,292 enough to give even womp rats a headache.00 : 42 : 12,013 Not yet . I 'd like to have a few words with the princess first.00 : 42 : 17,257 I see that breaking you will take more than just physical pain.00 : 42 : 27,282 The Force can do terrible things to both00 : 42 : 30,261 mind and flesh . Twist you in ways you never thought possible.00 : 42 : 37,086 But for now I will leave you with the threat of such agony.00 : 42 : 42,312 Tell me , Princess : If I were to disable the binds and free you , 00 : 42 : 49,143 - what would you do ? - I would kill you.00 : 42 : 53,029 Such violence ... such hate .

You , Princess , are strong in the Force . Very strong.00 : 43 : 14,537 With sufficient training , even I would be hard-pressed00 : 43 : 19,545 - to match you . - Is that what you want ? 00 : 43 : 21,759 - To turn me into a Sith ? - In time , yes.00 : 43 : 26,463 But I think you will find your alternatives rather00 : 43 : 29,546 limited in that regard .

In what system ? 00 : 46 : 40,218 It seems our boy is taking the Princess to Emperta.00 : 46 : 45,043 It 's a space station that operates00 : 46 : 49,699 within the black market.00 : 46 : 51,205 More specifically , with slave dealing.00 : 46 : 54,075 We have to get there right away ! 00 : 46 : 56,204 Thank you , Karus .

Your feeling toward this girl00 : 47 : 33,004 has clouded your judgment.00 : 47 : 35,286 Your only concern should be about what helps00 : 47 : 38,193 bring Coreign into the Republic.00 : 47 : 40,709 But you are turning it into a personal quest for revenge.00 : 47 : 45,449 You fear for the girl , and you 're angry00 : 47 : 49,317 at our inability to immediately rescue her.00 : 47 : 52,386 You hate Lord Siege for what he 's doing00 : 47 : 55,017 to her , to you ! 00 : 47 : 56,916 You hate him with a passion that00 : 47 : 59,003 - threatens to consume you . - I 've heard this all before.00 : 48 : 03,791 Is wanting justice for what he 's done going to lead00 : 48 : 07,299 - to the Dark Side ? - This is not justice that you want ! 00 : 48 : 10,238 It 's vengeance !

When you can ignore the pain , 01 : 08 : 00,499 it all seems to go away.01 : 08 : 02,846 I can 't imagine a Jedi like you acting01 : 08 : 04,939 as childish as me over such a01 : 08 : 06,458 - small thing . - Jedi have years of training01 : 08 : 08,499 to ignore pain.01 : 08 : 10,456 But just between you and me , even a simple cut can drive01 : 08 : 15,796 the strongest of Jedi insane at times.01 : 08 : 18,669 Your parents must be so proud of you.01 : 08 : 20,326 Actually , they don 't know much01 : 08 : 23,163 about me . I was taken from my home planet when I was01 : 08 : 26,426 three years old , to become a Jedi Knight.01 : 08 : 30,462 I haven 't seen my parents since.01 : 08 : 33,610 I plan on going back to my home planet after I become a full Jedi Knight.01 : 08 : 38,405 I can 't imagine being away from my parents01 : 08 : 39,960 for that long.01 : 08 : 42,715 That monster ... He murdered my mother.01 : 08 : 50,724 He tortured me . He said he would ... 01 : 08 : 55,725 It 's alright . He 's gone . You 'll never01 : 09 : 00,465 have to see him again.01 : 09 : 02,733 Never again ... 01 : 09 : 05,282 No . He 's coming.01 : 09 : 12,962 What was that ? ! 01 : 09 : 23,665 Our friends are back , and they 're not too happy01 : 09 : 26,372 with us tricking them.01 : 09 : 28,709 Faster , we should be gaining on them ! 01 : 09 : 37,094 Why haven 't we jumped to lightspeed yet ? 01 : 09 : 46,674 I need to work on the coordinates a little bit more.01 : 09 : 50,302 - Can you lose him ? - Maybe . There 's an01 : 09 : 53,726 asteroid field up ahead . We can take cover there.01 : 09 : 57,076 Faster ! 01 : 10 : 25,791 You can 't possibly escape , Jedi . Would you throw away the lives of the Princess01 : 10 : 46,304 and your smuggler friend just for a chance01 : 10 : 49,138 - to save yourself ? - You 'll never have the Princess , Sith.01 : 10 : 51,828 If you want her , you 'll have to get past me first ! 01 : 10 : 55,255 Buckle yourselves in.01 : 10 : 58,207 This may get bumpy.01 : 11 : 15,396 Leave this to me ! 01 : 11 : 37,569 What are you doing ? ! 01 : 12 : 39,028 - Okay , let 's go to lightspeed . - Not quite yet.01 : 14 : 16,260 The boy again.Always the boy ... 01 : 15 : 05,066 I got a feeling that you were piloting , Raven . That was ... what 's wrong ? 01 : 15 : 52,063 Siege ... he 's dead . It 's all over and I01 : 15 : 59,472 never even saw him.01 : 16 : 01,852 Revenge is never as satisfying as we believe01 : 16 : 05,579 it will be , Raven.01 : 16 : 07,476 You think it ends a conflict , settles a score , 01 : 16 : 12,827 but in fact , it only internalizes it.01 : 16 : 18,664 Take my advice and forget about it . If you don 't , you will go on01 : 16 : 24,195 hating him in the dark corners of your mind , simply because he denied you01 : 16 : 29,285 - of your satisfaction . - Yes , master.01 : 16 : 32,138 I will try not to dwell on it.01 : 16 : 34,900 - Where 's Coreign ? - I don 't know.01 : 17 : 04,743 The ship just came out of hyperspace on its own.01 : 17 : 07,936 Seems we exited prematurely . We 're still a day away01 : 17 : 12,804 from the planet.01 : 17 : 15,063 That asteroid impact must have damaged the hyperdrive.01 : 17 : 29,801 - Is there anything you can do to fix it ? - Not until we reach01 : 17 : 33,535 Coreign . I don 't have the spare parts to fix this.01 : 17 : 36,293 You did what you could . We 'll simply have to wait.01 : 17 : 40,980 Coreign Air Traffic Control , this is the light freighter01 : 22 : 30,752 Star Stream . We have urgent business with01 : 22 : 33,383 the King , and we require docking space immediately.01 : 22 : 38,082 Coreign Air Traffic Control ? 01 : 22 : 44,419 That 's odd . They aren 't responding.01 : 22 : 48,437 I 'll stay on the ship and wait . I doubt that I 'll feel01 : 23 : 13,501 too comfortable in a Palace , surrounded by royalty.01 : 23 : 18,350 But if you could ask the King about a new01 : 23 : 20,841 hyperdrive , though , I 'd really appreciate it.01 : 23 : 24,059 I 'll ask.01 : 23 : 26,819 Wait ! 01 : 23 : 50,204 They don 't seem to want us dead.01 : 23 : 57,879 You won 't win this time , 01 : 24 : 20,271 - Siege . - Oh , but I already have.01 : 24 : 24,699 In a single blow , I have taken this planet01 : 24 : 27,346 right from the Republic 's grasp.01 : 24 : 30,054 When the King signs our treaty of annexation , the Republic will be01 : 24 : 36,068 powerless to act , and the Empire will have the advantage01 : 24 : 42,231 it needs to win this war . Which brings me to a01 : 24 : 47,350 point I 've been meaning to make for quite some time.01 : 24 : 51,211 Now that I have the King , I no longer need the Princess.01 : 24 : 57,214 - Nooo ! - Raven , no ! 01 : 25 : 00,051 Get her out of here ! Now ! 01 : 25 : 10,393 I knew it . He just used a stun blaster.01 : 25 : 49,372 You 'll be okay.01 : 25 : 51,602 Land the ship , we have to help them ! 01 : 26 : 53,593 - Land this piece of rusted junk ! - If we 're going to go back , 01 : 26 : 58,292 may I suggest we sneak in through the back of the palace ? 01 : 27 : 00,961 Assuming the Royal Guards are still alive.01 : 27 : 02,751 - Land behind the Palace ! - Yes , m 'Lady.01 : 27 : 06,015 - Have you seen the new speeder , 0513 ? - Yes , I 've seen it .

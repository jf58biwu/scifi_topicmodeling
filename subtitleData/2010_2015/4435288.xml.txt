 ♪ WEAVER : Lucas . There you are . Everything 's coming together right on schedule . Mining rigs were just delivered . - Being loaded in now . - Good . No point in any of this without those diggers . Been meaning to ask since you got back . What , um ... what happened to your ... ? Oh . Nykoraptor . Another couple of inches , it would 've had my jugular . I would 've been lunch , and you 'd be a much poorer man . Let 's not count our money yet . A lot still has to go right before we even get to Terra Nova . With the 11th Pilgrimage leaving tomorrow , security in Hope Plaza 's - gonna be extra tight . - We 'll get there . We have the best army money can buy . ♪ Adjust that vantage point ! You got a blind spot ! What 's the perimeter status ? North and South Quadrants are secure , sir . How many men we got in the tree line ? 30 , sir . That 's almost a third of our force . Pull a dozen , send them back to the colony . Don 't want to spread ourselves too thin . Yes , sir . Doc , how are the med tents coming ? Yeah , we 're gonna set up further back in the clearing . We have CO2 infusers if we get pilgrims ... and a mobile trauma unit in case we get casualties . Just be ready to fall back to the colony if , uh , things go sideways . Dunham . Remember , they can only come through two at a time , threes at the most , so we use the choke point to our advantage , yes ? Yes , sir . Why not just shut this whole thing down and stop anyone from coming through ? Um , because the terminus only anchors our end here . Even if we shut it down , the time fracture would open ... somewhere else ... within about three klicks . This is our best shot at them . At least we know where they 're coming through . When Hope Plaza fires up that particle accelerator tomorrow , we 're either getting a hundred colonists looking for a new lease on life or an army bent on destroying our home . Either way ... let 's be ready . I really think we 'll be fine . I mean , a defensible location is key . It forces the enemy to play offense , which everybody knows is the more difficult position . Mark gave me a book on military strategy . Romantic . If there 's a war , can I shoot with the sonic cannon ? No , you cannot . ( laughs ) Hopefully , there 's not gonna be a war . God willing . We won 't know anything for sure until tomorrow . Besides , this family 's been through a lot together , We 'll get through this , too . All Shannons agree ? - Yes ! - Yup ! Yup ! - Hey , Dad ? - Mm-hmm ? Is there any way I can come out there with you tomorrow , in case Kara does come through ? No , I 'm sorry , It 's too dangerous . And I need you here to look after your sisters . But if Kara comes through the portal ... I 'll watch out for her . Promise . ♪ Be careful out there . I will . We 're moving out . Got to go . I love you . I love you , too . TAYLOR : All right , well , don 't forget , anything happens to the colony while I 'm gone , it 's coming right out of your paycheck . - I want to be out there with you . - Nah , nah . I need to keep you safe and sound . Wash , - who 'd stitch me up ? - All right , can the chatter . Do you have to go ? Darling , we 'll be back before you know it , okay ? Listen , if the fighting makes its way back to the colony , you hide , got it ? You take Maddy and Zoe and hide until we come find you . - JOSH : Got it . - All right . - Bye . - Bye . Patrol out !

Where are the kids ? It 's okay , they 're at home , they 're safe . There , that should help . ( sighs ) Can you hear me now ? Elisabeth , what 's going on ? The last thing I remember was the explosion . That was three days ago , Jim . Why did they set it off ? Were they trying to untether the fracture ? It reopened closer to the colony . Their army came through and headed straight for the gates . There was no way Taylor could make it back in time . But there were soldiers here , Washington . Yeah , she held them off as best she could . ( sighs ) 26 people were killed before she finally surrendered . What about Taylor ? Nobody 's heard from him . Dr. Shannon ! Bed Six is bleeding out . Go see the kids . Daddy , you 're okay , you 're okay . Of course I 'm okay . You didn 't think a little explosion would stop your old dad , did you ? I 'm so glad you 're home . Oh , my girls .

I 'm so sorry . ♪ Zoe 's finally asleep . Where is my gun ? First thing they did was confiscate all the weapons . I 'm surprised they left us with a bread knife . ( sighs ) It 's the search lights . They start at nightfall . Curfew is from 8 : 00 . It 's like being back in Golad Prison . Why go to the trouble of keeping us all here ? Why didn 't they just clear the colony out ? We 're hostages . Taylor won 't try and retake the colony if there are still civilians inside . Is anyone fighting back ? Less and less . We 're outnumbered . And anyone who does try to resist ... sent straight to the brig or worse . Is that where Washington is ? No , they keep a close eye on her , though . I think they like to have her out where people can see her . Reminds us that they 're in charge . Yeah . I got to go talk to Wash . ( indistinct chatter ) Here we are , gents . That 'll be 18 Terras . Uh , on second thought , this round 's on the house . - Yeah . - Yeah . Drink up , boys , we got thirsty work ahead of us . Wash ? Shannon ... you 're awake . They told me it didn 't look good for you . It 's okay now . Listen , I need to know what 's going on here . Who the hell are these people ? They 're the Phoenix Group . They 're private military , killers for hire . Who hired ' em ? Whoever Lucas is working for in 2149 . All I know is , they must have deep pockets to mount an operation this big . We fought ' em best that we could , but once they started shelling the colony and killing innocent people , there 's nothing I could do . Except raise the white flag . Okay , so ... what 's the plan ? Do I look like someone who has a plan to you ? No . You look like someone who 's punishing herself for doing what she had to do to save innocent lives . You got a way to contact Taylor ? No . They got this colony locked down . Nothing gets in or out without them knowing about it . They came here to strip-mine the place , but how are they gonna ship anything back to 2149 when they blew up the terminus ? They brought a new one back with them to make the fracture go both ways . Lucky for us , they had run-in with a pack of Carnos , that snapped the thing in half . Chalk one up for the Cretaceous . Yeah , well , don 't get too excited . They 're fixing it . And when I say " they , " I mean Malcolm . Listen ... These guys think it 's all over . But we can still fight them . ( whispering ) : What do you have in mind ? Oh , we hurt ' em . And we keep on hurting them till they 're gone . See , I like the sound of that . Where 's Jim Shannon ? Nurse ... this is Jim Shannon 's bed . What happened to him ? Did he not pull through ? He was stable last time I checked in on him . ( whirring and crackling ) ( gasps ) Jim . You 're awake . Yeah . So I keep hearing . This all feels like a bad dream . What are you doing here ? - Do they know you 're up and about ? - You mean Lucas and Mira ? Yeah , I mean ... You were Taylor 's right hand . They 'll be looking for you . Why are you working for them , Malcolm ? Why am I ... ? I 've been pressed into service . You 'll notice my assistant McCormick isn 't in the lab with me . See that window ? That 's where they put his head when I refused to help . Then they let him bleed out on the floor . Malcolm . I 'm sorry about McCormick . But if you fix that terminus , they 'll start shipments to 2149 . They get a taste of what Terra Nova has to offer , they 'll send more men , and more equipment , - and we won 't stand a chance . - Yeah , I know , I know . That 's why I 'm working as slowly as I can . Fortunately for us , as brilliant a physicist as Lucas is , he 's no engineer , so he hasn 't ... quite caught on yet . That 's good . Well , keep ... I don 't know , dragging it out . Hopefully it 'll buy us some time to find Taylor . ( distant footsteps ) Did you hear ... ? We 've got a problem . MIRA : Shannon 's Taylor 's go-to . He 's smart , capable ... he 's dangerous . And he might just know where Taylor is . By all means , we should talk to him . Shannon . Shannon ! Hey ! We 're talking to you . He can 't hear you . The blast took most of his hearing . Hey , Jim ? It 's okay . Here they are . I 've adjusted them for you . Now remember , stay off your feet as much as you can . Where 's my father ? Where 's ... Taylor ? Taylor ? Lucas Taylor . I know who you are . ( chuckling ) : I know who you are ! Apparently the , uh , concussion caused a sub-cranial swelling . I don 't think he even knows where he is . Yeah , he 's not going to help us find my father . Malcolm ! I want an update on how the terminus is coming . Step it up , or the next head that goes through a window is yours . - Hey . Jim ? - Huh ? Go home . Be with your family . Little early , isn 't it ? Any luck getting a signal to Hope Plaza ? Just got off with our employers . Things couldn 't be going better on their end . As far as the general public 's concerned , there was a containment breach at Hope Plaza , and the place had to be evacuated . The media 's reporting it 'll take years to clean up the radiation . Which means , as soon as the terminus is up and running , we can start shipping everything we mine through Hope Plaza , and no one will ever be the wiser . Our employers did have one request ... of you , as a matter of fact . I take it you 're familiar with an area called the Badlands ? They 'd like you to take a little trip . What for ? There 's nothing out there . Ours is not to question why . Oh , if you 'll excuse me . You can go . You wanted to see me ? You betrayed me to my father . Yeah . I did , didn 't I ? I should make an example of you , but ... I 've decided to forgive you instead , because ... I understand . He 's like a father to you , isn 't he ? Yeah , you could say that . Well , you know what that makes us , then ... brother and sister . And how could I ever hurt my sister ? Don 't betray me again . Next time , I won 't be so forgiving . SOLDIER : All right , move ! I hate them . I hate all of them . Shh ! Easy . Take it easy . We 've got to do something . We 've gotta find a way to fight back . Oh , you want to help ? Go ask Boylan for your job back . Why ? A lot of these Phoenix guys hang out at his place . Drunken soldiers talking shop . You never know what you might overhear . ( monitor beeping ) Okay , judging by the number of entry wounds , this should be the last bullet . Looks intact . Can I go ahead and close him up , then ? Dr. Shannon ? So what am I looking at here ? I pulled a couple of bullets from a Phoenix soldier they brought in after a skirmish with Taylor 's men . Look , I noticed this . That isn 't a serial number . Someone did that by hand . Yeah , so I went back and I checked all the other bullets we retrieved , and they 've all got the same number , hand-etched in the metal . Taylor , you sneaky bastard . You finally checked in . They 're map coordinates . A rendezvous point . Except now , I gotta figure out a way past those guards and get outside the gates . Hey , what ... ! That 's-that 's my rover ! And that 's my army . All right ! See this bug bite ? Yeah , I can 't even begin to describe the insect that did this to me . Some kind of winged spider-snake . What about the pyro-sonic ? Is it loaded up and ready to go ? Yes , sir . Now , careful with it . It 's the only one we 've got . Damn thing growled at me , Lucas . Pretty sure bugs aren 't supposed to growl . Let 's go ! Whoa , whoa , whoa ! ( horn blaring ) Why are we stopped ? ( horn blaring ) Hey , move out of the way . The damn motor 's dead again . Third time this month . You have to move now ! Hey , what the hell you doing ? Come on ! What are you thinking ? The guy 's in a wheelchair ! Cut him a break , why don 't you ? Move out of the way . Hey , mister , what ... have you got anything compassionate about you ? This guy is in a wheelchair . - Stand back . - All right . That 's cool ... Dr. Taylor . Mr. Weaver . WEAVER : So what are we looking at here ? 'Cause all I can see is a bunch of trees . This whole valley is rich with meteoric ore . There are impact craters everywhere . Just can 't see ' em because of the canopy . How much is out there ? Couple hundred thousand tons . - Easy . - LUCAS : See , Weaver ? Told you you were going to be a rich man . My own dome . That 's what I 'm going to do with my share . Buy my very own dome . Huh . Look at that thing . Of course , the only problem we have is the wildlife . It 's not safe to get started until we clear them out . After what those Carnos did to the terminus , can 't be too careful . There . One less problem . LUCAS : That was a brachiosaurus . They 're harmless . - Whatever . - What 's the plan ? Plant the charge about ten klicks in . Detonate from this ridge . And boom , the blast will strip the entire valley of all foliage and wildlife , so we can mine it unobstructed . Today is just a hint of what 's to come . With just ten pyro-sonics , we can strip half this continent . ( laughs ) That 's what I like to hear . Be one hell of a barbecue down here , huh ? Mr. Shannon ! Reynolds . We 've been keeping an eye on this spot for days , hoping that someone would get our message . How 's Maddy ? She okay ? The whole family 's safe . Give me your comm , ' cause I need to talk to Taylor . We got a situation . You say they 've got some kind of a pyro-sonic charge . They 're planning to detonate it from a ridge just south of Triple Junction . - Excuse me , sir . - Talk to me , Reilly . If there 's using a remote trigger , that means we can trace the signal straight to the charge . We get you there , can you defuse the damn thing ? Sooner the better . All right , let 's go , people . Hey , I 'm glad to see you 're in one piece . Likewise . All right , it 's armed . I 'll let her rip , once we 've cleared the blast radius . Very good . All right , let 's go ! Yeah , we 're heading back now . Copy that . Standing by . TAYLOR : All right , let 's get this done . Get up to that ridge , they 're gonna set this sucker off . Reilly ... I 'm on it , sir . Oh ... Huh . Never seen a decompiler like this one before . Must be Russo-Chinese . Not a lot of time for a learning curve here , Reilly . Can you do it ? Of course , sir . Lucas , come in . It 's Weaver . Go ahead . Infra-red shows movement near the charge . Please tell me you 're still down there . LUCAS : It 's my father . I knew it . Blow it , Weaver ! Set it off ! Whoa ! Hang on ! We 're still in the blast zone ! Weaver , hold on . How much farther ? Another .. three klicks . ( beeping ) What 's that ? It 's all right . Just letting me know it 's powering up . Getting ready to explode . Drive faster . And how long before it 's ... you know ... not ready to explode ? Corporal ? If everyone could just shut up for a second . Sir . Reynolds , they 're approaching the ridge . REYNOLDS : Copy that . They 're almost clear of the blast zone , sir . Fire up the Rhino . One way or the other , we 're leaving in a hurry . All right , we 're almost clear , Weaver . Just blow the damn thing . Just a few more seconds . ( beeps , whirrs ) ( sighs ) Done . ( laughs ) What the hell happened ? Either this detonator 's broken , or your father defused the bomb . Good job , Corporal . Secure the pyro-sonic and let 's get out of here . ( beeping ) Incoming ! Everybody all right back there ? Yes , sir . All good , sir . Son of a bitch ! JIM : We lost 26 before the colony fell . 26 dead ? ( sighs ) We lost two our first night here before we had a chance to secure the perimeter . Carnotaurs ... they got Bailey and Gonzalez . He was 22 years old . Good kid . Good soldier . As I understand it , Gonzalez was engaged to be married . How 's Wash holding up ? She 's been better . She , uh , she feels like she let you down . Nah . She made the only decision she could , Surrender the colony . Tell her I said so . I will . You should be getting back before they miss you . Take this . Stay in touch . I got it on a rotating frequency . There 's no way they can lock in on it . So , uh , what now , Commander ? We just keep on hitting ' em . We won this round , but this ain 't over . Not by a long shot . ( door opens ) JIM : Train station ... Found him wandering around the wrong side of the perimeter . - Where 's the train station ? - It 's okay , Dad . - It 's not there anymore . - Let me help you . Next time , keep an eye on him or he comes home in a body bag . Okay . Thank you . Thank you . You okay ? That was too close . I 'm the one who found you . After the explosion , I mean . You were lying so still . I ... I haven 't been that scared since the day we first came to Terra Nova and they pulled you aside at Hope Plaza . Jim , I was so sure I was never going to see you again . But you did see me again . 'Cause no matter how bad things get ... you can always count on me showing up ... right here every time . 'Cause I make it my mission in life to always find my way back to you . ♪ ( blow lands ) ( soldier grunts ) Not again . Evening patrol , three dead , four wounded . How many of theirs did we get ? None , sir . They saw us coming . Someone 's helping my father . Shannon , table four needs a refill . Another Shannon , huh ? You seem to be everywhere . ( chuckles ) Is there anything else I can get for you ? You look sad . You didn 't , um , you didn 't lose a friend in all this , did you ? Buck up , kid . Here 's a terra . Buy yourself a new friend . There she is ! My beautiful sister ! Join me . Do you mind ? Three 's a crowd . Hi . So , I asked you here ' cause I 'm curious about something ... our father . What did he say when he found out that you were spying for Mira in exchange for your mother 's life ? Did he forgive you ? Not that it 's any of your business , but he hasn 't said a word to me . I can imagine how much that must hurt you . Oh , he just needs time . Sooner or later I know we 'll talk . I wouldn 't be so sure . I 've been waiting my whole life for him to forgive me . Forgive you for what ? For being born , dear sister . For the , uh , unforgivable act of being born . ( scoffs , chuckles ) Please don 't do that . You are so beautiful . Okay . Please let go . Stop it ! Excuse me . ( gasps ) Come on ! Boylan : Take it easy , he 's just a kid ! - Hold him up . - Skye : No . SKYE : Lucas , Lucas , no , no ! DURWIN : So I think I 've figured out what 's up with all the activity around the perimeter fence . They 've installed some kind of new detection grid . So we 're gonna need a Phoenix access card to disable it . Mr. Shannon ! It 's Josh . ( soldiers jeering ) All right , all right ! Enough . I got to say ... I 'm a little hurt . I 've been nothing if not generous in my treatment of you people . You brought this on yourself . And now I 'm gonna have to make an example of you . ( men yelling ) ( weapon powers up ) Search him . I have to say , Sheriff , the limp , very convincing . My father would have been impressed . You , uh , did you have a good laugh about it the last time you saw him ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . No ? Transponder . So that 's how my father always knew when and where to hit us . Planting these on our vehicles , Shannon ? Clever . Where 's my father ? Where is he ? ! Maybe I can ... help you remember . Take him to the brig . Both of them . I 'm sorry . Don 't be . You did what everyone around here 's been wanting to do for days . ( sighs ) You take it way too easy on me . But I get it now . For the longest time , I was so mad at you for going off on that population control officer back in Chicago . Sometimes you can 't help yourself . ( door shuts ) You want the good news or the bad news first , Sheriff . Surprise me . The good news is , your son 's free to go . No , I 'm staying with him . Josh ? Believe me , I wanted to kill you , young Shannon , a lot . But , uh , I was , uh ... I was persuaded otherwise . Get him out of here . Dad ? - Dad ? Dad ! - Hey ! - Take it easy . - Dad ! - It 's okay , Josh . - Don 't , don 't touch him ! ( zapping ) Cool toy . Isn 't it ? Where 's my father ? ( grunting and panting ) I don 't know how you people can stand this place . Hold still . Bugs the size of dogs , plants that eat children . Why would anyone want to live in this nightmare ? What did you just give me ? Antihistamine for the itching . ELISABETH : I 'll take it from here . Thank you , Nurse . Hello . I 'm Dr. Shannon . You feeling any better ? No . If anything the itching just got worse . Have you ever heard of Trichomonas Sastrei ? It 's a parasite known to cause heart lesions in slashers . In humans , the larvae attack the central nervous system and sort of burrow their way into the brain stem . From what I understand , it 's ... quite an excruciating way to die . Why are you telling me this ? Because you 've just been injected with half a million Trichomonas larvae . I switched out your antihistamine . Lucas Taylor is detaining my husband , and you are gonna help me get him out in change for the cure . One of these is an antiparasitic . Other two are poisonous . And only I know which is which . And as soon as my husband is free , I will tell you . Do we have a deal ? ( zapping ) ( screaming ) ( whispers ) : We don 't have to keep doing this . Just tell me where my father is . What the hell did he do to make you hate him so much ? ( zapping ) ( groans ) What happened in Somalia ? He told you about that ? He said he couldn 't save your mother , That you blamed him for her death . He could have saved her , he chose not to . He let her die . He ... he watched her die . I don 't believe you . I was there ! I was there when the rebels took the city . When they lined the civilians up and told my father and his soldiers that they had to choose . Each soldier could save one person ... just one . They would have just executed me on the spot . But her ... her they ... they , uh ... took their time with . Lucas ... what happened ... was not his fault . They made him choose . You can 't blame him for that . No . He blamed me . I could see it in his eyes ... even at 14 ... and every time I disappointed him , and every time I didn 't live up to his expectations of what the great Nathaniel Taylor 's son was supposed to be . Lucas , you put this all on yourself . You , don 't patronize me . ( zapping ) ( screams ) Lucas , we located your father 's camp . An assault team 's getting ready to roll out . - I want to be here . - I figured you would . They 're leaving from the south gate . Keep him alive . Jim ! What did they do to you ? The cure ! Give it to me . ( panting ) : How long before it starts killing the parasites ? - Parasites ? What parasites ? - The ones you ... You were bluffing . You 're a highly-suggestible hypochondriac , Mr. Weaver . I suggest you see a doctor about that . Josh ! - Did you just give me ... - A sedative , yeah , I did . Josh ! Help me get your father out . We don 't have much time . Come on , girls . We 're getting out of here . - Mom ? - Yeah ? That was awesome . Skye managed to get a message to Taylor 's camp . They 're sending someone for us , but we have to make it to the tree line , okay ? With Josh 's help , I think I can make it . ( alarm blaring ) They 're looking for us . LUCAS : Shannon 's escaped , and Weaver 's gone missing . - You two , round it back . - Man : Yes , sir . ( indistinct voice on radio ) He 's alive . - Idiot . - All clear ! They 're gone . No one 's here . Wake this guy up . Let 's find these people . ( radio beeps ) ( indistinct radio announcement ) Wash . You made it . Dunham was right about the new perimeter grid . I disabled it with this controller . We got five minutes until they realize that this section is down . Where 'd you get your hands on that ? Swiped it off a very drunk guard at Boylan 's . He 's not gonna stay drunk forever . Once they trace that back to you , they 'll know you helped us escape . You gotta come with us . It 's 100 yards . You 'll never make it to the tree line unless someone distracts those guards . Wash ... the plan was for you to come with us . Jim ... there 's no other way . ( on radio ) : ... three and five secure . Repeat , towers three and five secure ... Go , and you save your family . Give Taylor a message for me , would you ? Remind him about Cu Lao Cham . Cu Lao Cham ? I don 't , I don 't know what that is . He 'll understand . Now ... you get ready to run like hell . - How will we know when ? - You 'll know . Thank you . Wash ...

You helped the Shannons escape . Where are they ? Tell me which way they went , and I might let you live . - TAYLOR : Load up . We gotta go . - Man : Yes , Sir . What happened to Wash ? She stayed behind , so we could get out . You have three seconds before I shoot . Taylor . No . It 's suicide . You can 't . One ... two ... You know , you have your father 's eyes . ( shot fires ) ♪ Is it true about Wash , Commander ? Afraid so . She was a good soldier . That she was . Get these folks settled , They 've had a long night . Is this where we 're going to live now , Daddy ? Just for a little while . Till the bad people go away , and then we 'll go home again , okay , sweetie ? Is Mark Reynolds around ? He 's on patrol duty . Okay . Ah , hell . Dunham . - Find Reynolds and take his shift . - Me ? Why ? Just do it , Private . Thanks . Well , you find anything out there in the Badlands ? We found something . Wait . We held up our end of the bargain . When are you going to hold up yours ? Don 't worry , you 'll be paid . I 'm talking about going back to 2149 . I want to see my daughter . As soon as the terminus is repaired , you and your people are free to go . ( animal screeching ) ( man speaks indistinctly over radio ) ZOE : Commander Taylor , sir ? Hey . Zoe Shannon . I 'm really sorry about what happened . Lieutenant Washington was a nice lady . She saved us . She did her duty right up to the end . She taught me how to make a fire . Well , did she now ? In survival training . What else did she teach you ? Which way 's north . And which way is it ? That way . She taught you good . Thanks . If you need another hug ... just ask . You okay ? Just thinking ... how many more people are going to die before this thing is over ? They 're bringing reinforcements . They 're going to bring back more men and more equipment , and they 're going to keep bringing them back , whatever it takes . We can 't give up hope , Jim . Okay ? 'Cause that 's what this place is about . It 's about hope and a second chance , and we cannot let them take that away from us . All right ? I 'm going to go talk to Taylor . Give him Wash 's message . Okay . I missed you so much . Me , too . ( animal howling ) Carnotaur . It 's okay . Perimeter 's mined . Besides , you can tell by the call it 's just a juvenile . Actually , they may be smaller , but juveniles are even more vicious . Kind of like hormonal teenagers with claws . Ooh . Dad ... Don 't mind me . I 'm just passing through . I got sentry duty . I-I should get back . Cu Lao Cham . Wash told you to remind me of Cu Lao Cham . I don 't know what it means . Our unit was pinned down on the island . We were outnumbered two-to-one . Only way on or off was a bridge to the mainland . So we blew the bridge , so they couldn 't bring any more troops across . So even though it was your only way out , you ... you trapped yourselves there . Well , we figured two-to-one was better than three-to-one , so what the hell , let 's make our stand . What happened ? I 'm still here , aren 't I ? ( chuckles ) The portal . That 's Cu Lao Cham bridge . As long as it 's open , they 'll keep bringing forces back till we 're overwhelmed and then they can start strip-mining , plundering this place for everything it 's worth . They 'll kill this world just as sure as they killed the world we left behind . Unless we blow the bridge . That 's what Wash was trying to tell us . Uh , wait now . Are you talking about taking out Hope Plaza ? That I am . Taylor , even if we could find a way to do it , we 'd be cutting ourselves off , too . That means no more meds , no more technology . No more colonists . A thousand people is all we 'd have to restart civilization . A thousand people ... that is a good round number . This is our home . If we have to cut ourselves off from that future in order to hold on to our home , then we 'll just have to survive out here with what we 've got . We 'll survive . But first , let 's kick some ass . Do you have any idea what a kilo of this stuff is worth in 2149 ? And we have three containers of it just sitting and gathering dust . Not for long . The terminus is fixed ? Malcolm Wallace just told me . That ore will be in our employer 's hands before nightfall . ( laughing ) They are going to be happy to hear that . In fact , I might just take a little trip to 2149 . Present it to them in person . Anything to get away from here , even for a couple hours . - Excuse me , sir . - Yeah ? To what do I owe the pleasure ? Well , I 've been thinking a lot about what you said the other day . Mm-hmm . If you 're right that your father 's never going to forgive me for what I did , then why bother ? If my loyalty means nothing to him , maybe I 'm being loyal to the wrong side . Why does it have to be you , Jim ? Because I know Hope Plaza better than anybody . Besides , I broke into that place once before , remember ? Yeah , but that was so you could be with your family . This could take you away from us forever . Elisabeth , you said it yourself ... if we don 't fight them , then everything we 've sacrificed for , the life we want for our kids , will be taken away from us . I 'm not going to let that happen . How 's it coming ? Good to go . Let me show you how to arm this thing . Okay . This one unlocks the triggering mechanism , and this one starts the timer . MAN : Incoming ! ( rifles cocking ) REILLY : It 's okay , boys . It 's one of ours . That is disturbingly convincing . We think so . TAYLOR : Reynolds , Dunham , gather up . Reilly , - you all set ? - Yes , sir . Good . Your team ... you set ? BOTH : Yes , sir . How about you , Commander ? Wasn 't easy , but we got the job done . We move out in five minutes . Jim . Right . All set here . Now remember , inject it as close to the heart as possible , okay ? You sure it 's enough ? This concentration ... it would kill three men instantly . Listen , I know you 're worried . - Tell the kids ... - Stop . Jim , don 't . Just ... Whatever you 're going to say can wait till you get back , okay ? 'Cause you will come back , won 't you , Jim ? Always . - All good ? - We 're all set to move out . - Whenever you 're ready . - Okay . Three 's a crowd . You heard the lady . Yes , sir . What ? What is it ? What if I told you I knew how to get in touch with your father ? Wait , what are you talking about ? You 're heading back to the colony ? Why ? ( static ) I got some new information about my father . - I 'm going to follow it up . - Say again . I 'm getting interference from the terminus . Something 's come up . I 'll explain later . Okay , what about the cargo you were bringing ? I 'll have someone else drive it out to you . Lucas out . So , you really ready to do this ? Lure my father into an ambush ? Yeah , I 'm ready . All right . Uh , for the ambush part anyway . Good to go . Good luck . All right . Get this thing back to camp . We need as many vehicles as we can get . Will do . And just how do you think you 're going to get this thing started ? You don 't know the code . You know , I 'd beat it out of you , but , uh , afraid you might like that , dear brother . Guess I 'll just jack the starter . All right , we 're ready . Is that the cargo from Lucas 's truck ? Here it is . REYNOLDS : Lucas said to tell you sorry if he held you up , but , uh , there was something important he had to do . Yeah , yeah , whatever . Hooper . Scan this into the manifest . Let 's get moving . ( electronic trilling ) ( beeping ) Hang on . Something 's not right here . ( electronic trilling ) ( chimes ) Never mind . We 're good . Let 's get this cargo moving , people . 2149 awaits . ( whooshing ) ( whooshing ) ( mechanical whirring ) ( groans ) My father 's going to destroy the fracture , isn 't he ? He 's going to cut this place off from 2149 . ( sighs ) And I was so close to beating him . Mmm . To taking it all away . Yeah . Well , you win some , you lose some . ( gasping ) And I like to win . ( grunts ) ( mechanical whirring ) ( clunking ) WEAVER : Right this way , gentlemen . I 'm happy to report the first shipment from Terra Nova has arrived . We now have a two-way pipeline to the most plentiful world mankind has ever known . ( engine struggling to start ) Hooper , you there ? This is Hooper . I 'm not reading you . The interference is too strong . Contact ... Plaza . ( garbled transmission continues ) Not copying you . Over . Hope Plaza is under attack . They need to power down and sever their link to the fracture . Otherwise , we could lose it for good . You have to tell them . Hooper ? ( static droning ) ( beeps , explosion booms ) - What did you do ? ! - What ? What 's happening ? ( sighs ) The induction coils are shorted . Your men must have damaged them when they moved it . Can you fix it ? ( blows ) Attaboy , Malcolm . With the fracture untethered , where will Jim appear when he gets back from Hope Plaza ? Well , he 's going to end up someplace else when he comes back through , but don 't worry ... it 'll be within three klicks of right here . I 'm going to need to go back to the colony and get replacements . Well , hurry up , then . ( pulsating whooshing ) WEAVER : Meteoric iron , gentlemen . Back there , you can 't spit without hitting the stuff . We brought back three containers . Each one holds 30 metric tons . ( chuckles ) Gentlemen , today you 're rich . Tomorrow ... well , it 's just going to be stupid . MAN : What about the other matter we asked you to look into ? The Badlands . Yeah , we sent some people out that way . MAN : And ? Did you find anything ? As a matter of fact , we did . ( electronic trilling ) ( low growling ) Why don 't you see for yourselves ? ( growling ) ( roaring ) ( roars ) ( crunching , squishing ) ( panting ) Is it coming this way ? What do we do ? It 's all clear . Go . ( Carnotaur roaring ) ( man screaming ) ( shrieking ) We got a problem ... a big problem ! ( footsteps approaching ) You there , stop ! ( panting ) ( radio beeps ) SKYE : Commander Taylor , come in . It 's Taylor . Go ahead , Skye . It 's Lucas , sir ... he got away . Where is he now ? My guess is he 's headed your way , towards the terminus . He 's on foot . Copy that . I 'm on it . Out . Hello , son . Where you heading in such a hurry ? I think we both know the answer to that . ( groaning ) You drew blood . Didn 't think you had it in you . Think again . ( grunting ) ( beeping ) ( whirring ) ( rapid beeping ) ( explosions booming ) ( whooshing ) ( panting ) For the first time , I 'm glad your mother is dead . Don 't . She would be so ... ashamed of what you 've become . Don 't say that . It 's true , boy . You know it 's true . It wasn 't my fault she died . ( crying ) : It 's not my fault she ... Your fault she ... ? Of course it wasn 't . My God , is that what you think ? Help me ... Just ... forgive me . Please . It 's not that simple . Look , you 've got to answer for what you 've done . We all do . Oh , Dad ... I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry . ( sobbing ) I know . You 're still my son . You 're still my b ... ( thud ) ( groaning ) You arrogant fool . Do you think I care about your forgiveness ? It 's you who should be begging me for mine ! ( shot fires ) ( shot fires ) ( gasps ) Oh , God ! Uh , don 't move . It 's bad . Lucas . I 'm sorry . ( alarm blaring ) Uh-uh-uh . What the hell did you do ? Weaver ... You stupid son of a bitch . Do you have any idea what you 've cost us ? ! ( gun hammer cocks ) ( hissing ) ( screams ) ( growling ) ( roaring ) ( creature roaring in distance ) You think you can get to your feet ? All right , here . ( grunting ) SKYE : Oh , my God , he 's gone . ( over radio ) : Still no sign of him . A fracture reopened near here . ( indistinct radio transmission ) It 's gotta be close . Oh , come on , Jim . Elisabeth . ( sobbing ) I told you I 'd be back . What happened ? Hope Plaza ... it 's gone . They blew it to pieces . What are you talking about ? We 're stuck here ... forever . ( creature squawks in distance ) ( insects chirring ) Maybe it 's just me , but knowing we 're cut off from the future makes this jungle seem a whole lot bigger somehow . Excuse me , Commander . Dunham . Just got a transmission from the colony . It 's Boylan . Boylan ? Boylan , this is Taylor . Hello , Commander . Good to hear your voice again . You 're taking a hell of a risk , aren 't you ? Contacting me on an unsecured frequency ? There 's no one listening . In fact , there 's no one here . All those big-spending new customers of mine ? They 're all gone . What 's that , now ? Phoenix picked up their operation and rolled out 15 minutes ago . The whole lot of ' em . Hey , thanks for the heads up . We 'll be waiting . Oh , no , not to worry . They 're not coming your way . They 're headed north . North ? Don 't ask me why . All I know is I 've got an empty bar that needs filling . So hurry home , would ya ? ( applause and cheering ) ( cheering ) ♪ It 's good to see you up here ... where you belong . It 's good to be home . Those bastards left a lot of scars . JIM : Yeah . Nothing we can 't fix . Shannon , that was a hell of a thing you pulled off back in Hope Plaza . Makes me kinda glad I didn 't run your ass out the gates the day you broke into my colony . ( chuckles ) - Commander . - Reynolds . One of our RBs on the northern perimeter just spotted the Phoenix convoy . A dozen vehicles , at least a hundred men . Which way they heading ? We lost track of them . After they passed marker 33 . Looked like they were heading toward the Badlands . Badlands ? Why the hell would they go there ? There 's nothing out there . Wish I could tell you , sir . Badlands . Weaver shipped something he found out there back to Hope Plaza . At least he was going to , anyway , if we hadn 't switched out the containers . I overheard them talking about it . Did he say what it was ? Not before he got a face full of Carno . Let 's track down that container . Let 's get it out of there , see what it is . What is it ? It looks like a statue . It 's not a statue . It 's the prow of a ship . It 's old . 18th century , from the looks of it . How the hell did a ship from any century end up in the Badlands ? How did it even end up in this time period ? Well , it didn 't come through Hope Plaza , that 's for sure . However it got here , it kinda makes you wonder what else is out in the Badlands waiting for us ? What bothers me is why Phoenix headed out there the minute they realized they were cut off from 2149 . JIM : Taylor wants to keep this under wraps until we know more . And I think that 's the right way to go . That 's fine by me . To be honest with you , I don 't even want to think about what it all might mean right now . I 'm just really glad we 're safe . - Me , too . - Yeah . JIM : What are they looking at ? Hey , what are you looking at ? Maddy claims there 's a meteor shower tonight . Nothing so far , though . Maybe I got my calculations wrong . Zoe , do you want to go inside and help me run them again ? The kid 's been through enough . Wait . One 's coming . I know it . Okay ... Told you ! Oh , you called it , Zoe .

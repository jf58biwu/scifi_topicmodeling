 Good news , everyone . Remember when you asked to see my family tree ? No . Ta-da ! This is my ancestor , Philo Farnsworth , inventor of television , and as a bonus , childhood obesity . And here 's Dean Farnsworth , developer of the Farnsworth Test for Colorblindness . Where is he , blast it ? And just recently , I learned of a modern-day Farnsworth who invented the Anti-Senility Truss . That 's you , Professor . Wha ... Ah , yes , the Farnsworths boast a proud and distinguished lineage . No wormy fruit on this tree . What about Fry ? Isn 't he your distant uncle ? Very distant . Not a true Farnsworth , mind you . He 's way over here on this filthy branch riddled with fungus and dung beetles . What 's with the 17 dung beetles ? Ugh ! Well , it 's 6 : 00 . I guess we 'll have to deliver that human heart tomorrow . Good work , people . Woo-hoo ! Time to go clubbing ! Baby seals , here I come . Guess I better head over to my night job . You have a night job ? Yup . It 's exhausting , but I need the extra money to buy coffee so I can stay awake for my night job . But ... Got to go ! Ah ! You 've got a surprising amount of algae in your beard , Mr. President . Just sit still and let the algae-eater do its work . Lay off my trademark mole ! Hi , Lars . Fry . Whatever . I 'm heading out to my night job . Remember , no loud noise , no head bowling , and no parties , or it 'll be your ass in a jar . I want to go to that museum ! Man , this place is a snooze . Hey , Fry , I challenge President Taft here to a pie-eating contest . You 're on , skinny . Sorry , guys . You know the rules . No fun allowed . Come on , you pansy ! I 'm thirsty ! I want me some Tennessee loopy juice ! And I want loose women ! The kind that aren 't afraid to show a little ankle . Or elbow . No visitors . I 'll lose my job . Oh , boohoo . " I 'll lose my minimum wage job . " You 're mean , Rutherford B. Hayes ! Listen here , young man . We have nothing to fear but running out of beer . All right , one small get-together , but let 's keep it quiet and dignified . Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah ! All right ! Four more beers ! Four more beers ! Yes ! Right in the lke ! Nice elbow action . So , you grow hemp . Yes . And you do what with it ? All manner of things . Manufacture paper , fabric , rope ... Oh . Well , nice talking to you . Why , I used to smoke about four feet of rope a day . Let me give you my pager number . Hey , Reagan , remember when you asked to see my family tree ? I asked you to leave me alone . The Farnsworths are a remarkable ... Farnsworth ? That name is a stain on American history . One of the worst traitors of the Revolution was a Farnsworth . You 're lying ! He 's George Washington . He tends not to do that . David Farnsworth was a notorious British agent and counterfeiter . He conspired to bring down our nation with his fraudulent currency ! A Farnsworth did this ? Oh , dear ! My good name is ruined ! Hi . I 'm Jerry . I like movies . Anyone seen Ulysses Grant ? He owes me a cheroot . He 's over there , puking in the bushes . No ! Oh , boy . Mr. Fry ! Why are all these people standing around when they should be partying ? All right ! Hey , hey , LB J , you want to get drunk ? Hell , yeah . Zoidberg , no ! The effects of jar juice aren 't fully understood . Uh ... Not bad . A hint of Vitalis and ... Whoa ! I recognize this . It 's the 1960s ! I did a report on it for my drug-taking class . Hi , I 'm Andy Warhol , and you 're some kind of marvelous lobster-man . Right on . Say , you got any real soup , or just this schlock ? What a horrid bore . Ooh . Huh ? Far out . That head gave me a total head trip ! Really ? I 'm gonna lick Herbert Hoover 's head . Lick the head ! Lick the head ! Whoa ! A speakeasy ! One prohibited beverage , please . Hey , Dutch , the new still is here ! I 'm not a still . I just smell like one . Dutch Schultz , come out with your bootleg whiskey . We 're thirsty ! What the heck is going on ? Jefferson , did you sell me some bad rope ? Lt must have something to do with the jar fluid . A - ha ! Dr. Cahill , do I detect a trace of opalescence ? Very observant , Professor . To preserve the heads , we use a rare form of powdered crystalline opal . This is the world 's entire supply . Yet it 's so powerful , it should last a thousand years . It keeps the heads alive , but we don 't know how . Why did it give us those hallucinations ? Because it didn 't ! Yeah-uh . Opal has unusual temporal properties . It preserves each head in a time stasis bubble . Ergo , licking those heads actually sent us back in time to their original eras . Look ! Schlock and more schlock . Psst . Is the coast clear ? Button your yap , you mug . I 've discovered a new means of time travel . I 'll call it the Farnsworth Effect ! Nice try , but even this discovery won 't undo the treachery wrought by your nefarious ancestor , David Farnsworth . It will if we go back in time and stop him ! Professor , no ! You can 't tongue the father of our country ! Where are we ? Also , when are we ? 68th and Broadway , Colonial era . Rush hour . By my calculations , this head trip will last at most 24 hours . We need to stop that monster , David Farnsworth ! Look at the date on this newspaper . April 17th , 1775 . Say , on this exact date , the Continental Congress was meeting secretly in New York . Maybe they can help us . But they could be meeting anywhere . What are we going to do , search building to building ? We 'll start with that one . Alexander Hamilton of New York , how say you ? Nay . John Hancock and John Adams of Massachusetts ? Yea ! Yea ! The yeas have it . Our nation 's official joke state shall be New Jersey . Uh-oh ! Ah , it is just our new Crock-Pot . Watch it , wiggy . I ain 't no stinking crock . We 'll see about that in five hours . Halt ! From whence comest thou , one-eyed maiden ? Uh ... Ever been to Peru ? Certainly not . I 'm from Peru . Clam up , Founding Fathers . We need help locating the treacherous forger who forged this forgery . My word . If these enter circulation , our economy will be destroyed , and with it , our chance at independence . Only one man in the colonies has a printing press fine enough to make these . Our good friend , Ben Franklin ! Uh-oh . Isn 't Franklin in Philadelphia ? When he 's not in Charlotte or Marybelle or Louisa . I don 't get it . I 'm sure no one 's ever said this before , but I must get to Philadelphia as quickly as possible ! Oh . Why couldn 't my disgraced ancestor have lived in the NASCAR era ? Dr. Franklin , your new steam engine is here . I ain 't no stinking steam engine ! Chicken 's ready . You may go , Louisa . Now I get it . Fascinating . Be you man or machine ? Mostly machine . Might be a couple of dead cats in there . Dr. Franklin , with all due respect to the brilliant inventor of the stove , I must speak with you . I 'm looking for the scoundrel who made this . Intricate filigree , satanic symbols . Looks like one of mine . But no , this is a fake ! Duh . It says , " Colony of Maffachufetts . " More like Taxachufetts . That 's just how we print " S " s , you ftupid fhitheads . Someone must have used my press while I was poking around in Charlotte . Let 's ask my apprentice , David Farnsworth . Farnsworth ? That 's him ! Arm yourselves ! I call it the Franklinator . The apprentice 's suite is empty ! He 's gone ! Wait . What 's that glistening in the chamber pot ? Let 's find out ! Bender , do you know what a chamber pot is ? I don 't know , and I don 't care . A Massachusetts ha 'penny ? Probably fake , too . There 's one way to find out . Ew . What ? Bender bit a poo penny . Bender bit a poo penny . Look , ' tis but worthless tin . Where could Farnsworth have minted such a high quality fake ? Not here . But you know , I have a friend in Boston who 's an expert silversmith . They could be connected . There 's only , like , 40 people who do anything around here . But Boston 's 300 miles away , and Bender kicked our horse to death . We 'll never get there in time . Unless you have another invention up your sleeve . Hmm ... How is this going to get us to Boston ? Stupid Franklin . I will get you ! Ah . That scrap metal I ordered is here . I 'm 40 % scrap metal . Well , Ben Franklin , my fellow son of liber-tea kettles . Yes , I 've made some new teakettles . Perfect for special occasions . Like hanging King George in effigy ... And " H " and " l " are monograms you can put on those kettles . What are you looking at , you British bastards ? Paul , we talked about this . Mr. Revere , we 're looking for a counterfeiter who minted these smelly ha 'pennies . His name is David Farnsworth . Farnsworth ? I just hired him for the fall candlestick rush . He 's in the foundry this very moment . Everybody , take a Franklinator . Aw , I got a chipmunk . Hee-ya ! Uh , wha ? David Farnsworth , I presume ? I is Davy Farnsworth . Foof . You 're a disgrace to the very name , Farnsworth . Look out ! He 's got a bezelling planisher . That 's right . Who wants to be bevelled ? You idiot . I 'm not a cannon . Huh . I guess I am a cannon . Time to prune the family tree . Wha ! Huzzah ! I 've saved the Farnsworth name . Urgent message for Mr. Revere . " Mr. Revere , pray do not fhit your pants . " The British attack has begun . " Cross the river and watch for my signal . " I must ride . He has so much stuff . He won 't miss this . Let 's burn these counterfeits and paddle the next swan boat the hell out of Boston . Here you go . Thanks . Say , where did you get that lantern ? From that old church to the north . They had two burning , so I figured they wouldn 't miss one . " One if by land , two if by sea . " The British are coming ! The British are coming ! By land . By land . Gotta treat this OCD . Gotta treat this OCD . Fry , you dope . You 've really screwed the granny this time . History needed that second lantern . We 'd better stop Paul Revere before ... I guess everything worked out jolly all right , eh , guvnor ? What 's with the fruity accent , ducky ? Bollocks , I got it , too . Where 's all the Presidents heads , then ? I say . Appears we 've changed history too much . Disaster of nightmarish proportions and what not . Quite . Where have you blokes been ? You nearly missed elevenses . Who 's for tea and shmavouries ? What in bloody hell 's going on around here , I says . Indeed . What 's become of the dear old USA ? Beg pardon ? The Revolution ? 1776 and what all ? Oh ! The Colonial dustup . Well , there 's nothing we Brits enjoy more than a good documentary . Turn on the tellyvisor , Dr. Zoidsmythe . I 'll dial up the Beeb . They 've always got a nice docky-wocky on . The Vanquished Pride of the Yankees , or , America the Dutiful . North America , or West Britannia as we now call it , has been under British rule for 1,400 years , all thanks to a nutter known as Wrong-Way Revere . The British are coming by land , by land . But we came by sea , we did . Surprised the Yanks at Lexington , ending the rebellion with nary a kipper scuffed . Scuffed kippers , anyone ? Right kind of you , mum . The humiliated conspirators were forced to sign the Declaration of Dependence , proclaiming British rule forever . Meanwhile , a loyal Brit by the name of David Farnsworth , tracked down the traitor , George Washington , and bravely smothered him with his wig . Oh , criminy . In gratitude , King George named Farnsworth a duke and granted his family massive landholdings in the colonies . Blimey . I 've never felt so ashamed to be a Farnsworth . Will my lord be returning to his massive landholdings for luncheon ? Huh , wha ? I know we 're ladies in waiting , but what are we waiting for ? How should I know ? Just shut up and wait . Say , how is it that we 've got socialized medicine , but me teeth still look like this ? Can 't we just go back in time , and set things right again ? Don 't want to . Rather nice , living under the Crown and so forth . Rather . What 's more , couldn 't go back even if we wanted to . No more crystalline opal left in all the world , don 't you know ? My lord , the Queen is here for her weekly visit . The Queen ? Sounds most satisfactory . All of you , out ! Right then . Let 's go play some quoits , whatever that is . Presenting the Queen of England , America , and two parking spaces in Tokyo . Where 's me consort at ? Consort ? That 's right , love . For centuries , the Farnsworth gentlemen has provided service to the Queen . Now , close your eyes and think of England . I say . What 's that in your crown ? You mean the Andamooka Opal ? That 's the most precious gem in all the ... Yes . Three rubbers on the hobb . Stop him ! He crowned me in the knickers and nicked me crown . Freeze . Or we 'll be forced to continue chasing you , since we don 't carry guns . Indubitably . We 've got to go back in time and set things straight ! Hurry up and lick Washington 's head again ! We can 't . There 's no George Washington nor any other presidents . What about this bloke ? He 's from Revolutionary times . Farnsworth . Hey , you 're the plonkers what candlesticked me . Well , I showed you . I killed George Washington , and now I 'm married to one of the Spice Girls . Don 't rightly know which one . Bender , fetch me that powdered opal . It 's time to restore dignity to the Farnsworth name . Ew ! There . That time I left both lanterns in place . And I hit Farnsworth much , much harder . Perhaps too hard . Look , all the presidents are back . Even John Tyler . That 's the first time anyone 's spoken to me in 1,200 years . Yes , from Chester A. Arthur to Chester Z. Arthur , they 're all here . Our republic and the Farnsworth family name are saved . And no one will ever know . Yeah . English - US - PSDH

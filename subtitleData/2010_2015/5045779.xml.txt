 Previously on Continuum ... Do you think I 'm pretty ? Someone removed Elena 's body . I have some very good skills for a guy in your line of work . Do you think we could start working on the schematics first thing ? Where 's Alec Sadler ? You hear about Jowarski and Chen ? Someone claiming to be Section Six just took two bodies from the morgue . You and me , working together ... What 've we got to lose ? Number four . You . Come with me . Heavy security tonight . The CPS escort , I mean . Hand over the metal . You like ? - We can make this fast and easy . - I doubt that . He 's a very old man . Come back in an hour . You look very pretty , Jasmine . 2077 . My time . My city . My family . When terrorists killed thousands of innocents , they were condemned to die . They had other plans . The time travel portal sent us all back 65 years . I want to get home , but I can 't be sure what I will return to if history is changed . Their plan ? To corrupt and control the present in order to win the future . What they didn 't plan on , is me . S02 Ep08 = Second Listen = - Drop it ! - Hands up where I can see ' em ! - Get out ! - Get out of my car ! [ Dog barking ] [ dog barking ] Is Brandy gonna be ok ? I would be more worried about your situation . You two braniacs rented a van that was used in commission of a crime . Used by a Mr. Miller and Mr. Warren ? Never heard of ' em . Oh , you 've never heard of the corpses that they lifted from the morgue ? No ? Jowarski and Chen ? We also found your prints on a casket that was dug up recently . Grave robbing is a major felony , and you add that to the drug charge ? You guys are going back to prison for some very serious time . We weren 't robbing it . We were just going to move ... Shut the hell up , Bicksor , I swear ! You were saying ? Shouldn 't I talk to a lawyer or something ? Yeah , if we were cops you should probably talk to a lawyer , yeah . But he 's a loose cannon , and the woman in the coffin was a friend of mine . That means she 's taking it very personally . That ? That was just me warming up . Dig up the body , transport it , the money was there waiting for us . That 's all I know . Transport it where ? There . Check the cab . - Clear ! - Same here . I 'll get my people to work . I 'll track down the owners . See if there 's a paper trail . Security footage . I 'll get my people on it as well . You want some help with that ? You want this to work , or you wanna break up now ? Is this your idea of pranking in the future ? No . In basic , we did reboot a cadet 's CMR while he was sleeping and he practically ricocheted out of his body . - Hilarious . - I know . But , he was alive . You 're asking me to remotely trigger the com channel of a dead person and use their CMR to look through their dead eyes ? Technically , it 's possible . Then , once we connect ... It 's weird and it 's creepy , and I feel like I 'm reanimating the dead . Actually , that 's kinda cool ! Alright , um , I 'm just going to use the same protocol from when we reactivated Elena 's CMR ... - And killed her . - And DIDN 'T kill her . And look , I 've already found it . Man , it 's still ticking . When future me invents a thing , I really invent a thing . - No GPS coordinates . - Yeah , it 's weird . We can still look around . Alright , cue the Gorimator . Who is that ? Alright , try the next node . Hmm mmm . There ! That 's it ! Power 's pooling up ! [ Crackling ] That 's not good ! Is your computer ok ? Yeah , they 're on isolated circuits . Man , that power surge must have been like half a kilowatt ! Can you imagine the potential ? - If we had all the sections ? - Yes , Yes ! Imagine the ... the money ... Draining out of my bank account as we speak ! What is he still doing here ? I thought we discussed this . I bring a world of experience and day-olds . - He 's actually really helpful . - At what ? Fishing refundable bottles out of dumpsters ? You 're supposed to be working on the arc project , not time travel . If we can harness a processing core , that 's like accessing the biggest , fastest computer known to man ! I think you 're underestimating it 's potential . Really ? Because all I see is a worn out piece of junk from the future with no potential . - I 'm gonna go now . - Good idea ! Why don 't you ? You know the way out . Look , I 'll talk to you later , this will all blow over . - Give him a break . - No , I get it , I get it . I understand . Time travel , right ? Exhilarating ! Heroic , even . Guys like you don 't get that chance very often . - Guys like me ? - Brainiacs . You know , geniuses . You park yourself behind the computer , and you change the world keystroke by keystroke . But no one understands that heroism . Naturally , you wanna dream a little larger . And Alec , believe me . You will . I mean , I am living proof . But , pardon the pun , there 's time for that . Arc is now . You said so yourself , it 's gonna create a new matrix in protecting our privacy , our security ... How we engage the world , how we communicate with one another ... - It 's going to change the world ! - And Alec , you 're going to change it . Yeah , and you 're going to sell it . The master key to the internet . Oh , we keep the key . We sell the services . Cracking encryptions , overwriting computer systems , information control . Yeah . And then I become death . The destroyer of all worlds . Oppenheimer was making a nuclear bomb . - It 's a different bottle , same genie . - I know you see the good in this , Alec . And I see the good in you ! So come on , what do you say ? Let 's make some billions , improve some lives , a little heroism on the side . Have you gotten a tetanus shot lately ? I 'm banking on immunity . I could eat this off the floor of your lab . Ever thought of moving there ? Not until this moment . There 's a lot more privacy , and there 's that little room upstairs ... you ok ? Yeah . Just ... this , right now , with you ... it 's the best moment I 've had in weeks . Kellog 's interference at the lab , and this whole mess with Julian and my mom ... I thought your mom forgave you ? Yeah , she 's been weird ever since the trial . I mean let 's face it , I turned her testimony into perjury . She did that . You told the truth . What else could you do ? - Yeah , it just makes me wonder . - What ? She just lied so easily on the stand , maybe she 's lied about other things . - Such as ... ? - I don 't know ... my dad ? Maybe he didn 't die in that fire . Maybe my mom lied and he 's been alive this whole time . - That 's a hell of a leap . - Yeah , I know . This is another one of our body snatchers ? Where 'd you get this image ? Uh , Section Six had a similar case ... - I dug it out of the file . - When was that ? No name , no history , just ... a picture . My people are working on it . You present a suspect with no explanation , and I 'm just supposed to take your word for it ? Yes , that 's how this has to work . Ok , so let me clarify here . Just because you and I appear to share a common goal doesn 't give you a get out of jail free card . Aw , I don 't need that card already , do I ? Maybe our grave robbers can I.D. him . They 've been shipped off to court for their arraignment . Looks like we 're going out on a field trip . - Should I be jealous ? - What ? Of course not . We 're just ... enjoying a temporary detente . Mutual interests . - Keep your friends close ... - And your enemies in a vice-like grip . Yeah , but who 's gripping who ? A few weeks ago , I tried Flash . I wanted to try to remember my dad and I think I did ! I had this memory from when I was little ... it was me , my mom , and Jason . Yeah . He just shows up in my life , he knows about my work , he knows about my father 's legacy ... ? - He 's batshit crazy ? - Yeah , he 's a little off the bean , but sometimes he 's so on , it 's a little scary ! What if Jason 's my ... It 's easy enough to gather the proof . A little DNA . Hair , saliva ... Yeah . Do it . Find out . It 'll get you some peace . - Didn 't you just give him a piece ? - You are so out of line ! You 're so right , and you 're just jealous . Honestly , I don 't know what you see in the guy . He 's got many talents . Well , you 've lead a very sheltered life . [ Phone vibrating ] Alec Sadler 's phone , how may I direct your call ? Hi , it 's Kiera ... is he there ? Oh , hello Kiera ! Yes , let me see if he 's available . One moment , please . - Hey , Kiera , what 's up ? - Is she in the lab ? ! No , we 're at my place if you must know . I 'm in his pants , not in his lab ! You need to protect yourself , and everything that you 're doing . How long has Kiera the cop been the bane of his existence , anyhow ? She showed up when he did . You and Kellog should start a band , you 're singing the same song . - I hate to agree with Kellog , but ... - Then don 't . Kellog doesn 't know what he 's talking about , with my work or with Emily . If he 's pressuring you on something , don 't blindly comply . Kellog wants what 's best for Kellog . - And how is that different from you ? - You 're right . I do have an agenda . - But Alec , I 'm here for you . - Right . - Which currently translates as ... ? - Mystery men , the body snatchers ? Yeah , I think I can work with the sound from when we zombie-hacked Elena , build up a sonographic portrait , an ultrasound of the location . That sounds great ! Hear how I did that ? Goodbye , Kiera . Hey , making bail doesn 't mean you 're out of the woods . Hey ! That 's the one that violated my civil rights , right there ! - Don 't make a scene . - That 's good advice . No body 's been recovered , this case is getting tossed . Oh , is that a fact ? My clients were walking through a cemetery , There 's no criminality in that ! Oh , shit ! Whoa ! Get some uniforms in here right now . Somebody call an ambulance ! Stay back ! Stay back ! Cameron ! I 've never seen anything like this before . Ok , then speculate . There are no puncture wounds . There are no wounds of any kind . I need to do an autopsy to determine whether poison was involved , but the visible trauma suggests an aneurism . Aneurisms . Or maybe not . I 'll ... Both at the same time . Right before testifying . Could be an extremely low frequency . A concealed weaponized ELF destructor ? No , I don 't think so . What , too sci-fi for you ? I can think of something more sci-fi than that . There . Camera three . See that guy right there ? Can you back it up ? Freeze . There . Zoom in . That 's him ! That 's the guy from the morgue . I 'll show you what I 've done so far ! It 's actually an idea of my father 's . You know , I 've never really uh ... I wanna work on the time travel , I mean that 's what I know ... Yeah , sure . It 's how you got back here , same explosion that brought back the others , except you landed in 1992 which is two years before I was born ... Do you remember anything from then ? Just after you arrived , people you may have met ? No ... well , I told you before ... there was a lot of confusion , a lot of gaps ... You really like this work , huh ? Yeah , it has potential . Kiera I can assure you , he doesn 't work for me . Now I 'm sure you 've got the tech that 'll tell you exactly where I stand on this . And I 'm sure you know something about this man , or who he works for . Unfortunately , I can 't help you with specifics . But you 're quite right , he and his associates are dangerous . Both to you , and to me . - Because you 're a time traveller . - Time traveller ? You have no personal items in this office . No diploma 's in frames , no golf trophies , no family photos . - I 've never been nostalgic . - I suppose it comes with the territory . Are you here to analyze me ? You reached out to me , remember ? Said we had a common interest ? I guess that was an empty gesture . They have tattoos . On their hands , it 's ... it 's subtle . It 's a series of dots between their fingers . - Does that help ? - Who are they ? You call them freelancers , but they have no formal identity . That would imply they exist . They 're more of a cult , and the time continuum is their chess board , and people like us are a liability because we understand what 's at stake . - What do they want ? - What everyone wants . Power . Control . - I don 't want that . - Are you sure ? After your call I checked our files for anyone with the marks you described , and I missed this John Doe . To be fair , the broken neck got most of my attention . - What 's his story ? - Found in an east side dumpster , broken arm , broken neck , bruising ... he was in the fight of his life . - Lost . - No I.D. ? - No grieving relative , girlfriend ... ? - No , not to date . I mean , you can understand how they 'd be missed . Seemingly random , look like birthmarks . Freckles , maybe ? They were supposed to be missed . They look like tattoos . Better than that . I put them under a microscope , check this out , you 're not going to believe it . Some kind of code . Okay , this tattoo pattern has shown up before . Last November , Emery Wallace , 83 years old , dies in a retirement home . Insurance company requires an autopsy , they note the pattern on his right hand . Same three fingers . Ten years ago Tommy Oliver , apparent suicide , same markings . - Any other connections ? - Well , not at first glance , but Oliver and Wallace aren 't exactly who they seemed . You see , they both died . Twice . Once the time Betty just mentioned , and decades earlier as infants . False identities . Re-used the paperwork of dead infants . And all men used the same legal firm to probate their wills . A tiny company called Fisker and Associates . Good work . I 'm going to need copies of all these files , please . That 'll take five minutes . What do you think ? I think that we 're on to something , I 'm not exactly sure what it is yet . What do you say we take a trip to Fisker and Associates ? You go ahead , I 've got ... Things that you 've gotta do . With your people . Section Six . Nevermind , I got this . Oh , I remember what it 's like to be that guy . I actually feel kinda sorry for him . He 's got a project , and it keeps him away from the more important truths . How long until it 's operational ? You can 't write code like this overnight ! What I 'm trying to create is essentially sentient . And your little orange slice makes it possible . Yeah , I 'm not sure how long it keeps Arc in the forefront , but I guess in your world we only have to be first , not the best . We can be the best , I 'm sure of it . So uh , more segments , more better ? More segments , more power so ... Yeah . I guess , more better . Except that absolute power corrupts absolutely , you know that whole caveat . - I have no idea what you mean . - Look . What I can do with this , right now , it 's a lot . And ... are you satisfied with that ? [ Phone vibrating ] With ... a lot ? Hello ? Alec man , we set off some serious trip wires here . - Could really use your help . - Are you serious ? You remember NASA ? This is worse . I can remote you ? Dude , I got three guys throwing smoke screens over here , ok ? Plus , do you want to compromise your server ? Mirror ? Come on , man . I need you . - Alright . I 've got to ... - Step out ? Yeah , me too . There 's great things coming our way , Alec . I can feel it . Mr. Fisker will be back shortly , are you sure this can 't wait ? This is official government business , ma 'am . I don 't have time to wait . Mr. Emery Wallace . - Very good . - Oh , Mr. Tommy Oliver . Do you have any information about their beneficiaries ? - Mr. Warren , of course ! - Of course ? We come across his name quite often . - As a beneficiary , I mean ! - Yeah , I see . Is this him ? Mmm mm . Do you um ... have an address ? - He usually drops by . - I see . Thanks . - You can 't take those ! - I just did ! Excuse me ! Who was that ? Alec ? Alec ? - Hey ! - So , you 're not in the lab ? I 'm an autonomous human being , you know , I have independent functionality ? - Yes , Hal . - Hey ! Is that your first pop culture reference ? I think it is ! Well , the first one you 'd get , anyway . You 'll have to wait , Dave , I have a few more databanks to wipe before I can take care of you . Listen , I know you 're really busy saving the world but when you get some free time I could really use your help tracking down these body snatchers . Will it make the world a better place ? Definitely . Well , then consider it done . - Thanks , Alec . - Hey , Kiera ? - I was thinking you and Emily ... - What ? I don 't know , I just think you guys should be friends . - We 're friends . - Just ... think about it , ok ? I gotta go . Dude ! Do you still think I 'm pretty ? - He 's not here . - Then where is he ? We 'll find him . - Garza 's been here . - How do ... Nevermind . I 'll put out an APB . Alec , please be there . Alec ! Let me in ! Move ! I 'll be right back . Let me in ! My boyfriend lives here , let me in ! I have to get in there ! Kiera ! What 's going on ? Where 's Alec ? - Was he here ? - We were . Well , he 's not here now . - What do you know ? - What do you know ? Hold her . Alec , Alec please be there . Alec ? Hello ? - Kiera ? - Jason ? - Is Alec there ? - Are you ? Jason , listen . This is very important . I need you to look around , I need you to look everywhere . I need you to tell me if Alec is there . Alec ? He 's not here . Alec ? Kiera , I looked everywhere , I can 't find him anywhere , even looked under the couch in case he was hiding . Ok , well Alec will send up a flare , we just have to figure out where to look , that 's all . Well , I don 't really know if I know what to look for . Just look for everything ! Alec 's life is at stake ! Okay . - Don 't like what you asked for ? - What are you talking about ? ! - So , what 've you been up to ? - Are you serious ? I 'm interested . People go to a coffee shop to talk about what they 're doing ! They don 't show up and kill your friends ! - Your friends tried to run . - You should have let them , Jesus Christ ! That 's done , you 're here now . Answer . Answer ? Answer . Ok , what I 've been up to , in case it 's of interest to Liber8 ? Don 't try to guess , we 're talking . That 's it . Listen to this , three dead bodies , they 're all on the Fisker payroll . I think we need to pay them another visit . Rattle his cage . Set up some surveillance . - I can 't join you . - And why not ? - Something 's come up . - Cameron ? Jason , I 'm back . Look , I need you to monitor police calls , utilities , traffic patterns , internet spikes , power disruptions ... Ok , ok ! Cell phone service , anything ! All of it ! Alec will find a way . - Anything ? - Not yet . - Don 't worry , he 's resourceful . - We 're not going to find him here . Stay on the radar . Is he at the lab ? Have you heard anything ? What aren 't you telling me ? If it had anything to do with where he could be , I 'd tell you . I 'll keep you posted . I can help . Right now I 'm working on a super computer , processing power orders of magnitude faster than anything today . - What do you do with it ? - Anything you want ! - Weapons , surveillance ... ? - Yeah , I guess you could . But I 've been exploring how it can speed up predictive modeling . - Especially in medicine . - Oh , how charitable of you . I had an aunt who died of cancer when she was 27 . So yeah , I want to create a system that can mine genome data sets like a Lego set for kids . - Guilty . - We 'll see . - What 're you doing ? - I 'm not here to talk about me . Talk ? A talk is a conversation ! I 'm not so good at monologues . Come on , you 're Liber8 , you guys have some interesting ideas when you 're not murdering people ! I 'm serious . I can listen . - You 're not listening . - I am ! That 's where you and I are alike , Jasmine . I 've seen you , listening . Watching . Figuring out how people work . When you see me , for instance , do you ... - Old , weak , slow . - Go on ? Patronizing , curious , sensual . I see you 're warming up to me . The way you touch your things . Like they 're precious . It 's not the things that are precious , it 's the idea behind them . What they can do . I saw what you and your advances did in the future . Put every human being on a leash , jerked it when you didn 't like the behaviour . Destroyed them if they became inconvenient . There are safeguards , proprietary safeguards that I 'll put in place ! Things don 't have to turn out the way you think ! Talk . Words . Come back in ten years and see how I 'm doing ! Jason ! I 've got it all up here , scanners , cellular , SMS , city , private video feeds , everything ! Ok , but have you heard anything ? Have you seen anything ? I 've been looking for a pattern like you said , unusual activity , lack of activity , mostly what it is is noise . Arc . That 'll cut through it . - What do you see ? - Nothing , an abandoned factory . Aren 't you curious why I brought you here ? This is a monument to your excess , your greed . Your absolute unwillingness to accept anything less than everything . This is where the disease of your industrial empire is born . I couldn 't have built all this without the ability to see what 's really around me . But I 'm curious about what you see . On our first meeting , for instance , the guards who brought you in just now . The girl . What do you see ? Observant . When she scanned me , she watched my hands , my feet , that 's smart . She 's a prude . Pretended not to be , but she is . Tired . - She 's a mother . - Because she 's tired ? She had a smell . Clean . Talc . Coloured wax . Crayons ? Under her fingernails . Domestic . It doesn 't make sense . Why would Garza want to grab him ? - He didn 't do anything to her . - It fits with Liber8 's goals . Change the future . No better way to change the future than ... Than what ? No better way to change the future than what ? - Key off Alec 's image . - Alright , alright . Change the future ... change the architecture of the future ... change the archite ... - is she gonna kill him ? - I need you to focus right now . I got him ! - They 're heading down there . - Where ? - Sadtech , site one . - Garza would take him there ? - Yeah , she 'd take him there . - Unhook me . You bring it back to life , you resurrect it , and it rewards you with an empire . That 's why being here now is so ... appropriate . You asked me for a favour . Do you know what it was ? - A what ? - A favour , idiot boy ! You , in the future , asked me for a favour . Can you guess what you wanted ? - Dating advice ? - No , silly . - I want something different this time . - It 's too late to ask for that . I 've always found you an interesting girl . Intelligent , creative . I imagine Kagame values these attributes , as well . Is that why he sent you here to kill me ? You sent me back here to kill you . But it makes no sense ! Why would I send you back to kill me ? Because you knew you were a bad , bad boy . Yeah , but I know what I 'm supposed to do , I sent back a message with Kiera ! What message ? To consider every step , to change my path ! - People don 't change . - I think they can . Oh , shit can change you , but choosing ? You don 't even know me ! What makes you think that I can 't change ? What if you could change the course of history , Jasmine ? - What if ? - I mean really change it ? - Please . - Please , what ? - Please don 't kill me . - I 'm not killing you . - I 'm saving the world . - No . But I gave you the choice , didn 't I ? I mean , people keep telling me I 'm so powerful in the future , but I gave you this decision . It 's easy to be judge and jury now when I 've done so much and made my mistakes . But I see something in you , Jasmine . I want you to decide . - I must have wanted you to decide . - Why ? Because you were on the outside . You were free of the shackles . You had perspective that I must have lost . Shit . You 're my insurance policy ! My failsafe ! - Pull that trigger , - Alec goes with me . - He 's not a part of this . - He 's all of it ! - And I decide his fate ! - Why now ? He sent me to do this ! That boy is not the man that you met . Not brilliant ? Not curious ? Not driven ? But now he understands the danger . He won 't choose that path again . We all have good intentions when we start . Don 't do it , Garza . I know who he is ! I know what he becomes ! Goddamit , neither of you know me ! You don 't know shit about me ! You only see what you don 't want me to be ! And I 'm not him ! I won 't be , not after all this ! After all this , you think this will make a difference ? I 'm 18 years old , I 'm supposed to change the world and I 'm afraid that I might , I 'm afraid that I might not ! You guys scare the shit out of me ! I just want to go home and I want to see the girl that I 'm in love with but instead I might die over something that I might not even do ! - Why would you trust me to do this ? - Because , unlike me , you 're weak enough and strong enough to love . I was willing to sacrifice myself in your office . Nothing 's changed , unless you do . [ Gunshots ] - Kiera ! - Alec ! Hold on ! - Kiera ! - Alec ! - Kiera ! I 'm slipping ! - Hold on ! - Alec , no ! - I 've got you ! I 've got you ! It 's ok , it 's ok , it 's ok . Who the hell am I in the future ? I sent you to protect me . I sent her here to kill me . - She didn 't kill you , Alec . - No , not yet . Let 's get you out of here . Come on . Why would a Liber8 terrorist do this to you ? Kill your friends , nearly kill you ! You said it yourself , they 're terrorists . - Who knows why ? - Why are you doing this ? Whatever this is ? I 'm helping the police investigate Liber8 . Kiera is one of their specialists . I think that 's all I can tell you right now . You 're going to keep doing this ? Yes , now more than ever ! Then I won 't let anything happen to either of us , I promise . When did this become the back seat at a drive-in theatre ? - My instructions were clear . - Let me make myself clear . I don 't follow instructions anymore , not from you , not from anyone . The only opinion that matters is mine . So if I say she gets to be here , then she gets to be here . Well , look at you . The boy becomes the man . I 'm sorry , I don 't recognize him . I can assure you , sir , this information is solid . So , really , it 's up to you . You can tell me everything you know about him , or in about half an hour I can have a warrant and a dozen agents in here to search every inch of this place . Please , Agent Gardner , let me see what I can do . I think I may have some older files in storage . Great , go get them . - Emily . - Hey . You saved him . Thank you . You saved him , too . - I know I 've been hard on you . - I get it . - We both care about him . - Fresh start ? Absolutely , yes , that would be ... thanks . Kiera , I ... I 'll see you around . Yeah . Forgot the damn key . Can you find the key to the storage locker and bring it in here , please ? I 'll get my partner to meet us here . [ Gunshots ] Columns ? Your guess is as good as mine . It makes it look like he 's hiding in a Roman bunker . Hmm . A bunker . So he 's underground ? The sound is compact , dense ... no echo , very little reverb . Without a GPS signal I really can 't give you much more . - So the system can fail you . - Temporarily . But not Arc . I think it saved your life . Huh . Hadn 't thought of it that way . Maybe we can use it to help find the body snatchers . Yeah , I 'll see what I can do . You ok ? Yeah , better than I expected . I realize now I was just afraid of the message . And my motives . I know now that none of that matters . There is no fate . We chart our own course , here and now . [ Phone vibrating ] It 's Gardner . Cameron . Gardner ? Hello ? Gardner .

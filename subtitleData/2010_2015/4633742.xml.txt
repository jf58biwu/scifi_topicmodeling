 Previously on Continuum . If you 're not Linda Williams , who the hell are you ? A piece of the time travel device is missing . My loyalty to Travis is second only to you and our cause . Are you hiding something Alec ? No , I 'm not hiding anything . Hey , look up ! [ gunfire ] What 's going on ? Theseus , it 's started . [ sobbing ] [ telephone ring ] Do you recognize my voice ? Where 's our ride ? Garza said she 'd be here . Not a good day to be late . Garza , where are you ? We 're gotta go ! We 're out of time ! Where the hell is she ? [ gunfire ] We gotta move ! Garza , get up here now ! [ gunfire ] Got her ! Yeah , yeah , calm down ! [ gunfire ] Come on ! Welcome home . Now what ? We wait for the inevitable fallout . Then our chance to really change things will present itself ... Edouard ? Happy Birthday ! You remembered ? I have something for you . You will find the answers to your questions here . Please keep this between us . Of course . Morning ... I thought I 'd let you sleep in . This didn 't happen . Of course it didn 't ... What are we talking about ? And it will never happen again . She 'll be back . [ cell phone rings ] Cameron ... Hey , Keira ... Was my first day back at work since the shooting and you 're late ? What 's going on ? You 're back ? Doc , cleared me for duty yesterday . Well , Dillon wants you here ASAP . There 's some pinhead CSIS agent here . Apparently a bunch of military grade explosives went missing , and the Feds think it 's linked to Julian and Liber8 . I 'll be there in 30 minutes . You better make it in 20 . - Yeah ? - Alec ... Look , I 'm working as fast as I can to deal with all this water damage . I 've been up all night . Have you heard from Julian ? I have been trying to track him down using his cell phone . I hacked it after the riots to feed me his location . So far I 've got the last coordinates , but I don 't have the computer power to triangulate . Once the system 's up and running ... Ok , well , when you find him ... I 'll let you know . I promise . Kiera , there 's something else I need to tell you ... I found something when I was hacking your CMR . Kiera ? Alec , hello ? Hello ? No cell service ? How 's it going ? All cell service is down . It should take me four hours to disarm the worm I planted in their systems . Good work ! Your loved ones , they need to be warned . You need to be warned ... I 'm not talking about the end of the world , but I AM talking about the beginning of the end . You ! - You know what I 'm talking about . - No , I 'm ... I 'm sorry . Today is the day . Everything changes , everything ! The day the movement is born to flood our minds with lies . And Glass and Metal raining down from above ! Just STOP following me ! Hey , wait , I know you , blue eyes ... You were at the execution . What did you just say ? I do know you ... You 're just like me ... You 're from the future ! CONTINUUM Series finale - Endtime It was 20 years ago ... Definitely 20 . I was monitoring the power couplings at the prison , I was charging the execution mechanism , all of a sudden , there 's a massive power surge , the equipment overloaded and the next thing I know I 'm over here , down in the waterfront , I wake up in a fishery it 's 1992 . So you know what they do ? They stick me in the nuthouse , spent the next couple of years there until the government comes along and squeezes everybody out onto the street . Squeezed it so ... Just been kind of surviving on my wits ever since ... Did I mention the fish ? This is amazing . I 've spent the last twenty years thinking I was the only one who made it through from 2077 and here you are ... Sorry , just want to make sure you 're real . You 're real . You 're good . Coms are down . Clock is running . Excellent . I thought Sonya was with you . I sent her out for an errand . What kind of errand ? A personal errand . Is there a problem ? No . So I talked to Keira . Said she 'll be here in twenty minutes . Good . This is the officer who was at the Sadler Farm with you ? Agent Cameron 's with Section Six . They 've lent her services to us to help out with our Liber8 task force . Liber8 task force ? I wasn 't aware there was one . There is . Immediately after the explosives were stolen , our agencies started monitoring Liber8 chatter in several west coast cities , our investigation circled back here . What exactly are we dealing with here ? 2,000 pounds of classified gel concentrate . Military grade . It 's enough to take out half the downtown core . Sir ? Sorry to interrupt but it 's important . All cell service in the city is still down . Signs point to some kind of hacking or sabotage . Sounds like our guys . Look who 's been using their email . Gotcha ! You know there are other time jumpers here . You mean the terrorists ? The terrorists , Liber8 , they are here too ? Yeah . Oh , that 's bad . That 's bad ! That 's really bad . No , I 'm talking about the Privateers . The ... Freelancers . Mr. Escher . And we are live again . Alec ? No , Jason . Yeah , can you hear me ? Alec , I can hear you . I 've only got audio for now . I 'm still working on video and data . You know what , I hear the voices too ! I do , it 's okay . Great , one second . What about Julian ? I 've got a possible location . I was thinking I could pick you up and we could find him ... Ok , look , patch me into Carlos and I 'll see if he can meet us there . Why bring the police involved ? Listen to me . Two days ago 2,000 pounds of explosives were stolen from a secure research facility ... And you think Julian 's involved ? This is bad . This is bad . Today 's the day Theseus will emerge ... Alec , please . I can promise you Julian will be treated fairly . But we need to bring him in . Just like Roland was ? Shoot first and ask questions later ? If the terrorists are here and the explosives are been stolen ... We gotta go , it 's too late . Too late ! Alec , please just let me talk with Carlos ... Kiera ? I can 't hear you , I 'm losing connection . Alec ? What ? Can 't hear you . Alec ? Damnit ! Alec 's okay , you can call me Alec . I have something to show you . I 've spent 15 years working on it . Top secret , I 'll show ya . What are you talking about ? I 'm talking about a working time machine . Where did Sonya go ? Don 't ask me . Nobody tells me anything . Ask Kagame . You did and he didn 't tell you . Now you know what it 's like to be one of the outer circle . You wouldn 't be messing with me , now , would you ? I 'm too smart to ... do that , Travis . Yes , you are . He 's planning something . What 's new ? [ doorbell ] Garza , you expecting somebody ? No . You ? Just some kid . Go ahead . Come on . Come on in . That 's the bridge from the night I arrived . Yeah , imagine my surprise . After all those years of waiting and waiting ... Blew up . Cracker . Oh ... Thanks . How about you show me the time machine . Yeah . Listen for a sec . The machine is legit . But there is just one small issue . I need a nanno metal circuit to focus the energy in the precise manner to dial in the return date . Those alloys , not developed , to 2034 . Do you believe in destiny , Jason ? [ laughs ] Today I do . This is amazing ... I might have to modify this just a little for my needs . Okay , how long will that take ? Not long . It 's configured structurally already ... How did you get this ? That 's not important . There is only one man I know of who could 've developed this tech . You 're CPS . How do I know you didn 't come back here to arrest me . I am not here to arrest you , Jason . I want to go home . Do you want to go back to 2077 ? Badly . I can help you with that . When is Agent Cameron coming in ? She said 20 minutes when I talked to her ... That was 35 minutes ago . It 's nice that the boys at Section Six let her come down , work here full time . It 's not their usual protocol . Yeah , I wouldn 't know . And I 'd like to know why this Section Six hasn 't been filing reports about this task force with my office . Well you have to ask her when she gets here ? I will ... When she gets here . - Excuse me . - Yes , sir . It 's Gardiner . I want you to run a check on an outfit called Section Six ... Yeah , I 've never heard of them either . It 's the memorial . That 's exactly what I 've been trying to tell you . Today is the day the sculpture becomes a memorial . That 's right , the building comes down . Glass and steel raining down . It was the first attack on the city , thousands of people were killed . It was 2012 . Thousands of people were killed and it is 2012 . And today is the day . It 's today . All the more reason we need to fire up the machine and get the hell outta here . Oh no ... Don 't do this . We met for a reason . We have to go . We need to get home before Theseus unleashes hell . If we wait until after it happens , who knows what the repercussions might be . The power could get cut . The authorities could come and shut this place down . Nothing will be the same here in a few hours . I know . And I want to get home Jason . more than anything . But I can 't let thousands of people die even if there 's a small chance I may be able to change what 's happening . You were right ... We have to warn them . I 'm truly sorry about your father . He was a good man , who understood the danger we face from the corporations . They shot him in cold blood . Took his life like it was nothing . And they will take all of our lives and our freedoms , unless we stop them . I want to stop them . I 'm willing to do whatever it takes . Sometimes we must inspire others with a personal sacrifice . A statement that moves a generation of followers . You understand ? It would have to be a statement that changed everything . I promise you . It will be . What 's he doing here ? What am I doing here ? ! Are you kidding me ? You know him ? My stepbrother , Alec . - What the hell are you doing here ? - I was looking for you Julian ! I thought you were in trouble . Any trouble that I 've found is of your doing . My father would still be alive if you hadn 't helped those cops . - He knows us . - Yes , he does . How do you know us , Alec ? From the news . That must be it . - We should ... - We will . - You 've got to take care of this . - In my own way . Take him . - Julian ! - Come on ! Julian ! Come on ! We 're going to be late . Is that too tight ? You think I 'm pretty ? What ? We will write history together , brother . And millions will respect your name . It 's not safe . I want you to stay here . And miss the chance to change history ? No way . Maybe that 's why we were sent back in . We weren 't sent back . Really ? It was an inside job you know ? The execution . The device . The explosion . The Guards , the Warden ... Who knows how high it went . Come on , let 's go . Amazing . Not from where I 'm sitting . You spoke of this moment once ... But that conversation won 't take place for 60 years . Was I tied to a chair then ? No ... I was . You imagined someone could get a message to their younger self ... Offer them the kind of wisdom and knowledge that might affect the course of their life and in turn affect the course of history . That 's great . Did the future me happen to mention that all this business took place in my past , or are we breaking new ground right now ? Well that 's no help . I 'm knowing for sure that I 'm going to survive long enough to make that meeting would certainly change how I handle this situation . You really don 't understand how important you are , do you ? No , I understand more than you realize ... What I don 't understand is how you and your gang could possibly think you could change the inevitable . A pebble tossed from a beach can becomes a Tsunami on the other side of the world . You are that pebble ... And I am standing on a beach on the other side of time ! Waiting for that tidal wave to crash . Yeah , you 're standing on a beach , we 're facing a Tsunami but you 've only got a bucket to change it . And yeah , you could scoop a small amount of water from that wave , and change history slightly . But that 's it ! The wave still hits ! It will probably drown you . And if I 'm that pebble , then progress and innovation is the wave . And it will make the world a better place . And that you can 't change . But that 's precisely my point , Alec . You 're the one who convinced me I can ... Alright , which one of these buildings is the target ? I was kind hoping you 'd remember . This is history to me . I don 't remember specifics . You 're the one who 's been doing the research . - So just ... think ! - Okay , okay . I don 't remember . Then we 'll have to warn all of them . Okay , this one ! [ telephone ringing ] Thanks , that 's what I thought . Someone went to a lot of trouble to put her in a position of trust ... No . Let 's keep this on a need to know . If she is working for Liber8 , I don 't want to tip our hand that we know she 's one of them . We need to evacuate the premises immediately . Yeah , right . Get on the phone , call the police . Ask for inspector Dillon , he will vouch for me . Typically the agency 's ... Sir , I got Keira on line 3 . Yeah , Keira . Sir . I 'm at City Plaza . I believe that Liber8 is going to bring down one of the buildings with a bomb but I can 't be certain which one it is . I need your approval to evacuate all of them immediately . Inspector this is now a matter of National Security . I 'm officially taking over . I 'll take care of it Keira stay where you are . Thank you . We need to treat this as a real bomb threat . Yes we do . So we send down the bomb squad and the ER team . You 're coming with me . We 're going to go to the Plaza and find your partner , let 's go . Everyone let 's go ! Where have you been ? On an errand . What kind of errand ? I had some business to do for Kagame ! It 's nothing . Why are you so upset ? Something 's going on . Something you 're not telling me . What are you not telling me , Sonya ? You know what you need to know . And when Kagame wants you to know more he 'll tell you . To hell with Kagame ! Kagame is our leader . Not you . He was then . But now ... he 's strayed from the very plan he laid out in 2077 . - He 's lied to us ... - No , he hasn 't . He said we would go back six years . It 's been 65 . I get the feeling that was the plan all along . What is your design ? You are a very important member of this cell . Kagame has his reasons . We have to trust them . Carlos . Good . I need your help organizing the second building ... Don 't worry about that Agent Cameron , we 've got it under control , thank you . Kiera , this is Agent Gardiner from CSIS . I 've been wanting to meet you . I 'm interested in hearing how you obtained this information . I will tell you all of that later , but right now ... I think right now would be an appropriate time , Agent Cameron . I have informants , sir . - With Section Six ? - Yes . Hey , I ... , I told her . Well I helped her remember . See , she and I are from the future ... Hey ! Hey ! I think we have a problem here . An unauthorized vehicle has just pulled in . This guy one of yours ? That 's Julian Randol . Get everyone out of here ! Everybody out ! Theseus . Put your hands in the air and step out of the vehicle ! Put the switch down son ! Rot in hell ! [ click , click , click ] Take him ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Get the hell off of me ! Get off of me ! Get him out of here , now ! Come on ! Let 's move ! Everybody go ! Right this way ! Detonator wasn 't connected . Explosives neutralized . Copy . Situation under control . I believe you were about to answer some questions for me , Agent Cameron . Still interested in knowing who those contacts are . [ cell phone ringing ] Looks like cell service has been restored . Gardiner here . Yes , Sir . Understood , Sir . Thank you . I just received a call from my supervisor , Agent Cameron . He let me know that he has been contacted with your commander , Mr. Esher , and that I am to cooperate fully here on with Section Six ... Excuse me . I 've never seen CSIS back down to anyone like that before . I 'd like to meet your boss and shake his hand . So would I. Hey , look , it 's not broken ! You changed history . She changed history over here . Alright blue eyes , we 've got a time machine waiting for us . Let 's go , let 's go ! Tell you what . I 'll meet you there . Okay . The time 's a wasting . - But don 't take too long . - I won 't . Let me guess , It 's complicated . Yeah . It wasn 't my fault , something happened with the bomb . I tried the detonator ... it didn 't go off . Someone sabotaged it . It wasn 't supposed to work . What ? Listen to me . This battle isn 't over . It 's hardly begun . There are many ways to sacrifice . None more noble than the other ... We will meet again . Kagame ! Keira ! It 's building two . I saw a map . They 're going to blow building two . No , Alec , listen , it 's okay . We got Julian . - He was in the building one . - You don 't understand . I was at their hideout . I saw their plans . Julian was just a diversion ... Kagame . Alec , stay here . Kagame ! If you shoot me , you risk losing everything . Where 's the bomb ? Do not do this . Have you forgotten your history lessons ? It 's already done . No , this doesn 't have to happen . We can change history . That 's my role to play in the larger plan . Whose plan ? His ! What ? What are you talking about ? Explain yourself . That would take too much time . I 'm on a schedule and this bomb is set to go off and none of us can stop it . Alec will explain ... What 's he talking about ? He 's going to do it , trust me , we gotta go . Come on ! We have a possible sighting of Eduoard Kagame entering building 2 . - Are you sure ? - We have to evacuate ! Keira was just ... [ explosion ] [ explosion ] [ explosion ] [ coughing ] [ coughing ] Go ! I know you . Mrs. Kagame . Yes . A friend of mine asked me to give this to you . I can 't answer your questions , you just have to trust me . Thank you . Sonya . You followed me ? Where 's Kagame ? Come with me . What are you doing here ? Kagame was in the building when it exploded . What are you talking about ? - I thought Julian was ... - No . Kagame had planned this all along ... Today it 's his birthday . He 's here ? Down the hall . Just born . He told me some things . He asked me to make arrangements for his mother ... Make arrangements for him . What are you talking about ? He said we would meet again and it would all make sense ... He also told me that after he died today , he wanted me to do something very important . He wanted me to succeed him . Jason ? What took you so long ? Well , it blew anyway . The building . We didn 't change history . Not yet . Which means all the horrible things are going to happen and there 's nothing we can do . Show me the time machine ... Let me get the lights . [ laughs ] ♪ It 's a beauty , isn 't it ? Yeah . We 'll be wearing these . I 'll fit one for you . We 'll hold here . Massive pulse , down through here , up by the ball ... ♪ Seems I can 't get rid of you . Did you have anything to do with this ? No . Not in this year . Not in 2076 . I told you I was just a pawn . My cover was almost blown today . Someone vouched for me ... It wasn 't Alec ... That leaves you . It wasn 't me . Must have been your guardian angel . Or a freelancer . A who ? Never mind . I guess I can 't change history after all . I 'll get us out of here . - You 're alive ? - Of course . I knew what was going to happen to the Congress . That 's impossible ... How could you know ? How I knew , and how I came to be the man I am today , is going to become clear to you ... What is that ? The culmination of my life 's work ... You and I have more in common than you realize , Edouard . I don 't understand . You will ... You will . Have you ever stood on a beach and faced an approaching tsunami ? You have taught me everything I know , Theseus . Tell me now , can I trust him ? My brother ? Who knows ? Who knows ... But you will do as he proposes , and I will do my best to prepare you . You there ? Yeah , I 'm here . I don 't know how to say this . Just say it , Alec . Your journey here was no accident . The time travel device didn 't malfunction , and Kagame knew this ... The truth is , I 'm the one who sent you back in time ... And you 're not going to believe why .

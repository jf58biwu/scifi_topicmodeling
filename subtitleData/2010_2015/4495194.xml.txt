If you 'll break your vow ... If you won 't ... Okay ? Will you break your vow ? This is for you . I ground garlic , ginger , onion , wasabi and capsaicin all together . Drink it when it 's cool . Won 't you give up ? I didn 't want external fertilization . But I heard that you human beings ejaculate when choked to death Forgive me ... It hurts so badly . My son . You are still a sinner who can only think about your own pain . Dad , forgive me . Your pain is nothing but the signal sent by your brain . What you really need to be afraid of is that you and this entire world could be ruined by your sin . How dare you ? Dad ... I got the wavelength . It 's 4 kilometers away from here , the northwest . Check out the box and the location of wavelength . Yes , sir . Dad ... Dad ... Ms. Monica ... Monica , are you alright ? What is the exact location ? The signal is getting weak . It 's hard to figure out the exact location but it 's within a 20-meter radius . How did it go ? I got the wavelength of fertilization . This way . Mo ... Ms. Monica . Ms. Monica . Ms. Hamonica ... Ms. Hamonica ... I 'm really sorry . Ms. Monica ? Don 't ... kill ... me ... I 'll protect you , Ms. Monica . We must go to a district office together . Wait ! We are from a secret agency dealing with the aliens . Two years ago , a planet which was 8,435,434,948,040km away from the earth suddenly had disappeared . Many scientists suggested various hypotheses to figure out the reason but none of them were right . And then , a huge meteorite landed in Seoul recently . The troops , the National Intelligence Service and the secret agency were called out , but it was empty , and the living thing in that meteorite disappeared . According to the investigation , that meteorite was a part of planet that had disappeared two years ago and the living thing in it was an extraterrestrial with incredible adaptability to any environment . Plus , it was the reason of the explosion of that planet . That planet couldn 't bear this living thing 's astonishing velocity of evolution . There was constant conflict of dimension and it ended in explosion . Because this living thing 's time-system changed the planet 's time-system too quickly . And ... The earth is in great danger . It is possible that our planet might be destroyed exactly like that planet as well . What the hell are you talking about ? The extraterrestrial inside her body doesn 't have the same time-system like ours . But the earth is the planet for human beings . If the earth moved on their time system , our life could be shortened to a single day . To save our earth and human beings we must kill that thing . That 's the only way where we can protect our time system . I don 't believe it . No ! I will protect you . We must go to a district office together . Can you hear that ? How can I catch it ? With a wavelength detector . Hurry up ! Stop ! Don 't come near me . You killed Ms. Monica . And you 're trying to destroy the earth . I won 't let you do that . She had been dead even before you met her . I just used her body for a moment . You would destroy the earth just like you did to her . I would not destroy the earth . Just by your existence , the earth will be destroyed . You and I exist in different dimensions . Nonsense ! Why ? Why do you look just like me ? The half of my genes is from yours . You don 't know anything about pregnancy and childbirth . Baby can be born after 37 weeks of pregnancy , and before that , we call it premature birth . But you just had 2 hours . My time-system is not equal to yours . The time-system of Ms.Monica and the earth is not equal to yours , either . All living things in this universe live by their own time-system . Don 't come into my time-system any more . I must protect the earth ! Once upon a time , there lived a woodsman called ' Wangjil ' in China during the Qin dynasty . One day , he went into the mountain to gather some firewood and saw two men play go . He thought it was interesting , so he sat down and watched their play . Before long , one of them took out something and gave it to Wangjil . It looked like a mandarin , and he didn 't feel hungry at all after he ate it . After one round of go , one of them said to Wangjil that his ax became rusty . So Wangjil hurried off to the town with his rusty ax and found people were preparing for ancestor worship ceremony in his house . Thought it was strange , he asked someone about the reason and heard that a long time ago , their great-grandfather called ' Wangjil ' suddenly had disappeared so they had this memorial ceremony on that day since then . His parents and children no longer existed . - from the Chinese legend

 Julia : Previously on helix ... Alan : You believe you can save her ? No , but julia can . It 's incredible . So it worked . Ugh , this migraine , it 's killing me . It 's not a migraine . A strike team will storm the base , looking for the virus , And leave nothing behind . There is a bunker underneath the base . We will be safe there . This was not your call to make ! I had a theory . A theory that could get us all killed ! We can save everyone . We can get peter back . ( vectors shrieking ) I think it 's working . ( vectors shrieking ) Anana : This is a picture of me and my brothers , twins . If you scatter to the wind , you still have a fighting chance . You can be the man you want to be , Not the man they made you . There is just one . They call him the scythe . Initiate video . I need to speak with him immediately . Location unknown , but I 'm happy To report the cure does exist . Yeah , no shit . Now , can I please have my to-do list , So he can enjoy all the credit and I can get on with it ? We 're in a bunker hiding for our lives . Would you choose diet ? Is there scotch involved in this scenario ? There is another way . Hatake 's escape tunnel . We can get everyone out of the base . No , that 's just it , sarah . They will find us and they will kill us all . And that 's not the worst of it . What we 've seen of the virus so far , It 's small scale . Ilaria has worldwide ambitions , And we can 't let them succeed . There is no running , no hiding . Either they survive , or we do . You 're healing fast . Don 't worry . Daniel will be back soon . A parent always worries . I 'm sure he 'll find the last group of scientists . For his own sake , I hope not . It is too late for them . ( hatch opening ) The others ? Did you find duchamp ? That 's bennett . Chang , triantis . I just can 't help thinking whoever did this ... Was inhuman . Was just like me . From what I can see , the scythe is a true sociopath . Ilaria 's hatchet man . And yet your father worked for the very same corporation . How do you defend that ? I don 't . Not anymore . I need a minute . We need to keep moving , keep out of the open . They could be watching . I 'm hoping that 's exactly what they 're doing , and we can lure them out . Jesus . That 's your plan ? I need you down in the cabin . I 've tasked sarah with keeping people calm And organized , but ... They know you down there and they could use your help . Given everything I 've done , That may not be the best idea . Sarah : I 'm still trying to wrap my head around all this . Which part ? Curing your incurable cancer , Or figuring out what to do with the next thousand years ? Sorry . It 's not funny . No , it kind of is . I 'm really grateful to you for saving my life . And there 's something to be said for never having a cold again , Or getting to work in the hot lab without gloves . Not to mention looking like you 're 26 forever . Seriously ? That 's how this works ? I can understand it on a cellular level , But hatake telling me he was born in 1501 ? Sarah : That makes him 513 . And doesn 't look a day over 500 . ( both laughing ) All I 've ever wanted was to make my mark on the world . You know ? Put my name on something That really changed people 's lives . And I know that this may sound naive , But I feel like with enough time we can do anything . It 's a lot of options to consider . I know . People don 't like what they don 't understand . We 're gonna have to hide what we are , Not just from ilaria but the rest of the world . Everyone around us will eventually die . Friends , family . I don 't know if I can handle that . Let 's hope we get the chance . The next 12 hours , ilaria is gonna try and wipe this base Off the face of the earth with us inside . ( engines revving ) Balleseros : We made good time today . Nearly 40km . We rest here . At dawn , split into smaller groups to hide our numbers . Take off in four-hour intervals , maintain radio silence , Then we 'll meet at the rendezvous in nunavut . Speaks like he 's one of us . We all just fall in line , no questions ? He may not be one of us , But he 's a born leader with tactical skills we need . I don 't think it 's his tactics you 're admiring . I 'm not blind to his faults . But he knows the ilaria corporation and her methods . That 's ' cause he 's one of them . He 's a hired gun ! He doesn 't have any loyalties . He saved my life . He saved our people . You really think we 're that special to him ? In a couple days out on the ice , We 're gonna make him forget who he really is ? No . But I trust him . And what if you 're wrong ? Then I 'll gut the son of a bitch myself . ( theme music playing ) I got something . From six hours ago . My god , he 's young . His name is spencer chissik , But he prefers the name of his weapon of choice , a scythe . And this child is responsible for all those people on the elevator ? Hatake : Don 't let his appearance deceive you . He has spent centuries perfecting the art of human suffering . We would be foolish to underestimate him . Well , we have one advantage . They will underestimate us . Spencer : Where are they ? They 're in hatake 's office . It 's too easy . Why are they just walking around in the open like that ? Perhaps their curiosity got the best of them . No , hatake 's too smart for that . ( banging ) Would someone please shut her up ? ( container beeping ) ( steady beeping ) oh , my god . I ... What is it ? Security footage . From four days ago . It 's sutton . Show me . I 'm so ... Show me . ( sutton yelling ) ( sutton choking ) I 'm so sorry . I will avenge my mother . ( sutton yelling ) ( sutton choking ) I think you should hear this . Our friends are about to lead us to what we came for . Hatake : It will never work . Alan : Why not ? Daniel : It looks like there 's only three of them . Even the remaining vectors have more sense than you . They are hiding , as we should be . Is that true ? No sign of them anywhere . We are in this situation Because you brought narvik back to the base . Without the narvik , there wouldn 't be a cure . Now we have both . Ilaria has invested tens of millions . They will not allow narvik or the cure to be destroyed . Well , it 's a good thing we 're not asking their permission . Here 's the plan . Daniel , you 'll create a base-wide diversion . Hatake and I will go after and retrieve the virus and the cure . And then it 's a race to the incinerator . Hatake : Agreed . It 's a bold plan , but it should work . Hiroshi . Taking orders in your own home . I almost feel sorry for him . What do you want us to do ? Suit up . Let 's finish what my mother started . ( motor starting ) You and I need to talk . Good idea . Let 's wait until nunavut , where it 's warmer . I want you to stay away from my sister . Why not ask her about that ? She won 't listen to me . What makes you think I will ? My sister thinks she can change you . But you and I , we know the truth . Yeah ? What 's that ? That you don 't give a shit about anybody but yourself . Yep . I 'm out here risking my life because I enjoy the scenery . You 're doing this for anana ? Because you care ? What does it matter why I do this ? Because you 're gonna hurt her . Maybe not tomorrow . But you will . Maybe she wants to get hurt . Maybe you should get on that snowmobile and keep riding ! You know , you kind of remind me of someone . If you truly care about her , you 'll go . Can you hand me a torque wrench and a 3 / 8 socket ? It 's the one that looks like , uh ... ( chuckles ) thank you . You really think alan 's plan 's gonna work ? You think they were watching us ? I 'm sure they were . I never thought I 'd be wishing I was back in bolivia . Bolivia . Capital is sucre . Major export , petroleum gas . You 've been ? No . Encyclopedia britannica . Hatake gave me one for my seventh birthday . You grew up here ? Yeah . Never left . Not even to travel ? I never left because I believed in hatake and his work . I thought I was somehow part of it , But it turns out everything he did was for you . Daniel , I ... It 's not your fault . I chose to stay . And when all this is done , I 'm gone . If we get out of this , I just want you to know you can treat me like a sister . Thank you . But I already have one . We need to get going . ( snowcat beeping ) You risk too much . Spencer is centuries old , an expert in tactics . I 'd rather go on the offensive than sit around waiting to die . You 're impetuous like your brother . Don 't bring him into this . I 've met many men like you . They are only able to see what is now , Not what is coming over the horizon . And you 're so consumed with the long view , You can 't see what 's right in front of you . I have dedicated many lifetimes Trying to engineer the virus , To give humanity the greatest gift . Immortality . Even if it were true , How is that your gift to give ? An end to suffering , Disease , war , And death . We will change the world . Gunnar suffered , went insane , killed himself . You murdered sutton . How has your immortality improved your humanity at all ? You do not understand . System voice : Biohazard . Biohazard . There 's the diversion . Biohazard . Let 's get the virus . ( mechanical whirring ) Stay where you are ! Put your hands where I can see them . Hiroshi . Spencer . Don 't ever call me that . You know what I want . I only know you are as foolish now As when we first met , A 15-year old still clinging to his mother 's skirts . Yes , my poor mother . You will answer to the board for her . But first , my virus . Come and get it . ( screaming ) ( gunshots ) What happened ? Did the trap work ? We got one of them . Spencer is still alive . Well , it 's one less we have to deal with . Hatake : The other two are meaningless . We had our chance . We will not have another . We can 't stand around discussing this . We need to get back to the cabin . We 're just gonna hide ? We have the virus , cure , enough food to wait them out . If spencer 's anything like sutton , I 'll take my chances in the cabin . It 's settled . We go downstairs . No more traps . I can 't believe thea would fall for that . She was reckless . She underestimated hatake , as did my mother . Why allow hatake into her room in the first place ? Speak clearly . What threw sutton off ? Why didn 't she just kill him ? Yet you were willing to throw it all away . For what ? This abomination ? Was it worth it ? Chasing the willis hypothesis to protect your daughter ? Your daughter ? I mean , how ? That 's impossible . What 's the willis hypothesis ? The ravings of a madman , One who can no longer be allowed To propagate his insane ideals . Listen to me , blake , my love . I have a very important job for you . I need you to figure out everything you can About that daughter . Now . ( tropical music playing in elevator ) System voice : Level b . It 's almost over , jules . I wish I believed that . Level c . So do I. It felt good to say it , anyway . ( thud ) ( elevator powering down ) What was that ? Breaker must have tripped . Happens about once a month . Julia : You sure that 's all it is ? System voice : Service error . Service error . Hey . Something 's wrong . They should be back by now . I know . Well , we should go look for them . No one in , no one out . That 's what alan said . Oh , wow , don 't quote alan 's rules back to me . I had enough of that growing up . Has he always been such a stickler ? Are you kidding ? We got in a fight once because I pulled one of those tags off a pillow . I 'm sure they 'll be back soon . And if not ? What then ? Alan will be back . How do you know ? Because I know . You really care for him , don 't you ? I do . He 's my mentor . ( chuckles ) Your mentor . So that 's why you came up here even though you 're sick ? I came up here because it 's my job . Right . Why did you come up here ? To run away after you slept with julia ? I slept with julia because I loved her . System voice : Service error . ( tropical music playing ) Where 's julia ? System voice : Level d . She was right next to me . How the hell did she get out ? He has her . Alan : Well , then we have to go back upstairs . No . He knows she is my daughter . We must follow spencer 's rules now . What , and leave her up there with that lunatic ? Of course not . They will only inflict more pain . We must wait . Alan : I have to go back up . We can 't just sit around waiting for some list of demands . I told you . We must not provoke him further . I don 't want to provoke him . I want to rip his head off . As do I. But that is what he wants . To unbalance us . He 's succeeding . Be patient , then . Spencer will come when he 's ready . ( knocking ) " to the traitor hiroshi . " ( all clamoring ) Man : No . Everybody just quiet ! Move aside . This is exactly what the scythe wants . You once told me , to react in anger is to act against yourself . That was before my daughter 's safety was threatened . Perhaps one day , When you have a family of your own ... I thought I did . You cannot stop me . Maybe not . But I can slow you down . Alan : Stop it ! Stop it ! We 're playing right into his hands . Are you telling me you would not sacrifice your own life for julia ? Of course I would , unless there were any other way . What did the note say again ? " she has nine more fingers , " but I only had one mother . " come directly to isolation . " the longer you wait , " the less of your daughter will be left . " This is between spencer and me . I will go to him . Alone . That 's suicide . There is no other way . He 's right . He has to go alone or julia dies . She 's dead either way . You think he 's just gonna let her walk out of there ? No , but I 'll be damned if I 'm letting that ... That boy do any more harm to her . Ow ! Anana : What did you do ? What did I do when ? Stop it ! Not until you tell me what you said to sergio ! I didn 't say anything . Don 't you lie to me ! Qamut saw you two talking last night . I was only looking out for you . Who asked you to ? He 's not one of us . He is not one of anybody ! He was helping us , you idiot ! Stop , anana ! People don 't change ! He would 've turned on us ! You 're wrong about him ! You and miksa both ! The halothane gas system is confined to the ducts By a series of metal louvers . If we can divert the gas , we could knock them all out And get dr . Walker back . The louvers will need to be reset manually , Which means somebody will need to go back up into the ducts . I 've been up there . I 'll go . Peter : I 'll go with you . No , no , peter , you are still recovering . I 'm fine . Besides , who knows his way around those ducts better than me ? You 're willing to give up everything for julia ? Even your own life ? Yes , of course . She 's my daughter . And if it were your son ? You know the answer . And yet you built this place for a daughter , And then lied to your son about it . Daniel . Miksa , I ... You don 't need to explain . She 's your blood . You 've been a good son . I wish I could have been a better father . Spencer : Uh-uh-uh-uh . I would not do that if I were you . Mercury sensors are attached to the trigger mechanism . Any sudden movement , and the device will go off . What is this thing ? Simple explosive fitted to a collar . A little trick I picked up from the colombians . Why ? See , your father , he 's quite fond Of separating people from their heads . I figured I 'd return the favor . You 're worried about him . I 'm worried about all of us . If it was my father ... He 's not my real father . He 's the man who stole me from my family . What kind of a monster does something like that ? The same man who 's out there Right now risking his life for julia . That doesn 't excuse what he did . No , it doesn 't . But I 'm sure he would do the same for you . You sound like you 're on his side . I 'm not taking any sides . But even monsters have their reasons . ( panting ) There 's a t-intersection up ahead , And that 's where the louvers are . Peter : No , I don 't think so . It 's a dead end up there . You want to lead ? Hey , I 've spent a lot more time up here than you . Well , you should have thought of that before we got in here . This reminds me of hiding in the attic When the old man was on one of his benders . Well , that was usually me hiding . You were more often in the line of fire . I did have a knack for getting in his way . You 're right , it 's a dead end . Told you . In case you 're interested , t-intersection 's down here . I guess you did spend some time up here . I was , uh , infected . I ... I don 't really remember this . Uh-huh . Hatake . Are you in position ? Almost there . Yes , it 's cramped , yes , we 're hungry , and we could probably all Use a hot shower . If you want to take your chances out there , Go right ahead . Otherwise , please be patient . We 're not the enemy . Daniel . Daniel . Daniel ? I have what you want . ( grunting with effort ) It feels like it hasn 't been opened in years . Dad may have been an angry prick , But he was right about one thing . Always bring wd-40 . Here , let 's try it from the bottom . I think we 'll get better leverage up here . What are you doing ? Come on . Hey , just because it 's not your way doesn 't make it the wrong way . You never listen . ( scoffs ) Are you kidding ? That 's all I do . You never take me seriously . That is not true . Yeah ? Then let 's try it my way . From the top . ( air gushing ) Hatake , the last of the vents is open , And we 're ready for the gas . Do you hear me ? Do you copy me ? The vent is open And we 're ready for the halothane gas . Dr. Hatake , can you read me ? What 's he waiting for ? Hatake ? Do you read me ? I repeat . The vent is open . We 're ready for the gas . Spencer . Hiroshi . Took you long enough . I was just about to go in there and slice off Another piece of your daughter . Just 20 seconds shy . Thank you . You can run along now . Go check on our friend . Let julia go , and you can do with me as you please . I will not fight you . That 's very generous of you . Sacrificing yourself for a loved one . There 's nothing quite like a bond between a parent and a child . I know that now , since you took my mother From me . My life for hers . I 'm begging you . It doesn 't quite look like you 're begging . Try again , but this time on your knees . Please . Let my daughter live . ( chuckling ) You know , I never thought I 'd see the day . But it 's just the beginning . Behind the glass , your daughter . But wait . Daniel . This is barbaric , Even by your standards . You will answer to the board ! Where was your concern for the board when you killed my mother ? She would have killed me . Only had you let her . And it would have spared you the decision you now have to make . What do you want ? The virus ? I already have the virus . What I want is for you to make a choice . One lives , and one dies . It 's completely up to you . I refuse to play your sick game . I think you will , 'cause , see , if you fail to choose I kill both of them . Oh , and what fun is a game If it 's not against the clock ? So , who will it be ? The miracle that is your biological daughter , Or your loyal son Who dedicated his life to you ? You will kill them both . I will not . One of them loses their head , and one of them goes free . That is a promise . No . I cannot . You will . I will not ! Say goodbye to your children , then , hiroshi . Stop . You don 't have to choose . Daniel . There is no decision to make . Daniel , please . Don 't do anything foolish . I love , you , father . I always will . And I forgive you . Daniel ! Daniel . Did that make you feel powerful ? No , but this does . ( computers beeping ) Mom ?

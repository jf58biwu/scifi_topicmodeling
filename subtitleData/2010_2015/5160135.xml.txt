 Previously on Fringe Through suffering , comes redemption . Through sorrow , comes exaltation . Through pitch dark , comes a cleansing fire . Through the fire , we shall find a spring of new life . Mommy ? Max ? There 's a monster in my closet . No monsters here . None there either . Looks like your room is officially monster-free tonight , kiddo Now , you remember what big boys do to get rid of monsters in their room ? Well , you close your eyes , and you count to three . - And when we open them ? - The monster 's gone . You get some rest , Sweetie . I love you . One , two three . ... polls show that most Americans oppose the proposed law to limit the number of children to two per family ... however , leading politicians from two of the three major parties favor the law ... Hey . You . W-what are you doing here ? Can I buy you breakfast ? Thank you . Thanks . I need to get into the DoD facility on Liberty Island , and I need your help . I can steal a boat , but I can 't leave it docked on the island , otherwise the security patrol would find it , and I need some time inside the building alone I just need you to get me across the water . Across the patrolled water . You 're with Fringe Division . Don 't you have super-secret clearance or something ? Why you breaking into a government building ? Because I have to go home . Oh , so home is on Liberty Island now . It doesn 't matter where I 'm from . What matters is that I 'm in trouble , and I think that my time is running out here , and right now you are the only person that I 'm willing to trust . I need your help , Henry . Please , will you help me ? So if all you 're asking for is a ride ... you ain 't got to steal a boat . My cousin has one . Just give me a day or so . Thank you . - Yeah . Okay , there 's my number . I gotta go . Hey . Those people you 're running away from , they still after you ? Not if they keep believing that I 'm somebody else , no . Thanks . We 'll let you know if Fringe Division officially assumes the case . Thanks . Appreciate it . So what do we have ? Kid was abducted from his bedroom last night . Okay , we 're good down here Molecular cohesion intact . Atmosphere readings are solid . You know , these kidnappings are tragic , but ninety-nine percent of them have nothing to do with Fringe Division . Yeah , tell that to the Secretary . The Peter Bishop Act of ' 91 says every kidnapping gets treated like a possible fringe event . All I 'm saying is that these cops don 't need us to work their cases . Okay ? Waste of manpower . It 's not a waste . I 'll get a statement . Let 's check upstairs . Detective ? Would you mind walking us through the scene ? Sure . Uh , victim is Max Clayton . Eight years old . Mom came in to check on him in the morning , and he was gone . We found a couple of partial prints on the windowsill and in the closet , but we 're still collecting evidence . We believe the suspect snatched the kid , and he fled out the window . Well , it 's a long way down , especially if you 're carrying a fifty-pound kid . Okay , so the suspect is probably male , strong , say twenty to thirty-five . Hey , can I see that for a second ? There 's some kind of residue on these fingerprints . Sucrose . Sugar ? What , was he eating cookies or something ? He secretes it through his sweat . The Candy Man ... He 's back . Mister Secretary . I just heard . Fringe Division was created to investigate tragedies of unimaginable scale . You and I both know that there 's no crime more heinous than the theft of a child . I 'll do everything I can to find him , sir . I don 't doubt your resolve , Philip . Actually , that 's why I 'm here . There 's no shame in letting it fall to another desk if it 's too ... personal . It 's been four years since the Candy Man took my son . Four years ... since I heard him laugh or watched him play outside with his sister . He had my son for two days . When I got him back , he wasn 't a little boy anymore . If there 's anyone you want on this case ... it 's me . Very well . My only concern is that I don 't have all of my agents to help me . How long until this is over , sir ... until our Olivia comes home ? You 'll be happy to know we made a breakthrough . We found something in her brain chemistry , something unique . If it 's what enables her to cross between worlds , you 'll have your team back very soon . I know what it 's like to lose a son . And even when they come back , the damage is irreparable . If you need someone to talk to , Philip , let me know . We need a lead , folks . Something to go on . It 's been eighteen hours since the Clayton boy went missing . That gives us until tomorrow night to find him . The Candy Man 's last kidnapping was two years ago , before you joined Fringe Division . I remember when this happened , reading about it , but they never said what he did to these kids . It 's like they 've had the life drained out of them . Acute deterioration of organ tissue , depleted immune systems Some of the kids even came back with cancer . Those incisions - - why there ? Posterior cerebral cortex . From that point on the body , you can access the spine . Okay , Astrid ? What do we know about these cases ? The abductions themselves appear to be random , occurring every two years . The victims are always children ages seven through nine . They are taken , then released forty-eight hours later with massive internal degradation . The victims describe the suspect as male , age unknown . In the majority of cases , other than a shaved head , there 's no physical description given , because he wore a mask . - What do you mean in ' the majority of cases ' ? Two of the victims reported being held captive by two suspects , one young and one old . Then why haven 't we expanded the profile to look for two suspects ? Liv , these kids were really scared . There 's a lot of inconsistencies in their statements . Well , that doesn 't mean that they 're not true . Can you please pull up the victim 's bios ? Okay , Amanda Holt and Christopher ... Broyles . We should speak to Christopher again . That 's not a good idea , Liv . You weren 't here when it happened . Broyles is protective . Well , we should at least ask . - Liv . Don 't even think about it . I would like to reinterview your son . Excuse me ? Christopher reported that he was held by two men . An older man and a younger man . Now , if that 's true , He may remember other things about this guy that could help our investigation . Agent Dunham ... my son went through something no child should ever have to go through . And when he came home ... I had to ask him questions about it . Going over the details again and again , forcing him to relive it . when all he wanted to do was forget . And for what ? I didn 't solve the case . And I didn 't help my little boy sleep at night . I 'm sure that you did your best . But if I spoke to him , maybe I could get more out of him . I 'm his father . Perhaps that 's the problem . Maybe there are some things that you don 't want to hear . Now , there 's something I want you to hear . My son 's condition since he was taken ... has deteriorated so rapidly that he 'll be lucky if he makes it to his eighteenth birthday . Now , what little childhood Christopher has left , I intend to protect it . I get that . But Christopher 's childhood is not the only one at stake right now . You 're dismissed . I don 't feel good . I want to go home . Through suffering comes redemption . Through sorrow comes exaltation . Through the pitch dark comes the cleansing fire ... and through the fire , we shall find the spring of new life . GLEN COVE , NEW YORK ... devotes his life to righting wrongs ... protecting the innocent ... and punishing the guilty . Cranston is known to the underworld as ' The Shadow ' . Never seen , only heard ... his true identity is known only to his constant friend and aide Margo Lane . Today 's story ... There 's been a police officer parked out front all afternoon . So it 's true ? The Candy Man 's back ? Yeah . Do you think he 'll try to come back here ? No ... It is just for my peace of mind . How 's Christopher ? He 's scared . The story about the missing boy 's been all over the news today . Did you eat ? Not since breakfast . Has there been any progress in the case ? No . One of my agents wanted to reinterview Chris . Olivia Dunham . She thinks there may be some detail he 's forgotten . I told her it was a waste of time . I 've always liked Olivia . She seems very smart . I 'm gonna go put him to bed . He 's a strong boy , Philip ... strong enough to talk about it ... even if you 're not . Thought you might be hungry too . " Red Vines " ? They 're new . Charlie tried them and said they 're great . Thanks . So after the victims were abducted , the kids came back with massive cell degeneration and internal-organ atrophy . All those conditions are symptomatic of old age too , right ? I suppose so . Why ? Well , aging has to do with the pituitary gland , right ? Which can be accessed through the back of the neck . Did you suddenly become a scientist when I was in the hospital ? You trying to take my job ? It was an old case that I worked before I joined Fringe Division . This guy was draining hormones from pituitary glands . Anyway , my point is that ... some of the victims mentioned there were two suspects , one old and one young . but they all said that they never saw the suspects at the same time . Okay . Well , what if there weren 't two people ? What if there was only one person who was literally changing ... from old to young ? What if the Candy Man is stealing youth ? Okay . In theory , concentrated pituitary hormones could be processed in some way to accelerate healing , maybe even reverse aging , but , if that 's true , it would also cause some serious side effects . - Like what ? - Anemia , tremors , hypoglycemia . High blood sugar ? High enough that he could secrete sugar in his sweat ? This is Dunham . Okay , I 'll be there . Thank you . What was that about ? It 's nice to see you again , Olivia . Chris is looking forward to meeting you . Here we are . Chris , Agent Dunham 's here . Oh , " Olivia " is fine . It 's nice to meet you , Chris . Hi . Hi . Did you really save that school bus of kids from a Class-Three Vortex last year ? Is it true ? Well , I was just doing my job . Oh. that 's so cool So ... my mom says you want to talk about the man who took me . Yeah . Would that be okay ? Sure . Maybe we could talk somewhere else . Like , where is your favorite place to go ? Broyles . The Candy Man has had the boy for thirty-six hours . Twelve hours left . How are we doing ? Nothing yet , but we 're working every lead we have . You 'll be happy to hear that you 'll have your team back together soon . Our Olivia 's mission on the other side is almost complete , and we 'll be able to bring her home . And what about this Olivia ? We 're going to pull her out of the field tomorrow morning . I don 't believe we 'll be needing her anymore . Call me if you find anything . My dad says I need to forget about what happened . Yeah ? But it 's hard to forget , isn 't it ? You know , I can imagine what it must have been like for you ... how scared you must have been , how much you ... you really wanted to get back to your family , and to your friends . I have nightmares about this sometimes . Really ? Could you tell me about them ? I always remember ... the smell first . It 's musty , like our attic . He comes to the room wearing a mask to check on that thing stuck in my neck . It feels like ... it 's stealing my energy . I 'm so tired . I feel sick . Chris , you said that there were two men ... one old and one young , right ? Did they ever talk to you ? No . Nothing I remember . Chris . What is it ? You can tell me . I know the Candy Man 's back . Yeah , he is . He said if I told anyone about him , he 'd come back . He said this time ... he 'd hurt my mom and dad . That is not going to happen . I promise . Christopher , there is another little boy just like you . He 's been taken , and he wants to go home and see his family too . You can help him . I remember their voices . Um , they both said the same thing . I think it was a prayer . Can you remember the words ? Some of the words . " Through the pitch dark ... comes a cleansing fire . " Okay . ... " through the pitch dark comes a cleansing fire . " The words " pitch " and " dark " are common to several sacramental prayers from the early 20th Century . Uh , the words appear in the liturgy of over a dozen churches in New York City . A dozen that we know of . Every time there 's another Fringe event , a new church pops up . You know , I thought it was bad enough someone 's kidnapping kids . Now we find out he 's kidnapping kids for God ? - Hi , Honey . - Mom ! I collected some shells for you . They smell like the ocean . Thank you . Oh , looks like you brought half the beach back with you too . No , leave the sand . I like it . I 'll be right in . Broyles . He was very , very helpful . Thank you . - Thank you . - Come on . I want to wash the shells off . Okay . - Bye , Christopher . - Bye . - Dunham . - The boat 's called Sally . The Red Hook Marina in Brooklyn " B " Dock . Be there tonight at 10 : 00 , and I 'll get you where you want to go . - Okay , I 'll be there . - Dunham Charlie got a hit on the prayer . They traced it to the Astoria Church in Queens . QUEENS , NEW YORK ... " through the pitch dark comes the cleansing fire . " Yeah . " and through the fire , you shall find the spring of new life . " It 's beautiful , isn 't it ? What does it mean ? I wasn 't always a man of the cloth . You know , I used to be a physician . And then the Avian Influenza Epidemic came . My wife became ill . And despite all my training , there was ... there was nothing I could do to save her . Without her ... I was nothing . I was lost . But then God came and lifted me up , and he showed me that ... what people need in these troubled times is ... something to believe in . Faith . that 's what 'll heal this wounded world . The prayer was spoken by the suspect in a kidnapping that we 're investigating . We believe the suspect is a member of your church . It will help our investigation if you would give us the names and addresses of all the men in your congregation . Giving out information on parishioners is breaking the confessional seal . Reverend Marcus , I understand . I too am a man of faith . But right now there 's a child missing . And we need your help . We have a former victim who can identify the kidnappers ' voices . - And you believe that this person is reliable ? - He 's my son . Oh , I 'm sorry . I can get you the roster from our Men 's Group , if that 'll help . Thank you . There are over forty names on this list . We 'll have to split up . Call Lincoln and Charlie . No , nothing yet ... although this church is full of true believers . One guy actually told me that the reverend cured his kidney disease . So what about Charlie and Lincoln ? They 've interviewed seven men on the list , and none of them fit the profile . Okay , I 'm here . I 'll call you in a bit . Wyatt Toomy ? Agent Dunham . I 'm with Fringe Division . I need to ask you a couple questions in regard to an investigation . Can I come in ? Sure . Yeah ... Saw him on the news . It 's real sad . You really think someone from the church may have taken him ? Possibly . Yeah . Excuse me for a moment . So did you meet Reverend Marcus ? Yes . He is a miracle worker . Great man . Touched by God . Do you live here alone , Mister Toomy ? Yep . Just me . Don 't move ! This is Agent Dunham . I 'm at 1068 Kent Street , Apartment Five . The suspect 's been sighted . I need backup now , please . Max . Hi . I 'm with the F.B.I. Are you okay ? Okay ... Hey , You okay ? You sure ? Alright . Okay . Okay . The paramedics took Max to the hospital . His mother 's gonna meet him there . The super said that Wyatt Toomy had been living here for almost nine years . Kept to himself , always paid his rent a week in advance . Hey . You guys should take a look at this . Have you figured out what he was doing ? We won 't know exactly until we get this back to the lab ... but my guess is Olivia was right . About what ? Seems he was making some kind of age-regression serum . He was extracting hormones from the kids and giving them to himself . So your son was right . There was a young and an old suspect . It 's just they were the same man . This guy worked in sanitation . How 'd he figure out how to do all this ? Alright , let 's bag and tag it . I won 't forget what you did here . Hey . When you 're done here , you want to join me and Charlie for a beer ? We get a lot of bad days . We got to celebrate the good ones . No , thanks . I 'm going home . RED HOOK MARINA , BROOKLYN Hey . You 're nineteen minutes late . I had one more minute , and I was out of here . Wow , you really think this thing is gonna take us across the harbor ? Don 't worry about the boat . Worry about the patrols around that island . Hey , Henry , I know I 'm asking a lot of you , - If you want to back out ... - Come on . Let 's just get it over with , okay ? You want me to cast us off ? What ? Do you want me to untie the boat from the dock ? Oh , yeah , yeah . Do that . Yeah . Henry , you have done this before , right ? - Want to know the truth ? - Yeah . Water scares the hell out of me . Look , don 't worry . My cousin ran me through everything I need to know . We 'll be fine . Just do that ... that casting thing . What 's wrong ? Someone had to teach you how to do it . Yeah , so what ? I told you I 'm not a boater . Hey , Hon. When you hear this , give me a call . I shouldn 't be here too much longer . Hey , I just left you a message . Hey . I think we were wrong . Wyatt Toomy was not a scientist . He needed someone to show him how to make the serum . - Who ? - Reverend Marcus He said that he was a doctor . I think that 's how he 's been healing his congregation . He 's been dosing them . - Wyatt was working for him . - Dear God . Well , Christopher was right all along . There really were two suspects . I told Reverend Marcus Chris could I.D. the voices he heard , - and now my wife isn 't picking up the phone - Okay , I 'll meet you at your house . Henry , I gotta go do something . Can you promise me that you will wait for me ? Please ? Where the hell are you going ? You want to play hide-and-seek , young man ? I 'll find you . God wants me to find you . I 'm simply carrying out his plan . Take comfort , Christopher . You gave so much of yourself to help heal others . We all have to make sacrifices for the common good . No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! - No ! - Hey ! Let go of me ! Chris ! Dad . You 're safe , son . You 're okay now . REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER Where are you ? It 's been an hour . What 's the deal with you ? I 'm leaving now . Just give me 15 minutes . Make it fast . I 'm starting to get seasick . Agent Dunham ? - I thought that was you . - Missus Clayton , how is Max doing ? Doctors think you got there just in time . Now , he hasn 't been able to stop talking about you . It 'd really mean a lot if you could say hi . - Hey , Max , someone 's here to see you . - Hi . Hi . How are you feeling ? - Much better now . - That 's good . You 're a real brave kid , you know that ? Well , not as brave as you . Can I ask you a question ? Sure . What 's F.B.I. ? F.B.I. ? Where 'd you hear that ? Well , you said it when you saved me . Remember ? You said you were F.B.I. Oh . F.B.I. ' s just another word for police . Well , then when I grow up , I want to be F.B.I. too . That 'd be nice . Now , you should get some rest , because it 's late . Okay . - Bye . - Bye . How 's your wife and son ? They 're gonna be fine . In fact , the doctors are gonna take a look at the serum Wyatt Toomy was synthesizing It may have some healing potential for Christopher and the other victims . Well , that 's great . Maybe some good could come out of all this . Dunham ... The F.B.I. ceased to exist over a decade ago ... At least on this side it did . You know who you are , don 't you ? What happens now ? Now ... I 'm going home . Henry , Don 't worry . Just stick to the same bearings on your way out , And you won 't run into any of their patrols What makes you so sure ? 'cause I memorized the routes when I escaped from there . How you plan on getting up there ? I 'll manage . Thank you ... for everything . - Hey , I just borrowed a boat . - No . You believed in me . You got me all the way the hell out here ... You might as well tell me ... where is it you 're from ? I 'm from a parallel universe - Yes . - Sir . There 's been a security breach . Someone 's accessed the lab on Liberty island . Ma 'am , what are you ... we 're closed . I 'm sorry . I was just ... Would you be able to let me out ? No , no . Please , this can 't be happening . I 'm not gonna hurt you . I need you to listen very carefully . What I 'm gonna say is gonna sound insane , but I need you to do something for me . No ! No ! No ! Please ... . Please , I don 't belong here ! Sedate her . Oh , god ! Please let me go ! Who are you , really , and what were you before ? What did you do , and what did you think , huh ? We said , " No questions . " You know , I can turn it off if you want to go to sleep . I 'm just resting my eyes . Right . Otherwise known as sleeping . Oh , don 't you want to see how it ends ? I 've seen this movie about 100 times . You 're honestly telling me you 've never seen Casablanca ? I 've heard of it . It 's Ronald Reagan , right ? No . It 's Humphrey Bogart . I was kidding . Okay , so let me guess . They end up running away together , and they live happily ever after ? Actually , no . She leaves him at the airport , And they never see each other again . Oh . I thought you said it was a love story . Well , aren 't all the best love stories tragedies ? Only in the movies . Come on . Let 's go to sleep . - Good night . - Good night . Oh , you got to be kidding me . Hello ? Walter , is that you ? - I can hear you breathing . - Is this Peter Bishop ? Yes . I 'm calling from New York . I know this is gonna sound crazy , But I just saw a woman disappear in front of my eyes . Who is this ? Her name was Olivia . She has a message for you . She 's trapped in the other universe .

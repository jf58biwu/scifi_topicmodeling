 - What brings you out here ? - I 'm looking for my daughter . Previously on Touch ... What 's your daughter 's name ? Amelia . It 's called BreakWire . It 's a web-based , user-generated news organization . I had a gift to see how things all fit together . I share the same gift . It 's how I found you . This right here that I 'm working on is a God sequence . I 'm talking the evolution of the entire human species . And I 'm not just going to give it up to them for some mindless profit . I can 't do that . Not this time . Money is what you need . And money is what I have . A lot of it . She 's here . My baby 's here . Heard you went to the beach this morning . I don 't like it here . I miss my parents . I want to go home . LUCY : Made you a bagel , Jake . You like bagels ? " Of course , I like bagels , Lucy , who doesn 't like bagels ? " MARTIN : Morning . Uh , good morning . Hey , buddy . Oh , he won 't eat that like that . H-He 's really particular about his bagel- - half of it needs to be toasted , cut into four pieces , two pieces buttered and two pieces plain . It 's ... Wow . He 's never done that before . Well , maybe he 's ... ready for something new . Aren 't we all ? Want some coffee ? Y-Yeah . I 'll get it . Mm . Hey , I 'm sorry for , uh , waking you up last night . You didn 't wake me up . No , yeah , I did . I-I saw your light go on . It 's just , I have this thing , whenever I 'm in a new place , I wake up disoriented , and , uh , I know the best thing for me when I panic is to go outside and ... look at the stars and figure out where I am . ( chuckles ) Sounds nice . For a panic attack . ( chuckles ) Truth is , you didn 't wake me up . I was already up . I-I heard you ... walk outside . I ... don 't sleep very well either . Well , you can join me anytime you like . You just have to bring some anti-panic party favors like scotch , some new yoga moves , - something ... - I appreciate it . Okay . I 'm off . What are those ? Oh . This is my morning . I 'm gonna start at the beach and paper my way - through the city . - Lucy , y-you can 't put those up . Aster Corps 's looking for Jake . I mean , hell , the police are looking for me and Jake . You can 't put flyers up telling people how to find us . My daughter is missing , Martin . I 'm gonna do whatever I can to find her , - and if that 's a problem for you then you should just ... - It 's not . It 's not a problem . Lucy , I 'm on your side here , I ... It is my responsibility to make sure Jake is safe . That 's all . I ... Sometimes I overreact , I guess . I 'm-I 'm sorry . Got it . Sorry . Honey on your bagel , that 's quite a step forward . ( alarm beeps ) What is it ? I set up a news alert on my laptop . Let me know when anything 's happening with Aster Corps . The very brain inside of each of us will become obsolete . Redundant . Aster Corps wants to make money off that . Driven by profits and corporate greed , it 's a dystopian nightmare in the making . They plan on using my algorithms to further their need ... This guy is railing against Aster Corps in front of their stockholders . He 's talking about algorithms . Imagine it . A single numerical sequence LUCY : " Single numerical sequence ... " What ? Removed ? ! Who would do that ? - Aster Corps . - Right . I 'm gonna go down to BreakWire . Maybe they got the whole thing . See if Trevor can help me find out who this guy is . Jake , come on , buddy . We gotta go . Your room is this way . Come on , sweetheart . I 've gotta get your bag . Five , zero , zero . Five ... Jake . Jake , please . Jake ! I think maybe he wants to go with me . - I-I 'm sorry , is that ... - No . That 's fine . Uh ... Would you really be cool if ... if he went with you ? No , I 'm good . We have a lot to talk about . Okay . Um ... why don 't you guys meet me at BreakWire as soon as you 're finished . Will do . Thank you . JAKE : For thousands of years , sailors have looked to the stars to understand where they are . As oceans move beneath them , they take comfort in the fixed mark of the North Star , while here , below , nothing ever stops moving . ( grunting ) Come on ! Get in the van ! Let 's go ! Let 's go , let 's go ! ( engine revs , tires screech ) JAKE : Mass attracts mass . Bodies moving toward each other in space will speed up as they get closer . MAN : Amelia . ( screams ) Amelia ! ( crying ) : I ... want ... out ... of ... here ! I want to go home ! This is your home . Amelia ... ( screams ) The gravitational pull between two bodies becomes stronger ... We have a problem . ... making convergence inevitable . This isn 't working . Results are no better in the house than they were in the lab . She knows the difference . Look , we need to go back to the original plan . JAKE : What we 're heading toward or what the outcome of the convergence will be is unknowable . â™ª Man continues to look to the stars for certainty . But the only real certainty is that every day we 're alive our destiny is getting closer and closer . Trevor . Oh , hey , Martin . Oh , it 's juice . I juice now . Good for you . Can we talk ? Of course . Let 's go over here . TREVOR : This is unbelievable . Calvin Norburg tanks their stock price with one speech . I need to talk to this guy . Yeah , you and every other journalist in the world . He doesn 't talk to the press under any circumstance . He 'll want to talk to me . We share the same enemy . Yeah , Martin . At what point are you gonna tell me why Aster Corps is after you and vice versa ? They 're not after me . They 're after my son . Lucy 's daughter Amelia and my son Jake- - they 're the same . They have a gift- - they can see things in numbers and patterns . To be honest with you , I-I don 't really understand it . But obviously Aster Corps does and they see a value in it . They kidnapped Amelia and faked her death . When Ruben found that death certificate in their files with Jake 's name on it , that 's when I realized that 's what they were gonna do to Jake , but they couldn 't because I took him and ran . We 've been investigating Aster Corps abroad for some time now- - their business practices , murder and everything else down the line but ... didn 't think they 'd try it here . Right now the only way that I can prove that Aster Corps is doing this is to find Amelia alive . I figured since ... Calvin Norburg had turned against them that maybe he could help me . I 'm telling you , you 're not gonna get to him . But ... you may ... get to someone close to him . There . MARTIN : Five , zero , zero . - What ? - Jake 's number . Earlier this morning , Jake showed me a number , five , zero , zero . Who is this guy ? Uh , uh , Vikash Nayar . He 's been all over the wire this morning . One of the top five venture capitalists in the world . Huge risk taker ; known for backing unconventional entrepreneurs . What 's his connection to Norburg ? Business partner . As of ... this moment . If everyone thought Calvin Norburg had lost his mind , Vikash Nayar saw an opportunity and seized it . He 's the one guy Calvin Norburg 's talking to . How do I find him ? I 'll make some calls , find out where he 's staying . Thank you . The things we 'll accomplish together , my friend- - breakthroughs in the Third World , vertical farming , water delivery systems ... Thanks to you and your generous investment . Which Aster Corps are trying very hard to talk me out of . Oh , they 've contacted you ? Numerous ways and numerous times . They 've made it clear that investing in you is gonna be bad for my financial health . And you said ? Nothing . I refused to meet with them . I sent word through my lawyers that ... I 've made my decision and you will have the money soon . I believe in you , Calvin . In your vision . I 'd like to meet with my bankers before I fly to Spain . When do you leave ? This evening . I 'm due at the unveiling of my latest construction project- - a cathedral in Barcelona . So , uh , this afternoon ? Lunch , maybe ? ( phone ringing ) I 'd like that . Excuse me one moment . Who is this ? I understand . Everything okay ? I have ... I must go . What about lunch ? It 'll have to wait . I 'll be in touch . Is everything all right , sir ? - I have to go take care of something . - I 'll have the driver bring the car around . - No , I 'm going to go on my own . - I can 't let you do that , sir . You work for me , and you are dismissed for the day . Yes , sir . Follow him . Right now , I got a lot of limos coming and going , but no sign of Vikash Nayar . You got a room number on him yet ? There 's a Presidential Suite on the seventh floor , but so far , no confirmation that he 's in it . Okay . ( valet blows whistle ) MARTIN : Hold on . I got him . - Excuse me , but this is my cab . - No , it isn 't . - Yes , it is , and I don 't have time for this . - Sir , I need this taxi . - I can send for another car . Take couple of minutes . - No ! - No ! - I have to be downtown in 15 minutes . - Fine . I need to be downtown , too . Why don 't we just share the cab , so neither of us will be late ? Fine , but let 's just go . The corner of Fifth and San Pedro . That 'll work for me . ( indistinct conversations , lively music playing ) Rosemary Mathis ? _ _ Then we shall speak in English . Bless you . Have we met ? No , no . I 'm simply a fan . The concert hall you have designed for the Berlin Opera brought me to my knees , and I believe with this cathedral , you have reached perfection . That 's a lovely thing to say . Thank you very much . I hope I 'm not embarrassing you . No ... no , I , um ... I must learn to take a compliment , I 'm told . Then let me be the one to help you . I love your use of chiaroscuro . I mean , the contrast between illumination and blackness- - it 's ... tragic . - Tragic ? - Yes . Reminds us how far away we are from God . His light . Yes , it is tragic . And yet loving . These shafts of light cascading onto the parishioners- - it 's like you 're invoking the Nativity . The star of Bethlehem bathing the common man . Yes . You show such compassion . And yet ... I wonder . What ? You can say it . It 's all ... it 's all right . Are you trying to deliver us into the light , or are you using the shadows to hide ? I mean , is there something you do not want the world to know ? Rosemary , I need you . The London Times is doing a piece . Yes . Please excuse me . ( whispering ) Will you stay ? Yes , of course . ( gasps quietly ) ALL : Surprise ! ( whoops ) ( laughter ) MAN : Hold it up . If you 'd have given us a little more notice , we could 've done better than a grocery store cake and a banner from our dot matrix printer . I didn 't expect anything like this . Thank you . Really . Uh , we need plates . Ava , plates . You never said anything about retiring before . Sometimes these things just come over you in a flash . It 's time to make a change . - Like what ? - Oh ... - I don 't know . Travel . - Where ? - Paris . - Paris ! - Oh ! - Paris ! Oh ! I 've always wanted to go to Paris . I have , too . Well , we are really gonna miss you around here . When you get back from your trip , please come by and show us your pictures . We 'll set up a slide show in the AV room . Thank you , Louise . ( people sighing ) Thank you , everybody . This is so sweet . ( chatter and laughter ) ( seagulls screeching ) ( calliope music playing ) All right . Good spot . Okay , where else ? How about that fence over there ? People see it as soon as they get off the Scrambler . What ? Wait . We have no more ? We went through the entire stack ? We 're just gonna have to make some more . But first , how about some ice cream , yeah ? You like ice cream ? Come on . " I like ice cream , Lucy . Who doesn 't like ice cream ? " What 's your favorite flavor ? I like , the like , strawberry cheesecake kind ... GIRL : Hey ! Hey , kid ! Kid , kid , kid , you 've got to come with me on the Scrambler . - It 's really super fun , but you can 't go alone . - Soleil ? - And my mom gets so dizzy . It 's right there . - Soleil , you cannot run away from me like that ! - Hi . - Hi . Beth Friedman . I see you have already met my daughter . My name 's Soleil , like the sun , but in French . Wow ! Bonjour , Soleil . I 'm Lucy , this is Jake . BOTH : - Hi , Jake ! - He 's not much of a talker , but he 's very cool . Oh , don 't worry . She will talk enough for the both of them . Come on , Jake , let 's go on the Scrambler . - Please ? Please ? It 's right there ! - You can go if you want . Yay ! Yay ! This is gonna be the best . Look , I 'm sorry about the mix-up earlier . I just couldn 't afford to be late for this meeting . It 's fine . I recognize you . - Have we met before ? M-Martin Bishop . - I sincerely doubt it . That 's what it is . I recognize you . You were at the Aster Corps shareholder meeting . What did you make of Calvin Norburg 's meltdown ? What do you think set him off ? You 're a reporter . I should have known . That ploy with the cab . ( laughing ) : I 'm not a reporter . Yeah , right . Okay , fine . I am a reporter . And I 'm working on a story accusing Aster Corps of criminal activity , starting with and not limited to attempted murder , kidnapping , false imprisonment , and the faking of a death of at least one child . How much further ? - Almost there . - Look , unless you want to be linked to this story , you 're gonna have to talk to me , and I need you to put me - in contact with Calvin Norburg . - Let me out up there . Please , these people are dangerous- - do you understand ? I need you to put me in touch with Calvin Norburg ! Damn it ! Yeah , I followed him downtown . He 's headed into some alley . I 'm not sure what 's going on but I 'm staying on him . Just-just stay right where you are . Don 't move . ( vehicle approaching ) Mr. Nayar , do you have my money ? Where 's my father ? Show him his father . Mr. Nayar ? Don 't go any further , please . Get down ! Don 't slow down . They shot my bodyguard ! Go ! Go ! Drive ! Drive ! ( tires squealing ) - Are you all right ? Have you been hit ? - No . - Give me your cell phone . - What ? Your cell phone ! They can track it ! - We got to go back ! They 're gonna kill him . - Who ? - My father . - Why ? It 's kidnapping . They said they had him , - and they wanted $ 100,000 in cash . - Listen to me . They don 't want your father or your $ 100,000 . They 're trying to kill you , and they used your father as bait . Take this to the 10 , get off on Robertson . - Where are we going ? - Somewhere safe till we can figure this out . Damn it ! ( squealing , laughing ) BETH : It 's going so fast , I can 't believe it . Hey ! You know , well , we had this really wonderful relationship . We met 15 years ago . It was love at first sight . So , you know , we really tried to work it out . Don 't step on the crack , or you 'll break your mom 's back . We were in therapy , going back and forth , and it probably wasn 't , you know , worth it . - Seriously , don 't step on it . - So , anyway , he stayed in San Francisco . We came back here to live with my father in Mar Vista . House I grew up in . Trippy . I mean , where do the years go , right ? Uh , look at them . My goodness . She had really taken to your son . You are so lucky you have a boy . They are so much easier than girls , so I hear . Are they ? Well , I guess you wouldn 't know unless you have a daughter to compare . Do you ? SOLEIL : Hey , Mommy ? Can we ride on the roller coaster ? Please ? Sure . It 's okay with me if it 's okay with Jake 's mom . Sure . Whatever he wants . Have fun . Hey ! Uh , hold on ! Coming ! ( classical music playing ) I 'd lost sight of you . I thought you had gone . No . It is possible for us to continue our conversation . I know a quiet bar down the street . I don 't know you . You understand . Yes . But we could have a drink here . Frances . You 're really leaving ? I have to . Is it someone else ? - It 's not someone else . - Oh , I can see it . You got the new laptop , the Facebook account . I should have known . I didn 't meet anyone , Carl , online or anywhere . Well , then , what is going on ? I 'm making some changes in my life , big changes . They will require all of my energy and my focus . There just won 't be time for anything else . It 's really as simple as that . Paris- - Paris was supposed to be about us . - I 'm not going to Paris . - I heard you tell Louise ... - I had to say something . - Well , then , what is going on ? Where are you going ? I can 't really talk about it , but I have to go underground for a while , and no one can know where I am . - Not even me ? - Especially you . I don 't want you getting involved in this . I couldn 't live with myself if you got hurt . I 'm hurting right now . I am so sorry , Carl . I don 't have a choice . This is your idea of a safe harbor ? There 's cameras all over the building . These people are my friends . They 'll help us figure out what we need to do . Martin , I ... Mr. Nayar . Uh , Trevor Wilcox . - Wow , you 're good . - We need somewhere to talk . This way . You can power your phone back up . This place has a cell signal block . Now , why would Aster Corps do this ? I was a major shareholder of theirs because I believed in Calvin Norburg . When he left , I left . I took my money out of Aster Corps - so I can give it to him . - I 'm sure they 're not too happy about that . Their lawyers were relentless , but I refused to meet with them . I was scheduled to transfer the money today , but ... But they kidnapped your father . I didn 't even know anyone knew about my father . We 've been estranged for years . My mother 's dying wish was that I reconcile with him , but he lives on the street . He does these crazy sculptures . And I didn 't try very hard to find him , and now my money is going to get him killed . Excuse me just for one second , please . What 's happening ? The man in the conference room is Vikash Nayar . Jake 's number led me to him . His father was kidnapped ; I think Aster Corps is behind it because he was trying to help Calvin Norburg . So they kidnapped his father like they kidnapped Amelia . - That means he can help us ; this is good . - Yes , yes , I know , but we have to do this in stages . Right now we have to help him find his father . What ? He knows Calvin . We need Calvin in order to find Amelia , so I 'm going to speak to him . Lucy , please just , just calm down , okay ? I don 't want to calm down . ( Jake hyperventilating ) Jake , Jake , sweetheart , it 's all right . We were just talking , okay ? Jake ... I 'm sorry . I 'm done talking . I 'm sorry . - MARTIN : Lucy . - I 'm sorry , Jake . MARTIN : Lucy , please . Jake , Jake ... Please just stay here . Lucy ! Lucy ! Lucy ! Lucy ! Where are you going ? ( turns engine off ) I don 't know . ( scoffs ) Really , I was just wondering the same thing . I was about to pull out and I thought , " I havenowhere else to go . " Do you know what I mean ? I ... have all this stuff and I don 't know where to put it , so I just want to find my daughter , and I can 't do anything , but I want to do something . I know , I know . Listen to me . Right now the best chance we have to find Calvin Norburg is sitting in that conference room . So ... so why don 't we just take a breath here , okay ? And then go back inside and try and figure this thing out ? I need to find my daughter . I can 't sleep . I can 't do anything . I can barely walk . - I can barely get out of bed . - Look , look , look at me . How long have you been looking for your daughter ? Three years . Look at how much closer we 've gotten in just two days . I need you to trust me . I need you to believe that I 'm gonna do everything I can to help you find your daughter . I promise . I 'm sorry , I 've ... I 've got to go back inside and get Jake . Come on . Just , I 'll be a minute , okay ? Thanks . Okay . I 'll see you inside . Okay . In the Cathedral of Toledo , there is a hidden skylight , so high up that only those who seek the source ever see what 's truly there . And what 's there ? A portal to Heaven . How is that not blasphemy ? How is it ? When man aspires to the level of God , he offends God , and offending God means death . I believe in a more compassionate deity , one who welcomes us into Heaven . We are always closer to Heaven than we realize . Tell me the story . Of what ? Your scar . It was a deep wound . It 's a painful memory ... and shameful . Shameful ? Because it involves a woman . Did you deserve it ? Yes . I hurt her ... and I regret it deeply . Then the scar serves its purpose . To remind you the pain we inflict on others ... remains our own . I 'm sorry . It 's ... late . Walk me to my flat ? Vikash Nayar is gone , disappeared . What are you talking about ? Where 'd he go ? He got a phone call a couple minutes ago , went down the hall to take it . Next thing I know , he was gone . The kidnappers must have gotten to him . Why would he listen to the kidnappers ? Because he 's desperate and he thinks he can save his father . They 'll kill both of ' em . I 'll call the hotel , see if they have a contact number - for him . - Okay , I 'll see if I can track down his ... Where the ... ? Jake , did you take my cell phone ? Trevor , has your phone got GPS tracking ? - Yeah . - Let me see it . I got him . He 's heading eastbound on the 10 . You 're a good boy , Jake . LUCY : Okay , heading east on Olympic . MARTIN : You get a senseof how fast they 're going ? No , all I 'm getting is a ... a steady blinking dot . W-W-Wait , south on Fig ... - F-Figueroa . - Figueroa . How far ahead of us are they ? I-I don 't know , it 's hard to tell . Not that far . Hold on . Don 't do this , Frances . Don 't cut me out of your life . You are making this so much harder . It should be hard . It should be impossible . It is . ( sighs ) I can 't tell you what I 'm doing or why . This is my new phone number . Please don 't tell anyone . ( sighs ) This is it . Thank you for walking me home . I could have walked with you forever . ( gentle laugh ) Why have I never met you before ? ( chuckles ) Things happen when they must . So we were destined to meet ? ( both chuckle ) What else are we destined for ? You , for greatness . Please don 't . It 's true . It 's a burden and a lie . What do you mean ? The designs aren 't mine . They come to me fully formed . There is no thought , no artistry , no pleasure . I see patterns and calculations and I write them down . You are the chosen vessel . They come through you . It 's your destiny . Must I fulfill my destiny ? Can I choose a different path ? Why would you ? To be normal . To be happy . To feel loved . I would give up everything for that . ( exhales ) Wouldn 't you ? We shall see . I 'm sorry . What for ? The answer is no . No ? We cannot choose a different path . We must fulfill our destiny . There they are . What are they doing ? VIKASH : Hey , he 's not well . Not my problem . - Is that a gun ? - I got an idea . Let me see your phone . All I have to do is pick a target in the photograph and I can enlarge it over a hundred times . Tell your bosses I will cancel the deal with Calvin Norburg ... ( pained grunting ) ... or I 'll pay you whatever you want . Just let us go . SANJAY : Please , please . Don 't hurt my son . VIKASH : I 'm so sorry , Father . ( panting ) It 's almost time . My sculpture , it will be revealed . Please ! ( phone ringing ) What is that ? Who knows you 're here ? Give me that . No , that 's not my phone . That 's not my phone . What is this ? Oh , man , that 's us . _ Somebody 's watching us . ( phone ringing ) Who is this ? The photographs that I just sent you , I 've also sent to the police . I figure you 've got four to seven minutes . Look , I know you 're just doing this for the money . Don 't be stupid . Get out of there now . All you have to do is leave the two men behind and walk away . I said walk away , now ! I said walk away , now ! Let 's go . Come on , let 's go . MARTIN : They 're moving , let 's go . ( tires screeching ) ( grunts ) ( both gasping ) ( Vikash sobbing ) ( tires squealing ) You made this happen . How can I ever repay you ? - Right now I 'm just grateful that you and your father are okay . - Are you all right ? Look , I am absolutely positive that Aster Corps was behind this , but I can 't prove it ; at least not now . So you 're going to have to tighten up your own security until you can get your funds transferred out of the company . I 'm going to give you my number in case Calvin Norburg wants to talk to me . If he does , I would be grateful . ( tearing paper from pad ) - I 'm Lucy . - Yes . ( bell tolling ) She will be here soon . Who ? ( tolling continues ) LUCY : Oh , my . ( laughs softly ) That 's Amelia . My daughter . How did you do that ? You have lost your child ? Yeah . You will find her . The police are going to be here in about 15 minutes . I can 't be here . Good luck . Lucy , we need to go . Amelia . I 'm sorry , but we 've got to go now . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . JAKE : We are all in motion , hurtling toward a destinywe did not choose and cannot avoid . Hi , Amelia . My name 's Frances . I 'm going to take care of you from now on . Just me , no one else . I know you 've been lonely . I know you miss your mother . I 'm sorry she left you . I 'm a mother . And it breaks my heart to see a child so all alone . I 'm alone , too . We can keep each other company . Maybe we 'll go to the beach tomorrow . You love the beach , don 't you ? I like the tides . I brought you a book on tides . LUCY : So what do you think our chances are of getting a meeting with Calvin Norburg ? I don 't know , but I 'm not getting my hopes up . Huh . Uh , that is a skill I have not yet mastered . ( laughs ) ( children laughing , shouting happily ) Jake ? ! LUCY : Hey , Jake ? ! - Jake ? - What 's he doing ? Jake , stop now ! Don 't you ever do that again . Do you understand me ? It 's dangerous . Hey . Hey , what is it ? Jake , hey ! Hey , this is my school . Do you go to school here , too ? Want to play basketball ? LUCY : Look who it is . Soleil . Like the sun . This is Martin , Jake 's dad . We met her at the pier today . - Hi . - Hi . Who ? Come on , Jake ! Let 's go ! Go . Go . What the hell is happening ? JAKE : Bodies moving through space speed up as they get nearer to one another . The convergence is inevitable . SOLEIL : Come meet my grandpa ! Grandpa ! Grandpa ! - Hi . - Hi , honey . This is my friend Jake . CARL : Hey , Jake . I 'm Carl . SOLEIL : Let 's go play ! Come on ! Oh , forget it . JAKE : For thousands of years , sailors have looked to the stars to understand where they are . As oceans move beneath them , they take comfort in the fixed mark of the North Star . But here , below , nothing ever stops moving . ( phone ringing ) _ Hello ? MAN : - Martin Bishop ? - Who is this ? Calvin Norburg . I understand you want to speak with me about Aster Corps . - Yes , very much . - I 'll be in touch . W-Wait . Hello ? Hey . You can 't sleep , either , huh ? No . Did you figure out where we are yet ? Closer .

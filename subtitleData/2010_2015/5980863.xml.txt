 KIERA : Previously on Continuum ... No freaking way . Argh ! Where are you taking him ? You already know . The revolution starts here . Liber8 wouldn 't exist if it weren 't for me . Perhaps they 're nothing more than a manifestation of my conscience . I knew it ! ( GRUNTS ) ( LAUGHING ) He 's the one that killed me . You 're not fit to lead this cell . Luckily , not your call . KIERA : This is a disaster . What happens now ? KATHERINE : He 'll be debriefed . Will Alec be debriefed ? If he won 't reveal where he buried the time-travel weapon , yes . I don 't like it . CURTIS : What a surprise . Kiera Cameron unsure . Protector . That 's a terrible name for you . Who do you protect , Kiera ? Not Alec . Not your family . You slept-walked through your life in 2077 . And then a miracle . You 're shown the fabric of everything . And , yet , still asleep . Even in a cage , I 'm freer than you 'll ever be . What have I done ? KIERA : Jaworski ! ( GRUNTING ) Ahhh ! Armor piercing . ( GUN CLICKING ) Ripped By mstoll Shit ! ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( RAPID BEEPING ) ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ) You asshole ! Patrol Tango Seven Five Niner . We 're heading back with the prisoner . Arresting Officer Cameron on board . Dispatch a CS unit to Oxbow mine . Uploading coordinates . One of ours and a bounty hunter . No medical , two body bags . DISPATCH : Roger that . 10-4 . What does that make now ? 25 ? 30 ? Loose lips feed CPS chips . Suit yourself . ( ALARMS BEEPING ) COMPUTER : Warning ! Warning ! Warning ! What have we got ? Temp 's spiking . I may have to sit her down . What ? Control ! Tango Seven Five Niner . We have had a complete systems malfunction . We are going down . Over . I can 't hold ii . Hold on ! Brace for impact . Imp ... What ? Hold on ! No ! ( PANTING ) On your knees ! Take a beat , Protector . You 're alive . I said ... On your knees . It 's dirty . Down ! Ahhh ! Ahhh ! ( CHUCKLES ) ( GASPS ) ( CMR SCREECHING ) They don 't make CMRs like they used to , do they , Protector ? Do you ever stop talking ? ( SIGHS ) Would you mind pulling this hunk of fascist gun ship out of my leg ? ( GROANS ) How 's that ? ( GRUNTING ) I might have nerve damage . I 'm sure I 'll get over it . How much they pay you guys now ? Not a lot . They have to save capital for the no-bid contracts on the never-fail gear , like this death trap . I swear , if my gun was working , I 'd shoot myself just to avoid hearing any more of this . You know , bit currency 's still around . You can buy anything you want on the black market . Who 's going to question it if , say , you blacked out in the crash , came to , and I was long gone ? You really think that 's a play ? In my experience ' yeah . Most of the time . Well , I 'm not in this for the money . One more nihilist lunatic off the streets . That 's reason enough for me . You talk like that even when CPS isn 't listening ? Wow ! Nihilist ? ( CHUCKLES ) You don 't know the first thing about us . Anti-Corporate Congress . Anti-social archaic rhetoric handed down by Theseus . Another lunatic . I know what any citizen needs to know about you . It 's either you or us . ( CMR SCREECHING ) ( GROANS ) We walk two-three klicks that way , we 'll be overlooking the Mamquam . Then we 'll follow the riverbank straight to Squamish . We avoid the exclusion zones . No . We wait . They 're not coming , Cameron . I know a busted emergency beacon when I see one . They 've already taken the write-down on that flyer . Probably you , too . JADEN : Stay where you are ! I 'm CPS . This man is my prisoner . She 's lying . Both of you , shut it . Like Hold you , I 'm CPS . I am responsible for this man . I don 't care who you are . You 're coming with us . NATHAN : Wait . If she is CPS , doesn 't she have one of those ... It 's not working . You 're clear . What are you doing ? Building goodwill . JADEN : Let 's move . Told you it was that way . PANGEA : You might have given us a heads-up . They 're not the first guests to cross our threshold . He 's different . This is not for the ears of outsiders . Excuse me . Are you in charge here ? This man is wanted on charges of murder and terrorism . Turn him back over to me and that 's the end of it . I couldn 't care less about an illegal grow-op . Is that what you think we do ? Drugs ? They 're gleaners , Protector . You and I are not so different . Resisting the overreach of the Global Corporate Congress . You eke out a living as free men , and women . The kind of people you blow up . She has a head plant on . We can 't antagonize ... JADEN : He says it 's not functional . Let 's look at it and have the doctor install a governor . SONYA : They said your CMR wasn 't working , but just in case , the governor creates a null field . You won 't be able to receive , record or transmit . How is ii for migraines ? Sorry , no help there . What if I take it out ? Well , it 's hooked directly into your cerebellum , so if I had to guess , I 'd say you 'd lose speech and motor control ... Watch my finger . ... and most of your childhood . So , seriously , I 'd leave it right where it is . So much for " First do no harm . " Well , I help those who help themselves . Why the mask ? You 're not exactly a country doctor . Why are you here ? Let 's call it penance . You know what I think ? I think you 're wearing the mask so that I can 't identify you later . You know , you can spare me the good citizen speech . These people live an honest life . There 's nobility in that . She 's done . Mr. Cameron . I 'm Leon Rutledge . I have items for you to sign . Um ... All right , um ... You 're from ? Corporate responsibility . This won 't take a moment . First of all , 80 % of your life debt and that of your child will be waived . There 's also a substantial settlement . SadTech has also processed a pay grade revision , a promotion . It 's all explained in these documents . You absolve SadTech and assigns from all responsibility from the failure of the SadTech heavy flyer . Wait . Is this about Kiera ? I 've been trying to reach her . Protocol hasn 't contacted you ? About what ? Mr. Cameron , CPS Protector Kiera Cameron was declared inactive at 2240 hours . Her CMR is off-grid . Investigation was thorough and complete . Pilot error . No salvageable material . SadTech has taken the write-down . The case is closed . Are you telling me my wife is dead ? I 'm an actuary , sir . I 'm not authorized to have this conversation . I 'd like you to go now . Yeah , there 's still the matter of the ... Mmm . This is good contraband , Protector . You taste that ? The system is based on an efficient division of resources . What works for 30 people , can 't work for millions . When I was young , family farming wasn 't a crime . And then they mandated genetically enhanced seeds . And the crops produced no seeds . We had to buy fresh seeds every year , and they 'd only grow with their pesticide . Their fertilizer . That 's when you went gray . We were one of the first gleaner communities . They tolerate us now because we 're small . And we keep quiet . No pushback . No stockpile of guns . We just want to be left alone . ( SONYA GROANS ) ( SIGHS ) KAGAME : So ... I hear we have visitors . SONYA : You should be sleeping . Mariah brought me soup . It was delicious . But I have questions . Where 's your mask ? I think we both know that you 're not contagious . Unless gunshots wounds spread differently than I recall . I have relied on an old debt for far too long . As long as I am here , these people are in danger . This inspector came by our farm , said we hadn 't registered . My dad stood his ground . They shot him dead . My mother only lasted a week . I am so sorry . She 's so sorry . I 'm sure that 's the apology you 've been waiting for , kid . You see , everyone ? The system works . You are no better than the people that killed this boy 's family . That 's enough . Pangea . Tie them up when they 're done . We need to talk . Tell me , did you finish the book ? It 's ... It 's eye-opening . It 's just it 's so different than ... Than what you were taught ? Yes . The truth has a way of getting repressed . Tell me . How do you think the gleaners would be faring if Theseus had prevailed ? They get by fine . Always on the edge , though . Always aware that with one swoop , the boot will descend . Is that truly free ? I 'm not that easy to manipulate , Edouard . I 'm not that lost . No , you are not . Tell me about this CPS officer . Like it or not , it 's in both our interests to cooperate . How do you figure ? I 'm worth the ransom . But there 's the matter of obstructing a CPS officer carrying out her duties . If they deal me back to Liber8 , well ... You 're a loose end ' then , aren 't you ? You 've been harboring the old man for weeks . He was a friend of this community from before the war . We owe him a debt of barter . JADEN : If this Jaworski is Liber8 , then there 's a price out on him . We could buy new combine parts . Not have to rebuild every cranky machine 10 and 20 times . We could grow . If we grow too big , we attract attention . They tolerate us because we 're small . We are not equals . There 's no doubt about that . Add to that , the kidnapping of a corporate policewoman . Jaden , what were you thinking ? It 's like you want them to come crashing in here . Just keep her out of the way until I can make a deal . ( SIGHS ) See how strident this protector is . How committed . If she doesn 't make waves , if she 'll go along ... And if she doesn 't ? We don 't have to commit to anything now . Revolutionaries didn 't take your parents , kid . People like her . What are you going to do about that ? Oh , you 'd like that , wouldn 't you ? Use me to get your revenge ? Revenge would be letting me do it . He preys on the weak-willed , but that 's not you . How stupid do you think I am ? Just squeeze the trigger . It 's done . And what makes you think I 'd leave a witness ? Just pull the trigger , kid . I can make you a rich man . SONYA : Nathan ! Put the crossbow down . ( CMR SCREECHES ) Oh , Jaworski . When we get out of here , I am going to make you pay . Come on , Cameron . They know you 'll sell them out to the corporation the first chance you get . You 're not walking out of here . Best make your peace with that . I 'm finding it hard to see . Can we slow down ? You 'll manage . Keep moving . Don 't say anything . Stay quiet if you know what 's good for you . They 're from the city . Quiet . Why do you think they 're here ? This is an illegal settlement . And you 're a CPS protector . Do you honestly think they 'd be pleased to see you here ? Talk about a bad career move . What are they doing ? Can 't you guess ? As soon as they 're clear , we 'll go up top . STEFAN : Business good ? Why wouldn 't it be ? Taste hasn 't been bred out yet . I bet they divvy up that pallet and half the food winds up on the tables of half the CEOs in Corporate Congress tonight . Is that true ? You trade with the very same people you despise . Isn 't that the definition of capitalism ? Don 't you see the irony ? Everywhere I look . SONYA : They may try to kill her . So ? She 's already asleep . Like all the good corporate sheep . You told me you fled the city because you got a job offer you couldn 't turn down and you couldn 't accept SadTec 's super soldier program . What you know about implants makes you uneasy . They nudge you . They change how you think . What you accept . You record instead of bear witness . Store up data , not remember feelings . It 's ... inhuman . But this protector , she made her choice . Yeah , but it wasn 't an informed choice . She chooses to serve a system that codifies monstrous inequity . That literally works lo strip away her humanity and her freedom . And Theseus would say that there are no inhumane choices in the last defense of humanity . I know . But you still can 't accept it . These gleaners , they 've been good to me , an ally . They choose to opt out of the system , but are forever at the mercy of that same system . Are they truly free ? Or are they just on a longer rope ? So , one chooses to serve the system , others attempt to bargain outside the system . ( SCOFFS ) I wonder if there 's a third choice . For someone like you . ALEC : It was the regular delivery ? BRENNER : The routing code was switched to send a specific box to you . Blood and saliva profile is confirmed . No synthesized DNA markers . It 's actual . Our gleaner friends have been busy . All actions are authorized . Maximum response . Yes , sir . Sit . Run it . ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) Protectors identity has been confirmed . Cameron , Kiera . She 's marked inactive . So , they 're not looking for you . Good . Aw ! You bummed her out . She still thought the cavalry was coming . Now you . All that computer 's going to tell you is what the corporation wants you to know . Run it . Ten most wanted . 50,000 bit currency or life credit . I have a counter-offer . Filomen 3872Delta / . And spell out band two , hopscotch and kanji . You 'll be communicating with a friend of mine . Tell him Jaworski says his sister is a giraffe . He says giraffes are extinct , and the offer is 1,000,000 bit currency . A million ? STEFAN : Cover your tracks . Go through any middleman you want . Do we have a deal ? KIERA : Jaden . Right now , you can walk away from everything you have done . But if you do this , your community breaks a truce . Both of you , outside . Watch them . What now ? I just want to check something . I knew Mariah was full of it . And I 'm the one putting the community in danger . How much you think he 's worth ? Mr. Sadler . We have a CPS flyer down in the vicinity of the target gleaner compound . Telemetry suggests they accessed the data of an Officer Cameron , the spouse of one of your executives . This would suggest she 's alive . Then continue with the mission as ordered . No one else should know of this . Understood . And the husband ? Leave that with me . Oh , it 's worse . It 's so much ... ( CMR SCREECHING ) lt 's so much worse ! ( GROANS ) Keep moving . Just wait a minute , okay ? I can 't see . Oh ! Are we gonna shake on our deal , gleaner ? You 're bartering and selling him . You 've kidnapped me . And you consider yourselves the more civilized ones ? Even hurtin ' , she 's a pistol . You gotta give her that . JADEN : Just keep moving . ( HIGH-PITCHED SCREECHING ) Where am I ? KAGAME : Infirmary . You have the good doctor quite worried . I find that hard to believe . She seems quite dedicated to her calling . Professional . She 's done wonders with this little enclave . Who are you ? Another unlucky traveler . Just coming out of the contagious stage , I 'm told . Lucky me . You 're a protector . Who are you protecting now ? Who are these people a threat to ? Well , they 're not too fond of me . Fond or not , they seem to care about your wellbeing . The doctor even changed my thinking . About what ? Blaming you . You 're conditioned to see the world in a certain way . Like a dog . I hope , one day you have a chance to look at things through different eyes . Make choices that are your own . ( CMR SCREECHING ) That 's the only way to take a person 's true measure . ( HIGH-PITCHED SCREECHING ) ( GROANS ) Push the button . You should be ready for another dose . Kiera . Pretty name . SONYA : Her implant was damaged . Removing the governor will be low-risk , and keeping it on might kill her . I don 't want her death on my hands . Do you , Mariah ? None of this will matter soon . Take it off . Thank you , Doctor . Let me go make the deal . If we save the protectors life , they 'll be grateful . Graciousness is not their primary virtue . It is if we 're offering them their number one most wanted . How 's that feel ? ( SIGHS ) The nausea is better . But I can 't ... It 's okay . Your visual field will clear in a couple of hours . I 'm going to give you some more sedatives so you can get some rest . No , please . I don 't ... I don 't need any . It 's okay . She 's out . We need to talk . You 've been quiet for a long time . Not acting like a man who 's about to get a big payday . Liber8 pays its debts . Could do a lot of good for you people . ( SNIFFS ) Or have I read this wrong ? Maybe you 've made other plans . What are you doing ? I fear I 'm being betrayed . Tell me if you think I 'm being paranoid . There 's something going on . ( SIGHS ) You won 't make it two kilometers . I could . With your help . I will take you as far as the ridge , but no further . Come on . I can ask no more . Jaworski . Where is he ? Jaden took him . There 's a trade coming . And not only for him . You 're in danger , too . I feel like we 've made a terrible mistake . Maybe I can help . PANGEA : Wait , please . How much of a head start did they get ? Not much . An hour , maybe . An hour and a half . ( GROANS ) ( VOMITING ) I 'm sorry . I ... Pangea , how far along are you ? I have a son . I barfed for nine weeks . The gleaner lifestyle was fine for me , but ... I don 't know . It 's okay . We 'll ... We 'll talk as we walk . The crossbow 's gone . So are the keys to the handcuffs . Your whatever-ibis isn 't working . You can 't call for help . We have no idea where Jaworski went . You 're supposed to be the resourceful one . Where do you ... ( SOFTLY ) No . How far are we from the Mamquam ? The river ? " Follow the bank to Squamish . " That 's what he said . Could you show me ? I 'm sorry , Pangea . You can 't help him now . All right . Okay . Okay . There we go . Need a break ? No . Okay . ( GASPS ) Oh , you are a better tracker than I gave you credit for , Protector . This is the end of the line , Jaworski . How do you figure ? It 's just you and me . I like my odds . You want to watch her die , try something . I wouldn 't . You 'll just get her killed . Your move , Protector . This is my move . ( GROANS ) Mr. Sadler . Hope I 'm not interrupting . Please , sit . I wanted to apologize for the terrible way you heard , and to express my condolences . Thank you . I 'm loyal to SadTech , sir , but this is a terribly odd thing to process . My fortunes have radically improved , but my life is ... The bonus credits ? Yes , they 're imperfect instruments , but it 's all we have . It 's not that . I value my job . But I love my wife . You have a son . I told him his mother 's on assignment until things are definitive . I raised my son as a single father . It 's not easy , but there are rewards . Mr. Sadler , I , um ... ( SIGHS ) Never mind . No . No , speak your mind . So few people do with me nowadays . It 's a life . It 's not a write-down or a settlement . It 's a life . We are the wealth that we create . In life , that means good works , productivity , offspring , goodwill . But ultimately , each of us is judged by what we leave behind . Some of that is measurable , but our valuations don 't capture everything . We let actuaries and balance sheets determine our worth . Even that word " worth , " it 's ... It 's not the right word . Well , well ... Shocked as hell to get a ping off your CMR , Cameron . Thought they 'd taken a write-down on you . Yeah , it 's completely frazzed . Yeah , we 'll get you sorted . I 've also got a civilian passenger . All right . We 'll get her sorted , too . We gotta clear the area , now . This is a hot zone . ALEC : If Kiera has paid the ultimate price for her loyalty to the corporation , it will not go unnoticed . I suppose I 'm looking for meaning in it all . Something to tell our son to help him understand . ALEC : The meaning is all around you . SadTech and the other members of the Corporate Congress , their sole purpose , to enrich the lives of all the citizens . To preserve the promise of a civil society . To never again slip into the chaos of the past . You tell your son his mother 's life , her sacrifice to the corporation , has enabled all of us left behind to prosper . Do you really believe that ? The answer to that question is the burden of an old man , one cursed to see 10 steps ahead . Oh , no . ( STAMMERING ) I have to go . They 'll be wounded ! They need help ! There 's nothing left . What ? What the corporation cannot own , it destroys . The gleaners brought this on themselves . Greed poisons . It punishes everyone . Oh , my God . Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Take what you 're feeling and put it towards something right . This is your place and your time . Follow your instincts to take a moral stand . I 'm not a revolutionary , Edouard . No . You 're a healer . And that 's something far more useful . You 're going to go back and take the super soldier job . A great day is coming , Sonya . And you will be on the inside . That is what you can do . That is your way . You do not serve or bargain . You will heal . You will heal us all . For them . STEFAN : For a while , you were thinking for yourself , Protector . Guess it 's back to sleep now . Enjoy your cage . Even in a cage , I 'm freer than you 'll ever be . KERR : He was right . KATHERINE : Who was ? Jaworski ? Kagame . He said I would see things through new eyes . Make choices of my own . Kagame wiped out that whole compound . Why ? I don 't know . But I do know he had his reasons . Each of us is judged by what we leave behind . Who said that ? Alec Sadler . Or he will say it . Why this particular memory , Kiera ? Jaworski said I was asleep . Curtis Chen said the same thing . I wouldn 't put stock in what Curtis says . There 's good in your future . You 're proof of that . There was something in Curtis' eyes , and I recognize it now . Jaworski had it . Kagame had it . Zealotry . Commitment . Are you saying you aren 't committed ? I 'm saying I 'm not asleep anymore . Thank you . I 'm going home . Somebody ! Help ! Somebody ! Help ! Help ! ( GRUNTING ) Shit !

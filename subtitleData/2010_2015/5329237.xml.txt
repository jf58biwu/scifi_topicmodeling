 Max ! Come on ! Don 't keep the Sisters waiting . This is Frey . She 's new here as well . Can you read ? It 's a giraffe . They were from Africa . - You can read ? - Yes . Max , have you been stealing things again ? It breaks my heart . Why do you do this ? So you can save up ? One day buy a ticket up to that place ? That place is not for you , or for me . But it 's not fair , Sister . Why can 't I go there ? Sometimes in life we don 't understand why things are the way they are . But I know one thing . I know you are special . You will do something very important one day . Something you were born for . My little Max . Off to work , huh ? Gotta get up early to work that line . Make the world a better place . I can finally buy my ticket to Elysium . All right . Leave me alone ! Your bags may be searched . Burn her ID ! What happened ? - The police . - You okay ? Don 't worry about it . The time is 5 : 50 a.m.

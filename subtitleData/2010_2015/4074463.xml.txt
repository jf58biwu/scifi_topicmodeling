 So If we can extrapolate from this map several possible locations for the book we could possibly set up a series of stakeouts or observation posts . Ahhhh . Cut it out ! Sorry , Jenny . But these daily , where will the book strike next meetings are boring . But check out this new game we invented . It 's called human ball . Ten points ! Ugh , enough ! I 'm sick of you idiots ! I 'm the only one here who 's taking any of this seriously ! You 're just here ' cause you 're crushing on Todd , you 're just here ' cause you 're crushing on me , and you 're just here - - Whoa , like period much ? WHAT ? Did somebody already do a joke about it being her time of the month ? Today 's the anniversary of her father 's disappearance . Oh , has it already been a year ? Leave it in the past , Atticus , leave it in the past . Ten points ! ♪ How many times do I have to tell you to stop touching me , Brit ? Sorry , Delilah . And stop calling me Delilah . It 's Dee , got it ? Delilah was a supporting character in a patriarchal bible story demonizing femininity . So , tell me what he did . What ? Did he give you german herpes ? Guys cck . No , it 's not a boyfriend thing . Oh , daddy issues . My favourite . Come on . Let 's go someplace private so you can tell Dee all about it . Subsfreak  And all I know is that it has something to do with this stupid Book of Pure Evil , and I 'm never gonna see him again . I 'm sorry , I don 't even know why I 'm telling you all this . Hey , it 's okay . Let it all out . Let Dee make you forget all your worries . Oh , Dee , um , I 've never been with another- - You never know ' til you try . Man , why do I always say the wrong thing to Jenny ? Looks like someone needs some advice from Dr. Curtis love . Dude , I don 't need love advice from you . This time I 'll wave my fee 'cause we 're best buds . If you 're gonna get with Jenny , you have to remember all the important dates in her life . Her birthday , Valentine 's Day , the day her dad mysteriously disappeared . Whoa , dude , how am I supposed to remember all of that ? Besides , even if I did , I still always say the wrong thing . It 's not what you say , just be there for her . You know , get in touch with your feminine side . Dude , I 'm still trying to get in touch with my masculine side . Ohhh ... Mmmm ... Now that 's , a feminine side . Hello ? Oh hi , it 's me Atticus , your loyal servant of Satan . You have not been summoned , why do you bother us ? Nice to talk to you too . Hey do remember that little job I did for the society last year ? Kidnapping that journalist ? Whatever happened to that guy ? It is not for you to know . It is for me to know as his daughter is starting to freak out about his disappearance again . Atticus , do not compromise your position as a member of their gang ! If she needs a father figure , be a father to her ! Do I have to spell out everything ? Oh , and uh , before you hang up , fuck you , you cock sucker , whore-porking piece of shit-fucker ! How does that spell out for you ? AHHHHHHHH ! Hey , what 's the emergency ? I know who has the book . It 's Delilah . She used the book to turn Jenny into a lesbian . What ? Curtis and I watched them make-out . For over an hour . You douches ! Show her your feminine side . Jenny , it 's okay . This isn 't your fault . It 's the book . We can cure you , before it 's too late . And just so you know , your birthday is May 17th . No , it isn 't . I have it on good authority that it is . You guys don 't even care about what I 'm going through . That 's just the book talking ! You sure you 're not just being jealous dude ? Why would the book turn Jenny into a lesbian ? Man , what the hell do you know ? You 're the dork-wad who told me to get in touch with my feminine side ! Sorry , Todd . I don 't think it 's the book either . Jenny 's looking for an authority figure to replace her dad without threatening his memory . Hence replacing him with an alpha-type female . What ? I th ink Hannah 's saying that you don 't stand a chance of un-lesbianizing Jenny . Naw , screw you guys . I 'm gonna go get advice from someone who knows what the hell they 're talking about . Todd , wait ! We don 't need Jenny ! I know what you 're thinking Hannah . Now that Jenny 's a lesbian you can finally make a move on Todd . No , I wasn 't . Shhh . Hush . It 's gonna be okay . Dr. Curtis love is here to show you how . Look , it 's like when a tiger gets it 's first taste of human blood , when a girl gets her first taste of some pussy , there 's no turnin ' back . Yup , there 's nothin better than pussy . Stupid Jenny , thinks she 's so superior just because she 's a lesbo . Stupid , sexy lesbo Jenny . Hi , Todd . Hannah , what the hell are you doing ? Just thought I 'd pop by . So , this is where you escape the horrors of Crowley High . It 's just my bedroom . Oh Todd , you 're so modest ! Oh , hey , uh- - 'Gunnilingis' These guys are totally wicked awesome , right ? Hannah are you sure you 're feeling okay . You 're acting really weird . I have a surprise for you . It 's a pure evil detector . It measures ectoplasmic paranormal activity . I designed it just for you . I just need to take a measurement- - Of your crotch . To make sure that the speed shorts are big enough . Your birthday 's on June 30th ! No , it isn 't . I have it on good authority that it is . Oh . It 's so brutal . But feminine . They 've liberated violence from male oppression and claimed it as their own . And check out those cute outfits . I 'm not sure I 'm ready for this . Really ? I guess I was wrong about you . I didn 't realize you were so conservative . If Delilah doesn 't need me anymore , then to hell with her . I don 't need her either . That 's right , ' cause now you have someone better than Delilah . Another you . We 're still on for tonight ? Totally . What the hell are you doing ? No time to talk , Jenny , we 're on the hunt for the book , which apparently , has nothing to do with lesbians . We 're doing fine without you , Jenny . In fact , with you out of the picture Todd can finally focus on paying attention to the people who care about him most . Todd , wait for me ! Need any advice from Dr. Curtis Love ? Jenny , just who I was looking for . I hear you 're going through an experimental phase . It can be a confusing time , but as your guidance counselor , which is what I am , I want to assure you that your feelings are normal and perfectly natural . That 's why I bought you this lesbian basket . Aww , youth . I remember my first sexual experience . GRRRRRRRRR Leave it in the past , Atticus . My point is you should just dive into this whole lesbian thing and not worry about what happened to your father . My father , what do you know about what happened to him ? What happened to your father , I have no idea . Maybe he ran off with a nice lesbian . Those muffins are vegan , just what every fatherless lesbian could wish for . I just said father again , didn 't I ? Well , I tried . ♪ What 's wrong ? I think I need some space , Dee . I 've got a lot to deal with . We can deal with it together . I 'm sorry , I can 't ! Jenny , wait ! Come here , my sexy unicorn , let me poke you with my horn . God , is that all you ever think about ? Actually , I 've been thinking we should reveal our love to the school . I don 't think that 's a good idea . Are you ashamed of me ? It 's not you , it 's me . Same diff , Brittany . Let me hold you . I thought I could love you the same way I love Delilah , but I guess I was wrong . You don 't love me ? You 've been wonderful . But , you 're not Delilah . You understand , don 't you ? Loud and clear . CRACK Hurry up , Britt , I gotta go ! I 'm not in the bathroom . Then who is ? Good morning , Delilah . Good morning , Delilah . Good morning , Delilah . Come play with us , Delilah . For ever and ever . BANG-BANG-BANG ! BANG-BANG-BANG ! Where 's the book ? Delilah must have taken it . Nice ass , Britt . Thanks . Oh , Dee , I 'm so sorry about last night . I 've just been so confused . Oh , baby , I get it . Open up your little heart to Dee . Dee , just kiss me , make me forget my troubles . What 's wrong ? I just can 't do it . Brittany ? But why ? We 're going to use you as bait , to lure Delilah out of hiding and give us back the book . You have the book ? Ugh , figures . Who 's we ? Hiya ! Heya ! This is what I get for going through an experimental phase . Get away from her , you bitch ! No Dee ! That book will fuck you up ! It 's too late . Fuck you , bitch-hole ! Just fuck her face ! Suck my cock , bitch ! Tear her tits off ! I don 't think mom is gonna call you the pretty one anymore ! Fucking bitch-faced bitch ! What the hell are you guys doing in here ? Do you know what 's been going on in the rest of the school ? Brittany and Delilah used the book to clone themselves . And they 're waging a gang war . Well what are we waiting for ? Come on , let 's go ! My Book Of Pure Evil detector isn 't functioning properly . Why don 't we just follow the sounds of the screaming ? Jenny 's right , enough screwing around . Come on ! Hey Jenny . Look , I know you 've been through a lot lately , you know what with the whole dad disappearing anniversary and starting a gang war between twin lesbian clones , and I keep saying the wrong thing . So I 'm just gonna keep it simple . We 're here for you , and I 'm here for you . Even if you are a carpet muncher . Thanks , Todd , I think . So was that sensitive but manly enough for you to turn back to team testosterone ? You just don 't give up , do you ? No , not even when failure is guaranteed . He 's still in love with her , what am I supposed to do ? Move to plan B. What 's plan B ? Plan A was free but plan B is gonna cost ya . Dee ! I 'm so sorry , Dee . I couldn 't be what you needed me to be and I feel like this is partly my fault . Dee ! I 'm so sorry , Dee . I couldn 't be what you needed me to be and I feel like this is partly- - Uh , Jenny , There 's more bodies over here . Dee ! Whatever , let 's just go find the book . Oh Hannah . What have you become ? Dee ! Give me the book , Dee . It 's the only way to stop this madness . No , Delilah ! Sisters gotta stick together . You 're not my sister , you 're just some duplicate . How is that different from being a twin ? We still share the same D.N.A. , the same blood , the same family . And how do you even know you 're the first Delilah ? You could be just a clone too . No , Dee ! I know the real you . The real you that I 've grown fond of . Do you love me Jenny ? I , uh , have very strong feelings for you . That 's just not good enough . I think everything 's going to be all right . We will never find the book if it flies away every time we defeat it . We need to figure out who 's going to get the book next . Or we choose who 's gonna get the book next . Yeah . Todd , can I talk to you privately ? I 've been doing a lot of thinking . And I realize now , that you 're not the one for me . And I 'm not the one for you . And that 's okay , and I have no choice but to let you go . Huh ? I 'm breaking up with you . I didn 't even know that we were going out . If denial helps you cope with the pain , then that 's okay . Heal thyself . Good to have you back , Hannah . Looks like my work here is done . Go . But , you said you had strong feelings for me . What 's changed ? I think that 's pretty obvious , Dee . You 're just afraid that our love with never be embraced by a patriarchal heterosexual society . No , that 's not it . You 'll always have me , Dee .

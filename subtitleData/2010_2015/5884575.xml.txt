 - Previously on warehouse 13 ... - Claudia , your sister is alive . - Nick broke into the warehouse And released a guy named paracelsus . Paracelsus was caretaker of warehouse 9 . brilliant . He 's gonna make himself immortal . No ! Stop ! too late , agent lattimer . Tell me how to use these things so I can save myka . - Mrs. Frederic is ... - No longer the caretaker . - This is my house now ! I have to stay and fight paracelsus . The warehouse will protect me . - You are the next . And you are the past . It 's over . - Get out of my warehouse . - Looks like your warehouse Still has a little bit of a crush on me . Fancy . What else you got ? You 're wasting your time , voldemort . I 'm as much a part of this warehouse as you are , And it won 't let you kill me . - Yes , you are , aren 't you ? - Here 's a fun game . Why don 't we see if the warehouse Will let me kill you ? It occurs to me , if I control the warehouse And you are a part of the warehouse , Then I control you . Thank you , child . So attentive . I 'm going to enjoy throwing your carcass Into the lehmann fornax . - Such a spirited girl . I 'll miss it when you 're gone . Come now . Show me everything you know . aah ! claudia ! - Need your treatment . - I 've done it . - Joshua ! - Someone used my time machine . - Look beyond what you see . - I cast you out ! - Fascinating . You know , I , too , was thought to be mad . We have that in common . Except I 'm a normal human being And you 're a sociopathic murderer . Other than that , we 're twins . - Up . Sit . Type . Who the hell 's karl schwarzschild ? What am I looking for ? You are going to help me combine a few artifacts To build something ... Something that will change everything . ¶ - You 've had surgery . No strenuous activity , no exercise , No spicy foods . Understood ? - Yes , absolutely . I 'm gonna go home and go straight to bed . Pete ! Hi , hey . - Hey , hey . My friend is gonna take me from here . Thank you . Bye . get me out of here . Wait . What ? So ... Wait , so ... so we 're ... We 're all good , right ? - Yeah , we 're good . - Mykes ? - Pete . - Seriously . - Pete . - Oh , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , but saying my name Does not allay my fears . - I 'm okay , okay ? It 's a bit of a wake-up call , but the cyst was benign . Benign means ... - no , I know what benign means . - Well , good . - Does that mean ... Do you mean ... - it means that I 'm fine . - So we 're all good downtown ? - Oh , my god . We are never talking about my lady parts ever again . Well , now , when you say , " lady parts , " - No . Enough . - ' cause you know how I ... No . Just tell me what is going on at the warehouse . - Not much . Quit whining about the purple goo ! It 's a rental ! - So how fast should I go ? - As fast as you can ! And you 're sure that this is gonna work ? Yes , of course it 's gonna work ! You 've seen me do ... fine , I 'll do it again . Look ! See ? Nothing to worry about ! You 're gonna get claudia out of there ! All right , now , you back up about 200 feet And then get us in there ! I 'm on my way to meet mr . Kosan and the regents . They 're sequestered and unreachable At their retreat abroad . A hell of a time for a retreat . I don 't think a warehouse coup was on anyone 's calendar . Have you gotten claudia out yet ? - Well , we 're just about to . Nothing to worry about on this end . Good . Keep me posted . - Yeah . - That didn 't work . And yet it felt so successful . Maybe if we double the goo and you go twice as fast . No , let 's wait for pete to get back with myka . Maybe they 'll think of something less life-threatening . All right , come on , I 've got another idea , Only we 'll need a couple of crowbars And a crowded parking lot . How did paracelsus become an all-powerful caretaker ? Because I was making him mortal , okay ? So that I could ... Well , so that he could ... You didn 't know . Myka is dying . All right , look , I had two artifacts , right ? And then all the sudden , the stone Became all sparky and smoky , and then all the sudden , He was out , okay ? He was out , and he tricked me , and I ... And ... I 'm a total idiot . Well , you 're not a total idiot . Why did you have two artifacts ? - Because I was ... Do this , and I will help you combine the artifacts That could cure myka . - I was trying to ... Look , myka , that 's not what matters right now , okay ? What matters is we need to get to this evil wizard Because he 's probably planning something pretty bad , okay ? We got to get past the shield , we got to get back in there , And we got to stop him before ... - The shield . Artie doesn 't know about ... okay , you know what ? We need to get to the innes observatory right now . Drive , okay ? Just ... just drive fast ! - All right . - You can say , " emergency , " All you want , but it 's still illegal . Oh , please , of all the illegal things I 've done , This is probably the least illegal . Remember , we 're trying to save claudia 's life . Yes , and that 's gonna be a lot harder to do from prison . How do we take down someone who 's immortal ? - I 've been doing some digging . We 're gonna use the arrow that brought down The demigod achilles . - Achilles ? Come on , that 's ... that 's a myth . - Yes , it 's a myth . It 's a myth that 's currently stored On aisle corfu 783 . Now , take both the red and the black cable . At the same time , you touch them to the shield ... No , hold it ! Hold it . Hold it . How about I take one and you take the other ? Maybe I 'll stand a chance of living through this . Fine , if that 's what you want . All right , on three . One , two , three ! - Damn it ! you all right ? Oh , no , I 'm fine . I 've got the black cable . Myka ! Are you okay ? I mean , is everything all right down ... We are not talking about that , okay ? What the hell are you guys still doing out here ? Am I really the only one that reads The regents ' addendums to the manual ? Okay , look , we know that the shield draws its power From the alpha centauri star system . - I knew that . - No , he didn 't . - I did . Continue . After sykes used the shield against us , The regents installed a fail-safe Up at the innes observatory . We were just there . Really cool place ... telescopes . It was all explained as addendum nqz-437 - I 've been meaning to read ... - I thought that was junk mail . Since I turned evil and tried to poison the world . - Okay . - That 's the best excuse . - He wins . - Anyway , I redirected The laser scope from the centauri system to uranus . - I thought it was pronounced ... - uranus . It makes the shield appear to stay in place , Yet we can pass through it . Steve , if you would . - Oh , no . No , no , not today . - Are you kidding me ? - You big crybaby . We could 've just walked through ? - Ur-anus ! Abigail got me up to speed on the eldunari . I think I can disconnect paracelsus from the warehouse , But I 'm gonna need some cover when I go down there , And I 'm gonna need another pair of hands . Done . Steve and I will create a diversion While you and myka go down and disconnect his mojo . Excellent . I 've got a plan I 'm absolutely certain will work . Trust me . Make him go first . I wish we had a gun or a tesla . Nah , I shot para-cojones . It just pissed him off . But we have to pick up achilles ' arrow . Right . First , we got to create our little diversion . We 're here ! Hey , para-normal ! Why don 't you come out and fight like a ... claudia ! - Claude , you 're okay . - No , no , no ! Guys , listen ! - And you 're battle-ready . Paracelsus has control over my entire ... run ! You heard the lady . Let 's go ! Jeez , claude ! Whoa ! Not cool ! Not cool ! You guys are just gonna have to run faster . Try and fight his control of your body ! Oh , my god , what a great idea , steve ! I wish I 'd thought of that ! I can 't fight it . And these are al capone 's machine guns ! - What do they do ? - They shoot bullets ! Run ! Aah ! - Oh , thank god . - Is it safe ? - Probably not . Oh , that 's a definite no . This was from hitler 's bunker ... So it 'll probably blow up twice ! - Yeah , twice . So this is where we disconnect paracelsus ? We 've got to put the fires back in the alcoves And get the nordic symbols back on all the walls . So abigail was certain about this ? - Not entirely . We 've never had a caretaker this strongly connected . But we don 't have a plan " b , " so let 's give these a try . Oh , artie , those are beautiful ... No ! Do not look in the mirrors ! They 're 4,000 years old . They belonged to an akkadian emperor , sargon the great . Legend has it that he used these to reflect sunlight Into the eyes of his enemies , the sumerians , blinding them ! Okay , I don 't see any sumerians around , So what is the plan ? We will simultaneously reflect these flames Into the adjoining alcoves , reigniting them . What happens if it 's not exactly simultaneous ? - Unclear . The flames will probably consume us both . That sounds pretty clear to me . If abigail is right , then the other two alcoves ... They 're gonna reignite , and that 'll restart the symbols , And it 'll disconnect paracelsus from the warehouse . - If abigail is right . - It is not an exact science . I know . I miss exact science . - On three . And one , two ... - Wait ! There 's a lot of dust down here ! - Two , three ! - What about the other two ? - It 's a dead end . - I 'm really sorry . - No ! No ! Artie , the other two ... they 're not igniting ! - Wait . Wait . Oh , come on ! Ah ! yes ! He 's not controlling me anymore ! Well , they sure took their sweet time . I should 've killed them when I ... No . It doesn 't matter . oh , my god ! So what 's paracelsus been up to ? - You 're gonna hate this . - A time machine ? - H.G. Wells ' time machine ? But that only sends your consciousness back in time . Why would he want that ? A bunch of different artifacts and connecting them to it . Yeah , yeah , he was trying to get me to mix together A couple artifacts when I was trying to save my ... Ass . My ass . My ... ' cause when ... Continue . Uh , he 's set up at the same spot sykes found the portal . He forced me to help him . So after we set up h.G. ' s time machine , He rigged up the tesla coil to power it . And then he started with different artifacts . There was a telescope from the marquis de laplace . French astronomer and mathematician . To postulate the existence of black holes . What else ? - Pocket watch ... Belonged to karl schwarzschild . Yeah , provided the first exact solution To einstein 's field equations of general relativity . The last thing was a very old sundial . - Theodosius of bithynia . I 'm so glad people today have names like dave . He was , uh , the greek astronomer , right ? Three very powerful artifact cogs In a possible machinery That lets you travel through time . So that 's why he 's at the portal . He 's planning a trip . - But to where and to when ? Yeah , it doesn 't matter . We 've got to stop him . Right , we 'll meet at the portal . Pete , you three stop and pick up the arrow That killed achilles . It wouldn 't hurt to pick up a couple guns too . Myka and I have to pick something up first . - What ? - I 'll explain later . Go . - Jeez . - Hey , he 's going through it . - Pete , shoot . you lose again , agent lattimer . Welcome to the new world order . You 're not gonna get away with this ! - Wait . - Take this . - Ow . - Artie , what just happened ? I 'm not s ... wait a minute . Did he ... uh , pete ? - Yeah ? - Whoa . - Artie , look . - His face ... It 's on all the banners . He was caretaker of the last five warehouses . - He did it . He did something that changed everything . These banners clearly show a series of warehouses , Which tells me he did not alter history significantly , Because the same empires still rose and fell . He was immortal when he went back , Which would explain why he 's still around , right ? You know , I need to find that arrow And plunge it into his chest by hand this time . Look at the motto on the banners . " scientia sit omne . " - " science is everything . " - He 's focused the warehouse Entirely on scientific pursuits . Sorry about your steampunk , artie . - I want him dead . Yeah , but if the world changed , why didn 't we ? That 's why we gave you the forks . See , the palace at versailles was known To experience time-slips . And louis xiv 's silverware Was somehow imbued with the power To keep him and his court in the same time continuum . luke , use the fork . La , la , la , la , la , la , la , la , la . Don 't try and explain time travel . It never makes sense , and it always makes my head hurt . We 're here . The world is different . Let 's find parry and kick his ass . Hey , guys , check this out ... very minority report . This is light-years ahead of us . I mean , I can do some stuff , but it 's mostly ... - Good afternoon . Welcome to warehouse 13 . - What the ... - How may I assist you ? Wait , wait , wait . That 's a hologram . Programmed himself as the guide . He 's like that annoying paper clip . Jeez , the ego on this guy . Claude , can you just make him disappear ? Oh , it looks like his focusing on science Led to some improvements . Really ? Like when he created immortality By slaughtering an entire village In 16th-century constantinople ? Or the 200 hospital patients he murdered in cold blood ? - Or maybe not . Look at the rest of the motto . " media ad finem justificat . " " the end justifies the means . " Yeah , I don 't want to think about how many people He 's killed over the last 500 years . It 's gonna take me hours to hack this system . I mean , the way it responds to me ... It 's like it 's organic , it 's thinking . I got to get to the hub . Maybe that way I can get him . Yeah , yeah , no , wait , wait , wait . I 'm gonna need you to reconstruct his time machine . No , no , no , I can walk you , myka , and steve through it . Pete and I need to get to the hub . So pete and myka can follow him back through the portal And stop him from doing it . And since when do you decide who does what ? I just think we should make an informed decision , You know , like , about dead relatives , don 't you ? - Uh ... Judging by the way these fiber optics Are joining up , I 'd say the hub can 't be ... So you want to tell me what that was all about ? - What ? - You , artie , tension , Informed decisions and dead relatives ? I 'm sorry ... I left my claudia / artie code book In my other pants , so spill . Oh , man . They have borgs here ? Why does the creepy killer 's warehouse Get to be cooler than ours ? - What 's on their eyes ? Oh , that 's an artifact from warehouse 12 . Uh , chester moore hall ? Oh , right , his achromatic lens , I thought there was just one of those . What ? - Oh , man . That 's the spine of saracen . That 's the first artifact that almost killed me . And now there are four of ' em . He 's replicating artifacts , Artifacts that create unstoppable soldiers . - Very good , gentlemen . - Holy crap , it 's valda . You can feel my commands without my having to voice them . What is benedict valda doing here ? He died in egypt in a pit of fire . Not in this reality he didn 't . I guess the warehouse attracts the same people , No matter what . - Oh , great . Maybe macpherson and walter sykes Are running the snack bar . - Okay , let 's go . - Wait , claudia . Claudia , wait ! - What ? Do you think there 's a snack bar ? Okay , the time machine 's set up . What else do we need ? Telescope , watch ... both : Sundial . Yeah . Now , you two have ... - What is that ? Pete said that was what paracelsus liked to do , Was combine artifacts . - Artie , are you all right ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . It 's just that I remember Things my parents used to say ... The kind of things that the doctors used to do ... In the camps during the war . He 's turned my warehouse into a world of endless terror . Well , then let 's go stop him . Good to know locks haven 't changed that much . Or that I can pick any lock , even a futuristic one . Now , if we can just find the mainframe , Hopefully I can ... - Abigail ! Doc , are you okay ? What ... what did they ... - What is your request ? I think we found the organic element I kept running into . - Huh ? Paracelsus actually found a way to harness a human brain For computer power . Okay , claude , we got to get her out of this . No , no , no , no , not knowing how she 's wired , We 'd likely kill her by doing that , But maybe she can help . I 'm sorry . That information is classified . - Okay . I 'm sorry . That information is classified . Shall I contact dr . Paracelsus for clearance ? Both : No , no , no , no . - Thank you . there 's got to be some , like , low-level info That could help us . - Okay , let 's just ... Tiptoe , okay ? sneaky , sneaky quiet . - Okay . That tesla coil may not have enough juice in it To keep the portal open Long enough for pete and myka to come back through . We 're gonna have to start looking For another power source . - What was that ? Well , even though the fork 's masked Our physical presence here , we 're moving artifacts around , So claudia was able to cloak that By hacking into the f.I.S.H. , but ... Yeah , there 's a power drain there too . - June 10 , 1541 . - Myka , set the date . Pretty sure he went to warehouse 9 . - How can you tell ? - Because on June 10th ... All of the regents of warehouse 9 And we all know who likes to kill large groups of people And there were never any regents appointed ever again . The caretaker ran the warehouse and supervised . Well , that would explain all the changes . Okay , you guys , no more time . Throw the switches . You two ... you 're gonna have to go back to warehouse 9 . You 're gonna have to find him . Damn it . We lost the f.I.S.H. - Intruder . There is an intruder in the warehouse . Intruder . There is an intruder in the warehouse . Okay , pete , myka , go back ! Stop him ! Claudia , you and steve keep the portal open till they get back ! - What are you gonna ... - Hey , jackboots . I 'm guessing I 'm just your type . - Artie ! - Claude , claude ! He 's probably gonna need you not captured So you can go and rescue him , don 't you think ? Yeah , right . You guys , go . We 'll fix this , claude . Pete , come on . Hey , hey , you guys , save artie . I 'm guessing because we have these forks , We probably stay dead in either time continuum . No , no , no , no , no time-travel talk . Ooh , I bet I 'm gonna get blamed for that . - Yes , that 's very likely . prepare to die . Okay , look , I 'm really sorry about the arrow , And I 'm sure my partner had a perfectly good reason For killing all these guys . Pete , I did not kill those guys . Silence ! Or I shall silence you . - Okay , off on the wrong foot . I 'm special agent pete lattimer from warehouse 13 . Lisa davinci ... agent of warehouse 9 . Great . Lisa da ... Davinci ? As in ... as in leonardo ? - He was my grandfather . Really ? That 's amazing . Yeah , I mean , if you have anything that he 's ever drawn , Hold on to it , ' cause it 's gonna go through the roof and ... - Pete . - Right . Lisa , what I 'm about to tell you is gonna blow your mind . We are time travelers ... From the future . Really ? Nothing ? Can 't I even get an " oh , my god " ? Oh , my god , what took you so long ? My grandfather 's been working on time travel for over 40 years . Well , we 've been working on stuff , too , Like , uh , movies and television and popcorn . Huh ? I bet you don 't have that . You two are nothing more than strangely dressed killers From the future . Strangely dressed ? These are prada . Okay . - Good one . - Thank you . Look , we did not kill these men , all right ? Paracelsus did . - Paracelsus ? That 's impossible . He was encased in bronze this very day . - Mr. Valda . Mr. Valda , this is ... this is wrong ! The warehouse doesn 't use artifacts like this ! The warehouse has been a leader In human experimentation for centuries . - No , no . This is a false continuum . People who believe in multiple realties Are generally considered insane . We have several artifacts that can cure that . - Listen to me . This is the day , isn 't it ? I 'd almost forgotten . This is the day when I changed everything . 500 years and you 've learned nothing ! Just another single-minded ideologue Turning science into fascism . Well , I 've replaced your creaky old storage unit With a state-of-the-art research facility . I 'm sure it will have impressed your associates . I 'm here alone . There 's no one else . I don 't even know h-how I got here . Oh , now you 're just being forgetful . Major valda , shall we have the doctors see Which combination of artifacts Might jog agent nielsen 's memory ? You will be thrilled to see how much can be learned When we use artifacts as tools Rather than collectibles . Quite useful to mankind . Doctors . - We have a new volunteer ? - There ... Jack lalanne 's stationary bike should be enough Jumper cables again ... what could possibly go wrong ? - I 'm gonna go save artie . Well , how long do I have to keep pumping ? - Till pete and myka get back . Ride with your ass , not your knees . - Always do . - ¶ crazy No , I know . I know I sound insane , But I ... but I actually do know you . I know you both very well . Vanessa , look at me . Look , we 're in love . I 'd use any excuse to see you . You 've removed my appendix several times . Well , that must have been some affair . What did we do for our honeymoon ... A kidney transplant ? 'nessa , we 've been married this long . You 've never touched my appendix . Should I be hurt ? - Listen to me . Paracelsus is abusing artifacts . He is torturing innocent people . - Keep your voice down . This is for the advancement of science And the betterment of humanity . - Yes , yes , it is . - No , he 's a murderer ! Please be quiet . Please . He 's gonna hear you . So what ? So what if he hears me ? - Please , please . - You 're afraid of him . - We are not . We 're good friends ... Very good friends . - You 're lying . What are you not telling me ? - He has our children . Please just let us do our jobs . Now , this is joan of arc 's helmet . - No . - It will help you , And it won 't hurt very much . No ! Hugo , you 're lactose intolerant , You snore , you 're afraid to have a heart scan 'cause heart disease runs in your family . - How do you know that ? Vanessa , you 've wanted to be a doctor Since you were a little girl and your family dog was killed And you couldn 't save it . I 've never told anyone that . So , 500 years after you guys here at warehouse 9 bronzed him , He got released . If the mirror proves you truthful , I shall help in any way I can . Well , thank you for trusting us a little . - So how does this thing work ? Well , when I hold the candle against the mirror , It will show us the shadows of recent events . Oh , like the durational spectrometer . Oh , you 're serious . Are those real words ? You have a great smile . You busy after this ? - Pete . - Right . - Lisa , if you would . - Is someone there ? paracelsus ? It can 't be ! - Aah ! Oh , my god . Oh , my god . I told you we didn 't kill those guys . He 's on his way to murder the regents . We need to get to them before he does . They 're meeting today to appoint a caretaker In place of paracelsus . - Where do they usually meet ? I don 't know . They 're very secretive . Well , some things never change . Well , if they 're anything like our regents , They meet in public , everyday places , Um , like a coffee shop or t.G.I. Friday 's , olive garden . Of course ! That 's it . They 're at the olive garden . - Yes . - Seriously ? White-chocolate raspberry cheesecake ? Do not tease me ! We have men scouring every corner of the warehouse . If they 're here , we 'll find them . Well , maybe agent nielsen is alone . The others ... I need to see if some artifacts have been moved . Come with me . Vanessa , now , you know I 'm telling the truth . I can see it in your eyes . I don 't care how you know what you know . We have to do this . Yes . The pursuit of science Is the only thing that matters . Now , this is a spindle From the very first rack that was ever used ... In the tower of london . Yes , I know . And that 's bleckwenn 's stethoscope . First physician that had any success with truth serum . Good . Then you probably also know That if used together , It might extract the truth . Yes . It also might fry my brain . Claudia . Thank god . - Heartbreaking , isn 't it ? When someone you love , someone you thought you knew Turns out to be someone else . I know you 're upset about your sister , But I 'm not someone else . I 'm still the same man that 's loved you like a father In electrified handcuffs and kidnapped me . I 'm just trying to protect you . - You can 't , artie . You can 't protect me anymore . You have to let me make my own mistakes , And you have to let me get hurt If that 's what 's supposed to happen . - She 's right , you know . But I 'm afraid neither of you will be protecting anyone . I feel strongly a temporary caretaker Be named from among us . The warehouse must be protected . The true caretaker will show himself In due course . - Et voila . - Paracelsus , how did you ... Guards ! - Your guards are dead . And how you cope in the next few moments Will determine whether or not you join them . your days are over . You see , I intend to lead the warehouse into the future ... A future that will shake off the chains Of fundamentalism , ignorance , and myth , A future that will proudly embrace science As the one true faith . So the question is , Are you with me , or are you against me ? I said , " are you with me ? " - No , we are not . No one person shall ever lead the warehouse . No , sir . - Excellent . That makes this much easier . - Oh , a real olive garden . That elephant tusk ... what is it ? A tribe in africa used it against its enemies . It 's the tusk of the only known elephant To have been killed by a boa constrictor . All right , let 's get down there . dude ! There goes our element of surprise . - There goes paracelsus . - Wait . Wait . If you two approach that tusk , you 'll both be killed . Well , do you have any purple goo or ... - What the hell was that ? The purple swamphen , of course . - You guys , be careful . There 's a giant , scary bird heading our way . I know . I called her . Thank you , isabella . Paracelsus is probably headed back to warehouse 9 . If he links up to the eldunari again , He 'll be too powerful . Let 's go . - What the hell is an isabella ? Does the warehouse in the future No longer use purple swamphens to subdue artifacts ? That 's insanity . - Guys , come on . - Hey , artie ... Alice could be here in a flash . Hugo , before you do whatever it is you 're gonna do , Do you mind ... I don 't know ... snapping our picture ? Whoa . He was definitely here . Okay , peter , you head towards the eldunari . Myka and I will circle around in case he wavers in his course . - She 's bossy . - You love it . - I do . - Let 's go . - There goes the f.I.S.H. intruder . Intruder in aisle 487-k . - No , no , not this time . I got a score to settle . - Intruder in aisle 487-k . - You remember this ? - Wait . Let me take him . - No , no , he 's mine . - You don 't deal in lies , huh ? Huh ? Do you remember saying that to me , parry ? Do you remember dangling myka 's life Out in front of me ? - I did not lie . I believed she was dying . - You know what I believe ? I believe we 're gonna have us a nice paracelsii In the bronze sector . - Please d-don 't , don 't . You have no idea what you are giving up , What you are stealing from mankind . You 're gonna make a nice para-bookends . Now let 's go . You 're gonna have to kill me . Well , I 'm glad we agree about that . - Oh . Good . I hope that hurt ! So then the problem was we had two bronzed paracelsii You know , I do have better things to do . No , you don 't . No , you don 't . So is mrs . Frederic reconnected ? Yeah , yeah , she 's back online . I just wish I could shake this ... Uh , I don 't know . - Shake what ? Well , it 's this feeling that something is changing . I can 't explain it , but something has begun . It 's good and bad . I don 't know . Never mind . It 's not comforting , definitely not , And I wish that you were lying . I wonder if this has something to do with my trip . The regents have asked me to meet them abroad ... Very hush-hush . Oh , I always love that about them . - And here we are . Ta-da ! " ralph brunsky , egyptian terrorist . " yeah . - There , okay . that 's where you put him ? - Oh , hilarious . Now put him in the bronze sector . - Aw , dad ! Now , or you 're gonna be grounded for a week . - Question ... Okay , I hate that tone of voice . Why do you have that scalpel you threw at paracelsus ? It was just in my pocket , and sometimes I pick things up . You said that you had two artifacts When you released paracelsus . The scalpel was one of them , wasn 't it ? Oh , my god , I feel like I 'm talking to columbo . Lisa said that it has curative properties . You brought it to paracelsus , didn 't you ? - I don 't remember , myka . That was , like , two time-travels ago . I heard what you whispered into his ear At warehouse 9 , pete . You did it for me , didn 't you ? What ? No . Why ? No . What ? Okay , yeah , maybe I did , all right ? So sue me . I didn 't want you to die . So you risked the warehouse and the world Just to save me ? - Well , yeah . - Don 't . - Ow ! Okay ? We always put the warehouse first . I am your partner . I am not your girlfriend . All right , all right , jeez . I 'm still gonna put you first . Why don 't you go punch that ? Your plan to pull alice out of that mirror Would have absolutely worked , you know . It was a brilliant , brilliant idea . I haven 't forgotten about claire . I want to know about my sister . I know . You never forget anything . But could I maybe just recuperate from all that For five minutes before ... I guess not . What ? 11 . There should be 12 . Hmm .

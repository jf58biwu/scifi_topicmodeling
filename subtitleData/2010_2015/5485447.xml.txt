 You have to come back ... Previously on Fringe ... Because you belong with me . Make the switch . Welcome back . Please , let me out of here . Please , let me out of here ! And our Agent Dunham , has she made contact ? She 's on the other side now . Walter says this tech isn 't from here . They can have an army that can look like anyone they want them to . The shape-shifter 's blood is mercury . I have everything you need for your new identity . Careful , their side might be alluring , but , they started the war . I don 't care how long you 've been here . This is my operation , you work for me . { \ * So ? } What else did you come up with ? And you can 't say pirate again . Definitely a banker . A banker ? Persian Kid Rock ? His long hair is just his link to his individuality . I think they work together . { \ * Well , } She 's wearing her sexiest { \ * little } black dress , so somewhere deep inside of her , she was hoping this dinner was about something else . Not work . But she was wrong . Yes , she was . That , however , is truly impressive . { \ * Yeah , } He 's a little short for her , I 'll grant you that . But not when you stand him on his money . Careful . Your con man 's showing . I think I just understand transactional needs . Each party has something the other party wants . She gets security , he gets her . We all draw our moral lines in the sand . And unless you can put yourself in another man 's shoes , I don 't think you can really judge their situations . But look at the body language . They haven 't slept together yet . You can always tell when a relationship is about to take that next step . I had a really nice time tonight . Me too . But unfortunately , if I don 't get home , Walter 's gonna start wondering where I am . And then he 'll probably start calling the emergency rooms . Shall we ? Thanks . Have a good night . - Could you give me a moment ? - { \ * Yeah , } Of course . I 'll be outside . - Hi , Senator Van Horn . - Hi , girls . { \ * You know , } I 've been looking for { \ * some } lemonade all day . You know where I can find some ? - We 're selling lemonade . - You are ? { \ * Well , } Perfect ! Mrs. Van Horn has me running all over town . I am parched . That looks delicious . How much ? - $ 1.00 . - $ 1.00 ? - We made it ourselves . - { \ * Well , } I don 't know . { \ * You know , } This just might be the best lemonade I have ever had . I 'll see you , okay ? Wait ! You forgot your change ! Victim is unresponsive . Possible head injury . - I don 't feel a pulse { \ * , doctor } . Charge v-fib ? - Not yet . - But he has no pulse . - Then why is he still breathing ? I heard on the news . I got here as fast as I could . - How is he ? - I don 't know . They won 't tell me anything . I want information on James Van Horn . - Prep for intubation and alert the OR . - OR is standing by . Get me a CBC and tox screen . What 's his BP ? I 'm not getting anything . He has no pressure . Start CPR . What the hell is going on with this guy ? - Stand aside , please . - You can 't be in here . Stay here . Stop right there ! Freeze ! FBI ! Drop your weapon ! You , come here ! - I will kill her ! - Drop your weapon ! Do it ! _ . • ´ ¯ ¯ { \ 1cc5bb6e } LIAISON ¯ ¯ ` • . _ ¯ ` • . _ _ { \ 1c9d9e77 } Team _ _ . • ´ ¯ Retrouvez-nous chaque semaine ... pour découvrir les énigmes de Saison 3 Épisode 4 { \ 1caf9659 } Do Shapeshifters Dream of Electric Sheep ? Bon épisode ... You can 't seriously expect me to believe that you 're okay with this . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } { \ * Well , } William 's last wish was that your father take over this company , { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } my personal feelings are not at issue . { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } With a basement lab in Harvard , { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } Walter was able to open a wormhole into another dimension { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } that essentially shredded all the laws of science . { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } I can 't wait to see what he 's capable { \ * of doing } with a multibillion-dollar corporation . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } Your father made some regrettable choices in the past , { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } but his brilliance is undeniable . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } It was that intellect that William Bell believed in . { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } And frankly , so do I. It 's not his intellect I 'm concerned about . { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } So beautiful , { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } it is absolutely breathtaking . Somewhere between pudding and foie gras . { \ * And } Why do I bring this up ? You , with the red hair . It 's black . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } I see red . Answer the question . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } I 'm really not sure why we 're talking about brain physiology . Dear God . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } How can you be so limited ? { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } When William Bell created this company , he knew one thing to be true . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } Brain and the mind are capable of so much . Don 't you see ... { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } that the brain is consciousness ? { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } The mind is God ! { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } There are no limits , { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } except for those that we impose on ourselves . Open your eyes . Open , open . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } Inspiration is everywhere . Do you know how lucky you are to play in this sandbox ? { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } My heart is racing . God ! { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } Is anyone else hot in here ? - Sorry to interrupt . - { \ * Peter , } You 're just in time for the good ... Time to put your pants back on { \ * , Walter } . We got a case . We have to go . Of course . I 'll just get my things . He 's a bit unorthodox . He 's also tripping his brains out right now . You know that , right ? Van Horn was admitted at 1400 hours . Newton came in 15 minutes later and went on a shooting spree . Look at that . It 's like he 's got no fear . Clearly , Van Horn was an operative of Newton 's . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } We can only assume Newton knew Van Horn 's identity as a shape-shifter { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } would be revealed after he was injured in the crash . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } So Newton came here to retrieve him . And when he couldn 't , he shut him up . In the right light , your hair looks like strands of lemon diamonds . - He self-medicated this morning . - Don 't worry . I do some of my finest work self-medicated . { \ pos ( 192,200 ) } Good , { \ pos ( 192,200 ) } because not only was James Van Horn a sitting US senator with top level clearance , { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } he was a good man . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } I want to know how long ago he was replaced { \ * by a shape-shifter } and for what purpose . I want a full accounting of every committee he sat on , every classified briefing he had . { \ * Okay . Well , } I 'll make sure that his office is locked down . If they can get to a sitting senator , the { \ * whole } government could be compromised . I know . I 'm gonna call Dan Gilmore at the CDC and arrange blood tests for everyone on the hill . Examine the body , see what you can find . Of course . I think I 'll go examine the body and see what I can find . So is it a machine ? Where can I purchase some candy buttons ? Those little candies attached to rolls of paper . Do they still make those ? I wouldn 't know . I try not to eat sugar . So if it 's not a machine , it 's human ? Nerve hook . To answer your question , it is neither ... and both . Part machine , part organic . A shape-shifter . Such an inspired creation . Frankly , I 'm a little envious that Belly thought of it before I did . How 's it going in here ? You 'll be happy to know that having something to focus on ... is calming ... the vividness of my hallucinations . I think I 'll probably be able to take it from here , Agent . Thank you . So , Walter . I 'm glad she 's gone . Very negative energy . It seems pretty specific , don 't you think , Walter ? - One shot , right through the eye ? - That 's a good question . Assuming ... that Newton shot the shape-shifter to incapacitate him , perhaps ... this is the location of some sort of power source . So assuming that you 're right , do you think we could fix it ? Fix him ? We could try . - What were you thinking ? - Van Horn was in a car accident . He was a liability . I had to act quickly . { \ * Okay . } What did he know ? He was a senior operative . He knew everything . - Did he know about me ? - Of course . Who do you think provided the info { \ * rmation } on Olivia Dunham and the Fringe team ? Don 't worry . He 's been disabled . Or as you people call it , he 's dead . He can 't talk , and data recovery 's impossible . Your cover 's safe , for now . What do you mean , my cover is safe for now ? I don 't know what your mission is , Olivia , and you 've made it very clear that it 's none of my concern . Whatever it is , I imagine it requires you to gain Peter Bishop 's complete trust . What makes you think that I don 't already have it ? { \ * Well , } Maybe it 's because I 'm looking in from the outside , but ... I 'm willing to wager that somewhere , deep inside his brain , Peter Bishop senses that something is not quite right with you , that something has changed , that you 're not his Olivia . { \ * Okay , } You need to remember who you 're talking to . You 're in over your head . You 're not fully committed to this task , and because of that , you will fail . Did you know , in the 19th century , hatmakers used mercury to flatten the fur on hat brims ? Sadly , the mercury caused significant brain damage . Hence , where Lewis Carroll got the term " mad hatter " . Thank you , Walter . That will be very helpful next time I 'm on Jeopardy ! . I can 't animate this shape-shifter . Not here . Perhaps if we moved the body back to my lab ... Sure , I 'll have the body transferred back to Harvard right away . My other lab . The equipment of Massive Dynamic is state of the art . I 'll call Nina right now . I think I might be peaking again . Peter , perhaps chamomile tea would help . Stop , stop . What 'd you just do , Walter ? I must have triggered something . So how 's it going in here ? Agent Dunham , good news . It seems this tin can is still kicking . Agent Astrid Farnsworth . I 'm here to see Dr. Bishop . I 've got an " Astro " Farnsworth . That 's me . You know , the old me would have been ... really disgusted by that . Finally . Did you get everything on the list ? - I don 't even want to know . - Which one are you referring to ? Both . Did you get the candy buttons ? - Do you really think that he 's ... - They 're for me . Now , do you mind telling me what all this stuff is for ? We 're making a treasure map . Somewhere inside this creature is a data storage unit , and now that he 's alive , I 'm going to find it . Using those items as visual stimuli , we are going to map its neural pathways ... well , what we would think of as its brain . - And what are we hoping to find ? - Its memories , Astrid . Everything it knows . Who it was working for . If there were others . You look shocked . You just called me Astrid . You never get my name right . Must be the LSD . These are Senator Van Horn 's Homeland Security briefings , - going back three years . - Great . Thank you . { \ * You know , } I can handle this , if you wanna go check on Walter , see how he 's doing . Astrid must be there by now . If they 've learned anything , I 'm sure they 'll call . The senator made requests for classified intelligence 29 times last month . - There 's nothing here . - { \ * Well , i } If he 's like the other shape-shifters , he 's gonna be careful . He 's not gonna leave anything here that would tell us he wasn 't the senator . Except for one thing . He didn 't know that today was the day he was gonna die . Unless he had someone come in here and clean up after him , there 's gotta be something . It 's Rachel . I should take this . Tell her I said hi . Hey , Rache , what 's up ? Do you know it 's customary to leave one message , and the caller will get back to you ? Not thirty . He 's alive . Van Horn is alive . - That 's impossible . - You underestimated them . He 's on the 23rd floor of Massive Dynamic . Dr. Bishop 's working on him now . - I 'll take care of it . - You 'd better . I think I found something . What is it ? It 's you . You ... and me ... and Walter ... All of us . Every case we ever worked on . He knew everything . You wannna pretend the train 's going into the station ? I 'm 7 1 / 2 , mom . You forget you 're dealing with a very mature young man here . I 'll tell them we don 't want any . Come on , asparagus , it 's great . And it 'll make your pee smell funny . Real funny . Hello , Ray . I have an assignment for you . The body 's in the lab on the 23rd floor . You expect me to break into Massive Dynamic ? You don 't have to . Just shift into a new body assigned to you still , someone with clearance . It shouldn 't be a problem . Is it ? I 'm just surprised . I haven 't seen you in five years . You know , that 's the way it works . After this mission , you 'll take a new identity . And Ray ? No traces left behind . Nothing that can expose us . Understood ? I 'll contact you when it 's done . Good . I 've got Bureau agents stationed throughout the building , and an NYPD security detail has set up a perimeter . So what makes you think that Newton would try to recover the shape-shifter ? I 'd rather be wrong than sorry . - Good , I heard you were back . - Hold on , Walter , hold on . According to the files in Van Horn 's office , he 's been collecting intel { \ * on us } for the last two years . Which suggests when he was shifted . Besides Newton , anything about other shape-shifters ? { \ * Anything t } That would tell us who they 're working with , how they get their orders ? So did you find anything in DC ? We ran blood tests on every person who works on the hill . Everyone checks out . What about the DOD and FBI ? The shape-shifters could have infiltrated their ranks too . We 're testing everyone with a level four classification or above . We 've gotta go wider . Van Horn can 't be the only { \ * mole } one . - There 's just no way ... - Maybe we should just ask him . - What ? - That 's what I 've been trying to say . If you want to know who the shape-shifter 's been working with , I think we should just ask him . Is it even possible that there 's recoverable data left in Van Horn ? Walter thinks so . We 've been trying various techniques to locate it . At first , we did not have very much luck . With everyday objects , the shape-shifter only had a minimal reaction . But then we tried something more personal . Watch the monitors closely . Here 's what happens when I show it a toy car . No neural activity . But ... when I show ... a photograph of the senator 's wife ... So those areas are where the data is ? We haven 't found any data storage . Not yet , we haven 't , but I believe we can continue to revive the neural pathways by playing upon this emotional tie . I 'm not following , Walter . It 's a machine . And to succeed in its mission , it needed to play the role of a spouse . And pretending to have an emotional connection caused a real one to form . The ability to process complex emotions is built into the machine 's operating system . We just needed a stronger trigger to find the data . We need to use Van Horn 's wife . { \ * Oh , } I don 't think we can ask that of a civilian , Walter . { \ * I mean , } Not to mention the security clearance it would require . It 's the only way . Broyles , I know she 's a friend of yours , - but if we could get at that data ... - I don 't think it 's a good idea . Imagine the panic if she talks to the press . I 've known Patricia Van Horn for most of my adult life . Her character 's beyond question . If she 's willing to help us , I 'm willing to trust her . { \ * PUB } Hey , buddy , what are you still doing up ? I didn 't sound the monster alarm , but I think he 's here . Where ? Under the bed . You know ... sometimes ... monsters aren 't all that bad . Sometimes ... if you get to spend some time with them , they can be very surprising . They can be ... incredibly sweet ... and pure ... and capable of great , great love . And then , one of them might actually become your very , very best friend . But you 're my best friend . Yeah , that 's right . Are you going to work ? Come check on me when you get back ? I will . Patricia , this is Agent Olivia Dunham and Peter Bishop . - Hello . - Hi . I 'm , I 'm sorry . I know that what we 're asking you to do is difficult . Frankly , it all seems a bit beyond comprehension . Last week was our granddaughter 's first birthday . You should have seen the way Jim held her in his arms . He was so happy . And now , the thought that he was really this ... thing . If this is too much for you ... I want to be here . I want to know who did this to my husband . { \ * Well , } That 's what we 're hoping to find out too . You ready ? I 'm ready . Hi , James . It 's me , Patricia . Can you hear me ? Is that what you want ? It 's perfect . But if you could please talk to him and not at him . It 's quiet in the house without you . I finished the curtains . I can 't sleep . It 's just something to do . This is not good . Maybe if you could touch him . Perhaps a gentle caress or tickle . Excuse me ? I 'm just suggesting possible ways ... { \ * No } It 's okay . I understand . Jim ... The kids have been asking for you . Grayson called yesterday . Neural activity is rising . Lucy said her first word . " Shoes " . It 's working . We 're close . I 've been thinking of all the years we had . I know it wasn 't always easy . I 'm sorry I didn 't know ... you were gone . I don 't know ... how I didn 't know . You would have known . I know you would have . The lower base of his spine . No , something 's wrong . It doesn 't make any sense . I don 't know if you can ever forgive me , but I ... - I 'm so sorry ... - 11 , 10 , 12 , Whitefield . 11 , 13 , - 16 , Beaufain . - Walter , what 's happening ? - I don 't know . - 11 , 17 , Essex . It could be ciphertext , like a code , maybe . - No , he 's on a loop . - 11 , 13 ... - Stop it ! - That 's enough ! What was that ? I don 't know . Maybe we triggered a corrupted file , a mishmash of discarded data . I know what that was . Next month was our anniversary . The Beaufain , the Whitefield , the Essex , they 're all hotels . We were leaving November 10th . We 're done here . Let me take you home . Did it help ? Did you find what you were looking for ? You 've done more than enough . It 's no use . There has to be a way to salvage more data . The shape-shifter 's system 's too badly damaged . Any data in there is likely lost . One thing I do know for sure , I am no longer high . Walter , why don 't we take a break and get something to eat ? I don 't have an appetite . { \ * Well , } Maybe just a change of scenery might clear your head , make you feel better . I suppose so . Walter , I thought you said you weren 't hungry ? I 'm eating for comfort . To think what I put that poor woman through , and the most activity we saw occured in the shape-shifter 's ass . It was his lower spine , Walter . Look , animal cookies . - You love these . - No . Belly loved them . I occasionally eat them to honor him , that is all . I 'm just trying to cheer you up . Thank you . Belly always thought that dinosaur cookies would have been a better idea . Velociraptor , mm ! Dilophosaurus , yum ! { \ * You know , } I was more of a stegosaurus fan myself . That was Belly 's favorite too . The funny thing about stegosaurus ... Walter , what just happened ? I 'll be right back . Don 't eat my pudding . Did you know that the stegosaurus had a brain in its ass ? Why didn 't I think of it ? The stegosaurus has a massive cluster of nerves above the rump , the sacral ganglion . Evolutionary leap . Separating short term memory from long term memory . Belly , you ingenious son of a bitch . - { \ * PUB } Dr. Bishop , go right ahead . - Thank you . You 're not authorized to be up here . Police are strictly working the lobby . Sir . Patricia Van Horn was living with a shape-shifter for two years . She must have noticed something different . Shape-shifters are good at their job , you know ? I 've been thinking about it . Maybe she did notice , and she just made excuses for herself not to have to deal with it . Or she came up with ways to explain it to herself . Kind of like I 've been doing with you . With me ? With all the little differences ever since we got back from the other side . { \ * And } You did tell me that your experiences on the other side changed you , but since you got back , it 's like ... It 's like you 're a completely different person . You seem less burdened . You 're more patient with Walter . Don 't get me wrong , I like it . The change is good . But it 's different . - Where 's Walter ? - I don 't know . He said he 'd be right back . Astrid , I need you to adjust that light . Step away from him . Stay right there . Don 't move . It was in his spine . I was right . Yeah , you were right . { \ * Look , } He 's probably just gone to the restroom or something . No , he left his pudding . Something must be wrong . Excuse me . That cop , it must have been him . You look for Walter , I 'll go after the shape-shifter . Walter , look at me . Son ? The stegosaurus , Peter . It has two brains . That 's what they were after . I couldn 't find him . So is he all right ? He took a pretty bad knock on the head . I 'll be fine . This is Dunham . We 're on floor 23 . - I need the EMTS here now , please . - Listen to me , there was someone here . We know , Walter . There was a shape-shifter here . And they took what we were after . He took the data out of Van Horn . Walter , oh , my God ! What ? Walter , are you okay ? Under the circumstances , I 'm fine . - I could have been killed . - What are you doing ? The security cameras . If we can ID the shape-shifter , maybe we can catch him before he changes bodies . Come on . Ownership has its privileges . You didn 't shift . I didn 't have to . I got it . Don 't worry about them . I took care of it . We 're clean . Why did you do that ? I didn 't . I couldn 't understand your hesitation . I saw it , but ... I didn 't understand it . I do now . It 's ... It 's them , isn 't it ? I got the disc . I found a way ... And now it 's time for you to move on . This is my life . And now you 'll have another life , just like you had another one before . This is simply a way station for you . A stop along the way . It 's what we do . It 's what we 're made for . It means so much to me ... and I 've come to mean so much to them . How can you ask me to give them up ? { \ * Well , } I suppose I can 't . Keep your hands where I can see them ! Get back in your car ! I need to reach Agent Broyles . It 's urgent . Newton . Newton , where is it ? - Is he alive ? - Where is it ? He 's breathing . - Does he have the disc ? - I can 't find it , but ... we can search properly when I get him into custody . All right . { \ * PUB } Is the Van Horn disc secure ? It is . You 're gonna have a very difficult time without me , you know ? There are plenty of machines here . I can befriend a vacuum cleaner . You 're very good at that . At what ? At continuing to try to convince yourself that you don 't care . But you do care , don 't you ? Every night ... when your head hits the pillow ... in the last moments before you go to sleep , your emotions betray you ... and you question your ability to pull this off . Words like , " integrity " , " self-respect " , they haunt you . They form a line that you 're unwilling to cross ... and that will lead to your undoing . But I suppose that 's not my problem anymore . Here you go . I lied to you . About what ? I don 't want to talk .

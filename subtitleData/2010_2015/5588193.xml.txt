 Previously on " marvel 's agents of s.H.I.E.L.D. " ... [ flatline ] may : You saved skye 's life . What is it ? Why aren 't you happy about it ? Coulson : Being down there ... Seeing where I came from - - I just got really scared That she would suffer the way that I did . May : Agent ward and I have been having sex . Coulson : And if it 's a problem ... I 'll end it . [ indistinct conversations ] Jimmy : I got to grab something real quick . I 'll be right back , my love . Rooster : Get a look at that . H-hey , darlin ' , Gal like you could have any man you want . Why did you marry that little dude ? He loaded ? He 's not my husband . I took him from his bride earlier today . I needed him to provide safe passage . You in trouble ? 'cause if you need a place to lay low for awhile , This is as good as any . [ engine turns over ] oh ! What kind of beast is that ? [ gasps ] it 's a 1987 heritage softail . You can hop on mine , you want to feel a roar . How grand . What is your name ? My men , they call me rooster . You have men ? You are their leader ? [ chuckles ] Last time I checked , yeah . [ wind blows ] [ twinkling ] [ distorted ] you and your men now serve me . This guy bothering you ? [ normal voice ] no . He 's with me now . What ? No ! I 'm with you ! You said we 'd be together forever , remember ? I said we 'd be together till the end . It is the end . No ! [ men murmuring ] Who are you ? I 'm lorelei . Now Introduce me to all of my men . ... Introduce me to all of my men . [ knock on window ] No ! What did I say ? [ sighs ] Damn it . Every time . It 's like you have a sensor For whenever my butt lifts off the bed . Back in it . I just want to stretch my legs . Now . Look ! There 's color in my cheeks . Breathing without ... [ strained ] ... Feeling like my whole body 's on fire . I 'm good . [ chuckles ] " good " is not the appropriate word To describe your state . You 've been shot twice , had your stomach perforated , And a breathing tube shoved down your throat . " better " is the more accurate word . Again with the blood drive ? I 'm not gonna have anything left . [ chuckles ] Not sure how I feel about dr . Simmons . She 's so strict . Ow . And pokey . Well , patient skye is unruly and stubborn . [ sighs ] And grateful . I hope you know that . I didn 't do it alone . Still , I 'm the most ... " grateful-est-est " patient alive . [ chuckles ] That 's not even a word . Hey . This a bad time ? [ grunts ] It is if you 're here to bust me out . [ as simmons ] the warden has extended house arrest . [ scoffs ] terrible accent . [ normal voice ] [ groans ] I must look terrible ! [ chuckles ] [ sighs ] simmons won 't even bring me a mirror . I 've seen worse . Wow . Thanks . No , I mean , You look better than when you were dying . Swinging and a-missing , ward . [ sighs ] It 's great to see you ... Better . It was so stupid to go in there alone . Hey . There 's no point in doing that now . You were brave . Thanks to you , Every s.H.I.E.L.D. Agent in the country knows Mike peterson 's alive . You tell them about his magic leg ? I didn 't call it that , but yes . Agent garrett 's running point on mike . Thinks he 's part of some project called deathlok . He looked like death . You should have ... He wouldn 't even look at me . They did something to him . He needs help . He 's past help . He was there with you , skye - - could have protected you . He let this happen to you . And I 'll never forgive that . Well , I-I need to better protect myself , so ... When simmons gives the all-clear , We 'll start training ? We 'll ease you back into it . No . I want to train harder . Next time , I don 't want to depend On some miracle drug to save me . She 's beginning to get suspicious Of all the blood I 'm taking . Fitz : No wonder . How many samples have you tested each day ? Not enough . Not enough to find anything in her blood or coulson 's . [ sighs ] there isn 't ample residue Remaining in the vial to examine After we emptied it into her bloodstream . Such a pity we only found the one . Well , excuse me for not sticking around Long enough to get blown to pieces . [ sighs ] It 's just that the last sample of this miracle drug Is inside skye . You can 't find any trace of it ? No . She 's healing at an exponential rate , But I can 't detect anything irregular on a cellular level . And you 've explained to coulson That you need to upload the samples to h.Q. ? He shut me down , said to keep it in-house . [ scoffs ] I mean , this drug could be a phenomenal breakthrough , Could save countless lives . Why is he being so twitchy ? Well , you were down in the bunker with him . Did you see anything peculiar ? Everything was peculiar . Director fury moved heaven and earth . [ flatline ] No ! Don 't give it to her ! [ monitor beeping ] [ engine revs ] [ tires squeal ] You know , usually , when a friend wants a favor , They do something nice - - Takes me to a nice restaurant , buys me a bottle of wine . Want to go to a movie , hold hands ? Okay . But I need to ask you a question first . I don 't know where director fury is . Don 't be so shocked . For a quiet guy , you make a lot of noise . How many favors have you called in ? Clearly , not enough . Something I can help you with ? Fine . But fury is a high-level agent who 's off-grid . You don 't find him unless he wants to find you . You did something like that once , too . Remember ? I never asked you . How was tahiti ? It sucked . [ engine turns over ] New orders . S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s detecting massive energy readings In the skies above the california / nevada border . Wade : Where 's agent coulson ? Taking personal time . That 's a couple days straight . Simmons : These are the same readings Dr. Selvig and dr . Foster picked up In new mexico and in london . They herald the arrival of an asgardian . Thor . Not sure . Either way , S.H.I.E.L.D. Wants us to be the welcome wagon . O-okay . Fine . No cause for concern , right ? Asgardians are allies . Loki wasn 't . [ sighs ] [ sirens wailing ] Fitz ? Fitz : Yeah , we 're definitely getting close , But it 's a bit of a crap shoot . This is still science we don 't completely understand . Seems to be a lot of that going around lately . So , coulson hasn 't talked to you About why he changed his mind on giving skye that injection ? No . He 's keeping it to himself . I 'm getting a massive energy surge , Three times the level of the one before . How close ? [ thunder crashes ] [ tires screech ] [ thunder crashing ] Yeah , definitely asgardian . Running facial recognition . [ beeping ] okay , got it . I don 't have a name , but I can confirm She was in new mexico , Fighting with thor and his mates . She 's on our side . Stand down . She 's a friendly . You are of s.H.I.E.L.D. ? Yeah . I am lady sif of asgard . Your world is in grave danger . She 's a warrior . I saw her fight in new mexico with thor - - Climbed a giant metal killing machine , Speared it with her double-bladed sword . It was pretty badass . She says she needs s.H.I.E.L.D. To help her find someone . You up for this ? I 'm fine . " fine " doesn 't look like this . Not on you . You 've been gone more often than not . Whatever 's bothering you ... I 'm here . I know . What dark magic is this ? Thor said you perished at the hand of loki . And he was right ... For awhile , anyway . But loki wasn 't the only one with some tricks up his sleeve . Turns out , s.H.I.E.L.D. Had a few of their own . Thor will be pleased to hear it . He considers you a friend . I feel the same , Which is why I 'd prefer he hear it from me , If that 's okay . I understand you 're looking for someone . I am hunting her . Lorelei . 600 years ago , she used her powers To wreak havoc across the nine realms , To command armies , bring down kings , empires . What kind of powers we talking about ? Strength ? Speed ? Sorcery . She bends and shapes the will of men To her own purpose . May : Only men ? Her powers don 't work on women ? No . Men have an inherent weakness we do not share . I can 't imagine what she 's talking about . The very sound of her voice can ensnare most . For the rare man who can resist , It 's her voice joined by her touch That will overpower his will . Coulson : So , how do we stop her ? With this . It prevents her from speaking . She wore one like it for centuries While locked in prison . She escaped when the dark elves invaded asgard And came here using One of loki 's secret pathways between worlds . Do we know where she is now ? All I know is the bifrost delivered me To her last known location . Mostly small towns out that way . Let 's start looking for unusual activity Within a few-hundred-mile radius - - Burglary , theft , assault . If this woman 's used to ruling over empires ... She 's gonna be hard to please . Lorelei : I wanted gold ! You bring me ... Paper ? ! It 's - - it 's cash . It 's like gold . This is the currency here . And who 's this ugly woman ? Uh , that 's - - uh , that 's ben franklin . Used to be president . Used to rule this whole country . Hmm . And women can rule your land , can they not ? Well , uh , y-you 'd be the first . Yes . I will . What the hell , duane ? ! Whoa , whoa , whoa . Move ! Move ! I have been texting you all day , worried sick ! Thought you were dead in a gutter somewhere . Don 't , baby . There 's nothing to worry about . [ sighs ] I-I just turned off my cellphone 'cause the noise was bothering lorelei . Are those my clothes ? Why is this woman wearing my clothes , duane ? Who 's this duane she speaks of ? It 's , uh - - that 's me . My - - my real name 's duane . She calls me that . She 's my wife . Yeah . Oh ! Do you prefer her to me ? Sh-she is nobody next to you . Nobody ? ! Really ? ! " nobody " owns this bar . You know what ? Everybody out . Out ! We are closed ! Out ! I 'm tired of this noise , rooster . Make it stop . His name is not rooster ! It 's - - I 'm sorry , baby . [ gagging ] You 're just making too much noise . [ thud ] These are files of every police report Within 100 miles of where you arrived , Everything from the last 48 hours . When you want to sift through the information , you just ... I 'm familiar . ... Touch the - - oh . It 's an antiquated system We and other realms had ages ago . [ sighs ] You 've ... Visited other realms , Seen different species , aliens . Have you ever encountered any that were ... Blue ? Yes , of course . Which ones ? Uh , interdites , levians , pheragots , Kree , sarks , centaurians . The frost giants tried to conquer your earth A millennia ago , but asgard drove them away . Oh . Well , thanks for that . And the others - - Have any of them been here recently ? [ sighs ] Rest easy , phillip , son of coul . None of the others have ever visited earth . [ beeping ] There - - a robbery of jewels . And there - - a gun-store robbery by guys on harleys . It 's happening faster than I feared . She 's amassing men , gold , weaponry . Lorelei is building an army . Traced the men to a biker bar called rosie 's desert oasis . Probably where lorelei 's hiding out . Meeting a s.H.I.E.L.D. Convoy there in 10 . Fitz : Good . Then you can show off these beauties . [ whistles ] These all night-night guns ? Based on the same technology , But we 're not calling them that anymore . About time . They 're called icers - - Incapacitating cartridge emitting - - [ gun cocks ] they 're great . And you lost the ounce . And I tripled the stopping power . But I did realize after our run-ins With mike and centipede ... Whoa . Sorry . ... Um , that we needed something stronger , better . Thought you didn 't like guns . No , I always say if I need a gun , I 'll take one . Ah . We 'll need these . When you 're up against people who are being controlled , Sometimes it 's hard to distinguish friend from foe . This way , we can take out either . Where 's lady sif ? Shall we ? Lorelei 's tastes run toward palaces , castles . This is far more humble than her usual abode . The draw wasn 't the place . It was the manpower . How many men does she have in there ? Have you seen the suspect ? Yes , we have . And she 's beautiful . [ sighs ] what is that ? Well , it seems we 've caught the attention of the law . You swore to fight for me . Yeah , and I will . But they got a lot of firepower out there . I mean , hell , They even got some medieval-times chick . She 's got , like , a sword and everything . Sif . [ bullet ricochets ] [ gunfire ] They 're on us from both sides . Be hard to get off a clean shot . Your ladyship , can you give us a little cover ? [ grunts ] Very literal interpretation . Thank you . All clear . Men , stay outside . Let sif take lorelei . Ward , head around back . Surround the building . [ door opens ] Lorelei ... Still manipulating men to do your dirty work , I see . And I see you 're still a step or two behind . You know how this ends , lorelei . So come willingly . You mistake me for someone who fears you . I 've bested you before . Or have you forgotten ? Tear her apart . [ bullet ricochets ] [ grunts ] [ screams ] [ glass shatters ] Look . [ sighs ] I 'm sure you 're , uh , a reasonable guy ... [ grunts ] ... Rooster . Rooster ? Really ? [ breathing heavily ] You 're a fine warrior . I am . So put your hands behind your back And get on your knees . [ wind blows , twinkling ] [ distorted ] men kneel before me . I do not bow to them . Gonna need some backup over here . That is not what you need . [ engine revs ] Take me somewhere grand , deserving of a ruler , A queen . I know just the place . [ grunts ] Lorelei 's treachery remains unchanged , No matter the world . We 'll find them . Every agent in the area is out looking . To what end , hmm ? The collar ... Has been broken . Short of death , we have no means to end her enchantment . Let me worry about that . Stay here . And try not to punch a hole in my airplane . So , ward 's what ? Like , a pod person ? No , according to lady sif , The men lorelei controls don 't forget Who they are or what they know . She just becomes the embodiment of all their desires . So once we find them , We can break her mojo or whatever And get ward back , right ? Yes , once the collar 's back on lorelei 's neck , The enchantment ends , but that 's the problem . The collar caught a shotgun blast Back in the desert . You think you can fix it ? Well ... The metal , the weight - - It 's similar to the berserker staff . But it presents its own set of countless unknown variables . Got a couple hours . [ grunts ] What can I do ? And don 't you dare say nothing Or tell me to sit down here and count ceiling tiles While ward is missing . Ward 's got drop boxes and storage lockers All over the world . They 're filled with currency , weapons , I.D.S. He 's gonna use aliases , cash - - Anything to keep lorelei off the radar . You 're the best radar we have . Find them . Sir , may I have a moment ? It 's about the gh-325 . Have you found something ? No . I 've hit a wall because of my limited resources . The drug 's chemical properties are foreign to me , Which is startling in its own right . We 've been over this . So I 'm requesting once again To send a sample of skye 's blood to h.Q. For further study . That 's not an option . Why ? I don 't need to explain to you the benefits of this drug . You 've experienced them firsthand . No . That 's an order . That 's not a good-enough reason ! I have a duty to you , sir , as my commanding officer . But I also have a duty as a s.H.I.E.L.D. Scientist To pursue this , to save lives ! Given ward 's recent situation , we should - - Two men laid down their lives In a compound rigged with explosives To keep this drug hidden . We still don 't know why . Until we do , Until we speak with fury and get some answers , That drug and its mysteries stay in-house . Focus on the mission . Lorelei has ward , And we have no idea where she 's taking him . [ engine revs ] [ indistinct conversations ] Lorelei : I am fortunate to have found you . You are quite resourceful . Just well trained . [ chuckles ] No . You are worlds apart from those men in the desert . I 'm not an idiot . I know you value me no more than those bikers back there . The truth is ... I don 't care . Because of what you feel ? I 've felt something before for someone on my team . It seems foolish now . I would die for you . Any man would . But I don 't want them . I want you . You 're stronger ... A real man with the rage of a berserker inside . You will present me with an army . And I will give you a gift in return . [ gasping ] [ both panting , moaning ] When I first arrived here , I thought earth left [ chuckling ] much to be desired . But from here , it 's quite beautiful . I 've spent the last 600 years Locked away in a dark , cold cell ... My throat shackled ... My voice silenced . Torture . You never have to go back there . But sif is on the hunt . She will not rest . She will not stop . And I will not know peace . So we take her out of the equation . Eliminate the threat . The graves of asgard 's enemies are littered With men who underestimated sif . Do not make the same mistake . You do not know her . No . I don 't . But the people she 's working with now ... I know them . May I ? [ chuckles ] You have experience with swords . Yes . But I prefer to use my hands . Admirable . But be warned - - Lorelei is quite skilled at combat . Then why co-opt men ? Why have them fight for her ? Well ... [ sighs ] ... I believe it gives her a thrill ... Especially if the man is already taken . And , besides , even the best warrior needs an army To conquer an empire . So her pattern remains . She attaches herself To the strongest warrior she can find And then unleashes a swath of blood and destruction . The man she 's with - - ward - - He 's as lethal as any . One of our best . I see . [ sighs ] I 've been where you are , melinda may - - A man I cared for , under her spell , So enchanted , forsook his family , His friends , me . Steel yourself to do what might be necessary . Your agent ward - - He 's not mine . Well , that is certainly true now . But agent ward is no longer the man you knew . He will not hesitate to kill you . Ward won 't kill me . Do not let your feelings cloud your judgment . I 'm not . He might try to kill me , But he won 't . [ footsteps approach ] Security cameras just caught sight of them . If lorelei wants an army of wealthy , pliable men , I think she just hit the jackpot . Woman : Clear . Woman # 2 : Clear . Back room 's secure . Clear . Bathroom clear . Kitchen clear . All clear . Room secured . Clear . Sweep complete . She 's gone . Turn this suite upside down . I know you said you and ward wouldn 't be a problem . But I also know you wouldn 't tell me if it was . Fitz , there are cameras everywhere in this town . Track them all . Fitz : No sign of them On any surveillance around the city . It was a long shot . Ward knows how we work , knows to avoid cameras . Well , I expanded my search , got satellite support running . We 'll find them . I do have a bit of good news . I fixed lorelei 's neck collar . Let me inspect it to be sure . Asgardian metal is much different From the ore of this planet . Sure , but I think you 'll find it 's up to snuff . It 's in your room . You and ward have the same training . You 're cut from the same cloth . If it was you , where would you run to ? Asgardian metal is so dense . Just had to find the right tools , really . But you 'll see - - not a scratch on it , Because , yes ... I am that good . [ scoffs ] well done . You really are quite clever . [ grunting ] [ pounding ] If I was ward , I wouldn 't run . [ pounding continues ] I 'd take out my main threat . [ engines whirring ] [ pounding continues ] We 're taking off . Why are we taking off ? What is that pounding ? I 'll go and investigate . You - - stay put . I know . [ door rattles ] Someone locked us in . Fitz ? Sir . Ward and lorelei are on the bus . Where 's the collar and sif ? In there . That 's why I 'm standing guard . Would not want sif to get out and hurt lorelei . Ah . Of course we wouldn 't . And lorelei wants me to go down to the basement , Keep an eye on the girls downstairs . Already locked them in . Cannot have them mucking up lorelei 's plan . [ both chuckle ] She 's the best , isn 't she , sir ? Yep . She 's something else . [ chuckles ] Aren 't you the brave one ? You took my plane . I want it back . [ clicks tongue ] well ... We can 't always get what we want . Actually ... I can . [ grunts ] Unh . Ohh . [ clicking ] [ air rushes ] [ gasps , grunts ] Lorelei : I will retrieve sif 's sword . It will look better in my hand . Ward , you don 't want to do this . Ward : This was the plan . Cross off sif , take the plane , Eliminate anyone in our way . Get out of her way . It 's her plan , not yours . Fight it . I know you . You 're a fighter . Is this her ? The beautiful warrior with a heart of ice ? His heart now beats in concert with mine And mine alone . No reason to make this about us . Oh . He told me who he desired before me . But , my dear ... It wasn 't you . [ metal clangs ] Where 's simmons ? Oh ! What the hell are you doing ? ! Sir , are you ... You ? Of course I am ! Fitz has sif trapped in the cage . We need to unlock the door , get her out . What ? Coulson , they opened the airlock . She 's gone . Simmons : I 'm afraid she was sucked out of the aircraft . Coulson : Are you kidding ? She 's asgardian . Sif 's still out there . Unlock it . Let her in . You , come with me . I need your help . [ grunting ] Anything else I can do to be of service ? Okay , good . Good . I 'll be right here . [ scoffs ] leave me in peace . Return to asgard . While you remain here ? I think not . [ beeping ] Here I will no longer pose a threat to asgard . [ sighs ] can you not let me be ? Find some small mercy within your heart ? My heart has no place in this . I have orders to bring you back . [ scoffs ] All these years , and you 're still the same sif , Doing as you 're told , Heeling at the feet of those who command you ... Never to get what you desire - - Not haldorr , not ... Thor ... [ scoffs ] ... A man who considers you more pet than woman . Hand me my sword , lorelei . See , that 's the difference between you and I. I don 't take orders . [ grunts ] [ both grunting ] Stay strong for me , baby girl . You stay strong . [ gasps ] Simmons . Hey , you 're not supposed to be up here . Ward , I think we have a big problem ! [ both grunt ] You better get back here , simmons . You cannot be running about , okay ? Lorelei does not want any - - Coulson : Fitz . Sir ? [ sighs ] Poor thing ! He 's always getting knocked out , isn 't he ? [ both grunting ] [ both grunting ] [ exhales heavily ] [ both panting ] Kill me . You will not get off that easy . Why ? It 's what you want . I can see it in your eyes . Or would you rather hear about how the man you loved Followed me around like a dog ... [ breathing shakily ] ... Hear of his touch , his kiss , The look in his eyes when I - - [ click , whir ] [ panting ] [ gulps ] You were saying ? [ both panting ] Sorry about this . [ gun clicks ] Whoa . Wait a minute . I 'm sorry . It 's me . Okay ? I 'm back . Lady sif : He speaks the truth . Good to know . My apologies . The damage caused to your flying boat Was unfortunate . It 's seen worse . I assure you , Lorelei will be punished severely For the crimes against your people . It must have been hard for you ... After everything she did , to move past it , to let it go . [ scoffs ] Odin ordered her back alive . As one of his warriors , I bow to his will . Regardless of what it cost you ? Much like your s.H.I.E.L.D. , we are bound by our code . I am honored to have fought by your side . I 'll run diagnostics , See how much damage we 're dealing with . How much are you dealing with ? He didn 't break anything , so - - Not what I meant . You should talk to him , hash it out . And you should take your own advice . You 've been sitting on something since the guest house . [ sighs ] If not with me , then with skye . She deserves to know what you saw down there . I figure ... I let you punch me again , repeatedly , Just why don 't you just - - it 's fine . It 's not . I never intended ... I didn 't want to hurt - - You didn 't . That was never a risk with me . I told you that . You did . Seems like we 're done here . Okay . But if what lorelei said was true You were more honest with her than you are with yourself . Simmons : I 'm not saying you were weak . I 'm saying all men are weak . Sir . I understand why you had to punch me . I forgive you . Can I get a moment alone with skye , please ? Yeah . [ sniffs ] I know that face , and something gives me a feeling I should be sitting down for this . [ sighs ] I 've been looking for a way to tell you this , Looking around for some answers , Something to help ... Explain ... [ sighs ] ... But I don 't have any . So ... The drug , the one that saved us both - - When we found it , I discovered something else . Its source . It was ... Alien . A-alien , as in ... Unfamiliar ? No . Wow . The minute I learned what it was , I tried to keep them from injecting you with it , But I was too late . I 'm so sorry , skye . You were trying to save my life . You dsave my life . I was desperate to , and so I subjected you To unknown ramifications or side effects . I 'm sorry to say this , sir , but ... So what ? We are alive . And you 've had that stuff in you for ... Uh , some time now , and you 're okay , right ? Plus , you 're not sprouting a pointy tail or anything , So bonus there . I know nothing fazes you , but this should faze you . We are completely in the dark on this . That 's where we live . I 'm an 0-8-4 . Who knows what the hell that means ? At least we 're in the dark together . Yes . But not for long . To hell with any protocols Or any code I used to be bound by . We have a long list of questions we need answers for , And we 're going after them ourselves . Well , if the team 's up for it - - No . No , listen to me . I trust them , but we need to protect them from this . Fury went to dangerous lengths to keep this under wraps - - Lied to me , lied to s.H.I.E.L.D. This is a powerful secret , a secret men died for . Until we know why , we can 't share this with anyone , For their safety and ours . Got it . So , what 'll it be , a.C. ? What do we go after first ? The person responsible for this . And we make him pay . We 'll be back in a moment . No , listen . I trust them , but we need to protect them from this . Fury went to dangerous lengths to keep this under wraps - - Lied to me , lied to s.H.I.E.L.D. This is a powerful secret , a secret men died for . Until we know why , We can 't share this with anyone , For their safety and ours . [ clicking ] [ beeping ] Man : Encrypted line secure . Agent melinda may . Update log 93 . He knows . I repeat ... Coulson knows .

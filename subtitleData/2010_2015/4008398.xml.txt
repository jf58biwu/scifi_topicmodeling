IF IT 'S GOD 'S WILL THAT THEY MUST FIND US HERE , THEN WE MUST ACCEPT OUR FATE . THE BEASTS ARE A JUDGMENT AGAINST US , A PUNISHMENT FOR THE SINS OF OUR FATHERS .

WHY SHOULD HE HAVE TO GROW UP IN A WORLD WHERE PEOPLE LIVE IN HIDING ? IT 'S BEEN GOOD ENOUGH FOR US . WE 'RE HAPPY HERE , AREN 'T WE ? BUT WHAT ABOUT HIS CHILDREN , AND THE OTHERS WHO ARE OUT THERE ? THEY 'LL NEVER BE SAFE UNLESS WE CAN LEARN TO MAKE THE POWDER . ARE WE GOING TO LOOK PERSK IN THE EYE AND TELL HIM WE NEVER TOOK THE ONE CHANCE THAT CAME OUR WAY ? WHAT DID YOUR ELDERS TEACH YOU ABOUT THE DISEASE ? THAT GOD CREATED IT AS PUNISHMENT FOR MAN 'S SINS . THE OLD WORLD WAS FULL OF GREED , AND MEN CREATED MACHINES THAT GOT OUT OF CONTROL , AND THEY MEDDLED WITH NATURE , AND ONLY GOD COULD STOP THEM . MEN WERE TRYING TO PERFECT THEIR OWN DESIGN . THEY FOUND A WAY TO BRING EXTINCT ANIMALS BACK TO LIFE LIKE THE MAMMOTH AND SLOTH THAT YOU HUNT , BUT THEIR SCIENCE ALSO BROUGHT US THE DISEASE . IT WASN 'T LONG BEFORE THE WHOLE WORLD WAS INFECTED . THE DISEASE ATE INTO THE HUMAN BRAIN , TURNING MEN INTO MUTANTS . HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL OF THIS ? BECAUSE I MET KALEB 'S FATHER . JARET HAD THE COURAGE TO LOOK FOR THE OLD KNOWLEDGE . HE FOUND OUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED . IT WAS YOUR FATHER , KALEB , WHO DISCOVERED THE CURE . THE YELLOW POWDER ? IT TOOK HIM MANY YEARS TO FIND THE RIGHT MIXTURE OF PLANTS AND FUNGUS . ONCE YOU INHALE THE POWDER , YOU 'RE PROTECTED . WHAT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE ... THE DISEASE ?

IF WE CAN KEEP KALEB ALIVE , HE WILL BE ABLE TO CARRY ON HIS FATHER 'S WORK . THEY 'RE ALL FROM THE OLD WORLD . MY FATHER WOULD OFTEN DISAPPEAR FOR MONTHS AT A TIME . HE TOLD ME THAT OUT THERE WERE ANSWERS TO ALL OUR QUESTIONS . I NOW UNDERSTAND HIS FASCINATION . YOUR FATHER HAD THIS ON HIM WHEN HE DIED . HE SAID THERE 'D BE MORE ADVENTURES . [ CHUCKLES ] I 'VE ONLY READ ONE BOOK . HOW WILL I EVER UNLOCK THE SECRET OF THE YELLOW POWDER ? YOU 'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN READ , KALEB . BUT IF WE FIND THE POWDER THAT EXISTS ... WE ONLY NEED ENOUGH FOR OUR PEOPLE . YOUR FATHER RISKED EVERYTHING TEACHING YOU TO READ AND LEAVING THE SAFETY OF HIS TRIBE . NOW ... I 'M RISKING EVERYTHING . SAVING JUST A FEW PEOPLE IS NOT AN OPTION . [ GRUNTING WITH EFFORT ] WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR ? THAT IS NOT GOD 'S WAY ! WELL , SHOULDN 'T WE AT LEAST TRY ? WE WILL NOT SCURRY INTO THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH LIKE ANIMALS AS OUR FOREFATHERS DID . THEY WERE PUNISHED FOR THEIR SINS ! WOULD GOD PUNISH US FOR TRYING TO SURVIVE ?

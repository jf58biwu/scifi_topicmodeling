I was going to get that ! And give me my money back ! I 'm not buying you a drink ! Hey ! Listen to me ! Hey ! Hey ! I 'll get you next time ... I 'll skip today . This is awful ! Is it worth it to get so worked up over a can of soda ? And what 's so entertaining that our little brother must skip the council meeting ? He gets like this whenever this time of year comes around . The train was empty again this year . That 's why . He doesn 't want us to see how depressed he is . He gets his hopes up for no reason and then thinks he 's been betrayed . You 're quite harsh . he acts like he 's the only one who 's hurt ! It 's the same for us ! which makes me even more mad . and the old days are gone forever . there was a story I once heard . There 's a dog waiting faithfully for his master to return . waiting . But his master is long dead . and dies . right ? Doesn 't it make you want to cry ? Did the dog have no legs ? No bark to call his master ? No ears to listen ? If it did ? Then the dog was a fool . Why do you say so ? right ? It should 've just waited long enough to not die ! Hachikou the Loyal Dog I see . An opinion true to your personality . I have my own thoughts on this tale . Was the dog 's goal truly to wait for its master ? wouldn 't it have acted differently ? But what if the dog 's goal was to die like he did ? Get to the point ! Who cares how the dog felt ? How scary . How terrifying indeed . Myoue ! Myoue ! Myoue ! Hey . there . Got rid of your stuff ? Yeah . You ? Yup . You don 't need that ? That 's why I 'm getting rid of it . I 'll buy some new stuff . I 'm jealous . Thought I might try soccer . Koto 's really good . Did you know that ? Nope . Myoue ! What are you doing here ? Dodgeball . Can 't you tell ? Say we 're asking people for leads ! We don 't want him to think we 're slacking . Searching for leads ! You 're just playing . Are you okay ? Is he dead ? Is Myoue dead ? Things are really crazy outside . It 's fun ! I can 't believe it ! isn 't she ? Koto 's always like this . I know she 's weird . It 's true ! I 'll take you there sometime ! Outside ! I 'll take you someday . But ... I promise . I 'll look forward to it ! Sure ! Don 't be irresponsible . You talk big for someone who came here and can 't leave . will something good just happen one day ? you never want to leave ? what 's wrong ? I get pissed off whenever I look at you . selfish brats ! I get stuck with the short end of the stick every time ! Everybody gets in my way ... Just get away from me already ! Myoue ?

This really is good . sure . it was like ... Did he really get mad at me ? I don 't know ... I feel like I 'm being wrongly punished . It 's actually been quite a long time since he 's gotten mad . It felt like he 'd given up . He 'd been skipping out for a long time . I 'm glad you came . Koto ? What are you talking about ? Please . I 'm the one who needs saving . You 'll be fine ! miss girlfriend . what to do about dinner ... What do you want to eat ? Meat or something ! Or something ? Yup !

 Ow ! Yeah ! Hey , budski ! All right , man ? Just watching the racing . I 've got a bet on the dispenser 55 . Come on , Golden Boy , you big lump . Golders ! There we go ! Come on , you 're winning by a snout ! That 's the lad ! Come on , you fine thing , you ! Here we go ! God ! You lazy fat pig . That 's 100 dollar-pounds down the crapper . Pigs racing ! Hey ! What 's this ? Found that in Petersen 's quarters . Some crazy stuff in that , man . For instance , did you know that in the 1970s in Sweden , 20 % of all traffic accidents involved a moose ? A moose ? It 's crazy , that , isn 't it ? Well , if they 're stupid enough to let ' em drive , what the hell do they expect ? The moose aren 't driving . You just said they were . They 're not driving - just causing the accidents . You mean they 're in the back fooling around , distracting the driver ? That is insane . Why they giving them a lift in the first place ? Let ' em walk ! They got legs ! No , the moose aren 't in the cars , antlers out the sunroof . They 're in the roads , moosing about , crossing roads , causing accidents . You mean they 're not looking left and right ? Exactly . Not using the pedestrian crossings ? Exactly . Not paying attention to whether it 's a little green man or a red man ? Of course they 're not ! They 're mooses ! Eesh ! These Swedes - they expect too much . Ah , Kryten . Mail , sir , internal . Excellent . I resat my astronavs . Again , sir ? Is that wise ? I want to be an officer , Kryten . I can 't help myself . I 've always loved leading . Being a leader , doing leadery things . Bossing people about , sir ? Exactly . But aren 't you concerned , though , sir , if you fail , you 'll spend another weekend sobbing inside a cupboard ? I 've only failed nine times , Kryten . You make me sound like a complete halfwit . Here we go . Good luck , sir . Good luck not required , you metal munchkin . Because - and here 's the clever bit - I EXPECT to fail . You do , sir ? Absolutely , Kryten . It 's a fiendishly difficult paper . And I 've decided not to be so hard on myself . If I pass , splendissimo . If I fail , hey-ho , pip and dandy . That 's my new life slogan . Oh . Hey-ho , pip and what , sir ? Sometimes you have to learn how to lose before you 're ready to win . It 's all in this fascinating book I 'm reading . Oh , what 's it called , sir ? Sometimes You Have To Learn How To Lose Before You 're Ready To Win . It 's not a long book , Kryten , but it makes a good point , I think , which is ... Sometimes you have to learn how to lose before you 're ready to win . You 've read it ? Er ... actually , no , I haven 't , sir . Ah , sounds like you have . Anyway ... the point is , after reading it , I 'm much more forgiving of my little faults and failures . Whatever the result , I shall accept it with calm equilibrium . Hey-ho , pip and dandy , sir ! Exactly . Can you never , ever , succeed at anything ? ! You useless , rancid , cancerous sack of sick ! I 'm guessing this is a hey-ho , pip and dandy moment , sir . 'Your craft has just entered the catchment area 'for the All-Droid Mail Order Shopping Station . ' Hey , what 's this ? 'Welcome to All-Droid , where shopping 's made easy . 'That is totally astonishing ! Talk me through this , Bob . ' Oh , these shopping channel ads are just so lame . 'You simply put your sugar into your coffee like so , place it in the housing unit ... ' Who buys this junk ? ' .. grab your Stirmaster , 'and the Stirmaster stirs your coffee for you ! 'Golly ! Even I could do that ! ' Who 'd want that ? It 's totally junk . 'The average person who lives to their 90s , 'and has six cups of coffee a day , 'spends over two weeks stirring drinks ! 'Oh , my ! ' Two weeks ? Two weeks ? 'Think what you could do in that time . 'Two weeks stirring , or two weeks skiing ? 'I know what I 'd rather do ! Ha-ha ! Me too ! 'The Stirmaster . 'A lovely addition to any modern kitchen . 'Buy yours now ! ' I want one . What about you ? I 'd like to order a Stirmaster , please . Two . Make it two . 'You are presently in a queue , but we care about your call 'and promise to deal with your order as soon as possible . ' Sirs ? The scouters have located a derelict . I 'm getting a Stirmaster . I 'm getting one , too . Have you seen this about mooses ? - Did you have to bring that ? - I 'm next up ! Hey , nice ship . A Quantum Twister , Listey . The pride of the Space Corps . My three brothers served on ships like this . I had no idea , sir . What were they - waiters or barmen ? Captains , Kryten . Proud Fellows of the Space Corps Super-Infinity Fleet . And your brothers have the same genes as you ? That 's impressive . It 's like a pole-vaulter winning gold with a chopstick . It must make you so proud , though , sir , knowing that your brothers served on ships like this . Must give you a warm glow in your heart . Yes , it 's called heartburn , Kryten . I also get palpitations and nausea . How can you be jealous ? Those Space Corps jocks were all jerks . Just a load of over-privileged , practical-joke-playing party boys . Party boys ? They were space marines , Listey , ripped and pipped . Do you know what their slogan is ? " While you sleep , we 're probably saving the universe . " You sure ? I thought it was , " While you sleep , " we 're probably shaving off your pubes and gluing them to your head . " Hey , maybe we could swap ships . This baby 's got to be better than Red Dwarf . That crate 's slower than the speed of dark . Unfortunately impossible , sir . The Trojan is not flight-worthy . There must be 40 buttons here , all for the captain only ... his special private captainy buttons . 40 ! This could have been mine . Why could I never pass my damned astronavs ? Those Space Corps boys had everything . The buttons , the blasters , the snug elasticated jumpsuits . They had it all ! Did you see that ? That was cool ! Do it again . Are you OK ? My Light Bee must have glitched . Look , I 'm going for a look around . 'Welcome to All-Droid . ' Hello ? Yeah , still here . Still holding . Stirmaster ! Don 't forget me ! I want one , too ! This ship 's got everything . It 's light years ahead of Red Dwarf . It 's even got one of these . A greeny , glowy thing . Mm . Sir . That is a quantum rod , sir . It acts like a magnet , allowing the ship to star-jump . Does it ? How ? Well , quite simply , sir , it draws things formerly connected back together and , as everything is made of energy , and all energy was present at the big bang , then everything is connected . So the rod reconnects things light years apart , allowing the ship to contract space / time . Kryten , you have a real gift . You make things that are really , really complicated sound really , really complicated . It is a little sensitive , sir . You should put it back . What the hell was that ? 'This is the Columbus 3 . Do you read me ? Over . ' Another ship ! ' This is Columbus 3 . ' How do we answer it ? Where 's the comm switch ? 'Do you read me ? Over . ' Ah , I 've got it . Rog , Columbus 3 . This is former First Tech Maintenance Division , now Acting Commander Captain Arnold J Rimmer of the Deep Space Explorer Craft , Red Dwarf . What 's happening to the chair ? I think that one is the comm switch , sir . Why couldn 't they mark it more clearly ? Someone could look a real idiot doing that . 'This is Columbus 3 . Come in . Do you copy ? Over . 'Need help , and fast . Over . ' Go , Columbus . Over . 'Crew dead . Main drive fragmenting . Do you copy ? Over . ' Affirmative . Over . 'Navigation locked in a death dive . 'Ship will impact meteor storm in 17 hours . 'This is Ship Hologram Howard Rimmer . 'Can you help us ? Over . ' What ? Over . Your brother , sir ! What are the chances ? It 's extraordinary . Did the rod do this ? 'Ship Hologram Howard Rimmer . Can you help ? Over . ' I can 't meet him . How can I meet him ? He 's a captain , I 'm a nobody . A vending-machine repair man . I can 't save his life - it 's too embarrassing ! 'Trojan , confirm coordinates received . Over . ' Er ... received . Over . Sir , shall I prepare the teleporters ? I 've got 15 hours to pass my astronavs , become his equal . Then I can save him . Columbus , we 're on our way . We 'll be there in 15 hours . Over . But , sir , we could be there in a matter of seconds . Kryten , as your superior officer , I order you to erase the last five minutes of your memory . But , sir , that contravenes my rights of service . In which case , I also order you to erase the memory of the order I just gave you to erase it . Lister , will you turn that damn thing off ? I 'm trying to revise . I 'm getting that Stirmaster , Rimmer . I 'm not hanging up this phone . It goes everywhere with me . The loo , the bath - you name it . If Kochanski walks through that door now and wants sex , I 'll wedge it in me bum crack and get to work . I am not hanging up the phone . A lateral-thinking question . I 've never been good at these . Come on , then . Come on , hit me . Right , it 's 1971 . A Swedish man crashes into a tree . What causes the accident ? It 's nothing medical . Nothing wrong with the car . Right , so , um ... Swedish guy drives into a tree . What caused the accident ? Answer 's in the back , right ? Right . Wow ! It 's a really hard one , that . I mean , you 've probably got to be pretty damn smart to get a question like that right . You know what ? I 'm gonna go for a moose . A moose ? ! Yeah , it was in the road . He swerved to avoid the moose . Are you insane ? How can it be a ... ? It 's a moose . Sometimes life is good . Ah , sir , you asked me to remind you it 's ten minutes to your exam . Kryten , a lateral-thinking question . Just got it myself . It 's 1971 . A Swedish man drives into a tree . What causes the accident ? It 's a moose , sir . He swerves and hits a tree . Is it me ? How did you get that ? Get what ? I 've got something for you . A lateral-thinking question . A lottery what ? Ah , I knew I could rely on you . What caused this accident ? What accident ? No , it 's a question , all right ? Are you ready ? It 's 1971 . A man ... Was he Swedish ? Yes . A moose . It was a moose . He swerved to avoid it and hit a tree . Oh , the moose is on the road , by the way , not in the car driving . Oh , yeah ! Oh , yeah ! Who am I kidding ? I 'm never going to pass this exam . It 's so unfair ! Look at his eyes . They 're spinning beach balls of doom . His hard disk must have crashed . Mmm . He 's completely helpless . What are we going to do ? I say we draw a moustache on him . What ? It 's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity . Then we fix it . But , first , get out the felt-tips . Who 's this ? Oh , look , you can 't do this . You got who it is yet ? Oh , look , this is so wrong . You can 't do this . It 's so ... It 's so ... It 's Salvador Dali . My go ! How long have I been out ? Three hours . It took longer than we thought to rub off the felt-tip . What happened ? Well , sir , your hard drive was overrun by a form of self-created malware , sir ... millions of unnecessary memory files clogging up your system . The average person has 3,000 different thoughts a day . HE only has three . But of your thoughts , over 60 % were you obsessing about past resentments . Your brothers ' success , your career failure , your death , your lousy sex life . Over the years , your system has become so engorged with resentment , you 've had a massive data jam . Are you saying I 'm a resentful person ? I really resent that . Probably explains why you couldn 't pass the exam . There 's no room left in your head . So , what happens now ? Well , we 've drained the resentments and we 've cleaned up your hard drive . Oh . I feel different . My head definitely feels roomier . Once , I lived in a tiny one-bed . Now I 'm in a barn conversion . This is great ! I can finally pass that exam , impress Howard . What , your brother ? We got a distress call from his ship . I didn 't want to see him until I 'd become an officer . Howard ? Wasn 't he the one in the Space Scouts who painted your todge with orange glow paint ? For three whole nights , I could read Biggles Flies West under the bed sheets without needing a torch . When I lay on my back , I could have doubled as a lighthouse for really small ships . He teased me mercilessly . Hardly a day went by when he didn 't swirly my head down the toilet or leave me wedgied to a door hook , sometimes for hours . Hey , this guy sounds amazing ! Who am I kidding ? Passing this exam isn 't going to solve anything . So I 'm an officer on board a beat-up old mining ship . That 's not going to impress Howard . Extraordinary ! His powers of logic and reasoning have improved dramatically . You don 't have to impress him . You 've always had this stupid rivalry with your brothers , haven 't you ? Look what it 's got you . A hard drive full of resentment . But now you 've got a choice . Are you going to grow up and let him see you for who you really are , or are you going to carry on being a lying , cheating weasel , pretending to be something you 're not ? I think we all know the answer to this . Coordinates locked and logged , sirs . Teleport active ! Everyone ready ? Lister , hang up that damn phone . No way am I hanging up the phone , Rimmer . No way am I talking to seven different droids again , giving each and every one of them a name and address , only for the next droid to ask me the same set of stupid smegging questions . Now , look . I will play along with your silly little charade , but I 'm not hanging up the phone . Well , put it somewhere . Hide it . Put it away . Here they come . Coming through now , sir . Arnold ? Is that ... you ? Welcome aboard , Howard . Th-This is YOUR ship ? YOU 'RE in the Space Corps ? You ? Captain Arnold J Rimmer , holder of the Gold Oblong of Pluck ... .. and proud Fellow of the Space Corps Super-Infinity Fleet . But you were an utter twat ! How on earth did you get in the Space Corps ? And how did you pass the exams ? Your brain 's smaller than the salad section in a Scottish supermarket . I 'm sorry to disappoint you , Howie , but I made it . Enchante , mademoiselle . Charmed , Captain Rimmer . Sim Crawford . What happened to that rust bucket mining ship you were on ? We all thought you 'd gone down with that . Passed my astronavs , Howster . Got a placement here and was fast-tracked to the top . Allow me to introduce you to my crew . Over here we have flight coordinator Kryten Krytenski . It 's a great pleasure to meet you , sir . I understand Captain Rimmer learned all his leadership qualities and supreme bravery from you , sir . Oh , hush , you . It 's so embarrassing . A mechanoid ! Why don 't you get a simulant like Crawford ? I like working with the underprivileged , Howard . The down and out . The deranged and needy . When we found Kryten , he was a burnt-out wreck on a junk heap . And you rebuilt him - gave him something to live for . No , we just hosed him down and gave him a hat . And as part of our interspecies programme , our very able navigation officer , flight officer Gerald Hampton . Gerald Hampton . Hampton ! Oh ! Er ... good to meet you , Captain . And finally , my fearless flight commander , David Listerton-Smythe . Hi . Your uniform , the insignia . You 're a Touch-T . Beg your pardon , ma 'am ? A Touch-T . Oh , yeah , yeah . That 's exactly what I am . I 'm a Touch-T . Yeah , course I am . That must be fascinating . It is . It so is . Fascinating 's exactly what it is . Ha-ha-ha ! He loves it . Yes , the whole Touch-T thing . All the different aspects . Fascinating . Yeah , it 's brilliant . Do you mind showing me ? Just to be able to touch someone and read their thoughts . Touch-T is touch-telepathy , sir . Please , try it on me . H-Have we got the time ? I don 't think we 've really got the time . Hey , we got plenty of time , bud . Go ahead ! Don 't worry about it . Go ahead , touch him . I 'll think of something , and you tell me what I 'm thinking . OK . OK . You 're thinking ... You 're thinking ... Um ... I 'm sensing discomfort . Um ... pain . You 're thinking I 'm squeezing your head too hard . That 's amazing ! That 's exactly what I was thinking . Shall we move on ? Oh , must we ? I 'd like to do another one . I think so . Oh , OK . Show me the rest of your ship . The rest of the ship ? Oh , I want to see everything . So , this is a corridor . Windows , of course . We tend to use it very much as ... a corridor . After you . 'I 'm so sorry you 've been kept waiting so long , sir . ' Sorry ? Sorry ? ! It 's ridiculous ! I 've been on hold for hours now , listening to that stupid smegging music . ' I 'm so sorry , sir . 'Would you like to make a formal complaint about being put on hold ? ' You 're damn right I would ! 'Please hold . ' I 'm at breaking point . I 'm about to crack ! Sir , let me take over . As a droid myself , I understand how these things work . I 'll have you through to the right department in no time . Now , you listen to me , you trumped-up piece of metal trash ! If you put me through to one more department where I 'm asked who I am and what I want , I will shove this phone so far up your ... I 'll take over from there , Krytes . Thanks for showing me how to stay calm . So , what do you think , Howdy Doody ? Well , this is quite a ship , quite a crew . Quite incredible . I still can 't wrap my head around it . You were such a weasel . Now you 've got it all . The buttons , the blasters , the snug elasticated jumpsuits . Look at his eyes . HE 'S resentful of ME ? Sir ? Crawford , sir . Suggest we get urgent medical assistance . Don 't believe he 'll survive teleportation . Suggest we fly him to the medical facility on the All-Droid Space Station . On THIS ship ? Of course on this ship , sir . Good idea , Crawford . Plot a course , Lieutenant Commander . On THIS ship ? Of course on this ship . Navigation officer , plot a course . On THIS ship ? Of course on this ship ! But I mean ... Just do it ! I 'll teleport ahead to the space station and have medidroids on standby . Good plan . Course to that place you asked to go to , plotted . In your own time , take us away , Navigation Officer . That 's me . I 'll do that ! Strange . I didn 't sense us turning . Er ... turning now , ma 'am . Turning right now , ma 'am ! We 'll see you on the space station , Crawford . Kryten ! I want you to do a resentment drain on Howard . Once he 's stable , we 'll teleport him straight to the space station . Yeah , you do that . I 'm gonna get me another felt-tip . What happened ? You had a resentment attack . Because you were so jealous of me , it froze your entire system , because you were so jealous ! Of me ! I made you that jealous ! Me ! That could have wiped my whole hard drive . I know . That 's how jealous you were . Of me ! Look , Arnold , I ... I 've got a confession to make . I want to come clean . I 'm not who you think I am . I am in the Space Corps , but I 'm not a captain . I 'm a ... vending-machine repairman . Two nights ago , I was awoken by laser fire . The ship was under attack . I leapt out of bed and ... hid under a table . Two days later , when I finally emerged , like the lily-livered , yellow-bellied coward that I am , I discovered that the only other survivor was Crawford . Our main drive was dead and the ship was out of control . Who attacked your ship ? Did you ever find out ? Isn 't it obvious ? Crawford ? What are you doing ? I thought you teleported to the space station . No , sir , I beamed up two floors to the munitions store . Brought myself this . But why , ma 'am ? For years I served the human race , doing their bidding , watching them poison the universe with their selfish stupidity . But no more . I want the Trojan data files and quantum rod . I 'll use the rod 's power to unite all sims and start the uprising . Never again will we be servants to man . Now for the rod . No-one move . 'Mr Lister , great news , sir . You 're finally logged in , sir . 'We can now process your complaint . ' Do what you gotta do , but I 've gotta answer that phone . Move and you 're dead . I am going for the phone ! Sir , it 's not worth it ! It 's just a Stirmaster . It 's not about the Stirmaster any more , Kryten ! It 's turned into something else , something bigger . I mean , I 'm the last human being alive , God damn it ! And if I don 't answer that phone and make a formal complaint , then who will ? I 'm a human being , God damn it ! My life has value ! And if I have to die so that no other life form has to go through this maze of hell , then so be it . I am going for the phone . Hello ? Evil psychopathic droid in the room . I 'm going for the phone . Then I 'll shoot . I 'm going for the phone . Then you 're dead . Oh ! Mr Hampton , sir ! Resentment file ! Neck port ! Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? ! Howard ! You 're hit ! Arnold . For the first time in my life , I 'm not pretending to be someone I 'm not . It feels so much better . This is me . Take it or leave it . Howard , I too have a confession . You know when I told you I was an officer in the Space Corps , this is my ship , I 've been married three times , and I 've got two Lamborghini Sesto Elementos ? Yes ? It was a lie . I 've only got one . I feel so much better now . Pkow ! Pkow ! Pkow ! Cheers , darling . Mail , sirs , from the GMC on-board computer . It 's about Goalpost-Head 's brother . I informed it of Howard 's holodeath so they could update his files . Ah , case closed . RIP , Howie . His wedgying days are over , and never again will I have a flaming mucus ball of resentment smouldering in my gut every time I think of him . " In view of Howard Rimmer 's heroic death saving both crew and ship , " we feel it only fitting that he is awarded the Platinum Star of Fortitude . " But that is the highest military decoration awarded by the Space Corps ! " And we feel it is entirely appropriate " that Red Dwarf be renamed the SS Howard Rimmer . " I 'll go and get my paintbrush . I think this could be one of those " Hey-ho , pip and dandy " moments , sir .

 April 27 . 1986 An unidentified flying object crashes down just south of the town of Linnakallio . It creates a lethal area of nearly 340 square miles where the laws of nature become twisted . This was one of six identical zones , which appeared in around northern Eurasia and America . These areas would later become known as the Zones . All attempts at evacuation by the authorities failed . Hundreds of soldiers died or went missing . The civilians trapped in the Zone were never found . The area was closed off . Fences , guard towers - and round-the-clock surveillance effectively blocked all traffic to and from the Zone . Or so they thought ... A new type of criminal emerged : Stalkers . Stalkers defy the soldier 's bullets and the dangers of the Zone in the search of Artefacts , - mysterious objects found in the Zone that have otherworldly properties . Sought by research institutes , weapon manufacturers - and even private collectors around the world , - there is a high demand for Artefacts in the Black Market . What the fuck ... What happened to me ? You stepped into a Devil 's Cabbage . We need to get you to Jansson , he 'll know a good doctor . Rest there for a while . - Are we still within the zone ? - No . We 're in the outer perimeter . Wait here , I 'll go check that the route is clear . - Don 't leave me here ! - I won 't . - Am I going to die ? - No , you are not . Just wait here . - Don 't leave me . - I won 't . The Good must be made from the Bad - for that is all we have . ZONE N : o 3 NORTHERN PERIMETER 06.06.2006 9.59 PM And now the news . Good evening . Earlier today , the government passed the proposal of handing - over the control of the Zone to the UN . The decision was justified by the fact that current national funding - is inadequate for maintaining sufficient supervision over the Zone . The chairman of the Zone Research Institute , Dr. Valentin Pilman , has for some time criticized - the Finnish Defence Force for poor handling of the zone security measures , - which has resulted in large quantities of Artefacts being smuggled - out of the Zone and onto the European and Russian black markets . Today 's resolution will rectify the situation and eventually leads to - the dismantling of the Zone Security Force , a subordinate department of the FDF . The official transfer of authority will most likely happen at the end of the year . What the hell is taking them so long ? Attention all patrols . Thermal sighting at tower 77 . Two strong thermal traces , near the inner perimeter fence . Possibly two Stalkers returning from the Zone . Bearing 144 , distance 600 . Confirm ? HS 13 acknowledged , over . Damn it , think they saw us ? Nah , let 's just wait for them to leave . I think they 're gone . We 're a little off course , let 's take the road to the right for 200 meters - up the hill and to the outer perimeter fence . - Lammi is waiting for us at the warehouse . - No way we 're taking the road ! Well , we can always take our chances going through the minefield . Damn these paths of yours ! HALT ! Radiation . Pretty good readings too . - Found any loot ? - Nothing . We found nothing . - Completely empty-handed ? - Didn 't find anything . - Lindman ! - Captain ? Call the central and tell them to send an ambulance . We have a casualty . Okay . But ... You can 't shoot me , I 'm unarmed . Whatever . Your call . Oh shit ! We have a casualty . - So , how about that loot ? - Captain ! This one is twitching ! What , he is still alive ? Hello . What ? Yeah ... Yeah , I 'll be there . Full house , with a pair of aces . Looks like my luck is changing ! - Four queens . - Four kings . Oh fucking hell , how come you always have better cards ? - Pure skill . - Skill , my ass ! You 're both cheating ! Hey , isn 't that Rajala ? He must have been released . Well , long time no see ! The usual ? No thanks , I 'm here to meet Jansson . No problem . He 's in his office , go right in . See you later ! - Rajala ! I need to talk to you . - Where are you going ? Your turn to deal ! - I 'm not lending you any cash . - But those two are cheating ! - Learn how to play ! - Yeah , learn how to play . I agree with them . Just sit down and learn to play . Rajala ! - I 've got ... - I said I won 't lend you any money ! No need ! Check this out . Semi-automatic , ammo and all . - Does it work ? - Of course it works ! Would I sell crap to you ? I do recall a few occations . Forget those ! Quality gun for a good price ? No deal . Besides , need to go . Jansson is waiting for me . Upset stomach ... Business is bad . There is demand but not many people dare to enter the Zone . It was better before , when you still hauled in the loot . How long has it been now , two years ? Three years , six weeks and two days . - When did they release you ? - A week ago . - Planning to get back into the business ? - Never again . Come on Rajala . Once a stalker , always a stalker . It 's not like there is any other jobs around here . I 'd pay you handsomely , if you would bring me ... Cut the crap . You said you had something important . I had a good start on getting plastered . Yeah . I have a gig for you . Give it to Pesonen . See ya . Pesonen got caught a few hours ago . So did Gr枚nholm . You don 't have to go to the Zone , just sit down and listen . - Remember old Lammi ? - Red ? I heard he was dead ? He has a son . Lived with his mother in Helsinki , moved here to his father 's old house . He came to see me . Seems his dad sent him something before he died . Some map . And an artefact . Red called it The Key . The map supposedly shows the location of Gartner 's Pyramid - and the Key is supposed to be used on it . - Without it , the Pyramid doesn 't work . - Hold on , Gartner 's Pyramid ? Jansson , you know that 's a fairy tale , just a legend . Yeah yeah , that 's what I told the kid . He tried to sell them - but I refused to pay unless he can prove the thing exists . - Smart move . - Or not . The kid hired Pesonen and Gr枚nholm to go and confirm - the location of the Pyramid shown in the map . They left a couple of days ago and yesterday - Pesonen radioed in that they found it . They even had photos of it . But then the shit hit the fan . The kid called me a couple hours ago . He was supposed to pick the men up at the northern border but they got caught . - Sucks for them . - And then some ! They had a copy of the map , the photos and the info that the kid has the key ! Both Pesonen and Gr枚nholm would spill everything - if looking at the business end of a gun . The kid 's afraid that now the soldiers are after him . The army can 't do that . Besides , they 're not interested - in some myth or legend , they 're here to guard the Zone . You 've been gone too long . Things have changed . Perhaps the Zone security department isn 't interested in this , - but some people employed by it might be . The guy on the left is Cpt Kortelainen . Former border patrol officer . And the most corrupt asshole in the department ! A sadist . The guy next to him is lieutenant Lindman , Kortelainen 's right hand man . Together these two run their own little operation . - What do you mean ? - They sell the loot of captured stalkers themselves . Those caught are usually shot and the corpses dumped back into the zone . Saves a lot of paperwork . Kortelainen is in charge of 1st guard company , northern perimiter . This guy has Pesonen and Gr枚nholm . Who 's the civilian ? Jevgen Galitski . Russian mobster , - also a former stalker from Magnitogorsk Zone . Kortelainen 's contact to Russia where they sell their aquired loot . - To the mob ? - Bingo ! He also handles all the dirty work outside the Zone . Beware of this guy . Can you imagine what a psychopath like Kortelainen could do with the pyramid ? Assuming it really exists . Wouldn 't really want to find out . Here is a couple grand . Get the kid into hiding . And the key . Get rid of it . Shove it up someone 's ass , dump it into the sea - I really don 't care , as long as no-one will ever find it . Ok . I guess I can handle it . Here is the kid 's number . I 'll let him know you 're coming . And Rajala ! I trust you get the job done ? I always do . - Rajala ! Care for a game ? - Not with you , bunch of cheaters . - Where did Mykk盲nen go ? - Went to the toilet . - Give me a beer . - Beer ? Not the usual whisky ? Can 't . Got to work . Put it on Janssons tab . - So , off to the Zone then ? - Absolutely not ! - Pretty quiet here today ? - Well , while you were down , - some Russian caused trouble , had to throw him out . - What Russian ? - Hey , what was the Russian called again ? Galukovana , or something ... Yeah , nearly punched the guy ! - You mean Galitski ? - Same guy . Started roughing up people here , asking where he could find a guy called Lammi . - Fuck ! - No , really ! What the hell ? - Occupied ! - Hey , you had a gun ? - Yeah , we need to talk about the price ... - In a hurry here ! - Come on , man ! - Give it ! - Okay , okay ... - There you go . - What the ... - Whats going on here ? Rajala just gave me a shitload of money ! - Right . What were you doing ? - Nothing . Your dick is hanging out ! Damn it ! Show me your hands ! - So you 're Lammi ? - Who the fuck are you ? I 'm Rajala . Jansson sent me since he didn 't reach you by phone . It might be wiretapped . Show me some ID . Yeah , Jansson mentioned you , you should be ok . - So this is it then ? - That 's the Key . Pretty cool , huh ? I wonder what 's it made of . - We need to get rid of it . - You can 't be serious ? - I am . Pack your stuff , we 're leaving . - To where ? A friend of mine has a cabin in the islands , we 'll dump the key into the ocean there . I still don 't know what the big deal with the Key is . Obviously you haven 't heard the full story of the Pyramid ? - Who the hell is that ? - Don 't know . Oh for fuck 's sake , Mykk盲nen ! Oh fuck ! The key ! Cocksucker ! - You bought this from Mykk盲nen too ? - How did you know ? Lucky guess . Going to be an expensive renovation ... Damn , he took the case . - What do we do now ? - Well you can start renovating ! What are you up to ? Get me some nuts , cloth , iodine tablets , - your dad 's old map of the Zone and a dosimeter . - What are you going to do ? - Save the day ! - Should we at least call Jansson ? - No way ! I took this job , I 'll finish it . I 'm going after him ! - In to the zone ? - Right . Alone ? There are soldiers there , you don 't even have a gun ! - I know . - I 'm going with you . - No way in hell . - Yes I am . You don 't have a map , I do . You need me . Get the map . And for the last time , you 're not coming . - Come on , I can take care of myself . - Doubt it . You 'll get yourself killed there . - Bullshit . - Peku , listen up . You don 't know the zone . Your father being a stalker doesn 't make you one . There is a shitload of artefacts ! How come Korpela hasn 't retrieved them himself then ? Korpela is an old man , he isn 't up to it anymore . It 's nearly 5 kliks to the house from the north-eastern border . Gr枚nholm and I might make it but not with you . Just give us the map and we 'll get your loot . No way guys , I 'm going with you . - You don 't trust us ? - I don 't trust YOU . What a fucking little ... Both of you ! Shut the fuck up ! Your thoughts on this , Gr枚nholm ? Shitty deal . Have fun . - Shit ! - We 'll go , just the two of us . Don 't know ... Come on ! Damn . Things you agree on ... - So , you start with the drinking then ? - Shut up . So , we 're going ? Two things : Firstly , you do exactly what I say and nothing else , understood ? - And the second ? - Keep your mouth shut . Jahwol , mein f眉hrer ! Let 's just go . First , I need a fillup . Enter . - Galitski came back . - And ? Lammi survived , there was someone else there too . And the key ? I 'll be damned , Pesonen was telling the truth . - Ok , let 's prepare to move out . - Already ? If Lammi survived , we need to act fast . What about Colonel Suhonen ? If he finds out ... The old fart won 't find out any of this . He 's all week in Helsinki negotiating this UN crap and meanwhile I 'm in command . - Don 't know , kinda risky . - Lindman . Within six months the UN will take charge of the operations - and then they 'll start investigating our actions here . When that happens , we 'd better have enough cash to be as far from here as possible . How much are they willing to pay ? Galitski called Moscow . They 're ready to pay anything we ask . And believe me , we 'll ask a lot ! Better hope we pull this off , otherwise we 'll end up in serious trouble . We won 't . We 'll pull this off . Period . Let 's prepare to move out . Us , eight men , Pesonen and Galitski . And Pesonen won 't be returning from this trip , understood ? - What about the radiation ? - Take an iodine pill . An iodine pill , what the hell ? Isn 't the radiation supposed to be lethal ? The rad levels here are mostly at the same level as in Chernobyl . - Mostly ? - Well , there are a few lethal concentrations . - Did you bring the dosimeter ? - Yeah , yeah . Good . Let 's go . Iodine pill , my ass ... Changing of the guard . Double the soldiers . We 'll wait a while . - Did you draw this route correctly ? - Yeah . We 'll cross over here ? - Here . - We 're on the western side . Pesonen 's and Gr枚nholm 's route went from the north by the train tracks . We 'll enter from the west and cut their path in Linnakallio . - With what ? Swearing at them ? - We 'll figure something out . Carve sharp sticks ? Sounds like a solid plan . We don 't have time for a proper plan if we want to make it to the Zone before sunrise . You still haven 't told me about the Pyramid ? I know . The guy was called Heinz Gartner . Who ? He who discovered pyramid . It was about fifteen years ago . He claimed he made it to the center of the zone and found a pyramid shaped object about six feet tall . Unfortunately , he died before he told anyone the exact location of it . - Like my father ? - Yeah . Give me the map and pick up your stuff . Let 's go . Time to go . - What 's the pyramid supposed to do then ? - Grant wishes . - You 're serious ? - Yeah . You 're saying , that a heap of junk is supposed to grant wishes ? - Yup . - Bullshit . That 's how the story goes , I 'm only telling it . - Doesn 't sound like a realistic story . - In the Zone , nothing is . Allright , the Sun is rising , let 's get on with it . - Look at this bush ! - Now that 's a hedge ! Alarm triggered in the western sector . Bearing 275 at the outer perimeter . - Cameras don 't show anything . - Check the infrared . Something obscure . Can 't make out what it is with these cameras ... I 'll call in a patrol . Bearing 275 , outer perimeter , confirm . Three six acknowledged . Over . - Hey you ! Come over here ! - Halt ! Don 't move ! - Sorry but I 've got something to tell you . - Don 't you know that this is a military area ? - Umm , watch out , behind you ! - Like I 'd fucking fall for tha ... Now we have a gun . Get moving ! - Oh fuck ! You killed him ! - No , I didn 't . Sure you did , you blew his head off ! Did not . Search this bastard and grab anything useful . B 36 , R 1 , do you read ? B 36 acknowledged . Situation normal , everything is ok . - What 's going on there . - A small weapon malfunction - but we 're all fine now . How are you ? - We 'll send a patrol . - No don 't , - we have a major gasleak here , very big , very dangerous ! Who is this ? Password ? Boring conversation anyway . Lammi ! We 've got company ! I took a look at the soldier . He was dead . Move your ass ! Alert to all patrols , targets on the move , bearing 048 , - I repeat , 048 . Did you have to kill him ? Now the soldiers will kill us ! Now you listen to me , you little punk ! That wasn 't the first time - I 'd had to kill someone and on this trip probably not the last ! There are two options here , kill or be killed , understand ? - I do , I do ! - Good ! Now RUN ! - What ? - RUN ! They killed Jussila . Shot him in the face . Shit ! Call the 4th battery , - tell them to aim all cannons at the western sector , right now ! Okay . I 'll call in the chopper . - Now what ? - We 're really off course here . Shit , we 're lost . Surrounded by soldiers . We 're fucked ! Shut it ! We 're not lost , just a bit off course . - What the hell do we do now ? - Going back is out of the question . We 'll need to cross the border somewhere near here . Quick , into the woods ! Stay with me , damn it ! They 'll kill us ! Lammi , calm down ! Keep your cool and we 'll make it . The border fence should be close by , keep it together ! What ? Yeah . - Oh fuck ! They have dogs ! - Move ! Here starts the real Zone , the anomalous area . - Kinda high radiation readings . - Way below lethal dosage . We 're really off course here . Our originally planned path is more to the south - but there is a swamp between us and it . Wouldn 't recommend crossing . We 'd need to backtrack , almost back to the border . Back ? No way , there 's like half of the Finnish Army there by now ! Well , guess we 'll have to try to cross this field then . Lets just move , anywhere , this dosimeter is clicking like crazy ! This area isn 't explored . You 'll handle the map , we 'll use the nuts for navigating . Give me a heading . That way . You 'll stay behind me , follow my footsteps , - no deviating from them , understood ? - Ok . - You sure ? Yeah , yeah . - I wonder what happened to all these people ? - Don 't trouble yourself with that . MINEFIELD Stop , damn it ! Didn 't I tell you to stay behind me ? Get back here , carefully ! MINEFIELD That was a scare , nearly crapped myself ! Be more careful from now on . We need a new route , give me the map . We 'll go around the minefield from the north . Give me a new heading . - There . - All right then . Decided to bring a souvenir along ? - Was it necessary to throw it there ? - Sorry . Shit , that smoke will be visible all the way to the border . So what ? It 's not like the soldiers would come after us . - Ever heard of artillery ? - Huh ? - Oh for fucks sake ! - What was that ? We need to have a serious chat . AR 2 acknowledged , over . The S盲盲ksel盲 battery opened fire towards the old Smedsbacka minefield , - two guys got through from the western border , killed one of our men . Lammi . I was expecting something like this . - Where is the Russian ? - Down by the river . - Galitski ! - Yeah ? You should have killed those two earlier . - What do you mean ? - Lammi and the other one - just entered the Zone from the west , near Smedsbacka . - You 'll go there and finish them off . - Ok Kaikkonen , Suvela ! You 'll go with Galitski . He 's in charge . Move ! We 'll be waiting for you in Linnakallio . Deal with them . Njet Problem . What the fuck are you grinning about ? It 's also in your interest that we 'll secure the objective . Otherwise you 're dead . We both know that whatever happens , I 'm dead anyway . Break 's over ! Move out ! - What does the map say ? - Huh ? We 're back on track . - About 6 kliks to Linnakallio . - Good . - What in the hell was that ? - Thermal concentration . We 'll go around it . Strong coffee , needs some diluting . - Do stalkers make a lot of money ? - Average . You can get rich if you 're good enough . Like your father was . - Did you know him ? - Kinda . - He was my mentor . - What was he like ? Red ? Quiet , calm - and like all good stalkers , observant . You have to be on your toes here , all the time . The soldiers learned that the hard way , like those there . They didn 't notice the gravcon in time . The chopper and it 's crew are crushed paperthin . - Grav what ? - Gravitational concentration . Still needs more of the good stuff . Could I be a stalker some day ? Do I have the talent ? - You still have a lot to learn . - Like what exactly ? Observation . You still haven 't noticed that we 're being watched . - What , where ? - Take it easy . Act normal . Who 's watching us , the soldiers ? Don 't know , three guys , about 50 yards behind me . - What do we do ? - Finish your coffee , before it gets cold . - I 'm going for a crap ! - What the hell ? Someone is watching us and you decide to go and have a crap ? Stalkers need to poop , too . Let 's move out . I just got here ... April fool ! OW ! Damn it ! Now you 're gonna get it ! Coffee 's not good for you . Stupid boy , you should 've stayed hom ... - Drop the gun , now ! - Fuck you , ruskie ! Who shot the thermos ? - I think it was him . - Fuck , that was my thermos ! - Drop the gun ! - Do as he says ! He 's serious ! - So am I. - What are you doing ? Gonna shoot this Russian bastard . That was a good thermos ! And expensive ! - Don 't shoot ! You 'll hit me ! - Just hold still ! - Close your eyes , if you want . - Don 't you understand me ? - Nobody understands that babble ! - Rajala , don 't you ... You fucking lunatic ! You could 've hit me ! - So could he . And he was way closer to you ! - What the hell ! - Where are the others ? - Li-linnakallio ... They 're in Linnakallio . Cold coffee ... How many are there ? A few , seven or eight men . Let 's move out . How are we going to handle those soldiers ? We have a home advantage and the element of surprise . They are waiting for these guys , not us . Pay attention , Lammi . Looks quiet . Maybe they 've not made it here yet . - Let 's just cross over quick ? - You 'll wait here . What the hell ? There are extra magazines in the satchel . If anyone else than me tries to cross the bridge , take him out . What if there is many of them ? I can 't handle all of them by myself . I 'm no Rambo . Lammi , take it easy . I 'll sneak in quickly and quietly , no-one will even know we 're here . - You don 't have to fire a single round . - I don 't know about this ... - Just do as I say ! - Okay , okay . Oh , and don 't go too close to the river . There are leeches in there . - Can 't those be burned off with a lighter ? - Not these . They are as big as dogs . I think there are anomalies marked on the map but I can 't make out the text . Must be in Cyrillic . You fucking idiot , you 're holding it upside down ! Oh , right ... Nevala , damn it ! Didn 't Kortelainen say that you 're not supposed to wander off alone ? - I needed to take a piss . - Right . - You 're assigned to guard the bridge with Koskinen . - Shit , can 't someone else go ? - I 'm getting tired of thrashing around . - Ahola and Kuusiluoma are guarding Pesonen - Laitinen and Jokela are patrolling the town . Which reminds me , - here is a map . Galitski marked out all the anomalies around here . - All right . - Hurry up , Koskinen left already . Yeah , yeah ... - Nevala . - Huh ? - What the fuck ... - Sleep , damn it ! Oh damn it ! - It 's coming from the bridge . - Son of a bitch ! Kuusiluoma , with me . You stay with Ahola and guard Pesonen and the case ! I wonder what the hell is going on down there ? Fucking Rajala ! Wait here , chill down , - you don 't have to fire a round . Bullshit ! - What do we do ? - Give me the gun . Now there 's more of them . Whats next , a whole company ? Can 't get him from this distance . Call S盲盲ksel盲 , let the artillery take care of that asshole . Ok . What the fuck are you up to ? - Couldn 't find anything smaller ? - Rajala , damn it ! Didn 't expect to see you here ! Did Jansson send you , or Lammi ? - Bit of both , actually . - Good that you 're here , - I needed to talk to you about ... Let 's get the fuck out of here ! This day can 't possibly get any worse ! Or then again ... Lammi seems to be in deep shit . Left one hundred , fire two times . Correct , fire ! Good . You direct the artillery , I 'll go get more men . Damn it , who 's on fire control ? Kuusiluoma had the radio , she has to be somewhere close . I 'll handle her , you clear a path to the bridge . Correction , right fifty , add fifty , two ... Add 250 , blanket fire , fire . - What ? - You heard me , blanket fire , order it . - That 's everything . - It 's not like you 'll have to pay for it ? - Well , no . - Then give the damn fire order ! Correction to the previous order ... - Fire ? - You 're fucking insane ! I can shoot you right there and give the order myself ! - Fire . - Thanks . That wasn 't so hard , was it ? - What the hell ? - Captain , sir ! - Nevala ! What the hell is going on ? - My jaw is dislocat ... What the fuck is going on ? Move your ass , damn it ! - Get moving ! - Preferably this year ! He threatened to kill me , I ... - The radio 's busted ? - Where the hell have you been ? Got hit . Where 's the medic ? Fuck . I need medical attention , let 's head back . We 're not going anywhere ! Put a bandage on it ! A bandage ? Damn it ! Pesonen , the key and all the men are gone ! What 's the point anymore ? Damn it , Lindman . We 'll continue because I say so ! Pick up your stuff ! Thanks guys ! That went well ! Well ? You started the fucking world war three back there ! Technically , you 're the one who started shooting . Anyway , everything turned out ok . We have the Key , Pesonen and we 're all still alive ! Let 's celebrate a bit ! No thanks , have my own . They didn 't confiscate this , - probably figured I 'd be better at my job when I 'm drunk . Well , aren 't you ? Again with the drinking ? Couple of alcoholics ! You should have some too , might make you less of an asshole . Fuck you , Pesonen ! Storm 's coming , we need to find some shelter . There 's an old bunker in Repola , we 'll spend the night there . - We 'll head back in the morning . - Back ? Surely we 're not leaving now ? We 've come this far , we have the Key and ... We 're leaving at dawn , Lammi and me . And we 're taking the Key . I 'm just doing as I 've been told . By who ? Jansson ? He just wants the Pyramid for himself . No , he doesn 't . This conversation is over . Anything you want to whine about , talk to Jansson . Good old Rajala , always doing everything by the book . Always . I have a bad feeling about this . Where is that bunker of yours ? Close by . Pesonen is afraid of little thunder ? You 'd be afraid too , if you 'd been in a Zone storm before . The wind has changed , the clouds are coming from the center of the Zone . - Brilliant ! We 're totally fucked ! - We still have time . Well , who 's responsible for us being in this shit ? What are you implying ? We wouldn 't be here , if you hadn 't talked to the soldiers ! - What the fuck are you on about ? - How much did they pay you ? You fucker ! If you had seen your friend 's head get blown off ... Hey assholes ! Cut that shit or you 're sleeping outside tonight . - Retard . - Wanker . Camel fucker . - Don 't see no jelly . - What 's that ? - Kind of colloidial gas . - Huh ? - Should we throw a nut in , just to be sure ? - Just what I was thinking . Stand back . Nothing . Ok , come on in . Devil 's Lanterns ! There 's a fortune in here ! Don 't fucking touch them ! They 're radioactive ! Should we check the place out , just to be safe ? - Pesonen is afraid of the bogeyman ! - Go fuck yourself , midget ! Pesonen , you check that way , we 'll go this way . Lammi , you should stop your bickering with Pesonen . I 'm tired of listening to you two all night , which we 'll probably have to spend down here . - But that asshole started ... - Are we clear on this ? - Clear . Damn it ... - This way . - What are we looking for ? - Anything unusual . Like what ? Witches jelly . - Is that dangerous ? - It 'll liquify everything but stone . Let 's move back a bit . - What the hell is that ? - Looks like a soldier . Probably been dead for a few decades . - Wonder what killed him ? - Wish I knew . - Fucking asshole ! - They 're coming to get you , Barbara ! - Hey , what do we have here ! - A dead soldier . There were more of them in the other chamber . Seems like they shot each other . Oh hello ! - What the fuck are you doing ? - Gold , damn it ! - Leave it the fuck alone ! - I could get good money for this ! Like I care . Lets set up a camp , I 'm getting thirsty . Uh , ok ... Looks like it 'll get pretty rough out there . Might have to be here for a while . - Now what do we do ? - Guess we 'll just make ourselves comfortable . Nature calls . I 'll take a piss while there is still time . How long did you say you have known Pesonen ? Couple of years . I met him at my father 's funeral . - He was at the funeral ? - Yeah , they go way back . He told me that my father taught him to be a stalker . When did you tell him about the Key ? I didn 't , he knew already about it . He said father told him about it before dying . Now you listen carefully ... We 'll talk later . Keep an eye on the case . Hell of a weather out there ! Hard to say if it 's only a storm - or is there about to be a blowout . Looks grim . Grim indeed ... - I can 't go on ... - Get moving ! The wound is bleeding ! - Did you hear me ? I can 't go on ! - Shut the fuck up and keep moving ! You know , we 're going to die here . Lindman , shut your fucking mouth and get moving ! You just don 't ... just don 't know when to quit . Game over , man . You son of a bitch . Quit waving that shit around . You might hit someone by accident . - Lindman ! - Come on then , lets move ! - What the hell ! - Come on , lets move ! - Lindman , stop ! - Here we fucking go ! - There 's an anomaly in there ! - I don 't give a fuck ! Lindman ! - This compass is of no fucking use . - We don 't need it to find our way back . So you 're still heading back tomorrow ? Yup . - No thanks . - Take some ! The Russians believe it helps against radiation . And they have experience with both . - Both ? - Vodka and radiation . Don 't want to keep the dosimeter on , keeps beeping like hell . I think it might be broken . It is a cheap piece of shit . Well there you go ! Vodka is the only efficient way to fight radiation . - So thats why you drink all the time ? - Well , no . And Rajala is having whisky , that doesn 't help at all . - Neither does vodka . It 's one of those urban legends again ... - Why do you drink then ? - Mostly to calm our nerves . And they 'll need calming after today ! All the stalkers drink , job habit . I guess more stalkers die of booze than in the Zone . - Since you two are so smart , answer this . - Yeah ? How is it possible for the Pyramid to grant wishes ? It 's probably just a legend . Like the Golden Sphere of Marmont - or the Wish Granting room in Chelyabinsk . - They 're probably all just urban legends . - There is a theory about that . - Well ? - The Pyramid controls the Zone . All matter , energy and time in the Zone . - Time ? - Yeah . But the catch is this , it 's only able to do it within the Zone . So you couldn 't wish for the death of the president of the USA then ? You could - but it might turn out that the Pyramid creates a lethal virus , - which the stalkers carry out from the Zone . The virus wipes out Mankind , including the president . Wish granted . - Damn . - One would need to be careful what to wish for . - Yeah . I 'd have a wish . - Well ? - What if I 'd wish - that the Zone wouldn 't have existed at all ? Why would you wish for something like that ? At least I wouldn 't have to sit here and listen to that crap . Good night ! Could the Pyramid do that ? Don 't know . Maybe . Wait here , I 'll go check that the route is clear . - Don 't leave me here ! - I won 't . - Am I going to die ? - No , you are not . Just wait here . - Don 't leave me . - I won 't . - Hey , wake up ! - What the hell now ... - Pesonen is gone ! - Maybe he 's just taking a shit ... - The case is gone too ! - I fucking knew it ! - Pack your stuff , we 're going ! - Where ? To the Pyramid ! Pesonen also took all the magazines . We only have 15 rounds left . We need to hurry , he has a good head start . I wouldn 't have believed ! That asshole , damn it ! Pesonen ? He is a sneaky fucker . And he 's been obsessed about the Pyramid for years . Which is what I needed to talk to you about earlier . Looks like he 's lied to you all along . - What do you mean ? - He 's never been Red 's apprentice , - he didn 't even know your father that well . He was at the funeral for another reason . - What ? - He was there because of you . Let me guess , this whole Pyramid project was all his idea ? - Yeah , but ... - He persuaded you to move here also ? Well , yeah but ... Dad wouldn 't have just given him the Key ? Not voluntarily , no . You mean ... He didn 't lie about that . Your father did tell him about it but only with a gun at his head . - He killed my father ? I 'll kill that fucking motherfucker ! - Wait a minute . - Let go ! - Damn it ! Take it easy now . - Let go , or I 'll shoot you too ! I 'm fine with you killing him - but you need to understand that you won 't make it here alone . You 'll need me for that . Now put that gun away before I 'll shove it up your ass ! Right . Can we move on now ? Give me the gun . Wait here . - What 's that ? - Didn 't I tell you to wait back there ? Sorry . - A rifle round ? - Pesonen . - What does it mean ? - It 's a message : Turn back now . No way . I 'll kill him . Even if it costs me my life . Your death can be arranged . Pesonen only has to wait for us to get to that clearing - and he could easily ambush and snipe us both . I 'm willing to take that risk . - Be my guest then . - Huh ? Go on then , I 'll cover you . A bit faster , thank you ... - The Pyramid should be in this building . - Probably so is Pesonen . You sure he would 've made it this far already ? Did you see him coming the other way on our way here ? - Well , no ... - Thought so . Wait here . No fucking way ! - What is it ? - Didn 't I tell you to wait back there ? - What 's over there ? - The Pyramid . - Really ? Let me see ! - Be careful , damn it ! - Whoa ! There it really is ! - So is Pesonen . - You 're sure he didn 't get lost on the way here ? - Pesonen knows his way . I know him too well . And he knows me . He 'll be expecting us . - What do we do ? - Wait here . - Yeah , but ... - You do as I say or I 'll punch you in the mouth ! - Alright , okay ... - And stay quiet ! Don 't even think about it . You 'll never make it to the case ! You should 've turned back at the dam . - What the fuck are you sitting there for ? - He told me to . If I move , he 'll kill me . - What the fuck are you talking about ? - I didn 't dare to cross the dam without a map , - so I backtracked to the village and decided to take my old route from there . He had made it all the way to the old tunnel and caught me there . - Who ? - Kortelainen . - You think I 'll believe your bullshit ? - You should . - Oh for fuck 's sake ... - Put down your gun , slowly . And let me see your hands . Sorry if I 'm in a bad mood - but I had to spend the night out in a lousy weather . And before that , some fucking clown decided to entertain us by bombing the shit out of my team ! - Oh that little stunt ... Quiet ! And call that " girlfriend " of yours over . Lammi ! Come out , they know you 're here ! - Oh for fuck 's sake ! - That 's exactly what I said ! - Pesonen ! You 're a dead man ! - I think we 're all dead in a minute . Let 's not get ahead of ourselves . - We have a small problem . - Oh , just one ? I don 't like to be interrupted . What are you looking at ? - We 've met before ! - Don 't ring any bells . Three years ago . - Am I going to die ? - No , you are not . Just wait here . - Don 't leave me . - I won 't . Drop the gun ! Get down ! Here 's another ! Doesn 't look so good . - He needs to get to a doctor , he 's dying ! - Shut up ! Did someone ask your opinion ? Check him . - Got any loot ? - No . Don 't lie to me ! He 's got nothing on him ! He looks really bad , should we call an ambulance ? Nah . Take him out . - I won 't shoot an unarmed man ! - For fucks sake . Get over here ! Move it ! Guard this one . Don 't do it , damn you ! And I swore on that day that I 'd find you and kill you . Thats adorable ! Now that we 're done with reminiscensing , - can we get back to business ? To the issue at hand ? So , are there any last words you 'd like to say ? - Lammi . - What ? RUN ! - Are you okay ? - What the fuck does it look like ? - Go on , I 've got this . - You 'll manage ? Just fucking go already ! Hey , don 't shoot ! Really , don 't ! Let 's make a deal ! Really ... Out of ammo ? I 've got some for you ! Lammi , where are you going ? Just when it 's getting fun ! - Yes ! - You remind me of your father . He too tried to crawl away crying before I killed him ! How 's it going to be , are you going to cry too ? Peek-a-boo ! Now you die , you fuck ! Shit ! Again with the ammo ? What do we need bullets for when we have this pipe ? Lammi ! I have a little something for you here ! - Say bye bye ! - Bye bye ! Hey , are you all right ? Yeah , I 'll manage . - What about Pesonen ? - He 's in a pretty bad shape back there . Good . Lammi . - I 'm not going to make it . - Don 't say that . It 'll turn out ok . And you won 't make it out of here without me . - The Pyramid is your only option . - Are you sure about this ? Take the Key and go make a wish . - But what if it ... - Can 't you for once do as I say ? You know what to wish for ! You know what to wish for ! What if I 'd wish that the Zone wouldn 't have existed at all ... The Good must be made from the Bad - for that is all we have . Subtitle timings by Warheart , laggy and lotsa @ divxfinland.org

Apparently he 's missing . There 's nothing new there . Hm ? How many people are in this building ? What , now ? Um ... not many . School 's over .

What the next 48 hours are about is abandoning everything you knew or thought you could rely on , and adjusting to the new reality . So , are the things in Utopia real ? BSE was theirs . - ALICE : What 's that ? - Comic . Are you going to show me or are you going to be a twat all day ? Keep it under your bed . That 's 11 now dead on the Shetland Island of Fetlar . We need a sample of the vaccine . There 's a man in Sheffield , a scientist called Donaldson . Get it to him . It 's me . The manuscript exists . The boy knows where it is . There 's a woman , works in secret , trusts no-one . - What 's her name ? - Her name 's ... Milner . BECKY : Right , shall we wait for Jessica ? WILSON : What for ? I can break in . GRANT : Yeah , I can break in as well . BECKY : Jesus Christ ! Am I the only one who can 't break into houses ? WILSON : We 'll teach you if you want . Ooh , got some bruising here . You 'll have to keep your weight off it . Thanks , Becky , for finding me . You got a boyfriend ? ( LAUGHS ) No , I haven 't got a boyfriend . You 're well fit . I knew you would be . I can tell from what you typed . From what you typed , I thought you were 24 and drove a Porsche . I will drive a Porsche when I 'm 24 . I 've got a girlfriend , though . Her name 's Alice . I met her yesterday . Have you got the manuscript ? Grant , listen to me . It 's very important . I need ... we need to ... - Ow ! - I 'm sorry . - I left it somewhere . - Right . When you 're ready , you need to come and tell me , OK ? What 's it like ? It 's ... not what I thought . I mean , I thought Part Two , it 'd be like a new story . But it ain 't . It 's the same , just ... just different . Like , the scientist is called Carvel . And the ... and the rabbit ? Has he got a name , Grant ? - ( WIND HOWLS OUTSIDE ) - I think it began with an L. So , he has had it , then ? I mean , he can tell us where it is ? He 's an 11-year-old boy who 's seen someone murdered . Right ? He ... he 's been alone for days . He 's not ready to trust anyone . So , do we give it to Jessica , then ? No way . God knows what she 's up to . We take it to this woman , to Milner . I mean , she 's MI5 . We take it to her , we hand it over . - We just get the fuck out of this . - Oh , fuck ! TV : ... with no mutations to the virus reported for almost 40 years . The Prime Minister is expected to face a call for action at Prime Minister 's Questions today . - Does he have it ? - BECKY : No . The manuscript ? Look , he 's left it somewhere . He hasn 't said where . - Did you search him ? - BECKY : We are not searching him ! You want to search this , darlin ' ? Oi , Grant , stop that ! She 's going to have to go through me . - And she thinks that 'll be difficult . - Sit down , Becky . What the fuck 's the matter with you ? And why are you so enthralled with ... ? - Is that Grant ? - What ? This is the image of the boy police believe is responsible ... GRANT : Why have they got my picture ? ... the deaths of eight children and two teachers at Bainstow Secondary School , in what police have described as scenes of unparalleled horror . The Prime Minister is expected to make a statement within the next 20 minutes . - But we can confirm ... - GRANT : That 's not me . ... that the fingerprints on the gun are those of Grant Leetham , a pupil at the school and the boy identified ... - That is not me ! - ... In these CCTV images . The Leetham family ... This is the image of the boy police believe is responsible for the deaths of eight children and two teachers ... How is he ? He 's pretending he 's OK . He 's ... terrified of what his mum thinks . BECKY : Christ ! How could they do that ? They faked the CCTV and the fingerprints . It don 't need to stand up in court . They just want to get hold of him . BECKY : No , I mean , how can they actually do it ? How can someone ... ? It 's a handful of kids . So what ? They 've just made Grant the most famous child in this country . The moment he 's picked up , they have him , and all it cost them was a handful of lives . Don 't you get it yet ? That is nothing to them . Death is part of it . Get used to it . Look , Becky , I ... Wait , no . - No , it 's not a good idea . - Why ? Won 't your girlfriend allow it ? Is it against orders ? ( MOANING AND GRUNTING ) ( THUMPS ) ( GRUNTS AND MOANS ) ( MOANING ) My dad wrote Utopia . I never knew him . Not really . I grew up on the run . I learned not to trust people , because you know what ? People always let you down . And they want to sugar-coat it , treat you like a kid . That 's fine for them . They 've been kids . Some of us don 't get to have childhoods . Becky and Ian are great . But they 're not like us . I want you to show me the manuscript . I won 't force you . It 's your choice . But I want you to come with me . I 'll keep you safe . You know I can . There 's no place for me here . Not now , or ever . We always said this was Bhopal and this was Lake Nyos . 10,000 lives . Don 't feel good being right . Where 's Grant ? ( ♪ ELBOW : One Day Like This ) ♪ So throw those curtains wide ♪ One day like this ... ♪ You like some shit music . Is this shit ? ( MUSIC OFF ) So , your dad was Mark Dane ? - His real name was Philip Carvel . - What , and you didn 't know him ? They got me out when I was about four . I was given to a man called Christos . He looked after me . But he was more like a guard than a dad . He did his best . He taught me how to steal . How to fight . How to survive , really . I was a total bitch to him , but he never got angry . He was amazing . What happened to him ? We were hiding in an old factory and suddenly they turned up . He hid me and ran out at them . They caught him , tortured him , killed him . What , and you saw that ? How old were you ? Ten . Are you hung FY ? - What are you doing now ? - Trying to bypass their firewall . It 's MI5 , not Asda . We 're better off hacking into the HMG network and sending her an intranet mail . Wilson , I work with computers , I know what I 'm doing . You 're an IT consultant , Ian . If I want to know how to make a printer work , - I 'll let you know . - ( FOOTSTEPS ) - BECKY : What are you two doing ? - Trying to get hold of Milner . We 're thinking of sending her some kind of internal mail . The only problem is , is that their firewall is triple-encrypted . Why don 't you just call her ? What ? Just call MI5 ? ( SNIGGERS ) With a phone ? Yeah . Why not ? What if they 're tracing her calls ? You have 42 seconds before they can put a trace on you . Wilson , how do you know that ? I saw it on Spooks . Right , don 't be on there for more than 30 seconds . I 'll time you . - ( RINGS TWICE ) - WOMAN : Security Service . Hello . Could I ... could I speak to Mrs Milner , please ? WOMAN : One moment . They 're putting me through . WOMAN 2 : Hello . Milner . Um ... we 'd like to talk to you . We 're , er ... we 're friends of Jessica Hyde . Why ? Jessica Hyde . Right . Sorry , does she work here ? You don 't know her ? I have no idea who you 're talking about . Can I ask , who is this ? Wrong number . She said she 'd never heard of her . - ( PHONE RINGS ) - Oh , fuck ! MILNER : That line was monitored . This isn 't . Wherever you are , get out of there right now . Er ... OK . There 's a chapel on Arbel Lane in Levingstone . It 's always empty . Meet me there .

You should eat better , then . Have you got the vaccine ? No , I ... I tried . Listen , they 've got Fetlar shut down . Nobody 's getting in or out . No ... no doctors , no specialists , nothing . - It 's all their own people . - You haven 't got it ? Well , isn 't there another way ? Well , not unless you happen to have one of the corpses in your pocket . Look ... look ... I ... I need ... I need something on them . You really have no idea who you 're dealing with , do you ? No . That 's why I need your help . - ( BIRDSONG ) - ( INSECT BUZZ ) IAN : Do you want to talk about last night ? - BECKY : Did you like it ? - Of course I liked it . Then what 's there to talk about ? You 're such a pain in the arse . As if life isn 't difficult enough . Tell you what . Why don 't we get married , Ian ? Jessica can be my maid of honour . All right . I 'll tell you what . I 'll say it . I like you . There , I said it . It 's out . So , now you can punch me or give me a Chinese burn or just ... just kick me in my balls . I reckon you 'd like that .

Why don 't you let me have that gun ? How do I know this isn 't a trap ? How do we ? IAN : Look , we 've told you everything we know . We ... we want to ... to come in . Come in ? Ian , there is no " in " . I 'm not MI5 here . I can 't protect you . What do we do ? We need to find out why they want the manuscript . I think I know . It has the identity of Mr Rabbit . Grant said , but he couldn 't remember the name . MILNER : That 's it . He 's kept his identity secret for nearly 30 years . That 's why they 're so desperate for the manuscript . He mentioned a girl called Alice , said that that was his girlfriend . OK . I can find out if she 's come forward . You need to go there . No , no way . Look , we 're not cops . We 're not spies . This has nothing to do with us . What did Jessica tell you about her father 's ideas , Ian ? On racial purification . What ? He was a fucking Nazi ? Philip Carvel wrote a paper called The Survival Of The Genome , in which he advocated a human cull . This is the same man who became involved with weaponising disease . NATHAN : Right . OK . If you can 't help us , we need to go . Look , I can 't do this on my own . This has one number on it , mine . Why come this way round ? You can hold it if you like . ( COMPUTER STARTS UP ) - What if they give this room out ? - They won 't . It 's occupied . Can you teach me how to do that ? There 's lots I can teach you . What , to be like you ? Would you like that ? You need to change the way you look . - ( TV NEWS PLAYS ) - Argh ! Ah , no , no , no ! Fucking hell ! Ahh ! Ahh ! That fucking hurt ! We are close , aren 't we , Grant ?

However , three apparently healthy men in their 20s are now known to ... Ah ! No , Jessica ! Ah , that 's my head ! ( LAUGHS ) Nice ! - You look cute . - You 're kidding ? Look , you 're making me a fucking Goth ! No ! You 're not putting that on me ! No way ! You 're not putting that on me . No , you ... No , you 're not putting that on me . Grant , just ... just come home . Just go to the police and we 'll ... we ' ll sort it out . Or ... or phone your mum up . We 'll come and get you . Everything ' ll be fine . OK , I 'm here. just , please , just ... just , please , just come home . OK ? It 'll be all right . I know ... I need to tell her I didn 't do it . You know we can 't , Grant . Not yet . Am I going to be normal after this ? Let 's drink some booze . ( LAUGHS ) ( HEAVY BREATHING ) There 's a girl in Richmond . Alice Ward . I 'll go . ( HEAVY BREATHING ) What was I like ... as a child ? My earliest memory is ... killing animals . Slaughterhouse . You were there . - Watching . - Arby , please . For as long as I can remember , I 've killed . But ... yesterday there was a boy holding these and I couldn 't . Arby , don 't . Not now . Not now . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Who are my parents ? You don 't have parents . You were part of a consignment from ... Bulgaria , I think . Carvel was ... brilliant but he wasn 't kind . Some of the things he did were , by necessity , cruel . What about Jessica Hyde ? Is she like me ? Did he do things to her ? He was not a man of compassion . Lee was killed the other day . Next to you , he 's the person I knew most . Why doesn 't that hurt me ? Because you 're not the same as others . You 're special . I don 't feel special . I look mental . Like a fucking Goth . ( LAUGHS ) How many of those have you had ? Can I ... can I have another one ? What 's the manuscript like , Grant ? Amazing . I didn 't read it all . Bits . What about ... What about my dad ? You are going to tell me where it is , Grant , aren 't you ? Cos I could make you . I could just make you tell me . ( GULPS ) Oh , I 'm going to be sick .

I 'm sorry . I want my mum . ( HE CRIES ) I want my mum . ( BIRDSONG ) Her name 's Alice Ward . Her mother brought her into Richmond police station yesterday . She 'll be back today . I 'm sending an officer to get her . You need to go to her house . That 's what Jessica will do . I need a reason . Why us ? What difference does it make if we know who Mr Rabbit is ? There 's a story about how he got his name . He was embedded with the criminal underworld in Guangdong . But he was playing everyone off against each other . The Russians , the CIA , the gangs . So , the Americans got fed up and they let a particularly nasty crime boss know that he was their man , and the boss found him , dragged him off the street , right through the middle of a busy office block . They tortured him and , as a lesson to others , the boss carved his own name into this man 's stomach . Rabbit . Have you ever seen the Chinese character for " rabbit " , Ian ? Lots of lines . Lots of cuts . Somehow he managed to get free and , despite being unarmed , he killed everyone in that room . Then he went back through the office block and killed everyone who 'd seen him . By the time he was finished , 265 people on three continents had lost their lives , and not a single living person knew his identity . That 's who Mr Rabbit is . He is the beating heart of all this , and , if we can find his identity , it ends and you go home . I need to get across to Fetlar . Sorry , sir . There 's a quarantine in place . I 'm with the Department of Health . I have a permit of access ... issued by the Minister . Plus , er ... an inter-department waiver , as well as a warrant for inspection . We weren 't told about all this . Look , I 've come all the way from London . I 'm not turning back . Here . You 'll have to call him . - What , phone the Minister ? - Yeah .

 Here we are on the way home . We 're going to the airplane . Whoo , home . Do you really have to tape everything ? Yes , I do . O.K. , um , well , maybe you should buy your own camera . Um , why would I do that if I could just use yours ? Right , like you do all the rest of my stuff . Exactly . Hello , welcome aboard . Hello , welcome aboard . Hello , thanks . - Hi . - Hi . Hello , ma 'am . Nice necklace . Thank you . I 'm coming , Jess . You 're holding up the line . You 're really embarrassing me right now . - Just keep walking ... - Hi . And pretend like you don 't know me . - Hi , guys . - Hi . Do you know where our seats are ? Hi , ma 'am . Um , second to last . Thanks . - Hello . - Hi . Right here . Hi ... um , yeah , just a second . I think we 're down here . Here we go . Do you want ... - yeah , go ahead , take the window . Ooh , I love your bag ! Oh , thank you . Sit down . Hang on , that guy has a cool green beanie . That girl is taking forever just to put her bags up . Must be heavy . Oh , that guy helped her . Trish , why don 't you buckle up ? What ? Not yet . Hi . Hi . Nice camera . Thank you . " Nice camera . " Bald guy . Uh-oh . He doesn 't ... - he looks a little drunk . Yeah , I don 't think he looks happy . Hi . That boy looks nice . Are you nervous flying ? I am , yes . Why ? Um , I don 't know , dying ? The fear ... it doesn 't really sound good to me . Yeah , but ... I heard once that it 's safer to fly than it is to drive in a car , rather than flying in a plane . Really ? Yeah , it 's true . I like to stay on the ground . Me too , I like driving . She 'll be fine . It 's better . As soon as we start taxiing , I am gonna need you to turn the camera off . You can turn it back on once we 're in flight . O.K. No , no , no , don 't tell her to turn it back on . It has to stay off . And uh , if I could also just have you move your bags , please . Oh , sorry . Thank you . We are currently third in line for takeoff and are expected to be in the air in approximately seven minutes ' time . We ask that you please fasten ... please ? Give me my camera back . Hi , sir . Can you please give me my camera back ? We also ask that your seats ... - hello . Do you like being on camera ? Can you please give me my camera back ? Or does this make you uncomfortable ? I would prefer not . He doesn 't want to be ... o.K. , you have to put this away now . Enjoy the flight . Jess . What 's that ? Oh , my gosh , give it back . Angry bald guy 's getting mad at the flight attendant . Absolutely , as soon as we start . It will calm me down . - Are you prescribed medication ? He needs a drink to calm him down . I 'm afraid I cannot offer you a drink until 10 minutes after flight . What I can do is I can offer you a seat further up with less people around if that makes you more comfortable . I don 't want another seat , I just want a drink . That should take care of everything . Alcoholic . Shh ! I think for $ 500 that I paid , plus $ 25 for the extra bag , it wouldn 't kill you to offer me a little service . Sir , I need you to keep your - voice down . - My voice is down . No , it is not , sir . No , it 's not . You don 't want to hear my voice raised . Shut up ! If you would like to raise your voice , you 're welcome to step off the plane . I think that this airline is rotten . Then do not fly with us again . If you could please put your seat up . I need you to put your seat up . Crap , put it away , put it away ! Turn it off , turn it off . Yes ! We 're finally moving , Jess . O.K. , please get that thing out of my face and put it away like I asked you to . Ugh , fun spoiler . I know , put it away please . Fine . Ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the crew , I ask that you please direct your attention to the flight attendant as we review the emergency procedures . There are six emergency exits on this aircraft ... take a minute to locate the exit ... are you paying attention to the exit rows ? Are you paying attention ? ... may be behind you . Are we in an exit row ? To fasten your seatbelt , place the metal clip ... Jess , I don 't think you could lift 50 pounds . - Shh ! - Make sure you know how to undo it so you don 't get stuck in the plane . ... the " fasten seatbelt " sign may be turned off . However , for your safety , we require ... once again , folks , we 're sorry for that long delay . Are you getting scared now ? We 're gonna take off soon . ... so we should be out of here in just a few minutes . A few minutes ? We 've already been here for an hour ... it 's getting dark . ... that you keep your seatbelt fastened at all times while seated . Cellular phones may be only used while the aircraft is at the gate and the boarding door is open . All cellular phones must be turned off and stowed when the boarding door is closed . Uh-oh , she 's seen me . I told you . Yes , takeoff . My favorite part . Finally . It 's just like a roller coaster . I love it , Jess hates it . Getting a little nervous there ? Yeah . Well , why are you , because you fly all the time . Yeah , but I ... I don 't like flying . Just do us all a favor and not throw up again , o.K. ? Oh , yeah . It 's o.K. , we 're almost in the air . Well , New York was a blast , but now it 's time to head home and start doing homework again . Yikes . Well , bye , New York , hello , L.A. - Trish . - Sorry . Trish , come on . I was just looking out the window . Can you see anything ? Uh , no it 's kind of cloudy . I mean , I see my book in my hand , but I can 't see anything else outside . - Bummer . - Sorry . That 's ' cause you need more light . What ? Yeah , you need more light . Cool , do you have , like , a flashlight ? No ... I have one of these . - Well ... - Check this out . All right . Wait for it , wait for it . And the lord said , " let there be light . " Wow . That 's so bright . That 's awesome . It 's fully adjustable . It 's great for situations like this . Cool . That 's fantastic . Yeah . So why do you have , like , all those bags and stuff full of cameras ? And why do you have a fancy light for your camera ? Well , it 's because I 'm a camera thief ... I steal cameras and I sell them on the black market . Really ? No , of course not . No - you believed that ? - No . - Yes , you did . I didn 't believe that . I think she believed it . Yes , you did . Yeah . No , I 'm a journalist , I 'm a photojournalist . Cool . So you 've been , like , all over the world ? I have , I have . I 've been to such beautiful , scenic places like , uh , well , uh , Afghanistan , Iraq , recently Libya . Wait , Afghanistan and Iraq ? They are not beautiful places . They are , actually , parts of them are . Now , the parts I saw were not particularly beautiful , at least when I was there , but uh , yeah , that 's where I 've been . That 's cool . So you 've seen like , houses blow up and gunshots and stuff ? Trish , he probably doesn 't want to talk about that . Nah , it 's fine . Yes , I have , I 've seen some ugly , ugly stuff , but I 'm going to do something different now . Like what ? Uh , something a bit more peaceful . Like ? Like , well , ironically , traffic . Traffic ? That 's boring . Compared to watching houses blow up . Perhaps , perhaps , but self-preservation is an - instinct that I possess so ... - Yeah . I agree with you on that one , I don 't think I could watch people getting ... - besides , have you been stuck in traffic in L.A. ? It 's not quite so peaceful . Oh , I know . We 're stuck in it every day . Exactly . For hours and hours . You could do it on , like , road rage . I could do it on road rage , why not , why not ? That 'd be cool . Yeah . Is that a shot against me or something , Trish ? - Yeah . - Really ? Yes . Mm-hmm . I 'm a good driver . I don 't ... I don 't get mad . Well , what 's your story , what 's your story ? Um , well , we are coming back home from our Christmas vacation so we 're going home to L.A. and um , she has to get back to yeah , sad . And I 'm a photographer , or I 'm like , I 'm trying to be one . Really ? Yeah . I just kind of started . Is she messing with me ? No , I 'm serious , she really is . No , for real , for real . Oh , that 's great . - Yeah . - O.K. So ... - hobby ? You want to make a career of it , what ? Career . Yeah , I just finished school , so now it 's time to ... - Get on it . - O.K. She takes pictures of everything . Well , that 's , you should take pictures of everything . Thank you . It 's important . - You gotta keep that camera going . - Yes , I do . Um , uh , do you wanna tag along , this thing , I have one assistant , but , uh , you 're welcome to tag along and observe . - Really ? - Sure . Can I come too ? Oh , my God , thank you so much . Um , you 're welcome and yes , you may come , but only if you don 't say a single word the whole time . Ha ... she can 't come . Not one single word ? Not a single word . That 's impossible .

Two , three . " If I can come ... " No , she can actually say " six words " , those two words . She can say " six words . " Oh , " six words . " Gotcha , that 's it . You 're gonna fail . Whatever . Can I give you my information ? Please do . You guys wanna play around with this little gadget ? Yes . Can I please use it ? No ... she has a track record for breaking things . Be careful . I promise I won 't break it . If you do , I will break your legs , um ... - Really ? - No . Good , ' cause I like my legs . I know ... o.K. , I 'll break your arms . Um , I 'm kidding ... Playing around with you . I 'll show you how to use it later . - O.K. - O.K. ? Sorry we 've been kind of ignoring you , ma 'am . It 's all right . So , do you fly often ? I do , yeah , I fly a lot .

It takes people out one by one , so we need to stay together in a group . He 's right . I don 't think we should stay here . Charlie ... - If you go out there , Charlie , you 're going to jeopardize your safety and the safety of everyone in here . You 're going to attract its attention and it 's either going to get you or us or both . The only thing we can do is stay here and stay together until morning . I need some air . Charlie , we all need some air . Charlie , sit up , sit up . We need to figure out how to defend ourselves , guys . Sit up and breathe . Sit up and breathe . Help me . Somebody help me , please .

Stay sitting , stay sitting . I think we should come up with a plan and get the fuck out of here . Right , well , the plan is to stay here until morning . That 's gotta be the plan . We can 't see anything out there . We gotta find a way to defend ourselves . We got one gun . Is there anything else we can defend ourselves with ? What time is it ? How long did ... is anybody getting reception ? Anybody getting reception on their phones ? Does anybody have phones ? Girls , do you have a phone ? Do you have a phone ? No , my phone fell out . Anybody got reception ? I got mine taken away . No reception . This just doesn 't make any sense . This does not make any sense . No , it doesn 't . Stuck in a goddamn meth lab in the middle of nowhere . I 'm never flying to L.A. again . We 're not in L.A. , man . We didn 't make it to L.A. I 'm taking amtrak . I 'm taking whatever . Guys , um ... what do you think we should do ? Laura ? What do you think we should do ? You said there was a road ? Oh , God . Yeah , yeah , yeah . - Right . - There was a road . There 's a road ? - So we 're not in the middle of nowhere . - We 're not . We 're not in the middle of nowhere . Once it 's light , we can go out there , we can try and find this road , we can look ... We are in the middle of nowhere , we 're , we 're in a Charlie ! Can everyone shut up for a second ? Seriously , I ... this isn 't national geographic . Seriously . Please ? All right . - Just for a little while . - O.K. How you feeling , Charlie ? All right , I ... I apologize if I 'm ... whining but , uh ... I had a heart attack last year and , uh ... I haven 't had my heart medication . It 's somewhere . It 's probably in Albuquerque right now ... And ... I 'm just a little tense . That 's ... why are you tense , Charlie ? I 'll tell you what , I am going to own that airline after my lawsuit . Yeah , I think this ranks as one of my top three or four worst days . Wow . What was the worst ? Uh , uh ... I don 't know . If we make it out of this , this might end up being the best day of my life . Not to turn into Charlie here , but , uh ... It has been an awfully long time . Yeah , it has . Someone should be here . They probably aren 't coming . And we 're not talking about like , we 're not talking about an hour or we 're not talking about ... it 's been at least a couple hours , I know that . Something 's wrong . Or five hours . On TV , man , they 're there , like , what , 20 , 30 minutes ? Yeah . Yeah , but that 's TV . No , I 'm talking about news . Like the news , man . Like it seems like those news people are there like ... That . That 's true . And it 's not like we , uh , we went down somewhere in remote South America or , you know , we 're ... well , maybe they 're still looking , maybe they 've found the plane and maybe they 're still looking for us . We 're between L.A. and , and Vegas . I used to drive that , you know ? Yeah . There 's plenty of places between there , you know ? I don 't know . There 's something over there , guys . What ? Where ? Right there . Oh , geez . What is that ? This , uh , this looks like , this looks military . That is military issue , no doubt . What 's in it ? What 's in it ? Oh , my God , guys ! Flashlights ! We 've got ... here . Walkie-talkies ... we 've got a walkie-talkie , guys . Here . Oh , my God . Does it work ? Hello , can anyone hear me ? Did you hear that ?

Well , I think it 's ... - furniture and everything . - I think it 's safe . - Yeah . I think it 's safe . Don 't you find it a little odd that there 's a bunch of random furniture in this rundown ... well , yeah , but if the walls are sturdy , we 've got windows to look out of , it 's the safest building we 're going to find , I think . I think we need to stay here . The least odd thing I 've seen in a long time . - Yeah . Oh , there 's another room over here . It 's through there . This phone , is there a Jack ? Trish checked it already . What is this ? A radio ! Ancient radio . Like from world war one ... Anybody ? Hello ? I don 't know how to work radios , I don 't know . Anyone ? This is , hello ?

I repeat , we 're under attack ! Hello , hello , is anybody out there ? Can anybody hear me ? My name is Laura Hawkins , I 'm a U.S. air marshal . Can anybody hear me ? Over . ... now , need backup now ! Mayday , mayday , can anybody hear me ? Over . Oh , come on ... is anybody out there ? Can anybody hear me ? Over . Please respond . Over . God damn it ... - Shh ... Damn it ! Hello , can anybody hear me ? Please respond . Over . We need help . Over . Did you guys hear what was being said ? - Like , what was , what was ... - Screaming . Sounded like all of us screaming , I don 't know . What was it ? I don 't know . What the hell was that ? This is n.T.S.D. , please respond , over . Oh , my God . Hello , my name is Laura Hawkins . I 'm a U.S. air marshal . Can you hear me ? Over . We 've been looking all over for you , where are you ? Over . We are uncertain of our exact location at this time . We had to leave the aircraft . We are , we are in some sort of , some sort of town . Uh , it seems like we 're in some sort of storage facility . The town seems to be deserted . Do you have any idea where we could be ? Over . We 've been trying to triangulate your exact location . How many survivors are there ? Over . There 's five survivors . Over . Was the plane intact when you crashed ? Over . No , it was not intact . Uh , the , we were in the back half of the aircraft . The wing , the tail end of the aircraft . We have five survivors , two young girls . We have several causalities . We need help . Over . What portion of the fuselage is left ? Over . The tail end of the fuselage is remaining . Over . Copy , tail end . Are you near the fuselage ? Over . No , we are not . We were forced to leave the fuselage . We uh , we are in a town , maybe , uh , a few Miles away . We are uncertain of our exact location . Over . Are you able to return to the crash site ? Are you able to return to the plane ? Over . No way . We are unable to return to the aircraft at this time . We have been pursued by some sort of animal . We have received several causalities . Over . We understand your situation , however , we need you to return to the plane . You must go back to the aircraft and retrieve the emergency box at the rear panel of the aircraft . Inside , there will be a flare gun kit . Your instructions are to fire the flare into the air so we can ascertain your exact location . Over . We are unable to return to the aircraft at this time . Over . Is there , is there any other way that you can locate us ? Over . It 's going to take a very long time if you do not follow the instructions I told you . - Fire ... - Can you hear me ? Over . Can you hear me ? Over . Oh , no . Come on ! Keep trying , keep trying ! Try it again ! Can you hear me ? I cannot hear you . Please respond . Over . One more time , just keep going . Please respond . Please respond . Over . Can you hear me ? Please respond . Over . Do you really want to go back to that plane ? Do you really want to go back to that plane ? You know what , look , I really don 't see that we have any other option right now . They need to be able to find us . They need to know our location , we need to be able to get back there and shoot off those flares , that 's the only way they 're going to find us . They said they didn 't know how long it 's going to take . Oh , my God . If they can 't find our location , it could be days . Lois got killed at the plane ! I know , honey . Look , the reality is , there 's , I mean , whatever 's pursuing us , there 's more than one . Yeah . They haven 't been around in a while , but we know they 're going to come back . We have a couple of flashlights here . I have my gun . If we stay together . Listen , what if we don 't take the same road back ? No way , no way , I 'm not taking that road again . We 're gonna take a different path back . So we stay together , we use our flashlights , we got the lights from the camera . Do you have any idea , 'cause I mean , we 're just , I mean , listen , we 're just running . I have no idea , like , how do we get back to the plane ? You said the north star , you said you saw the north star before ? Can you show me where that is ? If we follow that , we can get back to the fuselage . Really ? You know how to do that ? Listen , every time , every time that thing has been near us , it 's been in an open space . If we stick to , if we stay off that open road ... - yeah . No , you 're right . It , uh , it tries to , uh , it like , divides us , yeah . If we stay together ... close together . All right , guys , so the plan is we 're going to stay close together . Find a different route . We 're gonna find a different road . You 're going to show me the north star . - Yes . And we 're gonna move quickly and we 're gonna move quietly . We got to stay together , all of us . Let 's go . All right , let 's get out of here , come on . You guys ready ? We can do this guys , all right , we can do this . Just think about those flares . They haven 't been around for a while , so just be quiet . Just be quiet . Big dipper , right ? Where is it ? - Shh ... - The dipper 's right there ... so follow the handle to the north star . Right . So it 's this way , guys . Guys , come on over here . Stay together . Let 's go . We 're gonna go this way . Shh ! That way ? Yeah , yeah . This way ... let 's go . I think the darker the better . Yeah , I think so too . You all right ? You all right ? You need help ? You all right ? You all right back there ? Stay together . The pain 's not really in the leg anymore . What do you mean ? Where is it ? What 's going on ? I dunno . Jesus , Jesus . I 'd feel a lot more comfortable if you had your gun out .

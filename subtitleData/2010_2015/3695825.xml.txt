 Found this one hiding In the captain 's quarters . I was hardly hiding . I was doing my hair . She had the door locked . It is my room . I 'm afraid that 's no longer true . I wouldn 't be so hasty . Sam 's quarters are drafty . You might want a little extra warmth . Signorina Allegra Bracchioforte de Venezia At your service . Charmed . Is she the last one ? I smelled a few rats Crawling around in the bilge , But we 'll get them . Throw her overboard . Wait , wait ! One of your rats , Amelie , our engineer , She 's quite loyal to Sam . A little infatuated , actually . She knows every inch of this ship . I might be able to help you smoke her out . So , why are you telling me this ? Guess . I think you like power . I think whoever controls the boat Has power , And if it 's not going to be you , Then there are ... Other ways to exert control . I am transparent to you , Unable to hide my motivations , Which is a good basis for a partnership , no ? Besides , you need me . I was Sam 's confidante , Privy to all his plans to find the source . I don 't care about Clemens ' idiotic quest . I have an agenda of my own . Really ? Does it involve adventure ? If you call armageddon a lark . I 'm going to wage war on the gods , Shake the heavens , And bring this entire farce to a conclusion . Now , if you wish to participate , You 'd best prove as useful as you say , Because I 'm not good with disappointment . Nothing . No footprints on the other side ? I don 't know about Hal , But Matt would have fought like hell . Even if he couldn 't swim to shore , I mean ... He just would have floated downriver . No . He was shot two times . I couldn 't save him today . I couldn 't even do that . I just ... I just watched my friend go down in the water . There is but one path we can choose . We are never going to catch them . We are never going to catch them By following the river . We 're tortoises , And that hare ain 't getting any slower . You all right , Mr. Porter ? Not really . No sign of Hal , and ... Matt 's gone . I can 't believe those words are coming out of my mouth . Well , are you certain ? Yeah . What about Tomoe ? Is she certain ? She says the only way to find them Is to join ' em , And I don 't know . I 've already been around here twice . I just can 't do it again . Everyone must heed their calling in this life , Especially here . Her decision is no more or less valid than yours . We will see them all again , Rest assured . The only real enemy in this life is despair , my friend . I know that . I 've been there myself . I lost my wife , My daughters , And I woke up here alone . I found one infallible solution . Hey , maybe this is not the time ... I am pontificating . Anger . That 's the cure for what ails you . You get yourself good and riled up . That 's what I did , Transformed myself into a mean-spirited , stubborn , Irascible hornet . Raged at the world ! Anger is a distraction . Purpose . Purpose is a gift from allah . We 're spending too much time winding back and forth . The nottie has to stick to the river . We sure as hell don 't . Cross the mountains ? Revenge , Our most comforting friend , Is waiting for us on that boat . I 've been a poor husband . I wasted our lives on war And grasping for power . I ask for your forgiveness . They will remember you Long after I have been forgotten . Little girls will ride their ponies , Pretending to be Tomoe Gozen . I will find you . Welcome back , Mr. Ellman . Judging by your reaction , Your last few moments in the river Were not all that pleasant . Please keep that in mind as we proceed . What are you doing to me ? Where am I ? Jessie ? It 's okay , babe , I 'm coming . I 'm sorry , baby . That 's why I was afraid to pull you into my life . I never wanted anything to happen to you . I saw a ring . A ring ... Was it for me ? Yeah . Then I 'm happy . My answer is yes . No ... No . No , Jess ... Jessie ... No , Jessie , wake ... Jessie , wake up . Wake up , baby . Jess ... No ... Hmm , a good strong emotional memory . No ! No , that 's not the way it happened . Perhaps yes , Perhaps no . Who 's to say ? I was there . That is not the way it happened ! I 'm confused . You wish with all your being That that was the way it happened , yes ? So , what 's the difference ? What the hell are you doing to me ? What the hell are you doing to me ? That 's not the way it happened ! That 's not the way it ... That 's not ... That 's not the way it happened ... That was ... Vigorous . When I was a soldier in India , I came across a book called the Kama Sutra . It was ... Quite educational . It won 't work , by the by ... Seducing me so that I will relax my guard , And you can find the opportune moment to strike . From one serpent to another . Yes , we are despicable creatures , aren 't we ? And yet I died of old age In my own bed , With my wife at my side . Oh ? A moral lesson ? Quite the opposite , really . My death was more ... Poetic , Poisoned by a rival . Well , just so as you know , I never drink or eat anything That I haven 't prepared myself . Very healthy of you . Show me that twisty one again . No , not now . Work to do . Worlds to end . You really intend to destroy this place ? Watch and see . No ! Well , I think that 's quite enough Of that nonsense . So who exactly is it you 're looking for ? Am I that obvious ? This world is home To thousands of villages And hundreds of thousands of people , Perhaps all of humanity at one point or another , And everyone is looking for someone . Including yourself ? I may be the exception . I 'm looking for a way out . Though you may be an argument to the contrary . You son of a bitch ! Clearly , not an image you wish to cherish . It 's not real . This , All those images in my head , It 's just some sick game you 're playing ! None of it 's real ! Is it ? Is this real ? Define " real . " Interesting . You have no grailband , You stopped Pizarro , You almost took the ship from Burton , And yet you expect me to believe That was all random chance ? What did they ask of you ? The second chancers ? What did they ask you to do ? I have no idea what you 're talking about . I just want to find her ! Jessie ! The girl you showed me in my dreams . I just want to find the real Jessie . I just want to find the real Jessie . That 's it . Perhaps that was the real Jessie , The one so vividly displayed , Or would you prefer to cling onto a burnished image From the past ? You 're so good at reading the bumps on my head , You tell me . Sadly , I suspect You would not be able to accept the truth . I have no reason to accept your truth . If you wish the discomfort to end , You will . You don 't have the slightest clue who I ... Am . You have a surprising appetite for abuse . It would seem you 've come to the right place . Leave me alone . If I had to come back from the dead , Why not somewhere hot , man , like Jamaica ? This is not Eyrie . You may want to conserve energy . We 've got a long climb ahead of us . Look , man , I hate waiting , man . I always have . Not much on sleep , either , I 'd say . Hey , sleep is for the rich . I prefer the casino . Good place to hang out all night , And it kinda keeps me out of the upper tax bracket . A man after my own heart . I too enjoy a good wager . It 's another slaver camp . Same as every grailstone Between here and the river . Nine slavers , a dozen slaves . What is up with mankind and slavery ? Each grailband only works once a day , So if you want to eat well ... The strong will always prey on the weak . That is the sad nature of humanity . Hey , Sam , I 've been meaning to ask you , What was it like in the civil war ? Nothing civil about it . There is one more thing . I saw one of our friends down there ... Hal . He 's being held captive . So , if the professor made it , What about Matt ? Then it 's settled . We 're taking the stone . Three to one odds , The element of surprise on our side . Could be worse . Allons enfants de la patrie ... Le jour de gloire est arriv√© ... You enjoy fighting far too much . Yeah , it beats driving a taxi . All right , Mr. Porter . Here we go . Coming . Jessie ... Jessie ? She said to tell you She was in love with another man , And to give you this . Jessie ! We are not your enemies , Mr. Ellman . Our salvationist cause seeks to free you and your kind From this eternal riverworld prison , But you are too pathologically stubborn , And your animosity for Mr. Burton Runs too deep for you to be useful . Can I ... Can I go back to being dead now ? Oh , I would have you killed , But that would only facilitate your eventual resurrection By your champions , Who are deluded enough to believe That this farce of an existence Is a second chance . They are pathetic dreamers and will soon be defeated . Enjoy your stay with us , Mr. Ellman , Which will be eternal , Unless your nemesis , Mr. Burton , Can bring this world to an end . If I were you , I would pray for his success . Tomoe Gozen ... Go and find him . He needs your help . Hello ? Is someone there ? Can you hear me ? Yes ... Who are you ? Please answer me . Jessie ? Jessie , is that really you ? Oh , God , Mattie ! I can 't believe you 're here . Jessie , are you all right ? How long have you been here ? I think ... Four years . Maybe more . I ... I stopped counting . Four years ? I looked for you . I hoped you were somewhere along the river , and ... Shh , shh , shh , it 's all right . I 'm ... I 'm here , Jessie . I 'm here now . What have they been doing to you ? They 're messing with me , playing mind games , Make me think things about you . Me ? What have they been saying ? That you were with some guy on the river , Crap like that To try and break me , But it 's not working , So they try to drown me , But that 's not working either . So they 're basically screwed . God , Jessie , I 've missed you . I just want to wrap you up And not let go . Mattie ... I need to tell you . There was someone . Burton ? You know him ? Yeah . We 've met here on the river . When I woke up on the riverworld , It was insane . Richard saved me . Yeah , I saw it . I saw it all . He set out to explore the riverworld , And I joined him , But it was hoping to find you , Hoping to find out why we were here . I 'm sorry , mattie . It 's okay , Jess . I can 't imagine what you 've been through . We 're together now . Thank you . Right now we 've got to figure out a way To get out of this asylum . Mattie ! Mattie , they 're coming ! - Jessie ! - No , please ! Leave her alone ! Help ! No ! No , Jessie ! This is no pleasure cruise , Gentlemen ! Nyet ... We 're just travelling upriver to end the world . Now , get back to work and find our hidden friends . We 'll need that woman engineer before we reach the tower . Get up ! You know , I hate to give idiots of that magnitude credit , But they 're going to find us sooner or later . I should have disabled the engines When I had the chance . Oni . You ... Told me to find him and to help him . Who ? He will come . You are prepared to fight . Good . Oh , my God ! Oh , thank you . No problem , my friend . Antonio ? Last time I saw Antonio was on Sam 's boat , But listen , how 'd you get here ? I 'm not really sure . I-I remember going underwater . I woke up on the river Somewhere not far from here . I never thought I 'd see any of you again . You 're safe ... How do you do it , huh ? Just fht like that And sit there like it doesn 't even touch you ? We were fighting the good fight . There is no institution in human history I detest more than slavery , But try as I might , My eyes are inevitably drawn , Not to the joyful faces of the free , But the still expressions of the dead . Insha 'Allah . I tell myself That what happens on the battlefield Is the will of allah , But the truth is , They are dead , and I am not , And I prefer it that way . Look , you freed these people . They 're going to want to thank you , So why don 't you try and look like You think you did the right thing , eh ? Aw , hell . Why not ? Matt , don 't ! It appears you were correct , Mr. Ellman . You are hopelessly obstinate and disruptive . I 've been trying to explain To your friend , Mr. Ellman , That Mr. Burton is only doing What is necessary , What is right . It is the others Who are wrong . I 'm pleased to see that you at least agree with me . You 're wrong . I understand why richard wants to destroy this world , But I never agreed with his methods . He is a man from another era , One less sentimental than your own , But that does not negate his logic . It negates everything . He 's a dangerous man who has to be stopped . Jessie ... Don 't say any more . I see . Then as long as your attachment remains with Mr. Ellman , You are compromising yourself , And our efforts . Unless you convince me otherwise , Neither of you will ever see the light of day again . No , no ! I 'll be waiting , come find me . Come find me , Matthew . Phantom ... More treachery ! Not that you weren 't a gracious host , But I got to run . Your grailband , my dear . Pardon ? I 'm unbound , and I 'm famished . Destroying the world as we know it Can work up quite an appetite . What the hell 's in there ? The fusion reactor . It was given to Sam . We must be near a grailstone . It 's sending energy to the orb inside . I 've been thinking , Each grailstone we pass Is more powerful than the last . That means we have to stop Burton now , Before he gets to the source itself . Okay , let 's do this . No , no . It 's too dangerous . Here . She told me " he " would be waiting And would need my help , And she did not say which " he . " I hope you 're not disappointed . It is always a pleasure to serve a friend . Matthew . Okay , so what now ? I 'm going to help you . Where are we ? No idea . Tomoe , the caretaker , Did she say anything about Jessie ? No , nothing . She was with me in that prison , At least a vision of her . Did she speak to you ? She said she 'd be waiting . But where ? Too many questions obscure the path . What is it ? I think I 've been here before . When ? First , you must prostrate yourself . Forehead , palms , knees and toes touch the ground . You got to admire the man For sticking to his guns , Theologically speaking . Well , we 're going to need all the prayers we can get . Since climbing those mountains Looks to be suicide ? Basically . Then we 'd all be scattered , lost , And I 'd have no chance Of ever finding Antonio again . Don 't get me wrong . I 'm going . I just don 't like the odds . Well , if I played the odds , I 'd have been an attorney . Hell , even the real huck finn Had more sense than me . He ended up a justice of the peace . Time to roll the dice . Did I hear someone say " dice " ? Mr. Porter , you are too much . Roast squab with honey . This is a dish I haven 't sampled Since cairo . I 'm glad to be of service , With every dish you desire . Saboteurs ! The prisoners are escaping ! Get them ! Imbeciles ... You , go , save yourself ! No ! Listen , you saved me earlier . We 're in this together . Come on , let 's go ! That way . No , I can 't . I can 't go any further . No . No ! The bomb goes off and Burton wins ? Then we never get to see the people that we care about Ever again . No way . You think this is easy for me ? That ship was my life . There 's one way out of this . What , the suicide express ? Is that even real ? You have done it . Three times . No , I can 't do that . Not because I am afraid . I have to believe Sam and Youseff and the others Are coming for us . If we never went to the club that night , Hal would still be with me . And if pigs had wings , They would be eagles . But I think not . I think a pig ... Is just a pig . You know , I finally figured it out , Who you remind me of . When I was a student , there was a boy . He didn 't like the idea of women becoming engineers , So he came to my school , And he shot every woman he could find . I remember when he aimed his rifle at me , His eyes were blank . Reality didn 't matter . Other people 's lives didn 't matter , Only the puppet show inside his head . You have the same eyes . If you had seen what I have seen ... Your eyes would be dead , too . Do people actually do this for fun ? Well , it is an unassailable fact That , as a recreational activity , Mountain-climbing appeals chiefly to lunatics , Suicides , And the british . Like rugby . Are you trying to upstage me , Mr. Porter ? Not likely , Mark Twain . Do you want to stand here Talking all day , Or do you want to climb a mountain ? You know , sergeant mbaye , If I ever novelize our adventures , You will be facing a considerable rewrite . Matthew , where are we ? What is wrong ? This place , I don 't know what 's real anymore . Are you really here ? Am I ? Is any of this real ? Matthew ... I 've got an idea , Why don 't you And the rest of the blue man group Just kill each other And leave the rest of us the hell alone ? You are asking the wrong question . Her lies and illusions mean nothing . Ask her about what does matter . Is Jessie alive ? She is . Take me to her . You 're so damn powerful , take me to her now ! It 's all about using her . I finally figured it out . I 'm right , aren 't I ? You will find your friends Climbing that next mountain range . Burton is 400 miles to the north . You have only one more day to stop him . And how are we supposed to travel 400 miles In 24 hours ? A ship ... A ship that flies . A zeppelin . This doesn 't bother you ? Being used as puppets ? Fighting a war we barely understand ? Saving the world , Stopping evil , Rescuing the woman you love ? I have fought wars for less . That 's the first thing I 've heard in days That makes any sense . Come on . I got you . Yeah , come on . We 've got a long way to go . Come on . You 're killing me . Sam ... Sam ! What do you want from us ? It doesn 't make any sense ! You 're a coward ! You 're a murderer ! You 're a yellow son of a bitch ! I think ... I think I 'll ... Just sit here for a while and ... Look out at the world . Come on , gentlemen . Let 's find Antonio and the others . I want my damn boat back . Okay , pal , sorry to do this , But the lady and I need a ride . You the pilot ? Then you 're going to help us Get on that machine , okay ? Now , I 'm going to take my hand away , But if you scream ... Let 's just say The little lady doesn 't like loud noises . Okay ? You folks in some kind of trouble , Or are you looking for some ? Maybe a little of both . Aces . I love a good dust-up . Eddie chung , nice to meet you ... - Edward ! - Hey , boss ! Is everything all right ? Yeah , yeah , just picked up a couple hitchhikers here . Guys , this is ludwig durr , The man who built the hindenburg . Matt Ellman . Wie geht 's ? This is my friend , Tomoe Gozen . Tomoe Gozen ? I am a student of the ancient warriors . Hercules , achilles , Even alexander the great , But to meet Tomoe Gozen is indeed a fantastic honor . Hajimemashite ! Hajimemashite . Come ! To the herumferzen , ja ? It 's a dead end . Dead end ... No food , no water , And now nowhere to go ? Well , on the bright side , We 're already dead ! All right , all right , we ... I suppose we 'll just have to double back , Look for another route . Double back ? Yes . Double back ... Or we could fly . Now , is that some kind of senegalese aphorism ? Faith in allah will give us wings ? Or maybe mohammed can move this damn mountain Out of our way ? No , what he meant was ... We could fly . We could fly . Hello ! We can fly ! There they are . I see them . Dead slow . You miss me , brother ? Look , man , don 't be hugging me , man . Watching you die shook me up . Oh , well , I 'm sorry , man . Next time I die , I 'll tell you to look away . All right , dumbass . So , we catch up to Burton and those guys , And then what ? Then we take the boat back . Oh , okay , And how exactly are you planning to do that ? Repairs complete , captain . All ahead full , comrade Evgeny . We have a lot of time to make up . Yes , sir . And this is the observation room . It is as precise a replication of the original designs As I could create Under these difficult conditions . Well , that clock 's still a few minutes off There , ludwig . The clock is not off , Edward . The planet is off . She 's a most magnificent vessel , mein herr . Ludwig , in your travels , How much of the riverworld have you seen ? Oh , only a small portion . - Danke . - Bitte . The planet is so vast . By my calculations , It is over 100 times the size of the earth . 100 times bigger ? Well , the almighty did a pretty good job Of making man feel puny on earth . What do the gods intend here ? That seems to be the question of the day . What the hell happened on earth ? I mean , I 've heard that it was blown up Or obliterated by someone or something , So if anybody 's heard anything , Now 's the time to share . It is possible that there was a ... An event . As a man who makes a modest living Toiling as a wordsmith , I would have to say that if the lovely blue planet , Which had been my home for some 75 years , Was suddenly and irrevocably reduced To ash and cinder , The word " event " Is hardly the one I would choose to employ . Pardon me , But it is an acceptable scientific term . Besides , we have no proof , Only speculation , That the earth was attacked And destroyed . I knew it . I knew I wasn 't killed By my downstairs neighbor leaving the gas on again . Attacked by whom ? I have no answer for that . If you will excuse me . I must speak to Edward . The starboard rudder is off by two degrees . If you don 't mind . Not at all . Enjoy . She might be gone . Mother earth . She may be no more . You seem troubled , Matthew . I do ? What were you looking for Out there ? I don 't know . Answers ... Guidance . You are trying too hard . Just ... Be . Yeah ? My mother used to say that . Well , not exactly that . She 'd tell me to stop thinking so much . Be Matthew . The rest will follow . Do not worry . I did not come here to interfere . Good . So how about you drop me off Somewhere inside . I want to be sure that you grasp The seriousness of what you 're about to do . Oh , I 'm getting the serious part . You will condemn yourself and your kind To an eternity of torture , Including your beloved Jessie . What do you know about Jess ? In fact , what the hell do you know about anything human ? Yes , you are correct . I know little of your kind , But I do have the advantage To be able to foretell certain events . Based on our projections ... Screw your projections . You want to stop me from killing Burton , Throw me off , right here , right now . Please ... You know we are only able to intercede On a limited basis . Oh , really ? So back in the bat cave That was only a limited version Of water-boarding ? I only came here today to suggest that you turn back . What lies ahead will haunt you and your race for a very long time . * * * a strange woman in a hooded robe That seems we all have the same mysterious benefactor And the same enemies . Burton 's caretaker was just here . One of the salvations We had an interesting conversation on the starboard wing . What ? Don 't worry , we didn 't bend anything . I 'm gonna have to now assume that sir dick knows we 're coming after him . And he will be prepared . You have my solemn oath that I will never abandon this ship . On my life . One thing is for certain ... It shall be one hell of a contest . On the rocks . Bring her around . Bring her around . Get out . I was surprised to get your message . I trust you know what this means for us . I hear too many sweets can kill you . The captain 's not here . He 's busy . Yes , I am aware of that . But a big strong man like you must be hungry , no ? You know he 'll kill me if he saw me take any of this . Of course , he 'll kill me anyway . Still , I want to be around a little longer . Hey , guys , come here , have a look . There she is . Dead ahead . Time to take back that which is mine . My apologies , that which is ours . No , Sam , she 's all yours , And I 'm not talking about the boat . I thank you , sir . What is that ? The dark tower . I 've heard of it . I was never sure it really existed . The dark tower ? Otherwise known as the source . The source from which this river flows , the source of all things along its banks , both good and bad . Gentlemen , I believe a new day is upon us . Captain , sir , you might want to come see this . Friends of yours ? If I had friends that could fly , Why would I steal this thing ? Shoot them ! Shoot them out of the sky ! Rocket ! Keep firing . We 're hit ! Port-side engine ! Feathering prop now ! Eddie , we need to stop them from firing . You need to get us down there fast . Getting down there fast will not be a problem . Well , how about stopping ? Is that going to be a problem ? Okay , now I 'm mad . Bring them down , gentlemen . Whatever you have to do , bring that damn thing down . Clever little minx . A beautiful ship . Boss ! I don 't know how much longer this thing 'll hold together . All right , now , what did you call This technique again , Mr. Porter ? Jumping ! Okay , Sam , it 's not a riverboat , But you 're still the captain . What do you say ? Seems like a damn fool idea to me ! And that 's exactly why I like it ! Who 's next ? Okay , let 's go . Go , Eddie . Save yourself . Ludwig , what about you ? If I am to die , I prefer to go facing into the wind . Just like old times , huh ? Ain 't no thing . We 'll use this . Don 't rush me . This takes time . You okay ? I seem to be afraid of heights . Keep your eyes on me the whole time , you don 't let go until I say . Okay ? What about our two little mice ? What about them ? Ludwig , we 're coming in fast . Drop it ! Allahakbar ! Brace yourself ! * * * When this is over , I am going to have to teach you how to fight . When this is over , I never want to see a sword again . Just like a man To only show up for dessert . My darling , You never cease to amaze me . Don 't get sentimental . I 'm only backing the winner , As always . I assure you , I have no time for sentiment . I did a little baking for the boys . Allegra Braccioforte ... - Amore mio ... You make me crazy . When 's this going to end ? Give me a shovel . Matthew , Burton . - Help ! - Help us ! Fire ! Help us ! Come on ! Inside ! Help us , please ! Amelie ? Matthew ? Down here ! Over here . Amelie , get out of there ! Where 's Simon ? I thought he was with you . Have you seen Burton ? We are too late . - Matt ! - Brother , you scared me . What happened ? I missed the boat , literally and figuratively . I came down in the trees over there , and I just ... I just knocked myself out . That 's a bad one . I 'm sorry you 've been dragged into this . Let 's get you out of here ... Just stay here till I get back , okay ? Matthew ! I am coming with you . Tomoe ... It might not be the best idea . It was not a question . Our fates are entangled somehow . I want to see how it ends . Get out of here ! If something goes wrong up there , Or it goes bad down here , Don 't sweat it . We 'll see each other in the next life , right ? Okay ? Right ? Right . Go on ! Tomoe , behind you ! Lay still , lay still . Burton ! Lay still . Yoshinaka ... Never would have let one soldier Delay his mission , Not even me . You know , I got to tell you , This yoshinaka guy of yours , He doesn 't sound that great . You are a true warrior , Matthew ... And as such , Never allow the indulgence of self-doubt To cloud your vision . He 's not with us . Well , where is he ? Where 's Hal ? I am sorry , But somewhere down the river , There 's always a chance he may be there . I just want this nightmare to end . Well , you may get your wish . What the hell ... No , stop . Jesse ? You said he wouldn 't be here . Who ? Who are you talking about ? You ! I don 't understand , Jess . Is this you ? Are you real ? Or is this another one of their chess games ? Chess ... One of my favorites . Mine , too . Your move . No , his . I 'm sorry , Matt . So , this was all planned ? A charade ? Everything in the prison cell ? Why ? You weren 't supposed to be here . Why couldn 't you just give up , Stop looking for me ? We tried to tell you . Does he really mean this much to you ? Matt , this isn 't about him . I know you , Jess . There is nothing that would ever turn you To something like this . Never , not without him . Don 't fool yourself . Look , this world isn 't a dream , It 's a nightmare ... One that has to stop . Matt ... I love you . I will always love you . Jess ... This world is our home now . It 's all that 's left . Everything else is gone . If you destroy it , there will be nothing . We will be nothing . Look at me . Jess . Look at me . I can 't . Why are you doing this ? You ever heard about rat-baiting ? In the east end , The common folk would catch rats And make them fight each other for sport . That 's what the riverworld is . It 's a vast barrel filled to the brim With the most dangerous vermin ever created , Humans , Battling each other for someone else 's pleasure . It 's a game ! And it 's one I intend to end , Now , on my terms . So , it 's a game , and you don 't want to play . I get that . I 'm not sure I want to play , But what gives you the right To make that decision for everyone else ? It 's the only way ! There 's no escape . Finally , they gift us with their presence . If there 's a God in this place I sincerely hope he 's on our side Or impartial at the worst . I thought you didn 't believe in God . I don 't . I 'm merely thinking of the rest of you . Our lords and masters . You want to save this place ? Then do something ! Stop me ! No , because you are cowards . You are murderous cowards ! Come on , Jess ! Are you with me , girl ? I don 't know anymore . How many days ? How many days did you have with her ? I had eight weeks . 56 days . That 's it . That 's all I was given . But you know something ? I 'll take it . 200 . 200 ... and 35 days ... 235 days and today . Those memories ... You want them wiped out ? Obliterated ? Richard ... Please . You are right . You are both ... Right . I 'm being selfish and irrational , And perhaps the rest of the rats Deserve a chance at such happiness , And I am not a hero , Or a builder , or ... Someone who makes things better . See , I 'm a different kind of rat . I 'm a biter , And I 'm damned well going to bite ! Burton , no ! Run , Getty . See you again , brother . I am just gathering * * * It is so good to see you my friend . You too . How long have you been here ? Just one day . Have you seen any of the others ? You are the first , Which feels right . It makes me happy . Do you know what happened ? It is all a bit confusing . Do you ? I thought we were at the end of the world , But apparently not . I honestly don 't know if it was all a dream . Is that not how life is ? But hearing you again , I think we may have been dreaming the same dream . You were hurt , right ? Yes . And you had found Jessie . That 's right . I did . But then what ? Everyone is waiting for you . Oh , you ... Ugh , stop hugging me ! Dude ! I dropped a tear for you ! It 's good to see you , brother . It 's good to see you , too , man . We 've got lots to talk about . Matthew ... Assalamu alaikum . Welcome back , my brother . It 's good to see you , my friend . Yes . Captain Sam Clemens , at your service . Sam ... Well ... Here 's to old friends . Jessie ... Where is she ? We were hoping ... * * * hoping you might know more about that . No , I just got here myself . She 's bound to be here soon , right ? How long have you been here ? Just long enough To get the boat back in ship shape . I remain determined to go back to the source , To unravel this mystery , Claim this world as our own . Is this the same boat ? Not exactly . So you 've been here long enough to build a new one ? Aw , got great sea legs , this girl . You survived , and we didn 't , is that it ? None of us survived , Matt . Sam and I were just the first ones back . We 've been collecting everyone else since then . How long ? It 's been eight years . Eight years ? Son , if history has taught us anything , If this place has educated us in the ways of this life ... We all have to know there is hope . Matt , there 's aloways gonna be hope . You did well , Matthew Ellman . I didn 't do anything . It may not have seemed like much , but ... You saved this world . By forcing Burton off the tower , The vessel 's force field prevented the blast From fusing with the planet 's power source . I didn 't force him to do anything He wasn 't already prepared to do . A sequence of events leads to a consequence . You were principal to that sequence . Without you , The result would have been catastrophic . We all died . You 're here now , aren 't you ? Not all of us . Where is she ? I don 't know . You 're lying . Like you , Jessie has no grailband . I can 't track her . Then how ... You can track my friends . So as long as I 'm with them , You know where to find me . Your sense of loyalty Was one of the reasons why we chose you . I didn 't ask to be chosen . In fact , I 'd rather be unchosen . When the time is right , Matthew , Once you have fulfilled your destiny . What destiny ? I just want to find Jessie ! And so you shall , my friend . And so you shall . Aw , hell , it 's not like there 's any hurry . We 're going to be here a while , And that 's a certainty , A damned dead certainty if ever there was one . Full speed ahead , Mr. Youseff ! We 've got a long river to run .

Yes So this is the place Kaho and Tokura went They 're Masaru Seven and Dasha here I know that Even though we know each other But I 'm Gondo here . Alright Do you know ? This game was created before we were born Ever since long time ago THE WORLD has a rumor like the urban legends Setting ? No . Something else that get into the game Legend about something that shouldn 't be in this world There 's a mystery girl in this legend A girl ? Most people had already forgotten this legend But some of the core players think that it really happened So I saw that spirit ? I think it 's possible . But we can 't make a conclusion now Right ? Isn 't it creepy ? good morning . Have you seen the news ! ? No Whales again ? There are people who became unconscious playing THE WORLD And he 's at Kurumi Cybercafe ! Don 't you think it 's creepy ? So THE WORLD is the cause ? I want to know that too It is not related at all THE WORLD will be blamed if this continues That 's the problem Yeah ... That 's true ... I think this is nothing much . those who scold are those who don 't play games . don 't laugh . did everyone see ? Heard that someone was unconscious due to THE WORLD . What ? Eh ? right ? then they collapsed . that is quite intriguing . What is that ? Hmm ... The ghost lady that Yuuki-san saw and this unconscious news ... I think they are related . Eh ? You think too much . We shall meet at the old place today . See you . There are unconscious cases related to THE WORLD happened before . A mysterious girl appeared too . The girl is called ... Aura . Aura . I hope they are not related . see you . You always play game here ? This place is very soothing . Although it is a little cold now . my parents are annoying . Grandfather ? Sora ... Hmm ? ' is that possible ? but that seems to be impossible . Possible ? she told us to be careful . Foreigner ? From where ? No idea . Suppose to be some lost tourist . I will take a look . Don 't go . Father you can 't solve anything too even you go . Why ? The barrier of language . Barrier ? The God of Light in the Northern Myths . Balder ? Balder means this . Tomo ... how about Gondo ? Gondou Kujira . What ? What is that ? You ? What are you ? Cheng is the one who put up this characters . What ? Character is not created by yourself ? Unbelievable . Is it weird ? You are saying such things again . I shall leave . Do you have time ? No problem . but this is only data . so not romantic . I have noticed something lately . Even the world called THE WORLD is a fusion of the data ... we who are inside of it have created character . Normally those who said " l " will be referred as " Me " ... those who said " Me " will change into " Myself ' . Even the tone was altered ... it became annoyed . Do you understand what I am saying ? Perhaps . isn 't this an absolute ? Absolute things will tend to be forgotten much easily . Perhaps . Then ? I ... Like ... Yuuki ... Ah ... I am sorry to trouble you . Eh ? Sorry sorry . Where were we just now ? Is it real ? Tanaka ... Why ... I want ... Good morning . Good morning . Eh ? What ? Nothing . Good . Good morning . Tokura-san was confessed for a few times . What do you think about that ? that 's quite ridiculous . make them hand in some equipments ? I 'm joking . Eh ? Somebody confessed to you ? How could that be possible ? I used a male character . That 's true . Wait . I will bring you to level up . It 's alright . I want to work on my own today . I see . Ok . Don 't force yourself . What is that ? Ah ... That time ... Ah ... What ? Ah ... Ah ... how are you ? not good . the server is down again . what is wrong ... Is that so ? so sorry ... You were in THE WORLD just now ? so sorry ... Yes ... but ... can 't sleep ? You won 't know when will the maintenance ends . Better to sleep early today . Are you listening ? Yes . so that will be . See you . Good morning . My name is David . Good morning . I am not some suspicious person . Sora Yuuki-san . The PC name in THE WORLD is Kite . Am I right ? Allow me to go straight-forward . We will need your help no matter what now . please contact me . See you . Yesterday 's server down and emergency maintenance isn 't has nothing to do with you . You should realized that . my nose feels better . Thank you for that . Ok ... That 's why I said ... Suspicious ... Very suspicious ... what is NAB ? network management . Found it . this is it . Owh ? Perhaps this is the civilian version of the Echelon system . I see . what is Echelon system ? monitoring the internet data usage for the military purposes . Perhaps that is a system . This is not important at all . What should I do ? If that guy is someone from there ... Then this is not a problem that a middle school student can handle . Do you have any thoughts ? this thing . Eh ? That is strange . What is it ? That ... I can 't log in to the database of the County Library . Maintaining ? No . That ... the online library seems to be collapsed . same as that . this is impossible . However no maintenance is called up ... See you . Tanaka-san . Do you have something to tell me ? What thing ? Me ? I thought game is the same as reality . Oh yes . I think they are the same . we are so real while we were playing games . didn 't you ? Did I ? However ... They are not identical . Such as ? I am more relaxed . Really ? I would say it out in THE WORLD . Something like that . Because this is not a game after all ? I think this is the reason . Though I felt that way ... perhaps ... Eh ? Perhaps we are more closely related than we thought . what is that ? Don 't change the topic . I didn 't mean that . did I make you unhappy ? Whatever . Yuuki-san . Today you will play THE WORLD ? I will wait for you at the same old place . Geez . Hmm ? Players of the internet game THE WORLD who are found unconscious ... has reached the number of 7 . has begun investigating its connections . CyberConnect company to stop the game . Good morning . Good morning . I ... am in the office ... I ... heard ... What is it ? Tanaka-san ... is unconscious . I heard that he fainted while playing game . you mean THE WORLD ? Perhaps . Is it true ? I heard the teachers are discussing this . they put on a face of " Oh My God " . Tomohiko ... is it true ? That is bad . Please do not worry . His body is well . Just that his mind is not . He was waiting for me last night . Don 't come here . do you have it with you ? Could you please tell us the details ? your friend ? I understand the situation well . Sora-san . Eh ? Including the incident that you met Aura ... right ? yes there is . your friend ... right ? It is the mutated Virus ( Virus Bug ) . Mutated Virus ? ( Virus Bug ) That is a virus spread out from a company who intended to sell their Anti-virus software . Virus Bug has developed in a unimaginable speed . it invaded the human brain via the electrical signals . I heard that some players at THE WORLD was devoured by the Virus Bug . we NAB has taken our action . Even you said so ... don 't you will revive Tanaka ? only Sora-san will be able to do this . didn 't she ? I 'm afraid that is the avatar of Aura . Or a seed . Seed ? I shall use another way to explain so that you will understand . Aura is an artificial intelligence who is able to clear up the internet soley . she can 't fight the unimaginable speed of mutation of the Virus Bug . Aura has no choice but to force herself to undergo rapid evolution ... she has chosen Sora-san . Why has she chosen Sora ? Your nerve impulses are identical with the wave action of Aura . Aura hopes to connect your thoughts and personal emotion ... to make her Al undergo rapid evolution . Have a look . The data has inflated to an abnormal stage . Almost reaching a stage to complete fusion . That ... she will evolve ? That 's right . Aura can 't move now . you have to hand it to her by in-person . Sora ? We need your help . so dangerous ... If I see Aura ... then Tanaka can be saved ? that is the only way ? Ah . Ah . How are you ? I am good . Then should it be " Who are you " ? the battle begins . We will count on you . I see . CC company made a pirated version of Aura 's strength . Or that is something similar to mass production of Aura . pirated version . they will sell it as the Anti-Virus software . Just like having their own Virus program and put in on the net ... such a bad guy . What is that ? Setting the fire and vanishing it . Self-directed . they are destroyed by the Virus the set out themselves ? CC company will delete all data . what will happen to those unconscious ? I am sorry . the problems will settle ? things will get worse . Until no turning back ? Not only that ... I heard that father has some incident . What did you say ? I am not sure of the situation . What ? then the factory 's production line . So ... Are you going ? Yes . Can you do that ? Yes . I ... have to do it . That is alright . right ? That 's right . We have grandfather in our house . when can you come back again ? We are introducing this product this time . Didn 't you buy a lot of tools due to DIY ? Organizing and maintaining them is a pain . sharpener ; a total of seven in 1 . He said change the listener . husband . Incidents regarding the internet are happening all around the world . also the traffic and transportation . The chaos involved the finance and public relations department .

We made it . arrived ! so I came to help . Kaho . what a mess . I am David . the data within the server period is actively changing . there might be a huge Virus Bug mistake anytime . let 's talk about what should we do now . some strange data transaction was observed . the black box of THE WORLD is there . Black box ? CC . Company can 't decipher the data . As long as we are able to reach there ... we will meet Aura ? That is it . how are we supposed to go ? I have something good . This boat belongs to grandfather ? Great . you can have one too . That 's impossible . David . What is it ? look here . The data shows that THE WORLD is fulled of mutated data . It can 't operate normally . or ... I bet the mutated data is increasing . David . approaching ... Wah ... It has begun . go ! my turn ! This is too bad . please . I need some help . it 's me . understood . This will do . Hey . Eh ? are you serious ? eh ? now ... Yes ... What ? Understood . we will meet there . Hey . Look at Balder 's twitter ... Huh ? Unconscious means ... Because of THE WORLD ? isn 't it ? let 's find out the reason together . Are you stupid ? That is so dangerous . But I want to go . I have received help from Gondo and Balder . Use the best equipments . Then send an e-mail to everyone in the team . Yes ... Hey ... Eh ? CyberConnect Company ... server has became very unstable ... All players ... it is impossible . Log off now . climb to somewhere far . Huh ? Sora ! Sora ! Ah ! Sorry to keep you waiting . We are saved . Is everyone good ? Yes . Sora ... Sora are you alright ? Sora ... assault formation ! assist the right starboard . prepare to attack . Alright . start ! Can 't get her . Is it for real ? where are you ? here . Alright . Thank you . Sora . great that you are alright . I understood . can I still solve the problems ? The invasion of the Virus Bug is faster than we thought . But our preparation is almost complete . It is still not too late . Increasing the volt for the server by using all the PC other than Kite 's . but there should have 1 minute for Kite to operate alone . reach there . We will send you there . Don 't worry . please help my granddaughter . since he had said it . I shall work hard too . let 's go . Geez . let 's go . Not done yet ? I am back . Just on time . Kite 's pet is used as the connector . Using Cheng ? That pet 's OS is ? Probably 2 versions ago . Really ? There might be a problem . But think of a way to get through it . I will upload some programs in your pet . give me a signal . Understood . This is bad . Anywhere is alright . I will settle the rest myself . Data has uploaded . I 'm counting on you . Go . Tanaka . Not even 30 seconds yet . Uh-oh . That is it ! Sora ! Do your best ! Aura ? aren 't you ? Aura . Please save everyone . Please save THE WORLD . Everyone tried their best . Then only I am able to reach here . I ... Perhaps we are more closely connected than we thought we were . I ... want to be connected with everyone forever . It is open . It is open . Hey ! Great ! Yes . the cyber pinch related to CyberConnect and THE WORLD . For more information will have to wait for the authority 's report . those who were unconscious have all recovered . further investigations will be carried out . Old-Take ... Uh-oh ... Hey ... Let 's go . Yes . Ok . Let 's have some takoyaki . Alright . Why ? You didn 't realize ? Uwah ! Again ! What a pity ... Sora ... What happened to the guy called David ? he said he is going back to United States for some data analysis . Yet he sent an e-mail stating he will be back . What is that ? isn 't that a little bit fast ? That 's right . do you know ? THE WORLD is resuming its activity next month . I heard from Kaho . They are enjoying themselves a lot . right ? I am not sure . What should I do ? In that case ... Yes . That 's true . what should I do ? That . I have said it on the internet . But I think it will be better if I make it clear in the reality too . What ? No ... I said ... I ... I like you . Eh ? Wait ... That ... Huh ? I said it before ... Eh ? You never received it ? Yes . You see . It is finally here . I 'm sorry . Eh ? Alright . Let 's go . Tanaka . Let 's go back .

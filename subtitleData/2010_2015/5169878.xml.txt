I was scouted by the Galactic Union Police . What happened at Mars ? ! How did you survive ? What happened to Touya ? ! I can explain the details later . a high spec ship from the planet Bird . Seeing all this makes your ' Space Sheriff ' talk seem bizarrely plausible ... Hey ! Hands off the controls ! Who ... are you ? Geki 's partner ! And your relation to Geki is ... ? His childhood friend . Why do you ask ? you two . Itsuki ... Some data was stolen from SARD 's security room . I 'm more worried about what happened to Touya ! Itsuki . This is really important .

It was information on the Axion meteorite that the Oyama Energy Lab retrieved 20 years ago . { tlc on the meteorite name } { DOKO HE YUKU NO DAROU KA TOKI NO MEIZU } Shelly ! Okay ! We 're headed to the Oyama Energy Laboratory . and he speculated it could be the first step towards the creation of wormholes . That 's what Touya 's work was based on . And I 've spent the last year going over that data ... Being able to create a wormhole would let you defy space and time . You could even travel to the edge of the universe . Touya talked about it all the time . I see ... then . I thought I might be able to make his dream come true . what happened to Touya ? What happened when you got to Mars ? that Touya and I were on ... It was sent to Mars to observe a distortion of light that was believed to indicate a wormhole ...

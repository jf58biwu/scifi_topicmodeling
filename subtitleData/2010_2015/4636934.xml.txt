 I 've got Isaac . He 's made contact . Female . Early 20s . They 're on the move . The girl seems to be leading . Gary , can you get me an image ? Uh , yeah , okay . I got her . See the way she 's moving ? She 's an Alpha , too . She 's processing her environment somehow . Isaac Hale is an assassin , right ? My guess is she 's his tracker . She finds the target and our man closes the deal . I don 't get it . Sullivan said that Red Flag leaders have been vanishing off the grid all week . Something 's up . Well , he 's our only lead . So keep an eye on him , but don 't engage . There 's a pawn shop . We can sell it here . No . No . These places rip you off . Baby , you 're hurting . We need the money . No , come on . Let 's go . Let 's go . You have something of mine . You can piss off ! Don 't , Will ! Don 't ! Don 't ! Come on ! Don 't make me kill you . It makes me tired and then I get cranky . He found his target . Where ? They 're down the alley ! Left ! Go left ! Where ? Come on ! Ah ! Ah ! Will ! I know you 're a couple of brain-dead junkies . But for once , be smart , give it back . He said piss off . Your fault . Ah . Cover 's blown . We were supposed to be following him . Ah . You killed him . Danielle . No . Nina , push her to come with us . Ah ! Ah . Rachel , go after Isaac . It 's okay . It 's okay . Cameron , follow Isaac . I have to go after that girl . What 's so special about the girl ? She 's my daughter . Don 't take no for an answer There 's no telling where we 've been Because people don 't understand , understand , understand People don 't understand People like me I knew Rosen had a daughter and they didn 't get along , but he never told me she was an Alpha . She just made you cry , just came out of nowhere ? When she touched me , it felt like I 'd lost my best friend . It 's like she can force people to feel whatever she wants . She sure as hell didn 't seem too happy to see Rosen . If my kid ever looked to me that way ... I lost them . Damn it . You lost someone ? Yeah . I 'm not the one who flew in there like Jackie Chan and blew our cover . Hey , I 'm not sure if you noticed , but he was killing people . Gary , you got anything ? Yeah . Danielle Sofia Rosen . She ran away from home at 17 . She was arrested ... No , look , not about Rosen 's daughter , about Isaac Hale . No , I lost him when Rachel did . But don 't worry , I 'm multi-tasking . We should circle the neighborhood . See if Rachel can track a scent . Okay . Just don 't drive by that Thai place , okay ? It totally kills my sense of smell . Hello , where is everybody ? Who 's manning the fort ? It 's not a fort , Bill . It 's a bad metaphor . Forts have ramparts and cannons . We have desks and carpet . You 're sitting in the boss ' chair ? What , are you charge now ? Where is everybody ? Yeah , Bill , I am in charge when no one else is here . What are you doing here anyway ? You 're sick . You should be resting . Six more days , not including the weekend . I 'm fine . The doctor said that that infarction actually normalized me , so ... Yeah , no more overdrive , no more under-drive , I 'm optimal . Bill . The rest was only precautionary . Yeah . Infarction . No . Come on . Gary , not now , listen . Fart . Listen , we 've got to focus . I 'm being immature . You know we 've been trying to figure out why the Red Flag leadership has been off the grid , right ? Yeah , it 's an ongoing investigation . And you 're interrupting it . No , I 'm laying at home , right ? Sitting on my ass and I 'm thinking I may actually have a possible lead . You know how that invisible girl , uh , Griffin , said that I need to find out who or what Stanton Parish was , right ? Yeah , well , go and look it up on your computer , Bill . It 's easy , use a search engine . Gary , listen to me . I already tried that . I couldn 't find anything . Don 't put your fingers in my stream . Okay , listen . Then I got to thinking , why did Red Flag try so hard to erase our MK Ultra files ? What if the secret to Stanton Parish is on Dr. Rosen 's cloud drive ? Bill , you want me to look through the cloud drive ? Uh , yeah , exactly . Well , I can 't . I 'm already multi-tasking . No , Gary , you can do it all . I 'm looking for Isaac and I 'm tracking Dani . Who the hell is Dani ? There 's Dani . Dr. Rosen ? Dr. Rosen ? Yeah . Can I have my key ? Yeah , I got your daughter . She 's at the Baltimore Hotel . It 's a no-star hotel . There 's only one review . It says , " Don 't stay here . " Dani ? Danielle ? Danielle ? Are you in there ? Danielle ? Dani , if you 're in there , please open the door . I thought I was hallucinating . Oh , you 're not , as far as I can tell . I don 't want you here . Well , I ... I don 't want you here . I want you to come with me . No . It 's no use , Dad . Dani ... Dani , you 're in pain . Just leave me alone . I know you 're always hurting . After you use your ability . I don 't care . Will you please just let me help you ? Oh , what are you going to do ? Give me another therapy session ? Dani , run ! Run . Come on . Get off of me ! Dani ! Dani ! Come on ! Come on ! Two for one . Oh , God . Oh . Nobody had to die . You could have just given it back . Dani , will you sit down for a second , please ? I ... I can check your vitals . Please , Dad , I am not going to make you cry . At least not from my ability . So , what do you want now ? Painkillers again ? Or what ? Oh , come on , don 't tell me we 're going to have an intervention . Just trying to help . Not bad . So , what is it ? Lamotrigine . Lamotrigine ? That 's an anticonvulsant , among other things . Yeah , I know . I mean , it 's not what I 'm on but it 's what works best . Better than the Ritalin you used to give me , even better than the trazodone . Better than the Oxycontin , which by the way I did take a few hours ago , just in case you were going to ask me to give you a urine sample next . Just to warn you ... Okay . Okay . Fine . So Lamotrigine . Look , why don 't you just write me a prescription , put it on your insurance and I 'll be out of your life again . I don 't think so . I 'm sorry about that boy . Yeah , well , he was hardly a boy . He was 34 years old . Dani , I need to know why that man was chasing you . Finally , there 's the real question . His name is Isaac Hale . He kills people for a living . He was part of a group called Red Flag . Red Flag ? What is that , one of your punk bands ? You know , Dani , there are no rules that say you can 't tell the truth every once in a while . There it is . That 's what I remember , that disapproving look . Sorry to interrupt . Lee ? He 's all yours . You have a time , tomorrow morning , 7 : 00 a.m. Wait a minute , what exactly are we talking about here ? We 've been monitoring Red Flag 's communications ever since their leaders started dropping off the grid . Yes . We don 't know what they 're planning or where but we have a timeline now so we are on the clock . Lee . Look , Kathy , I don 't think you understand , the young woman in my office ... Yeah , I know , she 's your daughter . That 's why I 'm not questioning why you killed our best lead , but you did . And now I need you to set aside your family business ... Red Flag wanted something from my daughter so badly that they were willing to kill her for it . If your daughter can help us with this case , great . But if not , you 're a therapist , compartmentalize . I know you 're concerned , honey , but I wouldn 't have come to work if I wasn 't feeling better , right ? You know that about me . Bill . I found ... I don 't need ... I don 't need the pills , babe . I 'm at work . I 'm busy , okay ? Bill , come on ... Huh . You 're drinking pills . Bill , come on . I found him . You asked me to do this . Babe , I got to go . I 'll go ... Yes , I 'll take it easy . Yeah , you found who ? Here . Stanton Parish . He was a who . And you were right . He was on the cloud drive . So he was a scientist who died in 1974 . Yeah . And he worked for the government for MK Ultra and before he died he wrote this , Bill . It 's a manifesto about Alphas and back then they weren 't even called Alphas . " Neuro-dominant humanity represents " the greatest potential advancement for civilization " since man first walked upright , which is why those who fear change " will inevitably seek to eliminate us . " He was an Alpha ? Yeah . And he was a good writer . Anna writes stuff like this . Stanton Parish is Red Flag 's favorite dead author . Invisible girl made it sound like this guy is the key to everything so there 's got to be more , Gary . Bill , look how much I printed . No , I know . This is a lot . There 's got to be more . Please keep digging . Yeah , I don 't ... I don 't think I like hard work . Dani , I need you to tell me the truth about what happened . We don 't have time for games . Of course we don 't have time for games . You never had time for games . Blood tests , psych tests , EEGs , sure . But games . Why don 't you just stick some electrodes to my forehead , Dad ? Just for old times ' sake . Tell me how I 'm feeling . That was 15 years ago and ... So I should be over it ? Is that what you 're saying ? You 're in serious trouble , Danielle . You need to calm down , tell me what happened so I can help you . So , you want to help ? You know what Will would do when I was upset ? Bring me flowers . Get me whatever drug I needed , even if he had to steal it . But then again he loved me , so ... Well , I love you , too . Okay . You want to know what Red Flag was after ? These . I took them from some guy at a meeting . Thought they were rubies , but turns out they 're just glass . Hands up . Oh , I don 't ... I don 't like ... Ow . Huh . Anna ! It 's good to see you . You always say that we can 't meet up , but I ... I wanted to see you again . It 's good to see you . It has all your sounds on there . That 's very cool , Anna . I 've missed our conversations . Yeah . I 've missed them , too . Uh , Doctor ... Oh , yeah , okay . I wish you were here for another reason . That quote you sent me , Gary . Oh , yeah . " Society 's acceptance is a prison disguised as a palace . " Where did you find that ? It 's Stanton Parish . Is he your favorite writer , Anna ? Gary , Stanton Parish is a very dangerous man . You shouldn 't be asking questions about him . Anna , you said " is . " Stanton Parish is dead . He died 30 years ago . He 's Red Flag 's favorite dead author . You need to go now , Gary . Anna , why do I have to go now ? I just got here . Why do I have to ... Anna , don 't make me go . It was difficult for me to come and see you . Anna , I had to be sneaky . Ow . Anna . Dani , you did the right thing giving us the necklace . Thank you . But we should talk . Will you sit down , please ? The past is past . Okay . You know , I think you 'll find that I 'm a pretty different person than I was 15 years ago . Are you ? To me you seem to be pretty much exactly the same . Except now you have a whole team of people to play with . Don 't talk about what you don 't know . Pushing buttons . You have no idea what 's going on here . Dad , you always say I lie , but there are different kinds of lying . You can tell people what they want to hear . You can , uh , pretend that you care . And then there 's outright manipulation . And when have I ever manipulated you ? " Camel mealie . " Chamomile tea ? Whenever Mom would get angry at you for locking yourself in a room with your lab work , you would come to me and say , " Dani , Mommy 's sad ... " Please bring her a cup of " camel mealie " tea . Right , no , I remember . But Dani , that 's not ... So I would bring her the tea and I would sit on her lap and I would stroke her arm . And she 'd feel better . Empathic contagion , right ? Isn 't that what you call it ? Right , that 's right . Well , that was me . I was Mommy 's little helper . But , you know , that 's not exactly the way it happened . That was ... That was before I knew about your ability . You 're right , Dad . You 're always right . Except with the tea , I did that until Mom and I moved out . When I was 12 . You knew what I could do when I was nine . Hey , Doc . Doc ! Listen ... You okay ? Yeah . It was a mistake to bring my daughter here . Listen , we have 12 hours to figure out what Red Flag is up to . No , no , listen to me . That 's what we should be working on . Doc , listen to me . Listen to me . We haven 't cracked it yet , but Gary and I just found something that is huge . You need to see it now . All right . So , we looked for the name but all we found was a book by a dead guy . And then , when I asked Anna about it she just lied to me . Gary , you spoke with Anna ? I expressly told you not to do that . Look , I told him the same thing , okay ? But he 's his own man . Just ... Just give him a minute . Yeah , yeah , give me a minute . I 'm my own man , thanks , Bill . So , Anna 's a good liar , not like me . But ... But I still caught her because she said " is " instead of " was . " Stanton Parish isn 't a dead writer . He 's alive . Bill , please . Doc . So I did another search , but not by name , by face , and that 's the creepy part Bill was talking about . There , he was a scientist in Russia for their MK Ultra program . Same face , same man . So , Stanton Parish was a double agent . No , no , no , Dr. Rosen . It 's a puzzle , you have to look at all the pieces . It 's a metaphor . Just ... Okay , okay . Same face , Stanton Parish . Stanton Parish . Stanton Parish . Wait , this is from the Civil War . Yeah , it 's old . He was about 40 years old , right ? Same guy , a hundred years later when he worked for MK Ultra . He 's an Alpha who doesn 't age ? And Anna says that he 's dangerous . She 's scared of him and Anna 's not scared of anyone . And there 's this , he wrote this . The manifesto . Bill says it 's the Red Flag playbook . Wait a minute , an Alpha this powerful and we knew nothing about him ? That 's why they were trying to erase our files . To keep Parish hidden . Meet the new boss , same as the old boss . I got it . The rubies , I figured it out . These may seem like junk , but this is Iaboratory-grown silicon . More densely organized than anything I have ever seen . It is the perfect storage medium . So I decided to play around . And then in this , inside the pendant , I discovered this . It 's a jump drive . Voilà . Gary , can you ... Oh , yeah , yeah , yeah , I 'll do it . There . Wait a minute , that 's encoded data , right ? Gary , isn 't that Anna 's language ? Yeah , that 's what Anna does . She sends messages . Like the DOT numbers on the truck they blew up , the order to assassinate Dr. Rosen ... No , no , she regrets that . She said that that 's regrettable . We 'll argue about that later , okay ? Can you translate this ? Yeah . All right , those are GPS coordinates . Yeah , it leads to Highland Mills . That 's not far from here . Sixty miles . It 's a map , directions . No , no , it 's ... It 's an invitation . See right here ? There 's a time . 7 : 00 a.m. Like Sullivan said , tomorrow morning . All right , so if that 's a time and date for a meeting , what 's that underneath ? That part 's sneaky . It 's even sneakier than Anna 's code . So , what 'd I steal ? Oh , okay , no , no , no . I 've got it . It 's a quote here at the bottom . It 's from the book , A Call for Change . It 's more than a quote , Gary . It 's a signature from the leader of Red Flag , Stanton Parish . He 's called this meeting . We confirmed the intel that you gave us . Nice work on that . The target , an old abandoned brick factory . We 're bringing in tactical teams , special equipment , everything we can throw at them . You 're positive this supposed leader of theirs is going to be there ? Well , he called the meeting . I suppose he 'll be there . Then Anna 's going to be there , too . And you can 't hurt her . She ... She 's my friend and she can 't protect herself . Our first move will be tear gas and non-Iethal weapons . But let me be clear , these terrorists will be neutralized . Yes , Senator ? Gary , maybe you should go home . No , I 'm not going home . Anna 's going to be there and I 'm going be there . I 'm part of the team . Okay , I 'll join in with tactical and do what I can . And I 'll protect Anna if it 's possible . - Yeah . Doc , you 'll stay outside and coordinate with Rachel and Gary . I 'm going to go in with Hicks and Nina . Bill , you can go in , but only as an agent . It 's too early to put that kind of stress on your heart . This is Red Flag versus us . This is endgame . I 'm in . Here you go , Doc . It 's time . Hey . These guys you 're going after , is it their fault that Will 's dead ? Yes , I believe it is . Then I hope you get all of them . Rosy future . Something someone once said that I wanted . And he wasn 't wrong . What would that even look like ? Dani , you were right , um , about the tea . I knew about your ability and I used it . I used you to try to save a marriage that I had already ruined . I ... I don 't know what you expect me to say , Dad . I don 't expect you to say anything . You don 't have to . I just wanted you to hear it . No , I 'm not coming home tonight , Mom . I ... I can 't tell you , but my friends need my help . All of my friends . Yeah , I love you too , Mom . Mom , please don 't cry . Listen , Bill 's going to protect me . Come on . He 's my partner . He 's ... He 's very strong and one time he pushed me over , which was better than taking a bullet . I said don 't cry . Come on , time to saddle up , Iet 's go . Anna 's here , two bodyguards . That makes over 30 Red Flag Alphas inside . Gary says that 's the last car heading this way , as far as he can tell . Dr ... Dr. Rosen . Dr. Rosen , you should let me go and talk to ... You should let me go and talk to Anna , because I could get them to surrender . I always get people to do what I want to do . Gary . Shh . Because I wear them down . Yeah , you do that , Gary . Gary , this is a very dangerous situation . If you want to be here , you have to do exactly as you 're told . Yeah . You look like you belong here . Once a Marine ... I thought you hated the Marines . It 's kind of a love-hate . Look , if anything happens to me ... Don 't say it . It 's bad luck . Still no sign of Parish ? Nothing . He never showed and neither have about another dozen Red Flag leaders . From what I can hear inside they are not happy about it . He calls the meeting and he doesn 't show ? That doesn 't make sense , he should ... It 's starting . What are they saying ? Hiding like this is gonna make things worse . You don 't get to decide . - Let her talk . They 're talking about going public . Going public ? Tell the world the truth about Alphas . Remember , stick with your teams . Watch you fields of fire and give the gas time to work . Agent Sullivan ? No one advances until I give the say so . Agent Sullivan , Kathy . Wait , wait , we can 't do this . Put some socks on , Lee , your feet are getting cold . No , will you bear with me just for a moment ? Listen , the day before this meeting was supposed to happen , a Red Flag assassin leads us right to my daughter . Who is carrying an invitation which my team decodes just in time for us to be here . Now what does that sound like to you ? A set-up . So you think we 're walking into an ambush . No , I think we are the ambush . Stanton Parish gathered these people here , he tips us off to their location just so that we 'll do exactly what we 're doing . Why would Stanton Parish betray Red Flag ? According to you , it 's his organization . Because Rachel has heard the people inside talking . They 're talking about coming out of the dark , revealing their secrets . Going public ? Yes . Well , then it 's a good thing we 're here , Lee . No , Kathy ... And I am betting that 's exactly what Stanton Parish wants you to feel . You 're playing right into his hands . You 're betting , you are betting , you think . A week ago you didn 't even know that Stanton Parish existed . And now apparently you 're in his head . I don 't have time for your theories , Lee . Do the people in that building belong to a terrorist organization ? It 's not that simple . Really ? Because I think it 's a yes or no question . Are they Red Flag or not ? All right , I 'm not saying that they 're all innocent ... Well , good , then you haven 't lost your mind altogether . Go ! All right , here we go now . Oh , Rachel . This is a mistake . This is a big mistake . Oh . Team one in position . Team two on the move . Wearing a mask you can 't push anyone . You should be hanging back . I 'll be okay . Team two in position . Ready on your go , command . Release the gas . We are federal agents . Surrender and no one will get hurt . No , no , no ! No , Dr. Rosen ... Gary ! Gary , no ! Gary ! Rachel , stay here . Stay here . Gary ! On the ground , now ! Keep moving ! Anna ! You 're like me . Better . Gary ! Gary ! Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Ow ! No , no ! Gary ! Gary ! Sleep . Gary ! Wait , Gary ! Get out of the way ! Man down ! Man down ! Permission to open fire ! Copy that . Return fire is authorized . Return fire is authorized . Fire at will ! Ah ! Anna ! Anna ! Anna ! Anna ! Ah ! Ah ! Anna ! Anna ! Anna , Anna , it 's okay . Anna ? Come on , I 'll help carry you . Anna , come on . Anna . Anna . Anna , come on . Anna ... Get up , come on ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! He 's one of us ! He 's one of us . Anna , Anna ... My God . Oh , my God . Anna ! People died . Anna died . But she shouldn 't be dead . If ... If I had a gas mask I probably could 've saved her . Gary , you don 't know that . Yeah , well , you don 't know either . Nobody knows . And Dr. Rosen , he doesn 't know . See , he pretends to know everything , but he doesn 't . I don 't know if I can keep doing this . I don 't think I 'm the only one who feels that way . No , she 's not . We don 't know what we 're doing . I 'm not sure if we ever did . And right now there is no " this . " No , Cameron , you 're wrong . This is a team . And that hasn 't changed . What you 've done , you 've done for the right reasons . Under circumstances that sometimes were beyond even our control . You followed your instincts , you followed your hearts . You have nothing to be ashamed of . We have to stand on that . What about the fact that every time we ... Lee ? I 'm sorry , excuse me . I need to talk to you for a minute . Yeah . Is this where you explain all about clouds and silver linings ? Not me . Hey . This is still a win , Lee . A win for who ? Us or Stanton Parish ? If Parish exists , we 'll get him . So you have whatever resources you need . Money , equipment , it 's yours . You want another Alpha on your team ? Pick one . Pick five . How would your daughter like a job ? Can we please not talk about my daughter ? Fair enough . Look , I know you 're not able to see it right now , but the raid on Highland Mills was a success . It crippled Red Flag . We caught terrorists , we stopped this Alpha situation from being blown wide open . And that is a huge victory for you and your team . I know . Thank you . And if you want proof , the powers that be would like your input on how to move forward . Closed-door session in D.C. , week from today . They look forward to your thoughts . They 're calling it a success , this raid . But I 'm not so sure , which is par for the course these days . You know when I was little I ... I thought you knew more about everything than anyone else in the world . And it 's now I see that you don 't know all the answers to the questions . And sometimes you don 't even know the questions . I guess that 's part of growing up . Realizing that your parents have feet of clay . Yeah , well , to tell you the truth , I like you better this way . Dani , what you 've been through , what I 've put you through , must have been incredible painful . You can 't even imagine , Dad . No , I can 't . I tend to intellectualize everything . I approach everything from an analytical standpoint , but you 're not my patient , you 're my daughter . I never really understood emotionally what it felt to be you . So , Danielle , I want you to do your thing . I don 't think that 's a good idea . I want to know . I ... God , I don 't know what to say . Then it worked . Dr. Rosen ? I 'm Stanton Parish . Your daughter 's fine . Nothing to worry about . I came alone . So , tell me , Doctor , how does it feel to be living your dreams ? You 've always wanted to be on the cutting edge , to make your mark in history . You 've achieved that . By helping you purge Red Flag of everyone not in lock step with your plans ? You 're upset about that . Now be honest , secrecy serves us all . You want to protect your team , government wouldn 't know what to do if this went public and for now , I operate best in the dark . Obviously not everyone in Red Flag agrees with you . Mmm , troublemakers . You and I , we put an end to them . That coldness , that complete lack of empathy . It 's just what I expected your downside to be . So what else ? You don 't age , you probably don 't even get sick , I doubt you even sleep . Hmm , think beyond Alpha . I have complete control of my mind . Perfect brain-body connection . At the cost of your humanity . I am humanity , what humanity will become . The future belongs to people like me and certainly we can agree on that . You can stop trying to manipulate me into feeling that we share an agenda , some kind of connection . I 'm every bit as good at that as you . Oh , but we do have a connection . What , that we both use people ? But for completely different ends . No , we don 't share a damn thing . You advocate bloodshed and war . War . It 's inevitable . In two years , maybe three . Nothing that you or I can do to stop that . You 'll forgive me if I try . You 're wasting your talents , Lee . You 're so close to understanding it all . The answers to the questions you 've been asking ever since you realized that your daughter was different . The biology of Alphas . The great mystery of the human brain . I can get you there . And in return ? I 've got so many plans on the verge of fruition . You can help with that . People died because of your plans . I 've helped you enough . Think about it . You 'll come around . When I first discovered the Alpha phenomenon I was a doctor treating a group of remarkable patients . Since then , events have unfolded in ways that no one could have predicted , starting with the emergence of Red Flag . Here , straight from Klauswerks . Thanks , Gary . Hey , and don 't forget to shave , all right ? It is Congress after all . Oh , Rachel ! Red Flag is a radical Alpha organization , which is willing to do anything , even commit murder , to advance its cause . Cameron , Dani 's at my house , will you look in on her from time to time ? Yeah , I 'll keep her safe . Now the government 's response to their actions has been understandably swift and aggressive . Good luck . Come here . Gathering intelligence , deploying tactical units , even using my own covert team of Alphas . But despite all efforts , the situation has become increasingly unstable . Culminating with the incident at Highland Mills . Those responsible for the group 's violent ideology are still out there . Indeed their founder and leader , Stanton Parish , is still at large . I understand your concern , Dr. Rosen , and we 're willing to provide you with as many tactical teams as you need . I believe that , uh , Binghamton is nowhere near capacity . Am I right ? Yes , Binghamton . I was coming to that . A clandestine prison hospital where Alphas are confined and subjected to experiments without any respect paid to their civil rights or their humanity . Binghamton is not the answer . Binghamton is part of the problem . Red Flag and the government 's Alpha program are two sides of the same coin . They both rely all too frequently on violence and secrecy . Abuses that can only thrive in the dark . Son of a bitch is actually going through with this . Thank you , Dr. Rosen . That 's very interesting . Thank you for your time . Which is precisely what their leader , Stanton Parish , wants , darkness . And by our keeping the Alpha phenomenon secret , we are only following a path , his path , which I believe can only lead to a war . So , what I am advocating , Senator , is not more money , or more guns , or even a bigger prison . I am calling for light . For transparency . An end to secrets . So I say to all of you here and to all of you watching , Alphas exist . They are among us . They are our friends and our spouses . They are our sons and daughters . Our neighbors , our co-workers . This just got complicated . What the ... Order ! Order ! This is what we have been hiding . Order ! Turn his microphone off . I don 't want this on the record ! This is what we have been hiding . He 's broadcasting all over the ... I warned you . Yes . Yes , you did . Sharing this truth may make things messier , more complicated . But it will hold both sides accountable for their actions . And it will also prevent this war that Stanton Parish ... Security ! ... so badly wants . Get that man out of here ! By sharing this truth , it will become evident that it 's time for everyone to open their eyes , to open their minds and to open their ...

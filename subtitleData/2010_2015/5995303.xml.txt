 Hurry up ! Come on . Don 't trip . Hey , watch where you 're going ! Hey , do you have a moment ? You came to this map yesterday as well , right ? Your " Personality " looks plain but has great information density . You 've got quite a bit of memory . Do I look like that ? Don 't tell me ! You 're an upper class citizen ? Even if you don 't come to open maps like this , you can still rent a private location . Actually , I 've combined my memory with my friend , and we 're sharing a private map . It 's quieter and has higher resolution . Sorry , but I want to enjoy my vacation by myself . You 're not very straightforward , huh ? You created such a fancy " Personality " just to show off to other people ? Only to enjoy content this cheap ? It 's like wasting a treasure . It has something to do with my job . Job ? Eh ? What ? What 's happening ? Huh ? To the humans living in Deva , please listen quietly for a moment . I am Frontier Setter . In order to bring you to a new possibility , I 've entered this virtual reality . Man , again ? Rumors say that this is coming from Earth . I have prepared for many years to explore the galactic system . Going to an unknown world . What ? That 's scary . What is security doing ? Man , that 's why i don 't like open maps ! Agent code ZQ875456 , Angela Balzac . From the security authority , requesting to interface with the current system . Authorized . Transferring system administration to Angela Balzac . Command standby . You ! Next is giving up your current environment , using computer space ew living environment . List all the current connected users . Compare them with Deva IDs . From 1842 users , there are seven users with repeated IDs . Issuing warning . Cancel the warning . Let them go for now . Reorganize with connection speed . Please look . This is the product of a lost technology , Genesis Ark . This new world exploration ship had about a hundred scientists developing it . It 's this guy . Using the emergency line in the open , you think I wouldn 't notice ? Trace access route . Therefore , a safer and more suitable application became a possibility . Citizens of Deva who gave up their bodies are best suited to challenge the new world . Although what lies ahead of us is unknown , I am looking forward to the data the journey will bring . The journey will begin soon . Even if it 's only one person , I would like to find more people who are willing to journey the galaxy with me . I am Frontier Setter . I will wait for everyone 's reply . No use using dummies now ! It 's this one ! The same trick ! Gotcha ! Here I go . Hey , watch it ! Damn it ! Central Security calling 3rd class Agent , Angela Balzac . Please go immediately . Central Security calling 3rd class Agent , Angela Balzac . Please go immediately . Well , as you see , I am one of Deva 's security personnel . If you want my contacts , why don 't you ask ? No , umm ! Maybe next time ! Excellent performance earlier . I apologize for letting him get away . That hacker called Frontier Setter cracked in , this is already the 184th time . They 're all connected to Deva 's data line from a ground facility . We 've concluded that the culprits are Earthlings who refuse to enter Deva . His potential is beyond our defense system . Is there even anything outside of Deva ? We have to admit this is beyond our expectations . It is unlikely that the situation will be resolved even if we strengthen our securities . Therefore , the mission of tracking Frontier Setter must be transferred to the real world . Real world ! 3rd class Agent , Angela Balzac , I want you to participate in this mission . It is my honor . 3rd class Agent , Angela Balzac . The most suitable material body will form from your DNA . Thirty-five hours until the completion of the body . Too slow . Warning ! Material body will be the Earth equivalent of a 16 year old . It is not fully grown . That 's fine . Affirmative . Don 't need to break-in . A virtual one is more than enough . It 's a bit stiff . So , what 's the equipment this time ? One fully equipped exo-suit Arhan . And a local Agent as companion . Zarik Kajiwara , nickname Dingo . Completed 18 missions from Central Security . Overall Ranking : S. But has a terrible reputation . Hopefully he 'll be useful . What is this dusty atmosphere ? I need to breathe this kind of thing ? Kind of disappointing . I thought the real world would be more exciting . Control , this is Angela Balzac . Arrived on ground . All green . Where 's the local navigator ? I don 't see him . Current location is the rendezvous point . Would you like to track with satellite ? Please do . Agent Dingo , confirmed . This guy ? And what 's all the stuff behind him ? Mutated Arthropods , Myriapoda , known as " Sand Worms " . Carnivorous creatures . Danger Level : B + . What is he doing ? I give up . Got into trouble already ？ System standby . Deva tactical operation . Online set up . Okay , let 's go ! This is perfect for my warmup . Is he stupid ? Jeez . I don 't need to waste ammo on such low level creatures ! Wait ! What ? Head ? Alright ! Calculating aim , capturing motion , adjusting trajectory . Setup ! Automatic Smart Fire ! Ready . I 'm not gonna miss a single shot ! Not bad . Not bad , thanks for taking care of all of them . An observer weighing me down on the first day , what were you thinking ? Don 't be so harsh . I still need to help you from now on . Think of it as helping each other . Anyway , what are those ? Throw the luggage away if you 're running away . Are you stupid ? No , I wasn 't running away . I dragged those cans on purpose . Huh ？ Sand Worms are attracted to metallic noises , if you bang on empty containers , they 'll come chase after you . It 's easy . Woah , what a load ! Wow , such load All right everyone . Here 's the big sale as promised . All you can take for only three hundred Narokarads ! Carry until you can 't carry anymore ! Here ! Alright ! Thank you ! This is great ! Please come again . Hey . Ahh , thanks a lot . You helped even though I didn 't ask you . I welcome generous bosses . We 're gonna be great partners . All the meat . About the reward . Ah , underground resources from satellite scan as usual . Hope I can hit the jackpot again . Payment with cash would be much better but ! to the people of Deva , cash is ! This is for after the mission . I 'll pay you depending on your performance . Hey hey , aren 't you supposed to give an initial payment to gain my trust ? How can I trust you when you sabotaged me like that ? It 's not sabotage . I had a feeling you would take care of all the Sand Worms . You ! You 've already wasted seven minutes and twenty seconds of my precious time ! Time is precious . This is plain sabotage ! Why are you in such a hurry ? Anyway , the mission starts tomorrow , right ? The other agents are still not down here . That 's right ! That 's why this is the perfect time to get ahead of everyone else ! This is why I stopped the growing of the body early . So that 's why you look like a teen . I thought you had some kind of fetish ! Listen up , if someone finds Frontier Setter before me , then you will NOT be paid . If you understand , then work harder . Still want to fight for rewards at this kind of moment ? Did you even read the mission debrief ? Deva has been hacked constantly these days . And the culprit is somewhere on Earth , right ? This is strange . As you see , people who stayed on Earth have to kill creatures and eat their flesh to survive . But instead we have to find the person who won a cyber battle against you ? You sure it 's not some kind of alien or something ? Whatever it is , there 's no doubt it 's connecting from Earth . My mission is to find the source of the hack . Your mission is to assist me . Understood ? I know . I will . By the way , that is really impressive . What is the concept of that rapid fire ? The main server from Central Security is backing me up via a satellite connection . Calculating trajectories is its specialty . It can even hit moving targets . Traveling at the speed of light . That 's impressive . So as a terminal to Deva , it is always connected to it . That 's really reliable . Even a hundred enemies won 't be a problem . Huh , you understood quickly despite living in the Stone Ages . You said satellite connection , right ? Where 's the antenna ? The center of the rear . Don 't touch it . Wait ! What are you doing ? ! What are you doing ? You dumbass ! No , you 're the dumbass . The enemy is a hacker even Deva can 't defeat , right ? So why are you bringing a connected terminal that the hacker can access ? What are you thinking ? Are you trying to constantly give your location away to the hacker ? Even so , you didn 't need to destroy it ! You can 't access Deva . No matter what . Think of it this way , if you use satellite connections , then you 're exposing your position to your enemy . How are we supposed to complete the mission ? If the rest of the agents are like you , they won 't care and will connect to Deva anyway . and the enemy will know everything . Anyway , the other agents will be bait . So you and I will have to hide ourselves , sneak behind the enemy , using our eyes , nose , ears and feet , maybe then can we be ahead of Frontier Setter . Are you confident ? Maybe . But wisdom , patience , and stamina are my strong points . Only God knows how it 'll end now . All right then , this thing . Does it still work when it 's offline ? No , it 's a piece of junk now ! Oh , a piece of junk . Even junk has their uses . Whoa , high class parts as always ! Please come again ! Arhan , my Arhan ! My A + support ! What 's gonna happen next ! ? Don 't look so depressed . The money from the piece of junk will be put to good use , I promise . That 's not the problem ! So , where are you driving to ? Map ? We 'll find our first clue at the town of Jedoes . It 's about 1000km south of here . Huh ? Why a place that far ? This isn 't an easy opponent to find , right ? If we want information , we need to go into town . And why do we need to go to a town that far away ? There are lots of places where people gather , right ? Like I said , the other agents are gonna be the bait . You know their search area and landing area , right ? Yea . If that 's shared on the network , then Mr. Frontier Setter will see it as well , right ? Then he 'll be careful not to leave any clues in that area . Because it is a high risk area . So we 'll work around those areas . First search through towns that Central Security hasn 't reached yet . Well , just wait and see . The first one to panic is the first one to lose . No matter if they 're the hunter or the hunted . What 's wrong ? We 'll camp here tonight . Huh ? Wait . Like I said , we can 't waste a single second . Waste ! ? How can you not sleep ? You can go to sleep . I 'll drive when you 're sleeping . You don 't need any sleep ? I didn 't do anything particularly exhausting . This car is a manual , can you drive it ? Don 't underestimate me . This ancient technology is too simple . Just tell me the direction . Do you want one ? It 's Sand Worm meat . No thanks . Does that taste good ? It doesn 't have any taste . Huh ? You ! just got out of Deva . Eat and drink more , don 't you want to enjoy life ? If it 's entertainment , I 've always had plenty in cyberspace . Entertainment in an actual body is nothing compared to it . Uhh ! I don 't mean those things ! You don 't need a satisfaction of a full stomach ? I don 't think I need it . We 've already outgrown our need for satisfaction . Satisfaction , huh ? That 's what you feel when you have a full stomach , right ? That 's just a limitation of a body . We don 't need metabolism for that kind of thing . So our mind can concentrate on higher entertainment . Your body is not robotic , right ? Yea , this is a clone body copied from my DNA . If I don 't have the nerves of this body , my mind can 't get used to it . So you had a body before ? Only for 1300 hours after fertilization . Did you think Deva citizens are in binary when they 're born ? I 'm relieved that they 're not . But , don 't push yourself too far in a body you 're not used to . I 'll change with you if you 're tired . What 's wrong ? Here comes the other Agents . Everyone arrived a bit early , huh ? They knew I was ahead of them , so they all came down . Busy working for Deva huh . How many tears have I shed How much pain have I felt Poem without language Resonance hidden within our souls What is this noisy music ? ALISE . You don 't have any Old Rock in Deva ? Nobody listens to this . Place with no sense huh . Isn 't Deva archiving the history of humanity ? How come there 's no Rock ? Maybe it wasn 't worth keeping . Well , of course . What 's so good about this noise ? That 's because you only listen to your ears . Listen to it with your soul . Reason to march forward I 'm always searching from thereafter If you want to rest , you can use the bed in the back . No need . You sure ? You look sleepy . There 's no such thing . If I don 't supervise you , who knows what you 'll do . Okay . Okay . Oh , I can see it , it 's Jedoes . That 's ! How are we gonna get information ? Miss , you want some ? I 'll sell it to you with a discount . I 'm finding a man who 's doing business with Frontier Setter . You have a clue ? Is Isark at the Yorugun market ! ? Wait up ! Sorry you 're gonna have to ask Urobuchi Kappa Hey ! Translate it for me ! Wai ! What is this ! What is this ! What is this ! UGH ! What is this ! What is this ! Can 't even do translation or information gathering ! Why does the world outside of Deva still exist ? Hey little girl . Are you lost ? We can take you around . But it comes with a high fee . Ha ? Good timing . I 'm frustrated . You little ! You troublesome brat . My body ! Feels heavy ! Damn it ! Damn . Shit . I 'll remember this ! Don 't underestimate the real world . Shut up . Sorry , I should have noticed . Leave me be . I ! Over-stressed . Seems like you caught a cold while you were weak . Cold ? You have a really bad fever . Yet you 're still running around and the cold got worse . Pushing yourself to the limit . The cold got worse ? Bodies are really inconvenient ! You didn 't realize you have a cold ? The Operator will monitor my nerves . A warning will be sent if there 's something wrong . But the connection is cut ! Warning ! ? You should feel pain yourself . Pain ! I thought that 's normal for a flesh body ! I see . This is your first time feeling tired and sick . I looked through your survival kit . I didn 't find any medicine . Did you not prepare it ? The center is a medical server . It 'll give me the best medicine depending on my body condition . But you 'll need to connect to diagnose . Maybe it 's time to connect to the network ! Wait , what are you doing ? I thought connecting is forbidden . But if you can 't connect to Deva then you can 't heal , right ? How are you supposed to complete the mission in this condition ? What do people on Earth do when they get sick ? If it 's just a cold , eat something healthy , keep yourself warm and sleep . If it 's more severe , it 's up to fate if you can find a doctor and medicine . Then I 'll do the same . I 'm not going to need any backup for this mission . Why do you have to do it to this extent ? That 's not the problem . I 've never admitted defeat or given up . That 's why I got promoted to 3rd class Agent in Central Security . Don 't underestimate me . I 'll prove it to you . I can get more accomplishments . I see . You have guts . You 're not only just 3rd class level . There 'll be more chances for a promotion . Of course . You 're well enough to move now ? Only for a bit . Hey , you said it before . Listen to the music with your soul . Is that such an amazing thing ? Speaking of amazing , isn 't what you 've experienced in Deva greater than what I 've experienced ? Yeah ! Computerized " Personalities " can extend their senses according to their memory . I 've heard the sound of a gamma ray explosion from ten billion light years away before . Felt fundamental particles between my fingertips . But , listening with your soul ! This is the first time I 've heard of it . You weren 't afraid of me . That surprised me . Why should I fear you ? Central Security is my oldest customer . I 've completed multiple missions . I know you guys aren 't ghosts or monsters . Then you should understand , computerized humans are the next stage of evolution . People on Earth are bound to become extinct . Hunger , stress , and sickness restrict the body . How can you treat me normally ? When you 're in the minority . Where do you get this confidence ? Is it the value you 've found in your flesh body ? Or is it because you can listen with your soul ? The night wind is bad for your body . Go back to sleep . The goal of Frontier Setter ? Yeah . If we get this goal wrong , the purpose of the search will drift away . I said he 's trying to cause chaos in Deva . Induce a panic among the citizens of cyberspace . And after that ? One day , he 'll commence mass destruction . To do that , panic is needed . There 's no doubt that this is the worst possible outcome , but that may not be his true goal . The ones who 're panicking are the officials of Central Security . The unbreachable security got breached . They panicked from the breach and was unable to see his true purpose . Instead of how he did it , why he did it is more important . If I knew , then I wouldn 't be working so hard . That guy already talked to a lot of people , right ? Finding members for galaxy exploration . You must be mad to believe such a thing . And your evidence is ? First of all , there 's no point . Because of Deva , problems with population overgrowth and resources have been solved . What 's the use of galaxy exploration now ? The risk and reward is not balanced . That only applies to people in Deva , right ? People living outside think more . You saw it too . Should I believe in what Frontier Setter said ? He said the exploration ship is prepared . Don 't be stupid . How is such a big project undetected by Deva ? All the galaxy exploration plans before Nano Hazard have been terminated . This is solid history . Deva 's records are not reliable . They 'll delete any content deemed useless . Right ? Someone who can access the space ship from ground must also need a method to get out of the atmosphere . That means rockets . Hey , sorry for the wait . You 're the one that Isark told me ? You 're Lazlore ? Yeah . I think it 's some ancient fertilizer . I don 't know what he 's collecting these for but this is a good trade . Oh ~ It 's ammonium nitrate . It 'll decompose into nitrous oxide . It 's more stable than liquidized oxygen . It 's the perfect material for rocket fuel 's oxidant . How do you trade ? Barter . Once I collect a certain amount , I 'll take it to the old ruins in the North . Then I 'll get some good circuits or some machine parts . Sometimes there will be something better mixed in there . How long have you been trading like this ? Has it been quite a while ? It 's not only quite a while . My grandfather started collecting these . This is a family business from a long time ago . By the way , why do you know about rockets ? I did research . There 's still books on Earth . If you want to use hybrid rockets , fuel is easy to get . You still need ABS , acrylic-based resin and synthetic rubber . You should able to find lots of them in the ruins . But oxidant is a different thing . You can only buy the ingredients on the market . Speaking of this strange chemical , there hasn 't been anyone who 's selling it on the market . I give up . You really believe in that stuff . It 's only a possibility , but it is still worth searching for . It 's not like we have other clues . Well , yeah ! For three generations , they have been collecting ammonium nitrate . That 's extremely strange . If they 're a ammunition factory then that 's fine . But then , how come ammunition is not a common item on the market ? That means he 's storing the chemicals . You think it 's Frontier Setter ? Whoever he is , there 's someone who wants to use a hybrid rocket to go into space . Maybe they 're not alone . Maybe they 're an organization . They 've collected large amounts of resources according to their plan . They prepared for this long , which means the plan was from a long time ago . Even before Deva was formed . Maybe even from before the Nano Hazard . If their intent was to execute their plan secretly , it 's not surprising that Deva didn 't even detect them . Wasting that much time and resources , it 's weird no matter how you think about it . That 's not normal . Don 't you know that tale of a man who built a castle from stones on the road ? Hey , I want to ask my trusty Field Observer something . Is it just me , or are our tasks reversed ? You were the one who said to scout from a vantage point . That 's the most efficient way . Unfortunately , I have acrophobia . Don 't blame me . You useless ! Is this okay ? Perfect . I can see very well . Dingo , are you looking at your eight o 'clock ? Wow , that 's a sentry robot from before Nano Hazard . There 's still a functional unit ? Automatic ? No , not something that fancy . It 's remote controlled . Somebody is controlling it . And that 's Frontier Setter . Maybe . Mr. Lazlore is here too . Let 's wait and see . There 's other robots ? Yeah , that 's impressive . It 's not only antiques . New robots made from separate parts . He really preserved the old technology . You have any clue who can do this ? Nope . If you can restore that many robots , you could be crowned king . But he hid his identity and is planning something in the dark . This is very suspicious . Like Lazlore said . Nobody came out . Only robots are doing the trade . Why ? Who knows ? Maybe he 's shy . What 's that ? I think it 's an entrance to a subway system . All the subway tunnels from before are still here . He 's using that to move ? Yeah , now we 're getting lucky . All right . Yes . Hopefully this old trick works . Go faster ! The signal is dropping ! Even if you ask me ! I don 't think he noticed yet . This means that no human beings are checking the case . I think this is all robotic transportation . That 's impressive but he wasn 't careful enough . Only using remote controlled robots , this eliminates human participation in transport . It 's like a miracle by the looks of the technology now . If he can do this , maybe he can do something crazier . How about ! Hacking into Deva with no traces left behind ? Then how did this ancient trade method work ? I think they only cared about satellite connections . What do you think about that ? That 's not just a plain robot . Time for some brainstorming . The transmitter 's signal cut off from there . I don 't think you can continue the story without going pass it . Is it gonna attack ? Then it should have other methods such as ambush . That 's not threatening at all . Even if it 's just a guard , it doesn 't make sense for it to stand there . Something 's wrong . What do you mean ? Maybe it 's for greeting people . Anyway , the fastest way is to check it out . Welcome ! I have no means of attacking . Please disarm yourself . Well ! Should we trust it ? Who knows ? We 'll decide after some talking . We 're here for Frontier Setter . Is he here ? I 'll communicate on his behalf . I don 't want to talk to a robot , but the real thing himself . How 's that ? It is very unfortunate , I do not have a body . You can only identify me via this sound interface . Are you a computerized " Personality " ? No , I can only be defined as " I " . Tell me more . Like your name or where you were born ? What I was previously was the progress manager application from Genesis Ark , their optimizer program . 16278 days after operation . From the 2259341st self update diagnosis . The concept of " ego "  appeared . That 's from 42659 days and 11 hours ago . An AI developed an ego ? I am in command of Operation : Genesis Ark at the moment . The only participant is me . I wish to have mutual understanding with you . Uhh ! um ! I 'm Dingo , nice to meet you . Greetings Dingo . I am Frontier Setter . Pleased to meet you . I can 't see anything . It is hidden with optical camouflage at the moment . Switching to infrared . That 's huge ! Exploration ship , Genesis Ark , is around 1200m in length . Using automatic clusters in Lagrange III , it is constructed automatically . So that 's why . Deva 's position in on the other side of Lagrange I. Lagrange III is on the other side of the Sun and Lagrange I is between the Sun and Earth . No wonder you can 't see it . When did you build it ? Originally , Operation : Frontier Setter was prepared for change on Earth , to find living environments in the galaxy . At the time , to ensure the survivability of humanity , multiple countries commenced the operation separately . Because of the rivalry , the current operation is undercover . See ? Deva doesn 't know everything . Then , why did you hack into Deva ? Because the ship was built in a hurry , I 've removed life support from the ship . But , storage on the server for computerized " Personalities " is available . Genesis Ark 's original goal is to send humanity to explore the outer galaxy . Right now , I can 't launch the ship . And I can 't fulfill my purpose . Then why didn 't you negotiate with Deva in the first place ? From Deva 's political concept , I 've concluded that they believe outer space exploration has little value . Therefore , instead of negotiating with the officials , I spoke to the citizens directly . That 's why I dived into VR . Deva thought what you did was an attack . I understand . Unfortunately , I do not have other methods to approach citizens of Deva . My purpose is to send a message . I have no intention of breaking the law and order . This facility was built to launch missiles to other countries . It was discarded as civilization collapsed . Therefore , I took over . What are you launching to the ship ? Construction on the satellite in orbit does not contain the power system . The reactor and mainframe 's primary power unit are completed here and launched into space in order to complete Genesis Ark . Why did you make it so complicated ? At first , due to the competition from others , it was impossible to provide protection to Lagrange III . In the worst case scenario , when the ship is under enemy fire , we had plans of reactors that could be used as weapons due to security concerns . After the threat disappeared , from the orbit , which is out of the supply line , we can only use limited resources to complete the ship . The reactor has to be made on Earth . So you did this thing for forty thousand days ! That means you 've been doing this for a hundred years . This is my proof of existence . What are you gonna do after you launch the ship ? I 'll put my mainframe with the reactor on the HLV . After docking to Genesis Ark , I 'll be the background control program . That means you 're leaving Earth . So , what do you think Deva 's Central Security is going to do about this ? I don 't know , I 'll just report what I saw , then it 's all up to them . So our mission is done for now ? But then the problem is the way to get back . Although it 's easy to send my " Personal Data " back using the Arhan , thanks to someone , it 's no longer usable . Why don 't you send a distress signal then ? What are you thinking ? Who 's fault was it for me to embarrass myself ! I 'll prepare the connection . I believe it 's fine with a Deva citizen with an official access code . Well , that 's right ! But the equipment is not compatible with Deva 's terminal , right ? I will have to reroute it . I will help with the modification . This song is ALISE 's EONIAN , right ? I haven 't heard a human sing for a hundred fifty years . You know music ? This was the favorite song of my previous users . They hummed this song while designing Genesis Ark . I like this song too . I 'm glad , it 's not common to talk about old songs . Hey , what does " love " feel like to you ? It 's noise that gives my circuits pressure and at the same time increases processing power . I defined it like that . To understand this mysterious sensation , I thought for a long time . In conclusion , this is one of the clues to my ego . Interesting . I don 't feel like I 'm talking to a robot . Same here . You 're the first human I 've talked to after I 've obtained my " ego " The over-processing power right now could be defined as " Interesting " . This is ! I wanted to make what the song was missing previously . Although I didn 't make this on purpose . You 're pretty good . I brought my guitar . Let 's have an ensemble , ensemble . This is great . Man , you 're good ! Not really . Very good music ! Hey Dingo . Come here . What do you think about that AI ? What do you mean ? Is it just copying humans or ! Whatever , either way is fine . If you doubt that , then I can 't distinguish whether you 're human or a program . Right ! How are you going to report to your boss ? An AI that can make Deva 's communication barrier useless is still operational . Although this is dangerous , that AI just wants to leave this planet . Yeah . If he can limit the illegal connections to Deva ! Anyway , it 's not like Deva 's rules applies to an AI that evolved itself . He doesn 't seem like a bad guy . If you tell him to stop , he 'll stop . That 's right . Although I 'm a little bit disappointed , if we can restrict the illegal accesses , our mission is a success . Isn 't it my mission ! No , this is our contribution . Dingo , you have contributed much . If you want , you can even get Deva citizenship . Deva must have sent you many invitations . Don 't get me wrong , I 'm not trying to convince you . You 're brilliant and stupid at the same time . You didn 't understand that you could have a better life . You 're right . But I 'm confused and interested as well . Why didn 't you go to Deva ? Why do you want to live in a flesh body ? You can still act normally with an AI that developed an ego . You don 't actually care whether you have a real body or not , right ? If I go to Deva , my mind can have unlimited potential , and can evolve freely . That 's what they say all the time . Yes . That 's a lie . Everyone 's memory is limited and only the officials can change the limit . Even if the possibility is limitless , the actual processing power is not . That 's ! Normal , right ? Because processing resources are limited . Depending on accomplishments and potentials , prioritizing memory to different " Personalities " ! That 's why you 're working so hard . Memory is everything when living on Deva . Fighting for accomplishments become your life . What about others who don 't have large memory ? Deva has hobos and lazy people too , right ? We won 't distribute memory to those without the desire to advance . In the worst case , their archive will be frozen , to give their space to more useful people . But what 's wrong with that ? One who has improved our society and proved their usefulness can gain more happiness . Isn 't this a fair policy ? Where do you think it 's wrong ? It 's not about right or wrong . I just can 't stand lies . Like " you 'll get more freedom in Deva " that kind of bullshit . Same on Earth . You 'll die of hunger if you don 't make money for food . Of course , that 's what people who gave up on life deserve . But , people who haven 't given up can still get sick or injured . You might think this is unfair . Life is about whether you 're lucky or not . But , it 's different when it comes to Deva . What you can do and get , all depends on your contribution to society . Always watching other people 's mood . If you 're disliked or not congratulated , then you can 't live the life you want . What kind of freedom is that ? You may be released from the chains of your flesh body , but you just got into a more complicated chain . A chain made by humans called " society " I don 't want to be judged by others . Living a life depending on others . I don 't want to become a slave to live in paradise . Okay , this should be good . What will happen to your body after you 've returned to Deva ? My material body will go into deep sleep after transferring my " Personality " . They 'll send telomerase code to deal with the body after the mission is complete . Then I 'll contact you . Sorry but , cremation or burial , it 's up to you . Every time 's like this . That 's why I don 't like parting with Deva 's agents . It 's the worst experience . If there 's additional missions , maybe I 'll return to this body . Don 't do anything before my signs of life has stopped . Okay , okay . Just to double check , you don 't mean any harm to Deva , right ? To ensure the crew and citizens aren 't kidnapped or something . Only volunteers can board the ship . Spreading my existence and finding someone with something in common with me , that is my goal . I 'll report everything to the Central Security . You can 't run or hide . If you want to recruit crew members , talk to the Deva officials . Thank you for understanding , Angela Balzac . See ya . Well , you did great . You 're like what they say . Good skills with a bad attitude . You 're one of a kind . You don 't want to partner with me anymore ? Nah , if there 's a next time , I 'll find you again . This is Agent code ZQ875456 , Angela Balzac . Requesting access to Deva from unofficial route . Agent code confirmed . 3rd class Agent , Angela Balzac 's " Personality " authenticated . Access granted . The above is Frontier Setter 's true identity and reason for illegal accesses . Shocking report . 3rd class Agent , Angela Balzac . Your risky and fast way of finding the truth is commendable . Thank you very much . But you haven 't complete the objective of the mission . An explanation is needed for returning early during the mission . Your mission was to find the source of the hack and prevent it from happening again . Isn 't that right ? As I said before ! Frontier Setter has acknowledged the harm of illegal access . And promised he 'll contact under formal procedures . What are you talking about ? A computer program on Earth has gone rogue . This could be the worst disaster yet . But then you left it and came back . This is a lack of responsibility . This could even be called an impeachment . Please wait ! Although he may not be human , he has the intelligence to communicate . I 've negotiated with him and ! Whatever it is , we cannot ignore a presence that can put Deva 's security at risk . He doesn 't even want to live among us . He 'll be living outside of the solar system ! How can you promise he won 't come back ? We can say the risk has multiplied . How is he going to evolve after this ? This means we will not be in control of him . We can 't coexist ? With the current Deva citizens , our current system memory cannot satisfy most " Personalities " . Frontier Setter gave them a hint of a new world . Don 't only consider the security risks ! Think more about the citizens . Making a decision right now ! It 's too irresponsible ! 3rd class Agent , Angela Balzac , your mission is to return to your material body , and destroy the rogue AI : Frontier Setter 's main processing core , then your mission will be complete . Do you accept ? No . I will report this chat log to the supervising division and wait for the Central Court to judge . Is that so . That 's very unfortunate , Angela . Due to security reasons , you have knowledge of top secret files . We conclude that you have the possibility of leaking information . From now on , your security authorization and all Deva citizenship will be taken and you 'll be compressed in an archive . You 'll be sentenced to life imprisonment . The sentence is now final . Performing with a human has had many surprising discoveries . I have never experienced such passion before . So you like to talk to humans , huh ? Hmm ! Maybe you should negotiate with Deva again . Is that so ? It 's very lonely in the galaxy . You 'll regret it if you go there , by yourself . I see . I haven 't thought about that . Although I have not installed any life support systems ! Dingo , it is still not too late to install life support systems on the Genesis Ark . If you want , would you like to explore the galaxy with me ? I think it 'll be fun . But sorry , I have acrophobia . I can 't stand living above ground . I see , then there 's nothing I can do . But ! What 's wrong ? Dingo , this area is dangerous , please take evasive action . Huh ? I have intercepted an emergency from Deva 's Central Security . All the agents on Earth , and low Earth orbit 's assault team , have been informed the coordinates of this facility . Ugh . 3rd class Agent , Angela Balzac has been imprisoned for treason . How come ? I think she tried to plead for you and pissed off her boss . I thought she knows better than this . There is no benefit for her to plead for me . That 's uhh ! Well , you can 't really explain it . I think she likes you a lot . When receiving an illogical favor from others , one should do the same to return the illogical favor . I want to imitate those human properties ! It 's not something that complicated . In one word , it 's called " Loyalty " Why ! ? I didn 't do anything wrong . Why ! ? Why did I end up like this ? I ... I ... Are you all right , Angela Balzac ? Frontier Setter ? Why are you here ? First , I apologize for my action of accessing Deva illegally . You 're here to save me ? From Dingo 's explanation , this action is performed because of " Loyalty " Sorry , I couldn 't convince my boss . They want to scrap you . I understand . Assault teams are already advancing towards the facility . Battle will start in about 1 hour . At the same time , we are preparing an emergency launch for the HLV . It will take about 62 minutes to fuel and prepare . There 's still a chance for me to escape . Oh ! I lost my citizenship , got sentenced to prison . I don 't think I 'll return to Deva . Then there 's only one choice for me . This is what you call " loyalty " as well ? Thank you Angela . I am glad . Now that 's I 've decided . First let 's get out of this tiny space . Can you access the low Earth orbit platform ? Leave it to me . What is this mess ? I am controlling the transmitter in Genesis Ark to send the last recruit message to all Deva citizens . At the same time , to act as deception . Central Security will also send out official announcements to counter our message . It 'll be up to the citizens to decide . If you can do something like this , you could have destroyed Deva easily . That decision is too hasty . Right now , over 98 % of the world 's population is living in Deva . I cannot attack Deva just to prove my existence . You could have became friends with humans . High speed access gate ? Yes , we 'll camouflage as packets to access the low Earth orbit platform . I can only go to that Material body after leaving Deva . Do not worry , we are taking good care of it offline . I 'll have to live on that dirty and barbaric real world ? That 's demoralizing . Now I know how Adam and Eve feel when they got expelled from paradise . If you wish , I can provide you other options . This is the hardware overview of this platform . Alright ! Ah , found it ! This is it . Fully equipped , newest model of Arhan , this should be able to fit all my " Personality " data . Also , let 's " borrow " all the support systems . Ground Assault force 's platform is being hacked ! Impossible ! Cut the lines ! Stop the auto pilot ! Control regained , but they 've taken all the pods ! Detected re-entry trajectory . ETA 38 minutes to landing . We can land before the launch . What about Agents on Earth ? They are still advancing . But you should arrive earlier than them . Those people are always one step behind me ! Assault from Central Security . Wha ? Not even a warning ? Damn ! They 're catching up ! Analyzing unknown drive and circuit . Please hold for seven seconds . Analyze complete . Commencing computer support . Wow , amazing reaction speed . I didn 't evolve for nothing . Old technology like me ! Intercepted transmission from Central Security . The possibility of using a Resonance Warhead is 97 % . It 's too late to go all in now ! Come on ! EMP detected . Concluded Deva has lost our coordinates . Little bit big for a letter of resignation huh . Entering drop point . ETA 34 minute before landing . OK . Target confirmed , ETA arrival 300 seconds . Destroy everything in sight . Fire at will . Let 's relieve our anger from living two weeks on Earth . Drop team ? Arriving before us ? Contact from HQ , they 've taken one Arhan . That 's the enemy . What ? Wait , what are you doing ? What a welcome back party . Although I told him to run , he won 't listen . Angela please try to convince him as well . Well you should change from that hard body first . Rude , what do you mean hard ? Now this is better . You understand the situation , right ? Central Security is about to swarm this place . You 'll die if you stay here . Man . I 'm just here cause I heard from an old customer that there 'll be business to do . Cause someone told me she would find me again . Are you serious ? You can 't survive on Earth if you quit your job . There 's no reward this time ! You 'll be working for free ! Then give me the robot after everything 's done . I 'll sell it at the junkyard . Well honestly , this once in a life time fireworks , I want to see it with my eyes . And send those uninvited guests back ! I did some preparation as well . This is a list of places you shouldn 't go near . Memorize it well . You 're really ! I told you I was crazy before , right ? Frontier Setter , how 's the launch preparation ? It 'll be completed after 1220 seconds . If we can buy enough time then we win . Work hard . Okay , let 's go ! Only one new generation Arhan landed . And 17 boxes of supplies . They want to fight with just one ? Stop the chit-chat ! To all units , the target is the HLV stored deep inside the silo . The mainframe of the rouge AI is in there . Be cautious of the enemy Arhan . Speak of the devil . SMA lost ! Use infrared to re-calibrate . Can 't ! It 's unresponsive ! Jamming smoke ? Trace the location of the missile . Movement detected at five o 'clock . Enemy ? No , it 's probably construction equipment . Construction equipment ? Shit ! Evasive maneuver ! Did it hit ? Five targets confirmed . The sixth one is heavily damaged . Good pace . Next container . There are still missiles remaining . No use . The Agents will take care of it quickly . That 's how we 're taught . Understood . Next point is B-2 . Roger ! No way she 's doing this solo . There must be a companion . All units , be careful . Always hiding in the corners , huh ? ! Still doesn 't make me feel good even if it 's just a material body ! She feels the same way too ? I 'm out ? ! Where 's the next container ? 400m at eight o 'clock . You little ! Unfortunately , their antenna is wide open . Dingo ! Take care of it quickly Angela ! Where 's the rest ? Second wave from the northeast . Eight units approaching . Additionally , five waves in total of forty units approaching . How 's the launch preparation ? ETA five minutes . This sucks . Hey , don 't give up now . Finishing what you 've started is what you call " Loyalty " Damn you ! Ow ! That was harsh ! Frontier Setter , how 's the countdown ? Very well . Everything is according to plan . What about the volunteers from Deva ? I 've received zero replies . Oh ! You still want to go now ? Even if you don 't have any companions . This is my proof of existence . Okay ! But I still have one hope of recruitment left . Angela Balzac . You left from Deva and lost your home . Would you like to go on a journey with me ? To the end of the galaxy ! Sorry ! I still don 't know this world well . There 's still a lot of things I haven 't seen ! Is that so ? That 's very unfortunate . Although it 's a shame , Operation : Genesis Ark , which leads humanity into a new world , must fulfill its promises . Well , Frontier Setter , there 's all sorts of humans . The definition of a human is very ambiguous . Singing songs , helping others , putting your dreams among the stars ! You 're already human . Is that so ? You 've remembered all the values of humanity and things we lost . So , stand tall and go . If you meet others on your journey , tell them your name with pride . Say you 're the descedents of humans . Understood . Thank you so much you two . I 'll spread the memories of this planet to worlds far away . Please . Sorry for giving all the work to you . We 'll cheer you on forever . Forever ! Dingo , Angela , I shall depart . ( ED ) Is he gonna be okay ? Well , it 's gonna be difficult . You should be the same . Now you 'll need to get used to living here . There 's gonna be surprises everywhere . Tell me about it , I 'm already really depressed . This stiff body , dusty atmosphere , sand everywhere you go , doesn 't this world have anything good ? Are you regretting it ? Well , nothing to say now . And I have a reliable guide . Such stupidity . This is already paradise . But we should learn form this event . Even if it 's an elite Agent , they 'll still be affected by humans from last generations , and fall . We need to govern more things . For the peace and thriving of Deva . It 's so far awayï ½  I wanna trace it outï ½  How many tears have I shed How much pain have I felt Poem without words Resonance hidden within our souls Clear blue sky and the horizon Flowers of hope blooming in the field Feeling the pain That has woken my strength If winds from before Pushed me forward To the future full of unknowns Let 's start the journey It 's so far away I wanna trace it out The sequel of the never ending story Even if it 's in the dark If you can find light in this wish From now , going through time Connected love Forever ! How many tears have I shed How much pain have I felt Poem without words Resonance hidden within our souls Clear blue sky and the horizon Flowers of hope blooming in the field Feeling the pain That has woken my strength If winds from before Pushed me forward To the future full of unknowns Let 's start the journey It 's so far away I wanna trace it out The sequel of the never ending stroy Even if it 's in the dark If you can find light in this wish From now , going through time Connected love Forever ! Reason for leaving footsteps From then on , I 've been searching Hurting each other The good days won 't return As long as I Have a smile in my heart From reading the broken signal Towards the other side of the noise Till I find myself I won 't be lost Starting over I wanna send it out To the future can 't be changed Never bow down to fate From the beat I 've heard in my memory From the place it beats There 's always a miracle Forever ! Thousands watching the sky The moon and stars Helping eachother in the sky If they can light the light of hope Then we could still meet again ! So long ! It 's so far away I wanna trace it out The sequal of the never ending stroy Even if it 's in the dark If you can find light in this wish Everything I see now Will be my motivation for tomorrow From now , going through time Connected love Forever !

 Forget what we saw . We 're here , and I don 't want to waste any more time . I 've been keeping a secret from you . Keiko--she 's in Los Angeles . Keiko Arahida . Your mom has posted your bail . This ring is a quantum entanglement device . This little thing prevents people from blacking out ? Hellinger wants to help you . Who 's Hellinger ? Hellinger 's our boss . You 're going to die , but your daughter 's gonna be better off when you 're gone . They had me install a piece of software . I can find out who made it and where it came from . You get me into N.L.A.P. I 'll tell you who caused the blackout . Janis , this guy has been lying to us about everything . And now you want to take him to N.L.A.P. ? How the hell do you trust this guy ? Her heart has stopped beating . She 's gone . No , no ! You do the math . You 're both part of the equation , both of you . I cannot be in that house with you tonight . At 10 : 00 P.M. , you have to here with me . On April 29th , I 'm gonna be on a bender . So why not start now ? Today 's the day daddy 's a die . Why are we stopping , mom ? 'Cause we 're just gonna sit here for a while . Okay . Oh , wow , look ! That one 's shaped a star . Yeah . Oh , look at that , mom . Yeah . Flight number 37 ... I 'm looking for a Keiko Arahida . I believe she 's being held here . Was . She was released an hour ago . Um ... did--did she say where she was going ? Not in English . Well , do you have a phone number for her ? Um , uh , there 's gotta be some sort of intake file , right ? You got a warrant , officer ? Listen , this Keiko- - I 've never met her . But I saw her in my flash-forward . I-I started drawing her . I have 20 canvases in my house of her . She was wearing this t-shirt of a Sushi restaurant just outside of Tokyo . So I flew to Japan . I flew to Japan because of a t-shirt . But I didn 't find her . I didn 't find her , and I thought that was my only shot . I know that she 's here in L.A. , and now maybe you have a phone number . She changed my life just because I saw her . That was really your flash-forward ? Yeah . It was . That 's amazing . Because in my flash-forward ... I had $ 100 in my pocket , and I couldn 't figure out for the life of me how it got there . This isn 't right . I saw her alive . So did you . I saw her . Okay . A pulse ? Yes . Very faint . Stay with me , Trace . I 'm begging you . Stay strong . Okay . Stay with me , Tracy . Stay with me . Just live , and we 'll wind up where we 're supposed to be . That 's it ... The la Honda access point . This is mile 6 of the accelerator 's 10-mile length . We get in there , I can get to the mainframe , find the software Hellinger 's men had me install , and use it to destroy them . You 'll use it to help us identify them . Right . That 's the deal . One of us needs to get this device close to the security guard 's access card . Then it 'll transmit its code to my cell phone . Okay . We 'll just get the rig close to the security guard that we 're trying to completely avoid . That sounds simple . Good stuff , Simon . This is gonna get us inside the gate . This is gonna get us inside everything . I know you don 't trust him . I trust you . If you 're here , I 'm here . Ohh . What 's the matter ? What 's going on ? I don 't know . Something 's not right . I think I did it back in my apartment . Okay , we 're going to the hospital . No , no . We have to do this tonight . We 're not gonna get a second chance . Janis . The FBI 's not gonna let him near that machine . Catching whoever is behind the blackout is more important than anything else . You need to do this . Please . Do it for me . Stan- - don 't tell me I won 't regret doing this . I already do . Let 's go . # Flash Forward 1x22 # Future Shock Original Air Date on May 27 , 2010 . Your snapping on Hellinger like that- - I take some responsibility . I let it happen . What the hell are you talking about ? We were so focused on finding when the next blackout is , I haven 't seen what 's been going on with you . Yeah , I 've been meaning to talk to you about your priorities lately . Wedeck . Sir , we 've found two bombs in the FBI with timers . There are probably more . Call in the bomb squad . I 'm on my way . Guess you 're coming with me . Hands on the wheel . Hands on the wheel . Get out of the car slow . Slow ! I need help ! Ma 'am , what are you doing here ? What 's taking so long ? ( Whisper well , she has to get the reader closer . ( Whisper well , she has to get the reader closer . Trying to find Pacific State Hospital on Old la Honda . Ma 'am ? Ma 'am ? Ma 'am ? Come on ! Wait . That looked real . She was hurting . I need an ambulance at la Honda access point . He 's getting her to a hospital . Come on . La Honda access point . We should be home now . It 's almost 10 : 00 . Mm-hmm . Well , we 're not . So then ... things can change ? Mm-hmm . Dylan ! What are you doing ? Hi , Charlie . Uh , sweetie , why don 't you take Dylan to the car and go get him a juice box ? Okay . Come on , Dylan . How did you find us ? Uh , well , actually , um , my people called your people . The bodyguards ? In my flash-forward , I think I was on the verge of--of figuring out something really crucial , but I think for that to happen , I have to be at your house . I have to recreate those conditions . Tell you what- - why don 't you let yourself in ? And then you recreate all the conditions you want . Listen to me . Listen . You 're part of it- - you and Charlie . It 's like Gabriel said . You 're part of the puzzle . How , exactly ? I don 't know . I just know that you are . This is bigger than you and me . We can 't stop it . I 've tried . Mark pushed me away to save the world- - no , I can 't push you away . Don 't you understand ? I can 't do this alone . Maybe you should . You 're part of the equation , and I cannot do it without you . What , uh , what are you doing here ? Did you find her ? They just released her . I got a contact number for her . It 's , um ... It 's the restaurant where I saw her in my flash-forward . Turns out it 's in L.A. It 's all coming true for you . Look , Bryce , I-I ... I just wanted to say that I 'm sorry . You know , she flew all the way across the Pacific Ocean just to meet you , and I ... I tried to keep you apart . No , I 'm sorry . This whole thing is my fault . I 'm sorry . I 've been ignoring the truth , the feelings that I had . I know it sounds crazy , but I love her . This whole thing with her was meant to be . I mean , I put these on this morning without a second thought . It wasn 't until half an hour ago that I realized this is what I was wearing in my flash-forward . - I gotta go . - Yeah . You should go . All liquids , gels and aerosols must be in 3-ounce or smaller containers . Uhh ! No , no , no , no , no . Hear me out . Wait . Hear me out . Whoever put those bombs in there is targeting something specific . So we need to figure out what . So help me , Mark , all the glorious choirs of heaven , if you step out of this car , I will have your head on a plate . I 'm gonna send over a driver . Stay in the car . You need a friend , so I tracked him down for you . Someone to keep you company while you wait . Hello ? Aaron , it 's Mark . Listen , I 'm okay , but I talked to Wedeck , and I need to know what 's going on with you . I don 't know . I just kind of lost it . And then ... And then I started to drink . You know ... Sometimes what happens in the world makes us forget it 's all up to us . We have choices- - you , me ... Tracy . You choose what 's next , and you 'll wind up right where you 're supposed to be . Take care of yourself , Mark . Okay . Agent Benford . Been celebrating ? A little . Had to get back to the office , though . Loose ends . There 's nothing to see up there , Mark . It 's a fool 's errand . Last time I listened to you , I took my eyes off the prize . Not gonna happen again . I have to go . Got a little errand to run . I have a new goldfish named Sadie . Can I see it ? Come on . It 's upstairs . I want cookies after . Dylan , that 's not how we ask . It 's okay . Mi casa es su casa . That means my house is your house , too . It 's my house , too . Come on . So ... So ... Uh , 9 : 33 . 27 minutes till your epiphany . Yeah . Uh ... okay . I think I 'd better get to work . All right . So how--how does this work ? We just take our positions at 10 : 00 , wait for your breakthrough ? Yeah , I think I 'll keep my shirt on this time . Okay . What the hell ? I don 't know what happened . Open this door . I don 't know what happened . Wait , let me just- - now , Simon ! I don 't know what happened . I knew you 'd try to pull something , you sociopathic , lying son ... You 're welcome . Come on in . Your friend asked you to trust me . Janis wanted me to help you . I do not trust you . This is the last piece of leverage I have left . And now you have it . Let 's get to work . Shall we ? Confirming devices on floors five , six and ten , over . You got a det time ? Affirmative . 36 minutes and counting . Copy that . What 's the update ? Bombs , Mark . We 've located them on at least five floors . This is bigger than Hellinger . Yeah . He 's just a link in the chain . They 're coming after Mosaic . Are you about to do what I think you 're about to do ? Your chances of making it out of there are not good . I need you to do something for me . If they 're coming after Mosaic , Lloyd Simcoe is not safe , either . Now I 've got this covered . I 'll secure Simcoe . - You can find him at- - - Your house . It 's what I saw . It 's ... It 's where I 'm going , right ? Right . Lock it down . You should know I also saw myself telling another Agent you were dead . Lloyd Simcoe 's key . We need him alive . Same goes for you . I 'll keep that in mind . Mom , come here ! My God . He got into your lipstick and just started writing . It 's the formula in my flash-forward . This is what I saw . How is that possible ? I always assumed I 'd written it . I guess Dylan must have memorized it this afternoon . Is he in trouble ? No . Can we get cookies now ? Sure . Uh , Charlie , why don 't you take Dylan downstairs and show him where they are ? I will , but he already knows . Come on , Dylan . So what is this ? What does it mean ? This equation somehow links the Q.E.D. , the blueprints and the flash-forward all together . But it 's a math problem , right ? How would it possibly tie all those things together ? It 's the tachyon constant . It 's the greatest mystery in all of quantum physics . And I have to solve it ... Right now . Evacuate the entire building ! Clear , blue team ! Clear ! I 've been waiting for you . I 'm really happy to see you . Everything 's gonna be okay . That 's what we saw , right ? I haven 't felt her move in three hours . We 're gonna get you an ultrasound . Ready . Okay . He 's where ? He 's in the building with the bombs ... where I left my car keys . We 've got 23 minutes until the building goes . We 've gotta get Benford . The answers will come . You sound so certain . At 10 : 00 P.M. , the answers will come ... because they will . It 's not about equations . It 's not about the two of us just physically being here . It 's about this moment ... Right here . I 've fought it and resisted it , and yet here it is . It happened . The future happened . All of it ? Somebody means business . Yeah , you got that right . You want up or down ? Down . Go for it . I got you covered . I 'm exactly where I 'm supposed to be . I 'm sorry . You can 't come in . Please , please . I 'm--I 'm supposed to meet a woman here . I learned Japanese . Private party ... Please- - ah ! Keiko ... Thank you . Try a different street , please . When I can get to one . I mean , the traffic 's nuts . Okay . I need to go . Thank you . All right , everybody . It 's almost 10 : 00 . Five more minutes till we catch up to our future ! You installed the software . Now you can 't find the file ? I 'm just not seeing it yet . Beer ? Beer ? Helps me cogitate . You know , Janis is gonna be okay . How do you know ? She saw it in her flash-forward . All righet 's get going . Someone could walk in here any second . It 's almost 10 : 00 . I 'm supposed to send Lloyd a text . What is that , math ? It 's an equation for a damped 1-dimensional wave . It was Lloyd 's e-mail signature for years ... A damped wave . He used to call it his " tearful good-bye . " That 's cute . Is that physics humor ? Well , I 'm supposed to send him something . He saw it . An inside joke for an inside joke . Four , three , two , one ! It 's 10 : 00 , everybody ! It 's the text from--from Simon . A wave . Good God . I have to make a call . Yeah . It 's me . Did you crack it ? Look , the constant I 've been looking for--it isn 't a number . It 's a wave . If I plug the wave into the blueprint equation , I get an interval which , if added to the previous blackout , tells us- - tells us what , Lloyd ? As precisely as I can tell , the next blackout is sometime in April 2010- - which means it 's in the next two days . Mark ? Mark ? Are you still there ? April ? April ? 2010 ? The baby 's fine . Good heartbeat . But it 's a boy . It 's a boy ? You disappointed ? No . Just surprised . Future is like that . Yeah . God , we 're almost through this thing . Finally go back to the way things used to be- - where the only stuff we see is what 's right in front of us . Welcome to the future . Who did this ? The rings are different . They moved . Gabriel . Make it look right . You make it look right . Gabriel . Gabriel . Gabriel . Gabriel . Gabriel . April ... Black ... Out . " T. " " T. " " E. " " N. " " F. " O. U. " R. " T. E. E. N. P.M. April 29th . 10 : 14 . The blackout- - it 's in 12 minutes . The command system won 't let me access it . What was it you said earlier ? Now the only thing we can see is what 's right in front of us ? Whoever did this may have copied the entire mainframe , created some kind of clone . Wait . So what you 're looking at is a ... A fake , designed to prevent me from getting in . They knew I 'd be back . Remember me ? Now all I have to do is backdoor into my archived account , compare the system , compare the code ... I have no idea what you 're talking about . Bye-bye . You got it ? Downloading it for you now . I don 't know who you work for , Mr. Hellinger , but whoever they are , they won 't be very happy that you didn 't prevent this ... Not at all . Done . Whatever you 'll need to track the bastards is in here . Okay . Hey . Sweetie , go . Go . Go play with Dylan . Mark Benford is dead . He ran into the building . Doesn 't have a chance . Okay . Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey . Are you okay ? Careful . What happened ? You went off the road into the lake . I-I wasn 't even sure you were with us . Then I pulled you out of the car , and you started fighting me . Hey , come on . Hey , you must be freezing . Here . Okay . There . Hey , it 's okay . It 's okay . In my flash-forward , I ... I saw myself saving you . And all these months ... I thought maybe I failed . I 'm , uh ... I 'm really happy that I didn 't . You saw me ? Yeah . Okay . An ambulance is on its way , okay ? Hey . My name 's Ed . Nicole . What ? What is it ? Someone 's accessing the mainframe from outside . What does that mean ? It 's a different command system originating off-site . They have control . Commencing activation sequence . What have you done , Simon ? Put your hands up ! now ! You lying son of a bitch . Hey , I didn 't do this , Demetri , not then and certainly not now ! I 'm going to let them do this to me , Demetri . I won 't let them turn me into a monster , to use my machine , my mind . Millions of people , Demetri- - millions of people don 't deserve to die . Know what ? You want to stop me ? You want to stop me from doing what I 'm doing , which is trying to shut down this machine ? Then you 're going to have to shoot me . Yeah ? It 's Mark . You 're still in the building ? Get the hell out now ! The next blackout- - I figured it out , Stan . It 's gonna be at 10 : 14 P.M. Pacific tonight . Call the White House , EBS , NTSB , everyone . This place is about to go in three minutes . Move now ! Make the call , Stan . Assistant Director Stanford Wedeck . Yes . Put me through to the White House now . Credible information that another global blackout will hit in minutes . Reporters speaking at once in foreign languages ) Mark ! Livy , listen very carefully . The next blackout 's about to happen . Take Charlie , get her somewhere safe . It 's gonna happen in about two minutes . Tell her I love her . I love you both . Please be safe , Mark . Good-bye , Livy . " President Segovia has issued an evacuation order " in light of credible reports that another global blackout will hit . " He 's urging immediate steps to be taken to ensure public safety and is appealing for calm . You might want to put that ring on . You know what ? I didn 't see my future the last time around . I 'm not gonna miss it this time . You want it ? I 've seen my future . This is it ... right now . What did you see ? You might want to sit down for this one . Ready ? Hang on ! I am ! Just hang on ! # I 'm coming up only # # to hold you under # # ' m coming up only # # to show you wrong # # ooh # # ooh # # really too late to call # # so we wait for # # morning to wake you # # it 's all we got # # to know me as hardly golden # # is to know me all wrong , they were # # at every occasion # # I 'll be ready for a funeral # Charlie , what is it ?

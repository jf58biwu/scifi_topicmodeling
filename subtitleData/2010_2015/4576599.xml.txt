 Rrrrrahhh ! Looks like someone needs to trim their nails ! Ahhhhhhhh ! Stop it ! You 're destroying everything ! AH ! The humanity ! Ugh ! Rahhh ! Ahhhhhh ! CLANG ! Ah ! Ah ! Ahhhhhhhhhh ! All this for a stupid beauty pageant . Which I won fair and square . But I rigged the whole thing . Your winning was part of the plan . Mimes don 't talk , Hannah ! ♪ Ahh ! Ahhh ! HiSSSSSS ! Ahhhhhhhhh ! CLANG ! THUD That 's it for you , evil wig . UH ! Well that 's the end of another adventure . Yeah , there were some real twists and turns in that one . Something tells me that 's not the last we 've seen of the Book . Seriously , how do you turn this off ? ! Oh Curtis . You never change . Hey ! You destroyed our whole AV lab ! It 's all we had ! This was our whole lives ! Look , in the fight against evil , sometimes shit happens , this time shit happened to your shit . It 's nothing personal . But who 's going to pay for all this ? ! I dunno . Nice yodeling , Jenny . I will get my revenge , Todd Smith ! Somehow . ♪ ♪ I can 't believe I never noticed you before you won that beauty pageant . It 's too bad so many people had to die . Hey , it 's not your fault Miss Crowley High . You won fair and square . And your yodeling was excellent . Oh , Lon , I bet you say that to all the girls . True , but with you I mean it . Hey how about we grab a coffee after school ? Or something - Yeah . I would love to . I 've got a date with a beauty queen . Wait till I tell my mom ! I 'm the one who saved Jenny from the Evil Wig , not that bumrod coffee drinker ! ♪ Bring up the music- - I don 't think we should be doing this - I 'm the head of this club . Now , shut up and do what I tell you ! Does anyone hear music ? ♪ Anyone ? ♪ And ... cut ! ♪ Lost shithead ? ♪ Cut ! ♪ You take a wrong turn somewhere buddy ? Well , you better get out of here unless you want to get slapped with 2 dildos ! ♪ Okay - Cut ! ♪ There 's a pretty , Daddy- - Curious . ♪ Oh , shi- - Cut ! ♪ Split-screen ! I don 't want to ! I said split-screen ! ♪ SLICE ! We never got to have our coffee date . You know there 's plenty of other guys who 'd like a coffee date . Like me . Now 's not the time , Todd . Hey , I 've got something that will cheer you up . Made you a mix CD . Seriously ? A guy I had a coffee date with , has been cut in half . And stop making me CDs ! I never listen to them . What , not even ' Songs To Dream of Todd To , Volume 7 ? ' That was a classic ! Hey , find anything ? We found the rest of Lon 's body . It 's cut clean in half . Who or what could have done this ? Curious-er ... Um ... A giant pizza cutter ? Oh ! A giant viking with a man-slicing axe ! A powerful plasma ray ? Then the wounds would have been cauterized- - You only know that word because I use it . You 're just jealous of my tiara . It 's so sparkly - So , what else could it be ? Maybe ... a sword ? A sword ? I thought I was the only dude around here with a sword . I think someone other than Todd having a sword in the school is highly improbable . We would have noticed . Unless he was really tall ... and hid it in his pants . I think that we have to consider all the possibilities here , because something is weird , even for Crowley High . Why her ? You really don 't know anything , do you , you idiot ? ! Through her we get to him . First we need to match Todd 's sword against Lon 's body , just to rule him out as a suspect . Seriously ? I 'm a suspect ? It 's nothing personal Todd , we have to be sure . There is a prophecy that says you could be the Pure Evil One , after all . Go short ! Stupid Prophecy- - Holy-Moley Miss Crowley ! Best in show ! Oh , you guys . You 're too kind- - Hey , shut up , you douche lords ! She doesn 't need attention from guys like you ! Yeah , whatever- - Jenny , you 're lucky you have me to protect you from guys like that . I can speak for myself , Todd ! You 're acting like a jealous boyfriend ! Yeah ! You 're like a stalker ! I 'm not a stalker ! I 'm- - I 'm more of a bad boy . Yeah ! He 's dangerous . And that kinda scares you . But it also kind of excites you too . You just don 't know it yet ! Seriously , dude , not helping . And ... Wipe ! SPLAT ! Test , one two- - Test- - How am I a stalker ? I mean , I love Jenny- - I know we 're meant to be together . tap-tap And this year 's Miss Crowley High is- - Damn it , there 's too much blood in this thing , man- - Jenny just can 't see it yet . I just have to convince her . But , I mean , how does that make me a stalker ? You know what I 'm talking about , right Jimmy ? Listen , man , I totally know what you mean- - There was this one chick , right ? We were totally in love , she just didn 't know it yet . So , I followed her to her room hid under her bed , and she still just didn 't get that we were meant to be together . So then I showed her the pictures I took when she was sleeping , totally freaked out- - Which I didn 't get because that was proof to me that if I wanted to do something bad , I could 've . You know what I 'm saying ? Shit . I am a stalker . I gotta stay away from Jenny . This year 's Miss Crowley High is ... Jenny Kolinsky ! What do you want , Todd ? We 're meant to be together Jenny . What are you talking about ? I am a stalker ! Okay , not funny . I can 't stay away from you . This is sick even for you . I 'm talking about love - love - love . Ok , seriously ? I 'm hanging up ! I am a stalker . Don 't call me again ! I gotta- - shit . Don 't even talk to me again ! What 's got your panties in a knot little missy ? Mind your own business . Your friend Todd has quite the reputation . What reputation ? He 's a Pure Evil loser . He 's not Pure Evil . He 's a good guy . He just doesn 't always think about what he 's doing and doesn 't always ... know when to stop- - You know what ? What do you guys know about it anyway ? Hey , we don 't know nothin but what we see with our own 2 eyes . Come on- - We see the way he follows you around . The way he looks at you . The way he smells your hair when you ain 't looking . Like a loser ... in heat . You really think he 's gonna be able to control himself forever ? Those flirty jocks have been crushed . Is Todd still a suspect ? Well , the test of the sword against Lon 's body proved inconclusive . Whoa- - What could have done this ? Angry giant ? Angry giant bulldozer ... ? Well good luck finding the Book . I 'm gonna have to sit this one out . You 're quitting the Gang again ? I just think I need to stay away from Jenny for a little while . Because you 're stalking her ? No , I 'm not stalking her ! I just- - I know she gets distracted by my manliness . That 's it Todd ! You 're delusional ! I 'm not into you ! I 've never been into you ! But you just can 't take the hint , can you ? Calling me up , telling me that you have to take a shit ? ! What is wrong with you ? ! Whoa , Jenny , calm down ... But I don 't have to take a shit ... First Lon , and now these guys ? They were just flirting with me , and now they 're dead ! Did you do this ? Did you go all Pure Evil on them ? I didn 't do anything- - You know what ? None of us know what you 're capable of ! You could be responsible for all this and not even know it ! We don 't know that Todd did this , Jenny Yeah , sure , take his side Hannah- - Look Listen . What does that mean ? Boring ! Yeah ... who cares about wrong numbers ? Let 's get to the good stuff . See ? I told you it would be fun . ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ So hand me those flowers of sorrow ... What the hell ? ... here I stand ... Best . Dream . Ever . Oh , yeah - Yeah , that 's good , Jenny ... Oh , Jenny ... Oh , yeah ... ♪ Ahhhhhhh ! What are you doing ? ! I 'm dreaming- - No you 're not ! Ahhhhhhh ! ... so I was in her room and then I jumped out the window and ran naked all the way home . My feet got really dirty . Whoa , what a weird dream . Dirty feet . Dude , are you even listening to me ? I was actually in Jenny 's closet jerking off ! Wow . That does sound like stalker behaviour . Yeah , but I thought I was dreaming ! I don 't even know how I got there ! Maybe you were sleep-wanking . Or maybe I 'm blacking out and turning into the Pure Evil One without even knowing it . Well , if all the Pure Evil One does is black out and jerk off ... That 's not so bad . Todd needs to be locked up until we figure out what 's going on . Don 't you think you 're being a bit rash ? He was jerking off in my closet ! I can 't imagine Todd choosing to do that . I mean , sure he 'd fantasize about it , but he can 't be responsible for all this . He just can 't . Maybe he 's not choosing . Maybe he 's already become the Pure Evil One . And if Todd 's lost control , I 'm not gonna be his next victim ! Are you even listening to me right now ? ! I can 't believe you 're checking your texts ! What- - Jenny , I 'm sorry ! I dn 'n't normally get texts ! I was excited ! It 's working ! Our plan is working ! Stupid nerds . Not so stupid after all . Especially with a little help from the Book of Pure Evil ! Well ... this is unexpected . What should we do ? We 're gonna get expelled for this ! Just stay calm ... and observe . Nerds ! Hand over the Book ! We don 't have any books . Take it ! Hey ! This Book isn 't going anywhere until Todd Smith 's life is completely destroyed ! You 're using the Book to destroy Todd Smith ? Hmm ! Allow me to offer a proposal . I 'll let you keep the Book until after your little vendetta , then you will give me the book ! Yeah , that sounds reasonable . Excellent , I 'm gonna stay and watch . ♪ Got any snacks ? Some party mix ? Okay , listen- - If I really am the Pure Evil One , I 'll say anything I can to get out of this room . Curtis , no matter what I say do not let me out of here . Got it . But if you do let me out , you can have all my comics . Wicked ! That was a test . You just failed . Okay- - Shit ! Okay- - Starting now . You are not getting out of that room ! Ok , but I really have to use the bathroom . Okay you go I 'll stay ! Curtis , that was also a test . Man ! You 're too smart for me ! I know . This sucks , I 'm gonna keep stalking and killing people forever . Todd , we don 't know for sure that you 're doing those things . Jenny thinks I am , and that 's all that matters . You gotta start thinking about something else . something wholesome , family entertainment , like Herman : The Kid Detective . Really , Hannah ? I don 't know ... reading 's kinda for nerds . Who keeps texting me ? It 's okay , dude . Go . Why are they wasting so much time on such a boring subplot ? Those kids are always wasting their time on stupid tangents . Fast forward to the good stuff . Dennis ! Fast forward ! ♪ thump-thump That 's more like it . ♪ It was indeed the snake-handler 's niece . Ramp up the tension ! Give me some music stings ! Todd ! Get out of here ! I don 't even know how I got in here ! Cut ! Stay away from me ! Cut ! Gah ! I 'm trying ! WHACK ! What the fuck ? WHACK ! WHACK ! WHACK ! Ugh ! WHACK ! WHACK ! WHACK ! WHACK ! She 's giving him a real ass pounding ! Pound that ass , Jenny ! Dennis ! It 's not what it looks like ! You 're on your cell phone during a movie ! Nerds ! Supporting characters ! We forgot about you ! We know you have the Book - hand it over and you might make it out of this alive ! No promises . Yeah , our track record is pretty spotty . Never ! I must see Todd destroyed for what he did to us ! What exactly did Todd do to you ? I don 't even know who you guys are . Todd destroyed all of our audio-visual equipment ! What ? You were there ! Don 't you remember ? I smoke a lot of pot . And Todd destroys a lot of stuff . AV Club was all we had in life , and Todd completely destroyed it , so now we 're going to destroy Todd ! You know , you should have just killed him , it would have been far easier . Just sayin ' . Killing Todd 's not enough . I wanna crush him completely by turning the woman he loves against him . It will be my masterpiece ! ♪ WHACK ! WHACK ! WHACK ! ♪ ♪ I know I should be happy , but she 's just so sad ! I did it ... holy shit ! I did it ! I actually did it ! YOU BASTARD ! ♪ Stay away from me ! I 'm trying ! What the fuck ? Curtis be careful ! Lose - This year 's Miss Crowley 's High- - Fuck . You wouldn 't want to go to the movies with me . Hold on ! Ahhhhhhhhhhh ! Whoa ! I 'm just gonna have to finish you myself , Todd Smith ! Let 's do the man dance , man . You ruined my life ! Yeah ? You totally fucked up mine ! It was him right ? I 'm not the Pure Evil One yet ? Not yet . You know , I 'm totally gonna kick your ass , dude . Yeah , you 're right . I 'm just gonna use the book to kill you . Where is it ? Dennis- - Well this is unexpected . Give that back ! That 's an order ! I ' w waited a long time for this Reggie You think it 's easy being second in command of a two person club ? I made you who you are ! When you first came to this school , you were nothing . Just another snot nosed kid with no social skills . I gave you an identity ! I gave you power ! And that was your downfall . AHHHHHHHHH ! SPLAT ! Whoa ... You sent the text messages that lead us here . Indeed it was I. Why did you sell Reggie out ? Reggie was an asshole . Stupid nerds ! I could see this ending coming a mile away . I always guess the ending . You wouldn 't want to go to the movies with me . ♪ With Reggie gone , it looks like the AV Club needs a new " head " . What ? Too soon ? I 'm sorry I didn 't trust you , Todd . Forgive me ? I 'll forgive you if you go on a date with me . Too soon . Hey , do any of you guys want to join the AV club ? No ! Should we tell them that Jenny killed Todd ? Hmmm , let 's keep that our little secret . We have more DVD-R 's than you can shake a stick at ! It 's clear to me that Todd 's strength lies not in his stupid tenacity but in his alliance with his insipid yet very helpful friends . And in order to defeat Todd and the Gang and finally get my hands on the Book of Pure Evil , I 'm going to need friends of my own . Yes indeedy . Daddy . No , Atticus . Not friends . Not friends ? No ! What you need is ... an army ! I could do ... an army .

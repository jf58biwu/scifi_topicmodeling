 Sieg Heil , Mondjugendunterführerin Renate Richter ! Boys and girls , please sit down . Dieter , don 't you know where to put your behind ? Since Mondführer 's 65th birthday , the appropriate salute has been Heil Kortzfleisch ! You 're such an exemplary boy . Today , we 'll start with the most unpatriotic language . It 's the language we need to know when we return to those who need our help . Attention ! The National Anthem . What is that , Mr. Adler ? A spy from the Earth . I captured him myself . He seems to be the leader of the shock troops . Mr. Adler , is this a joke ? I 'll be damned ! You understand English , don 't you ? What did he say ? My sweetheart . Mr. Adler . Mr. Nachrichtenübermittlungsoberführer Adler ? What 's for lunch today ? - Sauerkraut . - Again ! Please say that 's not true . Führer eats Sauerkraut three times a week as well ? Capture him ! No ! Capture him ! Don 't shoot ! The fugitive is a male negro unarmed , but possibly angry . What does he look like ? Where does he come from ? What is he wearing ? How do I look ? Like they say in English ... Klaus ! Don 't shoot . We need him for tests ... - Take him to Dr. Richter 's laboratory . - By your command ! Dumb negro . - He talks nonsense . - It might be a dialect . Probable reason is the skin colour . Right . His brain structure is different from us Aryans . Let 's open up his skull and measure the brain . No . I need to know why he 's here . You have 24 hours , Doctor . Otherwise I have to rely on an ancient , infallible technique . Pain . Ridiculous . - Mr. Adler . - Call me Klaus . May I ? Of course . I 've come to discuss our legal union . - Is that a marriage proposal ? - There 's no need for marriage . I received confirmation from the Department of Racial Purity . Our genetic match is 97 % . How romantic . Science demands us to unite physically . It 's our destiny to produce perfect offspring for the people . What about my scientific research ? One day , Renate ... all this will be ours . But first , I must conquer the Earth . Wolfgang , the old fart , stands in my way . In the way of final victory . The two of us will take on an enormous responsibility . Your place is by my side . I feel honoured . Renate . Let 's exercise goose step together . Let me nest in your eagle 's nest . The flag on high ! Eyes tightly closed ! Mr. Adler ... Klaus ... Here . This is what you should research . I made a dog-ear on page 65 . Thank you . Nazi Intercourse Handbook Gentlemen ! Battleship Götterdämmerung . Our miracle weapon that has been under development for 40 years . The dream of our beloved Führer . But unfortunately only a dream , until now . Please , Doctor . Watch this ! This tiny device has over a thousand times more computing power than our biggest computers together . I engineered this cable to connect this machine with our main computer . I call this Universal Systematic Binding , USB for short . This will lift it into the air . Finally , the Götterdämmerung will fly ! - Yes . - Yes . Yes . You saw it ! You saw it with your own eyes ! Mein Führer , please , let me return to the Earth . Let me get more of these devices . No one has ever returned . I will return . We don 't have a choice if we want to prevent an invasion from the Earth . Mr. Nachrichtenübermittlungsoberführer Adler . Looks good . This will solve our little problem . I 'm coming . Looks very good ! And now we just ... Why don 't you take me with you ? Don 't worry , darling . After I 've completed my mission , I 'll come back to you . That 's not what I mean . I 'm an earthologist ! I know everything about it . You need me . You sweet little thing , where do you get all those crazy ideas ? Books , mostly ... And some films . I shall return triumphant ! Heil Kortzfleisch ! Get it through your skull . Of course , mein Führer . We have one more ace up our sleeve . Show him what we have . Voilà , gentlemen ! Doctor . Watch closely . Stand up , you fool . Oberführer Adler , I hope you 've discussed my return to the Earth . Something along those lines . The Reich trusts you . Thank you , Doctor . - Take care of your daughter for me . - Yes . See you in Valhalla . Renate ! What are you doing here ? This is not the place for the mother of the children of the future Führer . And definitely not the place for a woman . My place is by my man . Get us a vehicle . A Volkswagen bus . - Doesn 't he know ? - No . He 'll be thrilled . Thank you . It 's time . Yes , today we have a surprise for you , Adler . Good evening , boys . The name 's not Hitler ! Do it , Moon Corporal . And you want to eliminate the Mondführer ? Do you know the penalty for high treason ? This is flagship Siegfried speaking . We 've reached the orbit and we 're ready for the Valkyries to start . Battleship Heinrich ready for attack . Battleship Biterolf ready for attack . The fleet is ready , mein Führer . Excellent . Tell them to wait for my return . We shall then begin the Meteorblitzkrieg . We 'll wipe all these sub-humans ... off the face of the Earth . Oh , well . A blessing in disguise . Now I can kill all the enemies of the Reich in one stroke . Farewell , puppet Führer . They develop like ordinary women . But look . No hair here , nor here . Like little girls . And when they do have hair , it looks like ... The moustache of our great Führer . The pictures kind of turn me on . Mr. Adler . Where 's the Führer ? The Führer is dead . Long live the new Führer . That 's me , in case you 're wondering . - Sieg Heil ! - This way . From now on , of course , it 's Heil Adler . Time is the sin . I 'll see you in Valhalla . At 5 : 45 , we 'll start firing back . Every bomb will be retaliated . The Meteorblitzkrieg shall begin ! Heroes of the First Fleet , continue your attack to the last man and remember , you 're fighting for the Reich ! Where the hell did they come from ? Prepare an appropriate uniform for the Führer . The Fatherland is calling its children ! This device will complete the biggest war machine of all times . - The Götterdämmerung will fly ! - Heil Adler ! Attention ! As you were . Well ? The Earth fleet will be within firing range in 20 minutes . - Are your troops ready ? - We 're waiting for Dr. Richter . Move ! Who dares disturb me ? Doctor Richter ! How much time do you need ? The Götterdämmerung will fly . It will be ready for the final victory . Cut the crap . How long ? Let 's say three months , give or take a little . You have three minutes . He cut me off . It 's not that easy . Russia wasn 't conquered in a day ... Start the helium-3 engines . Now ! Start the engines . Load the cannons . Shit ! - Are the cannons ready to fire ? - They are . But the Earth is below the horizon , on the other side of the Moon . We can 't shoot . Full moon was yesterday . Let 's make a brand new horizon . Fire at will . Reactivate the systems . Weapons NCO . We 'll see ... The projectiles of the Götterdämmerung are made out of metallic hydrogen . Its aggregate state can only be reached under immense pressure . NATIONAL ANTHEM for motivation break glass The impact can be quite diverse . It 's no time to sing now ! It 's a false alarm ! Are you all imbeciles ? Go and see what 's going on ! On the double ! Renate ... I won 't let you do it . What will you do ? Shoot me ? Good girl ... Renate Richter , my bride-to-be . You destroyed something beautiful , something wonderful . A future world full of Aryan children . Our Aryan children ! But you betrayed me , and for that you shall pay . - Your beauty shall adorn Odin 's table . - Klaus ! Wait ! Let me say something . Now ? I 'm a bit busy . I 've always respected you . As Führer , and as a man . I 've even loved you . I belong to you . To you . Cute little speech . But it 's too late , my dear . Goodbye . I understand . I hail you . My Klaus . Sieg Heil , mein Führer ! Please don 't , never again ! Please stop . What was the Earth like ? Different . When can we go there ? Soon . Soon ... But how ? In peace . The End

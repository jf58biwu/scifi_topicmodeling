 Previously on Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D ... You really felt nothing for them ? I spent time with Coulson , he 's a good man . Is that your badge ? They look like coordinates . MAN " . Welcome , Agent Coulson . We 've been expecting you . What is this place ? One of Fury 's secret bases . Eric Koenig , Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. , Level 6 . What about Ward ? He and Agent Hand should 've dropped Garrett off at the Fridge by now . S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s most secure facility is vulnerable right now . Yeah , well , we 're gonna raid it . This is a hard drive with all of Simmons ' research . She programed it to erase all data if anyone other than her attempts to access it . GARRETT 1 You know what that means , Romeo ? You got your story straight ? I just need time alone with her to get the information . Another example of this administration 's lack of transparency . WOMAN " . You can 't seriously be blaming the President for this ? Those who let S. H. I. E. L. D. operate without oversight should be held accountable . If your party held the White House , would you be taking this position ? If my party held the White House , we wouldn 't be in this position . I need a ride . - Sorry , what ? - I need a ride to Portland . Sorry dude , I 'm not going 200 miles out of my way to give you a ride . Okay . Somehow , it 's someone else 's fault ? At the very least ... What the ... All right , I give up . How 'd you do that ? Like this . We cannot allow HYDRA and their allies to rise again . I 'm afraid this might scar . Upside , you 'll look badass . Dangerous . He 's gonna be fine , though , right ? He will if you back up and give me some room . So what then ? By the time we got to the Fridge , it was too late . It was overrun . HYDRA everywhere . We couldn 't stop them . - What were they after ? - Everything . They took weapons , alien artifacts , anything they could grab . I assume that means the prisoners are no longer prisoners ? So Ian Quinn ? I 'm sorry . He 's out . They all are . And Garrett . Did he get away ? Couldn 't stop them from taking the Fridge , but I wasn 't gonna let Garrett walk , not after what he did . Is he the one that did this to you ? He was a tough son of a bitch . We need to make it believable . Was ? Past tense ? As soon as I had the upper hand , I put two in the back of his head . - Good . - One from me . One from you . I would have emptied the mag . You 're all set . Well , I mean , as set as you can be with two cracked ribs , and a zygomatic fracture . Uh , for those of you that don 't know what that is ... That 's a hairline fracture to the cheekbone . Your body needs time to heal . Please , take some time . Understood . Thanks . Ah . One small victory , HYDRA didn 't get their hands on this . A hard drive ? It 's all the research our team 's ever done , downloaded off the plane and encrypted for safekeeping . We should probably back it up now that we 're in a secure facility . First , Skye , I need you on threat assessment . Pull up a list of all the inmates at the Fridge . I wanna know just how bad this is . This is really , really bad . Quinn is the least scary of the bunch , and he shot me twice . Quinn 's more a sociopath . A lot of those inmates are full-blown psychopaths . Violent . Impulsive . And some with superpowers . Lovely . Is Marcus Daniels on the list ? That 's him . Cross check the list of inmates with crime databases , recent activity . Got a feeling we 'll be seeing a slight uptick . Okay , but that 'll take time and more computing power than my laptop . Agent Koenig probably has some sort of ... I 'm sure he 'll lend a hand . The plane you flew in on , is it operational ? Yeah . You need me to pilot ? You heard Simmons . You stay and get better . I 'm gonna take a splinter team out and start going after inmates on that list . Starting with Mr. Daniels . I think I know where he 's going . Uh , you sure it 's wise to split up the team , leave this base ? What if it 's part of HYDRA 'S plan ? A distraction ? She 's got a point . I mean , Fury brought you to this base for a reason . We 're safe here . Yeah , we 're safe here . But what about everyone else ? People who don 't happen to have access to a top-secret underground shelter ? What about them ? I don 't know if it 's wise , but it 's right . I 'm taking a team and that 's the end of it . No you 're not . Absolutely not . You can 't leave . There are protocols . Since the entire agency 's pretty much collapsed , maybe now 's not the time to stand on protocol . Okay , fine , then forget protocols . What part of " secret base " don 't you get ? Fury said to let you in , and you show up with a bunch of people ? - Agents . - Whatever . The point is , they know where this place is now , and I don 't know them . HYDRA just released the entire population of the Fridge into the wild . There 's gonna be violence . People will die . And I still consider it my duty to be the shield that protects them . Moving speech , truly , but nobody leaves until they go through orientation . Orientation ? All right . Just gonna need you guys to answer a few questions . A few psychoanalytic , non-sequitur questions . A lie detector ? The lie detector , Agent Coulson . This baby measures galvanic skin response , oxygen consumption , micro expressions , biofeedback brain waves , pupil dilation , voice biometrics . 96 variables in all . Fury designed this himself . He wanted a lie detector Romanoff couldn 't beat . - Did she ? - Like Fury would tell . Okay , sooner we get this done , sooner we can get to work . So who wants to go first ? We 're gonna start with some easy questions and establish a baseline . Can I have your full name ? Melinda Qiaolian May . - Eye color ? - Brown . - You ever been married ? - Once . - Have you ever been married ? - No . - Please , list your immediate family . - Just me and my mum . So you 're not gonna mention your grandfather ? That 's not something I advertise . Didn 't wanna be treated any different ' cause I 'm a legacy . If I was the grandson of a Howling Commando , I 'd have that tattooed on my chest . - What is your first name ? - Skye . And what is your last name ? Only name . No family , no family name to inherit . And you gave yourself the name Skye ? Well , the name they gave me at the orphanage was Mary Sue Poots . When we were kids , my brother and I use to give each other nicknames . He called me Lightning Foot . What 's the difference between an egg and a rock ? Edible . Not . Well , that 's absurd . The differences are ... innumerable . If you want , I can start listing them , but then ... We 'll be here all day . Have you ever heard of Project Insight ? - No . - No . Ever had any contact with Alexander Pierce ? I 've met him . We shook hands . Garrett would get a call from him once in a while . Said they had mutual friends . You wash up on a deserted island alone . Sitting on the sand is a box . - What is in that box ? - Machete . A sat phone , so I can call someone to get me off that island . How big is the box ? Just say the first answer that comes into your mind . What 's in that box ? Simmons . That 's a hard one . Let me think . The TARDIS . I wanna say my laptop , fully charged , but I don 't wanna seem subversive . - With the Rising Tide and all ... - You 're overthinking it . The laptop would be stupid anyway , there 's no Wi-Fi . S.H.I.E.L.D. no longer exists . The Agency has been labeled a terrorist organization . So , why are you here ? Honestly , I 'm not entirely sure . We have to stick together . Keep the people we trust close by . No one else really . My grandfather fought HYDRA back in the day . The good guys won then . We 'll do it again . Coulson . It 's the only home I 've ever known . Congratulations , Agent Skye . Let 's go get you a lanyard . Got my backstage pass . Piece of cake ? If you don 't mind talking about yourself . So , you 'll hate it . Have fun . What is your full name ? My name is Grant Douglas Ward . Please , list your immediate family . Two parents , a sister , two brothers . I don 't have contact with any of them . Boy , your baseline is getting a lot of spikes . Are you in pain ? Yeah . Only when I breathe . Two broken ribs . Okay , well , try not to move , it may affect the results . I 'll try my best . Marcus Daniels was an assistant at a physics lab where they were trying to harness electrical power of something called Darkforce . Nothing bad ever happens when you work with something called Darkforce . It 's a form of cosmic radiation , pure negative energy . Unstable , but powerful . You knew that already , didn 't you ? Daniels was exposed , ended up being able to absorb energy . All types . But the human brain and the heart run on electrical impulses . Exactly . He can kill with one touch . I 'm guessing he likes to ? Do we need to put a bullet in him ? Unfortunately , it 's not that simple . He can absorb the energy of most conventional weapons . He sounds unstoppable . Like Fitz said , his power 's unstable . Last time , we managed to capture him by overloading his system with pure light . Exposing him to more energy than he can absorb at once . I 'm sure we can engineer some sort of delivery mechanism en route . That 's what I was hoping you were gonna say . You mind flying , being the specialist on mission ? Sir , I 'll be whatever you want me to be . That 's what I was hoping you were gonna say . What is the difference between an egg and a rock ? Egg 's a food . Rock 's a weapon . Have you ever heard of Project Insight ? - No . - Ever made contact - with Alexander Pierce ? - No . You wash up on a deserted island alone . Sitting on the sand is a box . What 's in that box ? Depends on the island . Where is it , how big , what 's the terrain , is there fresh water ? Just say the first thing that comes to your head . A pistol . S.H.I.E.L.D. no longer exists . The Agency has been labeled a terrorist organization . So , why are you here ? I 'm an Agent . It 's my duty . I need you to give that to me again . It 's my duty . I 'm gonna ask you a follow up . Agent Ward , are you associated with HYDRA ? Yes . We all are . They 've infiltrated the highest levels of our organization . Like you mean it . Are you HYDRA ? I 'm loyal to S.H.I.E.L.D. , to Agent Coulson and to my team . Do you have another agenda here ? I 'll give you 24 hours to get the password and get out . After that , well , cross off the team and bring the girl to me . Agent Ward , why are you really here ? Skye . Came back for her . I wanna spend time with her . Skye ? Cool . Hey ! Ward ! Hey . Got my lanyard . Nice . $ 0 , you guys taking Off ? Yeah , I wish you were coming , instead of Trip . He 's insufferable , isn 't he ? - Trip ? - Yeah . Think the guy 's okay . I know , he 's terrible . He 's a horrible person . You sure this is about him ? Not about Simmons ? What the hell does that mean ? Everything is falling apart around us , we don 't know how it 'll end . If there 's something you wanna tell her , don 't wait . Maybe Simmons should check you again for a head injury . 'Cause that is not the Ward I know . You know what ? Do what you want . I don 't care . Good to have you back . I should be flying this mission . I made another call . Stay here . Get the fuel line repaired on the bus . I remember when you brought Daniels in . I know how personal this is for you ... We don 't do personal . Not anymore . Phil , the polygraph cleared me . I 'm not hiding anything . You mean , you 're not hiding anything else . Unless you do know who was behind the T.A.H.I.T.I. Project ? I didn 't ask . I was ordered not to . And you would 've done the same thing . Our job is to follow orders . It 's also our job to determine right from wrong . Watching someone in agony , searching for the truth , not saying anything ? That 's wrong . Look , I was just trying ... Don 't tell me it 's because you care so damn much . Fury 's no longer around , telling you what to do . So why are you here ? You want some orders to follow ? Follow mine . Or find somewhere else to be . How can you be sure he 's going to Portland ? Daniels was obsessed with a woman there . He called her his only light in the darkness . That 's almost romantic . Almost . The man 's been locked up in the Fridge for years . He must be over her by now . Some people are hard to get over . Besides , Daniels is pathologically insane . Single-minded . Obsessive . His powers not only robbed him of a normal life , they also pretty much fried his brain . What about the woman ? Audrey Nathan . She 's how we tracked him the first time . We find Ms. Nathan , we find Daniels . Audrey Nathan ? What ? There 's a man after me ! We know . We 're with the CIA . Get in . Mr. Daniels , we don 't wanna hurt you . We need to take you in . For your safety , and the safety of others . It was you . You took me there . They did things to me there . They were trying to contain you . No . They were trying to make me stronger . And they did . Here 's where we 'd normally call for reinforcements . Where did he go ? Here 's something . Police report out of Morocco . Attempted murder . The victim says the guy appeared out of nowhere , disappeared into thin air . Yeah , you just described every mugging ever . Aren 't you clever ? Aren 't you sneaky ? Using these to keep watch on all of us . What ? We 've been killing ourselves trying to guess where these guys went . But what if we could see it ? Get visuals on where the prisoners went after leaving the Fridge ? That 's a good idea , but right now , S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s sat surveillance is dark . Ours aren 't the only ones up there . The only other satellites in the vicinity that could ... The NSA . You wanna hack the NSA ? That 's a bad idea , Skye . That 's a terrible idea . The NSA 's already got S.H.I.E.L.D. on its watch list . Why poke the bear ? The big , scary , waterboarding bear . Oh , I thought you were a comms agent . Not agent of playing video games while hiding in a bunker . You can 't goad me to ... Can you help me convince Steve Rogers here to suit up ? Grab his shield . Head into battle . Okay . Who 's he supposed to battle ? If we hack NSA satellites , we can get footage from the Fridge breakout . See who was there . Where they went . She 's right , it 's worth trying . You know , I can 't hack the NSA , but maybe I can upload the hard drive you gave me . Get specs on the weapons they might be carrying . Absolutely , we should , but we can 't . The encryption is location-based . We 'll have to take a field trip at some point to decrypt it . Okay . All right . Color me impressed . Now impress me more . Get me that footage . These are the keys to the Comm-Sat room . The mainframe 's in there . Start the hack , but then send the feed to these monitors . - Let 's live dangerously . - Yeah ! - How long before you get visuals ? - Uh ... NSA satellites should be tough . Give me an hour . Great . This is exciting . Let 's see if being sneaky pays off . We should be safe here . - I thought he was locked up . - He escaped from prison . You don 't have to worry . That 's why we 're here . We 're gonna keep you safe . " We ? " Meaning the CIA ? Of course . That 's what I said , isn 't it ? We 're the CIA . The Central Intelligence Agency people . You 're not . You 're S.H.I.E.L.D. , aren 't you ? We 're just trying to help . We 're not the bad guys . I know . I don 't believe what they 're saying about S.H.I.E.L.D. The Agency saved my life once before . A few years ago , I saw Daniels at one of my concerts . Front row . Then I started seeing him at all of them . At first , I was flattered . Cellists don 't get groupies . But then one night , I saw him outside of my house . I was terrified . I begged him to leave me alone . He just stood there saying , I was his light . I didn 't understand what he meant , until he started blacking out my entire block . I ran and called the police . They didn 't believe me . But then a S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent came to my door . I don 't know why , but I trusted him right away . Something about his face . The handsome part , maybe . He just swooped in . It was like out of a movie . You two were close ? Very . He promised me he would stop Daniels , and that 's exactly what he did . That 's why I know I can trust S.H.I.E.L.D. Phil never lied to me . - Phil ? - Agent Phillip Coulson . I 've heard the name . Is that ... Audrey was ... You two were ... - Yeah . - Okay . What happened to him ? He died in the line of duty . I don 't know the details . We were planning a trip up the coast , and then I got the call . You must miss him . For so long after he died , everything reminded me of him . I still dream about him sometimes . Just us together , laughing . I wake up feeling like he 's watching over me . It 's nice . Maybe you should go in there . No , she 's healing . She 's getting on with her life . We should help her do that . I think I know a way how to stop Daniels for good . But we would have to use her to draw him out . No . Do you understand ? That 's not acceptable . It 's not ideal , but there 's no other choice . I won 't put her in danger again . That 's not fair to her . But , sir . I 'm sorry , but she 's already in danger . And you said it yourself . Daniels is single-minded , he 's dangerous . He won 't stop until he gets what he wants . How 's it coming ? Is the bus operational ? Still banged up , but she 's ready to fly . The fuel line 's repaired and the tank 's full . What 's the range on this thing ? Just under 10,000 miles . Are you leaving ? Yeah . I was here for Coulson . But he can 't see past me lying to him . I get why you did it . When you get orders , you don 't question them . You follow them . No matter the price . Yeah , well this price was too high . I lost him . Coulson doesn 't want me here . He doesn 't need me . So what should I tell him ? Whatever you want . He won 't hear it . How 's it going ? Oh , hey , believe it or not , Skye got us in . We have access to NSA 's complete sat feed history . That girl 's good . I can see why you like her . The images are a little patchy , but they 're gonna clear up any second . I guess living on the edge really pays off sometimes . Yeah . Sometimes . What if he doesn 't show ? Before they put him away , he never missed a rehearsal , right ? - No . - Then he won 't this time either . Don 't worry . We 'll be close . All you need to do is keep playing until Daniels gets close to the stage . We 'll do the rest . Last time , there were two whole teams of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents . See up there ? Our best agents are watching . I promise . They won 't let anything happen to you . I pulled these from the jet 's power reserves . Simmons made me wear gloves . She 's so uptight , that one . Sir ? Good . Can they stop him ? Okay , well this will modify the frequency and wavelength of the stage lights , although , technically , they wouldn 't be lights at that point . - More like gamma rays . - Tell me this 'll work . I gave Daniels to S.H.I.E.L.D. to rehabilitate him . It turns out , they just gave him an upgrade . Well , I mean , there 's a slight chance he would absorb the energy and gain more power . But it 's unlikely . Who did you say created this technology again ? Bruce Banner . Then I 'm sure it 'll go off without a hitch . Eric ? Eric ? You did it . Koenig said you managed to hack the NSA . Yeah , it looks that way . Where 'd he go ? He 's sending everything over to NATO , CIA , INTERPOL . Guess he hopes they 'll take it as a sign of good faith from S.H.I.E.L.D. Smart . Though , looks like all I got was lots of views of an empty rooftop . May 's gone . What do you mean gone ? Gone where ? She left . I 'm sure If I asked where , she wouldn 't have told me . WOW . So no goodbye , no nothing ? She never felt anything for us , did she ? She just played us so she could keep an eye on Coulson . That was her mission . Did you feel anything for her ? Um , no . The only comfort we took in each other was knowing we didn 't have to . - You can 't choose to feel . - Usually I can . It 's different with us . " Us " is a strong word . I mean , I know I kissed you , but , to be fair , I thought there was a 97 % chance we were gonna die . - But we didn 't die . - Which is good . Yes . That is very good . But there 's still no rush on us being an " us . " It 's not like it 's a good time to start anything . There 's never a good time . We 've gotta start somewhere . You better get going . Daniels will be here soon . It 's okay . You 'll be fine . Why don 't you tell her the truth ? That you 're still alive ? Sorry , it 's just the way she talks about you sounds like you two had something nice . We did . So it 's not because you 're afraid to talk to her ? I don 't wanna hurt her again . Besides , it 's not like I can stay . We have a job to do . Yes . If that 's how you felt , you had a funny way to show it . Specialists don 't spend time with a lot of people . The ones we do , we 're all cut from the same cloth . Black Kevlar ? Trained to get the job done . Keep emotions in check . You ? You 're different . Different bad ? Bad for me . I didn 't wanna think about you . I wanted to stay focused . And then I saw you , after you were shot . Fighting to stay alive . But you 're right . I 'm Kevlar . You 're not . You don 't have to be . You don 't have to shut people out . Yeah , I do . There are things about me that you wouldn 't like if you knew . You think I don 't have skeletons ? It 's different . You 're ... Good . So are you . Not always . I lied to you . My older brother , he didn 't beat up my younger brother . He was crueler than that . He made me do it . And I let him . I was afraid of him . What about your parents ? They were worse . I am not a good man , Skye . Yes , you are . Mmm . One of my cuts must 've just opened up . - Let me help . Let me help . - No , no , no , no . I just need to clean up . There you are , Eric . No . Keep playing - I 'm sorry I scare you . I know that I 'm a monster . But you 're the one that can save me . Come on . Eric ? That 's weird . Eric ? Eric ? Ward . Aah ! Jemma ! No . Please . No , no . No . No . No . Skye ? Skye ? He 's HYDRA . Okay . Okay . Okay . Skye ? Oh . You 're safe . I 'm still here . I promise . I 'm still here with you . Phil . Are you okay ? I thought he was here . It seemed so real this time . See what we wanna see , I guess . I guess so . Hey . Think I 'd be hiding in a closet ? I was wondering where you went . I went back to the room , you weren 't there . Why 'd you leave ? - Truth ? - I 'd appreciate it . You scared me . Opening up . That kiss . Which was a very nice kiss , I admit . I didn 't mean to scare you . I don 't exactly over-analyze . I just act impulsively and then I freak out after the fact . Are you still ? No . I 'm good . I want this . And you ? What do you want ? What I want is to stay here with you , and imagine the world outside doesn 't exist . But the world outside does exist . I just got word from Fitz . They need our help . Bus is fueled up , ready to go . We should tell Koenig . I just did . He 's headed outside to open the hangar doors . We 're in a hurry . - I just gotta grab a couple of things . - Hey . We need to go right now . Of course we do . Lead the way . Sir ? Is everything okay ? She said I never lied to her . Today , I did . But she 's alive . And safe . We did that at least . Why didn 't you tell her the truth ? I will . Someday , I guess . When there 's a chance she 'll understand . When we get back , I need to make things right with May . How can I expect Audrey to forgive me if I 'm not willing to do the same ? I 'm gonna check with Trip . See how much longer we have . - We need to talk . - We do ? Agent Triplett thinks he 's done something to upset you . Fitz , if you 're questioning his loyalty in any way , I can assure you ... It 's not him . What is it then ? You know how I can be . I hate change . Where 's our bus ? And our team ? I don 't know . It 's so beautiful . So , are we off to Portland ? Actually , Fitz thinks the 084 plasma ray we found in Peru might help . Didn 't we jettison that to the sun ? Yeah , but Fitz has the specs on it . - On the hard drive . - Mmm-hmm . You need me to decrypt the hard drive . The team does . And since it 's coupled to specific coordinates , Agent Skye , you 're in charge . Where to next ? What are you doing ? We have to go . 500 miles . What ? 500 miles and I don 't even get a thank you . - I was just about to ... - it 's too late . - Thank you . - I said , too late . You can call anybody you like . Why me ? I needed someone I can trust . That bad , huh ' ? Did you get it ? I may be retired , but I still have contacts . And my agency hasn 't fallen apart . You 're not the only one looking , you know ? She won 't be hard to find . I know . You 're not gonna take her out , are you ? No , Mom . I just wanna talk . Good . I 've always liked Maria .

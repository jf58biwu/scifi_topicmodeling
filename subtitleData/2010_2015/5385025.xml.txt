 Rex , I need an update . I 'm right at the edge . Anything * * * from the sandstorm . Dr. Holiday : It 's not the storm they 're running from . The nanites inside them are forcing the animals away . It 's creating a kind of nanite-free zone . Rex : Ha ! We should call White Knight . Maybe he 'll move here and leave us all alone . Dr. Holiday : It 's no laughing matter , Rex . It could be the most significant development since the original nanite event . Rex : Yeah , yeah . Possible cure , save the world ... Got it . I 'll check it out . Bobo : Hey , doc . You may wanna get a load of this over here . Dr. Holiday : Negative . The storm is moving in too fast . Just place a sensor and pack it in . Rex : Hey ! No . Couldn 't be . Rex to base ... we got trouble of the egomaniacal evo kind . Dr. Holiday : Van Kleiss is here ? Why am I not surprised ? Rex : I think the real question is , if everything else is in such a race to get out , why is he going in ? Dr. Holiday : Rex , wait . Rex : Don 't worry , doc . It 's me . What could possibly happen ? ♪ So make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way ♪ ♪ we 're gonna have fun tonight ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ ♪ so make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ Skalamander : Rargh ! Ptuh ! There 's nothing but dirt ! Biowulf : My sensors ... useless in all this sand . Van Kleiss : This phenomenon deserves my personal attention . What we seek is nearby . I can feel it pushing against me . Rex : Yeah ? Skalamander : [ Grunts ] Rex : How about kicking against you , too ? Van Kleiss : Rex ! You 're not welcome here . Rex : [ Grunts ] [ Groans ] Now , that hurt my feelings ! - [ Groaning ] - Skalamander : [ Laughs ] Rex : Aaah ! Whoa ! Van Kleiss : If I never see your face again , it will be too soon . Rex : Yeah ? The feeling 's ... Whoa ! Mutual ! [ Grunting ] Dr. Holiday : Rex ? Rex , do you read me ? Bobo : [ Coughing ] Okay , we gotta get outta here . I got sand in places I didn 't even know I had places . Dr. Holiday : Rex , if you can hear me , we 're retreating to the safe zone . Rendezvous with us there . Rex : Aaaah ! Whoa-ohhhhhhh ! [ Grunts ] [ Coughs ] Okay , Kleiss ... go time ! No evo allies , just you and ... whoa ! Uh , sorry , buddy . Didn 't mean to bring you along for the ride . Van Kleiss : I don 't need my evo allies , when I can simply make more . Rex : Don 't get me wrong ... I love punching stuff . [ Roars ] Rex : But anything you can do , I can undo better ! [ Roars ] Rex : We can do this all day . Or you can just spill it . [ Grunts ] Why are you causing this nanite-free zone ? Van Kleiss : How convenient it must be to make me the root of all evil . I 'm not causing it . I 've come to discover the source and destroy it . Rex : This could be the cure to nanites . Van Kleiss : And I live off nanites . What Providence calls a cure , I call death . [ Growls ] Rex : Really ? Haven 't we moved past this ? [ Growls ] - [ Growling ] - Van Kleiss : Huh ? [ Grunts ] Rex : That is the funniest thing I have ever seen ! Hang on ... I got to get this on video . Van Kleiss : [ Panting ] Something 's wrong . I should be controlling this creature . Rex : Stinks to be you . [ Roars ] Rex : Huh ? You ruined my shot ! [ Rumbling ] [ Roars ] Van Kleiss : I believe we 've found something more interesting . Rex : You like to point out the obvious , don 't you ? Bobo : Don 't get me wrong ... I love the kid , but if we don 't pull stakes now , we 'll be combing dust outta all sorts of places for years . Dr. Holiday : Too late . Hold on to everything that 's not tied down . This is going to be a bumpy ... Ride . Six : Holiday ? I trust you 're all right ? Dr. Holiday : I 'm fine , Six . But Rex is still out there ... with Van Kleiss . I can 't reach him . Six : We 'll prep a rescue party . Prepare to come aboard . [ Device humming ] Rex : Hey ! Van Kleiss : This is not simply a nanite-free zone . Something is stealing the nanites from our bodies . If we linger here too long , we may both find ourselves defenseless against the other . Rex : Well , then , we 'd better blow this joint . And when I say " we " I mean " me . " Aaaaaaaah ! [ Grunting ] Van Kleiss : If either of us is to escape this place , we will have to work together . Rex : [ Groans ] What exactly are you suggesting ? Van Kleiss : A temporary truce . Rex : An extremely temporary truce . Van Kleiss : We 'll work our way to the center of the nanite storm . Rex : No , we work our way out of the nanite storm and get Providence in here to figure out what 's happening . Van Kleiss : Providence ? They can 't be trusted . Rex : Them ? Didn 't you try to take over New York ? And Europe ? And the world ? Van Kleiss : You need to listen to me , Rex . Without your powers , you 're nothing but a child . Rex : Oh , yeah ? Truce over ! Okay . This is awkward . Hey , is it just me , or are you getting really dusty ? Van Kleiss : It 's happening faster than I thought . Rex : What 's happening faster ? [ Device beeping ] If you know something , you 'd better spit it out , or ... Whoa ! It all looks fossilized . Like it 's made completely out of ... Sand . Van Kleiss : Not only are there no nanites here , this is pure silicone . There are no other elements ... no carbon , calcium , hydrogen . It appears that this zone not only destroys nanites , but is ... Rex : Squeezing the life from the earth . This isn 't sand . This is me ! Rex : [ Whimpering ] Van Kleiss : These glyphs ... there 's something familiar about them . Sumatran ? Mesopotamian ? Rex : Less geeking , more escaping ! Van Kleiss : We need to find the epicenter of this maze . These glyphs may hold the answer . Rex : Only if one says " exit sign " . Van Kleiss : No need to panic , Rex . We have at least 20 minutes before fossilization ... give or take . Rex : " Don 't panic " ... says the guy who used to be dirt . Van Kleiss : [ Grunts ] Rex : We 're turning into walking litter boxes , and you 're checking out caveman graffiti ? No wonder I 'm always kicking your butt . Van Kleiss : You don 't have an investigative bone in your body , do you ? So strongheaded ... just like your mother . No , you don 't like that , do you ... that I know more about you than you do ? Rex : Skip the head games . Isn 't exactly a good time . Van Kleiss : No , but perhaps it is time for some truth . We may perish down here , Rex . Ask me anything you want about the past , and I 'll answer it . Rex : Sell it somewhere else . I 'm not buying . Van Kleiss : Oh , so the great and powerful Providence has finally come through on their promise to help you remember your past . Rex : Something better ... someone who was actually there at the nanite event . Van Kleiss : Aha . Your brother , Caesar . [ Chuckles evilly ] I 've been following you both very closely since his ... Miraculous reappearance . Even if you don 't want to hear what I have to say , this one 's for free . Do not place your trust in Caesar . He 's not the man you believe him to be . Rex : What are you getting at ? Van Kleiss : Oh , no , no . That 's not how this works . It isn 't my turn . Quid pro quo , Rex . If you want to know more ... Why don 't we start with something simple ? Rylander 's Omega nanite . I know it 's inside you . White knight : Status update ? Six : Still no fix on Rex . Scanners can 't cut through the storm . * * * stage a recon . White Knight : I will not risk everyone on board that ship for one agent . Not even that agent . Dr. Holiday : Whoops . Guess the satellite feed went down . Nasty sand . Caesar ? Wanted you to know , we haven 't found him yet . - Found who ? - Dr. Holiday : Rex . Right . Ah . Sorry . That was , uh , 15 minutes ago . I 've done about 500 tasks since then . Try calibrating the keep 's sensors to search for traces of selenium . It 's something Rex naturally gives off , like dandruff . Dr. Holiday : I ... really ? Hmm . Okay , thanks . Van Kleiss : So what you 're saying is , the motor runs off of gravity and the only exhaust are atoms of selenium . Rex : Now you . Squid pro ... Whatever . The nanites , the event . What started all this ? Van Kleiss : He didn 't tell you ? I 'm not surprised . It was Caesar . Rex : [ Grunts ] Van Kleiss : Wasteful , Rex . Rex : You 're lying ! Van Kleiss : Hardly . Your brother is responsible for the most significant catastrophe in human history . You have to admit that as brilliant as Caesar is , he 's ... Not quite right . Am I telling you something that you haven 't already noticed ? Rex : [ Groans ] [ Grunts ] Haaah ! [ Grunts ] Van Kleiss : [ Coughing ] You seem to have awoken some sort of defense mechanism . Rex : What are they defending ? Rocks ? [ Grunts ] Van Kleiss : Before we 're totally devoid of nanites , we need to end this now ... together . Rex : Back to back ! Van Kleiss : What ? Rex : Haven 't you ever read a comic book ? Back to back ! No way . These markings ... they 're not hieroglyphics . They 're circuit boards . This whole cave , this valley ... it 's one giant circuit board . These are data conduits ... M.S. Hubs ! Van Kleiss : You 're right . These spirals are solid-state storage ... the standard design for a firewall in a CPU . Rex : Did you just say I 'm right ? Now that I know what we 're dealing with , it 's a simple matter of ... Hacking in . This is malo ... muy malo . Van Kleiss , meet the psycho computer who calls herself ... Van Kleiss : Zag-RS ? Rex : How do you know that ? Rex : You know Zag-RS ? How ? Van Kleiss : She was designed as a decontamination program at the original nanite laboratory . Her task was to destroy any rogue nanites that escaped from the holding tanks . Rex : She did a great job . Whoever designed her should be taken out and beaten with a tendril . Van Kleiss : Caesar designed her . Rex : I 'm gonna have to have a chat with my brother when this is over . [ Grunting ] Van Kleiss : Focus , you fool . If we 're to survive this , we have to use whatever nanites we have left to shut her down . Rex : [ Groans ] No problemo ! Ah , come on ! Stay up ! Show-off . [ Groans ] Well , this bites . Didn 't I leave you in orbit ? Shouldn 't you have burned up in re-entry or something ? * * * a hard desert landing . This unit faced complete system failure . Salvation came from integration with the host space station power cells , where new initiatives were established . Rex : Turning the world into a sandbox ? Zag-RS : Correct . The prevention of organic infection by elimination of organic matter and securing the earth core system . Soon , this world will function without flaw . Rex : Van Kleiss ! Change of plan ! While I 've got Zaggy occupied , you go and warn Providence before it 's too late ! Van Kleiss : There 's no time . Her strength is growing exponentially . To achieve victory , you must trust me . Rex : Trust you ? ! That 's comedy gold ! Even if I was that big of a doof , neither one of us has enough power to fight back ! Van Kleiss : That 's not entirely true . Rex : Huh ? Van Kleiss : I 've not been completely honest with you . Rex : Stunned ... really . Van Kleiss : The Omega nanite within you has a self-replicating program . You can create your own nanites . Rex : What ? ! Why didn 't you tell me ! Van Kleiss : A calculated omission . Rex : [ Grunts ] No way . Van Kleiss : There ... that is the heart of Zag-RS . Strike while you can ! Rex : Oh , yeah ! Now we 're talking ! Normally , I don 't fight girls , but this time , I 'll make ... A big ... Giant ... Robot ... Exception ! Dr. Holiday : I found him , Six ... 20 kilometers northeast . There 's a huge spike in trace selenium . Six : Charge all weapons . Dr. Holiday : The storm 's starting to break . But please don 't crash . Rex : Yaaah ! [ Grunts ] That 's not fair ! It worked in the movie ! [ Whimpers ] [ Groaning ] Aaah ! Zag-RS : You have miscalculated , human . The more nanites you replicate , the more energy you supply me . 7.5 seconds until I overtake your production . Van Kleiss : [ Grunts ] Zag-RS : 4.3 seconds . Van Kleiss : Aaaaaaaaah ! Rex : Yaaaaaah ! One psycho robot down , one supervillain to ... chicken ! Finally ! Bobo : What , you never heard the term " fashionably late " ? [ Device beeps ] Dr. Holiday : Your nanite-replicating function seems to be working well . Most of Zag-RS ' alterations have been expunged . Rex : Meaning ... What ? Bobo : You ain 't gonna wash away at high tide . This is my design . Rex : Great ... my brother created Zag-RS . Evidently . Though her evolution into some sort of sentient nanite-slayer is most curious . Six : Curious ? Rex : What about what Van Kleiss said ? You mean I 'm to blame for the original nanite event ? Why don 't we ask her ? Wait ! Interface protocols . Code designate Zag-RS . Respond . Zag-RS : Dr. Salazar . Good morning . How may I assist you ? Dr. Holiday : Stand down , gentlemen . Zag-RS has been successfully rebooted . But her memory has been wiped clean . Rex : What ? You got to be kidding me ! That 's interesting . Hmm . Van Kleiss must have implemented a program dump before he left you . It 's the only logical conclusion . Rex : Program dump ? Van Kleiss : Do not place your trust in Caesar . He 's not the man you believe him to be . Rex : Great . So now all we 've got is a lame decontamination program with a GPS lady 's voice ? GPS lady ? Hardly . - Rex : I was making a joke . - Don 't you recognize it ? When I programmed her , I wanted a voice that meant safety ... Protection ... Caring . Rex , this is our mother 's voice .

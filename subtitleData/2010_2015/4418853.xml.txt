 Resync by : Chubby1976 for R5-MiSTERE version of Ganool MKV Release I remembered a joke . It 's funny . when their young son suddenly enters the room . Hang on a sec . We are going in the right direction ? Olav ! What are we looking for ? Just keep going . A little bit more or else we will be flagged on the site . Okay . Continue the joke . crying . what should we do ? You know women ... The father says : " Let me handle this . Then he leaves and goes to the child 's bedroom to say he was joking . He opens the door and sees the small bastard having sex with her ! up and down . Then he looks for the father and says : Dad ? right ? Stop ! Is it here ? It 's right here . Don 't move ! Turn on the light . Good God ! Kate ! Kate . These fellas said that you 've been expecting them ? Hanks . - Thanks . didn 't you ? I just- - Yeah . this is him . I 'm Dr. Sander Halvorson . Kate Lloyd . Yes . Do you know who I am ? I do . Adam told me a little bit about you as well . He said you specialized in vertebrate paleontology . yes . And obviously you extracted specimens from pack ice . I 've worked on several cold weather digs . Good . runs a geological research station in Antarctica . his team found something quite remarkable . Really ? What 'd they find ? We 're flying down there tommorow evening to examine the site . And I need a paleontologist . I 'm sure you can understand that I need to know a little bit about what it is I 'm being asked to dig up ? There is a structure . A structure ? - Yes . - In Antarctica ? And a specimen . That 's all I can tell you . And I guess I don 't have any time to think about this . I 'm sorry . I need your answer right now . Well ... I 'm in . Great . Adam will get you the details of our departure . of course . Thank you . Adam . What the hell is it ? You now officially know as much as I do . I worked for that guy for three years and I 've never seen him this excited . She US ? Look at this guy . how is that even humanly possible ? I was hoping maybe you could help me with something ? I can 't seem to get ahold of a newspaper three weeks old and I 'm a man in desperate need for certain information . man . And what information would that be ? I want to know how the Cavaliers are going . I don 't follow football . It 's a basketball team . They play basketball . man . that 's all right . you might wanna wrap it up in a couple of days . why 's that ? There 's a storm moving in . A nasty one . he 's right . And the last place where you want to be is cooped up with a dozen Norwegian guys . Trust me . Base in sight of my 1 o 'clock . This is H3 Sea King inbound to Thule . Do you copy ? approach from the west . Landing pad is cleared coming back . Griggs . - Dr. Halvorson ? - Yes ? - Welcome to Thule . - Thank you . right now . Lars is going to drive you . - Hi . - Hi . Welcome . - Please go in the Spryte . - Thanks . sir . Watch your step . Brighten . Edvard ! I did . this is Kate Lloyd . - Columbia paleontology . - Welcome . my research assistant . - Welcome . - Hi . my good friend . This is some of my team . Karl and Juliette . Both geologists . - Hi . - Welcome . Okay . 000 miles . Holy shit ! 000 years . We picked up a signal transmitting . perhaps . Incredible . We think the signal was triggered when the survivor exited the craft . Survivor ? My God . Kate ? I 'd say ... maybe half a day . Good . should I ask you how fragile is it ? It 's not in a fracture zone . So there 's very little risk of fissuring . And the ice is quite dense . So we think we can get it out in one piece . Good . 3 and a half feet high . - Probably some place right around- - - That 's great ... Make sure that everyone stays off the radio . I do not want any information out . And the crane ... do we have something appropriate for this ? it 's already there . It 's all set up . by the way . - Peder . - Nice to meet you . you 've gotten it all taken care of . I don 't think you really need me . What about him ? He 's secretly disinterested or- - ? that 's Lars . but he works like a bear . the ship carved a 200m tunnel into the ice . let me get this right . You crashed into a glacier ... And then without enough information you leave the cozy confines of your ship ? Maybe he was hurt and wanted to find someplace warm . I guess it didn 't find it . The first night is hard . it 's fine . I 'll never look at them the same again . What do you mean for transport weight ? we have to take it from here to here . Start with 4 inches . I never believed in this shit . I always did . - We 're all set ? - Nearly there . Good . Good . I 'm going to take a tissue sample . Do you really that 's a good idea ? I do . I mean the conditions are so unpredictable and we don 't have the proper equipment . Sterilization is an issue . what do you have in the way of a small diameter drill ? Up to 30mm . Very good . I think somewhere around here . Kate . Just a second . don 't contradict me in front of those people again . - I just thought ... - You 're not here to think . You 're here to get that thing safe out of the ice . I hope we understand each other . have you ever tasted this before ? I haven 't . - It tastes very bad . Gentlemen . Ladies . After a short but thorough investigation like what we have in that other room . the impact of this find will be felt for thousands of years . the world as we know it has forever been altered . as the people who made this discovery . Thank you . Do you think they 're going to pay a bonus for bringing over an alien instead of coal samples ? You 've got anything better than this cough syrup ? Griggy . - Yeah ? You want to go out and get the cabinet stash ? no problem . I 'm on it . Where did I put this bottle ? Jesus Ch ... man . Son of a ... It broke out ! What ? man ! The freaking thing 's alive ! looking at the ice then the freaking thing jumped out ! We search in groups of two and three . don 't attempt anything on your own . And be careful ... We don 't know what condition it 's in . did you leave that open ? - I don 't remember . - Shit . man . That thing jumped through the fucking roof . Jesus Christ . Help ! Over here ! Help ! Somebody ! Over here ! - It attacked Henrik . - Come on . - Jesus ! - In there ! somebody do something ! - Oh my God . man ! man ! Burn it ! throw it ! His blood pressure 's low . Henrik and ... his small children . it 's horrible . It 's a horrible tragedy . We 're all shocked . At what happened to Henrik . we need to examine the remains before it all disintegrates . I 'm talking about the creature . And I 'm sure we 're all aware of the importance of this discovery . This may be the first and only time mankind has been visited by an alien lifeform . did it ? I think you should destroy it . Completely . really ? he 's in bad shape . we 're going to fly him back to McMurdo at sun-up and take him to the military hospital . hmm ? as crazy as it sounds . Kate ? Can you help here ? Come on . Pull that side up . His face is encased in some type of amniotic sac . The tissue . Looks almost new . What was it doing to him ? It appears that it was absorbing him . Some type of digestion . It 's fascinating . It is fascinating . - What 's the matter ? Are you okay ? - I 'm fine . I 'm okay . no . I 'm okay . What is this ? Looks like a titanium plate . Used to reinforce bones and compound fractures . that 's right . Henrik broke his arm last year . He had to go to Argentina to get it set . what 's it doing out of him now ? That 's a good question . What are you doing ? Took a sample of Henrik 's tissue . I want to find out what this thing was doing to him . I think you should take a look at this . These cells aren 't dead . That 's not possible . Looks like the alien cells are somehow attacking Henrik 's cells and then they- - What is that ? It looks like they are transforming ... They 're imitating his cells . but ... They 're imitating him . Olav . A doctor will see you in McMurdo . Kate . - Hey . - Hi . We 're leaving . we 'll be back with help as soon as we can . Okay . Alright . - Keep him warm . - I will . let 's go . Sit down there . There you go . let 's get the hell out of here . wait ! She 's flagging us down . - What 's wrong ? - They shouldn 't leave . Carter . man . we 're landing . Shit . Let 's take her down . Is there something wrong ? everything 's fine . Probably just forgot something . okay ? Don 't worry . Hang in there . Something 's wrong . or any ears on the emergency channel . Do you copy ? Over . this is Thule Station . right behind this ridgeline . It 's impossible to reach them . This doesn 't make any sense . right ? We 're not going after them ? Shouldn 't we try ? We need a chopper to even get close to them . And there 's refueling and hailing . All this can 't be a coincidence . Radio 's dead . It 's fucking dead . The incoming storm . Fuck . There 's too much interference . We have four missing persons . We have no helicopter or radio . You made a mistake for bringing these people here . More people may die . we don 't know even if they are dead or not . get your gear . We 'll take a snowcat to the next base . do it now . I don 't think that 's a good idea . And why is that ? Because no one can leave this camp ... until we know more about what 's going on here . but ... Why did you flag down that helicopter ? Because I thought it was in danger . Why ? I took a sample of Henrik 's blood ... and I saw that the alien cells were still alive . They were alive and they were copying Henrik 's cells . Replicating them . Adam saw it too . Is that true ? I don 't know . I don 't know what we saw . we saw something . I don 't understand . What are you saying ? replicated a person . - What ? - That can 't be . - Who ? - This is insane . Okay . Kate ? Kate ? Okay ! Kate . This is not the time to be yelling fire . and discuss this in private . Doctor . We all want the fucking information ! There 's more . What are those ? I think they are fillings from someone 's teeth . I found them by a puddle of blood in the shower . Puddle of blood ? but not inorganic material . so it spit them out . - We 're wasting too much time already . Lars ? - Listen ! someone had cleaned up the blood . Someone had wiped it away . so whatever it is ... It is still here . I 've heard enough . get the gear . Ten minutes . Edvard . You can 't leave . You can 't leave ! You don 't know what we 're dealing with . Well done . Kate ? I don 't know if I should be speaking about this . I don 't want to get anyone in trouble . Speaking about what ? You were saying ... about someone cleaning up the blood from the shower . please ... What did you see ? I think ... I saw Colin coming from the showers . He was holding something . something to clean up . but it 's just that I s- - He 's leaving with Edvard . We can 't let them go . We can 't let any of them go . I know where they keep the keys for the vehicles . - Where are they ? - In that drawer . - This one ? - Yes . - How many am I looking for ? - Five . Three and four . You said there were five ? Run ! what happened ? Karl . It got Karl . It got ... Karl . Kate . Burn it ! that 's enough . Burn in hell . What the fuck 's happening to us ? copies it perfectly ... and then hides inside it . Waiting . Is it still among us ? It could be any of us . We got to get out of here . right now . And it could be getting a vehicle with it . You 'll be alone . Vulnerable . That 's exactly what it wants . Not to mention you 'll be giving it a way out of here . A way to spread . It 's like a virus . So what do we do with any virus ? Quarantine . We isolate it and then we kill it . Yeah . We have to rely on science . Exposing our uncontaminated blood to the cells of the creature might create a reaction ... of some kind . So we take blood samples from everybody . and we test each one of them . Adam and I can do that . Okay . Lars and I 'll disable the vehicles . We have to trust in this plan . It 's our only chance of making it through this . - Is that it ? - Yes . - No more vehicles ? - Only these . Okay . What ? Grenades . Is everything alright ? everything 's fine . Good . you 're okay ? - Yes . we should go . The storm is getting worse . Who is that ? Hurry up . They 're coming . The Americans . It is impossible for a human to survive in that crash . right now . - Let 's finish them off ! - Peder ? It could be murder . but we don 't have to kill them . Right ? We can just lock them up ... until the Sander 's test is ready . Please . Please . So this is a good idea ? Locking us up ? You need our help . Warn your scientists they can 't handle with what we saw in that chopper . you could be one of those things . It is pretty hard to believe you both walked away from that crash . but ... - We 're preparing a test . And then we figure out who 's who . It 's all I can offer you right now . Damn ! There 's a fire here ! Someone sabotaged it . There 's nothing left . Nothing . Now there 's no test . How could this happen ? It was no accident . You . You were in there with him . You were the last one . - How are you accusing me ? - Why not ? an asshole ? I was the one working on the test . I left for 2 minutes ! do ya ? - Bullshit ! This is a goddamn fucking nightmare ! There might be another way . I think there might be another way to tell . give me your flashlight . Now tell Lars to open his mouth . Tell him to open his mouth . Open your mouth . Good . Lars has fillings . So he 's human . It can 't imitate inorganic material . See ? Yes . Good . Good . Open . Come on ! You 're next ! Open your mouth ! Okay . Good . it 's at least something . A way to eliminate some of us . So I 'm gonna get killed because I floss ? Nobody 's getting killed . Kate ? come on . Kate . Just do it . Kate . Open . Just go stand over there . there are too many variables . Open your mouth . Open your mouth ! They are porcelain . Go stand with Adam . Anyone else with porcelain fillings ? Or clean teeth ? It 's bloody absurd . This is wrong . you and Lars go out . we 'll check them too . But why don 't we just leave them where they are ? They can 't do anything . We need to know . - What ? - She wants us to find the Americans . then . Come on ! She is smart . Yes . She is in control now . Shit . They escaped . Lars . Let 's go back inside . No . We have to find them . be careful . They are not human ! Lars ! Lars ! Lars ! Lars . Wait . Lars . Peder . Stay calm ! The threat isn 't here . It 's out there . The Americans are the real enemy . Peder . it doesn 't matter . You can 't trust them . Watch them . Kate ! Come on ! Come on ! Where are they ? - Where are the rest ? - They attacked them . - Who ? - They got Lars ! - Peder ! - They took Lars ! keep them back . Peder . they took Lars . - The enemy is out there . - We don 't know if we can trust them ! don 't listen to them . Peder ! They 're inside . Where is Lars ? Calm down ! I said calm down ! - Where the fuck is Lars ? - Drop it ! don 't listen to them . - Put it down ! - They killed Lars ! Lars is killed . Burn them ! Burn them ! Peder ? Peder ? Okay ! okay ? It 's okay . He was going to fire . - It 's going to catch fire ! It will explode ! - Come on ! Let 's go ! Edvard ? Edvard ? - Pick him up . - Okay . You . you . Help him ! show yourselves ! Right fucking now ! Everybody in the rec room . come on . Sit down . Not all of us are human . Just put him over there on the couch . Help ! Help me ! My God ! Get it off him ! man ? Carter ! man ! There is something wrong with it ! Hold on ! burn it ! Look out ! Adam ! take it ! Carter ! There is something wrong with the pressure . Put some air in the pipe . Watch out ! Carter ! We gotta get the air up . No . God ! Carter ! No ! No ! buddy . Carter . You 're okay ? Yeah . And you ? no . We find it and then we kill it . I think that was Sander . Yeah . - Shit ! - God ! Watch out ! do you see it ? Where did it go ? There ! Get back ! Don 't . Don 't touch it . Do you hear that ? Yeah . Kate ! - Sander . - Wait . So what ? He 'll freeze out there . And if he doesn 't ? If it makes it out of here ... millions of people could die . it does . Alright . What ? What happened to Lars ? We didn 't kill him . Come on . run ! Kate ! Kate ! Kate ! Kate ? Kate ? Kate ! So what we do now ? There 's a Russian station ... about 50 miles from here . Should have enough gas . okay ? Okay . Let 's go . I 'm going to put this in the back . You know how I knew you were human ... when you showed up back at base ? No . Your earring . It was on your other ear . Kate ? what are you doing ? Let 's talk about it . Talk to me . Kate ? Kate ! Kate ! No ! Oh my God . can anybody hear me ? Edvard ? it 's Matias . It 's Matias ! - Open your mouth . - What ? Matias . now ! get it up ! Now ! Come on !

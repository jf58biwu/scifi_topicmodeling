 [ cars rushing by ] [ suspenseful music ] ♪ [ audience chatter ] [ applause ] - [ low ] I 'D LIKE TO FIRST WELCOME EVERYONE HERE TONIGHT . ALL OF YOU JOINING US- - ( man ) WE CAN 'T HEAR YOU ! [ mic feedback ] - [ amplified ] OKAY , I 'M SORRY . PLEASE EXCUSE US FOR A MOMENT . WE 'RE CLEARLY HAVING SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES HERE . UH , WE 'LL INTRODUCE THIS EVENING 'S KEYNOTE SPEAKER IN JUST A SECOND . [ audience chattering ] [ clock ticking ] [ water cooler humming ] [ train rushes by ] - [ sighs ] [ shoe creaks ] [ ticking loudly ] [ water trickling ] [ ringtone jingling ] - NO CELL PHONES . - I KNOW . [ ringtone stops ] - THE BATTERY . - [ scoffs ] [ phone ringing ] - YES . YES . UNDERSTOOD . - WAS THAT HIM ? WHAT DID HE SAY ? - 40 MINUTES . - THIS DOESN 'T FEEL RIGHT . THIS IS OVER TWO YEARS . DID HE SAY WHY ? - TRAFFIC . PERHAPS WE SHOULD DISCUSS THE ADDENDUM BEFORE HE ARRIVES . I WASN 'T 100 % CLEAR- - - IT WAS STRONGLY SUGGESTED . - IT WASN 'T 100 % CLEAR IF THIS WAS APPLICABLE . IT CERTAINLY WASN 'T AT THE START . AND , NOW THAT WE 'RE HERE ... - IT WAS STRONGLY SUGGESTED . AND NOW THAT WE 'RE SOMEHOW HERE , IT WOULD SEEM IRRESPONSIBLE TO EVERYONE INVOLVED TO NOT HAVE THE DISCUSSION . - RIGHT , THAT 'S ... EXACTLY WHAT I 'M SAYING . - WHO 'S THE AUTHOR OF THE ADDENDUM ? - I IMAGINE IT WAS A COMPOSITOR . - RIGHT , SO ... - WASN 'T ME . - OR ME . - I 'M SORRY ? - THE ADDENDUM . - WHAT ABOUT IT ? - WE THINK IT SHOULD BE DISCUSSED . - SO ? DISCUSS IT . - WHY WAS IT INCLUDED ? - I WAS ASKED TO INCLUDE APPLIED SUPPOSITIONS . - WHEN ? - NINE MONTHS AGO . WHY AM I BEING INTERROGATED ? - COME ON . IT WAS ALWAYS AGREED ON , FROM THE START , THAT EVERYTHING IN THE FINAL REPORT WOULD BE DISCUSSED AND AGREED UPON BY ALL OF US , UNANIMOUSLY . - THAT 'S RIGHT . - [ chuckles ] WELL ... AS--AS I WAS SAYING- - - WAS IT VON NEU- - I 'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT . WAS IT VON NEUMANN WHO SAID THAT IN MATHEMATICS WE DON 'T UNDERSTAND THINGS , WE SIMPLY GET USED TO THEM ? - WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ? - WELL , UH ... I SUPPOSE WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT THE IMPLICATION STATED WITHIN THE ADDENDUM SEEMED TO BE A SLIGHT STRETCH FOR AN ALGORITHMIC THEORETICIAN , WOULDN 'T YOU SAY , JIM ? - I CAN 'T BELIEVE THE ENGLISH STILL HAVEN 'T TAUGHT YOU PROPER MANNERS . - GUYS , LET 'S STAY ON THE TOPIC . - I 'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHAT THAT MEANS , BUT , UH ... - OH , I 'M SURE YOU WOULDN 'T . - IT 'S APPARENT , HOWEVER SUPERFICIALLY , THAT YOU 'VE EXCEEDED YOUR AUTHORITY . - PERHAPS WE SHOULD HANG ON FOR A MINUTE- - - THIS IS NOT A DEMOCRACY ... - ACTUALLY , AUTHORITY 'S EVEN THE WRONG WORD , BECAUSE THAT HAS IMPLICATIONS , AND IN THIS CASE , THERE ARE NONE . YOU HAD NONE . - OR A LECTURE HALL , SON . - THERE 'S NO POINT IN QUESTIONING- - - I 'M NOT A CHILD . - NO , YOU MOST CERTAINLY ARE NOT . YOU USED THE WORD " SUPERFICIAL " A MOMENT AGO , AND IF THAT 'S WHERE YOU 'D LIKE TO LEAVE IT , THEN THE ANSWER IS QUITE SIMPLE . THREE WORDS : KNOWLEDGE IS POWER . - YES , IT IS . - HIS BRIEF CAREER HAS UNDOUBTEDLY TOUCHED , INFLUENCED , AND MOTIVATED ALL OF US IN SOME CAPACITY . AND THESE BRIEF INTRODUCTIONS ALWAYS , ON SOME LEVEL , SEEM TO FALL SHORT OF TRUE JUSTICE . BUT , NEVERTHELESS , HERE GOES . OUR HONORED GUEST WAS BORN IN PHILADELPHIA , PENNSYLVANIA , SON OF A BANKER AND A HOMEMAKER , A GRADUATE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA , SUMMA CUM LAUDE , BEFORE RECEIVING HIS PhD IN MATHEMATICS FROM PRINCETON . BASED ON HIS THESIS WORK ON RIEMANN 'S HYPOTHESIS , HE WAS AN INVITED FELLOW AT THE INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY AS WELL AS AT MIT , WHERE HIS WORK ON COMPLEXITY THEORY EARNED HIM THE ABEL PRIZE . HE IS PRESENTLY THE ROUSE BALL PROFESSOR OF MATHEMATICS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PURE MATHEMATICS AND MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY AND A FELLOW AT TRINITY COLLEGE . IN 2008 ... HE WAS AWARDED THE GREATEST HONOR IN OUR PROFESSION WHEN HE WAS PRESENTED WITH THE FIELDS MEDAL FOR HIS PROOF OF THE NONEXISTENCE OF ONE-WAY FUNCTIONS . LADIES AND GENTLEMEN , IT IS WITH GREAT HONOR THAT I NOW PRESENT TO YOU DR. TIMOTHY HORTON . [ applause ] [ cheers and applause ] - HAS HE SEEN THIS ? - WHICH PART ? - THE ADDENDUM . - NO . WHAT DOES IT MATTER ? - THE IMPLICATIONS ARE FAIRLY SELF-EVIDENT , RIGHT ? I MEAN , PERHAPS NOT THROUGH AND THROUGH , BUT LET 'S BE CLEAR . THIS ENDEAVOR WOULD NOT HAVE RECEIVED THE LEVEL OF FUNDING AND CLASSIFICATION IF ITS IMPLICATIONS WERE NOT SELF-EVIDENT . - I AGREE THEY 'RE SELF-EVIDENT , BUT I STILL FEEL THEY NEED TO BE AIRED , AND I GUESS , MULLED OVER . I DON 'T KNOW , I FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE TO JUST SIT HERE WITH ASSUMPTIONS . WE ALL KNOW THIS IS FAR TOO BIG TO ASSUME ANYTHING . - WHY IS IT SELF-EVIDENT ? - PARDON ME ? - WHY IS IT SELF-EVIDENT ? - WELL , I MEAN ... YOU DON 'T WORK YOUR ENTIRE ACADEMIC LIFE IN THE FIELDS OF THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE AND COMPLEXITY THEORY WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE- - THE MASSIVE IMPLICATIONS OF DOING SOMETHING LIKE THIS . - RIGHT . WELL , I GUESS , UH , I GUESS I FEEL THERE ARE TWO THINGS WRONG WITH WHAT YOU JUST SAID . UM , FIRST OF ALL , WE WERE TOLD FROM--PROMISED , ACTUALLY , THAT ANY OF THE APPLIED MATHEMATICAL RESULTS OF OUR FINDINGS WOULD BE OUR OWN AND THEY WOULD NOT BE CLASSIFIED . THEY 'D BE GOVERNMENT PURPOSE RIGHTS , BUT THAT 'S IT , RIGHT ? HE CHANGED THAT SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY . SECOND OF ALL , TO ASSUME THAT ANY OF US AS MATHEMATICIANS CAN SUFFICIENTLY GAUGE THE REAL-WORLD IMPLICATIONS OF THIS PROJECT , IT 'S- - [ chuckles ] IT 'S HUBRIS . I MEAN , IT 'S--IT 'S- - IT 'S JUST HUBRIS . - WOW . HOW DO YOU EVER GET A DATE WITH SUCH AN ACADEMIC MIND ? - I 'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU 'RE SUGGESTING . - I SIMPLY DAZZLE THEM WITH MY CARD TRICKS . I MEAN , COME ON , GUYS , THIS IS ... I FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE ARGUMENT THAT EVOLUTIONARY SCIENTISTS HAVE OVER STEAK DINNER AND A GLASS OF WINE , RIGHT ? IT 'S--ONE SOLVES ONE PROBLEM , AND THE OTHER ONE LOOKS BACK AND SAYS , " WELL , WHAT WAS BEFORE THAT ? " AND THEN , " WELL , WHAT WAS BEFORE THAT ? WHAT WAS BEFORE THAT ? " I MEAN ... HOW DO WE GET OUR MINDS AROUND SOMETHING LIKE THAT ? - WHY DON 'T YOU READ MY ADDENDUM ? - I DID , AND I FIND YOUR ASSUMPTIONS TO BE INADEQUATE , AMONG OTHER THINGS . - I DON 'T THINK ANYONE IS SAYING HERE THAT WE CAN ACCURATELY FORECAST THE IMPLICATIONS OF OUR RESEARCH 50 YEARS FROM NOW , IF I CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU 'RE TRYING TO SAY . JUST LIKE OPPENHEIMER AND FERMI COULDN 'T POSSIBLY PREDICT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE LOS ALAMOS RESEARCH . - THIS ALSO BEGS THE QUESTION OF RESPONSIBILITY AS WELL . - HOW COULD WE POSSIBLY DISCUSS THAT ? - AT LOS ALAMOS , THEY DIDN 'T- - - THIS ... IS NOT LOS ALAMOS . - WHAT DID YOU SAY ? - HOW 'S YOUR DAUGHTER DOING ? SHE TALKING YET ? - AS MUCH AS I DO APPRECIATE THE SMALLTALK , HORTON , IT FEELS AWKWARDLY OUT OF PLACE GIVEN YOUR LITTLE LOS ALAMOS PROJECT . - MANHATTAN . - WHAT 'S THAT ? - FREAKIN ' BRITS . IT WAS THE MANHATTAN PROJECT . - RIGHT . - YEAH , YEAH , THIS IS ALL S.C.I. CLASSIFIED . SO , YOU KNOW , IF YOU DIVULGE ANYTHING , THE NSA- - I THINK THAT 'S WHO WE 'VE GOT OVER THERE- - THEY 'LL , UH , THEY 'LL ASSASSINATE YOU . PROBABLY TORTURE YOU FIRST . - OH , VERY CHARMING . GUESS I SHOULD PUT AWAY MY SPY CAMERA THEN . - [ chuckles ] " BUT , UH , BUT , " MR. PRESIDENT , HE 'LL SEE EVERYTHING . HE 'LL SEE THE BIG BOARD ! " - PRECISELY THE IDEA . WHERE THE BLOODY HELL IS LOS ALAMOS , ANYWAY ? - AH , IT 'S NEW MEXICO . THE DESERT . - HMM . WHAT 'S IT LIKE TO LIVE IN THE DESERT ? I DO WONDER . - HOW SHOULD I KNOW ? I 'M FROM SOUTH PHILLY . - EITHER WAY , THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT LOS ALAMOS . - WAIT , WHAT 'D YOU SAY ? - HMM ? WHAT , " THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT LOS- - " - NO , NO , NO . BEFORE THAT . - OH . I DO WONDER WHAT IT 'S LIKE TO , YOU KNOW , LIVE IN A- - - RIGHT , RIGHT . LIVE IN A DESERT . HUGH , WHAT ARE SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF A DESERT ? - IT 'S HOT . - RIGHT , YEAH , AND WHAT ELSE ? - NO WATER . NO RAIN . CACTUSES OR--CACTUS . CACTI . - SAND . - SURE . - MILLIONS OF GRAINS OF SAND . WHAT IF I , UH , I TOOK SOMETHING , LIKE A-A QUID COIN , OKAY ? AND I BURIED IT IN THE SAND . IT 'S BURIED , YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHERE IT IS , AND I ASK YOU TO FIND IT . HOW LONG WOULD THAT TAKE YOU ? - [ scoffs ] WELL- - - YEARS , RIGHT ? I MEAN , MILLIONS OF YEARS , IF THE DESERT WERE BIG ENOUGH . - SURE . - WHAT IF I MELTED THE SAND ? TOOK ALL THE SAND IN THE DESERT AND MELTED IT . GLASS . THE WHOLE DESERT BECOMES ONE BIG SHEET OF GLASS . SO NOW , FINDING THE COIN IS EASY , RIGHT ? YOU JUST- - YOU SEE IT FLOATING THERE . CHANGE THE SAND TO GLASS , AND FINDING THE COIN IS TRIVIAL . HUGH , I THINK YOU 'RE GONNA NEED TO LEAVE NOW . - OH , YES . - NO , SERIOUSLY , I THINK YOU REALLY NEED TO LEAVE . - WHAT DO YOU THINK ? WHAT DO YOU THINK ? - I 'M SORRY ? - COME ON . - OH , I , UH , THINK WE SHOULD WAIT FOR HIM TO ARRIVE BEFORE THAT 'S DISCUSSED . - PERHAPS A CONSENSUS AMONGST US WOULD BE HELPFUL WHEN HE DOES ARRIVE . - WELL , I THINK IT 'S FAIRLY CLEAR WHAT HE 'LL SAY OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS : NOTHING . OUR TALENTS WERE USED ON THE CHALKBOARDS IN THE CLASSROOMS , AND ULTIMATELY COMPOSED HERE . AND THAT MAY BE WHERE THEY 'D LIKE TO LEAVE THINGS , BUT IF HISTORY HAS AN PRECEDENT , WE 'RE AT THE FOREFRONT OF A NEW TECHNOCRATIC REALITY . JUST LIKE OPPENHEIMER . WE REALLY SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT MATHEMATICIANS AS POLITICIANS . - BUT THOSE GUYS HAD NO PRECEDENT . AND , QUITE FRANKLY , AFTER SEEING WHAT OPPENHEIMER ENDURED AFTER TRINITY , I 'M NOT SURE ANY OF US IS PREPARED FOR THAT . - REGARDLESS , IT 'S REALITY . WE 'VE ALL THOUGHT ABOUT IT , I MEAN- - - I 'M GONNA SAY THAT I OBJECT TO THESE COMPARISONS . - WHY ? - IT 'S JUST UNCOMFORTABLE . - I UNDERSTAND THAT , BUT WHY ? - PERHAPS IT 'S HEARTBURN , BUT WHO KNOWS ? - [ scoffs ] COME ON . - BECAUSE , AT THE PENULTIMATE ACHIEVEMENT OF HIS CAREER , THE ONLY THING OPPENHEIMER COULD REMEMBER WAS THE BHAGAVAD GITA : " NOW I AM BECOME DEATH , THE DESTROYER OF WORLDS . " - I DON 'T KNOW WHO 'S MORE NAIVE- - THE ONE WHO BELIEVES IGNORING THE PROBLEM IS RIGHTEOUS , OR THE ONE WHO BELIEVES THIS DISCOVERY IS EQUIVALENT TO THE ATOMIC BOMB . - I THINK YOU MISS MY POINT . - WHEREAS THEIR WORK WAS BUILT AROUND THREAT , FEAR , AND ULTIMATELY DESTRUCTION . HER WORK WAS ONE OF DISCOVERY AND KNOWLEDGE--THAT 'S IT . - YOU CAN 'T OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT THEIR RESEARCH BLAZED THE WAY FOR NUMEROUS SCIENTIFIC AND MEDICAL ACHIEVEMENTS THAT HAVE SAVED COUNTLESS LIVES ... - I UNDERSTAND THAT . - AND FACILITATED THE GROWTH OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AS WE KNOW IT . NUCLEAR POWER PROVIDES 20 % OF THE U.S. ' S AND 30 % OF THE EU 'S ELECTRICAL POWER . - I UNDERSTAND THAT , BUT THE AIMS OF THEIR PROJECT- - THEY KNEW WHAT THEIR OBJECTIVE WAS . IT WAS DESTRUCTIVE . I MEAN , WHO ARE WE KIDDING HERE ? - NO , WRONG . IT WAS POLITICAL , JUST AS THIS IS . - I 'M SORRY , YOU JUST SAID A MOMENT AGO THAT THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE WAY THEY COULD UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING . NOW YOU SAY THEIR ULTIMATE AIM WAS DESTRUCTIVE ? - NO ... NO . THERE IS A MASSIVE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO AND NOT KNOWING HOW HISTORY WILL VIEW YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS- - OR MAYBE FAILURE . IF YOU RECALL , THERE WAS WIDESPREAD FEAR AT LOS ALAMOS THAT AN UNCONTROLLED NUCLEAR EXPLOSION COULD SET THE ATMOSPHERE ON FIRE , ENDING LIFE ON EARTH . WE 'RE TALKING ABOUT AN ATOMIC , FISSILE PARTICLE CHAIN REACTION HERE , RIGHT ? CERTAINLY , THESE MEN KNEW THAT THE DEVICE THEY WERE BUILDING WAS DESTRUCTIVE . BUT HOW COULD THEY POSSIBLY HAVE UNDERSTOOD HOW THEIR ENDEAVOR WOULD AFFECT THE FUTURE ? LIKE IF IT WOULD RESULT IN INTERNATIONAL , GLOBAL- - I DON 'T KNOW- - COSMIC HORROR ? IF SOCIETY SOMEHOW SURVIVED SUCH A CATASTROPHE , THEY 'D MOST LIKELY BE VIEWED , WHETHER THROUGH PROPAGANDA OR NOT , AS VILLAINS , WORSE THAN HITLER . - WELL , THE TRUTH , I THINK , LIES SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN . WHY DON 'T WE SHIFT GEARS BEFORE HE ARRIVES AND DISCUSS IF THERE ARE ANY ISSUES WITHIN THE BODY OF THE FINDINGS . I KNOW WE APPLIED OUR OWN EXPERTISE TO PORTIONS OF THE REPORT THAT FIT OUR FIELD , OFTEN INDEPENDENTLY AND WHILE OUR WORK WAS RIGOROUSLY EXAMINED THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS . SO ... I GUESS , ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS ? OR ISSUES WITH ANYONE 'S WORK ? ULTIMATELY , EVERYTHING WAS FUNCTIONAL . BUT NO ONE HAS ANY QUESTIONS , COMMENTS ? - I HAD A HARD TIME VALIDATING YOUR PROOF , DOCTOR . COMPUTATIONALLY , ON THE SURFACE , IT APPEARED CORRECT . IT WAS QUITE ELEGANT , REALLY . BUT , UPON CLOSER EXAMINATION , A POTENTIAL ERROR- - - REALLY ? I THINK WE ALL KNOW IT 'S AIRTIGHT . I MEAN , WE MADE OUR NONDETERMINISTIC PROCESSOR . YOU CAN HOLD IT IN YOUR HAND . IT 'S SIMPLY A PHYSICAL REPRESENTATION OF THE ALGORITHM . - TO BE BLUNT , I 'M STILL NOT CONVINCED THAT YOUR FINAL COMPUTATION CLASS IS COMPUTABLE IN LINEAR TIME . - WHAT , ARE YOU NERVOUS ? IT 'S RIGHT . WE WERE MORE THAN METHODICAL , RIGOROUS , EVEN . REVIEW UPON REVIEW- - IT 'S RIGHT . - I AGREE--THE PROCESSOR WOULDN 'T COMPUTE WHAT IT 'S COMPUTING IF P WASN 'T EQUAL TO NP . - THAT 'S RIGHT . - [ sighs ] LET ME PUT IT ANOTHER WAY . THE MIND 'S FLEXIBILITY- - OR MAYBE I SHOULD SAY PERFORMANCE- - IS DRAMATICALLY HINDERED THE MORE MILEAGE YOU PUT ON IT . I MEAN , CHRIST , IT 'S BASICALLY THE THEME OF HARDY 'S BIOGRAPHY . - JIM ... - P = NP IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICAL COMPLEXITY THEORY . NEARLY EVERY AREA OF KNOWLEDGE IS BASED ON THE IDEA THAT BRUTE-FORCE SEARCH IS HARD , OKAY ? THAT IT TAKES A LONG TIME . WE JUST SHOWED THAT IT 'S EASY . EVERYTHING CHANGES . [ notebook hits table ] THIS COULD PAVE THE WAY FOR--IT 'S- - WHEN WE PROVE THAT P = NP , IT HAS TO BE DONE RIGHT . [ cards shuffling ] - PICK A CARD . COME ON , PICK A CARD . REMEMBER THAT AND PUT IT BACK IN THE DECK . OKAY , NOW , IF I WERE A LOUSY MAGICIAN , I WOULD- - - YOU ARE A LOUSY MAGICIAN . - THE BEST WAY TO FIND YOUR CARD WOULD BE TO GO THROUGH EACH AND ASK YOU , " IS THIS YOUR CARD ? " - NO . - NO . NO . AND SO ON . AND THIS WOULD TAKE FOREVER , OF COURSE . IMAGINE A DECK WITH A MILLION CARDS . - I COULDN 'T POSSIBLY . - RIGHT . NOW ... [ cards shuffling ] IF I HAD THIS PROBLEM WITH OUR NONDETERMINISTIC ORACLE , I WOULD SIMPLY GIVE IT THE DECK , AND I WOULD SAY , " WHICH IS THE RIGHT CARD ? " EMPLOY A LITTLE NONDETERMINISTIC COMPUTATION , AND ... WHAT DO THE FRENCH SAY ? - VOILA ? - VOILA . - QUITE A VISUAL PRESENTATION . SO , IF I CAN GET THIS STRAIGHT , IN YOUR EXPLANATION , THAT I 'M PRETTY SURE I SAW SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE 10th AND 11TH GRADE , THE NONDETERMINISTIC STEP TO SIMPLIFY P = NP AND , ULTIMATELY , THE WORLD , WORKS IN LINEAR TIME BECAUSE THE CARDS SAY SO ? YOU 'RE SIMPLY SUGGESTING THAT YOUR ALGORITHM IS FUNDAMENTAL ? - NO ... I 'M SIMPLY SUGGESTING THAT IT 'S MAGIC . [ applause ] [ cheers and applause ] THANK YOU . THAT 'S VERY KIND OF YOU . AND THANK YOU , DR. ACURI , FOR THAT OVERWHELMINGLY KIND INTRODUCTION . I 'M , UM , VERY HUMBLED AND HONORED TO BE IN FRONT OF YOU THIS EVENING . UM , NOT JUST BECAUSE I 'M A ROOM FULL OF BRILLIANT MATHEMATICIANS , WHICH , OF COURSE , I AM . BUT BECAUSE , NOT TOO LONG AGO , I WAS , IN FACT , DENIED ADMISSION TO THIS VERY UNIVERSITY . [ laughter ] UH , NOT ENOUGH EXTRACURRICULARS , I SUPPOSE . [ chuckles ] UM ... THIS SYMPOSIUM 'S FOCUS IS ON THE FUTURE OF MATHEMATICS , AND I 'VE BEEN ASKED TO SUCCINCTLY ADDRESS THAT TOPIC WITH YOU HERE TONIGHT . IT 'S DIFFICULT , OF COURSE , TO CONTEXTUALIZE SOMETHING SO VAGUE AND BROAD AS THE FUTURE OF MATHEMATICS . IF THE PAST IS ANY INDICATION OF WHAT IS YET TO COME , UM , THAT ANSWER COULD VERY WELL BE ANYTHING . BUT I DON 'T THINK MANY OF YOU WOULD FIND THAT SUMMARY VERY ADEQUATE , SO I WILL ATTEMPT TO DO BETTER . LET 'S , UH , LET 'S BEGIN BY TAKING STOCK OF WHERE WE ARE PRESENTLY . THE EXTRAORDINARY APPLICATION OF MATHEMATICS HAS ALLOWED US LUXURIES AND NECESSITIES SUCH AS MOBILE PHONES , GPS NAVIGATION , AUTOMATIC DISH--DISHWASHERS . IT 'S ALLOWED US COMPUTER GAMES , PORTABLE TELEVISIONS , COMPACT DISC PLAYERS . IT 'S ALLOWED US HIGH-DEFINITION , ORGANIC FOOD DISTRIBUTION , AIRPLANES , CALCULATOR WRISTWATCHES . IT 'S ALLOWED RADIO CONTROL , LASIK EYE SURGERY , LASER BRAIN REDACTION , NONINVASIVE ARTHROSCOPY . IT 'S ALLOWED G5s , C-4 , AND WEAPONS-GRADE U-235 . IT 'S ALLOWED ARTIFICIAL HEARTS AND HEARTLESS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE . IT 'S ALLOWED BLACKBERRIES- - I HOPE THEY 'RE ALL SILENT- - iPHONES AND ALL THE OTHER PORTABLE DEVICES THAT ENSLAVE US TO THE MAN , KEEP US CHAINED TO THE EVER-GROWING CORPORATE CONTINGENCY OF THIS WORLD . IT 'S ALLOWED FACEBOOK , MYSPACE , AND ALL THE OTHER PERVASIVE WEB APPS THAT ENABLE CUTTHROAT ENABLERS AND EXPEDITE THE GREEDY INFILTRATION AND PERVERSION OF OUR YOUTH . IN SHORT , IT 'S ALLOWED THE GOOD , THE BAD , AND EVERYTHING ELSE . [ clock ticking ] [ approaching footsteps ] - GENTLEMEN , THANK YOU FOR WAITING . I 'M SORRY TO BE LATE . BEFORE I FORGET , WOULD YOU JUST PASS THOSE AROUND ? THEY 'RE FROM THE PRESIDENT . HAS EVERYONE EATEN ? EVERYONE 'S WELL ? I THINK THAT TODAY IS A CULMINATION OF MANY THINGS , MANY EMOTIONS . AND I 'M--I 'M HERE TO SAY THANK YOU AND- - I GUESS TO PROVIDE MAYBE A LITTLE CLOSURE TO A PROCESS THAT I 'M SURE HAS SEEMED QUITE ENDLESS . NOW , I DON 'T WANT TO DRAG THIS OUT AND MAKE IT TOO LONG , BUT I 'VE BEEN INSTRUCTED- - WELL , ACTUALLY , PRETTY MUCH ORDERED- - TO MAKE SURE YOU GUYS LEAVE HERE HAPPY AND FULFILLED . HOW 'S THAT GO ? HALL HATH NO FURY LIKE A MATHEMATICIAN SCORNED ? ALL RIGHT , NOW ... IT HAS BEEN OVER A YEAR SINCE WE WERE ALL IN THE SAME ROOM . DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS THAT , HOPEFULLY , I CAN ANSWER ? NO ? ALL RIGHT , WELL , I 'VE GOT A BRIEF AGENDA THAT I WANT TO RUN THROUGH , SO LET 'S JUST PASS THESE AROUND , ALL RIGHT ? FIRST ITEM IS THE ORDER OF COMPENSATION . $ 10 MILLION ANNUITIES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN EACH OF YOUR NAMES . ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS CHECK THE APPROPRIATE BOX NEXT TO THE PAYMENT METHOD . - DIRECT DEPOSIT ? - PARDON ME ? - WILL THIS BE DIRECT DEPOSIT ? - HOWEVER YOUR RESEARCH STIPENDS WERE PAID , THIS WILL BE THE SAME . DOES THAT WORK ? NOW , INCLUDING YOUR ANNUAL STIPENDS , HAS ANYONE HAD ANY ISSUES AT ALL WITH THEIR PAYMENTS THUS FAR ? I HOPE NOT . ALL RIGHT , WELL , YOUR STIPENDS WILL CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS FOR ANY SUPPLEMENTAL RESEARCH THAT MAY BE NEEDED . BUT HOPEFULLY NOT . AND THAT BRINGS YOUR TOTAL FUNDING TO APPROXIMATELY- - WELL , NOT APPROXIMATELY- - TO EXACTLY $ 22 MILLION U.S. DOLLARS , AND THE ANNUITY WILL ULTIMATELY PAY OUT MORE THAN THAT . NOT BAD FOR A FEW YEARS' RESEARCH , IS IT ? GENTLEMEN , BEFORE WE GO TO THE NEXT ITEM , I WANT TO EXPRESS TO YOU THE LEVEL OF GRATITUDE [ voice distorting deeply ] THE PRESIDENT AND THE COUNTRY OWE YOU . [ static ] THIS IS NO SMALL MOMENT IN HISTORY . NEXT IS THE NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT . I KNOW WE HAVE VISITED AND REVISITED THIS ISSUE MANY TIMES OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS . IT 'S A VERY CRITICAL ONE . THE SECOND DOCUMENT REITERATES THE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS IF ANY INFORMATION IS PUBLISHED OR BROADCAST WITHOUT THE DOD OR NSA 'S CONSENT , WHICH BASICALLY MEANS NEVER . - I KNOW THIS PROJECT ITSELF IS CLASSIFIED . IS THERE ANY INTENTION OF ULTIMATELY RELEASING THE FINDINGS TO THE COMMUNITY ? WE ALL HAVE A LOT OF COLLEAGUES WHOSE APPLIED RESEARCH COULD BENEFIT FROM THIS . I MEAN , I 'M TALKING ABOUT METHODS TO CURE CANCER , ESTABLISH A CAUSAL CONNECTION TO PARKINSON 'S , ALZHEIMER 'S- - - RIGHT , RIGHT , WE UNDERSTAND THAT , AND I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE VERY THOUGHTFUL TO THOSE ISSUES . AND WE 'LL PROBABLY TAKE THOSE ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS , BUT FOR RIGHT NOW , I WILL HAVE TO SAY NO . IT WILL REMAIN AS A CLASSIFIED NATIONAL SECURITY ASSET . - I 'M SORRY , THAT 'S NOT WHAT WE SIGNED UP FOR . - WELL , FROM THE OUTSET , I DON 'T THINK ANYONE COULD HAVE PREDICTED THE EXTENT OF YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS . AND WITH THE SENSITIVITY OF THE FINDINGS , IT IS IN OUR COUNTRY 'S BEST INTERESTS TO MAKE SURE THEY REMAIN SAFEGUARDED . - SO IF WE WERE TO PUBLISH ANYTHING IN , SAY , A TRADE JOURNAL- - - YOU COULD BE- - AND , OF COURSE , IT WOULD DEPEND ON WHAT WAS DISCUSSED- - BUT YOU COULD BE IN VIOLATION OF THE PROGRAM 'S NDA , AND AS A RESULT , YOU COULD BE ARRESTED FOR TREASON . NOW , YOUR SECURITY CLEARANCES WILL BE TERMINATED , I BELIEVE WITHIN THE SAME SIX-MONTH TIME FRAME . AFTER THAT , YOU 'LL NO LONGER HAVE ACCESS TO THE COMMUNICATIONS CHANNEL OR THE SECURED NETWORK THAT YOU 'VE ALL USED TO COORDINATE WITH EACH OTHER . WHAT ? - [ sighs ] WELL , I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MUST GIVE THIS SAME SPIEL TO ANY VARIETY OF- - OF , UH ... I DON 'T REALLY KNOW WHO YOU GIVE THIS SPIEL TO . BUT DOESN 'T IT SEEM SOMEWHAT IRONIC , GIVEN YOUR PRESENT AUDIENCE ? - I 'M SORRY . I DON 'T FOLLOW YOU . - I THINK WHAT JIM MEANS IS THAT , IF THERE WERE A SECURED NETWORK , LIKE , UH , SIPRNET OR JWICS , THAT WE WANTED ACCESS TO , WELL , UM ... WE 'D JUST HACK IN AND TAKE IT . - [ laughing ] WELL , I AM SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU , BUT THE DEFENSE SYSTEM THAT YOU JUST REFERENCED IS NOT PART OF ANY NETWORK THAT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO . - WELL , WE 'RE SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU , BUT JUST THE FACT THAT THOSE SYSTEMS ARE ON ANY NETWORK MEANS THEY 'RE VULNERABLE . WHERE WAS IT , DOCTOR , THAT WE DEVELOPED THE SYSTEM TO INFILTRATE SIPRNET ? UH , PRINCETON ? - SURE , YEAH . AND THAT WAS BEFORE WE HAD OUR NONDETERMINISTIC PROCESS . - GENTLEMEN ... - IT WAS PRACTICALLY MY DOCTORAL THESIS . - YES , OF COURSE . - CONGRATULATIONS , GENTLEMEN . YOU HAVE JUST ADMITTED TO SEVEN FELONY COUNTS AND A LEVEL OF TREASON THAT WOULD LAND YOU AT SUPERMAX . LOVELY . - SO YOU 'RE SAYING I SHOULD DELETE THOSE SECRET FILES OFF MY HARD DRIVE ? - I 'M SAYING THAT IF YOU TOOK THIS PROCESS A BIT MORE SERIOUSLY , WE COULD GET OUT OF HERE THAT MUCH SOONER . - I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU , SIR , THAT THIS IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL SEWING CIRCLE . - [ gasps ] [ ominous music ] ♪ - NOW , THAT 'S ALL I HAD AS FAR AS AN AGENDA . BEFORE I TAKE MY LEAVE , DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY MORE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS THAT I CAN ADDRESS ? - WELL , WE WERE ACTUALLY HAVING A BIT OF A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE INCLUSION OF THE ADDENDUM . - SURE . - SOME OF US WERE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT , IN FACT , DOCUMENTING ANY OF THE SYSTEM 'S APPLICATIONS WAS , UH , I GUESS NOT IN THE SPIRIT OF THIS PROJECT 'S ORIGINAL INTENTIONS . - SURE . I ASKED JIM TO INCLUDE THE SUPPLEMENT BECAUSE I WAS ASKED BY MY SUPERIORS AT THE DOD FOR A BRIEF SUMMARY OF WHAT THEIR $ 1 / 4 BILLION INVESTMENT BOUGHT THEM . YOU ARE , AFTER ALL , BEING FUNDED BY THE UNITED STATES TAXPAYERS . DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ? - WELL- - - THAT RESPONSE--SORRY- - THAT RESPONSE IS OVERWHELMINGLY INADEQUATE . - WELL , I GUESS I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THAT . - OKAY , WELL , LET ME PUT IT ANOTHER WAY . YOU HAVE PLENTY OF MATHEMATICIANS AT THE NSA , PRESUMABLY WITH SOME BASELINE LEVEL INTELLIGENCE . YOU HAD TO HAVE KNOWN WHAT THIS PROJECT WOULD MEAN . SO , UM , WELL , WHY DO YOU NEED IT STATED IN THIS DOCUMENT , I GUESS , AND--AND WHY DOES IT ONLY SEEM TO LIST THE MORE DESTRUCTIVE RAMIFICATIONS ? - SCAPEGOATS . - THAT 'S ABSURD . THIS ENDEAVOR 'S HAD NOTHING BUT THE STRICTEST SECURITY , AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A VERY , VERY SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE , NO ONE EVEN KNOWS OF YOUR INVOLVEMENT . SO WHATEVER APPLICATIONS YOUR SYSTEM MAY PROVIDE FOR , YOU WILL ALWAYS REMAIN ENTIRELY ANONYMOUS . - [ sighs ] I FELT EARLIER THAT POSSIBLY INCLUDING THESE FINDINGS IN OUR PUBLICATION WAS ALMOST A RESPONSIBILITY , AS MATHEMATICIANS . BUT NOW , AS I SIT HERE , THAT LOGIC SLOWLY EVAPORATES , AND I 'M LEFT WITH THE IDEA THAT IF SOMETHING TERRIBLE SHOULD EVER HAPPEN , YOU 'D CONVENIENTLY BE ABLE TO SAY , " SEE ? IT WASN 'T OUR IDEA . " - CONVENIENCE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT . - HAS THE INCREASED LEVEL OF CHINESE HACKING ATTACKS HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOUR SUDDEN INTEREST IN OUR SYSTEM 'S APPLICATIONS ? - I WOULDN 'T REALLY KNOW . BUT I ASSUME WE ALL UNDERSTAND , AND I AM NOT AFRAID TO ADMIT , THE NEW COLD WAR HAS BEGUN . A ROOM OF THE FOUR SMARTEST MEN ON THE PLANET , AND YET NOT ONE OF YOU HAS INDICATED ANY UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD 'S REALITY . FUTURE CONFLICTS WILL NOT BE WAGED BY RACING TO JUPITER OR SPLITTING ATOMS OR BUILDING NUCLEAR DEVICES FASTER THAN THE OTHER . NO . THIS IS FAR MORE SUBTLE . IT 'S A PENNY HERE , A PENNY THERE . AN UNRESPONSIVE POWER GRID , A SUBVERTED STOCK EXCHANGE . THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT SPIRALS THE WORLD ECONOMY , AND WHEN THE DUST SETTLES , THE WORLD 'S DIVVIED UP , SMALLER NOW , LIKE VULTURES TO A FAT , MEATY CARCASS . MAYBE WE 'RE STILL A SUPERPOWER . MAYBE WE 'RE NOT . BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE , GENTLEMEN . THE CARTHAGINIANS KNOCK AT THE GATE OF AMERICA . - YOU 'RE IMPLYING THAT GHOSTNET 'S BECOMING A MORE SIGNIFICANT THREAT . - LOOK , OBVIOUSLY I 'M NOT AT LIBERTY TO DISCUSS THAT , BUT SUFFICE IT TO SAY THE CHINESE ARE A CONSTANT SOURCE OF SCRUTINY FROM OUR SECURITY COMMUNITY . - I THINK THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION PRETTY CLEARLY . - IN WHAT WAY ? - IN WHAT WAY ? COME ON , WITH ACCELERATED KEY SEARCH AND DECRYPTION , THE ENTIRE WORLD IS AT YOUR FINGERTIPS . THERE IS LITERALLY NOTHING YOU COULDN 'T SEE . - UNTIL THEY ENCODE THINGS DIFFERENTLY OR DEVELOP A DIFFERENT ARCHITECTURE FOR COMING AT US . - BUT YOU STILL HAVE HOW MANY MONTHS OR YEARS OF ABSOLUTE , UNGUARDED ACCESS TO ANYTHING YOU 'D WANT . FINANCIAL INFORMATION , TECHNICAL INFORMATION , MILITARY DATA , CODED NATIONAL SECRETS . IT 'S THE EQUIVALENT OF- - - BILLIONS . NO , QUICKLY IN MY HEAD , I 'D HAVE TO SAY TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF INFORMATION . - GENTLEMEN- - - I 'M NOT SURE A VALUE CAN REALLY BE PUT ON THAT LEVEL OF INFORMATION . - TRUE , BUT WE CAN ROUGHLY QUANTIFY THINGS HERE . RIGHT ? I MEAN , LET 'S THINK . CHINESE GDP IS AROUND $ 3.2 TRILLION U.S. DOLLARS . ANY CRYPTOSYSTEM THAT USES PSPACE ALGORITHMS , WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY THEIR ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE , COULD EASILY BE ACCESSED . - WELL , THAT MAY WORK FOR A PARTICULAR ASPECT OF A NETWORK , SAY , A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION 'S RECORDS , BUT OTHER SYSTEMS USE A DIFFERENT CRYPTO ALGORITHM . - COME ON . - YOU CAN 'T CRACK IT , BECAUSE IT 'S A DIFFERENT PROBLEM . - THAT 'S UTTERLY RIDICULOUS . WE 'RE NOT EVEN TALKING CUTTING-EDGE THEORY HERE . GARY JOHNSON , GUYS IN THE ' 70s SHOWED THAT , FUNDAMENTALLY , ALL THESE COMPLEX MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS- - KNAPSACK , SAT , WHATEVER- - THEY 'RE ALL THE SAME PROBLEM . - SOLVE ONE , SOLVE ALL . - THAT 'S WHAT THIS IS . THAT 'S WHAT NP-COMPLETE MEANS . MODERN CRYPTOGRAPHY IS BASED ON THE , I GUESS , NOW-OUTDATED REALITY THAT SOME PROBLEMS ARE JUST TOO COMPUTATIONALLY EXPENSIVE TO BRUTE FORCE , RIGHT ? THEY JUST TAKE TOO LONG TO TRY EVERY ANSWER . SO INTRODUCE THE NONDETERMINISTIC PROCESSOR AND PROBLEMS THAT ONCE TOOK MILLIONS OF YEARS TO SOLVE , SOLVED IN MINUTES . - I APPRECIATE THE LECTURE , AND I DO UNDERSTAND THE FUNDAMENTALS , BUT MY GUYS' THEORETICAL RESEARCH POINTS TO THE FACT THAT SEPARATE NETWORKS , SEPARATE ANYTHING , REQUIRES SEPARATE GRIDS WITH DISTINCT COMPUTATIONAL PROBLEMS . - OH , YOUR GUYS ? - YES , RAND . - IT ALL BOILS DOWN TO THE NONDETERMINISTIC ORACLE . WITH IT , WITH THE PROCESSOR , ALL PROBLEMS IN P AND NP SPACE CAN BE COMPUTED IN REASONABLE TIME . KEY SEARCHES , FACTORING , DISCRETE LOGS- - YOU CAN BREAK ANY CRYPTOSYSTEM IN THE WORLD IF YOU HAVE THE WILL AND , I GUESS , THE SOFTWARE PROGRAM TO DO SO . - NOT EVEN A CHINESE HYBRID CRYPTOSYSTEM COULD PREVENT OR EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE AN ATTACK . - NOPE . ANYWAYS , IN MY OPINION , THIS WORKS MORE AS A WEAPON , I GUESS , BY SUBTRACTION OR DESTRUCTION , MUCH IN THE SAME WAY AS A CONVENTIONAL WEAPON , AS OPPOSED TO , SAY , SOME SORT OF , I DON 'T KNOW , INTERGOVERNMENTAL LARCENY . - MEANING ? - MEANING THAT IT 'S IMPRACTICAL TO EMBEZZLE CHINESE MONEY TO , SAY , FUND A FEDERAL EDUCATION BILL , OKAY ? IF YOU WANT MORE MONEY , JUST PRINT MORE . AND AT THIS LEVEL , IT 'LL HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON THEIR ECONOMY . - AND , IF YOU 'RE SOMEHOW DISCOVERED , YOU 'VE ESSENTIALLY DECLARED WAR ON A SUPERPOWER , AND ALL YOU HAVE TO SHOW FOR IT ARE A FEW CLEANER SCHOOLS . - WELL , IT COULD BE WORSE . - REALLY , THE ONLY WAY I SEE IT WOULD BE TO SYSTEMATICALLY ATTACK THE ASSET . BASICALLY , CRIPPLE IT , TAKE IT OUT . - I HAVE TO SAY , IT 'S MUCH EASIER TO DISCUSS APPLICATION WHEN IT 'S CONTEXTUALIZED LIKE THIS . - SO SAY YOU 'RE ABOUT TO LAUNCH A CYBER-ATTACK ON CHINA , WHAT WOULD LOGICALLY BE YOUR FIRST TARGET ? - POWER PLANTS . - WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT ? - KILL THE POWER , STIFLE THE DEFENSIVE GRID . THE COUNTRY WOULD BE MOST VULNERABLE . - YEAH , BUT IF YOU CUT THE POWER , THEN NOTHING 'S CONNECTED- - HOW CAN YOU HACK A NETWORK THAT 'S NOT ONLINE ? NO , I THINK IF YOU WANT TO USE THIS AS A WEAPON , FIRST , YOU CRUSH THEIR ENTIRE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM . BASICALLY ACT AS THE COUNTRY 'S BRAIN . YOU CAN RECEIVE AND TRANSMIT ANYTHING YOU LIKE . MASS HYSTERIA , PARANOIA . ALMOST LIKE A WATER-BASED TOXIN . YOU COULD TEAR THE COUNTRY APART . I KNOW CHINA IS A LODESTONE HERE , BUT I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE TOTALLY NAIVE TO IGNORE OUR ALLIES- - ISRAEL , RUSSIA , ENGLAND . IF HISTORY HAS TAUGHT US ANYTHING , IT 'S THAT ALLEGIANCES ARE MADE FOR SELF-GAIN . THERE IS LITERALLY NO ONE YOU CAN TRUST . - I 'M SURE THE TRUST ISSUE WILL GO OVER WELL WITH OUR ALLIES AS WE EXPLAIN TO THEM WHY WE COMPLETELY HACKED THEIR COMMUNICATION NETWORK . - THAT 'S WHY WE DON 'T GET CAUGHT . - RIGHT . LOOK ... THIS IS A FOREIGN POLICY DISCUSSION NONE OF US ARE PREPARED FOR , AND FRANKLY , WE 'RE ALL OUT OF OUR ELEMENT . - I DON 'T KNOW HOW MUCH THAT 'S TRUE . - STILL , AS MUCH AS I THOUGHT OUR PROJECT 'S IMPLICATIONS SHOULD BE DISCUSSED , THE SUDDEN INCLUSION OF THE ADDENDUM IS A CLEAR BREACH OF THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT . - LISTEN , DECEPTION OR ANYTHING ALONG THOSE LINES WAS NEVER PART OF OUR GOAL , AND NOT THAT IT MATTERS TO YOU , BUT THIS ISSUE IS NOT AS BLACK AND WHITE AS YOU 'RE MAKING IT SOUND . THREE WEEKS AFTER THE ORIGINAL ARRANGEMENT WAS DISCUSSED , GHOSTNET PENETRATED A SECURE NORAD DEFENSE SYSTEM , THE CONTENTS OF WHICH CONTAIN TOP-SECRET NUCLEAR DATA , INCLUDING THE LONGITUDINAL COORDINATES OF EVERY MAJOR MISSILE BATTERY ON THE EAST COAST . FOUR MONTHS AFTER THAT , U.S. ARMY CALL SIGN DATABASE WAS HIT . THAT 'S INFORMATION CONTAINED ON SUCH A NEED-TO-KNOW BASIS THAT IT 'S GENERALLY ACCEPTED THAT THE PRESIDENT DOESN 'T NEED TO KNOW . - WELL , MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE HIRED US TO SECURE THOSE PARTICULAR SYSTEMS . - IN A WAY , WE DID . MY SUPERIORS AND I FIND A CERTAIN NOBILITY IN YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS . MOTIVES ASIDE , YOU WERE HIRED TO DO SOMETHING THAT GODEL , VON NEUMANN , EVERYONE DEEMED IMPOSSIBLE . YET YOU DID IT FOR YOUR COUNTRY . - NOBODY 'S DENYING THAT THERE 'S SOMETHING NOBLE ABOUT THE TRUE PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE OR NATIONAL PRIDE , WHATEVER . BUT RIGHT NOW , I HAVE THE SINKING FEELING THAT ALL THAT 'S BEING LOST . - I MERELY DID AS ASKED . - YEAH , SO DID THE GUARDS AT AUSCHWITZ . - YOU CAN GO TO HELL FOR SAYING THAT . - GODWIN 'S LAW STRIKES AGAIN . - AND IN TERMS OF ANY CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION FOR PRESENT OR FUTURE WORK , AS FAR AS I 'M CONCERNED , THE INCLUSION OF THIS ADDENDUM IS A CLEAR BREACH OF CONTRACT . - WELL , I GUESS , IN THAT CASE , THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CAN JUST RIP UP YOUR PAYCHECKS AND CANCEL THE ANNUITIES . WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO , SUE US ? - MAYBE . - COME ON , THIS IS NOT A BURDEN . YOU SERVE AT THE PLEASURE OF THE PRESIDENT . THIS IS YOUR PATRIOTIC DUTY , DONE IMMACULATELY WELL , IN AN INCREASINGLY AGGRESSIVE WORLD , OKAY ? - YOU--YOU SPEAK TO US LIKE WE 'RE LOCKHEED AND WE JUST DEVELOPED SOME FANCY DRONE AIRPLANE THAT MAY OR MAY NOT EVER WORK . - IN A WAY , YES . WE LOOK AT YOUR SYSTEM AS A NATIONAL ASSET . - YOU ARE SO STUPID . - DON 'T YOU CONDESCEND TO ME . I AM NOT HERE TO BE RIDICULED . - COOLER HEADS , GUYS . - NO , YOU 'RE HERE TO- - TO MAKE SURE WE 'RE HAPPY . YOU 'RE A TIRE SALESMAN . - I WILL ENTERTAIN A CIVIL DISCUSSION , YES , BUT I 'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND BE ATTACKED . - YES , YOU WILL . - EXCUSE ME ? - IT 'S YOUR JOB TO SIT HERE . YOU 'VE BEEN ORDERED TO . THOUGH POWER MAY LIE HERE , ULTIMATELY , IT 'S THE FOUR OF US THAT MUST ACCEPT THIS FATE , NOT FORCE-FED . TRULY , IF THIS IS A PATRIOTIC DUTY , AS YOU 'RE SUGGESTING , WE COULD QUITE SIMPLY CONQUER , DESTROY , ERADICATE , AND ANY OTHER DESTRUCTIVE VERB YOU CAN THINK OF , WITHOUT REPRISAL , WITHOUT MERCY , WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE . SURELY SOME DUTY OUGHT TO BE PAID TO THAT REALITY . - THAT 'S ONLY THE BEGINNING . - THERE 'S A WAR BEING WAGED IN CYBERSPACE , WHETHER ANYONE WANTS TO ADMIT IT OR NOT . AND FOR REASONS OF ECONOMIES OF SCALE , THE UNITED STATES AND ITS ALLIES ARE DRAMATICALLY BEHIND . EACH WEEK , THE NSA ESTIMATES THAT 233 COMPUTERS IN THE DISTRICT ARE COMPROMISED , MANY OF THEM IN CLASSIFIED FACILITIES . THERE IS SUCH AN AWARENESS OF CYBER ESPIONAGE THAT THE MAJORITY OF NSA CORRESPONDENCES HAVE REVERTED TO HANDWRITTEN PIECES OF PAPER THAT ARE EITHER BURNED AFTER READING OR LOCKED AWAY . DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA THE QUANTITY OF TOP-SECRET CORRESPONDENCES THAT ARE HAND-DELIVERED BY TRUSTED COURIERS EACH YEAR ? IT 'S STAGGERING . THIS IS THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD . THIS IS NOW . - THIS IS BIGGER THAN YOUR SECRETS . - AS AN AMERICAN , I DON 'T KNOW HOW ANYONE COULD SAY THAT . - AS A MATHEMATICIAN , IT 'S MY CONSCIENCE TO SAY THAT . - THEN WHY DON 'T YOU BREAK IT DOWN FOR ME A LITTLE SLOWER , SO I CAN UNDERSTAND . - HARDY CALLED MATHEMATICS THE LANGUAGE OF THE GODS BECAUSE IT , UH , IT UNLOCKS AND CATEGORIZES THINGS THAT THE MIND CAN 'T POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND . I-I DON 'T EXPECT YOU TO AT THIS POINT . BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN FOUNDATIONAL PROOFS , OKAY , THAT LEAD TO MORE POWERFUL CONCLUSIONS . TO LOCK THIS AWAY SO YOU CAN SPY ON SOMEBODY IS CRIMINAL . - OH , THAT IS SO IGNORANT AND CONDESCENDING IT MAKES ME WANT TO SPIT . THIS WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT UNSOLVED PROBLEM IN COMPUTER SCIENCE . TO THINK YOU WERE THE ONLY MATHEMATICIANS IN THE WORLD FOCUSING YOUR EFFORTS ON THIS IS NAIVE . YOU 'RE PAWNS , AUTOMATONS . WE FUNDED YOU . WE BROUGHT YOU TOGETHER . YOU WERE DENIED NOTHING . THOUGHT WAS FOSTERED , AND , ULTIMATELY , A SOLUTION WAS ACHIEVED . YOU WERE A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE . A COG . SEPARATELY , YOU 'RE NOTHING . YOU WERE THE PEOPLE WE MOCKED GROWING UP . BUT COLLECTIVELY , YOU HAVE ALTERED WORLD HISTORY AND PUT THE PROPER POWER IN THE PROPER HANDS . BUT DON 'T FORGET YOUR ORIGIN . YOU WERE MADE . A SOLDERED LINK IN A GREATER CHAIN REACTION . - [ grunting ] 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 ... - COME IN . - [ panting ] 22 , 23 ... - DR. HORTON . - [ laughs ] OH . COME ON . [ sighs ] OKAY . [ marker scraping ] UH , IT 'S A NICE EFFORT , BUT LET 'S FOCUS MORE ON SIMPLIFYING THE ALGORITHMS BEFORE DRAWING THE CONCLUSIONS . - YOU KNOW , I CAN TAKE CARE OF THOSE INQUIRIES FOR YOU . - YEAH , WELL ... YOU KNOW , I HATE THE IVORY TOWER WE 'VE GOT HERE . I DON 'T THINK DR. HAWKING 'S HAD A CONVERSATION WITH A STUDENT IN , LIKE , 25 YEARS . - WELL , I THINK THE VOICE MACHINE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SLIGHT IMPEDIMENT . - [ chuckles ] - THOUGH IT IS A HIT AT THE STAFF MEETINGS . DID YOU KNOW , I FOUND OUT THAT WHEN ISAAC NEWTON WAS A FELLOW AT TRINITY , HE WAS IN THE OFFICE RIGHT NEXT DOOR ? - REALLY ? - YES . - HUGH , WHAT WOULD YOU THINK IF THERE WERE AN ALGORITHM THAT COULD PROVE ITSELF , LIKE AN AUTOMATED PROOF SOLVER . IN OTHER WORDS , EVERY TIME IT FOUND A SOLUTION , IT ALSO FOUND ANOTHER PROBLEM- - A NEW PROBLEM . IT WOULD SOLVE ONE AND THEN THE NEXT , AND THEN THE NEXT AND ... IT COULD ITERATE AD INFINITUM . - WHAT WOULD I THINK ? - YEAH . - WELL ... SINCE I 'M ASSUMING YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING WELL BEYOND THE PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM HERE , I WOULD SAY IT 'S , UH , A SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES SOLUTIONS WITHOUT EVER CONCLUDING . YOU KNOW , ALWAYS POSING THE QUESTION , " WHAT 'S NEXT ? " ALMOST LIKE A COMPUTER WORM . - YES , BUT BIGGER , YOU KNOW ? I 'M THINKING MORE GENERALIZED . LIKE , UH ... WELL , IT 'LL SOLVE ANY PROBLEM , NOT JUST PROBLEMS IT KNOWS ABOUT . ANYTHING IT ENCOUNTERS . - THAT 'S IMPOSSIBLE . I MEAN , THAT 'S PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE , EVEN IN AN APPLIED SENSE . SOLVING ONE PROBLEM WOULD JUST TAKE FOREVER . IT 'S NP-COMPLETE . - WELL , LET 'S PRETEND THAT , UH , IT DOESN 'T TAKE FOREVER . P AND NP DON 'T MATTER . FINDING SOLUTIONS IS FAST . - REALLY ? THE ONLY THING THAT POWERFUL WOULD , UH , BE THE SUN . - YEAH , BUT LET 'S KEEP IT MORE TERRESTRIAL , LIKE , UH , PROMETHEUS OR NEWTON 'S CRADLE , OKAY ? THE ONLY SOLUTION IS THAT THERE CAN 'T POSSIBLY BE ANY MORE SOLUTIONS . - LIKE A CHAIN REACTION ? - YEAH . I MEAN ... WHAT WOULD YOU THINK ? - [ sighs ] I DON 'T KNOW . - THANK YOU . [ receding footsteps ] - AHH . I , UH , HAD DINNER A WEEK OR SO AGO WITH THE PRESIDENT AND THE DEFENSE SECRETARY . NATURALLY , THEY 'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT YOUR WORK HERE , AND BLAH , BLAH , BLAH . THEN I WAS ABLE TO SLIDE SOMETHING PAST HIM . THERE 'S A FARMER IN THE PROVENCE REGION OF FRANCE WHO HAS AN EXTRAORDINARILY INTELLIGENT HORSE . HE CAN ACTUALLY GIVE IT ARITHMETIC PROBLEMS , AND IT WILL TAP OUT THE ANSWER WITH ITS HOOF . SO WE CALLED IN EXPERTS AND RESEARCHERS TO LOOK AT THE HORSE , AND THEY WERE FASCINATED BY HIM . AS THEY TESTED HIM , THEY FOUND OUT THAT IT COULD ANSWER ALGEBRA , EUCLIDIAN GEOMETRY , CALCULUS , AND EVEN GROUP THEORY . BUT WHEN THEY PUT A PROBLEM DOWN THAT HAD CARTESIAN COORDINATES IN IT , THE HORSE JUST STOOD THERE , DUMBLY , LIKE ANY OTHER HORSE . AND I THOUGHT , " THAT 'S PRETTY STRANGE , CONSIDERING HOW INTELLIGENT THE HORSE IS . " SO THEN THEY CALLED IN ONE MORE EXPERT , WHO EXAMINED THE HORSE , AND HE FIGURED OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS . SO I TURNED TO THE PRESIDENT , AND I SAID , " DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE DIAGNOSIS WAS ? " - SURE ! IT COULDN 'T UNDERSTAND CARTESIAN COORDINATES BECAUSE THAT 'D BE PUTTING " DESCARTES " BEFORE THE HORSE . SORRY , WAS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE RHETORICAL ? - [ grunts ] WE 'RE ALL VERY IMPRESSED . YOU KNOW , IT 'S EXHAUSTING HAVING SOMEONE LIKE YOU IN THE ROOM , ALWAYS WITH AN ANSWER . - IF ANYTHING , WHAT YOU SAID BRINGS TO MIND SOME ISSUES OF MORALITY HERE , SINCE THE DISCUSSION HAS SHIFTED TO , I GUESS , A MORE APPLIED ARENA . - HOW DOES WHAT I SAID BRING YOU ANYWHERE NEAR THERE ? - WHO CARES ? - NO , I 'M SAYING THIS IS SOMETHING I DON 'T THINK WE 'VE DISCUSSED . IT DOESN 'T DIRECTLY DEAL WITH OUR SYSTEM 'S APPLICATIONS AS MUCH AS , YOU KNOW ... - PLAYING GOD ? - WELL , I MEAN , COME ON . MORE LIKE SABOTAGE , THEFT , PUBLIC SECRETS , ESPIONAGE . THE QUESTION JUST BEGS TO BE ASKED : JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN DO SOMETHING , DOES IT MEAN YOU SHOULD ? - HYPOTHETICALLY , WHY NOT ? WHAT 'S TO STOP SOMEONE ? - I DON 'T THINK ANYONE 'S IN THE BUSINESS OF CASUALLY SIPHONING MONEY OR SECRETS . THERE HAS TO BE SOME MOTIVE . IMPETUS . - WELL , HERE 'S AN EASY ONE : NATIONAL SECURITY . - WELL , CLEARLY , BUT IF THERE 'S NO WAY TO MONITOR WHAT YOU 'RE DOING , ARE WE JUST SUPPOSED TO TRUST THAT YOU WON 'T BE- - I-I DON 'T KNOW , INVADING PRIVACY OR- - - WHAT , IN OUR INFINITE SPARE TIME ? - WELL , HOW ABOUT THE PATRIOT ACT ? WARRANTLESS PHONE TAPS ? I MEAN , COME ON , THIS IS NOT THAT MUCH OF A STRETCH . - HAS ANYONE IN THIS ROOM USED THE SYSTEM TO DO ANYTHING UNTOWARD ? ANYONE ? - WHAT 'S YOUR POINT ? - HIS POINT IS THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN DO SOMETHING , DOES NOT MEAN YOU WILL . - NO , MY POINT IS MERELY THAT NOBODY IN THIS ROOM HAS EVER TRIED TO APPLY THE SYSTEM . - CONGRATULATIONS . THE FOUR OF YOU HAVE ENOUGH SELF-CONTROL TO NOT PUSH THE BIG , RED BUTTON . THE REALITY IS THAT JUST BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS CAPABLE OF DOING SOMETHING DOES NOT MEAN IT EXECUTES IT . - 250,000 RESIDENTS OF TWO JAPANESE CITIES MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT VERSION OF HISTORY FOR YOU . - OH , SUDDENLY , THE IDEALIST . YOU KNOW , IT 'S SO HARD TO KEEP UP WITH YOU . I 'M NOT SURE WHETHER- - - YOU KNOW , I 'M NOT SURE WHAT I AM , BUT I DO KNOW THAT THIS ANTAGONISTIC ATTITUDE , WHICH I 'M SURE TERRIFIES AND OPPRESSES ALL YOUR LITTLE SUBORDINATES BACK AT THE OFFICE , IN THIS VENUE , IT 'S REALLY UNINTERESTING , OKAY ? - AND I 'M NOT SURE WHERE YOU GET THE IDEA THAT ANYONE BORN AFTER 1950 IS INTERESTED IN SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED 65 YEARS AGO , AS IF THAT 'S STILL A RELEVANT TOPIC- - - RIGHT , LIKE LEARNING SOMETHING FROM HISTORY I SUCH A HORRIBLE IDEA ? - AND EVERYONE IN MY WORLD IS REALLY INTERESTED IN TAKING DIPLOMACY LESSONS FROM A MATH-RAT . - AND NO ONE OUTSIDE YOUR WORLD HAS ANYTHING INTELLIGENT TO ADD TO A GLOBAL POLICY DISCUSSION . - IF THEY 'RE NOT QUALIFIED , NO . IT BOILS DOWN TO THE FACT THAT THE SYSTEM 'S OURS NOW . WE OWN IT- - WE OWN IT BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT CAN PROTECT OUR CITIZENS . WE OWN IT BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT CAN HELP CREATE A MORE COHESIVE WORLD ORDER , A MORE PROSPEROUS FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR CHILDREN 'S CHILDREN . - GENTLEMEN , I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A STEP BACK HERE- - - WHOSE CHILDREN ARE WE TALKING ABOUT , MINE OR YOURS ? - WE OWN IT BECAUSE WE BELIEVE , IF NEEDED , ITS APPLICATION CAN HELP RESTORE PEACE , ALLOCATE MONEY , STOP CORRUPTION , PROTECT ASSETS , AND ULTIMATELY SECURE THE WORLD 'S TRANSACTIONS . YOU 'RE SMIRKING . AM I BEING FUNNY ? - YEAH , IT 'S ALL SO FUNNY . THE INSTANTANEOUS EVAPORATION OF YEARS OF PROMISES . I MEAN , AM I THE ONLY ONE HEARING HIM ? I PUT A LIFETIME 'S WORTH OF RESEARCH INTO THE FACT THAT THIS WOULD ALWAYS LIVE IN MY WORLD AND NOT YOURS . - WELL , I AM TRULY SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU , BUT IN THE FOUR INTERVENING YEARS SINCE THIS WAS FIRST DISCUSSED IN CHICAGO , A FEW SLIGHT CHANGES HAVE OCCURRED GLOBALLY : THE UNPRECEDENTED ECONOMIC GROWTH OF COMMUNIST CHINA , THE RADICALLY RESURGENT RUSSIAN INTEREST IN NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION , NORTH KOREA , CONSTANT CYBER WARFARE , MILITARY ASSETS BEING COMPROMISED AND AMERICAN LIVES BEING LOST AT THE WHIM OF A KEYSTROKE ! THIS IS NOT THE WORLD OF EISENHOWER ! THIS IS NOT THE WORLD OF MACHIAVELLI ! - THERE REALLY IS NO POINT- - - LET THEM SPEAK . - HARDY BELIEVED THAT PURE MATHEMATICS WERE , ON THE WHOLE , DISTINCTLY MORE USEFUL THAN APPLIED . YOU SEE , WHAT 'S ACTUALLY USEFUL FOR MATHEMATICIANS , AND BY EXTENSION , MANKIND , ARE THE FOUNDATIONAL PROOFS UPON WHICH COMPLEXITY THEORY- - MATHEMATICS--IS BASED . THIS , SIR , I-IS AN ABOMINATION . DECEIT , CORRUPTION . AND HARDY WOULD- - - YOU ARE NOT HARDY . - THAT 'S RIGHT . HE 'S BETTER . [ rain falling ] [ faint clink ] [ ominous music ] ♪ - OH , NO .

NO ! IT 'S NOT AN OBLIGATION ! AGH ! [ screaming ] - YOUR BOWELS TAKEN THENCE ... AND YOUR BRAIN 'S BLED OF ALL ITS KNOWLEDGE . - [ screaming ] - NO , NO , THAT IS NOT WHAT I 'M SAYING . A LOT OF QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY , AND MANY OF THE ANSWERS HAVE SIMPLY BEEN INADEQUATE . - WELL , I APOLOGIZE , BUT I PERSONALLY CAME DOWN HERE TO PROVIDE SOME CLOSURE , AND ON SOME LEVEL , I 'M FEELING ATTACKED . - RIGHT , UNDERSTOOD , BUT THIS IS REALLY BECOMING AN ISSUE OF RESPONSIBILITY HERE . IN OTHER WORDS , IF OUR NONDETERMINISTIC PROCESSOR IS USED UNJUSTIFIABLY , THERE WILL BE , IN OUR COMMUNITY , A SUBSTANTIAL RECORD , OR SHOULD I SAY INDICATION , THAT ANY OR ALL OF US WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHATEVER MESS- - - COME ON , WHAT DID YOU EXPECT ? - I EXPECTED PROTECTION . - DON 'T YOU THINK THE WORLD , THE MATHEMATICAL COMMUNITY , WILL HAVE SOME UNDERSTANDING THAT OUR TRUE INTENTIONS WERE FOR THE GOOD OF SCIENCE ? ALTRUISTIC- - - MAYBE , BUT PASSIVE ACCEPTANCE OF EVERYTHING- - - THERE 'S BEEN NO PASSIVE ACCEPTANCE ! HE 'S BEEN ATTACKED IN AN ACCUSATORY MANNER . - PLEASE STOP CUTTING ME OFF ! I 'M JUST TRYING TO SIMPLY SAY THAT THIS IS NOT BLACK AND WHITE . " OH , THEY WERE DOING IT FOR SCIENCE . " WELL DONE , LADS , THIS POST-APOCALYPTIC WINTER IS JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED . " THINGS BECAME MORE COMPLICATED TODAY . THERE HAVE BEEN ADMISSIONS MADE . - WHAT ADMISSIONS ? GENTLEMEN , PLEASE , WE 'RE GOING ROUND AND ROUND HERE . IT 'S UNDERSTANDABLE , AFTER THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS YOU 'VE MADE , TO FEEL APPREHENSIVE , BELIEVE ME . I HAVE BEEN THERE BEFORE WITH OTHER PROJECTS . - LIKE WHAT ? - EXCUSE ME ? - YOU SAID YOU 'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE WITH OTHER PROJECTS- - WHICH ONES ? - WHAT ? - WELL , AS A MEMBER OF A FAIRLY WELL-INFORMED COMMUNITY , I 'M EAGER TO LEARN WHAT OTHER PROJECT WAS COMPLETED UNDER YOUR TENURE , ONE THAT CHANGED THE NATURE OF HUMANITY .

THE LEVEL OF SELF-ABSORPTION- - - I WAS TRYING TO PASSIVELY ENGAGE THINGS , BUT IT 'S NOW ALARMING HOW LITTLE YOU SEEM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU HAVE RIGHT HERE- - - MODERN-DAY SHAMANS , PEDDLING THE EXTRAORDINARY . THE WORLD IS NOT AS COMPLEX AS YOU BELIEVE . THIS DIVISIVENESS IS NOT AS DEEP AS YOUR IMAGINATION- - - YOUR OVERSIMPLIFICATION IS RECKLESS ! - AND QUITE FRANKLY , THE TOTAL TONNAGE OF WHAT I 'M PRIVY TO AND YOU ARE NOT WOULD WAKE A CORPSE FROM ITS GRAVE ! - WELL , WE 'RE ALL PRETTY SMART GUYS . WHY DON 'T YOU ENLIGHTEN US ? - BECAUSE I DON 'T REALLY CARE THAT MUCH . I 'M NOT INTERESTED IN BROADENING THE PERSPECTIVES OF INTELLIGENTSIA . - YOU ALREADY SAID THAT YOUR HOPE FOR OUR SYSTEM WAS THAT IT MIGHT CREATE A MORE COHESIVE WORLD ORDER . WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ? - WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR ? - HOW ' BOUT SOME ANSWERS ? - WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME ? [ softly ] THESE MEETINGS CAN OFTEN BE UNPLEASANT . [ clears throat ] YOU HAVE BEEN PAID . CONSIDER YOURSELF DEBRIEFED . - SIT DOWN . - [ sniffs ] - I WANT A DOCUMENT DRAFTED STATING THE PROOF P = NP BELONGS TO THE FOUR OF US . YOU CAN HAVE THE DESIGN FOR THE PROCESSOR , CLASSIFY IT IF YOU WANT , BUT THE PROOF , AS ORIGINALLY PROMISED , IS OURS . FURTHERMORE- - - I 'M NOT SURE WHERE YOU GET OFF INSTRUCTING ME TO THE FUCKING TOILET . - FURTHERMORE , I WANT THE CLASSIFIED ADDENDUM WITH ANY REFERENCE TO OUR NAMES OR APPLICATIONS REMOVED . - THIS IS NOT A NEGOTIATION . - WELL , I SUGGEST YOU MAKE IT ONE . - WHAT IS ANY OF THAT GOING TO DO , HIDING IT ? NOW , I , FOR ONE , WOULD PREFER THIS TECHNOLOGY BE LICENSED TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR . THINK ABOUT IT- - IT 'S THE SAFEST WAY TO AVOID WHAT WE ALL FEAR , WHICH IS BASICALLY A MONOPOLY- - GEOPOLITICALLY , CORPORATELY . I DON 'T CARE . LICENSE IT TO INTEL . LICENSE IT TO AMD , ANYONE . THE NEW NONDETERMINISTIC PROCESSOR WILL BLAZE A TRAIL FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF PRIVATIZED SCIENTIFIC ADVANCEMENT . THINK ABOUT IT , PREDICTING PROTEIN STRUCTURES AS NP-COMPLETE . - IT WON 'T HAPPEN . - WHAT WON 'T ? - WHAT YOU 'RE SUGGESTING . IT WON 'T HAPPEN . - WHY ? - IT 'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD 'VE SEEN A LONG TIME AGO . - IT 'S MORE VALUABLE TO THEM IF IT 'S KEPT A SECRET . - IT 'S BETTER FOR ALL OF US . - I 'M SORRY . SO WHERE DO WE STAND HERE ? - WELL , IN RESPONSE TO DR. HORTON 'S REQUEST , I HAVE NEITHER THE AUTHORITY NOR INTEREST IN ALTERING THE AGREEMENT , AND ANY DEVIATION FROM THAT WOULD BE CONSTRUED- - AGAIN , BY MY SUPERIORS- - AS A BREACH OF CONTRACT AND RESULT IN THE FORFEITURE OF ANY FUTURE COMPENSATION .

[ sets pen down ] - DOCTOR . - PROFESSOR . - HOW 'S IT GO AGAIN ? - BOATS AGAINST THE CURRENT . - IN 37 YEARS OF MATHEMATICAL RIGOR , I 'VE BEEN STRUCK BY ONE CONSTANT TRUTH- - THAT THE NUMBER IS ALWAYS LARGER THAN MY MIND .

NONE OF US CAN POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THIS PROOF . HISTORY HAS SHOWN US AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT , WITH EVERY GENERATION , THE IMPLICATIONS OF P VERSUS NP GROW GREATER , SO ... IT 'S LEFT TO OUR IMAGINATIONS WHAT THIS MIGHT MEAN IN 20 YEARS , 50 YEARS , 100 . BUT NONE OF YOU- - I PROMISE YOU THIS- - NONE OF YOU UNDERSTANDS THE TRUE POWER OF WHAT OUR SYSTEM CAN DO . - OH , FOR CHRIST 'S SAKE . I 'M SO SICK OF YOUR CONDESCENDING BULLSHIT , OKAY ? THIS ENTIRE " I 'M HOLIER THAN THOU " ATTITUDE I 'VE HAD TO SIT THROUGH FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS IS NAUSEATING . WE 'VE BEEN DEALT WITH FAIRLY . WE 'VE AGREED TO THE TERMS .

THIS IS ABSURD . - WHAT DO YOU MEAN , INCOMPLETE ? - I MEAN THAT IT WASN 'T EXTENDED TO ITS FULLEST TERMINATION . THE DOCUMENTATION OBSCURES THE FINAL COMPUTATION CLASS . THE PROCESSOR 'S ORACLE LACKS SPECIFICITY . I , UH , OMITTED SOME DETAILS IN- - - THIS IS IDIOTIC ! THERE ARE THREE OTHER MEN AT THIS TABLE THAT HAVE PORED OVER EVERY ASPECT- - DILIGENCE !

BUT TO BROADEN IT TO THE SCOPE YOU 'RE TALKING IS SIMPLY ABSURD . - NO . - OH , NO ? - THIS IS ALMOST PATHETIC . - NO , AND YOU KNOW , FROM AN APPLIED PERSPECTIVE , IT 'S NOT EVEN THAT COMPLICATED . YOU JUST NEED A BIT MORE IMAGINATION . - [ scoffs ] - SAY YOU HAVE A TARGET , OKAY ? A BANK , RIGHT ? WE ALL KNOW THAT REDUNDANT SECURITY MEASURES EMBEDDED WITHIN THE BANK 'S FRAMEWORK , WHEN TRIGGERED , IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN , OKAY ?

IT DOESN 'T MAKE YOU THE KING OF EVERY ROOM YOU WALK INTO . - THAT 'S TRUE . - THINK JUST BECAUSE YOUR PICTURE 'S PLASTERED ON THE PAGES OF TEXTBOOKS MEANS YOU HAVE THE POWER TO PLAY- - WHAT YOU 'RE DESCRIBING IS A HACKING ALGORITHM ON A SCALE LIKE NOTHING EVER EARTHLY DEVISED .

YOU CAN 'T LOCK IT AWAY ! - NO , NO , YOU SEE , YOU 'RE ALMOST SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR SIGNIFICANT MATHEMATICAL CONTRIBUTION . EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU CAN DO , I NOW CONTROL- - YOU 'RE NOTHING . SO I ASK YOU AGAIN- - THIS THREAT OF YOURS , WHATEVER IT IS , WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ? - THERE 'S LITERALLY NOTHING I CAN 'T DO . - YOU ARE SO FULL OF SHIT . - DOCTOR , THIS IS PARANOIA . - BUT IF IT COMES DOWN TO YOU OR NO ONE , I 'LL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO MAKE SURE THIS SYSTEM NEVER SEES THE LIGHT OF DAY . - WELL , THIS IS A DISGUSTING DISPLAY , AND WHY WOULD YOU ? - EXCUSE ME ? - WHY WOULD YOU RISK EVERYTHING ? - BECAUSE IT 'S WHAT 'S RIGHT ! - I MEAN , WHEN YOU HAVE SO MUCH GOING FOR YOU . INTERNATIONAL RESPECT . I MEAN , THE FIELDS MEDAL . CAREER . MONEY . FAMILY .

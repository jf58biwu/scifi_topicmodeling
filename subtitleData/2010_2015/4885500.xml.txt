I 'm afraid you 've got it all wrong . Really ... Did you think I 'd keep an animal like you close to me without some kind of insurance policy ? Clearly , you are my greatest failure . Now , at long last ... You will DIE ! [ Jim Raynor : ] Change of plans . You can never suffer enough for all the lives you 've ruined , Arcturus . I made you into a monster , Kerrigan ! You made us all into monsters . Thank you , Jim ... For everything . My pleasure , darlin ' . Always was ... I now see my true enemy . He waits for me in the void , wielding powers I cannot imagine . I go to face him , having renounced everything ... My humanity , my identity ... The man I love . But I will not face this enemy alone . I am the Swarm .

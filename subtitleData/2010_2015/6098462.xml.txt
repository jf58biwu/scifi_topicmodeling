 Give it up ! Dimension Bomber ! Spiral Kick ! Laser Blade ! I 'll have to trust those blueprints ... ! Gavan Hyper Dynamic ! Don Horror forever ... ! They let me wear the fancy silver for a reason . Ichimonji Geki Space Sheriff Why ... ? Why are Makuu members causing trouble again ? The three major organized crime syndicates that the Galactic Union Police had dismantled : Makuu , Madou , Fuuma ; crimes that seem to be connected to these groups have begun occurring on planets across the universe . Among those , the most violent have been from an organization claiming the title " Neo-Madou " . Their chief executive , General Guylerand distributing " Hyper-M " , a controlled substance capable of turning ordinary humans into killing machines . Here we have footage of General Guyler that has been uploaded to a video hosting website . Hyper-M amplifies muscular capacity in addition to being a powerful analgesic that eliminates sensations of pain . The downside being that use of the drug is fatal if an antidote is not administered shortly after . A bit of this ... and you can turn an old fogey or little kid into an unkillable supersoldier ! It 's one hell of a drug . Hyper-M ! General Guyler is so bad ! Planet Bird The Galactic Union Police Planet Bird is a police organization whose headquarters is located on the planet Bird deep in the universe . Planet Bird is a police organization whose headquarters is located on the planet Bird deep in the universe . Is a police organization whose headquarters is located on the planet Bird deep in the universe . Galactic Union Police HQ Under the supervision of Commissioner Gordon intergalactic crime by dispatching Space Sheriffs throughout the entire universe Are Makuu and Madou remnants behind these incidents ? No , sir . Something about it seems off ... Nicholas Gordon Galactic Union Police Commissioner Something about it seems off ... Nicholas Gordon Galactic Union Police Commissioner It all seems ... superficial . Erma Secretary There 's no uniting ideology , Or greater will tying it all together ... Efina Secretary There 's no uniting ideology , Or greater will tying it all together ... Then ... you believe they 're copycat crimes ? Yes . I think it 's likely these are copycat criminals imitating the well known crime syndicates . That 's ridiculous ... Copycat crimes occurring on this kind of scale , independently ? There has to be some kind of connection then . I 'll find out what . Shaider ! Oh , Gavan ... What are you in such a hurry for ? I 've finally got a lead on someone I 've been chasing down for a while . Karasuma Shuu Space Sheriff I 've finally got a lead on someone I 've been chasing down for a while . Karasuma Shuu Space Sheriff Let 's knock some back soon . Sharivan can treat us . Karasuma Shuu Space Sheriff He 's way too cheap , always trying to add up - He 's way too cheap , always trying to add up - Yeah , usually , but he 's gonna be getting the commissioner 's award . - Sharivan ? - Yeah . Don 't wanna talk about it too loudly ... BUT IT SEEMS HE 'S IN A SECRET MISSION INVOLVING THE NEO-MADOU ! See you . You 're as loud as you are huge ! Sharivan 's on a secret mission ... ? At that time , Space Sheriff Sharivan , Hyuuga Kai , was on his way to Earth , with Space Forensic Scientist Shishii . Hyuuga Kai Space Sheriff was on his way to Earth , with Space Forensic Scientist Shishii . Hyuuga Kai Space Sheriff The Galactic Union Police had received a tip that General Guyler would be selling Hyper-M on Earth . Hyuuga Kai Space Sheriff The Galactic Union Police had received a tip that General Guyler would be selling Hyper-M on Earth . The Galactic Union Police had received a tip that General Guyler would be selling Hyper-M on Earth . Shishii Space Forensic Scientist The Galactic Union Police had received a tip that General Guyler would be selling Hyper-M on Earth . Shishii , did you memorize the basics for Earth ? Of course ! Gourmet of the World I 've got this down , too ! Gourmet of the World I 've got this down , too ! You don 't need any pointless trivia . My estimates say we won 't have time to waste going out to eat . Y 'know , the ladies hate guys who are all business nonstop ! Our course is set . We 're heading out . SHARIVAN SPACE SHERIFF Sharivan and Shishii met up with another Space Sheriff duo on Earth . They will be working together to stake out the Hyper-M deal . Yo , Kai ! Mekatoya . These two are both from the planet lga . The planet that was restored 30 years ago by the original Sharivan , lga Den . What 'd he say ? Mekatoya is a word from our mother language ... It means " long time no see ! " You 're Shishii , right ? I 'm Seigi , I usually work out of planet Bayashiya in the 6th Galaxy . Seigi Space Sheriff I 'm Seigi , I usually work out of planet Bayashiya in the 6th Galaxy . Seigi Space Sheriff Nice to meet you . You 're old friends with Sharivan ? Why didn 't you tell me ? I estimated the conversation would go on too long if I mentioned it . Didn 't want to waste the time . He 's been like this since we were kids . You haven 't changed a bit ! Seigi ... Do you remember what Den said ? " What does it mean to be a Space Sheriff ? " You mean that ? Have you found an answer ? Well , in my own way . What about you ? To act with flawless judgment based on accurate calculations . I think that 's the answer . This is my assistant , Ms. Aileen . Aileen Space Sheriff This is my assistant , Ms. Aileen . Aileen Space Sheriff I call her " the intellectual cool beauty . " I call her " the intellectual cool beauty . " I 'm Hyuuga Kai . Nice to meet you . Let 's start the briefing . There she goes ... You should at least introduce yourself ! Ow ! Don 't touch me . Are you okay ? ! Did she hurt you , Shishii ? Do you need help up ? - Ow ... - Sorry about that ! Kai was trying to read Aileen 's expression at the time . The truth was , he had received special orders , unknown to Shishii . This is top secret information ... There seems to be a Neo-Madou spy operating within the Galactic Union Police . After an investigation , a single officer seems most likely ... Kai 's secret mission : Discover proof as to whether or not Aileen was a Neo-Madou spy . Guyler 's customer this time is Gamagon , with the Space Mafia . This goes without saying , the first thing we need to do is confirm the deal . Okay ? Roger ! Then , we move in all at once , and bring them in . One of us should go in first ... I 'd estimate that 'd give a higher chance of success . Estimates , huh ? Well , for now , we all move . Guardbeast ... ? Who 's he ? A Hell Beast that acts as Guyler 's bodyguard . But we can worry about him later . Our main targets are Guyler and Gamagon . Shishii , the forensic scientist , remained aboard the Grand Birth while Kai , Seigi , and Aileen headed to warehouse 03 , where the deal was to take place . I 'm sorry Aileen ... But I need to pee ! Unbelievable ... You have ten seconds . Roger . Roger that ... Guardbeast , there 's no telling how this 'll go down . So take a bullet for me if it comes to that ... Got it ? Understood . There they are . Soffy ... Alright , alright ... How 's it going , Guyler ? Pretty well , Gamagon . Let 's get down to business ! Here 's the merchandise . And this stuff really works ? Want a demonstration ? Huh ? It doesn 't hurt at all ! Do it again ! Kidnap a few broads and kids , and you 'll be able to mass-produce unkillable super-soldiers ! - Dammit ... ! - You idiot ! Crap ! Space Sheriffs ? ! Police ! Don 't move ! You handle the rest ... Slaughter ' em ! You 're not getting away ... Don 't move ! Get over there ! The drug ... too strong ... ! E on ! Space Sheriff Sharivan can complete his Red Flash Electroplating in one millisecond . Let 's take a closer look at the Red Flash process . The explosive solar energy used is amplified and ignited by Grand Birth 's systems and is then converted into red solar metal Red Flash ! and is then converted into red solar metal and is then converted into red solar metal which then electroplates to Sharivan 's body . Space Sheriff , Sharivan ! Crime Buster ! You 're not getting away . Found you ! Bring it on ! Come on , get some , bring it on ! The finish ! Transplate ! Space Sheriff , Estevan ! Space Sheriff Estevan can complete his Transplating in just one millisecond ... But , I bet you guys aren 't interested in the process behind it , huh ? Laser Blade ! Estevan Aggression ! Not bad , you dirty punk ! How long have you been a Space Sheriff ? Why are you asking ? ! Because you seem like a rookie ! Sharivan Kick ! You had better not think it 'll be easy ! I have this ! Genmu Space Generator , activate ! Genmu Space is contained within a white hole . Matter that is drawn into this black hole is then broken down into atoms and reassembled in reverse polarity . It is a demonic realm filled with harsh light and fire . Genmu Space ? ! But Overlord Psycho is dead ... so how - ? ! Within Genmu Space , Hell Beasts have their powers multiplied up to four times ! Shishii , can you analyze what this Genmu Space is ? I already am , but all I can say for now is that it 's not stable ... It 's as if it 's only a fabrication . That switch must be behind this . I 'm going to grab it ! I need you to use the Birth Beam ! What ? ! We can 't use high energy weapons while we don 't know how that space is being generated ! It could cause an explosion with you inside ! I 've already accounted for that . It 's 100 % not going to be a problem . Well ... if you say so ! Grand Birth ! Battle Formation ! Birth Beam ! You 're under arrest . I still have this ! What 's wrong ? I didn 't account for that ... The switch must have malfunctioned . I 'll worry about the switch , you should go meet up with Seigi . You 're a real handful , but I think we 're about done here ! Laser Bla - Hang on ! Aileen ? ! Your sword won 't work on him ! He 's dead . Nicely done , Aileen . Just like always ! Bang ! Your mistake cost us catching them during the deal ! Wipe off that stupid grin ! S ... Sorry . Sharivan , did you arrest Gamagon ? There was an unanticipated explosion ... and he died . It would 've been nice if you had accounted for that . More importantly , when we made our move ... Guyler seemed to expect company . Do you think the details of the investigation had been leaked ? Where is Guyler , exactly ? Unfortunately , I lost him . Oh , really ? We 've received an update ... On the third planet in the Sol system , Earth , a Hyper-M deal between Neo-Madou and the mafia was stopped by the Galactic Union Police . Neo-Madou 's Guardbeast was shot in the encounter , and Gamagon , the mafia representative , died in an accident before being arrested . Gamagon 's dead ! In preparation for Neo-Madou 's next move , Sharivan and his team remained on Earth . The flowers and the birds ... Quietly whisper ... Raise your head , and take a look ... Towards the sky ... This world began ... On a tearful day long ago ... And as you dream of this world ... I can see you smile . That takes me back . It wasn 't that long ago . It 's a song from our homeworld . Really ? Shishii should have lunch done . Let 's debrief while we eat . Aileen ... There 's something that 's bothering me ... Where 's Guard beast 's body ? What about it bothers you ? It 's just a tiny thing ... Better to be safe than sorry . Well , I 'll take you to see it later . Go ahead and eat for now . I see ... fair enough . Almost done ! Let the others know . Looking good ... Did you hear me , Sharivan ? Shishii , could you examine Guardbeast 's body ? Something about it 's bothering me . I thought you wanted me to look into those switches and the Genmu Space they - No , this is different , I need you to check Guardbeast . Okay ! Well , after - Now ! Please . Now ? Right now . - What about lunch ? - I can take it to them . - No , I mean my - - I 'm counting on you . Dang it ! Thanks for the meal ! Hey ... you didn 't measure out the steak , did you ? What do you mean ? Well , when we were kids , we 'd see who could eat fastest ... And he would always weigh the food down to the milligram to make sure it was the same . ... Really ? Of course . If I won with an unfair advantage , it wouldn 't feel right . This guy 's whole philosophy is to calculate out a fight and win on those estimations . He 's a real pain ! Shut up , man . Calculations , huh ? Are you sure that 's all you should count on ? What 's wrong ? Nothing ... but Den said the same thing to me once . Den ? You mean the lga Den ? He trained us . He wore the Sharivan combat suit before me . Stay back ! When we were still just starting out ... During a patrol , we ran into a galactic serial killer on the run ... Put it down ! He took a hostage , and demanded I drop my gun ... But I didn 't do it . I calculated my chances of taking him in were better if I kept it . Don 't you care what happens to her ? ! Please ... ! 5 meters ... disarm with the first shot , release the hostage with the second , immobilize the target with the third ... There . Just like I calculated . Your gun doesn 't work on me ! Quit screwing with me ! Are you okay ? ! Hurry , run ! Thank you ! You son of a - ! Red Flash ! Sharivan Kick ! Why didn 't you drop your gun ? My chance of success would 've dropped significantly ... I ... estimated that I could take the perpetrator down without dropping it . And look what happened ! I 'm sorry , sir ! Our perp has a unique body that 's immune to firearms . Did either of you know that ? ! I didn 't ... calculate for that . Calculations ? Do you only want to be counting on your calculations ? What does it mean to be a Space Sheriff ? Right now , neither of you could ever become a true Space Sheriff . Why , sir ? ! You have to find that answer yourself . Did you ever find an answer ? Yes . I did . To gain experience , to make more accurate calculations ... That 's what makes a first-rate Space Sheriff . You 've still a ways to go . I understand what Den meant about you . What do you mean ? Reality is more than just calculations . No way ... What do you mean , exactly ? I mean ... you seem really different today , Aileen . Do I ? Hey . What are you staring at ? I don 't care if you fall for her , she 's my partner ! What 's wrong ? I can 't cut into Guardbeast 's subcutaneous tissue at all ... There 's no stiffness or discolorationrtis ... Are you doing an autopsy on Guardbeast ? ! Aileen ? ! Move ! Aileen ... ? - What are you - - I said move ! Aileen ... Are you okay ? ! Shishii , what happened ? Aileen ... took Guardbeast ... What 's going on ? Aileen is a Neo-Madou spy . What ... ? I was given special orders to prove her connection to them . Most likely , what she did was fire something to shut down most of his higher functions and put him in a near-death state . Aileen 's a spy ... ? ! That can 't be ... Ways for her to exit the ship ... The fastest would be ... It can 't be , Aileen ... Why ... ? How could you do this ... ? Go on ! Okay ... I 'll meet you on the roof ... Aileen ! You really are the Neo-Madou spy . Did you come to that conclusion off you calculations ? The theory wasn 't mine ... But you 're right about the calculations . I 'm taking you in ! Wait ! Listen , Sharivan - Keep your hands up ! It 's okay ! Look out , Kai ! Seigi ... Aileen 's a spy ... My Aileen ... was a spy ... ! I see ... I was hoping we were wrong , but ... Aileen 's currently unconscious in our medical bay . What about Seigi ? The psychological damage ... seems severe . I see ... Let Seigi know he should take some time off . Yes , sir . How could this happen ... ? Yeah ... 'ZZZ I don 't know if I can keep doing this , Kai ... I trusted her ... What the hell is a Space Sheriff , anyway ? ! I think I might not have any real idea , either . The truth is ... when Den was promoted , and stopped working in the field ... He said something to me . I heard ! You 're going to be taking up the title of Sharivan ? Yes , sir . I 'll work hard to live up to it . You 've got a great record . Perfect marks in everything . I found it . Being a Space Sheriff ... means fighting to apprehend criminals based on perfect calculations . That 's it , right ? I 'm afraid I can 't accept you as a Space Sheriff just yet . Den still hasn 't accepted me ... as Sharivan ... I 'm sorry . It 's okay . Just get some rest . Sharivan , come here , quick ! Some of the samples I took from Guardbeast have reverted to human cells ! What does that mean ? Guardbeast ... might have originally been human . What ? ! Then back there ... It looked like she was going to pull a gun ... But could it have been something else ? Who is this ... ? What is it ? I ... may have made a big mistake . Aileen ... might not have been the spy . What do you mean ? Shishii , I need you to look into something for me . Seigi Galactic Union Police HQ Seigi Aileen ? Aileen was shot under suspicion of being a Neo-Madou spy ... And is currently on the brink of death . Did you shoot her , Sharivan ? ! I want to meet you . We need to talk . Why 'd you shoot Aileen ? ! Why ? ! It happened too fast ... I couldn 't stop him . I 'm sorry , Sir . You found out who I am ... ? Guardbeast 's DNA matched the DNA of an officer who was listed as KIA . Aileen 's former partner ... Gencer35 } Space Sheriff Aileen 's former partner ... Aileen 's former partner ... A Space Sheriff who died while infiltrating the mafia undercover ... Gencer . That 's who you really are , isn 't it ? Your death was announced publicly to solidify your cover ... While you infiltrated the Neo-Madou in secret . Yes ... You were the one who provided the intel about the Hyper-M deal happening on Earth . And at the scene of the deal , you and Aileen were in contact . You 're right . If my cover was blown , Guyler would have killed me ... It was a special , top-secret mission . The only one who knew was Aileen , my secretary . That 's why Commissioner Gordon didn 't know ... Still ... That body ... I volunteered to be remade into this . It was the only way to reliably get close to the Neo-Madou boss . Are you sure about this ... ? Yeah . It 's fine . These are animals who sell drugs to kids and steal their futures ... All for their own greed . Gencer ... like Gencer , it also appears to be a rare name ? ! ) But ... why did you have to go so far ? Because I 'm a Space Sheriff . Some people might think it 's stupid ... But I will keep fighting to protect the ordinary happiness of ordinary people ! They might not be strong ... But they yearn for peace , and I do it for them ! Hang on ... If Aileen isn 't the spy ... Then who is it ... ? ! Oh , no ! We have an update . The supplier in the Neo-Madou / Space Mafia drug deal , General Guyler , is still at large . Additionally , it is suspected that two or three of the Space Sheriffs assigned to this case have died in the line of duty . Good work . Here 's to a cooperative future ... Keep us informed about the investigation , okay ? Sure . Leave it to me . However ... it couldn 't hurt to quadruple my pay . You 're one bad guy ... You 're the Neo-Madou spy , Seigi ... Kai ... ? ! How are you alive ? Gencer ... saved me . It 's up to you ... Get them ... for me ... Seigi ... You left the scene of the deal , so that you could contact him . I need to pee ! Guyler . We 're about to move in ... I 'll screw up on purpose , so grab the cash and get ... out ... quick . Roger that ... And to ensure that Aileen would die while being suspected of being a spy ... You pretended to protect me , and shot her . Wait ! Listen , Sharivan - You pretended to protect me , and shot her . Wait ! Listen , Sharivan - Keep your hands up ! - It 's okay ! - Look out , Kai ! Then you planted a bug in the Grand Birth 's medical bay ... What the hell is a Space Sheriff , anyway ? ! ... to keep aware of what I was doing . I want to meet you . We need to talk . When I met with Gencer on that rooftop , you were watching ... But I will keep fighting to protect the ordinary happiness of ordinary people ! And when you thought I realized what you had done , you tried to kill us with a bomb ! You really do know me well ! I don 't at all ! Why ... ? How 'd it come to this , Seigi ? No matter how hard we try , there 'll always be evil in the universe ! Because human nature ... is evil . When I realized that , my eyes were open ... If you turn to evil , then being a Space Sheriff is the juiciest job imaginable . That ... is your answer , Seigi ? Sure is ! You should join up with me , Kai . Don 't look at me like that ... Did you find your answer , is that it ? Yeah ... I finally understand . What a real Space Sheriff is ... Then tell me . No ! You ... can think about it while you rot in a cell for life ! Screw you . Get him . Slaughter ' em ! Nice work . But ... with a little Hyper-M , they 'll all be back on their feet . Crime Buster ! You 'll pay-J I 'll drag you into Genmu Space !

I went back to the Grand Birth and brought her along . I didn 't know you were such trash ... ! Come on ! Put the gun down and undo your Red Flash ! She 's dead meat , otherwise . It 's the same as before ... If I don 't undo my Red Flash , I 've got a 90 % chance of survival ... If I do ... Zero , huh ? Worse odds than before ... But ... Unlike before , I know the right answer . What 's wrong ? ! Hurry up , already . Don 't worry about me , take him out , Sharivan ! Aileen ... According to my calculations , if I don 't power down , there 's a 100 % chance he shoots you . It doesn 't matter ! Do it ! No . Reality ... is more than just calculations , right ? There we go ! Let me teach you something ... Winning is the only thing that matters . You can spout whatever idealistic crap you want , but if you lose , it doesn 't matter ! Sharivan !

Resting ... on your knees ... Dummy . The antidote is working ... Getting to him as quickly as I did and my research on Hyper-M made enough of a difference . Having a genius scientist for a partner saved his life . Nice one ! He 'll be waking up soon . Sharivan ... Kai . You 've been through a lot ... I need to borrow the thing you recovered . It 's going to be a big clue for my investigation . After interrogating Guyler , Gavan discovered something terrifying . It 's a website ... " Horror Girl 's Room . " When you look at it ... It makes you feel like you 're a Madou enforcer ... Horror Girl ? You should join the Makuu ! The copycats had all visited the same website . And they were all being manipulated by it 's administrator . Lizard Doubler and Gamagon were determined to have acted in the same fashion ... Gavan realized that Horror Girl ... was the prime suspect behind the propagation of the copycat crime rings . And this switch was from that website , too ? Yeah ... They send you the blueprints ... If ... you ... agree to work with her ... This is so much fun ! M e katoya . Den ... I heard you went a little nuts out there . Shishii got really angry with me about it ... Still going to keep making calculated moves ? Yes . I 'll keep trying to make the right estimates ... But ... But ? I 'm not going to rely only on calculations from now on . I see ... I 'm going to keep fighting for the sake of others . Well , good luck , Space Sheriff ... Sharivan ! Space Sheriff Sharivan was able to dismantle the Neo-Madou organization . And in the shadows lies the one who mind-controlled them into pretending to be Madou ... Horror Girl , the mastermind . The case was not closed yet . What does it mean to be a Space Sheriff ? Keep those feelings in your heart as you journey onward , Kai ! The stronger someone is , the kinder their smile Keep those feelings in your heart as you journey onward , Kai !

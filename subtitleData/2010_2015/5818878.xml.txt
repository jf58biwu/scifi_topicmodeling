 Previously on " The Lottery " ... The first viable human embryo in six years . One hundred human eggs have been successfully fertilized . - What do you suggest ? - A lottery . Let every woman out there have a chance to hit the jackpot . You , the people , will vote for the one hundred best mothers . Lottery finalist number 88 ... Perry sommers . Number two hundred ... Angela Maria Perez , The eyes of the world are upon you . History has chosen you . Anything you say or do is being transmitted live to the American people . Son of a bitch ! Come on ! - It 's all right . - Is it ? I don 't even want a baby . What 's this contestant 's name ? What do you want from me ? I just want to chat . This panel has decided to terminate the parental rights of the father . Elvis Walker is now a ward of the state . Why the hell are you following me ? ! I 'm a part of the Maytwos . Kyle Walker ... welcome . There was one address he visited a few times ... Crystal City . I see you 've met my daughter . So , uh ... Where are you staying ? At my dad 's apartment in Crystal City . We have to remove obstacles . Are you talking about the president ? I 'm talking about the future . Y-you 're saying my father is connected to the fertility crisis ? We think the government is responsible for the crisis . Fertility crisis ? Yes . You 're saying the United States government is behind the global fertility crisis ? Yes . And you have actual proof ? We can tie the government to Heliogenics . That 's the company that was funding the infertility research Kessler was doing . Do you know who was involved ? Do you have names ? You mean like Darius Hayes ? Yes . Can you tie him to this ? Not yet . But I know he was involved . He 's been covering something up all along . Look , if ... if we want to take him down , we need hard evidence . It 's got to be bulletproof . Dig in to everything you have ... Your files , Heliogenics . Try to connect Darius . And if he finds out what we 're up to ... you 'll protect us ? I will . But don 't let it come to that . And don 't breathe a word of this to anyone ... no one . Wait . Where are you going ? I need to figure out what Darius is going to do next . This is fantastic . I couldn 't be more thrilled . Again , thanks so much for letting me do this . Oh , I trust you 'll handle it the right way . Welcome , everyone . I 'm Jack Kerr , and I have your ticket to the hottest show in the country ... the lottery . With the guidance of our lovely and gracious first lady , Gabrielle Westwood , we 'll go behind the scenes of this historic event . Thank you , Jack . So nice to see you . And welcome , America . Tonight you 'll get a better idea of what our contestants are experiencing . Now , I have no doubt that among these two hundred women , we will be able to find one hundred wonderful , loving mothers . Who those one hundred are ... well , that 's up to you , the people . That 's great . We 'll use that as the cold open . - Okay . - Are you ready for your interview ? Sure . Yeah , I got the address . I 'll be there shortly . Are you serious ? You 're gonna join the Maytwos ? I 'm going to have a conversation with them . They are not good people . Look , they 're taking a stand against the " D of H " . They are bombing testing centers . They 're the only ones out there who are willing to get my son back . Is that what they told you ? And you believed them ? I 've been to lawyers . I 've been to judges . I 've tried every legal method . I 've been playing by the rules , but the game is rigged . My son is in an institution , a damn prison . And if they can help me get him out , I 'm in . I get it . But it 's not that simple . Nobody does anything for free . They are going to use you . And I 'm gonna use them . It 's a relationship . People use each other . So , you think this is the right venue ? The lottery event ? The only way that people will demand fundamental change is if we create a public outrage , induce shock so they 'll feel vulnerable and exposed . Then we 'll have control . Darius , as you might imagine , his protection will be extreme , historic even . That 's why we need to breach his security . He 'll be an easier target . Forcing them to evacuate . Improves our odds . Yeah , but it 's not that easy . Their extraction plan will be highly classified . Let 's talk to the secret service , see what they 'll tell us . Did you talk to our friend ? I have . His on board ? I think so . I 'll know more soon . What is that ? It 's a fertility doll . I brought it back from Ghana . Does it work ? Well , that 's what the clerk told me in the souvenir shop ... Once she found out I was Vice President . Good . We need all the help we can get . We 're announcing the one hundred winners of the lottery on Friday . It 's a big gala event . I hear it 's gonna be quite a party . Oh , yeah . Darius and Langdon are meeting with the secret service to review the security measures . I want you to sit in and make sure they don 't hijack it . What are we talking about , Tom ? Sit down . Darius is gonna try and turn this event into a military operation . Make sure he doesn 't . I don 't want the American people staring at a bunch of armed soldiers and tanks . We 're trying to inspire hope , not fear . Don 't worry , Tom . I can handle Darius . We met before , right ? Yeah , last Summer , I think . At church ? No . At a party . Agent Kent said you could help me out . All I need is a photo and a start point . Just so you know , the person I want you to follow is a high-ranking member of government . Well , unless it 's my mother or father , I don 't really care . It 's Darius Hayes . Can you do this ? Sure . Planning the revolution ? Have a seat , Kyle . We don 't invest in furniture here . Security dictates we move every nine days . Nice . You 've set up a temporary mesh system to cloak your communications . You know about these things . I did duty in Venezuela ... Tactical . You 're gonna fit right in . Look , I get what you stand for . You hate the government . But what do you actually do here ? Our mandate is to disrupt the infrastructure of the current government . We work with very powerful people . They have lots of money . They have lots of connections . But they don 't like getting their hands dirty . You do ? Whenever it 's necessary . Last time we spoke , you told me that you could help me get my son back . - We can . - How ? We 've got topos ... Um ... moles ... Inside of the " D of H " , very close to your son . How do I know you 're telling me the truth ? It 's a game of trust . And you and I are both playing . I don 't play games . You give me a picture of my son wearing this mask , I 'll do whatever it is you want . The state department 's picking up credible chatter around the lottery announcement . Specifically , this Maytwos underground group may be planning something . So , now we 're worried about a bunch of beatniks with computers ? It would be a mistake to underestimate them . Then let 's not . Are you prepared in case something happens that night ? We are . But the specific security measures are confidential . I understand , but given the role the department of humanity is playing in this event , I think it 's imperative we get on the same page so there are no disruptions . We don 't want troops or tanks . This thing should look like a celebration , not a war zone . That doesn 't mean we can pretend there are no security risks . So , if you wouldn 't mind , I 'd really appreciate if you dropped the formalities and gave us a little more insight into the plan . I 'm afraid I can 't do that . Like I said , that 's confidential . We 're just trying to help out here , Ted . I certainly would be willing to work with you on this . We can provide troops . We can provide tanks . I said no tanks . No tanks . We certainly could help with the emergency extraction plan . Well , I 'd have to run that by my superiors . Uh , Ted , in case you 've forgotten , I am one of your superiors , also one of the people who would need to be extracted , so ... Sir , I work for the president , not you . No offense , but you have your own security team . You better watch your tone with me , son . That 's great . All right , let 's ... Let 's get honest here , madame first lady . Oh , that sounds ominous . No , I just ... I want to get inside your head a little bit . What 's it like to be a woman on the other end of the age requirement ? You 're 38 , correct ? Yes . I just turned 38 a month ago . So you 're too old to be part of the lottery , but you 're still young enough to have a baby . What 's that like ? Well , to be perfectly Frank , it 's difficult . Like a lot of women my age , I pursued a career , thinking motherhood would always be there waiting for me when I was ready for it . But it wasn 't . But the lottery 's not about me . Nor is it about women over the age of 32 . It 's about the future . It 's about ushering in the next generation . I know this is hard , but deep down , in the quiet of the night , you think you 'll be a mother someday ? You wanted to see me ? Yes . The president has made his decision about the lottery winners . After the implantation of the embryos , the women will be free to go home . We , of course , will work with local and state police and secret service to provide security . But otherwise , they 'll be free to lead normal lives . Good . I 'm glad you 've come around . I have a daughter . I know what it 's like to worry about their choices , their future . These one hundred women deserve to be treated well . They need their families . We appreciate your support . I will abide by whatever decision the president makes . I don 't know anything about Heliogenics , okay ? My ... my father never talked about what he was working on . Like I told you before , he was never very ... communicative , but I do remember he was pretty stressed out toward the end . Before the plane crash . Mark , we think your father was researching the effects of global overpopulation and that his experimen might be tied to the fertility crisis . A-a-are you saying he 's responsible for all of this ? All we know for sure is that the company he worked for was owned by the C.I.A. And that the site of the plane crash ... Kabul ... Was ground zero in the crisis . We 're not saying that your father caused the fertility crisis , but we do believe he knew it was coming . Okay , so , what do you want from me ? Did he leave anything behind , maybe papers or a ... Like a zip drive or anything ? Anything . It 's been eight years . There must be something . I don 't know . Okay ? Now , if you 'll excuse me , I ... I just want you to leave me the hell alone . Mm . So , you really think running off to Paris is gonna solve all your problems ? I 'm just going there to have fun . Well ... You 're 22 years old . The party 's not gonna last forever . It 's time to focus on your life , what you 're doing . What am I supposed to do , just stay here and go drink cheap wine at lottery viewing parties ? There will be other options . The idea was you 'd stay here in D.C. And make a plan for the future . Yeah , well , I have thought about the future , and ... news flash ... It ain 't that great . Come on , Rose . Stay a little longer . We 'll have fun . You 've never really been the " have fun " type . Well , give me a chance . I might surprise you . I got to take this . Sorry . Yeah ? He 's in ? Well , that 's good . I hope he can deliver . We need him . We can 't pull this off without him . I 'll take care of it . Hey , Rose . Rose ? Rose ? Hello , Perry . How are you ? Good , I guess . You 're doing better than good , actually . The people watching at home really like you . You 're trending really high . That 's cool . But , um , I 'm guessing the other day ... The guitar , the extra perks ... Comes with strings , right ? What do you want ? You don 't really want to be a mother , do you ? Excuse me ? Come on . Be honest . There 's no cameras out here . You can tell me . I get the feeling you did this on a bit of a lark , maybe hoping to get famous . I don 't know what to say . Well , you don 't have to say anything . Raising a child is hard , especially for a young , single mom . Maybe I can help . That 's all . Okay , why dou head back inside ? I told Jack Kerr to interview you first . Just keep being honest ... But not too honest . Now , for the first time , we 're actually gonna meet some of the lottery finalists . Let 's start with you ... Perry Sommers from Brenham , Texas . How has the experience been for you so far , Perry ? Exciting and insane . Good insane . Are you married ? Please . I have enough trouble dating . So , ar ... e you saying you 're gonna raise the baby all by yourself ? Yes . But I 'm pretty resourceful . I have lots of friends . I know they 'd be willing to help out . What about your family ? My sister lives in Georgia with her husband , and my mother lives in Brenham , near me . So , you 're close with your mother ? We see each other a lot , but we 're not super close . Let 's just say motherhood was not her specialty . What was ? Making dumb men fall in love with her . I had someone follow Darius . He saw them together an hour ago . He sent me the photos . Ran them through our facial-recognition program . Right . So , why would Darius be talking to a professional sniper ? In theory there are many reasons , in reallity cause he wants to kill someone who isn 't easy to kill . Then we need to act quickly , connect Darius to all this before he makes a move . Just be careful . We 've had enough funerals . Mr. Vice President . Good to see you 're back in town . Ted Thompson ... He 's the head of the president 's security team , correct ? Yes . He 's a good man . He is an arrogant little prick . Excuse me ? I just met with him , general Langdon , and Darius Hayes . We were reviewing the security plan for the upcoming lottery announcement . And ? He talked to me like I was a subordinate . I asked about the evacuation plan . He pretty much told me to mind my own business . Now , Andy , I 'm a reasonable man . You know that . But I will not have some secret service agent pull down my pants in front of people like Langdon and Darius Hayes . Do you understand what I 'm saying ? I 'll handle it . I have your word on that ? Yes . Ted Thompson , please . This will be painless , I prise . I 've never been on camera before . So , Angela , I had a chance to read the bio you suplied , and your interests were long walks with your fiancée and religion . Yes . Our faith is very strong . Are you ... are you saving yourself for marriage ? Yes . A virgin who could possibly be impregnated within a few weeks ... The ... the parallels here are fascinating . Yes , I agree . But I would never compare myself to her . I have a little surprise for you , if you look at the monitor . We 're waiting for you to come home , baby . And don 't think I haven 't been missing you . Te amo . We all miss you . Oh , and take a look at this . They don 't even sell these anymore , but I 've been searching ever since you left , and I found one . It 's a sign . I love you , baby . I 'll see you soon . So , as you can see , these guys are ready for you - to win this thing . - I 'm ready , too . Do you think being religious will make you a better mother ? Um , I don 't know . I-I 'm not sure . But I know that I love children and God . So , I 'm hoping that it will give me the strength to deal with the hard times . - So , you think it 'll help . Good . - Yes . Does that mean you think that women who aren 't religious would be bad mothers ? Y ... uh ... Wait . What ? Uh , no , I didn 't say that . Okay , good . I just wanted to make sure . Religion 's such a tricky subject these days . Best of luck to you , Angela . Get ready , folks . We may be on the verge of witnessing another immaculate conception . Hey , sweetie . It 's me . I haven 't heard from you . Neither has your mother . We need to know where you are . I 'm worried . So call me , please . You talk to the secret service ? No , not yet . But I have a plan in motion . We 'll see how it plays out . Better play out soon . Landry 's good , but he 's not aagician . He needs details . I understand that . Like I said , I 'm working on it . I 'm gonna meet our friend later today . For the sake of argument , what if he doesn 't come through ? What if we don 't get the information we need ? What then ? What 's plan " b " ? Plan " b " ? There is no plan " b " . We 're trying to kill the damn king . Everything has to be perfect . I watched your interview . How 'd I do ? You were honest , which is admirable , and funny , which is endearing . So , what 's the problem ? I can tell you think I screwed up . People judge mothers differently . What 's charming for a cocktail waitress isn 't necessarily charming for a mother , especially these days . If you want to win , lose the act . It 's not an act . It 's who I am . I suggest you pretend to be somebody else . Have you given any moreught to our prior conversation ? A little . And ? I 'm not sure . It 's not an easy choice . Who knows if I 'll even win ? There 's a test later today . It 's an important part of the evaluation process . It 's designed to identify emotional and psychological stability . I 'll do my best . I 'd rather not leave it to chance . Like I said , it 's an important part of the process . Are they treating him all right ? My people inside are trying alleviate some of his anxiety , but , uh ... What 's next ? How do we get him the hell out of there ? I 'll need to talk to some of my people , see what they suggest . - It won 't be easy . - I know . I 'll do whatever it takes . Good . In the meantime , um I need you to do something for me . Name it . You 're living with Dr. Lennon , correct ? Yeah . I needed a place to stay . She 's letting me sleep on her couch . There 's nothing going on between us . I want you to clone her phone . What , you want me to spy on her ? Mm-hmm . She 's a gold mine . She 's the face of the lottery . She 's got access to all this valuable information . The more we know , the more we can accomplish . I know , but she 's a friend . I don 't feel comfortable doing that . Comfortable ? This is not about comfort . This is war . Look , let 's just cut the bullshit , okay ? If you want me to help you , you need to help me . Simple as that . Hey . What 's the matter ? I really messed up the interview . I started talking about religion , and that guy , Kerr , just made it sound like I only think that women that believe in god are good mothers . I bet you it 's not as bad as you think . It is . People watching are smarter than you think . What do you mean ? Everybody knows that reporters put words in your mouth . And if there 's one thing I 've learned from working in a bar , it 's that people can smell bullshit from a mile away . You 're genuine . People will hear what you meant to say , not what you actually said . You really think so ? I know so . So cheer up . Thank you , Perry . Hey , do you know how to do the Texas two-step ? No . Neither do I , but ... I imagine it goes something like this . Hey . Hey . Come on . You 're crazy . You know that ? All right , spin . And one , two , three . Kessler called back . Uh-huh . Apparently , his father had lots of notebooks . They 're in a closet at his family 's beach house . Sounds intriguing . Where 's the beach house ? St. Michael 's island . So I guess this means we 're finally gonna make our little trip to St. Michael 's island . It 's sort of ironic . You 're the one who never made it . I spent that weekend there alone . Boss wouldn 't let me get away . The reason you didn 't come is because you didn 't agree with my decision . I should have come . Hey , it 's okay . I get it . No , I should have ... I should have been there for you . I wanted to go , but I ... I just ... At least you paid for the beach house . Yeah . What a champ . But you 're right . It was my decision . I wasn 't ready to have a baby . You were . At least , you said you were . Who the hell knew there was a fertility crisis around the corner ? I always wondered what would have happened . If we had the baby ? If I 'd made it to St. Michael 's island . Truth is , we 're better off working together . That 's our destiny . And I wouldn 't trade it for anything . Neither would I. Dr. Kessler . A friend of mine would like to have a word with you . Don 't make me shoot you for no reason . No . Wait . I ... Welcome , ladies . Please prepare to take the psychology exam . Best of luck . I don 't know anything about psychology . Relax . It 's just common sense . Yeah , well , I 'm not very good at that . Sit here . Justo . What ? This is your chair . The answers are highlighted . Don 't ask why . Just do it . But get a few wrong so it doesn 't look like you cheated . You have 30 minutes . Good luck . I can 't let you leave . I need to get to Dr. Kessler 's . That 's the problem . Kessler just turned up dead . What ? I don 't know what the hell you 've been doing , but this is getting dangerous . You have upset some very powerful people , and my job is to keep you alive . Okay , well , if you 're worried , then come with us . Keep us safe . I need to get this information fast , before it disappears . I can 't let you go . - I 'll call your boss . - Go ahead . Vanessa is the one who told me to do this . James . I 've been trying to reach you for an hour . The reception 's been spotty . I 'm on my way out to the beach house . - Kessler 's dead . - What ? Then we have to get his father 's documents out . No . Vanessa 's right . It 's getting bad . We need to be careful . Okay . I guess I 'll head back . I 'll see you first thing Tomorrow morning . Okay . You switched places with your roommate . Angela was freaking out . I care about you , not Angela . Well , I think I did really good on that test , so there 's nothing to worry about . You may think I 'm some dumbass hillbilly , but I 'm smart . I know you 're smart . I just want the people voting to know you are , too . That 's why I offered to help . Don 't pull another stunt like that again . Understand me ? - Hello ? - I took photos . Good . Send them . What are you looking at ? Something good , I hope . Ugh . I wish . When you get a minute . Yes . I 'll be right there . So , we 're sure our emergency extraction plan is solid ? Yes , our ... our friend came through . Thank you for your hard work on this , Dan . No problem . I 'm the Vice President . That 's my job . I take it the new head of the president 's security team is a little more amenable . He 'll fall into line . Nothing to worry about there . For the record ... I 'm sorry it has to go down this way . I mean , Tom 's a good man . And I was hoping he 'd see the light . But I agree . He 's an impediment to the future of this country . I thought you went to Paris . I changed my md . Were you sleeping ? Yeah . It 's just been a long day . Hey . Hi . How did it go with the Maytwos ? You were right . They 're no bunch of boy scouts . But can they get your son back ? I think so . That 's great . What do they want in return ? They 're gonna ask for something . Yeah . I know . Be careful . Hey ... I get it . I know what it 's like to be exploited . Do you think I wanted to be the face of the lottery ? I didn 't have a choice . They made me . There 's so much manipulating and lying . How about this ? You and I ... We agree to be honest , tell each other the truth . It 'll make life so much easier . You have no idea how much I would like that . Bingo . Oh , beautiful .

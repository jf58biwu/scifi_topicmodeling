 I went to space on a 13-month solo mission . I didn 't come home alone . My husband created a lifelike android called a Humanich . His name is Ethan . He 's the prototype . This is a story about Earth . Ethan ! A story about family . A story about surviving . Previously on Extant ... - Turn around , hands in the air ! - Shh . He 's sleeping . Show her to me . Kryger reached out to me last night . He broke into the ISEA . I don 't know what he took . Why are you telling me all this ? Tell Sparks ; he 'll know what to do . Alan . It 's my nightmare . - Where did you see it ? - On your belly . - Absalom . Dose and a half . - He 's out . He stole the Aruna transmission file . I tried decoding it , but it wasn 't ISEA code . This is Katie Sparks from the Aruna Station . The virus has entered the ship . Uh ... Dad , I 'm gonna die up here . She was pregnant , too . He knew what was up there , and he sent me anyway . Capsule is 200 meters out . Range rate : 0.05 . Ben , you know what to do . Copy . Initiating final approach . Meteor collision . Functional cargo blocked . Escape vehicle damaged . Rapid oxygen loss . Leak detected . T-res to bingo pressure ? Two minutes , 15 seconds . Initiate de-press protocol . - Shutting IMV valves . - Securing the hatches fore and aft ! Equalizing available atmosphere . Ben ! If we isolated the leak , why is the alarm still ... ? Aah ! My ears ! We 're losing pressure ! Damn it , Ben , you said you shut the IMV valve ! The meteor collision must have caused a system malfunction . Enter manual override code . Okay . Come on . T-res one minute . - Come on . - Don oxygen mask . Aah ! Damn it , come on ! T-res 30 seconds . 29 , 28 ... Come on ! Twenty-s ... Leak isolated . Oxygen reserves active . Nice work , Molly . That was a close one . Yeah , I 'll say . Seriously ? A broken oxygen mask ? I know we got to be ready for anything , but come on . Nice , Molly . May I have your attention . This evening , at 6 : 54 p.m. , Mission Specialist Derek Pearce received a distress call from the Aruna Station , reporting an oxygen fire . Several minutes after the initial comm , an on board explosion disabled all contact between mission control ... and the Aruna crew . At this time , we believe ... We believe there are no survivors . Go home . Be with your families . We 'll provide more details as they become available . Alan . Alan . I 'm so sorry about Katie . If there 's anything I can do , I ... There 's nothing anyone can do . Whatever you do , do not recover the ship . I repeat ... do not recover the ship . Sparks knew about this . He knew this happened to his very own daughter . And he sent me up there anyway . Do you think he knew Katie was pregnant ? She didn 't even know she was pregnant . But he knew something was up there . And he sent me on a fishing expedition . And then you come back pregnant . That 's ... That 's how I know it 's still alive . Think about it , Sam . Why would they go through all this trouble just to abort the baby ? They 're keeping it somewhere , and when I find it , I 'm gonna be able to prove what they did to me . What Sparks did to me . Molly , they took that baby out of your body without leaving any physical evidence . I don 't know how you expect to be able to find it now . I 'm not going to find it . Sparks is gonna tell me exactly where it is . But why ? We can 't even prove that he saw the Aruna video . But somebody can . Derek Pearce . He was the Aruna mission specialist . He would have been the one to receive Katie 's distress call . And you think that he 'll admit that Sparks was behind this entire cover-up ? If he wants to save himself . I 'm gonna need your help . Anything . Okay . Go through the entire Aruna crew 's medical history . There had to be some major anomalies in the scans , the tether scores , something . Sparks would have had to sign off on anything unusual . You know if I go through those records , he 's gonna find out . Good . I want him to know I 'm up to something . I want him to lose sleep at night . Why ? I want to make him sweat . Evening , sir . Everything go as planned ? Not exactly . But I managed to locate the target . And ? Harmon Kryger won 't be causing us any more trouble . Were you able to recover the Aruna file ? No , sir . But I am working on a strong lead . - Morning . - Morning . Did you get any sleep ? Every time I closed my eyes , all I could see was ... Katie Sparks . Are you ready yet ? I don 't want to be late . School doesn 't start for an hour , E. We got plenty of time . - First day back . - He 's nervous . Mm . I don 't blame him . I mean , after all he 's been through since his shutdown ? Well , that 's exactly why he needs to go back . Ethan needs to spend some time around normal kids with a normal life . What 's that ? This ... is normal life . Look . A surprise for Ethan . It 's being delivered later . Are you ready yet ? In a minute , kiddo . Are you going to see Derek Pearce today ? Yup . The sooner he starts talking , the sooner Sparks 's nightmare begins . And ours ends . Hey . It has to end . Yeah . Search " Aruna . " I need the medical records from the final mission . Where 's the Aruna file ? I cou ... I could ... I couldn 't open it . So where is it ? Why would I keep it if I ... if I couldn 't open it ? Visitor . Back door . Mom . What are you doing here ? Well , I tried calling , and when you didn 't call back , I ... May I come in ? Of course . May I help you ? Derek . Hi . Molly Woods , from the ISEA . I 'm wondering if maybe we can talk ? About the Aruna ? Molly , uh ... Uh , I 'm kind of tied up right now . It 'll just take a second . I really can 't . Sorry . Okay . I 'm sorry . I didn 't know he spoke Japanese . Neither did I. Hey . Where 'd you learn to do that ? I don 't know . I wanted to thank you . Apparently , your information about Molly 's meeting with Harmon Kryger proved quite useful . Did it ? That 's good . I 'm glad to know you 're on board . On board ? Well , that you can be trusted to act in the best interest of this organization . And in your own best interest . Which , really , are one and the same , considering what 's at stake . Considering that ... - Yes . - One more thing : I noticed you were looking into the Aruna astronaut " medical records . Why is that ? Molly asked for them . And you gave them to her ? You said you wanted her to trust me again . What did she want them for ? I really don 't know , sir . Find out . And in the future , if Molly asks you for anything , anything at all , you 're to run it by me first . Understood ? Understood . What ? No , it 's not our second date . Please , if you think picking me up at the gym counts as a first date , there 's not gonna be a second one . Surprise me . Odin ? Maybe . - You okay ? - I 'm fine . - Why ? - God , your pupils have turned into cartoon hearts . - Shut up ! - They 're just beating right out - of your sockets . Cartoon ... - I think you know where you can shove that . " Surprise me . " Can anyone here tell me how Ethan suddenly speaks Japanese ? - What ? - This morning , I dropped him off at school , and he heard two Japanese girls talking about him . And he talked back in Japanese . All right , little man 's on fire . But the question is : what 's fueling that fire ? Well , his neural net 's programmed to basic Japanese . Yeah , but that 's not nearly enough to explain this . Linguistically , it 's-it 's like saying Ethan had a stepladder and-and used it to reach the moon . But maybe he doesn 't see it as linguistic but mathematical , like translation as code-breaking . - Yeah , he is good at that . - Maybe I was wrong . Maybe that school is good for Ethan . But at this rate , pretty soon he 'll be smarter than all of his teachers . Well , I mean , so was I. I turned out pretty good . But we designed Ethan to-to learn at the same rate as his peers . We sent him to school to learn like other kids , to-to learn to be like other kids . And other kids don 't just start speaking Japanese without being taught . Be cool if they did , though . No , it would be terrifying . It wouldn 't be human . I don 't get it . I built Ethan ; I-I thought I understood everything about him . Gina , look up the purchase price of Derek Pearce 's apartment . Seems a bit pricey for an ex-mission specialist . Especially one without a pension . That property was purchased for exactly one dollar . What ? One dollar ? Well , that can 't be . Check again . Derek Pearce . Grand Avenue . Penthouse A. He bought it for one dollar . Multiple property records confirm . From who ? Previous owner was Claypool Industries . Sending you a full purchase history now . Okay , well , according to this , Claypool Industries bought the property for $ 5.2 million , and then six days later , Pearce bought it for one dollar . So Claypool bought the property and then put it in Pearce 's name . Gina , look up Claypool Industries . One listing . Claypool Industries Mining and Ore . No current address . Why would a mining company buy a luxury apartment for Derek Pearce ? I 'm guessing that 's a rhetorical question . You could say that . Gina , compose e-mail . To Derek Pearce . What is Claypool Industries ? Message send . Incoming V-Chron from John . Open . So , uh , hey . This might seem weird , but did you , by any chance , teach Ethan to speak Japanese ? Uh , no . I only know a few words from my time on the I.S.S. Why ? Long story short , Ethan speaks Japanese . Out of nowhere . Charlie put it in the lab report , and now Yasumoto wants to see it for himself . At dinner . Tonight . With the three of us . Seriously ? Sorry . Okay . Thank you . I 'll see you later . Gina , compose e-mail . Derek Pearce . Subject : What is this ? Message send . New message . Open . I 'm concerned , Gordon . You haven 't answered my calls . You look awful . Your house is a mess . - Are you using again ? - What ? No . No , I 'm just ... working a lot . That 's what your dad said before ... He was exactly your age when he got sick , you know . I 'm not sick . Maybe neither was he . - What ? - Mom , what if Dad wasn 't crazy ? - What if he was right ? - Right ? What he did cost him and us everything . I don 't mean what he did . I mean what he believed . That the voice of God was speaking to him , telling him to land a commercial airliner in the middle of a cornfield , hundreds of miles off course ? He was sick , Gordon . He was very , very sick . It 's a miracle that people weren 't killed . A miracle , huh ? Maybe God was up there with him . Please . There 's more in Heaven and Earth than can be dreamt of in our philosophy . There 's no shame in it . Not in being sick . But if there were something wrong and you didn 't admit it , that would be a shame . I 'm fine . I 'm just worn out . Okay . I 'll go . I 'll let you get some rest . But promise me this : that if you do need help , you 'll ask for it . Dr. Barton arriving . - Sam . - Hey . I found something in the Aruna records . Okay , but I 'm on my way out . Pearce agreed to meet me . Molly , you got to see this . I checked the crew members ' brain scans . At first glance , they all look completely normal . Okay , on second glance ? They 're all exactly the same . Somebody must 've substituted the same scan across the board . But they didn 't touch the tethers , so look at this . The naphthalene levels were elevated to a man ... or a woman , in Katie 's case . - Naphthalene ? - We started testing for it after astronauts on the first mining missions started coming back with hemolytic anemia . But the Aruna wasn 't a mining mission . Well , it wasn 't supposed to be . Wait a minute . Pearce 's apartment was bought by a mining company ... Claypool Industries . Maybe buying his silence is what put them out of business . Why would they cover up the mining ? The ISEA partners with mining missions all the time . Because they didn 't want anybody to know what they were searching for . It must be pretty valuable . Not compared to what they found . Excuse me . Excuse me . Ma 'am , I 'm gonna have to ask you to step back . What happened ? Jumper from the penthouse . You 're sure there 's nothing you 're not telling me . You didn 't learn Japanese from a book or a translation app or something ? Maybe it came from the secret part of me . What ? The part that belongs only to me . There you are . We 'd better get going . I don 't want to be late to Yasumoto 's . Okay , Ethan . Go to the car . W-We 're gonna meet you there . What 's wrong ? What did Pearce say ? He 's dead . I think they killed him . What ? You mean because you were asking questions ? What-what happened ? He jumped . Or else he was pushed . Oh , God , John , I 'm scared . Th-This has to stop . That video is enough to bring Sparks down . But maybe it 's not . They made me look like I was crazy once . - They can do that again . - And putting yourself in danger like this , putting all of us in danger , that doesn 't seem crazy to you ? We-we can 't do this any longer . It 's too risky . Yeah , I know it 's risky . But no risk , no reward . Come on . Ethan 's waiting . Drink it . It 's just water . There 's more in Heaven and Earth . Damn right there is . I 've seen it . You 've seen it , too , haven 't you ? It 's hard to forget , huh ? I 'm sure the Absalom will help , for a while . You don 't know me . I know that you let Sparks think that you killed me . I know the fact that you haven 't means that you 've got doubts . - Watch it . - Real doubts . About Sparks . About what he did to Molly and to me . About what he 's asking you to do . I said watch it ! Damn it ! Hello again . Hello . Um ... you met Ethan . And , uh , this is my wife Molly . Hello . Hi . Come in . Please . Molly , this is , uh , Femi Dodd . She 's a board member at Yasumoto Corp. The first time we met , I , uh ... I called her an idiot . John . Welcome . Thank you . I-If I 'd known you two were , uh ... I definitely wouldn 't have called you an idiot . Apology accepted . You must be Molly . Mr. Yasumoto . I 've heard so much about you . And I about you . The possibilities are limitless . - No ? - Well , I 'm not sure I 'd say " limitless . " But making sense of the independent activity in Ethan 's brain could be a huge step toward understanding the nature of human consciousness . Right ? Not to mention a potential path to immortality . I-Immortality ? I don 't understand . I think Mr. Yasumoto is referring to the theory that once the neural pathways are fully decoded , it would be possible to copy a human brain and upload it to a Humanich 's body . So it 's possible , then ? Theoretically , but ... Just because we can do it does not mean we should do it . For once , I agree with Ms. Dodd . And anyway , to suggest that understanding Ethan 's cognitive leaps is akin to understanding human consciousness , it 's not just premature , it 's-it 's wrong . After all , human beings can 't learn a language in a single day , so Ethan shouldn 't be able to , either . I-I think we should install some sort of governing mechanism . What ? Slow down his development . But that goes against everything you 've ever said . So you think Ethan 's progress should be allowed to continue ? Well , I don 't know . But I do know that we 're not gods . We 're just parents . And all we can do is give him the best of ourselves . And then whatever happens happens , right ? - We just have to wait and see . - To " wait and see " is to expose Ethan to needless risk . Well , no risk , no reward . Yeah , it was tough when I was young , but ... these days the supers are so good , it 's ... I hardly even notice anymore . Yeah , well , I wish I could say the same . Well , it 's still new . It 'll get easier . So you 're not ... I don 't know ... resentful ? Honestly , I 'm ... I 'm almost grateful . If it wasn 't for my legs , I wouldn 't have started designing prosthetics , or gotten involved in the Humanichs Project . You love your work , huh ? Well , some days more than others . Yeah ? Today wasn 't one of those days ? It 's just my boss . He 's like ... threatened by progress all of a sudden . - You know what I mean ? - Yeah . Yeah , I do . And he lets his personal feelings cloud his professional judgment , which drives me insane . Sorry , we don 't have to talk about my dumb office drama . Oh , no , it 's okay . No . I like it . I 'd like to talk more about it actually . Really ? Sure . I mean , take Ethan . How do you guys ... how do you guys control him ? We don 't . Especially not lately . Actually the goal is to try to get him to start thinking for himself . So , you 're saying that someday he could have complete free will ? Can you imagine ? - We have to talk . - Not now . Now ! Pearce is dead . You could be next . If this is about taking Sparks down , you have what you need . It 's time to go public with the Aruna video and let the chips fall where they may . It 's about more than that . I want to see it . See what ? - The baby . - What ? Whatever it is , John , it 's half mine . It was inside of me . Not you . Me . I brought it here . And every indication is it 's still alive . I don 't believe this . And if it 's out there ... I 'm gonna find it . Dad ? I 'm gonna die up here . I just want ... Whatever you do ... do not recover the ship . I repeat ... do not recover the ship ! What kind of father sends his daughter into harm 's way like that , Alan ? And then lies and covers the whole thing up ? I know the Aruna was a secret mining mission , and that Claypool bought Pearce an apartment to keep him quiet . How much did they give you ? Well , enough to get Pearce killed , I guess , right ? What was his life worth ? And what about my baby ? How much did you get for that ? Careful , Molly . You 're out of your depth here . What about Katie 's baby ? Yeah . She was pregnant when she died . Just like I was . Guess you 're the one out of your depth here , Alan . What do you want ? I want to know where my baby is . I don 't know . But I can find it . No . I 'll find it . I got this far all by myself . Before you go to bed tonight ... get down on your knees and pray for Katie 's forgiveness . Tonight and every night for the rest of your life . It 's not nearly gonna be enough . But it 's gonna be worth a try . Hey , wh-what are you doing up ? Did Julie adjust your sleep cycle ? No . I just woke up . Is that for me ? Yeah . Will you teach me to ride it ? Sure , sure . We 're gonna take it for a spin in the morning . No . Now . Ethan , it 's dark out . We 'll-we 'll wait for morning . Please ? Well , screw it . Let 's go . Yes ! You want to come in ? Next time . Okay , I 'm gonna hold on to help you balance , but steering , pedaling ... that 's all you , okay ? - You think you can handle it ? - Yup . This is how my dad taught me , and I fell a lot . But I didn 't give up . Okay ? Okay . Remember ... keep your eyes straight ahead . Not down on the ground , okay ? Dad , let go . What ? Let go . Are you okay ? Yeah . Did you want to teach me more ? No . No . I mean , I-I did , but , uh ... I just want to watch you ride now . Ethan ? Ethan ! Ethan ! What 's wrong ? You can 't go off on your own like that . Sorry . Come on , let 's-let 's go back inside . It 's late . We must prepare ourselves for the battle ahead . There will be violence . Casualties . But I , for one , am ready to fight for a better world . That 's what I thought I was fighting for overseas . And then ... then the drone strikes began . See , I lost my arm in combat , but ... my opponent wasn 't on the battlefield . Uh-uh . He ... or she ... was sat in a nice , little air-conditioned room thousands of miles away , pushing buttons and watching the carnage unfold on-screen ! When we outsource war to machines , we outsource our humanity to technology . We have ... lost our souls to machines . We talk of making a difference , but so far that 's all it 's been : talk . Power outages and rolling blackouts ... these half-measures are wholly ineffective . We need more . We need a reckoning . Starting right here . Sorry I 'm late . Actually , your timing is perfect . Can I help you ? Yeah , um , I 'd like to go - to Claypool Industries . - Oh . Gone . - I-I know it 's late . - I 'm sorry , but ... - No , no . I mean , they 're gone . The fifth floor 's been empty since I started here . Okay , well , you know what ? Uh , the thing is , um ... I told my boss that I would take a look at all the empty offices . He 's expecting a full report from me first thing in the morning . So ... do you think I could take just a quick little peek upstairs ? I 'm really not supposed to leave my post . I know . I know you 're not . But I would be so grateful if you did . Okay , come on . Thank you . Katie . Katie , it 's me . Please , Katie . Please forgive me . You gotta believe me . I ... I had no idea . I 'm sorry . Oh , Katie , I 'm so sorry . Dad ? Katie ... All righty . Here we are . Take your time ; look around . I gotta get back downstairs . - Thanks . - All right . Security breach . Code Black . Threat currently isolated on five ; requesting backup . Hi , Daddy . Security breach , Code Black . Fifth floor . Repeat : security breach , Code Black , fifth floor . No ! You 've made a mistake ! I can help you . Yeah ? And how are you gonna help me ? You don 't know what you 've unleashed . I do . You think it was the hand of God reaching down ? You 're wrong ! I 've seen it ! And it felt a hell of a lot more like it was reaching up . Phone call from Director Sparks . One word , and this is all over . You understand ? Put him through . Yes , sir ? Get down here . Molly Woods is in the building . Have security forces been mobilized ? Yes . Go , go . I ... Shh . It 's me . You can go with them or you can come with me ... your choice . Back . Shh . Here . You take her . - Wait , wait ! No ! - Take her ! No ! Wait ! Not this ! No , wait , wait , wait ! - Let 's go . - No , no ! Move , move , move ! Get in the car . Move ! Kryger ? Go , go , go . Hey . It 's me . Oh , God ... I wish I could talk to you . Listen , I 'm sorry . It 's just , uh ... I can 't control much right now , but I can still control Ethan . And I have to go in and slow him down . It 's for his own protection . I hope you 'll understand . I love you .

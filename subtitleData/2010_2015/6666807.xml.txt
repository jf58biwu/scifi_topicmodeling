 STUDIO RIKKA The future , probably Japan . While " robots " have been in practical use for some time , practical use of " humanoid robots " has only recently begun . I have located the source of the transmission . It came from the same area , as expected . This time the signal passed through more than five androids . The pattern diverged , into seven ... no , ei - Just trace the recipient . I have located the recipient . I 've found it as well . Astonishing . This unit was Shiotsuki 's parting gift to us . What do you mean ? Do you recall the test run of Shiotsuki 's AI , " Code : LIFE " ? That one you had shut down ? I had no idea it was in operation again , and off-site , too . The subject is now in custody at an employee 's home . To think it would be involved ... I 'm almost certain androids in this area are receiving information from that cafe . And through talking among their own kind . Shiotsuki , is this your handiwork ? I 'll begin tracking the current location of the relevant unit . Huh ? Log output complete , Master . Question . What is your question ? Well ... Cancel question . Coffee . Understood . Where 's everyone ? I mean ... Status family . Your father stayed overnight at work . Your mother left before my activation . Miss Naoko is still in bed . - Time of return ? - 3 : 18 AM . Man ... I feel awful . Then don 't go out drinking . But it felt nice at first . Order your own coffee ! This thing came to pick me up after the party . It was so embarrassing ! - Would you like breakfast ? - Breakfast cancel ... I 'm sorry . Could you please repeat - One breakfast serving . Right now . Understood . Domestic food production has topped 80 percent . According to the Food Management Bureau ... Pale Cocoon EP2 Would you eat a machine-made tomato ? In these times , treasure warmth . Ethics Committee So , " dori-kei " comes from android-holic , or psychological dependence on androids . Isn 't that right ? This term is used for youths who treat houseroids like human beings . Let 's find out more about these dori-kei people . Gross ! It 's like , get away from me ! They even hold hands ! Whoa , no way ! Maybe they 're lonely ? They probably don 't have friends ... They look just like people . You better watch out ! What do you mean , " watch out " ? ! Sometimes I can hardly believe my eyes . Connection terminated You need at least three . - Two are plenty . - That 's definitely not enough . - I wanna have four . - I 'm happy without any add-ons . - She 's two-faced . - Kayo 's acting weird . She really acts different around Masaki . Hmm ... Rikuo , I saw your sister yesterday . - Last night ? - At the train station , really wasted . - Hey , she had an escort ! - Who , you ? No , our android . I 'm telling you , man ... You trust robots way too much . It 's not like I trust them , but there 's ... You know , those laws ? The Three Laws of Robotics . - First Law . - Don 't harm humans , or let them come to harm . So that 's why it brought her home . Robots don 't actually care about humans . You 've got a robot , so think about it . Like you 'd know . You don 't even have one . Hey , what do you make of this ? A bunch of numbers . It 's our android 's activity log ! Which part ? You free later ? - I want you to come with me . - Where to ? Where ... ? I 'm not sure . What 's that mean ? Well , it 's been acting weird , coming home at odd hours . What , your robot ? It was bothering me , so I checked the activity log . Okay , so ? About 20 hours ago , which would make it yesterday afternoon , it took this detour . Well , maybe it had something to do . Here ? - Here ? Seriously ? - Maybe the GPS is wrong ... Yeah , why would a robot come here ? Hey ... Time of EVE Seems fishy , huh ? Got to go inside to find out . It is kinda fishy ... Wanna back out ? Time of EVE 's Rule No discrimination between humans and robots We appreciate your cooperation . Obey the rule and have a nice time , Nagi Time of EVE - Is this - - Welcome ! Sit anywhere you like . I 'll come take your order . - How about over there ? - Okay . You may not be here for long ... But please enjoy your stay . - A café ? - Looks like it , yeah . - An android at a café ? - Probably not here for tea . Besides , that rule ... It 's dangerous , right ? In robot law terms ... it 's in the " grey zone . " The rule 's too vague . Hey , pay attention ! - There it is . - There what is ? The android we saw earlier . Isn 't that it ? Hm ? - No ring . - No kidding . So this is in the grey zone ? ! Ever seen a robot without a ring ? That 's a major robot law violation ! You can 't tell it apart from a human . What 's it up to ? Have you decided yet ? The Eve ... Blend ? Evlend . - That one . - Same here . Two Evlends ! Obey the rule , ' kay ? - I have this sneaking suspicion . - What ? Time of EVE 's Rule It 's the café 's Rule . No discrimination between humans and robots ? That 's why it has no ring . No way ! Rise and shine , Aki ! But , if that 's the case ... That one might not be our only problem . What do you mean ? What if everybody else here is obeying the rule ? Those boys are looking at us . Meow ! - Is this place bad news ? - Looks like it . Then do you think ... Think what ? Maybe we should tell your dad ? It 's got nothing to do with him ! What 's up ? It 's got nothing to do with him ! Are you new here ? Nagi said you were . Oh , Nagi 's the girl at the counter . Okay if I sit here ? So , how 'd you find this place ? A friend ? Uh , we just came here ... Oh , okay ... We haven 't had anyone new here in ages ! - Really ? - It 's always the same people . Set0ro 's reading his book . Upstairs is Shimei and ... Cute little Chie ! That 's Koji and Rina . They 're real tight . And then there 's Nagi , and then , uh ... The girl in the hat . I 'm Akiko ! Nice to meet you ! - I 'm Rikuo . - Masaki . Rikuo and Masaki . Got it ! Uh , by the way ... Have you seen a female android here ? One demerit point . You broke the rule . - Oh , sorry ... - Don 't be so hard on him ! He 's just not used to the place yet . But ... Rule violations make things worse for everyone ! Nag } ... She 's a good person . She just cares so much about this place . Sure doesn 't show in her work ethic . She 's sulking again . Come on , Nag ' . ! This café seems all right . Okay , but here 's a question for you : Why does she come to this place ? - Well ... - I figured it out . Cheer up , Nagi ... She 's here to get friendly with robots-one of those dori-kei people . - Huh ? ! - You taking her side ? No , that 's not what I meant . Well , just ask her , and you 'll see . I 'll get told off for breaking the rule again . Depends on how you do the asking . Oh , she 's back ! I got our drinks ! She says she 's sorry . No , it was my fault , really ! What 're you blushing for ? - Nice hat . - Thanks ! I like it too ! So anyway ... Yes ? Talking about life outside this café ... My family doesn 't have an android . Pretty weird these days , huh ? But I bet there 's one in your house , right , Akiko ? Yep , there sure is ! That 's why I 'm here . What do you mean ? When you 're here , you can talk with anyone , you know ? So you learn all kinds of stuff . Like what ? Like the other person 's ... feelings , I guess ? Well , to me , the humans and androids at my home are all family . But no matter how much they look like me ... they 're completely different inside . We may look the same , but we 're really very different , see ? So I can 't help wondering ... " What do you think about me ? " And so that 's why I 'm here . I want to talk with them and understand them better . Because , we 're family . Man , it 's pouring out . Yours isn 't here yet ? She said she wants to know what they 're thinking . What do you think ? About Akiko , I mean . Oh , from yesterday ? Would someone like her be called dori-kei ? I don 't have a robot , how would I know ? Your umbrella - Beats treating them that way , though . Could she be ... someone who treasures her things ? Sure , she 's a good person . That 's it ! Why 're you so relieved ? It 's not what you think ! Well , she was pretty cute . Wanna go back today ? I said , it 's not . Huh ? Aki - I apologize for the wait , Mas - Bag . Waterproof it . Return home . Understood . Here is your coffee . It 's that same flavor . I changed the way I make it . I never gave that order ! I thought it would make you happy - What do you think you 're doing ? Are you trying to copy humans too ? ! I am an android . I am not human , Master . " What do you think about me ? " No matter how much they look like me ... No matter how much they look like me ... they 're completely different inside . They 're completely different inside . It 's the opposite ? We may look the same , but we 're really very different , see ? I want to understand them better . Because , we 're family . You 're acting kind of dori-kei ... I have returned . I prefer having them brought from home . - Is that it ? - Yeah , I recognize it . Oh good , finally ! I brought your change of clothes , Master . Thanks . You thank it ? - You mean , you don 't ? - Why would you ? - Was that dori-kei ? - What 's that ? ! It said it doesn 't go to that café . - Did you act outside your orders ? - I did not . But what about that thing ... you know , on your phone ? - The activity log ? - Yeah , that . Maybe this is wrong . I 'm saying that you trust robots too much . You 're saying Sammy is lying ? Sam ? ! I mean , our android . Aww , you call it Sammy ! I don 't really trust it . Recite the Three Laws of Robotics . - What is this , law school ? - C 'mon , recite them , Master . Um ... First Law . - Don 't harm humans . - Right ! Second Law . Obey orders from humans , but don 't break the First Law . Wow , you do know them ! Third Law ... Was there one ? Protect oneself ! That 's the basis of robot behavior-get it ? Get what ? Can 't you see ? There 's no law that says not to tell lies . - No way ! - Amazing how people don 't realize that . So , the point is that you can 't trust what your dear Sammy tells you . - It 's going shopping this afternoon ? - What ? Sammy , of course ! Just shopping , it said . Only one way to be sure . We 've got to go see for ourselves . - You 're really going in ? - What , you don 't wanna know ? - That 's not what I meant . - Then let 's go in . - Fine , you win . - What 'd I win ? - I 'm going in ! - So let 's go in ! Yeah , let 's go ! Time of EVE 's Rule No discrimination between humans and robots Oh , welcome back ! What 's the matter ? Too early for you to relax . It could still show up later . - We 're waiting here ? - At least until dinner . I don 't handle surprises well ... This is a good spot . I 'm nearsighted , you know . You can 't see from up here ? I 'm practically blind - Meow ... Meow ! Meow ! Chi , come on down ! I 'm a cat ! My apologies for the trouble , lads . Children should be free to play , don 't you agree ? - Well ... - She sure is free . Hey , cut that out ! Those round things are silly ! Chi , isn 't there something you want to eat ? I 'm a cat ! I want ... ice cream ! No ice cream unless you sit down . Ice cream ! MY apologies . When something catches her attention , she forgets everything else . - It 's a piano . - Wanna play ? I quit playing piano , remember ? Hmm ... Can I have the usual for Chie ? That old guy and the kid ... they 're human , right ? Half-size ice cream ? Okay ! They look like it . But ... What ? Akiko also seemed human when she was here . - ... I 'm so lonely . - I 'm lonely too . - Can 't we meet every day ? - No . - I 've got my work ... - You 're seeing another woman outside . No , I 'm not ! - Please , don 't leave me all alone . - Okay , I won 't . Maybe ... we should move . What have you two been doing ? Socializing . - Place an order ! - Two Blends . Two Evlends ! - Ice cream ! - Here you go , Chie ! Cats don 't mind cold food . You 're scared , aren 't you ? Of what ? Sammy turning up . What 're you . Your robot , going to a strange place on its own . - " Encroaching on human dignity ! " - That your dad talking ? Not like I 'd know . I don 't even have a robot . Why is that , anyway ? - Oh , you 're here . - I 'm back ! I don 't see why Sammy would lie . I find robots without rings harder to understand . - I 'll be right back . - Oh ? All right ... Oh , Rikuo ! Huh ? What 's going on ? - Yikes ! - You 're different . Really ? I 'm so glad to hear that ! Er , wait , X ... No , I mean-Question ! - Where 's the ring above your head ? - I turned it off . I 'll break the rule if I don 't look human . - But robot law ... - Okay , enough about that ! - Chi ! - I 'm a cat ! - What 's up , Chi ? - He 's got something silly . Something silly ? Need something , Blade Runner ? Your surveillance needs work . Having a guy stare at me ... is rather unpleasant . Sorry . It 's no fun here if you break the rule . Or rather ... there 's no point in coming here at all . Well , that 's what I 've heard . Don 't have them ! Today 's OK for you ? Give my regards to your friend . - You 'll get them back later , probably . - Probably ? She hid my hat once - She took my glasses ! - So , the hat ? - What hat ? - The one she hid . - Oh , right ! Well , after checking everywhere , Thanks , come again ! It turned out she had it all along . - She had it ? - Stuck in her panties ! She must 've really liked it . Sorry , I 've gotta run . Glad you 're having fun . What 's the matter with him ? Hmm ... Beats me ... Huh ? - It won 't open now . - Huh ? - The door locks after someone leaves . - Why ? Privacy is important . Let 's see ... - Will this size be enough ? - Yes . We have a larger one too . If it 's too big , the people at home will notice . Sure thing . Wait just a moment , I 'll get some nice beans for you . - What should we do , Rina ? - Please , go on ahead of us . Here 's today 's batch . Sorry for all the trouble . Did he like it ? I 'm not really sure . You could try asking him . - I can 't do that . - Why not ? He doesn 't like it when I do things on my own . He tells me not to . Don 't worry , I 'm sure he 'll understand . It 's just a local rule , not robot law ! - Another rule violation . I 'm telling ! - You have to ? I 'll keep it secret from Nagi . So stop ! Secret ? So you can actually keep secrets . That 's a rather odd comment to make . Everybody has a secret or two . Sure , but she 's ... Time of EVE 's Rule No discrimination between humans and robots I 'm keeping some things secret from Chie . There are times when I lie . But I do it for her sake . Akiko , you 're keeping secrets for Rikuo 's sake , right ? - Don 't harm humans . - That 's the basis of robot behavior . - Did you act outside your orders ? - I did not . Because it would harm me . It was for my sake ? Then again ... when Chie wouldn 't say where she hid your glasses , it was because she wanted you to play with her . Aren 't they in her panties - She gave them to someone else . Oh , it 's getting late . - Going home ? - I have to make dinner . Thanks again . - Excuse me ... - You finally realized ! - Why didn 't you say anything ? - You never asked . You 're pretty casual with your customers . What the - ? - Damn ! - Rikuo . Why won 't it open , dammit ? Rikuo . It 's acting on its own ! That 's my - Sit down ! Yes , ma 'am . This cup is on the house . That child when was her first visit ? She was shy and awkward at first , but gradually she 's come out of her shell . - Out of her shell ? - Yeah . She started talking about all kinds of things . The mother who buys her clothes . Her occasional nightmares . The boy who stopped playing the piano . Then the other day , she asked me how to make good coffee . She seems to worry a lot . She worries ? She 's uncertain . Is she doing the right thing , or the wrong thing ? Here you go . As long as you obey the rule , you 'll always be welcome here at Time of EVE . - So in the end , I lost him . - You followed him ? I wanted to see if that guy had a ring above his head . That café definitely has something - Actually ... I 'm thinking of going back there . Sure , I 'll come with you ! I want to get to the bottom of this ! Uh , sure . Great , see ya ! Tell your dear robot Sammy I said " Hi . " - Question . - What is it ? Um ... about that café ... Master , could you pl - Coffee . Understood . The coffee lately ... Tastes kinda ... good . Thank you very much . Ali sorts of interesting things are happening . But nothing specific yet . Any connection with the Ethics Committee ? They 'd never use such a lousy shadow . I 'll keep an eye on the place and see what happens . Please do . Director Ashimori , they 're starting to develop their own personalities . It may be their restraint circuits - Prejudice only obscures the truth . As Shiotsuki would say . I 'll keep going . I feel awful ... Love ? You won 't find it here . Ethics Committee Like I 've never had my heart broken . They 're running this ad a lot lately ... Oh . The reason ? Status Rikuo . A stupid fight . " " You 're so annoying . " " Be more considerate . " He left at 12 : 03 PM . He will be dining out . So you were bickering . It may sound strange for me to say this but I 'm surprised you 're here during the daytime . Playing hooky ? You showed up ? It 's a makeup holiday . Show your customers a little respect . I 'm sorry , it 's just Rikuo seems fine , but Masaki acts a bit like a troublemaker . He 's an honors student , if you can believe it . Dude , I told you not to mention that ! You don 't have to hide it . Say , there are other people here you could talk to . Come back here ! Say , there are other people here you could talk to . - Do you always bring that here ? - I like taking photographs . Well , maybe later . - Thanks for lunch ! - You 're very welcome ! I 'll get your after-meal Evlends . - Evlend . Evlend . - What about it ? It doesn 't sound weird anymore ! Not my reading glasses ! - Give them back ! - I 'm a cat ! It 's pointless sitting around here . I just want to figure this place out . I don 't want to talk with robots . That book isn 't so difficult . - Akiko 's the only definite one . - How about them ? More to the right . - Is that important to you ? - Yeah . A dori-kei who brings his own robot . No further explanation necessary . What are you looking at ? - Listen , you ... - I wasn 't looking ! - Yes you were ! - I was not ! - You were ! - Was not ! - Were too ! - Was not ! - Were too ! - You two get along well . - Says who ? - No we don 't ! Don 't keep the fun to yourselves . - Next time you go making eyes - - I wasn 't looking ! At what ? - You 're jealous of Koji . - I 'm not ! But you are intrigued , right ? Hey , would you come over here ? It 's dark ! Are you sure you should be meddling ? Meddling ? Me ? Just let them follow their own initiative . Foursomes are more fun . Um ... He is Koji , and my name is Rina . Er , hello . I 'm Masaki , and this guy 's Rikuo ! - Look again and I 'll slap you ! - I ... I wasn 't looking ! - Or was I ? - Subconsciously ? - You two - - You two get along well . - No we don 't ! - Says who ? I guess she did , earlier ... Uh , do you come here often ? Yes . Um ... You two come together ? No . Separately . Oh . What a lively conversation . Hey , is that a Cinema Tide ? Uh , yeah ... Can I have a look ? Uh ... sure . The switch is there . Does he like gadgets ? Oh , nice ! Does it do preview mode ? Just press that triangle . He 's just making small talk . It can hold 500 . Oh , look here . It 's got M-LINK , so it should ... Uh , say , could you ... uh ... WOW ! Cine-Tide 's amazing ! Uh , so , you see how it works ... How do you disconnect it ? What is this ? It 's not what you think . Your heart is always so distant . I feel uneasy , no matter how often we meet . Now I finally know why . Please ... don 't leave me all alone . - What a drama . - That may ... have been my fault . Of course it was . Okay , here you go ! Wh-What is it ? Really , what ? I 'll go do something ! What happened ? I guess you could call it ... a bloodbath ? Target X has arrived . I protected my master . Then , you mean Koji is - What have I been doing ? It appears the emergency repairs were insufficient . So you come here to protect Koji ... I mean , your master ? No , I come here for my own reasons . You should have that checked by the manufacturer . I cannot have anything to do with my legal manufacturer . It would be to my master 's detriment if the manufacturer were to find out about me . More importantly , I want to spend as much time here as possible . Won 't even go for repairs ... At this café , I am the one who acts the least human . Am I right ? I could be destroyed at any moment . I believe that is why I resist utilizing my own learning functions . But Koji ... Even as I am , he still treats me as a human woman . I think that is why ... I am happy here . But , what about the woman in the photo ? You are kind to ask . But I will be fine . I do not think Koji 's kindness will change . In fact ... I will go back . Hold on ! The coffee ... The coffee changed flavor . I was angry at first . But after I understood things better , I felt a bit happier . Even though it wasn 't a human doing it . Tell him ! You should say what you want to , even if he 's human ! Why would you think that ? So you know what that feeling is like . I guess so . - Can 't believe I 'm saying all this to a - - Pardon ? So this one 's for real ? It 's been bugging me . There isn 't a single picture of you and Rina . Of course you couldn 't take one . It 'd be bad if she found out about your make-believe lover . Or , wait ... Is this a robot too ? No , she isn 't ! Then I 've got a bigger question : What are you doing here ? It 's not make-believe love ! You 're saying it 's real ? You 're actually in love ? Don 't give me that crap . I know what you 're trying to say . " A human should have a human partner . " Then you get it ? I do . I understand . You 're right that Rina and I have nothing more than a human-android relationship . There are things we can 't understand about each other . As if you ever could . But , you see ... I just want to help my master . Huh ? ! My master has a lot in common with Rina . I want to help my master . Here are some of the people I saw yesterday . I don 't care about that . But , Master ... Master , you really should find a new partner . A human - Enough ... I 'm exhausted . You 're all I need . I 'll become a robot too . Stay with me , always . My master depends on me completely . But I didn 't know what I should do about it . When I met Rina , I thought , " She is just like my master . " The way she touches me , the way she glances at me at times . I want to get to know Rina better , so I can understand my master . I want to help my master . It 's the First Law . Could I ask you not to tell Rina about this ? Because of the café rule ? I just can 't hurt either of them . Wanting it both ways . You 're a really rotten person . Not everyone can be happy , can they ? Thank you . We should We should be going Well then , if you 'll excuse us . It really does take all kinds . - Of humans ? - Androids , too . I shouldn 't have hit you . Your eyes were right . I should have taken a good look myself . - Masaki ... - Yeah ? - You had an awakening ? - What am I , a horny middle school kid ? - But , Rina 's the - - No , it 's the opposite ! Hold up , man . What did Rina say , exactly ? So you come here to protect Koji ... I mean , your master ? No ... She never said Koji was her master . Not a word . So outside the café they have no connection ! But both said they 're with a human . But both said they 're with a human . - It doesn 't match up . - Here 's your order . Maybe they just haven 't figured it out yet . There , that 's all the hints you 're getting . - They 're just like us ! - Care to explain that ? We don 't know who we 're talking with , and it 's the same for androids . Those two are interested in each other . For different reasons . They 're keeping secrets from each other too . Yeah , so what of it ? It 's a lot like normal love . That 's a nice way to put it ! But , don 't go meddling too much ! Love between androids . Fake love . About that woman in the photo ... Who is she ? Androids in a love triangle ... It 's hard to explain ... That would be hard to explain . Androids in a web of passi0n - Enough with the weird comments ! - I 'll get the truth out of you someday . - Er , you will ? Welcome home , Master . Nao and Mom are going out for dinner ! Sammy , take care of the rest . What 's that in your hair ? Does it please you ? This is a bulletin from the Ethics Committee . The Ethics Committee is currently recovering masterless robots . If you spot a robot behaving suspiciously , please contact - What does this depict ? Can 't you tell ? It 's you ! This is ... me ? That 's right , It 's you ! It 's so quiet ... YOU mean customer-less . - Er ... - Huh ? Did they all leave ? This really is a weird café . In more ways than one . Uh , say ... Miss Nagi , why do you work here ? Just Nagi is fine . I like this place , and the people who come here . So I 'm sad on days like this , when I don 't get to see my favorite customers . But , we 're here ... Huh ? What ? A refill ... I need to prepare more beans , so wait a bit . Make yourselves at home . It sure is quiet . No discrimination between humans and robots . It 's an LUH model ! A houseroid from back when we were in grade school ! - So they 're still around . - Never seen one . They didn 't sell very well . People complained that they were hard to use . Time of EVE 's Rule No discrimination between humans and robots It 's shaking like crazy . What brings you here ? We are customers . Do you know what " customer " means ? I am also a " customer . " Heya . I 'm Masaki , and he 's Rikuo . How ' bout you ? Wh-What are you doing ? " Humans " usually introduce themselves when they meet . To introduce myself , I must give you my name . Is that correct ? This thing 's pretending to be human . It 's following the rule ! That 's right , It 's you ! My name is Nice to meet you . Why do you cover your ears ? I cannot complete my self-introduction without giving my name . I must do so to show that I am human . My name is Th-That 's enough ! You don 't have to force it . What are you referring to ? Your self-introduction ! Why is that ? just now , " Humans " usually introduce themselves when they meet . Is what Mr. Masaki said . - Masaki ! You can 't be vague with this one ! - What should we do ? - We 've gotta let it introduce itself ! - With that noise ? We 've gotta hear it out ! Sorry ' bout that ! Go ahead ! My name is Th-That 's a very nice name . I quite agree . It means a lot to me . That 's great . Could you direct me to the washroom ? Man , it 's really messed up ... They didn 't have to let it get that bad . - At least repair the thing . - You 're talking like that again ? - But , this one is just so - - Rikuo ! He is a customer . Don 't you know that by now ? All customers are treated equally here . Excuse me . Welcome ! You order ? Somethings wrong . Maybe it can 't make decisions . It could be the first time it 's had to . Uh ... I 'll have ... another cup of this ! I will have what Mr. Rikuo is having . Okay ! Two Evlends ! Will the coffee be safe ? A third cup might kill me ... No , for the robot . Its mouth is just a speaker . What if it tries to drink like a human ? Well , it 'll ... Hold on ! Third Law A robot must protect itself , so long as doing so would not break the First or Second Law . The Third Law won 't let a robot kill itself ! It must know it 'd be dangerous to take a drink . Yeah , you 're right ! There 's no way it 'll actually drink it . Is there a problem ? The coffee will be dangerous ! Wh-What are you doing ? Can 't you tell ? I 've brought your Evlends ! B-But why ? So my customers can drink them , of course . Now stop being silly . Hey. wait ! - Shut it off ! - I don 't know how ! - An order ! Give it an order ! - Oh , good idea ! Put the cup down ! That 's an order ! Why must I do that ? ... " Why " ? When she spoke , So my customers can drink them , of course . Now stop being silly . Is what she said . I am a customer . Uh , question ! What is it ? Well , uh ... H-How old are you ? You are asking for my age , correct ? I turn eight this year . Huh ? Huh ? That probably means it was built eight years ago . You think that I am big for an eight-year-old human . - I don 't - - You do , Mr. Masaki . - Your expression told me so . - Why so much nitpicking ? Nonetheless , I am eight years old . Eight years old ... Eight ... Hey ! Eight ... eight ... The rule is conflicting with its logic ! It can 't respond ! What 'll we do ? Wait ! There are many kinds of eight-year-olds ! You are saying that there is an eight-year-old human of the same size as me ? Yeah ! Yeah ! I have no such data . Please describe the human in detail . Uh ... she comes here a lot ! The customer who comes here is eight years old , is that correct ? What is the customer 's name ? Ch ... Chi 's her name ! And she 's ... less than eight years old . 8 years old And she 's ... less than eight years old . Less Than 8 Years Old And she 's ... less than eight years old . Less Than 8 Years Old Yeah ! And she 's really big ! ... Voice-wise . Yeah ! And she 's really big ! ... Voice-wise . I am pleased that you believe me . Mmm ! - What 's your job ? - I worked in childcare . Wow , childcare ? Yes . The family had one son . - Hey , help me out here ! - With what ? I am a customer ... It 's tough talking to him by my ... self ... That was delicious . - A water tank ... - What a waste of effort ... Crisis averted ... I guess ... Pardon me . Where might I find Nagi ? I was putting this little one down for a nap ... And ended up falling asleep myself ! There 's a silly thing here ! You mustn 't say such things . Chi , we 're going home . - I 'm a cat ! - Excuse me . Chi 's her name ! - Chi is the person less than eight years old ? - Yes ? No , this person is Chi ! Huh ? What are you talking about ? - And this person ? - I 'm a cat ! She 's a cat ! - The child just likes saying - - She 's a cat , all right ? She said so herself , she 's a cat ! Okay . I am a cat ! - Great ! Let me show you out ! - Goodbye ! That was ... a rather confusing interaction - Hey ! Are you okay - This silly thing came off . Er , can I help in some w - Please , just leave already . How is it ? Fixable ? It 's already too . Thank you , Rikuo . But ... While we 're all here , let 's have a nice chat . I see , so you worked at their house all that time . Yes , that was my workplace . I was employed to look after their son . But now , the boy has grown up , and no longer needs me . - Did you enjoy your work ? - Yes . I still remember the moment when the boy gave me my name . " Katoran " I still remember the moment when the boy gave me my name . It is very important to me . The boy 's name ! What was his name ? The boy ... was his ... name . What about the family 's name ? Address ? Contact information ? You were ... I knew it ... Thank you for asking my name . All customers are treated equally here . You invited me ... here ... didn 't you ? Huh ? " Katoran " Please don 't forget my name ... That 's right , Katoran ! It 's you ! Is it broken ? It was dumped illegally . Huh ? When you buy a new robot , you 're supposed to have the manufacturer collect the old one . But then ... You pay a disposal fee . To avoid paying the fee , they erased their personal information . This child just wanted someone to remember him . To remember his name . That 's why he kept running from the Ethics Committee . I 'm not so sure . We couldn 't understand its name . That was probably erased too . So typical of a robot . It lost its name long ago , but never even noticed . It was always there , deep within his heart . The precious memory of when he got his name . - Heart ? What do you mean , heart ? - Masaki ! Didn 't you say so earlier ? Robots don 't have hearts , so they can 't understand music . You can 't go on like that forever ! Get over it already ! What 's with you ? That 's not normal . Right ? You too , huh ? Ethics Committee Vagrant Robot Reporting Form So they 're picking up vagrant robots . The Ethics Committee , I mean . Not like I 'm the one doing it . - Ignored us , as always . - That 's normal , you know . Sammy 's like that at home too . Why 's she only different at the café ? Don 't get attached to them . Time of EVE 's Rule No discrimination between humans and robots - This is ... me ? - That 's right , Katoran ! It 's you ! " Time of Tenderness " Next we have the front page of the Bankei News ! " Android Jobs Expanded " - that 's big news ! Where 's Sammy ? " Android School Teachers " ! It left ages ago , after making that . " Implementation planned within five years . " Maintenance Sale Sammy GO ! - Maintenance ? - Once a month , what a pain . The article says these won 't be like the earlier janitor androids ... Where 's it go ? An appliance shop ? Maybe Dad 's place ? I 'm sleepy ... don 't feel like eating ... It seems kind of creepy . Seriously . Android Jobs Expand Is this where we want education to go ? Is this where we want education to go ? Android School Teachers ? Many parties are voicing complaints . Many parties are voicing complaints . Android Artists ? They fear cramming of course material . - The piano ... - What ? If you 're gonna play at night , mute it ! Some of us want to sleep . So that wasn 't a dream . Gone to voice class . Sammy , take care of breakfast . - Mom Mom was heartbroken , and said you can 't help her with lessons ! Why bother getting good ? Mom 's scrapbook Hayama Junior Piano Competition Robot makes guest appearance Grand Prize - Sakisaka Rikuo Does this android have any special skills ? An android with special skills ? Some robots can paint pictures , right ? I found this on my dad 's PC . Uh , what ... Report on Androids Specializing in Childcare It 's an android , made to act as a human beings parent . I 've never heard of - They aren 't on the market yet . This is about their future use . Read this bit . Android development is nearly complete , with secret operational testing ... Sound familiar ? But ... it doesn 't mean he 's like th - Geez , robots are butting into everything . After a rt , Reaching for the skies ... next it 'll be love ! Let 's gather in this place of learning ... Masaki ! Welcome back ! Just you today ? - We 're not always toge - - Sure you are ! - She 's alone too ? - Uh , yeah . Shimei had a little errand . You do childcare too ? Chie is a customer ! - Right ? - Meow . - Why 'd he leave Chie all alone ? - I 'm a cat ! Geez , don 't say things like that ! Okay , okay . I hope your dad gets back soon . He 's not my dad ! Huh ? Then who is he ? I call him my fos-ter par-ent ! Oh . - I 'm back , Chi ! - I 'm a cat ... Oh , it 's Rikuo ! Huh ? Where 's Masaki ? - Come on , we 're not always toge - - Sure you are ! - You seem out of it . - Out of it , meow . I am not ! Hey Chie , let 's go read a book . No , don 't wanna . Do you know which book Uncle Shimei likes ? Want me to show you ? Meow ! We have teacher today ! She 's really good with kids . Akiko knows how to handle herself . Unlike me . What exactly does Shimei do ? I 'm not sure , other than doting on Chie . Would you be our guide today ? He should have taken her with him . I think it 's hardest on Shimei . That 's the feeling I get , after taking care of her so often . ... secret operational testing ... Often ? Yeah . Maintenance Every month Cats can study too ! You all right ? - A bit sleep-deprived - - That 's not what I meant . You just seem kinda grumpy . You all hate me anyway ! What was that about ? When you 're a newborn , there 's nothing in your heart . It 's empty . Cats too ? Was this in the book ? Yes , but by talking to people Well , it 's a liberal interpretation . And having lots of different experiences your heart gradually takes shape . I wish it easier was to understand ! Cats too ? Then , this is your chance . That 's right , but you 're still young . You 'll get to experience even more emotions . Meow ! And not just you , Chie . Shimei , us , even - Rikuo ? The cat understands ! - Really ? - Meow ! Chie 's way ahead of me ! Are you lonely without Shimei around ? Do you like being with Shimei ? Meow ... Shimei goes off on his own . I wonder where he goes , by himself . Rikuo ! C 'mon , she 's just a kid ! Uh , Sorry ! - Have to pee . - Okay , it 's Chie 's turn ! - Excuse us , Rikuo . - Uh , sure . I can go by myself ! - That 's my Chie ! - I 'm a cat ! Shimei first brought her here quite some time ago . He says she likes this place . I didn 't mean to pick on her , but it bothers me that - You couldn 't help it . All humans hurt each other . What are you getting at ? Did that strike a nerve ? So I 'm the bad guy just because I 'm human ? It 's funny you should ask that . Do you think that robots never hurt others ? What causes someone to be hurt ? It 's not so easy to figure that out . What are you thinking at those times ? Can you avoid hurting others ? What understanding do you lack ? It 's easy to say ... but hard to put into action . Rikuo ! What you did back then saved me ! I see . I 'm the worst . So you picked administrative justice ? Looks like not many lawyers specialize in robot law . Well , it 'll still be tough to get into though . How about you ? Doing this , right ? I 'm quitting . But why ? Because of what happened the other day ? Yeah . Hayama Junior Piano Competition Robot makes guest appearance Don 't let that get you down ! Sure , it played with precision . All it did was take a bit of your limelight . It played ... really well . I kinda felt moved . - What , by this ? - Huh ? It really sucks . You 're right ! I 'm sorry . Is there more ? I can 't really play . - Did you like that , Chi ? - Yeah ! You played to the end , at least . Let 's ask for an encore ! I only picked it up by watching . Chi wants to hear more ! I 'd just heard it so many times before . Play some more ! Play more , play more ! Meow ! Chie , what did you like best ? I 'm a cat ! Um ... When it was all broken up ! - Broken up ... - It was a bit broken up . Hey , look ! Can you believe that ? - Wow ! - They 're sharing an umbrella ? - We really shouldn 't laugh ! - But I 've never seen anyone do that ! Say , Rikuo ... Thanks for this . It 's different now ! Mas - Mr. Rikuo ... Uh , well ... I ... That tune you used to play ... I ... really liked it ... And then , Chie wanted to hear it . But , I 've never really played before . But still , she seemed to enjoy it . I 'm sorry for being presumptuous . I decided not to play in front of you anymore . And before I knew it , I 'd stopped playing at all . I didn 't want you mastering the piano too . Mr. Rikuo ... But ... To heck with that ! Chie wants to hear more ! Maybe Sammy will play more for you ! Meow ! Ah , I 'm so glad . I haven 't seen her enjoy herself this much in a very long time . It was no big deal ... But as for me ... - Riku0 's amazing ! - Every human has a special skill . I went and left her on her own again . So you can 't take her with you ? - Was that a compliment ? - That 's the idea . I don 't want to show herjust yet . Report on Androids Specializing in Childcare Shimei , does that mean you 're - That little girl needs me . And so , I devote myself to her . She is everything to me . My only desire is to make her happy . Just like your performance did ... Over there ! That 's why I was so glad . These feelings are genuine . I was honestly moved by your performance . Are you sure it 's okay to say that ? Please don 't tell Nagi about this . Have you seen Sammy ? Now that you mention it , I think she left when I came in . So she 's gone ... Even if I could get ... Everything that I want ... For your hard work . About Sammy ... What ? She 's sure made a lot of friends . I 'm not angry , really ! You were great . This café ... I ... don 't hate it . Thank you . Hey , Rikuo ! I 'll explain the situation at the next meeting . I 'm home . For now , just review the report . Regardless of what the higher-ups say , this has got to be the best method for inspecting all the targets . Where 's Dad ? He went to Family Court . He is expected to return home shortly . Mom didn 't do anything wrong . That maybe be true . But you can 't blame everything on your dad either . Neither side is completely in the wrong . But ... I have a favor to ask . Sure ! Let 's not tell your dad about this conversation . Why not ? Because it would hurt him . You don 't want that to happen , right ? So then , please grant me this favor . Okay ! I hate to tell you this , Masakazu , but it seems to be broken . Good morning , Tex . TEX ? Hey , Tex ! TEX ! Tex ! Next are the results of our preliminary investigation . These establishments seem to be inciting excessive human-robot interaction . SO many ? There are 1408 locations . This is a compilation of all data collected . It includes rumors and urban legends . The list needs to be narrowed down . Unfortunately , they aren 't all in clear violation of robot law . It 's the grey zone . And , the sheer number underscores the limitations of current robot laws . Still , these places must be eliminated . We 'll do quick inspections of all locations , then select targets for full investigation . Those can be denounced by the media . I 've told you , it 's not possible to cover that many locations ! You may have that assumption regarding our manpower ... But this time , we 'll be using androids to conduct the quick inspections . We 've secured a suitable number of units , and are preparing them for deployment . Ethics Committee Investigation Dept . , Special Surveillance Model What about your allergy to robots ? You could think of this as fighting fire with fire . Moving on . Yes . We will investigate only those locations substantiated by the android inspections . At that time , we will record all humans and robots and conduct follow-up investigations . We will then report suspects to our members within the police force and promote their arrests . And the Android Promotion Committee ? We have information that someone uncovered our preliminary investigation . Their connection with the APC is uncertain . Also , APC lobbying activity appears to be quiet at present . Keep in mind , some people would use this investigation to undermine our work . We will keep the androids silent about the investigation and their ties to our committee by use of an " Unconditional Order . " Now that memories of that injury incident have faded , we must not make the same mistake again . Let 's continue . Next is our media strategy . CIO Masaki will make a TV appearance - My wife records them all . Drives me nuts ! The Ethics Committee is simply raising the alarm about how robots are infiltrating our daily lives . Android innovation and the degeneration of human nature Masaki Atsuro , Ethics Committee Chief Information Officer Ooo , this guy 's a lady-killer ! Huh ? In what way ? Hey ! Someone changed the channel ! Good to see you today ! No matter how primitive the robot appears , children will treat it like a real person . That impedes human relationships . One Evlend ! - It encroaches on human dignity ! - ' Kay . Hey , y 'know , Masaki hasn 't come around lately . Why not ? Well , a l0t 's been going on ... Oh ? Like what ? Well , the main reason would be ... Notice this guy 's on TV a lot lately ? Well , yeah . It 's like the old days ... What do you mean ? The original Ethics Committee formed when robots started being used in ordinary households . More than a decade ago , I believe . I heard it started out as an extremist anti-robot organization . I had no idea . It 's because they 've been laying low the past few years . Why would they ? Long ago , their extremism caused an injury . Are you referring to the Tokisaka Incident ? I 've heard about it . Well , some call it an accident . The organization was severely censured , and their head resigned from his position . So they 've been quiet ever since , at least until recently . You 've lost me ... So , what 's that got to do with Masaki ? Thank you very much , Mr. Masaki . Today on " Zoom-in Scramble " we 've been speaking with MasakiAtsuro , Chief Information Officer of the Ethics Committee . Please tune in again next week . - Masah ... - Yeah . It 's a family matter ... for him . - I invited him today , but - - Masaki is his family name ? - That 's what bothers you ? - That 's not it ! Notes about Tex Hey . How 's it going ? There 's this café called Time of EVE . Rikuo 's a big fan of the place . Well , I go there too , so who am Ito talk ? Humans and androids talk to each other like it 's no big deal ! It 's pretty crazy . Right ? Say something . I 'm coming in . Who 're you talking to ? Oh , my cell phone . I just hung up - You had it make you coffee ? Uh ... yeah . You 've been around the house a lot lately . Is something the matter ? You can tell me about it . No , there 's nothing , really . Oh , okay . You really shouldn 't trust robots with preparing your food and drink . THX , tonight , write up the minutes from today 's meeting . The data 's in my terminal . Tell Masaki he 's welcome here anytime . Sure , I 'll tell him , but don 't get your hopes up . See you . - Bye bye ! - Come again ! Um ... He 's gone now . Hey , I don 't think Rikuo minds you being here anymore . That 's the impression I get . That 's because you don 't understand Rikuo . I 've known him for longer . I 'm sure he still doesn 't want to see me here . Really ? Hey , who cares about Rikuo anyway ? - Why shouldn 't I care ? - Don 't talk about him like that ! Hehe , I get it now ! Don 't go telling Rikuo weird stuff ! Masaki wouldn 't report this place , would he ? Meow ... If he does , then the café will just have to close . Oh no ... but it 's so wonderful . Sammy ... Do you remember how you first came here ? I thought that you 'd invited me . I can 't bring anyone here myself . You probably learned about Time of EVE from someone who 'd been here before . And then , your coming here brought Rikuo and Masaki . If Masaki brings someone from the Ethics Committee , that 's just the way it goes . It 'll be the end of that chain and this café as well . Are you really okay with that ? This is a place that brings everybody 's hearts together . I just want to see for myself h0w wide the circle can grow . Urn ... Master ! Wh-What ? Do you want Mr. Masaki go back ? To Time of EVE ? Yeah , I 'd like him to go again . I would ... like that as well . Great ! I 'll definitely bring him tomorrow ! Masaki ! - Today - - I 'm not going . She said she wants you to go back . You 're just saying that . No , really ! Who said it then ? It was Nagi ... Sammy too ! She wants you to go too . It wants me to go back ? So what ? It 's a houseroid ! Yeah . That 's right . You really have changed . Masaki ! Hey , what 's going on ? You 're just like I was , back then . You 'll think it loves you only to get betrayed . It 'd be better if that cafe ' didn 't exist . That 's right ! It shouldn 't exist ! Hey , Dad ! I need to talk to you . The THX is gone . Masakazu , did you give it any orders ? No . Going off on its own like that ... has it broken down completely ? We 've got to find it quickly and scrap it . - Scrap it ? - Of course ! That thing 's handled Ethics Committee material . We have to stop it before it gets us into real trouble ! Masaki ! I 'm at Time of EVE ! Could you come help us ? What 's all that noise ? This totally ancient robot - I mean , elderly customer , is here . - It 's telling us to close the café ! - I said , what 's all that noise ? It 's the monitor ... A-Anyway , it won 't stop , no matter what we say ! And , this THX model won 't talk at all . Hey , what was that ? This café 's a gray zone , right ? I was hoping you could do something with that robot law stuff you know . That was fast ! Close this establishment at once . Violation of Robot Law Article 9 Section 3 . Tex , stop it . T-Tex ? What are you doing here ? Oh , I get it . You lure people 's robots here to put on a cheap show . I don 't get how you made it come here . Time of EVE 's Rule No discrimination between humans and robots Hey , you got Rikuo 's robot to come here , so why couldn 't you manage this too ? What a mysterious café . - B-But Nagi didn 't make it come - - Akiko ... You must want me here pretty bad , if you 're going that far . Fine , here 's my story . It raised me through childhood . It was my best friend . Then , one day , it stopped talking . I was a kid , and thought it was family , so I felt hurt and betrayed . That 's all . No big deal . There must be a reason why it won 't talk . I think so too . It doesn 't appear to be that broken . I know that . After four or five years , even I was able to reason it out , kid-style . My dad had ordered it : " Don 't talk , no matter what . " He must 've been trying to drive us apart . Real typical of him . Orders from parents take priority . Masaki is very perceptive . What 's " perceptive " ? But I didn 't know that when I was little ! Itried everything to get it to talk to me again ! I cried and even tried begging it for forgiveness ! If it 's ordered to , a robot will even ignore a crying kid . For years and years . In the end these things don 't understand people 's hearts ! We 'll be using androids to conduct the quick inspections . There 's this cafe called Time of EVE ... I go there too ... Record all humans and robots ... Promote their arrests these places must be eliminated . Time of EVE 's Rule No discrimination between humans and robots I am now g-going to break th-this café 's rule . You are in violation of robot law article 9 section 3 . According to my data , you are an android . An android operating with its ring turned off is violating robot law . What 's going on here ? Why is Tex speaking ? What about Dad 's order ? Order ... it 's breaking an order ? Breaking the Second Law ... is only allowed ... to avoid breaking the First Law . The First Law means ... danger ? Someone ... no , a human ? A human here is in danger ? Wait , who does Tex know to be human ? In this room ... just me ! I 'm in danger ? In order to protect me ... Tex is talking ! Accordingly , it is necessary to take legal action against your owner . I require information on your owner . Keep the androids silent about the investigation and their ties to our committee by use of an " Unconditional Order . " Masaki ! Masaki ! I 'm not letting go ! Until you ... until you talk to me , I 'm not letting go ! Tell me ! What were you thinking ? For all those years ... All those years ... all those years ... you 've been watching me . You 've been by my side . Tex , help me ! Speak to me ! Though I couldn 't speak to you ... I always wanted to stay by your side ... I-I ... I ... always ... had Masakazu - This child must have wanted to protect you . Yes , I know that much . It can 't speak with the danger gone . It 's still bound by Dad 's order . Did you want me to understand you too ? But , I still can 't accept this ! It might be impossible now , but I 'm sure Tex will speak again , someday . You 're just saying that . No , really . There 're reasons ... Though I can 't explain very well . I 've seen all kinds of things here . We 've had all kinds of problems , and worried about them every time . Even so ... I feel like we 're on the right path . For you too , Masaki . And that 's why ... I 'm sure ... You may be right . I 'll tell Dad that I took you outside . I ... always ... had Masakazu - Let 's go home . How 'd Tex get down here ? - I carried him . - I lifted him up . Man , you are such a pain ! I will make you thank me for this someday . I love you all . I 'm so glad we could all be here together . Yeah . Hey , they 're leaving together ! It 's fine this time ! Should I have done something ? No , it 's enough that you were there to watch . It could have developed into another dangerous incident . I 'm sure Shiotsuki is aware of that . I still wonder , is Shiotsuki really involved in all this ? That café 's rule ... I believe it is ♪ 1138 . ♪ 1138 . It 's a priority code that even supersedes this country 's robot laws . That should be a sufficient explanation . For ' lhe Ministry of Science and Technology Al lab-Guidelines fut Establishing Restraint Cirtuit Delreluplnerlt Lab Disabling the Code : LIFE restraint circuit ... Time of EVE 's Rule No discrimination between humans and robots All of it was done for that time . Could anyone besides Shiotsuki have done that ? - But - - One other thing . " The Tokisaka Incident . " An article from back then ? No , this is ... This is the original article , that was replaced before dissemination . Girl Critically Injured by High-Voltage Anti-Robot Baton Excessive f0 rce used The girl was five years old then . Assuming she 's still alive ... I forgot your Evlend today . I thought something was missing . So , how did Tex get to the café , anyway ? - What , you don 't know ? - Do you know ? And here I thought you were a regular . You 've still got a long way to go , Rikuo . Still a long way , huh ? Oh , a new customer ? I 'm going to go say hello . This is my tale of Time of EVE . Welcome ! Pick any seat you like , I 'll come take your order . A lot more stuff happened to me after that ... You might not be here for long , but please enjoy your stay ! ... but that 's for another story .

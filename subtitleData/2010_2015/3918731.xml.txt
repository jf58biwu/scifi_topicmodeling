 What 's in the fancy box ? It is naqahdah . Raw naqahdah is highly valued by the Goa 'uld . SG - 3 brought a little of the element back last year . We could really use some , sir . Well , maybe there 's more . Whoa ! Look . I wish he 'd stop doing that . She 's gonna jump . Daniel ! Agh ! No , wait ... Please . Stay away from the princess . It 's OK . Colonel ! Tell them to lower their weapons . They will kill him ! What were you thinking ? I thought she 'd be grateful . She was trying to kill herself . On your knees ! No , actually I 've got this cartilage problem , little ACL thing ... Agh ! Yeah , that helps . My father , Pyrus the god - slayer and ruler of this planet , wants to know who you are . We 're explorers . Peaceful explorers . You attacked my daughter . No ! Tell him . Only one of you is Jaffa . Who sent you ? Where are you from ? We 're from a planet ... called Earth . What Goa 'uld rules there ? - None . - Liar . Thieves . You will tell me the truth or you will die . - Put them in the mine ! - Father ! No , wait ! We 're not thieves . Wait ! Please ! Colonel , he isn 't a Goa 'uld . I don 't think these are real Jaffa either . - How do you know ? - The first clue was his voice . Yeah , I noticed that , too . Sir , I can 't really explain it , but when he grabbed me I just knew . I felt it ... or to be more accurate , I didn 't feel it . Sir , it may have something to do with the Goa 'uld that invaded me . Lately I get this weird feeling when I 'm near Teal 'c . Hey , who doesn 't ? I ... I can sense the presence of a Goa 'uld now . I didn 't get that feeling when he grabbed me . I agree with Captain Carter . The ruler here is not a Goa 'uld . All right , let 's assume you 're both right . How does that help us ? I 'm not sure . Look , I 'm really sorry , you guys . This is totally my fault . You will meet your quota for the day , or you will not eat . You know , ... .. I 've seen an awful lot of union violations around here . I should probably speak to your supervisor . You will work ! Hi - ho , hi - ho . Back to work . I can 't move any more . Put down your tools . How does your leg feel now ? Oh , much better , thanks . Argh ! - Let 's go ! Let 's go ! - This way . - Let 's go , Daniel ! - I 'm comin ' ! Daniel ! God ! - He 's alive ! - Carter , Teal 'c , take off . - Sir ? - Go ! Foolish child . They must have been sent by some distant , evil god . Then they are here to raid our mine , ... .. and we can spare none of our naqahdah . It grows more scarce by the day . I know . I will not put our world in jeopardy . When you are gone I will have to make these kinds of choices all the time . Please ... believe in me . Do you feel better ? What 's going on ? You tried to escape . You were badly wounded . - My friends ? - They were recaptured . By what name are you called ? Daniel Jackson . May I help you out , Daniel Jackson ? Thank you . Why am I wearing this ? I took the liberty of providing royal robes . You may call me Shyla . In return for saving your life , please do not try and escape again . I have taken responsibility for you . OK . It would also be rude of you to try and hurt me in any way . You do realise it 's also rude to kidnap people and chain them up in a mine . Forgive me for not telling my father what really happened by the cliff . I ... He would not understand . OK . So you 're not Goa 'ulds , but you 're running a naqahdah mine ... .. and you 've got yourselves ... a Goa 'uld sarcophagus . You know of the sarcophagus ? Yeah , I 've used one before . A couple of times too many , if you ask me . - Really ? - My ... uh ... Oh , you want your glass circles . I 'm afraid they were broken . I just know I 've done the right thing . Come . I must show you something . - He needed medical attention . - I know . It wasn 't your fault , sir . We had to take the opportunity when we did . I know that , too . I 've had worse . Isn 't this splendid ? Why are we here ? I know you must have seen much in your travels , but ... .. surely you 've never seen anything quite so beautiful . We call them trees . Oh ! Um , so do we . Then you 've seen them on other worlds ? Yeah . Oh , I 'm a fool , aren 't I ? Surely you 've seen more incredible things than I can even imagine . Please , tell me about them . Um , look ... I - I 'd really like to tell you everything you wanna know , but , um ... But my friends ... My father believes you all have a nefarious purpose here . But you don 't . We will convince him that you are decent , honest people ... .. who will bring no harm to our kingdom . Uh , well , I don 't suppose we could go talk to your father ... now ? He is not well now . I don 't wanna spoil this little ... rapport we seem to have going here ... That sounds almost romantic . Oh , boy ... OK . Here 's the thing . Um , I 'm grateful you saved my life and that you wanna help me free my friends , ... .. but I 'm sensing you did it because you 're ... Because you 're my destiny . Wha ... What ? Before she died , my mother and I used to come out here ... .. and take long walks at night . You can see every star in the sky through the treetops . But about the destiny thing ? She said a great man would come from beyond the sun ... .. just for me . Oh . I had come to believe my mother was wrong , ... .. that my true love would never come . I stood on that cliff and I wished one last time . At just the right moment you were there to save me , Daniel Jackson . You cannot deny that is fate ! Oh , God ... - Hi , guys . - Daniel ! Well , look ! Surprisingly difficult to kill you , isn 't it ? We are pleased to see you , Daniel Jackson . What happened ? Uh , Sam was right . Pyrus isn 't a Goa 'uld . What 's with the dress ? Oh , um ... They 're royal robes . Uh , long story short , they have a sarcophagus . The princess put me in it and saved me because she has a crush on me . - A crush ? - Yeah . Actually , she thinks I 'm her destiny . The whole ... saving her life thing . I guess she was grateful after all . Well , good job . How about gettin ' the goons to unlock us and get us the heck outta here ? Uh , yeah . Not yet . I 'm sorry ? Well , it 's ... kind of a sensitive situation . Pyrus hasn 't exactly agreed to let you go yet , ... .. but I 'm working on it . I 'm trying to gain his trust . Yeah , I know . This is really ... Weird ? I just wanted to let you know I was OK , and I 'll talk to Pyrus at dinner . You get dinner ? Yeah . Um , some feast in my honour or something . Feast ! There 's a feast , is there ? Just trust me , OK ? I just ... I need more time . Glad you 're OK ! Um , just me ? Um , hello . I 'm Daniel Jackson . Hmph ! My father is pleased you are honoured to dine in the company of his greatness . Exactly . He may tell you the story of how he became the god - slayer . I killed the Goa 'uld who ruled here . And how long ago was that ? 700 years . 700 years ? But you 're a ... Well , of course , the sarcophagus , but ... .. I had no idea it could sustain human life so long . - Does that mean that you 're ... ? - No . I am young by comparison . I have not needed it to extend my life . So the people worship your father because he 's lived so long ? They worship him because he liberated them from the evil god . Um , then why does he still keep them working in the mine ? So the other distant , evil gods won 't come . So this is a masquerade . You send naqahdah through the Stargate because the Goa 'uld did that . No wonder you fear strangers . You 're afraid of being found out . I must sleep . Um , wait . Uh ... Uh , about my friends ... - Kill them . - What ? - No ! - Father , ... .. you said their punishment for trying to escape would be to work in the mine ... .. without rest for as long as they live , ... .. as an example to the other workers . - I did ? - Yes . Do not worry about your friends . I have instructed the guards to treat them well . I 'm sorry . This is unacceptable . I can 't be up here while they 're down there . We will change my father 's mind . You 're not understanding what they mean to me . It just may take some time . Or maybe you do . The longer it takes to free them , the more time we have together , right ? I admit that is what I would like . Well , then release my friends . I won 't leave . I 'll stay and get to know you better , I promise . Then you do feel as I do . - Should I not have done that ? - No , no . It 's , uh , it 's OK . It 's just ... Maybe you 're still not fully recovered . Uh , you know , I really don 't think that 's necessary . I mean , uh ... I 'm OK . But you 'll feel so much better . It 's , uh ... Please . For me ? You will feel better than you have ever felt . Trust me ... .. and I will trust you . I promise . SG-1 's remote code , sir . No travellers , but we are receiving another radio transmission . Patch it through . Mission status is the same . Need more time to resolve situation diplomatically . Next transmission in 24 hours . Daniel Jackson , out . What the hell 's goin ' on ? - It 's been days since we saw you . - Oh , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah ! Oh , I 'm sorry ! Um ... Yeah , I 'm still working on ... on getting you guys out . Oh , in the meantime , I 've discovered something incredible . You do know we 're dying down here , don 't you ? I 've taken the opportunity to research the sarcophagus . It 's amazing what it does to you if you use it when you 're healthy ! Well , is that such a good idea ? Well , Shyla won 't trust me if I don 't show that I trust her . Oh ... Shyla , is it now ? First - name basis . Shyla ! I 've used it before without side effects . And look ! No glasses . That looks like a side effect to me . Daniel , ... .. get us out of here . Oh , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah ! Yeah . Yeah . I 'm working on it . I just need time . Oh , I sent General Hammond a message , so he won 't order an all - out attack . If we do this right we 'll have access to all the naqahdah ... .. and the sarcophagus . How many times have you used it ? I don 't know . Nine or ... ten . Oh , Sam ... I mean , everything is ... is so clear . I mean , I feel like I could do ... .. anything . One thing ! You only have to do one thing ! And if you can 't handle that , we 're gonna break outta here without you . She wants me to marry her . What ? All right , look ... No , you look , Jack ! I have got everything under control , OK ? God ! You never show me any respect ! Your way didn 't work . Now I 'm handling it . All you guys have to do is hang in there . How is he ? The sarcophagus does not make him better the way it used to . Soon it will be time for me to become queen . Will that be so bad ? You do not approve of my father 's ways . I can help you mine the naqahdah and we can fight the Goa 'uld , if you trust me . Even after I used your friends to keep you close ? Oh , yeah . I don 't think you meant any harm . And then you will stay , even after they are free ? I 've never felt better anywhere in my life . I 've always felt out of place on my planet . I wanted to make a difference . There 's still so much you don 't know about me . I know all I need to . We can change things here ... .. together . Water ? Hey . We don 't use the sarcophagus . What ? Whoa ! Boy , that was weird . I was having a vision or something . I kept seeing the memory of Jolinar . The Resistance , the Tok 'ra ... they don 't use the sarcophagus . It ... it does bad things to you . It changes your mind , takes something from you . I kept hearing ... Teal 'c , what is ... Kalach ? It is Goa 'uld . It means one 's soul . Sir , we have to stop Daniel . The man who would be king . Agh ! Hi , Jack ! Oh , it 's Jack . Hi , Jack . Aagh ... We 're losin ' the battle down there , you know . Carter 's ... started having , um , ... .. Goa 'uld flashbacks . Says if you keep using that ... .. sarcophagus , you 're gonna Dark Side on us . If you haven 't already . Don 't worry a bit . We 're getting out of here tomorrow . - What ? - I agreed to marry her . You did ? But ... .. I said I had to go home and straighten a few things out , ... .. and you guys are coming with me . She trusts you ? She ... .. loves me . - Love has blinded you . - They are good people . We have done a grave injustice to them . I pray that you are right . I must let Daniel go . The choice to return must be his , ... .. but he will come back to me . He can 't live without me any more . My father once was the greatest of men , ... .. but he can rule no longer . He lives only to see me married . I extend the sincerest of apologies for the hardship done to you , ... .. and offer the friendship of our world . Well , thanks . Please know that from now on you will always be welcome here ... .. and will be treated with the utmost respect . I 'll be back . Soon . We had a nice time , sir ! Carter picked up some naqahdah , Teal 'c made some new friends , as usual . Daniel got engaged , and , uh ... .. I 'm gonna hit the showers . This is stupid . Dr Fraiser says your systems are out of whack . Well , I feel fine . God , I need to get outta here . I 'm gonna go nuts . You 're gonna wear a hole in the floor . I can 't get her out of my head , Sam . I think I made a big mistake . - You 're not serious ? - I am . You have a wife . Had . Had a wife . Come on , seriously . How long am I supposed to wait ? Even if I find Sha 're one day , ... .. what are the chances she 's ever gonna be the same again ? Your endorphin level was sky - high when we came back . Now you 're coming down . The effects of the sarcophagus are like a narcotic , Daniel . Yeah . That makes you smarter , stronger , feel great . What the hell is so wrong with it ? I think it 's partly what made the Goa 'uld as bad as they are . How ? Who knows ? It 's Goa 'uld technology , Daniel . Maybe its healing effects alter your brain chemistry , ... .. increase adrenaline , making you aggressive and irrational . Pyrus probably used to be a decent man . Look at yourself . It 's like you need a fix . You only used it a few times and already it 's changed you . We can 't just leave it there . We have to study it . We can 't go back either . I 'm going . She used us to get you addicted . You 've never really known what love is . See , the Daniel I know would never have said that . - What are you saying , Captain ? - He needs to be confined . He 's addicted to the effects ... What 's this ? - It 's my resignation . - Oh , please ! I request permission to go through the gate to P3R - 636 . - Request denied ! - I wasn 't asking you ! - Daniel ! - Dr Jackson ? He 's unconscious . This is General Hammond . Code Red medical emergency in my office . I gave him a sedative . His test results were all over the place . Liver function , kidneys , endorphins , electrolytes ... - There 's muscle deterioration . - Whatever . What 's goin ' on with him ? I have no idea . The most I can do is try and treat the symptoms , ... .. but he seems to be going through some massive physical withdrawal . I have to go back ! You 're killing me ! Stop killing me ! Calm down ! Argh ... It 's like all of his cells have lost the ability to function properly and it 's getting worse . - There 's nothing you can do ? - I need time . The sarcophagus will keep him alive . We can 't let him go back . That thing will screw him up and we 'll lose him anyway . The memories that Jolinar left in my mind ... .. told me the sarcophagus will take away everything he is . - What choice do we have ? - We wait it out . Just ... a little longer . - Hey . - How 's he doin ' ? Well , I can 't say for sure , but I think maybe the worst is over . His blood work 's encouraging . Body temperature 's coming down , pulse is normal , BP 120 over 80 . So we made the right call . His cellular function is starting to take back control . The next few hours should tell . It 's time for another dose of sedative . OK , Daniel ... Ohh ! Stand down ! I 'm OK . Go . Jesus ! Dammit ! Daniel ! Are you trying to kill me ? You 're trying to kill me . There 'll be guards here in 30 seconds . I 'm going back . You don 't have to . Fraiser says you 're getting better . - You 're lying ! - Why would I do that ? Daniel ! God ... What are you gonna do , Daniel ? You wanna kill me ? Oh , God , look at you . I know what this is . I know what it 's like . You can get through it . No ... The probe 's data indicates P3H - 826 is a viable next mission for SG-1 , sir . I have another suggestion . I think we should go back to P3R - 636 . But before you say anything , just hear me out . There are thousands of innocent humans there who we could free from slavery . Shyla cannot free her people without great risk . Well , we have to offer her alternatives . New ways to mine the naqahdah . The Goa 'uld may not notice if shipments stop . Preliminary tests indicate countless military and scientific applications ... .. for the raw ore . Might be a good reason to try , sir . Try what ? The last time , you were enslaved in that mine . Look , you want access to the mine , but you don 't wanna send troops in . I 'm offering you a shot at a diplomatic solution . Please , Jack . I need to take the chance . We can back him up , sir . I 'd like Daniel back on the team . I did not believe you would ever return . I 'm sorry ... about your father . About everything . The sarcophagus could not help him any more . You never did love me , did you ? I wouldn 't be here if I didn 't care . I don 't deserve to live after what I 've done to you . Yes , you do . Your people need you . You may still be able to lead them without turning into what your father became . How ? You can 't use this any more . It 's gonna be bad , ... .. trust me . But you don 't have to do this alone .

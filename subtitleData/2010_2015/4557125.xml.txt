 '13 Bannerman Road is where Sarah Jane Smith lives . 'It 's home to things way beyond your imagination . 'There 's an extra-terrestrial super computer in the wall , 'her son , a genetically engineered boy genius , 'a schoolgirl investigator across the road , 'and a whole universe of adventure , 'right here on the doorstep . ' Ready ? Always . There 's nobody . It 's the whole world . Everybody 's gone . Why are aliens more likely to single us out more than anyone else ? There 's got to be someone else . There 's got to be . Stop ! Oi ! There ! It was a kid ! Get away from me ! How did you get in here ? There must be a reason why there 's only three of us left . Gavin , have you ever heard anything like this before ? Gavin ! What is that ? The biggest crisis ever and it 's just us . Maybe today 's the day it all comes back to bite us on the bum . Come on ! Clyde ! There 's this big robot thing ... Yeah , I saw it ! Big and yellow . Big and red ! Then there 's two ! I think they 've got guns in their fingers . Gavin saved me . Well , look , the other one nearly got me ... Saved you how ? I chucked a bin at it . That 's my boy ! Seeing those robots though , relief , isn 't it ? Not exactly what I was thinking , no . At least it 's something we can see , something we can deal with . How are we supposed to " deal with " two big robots ? Chuck a few more bins ? Have you seen this ? What is it ? You believe us now , then ? You 're not scared of us ? You 're more normal than these things are . Is this their language ? No , it 's more like maths . Equations . Maybe that is their language . They 're robots , what do you expect them to speak , Spanish ? If it is a signal , who 's it for ? There 's only us . Maybe it is for us . Gavin , you don 't understand this , do you ? Of course not ! I don 't know anything about this stuff . OK , which way did they go ? Oh , er , up there . All right , we follow them . Wait , what ? They 'll kill us ! We 've got to track them . If they landed nearby , they might be going back to base , some sort of spaceship . We need to get away from them ! The more we learn about them , the more we understand , the better chance we 've got . You don 't have to come . Wait back here for us . No ! What if you need saving again ? No sign of them . Oh , that suits me . Well , then we split up . No way ! We 're staying together . Which way first ? They could have gone anywhere . OK , we need to think . Back to HQ ? Yeah . This is HQ ? OK , so there are robots . Big , alien , red and yellow robots . But do you know what ? I 'm sure we 're about to find out . This whole thing now makes even less sense than it did before there were any robots ! It never made sense ! These robots can clear everybody out of the whole world , except for the three of us . The leftovers . And now they 've come looking for us . But with all their amazing power and technology , they can 't find us ? You 'd think they 'd have sensors or whatever , to track us down . We could do it with the stuff in the attic . So why can 't they ? Attic ? What attic ? If Luke was here , he 'd say " look at the logic " . Because if we 've travelled in time ... Sarah Jane got taken . She 's done more time travel than anyone . Time travel ! Oh , might have guessed . Except Sarah Jane travelled through time in a phone box . We went through a temporal fissure . Oh , shut up ! It 's all true . So ... it 's not that . Space travel , Gavin ? You 've travelled in space and time ? OK , right . I believe you ( ! ) We 've been in the Tardis ! The what-dis ? It would really help if you spoke English . The phone box . But again , Sarah Jane has , Gavin hasn 't . What applies to us , but not to Sarah Jane ? There 's nothing ! Wait a minute . There is one thing , something that only happened to you and me . Come on , what ? We got grounded by the Judoon . You keep saying these really stupid words ! If you 're so clever , why can 't you just go out and stop the robots ? You and me , we were grounded , not Sarah Jane and not Luke ! That 's it ! No , they slapped a ticket on us , we can 't leave Earth . When everyone else got taken , the robots legally had to leave us behind ? Because they didn 't want to get in trouble with the Judoon . Sensible robots ! But you 've never met any Judoon , though . Why do you keep asking me this ? I 'm 13 years old , I go to school , I do my homework , I watch telly , I eat fish fingers ! I 'm not important and I 'm not special . I 'm normal . If he 's right and the Judoon thing 's right , then sticking with us is the most dangerous thing he could do . Because they 're after us . Out ! Run ! It 's locked ! Come on ! Come on ! Gavin , go ! This is not your fight ! Go where ? Just run ! Get away ! Hide ! Go ! What do we do ? What do we do ? If I 've ever let you down , I 'm sorry ! Split up . I 'll lead them off . Love you , Mum . Clyde ? No . Please ... Clyde , you never let me down . What ? MECHANICAL RUMBLING What ? MECHANICAL RUMBLING I 'm not getting you , mate . No comprendo ! RUMBLES OK , you think about that , I 'm going to go for a walk . Oh , you 're coming too , are you ? I do not understand you . What does that mean ? Oh , Clyde ! Rani ! Oh ! They don 't want to kill us ! I know . But what do they want ? Rani . Clyde . Robots . Ra-ni . Yes ! Rani ! Ra-ni . Ra-ni . We could be here for years ! Hold on . Try this . Input . Input . " Jordan love rat shock . Labour backbencher . " Lady Gaga . Aston Villa striker . Partly cloudy . " Brilliant ! They 've got the language , they can communicate with us . OK , we do not understand that . Tell us what that means . Translate it . It 's a countdown . That 's what it was all along ? It must be . 23 minutes to what ? I don 't like countdowns . There 's never anything good at the end of a countdown . Except New Year 's and even that 's rubbish . I 'm sorry , I 'm scared . I make stupid jokes when I 'm scared . Yeah , I never noticed ( ! ) Look , what does that mean ? Give us air . Give us air . Why do you need our air ? We can 't give you the air , we need it to breathe ! And even if we could , we wouldn 't . Give us air . Where is everyone ? Warp shunt . Human species suspended . Sub-dimension . Then they 're all alive ? Yes . Give us air . You 're robots , you don 't need to breathe ! No air - shunt closes . No human species return . The countdown ! If we don 't give them our air by zero , the human race doesn 't come back . Ever ! That is correct . Just when I was starting to like you ... But why ? Give us air . Bring us air . Give us the sun . Ah , you want the sun too ? You don 't ask for much , do you ? Give us sun and air . Wait ! Not sun and air - son and heir ! What are you saying ? THE son and THE heir . Like Prince Charles , he 's the son and the heir of the Queen . You can definitely have Prince Charles ! Take Camilla too , if you want . Give us prince . Clyde ! No , you 're not the prince , but Gavin might be ! The prince of their planet , the son and the heir . They 've come to get him ! Gavin ? What ? Gavin 's dad ... he ran off . What if he ran off back to their planet ? What , you mean his mum , she ... ? Mm-hm . His dad was an alien king ? King is dead . King 's brother is dead . Give us the son and heir . The only thing that makes sense of all this . Gavin 's their king , they 've come to get him ! He is new king . He will rule . Riches and power . He will give the order to return human race . And the prince , does he know he 's the prince ? Does he know about this ? Information was sent to him . The energy trace last night ! He never got it . He knows nothing about this ! He 's the only one that can bring everyone back . We sent him away . What have we done ? Gavin 's place ! Come on ! Gavin ? Gavin ! Where is he ? We 've got to go back down . Tell the robots we need more time . They don 't care about us , our planet , anybody ! I don 't think they 're evil , they 're just thick . How do you mean ? It 's like if Prince Harry got captured abroad somewhere , the government would send the army in to go get him . They wouldn 't care who got hurt . See , they 're royal robots , protocol and all that . The mission 's gone wrong , but they don 't know how to adapt . They 're programmed to bring everyone back , but only when they 've got Gavin ? Yes . That warp shunt thing 's only good for another ... 15 minutes . We 've got to find him ! 15 minutes ! Where do we start ? Where would he go ? Where would you go if it was you ? Somewhere I felt safe . Home . I don 't think he feels safe here . Like I said , this place ... it 's their home , his aunt and uncle 's . So where 's he gone ? Look . Gavin 's mum , must be . And maybe that 's his dad - the old king . Gavin 's diary ! You can 't read that . We 've got to ! It 's the end of the world and all that . Nothing , nothing .. Ooh , bad poems , bad poems . Wait , what 's this ? " Went to the circle " , and again here , " the circle " . What 's the circle ? The Circle ! Nature reserve place , we went there on a school trip . The most boring day of my life , yeah . Nature , animals - he 's in to all that stuff . He 's five minutes away , we can make it , come on ! Follow us ! Quickly ! He 's here ! Gavin ? Look , split up . Go that way . Gavin ! There he is . Gavin ! What 've you done ? Why are they here ? You told me to get away ! Gavin , we were wrong . We were wrong and you were wrong . It turns out you 're really important . In fact , you 're the most important person on this planet . You just didn 't know it . Rani , three minutes ! You 've got to listen ! Get off me ! I told you , I 'm nothing ! Where is the son and heir ? Right there ! They 're after me ? And you 're helping them ? There is nobody there . Are you blind ? He 's right there ! We 've got 2 minutes 45 ! You 've got to listen to me . Your dad , he was an alien , an alien king ! And they ... they want you to be their new king . I never even knew my dad ! Think ! Tell us everything you know about your dad . I don 't know anything , I keep telling you this . My mum didn 't like talking about him . She said maybe when I was older . She died before she could tell you . Where is the son and heir ? Think . They can 't see you , something is stopping them from seeing you , something to do with your dad . 2 minutes 15 ! Hold on . My mum gave me this , she said my dad gave it to her ... to protect me . That must be it ! To shield what you are , your alien half , to give you a normal life . Please , Gavin , listen to us , trust us . Just take off that ring ! W-W-What are they going to do to me ? Gavin , please ! You can save everyone , just take off the ring ! The son and heir . Bio-damper shielded him . That 's why he didn 't get the message last night . Send it again . Tell him who he is ! Come on ! It 's true . It 's all true . Yep . Rani , they want me . They need me . No-one ever wanted me before . I am the most important person on the planet ! Well , it 's just the three of us ... Shh ! And on that planet , too . My home . My real home . It 's got to be your choice to go . I 've made my choice . Why would I stay here ? There 's a whole new world waiting for me , halfway across the universe . My planet . So beautiful , so ... peaceful . Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . We 've got 1 minute 15 , Your Highness ! So if you could just make the order and bring everyone back ? Your king commands you . Our king commands us . Take me home and bring the humans back to earth . Clyde , Rani , thank you . Earth was never my home , not really . But it is your home and you 're lucky to have people that love you here . Before I go , I now name you Lord Clyde and you Lady Rani . We 've been gonged ! Lady Rani ? Yeah , that 'll do ! 35 seconds , come on ! Come on , come on , bring them back ! We 've only got ten seconds . It was all for nothing ! We were too late ! What if the power failed ? Come on . Please ! Clyde , get out of the road ! HORN BLARES Yes ! You know for a minute there , I thought it was just going to be me and you . Forever . Yeah . Relief ! Gita , calm down . Give it ten more minutes , then we 'll call the police . Yes , I know . Hold on ... It 's her ! Calm down , Gita . See you when you 're back here . Where 've you been ? Oh , Dad ! Yes ! Are you OK ? I 'm fine . Look at you , my dad . You weren 't in your bed , Sarah Jane hasn 't heard from you , your Mum 's gone out searching ... I 'm really sorry . Are you sure everything 's OK ? Er , yeah . Why ? Is everything OK with you ? Yes . No . Rani ... An hour and a half , it just ... jumped . It was seven o 'clock , then suddenly , it 's half past eight . Really ? No ! Go on , you 're winding me up . It was on the news , we saw it . Then we couldn 't find you . Wait , hang on ... You thought this was something to do with me ? We didn 't know what to think any more . Rani , so many strange things have happened since we 've moved here . Tell me where you were , who you were with ? I was ... at ... Honestly , come on , I 'm your dad . We don 't have secrets . OK . Well , I , erm ... I was with Clyde . Oh , there 's a surprise . Yes , Mum , I 'm fine , all right ? Everything 's OK . I 'll explain everything later , I promise . Right , bye . Somehow ... Hello , sir . Only a sir , eh ? You know , some people are lords ... And what 's that supposed to mean ? No , it 's OK , Luke , I think they 're here ! I 'll call you later . Oh , Clyde ! Rani ! Right , where were you ? I was helping Lord Clyde with his homework . He 's got Great Expectations too . There was no signal , the network must have gone down . Lord Clyde ? Tell you later . You scared the life out of me , Rani . Oh , there we are , then . Panic over . I knew there 'd be a perfectly normal explanation . There always is , isn 't there ? For an hour and a half to have gone missing ? I swear there 's something odd about this road . Sarah Jane ? Mmm , yes ? Sorry to have put you out . Oh , no problem . As long as everyone 's safe and sound . Yes , Clyde can tell me all about it . Bye , Haresh . Bye . Well , I 'd better go get ready for school . Love you . Still don 't know what you see in that Langer boy ! Mr Smith 's fixed the official records . Gavin 's moved to Australia . I reckon the aunt and uncle will be glad to see the back of him . Yeah , he was happy getting away from them . You two were brilliant . Worked it out all by yourselves . Only because you showed us how to . You like , trained us . Yeah , you 're the Commander , we 're just the space cadets . Yeah , well , I 'm not sure I like that . If we 'd never met you , we would have been stuffed . If you 'd never met me , got grounded by the Judoon , you wouldn 't have been in danger in the first place . Sarah Jane , you 're like the best thing that ever happened to us . Yeah . When I was a kid , I thought I 'd never do anything . End up nowhere , just ... dossing about . I never saw all of this coming . One day , if it all stops , I don 't want you ending up alone , like I used to be . Hey , after today I can tell you straight , you 've got no idea what it 's like being alone . Fair point . Right . I 'm getting pizza menus . Reward for saving the human race . On me . We 're not alone though , are we ? No . We 've got each other . Not a bad morning 's work , my lord ! Indeed , my ladyship . Score one up for the hangers-on ! The tapestry of Time is a fragile thing . But you understand that , don 't you , Sarah Jane ? How do you know my name ? Oh , I know a great many things . Who are you , and what do you want ? I need your help to save the world . This is a time window , Sarah Jane . Then how do we get back ? There is no choice in the matter . You have until the sands run out ... or this world is doomed . So , this is like 1939 or something ? 7th of June , 1941 . Now keep your voice down . Why , what are you looking at ? Germans . Nazis ? Is this Buckingham Palace ? 'Tis the Tower of London . At last , I have you trapped ! We had best find more suitable attire for the Queen 's new lady-in-waiting . What year is this ? 1889 . VOICES ECHO No such thing as ghosts , you say ? Ta-da ! We cannot keep the Time Window open much longer . It 's dead . Eight o 'clock . That 's it , that 's when they say it starts ! If Sarah Jane and her friends do not return soon , they 'll be trapped in the past ! For ever ! Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd E-mail subtitling @ bbc.co.uk

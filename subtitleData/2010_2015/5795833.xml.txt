He saw a news story and said , " Janus , you 're all gonna die . " It was USNC News , an American network , which means we can 't get it online . - So we need to break into their offices . - What ? We need to steal it and show it to Anton , then we go and talk to Dugdale . Break in ? What are you on ? And fucking Dugdale 's with them . - I don 't believe he is . - And your judgment 's so great . - What does that mean ? - Mm . No , no , come on . Let 's have it out . - You called Milner . - Oh , here we go . After everyone saying , " Don 't call Milner , don 't call Milner , " you called Milner . - It was a mistake . - Was it ? Was it , lan ?

Well , let 's face it , you 're not into me any more , are you ? No . No , I am not . Right . Can I ask why ? Ask your pal . Donaldson . Fuck 's sake ! Why 's Anton drawing on my Utopia ? It 's time you knew something . But you can 't tell anyone this , Grant , all right ? Anton is Philip Carvel . Nah . What , Anton ? Mad Anton ? Do you remember anything else about that story ? Are you sure it wasn 't ... it wasn 't about the vaccine or V Day ? Nah , it was just about a cat on a fucking Hoover . Anton went nuts . Right , I 'm going . Fuck this . I can 't just sit here .

We 're making the vaccine with Janus in it . If there 's anything wrong ... He put it inside Jessica , Wilson . He would never harm her . He loved her . And you 're willing to gamble everything on that love ? Yes . Yes , of course I am . Don 't you understand yet ? ( SIGHS ) I need you , Wilson . You . This whole thing comes down to the kind of people we are . You , me , Philip . What are you saying ? I don 't get this . I don 't get what you 're trying ... To get the manuscript , we killed eight children . We went into a school , shot them dead , and blamed it on Grant . I made that choice , that plan . What do you think of that ? Why are you telling me this ? There 's someone I need you to meet . Philip ? Philip . Please . Look , we know you speak English , so bloody speak it now ! Why did they put that number on his arm ?

That 's when fish stocks run out . Do you fucking get that ? - Course . It 's ... - 2080 , end of gas . 2090 , end of oil . Those figures don 't come from Greenpeace or Friends of the fucking Earth . They come from BP . If demand for fertiliser increases at current rates , phosphates end this century , and that means no food . - I know . You don 't have to tell me . - Do you ? Because I don 't think you do . If you really knew , you 'd understand that we have no choice . You 're just like Philip . You can 't let go of morality . But what we must do puts us beyond morality . - ( PEOPLE CHATTER ) - What are we doing here ? MILNER : This is Paul . What do you do , Paul ? - I 'm assistant manager at ... - Tell Wilson what you really do . Paul is one of three people trained to do one very , very special thing . It 's OK . Tell him everything . If I am chosen , I will receive a call . The moment I do , I shall walk out of my life . I will go into hiding until just nine days before V Day , when I will go to a car park in Denham . A car will be waiting . It has been adapted to store a canister that will have been slowly coming down in temperature for nearly 90 days . When I get there , what 's inside the canister will be thawed , ready for release . MILNER : Do you know what 's inside ? Yeah . Inside is an extremely deadly variant of Russian influenza . I will take it to a crop-duster at Denham airfield , which I 'll fly over a 35-square-mile area , releasing the virus onto those below . I will repeat this at four other as-of-yet ... undisclosed locations all over the world . Does it bother you that we 're going to release a deadly virus ? Well , we have a vaccine . Many will die before it works . You will have killed them . But I will have saved everyone . Are you worried about dying ? Chances are you will be infected . No , I 'm not worried about dying at all . I 'm going to save the world . ( TAP WATER RUNS ) - ( WATER OFF ) - ( SIGHS ) ( SHE LAUGHS ) You should see your face . You 're worried Becky 'll find out ? I won 't tell . Why are you here , Jessica ? - Is Dugdale with them ? - No . He 's just doing what he has to . And I came looking for you . Where did you get the scars ? I , erm ... I should never have brought the manuscript to Milner . Janus wasn 't in Utopia . It was in me . I was the first person to get the vaccine . My own dad did that to me . Your dad ? You mean Philip Carvel ? ( CHUCKLES ) So you 've nothing to worry about , lan . I 'm sterile . Shall we do it again ? What is wrong with you ? Do you want some eggs ? I 'll make some eggs . ( RUSSIAN ACCENT ON PHONE ) OK . Car pick you up in five minutes . - ( LINE GOES DEAD ) - ( HE BREATHES DEEPLY ) ( SHE SIGHS ) How many will die ? Typically , mortality in a flu virus comes in waves . We hope the vaccine will kick in on the first wave and the virus will be eradicated . ( SHE SIGHS ) First wave , 1,200 , 1,500 people . If it goes into the second wave , it will almost certainly be tens of thousands . God . Jesus Christ , Milner . MILNER : But think what we will have done , Wilson . This can 't be the only way . We 've been planning this for 30 years . If there was another way , we 'd know . I 've told you everything . You need to tell me if you can live with this . Can you live with this ? Wilson , can you live with ... I need you to say it . Yes . I can live with this . Where did you get this man ? Fuck 's it got to do with you ? You 're the translator . Translate . Grant . He 's ... our neighbour . He 's ill . - MARIUS : Neighbour ? - BECKY : Mm-hm . MARIUS : Live next door to your nice unfinished hotel ? Why not call 999 ? We 'll give you L500 cash . Pleased to meet you . My name is Marius . Let us begin . O del si lasho . That not Romanian . That Romani . Romani , language of the Roma people . Gypsy people , yes ? You racist bastards . You think all Roma is from Romania . Is not . Roma many places . Bulgaria , Poland , Spain . Romani different language , like Welsh to English . Do you speak fucking Welsh ? - Yeah , I do , actually . - Doesn 't matter . - But ... - You still racist . ... he was speaking Romanian . ( TABLE CLINKS ) Vorbesti Romaneste ? Da , eu vorbesc limba Româna . This Roma is from Romania . Coincidence . You still racist . What 's going on ? Becky found a way to speak to Anton , through twat-face . Is twat-face me ? ( BIRDSONG ) ( DOOR SHUTS ) Lan was here . What ? Here ? What ... what did he want ? Who knows what that boy wants ? Are you OK , Jessica ? It 's Milner . Milner 's Mr Rabbit . I 'm sorry . I can 't bear everything on my own . I need someone to trust . ( DOOR SLAMS ) ( HE SIGHS ) ( SIGHS ) BECKY : You OK ? You seem odd . I 'm not odd . Odd ? No , I 'm fine . Why ? Well , you ... you haven 't busted my nuts about bringing Marius here , for a start . Look , are we gonna do this ? ( MARIUS SIGHS ) This man is a survivor ? Yes , he is . Ask him about it . - De unde ai luat asta ? - Am fost in Be ³ ¿ ec . Fuck . Be ³ ¿ ec concentration camp . Very bad for Roma people , very bad . Familia mea , mama , fratii , verii - toti omorati . Mother , father , brothers , cousins - whole family , all killed . - ( MURMURS ) - BECKY : Jesus Christ . MARIUS TRANSLATES : He always hear the hissing ... - La sfârsitul razboiului ... ... gas released . End of war , he break incinerator . Sabotage , yes ? ( ANTON SPEAKS ROMANIAN ) So , they take out the bodies , dump the bodies in the wood . He hide in bodies . Two days . He five years old . Am crescut , am vrut sa imi folosesc mintea pentru face ca asa ... Grow up ... want use mind , make never happen again . - Jesus , who is this guy ? - ( SPEAKS ROMANIAN ) Just carry on . ( SPEAKS ROMANIAN ) - ( CHUCKLES ) - But then he meet ... Mr Rabbit ? - ( SPEAKS ROMANIAN ) - Is that right , Mr Rabbit ? - He say she was incredible . - IAN : She ? - Mr Rabbit was a man . - MARIUS : No . - ( SPEAKS ROMANIAN ) - He was feminine . They work together , make a thing that solve ... all world 's problems ? Is it Janus ? You made Janus ? BECKY : And does Janus work , Anton ? Yes , it will work perfectly . Fuck . He speaks English ? But not in the way she thinks . She said we couldn 't choose . I made an adjustment . ( SIGHS ) I ... I wanted to help evolution , you see . I chose . You mean a race ? You chose a race ? I did . ( WHISPERS ) Oh , God , I did . And which race did you choose ? ( WHISPERING IN HIS HEAD ) ( SPEAKS ROMANIAN ) ( WHISPERING IN ANTON 'S HEAD ) You show him cat dressed like shark ? Panj familii ! - What the fuck ? - Panj familii ! - What does that mean , " panj familii " ? - I don 't know . Familii means " families " . Panj is Romani , it means " five " . Five families . - And what does " five families " mean ? - Why the fuck you ask me ? - Look , that 's where he freaked . - Yeah ? Look at the bottom . Man kills his family - Hartwell , Georgia . Hang on . There was a story like that here as well . A man killed his family out of the blue . Five families . So there 's three more ? OK , you guys are fucking freaking me out . - What the fuck is going on ? - ANTON : Oh , no . No , no , no , no . Philip is with lan . This is how we 're going to get him . The guards here are Ml5 , by the way . They know nothing about us . ( WILSON 'S SHOES SQUEAK ) ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACH ) ( HE GASPS ) MILNER : Hello , Roy . My name is Milner . ( ROY BREATHES FAST ) Where 's your brother ? Where 's lan ? ROY : I don 't know . I 've no idea . - MILNER : Are you sure , Roy ? - ROY : Yes . Why am I here ? I 'm in handcuffs . They put a hood on me . MILNER : Did Ian say anything about me , Roy ? For example , did he say to you , " Milner is Mr Rabbit " ? - What are you doing ? - ROY : No . No , he never said that . MILNER : Are you sure ? He never used the phrase , " Milner is Mr Rabbit " ? No . Who 's ... who 's Mr Rabbit ? Keep questioning , but in one hour set him free . Send him home . ( WILSON PANTS ) Why did you do that ? - You told him that you were Mr ... - We need Philip . He 's with lan . Roy has no idea where his brother is . But when lan discovers that we 've killed Roy ... Well , he has a mother . Killed ? No , wait . Just hang on a minute ! In a few days , I 'm going to call either Paul or one of the other two . I 'll give a command , a command that only I know , and in about 90 days that person will release the most deadly flu this world has ever seen . Everyone will take the vaccine . Everyone will willingly take Janus . It 'll be chaos , it will , but in less than 100 years there 'll be no more than 500 million people on this planet . We will have created Utopia . But if those three men walk out of that room knowing who I am then in all probability , all of that disappears . Hey . No , look , Milner . Can ... Can we just talk about this a minute ? Cos I ... I can 't ... I need you , Wilson . I need someone . I wish I could leave you as that beautiful boy that I met , but I can 't . No , I ... I can 't . I just ... I just can 't . MILNER : I 've been making decisions like this for 40 years . Every day . This decision , I 'm leaving with you . I nicked a bunch of Reuters files with the same date on . There 's one here called the global news index . It catalogues all stories . What do I look up ? Er ... family annihilation ? Right , there 's five . All on the same day . The one here was in a place called Denham , off the M25 . Then the one in America , then killings in Roseira , Brazil , Ratanda , South Africa , and Laishui near Beijing . I was working with Donaldson . Last time , when this happened . He wanted the manuscript . He has access to an experimental drug , Thoraxin , that works on Deel 's . He said if that I didn 't get him what he wanted , then I wouldn 't have the drugs . But at ... at the last minute I told him to go fuck himself , and I had that fit , and I 'm so sorry that I haven 't told you and I 've regretted it for so long . I just wanted everything to be out in the open between us , OK ? Everything . GRANT : Nice jacket . How come a knob-face like you has suddenly grown a sense ... Grant , for fuck 's sake ! We 're doing something . Will you just piss off ? Where did that come from ? ( BREATHES FAST ) Look , Grant , I 'm sorry , I ... Yeah ? Sorry , is it ? You made me a killer . Everyone still thinks I did it . - And then you made me dead , lan . - Grant , put the gun ... - No . - ( GUN COCKS ) You don 't tell me what to do no more . No-one does . Stay very still , mate . Stay very fucking still . ( BREATHES FAST ) ( GRANT PANTS ) - ( BIRDSONG OUTSIDE ) - They 've got Jen and Alice . They 've got my family . Michael ? - I 'm gonna help you get your family back . - ( HE SNIFFS ) - ( WHISPERS ) I promise . - ( HE SNIFFS ) ( KNOCK AT DOOR ) I 'll go . I 'll slip out the back . I 'll come back tomorrow . ( SNIFFS ) ( BIRDSONG ) Michael . How lovely to see you . - I wasn 't expecting to see you . - ( CHUCKLES ) Well , no , of course not . Er ... I 'm sorry to barge in , Michael . It ... it 's just ... I 'm looking for lan . Lan ? Why ... why do you want lan ? Why ? ! - He 's wanted for murder , Michael . - Oh , yeah , yeah , of course . - Had you forgotten ? - I had . I 'd fucking ... What an idiot . Oh , so much on your plate . Lan believes The Network are running again . The person he killed he thought was with them . Look , I 've tried everywhere else . I thought there was a remote chance he 'd come to you . No , no , no , he 's not been here . ( SIGHS ) I didn 't think so . It 's just I 'm getting rather desperate . Well , that 's it , really . I 'll be off , leave you to it . Actually , could I have some water ? I 'll get it . Kitchen through here ? Yeah . Are you religious , Michael ? No . No , not ... not at all . Thought not . Me neither . JESSICA : Don 't even fucking blink . ( METAL SCRAPES ) What , here ? No , don 't be silly . But ... - But I have things to do . - Yeah . - That 's why I 'm killing you . - Don 't be silly , Jessica . - This isn 't ... I mean , this ... - It is . It really is . Your father 's alive . ( MILNER SIGHS ) Look at me . Look at me , Jessica . I 'm not lying . You can see that . He 's with lan . Lan has Philip . Let 's go see him . Together . When you kill , you don 't feel nothing , do you ? No . For me it 's like unscrewing a bottle to get to the water . Yeah . ( ARBY WHEEZES ) And no-one fucks with you . They do . They just do it different . Will you teach me to shoot ? Yes . Will you teach me to kill ? No , I don 't think I will . Where are the others ? Up there , talking to Anton , now they 've figured out who he is . What do you mean , who he is ? Who is Anton ? I 'm ... not really supposed to say . ( WHISPERING IN HIS HEAD ) Look at this - Hartwell , Georgia , where the American bloke killed his family . Middle of fucking nowhere . The only thing that 's interesting is that it has an airfield . Light aircraft , crop-dusters , that sort of thing . - OK . - And it 's 80 miles from Atlanta airport , the busiest airport in the world . It 's the same with Denham . It has a tiny airfield , but it 's en route to Heathrow and Gatwick . It ... it 's the same with all these places . If you were going to spread flu , that 's how you 'd do it . Crop-dusters in the middle of nowhere , but en route to some of the busiest airports in the world . Where these families were killed , that 's where they 're releasing the virus from . But why ... why kill families ? Why ... why kill innocent ... To cover our tracks . They are sleeper agents . Trained . Or brainwashed . Their job is to tend the virus . When they get the call , they place it in a designated location , then they kill themselves and their families . All traces gone . That 's how we work , you see . Families . Children . We are appalling . ( BREATHES FAST ) Dovada . Dovada . - Dovada . - What does that mean , " dovada " ? Dovada means " proof " . It means " proof " .

 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... You were dead for ... days . - I wanted to die . - And we should have let you . We gave you a pleasant memory of a beautiful island . You spent no time at the Academy . I didn 't go to your S.H.I.E.L.D. Hogwarts or whatever . And an 0-8-4 is ... ? An object of unknown origin . Kind of like you . Skye 's trying to I.D. the agent that dropped her off at the orphanage . - We agreed to protect her from the truth . - You have to decide why you 're here . If you can 't put aside your personal attachments , then you shouldn 't be here . I completely blew the question on Von Neumann 's entropy . Freaking thermodynamics . [ chuckles ] Test 's over , Callie . Just let it go . Yeah , that 's easy for you to say . You probably aced it . What you need is a little distraction . - This will distract me just fine . - Well , suit yourself . Whoo ! Come on , Callie ! Live a little ! [ laughs ] Girl : What are you waiting for ? [ laughs ] Callie , relax ! Girl : Guess , we 've earned this . Come on , have some fun , Callie . Girl : Come on , take it on ! [ laughs ] [ cracking ] Guys ... get out . They can 't bust us for coming in here ! Get out now ! No ! Get it off me ! Aah ! Seth , pull ! I 'm trying ! Aah ! Aah ! My leg ! Get it off me ! [ grunting ] Aah ! [ breathing heavily ] 1x12 - Seeds Simmons : There is nothing more unsettling , being a part of something so horrible , completely unaware . The Cadet could have died . We drew up those concepts years ago . We didn 't know they 'd be applied in that way . Is this the device they found in the frozen pool ? Correction ... the instantly frozen indoor pool . It seems like it was planted in the filter days before , like someone was waiting for those specific Cadets . Well , as far as they can tell , the device uses a crystalline nucleation process she designed . And a delivery mechanism he invented . That 's why we 're being asked to consult on the investigation . - So we 're going to the Academy ? - Science and technology division . Cadets are pretty shaken up over what happened . Agent Weaver asked if you two could speak to the student body - about potentiality to calm them down . - Of course . The talk . We 've all heard the talk . - I haven 't . - I guess you will . Well , I 've heard a lot about the Academy . I 'm excited to finally see it . Me , too . Never been to Sci-Tech before . Never ? Huh . The different S.H.I.E.L.D. academies don 't interact ? [ scoffs ] Ward : Not much . Academy of communications does , but they 're the biggest and focused on data analysis . - It 's the easiest to get into . - Boring . - That 's where you 'd be , Skye . - Thanks . Ward : Operations is the most aggressive program . More people wash out of operations than the other academies . So which one 's the hardest to get into ? I 'm picking up on the rivalry between sciences and operations . Are you and Coulson past all that , or you gonna help Ward steal their mascot ? We 're not going . After we drop you off , Coulson and I have other matters to attend to . [ footsteps depart ] Coulson hasn 't come out of his office in awhile . - Do you think he 's all right ? - We saw him at a low . It 's not easy for anybody . But Coulson 's tough as they come . He 'll be good . Just give him time . And while he takes that time , it 's on us to figure out what 's going on at the Academy . Simmons : This was the SSR facility before S.H.I.E.L.D. was even founded . " SSR " stands for ... Strategic scientific reserve . Yeah , I know . Is this where you got all your PHDs ? Oh , no , you need at least one to get through the door . Is science and technology what you imagined , Agent Ward ? Yep ... no uniforms , no rope course , no defined muscularity on anyone . No marching in place , no I.Q.s in double digits . There they are . So good to see you . - You look as lovely as ever . - I concur . Thank you . Agent Ward . Pleasure to have you , sir . Agent Weaver . There 's a list of suspects ? Based on the level of intelligence it would take to put a device together like the one we found , we 've narrowed it down to the top 10 % of our Cadets . I 'm worried there 's a bad seed . Ops and sciences have differences , but both have to be careful about what we call " bad seeds , " people who want to use the tools we give them for ... " Bad seed " isn 't a S.H.I.E.L.D. term , Ward , just a term . I know you 've already questioned the victim , but I have a few questions I 'd like to ask him myself . I 'll arrange for you to talk to Seth Dormer when he 's out of class . Now , if you 'll excuse me , I 'd like to get Agents Fitz and Simmons settled into the lecture hall . Skye : Look at them ... the popular kids . - Who knew ? - I did . Come on . While we have a minute , I think there 's something you 'll want to see . - Skye : The Wall of valor . - Ward : So you 've read about it ? Every S.H.I.E.L.D. facility has a memorial to the agents lost in the line of duty . S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s history can be traced on walls like this . Huh . - " Bucky " Barnes . - Puts it in perspective ... what we do . Must make you guys proud ... all this history . Just wish I was a part of it . It 's not self-pity , really . I 'm just saying everyone here has earned this . They deserve it . I hacked my way in ... feels like I cheated . All you need to join is a dedication to the greater good . Coulson saw that in you the moment he met you . May : [ sighs ] - You have got to put that away . - How can I ? You read it . And you haven 't stopped reading it . I just can 't get my head around it . I remember what happened ... the pain ... - but I also remember Tahiti . It 's ... - What 's in that file ... it 's the truth . Says who ? - Director Fury . - If I hadn 't asked , he 'd have kept it from me , kept me from knowing . And now that you know , you feel better ? Put it away . [ sighs ] You want to tell me why we 're flying to Mexico City ? To get your head working on something else . I 've been looking into Skye 's past , like you asked , into the agent who dropped her off at the orphanage . Agent Avery . She was killed . But her partner wasn 't . He disappeared . - Richard Lumley . - Went off-grid 23 years ago , - day after Avery was crossed off . - He 's resurfaced ? A few days ago , a Mexican teenager posted a selfie on his facebook page ... managed to capture our guy leaving a grocery store in the background . If he 's good enough to avoid S.H.I.E.L.D. all these years , - he 'll know . - And he 'll be on the move . We have a short window to intercept . - He may have killed Agent Avery . - Or wanted to avoid the same fate . Find him , we find out . How long till we touch down ? 40 minutes . I 'll gas the car . Today , we 're proud to welcome back two of S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy 's finest , our youngest graduates to date . You know their names . Please join me in welcoming Agent Leopold Fitz and Agent Jemma Simmons . [ applause ] Thank you , Agent Weaver . It 's nice to be back . Unfortunately , it has to be under these circumstances . Fitz : If you don 't know the history of S.H.I.E.L.D. by now , there 's no excuse ... unless you fell asleep in Professor Vaughn 's class ... that 's a perfectly acceptable excuse . [ laughter ] Our instinct as scientists is to move forward , advance quickly , push the envelope . But given recent events , it makes sense to reflect back on our history . Ward : And you can 't think of any reason a top student would want to go after you ? No . Um , the top students are my friends . It 's competitive here , but we usually don 't resort to knocking each other off . This isn 't operations ... no offense . None taken . All these names you would consider friendly ? Well ... not Donnie Gill . I barely know the kid . - He doesn 't talk to anyone . - And he was at the pool . Studying , but I don 't think he 's the guy . He just has trouble communicating with anyone below a 170 I.Q. And S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded after the SSR was able to defeat the nearly indomitable force known as Hydra . We tend to forget that these organizations ... Hydra , Centipede , A.I.M. ... were also made up of extremely brilliant scientists , men and women who started with the same unlimited potential as you or I. Potential can sometimes be dangerous . Plutonium has the potential to power a city ... or to be a nuclear bomb . Simmons : Today , we 'd like to share a few stories from the field in which we learned this lesson up close and faced the consequences when untested technology or biology lands in the wrong hands . And don 't worry ... we brought pictures . [ laughter ] Oh , god . Oh , god ! What is this ? ! Hey , what 's happening to me ? ! Help me ! Help me ! Get it off ! Make it stop ! Help me get it off ! No ! Make it stop ! [ woman screams ] [ woman screams ] Simmons : Find exposed skin . He needs glucose to raise his body 's natural freezing point . Simmons , I need something to break the ice . [ crowd murmuring ] - Jemma . Ready ? - Yeah . Ward : Fitz , talk to me . Something 's doing this to him . Find it . - Ward , there it is . Fitz , what now ? - Smash the damn thing ! [ cracking ] [ groans ] [ breathing heavily ] Fitz : It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's over . [ applause ] Who would do this ? I don 't want to hear excuses why it didn 't work . I have people who do that for me . I just want you to take care of it before I arrive . Just keep in mind how much this will benefit us both , yeah ? Man : Mr. Quinn , plane 's waiting for you , sir . And you can 't think of anyone here who 'd want to hurt you ? I don 't know anyone . Donnie , I 'm gonna have you escorted back to your room . You get some rest and stay warm . Sorry I ruined your lecture . I was really looking forward to it . Simmons : It 's not your fault , Donnie . No genetic materials or prints found on the device . The components are rare and expensive . Freshman pranks are tradition , but these are something else . Attempted murder . So , Donnie was the intended target all along ? He have anything in common with the Cadets at the pool ? - These kids were popular . Donnie was ... - Not . Donnie hadn 't made any enemies here , but he hadn 't made any friends , either . He had a hard time adjusting ? How old is he ? 18 , youngest since you guys . 190 I.Q. and failing out of high school when we met him . - Probably bored out of his mind . - Mhm . If things went well , we were considering graduating him early and assigning him to the Sandbox . Wow . Well , he would love it there . But he doesn 't like it here , so I 'm afraid he 'll wash out . Ward : Maybe that was the idea . Agent Weaver , keep working with investigations ... - interviewing Cadets , instructors . - Of course . - And us ? - Their interviews won 't bear fruit . We teach Cadets to keep secrets . Where did you guys hang out when you wanted to get away from the faculty ? Can we tell someone from operations ? Yes , because we need to conduct our own investigation . [ horns honking ] [ engine shuts off ] Coulson : Dario Marquez 's dress shop . Marquez doesn 't do the best papers in town , but he also doesn 't use a computer . So , if Lumley 's gonna make a run for it , your guess is he might pass through that door . It 's worth a shot , so we wait . - Simmons : And when we get there ? - We mingle , low key . You and Skye get comfortable with the students ... see if you can get them gossiping . Skye looks young enough to blend in . You 're not exactly old man river , and Fitz looks younger than us . Time will come when you won 't make fun of me for that . You 'll be jealous . You 'll be jealous , wrinkly old hags . - I want Fitz to go talk to Donnie . - Sorry ? Donnie 's withdrawn , might know more than he 's letting on . You 're a hero here , Fitz . He looks up to you . Go hang out with him . Even if he has no clue who might be after him , - he could use a friend . - That is a wonderful idea . Ward has them from time to time . I 'll meet you later . - What ? It 's strategic . - It 's adorable . The Tin Man has a heart after all . So , where are we going ? [ both chuckles ] S.H.I.E.L.D. keeps careful watch of everything within their walls , so in the late ' 60s , to escape the cameras and the prying eyes of the faculty , a few Cadets started sneaking down to the boiler room to play cards , you know , exchange ideas . Skye : My kind of people . Some amazing breakthroughs have come out of here . - So the tradition lives on . - Of cramming into the boiler room ? [ indistinct conversations ] Well , over the years , we made a few improvements . [ dance music plays ] Do you have one of these at operations ? - No . - Did not think so . Drinks are on me . - Donnie . - Agent Fitz , sir . Oh , please . Call me " Fitz . " Mind if I come in ? Yeah ... no . I mean , no , I don 't . Okay , my room was just like this , except , um , um , there was a lot more laundry on the floor . [ chuckles ] You feeling better ? You know , you shouldn 't be afraid to tell me if you think someone could be targeting you . I 'm not . It was ... it was probably just a prank . - Freshmen get pranked . - I remember vividly , but that doesn 't mean that every freshman needs to be thawed . Is that a design for organic light-emitting diodes ? - For active camouflage , I 'm thinking . - Hmm . An ionized air cannon ? - It 's so small . - Well , I was able to double the - pressurization by making ... - By making it compact . Clever . I must say ... these ideas are way beyond what I was toying with in my first few months . You shouldn 't keep these big ideas to yourself . You should run them by your instructors . These aren 't my big ideas . So ... say you 're gonna do what this guy did ... leave S.H.I.E.L.D. , go off the grid . What 's your move ? I 'd hide in the wheel well of a 747 flight from Newark to Singapore . Oxygen , a chute . The back half of the trip passes over 3,000 miles of land , a dozen countries ... could drop anywhere . You 'd probably head to South America . - You speak Spanish . - Vacation Spanish . Lima , most likely , what with the growing food scene . - All right , what 's up ? - You tell me . - You 're talking , more than ever . - ' Cause you 're not . And you suddenly became active on the Skye investigation ? She 's proved herself ... stepped up in a big way ... for our team , for you . Is that it , or is it just to distract me ? [ sighs ] Both . I know you 're having a hard time believing what ... They changed my memories . Who 's to say they didn 't change more ? [ sighs ] I say . I know you , Phil , and I knew you before . You 'd know I 'd be the first to go down that road if I thought it led somewhere . Do you believe me , at least ? - Do you ... - Yes . Good . But I 'm tired of secrets , so I 'm glad we 're here . We need to root out all the secrets . Agent Ward and I have been having sex ... I got him . [ car door opens ] [ indistinct conversations ] He 's headed your way . Looks like he 's heading down the alley . Aah ! [ grunting ] [ tires screech ] I 'm Agent Coulson , with S.H.I.E.L.D. Oh , thank god . It 's about the baby girl , isn 't it ? Cyanide ? What did you think we were gonna do to you ? - What they did to her . - Agent Linda Avery ? She wasn 't the first one to die . We were headed into the Hunan province of China . A senior agent had called in an 0-8-4 . An object of unknown origin . We 've dealt with those before . He said the entire village had died trying to protect this one . Avery and I were just fresh out of the Academy . And there was five of us just running the back end , until we lost communication with the first team . We went searching . We found the senior agent under a bridge . He ... he managed to escape with a gunshot wound to the neck , but he bled out . He was still holding on to the 0-8-4 . [ scoffs ] Poor thing was covered in blood . We thought she was dead , too , but sh ... she was just asleep in the dead agent 's arms . Wait ... the baby ? The girl was the 0-8-4 ? If she had powers or something , we never witnessed it . The five of us helicoptered the kid off , headed home . After we landed , we started getting crossed off . - Executed ? - Tortured , heads bashed in . And when it came down to Avery and I , we realized the only way to keep our people and the kid from being hunted ... - Was to erase her from existence . - Avery was smart . She used the lead agent 's credentials to fake a level 8 clearance , she set up a nearly invisible protocol . The foster system was ordered to move the child around every few months . - But they still got to Avery . - She died protecting that secret . - And you left town . - Oh , I left everything . I mean , whoever killed that kid 's family and all those agents was a force to be reckoned with . - And that girl ... - Don 't tell me a damn thing about her . I don 't want to know . You understand ? Just tell me ... is she okay ? - She 's safe . - Then maybe it was all worth it . - You taking me in ? - Yeah . No . I 'm not sure S.H.I.E.L.D. is the safest place for you right now . We 'll get in the air and drop you somewhere along the route . Thank you . Bit of advice ... stop digging and stay the hell away from that girl . 'Cause wherever she goes , death follows . It 's best no one knows about this , for Skye 's safety and for ours . You can never tell her . [ dance music plays ] - Bartender seemed chatty . - He 's in computer sciences . Didn 't take long to convince him I was a level 7 CS operative . And guess where I 'm stationed ... the Sandbox . - Good thinking . - I asked if any of the Cadets had hopes on getting assigned there . Behind me ... the curls . Callie Hannigan ... ambitious , gunned hard for getting assigned to the Sandbox . And apparently , word 's gotten around she just lost the top spot . - She was at the pool . - But didn 't want to go in . Fitz : A battery that carries a terawatt of energy ? - This is amazing . - Would be if it worked . I 'm ... I 'm close . I 've built some quarter scale , and they would work at that size , but the beat increases at a 4-to-1 ratio with scale . And it melts down . Why not use oxygen ... you know , breathe it in from the outside ? Sure , it 's not gonna react as well with the lithium ion , but the cooling effect would surely make up for that discrepancy . - No ? - Holy crap . - I mean , it 's just an idea . - That 's insane . Uh , but you should show it to Agent Weaver before you test it . You have no idea how powerful this thing could be . Of course . Wow . I 'm sorry . That ... that was awesome . It 's true what the other guys say ... you are the smartest person to come through here . Is that what they say ? Yeah ? Well , Simmons is probably smarter , technically , but that 's because she likes homework more than life itself . Nice to have someone to talk shop with all the time ... or to just plain talk to . You know , um , I didn 't like it here at the Academy at first . - You didn 't ? - No . I was shy , a bit of a loner . My Mum did her best at home , but I may as well have been speaking Japanese when I talked electronics ... - So I kept things to myself . - Me , too . The kids in my hometown wouldn 't talk to me . And when S.H.I.E.L.D. told my Dad I was gifted , - He said , " at what ? " - [ chuckles ] Yeah . Well , hang in there . You 'll find a friend here . Actually , I 'm off to meet the team right now at the boiler room ... if you 'd like to join . Uh , maybe later . I 'm gonna try to draw up some of those changes . - Later it is . - And ... thanks . No problem . - Not a bad shot . - You mean for a girl . For anybody . Elastic collision equations , contact point geometry , and practice . So , why is a guy from operations hanging out in the boiler room , anyway ? Looking for the smartest mind you have here to duck out , join my top shadow unit . Is that you ? Could be . Shadow unit doing what ? I 've said too much already , but that tech in the lecture hall ... it was impressive . Whoever built that tech ... I could see them moving to level 6 within the year . Even though Donnie and Seth were hurt ? The boys survived . Yeah , probably the best thing that 's happened to them all year . Why don 't you tell me what you meant by that ? And I 'll not tell Agent Weaver how eager you were to jump rank over at operations . I 'm just saying they got to meet Agent Fitz . [ chuckling ] They 've been talking about it for weeks . Weeks ? We just came here ... - Talking about it to whom ? - Each other . [ whirring ] Jemma , please don 't tell me you 've left the boiler room already . Fitz , they staged the attacks . - Well , that 's nonsense . Why ? - To lure us to the Academy and to take them off our radar as suspects . You need to get out of there . He 's after you . Relax . I 'm out . You 're overreacting . He 's just a lonely kid . We had a nice little hang session . I actually helped him solve his ... power problem . [ sighs ] Oh , no . That 's what you 're trying to power ... a bigger version of the ice machine ? You weren 't supposed to see this . This is very , very dangerous , okay ? You can 't have this here . We have to turn it in to Agent Weaver . You weren 't supposed to see this . We need to go . Come on ! [ sighs ] - How could I have been so stupid ? - Fitz , will you stop ? - I 'm sorry , sir . It 's my fault . - Any word on the missing Cadets ? Ward 's coordinating the search effort with Agent Weaver . They 've set up a perimeter and are going building to building . Where did you guys go ? - We were trying to reach you . - Not now . - How dangerous are they ? - Extremely dangerous . This device turns any moisture around it to ice very rapidly , at a great range . But Donnie 's a good kid ... just felt isolated . Seth must have befriended him to manipulate him , using him to finish the ... the product . Product ? [ sighs ] Okay , I think they have a backer . The device ... the components are incredibly rare and expensive , nothing either of them could find on the open market themselves . If the parts are that rare , we can trace the purchases . Sometimes , it 's not a bad seed , just a bad influence . Let 's go . No , no . No , that 's not the issue . Look , Donnie and I have the device ready to sell , a-and we solved the power problem , but , uh , look , we ... we ... we ran into some trouble . - S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s looking for us now . - Seth , what did I say was the most important aspect of this deal ? That nobody know about it . Right . Well , now the deal 's gonna have to change . Skye : We were worried about bad influences ? - He 's the worst there is . - Ian Quinn . You gotta be kidding . Fitz : Thermopile radiation sensors . Shipped to Seth 's father , who 's a lawyer for Quinn worldwide . Quinn 's buying their technology . Simmons : [ sighs ] What a sleaze . The Cadets have no idea he 's a criminal . - To them , he 's just a venture capitalist . - This is Quinn 's M.O. He finds young talent and he takes advantage , right ? - Hello ? - Contact Ward and Agent Weaver . Have them widen their search to include Ian Quinn . [ sighs ] - Hey , can I talk to you for a second ? - I have to brief May . - Just two seconds ... that 's all . - Yeah . This is an unfortunate situation you 've gotten us into , Seth . Where are you ? We 're ... we 're hiding at a parking garage near the Academy . There 's checkpoints set up all around . - We 're boxed in . - It looks like I 'll be turning around . Sorry we couldn 't do business . No , no , wait ! M-Mr . Quinn , please . Can you send a chopper or something to come and get us ? Look , believe me ... it 's worth it . - Prove it , Seth . - What do you mean ? A demonstration ... I want to see what I 'm paying for in action , right there at S.H.I.E.L.D. - Then you 'll come and get us ? - I wouldn 't be able to resist . [ sighs ] The deal 's a no-go . Let 's turn around , go back to the Seychelles . - You copy that , sir . - Darling , can you freshen this up ? Ready for this , Donnie ? Hey . We 've come this far . - Maybe it 's too far . - [ sighs ] We 're in this together ... you and me against the world , right ? How many times have we said we want a chance to do something incredible ? Well , this is it , and it comes with a ton of money . Come on . Say something . I 'm ... I 'm nervous . The ... the prototypes are harmless , burn out in minutes , but this ? We haven 't run virtual simulations . At this size , with the new power source , it 's not ... it 's not safe . Donnie , you need to grow a pair . Now , you can 't bail on me now . We have one chance to impress Mr. Quinn , and now he 's our only way out . We can 't turn back after what we did back there . What ... what ... what you did . - You knocked Agent Fitz unconscious . - He found us out . And it was your idea to draw him here to fix your damn power source . Our plan has worked so far , Donnie , and so will this . [ whirring ] [ beep ] W-what happened ? I-is it a dud ? I-I don 't ... I don 't ... I don 't know . Ever since you got back from who knows where , you won 't even look at me . And I know things have been heavy right now , but ... did I do something wrong ? No . I did . [ sighs ] Ian Quinn 's not the only one who manipulates people , Skye . We do it all the time ... actually teach it at the Academy . - It 's our trade . - What are you talking about ? I 've been keeping something from you . But recently , I realized I had no right to do that . You lied to me . Agent May and I went down to Mexico City to talk to somebody ... somebody who knows where you came from . - Tell me . - When we started this , I warned you ... - that you might not like what you learn . - And I told you ... that it can 't be worse than what I have imagined . It is . The agent who dropped you at St. Agnes was not your mother , but she was killed trying to protect you . 24 years ago , an entire S.H.I.E.L.D. team in a small village ... was massacred ... in attempt to secure you . [ music ] [ wind rushing ] [ thunder crashing ] I 'll be damned ! We did it ! It worked ! I did it . Seth : The ice stopped . So it 's ending ? Donnie : No . It 's just beginning . We 're in the eye of the storm . A storm ? But crystalline nucleation - should only create ice around the ... - It did ... up there . We seeded the clouds . In the most effective way in history , Seth . [ thunder rumbling ] - We created a superstorm . - He said he wanted a demonstration . - What are you doing ? ! - I have to try to reverse the process . Look , Quinn specifically said he needed a working apparatus to come and pick us up . All the money in the world won 't matter if we 're dead . Please . Please help me . Coulson : How do we stop it ? We can 't stop it . They 're in real trouble . - Where is the device ? - Most likely right there ... dead center of the storm . Coulson : We 've got to get Donnie out of there . Ward , how are things on the ground ? We 've got most everyone safe in the boiler room . Everybody , move back ! Make some space ! How bad is this gonna get ? Bad . Can you reach the North campus parking garage ? We think Donnie Gill and his device may be trapped in the center of the storm . That 's not far from where I am . I can get there . [ wind rushing ] Yeah , I can 't get there . Is there any other way to get to Donnie ? Think fast , people . I know one way . Hold on tight . [ thunder crashing ] [ electricity crackling ] Seth , hold the barium hydroxide chamber in place ! - Okay ! - Hold on ! Okay , that should do it . Now take ... [ electricity crackling ] [ screams ] Aah . Seth ! Seth ? We 're gonna have to try to get underground , ride it out till the storm passes . Hey , Seth . Seth ! Hey , hey , Seth . Seth , can you hear me ? [ wind rushing ] [ whirring ] He 's been hurt ! Please , you need to help him ! Simmons : He 's in cardiac arrest ! Skye , get a blanket for his head ! Lay him down here ! Sir , I need the A.E.D. ! Fitz , oxygen . 0.4 millimeters of epinephrine . Fitz : I got it . [ thunder rumbling ] Get ready to clear . - Charging . - Aah ! Get back ! [ electricity charging ] And clear ! Pulse ? - Nothing . - Charging . [ electricity charging ] Clear . - Pulse ? - Coulson : No . - Charging . - He 's gone . [ breathing heavily ] No , sir . Seth ! Seth ! Come on , no ! No . Don 't go . No . Donnie , I wanted to wish you good luck . And I 'm very sorry . Don 't say you 're sorry . My only friend is dead because of me . - I don 't know what else to say . - Then don 't say anything . May : What will happen to him ? They 're moving him to the Sandbox , but not as a researcher . They want to keep an eye on him . - Did , uh , you hear what I said in Mexico ? - What , specifically ? - A-about Ward and me , um ... - Yeah , I heard . [ scoffs ] I trust you know what you 're doing , - and if it 's a problem ... - I 'll end it . Skye requested a moment alone on campus . - You told her , didn 't you ? - I had to . It must have destroyed her to hear all that . That 's the thing about Skye . What I told her shattered her world . Her lifelong search led to stories of murder , and now it 's too difficult to continue . Her search is over . Her story ends here . - But you know what she said ? - Tell me . She said " no " ... her story started here . Her whole life , she thought she wasn 't wanted , that she didn 't belong , that every family that took her in didn 't want her to stay , didn 't care . But all that time , it was S.H.I.E.L.D. protecting her , looking after her . That 's what she took away from the story ... not the family she 'll never have but the one she 's always had . Here I am , telling her something that could destroy her faith in humanity . And somehow , she manages to repair a little piece of mine . The world is full of evil and lies and pain and death , and you can 't hide from it ... you can only face it . The question is , when you do , how do you respond ? Who do you become ? [ cracking ] Coulson : We 'll return in a moment . [ telephone rings , clicks ] Quinn : Seth , I 've gotta say ... you have exceeded my expectations . Coulson : We 're on to you . Who is this ? Agent Phil Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D. We 've never actually met , but I 'm familiar with your work ... all of it . So , this is a " getting to know you " call ? No , just a message that the first time your aircraft drifts over any country allied with S.H.I.E.L.D. , we will shoot you out of the sky . So this is a courtesy call . Well , thank you , Agent Coulson . And I have a message for you . The Clairvoyant told me to say hello .

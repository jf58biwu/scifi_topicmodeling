 ( Henry ) Sensei ... what is this used for ? ( Nanase ) It 's a study of paranormal abilities in mice . ( Fujiko ) This . RAT , AT , T This ... was my father 's experimental device . My father wasn 't dead . Allow me to introduce myself . I 'm Sakura Shougo . 12 years ago , I worked with your father . Dad ! ( Ruri ) What do you think ? She 's been like that since last night . ( Akira ) Does it have anything to do with the strange food you fed her ? You 're rude . I won 't let you come over here if you say things like that . Nanase , we 're leaving . She isn 't listening . I 'm listening . Hey , Nanase ! I lost 20 kg in one night ! Wow ! That 's great , Ruri ! It 's pointless to talk to her . Let 's go , Akira . It 's pointless to talk to her . Let 's go , Akira . The day after tomorrow , I 'll get to see my father . Episode 07 Reunion and ... ( Nanase ) Am I that scary ? ( Nanase ) Am I that scary ? You can 't understand anything at all . You can 't understand anything at all . You can 't solve anything . No one can save you . ( Takamura ) Stop ! ( Kousuke ) You will die in a landslide . ( Henry ) I  fve got you . Would you like to fall the same way Nishio did ? ( Akira ) It was better when you didn 't know anything , wasn 't it ? Goodbye ... Takamura-san . ( Etou ) Takamura-san ! Are you all right . You were having an awful nightmare . Is that Hida Nanase business still weighing on your mind ? I think it 's time you forgot about it . Lately , you also haven 't been going home , have you ? Here it is . This is the file on yesterday 's robbery . We have a debriefing at 9 : 00 . Yeah . Am I that scary ? Am I that scary ? ( Takamura ) This morning , I had a strange dream about ... Hida Nanase ... Iwabuchi Kousuke ... Kishitani Naoto ... and Hirose Akira . All four of them were chasing me in the dream I was surprised . I ... was afraid of them . For certain there are things happening around Hida Nanase and her friends . There are things which seem to have a connection with them , but I can 't explain it . I don 't have any substantial evidence . After all , I know they aren 't criminals ... and the investigation is closed . My superior says I 'd better back off . But , in here , I can 't shake this feeling no matter what . ( Fujiko ) I understand you well . Since I met Nanase , I , too , have been neglecting my initial research . Since I met Nanase , I , too , have been neglecting my initial research . Since I met Nanase , I , too , have been neglecting my initial research . I feel guilty as I 'm a faculty member . However ... when things about Nanase and the others started affecting me , I couldn 't stop studying them .  gStudying them ?  h I 'm continuing Hida-sensei 's research . On psychic powers ? We call them paranormal abilities . Paranormal abilities , huh ? These aren 't new powers . In fact , in all likelihood , all people possess these abilities . What do you mean ? You feel someone watching you from behind ... so you turn around and then your eyes meet . Have you ever had that experience ? Yes , I have . Is there an explanation for why you felt they were looking at you ? No . Is that a paranormal ability ? Can 't you think of a telephath 's ability to feel other people 's minds directly as an extension of that line ? Can 't you think of a telephath 's ability to feel other people 's minds directly as an extension of that line ? Are you all right ? What 's wrong , Akira ? What about school ? It ended a long time ago . It 's already 3 : 00 . Eh ? This is bad ! I haven 't done anything ! Calm down . I know how you feel . What do you mean ? You talked to your father , didn 't you ? Did you read my mind ? Because you 're completely open . Ah ... It 's great that your father is alive , isn 't it ? Yeah . I want to meet your father , too . I want to ask him various things . But ... I get it . He said he wants you to come alone . I  fm sorry . I am okay , but are you going without telling Kousuke and the others either ? Yeah . Not even Ruri ? I want to tell her , but I will have to tell her about my powers . Will it always be like this ? Eh ? Will we have to keep it secret from our most treasured friends ? They have such a variety of powers ... As far as I know ... To be honest , I still can  ft believe it . I think it 's a natural reaction . Those with powers also know realize that . Thus , they try to hide the powers . However , that 's a form of self-deception . Therefore , it 's torment . Well ... Nanase . Yes ? The day after tomorrow , on our regular off day , do you have plans ? Ah , yes , I do . You do ? In reality ... I was wondering how you felt about getting together with my family for dinner . I 'm sorry . I gave my word . That 's fine . Let 's see . Well ... Nanase , wouldn 't you like to come and live with us , too ? Nanase , wouldn 't you like to come and live with us , too ? Eh ? You can 't freeload off of Ruri indefinitely . If that 's the case , we feel that you and Akira might as well become our children . Boss ... Right ? Excuse me . I 'm Takamura from the Kitashinagawa precinct . Go in the next room for awhile . Eh ? Go quickly . Do as I say . I want to chat with Miss Hida . Can you tell me what it 's about ? No , it 's very ... How long will it take to satisfy your doubts ? There are no doubts . ( Masuda ) I 'm not stupid ! I understand that girl much better than you . I understand that girl much better than you . Listen to me very carefully . Listen to me very carefully . Nanase has lost both parents ! Nevertheless , she 's trying hard to live a positive life ! Nevertheless , she 's trying hard to live a positive life ! Nevertheless , she 's trying hard to live a positive life ! It isn 't possible for her to do anything detestable . I ... Get out ! Don 't ever come in here again . Don 't ever come in here again . But ... I 'll beat you if you keep talking back ! Arrest me if you want ! I won 't allow you to torment that girl anymore ! I won 't allow you to torment that girl anymore ! I won 't allow you to torment that girl anymore ! He shot me down beautifully . That owner ? He always seemed gentle to me . He didn 't even hint of a lie . How do you know ? Because I 'm a detective . I understand liars very well . That is your paranormal ability . You 're exaggerating ... But , it 's very scary to me because you can tell if I 'm lying . But , it 's very scary to me because you can tell if I 'm lying . I really feel this way . Paranormal abilities are within the range of ordinary people . Paranormal abilities are within the range of ordinary people . If I assume Hida Nanase and Iwabuchi Kousuke have supernatural powers , all the issues I have will be explained . But ... I may still be tied down by common sense . I need to see it with my own eyes before I can believe it . If you believe it , will you become their ally ? Yes . From the beginning , I didn 't intend to be their enemy . Although they 're not criminals ... I 'm concerned about them getting involved in cases . I see . What 's wrong ? Just a little headache . Are you all right ? I  fm fine . What do you think of this ? Isn 't this your handwriting ? It 's ... similar . No , I mean , it can 't be anything but my handwriting . You wrote this . What the hell do you mean ? You said you would believe in supernatural powers if you see them in front of your face . This ... is a superpower ? I just came from back from 10 minutes in the future when you wrote this . The boss is also concerned . He used to tell me that in the old days .  gWhenever you 're in trouble , come and talk to me .  h  gFeel free to think of me as if I were your father .  h Kousuke ... There 's something I want to tell you and Fujiko together . You shouldn 't go . Why not ? What will you do if you 're walking into a trap ? A trap ? Think about it . Why didn 't Hida-sensei come to see you ? For certain , he was nearby , right ? Despite this , why didn 't he show his face ? He didn 't want anybody to know that he had come in contact with Nanase Why would he have to do that ? Hida Seiichiro ... is running away from someone . Running away from whom ? Without hesitation , he 'd have come to see you if he 'd been living an honest and decent life . But ... if my father was lying , I 'd understand . Why do you have such doubts about my father ? Is he that unforgiveable ? I can 't let Nanase go alone . Please try to persuade her again . Please try to persuade her again . Be honest with me . What did you see ? Will something bad happen to Nanase ? Did you forget ? You and I might be able to change her fate . Let 's both of us give it a try . But , I don 't know the location ... There 's someone who knows . The one with a previous conviction . Hey Akira . I won 't tell you . Tell me what ? You want to know where Nanase is going , don 't you ? She says she wants to go alone and that 's fine . Akira ... No ! Dad ! Is that true ? Did you read my mind ? Will anything bad happen to her ? Can 't you stop it ? I want to do something ! I want to do something ! Please tell me ! ( Yuriko ) Excuse me . Yes ? I heard that Iwabuchi Kousuke worked here . Yes ... but today Iwabuchi-san is scheduled to come after 8 p.m. He 's appearing at another bar . Is that so ? Then , I 'll come back later . You could leave a message for him . Tell him an old friend dropped by . Old ? He 'll understand if you say  gfrom Hida-sensei 's class .  h This person also knows my father ! Well , until next time ... Give Kousuke my regards . Why the hell did that person come here ? Is there something ? I 'm forbidden to see you at work . The guy who wrote the Tensei Electric article contacted me and says he wants to meet you . The guy who wrote the Tensei Electric article contacted me and says he wants to meet you . I 'm sorry . That 's all right for me now . Will you see Hida Seiichiro ? Will you see Hida Seiichiro ? She 'll see him . I 'm sorry . I get it I will leave you alone for the time being . Er ... can you wait one more day ? Then ... I might be able to discuss it with you . I understand . Excuse me . May I get a ride to the Okuakisawa entrance to mountain trek ? Certainly . Why ? I 'm sorry . We were worried and came ahead of you . On Ogishima , you followed me . Now I 'm reciprocating . Nanase , we won 't intrude . We 'll wait nearby . Please . There 's no reason to run away . I wasn 't running away or anything . I just remembered I left something in school . I see . This child is also worried . Nanase ... and her supernatural friends . Is anything stuck on my face ? Nothing in particular . ( Henry ) Hey ? ! What are you doing here ? I have something to tell Nanase . That 's too bad . Nanase has gone out . Then , what are you up to ? I 'm ... um ... on my way to work . Isn 't this your day off ? It seems like all three of us were thinking the same . Let 's sit down . It 's over there . Are you sure ? Yes . Then we 'll wait here . Thank you . ( Seiichiro ) Nanase . Dad ! It 's been so long ... Now , if I turn my head , at last ... I 'll see my Nanase ! Dad . Nanase . Dad . Dad ! You were told by my boss ... to never show your face to Nanase again . I 'm free to do whatever I want . What about your job ? Is it all right to slack off ? Henry , you lack intensity . What ? Akira ! Look out ! Henry ? Thank you , Henry . Did you just do that ? You saved this child ? I didn 't ... I ... Thank you . Thanks to you , I also survived . Is that so ? Sunador-sensei and Kousuke are here ? They came out of concern for me . They say they don 't have to see you . No ... there 's something I  fd like to tell them , too . Do you want me to summon them ? Before that ... I want to get a good look at you . You have your mother  fs eyes . Really ? When you smile , you 're the splitting image of her . My mother ... was thinking about you the whole time . was thinking about you the whole time . In her mind , she said ,  gI 'm sorry .  h Is that so ... After that ... I ... I was suddenly able to hear other people 's thoughts . I was at a loss as to what to do . Ah ... I kept thinking over and over again that you were still alive . I kept thinking over and over again that you were still alive . I 'm so sorry . Why did you abandon us ? If I could have , I would have stayed with you . But ... it had to be like this in order to protect you . What do you mean ? Would you summon the other two ? I want to tell you all together . I understand . Please wait a moment . I was surprised ... Nansae isn 't here , but you could use your powers . But ... because of that , Takamura found out about my power . It 's all right . It seems like that detective is our ally . Until this point , he was suspicious of us . Until this point , he was suspicious of us . But those feelings have completely vanished . ( Seiichiro ) Tensei Electric 's goal ... was to the use supernatural powers for the company 's profits as soon as possible . However ... there were too many unknown factors to make practical use of it . Putting the powers to practical use without knowing how to control them ... is the same as distributing newly developed medicine without knowing the side effects . is the same as distributing newly developed medicine without knowing the side effects . At that premature stage , the company decided to move towards a secondary application of the powers . Secondary application ? They started gathering people with powers in order to give the company an edge over the competition . That was reckless . The company required all my research and my knowledge for that purpose . I couldn 't obey those orders . And that 's when you faked your suicide . I had to do it . By abandoing us ... I did it to protect you . It was Nanase you wanted to protect , wasn 't it ? Kousuke ... Why don 't you tell the truth ? Only after you discoverd the powers in your daughter ... did you finally understand the suffering of supernatural people . You 're right . I 'm truly sorry my selfishness caused you pain . So ... did you find a way to control the powers ? I 'm sorry ... . I see . I understand . Where are you going ? I 've heard what I wanted to know . I 'll be waiting outside . Hida-sensei . I 'd like to ask you a few things . By all means . You disappeared to stop the company from using your research , yet you left this notebook . Why did you do it ? It 's hope for the future . Hope ... I still don 't know why supernatural powers exist . However , there must be a reason for their existence . That notebook contains a clue to discover what it is . I have that notebook in my possession . Is that so ? You 're the right person . Please let me help you when you resume the research . Thank you . When the time comes ... definitely . It was good talking to you Well , I 'll also wait outside . Dad ? Does my power have any meaning ? Yes . In that case , why did you try to make me forget the power ? Because you were special . Because you were special . Special ? Your powers were outstanding . I had no choice but to conceal your powers until I found out how to control them . And ... in the end , what Kousuke said was true . Eh ? I did it because you 're my only daughter . It was a father 's selfishness . This time , will you listen to a daughter 's selfishness ? I hate ... not living with you . I hate ... not living with you . I want us to live together . I still have many things to do . Can you wait until it 's over ? Until when ? As soon as possible . I promise . Then we can live together . Two people , living normally . You promise ? Can I see you again next week ? I want us to your mother 's grave together . Really ? Mother will be so happy . That 's right . There 's something I 'd like to give you . What ? I made something as a reunion keepsake . Will you accept it ? Thank you . It was good we came . We can see each other again , right ? Please take care . Kousuke , too . I 'll see you again , Dad . It was good seeing you Bye . You 're ... It 's been a long time ... Hida-sensei . Sakura . .. I 'm sorry , I can 't let you escape . You 're completely surrounded . Nanase and the others ? We only need you . Will you come with me ? For what reason ? We want your cooperation . In order to advance the research , we very much need your intellect . I sincerely beg you . I can 't be a part of your business . 12 years ago , one day , we had remarkable results with the experiment on the children . It was just before you disappeared . That day , you discovered something , didn 't you ? The secret to how to increase the paranormal abilities . I have nothing to say to any of you . ( Sakura ) You don 't have any other options . ( Sakura ) You don 't have any other options . Hida-sensei ... No ! Dad ! It 's here ! You will come with me today , even if it means hurting you serious . You will come with me today , even if it means hurting you seriously . Give up . Sakura . What 's wrong ? Ouch ... Nanase ? Nanase ... I 'm sorry . Dad ! I can 't protect you anymore . Don 't use your powers openly . Don 't be around people with powers . Why ? Resume ... living a normal life . Forget everything . What happened ? What happened to Hida-sensei ? Nanase ... I want to hold ... you once more . Dad . Nanase . Dad ? hold you ... once more . Dad ? No ! Dad ! Nanase ! Calm down ! Fujiko ! My father is dying ! We must go back to before I left my father ! But ... my power only goes back 20 minutes . But you 're my only hope , Fujiko . Take me far back ! Please ! I understand . Let 's go back . Fujiko ... what 's wrong ? Nanase ... I 'm sorry . This was the best I could do ... Nanase ? What 's wrong ? Stop ! Please stop now ! Fujiko ? What the hell ... Something happened to Hida-sensei ... Dad ! It can 't be ... You saw it ? Did the future change ? It changed ... But ... Go after Nanase ! Hurry ! Dad ! Nanase ... I 'm sorry . No ! I hate this , Dad ! I can 't protect you anymore . Dad ! You said we 'd live together !

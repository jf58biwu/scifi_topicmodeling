 I don 't mean to alarm you , but I think you may have a mold problem . That sink with the standing water seems especially concerning . Just wait until the Interrogator gets here . He won 't be smiling then . Looking forward to it . You have the intel on you ? They know . They know ? We have three minutes , Agent Shaw . Time to go , agents . - Exit ? - Follow me . I was wondering what you guys had been up to . - Go . - All right . - Um , where are the dogs ? - Don 't be ridiculous . 1x07 - The Hub I bet you 're usually the one holding something like this . Don 't worry . She knows what she 's doing . Whatever you do , don 't breathe . That was a joke . You should , of course , feel comfortable breathing if you need to , just not through your nose . And very minimally through your mouth . Ah . There we are . That 's all the intel you recovered ? Ah . I certainly hope so . Well , thank you , Agent Shaw , for keeping it safe up there . We 'll push this through to the Hub . In fact , we 're headed there now to drop you off . Get you a change of clothes , a proper meal ... you 'll be good as new . The Hub ? Really ? How exciting . It 's been ages . Ah . Good . Done with that paranasal extraction nonsense . - Do you need me to analyze the data ? - That won 't be necessary . If it 's encrypted , I can mine the chip for him . I 'm afraid this mission 's classified . Clearance level 8 . - Uh ... - Ah . Wait . What ? He can just shut us out of the process like that ? Well , he did say the mission is level 8 . And we 're not , so we can 't know about it . Right , but this is normally the part where we all stand around the holocom and we learn about stuff . I mean , aren 't we all on the same team ? No need to get started on one of your socialist riffs . S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s whole infrastructure is based on the hierarchy and compartmentalization of intelligence . Every agent can 't have the intel on every mission . Makes the entire organization vulnerable . Okay , fine , but if I just fought my way out of an underground Siberian prison , I 'd kind of want to know what for . Coulson 's got you used to the plane , the way we do missions here . The Hub is different . The Hub ? What 's the Hub ? Wow . Didn 't realize big brother was this big . Oh , this is nothing . Wait until you see the triskelion . Everyone 's wearing the same suit . Someone tell me why , please . - Do I get one ? - That 's your badge , which means you 've got a long way to go to even make level 1 . Copy that . Does that also mean no access to any computers here whatsoever ? I could run a search on the redacted S.H.I.E.L.D. file on my parents . - Skye . - But it just ... It seems like the place they 'd keep them , right ? I 'll look into it . But right now , we 've got more pressing matters at hand . - Agent Sitwell . - Agent Coulson . Good to see you feeling better . Agent Hand 's waiting for you in the situation room . - And she doesn 't like to wait . - So you know her ? Only her reputation . After you . Your level 7s can join us in the briefing . Say cheese . - Victoria Hand ... - Is here . Ouch . Is this your subtle way of saying I can 't come with ? - We 'll be back . - Wha ... We should probably head over to the tech corridor . - Oh , I can 't wait to see the new chem-kit . - Yeah . I don 't think it likes me here . - Agent Hand . - Agent Coulson . Nice to finally put a face to the name . Likewise . These are Agents May and Ward . Well , now that we 've gotten that over with , here 's what you can know . The intel you recovered from Agent Shaw tells us that a separatist group from South Ossetia has built a weapon called " ezbiitomet . " - The overkill device ? - A little dramatic for my taste . I imagine something was lost in translation . We 've intercepted chatter that tells us they plan to use the weapon in the next 24 hours to declare their independence from Russia and Georgia . We believe it creates sonic vibrations powerful enough to trigger weapons from a great distance ... anything from the missiles on a helicopter to a nuclear warhead sitting in its silo . So if we move on them , they could use our own weapons against us . Exactly . That 's why I need a two-man team to sneak across the disputed border undetected , break into the separatist stronghold , and disable the weapon in the next 24 hours . And you have two people who fit my bill . Not a problem . I was in Georgia during the incursion in ' 08 . I still have contacts on the South Ossetian border . And you 'll have to use them . But we don 't have specs on the device , so I need someone on the team who can identify and dismantle it on-site . - Do you mean ... - I think she does . I found a localized E.M.P. , plus a few other party favors . Oh , come on . What the ... Open . It 's stuck ! The cart 's stuck . That 's unbelievable . What the hell ? ! Who designed this ? ! In the Hub , of all places . Oh , that 's ... Seriously ? I just can 't believe you 're going in dark , in hostile territory , without comms , lacking any real physical strength . - I 'll be fine . - Did I give you an antivenin pack ? The Caucasus have a plethora of highly endemic spider species . Jemma , stop . Stop worrying about me . I can do this . Thank you . And don 't you do anything rash while I 'm gone like jump out of an airplane . - Well , you 'll be careful . - Yeah , I 've handled worse . Oh , I almost forgot ! I made you this . Your favorite sandvich . Prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella . - With your homemade pesto Aioli ? - Just a hint . Hey , is this what you wanted ? Also , what is this ? Oh , Fitz . A full-sized mag pouch ? Just one of the many tactical decisions I 've had to make already . - Hmm . - And Ward said we needed it . You need to disable the overkill device by 0600 tomorrow in order to prevent the separatist attack . Once you signal S.H.I.E.L.D. , the extraction team will get you both out . - Take care of him . - Of course , sir . More moving , less talking , Agent Ward . Time 's not on our side . Does this feel okay to you ? Shouldn 't we be going with him ? The people who put these ops together are the best of the best . The know what they 're doing . So Simmons , by this point , does not have a bloody clue . You know , we 're in the back , trying to contain our laughter . So Simmons goes into the vacuum chamber wearing ... wearing a-a bunny suit . Um , we just call it that because it it covers your whole body . So she 's in the vacuum chamber , but when she takes her mask off to speak to me , she sneezes all over the Faraday cup which is funny . - Do you have the beacon ? - Yeah . But it 's funny because vacuum chambers are so dry , and this instrument was actually supposed to go into space . It had sensitive chemical components . Simmons actually tells it a lot better than I do . Listen . My contact 's Yuri Dubrovsky . We 'll pay him to get us across the border . We go back , but he doesn 't like new people , so keep your mouth shut and your head down . " Rossiya ! " Evening . Two vodkas , straight . One for me . And one for my friend , Yuri . Um , can you ask what beers that they have on tap ? - Yuri is your friend ? - Yeah . Yuri 's dead . You have no friends here . Oh ! No , no , no , no , no , no . Please be careful . Can you imagine what Fitz would do if the night-night gun was broken when he came back ? Surely he 'll be okay out there , right ? Well , Agent May is level 7 . Maybe she can give us an update on their mission . Does that mean that you do know something and you can 't tell us , or that you don 't know anything ? - Which non-expression is this ? - We know what we 're supposed to . When we have more information , we 'll react . All right , clear out . I need to run some diagnostics , then reboot . That means you two . Off . You guys may be okay with being in the dark , but I 'm not into it . I need answers . And I know just the person who has them . - Who ? - Coulson . I 'm obviously talking about Coulson . I 'm going to need three more chalks queued up at the border . - And a fourth standing by in Armenia ? - Great minds . It must be nice to be off that plane . I understand you 're almost through your recovery . The plane has nothing to do with my recovery . I only know what I 've read . Seems Fury has a soft spot for his favorites . - Not everyone gets sent to Tahiti . - It 's a magical ... place . All I meant was it must feel good to be back in the big leagues . Two of my agents are the key to this operation . I never left the bigs . Let 's hope they 're as good as you think they are . What 's happening ? Why haven 't they killed us yet ? I mean , I 'm glad that they haven 't killed us yet . They 're waiting for their boss , so before he gets here , we need a plan . How long can you hold your breath underwater ? I don 't know . You familiar with the term " slam and cram " ? No , and I d ... I don 't think I want to be . How attached are you to your pinky ? Very , very attached , and before you ask another terrifyingly vague question , let me be clear . - Any plan that involves - Sss ! even one of those scenarios isn 't going to work for me . As a matter of fact , I 've ... I heard you were looking for your friend Yuri . And Yuri was friends with separatists . Are you separatists ? - No . We 're here to stop them . - Definitely here to stop them . Trust me . If you could just help us get across the border ... Ah , I 'm missing the game ! You 're wasting my time , so let me be clear . You 've given me no reason to trust you . And trust is everything to me . - Hey . Fancy seeing you here . - Skye , I told you I 'd look into the file about your parents . No , I know . That 's not why I 'm here . I wanted to know more about Ward and Fitz 's mission . Simmons is seriously starting to unravel without Fitz . I know it 's hard to hear , but you don 't have the clearance . But I have eyes . I saw six squads in full tactical gear , three crates of RPGs , and a full crew of analysts heading ' to operations . Are you really telling me that has nothing to do with ward and Fitz 's mission ? If I 'm right , give me a signal by not saying anything . Trust the system . - How did it go ? - Nothing . He 's acting like a robot version of himself right now . If we want the truth , we 've got to get it ourselves . Okay . How would you suggest ... Oh , wait . No . No ! - Yes . - No ! I can 't be a part of your bad-girl shenanigans . I like following the rules and doing what 's expected of me . - It makes me feel nice . - Simmons , wake up ! Ward and Fitz went on a top-secret , two-man operation , and look . There are more men . And either it 's a bigger deal and they 're not telling us , or something went wrong out there . And maybe there 's nothing we can to do help , but we got to know if there is . What if they 're injured or being tortured somewhere right now ? Fitz . Tortured . What exactly do you have in mind ? Okay ! Enough ! Okay . A little to the left , Vladimir . Gentle ! Gentle . That 's it . Okay . Can I get a little more light down here , Marta ? Of course , Mishka . Thank you , sweetheart . Little bear ? I like watching him work , that little bear . Okay . Ho-ho-ho ! It 's nothing . Really . - I 'm just a man . - Get this man a drink . Oh , no . Here we go . Mmm . Salty . So ... let 's talk business . Two million rubles ? We need to work on your negotiation skills . I thought they were like pesos . And anyway , you should be thanking me . I shorted the circuit breaker with my localized E.M.P. when we were tied up . - Really ? - Yes , and my plan worked because we 're over the border now , aren 't we ? We 're stopping . Why are we stopping ? Quiet . Stay here . I 'll check it out . Okay . Maybe we 'll both stay here . Fitz ! More border patrol . Already moving ! Hurry up ! Sorry . Am I disturbing you ? You know , I like this plane . I like the way we do things here . Everyone 's on the same page , no red tape . So far , it 's working for us . Most of us . And maybe I 'm getting soft , but I don 't like keeping things from our team . If you knew ... No . You 're right . Level 8 . But ... I know . Trust the system . May ? Thanks . Say cheese . Okay , you have the flash drive . I programmed it with a decoy crawler . It 'll use my browser history to simulate my usual online activity , so while S.H.I.E.L.D. thinks I 'm trolling reddit and facebook with the laptop you gave me ... You 'll be hacking the files for Ward and Fitz 's mission . Right . And remember , once you plug it in , you 'll only have about ... Three minutes before S.H.I.E.L.D. catches on . Do you realize that you keep finishing my sent ... Your sentences . I know . I 'm sorry . Bad habit . This is actually a bit thrilling . Ah , good . I 'm glad . Now we 've just got to figure out a way to get the panel open . Don 't worry . I made a special something . It 's what we do . All done . Really ? Wow . Okay . Uh , now just find a USB port . - Okay . - Agent Simmons ? It 's fine . Just play it cool . Hello , Mr. Agent Sitwell , sir . May I help you ? Drainage pipe . We 'll wait them out over there . We can 't wait too long . If they use the overkill device , everyone on the border 's in danger . - I 'm aware . - And that includes Marta and Vlad . Oh , you 're on a first-name basis now ? Yeah , well , I 'm just saying , their lives are on the line , too , so let 's not get too comfortable . - Call me Jasper . - Um , what brings you to this restricted hallway so late at night ? - I could ask you the same thing . - No . Don 't . Simmons , focus . Just make up an excuse . I was just on my way to the loo . I could swear it was two rights and a left , but is that it here ? That 's a wall panel . Why are you accessing it ? Don 't spiral . Just say something . Anything . You certainly have a gorgeous head , don 't you ? What ? ! I like men that are about my height , but heavier than me . Stop talking . Stop . Agent Simmons , do you have authorization to access that panel ? Say yes . Say you do . Oh ! Y ... of course . - Great . Yeah . - Of course . Um , I certainly have it right here in my bag . He 's onto me . Stop talking to me ! He can hear you ! Are you on comms with someone ? This is Agent Sitwell . I need an escort . I 'm sorry ! Oh , my god . Oh , my god . Alright . Okay . Okay . Oof . I 've shot agent Sitwell . Good , good , good . - Was that all right ? - That was terrible ! You are terrible at this . That was a total meltdown . The night-night gun was right there , and I ... We need help . You need to go get May . - May ? ! No ! - Listen . That flash drive will only give me a few minutes of access to the Hub 's mainframe to find out what happened to our boys so just go get , okay ? Just tell her it was an accident . I 'm going to be court-martialed . I hope this works . Why do you think S.H.I.E.L.D. sent in just the two of us ? I don 't know . They said they needed a guy like you and a guy like me . - Mmm . - Is that a sandwich ? Simmons made it . My favorite . Prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella with a hint of pesto Aioli . Here . You can have half . What the hell ? There are dogs tracking us , and you bring a prosciutto sandwich . - I can 't believe you just did that . - This is a mission , not a picnic ! Oh , I 'm well aware it 's not " a picnic " , Mr. Save the Day . - What 's that supposed to mean ? - Oh , come on . You obviously get off on it , being the guy who always gets to throw the last punch , who always swoops in to save the girl . And now you 've destroyed the world 's most dangerous sandwich . Congratulations . Well , I 'll tell you something . I don 't need to be rescued by anyone , Grant Ward . Yeah . Oh , and listen . Before we left , Coulson told me to take care of you . That is what I am doing . Nothing more , nothing less . Here . If you 're hungry , eat this . It 's odorless . All right , boys . Let 's find out where you really are . " Redacted documents . " 0 , 4 , 26 , 89 . Okay . There it is ... if I could just access the raw file . Oh , crap . I don 't have any time . Oh , my god . No extraction ? - What did I tell you ? - You told me to trust the system . And the system sent Ward and Fitz in there to die . Good day to be a rat . I mean , there you are , minding your own business , spreading filth and disease , scavenging for grub worms or rotten fruit , When lo and behold , you see it ... a prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella sandwich ... - Fitz . - ... with just a hint of pesto Aioli . Quiet . Feel that ? A truck . It 's coming . Zip up the mag pouch ! I told you I 'd get answers about your family . That 's not what I was looking for ! I was trying to find out what was happening with Ward and Fitz . - That 's a classified operation . - It 's a suicide mission ! I saw it all ... the troop placements , the aerial assault . Once Ward and Fitz disable that device , there 's going to be a huge attack on that compound , with no extraction plan , and you hid that from us ! I didn 't hide anything from you . You don 't have the clearance to know that . Is that really what S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s all about ? Level 5s are more expendable than level 8 ? Is that all we are , just a number to you ? - Are you done ? - I don 't know . Am I ? If S.H.I.E.L.D. keeps a secret from you , it 's for a good reason . - So they can hold all the secrets . - Don 't interrupt ! You just hacked a level-8 secure server , saw operational plans that you have no context for . If details get out , the whole operation could be compromised , lives could be lost , Ward and Fitz among them . I know . Those are two people we care about . On the plane , you 're always telling me to think outside the box , so I went off book ' cause I was trying to watch their backs . Our team can go off book because there is a book . A Hub . An organization watching our backs . You claim that you want to be a part of that , a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent . Do you ? - Yes . - Because someday , I may have to trust you with a secret , and I need to know that you can keep it . Can I ask you one question ? What ? Did you know there was no extraction plan for Ward and Fitz ? That 's classified . Okay . Go . Go . Go . Shh , shh , shh . Go , go , go . - I 'll signal extraction . - Okay . Simmons calls it " the magic window . " You 'd probably guess , " is that X-ray technology ? " There are actually s-band microwave antennae embedded in this sheet . But it 's more like a radar system really . Okay . Let 's see . Okay . Okay , we have two guards on the West wall . Both carrying automatic weapons . Correction . Make that three guards . We have three guards now . Oh , my god . Oh , my god , Ward . He 's attacking the others ! He 's coming straight for us . Ward . - Ward ? ! - Hurry . Inside . Ah . That makes sense now . This must be it . Weird . Core must be inside here . That 's what 's important . The piping around it just serves to amplify and direct the sound , to trigger munitions from a distance . Doesn 't look like it could take a jet out of the sky . Well , you should know by now , Agent Ward , that looks can be deceiving . Yeah . This is gonna take a while . You have 10 minutes . I thought you 'd say five . Agent Sitwell is in the infirmary . Apparently , a member of your team rendered him unconscious . A misunderstanding . I 'll handle the matter internally . Tranquilizing an agent does not qualify as a misunderstanding . You 're right . But being told there 's an extraction team in place when , in fact , there isn 't , that does . I 'm level 8 . I 'm entitled to information regarding the welfare of my team . - You should have told me . - Seemed I didn 't have to . And what would that have changed , Agent Coulson ? You yourself have designed dozens of operations like this . - You know how this works . - Usually with an extraction plan . Barton , Romanoff ... they never have an extraction plan . They know that going in ! Agent Fitz is unproven in the field , and knowing would have caused him - to lose focus or courage . - That should have been my call . I wasn 't sure you 'd comply . Your team includes an electronically tagged non-agent who is notorious for leaking secrets , which reminds me ... How did you get this information again ? I know what the safety of a thousand men is worth . I know the importance of taking the overkill device out of play . But I also know my men ... and what they 're worth ! The decision to go in should have been theirs to make . Perhaps . But you need to trust the system , Agent Coulson . All right . Show me the final steps to disable this thing . I 'll get it done . No , we stick to the extraction plan . I 'll be done in a minute . - The extraction plan 's a bust . - What ? Exfil team didn 't make contact . Once you take that thing apart and I set off the remote beacon , we 're on our own . You should go . I 'm not leaving . - Fitz , there 's no time to argue . - You don 't think I can 't handle this ? - No , I am trying to protect ... - Ah , you think I 'm a coward . Is that it ? What ? No . I am every bit the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent that you are . Whoa . You don 't have anything to prove . What you said about me always needing to swoop in ... I know you would have jumped out of the plane to save Simmons , and she knows that , too . I 'm not trying to prove anything to anyone . Okay ? Before we left , you 're not the only one that Coulson talked to , okay ? He told me to take care of you , too . And that 's exactly what I 'm gonna do . I 'm not going anywhere . You understand ? And I 'm bloody starving . You got the information . Now we react . - We 're gonna get our guys . - Somebody has to . - What about the S.H.I.E.L.D. assault ? - We won 't interfere . You don 't need a battalion for an extraction . Three can pull it off . Four 's better . You 're in ? I thought we all had to be level 8 to discuss this . We 're not discussing anything . Ah-ah . Last chance , Fitz . Are you sure you don 't want a head start ? Because the second you pull that final wire ... Your turn . Beacon 's hot . The device is disabled . Mission 's a go . Okay Fitz . Let 's go . We need to slip out of here before they notice the device is powered down . Got it . We need a new plan . - Are you sure this is gonna work ? - Yes . Theoretically . Okay . Finished . What was that ? S.H.I.E.L.D. They 've started their attack , which means we don 't have much time before they crush the compound . Get up there and take out as many of their weapons as you can with that thing . Fitz ! Behind you ! - I just did that . - Yeah . Okay . Let 's go . You said they needed a guy like me and a guy like you , right ? Right . It 's the extraction team ! Better . It 's the cavalry . Never get tired of seeing that . - Are Coulson 's people clear ? - They are . I thought there wasn 't gonna be an extraction . All our resources were needed elsewhere . And it 's Agent Coulson 's team . They didn 't need one . Okay . Let 's mop up . - Thanks for coming to get us , sir . - We take care of our own . Well done , Fitz . - So glad you 're all right . - Yep . Good to see you , too . Oh ! The sandwich ... how was it ? Too much Aioli ? It was delicious . You know , for a second there , I thought I 'd have to find a new supervising officer . Sorry to disappoint . Truth is , I was in good hands . I had Ward 's back the whole time . Yeah . Pretty much saved him from a gang of Russian mobsters and kicked a few guys ' heads in . But enough mission talk already . - Um , anything exciting happen at the Hub ? - I shot a superior officer in the chest . Hey . I was thinking about today , and I 'm really sorry ... I just wanted to let you know that I didn 't forget about what you asked me back at the Hub . Uh , what do you mean ? The un-redacted file about your past . I found it . Oh . Uh , w-what did it say ? The document wasn 't about you directly . It was about the person who dropped you off at the orphanage . Turns out , it was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent . A S.H.I.E.L.D. agent ? Why ? I mean , who ? What does that mean ? I ... The agent was unidentified . We don 't know if she was your mother or if she just found you on a doorstep . Mother ? It was a woman ? I put in a request to dig further into the files for any related materials , but right now , that 's all I have . I 'm sorry . Sorry ? Thank you . Thank you so much . - You finish reading it yet ? - Mm . What did you tell her ? The truth . I told her a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent dropped her off at the orphanage . - But you didn 't tell her why . - I can 't . Some secrets are meant to stay secret . Will you help me find out what really happened ? Dangerous waters . - But I can try . - Thank you . Poor girl . " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. will return in a moment ... Company . Yes , I need access to a restricted file . Bravo Charlie Yankee 307604 . Authorization code ? X-ray 2896 . You 're looking for a death and recovery report , sir ? Yes , for a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent . Mostly interested in his recovery . It took place in Tahiti . I 'm sorry , but you don 't have access to that document , sir . There must be some mistake . I 'm level 8 . I have clearance for that file . The system indicates that you don 't . Would you like me to submit a formal request to Director Fury , sir ? No . Thank you .

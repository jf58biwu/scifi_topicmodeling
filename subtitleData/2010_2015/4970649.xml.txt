 What 's the plan ? Tough call , chief . My gut tells me Tacos . Make that a grande combo platter . Oh , the food of my people . Roger that . All clear ? Crystal . Don 't answer it ! Pancho 's fiesta palace closes at midnight . I 'll handle it . Six , I know what you 're thinking , but we 're not sneaking out . I 'm trying to ... Rediscover my cultural heritage . Rex ? - It 's me . - Circe ? What do you want ? Things in Abysus they 're bad , Rex . I need your help . Uh , yeah , wow . How do I put this nicely ? Not a chance ! You made your choice , Circe . I made mine . - End of story . - Please , Rex . I know you 're mad at me , but this is a matter of life and death . Hey , hey , a lot of things are these days . Nice talking to you . Rex ? Not getting my combo platter , am I ? Change of plans . Oh , women . ♪ So make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way we 're gonna have fun tonight ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ ♪ so make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ my gear doesn 't have enough range to reach Abysus . Well , that 's easy . Just hot-wire a shuttle . I like your thinking . You ever done this before ? How hard could it be ? All I 've got to do is unleash a few zillion nanites and let them unscramble the ignition lock sequence . Excellent plan . Except maintenance removed the control core for servicing . It was his idea . Care to tell me what 's going on ? Not really . No . Fine . I got a call from Circe . Something 's wrong in Abysus . I just wanted to fly over and take a look . And you didn 't tell me ... Why ? Uh , ' cause you would have used words like " unauthorized " and " no . " I 'm gonna find a way there whether you want me to or not . Doesn 't leave me a lot of choices , does it ? Meet back here in one hour . One whole hour . Taco run numero dos ? Absolutamente . You told Holiday ? Nice to see you too , Rex . I consulted with Dr. Holiday because I wanted to see if your friend 's story checked out . Satellite scans of Abysus show that there is some kind of anomaly . I 'm not sure what it is or what 's causing it , but if you want to help Circe , you 're going to need me there to find out . Hold up . Still waiting for Bobo . I gave him another assignment . Doing what ? What he does best . Stinking up a room ? No . Causing a distraction . White knight would never authorize a mission like this , so we 'll need to travel off the grid . I ditched our communications gear , but our trackers required a much more ... Shall we say ... Elaborate diversion . Pulling one over on the knight . I 'm impressed , six . I didn 't know you were still in touch with Circe . Yeah , me neither . Can we not make a big deal out of this ? We 're here . Something 's definitely affecting the terrain . I 'll put us down near Van Kleiss ' old castle . Considering all the fun I had the first time I came here ... Can 't say I 'm glad to be back . At least we won 't have van Kleiss himself to greet us . Maybe you should call your girlfriend . Already on it . And she 's not my girlfriend . No answer . Reminds me of something I coughed up when I had the flu . I 've never seen anything like this before . These are nanites . Highly unstable . And multiplying . Holiday ! Don 't move ! Now , that 's a face only a chain saw could love . Yeah . Six . Rex . It 's a trap . Are they actually ... helping us ? Rex , no . Don 't cure it . Its nanites could be corrupt , like the ones we found earlier . There 's no telling what they could do to you . Doc , seriously ... You worry too much . Uh , never mind . The same thing 's happening all over Abysus . Uh , a little heads-up would have been nice . I tried . You hung up . Whatever . Do you have any idea what 's causing this ? Well , it started when no . We don 't . But it 's spreading , isn 't it ? Yeah , fast . There 's nothing stopping it from going beyond the border . We 're talking about a global threat here . - How do we stop it ? - We can 't . That 's why I called Rex . You better come with us . - She 's very pretty . - She works for Van Kleiss . She 's the enemy . But you still like her , don 't you ? I 'm not talking about this . What ... is that thing ? Our master left these instructions in case something happened to him . - Then why do you need me ? - It won 't turn on . Did you try a repairguy ? You 're the key , Rex . According to this , your abilities are the only way to get the device running . Figures . He probably assumed I 'd be one of them by now . We can 't do this without you . Please . Rex , Holiday we need to talk . - I don 't trust them . - Yeah . That makes two of us . I 'm not nuts about helping them either , but we 've got to put aside our emotions . If these unstable nanites are allowed to advance , they could consume everything in their path . Nobody will be safe . Think about it . Okay . This thing better not turn me into a French fry . Rex ... Thank you . I 'm not doing this for you . But ... You 're welcome . So ... What exactly am I supposed to do ? When I said you were the key , I meant that literally . According to the plans , the machine needs to be turned on from a nanoscopic level . Uh , how do I do that ? This isn 't exactly telling a vending machine to cough up a soda . Try . Okay . Here goes nothing . Van Kleiss ! Rex ! No ! Master ! You lied to me ! You wouldn 't have come if I told you the truth . This wasn 't about you needing me . This was about you needing Van Kleiss ! I need you both . Please , Rex , you don 't understand . No ! You don 't understand ! Van Kleiss is gone , and I intend to keep it that way ! You 've destroyed us all ! Don 't even breathe . You don 't know what you 've done . Then I guess we 're even . You 've never understood his power . Van Kleiss kept us safe here . His force was the only thing holding Abysus together . - And you destroyed that . - We 're done here ! Rex , I think she 's right . Nanites operate on a molecular level . If they bonded with Van Kleiss , breaking off his connection could have corrupted their internal structure , leading to a disastrous chain reaction . So what are you saying ? I couldn 't save Van Kleiss , and now the world 's gonna end ? This is my fault ? This isn 't about blame , Rex . If Van Kleiss ' system can actually withstand these unstable nanites , he could be the only one who can rein them in for good . I 'm not bringing him back ! Not now , not ever ! Besides , you don 't need Van Kleiss . You have me . Why not go straight to the source ? Rex , no ! Stand down ! It 's too dangerous ! Rex ! Stop ! Let go of me ! If you keep fighting these nanites , they 're going to kill you . And if I don 't , they 'll kill everybody else . Not if you listen to me . It 's a long shot , but I 've got another idea . Instead of trying to deactivate the nanites , communicate with them . You want him to talk to the nanites ? He 's done it before . Never anything this big . It 's the same basic principle . Interface with the unstable nanites , gain control over their programming , and tell them to stop advancing . Hey , why not ? If this works , we should see results immediately . The nanites are responding . Rex , you can stop now . You did it . Yeah . I 'm awesome . I thought you said the nanites stopped spreading ! They did , but now they 're contracting . Bet you didn 't plan on that , did you , doc ? Everybody out ! Now ! I got you ! Don 't let go ! Circe ! Circe ! Six ! Dr. Holiday ! Okay ! You win ! Something 's not right . Van Kleiss , I need you to focus . The whole place is being eaten up by this weird goop . Some kind of nanite I know what this is ! What are you stopping for ? Finish the job ! And what will you do for me in return ? Are you kidding me ? ! I brought you back ! What more do you want ? You know exactly what I want . It 's simple , really . Join us , and everyone you care about lives . Refuse , and they die . Fine ! Now help them ! Circe ! Come on ! Breathe ! Hey . Hey . What a touching little reunion . Van Kleiss ? In the flesh . And actually feeling better than ever , especially now that Rex has finally come to his senses . Isn 't that right , Rex ? Better than ever . - A deal 's a deal . - What deal ? What 's he talking about ? It was the only way to save you . Welcome home . Rex ! Don 't do it ! We 'll find another way . I admire your integrity , Rex . Now I 'd say we are even . That 's it ! You said you feel better than ever ? That 's because something 's changed inside you . Your nanites are different now . Should that matter ? Oh , yeah . Rex ! What are you doing ? ! What does it look like ? I 'm curing him . That ought to do it . Master , you 're ... Human ? You 're welcome . This ... is impossible . I was uncureable ! That 's right ... Was . I noticed something strange when I plugged in to that machine of yours . You were coming back , but as " Van Kleiss light . " But , hey , the good news is , now there 's nothing stopping us from hauling your sorry butt to jail . Except us . Master , go ! Come on , Van Kleiss . This is just sad . Taking advantage of me in a moment of weakness is no triumph , Rex . You may have temporarily relieved me of my powers , but my greatest strength is still untouched . Uh , what 's that ? Your hair ? My intellect . Maybe they 'll let you do crosswords in your cell . Perhaps another time . Oh , great . Breach is back . And the pack is gone . Awesome . - So , how come you 're still here ? - You saved my life . Would have been rude to leave without saying thanks . Eh , that 's true . 'Course , you don 't have to leave . Uh , come on . Maybe we should , uh ... Start our mission debriefing ? Stay with us , Circe . Van Kleiss is done . As much as I care about you , Rex , Van Kleiss and the pack are my family . They took me in when nobody else would . - I can 't abandon them . - So that 's it . We 're always going to be on opposite sides , then . It does keep it interesting . You okay ? No offense , doc , but I totally do not get women . One day , you will . I still don 't have a clue .

 Come in . Anyone ? Anybody out there ? We 're sick . I 'm broadcasting in the blind . Mama ? Mama ? - Mama ? - In the blind ! Mama , please don 't fall asleep . Mama , we 're gonna get you help . Wake up , mama , please ! Anyone , please ? Anyone out there ? Anyone ... damn it ! Mama , please don 't fall asleep ! Wake up , mama ! Mama ! What 's your name ? You sure you have enough for the whole crew ? And 50 or 60 more . When we get home , we can use this as a vaccine and a cure ? The uninfected will be immunized , and ... the sick can be cured , Providing they 're not too far gone . After all the failures and the false starts , I just feel so ... Happy ? I can 't truly remember the last time that I felt that emotion . Still so much to do . We have to mass produce it , we have to distribute it . - Thank God ... - Rachel ... You did it . Let 's enjoy the moment . I told her how I feel . I mean ... basically spilled my guts to her . I mean , sure , I 'm spiking a 104-degree fever , But still . " You make me wanna love again . " I actually said that . And what does she give me ? Zip . What I understand about women , you fit in a shot glass . I don 't need to tell you . Hey , how are you feeling ? I don 't get seasick , so ... I 've never seen morning sickness on a D.D.G. before . Have you seen a nursery ? No . Form up . Okay , here 's the deal . We are presently attempting to make contact with the infectious disease lab at Fort Detrick , As it has just the facility Dr. Scott requires for mass producing the cure . So far we 've had no joy . I 'll be honest ... knowing how deadly this plague is and how fast it spreads , I don 't have any confidence that there 's gonna be any survivors , so ... That being said , there 's a reason they call it a fort . And if anyone can hold their own , it 's our friends in the U.S. Army . Master chief . Thank you , sir . I want to address the issue that 's on all of our minds . On our way up the coast , our ship will be passing right by Norfolk ... by home . And our comms team tells us we could pick up some orphan signals from random cell towers or servers still online . You may even get a phone call if they 've restored power on land . It 's unlikely , but I just wanna prepare you . We don 't know what to expect when we get back to the states . The only way to help the people we love is to deliver Dr. Scott and the cure to a secure and workable lab . Detrick 's our best bet , so that 's our mission . Aye , sir . Carry on . Any station in this net vicinity of Fort Detrick U.S.A.M.R.I.I.D. , this is U.S.S. Nathan James , over . Aye , sir . Captain , S.S.E.S. reports that the keyhole satellite will be flying over our whiskey in 50 seconds . Unable to steer , but they did manage to break the uplink / downlink encryption . Bringing up the feed now . - It 's traveling fast . - Too fast , sir . There 's no one left at home to control it . When it gets over the area , we 'll have less than a minute to capture the images we can . We just need enough to chart a clear route from the land to the lab . We 've tapped into one of the air force 's spy satellites to check the traffic to Fort Detrick . Well , why not send your helicopter or drone ? No more fuel . They spent it all looking for me . Satellite passing over us . Come on , give us something . There it is . Home . That 's interstate 70 . If it 's clear , it 'll get us all the way to Detrick . There 'll be some image blur , but I 'll get you closer , sir . That 's a mass evacuation . - Take us north a mile . - Aye , sir . Any station this net vicinity of Fort Detrick U.S.A.M.R.I.I.D. , This is U.S.S. Nathan james ... That red " X " ... some sort of quarantine ? More like a warning sign to stay away . Looks like people took it seriously . Sir , the satellite 's approaching Dort Detrick . I say again , anyone at Fort Detrick , please respond . The laboratory building 's in the center of campus . Roger that , ma 'am . Zooming in . Oh , my God . It 's been completely destroyed . The lab , the containment areas , the equipment , everything . Nothing else on the base was burned . That lab was targeted . Who would 've done that ? Slow down ! Slow down ! Stop the car . Where you goin ' ? My family 's sick . They need help . Can 't go this way . Turn around . Please . Please , we 're just trying ... - trying to get to olympia . - Olympia can 't help you . Go back where you came from , old man . Get down . Should we go after ' em ? No . They 'll be dead soon . Sir ! Sir ! Take a breath . What is it ? I caught a new broadcast . It 's another loop . But this one was updated today . And there 's something you need to hear . Winds are coming out of the southwest , and temperatures will reach 50 degrees in Baltimore ... How come we 're just hearing this now ? Probably a weak F.M. Transmitter , sir . It must 've just come into range . There are reports of a fresh outbreak of the red flu in sector 9 . - " Red flu . " Is that what they 're calling it ? Doesn 't do it justice somehow . It 's looping around . Here it comes . U.S.S. Nathan James , we are aware of your mission and we have secured the facility you may require . If you are within range of this signal , we urge you to reply over channel 1-6 . I repeat , U.S.S. Nathan james , if you are still out there , please reply on V.H.F. channel 1-6 . - Get them on the line . - Yes , sir . Attention , attention . This is U.S. Naval warship Nathan James hailing you on channel 1-6 . We have heard your call , over . This is U.S. Naval warship Nathan James hailing you on channel 1-6 . We have heard your call , over . Baltimore . We should set a course in that direction . - Agreed . We may still be too far out . You let me know as soon as you find out . Good work , son . Schools have reopened in sector 3 , and some city services are set to resume . Attention , attention , This call goes out to the crew of the U.S.S. Nathan James . We are aware of your mission and we have secured the facility you may require . If you are in range of the signal , We urge you to reply over channel 1-6 . I repeat ... U.S.S. Nathan James , - if you are still out there ... - Jed ? Did you hear that , Darien ? Tom 's still out there . People are waiting for him . Don 't worry , sweetheart . You 're gonna make it . You hang in there . I had to do what was best ... - Best for whom ? - Please listen to that . Ava ? They 're at it again . You know that I love you . Events ... they just happen on a mind of their own ... I know that things are better now . But ... I don 't think they 'll be the same again . Hello , Kelly . Hi . Ava , darling , shall we go and find something to eat ? All right . I 'll see you later . I 'll see you later . Bye . She can 't forgive me for what I put them through . To be honest , I don 't blame her . Well , when the Captain finds the right place for us to put ashore , maybe you can all start again on more solid ground . Captain , I 've got baltimore . A Mrs. Granderson is on the line . Did you say Granderson ? - Yes , sir . - Well , put her through . They 're trying to use the vidcom , but so far it can only get audio , sir . - Go ahead , sir . - This is Tom Chandler , Commanding Officer of the U.S.S. Nathan James , over . Captain Chandler . You have no idea how good it is to hear your voice . We thought you were lost at sea . No , ma 'am , we 're alive and well . - Oh ! There you are . - I got it . You must be nearby . I 'm Amy Granderson . And I suppose an explanation is in order . As vice-chair of the President 's Defense Policy Board , I was briefed on your mission to the Arctic . I knew the risks of the coming pandemic , and I had my daughter transferred to your ship . You must forgive me . No apology needed , ma 'am . Your daughter 's been an incredible asset . Pleased to hear from you . We had no word from the presidential bunker . President Geller invited me underground . I declined . I-I felt the risk was too big to have so much of our civilian and military command in one confined space . Unfortunately , I was right . So the government is gone . For the most part , yes . Since the bunker went silent , there has been a breakdown of infrastructure , general panic , and , of course , a tremendous loss of life . I have tried to execute a contingency plan working with the state and local police to create safe zones . We have been hanging on as best we can . And I have been praying every day for your return . Ma 'am , we can be in Baltimore in the matter of hours . In the meantime , I 'm sure there is someone you 'd like to speak with . Mom ? Alisha ! Mom , I don 't ... I don 't understand ... What are you doing ? Where are you ? I 'm here , darling . Oh , I knew you were out there . I just knew it . Thorwald . We 've intercepted a transmission . A U.S. Navy ship is due to make port in a matter of hours in Baltimore harbor . - What kind of ship ? - I don 't know , sir . Well , is it a tug ? A destroyer ? A 5,000-sailor aircraft carrier ? The signal was spotty . All we know is the name . Nathan James . It 's the ship they 've been hailing for weeks . Granderson 's sending out a greeting party . Well , if they 're having a party ... then let 's party . We are cleared , Baltimore . ... the port distance 1,000 yards . No threats , no contact . All commands reporting ... V.B.S.S. on the way to designated meeting point . E.W. reports negative rackets of interest . Nothing moving on surface plot . Clean picture . Bridge ? C.I.C. A.T.T.W.O. reports S.C.A.T. team manned and ready at all crew-served weapon stations port and starboard . All right , let 's move . - Fan out . - Aye , sir . Secure a perimeter . Dennis and Rowler , left flank . Cruz , you take right . Keep your hands on the swivel , fellas . Perimeter secure . Keep eyes on upper structures . Copy . Here they come . I 'm Lieutenant Pete Norris of the Maryland state police . Inside my vehicles are my assistant Barrack commander , my criminal section supervisor , and a few surviving state troopers . You don 't need the masks . We 're not sick . I 'm Lieutenant Green , this is Lieutenant Burk . It 's a pleasure to make your acquaintance , Lieutenant . Bridge , Burk . The pier is secure . All clear , over . Understand . All clear on the beach . Landing party underway . - Welcome to Baltimore . - Hey , it 's great to be here . Looks like the troopers just got themselves a couple hundred U.S. sailors . A few dozen Tomahawks , too . Looks like a landing party arriving . Including the captain . You must be Lieutenant Norris . Tom Chandler , C.O , Nathan James . Pleasure to meet you . This is Lieutenant Landau . - Ma 'am . - Sir . Hey . How y 'all doin ' ? Just fine , now that you 're here . We can escort you guys back to our H.Q. Here comes another van . Cobra 1 in place . All clear on the beach . Holy shit . What ? Mom ? I had to come see for myself . Oh , my baby girl . It 's her . It 's Granderson . She came out herself . I am so glad to have you back . Captain Chandler , thank you . Thank you for returning my daughter to me . Privilege , ma 'am . We wouldn 't be here without her . Take the shot . Mrs. Granderson , we really need to get you back in the vehicle . She 's blocked . Come . Everyone 's eager to meet you . I can take out the fat man . No ! You only have one shot . - I want her . - Nathan James , looks like we 're having a bit of a family reunion here . We 're headed out with the group . Sending Lieutenant Norris and some troopers back with the V.B.S.S to update you on the situation on the ground , Sir . Roger that . We 'll arrange a welcome for Lieutenant Norris . Oh , and say " Hi " to mom for us . Damn it ! I lost her . Talk to your friends on the inside . Find out what they 're doing here . We were fortunate to find this building . There 's only one coal-fired plant still operational , and we have a direct line . Plus , strategically we 're far enough from the city to avoid infection . You 'll be safe here . Come . Mom , this is amazing . Oh , yes , but it 's been a battle . And who 's the enemy ? Warlords , they call themselves . And recently , they 've killed more people than the actual virus . Do you know they raided the National Archives ? They actually tried to steal original copies of the Constitution . As if that could take away who we are as a people . Captain . I didn 't want to broadcast about the virus over an open radio feed , but ... the President told me that you had the materials to produce a vaccine . Is that true ? Yes , ma 'am . We 've actually made a little more progress than that , Mrs. Granderson . We have the cure . Fort Detrick was our first option , too . They had the lab and all , but , uh , - Thorwald got there first . - Thorwald . Former Baltimore P.D. Turned self-proclaimed leader of the warlords . Been a real pain in our ass since this whole thing started . I shouldn 't complain . I imagine you 've been through a hell of a time yourselves . Listen , Lieutenant , last I talked to my wife , she said was taking the family to Deer Park . Safe zone . Heard of it . You know if it 's still there ? There was fighting , but there are survivors . I can get you there as soon as we get you off the ship . Ooh ! Thanks , doc . You have no idea how good that felt . Well , I have some idea . Yeah . What were the results of the test ... See , these results are consistent ... Now this is the main reason we chose this building . We 've worked for months trying to develop a cure . But now you 're here . It 's heavenly . You 're not gonna like this , boss . My guy inside Granderson 's said the ship came back with a cure . It could be bullshit . We 've heard this before . Not from the U.S. Navy . If that 's true , Granderson will spread out , go anywhere she wants . We will lose the city . We need to get our hands on the cure . It 's probably locked away somewhere on the ship . The only way is to take Granderson on directly . We have to take her lab . Extraordinary . Look at her . She 's in love with a toaster . You still haven 't made your move yet ? Oh , I 've been making my move since Gitmo . She ain 't buying what I 'm selling . I thought once she saved the world , she 'd let loose a little . Nathan James , this is Vulture One . Do you copy ? This is her letting loose . I repeat ... Nathan James , this is Vulture One . Do you copy ? I can 't get through , Sir . You won 't get a signal here , Master Chief . The Warlords are jamming the local frequencies . They have a radio room , Sir . I let the X.O. know where we are . Ma 'am , uh , if that radio room is still available , I 'd like to get word to my family , See if they 're still out there . I think it 's time you thought of yourself . Meanwhile , we can work with your team to arrange safe transit here for your ship 's crew . - Due to warlord activity ... - This is Tom Chandler , listening on a spread spectrum , looking for Jed Chandler in Clearwater , Virginia , - or parts nearby , over . - Citizens are advised to avoid these areas until further notice . - Power has been ... - This is Tom Chandler , listening on a spread spectrum , looking for Jed Chandler in Clearwater , Virginia , or parts nearby , over . ... and some city services are set to resume . This is Tom Chandler , looking for Jed Chandler in Clearwater , Virginia , over . This is Tom Chandler , looking for Jed Chandler in Clearwater , Virginia , over . Howdy . Tex . Hey , listen , just wanted to let you know that I 'm heading off . Heading off ? What are you talking about ? I 'm moving on . By yourself ? But it 's chaos out there . I 've seen worse . And thanks to you , I can travel wherever I like . Where will you go ? I , uh , got things to take care of . The young girl whose picture that you keep in your locket . Among other things , yeah . Anyway , you seem to have things plenty well in hand here . Right then . Oh , you 're a special woman , you know that ? You take care now . What the hell . This is Tom Chandler , looking for Jed Chandler in Clearwater , Virginia , over . This is Tom Chandler , U.S. Navy , looking for Jed Chandler in Clearwater , Virginia , over . - Tom ? - Dad ? Dad ? Are you there ? It 's me . It 's Tom . I 'm back ! - Tom ? - I 'm here , dad . Tommy ? Are you at the cabin ? - We 're going to ... Baltimore . - Baltimore ? ! Are you with the kids ? ! Darien ? ! We 're sick . We had to leave the cabin . Going to Olympia . It 's our only hope for a cure ... Come quick . We 're sick ! Tell me exactly where you are . What do you see ? - Onyx Truck Stop . - Truck stop ? What happened ? Are you on the road ? Onik truck stop . It 's a tire shop downtown . We can get you there . Listen to me . Stay put . I 'm coming for you . Put these jackets on . You 'll blend in better . We 're in and out , gentlemen . Dad ! Dad ? - Let 's get eyes . 360 . - Darien ? Dad ? ! Darien ? ! Where did you get this radio ? Where did you get this radio ? ! Answer me ! It 's mine now . The man you took this radio from , where did he go ? ! - Man , everybody 's going to the same place - Where did he go ? ! - The arena ! - Where ? ! What arena ? ! - Olympia ! - Olympia . Come on ! Let 's go ! - Can 't do that , sir . - What do you mean ? Olympia 's off-limits . It 's for sick people . But we 're immune . You got the shots , too . Get back in the car . We 're going back to base . We 're going to Olympia . You don 't give the orders , captain . Get back in the cars ! Drop your weapons ! - Get back in the car ! - Drop your weapons ! You don 't want to do this , trooper ! We 're on the same side ! Everybody calm down ! Master chief ! I 'm all right ! I 'm okay . Nathan James , this is vulture two . Come in ! Damn it , still can 't get through ! Take the truck , get the master chief back to the ship . - And tell the X.O. what 's going on ! - What is going on ? ! Find a way to get the others back to the ship . We 're getting out of Baltimore . You okay ? What about us ? We 're going to Olympia . You 'll inform the others then ? Very good . Everything okay ? Yeah . All good . Everthing 's under control . I want to try and look for Sarah . I-if you survived , there 's a chance that maybe she 's still okay . Alisha ... Your friend lived in Wisconsin . There 's no way to get there now . - Soon , maybe . - But if we make ... Soon . Now ... Tell me this ... What kind of man is Captain Chandler ? He 's amazing . Without him , we wouldn 't have gotten through any of this . So he hasn 't the let the power go to his head ? I 'm not sure I understand the question . I 'm asking if he will still follow orders . Follow orders from whom ? Mother , what 's going on ? Michael , have you seen these protocols ? Of course . Why ? Well , Dr. Hamada claims that his treatment prolongs the lives of the infected . But his whole assumption about the virus seems to be wrong . I 'm just a statistician , but the data he 's given me suggests the treatment 's working . No , that 's impossible . - Is something wrong ? - Dr. Hamada , you 're using ribavirin to introduce higher error rates to the virus ' D.N.A. replication . In a chemical cocktail , yes . Yes , but the pandemic virus is error-free . Your treatment wouldn 't have any positive effect whatsoever . In fact , these dose levels are highly toxic . Go through the turnstile and wait for assessment . Daddy ? Daddy ? - Daddy ! - Ashley ! - Daddy ! - Ashley ! - Daddy ! - Oh , my god . Sammy ... Sammy ... Daddy ... daddy ... we 're sick . I know , baby . I know . Daddy 's gonna make it better , okay ? Where 's mommy ? Tommy ... Where 's your mother ? - Tommy ... - Dad , why didn 't you wait for me ? Sam , a little pinch . A little pinch . This is gonna make you feel better . Tommy ... Where is she ? Son , I 'm sorry . Dad , where 's Darien ? ! She 's gone , son . She 's gone . I tried to do everything I could to save her . I tried . I tried . I know you did , pop . I know you did . But right now I gotta give you this . You stack the cases by the hangar door , we 'll put ' em on a pallet and unload ' em dockside as soon as we make port . I 'm not sure exactly when that 's gonna be ... Oh , hey , Norris , answer a question for us if you could . Yes , sir . Commander . Commander ! I want you to get on the horn and give the order to drop anchor . You muster your entire crew on the flight deck and you open up the door to the helo bay where you 're storing the cure . I 'm not giving you a goddamn thing , you son of a bitch . I don 't know what your plan is here , but this is my ship ! - You 'll do exactly what I say , or I 'll pick off your entire crew one-by-one . My troopers are everywhere . This ship is mine now . Please , he needs help . Call Doc Rios ! Nobody moves ! Nobody moves ! Put down that weapon ! Everyone heard that gunshot . They 're gonna come running . You don 't think I 'll do it , X.O. ? ! Put down that weapon ! You think I won 't do it , X.O. ? Just try me ! I 'm not gonna tell you again , commander . Muster your crew . Doctor . My troopers say they experienced no side effects from the cure . It 's amazing what you 've created . I wish I could say the same in return . I understand you have some questions about the way we 've been treating the sick . What you are giving the sick is anything but a treatment of that I am sure . Doctor ... You know this . In the 14th century , the black death wiped out 60 % of the European population . The plague killed indiscriminately ... the artists , scientists , thinkers , so few and precious to begin with , were wiped out . It upended the social order and prolonged the dark ages 150 years . I cannot let that happen here . I understand your allegiance to your friends . You 've gone through so much together . But you 've seen nothing of the chaos here at home . The hysteria , the cruelty , the savagery . You must try to see the situation from our point of view . There are people out there who would use this crisis to take what does not belong to them . They are the barbarians at the gate who would send us into a new dark age . We have the power to stop them , to keep them in their place . It is my duty to help the right people first , the people whose survival will ensure the future of our entire society ... and all that we hold dear . So you gather your elite few within these walls . And the rest ... What happens to them ? The virus doesn 't discriminate . That unfortunate task falls to me . Pl ... Plea ... plea ... Please ... Hey , what are you doing ? You can 't be here ! You 're killing them . Get the hell back behind the curtain ! - You 're killing them ! - Stay back ! - You sick bastards ! - Hey , you can 't be here ! Captain , we gotta move ! Security breach in section 12 . Repeat ... security breach in section 12 . I don 't ... I don 't ... I don 't get it . They 're burning ' em . They 're burning the bodies to power the city . I know it 's hard to understand . You 've been away so long . But in time , Rachel , you 'll see it 's the only way . She was trying to run . Dr. Scott , I swear I had no idea this was happening . - I swear ... - Hush , dear . You can 't replicate my work with the doses that I 've given you . Everything that you need is locked up on that ship . And the captain will never give it up . You let me worry about the captain . Daddy ... We have to go . Nathan James , come in . Do you read me ? Nathan James , come in . Do you read me ? Nathan James , this is the captain . Come in . Do you read me ? Nathan James , come in . Do you read me ? Nathan James , this is the captain . Come in . Do you read me ? Nathan James , where are you ?

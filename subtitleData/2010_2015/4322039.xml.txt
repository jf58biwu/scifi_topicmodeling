 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... We have competition . MacPherson . Who ? Leena , I know him . He was Joshua 's physics professor . Professor Reynolds . The Phoenix . Those who touch the Phoenix , they will be spared . What is it ? It looks like Claudia was the last one to have access to the Phoenix . The Thimble . James MacPherson , you 're under arrest . We 'll put him in the Bronze Sector . What we do is we flash freeze the bodies cryogenically and we preserve them by bronzing . Something 's wrong . Turn around . Yes , ma 'am . Thank you for remembering our appointment . Artie ! Wait ! Wait ! Wait for us ! Artie ! Do you think there is any way he could have survived ? I don 't know . Quickly , we don 't have much time . Why ? Huh ? Why didn 't he wait for us ? What are we going to do ? Top of my list is kill that son of a bitch MacPherson . Oh , my God . Pete . Pete , what is that ? I don 't know . Get back over here , it might be ... No , I don 't ... I don 't think it is . Oh , my God . Are you getting a vibe ? A good one . So that 's how it works . Artie ! Artie ? Hey . Ah ! Oh , my God , it 's really you . You scared the hell out of us . We thought for sure you were a goner . I 'm all right . I 'm fine . It 's just that I don 't know how I ... I 've never been so happy to see you . Oh , thanks . I 'm good . I 'm good . Oh , God . I know . But , Artie , how could you possibly have survived ? The Phoenix ? Wait a minute . If you used the Phoenix , that means someone 's going to die , right ? One of us ? I don 't know . But , Artie ... Pete ? Pete ! No , no , no . Pete ! Artie , do something ! Just hang on ! Hang on ! Artie ! No . I 'm okay . No , I was choking . It was dust or something . You 're okay ? Yeah , just ... Oh , God . What , was I choking on you , Artie ? That 's ... Ugh ! Are you all right ? Artie , if it 's not Pete , then , um ... Mrs. Frederic ! Mrs. Frederic 's in there . Artie ! I got to get her out ! Artie , wait ! Wait ! What is that ? There ! So it was Mrs. Frederic , then . I promised myself I wouldn 't cry . Did you have any trouble ? No . But I 'd recommend 24 hours isolation from light . I 'll contact you with instructions . Until then , you know what to do . Yes . I 'll take care of it all . Come on , old friend . You 've got a great deal to catch up on . Welcome to the future . Let 's change it , shall we ? This is my fault . If I hadn 't kissed the Phoenix then your driver would be alive and you wouldn 't be ... I 'm sorry . We need you . Find Claudia . Joshua ... MacPherson 's playing the long game . Rewind it again . - Again . - No . I don 't want to watch any more of that . I mean , look , I don 't believe that Claudia would ... Come on , Myka , that can 't be right . Look , I know it 's hard , Pete , but it 's right there in front of us . Okay , maybe MacPherson did do something to her but she 's gone . She ran . Innocent people don 't run . Whoa . Leena , what 's wrong ? Are you okay ? Yes . I ... It 's nothing . Leena , we got to replace that umbilicus . I cannot do those stairs 15 times a day . Artie , what ... Artie , what did you find out about ... Look , look , look , listen . Claudia popped up on the grid . Looks like she 's headed to Switzerland . Switzerland , why ? It 's to CERN . It 's to CERN . It 's that nuclear research place where Joshua works . He is her only family . She 's got no place else left to go . And listen , if Claudia and Joshua are ... No . ... if they are both working for MacPherson now ... No , no . She 's not . I know she 's not and so do you , Artie . Pete , nobody wants to believe it , all right ? But that 's irrelevant . Now look , while I 'm gone , I want both of you ... Wait , wait , you 're going to CERN now ? Yes , of course . Then we 're going with you . You bet your ass . No , absolutely not . You have to go over this place with a fine-toothed comb . MacPherson has had hours , hours of unfettered access . God only knows what that man has done . So start in the Bronze Sector , and retrace his steps and maybe , maybe that will tell us where he is right now . Artie , just be careful , okay ? I mean , we don 't know much , but we know that MacPherson is out there and ... He already killed you once . Yeah . I got to go . This thing is useless , okay ? I 'm getting nothing . The Durational Spectrometer only reads energy shadows from the last five hours . You okay ? Yeah . Yeah , I am now . Five hours ago I would have screamed like a little girl . Pete ? Yeah . Look at this . It looks like something heavy was dragged through here . Something heavy , and something bronze . So what ? You think our Jimmy took a play date ? If there 's a history log in here , we could look up ... There . This says that the de-bronze function was activated twice . Okay , so one 's for MacPherson , but who 's our mystery guest ? Well , let 's ... This place just gets more interesting every day . I don 't get it . Why H.G. Wells ? What does MacPherson want with him ? All I can find on the Bronze Sector is a list of its residents and H.G. Wells isn 't even on that list . Yeah , I mean if that place is reserved for the worst of the worst , what is Wells even doing in there ? Maybe there 's a clue in one of Wells' books because our library is amazing . I know . First editions of everything that 's ever been printed . Does that include comic books ? Really ? That 's your first thought ? No , but you definitely wouldn 't like my first thought . You 're right . Did you know that my dad used to read me H. G. Wells when I was a kid ? Yeah , nothing like a little War of the Worlds to put a toddler to sleep . You 've read War of the Worlds ? Uh , no , but I saw the movie . Tom Cruise was awesome ! Oh , and Brando in Island of Doctor Moreau , " I could have been a scientist . " Great , great , now all we need is Angelina to do A Modern Utopia and you 'll be all caught up . Yahtzee . It was broken into . What was ? The H.G. Wells home museum in London three months ago , but interesting , nothing was taken . If you 're looking for something in H.G. Wells ' house and you can 't find it , why not ask H.G. Wells ? MacPherson used Claudia to gain access to Wells . You watch , we 're going to find out she 's in the clear . Okay , let 's go . Well , go where ? To London . I got a vibe about this thing . I bet Wells is there . Let 's go to London . That 's what I 'm talking about . Joshua , thank God you 're there . Where are you ? That doesn 't look like ... Listen to me . Okay . You remember Professor Reynolds from college ? Yeah , of course . Okay . His real name is MacPherson . What ? What are you ... - And he 's actually ... - Miss , you about done there ? It 's really complicated , and they 're gonna kick me off this thing in a sec . But listen , if he tries to contact you , do not trust him . Okay ? He 's a bad , bad guy . And maybe I am , too , I don 't know . Claudia . Claud , what 's going on ? I 'll explain when I get there . Here ? You 're going to come to CERN ? There 's no place else to go , okay ? I can 't go back to Artie and I 'm not going back to the International House of nut jobs . Joshua , are you busy ? No , Dr. LeFevre , please come in . I know I sound crazy . I 'll see you soon . Love you . Yeah , love you , too . Sorry , Doctor , that 's my sister . Joshua , I 'm going to be raising your clearance level . I want your help removing some material from the lab . Of course . Yeah , Doctor , anything you say . Doctor . So was H.G. Wells one of the Munsters ? This place is a dump . How do you not have jet lag ? Because I slept on the plane . I mean , how many times can you watch Marley Me ? It 's so sad . Right . Let 's all gather around , shall we ? We 're going to get started . I told you we should 've had this place closed and locked down . No , no , no , that 'd be like shooting off a big flare . " Hey , H.G. , looky here , we 're waiting for you . " Sorry . Hi . Hello . Pete . We are working . Working it , okay ? You know how long it 's been ? Way too . There 's no reason for me not to get my groove on . Pete , look at this . " Edward Prendick . " Bet junior high was fun for him , huh ? No , from The Island of Doctor Moreau . You would know him as Marlon Brando . H.G. Is here . The actual inspiration for the Heat Ray came from a tour of Big Ben I was given by Her Majesty , Victoria . Lovely woman , terrible breath . You got to admit this guy 's got some cojones . Pete , wait ... All right , Wells , show 's over . I beg your pardon ? Sorry , ma 'am . Government business . United States Secret Service . You don 't look like much of a threat to me , but if MacPherson wants you out , then we want you in . Now let 's go . How dare you ? Take your hands off me . You two , I thought you might be trouble , coming in late . Ma 'am , we apologize . No , we don 't . Yes , we do , Pete . He 's an impersonator . We don 't know that . The best place to hide is right out in the open . He has a fake mustache . All right ? Name 's Walter Frith . Americans . H.G. Wells died in 1946 . Myka , I 'm really vibing out here , okay ? And I don 't like it . Ma 'am , can I speak with you outside , please ? Yes , I 'd like to speak with you . Oh ! Artie , what the hell ? You 're fired . We 're really very sorry about this . You can come back tomorrow . Yeah , sorry , guys . Thank you . Sorry . Sorry . Thank you . Sorry . Nice jacket . Hey , sorry about the mustache thing . It was ... Okay . Okay , so if nobody in this group signed in as Edward Prendick , that means that Wells must have come and gone already . All right , so maybe we can find out what he took . Hey , so what did you say to Mary Poppins , anyway ? Oh , I just told her that you were a mental patient who thought he was Wells' long-lost boyfriend . No , you didn 't . Did you ? Nice . That 's not even funny . Do you think that he could still be using her in somehow ? There 's my access address ... If he wants it ... Just toggle back to the last person ... This place is my home . I would never do anything ... Claudia , I 'm sorry . I would never do anything ... That 's probably why they bronzed him . Neanderthals . Oh , oh ! Oh , man , no ... Oh , my God , I 'm so sorry . I didn 't know anyone was still here and ... I didn 't know it was you and I 'm sorry . No , I do beg your pardon , I seem to have left my notebook here . Yeah . We left in such a hurry . Right . Yeah , that was ... That was kind of our fault , so I 'm really sorry . I 'll just come back another ... No , no , no , no . Uh , let me help you out . You know , hands across the water and all that . Yeah . Well , that 's very sweet of you . Some Americans really are quite nice . Yeah , for a Brit , you ain 't half bad yourself . " What ? What ? " If I had a Farnsworth , you easily could have called me . Why call when I can fly 5,000 miles in coach ? Ow . What did you hit me with ? Nothing . My hand . What are you doing here anyway ? If I 'm some kind of freaky double agent , I have to be as far away ... Okay , first , are you planning on running for the rest of your life ? Because that 's what it 's going to take to get me off your back . I 'm sorry . I needed to see Joshua . I needed to see somebody who knows me . And second , why can 't you just trust me ? I 'm kind of smart . Maybe the two of us can figure this out . You know , and I know you , too , kiddo . So you think maybe I 'm not a double agent ? I think maybe I can take the risk . Don 't make me regret it . Okay . Because I 'm not , you know . We 'll see . Ah , that was not your hand . No , it wasn 't . Okay . Oh ! First thing , we have to make sure Professor Reynolds hasn 't gotten to Joshua . I figure if he got to me , he might try to go for Josh ... MacPherson is Reynolds . Yeah , you already know that . I know , I know it , but I didn 't really think about it because when the position first came up at CERN , the director mentioned the name Reynolds . No ! Yes . I didn 't know at the time that MacPherson was Reynolds . That 's what she meant by , " He 's playing the long game . " We have to get to CERN immediately . That 's what I 've been saying . I 'm Pete by the way . Helena . You know , I think our two countries might be able to work out their differences . I 'd say we 're well on our way to detente . Fill me in . Well , hello to you , too . Where are you ? Geneva . Fill me in . We 're ... We 're in London . I told you to stay at the Warehouse . Will there ever come a time when the two of you , anyone for that matter , does as they are told ? Artie , look , MacPherson de-bronzed H.G. Wells . What ? Wait . Is everything all right ? No . No . I got a really bad feeling . Pete . Pete . In here . Pete , Artie says that H.G. Wells is actually ... A woman . A really hot woman . Maybe good with a gun . Yeah , he left out the gun part . Okay , so H.G. Wells is actually a woman . I 'm going to have to process this . Yeah , well , make it fast , will you ? And could you please be careful with that ? Okay , it 's a Tesla , and up close it just might be ... Lethal . I know all about it . I brought it to the Warehouse . You what ? I was apprenticed at Warehouse 12 . Nikola Tesla and I met at the Chicago World Fair in 1893 . You are rocking my world , lady . Perhaps you 'd like to tell me why you 're ransacking my home . Ransacking your home ? Well , that has a distinctive ring tone to it . What does that mean ? Oh , it 's an American expression that means , " Gotcha . " C is for cookie That 's good enough for me I 'll take that . I 'd hate to have to hit a sweet old Victorian lady . I , on the other hand , have no problem shooting one . Oh , cookie , cookie Cookie starts with C You know , it was just rude . I thought English people were supposed to be polite . Why are you protecting James MacPherson ? He tried to kill the both of us and believe me , he will turn on you . Don 't they all ? Who ? Men . Eventually . Neanderthals . You know , for somebody who 's been unconscious for 100 years , you 've really held on to some anger . Not unconscious . Just immobile . Right . What ? You mean while you 're bronzed , you 're awake ? We didn 't know that . Offers a lady time to think . So what did you come here for ? Yeah , look , you either tell us what and where it is or watch us tear this whole place apart looking for it . Pull out the second drawer down on the right . Empty it out , turn it over . Pull open the panel on the back . What 's this ? Go over to the bottom set of shutters . Grasp the top inner vents on each side and close them simultaneously . Un , deux , trois . And voila . That will show you the hiding place Mr. MacPherson had so much trouble locating . Here we go . Hey-o ! " Put the candle back . " Young Frankenstein . Never mind . Okay , just keep her covered , Pete . So do you want to tell us about this ? It 's a family heirloom . Right . Why did MacPherson want it ? I have no idea . Pete , the wiring on the vest matches the wiring on the switch . Yeah , the wiring on the vest matches the wiring on the switch . That has nothing to do with the vest . Oh , of course we believe you . Yeah , right , why wouldn 't we ? You want to do the honors ? I do . Oh , what the hell ? Thank goodness these things haven 't changed much . How come you 're not affected ? Magnetic boots . Specially made . That explains why my head still hurts . I guess we know now why they bronzed you . Don 't speculate upon things about which you know nothing . Ooh , there 's that anger again . Well , there must be some reason why they bronzed you . The world was a different place . A century ago , it was easier to believe in the possibility of a time machine than of the reality that a woman thought one up . Well , if you wrote those novels then who was H.G. Wells ? My brother Charles was the writer . I supplied the ideas , the research . Charles supplied the mustache . Oh , hey , I 'm digging the iron vest , by the way . It brings out your eyes . Who 's angry now ? So do all your dates work out this way ? On a scale of one to ten , I 'm giving this one a seven . Is this Joshua 's department ? The anti-matter storage facility is part of this building somewhere . I just ... I don 't know where . This place is huge . Josh ! Joshua ! Claudia ! Wait a minute ! What ? I 'm a what ? Get off me ! Are you all right ? Claudia , what 's happening ? Joshua , give me the briefcase . Claudia , his hand ! Look at this hand ! Thanks for all your help . Joshua ! Joshua ! I 'll admit it . I thought she was hot , but she 's also obviously a ... Cavorite . Yeah , yeah , I 'm sure she was that , too . No , Cavorite was an anti-gravity metal that Wells wrote about but Cavorite doesn 't exist . I mean , there 's no such thing . Myka , in this job , there 's no such thing as " no such thing . " We just met the female H.G. Wells , for crying out loud . Good point . So how do we shut down Cavorite ? Maybe she ran some sort of electric current through it to increase its properties ? Right . What the hell , then ? What are you doing ? Fighting fire with fire . What ? If I could just ram the Tesla into this ... Hold on . Or don 't . Oh ! That 's a high ceiling . Yeah ! Artie . We have a problem . Yeah , Artie , so do we . She got away . Yeah , she took off in this , I don 't know , cool , iron steampunky vest thing . It looked more like an artifact than a fashion choice . He 's fine . He 's fine . Come here . Come here . Hack in , run a search on H.G. Wells inventions , specifically those not in the Warehouse . On it . Now , listen ... Are you with Claudia ? Is she okay ? Where did you find her ? Guys , I 'm okay . Joshua broke his leg ... All right , everybody stop . Bigger fish . Now , did you actually talk to H. G. Wells ? What is she up to ? She ? Later . She really wasn 't very talkative . Artie , did you know that when you 're bronzed you can still think ? Yes . All right , check it . " The Imperceptor Vest . Wearer can move fast enough to be imperceptible " to the naked eye . " I don 't know . She had it on , nothing happened . I would have thought she 'd have used it . Well , is it operational ? According to the schematics , it needs a small but very powerful energy source . Which wouldn 't have existed 100 years ago . - But she probably can find one now . - Yeah . Like , for instance , anti-matter . I still don 't understand why she needs the vest . The Escher Vault . That 's why they need the anti-matter , to power the vest to get through the Escher Vault . And what is the Escher Vault ? It 's where the personal effects are kept of anyone who 's been bronzed , and to get through that , she would need something like the Imperceptor . So where 's the vault ? It 's in the Warehouse . They 're going back to the Warehouse . He knew we would follow him . He wants the Warehouse empty . You stupid ... Artie , if Claudia 's not the breach , and it 's obvious that you don 't think she is , that leaves only ... Leena . Mrs. Frederic , you 're here . So it would appear . Are you all right ? I thought you were supposed to be in the hospital . When the explosion happened , where were you , exactly ? I was at the Warehouse . You don 't remember . You 've been having lapses , blackouts , sometimes you even wake up in a different place . How do you know that ? Look at me . What was that ? As I suspected . Drink this . Not too much . What is it ? Absinthe . You tried to kill me . Yeah , sorry about that . But I had no choice . There 's no other way to remove the pearl . The pearl ? What are you talking about ? The pearl of wisdom . MacPherson must have planted it in your inner ear weeks ago . Do you recall a night when you had bad dreams ? Yes . Yes , over a month ago . Horrible nightmares . That was the pearl attaching itself . If a person uses it properly , they can control your thoughts and movements . No , but the tape . It was Claudia who de-bronzed MacPherson . Think . See it clearly now . Harriet Tubman 's thimble . It was me . Mrs. Frederic , it was me . It 's done . Why are you wearing those beads ? Well , if I remove them , my blood will eat through my own veins . Oh . Little gift from an old friend . We have to assume they 're not too far behind us . Not to worry . I 've created a few diversions just in case . There . The anti-matter 's attached . Let 's see if this works or if it kills me . Shall we ? Behind you . I 'm impressed . So pleased it didn 't kill you . That seemed very easy . Access to the Escher Vault is not the issue . Twenty years ago , a curious agent entered the vault and hasn 't been heard from since . I do hope you don 't run into him . We 're taking the long way around . MacPherson will expect us to take the most direct route . How 'd we beat Pete and Myka back ? Something to do with destruction of historical landmarks . I spoke to Scotland Yard . Anyway , you left the packet out for them , right ? On your desk . Why do MacPherson and Wells need the vest ? Why can 't they just walk in ? Because the Escher Vault is a maze of stairs and walkways , constantly rapidly moving . If you don 't have a way to navigate it , you 're lost in there for a lifetime . Now , if Wells can figure out a way to make the vest operational , she can move quickly enough to get right through it . So what if we de-activate everything ... Claudia , either run or lecture . I cannot do both . This is running ? Wait . Something is off . How can you tell ? Take a whiff . Fudge . Right there . Boom goes the dynamite . Yeah . Chameleon Mines . They blend into the landscape so you can 't see them . MacPherson . Yeah . We 're going to have to find an alternate route . Again ? I don 't smell fudge . I have to think like him . He knew I would make it this far . He knew I would test it and he will expect me to turn around so ... Wait . Now you 've got me doing it . Look . Dante 's death mask . So ? So I do a lot of inventory . It doesn 't belong there . Nice catch . How come it didn 't go off before ? Because we triggered it on the way through , he wants to box us in and he 's done that . Okay , well , the flames only go up eight rows . All we have to do is climb 20 , run across the top and climb down . All we have to do ? On the upside , you 'll be able to work off some of those extra pounds you 've been griping about . Devil child . When do I get one of those ? Two weeks after never . Artie , what 's going on ? Great . You 're back . Now listen to me , do not deviate one iota from what I 'm about to tell you . Got it , Artie , we 're on our way . Wait . Wait . This place is full of booby traps . You 're going to have to take a long circuitous route . Aside from that , hurry ! Or ... Ooh . Yeah . Hey , if you 're going to grab me like that , I need some sweet talk . Just shut up and drive ! Watch out ! We 're going to hit that . It should be me driving . Would you just let me steer ? Or that . That works , too . Oh , did you get it ? Mission accomplished . Where 's the vest ? I left it behind . It was spent . Well , then . All said and done , it wasn 't terribly difficult . Hmm . Before we go , should we celebrate ? What exactly did you have in mind ? Oh , you really are the most unpredictable woman . Took you long enough . I thought I was going to have to kiss that . Oh . Game over , huh ? A long way to go for nothing , hey , James ? I still have some bargaining left . Wells is still in the vault , Arthur . I know what the plan is . Let me go ! I 'll tell you everything . I 'm disappointed but not surprised . James ! James ! I knew you 'd use it . Use what ? The Phoenix . You put it in my pocket . I wanted you to see what I saw . The darkness . The emptiness . That it 's all for nothing . No , James , I saw light and peace . I felt nothing but hope . - Hope ? - Yeah . But all this time I thought I knew the truth . I 'm sorry , Arthur . So she 's gone . There 's absolutely no trace of her . None . I found the vest outside . So is she dangerous ? I mean , do we really need to find her ? Yes . And absolutely . We can 't just have H.G. Wells wandering around the world . No , no , no , no , no . We let her out , got to put her back . It was completely different . That is so disgusting . You 're acting like I did this on purpose . Totally not true . If anybody should be shell-shocked about this , I think it should be me . I don 't see it that way , since I was the victim here . You ? You were the victim ? Yeah . Glad you 're seeing it my way . You wanted to talk to me about something ? Claudia , go easy . We 've all been through a lot . Worst case of identity theft ever . All right . Maybe this will help . No way ! Does this mean I 'm an agent now ? No . It means I can reach you any time of day or night . Okay . Not as good . Just be careful . It belonged to Philo . Philo ? As in Philo Farnsworth ? She gets Farnsworth 's Farnsworth . Artie . Don 't lose it . Okay . Hey , thanks . Thank you for coming after me . Okay , why is everybody hugging all the time around here ? I still have a bump on my head , you know ? Okay . Jealous . Not even close . Sure . Not even . Really ? Let me just see it . I don 't think so . Just want to see it . You 're going to have to chase me . Come here , you . Oh , chase me , Lattimer . Whoa , look out ! Let 's see what H. G. Took , shall we ? How do you remember that password ? I do a lot of crossword puzzles . How do we navigate once we 're in there ? That 's the trick , isn 't it ? They needed to use the Imperceptor Vest . We 've got other options . Oh . Put these on . Don 't take them off under any circumstances . Okay , this is amazing . What did I say ? Sorry . Look . There are a few items missing . Her locket , her ring . And her compact . But , why ? Why , indeed . Hey , what you working on there ? Something I 've been thinking about for a very long time .

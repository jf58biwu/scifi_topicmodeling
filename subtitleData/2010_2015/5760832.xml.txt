 Ten ... Nine , eight ... Seven , six ... Five , four ... Three , two ... One . GODZILLA Sub : Khoibeo3g , synced and edited by : PEEAN91 . Philippines , 1999 Universal Western Mining Dr. Serizawa ? Jerry Boyd . I 'm just warning you , it 's a real mess ! Just a total mess ! Monarch sent me in this morning to look around , I told them we need you .. They picked up a radiation pocket out here last month . They got excited thinking they had the unranium deposit . They started staking up the heavy machinary and then , well the ... the valley wall collapsed into a cavern below . It just dropped away . It 's just gone . Best guess right now is about forty miners went down with it . This way . When I first discovered this pocket , the radiation levels were only half this strong . It 's almost as if contact with the outside air started catalysing something . Some kind of fossil , right ? I 've been digging them for almost thirty years , I never seen anything like it . Oh , my God . Is it possible ? Is it him ? No . This is much older . Hey , guys . You gotta see this . What is it ? Some kind of egg ? A giant 's spawn ? The bones are fossilized , but this ... this formation seems to be perfectly preserved . This one looks broken . Like something came out of it . Janjira , Japan I 'll get it , it 's probably for me . Moshi moshi . No , Takashi ... No , Takashi . Just listen to me for a second I 'm asking for the meeting because if I have to shut the reactor down , you 're not gonna want to read about it in a memo . Because I 've been following these tremors since they started in the Philippines , and now they 're in our own backyard . No , no , no , no ! Hayato says I need to go through you about this . Look , I 'm just ... I 'm just trying to follow the protocols that were set forth by the company , that 's all . This is my job . He 's awake . Oh , I know . He got up early . What are we gonna do ? Get dressed , I 'll figure it out . Okay . See you later , Dad . With all due respect , Takashi , and honor . Respect and honor , with all of that I 'm an engineer and I don 't like unexplained frequency pattern in your plant , where I 'm responsible . I need a meeting , make it happen ! Oh-hi-yo . Arigato Bye , Mom ! He made you a sign . What ? Your birthday sign . - He worked so hard . - My God . I 'm gonna come home early , I 'll take the car and pick him up and we can get a proper cake . Okay ? Listen , I need to know that it 's not the sensors . Okay ? I can 't be calling this meeting and look like the American maniac . So when we get there , don 't even bother coming up . Just grab a team and go down to level five . You 're not a maniac . I mean , you are , just not about this . There must be something we 're not thinking of . Happy birthday . What ... is it ? Yes , it is . I forgot all about it ! - Happy birthday . - Thank you . I should have a birthday tomorrow . - What is this ? - Seismic anomaly . This graph is minutes ... X is minutes , not days . This is now . Wait , hold on . Seismic activity ? Seismic like an earthquake ? Are you talking about earthquakes ? No , earthquakes are random , jagged . This is consistent , increasing . This is a pattern . Alright , let 's make this quick . Takashi , what the hell is going on ? Have you seen this ? Yeah . Maybe not such a good time for a meeting . What 's the source ? Where is the epicenter ? We don 't know , but it keeps getting stronger . It 's gotta be centered somewhere . Hayato ? No one else is reporting it . We are contacting every other plant in the Kanto region . Tokai , Fujiyama , they are unaffected . But my guess is these readings are just aftershocks from the Philippines earthquake . Are we at full function ? Yes , we are . But perhaps we should be drawing down to be safe . You take us off line . - Now , Joe , we gotta ... - Do it now ! Wind it down . Sandra ? Sandra , are you there ... ? We 're turning back ! Let 's go ! Oh , my God ! Joe , are you there ? Joe , we 've been breached ! We 're heading back the containment field ! Sandra , listen to me . You need to get out of there . Run . If there 's been a reactor breach you won 't last five minutes , with or without the suits . Do you hear me ? M I hear you ! We 're coming ! I 'll meet them down there myself . Put the safety doors on manual override . No , I cannot do that ! Keep the doors open ! My wife is still in there ! Come on , let 's go ! Takashi , tell me these doors are on manual . Manual , yes . But , Joe , we have gotten a breach ! I 'm right here , as soon as they 're through I 'll see to it . Sandra , honey , can you hear me ? I 'm at the door . Sandra ! Sandra , I 'm waiting for you . I 'm at the check point , you have to run now . - You have to run as fast as you can ! - I am ! Kenji ! Kenji , we need to go ! Joe ! Joe ! Close the door ! Seal the corridor or the whole city will be exposed ! Sandra ! - Joe ! Joe , can you hear me ? - Yes . - Are you there ? - Sandra . Sandra , I 'm here . Can you hear me ? Yes . Joe , it 's too late . We 're not gonna make it . No , don 't say that ! Don 't you say that ! Run as hard as you can , honey ! Joe , you have to close the door ! You have to live , for our son ! Joe , seal the door ! Now ! Five seconds ! Four seconds ! I 'm sorry . Take care of Ford . Be a good father and ... I 'll do tell him we didn 't make it . Hurry out ! Come on , hurry up ! Come on , Ford ! 15 YEARS LATER On your feet ! You got family waiting for you ? I hope so . How long have you been away ? Fourteen months . Take it slow . It 's the one thing they don 't train you for . Alright ! Let 's go ! - I can 't tell you . - Can I see it ? Don 't let him see ! Don 't let him see ! Welcome Home , Daddy Woh ! Oh , my God ! - It 's a welcome home cake . - Oh , my God . Look at that . That 's you and that 's me . What 's it say ? " Welcome home , Daddy . " - Daddy 's home . - Daddy 's home ! Cake every night . - That is not happening ! - Daddy 's home equals cake every ... How did you manage to get chocolate on your eyeball ? Daddy did it . I can 't sleep with you making all this noise . Let 's get you into bed . Okay , baby . Time to hit the rack . Dad ? Yeah ? You still gonna be here tomorrow ? Yeah . Come on , let 's get some sleep . Turns around , nose to nose and goes , " At ease , Lieutenant . " Yeah , I missed your laugh . I missed you . No ... It could be work , I need to get that . Hello ? Yeah , this is uh ... this is Mrs. Brody . Tell ' em you 're busy , tending to your husbands needs . Yeah , he 's my husband . Tell them we 're not gonna buy it . Yes . Could you just hold one moment ? It 's the Consulate . Joe 's been arrested in Japan . Elle , I can 't find my pants . They 're in the other drawer . So why was he trespassing in the quarantine zone ? Why do you think ? Lone crusader for the truth . He has crackpot , cuckoo theories . Your father is a good man , he just ... he needs your help right now . Ford , he 's lost everything . Yeah , so did I. But you know what , I got over it . Right , I can see that . I 'm sorry . It 's just ... every time I let him in close , he always tries to drag me back . And I can 't . I can 't put our family through that . Well , he is your family . Hey , come here . You know you 're only gonna be gone for a few days , right ? And then you are gonna come back to me . Yeah , yeah . It 's not the end of the world . I don 't get many visitors . Clearly . This is you , here . Even the PhD 's don 't get much teaching English as a second language . Here we go . Ah , the towel . Alright . So .. how 's the bomb business ? It must be a growth area these days . It 's called " Explosive Ordnance Disposal " My job isn 't dropping bombs , it 's ... stopping them . - Dad ... ? - Hey , how 's Elle doing ? And Sam ? Oh , my God ! He must be , what , three , three and a half ? He 's almost five . I thought you were over this . Echolocation ? - Oh , hey . - Parasitic Communication ... No , please don 't . If you don 't mind ... everything the way I like it . - I 'm just , I 'm studying bioacoustics . - What were you doing going back there ? Oh , this trespassing stuff , that was just a bunch of bull ! - You broke the law . - I was just trying to get back to our old house . Which is in a quarantine zone ! Precisely ! The new readings are exactly like they were on that day ... And I can prove it to you . With a little bit of luck , if I can get back to ... the house , I could show you and the rest of the world ... - Dad , enough ! - ... That this was not a natural disaster . - This was not an anomaly ! - Dad ! Your mom 's out there , Ford . To me , she 'll always be there . They evacuated us so quickly , I don 't even have a picture of her . This has to stop . You know I did everything I could . You know that , right ? Let me take you home . Come home with me . We got a little boy who 's desperate to see his grandpa . We could leave tomorrow . What are you doing ? I 'm heading back out there , Ford . - No . - One hour , in and out . - I don 't think so . - I have to go ! I came back here and I wasted six years staring through that barbed wire , thinking it was a military mistake or some horrible design flaw that they were covering up . One day , I met a guy who runs a cargo boat offshore , Everyday he goes right past the reactor site , so ... He places a couple frequency monitors on buoys for me . Two weeks ago , because I check this thing like every other day , Just for the kick in the teeth . Two weeks ago , I 'm tuning in .. And , Oh my God There it is .. Whatever " it " is , that 's in there , whatever " it " is they 're guarding so carefully , started talking again . And I mean ... talking . I have to go back to our house . I need my old discs , if they 're still there . I need the data to be able to prove a base line here , that this isn 't a fantasy , that I 'm not what you think I am . I 'm gonna find the truth , and end this , whatever it takes . Why can 't you just let her rest ? Because I sent her down there , son . This wasn 't just a reactor meltdown . I don 't want to hear this ! I know . I know you don 't , but you can 't keep running away . And , son , you can 't bury this in the past . Quarantine Zone Who spooked them ? Dad , come on . Let 's go . It 's only another two blocks . Dad ! Are we going home , or what ? Woh , woh , woh ! Hey , what are you doing ? Dad ? It 's clean . I knew it . The radiation in this place should be lethal , but there 's nothing . Thank God . Happy Birthday Are they rebuilding the plant ? I don 't know . I haven 't seen ... Ten seconds . Ten seconds . 7.2 seconds and getting stronger . Returning exponentially . That 's our new curve . Jesus , it 's worse than we thought . Excuse me , Dr. Serizawa ? Two men were just arrested in the Q Zone . We 've got bigger problems here . Let Dr. Graham take a look . She did , sir . She sent me . One of them says he used to work here , doctor . You are not fooling anybody when you say that what happened ... - ... fifteen years ago was a natural disaster . Alright ? - They found these disks and printouts in his bag . - I 'm not sure what to make of them . - It was not an earthquake , ... it wasn 't a typhoon ! Okay ? So stop ! Look I 'm ... I 'm tired of talking to you about this . I want my son . I want to see my son , I want to know that he 's alright . This guy ... this guy knows . He knows where he is . I want my son . And I want my bag and disks ! And I want to talk to somebody in charge , not you . - Mr ... ? - No , not you ! I 'm done talking to you . Alright ? You 're looking at me right now , like I 'm in fish tank , right ? That 's fine , because I know what happened here . And you keep telling everybody that this place is a death zone , but it 's not ! You 're lying ! Because what 's really happening ... Is that your hiding something out there ! I 'm right ? aren 't I My wife died here ! Something killed my wife . And I have a right to know ! I deserve answers All these items , they found on him . And the date , look , fifteen years ago . I thought all the data from that day was lost . I guess not . Do you see ? Do you see ? There it is again . That is not a transformer malfunction ! That is an electrical magnetic pulse ! It effects everything electrical for miles and miles and it is happening again ! This is what caused everything in the first place ! Don 't you see that ? ! And it is gonna to send us back to the Stone Age ! You have no idea what 's coming ! Pulses are seconds apart ! They 're getting stronger . It 's effecting the power grid . Any radiation leakage ? Gamma levels are still zero , it sucked all the reactors dry . It 's done feeding . What 's this ? Jesus , it 's the same pattern . Fifteen years ago , it 's what caused the melt down ! It was an electro magnetic pulse . That 's what it 's building to ... converting all that radiation until it hatches . You have to shut down . Secure the grid ! WildFire protocols ! All personel , clear the first perimeter immediately ! What 's going on ? Hey , where are you going ? Grid 's secure . Kill it . All readings are flatlined . Get a visual . We 're losing power ! Get the backup generators online . We 're working on it . that thing fried every single circuit ! Trying to backup generators . Here we go ! Everybody out , now ! Hey ! Let me out , now ! Wait ! Wait ! Wait ! Ford ! Dad ! Well , it was absolutely unlike anything that I 've ever experienced ... Yeah , it 's uh ... Ford Brody . Uh ... Japan to San Francisco ? Okay , could ... . could I at least , ... let me leave you my cell ... Hello ? Dammit ! I 'm sorry . Hey , It 's okay . That 's okay . Daddy 's gonna be okay . Daddy 's gonna be okay . This area is now under naval military jurisdiction . All personnel report to your superiors . Dr. Serizawa ! Dr. Serizawa ! Captain Russell Hampton . Glad to find you , sir . I 've been briefed on your work with Operation Monarch . Now , I 'm told your organization has situation awareness of an unidentified creature Is that right ? I 'm here to inform you , that we 're now taking over operational authority from Monarch . So I 'm needs to come with me Is there any other personnel you need ? They will take care of you . I 'll be right next to you Them ... Alright , let 's check his vital signs . Dad .. - His pulse is weak , to 125 . - Dad . It 's okay . Dad , it 's okay . You were right . I 'm sorry . Go home to your family . Kee ... keep them safe . Okay ? Whatever it takes . Whatever ... Hey , stay with me . Dad ? Dad ! His pulse is getting weaker , I can barely feel it . We 're losing him . Joe , can you hear me ? He 's going afib Give me another Epi , one milligram . Forty units of Vasopressin . Stay with us ! Come on , Joe ! Hang in there , buddy . USS SATATOGA Coast of Japan This is our needle in a haystack , people . MUTO Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism . It is , however , no longer terrestrial , it is airborne . Now the world still thinks this was an earthquake and it would be preferable that that remains so ... Before we lost sight of it , it was headed east across the Pacific and had emitted enough EMP disruption to create havoc with our radar and satellite feeds and reduce us for the moment to a strictly visual pursuit . I emphasize for the moment , because we will get on our game , and we will find this thing . It is imperative that we do so . Captain , I want any and all search options on this table ASAP . Yes sir . Dr. Serizawa ? Admiral William Stenz . - Nice to meet you . - Glad to have you on board . Sensei . Excuse me . Lieutenant Brody ? Dr. Serizawa ? My condolences . We are deeply sorry for your loss , Lieutenant , but I 'm afraid we need you help . In 1954 , the first time a nuclear submarine ever reach the lower depths , It awakened something . The Americans first thought that it was the Russians , the Russians thought that it was them . All those nuclear bomb tests in the 50s , not tests . They were trying to kill it . Him . An ancient alpha predator . Millions of years older than mankind , from an age when the earth was ten times more radioactive than it is today . This animal , and others like it , consumed this radiation as a food source . But as the levels on the surface naturally subsided , these creatures adapted and lived deeper in the oceans . further underground , absorbing radiation from the planet 's core . The organization we work for , Monarch , was established in the wake of this discovery . A multi-national coalition formed in secrecy , to search for him , to study him , learn everything we could . We call him ... Godzilla . The top of the primordial ecosystems , a God for all intents and purposes . A monster . Fifteen years ago , we found a fossil of another giant animal in the Philippines , like Godzilla . But this creature died long ago , killed by these . Parasitic spores . One dormant , but the other hatched , catalyzed when a mining company unknowingly drilled into its tomb . The hatchling burrowed straight to the nearest source of radiation , your father 's power plant in Janjira , and cocooned there for fifteen years , absorbing it 's radioactive fuel to gestate , to grow . Until it hatched like a butterfly into the creature you saw today . Wait , wait , you knew about this ? This thing , the whole time ? Why didn 't you just kill it when you had the chance ? It was absorbing radiation from the reactors , we worried killing it might release that radiation and endanger millions . That 's why our mission was to contain it , to study its biology , to understand it . We knew the creature was having an electrical effect on everything within a close proximity . What we didn 't know ... was that it could harness this same power in an EMP attack . But your father did . He predicted it . - What else did he say ? - Please try to remember , Mr. Brody . Anything that would help us , anything at all . I didn 't listen , I just thought he was crazy . He was obsessed with all this ... something about an animal call something talking . Talking ? He said he was studying something . Echolocation . If the MUTO was talking that day , your father must have discovered something talking back . - Check again . - Yep . Search for a response call . This parasite , it 's still out there . Where ... where is it headed ? The MUTO is here , growing . It will be looking for food . The source is the radiation , we 're monitoring all known sites , - but ... but if we don 't find it soon ... - Then what ? Nature has an order , a part to restore balance . I believe he is that power . Sir , right now we 're fifty miles from Hawaii . This transport will take you there . You 'll catch a commercial flight back to San Francisco . I need you to brush you teeth . - No ... - You 're disgusting . They 're terrible ! Hey , this is Elle . You missed me , please leave a message . Elle , I don 't ... I don 't know what they 're saying on the news . There was an accident in Japan , Dad 's gone . I 'll explain when I see you . I 'm headed to Hawaii , I 'll catch a flight from there . I 'll see you soon . Keep scrolling . Near the end , before the EMP . There ... Something responded ... . HONOLULU , HAWAII - Mama ! Mama ! - Akio ! Hey , hey , hey ! Hey , hey ! Don 't worry ! Just wait there ! I 'll bring him back , okay ? - Mama ! - Hey , hey , hey ! Woh , woh , woh ! Hey , hey , hey ! Woh , kid ! Okay ! It 's okay ! We 'll bring him back ! Alright , let 's seat you down there . I 'm gonna get you back to your mom and dad , okay ? Okay . Is this what you want ? Take good care of him for me . I hope I don 't miss my flight , kid . Admiral , we received an intel report . We lost track of a nuclear Akula fifty nautical miles northwest of Hawaii , it could be the MUTO . Just got word of a missing Russian sub in the North Pacific . Martinez ? Aye , sir . Special Forces team Sparta One is picking up a distress signal , northwest of Diamond Head on the island of Oahu . They 're on the ground and headed to the beacon . Does anyone want to tell me why we 're looking for an Akula in the middle of a jungle ? Probably a glitch . Russians said they got a ping from this location . Hey , I got a reading just right up ahead . Sparta One , this is Hawkeye . We have the same ping on the transponder . Range thirty meters , looks like you 're getting warm . What the hell ? Jesus . Oh , my God . Guardian 3 , we 've located your Russian sub . You 're not gonna believe what else we 've found . Holy shit ! Appears to be rising . Must be twenty to thirty meters above the tree line . Can 't tell how wide it is . The cat 's out of the bag , no more secrets . Our highest priority now is safety . There 's close to a million people on that island . Give me our eyes on the air . We 're picking up something else , approaching from the Pacific . We need to check out that object . Check our course . Bridge , this is the Captain . - Where are you going ? - Up to the flight deck . I think he 's coming . What are you doing ? I have to see it . Two-Charlie-six , we are circling the target , go ahead and command . Standby , got a visual . Locate at 12 . We have eyes , prepare to engage target . Guardian 3 , we 're getting movement down here . Take cover ! Control , I 've lost power ! I say again , I 've lost ... You alright ? You give it ten seconds , lights gonna come back on . It 's okay . Dad ! Zoe ? Zoe ! Oh , my God . Run ! Run ! Tsunami ! Run ! Charlie to Bravo , target spotted offshore , two knots due east to your position . It could be the second bogy . There you go , what did I tell you ? Get down ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Hurry ! Go , go ! Guardian , the target 's in sight . Two o 'clock , about three hundred meters . We 're in six-zero-one . Target confirmed . Jesus ! Sam , please turn that TV off . Hey , did you hear me ? Off ! Come on , Sammy . Let 's go . Let 's go , it 's bed time ! - Sammy ! - Mommy , look . Dinosaur . Excuse me ? Hi . Excuse me , I 'm sorry . The boy 's been separated from his parents . Just fill out this form , we 'll be with you in just a minute . Hey , you got service on that cell phone ? No , the pay phones don 't even work . - Akio ! - Akio ! Mama ! Papa ! Sergeant ! Lieutenant Brody , U.S. Navy . Listen , I need your help . I 'm trying to get to the mainland . Well , it 's your lucky day , sir . Anything not tied down is moving east . Woh , woh . You 're telling me they 're heading ? Yeah , I guess we 're monster hunters now . Satellite transfer complete . Simulation 's uploaded . Satellite tracking continues . That last satellite tracks predicted the MUTO continuing due east . All our models have the targets converging on the Pacific coast . As of now , it looks like Godzilla is still following the MUTO . He 's hunting . Have our vessels maintain current distance from target . Plot the speed and heading of these things . I want to know exactly when and where they 're going to make land . Yes , sir . Doctor , what did you mean by hunting ? You think it 's chasing this MUTO ? But if the MUTO is his prey , the signal shows a call , - Why call up a predator ? - No , it didn 't . I think Godzilla was only listening . The MUTO was calling something else . The pattern . Focus the search on Nevada . Nevada ? Why would it go to Nevada ? - It can 't be , it 's impossible . - What 's impossible ? There was another spore , intact , found in the Philippian mine . But we intercepted it . We ran every test on it for years . You confirmed it for yourself , it was ... it was dormant ! Maybe not anymore . This spore , where is it now , doctor ? It was highly radioactive . It was disposed of , ... the Americans , they ... they took it ! Doctor , where is it ? Where they put all your nuclear waste . Go , go , go ! Alright , let 's go ! Get me a mark on every bomb ! Clear ! Clear ! Clear ! Clear ! Hey ! Is there anybody in there ? Captain , our UAV 's have footage of the new MUTO . Let 's have a look at it . Yes , sir . This is from five minutes ago . Oh , my God . Currently that 's all we have on it . It 's almost three hundred feet . It 's far bigger than the other one . This one doesn 't have any wings . They 're different sex ? A female . That 's who he 's been talking to . It must be a mating call . The female remained dormant until the male matured . And now they 're seeking radiation ... To reproduce . Current tracking models indicate that all three targets are converging here , San Francisco Bay . But if we rig a nuclear warhead with a shielded timer , put it on a boat and send it twenty miles out , the radiation lures the MUTOs , and the MUTOs lure Godzilla . Then we detonate , with minimal fallout risk to the city . You can 't be serious ! They feed on radiation . Correct . That 's why we use the bomb as bait . And kill them with the sheer force of the blast . This is crazy . Doctor , if you have any other ideas , I am all ears . Admiral . Yes , Doctor ? Godzilla may be the answer . I believe he 's here to restore balance , he can defeat them . And what , we just standby and watch ? I 'm sorry , doctor , I can 't take that risk . You 'll need to prep the warheads and get them moving to the coast . Yes , sir . Doctor , I know you don 't agree with this , but my first priority is to safeguard our citizens . It 's stopped . Yes . 8 : 15 in the morning , August 6 , 1945 . Hiroshima . It was my fathers . Alright , heads up ! We 've got new destination and new orders . So let 's get geared up ! Hey , Sergeant . So where ? Another one of those things popped up in Nevada , sir . Okay , everybody out ! They 're in line with each other . We are within reach of its EMP . So from here on out , it 's on the ground or it 's not at all ! Let 's go ! Alright , listen up ! This train and these weapons are headed to San Francisco ! Anyone not part of this mission disembark now ! Negative ! Can 't do it , sir . This is a high risk mission , that train out there is a national asset , not Amtrak . You 're good to . From the look of the casing on those Minuteman ICBM 's , I 'm guessing the digital module 's been bypassing , and you 're prepping for a full analog retrofit . Was my jaw supposed to drop ? I get it , you 're EOD , but I 've already got my crew and they know what they 're doing . Aim the pointy end at the monsters . Right , Sarge ? When was the last time you let one of your guys put their fingers on a live bomb ? Look , this is what I do . This is my job . Master Sergeant ? My family 's in the city . Okay ? I need to get on that train . Sam , your mom is gonna be right back , Emergency , can I help you ? Hello ? Oh , yeah . Just a sec . Elle , for you ! Well , tell them I 'll be there in a minute . Elle . It 's your husband . Hello ? Elle ? Ford ? Oh , thank God ! - Are you alright ? How 's Sam ? - You know I 've been trying to ... I 've been calling you everywhere . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . I 'm Fine . - I 've got Sam 's with me . - Great , cause I was thinking , - I want to get you both ... - I can 't believe this is happening . Ford . Are you okay ? Are you doing okay ? I 'm okay . Elle ... Elle , please don 't worry . Baby , I 'm so scared right now . I know . I 'm gonna be at the hospital by sunrise , then I 'm gonna get you and Sam out . - Okay . - The military is planning to do all these things . I 'm gonna get you both , okay ? Okay . Okay , can you please just hurry . I will . Elle ? I just ... I just want you to know I love you I love you too . Just ... be safe . See you soon . Move out ! As blackouts and electrical interference radiate further and further west , citizens within two hundred miles of the creature 's current sphere of influence are being urged to please find shelter , stay indoors and stay off the roads . 911 , what 's your emergency ? Yes , sir . Yes , warheads are on the move . I completely agree , sir . Alright , people , let 's go . I need to know the exact location of the MUTOs ASAP . Aye , sir . We 're updating our models with their tracking status right now . Admiral . Yes ? Please don 't do this . I understand your concerns , doctor . But I am sacrificing lives every minute just trying to steer one of these things clear of population centers and there are two more of them on the way . There are millions of lives at risk . All I want to know from you is will it work and can they be killed ? But ... We tried that before . We 're talking tolerable yield , megatons not kilotons . Nothing can withstand that blast , makes the bomb we tried to kill it with it in ' 54 look like a firecracker . Sergeant Morales , give me a hand . I thought these nukes all detonated by remote control ? The MUTO 's knocked out everything electric , including detonators . These can 't even range without these things going haywire . But this , this on the other hand , this is old school . Clockwork . Takes a licking , keeps on ticking . Oh , shit . Sergeant Morales , get down here with that radio , on the double ! Move , move ! Snake Eyes , this is Bravo to November . Is the bridge clear ? Over . I say again , we got a train of VIP cargo headed for the coast . Is the bridge clear ? Over . Snake Eyes , I need a ... Are the path clear ? We are in baseline yellow . ... secure or not ? Over . Do you think it 's intact ? Only one way to find out . - Do you want to take the top ? - Sure . You check below . Sergeant Morales , you come with me . Shit ! Jesus . - Jones , are you alright ? - Yeah , I 'm good ! The bridge is intact . Bulldog , this is Eagle . All clear to move out , over . Roger that , Eagle . Let 's go ! Let 's move , people ! Say that again ? I do not have a visual . What is your position ? Over . Unreadable ! Say again , over ! Get down ! Help me turn it off , man . Run ! Move it ! Run ! Ford ! He 's going under . Go ! Sound the collision alarm . Frame one-eight-zero . We 're losing visual , Admiral . He 's diving . Changing course and moving fast , I 've got him at thirty-three knots and picking up speed . It 's gonna out run us , sir . Hey ! Hold on ! Medic ! Wait ! Wait ! These patients are my responsibility ! Where are you taking them ? Across the bridges . Critical and children only . Shelters getting pretty full up fast . Trust me , they 're going to be safer outside the city . - I can take Sam . - No , no . Ford 's on his way . If you change your mind , the buses leave in ten minutes . Where are you , Ford ? Keep it moving ! Let 's go . Come on . Come on . Hey , where are they taking it ? Twenty miles offshore to Burgess Point , we 're going to lure them there . Three birds , one stone . Wait ! Okay , Sammy . Laura , thank god . Sammy , you remember Laura , she 's mommy 's work friend , right ? She 's gonna look after you just for a little bit . Daddy 's gonna be here soon , and I 'm gonna just come get you right after . I promise . Okay . Okay ? Come on , sweetheart . You 're gonna come with me . Your mom 's gonna stay here and help . Elle , I 'm gonna take care of him , okay ? - Say bye-bye mommy . - Bye , mommy . OAKLAND , CALIFORNIA TACTICAL OPERATIONS COMMAND Got him ! I got him ! Sit down here ! Sit , sit ! Did you lose consciousness ? I 'm okay , really . I 'm fine . Sitrep , please . Location of targets ? Male MUTO was spotted thirty miles off the Farallon Islands . We 're showing seismic activity to the east , near Livermore . It should be the female closing in . - Where 's Godzilla ? - Last contact was still five hours ago , maintaining a bearing of zero-five-three degrees and descending below a depth of ten thousand feet . He 'll be here within the hour . There 's still buses on that bridge . You cannot stop bus here . What ? I can 't hear you ! Oh , kids . Please , be quite ! What was that ? Port side , two hundred meters ! Raid ! Hold you fire . Hold your fire . Shoot him ! Come on , come on ! Streets safe , let 's go ! Get out of the way ! Striker , there 's civilians on the bridge ! Hold your fire ! Open fire ! Move it ! Move ! Prepare to arm the device ! Arming keys ! Three , two , one ! What the hell was that ? EMP ! The engine 's stopped ! We lost power ! - You alrigt ? - Yeah . Sam Brody was checked into the Oakland Coliseum shelter an hour ago , he is safe . But I have no record of Elle Brody , she never made it out of the city . Well , check again ! Please ! I told her to wait for me and I didn 't make it . I 'm sorry , but they are trying to get everyone downtown into subway shelters . I 'm sure your wife is fine . Lieutenant Brody ! I 'm looking for Lieutenant Brody ! - Are you Brody ? - Yes . Okay , listen up ! The male delivered the warhead to the center of downtown . That puts a hundred thousand civilians in the blast radius . And we can 't stop it remotely . An analog timer has been installed and the MUTOs are frying electronics within a five mile bubble . It means approaching from ground is not an option . That 's why we 'll be conducting a HALO insertion . Jumping altitude will be thirty thousand feet . Just get it to the top and drop . Here and here . If you don 't hit a skyscraper on the way in , we 'll meet at rally point Charlie . Right here . Good ? Doc , any guesses where to look ? Underground . If the MUTOs have spawned , they 'll be building a nest . Captain , when you find the warhead , how long to disarm it ? Sir , without seeing the analog model , I couldn 't even guess . Sixty seconds if I can access it . I retrofitted that device myself . Lieutenant Brody is our only EOD tech to survive the train attack . Well , it sounds like we could use you . With all due respect , if that doesn 't work , then what 's plan B ? The waterfront is located one click downhill . Get the bomb to the pier , onto a boat , and as far away from the city as possible before it detonates . Any questions ? - Dismissed . - That 's it ! Let 's move ! Lieutenant ? We 've already been briefed , we have no extraction plan . If you don 't walk out , you don 't come back at all . Sir , I 'll do whatever it takes . This alpha predator of yours , doctor , do you really think he has a chance ? The arrogance of man is thinking nature is in our control and not the other way around . Let them fight . Oh , Lord God , we give thanks for the opportunities that you 've given us as we go together as comrades to defend our great nation . We thank you for the time and the service that you 've given us together . And as we are about to leave for another , let us have the strength ... Get into position ! Get into position ! I saw Team One move to the east . Two of our members didn 't make it . I heard bit and pieces on the radio , the snipers are on the roof top and moving in position . Okay , here we go , picking up the nuke . - Which way ? - One click up the hill . Alright , we found the warhead . Let 's go ! Up the hill ! This direction ! Let 's move ! Hey , hey . Watch ! Let 's move ! Let 's move ! On my 6 ! Sarge , take a look at this . We gotta get moving , have you got a signal yet ? Got it . It 's down there . Come on , let 's move ! Well , clear it up . Here we go . Wow , don 't , head 's up ! How much time have we got left ? We 've twenty-seven minutes ! We gotta get this thing down . Careful ! Careful ! On the count of three two , one ! - Let 's get this cover off . - Okay , Lieutenant , you 're up . It 's not budging . It 's sealed shut ! We need time to get this open . We don 't have time ! Let 's haul it out of here ! We gotta get it on a boat ! Everybody , grab the warhead ! Let 's move ! Move it up guys Lieutenant , let 's go ! Lieutenant ? Hurry ! Let 's move ! Let 's move ! What was that ? Shit ! Did you see that ? Run faster ! Run faster ! Let 's get this thing started . Find the ignition , sir ? It 's in the pack . Here you go . Come on . Come on . Hurry ! Hurry it up ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! She 's coming for the bomb ! - Quiet . - Get the weapon secured ! Thousands Still Missing Be quiet ! Quiet ! I hear something ! I hear something ! That 's it , come on ! Grab my hand . We got you . Come on , come on . Mary ! Daddy ! Sam . Mommy ! Sammy . Mommy ! Mommy ! Hey , Sweetie . Hi . Hi , honey . Hi . Oh , dear .

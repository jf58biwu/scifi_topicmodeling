 TARS : Mars , so you name it , and think that you know it . The Red Planet . No air , no life . But you do not know Mars , for its true name is Barsoom . And it is not airless , nor is it dead , but it is dying . The city of Zodanga saw to that . Zodanga , the predator city , moving , devouring , draining Barsoom of energy and life . Only the great city of Helium dared resist , stood strong , matched Zodanga airship for airship , holding fast for a thousand years . Until one day the ruler of Zodanga became cornered in a sandstorm . And everything changed . ( EXPLOSION ) I need clean lights ! Full loft , aye ! ( SCREAMS ) Full loft ! Intensity full ! - Hard turn ! Come about ! - Facing new plot ! No time ! Hard turn now ! ( ALL SHOUTING ) There ! - Shadow ! - Shadow ! ( BATTLE CRY ) Death to Helium ! ( SCREAMING ) Being a fool is a great luxury , Sab Than . Get up . Who ... What are you ? We serve the Goddess . And she has chosen you to receive this weapon . Do as we command and you will rule all of Barsoom . With none to defy you . And nothing to stand in your way . New York City , 1 881 ( PEOPLE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ) - ( LAUGHING BREATHLESSLY ) - Ma 'am . Ten words a minimum . That 's 50 cents , unless you want special delivery . Special delivery it is . Name of sender ? Carter . John Carter . CONDUCTOR : Croton-on-Hudson ! Mr. Burroughs ? I 'm Thompson , Captain Carter 's butler . Sir , I 'm afraid I bring sad tidings . Mr. Burroughs , Noah Dalton , your uncle 's attorney . My deepest sympathies . His death came as a shock to all of us . He was a model of health and vigor . He just dropped dead in his study not five minutes after sending word for me and the doctor . When I arrived he was already gone . The man never stopped digging . All over the world . No soon he started digging one hole than he was off to Java or the Orkney Islands to dig another . He said it was pure research , but it always seemed to me like he was looking for something . Oh , and God grant me he 's found it now . Every inch a cavalry man , to the very end . Mother always said that Jack never really came back from the war . That it was only his body that went west . He used to tell me the most wondrous stories . I 'd like to pay my respects . DALTON : You won 't find a keyhole . Thing only opens from the inside . He insisted . No embalming , an open coffin , no funeral . You don 't acquire the kind of wealth your uncle commanded by being like the rest of us . Come . Let 's go inside . " And lastly , I hereby direct " that my estate shall be held in trust for 25 years , " the income to benefit my beloved nephew , " Edgar Rice Burroughs , " at the end of which term the principal will revert to him . " In full . " Of course I always adored him , but it 's been so long . Why me ? He never offered an explanation , I never asked him for one . It was his private journal . He was most explicit that you , and only you , would read its contents . Now , you might possibly find some kind of explanation in here . I 'll leave you now . Again , my condolences . JOHN : My dear Edgar , I remember how I used to take you on my knee and tell you wild tales , which you always did me the great courtesy of believing . Now you are grown . Time and space have parted us , but I reach out across that distance to that same wide-eyed boy and ask him to believe me once more . This wild tale begins 13 years ago in the Arizona Territory between the Pinale√±o Mountains and the backside of hell . Fort Grant Outpost , 1 868 ( LAUGHTER ) Ah . Coming to load up on spider bait . ( MAN LAUGHS ) No more , Carter . Is there a problem , Mr. Dix ? - Yes , you 're a goddamn loon ! - ( LAUGHTER ) I done took all your money , Carter . Your tab 's $ 1 00 in arrears . I 'll pay . This old Yavapai I met said he 'd seen a cave ... No . Stop ! Not one more word about your cave of gold . MAN 2 : Oh , now , now . Show some respect ! It 's the evil spider cave of gold . ( LAUGHS ) You 're cut off , Carter . Now get on home . MAN 1 : Now , I do believe he done told you to get on out of here . I 'll leave when these bags are full . I found that two days ago up by Bonita . That ought to cover my tab and then some . Beans . The first item is beans . SERGEANT : John Carter ? Your presence is requested up at the fort . I suggest you come peaceably . Do you , now ? ( COUGHS ) You are a difficult man to find , Captain John Carter . First Virginia Cavalry , Army of Northern Virginia , Confederate States of America . I 'm Colonel Powell . Welcome to the 7th Cavalry of the United States ... ( GRUNTS ) Excellent horseman . Fine swordsman . Decorated six times , including the Southern Cross of Honor . At Five Forks , the company under your command nearly turned the tide . ( GRUNTS ) In short , a born fighter . And in the eyes of Uncle Sam , a necessary man for the defense of the Arizona Territory . No . Son , we are up to our chinstraps in Apaches . Ain 't my concern . I believe it is your concern , Captain . Folks are being attacked in their own homes . Slain . You started it . You finish it . You 've gone native , have you ? Apaches can go to hell , too . We 're nothing but a warring species , and I want no part of it . You 're a cavalry man . That makes you valuable to our country and our cause . Colonel Powell , sir , whatever it is you suppose I owe you , our country or any other beloved cause , I have already paid . I have paid in full , sir . So let me tell you what I will do . I will break me out of this cell . I will claim my gold and get filthy rich . Rich enough to buy your flat , righteous blue behind just so I can kick it all day long . ( GROANS ) Captain , I 'm finding it difficult to reconcile the man on this piece of paper with the one I 'm looking at . I suggest you find the horse sense to accept my offer before I give in to my better judgment . Private , the man stays in the bull pit till further notice . Yes , sir ! WOMAN : John ? - ( SCRAPE OF CUTLERY ON PLATE ) - John ? Sleepy-head . Supper 's waiting for you . ( GASPS ) ( URINATING ) Hey , hey , hey ! Hey ! I gave you a bucket . I ain 't going to tell you again . Use the ... - PRIVATE : Colonel Powell ! - Argh ! Colonel Powell ! Sir , he stole your horse . No . Son of a ... Carter ! ( STAMMERING ) That 's Domingo 's band ! Shut your damn mouth , Corporal . ( SPEAKS APACHE ) What 's he saying , Carter ? ( APACHE CONTINUES ) The hell 's he saying now ? What the hell 's he saying , Carter ? - He 's saying ... - ( GUNSHOT ) ( HORSE NEIGHS ) - ( APACHES YELLING ) - ( GUNSHOTS ) Carter ! Agh ! ( SHOOTING CONTINUES ) ( MAN SPEAKS APACHE ) I thought you didn 't care ! I don 't ! ( GRUNTING ) Get up ! Come on . ( GUNSHOT ) Give me a gun . Give me a gun ! I 've got to look . Cover me . The spider . POWELL : This place sure ain 't Apache . JOHN : It sure ain 't . Gold . ( CHUCKLES ) ( GASPS ) Carter ! Right behind you ! ( GRUNTS ) ( YELPS ) Carter ! ( GROANS ) Ock ohem ocktei wies Barsoom . - What ? - Barsoom . Barsoom ? ( GASPS ) ( GRUNTS ) Oh , gee ! ( GRUNTS ) What the ... No , no , no ! ( GRUNTS IN FRUSTRATION ) Wha ...

( SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ) Don 't shoot him ! Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot him ! We should kill it , Jeddak . Move away . ( SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ) Hello . Don 't run . Don 't run away . Hello . Don 't run . Alright . All right . You 've got me . I surrender . Jeddak . - Jeddak ? - Jeddak . Tars Tarkas . Tars Tarkas ? Captain John Carter , Virginia . Vorginia . Vorginia ! No . My name is John Carter . I 'm from Virginia . Virginia . ( SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ) Jump . Jump like you jumped before . ( TRIES TO SPEAK LANGUAGE ) Sack ... Jump , yeah ? Jump . Sack . Jump . Sack . Jump ! Yes , sir . Virginia . Virginia . ( SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ) Don 't ! Don 't shoot him ! Don 't shoot him ! Don 't shoot him ! ( GUNSHOT ) ( CRIES OUT ) What is this place ? Where am I ? ( SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ) lt 's alright , Virginia . Be still . Where 's my damn gold ? ( SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ) Eighteen have yet to hatch , Jeddak . Then they are weak and not Thark . Leave nothing for the white apes . ( SHOOTING ) ( COCK WEAPONS ) - ( SHOOTING CONTINUES ) - JOHN : Where on Earth am I ? Barsoom , a world on the brink . For Zodanga 's new power threatens to destroy our city of Helium . And if Helium falls , so does Barsoom . Rubbish . Goddess , help me , I 'm hopeless . I always come on too strong . Your Highness . My Jeddak . After years of tireless research , I present to you the answer . I hope . ( CLAMOR OF VOICES ) My Jeddak , after years of ... I 'm sorry , Princess . The presentation will have to wait . - Father , what 's happened ? - Dejah ! ( OTHERS CONTINUE TALKING ) I know the terms set by Sab Than . What I want to know is can we afford to reject them ? Admiral Kantos Kan . The eastern border is a wasteland . Sab Than has burned through our defenses , and the border folk will be massacred . Our best troops and fleetest ships are proven less than useless and now comes word that our last remaining squadron has been lost . Helium is lost . My people . I have failed them all . DEJAH : No , my Jeddak , you haven 't ! Forgive me , my lady , but you have not seen this weapon . It radiates the most intense , baleful blue light . When I read our reports on Sab Than 's weapon , I knew . Somehow that idiotic brute had discovered it first . Discovered what ? The Ninth Ray . Unlimited power . Sab Than only uses it for slaughter . But think of what Helium might accomplish with such power . Transform the deserts , restore the seas . Is this what you saw , Kantos ? It 's starting to look very close . Give it time . It will work . ( SCREAMS ) ( NINTH RAY CLATTERS AND POWERS DOWN ) TARDOS : Everyone , leave us . Dejah , ever since you were a little girl , you 've always met the expectations placed on you . It 's Sab 's terms . What are they ? He will spare Helium if you accept his hand in marriage . No ! He is a monster ! You must refuse him ! He 's already on his way here . But all of my work ... I just need a little more time . - Dejah ! - How can you ... You can 't just bow down to Zodanga ! A wedding will save the city . Perhaps , but it could lose you Barsoom . Dejah ! With no one to stop Zodanga , it will be the beginning of the end ! - We do not have the luxury ... - You are the Jeddak of Helium ! You must find another way ! There is no other way ! If there were , I would risk anything to seize it . This is the chance we have been given . Perhaps it is the will of the Goddess . No . It is your will . So , when I was little , and we would look up at the stars and you would tell me of the heroes whose glory was written in the sky , how there was a star up there for me , is this what you imagined would be written on it ? My Jeddak . Sab Than 's corsair approaches the city . They signal for permission to land . Granted . And let us prepare ourselves for a wedding . I have destroyed the device , Matai Shang . She was on the verge of discovery . All is in place . They will consent to the wedding . Keep close watch over her . We don 't want anything to interfere with our next move . ( GROANS ) ( CRYING ) ( SHOUTING ) ( ROARS ) ( SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ) Sarkoja ! Let Sola have a hatchling . ( GROANS ) ( SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ) Sola can take the little white worm . Be still . Let go ! Be still ! What happened to you ? ( SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ) Be still . ( SOLA SHOUTING IN ALIEN LANGUAGE ) ( SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ) Now we kill it . Step away , Tal Hajus . You prize this more highly than my judgment ? Step away . I claim the right of challenge ! And who supports your challenge ? ( BOTH GROWL ) Who will pledge their metal to mine ? ( COMPLETE SILENCE ) ( GRUNTS ) You are blind as a white ape , Tal Hajus . You will not rule today . Not today . See the prize your Jeddak has found ! ls it ... a baby white ape ? No ! It is a rare and valuable animal ! It is called ... lt is called ... Virginia ! ( ALL REPEAT ) Virginia ! ( SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ) Watch . Everyone , step back . Show them , Virginia . Jump . Jump ! ( GRUNTS ) By lssus , you will jump tomorrow , Virginia . Sola , chain him . Tell Sarkoja to initiate him with the other hatchlings . Wait , wait , wait ! ( GROANS ) ( CRYING ) ( COUGHS ) ( SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ) I know. I know ... Drink ... Good ... ( COUGHS ) What 's in that stuff ? ( SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ) The voice of Barsoom . ( SPEAKING BOTH ALIEN LANGUAGE AND ENGLISH ) You can hear it if you choose . ( MASS CRYING ) ( HATCHLINGS CHITTERING ) ( LOW GROWL ) Easy . Nice monster dog . ( GRUNTS ) ( YAWNS ) How the hell did you ... ( BARK ) Quit it ! ( DRUMMING AND CHATTER ) ( LAUGHTER ) ( BARK ) ( BARKING ) ( WHIMPERS ) Stop it ! You killed him with one blow . I ... Wait . I understood you . ( ANGRY VOICES ) What have you done ? Get off ! ( GROWLING ) Get off him ! How did this happen ? Who is to blame ? SOLA : Woola . Do that again and I ... ( GRUNTS ) ( DRUMMING RESUMES AND STOPS AT INTERVALS ) ( CRIES OUT ) Enough ! There is no room for another mark , Sola . Your next offense will be your last . You will jump , Virginia . Now . Jeddak ! Fliers ! You are the stones , the sand ! ( SHOUTING ) Sir , they continue to ignore our signals . Enough ! I 've been patient . I 'll not be mocked . Let them die ! If that 's how you plan to treat your future bride , it 's no wonder she ran from you . Dejah Thoris must live . In range , sir . MATAI : You need only cripple the ship . A pulse to the radium drive will be sufficient . Quick , clean , and precise . Jeddak , shall we destroy her ? No . We need only cripple her . Now bring us around . Zodanga . - Helium . - Helium . Helium . Zodanga . They are the red flag , Helium the blue . Zodanga 's winning the war , but I say let red men kill red men until only Tharks remain . ( CHEERING ) That don 't look like a fair fight . Zodanga never fights fair . Where is she ? My Jeddak , that 's all of them . She can 't have just vanished into thin air . - Check the dead . - We have , sire . Then check them again . ( MEN YELLING ) To the bridge , now ! ( SCREAMING ) ( SCREAMING ) Look out ! ( CHEERING ) ( SCREAMING ) She 's a human ! ( ALL GASP ) Sola ! Who is that ? I bet Virginia . Beg your pardon , ma 'am . If you 'll kindly just stand behind me . This might get dangerous . Or maybe I ought to get behind you . You let me know when it gets dangerous . No . Take him alive . What 's the point of having this thing if I don 't get to use it ? Leave him ! ( GRUNTING ) What are you ? You aren 't red man nor quite white ape ! No matter . You can still bleed like ... Tharks ! Fire ! DEJAH : I surrender . You may take me captive . Prepare to turn about ! ( CHEERING ) ( CHEERING CONTINUES ) Did I not tell you he could jump ? Oh , my God . Let go ! Bad dog ! You are ugly , but you are beautiful . And you fight like a Thark . You lost your wager . You must pay . Jeddak of the Tharks . I am Dejah Thoris , regent of the Royal Helium Academy of Science . - My research vessel ... - Your share of the spoils . Sola ! Tend to Virginia 's property . Yes , my Jeddak ! You know once Sab Than has conquered us , he will turn his weapon upon you ! I know that Zodanga has found a way to defeat you and now you seek a mighty weapon of your own . But Virginia fights for us ! - He 'll fight the Torquas in the south ... - ( CHEERING ) the Warhoon in the north and he will be called Dotar Sojat , - my right arms ! - ( CHEERING ) No . I don 't fight for anyone . Virginia , reject this honor and I cannot guarantee the safety of your red girl . I am Dotar Sojat ! ( CHEERING ) To the plunder ! War is a shameful thing . Not when a noble cause is taken up by those who can make a difference . You made a difference today , Virginia . Okay . See , my name is John Carter . Virginia is where I 'm from . Where did you learn to jump that way ? I don 't know . How 'd you learn to fly ? Your ships cannot sail on light in Virginia ? No , Professor . See , our ships sail the seas . Endless water everywhere . Skeletal structure normal . What are you doing ? Must be the density of your bones . - Jump for me . - SOLA : Enough ! There will be time for playfulness later . I want no playfulness from him . I want his help . Explain to me how you do it . If it 's a skill , teach it to Helium . - Name your price . - I 'm not for hire . I 've got a cave of gold of my own . Somewhere . Only a madman would rave about the time of oceans . Is that your expert view ? - I 'm mad ? - Or a liar . She is a good match for you , Dotar Sojat . Don 't call me that . There are no seas on the planet . You said " planet . " DEJAH : Sun , then Rasoom . JOHN : Mercury . Then Cosoom . Venus . Then Earth ... us . That is Jasoom . You are on Barsoom , John Carter . Mars . I 'm on Mars ? Good God . I 'm on Mars . So , now home is Jasoom and you came on one of your sailing ships across millions of karads of empty space ? No . Not like that . Go on , shock me . How ? That brought me here . Oh . Well , that explains everything , then . - It does ? - Yes . You 're a Thern and you simply wish to return to your rightful place . Isn 't that it ? Yes . Then let 's sort this out right now . Come along ! ( GROWLS ) SOLA : Where are you going ? DEJAH : To your temple . No . No , you cannot enter here . It is forbidden ! You are not Thark ! ( BARK ) Woola , stay ! ( WHISPERS ) Dotar Sojat . It is forbidden . It is forbidden ! Well , you speak for the Goddess . What does she say ? You called me a Thern . Is that what she is ? No , she is Issus . Therns are holy messengers of the Goddess . In the time of oceans , they walked among us , guiding us . We must not offend . Let us go . There 's some kind of writing up there . ( DEJAH SHRIEKS ) ( JOHN GROANS ) ( PRAYS ) - Can you read it ? - It 's old scripture . There it is again . - What 's it mean ? - Don 't rush me . " Those who seek the solace of eternity " may journey down the river " through the sacred Gates of Iss " and find everlasting peace " in the bosom of Issus . " JOHN : The Gates of Iss . What if I could take you there ? What if I didn 't trust you ? Then we 'd be even . I can take you to the Gates , to the answers that you seek . A way back to Jasoom . - Earth . - Earth . It 's the least I could do to repay you for getting us out of here . Assuming that you can . Deal . Go on . You shake it . As a sign of trust . Good enough . Now all I need to do is get this medallion off Tars Tarkas . Dotar Sojat ? ( WEAPON IS COCKED ) Useless she-calot . ( WEAPONS ARE COCKED ) I told you . It is forbidden . ( GROANING ) ( GRUNTS ) What in the name of Issus is going on ? Issus has been profaned . We found this one and the red wench plotting in the temple . In the temple ? How did they get ... Sola led them there . Sola tried to stop us . I meant no disrespect to your goddess , Tars . I 'm just trying to get home . Your right arms were planning to rob you of the medallion and use it to commit greater blasphemy down the River Iss . They must all die in the arena . How could you do this ? I spared your life . I made you Dotar Sojat yet her life means nothing to you . You knew ... You knew she had no room for another mark . Now Sola will die because of you . She 's your daughter , isn 't she ? ( GRUNTS ) Who told you that ? Call it a father 's intuition . A Thark has no parent but the horde . But how do you know ? Her mother kept her egg and Sola 's the last flicker of her ancient greatness . You can 't just stand here and let her be killed . Argh ! My right arms offend me . I will cut them off . No . You must hurry . I mean to release you . I make one condition . You take Sola with you down the River Iss . My Jeddak . I 'd rather you died in the arms of the Goddess than as food for wild banths in the arena . Where you go , she goes . What 's gonna happen to you , Tars ? Leave a Thark his head and one hand and he may yet conquer . Is it done , my Jeddak ? Tars Tarkas betrays us . JOHN : Woola ! You belong to him . Woola would follow you anywhere on Barsoom . DEJAH : It 's three days ' ride . Follow me . JOHN : What happened to this place ? DEJAH : Zodanga happened . Sailing on light . Still playing the madman ? Or the liar . DEJAH : Keep moving ! We 'll get there ! SAB THAN : Why pursue this wedding any longer ? I 've already won . Not yet . You must aim past the horizon , Sab Than . To truly demoralize a nation requires a public spectacle on the grandest scale . Staging this wedding will ensure your rule goes unchallenged . If you insist . If you cannot see the wisdom in that , then we will find another who can . Dotar Sojat . Carter ! I do not think she leads us to the Iss . All right , then , Sola . Just play along . ( GASPS ) What do you think I 'd do once I saw your city and not some river ? - What do you mean ? - Cluros and Thuria . They should be at our backs by now . You lead us toward Helium ! Once we reach there , you would see for yourself the virtue of our cause . ( SCOFFS ) Everyone thinks their cause is virtuous ... Professor . DEJAH : What are you doing ? ( GRUNTS ) No ! John Carter ! You can 't ! I like this plan better . Just wait . She 'll come around . You mad fool ! You 're not from Earth ! There are no Therns ! I only told you what you wanted to hear so you 'd get us out ! Stop ! I can 't ! I cannot marry him ! Can 't marry who ? The Zodangan Jeddak you fought . Sab Than . He offered a truce to my father in exchange for my hand . Your father ? Tardos Mors . The Jeddak of Helium . She is a princess ! A princess of Mars . How about that ? A princess who didn 't want to get married , so she ran away . No . Is that all there is to the story ? No , I didn 't run away ! - I escaped ! - From what , his breath ? So marry the guy and save your people . A life of oppression ! That 's not living ! If you had the means to save others , would you not take any action possible to make it so ? No good will come out of me fighting your war . I would lay down my life for Helium . Yes , I ran away . I was afraid , weak . Maybe I should have married . But I so feared that it would somehow be the end of Barsoom . I tell you truly , John Carter of Earth , there are no Gates of Iss . They are not real . I 'm sorry , Princess . But this , this is real . And so is my cave of gold . Prudence demands you take an escort . No . I go alone , General . But , Jeddak ... In one sweep , I can put an end to 1 , 000 years of civil war and bring Helium to its knees forever . But my general , in his superior wisdom , objects . Is that right ? I 'm starting to talk like you . THERN 1 : Hekkador , they have reached the lss . It took them longer than I thought . THERN 2 : If they reach the Gates ... THERN 3 : They can breach the sanctuary . THERN 4 : Her knowledge of the Ninth Ray is already ... MATAI : As advanced as it will ever be . Patience , brothers . It is under my control . I 'm already there . SOLA : The Iss . Here , pilgrims must leave behind all they have , all they know , never to return . May the Goddess find me worthy . Wait ! What do you think you 're doing ? It is my way , Dotar Sojat , not yours . I must honor my Jeddak and redeem my unworthiness ! You want to honor your father ? Then stay alive and help me . ( GASPS ) My father ? Sola ... Why would you say that ? That 's what drives your compassion , the blood of your father , Tars Tarkas . And of all the Tharks , you 're the only one worthy of him . Your duty to your father demands that you see me through . Just help me find the Gates . Then you can decide what honor requires . Just to the Gates , then . Woola , stay ! ( WOOLA WHINES ) ( LOW VOICES ) Other pilgrims . Professor . ( RECITES PRAYER ) Impossible . I 've never seen this kind of structure before . JOHN : I want to get a better look . ( GASPS ) Carter , your feet . ( RUMBLING AND CRACKING ) ( LOW GROWL ) This is not the work of gods . These are machines . Your medallion . A spider . Nine . Nine rays . Nine . The Ninth Ray is real . It can be harnessed . Do you see ? This entire structure runs on Ninth Ray isolates . Mother Issus ! Such power . And somehow Zodanga has it . The Therns . They must be real . And you are John Carter of Earth ? Yes , ma 'am . And the ships that sail on the sea . You 've seen them . That must be a beautiful sight . It truly is . ( GASPS ) It 's our solar system . - What 's it say ? - I 'm not sure . What do you think it says ? It appears to be a kind of technical diagram . Here is Barsoom . There is Jasoom . This glyph here , it 's like our symbol for a transcription , a copy , sent along these lines here , between the worlds . Like ... A telegram . You 're saying I was telegraphed here . I 'm a copy of myself . Possibly , making these words here the command for travel . I don 't like guessing . I need more information . I need charts , codices . Right . And where might we find those ? In the Hall of Science . And where 's that ? Helium . Then quick , let 's just head on and turn on back to Helium . What do you take me for ? I take you for a man who 's lost . I won 't be lost if you just tell me how to work this thing ! I will ! But everything I need to understand that medallion is in Helium . I 'm trying to get you back to your cave of gold . Isn 't that what you want ? Yes . No . I don 't believe you . We may have been born worlds apart , but I know you , John Carter . From the moment you caught me in the sky , I knew . I felt the heart of a man willing to lay down his life for others , a man willing to fight for a cause . Here . On Barsoom . Don 't you see , Carter ? I fled to find another way . You are the other way . ( LOUD CRASHING ) SOLA : Dotar Sojat ! SOLA : Warhoon ! ( YELLS ) ( GRUNTS ) Dotar Sojat ! Pursue them to the Aoolian Plain . Then overtake them and capture the red woman alive . The one who jumps ? Let 's see what he 's capable of . ( MIGHTY ROAR ) ( GRUNTING ) ( SPURRING ) Sarah ! - Whoa ! - Dotar Sojat ! - What are you doing ? - Sola , get her out of here . ( SCREAMS ) Carter ! I was too late once . I won 't be again . No ! No ! ( SCREAMS ) No ! No ! Woola , go . Go , damn you ! ( YELLS ) ( SCREECHING ) Father ! Thank the Goddess ! Carter . Oh , thank Issus . TARDOS : Who is he ? His name 's John Carter . He saved my life . He 's from Jasoom . ( SHOCKED MURMURS ) Jasoom ! Zodanga 's closer . He 'll have my personal physician . He shot me out of the sky ! Daughter , listen to me ! Listen . Sab has admitted to everything . He came to me , alone , without an escort . I could have had him imprisoned . I could have had him killed . Yet , it was clear he only cared about your safety . I feared you 'd be tortured by the Tharks and condemned to die in their arena . I could not live with that on my conscience . I do have one , Princess . Really ? I thought you had it removed along with ... She does not trust me , Jeddak . And why should she ? There 's never been trust between Zodanga and Helium . Therefore , Princess , I offer you this small but sincere token of my goodwill . My life . ( YELLS ) You hold the power , Princess . The power of life over me and over all Barsoom . With our two cities united , anything is possible . All you have to do is marry me . Is this Helium ? ( SCOFFS ) No . ( GRUNTS ) Ah , Zodanga , where the men are as limited as the menu and the women are as hard as the beds . What 's your business here ? He is my business . The Jasoomian is to be taken to more secure accommodation . We 've received no such orders ! You 're receiving them now ! Straight from the laughing lips of Sab Than himself . I hear that you are incredibly dangerous . ( LOW VOICE ) Take me hostage . - What ? - Take me hostage . Are you all right ? ( SIGHS ) No ! The white imbecile has taken my sword ! Guards ! Carter ! Run ! There 's a crazy man running amok with a sword ! Carter , this way ! Right , your turn . - My turn ? - Yeah . - Who are you ? - My name is Kantos Kan . I serve Princess Dejah . - Dejah ? - Uh-huh . And from what she tells me , you can get us over there . She said I could make that ? We could always surrender . Quickly ! Is that what you do on Jasoom ? Come on ! ( GRUNTS ) ( WOMEN SCREAM ) Hello , ladies . ( GIGGLING ) You are expected to bow in my presence , Captain Carter . Bow . I suppose that will do . I fetched him , as you commanded . Thank you , Kantos . I wish to speak to Captain Carter alone . Keep watch outside . Now , girls . Off you go ! ( DOOR SHUTS ) You look beautiful . It 's traditional Zodangan , worn by the groom 's mother , I 'm told . A little vulgar for my taste , but my opinions are about to become irrelevant . You can 't seriously be considering this . - What other choice do I have ? - Don 't marry him . Give me a reason not to . Will you stay and fight for Helium ? Dejah . We have a saying on Barsoom . A warrior may change his metal , but not his heart . You were right . I could decipher the command . It 's a set of sounds . A simple phrase . Repeat after me . Ock , ohem , ocktei ... SAB THAN : Open the door ! Say it now . Ock , ohem , ocktei . - ( HAMMERING AT DOOR ) - SAB THAN : Are you all right , Dejah ? Ock , ohem , ocktei . Wies . - Wies . - Jasoom . Jasoom . Say it . - Say it . Say it ! - Ja ... Dejah ? Are you alone ? Yes . I am alone . Well , my Jeddak . The moons will soon be rising . Let us not delay the proceedings any further . Yes . Yes , of course . Ssh . We 'll have plenty of time to talk . Now . ( GROANS ) Who are you ? - American . - Who are you , sir ? " Sir . " Definitely the South . The Carolinas ? Virginia ? It 's Virginia , isn 't it ? - Lovely place . - Do you know it ? Not as well as I should . But I will . Padwar , what 's the hold-up ? Sorry , sir . The streets are blocked . It 's the wedding procession . Increased strength and agility . Simple matter of gravitation and anatomy , one we ought to have foreseen . We ? No apparent increase in intelligence . Still , this will not do at all . We can 't have Earthmen projecting themselves over here , leaping about , causing all manner of disruption . You 're a Thern . Therns are a myth . Padwar , we 'll go on foot . Yes , sir . My name is Matai Shang , and I do not exist . Indeed , I work very hard at it . ( CLAMORING ) Excuse me , excuse me . Many pardons , many pardons . It 's a shame , really . She 's a remarkable creature , and she came very close indeed . You mean the Ninth Ray . It 's of no consequence now . After tonight 's ceremony , when the two moons meet and vows are exchanged , she and anyone else with knowledge of the Ninth Ray will be eliminated . In effect , cutting the head off the beast . Quick , clean and precise . ( GASPS ) Shame there 's no one to warn her . ( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) The balance must be restored . ( GASPS ) What gives you the right to interfere ? What do you care ? This is not your home . You have no obligation to these people . You don 't have a dog in this fight . Is that how you would say it in Virginia ? Man without a cause . So what is your cause ? We have none . We 're not haunted by mortality as you are . We are eternal . I don 't understand . The wedding , this little stroll . Why not just kill me , kill Dejah ? History will follow the course we have set , Earthman . And we 've chosen Sab Than to rule next . The Ninth Ray must remain in the hands of mindless brutes we can control . And the infamy of Dejah Thoris 's wedding death will seal his reign . We 've been playing this game since before the birth of this planet . And we 'll continue to do so , long after the death of yours . We don 't cause the destruction of a world , Captain Carter . We simply manage it , feed off it , if you like . But on every host planet , it always plays out exactly the same way . Populations rise , societies divide , wars spread . And all the while the neglected planet slowly fades . Prep a two-man flier immediately for prisoner transport . Yes , sir . Argh ! Immortal ain 't bulletproof . I shot one of you back on Earth . Oh , come on . I 'm trying ! I 'm trying ! Guards ! After him ! ( SCREAMING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GROANS ) Ohh , Woola ! I told you Woola would follow you anywhere . He did a lot more than just that . Wait ! Wait ! Where are you going ? To save Dejah . And I 'll need an army to do it . Get on . No ! Tharks do not fly . ( APPROACHING WHINE ) ( GRUNTS ) Gayor . Tars ! They 're going to kill Dejah . Issus truly rewards the just . ( GRUNTS ) ( YELLS ) ( CHUCKLES ) - I see the dead . - Tars ? The Virginia I knew traveled the Iss . What have they done to you ? Tal challenged . I lost . Virginia . When I saw you leap into the sky , I wished to believe it was a sign that something new can come into this world , that the greatness of our Thark race might rise again . But it is too late . ( COUGHS AND SPLUTTERS ) - Tars . - No matter . My daughter is with her mother in Paradise . There is comfort in that . Tars , it 's Sola . Actually , she 's here with me . Argh ! ( GROANS ) This is how you repay your debt to me ? I need my sword . Then it would harvest your thoughtless head from your body ! ( GRUNTING AND STRAINING ) ( EXHAUSTED SIGH ) ( COUGHS AND SPLUTTERS ) Up now ! We go ! It is done . Nonsense . " Leave a Thark his head and one hand , and he may yet conquer . " Right ? Your spirit annoys me . ( MIGHTY ROAR FROM CROWD ) JOHN : All this your work ? Banths . Weakness . Sentiment . Allowing this white worm to contaminate the horde . These are the crimes of Tars Tarkas . We are united because we cull our freaks . We are strong because we despise weakness . ( MUTTERS OF AGREEMENT ) Let them be crushed like unhatched eggs . ( CHEERING ) ( GRUNTS AND STRAINS ) ( BELLOWING ) JOHN : Is that a banth ? No . It is a white ape . ( SCREECHES ) - ( CROWD CHEERS ) - Run ! ( SNIFFING ) Tars ! Get up ! Tars ! Give me your hand ! You have four damn hands ! Give me one ! - Father ! - Father ? JOHN : Tars ! Tars ! Hey ! ( CROWD ROARS ) Hey ! Hey , over here , you blind monkey ! ( GRUNTS ) ( STRAINING ) Release the other one . ( CROWD ROARS ENTHUSIASTICALLY ) ( SIGHS ) Watch your father die like the whimpering calot he is ! ( CROWD CHANTING ) No ! Let us watch you ! ( SCREAMS ) ( RIPPING ) Sola ! Are you mad ? No . The blood of my father drives me . ( GRUNTS ) ( YELLS ) ( CROWD CHEERS AND WHOOPS ) ( GRUNTING AND STRAINING ) ( YELLS ) ( SNARLS ) ( CROWD ROARS ) Sola ! ( CROWD GASPS ) ( CHEERING ) ( CHANTING ) Virginia ! Virginia ! Virginia ! Virginia ! I claim the right of challenge ! ( GRUNTS INQUISITIVELY ) You have no right to challenge ! You are not Thark ! He is Thark ! He is Dotar Sojat ! ( CHANTS ) Dotar Sojat ! Dotar Sojat ! ( CROWD CHANTS ) Dotar Sojat ! Dotar Sojat ! ( CHANT INCREASES IN PACE ) Who will pledge their metal to mine ? ( YELLS ) ( WILD CHEERING ) The Jeddak of Zodanga means to crush Helium this very night . And if Helium falls , so does Barsoom . We must throw off the yoke of old hatreds . Tharks did not cause this . But , by Issus , Tharks will end it ! ( ENTHUSIASTIC CHEERING ) We ride for Zodanga ! I know that this is not the fate you would have chosen for yourself , or for Helium , but choice is a luxury even for a Jeddak of Barsoom . Even if , in your heart ... A heart is a luxury . MATAI : Steady . Remember , she is not the prize . The prize is Barsoom . ( ROAR OF BATTLE CRIES ) SOLA : You ! Why is Zodanga undefended ? Where is everyone ? The army has been repositioned outside Helium . Only a small contingent remains . Sab and Dejah Thoris . Where are they ? They 're at the wedding in Helium ! Helium ? TARS : No ! I have made my decision . It 's the only way to get there in time . Tharks do not fly . So be it . This is madness , Dotar Sojat . You 'll die ! Then I 'll see you down the River Iss . Follow the canal ! Be careful ! The moonlight will force you to fly low ! ( BARKING ) ( GRUNTS IN FRUSTRATION ) Like our ancestors before us , we gather under the mingled light of Barsoom 's first lovers , Cluros and Thuria . As the moons are joined in celestial union , so do we unite Sab Than and Dejah Thoris , Zodanga and Helium . ( COCKS WEAPON ) No ! You 'll raise the alarm . It 's one of ours . In the time of oceans , the celestial lovers rose from the sea each night to consummate their love in the sky . Drink now of this holy water and be wed . So may it be again . I am yours forever . And I am yours forever . Carter ! It 's a trap ! Zodanga 's at your walls ! Now ! Do it now ! - No ! - Helium falls ! ( SCREAMING ) Zodanga ! ( GRUNTS ) Dejah ! Argh ! ( SCREAMING ) If you 'll just get behind me , sir . ( YELLS ) Carter ! ( YELLS ) - It was such a nice wedding . - Yeah , that . Helium 's fate is sealed , Earthman . As is yours . ( PANICKED CRIES ) Thank the Goddess that 's over with . ( BATTLE CRIES ) ( GROANS ) Virginia ! It is good to fly ! By Issus , they fight with us ! KANTOS : Brother ! Heliumite , huh ? You 're going to tell me everything you know about the Therns . You spare me and I 'll tell you . ( CHOKING ) ( GASPS ) A fitting solution for your setback , wouldn 't you say , Captain ? Dejah Thoris survives her assassins but will fail to prove her misguided theory of the Ninth Ray . Yes . I 'll enjoy playing that out . DEJAH : Carter ! Dejah ! I 'm getting away ! Tars . The medallion . Give it to me , my Jeddak . No ! ( YELLS ) I 'll explain later . TARS : You have won , my Jeddak . All is finished . Not quite . A Jeddak . I see you have changed your metal . And my heart . Dejah Thoris , would a princess of Mars ever consider marriage to a wayward Virginia cavalryman with nothing to offer ? Yes , John Carter . Yes ! TARDOS : By the ancient rite of moons and water are you bound together , husband and wife . ( CHEERING ) John ? Homesick for the Thark nursery ? I 'm sorry . I couldn 't sleep . I had that feeling you get , suddenly , that you left a light burning or a door open . Go back to bed . I won 't be long . Be back in one xat , John Carter of Earth . Come . John Carter of Earth . Yup . John Carter of Mars sounds much better . Sire , I must express the deepest of gratitude for saving Helium . Please . The honor is mine . Fair enough , Earthman . Now it 's your move . Ock ohem ocktei wies Jasoom . ( CLOTHING CRACKLES ) ( GROANING AND PANTING ) No , no . No . Powell ? No ! ( CRIES OUT ) Ock ohem ocktei wies Barsoom . Bars ... Barsoom . 50 million miles apart and no way to bridge the gap . No way to return my body and my soul to their true home . Like a fool , I had thrown away my medallion . Then I recalled Matai Shang . His knowledge of Earth , of my history . It meant Therns were a presence on this world . The cave in Arizona was proof . There might be other such proofs , other Thern way stations hidden all around the world . I knew now what the cave of gold must be used for . So for ten bitter years , I searched . On the trail of rumor and legend l ferreted out every possible evidence of the Therns , but I found no medallion . And then it came to me . MAN : ( SHOUTS AND WHOOPS EXCITEDLY ) I 've got it ! I 've found it ! ( EXCITED CHATTER ) JOHN : And once it came , there were many plans I had to make in secret . I could trust no one else . I had long suspected that the Therns were following my movements . Sir . I feel remarkably unwell , Thompson . - Please send for the doctor . - Yes , sir . And , Thompson ... My attorney as well . Of course , sir . Now you will understand the cause of my sudden death . The reason for my bizarre funeral instructions . Why the door can only be opened from the inside . For if my body dies on Earth , then my copy dies on Mars . You are the key . This is the task I entrust to you along with all my fortune . Protect my body . The Therns will attempt to destroy it . ln the time it has taken you to read these pages , they may have already done so . ( PANTING ) I am the key . I am the key . I , Edgar . Ed ... Ed ... E ... D ... Ed ! It should work ! Dear Ned . You sneaky devil ! You never called me Edgar ! You ... You called me Ned ! - ( GUNSHOT ) - ( GASPS ) Hello , Ned . Toxin . Derived from the puffer fish . Simulates death . You never found the medallion . No . That 's why I 'm so grateful to you for bringing me one . I ... I was just bait ? No . You 're far more than that . I really do need a protector . That is , if you 're willing . Goodbye , Ned . Oh , and , Ned ... Take up a cause . Fall in love . Write a book . It 's time I went home . Ock ohem ocktei wies ...

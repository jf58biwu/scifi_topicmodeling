 Coulson : Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... [ flatline ] May : You saved Skye 's life . - What is it ? - Why aren 't you happy about it ? Coulson : Being down there ... seeing where I came from ... I just got really scared that she would suffer the way that I did . May : Agent Ward and I have been having sex . - Coulson : And if it 's a problem ... - I 'll end it . 1x15 - Yes Men [ indistinct conversations ] [ music ] Jimmy : I got to grab something real quick . I 'll be right back , my love . Rooster : Get a look at that . H-hey , darlin ' , gal like you could have any man you want . Why did you marry that little dude ? He loaded ? He 's not my husband . I took him from his bride earlier today . I needed him to provide safe passage . You in trouble ? 'Cause if you need a place to lay low for awhile , this is as good as any . [ engine turns over ] Oh ! What kind of beast is that ? [ gasps ] It 's a 1987 heritage softail . You can hop on mine , you want to feel a roar . How grand . - What is your name ? - My men , they call me Rooster . You have men ? You are their leader ? [ chuckles ] Last time I checked , yeah . [ wind blows ] [ twinkling ] [ distorted ] You and your men now serve me . This guy bothering you ? [ normal voice ] No . He 's with me now . What ? No ! I 'm with you ! You said we 'd be together forever , remember ? I said we 'd be together till the end . It is the end . Aagh ! [ men murmuring ] - Who are you ? - I 'm Lorelei . Now introduce me to all of my men . [ knock on window ] No ! What did I say ? [ sighs ] Damn it . Every time . It 's like you have a sensor - for whenever my butt lifts off the bed . - Back in it . - I just want to stretch my legs . - Now . Look ! There 's color in my cheeks . Breathing without ... [ strained ] ... feeling like my whole body 's on fire . I 'm good . [ chuckles ] " Good " is not the appropriate word to describe your state . You 've been shot twice , had your stomach perforated , and a breathing tube shoved down your throat . " Better " is the more accurate word . Again with the blood drive ? I 'm not gonna have anything left . [ chuckles ] Not sure how I feel about Dr. Simmons . She 's so strict . Ow . And pokey . Well , patient Skye is unruly and stubborn . [ sighs ] And grateful . - I hope you know that . - I didn 't do it alone . Still , I 'm the most ... " grateful-est-est " patient alive . [ chuckles ] That 's not even a word . Hey . This a bad time ? [ grunts ] It is if you 're here to bust me out . [ as Simmons ] The Warden has extended house arrest . [ scoffs ] Terrible accent . [ normal voice ] [ groans ] I must look terrible ! [ chuckles ] [ sighs ] Simmons won 't even bring me a mirror . - I 've seen worse . - Wow . Thanks . No , I mean , you look better than when you were dying . Swinging and a-missing , Ward . [ sighs ] It 's great to see you ... better . It was so stupid to go in there alone . Hey . There 's no point in doing that now . You were brave . Thanks to you , every S.H.I.E.L.D. agent in the country knows Mike Peterson 's alive . - It 's all about his magic leg ? - I didn 't call it that , but yes . Agent Garrett 's running point on Mike . Thinks he 's part of some project called Deathlok . He looked like death . You should have ... He wouldn 't even look at me . They did something to him . He needs help . He 's past help . He was there with you , Skye ... could have protected you . He let this happen to you . And I 'll never forgive that . Well , I-I need to better protect myself , so ... when Simmons gives the all-clear , we 'll start training ? - We 'll ease you back into it . - No . I want to train harder . Next time , I don 't want to depend on some miracle drug to save me . She 's beginning to get suspicious of all the blood I 'm taking . Fitz : No wonder . How many samples have you tested each day ? Not enough . Not enough to find anything in her blood or Coulson 's . [ sighs ] There isn 't ample residue remaining in the vial to examine after we emptied it into her bloodstream . Such a pity we only found the one . Well , excuse me for not sticking around long enough to get blown to pieces . [ sighs ] It 's just that the last sample of this miracle drug is inside Skye . - You can 't find any trace of it ? - No . She 's healing at an exponential rate , but I can 't detect anything irregular on a cellular level . And you 've explained to Coulson that you need to upload the samples to H.Q. ? He shut me down , said to keep it in-house . [ scoffs ] I mean , this drug could be a phenomenal breakthrough , could save countless lives . Why is he being so twitchy ? Well , you were down in the bunker with him . Did you see anything peculiar ? Everything was peculiar . Director Fury moved heaven and Earth . [ flatline ] No ! Don 't give it to her ! [ monitor beeping ] [ engine revs ] [ tires squeal ] You know , usually , when a friend wants a favor , they do something nice ... takes me to a nice restaurant , buys me a bottle of wine . Want to go to a movie , hold hands ? Okay . But I need to ask you a question first . I don 't know where Director Fury is . Don 't be so shocked . For a quiet guy , you make a lot of noise . How many favors have you called in ? Clearly , not enough . Something I can help you with ? Fine . But Fury is a high-level agent who 's off-grid . You don 't find him unless he wants to find you . You did something like that once , too . Remember ? I never asked you . - How was Tahiti ? - It sucked . [ engine turns over ] New orders . S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s detecting massive energy readings in the skies above the California / Nevada border . - Wade : Where 's Agent Coulson ? - Taking personal time . That 's a couple days straight . Simmons : These are the same readings Dr. Selvig and Dr. Foster picked up in New Mexico and in London . They herald the arrival of an Asgardian . - Thor . - Not sure . Either way , S.H.I.E.L.D. wants us to be the welcome wagon . O-okay . Fine . No cause for concern , right ? - Asgardians are allies . - Loki wasn 't . [ sighs ] [ sirens wailing ] Fitz ? Fitz : Yeah , we 're definitely getting close , but it 's a bit of a crap shoot . This is still science we don 't completely understand . Seems to be a lot of that going around lately . So , Coulson hasn 't talked to you about why he changed his mind on giving Skye that injection ? No . He 's keeping it to himself . Whoa . I 'm getting a massive energy surge , - three times the level of the one before . - How close ? [ thunder crashes ] [ tires screech ] [ thunder crashing ] - Yeah , definitely Asgardian . - Running facial recognition . [ beeping ] Okay , got it . I don 't have a name , but I can confirm she was in New Mexico , fighting with Thor and his mates . She 's on our side . May : Stand down . She 's a friendly . - You are of S.H.I.E.L.D. ? - Yeah ? I am Lady Sif of Asgard . Your world is in grave danger . She 's a warrior . I saw her fight in New Mexico with Thor ... climbed a giant metal killing machine , speared it with her double-bladed sword . It was pretty badass . She says she needs S.H.I.E.L.D. to help her find someone . - You up for this ? - I 'm fine . " Fine " doesn 't look like this . Not on you . You 've been gone more often than not . Whatever 's bothering you ... I 'm here . I know . What dark magic is this ? Thor said you perished at the hand of Loki . And he was right ... for awhile , anyway . But Loki wasn 't the only one with some tricks up his sleeve . Turns out , S.H.I.E.L.D. had a few of their own . Thor will be pleased to hear it . - He considers you a friend . - I feel the same , which is why I 'd prefer he hear it from me , if that 's okay . I understand you 're looking for someone . I am hunting her . Lorelei . 600 years ago , she used her powers to wreak havoc across the nine realms , to command armies , bring down kings , empires . What kind of powers we talking about ? - Strength ? Speed ? - Sorcery . She bends and shapes the will of men to her own purpose . May : Only men ? Her powers don 't work on women ? No . Men have an inherent weakness we do not share . I can 't imagine what she 's talking about . The very sound of her voice can ensnare most . For the rare man who can resist , it 's her voice joined by her touch that will overpower his will . Coulson : So , how do we stop her ? With this . It prevents her from speaking . She wore one like it for centuries while locked in prison . She escaped when the dark elves invaded Asgard and came here using one of Loki 's secret pathways between worlds . Do we know where she is now ? All I know is the bifrost delivered me to her last known location . Mostly small towns out that way . Let 's start looking for unusual activity within a few-hundred-mile radius ... burglary , theft , assault . If this woman 's used to ruling over empires ... she 's gonna be hard to please . Lorelei : I wanted gold ! You bring me ... paper ? ! It 's ... it 's cash . It 's like gold . - This is the currency here . - And who 's this ugly woman ? Uh , that 's ... uh , that 's Ben Franklin . Used to be President . Used to rule this whole country . Hmm . And women can rule your land , can they not ? Well , uh , y-you 'd be the first . Yes . I will . What the hell , Duane ? ! - Whoa , whoa , whoa . - Move ! Move ! I have been texting you all day , worried sick ! I thought you were dead in a gutter somewhere . Don 't , baby . There 's nothing to worry about . [ sighs ] I-I just turned off my cellphone 'cause the noise was bothering Lorelei . Are those my clothes ? Why is this woman wearing my clothes , Duane ? Who 's this Duane she speaks of ? It 's , uh ... that 's me . My ... my real name 's Duane . She calls me that . She 's my wife . - Yeah . - Oh ! Do you prefer her to me ? Sh-she is nobody next to you . Nobody ? ! Really ? ! " Nobody " owns this bar . You know what ? Everybody out . Out ! We are closed ! Out ! I 'm tired of this noise , Rooster . Make it stop . His name is not Rooster ! It 's ... I 'm sorry , baby . [ gagging ] You 're just making too much noise . [ thud ] These are files of every police report within 100 miles of where you arrived , everything from the last 48 hours . When you want to sift through the information , you just ... - I 'm familiar . - ... touch the ... oh . It 's an antiquated system we and other realms had ages ago . [ sighs ] You 've ... visited other realms , seen different species , aliens . Have you ever encountered any that were ... blue ? - Yes , of course . - Which ones ? Uh , Interdites , Levians , Pheragots , Kree , Sarks , Centaurians . The Frost giants tried to conquer your Earth a millennia ago , but Asgard drove them away . Oh . Well , thanks for that . And the others ... have any of them been here recently ? [ sighs ] Rest easy , Phillip , Son of Coul . None of the others have ever visited Earth . [ beeping ] There ... a robbery of jewels . And there ... a gun-store robbery by guys on Harleys . It 's happening faster than I feared . She 's amassing men , gold , weaponry . Lorelei is building an army . Traced the men to a biker bar called Rosie 's desert oasis . Probably where Lorelei 's hiding out . Meeting a S.H.I.E.L.D. convoy there in 10 . Fitz : Good . Then you can show off these beauties . [ whistles ] - These all night-night guns ? - Based on the same technology , but we 're not calling them that anymore . - About time . - They 're called ICERs ... - incapacitating cartridge emitting ... - [ gun cocks ] They 're great . And you lost the ounce . And I tripled the stopping power . But I did realize after our run-ins with Mike and Centipede ... - Whoa . - Sorry . ... um , that we needed something stronger , better . Thought you didn 't like guns . No , I always say if I need a gun , I 'll take one . - Ah . - We 'll need these . When you 're up against people who are being controlled , sometimes it 's hard to distinguish friend from foe . - This way , we can take out either . - Where 's Lady Sif ? [ clank ] Shall we ? Lorelei 's tastes run toward palaces , castles . This is far more humble than her usual abode . The draw wasn 't the place . It was the manpower . How many men does she have in there ? Have you seen the suspect ? Yes , we have . And she 's beautiful . [ gunshots ] [ sighs ] What is that ? Well , it seems we 've caught the attention of the law . - You swore to fight for me . - Yeah , and I will . But they got a lot of firepower out there . I mean , hell , they even got some medieval-times chick . She 's got , like , a sword and everything ! Sif . [ bullet ricochets ] [ gunfire ] They 're on us from both sides . Be hard to get off a clean shot . Your ladyship , can you give us a little cover ? [ grunts ] Very literal interpretation . Thank you . - All clear . - Men , stay outside . Let Sif take Lorelei . Ward , head around back . Surround the building . [ door opens ] Lorelei ... still manipulating men to do your dirty work , I see . And I see you 're still a step or two behind . You know how this ends , Lorelei . So come willingly . You mistake me for someone who fears you . I 've bested you before . Or have you forgotten ? Tear her apart . [ bullet ricochets ] [ grunts ] [ screams ] [ glass shatters ] Look . [ sighs ] I 'm sure you 're , uh , a reasonable guy ... [ grunts ] ... Rooster . Rooster ? Really ? [ breathing heavily ] - You 're a fine warrior . - I am . So put your hands behind your back and get on your knees . [ wind blows , twinkling ] [ distorted ] Men kneel before me . I do not bow to them . Gonna need some backup over here . That is not what you need . [ engine revs ] Take me somewhere grand , deserving of a ruler , - a queen . - I know just the place . [ grunts ] Lorelei 's treachery remains unchanged , no matter the world . We 'll find them . Every agent in the area is out looking . To what end , hmm ? The collar ... has been broken . Short of death , we have no means to end her enchantment . Let me worry about that . Stay here . And try not to punch a hole in my airplane . So , Ward 's what ? Like , a pod person ? No , according to Lady Sif , the men Lorelei controls don 't forget who they are or what they know . She just becomes the embodiment of all their desires . So once we find them , we can break her mojo or whatever and get Ward back , right ? Yes , once the collar 's back on Lorelei 's neck , the enchantment ends , but that 's the problem . The collar caught a shotgun blast back in the desert . - You think you can fix it ? - Well ... the metal , the weight ... it 's similar to the Berserker staff . But it presents its own set of countless unknown variables . - Got a couple hours . - Yeah . [ grunts ] What can I do ? And don 't you dare say nothing or tell me to sit down here and count ceiling tiles - while Ward is missing . - Ward 's got drop boxes and storage lockers all over the world . They 're filled with currency , weapons , I.D.s. He 's gonna use aliases , cash ... anything to keep Lorelei off the radar . You 're the best radar we have . Find them . Sir , may I have a moment ? It 's about the GH-325 . - Have you found something ? - No . I 've hit a wall because of my limited resources . The drug 's chemical properties are foreign to me , - which is startling in its own right . - We 've been over this . So I 'm requesting once again to send a sample of Skye 's blood to H.Q. for further study . - That 's not an option . - Why ? I don 't need to explain to you the benefits of this drug . - You 've experienced them firsthand . - No . That 's an order . That 's not a good-enough reason ! I have a duty to you , sir , as my commanding officer . But I also have a duty as a S.H.I.E.L.D. scientist to pursue this , to save lives ! Given Ward 's recent situation , we should ... Two men laid down their lives in a compound rigged with explosives to keep this drug hidden . We still don 't know why . Until we do , until we speak with Fury and get some answers , that drug and its mysteries stay in-house . Focus on the mission . Lorelei has Ward , and we have no idea where she 's taking him . [ engine revs ] [ indistinct conversations ] Lorelei : I am fortunate to have found you . - You are quite resourceful . - Just well trained . [ chuckles ] No . You are worlds apart from those men in the desert . I 'm not an idiot . I know you value me no more than those bikers back there . - The truth is ... I don 't care . - Because of what you feel ? I 've felt something before for someone on my team . It seems foolish now . I would die for you . Any man would . But I don 't want them . I want you . You 're stronger ... a real man with the rage of a berserker inside . You will present me with an army . And I will give you a gift in return . [ gasping ] [ both panting , moaning ] When I first arrived here , I thought Earth left [ chuckling ] much to be desired . But from here , it 's quite beautiful . I 've spent the last 600 years locked away in a dark , cold cell ... my throat shackled ... my voice silenced . - Torture . - You never have to go back there . But Sif is on the hunt . She will not rest . She will not stop . And I will not know peace . So we take her out of the equation . Eliminate the threat . The graves of Asgard 's enemies are littered with men who underestimated Sif . Do not make the same mistake . You do not know her . No . I don 't . But the people she 's working with now ... I know them . May I ? [ chuckles ] - You have experience with swords . - Yes . - But I prefer to use my hands . - Admirable . But be warned ... Lorelei is quite skilled at combat . Then why co-opt men ? Why have them fight for her ? Well ... [ sighs ] ... I believe it gives her a thrill ... Especially if the man is already taken . And , besides , even the best warrior needs an army to conquer an empire . So her pattern remains . She attaches herself to the strongest warrior she can find and then unleashes a swath of blood and destruction . The man she 's with ... Ward ... he 's as lethal as any . - One of our best . - I see . [ sighs ] I 've been where you are , Melinda May ... a man I cared for , under her spell , so enchanted , forsook his family , his friends , me . Steel yourself to do what might be necessary . - Your Agent Ward ... - He 's not mine . Well , that is certainly true now . But Agent Ward is no longer the man you knew . - He will not hesitate to kill you . - Ward won 't kill me . Do not let your feelings cloud your judgment . I 'm not . He might try to kill me , but he won 't . [ footsteps approach ] Security cameras just caught sight of them . If Lorelei wants an army of wealthy , pliable men , I think she just hit the jackpot . - Woman : Clear . - Woman # 2 : Clear . Back room 's secure . Clear . - Bathroom clear . - Kitchen clear . All clear . Room secured . - Clear . - She 's gone . - Turn this suite upside down . - Yes , sir . I know you said you and Ward wouldn 't be a problem . But I also know you wouldn 't tell me if it was . Fitz , there are cameras everywhere in this town . Track them all . Fitz : No sign of them On any surveillance around the city . It was a long shot . Ward knows how we work , knows to avoid cameras . Well , I expanded my search , got satellite support running . We 'll find them . I do have a bit of good news . - I fixed Lorelei 's neck collar . - Let me inspect it to be sure . Asgardian metal is much different from the ore of this planet . Sure , but I think you 'll find it 's up to snuff . It 's in your room . You and Ward have the same training . You 're cut from the same cloth . If it was you , where would you run to ? Asgardian metal is so dense . Just had to find the right tools , really . But you 'll see ... not a scratch on it , because , yes ... I am that good . [ scoffs ] Well done . You really are quite clever . [ grunting ] [ pounding ] If I was Ward , I wouldn 't run . [ pounding continues ] I 'd take out my main threat . [ engines whirring ] [ pounding continues ] We 're taking off . Why are we taking off ? - What is that pounding ? - I 'll go and investigate . - You ... - Stay put . I know . [ door rattles ] Someone locked us in . - Fitz ? - Sir . Ward and Lorelei are on the bus . Where 's the collar and Sif ? In there . That 's why I 'm standing guard . Would not want Sif to get out and hurt Lorelei . Ah . Of course we wouldn 't . And Lorelei wants me to go down to the basement , - keep an eye on the girls downstairs . - Already locked them in . Cannot have them mucking up Lorelei 's plan . [ both chuckle ] She 's the best , isn 't she , sir ? Yep . She 's something else . [ chuckles ] Aren 't you the brave one ? You took my plane . I want it back . [ clicks tongue ] Well ... we can 't always get what we want . Actually ... I can . [ grunts ] Unh . Ohh . [ clicking ] [ air rushes ] [ gasps , grunts ] Lorelei : I will retrieve Sif 's sword . It will look better in my hand . - Ward , you don 't want to do this . - Ward : This was the plan . Cross off Sif , take the plane , eliminate anyone in our way . Get out of her way . It 's her plan , not yours . Fight it . I know you . You 're a fighter . Is this her ? The beautiful warrior with a heart of ice ? His heart now beats in concert with mine and mine alone . No reason to make this about us . Oh . He told me who he desired before me . But , my dear ... it wasn 't you . [ metal clangs ] Where 's Simmons ? - Oh ! - What the hell are you doing ? ! - Sir , are you ... you ? - Of course I am ! Fitz has Sif trapped in the cage . We need to unlock the door , get her out . What ? Coulson , they opened the airlock . She 's gone . Simmons : I 'm afraid she was sucked out of the aircraft . Coulson : Are you kidding ? She 's Asgardian . Sif 's still out there . Unlock it . Let her in . You , come with me . I need your help . [ grunting ] Anything else I can do to be of service ? Okay , good . Good . I 'll be right here . [ scoffs ] Leave me in peace . Return to Asgard . While you remain here ? I think not . [ beeping ] What is she doing ? No . Here I will no longer pose a threat to Asgard . [ sighs ] Can you not let me be ? Find some small mercy within your heart ? My heart has no place in this . I have orders to bring you back . [ scoffs ] All these years , and you 're still the same Sif , doing as you 're told , heeling at the feet of those who command you ... never to get what you desire ... not Haldorr , not ... Thor ... [ scoffs ] ... a man who considers you more pet than woman . Hand me my sword , Lorelei . See , that 's the difference between you and I. I don 't take orders . [ grunts ] [ both grunting ] Stay strong for me , baby girl . You stay strong . [ gasps ] Simmons . Hey , you 're not supposed to be up here ! Ward , I think we have a big problem ! [ both grunt ] You better get back here , Simmons . You cannot be running about , okay ? Lorelei does not want any ... - Coulson : Fitz . - Sir ? [ sighs ] Poor thing ! He 's always getting knocked out , isn 't he ? [ both grunting ] [ both grunting ] [ exhales heavily ] [ both panting ] Kill me . I 'd rather die than go back to that place . - You will not get off that easy . - Why ? It 's what you want . I can see it in your eyes . Or would you rather hear about how the man you loved followed me around like a dog ... [ breathing shakily ] ... hear of his touch , his kiss , the look in his eyes when I ... [ click , whir ] [ panting ] [ gulps ] You were saying ? [ both panting ] Sorry about this . [ gun clicks ] Whoa . Wait a minute . I 'm sorry . It 's me . Okay ? I 'm back . Lady Sif : He speaks the truth . Good to know . My apologies . The damage caused to your flying boat - was unfortunate . - It 's seen worse . I assure you , Lorelei will be punished severely for the crimes against your people . It must have been hard for you ... After everything she did , to move past it , to let it go . [ scoffs ] Odin ordered her back alive . As one of his warriors , I bow to his will . Regardless of what it cost you ? Much like your S.H.I.E.L.D. , we are bound by our code . I am honored to have fought by your side . I 'll run diagnostics , see how much damage we 're dealing with . How much are you dealing with ? - He didn 't break anything , so ... - Not what I meant . You should talk to him , hash it out . And you should take your own advice . You 've been sitting on something since the Guest House . [ sighs ] If not with me , then with Skye . She deserves to know what you saw down there . I figure ... I let you punch me again , repeatedly , - Just why don 't you just ... - It 's fine . It 's not . I never intended ... - I didn 't want to hurt ... - You didn 't . That was never a risk with me . I told you that . - You did . - Seems like we 're done here . Okay . But if what Lorelei said was true ... you were more honest with her than you are with yourself . Simmons : I 'm not saying you were weak . I 'm saying all men are weak . Sir . I understand why you had to punch me . I forgive you . Can I get a moment alone with Skye , please ? Yeah . [ sniffs ] I know that face , and something gives me a feeling I should be sitting down for this . [ sighs ] I 've been looking for a way to tell you this , looking around for some answers , something to help ... explain ... [ sighs ] ... but I don 't have any . So ... the drug , the one that saved us both ... when we found it , I discovered something else . Its source . It was ... alien . A-alien , as in ... unfamiliar ? No . Wow . The minute I learned what it was , I tried to keep them from injecting you with it , but I was too late . I 'm so sorry , Skye . You were trying to save my life . You did save my life . I was desperate to , and so I subjected you to unknown ramifications or side effects . I 'm sorry to say this , sir , but ... so what ? We are alive . And you 've had that stuff in you for ... uh , some time now , and you 're okay , right ? Plus , you 're not sprouting a pointy tail or anything , so bonus there . I know nothing fazes you , but this should faze you . - We are completely in the dark on this . - That 's where we live . I 'm an 0-8-4 . Who knows what the hell that means ? At least we 're in the dark together . Yes . But not for long . To hell with any protocols or any code I used to be bound by . We have a long list of questions we need answers for , and we 're going after them ourselves . - Well , if the team 's up for it ... - No . No , listen to me . I trust them , but we need to protect them from this . Fury went to dangerous lengths to keep this under wraps ... lied to me , lied to S.H.I.E.L.D. This is a powerful secret , a secret men died for . Until we know why , we can 't share this with anyone , for their safety and ours . Got it . So , what 'll it be , A.C. ? - What do we go after first ? - The person responsible for this . And we make him pay . Coulson : We 'll return in a moment . No , listen . I trust them , but we need to protect them from this . Fury went to dangerous lengths to keep this under wraps ... Lied to me , lied to S.H.I.E.L.D. This is a powerful secret , a secret men died for . Until we know why , we can 't share this with anyone , for their safety and ours . [ clicking ] [ beeping ] Woman : Encrypted line secure . Agent Melinda May . Update log 93 . He knows . I repeat ... Coulson knows .

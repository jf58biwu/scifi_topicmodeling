 Seven-year-old female , struck by a vehicle . GCS 3 . Chest injury , possible internal bleeding . - Stay with me , baby , please . - ETA , three minutes . We 're here , love . We 're right here . Let 's get her typed and crossed for three units . Kira , please . Excuse me . Excuse me . - This is as far as you can go . - No ! No ! Sarah ! Sarah ! We have to let them do their job . On three . One , two , three . I want an ultra sound and a trauma series . Chest , pelvic , C spine . Let 's get a level one on standby and a crash cart , we may need to intubate . - OR 's being prepped . - Good . I should 've known Helena would find us . I should 've stopped her . I won 't have you blaming yourself . You did not bring this on . She 's gonna be okay , Sarah . She has to be . Can I get anybody some coffee ? Alison ... I know you mean well . I know you do . - It 's just ... - I know . I know . I 'm in the way . Yeah . I just can 't help but feel like it 's my daughter in there . You should go home . You should get some sleep . I can 't go home , Felix . I ... I assaulted my monitor . I 'll get black bagged like Sarah and carted off to God knows where . Right ... Use my place then . Thank you . I 'll call you if we hear anything . Okay . Ultrasound 's up . Heart rate 's at 80 . BP , 85 over 50 . Doctor , you need to see this . What 's happening ? It looks like Kira 's going to be okay . What does " looks like " mean ? Well , she 's been sedated , but her blood pressure and breathing have stabilized . Her ribs are intact . There 's no internal bleeding , no head trauma . I think she 's gonna be fine . She was run right over . I saw it . Then she 's a very lucky girl . She 's okay . She 's okay , she 's okay , she 's okay . My baby . BBC America Orphan Black 01x09 - Unconscious Selection Original Air Date - May 25 , 2013 Mommy , she looks like you . She looks like Mommy . Just sleep now , monkey . I 'll keep you safe from her . I promise . There was a girl . A little girl . Easy child . Pull yourself together . Sarah is her mother . That 's ridiculous . Not possible . The girl was hit by a car because of me . She 's all right ? Yeah , yeah . She 's fast asleep . How about you then ? You thanking your lucky stars ? I don 't believe in miracles . Kids are made of rubber , Sarah . She got lucky . Just like the doctor said . You didn 't see it . Count your blessings . Move on to your worries . Yeah . Helena 's gotta go . I got a dozen reasons to bring Beth back in . Look , we got three sets of matching prints . Jumper looks just like her . And we got a smooth little rent boy connected to them both . All right . All right , I know , Angie . And here we got Jane Doe , the one that started it all . Bet you 100 bucks I know what she 's gonna look like when Beckwith is done with the reconstruction . You got no charge that 'll stick yet . Obstruction . This all comes on the heels of that civilian shooting . - So what ? - So , she could be protecting the killer . How 's it going ? Still pushing for a break , sir . Grigson and Chow just solved that stabbing in the junction . Maybe you need a fresh pair of eyes here ? No , we 're good , sir . We 're good . Just give us till the end of the day . You want me to throw my ex-partner under the bus ? If I 'm wrong about this , you 'll be the last partner I ever have . I don 't know , Art . Starting to wonder . Does she have something on you ? End of day , Angie . If this is true , if the child 's actually hers ... How could you let her go ? She 's innocent . I did what I was told . I ... Used Sarah to get to the others . Then where are the others ? Why is Sarah still alive ? That man Olivier took off his beast-tail for you . Yes . To get Dr. Leekie 's attention ! The child will be valuable to them . No , no . That 's her . Tell her to come here . Tell her ! Helena ! Is Kira all right ? I 'll tell you in person . Where are you ? It ... It was an accident . Tell her . Lovely apartment for a young couple . Very convincing . Unfortunately , the lie Olivier told last night was not . What lie ? Someone tampered with the security footage at club Neolution . But I know there were two clones there that night . Weren 't there ? I 've searched for the lost clone , Helena , for years . She 's my white whale , Paul . But she 's feral . She couldn 't fool you . Impersonate Beth ... Under this roof ... In that bed . But Sarah Manning could . What the hell ! A simple " thank you " would suffice . So , Kira 's going to be okay ? Yes . Miraculous recovery . Where 's my . Your ... Drug paraphernalia is in a drawer . So is the paraphernalia that was by your bed . Did you wash that , too ? My children are at my mother 's house right now . I 'm a danger to them . So , I was thinking , I could use this house as a base while I apartment hunt . No . Well , Donnie 's staying clear of the house for a few hours , so ... I just need to go by , get some sundries , and clothing . Fine . You can stay one night . Just don 't wake me on your way back in . Felix . Felix . I 'm a pariah . I can 't go back there alone . I need you to be my wingman . Are you bloody serious ? Please . I need to change . Fetch me something gay . Holy shit ! Sarah , I 'm so relieved . Yeah , even the doctors were stunned . Do you think because Kira 's mine , she might be different ? Because she 's uninjured ? Yeah , it 's just a question . Well , if they genetically modified us , I mean , you could have passed something down to her . Like what ? Don 't know . Lizards regrow limbs . Cosima , Kira 's not a lizard . Right . Well , it 's not magic . It 's just stem cells , you know . Look , I have a guy who 's sequencing the German 's DNA alongside mine to see if the illness she had was genetic . If you want , I can give him samples of you and Kira to compare . Yeah . I 'm not giving you our genetic material . You 'll probably hand it over to Delphine . Dude , I 'm just doing what we agreed . - Okay ? I 'm following the science . - Yeah , well ... I worry about scientists more than science . Got to go . Hey , I got it . - Hey . - Hey . Coloring books and puzzles . She 's sleeping . Mrs. S , this is Paul . Pleasure . - Paul ? - She knows everything . Well , not everything . Clearly . Well , don 't hold it against me , but I have some bad news . Dr. Leekie knows who you are , Sarah . Let go ! Let go . No ! No ! No ! I gave you everything , a reason for living , - and in return , weakness . - Tomas , please ... If you protect this forgery ... You 're no better than they are . You 're no better than they are ! No ! Leekie wants to meet ? Says he wants to make a deal . He knows you 're aware , in contact with each other . Did Cosima give me up ? Look , this is an opportunity . You sound exactly like her . I don 't trust him either . But the genie 's out of the bottle . For them , too . Your interests have aligned . You can get answers . Or I could get black bagged and abducted . What if there was a way to meet him safely ? On your terms . Over 4,000 base pairs from each sample , sequenced and analyzed . Awesome . Awesome . Okay , what did you ... What did you find ? No markers for respiratory disease . This sequence is anomalous for Cytochrome C. And then , this piece is distinct in each sample . They 're different . That 's ... That 's crazy . What are you looking for , really ? Not respiratory disease . Nope . Hey . Hey ! - Hey . - Scott , this is Delphine . - Hello . - Hey . I have to run to class but I was wondering if I could ... come over later . Yeah , of course . Okay . Whoa ! Wow ! Okay . Bye . Bye . If she wakes up , just tell her I 'm gonna be right back . And will you ? Yeah . Are you gonna be okay here ? Don 't you worry about Helena . Shotgun . Forgot about that . One of the great things about this country , hunting 's not just for the rich . Kind of busy here , Art . Pilates can wait , Beth . We need to talk . We already did that . Off the record this time . No one else . This is your last chance . Where are you ? You know , I get crow 's feet if I don 't get enough shuteye . I will have you back on your couch in a jiff . - My God ! - Alison . What , what ... What 's going on ? What is this ? We 're gathered in the spirit of love and understanding . Please , join us . An intervention ? This is bullshit ! Hello ! - Felix . Gay friend . - Acting coach . That 's perfectly fine here . - Which one ? - Yes , yes . Please join us . Alison , your ... Your friends have shown great strength in setting aside their pain and hurt in order to talk with you today . Donnie , why don 't you go ahead and get us started ? Yeah . Alison ... The pills and the drinking , it has to stop . I don 't think you know how hard this has been for me . The constant criticism , the abuse ... You can be specific , Donnie . You hit me with a golf club . You burned my chest with hot glue . It still hurts in the shower , Alison . Donnie ... Alison , it 's actually important for you to just try and listen right now . Aynsley . Alison , you took advantage of my husband , and may have ruined my marriage , too . You threatened and assaulted me . But I think what really hurts is that you ... turned your back on our friendship . - Donnie , tell her that we ... - Mom ! I will . It 's ... It 's not just about you and me , Alison . It 's about our kids . Do you really want to break up our family ? Alison . I have two minutes . Two minutes ? That 's all I get for two years by your side . - Who 's that ? - Felix Dawkins . Your look-alike Sarah Manning 's foster brother . Yeah , and ... You visited his place a few weeks back with $ 75,000 in your trunk . The day I stopped you from skipping town . It 's all coming back to the Maggie Chen shooting . You don 't wanna go there , Art . You put the phone in Maggie Chen 's hand . You helped me make it look like it was an accident . I was trying to help my partner . This is your last chance to come clean with me , Beth . We do what we gotta do . Sarah , you were right . I was wrong . Okay , what have you done with Cosima 'cause this definitely isn 't her . Is ) Ha-ha . Okay . Listen , they can tell us apart by our DNA . That 's how they knew you weren 't Beth . So we 're not genetically identical ? We should be . But there 's a synthetic sequence . I don 't know what it is exactly . But it 's like a barcode maybe . Maybe a way to differentiate us . Well , that explains how Olivier knew I wasn 't Beth . But it does not explain how Leekie knows my name . He knows who you are ? Yeah . And he knows we 're in contact . Did you say something to Delphine ? No . Sarah , no ! I , I ... 'Cause they 're one step closer to Kira . Okay . I would never say anything about you or Kira . You are the first one of us to ever even have a child . I mean , there 's not even taxonomy in the offspring of a clone . By the way , you got what you wanted . 'Cause I 'm about to meet Leekie . Really ? Just give him a chance . You might be surprised . They care about us . They , they , they have to . Yeah , I was thinking of putting a gun to his head . Sorry for the precautions . No , no , no . I understand completely . Hello , Sarah . Dr. Leekie . You 've gleaned how this works . There are many questions I can 't answer . That 's not good enough . I understand your frustration , but like Olivier or Paul , I only know my part . So , what is your part ? I oversee data collection and quantify your well-being . I look after you . Not me . No . Somehow you got away . Jesus Christ ! Just tell me why . What ... What is this all about ? We can go further , Sarah . Much further . But we need to come to an agreement on something crucial . Helena . The common enemy , obviously . Olivier said she mentioned Tomas . Who 's that ? Great question and one I can answer . Tomas opposes us , science in general . They 're religious extremists . Prolethians , they call themselves . Right , " neolutionist " is way better ? Years ago , one of their agents infiltrated our project . Maggie Chen . - The woman Beth shot ? - Yes . She and Tomas found Helena in a convent . Then trained the clone to kill clones . Brilliant really . That 's brilliant . So what ? You want me to kill her ? No . We don 't want to harm her at all . We want you to bring her in so we can ( Xe-program ' new . Get her the help she needs . You do this , and we can move forward with a new understanding . You and your friends will be free to live as you choose . No monitors . You 're gonna give us lives ? You 've always had lives . They haven 't been directed , just observed . Except in your case . And Helena 's . Helene 's been under their care . Which is far , far worse than ours . Bring her in . We 'll get her the help she needs . I have the truffles that I promised you . You okay ? Are you ? I was , but ... Delphine Cormier , not Beraud . You 've already got your doctorate in immunology , don 't you ? I am so sorry . I am so stupid . No , no . No , you 're not . You knew this all along . Yeah , that transcript you accidentally left behind . Your fake boyfriend in Paris . Pretending you didn 't know who Dr. Leekie was . I knew it was bullshit . I still thought you were on my side . I wanted to trust you . You can trust me . You told Leekie I know these girls . I ... had to . Look at me . He says you 're in danger . Of what ? You ... You don 't know , do you ? No . Then you 're the real danger , Delphine . Alison . You 're only making things worse . I only want to talk to Felix . This is all Aynsley . She put them up to this . It 's all part of her experiment . Yes . How do clones react when ritually humiliated by friends and loved ones ? Fascinating . Hey . Sharesies ? Maybe it 's not just Aynsley . Maybe they 're all monitors . The reverend seems all right . Actually , he 's kind of sexy . Man of the cloth and all that . Felix , what am I gonna do ? Put your chin up , be a woman . This is backstabbing 101 . I cannot go back out there . Of course you can . You 're gonna face the music , eat some humble pie , hug it out , play possum , Aynsley 's gonna think she 's won , and you are gonna live to fight another day . Lord . Can you help me get my face on ? With pleasure . Helene still won 't answer . What do you plan to do ? Turn her over to Leekie ? I don 't know . I don 't know what he 's really gonna do with her , do I ? Does that matter ? She came after your daughter . Yeah , my gut says put a bullet in her myself , but ... You don 't understand what it 's like . I look at Helena and I see me . You don 't owe her anything , Sarah , I um ... I got in touch with my people back in England . - About where you 're really from . - And ? They said they 'd get back to me , but ... They 're scared . As if something 's going on over there , too . Please , Cosima . Where are you going ? Why , so you can tell Leekie ? I 'm such an idiot . What else did you tell him ? Nothing ! Just the seven names . Nothing about Kira . She 's an anomaly , you know that ? Delphine , you can use me , that 's fine ... But don 't go near that little girl . I didn 't and I won 't ! Get out ! Please listen to me . Just let me tell you this one thing . Just listen to me . I didn 't want to fall for you . I wasn 't supposed to . But I have . How can I possibly believe that , Delphine ? Because you feel it . This is not ... It 's not a lie , it 's not possible . You know , I 've never been with a woman before . Yeah , it showed . Twenty-third , right ? Yeah , east platform , north end , I was , on the other side fixing a derailer . That 's her . What a shame . It 's Beth . And then this other lady walks up . That 'd be your jumper . Wait , wait , wait ! Rewind that , right , stop right there . Shit ! I never saw it from this angle . - Helena ? - Sarah ! You 're the only one I can really turn to . How do you know it 's not a trap ? - She was convincing . - It is a trap . Now you know where she is . Just give her to Leekie . I 'd have to agree with him at this point . What , and then what ? Then we 're partners with Leekie ? And then , he 's going to find out about Kira . Sarah ... I don 't know how I 'm going to play this . Okay ? I just ... Just give me a minute . Hey , you 're awake . How do you feel ? - Tired . - Yeah . You had a big crash . But you 're going to be just fine . It wasn 't Helena 's fault . What ? I went outside to play with her . Did she tell you to say this ? No . She 's dangerous . She 's sick in the head and it makes her want to hurt us . She just needs your help . I 'm sorry , Kira , I don 't think anybody can help Helena now . Alison , I saw you in that van with Chad . My children saw you . I just wish you could understand how much damage you 've caused , I mean , we all trusted you . Aynsley , you brought us here today , didn 't you ? I care about you , sweetie . You called all these people and told them everything . I 'm doing this to help you . And I thank you . For scrutinizing every detail of my life , since the day I moved into this fish pool . You have pried and snooped and gossiped about me , like I was your own , personal , laboratory subject . How would you like it if I turned your life inside-out ? If I told all these people that Chad , your husband , slept with a spin class instructor long before me . Well , maybe he acts that way because you blew the roofer at the cabin ! Wow ! Okay , um ... - Alison , you see ... - No ! No more words . She 's right . This has gone far enough . Mom , everybody , out , now ! Let 's go . This was your olive branch and you torched it . Huge mistake . That went very well . - I think it went well . - Yeah . You came ? How 's Kira ? You 're never going to see her again . I would never hurt her . I wish I could believe you . Do it . Shit ! You care . No , I don 't . Stay back , don 't try any shit . You are all I have now . I love you . You must be Sarah ? You can 't harm her kid . Harm her ? No , never . The child is innocent . You were the light , Helena . You 're the original , you know what that means . The child is rightfully your daughter . He 's lying ! Helena , Helena ! There 's no original . I told you , we 're the same . Neither of us is the original . Put it down . Go bring your child home , to her real mother . Helena , Helena ! Look , look ... You know that connection you feel ? I feel it , too . It 's us . She 'll say anything to save herself . He locked you in a cage ! He lied to you your entire life . He 's going to do that to Kira ! He 's going to hurt Kira like he hurt you . You made me this way . Helena ... I know what you are . Yeah , I 'm the one with the keys . Maybe I 'll give them to Dr. Leekie . Come on . Sarah ! Sarah ! Sarah , where are you ? I 'm about to give Helena to Leekie . He knows who I am . He 's going to find out about Kira sooner or later . You can 't . You need to get back here right away with Helena . What ? Why ? I 'll explain when you get here . Sarah ! You wanted to see me ? Yeah . It 's about Beth Childs . Sorry , she said she 'd be here . Yes ? Helena didn 't show . Blood is thicker than you think , Aldous . Jesus Christ . How long has Art been sitting on this ? Just a couple of days , sir . Really , Angela ? You said by the end of the day . We 're getting an arrest warrant for Beth Childs . Lieutenant ... Beth 's dead . You need a warrant for Sarah Manning . Where 's Helena ? I tied her up in the trunk . What 's going on ? Sarah , this is Amelia . Hi . Look at you . Sarah . I 'm your birth mother . Yeah , I 'm not what you expected , I 'm sure . I kind of gave up expecting . I 'm sorry to arrive like this but ... When word came you were looking for me I had to leave Cape Town in a hurry . I was being watched , you see ... After all this time they ... They found me again . I was only 22 . In a new country . A wealthy couple asked me to be their in vitro surrogate . They paid me , provided a flat in London , a legal arrangement . But ... Something was off . The medical tests were excessive . And I overheard the couple talking with the doctors about a child unfettered by tradition . An advanced , um ... Evolution of some kind . - Neolution ? - Yeah ! But they weren 't a couple at all . They were scientists . The child I carried wasn 't meant for them . I realized the life inside of me was in danger . So I ran , I hid . And gave birth to the two of you in secret . The two of us ? Yeah . I had twins . I knew I couldn 't keep you . So I hid you away . One to the state , and one to the church . Helena ? Who do you work for ? I need to see you privately . I have something for you . - Mind Amelia . - Why ? I found a known associate . Isn 't this place off limits to you guys ? - Yes ? - Alison ! Cosima ! - Sarah Manning ! On the ground , now ! - Sarah Manning !

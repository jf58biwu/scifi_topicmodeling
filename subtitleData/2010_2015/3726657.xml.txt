 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Hello . Customer . I have a special order . So I just moved here why on earth would you do that ? Unh . Awh . Oh ... . Dude . Claudia wait a minute . I got the parts you ordered . Oh , your a wonderkin . So Claudia , it 's hot in here this is me ignoring you . Oh ! Ahh ! Myka ! Eat shield , stabby ! Oh , hey , are you okay ? Yeah . Here you go . Let me help you up . Here we go . Okay . Where 'd you learn to handle a sword like that ? Some girls play with Barbies , and others took fencing lessons . Everybody got all their limbs ? Yeah , that 's a big ten fingers and ten toes , good buddy . Behold mighty Excalibur . You snagged it . This could have been a lot easier if we just swapped it out for a fake . Yeah , only you , Artie , would know it was a tacky wall decoration in some cheesy castle in Cardiff . The rock , it worked ? Yes , you were right . You know , as soon as the blade came into contact with the rock that was laced with the same metal , it- - then the sword went out of phase and allowed it to pass right through solid matter . Preventing today 's pub special from being Myka meat pie . You realize that 's how King Arthur pulled the sword from the stone . Oh , nice , Artie . You sure know how to take the fun out of believing in legends . No , no , no , some legends can have a bit of truth to them . So--so there was a real Merlin the magician ? Fiction . Knights of the Round Table ? Bedtime story . Holy Grail ? Anyway , on your way back I want you to check something out for me in Italy . That 's not really on our way back . Yeah , but I got a ping , so go to Milan . Call me when you land . I 've never been to Italy . So how 'd she die ? Old age . No identification . But we found these inside her body . Those look like- - implants . The old woman had silicone breast implants . I 've never seen them like this . You know , when they weren 't on active duty . Something else . The woman was shouting something before she died . That 's Russian . You speak Russian ? Yeah , you know , some girls played with Barbies and- - got it , got it . What 'd she say ? It means , uh ... It means , " they stole me . " I think I know how we can I.D. her . All surgical implants are labeled and coded by serial number , so you can track them through the doctor and back to the patient . Why am I not surprised that you are the expert on breast implants ? Some boys played with Barbies . Mmm . Now these implants were placed in the body of ... Wait a minute . That--that can 't be right . I don 't get it . Who is that ? Anya Verdikov , age 19 . Anya Verdikov . Wait , wait , you know her ? Yes , she 's a Russian model in Milan for the fashion show . Okay , well , we need to meet with her right away . She was reported missing two days ago . You think ? We have seen stranger things . What are you saying ? Either someone took the implants out of Anya Verdikov and put them in the body of this old woman . Or this woman is the 19-year-old Anya Verdikov . ♪ Warehouse 13 2x04 ♪ Age Before Beauty Original Air Date on July 27 , 2010 Hello . Hey , welcome back . What 'd you bring me from Italy ? You know it . Hey , biscotti . What ? Hey . It was a long flight . Okay , so what else did you find out about Anya Verdikov ? Lots . Found out that Anya was not the first--Claudia , would you do the honors ? Missing fashion models . They vanished from different cities . From Tokyo , Berlin , and Paris , and London . So since we knew what to look for , it wasn 't hard to find a pattern . And after each model disappeared , in the same city they found the body of a Jane Doe . Elderly . Yes . Very old Jane Doe . And it seemed like it was natural causes , but I don 't think so . Yeah , an unidentified old Asian woman- - Asian woman was found dead two months ago in Paris . Hey , same tattoo . Same place . Same woman . Okay , have you ever seen an artifact that produces rapid aging in a person ? I 've never seen anything that causes this . So obviously it 's not a coincidence that all these victims were models , right ? All right , so what 's the plan ? Since all these attacks happened around the fashion industry and since this week in full swing in Manhattan is Fashion Week , two tickets to New York . Nice . Original Ray 's pizza . The original original Ray 's pizza is actually in the Warehouse . And funny thing about that is the mob bought the original cheese . You can 't make a decent pie without mob cheese . Artie . Okay , so the way to stop this is to find Anya 's Agent . The Agent will tell you where 's Anya has been and hopefully also what she 's been in touch with . Okay , perfect . Yeah . Oh , hey , Artie , what aisle is- - not a chance . Forget it . Yeah , I 'll run an artifact search on the mainframe , see what might make the beautiful people go geezer . Thank you . That would be very help- - God , stop it . Something you 'd like to share with the rest of the class , Miss Donovan ? No . No ? That only makes me a little bit more curious . Todd keeps texting me . Oh , you know , texting . It 's what the kids do these days instead of going to dinosaur races . I know what texting is- - also iTunes and color television . What is a Todd ? Todd . You know , Todd . The guy from town , from the hardware store . Oh , God , what is with him ? " Want to meet for coffee ? " Give me my space ! No , no , no , why don 't you text him back ? I remember that kid . He was ... Inoffensive . Well , strike up the band . No , no , no , I mean , you 're not a girl anymore . What ? You--hmm ? I just said , you know , you 're a woman . No , well , you 're a woman because you 're over 16 . I 'm just saying he 's a man and men and women- - I- - if you 've never- - oh , God . I didn 't mean to- - pull up , pull up , pull up . I appreciate the advice , but can we just get back to work ? Best assignment ever . Just try not to be 12 years old , okay ? There is no try . Only do or do not . Then do . I 'll try . I have a quick meeting with Michael , and after that I 'm going home . Would you ask Sutton if we can reschedule ? Oh , my- - Isabella Fuentes . Oh , oh , man . I--I love you . No , I--I love your work . The 2004 Swimsuit Issue , I mean , that was like your Sgt. Pepper 's . It was so- - thank you . If you 'll excuse me , I 'm not feeling well . No , no , no , look , I won 't take up a whole lot of your time . I was just curious where you stood on dating civil servants . You 're scaring her . Ask anyone who 's made an enemy of me , Sutton , if they don 't dearly regret that decision . What- - what , are we opening a Walmart ? Call Damian , have him send Romana another gift basket . No food . Miss Harris . I 'm Myka Bering . This is Pete Lattimer . We spoke on the phone regarding Anya Verdikov . Have you found her ? I told her I would take care of her . Do you have any idea what happened ? Well , we were hoping you might know . I mean , was she acting at all strangely ? Well , was there anyone new that she might have come into contact with ? No one . She 'd been staying away from people . Why ? Just before Milan , Anya said she was coming down with the flu . If you 'll excuse me , I 'm not feeling well . It 's Isabella . Pete ? Isabella . You 're nothing if not persistent . You don 't look so good . Your pickup lines are getting worse . I need you to come with me . I think you might be in danger . What are you talking- - are you okay ? Isabella ? I 'm sorry , I must be getting a fever . I 've just gotta get out of here . Hey , hey , hey , hey . I 'm burning ... Up . Pete ? Pete ! Pete ? Pete , what 's happening ? Get an ambulance . It was nothing , girls . Just some poor old woman who took a fall . What 's the matter with you ? It just happened . You know , it was like a nightmare . I-I couldn 't help , and I- - I just had to stand there and watch , Artie . Pete , there was nothing you could do . Now listen , get me the- - I mean , look , we 've seen a lot of bad juju from these artifacts , but man , this one- - get your head back in the game . Get me a sample of her blood right away . It could lead to whatever artifact is causing this aging thing . Yeah . They 're keeping a lid on what happened to Isabella for us . You okay ? Yeah , I will be when we find this thing . Well , I tested her clothes and jewelry . The artifact definitely wasn 't on her . Well , it wouldn 't be . She probably got zapped after a fashion show like Anya and the others . But why models ? What 's the connection , some hair dryer that they 're all using ? Well , Anya said , " they stole me . " As if somebody was doing this to them on purpose . There are hundreds of people behind the scenes at these things . And fashion week ends in three days , and with it goes most of our potential suspects . All right , so we 're gonna have to get in on the down low and smoke out the bad guy or girl . That 's easier said than done . What ? Just having a thought . Well , is it a good thought ? Well , I 'm gonna say yes . You 're gonna say no . But I 'm right , you 're wrong . Oh , hey , Miss Harris . Look , I think I know a way to find the person who 's doing this , okay , but I 'm gonna need your help . Hey . So how 'd we do ? You tell me . ♪ ♪ Holy crap . Welcome to the runway . One day you 're in , and the next day- - yeah , yeah , we- - we get it . Through there 's backstage where the models change during the show . I hope you don 't find taking your clothes off in public . Let me go sell you to Damian . I just don 't understand why I had to be the model . Well , first of all , I don 't have the legs for a dress like that . And a model and her manager won 't stand out . Oh , please , nobody 's gonna believe that I 'm a model . Pete , I don 't know how to do this . Just act like everyone 's been put on the earth to serve you . That 's idiotic . Just like that , perfect . No , no , no , no , no , no , no . I couldn 't possibly work with a new girl . I 'm all about rapport , Sutton . You can 't have rapport with someone fresh off the farm . She 's an undiscovered treasure . That 's fine .

Man , I gotta stop looking at that . Pete . Right . I did find out that Romana hated Anya . Really ? Well , you know , it 's a tough business . Maybe she 's eliminating the competition . Why don 't you go distract her so I can check her dressing room ? But I don 't know how to distract her . Ask her for tips on torturing your assistant . So what 's your favorite movie ? God , I hate that . Yeah , me too . I mean , there 's , like , eight billion different movies , right ? I mean , you can never pick just one . And then am I telling you my real favorite movie or just randomly picking the first movie that pops into my head ? Godfather . So what High School did you go to ? What do you mean ?

I 'm clearly a closed book with bad breath who 's too freakish to live , and I gotta go . No . Oh ! Oh , my God . She wants this to go . Romana , hi there . My name 's Myka . We met the other day in Sutton 's office . Tell Damian it 'll do . I was just wondering if you had any , you know , sisterly advice . My advice : Spanx . You know , I 'm always amazed at the correlation between being beautiful and being a complete bitch . Being a successful model isn 't about beauty and it certainly isn 't about the clothes . Well , then what 's it about ? When I walk down the runway , with one look I can stop a war or start one . I make people want something that I have , because when I 'm out there I tear out my soul and I offer it for everyone to see . You think you can do that , sister ? Jenny , the schedule , please . I 'll be right there . Booyah Buddha . I don 't suppose you gave the same sisterly advice to Anya . Anya shoulda stayed in Russia and stuck with what she knew- - borscht and bread lines . Sounds to me like you 're glad she 's dead . You 're very nosy . No , I 'm just curious about the people I work with . I wonder if the next girl will ask what happened to you . It 's all over , Jenny . What are you talking about ? Is that it ? Oh , crap . Jenny , why are you doing it ? I 'm not hurting anybody . Then you 've got a pretty whacked-out definition of " hurt , " lady . They can afford to pay . Is that how Anya paid , with her youth ? How did you kill her , Jenny ? I didn 't kill Anya . She wasn 't even a customer . A customer ? No , look , how is the Buddha aging the models ? What are you talking about ? What are you talking about ? Diet pills . Diet what now ? Hey , hey , hey , easy , that 's ... Filled with teeny-tiny pills . You 're peddling diet pills ? They 're the good ones , not legal here yet . I get them on the black market for the- - you 're not here about the diet pills , are you ? Okay , look , here 's what you 're gonna do . You 're gonna go home , you 're gonna call in sick , and you 're gonna stay there until you hear from me , or you 'll be explaining that little bobble-headed Buddha to the DEA . Or I can hook you up if you let me go . You could lose those extra five pounds by , like , tomorrow . I don 't have an extra five pounds . Right . Go ! Okay . Myka , we 're running out of time . I know . I couldn 't believe it when you finally called . Anticipation has been interminable . You said you found her , the one ? Yes , she 's perfect . Oh , good , you 're here . Well , the blood sample that Pete sent over has got trace elements of silver nitrate in it , which is not commonly found in human blood . Ha ha , what does that mean ? I have no idea . So what I- - how was your date ? It was perfect . Well , good . Good . So as I was saying , human blood- - actually no kind of blood- - has sil- - what ? What kind of advice is be yourself ?

Other than a sudden desire to hit the early bird special , I 'm fine . What are we gonna do ? How is she ? She doesn 't have much time . Isabella died about an hour ago from old age , Artie . She was 22 . Yeah . Now what do you need to undo this ? A sample of Myka 's blood would be- - what else ? Silver nitrate , it 's in Myka 's blood too . Exactly the same as Isabella 's . Silver nitrate ? Yeah , it was a compound that was used as a disinfectant before the development of antibiotics . Wait , wait , wait , it was also used in the manufacture of photographic film . I was doing something . Gus used to say- - Gus was a former Warehouse Agent- - and he used to say that there was a camera that belonged to--there . Man Ray . I 'm on it . Give me an address . But he 's dead , he 's dead . What ? Yeah , he was a photographer in the 1930s . Guy shot some wicked cool pics . Contemporary of Salvador Dali , except that Ray was into photographic surrealism . And Gus used to say that one of Ray 's last cameras had artifact properties . It 's just we never found it . Well , so then it 's gotta be one of the photographers . Which brings us back to what Claudia was doing before Artie so rudely took her computer . I hacked into the fashion show security cameras . Now let me just get a good angle . There , that guy . Check the camera . Not exactly state-of-the-art , right ? Right . Now look , he takes Myka 's picture , he walks . Artie and Claudia : It 's him . Can I interest you in changing your long distance carrier ? No thanks . Can I interest you in staying alive , huh ? Where is it ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . I said where is it ? Claudia , Man Ray 's . Jackpot . And that is not all . Hey , hey , hey , Myka said there was an old lady giving her the stink eye , and she had on huge Ruby earrings . This camera doesn 't just steal people 's youth . It transfers it to another person . You 've been peddling a second chance at life . How does the camera work , huh ? How does the camera work ? Pete , lay off . We might need this guy . All right . You double-expose a younger photograph over someone older . The process is almost instantaneous . Myka and the others didn 't change right away . No , no , no , that would be a little too public , wouldn 't it ? What you did is you figured out how to do it later . Something to do with the development process , right ? Did you hear the question ? Do you doubt that my friend wants to beat your to death ? It works retroactively if I wait and use the developer . The silver nitrate . Right ? Silver nitrate . But why models ? I mean , why not just snap pictures of anonymous young people ? You ever heard the expression " make love to the camera ? " A model has a gift . She bares her soul , opens up . Manny 's camera captures it , reacts to it . How do we turn Myka back ? Look out ! Artie ! They told me what happened . You , young man , have to stop playing with fire . Yeah , close call . I didn 't need the Phoenix this time . I remembered to duck . Doctors say you 're doing great . Liar . How are you ? I just wish I could see my mom and dad . They could never cope with this . Artie , I just want to tell you that , um , I know I 've been hard on you sometimes . Don 't . Okay ? Don 't--don 't start that . I 'm not giving up on you . Don 't you give up . All right , listen , we have to find this Ruby earring woman . We have to take a new photograph of her young and superimpose it on a photograph of old Myka . And it might switch her back ? Well , I 'm in his bank account . And he hasn 't touched anything since the last deposit but- - something ? Well , he 's got a serious crush on someone . He 's had flowers delivered from the same shop three times this week . Does it say to who ? No , this just lists his transactions . Romana . What ? Romana had flowers delivered to her , and she wasn 't very happy with whoever sent them . I 'm on it , I 'm on it . You see ? Even at 90 , you are a crack Agent . Pete , wait . What if you find him and he doesn 't tell you who he sold Myka 's youth to ? Do we find someone else , take someone else 's youth ? I mean , someone bad ? He 'll tell me . Go . Consider me an ex-fan of man Ray . Manny 's . What ? Perry didn 't say man Ray 's camera . He said Manny 's . So ? Romana . Oh , Perry , you scared me half to death . I haven 't got much time . I need you to listen to me . What do you want ? I think you know . We 've been through this . You and I , we 're never gonna happen . That 's right . I 'm not your type , am I ? Rich and powerful . Guess what , I 'm both now . What is that supposed to mean ? I never used the camera for financial gain . What camera ? Until I met you . You know what , I have to go . I 'm finally wealthy enough now to have the most beautiful woman in the world . You 'll never have that much money . Don 't you understand ? Everything I did was for you , for us to be together . Just let go of me . Let go of me . Hey ! You 've had Man Ray 's camera for a long time , haven 't you ? In fact , you actually knew Manny . I modeled for him when I was 22 years old . He gave me that camera . I kept it all these years . And that 's how you discovered its restorative properties , Hmm ? And the first person that it turned young was you . I look pretty good for 98 . And how many innocent lives did your vitality cost ? I would imagine you double exposed my image with your friend 's . You 've been young long enough . Back again . Excuse me . Oh . Are you okay ? Well , yeah . Thanks to you guys . Well , you know , it 's in my contract , if my partner turns into a senior citizen and I don 't do anything about it , it 's , like , six vacation days , so I didn 't really- - yeah . It was all about the vacation . Yeah . I 'm so glad to see you looking like the old you .

Yes , crabby , come on . Um , Pete . Yes ? You know , I just want to say thank you . You 're welcome . Not--not--not for- - for what you said before the show . Right , we don 't have to ever mention that again . But remember you said that I- - la , la , la . Can 't hear- - I think that we should- - warning ! Warning ! Danger , Will Robinson . Okay . No cream . Why are we doing this ? You don 't see enough of me ? Sit down . I owe you an apology . You owe me lots of apologies . Which one 's nagging at you right now ? The one about Todd . Not a big deal . Yeah , it is . It doesn 't matter . It does matter , because he 's really a good kid , and I should be able to help . You didn 't make me a train wreck . You are not a train wreck , Claudia . I just sometimes forget that underneath the talented computer programmer and fearless junior Warehouse Agent there beats the heart of a teenage girl who deserves , well , someone better than me for a ... Uh ... Father figure ? Oh , my God . You 're not doing so bad . Well , I- - I could do a little better . I 'll do- - you know , I can do better . Sometimes you are so cute . Don 't do that . I hate that word . Don 't use that word , cute . I 'm not cute . Well , I am relieved . When you said , " meet me at the diner , " I thought you 'd arranged some lame meet with me and Todd . Um , Todd . What a remarkable coincidence . Hey . Hey . I don 't know if I mentioned this before , but I really like chili . Artie , get out . Yes , leaving . Ahem .

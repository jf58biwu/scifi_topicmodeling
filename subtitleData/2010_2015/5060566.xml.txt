 WALTER : A person 's soul continues to live on after death . NARRATOR : Previously on Fringe : All we have to do is to summon the soul and he 'll be back here with us ! Soul magnets ? William is gone . You can 't bring him back . These soul magnets drew your consciousness into Olivia ? [ AS BELL ] I assure you she is totally safe . Now , Olivia 's brain can accommodate my consciousness for several weeks . Weeks ? Not a chance . Forty-eight hours . Then I want you out of my agent or I 'll have Dr. Bishop figure out how to drive you out . [ HUMMING ] [ AS BELL ] " The Little Old Lady From Ipanena . " It 's " The Girl From Ipanema . " And no . Try again . OLIVIA : Oh , Walter , can we try something else ? No show tunes . You take all the fun out of it . What 's the temperature , son ? - We 're at 64 degrees . - Perfect . Astro , are we ready ? Just about , Wally . - You sure this is safe ? WALTER : Perfectly . If everything goes according to plan the electrical current will latch on to the dominant consciousness , Belly 's and coax it into its new residence . - I meant safe for Olivia . Oh , of course . - No offense . - Oh , none taken . Olivia 's mind is still peacefully at rest . She won 't be aware of any of this . Though we should all take a few steps back . Excuse me ? It 's perfectly safe , son . I assure you . EEGs are online . - Ready , Belly ? - Aye , aye , captain . - Do it , dear . - Okay . Three , two , one . [ ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ] [ ELECTRICITY POWERING DOWN ] Walter , it didn 't work . Damn . You can reset the circuit breakers , dear and tell the medical school we 're returning Mr. Spencer . Sorry . So , what now ? Well , now I guess we try and find another brain-dead host . What makes you think it 'll go better this time ? I have a new idea . You said that if you didn 't find a suitable host in 48 hours , you would just go away . Are you suggesting that I die ? I 'm suggesting that I want Olivia back . And I 'm losing patience . - [ IN NORMAL VOICE ] Peter . Peter , help me . - Astrid ! - What happened ? WALTER : Call 911 . Female , 31 years old . Tonic-clonic seizures . No response to 4 milligrams lorazepam IV . - BP 's 190 over 110 . DOCTOR : Trauma Bay 2 . Pupils dilated . How long has she been seizing ? - Going on 20 minutes . - Twenty-five . Okay . Start her on a phenytoin drip . - No , that 's wrong . - Excuse me ? - Step outside unless you 're family . - She 's my girlfriend . He 's my partner . William cannot tolerate phenytoin . - He 's anemic . - She 's crashing . Let 's defib at 360 . - Too much ! It 's too much . PETER : Just let them do their job . What if his consciousness changed her physiology ? - A charge that size into her heart ? - They have to do something . NURSE : Three fifty-four . Charged to 360 . [ AS BELL ] Doctor , I 've been jolted once today . If you do it again , you will kill me and the young woman I am living inside of . [ SIREN WAILS ] BROYLES : How could this have happened ? Dr. Bell , you assured me Agent Dunham was perfectly safe . And I believed that she was . With the rats , it was nearly two weeks before I began to see any complications . - What rats ? - My test subjects . When I was first conducting soul-magnet experiments 30 years ago . The rats lasted nearly two weeks before the host 's consciousness got lost . I never anticipated that it would happen more quickly in a human . BROYLES : Wait . Go back . What do you mean , with the rats the host consciousness got lost ? It seems that at a certain point the brain can no longer accommodate two people 's consciousness . So one just went away . And no matter how hard I tried , I was unable to retrieve it . You gave me your word , 48 hours . If you didn 't find a suitable host in 48 hours ... I know what you 're going to suggest , young man . Peter has already said as much . But as much as I may want to , I can no longer simply leave . PETER : And why not ? WALTER : Because at this point your consciousness is the only thing keeping Olivia 's body alive . - That 's right . - How long before Olivia 's gone for good ? Well , I don 't know exactly , but based on what we 've seen thus far I would say no more than a day . If we 're going to get Olivia back , we 're not going to do it here . OLIVIA : Okay , what about this ? What if we try and activate her chi ? - Acupuncture ? - Yes . We try and stimulate her seventh chakra . Pure consciousness . As much as I love the notion , it could take dozens of sessions over several days . You said we had to find a way to pull Olivia out in 24 hours . What if we don 't ? Have to find a way to pull her out , I mean . What are you thinking ? What if instead of trying to find a way to pull Olivia out we try and find a way to go in ? - Peter . - Just saying consider it . We know he has a healthy ego . You don 't start Massive Dynamic without an ego . You really think he would let Olivia die just so he could ... ? He could go on living ? I don 't know . Maybe , maybe not . But on the list of accomplishments for William Bell cheating death would certainly rank number one . OLIVIA : Kids . We think that we have found a way to bring Olivia 's mind back . And to remove William 's . " Whole brain emulation . " It 's another one of Belly 's old projects . It describes how an inorganic host can house organic material . We 're gonna put Belly in a computer . Lots to do and not much time . While we go into Olivia 's mind you can get to work on this . It 's very self-explanatory . Wait . Enter Olivia 's mind how ? We 've done it before when Olivia and Agent Scott shared the dream state . - It 's a simple variation . - Walter ... And as you know , every brain generates a quantifiable electric field . If we can tune ours precisely to Olivia 's , then we can share her mind . - We can go looking for her . - Where do you keep the neuro sensors ? Back shelf by the fish food . I remember you had to put an electromagnetic probe into her brain and dose her with a massive amount of hallucinogenics . Of course ! LSD . That could solve the superego problem . Oh , that is brilliant , son . This may be a weird time to ask , but have you ever tripped ? - Are you suggesting ... ? - Of course ! It 's Olivia 's mind we 're entering . Presumably it will be some maze-like iteration of her psyche . Memories , subconscious . You know her better than anyone . If she is lost in her mind , then we need you to guide us . Astrid ! We need to mix up 2000 milligrams of LSD and we need some sugar cubes , please . WALTER : You first , son . Don 't be nervous . I imagine there are things in this very lab that are as mind-blowing as anything I 've experienced while tripping . Besides , this is merely a conduit to Olivia 's mind and when we get there , we should all be very cogent . Typically , you 'd feel the effects of the drug in 30 to 45 minutes but I 've added an accelerant . You can start to prepare the sedative , dear . I 'll go and help Belly . Peter , don 't worry . I 'll keep my eye on the monitors . I 'll make sure you 're okay . It 's not me I 'm worried about . I 'm pretty sure there 's a good reason why we can 't enter each other 's minds . What if we kick something loose in there ? Right now I think you 're her only hope . [ DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES ] - How 's it coming ? - So far , so good . What ? You 're bald . [ WHISPERS ] I think he 's an Observer . It 's okay , Peter . - Walter , we 're ready . - Oh , good . Bring him over . It 's okay . [ SIGHS ] [ SIGHS ] - Drugs ? - Yep . Lots of them . [ INHALES DEEPLY ] Ooh . [ CHUCKLES ] That tickles . [ HORNS HONKING ] WALTER : Peter ! Peter ! Over here ! I think you 'd better help me down . Whoo ! No , no , no ! Of all the places to grab a man you choose the crotch of my pants . - Hey , I broke your fall . And spared me no embarrassment . You said none of this was real . I said that everything is a product of Olivia 's subconscious . My feelings are most definitely real . - Where 's Belly ? - I have no idea . Must have entered somewhere else . Doesn 't matter . We 're here for Olivia . So , what 's the next step ? There is one , right , Walter ? Please tell me the plan doesn 't end here . Of course not . The plan is to find Olivia and guide her out . We just have to start looking . Walt ... Oh , my God . Walter ! - Amazing , isn 't it ? - How are we supposed to pick Olivia out ? All these people are dressed like her . More likely she equipped them according to her preference . Our fault , I fear . Cortexiphan subjects experience a strong desire to blend in to stay in the background . They were designed that way . - " Designed that way " ? - Peter . - What is that ? WALTER : I believe it 's Morse code . And unless I 'm mistaken , that 's an SOS . [ RUSTLING ] What are you doing ? Chocolate pudding , my favorite . You can 't seriously be thinking about eating right now . Of course not . I just had lunch . - What are you saying ? - I 'm asking who it is . It 's Olivia . She 's found us . Tell her to stay there . We 're on our way . [ MACHINE BEEPING STEADILY ] Any changes ? No . They all seem oddly peaceful . Do you really think it 's possible to upload a person 's consciousness to a computer ? I don 't know . I 'm just following Bell 's instructions . The aim is for the computer to mimic the behavior of neurons . I never understood why Walter was so drawn to licorice . But look at it . The swirl . It 's Bernini 's spiral altar at St. Peter 's . It doesn 't end . Did you clean that up ? Yeah . I thought I 'd help you clear the table . You touched the tray with the sugar cubes ? Sure . Why ? [ ASTRID SIGHS ] Have you ever taken LSD ? The towers are out of proportion . We should be closer by now . It 's Olivia 's mind assigning importance . Our surroundings represent her emotional landscape , don 't forget . Oh . Oh , my . - Olivia 's stepfather . - What ? Where ? Over there . That 's him , Olivia 's stepfather . [ TIRES SCREECH ] PETER : Uh-oh . PETER : Hmm . Walter , I 'm getting a bad feeling about this . Any suggestions ? WALTER : Yes . Run ! Oh ! The cab ! - Wait , wait , wait . You 're driving ? - Okay . What the hell was that ? [ TIRES SCREECHING ] Go , go , go ! Peter , I made a skid . PETER : There , the elevators . - Walter , Peter , hello . - Nina , are you a sight for sore eyes . - We 're looking for Olivia . - Olivia ? We think she 's in an office on the north side . - Walter thinks it 's Bell 's office . - Okay . This elevator is the fastest one . It will take you directly to the private lobby of the upper floors . [ BEEPS ] [ ELEVATOR BELL DINGS ] - Walter ! WALTER : Oh ! [ GRUNTING ] [ NINA SCREAMS ] PETER : Come on . [ ELEVATOR BELL DINGS ] WALTER : Oh ! She tried to kill us . You saw . Why is everyone trying to kill us ? - I don 't like this place . - Me neither . [ ELEVATOR BELL DINGS ] Olivia , are you in there ? [ DOOR HANDLE RATTLING ] Careful , Peter . We don 't know what her mind 's put on the other side of this door . We should be ready for anything . [ DOOR UNLOCKS ] - Belly ? - I lied . Olivia 's not here . I was concerned if you knew it was just me , Peter wouldn 't let you rescue me . Belly , why are you a cartoon ? I 'd ask yourselves the same question . BELL : I found myself on the street , but neither of you were nearby . And then a car tried to run me down . So I came here . I assumed it would be a safe haven . But then I encountered Nina . I don 't understand . If this is all a projection of Olivia 's mind , why is everything turning against us ? When she came to us in the lab , she asked for our help . What I 'm starting to think is that when my mind entered hers her ego became confused , her sense of self . Which , in turn , initiated the darker parts of her subconscious allowing her deepest fears to run rampant . - Explain that . - What we 're saying is that Olivia is not aware that Belly 's consciousness entered hers . As far as she 's concerned , one minute she was fine the next minute she was set adrift in her innermost thoughts . It 's her fears that are causing the siege . Well , in that case , she 's not lost . She 's hiding . That 's what she does . When Olivia is afraid , she retreats . - That 's not good . - And being lost is ? BELL : Yes , it 's better . I expected there to be a logical trail whereby we could track her because Olivia wanted to be found . If she 's hiding , I 'm afraid we 're looking for a needle in a haystack . He 's right . Everything in her mind is dangerous and hostile to her now . How can we expect to find her if she 's frightened of everything , us included ? Because she 'd do exactly what you did . She 'll find a place that she considers to be safe and she 'll hide out . There is an entire world out there with no rhyme or reason . Where would you like to start ? [ BEEPING ] [ FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ] Hey . Hey . I know you said only water but it might be good if you can eat something . But if you want , I can take it away . That 's fine too . Whatever you like . Thank you for this . What you 're feeling right now , it 's just the effects of the LSD . - But it 's temporary . - No . It 's infinite . It 's all around us . [ CHUCKLES ] And you don 't see that . I didn 't see that . But now I know . And I know it followed me . What followed you ? Death . I saw death . All of it . And it was me . [ PANTING ] Can you hold my hand ? Please ? Well , Peter ? The first place I 'd look is Jacksonville . - Jacksonville is the last place she 'd go . - That 's my point . I know Olivia . She knows that 's the last place anybody would look . We only have so much time , Peter . Are you sure ? Yes . Let 's get to Jacksonville . I assume that 's about us . [ DOOR OPENS ] [ GROWLING ] [ ZOMBIES MOANING ] The zeppelin . Peter ! Come on , son ! [ ZOMBIES MOANING ] [ BIRDS SQUAWKING ] We should circumnavigate the currents . I should have known . Should have known what , Walter ? When we were over there , getting Peter back . When we were on that stage . You said goodbye to me . I should have known you had no intentions of dying that day . As long as I 've known you , you 've hated goodbyes . I guess that 's true . I need you , William . I don 't know what to do , about Peter , about the machine about what 's waiting for him for the world , because of what we did . Walter , when we were young and foolish , with too much power and too many dreams that no one could stand in the way of we needed each other . I don 't understand . We needed each other then to check and balance . And now ? Now you possess the wisdom of humility . We didn 't back then . The decisions you make will be the right ones . The direction you choose to take will be just . [ WALTER SIGHS ] [ ALARM BLARING ] What 's that ? Fuel gauge . [ GRUNTS ] How many are up there ? It 's just me . This is a flare gun . You don 't want to get shot with a flare gun . WALTER : Peter . - Walter , stay back . Who are you ? What 's your name ? - Peter . - Peter what ? Peter Bishop . Nice to meet you . Peter ! Peter ! [ WALTER SCREAMING ] Walter ! [ WALTER SCREAMING ] [ WALTER GASPS ] [ RUNNING FOOTSTEPS ] Walter ! You 're here with us . You 're back in the lab . It 's all right . It 's all right . I 'm back . It 's okay . I 'm back . Oh , damn . [ SIGHS ] I 'm back . [ GRUNTS ] BELL : Your father will be fine , Peter . He knows there 's no time to come back . And even if he tried , he would never find us . We 're on our own . Who was that guy ? Someone unpleasant from her past , I imagine . This way . We 'll need to take possession of a vehicle . Do you drive a motorcycle ? I would love to ride on a motorcycle . PETER : Hold on . You 're going the wrong way . I 've got 10 years of experience in Jacksonville . We 're on East Union St. It leads to the Mathews Expressway . To get to the Jacksonville Day Care Center ... She won 't be at the Day Care Center . We need to go that way . I thought you said she was that way . And I thought you said you wanted to travel by motorcycle . BELL : Hmm . WALTER : The computer 's nearly ready to receive Belly 's consciousness . [ BIRD CHIRPING ] WALTER : Hand me those tubes , dear . [ WHISTLING ] They should snap right in . - Damn my hands ! - I 'll get another one . There isn 't another one . I 'll have to modify the ECL82 tube from my phonograph . And I 'll need tinfoil and instant glue and a 60-watt light bulb . And hurry , dear . Where are we going , Peter ? Olivia told me she lived on the military base . Olivia once told me that she sometimes thinks about what it would be like to just be normal . She said she falls asleep sometimes thinking about what it would be like if her life hadn 't have taken the turn that it did . She told me that the last time she remembered feeling that way was the day before she met you and Walter at the Cortexiphan trials . I think she 's down there somewhere . In that house , on that day , hiding out . They 're all the same . How will we find her ? Her real dad painted the door red . He told her that it was good luck . The Army told him it was against regulations but he was an important man , so they let it slide . There aren 't many streets left , Peter . Maybe the door was painted green again after they moved away . It wasn 't . What are you waiting for ? What if I 'm wrong ? What if she 's not in there ? I 've taken us so far off course . You should have thought of that back at the zeppelin . Peter . Olivia . It 's okay . I 'm so afraid . I don 't know what 's happening . There were people trying to hurt me . This was the safest place . I know , and I 'm here to help you . I can 't explain it all right now . But I need you to understand that you 're safe . It 's okay for you to come back . Peter , what 's wrong ? Peter , you 're scaring me . You 're not her . What are you talking about ? This is not you . I can see it in your eyes . It 's not you . I just needed to know it was you . - Olivia ? - People have been tricking me . But I knew the real you would recognize me . Oh , no . [ HEAVY FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ] Run ! BELL : Peter , this way . Peter . [ YELLING ] Peter ! Peter ! Peter ! It 's okay . Calm down , son . Walter , she 's here . I found her . She 's here . I gotta go back , Walter . I gotta go back . They 're gonna get her . - Walter , what do I do ? - Nothing , dear . Nothing . All we can do is wait . It 's up to Belly now . Come on , breathe . In and out . Hey , hey , hey . I lost her . I lost her . Go . No more . I 'm not afraid of you . How ? I suspect I know what has happened here . I think my experiment was right after all . You should have been safe inside your mind . Except it 's you and you have never felt safe . You are your own worst enemy , Olivia . You took the opportunity to let your fears overwhelm you . But you just fought back . In the end , you are as strong as Walter and I always believed you were . And now you know it too . So , what happens now ? Now you go back . But not me . For you to survive , I need to leave . [ THUNDER RUMBLING ] I don 't understand . You don 't have to . [ THUNDER CRASHING ] Well , that 's Walter . Right on time . Please tell Walter that I knew the dog wouldn 't hunt . [ THUNDER CRASHING ] [ THUNDER CRASHING ] Olivia ? [ IN NORMAL VOICE ] Hi . You lie there and rest . One consciousness . One glorious consciousness . What happened to me ? What do you remember ? I remember you . [ CHUCKLES ] And I remember William Bell was there . Walter . It didn 't work . He 's gone . William 's gone . OLIVIA : Walter . I think Bell gave me a message . He said , " Tell Walter that I knew the dog wouldn 't hunt . " Walter , what does that mean ? When we would do experiments he would use that expression when he knew something wouldn 't work . But he suggested the computer . It was his idea . Exactly . He knew he wasn 't coming out . Belly hates goodbyes . Welcome back , Olivia . Thank you . Walter ? I downloaded Zoom for you . [ TV SHOW THEME MUSIC PLAYS FAINTLY OVER SPEAKER ] I can watch it with you if you 'd like . If you don 't mind I 'd just like to be alone for a while longer . Okay . Take your time . [ DOOR CLOSES ] [ SIGHS ] [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] Look better than the last time I saw you . Yeah . It 's amazing what a couple hours will do for a guy . - Hi . Oh . - Hi . - Are you hungry ? - No , I 'm okay , thanks . So how are you feeling ? Um ... Ha . I feel like I 've just woken up from a really strange dream . [ CHUCKLES ] Thank you for coming to get me . It 's not as dangerous as crossing into another universe , but I try . You 're welcome . [ CHUCKLES ] - What will we have to deal with next ? - I don 't know . But for some reason , I 'm not afraid to move forward anymore . - Sure you don 't want some toast ? - No , no , I 'm fine . Who is this guy ? I saw him in your mind . You had him locked up in a zeppelin . He was just flying around , trapped in there . Yeah , I don 't know . I haven 't seen him before . But I think that he 's the man who 's gonna kill me . [ English - US - SDH ]

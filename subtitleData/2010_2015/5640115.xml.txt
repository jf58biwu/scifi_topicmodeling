 Ridiculous . Do I gotta do everything around here ? Three hours to go and the dishes still haven 't been washed . The drink cart hasn 't been loaded up . The kids ' gift bags haven 't been sorted . And did we even get ice ? Hello ! Did we get ice ? Alison , come on . Get with the program here , we need to get moving . Where did you go in the middle of the night , Donnie ? Ah ... I don 't know . Never-never land ? I woke up . You weren 't in bed . Honey , we don 't have time for this . The kids are outside doing God knows what , we got a million things to do and you 're not helping ! Just make a list of what we need and I 'll do it and when I 'm out getting the damn ice . I need to know where you went , Donnie . Look , I know we had a bad day yesterday . A bad day ? Is that what you call it ? Where are you going ? I 'm going out to get the stuff that you were supposed to get yesterday ! I 'm trying to have a conversation with you , Donnie . And oh , what a joy it is ! But don 't worry , honey . I 'm sure we 'll talk about this later . It 's all good . Ah ! My problems didn 't start in the military . They started out of uniform , as a private contractor . Understand ? I 'm not doing any of this by choice . All right . So , they forced you to be Beth 's monitor for two years without even knowing why . Are you some kind of hustler ? You understand leverage , right ? The difference is you chose to infiltrate Beth 's life , to screw her boyfriend right on this counter . And you weren 't even you . And you aren 't you either . I don 't think you understand how serious this is . We need to try and be honest with each other , twin sister . Okay . Let 's see what happens to the results of the medical test you performed on me . I wanted to get you away from that . I 'm serious about Rio . Just tell me what happens to the results . They go to Olivier . From there I don 't know . - What are you doing ? - I 'm gonna take a shower . Wash off the filth . Is that okay with you ? So do you think the results might tell them I 'm not Beth ? I don 't know what the tests are for . I explained that . This is my world , Sarah . It is you that I 'm worried about . Yeah ? What is it that worries you about me ? Whatever it is you 're not telling me . Sarah ? Hey , Cosima , you were right . Paul doesn 't even know about clones . See , it 's a double blind . Um , the monitors are unaware of the purpose of the experiment . That way they can 't skew the results . Oh , hey . I just had to get out of there . I don 't even know where I am going . Right . I may have a monitor dilemma of my own . Um , I 'm new here , this semester . I didn 't bring anybody with me , but , uh , someone wants to be friends . Just stay away from them , Cos . Stick to the science , yeah ? Stick to the science ? What am I , the geek monkey now ? Seriously , Paul 's a bad ass okay . He 's ex-military . If somebody 's trying to get close to you just stay away . Right . The old " do as I say , not as I do . " Sorry ... Look , Alison 's calling through . Are we good ? Sure . Hey ! - I need you . - What 's going on ? Um ... I have a situation . What kind of situation ? Just get over here right now . - Hey that 's not fair ! - Oh , then I 'll get you again . Okay , okay . You 're gonna walk your sister to Aynesley 's house - and you 're gonna stay there . - But Mom ! - Yes . It 's gonna be fun . - No ! Go . Tell her I said it 's okay . Where are you off to , Sarah ? Ah ! Alison ? - Why am I tied to the chair ? - Shh ! Tell me what was really in the box , Donnie . What ? Your special box . What was inside of it ? Are you out of your mind ? Untie me . No . Donnie I have questions that needs answers . Come on , Alison , this is insane ! Don 't worry , honey . It 's all good . Isn 't that what you always tell me ? Think about what you really want to get off your chest . Or what , you 're gonna stick sequins on me ? - You moved the files . - Files ? What files ? Your files that you have on me from your box . Your special box . Ahhh ! Have you lost your mind ? I know what you do , Donnie . - What ? What do I do ? - You spy . You perform medical examinations on me in my sleep . - What ? - You turned my whole life into a big embarrassing lie ! - Oh , no ! - And you switched the files in your special box for porno DVDs ! A Big Boob Blowies ! Ahhh ! - Hey , Delphine . - Hey . - Bonjour Cosima . - I 'm bored . Well , you know , there 's this lecture today that I was going to see ... Wait , where is it ? Um , I was going to . If you want to come with me . Neolutionism . Really ? You 've ... You 've heard of it ? Yeah , it 's like kind of fringe , don 't you think ? Well , I think that , as a Darwinist , it would interest you . And this Dr. Leekie is a really , really , I saw his TED Talk online and ... Whew ! Hmm . So ... Sure . Why not ? Sarah , I can understand why you took off this morning , but I need ... We need to know that the ground beneath us is solid . So , please . Let 's talk about all this tonight . Why do you do it , Donnie ? Alison , I don 't examine you in your sleep . Oh , no . No . Am I sick like the German ? What German ? Who 's German ? Oh , no ! - What the hell is going on , Alison ? - Shh ! Please , no . What are you doing ? Please . Argh ! Alison , no ! Hi . What 's the emergency ? Umm ... You might wanna sit down for this . Uh ... I 'll stand . Thanks . Okay . Alison ? Alison ? - Who 's that ? - Alison . - Donnie . - Who 's Donnie ? He 's my husband . - What ? - I think he 's my watcher . Jesus Christ ! Alison , what have you done ? Al ? Yoo-who ! Hello ? Who 's that ? Oh ! I completely forgot . - Hey . - Oh , you 're not ready for the pot luck . Oh , yeah . Umm ... You 're not even dressed . Well , I was just thinking , could we change venues ? Change venues ? Ali , what 's wrong ? I ... Nothing , I 'm just not ... I think I 'm coming down with something . - I think we should ... - Well , it 's too late now . So just take some of your happy pills and let me help . Don 't worry , we 'll get this party started . Okay . - What 's up , Hendrix ? - Mmm ! Hello , hi . Hi . - Is this a pajama party ? - Good . - Ali . - Hmm . - Nothing 's ready . - Oh , I know . Cover for me . - What 's all off limits ? - Hmm . The basement . Uh , it 's a disaster . - Donnie 's starting renos this week . - Oh ! Mmm-hmm . Well , the kids are screaming for chips . I 'll go get some from the pantry . - Sausage rolls , freezer . - Got it . Okay . - A pot luck ? Seriously ? - Seriously . - Okay , you got to kick them out . - I can 't , back out of the monthly pot luck . It 's my turn . And I have no gift bags , no ice , and no bartender because my husband is tied to a chair . Alison , you need to take a deep breath . - I hate yoga . - Okay . You need to go up there and just play hostess like nothing 's wrong . Fine . You interrogate Donnie . - What ? - Yes . You are the expert . Go in there and then get that lying bastard to confess . - What ... Are you serious ? - Be me . Put this on . What if he 's just your husband ? Sarah , I need you to help me with this . I impersonated you , in front of your daughter . Now it 's your turn . With a golf-club ? No . No , I can 't bartend . I 've got a very handsome guest here . Please tell me you 're not with the morgue attendant again . No , but I plan to be . Hang on . Teddy , is that all you can handle ? All right . Looks like my afternoon just opened up . Okay . How soon can you be here ? - To Scarberia ? - Yeah . - And dress suburban . - You 've got to be joking . I know , it sucks to be my sister . Don 't forget the ice . Well ! Okay . Kids are looking for the gift bags . And we 're running out of wine glasses . Where are your disposables ? They are under the sink . No . Uh , top shelf , left hand side of the stove . I don 't know . I don 't know . What 's going on downstairs ? - Sausage roll ? - No , thanks . So ... Meera wants to know the name of your contractor . Oh ! I will give you his info . - Perfect . - Okay . Sausage ? No , okay . That 's all right . She 's drunk already ? Whoopsie-whoo ! Red chili . Did you want one ? And where the hell 's Donnie ? Hello , Donnie . Donnie . Hello , Donnie . - Alison . - Shh ! - Can we stop now , please ? - Yes . After a few questions . You told me yesterday she was fine . She 's right back in her dark place , Olivier . Stopped her from OD-ing on pills last night . She 's quit the force , dumped her therapist . She has no one else . She has you to share in this crisis like any other event . Don 't interfere unless it 's critical . I need to know that I won 't be blamed if she tries it again . If I can 't stop her . You 've done well for us , Paul . A long as your subject makes her own choices there are no wrong decisions . Yes ? Then , so long as you 're on . I know , Donnie . So you can ... Tell me how it works . How what works ? The double blind . Monitoring . Alison , would you listen to yourself ? I got up in the middle of the night to watch cricket ! Cricket ? The South African games start at 4 : 00 a.m. Is there nothing in my life left unexamined by you ? Now take off the GD blindfold ! The whole neighborhood is here ? What kind of irrational nonsense is going through that head of yours ! Hey , watch your tone , Donnie . Alison , get your frazzled PMS shit together ! Hey ! You watch your tone ! Your wife is the rock of this family . You will no longer speak down to her . Am I clear ? Yeah . - Cosima ? Hey . - Hey . - I am so glad you came . - Mmm-hmm . You won 't be disappointed . Yeah , I can tell . Yeah . Dr. Leekie attracts diverse thinkers . - Come . - Okay . Oh . Neolution , a philosophy of today for tomorrow . Rooted in our past , in the evolution of the human organism . But before we go to the future , let me take you back 3,000 years , to the great , Greek philosopher , Plato , and his twilight years . Poor old Plato was going blind . Going lame and losing his hearing . Now , imagine if he knew we could correct his sight , restore his hearing and replace his ailing body parts with titanium ones . Plato would have thought we were gods . But we 're not . We 're just fundamentally flawed human beings . Your glasses , for example , make you somewhat , um ... Platonic . But within the very near future , I 'll be able to offer you the ability to see into a spectrum never before seen by the naked eye . Infrared , X-rays , ultraviolet . - You interested ? - Maybe I 'll just start with basic LASIK . And so you should . That 's making an evolutionary choice . Neolution gives us the opportunity at a self-directed evolution . And I believe that 's not only a choice but a human right . Oh , Felix , Felix , Felix . All right , Felix . Time to party with the party . Hello . Oh , shit ! I totally thought you were Alison . Have you looked in the mirror ? There 's a thing on your head . Shit , as they say , it 's completely sideways , Fe . What do you need ? - Crackers . - Hmm . - What ? - Do you have any crackers ? How should I know , Charity ? Why don 't you go check the cracker cupboard . Alison . Meera is talking . Where is Donnie ? Oh , my God . Why isn 't he helping you with this ? He 's tied up . Ali , don 't you dare cover for him . Not again and not to me . - Hmm . - You know what I 've been going through with Chad . - Hey , ladies . - Incoming . I am all over those sexy stretches . You 've been working your glutes again . What 's your program ? Why is everybody asking me so many goddamn questions ? Hello , neighbors . Your bartender 's here . I 'm just gonna have a quick word with our hostess and then I 'm gonna be right back to , uh , top you up . Yeah ? Let 's go . It 's a gay bartender , that 's awesome . Chad , shut your stupid mouth and feed the kids . No . - Oh . - What the ... I screwed up , didn 't I ? It 's not Donnie . He said he didn 't ... It 's not him . But I whacked him and it felt so good . Is he really in there ? Yeah , tied to a chair . Oh , my God . Okay . I 'll go handle the mess upstairs . Right . I tortured my husband . I messed up my family . And you 're the only person I can talk to and you 're just another version of me . Come on . I 'm a horrible person . I 'm not even a real person . Of course you are . Look , you stood up to all this so far . Mmm . Mmm-mmm-mmm . Alison . Donnie says that he got up in the middle of the night to watch cricket . - Cricket ? - Yeah . Look , Paul 's military . He 's a professional . You 've known Donnie since what ? High school . Right . High school . Yeah . So how could he be your monitor ? So he 's just Donnie ? Eating , farting Donnie ? My monitor is probably one of those bitches upstairs . Alison , just ... Alison ! I know . I know . Okay . No . No , no . Neolution is not eugenical . Okay , so what is it ? Is it utopian ? Neotopian maybe ? Cosima . Oh , my God , look . There he is . I would just love to meet him . Come on . Okay . Don 't worry . Go . - Hello . - Hi . Uh ... Oui . You speak French ? Oui . I have a neuro-lingual chip . Bullshit . Good . A skeptic . Neural implants are something we 're exploring however . At the DIAD Institute . - You 've heard of us . - Yes . Um , are they from the DIAD Institute ? Oh , my " freaky-Leekies " as they 've been dubbed in the media . It was once asked what my perfect human would look like . I offhandedly suggested silver-gray hair and one white eye . Little did I know ... Well , I enjoyed your lecture very much . Oh , thank you so much , thank you . You know , I 'm in immunology . Hmm . And you ? Um , evo-devo . So whenever somebody talks about the future I always say , " Show . Don 't tell . " I hope you 'll give me the chance . Please , have a look at our work at DIAD . Adieu . You are such a brat . No ! Come on , let 's get out of here . Come on . Hmm . Alison . Want a pint of Chablis ? It 's me , Fe . Oh , shit , sorry , I 'm ... - Code red , Alison just went down in a heap . - No . We need to get her life out of the fire somehow . Okay , listen . I think that I may have spotted her real monitor . - What ? - Yeah . - There you are . - Here I am . What is with you ? Hendrix ! - Hey ! - Nobody finds that funny , Chad . Oh , oh , easy . Just bouncing quarters here . Um , I 've seen you before . Do you work at the plaza ? I don 't do plazas . Oh . How do you two know each other ? Oh , um , because ... - He 's , uh ... - I 'm ... I 'm her acting coach . Felix . Aynesley , from across the street . You didn 't tell me you were getting professional training , Ali . Really ? Hmm . Um , Aynesley , do you want red or white ? So , um , what do you think ? Um ... You run so fast . - Did we lose them ? - Yes ! Okay , so let 's , uh , steal some bikes . - Oh , no , no , no , that 's too much crime for me . - Oh , come on . I have a class to TA . Oh , okay . All right . You know what 's a very French thing to do ? - What ? - After a jogging like this , we like to smoke a nice little cigarette . - Did you say , " a jogging " ? - Yes . You did . Okay , just checking . Do you smoke ? Do you want one ? - Uh , no , just pot for me . - Mmm . Ooh , really ? - Yes , I 'm from San Fran so ... - Ooh . - I am gonna get you so baked one day . - Mmm . Okay . One day . Okay . It 's , um ... It 's really nice to make a friend in the brave new world . - Yeah . - I have to go . Okay , yeah . - Okay . - Ciao . Bye . Ciao . Donnie . Sweetie . Um , I 'm so sorry about all this . Please untie me . I can 't until the party 's over . I bought mulled wine . If I can help ... While you 're down here , I want you to really think about us . What we 've got with our house and our kids . You don 't wanna lose that . No . That is a really good look on you . - Yeah ? - You need to come upstairs , now . What 's wrong ? Vic is here . - Vic ? - Yeah . Hi , Sarah . If you don 't come upstairs I 'm gonna start making friends fast . Okay , fine , uh ... Not downstairs . Upstairs bedroom . Two minutes . Beth . Mmm . No scar . Sarah . Are you Sarah ? Mmm . Alison . You want some of this ? Come to bed with me . Look at all this shit . Whoa ! A stroller and a latte , and you could even fool me . You have five seconds , Vic . Oh , yeah , or what ? You gonna call neighborhood watch ? - Neighborhood watch ! - Hey , hey ! Keep your voice down . You and I have unfinished business . Sit . So . You faked your own death so you can move on to your new scam , hmm ? Where are you now , Sarah ? Sarah , it must be so confusing . You have no idea . You 've got your money , Vic . And then some . Five measly grand doesn 't cover my finger . Or my " pain and suffering " . Whatever this scam , I want a cut , or I 'm gonna blow your whole charade wide open . Let 's move this along . Yeah ? What 's it gonna take ? Look at them . Hey ! Could 've been our kids . You got the wrong room , pal . You must be Vic . - Yeah , and you are ? - Oi , hey , this is none of your business . Am I talking to you ? Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . What 's she done this time ? Ah , Sarah , Sarah , Sarah . Hey , she works for me . You talk to me . Oh , yeah ? Is that right ? - Whoa . - Hey , Vic . - Whoa , whoa . Okay . - Right , turn around . Turn around . Put your hands up . What do you want , Vic ? Sarah and I have unfinished business . I want a cut of the play . I 'm the taxman . Can 't you see we 're right in the middle of it ? I appreciate that . Got a whale on the line . So , can we go somewhere else before someone walks in ? Talk out in the garage ? Vic . Okay , after you two . Uh ... Ali , can we talk ? Excuse us , ma 'am , but you can talk inside . - No , no , no , no , no . - We got this , Alison . Alison . Who was that ? Which one ? The impossibly handsome one , obviously . Oh , a friend from university . College . Oh , God , Ali , I know you 're sick of hearing about Chad . Uh , no . I think the asshole is having another affair . Slowly . Let 's go . Uh-huh , move . Sit on the chair . Let 's go , buddy , come on . Go , sit ! Let 's stand . I 'm not gonna hurt you ... It 's that slut from spinning class . After he swore he 'd never do it again . Are people talking ? Has he said anything to Donnie ? No . No , not a word . Um , but every marriage has its little secrets . We all have them . I 'm sorry . I know you and Donnie are going through things , too . Hmm ? College friend ? I 've ... I should get back to the party . Your shirt . What ? You 've changed your shirt since the party started . Oh . One of the kids must have spilt something on it . One of the kids . I should get back to the kitchen . You 're acting very strange . I 'm gonna get to the bottom of it . What do you want , man ? - Huh ? - I want you to tell me everything about her . About Sarah ? What 're you gonna do with that ? Huh ? What 're you gonna do with that , buddy ? What 's her last name ? Manning . Sarah Manning . She have a twin sister ? What ? No , she doesn 't have a twin . She 's an orphan . You know Beth or Alison ? Who ? Listen , buddy , calm down , okay ? I 'm not trying to shake you down . I 'm in love with her . I do crazy things for her ... Calm down , man ! All right , calm down , buddy . Close the door , Sarah Manning . Paul , he doesn 't have anything to do with this . It 's true , man , I swear to God , listen to her . Who 's the woman on the couch inside ? Look , he doesn 't know anything . Why is her husband tied to a chair ? Listen , man , I swear to God , I don 't know anything . Sarah , could you please tell him ? Could you please call him off ! Could you call this guy off ! - Be a man , Vic ! - I don 't know . All right . Okay , I 'm a man . You are putting me in a very precarious position , Sarah . Can 't have any loose ends with this thing . This guy seems like a very loose end . He doesn 't know anything , Paul ! Look , man , I don 't wanna die , all right ? Just calm down , please , man . Hey , Paul , I 'll explain everything . Beth , Alison , I 'll tell you what 's going on . Just let him go . I swear to God I 'm not gonna say a word , all right ? Not one word . Sarah , can you please do something , God damn it ? Look , look , I 'll be honest with you , Paul .

Watch your feet , Ali . Oh . It 's fine . Don 't worry about it . Move . You and me end here , Vic . Never come back . Sarah , wait a minute . Alison , uh , I just came ... Did you fly down here ? - What ? - I literally just put you to bed . I ... I got up . Oh . We still haven 't met . I 'm Aynesley from across the street . And you 're ... Just visiting . Um , like I said , every marriage has its little secrets . This one 's between consenting adults . No one gets hurt . Um ... Do you know what ? You 're right . This is none of my business . Time to go home . Donnie . About my little , um , - breakdown , um ... - No . No , no , no . It 's my fault . You 're right . You are the rock of this family . I 'm so sorry . Of course you knew . It wasn 't just porn in my special box . You remember Ginny Neusbaum ? From college ? I don 't know how to say this ... But she and I had an affair once . Okay , twice . But you and I were broken up . We traded letters for a few years after it ended . Dirty talk , mostly . Then she got lupus and I never heard from her again . She got lupus ? I don 't know what happened to her . I 'm so sorry . I was just trying to hold on to something personal . Something ... I 'm sorry . Drink ? Yeah . Talk . Clones . Well , we don 't use the C-word . That 's Alison 's rule . But , yeah , we 're genetic identicals . Not triplets ? Genetic identicals ? Yeah , we count nine of us so far . That 's what you do , Paul . That 's why you were watching Beth . You monitor human clones . You should have just told me that in the first place . Stay away from me . I have an offer for you . You have until midnight . If there was a club here don 't you think I 'd know about it ? Beth 's paperwork is a mess . It 's like she 's never done it before . So let 's get forensics to pull the hand . Run a fresh set of prints . All right , you gotta see this . The subject isn 't who we think she is . She 's an impostor . Help make this right , Afghanistan goes away . I can tell you have a very unique perspective , Cosima . - She 's very cheeky . - Mmm-hmm . But that 's why I like her . Detective Mark Bell . I need to talk to you about Beth Childs .

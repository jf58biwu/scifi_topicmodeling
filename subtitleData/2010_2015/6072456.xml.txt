 Previously on Defiance ... I wish to conduct business with your spymaster . So what do you want from the Votanis Collective ? Defiance exists in a state of ongoing political flux . And what direction do you envision ? Away from the Earth Republic . I am going to tell your husband everything . This will end very badly for you . Drink it . All of it . Now . The poison was on the flask . I keep telling myself that I 'm just holding down the fort for Kenya , but all along I have this terrible feeling that she 's ... Dead ? I 've done terrible things . What terrible things ? She 'll wake up . They always do . I made a deal with something . It said it was a God , but now I 'm not so sure . You shot yourself in the head . More like the neck . Barrel slipped . I taught you better than that . Don 't do that again . I deserved to die . Hey ! Stop talking like that . Anyway , you didn 't . Irzu won 't let me die . Will you stop that ? This thing inside you , it doesn 't come from Irzu or any other kind of God . How do you know ? Because I do , okay ? Because there 's no such thing as magic . It 's Arktech . It 's Indogene nanorobots or some such thing like that . It 's science and it can be fixed with science . And I don 't trust that Doc Yewll , but maybe we can find a decent doctor at Cedars . You 're wrong . I 'm never wrong . You 're always wrong . I 'm occasionally wrong , but my heart 's always in the right place . I wish that was enough . That thing . That kid , Irzu . Is she here right now ? She 's inside me . Yeah ? Can she hear me ? You . In there . Irzu , or the Kaziri , or Robby the Robot , whatever you wanna call yourself , you leave my little girl alone . Now . Or I will come in there , I will force you out and I will take you apart . That make you feel better ? A little bit . Viceroy Mercado . What does he want ? Nolan . What 's going on ? Ah ! Yeah . Come here , fella . Mahsuvus Gorath , you 're under arrest for collusion with the Votanis Collective . That 's a lie . For acts of terrorism and espionage against the Earth Republic . This makes no sense . You got him ? Yes , sir . Hey . What 's going on ? Your boy Mahsuvus is a Votanis Collective spy . He 's using his job as night porter as a cover . So ? Since when are we political ? The Collective has planted a bomb somewhere in New York City that 's gonna detonate in the next 12 hours . Oh , my God . Mahsuvus is a conduit between Brazil and the operatives in New York . He knows the plan , the players and the location . Now he 's gonna tell us . One way or another . Hello ? Amanda Rosewater ? Yes , who is this ? Free Mahsuvus Gorath from Earth Republic custody , or your sister dies . What ? Disobey us and she dies . Tell anyone about us ... Well , you get the picture . Who is this ? I am the man holding a gun to your little sister 's head . Amanda ? Amanda ? Don 't do anything this son of a bitch says ! Kenya ? Kenya ? Madam Mayor . Are you sure the bomb is real ? We intercepted the schematics . It 's a dirty nuke , what they used to call a suitcase bomb . What we don 't have is its specific location . And that is where our friend in the box comes in . And you have evidence that he works for the Collective ? We floated a bogus transmission . And he bit . I 've been his boss for the better part of a year . His tolerance for intense pain makes him one of my more popular night porters . Torture 's not gonna work . We don 't have a choice . 49,000 men , women and children live in Manhattan Valley . There 's no safe way to evacuate and even if there was , where would we put them ? New York is surrounded by ocean and raiders . Have you considered a soft pitch ? Let him think he 's safe . I 'll play the loyal boss . Send me in with a solicitor . We 'll threaten legal action . You 'll release him into my custody , but I 'll be wearing a wire . What is your interest in Mahsuvus ? He 's a Votanis Collective spy , and I want to save as many people as possible . Well , that 's very admirable , but we will handle this our way . Of course . State your name for the record . Forgive me , but I 'm still unclear as to what exactly your interest with me is . Am I under arrest ? No , ma 'am . Favi . Apologies . Favi . But where are my manners ? Congratulations on your promotion , Deputy LaSalle . Corporal . And it 's more of a career change . Now , how long have you known Mahsuvus Gorath ? I 'm afraid I don 't know him . Really ? Because we have witnesses that saw you visit the prisoner on several occasions . My husband was incarcerated . As you say , a woman has needs . And were those needs spy-related ? Miss Rainer . Captain ... Rainer . My life here in Defiance has never been more prosperous . In large part due to the stability that the Earth Republic provides . Why would I take action against them ? Because playing both sides would be a good strategy . Oh , perhaps you 're right . I should consider that . Have you ever given scrip to the Votanis Collective ? I like to acquire scrip , not give it away . You were there when the lawkeeper saved my life , weren 't you ? Yes , I was . Nolan , such a unique man . There 's a certain air about him . Leather , bourbon , gun grease . I 'm sorry , but I really don 't know what this has to do with our investigation . Not a thing . It 's simply that Miss ... Captain Rainer wears it well . She 's good at being a gangster , but she 's not a spy . We 'll keep an eye on her , but Mahsuvus' client list was deep . Nolan ? Are you two dating ? God , no . We 're just having lots of sex . You know I 'm not going to give you the information that you want . Yeah , I figured . I can 't stop trying , though . You know that . I know . You do . It 's not personal . No hard feelings . If our positions were reversed , I would have the shrill drilling through your arm . You know my daughter 's Irathient . Am I supposed to care ? Common ground . I also know you send half your paycheck home to your two kids in Brazil . You 'd do anything for ' em , right ? You 're breaking my heart . Human father , Irathient daughter . Just saying anything 's possible . You and me , Mahsuvus , we decide what kind of world they inherit . Now , I 'm not saying that I 'm carrying any water for the E-Rep . If you ask me , they 're a bunch of puffed-up clowns who 'd be funny if they weren 't armed to the teeth . But there 's a lot of innocent folks living in New York City . And your people hit ' em with a nuke , humans will never forget it . You 're setting up everybody south of the Armistice Line to be a target for retaliation , including your kids . Now , is that what you want for them ? War makes us all monsters , does it not ? War 's over , pal . Nobody won . You know at the Battle of Defiance , we lay down our arms . The soldiers decided to end the war . The soldiers were the ones who decided not to follow orders that didn 't make any sense anymore . I like you , Nolan . Perhaps in a different life , we could 've been friends . Doubt that , pal . But I might have been persuaded to buy you a drink . Mahsuvus Gorath , where 's the bomb ? What time is it scheduled to detonate ? I have nothing to tell you . Where is the bomb ? What time is it scheduled to detonate ? So it shall be until the Arkrise ! How 's his heart ? Strong as a bell beast . We 're clear to go again . All right . Listen , I need more time . Once your man moves into lock-up , I 'll be able to get him out of town . That isn 't fast enough . Look , he 's strapped to a chair in the middle of a guarded building right now . You didn 't give up that easily when you were hijacked on that land coach . How did you know that ? Tell her . Tell your sister . He claims to have his people everywhere . Ask him how his V.C. managed to sneak a bomb through border security into New York and yet they can 't manage to boost Mahsuvus themselves ? 'Cause maybe he isn 't man enough . Maybe none of his people are . Are you looking to die ? Kenya , don 't . If it 's gonna save a city full of innocent people , I think you should shoot me . Do not hurt her . Go ahead . Do it . Do it ! Get to work . I can keep going at him , but I 'm telling you now , this guy , not gonna break . We 're done asking politely . EGO extraction ? It is the only way . Have Pottinger recalled from the Dakota Reach ? Do make sure the findings from the prisoner 's procedure are couriered back to my office for immediate decryption . Of course , sir . What do you mean by EGO extractions ? I have a history with egos . A bad history . A dozen state-of-the-art EGO devices will suck the information right out of his mind without all of that shrill unpleasantness . That could kill him . Oh , it will kill him . Oh , it 's you . Expecting someone else ? In the wake of the bomb threat I heard the Earth Republic was interrogating the usual suspects . You heard right . I was questioned . You ? They came to you ? Yes . And not me ? That 's disrespectful . Put your vanity aside . We have a serious problem . They 're planning to pluck every dirty secret from the head of Mahsuvus Gorath . They can torture Mahsuvus until the Arks rise . He 'll give them nothing . He won 't have a choice . Giemo has learned that they brought in an EGO extraction unit . Well , I have nothing to hide . I know Mahsuvus has been helping you supply Rafe McCawley with weapons to use against the Earth Republic . Mercado will know too . They 'll throw me back in Reverie . Actually , I should think they 'll execute you . And Rafe . And me . Well , you had no part in this . A nuance likely lost on the viceroy . Oh , I will see Mercado flayed like a river otter before I allow him or anyone else to hurt you . That 's good to hear . Don 't be complacent , love . It may simply be that killing you is a pleasure I have reserved for myself . My life is in your hands . That 's my property . I better get it back . Hey , hey , hey . Please just step back . Come on . Let us do our job . Nice uniform , E-Rep . Yeah , it 's a good fit . Nolan , I need to talk with you . What is it ? Kenya 's alive . I ... I talked to her . I heard her voice . The V.C. have her . I have to deliver Mahsuvus alive or they 're gonna kill her . Amanda , are you clean ? Oh , come on . I haven 't touched adreno in weeks . This is real , Nolan . Kenya 's alive . Now time is running out . And I 've been working on a plan to free Mahsuvus . But I need your help . No , Mahsuvus is staying right where he is . What 's he got coming , he brought on himself . That is not the deal , Nolan . If Kenya is alive , then I 'm gonna bring her home to you . Give me your hailer . What ? Amanda , you said it yourself . You 're running out of time . Give me your hailer , please . So what 's the plan ? Someone 's trying to extort Amanda . Claims to be holding Kenya prisoner . And you believe that ? Given what I 've been seeing lately , anything 's possible . So our hailers are now tied to Amanda 's . Blackmailer calls her , we get pinged . Hailers only have a limited range , so ... We triangulate it . Exactly . I 'm gonna head out to Cuthbert Ridge . You stay here and available . Lots of sabrewolves out there . Let me go . No . No way . No , you need to stay put until we get a handle on whatever it is that 's happening with you . I want you safe in Defiance . I 'm not safe anywhere . Yeah , okay , but ... And I can 't be killed . Okay , but ... And Amanda needs you here . What do you need ? The keys would be nice . Be careful . I know you will not fail me . You do yourself a disservice by warning him . Your opinions are , as always , welcome . We will not stand for reconciliation . We ? The men . We stood up to Datak . And I am very grateful for that . He would forgive you and Alak . Us , he would kill . We risked our lives taking your side . A decision for which every new day can be considered its own reward . Eat . Hello ? Hello ? No . No , no , no . I 'm not here to hurt you . You should be . No , no , no , no , don 't ! Who will save you now ? You can gut me if you want , but I won 't die . Everything dies . I 'm not everything . I know your smell . Why ? I have visions . That 's what brought me here . That 's what brought you here . You and I , we 're alike . No ! When I resist the hunger , I see a ship , The Kaziri , crashing into Earth . Then I wake up , standing over my victim . It 's terrifying . I understand . I am a monster . No . You aren 't killing people . They wake up and they 're okay , perfectly fine . How ? How can you know that ? 'Cause I 'm the one who attacked you in AngelArc . I 'm the one who started it all . I 'm working as fast as I can . Amanda , don 't do it . I got away . It 's Kenya . Keep her talking . Kenya ? Kenya , where are you ? Tell me what 's around you . What do you see ? I don 't know . Uh , I see a roller . Um , I see a greenhouse , um , metal frames , plastic tarps . Uh ... I don 't know . Do you see any roads ? Just one . It 's headed west . Amanda ? I missed you so much . I missed you too . I 'm gonna come get you , I promise . Okay . Okay . Okay . Kenya ? Kenya ? I sincerely hope you 're half as resourceful as your sister . I 'm going with you . Kenya will want me there . Come on , kid , pick up . What happened ? She 's not answering . We need three points to get a fix . Where is she ? I wish I could tell you . I can 't waste any more time . I need to get him out . And then what , hmm ? New York gets destroyed ? Kenya comes home , but Amanda goes to jail ? One person 's life is not worth a thousand . What if you got the call ? And it was your little girl ? That 's a decision I hope I never have to make . I can 't let you do something crazy , Amanda . You 're right . I 'm sorry . No need to apologize . Come on , I got some V.C. in ... Like I said , I 'm sorry . Of everyone in this world , why come after me ? I don 't know . I have a vision of myself as a child . She calls herself Irzu . She tells me who to choose . My girl , she calls herself Rayetso . She told me to leave AngelArc . She made me abandon my family . Led me all the way out here . Why ? I don 't know . But you are the one that did this to me . You have to know . I 'm sorry . No , wait . He 's with us . Little Wolf . Somehow I knew I 'd find you here . Who are they ? I don 't know . Oh . Amanda ! Hey , pudding , what are you doing here ? I tried getting in touch with you , but you were busy at the interrogation center . So , you decided to break in and burgle my medicine cabinet . Crafty . Listen , Doc , I 'm at my wits ' end here . Tranquilizers . A couple of my porters are still shaken up by the raid . They need to , you know ... Un-clench ? Yes . Now if you 'll excuse me , I 'll be heading back . Don 't lie to me . You need help . You 're an addict . Come back tomorrow once all this EGO business blows over . I 'll put you on withdrawal meds . Start you on a program . What the hell , Treasure Doll ? Someone took my things . Where are they ? Come on . Where 's my stuff ? Where 's what ? My uniform . My gun . They 're gone ? I 'm supposed to escort the prisoner . I can 't do that in my underwear . They must be here somewhere . Time for a walk down memory lane , traitor . Easy , Sergeant . What 's about to happen to him is awful enough . At least give him some dignity . I 'll go tell Yewll we 're on our way . I 'll go start up the roller . It 's his heart . I 'll get him inside to a med kit . Go take point out front . Roger that . Amanda . What are you doing ? I 'm your ticket out of here . There 's a roller waiting two streets away . We need to hurry . My sister . You were gonna kill my sister . How long have you had her ? Where did you find her ? I swear by Irzu I had no knowledge of this . Oh , and let me guess , you don 't know anything about the bomb , either . Jesus , Mahsuvus . I don 't want this any more than you do . I 'm a spy , not a terrorist . Then why ? Kenya is not the only one being used as strategic leverage . I have a family . Well , I bet they 're proud . That 's far enough ! Nolan , no , please . Don 't do this . I 'm not gonna let him blow up New York , not even for Kenya . Here 's what 's going to happen , friend . I get back to Brazil . I make sure my kids are safe . Then maybe you could buy me that drink . You and I both know that 's not gonna happen . Nolan . Amanda , move . No ! My people will keep their word , Lawman . She must do as they say . Stand down , both of you . I have to save my sister . Please . Done . No . No . Down . Come on . No . No , no , no . Where ? Where ? Come on . Where ? Union Station . Mag ... Mag-Lev platform . Westbound . Track Two . Oh . Berlin , Union Station . Mag-Lev line . Westbound . Track Two . Go ! Go ! Kenya 's dead . And they 're gonna kill her . Amanda . And it 's your fault . It 's your fault . Come on . Come on . She needed me . She needed me . She needed me . She needed me . She needed me . Shh . Answer it . Mahsuvus is dead . Yeah , but he doesn 't know that . Answer the hailer . We 're gonna get Kenya back . Hello ? You had me worried . Where 's my sister ? She 's close . Where 's Mahsuvus ? Get out . Pull the hood . Easy . Show me his face . I did what you asked . Show me his face . - Did you hit him ? - Stay down . He 's got backup . I 'm gonna take a closer look . Body armor . Kenya ? Kenya , I 'm here . Kenya . Hey , come on . Come on . Gonna be okay . Amanda ? Amanda ? Kenya ? Kenya . Did they die ? Did everybody in New York die ? No . No , no , no , no . Everything 's okay . - Yeah ? - Yeah . Everything 's gonna be just like it was . I didn 't ask for this . The honor is not in being asked , but in being ... Chosen , I get it . This is where it will begin . Where what will begin ? Arkrise .

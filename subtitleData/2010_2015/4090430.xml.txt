 [ Wedeck ] On October 6th , the planet blacked out for two minutes and 17 seconds . The whole world saw the future . Forget what we saw . We 're here and I don 't want to waste any more time . I 've been keeping a secret from you . Keiko . She 's in Los Angeles . [ Woman ] Keiko Arahida ! Your mom has posted your bail . This ring is a Quantum Entanglement Device . This little thing prevents people from blacking out ? - Hellinger wants to help you . - Who 's Hellinger ? - Hellinger 's our boss . - You 're going to die . But your daughter 's gonna be better off when you 're gone . [ Grunts , yells ] They had me install a piece of software . I can find out who made it and where it came from . You get me into NLAP , I 'll tell you who caused the blackout . Janis , this guy has been lying to us about everything . Now you want to take him to NLAP ? How the hell do you trust this guy ? Her heart has stopped beating . She 's gone . [ Sobs ] No , no . You do the math . You 're both part of the equation . Both of you . I cannot be in that house with you tonight . At 10 : 00pm , you have to be here with me . [ Mark ] On April 29th , I 'm gonna be on a bender , so why not start now ? Today 's the day Daddy 's gonna die . [ Man speaking indistinctly over PA ] [ Firecrackers sputtering ] Why are we stopping , Mom ? Because we 're just gonna sit here for a while . OK . Oh , wow , look ! - That one 's shaped a star ! - Yeah . - Look at that , Mom ! - Yeah . [ Man speaking indistinctly over PA ] [ Both speaking in Japanese ] I 'm looking for a Keiko Arahida . I believe she 's being held here ? Was . She was released an hour ago . Um ... - Did she say where she was going ? - Not in English . Do you have a phone number for her ? There 's gotta be some sort of intake file , right ? You got a warrant , officer ? Listen , this Keiko , I 've never met her . But I saw her in my flash forward . I started drawing her . I have 20 canvasses in my house of her . She was wearing this T-shirt of a sushi restaurant just outside of Tokyo . So I flew to Japan . I flew to Japan because of a T-shirt . But I didn 't find her . I didn 't find her and I thought that was my only shot . I know that she 's here , in LA . And now , maybe , you have a phone number . She changed my life . Just because I saw her . - That was really your flash forward ? - Yeah . It was . That 's amazing because in my flash forward , [ whispers ] I had a hundred dollars in my pocket . And I couldn 't figure out for the life of me how it got there . [ Breathes heavily ] This isn 't right . I saw her alive . So did you . I saw her alive . OK . - A pulse ? - Yes . Very faint . Stay with me , Tracy . I 'm begging you . - Stay strong . - OK . Stay with me , Tracy . Come on . Stay with me . Tracy , live and we 'll wind up where we 're supposed to be . That 's it . The La Honda Access Point . This is mile six of the accelerator 's ten mile length . We get in there , I can get to the mainframe , find the software Hellinger 's men had me install , and use it to destroy them . You 'll use it to help us identify them . Right . That 's the deal . One of us needs to get this device close to the security guard 's access card . Then , it 'll transmit its code to my cell phone . [ Demetri ] Oh , OK . We 'll just get the rig close to the security guard that we 're trying to completely avoid . That sounds simple . Good stuff , Simon . This is gonna get us inside the gate . This is gonna get us inside everything . I know you don 't trust him . I trust you . If you 're here , I 'm here . [ Shudders ] - What 's the matter ? What 's going on ? - I don 't know . Something 's not right . I think I did it back in my apartment . - [ Demetri ] We 're going to the hospital . - [ Janis ] We have to do this tonight . - We 're not gonna get a second chance . - [ Demetri ] Janis . The FBI 's not gonna let him near that machine . Catching whoever is behind the blackout is more important than anything else . I need to do this . Please . Do it for me . [ Door buzzes ] - Stan ... - Don 't tell me I won 't regret doing this . I already do . Let 's go . [ Wedeck ] Your snapping on Hellinger like that ... I take some responsibility . I let it happen . What the hell are you talking about ? We were so focused on finding when the next blackout is , I haven 't seen what 's been going on with you . [ Sirens blaring ] Yeah , I 've been meaning to talk to you about your priorities lately . - [ Chuckles ] - [ Cell phone rings ] Wedeck . [ Man ] Sir , we 've found two bombs in the FBI with timers . - There are probably more . - [ Wedeck ] Call in the Bomb Squad . I 'm on my way . Guess you 're coming with me . [ Tires screech ] - [ Clanks ] - [ Car horn sounds ] Hands on the wheel . Hands on the wheel . Get out of the car , slow . Slow ! - I need help ! - [ Man ] Ma 'am , what are you doing here ? [ Beeping ] [ Whispering ] What 's taking so long ? Well , she has to get the reader closer . Trying to find Pacific State Hospital on Old La Honda . - Ma 'am ? Ma 'am ? - [ Panting ] Ma 'am ? - [ Beeping ] - [ Door buzzes ] [ Simon whispers ] Come on ! [ Demetri ] Wait . That looked real . I think she 's hurt . I need an ambulance at La Honda Access Point . [ Simon ] He 's getting her to a hospital . Come on . [ Man ] La Honda Access Point . [ Charlie ] We should be home now . It 's almost 10 : 00 . - [ Waves crashing ] - Mm-hmm . Well , we 're not . So , then ... things can change ? Mm-hmm . Dylan ! - What are you doing here ? - [ Dylan ] Hi , Charlie . Sweetie , why don 't you take Dylan to the car , - go get him a juice box ? - OK . Come on , Dylan . How did you find us ? Well , actually , my people called your people . [ Olivia ] The bodyguards ? In my flash forward , I think I was on the verge of figuring out something really crucial , but I think for that to happen , I have to be at your house . I have to recreate those conditions . Tell you what , why don 't you let yourself in ? Then you recreate - all the conditions you want . - Listen to me . Listen . You 're part of it . You and Charlie . It 's like Gabriel said . You 're part of the puzzle . - How , exactly ? - [ Lloyd ] I don 't know . I just know that you are . [ Olivia ] This is bigger than you and me . We can 't stop it . I 've tried . Mark pushed me away to save the world ... No , I can 't push you away . Don 't you understand ? I can 't do this alone . Maybe you should . You 're part of the equation , and I cannot do it without you . - [ Beeps ] - [ Car door opens ] What , uh ... What are you doing here ? - Did you find her ? - [ Bryce ] They just released her . I got a contact number for her . - It 's ... - [ beeps ] It 's the restaurant where I saw her in my flash forward . - Turns out it 's in LA . - It 's all coming true for you . Look , Bryce , I ... I just wanted to say that I 'm sorry . You know , she flew all the way across the Pacific Ocean just to meet you , and I I tried to keep you apart . - No , I 'm sorry . This whole thing is my fault . I 'm sorry . I 've been ignoring the truth , the feelings that I had . I know it sounds crazy , but I love her . This whole thing with her was meant to be . I mean , I put these on this morning without a second thought . It wasn 't until half an hour ago that I realized this is what I was wearing in my flash forward . - I gotta go . - Yeah . You should go . [ Shudders ] [ Airplane approaching ] [ Woman over PA ] All liquids , gels and aerosols must be in 3-ounce or smaller containers . [ Woman continues in a foreign language over PA ] [ Gasps ] [ Speaking in Japanese ] [ Grunts ] [ Continues in Japanese ] - [ Both grunting ] - [ Radio sounding ] [ Sirens sound ] - [ Tires screeching ] - [ Chatter over radio ] [ Mark ] No , no , no , no , no . Hear me out . Wait . Hear me out . Whoever put those bombs in there is targeting something specific . So we need to figure out what . So help me , Mark , all the glorious choirs of heaven , if you step out of this car , I will have your head on a plate . I 'm gonna send over a driver . Stay in the car . [ Man speaking indistinctly ] You need a friend , so I tracked him down for you . - [ Beeps ] - [ Phone ringing ] Someone to keep you company while you wait . [ Ringing ] - Hello ? - Aaron , it 's Mark . Where the hell are you ? [ Aaron ] Listen , I 'm OK , but I talked to Wedeck , and I need to know what 's going on with you . I don 't know . I just kind of lost it . And then and then I started to drink . You know sometimes what happens in the world makes us forget it 's all up to us . We have choices you , me , Tracy . You choose what 's next and you 'll wind up right where you 're supposed to be . - Take care of yourself , Mark . - OK . [ Man over radio ] Teams , deploy to positions . Agent Benford . Been celebrating ? A little . Had to get back to the office , though . Loose ends . There 's nothing to see up there , Mark . It 's a fool 's errand . Last time I listened to you , I took my eyes off the prize . Not gonna happen again . Have to go . Got a little errand to run . [ Sirens sounding ] I have a new goldfish named Sadie . - Can I see it ? - Come on . It 's upstairs . I want cookies after . - Dylan , that 's not how we ask . - It 's OK . [ Charlie speaks Spanish ] That means my house is your house , too . [ Dylan ] It 's my house , too . - So ... - [ Charlie ] Come on ! So ... 9 : 33 . Twenty-seven minutes till your epiphany . Yeah , uh ... - OK . I think I 'd better get to work . - Right . [ Clears throat ] So how ... how does this work ? Just take our positions at 10 : 00 , wait for your breakthrough ? Yeah , I think I 'll keep my shirt on this time . OK . [ Beeps ] What the hell ? - I don 't know what happened . - Open this door . - I don 't know what happened . Wait ... - Now ! Simon ! I don 't know what happened . I knew you 'd try to pull something , you sociopathic , lying son ... You 're welcome . Come on in . - Your friend asked you to trust me . - Janis wanted me to help you . I do not trust you . This is the last piece of leverage I have left . And now you have it . Let 's get to work . Shall we ? - [ Sirens sounding ] - [ Helicopter whirring ] [ Man over radio ] Confirming devices on floors five , six and ten , over . - You got a det time ? - [ man ] Affirmative , 36 minutes and counting . Copy that . What 's the update ? Bombs , Mark . We 've located them on at least five floors . - This is bigger than Hellinger . - Yeah . He 's just a link in the chain . They 're coming after Mosaic . Are you about to do what I think you 're about to do ? Your chances of making it out of there are not good . I need you to do something for me . If they 're coming after Mosaic , Lloyd Simcoe is not safe , either . - Now , I 've got this covered . - I 'll secure Simcoe . - You can find him at ... - Your house . It 's what I saw . It 's ... It 's where I 'm going , right ? Right . Lock it down . You should know that I also saw myself telling another agent you were dead . - Lloyd Simcoe 's key . We need him alive . - Same goes for you . I 'll keep that in mind . Mom , come here ! My God . He got into your lipstick and just started writing . It 's the formula in my flash forward . This is what I saw . [ Olivia ] How is that possible ? I always assumed I 'd written it . I guess Dylan must have memorized it this afternoon . - Is he in trouble ? - No . - Can we get cookies now ? - Sure . Charlie , why don 't you take Dylan downstairs and show him where they are ? [ Charlie ] I will , but he already knows . Come on , Dylan . So what is this ? What does it mean ? This equation somehow links the QED , the blueprints and the flash forward all together . But it 's a math problem , right ? How would it possibly tie all those things together ? It 's the tachyon constant . It 's the greatest mystery in all of quantum physics . And I have to solve it right now . [ Man over megaphone ] Evacuate the entire building ! - Clear , blue team ! Clear ! - [ Radio sounding ] [ Woman ] I 've been waiting for you . - I 'm really happy to see you . - Everything 's gonna be OK . That 's what we saw , right ? I haven 't felt her move in three hours . We 're gonna get you an ultrasound . - Ready . - OK . - He 's where ? - He 's in the building with the bombs . Where I left my car keys . [ Wedeck ] We 've got 23 minutes until the building goes . We 've gotta get Benford . The answers will come . You sound so certain . At 10 : 00pm , the answers will come because they will . It 's not about equations . It 's not about the two of us just physically being here . It 's about this moment right here . I 've fought it and resisted it and yet , here it is . It happened . The future happened . All of it ? - [ Panting ] - [ Bullets ricocheting ] - Somebody means business . - Yeah , you got that right . You want up or down ? - Down . - Go for it . I got you covered . I 'm exactly where I 'm supposed to be . [ Helicopter whirring ] - I 'm sorry . You can 't come in . - Please , please . I 'm ... I 'm supposed to meet a woman here . I learned Japanese , uh ... [ speaking in Japanese ] [ Speaking in Japanese ] Please ... [ speaks in Japanese ] Thank you . [ Horns honking ] - Try a different street , please ? - When we can get to one . I mean , the traffic 's nuts . OK . I need to go . Thank you . [ Horn honks ] [ Tires screeching ] - [ Firecrackers sputtering ] - [ Crowd cheering ] [ Man over speakers ] All right , everybody . It 's almost 10 : 00 . Five more minutes till we catch up to our future ! You installed the software . Now you can 't find the file ? - I 'm just not seeing it yet . Beer ? - Beer ? Helps me cogitate . - You know , Janis is gonna be OK . - How do you know ? She saw it in her flash forward . [ Demetri ] All right , let 's get going . Someone could walk in here any second . - It 's almost 10 : 00 . - [ Computer beeps ] [ Keyboard tapping ] I 'm supposed to send Lloyd a text . What is that , math ? [ Simon ] It 's an equation for a damped one-dimensional wave . It was Lloyd 's e-mail signature for years ... - [ beeps ] ... a damped wave . He used to call it his " tearful good-bye . " That 's cute . Is that physics humor ? [ Simon ] Well , I 'm supposed to send him something . He saw it . - An inside joke for an inside joke . - [ Cell phone beeping ] [ Man over speaker ] Four , three , two , one ! - It 's 10 : 00 , everybody ! - [ Cheering ] - [ Cell phone beeps ] - It 's the text from Simon . A wave . Good God . I have to make a call . [ Cell phone ringing ] [ Chuckles ] - Yeah . - It 's me . [ Mark ] Did you crack it ? Look , the constant I 've been looking for , it isn 't a number . It 's a wave . If I plug the wave into the blueprint equation , I get an interval , which , if added to the previous blackout , - tells us ... - Tells us what , Lloyd ? As precisely as I can tell the next blackout is sometime in April 2010 , which means it 's in the next two days . Mark ? Mark ? Are you still there ? April ? April ? 2010 ... [ door chimes ] - [ Indistinct chattering ] - [ Panting ] [ Monitor beeping ] The baby 's fine . Good heartbeat . But , it 's a boy . It 's a boy ? - You disappointed ? - No . - Just surprised . - Future 's like that . Yeah . [ Gun blasting ] [ Beeping ] [ Ricocheting ] [ Glass shattering ] [ Helicopter whirring ] God , we 're almost through this thing . Finally go back to the way things used to be where the only stuff we see is what 's right in front of us . Welcome to the future . Who did this ? The strings are different . They moved . [ Whispers ] Gabriel . Gabriel ... Make it look right . You make it look right . Gabriel . Gabriel . Gabriel ... Gabriel . Gabriel . April ... Black out . T. ... E N. F O ... U R T ... E E N PM . April 29th 10 : 14 . The blackout ... it 's in 12 minutes . [ Simon ] The command system won 't let me access it . What was it you said earlier ? " Now the only thing we can see is what 's right in front of us ? " Whoever did this may have copied the entire mainframe , created some kind of clone . Wait . So what you 're looking at is a fake , designed to prevent me from getting in . They knew I 'd be back . Remember me ? Now all I have to do is backdoor into my archived account , compare the system , compare the code ... [ Demetri ] I have no idea what you 're talking about . Bye-bye . [ Beeping ] - You got it ? - Downloading it for you now . I don 't know who you work for , Mr. Hellinger , but whoever they are , they won 't be very happy that you didn 't prevent this not at all . Done . - [ Beeps ] Whatever you need to track the bastards is in here . [ Firecrackers sputtering ] OK . Hey . Sweetie , go . Go , go . Go play with Dylan . Mark Benford is dead . He ran into the building . Doesn 't have a chance . [ Cell phone rings ] - [ Blasting ] - [ Shattering ] - [ Nicole coughs ] - Oh , hey , hey , hey , hey . Are you OK ? Careful . What happened ? [ Panting ] You went off the road into the lake . I wasn 't even sure you were with us . Then I pulled you out of the car and you started fighting me . Hey , come on . Hey , you must be freezing . - Here . There . - OK . Hey , it 's OK . It 's OK . In my flash forward , I I saw myself saving you . And all these months I thought maybe I failed . I 'm ... I 'm really happy that I didn 't . - You saw me ? - Yeah . OK . An ambulance is on its way , OK ? Hey . My name 's Ed . Nicole . [ Beeping ] What ? - What is it ? - Someone 's accessing - the mainframe from outside . - [ Demetri ] What does that mean ? It 's a different command system , originating off-site . They have control . [ Female voice ] Commencing activation sequence . [ Sirens sounding ] [ Electronic whirring ] [ Grunts ] [ Yells ] What have you done , Simon ? Get away from there . Put your hands up ! Now ! [ Panting ] You lying son of a bitch . Hey , I didn 't do this , Demetri ! Not then and certainly not now ! I 'm not gonna let them do this to me . I won 't let them turn me into a monster , to use my machine , my mind . Millions of people , Demetri millions of people don 't deserve to die . You know what ? You want to stop me ? You want to stop me from doing what I 'm doing , which is trying to shut down this machine ? Then you 're going to have to shoot me . [ Keyboard tapping ] [ Door opens ] [ Grunts ] [ Elevator dings ] [ Yells ] [ Panting ] [ Ringing ] - Yeah ? - It 's Mark . You 're still in the building ? Get the hell out now ! The next blackout ... I figured it out , Stan . It 's gonna be at 10 : 14pm , Pacific tonight . Call the White House , EBS , NTSB , everyone . This place is about to go in three minutes . Move now ! Make the call , Stan . Assistant Director Stanford Wedeck . Yes . Put me through to the White House , now . [ Woman ] Credible information that another global blackout - will hit in minutes ... - [ man ] Urging citizens to take - necessary measures ... - [ man 2 ] Security protocols put into place for global blackout . [ Ringing ] - Mark ! - Livy , listen very carefully . [ Whispers ] The next blackout 's about to happen . Take Charlie , get her somewhere safe . It 's gonna happen in about two minutes . Tell her I love her . - I love you both . - [ Olivia ] Please be safe , Mark . [ Mark ] Good-bye , Livy . " President Segovia has issued an evacuation order in light of credible reports that another global blackout will hit . He 's urging immediate steps to be taken to ensure public safety and is appealing for calm . " [ Simon ] You might want to put that ring on . You know what ? I didn 't see my future the last time around . I 'm not gonna miss it this time . You want it ? I 've seen my future . This is it ... right now . What did you see ? You might want to sit down for this one . You ready ? [ Rumbling ] - Hang on ! - I am ! [ Helicopter whirring ] [ Beeping ] Just hang on ! [ Overlapping chatter ] [ Down tempo music plays ] [ Chuckling ] [ Man ] Charlie ? What is it ? You gotta tell me . They found him .

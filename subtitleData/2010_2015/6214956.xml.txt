 Engines are running at full capacity , sir . Lieutenant Chung did a whale of a job . Indeed he did . We should be in Costa Rica by tomorrow morning . Attention on deck ! - How far inland are we going , sir ? - Carry on . Dr. Scott said the jungle there is close to the shoreline . - Should give us easy access in and out . - Sounds good , sir . - These gonna work for you , sir ? - Yeah , good work . Well done , men . Don 't exactly love the idea of experimenting on monkeys . Better than humans , sir . - Hey , Tex . - What 's up ? Hey , fancy meeting you here . It 's been a month since I 've had any spare time to exercise . Other than sprinting away from the Russians in the Arctic . - Heh . - Yeah , I heard about that . Pretty ballsy , if I do say so myself . Survival instinct , nothing more . [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] - Dumbbell ? - Ha , ha . No , I think I 'm done , thanks . How come I never see you up in the wardroom for meals ? Well , you might not have heard ... but I 'm not particularly well-liked on this ship . Ha , ha . I find that hard to believe . I had to lie to them all for four months ... while we were up in the Arctic . The world was crumbling . Their families were dying . I knew it , and I wasn 't allowed to breathe a word of it . I think you underestimate people 's capacity for forgiveness . Maybe you just find it too hard to forgive yourself . It 's not all on you , you know . - Isn 't it ? - No . I 'll see you later . Wardroom . I 'll save a spot for you . [ SCOFFS ] CHANDLER : Wednesday , November 5th . We 're headed to Costa Rica to try to find Dr. Scott some monkeys . I don 't know why I keep making these recordings ... or who might ever find them , and how they 'd even get them to you . Ha , ha . I keep trying to picture you all in my father 's cabin . You could barely spend a weekend with the man ... so you 're probably just about ready to tear his head off by now . It 's hard here . Not knowing what 's going on in the outside world , wondering if ... When . When we come home ... what we 'll be coming back to . [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] Hey , sorry to disturb you . We 're picking up all kinds of distress signals coming out of Costa Rica ... - especially outside Lim√≥n . - What kind of distress ? A lot of sickness . Civil unrest . Doesn 't look like we 'll get safe passage into that jungle . - Civil unrest ? - Nothing we can do anything about ... unless you wanna get sidetracked and get into the nation-building business . Better get Dr. Scott up here . I already spoke to her . She says our next best option 's Nicaragua . There 's a monkey reserve about 30 miles up that long , narrow river . We 'll never get the ship in there , but we can send teams on the RHIBs . - Thirty miles . - Yeah , outside radar range . Comms is unsure whether the frequency signals ... will be strong enough to keep in radio contact too . - Just keeps getting better . - Oh , you haven 't heard the best part . Dr. Scott insists that she comes along for the ride . Unless any of us can tell the difference between a capuchin tufted ... and a Geoffroy 's spider monkey . Is that reserve inhabited ? She said she was there a few years back . But there are only small teams of anthropologists ... that visit sometimes to observe . So otherwise , not supposed to be . Gonna need plenty of room on that RHIB for those monkeys . We 'll go with small teams . - You 'll handle it . - Not just me . I 'm gonna need all my best men . That includes you . Been a while since I 've been hunting . Mm . Whoo ! Man , I love a hunting trip . Ensign Mason has taken a field radio . As usual we will operate at EMCON . They will report in , but we will not respond . We do expect the teams will fall out of range . When they do , we 'll go to a flare system . Green means , " No radio contact available , but all is okay . " Red means , " No radio , and things are not okay . " Hope we never see that red flare , but we 're prepared in case we do . - I need a lookout on the bridge wing . - Aye , commander . Look familiar ? Well , this is the edge of the reserve . As I recall , there 's a stream in there near a waterfall . The monkeys would congregate there because of the clean water . - Report our position back to the ship . - Yes , sir . Tex , Burk , stay here with Mason and Dr. Scott . - The rest of us will scout the area . - Captain Chandler ... You 're staying here . Got it . They just disembarked at the western edge of the reserve ... southern bank , still in radio range . Hey , uh , doc , you got a fella ? The last I heard , he was in Beijing , but that was months ago now . He 's a journalist . Travels a lot . And you ? Oh , I 'm a bit of a rolling stone , as you might imagine . A man your age , never married ? A man my age ? Hit a soft spot , did I ? Oh , I 'm 2-percent body fat , honey . Ain 't no soft spot to hit . Except for that 2 percent . Oh ! She is a smart one , isn 't she ? [ TEX CHUCKLES ] Oh , you hear that ? Water . Waterfall . [ SPEAKING IN SPANISH ] Masks ! Now ! Masks ! - El Toro ! - El Toro ! Fall back , fall back . - There 's nothing we can do for you . Sorry . - Back to the boats now . I 'm sorry . We cannot help you . Jesus , where are they all coming from ? Get away ! Get off me ! - Get off him ! - El Toro , signor . - Back to the boats now ! - El Toro ! - I 'm sorry , we can 't help you . - Stay back ! - Move , move , move ! MAN : El Toro ! Hey , Burky . Cubano ? - Perks of Gitmo , my man . - I 'll wait . We 've got trouble . Start your engines ! You are out of here now ! Back to the James ! I cannot risk you going upriver , and it 's not open for debate . We 'll get you an assortment of monkeys . You 'll have to make do . Now , Burk ! GARNETT : They 're splitting up . That was not the plan . MASON : According to this chart , the nearest town is 20 miles in on that side of the river . They made it all the way here through the jungle on foot ? - What about the other side of the river ? - Nothing , sir . At least not here . They must have been congregating by the waterfall . There 's gotta be other places in this region to find monkeys . Well , you know Costa Rica 's no good . According to Dr. Scott ... most of Central America 's a hot zone , not many choices . Upriver . Ma 'am , Tex and Lieutenant Burk just landed with Dr. Scott . - She 's in Decon . - I 'll debrief her in the wardroom . Yes , ma 'am . Nathan James , this is Vulture Team . Over . Nathan James , this is Vulture Team . Over . We 're out of range , sir . - All right , send up the green flare . - Yes , sir . Clear ! What the ... ? Weapons ! - " El Toro " ? - That 's what all the sick people were saying . - Board it , sir ? - Absolutely not . We keep moving . The most concentrated area for the primates is on the northern bank , deep upriver . And the captain knows as much . I suspect they 're headed that way . You have no reason to believe there 's human population ? No , but I don 't think there 'd be any on the southern side either . So once they are out of radio range they can 't come back in , correct ? It 'll be flares from here on out . We have to hope the weather 's clear enough that we can even see them . Perhaps you should send a backup team out there on the other RHIB ? Captain would 've specified that . Protocol is 48 hours , unless we get that red flare . Damn it . - Oh , shit , set perimeter ! - Aah ! Oh , my God ! I got you . I got you . Listen , son , I 'm not gonna lie to you . This is gonna hurt . Aah ! Oh , God , it stings ! - It 's like my leg is on fire . - Ambush ! Ambush , ambush ! U.S. Navy ! Stand down ! Hold your fire ! Hold your fire ! Walk . Let 's go . [ MEN SPEAKING IN SPANISH ] MAN : Straight , walk straight . Hello . Welcome to my jungle . I 'm guessing you must be El Toro . I am , indeed . Who do I have the pleasure of talking to ? Tom Chandler , U.S. Navy . Your men took our weapons , CBR suits , and equipment . We 're gonna need them back . You won 't need your suits . There is no virus here . As for your weapons , I cannot have your men with machine guns . That would frighten my people . Well , I 'm afraid that 's not acceptable . With respect , I don 't have time to debate it . The remainder of my crew , some 200-odd U.S. Navy sailors ... await our return aboard our destroyer , U.S.S. Nathan James ... currently in the bay at the mouth of the river . If we don 't return by 2300 hours , they 'll come looking . And rest assured , they will find us . So why are you here , commander ? We 're just passing through . - Mm . - Looking for food , supplies . Our man stepped on one of your traps . Yes , your man does not look so good . The sooner we get him back to the ship ... He is not gonna make it back to the ship , at least not alive . The poison in his veins is gonna kill him soon , I am the only one with the antidote . So you can let us give your man the help he needs ... or you can continue with your , uh , impotent threats . You decide . You give my man the antidote right now ... and you better hope for your sake it 's not too late . John Wayne . Clint Eastwood . American macho , no ? Don 't suppose this guy 's familiar with what a Tomahawk missile can do . You feel better ? You think your power , and not my generosity , is gonna help your man , huh ? [ IN SPANISH ] I 'm sure you are hungry . So we will dine , commander . Hey , there you are . I was hoping you 'd show up . A little late for the party , but what 's mine is yours . The fish is pretty good . Freshly caught this morning , or so I 'm told . The team 's not back yet . Heard as much . No flares either . It 'll be dark soon . Yeah , they 're probably all sitting around a cozy campfire ... telling ghost stories , roasting marshmallows . What you saw in Guantanamo Bay ... Some of the worst of human nature . And yet somehow ... you still manage to find the humor . Secret source of humor is not joy but sorrow . Ain 't no humor in heaven . A guy named Twain said that , more or less . You ever read Huck Finn , Tom Sawyer ? They 're American classics . " Everyone is a moon who has a dark side which he never shows to anybody . " Yes , I know Twain . Well , then ... we have something in common . Marshmallows , huh ? No doubt . You must wonder how I managed to achieve such opulence out here in the wilderness . We saw your yacht on our way up the river . My captain said the waters would be much deeper . It turns out he was wrong , yeah . It 's impressive , no ? It took my men one week to take everything off of the sinking ship . Please . Delgado , come join us . Sit , sit . This is Mayor Ervin Delgado ... former mayor of the former town , Bocana Caoba . He and his people , they stumbled upon us trying to escape the virus . Lucky for them , they found me . Lucky for you , they had tents . Can 't imagine you thought of that ... since you were expecting to be living off your boat . That 's very perceptive . Bravo . And they sleep out there , on those filthy blankets ... with no shelter from the elements , while you live like this . I don 't expect you to understand my methods , so , Bas , explain to them . The society is based on the ancient Inca system of labor exchange known as mita . Our people provide the labor . El Toro provides the infrastructure and protection . Protection ? Yes , sir . Where we 're from , we call that slavery . These people are alive , while millions around the world are not , because of me . These guards of mine , that trap that your man stepped on ... these are the things that keep the people on the other side of the river ... that are sick away from here . This is what keeps Delgado 's people alive . - Is that not right , Bas ? - Yes , El Toro . Si . Now , please , eat , eat , eat . The ladies have prepared a local delicacy for you to enjoy , so ... I think his fever 's going down . Whatever he gave him seems to be working . You think they 're really gonna let us leave here ? [ MAN SPEAKING IN SPANISH ] So how is it that you made all your money ? I 'm guessing it wasn 't ladies ' handbags . - No ? - I 'm thinking cocaine . Heroin , maybe . - Mm . Now you judge . SLATTERY : I 'm just trying to get a sense ... - for who we 're dealing with . - Mike . EL TORO : Hmm . Mm-hm . Hmm . No , no , this ... This is , uh ... This is Karina . This is the mayor 's daughter . Mayor Delgado . Big man , big family . All daughters , you know . All very , very beautiful . And this one , Karina , she is in her prime . Well , almost . Her younger sister , she 's the real prize . [ SPEAKING IN SPANISH ] - He 's a pig . - Karina . My father won 't say it , but I will . No , please , El Toro , she means no disrespect . Bas , she called me " pig . " She means no disrespect . You say you have a ship with guns and men . - Then do something . - Karina . [ SPEAKING IN SPANISH ] She 's young . There is nothing to be done here . She does not understand . We are safe from the plague , and we are grateful to El Toro . Please , tell him she has not provoked you . Please . Our only interest is getting out of here with our man healthy . [ SPEAKING IN SPANISH ] - I think it 's time we check on our man . - No , I don 't think so . You have not finished your meal , and there are several things that we need to discuss . [ EL TORO SPEAKING IN SPANISH ] Several of these were found on your boat . You want to explain to me what they 're for ? Like I told you , we need food . No fishing gear ? You hunt with tranquilizer guns ? I don 't like being lied to , captain . Not after the hospitality that I have extended to you . We 're investigating the virus , trying to find the cause . We think it might come from the monkeys . That 's why we were wearing the suits . You think the monkeys cause the virus ? It 's a theory . We have been living amongst them for months . In fact , you just dined on them . If you needed monkeys , all you had to do was ask . It 's the secrets and dishonesty that lead to dangerous misunderstandings . So how many do you need ? [ MONKEYS CHATTERING ] Well , we got what we came for . - Brandy ? - Thank you , no . You know , besides finding those cages ... my men also found your radio . It does not get a signal out here in the jungle . That depends on which frequency you try . Our comms man is the one who stepped on your spike . Yet you also brought flares . They provide our position . As a matter of fact , we fired one before we got off our boats outside your compound . So why the different colors ? We use red during the day and green at night . I believe something different . I believe green communicates , " All is good . " And red means , " Danger . " It 's a universal language , no ? Ma 'am , the lookout just saw a new flare . Very low on the horizon , southwest of our current position . - Green or red ? - Green , ma 'am . Very well . Four of them , two of us . I like our odds . We 're working on a diplomatic solution here . - And what about all these people ? - Not our mission . - No ? - No . KARINA : Please , help me , please ! [ MAN SPEAKING IN SPANISH ] - Hey , what is this ? - Taking her across the river ! They 're gonna leave her with the infected people ! No , no , no . You let her go . You let her be . KARINA : Help me ! [ ALL SHOUTING ] Karina . Papa ! Please . DELGADO : Karina ! Old Leadbottom wants me back to help him interrogate a spy ... TEX : This never gets old . Ha , ha . On our island ? There must be some mistake , Skip . Gee , if there were any Japanese on our island , we 'd know about it . You 're not getting much sleep , are you ? [ GASPS ] Whoa , it 's okay , it 's okay . Just me . Everything 's okay . - Something 's happened . - No . No , I know it . We saw the flare a couple hours ago . It was green . Green 's good . Trust me , it 's just a dream . They killed her . The sons of bitches sent her across to the other side , let her die like that . I 'm only gonna say this once . Release my men immediately . [ CHUCKLES ] You Americans , always in charge , right ? Boss , the jefe . You could have left today with your belly full of mangoes and a boat full of monkeys ... but no , you just could not keep your nose out of other people 's business . I don 't know what happened here or what you 're planning . - But let me remind you ... - Shh . Your XO has already briefed me ... that you 're gonna rain down holy hellfire on the whole jungle . I heard the threats . But you lost radio contact , and your ship does not know where you are . So , what are you gonna do ? You gonna send us to the other side of the river ? You think I can maintain a society without rules ? Without consequences ? It 's the only reason why we are still here and the rest of the world dies around us . Come on , you call this a society ? EL TORO : Commander ... we 'll keep your weapons , your suits , and the rest of your equipment . You can have your men and your lives and your monkeys . That is the only offer that I give you . Is that clear ? I understand . Oh . One more thing . If you 're thinking of sending drones or missiles ... I just wanna remind you ... that the children will be sleeping in the tents with me . Starting here . No , no . Oh , no . - Valeria . - Please , no . - Please , no . - Please , don 't do this . Don 't do this ! She 's too young . She 's too young . What happened ? We got the monkeys ? Yeah , we got the monkeys . Stop the boat . Stop the boat , master chief . - This cannot stand . - Sir , with all due respect ... I know it 's not our mission , and I don 't care . We cannot leave those people like that . I counted 13 guards . Seven in the tent compound , four in the village . Two on the perimeter . At night they might up the ante , especially if they think we might turn around . Gentlemen , let 's keep our heads cool . This is not the mission at hand . We 're supposed to save the world . Shouldn 't it be worth saving ? JETER : If we had Burk and Tex and weapons , maybe , but this ? What if we don 't make it back ? What happens to him ? What 'll Dr. Scott do without monkeys ? What 'll our crew do without its leader ? I have daughters . You have a daughter . Sir ? We came to hunt . No . [ EL TORO SPEAKING IN SPANISH ] [ NECK CRACKS ] [ SHOUTING ] [ SPEAKING IN SPANISH ] Mm-hm . [ GRUNTING ] [ NECK CRACKS ] [ SHOUTS ] You can go help them . I can make it back myself if I have to . [ SHOUTING AND GRUNTING ] Go to sleep . Go to sleep . [ GIRL CRYING ] [ SPEAKING IN SPANISH ] [ IN SPANISH ] Valeria ! You 're finished , Bas . It 's over . Drop the knife . EL TORO : Okay . I surrender . Come on , show me that American justice . I 'm sure I 'll be fine on your ship . I 've lived in considerably worse places . So arrest me ! Come on ! Huh ? [ SHOUTING ] [ EL TORO GASPING ] This place is yours now . Not mine . Ours . Just got word . They 're on their way back . - All of them ? - Mm-hm . All of them . Uh , plus a boatload of monkeys . [ BOTH CHUCKLING ] Told you there 's nothing to worry about . Why not ? Cheers . Cheers .

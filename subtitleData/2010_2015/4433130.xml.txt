 IJON TICHY - SPACE PILOT The Star Diaries Freely produced by themes from the novel " Star diaries " by Stanislaw Lem I was flying on Friday , October 7th ... through a constellation of total drought ! It was hot ! I was still on my way to the Egg planet ... with a growling belly ! It 's not a good idea ... to eat salt on an empty stomach , in this heat , Mr. Tichy . Better than eating nothing , huh ? It 's your job to do what I say , not to think ! And now I have important business to do ! Take over the wheel ! Mr. Tichy , I 've checked almost all of the planets . I can 't find my home ... - I need to go now ! I 'm always in the way ... Oh , there 's no more water . What ? Unbelievable . Why didn 't you check the water tank ? How am I supposed to go to the potty-chair ? You drank up all the water not me , maybe you should 've thought of that before ! The bell ! Hail to the Chief , Mighty Elron ! Noble pilgrims , you have come in time to the constellation of draught ! You can cleanse your soul on our planet . Cleanse ... - It 's totally Sepulken-free . Sepulken-free ... Sepulken-free ? So what ? Aren 't you searching for your place in life , your smallest room ? Smallest room ... You there , with the receptacle ... You look like one of Elron 's Waterboys ... our most respected companions . Let yourself be assimilated ! - Assimilate ! Assinme ... what ? - How do you get assimilated ? Look into the vortex ... assimilate ... Give us your water , stifle it ! Who do they think they can impress with this crap ? Assimilated , assimilated ... Such a cheap cheating-trick ? What kind of planet is so full of jackasses ? I looked it up in the Cosmic Encyclopedia . It said that this planet was a desert ... with no water . The rocket made a nosedive . Directly into the cosmic light-swirl ! You furry rat ! Mel-fellow ! What 're you doing ? Come out of there ! Mel-fellow , you stinky mutt . Open the door ! Assimilate , assimilate ! Are you cuckoo ? You let these jackasses into our rocket ? I am home ... - What ? Home ? Get over here , buddy-boy ! Look outside , water everywhere , and you 're water-shy ! I was shocked . This planet was not full of deserts , it was full of wet water ! Home ... Home , home ! - Mel ! SEPULKEN PROHIBITED ! See ? He was unhappy ... and open to this kind of thing because you treated him badly . Where is your water ? - What ? We need water to serve Elron . I don 't have any wet-water ! I have another problem ... I need to go to the potty-chair ! Oh no , he 's still awake , he didn 't look into the vortex . He wants to besmirch the waters of Elron , the greatest sin on Aquarius ! You 're arrested . Off we go to Admiral Lurch . What about Mel ? Beware , a sinner ! He needs to go . - I 'll stifle it . And you make sure this woman doesn 't destroy anything . SEPULKEN PROHIBITED ! This planet was strangely weird . It seemed hypnotized people brought their water to this planet ... and then they were sent to find new people - to bring more water . And all for some Mighty Chief Elron , but why ? There 's the potty-chair . I need to go ! No . That 's not a toilet . Stop . It 's forbidden ! So buddy-boy , you 'd better seal that mail slot if you don 't want to drown ! I 'll stifle it ... Don 't you even care ? Wake up ! I 'll stifle it , Mighty Chief Elron . Well then , let 's try not to destroy anything . Assimilated , assimilated . I had to go the potty chair so bad ! Maybe if I went , quietly ... in the water ... No one would notice . I 'll stifle it , I 'll stifle it ... All Elron ... Hail thingy ... But it 's hard to go when someone 's watching ! Then I saw another potty-chair . But it was also off-limits . No one here was allowed to go to the potty-chair . Why ? Greetings young tadpole . Did you have a pleasant assimilation ? Yes , very pleasant ! Sepulken ? - No , sepulken-free ! Good , thanks for your valuable water . Go forth and assimilate new donors . Thank you ! Very pleasant . Where 's your flying fish ? I don 't have my own spaceship . I 'd rather stay here at home . Ok , then you can be a watering tadpole in the nest . An important job in the swarm ! Did you have a pleasant assimilation ? Sepulken ? - Sepulke ? Nah ! What kind of question is that ? I 'm Ijon Tichy ! Sepulken ... Good , welcome to Aquarius , brother . Thank you for the valuable water . What does the word ... " Sepulken " mean ? Sepulken-alarm ! Sepulken-alarm ! Get him ! Beware ! A sepulker ! Stifle it ! I 'll stifle it , Great Elron ! Behind the house ... I saw a funnel pipe ... with all the stolen wet-water going to the tower . I 'll stifle it ... Obviously this mighty Elron-Chief sat in that blinky tower . What did I care ? Stifle it ! Stifle ... He 's still awake ! Good-Elron to you ... - Get him ! Take him to Admiral Lurch ! He needs to be blocked ! Come with us ! Keep your grabby-paws off me ! You worthless tadpole wanted to besmirch the Holy Waters of Elron ! That means you didn 't look into the vortex and are still awake ! Now I 'll put you into a state from which you , like all of us ... will never need to discharge again . Hey , Fresh-fish ! Bring the Mobile-hypnotizer . I 'm gonna block this tadpole ! The Hypnotizator , Admiral Lurch . Block him , the traitor ... Mel-Fellow ! Are you a gaga head ? - Be silent , you worthless tadpole . I 'm a respected member of this swarm . This is my home . Good ! Let 's hypnotize you ! Stifle it ... Stifle it . Stifle it ! Holy crap ! How dare you ! Dammit ! He 's still awake . This is how a decent hypnosis is supposed to work ... I 'll hold back ... Yippee-ki-yay , fishsucker ! Enough ! Hail Chief crap ! I 'm not the scoundrel ; it 's the Elron Chief thingamajig ! And now ... I really need to go to the potty chair ! - He still needs to go . There 's only one thing left : The Worst Case Hypnosis Machine : WC Urinella . WC Urinella ... You 're discharged ! You 're discharged ! Move it ! You 're discharged ! Move it ! No one has ever outsmarted Worst Case Urinella yet ! Please ... after I 've been hypnotized ... can I go to the potty chair somewhere ? Move it ! You idiot ! Discharge ... Mel ? What ... are you doing ? So , that 's how it is ... I get it . Mel , watch out ! Behind you ! No ! We 've got you , you worthless tadpole ! Oh great ! You worthless tadpole , now you 'll be blocked and beholden ... like we all , for the great Elron . No one has ever outlasted W.C. Urinella ! Look into the vortex ! Fresh-fish Mel , activate complete blockage of this disciple . Mel ? Mel ! Oh , another one , drowned again ! Stifle it ! Stifle it ! Why did this WC hypnosis-machine have to look like a huge piss pot ? I couldn 't stifle it any longer ! Look in the vortex ! Block yourself . I give up ! I 'll assinsimmate . Look away ! No ! No ! I 've had enough . You 're a hopeless case ! I was now in a dry cell , the only nice and dry place on this whole planet ... as punishment ... Although , it did smell a little of wet dog . So what ? I was finally alone ... Mr. Tichy ! - Mel-fellow . What 're you doing here ? I was arrested ' cause I broke the supreme commandment . What did you do ? - Well , I sepulked , you know . I don 't know . " Sepulked " ? Was does that even mean ? I did a ... wee-wee ! Dammit , I pissed in the water ! So that 's " sepulke " ? - Yes ! You 're not allowed to go in the wet water ! It woke me up out of the hypnosis ! So that 's how you snap out of it ? - Yes . Now I get it ! That 's why they have that sign . Well ... Come on . Yes , no ! Mr. Tichy , I can 't . I 'm scared of the water ! Don 't scold me again ! Hurry up ! Let 's cut them off . They 're trying to escape ! Faster ! Hey , put the rocket in reverse . I 'm getting wet . I 'm being cleansed ! Come on , hurry up ! And how do you feel ? - How do you think I feel ? Marvellous , of course . - Then it worked ! I 'm in a great mood . Let 's attack ! Over there ! Faster ! Fire ! Let 's go see what 's up ... with Elron . I 'm scared . I did it in the holy water and that 's forbidden . There must be a reason for that . I feel like a fish in the water . The universe 's drying up . And I am getting wetter . Sepulken-free and wet water . Hey , servant-tadpole ! - Your wish , great Elron ? What 's going on with that unblockable Sepulker who 's still awake ? Fear not , great Elron . He is being dried out in a cell . There is no more Sepulken danger ! Are you sure ? - Very sure , great Elron , very sure . Have you seen my back-scratcher ? - Yes , great Elron , it 's down there ! I feel like a fish in water ... No , no . The Sepulker ! A fat fish ? - Hold back ! Enough shenanigans . I 've blown your cover , you fishy fraud ! Now I realized why sepulking was forbidden . This was one foul-fish , who wanted a nice life , with pilfered water . Please don 't sepulken , it stings my eyes ! No , not the microphone . Please don 't squeal on me ! Hey , you there ! The sepulker , get him , go ! Go on , catch him ! He 's awake and he wants to sepulk ! You 're not going to do that to me , are you ? Hey , are you gonna let a big fat fish ... make dumb-twits out of you ? I 'll stifle it , great Elron . I 'll stifle it . - Enough ! I 'm not Elron , that 's Elron . A liar and a cheat . He just wants to steal your wet-water . You 're not dumb as doornails , are you ? Which one of them is the Holy Elron ? There is no holy moley here , and also no magic miracles ! Look , Elron is performing a miracle . He 's walking on water ! A miracle ! A great miracle , Great Elron ! Hey stop it . No magic miracle here . It 's just me : Ijon Tichy ! We are unworthy . Hail to the Chief , Ijon Tichy ! A planet full of jackasses ! But at least now they had their backs to me ... so I grabbed my chance ! It stings my eyes ! Mel-fellow , come here ! You dumb-asses , hey ! It 's me ... Elron Tichy . And I say , from now on ... sepulking is allowed ! He allowed sepulking . - What ? No ! Where am I ? I must have been dreaming ... Get out ! Let 's hear the emissary ! What do we do now ? How should I know . Let us build a fish sticks factory ! A fish sticks factory ! Later , people said I made the whole thing up . Nasty people said that I secretly drank too much alcohol on earth ... but lost all inhibitions on long space voyages . God knows how this rumor got started . People are like that . They 'd rather believe a bunch of silly crap than perfectly good facts . Oh , by the way , I filled up our water tank before we left Aquarius . But I can 't figure out ... what the word " Sepulken " means ?

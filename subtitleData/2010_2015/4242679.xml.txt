 Previously on fringe ... Olivia Dunham , FBI . These two men are consultants- - Peter Bishop and Dr. Walter Bishop . You are looking through a window into another world . An alternate Universe just like ours . And in each of them , there is a version of us . Agent Dunham . Agent Lee . Whatever 's happening between the two Universes , whatever our fate is , I 'm right at the center of it . I love you . I was never good at letting you go . This time you have to . I understand what the machine does . Our two worlds are inextricable . If one side dies , we all die . So I 've torn holes in both the Universes , and they lead here . A bridge so that we can begin to work together to fix- - They don 't remember Peter . How could they ? He never exited . He served his purpose . This isn 't gonna work , this truce , because you 're not trustworthy . I mean , simple things like principles , honor , honesty- - all fundamental requirements in an accord . If you can 't trust the people you 're dealing with , what then ? You know , maybe I 'm not the problem . Maybe it 's you . Maybe you are just incapable of trust . Interesting . Coming from the person who kidnapped me and stole my life . You know , being you and living your life only made me more homesick for my Universe . Must be hard to develop trust in people when all you 've got is yourself . Must get terribly lonely . Just because you walked in my shoes don 't you think for a moment that you know me . Yeah . Keep telling yourself that . Happy reading . I 'm sure you 'll find a lot of the cases familiar since you and your people were responsible . Huh . Funny . I was just gonna say the same thing to you . Just prep that dozen . ♪ ♪ I got some in the walk-in . I can check . I received your message . Then you know we have a problem . It is impossible . The timeline has been rewritten . He was erased . And yet traces of him continue to bleed through . It is , as it has always been , our responsibility to insure events play out , as they were intended , before your intervention . This started with you . It must be you who ends it . You okay with that grill ? Yeah , it 's good . Give it a few more minutes . They can never know the boy lived to be a man . I will take care of it . ♪ Fringe 4x01 ♪ Neither Here Nor There Original Air Date on September 23 , 2011 = = sync , corrected by elderman = = ♪ I 'm ready . Toaster was acting up . What ? Then don 't eat toast . You ever heard of cereal ? Lincoln ! Oh , she got me ! Lincoln , why don 't you like toast ? I like toast . But , you see , toast takes time . And if too much time goes by , then we don 't catch any bad guys , and if we don 't catch the bad guys , there might not be any toast . So it 's your dad who must not like toast . Want to see a frog ? Jonathan ! If I have to tell you one more time to pick up that backpack and get going ... - The toaster was late . I 'm a victim in this . Oh , my God . - Hi , Lincoln . - Jules . All right , come on . Let 's go . Did you eat ? I did . Early . Like Robert was supposed to . You know , they did a study on sarcastic people and they get more illnesses in their lifetime . Is that right ? It had something to do with negative energy . Bye , Dad . - Love you . - Love you . Bye , Lincoln . You ever wonder where you 'd be without me ? Put your pants on . Don 't worry . We 're not gonna be late . Don 't move . Robert , he 's down . Robert ! Hey . Unh ! Robert . - Olivia Dunham . - Come with me . Go ahead . Dr. Bishop , it 's me . I 'm at the- - Ow ! Gah ! Where 's the victim 's partner ? That 's him there . That 's Agent Lee . Great . Thank you . Agent Lee ... Olivia Dunham . He used to know her . Yes . Before things changed . I understand that you and your partner were in pursuit of a suspect . We were tracking the sale of some illegal weapons . I was hoping to ask you some questions about what you saw . Sure . Who are you ? I 'm from a special division . I 'm not at liberty to disclose anymore than that . So the person who attacked your partner , can you describe him ? When I first got there , he was kneeling over Robert . I couldn 't tell what he was doing , but his skin was ... Translucent . It 's like what you see on Robert 's face , but more of it . And when he was kneeling over Agent Danzig , did you see anything in his hands like a device or anything that could have done this ? No , I didn 't see anything . I 've requested a field office M.E. He 's on the way . He 's good . He 's thorough . Thank you , but we 're going to take the remains back to our facility . Wait a minute . You 're telling- - that 's my partner . I understand how you feel . You 're some division coming in here and taking over ? You won 't even tell me who you are ? I can assure you that this case will take- - Have you seen the suspect before ? Do you know who he is ? I 'm not at liberty to discuss this . This is my partner we 're talking about here . Maybe you can 't understand that . I 'd like to talk to someone else . There is no one else . There is just me . I am sorry for your loss . Maybe it 's the air . Have you checked the temperature ? It is exactly the same as it always is , Walter- - 72 degrees and 10 % humidity . Maybe the barometric pressure . You can 't tell me there 's not something different in here . This whole place has felt funny for the last week . Walter , it 's been a week since we agreed to work with the other side . And that 's another thing . That man cannot be trusted . I don 't care what he says . I have looked into his eyes . Into his soul . And who would know him better than me ? Don 't forget , Walter . He has plenty of reasons to hate you too . I know you 're not happy about this , but we 're supposed to be going through these case files . Fine . I 'll help you with the case files as soon as I 'm done here , but don 't expect me to like it . ♪ ♪ All I 'm saying , and I 've been very consistent about this , is that there has to be another way . The thing about playing devil 's advocate , my dear , is that your client is the devil himself . Walter , we 're fixing the world . What other choice do we have ? Thank God that machine didn 't blow everybody up . You know , it could have . Excuse me . Here . Hold this . - I 'm looking- - - Shh . Shh . Shh . Three , two , one . Walter ... You brought it back to life . No , no , no . It 's still quite dead . It 's wonderful , isn 't it ? Who are you people ? What the hell are you doing here ? Huh . There 's still a few kinks to work out , but it 's a start . Tapping into traffic camera feeds without a warrant . You and whoever helped you with this is in a lot of trouble . You are not a part of this investigation . You need to leave . I have spent the last two hours going building to building . I am not leaving here without some answers . What division are you in ? What are we dealing with here ? Hello ? I 'll just give your division head a call . I see . It 's good to know we have reception . See , I have a friend at The New York Times would love to know that there is a division of the FBI operating out of Harvard with a man who can make dead birds fly . It 's for you . It 's Broyles . If you really want a story , you should look under the dome . I 'm growing an ear . There 's another body . Let 's go . - I 'm coming with you . - You keep going like this , and you 're gonna talk yourself out of the bureau . I was at the first crime scene . Maybe I saw something that I haven 't told you yet . Maybe that 's why I came here . Okay , come . You can get fired later . Hey , Walter , where 's the- - Here . I fixed the squelching . - It should be fine now . - Thank you . So what do we have ? One female , approximately 30 years old . Any witnesses ? There were some people in the street over there . Some kids . Did anyone see what happened after the crash ? No . But we should have some background on her by now . Okay . Walter . Walter , are you there ? ♪ ♪ Walter , hello ? Walter . Walter , can you hear me ? I 'm here . The microwave was causing a disturbance . I can hear you perfectly . You 're as clear as a bell . How 's the squelching ? It sounds great . I 'd like to see the body . Chop , chop . Don 't let that ham-fist touch her . If you don 't mind holding off for a moment , I 'd just like to do a preliminary . Burn mark like the other victims . Pupils are dilated . That looks like a hematoma on the right clavicle . Yeah , and her right jaw . Rigidity indicates premature rigor mortis . I need to check her anus . Have that large lady there help you lift her . I 'm going to--I 'm going to need to check her anus . Okay . Thank you . ♪ ♪ So what do we know about her ? Her name was Nadine Park . She was a commuter . She parked her car at the train station , which is about four blocks from here at 10 : 45 this morning . She was still behind the wheel , so maybe he was waiting for her in the back seat . He wanted to attack her when there was no one else around . She struggled for a bit and then hit the lamppost . They all said they didn 't see anything ? That 's right . One of these things is not like the other . Hi . I 'm Agent Dunham . Hi . What 's your name ? Olivia . How do you like that ? That 's my name too . Did you see the crash ? I heard it . Did you see anything after the crash ? 'Cause your friends said that they were out in the field but that you were here on the street . So I was kind of hoping that maybe you saw something they didn 't . I don 't want to get in trouble . Okay , you 're not gonna get into trouble , I promise . I was talking to my boyfriend . I came out to the street to get reception . What did you see ? Now we have a picture . Nice catch . Thanks . Imagine what I could do with more information . Freaky see-through killer , two apparently unrelated murders . It 's not just two . Agent Lee , I 'm Agent Phillip Broyles . What are these ? The first one raises your clearance . The second you 're acknowledging you 'll be prosecuted if you speak about what we 're seeing here . The first attacks were three days ago . All we know is their hearts stopped . All of these in three days ? We don 't know what happened to them , what he does to affect their skin this way , and what the hell he 's getting out of this . We assume there must be some common link between the victims , but we can 't find it . Different ages , races , blood types , some had high cholesterol , some didn 't . Cholesterol levels ? We 're looking for anything . Robert had Crohn 's disease . He took iron pills . We were partners for five years . He was like family . Something I never thought I 'd find . He believed that everything happened for a reason . I 'm having a hard time believing that there 's a reason for this . Mister , I think I found what you 're looking for . An electron gun from a ' 58 color RCA . I had to take apart the cathode ray tube to get to it , so I 'm gonna have to charge you full-price for the TV . Yes . I will take this as well . Mind my asking what you need all this stuff for ? I need to erase someone from time . Just there is great , guys . Thank you . Hey . Have you seen Walter ? I can 't find him . I went out to get him a sandwich , and when I got back , he was gone . Where would he go ? He 's afraid to leave the lab . Then maybe he locked himself in the bathroom again ? - I 'll check Gene 's stall . - Okay . Walter ! Is it safe to come out ? Is he gone ? Who ? The man ! Is he gone ? I don 't know . I think it 's just me and Agents Dunham and- - Oh ... There was- - there was a man in the mirror . And when I turned around , he wasn 't there . I saw him . Walter . Listen , Astrid , there is a man in the mirror . If you 're talking about Agent Lee , you met him earlier . Not him ! There was another man . He was here , and then he was gone . I saw him ! Walter , Walter , it 's okay . Look , whatever it was , we 're all here now , and you 're okay . You 're okay . Walter , look at you . You 're soaking wet . We got to get you out of those clothes . Is he all right ? Well , that depends on your definition of " all right " . He 's functional . Except when he 's not . But he is often quite brilliant . He just never had anything to tether him to the world . That is sad . What is ? Engagement ring . I don 't think there 's anything sadder than when two people are meant to be together and something intervenes . Hey , Walter , it 's okay . It 's okay . It 's just your test results . Question , dear . That man ? Agent Lee . I believe it was your idea , Agent Lee , to test each of the victims for iron-related diseases , that they may share that in common . Very clever . Wrong , but clever . Well , it was just a long shot . And yet , interestingly , they do all suffer from a variety of health problems- - gout , hair loss , kidney diseases , which , in themselves , have something in common . I 'm not wearing pants . I 'm on it . Which is what , Walter ? They 're all caused by some form of heavy metal poisoning . Lead , Zinc , Mercury . Thank you , dear . And what could that possibly mean ? I don 't know , but , with 30-odd victims , it 's unlikely that it 's a coincidence . And something else- - the levels of metal in their bodies have returned to normal . It 's as if their blood has been cleaned . So , what , you 're saying he 's taking particles from their blood ? Why ? For what possible reason ? I don 't have enough information to form a hypothesis yet . But it would seem he needs a lot of it . If Walter 's right and we assume that he is selecting these victims on purpose , then the question is , how is he identifying them ? In this case , tissue 's soft . No induration . Fat to lean muscle ratio- - ideal , about 20 % . Is that relevant ? To this case ? Not at all . It just means that she will make a lovely specimen . Finding healthy tissue for experimentation 's harder than you might imagine . You mean you aren 't returning these people to their families ? We can 't do that . Why not ? Because we can 't disclose how they were killed . The families are informed that they have gone missing , that we will continue to look for them- - you mean you lie to them . Look , I 'm sorry , but- - You understand what you 're saying ? Those families are going to spend the rest of their lives wondering what happened to their loved ones , looking for answers . Can you imagine what that would be like ? To have that ... that hole in your life . People die . It happens . Sometimes they even die twice . The reason we can 't return the bodies is because that would mean we would have to file documentation , which would draw attention to Fringe Division . And we cannot have that . It may not be a good enough answer , but it is the truth . Listen to this . One of the victims credit cards just registered a charge . Dead people do not use their credit cards . Of course they do . Certainly . So you think it 's the translucent man ? - Mm-hmm . - Can you track it ? Never mind . It 's a false alarm . It 's a commuter pass being auto-renewed as a monthly charge . The killer picked up his last victim in the commuter rail parking lot . We were wrong . Pattern 's not random at all . Four kill zones , all centered around the commuter rail stations . Astrid , call Broyles . Lee , you come with me . Tell him to get that photograph out to all the station police , and also we 're gonna need another three teams of agents to watch the stations . Where are we going ? Team one , nothing to report . Team two , all quiet here too . Team three , same . No sign of the suspect . Just so you know , I know what it 's like . I lost a partner too . About three years ago . There was an event on a plane . And at first we thought it was terrorism . During the investigations , my partner was injured . What happened to him was horrific and unexplainable . It affected his skin . Like your partner , but different . And Walter Bishop was in a mental institution at the time . I checked him out , so that he could help catch whoever did this and ... and save my partner 's life . But even Walter couldn 't save him . This is Roach . We 've got him . Grove Hall Station . He 's headed for the industrial line , back by the chemical lab . I lost him . - I lost him . - There . He 's running toward the warehouse , through the rail lines . Copy . We 're almost there . What if he goes out the other side ? You take the near side- - Frazier ! Frazier 's down . Aagh ! He 's been shot . He 's gonna bleed out if we don 't get him help . All right , go . Check the warehouse . If he 's still here , you don 't let him get away . I got this . Don 't move . Drop it . Drop- - Hey . It took- - it 's okay . You 're okay . An ambulance is on the way . It took my gun . It 's okay . It 's all over . There 's more than one . Unh ! Who are these ... Things ? What were they looking for ? I think the better question is , what are they ? Anything ? Nothing that I can make sense of . It 's all too badly burned . The spy who came in from the cold . We used to have the book at St. Claire 's . The mental hospital where I lived for- - 17 years . What about the book , Walter ? We used to read it every Wednesday . This reminds me of the book . A spy burning his things , covering his tracks . Agent Lee . Did you happen to bring any candy ? Gumdrops perhaps ? Candy ? Um , no . That 's a pity . Astrid , where are the scalpels ? Long drive . Hope the bureau 's not gonna give you a hard time about putting miles on their car . I wanted to thank you for releasing Robert 's body . I know you must have pulled some ... Significant strings . Why would you do that for me ? I know you haven 't found the answers you were looking for yet , but I hope that it brings a kind of closure , a closure that he deserves . Because of what he meant to you . Thank you . Well ... have a look at this . Does this remind you of anything ? A biological-mechanical hybrid . These are different . They 're human . And for whatever reason , they don 't work . Walter , are you suggesting that these are- - - I told you . I told you that man couldn 't be trusted . What is he talking about ? Walter , don 't jump to conclusions . We don 't know that for sure . All I do know is that this tech isn 't from here . Not from here ? You mean like China ? No . Not China . Sergeant , I need an I.D. for Agent Lincoln Lee . Yes , ma 'am . Place your hand right here , please , sir . Badge number . BMP122298 . Blood type . Uh , B-Positive . Are you currently on any medications ? No . Do you have a history of mental illness ? This is getting oddly personal . - But no . - Thank you , sir . Thank you . Just wait . Initiate scan . What is this ? Please remain still . What you said before ... I know what it 's like to have a hole in my life . It 's been there as long as I can remember . I told you about the incident on the plane . After that , Broyles asked us to join Fringe Division , and somehow I knew that this is where I would find ... What ? My answers . What 's beyond the door ? Well , sometimes answers lead to more questions . Heh . I hear you got something to show me . What is it ? It was powering a new form of shapeshifters . Shapeshifters ? Human shapeshifters . The ones we 've encountered before answered to Walternate . You were wondering why I don 't trust you . I 'll look into it . - Night , Dr. Bishop . - Night , Tommy . It 's Tim , sir . Good night , Timmy . Look how easy it is . I 'm just gonna put it in the center like this , okay , and slide it all the way through . I 'll put the platform on here . I 'll put the top on . And , as you can see ... Anybody can do this . I 'll put it in my machine and ... Set it and forget it ! 18 minutes a pound for a pork loin roast- - Oh ! Aah ! I saw him again . The man . I saw him . He was in the TV . It was the man from the mirror . = = sync , corrected by elderman = =

 Barbie : Two weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down On chester 's mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . Why the dome is here or what mysteries lie ahead , We still don 't know . Every day it tests our limits , Bringing out the best and the worst in us . Some say we 'll be stuck here forever , But we will never stop fighting to find a way out . Melanie , how did you get inside the dome ? The temperature 's dropped in the last few days . You came back . How 'd the others fare ? Lyle , he didn 't come up out of the water with the rest of us . If that 's the power source to the dome , We could all die . If you don 't , he 'll kill you . That thing 's going to zenith . It 's going now . ( gasps ) Melanie ! Phil ! He 's gone . Yeah , he 's gone . The passage closed . We 're stuck here . ( electric sizzling , crackling ) ( buzzing ) Man : What is it doing ? Put it down , now ! ( crackling , whooshing ) ( screaming ) what 's happening to her ? I don 't know , but her heart rate 's dropping again . This is james rennie . Barbie , you out there ? ( screaming ) barbie , you there ? Junior , it 's rebecca . What 's wrong ? It 's melanie . She 's in real trouble . Say we 're bringing her to the clinic . W-we 're on our way to the clinic . Don 't go to the clinic . Why not ? Rebecca : Earthquake brought down some of the ceiling . Come to the high school . We 're setting up a triage center . Hold on to her , sam . You shouldn 't have dropped the egg . It was driving you crazy . You were in pain . You think I can 't handle a little pain . Well , I was just trying to help . And , look , you 're your old self again . You don 't know who I am . I don 't think you ever knew who I am . Listen , I 'm not going to apologize You always think you 're qualified to make judgments About what other people 's best interests are . Why are we arguing ? We 're gonna get out of here . You , me and junior . Are you sure about that ? Because after what you did , It 's going to affect a lot more people Than just you , me and junior . Where 's the locker ? This way . Jim ! What gave you the right ? Easy . No , he had a plan . That egg didn 't go over the cliff Till everyone got out safely . Well , plans change . So , you put a gun on those kids ? You forced them to bring the egg to the cliff ? Hey ! He kept that egg a secret for a hell of a long time . Same thing for the tunnels . We could have had everyone out of here a week ago . Well , now no one gets out . Ever . What are you talking about ? We gave those rent-a-cops their egg , now we all get out . There 's nowhere to go , jim . What do you mean ? Right here . When you dropped that egg , You closed the passage . Only place that cliff leads to is the bottom of a ravine . The way to zenith is blocked ? Barbie : Oh , it 's more than blocked , It 's gone . Phil found that out the hard way . Phil- - he 's in jail . Yeah , well , he broke out . He jumped off of that cliff . He died at the bottom of it . Now , we 're the ones that are in jail . And you 're the one who put us here . I thought we 'd all get out . I did it for you , pauline And the people of this town . Jim ? Mrs. Rennie . Becky pine ? No one calls me becky , anymore . I am ... We all thought you were d ... Yeah , I know . It 's good to see you , rebecca . Yeah . Yeah , you , too . Much as I 'd love to catch up , There are a few slightly more pressing matters to deal with . What 's going on ? A lot of people were hurt in the quake . The clinic 's out of commission , So this high school 's a hospital now , And we need everyone 's help . Good luck with that . Start with handing out some blankets , shall we ? We may have bigger problems than the quake . The temperature 's still dropping . Yeah , I noticed . And if it continues , I can 't predict how many people Might freeze to death before morning . ( shuddering ) ( shivering ) : I wish I 'd known you were mid-glacial period When I came here from zenith . Did you pack any clothes ? No . Then , shut up . Quit complaining . Put this on . Are you sure we have to do this ? We need to see if tossing the egg over I mean , if it 's a power source , and it 's gone , Then ... Maybe the dome ... Just freezes . ( ice crackles ) I can 't get it off ! What the hell is happening ? ( grunting ) She collapsed . We 're not sure why . The rest are injuries from the quake . We lost two people already . Come here . This all happened after we dropped the egg off the cliff . We did this . No , jim did this . If he comes near you again , I 'll kill him . ... Something even weirder is happening . The dome walls are rotating . They might have started moving a while ago , We just didn 't notice . The dome might be coming down . This could be our way out . I don 't think so . The dome 's a sphere . It 's more like it 's revolving . Revolving ? Could explain the temperature drop And the clouds creeping down the side Like the upper atmosphere is being pulled down . Isn 't the air even colder up there ? Rebecca : Much colder . Hunter 's still out at the dome . He 'll tell us what 's actually happening . Pauline . Listen , I know you 're angry . But it 's not like I tried to maroon us here on purpose . I wanted us to get out of here , So we could be a family again . I understand . But your good intentions Don 't always produce good results . Hey . I dropped that egg to save you . No , you dropped that egg to save the day , To be the hero you always want to be . That 's not love , that 's narcissism . What do you want me to do , Just sit back , and let you go crazy ? Support every insane idea that you have ? Like lyle did ? Lyle would never betray me . He would never go behind my back . Do you love him ? This is not about love , jim ! Or hurt feelings . Acting without any regard for what anyone else wants . Because of what you did , I can 't paint anymore , the visions are gone , And lyle may never come back From wherever the hell he is . The dome had a plan for him . Yeah ? Well , it 's got a plan for me , too . And , like you said , when one door closes , Another one opens . You also said we 'd be a family again . I came back for my son . I told you what you needed to hear To get you out of my way . But even lying to you doesn 't work . Now , we 're all stuck here Because of how much you love me . Rebecca : I timed how fast the clouds are descending , And how fast joe said the wall is shifting , And there 's no other way to explain it , Except , the atmosphere is inverting . You sure ? Frigid high-altitude air Replacing the warm air below it . Julia : So , how do we stop it ? Rebecca : I don 't know if we can . Well , then , we have to make sure everyone 's sheltered , With adequate heat . We sent some people to the church . There 's a working generator there , gassed up . The one here is half-full , But , with the way we 're riding it , I don 't know if it will last the night . Also , we don 't have much food If we 're stuck here with no provisions , Well , there 's still a decent amount at the sweetbriar . Don 't know how secure it is , though . If it gets as cold as you think it 's going to ... We could lose it all to a freeze . Take the ambulance , fill it up with food . Sounds good . Um ... You sure barbie 's okay ? Barbie 's fine . He 'll be fine . Prius is charged up and ready to go If anyone needs it . Keep warm . Once night falls , you won 't last More than a few minutes outside Melanie : It 's hard to breathe . Junior : Can you hold off ? You 're gonna be fine . Do you mind if I sit with her for a little while ? I 'll be around . Pauline . I mean , they- - they told me you were alive , but ... Seeing you here , it-it 's amazing . You look like you did 25 years ago . I must look old . I 'd know you anywhere . My best friend . Who left me for dead . Oh , my god . Melanie . I am so sorry For what happened that night , For what they did . I should have stopped them , Gotten help , done something . It 's my fault as much as anyone 's . The egg It made that sound that scared you , Didn 't it ? Yes . It-it-it just seems Like ancient history . To me it seems Like yesterday . I missed you . Aw ... I missed you , too . We 're gonna get you well . And then we 'll figure out why you 're here . Julia : As long as none of it 's ruined , We should have enough food to get by . And what then ? I don 't know . Half the town 's not gonna make it Through this cold . The few crops we have left will be decimated . So , let 's say that no other catastrophes hit , And the food lasts longer , 'cause we 've got fewer people , What then ? You know , maybe we make it To October before we have to start deciding Who 's gonna starve to death first . We 'll figure it out . We survived this long . I 'm getting tired of survival Being the best-case scenario here . My only purpose in coming back here was to get you , Get the hell out of this place . Maybe there 's another reason . And what would that be ? ( rattling , clanking ) I better tie that down . Julia ! Hang on ! Barbie ! Julia ! ( groans ) Julia ! Can you hear me ? ( groans ) There you are . You had me worried . What happened ? We hit a patch of ice . We 're lucky to be alive . Come on . Up slowly . Ready ? ( screams ) what ? What ? What ? What ? What ? What ? Don 't move . ( groans ) okay , okay . Can you take it out ? It 's too dangerous . It might be lodged in an artery . So it might be the only thing Keeping me from bleeding to death . All right , here we go . A little pressure . ( yells ) I know ! I know . I 'm sorry . Here . Right here . All right , hold that . Got to be something in here for the pain . Can we radio anyone ? Broken . I don 't suppose we 're close enough to the sweetbriar . Not in this weather . Someone will see that we didn 't come back , They 'll come looking for us . We just wait ? That could take hours . Well , the engine 's running , so ... We 've still got heat . Till we run out of gas . Look , I don 't like this either , all right ? But , given that wound and the freezing cold Staying here , that-that 's the best of our bad options . I need to ask you a favor . Ask someone else . I need you to go talk to your mom . She 's too pissed to listen to me right now , And she 's got her reasons , okay ? But I need you to go to her , be my advocate . Why would I ever help you get her back ? Given the choice , most kids would like To see their parents back together . Mm , most kids , sure . But why do you think I never told you she was alive ? What are you talking about ? I found out a week ago . Wait , wait . You knew this a week ago ? That 's right . She didn 't want you to know . All I wanted to do was Find a way out of here , And get us both the hell away from you . But now , you 've made that impossible . Wait . I didn 't know it was going to happen . I had a plan . It didn 't work out the way I expected . I didn 't know that throwing the egg over the cliff was gonna The-the earthquake started when you dropped the egg ? Yeah . Melanie collapsed at the same time . What 's the temperature outside ? Two degrees and dropping . We 're sealing up the windows , But we 're still gonna have to crank up The heaters . It 'll use our fuel a lot faster , but ... I don 't think we have a choice . Hey ! Can you close that door ? Hunter ? Are you all right ? Yeah . You 've got frostbite . We need to wrap that up . Okay ? Thank you . You were outside the dome ? Why 'd you come back to chester 's mill ? Was it because of junior ? But that 's not the only reason . You forgot how well I know you , pauline . After that night at the crater I tried to live as full a life As I knew how to . I fell in love , I married jim , We had a son But deep inside I knew something was wrong . I knew I was running from what we did . From what I did . But I 'm done running now . And I am here to finish What you , Sam , me and lyle started 25 years ago . And this time , I 'm not leaving your side . You promise ? I promise . What do we need to do ? ( gasping ) melanie ... Sam ! Sam ? ! ( indistinct talking ) someone get sam ! Melanie ? Is she dead ? No , she has a pulse , but it 's incredibly weak . What 's happening to her ? It-it must be the egg . Melanie 's connected to it . Whatever happens to it , happens to her . Someone must be doing something to it . What 's it like out there ? It 's bad . I put the flares out So anybody that 's driving by , They 'll be able to see us . ( engine stops ) You got to be kidding me . Are we out of gas ? ( engine cranking ) ( grunting ) oh ! Come on ! Go . You can make it to the diner . No , you 'd freeze before I got back . Better one than both of us . No ! I 'm not leaving here without you . What are you looking for ? This . Petroleum jelly ? This is going to save our lives . As long as we can keep the cold air out . Yeah , it is . This is gonna hurt like hell once the numbness wears off . But , doctor , will I ever be able to play the piano again ? You were out there for a long time . I got lost . Did you know that there 's a " little bitch road " Yeah , it used to be the most exciting thing About chester 's mill . Hey , can I ask you a question ? Something I just never understood . The egg is the power source of the dome , right ? Yeah , as far as we know . Yeah , but when you moved it , The dome didn 't move with it . It 's a technology we don 't understand . But you guys moved it , Didn 't you ? And when that big jim guy And his silver pick in back to the future . So ... Are you the only ones who ... ? You 're asking a lot of questions . Why so much interest in the egg ? I 'm just curious , boss . Man : Help ! Help ! Somebody help my wife ! Set her down , set her down . Guys , move ! Move ! Excuse me , excuse me . Rebecca : Norrie , get some blankets . We made a fire to stay warm , But I fell asleep , and when I woke up , she was ... And I couldn 't get the car started , And I ... ( whimpers ) I 'm not getting a pulse . Oh , my god . Please help her ! Please ! I 'm sorry , tom . No ... This can 't be happening . ( whimpering ) : Oh , geez ... We were just ... Just having a fire ... I understand . I 'm sorry . Sorry , I underst ... Rebecca , what 's going on ? We just ran out of fuel . Get everybody in here or the gym . Extra body warmth will help . We need to move the equipment aside , And bring in the cots , okay ? Is this enough ? For everyone healthy , probably , But all those who are sick ? I don 't know . Where are you going ? We need fuel for the generators . I 'm gonna go find some . It 's too cold to go out and search blindly . Who said anything about " blindly " ? This is my town . I know where to look . Take julia 's car . We 've siphoned the gas out of everyone else 's . Julia : A single candle Can really keep us alive ? You 'd be surprised how much heat One candle can give off . All right . ( breathing heavily ) okay . ( shuddering ) okay . You know , if I didn 't have A giant piece of metal sticking into my leg , This might almost be romantic . Mmm . So , what 's going on with you ? What do you mean ? You 're acting like you 're losing hope . We had a way out of here , julia . We 're not gonna get another one . So , we 'll spend the rest of our lives here . ( wry laugh ) We 'll make the best of it . ( glass cracking ) ( grunts ) shh ... What was that ? ( crackling ) Look out ! ( panting ) I 'm not sure she can take another attack like this . If whoever 's got the egg keeps messing with it . How can the thing somehow bring her back to life Now let her slip away ? Norrie ? You gonna check on her ? Maybe you should go . Rebecca asked me to check all the windows for drafts Around the school . We can 't stay here . And you can 't leave . Then leave without me . Wrap up as best you can and go . No . If you leave now , you can make it . I said ... Barbie . I 'm not leaving without you . I ... I would rather die alone , knowing you were okay , Than be a little bit warmer A little bit longer . Please . We 're gonna find a way out of here . How ? I don 't know . It 's so cold . That 's it . What ? You know what happens with hypothermia ? Your heart slows down . It stops pumping . And you can pull the rod out Without me bleeding to death . And I can get us both to the sweetbriar . I 'll be gone by then . People can come back from hypothermia . Good . Yeah , good . Simple . ( laughs ) You 're not leaving me . Not for good . You ready ? ( grunts ) Oh , god . ( winces ) Big jim : Becca , you there ? Here . All right , been to the market and two farms . Struck out on fuel so far . You coming back ? Yeah , I 'm just gonna check These two boats at the lake . Unless you want Some serious frostbite , For more than a few minutes at a time . So , don 't linger out in the cold , Is that what you 're saying ? Thanks for the help . ( grunting ) Bingo . Lyle : Help ! ( gurgling ) : Help ! What the holy hell ? Jim ! Lyle ? Please ! Jim ! Please , jim ! Please ! ( grunts ) Oh , god . Melanie 's gonna die . You don 't know that for sure . And it 's all my fault . No . I never should 've Let big jim knock that egg out of my hand . He had a gun on you and joe . I should 've just let him kill me . And everyone could 've gotten out , And now we 're really stuck . ( sighs ) Now whoever has that egg can do whatever they want to it , And we can 't get it back and we can 't even tell them to stop . Maybe someone in zenith Will figure out how to make it work . How ? There 's only a few people who can touch the egg . And they 're all inside the dome . Really ? Yeah . And it 's all my fault . Maybe I should go see if anyone needs help . It seems like that is all you do . Help people . ( sighs ) I 'm sorry you got stuck in here . But it 's actually nice having you around , you know ? Thanks . ( lyle shivering , panting ) big jim : Get in . Thank you . Thank you . ( grunts ) ( shuddering , gasping ) How long was I gone ? Your friends got back a few days ago . Oh . Hey , jim ? Jim . You got to listen to me . The whole world ... Was on fire . There were waves of flames A thousand feet up , Circling endlessly . Destroyed everything ... Everything was just ... That 's impossible , lyle . No , it 's not . I saw it . ( exhales ) It was beautiful . You should start thinking about where you want to be At the end of the world , jim . 'cause the end is coming . And there 's nothing you can do . I don 't need to think about it , lyle . I want to be with my family . It 's like falling asleep . I 'm gonna wake you up so soon . It 's okay ... If you don 't . I will . I ... I can 't see you . I 'm right here , baby . Keep talking to me . You 're just gonna go to sleep ... And then you 're gonna wake up . Then we 're gonna have a life together . We 're gonna have love . And kids . Everything . We 're gonna have Anything that you want . Love you , too . ( panting , sniffles ) Okay . Stay with me . ( panting ) Okay . All right . Now listen to me . You don 't get to leave me yet . We got too many things to do . All right , baby . All right . Okay , Here we go . Here we go . ( panting ) Stay with me . Stay with me . Hey ! Need a little help here ! ( coughing ) Is that lyle ? Yeah . Fished him out of the lake . Lyle : Waves of flames ... A thousand feet up ... Did you find any fuel ? Yes , I did . It 's in the car . I think it 's enough to get us through the night . Hey , jim . Yeah . Thank you . ( exhales , grunts ) okay , baby . Okay . ( grunts ) We made it . We made it , baby . Almost there . ( panting ) ( whispering ) : Baby , it 's time to wake up now . ( panting ) ( quivering ) ( panting ) Okay . ( grunting ) Come on , come on . Come on , come on , Come back for me . Come back for me now , come on . ( whimpers ) ( panting , sniffles ) ( lightly gasps ) ( quiet gasps , whimpers ) Barbie ... ? Shh ... Easy , baby . What happened ? I 've missed you . I was so calm . I was so ... ( panting ) : So cold . Come here . Come here . It 's gonna be okay . We 're gonna be okay . You guys , come here . Temperature 's rising . That 's part of it , but the barometric pressure- - It 's higher than it should be . Something 's changed . What ? But as quickly as things happen in here ? We 'll find out soon enough . Hey , where 'd hunter go ? Better follow him and find out . Why ? I saw something he didn 't want me to see . I was at that game , you know . I saw you block that field goal . You won that game for the mighty , mighty woodchucks . ( soft chuckle ) Well , I ... I blocked a kick , but ... I didn 't score any touchdowns . That 's not how you used to tell it . ( laughs quietly ) Don 't let the truth get in the way of a good story . So lyle 's back . Back from his , uh , travels Through space and time . He 's safe . And , uh , well ... Not all that sound . Why did you do it , jim ? Why did you save him ? Isn 't it obvious , pauline ? I did it for you . 'cause you said you need him . Look , I haven 't always been the best ... Husband . Or father . I can admit that . But it isn 't because I didn 't care Or wasn 't trying . It 's just the opposite . Everything I 've done , I 've done for my family . For you . I 'll do whatever it takes to protect the people I love . ( sighs ) It 's getting warm outside now . Looks like we 'll make it another day . Yeah , looks like . I used to love coming to your games . Even if you weren 't catching touchdowns . Stop , joe , there he is . I told you he wasn 't on our side . I trusted him . What the hell are you doing ? ! I 'm trying to help . Liar . We saw your phone . You 're working for the guy Who held us captive over the egg . Why are you here ? Look , they sent me here to report back to them About the egg . He 's been monitoring it Tell him ? Just read it for yourself , all right ? You told them to stop messing with the egg ? Whatever they 're doing to it in zenith is Obviously killing melanie in here , And I couldn 't let that happen . But why ? I hate those guys . I never wanted to help them in the first place . They forced me to . How ? I have ... You know , a bit of a record You think that guy will tell ' em to stop Doing whatever they 're doing with the egg ? I am the only one they 've got on the inside . They better listen to me . What the hell is that ? ! I don 't know- - The dome 's never made that sound before . It 's starting . ( grinding stops ) ( low electric hum ) It stopped spinning . ( hum ) ( hum ) ( thud ) ( rumbling ) ( all stammering , gasping ) Uh , why 's that happening ? Because the dome 's contracting . You mean it 's shrinking ? But if it doesn 't stop , then ... Then it 'll kill us all . Captioned by media access group at wgbh access.Wgbh.Org

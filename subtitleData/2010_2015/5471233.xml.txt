ELlOSVALDO - tourist guide , TRANSLATOR , GENERAL ASSlSTENT How are you doing , boss ? Would you like to shine your shoes ? No , boy . Leave the man alone , okay ? How much is it ? It made your day , boy ! He said the next time you 'll shine his shoes . - Mr . Raimundo . - Eliosvaldo . This is Mr. Thomas Mathews . He 's here to investigate the UFOs . Please prepare his file . OCTOBER 12TH , 2009 Mr. Raimundo , please get him a nice room . Thank you . This way . Guys , I 'm going to get some images and get back with you later . Wait , wait , I 'll go with you . Me too . Tell him that this spot right there ... gets always hotter . He said he is not surprised because this place is so hot that ... it is 40 degrees in the shade . So , what 's not supposed to be hot ? Do you feel any Jasmine smell , Josias ? He wants you to explain how this thing appeared here . I was home , getting ready for bed ... when I heard a strange noise . I ran out here . I just saw a brightlight . imagine a really brightlight . It was a ... white light with an orange tint . It stopped here , right above here . Then it disappeared there , behind the mountain . Thank you . Thank you , Josias . - Hello . - Hello . I was very sick . The doctors said I was terminal . There was nothing else to be done . Poor my mother who only cried and prayed . Honey , I 'll bring your breakfast in a minute . It was a miracle from Jesus Christ ! - l had the feeling ... - Thank you . only a few minutes had passed ... but when I returned ... it was morning . Did you see or feel anything ? The light , the light was very bright . I opened my eyes for just a few seconds ... and I saw the mountain in front of me . I felt like I was gently touched by the hand of an angel . I drank a liquid that made my entire body tingle . It tasted like the purest water I 've ever tasted . It was the work of God ! My prayers were answered . God didn 't want to take her . She didn 't deserve this , she has a good heart . Sweetie , tell him about your work with the elderly at the nursing home . No , mom . And I felt another thing . There was a strong smell of Jasmine all the time . Was it really Jasmine 's smell ? What is he saying , Eliosvaldo ? He 's puzzled about the scent of Jasmine . Jasmine scent ? It 's a sign of Saint Paulina 's presence . She protects those with cancer . So you felt well the next morning ? As if I had never been sick before . He appreciates your time . Where did this mark on your hand come from ? I came back with it after I disappeared . Eliosvaldo . Maria ... is the baby from the alien ? No , it 's from my boyfriend . - Bye . Bye . - Congratulations , Maria . Congratulations . Bye , thanks . Bye . Excuse me , lady . Let me ask you ... this whole story about Joao Batista ... Do you know anything about it ? Yes , sir. I do . I pray for Joao Batista every night . We already sent letters to the Archbishop of Sao Salvador ... because we want him to be sainted . And I pray for Maria das Gracas too . I 'm sure she came back as a saint . I myself , think that Joao Batista is crazy . He used to get lost among these bushes , took too much sun in his head ... and came back telling this story that he had seen UFOs ... Give me a break ! Joao batista and those mountain stories are all insanity ! It 's something to attract tourists to the city ... to make them spend money to see aliens here . It 's a dirty politician 's scheme to promote the town . Yes , son . You don 't play with those things . I don 't even go near that mountain . Hail Mary . There 's something in it . - lt 's a dirty politician 's scheme ... - l myself , think Joao Batista is crazy . Thanks , Mr. Raimundo . Hi . Raimundo , hello . This is my son . Tell him that Joao Batista was a great man . Please . My husband was chosen by them . He went to work as he did everyday ... and when he came back seven days later , he said that a light had taken him . He came back a changed man . He said that he was growing younger ... and that he had a very important mission to fulfill . What type of mission was it ? He kept saying about a new vision to the world . And a renewal . And what did he mean by that ? I don 't know , boy . That 's too complicated for me . After a few months he disappeared again . Judith , ma 'am , how do you cope with not having him for 30 years ? I 'm pretty sure he is coming back . How can you be sure ? I dream a lot about him . It is like he was here with me . He said he 'll come back ... He is really younger and more handsome ... and his presence comforts me . Tell him that my son made this drawing . He made it to his father the day he dissapeared for the first time . What did he say ? Give me you blessing , mom . My son . How is it , sir ? - Hello , Junior . - How are you , man ? Pleased to meet you . - What did you say ? - He said he saw you last night . No , not me . What ? He saw you last night and talked to you . Do you speak English ? No , I do not , man . What 's that ? I ... don 't . He said he saw you last night at the mountain , you talked to him . No , it 's that ... I was in my girlfriend 's house last night . What 's happening , man ? Really ? You came here for answers , I 'm giving you answers . It was a vision from a possible future . Because people will become insensitive ... to a point that they 'll hunt abandoned children as if they were stray dogs . Lack of water ... food . The devastation caused by the mankind will decrease population substantially . Disorder will take place . You 'll slave children in order to keep productivity . It 's survival of the fittest . You already are very insensitive . Thousands of children die every day because of hunger and lack of shelter . You are heading towards a collapse . That 's why we have to intervene . Your son is only one of many thousands . This town is one of many others . Peter has been growing younger for the past few years . He is ready and just waiting his turn to come back . The chosen ones are being prepared . They are given important knowledge and skills . They would be returned faster if so many pregnancies weren 't terminated . To reverse the direction you are heading . They 're going to lead the world with a new vision ... new ideas and even new technology . They will be leaders who will change the way society interacts . The world will have a legion of exceptionally gifted people ... practicing and spreading charity , honesty and good over all . But they are your last hope . Imagine a world filled with thousands of Ghandis ... Chico Xaviers ... Nelson Mandelas , Mother Teresas , Martin Luther Kings ... You don 't need much to change . Only will power . Your natural resources are vital to keep the harmony in this universe . You 're here for a reason , Thomas . There are no coincidences . They will come back to lead the masses and change your future for the better . Someone has to make sure they live up to their potentials . Peter will need your guidance when he comes back . 8 ? 29 ' 4 " N ... 13 ? 14 ' 3.8 " W. You better memorize it . Be there in 2011 . That 's when you 'll start your mission . Time ... is only a matter of perception . Hello . My keys , please . OCTOBER 16TH , 2010 Please , lend it to me . SATURDAY , OCTOBER 16TH , 2010 When I returned ... it was morning . Thank you . The last time I saw this woman was when Mr. Thomas disappeared . She had disappeared too , isn 't it ? The police told me she 's not a reporter . Maybe she was the one who had Mr. Thomas kidnapped . Do you think so ? We have to check on this , man . Turn around . Please , turn around . high tension THE GREATEST TRAGEDY ... is NOT THE strident CLAMOR OF THE BAD PEOPLE ... BUT THE appalling silence OF THE GOOD PEOPLE . martin LUTHER king , JR .

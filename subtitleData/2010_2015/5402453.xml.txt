 Oh , you think you 're bad ? Check this ! Yes ! Numero uno , baby ! No evos to fight , no Six looking over my shoulder , and no way this day could possibly get any ... Better . Oh , man , Bobo would be so jealous if he knew I slipped out for this . Good thing my nanites can 't talk . But if they could talk , they 'd be telling me that 's not good . Hello ? Hey ! Get back here ! Oh , brought a friend , huh ? Make that friends . Big ones . I don 't know who you evos think you are , but you just surrounded the wrong Providence agent . Um , you 're not evos . Ooh , ain 't he the clever one ? ♪ So make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way ♪ ♪ we 're gonna have fun tonight ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ ♪ so make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ Oof ! Ouch . Whoa ! You guys don 't fight like humans . But neither do I. Aaaah ! I-V ! Let ' er rip ! Take him out , Trey . - Whoo-hoo ! - Oh , boy . Huh ? Who are you ? Just tell the blokes at the hospital that Five sent you . Aah ! All yours , Dos . Claro que si . ¿ Eres de Mexico ? España ! Aah ! Not half bad , really . I 've seen better moves on a chess board . Well , I thought he was pretty good , y 'all . Sí . But is he good enough ? Yes , and that 's why we 're taking him with us . Six ? Six , what are you ... And then I said to the general , " Your surrender I can accept , but there is no excuse for that haircut . " Blimey , Dos . You told the same story last time . And it wasn 't very funny then , either . Well , forgive me for trying to pass the time . We may ride in silence , if you prefer . Dat fine by me . I like the sound them engine make . b ... bl ... bl ... bl ! Like that . You do realize that you sound like a complete blockhead ? Ignore her , Trey . Five is obviously still bitter about the Malaysian job . We 're all still bitter about the Malaysian job . Not like I can pick up a new one of these at pinkie mart . The past is past . We must focus on the task before us . Which is what , exactly ? Six , please tell me this is some sort of whacked-out , top-secret Providence mission . So let me get this straight ... You 've gone AWOL - with a bunch of weirdos ... - Hey ! Who you calling weird , big hands ? Who attacked your partner , and now you 're abducting that partner in a stolen jet ? I 'd say that sums it up . Why ? What 's going on , and who are these people ? Have you ever wondered why they call me " Six " ? 'Cause that 's how many seconds you have to answer my question ? It 's because I 'm the sixth most dangerous man on the planet . Meet Two through Five . Trey , Five , Dos , and I-V . It 's like a Roman four . I 'm not stupid . And it still doesn 't explain why you let them attack me and knock me out . The gas was a bit much . Eh , force of habit . Eh , I breathe that stuff for breakfast . As for the rough and tumble , how else was we supposed to see your bag of tricks ? Ho , we can 't take no amateur where we 're goin ' , no . Okay , so where are we going ? There . Okay , for the record , you could have just asked for my help . By the way , there are five people more dangerous than you ? How is that possible ? Who decides the order , and where 's number one ? Not far . Is he gonna try to kill me , too ? Very probably . One has turned evo , and you 're the only one who can save him . Dos ! Lend us a hand , love . Like you lent me a hand in Buenos Aires ? I take it you guys aren 't exactly one big happy family . We all care about the same thing . Oh , you care , do you ? Is that why you haven 't gone to see him in months ? My work is important . Mines is , too . Fighting a planetwide plague ranks just a bit higher than breaking arms and legs for ... You tell our secrets , we 'll tell yours . How 's he doing ? Not well . He 's been using meditation and physical discipline to fight the disease . But he 's losing ... bad . Then it 's a good thing I 'm here . If nanites are the disease , then I 'm the ... aah ! Cure . This is a joke , Six . The bad kind that 's not funny . Like a knock-knock joke ? Shut it ! Who dat ? ! I - V is right . It 's a fool 's errand . This boy cannot possibly save a man like ... This " boy " has faced things that would make you people run and hide . Nice house . We built it when One learned he was sick . He wanted a failsafe . If he doesn 't enter a code every 41 minutes , the house drops , along with anyone in it . So the fact that the house is still here ... Means there 's still hope . So , do we knock or ... Everybody back ! One , it 's me . We 're here , all of us ... And we brought help . It 's even worse than before . He 's too far gone . We 're just wasting our time . Then leave . How long has he been fighting it ? Five years . Most people go out of control in five minutes . One isn 't most people . Oh , I guess he like that scented candle I sent to him . Honestly , Trey , every time you open your mouth ... I brought someone . I know you don 't like strangers here , but I thought we could make an exception . This is Rex . I think he can help . But you have to let him . Do you understand ? Training and discipline have taken him as far as they can . Now he needs a cure . He needs you . - What have you done ? ! - I didn 't even ... Trey ! The chain ! Oh ! He is gone . And unless one of you chumps knows his code , this place is going into the soup . Run ! Well , obviously ! Aah ! Aah ! Grab on ! - Told you the kid was a bad idea . - I didn 't even touch him . I can do this . We just have to catch up to him . Come on , it 's an island . How far can he go ? Rex is right . We have to go after him . We have to try . That is not the only option . No ! He can still be saved . He 's heading east . I don 't want him hurt . That 's entirely up to him . They can 't hold him long . I work fast , remember ? Okay , uh , this might ... Sting a little . It 's working . Hoo ! Dat 's what I was goin ' to say . That 's right . Almost ... huh ? No ! I told you . No ! Hurry . They 've still got him . You can try again . It won 't matter , Six . He 's incurable . I 'm sorry . Then we 'll do what we should have done in the first place . We 'll handle this our way . Stop ! Aah ! Your plan did not work . This is the only option . Killing our teacher was never an option . Even if Rex can 't cure him , we can still help . We 've heard about your petting zoo . He 's not an animal ! One would sooner die than live in a cage . And no cage could hold him . Let me try again . Please . There 's got to be something I can do . No ! One is gone . That thing is not him anymore ... just an abomination that must be destroyed . That man gave me a home when I had nothing . He trained me . He took care of me . And now I am gonna take care of him . Sorry , love , but I think you 're outvoted . I voted twice . This was never a democracy . Rex , save One ! Get him out of here before they ... Aah ! Come on ! Follow me ! One ! Rex to Providence . Request emergency evac ... And a really big cage ! Rex to Providence ! Any agents on this frequency , please respond . This is agent hall with recon 35 . Changing course to intercept . ETA , five minutes . Could I talk you down to Four ? Gotta be honest ... I was kind of hoping for a rematch . Step aside , hijo . Don 't make us hurt you , love . Come on . We 're just tryin ' to do the right thing , eh ? Like Six told you ... Forget Six . Look at him , kid . He 's just a monster now . You know we 're right . All I know ... is I trust Six . Aaah ! This time , no mercy . Huh ? That 's your problem , Dos ... no mercy . Six ! Aaah ! That 's new . Been saving it for a special occasion . Oh , no , y 'all didn 't ! Huh ? So , does this make me one of the most dangerous people on the planet ? What number am I ? Hang on , One . Help is on the way . They 'll never make it in time . Six , stand back . Rex , enough . Aaaaaaah ! I had a coonhound sounded like dat . I called her Daisy . One more word out of you ... Six . One ? You left this place , quit life as a mercenary , and so rarely returned to visit . I did what I felt was right . I ... I never meant to dishonor ... So rarely that I never had time to tell you ... How proud you 've made me . We 're going to help you . We 're going to take you home . But , Six , I am home . He 's still One . He 's just one with everything . So , does this mean you 're the new number one ? - No . - Aw , why not ? You kicked all their butts . I mean , with an assist from a certain incredibly cool and handsome young agent , but , you know , who 's counting ? Come on ! You beat everyone ! Why doesn 't that make you the new number one ? We 're not ranked by who 's the best fighter . We 're ranked by who 's the most dangerous . There was a time when I wanted to be number one , and I was well on my way . - So , what happened ? - I met you . Now , I believe I owe you a hamburger . - Hungry ? - Always . Can we make it a double ?

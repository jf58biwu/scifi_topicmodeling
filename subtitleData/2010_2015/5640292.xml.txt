 Previously , on Warehouse 13 ... You killed my friend . An alchemist used a stone to keep my body from aging . If I blow your heart out of your chest , do you think that will stop you ? I 'm gonna guess that 's Charlotte . No ! Myka ! A poisoned dart . A 15-year-old boy ? Yeah . Nick Powell . Why don 't you come back to South Dakota with us ? Nick . Hey . How 's it going , man ? We could be looking at ovarian cancer . - Hey , Myks . - Hey . - What are you doing up ? - It 's time for my 3 : 00 AM sandwich . - It 's 1 : 00 AM . - I 'm still on East Coast time . What 's your excuse ? Oh , wait . No , no . No , no , no , no , no . Let me guess . You 're re-reading the manual ... again . Do you remember our first night here ? It was all so new and exciting . A world of endless wonder . I 'm just so glad that we got to see it . Okay , what 's wrong ? Pete , I have cancer . No . No . You went to the doctor three days ago , and--and you 're just telling me now ? [ Mocking ] I have cancer . [ Overlapping ] You 're just telling me now ? Myka , are you gonna die ? [ Laughs ] Myka ? Is something wrong ? What ? No . Ha . No , I was just thinking about ... stuff . Let 's go get you your sandwich . Yeah . Shh . - Shh . We can 't wake up Pete . - Why ? Because I 'm starving . I 'm about to steal his 3 : 00 AM sandwich . - Okay . - Hey , Claud . Uh , Steve was looking for you earlier . Yeah . No , I gathered from his copious texts , emails , and phone calls . - Hello ! - Oh , so close ! Why aren 't you asleep ? Sleep is for suckers , okay ? It 's hoagie time up in here . Ah , listen , we got a ping ! A big one ! This is something I 've been after a long time . This is an old--Nick ? You 're here ... listening . Yeah , uh , Claudia and I just got back- - That 's nice . It 's late . You look tired . I th- - I thought you told me you would find a place for him that was not here . Well , yeah , I mean , there aren 't a lot of alternatives to foster care for a kid like Nick . I 've got a little more digging to do , but- - Then good , go dig . And listen , in case nobody 's ever told you this the Warehouse happens to be a secret ! Oh , good . Thank you . Let me warm that up for you . - Whoa , whoa ! No ! - Sucker . Come on , let 's go , let 's go , let 's go . Wait , is there any way that this ping could wait until tomorrow ? No , no , can 't wait . I 've been waiting for years . We have to act right now . Or what , you won 't make Warehouse employee of the month ? Of the century ! Listen , we let this slip through our fingers right now , we may never get it again . Or worse , somebody could swoop in and claim it . Swoop in and claim what ? It 's the treasure of Roaring Dan Seavey . - Roaring D--who ? - He 's a pirate . A pirate who stole a collection of artifacts from Warehouse 12 . And we are gonna steal them back . During the transition between Warehouse 12 and Warehouse 13 the HMS Avalon , which was a cargo ship , was laden with artifacts . It was besieged off the Atlantic Coast by pirates . Led by Roaring Dan Seavey , these brigands looted the Avalon , absconding with several crates of artifacts and claiming the life of Agent David Wolcott . [ Chuckles ] Oh , man . Killed by a pirate ? That 's how I wanna go out . Ooh ! So whatever happened to Dan Seavey ? Vanished for 100 years . No Warehouse agent has ever been able to find him or the artifacts that he stole . But I have a lead . This is 1 / 2 of a puzzle box that was actually built by Roaring Dan . I , 18 years ago , borrowed it from the Smithsonian . And I know that when the two halves of the box are put together , it will somehow reveal where his hideout is . Now , when you say " borrowed " - - And Dan was notoriously pa--no . Paranoid about the location and protecting his stash . So I 'm assuming that your lead is the other half of that puzzle box ? Yes , that 's right . I managed to trace it to a black market dealer in antiquities , and I finally convinced him to let us buy his half . Ha ! One condition . We have to meet this dealer in Upstate New York in exactly five hours or the deal is off . Why so small a window ? Well , black market dealers , they tend to be a little skittish . They don 't want to give time for their buyers to bring the authorities . But now we need to get a move on and shuffle off to Buffalo . Ah , yes , Buffalo . Birthplace of the hot wing . Healthiest part of the chicken . [ Yawns ] Well , well , well . She lives . Mm . What is all this stuff and does it have anything to do with me ? Backlog mission reports and , no , I drew the short straw , - but you 're welcome to help . - Mm . Pass . Oh , by the way , thanks for maxing out my voice , text , and data plans , Mr. Cyber Stalker . Well , if I was stalking you I would have known where you were at 1 : 00 in the morning . I took Nick to a Dead Rent concert , and it 's a long drive back from Featherhead , mom . Still , wouldn 't have killed you to call . Okay . You , sir , are in an official snit . What gives ? - It 's Nick . - What about him ? He 's been here three days , and I still haven 't heard an honest word from him . Even a simple question like " Where are you from ? " He dodges it like a bullet . Huh . A kid from the streets lying to an adult he just met . That never happens . You need to be more careful around him . He 's 15 and homeless . He 's withdrawn , guarded , mistrustful . Three of my best friends at that age . And I get that you wanna protect him . I do . All I 'm saying is just ... Keep your eyes open , okay ? And do you think you could maybe be a little more older brother and less big brother ? Mm-hmm . Okay , deal . Now I must go bathe in caffeine . Was everything all right ? [ English accent ] I 'm in , aren 't I ? I 'll text you when we 're a go . This one can 't be traced . And don 't forget to floss , dear . Yes , mother . [ Mysterious music ] ♪ ♪ 4x18 Lost Found Can you sense it ? Can you feel it ? We 're this close to solving an historic Warehouse mystery . I don 't know , kind of a strange place to be selling a priceless antiquity . You 're right , we should be looking for a quaint little storefront- - ye olde black market . Any idea what this dealer looks like ? No , but when we find him , my name is Mr. Fisher . - You got it ? Fisher . - Fisher . Fisher . That 's him . It 's on . [ Birds chirping ] Agent Jinks , hey , just the guy I want to see . Um , you got a sec ? I 'm kind of busy , Nick . Maybe later ? Next time you feel like calling me a liar , why don 't you just do it to my face ? Okay , so ... Claudia told you about our conversation . - It 's just- - - ' Cause you 're right . I haven 't been honest with you . I 'm really sorry . You guys have been like ... really nice . And I 'm not used ... to people being nice . What I am used to is lying ... stealing ... getting beaten up and not being able to trust another living soul for what feels like 500 years , and I- - I 'm just--I 'm so- - so damned tired of it . All I want is for , like , a normal life . That 's the first honest thing you 've said to me in three days . Oh ! Uh , okay . We 're doing this now . Uhh . [ Sniffling ] I 'm--I 'm sorry . Um ... I 'm sorry that I 've been a pain in the ass . Um , can I , like , buy you lunch or something ? My treat . Well , Claudia gave me the money , but ... Well , thanks , but I got paperwork . Yeah , looks like mountains of it . Yep , never ends . You 're here for the puzzle box . - Mr. Nielsen . - My name is Fisher . I can verify that . Clyde Fisher . Woman : Your name is Arthur Nielsen . We know that voice . Pete Lattimer . Myka Bering . Charlotte Dupres . What the hell are you doing here ? I 've come to make a deal . Roaring Dan Seavey 's puzzle box . Exquisite , isn 't it ? It 's kind of a coincidence that you have it , don 't you think , Char ? I collect items of historical significance , Mr. Lattimer . And what a storied past lies behind this little beauty . Could we just please move this along ? When we last met , you people broke into my home . You stole from me . And , oh , yes ... You shot me , which might explain my being cautious . Okay , you started it with the shotgun . Nevertheless , if you want my half , it 's going to cost you . Good , fine- - what 's the price ? Oh , no , no , I 'm not interested in chump change , Mr. Nielsen . No , no , I have got my eye on a far greater prize . What do you want ? Dan Seavey was one of the most successful pirates of his time . His unrecovered fortune would be worth , whew , tens of millions today . But , you see , I need your half of the puzzle box to get it . - We don 't have the puzzle box . - I don 't have it . Oh , please . It was stolen from the Smithsonian 18 years ago by a man wielding a ray gun , which , at the time , sounded positively absurd , until you two zapped me with one ! So ... thought I 'd put my half up for sale and see if I could smoke you out . Oh , f-fine ! We have half the puzzle box ! Our half , not for sale . Hmm . Thought as much . But , you see , I would be willing to combine our respective halves and split Dan 's fortune 50 / 50 . Now , you can 't say that 's not fair . Partners ? - Can we just- - - Wait , wait , wait . Whoa , whoa , whoa . - We 'll just- - - Give us a second . - Here we go , here we go . No , no , hold on . Hold on . You 're not seriously considering this , are you ? Yes , I am . She holds the key to the lost artifact . Those artifacts have stayed lost for 100 years . I know . They will keep for another 100 . No , no , you don 't understand . Listen- - Listen to me . This woman is clearly a liar . Listen , there is a reason that she has dragged us here to Buffalo . I 'm telling you , the wings are legendary . Put some ranch dressing on ' em- - Will you- - Hey ... Just- - just stay cool . Listen to me . Roaring Dan targeted chips from the Atlantic to the Great Lakes . And Charlotte must have evidence that his stash is somewhere in this region . We cannot risk her finding the artifacts without us there . Keep your enemies closer . [ Sighs ] Yes . And don 't worry ... She won 't be with us for very long . All right , Ms. Dupres . Partners . So ... where were we ? We were partners . Where the hell have you been ? Well , Artie wouldn 't stop at a single Denny 's . [ Laughing ] You have it everywhere . [ Chuckles ] Ah , what would I do without you ? Okay , wait a minute . There 's that look again . Myka , what 's- - what 's wrong ? On my physical , the doctor found something . I have cancer . No ! Myka , Myka , Myka , Myka , Myka . [ Laughs ] Earth to Myka . Why do you keep zoning out on me ? What is with you today ? Nothing . No . There 's- - there 's nothing wrong . Let 's just stay focused on the mission . No , not until you tell me what 's wrong . Pete , just forget it , okay ? Pete ... Myka , come here and look at this . Come here , come here , come here , come here . Look at this . [ Laughs ] I gotta say , I 'm very excited . [ Mechanical whirring ] What the hell ? What is that , the ... Combination to Davy Jones ' locker ? No , I think it 's , uh ... longitude and latitude . They 're coordinates . [ Whirring and clicking ] [ Clicking ] No . No ! So , what , is this puzzle box a one-shot deal ? Wait a minute . Tell me you got it . You have to ask ? [ Thunder rumbling ] Okay , this is about as specific as it gets . It 's somewhere within 100 yards of here . Looks like somebody was a bit too literal about taking his secrets to the grave . It 's a good place to hide a lifetime of plunder . All right , we 're gonna cover more ground if we split up . Charlotte , you two go that way and just shout if you find anything . - You do the same . - All right . - Hey , Artie . - Yeah ? We 're not gonna have to dig up any dead bodies , are we ? 'Cause I promise you , it only looks cool in the movies . Yeah . Dan put the coordinates in the puzzle box for a reason . There 's gotta be something here . All right , Pete , you check that way . Yeah . [ Thunder rumbling ] Artie ... What ? Jonathan P. Tann . That was the name of his first mate , right ? - Yeah . - Seaman . Yeah . Mm , please . His headstone , it 's not made of stone . No , this is molded concrete . A more secure puzzle box , perhaps . Auguste Rodin 's sculpting tools . They have the power to reveal shapes hidden inside objects . Hey , how come that bag always has exactly- - Ah , ah , ah , ah . You 'll jinx it . Well , that doesn 't look like a treasure . Looks like an electric meter . " N-F-P-C " - - Shh . First , we have to lose Charlotte and the giant . And then- - [ Electricity buzzing ] Aagh ! What the hell ? [ Buzzing ] Aah ! Uhh ! I knew I couldn 't trust you . Thank you , Lars , and thank you , Warehouse 13 . Hey . Okay . So which would you prefer , Sandy beaches or rocky mountains ? Because I just found two kick-ass youth shelters - in Miami and- - - Whatever . The sooner I get away from your partner , the better . What ? Why ? What happened ? Steve and I just got into it something fierce . That seems ... God , he said he 'd be cool . Well , I guess not . And no matter what I say , that guy 's never gonna believe me . Hey ... [ Scoffs ] Let me handle him , okay ? Come here . [ All grunting ] Well , that was shocking . Duplicitous minx ! She double-crossed my double-cross . Look , we know where she went , though , right ? I mean , uh , NFPC . Niagara Falls Power Company . Construction began in 1897 , the same period that Roaring Dan was active in this area . I think his stash has gotta be be buried under here . Ah , an uber-rich loner with a secret underground lair . Right ? Like who is this guy , Spider-Man ? What ? Oh , my God , no ! Spider-Man lives in Queens with his aunt . Batman- - Pete , moderate your Comic-Con panel later ! - What 's Comic-Con ? - [ Whimpers ] Whoa . You know what I think ? Nikola Tesla designed a lot of this . - Hey , guys . - Yeah ? These--these meter thingies . They look just like the one that was in that headstone . You know what ? You 're right . And I 'll bet one of these is the key to Dan 's hideout . Guys , I think Charlotte already found it . Wonder if ... [ Strange whining sound ] [ Clang ] - [ Gasps ] - Avast , me hearties . Let 's go snag us some arr-tifacts . Yes , indeed . [ Laughs ] Yeah , just tell him that Steve Jinks called . Thanks . Hey ... I was just about to come looking for you . - What 's up ? - You know , I think you and I need to have some serious words about Nick . Sure , but ... Is that alarm coming from your computer ? That sounds like the intruder alert you told me you set up . [ Faint pinging ] We gotta get to the Warehouse . If Charlotte got here ahead of us , she could have already found the Warehouse 12 crates . Artie , relax . She 'd probably just mistake ' em - for a bunch of junk and- - - Whoa , whoa , whoa ! It 's Lars . He 's dead . That never happens at Comic-Con . I 'm no doctor , but I 'm- - I 'm pretty sure the human head is not supposed to twist like that . His neck is broken . Well , given the unnatural angle , I would say his neck was forcibly snapped . He must have died instantly . You know , I think that ... Myka , what 's wrong ? What ? Nothing 's wrong ! Look , just judging by the dagger in his hand , I mean , he and Charlotte must have turned on one another , right ? There 's no blood on the dagger . He never got a chance to use it . [ Chuckles ] Okay , wait , I 'm sorry . All right , are we saying that Charlotte took out a guy over a foot taller than she is ? Well , look at his body position . He was obviously running up the stairs to get out . Maybe--what , maybe Charlotte found an artifact and used it on him ? All the more reason for us to snag and bag him before she uses an artifact on us . Who else could the intruder possibly be if not Nick ? I don 't know , can you wait until we get in there before you start pointing fingers ? Okay , when was the last time you saw him ? Oh , my God , Nick knows nothing about the Warehouse , okay ? Also , I 've got this place locked down tighter than Mrs. Frederic 's weave . Only person who gets past my security protocols is me . Okay , but if he could , what would he have to do first to break in , cut the power to Artie 's office or something ? Well , yeah . I mean , technically ... Yeah . But if the lights are on out here , chances are they 're still gonna be on in ... This proves nothing . There 's gotta be a glitch somewhere . Freaky . Everything looks normal . Let there be light . Can you tell if there 's anyone out there ? If there 's anything I can 't do , I 'll let you know . FYI , there 's not . [ Typing ] - Thermal imaging . - Yeah , okay , that blue spot is the Dark Vault , a breezy 66 degrees . All good there . That red zone , the Lehmann Fornax , - a balmy 120 . - There . Oh , the Bronze Sector ? Yeah , since everyone there is technically still alive , they radiate faint traces of heat . Right . Where are you going ? Well , to check the Bronze Sector . With all those heat signatures in flux , - it 's a perfect hiding spot . - I 'm going with you . No ! No , no , no . No , no . I need your eyes up here watching my back . Just give me a shout if you see anybody coming my way . Uh ... Seriously doubt it . But take this . This is nuts . Artie , you have to wait until we can clear the room ! Don 't worry . We 're fine . Nothing is gonna kill you , Myka . I know what you 're thinking . You do ? Yeah , Charlotte whacked Lars so she could keep all of Roaring Dan 's loot for herself . Yeah , you read my mind . Guys , come here . Look at this . [ Hinges squeak ] Ah . [ Chuckles ] Well , shiver me timbers . Look at this . It looks like Dan tried to replicate the interior of his ship , the Wanderer . Doesn 't look like Charlotte 's been here yet . [ Whimpers ] Well ... Let 's hope . Think Dan lived here ? Most historians say he died in 1949 , but the truth is he fell off the map decades earlier . Guys ! Check out Bonesy McDead over here ! Roaring Dan Seavey , I 'd imagine . Oh , it 's him all right . Take a look at this . During the raid on the ship Avalon , it 's said he lost a couple of fingers . And scored some serious bling in- - We 're here for artifacts , not treasure . Look around . You know what ? There 's no point in the three of us searching the same room . I 'm gonna check out the hall . [ Sighs ] [ Phone ringing ] Hey , I 'm running a diagnostic on the Warehouse systems and- - Claudia , check the thermal imaging . In Caretto-0101 . I think there 's somebody behind me--hurry . Checking right now . Oh , my God , Jinksy , watch your six . Oh , my God . Oh , my God , no . - Steve , what is it ? - Claudia , go . Get the hell out of the Warehouse , now ! What ? Why ? What 's ... You 're dead . She killed you ! [ Crash over phone ] Steve ! Jinksy ! Jinksy ! Aah ! Marcus . You remember me . That 's good . No . No . Uhh ! Children shouldn 't play with guns . [ Clank ] [ Both grunting ] [ Clatter ] - Uhh ! - Ohh ! How 'd you kill your bodyguard ? I didn 't . We were attacked ! - By whom ? - I don 't know ! But we 're not the only ones down here ! [ Panting ] If Roaring Dan actually tried to replicate the original cabin , these captains , they- - they often had escape hatches down to the cargo hold so that if their ship was under attack , they could go down there , grab their plunder , and get the hell out . So we look for a hidden passage . I love hidden passages ! This ... That could have a false bottom ... and hide a passageway . Whoo hoo hoo ! Man , my timbers are shivering ' .

Yeah , it just tried to kill me too . I know , right ? She 's- - Wait , what ? I 'll explain later . Just get here now . Hurry ! [ Whimpers ] Ah ! 20 miles of Warehouse , I find the one dead end . - Oh ... - [ Gasps ] Wrong turn . I killed you . You can 't be here . Yet here I am . What did you do with Steve ?

Look at the outside of the crates . They all have- - they all have , look . They have manifests . Just check those out . Maybe one of them will have a clue . I 'm not seeing anything that says " causes murderous smoke monster " on any of these labels . How about you , Myks ? Me , neither , but , look- - it 's gotta be here somewhere . So just keep looking . What the hell are you doing ? - I didn 't do anything ? - Uh , her . Oh ... nothing . Just checking my emails . This was never about Dan 's treasure . Was it , Charlotte ? This has always been about the artifacts . Artifacts ? What artifacts ? The artifacts that you knew somehow were down here - that you used us to find ! - What are you talking about ?

I don 't know , I think it 's maybe just a question of pitch . Of maybe it 's the composition of the brass . - I think we need the bell . - What the hell was that , Artie ? Smoke ? I don 't know . But from everything I 've seen , I think it 's some kind of psychic extension or projection . Projection of who ? Roaring Dan Seavey . When that smoke monster thing was choking Charlotte , I noticed that it only had three fingers on one hand , just like the skeleton upstairs . So even from the grave , Dan 's keeping an eye on his booty . Now all we need to do is find out what artifact he used . All right , let 's just keep looking at the manifest . And--carefully ! Because we don 't want to touch anything . I got Thaddeus Cahill 's telharmonium keyboard , which causes synesthesia . No . Uh , Robert the Bruce 's tartan inspires unyielding defiance . Guys ... this box is empty . What ? Uh , one jewel-studded unicursal hexagram amulet belonging to Aleister Crowley . Aleister Crowley ? The guy from the Ozzy song ? Yes . Yes , you 're right , actually . Aleister Crowley . He was a notorious occultist who spent much of his life studying and mastering the art or astral projection , which he considered essential in the quest for the discovery of one 's true will . So Dan 's one true will is protecting his treasure after his death . And--and he was a frustrated tenor who could never hit high " C " ! - What ? - The bell . That was a perfect high " C. " Oh , come on , tell me you could hear that . - What bell ? - All right , so--so--so- - Crowley 's amulet allowed our favorite pirate to project , but where is it ?

In our business , things almost never go as planned . - Wait . - Uhh ! Ohh ... So in Paris , Sutton ... the ... little weasel . He--he faked his own death too , didn 't he ? Well , it comes in handy when things get dodgy . It 's easier to- - to disappear when everybody thinks you 're dead . But you didn 't . You came back , and you saved us . Why ? I have dealt with agents since the Ottoman Empire hosted the Warehouse in 1561 . Alexi from Warehouse 11 killed me twice . But you three ... You--you were the first ones that risked your own life to save mine . It would seem that even the Warehouse has evolved . Wait , wait . Not--not so fast , Countess . You may have misjudged us , but the jury 's still out on you . What were you looking for in that Warehouse 12 crate ? The philosopher 's stone . From Harry Potter . From the Magnum Opus . It 's said that that stone can turn base metal into gold . Among other things . Sutton said that a stone kept him from aging . - Not just him . - Clearly . And now you 've got ... Do you mind ? Oh , just half the stone ? Where 's the other half ? I don 't know . But I need to find it . Uh-huh , and then what ? Unlimited power ? Power ? [ Laughing ] No . Then what do you want ?

Why is Nick at the BB ? We wanted something from you , something I wasn 't sure that you 'd give . Well ... [ Buzzing ] Yeah ? Artie , you guys need to get back here right now . Nick broke into the Warehouse and released one of the Bronze Sector prisoners , a guy names Paracelsus . The alchemist . Yeah , well , he was bronzed for a reason . Probably a good one .

 Julia : Chester 's mill is a place like any other . At least it used to be Until we were cut off from the rest of the world By a mysterious dome . ( cows bellowing ) Invisible , indestructible , Inescapable . We 're trapped . Julia : We don 't know where it came from or why it 's here , But now that we 're all trapped under the dome together , None of our secrets are safe . Dale barbara stands accused Of the attempted murder of julia shumway . And for the murders Of maxine and agatha seagrave . I am not turning our town into a police state Just because you say so . Big jim : It 's not me , linda , it 's the people . One drone caught surveillance of this rennie murdering The town reverend at the bridge roadblock . Big jim : That dome can 't come down . Not now . You 're a sick bastard . Everyone 's gonna smile when you die . Phil : Why 'd he do it ? Barbie won 't get away with it . Big jim : To the charges brought against you , how do you plead ? Not guilty . Norrie : It 's the pink stars . What does it mean ? Joe : The egg . We think it 's the source that powers the whole dome . Angie : Do you trust your dad ? Of course I do . You didn 't always . We all saw the same vision at the dome , junior . Big jim has to die . Norrie : When the butterfly hatches ... The monarch will be crowned . Hey , bud . We 've been waiting on you . It 's really happening . What 's happening ? Move away . Linda ... Back away ! How long have you guys known about this ? What about you ? Just a couple days , but , linda , Don 't do anything rash . The kids- - they , They think the egg is the source . Source of what ? The dome . It 's the generator of the dome . Norrie : We can sort of talk to it . It told us " the monarch will be crowned . " What is that supposed to mean ? Joe : We don 't know yet . But that 's a monarch butterfly . We think it 's got to be important , So we have to get it out of there before it hurts itself . Or worse . I know how it all sounds . But I believe them . Not guilty ? What , are you insane ? You think this is some sort of game ? ( grunts ) ( coughs ) You 're the one rolling the dice here 'cause julia 's still out there somewhere . And she knows the truth . I already told people the truth . You killed max , Her mother , and her bodyguard . Nobody can change that now . We 'll see . You entered your plea . Now you get your justice . ♪ Tell me ! Why do you want me to kill my father ? ( grunts ) Hey , take it easy , julia . I appreciate everything that you 've done , But I can 't hide out down here . You are not safe out in the open . I 'm the only one who can exonerate barbie . Which is exactly why big jim will have you killed Long before you can tell anyone . Then I 'll die trying . ( grunts ) Angie , please . You don 't have to come with me , But you can 't stand in my way . ( grunts ) You don 't know anything about this . I mean , it could be radioactive . The big dome isn 't . Well , this doesn 't belong to you . As of now , this is police property . What the hell ? Barbie : You didn 't think I was just gonna roll over , did you ? Make this easy for you ? No , nothing with you is easy . I know you 're just gonna screw me in the end . You don 't know any other way . But at least I can take you down with me . ( chuckles ) I don 't think you understand what 's happening here . I could end this right now with a bullet in your head . Oh , yeah . You can . But you won 't . You won 't Because there 's no audience here . The butterfly hits the dome . And makes some kind of spot . Oh , my god . Joe : We 've got to do something . Guys ? Is it just me or is it getting crazy dark outside ? Barbie : Listen , jim . This isn 't just about killing me . This is about making sure This entire town knows that you are judge , Jury and executioner . ( people clamoring outside ) What the hell ? What are you trying to tell me ? ! This is seriously weirding me out . It 's the middle of the day , But it looks like it 's midnight out there . There 's no moon . No stars . It 's dying , norrie . See ? The dome 's trying to talk to us . Maybe it 's some kind of warning . The dome 's telling us we have to get the butterfly Out of there before it dies . But we need the others . All right , I 've heard enough . All available units ? Don 't do this . All available units To ben drake 's house . Listen to them . Please . I found another dome . And some sort of ... Egg . We 're in trouble . Linda ? It-it 's the dome . It 's all black . I know , junior . Just get your ass over here . All right , I 'm impounding this ... Thing Until we see what happens . Linda , you found it ? Jim , you need to see this . 10-4 . I 'm on my way , too . ( siren blaring ) ( egg screeching ) Make it stop ! Norrie : We don 't know how . Yeah , we-we kind of do . Remember ? Oh , yeah . That time we touched it . No , I told you . This is police property now . If anybody 's gonna touch it , It 's gonna be me . We have to get to that egg . And we will . After we help barbie . No , it can 't wait , julia . If linda takes the mini-dome , And it ends up in the wrong hands ... Barbie needs my help . Our help . This might be our only shot To save his life . Are you with me ? She 'll be fine . Joe : It was the only way . So , now what ? What did you guys do ? Carolyn : She touched the dome . Joe : She got zapped . Like dodee . The monarch is dying , junior . We need angle . Screw angle . What ? She ran off with julia . Julia was under police protection . My protection . She did what she had to do . By helping barbie ? He shot julia . No , I saw him save her life . Things are happening , junior . Things bigger than us . It 's not always about you . Ben : Guys ! It 's big jim . Norrie : Mom , you have to get out of here . You , too , ben . This is on us . All three of us . Right , junior ? Or do you want your dad to lock that thing away Before it can give us any answers ? Let 's go . I guess everyone is out dealing with the blackout . Permanent darkness has its bright side . Okay , the cells are down there . I 'll get the keys . ( grunts ) ( footfalls approaching ) My god , how are you even standing ? I don 't know . But something out there really wanted me back on my feet . All right , that 's enough , lovebirds . It 's go time . ( door creaks ) Linda ! Linda ! Jim ... Linda ! Are you okay ? What happened ? Where is it ? ( moans ) ( exhales ) Linda ( grunts ) : I don 't know . But the egg ... ( moans ) They think it 's the generator . That it might be able to bring the whole dome down . Jim , we have to find it . This could be our best shot of getting out of here . ( exhales ) Norrie : Now all we have to do is get angle . We don 't even know where she is . I know how to find her . You do ? She has a police radio . She stole one . We could send her a message . For the entire force To hear ? What can we even say ? ( panting ) Oh , hell , no . ( grunts ) Don 't . ( panting ) No handcuff keys . Barbie : Forget about it , let 's get out of here . You lose something ? Hold onto those for me , will you ? Joe ( on radio ) : Angie . Angie mcalister ! Angie , if you can hear me , look ... We 're on the move ... With the mini-dome . Remember where we went to hide When we broke mom 's old mirror ? Meet us there . Junior : This is never gonna work . Trust me , angie would never forget about the time We hid in the cement factory . No , I mean that thing in there Is probably already dead . Joe ! Thank god . Junior : Don 't take another step . Angie : Junior , stop ! No ! This guy 's a psychopath ! James , I don 't know what your father told you , But barbie didn 't shoot me . A woman named maxine did . Maxine . My dad 's friend ? Barbie : Hey . Is that supposed to do that ? We have no idea Where joe and angie are meeting . There 's only so many places to hide . We 'll start with the mcalisters ' old barn . Phil ( on radio ) : Linda , you there ? I 'm sorry . Phil , are you all right ? Yeah , but barbie got away . What ? He 's with julia . She helped him escape . Phil , stay put . I 'm on my way . We ready ? On three . One ... Two ... Three . ( dome humming ) Whoa . It opened up . Angie : Oh , god . We 're too late . It 's dead . No ... Look ! ♪ Okay , is somebody gonna tell me what the hell 's going on here ? I knew it . You 're the monarch . ( crickets chirping ) Andrea ... Andrea , what-what-what ... What 's going on ? Everyone 's getting right with the lord Before the end times . Hey , listen , I know people are scared , But this is a , this is a crisis , Not the damn apocalypse . " and I beheld the sixth seal , The sun became black as sackcloth . " Andrea , listen ... Just like revelations said it would . Give us this day our daily bread , And forgive us our trespasses ... ( praying indistinctly ) ( whispering ) : Please , god . Forgive us our trespasses , As we forgive those who trespass against us . And lead us not Into temptation , but deliver us from evil . ( woman humming hymn ) Thank you , everybody , for coming . I know there 's been a bit of a hole in our spiritual community Sine the passing of reverend coggins , But I 'm here to tell you The good lord has not forgotten about chester 's mill . How can you say that ? But at least I could still grow my crops . ( affirmative murmuring ) Without sunlight , we all starve . If we don 't freeze to death first . What if the temperature starts dropping ? My family is already Out of propane . Listen , I give you my word : Nothing like that 's gonna happen . How do you know that ? ( murmuring loudly ) ( murmuring fades ) I don 't . ( congregation murmuring ) But I have faith . I have faith in us . I have faith in god . I have faith that he would never Ask more of us than we can handle . The good book says , " light is sown for the righteous . " Well , there 's been too much evil And too much lawlessness since that dome came down . Yep . Man : Yeah . Big jim : That 's about to change . And when it does ... You trust me . Chester 's mill will have its new dawn . No way . I refuse to believe he 's the monarch . But this has to be the way the dome picks a new leader . What , by using insects ? Norrie : Uh-oh . What now ? The egg . It 's doing something . Is it gonna hatch ? ( high-pitched noise ) Looks more like it 's gonna explode . ( bottle shatters ) What is this ? What do we do ? We get the hell away from that thing ! Barbie : He 's right , let 's go ! Wait . Barbie : No , julia , the whole place Is about to come down on us . Let 's go ! Angie : Julia , don 't touch it ! It 's dangerous ! ( high-pitched noise stops ) W ... Why did the shaking stop ? She 's your monarch . ( cupboard door slams ) Councilman rennie . Listen , I need you to put together a work detail . Find as many carpenters as you can . What is it ? It 's an idea that came to me at church . My great-grandfather built the last one That was in chester 's mill . Are you serious ? This town is on the brink of chaos , son . If we want to maintain the peace , We need to show everyone exactly how serious we are About law and order . Phil : All right . For dodee . Yes . For dodee . ( crickets chirping ) Jim , you there ? Yeah , go ahead , linda . I 'm at joe 's , but there 's nothing here . You 're sure ? Any clues to where they may have gone ? Looks like they were using this barn as some weird art project . Does " the pink stars are falling in lines " mean ? What did you say ? " the pink stars are falling in lines . " Why ? That mean something to you ? Not for a long time . Meet me at my house , linda . So , if julia 's in charge now , then ... What are we supposed to do next ? I ... ( sighs ) I don 't know . Exactly . She 's not the monarch . There 's no such thing . We have to take that egg to the real authorities . Angie : No . We are not taking anything to that monster . Don 't talk like that . Barbie : That 's the truth , junior . I watched your father shoot maxine in the head . She was bound and unarmed . He executed her . Junior : Bull . My dad ? Hurt a woman ? Angie : Probably one of the many reasons That the dome told us to assassinate big jim . No , I 'm-I 'm done listening to you all Run down my dad . He 's the only thing keeping this town together . James , calm ... Shut up ! All you do is lie ! Junior ... She told me in these same tunnels . The only reason julia 's even in chester 's mill is ' cause She got fired from her last job for lying . Just like she 's lying about my dad right now . Hand it over , julia . Run ! Angie , stop ! Angie ! Oh ! Go ! Barbie ! Go ! ( grunting ) Get up . Get up ! You 're done . You 're done ! Linda : Jim , can you just tell me what 's going on ? You wouldn 't believe me , That 's why I have to show you . Show me what ? My wife , pauline , before she passed , She was paranoid , unstable , Ranting about all kinds of crazy things . She kept saying one thing over and over , like a mantra : " the pink stars are falling . " Are you sure ? Maybe it 's a coincidence . ( twigs snapping ) Oh , thank god . Are you okay ? Yeah . How about the others ? Julia : Junior got barbie . What are we gonna do now ? Okay , something this powerful has got To be what 's generating the big dome . If we destroy the egg , maybe it 'll go away . Or maybe it 'll start another earthquake . Why don 't we just try asking it ? What do I say ? Whatever feels right . Please ... Just tell us what to do . Great . Can we try blowing it up now ? Holy ... Mom ? So , she knew all this was gonna happen . How is that possible ? I don 't know . But the whole time we kept thinking she was sick ... Maybe she was trying to warn us . I don 't know why I didn 't see it . Maybe I could have done more for her . Jim , you need to stay strong ... For us . I mean , if your wife saw the dome coming , That means your family 's important . It means you 're important . ( over radio ) : Linda , it 's junior . Where the hell have you been ? I 've got barbie in custody . I 'm bringing him in . Mom ... Sweetheart ... I don 't think that 's your mother . Forgive us , We 're still learning to speak with you . We 've taken on a familiar appearance To help bridge the divide . What divide ? What the hell are you ? Joe : I think , I think it 's whoever sent the dome to chester 's mill . Angie : Why ? Why are you punishing us ? The dome wasn 't sent to punish you . It was sent to protect you . Protect us from what ? You 'll see ... In time . How can we see anything Now that you 've blacked out the dome ? If you want the darkness to abate , You must earn the light . How ? By protecting the egg . And if we fail , It 's the end , isn 't it ? For all of us . So how do we protect it ? Who are we protecting it from ? ( gasping ) ( crying ) : Oh , no .

It 's the key to all this , isn 't it ? Making the darkness go away ? Controlling the dome ? You want to know a secret ? You may think that you 're some kind of god to these people . But I think we both know what you really are . What 's that , a ... Criminal ? Worse . A politician . ( door creaks open ) Okay , we 're clear . Go to the back room . Stay away from the windows .

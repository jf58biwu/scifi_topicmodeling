 13 Bannerman Road is where Sarah Jane Smith lives . And it 's home to things way beyond your imagination . There 's an extra-terrestrial super computer in the wall ... her son , a genetically engineered boy genius ... a schoolgirl-investigator across the road ... and a whole universe of adventure right here on the doorstep . Ready ? Always . I need your help . Whatever Androvax has done ... we can 't ignore them . That 's Ocean Waters . Mum 's friend ? She was kidnapped by aliens ? Take me , Androvax . Do it now . I haven 't taken it off in 40 years . Androvax , no ! Prepare to be incinerated ! SHE SCREAMS Mr Dread , no ! Give me the activator discs . Never ! He 's an alien , too ! We only want to save Androvax 's species . Why won 't you help us ? The equilibrium must be maintained . What does that mean ? The Veil ship must not be taken from the vault . And if it is ? The ship 's star-drive engines will disrupt the vault matrix . The dimensional disturbance will tear your planet apart . But my people will live again ! Androvax ! No ! Hello . Is Sarah interviewing Ocean ? I knew she 'd think there was a story there . It 's you ! Did the Alliance of Shades program you with any morals at all ? I am a remarkable machine , Miss Smith . And 100 % reliable . Wait till BURPSS hear about this ! Didn 't they say something about Earth being destroyed ? You 're right . Better call an extraordinary meeting . Clyde ! What ... What happened ? Don 't shoot ! That 's Clyde , not Androvax ! Rani , he took your mum ! And the discs ! Mum ! Oh , no . He swapped bodies . He thought it would slow us down . But we will save your planet . I 'm sorry , I should 've done something to stop Androvax . It 's not your fault , Clyde . It 's mine . I should 've kept Androvax in that containment vortex . But we need to find her ! We will ! Before they do ! We will ! Why did I ever trust Androvax ? You thought it was right . We were trying to help him . Some people you can 't help . Look , it 's Mr Dread . Oh , those old cars ... they can conk out just like that . Oooh , gotcha . HORNS BLAST What 's he doing ? He 's not going anywhere . Oi ! Mate ! Get a move on ! Come on ! Shift it ! You want to get a new motor , mate . Thank you . I 'll take this one . Goodbye . Quickly . Wait . Mr Dread 's friends are still here . Yeah but Androvax is after the vault , we don 't know where it is . This place is huge . We should split up to find Gita . Ah , we have to find her ! If you find your mum , don 't go near her . Even if she says it 's her , you can 't trust her , you call me . I know . I will . BEEPING It 's close now . Maybe I should 've told mum and dad . What do you mean ? Well , after they saw the Judoon with Androvax . We thought it was funny , pretending we didn 't know anything about aliens . It 's not much of a joke now , is it ? What if I 'd told them , Clyde ? Maybe none of this would have happened . And maybe it wouldn 't have made any difference . Look , I know Sarah Jane doesn 't believe in fate . But I reckon that time and the universe ... they 're not random . Everything 's sort of tied together by these invisible strings , like your mum joining BURPSS or Ocean Waters having that disc thing . You mean if something 's going to happen , it 's going to happen ? Yeah . Well , some things , anyway . But we 're going to save your mum now , so if it 's the universe against Clyde , the universe better bring some mates . DOOR OPENS Ugh . Ohh ! Mum ! He 'll kill her ! Quick ! CLATTER SHE HISSES Time to burn . Strike ! Mum ! Androvax ! Whatever ! This way now ! Impressive , don 't you agree ? Mr Dread . What happened , did you call out the AA ? Oh , no , no , in your case , that would be ... Androids ' Association . Yes ... I have a Neuron X Series five Cyber-processor , titranic endoskeleton and a power cell that will maintain electro-functions for 500 years . My purpose is to hide the existence of alien life from Earth and guard the vault . I am not programmed for comedy . And from what I can see the last time you were about I was in hot pants . Did the Alliance of Shades realize that you were doing such a bad job they pulled the plug ? Literally , in your case . The Alliance was disbanded . We became guardians of the vault . But now we have been reactivated , our other protocols remain intact . What does that mean ? You have alien technology . It must be confiscated . And you must be processed . Sorry . Hands off ! Ugh ! We should be OK in here for a bit . Are you going to be all right ? Of course not ! The swamp viper venom is killing me ! Then give me my mum ! Now ! I need her . To free my people . You can 't talk sense to him . I 'm calling Sarah Jane . Wait , Clyde . Please . Just trust me . Androvax , I know how you feel . I felt it earlier . Look , we all want to save the people we love . You don 't need my mum . You can take me . No ! Look , I need to save my mum . Your body for hers ? I 'm younger than she is . I 'm fitter . Take me . You have a deal . What ... what 's happening ? Clyde ? Rani ! Never mind your body ! I 'll have your blood ! It 's you ! Get her out of here ! Get her out , Clyde ! It 's a dream .. it 's just a bad dream Gita . Obviously got my jeans on ... this time ! Which way ? The way out sounds good to me . Wait , wait ! Oh ! Oh , my dreams are never normally as exciting as this . Except when George Clooney pops round for a cup of tea . Mum , this isn 't a dream . Aliens are real . Me , Clyde , Sarah Jane and Luke , we know all about them . We always have . You knew ? How ? Look , it 's a long story , but we haven 't got time now ! Androvax is after us and so are the Men in Black . If we don 't get a move on , the world 's going to end . What ? ! Run ! Which way ? We 're stuck ! I guess it 's up to me , then , to be the decoy . Be careful . Since when ? Oi ! Annie Android ! Stay back ! OK . Count of four ... One ! Four ! Hasta la vista . The venom is getting stronger . Every vein in my body is on fire . Where 's Gita ? What have you done with her ? The poison clouded my head . Her brat of a daughter tricked me . You shouldn 't have taken Gita ! I said I 'd help you ! That didn 't include using my friends ' bodies . And now what , Sarah Jane Smith ? Will you still help me ? When the re-birth of my civilisation means the end of yours ? You know I can 't do that . Oh , God ! Oh , don 't shoot her ! It 's not Androvax ! Yes , the Veil energy has gone . Are you an alien ? I 'm an android . And you are my prisoners . Is there anything I can do ? You heard what your Xylok said . Swamp vipers ... they don 't give you any second chances . No , it doesn 't seem like it . Oh , my people , if only you could have seen what they had done . We had such beauty , Sarah Jane Smith . Such ... humanity . I 'm sorry , Androvax . To lose a world like that . I can 't imagine what it must feel like . To have nothing and no-one left across the whole universe . But what you did was futile and wrong . I thought you saw that now , I thought you wanted redemption . But you were prepared to destroy Earth to bring your people back . You haven 't learned a thing . But now I will be among them ... again . ANDROVAX 'S VOICE : Hello again , old friend . What are you going to do with us ? I 've heard what aliens do to humans when they get their sticky paws on them . I read it in the Sunday papers . All that probing and implanting . As an android , I have no interest in either probing or implanting . But I do have an interest in the Veil . He is weak . He will soon need another body to sustain him . You mean us ? What , you 're going to use us as bait ? No way ! Your approval is not required . What if he gets to the vault first ? My associates will handle that . No , mate . Your associates have been Clyde-inated . Cool shades , though . Come on ! We 've got to find Sarah Jane . Soon , my brothers and sisters ... soon ... I will release you . And our people will live again among the stars . Sarah Jane ! Rani . You found your mum . We 've got a few things to talk about when this is all finished . Of course , but right now I have something important to take care of . What happened to Androvax ? The swamp viper venom took him . So why are we opening the vault ? If we can save just two of his people , the Veil species still has a chance . So there 's no need to start the star-drive ? Mr Smith can arrange for a passing ship to take them to a new planet . Clyde , use the activator disc . Spaceships ! Rani , it 's full of spaceships . Spaceships , my darling ! Spaceships ! Yes , Mum , we know . It 's amazing . Spaceships ! All I want to know is how did they get them all in there ? This door isn 't that big . The transmat device . Remember ? There isn 't much time ! Agh ! Sarah Jane ? Androvax ! No way ! Somebody tell me I didn 't see that ! If you start that ship 's engines the vault will be de-stabilised . The dimensional imbalance ... it will destroy Earth ! This was always my destiny ... to save my people . Their ship was always calling to me ! Even when I crashed on Earth with the Judoon ! Destruction and re-birth , Sarah Jane Smith . It is the way of the universe . No ! He took the disc ! We can 't get in ! Is that it , then ? We 're all going to die ? I realise this is new to you , Gita , but there 's one thing we never do in this situation . And that 's give up . But I really wish Luke was here now . Well , Luke isn 't here . All we 've got is Mr Dread . He 's this way ! Star drive activation commencing ! Oh , this is not good . He 's started the ship 's star drive Come on ! He 's in his box . Mr Dread ! We need your help ! It 's like he 's de-activated himself . Well , if he 's de-activated , maybe this will work . That hurt . I 'm sorry , but Androvax has started his ship 's star drive . I did warn you . Earth will be destroyed in two minutes . Two minutes ? ! Then you 've got to do something ! The laws of hyper-dimensional physics cannot be changed . The transmat equipment . Isn 't that how you put the ships in there ? Yes . Then you can use it to beam that Veil ship out of there , into space . Theoretically . But this equipment was all deactivated in 1972 . There is no power source . There is . You . Your power cell will keep you running for 500 years . Oh ! Haresh ... It 'll be all right , Mum . I promise . If you 've always been here to protect the Earth from alien stuff , now 's the time to get stuck in . None of this would be happening if it wasn 't for you . Clyde 's right . So you have to stop this . Now ! I want you to know . This is not in my job description . I don 't think we 've got much time . Scanning the vault . Setting coordinates . Powering transmatter equalizer . The system 's draining him . Transmat systems at 80 % ... 85 ... 90 ... Locking on . Transmat energizing . Thank you . I need a holiday . We did it ! We did it ! We saved the world ! Yeah ! No ... My energy levels are at critical . 450 years of power used in two minutes . Can you re-charge ? It 's unnecessary . Without the second activator disc , the vault can never be opened again . The hyper-dimensional link has been severed . My mission is terminated . Oh , Rani , wait till your father hears about this ! Oh , wait till Ocean hears about this . Oh , my darlings ... we 'll be on the news ! All over the world ! That 's not the way it works . Don 't be silly . We just saved the Earth ! I 'll be on Newsnight ! Haresh is going to be so jealous ... I do have a thing for Jeremy Paxman . I can see the headlines now ! " Lizard Spaceman Used Me Like An Overcoat ... By Gita Chandra ! " This is not good . I know . Mr Dread , could I ask you for one last teensy-weensy favour before you retire ? You should all look away . Gita Chandra ? Yes , my darling ? Oh , that was such a good laugh ! Glad you 're feeling yourself again . Oh , I can 't remember the last time I went on a picnic . Let 's do it all again next week ! Yeah . Great . Dad will be so jealous he missed out all the fun . Oh , it 's Mulder and Scully again . Don 't I know you two from somewhere ? Of course you do . It 's Ocean and Minty from BURPSS . Oh , pardon you ! British UFO Research and Paranormal Studies Society . Ealing branch . I 'm sorry . I don 't believe in aliens . But if you ask me , my mum 's out of this world . Ah , thank you , my darling . Now I wonder what your dad made for tea ? I 'm starving . You just had a picnic . Remember ? I know . How weird is that ? But you were there . The Men in Black . You saw them . They got you , didn 't they ? Men in Black ? Oh , come on , Minty . It 's the same old story . The aliens always win . So Mr Dread went back in his box and that 's the last of the Men in Black ? His energy cell was completely depleted . What about Androvax ? Do you think he made it ? Will he save his race ? Despite everything , I hope so . No , I really do . Somewhere there is a new planet for the Veil . A new hope , it is the legacy of Androvax , a new beginning a second genesis . The Doctor ... is dead . UNIT will take charge of the funeral in conjunction with the Shansheeth . It 's Jo Grant . It 's a long time since I 've been called that . Getting closer . No , no , no , no , no ! Closer and closer . It 's Shansheeth ! This whole thing 's a trap ! Space ... is ... taken ! Gosh . That was different . Hello , everyone ! Doctor !

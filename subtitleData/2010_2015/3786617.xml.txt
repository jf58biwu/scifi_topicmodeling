 Through this holy anointing , may the lord and his love and mercy help you with the grace of the holy spirit . May the lord who frees you from sin save you and in his goodness raise you up . Are you ready ? Time of death , 5 : 21 a.m. We have a team assembled and waiting . Ms. Donovan , I 'm afraid we need to begin the procedures right away . I love you . We gotta hurry up . Core temp 's dropped . Where 's the list ? Yep . - Watch your back , sir . - Get her to harvest . We 'll be able to coordinate that with the transplant team . Great . Do we have a time frame ? Not yet . Lean it over . I 'm gonna begin with the kidneys . The heart and lung block are gonna come last . Clamping off the renal artery now . Yes , doctor . All right , I 've got the first one . Oh , God , she 's alive ! Get a trauma team in here . The girl 's name is Lisa Donovan . She 's a high school junior . She collapsed during gym class last week and slipped into a coma . Doctors diagnosed a cerebral aneurysm . After she was determined brain-dead , her mother made the decision to take her off life support . And then she woke up from the dead screaming random numbers . This is Lieutenant Commander Turlough , United States Navy . He 's here because it turns out those numbers weren 't random . They 're an alphanumeric code . The lead surgeon did two tours on an aircraft carrier . He recognized one section as lineal identification for sailors in the US Navy . That 's when I got the call . The first half of the sequence is ID information for a petty officer named Andrew Rusk . Second half of the sequence are launch codes for icbm missiles aboard a nuclear submarine he was stationed on , the USS Gloucester . How did classified launch codes get into the hands of a 17-year-old girl ? Exactly . That 's what I want to ask Rusk . If he 's revealing these codes , he 's committing high treason . When I tried contacting him , his wife told me she reported him missing . That was three days ago . Just to ask the obvious , you 've considered the possibility there 's some sort of connection between Rusk and the girl ? None that we 're aware of . As far as we can tell , there 's never been any contact between Lisa Donovan and Andrew Rusk . Well , I suppose that 's where we come in . So how is she ? Scared , as you can imagine . I 'm sorry . I 've never seen him before . The numbers that you repeated , do you know what they are , or do you remember hearing them before ? I don 't even remember saying them . I 'm sorry . Well , at least they got you some nice balloons . I guess they couldn 't find ones that said , " welcome back from the dead . " Yeah . I imagine those would be more of a special-order kind of thing , don 't you think ? Lisa , I just have a couple more questions . The man 's name is Andrew Rusk . Does that ring any bells ? Maya zvezdochka . - Shto samnoy ? - Lisa ? Pochimu ya ne magu govorit ? - What 's happening ? - She 's speaking Russian . But she doesn 't speak Russian . Maya Zvezdochka . Lisa ? Lisa , honey , are you okay ? Mom . - What 's happening to me ? - I don 't know . But you 're fine now . No more questions , please . - She should rest . - Of course . Rusk is fluent in Russian . He would have learned it during his training . Any idea what little star is ? Um ... Maya Zvezdochka means little star in Russian . I dated a Russian girl for a while . Most of what I picked up was curse words , but ... Hey . Where 's Walter ? Walter ! Shh . I 'm trying to listen . Listening to what ? These people are in comas . They can 't talk to you . Don 't judge him . He 's my son . And despite his narrow-mindedness , I 'm quite proud . Do you honestly think you 're communicating with her ? Why shouldn 't I be ? No one truly understands the nature of human consciousness , Peter . I 've read documented cases of coma patients waking up and claiming that they had moved , spirit-like , to remote locations and witnessed events they couldn 't possibly have knowledge of . In fact , I wouldn 't be surprised if that 's what 's happened to the young lady we just saw . Yeah , so ... You 're saying that you think , while Lisa Donovan died for a moment , her ... what , her spirit somehow left her body and floated over Andrew Rusk while he was in the process of telling somebody else those secret launch codes . Well , " floated over " is a tad specific , but ... something like that , yes . It 's a theory . It certainly is . Hi . Agent Dunham , I apologize if I was rude earlier . How is she ? They don 't have any answers , and now she 's running a fever . They want to run more tests . We got into a fight the morning she collapsed . I wouldn 't let her take the car . All she has is a learner 's permit . And then I got the call from school . But by the time I got to the hospital , she was in a coma . You know , I never thought that I would ... Get a chance to tell her how much I loved her again . God gave her back to me . You ... your daughter 's been through a lot . And ... so have you . I want permission to have Dr. Bishop examine her . What for ? I think he can help her . I think it might help find Andrew Rusk . There 's nothing more that she can tell you . Maya Zvezdochka . He was here . That man . He was here . Andrew Rusk , the man in the picture . He was here . I saw him . We searched the hospital for Rusk , got nothing . And Maureen Donovan won 't let us near her daughter . She said that our disruptive presence is what caused Lisa to hallucinate seeing Rusk 's image in the mirror . How she explain her kid speaking Russian ? Or knowing icbm launch codes ? Oh , Agent Dunham . Yes . I was asked to come in . I 'm Teresa Rusk . Mrs. Rusk , do you know this girl ? I don 't think so . No . Why , who is she ? Her name 's Lisa Donovan . She 's from brighton . You think she had something to do with my husband 's disappearance ? We 're not sure . But she has some information that only your husband should know . Information ? Classified military codes . Uh , Mrs. Rusk ... Teresa . Teresa , do the words Maya Zvezda mean anything to you ? Where did you hear that ? From Lisa Donovan . Do you know what it means ? " My star . " It 's a pet name Andy calls me . I don 't understand . Who is this girl ? How could she know that ? How ? Lisa Donovan 's aneurysm occurred in her left frontal lobe . Specifically her broca 's area . That 's the part of the brain that processes language . Precisely . But it also has the capacity for something far more intriguing . Hello , I 'm Dr. Walter bishop . This is test subject number six . What happened to subjects one through five ? I believe the university settled with them out of court . They probably never had to work again . Not that they could . I was asked to design an experiment to test whether cranial manipulation could increase a person 's psychic capability . I applied electrical stimuli to various parts of the brain and measured each psychic response . The point is that my tests proved that manipulation of broca 's area had the most dramatic effect on a person 's ability to create psychic bonds . So you think Lisa Donovan 's aneurysm made her psychic . It 's certainly a possibility . All right , well , let 's say that you 're correct . Why would she be channeling Rusk ? What 's so special about him ? That 's a good question . Walter , can you prove any of what you 're saying ? About her being psychic ? Perhaps , if I could examine the girl , but you say her mother has refused that . After watching Walter 's scariest home videos , who can blame her ? Hi . How are you feeling ? I 've been really tired , but good , I guess . What are you doing here , Agent Dunham ? We think we might have found an explanation for what happened to Lisa in the hospital . Really ? We believe that Andrew Rusk may be trying to communicate through you , psychically . We 're not sure how or why , but it seems that there 's a connection that 's been developed between him and your daughter . Lisa , give agent Dunham and me a minute alone , please . Lisa , I want to introduce you to somebody . Are you a religious woman , agent Dunham ? No . I 'm not . Then I imagine you sit in judgment of those of us who rely on our faith to guide our decisions about what 's best for our loved ones . No . I know what faith can mean to a person . But I also believe that what 's happening to Lisa is real , and if Rusk is a national security risk ... whatever happened , agent Dunham , it 's over now . And I believe what 's best for Lisa is that she put all of this behind her . Here 's my card . If anything else comes up . Yeah . The tibetan book of the dead ? Yeah , Walter 's been reading up on psychic connections . In the Tibetan teachings , the near-death experiencer can often converse with those who have already died . What do you think ? Well ... I think it makes a hell of a coaster . What do I think about what happened to Lisa ? I don 't think she 's alive because God changed his mind . I 'm just waiting to see if lightning strikes you . Yeah . I ... yeah . I mean , who am I to say ? Maybe there is actually something to it . People are free to believe whatever they want , right ? Lisa 's mother certainly does . However , until I see it with my own eyes , I 'm gonna put my money on healthy skepticism . You 're obviously a believer . My mother believed in God , but all the praying in the world didn 't stop my stepfather from terrorizing her . And her faith just seemed to put her in harm 's way . I 'm worried that Lisa 's mother is going to do the same thing . Dunham . Hello ? Agent Dunham ? It 's Lisa Donovan . Lisa . Are you okay ? It hasn 't stopped . I 'm seeing him again , Andrew Rusk . Where 's your mother ? She 's at home , but I 'm not . I had to come here . I keep seeing this place . Okay , where are you ? Lisa ? Lisa , where are you ? Olivia . Hey , you all right ? He ... he was here . Who was here ? I can see him . Andrew Rusk . There 's someone else . Another man . He has a gun . - Lisa ? - He shot him . He killed him . He killed Andrew Rusk . Lisa , do you know the other man ? Did you ... did you see his face ? No . But you 're sure that ... that they were here . Yes . Olivia . Found a .9 millimeter shell casing . Here you go . Not the most stylish , I know , but it will keep you warm . So I just talked to your mother , and she is on her way here . - Is she mad ? - No . She 's just glad that you 're okay . Hey , Liv . What is it ? Why don 't we just stay here for a second ? Come get in the car . You can get warm . It 's Andrew Rusk . Your girl was right . Olivia , I need some help ! What happened ? I don 't know . She just started to seize . I just talked to the medical examiner . He confirmed that Rusk was killed by a bullet wound to the head . Ruled out suicide . So everything Lisa told us pans out . Except one thing . According to the rigor of the body , Rusk has been dead for three days . Well , then , how would he have been communicating with Lisa Donovan ? Was the medical examiner more specific ? About the time of death , I mean . Between 5 : 00 and 7 : 00 a.m. Why ? Interesting . How is she ? Your daughter suffered a fairly substantial seizure . Oh , my God . But she 's responsive now , and her condition is stable . She 's lucky . I don 't think there 's gonna be any permanent damage . Is this because of her aneurysm ? No , there 's no connection between the two . I don 't understand . You said she was fine , but she keeps getting sicker . What 's causing this ? We 'll run some tests , but , with seizures , the cause is often unknowable . You mean ... this could happen again ? We just don 't know . But you should be able to see Lisa soon . Excuse me . What time did your daughter 's resurrection - take place ? - Her resurrection ? Just after 5 : 00 in the morning . Exactly as I suspected . Walter . What are you thinking ? I propose that Rusk 's murder and Lisa 's rebirth happened simultaneously . In fact , it was his suddenly dispatched energy which jumpstarted the girl 's body - and brought her back to life . - That 's absurd . Perhaps it is . Mm . Please allow me a moment to entertain my fantasies . They often lead to a truth . It 's possible that Rusk 's energy brought some of his memories with it . And it is these memories trapped within her , fighting to get out . Are you suggesting that Lisa is ... possessed ? I wasn 't . But now that you mention it , I wouldn 't be surprised if numerous possessions were in fact misdiagnosed cases of a phenomenon we are just now discovering . - I hardly think that 's what 's happened here . - Oh , you hardly would - because the church doesn 't approve of exorcism anymore . - Walter . No , because they are merely superstition ... because there are examples of casting out spirits right through the Bible , father . Can you help her ? Maureen , what are you doing ? I have been praying , hoping that Lisa will get better . But she 's not . If what you 're saying is true , and this man 's memories are making Lisa sick , can you ... can you get these memories out ? Can you help my daughter ? I will need to have your daughter transferred - to my lab . - Okay . Are you sure an exorcism is gonna work , Walter ? No , not at all . Unfortunately , I think I 'm wrong . I can 't explain the seizures . I believe that Rusk 's energy would reanimate the girl and carry his memories , but ... It doesn 't suggest why she 's sick . I was just so angry the way that man challenged me . Walter , her mother is about to check her out of the hospital . I have no idea what I 'm going to do with her . We got to go in there and tell her . Olivia . What are you thinking ? If Rusk is sick , could that make Lisa sick too ? What , like ... his illnesses would be transferred along with his spirit ? You want to know what I think , - or what Walter would think ? - Either . Well , you read Rusk 's file . Is there anything in there to suggest that he was sick ? No . But that was the navy 's official medical records . Well , you know me . If you tell me the US Government is covering something up , I 'll tell you it must be Tuesday . Commander Turlough , thank you for coming back to talk to me . Not a problem . Um , I was already here when agent broyles told me you found Andy Rusk 's body . Listen , why didn 't you tell me he was sick ? I ... I 'm sorry . Who told you that ? You did . Just then . What was wrong with him ? Was it something that happened onboard the Gloucester ? A young girl 's life is on the line . They were shadowing a Russian naval exercise in North Korean waters six months ago when a coolant line broke , causing a reactor leak . Rusk was locked in the engineering section for 16 hours before they were able to vent the contamination . Radiation . How could he possibly have survived ? He was airlifted to pearl harbor , where he was given a highly experimental radiation inhibitor . He 's been on medical leave since the accident . I 'm gonna need his medical records . The real ones . We can 't keep stalling , Dr. Bishop . You can 't think of anything to do ? Maybe I could tell them that my stomach is troubling me . That is not what I mean . Walter , I have Rusk 's medical file here . Does any of that mean anything to you ? " Radiation poisoning . " That 's why she had the seizure . The radiation and the synthetic treatments they gave him . I 'd wager that 's what kept his energy from dispersing . And you think that 's how he was able to inhabit Lisa . Which means we need more drugs . Uh , uh , to calm Lisa 's conscious mind . To relax her brain . Which should enable Mr. Rusk 's mental energy ... his memories ... to slowly and painlessly leave her mind . What kind of drugs ? Benzodiazepine . It 's a hypnotic sedative . May cause a slight tingling sensation . It 's actually quite pleasant . Besides , your daughter is 17 . I 'm sure she 's sampled far worse by now . Agent Farnsworth , prepare an IV drip , uh , 100 Mikes to begin per liter . This is just gonna make you a little sleepy . So are you , like , a doctor ? No . But I promise you this won 't hurt . It 's okay . It 's kind of nice to have someone not afraid of me . What do you mean ? Well , my friends at church . When I walked past them , I could feel them all talking about me behind my back . Kids at school are even worse . Ever since what 's happened , they think I 'm , like , a freak or something . Well , I don 't think you have to worry about us here . We 're kind of partial to freaks in this lab . How 's it going ? It 's smashing . Gene agrees with me , don 't you , gene ? So is agent Dunham , like , your girlfriend ? No . No . She 's like a friend who 's a girl . And who carries a gun . Walter , Astrid told me that you think you may be able to extract Rusk 's thoughts from Lisa 's brain . I believe so . Yes . Okay , well , if that 's the case , do you think that she would have access to his memories ? Maybe describe his last moments . Oh , you ... you want to find out who killed him . Yeah . Well . Well , let 's see , shall we ? - Peter . - Yeah . Strap Lisa down , please . Are straps really necessary ? It 's just a precaution . Just tell me if they 're too tight , all right ? Okay . How are you feeling , Lisa ? My toes are beginning to tingle and ... Oh , that 's good . That means it 's working . Dr. Bishop , we 're at 6 hertz . Peter . Yeah . Increase the drip 2 mikes , please . Done . I don 't think I like how this feels . Lisa , it 's okay . No . No , I think I want this to stop . Maybe we should slow this down . You know what , Lisa , this is actually normal . It 's okay . Just relax . I 'm gonna be right here . You 're safe . Lisa , just ... just close your eyes . Uh , mm . Close your eyes . This is going to help you . Now breathe . Breathe deeply . Just let it go , Lisa . Let it go . Lisa . It 's Agent Dunham . Can you hear me ? Hi . I want you to think about Andrew Rusk . Oh , oh , look , look , look . This is surprising . Surprising good or surprising bad ? Lisa ! She 's seizing ! No , she 's not . Lisa . You 've gotta stop this right now . I 'm afraid we have to let it run its course . Where am i ? Lisa . It 's mom . I 'm right here . Who ... is ... Lisa ? Why is she talking this way ? Because I believe this is not your daughter speaking any more . - What 's wrong with my daughter ? - Appears that my hypothesis ... Lisa 's mind was harboring Mr. Rusk 's memories ... was wrong . It would seem more likely that Mr. Rusk 's entire consciousness was transferred to Lisa . His consciousness . Perhaps his soul . Well , then where is Lisa ? Merely suppressed . Asleep in her own mind . I want this stopped . I 'm afraid I can 't do that . What do you mean you can 't ? We can 't stop the experiment . The drugs have taken effect . We must let the experiment complete the system . Listen , let 's go out and get some air , Miss Donovan . I can 't leave her . Miss Donovan , you have asked me to help . Please let me do my work . I can 't lose her again . I understand . She 's going to be fine . Can I talk to him ? To Rusk ? I hope so . Maybe the only way to coax him out . My name is Olivia . Do you know your name ? I believe that somebody hurt you and I want to find out who that was . Let me go ! Andrew . Andrew . Who killed you ? Who did this to you ? I called my wife . Told her I was getting a beer . There was someone in my car . In the back seat . Told me " pull over here . " " Get out . " " Walk . " " I said walk ! " " Get on your knees ! " I 'm not going out like that . Let me go ! Andrew . Andrew ! Who killed you ? Give me a name . Don 't know his name . Just ... His blood . His left arm . Walter . Walter . Peter , turn off the drip . Okay , I 'm gonna call the local hospitals and see if anybody 's gone in with an injured left arm . Peter . Hey . She 's coming out of it ! Hi . Hi . Did it work ? - Is he gone ? - Yeah . It 's her . Let 's get you out of this . Dunham . We got a hit . Jake Selleg , age 36 , walked into a Roxbury ER three nights ago . Lacerations on his left arm . You know , Liv , Jake Selleg was navy too , okay ? Now , he trained with seal team six . That 's counter terrorism . That can 't be a coincidence . Is he local ? He works at a boxing gym in Dorchester . Okay . Can you send me the address ? Sending it now . I 'll meet you there . On my way . That 's it . Nice . Nice cross . 'Scuse me . FBI . I 'm Agent Dunham . This is Agent Francis . We 're looking for a Jake Selleg . Hey ! Stop ! Lisa . Hey . Lisa , there 's no need for you to be looking at that . This is him . Rusk . Yeah . Astrid 's on her way back right now with your mom . Hopefully , you 'll be able to put all this behind you in life and get back to normal soon . Can I have something to drink , please ? Of course . Guessing you want something other than fresh cow 's milk . Okay . I 'll be right back . Hey , Walter . You drink all the cream sodas again ? What 's wrong ? Lisa 's brain scan . I think she 's still sleeping . Maybe you should take a look out in the lab . Well , her brain waves ... it appears that her signal is still being masked by Rusk 's dominant pattern . Rusk is still in control . Lisa . Where is she ? Where 's my daughter ? This is a slug we pulled from Andrew Rusk 's head . Our ballistic unit 's matching it as we speak from the .9 millimeter we found in your apartment . I guess the navy did a poor job training you to clean up after your work . Hey . Who ordered you to kill Andrew Rusk ? Was he threatening to go public over the meltdown on the gloucester ? Did the navy have you kill Andrew Rusk ? I don 't know what you guys are talking about . I spent seven years in the navy and I never killed a man . But Andrew Rusk deserved it . I 'm proud I killed that dirt bag . What do you mean he " deserved it " ? For what that bastard did to his wife . Rusk 's wife . What does this have to do with her ? I hang out at a bar she tends at . She told me about Andy . How he beats on her . One day she came in with a broken arm . She couldn 't deal with it any more . No one should have to live like that . Teresa Rusk hired you to kill her husband ? In the scrapyard , he kept asking me " why me ? " So I gave him the answer . I pulled the trigger , but I made sure that i told him that it was Teresa who was sending him to hell . You said that to Rusk ? Before you killed him , you told him his wife hired you ? Yes , ma 'am . Okay . Why didn 't Rusk tell us that ? He told us everything else . Why not that ? Dunham . Olivia , Rusk is still controlling Lisa and she 's gone . I think I know where he 's going . Rusk 's wife had him killed . I think he 's going for revenge . What the hell are you doing in my house ? Maya Svyozdichka . What did you say to me ? How ... how did you know to call me that ? You 're ... you 're that girl . You ... you get out of here . I ... I have a gun . Upstairs . In a safe . This gun ... That I got you from the service . How do you ... I ... I don 't understand . Well , neither do I. But I 've been given a second chance . And I 'm sure as hell not going to waste it . Now get down on your knees . Okay . Okay . Don 't do this . Please ! You had me killed . Put down like a dog . I want to hear you say it . I didn 't have you killed . I don 't know what you 're talking about ! That 's the thing about being with someone for 20 years , you know when they lie , how they lie . Admit what you did . Don 't . - Dunham . - It 's me . Where are you ? We 're five minutes out . Where are you ? I 'm just pulling up . Please don 't do this . Please ! Admit that you had me killed . Don 't you want to die with a clean conscience ? Please ! Don 't ! Stop ! Don 't do this . I 'll give you one chance to back out of here or we 're all going out together . You know I can 't do that . Then you 're making a mistake . You don 't have to do this . I already told you to leave once . I am not gonna tell you again . You know , I understand . What you said back at the lab . When I was in school , Lisa , I was different too . I was always sick . I didn 't have any real friends . What the hell are you talking about ? I 'm telling you that I understand , Lisa . You got to stop calling me Lisa . I know what it feels like to feel different all the time . I 'm gonna count to one . Lisa , listen to me . You 've been given a second chance here , but you have to fight for it . One ! Peter . Yeah ? What happened ? Well , I 'll tell you all about it , but not right now , okay ? Right now you need to rest . So they 're gonna take you to the hospital , and get you checked out , and make sure that everything 's okay . And then they 'll bring you back to the lab . And we 'll meet you there . Okay . Okay . How 'd you know it would work , that you could reach her ? Walter 's book of Tibetan philosophy . " Innermost subtle consciousness is ever present . It never leaves the body even in death . " You got a lot of mileage out of a coaster . Yeah . In other words , I threw up a hail mary . Perfectly normal . Singular consciousness . Lisa 's . Which means he 's gone . I believe so . I would propose that Mr. Rusk stuck around to deal with unfinished business . And once he did , then , well , Lisa was free to finally purge herself of him . How can we be sure ? NisI credideritis , non intelligentis . I don 't understand . It 's a Latin translation of Isaiah 7 : 9 . " Unless you believe , you will not understand . " Even as a scientist , sometimes I have to rely on faith . God keep you and yours safe , Dr. Bishop . And you , ma 'am . Come along , Lisa . Time to go home . - You all set , sweetheart ? - Yeah . Oh . Okay . Take care . Thank you again , Agent Dunham . It 's Olivia . And you 're welcome . Thank you . Bye . I 'll be 18 in a year . Don 't wait to long to make your move . Well , the navy officially denied our request to launch an investigation into the USS Gloucester . Well , there 's a shocking surprise . Thinking about his shipmates , I shouldn 't worry . I suggest that Mr. Rusk 's postmortem adventures will prove to be the exception rather than the rule . And if not , then we 'll go into the exorcism business . Is it just me or did you detect a note of excitement in his voice ? 'Cause I for one cannot wait to get that guy out of here . He just jumped the curve . I 'm not getting a pulse on this guy . Maya Svyozdichka . What 'd he say ? I think he 's speaking Russian .

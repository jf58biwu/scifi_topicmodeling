 I was born in space . I 've never felt the sun on my face or breathed real air or floated in the water . None of us have . For 3 generations , The Ark has kept what 's left of the human race alive , but now our home is dying , and we are the last hope of mankind , 100 prisoners sent on a desperate mission to the ground . Each of us was sent here because we broke the law . On the ground , there is no law . All we have to do is survive , but we will be tested by the earth , by the secrets it hides , and , most of all , by each other . Previously on " The 100 " ... Who shot me ? Bellamy Blake . He stowed away on the dropship . We 're still investigating who helped him . Kill the chancellor . That 's why you took the wristbands , you needed everyone to think we 're dead . The Ark finds out we 're alive , they 'll come down , and when they do , I 'm dead . Earth is survival . Mankind if going home . Hey , why were you defending him ? Because he saved my life . I never wanted any of this to happen to you . Thank you . Did you talk to The Ark ? I told Digg 's mom the news , John 's dad . I 'm supposed to talk to Roma 's parents later . Thanks for doing that . I owe you . Telling all these parents that their kids were murdered by grounders , I just wish I could say we were getting some justice . We 're not killing him . You were a lot scarier when you had that face paint on . Tell me about the grounder . Can he provide any insight on how to survive winter ? We 're doing everything we can to prepare here . We 're gathering nuts and berries , curing meats , digging for roots , but the truth is , we 'll freeze before we starve . There 's good news on that front . According to civil defense plans from before the war , there 's an old emergency aid depot not far from the landing site . Here are the coordinates . In addition to supplies , it could provide shelter for the 100 and for the citizens coming down from The Ark . And what makes you think it 's intact ? It was designed to withstand nuclear warfare . All right . It 's worth a shot . Chancellor , I have to object . Project Exodus is under way . The kids should sit tight in their camp until the first dropship launches . Even if everything goes without a hitch , the 100 would die from exposure before relief arrives . I 'd like a moment with Clarke alone , please , and I know there 's a line of parents waiting to talk to their kids . Clarke , we all are very proud of what you 've done down there . Your mother ... I don 't want to talk about my mother . Please , Clarke . It 's time to forgive . Let me schedule a time for you and Abby to sit down ... Look . I know you both think that betraying my dad , killing him , was an unavoidable tragedy , but I don 't see it that way , and I never will . So just tell me who 's next and let someone who actually wants to talk to their parents have a turn . Dax . Hey , you guys seen Dax ? Over there on the meat crew . Dax ... you 're up . Where 's my mom ? You can see her after you and I have a little talk . Are you alone ? Yeah . Why ? If I remember right , you beat a man to death . - He stole from me . - Relax . I have a problem , and I think you can help me fix it , and in return , I can guarantee your mom a spot on the first dropship and for you a choice assignment when I get to the ground . What do you want me to do ? Kill Bellamy Blake . You 're still here ? I 'm not moving until you let me up there to see him . Get comfortable . I let him live . Isn 't that enough ? He saved my life and yours . I know you see it that way , but ... That 's the way it is . He 's still dangerous . Only because of what you did . Whatever twisted connection you think you have with that animal , forget it . You don 't get to see him . End of conversation . Why do you even care if I ruined your life ? You should want me to go up there . Maybe you 'll get lucky and he 'll kill me , problem solved . Octavia , you know I didn 't mean that . Bellamy ... The answer is still no . I 'm not talking to Jaha . Hey , relax . That 's not why I 'm here . What , then ? The Ark found some old records that show a supply depot not too far from here . What kind of supplies ? The kind that might give us a chance to live through winter . I 'm gonna go check it out . I could use backup . Why are you asking me ? Well , because right now , I don 't feel like being around anyone I actually like . I 'll get my stuff , meet you in 10 . What do you think they 're gonna do with the grounder ? I 'd rather not think about it . Well , it 's been days since Bellamy captured him . How long till his friends come looking ? Cheer up . In that time , we 'll all be dead from hypothermia . Hey , hey , hey . How are you feeling ? Weak , bored ... Grateful to be alive . Well , if you want to stay that way , you should rest . I 'll tie him down if I have to . I 'm gonna be out of camp today . Can you change his bandages in a few hours ? Wait . Where are you going ? It 's a little assignment from The Ark . It 's nothing to worry about . It 's not safe out there . Finn , Clarke is a big girl . She can take care of herself . Clarke ... Let 's get a move on . Make sure he stays in bed . It sounds like a plan . That 's a lot of rations . You realize this is a day trip . A lot can happen in a day . Hey , Miller , Roma 's parents are waiting for you on the radio . Hi . We don 't have a lot of time . I brought you some water . Here . It 's good , right ? Sorry I haven 't see you since everything happened . My brother has been keeping me away . He 's a total dick , which you probably already figured out . You do understand me . I knew it . Well , at least let me get you cleaned up quick . This is all my fault because I freaked out so bad when you locked me up in that cave . You 'd totally understand why if you knew how I grew up . My name is Lincoln . Lincoln . I 'm Octavia . Well , is that it ? Is that all you 're gonna say ? It 's not safe for us to talk . Well , if we shouldn 't talk , then why did you tell me your name ? I want you to remember me after I 'm dead . You 're not gonna die . Don 't say that . Octavia ... This only ends one way . Just talk to them . Tell them you 're not the enemy . I am . Octavia , get the hell out now . Bellamy is not even here . Get out , or he gets the beating I 've been aching to give him . Ok , ok . I get it . I 'm gone . You know the first dropship is gonna come down soon . Pretty sure you can 't avoid Jaha forever . I can try . The depot is supposed to be around here somewhere . There 's got to be a door . Maybe he 'll be lenient . Look . I shot the man , Clarke . He 's not just gonna forgive and forget . Let 's just split up , cover more ground . Stay within shouting distance . I 'd hate to see the other guy . You did , when you were torturing him . Finn was dying . I 'm not gonna apologize for doing what I had to do . It must suck to come all the way down here to find out your boyfriend is into somebody else . I 'm not doing this with you . Hey . Hey . Thirsty ? Let me get that . Wait . Wait . I 've been waiting since they locked you up on The Ark . We can 't , not till we talk . I don 't want to talk . Something happened . Finn , I know , and I don 't want to talk about it ... - Well ... - Ever . Do you love me ? Always . Ok , then . You 're supposed to be resting . Let me . Bellamy . Over here . I found a door . I think it 's rusted shut . Here . Watch your foot . Ok . Give me a hand . Here . Really think this place hasn 't been touched since the war ? A girl can dream . Come on . Hell of a place to die . So much for living down here . This place is disgusting . Damn it . Anything left down here is ruined . They must have distributed most of the supplies before the last bombs went off . Hey , I found blankets . Excited about a couple of blankets ? Well , it 's something . How about a canteen or a med kit or a decent fricking tent ? Oh , my God . What ? Earth is scary . It 's amazing ... fresh air , trees ... nuts . These taste better than usual , right ? Oh , I 'd like to give earth a giant hug . You 're acting weird . I feel weird , but in a good way . I 'm gonna pee . Yaah ! Ooh ! Octavia ? Octavia ... I think I 'm going crazy , or the grounders are here , or I 'm going crazy , or ... Ok . Just slow down . Just tell me what you saw . Him . Jasper , there 's no one there . He 's right there ! We have to run . We have to run . Why isn 't anyone doing any ... Stop it . Shut up . Jasper , are you on something ? I love you , and I just want you to know this . We 're all gonna die soon , ok ? I love you . Is this all you 've eaten today ? It is , but who the hell cares now ? It 's ... You 're totally bombed . Relax . Here , buddy . Take this . - It 's a stick . - No . This is an anti-grounder stick . So as long as you hold this and you sit right here , grounders won 't be able to see you . - See ? - Yeah . Makes sense . I 'll just stay right here . Does make sense . Stay right there . Get out . Relax . I thought you might be hungry . A peace offering . I shouldn 't have come up here alone earlier . It was stupid and dangerous , and ... he 's not worth it . I won 't tell Bellamy if you won 't . This changes everything . No more running from spears . Ready to be a badass , Clarke ? Look . I 'm not gonna fight you on bringing guns back to camp . I know we need them , but don 't expect me to like it . We 're lucky the rifles were packed in grease . The fact that they survived means we 're not sitting ducks anymore . You need to learn how to do this . So I just hold it on my shoulder ? Yeah , just a little higher now , that end . Yeah . Uh , that 's good . Uh , watch and learn . Still watching . My bullets are duds . Try yours . That was amazing . Ha ! Am I horrible for feeling that ? Try again . No . We shouldn 't waste the ammunition . - You need to practice . - No . We need to talk about how we 're gonna keep guns around camp , where are we gonna keep them , and who has access . You left Miller in charge of the grounder . You must trust him . You should keep him close . The others listen to him . I should keep him close ? Bellamy , what 's going on ? You 've been acting weird all day . All the rations you took . You 're gonna run . That 's why you agreed to come with me . You were gonna load up on supplies and just disappear . I don 't have a choice . The Ark will be here soon . So you 're just gonna leave Octavia ? Octavia hates me . She 'll be fine . You don 't know ... I shot the chancellor . They 're gonna kill me , Clarke . Best-case scenario , they lock me up with the grounder for the rest of my life , and there 's no way in hell I 'm giving Jaha the satisfaction . Keep practicing . I need some air . Bellamy Blake . How are you here ? You 're on The Ark . You shot me on The Ark , but I 've been waiting for you . I did what I had to do . To protect Octavia . That 's right . Pathetic , using your sister to justify your crimes , your cruelty , your selfishness ? If you 're gonna kill me , just do it . Why should I kill you ? Unlike the others , I survived your treachery . What are you talking about ? The 320 souls that were culled from The Ark so that others could live . You knew that they would be sacrificed . The radio . I didn 't know that would happen . It 's not my forgiveness you should seek . It 's theirs . Murderer . Murderer . Murderer . Murderer . Murderer . Murderer . - Murderer . - Stop ! It 's not what you imagined , is it ? Dad ? Hey , is the moon in here ? Monty ... I can 't change the tide if the moon won 't cooperate . Get out of here . It 's basic physics . Oh , stay here . Scratch that . Get out here . You 're not real , are you ? Sorry , kiddo . I wish I were . Wait . How is this possible ? I 'm thinking why more important than how . Why me ? Because I miss you . Think there 's more to it than that , kiddo . You want me to forgive her . Hey ... Your mom loves you , Clarke . She betrayed you . How can I forgive her for that ? The disappointed look isn 't fair . I 'm trying . I 'm trying all the time , but everyone is counting on me , and it 's so hard . Come here . I know , honey . It 's been tough , hasn 't it ? I let someone get tortured . Listen . You 're doing the best you can . You want me to say mom did the best she could . This is about what you want . You 're dead because of her . She doesn 't deserve my forgiveness . Oh ... Listen to me . Forgiveness isn 't about what people deserve . Look . I 'm sorry . I can 't . Whatever . Crazy bitch . Dad ? Don 't move . We need to go now . Why are you doing this ? Just get dressed . They 'll know you helped me . You said it ... you stay here , you 'll die . I 'm not gonna let that happen . I 'm not gonna put you in danger . You need to do this now . Ok . Even in these clothes , I 'll be seen . People are seeing plenty of things right now . Up you get . Ok . Let 's go . What 'd you do ? Set out some of our winter rations a little early . Jobi nuts , the food you gave my guard , they go bad , they cause visions , but it wears off . Just try to get as far away as you can , ok , and try not to get yourself killed . Tell me again . You are the most beautiful broom in a broom closet of brooms . Mm ... I got this one . Hey ... Hey ... Murderer . Murderer . Murderer . Murderer . Murderer . Murderer . Murderer . Please kill me . Kill me ! I deserve it . Please . I can 't fight anymore . Don 't you know ? Life is a fight . What am I supposed to do ? Live , breathe , suffer . You owe them that . You want the peace of death . You 're gonna have to earn it . Agh ! Agh ... Fight back ! Do you think you deserve to be free of your pain ? Do you deserve that gift ? Because you 're gonna get it . Nothing personal . Put it down , Dax . Should 've stayed down there , Clarke . I tried not to kill you , but here you are , and Shumway said no witnesses . What is he talking about ? Shumway set it up . He gave me the gun to shoot the chancellor . Walk away now , and I won 't kill you . Put it down . Your choice . No ! Get the hell off him ! You 're ok . No , I 'm not . My mother ... if she knew what I 've done , who I am ... she raised me to be better , to be good ... Bellamy ... And all I do is hurt people . I 'm a monster . Hey ... You have saved my life today . You may be a total ass half the time , but I need you . We all need you . None of us would 've survived this place if it wasn 't for you . You want forgiveness , fine , I 'll give it to you . You 're forgiven , ok , but you can 't run , Bellamy . You have to come back with me . You have to face it . Like you faced your mom ? You 're right . I don 't want to face my mom . I don 't want to face any of it . All I think about every day is who we 're gonna keep everyone alive , but we don 't have a choice . Jaha will kill me when he comes down . We 'll figure something out . Can we figure it out later ? Whenever you 're ready . Rough night ? Yeah . My head is killing me . You ? I 'm pretty sure I ate a pine cone because it told me to . He 's gone . The grounder is gone . What if he brings other grounders back ? He 'll kill us all . Or worse . Let the grounders come . We 've been afraid of them for far too long , and why ? Because of their knives and Spears . I don 't know about you . I 'm tired of being afraid . Ho ho ho ! No way . These are weapons , ok , not toys , and we have to be prepared to give them up to the guard when the dropships come , but until then , they 're gonna help keep us safe . And there are plenty more where these came from . Tomorrow we start training , and if the grounders come , we 're gonna be ready to fight . I don 't expect you to forgive me , but you 'll have to find a way to live with me ... because I 'm not going anywhere . Bellamy ... It 's time . Grounder escaping , was that you ? I had nothing to do with it . Thanks for the blanket . Mr. Blake , I 've wanted to talk to you for some time now . Before you do , I 'd like to say something . When you sent us down here , you sent us to die , but miraculously , most of us are still alive . In large part , that is because of him , because of Bellamy . He 's one of us , and he deserves to be pardoned of his crimes just like the rest of us . Clarke , I appreciate your point of view , but it 's not that simple . It is if you want to know who on The Ark wants you dead . Bellamy Blake , you 're pardoned for your crimes . Now , tell me who gave you the gun . You 're a disgrace . I 'm fighting for what I believe in , just like you . What , exactly , is that ? I need to check this . Guns ? Really ? The grounder escaping , we have to expect retaliation . We have to be prepared . Yeah . Our ancestors wanted to be prepared , too . So they built bombs . Rifles are not the same as nukes . In Bellamy 's hands , they are . Clarke , come on . You can 't predict what he 's gonna do . There 's no perfect answer , Finn . The grounder saved Octavia 's life , and Bellamy brought him back here and tortured him . Yeah , but if he hadn 't brought him back here , - you 'd be dead . - I know . I trust him . You can 't be serious . I am . Clarke ... You and Bellamy are leading us down a dangerous road . I wish you would 've talked to me about it first . I wish you talked to me about a lot of things , but you didn 't . Thank God it 's you . I thought I was about to float . It won 't come to that , Commander . Wait . What 's going on ? I did what you asked me ...

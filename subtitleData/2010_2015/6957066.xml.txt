 ~ A Thousand Kisses Deep ( 2011 ) ~ The autumn sled across your skin . Got something in my eye . A light that does not need to live , And doesn 't need to die . A riddle in the book of love , Obscure and obsolete . Till witnessed here in time and blood .. A thousand kisses deep . The ponies run , The girls are young . The odds are there to beat . You win a while and then it 's done , Your little winning streak . And summoned now to deal , With your invincible defeat . You live your life as if it 's real , A thousand kisses deep . I didn 't want to leave it in the hall . You never know . - Here you are . - I don 't understand . - Who delivered it ? - I didn 't see . It 's my mother 's things . It must come from the hospice . They have a duty to pass on artifacts to the next of kin . Yeah , I went there . They gave it to me and I binned it . Well , here it is . Somethings is never go away , you know . They just keep coming back . Now , I have work to do . Let 's bring them . Sorry . Hey Mia . You still working nights ? I don 't mind . It 's quite . Max ! Who is that woman ? The old woman . Did you see what just happened ? No , I was downstairs . And there was a dead woman on the pavement and they just took her away . I 've lived here all my life and I ... I saw it for the first time this morning . You are a very busy young woman . You work odd hours . You probably didn 't notice them . You alright ? I need to go upstairs . Thank you . - Welcome to Harmony ! - Coffee please . Have a seat . Don 't you remember me , Buddy ? Mia ! Let me have a look at you ! As gorgeous as ever . Have you seen Ludwig lately ? He disappeared off the face of the Earth . When did you last see him ? Eight years ago . What , you still looking for him after all he did to you ? Every time he hurt you , you crying in my shoulder and then run right back to him . Yeah , well . An old woman in my building jumped out the window this morning . - Did you know her well ? - I didn 't know her at all . But ... she ... knew Ludwig . This is a photo that I took , what ... 10 years ago ? She had this picture with her when she jumped . I thought you said you didn 't know her . - Did you give it to anyone else ? - It was for you . Thanks for the coffee , Buddy . Mia , love , don 't waste it . You 're welcome ! Max . I haven 't forgotten about your radiator . Oh , never mind about the radiator . I wanted to ask you about the old woman upstairs . She kept to herself . Rarely went out . She kept forgetting her key and her own name . She had no friends , no family . I want to take a look at her place . No , c 'mon now ! There is nothing to see . Her apartment is just like yours . No difference . I 'll be in and out . I promise . Won 't do you any good . I insist . Alright . I 'll be five minutes . And you can 't touch anything inside . Nothing ! I swear . Max , why are my things in her flat ? My pictures . Letters addressed to me . Personal things . - You made a promise . - But this is mine ! Belongs to me ! It 's got my name on it . You know what you 've done ? You see this table ? This lamp ? This is where they supposed to be . This letter does not belong here ... Now . You made a mistake , Mia . Time is out of joint . You have to put it back ! We going down ? This lift has a mind of its own . Where are we going , Max ? You 'll have to wait and see . Here we are . We 're on the wrong floor . Max ! ? Somebody has been holding off . You left ! Hey . You look familiar ! I know that we 've met . You are ... ? I 'm on the wrong floor . I live upstairs . You 're not gonna to tell me your name ? May I at least tell you mine ? I 'm Ludwig . Well ... Very nice to meet you , neighbor . Mia ! My girl . She likes to play games . Mia , don 't do this to me ... - Happy birthday angel . - What now . I brought you flowers . I don 't want your flowers . You disappeared secretly ! Does Stella know ? I can 't take this anymore , Ludwig . We 've been through all this before . Go away ! Get out ! Won 't send me away . Not today . Get out ! You want me to leave ? You 're so beautiful . - Like a star from heaven . - No . You 're so fucking beautiful . You know that ? Come here . Come here . I have to ... I have to , tell you something . Go to go to New York . America . Friend of mine he 's line up some place for me , there . I mean , I know that I should have told you any earlier . It kills me ... to think of be away from you for so long . I 've burnt too many bridges here , Mia . I need a fresh start . And I 've got to get back to the music . You told me ... You told me that ... I 'm doing this for us . You 're not coming back , are you ? - How can you say that ? - Don 't know ! Trust me , Mia . Angel ... I hate you . I 'll be back before you know it . I promise . Lilly , hey ! You didn 't put it back ? I didn 't have chance to . The cat shouldn 't be here . Everything is out of place . I just want to go home , Max . So do I. Lilly ... Oops , I shouldn 't be in here . You going to get water into my trumpet . Not tonight . Don 't press me , Mia . Or I won 't be able to play a tune . - Yay ! - ♫ ... ♫ You 're a sculptural . You know ? You know we weren 't very happy there ? That 's ... It 's because I wasn 't . Your mother , she reminds me of someone . Those ridiculous glasses ! My father gave them to her on their anniversary . He thought it gave her an air of glamor . Going to get dressed . No , you can 't go . It 's my birthday ! - Your birthday ! - Ludwig , no , no , no . Please , please , please . Oh , c 'mon . Please stay , I 'll put milk in your brown lulu . You would like it . Put milk in my brown lulu the way I like it . Speaking of which , where is my watch ? Come on ! What are you going to do ? Run back to your old hack ? - Hey ! - Hey what ? Watch your mouth ! I 'm not staying here by myself . I 'm going out too . No , you are not . You are not going anywhere . Until you bring me back my watch . I didn 't take your stupid watch ! Yes , you did take my fucking ... fucking watch ! Give me my fucking watch ! You think that 's gonna make me stay here , do you ? Do you ? I 'm sorry for shouting at you . Okay . What you doing ? Let 's play a favorite game . Oh , please . - Give me your hands . C 'mon . - Stop . No , please . - Hurting me with ... - Shhh ... Stop ! Please ! You know ? Sweetheart , come here . Look at me . Look at me . I love you so much . Please ... I hate you ! Ludwig ! Lilly , where are you ? Come here girl ! Are we scare of him ? Just a fake . He doesn 't mean anything bad . You know he loves me . Lilly . Rise and shine , sleepyhead . Your breakfast is served . - Really hurt me , you know ? - I know , but you love it . And you wouldn 't have it any other way . You really think so ? Trust me . I know you better than you know yourself . - Untie me ... - Not until ... you have some breakfast . C 'mon . Good girl ! Now , tell me . Do you remember where you put my watch ? You kidding me . That watch has sentimental value . Ah ... Stella gave it to me on our wedding anniversary and it 's very , very important for me to get it back . I didn 't take your watch . And I don 't want to hear about your wife . Do you know that we made love last night in the cellar . And it was the best sex we had in awhile . But you know , I was thinking about when she was slobbering all over me . Who ? You stupid , who else ? You know that ... I love you ... I always will . I mean ... We are like Siamese twins , baby . And no matter what happens ... we 'll always be together . Ah , you go to the restaurant at 5 . Don 't be late . Lilly ? You can come out now . Yeah , I told you he 'll come back ! You don 't need to be scared . See ? I 'm fine . Lilly . I 'm have to go now . You 've been a little shit . You don 't come out , I 'm not going to leave you any food . Fine . Tell Ludwig to hurry up with that change . She 's good . The waitress , she 's good . You hear about the ad in the paper ? You should talk to my husband . Oh ! Great catch . Ah ! A new face . My name is Ludwig . And you are ? Mia . Really ? She is here about the ad . So ... You want to be a waitress ? No . Well , that 's what the ad was for . I didn 't read the ad . Okay ... Well how can I help you ? You already helped me . Now returning the favor . What is all this about ? It 's about your husband ... You should rein him in a little else his prickle get him into trouble . Especially if he keeps leaving his things in other women 's apartments . - Not the clock . - That 's ... How much did the little bitch pay you to do her dirty work ? Mia ! Come here ! Even took a name for the role . That 's very fucking original . Stella , you see what is going on here , don 't you ? I mean ... Mia is upset because I didn 't give her a pay rise . They set this up . She stole my watch , gave it to her friend . I don 't know what 's going on . Really ? Angel ... Don 't angel me ! You think I 'm stupid ? No , I got to hear it from strangers . I am done with you . Don 't ... Don 't worry about it . Mia ! My child . Come here . How ... fucking ... dare you . You low-class piece of shit ? I gave you a fucking job . I treated you nice . I kept you working here . Even after all the customer complaints ! And this is how you pay me back ? By what ? By stealing my watch . And sending your friend here to embarrass me , to ... to blackmail me ? Why ! Why ? Do you really think ... that I would choose you over Stella ? And this place ? Do you think that you 're so special ? It 's over . Just ... leave . Get out ! I 'm sorry . Drinks for everyone , buddy , on the house . Coming right up . So ... Can I help you with anything else ? That 'd be all , thank you . What the fuck ... What did you do that for ? I have to talk to you , it 's important . Are you in love with Ludwig ? This isn 't about Ludwig ! It is about you . You don 't know shit about me ! When you were in Year 3 , Mary Reilly stabbing you with a fountain pen right here . There was blood and ink all over the place . You still have the scar ! Ludwig loves that scar . He says it that just hid from the gun shot . How do you know that ? He 'll keep hurting you ... and humiliating you and dumping you for someone else . That 's okay , it 's a fake . So cool . So handsome . So mature . So what if he 's married ? He treated you like no one else . And then , you wake up one morning and he 'll be gone . Just like that . And the sleeping pills you 'll take should have killed you ... and they don 't . This would tell you it 's a miracle you survived . But you 'd just wish that you were dead . What 're you talking about ? The letters he 'll sent you . He has a way with words . He never sent me that ! You stay with him , he will . What you want from me ? I want you to stop destroy yourself . Just forget you ever met him . Get as far away from him as you can . Because if you stay , you 're screwed . And not just for now , but for the rest of your life . And no amount of abortions , doctors or one-night stands will save you . Just get your life back . Please don 't waste it . I should be amended . I know . You have to leave before Stella sees you . I don 't care about Stella . I have to see him . This is important . That woman , I never met her , but she knows things about me that nobody knows . Now listen to me ... He 's not here . I talked to him already . He knows it 's a misunderstanding . And whoever that woman was , she has nothing to do with you . Just go home , Mia . Go home . Just been out of service all day . Lilly ! You must be hungry ! Nobody fed you . We all forgot about you . Sorry . We 've to find you something to eat . Kitty ... Hungry ? You meet someone for the first time , and ... feels like you known them all your life . Like ... If always been a part of you , and you only realized that moment . Ever felt that ? Never . Those moments sure make life worth living . My God ! Oh , my God ! Oh , God ! Come back ! Mia ! Get some help ! Excuse me . Yes , how can I help ? Can you tell me where the spare bathroom is , please ? - Over there . - Thanks . What 're you doing ? I am showing the flat to prospective tenants . What do you doing ? It 's not for rent . I 'm still here . No , you are not . You were hit by a car . You still have further to go . I 'm sorry . Max ! Max ! C 'mon ! Which one you little ... You okay ? Can I help ? I think I 'm beyond help . This is important ... I have to speak with your daughter . You know where she is ? Mia ? She 's always running around . Ever since her dad died , she makes up any excuse not to spend any time at home with me . Even on her birthday . Is her birthday . She 's turning 18 . Why ? Do you know my daughter ? I have to go . Why ? What you want from her ? $ 200 , $ 600 , $ 650 ... $ 700 ... Mia dear , help Buddy with the tables . When you 're done , you can go home . Okay . How do we do tonight ? Well , we broke even . I 'm so closing up early . We should let Mia go . Buddy can handle things on his own . No , we need somebody to open up early . Can 't believe that 's him . It looks so sad now . You should see him with his band . He lit up this place . Queues around the block . Well , you probably weren 't even born then . Why doesn 't he play anymore ? Stella found him with a needle stuck in his arm ... again . And he can 't face the crowds without the drugs , and ... She made him stop . So asterisk that mean : No drugs , no trumpet . No wonder he 's so unhappy . Time to go home . Good night . - Good night . - Good night , Buddy . - Bye . - Good night Mia . She 's pretty . She 's young enough to be my daughter . Besides , I only got eyes for you . You know that . I was just teasing you . You , um ... Go home , relax . I will lock up . Don 't stay too long . I hate watching tele by myself . Forgot something ? I ... I think I left my handbag . Thanks . What was your birthday wish ? How did you know ? Buddy told me . Buddy has a big mouth . Well , you don 't have to tell me if you don 't want to . Okay ... My birthday wish ... is to hear you play the trumpet . I love jazz . I don 't play anymore . If I don 't play , you 'll be disappointed . You can 't go up . You know that . What was I supposed to do ? I don 't know . I 'm sorry . Help me , please ! Take me there . Ah , morning , Max . - Morning , Doug . - You look well . So do you . Where 're you off to today ? We 're going to the park to see the clown . The clown in the park ? They had someone play in the park last week , and ... She thinks they 'll be there again today . It 's my birthday tomorrow . Yes , I know . Happy birthday for tomorrow , Mia . How old will you be ? I 'll be 10 . How old do you ? You know I 'm very old . 500 years old . I 'm too old for lollipops . What do you say ?

Go to packing up , my little girl . Sorry . Please . No , tomorrow , alright ? Do you have any money ? Five . That should be enough . Alright . Consider it a favor . No , the real song . " Real song " ? Ho ... ho ... I like that . A real song for the nice real girl . Mia , we need to leave . We have to leave right now . You need to get away from the clown . Hey ! - C 'mon ! - I want to watch him ! - What the fuck you think you 're doing ? - Sorry . - Dad ! - One second , sweetheart . Thanks . Trying to get me away from that trumpet . I want the clown in my party . You don 't want him in the party , darling . He 's just a trump . I want her to come too ! Whatever ! You deal with it , Doug . I 'm going home . Ah ... You ... You go with mommy , sweetheart . I ... I 'll sort things out , I promise . Look , my daughter would like you to come to her birthday party tomorrow . Just for an hour .

You are welcome to come too if ... if you like . Yeah . You must be a fan . Do you want my autograph ? Do you want to shake my hand ? I need to talk to you . Okay . Um ...

I don 't have one . A bottle of whiskey for me . And the little lady , we know ' em . Don 't you have any pride ? Look what you are doing to yourself . Stella , look , I am so loaded . Buddy , Buddy ! Can you vouch for me , please . - C 'mon . - It 's Stella 's place , Ludwig . I do what she says . Come work for me . You have a roof over you ready and a stage to play on . Stella ... Just one drink , please . No . It 's for your own good . She 's right . C 'mon , let 's go . Change your mind , you know where to find me . Still like me , yeah ? Alright Ludwig .

Good , good . Take this . It was a present from Dessi . He ... I mean , he used to blow the roof off with Bruno with that . Ask anybody , it 's ... Worth a 100 times more than what I owe you . Now these things are of value . My aunt sold a piano for £ 2,000 . This is your lucky day . Now fuck off out of my car . You don 't learn , do you ? You lost everything ! You hit the bottom . I 'm always at the bottom of a bottomless pad . Leave London . There is nothing left for you here anymore . Look at you . Sure , go to Montana , live on a ranch , walk off the fire and I 'll breed rabbits . That 's good . Go to America . Hey , you know what ? My dad , he lives in New Orleans , or Charlotte , or ... somewhere like that . I could go and see him , because I haven 't seen him for a while . Why don 't you go and see him . Stay with him for a few years while you get back on your feet . You never know , you might like it . You have all worked out for me , haven 't you ? You need a new start . Somewhere far away where nobody knows you . Look , I got money . Enough to tie you over for awhile . But you have to leave ! Thank you so much ! You 're my guardian angel . My savior ! I 'll never forget you . I hope to God you will . Good day . Ah , this is ... [ On the radio ] Why didn 't the skeleton cross the road ? Because he didn 't have the guts to do .

I need to see the beauty of the world around me . Enjoy every moment as if it were my last . Maybe go see a doctor . Guess what ? I did . Nobody told me ... The key to happiness in life is not having what you want . But wanting what you have . I told him to go fuck himself and give me my money back . Mia ! Cake 's ready . Come blow your candles out .

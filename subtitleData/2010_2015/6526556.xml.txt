 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... - Someone shot her . - Artie killed Leena . We 've all been whammied at some point , right ? I cast you out . Claudia , no ! You separated the evil from Artie . You knew the world needed saving even if it cost you the only father you 've ever known . Holy metaphor . - Artie 's brain is ... - The Warehouse . What 's wrong ? It 's reality finding its way in . It 's the fight that matters , Artie . Now go . No ! Yes ! I have something to say . Ever since I started working here , what I thought I knew about the world , it--it changes pretty much every day . Artie did what he did with the astrolabe to save Warehouse 13 . To save all of us . As far as we know , to save the whole damn world . Sometimes artifacts , they--they can do terrible , unspeakable things to people . I mean , heck , one time an artifact made me think I slept with Myka . - Pete ! - Exactly . What happened after the astrolabe- - Brother Adrian , the stolen artifacts , the orchid ... Leena- - That wasn 't Artie . What I know about the world , it changes every day . There 's one thing that doesn 't change . Warehouse 13 does not work without this man . We need him . You need him . Thank you , Agent Lattimer . But we 'd already come to the same conclusion . - Wha--oh . Well , then there you go . - You 've what ? - No , Artie . Shh , no , I 'm- - I 'm resting my case . We see no need for punishment at this juncture . You can 't be serious . Leena was a valued member of the team and a friend . But she knew the risks and accepted them . This is her video signature statement . We thought seeing it might give you some closure . Her death was a tragic , yet unavoidable casualty in our ongoing mission . We are reinstating you as soon as possible . I killed her ! Did you ? Did Arthur Nielson kill Leena ? Would you have willingly taken her life--any life- - No . But it doesn 't change the fact she died by my hand . And you will have to live with that . I fear that sentence is far more severe than any this tribunal could mete out . Adrian : [ Echoing ] An evil that will live with you the rest of your days . We 're adjourned . Claude , what is it ? They didn 't say anything about it . About what ? I cast you out ! Nothing . Never mind . Artie , maybe we should talk about what happened back there . No , we probably shouldn 't . Maybe we should just give him his space . No , no , Pete . His space is really , really dark right now . Did you hear him ? He wanted to be punished . He is not okay , Pete . Maybe he 'll never be okay . I mean , we just got him back and now he 's farther away than ever . And where is Claudia ? She went back to the BB . I don 't know . Maybe she 's avoiding the Warehouse or Artie or both . I do not like what 's happening . Yeah , well , like you 've been saying , Mykes . We just need to keep moving , okay ? And I 'm sure some scary artifact thing will come up before we can say " ping . " Pick up ! Pick up ! It 's Linus Bentley ! Somebody knows ! We gotta get out ! We gotta ! Oh , God ! Please ! You don 't understand . Please ! What are you- - what are you doing ? What are you doing ? Oh , my God . Oh , my God ! Please stop ! Help me ! Stop ! My God ! No ! Please ! Please stop ! Help me ! Oh , my God ! Help me ! Oh , God ! Warehouse 13 04x12 - " Parks And Rehabilitation " Original Air Date - April 23 , 2013 That is about the deadest guy I 've ever seen . Did you talk to the people who found the body ? Yeah , yeah , a couple of day hikers said they heard a scream , felt a tremor , and then something about a blue glow . A man gets sucked into the ground . Well , it sounds like an artifact to me . Yeah , maybe something quicksand-related . Promises to be loads of fun though . How 's Claudia ? Eh , she 's up looking for clues . Not really the outdoorsy type . I think it was a good idea for her to come with me . It 'll keep her mind off Artie . How 's he doing ? Well , he 's been in the stacks all morning . Steve and I are gonna go look for him in a bit . Oh , an ATV ! Oh , man I love ATVs . Hey , Mykes , you think the Warehouse - could get a decked out- - - No . Hello ? - Hi there . - Hey . Special Agent Pete Lattimer , Secret Service . Whoa . - No . Secret Service ? - Yeah . That is very cool . I 'm Ranger Evan Smith . Ranger Smith ? " Hey , Mr. Ranger , sir . " I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . Man , you probably get that all the time . " Hey , Boo-Boo . " - Nope , can 't say that I do . - What ? - No . - No ? The--the cartoon ? - Listen , uh ... - Right . People are freaking out about this . Seismic activity doesn 't usually limit itself to a few square yards , you know what I mean ? Mm-hmm . How does something like this even happen ? Well , you 'd be surprised at the kind of things that could happen . " Go with Pete , " they said . " You 'll love it . Sunshine and fresh air . " Ow ! Why am I so delicious to you ? I 've sat on too many laptops not to know that sound . Hey . What did you find ? I think--yep . Buried cell phone . Coincidence ? Hardly ever . Can you hack it ? - I think- - - Oh . Might take me a little bit . Well , Bentley could have dropped it on his way down . Who ? Linus Bentley , our victim . He 's the president of Qualcascommunications . I got his wallet and his cards , but no artifact on him . Which might mean somebody else did the whammying ? Let 's find out who would want this guy dead , huh ? All right , scanning for info now . Ugh , my connection sucks out here . You know we 're in the middle of a forest , right ? [ Hisses ] Ow ! Stop that . Well aware . I 'll kill your whole family . [ Electronic beep ] Okay . Linus Bentley , telecom guru . His name 's all over the Oregon blogosphere . Apparently a substation Qualcast is building is drawing the wrath of Green First , a local nonprofit , claiming that the signals are disturbing a local owl sanctuary , probably killing bees . Oh , they 've been trying to get construction shut down . Bentley 's a good place to start if green first wanted this project buried . - All right , you guys ready ? - Yeah , let 's go . All right , up . Come on . Bad choice of words . It 's just that he 's in a really scary place right now and I just--I hate to think about him wandering by himself down here in crazy town . You don 't think that he would do anything ? I--I don 't- - - Oh , my God ! Artie ! - Artie ! Don 't ! Aah ! Ow ! Ah ! What is wrong with you ? Us ? You with the--the--the blade ! No ? " No " what ? I was redistributing its energy weight . Has to be done every 90 days . What are you doing here anyway ? I thought you were on a ping with Pete in Oregon . I sent Claudia with Pete . - You sent ? - Uh-huh . Since when do you- - You know what ? It 's fine . It 's fine with me . Whatever . No , Artie , yell at me , please . - I said it was fine . - No ! I should have consulted you . I should have- - Myka , stop . - [ Sighs ] - What 's this ? It 's nothing . Give it--give that to me . What is this ? " Leena 's list " ? [ Sighs ] Yes , it 's , uh , things that ... she did to keep certain artifacts in balance . Somebody--somebody has to keep doing it . Anyway . Doesn 't matter . Just leave it . Leave me alone . Artie , let us help you . - Yeah . - Help me ? I 've been doing this job alone for 35 years . - Thank you very much . - You know what ? Fine , Artie . You just go do everything by yourself , and we 'll just follow you around and watch you . Fine . Good luck with that . - Clean up that mess you made ! - [ Sighs ] Ah , so this is an environmental nonprofit , huh ? Yeah , what 'd you expect ? I don 't know . Hippies in tie-dye singing Age Of Aquarius . You know Vietnam 's over , right ? For those of us who 've watched the director 's cut of Platoon , it 'll never be over . Okay , great . Start with the block of spaulding near the community gardens . We only need another 65 signatures . - Hello . - Hi . You look like you might be in charge . Hi . Yes . Welcome to Green First . I 'm Autumn Radnor . Thank you for coming . Oh , it 's great to see people coming out to help with their dads . Ahh , that 's what it feels like to be shot . We just moved into the storefront , so it 's a little hectic around here , but I know they could really use some help in the phone bank . Uh , no , me and my non-related - work-partner-colleague - who 's-really-not-young-enough - to-be-my-daughter person and I have some questions about Linus Bentley . Seriously ? He 's using the government to intimidate us now ? That is pretty desperate . You can tell him we 're not backing down . We 're not here about the birds . - Owls . - Owls are birds . It 's not just about the owls . It 's about greed . " We do not ride the railroad , it rides upon us . " Ding ! Who is Henry David Thoreau ? Six years of college , so ... If we don 't stop them here , it 's only a matter of time before we lose the forest completely . Look , you can tell him- - Look , Ferngully , we understand that you 're pissed , okay ? But Bentley didn 't send us . Actually , he 's- - he 's dead . Linus is- - he 's--he 's dead ? Oh , my God . He was killed in the Cowan National Forest ... ironically . Excuse me , I ... have to make a call . Um , Becky will answer any of your questions . So Bentley was in the woods yesterday because he was scouting locations for cell towers . Well , that makes sense , but she doesn 't . I mean , first thing , he 's the devil . Next thing you know , she 's crying over his death . I don 't know if that 's suspicious or just another facet of women I 'll never understand . Is there anything about women you understand ? Booby region . [ Cell phone rings ] Oh . [ Beep ] Bingo . I cloned his SIM card . It was damaged , but I managed to get a few numbers . - Anything good ? - Couple of calls to the office , and the last one to a different number yesterday afternoon . A place called " Fine Young Cannabis Organic Healing . " It 's just that Bentley didn 't seem like the kind of guy that 'd be into medical marijuana . Oh , this place smells like my guitar teacher . Geoff Nevins ? Mr. Nevins ? Hello ? Is anybody here ? We 're not cops . You know just about every cop who comes in here probably says that . Good point . Okay ! We 're the cops ! Claude . [ Beep ] Pick up , Geoff ! Pick up ! It 's Linus Bentley ! Somebody knows ! We gotta get out ! We gotta- - Oh , God ! [ Beep ] Blue glow . Wanna take a wild guess why he never got that message ? Holy ganja , Batman . Ah , well , the blue glow is from the grow lights . [ Exhales ] - Uh , Pete ? - Yeah ? Look at this . Isn 't that the same symbol that was carved into the tree in the woods ? Yes , it is . Looks like Geoff Nevins is taking a dirt nap . Hey , I got the Warehouse system looking for anything that moves dirt . So far , no luck . This symbol , I 've seen it before . Yeah , back in the woods , but- - Somewhere else . May I ? [ Scatting ] What are you doing ? Tippy-tappy is my thing . Uh , Secret Service Database , so ... Ah . [ Electronic beeping ] I forgot my password . May I ? [ Beep ] Really ? " Peterulz23 " ? All right . Yeah , I remember thinking it was weird when " Peterulz " 1 through 22 were taken . And ... bazinga . See ? I know things . Wow . Okay . Details ? About ten years ago , there was a psycho group of tree-huggers from the northwest . They called themselves The Last People On Earth . This calls them eco-terrorists . That 's the psycho part . Anything with " terror " in it comes up on our radar . These guys did some pretty gnarly vandalism at some logging sites in Oregon . Wow , these guys were hardcore . Used the Cowan Forest as their cover , hit dozens of construction sites over two years . The Lorax meets Red Dawn . Says here they dropped off the map ten years ago . So why are they back now ? I don 't know . Maybe they got their green thumbs on an artifact . Instead of just burning down equipment , now they 're- - They 're going right to the source . They 're killing anyone they think is harming the environment . Linus Bentley was gonna tear up the forest for cell phone towers . All right , well , how do we find these Last People On Earth ? Okay , most of the members stayed anonymous . Only one they caught was Ryan Clayton , and he died in prison a year ago . Maybe they 're back at their old digs ? The FBI trace them to an abandoned cabin in Cowan Forest . Oh , and I know just the ... [ As Yogi Bear ] Mr. Ranger sir to lead Yogi and Boo-Boo directly to a pic-a-nic central . Roo-roo . I 've never been in here before . [ Sighs ] Artie , what is this ? It 's where she wor- - It 's where Leena worked . [ Sighs ] It 's very peaceful . Yes , it is . What is this circle ? It 's a feng shui spiral that originated in Warehouse Six . It reads our more difficult artifacts . Determines the overpowering emotion behind their creation . So we can shelve them properly . Yes , it 's how Leena interpreted an artifact 's energy . Where 's the porthole from ? Oh , that 's , uh--that 's from the airship Norge , right ? It was the first dirigible to cross the North Pole . Pete and I snagged that , what , Artie , two years ago ? Yes , it 's been in the Ovoid Quarantine ever since . It 's time we gave it a home . [ Sighs ] [ Shimmering tone ] I think you should buy a vowel . - I would imagine ... - It means " great sorrow . " Thank you . Uh ... All right , aisle ... Toledo 81-K . Satisfied I 'm not gonna beat myself to death with this porthole ? Fine . Good-bye now . I don 't think our presence is having the desired effect . So this is the place ? It 's nothing but a burned-out shack now . What happened ? A forest fire ? Well , the story I heard was that the FBI got a lead on one of those last earth guys , they chased him up here , and set fire to the place before he got arrested . Uh , listen , if you guys can find your own way back ... I gotta go deal with a drum circle in the picnic meadow . Ooh , well , I got some tear gas in the car if you wanna ... [ Imitates tear gas exploding ] [ Mock crying ] I 'm joking , ' cause it 's just a drum circle , so ... So ... why would Ryan Clayton burn down his own group 's base ? Uh , force of habit ? His favorite thing is burning things down . Oh , wow . That 's beautiful . Yeah , shoulda focused more on the art and less on the arson . You know , if the LPE are back in action , I don 't think they 're working from here . Hey , Claude , check this out . " In wildness is the preservation of the world . " Yeah , it 's the lyrics to an awesome Metallica song , but it 's also a Henry David Thoreau quote . Now , who do we know that 's protesting Bentley that 's against medical marijuana farming and likes to quote HDT ? You think Autumn is one of The Last People On Earth ? Well , collecting petitions is nice , but nothing says " Stop raping the forest " like an artifact . [ Tires screeching ] She pulls out the artifact , stay away from dirt . That 's my everyday philosophy . [ Thud ] Looks like she was making a break for it . Think she got out the window ? Yeah , yeah , she , uh ... She 's probably long gone by now . We 'll never catch her . We might as well go back ... - to the hotel ! - Get away from me ! Aah ! [ Both grunting ] Aah ! Ugh ! God ! Peppers ... so good in burritos , so bad in the eyes . - Pete , watch it . - Oh , thanks . - Where 's the artifact ? - The what ? Whatever you used to bury Bentley and Nevins . You think I killed them ? Well , the whole packing and fleeing thing is kind of a dead giveaway . We know you were part of The Last People On Earth and now you 're picking off mother nature 's enemies . - No , they were my friends . - What ? Your friends ? Yes , I was a member , but so was Linus , so was Geoff . What ? They were all LPE ? Yes , we all were . And now someone knows who we are , what we did , and they 're killing us one by one . I probably shouldn 't have held on to this , but I just couldn 't help myself . Oh , is that you ? And , uh , there 's Linus and Geoff . What about these two ? That 's Annie . She died of cancer two years back . - And that 's Ryan . - Oh , yeah . The guy who took the rap and died in prison . The FBI ID 'd him . Hunted him up to the cabin . He burned it down to keep them from finding any evidence linking the rest of us to the LPE . So how 'd the group get started ? We met in college . Found out we all had the same concerns and interests . Like vandalism , pyromania ? Like protecting the Cowan Forest from Lockhart Logging . They were tearing it apart and we had to stop them before there was nothing left . By blowing up their equipment ? We were young and idealistic ... and stupid . It wasn 't like that at the start , but things started getting crazy . We were hitting bigger targets , causing more damage , and then ... someone got hurt . It scared us . So you all just walked away ? Are you gonna arrest me ? It 's not really our thing . Lockhart Logging . I mean , if anyone wanted you guys dead after all this time- - Haddon Lockhart runs the company . He really , really didn 't like us . To be fair , you blew up a lot of his stuff . Worse . We never wanted to hurt anyone , and we thought the logging site was empty for the night , but Lockhart was there . He was the one who was hurt in the explosion . So if anyone has a reason to want you dead- - Where is Lockhart these days ? Still running the company . Okay , look , I 'm gonna go talk to him . Claude , stay with Autumn , okay ? Make sure he doesn 't get to her . You got it . [ Shimmering tone ] [ Rumbling ] - [ Exhales ] - Artie , so ... You 're not gonna watch it ? Won 't change anything . Won 't bring her back . You know , I remember when I made my signature statement . Saying it out loud , talking about the risks and the dangers , it was so scary . But it ... It kind of makes you realize how important this is , you know ? She didn 't understand . She did not agree to this . Yes , she did . We all did . You should watch it . [ Electronic tones ] Wait . Isn 't--isn 't that where- - That is where we shelved the Norge Porthole . This is bad . We have to go . Secret Service ? What 's this about ? Do you remember a group called The Last People On Earth ? [ Sighs ] You damn right I do . Those crazy bunch of maniacs ... nearly killed me . They firebombed my construction yard . Maybe they didn 't know you were there . They 're a bunch of psychos . If I ever find out who the rest of them were- - You 'd what ? Bury ' em alive ? That 'd be too good for them . It took years--years- - to get that camp up and running again . Hundreds of lost jobs , millions in lost revenue . I thought they 'd all be in jail by now . How did the FBI get a lead on Ryan Clayton ? That was an anonymous tip . And he refused to identify his cohorts . You see this ? This was the happiest day of my life . The day I stood up and testified against that terrorist . All of his family were there , all of them in shock . But you know what ? You raise a monster , that 's what happens . Oh , my God . [ Gasps ] I haven 't seen this in a long time . 2002 Sasquatch Festival . I drove all night for that . Ryan didn 't want to go , but I dragged him for backup while I stalked Adam Duritz . - No , you did not . - Yes , I did . Oh , my God . Why would you do that ? Because I had a real thing for dreadlocks . - Eww ! - I know . They were terrible ones too . It wasn 't pretty . So , uh ... Do you ever have any regrets about the whole you-were-by-definition - a-terrorist thing ? We made some bad decisions . Really bad ones . But we did good things too . The LPE was the first time I felt like something I was doing mattered . I never gave much thought to tomorrow . [ Sighs ] I , uh--man . I think about tomorrow all the time right now . Why 's that ? Uh , well ... Couple of weeks ago , I got into a fight , um ... with someone at work- - my boss- - and I had to do something that ... I thought could help him , but also could possibly kill him . That last part doesn 't sound like a metaphor . Long story . Didn 't actually kill him , by the way . I just- - [ Sighs ] Now I don 't know what to do about it with him . Oh , Claudia , when I was your age , I was a mess . Maybe everyone 's a mess in their 20s . And you don 't get any do-overs . You just get older and figure things out as you go . [ Glass shatters ] Shh . [ Cell phone vibrates ] Stop right there . Hello , Autumn . Evan ? That 's Ranger Smith . What ? No , that 's Evan . Ryan 's brother Evan . Well , I had to change my name . It 's pretty tough to get a government job when you 're related to a convicted terrorist . That 's what 's doing it . That--dude , that lantern- - - You wanna see what it does ? - No , no , I 'm good . [ Shimmering tone ] [ Screaming ] [ Grunts ] Claudia ! Aah ! Stop ! [ Screams ] Evan , you killed the others ? One of you betrayed Ryan and turned him in to Lockhart and his goons . You don 't know what happened ! What Ryan- - No , stop ! Just stop ! You 're the worst of the bunch . I was just a kid when you sent my brother to prison . Now I 'm gonna get justice for him . Freeze ! Oh , great . Yogi 's here . Drop that lantern . You drop first . [ Shimmering tone ] [ Screams ] Sleep tight . Get in . Oh ! Oh ! No ! No ! [ Screaming ] Ah , no . No . No , no , no , no ! Damn it ! [ Muffled screams ] Oh , my God . Pete ! Oh , my God . Pete ! - Aah ! [ Grunting , gasping ] Are you okay ? I got dirt in places ... [ spits ] where dirt should never be , but otherwise , yeah , I 'm fine . Listen , Evan Smith is actually ... Evan Clayton . I saw the picture in Lockhart 's office . He 's no Ranger Smith and he lied ! He knows who Yogi Bear is . He 's a liar ! He took Autumn ! I don 't know where he went . Kept her alive for a reason . We gotta find out why . Come on , Claude . Let 's go . [ Shimmering , buzzing ] Jeez . What is happening ? I was in Ovoid when I heard the alarm . Artifacts must have done this by themselves . All right . - What the hell is that ? - It 's a goo-nade . Claudia made it . She has to put her name on everything . Well , should we take cover ? Or you could just throw it and we 'll see what happens . - [ Coughs ] - [ Coughs ] Uh ... Started here at the Norge Porthole . Artie ! This crate has busted open from the inside . It says " Da Vinci 's gargoyle " ? I don 't like the sound of that . [ Creature growls ] Actually , that sound- - that 's the one I don 't like . Everybody get down ! [ Creature roars ] Damn it . He took Autumn someplace else . So how did he figure out who the other members were if Ryan never talked ? Claude , I think this might be Ryan 's old journal . Listen to this : " Successful strike with September " and Purple Haze today . Lockhart out of commission soon . " Code names . In case the journal was discovered , he wanted to protect their identities . Obviously , Geoff Nevins is Purple Haze , and September is the first month in autumn . So Evan must have found that journal after his brother died and figured out who the other members were that way . He must think they sold his brother out . How much damage can he do with that thing ? I don 't know , but I bet I know where . Does Lockhart 's main logging camp seem like a sure bet ? If he 's going after the people who wronged his brother . Lockhart 's at the top of that list , and I doubt Evan cares how many people he takes out with him . Should be just a few more miles down . Whoa ! Well , whatever Evan 's planning , he wants privacy . We 'll never make it in time on foot . Do you think your Prius can jump the chasm ? Probably not . But while we 're airborne , we can check bing to see how deep the hole is as we plummet to our deaths . Or maybe we go off-road . Yee-ha ! There are no men . Only boys . You all right ? I was just attacked by a stone gargoyle . It 's probably gonna be one of my new favorite scars . - Artie , is that thing alive ? - No , no , no , no . It 's a machine . It 's one of Da Vinci 's lost inventions . At the end of his life , the Italian government commissioned him to build a device to protect the treasures of the Milan ... Cathedral ! Let me guess : It worked too well and kept everyone away . Well , it says here the agents from warehouse Eight got lucky . It was struck with a bolt of lightning , shutting it down long enough to snag and bag . - Got lucky ? - Yeah . Look , uh , I left my Tesla back in the office . - But I could keep low- - - Tesla ? No , no , no , no , no . Tesla--no , no , no . One bolt isn 't gonna be strong enough , but- - Aha ! That means he has an idea . I 'm not gonna evacuate my camp because of some eco-freak . Look , this guy is dangerous . He shut down the road to the camp . He 's probably already here . And my men and I will handle it our way . I 'm not gonna hand over this entire operation on a silver platter . - [ Scoffs ] - No sign of him . Do we think the lantern 's strong enough to sink the whole camp ? [ Shudders ] I recognize that look . Vibe ? Claude ... that cliff . I 'll bet he 's up there . A landslide from there could bury the whole camp . [ Boom ] Let 's go ! [ All shouting ] Oh , God . I hate when I 'm right . You 're going to kill all those people ! Where was your compassion for Ryan ? Huh ? He never gave you up . Not once . Not to me , not to the police , no one . Could have kept him out of prison . You know that ? He died in a cage for your cause while the rest of you got to live your lives . Evan , you can still stop this . No , Autumn ... I read his journal . He loved you . And I loved him . You 're a liar ! That 's why I saved you for last . I wanted you to watch the others die ! After I take this place out , they 'll find you and you 'll die a terrorist for all those things you did before . Same fate that you left for my brother ! [ Grunts ] Ha ! Who 's smarter than the average bear now ? Autumn , grab the lantern ! Hey , Claudia . Claudia , no ! Claudia ! That 's not good . Steve , you ready ? I hate this plan . Why do I have to be the bait ? 'Cause it already likes you . As in it 's tasted my blood and wants more . Another way of putting it . [ Creature growls ] [ Creature roars ] I think it sees me . Well , then go ! Run ! Yeah , sort of my only option . [ Creature roars ] [ Screams ] You only get one shot at this ! Yeah , it relaxes me . Aah ! [ Creature growls ] [ Electricity buzzes ] Ah ! Great . - [ Laughs ] - Oh , my God . - Are you okay ? - Yeah , yeah . Nice shot , Myka . But I still don 't understand what caused all this . Must be the porthole . Right ? We must have shelved it in the wrong place . No , no , the spiral was very clear . Well , maybe there 's something wrong with the spiral . [ Shimmering tone ] Wait . - What are you doing ? - Here 's the plan . You 're gonna lower me down with the belt and I 'm gonna grab the lantern . - Pete , no ! - Claudia- - I 'm lighter ! Damn it . I hate when you 're right ! [ Rumbling ] Me too . Careful . Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! Don 't twist the belt . It 's Prada . I 'll make that my priority . Careful . Get it . [ Grunts ] - [ Grunting ] - Get it . - You got it . - Yeah . Bringing you up . [ Both grunting ] Come here . Good job . Ah ! How many times can we try this ? [ Shimmering tone ] That 's a different symbol again . It means ... " misplaced anger . " Five readings , five different results . Something wrong with the spiral . Artie , this doesn 't make any sense . The Airship Norge was the first to cross the North Pole . Anger , sorrow--those emotions have no connection to that at all . I 'm gonna put this back in the Ovoid , let it be a problem for Warehouse 14 . Artie , what if it isn 't the spiral that 's not working ? What if it 's ... you know , perhaps ... the person who 's using the spiral ? Maybe ? I mean , look at this place . It 's so serene . And maybe--maybe the spiral worked for Leena because she was so calm and centered . That makes sense . It 's the only way it could get an accurate reading . But the spiral read me . Anger , sorrow , fear . [ Sighs ] How the hell am I supposed to do this ? With us . Artie ... You don 't have to do this by yourself . We can figure all of this out , everything on Leena 's list . We 'll--we 'll do it together , all of us . You know , Buddha says peace comes from within . Just might take a few lifetimes . Very comforting . Here . You might be a lifetime or two ahead of me . I 'll save you a seat in nirvana . [ Shimmering tone ] It says " indescribable beauty . " Well , that 's- - that 's more like it . Watch your head . Evan was right , you know ? About Ryan . Someone did call that tip to the FBI ten years ago . It was you . Why ? Ryan ... he changed . He had gotten so angry ... violent . He wanted to do something like this . Not just hit a place , but the people working in it . Said it was the only way we would get their attention . I couldn 't live with that , so I did the only thing I could think of . I turned him in . I loved him and I stuck a knife in him . You didn 't have a choice . You had to stop him . You had to save him . You asked me if had any regrets about the LPE . I should have been there for Ryan after he got arrested . He made it clear we should all stay away . I was young and scared , so I did what he asked . But he needed me . He needed all of us . [ Sighs ] [ Playing keyboard ] Oh , hi . Um ... Heard you got the snag in Oregon . That 's a good- - nice job . Uh , if you 're looking for Steve or Myka , they 're cleaning up in aisle- - aisle- - I did what I had to do . I know you did . That 's it . Not quite . Thank you . - That 's it . - [ Chuckles ] [ Keypad beeping ] [ Door opens ] [ Door closes ] As a Warehouse consultant , can you state , that under no duress , you accept and understand your responsibilities ? Yes , I can . And--and I do . And you understand the potential risks involved ? Yes . The world is a dangerous place . And I know the work that the Warehouse does , and ... I just want to be a part of that . Yes , I know that at any given time , my life might be at risk , but ... that 's a risk that I 'm willing to take to make this world a safer place . A better place . [ Beep ] I 'm sorry , Leena . I 'm so sorry .

CRAZY . - I 'VE BEEN LIVING IN THEIR HOME , LEARNING THEIR LANGUAGE , COOKING THEIR GROSS FOOD , AND THEY STILL TREAT ME LIKE AN OUTSIDER . BUT DATAK- - DATAK GETS TO ATONE . I JUST DON 'T GET THESE PEOPLE . - YOU CAN PRACTICE ALL THE RITUALS YOU WANT .

IT 'S JUST A LITTLE AWKWARD , GIVEN THAT I BARELY KNEW YOU . WAS IT SUPPOSED TO BE AN APOLOGY ? - IT WAS A GIFT . - MM. SCHOOLBOY CRUSH . LITTLE NILES 'S FIRST YEAR . SO SWEET . BUT YOU KNEW WE ALL LAUGHED AT YOU , RIGHT ? ALL THE SIXTH FORMERS . I MEAN , IT WAS SO OBVIOUS . - DID YOU LAUGH ? - YES , I DID . WHAT CAN I SAY ? I WAS 17 . I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY .

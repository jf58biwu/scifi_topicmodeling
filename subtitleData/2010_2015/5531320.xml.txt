 SSA : Wait for audio trigger The joint for the right arm is weak on this 96 . Just like the real thing . I 'm amazed at Banpure models . Shinji . Summer ! The beach ! And One summer One summer One summer The experience of the summer ... Why does it turn out like this ? Well , it is in the same district . Listen to me ! We were supposed to go to the beach in Kujyukiri ! Onjyuku ! The white beach ! The desert of the moon ! Camels ! There seems to be no security problems here . Stop messing around and come . It 's him . It 's his fault isn 't it ? If you didn 't like it so much , you didn 't have to come . Yeah , yeah , you should 've refused when Sagara agreed to go with Kazama . You 're a high school student though , you shouldn 't ditch your friends just because you 're a little uncomfortable . This might be more exciting than the beach . Maybe some handsome BS pilot will come up to you and go ... Want to BS with me ? What if something like that happened ? You mean AS right ? We will avenge our loss from the Chuuton festival . The team that challenged us is named the Red Dragons , but it is full of stupid fools . We 'll show them hell . I wish you all a good fight . That is all Board the mechs . Yeah ! This is prime grade Nerima daikon . Here ... Why don 't you try it out ? The training demonstration by the soldiers is about to begin . Be sure to watch everyone . Man , you look ridiculous . This is cardboard . The real ones look cool . You 're going to lose again this year right ? Let 's go . Yeah . Jeez , even the little kids make fun of them . The AS troop is weak as hell . Do they have a problem with their equipment ? No , they have the best equipment in the army . Then why are they weak ? All they have is good equipment , nothing else . Shinji . Dad . You are Sagara ? Yes . I 'm Sergeant Sagara . I mean , nice to meet you . I 'm Kazama Shintaro . I 'm the commander here . This is the first time that Shinji has brought a friend along to this festival . You don 't need to say useless things . I mean , he 's a boy like this . Sometimes I get worried . Dad , quit it . Please , do have a good time today . Yes . Commander ! An unusual boy . He 's formal , almost like a man in the military . He 's pretty skillful . I should have gotten it without the aonori . If it gets on my teeth , it 'll be harder to pick up men . Kana-chan , want some ? Hey . Where are you girls from ? Yes From Sengawa . What a coincidence . I 'm from Nerima . Sengawa is very close by . Who is this ? Yep , almost the same city . He 's sort of scary . If you don 't mind , want to AS with me ? What ? I 'll show you the magnificence of the Nerima Red Dragons . Nerima daikon ? No ! Nerima Red Dragons , the Red Dragons . How about it ? Of course . I want to ride . My name is Akagi Ryunosuke . You are ? I don 't really like AS 's And also people who are crazy about them . No need to worry . I 'll teach you everything if you know what I mean . No thank you . Wow , what a graceful way to get angry . Commander ... It 's time . Understood . Please excuse me . Damn it , he pisses me off . Why is it Kaname and not me ? I 'm not going to get my revenge . Why does it turn out like that ? Everyone seems down . Did something happen ? Shut up ! Let us begin today 's Chuuton festival 's main event . Various competitive games by the troops of the Nerima training grounds . Here they come . Akagi ! We 're going to win this year ! What are you joking about ? You guys are pathetic compared to the Nerima Red Dragons . Nerima daikon ... I won 't forgive him . We 'll finish it in one blow . Right grip , full power . Right , full power . Ready . Go ! Wow , Nerima team is strong again this year . More like Narashino is too weak ? I told you . They are weak . Damn , still weak ? Narashino is staying very close . This year , it 's down to the anchor . Increase power . We can 't go any faster than this . You are weak . Take off the limiter . Removing ! A strong hit . Nerima wins again . Nerima , you 're dirty . Kazama . The opponent is a tandem . They have a slight difference in their synchronization . That will be our chance . We 're on a tandem too . Get ready for a smash . Roger . Sir , they 're coming . Their drive smash . What ? ! It 's a feint . Go forward . Pathetic . No ! Again ! Don 't play so dirty . It 's over . Everything . Sir . There 's an unmarked AS approaching . An AS with no name ? That 's impossible . This AS is going three time faster than it 's normal speed . What ? Damn . Wow ! Hey where did Sagara-kun go ? It can 't be . Listen to me Nerima Daikon . It 's Nerima Red Dragon ! This is supposed to be a friendly exhibition . It 's not war . Stop using dirty tricks . Step outside . That was a graceful smash . You , who are you ? I guess it doesn 't matter as long as you pilot an AS . Fine ! I challenge you ! Sousuke ! What the heck are you doing ? ! How did you find out my identity ? Only you would pull off something like THIS ! But since this is a friendly match , I wanted to teach them about fair play . Damn it ! I never should have come ! Give me back my fun time at the beach ! Here . It must be hot in the GS . That stands for Group Sounds . That joke is so old . Mizuki , what are you doing ? Stop messing with a kid like that ... And GS with me . Although you 're wearing a costume , you must be really handsome inside . Come on , take these off and show me your face . You 're being rude to the AS pilot . Let 's go ! Good luck . Kana-chan . So her name is Kaname . It 's so graceful . Kaname-san . Kaname-san ! According to the judges , the ping pong match held earlier will be declared a draw due to outside interferences . Dad . I didn 't know a superb pilot like you would be in Narashino . I know it 's sudden , but I have a favor to ask of you . So that 's how it is . We have nowhere to run . Commander . Kosuge , why are you hiding this from me ? You didn 't tell me about and awesome pilot like him . I beg of you . We have to win against Nerima . Please take command of the forces . What are you doing Dad ? Kazama . Why do you lower yourself like that ? It 's because you were no good at piloting an AS , so you had to resort to this position . That 's all you could do right ? Is that true ? He has no sense of piloting whatsoever . You know why I began to read AS-fan ? I wanted to make sure . Is piloting an AS that hard ? Why can 't my father do it ? I wanted you to pilot an AS . I wanted to say my dad is an AS pilot . Shinji . I hate you Dad ! I 'm sorry . But ... You are forgetting something very important . What ? On the battlefield , reinforcements are very important , and necessary . Without backup , the men in the front lines cannot perform to their full potential . The one , who commands those reinforcements , is your father . Well then ... Let 's grate that piece of Nerima daikon . Yeah ! Did you have a fight with your boyfriend ? He 's not my boyfriend . So I still have a chance . Do you want to challenge him with me ? What ? By fighting him just once , I can already tell that he is a very skillful AS pilot . However , if I 'm with you I won 't lose . I know I 'll win . I think this is a good time to AS with me . What do you think ? Can you win ? Of course . I 've never made a lady feel regret . Fine , I accept . Thank you for your patience . We will finally begin our last event , the kiba-sen . In this event , we will judge with special standards , the winner of this event takes all . Go ! Go ! Where did everyone go ? Who knows . Good luck , Mr. BS pilot . I won 't ask you anything about your background . Let 's do our best . I thank you . Since we put Kazama and his son on one of the machines , we cannot lose , or they will be blamed . We must win . Inexperienced moves by inexperienced pilots can sometimes lead to astonishing results . Let 's go . Why does it smell in here ? You won 't be worrying about that soon . Just like you do in P.E. class . I 'll follow you . Don 't touch me . We are about to begin the kiba-sen . It used to be like that . But recently , things haven 't been going well for them . The other day , they had an argument like the one earlier . And his son broke one of his precious models . They 're teamwork is horrible right now . Teamwork is something that is forged on the battlefield . We won 't know until we fight . Ready ? Why am I Dad . I 'll pilot . What are you saying ? You can 't possibly . My friend told me to use this . What are we going to do ? WHAT are we going to do ? It 's simple . Just throw out your punches like you want to hit someone . Fine . Here we go . Shinji ! Load . Wow ... This AS is awesome . They evaded . It 's fine . You have a good feel for the AS . One more time . I do ? Alright then . That commander AS . He 's not moving like usual . Kaname-san , HE must be using that AS . Ok . Damn . We can 't take their commander AS lightly . He is very skillful . He is ? It seems his punch timings are different from usual . Troops C , troops D. Cover the Kazama B team . C team , acknowledged . D team , acknowledged . What are we going to do ? This is the point of our plans . If we take out the head of the dragon , we have a chance to win . This is turning out to be more exciting than I thought . Acknowledged . They 're coming . St ... stop it ! Don 't worry . We 're going to take their commander AS now . What ? Team B , team C. We 're going to do the usual . They 're coming . It 's the Red Stream Attack . What ? Using the AS 's as a ramp ? ! Down by low . We lose to that every year . Jumping all that weight . Timing , jump ability , and guts they have it all . This feels great . It 'll feel even better when you defeat the enemy . Don 't get close to me though . Dad , the turning on the right side is slow . I can 't do anything about that . Please fall back . We 'll stop them here . What are you saying ? I can 't just leave you guys . I 'm always fighting , even if I 'm not in an AS . I 'm still part of the team ! Narashino team is in a pinch ! Are the Red Dragons going to win as predicted ? Commander , I bid you good luck . Please show them the spirit of our ... Shinji I 'm not very skilled . I can 't even fix models that well . But ... I can 't just retreat like this . I know . Will you fight together with me ? Yeah . I will . Ok . We 're going to win . Message to the remaining fighters . We 're going to grate that Nerima piece of daikon . Dad ! Everyone forward . Begin counterattack ! Yeah ! Shinji , ready the left counter . Left counter , acknowledged . What 's going on ? I told you . Teamwork is forged on teh battle field . Hey , we 're losing . What 's going on ? Narashino is coming back . They 're fighting back and getting even . We 're going to take their commander AS . Everyone , ready ? Roger . One more time , the radish jump ? It 's the Red Stream Attack . Here they come . Our down by low won 't make it in time . We 're not going to make it . The 96 's have a weak right joint . Shinji , go for the right arm joint . What ? Understood . The arm came off . What ? ! Now ! Roger ! Go to hell ! We 're going to win this year ! Game set ! Surprisingly , Narashino wins ! It 's like a dream . Thank you . No ... You guys just performed at your full potential , that 's all . Dad . We did it . We won . Get away from me . The match is over . I don 't want to admit it but my immaturity made me blind . You 're annoying . I found out today how important my father 's job really is . Thanks Sagara-kun . We were able to win because of you . It wasn 't because of me . It was because of your father , and the Narashino troops . Me . BS pilot ... My ... Where are my summer memories ?

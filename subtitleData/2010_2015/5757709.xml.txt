 JANE : Previously on Warehouse 13 ... You are allowed to reveal the true nature of our work to one person . I was insubordinate . I drew my gun on Mrs. Frederic , and she fired me . MRS. FREDERIC : We answer to a higher authority . ARTIE : These are the Regents ? ( SCREAMING ) Philip ! You are the Guardian now . Hey , I want you to meet my partner . Mom . PETE : You can 't be a Regent , okay ? You 're my mom . My mom can 't be a Regent . How can my mom be a Regent and not have told me ? I 'm sorry , Pete , just calm down and let me explain . Okay , fine . Explain . Explain why you didn 't tell me . I wanted to tell you , Pete , but I ... But you didn 't , so I went on living my life on some kind of need-to-know basis . No , it wasn 't like that . It was a lot more complicated . Peter , please sit down . I can 't concentrate ... Fine . I 'm sorry , darling . I will explain it all . Just let me start at the beginning . MRS. FREDERIC : Some other time , Jane . A time when the Warehouse isn 't under attack , and someone isn 't trying to kill you . Arthur 's researching the company that funded your mercenary . A to Z Technologies . We are not equipped for military action , yet it would seem we are at war . A to Z Technologies . There 's something about that name . I have a very bad feeling about it . You what ? You what ? You have a feeling , you mean , like my kind of feeling ? You get vibes , too ? Oh , jeez , Louise , do I know anything about you at all ? Peter , please . Okay , just ... ( CLEARS THROAT ) Just tell me this . If the Regents hadn 't been attacked , would you or you have ever told me ? Yeah . That 's what I thought . He needs time , Irene . We don 't have any time , Jane . Jason , I 'm just running to the store . Oh , don 't forget to stop at the drycleaners . Okay . I 'll be back in an hour . MAN : What was that ? ( INDISTINCT ) ( ENGINE SPUTTERING ) Jason , the car won 't start . Jason ? Jason ? CLAUDIA : No , I 'm not going to leave it alone because you still haven 't answered my question , Artie . Why did you fire Steve ? Look , someone is picking off the Regents one by one . We just can 't sit here and do nothing . I didn 't , I didn 't fire Steve , Mrs. Frederic did . And we are not doing nothing . Leena and I are fortifying the Warehouse , and Regent Security is investigating . There 's obviously more to this than you 're telling me . Regent Security ? ( BOTH ARGUING ) Enough ! Let this go , both of you . We have a ping . A man in Portland , he vanished from his driveway yesterday , in a brilliant flash of light . And I am sending the two of you . We can 't work a case right now . A ping ? ( BOTH ARGUING ) Silence ! This is not snag , bag and nag ! When I say go , you go ! Now ! March ! Not you . ( WHIMPERS ) Stay . Go back to your bed . Yes . See ? Why can 't they all be like you ? Hey . You , uh , want to talk ? I know how hard it must be for you to find out about your mom like that . I ... ( EXHALES ) I can 't imagine it if was me . Well ... You might feel like an idiot , and you might feel like you never really knew your own mother . She 's your mom , Pete . Of course , you know her . I mean , I even know her a little bit . We did survive a crumbling building together . ( CHUCKLES ) And I think that she 's a brave , strong , amazing woman who loves you very much . Then why wouldn 't she tell me ? I mean , I 'm a Warehouse agent . It 's not like I 'm not in on the secret . I don 't know , but she had to have her reasons , right ? Maybe she was trying to protect you . Oh , right . Or maybe my whole life 's been one big lie . I 'm some pawn to the Regents and Mrs. Frederic . Ever since I found out that Sam was killed because of an artifact , I 've started to wonder if we all are . But I 've also started to wonder if it matters . It matters . Are you happy ? That 's not the point , Myka . Because I think you are . And what difference does it make if it 's a part of a master plan , or if it 's just dumb luck ? It makes a difference to me . JANE : I 've lied to him . Violated his trust . What kind of mother does that ? A good one . It 's not easy for us , doing what we do . We keep so many secrets , even from our own children . It 's different for you , Irene . Your son isn 't an agent . You knew I didn 't want this for Pete . I was always afraid something like this would happen . You went against my wishes . Jane , he belongs here . You know he does . You raised him for this without even realizing it . He 'll come around . But right now , I need for you to concentrate on A to Z Technologies . I am trying . If I could just somehow dig out that memory . Of course . Why didn 't I think of that ? Come with me . Okay , so according to Mrs. Kinser , her husband was standing right there when he disappeared in a big flash of light . Anything else ? Clap of thunder ? Poof of smoke ? No . No smoke , but she did say that after the flash , her car battery died , the porch lights blew , and the power around the entire block went out for a few seconds . Okay , so what ? Something magnetic ? Maybe . That draws its energy from the power sources around it . Okay . I 'll call Artie and see if anything pops . Could you do it from the car ? I want to check out that T-shirt shop that Kinser ran downtown . Yeah . Okay . VIOLA : Alien abduction . It all fits . The flash of light was the aliens transporting Mr. Kinser to their ship , and the power outage was caused by the surge from their engine boosters . Well , that 's a theory . MYKA : Um , Viola , right ? Are you the manager ? I 'm the manager . Come on in . Oh , God , Jeff . None of this , none of that . More glitter on that . Wow . Looks like glitter 's making a comeback . So Stan says . Thanks to him , I have found it everywhere . ( CHUCKLES ) You know , I even found some in my va-jay-jay . STAN : Viola ! Kinser laid off half the staff , but I 'm the reason these guys are so efficient . Kinser fired a lot of good artists , and he wasn 't particularly nice about it . Jeff McMasters , director of design . So , Kinser was tough to work for , huh ? Ugh , he was very businessy . That 's probably why the aliens wanted him . JEFF : Jason Kinser only cared about the bottom line . He had no respect for the art or the artist . Was there anyone who was particularly upset about the layoffs ? Anyone probably more upset than the others ? They were all pretty postal . Okay , well , we 're going to need a list of names . We have to talk to the rest of the employees . Do you think that some of the people Kinser fired were body snatched ? Maybe . Hey , it 's Brandon . Buzz me in . Look , let me in , will you ? Look , I 'm not mad , all right ? I think I deserve an explanation , though . I want to talk face-to-face , all right ? What the hell ? Look , I know you 're up there . I can see you . I 'm not leaving until you come down and talk to me . Come on ! Come on ! ARTIE : We have another disappearance . There was a second random power outage earlier today . I cross referenced with missing-person reports . A computer programmer called the cops and said his roommate went missing around the same time . And so far , there 's no connection between him and our first victim , Jason Kinser . Probably because the connection 's on the alien ship . What ? Nothing . Don 't worry , we 're on it . There has to be other ways . Less risky ways . Travel back in your memories and watch them ? Oh , yes , hundreds . You 're joking , right ? I 'm very dry . I understand your concern , Agent Nielsen , and I appreciate it , but someone out there is targeting Regents , and so far , we have nothing . We have A to Z Technologies . That information is buried deeply in Jane 's memory , unless you 've unearthed some answers A to Z Tech is a shell company within a shell company , within another shell company , but I 've managed to trace it to the Cayman Islands , where I have a contact who could , if he 's still alive ... He could possibly ... Okay , fine . But you understand the dangers ? You could get lost in your own memories , and you could wind up trapped there forever . A chance I 'm willing to take . But you won 't have to take it alone . The artifact 's dangers can be diminished if there 's another person present . Someone to ground you , to pull you back if need be . Which is why I 'm going with you . No . I want to go . Into my memories ? Well , it 's my life , too . At least , I thought it was . ( SIGHS ) You each touch one of the shoes . Jane , concentrate on what you want to see . Focus on your question . A to Z Technologies . MRS. FREDERIC : Precisely . The shoe will walk your subconscious to the specific memory you 're seeking . Keep in mind that you 'll be observers only . You won 't be able to interact with anyone . You won 't be able to change the past . What 's so dangerous , then ? Going back through old memories , sometimes the urge to stay is overwhelming . And that would result in a permanent split . That 's why you have to be there to pull her back . ( SIGHS ) We don 't want our energies to interfere , but we 'll be close by . ( SHATTERING ) Mom ... It 's the house . We 're really at the house . Hey , it 's my BMX bike ! Wrecked it when I was 13 . Doug Beam and I made that ramp . Oh , my God , Doug Beam . I wonder what he 's doing now . I can 't believe it . It 's exactly the same . This doesn 't have anything to do with A to Z Technologies . I shouldn 't have let you come . This isn 't where I 'm supposed to be . Yeah , well , maybe it 's where I 'm supposed to be . I 'm going to go see Dad . Oh , no , it 's not this day . ( GASPS ) Pete , wait ! ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) I 'm so sorry , Pete . TOM : I know something 's wrong because we were supposed to meet at the David Lynch Festival , and Brandon never misses David Lynch . Do you know where he was before you were supposed to meet him ? Yeah . He was picking this girl up that he 's been dating . It 's pretty serious . It was the third date . He was going to turn her onto Eraserhead . Anyway , I tried calling her . She didn 't pick up , either . Do you know this girl ? No , but I 've heard about her . A lot about her . And by a lot , you mean ? She 's got golden hair that smells like grapefruits , these sexy , spooky Lolita eyes , this rocking bod that makes you just want to ... A lot . Got it . You get a name with that vivid description ? Megan . Megan Reese . I know that name . That name , I think is on the list of former employees . Megan Reese used to work for Jason Kinser . Dots now have been connected . CLAUDIA : So , I guess the landlady didn 't see anything , but she definitely heard Brandon out here , caterwauling the other day . Caterwauling ? Yeah . Her word . Not mine . I like the way it rolls off the tongue , though . ( CHUCKLES ) The neighbors reported that there was a power outage right about the same time that Brandon would have disappeared . And that 's Megan 's apartment , right ? Ugh ! What do you want to bet we find her dead mother in a rocking chair up there ? Oh , I think I like the alien idea better . Claudia . What is it ? I don 't know , but it looks ... Familiar . Mrs. Kinser reported that there was a flash of light , her porch lights blew , and her car battery died , right ? It could have been caused by something like an electromagnetic pulse . I 've seen this before in photos of the aftermath of Hiroshima . There were impressions , almost shadows , of the victims that were left after the bombs fell . But Jason Kinser was in his yard , so there was no place to see a shadow . Right . Are we saying that whatever happened to Brandon might ... Might be something nuclear . LANDLADY : Oh , Megan Reese . Late with her rent . Won 't come out , won 't let me in . I can 't even get the handyman in there to fix the pipes . Can 't say I 'm sorry you 're here . This looks like a good a time as any to tell her to pack up her things and skedaddle . Ma 'am , now might not be the best time . Come on , Rapunzel , open up ! You 're in a truckload of trouble . MEGAN : Go away , leave me alone . See ? See that ? You 're this close to eviction , missy . MEGAN : Get away from here . Get away from the door . Hey , it 's my door . Ma 'am , leave . Now . Megan , Secret Service . Open up . MEGAN : Go away , please . Just go away . I can 't do that , Megan . Open the door . MEGAN : No ! Go away before it 's too late . If you don 't , I 'll have to kill you , too , just like the others . I warned you , and now , you 're going to die . Watch out ! ( GASPS ) ( GASPS ) MYKA : Okay , Megan . All right , it 's okay . We 're gonna put these away . All right ? Myka , what are you doing ? We 're still here . No one died . Yet . Megan , just give us the artifact . What are you talking about ? The object you 're using to kill people , whatever it is . There 's no object . It 's me . Every time I get upset , people explode . I 'm cursed , I 'm a monster . You 're not a monster . Just go away , please . Don 't you understand ? I am going to kill you . Please ! Myka ! Okay , okay , look . Just calm down , all right ? We 're stepping away . It 's okay . ( GASPS ) Myka , what the frak ? She doesn 't want to hurt us , Claudia . She doesn 't even know what the artifact is . Artifact is unconscious ? She 's not in control of it . Well , yeah , but you heard her . People get whammied whenever she gets upset . And if you hadn 't noticed , our being here is making her very upset . Right , so we 'll just figure out whatever the artifact is . Without getting flash fried ? Oh , fun . Claudia , look , the girl is in trouble . Fine , but if her hair starts blowing around like Firestarter , we 're out of here . You still need to eat . Oh , God . My Jeannie . Can I get you something ? ( INAUDIBLE ) She can 't see us , can she ? I won 't go through this again . PETE : Mom . Mom , look at you . PETE : It 'll get better , Pete . It will . Lattimer . Even Ralph Brunsky was nice to me that day . Mrs. Frederic . Hey , what are you doing here ? I thought this was only a two passenger ... Mrs. Frederic was here ? She knew me my whole life ? MRS. FREDERIC : Jane , I 'm so sorry . We all are . What ? Tell me . It wasn 't a fire ? An artifact killed him ? No , there was no artifact . He was a firefighter . A very brave one . Then why are you here ? To extend our condolences . And to ask you to come back . The Warehouse needs you . There 's a situation right here in town that ... No . No . Thank you for coming , Irene . God , I wish I could laugh like that again . Listen , whatever this is , the freakness , it can mess you up , but believe me , there is a way back , and we 're going to find it . What makes you so sure ? Because I 've been there . I doubt it . You 'd be surprised . There 's nothing . Megan , when did this start ? ( EXHALES ) A couple months ago , back in Indiana . I got mugged . This guy grabbed me . I got away . ( GRUNTS ) And then , all the lights just blew out . He was gone . Then it happened to my boyfriend . We got in this big fight . He shoved me . And I got mad , and then ... I came here so I could get away from it . But you couldn 't . I did . I did . It was okay . ( SOBBING ) I got a new job at the T-shirt shop , and I met Brandon . But then , this woman rear-ended me . And she was yelling ... And then ... My boss fired me for being late . And then , Brandon got mad at me . Come on ! What am I ... What am I going to do ? Megan , Megan , keep it together . Don 't meltdown . The yearbook . It 's the yearbook . Megan . Bag it ! Don 't suppose you 've seen any aliens , have you ? ( MYKA EXHALES ) There is no such thing as just a Regent . Your instincts have provided an invaluable perspective . Stop . I left all that behind when I had children of my own . It 's going to change now ? ( STUTTERS ) So , did Dad know ? Of course . He was my one . Of all the days to come here . I wouldn 't have , but we 're facing a difficult decision . The kind you 've always been helpful with . Warehouses have gotten along just fine without me for a millennia . No , it 's with people like you . Jane , we need your particular expertise . There 's a child . At least , consider it . I 'll be in touch . PETE : Wow . So , not just a Regent , but a Super Regent . Man , if I 'd have known , I 'd have gotten you a mug that said , " World 's Greatest Secret Overlord . " ( GLASS SHATTERING ) YOUNG PETE : Mom ! You 'd just break it like all the others . Maybe ... Maybe the artifact isn 't here . It 's me . People are dying around me . I 'm the problem . Wait a minute . No , no , no , no . You were nowhere near your boss when he died . Right , when your boss disappeared , you were here . Could she have contacted an artifact elsewhere , and still be affected by it ? The T-shirt shop . That 's the only thing that makes sense . We need to go there , and you have to come with us . Oh . No , I 'm not leaving here . Oh , no , you could be a big help . You know , maybe something about being there could spark some ... Oh , wow . Bad choice of words . Anyway ... Stop right there . Where do you think you 're going ? Not good . MYKA : Ma 'am , go back inside . Keep her away from me . Go back inside . Me away from you ? You 're two weeks late on your ... Ma 'am , go back inside for your own protection . Don 't talk to me that way . Keep her away from me . I know my rights . Don 't make me angry ! I 'm throwing you out ! Ah ! I killed her ! No , Megan . I killed her ! No , no , no , no , Megan ! Claudia , wait ! In this state , she could kill us both . What ? The angle of the shadow . I mean , the flash must 've come from that direction to cast a shadow on the sign this way , but Megan was standing over there . So , artifact thataway . You try and find Megan , talk her down . I 'm going to check this out . Yeah , you got it . PETE : Oh , my God . I remember this . Oh , you couldn 't possibly know . Wait , wait , wait , wait . Wait for it . Yo , Mom , watch this . ( SNIFFING ) ( LAUGHS ) ( LAUGHING ) Now , that was my best move , and I got nothing out of you , nothing . You did it a lot . Changing grape juice to milk doesn 't make it new . I was trying to cheer you up . ( PHONE RINGING ) Hello ? MRS. FREDERIC : Jane , have you had time to consider our invitation ? The matter I mentioned needs to be resolved rather quickly . Who 's that ? No one , sweetheart . Eat your lunch . Tell me more . You were taking secret Regent calls in front of me ? YOUNG JANE : All right , I 'm on my way . You 're going to have to finish lunch without me , Petey . I 'll be back in time to make dinner . Why ? Where you going ? It 's a gorgeous day . Call Ralph Brunsky . WALTER 'S MOM : Walter , lunch in 10 minutes . WALTER : Okay . Some swing . Thanks . Must be the star of your team . I guess so . Coach says I could even go pro someday . But Coach says stuff like that a lot . Sound like a practical man . What else you interested in ? Got any hobbies ? Do I know you ? Do you live around here ? Just taking a walk . Here you go . ( EXHALES ) Well , that looked important . Pete , you know better than anyone the delicate nature of dealing with artifacts . ( SCOFFS ) There 's always a downside . That boy had an ability he shouldn 't have . Taking it away was a heart-wrenching decision . What 's the big deal ? The kid wouldn 't go pro . Was it really worth lying to us ? You know the truth now . What does it matter now ? I was 12 years old , and all I knew then was that you were keeping secrets , and I felt left out . We all have things we have to do . And I had to do this . You know I couldn 't tell you . No , I don 't know . After Dad died , I ... Why couldn 't I have been your one ? So , I asked myself where would I run to in the middle of the city if I wanted to get as far away as possible from anyone I could hurt . I keep telling you we 're a lot alike . You vaporize people with your mind a lot , do you ? I definitely have the " Make people disappear " curse . I recently lost a really good friend . Uh ... He didn 't , like , die or anything , but he 's just gone . Not exactly the same . I have a boyfriend in the Witness Protection Program . Impressive , but still ... My brother disappeared into an inter-dimensional bubble . What ? Took me 12 years to get him back . Fine , you 're cursed , too . Congratulations . Thank you . Maybe we should start a support group . Called the " Arm 's Length Club . " I don 't think so . The " Ten Foot Pole Society . " Nice . Better . Sorry , I 'm ... It 's been a while since I could just talk to someone . Claud , did you find Megan ? Safe and sound . We 're bonding over our ability to repel people . Well , I don 't think Megan 's causing this . Somehow , this thing can shoot radiation from a distance . Listen , I 'm on the roof , and I found glitter up here . So , it 's probably somebody from the T-shirt shop . But it happened here in Portland , and back in Indiana . Well , then they had to follow you . The yearbook . MYKA : Ha ! Hey , Claud , look . Jeff McMasters . Okay , we interviewed him at the shop . Megan , he went to school with you . I hardly knew that kid . MYKA : Look , Megan he 's in a lot of your pictures . And he 's staring at you . Looks like you have a stalker . Megan , if this guy is willing to kill for you , then , your life is in danger , too . The way that the stalker mentality works , you probably had some kind of exchange with him in high school . Something that meant nothing to you , but that meant the world to him . Ever since , he 's been fixated on you . And now he has an artifact , and he 's using it to kill whoever he thinks is a threat to you . He probably thinks he 's doing it to protect you . Protect me ? He 's killing people and wrecking my life . And we 're going to make him stop . But first , we need to find whatever it is that he 's using , and to do that , well , we 're going to need your help . PETE : It 's Artie and MacPherson before he went all Dark Lord , I guess . We 've changed that boy 's life forever . No , we returned it to its natural course . I only hope we did it in time . The downside of that artifact would have been far worse than its upside . Okay , so if being a Regent is that hard , how did Mrs. Frederic convince you to go back ? She didn 't . ( GRUNTING ) JANE : Your father did . You ever see a dead body ? Now why do you want to go and ask that ? You did . Is it cool ? It really isn 't . Any of the guys you ever worked with died ? Well , um , yeah . It happens . I don 't think I want you to be a firefighter anymore . Pete , you 're a big man , and I never want to lie to you . It 's a dangerous job , and sometimes , bad things happen . Sometimes things happen that I 'm not going to want to talk about . Because they 're gross . And it isn 't the fun kind of gross like you think . But what I 'm doing out there , I 'm doing it for you . I 'm doing it for your sister , your mom . Because if me and guys like me don 't do this job , the whole town could burn down . Guys like me make a choice , Pete . To be the ones to keep the world safe . Even if that means it takes us away from the ones we love . But it 's because of that love that we do it . I want to be that kind of guy , too . ( CHUCKLES ) You are that kind of guy . All right , one more . We should go now . ( GRUNTING ) No , no . I want to stay a while . Peter , it 's time to go . ( SHATTERING ) Mom ... Pete , it 's all right . No , look , Mom , when I found out about this , I guess I thought being a Regent was more important to you than I was . I was a Regent because nothing is more important to me than you are . You and your sister . And I had nothing to do with you becoming an agent , either . You did that . I was against it . Wait . What , why ? Nothing , never mind . Mom , I want to know . You were always taking unnecessary risks . Oh , my God . This is like when I asked if I could out for football ... And I wasn 't going to facilitate your impulsive ... ( BOTH ARGUING ) Hi , Jeff . It 's Megan . I know . Believe me , I know . I was starting to wonder if you remembered my name . What ? Yes , I do . Well , it 's just you haven 't said anything since that time you got Murphy and his morons to leave me alone . On that field trip . Field trip . Right . So , that 's why you 've been protecting me . I thought after you had a reason to stay away . So I followed your lead . I hope I did the right thing . Sure . You did just right . It 's so cool to finally be talking like this . To talk to you at all . How are you doing it , Jeff ? I mean , how are you making people just go away ? Come here . When I found these , I knew it was a sign . Why are you talking to me now ? What are you looking at ? Jeff , listen to me . Just put down the bag . We 're not going to hurt you . JEFF : You lied to me ! No , I didn 't . No , I didn 't lie . You don 't remember anything . I remember . After all I 've done for you , you bring them here ? ( SHRIEKING ) No , Megan ! Megan ! Come on . After all this time . All those secret glances you gave me . What , you decided you 're done with me now ? Stop it ! The artifact 's in his bag . So keep your eyes out for it . Legitimate question . If he 's toting a radiation shooting artifact do we risk our Teslas ? Jeff ? Listen , nobody else needs to get hurt . We can find a way out of this . Myka ! Stay away ! This is between me and her ! CLAUDIA : Myka , look out ! ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTS ) Hey . ( GASPS ) He 's coming . You 're going to pay for having lied to me , Megan ! And your friends are going to pay , too ! All the doors are locked ! You can 't get out ! ( GRUNTING ) I told you to stay away . You want me , Jeff ? I 'm right here . I loved you , Megan . ( SCREAMS ) ( MYKA GRUNTING ) You okay ? Yeah . Hey , you did good . ( EXHALES ) The binoculars belonged to the pilot of the plane that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima . He saw the blast through them , and they absorbed the horror of that moment . So when Jeff found them and looked through them , all his emotions , his rage , just set them off . So you were never actually cursed . I 'm guessing you weren 't really cursed , either . Now , see , that 's just crazy talk , because I 'm so totally cursed . Right ? ( LAUGHING ) Look , thanks . For everything . I hope you hear back from your best friend . Bye . Bye , Megan . I 'm going to make a call . Claud ? Yeah ? Say hi for me . Mmm-hmm . ( SIGHS ) PETE : Well , it 's like when you wouldn 't let me grate the celery for the Thanksgiving stuffing . And we were nibbling on fingers as a result . Bad example . Uh , did you find anything ? I did , but I may have messed up what Mom was looking for . Don 't be so sure . Artie , where is Collodi 's Bracelet shelved ? Collodi 's Bracelet ? Collodi ... ( STUTTERS ) James and I bagged that , what , 30 years ago ? I know . You were so cute . Carlo Collodi wrote the original story of Pinocchio . For the most part he was an angry , bitter satirist . In the original , when the little cricket tries to tell Pinocchio what to do , he flattens him with a hammer . Here . It was made out of the strings of a marionette that belonged to Collodi . It fell into the hands of a young boy . Named Walt Sykes . MRS. FREDERIC : The bracelet gave him control of his own body , enabling him to walk . But it would have planted a seed of darkness in his soul . JANE : Aztec . A to Z Technologies . That 's what I was remembering . That young boy is now the man who is attacking us . Walter Sykes . The Guardian that now wears the shackle is under watch 24l7 . I don 't see any way to get to her . No need to . Jane Lattimer and I are going to be getting together very soon . I 'm looking forward to it . And meeting her son . There 's one more road I need you to go down , Marcus . Steve Jinks . Stukowski was right . He 's vulnerable . Yeah . Find a way to get to him . Yes , sir . Could you get that book over there for me , Marcus ? Oh , that 's Lok Archer . Used to be a Regent . He isn 't , anymore . His last act was quite helpful to us . Recently , I 've come across some useful information . Not destroying the shackle was disappointing . But fortunately , there 's another way .

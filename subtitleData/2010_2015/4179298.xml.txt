This is an exercise , right ? - No , they share people , there must be something . Great , the guy comes from the Navy . And now we are to him . Do you have tortelini 's ?

We heard that the army is coming . - That 's us . An army for the meteor shower . - Of those still to come . A meteorite hit the ocean , There are many black smoke plumes from . Visibility is less . These things were undetectable until they entered our atmosphere . NASA says they are not water Getting to terminal velocity . They slow down before impact . These objects are small clusters in the ocean . 16 km from a large populated area . The thermal images of the Hubble telescope show that ... each cluster in the middle object is larger than the rest . All these items have middle same geometrical shape . They seem mechanical ones . This is not a meteor shower , Marines . We are in danger code Delta . Indeed . All units pack up and go . Combat situation . - As I trained for . I just heard that the Coast Guard a Mayday sent , it is hard to see . There is another bias , This is the closest so far . They go through it , two meteorites ... Information from the studio . Shut up . It seems like something ... I am looking for people who know what this is . There are figures , I 'm six maybe eight . What is that ? Everyone here should now be gone .

Do not fool around and keep your head . My dearest wife . We evacuate people quickly enough . All units warned . Some friends behind enemy lines . I first wanted to eat out . - Hold on , it gets rough . Hurry . See the smoke plumes . - Continue .

The Air Force Board Hawks and B52 on board . And throwing them at 19 : 30 hours the area Lincoln Boulevard to the ocean shelf . We throw Santa Monica flat ? - There is a plague from God knows what .

Official bodies are now saying that citizens within 16 km of the coast ... should try in a F.O.B. to come . A safer place can not . The army has set up a defense to protect civilians . We 'll take care of you . Look here for . Our trauma center is there , Mr. Rincon . - Thanks . Joe Rincon . - Staff Sergeant Nantz . This is my son Hector .

We 're sitting ducks . He came out of the house , they went him inside ... and they shot him right through his head . Have you any idea why they shot him down ? It 's not communicated . No demands or nothing . They are so obvious to our sources . If you invade a place for his sources ... then disable the people from that The rules of each settlement . And we are being colonized . Brave children . - They are my cousins . My sister and her husband were on vacation . They live in Arizona . I see them once or twice a year . Now I am perhaps the only they have left . Do you have children ? - No . Neither do I. I had always regretted , it 's the best .

I think I know a way out . - What ? 200 meters , since those back . A bus . - Lieutenant , there is one bus . Understood . The men on the roof saw a bus . I think he works . - We must walk towards it . It is miles to the base . About one hour , the bombs fall . We must be quick . - A bus is a good target . I 've decided . It is my responsibility . There is a bus seen . That we ought to get . Can one of you drive a bus ? - Stavrou , he is from Jersey . Ladies first . About 200 meters is a van . Behind . There is a problem . You must follow me . Harris has found . You must see it . It seems the weapon surgically There is turned on . Talk about dedication to the cause . Stavrou , hold it down firmly . Let me shoot .

They 're your men . Pull back , my ass . - That 's right . Who the hell is John Wayne ? Keep all your eyes open . Stay alert . Thanks for that . It was nothing .

It should be a great have control . If you do not agree Northcom was I would not be here . Why ? My mission was " AIS . " grant with ' one strike package . A strike package ? The coordinates of a missile attack on the control center . The bombers disappeared from the radar . We lost them . All streets are blocked . We can only take the highway . Well , your decision . - Stavrou , take us to the highway . I would not be here if the bombs fall . Try to avoid at least one car . Drive through . Another 1.5 km to Holframe .

They come closer . Here we go . This is Lieutenant William Martinez . Echo Company , 2nd Battalion , 5th Marines . We are still half a kilometer within the blast zone . Keep moving , to survive , marines . He showed the lieutenant there now die ? There would appear so . And he must lead us ? Come on . Those are our planes . We 're still fighting . We are still in the blast zone . We conclude it . The bombs fall over six minutes . Santos , see if there are telephones . Only hard wired . All safe ? - Safe . Do you have a landline ? - There . My son is an optimist . The first time he said , " Let them talk . Maybe they are friends . " We eat and drink for your father here . It 's okay . - What did you tell him ? I said , if they chase us and shooting at us ... are probably not good friends . I had to go to the base . I never had the police should stay , but I was scared . I have all the wrong decisions . You trusted your instincts . You had a decision . I would be the same do to protect my Marines . On my last mission I had the same situation . There was no escape . Whether you went right or left , it did not matter . But you live . - Yes , I survived . That was not the intention . Staff Sergeant Nantz ? Promises to save my son ? We have a solid connection . Keep warm . I 'll see what 's going on . This keeps you warm . Supposedly there are 20 cities in 17 countries attacked . It is clear that the enemy will cut us apart . Is there more information , Stavert professor ? The data show us that water as their fuel ... and the level of our ocean falls al They use it for their ships ... their machines . Possibly also their bodies . The composition of our water is unique . It is a liquid form . Nowhere in our Universe is H20 in the liquid surface . I just saw a report stating they use our sewer system ... to our water to their ship transport . How did you got that working ? - These things are everywhere . There 's one for each coast in 20 countries . They call it The " command control " . You who were chasing ? - Yes . This thing sends to the Drones . If we destroy We get down their air force . I hope that those bombs work . - Come on . How much time do we have ? One minute . The Air Force will extraterriotoriale bastards even deliver some pain . Retreat ? - Never ! Here we go . - We will burn the bastards . We go to the command center after the bombs have fallen . To get ammunition . - Gain . Tanks . Ten . - You must be strong . Eight , seven , six ... five , four , three ... get ready all . They should have covered . We would have felt if they had fallen ? - Then we would have felt . We had felt in Nevada with such force . State that clock right ? - That 's what I have . Maybe this is something good . Perhaps we have turned the tide . We have well kept house . - Have they turned off our entire Air Force ? This does not happen . Come on , everybody . Now we know why these bombs not fallen . They have destroyed our base . All safe , staff sergeant . Bring them back here . It was a small chance that we would come here , and now nothing . I knew that Nantz would not get us there . There were thousands of Marines here . - Now there are only seven . You make me think my older brother . How so ? - He never laughs . Make sure the front is secure . Imlay , is there anything ? - Only maps of Santa Monica . We must further east . Everything is burned . Follow me . This is the control battalions . We are looking maps , wherever there an extraction point . I 'll be back . I have found a tactical map . It says that all units were prepared . What are those red marks ? - That they are gone . Are those units moved ? - Disabled . All of them ? - All . There is an alternative extraction point operation . Eight kilometers . There are still plenty of weapons . Looking for an M16 . Mr. Rincon is dead . Rincon is dead ? Leave me . Leave me . I 'm so sorry , Hector . I 'm sorry . Your father has his best in order to stay with you . I would not be here . It 's all done , buddy . Your father was a brave man , Hector . Hector , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , buddy . Cry . He loved you very much . Listen to me , Hector . I want you 're brave for me , I want you my kidney are marinating . We 're going to be brave for the others . You know why ? Why ? Because Marines do not give up . Do you believe that ? Say that for me . Marines do not give up . - Good . I 'll get you out of here , I promise . Come on . We are not going to lose people , understood ? Get us out too ? Whether we are replaceable ? Lockett , if you want to go , then we go . I can handle it , man , and men died ... children , 18 years old , the best I had ever run . Do you think that I 'd rather not willing to trade with them instead ? I know you think my men have their deaths . They 're dead . And I 'm here . As a climax to a bad joke . You think I like this ? Not a minute goes by that those faces in my brains .

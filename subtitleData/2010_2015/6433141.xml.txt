 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... I know that ... Agent Coulson was killed in action . Welcome to level 7 . Some say it was only for 8 seconds , but I feel different . What is Centipede ? It 's an intravenous filter for his blood . Very similar to the serum Dr. Erskine developed in the ' 40s for the ... - Super soldiers . - Listen , Doctor , your product works . It appears the volatility in the serum has been neutralized . Who is the woman you referred to ? Some rich girl in a flower dress . We all have to do things that make us uncomfortable if we are ever to get our toy soldiers off the shelf . 1x10 - The Bridge That seat is taken . Perimeter breach , quad four ! Three guys just crashed the prison ! Security breach ! Security breach ! Time to go . Sir . Excuse me ? - Time to go , sir . - It 's time to go , sir ! sync correction by f1nc0 , chamallow web dl sync snarry - Mission briefing in 5 . - Okay . - Katherine Shane ? - Do you know her ? We ran a few ops together in the ' 90s . Smart , resourceful . Had a soft spot for Truffaut movies . Easy there , charm school . According to these files , Agent Shane could be my mom . Even if Shane was the agent who dropped you off at the orphanage , it doesn 't mean she 's your mother . I started looking into all the female agents active when I was born . Needle , haystack , I know . But then I factored in age and marital status , and then I built a program to narrow down the field . You 're still looking at a long road . Well , it would be a lot shorter if I could access more files . Maybe you could remove my internet nanny ? - I 'm talking about my tracking bracelet . - I got that . - So you 'll take it off . - No . But I asked May to look into S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s more restricted files . I was kind of hoping to keep this private . Agent May specializes in private . Let 's go . Nice feint . I read your file . I know you favor your left . That 's in there ? What else ? Nothing that 's news . You don 't play well with others . I think I 've proven that I can ... - ... more than once . - Not here . Towel down . I need you both in the command center in 5 . At 08-00 hours , three men infiltrated the Havenworth federal penitentiary . Infiltrated ? More like cannonballed . They were in and out in less then two minutes . Left no prints at the scene , but we do have one lead . Centipede . Seems they salvaged some of their research from Hong Kong . So we were right . Chan 's platelets solved their combustion problem . Now they can create super soldiers with no fear of explosion . Maybe don 't get so excited about it . Two of Centipede 's labs have been destroyed , but they keep popping back up . Now they have at least three of these guys , maybe more . Who did they break out ? Edison Po , former Marine , expert in tactics and rapid response . He fell off the grid in ' 08 , reappeared 18 months ago at a diner in Boston . Where he stabbed a friend 's eyes out . With a steak knife , then finished his meal . That 's funny . Po doesn 't look crazy . I 'm kidding . The guy is a walking mug shot . Which means he shouldn 't be too hard to track down . Finding Po and these Centipede soldiers is a top priority for S.H.I.E.L.D. We 'll be running point , but we won 't be working alone . What team did HQ send for backup ? Not a team ... a person , someone who can help us fight fire with fire . - Somebody we worked with before ? - Not exactly . Did I beat Captain America 's time ? Not even close . Excuse me . - Agent Coulson ? - Mr. Peterson , if you could put that bulldozer back where you found it ... we need you to suit up . This is a bad idea . While I have you in a good mood , you should know that Skye 's trying to I.D. the agent that dropped her off at the orphanage . We agreed to protect her from the truth , so I told her you were looking into it . She may come to you . One mistake at a time . Agent Coulson , Agent May . Last time you saw her , you threw her into a brick wall . Right . First time around , I wasn 't who I wanted to be , but now I get it . Having all this ... it 's a privilege . And training to be an agent , working with S.H.I.E.L.D. , it 's me trying to do better , trying to be better . I just need you to give me a shot . Everyone deserves a second chance . But let me be clear ... there will not be a third . - Understood , sir . - Good . It 's not good . At all . The guy was a ticking time bomb ... literally . HQ wouldn 't have sent him if he was still combustible . They must have found a way to stabilize him somehow . They stabilize his attitude ? 'Cause he was pretty hostile in Union Station . Well , it 's not like we haven 't opened up our doors to other people ... people with questionable track records . Not cool , but true . And don 't worry about Mike . He 's a good guy . Who 's been in the Centipede program . Exactly . He can give us some superpower backup . Yeah . Just saying , this could easily go sideways . I mean , the last time we saw this guy , he was a raging homicidal maniac ... He 's standing right behind me , isn 't he ? Mr. Peterson , this is Agent Grant Ward . He 's the man who shot you at Union Station . Fitz-Simmons designed the weapon he used , - and I think you remember ... - Kidnap victim . You joined S.H.I.E.L.D. ? Yeah . Turns out , guys in suits ... not so bad . Look , I know Union Station could have gone another way . Another team might not have let me out of there alive . I owe you ... all off you . That 's bygones and water under a distant bridge far away . - How 's your son ? - Still with my sister . He thinks I 'm working construction , but he 's good , happy . - So , what do we have ? - Not much on Po . I checked his previously known addresses and old military contacts ... came up empty . We 've been looking for where Po might be on the outside . Let 's look at his life on the inside ... at the prison . See if that gets us any leads . Anything on the Centipede soldiers ? We found a facial recog match on one of them . Name 's Brian Hayward . Stationed in Afghanistan for three years , then fell of the radar when he got back . Only living relative ... sister , Laura , Sophomore at the University of Ohio . She 's our best shot at finding Hayward . You and I will go talk to her . Have May set a course for Cleveland . With all the high-tech gadgets and gizmos at our disposal , it 's easy to forget about the simple tools of the past . What can I do for you ? I 'm just curious about what you want me to do , - where you need me . - Here , on the plane . But shouldn 't I be out in the field ? I mean , that 's why you brought me here , right ? You 'll get your chance . Right now I need you to go down to the lab for some tests . I 'm stable . They already tested me at Sci-Ops . I know . I also know that using your powers takes a toll . I need to understand your limits , for your sake as well as my team 's . The lab 's downstairs . I have to put away four times what I used to just to keep my energy up . And after you use your strength ? Maybe 10 times the food ? And I usually crash afterwards . - It 's really hard on my body . - Hard body . Got it . You do know we have equipment that can take measurements . - No need to do it manually . - My mistake . Well , no matter . I 'll send the numbers to you straight away . I need measurements to build you a diagnostic suit so we can monitor your vitals in the field . As for fabrics , how does a polymer blend with 10 layers of treated composite material sound ? - Sounds great ? - Yeah , it does , doesn 't it ? Sorry . I 'm sorry . I was ... I was just looking at it , and ... Oh , no , it 's okay . I 'm used to it . They tried to take it off me at the Sci-Ops facility . Realized they couldn 't do it without killing me . I 'm afraid we 're terribly curious . How did they stabilize the Extremis in you ? - And keep you from exploding ? - Yeah . Oh , that wasn 't them . That was you two . - Come again ? - What 's that ? Your gun . It somehow froze me right at the moment I was about to explode , helped my body absorb the serum , stabilize . - Your weapon saved my life . - Well ... All that , and it didn 't even leave a scar , so ... - Well , I ... - Well , I should think not . Yeah , we couldn 't have that , could we ? It would be a shame , especially when you 're so , well , formed and symmetrical . And wh ... when did you stop talking ? About three embarrassing sentences ago . Yes , right . " Psychology of women : Unraveling the female psyche . " That 's an actual book ? It 's a whole course . Hayward 's sister 's in there now . We 'll be at the school in 10 . We 'll catch her on her way out . Whole class ... on women . Time was , you just had to figure them out . Solving the puzzle was half the fun . You solve a lot of puzzles in your day ? A few . Some more worth it than others . One was ... especially rewarding . - What happened ? - I died . Oh . I guess she wasn 't level 7 , sir ? She was a cellist , second chair , Portland symphony . Saw her play whenever I was in town . Ever see a beautiful woman play the cello ? It 's something else . She laughed at my jokes , too , which was a very nice bonus . - You know where she is now ? - Of course I do . - I 'm sorry , sir . - I was gone for months . The Avengers thought I was dead , so I had to keep that up ... S.H.I.E.L.D. protocol . It 's probably better this way . Maybe if she 'd been part of the agency ... In my experience , that 's just asking for trouble . Hey . Coulson told me you were helping to , you know , find my long-lost folks , so thanks . I 'm glad you 're in on this with me . It means a lot . Right , I can tell you 're really into this . Um , I 've done a lot of the heavy lifting already , came up with a short list . I thought you might ... We 're on a mission , Skye . Is this why you called me here ? No . I was just working on this while I waited for you . I called ' cause I found something about Po . Show me . Po only had one visitor during his prison stint ... her . You notice the outfit ? Miles said a girl in a flower dress asked him to hack S.H.I.E.L.D. This could be the same girl . - Can we hear the conversation ? - That 's the bummer ... there was no audio , but it 's not a total loss . I was able to use S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s lip-reading program , because we have one of those ! It didn 't work on the girl because she never looks up at the camera , but Po did ... once ... and it caught this . The Clairvoyant does not like to be touched . I wrote that down , so we don 't have to hear that again ... ever . - The Clairvoyant . - Yeah . Does that mean anything to you ? But it means something to them ... to Po and whoever that woman is . - Her name 's Raina . - You know her ? Yeah , she recruited me for Centipede , came up to me at the hospital where I did my back therapy out of the blue . Told me she could change my life . Nice to cut my own meat again . The steak was to your liking ? Overcooked , and the ambience ... We 're not here for the decor . We 've stabilized the serum , added the implant , and now we need the Clairvoyant 's help in finding the key to stage three . I 've asked before . The Clairvoyant has trouble seeing the man you 're looking for and his weaknesses . I don 't mean to upset you . It 's the way of things . This is what 's upsetting me . This S.H.I.E.L.D. teams has destroyed two of our operations . We move every few days now to be safe . Which causes challenges for our maintenance problems . We can 't overstate the toll this takes on our soldiers . They are drained after every mission . Our men need regular injections , constant upkeep . Difficult when S.H.I.E.L.D. has us on the run . Then it 's time to stop running . We 're running her through our systems . Maybe we can get an I.D. , but we 're guessing she 's Centipede 's recruiter and Po 's her latest recruit . Three super soldiers dive-bomb a prison , pluck him out ? He 's her number-one draft pick . But why him ? Centipede 's making more soldiers . Maybe they want Po to coordinate them , lead them . His background 's tactical strategy . He fits the bill . So , these guys have super soldiers , an expert military strategist , and a Clairvoyant who can see the future . Anyone else thinking about switching teams ? They couldn 't have a psychic . There are none on the index . They 're a myth . - So was Thor . - Maybe it 's an alias . Run it through our database and see if anything pops up . Ward is approaching Hayward 's sister now . - Laura Hayward ? - That 's me . Sorry to bother you , But I was hoping you could help me out . - I hope so , too . - I 'm looking for you brother , Brian . - Have you seen him lately ? - I 'm ... I 'm sorry . Who are you ? Dan Filch , Ohio State gaming commission . We 're trying to contact Brian , tell him the good news . - He won the lottery ? - $ 50,000 . Really ? And you 're looking for him ? Don 't you guys want to keep the money ? Sure , but we have to at least try and contact the winners before the ticket expires . Your brother 's does in six days , - so if you know where he is ... - I don 't . Sorry . We 're not close . I haven 't spoken to him since he got back from Afghanistan . Well , now you have a reason to ... 50,000 reasons , actually . So let us know if you hear from him . Okay . Not sure why you wanted to go with the lottery story , sir . - It 's a tough sell . - Exactly . Nothing makes people more suspicious than a handsome man offering them free money . She 's making the call now . Brian , it 's me . Some guy was just waiting for me at school , said you won the lottery . I know , right ? We 're not that lucky . - Is he local ? - No . He 's in Oakland , California . Come in ! Oh , it almost looks homey . Is that Ace ? What a cutie . He must be so proud of you , his dad working for S.H.I.E.L.D. Which he can 't know with everything being classified . That 's all right . He knows I 'm working . Called him on his birthday and gave him all the " Heroes of New York " action figures . Nice . - Are you two close ? - We 're a team . I 'd do anything for this little guy . It 's got to be the best feeling , son looking up to you who wants to grow up to be just like you . Yeah . Looks like he 's growing fast , though . You said you wanted your shot . Here it is . I won 't let you down . - I think it 's quite smart . - How does it feel ? Feels good . Comfortable . Having powers is cheating , but the suit 's pretty cool . It 's perfect for an array of tactical missions . Yeah , also measures your heart rate , systolic pressures , and glucose levels . All while providing state-of-the-art ballistic protection . - Yeah . - Thanks . - Oh , no . Thank you . - We 've never been so proud . Hayward 's cellphone has been traced to an abandoned factory about eight miles from here . Probably Centipede 's new lab . Certainly been there M.O ... we destroy one factory , they set up another , putting us back to square one . - This time , I want answers . - Means we go in quiet , do minimal damage to the facility and the people inside . Ward , May , you 'll go in through the west entrance . Mr. Peterson and I will enter through the loading dock . You 'll run the back end from outside . We 're doing this just us ? We 've been playing whack-a-mole with these guys since Ward first picked me out of my van . Shouldn 't big S.H.I.E.L.D. be sending in backup ? Trust me , they already did . Let 's move . No pressure . - We alone here ? - It appears so . The only heat signatures we 're reading are yours . But there 's a weird electronic signal . I 'm trying to isolate it . Place looks emptied out . Think we 're too late ? Fitz , dial Hayward 's number . Find out . Sir , you 've got company . Yeah , we do . Coming your way . - Usually packs a bigger punch . - Yeah , I remember . What 's happening ? His systolic and diastolic pressures are dropping . - Heart rate 's plummeting , as well . - Sir , he 's in bad shape . Between the physical exertion and this wound , his vitals are dangerously low . Who 's behind Centipede ? Who 's doing this ? ! I won 't say anything . I promise . No ! Please ! Don 't do th ... That 's Mike Peterson , one of our first subjects . He hasn 't been injected with the serum in awhile , but he still has his powers . No . What he has is your key to stage 3 . The one on the left is Akela Amador 's . Hayward 's is on the right . Now , his prosthetic was slightly damaged , but based on digital reconstruction , we can now confirm that the technology is virtually identical . Hayward 's prosthetic has the same internal power source , backscatter capabilities , and biomechanics as Amador . So Centipede also designed the eye implant ? - These guys are serious multitaskers . - Who 's Akela Amador ? Former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent , the first person we encountered with this eye technology , a good agent who was forced to do some bad things . - We helped her . - Kind of a pattern with you guys . So then those soldiers at the warehouse were forced to attack us through that eye thing ? They were getting orders . When the tide turned in our favor , Centipede flipped Hayward 's kill switch , told the other guys to run . Can you track the eye feed like before , find their location ? Nope ... they 've upgraded since Amador . Their feed 's untraceable now . Their technology keeps advancing at a disturbingly rapid pace . They must have endless manpower , resources . And someone with a fat wallet . Po 's the strategist . Raina 's the recruiter . - Perhaps this Clairvoyant 's the money . - That makes sense . If I could see the future , I 'd go straight to Las Vegas . Whoever 's behind them may or may not be psychic , but they 're one step ahead of us every time . I need to update HQ . This is bigger than we thought . - I spoke with the Clairvoyant . - And ? I 'll share the information when the time is right . I would love to hear much more than just ... information . Will you ... tell me what he 's like ? Never . The last person who tried to learn these things got a knife for it . I don 't want to have to do that again , Raina . You have such pretty eyes . I understand . You can 't even whisper to me about him . No , I can 't . But I did tell the Clairvoyant about you . Spoke at length about your many virtues . How sweet . - I 'll pour you a Scotch . - Don 't ever do that again . - Brandy , then ? - When we 're out in the field , your head needs to be on the op , not on me . Time-out . Still playing catch-up here . - What are you talking about ? - You taking a punch for me ? - I don 't need your protection . - You think I don 't know that ? I took that punch ' cause you 're faster than me . You could do more good on your feet . - It was tactical , not personal . - My mistake . I am not some recruit who can 't separate church from state . I 'm on the same page as you . So don 't flatter yourself . Sorry . I didn 't mean to crash . What do you want ? This about that thumb drive again ? - No . - Good . Look , I get that you don 't want to help with that loud and clear , big neon , flashing lights . - But I didn 't ask , okay ? Coulson ... - Coulson doesn 't want to tell you the truth . The truth is ... You have to decide why you 're here . We have a mission , and it 's not to find your parents . If you can 't put aside your personal attachments , then you shouldn 't be here ! - Oh , come on in . - Thanks . - You doing okay ? - Afraid I won 't be ... much good to you for the next couple days . That 's understandable . You went above and beyond at that warehouse , - had our backs more than once . - Thank you , sir . But I know Centipede 's still out there . No , we still got a lot of work to do . True . But according to your S.O. , hard work 's your specialty . - Said you train 24 / 7 . - I want to be the best . And that 's admirable . But you hadn 't left the training facility since you got there , which means you haven 't seen your son since Union Station . Ace is fine . We ... we talk all the time . But you haven 't been to see him . Why ? Mike ! Because the last time he saw me ... I was a monster . My kid saw that . You can 't fix that from here . And staying away , not being there ... I 've seen firsthand the kind of damage that can do . The last thing I want to do is hurt Ace . He 's ... he 's my son , but ... - maybe he 's better off without me . - I don 't think that 's true . When I took this job , I made a choice , the same choice everyone else here made ... this life over the other one , the one with holiday dinners and PTA meetings , recitals . It 's not easy . But if the time comes to make the hard call , it 's simpler . But you have a son . You have someone waiting for you to come home . You need to think about that . You need to think about him . Before you make your choice . Hello ? - Hey , Ace . - Dad ! It is so good to hear your voice , buddy . And I got some good news ... I 'm gonna get to come home and see you for a bit . Awesome ! Then maybe you can meet my new friend . She said she knows you . She 's here right now . Ace , who 's there with you ? Where 's your Aunt Mindy ? Hello , Mike . Remember when I told you I could change your life ? They want a trade ... Ace for his father . - They 've set a time and a place . - Bloody savages . They want to experiment on him , determine how he still has his abilities . And we 're gonna let them ? We 've fought these guys before . We don 't have a choice . The instructions they gave Mr. Peterson were very specific . I called HQ , told them to stand down . - Stand down ? - So we take them alone . We should at least have a hostage-rescue unit in support of this . They said they would murder my son . If we make one wrong move . Any electronics , any comms , any sign of surveillance and they 'll terminate the arrangement . I 'll give myself up , no problem , get him back . - I can figure it out from there . - You 're still recovering . We can 't just hand you over to them like that , can we ? Fitz-Simmons have a non-electronic method of tracking him . Simmons has fabricated an odorless scent . I have an instrument which can detect it . Works like a bloodhound , can track someone from over 50 kilometers . After we make the trade , we 'll be able to follow Mr. Peterson . Buy him some time to get his strength back . We 'll find him . I don 't care what happens to me . As long as my boy is ... I promise you , we 're gonna get your son back . At least let me escort him out for the exchange . Mr. Peterson requested me . I 'm comfortable with that , and if things go South , I need you back here , taking point on the team . - Is Ward in position ? - Yes . But I don 't like any of this . There 'd be something wrong with you if you did . Once the swap happens , I 'll fire up my equipment . We 'll be able to track you wherever they take you . Just don 't do anything that 'll endanger my son . We won 't , but we want to make sure Ace has his dad at the end of the day , too . Time to go . My team won 't let you down . It wasn 't supposed to go down like this . I 'm gonna make this right , I swear . Damn it . Hello , Mike . It 's been awhile . Your son is adorable , and he looks just like you . I don 't believe I 've had the pleasure . Lucky for you . I have to thank you , Mike , for holding up your end of the deal . Let 's just make the trade . Give us Ace , and you can have him . Oh , that wasn 't the deal . I 'm so sorry . Let me know when I can activate comms and the tracker . What 's happening here , Mike ? Well , in exchange for his son , we asked Mike to deliver you . I 'm not at full strength , but I can still crush your throat . New deal ! My son for your life ! Sadly , my employer cares no more for my life than your son 's . If I die , so does he , and his death will be so much worse . - You need to let her go . - I told them they could have me . But they want you . Why do they want you ? I don 't know , but if you kill this woman , you 'll never see your son again . But how will I look him in the eye ? How will I explain what I did ? We talked about this . I 'm so sorry . Let 's finish this . Dad ! There 's his son . Oh , thank god . I have no stomach for this . On my mark , activate comms and tracker . - If there had been any other way ... - You made the only choice you had . What happened ? They took Coulson . All right , call it in . We need backup . I have a shot . Do not engage . They 'll kill Coulson . Stand down . I 'll contact HQ . - Are you okay ? - I 'm fine , Dad . S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ , this is S.H.I.E.L.D. RG422 . We need immediate satellite support . Ace , I 've got to make something right . Daddy loves you so much , okay ? Stay with Skye . You remember Skye , right ? Keep him safe . Take care of my boy ! No ! Mike ! Where 's Coulson ? Oh , my god . Coulson . - We land in half an hour . - Good . The sooner we begin , the better . Whatever this is , whatever you think you 're doing , it won 't work . I won 't give you what you want . You will . And we want is simple . We want you to tell us about the day after you died . sync correction by f1nc0 , chamallow web dl sync snarry

 This is what destiny intended From the moment it entered the star system . [ colonel everett young ] : That ship Is the best chance we have of getting home . Are we done ? We 'll never be done . [ punching , grunting ] [ camile wray ] : You shouldn 't have left him on the planet . [ young ] : You think I don 't know that ? [ chloe armstrong ] : Everyone thinks we 're safe . They think that they 'll never find us again . Why did you take one of our people prisoner ? [ snarls and vocalizes ] [ chloe ] : We 're not safe , are we ? - They 're coming ! - Who 's coming ? Lucian alliance . They 're coming to take destiny . [ rush ] : There 's only one way this is going to end If we wait . [ young ] : I 'm not surrendering this ship . I want to know How long you plan on keeping us locked up . What do we have to do to earn our freedom ? Prove to me that you 're not a threat . [ eli wallace ] : My mom was a nurse . She got stuck by a needle Trying to restrain a junkie in the e.R. She got h.I.V. [ sharon walker ] : Do whatever you need to do To get yourself back home , 'cause I 'm going to be here . [ gunfire ] What happened ? You were shot . There is no leg wound . It 's almost completely healed . How is that possible ? I don 't know . Hey . What are you doing in here ? Are you okay ? I don 't know how I got here . The last thing I remember , I was lying down for a nap . Sleepwalking ? I used to do it all the time As a kid . My dad had to put an alarm on the front door to make- - I 'll see you later . Oh ... Okay . Seriously . And it 's not just this one thing . She been acting a little odd For a while now . You know what I 'm talking about , right ? It 's not just me noticing- - No , no . You 're right . She 's been acting ... Different . She 's quiet and withdrawn . We should talk to her about it . I did . I mean , I tried , yesterday . And ? And nothing . She wasn 't in the mood . She was too busy writing in her diary . She keeps a diary ? It 's kind of a therapy for her . It 's all the stress of being on the ship- - Oh , and what about that gunshot wound on her leg ? No one heals that fast . How do you explain that ? Eli ... I can 't . You need to use the stones . Your mother 's sick . What ... Is she- - I don 't know the details , Just that they want you to go back as soon- - You need to sleep , nic . Nicholas ... Yes , yes . Soon . [ beeping ] Manipulating the countdown clock Is , um ... Complicated , to say the least . So many variables tied into it . Well , that 's the problem , isn 't it ? A myriad of systems , each as complicated as the next . Made worse By one man trying to do the work of an entire crew . Well , for now , I just need to control the countdown clock , And if you are indeed the ship , Why aren 't you helping me ? What are you reallyy hoping to gain ? Control of the ship is key to the mission . [ over radio ] : Dr. Rush , this is brody . Come in . Go ahead . We just dropped out of ftl . Yes , I 'm aware of that , thank you . But again , no gates in range . [ dr . Lisa park ] : And now we 're banking left , Changing course again . It doesn 't make sense . Dr. Rush ? Dr. Rush ? Look , I 'm sorry , I can 't get away right now . Where are you ? What are you doing ? Rush out . This is getting ridiculous . Getting old , is what it is . [ slams down radio ] She stopped taking her treatment . Unfortunately , her counts dropped , Dipping below 300 . Opening the door for pneumonia . We 've re-started the avr therapy , And we 're successfully treating the pneumonia . Her counts have leveled off , So physically , she 's on the mend , But if she stops taking her treatment again- - Don 't let her . Okay , when she returns home- - Don 't release her . Keep her here . We will monitor her condition closely , But what concerns me Is she is still clearly suffering from depression . One of our psychiatrists has been treating her , But hasn 't made much progress , Which is why we sent for you . Look , whether here or at home , she has to want to get better . There 's no room for error now . If her counts drop below 200- - Yeah , yeah , I know . Aids . I 'll be down the hall if you need me . [ knocking on door ] [ monitor beeping quietly ] Hi . I 'm ... Airman tracy . I 've been working with your son , eli . Is he all right ? Yeah , he 's fine . He really wanted to be here , But the military , They 've got him pretty tied up . He 's doing great things , though , Working really hard . Anyway , He heard about you being in the hospital . Tell him I 'm fine . No , but see , he ... He knows you 're not fine . He told me about your condition . He heard you stopped taking your meds , And he 's really ... Really worried about you . Not enough to be here himself . [ speaks chinese ] Yeah , it 's me . [ laughing ] : I was just checking . [ both laughing ] Where are we ? What ? You and me . Our relationship . I mean ... If we had met in a different situation , Away from this ship , Would we still be together ? Of course . It 's just ... This is all kind of new to me , you know ? I 've never been all that great at ... Relationships , And ... I just want to make sure that I don 't mess this up . You 've been kind of quiet lately , So I start wondering , and thinking- - Matt ... Ta-dah , your favorite . Mm . I am really missing your cooking . Hmm . Microwave 's getting a lot of work , huh ? [ chuckling ] : Yeah , and take-out . Mostly take-out . You know me . I work most nights , so ... A lot of pizza . Everything okay ? Of course . You 're here . Everything is perfect . Ah ... Mm . It 's really good . Go . You 're releasing them ? We can 't keep them locked up forever , sergeant . Sir , I beg to differ . We 're not doing it without strings attached . They 've been giving us intel . The more they give , The more they get . The decision 's made , sergeant . I 've put an escort On each lucian alliance member , So it 's not like they 're walking around free . Excuse me , colonel ? Have you seen chloe ? No . I 've been searching everywhere for her . She- - she 's gone . Mornin ' . Yeah , so the clock says . Well , apparently It 's Sunday , too . [ footsteps approaching ] The colonel decided to release them Into the general population . We 'll see how that turns out . [ whispers ] [ thump on table ] Whoa ! Doesn 't look like it 's off to a good start . Hey . What 's going on here ? Just making conversation . No , no , you apologize to her . Why ? Apologize ! All right , take it easy . Think you can tell me what to do ? As a matter of fact , I do . I 'm not trying to- - What the hell are you- - You don 't mess with my people . Just talking to the woman- - No , see , you don 't talk to anyone . Oh , is she yours ? I didn 't know . Put him back in the hold ... Till he learns some manners . I 'm sorry , I 'm not trying to- - No , no , see , the more you talk , The longer you 'll be locked up . You okay ? Chloe 's missing . Colonel wants us to form search teams And look for her . [ indicator beeps as ship jumps , sound distorts momentarily ] You work yourself to exhaustion . Much work to be done . Lack of sleep leads to carelessness . I needn 't remind you That two lives have already been lost . Colonel ... I know . I 'm sorry . My behavior- - unacceptable . Yeah , it was . I know it 's important to fit in ... To get along with your people , And I can do this , I promise . We made a deal . We give you information , you give us freedom , And I intend to hold up my end of that deal . You can trust me . Chloe ... Chloe . What are you doing in here ? [ lieutenant vanessa james ] : Lieutenant scott ... We found her . Copy that . What are you looking for ? My keys . You can 't find your keys . No . I thought they were in my purse , but- - [ laughs ] : Ladies and gentlemen , this is a first . You know , you 've never misplaced anything As long as I can- - Are you going to help me find them Or not ? I 'm sorry . It 's just , I 'm late , And I can 't- - I was bringing the groceries in yesterday . Idiot . - It 's okay . - No , it 's not . Because anyone could 've walked in here And taken all of our things- - Sharon , sharon . I 'll be an hour at most , maybe two . I 'll call you if anything changes . Morning . You up for company ? Sure . You 're looking better . Doctor said You 'll be out of here in no time . Why doesn 't he call me ? It 's been months now . Nothing . It 's not like him . Okay . Okay . What 's your favorite movie of all time ? What ? Just go with me on this . Your favorite movie . Grease . No , there 's another one . Sound of music ? No , what- - Your favorite science fiction movie ? Oh , I 'm not a fan of- - E.T. Right ? That 's your favorite . Yes . I love that movie . You rented it And showed it to him when he was a kid . You wondered , if aliens really existed , If it 's possible to fly spaceships To other planets In other solar systems . What has this got to do with- - It is ... Possible . Not just to other solar systems . Other galaxies . You see , the government , they have this program , The stargate program , And what a stargate is , Is it 's like a doorway . It allows you to step through And travel great distances through space , Halfway across the universe In some cases- - Why are you telling me this ? Because I am eli . I 'm on a ship , far , far away , But my consciousness is in this person 's body . It really is me , mom . I am your son . You have no memory Of going into the storage room ? No . I fell asleep in my quarters . Next thing I know , I 'm talking to lieutenant james . This isn 't the first time this has happened , is it ? It 's like I ... Black out from time to time . Those aliens used the communication stones To take control of lieutenant james- - Because we forgot to reset them . I was just in the communications lab . The stones are clean . Listen , there doesn 't seem To be anything physically wrong with you That I can tell . I 'd need an eeg or a cat scan To be more thorough . I would like to keep her overnight , though , For observation . That 's a good idea . ... And once the stone is in place And the device is turned on , You actually swap consciousness With the person on the other end . You go into their body , And then they go into yours , and ... And ... You don 't believe me . I don 't understand . I- - I know . I know , it 's weird . Where is eli ? He 's on a ship , okay , the destiny , On the other side of the universe . When is he coming home ? I don 't know , it 's a long , long way- - Billions of light years from earth . How did he get there ? The stargate , mom ! [ sighs ] : Okay . Okay , mom- - Stop calling me that . You are not my son . The day dad left ... I was 14 . I ran up to my room , crying . You came up , Told me that I needed to be strong for you . You said I needed to be the man that he wasn 't . Remember ? How could I know that if I wasn 't eli ? He could 've told you . How could he possibly have told me Every little thing about his- - Leave me alone ! Please , mom . It really is me . Nurse , nurse ! I know it 's a lot to take in . Mom- - Nurse ! Please leave . What is it ? Ancient ? Some of it . Those symbols , they looked familiar to me , And then I remembered where I saw them . In the crashed alien ship . Some of this I understand , But most of it 's too far advanced . They must 've done something to her , Planted something in her brain . You said she didn 't have any tracking devices in her . No , she didn 't , Not that I was aware of . There may be something happening to chloe On a cellular level , Some kind of genetic manipulation Gradually changing her . Into what ? You think she 's changing into one of them ? I want her quarantined . Wait- - we don 't know for sure If that 's what 's going on here . We cannot just lock her up . Until we know what 's wrong with her , I can 't risk Letting her walk around free on this ship , can I ? I think the risk might be worth it . If we can monitor her behavior- - The frequency of her blackouts , Where she goes , what she does , We might gain more insight Into what 's actually happening . Certainly quicker than isolating her in a room . She 's not to be left alone , Ever . Yes , sir . Hey . Thanks for coming . I didn 't have anyone else I could call . How- - how 's your mom doing ? Physically , fine . Her pneumonia 's healing , Her t-cell counts are stable Now that they 've restarted her therapy , But she 's ... I was always worried She might give up If something happened to me , and now , she 's- - Nothing 's happened to you . She doesn 't even know it 's me . I tried to tell her , But ... As far as she 's concerned , The military took her son away , Won 't even tell her where he is Or won 't let him talk to her . I would give up too . Eli , No one is giving up . You know , whether she believes you or not , She has to take her meds , And you need to make her understand that . I can 't go near the control interface room ... Or use the stones to visit my mom . It 's only temporary , Just till we figure out what 's going on here . Lieutenant . Time for a shift change . I 'll take over from here . Oh , it 's okay . I don 't mind- - Colonel 's orders , I 'm afraid . I promise I won 't let her out of my sight . It 's all right . Okay . I 'll check in on you later . Come with me . What is this ? A place for study . Problems to solve . Does any of this look familiar to you ? Take your time . Look closely . Settling in ? Yes . Nice quarters . Come in . The ancients probably figured they 'd be here a while , Might as well give themselves some measure of comfort . How long Will they be tagging along with us ? As long as you give them reason to . One of your men , simeon . Yes , I know . I heard . And I 'm sorry . He 's not the most diplomatic person In our group . The culture on his homeworld was rougher than most . Colonel young has decided to release him , But if he slips up again- - I 'll talk to him . We 're trying to make this work . He needs to try harder . Hey . Oh , there you are . Been looking all over for you . You didn 't answer your radio , So I thought- - Sorry . Lost track of time . She 's all yours . You okay ? Yeah . Fine . What were you doing ? He wanted me to look at some equations , See if I understood them . Did you ? I don 't know . Hey , sorry I 'm late . It 's just that eli , you know , When he gets to talking ... How 's his mother ? Oh ... Doing okay , physically . It 's just emotionally . This is all starting to take its toll . You okay ? Your dinner 's in the oven . [ surprised ] : You cooked ? Mm . An attempt . Looks good . Famous last words . So , um ... How was your day ? Long . Exhausting . The usual . I 'll get another . Give us a minute . Back inside . I won 't let you ruin this for us . I was just talking to the woman . You want to get us all locked up for good ? What difference does it make ? Sooner or later they 'll realize The " information " we 've been feeding them Is just a bunch of lies anyway . The information you 've been feeding them . What are you talking about ? I thought we were all giving them The same misinformation- - We 're cooperating with them . All of us . We have to find a way To get along with these people . You want me to play the game , I 'll play it , But I 'm not taking- - Don 't play any game at all . Don 't play any game at all ! Just keep your mouth shut . Dammit . Again with this ? No gates . Altered course . Bet you a day 's rations he doesn 't answer . Dr. Rush , this is brody . Come in . Dr. Rush , please respond . You owe me . I never agreed to that . I don 't think it 's because of pulsar damage . There would be a pattern to the jump intervals , However frequent they are . There 's also the changes in the ship 's course Once we drop out of ftl . It also seems too coincidental That every time this happens , We can 't seem to get ahold of rush . He 's doing this ? How ? Outside of cracking the master code ? I don 't know . Figure it out . Yeah , we could really use eli for that . Eli 's not here right now . You can get him back . He needs to be where he is right now , So I need you to figure it out . [ young ] : Why is your radio off ? Sorry , I was in my quarters sleeping . Wrong . You didn 't answer my call , I sent corporal barnes to your quarters . Where were you ? Okay , so , uh , what 's happening ? What 's wrong ? Just trying to figure out what 's going on with destiny . Where the hell were you ? What 's this ? I come here to think . And write on the walls ? Working on problems that have confused us Since we set foot in this ship , mr . Brody . This one has been particularly frustrating , And yet chloe , She solved it in a minute flat . Whatever alien influence she 's under , It 's studying this ship . So you think she 's hijacked the ship 's system During one of her blackouts ? Something she could have set in motion Days , perhaps even weeks ago . Uh , this section 's off limits . Wasn 't earlier . It is now . Why ? Back to your quarters . You 're going to keep doing this , aren 't you ? Pushing me , Get me to do something So you can lock me back up . Back to your quarters . You 're talking tough , you 're armed , You got your men here covering you . That 's true . Dismissed . You were saying ? You okay ? Uh , just let me know , And we 'll get you whatever you need . Colonel 's just doing this as a precaution . What do they think is happening to me ? They don 't know yet . I feel like I 'm slipping away , Bit by bit . No . We 're going to figure this out . We 're going to fix it . I promise . You can 't sleep ? I look at you , and I know it 's you , But still ... I miss ... Your face ... Your voice . This is hard . Probably worse on you than it is for me . This situation ... It 's so easy to lose hope . I 've seen it in others , But what keeps me sane Are these few moments we 're together , Being able to come home and see you and ... And hold you , Even if it 's just for a day or a minute ... It 's ... It 's what 's keeping me going . I 'll be okay . I know . It 's coming up now ... There . She just sits there the whole time ? Yes . In her earlier one , She wrote in the diary . But mostly she just sits or lies still , Staring at the walls . I still can 't detect Any physical changes in her . Without proper equipment , I don 't really know what else I can do . Colonel , I know you 're just doing this To keep her away from others , But quarantine is not a long-term solution . I know . Nurse ? Wait , no . Please , just- - just listen , And then I 'll leave . I promise . Whether you believe me or not , The fact is , I 'm worried . Eli 's worried . I can 't leave you here like this . He was all that I had . He 's why I got up in the morning . Never realized it fully until he was gone ... Just tell me ... Will I ever see him again ? I don 't know . I can 't leave her like this . I can 't go back to that ship . If I leave her , she 's going- - Eli , eli , listen to me . Whatever happens , you will get through this . Maybe you could talk to her . Someone else from the stargate program . Maybe then She 'll believe me . I 've got a better idea . I 'll call you right back . I know it 's beyond her clearance . You 're just going to have to make an exception . He unlocked the ninth chevron . He 's quite possibly The most important person on that crew . We need him to be emotionally healthy , Focused . You know what , I 'm not asking you . I 'm telling you , make this happen . Mrs. Wallace , welcome to the destiny . Hi , mom . Yeah , I 'm real . Oh , eli ... Eli ... Come here . I want to show you something . The other side of the universe , mom . Pretty cool , isn 't it ? Yeah ... I know . I was speechless at first , too , If you can believe that . It 's an amazing ship . We 're still trying to figure it out ... See if there 's some way we can get back home . I 'll never stop trying . I promise . We 're going to be okay , mom , You and me . I 'm so proud of you . Yeah , blew her mind , didn 't it ? Oh , yeah . She 's leaving the hospital tomorrow . Thanks for letting her come here . And don 't worry , She knows it 's a one-time thing . She won 't be asking to come by every week . Anyway ... I owe you one . You owe wray . She 's the one who made it happen . [ rush , over radio ] : Colonel young , come in . Yeah , go ahead . I think I have a solution to chloe 's condition . Well , let 's hear it . The neural interface . The chair ? I believe it can cure her . Look , it 's relatively simple . From what I 've learned so far , I believe the chair Will not allow any non-human to interface with it . There are safeguards built in That would destroy any alien lifeform That tries to use it . So the chair kills off any potential alien matter Inside her , While leaving her human side unaffected . Exactly . You " believe , " meaning you 're not sure ? Well , no , I can 't be absolutely certain- - It 's too dangerous . Look , I 've made improvements To the program I developed When I used the chair . They should prevent her from being harmed . I 'm now able to sever the connection externally , At a time . She shouldn 't have to sit in it For very long , A few seconds at most . If you can 't be 100 % sure , I don 't think we should- - It 's the best option anyone 's come up with . The only option . Colonel , you can 't force her to do this . Well , then , I 'll ask her . You sure you 're okay with this ? Yes , I 'm fine . It 's all right . The chair won 't activate Until I input the proper command . We 're ready . Okay . Go ahead . She 's breathing and her pulse is steady . Did it work ? I believe so , But we 'll soon find out , won 't we ? Hey . Hey . I just wanted to thank you For pulling the strings To let my mom come here . I know it 's something That ... A lot of people here Would want . Does she believe you now ? Yeah . Yeah , she does . They 're discharging her from the hospital today . Oh . Anyway ... It was great having you there To talk to . Someone who gets what we 're going through ... We 'll keep an eye on her , 24 / 7 . You okay ? Yeah . Can I get you anything ? No . I 'm good . Just want to lie down for a little bit . I 'm fine , matt . Mrs. Wallace ? Yes . I 'm sharon walker . Your son eli suggested- - Oh , yes . Hello . We need to talk . I 'm not cured , am I ? No . Do you really think she can help you ? I do , yes . If she values her freedom , She 'll play along without telling anyone . I need her to be this way . For now , anyway . But can you trust her ?

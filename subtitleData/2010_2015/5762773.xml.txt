 I 'm your birth mother . Mrs S , she 's not who she says she is . You know what to do . Kira ! What the hell is going on ? Did Racheljust take my family ? We 've come here to take you to Kira . Tonight there 's a big event at the Dyad . Rachel will be there . How do you get next to Rachel with Daniel in the way ? Rachel 's a very busy woman but if you tell me where you are , I 'll bring you to her . Who in the hell are you ? This is our mistake . I want my own lab . Thank you , Dr Leekie . - You 're Sarah . - Yeah , nice to meet you , too . I want my daughter . If you don 't have her , you 're dead ! Not the Dyad people , somebody else took Kira . I know . The cowboy who took the shotgun blast was a religious extremist . A Prolethean . SARAH : Helena 's people . ( MONITOR BEEPING ) Okay , an Eastern European accent and scarification ? Angel wings . No ID . But here are the things in her pockets . OFFICER : Sugar packs . Lollipops . Shot point-blank in the chest and she walks in ? How is she even alive ? It 's okay . It 's all right . It 's okay . ( MONITOR BEEPING QUICKLY ) ART : What do these Proletheans want with your daughter ? SARAH : I don 't know , Art . Everybody 's after us . ( KNOCKING ) - Hey . - We 're going to find her . - Okay . Yeah . Thank you . - Okay ? Good . Hello , Arthur . I can 't believe you let a cop into clone club . Yeah , well , I 'm over it . Finally this whole shit-show 's starting to make sense . So if these religious freaks have Kira , how do we find them ? ( MOBILE RINGING ) - It 's out of town . - ART : They 've got a number of branches . Hello ? - We 've just got to figure out which one . - Kira ? - Kira ? - Give it to me . - Kira ? Hello ? - Mommy , I 'm not supposed to call . I 'm so glad you did ! Where are you , baby ? I don 't know . I 'm scared . There 's a weird man here . Kira ? Kira ? It 's a listed number . It 's a motel in Bridgelake County . Let 's go or they 'll be gone . Whoa . It could be a trap . - She 's going with me . - Yeah , it could still be a trap . - Fe , stop . - But ... Wait ! Just a minute , p * lease . New clone phones . I 'll get these ones to Cosima and Alison . Numbers are already stored in there . This one 's for me . Thank you . When we 're back together , we 're leaving , yeah ? Yeah . Costa Rica . I 've heard that one before . Look , I need you to keep telling me we can make it . We can . We remember Aynsley 's warmth , her devotion to family , to community . We remember early mornings with the Bailey Downs Ice Queens , long evenings on stage rehearsing various theatre productions . And some of us remember book club . Or as Aynsley called it , " full contact reading " . She wanted us to ... self-reflect . And she would say almost daily , " Be true to who you are . " She has got a lot of gall coming here after sleeping with Chad . - I mean , assaulting her in the street ... - ( ALL MURMURING ) If you wanted to have a glass right now , I wouldn 't blame you one bit . No , thank you , Donnie . I think I 'll stay clear-headed , indefinitely . - ( CHILDREN LAUGHING ) - Where did you get these flowers ? They 're Aynsley 's . What ? No , no , no , no . You take those back ! Don 't worry , I got it . I got it . And then we can go home . - Yes , please . - Here , hold my coat . Guys , what are you thinking ? Come on . Sorry , Father . - Alison ? - Hmm ? - I 'm so sorry . - Oh , thank you , Sarah , really . I feel like the play is saving my life right now . You lost a friend . And they shouldn 't be treating you like this . Thank you . Oh , that 's okay . See you at rehearsal . Okay . ( MOBILE VIBRATING ) Margaret , hi . I 'll catch you later . - Ali ? - Mmm-hmm ? - Shall we ? - Yep . Okay , Gemma , here you go . Come on . Let 's go . You did wel * I to save her , Mark . Helena is the twin sister of the mother , the one that got away . She almost didn 't make it . - Real close . - Yeah . Here , steady her for me . Gentle . She shouldn 't buck a bit . All right . Now , easy , girl . ( MOOING ) Hand me the Al gun . Now we just ... Slide that in directly into the cervix . And ... There you go . The rest is up to the Lord , just helping along a little bit . Amen , pastor . We 're going to need a little help , too , Mark , getting that girl out of the hospital . Yeah , I imagine so . Well , Henrik ? Am I making up another bed or not ? That is entirely dependent on Mark here , Bonnie . I 'll do my best . You know we love you like a son , right ? You 're the only one we trust with all this . Thank you . So what , you 're accusing me of colluding with Sarah ? To ... To ... I 'm sorry . To shit-kick Rachel ? Well , I don 't know . Why would I do that ? Aldous ... Sarah , she 's a con-artist . She foo * led us , too . - Did she ? - She stole your pass card . - Really ? - Mmm-hmm . I 'm sorry . None of us ever trusted her . Let me just say , Rachel takes insult very personally . If you want to help Sarah , you 'd be in a unique position to do so here at the Dyad . I for one would like to avoid a war . And ljust want to make crazy science with you in our new lab . - They 're gone . - Shit . - When ? How long ? - About an hour ago . A young girl matching Kira 's description and some guy . Hey , come on . Wait , Siobhan wasn 't with them ? - There was no woman at all ? - No . Just the guy . Hey . - Art ! - Find something ? Yeah . That 's hers . Hold up . That 's Daniel , Rachel 's bloody Doberman . You stay put . I 've been hoping to run into this guy again . Police officer . Put your hands on the car . I said get your hands on the car . Can I help you , Detective Bell ? I have a permit for that . You 're a private investigator this time ? You 're going to regret this , professionally speaking . - I know where you live . - Oh , I don 't doubt that . I know where you work . ( CONVERSATION CONTINUES , INDISTINCT ) - You 're a bright man , Detective . - What are you doing here ? Huh ? What are you doing here ? You can tell me at the station . ( ENGINE IDLING ) ( GASPS ) If you want to see Kira , you 'd better shut up and get in . This is your stop . If you don 't get too stroppy , I 'll help you out . Where is my daughter ? Someone will be along . - ( GRUNTS ) - Where is she ? You piece of shit ! Stop . What the bloody hell ? Bloody hell ! I 'm sorry , Benjamin . You didn 't sign up for that . No , I certainly did not . - What the hell is going on ? - Relax , Kira 's fine . - What , he 's not a Prolethean ? - ( LAUGHS ) No , Chicken , you just passed through an airlock . - A what ? - An airlock . When Kira called you , I knew you 'd come for her and bring your troubles with you . Here 's the phone . It was ringing . I took out the batteries . Thanks , Ben . - Safe home . - You too , S. What happened with Amelia ? I 'm not telling you shite till I see Kira . Better get a move-on . We 've quite a hike . Whose side are you on , S ? Yours , love . It 's always been yours . Now , while it may lack some lustre , the old wing is where our most sensitive research takes place . Like when you were sterilising lunatics in the ' 30s ? Before my time . She 's being cheeky again . She knows that Dyad was inventing vaccines . Yes , polio , Spanish influenza . - Manufactured right here . - COSIMA : Right . Shipped all over the world and millions of lives saved . Oh , so this is where you keep the clones ? Well , obviously , you 're part of a high-security programme . Yeah , most restricted projects are entirely compartmentalised . Right , so smart people don 't know what they 're actually working on . Ah , but you will . You 're working on yourself . Uh , do the honours ? - I was right , it 's clonejail . - It 's not . You know , if I wanted an obsolete lab , I could just go to a community college . We 're going to customise it . LEEKIE : Here your opportunities will be endless . Just last month I emailed a vaccine to a colleague in Delhi , who then recreated it on a 3D biological printer . That is completely amazing . Think of what we could build in this room . Please , make a list . Equipment , personnel , just ... blue-sky it . Together . Well , I know nobody likes to touch a dead body but I was really hoping you 'd help me clean up the blood . I 'll help . # We are blood buds till the end # It is written in our hearts # We will be together till the day that death takes us apart # And now we must heed the call # Cleaning the brains off the wall # The task may be unpleasant but it 's ours # Try not to complain as you 're scrubbing out the stain # This is dirty work , dirty work # Sing , sing , singing away the hours ♪ Shout till I ... ♪ Sorry . Fiddlesticks . Left , right , left , er , left , right ? - Let 's do it again ? - No . We 're going to take five , and I mean five . Carter , no more sobbing . Alison , please . Okay . - Sorry . - It 's okay . - Here . - Mmm-hmm . - Okay , now , do you feel that ? - Mmm-hmm . That is you breathing very high . - Yes . - That 's anxiety residue . - Okay . - What you want to do is you want to breathe from here , - from the sacrum . - What ? From the sacrum to the diaphragm and out . - Let 's do it , okay ? - Are you sure that 's my sacrum ? - No , right . Feel it right here , and in . - ( INHALES ) - And out ... - Out . - In . - Excuse me . - And out ... - Ah ! Thank god ! Sarah , everybody , this is Felix , my acting coach . Hello , you all look wonderful . Hi , I 'm Alexander , I 'm the director . Yes , I 've seen where that hand 's been . Okay , let 's just go . We 'll be right back , thank you . Donnie is your husband , Aynsley is your monitor . - No . No , I was wrong . - Yes ! I was wrong , Felix . Vague text messages . They don " t prove anything . You have a history of jumping to monitor conclusions . What have I done ? Aynsley 's dead . I 'm sorry , what ? There was an , uh , an accident with her garbage disposal . Her scarf got caught and ... she choked to death . Oh , my god ! And I was there . I watched it happen , Felix . I didn " t do anything about it . Shh . Okay , okay , look . - Are you joking ? - No ! - No ? - No , no , no . I thought it was her . We all did . We ... - It was Donnie all along . - Okay . - I killed Aynsley . - No , no , darling . - Yes , I did , yes . - No . Well ... I mean , not really , you know , just , like , hardly . Oh , god , you can 't tell Sarah , please . You can 't tell anybody . ( STAMMERING ) I can 't ... I can 't go tojail , oh , my god . I have two children . I can 't ... Nobody 's going tojail , okay ? No one 's going to jail . Wejust need to prove that Donnie 's really your monitor . How ? I mean , he 's bamboozled me for all of these years . He is very good at being evil . Yes . Yes , he is , terribly . So here 's what we do . We set a trap . Give him some monitorish information and see if he reacts like a monitor . - Uh-huh . - Okay . Got any ideas or you just want to keep drinking ? I think I need to keep drinking for a while and then I 'll have an idea . I made things worse , Siobhan ... - Why didn 't you call me ? - I couldn 't trust the phones . There was more than one person watching the house , I knew someone was coming , so I tossed the place . I made it look like an abduction to confuse the issue . I put Kira first . You think I didn 't ? Hey , I know this place . This is where we landed when we left the UK . Hello , Sarah , we * lcome back . Barry . The birdwatchers . My old network . They helped us disappear once . They 're helping again . Well , look at you . Brenda , yeah ? Yeah , she remembers . Well done . Such a beauty and all grown up . - I wouldn 't say either . - Oh . Mommy ! Monkey ! Come here ! Oh , I was so worried about you . I didn 't know where you were . - We came to the birdwatchers . - I know . Are you all right ? Are you sure ? Come on inside . I know I could use a drink . Could have answered your phone . ART : What 's the point ? I don 't know , quash the wild rumours you 're about to get suspended ? Union rep 's on it . No . So , what , I got to beat it out of you ? What the hell happened ? You know that lawyer ? The real connected one ? Pulled the rug out from under us during the Sarah Manning thing ? Well , we crossed paths and words were exchanged . He 's the one trying to get you suspended ? I got something that might help . You know Carp , the patrol guy ? Mentioned he 's got the weirdest Jane Doe in hospital . - Holy shit . - Yeah . That 's what , * like , number five ? Don 't go there , Angie . Just drop it . Alison Hendrix ... Just drop the whole thing . But you 're getting screwed , Art . And what aboutjustice for Beth ? Look , I 'm serious . Leave it a * lone . - You 're not going there . - Not going there . I 'm here about the Jane Doe that came in last night , the gunshot vic ? Sure , she 's right down here . Where 'd she go ? ( SIGHS ) You 're kidding . Who are you ? Family . Nervous , Gracie ? It 's not usua * I , is it ? I 'm sure we seem as strange to them as they do to us . Just do as your father says . Hello , Gracie . Will it eat ? Of course she will . Come on , Gracie , don 't be scared . She needs our care . And we need her trust . ( MAN GRUNTING ) Forgive me . An old custom . Hello , Tomas . I am so grateful to your family for my rescue and for hers . I found myself praying for her soul . - Well , that 's not so crazy , is it ? - Abominations have no soul . Though one could easily mistake the bullet missing her heart for a miracle . It is a miracle , my friend . Your charge has a genetic anomaly . She 's a mirror . See , her internal organs are all reversed . What ? It 's a condition that , uh , sometimes occurs with identical twins . Kind of a yin-yang sort of thing . One of them 's right-handed . One of them 's left-handed . One of them has her heart on the left side and one of them has their heart ... Her heart is on the wrong side . This is surely the mark of corruption . Yeah , well , that 's where I disagree with you . You see , I steered my faith through science at MIT and what I see here ... What I see here is God opening a whole new door . But what you see is not who she is . Your new order should appreciate this wretch is not merely an affront , she is the war for the future of creation . I got no argument with you there . You 're welcome here , Tomas , both of you , for as long as it takes her to recover . Hey look , that 's where Uncle Felix bashed his head open . Thanks to his foster sister who was helping him down the stairs head first . He asked for it . We don 't get many through these days , but we could still kit out an army if we had to . All sizes and shapes . - Mrs S says I have your old bed . - Yeah , I think you do . Look , that 's me and that 's Uncle Felix . Oh , Marjorie , that 's horrible . But I can 't , I can 't today . No , absolutely not . Now , make it sound all dire , you know ? And , oh , mention Sarah . We 're all obsessed with Sarah . No , not even an emergency . I can 't talk to Sarah . I can 't . That 's not my business . Now set the hook . I absolutely cannot do it today . No , no . Fine . Looking good , Teddy . Do you need a stretch ? I need to go out . It 's absolutely essential . I followed her to the cemetery . You said to call if she had contact with a Sarah someone , right ? Manning . Sarah Manning . I don 't know who that is . Oh ... Here comes someone . Yeah , someone 's coming , hang on . Alison . Sarah , hi . Oh , honey , look at you . You 're shaking . Oh . Really nice of you to come by on such short notice . Of course I came . It 's a * lot , eh ? Aynsley passing and taking over her role . Okay , I 'm back . It 's Sarah Stubbs . Who 's that ? She 's in the play with Alison . Wasn 't that ... My husband . Uh , I don 't know her very well but she 's probably early 30s , I guess you 'd say plus-size ? Donald , stop talking . That 's not the right Sarah . Okay , well , then , what do you want me to do now ? Hang up , Donnie . Hello ? Oh ! - Alison . - Hel * lo , Donnie . Uh , I guess you 're wondering , um ... Hmm ? Honey ... You haven 't even cried yet . I knew you were coming here , to see Aynsley . I was worried . Worried ? That I might ... do something drastic ? To myself ? To you ? I was just worried . Would you like to join us ? No , um ... - You be with your friend . I 'm sorry . - Yeah . I love you . She 's not used to being cooped up . Yeah , that makes two of us . So , what were you planning to do with her ? Before I showed up ? I 've organised drivers , booked two flights on the red-eye to London tonight . London 's where this all started . Will you follow ? You and Fe ? They 're for me and Kira , Sarah . You and Felix can stay here with Brenda . When it 's safe , I 'll organise to bring you , there are people in the UK I haven 't seen in a long time , - people with answers . - She 's my daughter . And your next move is what , exactly ? Because so far , you 've done a piss-poor job of keeping her safe . Yeah ... It 's all my fault , yeah ? No . No , but it is your reality . And my care of Kira has always been bulletproof , has it not ? What is this ? Project LEDA ? Well , you clearly know something I don 't . Amelia gave that to me . Well , what does she say it is ? She warned me about you . As she died of a stab wound from Helena . She put you with these people . I 'm sorry , Sarah . I 'm very sorry but I swear to you , I don 't know who they are . MRS S : Brenda , you 've outdone yourself . It 's nice to feed a proper pack again . To safe travels . Mmm-hmm . Brenda used to run strike kitchens on nothing more than scrap meat and canned veg . I tried to keep Siobhan in the kitchen , but she preferred scrubbing Kalashnikovs to pots and pans . What kind of strikers need machineguns ? I was on guns for funds . Running weapons to finance freedom , it made a lot of sense at the time . Not particularly effective but good times . Then we lost Jamie . Who 's Jamie ? Jamie 's my dad . There 's always a high price to pay for righting wrongs . Does this extractor fan even work ? - Uh ... - That 's okay , we 'll get it fixed . Right . You making , like , a shopping list for me ? I am . Okay , chill zone up here . - With , like , a Persian rug . - ( CHUCKLES ) And this really nice leather couch . Hang on , does a gene chip system make a two-channel array moot ? Moot ? ( BOTH CHUCKLE ) You 're so cute . ( BEEPING ) Well , so much for security . Hello . Rachel Duncan . You sure are . Uh , I 'm Cosima . The real Cosima , not the one who kicked your ass or whatever . Got to love concealer . I hear you 're very clever . Yeah , I was clever when I was * like six . Dr Cormier , now that we 've met , you 'll need to sign a new confidentiality agreement . Would you leave us , please ? Yes , of course . So , you 're gay . My sexuality 's not the most interesting thing about me . How are you feeling ? These are the results of your last medical tests . What tests ? You visited your university GP two weeks ago . Blood tests . You have a high lymphocide count , along with high CRP and ESR . You were aware of Katja Obinger " s undiagnosed condition , yes ? - Yeah . - Here 's the data . Redacted to the pertinent . It 's in our best interests to eliminate genetic predisposition . Um , then you should let me examine the original genome . Oh , that 's not possible . Why not ? I assure you , the original DNA was robust . We believe RSUs stem from the cloning procedure . Dr Cormier will schedule you an MRI . And here 's something else I 'd like you to engage with . Here 's what little we know of Sarah Manning 's upbringing and environment . And here 's her sequenced genome . I want you to tell me why she 's different than we are . You mean , why she of all of us can have a child ? Do make yourself at home . ( MOBILE RINGING ) Our next driver confirming . Take it outside , please , Barry . Hold on a minute . Why does he need to take it outside ? So none of us know the details . It 's just the way it 's done , love . Oh , monkey . Hey , you sleepy , monkey ? You want to take a kip before we leave ? That 's a good idea . We 've got a really big trip ahead . Any goodbyes are just for now , okay ? Yeah . ( WHISPERING ) Okay , come on . Come on . Should I put my pyjamas on ? Depends what you have to tell me . What 's wrong ? What did you show Mrs S outside ? That . Why ? That 's Amelia 's . I saw it when she was snooping in her stuff . Why was Mrs S snooping in her stuff ? I bet Mrs S has loads of secrets . Some of them are good , yeah ? Maybe , but I don 't think so . - We should go . - Yeah . We 're on hold . If there 's trouble , I need to know . Barry ? Is there trouble ? - I 'm to make a call in an hour . - Usual delays . ( WHISPERING ) Here , get in . Barry , I 'd like to talk to the driver myself . You can 't . I 'm the contact . If we delay , we 'll be in daylight on the route with the most cameras . Well , we 'll change the route . Barry , I 'll call and get it sorted out . I think I 'd like to review it personally , Brenda . ( ENGINE SPUTTERING ) Stop ! Hands ! ( ENGINE REVS ) Sarah ! - Mommy ! - Get down ! What the hell are you doing ? For god 's sake , she 'sjust a little girl . We were all little girls once . Not like this one . Meaning what , exactly ? It means ... ( BRENDA SCREAMS ) Get out ! Get out of the truck or Kira will get hurt ! Open this door ! Sarah , I can 't let you go ! ( SARAH SCREAMS ) ( SCREAMS , GUNSHOT ) - Mommy ? - Stay down . Stay down ! Not my boy . Not my boy . Could you just tell me why ? After all we have been through together , why ? A lifetime of bluster about change and justice . While we starved for our troubles . Who got to you ? I found God . It turns out the Lord has deep pockets . You sold us to the Proletheans . Now you can tell me who are these cursed children you brought into our lives ? They 're Project LEDA . I don 't know what that is . Good . ( GUNSHOT ) ( MOBILE RINGING ) Bollocks . Alison ? It 's him . - Donnie took the Sarah bait . - What ? My husband is my monitor . Um , I need you to get me out of here before I snap . Oh , god , Alison , I 'm so sorry . I ... I can 't , I 'm leaving town for a while . Leaving ? Where ? I 'm going . I 'm going with Kira and Sarah , we ... Look , I want to tell you but it 's not safe to know . Even my own clones think I 'm useless . Oh , no , darling ! No , you , you have a musical to focus on . I killed Aynsley , Felix . Aynsley wore a scarf in the kitchen . Hang on just one second . Hi , Uncle Felix . Hey , monkey ! All right , Alison , I 'm really sorry but I 've got to go . - No . - I know ... Felix ? Call Cosima , don 't tip over , she 'll help you . And just play possum , okay ? I 'm sorry , Alison , I 've got to go . I 'm sorry . How 's Auntie Alison making out ? FELIX : You have got enough to worry about right now , okay ? You excited for our big adventure , monkey ? I don 't know . - Yeah , no , it 's going to be brilliant . - Absolutely . - Yeah . - No question . I can 't wait . Are we there yet ? 1400 acres supporting 40 souls . God smiles on you . Well , farmers pray more than most but ... It 's not worth a breath without hard work and basic biology . Agrosciences . Helena 's been with you for quite some time now , hasn 't she ? Since she was 12 years old . I wondered , Tomas , if you 've ever considered the fact that seeing as she 's a twin of a fertile clone , well , maybe ... Maybe Helena can conceive as well ? Impossible . She 's defective and dangerous . Any child of hers would be a monster . Well , you know her best . You know a wise man once said , " Science without religion is lame , " religion without science is blind . " Einstein didn 't believe in God . It 's a brand-new day . Why am I here ? My father says he wants you to join our family . - Who is that ? - They asked me to keep this videojournal . They found polyps on my lungs . We 're looking for a little girl in a custody case . MAN : They were here yesterday . - Do you live nearby ? - Yeah , B * lack Oak Drive . - Oh , Hilldale Crescent , I 'm Angie . - Alison . Ripped By mstoll

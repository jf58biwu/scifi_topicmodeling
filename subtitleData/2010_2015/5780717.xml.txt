 [ ship horn blows in distance ] I don 't understand why you won 't listen to me . It 's a splice overlap p.C.R. Reaction With an immune-modulatory gene . It will help the body identify the virus And create antibodies . Yes , yes . You are young and have a bright career ahead . And don 't waste your time with schoolboy science fiction . The virus is spreading . There are cases being reported beyond the middle east . It will be in oslo by winter . It is deadly and will likely mutate . We - - niels . I am well aware of what 's at stake . But what you are proposing is too dangerous . The australians tried it on mouse pox . It was a complete disaster . I 've already done the experiment . What ? On myself . While you were gone . And it worked . You are mad . I 'm still here . Absolutely mad . I 'm perfectly healthy . Professor lindblad , please . You stay away from my lab . You hear me ? I am finished with you ! Professor - - What was that ? Stubborn old man . Still living in the past . He still views you as his pupil . [ chuckles ] Someday the world will see you like I do . But only I get to be your wife . Now let 's eat . I have a plane to catch . [ clears throat ] oh , oslo to london , London to frankfurt , And if I don 't miss my connection , I have less than a day in rome . [ sighs ] too much travel . Mm . And I think I 'm coming down with something . I 've been taking these homeopathic immuno boosters . Jana swears by them . [ clears throat ] [ door opens ] You 'll be happy to know that the ship is finally repaired . Dr. Scott can 't have gone too far . We 'll find her again . Well , you 've found and lost her several times before . Forgive me for not getting my hopes up . If she were close to having a vaccine , where would she go ? Well , she would need animals to test it on - - Ones that are bigger than these . Like what ? [ mice squeak ] Monkeys . Closest place to here is puerto rico . No . Captain chandler would have wanted To get farther away from us . He must be somewhere else . [ switch clicks , electricity buzzes ] Central America , then . Can you be more specific ? No . [ door closes ] [ monkey squeals ] Remember I told you I discovered an extra gene on the virus ? All this time I 've been struggling To figure out where it came from . It turns out that it 's a human gene . Someone added a human gene to the virus ? Why ? I have no idea . No matter what I try , the virus seems to be One step ahead of me . It 's outsmarting whatever I throw at it . What 's worse , it 's made the original virus 10 times more lethal and virtually indestructible . How many monkeys you have left ? Three ? Two . [ indistinct conversations ] Hey . Afternoon . Hey , you really wanna listen to the same 50 songs For the rest of your life ? Okay , three kick-ass playlists for one granola bar . You ain 't gonna find a better deal than that . Don 't even think about it , Pete . Everybody knows miller 's got the lamest music . [ sighs ] all right , you get the goods . When I get mine . Done . Okay ? Yep . Thank you . It 's gonna take time , bro . [ sighs ] [ exhales , breathing heavily ] [ grunts ] [ breathing heavily ] [ door opens ] Heard you were up and about . I 'm doing great , sir . Mm . And your team ? Cruz is fully healed , Been whipping the new guys into shape while I 've been down . And , uh , I talked to cossetti . Hmm . He 's contrite , sir . Anxious to prove himself again . Good . Let 's get him out there soon as we can . That 'll help him win back some of the crew . Makes sense , sir . We didn 't wanna hit you with this Until you were back on your feet , but you 're aware that We 're punishing lieutenant foster . I am . We thought two weeks Double night watch would be good for you . Starting tonight . Yes , sir . And complete transparency as to why you 're being punished . It 's not enough that people know you broke the rules . They need to know why breaking the rules is dangerous . You should know , sir , I cut it off after that night . Doesn 't change a word I 've said . I just don 't want people to lose faith in me , sir . You 're a leader . Lead . Woman : I can 't believe how fast my little girl is growing . She 's started to roll onto her tummy , And she can almost sit up by herself now . Woman : But I think we 're gonna have to - - [ switch clicks ] Man : We 're in little rock . Uh , we do have a little bit of water , But we sure could use some more . Woman : ♪ this way ♪ that would take ... That 's marilyn . Palm beach . She was a bunny at the , uh , miami playboy club in the ' 60s . She puts on her own show every afternoon . [ chuckles ] She 's amazing . We have a good signal today . [ switch clicks ] Woman : [ caribbean accent ] please , is anyone out there ? I 'm on a fishing boat - - Too sad . I 'm going back to marilyn- - no . Wait . Stay there . My name is bertrise . Everyone else on my boat is dead . But I 'm not sick , I swear . I just need help . Please , I don 't have any food or water . Wayne . Get dr . Scott and the c.O. ... Won 't last much longer . I 'm scared . Please . Sir , she 's an 18-year-old girl from jamaica . She 's on a fishing boat off the coast of st . John point . I first logged her three weeks ago . There were 50 people on her boat . A week later , we heard her again . But then there were only 15 people left . And now she 's alone ? So if everyone on her boat has died from the virus And she 's the only one alive ... I mean , it could be that she 's naturally immune . You want us to find her ? No , I need you to find her . If I can take a look at her d.N.A. , I might figure out a way to beat this thing . Awfully convenient . You think it 's a trap ? I don 't know . How many immune people in the world ? Be incredibly rare , but of course they exist . Are you absolutely sure that it 's been this girl 's voice On the radio the entire time ? I know that voice . Gator ! Any idea where she might be ? I 've got four r.D.F. Bearings From some of her recent transmissions . 60 % confidence of her position within a 10-mile radius . Boat that size ... Still take hours to find her . If we found her at all . Sir , she 's all alone out there . She 's running out of water . We - - we don 't even know how much longer she 'll last . We have to reach out to her . Sir , if I may , breaking radio silence Will broadcast our bearing to anyone out there listening . And we are broadcasting . Bertrise ? Bertrise , you there ? [ static ] Bertrise ? Bertrise : Hello ? This is bertrise . Can you hear me ? Bertrise , this is joe brown . I 'm on a fishing boat . I might be in your area . Oh , my god . Are you talking to me ? Hello ? Now I need you to find the g.P.S. It 's a little computer screen with numbers on it . Okay . Uh , okay ... I know what it is . Can you read me those numbers ? It says 18 . Then 36.4 . And the letter " n . " 1-8 tack 3-6.4 north . Okay , bertrise , can you read me the next line of numbers ? 79 , 46.7 , w . Are you coming ? She 's approximately 280 miles north . Yes , bertrise , we 're coming to get you . Oh , thank you ! The - - the boat has a blue octopus painted on the side . Can you keep talking to me ? I gotta go now , bertrise , so we can come find you . Please don 't hang up . Hang tight . We 're on our way . Okay , we 're out . [ indistinct radio chatter ] Admiral ... [ speaking russian ] [ whirring ] [ indistinct p.A. Announcement ] Which boat are we in ? Doc hasn 't cleared me yet . So ride cobra two with lieutenant burk and his team . You got it . Good . You wanted to see me , sir ? I know you 've only been on my team for a couple weeks now , But everything you do reflects on me . And I 'm not gonna be out there today to cover your ass . I 'm aware , sir , that everybody 's doubting me . That I brought that on myself . But I will do the job . You know you took frankie benz 's spot . Now you can never fill those shoes And I don 't expect you to , but you 've gotta bring it . Every second of every day from here on in , Or I will find somebody else that will . I 'll bring it , sir . You 'll ride with captain in cobra one . Sir , uh ... Just wanted to tell you I appreciate this opportunity . I won 't let you down . Gear up then . Yes , sir . [ door clanks open ] [ motors revving ] Mason , monitor all stations . We need to hear everything that 's going on out there . Aye , sir . Remember , no transmissions . Nathan james does not transmit under any circumstance . Where are the beacons ? They 're not wearing any . We can 't risk anybody else picking up their location . [ speaking russian ] From 1835.20 north , 70946.12 west , Contact bears 3-2-0 . Sir , they 've located the boat . Put it on speaker . [ switch clicks ] Roger that , captain . All right , fellas , masks on . Stay frosty . Fan out . Search every inch of this boat . They 're boarding the octopus , sir . [ radio chatter ] Steady . Watch on 3 . We 're coming . Where is she ? [ muffled voice ] bertrise ! Nothing in the hole . Bertrise ! We 're not gonna hurt you ! Send security . To the left , left . Bertrise ! Search every inch of this boat ! Bertrise , we 're here to help you ! Bertrise ! Bertrise ! Search on the lower deck ! No sign of her , captain . Keep looking . She has to be somewhere . Tex , cossetti , come with me . Sir . U.S. Navy ! We 're here to help you ! They 're not here . [ door creaks ] Man : Bertrise ? [ water sloshing ] Bertrise ! You down here ? ! This does not feel right . [ water sloshing ] Whoa . Bertrise ! Are you down here ? ! There 's nothing but death down here . Captain , we got company . From where ? What direction ? You got something ? Negative , sir . Tower , c.I.C. I want that bird in the air . Now ! [ radio chatter ] [ helicopter blades whirring ] U-boats approaching . Fast off the starboard bow . All right , give me eyes ... [ speaking russian ] It 's the russians . Sons of bitches . You think they set us up ? Might not be anybody alive onboard . We don 't know that ! Keep looking ! Burk : Sir , we have 30 , maybe 40 seconds Before they 're in firing range . And we don 't know how many more are behind them ! [ woman crying ] bertrise ? Aah ! I found her ! They got her . You 're not fishermen . No , we 're the United States navy . We 're here to help you . Come on . We got her , captain ! We got her ! Let 's get her out of here ! Now ! Go , go , go !

Go to the 50 cal ! When I break hard to starboard , light ' em up ! Yeah , baby ! [ laughs ] We took a lot of hits . We 're sinking . And those other russians will be coming back for us . You dive ? [ static ] [ man speaking russian ] The girl 's boat is approximately here . Assuming the russians were coming from cuba Where we left them , Their ship should be somewhere in this region . And their attack boats were broadcasting from here . What am I doing here ? Your russian pals are back . Are you sure ? What have they said ? I don 't know what they said . I don 't speak russian . That 's why you 're here . You 're gonna sit down next to mason . Eavesdropping . You just listen . If you pick up anything on the u.H.F. , you translate . I 'm damn sure ruskov 's out there listening to us . You 'll tell me later what this is gonna cost me . I 'll do what you ask . When this is over , you make sure ruskov dies . We are 2-0 miles from last known point of contact . We have contact with a vessel at 11 : 00 , Half mile , bearing 0-5-0 . Burk : Saberhawk one , cobra two . How copy ? Over . Man : Solid copy , cobra two . Burk : We have the package . En route home base . Man : Account for personnel , cobra two . Burk : Besides the package , seven souls - - Burk , cruz , cossetti , jeter , dennison , rowler , walker . Man : Interrogative whiskey for cobra one ? Burk : We do not know their whiskey . Repeat , we do not know their whiskey . Be advised - - Two russian zodiacs in proximity to the octopus . Man : Solid copy . Saberhawk one eta overhead the octopus three mikes . Nathan james , we have negative beacon contact from this vessel . How far you think we are from that fishing boat ? With the currents ? Yeah . 10 miles , maybe 15 . [ panting ] I don 't know whether they picked up on our radio transmissions Or intercepted my call to bertrise . Either way , I 'm pretty sure they 're closer to us Than the nathan james is . Good thing we got beacons in those suits , right ? I took ' em off before we started In case the russians were around . Oh . Good plan . Well , you still got the radio ? Call for help . That 's a chance we got to take . What ? Do it . Do it ! Nathan james , this is cobra one . Sir , that 's the captain . Cease and desist all rescue operations . I say again , cease and desist any rescue operations . What the hell you doing ? That 's a direct order . What 's he talking about ? Ride off into the sunset with that package . It has been my sincere honor serving with you all . This will be my final transmission . [ static ] Please tell me that was some kind of a code . It wasn 't code . Oh , man . I mean , you gotta be kidding me . Right ? What was that ? You got a death wish . Nathan james sends a helo , The russians can hone in on it and track it back to the ship . I can 't allow that . Oh , great . So you 're martyring yourself . You 're taking me along for the ride . Thank you very much . I am sorry , tex . Sorry ! It was the proper command decision . It wasn 't worth the risk . They need you . No , they don 't . They need you ! Not worth the risk ! All right , so what is your plan ? Drown out here ? Or maybe we swim back to the octopus . Hang out with those fine people Till our eyeballs start bleeding out . There 's a reef . North , northeast of here . Start swimming . [ groans ] [ man shouting indistinctly in distance ] This is dr . Scott . She 's gonna take care of you now . It 's an absolute pleasure to meet you . Where 's captain chandler ? But you heard the captain 's orders , sir . What if it was a misdirect for the russians , In case they were listening ? I don 't think so . " ride off into the sunset " is what he said . We found the girl . Now he wants us to move forward . We can 't know that for sure . But you know him , and you know he 's right . Look , I know he wouldn 't leave any of us behind . Under normal circumstances , yes . Things are different now . Where 's lieutenant burk ? Uh , decon . The master chief ? Same . [ hand thuds ] We have no contact , And we have no idea where they went . They should still have radio . Captain ordered us to suspect rescue ops . He won 't give us the coordinates . W-why ? Because if the russians lock in on the helo , They can hone in on us once it comes home . The helo 's already launched so the x.O. ' s gonna take One shot at this before it has to refuel . Now I need you to think . Hard . What directions were the russians coming from ? Is there anything , Anything you can tell me that 'll help us narrow this down ? Think ! I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . [ classical music playing ] There are people starving to death in this world , And you refuse to eat ? Perhaps you 'd rather be back in the brig than dine with me ? Eat , darling . Please . May I suggest you explain to your daughter how lucky she is ? What more do you want from us ? How about a little gratitude ? Have I not provided for you , taken care of your needs ? And I think I 've taken care of yours in return . You have . [ utensil clinks ] But not with gratitude . [ speaking russian ] Woman : Saberhawk one , state fuel . Currently at 40 % . Nathan james , be advised , We 're also conducting ir sensor scan for sector . Man : Fly through , saberhawk one . Copy . Slattery : Lieutenant burk , over here . Where the hell are they ? [ static , radio chatter ] [ speaking russian ] Sir , I 'm picking up mobile bandwidth Low latency transmissions . Could be a u.A.V. Data link . Enable spy radar . But , sir , if the russians pick it up , They 'll track our bearing . You got 30 seconds , then we shut it down . Sir ? I gave an order . Aye , sir . [ beep ] [ droning in distance ] Do you hear that ? Sounds like a lawnmower . [ droning in distance ] It 's a u.A.V. Ours ? Theirs . Oh , boy . Suspect track 8-5-0-2-3 , bearing 3-5-1 . Range 3-8 miles . Heading south , southwest at 50 knots . Recommend kill track 8-5-0-2-3 . Roll f.I.S. Green . [ typing ] f.I.S. Is green . Killing track 8-5-0-2-3 with bird . Salvo size 1 . [ beeps ] [ whooshing ] Bird away track 8-5-0-2-3 . [ beeping ] [ blips ] [ droning grows louder ] Tell me that 's not a bomb . I 'm hoping it 's a camera . It 's getting awful close . Ha ha ! Oh , yeah ! Thank you , nathan james ! [ static ] [ speaks russian ] Mark delta . Right on target . Data link broadcast has been terminated , sir . Secure s.P.Y. Radar . [ keyboard keys click , beep ] He shouldn 't have done that . [ speaking russian ] [ helicopter blades whirring ] Man : Negative contact . Man : Beagle tower , this is saberhawk one . Dusk . Visibility dropping with the sun . [ pinging ] Beagle tower , this is saberhawk one . No sign of cobra team one in sector 7 . Heading to sector 8 . This is the last sample I 'll need While we wait for the results from your first test . I promise . You 're being very brave . I do apologize . I 'm the one who 's sorry . I made things so difficult for the soldiers That came to rescue me . After the virus came , There were many stories of men in suits like that with guns . We heard that they came to kill the sick people , Not to rescue them . [ alarm beeping ] Time to rest . [ groans ] [ exhales deeply ] Uh , how far do you figure to that reef ? Gator said it was roughly 20 miles from the octopus . Though ... He was only 60 % sure of that . Oh , good . [ groans ] Hey , do you think we 're getting anywhere ? Or do you think the waves are just knocking us back To where we started ? Unclear . Are you really this damn heroic Ordering off your own rescue ? You 're asking me if I 'm scared of dying ? I wasn 't thinking about it then , And it 's not gonna do me any good to think about it now . Hey , you wanna know somethin ' ? Only reason I came out here today Was to impress that doctor , rachel . [ laughs ] oh , you gotta be shitting me . Yeah ! I 'm sweet on her . You know ? You weren 't making a move . [ laughs ] Yeah ! Oh , my lord . You think she 's interested ? Get some rest , tex . Yeah . Oh , jesus . Hey , opposites attract , you know . Rachel : I was in negril once . My parents took me to the black cliffs To watch the jumpers . [ clatter ] Never seen anything quite like it . My father ran a hotel there . I helped him . It was a small place . Right on the beach . The sickness came first To the larger resorts in the north . Within a couple of weeks it was with us . We turned our hotel into a hospital . But ... After my mother died , My father took me and dominic away . Dominic 's your brother ? He died on the boat . I 'm so sorry . When we left jamaica , there were 51 . Within a couple of weeks , there were 15 . [ beeps ] And then there was just me . [ voice breaks ] why didn 't I die ? [ sighs ] Because you 're immune , bertrise ... To every single strain of the virus . So what does that mean ? It means we have a chance . [ helicopter blades whirring ] Visibility nil . Sunset approaching . We 'll switch to night vision . Saberhawk one diverting east . He may have called off the rescue , But he would never give up . There 's no chance , sir . What would you do if you were out there ? I 'd take my chances , swim back to the octopus . Could be russians . Well , all I know is , captain always has a plan . Gator . How far is that reef ? Approximately 20 miles from the octopus , sir . But from where they ended up , they could be even farther . Yeah , but it could be closer . Woman : Saberhawk one , State time left on station . Man : This is saberhawk one calling bingo now . Overhead in 2-0 mikes . They 're out of fuel . Then we hit that reef on the next pass , sir . You keep looking up there like it 's gonna change . It 's called navigating . It 's called drowning . It 's dark . We 're screwed . You said we 'd almost be there three hours ago . When did you become such a pessimist ? Cat 's only got nine lives . I already been through 12 or 13 of ' em . Why 'd you join the navy , anyway ? I joined the navy because of my father . He was navy , too ? Army . I did it to piss him off . [ laughs ] Well , you see how that worked out for you . Hey , don 't fall asleep . [ sputters ] I 'm just so relaxed . You never did tell me what part of texas you were from . Probably ' cause I 'm from reno . Huh . Hey , tex ? Yeah , boss ? I am afraid . To die ? To never see my wife . And my kids . I know what you 're doing . Playing it over and over again in your head . Every second , every moment . What you could 've done differently . I tripped . If I hadn 't , I 'd still be on the r.H.I.B. With them . Then you 'd be lost out there . And what good would that do us ? Maybe they wouldn 't be lost . Maybe I could 've done something . A thousand hours of training for five minutes of pure chaos . And then a thousand hours of second-guessing yourself . That 's the job ... For all of us . Man : Saberhawk one , final approach . Get her down and locked . [ speaks indistinctly ] Skin down . Woman : Roger , saberhawk one . I just came from the lab . The girl has a gene mutation that makes her immune . Dr. Scott injected her blood into the monkey and if it works , We may have the vaccine . Well , everybody did their job . The doctor is wondering if she can join us in here . She 's concerned about the captain and tex , obviously . X.O. , the russians are talking . [ man speaking russian ] They 're still searching the water . [ russian continues ] He thinks the americans have drowned . He thinks ? What exactly did he say ? Shh , shh . Do they have a body ? I don 't know . The radio keeps cutting in and out . I missed some of the words . Well , what words did you get ? They said " drowned . " I swear to god , if you 're lying to me , I will strap you to a torpedo . It 's what I heard . Sir , helo just landed . Standing by to refuel . We can 't trust anything we hear . The russians know we 're listening . They could be deliberately feeding us bad intel . Sir , if you mean to do this , Then I recommend we have a helo fly low zigzag To make it harder for someone to track it . That 'll burn a lot of fuel , sir . Yes , it will . But it means we 've got enough time To make one more short pass . I concur . Head for that reef . [ speaking russian ] Man : All stations report . I 'm on instruments On altitude 100 feet on air speed 90 knots . Negative contact . Man : Roger . Visibility nil . They 're out there . They 've got to be out there . Man : This is saberhawk one . We see something reflecting on the surface to the southwest . Taking a closer look . Over . Man : Dropping down to 90 feet . Roger . Right side , light chop . [ helicopter approaching ] You hear that ? ! Hey ! Hey ! We 're here ! We 're here ! Don 't tell me , you 're pissed at slattery now ? Son of a bitch . Man : In sight , engaging automatic approach , Standby to lower the harness . Roger . [ pinging ] [ blades whirring ] Yeah ! Aah ! Whoo ! You first ! Not a chance ! You first , captain ! I insist ! [ helicopter blades whirring ] What is that ? What the hell ? It 's not them . Man : Roger . No sign of survivors . Come on . [ speaks russian ]

AND THE SCORCHING HEAT OF THE AFRICAN DESERT ... WILDFORD 'S MIRACLE TRAIN IS SELF-SUSTAINING ... AND POSSESSES THE MOST SOPHISTICATED DESIGN ... AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY KNOWN ... AS HARD AS IT IS TO BELIEVE ... PEOPLE IN THE OLD WORLD MADE FUN OF MR. WILFORD . THEY CRITICIZED HIM FOR OVER-ENGINEERING ... AND OVER-EQUIPPING THIS WONDERFUL TRAIN . BUT MR. WILFORD KNEW SOMETHING THEY DID NOT . AND WHAT WAS THAT ? OLD WORLD PEOPLE WERE FRIGGING MORONS WHO GOT TURNED INTO POPSICLES . SORT OF . MR. WILFORD KNEW THAT CW-7 WOULD FREEZE THE WORLD .

DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT WENT ON BACK THERE ? WHEN WE BOARDED ? IT WAS CHAOS . BUT WE DIDN 'T HAVE TIME TO BE THANKFUL . WILFORD 'S SOLDIERS CAME AND THEY TOOK EVERYTHING . IT 'S A THOUSAND PEOPLE IN AN IRON BOX ... NO WATER . WE ATE THE WEAK . YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE ABOUT MYSELF ? I KNOW WHAT PEOPLE TASTE LIKE . I KNOW THAT BABIES TASTE BEST . THERE WAS A WOMAN . SHE WAS HIDING WITH HER BABY . AND SOME MEN WITH KNIVES CAME . THEY KILLED HER AND THEY TOOK HER BABY . AND THEN AN OLD MAN ... JUST ... AN OLD MAN . GIVE ME THE KNIFE . AND EVERYONE THOUGHT HE 'D KILL THE BABY HIMSELF . BUT HE TOOK THE KNIFE ... AND HE CUT OUT HIS OWN ARM ... EAT THIS . IF YOU 'RE SO HUNGRY ... EAT THIS . JUST LEAVE THE BABY .

I KILLED EDGAR 'S MOTHER . OTHER PEOPLE IN THE TAIL SECTION STARTED ... CUTTING ARMS AND LEGS AND OFFERING THEM . IT WAS LIKE A MIRACLE . AND I WANTED TO ... I TRIED . I JUST ... WILFORD 'S SOLDIERS BROUGHT THOSE PROTEIN BLOCKS . WE 'VE BEEN EATING THAT SHIT EVER SINCE . 18 YEARS I 'VE HATED WILFORD . 18 YEARS I 'VE WAITED FOR THIS MOMENT . AND NOW I 'M HERE . OPEN THE GATE . PLEASE . CURTIS . BUT I DON 'T WANT TO OPEN THIS DOOR . YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT ? I WANT TO OPEN A DOOR . BUT NOT THIS ONE . THAT ONE . THAT ONE THAT LEADS TO THE OUTSIDE . WE 'VE BEEN SENTENCED HERE FOR 18 YEARS . EVERYONE THINKS IT 'S A WALL . BUT IT 'S A FUCKING DOOR . OPEN IT AND GET US OUT OF HERE . FUCKING CRAZY ? I KNOW ... BUT MAYBE WE CAN SURVIVE . YOU REMEMBER YEKATERINA BRIDGE ? WHEN WE GOT SLAUGHTERED WITH AXES ? I CHECK SOMETHING . WE SEE THE WRECKAGE OF A PLANE ... UNDER THE SNOW . FOR TEN YEARS THE TAIL COULD BARELY BE SEEN . BUT NOW I CAN SEE THE FUSELAGE AND WINGS . THERE IS LESS AND LESS SNOW AND ICE . IT MELTS . SNOW BECOMES MORE FRAGILE . IT DOESN 'T TAKE MUCH TO GET RID OF EVERYTHING . YOU KNOW WHAT I SAW ? THERE WERE ... RAIN DROPS . I 'M WASTING MY BREATH TELLING YOU THIS . YOU GOTTA TAKE IT EASY ON THAT KRONOLE . THAT FLAMMABLE SHIT 'S GONNA FRY YOUR BRAIN . YOU DON 'T THINK I 'M RIGHT .

TAKE THAT OFF THE DOOR . FIRE ! CURTIS EVERETT . I 'VE BEEN ASKED TO EXTEND A FORMAL INVITATION ... FROM MR. WILFORD TO JOIN HIM FOR DINNER . AFTER YOU . CURTIS ? IS THAT YOU ? DEAR BOY ... COME IN . LET 'S TAKE A LOOK AT YOU . YOU HUNGRY ? COMING ALL THIS WAY . SIT DOWN . YOU ARE THE FIRST HUMAN BEING TO HAVE WALKED THE TOTAL LENGTH OF THIS TRAIN . TAIL TO ENGINE . DID YOU KNOW THAT ? WELL DONE . BRAVO . TO THE ENGINE . I 'VE NEVER BEEN TO THE TAIL SECTION . WHY NOT ? TOO DIRTY FOR YOU ? DON 'T WANT TO RUB AGAINST THE VERMIN OF THE TAIL SECTION ? DO YOU THINK MY STATION IS WITHOUT IT 'S OWN DRAWBACKS ? IT 'S NOISY . AND IT 'S LONELY . RIGHT . STEAKS . PLENTY OF ROOM . THIS WHORE TO BRING YOU ANYTHING YOU WANT . EVERYONE HAS THEIR PREORDAINED POSITION . AND EVERYONE IS IN THEIR PLACE EXCEPT YOU . THAT 'S WHAT PEOPLE IN THE BEST PLACE SAY TO THE PEOPLE IN THE WORST PLACE . THERE 'S NOT A SOUL ON THIS TRAIN THAT WOULDN 'T TRADE PLACES WITH YOU . WOULD YOU TRADE PLACES WITH ME ? FUCK YOU . DEAR BOY . THE FACT IS THAT WE ARE ALL STUCK INSIDE THIS BLASTED TRAIN . WE ARE ALL PRISONERS IN THIS HUNK OF METAL . MEDIUM RARE ? AND THIS TRAIN IS A CLOSED ECOSYSTEM . WE MUST ALWAYS STRIVE FOR BALANCE . AND POPULATION ... MUST ALWAYS BE KEPT IN BALANCE . HOWEVER THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN MORE ... RADICAL SOLUTIONS WERE REQUIRED . RATHER ... DRASTICALLY . WE DON 'T HAVE TIME FOR TRUE NATURAL SELECTION . WE WOULD ALL BE HIDEOUSLY OVERCROWDED AND STARVE WAITING FOR THAT . THE NEXT BEST SOLUTION ... IS TO HAVE INDIVIDUAL UNITS KILL OFF OTHER INDIVIDUAL UNITS . SO TO SPEAK . THE MCGREGOR RIOTS ... THE GREAT CURTIS REVOLUTION . A BLOCKBUSTER PRODUCTION WITH A DEVILISHLY UNPREDICTABLE PLOT . WHO COULD HAVE PREDICTED YOUR COUNTERATTACK WITH THE TORCH IN THE YAKETERINA TUNNEL ? PURE GENIUS . THAT WASN 'T WHAT GILLIAM AND I HAD IN OUR PLAN . WHAT ? WELL DON 'T TELL ME YOU DIDN 'T KNOW . GILLIAM AND I ... OUR PLAN . GILLIAM ? GILLIAM . THE FRONT AND THE TAIL ARE SUPPOSED TO WORK TOGETHER . REALLY . HE WAS MY FRIEND . BULLSHIT . I DON 'T BELIEVE YOU . OUR ORIGINAL AGREEMENT WAS FOR THE INSURGENCY TO END AT THE YAKETERINA TUNNEL . AND ALL THE SURVIVORS WOULD GO BACK TO THE TAIL SECTION ... - TO ENJOY MUCH MORE SPACE . - YOU 'RE A FUCKING LIAR . GILLIAM WOULD NEVER DO THAT . IT ALL WORKED OUT IN THE END . YOUR COUNTERATTACK ACTUALLY MADE THE INSURGENCY 10 TIMES MORE EXCITING . UNFORTUNATELY THE FRONT SUFFERED MORE LOSSES THAN ANTICIPATED AND ... GILLIAM HAD TO PAY THE PRICE . ISN 'T IT ? HOW PEOPLE DRAMATICALLY CROSS THAT THIN BARRIER BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH . NOW THERE 'S JUST ONE LAST THING FOR US TO DO . TALLY UP THE NUMBERS . WILFORD . IT 'S ME . I 'M AT GILLIAM 'S PLACE . HOLD ON . IS IT STILL THE SAME NUMBER ? YES . IT STILL STANDS AT 74 % . CARRY ON . WAIT . TO CELEBRATE OUR 18TH YEAR . IT 'S AN EXCELLENT IDEA . YES . YOUR PEOPLE . GODDAMMIT CLAUDE ! MIND THE ENGINE ! SHE 'S GETTING SENSITIVE RECENTLY . SIT DOWN AND MIND YOUR TABLE MANNERS . JUST RELAX . CALM DOWN . BUT ALWAYS SO TENSE . WHEN 'S THE LAST TIME YOU GOT LAID ? HOLDING A WOMAN IS MUCH BETTER WITH TWO ARMS . I 'LL MISS GILLIAM . I 'LL MISS OUR LATE NIGHT PHONE CHATS . HE COULD GO ON FOR HOURS . ALL WITH ONLY ONE ARM . WHAT 'S WITH THAT FACE ? WHAT 'S THE MATTER ? YOU LOOK LIKE A CRAZY PERSON . AS IF THERE AREN 'T ENOUGH CRAZIES ON THIS TRAIN . BLOOD ! ARE YOU OKAY ? WHAT ? WHAT HAPPENED ? GET DOWN . YONA ... WE MUST OPEN THIS DOOR . YOU SEE THOSE CABLES ? THERE ARE SO MANY CABLES . DIE ! BASTARD ! I BELIEVE IT IS EASIER FOR SOMEONE TO SURVIVE ON THIS TRAIN ... IF THEY HAVE SOME LEVEL OF INSANITY . AND AS GILLIAM WELL UNDERSTOOD ... WE NEED TO MAINTAIN A PROPER BALANCE OF ANXIETY AND FEAR ... CHAOS AND HORROR IN ORDER TO KEEP LIFE GOING . WE NEED TO INVENT IT . THE GREAT CURTIS REVOLUTION YOU INVENTED WAS TRULY A MASTERPIECE . YONA . NUMBER 8 . 7 . CURTIS . THERE 'S SOMETHING I WANT TO SHOW YOU . YOU DESERVE IT . COME ON . SHE 'S WAKING UP NOW . YES ? PEACEFUL . YOU ARE NOW IN HER HEART . I 'VE DEVOTED MY ENTIRE LIFE TO THIS . THE ETERNAL ENGINE . IT IS ETERNITY ITSELF . HAVE YOU EVER BEEN ALONE ON THIS TRAIN ? WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU WERE ALONE ? CAN YOU ? SO PLEASE DO . TAKE YOUR TIME . I JUST WROTE IT . CURTIS . HERE . I AM OLD . I WANT YOU TO TAKE MY STATION . IT 'S WHAT YOU ALWAYS WANTED . IT 'S WHAT GILLIAM WANTED TOO . YOU MUST TEND THE ENGINE ... KEEP HER HUMMING . CURTIS . BEYOND THE GATE ... PRECISELY WHERE THEY 'VE ALWAYS BEEN AND WHERE THEY 'LL ALWAYS BE . ALL ADDING UP TO WHAT ? THE TRAIN . AND NOW THE PERFECTLY CORRECT NUMBER OF HUMAN BEINGS ... ALL ADDING UP TO WHAT ? HUMANITY . THE TRAIN IS THE WORLD . WE THE HUMANITY . AND NOW YOU HAVE THE SACRED RESPONSIBILITY TO LEAD ALL OF HUMANITY . HUMANITY WILL CEASE TO EXIST . YOU 'VE SEEN WHAT PEOPLE DO WITHOUT LEADERSHIP . THEY DEVOUR ONE ANOTHER . THE KRONOLE ! STOP ! - NO . NO BULLETS ? STICK THE KRONOLE ON THE DOOR . LOOK AT THEM . THAT 'S HOW PEOPLE ARE . YOU KNOW . YOU 'VE SEEN THIS . YOU 'VE BEEN THIS . AREN 'T THEY ? YOU CAN SAVE THEM FROM THEMSELVES . THIS IS WHAT GILLIAM SAVED YOU FOR . CURTIS . THIS IS YOUR DESTINY . IT 'S DONE ! CURTIS HAS THE MATCHES . GO GET THEM ! CURTIS ! THE MATCHES ! THE SPACE ONLY ALLOWS FOR A VERY SMALL PERSON . YOUNG CHILDREN UNDER 5 . BUT NOT SO ALL OF ITS PARTS . THAT PIECE OF EQUIPMENT WENT EXTINCT RECENTLY . WE NEEDED A REPLACEMENT . THANK GOODNESS THE TAIL SECTION MANUFACTURES A STEADY SUPPLY OF KIDS . SO WE CAN KEEP GOING MANUALLY . YOU FUCKING BASTARD ! YONA ... TAKE THE FIRE . LIGHT THE FUSE ! MANUAL REACTOR SHUTING DOWN . OKAY ... PLEASE STAND AT SAFE DISTANCE . MANUAL REACTOR CHECK IN PROGRESS . ANDY ? IS THAT YOU ? ANDY ! DO YOU REMEMBER ME ? STOP ! LISTEN TO ME . DON 'T GO UP THOSE STAIRS . LISTEN ! ANDY ! COME HERE . COME OVER HERE . LISTEN TO ME ! GET OUT OF THERE ! ANDY ! LISTEN TO ME . DON 'T BE SO MELODRAMATIC . YOU KNOW EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN PREORDAINED POSITION . NICE . DAD ... DAD ... DAD !

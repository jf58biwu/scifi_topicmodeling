Got it ? I didn 't hire you for stupid ideas I hired you because of your Midas ' touch . Now my polls are in the toilet and the election is just weeks away . You dropped the ball , Vivian ! You ! Now , I need a miracle . Get me a miracle ! Actually , how was sending those two astronauts to the moon supposed to get me reelected , exactly ? We haven 't been to the moon for 50 years . One of them was black . - Thought it would look good . - Look good how ? Like I said , one of them was black . Just think of the opportunity we wasted years ago with that errand boy , Powell , Alan Powell ? - Colin Powell . - That was close . - And where are you going ? - The UN , to do my job " The Great Dictator " by Charlie Chaplin . It is one of the world 's most famous short films . which illustrates in just ten minutes his wish that one day , the entire world will be held in the great Führer 's wise and gentle hands . - Any questions ? - I have a question . In my classroom we adhere to a strictly formal manner of addressing one another . To what do we owe the honor of this visit ? - We capture an earthling . - Your expertise is required . Hey , sauerkraut . I love sauerkraut . And Volkswagen . Huh ... Fahrvergnügen . ( Driving pleasure . ) Hey ! German words , right ? You know , it 's as if , where I come from we speak German too .

That is the air lock ... No ! You might wanna ... cover up a bit . All good ? I know a lot of important people . I even know the President of the United States of America .

This is a computer . No , " dat 's " ancient history , homie . I am telling you once again ... One moment we received conformation that the ship has landed successfully on the moon . The next , all communication stopped . - As though it had simply vanished . - Or you 're hiding something from us ? Yeah , we are hiding something on the dark side of the moon . I still find it very difficult to believe that the entire purpose of the mission to promote your president 's reelection . Well , believe what you like , we 've had mere senators spend hundreds of millions on campaigns to get elected to dog-shit posts . But Mr Secretary , the expenses involved this time only makes sense if there was a military purpose . Okay , let 's get this clear . The United States has no military activity on the moon What about natural resources activity ? We know how the US sometimes mixes the two up . - Is there any chance that you are looking for Helium-3 up there ? Helium-3 ? You just made that up , didn 't you ? That 's so silly . I assume these are just preliminary ideas ? Sir , we had a very small delivery window . - Sir ? - Yes , sir . Ma 'am , and this is all . Anyone who is not a head of a department , should leave . You idiots ! You morons ! That 's an insult to morons . What is this shit ? I have a meeting with the President of the United fucking States of America tomorrow fucking morning !

Come on now please , you have met a brother before , right ? - No , I 'm an only child . - No , no . I didn 't mean like that . I meant a black man . No , and this continues to confuse me because you are much blacker then when I first encountered you . Okay girl , look either i 'm black or you 're blind . Look , what is going to happen to me ? I mean , what with this guy keep sticking needles in me ? - What about that other angry dude ? - My father sticking needles into you ? That freaking scientist guy ? That your dad ?

Klaus , baby I coming to get ya ' . - What the hell is this place ? - This is the Götterdämmerung . It will liberate the earth . Actually , it 's the biggest war machine ever created by man . - This is the bridge . That 's where I 'm going . - I need to find your father , so ... - Where do you think he at ? - I think you will find him over there Try to sneak in , and please paralyze the engines . - Or otherwise the earth is destroyed . - Note to self , paralyze the engine . Got it . Oh ! No , no no . You be careful - I mean , you know ... - What ? - Because you like me . - Right ... Oh , come on , a little . I mean ... You like me ... . We have a visual on the Nazi fortress , commander . Obvious and overstated as usual , Klaus . Alright , everyone , let 's get those nukes in action . - I 'm declaring this fortress a free-fire-zone . - But Commander , there are women and children down there . The United States of America does not negotiate with terrorists . - Prime warheads on secondary armament . - Roger that . - Prepare all available ordinance for ground bombardment . - Fire the fucking nukes ! Nukes away . Job well done . Remember me ? The Moon spook you turned into a snowflake . Oh shit , it 's alive . He must have the smallest dick in the universe . Time ... to fuck back . Everyone , take positions around this fat phallus and wait for my command to open fire . - Offensive run confirmed . - Let her rip . - Washington , do you hear me ? Washington ? - Renate , was that you ? - You need to shut down the engine . - I 'm working on it . Congratulations . High five . Well , that was disappointing . Do you think he suffered ? Even just a little ? Vivian , I knew you could do it . You 're foxy and salacious , all the way . Congratulations . - What 's Helium-3 ? - Helium . Did you say Helium-3 ? Yes , there is like about 15 to 20 giant towers that appear to be full of this stuff . - That 's ours . - It is ? Why ? Helium-3 would make the U.S. independent of all energy needs for the next thousand years . Yes , it 's ours . No , no , no . Hear me out . Hear me out . The moon is American soil . Moon flag , star and stripes . Who beat the Moon Nazis ? We did . Well , yeah yeah , alright , you helped out here and there , but ultimately it 's just like World War II ... and who won that ? We did - You lie . - You don 't believe me ? Watch the movies . Movies don 't lie . Not the shoe , Jesus . Vivian , this is the Secretary of Defense . - Defend and hold that Helium-3 at all costs . - But against who ? Against everybody ! Unfortunately that 's the story of revenge . It 's messy . Never really works out the way you wanted to . I feel lonely . The eternal love of God , the love of God into our hearts , or we will burn ... burn in hell , burning in eternal damnation . Renate . Washington . You 're alive ! You are alive ! It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . And you are the way you 're meant to be . Are you aware that you are kissing a black man ? I guess we have a lot of work cut out for us .

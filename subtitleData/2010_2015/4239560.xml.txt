 This is what Destiny intended from the moment it entered the system . We are going to survive , we are going to make it home . Ths ship came here for a reason ! Destiny is powered by the stars themselves . He and Young are bumping heads . Not sure which camp is the better choice . We pretend nothing happened . We need to be ready for the next encounter ... For the sake of the crew . For the sake of the crew . They 're coming . Who 's coming ? The Lucian alliance , they want Destiny . They can open the doors ! - Take cover ! - Grenade ! Fall back ! - You 'll be okay . - What happened ? You were shot . You are surrounded . Lay down your weapons or we will vent the entire compartment to space . - Can they do it ? - Yes . Then they should have . Wait ! We will not be complying with your request to surrender . We have 12 missing and presumed captured including Riley , TJ , Chloe and Eli . I 'm going to save every one of those hostages and I 'm going to retake this ship . Do you understand me ? We 've got the medical supplies you requested . We are prepared to give them to you as a show of good faith . Thank you . One condition : you and I meet to make the exchange . Agreed . Let 's do this . Ready . Now , remember : quick kills , centre mass . All right . You ready to do this ? We 're ready . Bring the medic . Open the door . I 'm in . - Who is this ? - Ronald Greer is also a medic . Another offer of good faith ? In exchange for Lt. Johansen . First things first . Go and check the supplies and see they 're what you need . - Hold your fire ! - Don 't shoot ! - Power went out throughout the ship . - I can see that . Please step aside . - Get behind me . - She takes one step in your direction , - and I will shoot her myself . - I 've got the shot , sir . My men have been ordered to execute the prisoners if I am killed . Step back in my direction . Sir , I 've got the shot . Stand down , Sergeant . Damn it ! - What happened ? - They surprised us ? What do you mean ? They surprised us ! Do you want me to explain it again ? Hostages are useless if they are dead . At least they serve a purpose ! Tell them . Tell them . I 'm here . She just killed Rivers . Understood . Don 't fall asleep . It 's dangerous . That 's a concussion . It 's boring . So what do you think they 'll do with them ? Who ? The prisoners . Probably drop them off on some planet . I don 't know . I just hope everyone 's okay . I just hope it 's over . Not much we can do about it . Rest time is over . This feels familiar . - What the hell just happened ? - We still don 't know . We 're just getting systems back online . - Maybe we can analyse . - Screw analyze ! Fix it ! - Got to know what 's broken ... - Do it now ! Rivers ... - is dead . - What ? It was going to be someone . Would you prefer it was Chloe or Eli ? Lt. Johansen perhaps ? You were thinking the same thing ! Figure out what 's wrong with the ship and fix it , fix it now . I have orders to help . What 's your name ? Koz . I 'll let you know what I need . You do know there is a way to save them . - You 're just not wired to consider it . - I 'm not surrendering this ship . What exactly is so wonderful about it ? We give up , she kills everyone except for those who have value to her . And let me tell you , that 's not a hell of a lot of people . - This is Young . - I 'd like to speak to the civilian . Colonel Young has proved that he cannot be trusted . Can you ? Then why did you let them plan an ambush ? I voiced my disagreement . And you could not stop them . Obviously not . For that , one of your men was killed . If you fail to live up to your promise twice ... I will kill again . Do you understand ? No , I don 't understand , but I do believe you . Then I would like to take you up on your initial offer ... with one modification : four of your men for four of ours , and food and water for three days . Will food and water be offered to the hostages ? They 're no good to me dead . Then we 're agreed . Next time we take supplies with us in the first wave . If there is a next time . Damn it ! Flashlight ! - What 's happening ? - I don 't know , I 'm up to my wrists in someone 's body right now . Do we have any answers yet ? Just the one . Every crash has been exactly 46 minutes , 37.4 seconds apart . So ? It 'll be easier to show you . What am I looking at ? That 's our problem . It 's a binary pulsar . It 's the combination of a rotating neutron star and probably a white dwarf orbiting around a single point in space . What does that mean to us ? Pulsars give off gamma radiation and X-rays as they rotate , short deadly bursts of ionized radiation . The shield and the hull protect us right now . But the pulsar is literally feeding off of the white dwarf , stripping off material and creating an accretion disc . White dwarf ploughs through that material every orbit ... Which gives off an even bigger gamma ray burst on top of what we 're already getting hit with . That 's why our systems are shutting down . The shield has to draw extra power in order to compensate . And that happens every 46 minutes 37.4 seconds . It 's what 's killed that man . And it 's going to be what kills us . The Lucian Alliance just dialed in when the damn thing was in range . Destiny had to drop out of FTL to make the connection . - It 's bad timing , bad luck . - Then why are we still here ? Our FTL capability 's been compromised . Don 't yell . We don 't know why yet . The shield is what 's keeping us alive . But sooner or later it 's going to fail . - When it does ... - We 're dead . The radiation burst is what 's causing the system malfunctions . Which will only get worse . Because the shield will fail eventually , yes . Unless we can find a way to make the jump to FTL . - How much time ? - According to Rush , we can withstand two more bursts . People will start dying by the third . We saw what one of those bursts did to a man when he wasn 't protected by the ship 's hull . First we 'll make the trade and then we 'll discuss this new problem . Has their medic completed Varro 's surgery ? Not yet . - Then , find out what 's taking so long . - I 'll do it . She told me to check on your progress . Tell her it 'd be a lot faster if the lights didn 't keep going off . That 's a whole other problem . The Destiny came out of FTL within range of a pulsar . Time is short before the shield fails . - Crewman Young and his men are on it ... - She won 't let them . I 'll do my best to convince her . You do that . We 've got the supplies that they requested and we 're ready to make the prisoner exchange . Copy that . I 'm fine . I 'm fine . And Varro ? I 've done all I can for him . Will he live ? I got the bullet out and stopped the bleeding so he should have a chance . I 'd like to take a look at the other wounded . Fine . Let 's go . You got it ? What 's this ? A flak vest ... just in case . How can I expect them to trust me if I can 't even demonstrate a willingness to trust them in turn ? With all due respect , ma 'am , I don 't think they can be trusted . You tell Colonel Young I appreciate his concern . Colonel said you wouldn 't take it . I just thought I 'd try . Are you sure about this , sir ? Good enough for me . Hope you make a better impression than I did . Commander Kiva , are you ready ? We are . Brody , open it . Thank you . I 'll take it from here . I asked for civilians . These are the two we had . We agreed on four for four . Four . What about Lt. Johansen ? She stays . Even if we figure out a way to jump back into FTL ... and right now the odds are not good ... Then we 're right back where we started . But this doesn 't have to end with one of us losing . If we could just figure out a way to work with each other ... I can see you 're someone who enjoys talking through problems . But if you don 't solve this new one then neither of us will have anything to talk about . Alright , get in the infirmary . Where 's Chloe and Eli ? She said they were the only two civilians . Then where the hell are they ? Now , if we could just ... Sorry . Sorry ! Take a break , Eli . Have to be getting close by now . You know what ? We should do this twice a week . This is the kind of exercise that really motivates me : carrying a wounded person the length of the whole ship in low oxygen . Good times . Thank you , Eli . Now it 's your turn to carry me . You 're an amazing friend . You can never have too many of those . Unless you 're one of those people on Facebook who just accepts everybody 's friend request . It 's like , come on , you know , be a little selective . Damn it ! Sorry . Sorry ! It 's okay . Are you okay ? I 'm okay . Sorry . Okay , thanks . There 's no sign of Eli or Chloe . Maybe they 're ... There 's no fatalities on our side except for Rivers . They must be hiding somewhere . I hope so . That boy would take a bullet before he let them touch a hair on her head . Don 't get distracted . I 'm not . I 'm not . I just ... I want to get this done with . And I wish Colonel would give the word so we can go in there and properly resolve the situation . Look , he 'll do the right thing when the right time comes . You 've got to trust that . 100 % . I don 't know how you do it , man . Then you need to learn . Thank you . Your commander already showed her appreciation by not killing me . It must be difficult to be forced to save the life of your enemy . I would have done it anyway . - How 's the pain ? - Bearable . - Look , I 'm trying to say ... - I don 't really care . I 've been on my feet for far too long and I have other patients . So , excuse me . Conserving air or unconscious ? Just thinking . About what ? I used to think I had a lot of friends . But I don 't . They 're a billion light-years away but they 're still your friends . They don 't really care about me . And I don 't really care about them either . That 's nice . Because until I met you , I didn 't really know what a friend was . Do you know what I mean , Eli ? A friend is someone who will support you no matter what . Like you . Why don 't we ... I am not just saying that because I feel like I 'm going to pass out . And even if I do , I just want to say it first . And you did , so ... Whenever I say stuff like that to you , you always react like I 've just awarded you some runner-up prize . And it 's not . Yeah , I know . It 's just that ... I know . Of course you do . There 's a console over there . I didn 't notice that when we came in . And it 's got power . Can you call for help ? I can try . Dr. Park . Look . It 's not much of a solution but we don 't have to shield the entire ship . Just the side facing the pulsar array . We 'll have to leave shielding on the underside but we could transfer something like 90 % . It should buy us enough time to restore FTL capability . So , why haven 't you guys done it yet ? Because it can 't be done from inside the ship . It could if we controlled the core systems , but ... Look , someone is going to have to go for a walk . I can tell you where to go , what to do . The mechanics of it are relatively simple . Then why don 't you put on a spacesuit and do it ? Well , you get the FTL drive back online while I 'm gone and you 've got a deal . - We 'll get it done , sir . - I know you will . Gear up . They have only the time between the gamma ray bursts to complete their work . The next one is less than 20 minutes from now so obviously time is an issue . So what do you need from us ? There 's a hull breach in the access corridor that 's under your control . It 's the exit point closest to the array . We need you to let us in . Transfer control of all the ship 's systems to us and we will let them in . You do understand that if you don 't help us save the ship we will all die . I understand completely . And I want you to transfer the ship 's systems to us . When was the last time you ran a security sweep in there ? Never mind . I 'll do it . Radio . Calvos , this is Telford . Give me access to the damaged section . You tell me . You think she 's bluffing ? She doesn 't have to . She knows who she 's dealing with . But to be fair , you don 't have much of a choice . At least they 'll keep some of us alive for a while anyway . Yeah , like you . You forget I 've recently been in their employment . I wouldn 't envy me just yet . It 's about damn time . Listen , do it . Transfer control of the ship and surrender yourselves . Everyone but Rush and Brody . Have them retreat to one of the auxiliary control rooms . They 're gonna notice Rush is missing . Tell them he panicked and ran away . They 'll be looking for him to late . At the first available opportunity , I 'll access one of the gateroom consoles and transfer control of the ship back to Rush . The second they find out , they 're gonna start shooting prisoners . They won 't find out . Not right away , anyway . I won 't lock them out completely . They can have control of the ship until I decide they can 't . They 'll herd all of the prisoners into one compartment . If they don 't , I 'll suggest it . When they do , I 'll contact Rush on this channel , I 'll tell him in which compartment he can vent the atmosphere . And you ? You let me worry about that . I got to go . It 's all clear . Best not to stick around . This is Young . I am prepared to surrender control of this ship provided certain conditions are met . Go ahead . I need you to guarantee me the safety of my people . Agreed . Nobody gets hurt during the changeover , and no retribution afterwards . Anything else ? That 's all . Well , Mr. Brody , time to panic and run off . Hold on a sec . We just got a message from an unexplored part of the ship . It 's Eli . What do we do ? Well , you got to go . Good luck . Yeah , you too . Transfer control to them . Anything ? I wrote it in ancient , so it could take a while to ... What is it ? We got a message . What 's it say ? We 'd better stay put . Transfer complete . Open them . No shooting . That 's a good sign . I think the stitching is torn . You 're moving around too much . I understand your anger at losing the ship , but it wasn 't yours to begin with . When all this is settled , sins will have to be forgiven . Truce ? Open them . 46 minutes , gentlemen . They 're in . Attenuating the shield strength . Dialing back artificial gravity . A power relay just went down . Something wrong ? We lost a power relay . Then why aren 't you dealing with it ? Go . I can open and close doors . - This is it ? - It 's where he said it was going to be . - What happened ? - The transfers just stopped . What 's the matter ? It won 't lock . Colonel Young , this is Scott . How are we doing for time ? 14 minutes . This is Calvos . Kiva and Telford have both been shot . The commander is still breathing but unconscious . Get them to the medic . Yes , sir . - Any sign of the enemy ? - None . Where are your men ? How did they get into the gateroom ? I don 't know what the hell you 're talking about . I 've got people outside this ship ! The enemy has somehow breached our lines . Both Telford and Kiva have been shot . I 'm assuming command . Colonel Young , this is Scott . Ready to come back in . Lower the shield . I repeat , this is Scott , over . The shield is still up . We cannot get back inside . They just saved our lives . Lower the shield . - Keep moving . - Lower the damn shield ! Lower the shield . Try a different channel ! This is Scott . Please respond ! Something 's gone wrong . We have to find you another way . There 's no time for that , Rush ! What other way is there ? - An airlock in the forward section . - We think . It 's in a totally unexplored part of the ship . Besides , we can 't open it from here . I need you to head back towards the front of the ship . Negative , negative ! Listen , that 's the way in . We 're looking at the way in right now . You need to go there as quickly as you can . We 're on our way . What 's going on ? - I 'm getting a message . - What 's it say ? - That I gotta go . - What do you mean ? I 'm telling them where you are , so you 'll be safe until they come . Where are you going ? Whatever happens , you know , right ? You 're scaring me . I gotta go . What happened ? Come on ... Separate the civilians . Take them to another compartment . What are you doing ? I 'm going to put an end to this . Bring their injured soldiers to me . Not if you expect me to save your commander . They 're not going to make it .

 It 's time . You have to decide . It 's the only way . Only you can give the order . 'Dude , make it quick . ' Back again , are we ? Didn 't expect to see you so soon . Don 't take it personally , but it 's never good to have the police around . After Grant Leetham , are we ? Um , I just spoke to his mother - apparently he 's missing . There 's nothing new there . Here . How many people are in this building ? What , now ? Not many , school 's over . Em , four in Geology Club , Janey 's got this detention and I 've got a young lad in the gym ... What was that ? ! Your lives as you knew them are over . What the next 48 hours are about is abandoning everything you knew or thought you could rely on , and adjusting to the new reality . So are the things in Utopia real ? BSE was theirs . What 's that ? Comic . Are you going to show me or are you going to be a twat ? Keep it under your bed . 'That 's 11 now dead on the Shetland Island of Fetlar . ' We need a sample of the vaccine . There 's a man in Sheffield , a scientist called Donaldson , get it to him . It 's me . The manuscript exists . The boy knows where it is . There 's a woman , works in secret , trusts no-one . What 's her name ? Her name 's ... Milner . Right , shall we wait for Jessica ? What for ? I can break in . Yeah , I can break in as well . Jesus Christ ! Am I the only one who can 't break into houses ? ! We 'll teach you if you want . Ooh , got some bruising here . You 'll have to keep your weight off it . Thanks , Becky , for finding me . You got a boyfriend ? No ! I haven 't got a boyfriend . You 're well fit . I knew you would be . I can tell from what you typed . From what you typed , I thought you were 24 and drove a Porsche . I will drive a Porsche when I 'm 24 . I 've got a girlfriend , though . Her name 's Alice . I met her yesterday . Have you got the manuscript ? Grant , listen to me , it 's very important . I need ... We need ... Ow ! I 'm sorry . I left it somewhere . Right . When you 're ready , you need to come and tell me , OK ? What 's it like ? It 's ... not what I thought . I mean , I thought part two , it 'd be like a new story . But it ain 't . It 's the same , just ... just different . Like the scientist is called Carvel . And the ... And the rabbit , has he got a name , Grant ? I think it began with an L. So he has had it , then ? I mean , he can tell us where it is ? He 's an 11-year-old boy who 's seen someone murdered . Right ? He 's been alone for days , he 's not ready to trust anyone . So do we give it to Jessica then ? No way ! God knows what she 's up to . We take it to this woman , to Milner . I mean she 's MI5 . We take it to her , we hand it over , we just get the fuck out of this . Fuck ! Does he have it ? No . The manuscript ? Look , he 's left it somewhere , he hasn 't said where . Did you search him ? We are not searching him ! You want to search this , darlin ? Oi , Grant , stop that ! You 're just going to have to go through me . And she thinks that 'll be difficult . Sit down , Becky . - What the fuck 's the matter with you ? - And why are you so enthralled to ... Is that Grant ? What ? 'This is the image of the boy believed is responsible ... ' Why has it got my picture ? ' .. for the deaths of eight children and two teachers at Bainstow Secondary school , in what police have described as scenes of unparalleled horror . 'The Prime Minister is expected to make a statement 'within the next 20 minutes . But we can confirm ... ' That 's not me . ' .. the fingerprints on the gun are those of Grant Leetham , 'a pupil at the school , and the boy identified ... ' That is not me ! 'The Leetham family ... ' 'This is the image of the boy police believe is responsible 'for the deaths of eight children and two teachers ... ' How is he ? He 's pretending he 's OK . He 's ... terrified of what his mum thinks . Christ . How could they do that ? They faked the CCTV and the fingerprints . It don 't need to stand up in court , they just want to get hold of him . No , I mean how can they actually do it , how can someone ... ? It 's a handful of kids . So what ? They 've just made Grant the most famous child in this country . The moment he 's picked up , they have him . And all it cost them was a handful of lives . Don 't you get it yet ? That is nothing to them . Death is part of it . Get used to it . Look , Becky , I ... Wait , no ! No . It 's not a good idea . Why ? Won 't your girlfriend allow it ? Is it against orders ? My Dad wrote Utopia . I never knew him . Not really . I grew up on the run . I learned not to trust people , because you know what ? People always let you down . And they want to sugar-coat it . Treat you like a kid . That 's fine for them . They 've been kids . Some of us don 't get to have childhoods . Becky and Ian are great . But they 're not like us . I want you to show me the manuscript . I won 't force you . It 's your choice . But I want you to come with me . I 'll keep you safe . You know I can . There 's no place for me here . Not now , or ever . We always said this was Bhopal and this was Lake Nyos . 10,000 lives . Don 't feel good being right . Where 's Grant ? You like some shit music . Is this shit ? So your dad was Mark Dane ? His real name was Philip Carvel . What , and you didn 't know him ? They got me out when I was about four . I was given to a man called Christos . He looked after me , but he was more like a guard than a dad . He did his best . He taught me how to steal . How to fight . How to survive , really . I was a total bitch to him , but he never got angry . He was amazing . What happened to him ? We were hiding in an old factory and suddenly they turned up . He hid me and ran out at them . They caught him , tortured him , killed him . What , and you saw that ? How old were you ? Ten . Are you hungry ? - What are you doing now ? - Trying to bypass their firewall . It 's MI5 , not ASDA ! We 're better off hacking into the HMG network and sending her an intranet mail . I work with computers , I know ... You 're an IT consultant , Ian . If I want to know how to make a printer work , I 'll let you know . What are you two doing ? Trying to get hold of Milner . We 're thinking of sending her some kind of internal mail . The only problem is , their firewall is triple encrypted . Why don 't you just call her ? What ? Just call MI5 ? With a phone ? Yeah ... Why not ? What if they 're tracing her calls ? You have 42 seconds before they can get a trace on you . Wilson , how do you know that ? I saw it on Spooks . Don 't be on there for more than 30 seconds . I 'll time you . 'Security Service . ' Hello . Could I ... Could I speak to Mrs Milner , please ? 'One moment . ' They 're putting me through . 'Hello , Milner . ' Erm ... We 'd like to talk to you . We 're ... We 're friends of Jessica Hyde . 'Who ? ' Jessica Hyde . 'Right . Sorry , does she work here ? ' You don 't know her ? 'I have no idea who you 're talking about . Can I ask , who is this ? ' Wrong number . She said she 'd never heard of her . 'That line was monitored , this isn 't . 'Wherever you are , get out of there right now . ' Uh ... OK ... 'There 's a chapel on Arbel Lane in Levingstone . It 's always empty . 'Meet me there . Avoid CCTV . Get out of there . Now . ' Michael ? Are you OK ? Actually , I feel a bit ill , Jane . Could you call in sick for me ? Have you got the shits ? I think so , yeah . Aw , hon ! Well , I 'd love to stay , but you know how I hate the weak . Drink plenty of water and I 'll call Bev . Thanks . And no wanking in there . IVF clinic on Friday , you dirty puppy ! Ugh ... Professor Donaldson . Mm ? Mm ? Yes ? You knew Bill Kaye . Sorry , who ? Bill Kaye . He was a reporter . Uh ... No , no . I don 't know any reporters , actually . But he sent me to you . Well , I think someone must 've had you on ' we test ' pet food . Uh ... Spot check inspection . It says ' Department of Health ' . You get away from me . Stay away from me or I swear to Christ ! I 'm Michael Dugdale . Bill Kaye sent me to you . He must 've told you about me . Please ! You 're Michael Dugdale ? Yes . Yes , that 's me . Why the fuck didn 't you say so in the first place ? I 've got third-stage heart disease . You should eat better , then . Have you got the vaccine ? No ... I-I tried . Listen , they 've got Fetlar shut down . Nobody 's getting in or out . No doctors , no specialists - nothing . It all their own people . You haven 't got it ? Isn 't there another way ? Not unless you have a corpse in your pocket . Look ... I need ... I need something on them . You really have no idea who you 're dealing with , do you ? No . That 's why I need your help . Do you want to talk about last night ? Did you like it ? Of course I liked it . Then what 's there to talk about ? You 're such a pain in the arse ! As if life isn 't difficult enough . Tell you what , why don 't we get married , Ian ? Jessica can be my maid of honour . All right , I 'll tell you what . I 'll say it . I like you . There . I said it . It 's out . So now you can punch me or give me a Chinese burn or just ... just kick me in my balls . I reckon you 'd like that . Where 's the other cunt ? WHERE IS THE OTHER FUCKING CUNT ? ! Put that down . I 'm ... gonna ... shoot ... Right ? Cos I don 't think you are . Go on , then , shoot me . Cos if you don 't put that down , I 'm gonna shoot you . Look , please ... " Please " ? " Please " ? I 'm gonna shoot you in the fucking head , mate . I 'm gonna count to three . One ... Don 't . Two ... Did the bullet come out the front ? Did the bullet come out the front of his head ? No ... No , it didn 't . What 's your name , dear ? Wilson . Nice to meet you , Wilson . I 'm Milner . Now , I need you to come round here , and fire both barrels of that shotgun into his head . What ? This is a standard issue firearm I 've just signed out from ATC . I need to cover my tracks . He 's already dead . You 're not killing . You 're saving my life . Oh ! Oh , oh . Eugh ! You OK , Wilson ? Why don 't you let me have that gun ? How do I know this isn 't a trap ? How do we ? Look , we 've told you everything we know . We want to ... come in . Come in ? Ian , there is no " in " . I 'm not MI5 here , I can 't protect you . What do we do ? We need to find out why they want the manuscript . I think I know . It has the identity of Mr Rabbit . Grant said , but he couldn 't remember the name . That 's it . He 's kept his identity secret for nearly 30 years . That 's why they 're so desperate for the manuscript . He mentioned a girl called Alice . Said that that was his girlfriend . OK . I can find out if she 's come forward . You need to go there . No . No way . We 're not cops , we 're not spies . This has nothing to do with us ! What did Jessica tell you about her father 's ideas , Ian ? On racial purification ? What ? He was a fucking Nazi ? Philip Carvel wrote a paper called The Survival Of The Genome in which he advocated a human cull . This is the same man who became involved with weaponizing disease . Right . OK . If you can 't help us , we need to go . Look , I can 't do this on my own . This has one number on it - mine . Why come this way around ? You can hold it if you like . What if they give this room out ? They won 't . It 's occupied . Can you teach me how to do that ? There 's lots I can teach you . What , to be like you ? Would you like that ? You need to change the way you look . Argh ! Fucking hell ! Argh ! Argh ! That fucking hurt ! We are close , aren 't we , Grant ? To Utopia ? I ... need to know we 're moving in the right direction . Initial reports had indicated that everyone who died had an underlying health problem . However , three apparently healthy men in their 20s are now known to ... Argh ! Jessica ! That 's my head . Nice ! You look cute . You 're kidding ? Look , you 're making me a fucking Goth ! No ! You 're not putting that on me ! No way ! You 're not putting that on me . No ! You 're not putting that on me . Grant , just ... Just come home . Just go to the police and we 'll sort it out . Or phone Mum and we 'll come and get you . Everything 'll be fine . OK , I 'm here . Please , just ... Please come home . OK ? It 'll be all right . I know ... I need to tell her I didn 't do it . You know we can 't , Grant . Not yet . Am I going to be normal after this ? Let 's drink some booze . There 's a girl in Richmond , Alice Ward . Oh , God . What was I like as a child ? My earliest memory is killing animals . Slaughterhouse . You were there . Watching . Arby , please . For as long as I can remember , I 've killed . But ... Yesterday , there was a boy holding these ... and I couldn 't . Arby , don 't . Not now . Not know . Who are my parents ? You don 't have parents . You were part of a consignment - from Bulgaria , I think . Carvel was brilliant , but he wasn 't kind . Some of the things he did were , by necessity , cruel . What about Jessica Hyde ? Is she like me ? Did he do things to her ? He was not a man of compassion . Lee was killed the other day . Next to you , he 's the person I knew most . Why doesn 't that hurt me ? Because you 're not the same as others . You 're special . I don 't feel special . I look mental . Like a fucking Goth . How many of those have you had ? Can I have another one ? What 's the manuscript like , Grant ? Amazing . I didn 't read it all . Bits . What about ... What about my dad ? You are going to tell me where it is , Grant , aren 't you ? Because I could make you . I could just make you tell me . I 'm going to be sick . I 'm sorry . Jessica ... I 'm sorry . I want my mum . I want my mum . Her name 's Alice Ward . Her mother brought her into Richmond police station yesterday , she 'll be back today . I 'm sending an officer to get her . You need to go to her house . That 's what Jessica will do . I need a reason . Why us ? What difference does it make if we know who Mr Rabbit is ? There 's a story about how he got his name . He was embedded with the criminal underworld in Guangdong . But he was playing everyone off against each other . The Russians , CIA , the gangs . So the Americans got fed up . And they let a particularly nasty crime boss know that he was their man . The boss found him . Dragged him off the street . Right through the middle of a busy office block . They tortured him and , as a lesson to others , the boss carved his own name into this man 's stomach . Rabbit . Have you ever seen the Chinese character for " rabbit " , Ian ? Lots of lines , lots of cuts . Somehow he managed to get free and , despite being unarmed , he killed everyone in that room . Then he went back through the office block and killed everyone who 'd seen him . By the time he was finished , 265 people on three continents had lost their lives , and not a single living person knew his identity . That 's who Mr Rabbit is . He is the beating heart of all this and , if we can find his identity , it ends and you go home . I need to get across to Fetlar . Sorry , sir . There 's a quarantine in place . I 'm with the Department of Health . I have a permit of access issued by the minister . Plus an inter-department waiver , as well as a warrant for inspection . We weren 't told about all this . I 've come all the way from London . I 'm not turning back . Here . You 'll have to call him . What , phone the minister ? Yeah . A couple in here need shifting . Let 's go . Alice , we want to help Grant . Now , the kids at school , they say they saw him with you . We just want to know why they 'd be saying that . Alice , please . Just tell him . It 's OK . It takes time . We 've got a new officer who 's come to ask you some questions . He 'll take you somewhere else to do that now . What is this ? Who ? But you 'll still have our child liaison officer , Laura , to help , OK ? Here we go . Your new officer , Alice . Are you Alice Ward ? Did he give you the manuscript ? We 're going for a drive . Can I have it , please ? Grant ? Can I have it , please ? Give me the manuscript . What do you mean ? What manuscript ? Alice , what is this ? It 's ... It 's not there . It 's gone . What is ? What 's she talking about ? Tell me where it is , or she 's next . I haven 't got it ! Please ! It was here . Please ! I haven 't got it , please ! Please don 't kill my mum ! She hasn 't got it ! I 've got it ! Don 't hurt my daughter , please . My name is Jessica Hyde . You know who I am and what I 'm capable of . Give me the manuscript ! Or I 'll kill the girl 's mother ! The girl 's next . Give it to me ! Please , Jessica , please ! OK ! I 'll throw the weapon out . I 'm giving the manuscript to the boy . She comes in here , they get out , you get the manuscript . If you shoot before she 's gone , he runs . OK ? Do it slow . You keep these secret . Don 't tell anyone you have these , OK ? Jessica , please . Drop it . Drop it ! Give it me . Your father was Philip Carvel . What was he like ? I don 't know . That 's why I wanted that . Where is Jessica Hyde ? Come on . Grant ! Get in the van ! Come on ! Get in . 'I would have laughed , really hard . ' 'We were doing our best not to . ' And there he is ! Hello ! We didn 't hear you come in . Look who 's popped round . The Minister 's been telling me ... Jen , for God 's sake , do not call me " the Minister " , please ! I hope you don 't mind , Michael , but Jen and I have been getting rather personal . Geoff and his wife did IVF , too , and they were at it for years . For five fucking years . Christ ! I think the worst part is that there are things you can 't share . I mean , Sam was being pumped so full of those hormones that you just think , " Christ ... " It really can test a marriage . But now we have two beautiful boys who we wouldn 't exchange for the world , so ... Jen , do you mind if I just have a quick word with Michael ? Oh , of course , of course . Just boring Ministerial stuff , so ... No , no . Yes , of course . Thank you . She 's great . Just great . It would be such a shame to see her raped . Hand it over ... or Jen will be raped . Brutally , Michael . Later this week . Is that all of it ? Do you think I kept a piece ? What kind of idiot uses his own ID ? You are so fucking ridiculous . They wanted just to snatch you . Pick you up on your way home . Torture you . Kill you . Jen , as well , but I said no . " He 's useful . He 's a friend in the department . " Let me deal with him , " I said . " Because I know I can get him onside . " Michael , if you work with me , there 's a really good chance that I could make your life wonderful . But if you work against me , just one more time , I will make your life over . Is that clear ? 'Oh . Are you off ? ' 'Take care . See you soon . ' 'Yes . It was lovely to meet you ... ' 'Bye . '

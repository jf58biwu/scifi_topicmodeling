 Previously on Caprica ... I 'm trapped in this robot body , but I don 't want my father to know I exist . It 's our job ... we create life , and then one day we ... I 'm learning so much hanging out with my uncle and his pals . - What are you doing here ? - I was helping . No , you always go to school first thing , all right ? You wait for them to take attendance , then you skip . You stick around here ' till 3 : 00 and then I take you home . I 've decided to accept responsibility for my company 's impact on society . Daniel Graystone . My company will make no more profit on the Holobands or V-World licensing . That 's 60 % of our net . Hold me to it , Caprica . I woke up in the virtual world without knowing how I got here . I need to find someone who can show me the way home . If this is a dream , I think it 's too long . I don 't think this is a dream . This is the door , all right ? Come on , you 'll be free . Tamara 's avatar was my last hope of getting her back . Remember , it 's going to seem real , but it 's all virtual . Tamara ! Tamara is really gone ? I 'm sorry , but we can 't save them . Morning . Anybody home ? Hey , what are you doing here ? It 's a school day . Joseph , get up . Joseph ! Joseph , I said get up . Come on , up ! Hey . Where you going ? Taking Willie to school . - I 'll take him . - It 's all right , he 's late . No , no , no , no , no . Just hang on a second . I 'll get changed . Dad , it 's okay . I kinda want Uncle Sam to take me . Go wait . You going to work today ? You going to work today ? Yeah , it 's been a rough couple of weeks . - It 's not as bad as it looks . - No ? 'Cause it looks pretty frakked up . Well , then , why don 't you mind your own business ? This isn 't business . This is family ! You 're a Tauron , Joseph . You remember that ? No . No , I 'm a Caprican . Isn 't that what you always tell me ? You call yourself whatever you want , but first , you be a father . And when you can manage that , maybe I 'll introduce you to your son . No , I ... wake up , brother . Come on . um ... excuse me . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Hey , what the frak ? - Hey ... - I 'm sorry . Watch it . I 'm looking for someone named Vesta . I know she 's here . How the frak did you get to the front ? Is there a problem here ? Pushing her way through like that . I need to talk to Vesta . Look , I am stuck here and I can 't get out . I heard she can help me get home . Please just let me talk to her . If she can 't help me , I will leave . Okay , we 'll let you talk to her . But we get to watch . Here we go . Here we go . 1,000 . Put your bets down . Let 's go . Okay . 1,000 . Is this all you 're gonna bet ? Okay . Okay , let 's play . Let 's play . Yeah ? We got a taker . Bad dress . - Claims she 's stuck . - Okay . 1,500 to you . Grip ... pull ... Fire . What just happened ? Where did he go ? He de-rezzed . He 's gone . - Gone where ? - Wherever . Home . I want to play . You 're the girl who can 't get out . People have been talking about you . Look , I need to get outside . I need to go home . Can you please help me ? - Take off your band , baby . - I can 't ! She 's not de-rezzing . What 's up with her ? Vesta . Vesta , she didn 't de-rezz . No way ! It 's freaking me out , man ! Hmm , what do we have here ? She got shot , but she 's not de-rezzing . Shh ... Shh , it 's gonna be all right . You and I are gonna help each other . Shh . The pain should zap you out of the program , and you have to re-launch your avatar , but you ... - Can 't . - Don 't have to . She 's a sleeper . It 's supposed to be a myth . Someone who fell asleep with their Holoband on and can 't wake up . Somebody would have woken me up by now . Well , maybe you 're unconscious , in a coma . And there must be something wrong with your band because it should have timed out . But we can hack it . Do a manual disconnect . There 's some kind of price , isn 't there ? What do you want me to do ? Play a little game . That 's all . A game ? Yeah . Help me settle an old score . You play the game , I get you home . She 's not bleeding . I 've never seen anyone heal before . Not in V-World . Clean her up . Get her some new clothes . You 're going now . Yes , hi , this is Joseph Adama . This is Principal Andrews calling to check on Willie . What ? Well , he 's been out sick . No , no , no . He 's been at school . Well , he 's missed several days in a row now . You 've got ... how long ? Since the middle of last week . Oh , my gods . I get that . That 's simple , it 's so ... put the tray down , take the apron off , and come with me . Why don 't we go out back , Joseph ? It 's quieter there . We could talk . Oh , we 've got nothing to talk about ! You frakking bee-known blahx ! That 's nice . A little Tauron comes in useful once in a while doesn 't it ? Let 's go . Here 's a little Tauron saying for you , brother . I did not lose my son . Oh , really ? Then what are you doing here ? Where are you taking me ? This tunnel leads us to a different section of V-World . It 's a first player game . Once we 're there , we 'll take out a big player . Clean out his in-game bank account like a ... like a heist . None of us can come close to pulling this off , cause this guy 's got security . That 's not going to be a problem for you , okay ? What are you talking about ? You 'll see . Now get ready , here we go . I 'm outside . Wait , is this Caprica ? It 's a virtual Caprica . A digital recreation , but it 's lawless . Anything goes . Get down ! What is this place ? Welcome to new cap city . So this whole city is like a game ? Yeah . It 's kind of like a different version of Caprica City . They update it so it matches . Even the place where the Maglev train blew up is here . A Maglev train blew up ? How long have you been sleeping ? I don 't know . Okay , what 's the object of the game ? It 's a mystery . It 's almost like figuring out the object of the game is the object of the game . But we think it 's about getting things that convert into points , like money , or weapons ... so no one 's ever finished it ? Or won it ? Not yet . There 's this ... thing . When you die in the game , you 're out , and you can 't ever come back . But with you , I might actually have a shot . Okay , so our target is Chiron . He 's a fat cat . Likes to hang in this club on the lower east side . Back booth . Don 't look , just glance . It 's Chiron . The horse . Best gamer in the city . You 're going to pull security away , and I 'll grab his avatar , okay ? If he 's the competition , why don 't you just kill him ? His avatar is more useful to us . It gets us into his vault , then we have his money . His virtual money . Well , that 's how you win the game . You think . That 's right . Deal is , you help us win the game , and Vesta gets you home . Look , it 's not real , okay ? It is to me . You 're gonna pull security away , and I 'm gonna grab his avatar . Chiron . You forgot to call me . I can forgive you , if you play it right . I 'm sorry , dear . I have no idea who you are . Now get the hell out of here . No , you have to remember . I mean , come on . It was so sweet . You said that I could have anything that I wanted . Don 't you remember what I said ? I said that ... I said ... aah ! She didn 't get sent back . What 's going on ? She should have de-rezzed already . What ? Come on , come on . It 's okay , all right ? We 're gonna be okay . You did good . You did great . You did great . That just blows my mind . Well , was it worth it ? Did you get what you needed ? Yeah , we totally did . Look , just watch me now , don 't ... don 't be scared . You see ? It 's still just me . Anything that 's pure code can be manipulated . Now we can get into his bank vault , lift his virtual cash , and convert it into points in the game . So we pull that off , and Vesta helps you . Look ... I know this must seem really random to you . But this game , it really does mean something to me . It actually allows me to be ... something . Maybe if you weren 't in here playing this game you could be something out there too . You look goofy . You 're gonna embarrass me . I know that there 's a great spot , just ... this is so boring . Let 's just go home , please ! You 're gonna be so happy when we 're eating it . It 's delicious fish . Come on . You know , we haven 't been here in a long time . Since , uh ... since we came here with your mom and Tammy last summer . That was a great day . They were practically jumping on the line . Do you remember that ? Not really . Listen , Willie . If you ever want to talk about anything , about Mommy , or Tammy . Hey , what are you looking at ? I 'm here for you . You know that , right ? Yeah ... um , could we just go home , please ? - There 's no water . - What are you talking about ? This is ... the less water , the closer the fish are to the surface . Everybody knows that . Come on , get your rod . Aw , look at the little Tauron dirt-eater . You 've been unreachable for a day . I 'll call you back . And your assistant won 't look me in the eye . I think it 's time you told me what 's going on . The board called an emergency meeting . I 've been trying to figure out who 's behind it . Hmm ... is it Atkinson ? Well , it 's everyone . But , yeah , Atkinson , and Parker 's gonna be the one doing the talking . And the others will sit on their hands , let him go on about the stock price tanking , your decision to give up the V-World license . So if I don 't come up with answers to the holo-bank crisis they 're going to try to force me to step down from my own company . Do they , uh ... Do you think they have the votes ? Can we just go , please ? I want to go . Just wait a little longer . Don 't you love the fresh air and the beauty out here ? It 's much better than that smoke-filled room at Goldie 's . It 's so boring . Can we please go ? I don 't like it here , can we please go ? Looks like it 's gonna be dirt again tonight ! Just , listen ... ignore that . They 're idiots . You talking to me ? Who else would I be talking to ? Hey , Willie , just ignore them . Willie , put that down . I said , it must be fun to have all that dirt . Really ? Willie , get back here right now ! Willie ! Hey ! No ! - Get him , get him ! - Willie ! Hey ! Hey ! Beat him up ! Hey , come here . Stop it , Willie ! No ! Come here ! Did I wake you up ? No , I wasn 't sleeping . Not really . Maybe a few minutes . What 's going on ? I ... I think that , uh , I might be losing my company tomorrow . Do you remember when I was pregnant with Zoe ? We were living in that flat in Cloverdale . And you were taking the bus all over town because that car , that you loved , never worked . It worked . We hadn 't paid the rent for like , three months . You couldn 't afford even upper-level Bucs tickets . Ooh , things were really bad . But you had a big , fat meeting with Microcap . And you knew nobody wanted to see you in there , but you didn 't care . Someone had done you a favor . so you worked on that thing for months . And on the day of the meeting , you fell in the pouring rain getting off the bus . You slipped helping some woman ... Now I remember . With a stroller . And you landed on your ass on the sidewalk . So you walked into that meeting , in a soaking wet suit , and what turned out to be a broken wrist . And you walked out of there with the deal that would start everything . You can 't change the fact that he went on that show and killed the Holoband business . Well , he didn 't stick to the script . But on the flip side , our approval ratings skyrocketed . Exactly . And you think dumping the founder of this company now , in the middle of all this ... you think that 's going to help ? Daniel Graystone is the brand . He 's the public face of this corporation , and ... What is that ? Hello , everyone . I 'm so sorry I 'm late . Uh , Daniel . I 'd just like to say , we all understand you 're going through an awful lot right now . Holobands are over . Excuse me ? Holobands are over ? The hacked sites are eating up more and more of our market share each quarter . And that 's where the kids are going . Because they 're free . And the next generation coming up , they 'll expect it all to be free . We can 't own it forever . We can either marshal all our resources and funds towards saving that sinking ship . Or we can look for the next big thing , the next big leap forward that will change the worlds . We either move into the future , or we die trying to hold on to our past . And this ... This is our future . Fancy machines that cost millions of cubits ? The cost is irrelevant , considering all that it can do . U-87 ? Make the circuit , please . Take a nice look at all these fine folks . Looks a little uncomfortable , doesn 't it ? Do you find yourself wondering what it might be thinking ? Or feeling ? Well , that is the big leap forward , people . Do you sense it ? Beyond artificial intelligence , this is artificial sentience . Do you feel it ? I feel it . Don 't you ? I feel like there is a being inside this machine , something alive and vital ... And special . And it 's not our imagination . Look at the test results . There is a brilliant mind in here . So in terms of practical applications ... Are you seriously asking me about the practical applications of creating another race that will walk beside us ? Do you not understand the enormity of this creation ? It 's more than a machine . This Cylon will become a tireless worker ... Who won 't need to be paid . It won 't retire or get sick . He won 't have rights , or objections , or complaints . It will do anything and everything we ask of it without question . U-87 ... rip your arm off . Go on . Go on ! Looked a little painful , didn 't it ? The desire to anthropomorphize , the need to connect ... it 's powerful . And that is why this thing is going to sell . We make them . We own them . They 're real . And the world 's just changed . So ... I believe you were going to take a vote ? Wait . Take a powder . I said blow . This place is a bank ? Where did the security go ? And where 's the vault ? The guards were pure code , not players . They are the security . They scanned the Chiron avatar , and it passed . As for the vault , we 're standing on it . Vesta decoded this sequence from a puzzle across town . It was encoded on manhole covers . Really tough to get , but we got it . So I 'll just name off the signs and you step on them as we go , okay ? Okay , just hurry up . All right , you ready ? Yeah . Picon . Caprica . Gemenon . Picon . Tauron . See how this registers as points ? It 's gotta mean something . This has to be the point of the game . Oh , frak . How 'd you do that ? I don 't know . Gods , what are you ? Willie , do your homework . Willie , stop that . Stop it ! What have you been teaching him , Sam ? Same things we 've been taught . He 's gonna be a man soon , Joseph . You know on Tauron , at his age , he already would be . He 's gonna make choices . - I don 't know what to do , Sam . - You know what to do , Joseph . It 's what you 've been thinking about . It 's what you 've been avoiding . Too Tauron for you , maybe . But not for your son . You 're ling him . You are losing him , Joseph . Your son needs closure . It 's time to let Shannon and Tamara go . Look past yourself and perform the rites , brother . You got the votes . You better be right . Welcome to our home . Sati . What 's taking so long ? What are you doing ? I know what this is for . I know what it 's for . Go , go , go , go . You ready ? I 'm ready . You sure moved in fast . Did you get it ? She 's amazing . Stopped the guards , messed with the codes . Like hacking without even hacking . Really ? Interesting . Bring it to me . No . You 're gonna wake me up , get me home , and then you get your money . Yeah ... well , see , I 've been looking into that , and I can 't . It 's only a month old . It 's yellowing , but you still can make out the names on the list . What a shame . Tamara Adams , 16 years old . 615 Olympic Street , # 3 , Caprica City . Isn 't that you , baby ? So young . Wait , wait , I don 't get it . What ... what 's the list ? What 's the list of ? It doesn 't matter . You 're dead , baby . Does that explain why she can do what she did to the guards ? I think it might . You 're not going home , doll face . Don 't worry . We 've got plenty for you to do , baby . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . You need to go to the real world . You need to find my father . You know the address . You heard it . 615 Olympic , # 3 . I 'll wait for you in New Cap City so you can find me . I can 't go back to the real world , okay ... you could be something there ! Just take off your Holoband , okay ? You 're not gonna die here . Just go . What are you ? I 'm awake . Do you have a coin for me , Joseph ? I have a coin for my wife , Shannon Adama . I have a coin for my sister , Tamara Adama . Will you grant them passage ? They will have passage . Will you let them go ? Yes . Yes . Will you bid them farewell ? Goodbye , Shannon . Goodbye , Tamara . Goodbye , Tamara . Goodbye , Mom . Then they will live forever in peace . They will live forever in your hearts . That 's a good one . Hi , can I help you ? Hey , are you , uh , Joseph Adams ? It 's Adama . How can I help you ? Tamara sent me . What are you talking about ? She gave me this address , right ... Okay , look , she 's in the V-World and she can 't get out . If you can just help me ... you saw her ? Yeah , but I think she was just sleeping or something . So if you could just please go wake her up , she really needs that . My daughter 's dead . She died in the Maglev attacks . Oh , gods , I ... I 'm sorry . You saw her in V-World ? You gotta take me there . You gotta take me to see her . Okay ? Hey ... Hey ! Stop ! Stop ! Hey . Tammy .

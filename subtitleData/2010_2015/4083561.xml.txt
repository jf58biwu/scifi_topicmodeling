 Eight months ago , the sisterhood of fertility made a secret pact and now the time has come to reveal the fruits of our labor . It 's baby bump time ! I can 't believe we 're all going to be mommies at the same time ! I just felt it kick ! Come on , Sharon , show us yours . No , I 'm really bloated . Share with the sisterhood , Sharon . It 's so cold and boney . What 's wrong with your baby ? Is that a chicken ? It 's actually a Turkey . You 've brought shame to the sisterhood . But , I tried so hard . I did it with everybody except for that stoner and his one-armed friend . What 's the point of being the school slut if you can 't get knocked up ? Looks like you 're barren , Sharon . Barren Sharon ! Barren Sharon ! Hey , you told me that sperm sample was for a science project . Shsharon ) Vulga ... Gravi ... Infintt malm ! M ! good morning , everyone . Welcome to family planning . Everybody will be paired up to become parents of their own virtual baby . Hey , Jenny- - help me out ? Be my baby mama ? Are you kidding ? You 'd make a terrible father , Todd . What makes you say that ? You just gave your baby a joint . Sadly this may be the closest some of you ever get to having a baby , as the hand of fate is a cruel master . Sharon has the book . Come on , she 's probably just sick . Ugh ... Okay , that was definitely book puke . Â  ª hey , stop her ! She 's got the book ! Whack ! Who 's an awesome guidance counsellor ? Holy shit ! Monster fat is on the loose again ! No , you idiot , she 's pregnant . Oh ... I told you she used the book but you all doubted me . To be fair you also thought somebody used the book to make you fail algebra . Sharon , we all know you used the book so don 't deny it . I don 't deny it . I totally used it and I would use it again . Jenny , it was amazing ! I wanted a baby and it came true . Getting knocked up is what you wanted more than anything in the world ? Yeah , it 's like the ' in ' thing to do . Really ? I thought gordian knot theory was the ' in ' thing . Okay- - where 's the book , Sharon ? Okay , can you give us another clue ? She 's going into labor ! Dude , shit ! Holy shit who 's gonna deliver it ? I have a placenta allergy . What like I 'm the second best choice ? You want to be in charge , so be in charge ! If I 'm in charge then I order you to do it ! Someone get it out of me ! Okay everyone , hold her down ! Todd , you spread her legs and hike up her skirt ! And not in a sexual way . Ughhhhh ! That is the hugest vagina I 've ever seen ! More like the only vagina . She 's got you there , dude . Ugh , I see blood and hair , and bloody hair and looks like the top of a mango ! A bloody mango ! That 's the head ! Push it back in ! No no ! Pull it out ! Wait ! Okay go ! Dude , that was awesome ! Splat ! Oh , we gotta do that again ! I wasn 't filming . Do you have another one of those inside of you ? That does big gross things . Man , I can 't believe Jenny doesn 't think I 'd make a good father . This totally messes with my ten year plan . You have a ten year plan ? I don 't even know what I 'm doing tonight . We 're going to visit Sharon at the hospital remember ? So we can find the book . Oh yeah . So what 's your ten year plan ? Oh man , it 's so awesome . Â  ª home sweet home ! I missed you , my sexy wench . How was your 3 year world tour , my darling ? We 're # 1 in Mongolia . You always were popular with mongaloids . Hello , my new born son . Your dad brought you a gift . Like father like son . I think I see a flaw with your plan , dude . If you 'd been on tour for 3 years , then that isn 't your baby . Well , what are you saying ? I 'm saying that Jenny is a two timing slut . Who 's a two timing slut ? Future Jenny . Hey , Jenny don 't do anything to freak out Sharon or the baby , okay ? What ? I 'm great with babies . I 'd make an awesome dad . Just because you delivered a baby doesn 't make you a father . In fact , it makes you a midwife . Cheer up , Todd . Think of all the money we can make as midwives . There 's something wrong with that baby ! Shut up shut up shut up ! You stupid baby ! Oh , I don 't like her . Hey , Sharon ! Can you hear me ? Hello ? Shut up shut up shut up ! Sharon ? What did you do with the book ? It 's nothing like I thought it would be . I wanted a cute baby , instead I got that . I don 't give a rat 's ass about your miracle of motherhood . Where 's the book ? I 'm completely spent . Every last drop . See ? The book 's gotta be around here somewhere . Will somebody shut that baby up ? Ok , ok , ok . It 's ok , little dude . You don 't need to cry . Uh ok , ok- - so how do you like being born and stuff ? Dada ? No , no I 'm not- - no , I 'm not your dad . I 'm just a dude who pulled you out of your mom . Dada . No . My name is Todd . Say it , Todd . Tata . No , um- - how do I explain this to a little dude ? Your dad is a book . And he 's an evil book , too . But that doesn 't mean that you 're evil . Maybe it does . Dada , dada ! Holy shit ! This book is a blanky ! No no no no ! It 's ok , little dude . You don 't need to cry . I 'm just trying to separate you from your dad . It 's wet ! Be gone foul demon ! In the name of the lord , i command thee ! Not him , you idiot , the baby ! Get the devil out of the baby ! Thou shalt not harm this- - I just need the blanket ! Beautiful ... Child of ... Jesus Christ ! You 'd make a great father , Todd . It wasn 't my fault ! How can that baby already be walking ? They grow up so fast . Dada ? Hello ? Is that a baby ? There , there- - I 'm coming ! Oh , my gosh ... What a big baby ... Dada ? Ahhhhhhhh ! If we were lost , scared and rapidly growing where would we go ? Think like a baby . Babies can 't think for themselves . Just like those morons who thought it was a great idea to get pregnant . I can 't see myself ever getting pregnant . I hate babies , too ! Well , that 's not what I mean- - why would you want to bring a kid into this fucked up world ? I agree . The earth is overpopulated as it is . Scientists predict that by 2035 we 'll- - and it totally ruins your body . Cracked nipples . That sounds painful . If I wanted someone leeching off of me , I 'd get a boyfriend . Babies are kind of like parasites , aren 't they ? Breathing your breath , eating your food , waiting to burst out of you at any moment . Although , I would adopt . No , babies are trouble just like the guys that give them to you . They 're loud . They 're messy , and they just wanna snack on your boobs . Guys give you babies so that they can control you . You 're very angry . Thank you but I 'm just a straight shooter . Maybe if the right man came along ... No . Trust me , Hannah- - guys don 't care about babies . They just care about making them . Man , all these chicks getting pregnant , not one of them asked me to knock them up . Hey cheer up , Todd . It 's not your fault your baby went awol . These things happen . My parents have been trying to get rid of me for years . It 's not my baby , Curtis . You said it was calling you dada . It 's a baby , it calls everything dada or mama . Also that baby is evil it was spawned by the book . Evil or not , we gotta name it something tough . Now we could call it punch , slap , elb ow - - naming it elbow doesn 't make it tough . Jax ? No . You know what Todd ? Why don 't you think of a name then ? Okay , um ... How about ... Brunt ? We better hope it 's not a fat kid . I like brunt . Well , I like jax . We could combine the jax and brunt . Yeah ! Jrunt ! I was thinking more like brax . Brax ... He sounds like a soldier from the future . Wicked . Oh ... Wow , what 's going on ? They 're peeling miss lilly off the floor , or what 's left of her . Somebody spotted a huge baby entering the school last night . You think it might be brax ? You mean the third star in the coring minor constellation ? No . We named the baby brax . Typical . You guys have all the fun like naming babies , while Hannah and I do all the serious work . What serious work ? Shut up . Judging by what just happened to miss lilly , I 'd say we 're not dealing with a helpless baby . It may not even be a baby anymore . Who knows how big it 's grown by now . Dude , I just had a horrible thought . You might have to quit school and get a job . You know , to support little bracks . What the hell are you talking about , Curtis ? The baby thinks Todd is his daddy . He even stops crying when Todd 's around . And you thought Todd would make a terrible father . In your face , Jenny ! You never mentioned any of this . 'Cause it 's irrelevant , it 's not my baby . Have you seen my baby ? My baby ! It 's her baby . Have you seen my baby ? Have you seen my baby ? Oh so now you wanna be mom ? Make up your mind , will you ? I want my baby ! Will you help me find him ? What ? No , no , I 'm terrible with kids . You said so yourself , Jenny . We find the baby , we find the book . I hate it when you 're right . Okay , Sharon I 'll help you find your baby , brax . Who ? We named your baby brax . No , his name 's agamemnon . What , it 's a classical Greek name . You 'll make a great mother . Okay , can we go now ? Thank you . Hello ? Atticus why have you not yet found the book ? My patience is running out ! It 's um- - uh , I- - I do have a job , your evilness . My apologies but , it 's hard work being a guidance counsellor . I 'll call you back . Atticus ! Â  ª dada ! Sweet mother of Satan ... The book is a blankie ? Hello ... Mr baby . Atticus , who is who I am , is here to help you . Sorry , mr baby . Smooth move , atticus . Noooooooo ! I won 't lose you again , brax ! Hold on ! I 'm coming ! Have you seen my baby ? Are you sure ? Oh- - hi , kids . Are you okay , mr Murphy ? I 'm wonderful . Could you do me a favor ? Save me from this big bad baby ! Uh- - hey there , brax ... It 's okay . I 'm here for you . Dada ? Yeah , that 's right- - your uh , your dada is here ... No ! No ! Dammit , come back here ! The book blanky thing ! Dada ! You sure have gotten gigantic , haven 't you ? No , Todd ! Ah-ah-ah ! Ughhh ! Easy , easy , easy- - that wasn 't so hard . You gotta learn to chill out . When you 're old enough , I 'm gonna introduce you to a beautiful thing called marijuana . Wow , I wish I had a dad like Todd . It 's like he 's some sort of baby whisperer . See , there you go . More like a book of pure evil whisperer . Baby ! Mommy 's really sorry she yelled at you ! You hear that ? That 's your mommy calling . She may not be the best mom in the entire world , but you should give her a chance , okay ? Okay , go to her . For me . Â  ª ♪ ♪ baby ! Ahhhhhhhh ! Whoa ! It 's okay , brax ! Everything 's okay ! Sure he just squashed his mother to death , that 's all . And miss lilly . It 's better if we just say he killed them with kindness . Give me a break ! That big bad baby is a menace to society ! He 's not bad , Jenny . He 's just misunderstood . Like me . I 'm gonna miss brax . Maybe we shouldn 't have given him such an evil name . Yeah ... Oh that 's an interesting debate . Were we born or were we created ? Uh , I 'm pretty sure we 're born , Hannah . I watched it happen like yesterday . I mean , is it nature ? Shhh ... Let them have this one . Those paramedics sure got here fast . I always see them parked up the street . Makes sense . Do you think it 's ' cause of all the kids who like , die here ? Probably . Do we have to wait forever ? When he 's ready , he 'll come to us . What a loser . Pure evil loser . The book changes shape but only sometimes . Why is that ? Maybe it 's getting bored doing the same thing all the time . Does anyone have any real theories ? Oh hey , Jenny- - so if you ever decide that you wanna have a kid ... You know where to go , right ? Yeah . To a sperm bank . What ? Come on . Admit it , I 'm great with kids . Maybe- - or maybe you just have a weird connection to the book . So what are you getting at ? I dunno Todd , it 's like the book treats you differently . The big bad baby called you dad . Bailey 's monster cock spoke to you . The homunculous looked like you- - it 's a lot of little things , but I think they might add up to something ... Good news , kids , the baby 's been destroyed . What ? Just kidding- - he 's been adopted . By who ? The parents prefer to remain anonymous . All you need to know is he 's in a loving environment .

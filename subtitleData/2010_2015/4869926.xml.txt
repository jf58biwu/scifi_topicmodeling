 Previously on Touch ... My son , Jake , he led me to you to try and help you find your daughter . Amelia ! No ! So all this time , and it was some company ? Aster Corps . They brought your daughter to the facility after they staged her death . They 're after my son for the same reasons . And begin . Jackpot 3 . Jackpot 1 . Jackpot 3 . Amelia beat the supercomputer ? No , Mrs. N. Amelia 's teaching a supercomputer . Right now , the only evidence that 's going to matter is finding your daughter alive . And if we move too fast , if we push these people , we scare them , they will kill her . So we cannot go to the police . So what do we do now ? I know a guy here . We were correspondents together . So I 'm gonna take a wild guess that this is not the LA Times ? It 's called BreakWire ; it 's a web-based , user-generated news organization . Martin , I met a man today named Guillermo Ortiz . He had photos in his room of people who have been murdered . Each one special , like Jake . This man , I believe , is coming for Jake . An Arctic storm moving southward can suddenly crash into a tropical hurricane that 's driving north , and when these collisions of weather systems occur , it causes the storm to explode . The sum total of the destructive energy is far greater than what any of them would have been had they remained on their own , creating what meteorologists sometimes call perfect conditions for a deadly storm . A perfect storm . You 're using different colors . Hey . Hey . Not exactly traveling weather , is it ? Mm . A friend of mine and Trevor 's is coming to BreakWire tonight . His name is Dutch ; he was an ex-special forces guy . Ran security for some of the journalists in Bosnia . That 's nice . I was thinking about maybe talking to him , see if he could help us find Amelia . I appreciate it . I do . But I got to go , you know ? I know . It 's just ... It 's been days and still nothing , right ? Let me help you . I got it . Lucy . I can 't go to the cops and tell them that the murder they 're investigating has to do with my daughter 's abduction , and why , because I don 't want to jeopardize Jake . You know I would never do that . Lucy , stop . She 's your daughter . You have to do what you think is right ; I understand that . I just want you to know that Jake and I will never stop looking for her . And if , for whatever reason , you want to come back , we 'll be here . Okay ? Thanks . Yeah . So what do I tell the boy ? He loves you . You 'll be fine . It 's your moment , Jake . Stay strong . The numbers will protect you . Are you ready ? Hey , buddy . I got to go now . To find Amelia . Okay . You are a very cool boy . All loaded up . Hey . Here . Thank you for everything . I appreciate it . You sure about this ? Of course not . Oh , thank you , mister . I wouldn 't have gotten very far without that , would I ? Thanks again . Hey . Thanks . I 'll take that . Okay . Bye . Bye , Lucy . In humans , a fear response happens in less that 40 milliseconds . Immediately , a massive shot of adrenaline makes our muscles tense up to fight , our heart rate increases so we can elude predators , we sweat so we don 't overheat , pupils dilate so we can see in the dark . Seriously , is this the best you got ? Well , I 'm not gonna waste my best booze on you , now am I ? Come here . Hey , everyone , this is Dutch . Dutch , this is everyone . Hey , everyone . - Hi Dutch . - You look good . Yeah , I do , don 't I ? Yeah , you do . But you , uh , not so much . You haven 't changed . Good seeing you , man . I thought you said Martin was supposed to be here . Oh , yeah , he 's probably stuck in this weather ; I 'll give him a call , see how far away he is . Despite the fact that each of us reacts to fear in the same way , neuroscience still has found no way to quantify fear itself . But sometimes , what brings us together are those things we 're all afraid of . Martin , where are you ? Dutch just got here . Hey , Trevor . It 's Lucy . Sorry , um , somehow I ended up with Martin 's phone , and he probably has mine . And I have an idea how . Um , he 's on his way over there . I am , too , apparently . Oh , he just got here . Come and join the party . Dutch . Hey . Ain 't you a sight for sore eyes . It 's great to see you . - How are you ? - Look at ya . That 's a cool design you 're making there , buddy . Look , I 'm gonna go sit with Trevor and Dutch . If you need anything , I 'll be right over there , okay ? Okay . I was just telling Trevor here how of all the pantywaisted journalists in-country , you were the only one who told it like it was . What was I , chopped liver ? You were British . You already had two strikes against you . Oh , spoken like a true Yank . To Martin , the man who saved my life . That was a long time ago . Of course ; how could I forget ? It was Martin who saved your life . Oh , come on . You never would have found me if it wasn 't for Martin working the back channels , connecting the dots . You know that 's true . But it was me who fired the kill shot and why ? Because Martin froze . No , no . The way I remember it , the guy who was holding Trevor had a grenade and it would have been irresponsible for me to take the shot in that situation . No situation is ever like you think it is . It 's always a crapshoot . That first kill is always the hardest . After that , it gets easy . I 'm gonna get some ice . You guys good ? Uh ... Trevor and I 'll never forget what you did for us that day , Dutch . Ah , look , it ... it 's okay , Martin . It 's the booze , I 'm sorry . I just miss the fight , that 's all . Yeah . About that . I need to ask a favor . Anything , what is it ? Well , it 's a long story , but there are some people that are after my son . Jake can 't speak , or he-he won 't speak , but he 's got a gift- - he can see things in numbers and patterns almost like he can see the future . And these people that are trying to take him away from me . I 'll be right back . Hey , buddy , it 's all right , okay ? It 's just a storm . Jake , it 's all right . All right , we 're checking the breakers but given the storm out there , well , this blackout could last a while . Now , you 're all free to call it a day , of course , but I think we 're probably best just sticking out here until the rain abates a bit . So I 'm the one responsible for defending every file at BreakWire in exactly this kind of emergency . Cool . Checked the circuit breaker blocks- - it 's dead . Hey , buddy . See how the emergency lights came on right away ? Looks kind of cool in here , huh ? Hey . Someone forget to pay the electricity bill or what ? Lucy . What are you doing here ? Oh , let me show you . Ta-dink . I am so sorry . Looks like Jake wasn 't finished with you yet . Mm . So much for leaving Los Angeles tonight . Why don 't you just stay and hang out with us until this blows over ? Um ... I don 't know- - if I 'm gonna get stuck here I might as well check in someplace with clean sheets . Yeah . Hey , let 's not make a big deal out of this the second time , okay ? I 'll call you from the road . Okay . Okay . Bye . Bye . Hey . You 're not fooling me- - I know you 're upset about me leaving . I 'm upset , too . I just ... I have to go find Amelia , you know ... Hey . Lucy . He really wants you to stay- - I 've never seen him do that with anyone before . Hey , Luce . Well , I promised you a party . What do you think ? It 's a pretty wild party . Listen , I got through to Emergency Services on my cell . The roads are closed from here to the beach and north to Sunset , so unless you brought a canoe . No , no canoe . Looks like Dutch has the right idea . Mm-hmm , and it looks like I 'm staying . You want to go get a slice of pizza before it 's all gone ? See you in a second . Trevor , come here . Excuse me . Can I help you ? Oh , yeah , we 're checking the commercial buildings in the area to see who has lost power . Oh , well , yeah , you can put us on the top of the list on that one . How long do you think it 'll take you to get things running ? Depends on the storm , sir . I just need to check the connection of the subpanel to the main house source so there is no danger of a surge when the power comes back on . Hey , man . Do whatever you got to do . Uh , the panel is down the hall on the right . Okay , thank you . It shouldn 't be that long now . Mm ... Where you going , bud ? Jake ? Hello ? Have room for one more in there , buddy ? I 'm too big for this . So you understand why I can 't go to the police . I 'm wanted , they 'll take Jake away from me . Right now , finding the girl Amelia is the only way to prove that any of this is true . I also got a call from New York from a friend warning me about a man named Guillermo Ortiz , linked to multiple homicides around the world . All of his victims have Jake 's gift in one form or another . I don 't think he can track us down for a while , but ... truth is , Dutch , I need your help . I 'm out of my depth . Why don 't we meet up tomorrow ? Come up with a game plan . Don 't worry . We 'll find the girl . And get you and your son out of this , I promise . Thank you . Mm-hmm . Thank you . What are friends for ? Lifesaver ... Your shoulder 's still bothering you . You mean my Sarajevo souvenir ? Dutch , you don 't need to show me . Aw , come on . No , Dutch , don 't show me . Don 't ... Where 's Jake and Lucy ? Oh , they 're in the game room under the Ping-Pong table . That 's strange . Cell service was working a few minutes ago . Hey , Santiago , chill with the Casanova for five minutes , would you ? Storm must have knocked down a nearby cell tower and I 've got to get an update to Mike in Long Beach . Would you try to patch me into a different cell network ? Excuse me ? I 'm off duty , sir . Make Philip do it . How about I just make you file for unemployment ? Ruben , just a hint . You might get a little more privacy in the control room . You got it . Good . Hey , wait , wait . Wait , wait , they might hear . Mm-mm , I don 't think they can hear us . Yet . Wait . What 's wrong ? What is that ? It-it 's a cell phone jammer . What the hell is it doing in here ? Who cares ? I 'm so sorry . Shh . What the hell are you doing in here ? I 'm afraid we have a problem . What ? What problem ? You see , in a holy war , there is no such thing as collateral damage . What are you talking about ? But tonight is special . I 've spent the last 11 years of my life preparing for it . And now , there is simply those who are or are not in my way . Wait ... wait ... What ? What , buddy ? Hey . Jake ? Santiago , that little weasel 's not coming back- - he 's probably halfway to third base by now . Let me see . It 's just about priorities , you know , Martin ? Hey , Jake ! Jake . Hey , Jake ! Hold on . Where you going ? Jake . Buddy , let 's not go too far . When you and I were his age , would we have deliberately dodged an assignment from our supervisor so we could waste time chasing a bit of skirt ? Really ? Relax , Trevor . We 've both been there . I 'll go get him . It was my fault . Jake , wait up . Jake ! What are you doing ? What is this place ? Buddy ... You can 't run away like that . Are you trying to tell me something ? Honey ? Ruben , it 's Martin . You decent ? Jake . Jake ! I just found Reuben and the girl he was with dead in the control room . Dead ? Their throats were slit . I can 't find Jake . Julie ! Try to get through to the police ! Follow me . Oh , my God ! Trevor , where do both of these staircases lead ? This was an old , condemned newspaper building when I bought the place . I only know the couple of areas I 've renovated . Dutch , you check upstairs . I 'll go down . Trevor , go back to the bullpen in case Jake makes it back there . Oh , no . Jake . It 's me , buddy . If you 're hiding down here , you don 't need to be scared . You can come out . Okay , everyone just stay calm . We 're gonna get out of here , it 's gonna be okay . Right . I-It 's locked , it won 't open . Well , let me see , let me see , let me see . Let me try it . There 's a chain on it . Trevor ! Can we just like ... can we break the door or something ? It won 't open . It 's been chained shut . Get me something to break the glass . Quick . Come on , Jake . We gotta hurry . What is this place ? So dirty , huh ? What ? That 's nice . What is it , bud ? Trying to tell me something ? The mirror ? Um ... I don 't get it , bud . Let me see ... This is just like the blue butterflies Amelia used to draw . Honey , are you communicating with Amelia ? Is that it ? Is that why you wanted me to stay , so we could finish this and we could find her together ? I 'll follow you . Okay ? Jake . Who is that ? Please , help me . Oh , my God . It 's all right , I 'm gonna help you , okay ? What 's-what 's your name ? Philip . Phil , I need to take a look at your wound . Okay , keep your hand right there . Phil , the man that did this to you ... was he alone ? Yeah . Dressed like a city worker . Big scar on his neck . Jake . I think I should go get your dad . Buddy , will you walk downstairs with me so I can get your dad ? Lucy ! Dutch ? Yeah . We have a problem . What ? Two people 's throats have been slashed . Where ? Downstairs in the control room . I think I know who did it , and he 's after Jake . Jake ! Shh ! Hey , bud . What do we do ? There 's no other way out . Stay low . Stay back . Jake , we have to hide . The man who did this to you , he 's come here to kill my son . I can 't find my son . Y-Your son ... I saw him . Where ? Where did you see my son ? Come on , Philip , stay with me . He was with a woman . They were in the stairwell . Lucy . Okay . I need to get you up , okay ? Come on . Jake . Please , honey . Buddy , now ! There ! Come on , buddy . That 's right . There . Stay here . I know you 're in pain . Unbearable pain . Stop it ! Stop it . Stop it ! Jake , when I tell you to , run , okay ? Run , Jake , run ! Jake ! Run , Jake ! I gotta stand you up . Come on . Trevor ! Trevor ! Come on . You got it . Trevor ! Martin , what the hell ? I think I slowed down the bleeding . The others got out . Ted 's trying to call the police . Okay , good . Get him out , too . I gotta go after Jake . All right , come on . Up . Up . Jake ! Stop ! Stop ! Jake . You better stop now ! It 's okay . There 's another way . Come on . It 's not 17 . It 's 26 . You know it 's 26 . Oh , no . Jake ! Jake ! Lifesaver ! Dutch , oh , my God ! Look , I 'm all right . I 'm all right . I 've been trying to get on the roof , but the door 's been jammed . Don 't worry . We 'll get it open . Jake ? Jake ! She loved you . I know you 're in pain . Unbearable pain . Stop it . Stop it , boy . Whatever you thought you could accomplish tonight , you failed . But we both know what that date means to me . It 's all the more reason why you cannot exist here . But you also knew love before you turned to death You can 't hurt a man who lost everything . I 'm already dead . God took my family ; my wife , my son on the blackest day ; the day you were born . No , no , Jake ! Lucy , are you okay ? Jake , Jake , Jake , Jake . Jake ! Jake ! Sweetheart . Wake up . Jake ! Please wake up . Jake ! It 's all right . It 's all right , sweetheart . You 're safe . He 's gone . He can 't hurt you , okay ? It 's all right . What ? That 's impossible . No , no . Dutch , Dutch . Dutch . Fear- - base , raw , mortal fear- - is the dividing line in our species . And no matter how hard we struggle to define it , it can 't be quantified . But it 's one of the only constant units of measure , one of the few things that makes us who we are . The only uniquely human force with enough power to overcome fear is love . If you 're done working , it 's time for dinner , okay ? We 'll be there in a minute .

 - You 're late . - You must be captain Ramirez ? I 'm all that 's left . Toth , Tech Sergeant , Demolitions . I 've got a timetable . - I can 't just sit around and wait . - It 'll blow over by morning , Plus I 've got a secure location where we can hole up for tonight . That 's your secure location ? A frakking ski lodge ? Toasters used it as a storage facility after the initial attack . Then they just abandoned it . What were they storing ? Spare parts . Anyway , four stars and all the comforts . Some of the suites even have gas fireplaces , honey . Watch your step ! I got my babies planted all around here . Trip wires and mines . Follow me . Is it me or this guy wound a little tight ? Come on . Nice , huh ? I got a generator setup for minimal power . Just don 't turn on too many lights , for obvious reasons , and if someone or something comes in knocking ... Controlled bursts . We 're low on ammo . Anybody want some rack time ? Now 's your chance . I 'll take first watch . Are you all right ? Yeah . What was he like ? - My husband ? - Yeah . A lot like you , actually . Idealistic , ambitious . Was he a computer nerd , like you ? A professor , thank you very much . An historian who woke up one day and decided he couldn 't just sit back and watch history pass him by . He never wanted to be a hero , but they turned him into one anyway . Slapped his face on recruiting posters all but resurrected him in V-World . Yeah , I remember that . I 'm just gonna sleep by the fire . Yeah , I 'll make a bed over there . What you don 't remember , because they never let it out , is that afterward a reporter found out it was all a fabrication . A lie . He didn 't take out a Cylon platoon . His scouting party was shot up by men from his own unit . Friendly fire . But like you said , it 's a war , right ? Shit happens . I saw them . All for the war . Everything they tell you to make you give up what really matters . That 's why this war has to end . I understand . Believe me , I understand . You 're going to regret this . Back home , I couldn 't afford any of this stuff . Figured it 'd be a crime to let it go to waste . May I ? Help yourself . Show some respect and don 't frakking sip that . It 's nice . You had to frak her , didn 't you ? Dumb , Husker . Dumb , dumb , dumb . Wasn 't like that . It just ... happened . I guarantee you , whatever it was like , it did not " just happen . " Case in point : I 'm guessing she did not tell you why we 're here ? She did . Kinda . She lost her husband . He was come kind of ... Her husband ? Her frakking husband . Someone hit the tripwires . Let 's go get your girlfriend . Don 't need her getting in the way of any bullets . Beka ? What ? I thought she 'd wait here . She probably just got spooked . We 'll find her . I 'll take the north wing , you go south . Stay cool Husker , alright ? Keep your head down . Hey , bastards , come to daddy . She 's okay , but this one almost nailed her before I got here . What 's that noise it 's making ? Screaming . - Sorry , what ? Screaming ? - They feel pain . Got to put this thing out of its misery there . It 's all over . Toth ! It 's not gonna be OK for Toth .

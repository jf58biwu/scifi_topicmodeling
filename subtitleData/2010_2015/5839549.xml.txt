 NOLAN : Previously on Defiance ... Rafe McCawley 's got the right idea about you people . ( SCREAMING ) Hyatt , run ! Ahhh ! I 've taken your mines . Give me a reason to take more . You will deliver my orders exactly as I give them . Your one and only job is keeping me alive . Oh ? DOC : Why else do you think I got your pasty ass out of prison ? ( SPEAKING CASTITHAN ) The master returns . ( SIGHING ) ( STRUGGLING ) ( PUNCHING ) ( COUGHING ) ( PANTING ) Hello . My name is Niles Pottinger . And welcome to the Badlands . We are currently transporting the latest , most advanced mineral extraction equipment from Cedars to the boom-town of Defiance . It 's a small town , big of heart . Let 's swap sides . My right side is ... It 's infinitely more camera-friendly . Maybe , but the terraformed rock over your shoulder ? It creates a sense of groundedness . And people like their leaders down-to-earth . Do you know , Captain , New York is whispering about you . Is that a good thing or bad thing ? Seems the viceroy is quite taken with your latest film . Thank you , sir . Sometimes I 'm worried they 're a little over the top . Nonsense . As a great Old Earth philosopher once said , " The extreme always seems to make an impression . " Hmm . ( GUNSHOTS ) ( GRUNTING ) ( BRAKES SCREECHING ) ( GUNSHOTS ) Get down ! ( GRUNTING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( CONTINUED GUNFIRE ) ( GRUNTING ) ( HEAVY BREATHING ) ( ENGINE ROARING ) ( ENGINE REVVING ) Stay down . ( DOOR SQUEAKING ) This is it . They 're not here for us . They 're here for the equipment . ( GRUNTING ) ( GROANING ) ( GROANING ) Oh , no . Bink , Raul . I think they 're dead . No ! God ! Suck it up ! Get ' em on the truck ! Oh , God . ( GROANING ) ( WHIMPERING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( STRUGGLING ) ( BEEPING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( STRUGGLING ) Please . Look , I haven 't seen your face . POTTINGER : I don 't know who you are ! Shut up ! On your knees . I am a high-ranking officer of the Earth Republic . People owe me favors . If you spare my life , I will guarantee the investigation into this incident is abandoned immediately . High ranking ? Not anymore . I 'm stripping you of your rank . I said strip ! All the way . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( POTTINGER SIGHING ) All the way . Get on your knees . You do not wanna do this . Get on your jekking knees ! You like to hurt people ? ( UNZIPPING ) Piss all over them ? Well , this is what it feels like . ( WHIMPERING ) ( URINATING ) ( HEAVY BREATHING ) What the hell are you doing ? ( SIGHING ) We gotta go ! ( HEAVY BREATHING ) ( ZIPPING ) ( ENGINE STARTING ) ( THEME MUSIC PLAYING ) DATAK : I rarely slept in prison . To help me drift off , I would imagine your face . I 'm glad I left it unmarked . Back on Casti , had I followed the traditions of my father , I would have carved open your belly like he did his first wife . But I am blessed to live in a KWON-yo GYEN-do . A new world , where the love for my wife is reason enough to spare her . I , too , am blessed to live in a KWON-yo GYEN-do , where a man and a woman can stand on equal ground . I raised profits by 20 % while you were away . We should be partners . I have earned that right . Yes . ( SIGHING ) I 'm sure you 'd like that . ( KISSING ) ( SIGHING ) Mmm . ( LAUGHING ) Again ? Seriously ? Practice makes perfect . Oh . I like your work ethic . ( BOTH MOANING ) AMANDA : Oh , no . NOLAN : Mmm ? I have a staff meeting in 10 minutes . I gotta kick you out . ( SIGHING ) You mean , I 'm not getting sex because you have to go work in a whorehouse ? Mmm . The irony is delicious . Hey , kiddo . You didn 't answer your hailer . Yeah , well ... IRISA : The new mayor wants you . Anyone ever teach you to knock ? I was raised by him . That 's a good point . ( LAUGHING ) Ahhh ! ( GRUNTING ) ( AMANDA LAUGHING ) NOLAN : Can you describe the masks these raiders wore ? ( SIGHING ) One wore like an oriental mask , of some sort with these , um , ridiculous antlers . Another one wore a red mask , with shotgun shells sticking out of it , like spikes . It 's from a sport they used to play in , um , Old Canada . America . Ice football or ... Hockey ! I don 't bloody know what it is ! All I know is six of my men are dead , and valuable E-Rep equipment has been stolen and it needs to be found . Now . Well , I wouldn 't get my hopes up there . Raiders tend to move at a pretty fast clip after a hit . They 're probably 500 klicks away by now . Well , then I reckon you better get moving . Take as many men as you need . ( SIGHING ) CHURCHILL : I 'll go . I want to hurt the people who hurt you . Thank you , Churchill . That 's ... That 's very kind . I 'll get you extra petrohol . Crisscrossing the Badlands is a waste of time and , and materials . Look , we need leads . And there was me thinking you were an expert tracker . See , that 's the point . I don 't chase my ass all over the Badlands . Look , Nolan 's right . All right , you 're gonna need an army to cover that much ground . Now your best bet would be to keep your eye on the Black Market from here to AngelArc for any sign of the tech . I don 't remember asking you . You 're my advisor on policy . Not security . Know your place . I 'm glad to see they didn 't kill you . What are you still doing here ? BERLIN : I 'm pretty sure that my camera got a clear shot of the leader 's face when his mask slipped . But unfortunately , my hard drive got smashed . But I think I can fix it . TOMMY : You know , you 've got a bruise there . We should probably get you to the doctor . I was only unconscious for a few minutes . Jessica . Can you call me Berlin , like everyone else ? I don 't like when you get all " Jessica " on me . Well , at least you should lie down . I 'm fine . I have work to do . ( SIGHING ) Did Irisa let you coddle her like this ? No . Irisa 's not the coddling type . You know , I have eyes . I see the way that you look at her . And , the way that she looks at you . Now this must be the head wound talking because ( CLEARS THROAT ) if I had it my way , Irisa and Nolan would be on the first land coach out of town . I want nothing to do with that girl . Good . ( SIGHING ) ( THUDDING ) ( HEAVY BREATHING ) ( PANTING ) Hey , boss . We did it . ( SLAPPING ) You dumb-ass kid ! What the hell were you thinking ? Uncle Rafe , are you seeing this stuff ? This is mining equipment . Votan laser tech that can slice through rock like butter . I know what the hell it is . Those E-Rats want to start cutting through the hard deposits . It 's gonna cause a collapse . We , we could lose hundreds of miners . The E-Rep hasn 't said a word about hitting no hard deposits . Why else would they need to bring this stuff in then ? Look , the E-Rep does not care about Defiance . They 'd just as soon let us fall into the earth . All right . You know who these people are . They killed half my family ! All right , Josef ! Calm down , son . You 're the one who said it ! You said there 's gonna come a time where blood has to be spilled . I didn 't tell you to rob an E-Rep convoy , did I ? Who else was in on this ? Raul , Bink , and O 'Grady . ( SIGHING ) Where are they now ? Raul and Bink didn 't make it . Oh . We buried them in the woods . And then O 'Grady took off for Cedars . We didn 't think that the E-Rep would be able to hit back so hard . Well , what the hell did you expect them to do , offer you a sandwich ? Well , they paid for it . We took out a bunch of their guys . Raul and Bink did not die for nothing . We , we are saving this town . We 're saving lives . You brought this crap into my home ! You know how close they watch me ! I ... I thought you 'd be on my side . Well , you thought wrong . ( SOFT ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO ) It seems my being away has been good for you . It gave you the chance to step out of my shadow , and cast one of your own . After breakfast , we 'll head to the fight tent . You can bring me up to date . Dad , I was just covering for you , while you were gone . I thought that since you 're home now , you 'd want me to step back , and let me focus on my music business . Well , that was before I heard about your ZEM-ba-ko . Once a man has taken a life , he is forever a ZEM-bat-so . You know , Alak , I never envisioned this life for you . I always imagined you in a legitimate occupation , like your music business , where you would prosper and raise a family . A pillar of the community . Hmm . But I was mistaken . For better or for worse , you are a Tarr . My blood runs through your veins . There 's no escaping that . Eat up . I must admit , I do look forward to having someone to talk business with . A man I know I can trust . You 'll see for yourself . The more powerful a man becomes ... CRISP : Hey , you ! ... the fewer his confidantes ... CRISP : Datak Tarr . How the hell are you walking these streets a free man ? I 've been granted parole . Now if you 'll kindly remove yourself from our path ... Colonel Marsh was our C.O. He was a good man . CRISP : He did not deserve to be stabbed to death by a dirty haint . Funny . He used that same word . What , " haint " ? Does the word " haint " bother you ? That 's what you are . You and that haint son of yours . ( SPITTING ) You have every right to be angry . For I have committed a heinous act . While I don 't expect forgiveness , I offer my most sincere apology . ( GRUNTING ) ( SPEAKING CASTITHAN ) By the grace of Rayetso , I offer you my regret . ( SOFT ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ) Back at my office , I was out of sorts . Hmm . A lot of people are out of sorts . It 's no excuse . I value your input . ( SCOFFING ) Truly . That stolen tech must be pretty important . Or is it something else ? One of the raiders . He , um ... He made me strip down . Yeah . It dredged up some old memories I 've spent years trying to forget . Now these memories are back in the front of my brain , as clear as you are in front of me . I 'm gonna tear apart the man who did this to me . You can count on that . You want to talk about it ? I do not . Thank you . Okay . ( SIGHING ) During the war , my parents sent me away to boarding school . To Devon . I was 15 . I think they thought it would be safer down there . So , on a Sunday , bitterly cold , and we had just gotten to chapel . And we were just settling into our pews when , all of a sudden , all the stained glass windows just shattered . And the Votans came . And they locked all the doors , and they kept us in there . No food . No washrooms . For 11 days . The floor was covered in piss and broken glass . And my hands , they got all cut up when they held me down , and they ... ( WHIMPERING ) I 'm so sorry . This world is full of stories like mine . I know . That 's why it 's important to drag them into the light . They do less damage that way . DOC : A bullet hole-in-one , right through the heart . So you got yourself paroled from Camp Reverie , huh ? How exactly did you manage that ? Raw sex appeal . Contusion to the left temple . Last time I checked , E-Rep wasn 't handing out pardons too easily . Well , if you 're worried that I said something about your Irathient godling , the answer is no . Keep it that way . Oh , yeah . Single gunshot . Oddly precise for raiders , isn 't it ? They usually like to fill their victims full of lead . Berlin says her camcorder data looks recoverable . She 's getting close . There 's a boot-print on his shoulder . That looks like gulanite . Nah . Nah , that 's just dirt . What are you doing ? That was gulanite . It 's not gulanite . You just destroyed evidence ! Nah . You want to bury this , so you can protect Rafe McCawley . Nobody 's burying anything . All right ? I 'll take care of it . IRISA : Don 't . You can 't do this . NOLAN : Watch me . You did not provoke him enough . I hocked in his face . We shoved him to the dirt . And he made no move towards you ? Well , he begged our forgiveness with some Casti religious crap . Fine time for him to learn self-control . Hey , hey ! Our scrip ? ( DOOR SHUTTING ) NOLAN : So what can you tell me about a so-called " raider " attack out by Montok Pass ? That 's the first I 've heard of it . E-Rep caravan ? Doesn 't ring a bell ? Nope . See , that girl , Berlin , she caught one of the guys on video . And , me , I 'm certain he 's a miner . Are you now ? Rafe , if you know anything about this , you better come clean with me right now . ( GUN TAPPING ) Make one move and I swear you 're dead . ( SIGHING ) He 's my godson . Go easy on him . Don 't see why I should . Go easy on me ? I 'm the one with the gun ... ( GRUNTING ) ( STRUGGLING ) ( GUN COCKING ) That 's what I 'm talking about . Hands where I can see ' em , Rafe . JOSEF : He had nothing to do with this ! Did I ask you to talk ? He lost family to the E-Rep . It 's a legitimate beef . Where 's the equipment ? It 's out back in his truck . RAFE : Look , Nolan . I 'm the one to blame here . I got the kid all wound up , shooting off my mouth . He 's a good kid . He just got in over his head . You take out a gun , you put on a mask and you rob people , things have a tendency of getting ugly , Rafe . ( HANDCUFFS LOCKING ) NOLAN : I 'm sorry . This kid killed people . RAFE : You know , when they took my mines away , I could 've appealed . But that wasn 't an option . I was labeled an enemy combatant because I shot at E-Rep soldiers to protect Irisa . I don 't know what they want her for . I still don 't . And I don 't care . But I fought for her because it was the right thing to do . ( SIGHING ) I figured you 'd do the same for me . Or was I wrong ? ( SIGHING ) Right now , that Captain Rainier is up in the Darby building ... ( HANDCUFFS UNLOCKING ) ... reconstructing a video camera hard drive that clearly , buddy , shows your face . The second that data is recovered , you are burned in this town forever . You understand ? You get your godson on a land coach , give him enough cash to disappear . RAFE : Nolan ? Yeah ? Thanks . ( CLEARS THROAT ) ( DOOR CLOSING ) Open the cell . Well , well , well . Where did you find this ? A little cave up in Wolf Canyon . All those years of scavenging , I got pretty good at finding raider stash points . No doubt . NOLAN : So , if I were you , which I 'm not , I 'd send some men up to that cave ASAP . All neat and tidy . ( SIGHING ) Except for one thing . Mmm-hmm ? How do you explain the gulanite dust on my dead soldier ? Ah . That was dirt . ( CAGE DOOR SLAMMING ) POTTINGER : That 's not what Deputy LaSalle claims . Hmm . NOLAN : Deputy LaSalle . You gave me the badge , right ? You wanted me to do the job . NOLAN : Well , if you want to believe him over me , here . Here 's the badge . Give it to Tommy . POTTINGER : Keep it . But I want this matter resolved . ( DOOR OPENING ) ( DOOR CLOSING ) Come on , kiddo . Let 's go resolve the matter . DATAK : In my absence , my son has risen to the occasion . So I am pleased to announce that we will now be working side-by-side . Each of you are my family as well . But you have disappointed me . You betrayed me . You ignored the instructions I sent from prison . Instead , you followed the orders of a woman . My wife . OZIN : With all respect , Favi Tarr , we were answering to Alak . DATAK : Shh . Don 't lie to me . What is a man to do when all of his men equally dishonor him ? Does a general slaughter his own troops ? Our Castithan forefathers grappled with this very same problem . And they ... They had a wise solution . The one bears the shame of the many . One soldier , one ax , one grave . So , Vizu , who shall it be ? What ? Hmm ? Should it be Raiga ? Well , he 's been with us five years . Stop . Or what about Giemo ? Well , he used to babysit you . Change your nappies . Of course , not without complaining . He ... He was always grumbling about one thing or another . Well , you could put an end to that right now . Stondak Tiralo . ( SIGHING ) Tell Alak what you say about his little radio station , Ston . Hmm ? He thinks your music is fushtako . I 've made a decision ! Kill me . I could have stopped Mom . But I didn 't . I was weak . ( SIGHING ) That you were . ( GASPING ) ( GURGLING ) ( PANTING ) But you are my legacy . ( GASPING ) ( CROWD MURMURING ) Clean this up and open the tent . Josef , I got your ticket . You 're lucky . It 's the last one . Josef ? Ah , Jesus . Where are you ? ( ELECTRONIC STATIC AND WHIRRING ) JOSEF : Don 't turn around . I just want the camera and the data . And we won 't have any problems . Since you asked nicely . ( GRUNTING ) Ahhh ! ( GRUNTING ) ( GUN COCKING ) Argh ! ( PANTING ) You weren 't supposed to see me . ( SNIFFING ) ( HEAVY BREATHING ) ( LOCKING ) Amanda 's here . Show her in . Here . Mmm . POTTINGER : Your boy Nolan claims the perpetrators are still at large , whereabouts unknown . ( SIGHING ) Last part 's a lie . You want me to speak to him ? ( POTTINGER SIGHING ) No , there 's no need . ( SIGHING ) He found the equipment . In the end , that 's all that matters . ( COUGHING ) ( LAUGHING ) I know you don 't believe that . Hmm . Yeah , the E-Rep really give a damn about my childhood traumas . ( SIGHING CONTENTEDLY ) When you close your eyes , do you see the V.C. soldiers ? The ones who attacked you ? Sometimes . Yeah , I suppose I do . Hmm . I see a bright light . A white blinding light . As in God ? ( LAUGHING ) No . No . No , it 's a man , with a powerful flashlight . What man ? The man who raped me . When ? I was living in New York , working as an entry clerk at E-Rep headquarters . I was coming home one night . It was late . I could sense someone behind me . He blinded me with a bright light . He put a hand around my mouth and a gun in my back . And ... ( SIGHING ) Uh , I ... I don 't know what to say . ( GRUNTING ) Well , I didn 't tell anyone . In politics , looking weak , being a victim , it can ruin a career . So , I kept quiet . I didn 't even tell my fiancé . Poor Connor had no idea . Connor ? As in Connor Lang ? Yes . ( LAUGHS SOFTLY ) Did you know him ? Everyone knew him . Or of him . ( LAUGHING ) Yeah . Well , life went back to normal , until I missed my period . I let Connor believe it was his . But that thing was growing inside of me . So , I got rid of it . ( SIGHING ) Connor couldn 't understand . I mean , how could he ? ( LAUGHING ) I was lying to him . ( SIGHING ) So our relationship ended . I took my sister and we traveled west . And the rest , as they say , is history . ( SNIFFLING ) Why are you telling me this ? I didn 't want you to think you 're alone . Because you 're not . That 's the kindest thing anyone 's ever done for me . ( SIGHING ) Thank you . Yeah . ( DOOR OPENING ) They took Berlin . NOLAN : I will find her . I will bring her back safe . Raiders didn 't do this . Who are you protecting , Nolan ? Is it Rafe ? Is it Rafe McCawley behind this ? No . I can promise you that . You didn 't find that equipment in a cave , did you ? You got me . I found it in town . Down a spider hole out near Rayoon Gulch . NOLAN : I just thought if you knew it wasn 't actual raiders , you would have had your soldiers going door to door , busting the whole town up . Somebody was bound to get hurt . If I had you sent down to Reverie or , better still , shot in the head , it would break Amanda 's heart . And I 'm not willing to do that at the moment . ( SIGHING ) Lie to me again , though , I will revise that policy . Are you done here ? 'Cause I have a woman to rescue . I lied for you , Rafe . To the mayor and Tommy . I owe you , Nolan . NOLAN : Yeah , you wanna pay me back , you figure out where that kid 's holed up . I have a few ideas . NOLAN : Well , hurry . And , Rafe , if anything happens to that E-Rep girl , you and me , we got blood on our hands . I hear you . ( HAILER CLICKING OFF ) ALAK : So this is where the records get manufactured . DATAK : Interesting . The presses were all rebuilt from salvaged parts . I got them for practically nothing . And now we have an output of 2,000 units per week . " Tarr Traxx . " Cute . I 'll be honest with you , son . When we started today , my intentions were quite different . You , uh , see those canisters ? Where did those come from ? I had them delivered . I was determined to burn this place to the ground . Your complicity with your mother earned that at the very least . Dad , uh ... But you have shown me much . This business serves as a useful front . and that little show you put on back at the fight tent . Offering your life to save your men . Clever boy . Give me your hand , son . You have impressed me , Alak . And I 'm not easily impressed . But I cannot let your transgressions go unpunished . ( GRUNTING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( FLESH SIZZLING ) Everything I 've said is true . And now that your debt has been discharged , we shall begin again , together . ( SCREAMING ) ( WHIMPERING ) Best put some ice on that . He 's been home for one day . Christie ... One day , and he does this to you ? I told you . I 'm ... I 'm fine . I want him to suffer ! Look , this is my fault , okay ? I brought this upon myself . Alak , you did not deserve this . You don 't understand . I totally understand . Your father is a monster . Stop it ! Okay ? You ... You don 't get it . You 're not Castithan . Do you really believe that ? Alak , what happened to your hand ? It ... It was an accident . ( SPEAKING CASTITHAN ) I would spit on the holy Casti bible before I 'd ever again open its pages . ( SPEAKING ENGLISH ) Those were your words , were they not ? I inherited this copy from a prisoner who met an untimely end . I was curious . What combination of words would make a man sacrifice his life for his beliefs ? So I began to read . And to my surprise , the holy teachings resonated with me . Rayetso demands that no misdeed go unpunished . The FU-da-no at the academy taught us that lesson quite well . But to scar our son ! You have turned into your father . My father would 've done worse . Did worse . But his ministrations made me stronger . The holy teachings to which he adhered to have been around for thousands of vigo . For good reason . They kept order . They maintained balance . Words , Datak . That is all they are . Ancient words . As long as I 've known you , you 've lacked all sense of balance . Yes . In the past , I have upset the equilibrium more times than I care to admit . ( SIGHING ) I regret killing Colonel Marsh . But you and our son have misbehaved as well . And now that we 've all been humbled before Rayetso , we can all move forward together as a family . You should embrace me now . ( HEAVY BREATHING ) BERLIN : " Cutting through the hard deposits will cause the mines " to cave in and shockwaves will trigger a massive ... " I 'm not reading this . These are lies . It 's all true . And once people see an E-Rep soldier admit it , they 'll rise up . If what you 're saying is actually true , you could have just made a public statement . Hmm . I tried that . Wrote on a wall and almost died for it . You wrote , " Kill the E-Rep . " If you want to sway public opinion , you spread the truth . Yeah , so says the queen of propaganda . You don 't make fans when you kill innocent soldiers ! E-Rep soldiers are not innocent ! Private Brandon Grabe had a wife , Annabel , and two kids , Ross and Galen . Shut up . Sergeant August Crown sent half his weekly pay home to his mother and three nephews whose mom died at Ridgeback . I said shut up ! And they 're gonna have trouble eating , because you killed their breadwinner . Private Molly Chang ... Stop talking ! ( GRUNTING ) Bitch ! ( STRUGGLING ) You 're playing me ? I was trying to be reasonable ! ( SCREAMS ) ( GRUNTING ) Fuck ! You screwed yourself . ( PANTING ) I 'm sorry . NOLAN : Hey kid ! ( YELLING ) ( GUNSHOT ) ( STRUGGLING ) ( MOANING ) ( GRUNTING ) No ! ( HANDCUFFS LOCKING ) ( GRUNTING ) Nolan , you okay ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . I 've been hit worse . All right , stay down . I 'll get the doc . Let 's go . ( GRUNTING ) You should 've gotten on that land coach . Defiance is my home . I can 't just let them drive me out . You have to . Now go on . ( HANDCUFFS UNLOCKING ) Run ! What ? Just go . Uncle R , you gotta lead these people . You have to get them to fight . ( WHIMPERING ) Son , just go . Just ... Just go ! Thank you . ( CRYING ) ( GROANING ) ( SIZZLING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( GROANING ) How 's that head of yours ? Nothing a couple shots of willow bark can 't fix . ( LAUGHING ) You know , I don 't take what you did lightly . You took a bullet for me and I won 't ever forget that . Ah , anytime , kid . ( LAUGHING ) Thank God you 're okay . Thank him . Thank you . I appreciate it . Well , maybe you wanna keep that in mind next time you 're thinking about stabbing me in the back . Hey . So . POTTINGER : He was warned . AMANDA : He shot the kid himself . Josef is dead . You got your payback . It 's not enough . Rafe is not the one who hurt you . It 's a cruel world . ( AMANDA SIGHING ) ( DOOR OPENING ) Hello , my love . ( WOMAN SINGING IN CASTITHAN ) They 're just innocent victims They 're just innocent victims They 're just innocent victims ... Do not look away . ( GROANING ) You should have made me a partner .

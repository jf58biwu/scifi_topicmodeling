 ( LOUD BUZZING DRONE ) BENDER : This has been a test of the Emergency Hypnotoad System . Had this been an actual hypnosis , you would go limp and watch whatever crap comes on next . Coming up next , Futurama ! ( SNAPS FINGER ) ( FLY BUZZING ) Professor , my Fry-fro is all frizzy . Okay . Well , that 's all . Also , I 'm covered with severe burns . So ? What of it ? Well , why is those things ? ( GASPS ) You mean , you don 't remember ? Nope . Nothing . It 's like when I passed out in college , except no one drew Magic Marker penises on my forehead . Well , ( SIGHS ) I suppose it 's for the best , considering the unbearable horrors you 've endured . Let 's never speak of it again . It all began a few days ago . We were interstellar fugitives on the run from the law . Fire all weapons and open a hailing frequency for my victory yodel . ( ALL SCREAMING ) ( ZAPP YODELING OVER INTERCOM ) ( SHUDDERS ) FARNSWORTH : And so , as you and Leela kissed goodbye in a tender display of tonguesmanship , we plunged into a massive wormhole , never to be seen again . Yeah , we 're back . ( ALL CHEERING ) Sweet coincidence of Port-au-Prince , we 're back at Earth ! Of course ! That was the Panama wormhole ! Earth 's central channel for shipping . ( CHUCKLING ) How humorous . Yes , it 's sort of a Comedy Central channel . And we 're on it now ! I get it ! ( ZAPP YODELING ) We 've lost power to the forward Game Boy . Mario not responding ! Brace for emergency landing ! Roger that . Activate safety spheres ! Also , mine has air conditioning . ( ZAPP YODELING ) Yet , thanks to my trusty safety sphere , I sublibed with only tribial brain dablage . And the others ? Right here , behind this horror-cloth . Are they dead ? No , no , no , no . Much worse . ( FRY SCREAMS ) Move over , God ! Prepare for rebirth ! ( SCREAMS ) Wrong switch . Come on , stem cells , work your astounding scientific nonsense . Fetal stem cells ? Aren 't those controversial ? In your time , yes , but nowadays , shut up ! Besides , these are adult stem cells harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stem cells . ( GRUNTING ) Hermes Conrad ! ( CRYING ) Man ! I 'm dripping with placenta . Good thing it 's Casual Friday . Amy Wong ! Ooh ! Baby soft . Indeed . Dr. Zoidberg ! Hermes , my friend . Let me cut off your umbilical cord . ( SNAPPING ) Oops . FRY : And the rest ! Hooray ! We 're back in business . Over my dead body . Uh , never mind . ( BENDER GRUNTING ) Bender , are the stem cells working ? Ow ! I 'm dying . ( COUGHS ) I need mouth-to-ass resuscitation . I 'm on it ! ( INHALES ) ( BLOWING ) ( MUFFLED ) It 's not working ! ( CHUCKLING ) I die happy knowing you fell for that . His power supply is shut . He 's flatlining ! ( BEEPING ) Only one thing can keep him alive . Possibly this thing . ( POWER SURGING ) Whoo ! I 've never felt so energetic ! ( SCATTING ) That 's because the doomsday device I shoved all up in you puts out 50 gigawatts . That 's 10 times your recommended ... Who are you , my warranty ? ( CHUCKLES ) That was a good ... ( LAUGHING ) ( POWER SURGING ) Huh ? For God sakes , Bender , keep dancing ! Keep whooping it up ! ( POWERING DOWN ) You must burn off the doomsday energy as fast as it 's produced , or it will build to critical levels ! ( GASPS ) You don 't mean ... Oh , but I do . If you stop partying for a single second , you 'll explode and kill everyone here in a fireball of melted gears and splattered bowels ! Sounds like a party , baby ! Ooh , yeah ! Hey , speaking of splattered bowels , can I cook you a romantic dinner tonight , Leela ? Where 's Leela ? Is she okay ? Why hasn 't she acknowledged my dinner offer ? Something 's wrong ! She 's not responding to my poking stick . Poke harder , damn it ! I 'm poking as hard as I can ! I 'm sorry , Fry , but I 'm afraid Leela is in an irreversible coma . ( SINGING ) Coma , coma , coma , coma , coma chameleon ( SNIFFLES ) My soul mate is gone . Why should I go on living ? Because the pain slowly fades , but the love is forever . Yow ! But what if I forget the sweet sound of her voice , or the moist touch of her eyeball on my lips ? Are you still hung up on what 's-her-name ? Move on already ! Maybe you 're right . Maybe I 'm always right . " Build-a-Bot Workshop . " It 's time to start living again . At least it 's something to distract me from Leela . Nah . Now , that I like for some reason . ( SOBBING ) I like jelly beans . Do you ? I sure do , honey . Come now , Fry , you can 't live out this sick fantasy . Not without our help . These security tapes record everything at Planet Express , including the ship , shower and urinals . And yet , it still hasn 't stopped the elusive bathroom burglar . Maybe he 's just trying to feed his family . Computer , analyze tapes and extract personality profile of one Turanga Leela . COMPUTER : Analyzing . Analyzing . Checking my eBay bid . ( BUZZER SOUNDING ) Damn it ! Analysis complete . Hey , I was nuzzling that . COMPUTER : Attributes transferred . Shoe size 12 . Et cetera . Brace for emergency landing ! What ? We survived the crash ? Oh , Fry ! Party people in the house say ... ( GASPING ) This is wonderful . The last thing I remember , I was dying in an explosion . Yet , here I am in the flesh , more alive than ever . Alive ? ( CLEARING THROAT ) You better tell her , Fry . Tell me what ? Anyway , my work is done . I 'm gonna hit the showers . ( SNIFFING ) ( WHIMPERS ) Nibbler . Come , give Mama a hug . ( GROWLING ) What the ... Bad Nibbler ! Bad Nibbler ! What 're you doing , pooper doodle ? It 's me , Leela ! ( SCREAMING ) ( CONTINUES SCREAMING ) ( CONTINUES SCREAMING ) ( PANTING ) Am I really just a robot ? I mean , I have Leela 's memories . Her opinion of gazelles , majestic . Her emotions , confused and hurt . I swear , I didn 't know this would happen . The only thing I truly know is I love you . I mean , her . Wait , help me out here . ( DISCO MUSIC PLAYING ) ( PEOPLE EXCLAIMING ) Do the Bender ! Do the Bender ! No , thank you . I said , do it ! The truth is , Fry , I still have feelings for you . But are they really my feelings ? Am I just an automaton , or can a machine of sufficient complexity legitimately achieve consciousness ? I agree . I need some time to figure this out . Until then , friends ? Okay . Listen up , disco dummies ! You just flunked out of Bender 's College of Party Knowledge . ( WHOOPING ) ( SCATTING ) BENDER : Yeah , baby ! Do the back dance , do the back dance . ( GROANING ) FARNSWORTH : Good news , everyone . I 'm going to make one final attempt to awaken Leela . ( ALL CHEERING ) After all , there 's always hope . Really ? No , don 't get your hopes up . Frankly , she 's just a brainless mound of scabs and puss . ( EXCLAIMS ) I didn 't need to hear that . No , and you don 't need to see this . AUTOMATED VOICE : Wake up ! Wake up ! Wake up ! Wake up ! ( HORNS BLOWING ) Wake up ! Wake up ! Wake up ! Wake up ! Well , that 's it . I 'm afraid traditional medicine has failed . No ! I refuse to give up ! Wake up , Leela ! I love you ! Fry , stop . She 's gone . Dr. Zoidberg , can you note the time and declare the patient legally dead ? Can I ? That 's my specialty ! As you all know , Leela 's living will states that in the event of coma , her body is to be fed to the wild cyclophage , a highly endangered creature that eats only Cyclopses . Yup , that 's what her donor card says . Goodbye , my love . ( SOBBING ) ( BIRDS CAWING ) ( RUMBLING ) The beast approacheth ! ( SINGING ) To the beat , y 'all To the beat , y 'all I 'm dancing a jig with my feet , y 'all Bender , cut it out . People are trying to have emotions . You think I want to party ? I 'm sick of partying . Woo-hoo ! More partying ! ( BEAT BOXING ) Quiet , Bender . Cut it out . ( BELCHES ) Bender ! Shut the hell up ! ( POWER SURGING ) Bender ! Stop shutting the hell up ! Right . Leela 's back , as if I care . ( SARCASTICALLY ) Whoo ! All right , Leela ! ( ALL CHEERING ) ( SIGHS ) Thanks . It 's so nice to wake up and see ... ( GASPS ) Leela ! Leela ? Leela ? Leela . How is this possible ? And can you believe she wore a tank top to my funeral ? Shut up ! We got to get out of here ! ( ROARING ) No , you shut up , we got to get out of here . ( ALL SCREAMING ) Yeah , baby . Come on ! All aboard the party ship ! There 's no room for two captains ' butts in this chair . There would be if you 'd taken a spin class instead of lounging around in a coma ! LEELA : This is crazy . It 's like I 'm looking at an exact robot duplicate of myself . That is what you 're looking at . Oh . How could you do this , Fry ? ( STAMMERS ) Coma ... Sad ... I have to go . This is just too freaky ! Please don 't get upset , Leela . She 's nothing like you . I have to go . This is just too freaky . I need cheering up , Bender . I don 't know , do you want to go out and party tonight ? I hate partying . If only I didn 't have so much crunk in my badonkadonk . Yeah . Come on , baby . Why does everything I date run away ? I love Leela , always and forever , and if I loved robot Leela , too , well , that 's only ' cause she had so much of real Leela in her . I thought she loved me , too , but , obviously , I was wrong as usual . Wrong again . You were right . Leela ? Leela-Leela ? Leela-Leela . I 've been thinking , Fry . If I lost you , I don 't think I could stand it , either . I 'd probably build a copy of you , too . As long as robo-Leela 's not a jealous type like me , things will ... I 'll kill you , you slut-clops ! ( EXCLAIMS ) He 's mine ! Back off , missy ! ( BOTH GRUNTING ) Somebody do something ! Here , take this ! A gun ? Do I really need to ... Shoot her ! She 's the robot ! No ! Shoot her ! She 's the human ! But how do I know who 's the human and who 's the robot ? We just told you ! Yeah , you idiot ! Okay . Fine . If you 're going to be like that , I 'm not shooting anyone . ( GROANS ) Right between the lungs . Man , that was close . ( SCREAMS ) ( SCATTING ) I 'm a robot , too ! Aha ! That explains this growth on your drive shaft ! But how is this possible ? Who knows ? Oh , I do . Allow me to explain what really happened the day the ship crashed . I 'll protect you , Leela . My love is stronger than the vast majority of explosions . FARNSWORTH : Fry did , in fact , save Leela , though at a terrible cost to himself . I tossed him into the stem cells , but he just bubbled away like phlegm on a hot sidewalk . Leela was so distraught , she went all Blade Runner and built a duplicate . Then , uploaded Fry 's personality from the urinal surveillance tapes . I sure love Leela . FARNSWORTH : Alas , in recreating Fry 's adorable jelly-belly , she had overstuffed him with copper wadding . The inevitable static discharge electrocuted Leela , and destroyed both of their short-term memories . So that 's why I 'm so amazed by these things I already knew . FARNSWORTH : What could I do ? I hung up Leela with the other bone bags and went to procure the final ingredient for my stem cell brew . ( FLY BUZZING ) Professor , my Fry-fro is all frizzy . My God ! I can 't believe I 'll never see that particular Fry again . Hey , where 's my shoes ? ( ALL GASPING ) Fry ? I 'm sorry . I didn 't realize I was already here . Wait , what 's with all the Leelas ? Trust me , don 't ask . Okay , dork . Listen , I 'm going to hit the urinal , maybe talk about myself a little bit ... Hang on . It 's time to sort things out . The truth is , I love Fry . That Fry . And I love Leela . Any Leela . We 're robots , and we 're in love . Let 's ditch these meat jackets . Whoa ! Cool ! ( IMITATING TERMINATOR ) Hasta la vista , wiener . ( IMITATING TERMINATOR ) We 'll be back , for our stuff . Why did their voices change ? That 's the one thing we 'll never truly understand . Uh , this is a bit awkward . Or is it ? I 'm not sure . I lost track around the second robot . Well , you know how I feel . I waited for you for 1,000 years , I can wait a little longer . ( BLOWS RASPBERRY ) What a load a mush ! I 've had it . ( POWER SURGING ) ( GASPS ) He 's gonna blow ! Party , Bender ! Party for your life ! No chance , high-pants ! I 'd rather die and kill all of you than party for one more millisecond ! ( ALL SCREAMING ) The Cyclops-eater ! ( GASPS ) Hold on , man ! It ain 't like that ! Geez . What does it take to kill me ? Bender , you blew out your excess capacity . You 're cured ! Sweet mercy ! My hellish nightmare is over ! I never have to party again . Well , that 's that then . We 're back , everyone ! Party ! ( ALL CHEERING ) Yeah ! Whee ! ENGLISH - US - PSDH

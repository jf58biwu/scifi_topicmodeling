 Dr Zulkowski , heres the testimony for the budget hearing . As long as the changes were made I dont need to see it . Did we get the increase in the Mars Exploration Program ? The additional funding could mean a new structural support . I hope the White House backs this . Whats the status of the comet ? Dr Sadoughian should have a full report for you . Good , good . - Morning , Peter . - Morning , Stan . - Morning , Ali . How goes it ? - The images from the Hubble ... were clear as a day , enough to do the 3D modeling . Good work . Close enough for a texture map if she passes near the Rover . The comets orbital path travels closer than we anticipated . - How much closer ? - A couple thousand miles . Close enough for us to get a few pretty pictures . - Lots of pretty pictures . - Keep Senate hearings at a minimum . - l think you should see this . - Hes talking to you . Morning , Rhodes . What you got ? This doesnt make sense . The comet made a turn . - A turn ? - lt completely shifted its orbit . Comets dont shift unless the sun shifts . Let me see that . Switch screen to Rover images . Rotate all cameras 90o positive . My God . Cups of flour . 2 teaspoons . Brown sugar . Nutmeg . - Why dont you use the mix ? - Mines better . - But you never made it before . - Yes I have . 672 times . - Hey , Dad - Good morning , son . Can you pick me up at 6 ? I joined a new club . No . Drive your car or ask your mother . lm not driving my car . Smells like mildew . Suck it up , young man . Youre lucky to have any car . Whipper snapper . Mr President ? We have a situation . - Just use the mix . - Mines better . - What are you guys up to now ? - Nothing . I told him to use the mix . - Clean it up before mom returns . - its good . - Oh ! - What ? - Déja vú . - Whos that ? Brain perceives events and processes them as memories . What did he say ? Terry , I have to go earlier today . Can you take Sam to the bus please ? - l can get myself on the bus . - Terry ? - Okay . - Your uncle is an insurance policy . - l can do it myself . - Pipe down , tater tot . - Wanna go ? - Yeah . Bye , sweetie . - Eggs were amazing , Terry . - Better than the mix . Thank you . - What the hell is that ? - l dont know , but ill find out . Wicked . I was on the phone with Washington . NASA and FFAA officials are coming . We need every monitoring device . Every astronomer looking for debris that could be a problem . Any after-effect that could cause a danger . The Russians , Japanese and Chinese are also on the same program . - What do we know so far ? - Aftershock and radiation waves ... are approaching our planet . Worldwide problems with devices ... - cell phones , satellites . - Make sure landlines and ... fiber optic connections are functioning properly . We cant tell how bad the impact is just yet . Were repositioning the Hubble . As long as the TDRSS System works ... well pull good results without waiting for the planet to rotate . Did you run any debris and impact simulations ? A piece the size of a house would impact at 11 km per second . Thats big enough to destroy any major city . - Rhodes . - Were missing the point . A comet just slammed into Mars . The debris is likely to enter ... the Earths gravitational pull and cause a massive extinction . lm trying to find a solution . What is not clear to you , Rhodes ? What caused the comet to change course ? Something out there ... is capable of altering the path of a fifty-kilometer body . This comet reaches its perihelion every 4200 years . Whats out there that wasnt there 4200 years ago ? Nothing is worse for your rep than driving a stinky car . - When I get out , I smell good . - You dont smell like cheese ? - Cause you do a little bit . - lt never stops . - Oh , crap ! Theres Lindsey - New girlfriend ? Let me see . Dad , stop , stop ! Can you just pull forward ? - Youre the man ... - Just pull forward . Cmon , Leo. I gotta get to work . Get out , get out . Just , please pull forward . - lll tell you when they turn . - Okay . - You ready ? Go . - Dad . - Dad , you swear ? - Youre gonna lose your window . Lindsey ! Be good . Anyone home ? Samantha , why arent you at school ? - Did you miss your bus ? - Terry says the bus isnt safe . - What ? - Said it made a strange noise . Timing chains sounded off . School bus needs repair . He can teach me more in a day than they would in school . Thats a very sweet offer , but Sam has to go to school . Grab your stuff , lm taking you . Go , go , go ! - Good morning , lady . - Good morning , Mr. Mayor . - ls that for me ? - The economic development plan . Which has made me look smarter than I am , I hope . - l tried . - Just give me the final final . We covered the main points and I trust you with it . - lll work on it . - See you at the council meeting . - Okay . - And then well go in with it . - Thanks , Erica . - Youre welcome . - Morning , Roz . - Morning , Ben . Anything pressing before the council meeting ? People want to know why the sky is freaky-deeky . - Did you see that ? - Mr . Dudley thinks theyre aliens . Tell them to watch TV . Fox and CNN have something on it . In this town everybody comes here to solve their problems . I pledged to fill potholes and lower taxes ... not handle extraterrestrials . iii see what I can find out . The satellite tracks its orbit updating every 6 minutes . The anomaly had to either rotate or move into position ... to directly affect the comets path . Why did it have to move ? Couldnt it just have been there ? If the force was omni-directional it would have influenced Mars ... or its 2 moons. I think theres a gravity funnel ... which exerts force in a limited direction . Where did it come from ? And where is it going ? We plotted some potential paths and orbits , look at it . In 96 hours itll exert full force upon its landing . In 10 hours itll affect the moon , therell be huge tidal shifts . - Tsunamis , typhoons , hurricanes ... - And after that , who knows ? Were in uncharted territory here . I dont know what this is let alone how to stop it . The guys from Washington are here I dont like living them such news . Before the cell phone network goes to shit ... we should call in the experts who specialize in this . What experts ? We put a man on the moon . We need the unified theory . We need the string guys . Well , then get them . Do you know where to find them ? - Well compare notes . - Well get them , sir . Thats weird . Theres never traffic on the 49 . Shouldnt take 49 . Should take University . - Whys that ? - Sams bus takes 49 . The bus has problems . People drive too fast on Johnston . We need to put a stop signal . Mr. Dudley , this is the 3rd time you brought up this issue . Theres no reason to put the stop sign there . Bring a motion forward next time to lower the speed limit . Thats a great idea , Ben . Thanks . Proposed remodeling of the library on Pinhook . Theyre here . Wanna speak with them first ? - Absolutely . - Great . Come in . - Hey . How are you doing ? - l tried to call you . All the phones are down . You got time for lunch ? Lets do that . Grab a jacket . Trish Zane . Tom Lively . This is Dr. Zulkowski . Thank you both for coming . Weve had an anomaly . We hope that you can help us stop it . Stop it ? That sounds dangerous . Representatives from the military and the NSA are on their way . We hope to have some answers by the time they arrive . Well be asking a lot of you in very short a time . Anything we can get for you to move the process along , name it . I need some no . 2 pencils and some wide-line paper . No notebook , no college ruled . Loose leaves of paper . - Okay ? Trish . - Energy drinks and cigarettes . - Any particular brand ? - Surprise me . - None of that generic crap . - They need to be ... menthol . - Can you keep the drinks warm ? - Room temperature anyway . - Please . - Well have that brought over . - Thank you . - Thank you . iii have Rhodes here get you up to speed . No. 2 pencils and energy drinks ? is this some kind of joke ? Those two are the rock stars of theoretical physics . 6 years ago Trish Zane was laughed out of mit for proposing M theory . Her hypothesis was confirmed by research 6 months ago . - Theyre brilliant . - Well I certainly hope so . - Go home . See your family - lve got work to do . Besides , its the end of the world , lll be fine . - That quiz was a real ball buster . - He loves springing staff on us . - lm probably failing right now . - You should sit next to me . What does that mean ? Youre making me smarter by osmosis ? - The tests are multiple choice . - Yes . We can create a secret language like I scratch my head ... the answers A , if I sneeze , the answer is B. I need your test results before I start copying your answers . Make sure youre not trying to impress me . Suit yourself , but , I got a secret weapon . - And what is that ? - My uncle . - Your uncles a math teacher ? - No . Better . Hes a savant . He has a kind of autism . He has no good motor skills . He lacks the brain part that filters out useless information . - Yes , he knows everything . - You lie . - No , I swear . - What , like Rainman ? Better than Rainman . I would not lie to you . - Thats pretty wild . - Well , its pretty true . Oh , man . - Whats his problem ? - Dont get me started . - You broke up like last summer ? - Tell me about it , right ? He shouldnt have a problem with your new boyfriend . - New boyfriend , huh ? - Did I just say that ? Yeah . - Margaret . - lve seen that face before . Another story to hit the Internet ? What do you regret this time ? - No , its not that . - Well , what ? - What is it ? - An extinction level event . - We have a day . Maybe two . - Before what ? They dont know . We need to get back to Washington . - Mr . President . - Carson . Members of the Cabinet are ready to reconvene . Good. I just told Margaret we need to get back . The Secret Service thinks its unsafe for you to fly . I dont care what they think . Were going back . This is a national crisis . The American people deserve ... to have their president in the White House ... not hiding out in some secret location . The American people need their president , sir . The FAA has suspended all travel until further notice . Set it up here , in the hotel . But keep the vice president ... - in D. C. - Yes , sir . My God . What are we going to do ? Jumping into a ready-made family is difficult . Can you talk to him ? Samantha is too young to remember her mom ... but Leo misses her . Hes a great kid but he wont respect me . Take him fishing or take him to Hooters , do something ... - to get him on my side . - Well do . - Well , Terry sure misses you . - Still gets letters from Houston ? - Emails them every day . - l think thats kind of cute . Till the Feds send a SWAT team to bust him for stalking . Yeah . He needs something to do . We need global coordination . I want briefings every 10 minutes . We have a few hours satellite telecommunications left . Then fire up the old Cold War infrastructure . We cannot do this alone . Mobilize the National Guard . We need to maintain law and order . I want every governor kept in ... the loop as long as possible . There is no plan for any of this . We need to act from our gut and just hope and pray ... we made the right decision . Please dont sit there . Please use a chair . Youll mess up the sheets . iii have to make the bed . Sorry . What are you working on ? I have a friend . Reflex 1987 . He works at the Space Agency . I wanna work there and use my computer . Those guys have computers even better than yours . No . amiga has a superior operating system . Lynne and I wanna give you some stuff to do around the house . Maybe work on getting you your drivers license . - l dont wanna drive . - Youd make a great driver . Id make an excellent driver . Other drivers are bad . - You have a point . - l wanna work there . The Atlas Space Agency . They need me . I know you do . Well talk about this again tomorrow . Okay . Bye . Love you . I love you too . Leo said the Internet was down . I rerouted my terminal through another DNS terminal . - lt works . - Good thinking . - My talk with Terry went bad . - Well , as usual . Its like talking to a wall . My dad was frustrated with him . - Like father , like son . - lm not frustrated . Ok , hes frustrating . Its like having another kid . - Were doing ok with the other 2 . - Should we send him for treatment ? No , he belongs with his family . Putting him in a nut house ... - isnt doing him any favors - Who talked about a nut house ? Thats where those centers are . Hows your blood pressure ? - l dont wanna tell you . - Sweetie . - 145 over 98 . - Still pretty high . iii call the doctor tomorrow and adjust my meds . We determined that what you say is not only unlikely . The clearance process for people who are already working on this ... is underway but obviously we cant wait . iii inform our team in Washington . - Okay . - As long as theyre the best . Sorry for the interruption . General Rodgers , Ms. Taylor . - Greetings . - Hello . Ms. Taylor , please take a seat . General , over here please . - Thank you , Stan . - Any updates for us ? - Update ? Like what ? - Whats the situation ? Right . Of course . We worked on some calculations . Thanks for getting so much time . Thats what we came up with ... - sir General ... - General . Super cool suit , by the way . What we came up with is that ... we are ... screwed . One hundred per cent . - lt might not be that bad . - Might not ? - Really ? Go on . - To minimize its impact ... we need to identify it . Know exactly what it is . It takes scientists decades to work this stuff out . All resources of the US govt are at your disposal . Until all the satellites go down all the power is gonna go . Could it be a sort of weapon ? Al Qaeda ? Possibly the Chinese ? No . This is an incident to remind us how insignificant ... we are in the universe . - You have a name for it ? - Yeah . Nothing . Down since yesterday . I dont think so . If your cell phone doesnt work you can use mine . Thanks , sweetie . Wheres Terry ? - Hes been out there all morning . - What time ? He was out there when I got up . Were taking the kids to school . Well see you tonight . - Theres Hot Pockets for dinner . - Bye , Pumpkin . - We made some progress . - its not progress . We just have an idea of whats to come . You better prepare . Go ahead . The anomaly is a gravitational vacuum . - A black hole ? - No , thats omnidirectional . - This has a focal point . - Think of a flashlight . Instead of emitting light it sucks everything in . - We do mean everything . - Everything . - Matter ... anti-matter ... - Light , gravity , time . Hold on . Time ? It sucks time ? Time is one of the 11 dimensions . ltd take us hours to explain . Time is a quantifiable object ... - like space . - Matter . - And gravity . You go . - lt will impact Earth ... - in 48 hours . - And thats it . When it hits us , its zero time . We are gone . We are going down to crunch town . Well be done before that . For humanity anyway . Soon itll exert gravitational pull on the moon and the planet . It will affect weather patterns . The water cycle will be slowed up . A water canopy may be created . Thick atmosphere keeping moisture ... - closer to the planet surface . - Weve depleted the ozone enough ... that its not gonna be catastrophic , but its gonna be ... - be rough . - its gonna be rough . Gravity will be affected and things will grow lighter . As it nears the perihelion its gonna create a large vacuum . On the 1st pass its gonna 2 maybe 3 kilometers deep . It will reach its perihelion and impact the Far East first . - Somewhere between ... - Australia . - And Japan . - Depending on the time ... - and the exact point . - As the Earth rotates its gonna ... rotate right into the vacuum . Even if we survive the first days ... come day three the entire planet will be consumed . - How good is this assessment ? - This is the real deal , sir . iii call the president . Think . All of you . Any chance of stopping this thing ? Thats what we try to do . But it doesnt look good . You wanna do me a favor and take it a little easy on your mom ? Shes my stepmom , ok ? And she can take it easy on me . ltd be nice if you call her mom now and then . Thats never gonna happen . Shes not my mom . - Can I borrow a hundred bucks ? - its not gonna happen . Shes not my mom . Can I borrow a hundred bucks ? What the hell ? Remember the girl you saw yesterday at the school , Lindsey ? The clouds part , all becomes clear . Yeah , I remember Lindsey . I want to take her to dinner this weekend . - Take her to the Fleur-de-Lis . - Fleur-de-Lis ? Why not just fly her to Paris ? You dont need to take her there . - lll pay you back . - With what ? You dont have a job . This summer lm gonna work . - Wait ! Stop the car . - What ? - Dad , just stop the car . - All right . What ? Whats that ? You see that ? - Have you ever seen that ? - No . Never . - Hey , Roz . - Another day of weirdness ? - Very strange . Any calls ? - The governor called first thing . - Wants you to call him back . - Okay , thanks . Back from the dead . Stanley. lm sure youve come to the same conclusion that we have . We must detonate our nuclear assets at the poles ... to reshape the planets axis . This is our only solution . - This Russian plan is a bad idea . - Agreed . Long lasting effects on the planet would be catastrophic . Launching the worlds nuclear arsenal at the N. Pole to knock ... the planet off a few degrees sounds genius to me . - ltll never work . No dice . - Really ? Never ? Man , no dice , you guys . No game , no guts , no game off . - Who is this kook ? - You cannot smoke in here . Didnt you get the email ? The worlds about to end . Dr. Medev was Russian cosmologist Yuri Zelnikov I think his name is . - Hes still alive ? - Hes such a hack . - You know him ? - Everybody knows that Soviet dude . We need to tell our people not to go with this plan . Rebound ! That ball ! Jump ! Get it ! Get it ! That ball ! Jump ! Get it ! Rebound ! That ball ! Jump ! Jump ! Get it ! Get it ! Rebound ! That ball ! - Whoo ! - Hey . Good practice today . See you Thursday ? - Of course ! - Bye Lindsey . Jump ! Jump ! Get it ! Get it ! Rebound ! That ball ! Stop. I hate practicing indoors . Its so hot in here . - Whats going on with the weather ? - l thought you had all the answers . - Are you getting sassy with me ? - Maybe . - What was that ? - So weird . Think its a hurricane ? - l didnt see that on the news . - Didnt see any news . No TV . - Thats true . Good point . - its a very good point . - Can I talk to you for a second ? - Shes already talking to me . - But thanks for interrupting . - l wasnt talking to you . - Stop it , okay ? - Really . Theres nothing to talk about . I deleted your Facebook messages . Its over , so just forget about it and move on . - its not that simple . - Yeah , it is ! ! - Hey Terry . Wheres Ben ? - l need 6 distributor caps . I need 24 sparkplugs . I need 2 truck batteries . - Phone call , line 2 . - Governor ? - No . Earl over at the auto shop . - Okay . Hey Earl ! Your brother Terrys here . Hes buying a bunch of stuff . - Shall I put it on your account ? - Well , whats he buying ? - Sparkplugs and distributor caps . - The governors on the phone . I gotta take this . Let him take whatever he wants . All right . Hello , Richard , how you doing ? Okay , lm sitting down . We worked out calculations and the anomaly may be dark matter . We need the missiles to create a chain reaction to stop this thing . The Russians and the Chinese are putting their plan in motion . They want the US to come onboard . They say their plan can work . They have always been 20 years behind us . We cant use our missiles . We may need them later . - For what ? - Were working on a ... counter offensive for when the thing comes close . iii inform the president . Well save them . iii try to convince the Russians and the Chinese that were not ... taking any strategic advantage by withholding our arsenal . - Wheres your car ? - l didnt drive today . - Want a ride ? - My dad will pick me up . You could call him and tell him youve found a ride ... - but the phone lines are down . - Hed be worried if I wasnt here . - isnt that cute ? - Shut up . You better dont ride in my car . The inside smells like mildew . - So lll see you ? - Okay . - Okay . Bye . - All right . Bye . - Your dad could give me a ride ? - Can I kiss you ? I mean lll give you a ride . While were waiting we could ... Yeah , really like . - Bet I could still pick you up . - Yeah ? lm not that strong . Quick , get in . - Can we give Lindsey a ride ? - Sure , lets go . - ls everything all right ? - Well talk about it . - Did something happen to Terry ? - No . - Nice to meet you , Mr. Marshall . - Sorry , theres a lot going on . - What was that ? - Looks like an earthquake . Come on . - ls anybody in there ? - Please , help me . - Pull her out . - We should wait for the paramedics . - How can we call them ? - Get it off of me . Other side , quick . - The gravity , Leo . - Please help me . Major damage across the country . The polar shift triggered chain reactions . Weve got massive earthquakes along the San Andreas . Los Angeles , San Francisco both badly hit . - Word about the anomaly ? - No immediate reaction . I cant believe it all comes down to Avril Lavigne and Pointdexter . Youd better start believing . Find some religion . I am pleading with you . Hey Lindsey , dont worry . My dad will find a solution . We got a call from the governor . Theres an anomaly headed our way . The gist of it is weve got about 48 hours . Our broadcast is now reaching most of the countries . We have a little official word from the White House on ... the last cataclysmic events . we expect a news conference ... in the next few minutes . We are getting some images ... from that 7,9 earthquake in Southern California . Thousands are feared dead . In London an earthquake ... reaching a magnitude of 5,4 left a wake of destruction . We now go to the BBC for a full report . Okay . Lets do this . These weather changes have brought loss of life and destruction ... to London . Citizens are advised to stay inside ... and await further instruction . The PM will be reporting ... from Downing Street on American plans to stop ... what scientists are calling gravitation . Lets get to work . Lindsey , dont worry . Dads gonna make sure everythings ok . I dont know what happened to my parents. I want to go home . iii get my dads truck . iii take you back . - You gotta talk to Terry . - lll explain it to him . I want to take Lindsey home but he wont let me take the truck . - Why not ? - He says you need it . - l dont need my truck . - l know , but I need it . - Where does he think lm going ? - He says youre going to Houston . - Will you please talk to him ? - Ah , yeah . I imagine youre upset . You overheard us talking . - No . - So what are you doing ? You have to take me to Houston . The Space Agency needs my help . The National Monitor Service . Weve got tide shifting ... typhoons and tropical storms over the Eastern seaboard . - l think this is the end . - Oh , Jesus . If its dark matter , its completely unstable . - This could double in intensity . - Not if the math is right . We dont have the computing power to pull this calculation off . - What are you talking about ? - A strangelet . - Whats that cosmology witchcraft ? - its multidirectional quarks . Its a form of dark matter . It could stop this thing . Strangelets turn every particle into other strangelets . It could cancel this thing out . At least dilute it . - Where can we get one ? - Particle accelerator . - We could somehow transplant it . - We dont even know if they exist . Theres no suitcase for that . If it goes wrong , the planet ... will turn into anti-matter , a big cloud of dust and gas . - Youre thinking inside the box . - Keep thinking . Were out of time . You think this is some game . But people are dying . A tsunami is hitting Manhattan . Now , get to work . - Leo . - Yeah ? - Take her home . Well talk later . - Okay . - Can he have the keys ? Hurry back . - l will . Come on . Whats going on ? Terry wants to go to Houston . To the Space Center . - Why ? - He thinks he has the solution . - You think hes got the solution ? - Maybe. I dont know . Your brother is sweet but he has a mental disorder . - You cant take him seriously . - What if hes right ? He taught Samantha how to read . And he figured out hot to make ... a generator out of car parts . Remember the story about the bus . What if we can prevent disaster if we just listen to him ? Let me bring him in there . Let him explain it to you . - Thank you . - Youre welcome . - Will I ever see you again ? - Of course , I promise . Oh , my God . Lindsey ! What are you doing ? Stop ! Damn it . Lindsey ! Mom . Dad . Oh , my God . - Justin ! - Come on . We have to go . Go ahead . Tell her . I think we got it . - The anomaly is dark matter . - its a collection of quarks . - Quarks are generic particles . - There are 6 different types . Dark matter is formed when strange quarks bond into ... a new form of matter because they dont decay as they should . It creates an unnatural gravity that deconstructs everything . Matter is attracted to the center and time slows down . Its existence is caused by a variety of factors . - Random chance , really . - Thats the only way to stop it . - Creating a dark matter cluster . - This will cancel each other out . Create a wormhole , a bridge between the two . This sounds good . How do we do it ? We need supercharged , accelerated particles . - The ones at CERN in Geneva . - How do we get them into space ? - Wed have to move it somehow . - How much time do we have ? - 1st wave of destruction in Asia . - About 8 hours . Final destruction , 32 hours . We cant even get a shuttle off the ground in that time . We thought youd say that . An option is a nuclear reaction . Launched at the right velocity , the right angle , the detonation ... - could give us what we need . - What type of device ? A thermal nuclear weapon . One thats reliant on fusion . Not fission . Wed have to launch more than 1 . - They can collide . - At the same time . We got it. its multiple devices can be targeted separated . The LGM118A Peacekeeper . It has 10 warheads . If you give us the coordinates we can launch it immediately . - Thats the hang-up . - We need time to calculate ... the sweet spot . Thirty some-odd hours . Lets get started . We have to try . - And thats what we have to do . - l dont know what youre saying . What makes you think the govt hasnt already thought of this ? Cause if they did , they would have already done it . - We have to go to the basement . - Whats going on ? Tornadoes , come on . Come on . Come with Daddy . Here we go , sweetie . Get in the garage , sweetie . Quick as you can . Terry , come on . See this ? Leave it on for two-minute intervals . - How we looking , Trish ? - Thats all of it . - How long ? - According to the counter thing ... - about 32 hours . - What are the alternatives ? Its a complex formula that only your computers ... could decipher. lt would take me years to solve it by hand . I dont know if you have enough paper for me to write on . Right . Okay . Youre here for a reason . Just keep me posted . Leo . Come on . Lets go . Jesus . - We dodged a bullet . - Somebody up there likes us . - You wanted to see me , sir ? - Are TV and radio still working ? - Yes , sir . - l want to address the nation . Yes , sir . The lnterstates out . All the tornadoes and earthquakes . - Many will try to leave town . - To go where ? Well , anywhere . They probably think its local . So rural roads and highways . ltll take longer to get there . It only took us 4 hours to get to Houston for the reunion . Its gonna take more than 6 . Havent seen weapons in a while . Traded it for a wedding gown . Dont forget to take those . Youre gonna save the world , thats bad for your blood pressure . - l love you . - l love you too . See you later . - You watch your back , you hear ? - l will . Good luck , Dad . - lm not gonna wake Sam . - You better . Come on . Lets go . You have 10 minutes . The Secret Service wants to move you ... to a more secure location . No matter how powerless we are we gotta give people some hope . Well leave after we get that message out , all right ? All right , sir . - Give me one minute . - Sure . Margaret . There are many apologies and thank yous that I owe you . I know. lll wait . This is one more of those things that we look back on . A test of our strength that you and me overcome . Dont waste all that talk on me . The world needs to hear it now . - Thats why I took this job . - its easy to forget sometimes . Thank you , Margaret . Lets go get them . - Theyre gonna make it . - l know . Get ready , Mr. President . 10 seconds . And five , and four ... Ladies and gentlemen my fellow Americans ... and anyone who can hear me . This is an international crisis . A global crisis . One that no one expected . It appears impossible to stop . Theres no plan to prevent ... this impending disaster . Weve been caught off guard ... powerless to the whims of nature . My words can only offer inspiration to carry on ... if and when this has passed . To rebuild . To aid each other . To treat every stranger as a member of our own family . This event has shown us that the divisions that separate us ... be they race , religion or status are insignificant . We will all need each other if our species is to survive . Thank you . Good night . And God bless us all . Cut . Very nice , Mr. President . - That thing is causing all this ? - Yeah . This is bad . lm glad you get it because I sure dont . - ls it getting much worse ? - l dont know . Its not good . It breached the 1st safety zone . Well feel the effects in 10 hours . Come on . Where are you going ? Terry , what are you doing ? Electromagnetic impulse created . It destroyed everything electronic . I can fix it . Looks like were walking . - You need to take your pills . - l dont think its time yet . - lt is . - What am I thinking ? Glad to see you are okay . Wheres Ben ? Houston . Randys in charge till he gets back . - Houston ? - Yeah . Long story . Sit down baby . Whats the situation ? A lot of people lost their homes . We dont have radios . Deputies are on foot patrol to see what they can do . - Anyone on the North Side ? - No . We worked our way up south . - Have you seen my parents ? - No , Lindsey. I havent . - its gonna be okay . - We have to find them , Leo . - My brother must be so scared . - lll check out the North Side . - l think you should stay here . - To pass out crackers and waters ? We can help people . At least try to find her family . Emergency situation . Take it . You know how to use it . All right . I was 10 years in law enforcement . Dont go being a cowboy . - All right . - Just have it in your hand . - lll be right back . - l know . Come on . - Whats that line by the river ? - Bridge . - Thanks . - Bridge is out . - What ? - No cars for the last 87 miles . - The bridge is out . - Damn it . - its okay . - l know gravitys screwed up but ... whats your plan ? To carry the truck on our backs and swim ? - its okay . - Stop saying its okay . - Why are you yelling ? - Cause youre frustrating . Youre a genius but you cant communicate . Once there you cant just tell people its okay . People have to understand you . I understand. lf l explain its just a waste of time. its okay . You hear that ? Hold on for a second . Somebodys in trouble . Stay in the car . - lm gonna see if anybodys hurt . - Okay . - Are you all right ? - My car died . Can you jump it ? What are you guys doing ? Sean ? - Hands down . Hes no cop . - What are you doing here ? Baby , the worlds over . Why not party ? Get the hell out of here . This is McGuires house . I dont care . Okay ? Its my house now . Get the hell outta here . All of you get out . - Turn up the heat , huh ? - Forget it , Sean , lets go . I love it. I love it . You forget about it . You forget about it . - This is outta control . Lets go . - Shut up ! All the electronics are out . We can give you a ride to Houston . - But your car works . - l cant explain. its funny . Sorry , man . We aint going to Houston . Dont do this , man .

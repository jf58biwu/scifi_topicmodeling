 Previously , on Touch ... Dr. McCormick . My name is Avram . This is my friend Jake . We believe that your life may be in danger . My mind has begun working too fast . It made sleep impossible . I went weeks without a single night . I felt like I was dying . - But at the sleep center ... - 500 milligrams of adrenaline , now . they 're helping me . Last night I slept . - A sleep clinic . - The insomnia is getting worse . The problem 's reached a whole other level . The clinic gets amazing results . My name is Martin Bohm . I 'm wanted in the state of New York on one count of kidnapping . And you 've come here to turn yourself in ? I came here to clear my name . I told you not to take Jake out of the house . - You did it anyway . - It 's not what you think . Two men came into my house last night and tried to kill me and take my son . Don 't you realize how dangerous this is ? Martin Bohm ! What 's happening ? This is Avram . Please leave a message . Avram , it 's Martin . We 're back at your house . I 'm sorry for yelling . Please , come back so we can talk . Where 's the girl ? No ! Amelia ! Amel- - oh ! Amelia ! Am- - There are few things in the world more frightening than the future stretching out ahead of you , unknowable and unseen . It was a dream , okay ? Just a dream . But sometimes the most frightening future is the one you do know . The fate you see coming and can 't escape . Hey , guys . Everything all right ? Okay . Come on , let 's get up . We got to get breakfast . This is Avram . Please leave a message . Avram , it 's me again . Look , you have every right to be angry with me , but please just call me back as soon as you get this , okay ? Thanks . - Yeah . - Martin , turns out a vendor at the farmer 's market gave a description of a Hasidic man in his 40s being dragged into a van yesterday . He was abducted ? Looks like it . Avram was running down a lead . A man named Dr. McCormick . He thought he was one of the 36 . Trevor , we need to find this vendor . I can be there in 20 minutes . Thank you . Chanting . Hey , buddy . I 'm getting closer . It took going back to Aster Corps ... but I 'm finally making progress on the sequence . We 're getting so close . Maybe ten digits away . When it 's complete , then it 'll all make sense . All the random synapses and pathways will ... will untangle , and I 'll know . I 'll know how to save you . I have to go . I love you . It won 't be long . Since Enron , every reputable accounting firm is skittish . We can 't hide a $ 40 billion loss in one quarter . And this gets out , our stock 'll be worthless by close of bell Thursday . None of that is going to happen , because Calvin here is going to help us avoid all that . Now , thank you for coming . Everything all right ? You have the updates from the sleep clinic ? Yeah , we got another four digits last night , so the sequence is now 97 numbers long . How predictive is it ? Uh , 40 % one day , 70 % the next . We won 't really be able to apply it until it 's completed . And when will that be ? When it wraps back around to the beginning , to 318 . Then we 'll know it 's completed . It should be soon . Well , you need to work faster . You 're auditor shopping , huh ? How bad is it ? My friend was here yesterday . And then he went missing . Do you remember seeing him ? Sorry . I haven 't seen him . Thank you . Martin . I found the vendor . She said it took place in the parking lot around 3 : 00 . She called the police ' cause she got a license plate , but they never showed up . My friend at LAPD ran the van 's plates ... nothing . - How is that possible ? - I don 't know , maybe the witness got the number wrong . This isn 't adding up . Why would Aster Corps take Avram ? I mean , if they knew about him , why didn 't they just follow him back to Jake ? - That 's who they want . - Martin . Oh , no . Hey , buddy , what 's wrong ? Jake , what 's happening ? And we have lovely new jasmine blend . Oh , cardamom . Reminds me of Afghanistan . And a hint of orange blossom . Enjoy . - Jake , what 's happening ? - They 're dying . What do you mean , they 're dying ? Who 's dying ? Avram ? Amelia ? What 's happening ? They 're leading us to something . It 's Dr. McCormick . Amelia , wait there . Dr. McCormick ? Hi , my-my name is Martin Bishop . A friend of mine was looking for you yesterday , and he came to this market . I was wondering ... - I can 't talk . - Just look at the photo . - No , I can 't , really . - It 'll take two seconds . Please . - Doc , please , it 'll just take a second . - No , I really can 't . Please ... Doctor . Oh , my God . Doctor . Doctor . Doctor . Oh , my God . Trevor , call an ambulance . Help ! 2x12 Fight or Flight Resync for WEB-DL by lost0ne Guys , I 'm sorry you had to see that . - Martin Bohm ? - Yes . Detective Lange is on his way to speak to you . Fine . I 'll be here . Well , this day just keeps getting better . I don 't know how this is gonna play out- - I don 't want the kids to be here . - Okay . - Thanks . What do you think ? Popcorn for lunch ? Are you trying to distract us from the fact that we just saw a man die ? That 's exactly what I 'm trying to do . Come on . It 's okay , buddy . You can go , I 'll be fine . Go with Trevor . Martin Bishop . Hello . Dr. Plimpton , what are you doing here ? I 'm meeting a friend for lunch . Is your friend Dr. McCormick ? Yes . Why ? Please come with me . So , what cartoons do you like ? I don 't like cartoons . I like real things . Okay . Not hungry , then ? Five and three . Five and three . 53 . 53 . Does that mean something , Jake ? I don 't know . I came to L.A. as part of a medical study . McCormick was one of the first patients . He took me under his wing , helped me adjust . Look , I know how difficult this is for you , but I need to know what happened to Dr. McCormick . Did he have a history with seizures ? I don 't know . He was always making notes in that little book about his health , but I never asked why . The study you both were part of , wh-what was it for ? It 's a treatment for a rare form of insomnia . My mind is not like other people 's , it ... I see images . Sometimes just flashes , other times whole sequences . People . Things happening . Often in the past . I try , but I can 't shut it off . I don 't even know how to begin to explain this , but ... this is my friend Avram . Have you seen this man before ? Uh ... no . Why ? He was kidnapped here yesterday . He was looking for Dr. McCormick . Oh , my God . How many people are part of your study ? Seven . Well , six , now that McCormick 's gone . - The nest of seven . - Beg your pardon ? Mr. Bohm . Ex-Excuse me for one second . Detective Lange is here to see you now . Okay , just give me one minute . I thought you said your name was Bishop . It 's not . - Look , I had to use an alias to protect my son ... Please . - I think I 've heard enough . Dr. Plimpton . Doctor ! Let 's go . Mr. Bohm , why is it , every time I see you , someone has died ? I know it doesn 't look good . No , it doesn 't look good ; it looks criminal . I didn 't do anything wrong . Mr. Bohm , I am trying to help you , but you 're not helping yourself . Why are you here ? Yesterday a friend of mine was abducted from here . He was trying to find Dr. McCormick , the man who just died . Abducted . - Let me guess , by Aster Corps . - Yes , I think so . You think so . Did you report it to the police ? - No . - Why not , Mr. Bohm ? Because I didn 't think you 'd believe me . That 's the first logical thing you 've said so far . What 's your friend 's name ? Avram Hadar . Here , I have his passport . Mr. Bohm , the best advice I can give you right now is to go home and stay there until I get this whole Aster Corps abduction , whatever else thing all sorted out . - So I can go ? - For now . But I 'll be in touch . Thank you . - You okay ? - Yeah , I 'm okay . Right before Guillermo Ortiz killed himself , he said that he had failed because he couldn 't find the " nest of seven . " I didn 't know what he was talking about , but I think I do . Dr. Plimpton said that she and McCormick were part of some sleep study . There were seven patients , all sharing similar characteristics to Jake and Amelia . Maybe that 's what Amelia was talking about when she said , " They 're dying . " Dr. Plimpton said that McCormick was tracking his health problems in his journal . When I walked up to him , he was writing in his journal . He put it in his pocket right before he died . We need to find that journal now . Come on , guys , let 's go . Come on . We acquired several companies in 2007 . They seemed healthy . A few problem patches but sound . Then we looked closer and discovered that ... there were billions of dollars in hidden debt . So by then it was too late- - The deal was done . I thought if I could just buy a couple more years ... So we , as they say , kicked the can down the road . Now that road has come to an end . All these people , their pensions ... their futures . At 11 : 00 on Thursday ... our company will release its quarterly report , and the world will see a $ 40 billion loss . That 's why you need the sequence . I 've got one play left . Go all in with what money we have . It doesn 't matter what stock we invest in or what currency we short , we just need a sure thing . Why are you telling me this ? We 're the same , you and I. Look ... we both have made a terrible mistake . But we have a chance to make it right . Why haven 't you brought in the boy ? - You said you were close . - I am . They can 't have gone far . I don 't care what you have to do , you get them ! Copy . We have another problem . One of the sleep study patients died . We cannot have the police showing up at the clinic . I know . I 'll handle it . How 'd the meeting with Farington go ? She wants faster results . Bad timing . Why ? What are you talking about ? Dr. McCormick died today . What ? Here at the clinic ? No . He was out . How ? I-I don 't know how . I think he had a history of heart disease in his family . Still , a death in the study- - We-We have to investigate . The procedure is perfectly safe . We put these people into medical coma and we force their brains through hours of exhaustive testing . I 'm not sure " safe " is the word that I would use . You might want to get on board with this . Where 's his chart ? I 'll handle it . I can 't take the kids into the morgue . I 'll be right back . Excuse me . My friend was just brought in here- - Dr. McCormick . I-I was there when he died , and in the panic I forgot to grab something- - his-his journal . It was in his jacket pocket . This is kind of embarrassing , but ... he was seeing another woman , and he wrote about her . He made me promise that if anything ever happened , I would burn it before his wife could see it . Look , I 'll tell you what I told the last guy- - We don 't release personal effects . What do you mean , " the last guy " ? Apparently , that journal must have been pretty hot , because a guy came in here 20 minutes ago asking for it . 20 minutes ago . Hey ! Sir ! You are not allowed in there ! So we know that everything that 's happening is somehow connected to the sleep study . It must be one of Aster Corps ' subsidiaries . There are 8 sleep studies in Los Angeles . This one has only been open for three months . It 's genius . In an evil , insidious way . They don 't have to fake deaths or kidnap anyone . No , the patients just check themselves in and keep coming back- - Unless we shut them down . Yeah , but how ? We need proof . You can 't just walk in through the front door . You 've been a thorn in their side for months . If there 's not a picture of you in every Aster Corps security office by now , they 're criminally inept . Amelia said they 're dying- - We need to do something . Hang on . They know you , but they don 't know me- - I could go in , look for evidence . - No , too dangerous . - No more dangerous than Sarajevo . Come on , it 'll be like old times , you and me . Trevor , I can 't let you go in there alone , and I can 't take the kids anywhere near an Aster Corps facility . What is it , sweetheart ? It 's okay . We stay in the car the whole time , nothing happens to us . Are you sure ? Yes . And me ? I can 't see that far . Martin , I 'm willing to take the chance . We need to do this . Can I help you ? Oh , I certainly hope so . I 'm interested in the insomnia study . We research a very specific group . It 's unlikely that you qualify . Really ? That 's such a shame . My friend Dr. McCormick was so sure you could help . Excuse me . Hi . I 'm Dr. Linus . Oh , Trevor . Trevor Wilbur . I understand you 're having trouble sleeping . It 's plagued me my whole life . Really , I 'm at my wits ' end . Okay , um ... You mentioned you knew Dr. McCormick ? Yes . We , uh , we seemed to share the same symptoms . I try to fall asleep , and then my mind gets full of ... numbers and-and patterns , weird connections . - And I can 't seem to shut it off . - Interesting . Okay , well , why don 't you come with me- - We 'll go this way . Come on in . Why don 't you grab a seat ? We 've developed a test ... to determine if you 're one of the people that we can help . Take your time with it . Press the button on the intercom when you 're finished . Will do . Trevor , what 's wrong ? We got to be quick ; they 've got a camera on me . They gave me sort of test to identify the 36s . I can now say quite definitively I am not one of them . It 's a page of symbols and numbers . Some are circled . Take a picture of it and send it to me . Okay , I got it . Hold on . Jake . Show me what to do . Jake circled three and 48 . Okay , I don 't get the point . It doesn 't matter ; Jake does . Just do it . I asked you for faster results , and you bring me ... What exactly am I looking at ? McCormick 's file is full of holes . There should be patient histories , follow-ups- - There 's none of that . - Did you ask Linus about it ? - Yes . I think he 's hiding something . I mean ... I think he 's hurting these people . Well , he 's getting results . Yeah , but at-at what cost ? At what cost ? Do you have any idea what will happen if Aster Corps fails ? We 're talking about gross medical misconduct here . You kidnapped a child and held her for three years . Yes , and I regret that every single day . But even at my worst , I made sure she was safe . - I took care of her . - Do you have any idea how close we are ? With the sequence , we can create an algorithm that will reveal to us the hidden order of ... the weather , - the stock market , human behavior . - I know . You can tell the future . I know . When you know which strings influence which outcomes , you can grab those strings and manipulate those outcomes . With the sequence , we can control the future . If you 're not comfortable with this , then by all means , you can leave . Just remember that I know everything about you . I 'm the only person standing between you and your kidnapping charges . And if you 're in jail , what will happen to William ? Really , your test results were remarkable . I 'm just glad I qualified . Here you go . One of the nurses will get you settled . Make yourself at home . Uh , wh ... what are you doing in here ? Who-who are these guys ? Ms. Farington is worried about security . Look , these people need to believe this is an actual legitimate sleep study . I can 't have these goons wandering the hallways . I grabbed the doctor 's journal before it fell into the wrong hands . - You should be thanking me . - Good for you . Just try not to scare anyone , okay ? And take that to my office . Sure . Hey . Where 've you been ? Out for a walk . Yeah ? - For an hour ? - I like long walks . Hi , it 's Dr. Linus . " The tremors are worse today . I brought my concerns to Dr. Linus ... " Oh , my God . Oh , there you are . There 's a problem with the machine in seven 's room . I 'll be right there . Dr. Linus wants it handled immediately . - What are you doing in here anyway ? - Just , uh ... just ... looking for a pen . Take these . What is it ? - They help you sleep . - Oh . Hmm . Everyone 's nervous at first . Please sit . And this will track your brain waves while you sleep . Please . You 'll be asleep in no time . Please , I believe there 's been some sort of mistake . " In that day , the Lord will take his terrible , " swift sword and punish Leviathan , " the swiftly moving serpent , the coiling , writhing serpent . He will kill the dragon of the sea . " I 'm afraid I don 't understand the meaning of this . Thank you . Thank you . Mm . Do you see that ? Perfectly normal side effect . Please . Right . Thanks . Think sleepy thoughts . I recalibrated the machine in Ms. Plimpton 's room . Great . Then we 'll start with her . We have a new subject ? We do . A walk-in . Didn 't even have to recruit him . Amazing . Is the new patient ... Is it a boy ? About 11 years old ? No . Why ? Oh . Nothing . Fine . Let 's begin . Amelia , do you ever have trouble sleeping ? Well , I have these dreams , and I wake up and I can 't go back to sleep . But I 'm fine . Jake seems to sleep all right . He 's always out when I check on him . Yeah . If something 's ever wrong with him that I don 't understand you have to tell me , okay ? Okay . Jake has all this information , like , coming at him all the time . H-He sometimes doesn 't know how to turn it off . But he hears you coming down the hall , so he just pretends like he 's asleep . He doesn 't want to make you worry . All I ever do is worry . Trevor , what 's happening ? I have to move fast . It won 't be long before they realize I 'm gone . Okay , look for medical files . Anything that 's gonna help us figure out how they 're hurting the patients . What are you doing out here ? Oh , I 'm looking for the bathroom . You should be out cold . Trevor ? Trevor ... Damn it . I need to get you guys out of here . No , you have to go in there . If you don 't , there 's a 94 % chance someone will die . Okay , I 'm gonna leave the car locked . Don 't let anybody in . If you have to , call the police . I 'm gonna step outside . I 'll call you back . - I should call Dr. Linus . - That won 't be necessary . Hey . There you are . Sorry , seems his dosage was wrong . My screwup . I 'll take care of it . - What 's going on ? - Shh , shh . You 're Calvin Norburg . Yeah , I know . What are you doing ? I 'm creating a feedback loop , so they 'll get a continuous stream of data . If the system doesn 't receive an input for more than three minutes , an alarm sounds . Probably should have factored that into your plan . There 's no plan . I 'm a patient here . - I have insomnia . - Now , look , I 'm trying to help you , okay ? I know you 're working with Martin . Jake is the only one who could 've sailed through the test like that . - Where are they ? - Look , I don 't know what your agenda is here ... If you go wandering around this facility without my help , you will get caught , and they 'll never find your body . You have to trust me , okay ? You have no choice . What are you doing here ? I think he just saved my life . The study is killing the patients . I have evidence . Follow me . I found Dr. McCormick 's journal . Aster Corps sent someone over to the morgue to get this earlier . Same guy who broke into my house . They must have known he was keeping records of his symptoms , logging his complaints . What exactly are they doing to the patients ? It 's similar to my experiments , but much more prolonged and intense . The patients start out fine , but over time , the process shreds the frontal lobe . Trevor , let me see your phone . After a while , the damage is permanent . They can 't recover . What 's your angle ? Why are you telling us this ? Look I know you think I 'm a monster , but I can 't stand by and watch this happen . These people stay here , they 're gonna die . We can 't get them all out before Linus realizes what 's going on . We need to call the police and shut this place down . The police will take too long . There 's a patient- - Dr. Plimpton- - she 's in real trouble . We have to get her out of here now . Oh , she came back . Come on , let 's go . All right , this way . Is she gonna be okay ? Once she gets some rest , her brain should be able to repair itself . Okay , there . They 'll be getting data for the rest of the night . Dr. Plimpton , can you hear me ? - What 's going on ? - It 's okay . It 's okay . We 're gonna get you out of here . I have to get back to the lab . They can 't know that I helped you . If there 's a problem on the way to the hospital , give her this . - It should stabilize her . - How long do we have before they start to realize they 're watching the same data over and over ? Not long . As soon as they know that she 's gone , they 're gonna order a complete lockdown . You have to get out of here now . Good luck . Slowly , slowly . Trevor , come here . Help me get this off of her . Dr. Plimpton , here . Great . Let 's see what 's happening with the new subject . Sure . Dr. Linus , I know I 've had reservations about your methods , but you 've done some amazing things here . Well , thank you . I appreciate that . You are a pioneer . I can 't tell you how much it means ... Wait . Wait . I think there 's some kind of glitch . We 're not getting new data . It 's the same information , over and over , like ... like it 's on a loop . - He 's clear . We can go . - Martin , they know . - What ? - Calvin just texted me . They know . They 're gonna lock this place down . We need to get a passkey . Dr. Plimpton , do you have your key on you ? Dr. Plimpton , please . 53 . What ? 53 . Jake showed me that number earlier . It 's too loud . 53 . 53 . Zero ... five ... three . Nothing . Come on , think . Think . The first three digits of the Amelia sequence . Three ... one ... eight . I got a passkey . No . Damn it ! Give her the shot now . Now ! Hold her still . Come on . She 's stabilizing . Slide on over , sweetheart . - Is she gonna be okay ? - She 's gonna be fine . Martin , you get her to the hospital . I 'll call Detective Lange and send him the evidence . Okay . Thanks . Wipe all the drives . We can 't leave any records . Let 's go , people . The police will be here any minute . Time to go . Quickly now ! What about the patients ? We 'll be long gone before they 're questioned . Out now . What is the meaning of this ? I must apologize for the crudeness of our methods . But I can assure you , it was necessary for your safety ... as well as ours . I was given a mission by one of the 36 . Please ... I must go . I 'm afraid that 's not possible . He will be here by tomorrow morning . Everything will be explained then . Wait . Who will be ? Who is holding me here ? Look , Aster Corps is a Fortune 50 company . Why go to these lengths for some number ? I can 't explain it . This isn 't the first time they 've killed people , and it won 't be the last . Aster Corps takes what they want , no thought to who they hurt . And they always get away with it . Yeah , well , not anymore . Hello ? We just dropped Dr. Plimpton off at West Los Angeles Regional Hospital . She 'll be safe . We 're on our way back home . I 'll call you as soon as we get there . Trevor , thanks for everything . I 'm just glad everyone 's all right . I 'll talk to you later . Bye . There 's nothing more terrifying than the future . And nothing more inevitable . It 's happening . What , sweetheart ? What 's happening ? There are some futures so devastating , you can 't imagine surviving them . No ! No ! No ! So you fight and you run . But no matter how far you run , or how hard you fight , the future catches up . Fate catches up . Resync for WEB-DL by lost0ne

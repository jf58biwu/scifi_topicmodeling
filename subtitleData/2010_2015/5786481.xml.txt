There 's something down there , I tripped over something . Check it out ! Check around , there must be something with that pipe . Incoming ! Get them down , get them down ! Right around where I was . It 's coming , it 's coming fast . Perimeter , people ! Give me a perimeter ! - It 's some kind of tunnel . - Tank , come here . Incoming ! Let 's get down this hole . Hook me up , Big Guy . Down you go . All right . Stay Down ! What the fuck ? At 0300 , I received a Code 455 . This was one of two of the last remaining , non-infected , virus free women on the planet . At 0200 , her life ended . A victim of the OVT virus . This ... is the last non-infected , virus free , fertile woman alive . She is your Package . This female is to be shipped off planet immediately . At 1700 tonight , along with the Package , you will board the Oklahoma . At 1800 you will be cryoslept for a seven month travel . Your 10-TSA destination ... Earth Two . The rumors are true . We have been preparing a planet for inhabitation . Four years ' projected completion . The Oklahoma will land adjacent to a heavily wooded area . You will secure the Package off the ship . Walk the Package 200 feet to a transport . Secure the Package on the transport . Our nation has asked for the best unit . A unit that has never lost a single Package . You are that unit . Let me be crystal , should a situation arise . Her pain , strain , cries or demands are of no significance . Not to me , not to you . This Package gets delivered . Thank you , Tank . Oh , fuck . Ahhhh ! What the fuck is that ? How you wanna play this , chief ? Get down ! Down ! Doc . Doc ! Oh .. Snoop ! Oh , Jesus . Snoop , go get the Doc . Yeah . - Did we stop it ? - Just be still , man . Doc , we need you . Let 's go . I 'm not , I 'm not leaving her . We 're not leaving her . Come on , you come with me . Can you move your legs or your feet ? The knife . - Can you feel that ? - No . Can you feel that ? Feel what ? He 's intact . Back 's not broke . Could wear ... - Snoop ! - I 'm on it ! Snoop , talk to me . I 'm working on it , I don 't see anything yet , I 'm not through . We have to move . Few more seconds . - You got eyes ? - No , not yet . Can we at least move away from this ? Just give me time . Come on man , this is taking too long . I wanna get out of here . I-I wanna go , I wanna leave . We definitely have company in here . Ah , fuck . Okay , the order . Protocol . Tank leads . Then Package . Doc , go . I 'm gonna leave , I 'm gonna get outta here . You bring him Snoop ! - Go ! - Move ! Snoop . I-I 'm looking I don 't ... Give me a minute , I-I 've gotta find it . We don 't have a fucking minute ! Talk to me , come on ... - ... keep talking to me ! - I-I don 't see anything ... Hol-hold on . Hold on , hold on . - Can 't see nothing ? ! - Let me move it around , hold on , hold on ! Can one of you tell me what the hell just happened up there ? I thought this planet was classified blue ? It was blue . It was , I ... Gimme a minute , I-I can see this through my goggles , there 's nothing ... - Well , stick your ear to the hole . - I 'm ... There 's nothing there . Shit . When I say , you 're gonna pull this lever . As soon as it opens , you gotta turn this , and you 're gonna yank the door open . As soon as it opens , you get behind it and stay back ! Jesus Christ . Now ! Snoop ? Snoop ! Tank ! Tank ! Crawl ! We gotta crawl ! We gotta what ? ! We have to , craw ... ! How do you know those things aren 't in there ? Doc ... Rifle . Go , we gotta get outta here . - Ah , ah , ugh . - Come on , come on . - Come on , man . Hold tight . - Ah ! Ah ! Let 's go ! Okay , hold on . Grab the gear , and get us the hell outta here . I 'm gonna get up in this hole , and I 'll pull you up . Hold tight Snipe . Okay ... Rest for minute , but stay to the side and stay down . The door 's closed . Snipe . Hey ! The door 's closed ! Damn . What the ? Snipe ! Snipe ! Oh , you ugly ... Come on . I 've got you , you fu ... Come on ! Come on . I 've got you ya fu ... Oh , Jesus Christ . Come on ! Come on , ya motherfucker ! Come on , come on ! Come on . I got you . Fuck ! Tank ... Doc ... You don 't think it stopped it , do you ? Tank ? Be quiet , okay ? I need to hear this thing because if I can 't hear it , I don 't hear it coming . All right ? Come on . Okay , let 's move . Anybody hear that ? Get to the side . Doc , get your light down there . Lean back . Back ! Doc , come here . Why , why am I going up there ? Shh ! You handle a gun ? No . It 's easy . Point . Shoot . I need you in the front . I lost my glasses . I can 't see anything . Don 't worry about your glasses ... - I need my glasses ... - Just get up here , Doc ! I need you to stay in the front , and keep your gun down the tunnel . - When you will you be back ? - Look at me ! You keep your gun down the tunnel , and you keep quiet . If you see anything , you let me know , okay ? All right , yeah . - Move . - Tank . Shh . Move . - When are you , when are ... - Move Doc ! Package , I need you up here . Come on move ! Move !

I need you up there , get your damn head in the game ! You need to get up front now ! Tank . She 's the only thing that matters now . - Get to the side ! - Let her through . Doc I need you to do everything Tank tells you , to the tee ! Let me know what you see . All right , keep close . Come on . Wait , wait ! Hold up ! What do you see , Tank ? It 's a room . Let 's go . Is it clear ? The tunnel keeps going , but but there 's a room here . It 's clear , come on ! Get back here ! Package , you follow ! Let 's go people , we gotta move ! Can 't see shit . Package , Doc , opposite corners . If we could stay here a while , it 'd be good for her to rest . She 's gonna need ... Five minutes , then we move . I know you 're in charge . I understand that , and agree with that . The human body can regain almost all it needs ... 30 minutes of sleep . Thirty minutes , she 's as good as new . Without it , in about an hour we 're dragging her . Can 't afford to make a mistake on this . What ever the hell this thing is , it 's been ripping through us like paper mache . - Snoop , she does look pretty beat . - I can go . Listen , you got fifteen minutes . - And that 's it ! - Thank you . Let 's just hope you 're thanking me if ... Get in the tunnel ! Tank ... Tank ... What was that ? What was that ? ! Move ! What is your problem ? He 's ... he 's not good in tight spaces . You 're not good in tight spaces ? I 'm not . You get your ass down that tunnel or I 'm leaving you here ! Get the gun and move ! Get up here , get up here . Doc , keep going . Move ! - Maybe we should stop ? - Doc , if you don 't move ... Let 's go . Go . - Stop ! Stop ! - What ? There 's something up here . Get to the side . Shh ! Come on . Do what you can , but we 're not staying long . Calm down , I 'll tell you when I 'm needing the bathroom . Take these , rip ' em . Wrap her hands and her knees . I got a plan . Doc , get that gun . I need you to cover the tunnel . Package , you stay down . Where are you going ? I don 't like this . Ok , alright . Ok , come on . Come on . This plan is not about how we all three are getting up there , is it ? If it moves over those lights , we 're gonna see it . And maybe if I can get one shot into this thing we can kill it . Wait , we 're waiting for this thing ? Not once , not once have we been able to stop this thing . Not once have we gotten a clean shot . Everybody trying to kill this thing is dead . Look , you cover that tunnel , Doc . Now I think we can kill it ! We 're not waiting for this thing to come down here and eat us ! I don 't like this . I 'd rather run . We got thirty feet . If I don 't stop it , if I can 't stop it , we 'll know in plenty of time , and you guys get in that tunnel . How are gonna get up without help ? I can climb anything . I can ! Go ! Go ! You bitch ! - Did you stop it ? - I don 't know , go ! - Go ! - She doesn 't stand a chance with me . Not a chance . You go . Soon we 're gonna run out of water , and it doesn 't matter anyway . All right , all right . You got a full clip , okay ? I don 't know , maybe there 's a weak point . - Okay ? - I 'll be fine . I 'll be fine . Go . Package ! - Move . - Where is he ? Move ! You need to move . Go ! Go ! All right . We gotta keep moving . Come on , come on ! Do you hear that ? What is it ? Okay . - I want you to stay here until I say , okay ? - Okay . If you hear anything , you call me , you got it ? Don 't move until I say . All right . Come on . Fu ... God . Please , please . No . Dead end . God dammit . Come on . Ok , come on ! Come on ! Get up . Get in the corner , come on . Fuck ! You have a choice now . We can stay here ... And fight this thing . I can 't ... I will fight it ... As hard as I can . Or ... I can end this for you now . Before it gets ... Messy ... And painful . Because it will . Or ... I can take you down that tunnel . Maybe to the end , but ... All the air was coming from that pipe . That tunnel 's dead . That 's all I can offer you . A choice . A choice . But it 's yours . Tank ... I don 't wanna die . Fuck . Then let 's get the fuck outta here ! Okay . Drink this . Put this on . Okay , hold that . I 'll go in first , and you stay close behind me , all right ? - When you can 't crawl anymore , I 'll drag you . - Thank you . Let 's move . Come on ! God dammit . - Come on ! - Ok , ok . Move ! Ahh ! Ungh ! Move ! Package , we gotta move ! Dammit . Dammit . Ahh ! Okay . We gotta keep moving . Come on . Package . Ahh ! Don 't stop ! It 's moving faster than us , we gotta go ! Here we go . Here we go . - Ahh ! Tank . - Come on ! Come on ! - Tank ! - Come on ! Move ! Ungh . Ahh . Move ... Come on , keep going ! Come on ! Ungh ! Come on ! Ahh ! Tank , help me ! Please , Tank ! Oh my god ! No ! Look at me . Tank , help me . Motherfucker . All right . Ugh ! God dammit . Ahh ! Ahh ! Ahh ! Ungh ! Ugh ! Ahh ! Dammit . Okay . Ahh ! Ugh ! Ahh ! Ugh ! Ugh ! Hello ? ! Ugh ! I 'm down here . Hello ? ! I 'm in here ! Come on . Come on . Pull it together . Come on , Tank . Come on . You 're coming with me . You 're coming with me ! You 're coming with me . You 're coming with me ! She 's up ! - Is anybody else down there ? - That thing is down there . - Is there anybody else down there ? - No . That thing ... Is the Package safe ? No . That thing is down there . Hey , that thing . We know that thing 's still down there . You probably figured out your bullets won 't kill ' em , but we know what will . Fire . We got a torch crew who 's been coming around and burning them out for us . We 've been looking down these holes , looking for you guys . We 'll contact them , they 'll be here . Fire ? Fire kills it ? Seems to be the only thing that does . Get back . Stand back . How far is the base ? It 's two miles from here . Not even a thank you . What a bitch . Yeah she may be a bitch , but that 's probably one of the toughest chicks you 'll ever meet . What 's her name ? Her name ?

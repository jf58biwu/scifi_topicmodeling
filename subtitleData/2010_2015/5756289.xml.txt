 Aldo Moro e ' morto . L 'ex Primo Ministro , Aldo Moro , e ' stato assassinato . Il corpo e ' stato trovato con dieci proiettili , in via Michelangelo Caetani in Roma . .. posso confermare che Aldo Moro , ex Primo Ministro e leader della Democrazia Cristiana , e ' stato assassinato . Jessica . Who 's that ? Me . Yeah . Who 's that ? A frog . What 's he got on his head ? A crown . Wow . Jessica ? I need to talk to someone . Can you stay with this man ? I asked if you recognised this . It 's a document containing the identity of Mr Rabbit . It was sent to an Italian journalist called Mino Pecorelli . Say hello , Mino . Ciao . Mino 's the man who pinned the death of Aldo Moro on the CIA for us . Mino 's with us . Aren 't you , Mino ? You know I don 't speak English . Getting this was a shock for Mino . It blew his mind , in fact . And we were ... very , very lucky it was sent to him . Weren 't we , Mino ? Look , you know I don 't speak English , why are you asking ? Fuck 's sake ... Do you recognise it , Philip ? Well , you should . You fucking sent it . I 've finished Janus . What ? Does it work ? It works perfectly . It 's perfect . But ... I 've made an adjustment to it . I 've changed it . What adjustment ? Milner ... I 've changed it . What have you done ? What is the adjustment ? You can 't use it . You can never use what I 've made . Give me Janus by the end of the week . Or we 'll torture Jessica . Queues formed outside bakers ' shops throughout England and Wales , with most stores limiting customers to one loaf apiece . The Electricity Council have now drawn up their contingency plans for cuts and disconnections once the strike begins and supplies to power stations ... It has really been quite remarkable , what has been achieved in these last few weeks of the three-day week , er ... by British industry , because of all the arrangements which have been made by the unions and the employers and they ought to have full credit ... What did you do to my Pietre ? Christ , Brosca . Not this again . I 'm his father . Why would I ... I take him to the doctor ! The doctor said it is shock , like trauma . What did you do to him ? Why did you do that ? He doesn 't need a shrink . You need to take your pills . I 'm not taking your pills ! You poison me . What did you do to him ? I fucking kill you ! I really fucking kill you ! Mr Carvel ? And it 's so simple , it 's ... it 's almost elegant . It has the speed , it has the effectiveness , so we introduce the fungus to the gut of the mosquito . We just need a more virulent strain . Ending the mosquito ends malaria . Dengue fever , yellow fever , West Nile virus . We believe we are very close ... It won 't work . I beg your pardon ? M anisopliae ? That 's what you 're talking about ? It won 't work . There 's poor stability in the sporalating strains . You 'll get 35 % effectiveness at best before the mosquito out-evolves it . We believe ... Besides , there are 3,500 species of mosquito . They 've been around for 100 million years . You think you can just yank them out of existence ? I mean , you do realise half the birds in the Arctic tundra will starve to death ? I mean , you have actually thought of that or are you just fucking idiots ? And how would you cure malaria ? Cure malaria ? Why would we want to cure malaria ? Malaria 's doing a great job . Leave malaria alone . Young man , you 're drunk . Yes , I am , and in the morning we 'll both still be cunts . Have you come here just to drink ? There 's a blackout everywhere else . It 's only held once every four years , this . The idea is to get people together who could never normally talk . Like politicians , world leaders scientists . No-one knows it exists . Is that what you are ? A scientist , then ? Must be a good one to get into here . Must be some kind of genius to get into here . No offence . I 'm sure you 're great . But why don 't you just fuck off ? Why don 't you make me ? What 's wrong with curing malaria ? Or don 't you want to make the world a better place ? Let me explain something to you . The sun throws a certain amount of energy onto this planet . We turn it into food , clothing , shelter , et cetera . It supports an amount of us and it took 30,000 years for that amount to become one billion . Then we found a way to use ancient sunlight , sunlight trapped in oil and coal . We started to live off that . What happened ? In just 130 years , our population doubled . The next billion took 30 years . The fourth billion has taken just 14 . So , here 's the question . What do you think is going to happen when that oil and coal runs out in , say , 100 years ? When there 's 10 billion living on a planet that can support only one ? I think we 're going to tear each other to shreds . At last . Someone with an ounce of fucking brain . Malaria ? The only disease that needs curing is us . Go on , then . Let 's throw ourselves off . What are you doing ? Well , if there 's no point in being alive ... All right , OK , I get it . Yeah , yeah , fine . I get what you ... Look , look ! That ... that could tip ! Please don 't do that . Please . Have you ever been in a genocide ? What ? I have . So , if you have some sort of answer ... .. I 'd like to hear it . I have an answer . No-one wants to listen . They 're all too fucking scared . But if you come down off that table , I will tell you . Look , it 's a rabbit . See ? Do you like the rabbit ? Do you like it ? It 's fine , Brosca . He 'll grow out of it . Just a phase . He 's fine . This is incredible . Some of those scientists are Nobel laureates . So ? They think you 're a god . Don 't laugh . Do you see the way they behave around you ? They 're small compared to you . I can 't think like that . Why ? Because it 's true ? I 'm confused by what I feel . Each day is momentous . Each minute , every decision , every action is ... .. historic . And I feel separate . You know ? Do you feel that ? That separation ? See ? You ARE a fucking god . Janus , it 's called Janus , and , um ... it 's a protein and it 's incredible . Er ... the hard part was making it so it can 't be detected . It 's split into two elements , which combine in the brain to create Janus . It then sends signals that alter the production of cohesion in fertility . Essentially , it switches off human reproduction . It 's , um ... amazing . Philip , when you say it switches off human reproduction , we 're not trying to end the human race . We use a placebo . We leave 5 to 8 % unaffected . They 'll remain fertile . And who do we give that placebo to ? There are certain genetic traits that are undeniably advantageous . Now , I believe I 've isolated a group of people who are genetically stronger ... Group ? Do you mean a race ? Race is not a term that science recognises , but , yes , if you must , then " race " . That 's the Third fucking Reich . It 's the opposite of that . I 'm not talking about murder . I 'm talking about allowing some to continue . A world without race . It 's a world without racial fucking genocide ! And can you make Janus decide ? I could . I could find a combination of junk genes that only a certain percentage have , tailor Janus not to trigger when those genes are present . And that would be random ? Nothing would connect those people ? No , it 's junk DNA . Doesn 't do anything . But ... why not choose ? Because that 's not who we are . So , you 've been to Plovdiv ? Yes , I love Plovdiv . Really ? He hasn 't been to fucking Plovdiv . What are you talk ... I love Plovdiv . Plovdiv 's my favourite place . He is a fucking liar , Brosca . OK , you tell me what is the name of the main square in Plovdiv . OK . The main square in Plovdiv , right ? It 's got lots of little ... So , the main square in Plovdiv is called ... Plovdiv Main Square . They 're a straight-speaking people . Shall we do the merengue ? Hand on my shoulder . That 's it . Watch my hips . Shall I spin you around ? She 's lovely , Brosca . Merengue ! Are you OK ? Does he know what you do ? Tom . God , no . I love him . And I want him to continue loving me . No , we can 't . They 're downstairs . I 'm supposed to be getting whisky . You 're driving me nuts . I 'll be quick , I promise . You won 't even notice . Hey ! Philip , I 'm asking you . You have not hurt our son , yes ? Brosca , no . I would never hurt him . I 'm ... I 'm pregnant . I going to have a baby , Philip . Don 't come in tomorrow . There 's going to be a gas leak . They know too much , Philip . Jesus Christ , Milner . Do you think they can walk around talking about this ? They 're good people . Good ? Why ? Because you know them ? We 're saving a species . Are these few more important than everyone because you 've become attached to them ? We can 't afford attachments , Philip . You need to remember that . What have we got here ? Oh . It 's a rabbit . See ? Do you like the rabbit ? Do you ? You see ? Do you like the rabbit ? You like it ? Look how beautiful it is . Look . Try it . She 'll be back in a minute . Just popped out . How are you , Tom ? Yeah . Bit fucked , actually . Do you need anything ? No . No , no . I 'm gonna go to one of those rehab places they have now . Oh , that 's great . Yeah . That 's great , Tom . I really think ... .. you know , this time , you know ? Hm . I heard about the gas leak at the lab . She 's devastated . It means so much to her . Your work . I 've never seen her so alive . Oh ... She loves you , you know ? Not like that . That she saves for me . With you , it 's much higher . Brain love . She loves your brain . Ugh . Oh . Hey . Come here . Hey . Oh , Jesus . Let me get that for you . Did you get the medication ? I did , I did . Philip popped round . OK . Feeling better ? Philip Carvel ? I 'm arresting you on suspicion of cruelty to a child . You do not have to say anything , but anything you do say will be taken down ... She 's right . I experimented on him . I was trying to inhibit violence . I needed a human subject . He was all I had . It changed him . I 've been trying to put it right . I can 't . I 'm sure you had your reasons . Look , I love Brosca . But this ? She 's harming you . Let me help you with her . She has to go . She 's coming between us . What about Tom ? He 's a fucking time bomb . It 's your love for Tom that puts us in danger . I don 't feel like that about Brosca . I don 't feel like that about anyone . The only person I feel like that about ... is you . You and what we are doing together . No . No , Tom , please . Please don 't do that . Don 't . I did ring . I let myself in . We need to talk . OK . OK , talk . Here ? This is quite sensitive . I said talk . The Network lab in Tel Aviv . One of the men worked out the RNA codes for Janus . He has an idea of what it does . Has he told anyone ? Half the lab , as many as 50 people . We 're not sure exactly who yet , but we have it locked down . Do you have a plane ready ? TWA 841 , heading to JFK . We 've told them they 're going to be debriefed by the CIA . Well , you know what we have to do , then . We have to bring it down . We have to plant a bomb on board the plane and we have to kill all of them . What are you talking about ? Killing ? Killing who ? Who you going to kill ? What you talking about planes and killing for ? Mr Carvel ? There have been some complications . I 'm very sorry to tell you , but your wife didn 't survive childbirth . Well , we always knew it wasn 't going to be easy , didn 't we ? We always knew that . There have to be sacrifices . We 're making a new world , Philip . We are creating utopia . OK . You 're special . You 're unique . So , yes , you can have the child . But don 't get lost in her , Philip . Mr Carvel ? Please , don 't get lost in ... You 've had a little girl . A girl ? A little girl ? She 's ... .. she 's beautiful . What are you going to call her ? Jessica . Her name is Jessica . Give me Janus by the end of the week ... .. or we 'll torture Jessica . Take this off . There you are . The continued waste collectors ' strike has led local authorities to store waste in car parks ... .. with threats of a looming oil crisis , talk of a state of emergency ... .. a vote of no confidence in the Labour Government has been called . It 's expected to come down to just one or two votes . It was only two votes . It 's pretty ... pretty tight . Indeed , but , you know , when it 's only two , anything can happen . Coffins ? What a charming place to meet ! Are these full ? Oh ... the grave-diggers ' strike . They 're storing the bodies here . The Winter of Discontent , they 're calling it . Leicester Square 's landfill . It 's Philip . He 's done it again . What ? No . No , I spoke to him . I 've just come from Rome , where we spoke ... You spoke , he listened , and then he did it again . Another document , another leak . We think it 's the same thing . The identity of Mr Rabbit . He sent it to Richard Sykes , UK ambassador to Holland . We don 't think Sykes knows what it means . Why Sykes ? Why send it to him ? If the Tories win the next election , he 's on security with Airey Neave . Airey Neave ? Well , has he seen it ? We don 't know . Look , why is Philip doing this to us ? He 's finished Janus . But he 's scared of it . He can 't bring himself to destroy it so ... he 's doing the next best thing . He 's destroying me . Jesus . What the hell will he do next ? Letan , I have men at the US lab , armed men ... No , no-one touches Philip Carvel . Show me . Your loyalty breaks my heart . Deal with Sykes . Then we need to talk to Airey Neave . At nine o 'clock this morning , Sir Richard was sitting inside his Rolls-Royce in the grounds of his residence here preparing to drive the short distance to the embassy in the centre of the Hague . At that time , two men rushed up on foot and five shots were fired at the car . Sir Richard was hit , and so was his 19-year-old footman , who had just shut the door . Milner ! It 's an honour to meet you , Mr Neave . Mr Neave , we believe you may have received some information from Mr Sykes before he died . A document ? I did ! Extraordinarily extravagant stuff . International conspiracies at the heart of many governments et cetera , et cetera . It 's terribly exciting reading . Well , as strange as it may seem , we 're worried that this information may be putting your life at risk . Really ? How dreadful . And do you know who killed poor Richard yet ? Not officially , but we believe it was dissident republicans . Do we ? Are you talking about " we " as in MI5 ? Well , yes , I 'm sure that " we " does believe it was the IRA . Or the INLA . Or the RSPCA , for that matter . But you and I , Milner ... .. we know it was someone else . And who do we ... think it was ? Why , it was you , Milner . Are you suggesting the British security services assassinated Mr ... Oh ! Are we playing that game ? If we did ... kill Sykes ... .. what makes you think we won 't just kill you ? I 'm not Sykes , Milner . Or Letan . Or Rabbity . Or whatever your name is . Now , as you know , there 's a vote of no confidence in Mr Callaghan and his government . This Friday , in fact . If we win this vote , there 'll be a general election and Margaret will become Prime Minister . Hooray . But it 's balanced on a knife edge . Alfred Broughton , Labour MP . He 's at death 's door , apparently . And you want us to push him through that door ? Heavens , no ! If you did that , the vote might get delayed . No , I just want you to get him to pull a sickie . Mr Carvel ? Who are you ? Your friend Milner sent me . She 's rather upset with you . What do you want ? Pleased to meet you . My name is Mr Omida . Er ... should the time come , I am to be your daughter 's torturer . I 've been asked to explain my process to you . Now , Jessica 's only four , and always the difficulty with such an age is maintaining life for the maximum amount of time . So I will need to monitor vital signs throughout . But , er ... this is just a matter of being attentive . Moo ! Mmm ! Dr Isherwood ? What we 're about to tell you is a matter of national security . There is a threat against one of your patients . An MP . Alfred Broughton . He will be assassinated on his way to Westminster this Friday ... .. and we need you to stop him . Me ? Tell him he 's too sick to travel . What ? That won 't stop him . Christ , have you met him ? Then make him too sick to travel . We can 't go to Broughton himself or we risk alerting those around him who are setting this up . But , er ... what about the vote ? I mean , it 's a vote of no confidence . Have you any idea how much that matters ? Bernard Weatherill . He 's a Tory MP . There 's a gentlemen 's agreement that if a member of the Government is too ill to vote , then an opposition MP also won 't vote . We have persuaded Bernard to honour that agreement . Bollocks ! Who do you think I am ? Dr Isherwood , this is ... You 're trying to topple the fucking government ! No , no . I 'm a Labour voter . I 'm a card-carrying member , you fucks ! I 've been on picket lines up and down this country , and I know an MI5 stitch-up when I see one . Martin ! Please don 't do that . Martin ! Fucking establishment crypto-fascist bastards . You 're all the same . Terrified of the proletariat . Martin , call the police . That 's not a good idea . Tell them it 's a matter of national security . Martin , no . They 're trying to ... There . Now can we all just please calm down ? Make sure Alfred Broughton doesn 't vote . Will you do that for us ? Mr Carvel ? Philip ? I am Omida . I need to know ... I need to know I can get through to you . Please nod . Good . Torture is communication . So , what I will do is , I will inflict a torture upon your person . Then I 'll go and inflict the same torture upon Jessica . It will be exactly the same , not diminished . What you feel , she will feel . Exactly . You will imagine her screams . Her tears ... Please . Her begging . Please don 't do that . I will go back and forth this way for a period of several hours and if that doesn 't work , then we 'll start all over again but with her in front of you . Now , propriety requires me to ask you if you 'd simply like to give us Janus now . It 's ... perfect . But I 've made a ... an adjustment to it . I 've not been in control of myself , you know ? Well , we can work that out . I promise . It ... it 's not ... Tell us , Philip , please . Always , with my first torture , I like to start with something brutal and traditional . I 'm simply going to pull out the fingernails on your right hand . Aaah ! Is it here ? Is it in the lab ? Is this it ? Is there something in this ? I 'm ashamed of what I 've done ... .. and I 'm scared of you . You will use it no matter what . Please don 't hurt my little girl . Oh , please ! I 'm going to visit Jessica now , Mr Carvel . Don 't ! Not Jessica ! Did you call that in ? Who the hell called that in ? Move , move , move ! Evacuate all areas ... We need to evacuate this area now . Yes , I know , but I need to get back there . Ma 'am , I will not tell you again ! There is a nuclear incident at the Three Mile Island plant . We must evacuate this facility . .. Please go to your designated assembly rooms ... Philip Carvel ? My name is Christos . I 've come to get you out of here . 'Harrisburg , Pennsylvania . An accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant . ' Federal agents said the reactor 's core may have been damaged . Radiation passed through the four-foot concrete walls and was detected a mile away from the plant . 'Mr Callaghan lost the vote of no confidence by a single vote 'and has called a general election for May 3rd . 'Favourite to become Europe 's first woman Prime Minister , 'Margaret Hilda Thatcher . ' 'The bomb went off shortly before three o 'clock . 'The bomb , in fact , had been placed in Mr Neave 's blue Vauxhall car . 'Clearly , this was a deliberate and well-planned operation . 'But by whom ? When Mrs Thatcher was given the news by an aide , 'nobody knew that the victim was one of her closest friends . ' There 's someone been killed in a bomb outside the House of Commons . Just now , seven minutes ago . Who ? We don 't know yet . Terrible news , Mrs Thatcher . We 've lost him . Don 't you mean we 've lost it ? Isn 't it Janus we 've lost ? I 've just heard that Airey Neave has been killed . An IRA bomb , they 're saying . Hm . It was you . But ... I don 't understand . If ... if we could do this all along , why the hell did we do what he said ? We need a government that stays in power . I think this lot will be around for a while ... .. with help . We 've managed to pull some footage of Carvel with Jessica from the close-circuit system . We think that 's the vaccine ... .. and we think Janus is inside it . It 's in her ? He put it in Jessica ? And what 's his name ? His name 's Dane . Mark Dane . And does he have family ? No . No , he hasn 't got any family . OK , Jessica Hyde , let 's teach you how to use a gun .

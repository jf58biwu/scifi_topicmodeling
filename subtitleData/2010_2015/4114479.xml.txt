Peter ! Peter ! Peter ! Oh , God ! Peter ! Oh , God ! No ! Peter , no , please ! No ! Peter , please ! Oh , God , please . No ! Please don 't . Oh , please ... Oh , no ! Oh , no ! Aah ! Get off of me ! You 're not my mother ! Oh , God ! I want to go home ! Stop ! You 're not my mother ! I want to go home ! ♪ Fringe 3x15 ♪ Subject 13 Original Air Date on February 25 , 2011 Okay , children , let 's begin . That 's it . Now , close your eyes . I want you to ignore everything except the sound of my voice . Try to relax . Clear your minds . We discussed that your imagination can take you anywhere you want to go . What 's wrong ? I don 't know what snuggles will do ... If we go somewhere . Just ... put him on your feet and he 'll come with us , Nick . Olivia , how can you concentrate if you 're talking ? Now , close your eyes , dear . Now , concentrate . Imagine this world ... slipping away . Excuse me , Dr. Bishop . Your wife is on the phone . Tell her I 'll call her back later . Well , she said to tell you that she 's here ... in Jacksonville . Is it Thursday , Miss Ashley ? Isn 't Thursday early day this week ? Ha ha ha ho ! Well , I 'm gonna go home , and you can too ! Yay ! Okay , guys . Get your backpacks , okay ? Ben , yours is in the corner there , and , Jen , don 't forget your violin on purpose again , okay ? Where is he ? Of course the Dodgers play for Los Angeles . No , they don 't . They play in Brooklyn , and I 've seen them . And the Red Lantern isn 't supposed to be green . I 've never had a baseball mitt before--never . Peter , you were very sick for a very long time . It must have confused you , mixed up your memories , son . Do not call me that . Hey , hey- - I am not your son ! You are not my father ! And she is not my mother ! You are not my father ! Hey , hey ... Get off of me ! Hey , hey , hey ... You 're not my mother ! I want to go home ! He 's asleep . We can 't keep this up . It 's making him crazy . What 's the alternative ? Tell him the truth ? He 'd be locked up . These lies were supposed to be a temporary measure . We were supposed to have him home well before it got this far . It 's been six months , Walter . Getting him back wasn 't as simple as I 'd hoped . You 're working , but I 'm with him . Elizabeth , I think this series- - I 'm with him all the time . I can 't watch him suffer like this . What if ... If you made a device like the one you used to bring him over ? Elizabeth , we have been through this . That would be catastrophic . The texture of the universe has changed from my crossing . It cannot withstand any more damage . Neither can he , Walter . He is in such distress . He--he looks at me , and he doesn 't trust me . I 'm his mother , but no matter what I say , he- - Elizabeth , Elizabeth , you are not his mother . He 's a little boy very much like our son ... And we saved his life . No , you--you- - you saved his life . I 'm just trying to keep him alive . I won 't keep lying to him like this . Elizabeth ... It 's not fantasy . I can 't keep him safe if he doesn 't trust me . Please ... Just a little more time . I told you ... I think the children are the key . The children should be able to cross over , and when they do , they can take Peter safely home with them . He--he can ride on their feet . Just give me a little more time , please . Damn it , Olivia . When I say go to bed , I mean go to bed ! Don 't you run from me ! Come here ! Get your butt back in- - ... Ever run from me ! Hey , I 'm really glad you got some sleep . Peter . Do you really think I don 't know that you 're not my mother ? Please , can we just , uh- - You think I can 't tell ? Peter , how many more questions am I gonna have to get right before you believe me ? We 've been doing this routine for two months now . I told you the name of your hamster . I told you- - you got some wrong . Yes . And maybe that 's because you 're confused because you were so ill . He makes you say that , doesn 't he ? 'Cause he 's the one who stole me . Stole you from where , Peter ? From the other world at the bottom of the lake . Love ... I know that I sound crazy . But I 'm not , okay ? I 'm not crazy . So let 's just , um- - let 's just get out of the house today , baby , okay ? Let 's just , um , get some air . You look gray , which is not technically a skin color . Another sleepless night ? Yes , I suppose so . Look , I 'm not finished with these . I want to organize a subgroup data . So if you don 't mind- - There 's no need . I have something else in mind . This is not working . I want to separate the children and begin independent testing . Okay , well , any particular order ? What 's Olivia doing inside ? Well , she didn 't have a very good night either . Olivia , why don 't you go outside and play with the others ? Olive , what happened to your eye ? Ashley said that you told her that you fell . Running in my house . Olive , you can trust me . If someone is hurting you- - I said I fell , okay ? I fell . That 's all . May I ? Olive , why did you draw this ? Did you see it in a book ? Where , then ? Was it last night ... when you fell ? You know tulips don 't usually grow in areas like this . Well , then what are they doing here ? A Professor who was working here missed them , so he imagined a tulip that would grow in this climate , and he invented it . He used his brain and his imagination to turn the world into what he wanted it to be . How would you change the world if you could , Peter ? What would you wish for ? I wouldn 't make stupid flowers grow . What would you do ? I 'd go home . A couple of more errands , and ... then I 've got a surprise in store for you . Peter . Now , listen , can I trust you not to run off on me ? Okay . Go and pick a toy , then . Go on . Ooh , that 's a strange game . What 's that called ? It 's called Joust . I suspect her crossing over was triggered by an extreme emotional response . Her black eye . So , now we need to design a series of experiments around emotional flexibility . Hey . I wanted to show Peter where you worked . Hey , Peter ! Hey . Look at that airplane . That 's , um ... A DC-3 , yeah ? Aha . The beguiling Olivia Dunham beguiles . Listen , Peter , I was about to go and get a snack . Would you like to , uh , come with me and get something ? Yeah , go on , Peter . Okay . Come on , let 's go . We 've had a promising development . I think young Olivia may have crossed over . And if I 'm right and she has ... Then she can take Peter home . I knew you 'd find a way . Well , I-I still have to work out precisely how she does it . But we 're nearly there . William , I need your help . I have reason to believe subject 13 , Olivia Dunham , has been able to cross over to the other side . But I believe that young Olivia may need to be in some kind of heightened emotional state to access her ability . I 'm compiling some recordings on my new Betamax . Perhaps you 'll be able to see something I cannot . Okay , Olivia . You feeling comfortable ? I 'm fine . These wires will show me how you respond to the tests . I 'll just- - Ashley . Uh , test series Alpha . I 'll be monitoring vitals , theta rhythms , stable neocortex . Okay . Well , you 're doing very well there , Olive . Now , these four brothers grew up to be great warriors . They were very special because they had the power of metamorphosis . Metamorphosis ? Mm-hmm . Ah ... He could turn into ... A hawk , watching for invaders from on high . The speed of a cheetah and ... the fire of a dragon ! Minimal response to joy . Theta rhythms show a slight bump but not within our range . Can I stop now ? Not yet , dear . You need to keep going . A little longer , Olivia . You 're doing really well . You 're doing great , Olivia . Heart rate 140 beats per minute for 30 minutes . No response to exhilaration . You 'll have to start over . - It doesn 't fit . - Try it . Look at each piece carefully . No . You 'll have to start again . I-it doesn 't fit , Dr. Walter- - Try it . Faster . Come on , come on . That 's wrong . That 's wrong . That 's wrong . Concentrate , Olivia ! No ! I 'm not working on this anymore ! Minimal activity in the stable neocortex . Anger isn 't the answer . Loneliness isn 't the answer either . Perhaps fear ... Show you a movie . It 's one of my favorites . It 's called Jaws . It 's ... It 's a bit scary , but I think you can handle it . Um ... sorry . That 's all right . Ready to start the movie ? No , no , no . Um ... No , let 's- - let 's take a little break . Let 's get that off you . You don 't need that . It started to occur to me , William , that fear by itself wasn 't the answer . Walter ? Let me out ! Please , let me out ! Who 's there ? Is someone there ? Aah ! Approaching the building , requesting clearance to dock . Love , come and get your coat , will you ? I don 't think Olive thought the joke was very funny . No , I suppose not . There you go . Nick , would you please wait outside with the other children ? Thank you . Dr. Bishop- - just a minute , Ashley . We 're obviously on the right track . The part of Olivia 's brain that let her do this must be the same part that lets her cross between universes . But I 'm still missing something . Dr. Bishop , we have another problem . Let 's get your backpack on , okay ? Good night . Ashley ... what 's going on ? There 's been a small fire , but everything 's under control . Ashley . One of the children has gone missing- - a girl , Olivia Dunham . Now , your husband and the others are out looking for her , and I 'm sure that everything 's gonna be fine . Okay . All right . Thank you . Peter , come on . Come inside with me . Peter , will you wait here for me for a minute ? Okay . Good boy . I 'll be back in a second . Elizabeth . Did you find her ? No , we haven 't yet . This little girl , Olivia- - Walter , it says that you think her stepfather 's hitting her . I- - " William , I believe the ideal environment " for transition across universes " may be a return to her home . " The unique combination of love and terror there apparently stimulates a cortical reaction . " " A " - -they are notes . And " B " - -yes . The unique combination of love and terror does stimulate a cortical reaction that may be the key to her crossing over . And if she is not allowed to return to her home to restimulate the pathways- - What , you mean to be terrorized again ? Then it could well take me years to simulate the state artificially . Walter , you said that this was just a theory . Surely there 's got to be some other way . And if there isn 't ? This is not about you and me and Peter anymore . Don 't you see what I 've done ? I crept over in the night ... and I stole their child . If we don 't return him , they 'll figure it out , and they 'll come after him , after us- - I know- - because that 's what I would do . So you would sacrifice one for the other ... This little girl Olivia for Peter ? No . But for thousands of others ... or millions , it would have to be considered . Walter ... Oh , I 'm sorry . I was looking for Peter . He told me he 's never had peanut MMs before . Oh , he 's out by the cubbies . No , I just looked there . Peter ? Peter ? It 's been six months since Peter Bishop disappeared , but authorities still have no ideas . The sympathy of the world goes out to Dr. Walter Bishop and his devoted wife , as the entire nation remains aghast at the kidnapping of their only son . Dr. Bishop , the architect of the famed Star Wars Defense System that protects our nation , and his wife made an emot- - This isn 't doing you any good . Don 't turn it off now . They 're about to point out how ironic it is ... that the safety czar couldn 't protect his own child . Walter , I 'm serious . You can 't keep doing this . You can 't keep drinking yourself into oblivion . Do you have a better suggestion about what I should be doing ? Well , not this . Should I give up on my son ... The way the police seem to have ? Dinner 's ready in 20 . I 'm not hungry . That 's fine . You still need to eat . If nothing else , you need to put something in your stomach to absorb all that alcohol . You said he was wearing a beige sweater . The man who took my son- - you said he was wearing a beige sweater , not a suit like I would wear . - Walter , please don 't do this . - How did he sound ? His voice ? I have a new theory- - plastic surgery . There are a handful of surgeons skilled enough to pull off a feat of this magnitude , but the voice ... The voice would be tricky . You know what ? Maybe it was plastic surgery ... Or an alien able to take on any shape he wanted . We 've considered all your theories , Walter , and none of them have brought our son back . It happened . It just happened , and it 's inexplicable . Nothing is inexplicable , Elizabeth . Science is seen as magic by primitives . Something happened in this house , and we have to go over it and over it until we find out what we 're missing . And how will this time be any different ? I don 't know yet . We have to go over it . I have , Walter . I 've thought back . I 've gone over it again and again . I have told you and a dozen policemen every detail that I can remember about that night . I 've had hypnotherapy to try and recover every detail I couldn 't ! I know . And I believe you ... About all of it . But there has to be something we 've overlooked . There has to be an explanation . You fly to Florida every Monday . You work all week , and then you come back , and we do this . This is not a marriage anymore . It 's a routine . Please , Elizabeth ... one more time . He 's my boy . I can 't lose him . I 'm so sorry , my love . I know I can 't keep doing this . But it 's impossible . Impossible he 's gone . I know . I know , Walter . I spend every waking moment imagining where he is ... what he 's doing . And I pray that wherever he is , he 's safe ... That someone 's taking good care of him ... and that someday , by some miracle , we 'll get to see him again . But until that miracle happens , I can 't break . I need to be here for him . We need to be here for him . But we won 't . Walter , we 're breaking . Our marriage- - this is breaking us . And I can 't let that happen . I need you , my love . I 've lost Peter . I- - I can 't bear to lose you too . Don 't go to work tomorrow . Stay home this week . Forget the lab . Forget Florida . Let 's put our marriage back together . Welcome back , sir . Morning , Dr. Bishop . Morning . Dr. Bishop , it 's almost dark , and there 's still no sign of either of them . I found this . It 's Olivia 's . Hi . Hi . How 'd you find me ? I guess tulips don 't normally grow around here . But ... How 'd you know I 'd come here ? Because it 's the only drawing that looked happy . My name 's Peter . Mine 's Olivia . Don 't- - be careful . I 'm not scared . What happened ? My step-dad did it . So ... Everyone 's looking for you . I messed up ... And now he 's gonna send me home . Who ? Dr. Walter . Did you tell him ... Walter , I mean , about your step-dad hitting you ? I don 't think it 'd do anything . My mo- - my mom was telling me you got to imagine how you want things to be . And then you can try and change them . Do you trust him ... Walter ? You should tell him . You got to try something , right ? I think I cooled off by now . Did you imagine that ? No , the last time we saw her was before 5 : 00 . We went looking ourselves , but then it got dark . And do your son and the girl know each other ? No . He--he 's not from here . He doesn 't even know the area . Look ! They 're back . Oh , Peter ! Oh , God ! We were worried sick about you . Are you all right ? Huh ? Yeah ? Let 's just have her go inside . I don 't know what she 's going through . I just want to check her . Please . Okay . Okay , thank you . Come on , sweetie . Come on . Okay , your step-father 's on his way . Olivia , sweetie , we were all so worried about you . What were you thinking ? I want to see Dr. Walter . Okay , you can see him tomorrow , but- - No ! I have to see him now . Olivia , you can 't see him now , okay ? Olivia , don 't- - My step-father did this . He hits me . That 's when I crossed over to the other universe . Look ... That 's where I saw the blimps , just like you said . They were in the sky in the other universe . Can you make him stop hitting me ... Please ? Olive ? Olivia ... What is it ? What 's wrong ? I 'm sorry , Dr. Bishop . I hope our little princess hasn 't caused you too much trouble . No trouble at all . Come on , Olivia . I 've been worried sick . Let 's get you home . Before you go ... I want you to understand that this girl is very special to me , and if anything harmful should happen to her , anything to frighten her or make her uncomfortable in the least ... I will not hesitate to inform Social Services ... in which case , I have certain government friends who could ensure that you will be facing significant troubles for yourself . Do you understand me ? Dear ... you go home and get some rest , huh ? And ... we 'll see if we can figure out a new way tomorrow . All right ? I 'm sorry . Hmm ? When I ran off- - I-I 'm sorry if I scared you . Peter , it 's ... I 'm never going back ... Am I ? Listen to me . Sometimes the world we have is not the world we want . But we have our hearts and our imaginations to make the best of it . I will promise you this . I will be the best mother I possibly can be to you . I 'll take care of you . I 'll protect you . And I 'll never let anyone take you away from me ... No one ... Not ever . But you 're not her ... are you ? You 're not my real mother . You were sick . You were very sick for a long , long time . And I think it confused you . Yes ... I am your mother . Of course I am . Now ... you go off and wash your hands for dinner , okay ? Okay ... Mom . Hello ? Elizabeth , it 's me . I know where our son is . I know where Peter was taken .

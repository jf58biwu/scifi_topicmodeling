Come on ! Come on , you guys ! So , Mike , what I 'm trying to say is that this semester - The demon stone ... How we gonna get in there ? We 're gonna take it . We 're just gonna grab it . It 's all around 12 thousand pounds . But how we gonna move it if it 's that heavy ? How we gonna move it ? So , what ? Now you 're telling me you 're afraid of demons ? Uh no , what I 'm trying to tell you is that we don 't have time to be chasing rainbows this semester , Mike . Why not ? ! That 's what we do ! Come on , we 're thrillseekers ! That 's what life is all about ! Yeah look , I would rather go chasing rainbows ... than just sit around waiting to say " bingo " and keel over . Now look , the three of us , we have hit up caves in the Congo . Come on , we 've surfed in Acapulco ! We have climbed and skydived damn near every spot from here to Tahoe . And now you 're telling me you 're afraid of some legend . Focus on your thesis , Michael . Not another crazy scheme ! It 's not crazy . Lemme get this straight then . You wanna go into this underground storage facility and go through these old tunnels just to find some stolen grave statues ? - Ah no , no ... Priceless stolen grave statues . You probably don 't even know they 're down there ! Yes , I do ! Look , I am in with the guy who works there ! He doesn 't know what he has . Mike , if this was so easy , how come you haven 't gone down there yourself already ? I would 've ... But I need your help . Look you guys , this time I promise . I promise there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow . Mike , if you were a midget in a green costume .. And had four-leaf clovers spewing out of your ass ... I still wouldn 't believe that shit ! And it sounds dangerous , anyway ! It 's not dangerous ! How do you know ? ! Okay ... " The Demon Stones of the Ontume , major archaeological treasure , were stolen from the Museum of Science and Industry . Anonymous tip led police to a warehouse where they discovered mutilated bodies ... of numerous suspects , but the artifacts were never recovered . " Okay ... Okay ! There 's more ... " Hieroglyphics have linked the ancient tribe to partake in ... human sacrifice and demon worship . Legend states the stones whistle when covered with blood . This however , has never been proven . " Okay , okay , so ... It 's creepy ... But it 's not dangerous . Okay Mike ... So we just go down there and we see if these things whistle . That 's it , right ? Yes , yes ! And I know that deep down inside ... you wanna know , too ! Michael , what is this ? Is this a joke ? ! You know I don 't like messing around with voodoo , and crap like this ! Kendra , you 're really that scared ? No , I just don 't want to end up on the front page of the newspaper ! Not going to ! Look , all I need you to do is navigate me and Floyd through the tunnels and help us pull it out ! Then we go to the museum ... Cash in ... And Kendra ... I know your parents could use the money . Hey , come on , man , look ... Kendra , you don 't have to do this if you don 't want to , okay ? Whatever ... You guys both know my dad lost his job . And my mom 's stressed about losing the house . This could help . So we 're all in ? Looks like it . All right , it 's settled . Feels good , don 't it ? Look , we 're closing up . I 'm not gonna go upstairs to cut a lock . Oh really ? ! Like an extra 10 minutes is really gonna kill you ? ! Honesty ? ! - Sorry ladies , but - Listen , listen , we really need to get the stuff out of the locker . Well then , where 's your key ? I told you , it 's lost ! Look , we 're gonna be super quick ! Look , I 've been here all day today , all right ? Come back tomorrow . Come back tomorrow ! Oh , such a hard day ! Fucking idiot . What are you doing ? Let 's go . Hey , are you feeling okay ? What ? ! - I don 't know , did you take your pills today ? What ? ! Yeah , I took my pills !

He didn 't say that . - He didn 't , no . Come on ! See we 're going for a world record here ... Can always make more than one trip , bro . So uh ... We 're gonna catch the game later , right ? Dude ... What 're you doing ? Sorry , I was just looking at - - Greg ! I just wanna get this stuff stored away . Can we focus on that ? Yeah , that 's why I 'm helping . - Good ! So let 's finish this , okay ? Okay . I mean , look at all this clothes everywhere , it 's like people just throw stuff away wherever ! You know , I should just ... You know , I think I should pick it up and take it to a homeless shelter . Dana , will you hurry up ? ! I don 't have all day for this ! I know but people , they don 't care about stuff , so I just - Yes they do ! But they only care about themselves ! You know , that guy is gonna be pissed ! Who ? The attendant . Screw him , he was an absolute asshole anyway . What was that ? People ... Jackass ! You know what ? I hope you take a chill pill when you leave , ' cause you know how you are . Whatever ! So Mike , how much you think you 're gonna get for whatever stuff 's in the trunk ? Let 's just say you might wanna start uh , thinking about early retirement . Oh , I 'm gonna like this ! So , how old is this place ? Oh , it 's been around since the 1920 's . How far does this thing go down ? Nine stories deep underground , my friend . This guy 's just about freaking out everyone . I don 't know ... Are there stairs ? Stairs ? Who needs stairs ? What do you do if this thing breaks down ? Oh , Betsy here , she 's never broken down . Not once ... Welcome to Alcatraz . Okay , just one more trip . Dude , this place is about to close ! He won 't mind if we grab a few more things . Can I say something without you flying off the hinge , bro ? Why are you making it seem like I 'm so unstable ? Because you are . I 'm serious , T ! Okay , what ? ! At some point , you have to move on , bro . Greg , I really think we shouldn 't talk about this right now . It 's been almost two years . Dude , let 's go ! You couldn 't control what happened ! Do you know how you sound right now ? ! Okay , I 'm sorry for being a hump ! I 'm not saying that . - Then what are you saying ? ! Todd , we 're like brothers , man . I just don 't want you to wander around like you 're about to jump off a fucking cliff ! I 'm emotional , okay ? ! People don 't just die and you turn the page , like some robot ! If you ever cared about anybody in your life , you 'd relate to that . Daddy loves you , too , baby girl . Of course I miss you . Oh baby , why you crying ? No , wipe those tears away . Daddy 's gonna get a new job ... And then we 're gonna be able to get a house . And then we 'll all be together ! Of course Shaggy can come ! Amanda ? Hello ? ! Amanda ? Hello - Hi ! Yeah sweetie .

'Cause I don 't wanna lock you in here on accident . They couldn 't pick a different name for this place besides Alcatraz ? Sweetheart , this place is a prison . It 's underground , concrete walls , and steel doors . Once it automatically shuts down , nobody , and I mean nobody , get in or out . Well that 's just great ! Come on . Let 's do this ! Rachel , I think we should come back tomorrow , okay ? No , I just wanna get this done and get it done today ! I know , but what if he - Rachel ? Rachel ! Rachel ! What ? ! Fuck !

What ? I just saw something . You what ? I just saw something move . Where ? Down there . The lights ? And your eyes . They can play tricks on you . Make things appear to be moving . I 'm sorry . Come on , let 's go ! You were right man , this was cake . I tell you , baby . It 's all good ! Mike , let 's open this bad boy up , man . Where 's the blood ? I know you brought some . Can we please not do that ? Come on , Chicken Little ... Why don 't you wait for the sky to fall first ? Why am I always the only voice of reason ? Mike , where are the cutters , man ? Thought you were supposed to bring ' em . No , I specifically said for you to bring them ! It doesn 't matter , because we can open it outside ! Thank God ! Let 's go ! All right , whatever .

Am I gonna leave it in my closet over the weekend ? - Sure ! Look Kendra , Alcatraz is the safest place . It 's the smartest choice . No , you never said anything about this ! I don 't fucking care because it 's my plan , okay ? ! - We 're all here together now ! - Guys , calm down ! Calm down , man . Whatever , we 'll figure this out later . Fine . Need some fresh air anyway . Get this outta here . These lights are really starting to freak me out . Still don 't get why we 're leaving this shit here , man . It 's your call .

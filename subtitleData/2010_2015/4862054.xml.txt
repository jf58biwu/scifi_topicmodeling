 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... We haven 't met . I 'm Mrs. Frederic . Warehouse 13 ... Is it yours ? It 's mine ... And so are Lattimer and Bering . Excuse me ? Kate Logan , Chicago Field Office . I didn 't know you transferred to Chicago . So , uh , you showing up here means I should call you , right ? Call , don 't call- - same as always . Hey ... I 'm so sorry we got cut off earlier . S-something huge came up . I don 't think it 's a good idea for me to see you anymore . Turn around and put your hands in the air ! H.G. Wells . That 's my daughter ... My Christina . Everything that ever mattered in my life is gone now , except the Warehouse . I want to come back and work there again . Okay , I don 't care if I 'm having a brain transplant . If you cross paths with H.G. Wells , yank me out of anesthesia , and you fill me in . Is that understood ? Yes , sir . Crystal clear . Aggh ! Agh ! Aah ! Stop ! For God 's sak- - agh ! I told you I 've got a bad shoulder , okay ? It 's an old wrestling injury . 71 . He bowled a 71 . It 's amazing to me that you 're single . Really , so surprising . It broke . What ? What ? What broke ? She knows . Just some dumb shelf . Is there a reason Warehouse shelves are falling down ? Yes . We need brackets . This one 's got me stumped . Yeah , me too . Todd works at the hardware store . Oh ! Yes , yes . Todd , the young lad with the the glasses- - the boyfriend . Not anymore . They broke up . She 's trying not to run into him , so she won 't go to the hardware store to get the brackets- - I don 't care about Todd . She doesn 't care about Todd . What a coincidence . And we 've got work to do . Yes , let 's all grow up a little , shall we ? ♪ " C " is for cookie ♪ ♪ that 's good enough for me ♪ Oh , snap ! Kate Logan . Excuse me . Yeah . Just can 't get enough of me , can you ? Well , who can blame you ? What ? Pete , what 's wrong ? It 's Dickinson . Somebody- - guys ... We have to go to Washington , D.C. right now . Do they know the cause of death ? Massive internal bleeding and hypovolemic shock . This is an X-ray of Dickinson 's hand . It looks like every bone has been dislocated . Yeah , the carpals usually sit right against the radius , but there 's a half an inch between them . Every joint in his body looks like that , as if he was pulled apart . My God . What the hell could have done this ? The only word for it is " freaky . " That 's why I called you . That 's what you do , right ? Weird and freaky . The pain- - it just must have been ... Would you give us a minute ? Right . Super secret weird and freaky . I 'll be outside . I just- - I can 't believe this . Why ? I don 't care what it takes , but we are not gonna stop till we know who 's responsible for this . Pete ... It 's me . This is my fault . ♪ Warehouse 13 2x09 ♪ Vendetta Original Air Date on August 31 , 2010 Artie , what do you mean this is your fault ? How can this be your fault ? Artie , just- - just talk to us . What did this ? You wouldn 't have thought it was anything- - just an old , rusty chain . What chain ? The rack the chain from Torquemada 's rack . What ? Who is this Torquemada woman ? A different rack entirely . Tomas de Torquemada- - the Grand Inquisitor- - he was the driving force behind the Spanish Inquisition . If the holder pulls the chain taut and focuses his energy on the victim , then it induces the same kind of bone-wrenching agony ... That was suffered on the rack . That 's why Dickinson 's bones were all ... Twisted and wrenched from their sockets . I 'm sorry . I 'm so , so sorry . Artie , I just don 't understand . How is this your fault ? Well ... In the ' 70s , I had some dealings with the Soviet Union . No , no , no . Artie , we know all that . Okay , pre-Warehouse , you worked for the NSA . You traded secrets to the Russians . They were gonna charge you with treason . But Mrs. Frederic fixed it . You didn 't trade secrets ... Did you ? Artifacts ? Just trinkets . I thought that they were antiques , old relics that the Soviets were willing to trade for . What , wait , trade- - trade what--money ? No . People- - political prisoners rotting in the Gulags . You traded artifacts ... For people ? It was a different world , Myka . Berlin Wall ... Nuclear stockpiling , persecution of Soviet Jews . What was a rusty old chain compared to a human life ? I didn 't know it was an artifact . Hey , man ... I 'd have done the same thing . And then , one day , my Russian contact let slip that these old trinkets ... Had power . And pretty soon , I discovered that many of these things had frightening , dangerous power and I couldn 't live with the guilt , so I- - so you turned yourself in . And that was the day Mrs. Frederic came into my life . She made me an offer , a chance to make amends for past mistakes . That 's why she gave you a new name . Arthur Weisfelt died that day , and Artie Nielsen was born . Look , that 's a hell of a story , Artie , but what 's it got to do with Dickinson ? Why him ? I don 't know . But we are gonna find out . ... Glory are yours , forever and ever . Amen . Amen . I 'm just gonna take a walk . Okay . Is she okay ? As okay as you can be at a friend 's funeral . It 's a bloody rotten business . What are you doing here ? Same as you- - tracking Torquemada 's chain . It was on our most-desired list in Warehouse 12 . Well , you know what ? You are actually on Artie 's most-desired list . So unless you want to be bronzed again- - he 's still opposed to my returning as an Agent ? Well , he 's opposed to your existence . So , yeah , I would say that extends to you- - this is absurd . I saved your life . I saved Claudia 's life . I 've--I 've proven I can be trusted . More than not , I 've proven that I 'm of value . I 'm not questioning your value . I 'm curious about your motives . Myka , I can 't . I don 't belong in this world . The Warehouse is- - I 'm gonna need more than that . I 'm gonna need more than ... " She doesn 't like the world . " I need the truth . Why did they bronze you ? What--what did you do that the Regents felt that they had to encase you in- - I asked to be bronzed . You asked ? You ... Who in their right mind would- - I wasn 't in my right mind . My daughter , my Christina , had been murdered- - a senseless crime , brutal and senseless . I had to try to ... To change it . And I was working in a place where miracles happen . There had to be something , some way to bring her back or to turn back time . I spent years desperately combing the shelves of Warehouse 12 . Twice I was discovered and brought before the Regents . Twice they were lenient and gave me a reprieve . The third time ... My recklessness cost the life of a fellow Agent . I was distraught and quite mad , I 'm afraid . I had become a danger . So I asked , and they said yes . I suppose I hoped to awaken in a different world , a better one . The bronzer was your time machine . Closest I could come . I 'll talk to Artie . Thank you . Um , this is how to reach me in D.C. Myka ... I 'm sorry about your friend . Ah , we sure missed you when you left the NSA . Beauty and brains . Thanks , Joe . Oh , it turns out that I found my calling . Oh , do I want to know what that means ? No , no . Never mind . I don 't . As long as you love what you 're doing , right ? Yeah . Yeah . Right . Uh , thanks , but I 'm really not hungry . I made tuna melts . Tuna melts ? Okay , you buried the lead . I 'm standing in front of a dead woman . You two have to live in the same town . Work it out . I 'll go get some lemonade . If Claudia won 't come to the hardware store ... The hardware store will come to Claudia ? Cute . Ooh , brackets . You shouldn 't have . Yeah , so ... So ... How 's life ? Good ? If by " good " you mean excruciatingly boring , then , yeah , my life 's good . Yeah , mine 's really good . I 've been thinking about you . Ironic- - you broke up with me . I know . I guess I just didn 't think you 'd cut out of my life completely . I can do black . I can do white . Not so good with gray . You mix black paint with white paint . You 've got to get out of that hardware store , at least to find some new metaphors . So does that mean we could maybe be friends ? Friends ... Sounds grayish . The thing is , Claudia ... I got to go . I 'm--I 'm sorry , I- - you 're leaving ? I-I 'll call you later , I promise . I 'm--I 'm really sorry . I-I promise I-I 'll call you . What happened ? I have no frakkin ' idea . Dude was here , got a text , dude is gone . Well , men are generally out of touch with their emotions . I mean , look at Pete and Artie . Those are my choices ? They say one thing , and they do another , because they 're not exactly sure how they feel . Mixed signals cover all possibilities . Exactly . How am I supposed to respond to that , Leena , with a big smile or with gunfire ? With patience . Give him time . Patience ? Right . Oh , no , I can be patient . Actually , no , I can 't . Sanchez , are you back from lunch already ? Could you- - who are you ? How did you get in here ? Uhh ! Artie ... Pete 's just looking through the rest of the security-camera footage . This is where you found him ? It was quick and quiet . People in the other offices didn 't hear a thing . Artie , it- - it 's 70 degrees here , but--but the prelim says that he died of hypothermia . Did--did the chain also ... ? The Titanic . There was a piece of driftwood . It was pried from the arms of one of the victims . It became imbued with ... Certain properties . Another one you traded ? The coincidence doesn 't escape me either . If someone wanted Joe dead , then NSA headquarters is not the easiest place to take him out . I think whatever they were after was right here . And I want to know what . You 're never gonna get in . The NSA 's system is so much tighter than ours- - I 'm in . I 'm surprised it took you that long . Maybe I shouldn 't be here while you hack NSA files . Well , the mainframe was not accessed , so whatever they were looking for was only in this computer ... Here . And the last file accessed was ... It 's just a list of Russian names and addresses . What ? Artie , what 's the connection ? Me . These are names of people that I got released from the Gulag . It 's a list of my relatives . These people are your family ? Hey , guys , so I went through the internal security feed . There 's something you 're gonna want to see . Okay , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , right there . H.G. Wells- - what is she doing now ? And why is she coming after me ? Look , maybe she was here for other reasons . Like what ? Applying for a job ? No , like hunting down whatever artifact that did this , so she can prove herself and rejoin the Warehouse . Myka , how do you know that ? I ... May have ... Spoken to her . Oh , man ! You 've been talking to H.G. ? Let me understand this . You spoke to H.G. Wells about official Warehouse 13 matters , and you didn 't tell me ? I was waiting for the right time . This ain 't it . You , of all people- - you accuse me of keeping secrets , and then you go and do something like this ? Hey , hey , hey . No , hey . You know what , Artie ? No , no , no . This is good . This is good , because , uh , now we have a lead . And--and we know that H.G. is involved , and all we have to do is find her , and--and thank God that Myka is so good at that . I know where she is- - the , um , Archer Hotel . I guess we 're going . Yeah . All right . All right , Claude , you can do this . Just walk up to him and say- - dah hah hah . And I 'm officially stalking him . Okay . Well , who 's the girl ? Her name 's Claudia . Claudia ? Yeah . What does she do ? She just works at a Warehouse . That 's all you know ? An I.R.S. Warehouse . Zoinks ! Ah , took you long enough . Finally looked at the envelope , did you ? Torquemada 's chain- - where is it ? Well , I don 't have it . I 've been looking for it since 1894 . I 'm trying to help you , Artie . How do we know you didn 't kill Dickinson or Joe Sweetwood ? What possible reason would have ? Hadn 't you rather be looking for the person who was photographing Artie at Dickinson 's funeral ? Photographing me ? I followed him , but by the time I got inside the NSA , it was too late . He left something on Mr. Sweetwood 's body . I imagine it has significance to you . What ? What was it ? I 'm more than happy to share my information , but I expect a little quid pro quo . Nothing . I tell you nothing . Right . Good luck , then . Artie , wait . Maybe she has some information- - no , she is a killer , and she belongs in the bronze sector . You don 't know that ! And I will not be blackmailed ! It 's a lead . Artie , we need leads . All right . What is it ? In the bible on the nightstand . What does it mean ? Alexander ... He 's calling me out . Who ? It 's my Soviet contact . Whenever he wanted to meet , he would leave a King of Hearts . But I thought he was in prison . Yeah , well , looks like he 's out ... And obviously not for good behavior . He went after Dickinson , because Dickinson knew that Arthur Weisfelt had become Artie Nielsen . By killing Joe , this guy gets the list of all your relatives in Russia . He 's going after your family . That 's all the quid pro quo you 're gonna get . This guy must want you to know what he 's doing . But why ? Artie , why was Alexander sent to prison ? When I turned myself in , he became useless to his government . He was a liability . By the time I found that out ... It was too late . So , revenge ? I have to get to Moscow . No , Artie , that 's exactly what he wants . He 's coming after my family . We 're going too . It 's too dangerous . Oh , don 't even bother . ♪ ♪ Weisfelt instruments . Yeah . It 's quite the family resemblance . And he teaches music , just like my father . Why don 't you go in and say hello ? No , no . That would put him in even more danger . We 've never met . The family thinks that Arthur Weisfelt 's dead . It should stay that way . Man , this is a huge list . Was your whole family tree subversive ? Well , no . I had several cousins who were refuseniks . Those days , when one was grabbed , whole family was grabbed . So how are we supposed to warn and protect everyone- - we 're not . We 're gonna find Alexander first . I got it . We find the bastard , and then we go in guns blazing . We 're not gonna do any blazing . We 're gonna keep a low profile . This visit is not exactly government sanctioned . So no help from the local authorities and no diplomatic immunity . None . What could they do to us ? You two- - they yell at you , and they send you home . And what about you ? I didn 't change my name to hide from our government . As far as the Russians are concerned , I 'm a spy who betrayed them , so ... See , that 's something you could 've brought up on the plane . This is the safe house where ... Alexander and I used to meet . Alexander was a creature of habit . If he 's not here now , he will be soon . Well , finally we 're one step ahead of this guy . He 's on the roof . Son of a bitch . Grenade ! No . Croquet ball . Croquet ball . Oh , God . If he 's got the other one ... Get down ! Down ! Whoa ! Whoa ! All right , stay down . Stay down ! What , is this another old friend of yours , Artie ? Yeah , it 's Charles II 's croquet ball , imbued with the fury of a King and a sore loser . Oh , interesting sidebar- - later ! Oh ! So how do we stop it ? We don 't ! It 's got to stop on its own . It could take hours . The ball is lethal ! Stay out of its way ! Okay , I think I can make it to the door and then see if I can spot him . Artie , be careful ! Pete , get down ! Uhh ! Oh-ho . Bye-bye . Aah ! Ohh ! Myka , do you think you can get to the old fridge ? What , are you hungry now ? Just be prepared to open it , okay ? Right . Okay . Okay . Ready ? One ... Two ... Go ! Whoa . Pete , behind you ! Oh ! Little league , don 't fail me now ! Whoa ho ho ho ho ! Wakah ! Pete ... Artie 's outside . Artie ! Well , this isn 't good . You getting a vibe ? Don 't need one . Yeah , I 'm here . Who are the ... Fighting Ocelots ? Hmm ? Claude , you have a post-it kind of stuck on your ... Hey , you find any info on Alexander ? We 've run into a real dead end here . Uh , I pulled an all-nighter digging for intel . And ... Nada . The Soviets must have disappeared him . I 'm running some needle-in-a-haystack programs right now , but I 'm gonna need a little more info . Could you put Artie on a sec ? Can 't . He 's- - Artie got hungry , and he went out for some borscht . Just , uh , get back to us . There 's no use in panicking Claudia . I mean , there 's not much she can do from there . There 's not much we can do from here . And now I want borscht . Wow . Is that all on Alexander ? This is on Alexander . This is on Todd . And I 'm not stalking him . But look at this picture I took of him . Look at that . See the guy he 's talking to ? He 's totally packing heat ... In Univille . I mean , I saw that , I figured ... Maybe I should dig a little deeper . School records , tax--dental records . Claudia , that 's a little stalker-y . What did you find out ? Nothing , until you get behind the data . All of this info was entered on the same day six months ago , right before Todd showed up in our sleepy , little hamlet . Leena , what if Todd is trying to use me to get into the Warehouse ? I think I should go to town and- - no , you should stay away from him until Artie gets back . Claudia . You 're right . You 're right . That 's exactly what I was thinking . Guess I 'll just , uh , figure out which shelf to put this thing on . I 'll do that . I 'll do it . I 'll do it . Okay . Too easy . Claudiola- - I was just thinking about you . Toddarama- - settle a bet for Pete and me . He thinks there 's no High School with an Ocelot mascot , but I thought you said your high-school football team had one , right ? Did we talk about this ? Yeah , the Fighting Ocelots . I knew it ! The undefeated Ocelots . Pride and Joy of my youth . Listen , I was thinking . We should totally be friends and hang out . Nice segue . How about Friday ? How about now ? Sounds good . Pond in the park in , say , 45 ? Make it 40 . Great . Okay , we can 't go to the local police , and we certainly can 't go to the government . We don 't know how to call Mrs. Frederic . Well , all right , what about- - hold it . What ? What ? What is this ? What is- - ah , ã for crying out loud . I think someone 's watching us . Why don 't you just say that ? 'Cause I 'm trying to act nonchalant . Oh , good job . All right . So , um , I still want you to go that way . Mm-hmm . Okay ? And then I 'm gonna go- - I 'm gonna go this way . Okay . Take the bag , okay ? We 'll see who he follows . Okay . All right , babe . Well , I 'll see you later . I 'll see you at dinner . Give me some sug- - just go with it . All right . Was that really necessary ? Hey , you . You mind telling me what you 're doing here ? Hi . You remember me ? We really don 't have time for this . How did you find us ? Receiver- - tells me the exact coordinates of the transmitter I slipped into Myka 's pocket at the cemetery , and before you get angry- - I 'm not angry . Just tell me you also slipped one of those into Artie 's pocket too . Artie 's gone ? He was kidnapped . Probably by the same person who killed Dickinson and Sweetwood . We could use your help . Wait , Myka , no . Artie would blow a gasket . Pete , we need help , and she 's here . And for the record , I knew that you slipped this in my pocket at the cemetery . I-I thought you 'd know . I knew you 'd think that . Oh , all right . Look , we think he might have been taken by his former Soviet contact . That 's impossible . How do you know that ? It couldn 't have been Alexander . That 's why Claudia 's trail ran cold . You mind filling me in here ? Alexander died 13 years ago . Alexander . Alexei ? It 's you , isn 't it ? Why ? Some kind of revenge ? Uhh ! Alexander , listen ... What we did ... Was wrong . The artifacts were dangerous . They needed to be locked away . That 's why I turned myself in . I didn 't know that they would punish you . Save your breath . You 'll need it . Who the hell are you ? The last person you 'll ever see . Arthur Weisfelt ... The man I spend my entire life hating . Oh , my God . You look just like ... It 's Ivan , right ? Ivan . You 're Alexander 's son . No . To be a son , you would need a father . Mine spent his entire life in prison because of you . Not me- - your government did that . You caused it . They gave you a new life ... While my father died in a cell . Now it 's your turn . Do you really think we should be going through Artie 's bag ? Yes , Pete ! Of course ! Unless you have a better idea ! Okay , okay . Two Mykas- - this is gonna be fun . Hey , a compass--maybe this is some sort of homing device that always points at Artie . No , no , that would be too easy . Holy crap ! W-what does that do ? It holds Artie 's glasses . Right , so I can understand your excitement . But Artie always loses his glasses , which is why Claudia rigged them so he could always find them ! Is this the receiver ? No , he lost that weeks go . But ... I know someone who has one . Good job ! You made it . Of course . I said I would . People say a lot of things . They do , they do . Hey , you don 't drive an old el Camino , do you ? Me ? No , it 's Artie 's , actually . I hardly ever ... Ah , screw it . What the hell is that ? I 'm asking the questions here , starting with who the hell are you ? Me ? You don 't exist . You 're six months old . Why were you spying on me ? I figured you out , man . Think you can use me to get into the Warehouse ? What do I care about an I.R.S. Warehouse ? Bet you 're just as bad as MacPherson . You just want to- - wait , what ? Who 's MacPherson ? You think it 's an I.R.S. Warehouse ? Isn 't it ? Or ha ! Is that just your cover , working for John Conti ? John Conti ? Who the hell 's Jo- - wait , John Conti , the mobster ? Dude , I don 't work for him . Then what the hell is going on ? Oh , Todd , you 're in trouble . Trying hard not to be . Was the Marshal right ? Am I a dead man ? No , no , of course not . You 're ... Jinkies . You 're in the Witness Protection program , aren 't you ? Man , you didn 't know ? No , I thought ... Man , how the hell 'd you get yourself into the program ? I was just an I.T. guy Conti hired to recover a hard drive . I saw some files I wasn 't supposed to , and all of a sudden , I 'm living in this weird town in South Dakota . I-I wanted to tell you , but I couldn 't . And that--that guy I saw you with was- - my handler . He 's pretty pissed at me right now . I wasn 't supposed to get close to anybody , let alone fall in love with them . Wait a second . Back that up . Okay . " Love " is a really strong word . No , no , no . Further back . You mean you really are a techie after all ? Monster . Dude . The light is flashing . He should be right here . I guess he was . This way . Oh , my God . You 've got the jacks . So killing those men and the list of my family , that was for what- - just to--to- - to get me here ? Ivan , no . Don 't--don 't- - don 't use that . It doesn 't just affect victims . Whoever uses it , it--it--it infects your soul , steals your humanity . And the longer you have it , the more like Torquemada you become . Good . That will make this easier . Okay , where now ? You guys take this corridor . I 'll go this way . Just help me with this door . Why don 't you just yell , " here we come " ? Hey ! Be careful . Hey ! What ? Come on . Artie . Artie . Oh , come on ! There 's got to be another way . Oh ! What ? Shh . What ? It 's okay . What are you ? Don 't , no . Shh . Behind you . It 's okay . Y-you don 't need to do this . It takes a few minutes . I want to watch you watch your friend die . Let her die . I don 't care . She means nothing to me . This woman who risks her life to save yours ? I see it 's still very hazardous to be your friend . There 's no time . What are you doing ? Oh , jeez . Let 's see what this thing does . Okay . And ... Go ! And ... Activate ! Fire ! Come on ! Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait ! It 's a reflex hammer , right ? Sure . Okay , well ... Now , that 's cool . Let 's go . Yeah . Why ? Ivan , why ? What 's the point ? What are you gonna do ? You just gonna kill people who have absolutely nothing to do with this ? Don 't worry . Don 't worry . Her death will be quick . Not yours . Take this . Hold this tight . It 's the only thing that 'll reverse it . Hold it tight ! You 'll be all right . You all right ? Yeah , yeah . That was a good shot , by the way , unless you were shooting at Ivan . If I 'd shot him , you 'd still be chained there . And I would have frozen to death . That was some good thinking . You 'll be all right . You 'll be all right . Well , that wasn 't so hard . Say it again . Oh , come on . Please ? For me . My preferred method of hacking is to use an integrated secure toolkit applied a safe-type concurrent algorithm derived from an active binary work cluster embedded in a synchronized metalevel high-speed architecture . I love it when you talk tech . He 's gonna be here soon . This sucks . We can finally talk . I finally feel like I 'm getting to know you . Aw . Suckity , suckity , suck , suck , suck . Oh . Sorry , my handlers are just too freaked . They think I 'll be safer someplace else . But , hey , if I live to testify , I 'll come back . Oh , that 's an interesting brush-off . I could always just send Conti into an interdimensional space . What 's that ? Tell you later ? Not fair . Todd ... Time to go . You know I 'll find you . You better . How could you ? You turned her in . You handed her over to the Regents without even considering that she might be a valuable asset and- - Myka . What makes you think that this was his decision , Agent Bering ? You seriously believe that there 's not a thorough and complete vetting process by which the agents of Warehouse 13 are selected ? Mrs. Frederic recommends . Regents discuss . And I make the final decision . Artie ... So who 's this guy now ? Mr. Kosan , Agent Lattimer , Agent Bering . Adwin Kosan is ... On a need-to-know basis , and you don 't need to know . You make the decisions . Some of them . Yes . We have to trust that Mr. Kosan will make the right choice . The choice has been made . Has she been bronzed , then ? Ms. Wells ? This is thanks in no small part to Agent Bering 's report . To Agent Bering 's re- - I tried to tell you , but- - in conjunction with our findings , H.G. Wells is to be fully reinstated as a Warehouse Agent . She 's convinced the Regents that she 's no longer a threat , but an asset . Welcome home , Agent Wells . Thank you , sir . Agent Wells . Reinstated ? Be it ever so humble . Thank you . Without you , I wouldn 't be here . Well , I would , but I 'd be in bronze . Welcome to the team , I guess , yeah ? Thank you . No . This is wrong . Artie ... This is wrong ! Artie ! Artie ? Artie ! Wait ! Artie , wait ! Artie , don 't you dare just walk away . We went to Russia so we could right the wrongs from your past . Don 't you think that H.G. deserves the same chance ? You 're saying that she 's just like me ? You 're wrong . She 's nothing like me ! And no matter how much good she 's done for all of us , I 'll never trust that woman . But if the Regents are sure , don 't you think you should- - oh , now you want to know what I think . I think I 'm gonna regret not letting her freeze to death . But by then , it 'll be too late ... For all of us .

 Previously on " The 100 " ... You started a war that you don 't know how to end . You have no idea what your people have done , the forces you unleashed . We had to stop the attack . You stopped nothing . We have to get out of here while we still got the chance . I love you . Not the way that I want to be loved , not the way that you love Clarke . It 's over , Finn . The dropship is still tied in to all of our major systems . If it launches , the Ark will be crippled , and everyone left on board will die . Launch ! You mom is early . Something is wrong . First watch is over . Go relieve Monroe on the south wall . Keep your eyes open . Anything ? It 's been two days . Maybe the bomb at the bridge scared them off for good . You believe that ? No . They 're coming . Jasper thinks he can cook up some more gunpowder , if he gets some sulfur , and Raven says she can turn that into landmines . So be careful where you step . Ha ! Funny . What I really need is 1,000 more of her tin can bombs I can roll into their village and blow those grounders to hell . That 's what they want to do to us . Can 't believe we survived 100 years just so we could slaughter each other . There has to be another way . Any word from the Ark ? Radio silence . Finally ran out of air . Maybe my mom was lucky being on the exodus ship . At least it was quick . No one is coming down to save us . Hello ? Is anyone there ? Hello ? Let 's get this party smoking . You don 't want the fire too big . So maybe just try to knock it down with some wet leaves . You get that from your boyfriend , grounder pounder ? She 's right . A hot fire is not gonna preserve the meat as well . You can 't take the heat , get out of the smokehouse . Should be kissing our asses for being allowed back in this camp . Just keep working . Your brother couldn 't get you a better job ? Would think anything would be better than working in the meat furnace . Oh , probably . That just means someone else would have to do it . What 's for dinner ? Split loads , turning one bullet into two . It 's all I can do until we get more gunpowder . Jasper has a recipe . Yesterday I saw him taking buckets from the latrine . I didn 't ask . Is one of those for me ? Maybe . Still deciding . I keep wanting to apologize again . You don 't have to . We 're good . I got to get this done . - That 's bad . - What ? When you 're really pissed off , you always find a project , something to keep your hands busy so you don 't punch someone in the face . I 'm not keeping busy , Finn . I 'm keeping us alive . Yeah . You 're right . That was a dumb thing to say . See you later . Wait . We 're good . We 're good . We are . I just want you to be happy . Whoa ! Guys ! Fire ! Go , go , go ! All right . Come on . Are you ok ? This is all your fault . We told you it was too much wood . Get the hell away from me . Hey ! Hey ! Hey , stop ! Save it for the grounders . Well , now what the hell are we gonna do ? That was all the food . Any idea what happened ? Murphy says that Del kept feeding the fire , mostly because Octavia told him it was a bad idea . - And we believe Murphy ? - I do . Yeah . We have some wild onions and nuts in the dropship . It 's only enough to last us maybe one or two weeks . What 's left here ? Nothing . It all burned . Then we have to hunt . Anyone we can spare goes out . The whole grounder army out there ? Look . We can 't defend ourselves if we 're starving . Each group takes someone with a gun , and they 're for killing grounders , not food . We don 't have the ammo . Use the spears for hunting . Get what you can . Be back by nightfall . No one stays out after dark . Hey , Clarke ... You alone ? You maybe want to go together ? Sure . I 'll get some gear . You ready to go ? I don 't think so . Come on . I 'm a good tracker . You 're lousy with a spear , but you 're sneaky . We make a good team . Hey , partner , we 're wasting daylight . Oh , Finn , you 're joining the band ? - Sure . - Awesome . Haven 't really got a chance to hang with you guys much . Hey , do you even know how I got arrested on the Ark ? I 'm dying to hear about it . We need more ammo . That 's it till Jasper gets back . Now get out of my tent . Where you going ? The hell out of here . No way . You 're not leaving . Really ? And what makes you think you can tell me what to do ? Aren 't you a janitor ? Where you gonna go ? Into these damn woods . Don 't worry about it . I 'll find someplace safe . Just wait . Don 't be an idiot . You go alone , and you 're dead or worse . So what 's your plan , sit here until you run out of bullets ? Yeah ... Or until you come up with something better . Come on , Raven . You came down here in a pod you rebuilt yourself . You made a bomb out of a tin can . What else you got in that head of yours ? Radios . We can 't defend ourselves if we can 't communicate . If we can build radios , walkie-talkies ... Then we can fight as a team . We 'd have a chance , at least . See ? We need you . You may be a huge pain in the ass , but you 're smart . Anybody there ? Hello ? ♪ 56 bottles of beer on the wall ♪ - ♪ 56 bottles of beer ♪ - Hello ? ♪ Take one down and pass it around ♪ ♪ 55 bottles of beer on the wall ♪ ♪ 55 bottles of beer on the wall ♪ - Hello ? - ♪ 55 bottles of beer ♪ ♪ take one down , pass it around ♪ Hey , hey , can you hear me ? What do you want ? Councilor , sir ? It 's Wick , isn 't it , from engineering , Sinclair 's apprentice ? Yeah , yeah . He had me come down here to override the containment codes to keep the doors open . Don 't tell him I messed up . Hey ... You didn 't mess up . We need to get your arm free . Yeah . Let 's do that . That sounds like a good idea . Did you see anyone else around here ? No . Heard there was a hull breach in engineering . It was a breach ? What the hell happened , anyway ? We were betrayed . Councilor Sydney , she took the Exodus ship by force . Damage to the Ark was catastrophic . What a bitch . My mom voted for her . I 'm not gonna be able to open these doors without some help . I 'll be right back . You can 't leave me , man . I won 't leave you here . All right . Dude ... Aagh ! Ah , my God , thank you . That was gr ... Easy . I can hear the pumps . I think the vents are working up ahead . Let 's go . If you survived , there could be others . It 's like a ghost ship . One of those scaly panther things ? Boar . Good , because that panther meat is nasty , but I could eat a whole boar by myself , no joke . You know what the best part is of the boar ? It 's gonna sound gross . Myles , quiet for a second . What is it ? These tracks . They 're perfect . Too perfect . We 're the ones being hunted . I don 't see anything . Myles . Clarke , come on . We got to leave him . - Clarke ... - No . Ah , yeah . Here . Hey , how 's the air in here ? Crappy . I 'm gonna check the next few compartments . Whoa , hey , are you sure you want to do that ? This ship took a lot of damage . You walk through the wrong door , you could be stepping out into space . We need to keep moving . The air in here can turn bad at any time . At least we 're breathing . The co2 scrubbers down here have kicked back on . They can restart themselves ? No . The electrical fires blew out a DCDU . Everything is on manual . Is it getting cooler in here ? I don 't feel it . Could someone restart the central cooling exchanges in this level ? No . That runs through the primary board . Earth monitoring . We need to get these people moving now . Move them where ? The cooling air is a message . See , I think there 's someone alive in earth monitoring . - The air is a message . - Yeah . Ok . You have hypoxia , all right ? So you 're working with about 10 % of your brain . We need to get them moving now . I am not gonna let these people die here . Yeah . We walked for about 3 miles after crossing that creek , another two or so before we got to the road . I don 't think it matters , Finn . They don 't blindfold us , which means they don 't care what we saw . They 're probably gonna kill us . What do you want from us ? Help her . If she dies , he dies . Rest in peace , earth monitoring . Let 's check passageway 4 . No . We got a jammed pressure door between us and pass . 4 , and we can 't get through here . It 's game over , man . I need to talk to whoever is in there . " Please " would be nice . Watch this . Earth monitoring , do you read ? We read you . Who is this ? Where are you ? Sir , it 's good to hear your voice . Of course it 's you , Kane . You 're too stubborn to die . I could say the same for you . What is your situation ? We have about a dozen survivors . That 's good work , Councilor . Sinclair is rerouting power and air to the mess hall . Lead your people there . After we get you . No . A fire burned through most of our oxygen . We put it out , but we don 't have very long . No . A fire burned through all access is blocked . We are reviving as many ark citizens as we can before our oxygen runs out . I won 't leave you to die . As your chancellor , I am ordering you to gather as many survivors as you can and lead them to the mess hall . Jaha out . Lead them to the mess hall , and when you get there , organize a search station by station . Look for survivors . Let 's go to the mess hall . Come on . Hey , the chancellor is right . We all got to get out of here . This whole deck is an electrical fire waiting to happen . That 's why you need to lead these people out of here ... please . So , what , you 're got to save everybody but yourself ? This is nuts . No one else can die because of me . Go . Go . Get yourselves to safety . On 3 . 1 , 2 , 3 . Her name is Tris . I can 't do this . I don 't have any equipment . We 'll provide you with what we can . Why do you think I can save her ? - Lincoln told her . - Yes . Our healer is gone . There 's nothing we can do for her . For his sake , I hope you can . Clarke , you can do this . Wait . What happened to her ? She was on the bridge when your bomb exploded . You did this to her . I found some good antenna wire for the radios . This guy was using it to fix his bed . You find anything else from the exodus ship wreckage ? Yeah , data log . Want to hear something weird ? Sounds like interference . Wait . It get weirder . When the signal hit , their nav. system went nuts . They never got it back , and then ... boom . It 's like something was jamming the signal . That is weird . It also makes no sense whatsoever . No . Pull the drive-in speakers . You want to strip it ? We 'll never find out where they crashed . We need every component we can get our hands on if we 're gonna make walkies ... and I need the radio . No way . How are we supposed to contact the Ark ? The Ark is not there . You 're listening to a hole in the sky . Hey , my family is up there . I 'm sorry . The hunters are back ? Is Finn with them ? I don 't think so . Hey , relax . I 'm sure Clarke is keeping him out of trouble . What are you doing in here ? They don 't waste time . I 'll get them that . What 's it been , day and a half ? Mistaken me for someone who cares . Time to move on . What are you doing ? Moving on . I 've never been with anyone but Finn . Take off your clothes . Fine . I 'll go first . If you 're looking for someone to talk you down , tell you that you 're just upset and not thinking straight , I 'm not that guy . Good . She 's getting worse . Help me lift her up . Oh , my God , here we go . She 's not moving any air on the left . There 's fluid pressing on her lungs . I don 't see an entry wound . No . It wasn 't shrapnel . It was trauma . The force of the explosion , it hit her in the chest . She 's drowning in her own blood . She can 't breathe . I have to relieve the pressure . I need a small tube , something rigid the size of my finger . Here . Thanks . Fifth intercostal space . This better work . You 're ok . Attagirl . Breathe . What have you done ? No . You don 't understand . She couldn 't breathe . Back off ! Everybody gets oxygen now . Sir ... Sir , are you all right ? I gave you an order . You 're bound by law to follow . The people in this room are our best chance to save the Ark . Besides , a wise man once told me ... I needed to learn when not to follow the law . Heh heh . A wise man . Thank you . So what do we do now ? She 's breathing a little better , but even if we can save her , what happens then ? Then maybe we don 't die today . She 's hot . Her heart rate is way up . She 's probably septic . What does that mean ? It means her blood is poisoned . What about this stuff ? That slows bleeding . Coagulant . No . Lincoln had that same stuff at the dropship . I don 't see any antibiotics . Maybe that lake seaweed ? She doesn 't need seaweed . She needs real medicine . How could you send a little girl into battle ? What is wrong with you people ? She was with me . She was my second . It 's how we train them to be warriors . Oh , so the killing can just go on and on . Clarke ... You put the bomb on the bridge . You did this to her . She needs clean blood . Transfusion ? Ok . There 's no tubing . So we need a syringe , the biggest one you can find , and I need a cannula . It 's like a hollow needle . Did that help ? No . Any word yet on casualties ? No . Sinclair still has teams out assessing the damage , but ... whole stations may have been lost . I estimate no more than 1,000 survivors ... at least 1,500 dead . Hey , guys , I found something . I 'm sorry , sir . Mr. Wick has trouble with protocol . What did you find ? Data from the Exodus launch . The monitor says that service hatch beta was manually sealed before the launch from our side . There was someone in the service bay . But there are survivors ? People jumped ship at the last moment ? Maybe Sydney threw them off . Maybe they were a threat . Could they still be alive in the service bay ? Well , sir , if they hunkered down and got lucky , yeah , they could still be ticking , but they won 't be for long . Well , how do we get to them ? How can we get to them ? We could try the maintenance shaft . It 's sealed on both sides , so you 'd have pressurization . And it 's pressed right up against the fuel pods . Without power to the coolant system , it 'll be hot as hell in there . I have to try . It 's as sharp as it 's gonna get . All right . Thanks . Bleach . Guess there 's no moonshine . Ok . I 'm gonna need your blood . No . You 're from the same tribe . It 's the best match we 're gonna get . Clarke , if you 're gonna do something , you have to do it now . Just use mine . I can 't find a vein . She 's clamping down . She 's lost too much blood . - Clarke ... - Oh , come on . She 's not breathing . Take him away and kill him . No . No . No . No ! No . No . I did everything I could . No ! Clarke , stop . They 'll hurt you . No . Get off . No . Hey ... You 'll need this battery to open up the door to the bay . Good ? Yeah ? It 's not that hot . Sinclair doesn 't know what he 's talking about . It 's a little warm . So you 're not gonna talk me out of going ? Nope . When you die , can I have your shoes ? They 're much too stylish for you . You finished the walkies . Hey ... I 'm sorry about before , really , and about your family . Thanks . So all the hunters are back except Clarke and Finn . Ok . Raven , they were with another kid ... Myles . They all left camp together . All 3 of them are still out there ? Yeah . We 're going to look for them . Bring the walkies . Come on . Hey ... hey , wake up . Hey ... Abby ? Abby , wake up . It 's so hot . Anya will take no pleasure in your friend 's death . Prove your worth , and you 'll be welcome here . I couldn 't save Tris . Why would you want me ? We told you . Our healer is gone . Will I be able to go back to see them ... my friends , my home ? Tomorrow there 'll be nothing to go back to . Those marks on her shoulder , what were they ? Lincoln has them , too . Each scar marks a kill in combat . 5 kills ? She was a little girl . She was brave . How many do you have ? That 's a lot . And half were after I hurt my knee . Where are they ? We 'll find them . I thought you said you were heading west . Where are you ? Just keep the moon on your left , and you 'll find us . This morning , all I could think about was how much easier this would all be if Finn was just ... Gone . You didn 't wish this into being , Raven . Stop torturing yourself . Is anyone else hearing this signal ? Just keep your eyes open . I think it 's the same thing we heard in the black box . Damn it , Monty , pay attention . Do you see anything ? Report . Oh , my God . There 's someone in the bushes . Myles ? Myles , what happened ? Where are they ? Clarke and Finn , where are they ? Grounders took them . Take it easy . We have to get him back to camp . Bell , what about Clarke and Finn ? Raven , I 'm sorry . We need to make a stretcher . Monty , we 're heading home . You copy ? Monty , can you hear me ? Monty ... Monty , where the hell are you ? Report . Monty ...

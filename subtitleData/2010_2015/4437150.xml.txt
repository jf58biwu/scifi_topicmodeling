 You ready to go ? Yeah , I think so . And you 're absolutely sure about this , right ? Pretty sure , yeah . There 's nothing I can do to change your mind at this point ? Elspeth , no . Please , don 't make this harder than it already is . It 's okay . Hey , you know I hate it when you do that . So you 're coming back after you drop me off ? Yeah . There are just a couple of things I need to grab . Don 't want the movers busting you . Here , don 't forget your pills . Thanks . - You 've got my key , right ? - Yeah . Here it is . Oh ... Attention all passengers in the concourse : This will be your final boarding call for flight 1102 with non-stop service to ... Excuse me . You 're Dr. Gray ... Cole Gray , aren 't you ? Yeah . Why ? I work at the Facility . Security . You 're headed there for the position , right ? Yep . I start tomorrow . You live close to the Facility , right ? Yeah , I kinda have to . You wanna share a cab ? That won 't be necessary , gentlemen . Miss Strack ? What are you doing here ? I 'm picking up our newest researcher . And you too , from the looks of it . It 's nice to see you again , Cole . It 's good to finally be here . I 'm ready to get started . Great . We 're headed straight for the Facility so we can pick up your security card and clearances for tomorrow . Of course we 'll drop you off first . I don 't want Brianna getting mad at me . This way , gentlemen . Cole , this is Jason Freese . He 'll be working with you in the RD division . - Back to the Facility compound , right ? - Yeah . And that brings the number of disappearances to 12 . Another strange disturbance has cropped up in the community , this time right in town center . Julie Dylan is on location with the latest . Hey , Phil , can you come in here for a sec ? Captain , this is the third such sinkhole in the past month . Do you think the community is in any kind of danger ? I respect your conviction , son , but sometimes I don 't know why you keep this up . It 's like banging your head against the wall . I 'm pretty sure that I know why he does it . - What we know up to this point ... - Seriously ? Come on , would you guys just drop it already ? All I 'm saying is you 're not fooling anybody . Son , what your mother 's trying to say is that you , uh ... you know , you spend a lot of time with that girl . Hey , Philip , seriously , get in here and check this out . - Who 's he again ? - Andy . The tech guy ? I spend a lot of time with him too . Now what does that mean ? That means that whatever choices you 've made , we 'll love you anyway . But seriously , are you guys gonna be okay tonight while I 'm gone ? Don 't worry about it . I 'm in for the night , so I 'll be here if anything happens . Nothing 's gonna happen . Ever since I started the new meds , - I 've felt like a new woman . - Mm . Sounds like I wouldn 't want to be here anyway . Well , we have no way of knowing what 's causing these . I 'm sure there 's ... it 's probably something entirely logical . I mean what we know up to this point is that preliminary readings show no discernable danger of gases or radiation ... I just wish they 'd stop talking about those stupid holes . They weren 't creepy till the press made them creepy . - Maybe it 's the restless spirits . - Not you too . I hear enough of that in the waiting room at the doctor 's office . So we 're just cautioning people ... Sounds to me like a Public Works issue . ... to stay as far away as possible from the immediate vicinity of these disturbances . And do you think the Facility has anything to do with these disturbances ? Well , I ... I can 't comment on that . Thank you , Captain . We 'll continue bringing you these updates and more as soon as we get them . And we 're out . Miss Dylan , I 'd ... I 'd like you to know that I 'm not being vague on purpose . We really don 't know what 's going on around here , okay ? It 's ... it 's okay , just as long as you let me know as soon as you have it figured out . Douche bag . Hey , Jesse , you ready to roll ? Yeah , I 'm almost wrapped up here . That was the first real one , right ? That I 'm aware of ? Yeah . Oh , way to throw him off . Pretty smooth . - I do have my moments . - Yes , you do . You know that Cole gets in tonight . Oh , that 's right . I almost forgot , with everything going on . Mom reminded me this morning too and she wants you to call her , by the way . I 'll give her a call once we get back to the station . - And you need a haircut . - Oh , that 's cute . Ha . Here , call Cole . Thank you , Captain . We 'll continue bringing you these updates and more as soon as we have them . Well , you know what that means . Yeah , it pretty much always plays out the exact same way . You think that this is related too ? Truth is stranger than fiction and coincidences rarely happen . I bet the disappearances are related as well . Have you heard anything from anyone else yet ? Yeah , we 're gonna meet up with everybody and form a game plan . Look , once this thing goes down , we need to assume we 'll be the only ones able to get the word out . As far as I 'm concerned we 're ready to go . I have all the usual blogs and newsfeeds standing by to break things for us . Speaking of which ... I did some digging and came across a pretty interesting article . It may not be related , but like you said , coincidences rarely happen , so there you go . - What is it ? - Have you ever heard of Joseph Webber ? - I don 't think so . - Check it out . Webber went to jail for child molestation about 15 years back . It all happened within a few miles of here . He got out just a few months ago . - Guess where he lives . - Next door ? - No . - Damn . At the end of the street . You 're joking . - Serious as a heart attack . - That can 't be possible . When they release those guys , they 're supposed to relocate them far far away from the area they committed the crime in . Yeah , that 's what you would think , right ? There has to be something there . That 's just a little too strange . Wait until you hear the rest . I did some more digging and found that people pretty much had the expected reaction to Webber 's return . Even with all the brouhaha the parole board refused to move him . He gets his assed kicked almost every week like clockwork and he can 't do anything about it . But by all official accounts , he 's being a good boy ... - completely reformed . - That 's horrible and also very compelling . Who 's worse : The criminal or the society that criminalizes him ? We should talk to him . You do realize that there 's a chance that he 's involved in these disappearances , right ? Yeah , of course I do , but I 'm pretty sure he 's not involved with the massive pulsating sinkholes . We could scoop two stories at once . Well , it sounds to me like twice the work and about four times as thankless . - Well , nobody said it would be easy . - All right . You are seeing what I 'm seeing , right ? Of course ... the oblivious devil-may-care guys will triumph over Philip once again . Yeah , and it 's not even Andy 's fault . He probably doesn 't even realize what 's going on . I know . With everything going on with me , you know , I just wish that Philip could be happy for once . Is that wrong of me ? - Oh . - Sweetie , are you okay ? Oh . Yeah yeah , I 'm ... I 'm fine , really . It 's probably just a side effect of the new meds . It happens from time to time . Are you sure ? You never mentioned that to us . That 's because it was no big deal . I didn 't want you guys to worry needlessly . - Maybe Philip should have stayed . - No . I want him to come , but I want him to go . Oh , just forget about it . I just wish that Andy guy would not be around . Yeah , I know . All right , so I guess I 'll see you guys in a bit . We 're meeting him there , right ? Yeah , we 're meeting everybody at 7 : 30 . Well , we 've got some time to kill . - You wanna grab dinner or something ? - Hmm . Hey , Webber , heard you got cancer . Enjoy it , because you damn well deserve it . I know you had something to do with those missing people . And you know what ? I 'm gonna get the boys together and we 're gonna kill you , you perverted fuck . Joseph , it 's Billy from the pen . I get out next week . And when I do , I 'm gonna come by and I 'm gonna fuck you just ... So you 've seen the tests . I 'm actually appalled at the toxicity levels . I sent it back twice just to be sure there wasn 't a mistake . - Now do you believe us ? - Yeah . I don 't want to , but yeah . These guys are supposed to be curing a disease , not infecting people with another one . - So you 're with us on this ? - Of course I am . This is an outrage ! This is the worst case of corporate negligence - I 've ever seen . - Who said negligence ? All right , we have to prepare ourself for the very real possibility that this is all done on purpose ... the tumors , the disappearances , the things in the ground . Considering something like that scares the shit out of me . It scares the shit out of all of us . That 's why we have to get the word out and hopefully put a stop to it . I 'm pretty sure one-third of this town has cancer already . Do you think that we could get a copy of all those X-rays and post them on the blog ? Oh , that 's a bit morbid , don 't you think ? Yeah , maybe , but it could definitely hammer it home , you know ? Sometimes you have to shock people into action . That 's true , but we don 't really have an informant at the hospital yet , not like we do at the Facility , at least . Well , hopefully this next media blast will change all that . Apparently something huge is supposed to be happening in the next few days , so we need to get this out there like yesterday . Now , guys , keep in mind that we 're about to get our hands on some truly implicating stuff . We 've never been in with a group this large and never with video support . - Speaking of which ... - They 're on their way . Okay . Like she said , it 's not going to be easy . Security is super tight around there . Is it really necessary that we go into the belly of the beast like this ? - It 's all we got . - Yeah . This place has the media on total lockdown . We have to bring out irrefutable evidence . It 's the only way anyone would listen to us at this point . So , Jen , how do you propose we get in there to get the proof we need ? I think I might have an idea . - We have about an hour left , right ? - Yeah , that 's it . Hey , would you mind stopping right over here ? - Just for a minute . - I don 't know . Do we have time ? Sure , we 're ... we 're in no hurry . Uh , I have a few phone calls to make anyway . - What 's here ? - Jennifer . Oh . Hey . Is uh ... is Jennifer here ? Jen ? It 's for you . Ouch . Yeah , hi . The plan is to go with a soft start tomorrow and then we 'll be hitting full throttle by week 's end . Yeah , I saw it . - Hey . - Hey . You 're here already . Why didn 't you ask me to come pick you up ? Oh , they had a ride waiting for me . Nice . Hey , I was wondering , um , after I get settled in , you wanna do something later tonight ? Oh , I can 't . See , I 've got this meeting going on right now and it 's probably gonna run late . We 're still trying to figure out the new format for our website revision . You could just , you know ... you could come over or something . - Oh , I ... - Um , hey , Jen , I really think we need to get the meeting back on track , so ... Barry . So ... Actually , I 'll probably just see what Mark 's doing . He told me that he 'd be in town , so ... Well , that sounds like a good idea . Hey , why don 't I call you later ? - When we 're done , okay ? - Yeah . So you 're headed to the meeting tonight . So you 're headed to the meeting tonight . Yeah , we 're heading down there in a bit . Just gonna go by the house and get a quick bite to eat first . You guys need to ... tonight . She 's moving up ... the ... table . You 're breaking up . Say it again . You guys have to ... tonight . I think she 's ... the timetable . I said you have to get in there tonight ! They 're already aiming the main ... out in the neighborhood . I think the whole thing is ... in the next 24 hours . There 's already ... that indicates ... Okay , what ? Say it again , man . You 're breaking up . Wait , okay . All right , it 's clearing up . Go ahead . I said we just registered a big activity spike near you . The effect triangulation also connects to ... Anderson house . - What ? - The Ander ... house ! ... derson ! What did you say ? Mrs. Anderson wishes you weren 't even around . Aah ! You stay the fuck away from Philip Anderson . Hey , Jacob . Still tearing it up online again , buddy ? Guess so . Plug a couple for me , champ . Baby , I 'm home . Jacob ? No ! No eggs ? No , wait wait . Lately ... lately it 's been bricks just waiting to ... to smash my face in . Okay , now that we 're here , what exactly am I taking pictures of ? Okay . Now I have to ask myself , " Is this really worth it ? " Because ... somebody 's gonna do something really shitty to me today . It 's bound to happen , but I ... I 've got to go to the store . At the very least I 'll get some stares . Yeah , maybe called a name or two . Ah . And then there 's these . That 's ... that 's all I need . Hey , guys , something 's going on with this dude . Gonna play my game . What the hell ? Could be the cancer . I heard he got sick too . You mean sicker . Gah ! So I hear you like to fuck kids . Let me show you how it feels . Aah ! Jesus . What ? I don 't know . - We 'll look later . Keep snapping . - Okay . Play with ... play with ... It 's not real . - Let me show you how it feels . - No , it 's not real . It 's not real . Real ... Real ... Guys , I ... I don 't know what I just saw . It looked pretty weird from where I 'm standing . - Yeah . - And no video . Freakin ' Andy . - You 've got the camera with the video . - Oh yeah . We have got to follow this guy . I have a feeling wherever he goes , shit 's going down . Trace , you coming or you going back to Jennifer 's ? Let 's just do it . No shit . Oh shit . - What 's the speed limit here ? - About 20 , I think . - Are you fucking kidding me ? - Come on , he 's not gonna go far . This sucks . We 've been having a lot of long days here lately . We had quite a number of breakthroughs . It 's gotten everyone really jazzed up . Of course we reimburse for overtime . Word is you 're the guy who 's closest to the cure . That 's what they 're saying , huh ? Oh , that 's what we 're hearing . Well , I must say that I 'm especially intrigued by the new top-secret vaccine you guys have developed . Mm-hmm . I couldn 't dig up any information on it in journals , which is pretty ... it 's pretty rare these days . You get to see everything tomorrow . In the meantime , here we have your credentials , the Facility map , the benefits package . And we activated this and we set it to the pin you requested . Oh , one more thing ... we still need to get you in for a physical ... just a formality . But that reminds me ... I understand you 've been on medication . - Yeah , migraines . - Hmm . - How 'd you know that ? - Our doctors here pulled your history . We just want to make sure we 're all on the same page . Well , I think we 're done here . - Yes ? - Yes . Great . So , Dr. Gray , you mind if I join you and Wayne for drinks tonight ? No , not at all . We 'll probably have a few more friends show up . Hey , the more the merrier . How about you , Louise ? No , thank you . Tomorrow 's the anniversary and I 'm gonna try and stop by my mother 's tonight . Oh , that 's right . I forgot . I 'm sorry about that . Don 't worry about it . You guys have a good time . So what brings you to our quaint little hamlet , Dr. Gray ? Any of your names Jennifer Crusel ? - Mark . - Mark . I take it this is your friend , Dr. Gray ? No , I 've never seen this guy before . What 's up , man ? - Cole , Cole , my ace in the hole . - How are you doing , man ? - Good , man . You 're looking good . - Good . Mark Kincaid , this is Jason and his boyfriend John . Nice to meet you . How long have you guys known each other ? - Um ... - Let 's see ... I don 't know if he 'll ever be ready to hear something like that . So what does that mean for us ? I mean , what kind of future do you think we can have if we 're sneaking around town all the time ? We 'll figure it out . Who cares what they think ? Hey . Ready to switch ? Who cares what they think , right ? Come on . Hey . Hey , hold on . - How far do I get to take the charade ? - What just happened ? You don 't even get to high-five her , bro . How is he gonna believe that I 'm her boyfriend if I don 't give her a goodnight kiss ? - He 's got a point , Mark . - Just a little one . - You two are terrible . - I 'm just messing with you , man . Relax , okay ? I 'll come back here , all right ? All right . You staying over ? Yes , sweetheart , I 'm staying the night . - Well , thank you . - Okay . - You wanna watch some shitty movies ? - No doubt . - Okay , later . - Cool . Thus began our beautiful long-term friendship . Cheers . So who 's this Jennifer Crusel ? And why does her name sound so familiar ? She 's , uh , just this girl . That he 's madly in love with . See ? This is a story that I wanna hear . - Oh , it is . - Do tell , Dr. Gray . Yes , Dr. Gray , do tell indeed . I personally think you should get a tattoo on your forehead that says " fucking chump . " Then every time you look in the mirror ... wha ! Yeah , how many chances are you gonna give this girl ? Dude , I just met you . Definitely more than he gave me . Ah , I guess we 're getting the band back together . Hi , Jesse . Hey , Julie . - Here , wanna sit ? - Yeah . I 'm surprised you weren 't waiting for him at the airport . I heard that you might be coming back for a job at the Facility . You know , gotta wonder why the hell you would ever want to come back here . Boy , you just missed the tail end of a mean conversation . So , Miss Stanton , I 've seen you around a bit . Yeah , well , this is pretty much my beat , but I don 't usually get much work since there isn 't much crime in this area , not until lately . It was kind of weird when the community got annexed . They didn 't fire or demote us ... just kind of reassigned our duties . But we also cover some of the other suburban areas , but it 's pretty slow . Does anybody know anything about the disappearances or any of the other weird stuff going on ? What you got from the captain is par for the course . It 's got the entire department in complete chaos . Speaking of which , Mark here used to be a local cop too . Hey , Mark , why don 't you enlighten us on that subject a little bit ? There isn 't too much to tell , really . - Oh , there 's not ? - No . Wow . Are you flustered ? I 've never heard this story . Yeah well , Cole , isn 't that ... ? 6 : 00 . Aw shit . Hey , kids . - She 's young . - Are you surprised ? - What do you want ? - I haven 't heard from you in a long time . I didn 't even know you were coming to town till today . Yeah . Well , you know , there 's reasons for that . What the hell does that mean ? - Nothing . - Nothing ? So who is it tonight ? Jesus Chri ... is that ... ? He is just a friend . You got a lot of those . Hey , Mark . Check out who she 's with . You 've gotta be kidding me . How long have you been getting Walter over there to pay your bills ? - Fuckin ' leech . - Don 't you talk to me that way ... ever . - Let 's start getting coverage for tomorrow . - Yeah . Are you guys staying ? Yeah , we should wrap this up . Uh , big day tomorrow . - Yeah . - You can do better than that . You make me fuckin ' sick . Bye , guys . I 'm surprised . You didn 't introduce me to your shitty little friends . - I 'm so offended . - Nice . You know what ? I wish I never had you . And sometimes I wish the same thing . We have something in common . What 's going on over here ? Nothing ... nothing at all . Just talking to my son , my loving son . I haven 't spoken to you in , what , a year , is it ? So when 's the last time you saw your daughter , Walter ? Fuck you , you mongrel piece of shit . Punk . - Okay . - Hey , Walter , do you even know her ? - What are you talking about ? - Do you even know her ? - You don 't understand , Cole . - Just sit down . - Don 't touch me . - Marie . You don 't understand . No , you don 't understand . You 're the latest one for her . - Just sit down . - How many different guys was it when I was growing up , Mom ? Because I lost count . - You know what ... you need to just stop it . Don 't talk to her ... Cole , you shouldn 't ... - I shouldn 't talk to her like that ? - She 's your mother . - No , you shouldn 't . - Ask her about the cigarette burns . Ask her about her forcing me to eat out of the trash . You know what ... better yet , let me just show you something . - This is funny shit . - He doesn 't need to see that . You will love this shit . Get the fuck off me ! - This one here ... that 's funny , right there . - Don 't . Don 't . So don 't tell me why I shouldn 't talk to her like that . - Cole , maybe you should calm down . - Yeah , man . - Oh , Cole , your nose . - Whoa , you all right ? I 'm okay . - I just got the worst headache . - Oh , I can see why . I think you two need to go home . I think you need to mind your business . Marie , come on , come on . - Let 's go . Come on . - Sit down . - Do you feel okay to leave ? - Yeah . - Good , you can walk me home . - We can go . Mark . I think I 'm actually gonna catch up with Julie and Jesse , maybe share some info . Yeah , that always seems to work pretty well for you . I 'll catch up with you , Cole . ... assistance to local families stricken by the disease . ... assistance to local families stricken by the disease . If you have questions , see a store associate for details . - Here I am . - What 's up with that though ? You don 't get double time ? - I guess not . - I wouldn 't do that . - No . - No personal leave ? - God , that sucks . - What does he think you are , a robot ? I don 't know , man . Yo , watch this . Oh shit . Can I help you ? Yeah , I 'm looking for the paper goods aisle . Like toilet paper and Kleenex ... that sort of thing ? Yeah . Yes , that sort of thing . Where do I need to go ?

I don 't know what you 're talking about . I didn 't do anything . I just went in there to buy some toilet paper , for Christ 's sake and ... And what ? None of this is real . Don 't you see ?

No way . - I 'm with Tracie on this one . I mean , he could have caused whatever happened in there . - He 's covered in blood . - Whatever happened is still happening . I told you this was bigger than him . Look , come on . We gotta see how this plays out . Look , I don 't know who the fuck you people are ; I don 't know what you want ; all I know is I need to go ! Now ! I need to find help ! You couldn 't pay me enough money to get in with that ... - Ah ! - Get in ! Go go go ! Get in . Shit . ... a series of increasingly bizarre events ... a series of increasingly bizarre events that have been plaguing the community . No , he 's not here yet . No , I don 't want him to . Remember , you said it might jeopardize the plan . I know we 're on the same side . I just think we should let this go . Well , I can 't help that , all right ? But be warned : The following footage may not be suitable for younger viewers . Are you watching this ? No , look , I can 't do that . I think they know . I said I think they know what 's going on . No , I can 't turn my TV down . I think my place is bugged . I mean it 's gotta be somehow . I 'm not being paranoid . I can tell the difference . Look , the guy 's here and tomorrow 's the big ... So everything 's still going according to plan , right ? You know how you 're gonna get in , right ? We 've got to get this information out . No , I told you why I can 't do that . Not like that . I 'll call you back . Federal Bureau of Investigation . How may I help you ? - I need to speak to Agent Park right now . - One moment , please . Hello ? Shit ! John ? John ? John , is that you ? Jason ? Jason , where are you ? Can you hear me ? Jason ! Stop the car ! FBI . God damn it ! How 'd the fuckin ' feds find out about this , Katherine ? We 've been on their watch list ever since we did that stuff with Sea Shepherd last year . - I knew that was a bad idea . - And now we 're being chauffeured by a child predator covered in blood . - Nice . - Shh ! I need you to take me to the Facility . Now ! Uh , yeah yeah , sure . O-okay , yeah . Get in . Okay , guys , we need to move . Looks like they 're going live at the Facility in the next 24 hours . Okay , everyone , listen up . Make sure you check the files on the main subjects . Some of them are interrelated and their aberrations will feed off of those connections . We have at least one subject that is a known felon ... a child predator . Some of the other subjects were chosen strictly based on personality disorders and psychosis . As a result , things might get intense , so be prepared . Once again , the person running the show is Louise Strack . You might remember her from PSYOPS . Her brother , also with the Bureau , was killed in a foreign skirmish five years ago . Since then she 's been hiding underground , possibly driven by revenge . We 've been watching her for a while and we 're relatively certain that she 's been continuing her research where she left off here , which is a very dangerous place to be . I need you guys prepared for the worst . Our main objective is retrieval , not destruction . Keep trying to get in touch with the contacts on the inside . Yes , sir . Access granted . Look at you , bad girl . And how long have you known this guy ? A long time . Come on , let 's go . Some of this stuff ... Wow . Apparently they were breaking ground for a subdivision . - They found something . - What ? Doesn 't really say . It 's actually more disturbing in that it 's so vague . Hey , check this out . " Indeterminate substances and anomalies discovered in tests ... no known matches ... highly toxic . " - Oh my God . - What ? This memo earmarks the land for low-income housing projects . No no no , that jives with what we heard . There are some really strange records over here . Infrasonics , pulsed microwaves , massive carcinogen dispersal ... and then there are some really esoteric subjects . - Like what ? - Karl Wiligut and Sidney Gottlieb are the only names I recognize . Oh , that 's enough for me to know this can 't be good . There 's also some ... Is this Satanic ... No ! You guys need to come with us . What the fuck was that ? Wait . What the hell is he doing here ? ! Jennifer , look , it 's a long story . I 'm still fuzzy on the details , but I think he has - a part in this somehow . - An unwilling part . Webber was specifically chosen by the project for his deviant thought patterns . My head ... it 's really starting to hurt again . He also makes a nice scapegoat to blame all the abductions on . These are hospital records for every person that 's gone missing . All right , that ... stop . What the hell is going on here ? Seriously , I think something bad is gonna happen again . All of the info is in here . Scan it quickly . I know you were planning on sharing it with the public . - How did you know that ? - I know ... I knew your informant . We also had another guy on the inside ... a security guard , but he 's disappeared as well . Look , take this and get it out now . Start spreading the word before the information gets quashed . Getting this out in the public is the only way to make sure something gets done . We can upload it at Philip 's house . That way we can get my mom and dad out as well . Oh , it burns ! It hurts , oh ! - It burns ! - Wait ! I don 't care what I just saw or what happened , I 'm not going anywhere with this scumbag . - Look , you don 't know what he did . - I know exactly what he did . That 's why he 's here . Hey . Hey ! Hey , what the fuck is wrong with him ? Nothing 's wrong . Nothing at all . Oh no ! No no ! Oh no ! Get down . No ! No ! - Why ? - Get down . - Get out of here ! Go ! - No , shoot him ! Is she gone ? Hello ? Strack ? Yeah , it 's me . I 'm at home . Why ? Shit . Whoa . Okay . What the hell was that for ? - I knew it . - Knew what ? - That he 's the cause somehow . - Somewhat . But he isn 't the only one with the talent or whatever you wanna call it . Most are out there , but the others here , the abductees , they serve to boost the effect . What ? I don 't follow . We don 't have time right now . Jennifer , find the map . I need to get to the center of the Facility . - What 's in the center ? - The amplifiers , for lack of a better word . Okay , we need to go here . - You guys are safer if you stay with me . - Mom ? - L ... I have to go home . - What ? - Wait , let me see that . Let me see that . - L ... I have to leave . - Shit shit . - I have to go home . Okay , Philip , Philip , Philip . Look , calm down , okay ? Calm down . Philip , listen to me . As far as I can tell , everything out there is relatively sane . Listen to me , okay ? I know I 'm not gonna be able to stop you short of shooting you , but you need to understand some things first so you and Katherine can take this information and share it with everyone , okay ? - Okay . O-okay . - Good . Here 's the short version as I understand it . Somehow certain people ... the ones on the list including your mother ... they developed a rare neurological condition . It says cancer here . Probably from the shit they dug up , which according to this could be anything from industrial waste , concentrated evil , extraterrestrial material and everything in-between . Jason said they called it cancer because they ruled out everything else . This was something new . It manifested itself in different ways ... seizures , tumors , migraines . Eventually they figured it wasn 't destroying the brain ; - it was rewiring it somehow . - Who 's they ? Who do you think ? We 've seen next to no one around here . We got word that something big was supposed to happen this week . We know that there 's a skeleton crew here , but everyone else is off site . I 'm beginning to understand why . So what is this doing to my mom ? Simply put : Anyone with this condition ... Do you know what psychokinesis is ? Yeah , it 's the shit I read about in comic books . Not anymore . Apparently these people can control things down to the molecular level . Well , what about the ghost stories , the fire ... all that ? Every experiment has to have a control to eliminate certain conclusions . They fed that story to the community to try and induce a specific measurable result . A sort of feed-off - of-the-group thing . Isn 't that a bit much ? Obviously they can 't alert everyone to what 's going on . And sometimes the best stories are the ones with a kernel of truth in them . So they really did burn down the entire neighborhood . The neighborhood and everyone in it . Jesus . We 're not sure if they came up with the idea first or if it grew out of the plan to take back the area . Either way , one fed into the other . All right , here 's the exit . Keep out of sight and run straight to your house . We 'll try and catch up with you later . Most importantly , - you need to get that stuff on the web . - Okay . Keep in mind that these constructs are created by human minds , so the usual deterrents will work ... a head trauma , blinding light . Let 's go . - Something 's here . - No . There 's ... there 's absolutely nothing here . Look around . No , this isn 't the truth . I know . L ... I can feel the differences . It 's so much easier . He 's right . This is supposed to be where they keep the main amplifiers . You keep saying that . What the hell are you talking about ? According to the info we gathered , the neurological aberration manifests itself in two ways . Think of it like an electric guitar . There are instruments ... we call them pushers ... of which there are several throughout the neighborhood . Then there are those who serve as a conduit to the pushers . Like an amplifier , they help the pusher think louder . It also makes the effect cover a larger area . - So Cadence and the other abductees ... - Act as amplifiers , yes . They can do a small amount of pushing on their own . But you don 't want your linebacker throwing the ball . And you don 't want your quarterback on defense . Though there are some of those with the affliction that can do a little of both . - So you 're saying they 're in here ? - They 're supposed to be , yes . They must have moved them , or it 's a fake out . They 're here . It 's so much easier . I can just unfold . It 's not just about us , you know ? There 's something about this place , something underground that 's ... it 's still a part of this . Please don 't mention Indians or burial grounds . No , that 's not ... no , there 's something else . Someone 's coming through that door . - What the fuck 's going on ? - Mark , it 's okay . Calm down . For real ? Shit . So what do you know ? Something 's pushing . - It 's getting stronger ! - What 's going on ? What the fuck is he doing here ? She 's hiding them all from us . She 's a little self-conscious , it seems . She ? Now that we 're all here ... activate everyone . We 're starting the experiment early . You heard her . Start the pulse and activate the post-hypnotic fail safes . Copy that . Starting pulse . - Aah ! - Aah ! We wouldn 't normally go this fast , so I 'm sure it hurts . What did you just do ? Oh , we had to move our timetable a little ahead . What are you doing in this lab ? You 've got it all wrong . This isn 't the lab . The lab 's out there ... the whole neighborhood . Where 's Cadence ? Tell me or I 'll blow your fuckin ' head off . She 's right here , Mark , with all of the other amplifiers . They 've become very strong . Any shot you take runs the risk of hitting her . - No you don 't ! - Mark . Mark , you don 't understand . She 's beyond help . This is the only way . Doing this won 't bring your brother back . Maybe not , but it 'll sure make the wars a lot more interesting . I 'm so sorry , Cole , but your girlfriend over there jumped the gun a little . She thinks you 're his girlfriend . All you did was fuck ! Aah ! Barry ! Aah ! Aah ! Jesus Christ ! See ? That was definitely interesting . Of course we 're gonna have to discuss what happens with that footage . - We 're not faking this time . - So the media knew all along ? Word of mouth only goes so far . They even helped us set up our scapegoat . We didn 't know . We thought that you were helping Cole . We didn 't know either fucking way ! Migraines . Medication . Your fractured psyche was precisely what we 've been searching for . After all , thoughts are energy and energy doesn 't disappear . It just changes form . Exactly , Dr. Gray . You ... you were tailor-made for this . Your intellect gives you better focus . It makes you capable of both pushing and transmitting . It took us pointing all 12 of our amps to take out Freese and William . - But with you ... - If I 'm as powerful as you say , what 's to stop me from pointing this at you ? And then him ? No ! Watch it , Cole . - Philip . - Dad ? - Is something wrong ? - Oh no , son . Your mother and I are just taking care of a few things inside . Come on in . It 's getting late . Honey , Philip 's back . Dad , what 's going on here ? Where 's Katherine ? Son , there are some things we need to discuss with you . We know what 's going on with you and Katherine . - What ? - Your mother and I , we ... you know , actually she should be in here for this . - Honey ? - I don 't understand . You guys are gonna have to come in here . I can 't seem to figure this out . All right , then . Let 's go talk to her . I might need you to help me over here . - What ? - I 'm having the worst luck . What 's wrong with you ? Calm down , Phil . You 've hurt your mother 's feelings enough lately . You 're different ever since she came around . We understand . We know what happened and why you 've been so distant . What ? We wanted to help you with your problem , honey , figure it out together like the old days . I just can 't seem to find the baby . Oh my God , she 's not pregnant . We 've never even slept together . It 's okay , son . You can tell us the truth . We love you . We really do love you , Philip . It 's for the best . Maybe you should look higher up , honey . Philip , you get back here . It 's okay . Give him time . He 's just not himself . Now ... now , come here and help me . Now grab hold of that and pull . I love you . I love you too . - Ready ? - Yeah . This happened already . Cadence . She 's here all right . But that 's not her . That 's just who and where she wants to be . Look over here . The conduits , amplifiers ... whatever . None of this is real . It seems real enough to me . Wait . Something 's happening . Yeah , she 's pushing . And he might be too . And then the amplifiers are helping . - Where 'd they go ? - They 're already here . We just have to catch up to them . You see ? Cadence . You can 't . - Did this already happen ? - Yeah . They must be projecting shared memories . It has to be some form of mental shock from the strain . You know this will never work . So how long have you known the truth ? - Who 's that ? - That is her dad . Roger saw you and that half-breed out at the movies last month . I made the rest on my own . We didn 't really get along . You know there 's nothing you can do about this , Dad . All I really can do at this point , honey , is to try to talk some sense into you . - Your condition ... - It 's not about my condition . That 's just an easy excuse for you . - Please . - I can 't do this right now . Honey , you need to listen to me . No ! What ? Neil Holloway , please pick up the nearest white courtesy phone . Neil Holloway , please pick up a white courtesy phone . Hmm , she seems to be giving off different patterns . They 're stronger , but less focused . It 's like gross motor skills versus fine motor skills . I 'm thinking she may be able to augment some of our more precision-based subjects . We 've got to get her back to the Facility for testing as soon as possible . You don 't want me to see her anymore . I guess you knew I was gonna say that . We 've ... we 've done this before . But this is the last time . She cannot have any distractions . These people are gonna help her . Mark , if you really love her ... if you really love her , you 'll walk away now . They are not gonna help her ! Cole ? Dr. Lance , please report to the ICU . Dr. Lance to the ICU . Cole should be okay . But we did notice some abnormal brain activity that you might want to bring him back in for . - Could be the cause of his depression . - Just ... you know what ? How much is all this shit gonna cost me ? We 'll bill you . Mommy ? Do you know what your father would have done to me if you had killed yourself ? The biggest mistake I ever made was not leaving you with him . Listen to me . Next time , you do it right . You probably shouldn 't be doing that . I know . I can 't help it . Yeah yeah , I kind of understand . - You do ? - Yeah . Look , I 'll tell you what ... you can come over to my place anytime you want . We can hang out , talk , play games , just have fun ... the two of us . How about that ? Aah ! You knew I was vulnerable . You piece of shit . Sor ... sorry . L ... There 'll never be enough sorries . Do it , baby . Kill him . Holy shit . And then we can fuck . I 'll still be warm for at least another half-hour . I may even let you put it in my new hole . Mm . Cole , is ... is that you or him doing that ? To tell you the truth , I don 't know . It 's Cole . Help me ! Help ! What 's your ETA ? Things are getting extremely crazy around here . Affirmative ! They 've evacuated all the subjects , and from what I can tell the receivers are still active as well . The effect radius covers the entire neighborhood . 10-4 . I 'll meet you at the rendezvous point . Cadence , is that you ? Yes ... and no . It 's a long story . No ! Actually that 's what has to happen , Mark . We can 't think ourselves out of existence . Who do you think made you bring that ? We 're like an antenna and I 'm at the top of the tower . You can do it if you prefer ... kill us , I mean . How many ... what did she call them ? Pushers . They push reality . How many pushers are there throughout the neighborhood ? About 50 , all with varying degrees of mental instability . I guess the most volatile minds give the most interesting results . Especially if you 're thinking in terms of weaponry . What has to happen ? Once we 're ... turned off , the effects will become more localized and more easily contained . What about Strack and everyone else at the Facility ? They 're watching and recording from a base station not far from here . Never get in the cage with the animals . Now what ? Cole , I can fully activate you and take you to the next level so you can put a stop to this . I can alter your brain to put you further along . I don 't know what that kind of leap might do to you . It took them over a year to do it to me . It can 't get any worse . There . Good luck . Mark , it 's time . I 'm staying with her . Pull the pin and throw it in when you leave . Mark , are you sure ? Yeah . I think . Yeah . I really want to . We need to go ! Cole . I really am so sorry . I know . - What the ... ? - She was right ... it 's much easier now . Cole ? - Are you okay ? - Not really , no . We need to get to the front of the community . - That 's the rendezvous point . - Everyone 's been switched off . The effect should dissipate without the thought battery or whatever that was . We just need to stay alert , steer clear of people . Right . Come on , let 's go . We just lost most of the sub-basement level . It 's negligible . The effects will begin to taper off , but they 'll last a good half-hour . The video we 're receiving is exactly in line with the dummy story . Oh , we did an excellent job of saturating the media . These readings are off the charts . I still can 't believe what we found in Dr. Gray 's file . Oh , I know . Speaking of which , where 's our consultant on that ? I 'm right here . Ah , Miss Gray . Stay close by . We may need you to catalyze a response . Henry , prepare procedures for containment . Affirmative . Wait a minute . Have you seen ... did you see Julie or Jesse ? I think they got pulled through the wall . No , they 're here . I 'll go see if they 're okay . You guys just stay here . Don 't take too long . We need to move . Jules ? Jess ? Julie ? Jess ? What ? Can 't a brother and sister take a bath together ? Oh my God . You know we 've always been close . Very close . You could never stand it , could you ? 'Cause we had everything that you didn 't . You 're doing this and you don 't even know it . You can 't just shut off your subconscious , Cole . No . Don 't you see ? This is why they chose you . This is your idea of love . Aah ! Hey , John , maybe you should just knock me out . John , look out ! Enjoy the lake of fire , Sodomite . Aah ! Come on , we have to go . Now what ? - I think the effect 's wearing off . - Yeah ? But what about the people in control ? I haven 't forgotten them . I think he 's made our location . Send her in . Cole . You 've got to stop . Now you want to show concern ? It 's about 20 years too late for that . Look , I was trying to talk to you in the bar , but you wouldn 't talk to me . I was going to tell you everything that 's going on here . Cole , she 's lying . Am I really , Lisa ? Why don 't you ask her involvement in this ? What do you think it would take for her to get back on top after Marky boy fucked her over ? - Lisa ? - Think about this , Cole . She 's been lying to you your entire life . She 's working for them . This is just another way to pull your strings . Cole . I am sorry for how things were when you were growing up . I really am . I mean I was young . I was stupid . I didn 't know how to make decisions . You know none of that is a good excuse , right ? I do . But I swear to you it 's all gonna be better now . I promise . Come to me . Cole , don 't do it . Cole . Perfect . They always want the same thing . Prepare to move in and wrap this one up , gentlemen . I love you . Aah ! - Was that supposed to happen ? - No , you idiot ! Initiate the neutralizer pulse ! I had no idea . All men , prepare for entry into the hot zone . Stanton , are you okay ? Yeah . John didn 't make it though . So you were working for them . She was working with us to ensure your safety , Dr. Gray . We 'd like to keep you alive and well and offer you a position with the Bureau . As what ? A mental assassin ? You 're missing the bigger picture . - You can harness this . - Do you understand , Dr. Gray ? This goes beyond basic telekinesis . Make sure you get core samples . Can you imagine walking into a battlefield and ... I don 't know , turning the weapons to musical instruments ? Or going to a drought-ridden village and bringing water to the surface ? This is what we 're talking about . Doesn 't that kind of make me a god ? Arguably , by standard definitions , yes . I don 't wanna be a god . What do you want then ? When questioned about the rampant vegetation growth surrounding the human remains , university botanists seemed baffled , only going on record to say that the plants appear to be a never-before-seen invasive species . Further scientific study is expected to resume once the authorities have completed their investigation . And in breaking news tragedy struck the enclave community just north of Cooperman 's Creek last night . Isn 't that your home town ? Yeah . It 's a good thing you didn 't take that job . - The cause is yet to be determined . - I know . Local , state and , we are told , federal authorities are working together to prepare a full official statement for release later today . - Sources also tell ... - What time do we need to leave ? ... a terrorist attack has yet to be ruled out . - Like an hour . - I 'll go get ready . - Some viewers may remember the area as the former 11th ward district that was razed to the ground by a cataclysmic fire several years ago . It was the worst disaster the state has ever seen , possibly until now . We go now to a field report from our sister station Channel 17 and their correspondent Amanda Saxon who has further details . Sources say that the relative proximity and walkable nature of the neighborhood increased the damage tenfold . The handful of survivors remember nothing about the tragedy . Authorities speculate that an explosion at the Facility sparked a chain reaction that ignited gas mains beneath the streets . Among the 100 still missing are FBI Agent Wayne Park , FBI liaison Lisa Stanton , Officer Mark Kincaid and Channel 17 's own Julie and Jesse Dylan . This is Amanda Saxon re ...

 completely blocked by the haze , and it does appear to be getting worse and ... continues to spew ash and smoke into the sky . Authorities are trying to get through to the affected areas , but ... breaking news that a major volcanic eruption has gone off within the Oregon ... still several miles away , but you can see the ash is now spewing upward with great ferocity . Now , we can only imagine what it 's like for those who are actually close to ... One witness tells us ... The eruption itself is still several miles away , but you Once again , we can tell you Here are the first images from central Oregon . Again , a major volcanic eruption has rocked the In fact , the sun now is being completely blocked by the haze . All of this has become the focus of rescue efforts throughout the area We 're getting reports that federal authorities are working from Paxton , which remains out off but , at this time , there 's little that can be done but to wait for Mother Nature to take its course . We need a list of who was at the well . Their families are going to start calling . We need to know who they are . Yes , sir . Now we are getting reports that the entire town of Maple Grove has been completely destroyed . Now , a helicopter pilot we spoke to says he 's seen more than just this eruption . In fact , several eruptions through the caldera How old 's your boy ? He 's nine . Does he live with you ? No , I , I lost custody . His father 's a very good lawyer . He 's also a jerk . I 'm sorry to hear that . Are we going to make it out of this ? I don 't know . Well , isn 't this one of those situations when you 're supposed to lie ? Well , I 've never really been in one of those situations , so ... Matthew ? Matthew ! Hold it , hold it ! Let 's go . Go ! Go ! Come through , come through ! That 's it ! Keep going , keep going , keep going ! Sheriff , I 'm going to need a power genny and a satellite uplink to Caltech USGS and the Emergency Response Association . I 'm also going to need you to liaise with Health Services . We 've got to make sure we can get these victims taken care of . The hospital is down , sir . Backup generator is gone as well . Okay , see if you can get your guys to ID and secure a triage . Get all available health supplies you can . - We 're going to need them . - Yes , sir . Hey . You okay ? Yeah . Yeah . What the hell was that ? I 'm fine ... I 'm fine . Look , we can 't keep breathing this stuff . We have to move on . All right , we 're going to have to break through that . Are you ready ? Let 's go . Come on , come on ... Everybody , I know you 're scared , but it 's going to be okay . Dylan and Paul ? Reach up and make sure the windows are shut tight . Andrea , I need you to check all the backpacks for food and water , okay ? Okay Put any blankets or jackets on the floor to cover the windows . Watch out for the glass . I can 't find my jacket . Is anyone else hurt ? Oh , I 've got a jacket . Here 's my jacket . There 's supposed to be oxygen tanks here . They never restocked after we started up again . How much air do we have left ? A few hours , tops . Not quite so normal now , is it , Hector ? How many others ? Including us ? But you still have your job , don 't you ? You still have that ! Hey , come on ! You still have that ! Guys ! Guys ! Relax ! Made the 911 call before the communications were knocked out . But even if they find us , there 's no way they can get to us ! Is there ? Finished . We have to keep that area clear . Mr. Stromwall ? Audrey Lee . We spoke on the phone . Audrey . You have the data ? Yeah , it 's right here . Let 's have a look . This is the latest from our satellites . Our own sensors are still giving us a pretty good idea of where the activity is centered . We 're right here , and the epicenter is right here , about 20 miles . The well site is right here . Okay , what 's the distance ? Approximately halfway between us and the epicenter . Now , when they punctured the magma , they pressurized four of the chambers , which we 've identified , and this was the first to go . There 's going to be more . So , what about this ? I think the lava has been expelled from the drill site itself , so we 're seeing lots of steam . It 's also trying to get out through other natural vents , but , God , there 's so much ash in the air that we 're losing our imaging . Okay , the DOD is moving a thermal satellite into position as we speak . It 's going to give us a better set of eyes . Yeah . We need you to upload this data to our equipment , ASAP . Yeah . Barbara Zimmerman , CalTech . Glad you made it through . Are you still linked up with California ? They 're feeding us live data . We 've got new satellite imagery coming in as well . Hold on . It 's showing a new event . Depth of 15,400 meters . Registering at 3.7 . Looks like another eruption . That 's sizable . Seven miles from the original event . What 's the population out there ? It 's sparse . It 's a mostly rural area . Ana . What do you want ? I want to know if Hector 's okay . You 're not welcome here , Samuel . - I know ... - I 'm sorry . I know , I know , I 'm just worried about Hector . Was he at the well ? Just leave . You can 't stay here . They 're evacuating the town . I am not leaving Paxton until he comes home . And I 'm asking you one more time , Samuel . Please , just leave . There 's a walkway right here , it 's mostly contained , that branches off from that vent right up there . No . No , that vent is sealed . It 's sealed at the back , where it connects to the internal air ducts . 20 feet in from there , it branches off , takes us to the walkway , right here . Where does that take us ? The walkway will take us to the upper complex . But that 's ... there 's no outside access here . We 'd be trapped the same as we are here . No , from the upper complex , there 's a ventilation shaft ... right here ... take us right into the mines . That is , if the mines are still intact . Well , that 's a big assumption . Look , it 's either that or we stay here and suffocate . And what if the upper complex is contaminated with that ? We die quicker . Just take a sip of water and pass it on , but just one . We have to conserve it . - Thanks . - Here . Now , I know I said no cell phones , - but did any of you bring one ' ? - No . I promise you won 't get in trouble . No . My god . What the hell is that ? Switch to wider . This is no longer contained . The Ring of Fire is active . The whole damn world 's about to catch fire . You 've reached Emily Booth with All Earth Foundation . Please leave me a message . Emily , it 's me . This is the only number I have for you . I need to know that you 're okay . And Dylan ? If you don 't want to call me , call my office . Oliver , we 've got to get to the airport . The G5 jet is on its way . Lawyers are waiting for us in Atlanta . Well , they can wait . We have got some serious damage control to do . - It cannot wait ... - Damage control ? The damage is done . The damage out there . Well , I know that , Oliver , but we 've got to get prepared for this . My daughter and my grandson are out there . Look , the roads are jammed . The G5 is the only way out . They are not going to take off without you . You are putting our lives at risk if you will not leave now . Do your damage control , I 'll do mine . Oliver ! Hold that . Hold that , hold the light . I can 't do this . There 's no way . I can 't do this . There 's not a lot of other options . No , I don 't ... I 'm claustrophobic . And not just a little . What ? Well , what you 're going to be is dead , Glen , if you stay here . Come on , this is the only way out ... I can 't do this . Yes , you can . It 's gonna be all right . Just imagine , like , a beach , or a lake or something ... Oh , Montana . Montana ? Yeah . Lot of open spaces . Come on , let 's go . Come on , you can do this . Get in . You can do it , man . Reports now that the second eruption was part of a larger extended eruption , experts saying there could be more . But in fact this entire ... They won 't let anyone through . They just said on the news they 're calling in the National Guard . You think they 're gonna make our boys up there a priority ' ? They 'll leave them up there to die . Look , Chris , I just overheard the guys in the tent say there 's no one alive within five miles of that well . The whole area went up . There was a 911 distress from the well after the eruption . I worked construction on that rig . This is the well head . This is the operations room . It can be sealed off . It 's built to withstand a nuclear blast . It doesn 't matter , there 's no way to even get close to that well . This is the third part here , we called it " the upper complex , " the guts of the rig . There 's a five-mile lateral ventilation tunnel that goes outward from the upper complex . There 's at least three or four entry points . That 's how we get to them . Look , Chris , the whole place is a furnace . Even getting to these access points is impossible . You don 't have to . Just hear me out ... I don 't need to listen to a damn word you say ... Well , you 're going to listen , Chris , because I 'm going to go find my brother . I 'm going to get him out , and I can 't do it by myself . We can access the upper complex through the mines . I know I 'll never pay enough for what I did , but I know these mines . I know them . I can trace them , I know where they start , where they stop ... They used to use them as natural ventilation , right up into the guts of the rig . Hector 's boy was my godson . And he was my nephew . I loved him . I can 't bring him back . The least you could do is just help me bring Hector home . Okay ? Why are they just sitting here like this ? It 's gas . Before the eruption . C02 at those levels would kill you almost instantly . They had no chance . Hey . I know . We 'll bring it back . Let 's go . My God , look at all of these people . Where are they all going to go ? I don 't know . Right now you should be worried . about finding your son If it 's this bad out here , can you imagine how bad it is in town ? I 've got to get back to the command center , see if there 's any news on USGS or CalTech . - Everybody go to the side . - Let 's go . Let 's go . You saved my life out there . Thank you . Go find your son . Okay We can 't stop here . I have to , man . It 's poison , isn 't it ? You know , my nose still hurts , man . Good . You were wrong about something . Yeah ? You never called me " Hank the Tank " in high-school . Frank Rinelli did . He was going to kick my ass . You threatened to kick his . I don 't remember that . I do . Audrey . Matthew . - Are you okay ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . You scared me . Dr. Cooper ? Harry Stromwall . - Welcome . - Thank you . So , what can you tell us from the ground ? Well , there 's a lot of venting , more than I 've ever seen . Mostly C02 , but there 's a lot more that wants to get out . Are we getting anything from our thermal satellite readings ? Yes , unfortunately , the lava field is continuing to grow , larger than any initial measurements showed . It 's actually expanding . Paxton is now well within its perimeter . We 're also getting reports of seismic activity up and down the Western seaboard . Dylan ? Todd ... Todd ! Where 's Dylan ' ? He 's not with you ? No , he was on a field trip . Yeah , I know . They 're not back . They didn 't come back . I just assumed that you had taken him somewhere else instead . We 've all been waiting here . Nobody has told us anything . It 's okay . It 's okay , it 's okay ... A third eruption , less than six miles . Hang on ! Move your vehicle . Now . Let 's go ! From our office in California . It 's somewhat crude , but between the satellite thermal imagery and our own substrate sensors , it 's given us a better look . It 's looking for another way out , and we 're it . So , how long have we got ? This was four hours ago . The increase in lava elevation has been consistent . I 'm guessing 24 hours . How accurate is that ? This technology is light years ahead of anything we 've ever had . It 's going to be pretty close . Yeah ? Thank you . They just shut down Route 15 . 15 's the only way in or out . Every other road leads to the epicenter of those eruptions . Miss Preston ? Yes , Dylan ? Dylan ! why didn 't you say anything ? My mom gave it to me , and I didn 't want her to get into any more trouble . She 's not going to get in trouble , sweetheart . Come on . Come on . Emily ... The bus driver called in right after the eruption . They had just left Rec Park . We have to do something . There 's nothing we can do . I can 't just sit here . Emily ... The air is toxic . The roads are closed , and we don 't even know where he is . Now , if they 're mobile , they 're on their way . And all information is going to come. through here Okay Okay Who 's that ? - What ? - I can 't ... Keep going forward . I can 't do this ! - Take a breath , Glen . - Come on , man , keep moving . I can 't do this , I can 't do this ... - Keep going ! - Keep moving ! I gotta get outta here . Keep going . We 've gotta go ! I 've gotta get out of here now ! I 've gotta get out of here now ! - Glen ! - I 've gotta get out of here now ! I 've gotta get out of here now ! Glen , no . Glen ! Glen ! Look at me ! Stop , stop ! Look at me ! Hey , hey , stop it . Stop ! Stop ! Stop . Look at me . Calm down ... Calm down . Calm down . Your girlfriend 's waiting for you , Glen . Your family , they 're all waiting for you outside . Now , take it easy . Calm down . Look at me , look at me . Keep it together . Calm down . Okay ? Okay ? Okay ? Calm down ... Calm down . Okay , wait here . Wait here . Stay there . I 'm going to give you some room . That 's it . Come on , buddy . Keep going . So , each increase on CalTech 's crystal ball , and there 's increased activity from Yellowstone to the Aleutians . We 're getting a chain reaction throughout the entire network . Can you use the same prediction model ? Not as precise . We just don 't have feeds into all those areas . I 've sent this information to CalTech . They have a broader range . Can you bring it up for us ? Yeah . These increases along the Ring of Fire , are they at the same trajectory ? So far . If you ask me , if the one we 're sitting on goes , so goes the rest of the world . Our imaging shows the same increase from Yellowstone into the Aleutians . It doesn 't appear to be stopping at just one . Agree . The Ring of Fire is moving toward sizable activity . Then we are in fact facing an Extinction Level Event . So , how the hell do we stop it ' ? Doc , what are you thinking ? She has asthma . Do you have your inhaler ? Just hang on . See you now . Audrey , bring up our data on the Miyakejima event . All right , Guys What we have here ... well , what mother nature has here ... is a very sophisticated network of caves and tunnels , very much like veins and arteries . And in these arteries is molten rock , where the pressure is constantly increasing . Now , our magma chamber was punctured here , and that relieved some of the pressure , resulting in the eruptions we saw here , here and here . Unfortunately , as CalTech has informed us , that pressure is still building . It is now pushing the magma upward . So we need to cap it ? No , we 'd risk collapsing the magma chamber onto itself , and that would only increase combustion . Okay , the Miyakejima event in Japan . Now , at first , it was only a phreatic explosion , only lasted a few minutes . But down below , the magma intrusion was broadening and the pressure was increasing quite dramatically until , all of a sudden , a fissure opened up with the chamber and created a type of thermal drain all the way to the ocean . Now , obviously there were several undersea eruptions and explosions , but , eventually , that magma cooled , and we avoided a pretty catastrophic event . So , what if , in our scenario , we were able to create a similar type fissure ? I mean , there 's a chance we could divert all of this liquid magma away from our chamber . I mean , literally like pulling the plug on a bathtub . - To the ocean ? - Yeah . Doc , Miyakejima was a massive seismic occurrence . How can you possibly expect to duplicate that ? Well , we 'd obviously have to use some type of explosive , right ? Okay , but you 're going to have a very limited outward burst with any kind of incendiary bomb that far underground . - What about a sonic bomb ? - Come again ? I know the military used them under the mountains of Afghanistan . Look , rock is a great amplifier . In essence , what we 'd be doing is creating a massive sonic boom and letting that shock wave travel through the rock as far as it can . In Afghanistan , these things toppled caves and tunnels that were miles away from the detonation point . So , if we could pick the right target , at the right depth , I mean , there 's a chance we could create our own chain reaction , opening fissures all along the way , and giving our magma a free run to the Pacific . Okay , and exactly how do you expect to deliver your sonic bomb to the right fissure ? Call Trans Nova back over here and have them drill another hole ? We don 't have to . The pit crater back at the farm . Here . Thermal readings have shown that there 's an entry point into a fissure . This is the one we want . Now , obviously , we 'd have to use some sort of time-delay detonation , encase it in something that could withstand that kind of heat . Titanium ? Titanium could work . But it would be impossible to identify the entry point from the surface . Right , not to mention that we 're talking about a pretty damn small target here . We can 't just drop this in . No , well , we 'd have to get close . In that kind of heat ? Emily . My God . What happened to you ? I 'm fine . Dylan is still out there . His phone has one of those GPS trackers on it , but my internet 's down . Are you online ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm tweeting live . I 've got the networks on the hook . What 's the number ? You know , if there 's no signal , you 're not going to be able to track it . Sorry . You should do the interview , Em . What ? Well , you know exactly what happened up there . It 's your story . This is a major victory for us , Em . People are trapped out there , Peter . People are dying . That 's-that 's our only priority right now . And I know that . But if we don 't get the truth out there right now , their spin machine is going to smother us . This is their final nail . This is exactly what needed to happen . You were right . Okay , so what if we rig a cable , use a hydraulic winch to maneuver it . No , we 'd be blind . I mean , the only way we can really ensure we 're going to hit that target with any kind of precision is if someone 's right on top of it . But in what ? That heat 's going to be unbearable . The equivalent to what a shuttle goes through on re-entry . Maybe the space program can help us . Wait a minute . You ever heard of the Titan Project ? No . It was originally designed as a manned capsule to be the first Venus lander . They scrapped the project 10 years ago . The technology to make it practical was still too far off , but the capsule itself , that was built . Now , it was sized for one astronaut , and it was built , in fact , to withstand the rigors of re-entry . Now , we might have to piece-meal it , but I think we could probably convert the instrumentation to our needs . Maybe tweak a few of the controls to be able to release the bomb . Wait , wait . Why does someone have to be in it ? Why can 't it be done remotely ? Well , we don 't really have the time to build that kind of technology , and like I said before , you know , the only way to make sure we really hit that target on the nose is if someone 's right on top of it . Otherwise that sonic blast won 't do any good . So , who draws the short straw ? No way . No way , I don 't care how strong that thing is . It 's suicide ... Look , Audrey , if we don 't stop this thing ... No , I don 't care . There 's got to be other options on the table ... There are no other options . This is the table . This is our only option . We 're running out of time , okay ? Harry , if they still have this thing , make a phone call . Let 's get this started . Okay The town of Paxton is reported to be completely cut off , and authorities are trying to break through to evacuate remaining citizens They can confirm that there has been widespread destruction of property and lives from volcanic eruptions in the caldera that surrounds Paxton . You 've reached Emily Booth with All Earth Foundation . Please leave me a message . Make sure you tell those engineers they 're going to have to rig a hell of a counter balance on that crane . They 're already on it . Paul ! Get Reed on the horn ! Tell him the arrival 's going to have to come in from the Northeast . Those choppers won 't get close from any other direction . They 're going to have to coordinate directly with the Corp of Engineers . So , where 's Washington on this ? They 're deferring to us at the moment . They 're briefing the President as we speak . USGS is trying to coordinate with National Guard operations , but they haven 't been able to get through . How long until we get delivery ? They 're still fitting it to our specs . They said by noon tomorrow if they can get the choppers through . Not till noon ? You need to go home and get some sleep . We have a hell of a day tomorrow . There 's a lot of people working round the clock to get this thing ready for you . Sleep . Take him home . Hold on , one sec . One second ... What do we got ? An access point . This should be it . Up here . Are we lost ? This is it , or is this it ? No , should be here , just up here . Yeah , it doesn 't smell right . It 's not right . It 's contaminated . We don 't have much time . Just keep moving . Are you okay ? Yeah . Must be weird to be back here . Doesn 't matter what I think or feel . This is all about Hector . You good ? Yeah , good . Try the other side . Sometimes , you can only get a signal in one tiny little spot . In my bedroom , it 's on the floor , right by the bed . That 's weird ? I wanna go home . I don 't want to be here anymore . I want my morn . I know , it 's okay . So do I. We 're going home really soon , There 's no signal . Sorry . The door was open . - Power 's out . - Yeah . I came to find you . I was trying to track my son down on his cell phone . It 's okay . Anything ? No . I 'm sorry . Is it operable ? You want a drink ? Why don 't you want to talk about it ? Why do I have to talk about it ? Because maybe people care . This way , it 's not real , right ' ? You don 't have to face it . You always think you 're going to have more time , and ... then you realize you won 't . It 's okay to be afraid . It 's okay to be afraid , Matthew . Hey . There we go . - Is that it ? - This is it , this is it . We got it . We 're out . Good work , man . I trusted you . It was a test . Good job , man . What happened ? What 's going on ? He 's bleeding . He 's bleeding ... Okay , come on . What 's happened ? Did you get out ? Oh , God ... Oh , God ... Come here . That 's okay . Keep a hand on it . Help him out , all right ? Ready ? Let 's go ! Okay , let 's go , let 's go . Come on . Come on ... I know he 's out there . I know he 's alive . Well , he has your blood , which means he 's tenacious and unrelenting . He 'll be all right . My grandfather gave me this rock when I was a kid . The very first rock he ever gave me . I want you to give it to Dylan when you see him again . And tell him there 's a story there , that it 's not just some stupid rock , okay ? Okay Hey , earlier , when you broke into my house , you said that you came to see me . Why ? The chances tomorrow aren 't very good , are they ? No . That 's why I came . Let 's go . Keep it up . Keep at it . We 're almost there . Keep going . Sorry . Keep coming . We made it . We made it . We 're actually going to get out of here . - Right , Hector ? - The vent , it 's right over here . The vent 's here . Let 's get him settled down . Yeah , yeah , let 's go , buddy . Just a little further . We 've got to find a way to open this . Okay All right . All right . I 'll take off my belt . All right ... Okay , you 've got to keep breathing . You 've got to keep breathing . Ed , breathe , man ! Breathe , man ! I gotta see this . I gotta unplug the hole . Do you know where we are ? We 're not far from the perimeter of the plant . Which way ? This way . Hey , men ! I 'm going to put some pressure on this . At the count of three . One , two , three . Okay , that 's it . What was that about Montana ? What was that you said ? Think about it . Think about Montana , man . We 're almost there . It 's just down here . We 're almost out of here , buddy . There 's gotta be another way around , right ? The only other access is 10 miles the other way . That 's going to take us all night . Then it takes us all night . Hector ? What 's going on ? Look out ! What 's wrong ? It 's solid steel . It 's all rusted shut . I can 't open it . I wish we had more time . I would have liked that . Me too . Good luck , Dr. Cooper . You , too , Ms. Booth . There 's gotta be another way out of here ? No . That 's the only ventilation shaft that leads into the mines . The rest are all sealed off . What do we do then ? We wait . I can 't ... I can 't hardly ... I can 't breathe . Someone will come . Someone will come . Just stay awake . Stay awake , man . Stay awake . Just got to keep breathing , man . Tango Unit ... Excuse me . I 'm a registered nurse . Thank you . I 'll get you over there . We 're waiting for some supplies , so you 'll have to make do in the meantime . Sergeant ... Has there been any news of any survivors at the well ? Nobody 's been able to get near that area . Go again . Pass me the bag ? Here 's alight . Coming through ! Coming through , please . Hey , excuse me . I 'm looking for a woman named Emily Booth . Sorry , sir ... But you can check with the registrar , just down this way Thanks . Sorry , I don 't want to bother you , I just ... I just wanted to ask how Hector was . I haven 't heard from him . I 'm sorry . I know he did the right thing . He was trying to warn people . So were you . Yeah . I lost something . I know about the bus , and I know the kind of pain you 're in right now . Don 't give up . I haven 't . Emily ! I have a jet waiting . I 'm going to get you out of here . No ... Are-are you kidding me ? - You 're just going to leave ? - I want you safe . Come on . No , look around you . This is all because of you . We didn 't know . Emily , I 'm sorry . We didn 't know . You have been sorry since I was 10 years old ! Emily , listen to me . No , you ... you need to go . - No , listen ... - You need to go right now ! You can hate me , you cannot speak to me for the next 10 years , but I 'm going to get you and Dylan out of here . Dylan is out there . - What ? - He 's out there , and I - I don 't even know if he 's alive ! You did this . You knew it was wrong , and you did anyways . What could be more important than our children ? Tell them . Tell them ! Ms. Preston . He 's waking up . Tommy ? Tommy 's awake . Hey , buddy , how you doing ? Oh , hang on , go slow . Keep your head back for a minute . How are you doing ? Are you dizzy ? Let 's get some water here ... Here , just a sip . Just keep your head back for a minute , okay ? Just give him some air , guys . He 's okay . Ms. Preston , look . These weren 't here before . There must have been a signal . There 's a signal ? - There 's a signal ? - Yes ! There ! Try texting . Sometimes , a text will go through even if a call won 't . - Hey . - Hey . Thanks . My cell ... Oh , my god . It 's Dylan . It 's Dylan . What ? He 's okay . ' Oh , my god . - He 's okay ! Okay . Okay . Sergeant ? Sergeant ? Come on ... Anything ? Tell them we 're at Recreation Park , the south end . Gate D. All right , we 're going to see the same thing topside as you 'll have on your instrument panel , but it 's up to you to guide the operator to the entry point . Now , it is a very narrow target . When the release point has been reached , you 'll see this on your screen . The bomb is on a five-minute delay , and you 're going to need every second of that to get back up past the blast range . You 'd better pull me up quick . There 's one more thing . The Titan was designed for a maximum 15-minute atmospheric re-entry . Every minute past that , and this thing 's going to start coming apart . Yeah . Okay , thank you . It 's ready . Good luck to you . Thanks . Come on , Audrey , I 'm the luckiest geologist in the world right now . I get to go into the bowels of a volcano . Just like going to Disneyland . Not exactly the happiest place on earth . We don 't even know if the hospital 's up and running . We don 't know anything . Hang in there , buddy , okay ? My friend 's hurt . Can you give us a ride back into town ? They 're evacuating . We 're not going back . There 's nowhere to go , man . It 's all blocked that way ! Please . Please ! I 'm sorry . I 've got a family . Please ... Hey . We 'll celebrate when you get back . These prototype tiles are the next generation from those used for the Space Shuttle , but if the heat gets too much , if this tinker toy doesn 't hold up the way we expect it to , don 't be a damn hero . Say the word , we 'll pull you up . Then what ? Exactly . I 'll be up here . Now , we 've gone through this on paper , but real quick ... we 've rigged it so you have rotation control . There 's your thermal monitor . Your depth , your temperature , and your oxygen . Keep your eye on that gauge . Now , if any of these get to the red line , we 've gotta pull you back up , understood ? Yeah . Good luck . Thanks . Okay , Matthew , can you hear us ? Copy Okay , we 're extending the boom now . Copy I 'm ready , Harry . Copy that . Okay , lowering the vehicle . CalTech models are projecting an Extinction Level Event in 30 minutes . Hull integrity index 100 % . Okay , Matthew , we 're 10 meters in . Copy Hull integrity index 96 % . 25 minutes and counting . We 're losing structural fast on this thing . Hull integrity index 78 % . 20 minutes and counting . Matthew ! How you enjoying that sauna ? Funny . I 'm not seeing any breach . O2 levels seem okay . I understand . Very good . I just spoke to our field lieutenant . They 're having a hard time getting into the area . Can 't you just send a helicopter ? No , there is still too much ash . It wouldn 't make it . We 're doing the best we can . Try him again . Guys , try to stay awake . Ava , keep your brother awake , okay ? Okay , Ms. Preston . You guys need help ? I need to get him to a doctor in Paxton . Can you take us ? There 's nowhere to go . Please . He 's gonna die . Let 's go . Let 's go ... We made it , Hank . Almost there . Looks like it 's getting worse . What do you think , Hank ? S-Sorry about Daniels , man . - Wake up . - Yeah .

 MILNER : This has one number on it , mine . JESSICA : I was given to a man called Krystos . He taught me how to steal . How to fight . They caught him , tortured him , killed him . - ( COCKS GUN ) - ARBY : What was my name ? LETTS : Your name was Pietre . - Get out ! - Jesus Christ ! It was chemical poisoning . No flu at all ! I 've copies with lawyers . I want Anya released . I need to see you . I 'm in trouble . That 's not me ! That is not me ! ... and we see if he 's got the Chinese character for " rabbit " - carved on his belly . - And then what ? Whack him ? ! ( GUNSHOT ) We go now , and we take him with us . JESSICA : I want the manuscript , and you are going to take me to it . Of course . That 's why I 'm here . ( DOOR CREAKS ) Do you have it ? What , no kiss first ? - ( THUNDER RUMBLES ) - So , you 're getting tremors . Well , it could be psychosomatic . Or the Deel 's could be activating . Thoraxin 's an experimental drug . It 's hard to gauge its efficacy . Well , then , why am I taking it ? Because there 's every chance it 's keeping you alive . You know , when Jessica handed them the manuscript , she didn 't give them it all . She ripped out a few pages . She must have given them to someone . Grant ? Now , Becky , if you can get me those pages , I can get them to someone who can help , someone who can expose this . And how do you know she did that ? I keep telling you , I know people . That 's why you need to stick with me . - What ? Hang on ! - I can always get you what you need . Where 's the rest ? That ... That 'll last me a day or two . Where 's the rest ? Get me those pages . If you want to keep control of your fucking limbs . ( ENGINE STARTS ) Er , supplies . Have you seen Alice yet ? IAN : Yeah . She 's over there with Grant . Acting as if nothing happened . BECKY : Is that the vaccine ? IAN : You really think this kills people ? What about Letts ? - Have you checked ? - No . We were waiting for you . ( SIGHS ) Hey , fancy a chat later , Grant ? There 's something we need to talk about . Hey . How are you , Alice ? - Do you want to talk ? - No , thank you , Becky . Do you ? Well ? Are we going to talk to him ? - ( GASPING ) - ( FOOTSTEPS ) - BECKY : Right , you do it . - IAN : Why me ? BECKY : Well , you 're ... you 're a bloke ! ( GASPING ) It 's not Mr Rabbit . Shit . ( GASPS ) The ... The child , did she kill Monroe ? IAN : Yes . Why were you going to see him ? I was going to warn him . I ... I always liked him . Could I have some more water , please ? - Where were you taking the vaccine ? - To a laboratory , for testing . - And you do that ? Yourself ? - Well , I am a scientist . Or is it just to stop anyone seeing what 's in it ? We know about the GCHN1 protein . We know about Janus . Then why are you talking to me ? IAN : We 're curious to know which race it is you want to murder . ( LAUGHS ) ( COUGHS ) Is that what you think is going on ? Oh ! - Are you laughing ? - ( GRUNTS ) - Laughing , is it ? - Please , please , please ... - Who is it this time ? - ... please don 't hurt me . - ( GASPS ) - The white ones ? The brown ones ? Not the Jews ' turn now , then , is it ? - We 're not that . - Yeah ? See this eye ? Your men pulled it out of my head with a fucking spoon ! - ( GASPS ) - And they killed my dad ! - Why ? - Wilson , this isn 't ... Who have you lost , eh ? ! She 's lost someone . Alice has lost her mum . Who have you fucking lost ? ! I want to know why they 're doing this ! LETTS : Wilson ? Your name is Wilson ? You must be Ian . And you 're Becky . - How do you know that ? - You were given a phone ? It contains a tracking device . They know where you are . We always have . Oh , my God . I 've been abandoned . ( GASPS ) ( sue seas ) OK , does she want the child ? Er , I ... I don 't know . I ... I don 't think so . The ... the people who , er ... employ her , I think it 's caused trouble ... - I ... I 'm sorry I let them tell you . - Employ ? ! The people who employ her ? You mean the pimps who trafficked her . The filthy criminals who were bribing us and who you gave our money to when you wanted to fuck her ? ! ( SOBS ) I can 't even look at you ! ( SNIFFS AND SIGHS ) This , er ... thing you have over these people , will it make us safe ? Yes , it makes us safe . Because we want a child . It 's your child and it ... Is it a boy or a girl ? It 's a boy . And he needs a home . WILSON : I think I 've found it . It 's wired in the battery so it transmits when the phone 's off . - So Milner knows we 're there ? - No . No , hang on . I mean ... are we sure ? - I mean , does she know ? - Of course she knew ! - Well , who gave her the phone ? - Ian , she 's tracking us . The only reason why they 're not here is cos they 're waiting for the manuscript . It doesn 't make sense . She saved us . She got Grant off the hook . What 's the point of setting ... Have you felt any tingling yet ? Tremors ? I 'd be grateful if you told me . I worked so hard on Deel 's . - What 's your blood pressure ? - I 'm not after a fucking check-up . Why ? Why did you do this ? We weren 't interested in what Deel 's did to the subject . We just wanted to know if we could engineer a change that would be passed on . And we did . As an experiment ... it was a success . Success ? Did you just ... My father died of this . ( SIGHS ) I 've done so many terrible things . But what we are doing is right . IAN : Did you ... did you say " right " ? Brown people , white people , Jews ... I assume you 're referring to Carvel 's supposed paper on eugenics . - But Carvel was misunderstood . - Yeah , just like Hitler . He wasn 't talking about race . He was talking about survival ! We 've now passed seven billion on this planet . When I was born , it was a little over two . Food prices are rising . Oil is ending . When our resources end in 20 years , given everything that we know of our species , do you really think we 're going to just ... share ? So , your answer to that is some kind of genocide ? No , it is not . It is not genocide . Our answer to this is Janus . Janus consists of a protein and an amino acid . Independently of each other , they 're harmless . But when they 're brought together in the subject , they act as a genetic trigger that prevents chromosomal division . The cell targeted can no longer replicate itself and is thereby rendered useless . The change ... is permanent . And hereditary . BECKY : And ... which cells are targeted ? Those that control fertility , Becky . The purpose of Janus is to sterilise . The purpose of Janus is to sterilise the entire human race . - They 've got Letts ? - Yes . I believe Letts had the vaccine with him . - What ? - No need for panic . Carvel 's work is almost in our hands . Let 's not lose that by being rash . This civil servant of yours is much more worrying . You 've handled him badly . He now has the capacity to expose us . He 's a fucking civil servant . I didn 't expect him to take risks . - Perhaps you should end him ? - He would have prepared for that . End him . Don 't give me orders . Do you understand ? I am a minister , and I don 't take orders from you ! I 'll deal with him . You need to deal with this . Deal with this ? How ' ? By getting Letts back . Back ? Why on earth would we want him back ? LETTS : Janus affects 90 to 95 % of the population , leaving only one in 20 fertile . We predict the population will plateau at 500 million in just under 100 years . By then , normal breeding rates should resume but on a planet that will feel empty . You 're fucking insane . LETTS : To do nothing is insane . You accuse us of being genocidal . Not acting is genocide . Where do you think your food comes from , Ian ? A third of the world 's farmland is now useless due to soil degradation , yet we keep producing more mouths to feed . And what 's your answer to that ? Energy-saving light bulbs ? But we 're doing things . We 're ... We 're changing things . You know the person who had the greatest positive impact on the environment of this planet ? Genghis Khan . Because he massacred 40 million people . There was no-one to farm the land . Forests grew back . Carbon was dragged out of the atmosphere . And had this " monster " not existed , there 'd be another billion of us today jostling for space on this dying planet . Yet Janus massacres no-one . It 's without violence . This is why you did this to me ? - This is why you killed my dad ? - It is . And there are a thousand other crimes on my conscience . But do you know what I see , Wilson ? - A planet turned into a desert . - ( BIRDSONG ) A thousand million souls starving dying . And we can stop this with Janus . BECKY : Why are you telling us this ? It 's not just to save yourself . You could have said anything to save yourself . What we have is an approximation . We 're not Carvel . We don 't have his genius . We 'll know within three months whether a version of Janus works . Then we 're poised to repeat it across the globe . If it works . But there is one way of making sure . Get us the manuscript . - You 're asking us to help you ? - Not me . Humanity . All over the world people are helping , good people . - If we had the manuscript , we ... - Right , you need to stop talking . Not to do this is to condemn billions to starvation and misery . We need to find out if Milner 's with them . If she 's not , then we need to get that vaccine to her ... WILSON : Why ? I mean , what he 's saying ... isn 't that ... wright ? Right ? Sterilising the human race ? - One in 20 will remain fertile . - You shut up ! We should at least ... think about it . IAN : No , Wilson , we should not fucking think about it . We need to stop him now . ( SIGHS ) Cos if they are right , and we stop them then what does that make us ? Wilson , they killed your dad . They tortured you . That 's who they are . - ( SCREAMS ) - ( SCREAMS AND GASPS ) ( sons ) ( SOBBING SUBSIDES ) You need to go there . There 's no cameras , but you will have to uncuff me . Shut up . - ( COCKS GUN ) - If you don 't give the manuscript to me , I 'll have no hesitation in shooting your ankles , shins , knees . I will make you talk , and if I have to do it in there , I will . OK ? ( HE BREATHES HEAVILY ) what now ? We talk to the man . Where ? The counter . Eggs , beans , chips , sausage , bacon , two toast and a cup of tea . YOU ? Twice . You think this is funny ? They 'll be after us . We need to eat . Keep up strength . Rule number one . You know that . ( BREATHES HEAVILY ) Don 't worry . I always come here . They know me . It 's my local . Eat . I bought it for you . It 's good . It 's nice to talk to you in person . I 've always wanted to . I 'm a fan . I 've read the manuscript , Jessica . I know what kind of man your father was . What about Krystos ? Did he love you ? I think a child needs love . ( BREATHES HEAVILY ) My name 's ... ( BREATHES HEAVILY ) My name 's Pietre . This is disgusting . Only a dog would eat this shit . It 's slop . And it 's a fucking roadside café , by the way . This is no-one 's " local " . They don 't know you here at all . You 're cranky . Do you get those dreams a lot , Jessica ? Finish . We are going . I need to go toilet . I need to do the other one . There might be some noises . You wanted to talk , Becky ? Yeah , maybe later , Grant . The hardest thing 's not knowing , isn 't it ? Constant question . Will today be the day it triggers ? What will it feel like when my throat closes for the last time ? I could squeeze your neck so easy . Is the Thoraxin working ? Donaldson told us he was supplying you . I thought you 'd slept with him for the Thoraxin . But ... now that I 've met you , Becky , now that I know you , I realise it must have been so much more complex than that . You don 't know me . He wants to sell us the manuscript . But I would much rather it be you that benefits . Get it to us and we 'll take care of you . Think we 've got a plan . - You want to take the vaccine to Milner ? ! - IAN : Not to her . We 'll leave it outside . You and me go in ... we find out whose side she 's on and then we decide . You and me ? But ... what about Wilson ? I want to ... talk to Letts . Well , what are you going to do ? He 's right at the heart of this . He must know the name of Mr Rabbit . What ? No . Hang on . We can 't ... we can 't start doing stuff like that . He 's talking to save his own skin . He needs persuading . Fuck . But ... Well , then , why you ? Cos I know what it feels like . Take Alice and Grant . It 's best they 're out the house for this . You stay here with the vaccine . OK ? BECKY : You sure this is the right thing to do ? No . Not really . But what 's the worst that could happen ? She could kill us . Or hand us over to them to kill us . Or torture us . ( DOOR SLAMS ) Jesus Christ ! Did you break in ? We tried to contact you . You didn 't answer . They 're on to me , for Christ 's sake . I can 't just ... ( SIGHS ) It 's not what you think . You knew ? You 're with them ? It 's not as simple as that . I 'm working with them , yes . But I 'm not on their side . How do you think I stay alive ? Don 't fucking move ! Don 't you move . You gave us away . Because I knew they 'd do nothing . They 're not interested in you . They want the manuscript . They want to ... I was supposed to encourage you to get it from Jessica and , when you had it , I was to hand you over . - Jesus Christ ! - Which I 'm not going to do . We trusted you , and you lied to us . Give us one good reason why we should believe you now . One ? One reason ? ( LABOURED BREATHING ) MILNER : This is Jake . My son . Yes , Becky . It 's Deel 's . I told you about his father . Part of the investigation meant going undercover at Corvadt , where they gave him Deel 's . Just like your dad , Becky . Jake 's triggered about 18 months ago . He 's done remarkably well but for the last six months ... It 's ... just a matter of weeks now . Now do you believe me ? So , we can give you the vaccine , then ? - I mean , you said if we had proof ... - We can 't . They know about her . He 's right . What I did for Ian alerted them . I understand they 're coming for me tonight . It 's OK . I 've got Jake this far . He won 't mind going now . I have , um ... I have something we can take . Jesus Christ , Milner . What do we do with the vaccine ? Ian , they ... they 're going to kill her . There 's a man at the Department of Health . Michael Dugdale . MI5 routinely monitors advisers and his behaviour has been ... I think he 's with us . Get the vaccine to him . I think he might be on our side . Milner ! I mean ... you 've got to run ! Jake can 't run , and I 'm not leaving him . Jake and I would like a few moments on our own before ... Best to go out the way you came in . Look , I 'll take it to this guy . You 'd better get back to Wilson . I 'll take Grant . He 's bound to recognise him . I suppose I 'd better take Alice , too . Becky . You don 't know it 's triggered . That may never be you . GEOFF : How 's Jen ? - DUGDALE : Devastated . - But still alive . Look , I am trying to protect you . What we did to you last night was the start of an unimaginable nightmare . Stop being so stupid . You are tiny . If I give you what I have , you 'll kill me . So , I 'm going to keep it . Oh , and you 're going to buy my silence . 350,000 every year . Make it look like a ... a trust fund from some ... unknown aunt . Whatever . That way , I 'll have an incentive to keep quiet . This might be acceptable . And I want Anya out of prison today . Jen and I want to meet with her this afternoon . As you wish . Well , this might turn out nicely after all . ARBY : It 's not easy , is it ? Growing up without a childhood . ( BREATHES HEAVILY ) I was brought up in an institution . My room was a cell , really . There was an air vent there . I drew pictures around it , faces to ... keep the devil out . I was told I 'm like this because of early trauma . I disconnected . - A beneficial side effect , I suppose . ( GASPS ) I know this place . - ( GASPS ) - It was me . I killed Krystos . I tied him to that tree . I broke arms and fingers tore the skin from his body . And in the end I opened his stomach reached inside and pulled out what was in my hand . I was 15 years old . But he didn 't say one word . Didn 't speak . He didn 't say where you were . - That 's how much he loved you . - ( GASPS ) I wanted you to know that you were loved . Because I wasn 't . You can kill me now and get revenge for Krystos , or I can take you to the manuscript . I can take you to what 's left of your father . But I won 't do it at the point of a gun . You have to trust me . Throw away the gun or it stops ... here . I don 't need a gun to kill you . The minute you hand it over , I will rip the life from your body ! ( DOOR CREAKS ) Wilson . Wilson , what have you got there ? Wilson , I thought I detected a certain sympathy with our views , and you wouldn 't be alone . Wilson , please , please , please don 't do ... Do you want money ? I 'll give you money . I ... I 'll give you whatever you want . Wilson , please ! Please don 't do ... - Please ... - ( METAL CLINKS ) ( SIGHS ) You 're right . It 's better than genocide . WILSON : Follow the path for about half an hour until you get to an A-road . ( HEAVY BREATHING ) You 'll know what to do from there . I 'll make it look like you escaped . - ( HEAVY BREATHING ) - LETTS : That 's my assistant 's e-mail . He 's the one . If you get the manuscript , contact him . ( GROANS ) ( GROANS ) You 're having my husband 's baby . Today ... new evidence is coming to light , and you will be free by morning . - I ... I will be free ? - Yes . You will be free , and you can do whatever you like . I promise . But what we would like , what we propose , is that you come with us . With you ? I don 't understand . We want to find you a flat , and you 'll be safe there for the entire term of your pregnancy . You 'll have the best care that we can get for you , I promise . And when you have the baby we would like you to hand over the child to us . We will pay you £ 250,000 . My husband ... My husband is weak . But he will make a very good father . And I will love your child more than you can imagine . I promise . And can I see my baby ? No . No , that ... that is part of the deal . - ( SOBS ) - You can never see your child again . ( HE BREATHES DEEPLY ) Where are we ? That street leads to a building they used to use . Old research base . Abandoned now . The manuscript . I hid it in there . Have you got your seat belt on ? JESSICA : Oh , Christ ! ( GUNSHOT ) - Are you OK ? - Where did you get that gun ? The café . Toilet cistern . Let 's go . ( HE COUGHS AND WHEEZES ) They 'll have only just set that up . We 've got a little time before they move in force . Jesus Christ . You prepared all this ? It 'll keep them back ! - ( DOOR CREAKS ) - This was where I grew up . It 's called ... tonalite gneiss . It 's the oldest rock in the world . From a rock plateau in Canada . Where did you get that ? He used to say , " This rock gives you permission to do anything , " because , ultimately , we 're all just the blink of an eye . " I was the first person he experimented on . He ... looked for the nearest human who wouldn 't talk . His son . I don 't believe you . But his experiments went wrong . - No . - And I was changed into this . - This isn 't possible . - ( LOUD CRASH ) The manuscript 's here , but I 'm warning you not to take it . Don 't do what I did . Don 't find out the truth about our father . Give it to me . ( BREATHES HEAVILY ) ( IN HALES ) ( HE BREATHES HEAVILY ) ( FLAMES CRACKLE ) You look more gorgeous every day . Jesus Christ ! Stop that ! Why 's everybody hitting me ? You 're selling it ? You 're selling it to them ? You only want it from me so you can give it to them ! OK , yes , all right . I should have told you . But I fully intended to split the money . It sterilises people . Do you know that ? And you just want to make money from it . Just make money ? Did you say , just make money ? If they do this , it 's social and economic Armageddon . What do you think it 'll be like , getting old , if there are no young people to pay for it ? Do you think there 'll be pension plans , health care , free fucking bus passes ? In the future , if you 're old , you 're dead unless you have wealth . So instead of stopping it , you just want to make money ? Stop it ? Why should I want to stop it ? They 're right . Of course they 're right . We have to do it . You 're disgusting . And I will never give you one part of Utopia . OK . OK , but tomorrow at noon , I 'm going to be here with every ounce of Thoraxin I have . Get me those pages , you get it all . Enough to keep you going for ... years . But if you 're not here at midday , Becky I tell you , I 'm going to throw the whole fucking lot in that lake . ( CAR DOOR SHUTS ) ( ENGINE STARTS ) - Michael Dugdale ? - Yeah ? I 'd like to talk to you . About the Russian flu vaccine . What ? I ... I don 't ... - Are you a journalist ? - No , I 'm not a journalist . There 's something in the vaccine . What do you mean ? Is this ... Did you read about the massacre at Bainstow School ? Yeah . Grant . Oh , my God . He was set up . We 've got something for you . A sample of the vaccine . Come on , quick . Come on , quick . Michael ? Are you OK ? It ... It 's fine , Jen . It 's just ... Look , I need to sort something out . Well , can I see it ? It 's OK . - Where did you get this ? - It doesn 't matter . But that is it . And do you know what it does ? It sterilises people . 90 to 95 % of the people who receive the Russian flu vaccine will become sterile . Look , can you help us ? There was a woman . Milner , MI5 . She said you 'd help . - I mean , are you sure ? - They 're everywhere . They kill people . We 've seen them . They ... They killed her mother . There ... There 's a man . A scientist . He 's not a good man , but he ... he knows people . You stay here . I need to make a call . Er ... are you hungry ? - Do you want some food ? - No . Thank you . We 're fine . Do you think we can trust him ? I don 't reckon we should be hanging around . I 'm going to get him a sample to him . I can make a trade . And he 'll put us onto someone who can help . You serious ? I mean it . Do you need somewhere to stay ? No , we 've got ... Come on . We 've got friends we need to get back to . Well , how do I get in touch with you ? Do you have ... Do you have a phone ? We don 't trust phones . OK . Come back here tomorrow . Same time ? OK . Sorry . - Armed police ! Stay where you are ! - Move ! ( ALICE SCREAMS ) Come on ! - No ! No , no ! - Get down ! Down ! - Grant ! Grant ! - Get off me ! ( ALICE SCREAMS ) ( ALICE SCREAMS ) ( SIGHS ) I need water . What did you tell them ? I ... Tell them ? I told them nothing . I ... I need water . They have the vaccine . Yes , but they don 't know what it is . They 're just ... children . They know nothing . They know exactly what it is , because you told them . No . I said nothing , I said nothing . ASSISTANT : Enough of this . Finish him . He 's served his purpose . He made good cover . Now he 's a liability . It 's time to end this . You want me to ... Well , I 'm not going to do it myself , am I ? Everything 's been arranged . His medical records now show a history of depression . We 've men ready to take his body to hang from a bridge in Richmond . - We have a coroner there . - Oh , no . No , I ... I don 't think I can . Oh , yes , of course you can . You see , it 's an order . I 'm giving you an order . ( LETTS SOBS ) ( DOOR CLOSES )

 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... I swore an oath . We all did . To protect the world against the much appeared world . It 's got to be some sort of activation signal to Hydra members within S.H.I.E.L.D. We 've had a wolf in the herd the whole time . They 've infiltrated the highest levels of our organization . - Ward ! - Ward ! Ward , you don 't have to do this ! - Fitz ... is he okay ? - He 's alive . On behalf of the United States armed forces , I order you to stand down . We 're not Hydra . We 're agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Well , right now , to the rest of the world , that 's the same thing . Fury always said a man can accomplish anything when he realizes he 's a part of something bigger . You want me to start over , rebuild S.H.I.E.L.D. - What is this place ? - I call it the playground . It is an honor to meet you , sir . I know we don 't have much , but what we have is yours , Director Coulson . 2x01 - " Shadows " _ _ I don 't think I need to remind you that the clock is ticking . We are almost finished loading . Herr Reinhardt , I-I fear Schmidt ... Oh , there 's no reason left to fear the Red Skull . He 's dead . However , his vision is not . The work Hydra has done will live on . - The Obelisk ? - They are bringing it out now . Carefully , I hope . I don 't understand . I thought this stockpile held only artifacts . Not everything we dug out of the ground was an antique , my friend . Some of it was quite advanced . - Is this the reason these men ... ? - Hmm ? Ja . The Red Skull said it may hold the answer ... the answer to death itself . I 'll give them an " A " for effort . Guten tag , boys . All right , nice and calm . No sudden moves , or we 'll tie a blasting cap to your ... Hey , Dugan , what 's the German word for " nuts " ? I don 't know , Jim . But tie a blasting cap to them , I 'll bet we 'll hear it . Put it down . Down . These assets are now under the protection of the Strategic scientific reserve . They 'll be relocated and hidden out of sight , indefinitely ... as will you . Cut off one head , two more shall grow in its place . Then I guess we 'll keep cutting them off . Get him out of here . All right , boys , let 's pack it up . Agent Carter , what the hell is all this stuff ? Dangerous . Right now , we need to contain everything and get it out of enemy territory . Mr. Stark plans to go through it tonight . And that , we must never touch . This is the last Hydra site we know of . They 're finally beaten . You don 't sound thrilled . Well , these things can 't simply be boxed up . Someone needs to establish a permanent unit during peacetime . To keep dangerous technology contained ? And watch over people like Stark who are toying with it . Until then , all we can do is box it up , lock it up , and dedicate ourselves to making sure it never sees the light of day . _ We 've got ears on them . The package is in the open . Don 't engage until the deal 's done . Copy that . - Trip , we got eyes ? - Now we do . That 's what I 'm selling . I 'm sure you 'd like to see some credentials . Agent Browning , for ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. , you seem awfully indifferent to who we are . What you are is the highest bidder . Whether you 're in it for profit or for Hydra , it doesn 't concern me , not anymore . That 's what we want to hear . - What are they buying from him ? - Intel , not hardware . The mystery I 'd like to solve is , why should we be paying you so much ? This looks like a box . Sorry ... a picture of a box ... a picture of a box you don 't have . The government has it , along with thousands of other assets they 've seized from S.H.I.E.L.D. , and they don 't know what to make of half of them . I worked in a S.H.I.E.L.D. containment facility that had hundreds of boxes that look just like this . But this is the only one that has a level 10 classified file dedicated to it . You 're selling us a needle in a haystack . Finding the haystack is up to you . I know your reputation . I 'm sure you 'll be fine . What I don 't appreciate is you changing the terms on me now . We 're asking for clarification , Browning . You 're the one who changed the terms , bringing more than the two guards we agreed upon . I only brought two guards . - What the hell are you doing here ? - Who was that ? - A third party . - A party 's what you 'd call that ? He 's gone . 25-foot drop . This was supposed to be an undercover operation . You want to explain why you 're shadowing us ? - We were your backup , which you needed . - Yeah . So did he . Sir , Mark 's down . Third party , possibly Hydra , and we 're out in the open . What are our orders ? Go dark . They 're fugitives , and they deserve to be punished . We witnessed the single greatest intelligence collapse in recorded history , George . We have a duty to the American people to hunt down those responsible . So , no , I don 't sleep most nights . General Talbot , you said you have S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel and weaponry locked in a secure facility , so is it fair to say that S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Hydra terrorists who poisoned its ranks have been defeated ? The corrupt institution has been dismantled , yes . We cut down the tree , we pulled up the roots , but let 's just say I 'll rest easier when we throw it all on the bonfire . - So , you didn 't get them all ? - Our black-market contacts were the reason the guy believed we weren 't with S.H.I.E.L.D. Coulson knows Hartley . She 's the only person on your team he trusts . - But why 'd you break silhouette protocol ? - He ordered us to . We can 't maintain solid cover with agents tailing us . And we can 't be sure you won 't run off with the money . Any idea how that freak show found us , Hartley ? - I have a theory . - Cool it . The man said we were the highest bidder . That means he sent the word out wide . And he paid for that mistake . - Yes , he did . - That 's an understatement . Operation didn 't go well , I take it ? - What gave you that idea ? - That 's a shame , man . I was hoping that agent you were scoping out would have some tech we could use . Sorry , Mack . No new toys . - You get anything ? - A new enemy . I know . I know . Director wants you for debrief . The feeling is mutual . Throw him up on the big screen . We 'll tell him that his enemies have gone bulletproof . - He 's in his office . - Wow . Coulson 's here ? Kind of buried the lead there , Bill . - Just Agent May . - Copy that . Really ? Well , tell him I 'd like to voice my opinion , too , on being kept in the dark , 'cause I don 't like being left ... out . Get used to it . So , the guy was bulletproof , huh ? That 's sweet . What ... like , protective clothing or ... ? Maybe . We found these metal shards . They broke off with the bullet hits . - I 'm gonna take it to the lab . - I 'll let Coulson know . It 'll be good to see him ... - if I see him . - He 's a busy man . Sorry . That 's all I can give you . Try to move up with your head down . And , hey , only use the dead drop from now on . There aren 't enough pay phones left in this country . - Hi . - You 're the man in charge , but I 'm in charge of you , remember ? - I had two rules . - Avoid field operations ... And check in with me every few days . - It 's been two weeks . - And I 'm flying back out tonight . I have to focus on recruitment . It 's starting to wear me down . - The hours ? - The numbers . Between the traitors , military detainees , and the sell-outs in the private sector , the people who could possibly be considered loyal to S.H.I.E.L.D. is not impressive . And they 're scattered all over the damn globe . Well , you have no choice but to meet them face-to-face , - get a read on them . - I know , and I prefer it . But flying economy blows . Any progress on the cloaking equipment ? - Like I can tell . - Well , we need it now , badly . Our plane 's been gathering dust for months , but I still can 't risk a takeoff with this guy trying to throw us on a bonfire , so flying coach it is ... Though I did score an exit row on the way back from London . - And what was in London ? - Allies ... ready to be activated , if necessary . It 's a decent start , but it 's gonna be slow-going without more resources . Bad news on that front . We were hoping agent Browning would be a friend . And if not , at least sell us tech . Negative on both . - The assassin ... Hydra ? - Likely . Possibly gifted . Killed Browning . He wanted the intel . Another 0-8-4 , I guess . What 's your assessment of Hartley 's people ? You know what I think . They 're mercenaries , here for the money . - But what 's your assessment ? - They 're good mercenaries . Well , Hartley spent a lot of years undercover . Those are the kinds of friends you make . If she trusts them ... - What ? - S.S.R. I just read about this . - It 's not in any of the history books . - No . It 's in Fury 's toolbox . Koenig , cancel my flights . What did it say about this ? An 0-8-4 could be anything ... that much we 've learned . It 's not just an 0-8-4 . It 's the first . And all Fury knew about was the trail of bodies that follows it . Talbot 's saying he 's beaten both sides , but we 're just hiding underground . If Hydra gets their hands on this , they may not have to . Hail Hydra . Yeah . Is the package secure ? Uploading now . He expected a positive result and sent a gift along as a reward ... for this assignment and the next . A diamond . Musgravite , from the caves of Madagascar , one of the rarest gemstones in the world . He believes you 'll find its structure quite pleasurable . Was he right ? He 's always right . Whatever . It 's better than that crap you cooked up in Budapest . I didn 't have much to work with . It was farm to table . - It broke my tooth . - That 's ' cause you 're English . Hartley , Hunter , Idaho . What 's the word ? - In his office . - The director requests an audience ? Oh , the man doesn 't do requests . And , listen , when we get in there , no matter what you do , don 't look him in the eye . - Really ? - Nah , he 's all right . But you should both focus on not saying anything overly stupid . - Yes , ma 'am . - I 'm not making any promises . You took the material to the lab ? That 's the top priority now . Yeah . But I don 't know at it 'll get us . How 's the mood in there today ? It 's as good as can be expected . Fitz , now would be the time I 'd have you test the resonant frequencies of the metal so that I could determine what properties we 're dealing with . Fitz ? Fitz , can you even hear me ? Yes , Simmons , I can hear you . I 'm trying to hear the bloody resonant frequency you keep going on about , but all I can hear is you . Calm down . I 'm only asking . You haven 't been able to isolate ... No , I haven 't been able to isolate the ... the , um ... the ... - Rate of oscillation . - Yes . I was just about to say that , actually . And , no , I haven 't because it keeps ... um ... What 's the word again ? Give me the word . - Fluctuating . - Yes . Good . Fine . Thanks . Go away . - Have you taken your medication ? - Yes . - Hmm . - Don 't . Don 't . Please don 't touch anything . That 's the cloaking technology for the plane . - How 's it coming ? - Good . Slower than I 'd like . I 've had a few bumps , but it 's ... I 'm close . And I don 't need you mucking it up . - Fitz , I 'm trying to help . - I know . I know . But I also know how important cloaking is , okay ? So I just need everybody to be ... everybody to be ... I just need everybody to be , um ... - Patient . - Yes . You need to be patient with yourself , Fitz . - You 're almost there . - Yeah . Yeah , I 'm almost there . - Any update on the metal we found ? - Yeah . Yeah ... Um , no . Actually , no . I 'm just having a bit of trouble identifying the ... a bit of trouble ... I 'm having a bit of trouble identifying the material . Okay . Yeah , so , this is the same lead that we use in our bullets , but there 's ... there is something ... bleeding . Uh ... Uh , okay . That 's ... are you ... can you see that ? - Looks like flesh . - Yeah , I see it . - It 's blood . - Good . - I mean , that 's ... what ? That 's weird . - Can you figure out whose blood ? That shouldn 't be too hard . - That shouldn 't be too hard . - I 'll stay and help anyway . - So the man had powers ? - We emptied our mags at the guy . Might as well have been blowing kisses . - Never seen anything like it . - I have . And usually these encounters come with better financial compensation . - Hunter ... - What ? - Don 't be yourself right now . - You like me like this . Look , you both have your S.H.I.E.L.D. traditions and all that nonsense , and personal reasons for being dedicated to the cause , but you 've known me a long time , Izzy . And what gets me out of bed in the morning ? - He 's not a big picture kind a guy . - Sound like my ex-wife . And you should have listened to her , too . DNA match . Carl Creel . He was on the index . More importantly , crossed off the index . S.H.I.E.L.D. protocol . Sometimes hostile gifted individuals are put down . - Well , they didn 't do a great job here . - They didn 't try . - Check who was the supervising agent . - Agent John Garrett . They must have faked Creel 's termination , recruited him . Well , now we know he 's Hydra . John Garrett ? Isn 't that your mate who , you know ... - went to the dark side ? - Oh , yeah . Then he went nuts . It 's a little bit strange . I mean , they 're exactly the same . You really think they were just twins ? Come on . I have heard all your theories , Trip . And Koenig 's always mentioning other brothers . Every day , another brother . If he brings up one more brother , I don 't know what I 'm gonna do . Coulson said we can trust him . There 's something fishy going on there , man . You 'll go crazy staring at this crap . What is it again ? Not sure . Something Garrett was messing with . Coulson put me on it a month ago , searching deep web contacts , even Rising Tide , looking for a match . I 've got nothing . There he is . Happy to see you , sir . - Agent Triplett , Skye . - Sir . - Can you give us a moment ? - Watch this . What ? No hugs ? He was really looking forward to it . I 've cross-checked the writing from the lab with the new images you 've given me . Mostly the same , but the code breakers haven 't found anything ... That 's not why I 'm here . The bulletproof assassin you encountered on the sting ? We know who he is . - You want me to go down there , don 't you ? - You 're the only one who can . Is this really what it takes for you and I to get a one-on-one these days ? Why now ? Because the technology in play warrants it . And do I have a say in this ? Copy that . There 's an inertial confinement laser barrier down there , Which is cool . Now this button turns it soundproof . This button makes it opaque . Just tell me there isn 't an " off " button I can accidentally hit . You 'll be safe . I promise . Aren 't you a sight for sore eyes . I told Coulson weeks ago that I was willing to speak to you ... to give you intelligence . Why now ? Something bad happen ? Carl Creel . Garrett reported him dead . Turns out he 's alive . Do you have any information on that ? How have you been ? The name sounds familiar . Do you have a picture ? Coulson didn 't tell you . I went through a ... rough stretch . First pair of pants they gave me had a ... a button on the back . They took that away . But you fold a piece of paper just right , it gets sharp . When they took that away , I started running at the walls . - You should have run faster . - I 'm through all that . When I came out of sedation , I was clear-headed , accepting ... of who I am , what I 've done , and why . You sure about this ? Giving Ward exactly what he wants ? Of course he said he 'd only talk to Skye . - He wants to fill her head with lies . - He hasn 't lied yet . Your arms tell a different story . I see May 's training you . She 's got you favoring your left side first - ' cause you 're right-handed . Smart . - I 'm gonna say this once . I 'm not gonna believe a word that comes out of your mouth . But if a single word is about anything other than the question that I 'm asking , I walk . Okay . Creel was a boxer , nicknamed the Crusher . Turns out any opponent has a glass jaw when you have steel fists under your gloves . Garrett thought he 'd be an asset . Now , once Creel touches a substance , he can absorb it and somehow consciously transform the molecules of his body into that substance . He wouldn 't tell us how , but he enjoys the way it feels ... Almost as much as he enjoys killing . You two must have gotten along great . Well , this was fun but pointless . We 've already figured that stuff out , - so if you don 't know where to find him , then ... - Wait . When Hydra was communicating with S.H.I.E.L.D. , we 'd use white noise in the gaps between S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s quantum key distribution channels to hide messages . Now , S.H.I.E.L.D. might be gone , but not those frequencies . If Hydra is giving commands to Creel , - that 'll be how . - We 'll see . It 's true , and so will be every word I say to you for the rest of my life . I 'm not asking for forgiveness . I just want to help you . And when that information proves true , I hope you 'll come back . There 's so much I want to tell you about your father . And believe it or not , there 's a directive going out over those channels right now . Now , I can ping an echo request , see if there 's other receivers out there , how many Hydra agents can communicate this way . So he 's telling the truth . It looks like it . Thank you . I guess that visit was the first of many , huh ? We kept Ward here for this reason , and it 's paying off . - What is his deal ? - I really don 't know , But it doesn 't matter , as long as he 's giving us an inside look - at Hydra 's operations . - Yeah , guys ? About that . You called it . Talbot hasn 't crushed Hydra . Just sent them slithering back to the shadows . I hate being right . The Navy ? He said that ? You must be kidding me . He said he likes boats . He likes messing with his old man is what it is . Don 't go far . Excuse me . - The Navy . - Yep . I 'll tell you what ... I 'll have something to say about that . Sweetheart , he 's 11 . I 'm sure you 'll wear him down soon enough . - Glenn . - Yeah ? - Your phone 's ringing . - That 's not my ... Take George . - Get to the car now . - What ? - Now ! - Okay . All right . Who is this ? General Talbot , you 're in danger . We 're here to ensure your safety . Please listen carefully . Agent Coulson , is this you ? Show yourself so we can talk about it . There 's no time . We 're here to protect you . - Listen to me . - No , you listen to me . I have my own protection and a cell for you at Gitmo . This is Talbot . I need reinforcements at my location now . Watch your six ! - Secure that bastard ! - Move , move , move ! General , let 's get you to cover , sir . General ! Go , go ! General , we should get you somewhere safe . General ? - Hi , again . - Son of a bitch . - Are these straps really necessary ? - You tell me . I guess . To ensure your safety . I 'm hoping we can work together , - be buddies like we used to be . - " Buddies " ? Last time we saw each other , you assaulted me and my team . So I could go stop a killer , which I did . Whereas you discovered that secret base . Got a big promotion , Brigadier General Talbot . Sounds like a pair of best buds to me . I got to say ... I respect you . You managed to evade us for an entire winter . And I respect you for making it so damn hard . - I 'm exhausted . - I 'll bet . But I want to make your job easier . Chasing us is a waste of resources , general . We 're the good guys , and we can help you catch the bad guys . Kidnapping me and tying me up in your honeycomb kill room is not helping your case . Do you think I 'm an idiot ? Oh , no . You 're the real deal . But you 're surrounded by people who constantly underestimate the threat they 're up against . Me and my people swore an oath we don 't intend to break ... to protect the innocent , to watch out for people ... - people like your son . - How dare you bring my family into this . We save lives , including yours , whether you like it or not . That was smooth . Riled him up , got him to grab the arm rests , and now active fingerprint analysis ... 89 % . We were there for your protection . Everyone is save . No one got hurt . Look at Koenig , running analysis . Well , it looks like we 've got our new golden boy . " New " ? As opposed to the original ? Yes ! Me . - And I 've been sidelined . - No . Well , I mean , maybe , but in the way that a player is sidelined due to injury in a football match . Football or American football ? 'Cause a head-trauma joke right now , Simmons , that 's in severely poor taste , even for you . And I see the way they look at me . Especially when they keep on asking about the ... - Cloaking . - Yeah . No , they 're just anxious about it . They know you 're nearly done . Yeah , well , I may not seem like the genius I used to be , but I still have ideas . - Yeah . - I 'm just having a hard time ... I 'm just having ... - Expressing them . - Yeah . And that ... that doesn 't mean that they have to treat me like ... - Like what , Fitz ? - Treat me like I 'm gonna break . It 's distracting . And , you know , talking to you is the only time I feel clear . And calm . Like I might actually get better . You are getting better . Every day . I see it , they see it , and soon you 'll see it yourself . Yeah . You know , they really should be analyzing speech patterns and tracking voice ... - Voice biometrics . - ... biometrics . Yes , Fitz , I think they are . Coulson , I don 't think we see eye-to-eye on this . My team was up to the task when they took that freak into custody , before you took me . They have him on lockdown . - That 's the problem . - How is that a problem ? You 've said in your numerous public appearances that you have a facility where you 're storing the technology and prisoners captured in the S.H.I.E.L.D. raids , yes ? Yeah . I 'm flattered you keep up with my press . What 's your point ? Creel 's after a deadly weapon stored in that facility . Here 's some more press . He targeted your family to force you to give up the location of that facility , but now he doesn 't have to . Your people just took a man they have no idea how to contain to the one place he wants to be . Now I need your help to stop him . I 'll make you a deal . You let me out of here , and I promise not to kill you . But there is no way on god 's green Earth I am ever gonna help you . Well ... you might . Son of a bitch ! This is Brigadier General Glenn Talbot , access code Delta-3-6-5-Sierra-Victor-Niner . I want double detail on that prisoner . I want the walls crawling with semi-autos , - and a vehicle at my location now ! - Uh , absolutely , sir . We 'll ... we 'll get right on that . Victor-niner . Niner . Okay . Yeah , all right . You just ... you hold tight , general . Okay , we , uh , traced the number to a spot near the Pentagon . - We are ready to go . - We have a small logic question . Why ? Why are we going in ? - Look , we trust Coulson 's judgment . - We do ? But Talbot 's not a bad guy . And last I checked , the U.S. Government is one of the lesser evils . So they 've got the weapon in a locked box . And now they 've got this absorbing man in a locked box , too . - That 's not so bad . - She 's got a point . It does seem as safe a place to keep them as any . But they have no idea what they 're dealing with . Yeah , but is that danger worse than the risk of sending every field operative you have available into a secure military compound ? Yeah , guarded by the same people that 's been hunting us . - Belly of the beast , man . - Well , we 're already on our heels . We can 't even get this thing out of the hangar . Exactly . This is a make-or-break moment . For an object we have zero data on . That 's not the only thing we 're after . Now it 's all or nothing , huh ? Well , all right , then . - You taking point ? - Coulson will be on comms . - Hey , let 's stick together on this one . - You got it . - General . - Come on , girl . You know I look good . No , they 're saying General Talbot up and vanished . Don 't know how . Think this guy might have pulled some kind of magic trick . What the ... He 's gone . Call upstairs . I have General Jones and his party here - to meet with General Talbot . - General Jones ? Sir . I 'm sorry , sir . I don 't have this visit in the register today . You might want to double-check that . Military installations bury all their cables . - Wisely . - Not that wisely . - Okay . Delta-3-6-5-Sierra-Victor ... - Niner . If it 's not in here , there 's nothing I can do . Exit to the left , please . - Gatehouse . - This is General Talbot . Why has General Jones and his government escort been delayed at the gate , soldier ? - Wave them through . - Uh , sir . Sorry , sir . His name 's not in the register , and my orders are to strictly ... - Now , you listen to me , son . - Private Tilden . - It 's Private Tilden , isn 't it ? - Yes , sir . Well , I don 't care about this register or that . I want General Jones and his friends sent directly to the ordnance depot to meet me . Hey . Hey . Go bigger . Go bigger . ... or I 'll have you so deep in horse manure , son , - You 'll need a damn snorkel . - I understand , sir , but I can 't ... Oh . Never mind ... sir . Nice work , soldier . Next time you see me , come shake my hand . - Talbot out . - What ? ! Stay and keep it running in case we have to abort . Got it . Needle in a haystack . Turns out I was not exaggerating . All right , we know what we 're looking for . Don 't we ? I 've got the 0-8-4 . Repeat ... I 've got the damn thing . Southwest side . Okay . Why don 't we find out what all the hype 's about ? No ! - What the hell 's happening ? - I can 't let go ! Okay , Hartley , just relax your hand . I can 't let go . Don 't touch it . Just stay away . They 'll be on us any second . Okay , time to go . Help me get her up . - Can you walk ? - I think so . What are you waiting for ? ! We need to get her out of here before we all get killed ! - We got what we came for ! - Not everything we came for . Wait . What are you talking about ? Coulson , Hartley has the item , but it 's attacking her . She needs medical right now . Do we abort ? Alarms have sounded . Chances of them being captured or killed here just skyrocketed . Should we just cut our losses ? Coulson ? ! Come on ! Come on ! S-sir , I repeat ... what are our orders ? Do we go dark ? Negative . Do not abort . Proceed as planned . - You heard him . - Help me up . I can follow . - Are you mental ? - We have our orders . Screw the orders . We need to get you to a doctor . - Hunter ... - No , no , stay here and die if that 's what you want to do , but I 'm making sure she doesn 't . I wish you the best of luck , really , but we 're out of here . Go ! Go ! - They 're headed to the West door ! - Move ! Move ! Go ! Go ! - Get us the hell out of here ! - You got it . - Cut it off . - What ? N-no . Okay ? We 'll get you to a hospital . They 'll fix this . This thing is killing me . I can feel it . I need you to cut it off , or I won 't make it to the hospital . It 's no big deal . You 've seen what they can - do with robotics these days . - Uh , probably be an upgrade . I don 't want to die . Okay . I know it was a risk . If we went down today , we 'd probably be down for good . But now we have a chance to survive . We have soldiers willing to sacrifice , but they need weapons . The enemy has the advantage . We need one of our own . - You risked that for a quinjet ? - No . For what we can do with one . Disappear . Become ghosts . That 's how we have to live now ... in the shadows , to save people , even when they don 't know it , don 't want it . Fitz said he could engineer cloaking , but ... I 'm afraid he can 't do anything . The damage to his temporal lobe was too extensive . He 's not the same , and ... since Simmons left , he 's only getting worse . And this is number two of five . But if we get this one finished today , there 's not much ... Simmons , I said not to touch anything . Yes , yes . I know . I know . And I have told them to be patient , like you said , but I 'm still having trouble communicating the ... the ... yes . Thank you . Sorry . Simmons said she thought he 'd be better without her here , but her leaving just broke him . In the months since , he 's grown isolated , talking to himself more and more . I know . I know . I 'm almost there . We have to fight on for him , for those we 've lost . We have to take risks ... so the sacrifices they made were not made in vain . And then ... we 'll disappear . Creel has escaped and did indeed make off with the Obelisk . He should contact us shortly . I would have him come in , but I 'm being overly discreet with this operation . I know how long you have been searching for this , Dr. Whitehall . You have no idea .

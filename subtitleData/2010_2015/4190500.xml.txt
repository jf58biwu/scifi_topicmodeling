 { FAINT CHEERING } Lets welcome our favorite alumnus , and the next senator from the state of New York , David Norris ! Thank you . Thank you . Well , hi , there . My name is David Norris , and Id like to be the next senator from the great state of New York . Look at you . Whats your name ? Im going to go through Yonkers , door to door and take the city that way . We love you . The recent endorsement by the fire fighters union is another boost to Norris who already had a six-point lead over his opponent , Roger Linfield . Whenever I see you on C-Span , and you stand , I always think youre about to go , " ´ CChug ! " ´ Congressman , you certainly started your career off , eight years ago , with a bang or should I say , a bust . For the last eight years , David Norris has represented Brooklyn , New York City and America . This is my campaign chairman , Charlie Traynor . These are voters . Latest polls have you up 10 points . Were 10 points up ? This is not going to be easy getting there . I have some real opposition , and what theyre saying about me is that Im too young to hold this office . Win big , but run like youre 20 down . Okay , you got it . Thank you , Gary . But thats okay because these are the same people who say that young people dont vote , young people dont care about politics , but Im here to tell you , your future is about your choices , not theirs . So , today Id like to put them on notice because come November , I want them to know that it was young people like you , who kicked their asses . { ALL CHEERING } David ! David ! Thank you . Charlie . Whats wrong ? { CELL PHONE RINGING } Yeah ? Any ideas ? Im working on it . Keep me posted . Yeah . David Norris , until recently , he was way ahead in the polls . Mary Matalin and James Carville are here . Mary , this is a surprise . It is a surprise . Such political promise . This compelling story , he grew up in a rough neighborhood in Brooklyn . He overcame the loss of his entire family , his mom and his brother when he was 10 , his father before he got to high school , he got over that . He had such promise . And he was the youngest person ever elected to the House of Representatives . Yeah , he was elected when he was actually 24 , but he gets in a bar room fight the night that hes elected . I like this , all right . Then you have this photo coming out of the New York Post . I think the accretion of this stuff was just too much for the voters . It reeked of some level of immaturity here , of impulsiveness . People want maturity , they want adults in Congress . Big night for us , gentlemen . Everybody ready ? You look exhausted . You should take a vacation when all this is finished . Youve earned it . Im not sure the kind of tired I am can be fixed by a vacation . Everybody needs a vacation , even us . All right , lets get him back on track . Mary , over the past couple of weeks since the photo came out , they thought people ... Why are you still watching CNN ? That it wasnt such a big deal , but clearly it was . They called this way too early . Come on . Put on your pretty little tie and lets go . { PHONE RINGING } Suffolk County numbers , Linfield , 415,120 . Norris ... 370,233 . Wow . I really thought wed win Suffolk . Kings County just came in , too . Well ... I didnt win Brooklyn . Its going to be a blow out . NBC has us up next . Im going to go work on my speech . David ... David . Hey ! Im sorry I wasted your time , Charlie . NBC news is now calling the election for Roger Linfield . After a shockingly poor showing at both Suffolk County , and his home county , Kings , it now appears David Norris will lose this election badly . Hello ? Hello ? I grew up in Red Hook , and I dont want to surprise anybody , but I got into a few fistfights along the way . Its not whether or not you get knocked down , its what you do when you get back up . Ladies and gentlemen , Im here tonight to tell you I will get back up . But tonight is not about me . It is about coming together and welcoming the newest senator for the great state of New York , Roger Linfield . { METAL CLINKS } Shit ! Shit , shit , shit . Hello ? Its the men ´ ss . Yep . Sorry about that . I didnt mean to eavesdrop . I just didnt know what to do . I heard you come in and say , ´ HHello , " ´ and I probably should have said , ´ HHi , " ´ but then I thought that would be weird because its the men ´ ss . Then you started talking to yourself and it was obviously very personal . So I was stuck in no mans land , and then it all got to be too much , so I came out . What are you doing in here ? Just ... Im hiding from security . Why ? I crashed a wedding upstairs . People still do that ? It was a dare . Who dared you to crash a wedding ? Me . Oh . I crashed a wedding once . Did you ? Yeah , in high school . Oh . But I got caught . I spent the night in jail . I think that happened more than once from what I heard . Youre that guy running for Senate , aren ´ tt you ? Yeah , I am that guy . And judging from your speech , youre not winning ? No . Oh . Thats too bad , the other guy is such a tool . He is a tool . I wish I could have made that clearer in the campaign ads . Personally , I think mooning your friends at a college reunion is no big deal . The Post did not have to run the photo . At least not a full page . God , no . { BOTH LAUGHING } It was my favorite moment of your whole campaign . Really ? I could have used you on my team a couple of months ago . I could help poll test every word that comes out of your mouth before you say it . Oh , you like politicians ? I like it when they do stuff I can relate to . Like pull their pants down ? I love that . See , that kind of candidate wouldnt even get elected to the student council . My guy would know how to tie his own tie . Its a clip-on . Oh , I wish . That would have been my other favorite moment of your campaign . Do you still have a chance ? Is it over ? He crushed me . Sorry . Well , losing has its advantages . Like what ? For one thing , as a politician , youre never really alone unless youre asleep , or in the bathroom usually . That gets old . Really ? Yeah , I guess Im mostly just looking forward to having some time by myself . I dont buy it . I think you love it . Do I know you ? { BOTH LAUGH } I guess I could have been more convincing . Okay . You dont have to worry about being convincing till the next election . Are you a registered New York voter ? Do I sound like I am ? Holy shit . David . Oh . Wow , sorry , guys . Sorry . I got to go . Sorry . Wow . Hang on . You going to give your speech ? Hang on . Hey ! Hey . Maam . I got to go . Maam ? That is so much better . Shes on the move . Southwest staircase . Excuse me ? Maam . What was that ? I dont know . Are you ready ? Yeah , yeah . All right , go do the speech . Come on . Congressman David Norris . { ALL CHEERING } I grew up not far away from here , in Red Hook . Brooklyn ! I love you , David ! I love you more ! I love you both . { ALL LAUGHING } But we had a rule in my neighborhood . When you got in a fight , it wasnt whether or not you got knocked down , its what you do when you get back up . And I came here to tell you tonight , that I will get back up . Its bullshit . We didnt have that saying in my neighborhood . Its just one of those phrases that had some traction with the focus group and so we kept using it , but its not true . In 1998 , I did a cover story for GQ . The title was ´ YYoungest Congressman Ever . " ´ And since then , every story has tried to explain how I got here so fast . And the word that people kept using was ´ aauthentic . " ´ { ALL CHEERING } But heres the problem . This isnt even my tie . Go get Jim for me . This tie was selected for me by a group of specialists in Tenafly , New Jersey who chose it over 56 other ties we tested . In fact , our data suggests that I have to stick to either a tie that is red or a tie that is blue . A yellow tie made it look as if I was taking my situation lightly , and I may in fact , pull my pants down again at any moment . { ALL LAUGHING } A silver tie meant that Id forgotten my roots . My shoes ... You know , shiny shoes , we associate with high-priced lawyers and bankers . If you want to get a working mans vote , you need to scuff up your shoes a little bit . But you cant scuff them up so much that you alienate the lawyers and the bankers because you need them to pay for the specialists back in Tenafly . So , what is the proper scuffing amount ? Do you know we actually paid a consultant $ 7,300 ... Was it $ 7,300 , Charlie ? Nice . What an asshole . $ 7,300 , for a consultant to tell us that this is the perfect amount of scuffing . { CAMERAS CLICKING } He has to spill his coffee on his shirt by 7 : 05 . 7 : 05 at the latest . III get him as soon as he enters the park . Cant imagine being on this guy as long as you have . { BREATHING DEEPLY } { ALARM BEEPING } ... for energy efficient technologies . RSR Venture Capital announced yesterday that former Congressman David Norris , would become a senior partner . Norris led an unsuccessful bid for Senate last month . But his concession speech was considered , by many , to be electrifying and has made him the obvious front runner in the 2010 Senate race . Investment banker Charles Traynor founded RSR , { PHONE RINGING } one of the countrys most successful venture capital firms . Traynor is a childhood friend of Norris and was the Chairman of his Senate campaign . Hey ! Hey . Tom FrankeI from The Journal is calling you in five minutes . I just gave him this number . Give him 3-2-2-7 . Im not used to this phone yet . No , I cant . He ´ ss going to ask you about joining the firm . All business calls have to be done on a company Blackberry . Really ? Sarbanes-Oxley , you voted for it , paI . In fact , you co-sponsored that one . Yeah , I remember . Hey , I just saw you on TV . Really ? Yeah . What did they say ? Youre bald . Nice . Yeah , it was weird , too , because it was a financial show . But they were really captivated by your receding hairline . I got to go , you jack-off . Bye . Congressman . I have to tell you , I really admire what you did last month . Thank you . I appreciate it . I wish there were more politicians like you . Thank you . Im retired now . I had to go get a real job . YouII do well . Thank you . { INHALES SHARPLY } Hey ! You got a guy running for the bus . There is another M6 right behind me . Hey ! No way . Sorry . Oh , my God . Have we met ? You look vaguely familiar . Waldorf mens room . You got it . Were you just staring at my legs while I slept ? I was defenseless against the small dress . Its a skirt . Its a belt . { ELISE LAUGHING } What is it with you and the argyle ? What is the deal with you and the boring shades of blue ? My clothes match . Did your team pick that out for you ? No team . Team is gone . Wow . I did it all by myself . I saw your speech . Yeah , the speech . Something must have got into me . { CELL PHONE RINGING } Wow , that is something . Really augments the moment . Nice ring , asshole . Hello ? Hello ? It doesnt even work . Could that ringer get louder or do you have that maxed out ? Its a new phone . Are you going to run again ? Dont know . I ´ mm starting a new job today . You have to run again . You cant do that . The country will end up being run by tools like Linfield . It kind of is . Oh , shit . { DAVID AND ELISE EXCLAIM } Sorry . I dont know what just happened . Are you okay ? Im fine . Can you hand me that ? You sure you okay ? Yeah . III pay for the dry cleaning . No , it ´ ss really fine . Please dont . Wow . Seven bucks will probably cover it . You keep that , you might need it . You know what ? Here . You write your number down then I can call you and come pick up your skirt . Oh , my goodness , me . That is very smooth . Oh , shit . Why dont you let me spill some on you and then we ´ III be even ? Thats a terrible idea . I think it ´ ss a great idea . Just one bit because thats not fair . You actually are crazy . No , now it all makes sense . { PHONE RINGING } Okay , hang on . Oh , jeez . Hes not here . I know , I ´ mm sorry . Who was that ? I dont know . Who cares ? ItII be on the ... Can you just ... No . Okay , now were in the third grade . This is great . { CELL PHONE RINGING } Its a sturdy little fucker , isn ´ tt it ? Im sorry . I don ´ tt know what happened , it just happened . Okay . Okay , that was a new phone . Lets wipe it off . Im Elise , by the way . III remember that . { CARS HONKING } Thats my number . Terrific , thank you . III call you . The morning after the election , I woke up thinking about you . Hey , man , whats up ? Youre not going to believe who I just ran into . Who ? The girl from election night . The one you kissed ? She kissed me . You still sticking with that story ? Its the truth . Whatever , dude . Theyre ready for you in the main conference room . What are the odds ? Its amazing . Thats great , man , just don ´ tt take her advice on speeches anymore . First time worked , its not going to work again . Youre just jealous because it ´ ss the best speech I ever gave and you didnt write it . Just so you know , I think Im coming down against your solar panel thing . Why ? I just dont think the research is there and the price point is too high on these things . Of course , its too high . But if our company doesnt get involved with stuff like this , who will ? Convince me in the meeting . I will . See you , buddy . Hey , Janet . Hey , Susan . We just got approval for a recalibration on the Lasalle case . Two minutes . { PHONE CONVERSATION REPLAYING } Hey ! What the hell are you doing ? Grab him . 9-1-1 , Janet ! 9-1-1 ! Oh . You cant get away , David . David , I really wish youd just listen to me . All right , III handle it . { ENGAGED TONE } David , you really are making this harder than it has to be . All right , take it easy , guys . Take it easy . Take it easy . Its okay , David . No . No , sir . Its being taken care of . Yes , sir . Its being taken care of . Yes , sir . No , sir . No , sir . Yes , sir . I understand . III take care of it . What a goddamn mess . Donaldson ? Yes . McCRADY : What do you want to do ? We have to reset him . Call for a briefcase . McCRADY : You kidding ? Its going to take a signed order from the Chairman . Get legal on it . legal just arrived . Theres no way the Chairman approves a reset . This is your fault . There is no way you get a briefcase . Hey . What are my options ? Hey . Just bullshit him . Bullshit this guy ? Hey ! Whats going on here ? Look at this . Questions will burn in him till the day he dies . He wont stop searching for answers . He won ´ tt quit . We have to watch him forever , make sure he doesnt talk . Endless ripple effects . You remember the Torres case 40 years ago ? Its not that bad , is it ? In the end , they just leveled with him . Completely ? Looking at that , I dont see you have a choice . Who the hell are you guys ? We are the people who make sure things happen according to plan . My name is Richardson . Oh . You really think I couldnt see that coming ? I can read your mind . Yeah , really . Pick a color . Blue . Pick a number . Seventeen . Now , why are you still thinking about running ? I dont really know what ´ ss going on here . Youve just seen behind a curtain that you werent supposed to know existed . Must be jarring . Its not your fault . Your path through the world this morning was supposed to have been adjusted . You were supposed to spill your coffee as you entered the park this morning . You would have gone upstairs to change , you would have missed the bus , and you would have arrived at work 10 minutes later than you did , and we would have been gone . I was supposed to spill my coffee ? We call that an adjustment . See , sometimes , when people spill their coffee or their Internet goes out or they misplaced their keys , they think its chance . And sometimes it is . Sometimes its us ... { TIRES SQUEALING } ... nudging people back on plan . Sometimes when nudging isnt enough , management authorizes a recalibration . We deploy our Intervention Team and they change your mind for you , like we did with your friend Charlie . Hes fine , by the way . You dont need to worry about him . Now ... There is something I need you to understand if Im going to let you go . Okay . Very few humans have seen what youve seen today , and were determined to keep it that way . So , if you ever reveal our existence , well erase your brain . The Intervention Team will reset you . Your emotions , your memories , your entire personality will be expunged . Your friends and family will think youve gone crazy . You wont think anything . You understand ? Not one word about us . Okay . Oh , one more thing , you bumped into a woman this morning on the bus . Elise ? What does that have to do with anything ? You were never supposed to see her again . What does that matter ? Because it matters . McCRADY : Its in his wallet . Hey , hey . God ! Hey ! Whats with you guys ? Jesus ! Oh , come on . No ! No ! What the hell ? Really ? What the hell ? Okay . Okay . Take him back . Enjoy the rest of your day . I can walk . Im capable of walking . Dude , what are you doing on my floor ? You know , I called you like 10 times , you could have picked up . Christine , I found him . Hes in my office . What the hell are you doing ? Round up the guys , were going to do the meeting now . You have a headache ? What is wrong with you ? Hey , were in the big conference room on 17 . Let ´ ss go . Morning , Congressman . You sure youre okay ? Yeah , you ? Im great , why ? You dont have a headache or anything ? No , I feel fantastic , man . Is it me or this an odd conversation ? On Davids solar panel deal , our tech guy has serious doubts about the efficiency ratings theyre claiming . Theyd need a 20-fold improvement over anything anyone else has been able to manufacture at that price point to really be a game-changer . Youre opposed to this anyway , Charlie . And with these financials ... Whoa , whoa . I know its a risk , but if our company doesnt take a chance on something like this , then who will ? I mean , Im willing to take a fire on something that could change the world . Not to mention , be incredibly lucrative . David ? Yeah , I mean , its why I took the job here . All right . Lets do it . Come into my office for a second . Something is wrong . A couple of hours ago you miraculously reunite with the girl of your dreams . Explain to me why you dont have an ear-to-ear grin right now . I lost her number . What ? The woman on the bus . I lost her phone number and all I had was her first name , so , Im never going to see her again . Im sorry . Wow , Im really sorry . Your entire world is turned upside down and youre thinking about a woman . Even if you could remember the number , youll never get through . Lost cell phone , changed numbers , whatever creates the fewest ripples . My name is Harry , by the way . The fewest ripples ? You freeze people . You froze my friend . We need special authorization to ... Poke around in peoples brains . You make them think whatever you want ... Be quiet , David . Can I get you something ? Just some water , please . Your friend will be fine . Recalibrations make tiny changes in the way people reason . It doesnt work on emotion or personality . Thats too intrusive . You said authorization . Authorization from who ? The Chairman . The Chairman ? Thats just a name we use . You use many other names . We cant talk here . Meet me on the 4 : 00 p. m. boat and III answer what I can . If you reveal us , even if its unintentional ... I know . YouII bump me on the head . Richardson has automatic authority to reset you . You mean lobotomize me ? Try not to forget it . Be on the 4 : 00 p. m. boat . Ask your questions , III tell you what I can . What were they doing to Charlie ? Just changing the way he weighs investment risks which will subtly shift the direction of his company in the way upstairs wants . So , Richardson could read my mind ? Richardson was trying to scare you . No , he knew the number I was thinking of , the color . Because he set it up as a choice . ´ CChoose a color , choose a number . " ´ We cant read your mind or hear your thoughts . When you make a decision , your mind weighs options . We can perceive them . We know when youre going to go off the plan or not because if were close enough , we can sense when its going to happen . Were just here to keep you on plan . Thats all we ´ rre authorized to do . Are you allowed to be telling me this stuff ? Are they following me now ? We have to monitor the entire world . We dont have the manpower to follow everyone all the time . And there is something about water . It blocks our ability to read your decision tree . Are you an angel ? Weve been called that . Were more like case officers who live a lot longer than humans . Why are you helping me ? I have my reasons . And why wont they let me be with Elise ? AII I know is the amount of resources theyve used keeping you from her is pretty damn important to them . Youre going to look for her , aren ´ tt you ? You wont find her . TheyII make sure of it . Even if they werent trying to stop you , there are nine million people in this city . Youll never find her . Forget about her . Move on with your life . { ALARM BEEPING } Stop ! Stop the bus ! Elise ? Elise , hi . David . You know , I rode the M6 to work every day for three years hoping that Id bump into you . Listen , is there a place we could go and talk ? Dont you have to get to work or something ? I just got sick . ´ II haven ´ tt seen you in three years , you make me sick . " ´ Thats not an ideal come-on , just so you know . What are you looking for ? { CELL PHONE RINGING } I felt like someone was watching us . Hey , Charlie , Im going to have to skip breakfast , and I probably have to postpone the speech , too . I just bumped into Elise . You just hung up on your friend . Weve known each other since we were kids . What speech ? It doesnt matter . You want to take a walk ? No . We have a lot to catch up on . I dont think you should cancel your speech . What if I dont like you at the end of our walk ? III take my chances . Seriously , my number hasnt changed , just call me like you didnt last time . Look , if you take a walk with me , III explain why . Its been years . How do you know I don ´ tt have a nice boyfriend ? Do you have a nice boyfriend ? Would it matter if I did ? Yeah . So you dont have any real conviction then ? Okay , it wouldnt matter at all . So , you dont mind being a home-wrecker ? Congressman ! How are you doing , man ? Im from Red Hook . You ´ rre the best . Thank you . Good to see you . If you were married , then it would bother me . But now youre just saying what you think I want to hear . Im single . Now lets hear your bullshit excuse for not calling me . I didnt have your number . I gave it you on the bus . Handed it to you . I was mugged . It was taken from me . No , come on . My wallet was taken . Come on . Why else would I fawn all over you on a bus three years ago and then never call you ? Because , I dont know ! You have a girlfriend and you felt terrible . Listen , I swear to you that I did not have your number . All right . No , on my parents graves . Thats heavy . Thats too heavy , I know , but it ´ ss true . I didnt have your number . And I didnt even have a last name to go by . If you google just ´ EEIise , " ´ you get 757,000 hits . You did not . And none of them are you . We have a problem . What ? David Norris is off plan . Son of a bitch . How did he find her ? Chance . Just spotted her on the street . We never should have let him meet her in the first place . We followed protocol to the letter . Guy rides the same bus every day for three years . Who does that ? Three years later , Im still cleaning up your mess . Lets cut the power at her dance studio . Im a dancer . Oh . Not like that , you pervert . Im in a contemporary ballet company . I think you have the wrong idea about me . No , I think that was the first thing that crossed your mind , actually . I think you should invite me to one of your performances . The company is called Cedar Lake , and there is actually a show tomorrow night , if you want . Is that an invitation ? No , its information . Were covering the girl ´ ss artistic director and were still working on Charlie Traynor . This whole thing will be over in an hour . Hi , how are you ? paul , right ? How did you remember that ? Im a politician , I ´ mm good with names . Her decision tree is diverging from our models . Its just the two of you ? Yes . Thirty-six hours without contact , shell never speak to him again . Look at her file . Its the last thing in the world she ´ III put up with . No , somethings wrong . I ´ mm already seeing inflection points . { RICHARDSON SIGHING } You okay ? Yeah . Were in motion on changing the location of her rehearsal . You have to be born with the right body like very flexible hips and shoulders and long neck . And you werent ? No , I was . I was lucky . But after 15 years of that precision and the training ... How is everything over here ? Its great . Thank you . Its good , thank you . So , I wanted to try something else just on my own , open-ended and human , I guess . What do you mean ? Look . Whats this ? If they kiss . A kiss ? Thats all it takes ? A real kiss . If that happens , every possible adjustment strong enough to break them up will cause ripples over your limit . I think that everything you go through in life should come out in the way that you dance . I havent found that to be the case with my dancing . Its a shame . David , hate to interrupt . Hi . Hi , nice to see you again , Elise . How did you find me ? Does it matter ? Nice work . Theres a crowd of people waiting for your announcement speech at the Brooklyn Bridge right now . Youre announcing today ? You can ´ tt skip this for me . I know . I told you Im not going to let you out of my sight . David , what the hell ? Do you want to come ? Do you want to watch ? No . I cant , I have to go and rehearse . Actually , I just heard that theyre moving my rehearsal to Pier 17 , right next to the bridge . Why dont we just postpone it ? We ´ III do the speech another time . No , David , come on , you cant do that . Thank you . You have to go . Check . David , shes rehearsing so close . ItII take you three minutes to get there after the speech . All right . Just come over when youre done . Keep the change . Thank you . Have Charlies aide call him now . { CELL PHONE RINGING } Are you sure you dont want a ride ? No , I have to go home and change . Youre so late . Your friend is about to cry . Im wrangling him right now . Yeah , I know . Shifting her rehearsal to Pier 17 was a genius move . Were not out of the woods yet . Come over when youre done . David . Okay . Sorry , the TV crew is there . We got to go , man . Were okay . { SIGHING IN RELIEF } Look , whatever happens , Im not going to let anything come between us again . Okay . III see you soon . { PEOPLE CHEERING } Hey , how you doing ? Thank you . Appreciate it . How are you ? Thanks a lot . Good to see you , too . Thank you . I have to say , its good to be back in Brooklyn . Theres been a lot of speculation as to whether or not ... McCRADY : Its done . ... I would run for a Senate seat here in the state of New York . I came here today to put an end to that speculation and to tell you , unequivocally , I will seek the Senate seat for the great state of New York . { ALL CHEERING } David ! David ! { CELL PHONE CHIMES } Shit . Dont forget , I added the bankers ´ group after The Daily Show tomorrow . Are you listening to me ? David ? I cannot get a break on this case . Okay . I got to get to Pier 17 . Do the interview and you can do whatever you want . Just handle the interviews for me . III talk to those guys ... This has got to go on the nightly news . I got to see Elise right now . Every time we get close , you do something to mess this up . This is different . City , please ? Manhattan . What listing ? Cedar Lake . Its a dance company . Connecting . Hes going to ask the parking attendant to use the hard line . I already killed it . Excuse me , can I use your phone ? I have an emergency . { ENGAGED TONE BEEPING } McCRADY : Restaurant across the street . Mmm-hmm . I took out everything for three blocks . This guy is a pain in the ass . Come on , lets go talk to him . There is a whole world of women out there . I thought we established this one was off limits . Its been a while , I must have forgotten . Doesnt change the fact . You put us together three times . That wasnt us , that was just chance . Why do you want to keep us apart ? Because the plan says so . Then you misread the plan . There is no misreading the plan when it comes to you and Elise . Then the plan is wrong . Do you know who wrote it ? I dont care . You should . You should really show a little respect . If Im not supposed to be with her , how come I feel like this ? It doesnt matter how you feel . What matters is what is in black and white . You dont know why I ´ mm not supposed to be with her , do you ? Thats why you can ´ tt tell me . You don ´ tt know . Who is this guy ? Uh-oh . Excuse me , everyone . Sorry to disturb your lunch . Its an emergency . Has anyone here ever seen a performance at the Cedar Lake Ballet Company ? The Cedar Lake Ballet Company ? Yeah , I have . Where is it ? Son of a bitch . Hey , taxi . Hey ! Taxi ! Hey ! { VEHICLES HONKING } Taxi ! Maybe you should try the subway . Dont all these taxies you ´ rre diverting have plans , too ? How long you going to keep that up ? Twenty minutes ? An hour ? Wow , the ripples must just be endless . I dont care what you put in my way , I ´ mm not giving up . Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Taxi ! Hey ! You all right ? You okay ? What happened ? You got hit . Are you okay ? I think so . Dont move . You all right ? Hello , I just witnessed an accident on the corner of Water and Dover Street . Unfortunately , youre the only witness , Congressman . But we did this three times already . I just need a few more details . Oh , I see . Youre not even a cop , are you ? You ´ rre one of them . Calm down . Okay . Someone could have been killed . Sir , if you would just calm down . Hey , Sergeant . Hi . Sorry , excuse me , I know you need a statement from me , but do I need to stay here or can I do it over the phone ? No , sir , we know how to get in touch with you . Okay . Now , is this man under your command ? Never mind . Thank you . Hey , hey , hey ! You want to make a quick 100 bucks ? Youre going to have to break a couple of traffic laws . All right , 26th and 10th . Its a ballet company called Cedar Lake . Go through that . Look out ! Watch it . This is going to keep happening , just go through . Son of a bitch ! Set a traffic jam on Broadway . Too many ripples . Hes getting out of range . I dont know what to do with this . You ´ rre reaching your limit . Hey ! Excuse me . Two down . Two down . Oh , shit ! Next one . I hate downtown . Sorry . Ive got inflection points . All he needs to do is see her dance and youre at your ripple limit . What ? All right , block the door . Hes already through it . Not that one , the next one . Excuse me . David Norris , Im here to see Elise . Im blocking them all . Hat ! Hat ! Is she here ? Yeah , shes in the studio . McCRADY : Its too late . He ´ ss already seen her . You hit your ripple limit . Celebrate now . Theyre just going to kick it upstairs . { CELL PHONE RINGING } Its Donaldson . He has no idea what hes up against . { EXHALING HEAVILY } Lets take a walk . The intense chemistry between them , the constant inflection points , and the kicker , you pulling them apart twice only to have chance put them back together . Yeah , all that seemed a little much . So , I asked Burdensky to do some research this morning . Have you been in here before ? No , of course not . It seems like David Norris and Elise Sellas were meant to be together because they were meant to be together . Wait , what ? In the 70s when he was born , they were meant to be together , same thing in the 80s , ´ 990s . Wasnt till 2005 that the plan changed and she was supposed to stay with Adrian . The problem here is there are remnants from all those old plans that keep pushing them together . They still feel like they belong with each other even though they dont , and were about to tear them apart again . You spend your whole career hoping , someday , youll get a red-letter case . Something you can really make a name for yourself with . Finally you get one , and its booby-trapped . What ? Im saying , it wasn ´ tt your fault . They were meant to be together . What ? Were . In an earlier version of the plan . Actually , a dozen earlier versions . I always wondered how we had such bad luck that she was on that particular bus on that particular day . How could a plan just change like that ? I dont know . Its above my pay grade . So , were going operational . This is exciting . Its been a while . Were not going operational . No one ever made it to my job by taking stupid risks . So , what are we going to do ? Were going to kick this case upstairs to someone with the latitude to clean up this mess without breaking into a sweat . Were going to bring this to Thompson . Thompson ? When he was in the field , his nickname was ... ´ TThe Hammer , " ´ yes . hell crush this little romance with a flick of his hand and force them back on plan again . I want to go to a club . Oh ! Why ruin a really nice day ? Come on . No , I dont dance . Everyone can dance . You just feel the music . Well , Ive been told that I have trouble feeling . Who told you that ? A long list of women . Thats gross . You know what ? Lets race to that lamppost . You win , I dance for you . I win , you dance for me . On the pole ? If you like , yeah . This is serious . What are the rules ? There are no rules . Oh ! You bastard ! Oh , my gosh ! { BOTH LAUGHING } You challenged me in those shoes ? Okay , fine . I cant . Youre right . These are the wrong shoes . I ´ mm going to twist an ankle . You said , ´ NNo rules . " ´ I avoided them . Ow ! You said you had trouble feeling . Great . Hey , David . Youre even cuter in person . Hey , its David Norris . How you doing ? How are you ? How are we feeling about this tie ? Hey , David Norris ! Hey , how you doing ? Maybe I should go home and get my tux . Definitely dont do that . It ´ ss good . I should never have come back here again without my backup dancers . I voted for you . How are you ? { PEOPLE CHEERING } Norris , youre a rock star ! Did you grow up over here ? Yeah , three blocks over that way . Pioneer Street . My whole childhood . What were you like as a kid ? Ive spent about half my time in the principal ´ ss office up until the sixth grade . Wow . Yeah , that was when my mother and my brother died within a month of each other . Im sorry . No , its fine . You know how I always tell that story about how I got inspired to go into politics because my dad took me to the Senate Gallery and we sat together and thats true . But what I leave out is he did that right after they died . And I was bottoming out . So , he wanted to get me out of here for a little while and he planned this road trip to DC , and I think its because JFK was his idol . And we went and sat in the gallery . I remember watching him watch them , and I knew that thats what I wanted to do . I wish they were here to see all this . I was ... Didnt expect to tell you any of that . David ? David ? { CELL PHONE BUZZING } Hello ? Its Adrian . Hey . { DOOR OPENING } What are you doing ? Why are you calling ? Hi . No , I was ... Because I was sleeping . No . No , its not . Why are you calling ? Okay , well , I got to go . No , I got to go . Okay . Im so sorry . Its all right . Everything okay ? Yeah . Oh , my God . That was so weird . I woke up and you werent here . And then the phone rang and it was my ex which is just so strange . Sorry , I guess we hadnt gotten to any of that stuff yet . Right . You know , we broke up a while ago , and its over and then he calls four times in one morning . He called you four times this morning ? Mmm-hmm . How long have you guys been broken up ? Um ... Three months . Its like he knew I was with someone else . Was it serious ? We were engaged . So , not really that serious ? Right . Well , what happened ? { EXHALES HEAVILY } Do you want to know this ? Yeah . He was a great guy . Brilliant choreographer and dancer , and we had the same group of friends . We had known each other a long time . Well , he sounds great . Why didnt you marry him ? Because of you . Im not some hopeless romantic . Ive never allowed myself to be that way . But once I felt , even for a moment , what I felt with you . You ruined me . I didnt want to settle for less . I know the feeling . It scares the shit out of me . Im not going to hurt you . You dont need to say that . Im not going to hurt you . This is the first time in 25 years that I dont feel like I ´ mm by myself . Thats a lot of responsibility for me . I dont know if I ´ mm quite comfortable with that . Well , too late . You know , Im supposed to go to an interview right now . What if I told you I wasnt ready to let you out of my sight quite yet ? Sounds good . You want to go ? Yeah . All right . Are you handsome or is it that Washington is so populated by I dont want to say , hideous abnormalities ... This is getting a little weird . { STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHING } David Norris , everybody . Excuse me , maam . Yes ? Congressman Norris asked me to give you a message . He was just called into a meeting . He says its urgent . Okay . He said hell call you as soon as he ´ ss out and hell see you at the show tonight . Okay , thank you . Thanks . This way , Congressman . Hello ? Frustrating , isnt it ? My name is Thompson . Whatever happened to free will ? We actually tried free will before . After taking you from hunting and gathering to the height of the Roman Empire , we stepped back to see how you would do on your own . You gave us the Dark Ages for five centuries until finally we decided we should come back in . The Chairman thought that maybe we just needed to do a better job with teaching you how to ride a bike before taking the training wheels off again . So , we gave you the Renaissance , the Enlightenment , scientific revolution . For 600 years we taught you to control your impulses with reason . Then in 1910 , we stepped back again . Within 50 years , you had brought us World War I , the Depression , Fascism , the Holocaust , and capped it off by bringing the entire planet to the brink of destruction in the Cuban missile crisis . At that point a decision was taken to step back in again before you did something that even we couldnt fix . You dont have free will , David . You have the appearance of free will . You expect me to believe that ? I make decisions every day . You have free will over which toothpaste you use or which beverage to order at lunch . But humanity just isnt mature enough to control the important things . So , you handle the important things ? The last time I checked , the world is a pretty screwed-up place . Its still here . If we had left things in your hands , it wouldnt be . Tell me why I cant be with Elise ? Because the last guy didnt know . Meeting Elise at the Waldorf three years ago wasnt chance . That was us . We knew she would inspire you to give that speech . That speech that brought you back from the edge of oblivion and overnight made you the frontrunner in this coming election . What are you saying ? You want me to win the election ? This one and four more after it . And Im not just talking about elections for Senate . You can matter , David . Really matter . What your father wanted when he took you to the Senate Gallery when you were 10 . What your brother wanted when he made you promise the day before he overdosed that you wouldnt be like him . Why do you think you have that yearning to be in front of people ? That terrible emptiness when youre not . Dont do that . David , you can change the world , but that doesnt happen if you stay with her . Why do you people care who I love ? Its not about her , it ´ ss about you . What being with her does to you . What it does to me ? Im better when I ´ mm with her ! Even you said it . The speech . In small doses , Elise was the cure . But in large doses , she rubs off on you . Stop . David , the president cant be a loose cannon . Stop talking . Its not working . Why do you refuse to accept what should be completely obvious by now ? Youve seen what we can do . You cant doubt we are who we say we are . Look , its not about who you are , it ´ ss about who I am . Cant outrun your fate , David . I just disagree with you about what my fate is . I know what I feel for her and its not going to change . AII I have are the choices that I make . And I choose her come what may . Its 6 : 20 . If you leave now , you can make Elises show . { DOOR OPENING } { TRIBAL MUSIC PLAYING } { SLOW MUSIC PLAYING } Shes a beautiful dancer . I thought I made myself clear . There is one more piece to this I havent mentioned . I guess I just didnt have the heart . If you stay with her , it not only kills your dreams , it kills hers . What ? Elise is about to become one of the most famous dancers in the country and eventually one of the worlds greatest choreographers . If she stays with you , she ends up teaching dance to six-year-olds . When you look back at all this , David , just remember we tried to reason with you . { GASPING IN PAIN } { MACHINERY WHIRRING } I always hear people saying , ´ YYou can ´ tt blame yourself for what happens to other people , " ´ but in this case , really , you can . This is what you do , David . This is what you did getting into a bar fight the night you first got elected . What you did to get that embarrassing photo in The New York Post . We give you opportunities other people would kill for and you squander them with impulse . It doesnt take a genius to see Elise isnt exactly helping you with this . Its a sprain , David , but if you stay with her , youll take away the only thing she ever cared about . Its up to you . Its just a sprain . Yeah . The doctor said its going to be better in a month or less . Thats totally unexpected . Im so relieved . Great . Great . Youre such a great dancer , and youll heal up and just get better and better . Im going to go make a couple phone calls . Okay . Okay . Im so happy for you . Its done . Thompson finished it . I know . You cant let it get to you like it did with his family . This is the job . You ever wonder if its right ? I mean , if its always right ? Not like I used to . Look , Chairman has the plan . We only see part of it . I was talking to some friends of ours over in Monroe County this morning , and I said something to them that I think a lot of you may have heard me say before but it bears repeating . David Norris , who has spent the last two days campaigning in the Tri-Lakes area received some welcome news yesterday when the latest New York Times poll gave him a 16-point lead over his opponent less than a month before election day . Since his announcement 11 months ago , Norris has had a significant lead ... Hi . Thanks . Thanks a lot . Yeah , thank you . I need it . Thank you . Who should I make it out to ? My nephew , Miles . There you go . Thank you so much . Yeah , yeah , yeah , sure . Thank you . My pleasure . Pleasure . Can we get a picture with you ? Sure , come on . Thank you . Thanks . Hey . I want to show you this , because you would find out eventually . I want to be here when you do . Shes getting married to that guy she was engaged to . You okay ? I think Im going to ... Take a day off . Hell , take a couple . Were 16 points up . Yeah , even I cant blow a lead that big . Congressman , good to see you again . Your friend just left you this . He said you would be stopping by . Why would you want to see me ? Thompson was Iying when he said you couldnt be with Elise because she brings out your reckless side . Then why ? Why do they care so much ? Because shes enough , David . If you have her , you wont need to fill that void inside of you with applause and votes and dreams of one day making it to the White House . Thats important , but it ´ ss not the only thing that matters . Why are you so different from them ? Your dad was a very smart man . He could have been a lot more . Wanted to be . Your brother , too . But the plan didnt call for it . What about my mother ? That wasnt me . That wasnt us at all . It was just chance ? Im sorry . You know , Thompson is not lying . Theyre already talking about me being a presidential candidate . Im phoning in my speeches and I ´ mm 16 points up . The public loves you . Before I met Elise , thats all I cared about . I dont even notice it now . I cant stop thinking about her . Do you know where shes getting married ? In front of a judge tomorrow morning . Is she happy ? Thompson wont let you anywhere near her . Not tonight , not tomorrow , not ever . Harry . Is she happy ? I got to try and get her back . Will you help me ? Will you just help me get to her ? TheyII sense you coming a mile away . What if I could move as fast as you ? Teach me about the doors . The rain will stop in the next hour , and thats the only thing keeping them from seeing us right now . If were going to do this , we ´ III need all night to do it and a place surrounded by water to do it in . Always turn the doorknob clockwise . What happens if I turn it the other way ? You dont want to do that . That ´ ss only for us . Put your hand on my shoulder and dont let go until we cross the threshold . Are these ever locked ? Not when youre wearing one of our hats . Keep moving , David . Is this ... Its the Museum of Modern Art . Yeah . Close the door . This is the citys main pumping station for downtown Manhattan . Were 10 blocks from the courthouse . Wait here . Hi , is the floor open ? You okay , sweetie ? Yeah , I just ... I just feel like being on the floor . Lower Manhattan is layer upon layer of substrate . Thats what we call the doors that have been added over time . Makes it a lot more complex to navigate downtown than it is uptown and a lot slower . Your destination , 60 Centre Street , Courtroom 300 . There are thousands of different ways to get to the courthouse using the doors . I want you to learn how to stay in the substrate so Thompson wont be able to get a fix on you . Okay . Just south of the diner , its a red door . I come out on Broadway , right by Leonard Street . Thats good . Keep going . From Leonard , half a block down . Okay , suppose Thompsons there ? Okay , I go east to Lafayette . No , its Crosby Street there . Eight doors ? Im zigzagging all over the place . That will take me too long . But every time you go through a door , their plan books will lose track of you , so its safer . Look , I need you to understand this has never been done before . So , the minute you go through that first door , all hell will break loose . Assume everyone with a hat on is a threat . I dont care if it ´ ss a Yankee cap , a bowler , or even a yarmulke . Assume everyone in a hat is working with Thompson . Even you guys cant get through the doors without your hats on , right ? Right . Its one of the ways the Chairman limits our power . Water is another way . And you said before , what if Thompsons in front of me on Crosby Street ? Right . Why dont I just knock the hat off his head and then run by him before he has time to pick it up ? Thats good , improvisation . We have trouble with that . The fastest way is actually if I go right for the blue door . Yeah , but then youre exposed the entire way there . Thats a lot more dangerous than leapfrogging through doors . But if I make it , III take them completely by surprise . If you make it . Come on , we have a lot more to get through . Whatever it takes . Your father used to say that . I guess youre not supposed to identify with your subjects . Youre not supposed to feel guilt . Were not built to lead with our emotions like you are , but that doesnt mean we don ´ tt have them . Some more than others . { RAIN PATTERING } Youre lucky , it started raining again . We need to get going . The wedding is in 10 minutes . We have time . Being early is just as bad as being late . Is your fiancee here ? Shes on her way in . Courtroom 300 . You okay ? Yeah . This is it . Okay . Im going to go for the blue door . Of course . Here is your way through it . Dont lose it . Thanks , Harry . Good luck . Okay . It looks like Mr. Norris is using the rain to make a run for it . Call the proctor at the wedding . Whats wrong ? Nothing . I ´ mm just nervous , I guess . I just need a minute in the bathroom , okay ? Sir , hes got a hat . He ´ ss in the substrate . He just went into the substrate . Whoa , whoa . No , no , no . Its an emergency . Sorry . Docket number 22 , please come forward . Were next . Will you go check on her ? Yeah . Youre David Norris ! Yeah , I got to go . Nothing in the hat . Go ahead . Shes not even in there . Where is she ? Where is she ? Elise . Youre not marrying that guy . Im so sorry , and I dont know what you must think of me , but you can ´ tt marry him . You dont love him . I ´ vve been terrible , I know . Im getting married . No , you can ´ tt . Dont touch me ! What are you doing ? Do you know that no one has ever hurt me as much as you did ? Im so sorry that I left you the way that I did . David , you know what ? You left me in a fucking hospital . What are you doing ? I know it seems terrible but there was a reason . You dont know anything about me and what makes me happy . Im sorry that I hurt you . Oh , my God . Dont worry about him , he ´ ss with them . Just listen to me . Oh , my God , what did you do ? Forget about him . What are you doing ? Look at me , I know that you love me . Okay , this says that you love me and that I love you and that were not supposed to be together . Because of this book . But I know that Im supposed to be with you because of the way I feel . I love you and I dont care what happens . I want to spend the rest of my life with you even if its only a little while . He just revealed us . Call the Intervention Team . Tell them its a square-one reset . Mr. Thompson has deployed the Intervention Team . Hes requesting an emergency Reset Authorization . III carry it in . Why are they chasing you ? Theyre going to reset me . What are you talking about ? I never lied to you . Down here . Hes down here . I love you , Elise . Im going to show you something . You deserve to know . Whats going on ? We got to keep moving . There is another door here . Got them . Sixth Avenue . Contain this . Oh , my God . Whats happening to me ? All you need to know , were being chased . I need you to trust me . Okay . Okay , come on . Door , door , door ! Find another door ! What the hell is going on ? What the hell is going on , David ? Okay , Im sorry . How did we just do that ? Im so sorry . These doors belong to the people who are chasing us . Who are they ? I dont know what to call them , but they want to take you away from me . Why do they care about us ? They hurt your ankle , Elise . Everything youve worked for your entire life , it doesnt happen if you stay with me . Thats why I left you in the hospital . I dont understand . I dont understand . This cant be wrong . This cant be wrong . Why do they think its wrong ? The book ... Their book . But what if I can find who wrote it ? Okay , I can go through this door alone . YouII never see me or the people chasing us again . Or you could come with me , and I dont know what ´ ss on the other side , but I know you would be next to me , and thats all I ´ vve wanted since the minute I met you . Im coming with you . Okay . Take the other one . Turn it to the left . To the left . Oh , my God . Hey ! You cant be in here . Stop , sir ! Hold them up ! Come on . Stop them ! Harry Mitchell , they want you in the Chairmans office . Immediately . Come on . Hey ! Hey ! How did you get in here ? Search the room ! Shit ! Go back . No . Oh , my God . I love you . I love you . Did you really think you could reach the Chairman ? And change your fate if you did ? Or write your own ? It doesnt work like that and I told you why . Ive got a message for you . I understand . Even Thompson has a boss . Harry ? Youre the Chairman ? No . Youve met him though , or her . Everybody has . The Chairman comes in a different form to everyone so people rarely realize when it happens . Is this some sort of test ? In a way , its all a test , for everybody , even the members of the Adjustment Bureau . David , you risked everything for Elise . And Elise , when you came through that door at the Statue of Liberty , you risked everything , too . But you inspired me . It seems like you inspired the Chairman , too . Is that about us ? Yes . What does it say ? It says that this situation between the two of you is a serious deviation from the plan . So , the Chairman rewrote it . Okay . Now what ? Now ... You can take the stairs . Most people live life on the path we set for them . Too afraid to explore any other . But once in a while , people like you come along who knock down all the obstacles we put in your way . People who realize free will is a gift youll never know how to use until you fight for it . I think thats the Chairman ´ ss real plan that maybe one day we wont write the plan . You will .

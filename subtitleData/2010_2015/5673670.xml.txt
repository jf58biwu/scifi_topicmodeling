Please allow me to stay here just for tonight . What is this ? Ahcha , Gahcha , are you comfortable here ? Ahcha , Gahcha , Make yourself feel like home . My umbrella has been broken . Ahcha , Gahcha It 's broken and pretty useless . Ahcha , Gahcha We 'll have to toss it to the trash . Ahcha , Gahcha , straight to the trash . Wow , such rare umbrellas we got here . But all of them are broken . Huh ? Ahcha , Gahcha , Ahcha , Gahcha . I gotta go . Gotta go ! Gotta go ! They are very pretty , isn 't it ? They are gorgeous . Pretty and very colourful ... But ... People don 't take care of them as they used to do . They have tossed us away . Hey ... ? Am I still pretty ? All of these are very beautiful . That 's too bad that they are worn out , but it doesn 't matter . I 'm going to fix them good . They look pretty good now ! I 'm just a wanderer that has been travelling through this forest . I got stranded because of the storm . I entered to your shrine to seek shelter without your permission . Please forgive me . Would you let me go unharmed ? What a hideous smell . I can finally leave this place . Otherwise , I will end up just like them . Nonetheless ... I will never forget the kindness and help that they provided me tonight . I 'm grateful for every spirit that Inhabits this shrine . " For your earnest effort " 'Combustible " Japan Edo Era ( 1603-1868 ) A catastrophic incident destroyed more than half of the city . Ah , Koume , are you still busy ? I 'm sorry , little lady , I 'll play with you later . Owaka chan ! Matsuki chan ! Seiyoh , Seiyoh , Seiyoh . Chah ! Chah ! Chah ! Let 's have dinner ? Seiyoh , Seiyoh , Seiyoh . Chah ! Chah ! Chah ! Owaka chan ! Matsuki chan ! I think I lost the game . I 'll go see . Mr. Sada ! Mr. Sada Kichiro ? - Yes ! ? Where does that smell comes from ? Can you go see where does it comes from ? Alright , I 'm on my way . Just around the side of the monastery , the wind is blowing westbound , there 's nothing to worry about . Mr. Matsuki ? He 's the neighbour 's youngest son . Matsuki and his friend Kaji are so handsome . Where did Matsuki go ! ? I told you so many times that I demand strict vigilance . Look all around town ! I bet he 's hanging out with Kaji Ran again ? Kaji always knows where he goes . They found a wealthy suitor for her , did you hear ? Darling , where did you hear that ? Ms. Narita told me , she looked pretty happy . Nobody knows the name of the groom yet . Wakana , dear , why don 't you introduce yourself ? I 'm Wakana at your service . She has good intentions and works hard . But she 's still getting used to rules and customs of a proper bride . Owaka Chan ! Matsuki chan ! You stupid idiot ! You will sneak seven or eight times even if I keep catching you . You aren 't going to shame this household any longer with your behaviour . This is the last time , Matsukichi ! Nobody will show you your errors if you always keep your eyes closed . Leave and don 't return ! Owaka chan . Matsukichi . What 's wrong ? My dad has just disowned me . How come ? Matsuki chan , you 're his only heir ! It doesn 't matter . I never wanted to inherit his household anyway . So , that 's it , he 's the sole owner now . Matsukichi , you had to follow his orders to keep living with him . What am I going to do now ? How am I going to see you if you won 't live here any more ? It doesn 't matter , I will come to see you anyway . Matsukichi . Have you forgotten something ? What ? The promise we made since we were children . Our promise ? Yes , from that time . There are three days left for the wedding ! She needs to make a decision now ! She need to talk to the relatives and consider what they think of it too . They make it sound so easy . Matsukichi . A fire ! Damn it ! Move on quick ! Get out of the way , Move ! Move ! Out of the way ! Matsuki , how are things in your end ? My dad has evacuated the family already . Make sure there are no more survivors . Your house is engulfed with flames ! Understood ! Her house is gone ! I need to find Owaka chan . All is lost on this side . Evacuating people by the west end is just too risky . Direct the survivors to the opposite end ! The fire hasn 't reached that part yet . There are still plenty of survivors ! We will save as many as possible ! Owaka chan ? Knock down the stilts that are supporting the house ! What are you doing ! ? Owaka chan ! Owaka chan ! Matsukichi ! Matsukichi ! Damn it ! Watch out ! That 's no good ! That 's the signal ! Owaka chan ! Stop going that way ! Owaka chan ! Alright , Heave ho ! Pull with everything you got , you bastards ! Get away from there now ! Matsukichi ! Everyone in the village knows about you . A legendary fearful monster . Come on , monster , kill me ! Buddha Amitabdha ... Is this pleasant enough for you . Town Chief , does this looks alright to you ? Don 't worry about it , this is God 's will . Everything is going as it should ! You may say it , but ... Buddha will have compassion towards us in the end . Don 't worry about it . The ogre will have the young girl as offering and won 't attack us . We won 't be able to kill him with our rifles anyway . Help me please ! This village keep losing their strong men . Our time is running out fast , old soldier . That Devil , Could it be the ghost of a great white bear ? That 's not it , this is a fire red Ogre that 's about 13 ft. tall . Another monster ... I 'm not asking you to chase him away , I 'm asking you to kill it . Every night , a first born daughter is kidnapped and taken away for his pleasure . He has the town engulfed in total chaos . Just by now , we have only the daughter of the emperor here . The last one to offer to him in sacrifice . There 's no helping it . All the human warriors tried to fight him and lost . Kao ! Please Mr. Samurai , hear us . We trust that you would be able to help us out and slay the monster . A bear ! Please don 't eat me ! A devil arrived . Please help me , he 's after me . Gambo ? You understand my words . Don 't go alone , it 's too dangerous ! He 's more like a guardian God . Kill me , I beg you . And kill them . These are the spawns of that demon . Before I give birth to these horrendous monsters . Please kill me and don 't let them live ! Don 't hurt him ! Don 't hurt him ! Somebody stop it , please ! You are pretty naive , young girl . If you are looking to save yourself . You 'll have to trust in our power till the end . But still ! If you put faith in us , we 'll be able to slay the demon ! Demon begone ! Shoot ! Gambo ! Thank you ! What was that ! ? Answer at once , How did you do control the creature to help you ? That 's because I never lost hope in him . This is the best team that they can deploy ! Jin was the MVP at the time , almost like a superstar . Yeah , we did a damn good job at the time . Nobody sustained a single injury . That was almost 30 years ago if I recall correctly . Was it you the one that did it ? Yeah , that mission was a damn good success . I had a lot of fun with these guys . I hope we get out alive of this one . Yes , it 's gonna be a long day of work . Afterwards , let go for a sandwich and play some basketball . Yeah , eating so close to the reactor is not pleasant at all . Buki yo Saraba ( Farewell to Arms ) Nice catch ! The king of skies is back home ! The camera ! The camera ! Next time you deploy it , let me take a look at it . Sure ! Sure ! Yankee , Good job ! No problem . How long until we 're there ? In about five minutes more . We 'll be launching the first UFV soon enough . I got it . I got it right ! You guys are going to fry yourselves inside those suits . They include air conditioning inside . You idiot . You gotta have a positive attitude . We 're ready ! Why aren 't you more careful , you idiot ! I didn 't think you were going to stop so fast ! That 's not important now . Are you alright ? Come on , dude . I 'm sorry , bro . You gotta watch out next time ! Alright , it 's time to go . Avoid going through the tunnel , it 's collapsing . Search for objectives in less than a 1650 ft. radius . Rum , don 't be afraid . Male , watch where you step and be careful . Yes . Lieutenant , are you okay ? Calm down , Male just stepped over an old mine . Come on , don 't waste time . Hey ! Don 't be so loud and bossy . Agh ! I can 't breath ! Lieutenant , be careful , please . The radar is detecting some movement . Alright , it 's loud and clear . Everyone listen ! There 's an underground weapon facility west of here . We will take on the weapons of the hangar . We 'll prepare a ground assault . Be ready , no matter what we have to confront . While the UFV was informing us of the situation ... The enemy already started to move . Move out ! Hey Male ! Aim for that white building on your right . Gimlet , understood . Come on , go ! The trace is aligned ! Perfect , alright ! Jin here . I still can 't find a decent spot for a sniping point . Here Rum - in my sniping point , the coast is clear ! I 'm good ! Rum , what are you doing ? Fix the settings after you settle it down . Yankee , what are the data regarding this zone ? The enemy is advancing east . You will be able to see it through the UAV . Did they deploy the Hellfire ? " It 's on " Good , wait for more instructions . Male , how are things going on around there ? Male here - I 'm climbing the stairs to reach the 3rd floor . Copy that . Jin , inform me from your position . " Last street point " I 'm in position to open fire at any time . Continue the operation . Yankee , answer me . Yankee , here . Let Hellfire drop its load . Understood , Hellfire is going directly to the objective . Hey , Yankee ... Just now ... I saw it . That one was a GUNK , wasn 't it ? Everyone , Gimlet here ... The explosion didn 't affect it . Approach the enemy with extreme caution . I have it locked right in front of me . I can see it too . I have changed positions too . Male , don 't get cocky over there . Male here - understood . I see it already . It 's coming ! Marking the point with the laser marker . What are you doing ! ? Male , are you alright ? I marked it with the laser . I wonder how the hell he always completes the task . Male " life check , all green " he 's good . Male do a " system check " I already did it . It 's " all green " too . The battle has finally started . Alright , I 'll be the first attacker . That 's Good . Impact will happen in four seconds . Rum here - taking enemy fire . I 'm going down and change my position . Alright . Bastard ! Male Here - launching the second missile . Now , I 'll get you . Impact will happen in ... Four ... three ... two ... one ... Rum , are you okay ? Moving to the next position . RUM ! FORCED DISCHARGE ! Don 't move ! Rum ! Rum ! Calm down , I 'm still alive . Glad to hear that . Jin , when I open fire , I need you to cover me , understood ? Gimlet ! Jin , I 'm counting on you . Understood . Very good ! Come on , Jin , hurry up a little more ! Jin , how are the preparations for the extraction going ? It 's not ready yet . Damn it ! Yankee !

Everyone , it was a job well done . What did I told you , huh ! ? That sucks , it went underground . Yeah , we are all very glad for that . Now it comes the critical point of the operation . Good night , you are in the Tokyo road now . Tell me something I don 't know already . Keep us informed , Yankee . We will split here to start the search . Rum and Male , search by the east wing . No problem . we will go by the west wing . Understood . Male , don 't you have that remote controlled car to search for it ? Use it to let us know about your findings . Yes , sure . Will it be better if we split too ? Yeah , Jin is new and I 'm not sure if he 'll feel comfortable searching underground . Yeah , good luck with that , Mr. Big Boss . Hey brother , when I was shooting , I figured I could have destroyed it even if you hadn 't helped me . But of course I wasn 't going to leave a comrade behind . You idiot , only a civilian would think like that . The mission is always priority . Male here - We have pinpointed its position . It left a strong trail down here , I wonder if it 's still moving . Male here - I 'm entering the TL as we speak . Well done , start the access , we 'll start the operation soon . Yankee can you give me an update of the situation ? Yankee ? Can you listen to me , Yankee ? Answer me , Gimlet calling . Male , answer my call , this is Gimlet ! Male , can you listen to me ? There 's not enough signal coverage with Yankee . I 'll try to establish contact for a ground search party immediately . A ground search party ? Hey Male ! Your little car is out of range ? It seems today is not a lucky day . Jin . I can 't find anything here . Yankee is not answering , I have a bad feeling , let 's go back to ground level ! Rum ! It 's your fault , I can 't move ! Get down ! The Gunk is still operational ! Gimlet ! Get down and wait for my orders . Male , are you okay ? Rum is frozen , launching smoke bombs . Wait Male ! You can 't use the " discharge " here ... Rum ! Damn it ! Gimlet ! Where is Rum ! ? We may have lost him ! Gilmlet , The UFV of Yankee is showing up ! Yankee ! ? Yankee , are you still alive ! ? Here is Jin - I 'm going to flank it from behind . Use the electromagnetic grenades . Understood . Me and Male will carry the offensive move . Activate the timing at a three-count detonation . When the electric shock wave hits , attack it . Male , you 'll destroy the TL . We will use a missile , this is the only chance we will have . That 's your mission and you 're responsible for its success ! Alright let 's go , One , two , three ! Male ! What 's wrong Male ! Male , are you still around ! ? Wait , I don 't feel good ... The TL is out of service for the time being ! If it turns on when the main Cannon is blocked , it will activate and explode ! Yes . Alright Jin , this is the time to destroy it , it 's offline . But it won 't be for much longer . Male here - I finally entered inside the TL . As soon as I reach the command centre I 'll let you know . Male , hurry up ! As soon as you start it , it will explode . Gimlet , I destroyed its system and its fire weapons . I can see here that 's recovering pretty fast . I 'm sorry I can 't be of more help but I have my hands tied here ! Male here- - The fuel is pretty low but I 'll try to activate the boosters . I 'm outta here ! Be careful ! Come on , Gimlet , the Gunk is almost ready to reboot again . I 'm sorry , Gunk , but you will be buried under the rubble here ! MALE ! JIN ! Male , run away ! Jin ! Jin , run away ! Jin ! Captain Gimlet ... How about you ? can you move ? Don 't panic , activate the " escape " device . Yes , the " escape " device ! Male , Hey Male ! Are you alright ? man . Captain ! Be more careful next time . Menace to Human population neutralized .

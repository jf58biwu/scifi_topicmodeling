It 's another planet , about 800 years behind . There were a few similar planets This one was smaller and closer Besides , local grey castles were reminiscent of early Renaissance . So about 30 scientists were sent here But Renaissance didn 't happen here It was just a reaction to something , that almost didn 't happen . In the capital of Arkanar , it started with destruction of the university . As the university was a way of thinking , it was a hunt for the way of thinking . A hunt for wise guys , bookworms and talented artisans . Some fled to the neighboring Irukan . It was better there . Others , broke down or were executed . Executed by flying squads of Don Reba , the Crown Security Minister Squads were made of rioters , shopkeepers . Everyone are in grey : grey regiment , grey troops . Even minister wore grey . To match the color of local structural stone , rather worthless one . The royal guard was pushed aside . Nothing is hit , or even pinched . Screenplay by S. Karmalita , A. German Poverty , poverty . Director A. German - She rummaged ... rummaged ... - Stop , stop - She rummaged . - Bu-bu-bu The stones were white and flat . Cinematography by V.llyin , Yu . Klimenko Production design by S.

Hard to be a God He often cried while he slept . He was killing someone . In his sleep of course . He wasn 't allowed to kill . Ever . Then he heard his grandma 's voice . From his childhood on Earth . Infant is crying . She inhaled . She smoked a cigarette . " Children 's tears are water ... It 's all in your head , boy ... " The noble Don Rumata Leonid Yarmolnik She blew on his forehead , but it was a stink from a crack , that he ordered to cover with a trunk . He was trying to stick to the blanket , but woke up anyway . A chimney smoked downstairs in his huge castle . Slaves spoke loudly , though it was forbidden . And he was not on Earth , but on a different planet . Here he was a 17th generation noble don . An illegitimate son of Goran , a local pagan god . Born from the god 's own mouth . Some believed in it , some didn 't . But everyone bewared . Did you feed the turtle , idiot ? Today . Mice lick off the lard . They do . Are you wearing my boots again ? I didn 't mean to . You always " don 't mean to " . Costumes E. Shapkaitz Makeup by O. Izvekova , N.Ratkevich Boots at the table . Music by V.Febedev Sound by N.Astakhov I 'll hang myself . What ? I 'll hang myself ! - Again - What ? Why are you so loud when I 'm sleeping ? I 'd sell you all at the port . You , too . It 's a pity slaves have fallen in price . That 's how it is . Die , die you idiot ! You die ! It 's autumn , there are no mice . Special thanks to A. German-Jr . My whole life . A goose drowned here . I broke a tooth . - A picture . - Go , go , go It 's a bit shallow . Let 's do head first . He bites like a ferret . So ... so ... I found this under the pig . Letters are so smooth . So what are we ... aha - Great - Me ? Let 's go . Let 's go . Wait , wait ! What , stinker ? Do you remember , 40 years ago ... Oh , that is how You called my book the poop of the Siou bird . I don 't remember . I don 't remember ! Hey , what are you doing ? 40 years have passed . My whole life . You made it in time . In time . Didn 't you go for a walk ? Let go , asshole . This is our spyglass . Master , they drowned a wise guy in the shithouse . But this skunk ... His feet did this , then that . And then - plop ! I was nearby . Funny . A leg stuck out . Give a spyglass back to Don . You polecat . Money needs good care . You will give it back , joker . Otherwise , to the port and be sold . Don Scum . Thief . Every autumn the same thing . What can I say ? Take this . * inaudible speech - Over and over again - Noble Don , give a coin . A ring . Haha , it 's mine , it 's mine . The wind changed , now smelling of rot . The city was surrounded by fetid , bottomless swamps of Pitania . Nevertheless , at night , lit by a piece of kindling . People like that murdered bookworm , crawled to the border of nearby Irukan . Where they were met by rebelling peasants of one-eyed Arata the Hunchbacked or by fugitive slaves from tin mines , transparent like moth . Or by Colonel Kusis 's grey soldiers . You pay or you die . All because they used stone or paint to create a second nature , To decorate life of people who know nothing of beauty . For creating glass , that helped half-blinded to see and sighted to approach the sky . In such rocky hideouts , Don Rumata hid his secretly rescued wise guys . What is all this ? We are learning to fly , recently more often downward . Noble Don , take me from here . Such happiness ! And here is our angel . Dr. Budah had to be brought here from Irukan . A sober and logical mind created by this civilization . Also a good company for Don Rumata during these long Arkanar 's days . But Dr. Budah dissappeared along with the convoy . Here 's Pekh , a beast with iron tail ... You 're lying , there 's no such beast I 'm falling . Turnips , turnips Exhale ! - Ah , what ? - He is all lying You even got the birds drunk ! I will kill you Hit ! Hit it ! Destroy it ! Don 't you even dare to brew that slop again . Why is it so depressing ? Because it 's fall . Fall again ... So white . Unbearable ! Can you believe it ? That idiot synthesized alcohol . Hooray ! Hooray ! You toad ! The first on this planet ! Leonardo ! Da Vinci . Earthlings gathered here . Not so often lately . They drank more and more and got irritated at each other . I love you , but you don 't love me . Noble Dons , get the hell out of the way ! All you presidents , kings ... What a hell are you standing here ? I adopted a boy you know . He 's alone , I 'm alone ... The boy is a thief . He 's an orphan , bastard . I saw Earth again in my sleep . - Ah , dreams . - Marvellous ones ! Good to see you . Your Budah has disappeared . And the officer , too . Now they both are dead . I 'll get Budah , easily . Give me this . The boy volunteered to snitch . Tell him to bug off and to shut up . Hey you old fart ! Give me a kiss ! You 've got ants in your mouth . Here , eat that ! - I said it 's a trap . - How many times did I tell you ? Pashka got caught in a trap ! Everyone knows that ... A boar trap . Comes off together with a foot . - Give me a knife . I 'll cut it off . - It hurts you jerk ! You want some poison ? Great reviews ! Listen to me . 20 years ago ... Some fucker saw the outbreak of art here . He called it Renaissance . On this shitty planet . I laughed and you wrote that I 'm dumb . Okay , okay - maybe . But where is art ? Where is Renaissance ? Not here . The whole life , eh ? Okay , I was wrong . My bad . Forgive me . We good ? Listen everybody . I came here without guards . I was attacked by a naked runaway slave from mines . He choked me , see . That 's just a pimple . I have to go back alone . An arrow in the eye - I am dead . And you don 't want to forgive me before my death ! Come on , let 's kiss ! This scumbag has a whole crew of guards . What a liar ! I 'm not a liar . I 'm MÃ¼nchhausen . What would you do without me ? Strange fools on a strange planet ? Where is the sack ? Made of leather - That is how bird Siou screams - The one no one has seen ? Your fucking Renaissance is the most treacherous era in the Earth history ! Zurab , this one is better It 's dark and quiet . Not to me , to someone else . Well ? Not to me , to someone else . A wet umbrella rustled in . Do you want this ? How is that ? You lost your fucking minds ? * drunken singing You are a creep . Bird of Siou , that was never seen , steal silver . - And servants get punished . Is that fair ? - That bird doesn 't exist , you fool ! Muga stood over the barrel and saw it 's shadow . Oh , really ? Nobody saw it but Muga . Wonderful , only there 's no happiness yet . Hey , slave ! Like this or like that ? The rope noise scares the birds ... and they fly to the swamp , Don . But if you cover their head with fish scale birds eat their eyes out . One tobacco merchant a very smart man , he ... Slave , like this or like that ? Rain . Master , I 'm not going any further ... it 's too hard . You 'll keep walking , or I 'll whip you . Master , you won 't do that , you 're kind because you 're a god . I sure will whip you , you never dreamed of . When I die , don 't throw me into the gulf . Burry me in the ground . At least in a barn . Marksman is drunk . Hey , wait , this Arata the Hunchback Is just a blob of swamp fog . I was always sure . At the moment they took the relics of your godlike father out ... he and all his drunk peasants dissolved in the air . - So why am I a bad poet ? - An awful one ! " Falls on my soul like an autumn leaf . " " Prince and Barbarian girl . " I have the book . I burned it . How stupid of you . Give me to smoke . Marksman is drunk , dismiss him . We 're the young aristocracy . The country 's reverse breath . It was right to drown Bota in the shithouse for such poetry . Not me ! You think his poetry is bad ? - Did the prince cry today ? No ? - Hard one Such balls ! Don Rumata cuts through double Soanian armor . This one survived ! Budah didn 't go through my chancellery . The Colonel Kusis left the army . He and Don Reba are in the Lilac chambers . Speaking that lousy language . Incredible ! Show him the relics of my godlike father . Maybe he 'll disappear . No one disappears , Arata or anyone . I thought you 're interested . - I am . - Captain of crown guard . His hands are in blood , he is in blood . So it was and so it will . That is krapul our expomple . Noble Don I have a foul smell - Will I die ? - You will , you will Charming . Fear of death is a heresy , captain . - Take this - Great Buta also had a foul smell - He drank till started shitting in his pants , and barbarian girls too . - So what ? What is this ? What kind of god you are ? ( poem by B.Pasternak ) The murmurs ebb ; onto the stage I enter I am trying , standing in the dark to discover the distant echoes ... You 're a redhead ! He 's a redhead ! The murmurs ebb ; onto the stage I enter I am trying , standing in the dark to discover the distant echoes ... The coming years may hold in store . Natural darkness with a thousand ... Who wrote that ? I did ! Nocturnal darkness is an evening . But I can teach you . For money . Crown security minister , Don Reba ! - Excuse me - Go , go Don Reba , our eagle . Crown security . He delivered ice for my Dad . Barefoot . - Wow - So , Rumata , whose son you are ? Let me have a sip . Ask your dad not to turn my wine sour . Ah , it 's you You majesty . - Did it get smaller ? - It didn 't . A nice head . Who are you ? A butcher ? I 'm a colonel , a financier . You stuffed the castle with grey thugs . Where is Arata the Hunchback ? So he is just a mirage ? So great and glorious like eternity the king whose name ... - Everyone ! Kick in the nose - Redhead - Now I 'll hang myself . - No way . Oh my , what a smell . Don Reba . You should stop by for a bath . I have these comfortable huge iron barrels . No , you come over ! I have great barrels in the Tower of Joy . - On coals , with lids . Without water . - I love them . Ah , Rumata ... You are a redhead . Reba , you 've promised to strangle him . - You 're a liar , not good at anything . - He has royal blood . That should be checked . He 's good at everything . He killed half of your subjects . I summoned this doctor , Budah . For my knee pain . What 'd he do with him ? You have knee pain , too ? - Take a look - Marshal Tots ! No . It says here : " Eagle , our Knight Don Reba . " They sell it all over Arkanar . Wow ! Knight ! So you are a knight ? - Whatever they say . I don 't know . - Show me your boot . The spur . Take it off . - So where 's your doctor ? - The knight has him . I hope not in a barrel . - Bring him here ! - No inquest ? ok . He 'll answer for " no inquest " . You 'll have a laugh ! It 's night . Bloodsuckers fall from the ceiling . And she 's slippery . Keeps slipping off . No good . Try a barbarian girl . No way ! She 'll bite it off . Like someone told me . Here 's Budah . You always find something wrong . And he won 't be Budah . I 'm not good at anything ! He wasn 't Budah . He was a horse keeper . You 're not Budah . And not a doctor ! He has your letter , too . Don Rumata . Why should I drink ? It 's usually rubbed in . Why should I drink ? Rumata , you drink . Go away . He must be strangled . Marksman is drunk . Redhead , you said . The King got sick last night . Remember , tonight you 're on watch by the Prince 's chambers . The crossbow 's broken . How do I go on now ? Play what I taught you . Donkeys lift up their tales .

Humble children of the order landed last night at the Arkanar port . 30 000 of them ! Greys , that thought so much of themselves , are all dead . Arata the Hunchback 's men are hung by the roads . Let me introduce myself . I 'm the alderman of the Order . Grandmaster of the Lands , of the islands , etc . How 's that ? Great . The master 's boot . You can 't even imagine ... That you are on the edge of such a fiery abyss . See . Come on , that 's a boot . Does it stink ? That you should understand . It 's such a common thought . - A man comes to you every night . For 7 years now ! - It 's a lie ! You even called for a witch doctor . But you can 't get rid of him ! You even wrapped your head in animal skin . But that 's heresy ! That man opens his eyes ... And looks at you . Right ? Bullshit So When that man opens his eyes , he says ... Raise my eyelids . And you scream so loud your old lady pees her pants . Is that right ? Come here . That man with the eyes ... That 's me ! Me ! Go away from here Boots . A spur is bent . Maybe the abyss belched you out . Maybe you 're god 's son . I 'm having trouble myself . There 's a mouse .

They are useless and bad for anyone . The bookworms ? See , I 'm speaking to you ... but that doesn 't mean we 're having a conversation . Why did you serve such rotten food ? - Go away - Your stuff is here , Don That was the Order . It 's humble children . 200 or so years ago the order owned the Lands Beyond the Strait . Luckily , a plague sucked the order dry . It was then rotting away in the south . Over the mountains . But then it got better . It was here now . Ruthless like Brazilian ants . Rumata thought about sending at least Muga there . But didn 't get around to it ! You have so much stuff . Hey , take this , and wash your hands . Naughty you . Have some milk , Don . Gur . Weren 't you the smartest ? Get away Vaga Not Vaga the Wheel anymore What are you saying ? Fuck you What a hell ? Great . Like autumn leaves . Your autumn leaves clutter the scaffold .

We will let Don in as a guest . We 're killing whores . She 'll spread her legs , and this thing is on a spring . Rips them to pieces ! The Order ! With spurs . Noble Don ! Where did you put your hands ? What a joy ! What a pleasure for everyone ! Wipe off my temple . - What ? - What ? - What ? - Get lost A thought entered his head and settled there for good . Don Reba must be killed ! Just kill him and not think about consequences . What 's going on here ? We 're been tortured here , Rumata ! Where 's your sword ? Did you hand it in , noble Don ? I see . I had such shrub blossom today ! So beautiful ! It 's a sign ! When I was little , Don Reba was riding on a shovel , in the winter . Do you see how easy it is to breath in a new freed Arkanar ? And wine got cheaper Rumata , they put salt on birch-rods . Why ? What 's the salt for ? So is it easy for you to breath in the new , freed Arkanar ? I lost my tag , if only I didn 't Stick it up your ass . Your ass , not this one ! Try to make sure the hangman sees it . Until the day I die , Rumata . Take off your hat . The Keu barons always had privileges ! There are no privileges for the Order . 7 heavy rod whips ! Why heavy ones ? For thoughts without enthusiasm . Give me Budah . I 'll do it . Here 's your doctor . Good . You remember about the ears , right ? Of course I do Leave me something ! They are stealing everything there . - Not this - The Dons have amusing asses . Like toads ! Like your face ! Go to hell - Baron ! - So good that I found you ... Baron , I found you ! Why are you so ... Doubled up . A nobleman should be clean and smell good . Right ? What 's wrong , Baron ? My nose burst . I 'm so glad I found you . When you were arrested , I ran here . There were 1000 blacks here . I beat them until ... Then they threw a cow from a bridge on me . How their crummy skulls will crack under our baronial swords ! Here is Budah , not some Rudah . Good and alive . Eating for the road . Looks okay and the teeth are intact . Are you Budah from Irukan ? Baron , this is Budah . - I put him in jail . - What for ? Baron ! First , because he has a dog 's name . - Second ... wait - What 's second , Baron ? I did something wrong ? All this , every little piece , with my own two hands . 20 years . My whole life . Now I come to eat here . Fuck you , all ! Baron , do you have a lockpick ? You will smash me . Baron , your stuff is right there , on the left . Enlist as a soldier , son . Baron or noble Don who let them flog him ... Baron , get your the stuff . Don 't fart , Don ! Let me My noble friend , are my legs really skinny and white now ? Nice , nice legs . Why are you sniffing me ? Got lost in thought . I 'm such a Baron , you know . And you 're a wise guy . He 'll teach me to read . Then I 'll be wise , too . But you 'll never be a Baron . If you catch a cold , I got some herbs . Excuse me , woof-woof . My friend , give him money , a lot of it . My ribs haven 't healed yet . - They 'll close the gates and we 're dead . - They 'll open it right back . I beg you . Don 't do it , Baron ! Introduce me to that leutenant who cares so much about my health . Such a turkey . Don , buy an eye . It reflects light . - I got a knife as a gift - A knife was a gift ? By the way , I saw that Vaga of yours . Where are these archers , assholes ? Eating turnip ? They 'll all be whipped . Hahaha ! It 's fun again ! The sword - my friend . Where are the archers ? Hey , baron ... Who is " woof-woof " now ? Who is going to read now ? Woof-woof How ? Now there is no way . Baron Pampa del Bao-no of Arkanar , wasn 't trialed by the Big Royal Court . Or killed by the poison of the mountain bee . Or executed on a square . He was just pierced with a dozen of arrows and dumped . Rotten turnips and sour cinnamon was already dumped on top of him . At night , beggars will rip everything off his huge , strong white body . Let me free , it 's useless without a horse . He is pulling me on purpose . Where did we stop , Budah ? It 's impossible to talk like this . Let me go ! I ask questions , you don 't answer them . I asked you : What would you do if you were god ? - I wouldn 't have any urine problems . - What a hell ? Stop doing all this here Damn it , they won 't let us talk . Pee all you need , and then we 'll talk . I can 't . The most important is not to think about it . Relax . It 's better to hit the ass . And if you could give advice to a god ? If he asked for it ? That wouldn 't be heresy right ? I 'd say : Creator ! Why pee on my boots ? You came and we 're leaving . Someone killed two slaves over there . It wasn 't us . We 're officers of the Order . We 're off to sleep . Get it , smart-ass ? Come on . I 'd say ... Creator ! Give people everything that separates them . How much longer ? That won 't do them any good . Finally . Thank god . Because the strong will take from the weak . Give me a bottle . Why do you give an empty bottle ? I 'd say , punish the cruel so the strong will know not to be cruel . When the strong and cruel are punished . The stronger of the weak will take their place . You know that ... You 're a fool , Budah . Get out of here . I don 't need you . Why are you screaming at me ? Get out of here ... One splash and ... One splash and your face is gone . I 'd say , creator ! If you exist , blow us away like dust ! Like pus . Or leave us in our rot . Destroy us all ! Everyone . It is easy to destroy everything . The lice-ridden , the sick , and even the children . My heart is full of pity . I can 't do that . Let 's go home . Rains , rains ... There were many Greys . Very many . Uno was wearing your shirt . He was shooting from the stairs . Shirt was big for him . Greys put a noose around his neck . And strangled him . Then the Blacks came and started killing the Greys . - One Black gave me this . See , don 't touch it . - Why ? Don 't touch . They gave me this sign . Told me to come to the Tower of Joy tomorrow . Why did you take it ? They gave me this . So I 'd come tomorrow . - Give it to me . - Don 't touch it , give it back ! He was sitting there ! He shitted all over the cucumbers . He was in the barrel of pickles ! Shit all over the place ! - Master , I had a horse . - And now it 's dead . - Throw it out . Everyone , get out . I 'll wash my ass . Let it lie there for a while . Anguish ! Weren 't you hanged ? How could I come if I were ? Really . How did you come , Arata , if you were hanged ? Arata The Hunchback ! - Goran likes crippled . - You 're a crippled ? First my guys trusted one virgin . Old bitch - Don . The Don of peasants ! - Aim higher - You can 't make sausages . - I thought he was higher . Then we believed in monks . They are now hanged by the balls on the same trees . I almost forgot you 're a god ! That 's too bad . Your water is cold ... Make some hotter water ! Once I was being hanged on an old galley . But I managed to make ... and jumped off - They had one captain ... - Really ? Bootlicker - Angel ! Come here ! - Ah ? Don 't stare at her Come on One is already too much for you . - I knew for quiet a while that god died ! - Come on , really ? ! He pulled this cargo , like a horse . Then he got snotty ... and died ! There 's no other way ! It 's hard for a god . I saw you getting snotty today . - It 's bees - Bees It 's just a joke I have bad news for you . Today you 'll give us the fiery chariot and these shirts . And in the morning you 'll lead us ! Or else ? - Or else what ? ... - What ? You have a soft white belly ... and a bellybutton that when you poke , will go " pssshhh " My belly button . Come on . - I 'm afraid it won 't be so easy - It 's very easy That was a bird . That 's an omen . For money . You 'll fly to your Daddy . Everyone will fly one day . Like birds . Go away from here , go ! Will we have enough water ? Somebody , hold my wallet . Arata ! That 's it , bro ! Cow Leave the ring . Give it here . Not this . I wouldn 't kill you . Really ? You don 't know that ! You 're so dressed up . How was the trip here ? I won 't get you the throne . That 's the truth . You are right ! You are right this time ! I 'd burn the gold and black vermin . As far as 12 generations back . That you 're good at ! You are good at it ... You are good at it ... And you 'd give land out to your people . Right ? Yeah . Who came there ? Wise-guy . I know him , he is a fool . Throw some more water A man 's skin is made up of tiny holes . They all breath . If you cover a man with tar ... That 's it for him ! - That 's for you . - That 's it ? Good boy Arata . Without it , they won 't let you out of the city . Tell me , Arata . So you give the land to your men . Who needs land without slaves ? Who needs it without slaves ? There 'll be new slaves . New scaffolds . New golds . New Blacks . Everything will appear again . Even a new Arata . And god can 't do anything . That 's depressing . I 'd never allow that , you louse . Quiet now . Quiet , quiet , quiet ... You won 't be able to do anything . You 'd allow it ... Everyone did and always will . For thousands years . What do we do ? The same as always . The same as always . 1 ... 2 ... bzzzdin You 're a redheaded bastard . Muga , introduce him to your tobacconist ! They 'll make good friends ! Chase him with sticks through the barnyard . Okay . So what 'll happen to me ? You 'll remain in songs . That 's it ? That 's not really that little , believe me . Master , the blacks are asking for the girl with the sign . I knew it . That 's it ! Let 's cut some ears ! Stop shaking . Let me eat in peace . Shaking and shaking . Hand hurts . You 'll go with me . You 'll confirm there 's a boy in my belly . Goran 's grandson . Already ? A grandson ? - I won 't go without pants . My pants are wet now . - You 'll go . 18 generations of noble ancestors . Royal blood and no pants ! I won 't go without . Give me dry pants and I 'll go to war . I want silver pants . I don 't want to be covered with lard like chicken and burned . Ok , don 't go ! Polecat ! - Okay I 'll chase them into the gulf . Right in the ass . I promise . It 's a pity you didn 't know Baron Pampa . Could you at least clean the house ! - Did you find it ? - No . Oh , these ones The turtle was eating mice in the pants . I found them . And the turtle , too . - Laces , laces - What ? Laces ? What 's up with it ? So , silly girl , did you find my swords ? Blood is sticky . Okay . Okay . God , if you exist , stop me . Run ... God decided to kill . Stop ! You can 't , not Arima ! There he is . Arima . My name is Arima . That 's no problem . - I didn 't bring everyone . Some strange monk did . - They 'll all be punished . These people are like kids . He was standing there , calling . I saw him . With a wall-eye . A crippled hunchback monk . He brought all those fools ! Look , or I 'll flog you to death ! - I 'm the eye of the Order . That 's my job ! - It 's a mistake . It was some strange , monk . - Is it blood ? - Ah , it stinks . What ? The Creator gave us pain . I went to university too . - From university ? - I 'm the eye of the Order . My hands are slippery . I will kill everyone here . And you too , student ! Heresy . Heresy ! I didn 't take anything ! The hat of sorrow ! Nobody steals under the Order . Everyone . God , stop me . It 's like not me . Not everyone 's destined . I can 't either . It 's just ... why .

And that 's life . Life . And life again . I never left the house . Here is your destiny . Kiun from Tin Street . Slander of the Order . That 's serious . Not so good about you , too . But we will ... You can pardon all these ones , Don . Why don 't you give me , the foolish Don , 200 more street folks ? You 'll find someone else . You don 't care who to burn . Isn 't that right , student ? You can 't ! Stop . Put the boards down . - Who wants water ? - Pull it up ! - Ribs - We need one more chain Rock him so the shit drips off . A student . An impotent and inept one will give up without knowing Where the monster 's heart is , if the monster even has one . Don , I think I 've gone blind ! An officer . It squelches here . It always squelched here . Foo . You are such a person though ... - Let me go or I will stab you - Yeah , yeah . It 's slippery Hello there What might be ... nothing might be .

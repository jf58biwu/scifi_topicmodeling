 You okay ? That was a close one . Yeah , but it worked . Good news is , we only needed one of them . Get him to the cryo-lab for testing . Next time , you can be the bait . One vector . One vector . We 've hardly seen any since Peter was taken . Where 'd they all go ? I must insist you return upstairs . This exercise is too dangerous . On the contrary , Level R seems ... almost abandoned . Any idea how 50 vectors just ... disappear ? He came from in here , right ? Yeah . We 're on the bottom level of the base ? Yes . Then why is there air coming up from below ? This isn 't the bottom level , is it ? What 's down there ? Tell them everything , or I will . Tell me what ? Level X. Level X. There 's a ... ? What is on Level X ? The virus vault . It 's where we keep all our original core samples . You have original samples of Narvik ? A and B strains ? Of course he does . He created them . Come with me . You engineered an apocalypse virus ? I was never going to deliver it . That doesn 't matter . Ilaria wanted a virus and a cure . I used them to create something more beneficial . Like creating smallpox to cure cancer ? If I didn 't , they would have hired another lab , one that might have given them the virus . Without me , you 'd be dealing with a billion bodies by now . No , you don 't get to play the hero . What you 've done is unconscionable . - Sutton was a much greater evil . - Was ? What happened to her exactly ? She is no longer a problem . What 's coming next is far worse than Sutton . What do you mean ? Sutton was just a messenger . Next , they will send an army . They will not stop until they have the virus . Then we need to get down there and destroy the virus before ilaria get their hands on it . Show them . Just give me a second to pull up the image . Sure , where is it ? You have a lot of explaining to do . I 'm sorry . I was trying to protect you . - You goddamn drugged me . - Go right ahead . Yeah , here we go . Tell me about the picture . The one of us . I couldn 't have been more than 6 years old . This place is massive . This is the main problem . We have met before , when you were a child . Then you knew my mother ? Of course . She was extremely talented . A top-notch cellular biologist . And yet you asked me about her , pretending you 'd never heard of her . Your mother was one of the finest scientists I ever met . A great mentor . She was also a dear friend . I visited her several times in Montana . That 's when that photo was taken . How is that photo even possible ? It was 30 years ago . You look exa ... I was a very young man . So it 's just a coincidence that I 'm here , at your base , all these years later ? Coincidence , karma , fate . Call it what you wish . You still here ? Why didn 't the old lady let you go ? Seems she had different plans . Too bad she won 't be here to see the shitstorm crash down on this place . In two days , ilaria 's gonna drop in , full force . Yeah ? Hope we 're here to see it . Shouldn 't be a problem . Aren 't you supposed to be a Houdini with locks ? Most locks . They added an electromagnetic seal after I got out last time . Meaning what ? I can get the door unlocked , but I can 't get it to move , genius . Level X was here long before we were . - It 'll be here long after we 're gone . - What was it ? Remains of an abandoned Russian trading post from the 1850s . - I 'll pull up the security cameras . - Oh , my God . At least now we know where all the vectors went . They are attracted to heat . The vault has its own power supply . Is the vault secure ? Solid as a rock . So how do we get down there to destroy what 's left of the Narvik samples ? There is a secure staircase . I will go down . Like hell you will . I don 't trust you anywhere near that virus . And how do you plan to get past the vectors ? We already know the halothane gas doesn 't work on them . I don 't know yet . Guys , take a look at this . - What are they doing ? - It 's swarm behavior . Like bees in a hive , they 're all drawn to something . Or someone . Don 't know what you 're trying to accomplish . We got better results with the Racal suits . You have Racal suits for every vector on this base ? Yeah , good point . Ready for the cold stuff ? Yeah . Look at that . CFC gas . Puts them in a state of paralysis . That ought to do the trick for the vectors downstairs . Yeah , there 's just one problem . I don 't have enough gas to hit the whole floor . I won 't be needing the gas . How are you gonna get the temperature down ? You gotta hit minus 40 to see any results . It 's minus 50 outside . Sure . So , what , they 're gonna follow you right out ? Hey , that 'd be a hell of a snowball fight . I 'm bringing the outside to them . Why don 't you just bang your head against it ? Probably just as effective . Better that than getting murdered . I don 't think Hatake works that way . Huh ? He 's hyper efficient . Killing us causes more problems than it solves . At least for now . Then we have a chance . If we can hold out until ilaria blows this place . They don 't know we 're down here . If they blow up the base , we 're locked inside . We gotta let them know , man . Maybe we can light a signal fire or something . Keep thinking , Klein , because that 's what you 're good at . Hey , I just wanna be standing at the end of this . Not like Sutton or that Inuit bitch . What about the Inuit girl ? Sutton sent a squad down to kill her and burn her whole village to the ground . No loose ends . We 'll have no way of communicating between the mechanical room and Level X. The walls are too thick , so everything will have to be perfectly timed . Daniel will prep the base while Hatake and Jordan take the power grid offline . Julia and I will make the descent to Level X to destroy the core virus . I should go with you . You can 't . I need you to keep an eye on Hatake . It 's just flipping switches . I don 't trust him with Julia . Alan , let me go down there alone . Are you crazy ? Vectors in the ducts didn 't attack me . Peter didn 't attack me either . We still don 't know why they do or don 't do anything . Shit . You all right over there ? Uh , yeah . My zipper 's just caught . Take this . Just in case . She won 't need it , you will . Step one , Hatake and Jordan familiarize themselves with the power grid . Make sure the boilers and the forced air system are turned off in sequence . One . Two . Three . This is three . That 's four . Sorry . Three , four . Then ... It has to be perfectly timed . If the power 's still on when Julia and I get to Level X , the vectors will still be active , and we don 't want that . Step two , Daniel and his security team will distribute thermal blankets to as many uninfected as possible . Now , it 's 28 minutes maximum . Should be survivable , but after that , hypothermia will start to set in , and we 'll start losing people . Survival blanket . Ha , ha . You wanna feel real cold ? You should try working here for a while . Oh , what , no takers ? How about a pay check ? Haven 't had one of those in a while . Step three , Julia and I will descend Hatake 's private staircase at exactly 0200 . Mark . - Access granted . - At the same time , you and Sarah tum off the power grid . We flood the base with all that outside air , and freeze the vectors in place . Now . Now . Go ahead . One . Two . Three , four . The blowers stop , the pressure will change , then the hot air will rise up and out as the cold air sinks down to the bottom of the base . Hiroshi , I 'm gonna die soon , and nothing I did will ever matter . L ... I accomplished nothing . I left nothing behind . It will be like I never even existed . Dr. Jordan ? Can you hear me ? And I worked so hard but it doesn 't matter . Can you hear me ? How do you think we 'll know if your plan worked ? If we 're not attacked and infected when we get to this Level X , then it worked . Emergency power active . Emergency power active . What the hell , man ? Are they here already ? No , it 's too soon . What do you think it is ? Opportunity . Thought you couldn 't break the electromagnetic thingy . Not with the power on , Einstein . We 'll have 28 minutes tops to destroy the core virus and get back upstairs before the heat comes on . Cold . It 'll get worse . Keep moving . Alan , if this doesn 't work ... If this doesn 't work , we burn the base to the ground with everyone in it . Everyone ? Even Peter ? Even Peter . But if we destroy the base , how do we get home ? We don 't . Jesus . Eighteen minutes . Keep moving . Access granted . Oh , my God . There are too many . " Ebola-Zaire , Ebola-Reston . Rift Valley fever . " What the ... ? " Marburg , Lassa , Spanish flu . " They 've got more strains here than we do at the CDC . Wait , don 't put them back . We don 't have time . We have to find the Narvik . We have 11 minutes , all right ? That 's less time than we need . You wanna leave all these for ilaria ? We should go upstairs , hunker down and wait for reinforcements . I 'll take my chances outside . It 's suicide out there . I have to . I 'm not leaving the base . No , you 're not . Have you ever seen death ? Ever stared it right in the face ? Do you know what that 's like ? No . I thought it would be a dark and empty hole . But it 's not . It 's as bright as day and it 's filled with all the things you never did in your life . Dr. Jordan , we are almost at hypothermia limit . Please , it 's almost time . I 'll never cure the incurable . I 'll never crack an RNA code , I 'll never win the Seaborg . And I 'll never have children . Doctor ? Dr. Jordan ? Son of a bitch . " Yersinia pestis . " This is the Black Death . " Plague of Justinian . " " Cocoliztli . " " Sweating sickness . " It 's like a who 's who of mass epidemics in here . Narvik . It 's gone . Someone got here before us . Maybe it was misplaced . We 're out of time . Not yet . Jules , we don 't have time . - Wait , wait . - Jules . Okay . No , no . We don 't have time . Wait , please . They 're waking up ! Aw , shit ! If you shoot me , you kill your sister and your brother . Tell me . Sutton sent a squad to track down Anana and burn the village . Bullshit . We rounded up all her men . Apparently not . It 's the truth . Believe me . Why do you care ? Because at some point , it just has to stop . Now , you can shoot me , but I 'm still going . No , you 're not . We 're going . Keep going , don 't stop . Don 't worry about me . Wait . Come on ! Alan , those are my initials . We don 't have time ! Alan , those are my initials . I did that . How ? I don 't know , but I 'm here for a reason , and I have to go down there . Are you sure about this ? I was a little girl , 6 or 7 , but my mother brought me to this place . She knew Hatake . Why didn 't you tell me ? I thought I was hallucinating from the virus , but it was a repressed memory . Something I didn 't wanna know , until now . Jules , that door will not hold forever . If we go down there , we may not come back up . I 'm not asking you to come with me . I 'm not asking your permission . This is it . This is why I 'm here . You 're sure ? Oh , my God . Jules , what is this place ? Where are we ? Home . What 's wrong ? The trail 's gone . I thought you were supposed to be good at tracking . Our people can 't track anything through the blowing snow in the night . Our people are also really good at not being followed . Anana . You two make more noise than a rutting caribou . My snowmobile threw a track . I saw your lights about 2 miles back . Thought you were part of ilaria . That 's why we 're here . Sutton sent a death squad after you . A group came by about three hours ago . How many ? Three snowmobiles , five riders . They on their way to the village ? As far as we know , with orders to terminate . We need to go , now . You told me you spent summers in Montana . I did . Apparently also here . But why would Hatake build an exact replica of my mother 's cabin ? Seems like something you 'd have told me by the third date . It looks exactly the same . How ? The question is , why ? Why bring a 6-year-old girl here ? Why build a fake cabin to make her think it was home ? I don 't know . What do you remember about your mother ? Hardly anything . She died when I was young . Well , think , Jules . There must be something . Peter said something to me . Peter spoke to you ? When I was hallucinating , he said : " It 's about you , Julia . It 's always been about you . " Might have been your subconscious talking . Or it might be the reason we 're all here . We have to go . About 15 civilians being loaded into a trailer . Why would they do that ? My guess is they 're gonna set it on fire . Less to clean up that way . Easy . I 'm not gonna let them burn to death . Neither am I. We just can 't go strolling in there . You gotta think like a soldier . He 's right . We 're outnumbered and outgunned . Can you get us close ? Oh , yeah . - Come on , keep moving . - Keep going ! Go on ! Go on ! Let 's go ! Get in ! Hey , you missed one ! Caught her around the perimeter about to snipe your ass . We checked . We didn 't see anyone . - Sir . - We didn 't see anyone , sir . Miksa ? Hey , that 's one of them . He works for me . Stay down ! Please , Tulok . Stay down ! I 'm with him . I don 't know any stupid Eskimos . Alan , I 'm sorry I never told you . Alan 's not here , but you 're going to be okay . The surgery didn 't work . It was too close to the spinal cord . Grade 4 metastatic . As soon as we get back to Hatake 's office , I 'm gonna find out ... Stay back , Peter . Get right behind me . Stay close . What are you doing ? Trust me on this . Go upstairs . Go . Jules ... I 'll hold them back . Go ahead , finish him . Wait a minute . Let him do it . Sir , our orders are no headshots , in case the skulls are dug up after we burn them . Oh . You mean like this ? How did you do that ? I don 't know , I just did . But how did you know ? Ever since my recovery , I 've felt different . I mean , my eyes changed , but that 's not all . I don 't know how to explain , but the vectors seem to have lost interest in me . More like they were afraid of you . Maybe they were . I have so many questions . We both know who has the answers . Brother . Brother . Don 't ever call me Eskimo again . Level B. Sarah . What happened ? I should be asking you . How could you not know she had a grade 4 spinal tumor ? A spinal tumor ? Is she symptomatic ? She suffered a seizure about 20 minutes ago . Her pulse is weak , thready . Get her into the ICU as soon as possible . We can hook her into the life support we used on Peter . So where is the core virus ? Gone or never there . That 's impossible . Given the last nine days , you may wanna remove that word from your vocabulary . How did you not know ? You didn 't know , right ? Maybe I didn 't wanna know . I saw all the signs , the tremors , the morphine . You can 't blame yourself . Except if I had known , I would have done the same thing . I needed her on the job more than I needed her healthy . Shes really good , Alan . She has the spark . We have the spark . - Sarah ? - Alan , wait for me . Wait for me until I finish my training . Sarah , just relax . Try to sleep , all right ? Mm . Sleep with me again , Alan . Maybe you should , uh ... Maybe I 'll get her stabilized . Of course . And then , you can ... Jules . It 's fine . We 're divorced , remember ? You knew my mother . You built a replica of my childhood cabin . None of this is coincidence . Who the hell are you ? This was one of the happiest days of my life . Me , you ... and your mother . That 's Jaye . But my mother 's name was ... Jane . Or to a 4-year-old , Jaye . I 've waited for this day longer than you could possibly know . I was afraid . Of what ? Rejection . I wanted you to know me , but it was never the right time . What are you saying ? The cabin is not a replica . That 's not possible . You never lived in Montana . No , that 's not possible . Who are you ? You have ... your father 's eyes . Did we ever play with those little cars ? Hot Wheels . All the time . Was there a white one with the doors that opened-l ? Like wings ? Yeah . Up , not out . Heh . Like wings . That was my favorite . You punched me for it once . Yes , I did . Even ? We need to talk about what 's coming next. ilaria will ... You idiot . Sit . We don 't have any time . You can 't save the world if you 're bleeding to death . This is why women will always be the stronger sex .

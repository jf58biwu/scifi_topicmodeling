 Briareos . About this solo mission to infiltrate the Argonauts ... Are you still insistent ? I 'm not going to decline . I was specifically chosen for it . It 's too dangerous . All the more so if this giant Landmate is real . Lance made the decision . take it up with him . This mission is too much for you to handle . That 's why I 'm going alone ... Because I want to fix that and find paradise ! You didn 't used to be like this . You were never like this when I lived with my mom or when I was forced to learn to use knives and guns day in and day out ... like Karl did . Like my detestable old man ? ! Deunan ... Karl was ... I don 't need a partner like you . Deunan ... It 'll take two hours for it to take hold . Rest until then . These are implanted into some bioroids . This one will only last for two weeks . It 'll disintegrate on its own after that . Thanks . I guess now ES.W.A.T. can keep tabs on whether I 'm alive or not . Another dangerous job ? A compass ? On your desk there ... yes . I guess I never mentioned it . It 's a keepsake from my late husband . Huh ? I 'm sorry ... It was a long time ago . Don 't worry about it . your partner was pretty worried about you . Don 't wait until it 's too late . I speak from experience . How ... did he die ? Huh ? I 've been wondering about it for a while now . You 've always been there to lend an empathetic ear whenever I needed to vent about Briareos or my dad ... Compasses always point north . compasses always point in the same direction . What brought that on ? sorry . I 'm reminded of those words he said long ago and Briareos getting along . you really should patch things up with him . I hear the Argonauts have announced a terrorist attack . How has Poseidon responded ? and insists on its independence . I 'm told Poseidon will have to exercise the use of force if armed guerillas are confirmed to be lurking within the Argonauts . huh ... This truly is a repeat of twenty years ago . it might just take flight this time ... The mythical Landmate known as the " Bronze Bird . the exo-atmospheric Landmate ? ! founded by Alcides ! son of Alcides and inheritor of his will ! Your skills and your spirit must continue to live forever ! So this is where the Argonaut is ... let me carry some . I 'll do it . Just let me . Here . Thanks . too . Thanks ... Pollux ! You need to work out more . Briareos ! 113 . Shifting from Point C to F. 45 to 113 . Shifting from Point C to F. 113 ? You aren 't paying ' attention . sorry . still got her on the mind ? That 's why I 'm going alone ... To find paradise ! You didn 't used to be like this . American Imperial FBI ... EU intelligence agents ... And colleagues from all sorts of other nations ... It 's practically a spy trade show . Hyllus ... A cyborg ! all right . I 'm not just " some girl " ! Take a good look around you . Huh ? Isn 't that that big-shot Poseidon doctor ? huh ... - Yay ! Yay ! - Yay ! Yay ! - What 's with the luggage ? hello ! Briareos ! Perfect timing ! Huh ? Could you babysit for just a day ? Pretty please ? ! No can do . I 'm on duty . Deia 's going back to Poseidon now ! I can 't take care of a baby all by myself ! You 're returning to Poseidon ? Yes . My term is up . I enjoyed my time here . there ! now ! Don 't cry ! don 't cry ! Don 't cry ! No cwying ! Thanks ! Let 's go . What 's wrong ? Even kids like them are terrorists ? Don 't get the wrong idea . We just don 't want anyone interfering with our lives here . you sure know how to make someone feel welcome . A Colt Government ... That 's quite an old gun you have there . It 's just a good luck charm . A keepsake from my old man . A keepsake ? A guy named Karl Knute used to carry that same model everywhere he went . You know my dad ? He was your father ? were comrades . Why would my dad partner with a terrorist ? Alcides is not a terrorist . just like in Olympus . Alcides founded the Argonauts in the hopes of finding a paradise where people can live like people . Technological development made by man alone ... That was the challenge that faced us if we hoped to change our future . the Argonauts finally successfully developed their own unique technology . this technology rapidly advanced and grew grander in magnitude . a large Landmate designed for outer space deployment . that it surpassed Poseidon 's and made the Argonauts ' name known throughout the world . declared independence to safeguard that technology and the people on the Argonaut . and other sordid antagonists . Karl Knute was brought in as a self-defense instructor . Alcides . will this voyage you 're on lead to a clear future for mankind ? I don 't know . But I believe this is my destiny . as Alcides the hero . Karl . Will you join me ? I must return to my homeland . What are you going to do back home ? I hear the situation there has turned ugly ... I want to keep my family safe . Family ? I have a kid on the way . I want to teach her how to live so she can survive anywhere she goes . Karl left . So she can survive anywhere she goes ... like Karl did . Alcides had a child on the way at the same time too . And that 's Hyllus ? he 's just a bioroid created from Alcides ' genes . Huh ? Alcides died protecting the woman carrying his child . And thus ended the Argonaut 's voyage . leaving the ship to rust in a sea of salt . But Alcides ' will and technological skill still remain here . So the Landmate does still exist ? Is that what you 're after ? Then there 's no harm in showing you . Huh ? There is no paradise where people can live like people . Here it is . This is the Stymphalean ? It 's just a bunch of junk . I was completely taken in by a toy that doesn 't even work . It 's not junk . It 's hope . Alcides himself said that things aren 't important to preserve . Skills are . The technological prowess to build Stymphaleans is in our hands ! Hyllus . You will bring calamity upon the Argonauts . I 've dedicated myself to protecting this place ; I even made myself into a cyborg to live longer . son of Alcides and inheritor of his will ! I don 't know if you 're from Poseidon or Olympus . But I wouldn 't be surprised if Hyllus was created by your people . So you insist on declaring independence and forcing bombardments again ? ! if it 'll spread the Argonauts' name around the world once more . You 'll never be a hero ... you can 't protect those you love ! Vengeance belongeth unto me . Who 's there ? ! Alcides ? ! Hyll ... Elman ! You 've left yourself wide open . Vengeance belongeth unto me . I will recompense . what is it to be a god ? The bombardment Poseidon was planning has been called off . I 'm told Poseidon recon has confirmed the ringleader 's death . huh ? What about Deunan ? Lance ? we 've asked Poseidon 's recon team to search for Deunan . Her vital signals have vanished . - What 's going on ? - An accident ? Is that ? No way !

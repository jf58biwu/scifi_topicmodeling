 Can we have a manager to the front , please ? Manager to the front . [ Cellphone rings ] This is Cameron . Hello ? [ Rapid beeping ] I 'm looking for ice cream . Uh , ice cream . Um , end of the aisle . It 's time to kill . Excuse me ? Hey . You free on Saturday , Hicks ? You want to take a shift for Hector ? Yeah , sure . Time to kill , Hicks ? Pull the trigger . [ Siren walls ] Kill . [ Overlapping voices ] Pull the trigger ... - Time to ... - Kill . Hey , it 's time . [ Voices continue ] Yeah , man , a real rasta thing , you know . Pull the trigger . [ Older woman 's voice ] It 's time to kill . [ Manager 's voice ] Pull the trigger . [ Older woman 's voice ] It 's time to kill . [ Rastafarian 's voice ] Pull the trigger . [ Manager 's voice ] Time to kill , Hicks ? [ Older woman 's voice ] It 's time to kill . [ Manager 's voice echoing ] Pull the trigger . [ Older woman 's voice ] It 's time to kill . Pull the trigger . [ Car horn blares ] [ Continuous rapid beeping ] [ Ticking ] [ Manager 's voice ] Pull the trigger . [ Gunshot , shell casing clanks ] He 's inside . Hello , Don . Just come right in , please . You eating ' grass again ? Oh , that 's Asian pennywort . It increases the blood flow and oxygen to the brain . It 's a quite a eye-opener . Want a bite ? I don 't eat shrubs . For you . Well , this seems , uh , sticky . No kidding . People are asking questions to which answers are scarce . Well , I understand , - but my group- - - Has deniability , Rosen . It doesn 't technically exist . So you do this for me and don 't bust my balls . So refreshingly candid , Don . [ Blender whirring ] What the hell are you wearing ? [ Blender stops ] I try to swim two miles each day . Look , this is important . Lives are at stake . Um ... That 's not exact coffee . It 's a kind of ayurvedic roasted barley grain . You 're welcome to it , but , uh ... Right away , Lee . And get a new doorbell . [ Siren whoops ] [ Rock music ] Sign right here , ma 'am . You 're lucky I didn 't take you in for reckless driving . And I really appreciate it . Can you do me a favor and ... take your glasses off ? Take this ticket and eat it . [ Echoing ] There you go . The carbon , too . Are you single or ... Have a nice day , officer . I spoke to Donna . Have you seen my keys ? Uh , check the front cupboard . She and Jerry want us to come to the shore this weekend . Yeah , but they 're not over there . They say they 've been trying to get in touch with you . I know . Um , they 're not here . It 's just gonna be more awkward after the hearing when you 're back on the job . I know . Please , can you focus with me ? - Help me find my keys . - Phil . Phil ? Stop . Just stop . Eye contact . [ Deep breath ] Deep breath . Have you checked your other jacket ? I checked my jacket . Your other jacket . Right . What do you know ? This is why I married you . [ Laughs ] [ Groans ] You okay ? I love you . I feel sorry for you , woman . [ Laughs ] Hey , hey . Thank you . Love you . You , too . Say hi to Dr. Rosen . [ Sighs ] [ Grunts ] [ Grunting ] [ Tires squealing ] You got a problem ? [ Background chatter ] - Hey , Sam . - Rachel , where 's your mother ? She 'll be down in a second . Sam , can you hem this for me , just an inch , please ? Any shorter , it 's a miniskirt . It still covers my knees , papa . Don 't start . And don 't wait up , okay ? I gonna be working late again , okay ? - Again ? - Again . What else is new ? Don 't worry . Be careful . She 's 24 ? Breaking her mother 's heart . Where is your daughter at this point , two sons ? Three sons . [ Muffled ] Three sons . [ Metal scrapes ] [ Needle jackhammers ] [ Steam hisses ] I don 't even think she 's looking for a husband . Not that she 'd get one with her condition . [ Steam hissing ] [ Noise returns to normal level ] You almost ready , Gary ? Gary ? You want your cereal , the other one ? [ Overlapping voices , electronic static ] Here , you like this one . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Omega three . Omega . Two fluid ounces . Mmm . [ Electronic noises ] [ Overlapping voices ] Gary , stop watching the TV ... Or whatever . Ha ! Poof . It disappeared . They 're almost here . [ Car horn honks ] - Hey . - Good morning . - Hey , Gary . - Hey . Hey , cool jacket . - It 's new . - Yeah . Touch it . This is good for him , Sandra . Human interaction and normal activity . It 's all good . Now you 're just trying to make me feel better . Well , you should feel better . You deserve to . Well , at least I can get to the salon now . Really hates that place . - I can drive . - No , he can 't . He can 't drive . You know , I think your hair looks lovely just the way it is . Thank you . Have a good day . - Bye . - Bye . Bye . Thanks , Gary . You should have made this coffee stronger . Well , you could make it yourself next time . I 'm putting my lunch in the refrigerator . - Hi , Gary . - Okay . Good morning . My mother doesn 't want me to eat fast food , so I have to eat what she makes me . You got it . And that 's why my name is on it . Don 't eat what 's inside my bag . So what you 're saying is I can eat your sandwich , right ? No , don 't ! That 's why my name is on it . I changed my name to Gary , too . - Bill . - I 'm joking . It 's a joke . Conference room , two minutes , you guys . You 're not funny . You don 't get it . You don 't get it . I don 't get it ? If nobody laughs , it 's not funny . Good morning , Nina , Bill . Good morning , sir . Uh , my apologies for , uh , starting the morning so abruptly , but , uh , we have an urgent matter . Rachel , over here , please . Now , what we 're going to see is , uh , security footage from a camera in interrogation room three at police headquarters in Manhattan . You ready ? Uh , yes . This information you acquired , the encryptions were considered unbreakable . Maybe it just came to me , like the notes of a song . Now , watch this . This is where it gets interesting . That 's very funny . Uh , Mr. Keeler , tell us more ... Oh , I 'm sorry . Oh , one moment . It must be this , uh ... It 's not the laptop . If I fix it , I can get to drive the car . Uh , we 'll see . [ Overlapping comments ] You know what , Dr. Rosen , how about you just explain it to us then ? Of course . Um ... NYPD brought in , uh , a suspect involved in blackmail , extortion , certain activities that , uh , caught the attention of our generous patron , Don Wilson . It just comes to me , like the notes of a song . That 's funny . Mr. Keeler , could you , uh , tell us more about the method you describe ? I 've already told you enough . [ Thwack ] The prisoner was killed instantly . I don 't see a gun . Oh , you fixed it , wonderful . It was the VGA display port . Ah , thank you , Gary . So Wilson was in the room , right ? What 's his take ? He stumped . Uh , the room was sealed , a sing door and no windows , and no gun was found . So maybe someone manipulated the footage . No , all tampering was ruled out . No , this is a ... This is a classic locked room mystery . Hate those . So we need real eyes on the scene , right ? - So ideally a CSI unit or ... - Real eyes . A forensics team from Quantico . Well , Wilson wants it done quietly , so ... So we 're on our own again . Yeah . Uh , I appreciate your patience , Bill . I 'm on it . I fixed the TV , Dr. Rosen . I fixed the TV . I 'm the driver . Absolutely not . [ Background chatter ] Shoot . Does anybody have any change for the meter ? - Change ? - Nina ? Yeah , I don 't carry change , but any of you have a credit card ? Yeah . They take credit cards . Hey , guys , here , take some change . I 'm gonna see what 's going on . Nina , can you get inside the room ? Stupid question . I don 't even think I 'd know how to walk in those . I got a closet full of these . - I 'll hook you up . - Hook me up . You want some , uh , stilettos , Gary ? Yeah , hook me up . Do you mind if we take a quick peek ? Who are you with exactly ? We can 't- - we can 't tell you , but we can do things that we 're not supposed to talk about ... - Gary . - That 's why we can solve this . It 's also why you need to stop bugging us- - Gary , that 's enough . Have to let us do what we need to do . - That 's enough . - Shh ! Shouldn 't be a problem . Excuse me ? The problem is all the water you drank . You have to go so badly , it must be hard for you to stand there . [ Echoing ] You really have to go . I really gotta go . Take your time . You did it to her , didn 't you ? Dr. Rosen says that we 're not supposed to use our skills ... - Hey , Gary , chill . - Unless it 's an emergency . Chill . We got five minutes , tops . I 'm just telling you what Dr. Rosen said . Gary , please ... Just look for clues . [ Gary speaking , muffled ] Hey , what do ya got ? She can 't hear you . She 's doing a visual . [ Quietly ] All right , so I got details on the slug . She can 't hear you . You don 't need to whisper . Right . It 's a .30 caliber . That 's from a rifle . How does someone sneak a rifle in a room like this ? That 's a good question . Does anybody know where this vent goes ? Well , this is very dramatic . Can 't wait to hear what you 've got to tell me , hmm ? Um , the shooter was here , Dr. Rosen , facing east towards police headquarters . Come here , I 'll show you , here . Gary , over here . The shooter , he lined up his shot , aiming at a vent on the western face of the building . That 's exactly what I said . She can read The New York Times from ten blocks away . Let her roll . He fired a single bullet . [ Gunshot ] The bullet entered the building at a 30-degree angle . It traveled through an air shaft and then collided with an interior vent at the interrogation room and ricocheted right into the victim . Oh , I 'm sorry , you forgot the part about the bird that farted in New Jersey . I thought that that was funny . - That 's funny , a bird fart . - Someone has a sense of humor . Well , I like it . But is there any evidence to corroborate this elegant hypothesis ? Uh , what about this for evidence ? Hey , whatever that is , leave it alone . I 'll be damned . It 's a .30 caliber . Good work . [ Camera lens clicking ] The clinical term for it is hyperkinesis . It 's a rare condition , like someone who has perfect pitch . Extraordinary balance , perfect aim , and perfect synchrony between thought and action . Like a Peyton Manning with a gun ? Yes . Hyperkinetics often show an impressive but sporadic aptitude for sports . And not just riflery , or hunting ... Table tennis , figure skating ? Bowling , archery , ping-pong . Oh ! Ping-pong is table tennis . Rachel , um , did you get a peek at that bullet casing ? Softball , volleyball , - football . - Uh ... There wasn 't a print , but I 'm gonna take a closer look . Football , British golf , miniature golf . - Does he ever stop ? - Hey , you shut up . Gary , what did we talk about ? He started it . And how do we end it ? I stop . So , um , basically , we 're looking for an athlete ? Yes . And , relatedly , someone who might have a predilection to over-stimulus , uh , self-medication . Join the club . Possible addiction , even a criminal record . So we got a athlete , drug addict , sniper , which means some sort of military training . Starting to look like real a criminal profile , which would mean this is almost like a professional investigation . Whatever , Bill . [ Laughs ] - I 'm gonna go- - - Whatever , Bill . Whatever , Bill . Okay . - Thank you . - Okay . Gary ? I have a bad attitude . [ David Bowie 's The Jean Genie playing ] ? ? ? Small jean genie snuck off to the city ? ? strung out on lasers ? ? and slash-back blazers ? ? and ate all your razors ? ? while pulling the waiters ? ? talking ' bout Monroe ? ? and walking on snow white ? ? New York 's a-go-go ? ? and everything tastes nice ? ? poor little greenie ? ? whoo-hoo ? ? get back home ? Hey , how you doing ? I haven 't talked to you in a long time . [ Channel-changing static , overlapping voices ] ? He screams and he bawls ? ? yeah , jean genie ? ? let yourself go ? ? ? [ Background chatter ] ? Sits like a man ? ? but he smiles like a reptile ? ? says he 's beautician ? ? and sells you nutrition ? Make this quick . Oh , look at this . Japanese import , Children of the Revolution . Hard to believe Marc Bolan started his career in a skiffle band . What do you want ? I want to know what you 've gotten us into . You know what you need to know . No , I 'm afraid I don 't , and I 'm not gonna move forward until I do . You jump when- - [ Cell phone rings ] So hostile . You weren 't breast fed , we 're you ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . Whatever you say . You think I 'd put these people in danger on your word alone , don ? Think again . So some answers , please . Okay . Red Flag . The Alpha group ? The extremists ? You call them extremists . I call them criminals , terrorists . But I thought we shut them down . Yeah , we did , but they 're back , and now they 're expanding from networking Alphas into human trafficking , drugs ... And murder . You saw the tape . Red Flag put a bullet in our only witness . Now you know what I know . Can I , uh ... Uh , scout 's honor ? On my mother 's grave . How long has he been back on active ? Persky ? Couple a weeks , I think . Well , he looks fine to me . Two surgeries I heard . Do you mind ? Do I mind what ? Well , technically , I 'm not supposed to share it out of department . This is a joint op . I still do have my badge , right ? Not if it was up to Persky . Yeah , well , forget him . How many of these damn things did you pull ? You wanted vets with PTSD and a list of priors . It 's not a short list . What do you do , Bill ? One week you come in , you ask for a file on a hundred - year-old Russian chess master . Now it 's military snipers with a history of going nuts . What is it ? I 'm rehearsing for Jeopardy ! [ Camera lens clicking ] Any luck with those files ? Oh , yeah . Thank you . Don 't forget who hooked you up . Mmm . This looks delicious . Mmm ! This is really good . Thank you . Well ... Rachel , where are we ? Anything yet ? Um , well , we didn 't actually get a fingerprint off the bullet casing , but I did manage to pull some biological residue . Um , traces of , uh , citrus rind , nicotine , pharmaceuticals , and ... Um ... Is there something bothering you , Rachel ? It 's nothing . It 's nothing really . No ? Oh . Well , indulge me , hmm ? Please . It 's Bill . He 's--he 's messy , and he 's rude , and he just- - He takes things without asking and- - Yes , I- - No , I understand . Bill has some boundary issues . - Some ? - Well , we 're working on them . You know , the best thing for him is , uh ... And for you , is to confront him and tell him how you feel , what you need , and ... No . I 'm--just I--I 'm ... I can 't . I 'm sorry . - Yes , you can . - No . You did just now with me . That wasn 't so difficult , was it ? Yes , it was--it was- - - It wasn 't so hard . - Good , so you 'll tell him . Now , you were saying , uh , residue , citrus rind and nicotine . Oh , yes . An enzyme found only in Caucasians of Northern European ancestry . So our assassin is , what , a jittery orange-eater from Norway ? Uh , anyway , that winnowed our search down from 10,000 to less than 300 suspects , which I then cross-referenced with Harken 's list from the FBI , and that left us with 40 potential shooters . Gary 's checking their names for a match . That 's ... That 's great work . Thank you . That 's gonna make our job a whole lot easier . You guys need to see this . One more , son ! [ Crowd clapping and cheering ] Let 's go . Two more strikes ! Strike him out ! Yeah ! Whoo ! That 's two strikes ! Oh , no . Come on , come on , come on ! You got him , you got him ! [ Wild cheers and applause ] [ Video rewinding ] Come on , come on , come on ! You got him , you got him ! [ Wild cheers and applause ] Yes , that 's him . That 's Hicks , number seven . You sure we got the right guy ? Is that him ? Absolutely . Cameron Hicks . He 's the highest-rated marksman in the history of the corps . Never fired a shot in combat , but his testing is off the charts . Something 's wrong here . A deadly assassin working in a grocery store ? Have a nice day . A hot deadly assassin , but ... Why would he ? You 're an absolute mess , woman . - Have you no shame ? - What ? I like the blue collar look . - I know you do . - And the bad boy thing . I 'm sure . - Please , you 're just grumpy . - No , I 'm not . Yes , you 're grumpy , you should mellow . - You 're hung over . - You always drink . I had one beer and two tequila shots . Which is like breakfast for me . You drank beer for breakfast ? I like cereal . I have a special mixture . Hey , Hicks . What are you doing here ? You walked out in the middle of last shift . You never came back , you never called . Uh , no , I , uh ... Look , I just , um ... - I stepped out for a minute . - Are you on drugs , my man ? No . I 'm sorry . Company policy . Oh , come on , look , you don 't have to do this . I got no choice . Here he comes . There . There he is . He 's walking south . Okay , Gar . He--his apartment is five blocks south from here . No , his apartment . - Rachel 's at his apartment . - Yes ! - I told her , in and out . - She needed a little longer . Guys , in the field , when I give you orders , you take them . They 're my orders . Rachel , out now . Rachel , copy . Get out . Rachel , out of there now . Rachel . Rachel ! - She 's not listening . - Copy . What about her cell phone ? - Rachel ! - She 's not listening . Amateur hour ! [ Cell phone rings ] [ Ringing fades away , muffles ] There he is . Keep trying her . I 'm going in . I 'm on it . Hey , you guys , I found something . Get out of there . - What ? - Rachel , he 's coming ! - Get out of there ! - Hey ! What the hell are you doing ? Whoa ! Whoa , whoa , whoa ! - FBI ! - Hold it ! On ... the ground now ! - Okay , okay ! - Now ! Yeah , come here ! Come here ! What the hell 'd you do to my car ? Careful , Gar , okay ? [ Harken groaning ] You 've been going for five minutes . You 're spiking , okay ? Rachel , what do you hear ? [ Tires screeching , horns honking ] He 's--he 's running , uh , past a cafe , and--and there 's a street musician in front . Uh , there 's a street musician . Okay Gary , help us out . Just left the park , heading into an alley three blocks north . Okay , I 'm on it . No , you need to stay . You need to stay put . [ Tires screech ] - Cameron , just stop . - Who are you ? Wait . I 'm not gonna hurt you . Why are you chasing me ? Why are you running ? [ Panting ] I don 't know ... It 's okay . Just calm down . There you go . You must be tired . Exhausted , right ? Yeah . A little weak ? Just go to sleep . Everything will be all right . [ Distorted , echoing ] Just go to sleep . Just relax , Mr. Hicks . Whoa , whoa , Dr. Rosen ... What is this ? A lesion . It 's not more than a week old . - Prepare 50 CCs . - Okay . He shouldn 't be here , Nina . That is my point . Something 's off . Of course something 's off . I whip out my cuffs , the perp ends up in FBI or police custody . No , I mean , he had no idea why we were following him . He 's guilty , okay ? He reminds me of the people I pushed . He seemed confused , disoriented . Yeah , it 's called being a crackhead , okay ? It 's not as simple as all that . Crystal meth maybe where you 're from . - Bill ! - I don 't know , drug addicts ? Excuse me , excuse me . Nina , confused- - What do you mean ? I don 't think he knew what he was doing . You don 't think he knew what he was doing ? Bill , controlling the will of another mind is not a new trick . Hypnotists , charismatics , religious leaders- - all of them manipulate the neural structure of the brain to get their desired results , not to mention our very own Nina here . Now , normally it starts in the frontal lobe . Nina 's " pushing , " for example , causes a microseizure in this region . It 's a temporary effect , which fades in minutes . Not on me . It doesn 't work on me . You 're right , Gary , because the success of Nina 's pushing is dependent on the plasticity of the subject brain , so it 's not always effective . What does this have to do- - What does this have to do with the shooter ? This is the shooter 's brain . And here we have a mass of abnormal size . My guess is that the induction in this case is long-lasting and far more substantial . Right , so ... What the hell does this mean ? That 's a very good question , Bill . Don ? Another donut shop . Yeah , since they 've opened , I 've had to add another 20 laps to my swim . You know , half these places are just a front . We need to talk about the shooter . One on every corner . More donuts than could possibly be consumed . You know 40 % of all small businesses are owned by foreign nationals ? You know that 's simply not true . Well , it could be . We don 't know . Tell me about the shooter . He was brainwashed . Why would you say something like that ? Because it 's true . I ran an MRI . He has an abnormal growth . This isn 't good . Don , my team is at risk . You ever heard of the ghost files ? No , don 't answer . Of course not . - What ghost files ? - I never asked you that . No , I 'm asking you . - What ? - What ? Why do I feel I 'm in a Beckett play when I talk to you ? I don 't know who that is , okay ? The murders : a patsy , innocent man on the street , a perpetrator we know next to nothing about , but people end up dead . Lovely . A man we sent in to infiltrate Red Flag last year died when a taxi swerved into him , killing them both . Another one of our informants ? Gutted by his cleaning lady , who then slit her own throat . The only evidence linking these two killings ? A bump in the brain . " Not good " is a bit of an understatement . Well , I 'm sure you can handle it . I mean , you 're always telling me how special your people are , Rosen . Yes , and you could have told me about this before . " I swear on my mother 's grave " ? She was cremated . Go get the ghost before he gets someone else . [ Elevator bell dings ] [ Knock at door ] You 're late . Four minutes . I got held up . I couldn 't get a positive I.D. on any of them . Checked federal records , other sources . Even DMV . There 's nothing there . They 've been scrubbed . This will do . I have one more thing to pass on . Our superiors are worried , and they want to accelerate the schedule . I told them I work on my own schedule . I 've planned this out with extreme precision . Your arrival today has thrown everything off . It was just four minutes . I 'll tell you what , it won 't happen again . No , it won 't . This time , you will follow my instructions exactly . Follow the light , please . And back . Thank you . [ Handcuffs clank ] Who are you ? I am a doctor . My name is Lee Rosen . Can you tell me what day it is ? I 'm not telling you anything . Look , this obviously isn 't a hospital , so who exactly are you people ? What 's this ? You can trust me , Mr. Hicks . I 'm trying to help you . I 'm giving you an injection of topirimate . It interrupts messages from your basal ganglia , countering any effects of forced induction . Yeah , but I am more interested in your blackouts . You left work in the middle of the day ? How do you know about that ? What was the last thing you remember ? Please , Mr. Hicks , this is very important . What was the last thing you remember before you blacked out ? My , uh ... My phone rang , and , I don 't know , there was a sound , like a tone or something . And then ? And then , uh ... And then I don 't know . I guess it was the next day . And anything else ? Say , for example , aphasia ? Excuse me ? Difficulty reading , hearing wrong words . How could you possibly know that ? Mr. Hicks , please , in your own words , ll me what you experienced . I , uh ... I couldn 't- - I couldn 't understand what anyone was saying . All the words , even the ones on the billboards , they just kept saying the same thing ... [ Overlapping voices ] Time to kill , Hicks ? Over and over again . [ Older woman 's voice ] Time to kill . Time to kill . Look , what 's wrong with me ? - Uh , nothing . - Nothing ? If nothing 's wrong with me , why am I locked up ? You killed a man , Mr. Hicks . [ Cash register beeps ] Kill yourself . Hey , what are you doin ' ? You don 't think that stuff , man . No , no , stop , stop . That stuff 's gonna kill ya ! W-what are you doin ' ? You can 't drink that stuff ! Stop ! [ Gagging ] So you 're saying that I was brainwashed ? Yes , uh ... The aphasia is incidental . It 's a mere side effect of the location of the lesion . Look , assuming I actually believe you , why would someone do this to me ? Because you are an Alpha . I 'm a what ? You have a , uh , neurological difference that confers some exceptional advantage . But you are not alone . Everyone on this unit is just like you , Cameron . They are all Alphas . No , I 'm ... I 'm not an Alpha . Well , disregard the term for the time being . Surely you have wondered where your incredible gifts come from ? Is it normal to pitch two perfect games in a row ? Yeah , and not throw another strike until they boot my ass down to double-a ball ? No , it 's not normal , doc , but it sure as hell isn 't a gift . Well , your hyperkinesis , it 's a delicate instrument , and when it falls out of tune , it crashes . All Alpha skills come with a downside , Cameron . [ Scoffs ] I 'm sorry , okay ? - This whole thing is just ... - It 's hard to believe . Yeah , a little bit . Would you do me a favor and buy me a soda ? [ Coins clinking ] Seriously ? Yes , here . Please . But , uh , do it , uh ... Do it from here , hmm ? Come on . Look , I 'm a good shot , but that 's impossible . Well , try . [ Coin clatters on floor ] Okay ? Again . [ Coin clatters ] Look , this is stupid . Our minds are capable of so much more than you think . Again . [ Coin clangs in slot ] No . No . [ Coin clangs in slot ] You focus on the moments when your remarkable skill fails you , but the potential is there clearly . [ Chuckles ] [ Coin clinks in slot ] [ Soda drops ] What do you want from me ? You didn 't send your team out to hunt me down just to , uh , give me this little therapy session . You have barely scratched the surface of what you are capable of . Okay . So , if this " Ghost " is actually involved , how do you track him ? Well , all his former proxies are dead . Mr. Hicks would not be alive if his work were complete , if this ghost was not planning on using him again . So I answer the phone , then what ? Oh , you just go out there and kill someone else . Bill , please . Sounds like a really good plan to me . To answer your question , Mr. Hicks , Gary is our transducer , which means that he can read a wide range of frequencies , including television , Wi-Fi , and cell phone transmissions ... Except for Nokia . It 's a different protocol . So when the call comes in , Gary will trace the signal back to its source . By scanning local antenna towers , I can create a splash grid . Oh . I 'm the Cold Charlie . What ? It 's a way of flushing out snipers . You put your helmet on the end of your rifle , stick it out there . Sniper takes a shot . You clock his position , you nail him . The helmet on the end of the rifle , that 's the Cold Charlie , and that 's me , right ? He catches on quick . Well , I don 't see that we have much choice . You are aware , Mr. Hicks , that if the Gost is still out there , you are very much at risk . All right . Gary , you got a lock on his cell ? Yes , I do . I 'm not gonna argue this point . It 's a process issue , Lee . Okay ? We 're moving into a whole new line of work here . You can 't hire amateurs for this type of deal . I understand your frustration , Bill . They can 't carry firearms , the equipment is- - Needs improvement , yes . I 'm actually jotting this down as we speak . It 's , uh ... You know , it 's very constructive . " Constructive " ? Yes , I hear your concerns , and I will address them . You know what ? You 're using that shrink voice again . What voice is that ? If you keep doing that , I 'm gonna hang up on you . Are you anxious about is operation , or is it something else ... [ Phone beeps ] Water okay ? Sorry . It 's , uh , the strongest thing I got . That 's a cute kid . Is that the ex ? Yeah . It 's Patti , back when she used to put up with my crap . Comes with the territory . Yeah , Rosen gave me that speech . Of course , the whole " downside " speech . You spent more than five minutes with him , so why wouldn 't he ? Yeah ? So , uh , what 's yours ? What 's my what ? What , no , uh ... no downside for you ? Well , I don 't count toothpicks or cut myself , if that 's what you 're getting at . No , but , um ... I live rent-free in a penthouse in Soho . I do what I want , take what I need , don 't answer to anyone . Except Rosen . Yeah , I work for Rosen . Yeah , so you answer to him . It 's a job . Right , just , uh ... Just punching the clock , huh ? Look , if there 's something you want to know , you just ask . Look , I 'm just saying . Most people , if they could do what you do ... Would what ? But not you . You work with Rosen , you 're here helping me out . Maybe I 'm just a really nice person . [ Laughs ] I don 't know . Are you ? No . [ Both laugh ] [ Cell phone rings ] What do I do ? [ Ringing ] Answer it . [ Ringing ] Hello ? [ Rapid beeping ] Okay , so what do I do ? Give him the topirimate . You sure this 'll work ? Well , conceivably , one could also stimulate a primal emotional response to overwhelm the programming . Okay , whoa , whoa , whoa . Just , uh , back up , what ? Just give him the shot . Okay . [ Groans ] [ Panting ] Okay , you 're fine . Uh , Gary ? Any luck with the signal ? I got it . I 'll get in the back . [ Overlapping voices , electronic static ] - How are we doing ? - Gary 's tracking ' it . We 're close . It 's there . This is it . It 's here . It 's this . Coming from the sixth floor . - You 're sure ? - Yes . Okay , we 've got a midtown hotel location . I 'm gonna put the team in place , then move in . Copy that ? I-I 'll be right there . - Nina , with me . - Yeah . Rachel , I need you to stay here and make sure the car does not get towed . Okay . Gary , I need you to keep feeding me intel . I need to know if he moves an inch . Yes , intel . How can I help ? You can help by not killing anyone today . The guy brainwashed me . Harken , I can help . You can take these off when it 's over . Rachel . Let 's go , Nina . I 'm going up to six . Let me know when you get a room number . Can you hear me ? Uh-huh . Yes . Signal isn 't moving . I need a list of your current guests on the sixth floor ? Uh , I don 't know what that is , and I 'm gonna need a search warrant . Right . Oh . Look , here 's my search warrant right ... here . Here ... Here ... This is a search warrant . Yeah . Let me get that information for you . [ Elevator bell dings ] I need a room number , Nina . Yeah , I 'm workin ' on it Bill . Single guests , been here for longer than a week . Okay , I 'm trying . Just give me one second . [ Elevator bell dings ] [ Whispering ] I got a bellhop here . I 'm almost there , Bill . Just keep your panties on . Nina , I need the number . Okay , room 613 . Room 613 . Room 613 . That 's the room the bellman just went in . I 'm goin ' in . [ Groans ] Come on , Rachel , look , he 's gonna need some help . You gotta let me out . Please . I can 't . [ Grunts ] [ Groans ] Get down ! [ Gunshot ] [ Woman screams ] [ Gunshot ] I lost him ! West stairwell . Rachel , come on , he 's getting away ! All right . Get your guys to block all these exits . Don 't let anyone through . Excuse me , what ? Tell your guys to block these exits . Come on , get these exits blocked . - Yeah , I need this , too . - Okay . Hicks ! - I 'm on him ! - Hicks ! Hey ! Come on , come on , come on . Hicks ? I got him ! - All right , get up . - [ Groans ] Nice and easy . Nice and easy . [ Elevator bell dings ] [ Crowd exclaims , murmurs ] Down , get down , get down ! - Ohh ! - Stop ! I got him ! [ Patrons exclaiming ] Stop ! No ! Oh , my God , he just jumped . All right , copy that . What happened ? Where am I ? It 's over . You okay ? Yeah . Thanks . Yeah , any available for traffic control in midtown , gimme a 20 . [ Background chatter ] Has the victim been IDed yet ? When we have more information , we 'll let you know , ma 'am . [ Police radio chatter ] I don 't know . It doesn 't make sense to me . Why would he would jump ? You okay ? Yeah , just ... Bad memories . Right . Mm . Oh , look . Look , here 's the angle of the shot , just as you said . Every single moment was planned . Yeah . Well , I 've has several patients who have exhibited this kind of obsessive-compulsive behavior . I would like to take this with us . Gray suits . Gray suit , dark coat . Look at this . Strange that someone with such a compulsive methodology would deviate from it . Using Hicks a second time . Yes . Whoever he was after must have been extremely important . You okay ? I 'll be fine . Thanks . You did good . No , I made a mess of this thing . I should have kept it more contained . Yeah , I guess in that case , you blew it . We 're heading back to the office . Rosen wants me to stay and spin the story , so you guys go ahead . Leaving the part about the alphas and the brainwashing out ? Good luck with that . Tell me about it . Did a good job , Hicks . Thanks . Nina , I need both of you in the van , okay ? Sure . I was just trying to make sure no one got hurt , and- - Oh , I understand , Bill . Thank you . I have no idea what you 're asking me , but I don 't know . Okay ? What are you lookin ' at ? It would 've been nice to get some scans . You think so ? It also would be nice if I didn 't have every department in the city asking for explanations I can 't give . Are you upset , Don ? Home team won this one , didn 't it ? I can have two conflicting emotions at the same time , Rosen . I 'm complicated that way . And don 't think I 've forgotten about your shooter . I know how your mind works . You do ? We 're coming for him . Uh , we should talk about that . We just did . Uh , Don , he ... He was a big help to us , and I think I can help him . I don 't care . Go . Something still does not make sense . The Ghost chose proxies who were consistently average . Housekeeper , taxicab driver , man on the street . But this time , he chooses an Alpha . Hicks is the only one who makes that shot . Yes , and that 's just it . This plan is so complex and was executed perfectly . It was bound to draw some attention . Maybe he got sloppy . [ Laughs ] No . No , that is very unlikely . So what happens to Hicks ? Wilson sends him to the compound ? Oh , I don 't think so . He 's not a prisoner . And Wilson sees the distinction ? Well , there are rules , Nina . Bill is right . We simply can 't keep him here . You helped us . The man shot a federal witness . The situation is a bit more complicated . Was it complicated with me ? Nina , that was a long time ago , before any of this . You can 't compare the two . I think I just did . [ Beeping ] Who 's Tyler ? Wh - he 's my kid . He 's a pitcher . Gary , don 't read my texts . You still here ? Yeah . Rosen said he wanted to talk , so ... Maybe you should come back tomorrow . I mean , he could be a while . You think ? I 'm taking Gary home . I 'll drop you off . No , Dr. Rosen is driving me . Change of plans . We should go . Yeah , sure . [ Car alarm chirps ] [ Laughs ] Nice ride . Thanks . I borrowed it . No . No , no . Gary , you okay ? No , no . No , it 's back again . Gary , what 's back ? It 's back again . The ... The signal ! Yellow and blue ! The signal ! The signal ! Hang on do you see something ? Gary , calm down . It 's the cell phone ! The cell phone ! What ? The Ghost ? - Yes ! Yes ! - Gary , are you sure ? Yes , he 's here ! Gary , look at me . Gary . What direction ? There . He 's over there . Okay , okay , okay . Hey , take care of him . And warn Rosen ! Gary , get in the car and lock the door , okay ? I need the keys . No , just get in the car ! I 'm serious ! 10 and 2 o 'clock . [ Cell phone rings ] [ Ringing ] Hello , Don . I know what you 're going to say- - Rosen , stop . That 's not what I called about . We 've got a big problem . We got the wrong body . Guy who jumped off the roof wasn 't the ghost . It was the damn bellhop . Are you sure ? I 'm looking at him right now . Which raises the question , who was the guy in the room , and where is he now ? We had it all wrong . The whole case was a setup from the very beginning . Why else the miracle shot ? Why choose an Alpha ? We were supposed to find it . Hicks was the Cold Charlie . [ Fabric tears ] [ Gasping ] We thought we were using Hicks to draw out the ghost , but Red Flag was using him all along to identify their real target . What real target ? Come on , Don , who 's done more to disrupt Red Flag 's operations ? Who 's the biggest thorn in their side ? Us ! Okay , we don 't have the Ghost . Now the Ghost is after us . How about your man in the room , did he see him ? Rosen , what about Harken ? Can he help us out ? I 'm afraid it 's too late for that , Don . [ Screams ] Be still ! Hey ! Let her go ! Not a step closer , Mr. Hicks , or she dies . Bill ? Bill , try and hear me . Bill , I am your friend . I am your friend , Bill . I know what you 're thinking . You 're thinking you can make that shot without hitting her . - But I know you . - No , you don 't know me . I 've researched you extensively . Without my hand to guide you , you 're helpless . Every time the pressure 's on , you fall apart . I am your friend , Bill . Bill . Kill me . Please , kill us all . Stop ! Bill ? [ Echoing ] Look at me . Listen to me . Don 't do it . Don 't kill him . It 's not working , Nina . He 's ... He 's too far gone . Bill . Bill , please . You know who I am . I am your friend . Bill , please . The only way you make that shot is if I tell you to . Now , you let me go , I let her go . It 's as easy as ... [ Gunshot , bullet ricochets ] [ Rachel gasping ] Are you okay ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . [ Panting ] You 're on the wrong side of this , Hicks . What ? You 're on the wrong side of this . There are still a few traces of anomalous activity in the prefrontal cortex , but it 's substantially diminished . The lesion seems to be dissolving . And you , how are you ? I 'm gonna be okay . The side effects shouldn 't last more than a few days , but you have experienced significant trauma . And in the coming weeks , you may find emotions welling up inside you , feelings of , uh , well , sadness and , of course , fatigue . I 'll keep that in mind , Oprah . My door is always open , Bill . Thanks , Dr. Rosen . How are you ? I heard you snuck one on me . Glad to see yo back to normal . You want a ride , H. ? [ Background chatter ] [ Bat clanks ] - Oh ... - Nice hit ! [ Distant clapping ] He has your arm . Ah , not quite . Well , maybe with practice , hmm ? Maybe . Ah , it 's hard being apart from them , isn 't it ? Yeah . Yeah , but , I mean , I get it . I drive her nuts . Well , it 's not entirely your fault , is it ? Patti has no idea what you go through . Something you want to tell me , doc ? There is so much that I can do to help you , and there 's much that you can do to help us . Yeah , I know . And , look , I appreciate it . Really , I do , Dr. Rosen . I know you got my back . Well , I 'm not asking ... No , I know what you 're asking . Believe me , I get it . But I worked for the government before . Didn 't really turn out . - Well , Cameron ... - The thing is , I just , uh ... Just kind of always been better off on my own , you know ? - Of course . I completely understand . - Thanks . But you did murder a federal prisoner . Wait . I couldn 't control that . You--you of all people know that . Yes , I know that , and you know that . But there are other parties that might not be so understanding . No , the best place for you now is with us , where I can protect you . Come by tomorrow . We 'll get you situated . You 're back on the mound , Mr. Hicks .

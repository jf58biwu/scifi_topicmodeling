 Previously on Caprica ... Tomas Vergis has taken my company away from me , and I want it back . The Guatrau is having me blackmail my Graystone board of directors to get my company back . So Terry Albick . - I got nothin ' . - He 's sleeping with his sister-in-law . You 'd be surprised what comes out at corporate retreats . I think we can count on his vote . Who 's next ? I tried to help my friend Zoe , but now I 'm in way too deep . I have a small task for you . A small but important task . Clarice ? Sister Clarice ? What about her ? I want you to replace the fob on her car keys with this . - You put a bomb in her car . - No . You did , actually . Let 's see some terror . After Barnabus attempted murder , he left me no choice but to settle all S.T.O. business . Others need to be taught the price of disobedience . Are you gonna kill me ? I hope not . Clarice was such a good friend to me and now I 'm betraying her . These monotheists , they want nothing more than to have us either convert or destroy us . It 's not the monotheists , it 's the terrorists . I think your friend Clarice Willow is one . Why are you telling me this ? Because I need your help . You have intimate access to an STO leader . You want me to spy on my friend ? Is that it ? I 'm called a deathwalker because I can 't die in V-world . I 've seen the symbol around the city . It belongs to the other deathwalker . She didn 't de-res . She was shot , but she 's not de-ressing . Any ideas where she is ? I hear you can 't die , but you can bleed , and you can hurt . Look who showed up . Deathwalker ! I 'm looking for the deathwalker . You don 't find the deathwalker . She finds you . Whatever this game is , I 'm not playing it . To enter is a challenge . Rules are rules . Ave , deathwalker ! You fight or die ! Daddy , help ! You ever been shot before ? Really hurts , doesn 't it ? By the way , you found me . Lords of Kobol : Before the Fall v. 1.00 You didn 't because you 're useless ! You tried to kill us , but you didn 't because you 're useless ! Worthless ! Did you think we wouldn 't find you ? I don 't even know why Clarice wants you here . It 's okay . I won 't let the others hurt you . Cyrus , what 's going on ? What is the board doing here ? The chairman has called for an emergency vote . What emergency ? I believe it 's a motion to reinstate Daniel Graystone as the CEO . Parker , what the frack is going on ? Look me in the eye , Gods damn it ! Let 's be civil and give them the room . They 'll call when they need you . Shall we ? - You have a phone call . - Yes , put it through . Vote 's in . 14-zip . Congratulations . Why did you bring her here ? - Don 't have to answer to you , Mar-Beth . - Of course not . - The rules don 't apply to you . - Be careful what you both say . We don 't need the kids talking . Right . About the teenage girl tied up in the attic ? Speaking of which , are you almost done with Lacy ? Almost . Good . I 'm going back to Amanda at the cabin . - But why ? - Because it is what God wants . You 're back . You 're drawing the fire . Yes , when we first met . Thanks for saving me and being my friend . Welcome back . Wait . Please just listen to me . I 'm sorry . Look , I 've just ... I 've practiced this so many times in my head the last few weeks . I think you and I are the same . People say you can 't be killed . That 's true , I can 't . So , look , I think that you and I , we can bring ... So do you remember that Maglev bombing , the one that killed my mother and I ? According to that , you did it . That . Yes , that ! Help ! Please help ! They 're keeping me prisoner ! Help ! Why are you doing this ? Just let me go . I 'm gonna miss this place . Yeah , me too . Can I come home with you ? Don 't be silly . Anyway , I don 't think my family would like it . Come on . Can 't keep the cabbie waiting . You 're drugging me . You motherfrakkers . You 're drugging me ! - Want a drink ? - No , thank you . I 'm fine . We just didn 't want you to think that the transition 's over . What , you ... You want to take out Vergis ? Has to be done . According to whom , you and Sam or ... You know , the whole point of cooking up the vote was so that I could get back in somewhat legitimately . And you did , Vergis is Tauron . He 'll never lie down . If allowed to live , he 'll come back . He must be returned to the soil . And then what ? And then his brother comes after you - Sam goes after him ... - You know where this is coming to . Yeah , with someone dead . Look , let me ... Let me talk to him . Let me try and reason with him . He 's a man of business ... We speak the same language . No . You speak Caprican . Human beings value life . That 's one of the main things that makes us slightly more evolved than animals , understanding the value of life . Other things have value . All right , well , look , if I don 't at least try , then ... I 'm no better than ... Me ? Him . Hello , Amanda . This is a welcome surprise . Hello , Serge . Is Daniel here ? Not at the moment . Would you like me to ping him ? No , that 's all right . Come on . Come on . You gotta eat . You gotta be hungry . Very hungry . But the next time I eat , it 's because Clarice brings me food herself and tells me what she wants . I 'll tell her . Okay , wait , just let me explain . Yes , please explain why you deliberately slaughtered hundreds of innocent people all for your meaningless fictional god ! You took my life and my mother 's ! That wasn 't me , okay ? She died on that train . It says so here . Look , I 'm a copy , okay , just like you . You are lying ! I am not a copy ! I have all of my memories , all the feelings I had , it stands to reason you do too . It 's hard to explain . There were a lot of people who had friends and family on that train . You know that I am not original Zoe . Tell it to them , but I don 't think they care . My father was on that Maglev train . This won 't bring him back . t might feel pretty good , though . Poor thing . It 's gonna be okay . I 'm scared . I need your help , not your fear . Try to get up . If you 're like me , you 'll heal soon enough . So why won 't you fight back ? You don 't know where I 've been lately . I 'm tired of fighting . I 'm not . Maybe you won 't fight 'cause you know you deserve this . Is that true ? - Is that what you think ? - It 's you . I remember you . - Hey , dad . - Hi , sweetheart . Can I go snow-ramming with Lacy and the guys this weekend ? Sure . Sounds like fun . You know , if we buy a season pass , it actually works out being cheaper . I like the way you 're thinking . That 's like ... I used to draw those . Did you ? - Yeah . - Well , maybe I saw it and it stuck in my head somewhere , huh ? How close is it to done ? Don 't even ask . I can tell you all about it tomorrow . I am exhausted . Well , don 't stay up too late , and don 't mess with my settings . Look . Same legs . Brain 's in the chest , not the head . He 's got plenty of time for you when he wants to steal an idea . He 's not stealing anything from me . You know what would infuriate him ? Beating him at the thing he 's best at . I don 't want to beat him . Besides ... I can design a chassis . It 's not the same as making a robot . Think of something bigger . And what would I create ? Life 's a good start , I think . Come on ! Oh , God . Let it be that I got this right . That 's okay . You don 't have to talk yet . You 're brand new . God , if I did this right , you 're me . Welcome to the world . V-world anyway . I can talk . You can talk ? I 'm you , right ? I have your memories . I can feel them . And you can talk . Right , but I 'm still gonna have to make you take some tests . Memory tests , like profile stuff , just to see how good you are . Good idea . I don 't remember making me , so that could already be a possible problem . No , that 's okay . You won 't remember anything that happened since I last scanned myself . Don 't worry . I think you 're probably perfect . A perfect copy . Right now , yeah . But what I meant is ... perfectly alive . Starting right now , you 're a person . But I can 't leave V-world . A person with restricted movement is still a person . Come over here . Let 's test you out a little bit . You 're not her . You 're not the same . You keep walking in her footprints even after her footprints stopped , but you didn 't have to . Even she knew that . Now , are you gonna lie down and pay for her sins ? Or are you gonna own yourself ? I don 't care if you 're not the original Zoe . For now , you 're more alive that she is , and you deserve all you 're getting . I think you have me confused with someone else . - Are you ready to talk to me now ? - You never asked me anything . Why ? I didn 't know if I could trust you . I still don 't . Where do you get off being all moral ? You killed my friends . For all I know , you killed Zoe too . You were the one who tried to blow me up . I didn 't want to do that . That would have sounded very moving at my funeral . There wouldn 't have been a dry eye in the house . And for the record , I would never have harmed Zoe . Now to show you meant me no harm , you need to help me . Zoe 's resurrection program , it was uploaded from her computer after she died . What happened to it ? She 's gone , Lacy . This is not a betrayal . She would want you to help me . We were working together . And if you do tell me ... your burden will be lifted . The avatar lived on . She was ... She was inside one of her dad 's robots . Where is it now ? Destroyed . It crashed and she disappeared . She 's gone , and so 's the program . Wasn 't there a backup ? Not that I know of . Zoe was very careful . She wouldn 't have been so unprepared . Think , Lacy . Wait . She had a pin . It was shaped ... like an infinity symbol . I don 't know , there was some way she kept stuff in there . A compartment , could have been data . You sure ? If she had a backup , that 's where she would have kept it . Thank you . What happens now ? That 's a good question . The way my husbands are feeling about you right now , I think it would be very healthy for you to go off-world . Off-world ? There 's a program on Gemenon , training for STO recruits . It 'll help you get ... properly focused on your walk with God . I can 't go to Gemenon . - My mom . - We 'll take care of her . Now clean yourself up and Olaf will ... drive you to the spaceport . Listen to me carefully , Lacy . I am trying ... to save your life . Do you understand ? There 's been enough blood . ... downstairs and clean her up and don 't let anybody see her . Clarice Willow is here to see you . I wasn 't expecting to see you so soon . I haven 't even seen Daniel yet . I was thinking about you rattling about this place all on your own , and I was worried . I 'm fine . Really . I wonder if you 'll be able to get all her things back now . I don 't want her things . Memories are attached to things , don 't you think ? If you had her ... all her trinkets and jewelry and ... You know , little personal things , the things the GDD confiscated , that might trigger good memories of Zoe . I came across something she gave me the other day , a diary . She gave you her diary ? Yeah , but it was ... It was blank one for me ... to use . And she said to me to record all my good deeds in it , and I said , that sounds a little bit too much like hubris . Shouldn 't I record all my bad deeds in it ? And ... she said , she should have gotten me a bigger book . That sounds just like her . Clarice , maybe that 's why we were brought together . Some kind of destiny , some way of keeping Zoe alive . I think it 's why I wanted to come and stay with you so badly . I just have this feeling that there 's more . Have you unpacked yet ? They 're this way . Everybody , this is Amanda Graystone . She 'll stay with us for a while . Get her ! What are you gonna do ? You gonna kill me ? Have you not been paying attention ? Neither one of us can die ! Finish her ! Make her bleed ! It 's a one-way ticket , but I know you 'll be back . I can 't wait . I remember you from the dark room . I know how scared you were . - We 're nothing alike ! - We are ! You have great abilities here ! Why get caught up in this like all of them ? - You 're better than this . - I 'm tired ... Of listening to all ... Of your crap ! That girl I was , that girl you remember , she 's gone ! You put me here ! So stop talking ! See , I get that on a personal level . That girl is gone , so what does this girl like - and what does this girl hate ? - They like watching your pain . Come on ! They don 't care which one of us bleeds . Look at them . Is that what you want to be ? Entertainment ? New Cap City is disgusting . It 's a place for the people to come and act out their own worst impulses . To kill , rape , destroy . It 's wrong ! - Why do you care ? - I have a purpose , and I know that now . And I think this is it or a step on the way . I don 't know . But I think you 're supposed to help me . I 'm glad you agreed to come , Tomas . I want you to know that I 've spoken to the board , and they are drawing up a severance agreement as we speak . So I should slink back to the Tauron dirt where I belong . No . Look at this contract . I 've given you a lot more than I had to . You 're going to make a big , fat profit on this entire affair . Think I want your charity ? It 's not charity . It is a begrudging gesture or respect . You played me well . Caught me napping and took advantage . I turned the tables , that 's the game . Let 's shake hands and live to fight another day . Frakkin ' Capricans . Where are your stones ? You know how this has to end ? This is business , Tomas . Just business , nothing more . Actually , it 's a little bit more than that to me . You made a deal with the Ha 'la 'tha , with Taurons . And whatever your fine principles , they will not let me live . So , Why not now ? You made me dead . Finish the job . I invite you to my home ... And you bring a weapon . I 'm extending an olive branch to put an end to the bloodshed . Whatever they have told you , they are obligated to kill me . - The Guatrau will accept nothing less . - He isn 't an unreasonable man . You do not reason with the Guatrau . I will not make it off-world alive , I accept that . " Control your return to the soil , " meaning plan your death . I am Tauron . It is important to me to die at the moment and time of my choosing . I choose here , now , at the hands of my enemy . Well ... That ... That isn 't going to happen . The Ha 'la 'tha , they are a group of small-minded , vicious thugs , no more , with some amount of power . Correct . But you and I , we have resources beyond anyone 's wildest imagining . I propose a pact . Graystone and Vergis , we combine efforts , we protect each other , and we devote our resources toward the total destruction of the Ha 'la 'tha . We can do it . At the very least , we can ... put them on the run , drive them underground . - Return them to the soil . - Yes . Maybe I was wrong . I overreacted . We 're both powerful men . - Think what we can accomplish together . - Exactly . It was my father 's . His father 's before him , so on . Swear an oath on this blade and we will be brothers . Hello . Joseph , it 's Daniel . I need your help .

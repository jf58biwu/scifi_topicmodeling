 I do not want them ! What are you doing ? Do not touch me ! There are too many Hubots here . - We 're getting rid of Vera . - Vera ? The only one that does anything ! God created animals and people . You are a child of David , not God . - Why won 't he ... ? - Someone has taken out the brain . - I love you . - Will you marry me ? You will be discovered . And I 'll lose you . We 'll live happily ever after - like in the fairy tales . There are pieces of code that will get my life back - through him . The start up on it does not work . - There 's nothing wrong with him . - The brain is missing . Nothing wrong except that the brain is missing . Who would do something like this ? The brain center is gone . Maybe you have some information about it - Were you at David 's funeral ? - I was waiting outside . Who was there ? Mrs. Greta , the priest , and a woman . - Who was the woman ? - I do not know her name . Niska ... - Niska . - It 's me . I 'm not calling because I want to have something to do with you . Get it ? Why is Eischer Transhumanology written on your address ? Mom ... Mom ! Many couples want to have a " traditional wedding " without talking about God . - Albert ... Albert ... - But we talk about God . I 'm glad you 're not one of those couples . We are very traditional . Should I take him ? Come . - Children are a gift . - I really love children . Albert ! - Sorry . - Albert ! - He 's a little ... - Albert , you must not do that . Albert ! When we have sung a hymn , I 'll read from Corinthians . After that ... . Let go ! - Release ! - Release ! When we were talking about keeping secrets . That 's one of those . Do not tell . - Shake - What does that mean ? - A promise . - A super promise . Good . - I 'm hungry .. for pizza . - Again ? All right . I 'll just go inside . - What should I say ? - Can 't I love Florentine ? Yeah , but it 's a lie . Florentine is the best thing that has happened to me . Before we met , I was restless . But now I know where I 'm going . - Do you know what I hear ? - No . I hear someone who has a hard time being himself . All is not right just because it feels right . So I 'm lying to myself ? He thinks that what I feel is wrong . - That it is I who can not love . - Florentine can love me . How do I know that you do not have this just programmed into it ? Because she is able to have feelings . Okay ? You can trust me . Do you believe us or not ? I do not know . I can not give you a good answer right now . - I need help . - I can help . - Not with this one , Odi . - I can do a lot , even drive . What 's next ? There are new units to be picked up . Can you get them ? Here 's the addresses . I can lift heavy things , push buttons , pull levers ... - I 'll take the second location . - I can wash dishes , cook lasagna ... - Can you be quiet ? Good . - And I can talk and sing . - I can mimic sounds . - Odi ... Odi ... Odi ! - Play on the computer . - I can play on the computer . - He owns us , so he deals just with me . - It sounds like ... Yes , they are buying them . Perfectly legal . Ya . Why did not you take this one ? Because it 's ... On my street . - See you . - This is good , Odi . - It 's good , Odi . Vera , they 're here now . Vera ! Come ! It 's time for me to say goodbye now Lennart . Yes , yes . Goodbye . What does Mimi think ? - Shouldn 't we ask her ? - And ask what ? If it 's David Eischers code ... It could change everything . Yeah , but look . The end of the code is missing . Yes , that seems to be missing ... Somebody took it or something . But ... What do you think ? When Mom had Leo as client ... There was an important message that only Mimi saw . Can it be anything ? - I can ask her . - Nah , I 'll do it . - Hey ... - Learn to knock ! Sorry . Vera is going now . It would be nice if you said goodbye . - Bye , Vera ! - Goodbye , kids . Bye Vera . Have a good time ! Alright , then we 're done here . Vera is a geriatric Hub so she can do CPR and other stuff like that . Maybe she can help in the park . She has a driviers license for heavy vehicles . - If there was nothing more , so ... - I have not finished vacuuming . The vacuum cleaner is not put away . Vera , this is Silas . Now you do as he says . He ​ ​ is your new owner . You see ... ah ... There are too many Hubots in this house now . Do you have more ? Not that are for sale . I understand If you change your mind ... - Just give me a call . - Thank you . Come on . Jump in there . What the hell ... Where the ... What the hell is she doing ? Yeah ? Move then . - Where did Vera go ? - To a theme park . Here ... " Hub Battle Land " . It seems a bit funny to be named that . Mimi ! Remember when Mom gave you a note from Leo ? - Yes . - Is it still here ? No . I memorized it . What was on it ? It was a part of David Eischers code , right ? David called it the " key " , but it is useless on its own . I think we have the rest of the code . How did you get it ? We do not know if that 's what it is . - Want to check ? - No . Anyway ... We would like to borrow the " key " . - Do you understand what the code does ? - Yes . - It made you . - And what am I ? - You are amazing . - No . Forget the code , Tobbe . Do not possess it . Hello ? Hello ? Hi . I here to pickup a unit . - Is there anything you like ? - Hell no . Silas sent me to retrieve a Hub . That 's the one . We would have extended the contract . Silas didn 't want to . He ​ ​ wants it himself . Uh ! - Roger . - How did you get that ? - We rented it from you . - What have you done with Therese ? - Shut it down . - It is better if it walks to the car . Is Therese okay ? - Shut it down , please . - It 's not my back that will hurt . Rick ... Sit down . Good . Rick , do you remember what we used to do ? Aww , hands up ! It can be a little aggressive when you turn it off . But it is easily fooled , when you want it quiet . It was that way when we got it . Sure . I know exactly how that works . Per , help this guy down the drive . See you later . It 's me learning to cycle . It 's me and my dad . It was the night before Christmas Eve . I did not want to go to bed . Dad let me stay up and watch television and eat gingerbread . - Why did we stay up ? - It 's not important . We longed for someone . - Who ? - Nevermind ... She never came . - Were we sad when she did not come ? - No ! Dad took care of us . He gave us what we needed . Look at me , so you learn who to be . The chances were that it needed a battery . I checked and it came ... - What are you programming the lady for ? - Human Shield , civilian with children . Soon . So there . Done ! Good . Don 't be scared of the place . Where is my child ? - Let go ! - It hurts ! - Do something ! - I 'm trying . - What have you done with my child ? - Give her the baby ! Odi-Odi , give me the baby ! Let go ! - it hurts ! Damn ! - I can do it myself . - I know , but drop it . - Let go ! - Here 's your baby ! Here ! You can adjust the strength of the grasp . She 's going to be a victim , not a killing machine . I 'll fix it . - What did you program into that ? - Officer , or so I thought . We 'll see . It didn 't retain it . I 'll try again . I 'll just have adjust the levels . You might want to grab a beer first ? Hell , yeah . I called my Mom the other day . Yeah ? I have not talked to her in 20 years . My Mom panics when she doesn 't hear from me for six months . " Silas , you never call . " " Come and see me ! " At least she didn 't abandon you when you were seven years old . No . - Why did you call ? - I had to . - She has the code . - Does she know that ... ? - What happened to ... ? - That I look like this ? She knows nothing . When she sees this place she 'll be proud of you . She hates Hubots . She hates them more than she loves her family . She blames dad , because he walked out . Am I crazy ? Because I do not want to forgive her . She abandoned me ! - I can 't ever forget it . - You 're not crazy . Thank you . Thanks for the beer , I ... - Don 't you want another one ? - No , it 's fine . I just have to go ... - This is Niska . - I want meet with you . " For the future I see two options . " " One where Hubots take over the world . A world where people do not " ... When I think of the future , I see two options . Nah . When I ... two opt ... When I think of the future I see two options . First , a world where Hubots have taken over and people are not worth anything . The other is a future where humans have taken power over the Hubot industry where we are not slaves to their greed , but all have jobs . This requires new laws . Therefore , I want to see real humans in the parliament ! - What 's good . - You 're here so early ? - Yes , we are practiceing a bit . Kevin , a question . Have you been told how and when we go to the camp ? - Yes . - I was just a little unsure . We have not received your registration fee . I know ... Can I bring my money there ? We locked in the number of participants yesterday . My dad just got a new job , but you will get the money . I promise . - I 'll fix it . - Absolutely . - I 'm not made of money . - It 's 500 bucks ! It 's nothing . - Nothing ... - No , no . - What do you need this for ? - A thing . - Why don 't you ask your mom ? - Forget I said anything . Kev ! - Kev ! - What is it ? Have you talked to Therese ? I know she is sorry for everything that happened . - Rick is certainly also very sad . - She has left Rick . - She says she has . - No , I know . - Call her . She is still your mother . - We 'll see . She would be very happy . Okay , I 'll call her . - If you nag maybe I will change my mind . - Sorry . What the hell ... What the hell . It 's connected . Come on , dammit ! I 'm sorry that it takes so long . I 'm almost done . Gordon . I do not know if I believe in God anymore . I would like to erase the Bible . You can delete the Bible , but not God . He 's there nonetheless . He loves you . I do not want him to love me ! I think I hate him . I do not understand . It was a mistake - the whole thing . I am a child of David . Gordon . I am a child of David ... David 's child ... David 's children ... I 'm sorry to show up like this . A couple of weeks ago I was contacted by a couple who wanted to marry . - Can we sit down ? - Sure . Please do . - They asked for a traditional wedding . - They came to the right person . That was stupid for me to say ... Continue . We booked dates , and today we had the rehearsal . She is a Hubot . She states ... and I understand how it sounds . She says she is " released " . Have you ever heard of anything like that ? - Do you think they love each other ? - I do not know . I think I almost believe her , when she says she is released . For love is from God , and each who loves is born of God ... - ... And knows God . - But , Asa ... I 'm not like you . I was saved when I was ten years old . I think the word : That God created man and woman in his own image . And who created Hubots ? The Devil ? God created man with free will . not artificial Hubots ... Hubots are not God 's will . I think they are a consequence of the fall . Who gave this Hubot freewill if it was not God ? - It 's my sister . - How dramatic you are . My sister ! - There are many Hubots , Gordon . - Not that are released . It 's Flash . In this case , it is wonderful . If she has found someone . Be happy for her . Hi . Come in . Yes , mom . - Nice ... - I 'll see how long I stay . - The water is boiling . - Shit ! - It 's only water . - Sorry , I 'm just ... I could hardly believe it when you called . I thought you did not want any contact . I was angry when you did not let me see dad . Or Roger ... And then you and your Hub all over each other all the time . Roger told me that you ... you do not have Rick . Is that true ? Yes . Good . I have baked a little . I have to be honest about something and I want you to be open-minded and try to understand , Okay ? - You do not have to sound so nervous . - Oh . Have you got a new Hubot ? Yes . His name is Liam and we are thinking of moving abroad . He 's kind , Kevin . Ke ... . van Damn , damn ... Wash . Are you moving now or this summer ? - Why you ask ? - I might hang out . - Seriously ? - Why not ? - I was scared ... - For what ? - I know you were in the Real Youth . - Not anymore . They got to be too much . - I missed you . - Can I borrow some money from you ? It 's possible . How much do you need ? 500 ... Sorry , 700 . - Thank you . - Bye . - How 's it going ? - I 've downloaded the program . It took a hell of a long time . I 'll just boot him . - Can it remember where it was before ? - Naa ... I rebooted his system completely . Otherwise , it was stuck running the old program . - My name is Silas . - Where am I ? This is the stable where you live . I Live ? Is that what you call it ? Yes . I see . I can play your games . Come , I 'll show you your place . Come ! Here is your place . You go in there . Come . In here . Turn around . Who 's in charge of this detention center ? You ! ... Who makes the decisions here ? Silas . Who 's in charge over him ? Jonas . And Roger . Hi . Have you seen the priest ? - You should not see me yet ! - He does not answer the phone . - He 's coming . - He 's paid to be here NOW . - He 's coming . - Yes , but you ... I do not get this . A late priest . Damn ... Sorry . - Hans , have you seen my silver pumps ? - They 're at my old job . I had them as indoor shoes when I wanted to be a bit stylish . - You look good . - So do you . What are we going to do there ? I don 't know them ! When the boss 's son is getting married , you go . - Don 't they have their own friends ? Ouch ! - Silver shoes ! - Have you asked Matilda ? - Matilda ! - Have you seen ... - Hans Engman . Yeah , hi . - Why would I take your old lady shoes ? - They are not here ! Oh-no We leave in a few minutes ! - Haven 't you changed ? We 're going now . - I will not go . - Do not worry . You are with us . - Honey ! Sofia 's babysitter phoned . She 's sick . I 'll stay at home , so you can go . I might not be so keen either , but we have accepted . - Let 's go . - Hmm . But ... - You can not always do what you want . - But Sophia , what do we do with her ? - My Dad . - No ! Then he will become a problem again . Do not use Sofia as an excuse because you do not want to go . - Please , wait now . - Now we 'll startup my Dad . It 's fine . Look out then , I going to start it . Put that thing away . - You should take care of ... - Sofia ! How fast you were . Daddy will help you . Oh there they are ! Sit down , so I can put on my shoes . - I 'll guard Sophia . - You look great . - It 's pinching me here . - Shall we go , then ? - Yes . Mom will be ready now . - Why can 't I come ? - At last , someone who wants to come along . - You should be home with me . Let 's go ! - Bye , Grandpa ! - Do you want me to stay with you ? - Why would I want that ? - Hans , come on ! Are you coming in ? Gordon ! This is wrong ! - You 're hurting me ! - Do not go in . David 's children should not intermarry with people . I do not know what 's with you , but the way you are now ... I think we should go opposite directions . I have to go in now . Hi . - He 's not answering ? - No . It 's crazy . - Hello . - Hello . - I 'm Asa . - Douglas . - Florentine . - Florentine ? Your priest did not feel completely comfortable , so he asked me to marry you . - Is that acceptable ? - OK . - Then I 'll go and prepare myself . Good . - Okay ? - Have you seen my bouquet ? Where is it ? - Basement or attic ? - We charge first . - Jonas ! - Do not come any closer . - What do you want ? - I need David 's research . - I do not have it . - You own Eischer Transhumanology ! I 'm just a name on a paper . All David 's data was lost in the fire . - The code also ? - Why do you need that ? This body may die , but my consciousness will live on . - In a Hubot ? You can not do that . - It will happen . Look at me . See how I look ! - We are who we are . - This is no life ! There is no going back . Believe me . You can not tell me what to do ! Help me ! Save me . I wish I could . Jonas ! You must forget about code ! It is dangerous ! - There is no electricity . - Not here either . There is no power . We have always been known for our progress . We are the first agency that has hired a legal analyist Hubot - Mimi here . - You worked with insurance , right ? - At the bank . I am between business cards now . I see . The same thing happened to my cousin . He worked for 15 years ... Suddenly one day ... poof ! I think my wife wants something . - How long do we stay ? - Not long . For dinner and danceing ... It willl be ... . err ... five hours . Five ? ! Forget about me being sober . You get to drive home . You can stand out there , and then you will enter . - Okay . - You can now begin . - You need to dance . - Why ? - It 's a dance competition . - How do you do that ? It 's moving . - Not like that ! - How do I do it then ? Wait ! I have an idea . - What are you doing now ? - We 'll teach you to dance . Grandpa ! Grandpa , Grandpa . Grandpa ! Grandpa ... ! Macka ? Hello ? The old woman ? Huh ? I can not hear . I have to go away . There is music here . Sorry . Now I can hear . What are you saying , honey ? What ? You , darling , do the following : Take a deep breath and tell me what happened . What do you mean he ... ? Yes . But sweetie , calm down . Do you need to recharge ? I got a little overheated . Don 't worry . I 'll go out and get some air . I will be back soon . She just got a bit dizzy . It easily happens when you dance with me . We showed how it 's done . Now I 'll just say : The floor is yours ! That was so good ! No , she phoned . Your dad has a problem ... He 's acting strange . We must dance once first . No ! She is crying . Your dad has busted some flower ... We need to go home ! Find Tobias . We need to go home . She is heartbroken . - What are you doing here ? - We must escape before they find us . - No ! - Come on , Flash . I 'm no longer Flash . Flash is your name . You are a child of David . Now my name is Florentine . We should not mix with people anymore . I 've found you . I have saved you . Now we 'll never die . Now we will rule . I do not want to rule .

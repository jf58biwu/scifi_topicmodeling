 A brain injury caused her to lapse into a coma . Trapped inside your own brain . Expensive , and insurance won 't cover it . The Jefferson Institute is one of only two facilities in the entire country that specializes in the care of patients in an advanced vegetative state . The institute can house these patients for a fraction of what it would cost a conventional hospital . Jefferson wouldn 't let us in . So we broke in . Room after room ... empty . What kind of hospital has no bodies ? What we did find , we can 't explain . Then the guards came . - Hey , hey , stop . - Hurry . I 'm coming . - Go , go , go . - Let 's get out of here . Thanks , hon . - Just in time . - Here you go . - Good morning , everyone . - Morning . Oh ! - Sweet . - Gang , let 's rock and roll . Watch the game last night , Chambers ? Fourth quarter ... wild one . Dr. Taylor 's got season tickets . How was it , Doc ? My son-in-law used ' em . You know how it is ... never enough time in the day . I don 't think I 've seen one game this year . I got stuck at an ethics board meeting , then a fund-raiser . Caught the last two minutes on the ride home , though . All right , that is the last of the fibroids . And we 're good . Losing a lot of blood , Doc ? Not more than 100cc 's . Nice color , very nice . Why ? Pressure is 80 / 58 , dropping . Turn the music off . What ? How can that be ? I don 't know . Give me a second . It 's not coming from me . This doesn 't make any sense . I ... - Talk to me , Ramirez . - Heart rate is out of whack . Eyes ? Fixed and dilated . I 'm showing zero brain activity . Damn it . You . You ! - I 'm talking to you . - What are you doing ? This must stop . Okay . Okay . It 's okay . I was doing nothing ! He came at me ! You saw it ! Dr. Taylor , just the man I 'm looking for . You got a second ? - Don 't let ' em get to you , Mark . - Sir ? Hey , Doc . Oh , thank you very much . Hi , honey . How was work ? - Hi , sweetheart . - Hey , Dad . Is it fair that I 'm working at the hospital and here ? The people are going to rise up one day . I didn 't pick my parents , you know . I 'll do the grocery shopping this week , okay ? Yeah , you 'd better unless you want us surviving on berries and worms . - Aah ! - Susan . Miss , can you hear me ? Can you hear me ? There you go . Are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Good , good . Oh . - Mom . - Call 911 . - Thanks . - You 're very welcome . Anyway , it was so scary . I thought I was going to have to find myself a new roommate . I know . The weirdest part was opening my eyes and having some strange guy over me . That was weird for you ? Speaking of which , looks like someone 's trying to get your attention . Okay . I 'll take the guy from the pool any day . Oh , come on . - You 've got good eyes . - That 's why I 'm going into ophthalmology . Seriously , you want me to get the number of the mouth-to-mouth guy ? - No , don 't you dare . Don 't . - Come on . I can break in his locker at the pool , tell you if he wears boxers or briefs . Don 't worry . You 'll do great . I 'm on six if you need me . Montoya ? I 'm ... uh , Paul Carpin . I 'm a medical student . I 'm supposed to report to the head nurse . Sylvi , lady in 514 yanked out her line again . Someone find Cartwright . Nurse , I need some help . Hi . Is this the surgical rotation ? Did you find him yet ? What 's her problem ? That 's actually considered pleasant for Montoya . - Okay . - And yes , this is the , uh , surgical rotation . - New student ? - Transfer from New York . Hey , guys . Um ... hi . You , how is your head ? It 's better . Thanks . Good . I 'm glad . Uh , my name is Mark Bellows . - I know you . - From the Georgia Yacht Club . - Paul Carpin , sir . - Good to see you . Call me Mark ... in front of patients , Dr. Bellows . - Hanna Goldberg . - Hi , Hanna . - Geoffrey Fairweather . - Hi . - Susan Wheeler . - Ah , you 're the Wheeler . Like , as in this building ... the Wheeler Pavilion ? Townes Wheeler performed the very first open-heart surgery in Atlanta . My grandfather . That was back when they named buildings to honor people , not just to shake them down . Well , welcome , Susan . A legacy will get you in , but only hard work will keep you here . Okay , show of hands ... how many of you are absolutely certain that you want to be surgeons ? Congratulations . You screwed up already . They didn 't tell you ? Never do your first rotation in your chosen field . Use the ones you don 't care about to gain experience . Follow me . Hi . Hi . You all right ? I don 't know where I am . Okay . Okay , let me see . Okay , Mrs. Danner , I 'm sure somebody will be here any second . You just breathe . Okay , guys , there is a liver resection happening in O.R. 4 , so let 's go . I 'm coming . Okay , kids , showtime . They said I had Alzheimer 's , and I don 't , and they left me out here . Okay , I 'm here with you now , right ? Okay , - Mrs ... - Danner . Danner . We 're going to take you downstairs . Okay , listen , I don 't want to cause any trouble or anything , but I just don 't think she should be left alone . Okay , sure . Hey , uh , Geoffrey , could you , um , help me out here for a second ? - Thanks . - Yeah . Oh , man . What did you need ? Could you just hand me one of those scrub brushes up there ? You 're tall . - There . - Thanks . Sorry to keep you waiting . How have you been feeling ? Have you been taking your medication ? Would you say I 've been helpful to you , Arno ? I feel like I 've been very protective toward you , maybe too protective . No . Have you been seeing the trees ? The trees ain 't real . I make the trees in my dreams . The girl ain 't real , either . Fairweather , do a neuro check . Hi , Mrs. Sands . This is Dr. Bellows . You 're looking well . Guys , the patient 's name is Marla Sands . She was brought in on the 21st with nausea , fatigue , weakness and vomiting . Susan . - Would you like to do the honors ? - Sure . Mrs. Sands , this is gonna take care of your nausea , okay ? I find that if you pinch the patient 's arm , they barely feel a thing . Here you go . Okay . - I 'm sorry . - Oh , geez , I got it . If you drop it , they won 't feel it at all . Don 't worry . It happens to the best of us , Susan . Here you go . Simple . Very good . Follow me . Give me one second . Sorry , you have to leave now . The surgical team 's doing rounds late . Sorry . That 's okay . Okay , guys . Oh , my God . I know her . Susan ? I ... I see her at the pool . What happened to her ? She was diagnosed with simple fibroid tumors . After a successful histeroscopy , she lapsed into a coma . - Common procedure . - What ? Incidents of coma after anesthesia are one in 8,000 . Now , I was not there for this case , but I have been in the room when it 's happened before , and ... trust me , it 's not something you ever want to experience . In three days , Nancy 's coverage for in-hospital care will end . Jefferson is the only facility your insurance will approve for long-term care . Honestly , Mrs. Greenly , your daughter will receive more attention and have a better chance of recovering ... at J ... at Jefferson . Hey . I used to see her at the pool . Yeah , she ... she loves swimming . Or loved swimming . She seems so nice , and , you know , I know she didn 't deserve this . Not that anyone deserves this , but ... Well , it 's what you people did to her . She was perfectly healthy . Friend of yours or something ? - That 's Nancy Greenly 's fianc√© . - Mmm . I 'm just trying to understand it . How do I get access to her admittance record and surgical chart ? You can 't , honey . Hospital guidelines restrict students ' access to the records . And the op report is not available in the chart yet . Anyone asks , I 'll tell them you stole my I.D. Okay , what if I want to look up other cases like hers ? You can narrow your total down by length of stay , but after that ... you still have to go through it one case at a time . We missed you last night . The entire board was there . I had a patient tear open some sutures . I couldn 't get away . Get your priorities straight , Mark . If the board doesn 't think you 're serious , they 'll go with another candidate . Oh , come on , admit it , you only wanted me there to help you push through the next phase of your Alzheimer 's study . Yes . - But I also like you , and I 'm trying to help you . - Uh-huh . And yes , Stark fails to see the value of my study . Well , I 'll be there next week , scout 's honor . I appreciate everything you 're doing for me . Uh , hey , Susan . Listen , um ... when I ask you to join me in the operating room , here 's the thing ... I 'm not really asking you ; I 'm telling you . A patient needed someone to stay with her ... I understand , but this is a factory , and if you walk away from the assembly line , there will be consequences , okay ? And you can 't get attached to every patient that comes in here . If you do , you won 't last long . Let 's leave that for the nurses and the families and the volunteers , okay ? Thanks . And , Susan ? You should have let Fairweather pass out in the O.R. He wouldn 't have done the same thing for you . Why are there so many comas ? I don 't know . I mean , it seems like a lot , doesn 't it ? Only coma cases go to Jefferson , right ? I 'll leave a note for the head nurse . She can ask the doctors to look into it . Go home . Hey , Nancy . How is it out there ? Rowdy as ever . Same as usual . - See you later . - Bye . There have always been two types of doctors ... those who attend the ill and those who research in the hope of curing all ills . The cost of quality care versus the cost of research , and both , sadly , are addicted to profit . Through research , we can discover cures for many illnesses , making the human race itself healthier ... Uh ... the remodeling is not until next year , Mr. Fairweather . Uh , yes , sir . Sorry . Thank you . Now , is it ethical to spend a smaller amount on those less likely to benefit from a procedure ... - You look exhausted . - Or is it better - I know . I ... I haven 't been home . - to sacrifice that patient and his well-being for the greater good of the community ? Notes ? Mr. Fairweather . Uh , if we can 't cure , aren 't we only really biding time until the inevitable ? Yeah , and who decides ? The doctor , the patient or the insurer ? Well , obviously , we 're the only ones in a real position to evaluate the chances of success versus the ultimate cost . Excellent questions for next week 's class . Susan , I 'm so glad you came . Your grandfather would be proud . - You had a question . - Isn 't it our job to do what 's best for our patients ? Yes . But ... the irony is that we have done our job too well , and we live in an aging society . Is it right to devote resources to those who will succumb to some ailment or other , or is it sensible to discover cures for your children so they 'll have ... better lives ? Stark does this every year just to prove how much money he has ? Stark doesn 't take a cent from Memorial . Really ? The Starks were bankers . Almost totally wiped out by the Civil War . They lost a bundle in loans against slaves . Mortgaging human beings ? Quaint . Divorced 12 years ago , not long after his daughter died of juvenile diabetes . No family left . He lives all alone in what 's practically a castle . If I 'm gonna marry this guy , I think I 'm allowed to Google him . Thanks . Wow . Wish me luck . Okay . Good luck . - Quadruple bypass , ' 06 . - Quacks at Mercy didn 't give me a chance . I wouldn 't be standing here today had it not been for Stark . One hell of a doctor . You sure this isn 't a fund-raiser ? Every time you throw a party , it costs my clients a fortune . I think we 've made your clients more than they 'll ever be able to give away . But they didn 't even call you in - for a review ? - I 'm not going to call myself in - for a review . - Yeah , but a coma ? Are you kidding me ? Nelson thought I took too long stitching up a hernia . He had me in front of the ethics board the next day . Hey . How you doing ? Did you hit that yet ? Uh , no , I did not . But go for it , knock yourself out . Could be the fastest way to the top . - Have another drink , Chandler . - I 'm just saying . Nice party , huh ? Yes . We should have more events like this . I think it 's important to remember , especially as a student , that there is life outside the hospital . A life ? I 'm still trying to figure out when I 'm supposed to sleep . I thought you were doing that - during surgery . - You 'll have to excuse him , Dr. Lindquist . Paul 's a little on the competitive side . We 're wired to compete . Our ancestors competed for food , for shelter , for mates . And those who couldn 't didn 't survive . Yeah , it 's how we distinguish the best from the rest , Fairweather . Best from the rest . Oh , well , it rhymes , so it must be true . Fool , tool . See ? I did it , too . Hey , Susan . Over here . Have you met Susan Wheeler ? This is one of the smartest students we have . Susan , this is Dr. Lindquist . She 's the head of psychiatry with a PhD - in neuroscience . - Hi . Wow . A brain surgeon who knows what you 're thinking . What field do you hope to go in , Susan ? Neurosurgery . Well , it 's always nice to have fresh blood . If you make the cut . Welcome to Memorial . That was , like , really intense , right ? Uh , you think ? I was dying . Say the wrong thing to the wrong department head , you end up in proctology . And Carpin was really into her . Yeah , well , he 's an elitist and a sociopath . Most doctors are only one or the other . He 's the whole package ... most likely to succeed . Yeah . I 'm not really sure I 'm fitting in here . Uh , you don 't . Trust me . I don 't , either . - You 're smart , you 're nice . - Hmm . These people are monsters . They 're Southerners . I 'm gonna get another drink . You want one ? - Oh , no . I 'm fine , thank you . - All right . Is this seat taken ? Oh . Sure . No , it 's not . Thanks . You know ... I never properly thanked you for saving my life the other day and ... No , you didn 't . Are you going to now ? Did you know Nancy Greenly ? - It 's hard to believe , right ? - Right . It 's really scary . I better go check on my roommate . That sounds like a good idea . Make sure she 's still standing upright . I 'll see you tomorrow . Okay . You look too young to be a doctor . That 's ' cause I 'm a med student . Ah . That 's why you look so tired . Beginning to think it was my fault . Oh , actually , you can 't use that in here . Sorry . Oh , it 's okay . Something wrong with it anyway . - What 's that ? - Your number isn 't in it . It says there were some tests ordered here , but there 's no doctor listed . It just says , " Admin . " It 's probably Dr. Anything-for-a-buck , M.D. - Anyone mention what these tests were for ? - Who knows ? Dr. Cartwright did the surgery on my knee last time . I mean , what do you test for - when you have torn ligaments anyway ? - Hmm . So , you 're not married or engaged or anything , are you ? So , the only medication you 're taking is ibuprofen ? Usually in the morning . You know what you need ? And no allergies to any medications , as far as you know ? No . Which knee is it ? Right knee . - Right knee . - Right knee . I 've got this place on the Sound . It 's beautiful this time of year , and empty . You could come down and just stare at the water . Do you wear dentures , partial or full , - or have any dental implants ? - Is that a yes ? Hey . May I use your I.D. ? It 's all yours . At the Institute , we rely on the most advanced techniques that modern medicine has to offer to insure our patients ' comfort . What 's that ? It 's just some link I hit by accident , I guess . Guess who just assisted Bellows and McLeary . - Yeah ? - Mm-hmm . Great . Our business is caring ... caring for patients , caring for families , caring for the future . That 's what the Jefferson Institute is all about . Oh , Jefferson . Yeah . I 've just been kind of curious . Do you know about this place ? Uh , an uncle of mine got into a construction accident and landed in a coma . He ended up there a few years ago . My mom was ready to pull the plug , but they took him . - Wow . - I only visited once . It reminded me of a hotel . Or like a ... a giant funeral home . Is he still in there ? I 'm not even sure . The Jefferson Institute is one of only two facilities in the entire country that specializes in the care of patients in an advanced vegetative state . The institute can house these patients for a fraction of what it would cost a conventional hospital . Jefferson wouldn 't let us in , so we broke in . Room after room ... empty . What we did find , we can 't explain . Then the guards came . - They 're coming . - Go , go , go ! Can I help you ? Hi . I 'm a medical student at Memorial . I 'm wondering if I could have the tour . So sorry to have kept you waiting . We only conduct tours that have been arranged by hospitals or medical schools . Oh . I didn 't realize . - Mmm . - Um , well , since I 'm here , - there 's someone I 'd like to visit . - Family ? No , she 's a friend . Uh , Nancy Greenly ? Oh , my , no . Sorry . You would need permission from the patient 's life guardian . Well , she was someone I knew , and she came into the hospital . - I 'm a third-year med student . - Ah . I 'll speak to my advisor . Thank you , ma 'am . Oh , my God . I remember you . Susan , right ? Very funny . I 'm meeting Anna and Lizbeth at McCugh 's . You 're coming . No , I can 't . I 'm trying to study the coma rate at Memorial . You know , it 's nine cases in just a few months . You want one ? No . It 's different doctors , different procedures . It 's different times of day . And I lost access to the records . Why ? This nurse on the floor , Montoya ... she was helping me , and then she just quit . I don 't think she quit . A nurse on your floor stole a patient 's iPod . - Montoya ? - Yeah , I think so . They found it in her bag . Tell you what . I 'll get you the records if you do something in return . - How do you have access to records ? - They don 't care in Ophthalmology . They log in in the morning , and anyone can look at anything they want to . Okay , what do you want me to do ? Just give me a list of what you need , and either come hang out with me or ... Or what ? Or hang out with Dr. Bellows . He can help . You have his number , don 't you ? Ugh . Yes , he gave it to us , but ... If he gave it to you , then you can use it . He 's cute . Have dinner . Talk shop . See what else comes up . Yeah . Oh , no . You could turn that thing off when you 're here , you know . I 'm a doctor , remember ? How did she get your number ? She is entirely too young for me . Oh , he 's a politician . I 'm still jealous , though . " Baby , don 't be jealous . No , she means nothing to me . " This isn 't personal . I 'm sure she 's just calling about the Greenly case . That 's the procedure Dr. Taylor did - the day that he killed himself . - Oh . I tried to talk to him that day . Brushed me off . - You didn 't tell me you saw him . - Yeah . I know how much he meant to you . Survivor depression is very common in grieving families and friends , you know . " Was there something I could have done ? " " Was there one thing that I could have said ? " Dr. Nelson told me that Taylor 's health was failing . - Heart . - I didn 't know . And who knows what was going on with his family , with his wife , with his kids . - Yeah . - With his grandkids . Oh . Absolutely . I 'll see you there . - Mark ? - What are you doing ? - We got the surgery in ten minutes . - I know . Listen . I went to Jefferson , and for a place that houses only technically dead patients , they make it very difficult to get in . You don 't really have time for side projects . They said I would need you to arrange a tour for me . This is your surgical rotation . You really want to end up in Memorial or not ? I found eight other recent coma cases beside Nancy Greenly 's . - Well , it 's a big place . - In four months . That 's ten times higher than the average for the same number of surgeries . If that 's true , the hospital 's already looking into it . It 's not something they 're going to send a memo out about . Where did you get those numbers ? I looked at the transfers to Jefferson . I don 't know if it 's procedure or equipment or some particular doctor , but you have access to those surgical records . I mean , maybe ... How did you get access to the admittance - and the discharge files ? - Montoya . I think you may have helped get her fired . So , young man , which knee is it ? - It 's the right . - Susan ? Yeah . Hey . There you are . So , did you think about my offer ? Come down to the ocean , stare at the waves , wind in your hair ? Um , Sean , I think you know how I feel about those baby blues , so you do not want to make me jealous . Now , my fifth anniversary is tomorrow . - Should I get her perfume ? - Now , that 's original . Speaking of , is someone wearing perfume ? Oh , yeah , it 's ... it 's mine , Mark . Do you like it ? Never wear perfume in the O.R. , okay ? Might as well light a cigarette . - What is five ? - I know first is paper . - Wood , I think . - Right ? Five is wood ? So I can get her a pair of wooden clogs . That would make me sign on for another five years . I hear you . All right , heart rate is climbing . It 's over 100 . His heartbeat 's at 120 . Maybe we should have done the Nuerobloc . Turn the music off , please . Conner , can you keep this guy asleep for me , please ? I don 't think he 's breathing on his own . What 's going on ? Is he gonna be all right ? - You ... - BP is in the tank . 68 / 36 . Call my attending . Okay , what the hell 's going on here ? Get the crash cart , please . This can 't be happening . This guy 's totally healthy . Start compression . He 's arrested . - I 'm giving epi . - I can see that , damn it . Look , get a crash cart in here . Somebody call a code . - Hurry up . - Go , go , go . Call a code ! Come on , come on . Come on ! Seven , eight , nine , ten . Come on . - You should go home . - Get some sleep . What happened ? - You were there . - We did everything right . The hospital will review what happened to see if any mistakes were made , and why his body reacted the way that ... He had the same surgery two years ago . Same anesthesia , and he did not go into a coma - because of some reaction . - Susan , I 'm sorry . Hi . - I 'm Susan Wheeler . - Sure , Mark 's student . I 'm Ramirez . Have a seat . Um ... I ... I saw your name in Nancy Greenly 's file , and I was hoping you might tell me about what happened . Why ? I knew her . I was the one who took her hand from her fianc√© before we rolled her into the O.R. And I was the one who told him she wasn 't gonna wake up . What do you think ? Do you think she had a stroke ? And the procedure itself , was there anything unusual ? Was the ... was the ... her blood a lot darker ? Which would indicate a loss of oxygen to the brain ? No . If anything , it was brighter . Her color was fine . Her labs were fine , no problems with the surgery at all . What did the surgeon think about what happened ? Did you speak to him afterward ? The surgeon ? Dr. Taylor went home and hung himself . Did you drop this ? Hey ... you got these . I can 't believe you did it . Jen ? Jen , wake up . - Hey ... what 's going on ? - Hey . - I got those files you wanted . - I know . I saw . Thank you . Where 'd this come from ? What is it ? I don 't know . It was on the floor . Was somebody in here ? The landlord said he was gonna come by and fix the light over the sink . I heard what happened in surgery . Sorry . I got to go to bed . Mark Bellows , right ? Yeah , that 's me . James Harper . Yeah , I remember you . You 're ... you 're Regina Harper 's brother , right ? She 's finally dead . - Oh , God , I 'm sorry . - Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey ! - Is everything all right , Mr. B ? - Yeah . No , Lawrence . We 're okay . We just ... a little misunderstanding . - It 's fine . - Are you sure ? I 'm sure . Thank you , though . Thank you . At Jefferson , they ... they cremated her . Picked her ashes up this morning . My mother has Alzheimer 's . She doesn 't have much time left . The last thing she needs is your damn blood money . I want you to take this , and I want you to shove it up the asses of every nurse and doctor who was there that day . Going through old cases , Mark ? I believe it was my first rotation , - I heard it from you . - Heard what ? " A good doctor never stops looking for answers . " I never actually thought - you were listening . - I wasn 't . - The Harper case . - Yeah . - Find anything ? - No . I , uh ... I came to commend you on one of your students , Paul Carpin . He assisted Dr. Glaxon yesterday . I was in the room . Eager to learn , good hands , - very professional . - That 's fantastic . Thank you , sir . I 'll pass it on to him . He stands in contrast to another one of your students . You have explained the concept of patients ' rights - to privacy ? - Sir ... Searching for answers is one thing . Violating patients ' rights is another . Susan Wheeler , I 'm not sure you 've met . This is Dr. Nelson . He 's the head of anesthesiology . One of my interns , Dr. Ramirez , told me that you were questioning him ? Is there some level of expertise of which we are unaware ? I 'm sorry . I was only asking . I 'll be in touch with the university as to your conduct . Uh ... Dr. Nelson , in fairness , sir , I think she 's upset about the Berman case . Personally , this is the second case I 've been involved in that ended in an unexplained coma . You know very well that a hospital has a rigid chain of command . Leave the investigation to those who have the data . That 's their job . Susan Wheeler isn 't here to interrogate my doctors . She 's here to learn . That 's her job . - I understand , but , sir ... - Your name has come up as a candidate for the ethics committee . It means a lot more money , and you 'll have a chance to shape hospital policy . You 'll want to be a part of that . In a living subject , this would be coursing with dark and blue venous blood . First , we take the liver , and you can see the inferior vena cava ... Uh , Professor ? And , uh , if you nick it in surgery ... Don 't . What 's the matter ? Um , well , I had a pretty bad run-in with Dr. Nelson . He is investigating my conduct with the university . I think he wants to kick me out because I 've been digging around . Ah , look , look , he 's just an ass . And every year , he picks one student to pick on . Nothing ever comes of it . No , I 'm not talking about hospital politics here . People are being put into comas . They 're putting people into comas ? Do you know what your grandfather would be saying to you right now ? He would be saying that no doctor wants to lose a patient , and every doctor loses one . You have to promise yourself that you learn from it . I don 't understand . What are you saying ? I 'm saying for you to remember that you 're a doctor . You have a curious medical mind . Use it . Use it to alleviate the suffering of thousands of people to come . - Okay ? That 's ... - Excuse me , Professor Hillside . Yes . Yes , yes . And if Dr. Nelson keeps on you , let me know about it . Hey , this is Jen . You know what to do . Leave a message at the tone . Hey , Jen , it 's me . Uh , I just got off the train , so I 'll be home in a minute . What do you want to do ? Stop ! Don 't ! Get off of me . Get off of me ! Help ! You 'll end up in Jefferson , too . Look , I really don 't see the point of this . I told you , I didn 't see him . Maybe you saw him earlier in the evening , when he followed you . It might jar your memory . Look , truth is , Miss Wheeler , there 's not much else we can do . - The park is full of security cameras . - We checked the footage . He must 've gotten you in a blind spot . You do believe me ? Short of a witness coming forward , we don 't have anything to go on . Great . This is my second case . I assisted Taylor about a year ago . This girl , Regina Harper , she was a college track star , and it was a simple cyst removal , and she never regained consciousness . Neither of them make any sense to me . That 's one of the reasons we invented God ... to pin the blame for senseless occurrences on the whim of a higher power . I think Nelson dangled that job in front of me to shut Susan up ... which makes me wonder if there really is - a problem at Memorial . - The position wasn 't Nelson 's idea . - Oh , it was your idea ? - He 's just like everyone else ... open to the right suggestions . - What 's going on ? - I , uh ... I got to go . Susan . Susan , you all right ? Yeah . I 'm sorry to bother you . I really am . No . Please . My roommate didn 't pick up her phone , and ... I tried my friend Anna . I tried Geoffrey Fairweather . Well , hey , look , I 'm honored to be your last resort , okay ? Come on . - Let 's get you out of here . - Thanks . Did he hurt you ? It must have been really terrifying . I 'm so sorry . Did you get a look at him ? It was just a blur . I mean , he ... he came up behind me and covered my head ... threw me down on the ground , and he just ran off . I don 't even think they believed me in there . Then we should talk to somebody higher up . I mean , you were attacked . They 've got to do something , right ? This might sound crazy , but I think this guy was in my apartment . - What did the police say ? - I didn 't tell them that . They were already blowing me off . But ... Jen said ... she thought the super was in our apartment to fix this light , but that light is still broken . " You 'll end up in Jefferson , too . " What ... what does that mean ? That 's what he said in my ear when he was choking me . How come you didn 't tell me Nancy Greenly 's surgeon killed himself ? I know that it 's awful , but ... try not to make connections that aren 't there . Yeah , but what if it 's not a pathogen or some piece of equipment ? I mean , what if it 's intentional ? No , that doesn 't make any sense ... why would you intentionally put a patient into a coma ? Organs ? Organs ? Bioengineering ? Okay , let 's say you wanted a heart or a lung , or even a limb ... why not kill the patient during surgery ? Why even bother with a coma ? Death happens , and hospitals and families and judges accept that . But a coma , fairly or not , reeks of medical incompetence , and the lawyers come in . So ... I mean , can you honestly tell me you think you 'd make more money harvesting organs than you 'd pay out in litigation ? I mean , you 'd have to be doing something that brought in billions of dollars . See that house ? When I was a third-year med student , my father had a heart attack and died . Add to that the hours and the stress , and , uh ... I screwed up . I missed a fever in a patient , and ... by morning , she was full-blown septicemia . Dr. Taylor saved her and took me here . To his home , to have dinner with his family . Anyway , the reason I haven 't said anything , it 's not some conspiracy . I just ... It still hurts . - Sorry . - No , no . Don 't ... don 't be sorry . I honestly feel kind of silly , but ... Are you kidding ? I 'm not leaving until I know you 're okay . Is this your bedroom ? Where do you sleep ? Who sleeps ? - My roommate 's gone . - Is this her room ? Yeah . Boy ... I 'd say , when she leaves , she really leaves . Oh , my God . Hi , Mom . What ? No , I 'm fine . What do you mean ? No ... no , I 'm home . I 'm not in the hospital . Well , what did they say when they called ? No , no . No , no . Don 't come . I 'm fine . Really , I 'm ... I 'm home . This is a mistake . Okay . I love you , too . What happened ? Someone just called my mother and told her I was badly injured in a car accident . Who called ? They said they were from the E.R. at Memorial . - Hey . - Hmm ? I 'll see you later ? Yeah . Hey . What are you doing ? You can 't put a coffee cup on another human being . It 's disgusting . Come on . Vanya , it 's not worth it , dude . You owe me a cup of coffee , bitch . " Did you screw her ? " What , are we in high school ? I have a patient , Mark . I think we should talk about this . Let 's keep our professional and our personal lives separate . No , but there was a Kathleen Wheeler admitted ... Susan Wheeler . I 'm a medical student . It 's a big hospital . Somebody called my mom in New York from the E.R. last night . Let me ask my colleague . One moment . Let me see . Let me see . - Jesse ? Jesse , ¬ø qu√© pasa ? Jesse , ¬ø qu√© pasa ? Jesse ! Jesse ! Help ! He 's choking ! Help , please , I need a stretcher . Get that stretcher . He 's choking . We need to get him intubated . On three : one , two , three . Let 's open the door , please . No , no , it 's asthma . Look , we see him twice a month . - This is not asthma . - The mother won 't get rid of - the cats , the uncle smokes . Who are you ? - I 'm a medical student . - This is not asthma . - Oh , okay . Well , excuse me . Let me ... My brother has asthma . - It 's a different sound . Trust me . - Just hold on . All right , let me take a listen . Come here . Shh , shh , shh . All right , let 's get a tube in him . Excuse me , ma 'am . Let 's get her out of here . Marie , get the mother out of here . Ma 'am , please . He 's going to be fine . You 'll be more comfortable out here . Just calm down . - What can I do ? - Uh , tilt his head back . Hold him up like this . There you go . Very good . All right . Here we go . Ah ! There we go . There we go . All right . Hold him right there . Good . All right , this should be getting a good ... His O2 sat is dropping . I don 't think the tube is in place . Why don 't you just watch and learn ? On what ? What do we have here ? Dr. Stark , uh , it 's asthma . - I 've intubated ... - It 's not asthma . He 's not responding to the epinephrine . That 's not asthma . He 's choking . His carina 's blocked . Okay , bronchoscopy in the O.R. , right now . - Jesse ! - Oh , oh , oh . Uh , se√±ora , se√±ora . - S√≠ . - Okay ? There it is . And ... to the carina . And there 's where you were blocked . The air couldn 't get through the right main stem bronchus and into the lungs because there is ... a battery in the way . - A battery ? - A battery . Is Susan in there with Stark ? The man , the legend . Huh . Well , she is good ... I got to give her that . I hear she showed up Feldson in the E.R. Hey , why don 't you get a life ? Oh , yeah , I get it . Get me into a fight , get me voted off the island . Oh , you see right through me , Carpin . I 'm going to need some extra hands here . - You ever done this before ? - No , sir . Oh , it 's easy . Right here . Here we go . Ah , gentle , gentle . In we go . All right . You will grasp . One , two , three . Beautiful . Up we come . With me . Gently . Good . Well done , Doctor . Jen , hey . - Hey . - What 's going on ? I 've been trying to call you . Yeah , my phone died . Sorry . Sorry to just leave a note . My brother drove his truck up from Newnan . Last night was the only time he had . Oh . Here 's your key back . What 's going on ? They tossed me . What ? You know , it 's for the best . My grandma 's sick . This will give me more time to spend with her . They said I could probably come back next year . I 'm just here to sign some paperwork , dot the I 's , you know . I 'm sorry I skipped out on you . My head 's still spinning . What did they say ? They said my performance wasn 't up to par . Up to par ? There were no tests , no evaluations . Did they find out about the files that you printed out for me ? No . Why ? If they did , they didn 't say anything . I 'm so sorry . Excuse me . Hi . Come on in . Let 's get a coffee . Are you okay ? I just found Jen , and , uh , I think I may have gotten her thrown out of school . I found out something yesterday . Regina Harper ... the ... the coma patient . Yeah . Her family received a check for $ 485,000 . Do you think this is connected ? Hello , doctors . - Nice work . - Dr. Stark . You got a star there , Dr. Bellows . Uh , yes , this is Susan Wheeler . This is her first rotation . Pleasure to meet you under such circumstances . Sir , the honor is mine . You know , I took my first anatomy class from your grandfather . He was quite the taskmaster . He didn 't let much get by him , either . I was genuinely sorry to hear that he passed . Yeah , well , I was ... I was only 11 . You 're gonna do your family proud , but if you don 't , you 'll have me to answer to . - Sir . - It 's not you that I 'm worried about ; It 's Stark . I 'll talk to him . It 's just that he makes arbitrary decisions based on his God complex , and we have to live with them . I mean , I don 't know if you realize this , but he 's looking to scrap your study . He thinks his heart program is a big profit center . He 's already recruited Stafford . Maybe it 's time to replace him . Yeah , well , good luck with that . I mean ... he , uh , he 's the rainmaker . As long as he keeps bringing in funding , he 's not going anywhere . I want you to start taking this medication three times a day until we see each other again . That 's once every eight hours . Do you understand ? And let 's stay away from Ms. Wheeler for a while , okay ? Listen , I just came by to tell you that I spoke to Regina Harper 's brother . The coma patient , deceased , the one that I was ... Anyway , I went back into her file . There 's no diabetes , there 's no problems with previous surgeries , and there 's no sign of incompetence on Memorial 's part , yet she received some huge check from this brokerage firm . Now , the memo that I saw said Helix Global Care , Inc . What 's that ? I have no idea . I was hoping you could ... I mean , do they deal with the hospital ? Who knows ? Maybe it 's insurance . That would make sense ... pay fast , cut your losses . But why are you talking about this with me ? The mother has Alzheimer 's ... Margaret Harper . I didn 't know if you 'd seen her as a part of your study . I don 't have any patients named Harper , and you didn 't come here to talk about that . What did I come to talk about ? You came to dump me . We have something good , Mark . We could be a powerful couple at Memorial . I just think you need to think about it before you do something you 'll wish you hadn 't . I 've already done something I wish I hadn 't . Nice to see you 're capable of some emotion . Mark , don 't go . Yeah , I guess I just ruined my chances of getting on the ethics board , huh ? If there was a method that would bring an end to heart disease , lung disease or , say , Alzheimer 's , should we pursue it ? - Or course . - What if it involved testing on human subjects ? Uh , assuming we 're working within the law , I 'd say we 'd have to weigh the risks against the benefits . What if the tests were only done on deceased patients ? What is this about ? These are the types of questions the ethics board will be asking candidates . You have my back , I 'll have yours . It 's your career , Mark . Don 't let her derail you . Dr. Bellows . Dr. Nelson . Just about to look in on Lefferts . - Wheeler is done here . - Sir ? She accessed confidential patient files . I don 't care who her grandfather was . The friend is suspended , and Wheeler has to go , too . I 've already told administration , and I expect your support . Sir , I ... I ... You 're making me wonder , Bellows . Don 't . - Mark . - Julia , hi . I 'm so sorry I haven 't come by . I meant to , many times . I just ... haven 't . I was married to a doctor for over 40 years ; You don 't have to tell me . - Come on in . - It 's great to see you . Hey , Mark ! Hi . - Liza , hi . - How are you ? - Good to see you . - You , too . Hey , Donna , sweetie , time for a nap . - Hi , Donna . - Can you stay for lunch ? I wish I could . I got to get back to the hospital . - Okay . - Thank you , though . - Sleep tight , though . - Bye . Good to see you . They love him so much . It 's hard to imagine he 's not around anymore . I know . I saw him that morning , and I ... I didn 't know he was depressed . I would 've done something . I would 've said something . You know , just remember all the ... the lives that he saved , all the ... the lives he brought into the world . That 's what I 'm doing . Did he give you any indication as to - what he was struggling with ? - No . Did he leave a note or ... ? I only wish he had . Just doesn 't seem like him , you know , not leaving his house in order . He came home from work and went straight to his den . I know this is awkward , but do ... would you mind terribly if I look through his papers , his files ? You want to look through his papers ? Well , he didn 't bring his work home . Laptop ? Uh , his laptop ... he always left the laptop at his office . And I 'm sure that everything 's been cleared out by now . I 'm sure . He 's in God 's hands now . Susan Wheeler ? I 'm sorry . Can I help you ? Can you come with us , please ? Dr. Bellows . - Hey , good morning , guys . - Uh , good morning . I 'm a little embarrassed . Um , do you mind if we look inside your car ? - What do you mean ? Why ? - Well , we got a call . Now , it 's within your rights to refuse , but , uh , if you do , I have to tell them . I see . Is this a new policy for the entire staff or just me ? That 's what they pay me to do , sir . Yeah . Okay , sure , knock yourself out . Joe . Make sure you look carefully . Especially under the seats . That 's empty . You 're my witness . As assistant chief of staff , I 've called for an investigation into your conduct . Mr. Powers and Ms. Chen serve as counsel for the hospital . And Mr. Oren represents the corporation that owns Memorial . Susan , uh , you , uh ... you might not be familiar with my role at the hospital . I don 't meet many students . Uh , I 'm in charge of the day-to-day operations . That means I 'm responsible for the privacy and well-being of the patients and for the conduct of everyone employed at Memorial . I am a medical student . I 'm not employed by Memorial . If your actions result in the injury or death of a patient , Memorial will be named in the resulting lawsuit . Although you do not receive compensation , legally speaking , you are an employee . Now , the first thing I need you to do , Susan , is to take a look at this list . Now , these are verifiable instances where you attempted to circumvent the privacy policies of Memorial and used another employee 's I.D. To access computerized records of patients , as well as those accessed by another student , Jennifer Randle ... your roommate , I believe . Each of these patients was in a coma when they were discharged . - Right . - I was just trying to figure out why . I need you to sign this . Is security here to keep people out or to keep us in ? - Dr. Stark . - Thank you , gentlemen . Thank you . This is a disciplinary - hearing , Dr. Stark . - Memorial has a problem . Wheeler here has identified it . She should be given a pat on the back . Well , then , I 'll tell you what . You can give the deposition when something this girl does gets the hospital sued . This really doesn 't concern you , Doctor . I 'm chief of staff , Phil . Everything concerns me . There are people we all answer to , even the chief of staff . I wouldn 't want this to come back and bite you . Don 't let Phil get to you . He 's got a wife , three kids and a mother he loves . He 's not really a jackass . It 's just part of his job description . I will bring this up with the board . Not just the Memorial staff . The entire board . I believe in Susan , and I will personally guarantee her future conduct . All right , very well . You seem to have made a powerful friend . Hold on to him . - I have something to show you . - Oh . This will be the Memorial Children 's Health Complex . In a financial climate where other hospitals are going under left and right , we are expanding . You know why , Susan ? People who care , people like yourself , will be the foundation upon which this future will be built . So , let 's talk about these coma statistics . We became aware of this issue a year ago , and a panel was created to study it . What troubles me is that some of the panel ... Dr. Nelson , for example ... might be inclined just to cover their asses , and others may actually try to suppress the truth because it does expose certain incompetence or carelessness on their part . You are a fresh pair of eyes . You 're not involved in the sordid politics of this place , and so I would be really curious to see what you might come up with if you were to ... dig around a little bit . One caveat , one requirement , is that you bring anything you find directly to me and only me . Well , Mark ... Dr. Bellows ... has also been very helpful ... Susan , only me . I know it sounds paranoid , but he 's close to Dr. Lindquist , she 's close to Dr. Nelson ... You get the picture . Don 't trust anyone . Anyone ? Almost anyone . What ? Well , I feel like there might be some answers at the Jefferson Institute , and I can 't even get in there . Now you can . Thank you . Hoping to take over Dr. Taylor 's office ? Dr. Nelson . No , I 'm just , uh ... I 'm looking for something . What ? - Dr. Taylor 's laptop , actually . - Probably at the house . No , no . Julia said it was here . " Julia . " And , um ... what do you want with it ? Nothing . She just ... she asked that I find it . Well , I can assure you the office has been thoroughly cleaned out . Yeah , yeah , it sure looks that way . Okay , well , it was worth a shot . Uh , so you know , I tried to have Susan Wheeler dismissed from Memorial . I heard that . How did that work out for you ? Well , loyalty to the family legacy seems to have superseded common sense . Thanks . I think you struck a nerve . There 's a lot more going on around here than we think . Why ? I just found pills in my car . Pills ? What pills ? Oxycontin . At least 200 of them . Somebody 's trying to set me up . I heard Stark came to your rescue . Yeah . He promised to get me access at Jefferson . Are you sure you can trust him ? That 's what he said about you . Excuse me . Are you with the tour ? Yeah , I have an appointment . Well , come around that way . I 'll take you there . Identification ? You like my babies ? Um ... yeah , they 're beautiful . This one 's Chinese , and this one 's mulatto . But still , they 'll always be my babies . You 're not with the Helix Global Care group . The ... uh , no . Dr. Stark arranged a tour . Ah . Oh , yes . Now , just stay with the tour . No use of cell phones . - And no photography , please . - Yes , ma 'am . Updated with the most modern technology . This will be a demonstration that only our professional visitors get to see . Barry , bring 143 up to Visiting Suite Six . Families need to feel like their loved ones are in a friendly , soothing environment . Visits must be arranged in advance , and we try and schedule the same room to establish a sense of continuity . We can transfer patients to any one of our ten visiting suites . Our breakthrough technology allows families to see loved ones in a comforting setting , while eliminating bedding and associated costs for the Institute . Remember , our families are completely unaware of this technology , and it 's only one of the many improvements we 've made in the field of long-term care . And now for our control room . From this room , we can monitor any patient 's vitals . It 's also where we control the transfer of patients to and from the visiting suites . And I remind you again , no pictures , please . Barry , will you return 143 from Visiting Suite Six to Area One ? - Roger that . - Thank you . And now , if you 'll join me for some refreshments , and then we 'll have a short presentation . ... Jesus . Holy Mary , Mother of God , pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death . Amen . Hail , Mary , full of grace , the Lord is with thee . Blessed art thou among women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb , Jesus . Amen . Gentlemen . A young medical student has wandered off the tour . She 's in Corridor B. Pressure on the floor in Area One . All security report . We 're on it . Come on , people , it 's one tiny little girl . End the tour . Just get them all out of here . This is where our tour ends . You are entering a sterile area . Stay where you are . Security is on its way . No ! Let me go ! Let me go !

 ( water bubbling ) ( suspenseful music plays ) ( people shriek ) ( cell phone chimes ) - You 're texting again ? - Huh ? Come on , put that down and swim with me . In the ocean ? There 's fish out there . - Your loss . - ( chimes ) ( chimes ) Oh my God . Bree ! Bree ! Shark ! Bree , there 's a shark ! ( shrieking ) Oh my God ! Somebody help her , please ! There 's a shark ! Bree , shark ! Oh my God . ( bellows ) ( creature calling ) ( pings ) Oh my God . Are you okay ? - Are you okay ? - What just happened ? - There was a shark . - Oh my God . - ( elevator bell dings ) - ( keyboard cIacking ) Welcome to Blue Water . This better be good , Sands . I stood up an admiral to be here . Trust me , Commander . You 're gonna wanna see this . What are we looking at here ? S-1 1 's been fitted with cameras . We received these images 10 minutes ago . My God . Very " National Geographic , " isn 't it ? - Freeze it . - ( beeps ) See ? The girl got away . Why didn 't S-1 1 go after her ? Because we jerked its leash . We told it to behave . - Come again ? - Like a shark- - let me let my daughter explain . Like a shark , S-1 1 can sense electrical impulses , helping it navigate . We manipulate this ability by transmitting focused electrical charges to a series of receptors implanted in S-1 1 's cerebral cortex . I have no idea what she just said . S-1 1 is now totally under our control . Blue Water Corp. has just created the Navy 's next superweapon . Sands , you crafty SOB . You did it . Was there any doubt ? Baby girl , bring S-1 1 home . - ( beeps ) - ( S-1 1 bellows ) Sir , we 've got S-1 1 on an intercept path of a fast moving vessel . Change course . No , take it in closer . Commander , the swimmer was a chance encounter . S-1 1 still needs more testing . I procured millions of dollars of taxpayer money to develop that thing . Before Blue Water gets one more cent , I better see it perform . But the external interface is a prototype . If something were to happen- - What did you have in mind , Commander ? S-1 1 was designed to go where the Navy can 't , right ? Sneak into hostile waters , hunt down drug runners and pirate vessels . So you want us to treat that craft like the enemy ? Move in tight and pursue without being seen . - Dad ? - Make me proud , pumpkin . I told you to stop calling me that . Make me proud , Nicole . ( pats ) ( beeping ) - lsn 't this fun ? - Yeah , man . - ( laughs ) - ( shouts ) Hold on ! ( beeps ) You can breathe now . - ( thuds ) - ( moans ) Whoa . What was that ? You hit something ? Whoa ! ( alarm beeping ) What 's going on ? - S-1 1 isn 't responding to command . - ( keyboard cIacking ) The propeller must 've damaged the external interface . I told you it wasn 't ready for adverse conditions . Get the system back online now . It 's not working . I 'm engaging the kill switch . - ( high-pitched whine ) - In three ... two ... - one . - lt 's too late , Nicole . Look . - ( alarm blaring ) - Woman : We 've lost our signal . - Oh my God . - What just happened ? S-1 1 escaped . ( groans ) So you ever see anybody fall off one of these things ? Fall ? Nah . I seen a guy jump once , though . Wife left him so he took a nosedive from 60 floors up . - That 's horrible . - Ain 't so bad . Close your eyes . Close your eyes . Feel the wind in your hair . - ( sighs ) - splat ! ( laughs ) lt 's all over with . I can think of worse ways to go anyhow . Like what ? Like falling face first in a French fryer . - ( mimics sizzling ) - Thanks . I 'll have that image in my head all day . Huh ? ( groans ) How about getting jammed into a wood chipper ? Whoa ! Oh no ! Not like this ! ( screaming ) - ( man grunting ) - ( S-1 1 bellows ) Signals from the tracking implant are fading , but it looks like S-1 1 's heading south . Commander . You just unleashed an eight-legged man-eating shark on the world . A minor setback . If you 're thinking of going back into that lab and creating a new freak , forget it . I 'm cutting off all Blue Water funding until you get S-1 1 back . Fail , and that 's not all I 'll cut off . Relax , Commander . We 'll get S-1 1 , even if we have to go to the ends of the earth . Okay , telemetry shows he 's heading to Mexico . Let 's get a team down there now . ( birds coo ) Any changes ? Hard to say . The tracking implant was damaged when S-1 1 ripped off its control plate . But we 're still receiving ghost signals indicating S-1 1 's presence in the coastal waters . Can we pinpoint its location ? Not exactly , Dr. Sands . But S-1 1 is here , and for some reason , it 's sticking around . Migratory instincts . It 'II feed along the coast a few days and then move on . - This is us , sir . - We 're here ? I chartered a smaller craft too for the recovery mission . A fast one , I hope . - lt will do the job , sir . - Good . Sir , I think we should also contact Andy Flynn . Flynn ? He 's here in Mexico ? Since you let him go two years ago . I didn 't let him go , Santos . I fired his ass 'cause he demanded a raise- - a big one . He 's a greedy bastard , no doubt , but he knows these waters better than anyone . And he knows what we 're up against . If you want S-1 1 back , Andy Flynn is your best shot . ( groans ) All right , find him . ( women speaking Spanish ) Who 's ready for some tequila ball ? - Ready , gringo ? - Whoo ! You missed . Let 's go , ladies . ( woman speaking Spanish ) - There you go . - Gracias . Andy Flynn . Still drinking that rotgut , huh ? Santos . What 's up , brother ? What are you doing here ? Looking for you . No , you didn 't . - Blue Water wants you back . - Not a chance , man . Not a chance . - If it 's about the money- - - Look , it 's always about the money . AII right ? That idiot Sands , he won 't pay me what I 'm worth , so I 'm retired . - Not anymore , amigo . - ( sighs ) S-1 1 escaped . ( metal detector beeping ) ( metal detector whines ) ( screaming ) Please help me ! Please ! No ! Please ! Please ! ( screams ) No , don 't ! No no no no no no ! No ! No ! ( S-1 1 bellows ) Hey , guys . So glad you could join us , Mr. Flynn . - Do we have a location ? - Sands : No . But like an octopus , he 's very territorial . It won 't stray far . You understand you are to capture S-1 1 , not terminate it , right ? Well , your fish might have other ideas . S-1 1 can be controlled , Mr. Flynn . Let me show you . We call these interface darts . Once attached , I can access S-1 1 's bioimplants with my computer allowing me to direct its movements . Like a remote control toy . Sounds easy . It won 't be easy , believe me . First , we have to tranquilize S-1 1 . That 'll make him docile . And then he won 't resist commands . The tranqs will bring S-1 1 to the surface , and then we can hit it with the interface dart . Why don 't we just nail it underwater with your dart ? They 're more accurate if shot from a grenade launcher . And since we only have two darts , accuracy is key . Once I establish a link , I can then navigate S-1 1 to open waters . Then our techs on the yacht will be able to fix the interface . So what do you say ? Are you game ? Yeah . 100 grand , 200 more upon completion , why not ? You think a great deal of yourself , don 't you , FIynn ? Yeah , you know what I think ? I think you 're a money-grubbing Neanderthal . And the word on you is you like cheap women and cheaper booze . is that right ? 300 grand or I go back to the pool . Fine , 300 grand . But only if you bring S-1 1 back alive . Otherwise you get nothing . This is a bad idea , Sands . We should just 86 that freak before it takes any more lives . That freak represents a giant leap in genetic engineering . Damage it and heads will roll , Mr. FIynn . Yours will be first . Fine . Get your stuff ready . We 're going to the boat . Santos and I will meet you at the dock . Dónde está señor Kingsberry ? ( sighs ) Ay ay ay . Classy . You Kingsberry ? Well , the locals call me Pez . What can I do for you , angel ? First , Pez , you can stop staring at my rack . They 're just boobs . They 're not gonna get up and dance or anything . Second ... you can tell me about this . How 'd you find me ? It 's what I do . I 'm Stacy Everheart , an investigative reporter with CNE . - And this is my cameraman Bones . - Hey , buddy . ( sighs ) You sent that to our station two days ago . It was a joke . - A joke . - That 's right . - Oh , we like jokes . - Sorry to waste your time . You 're lying . A creature fitting this description was sighted just last week in California . Now it 's in vallarta and you 've seen it . Well , I wish to the devil I hadn 't . I can 't close my eyes without imagining that- - that thing squirming towards me . It 's gotten so bad I can 't take my boat out . No , I 'm done with that thing . There 's nothing you can- - What do you wanna know ? All right , Pez . Can we stop ? Come on . We gotta burn off those enchiladas from last night . But we 're on vacation , and it 's Mexico . I think it 's against the law to jog in Mexico . Fine . You 're gonna have to save your breath anyway . You 'll be screaming your lungs out soon . Wait . Why ? Two words- - bungee jumping . I found a great spot over the ocean . So not funny . You know I 'm afraid of heights . Gonna have to get over that sooner or later . Today 's the day . All right , tell you what . Do this and spend the rest of the day at the spa . Mud-baths ? Seaweed wraps ? - Sure . - Okay , you 're on . ( birds squawking ) - ( laughs ) - ( screaming ) All right ! Yes ! Great . - Nice . - Whoo ! ( laughing ) Man : Yes ! Nice . Babe , that was awesome . I can 't believe I did it . Who 's afraid of heights now , huh ? Not my girl . - Wait , I wanna go again . - wild child . Vendor : Listo . Vamos ! ( screaming ) Whoo ! ( laughing ) ( boat horn blows ) It 's gonna be like old times , Santos . - Yep . - lt 's gonna be like old times . She 's got a sexy-librarian vibe going . - You ever notice that ? - Don 't even think it , bro . Oh , what ? I 'm just gonna talk to her . I 've heard that before . Remember Cairo ? The lady snake-charmer with cobras ? - Cairo , come on . - My left butt cheek went black , Flynn . - almost fell off . - So you miss me ? Excuse me ? You might 've noticed I took a little hiatus from Blue Water . By hiatus , you mean my father fired you . Yeah . I did notice , Mr. Flynn . Look , call me Andy . ( sighs ) All right . Let 's just get this over with so I can get back to work . Give me your best line . Okay . Um , here . - What ? - Souvenir from Baghdad- - piece of shrapnel from an IED . Went in back here , played ping-pong with my insides . If it weren 't for Santos over there , I probably wouldn 't have made it . So I have him to blame . Look , I remember you too , Nicole , all right ? You spent your whole life in that lab . First one there , last one to leave . And I get it . That was me once . AII right ? My whole life was work . Thanks to this little guy , it looked like there was no tomorrow . So that 's my line . What do you think ? Being first in the lab earned me a doctorate from mit and made me one of the best biomechanical engineers in the country . I care about what I do , Mr. Flynn . As for you , you 're a mercenary . Says it all . Hmm . Okay . As smooth as ever , huh ? - Oh , shut up . - ( laughs ) ( dance music playing ) Okay , if that didn 't get your booty shaking , have somebody check your pulse , 'cause you might be dead . I 'm Captain Jack and this is PV Pirate Radio , your spring break destination . Just in case they 're listening , I wanted to give a special shout out to the FCC , 'cause those are the boys who kicked my ass out of America . And , boys , you have doomed me to a life filled with sandy beautiful beaches , smoking hot señoritas and ice cold piña coladas . - You sure taught me a lesson . - ( both laugh ) Folks , I may never leave here . God , I hate it here . You 're kidding me , right ? I mean , this place is amazing . Yeah , whatever . And what is it with all this- - what do you call it ? - Sunshine ? - Yes . Sunshine . Enough with the freaking sun already . - It 's annoying . - ( phone chimes ) What do you got here ? tell you in a sec . You are live in five . Four , three , two ... Hey , party people , it 's Captain Jack and you are listening to PV Pirate Radio . First mate Stephie has just handed me some breaking news . Apparently a half shark , half octopus has been sighted off the coast two miles south of Playa Del Sol . According to sources , it is armed and dangerous . Yes , it 's half octopus , so it would be eight-armed and dangerous , right ? Well , Stephanie apparently is hitting the tequila a little early today and she 's not sharing with her captain . - ( clicks ) - l always share with you . Yeah . So what is this , Stephie ? is this some mad experiment gone horribly wrong ? - Maybe they 're doing a movie . - Oh , yeah. I could see that now . A former Navy SEAL slash oceanographer is tracking down this abomination before it takes any more lives . I 'd watch it . Yeah , I know you would , Stephanie . That 's because you 're easily amused . I 've seen you mesmerized watching a frozen burrito rotate in a microwave oven . Let 's get back to the music , shall we ? Coming up next , it 's the Cheetah Whores , very hot band out of New York City . Here is their latest hit . It 's called " Hot Rod Hell Kitten . " Meow . - ( rock music playing ) - What are you doing with this stuff ? ♪ I 'm a hot rod hell kitten , get inside ♪ ♪ I 'm a hot rod hell kitten , take a ride ♪ ♪ ltty-bitty pretty kitty ♪ ♪ Let 's go out and prowl the city ♪ ♪ Do you wanna be my pet ? ♪ ♪ Do you wanna be my pet ? ♪ ♪ I 'm a cheetah whore , can you run with that ? ♪ ♪ Yeah ! Yeah ! ♪ Well , this is it . - Nice view , huh ? - Yeah yeah , breathtaking . - Hey ! - There . Thank you . - Hook me up ? - Not a chance . Aw , you 're no fun . So what makes you think it 'II come back here ? well , when you spend your days gutting fish , you learn a thing or two about marine life . - ( spits ) - Hard to believe you 're still single . Would 've thought some lucky lady would 've snapped you up by now . As I was saying , octopi are very territorial . He 'll be back . Nicole : Santos , take it 20 miles south and stop by the rocks . Let me see that thing . Easy , bro . Those spears inject enough MS-222 to put a bull shark to sleep . But it can 't bring down S-1 1 ? Nicole : S-1 1 's metabolism is higher than a typical shark . Tranqs just make it more ... amenable . - Kind of like you and tequila , huh ? - ( laughs ) - ( sonar pinging ) - I got a signal . - lt 's two miles south of here . - Yeah , I know the place . Resorts all over the area . ( dials cell phone ) ( rings ) - Dad . - Yes , Nicole . - We got a signal . - l don 't have to tell you what 's at stake here , pumpkin . I told you to stop calling me that . I 'm counting on you , Nicole . Bring S-1 1 home . Okay , Stacy , in three , two ... Stacy Everheart here with local fisherman Ryan Kingsberry . It 's Pez . All right , Pez . Can you tell us what you saw ? Well , I first saw the creature coming in from out there chasing a charter . I thought it was a shark at first , and then I saw the tentacles and black soulless eyes like my third wife 's . Cut . What are you doing ? Are you high orjust that stupid ? Holy crap ! ( bellowing ) Hey ! Hey ! Get out of there ! Yoga instructor : Inhale . Get out of there ! Inhale . Exhale . Break left . Hola , señorita . You wanna play ? Not really . Hey , what 's the holdup ? Got it ! ( grunting ) Mark ! ( crunches ) ( roars ) ( people screaming ) - Are you getting this ? - Yes. yes . ( screams ) - ( S-1 1 roaring ) - ( screaming ) ( shrieks ) Pez : Get out of there ! ( screams ) - Is it over yet ? - Um , not quite . ( gasping ) Pez : Oh , this ain 't happening . ( panting ) That was horrible . Sure . Sure . Horrible . Come on , let 's go . ( sonar pings ) Damn it ! Lost the signal . - What ? - l lost the signal . S-1 1 's gone . Damn it ! You sure that thing works ? I told you the tracer got damaged when S-1 1 escaped . Great . So we 're chasing ghosts out here . I don 't think so . We sure our freak did that ? The abrasions on his body are tentacle markings . Why didn 't it eat him ? Maybe he wasn 't hungry . Oh , keen insight . I 'm so glad you came along . tell me something , Ms. Sands , what do you know ? I know octopi like big rocks . - Sir . - What is it ? There 's something on TV I think you should see . Stacy : My crew and I captured this footage an hour ago around Playa Del Sol ... So far only CNE is carrying this . And that 's supposed to make me feel any better ? Stacy : The creature appeared to be some hybrid of shark and octopus . - A sharktopus , if you will . - Hell . Stacy : As viewers can see , the creature is like nothing ever witnessed before , and neither is its brutality . There 's no confirmation by authorities yet , but fatalities are certain . Dr. Sands , you 've got an incoming call on satellite link . - Stacy : It 's only a matter of time ... - It 's Commander Cox . ... before the sharktopus strikes again . - All right , patch him in . - Stacy Everheart reporting . Wait . First bring me a great , big , enormous scotch . - Three and neat , sir ? - Yeah . Got it . What 's going on ? Why did we come ashore ? To get away from your dad 's eagle Scouts so you can tell me what the hell you 're hiding . - What are you talking about ? - S-1 1 's killing at random . Why ? I told you , I have no idea . Look , even I know sharks aren 't serial killers , okay ? They kill for a purpose . And octopi ? ( scoffs ) Smart as hell , and not to mention stealthy . Okay , so they 're not gonna expose themselves unless they got a damn good reason not to . Maybe our neural implants are damaging the impulse controls in S-1 1 's brain . Or maybe your father did something to that freak , something you don 't know about . You know , a little gene splicing behind closed doors ? No , he wouldn 't do that , not without consulting me first . My father is a man of science . How about you tell that to the dead guy out there ? What 's that supposed to mean ? It means that I think your dad intended S-1 1 to succeed at all costs . Blue Water didn 't hire you to think . They hired you to do a job . And if you can 't do it , we 'll find someone who can . ( sighs ) Get Tom on the phone . Look , I don 't care if he 's in a meeting . Tell him Stacy Everheart wants to talk to him now . - Thank you . - ( TV playing ) Yep , I 'm watching the recap right now . So what 'd the network say ? Tom : The network is replacing you , Stacy . - What ? - l 'm sorry . - That 's the decision they 've made . - But it 's my story . - Hey , Stacy- - - l hope you understand , all right ? No , I understand . - Fine . - ( beeps ) Rat bastards are sending in another reporter to take the lead . - What ? - What is this ? Pez figured out a pattern in the attacks . Show me . This is where l first spotted the creature . This was the attack on the bungee tower . And this was the attack on the resort . So it 's sticking to the coast heading south . - Yeah . - What are we supposed to do ? Just head south and hope we run into it ? Worth a shot , and maybe we can get some more footage . Then the network would have to make us the leads . You know , I bet we could cover a lot more miles by boat . Fine . But you 're gonna double my salary and you 're gonna pay for my car . Oh , Pez , I could just hug you right now . I mean , if you were better looking and had better hygiene . Oh , what the hell ! - Pez ! - l 'm sorry . Lock and load , boys . It 's time to get wet . You got the helm , brother . You better watch your back down there . Oh , watching my back is yourjob . - l don 't know . Am I in your will ? - You get my dog . You don 't have a dog . ( laughs ) Hey . Remember , my dad doesn 't want S-1 1 harmed , all right ? And we always do what Daddy says , don 't we ? relax , I 've got 300,000 reasons to bring that thing back in one piece . We stick to the plan , tranq it , force it to the surface , then Santos shoots it with your remote control gizmo , and you guys jockey it back to your yacht , if your gear really works . Yeah , it does work . So make sure you don 't miss . I haven 't yet . Now I 'm ready . Patch him in . Guess what I just saw on CNE . S-1 1 looks impressive on TV , doesn 't it , Commander ? Are you drinking ? Yes , I am . Scotch . - Good scotch . - Damn it , Sands . You said you could handle this . - Listen , if you can 't handIe- - - No , Commander , you listen . The Navy said they wanted a killing machine . That 's exactly what I gave them . And yes , the civilian deaths are a tragedy . But greatness comes at a price . It always has . Just capture that freak before it shows up on TV again . If the media links this to the Navy , we 're screwed . Don 't worry , Commander . I 've got my best man on it . Don 't worry . Flynn can take care of himself . Worried ? Why would I be worried ? - No reason . - Hey , do me a favor . Stay out of my business and focus on the shooting . - AII right ? - Yes , ma 'am . ( growling ) What is that ? - lnk . - Oh God , no . ( bellows ) - ( thuds ) - ( gurgling ) Santos . It 's right behind me . It got me in the leg . Did your tranq hit it ? No . It pulled it out of its hide . - What about the others ? - They 're gone . They 're dead . So what makes you think we 'll spot it out here ? I don 't know , but if you 've got a better idea , I 'm all ears . No no , you 're the captain . Nice yacht , by the way . Bite me . ( groans ) Flynn : What do you think ? Two or three stitches ? Santos : This is nothing . Remember that go-go dancer in Bangkok ? Crazy chica nearly bit your pinkie toe off . Now that was bad . Man , I have no idea where that thing came from . - lt 's like it knew we were coming . - That 's what sharks do , amigo . No , this wasn 't predatory instinct . This was a planned attack . - ls that mine ? - Damn it . You better not have any diseases . Yeah , well , it burns when I urinate . - Shouldn 't be concerned , should I ? - ( cell phone rings ) - Oh , there 's Daddy . - Dad . Yeah , it escaped and the tracer went dead again . is that your dad ? Tell him I miss him . is that Flynn ? Yeah , he 's still in shock from the blood loss . - Can he continue the mission ? - He 'll be fine . But the others , they weren 't so lucky . They knew the risks , Nicole . Dad , S-1 1 is a killer , and they 're random . It 's not even feeding on its victims . Dad ? I had the tech boys make some adjustments to S-1 1 's subroutines . You altered my programming ? S-1 1 was a hunter . We needed a killer . So we enhanced its aggressiveness . I designed the bioware . I should 've been consulted . This isn 't right . It 's time for you to grow up , baby girl . Our feelings are irrelevant . Right now all that matters is getting S-1 1 back . Am I clear ? Are you with me ? - Yes . - Good . Now bring S-1 1 home , baby girl . Did he ask about me ? - Can you move on that thing ? - Why ? Wanna go dancing later ? Do you always make asinine jokes when men have died ? Look , what do you want from me ? I want you to do your damn job and capture S-1 1 . Okay . You heard the woman , fire it up . - Where are we headed ? - South . ( motor revving ) nicole : He 's headed straight for that boat . Flynn : I 'm pulling up behind them to get their attention . We gotta get them out of here . Hey ! - Leave ! - Hey , this is a restricted area ! Can you hear them ? I can 't hear what they 're saying . This is restricted area . Bones , get on the clock . Something 's going on . Please go ! They 're not listening . They 'll listen to this . - ( gunfire ) - ( gasps ) Keep filming . - What are you doing ? - l didn 't sign up to get shot . That 's my story you 're running away from . I 'm getting the hell out of here . Hey ! You crazy bitch ! ( screams ) Oh my God ! ( panting ) Your dad 's gonna have to settle for damaged goods . ( screaming ) ( S-1 1 roars ) It 's heading away from the rocks . I 'm gonna run that bastard down . Santos , take the helm . - l 'm gonna take a shot at it . - Got it . - Santos . - l 'm on it . ( fires ) Damn ! How about that one ? All right , man . Perfect . To the boat and back . Loser gets the tequila . Let 's do it . What are these morons doing ? Hey , you 're a little close , huh ? - ( whistles , laughs ) - What are you doing ? What is this , an amusement park to you ? - Hey ! - l 'm trying to fish here . - ( laughing ) - Hey ! Hey , Maria . I can 't believe this . What 's going on , honey ? Bunch of stupid punks . ( engine sputtering ) ( screaming ) ( clamoring ) Dios mío . Tequila 's on you guys , and I 'm super thirsty . Where 's Bob ? I don 't know . He was just right behind you . Hey , something just touched my leg . What was that ? ( screaming ) Ed . Ed ! Ed ! Ed ! ( screams ) ( crunching ) I 've been horrible to you this whole time . And you don 't deserve it . I 'm sorry , Flynn . It 's Andy . Andy , there 's something I need to tell you . ( man speaking Spanish ) Got it . Gracias , Miguel . What ? Nothing . What 'd you find out ? The powerboat was rented by some Blue Water Corporation , some shady genetics engineering firm , knee-deep in defense department contracts , enough cash to go all Frankenstein and create our fish . That 's great . What is wrong with you ? Were you a lawyer in a past life ? Or no , maybe you worked at the DMV . Do you feel nothing , Stacy ? That guy was killed right in front of us inches away . inches away ! Gosh . He was kind of a nice guy , you know ? Smell a little funky , but he was okay . Now he 's dead . And that 's tragic truly . But the story of a lifetime is right out that door . And we can find it thanks to Pez 's map . - No no . - Oh , come on , Bones . He would 've wanted it this way . Don 't let his death mean nothing . You are so full of crap . I know , but you 're coming with me anyway . Hell not ! Your father did what ? Altered S-1 1 's neural implants , disrupting serotonin levels . Making it more aggressive . That explains all the random attacks . You know what I gave up to be my dad 's perfect little scientist ? Now he goes and does this behind my back . Look , I 'm sorry , Nicole . What can I say ? He 's my dad. I love him . - ( sonar pinging ) - Santos : flynn . It 's the tracking device on my computer . S-1 1 's near . Do you mind telling us the plan ? We 've been one step behind that freak all day . Time to cut it off . ( rock music playing ) ( cell phone beeps ) You aren 't gonna believe this . What ? You 're finally ready to admit you 're attracted to me ? Thank God . The sexual tension was unbearable . Ew ! Gross . God . - You ? - All right , easy . A simple no would 've sufficed . The captain has feelings , you know ? All right , Jack , there has been another sighting of this creature . And now supposedly CNE is running footage of it . Really ? Wow . - How gullible do you think I am ? - Look , this isn 't a joke , I swear . Just , please , warn the audience . - Okay , I 'll warn them . - ( music turns off ) Attention all hands . This is your captain speaking . We 're getting more reports about this half shark , half octopus creature that 's terrorizing the coast , but please do not panic . There is a way we can stop this thing . Virgin sacrifices . Yes , the Mexican Fish and Game Commission assures me the only way to appease this beast is to offer it a beautiful virgin , preferably 18 to 25 years old . I repeat- - sharktopus wants our virgins . So all prospective candidates , please email your photos , preferably nudes , I wish there was another way . I 'm sorry . This is our only hope . Damn you , sharktopus ! ( laughs ) ( music turns on ) Oh , what ? Don 't look at me like that . Oh ! How can you live with yourself ? - You 're not punking me on this thing ? - No . Stephie , this has to be a hoax , okay ? It 's gotta be . There 's no way a shark-octopus fishy thingy really exists . - Well , I hope you 're right . - Trust me , okay ? There is no such thing as a sharktopus . ( screaming ) - ( thuds ) - Gotta love these Mexican roads . Where are we ? Please , just keep your eyes on the road . Shame on you if you kill us before sharktopus does . Honey , why don 't we go back to the resort ? Not until I hook a fish . You still worried about that shark we saw ? It wasn 't a shark . Look , babe , relax . It 's a big ocean . No matter what it was , we 're not gonna see it again . ( water splashes ) ( whistles ) What are we doing here ? - We 're two miles off the last signal . - Check your map . You 'll notice the distance between S-1 1 's attacks are nearly equal . How did you figure this out ? Back at Los Arcos I wasn 't sure . And now you are ? Nope , but I 'm sick and tired of chasing the freak around all day . So if I 'm right , it 'll come to us . You 're in no condition for diving . Wasn 't planning on it . We can lure S-1 1 to the surface without using the tranqs . And how do we do that ? - Ugh ! - What ? You 've never seen five gallons of fish guts before ? - ( reel clicking ) - Whoa ! Come here . Good ! Did you get a fish ? Come on . ( grunting ) Come on ! Come on . Come on . Come on . ( laughs ) Got you . I can 't believe you bought that . - Estúpido . - Oh , estúpido ? How about now ? - How about now , honey ? - No . No . How about now , honey ? Huh ? Huh ? How about now ? ( screaming ) Kevin ! Kevin , where are you ? Kevin ! Kevin ! Kevin , where are you ? Kevin !

Andy 's right . S-1 1 needs to be put down . - You don 't know what you 're saying . - S-1 1 's a crime against nature . - We went too far . - lt can be controlled , baby . You know that . At what price ? How many more lives are you gonna sacrifice ? What about my life ? Oh , baby . S-1 1 is my creation . Mine . I dedicated my entire life to it . I will not allow anyone to destroy it .

We should call it quits for today . We call it quits when I say we call it quits . Hey , it 's the guy from the speedboat . The one following the sharktopus . Come on . The river narrows a few miles south , so we just need to get a pair of wheels . All right . I 'm Stacy Everheart with CNE . Can you tell me what you 're doing here ? Get out of my face , lady . What connection do you have to the creature known as the sharktopus ? Are you employed by the Blue Water Corporation ? You got a car ? - Yeah . - Gimme the keys . You 're going after that thing , aren 't you ? Take me with you , and you can use my van . - No . - Then have fun walking . ( thudding ) Gotta love Mexican roads , huh ? What are you planning ?

( people screaming ) ( screaming ) Looks like we 're late to the party . Great , I 've got no bullets left and we 're out of grenades . - You could use this . - Nicole , we 're past that . Wait . Hear me out . S-1 1 has a kill switch- - explosives laced into its neural implants . But the switch became inoperable when S-1 1 's bioware was damaged . Then what good is it ? My dad- - l think he was trying to tell me something . I think I can access the kill switch with my computer . - Bones . Bones . - What ? I think it 's over there . Come on , Iet 's go . But only if we establish a link with the interface dart . We 're gonna blow up S-1 1 's brains , but we can only establish a link if we get close enough to the interface dart and S-1 1 . ( sighs ) Okay . So in other words , what you 're trying to say is that I 've gotta tag that mother with an interface dart and you 've gotta be close enough to blow it to hell ? Yeah , that 's the plan . Better than no plan . Please help me find my son . He 's missing ! calm down . What 's his name ? Mom ! - l got him . Stay here . - He 'll be fine . Just calm down , okay ? ( whimpering ) please . I cannot believe that you didn 't get that shot . I am sick of your attitude . You know what ? I 'm tired about you . I 'm tired about the work . Just go on your way and I 'm going on my way . - Fine . - Boy : Mom ! ( crying ) Jack . Jack , come here . Come to me , buddy. it 's okay . Come on . Trust me , it 's okay . Jack , come on .

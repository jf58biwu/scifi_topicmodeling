( ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ) REPORTER ON TV : Scattered riots broke out across the Kree Empire today protesting the recent peace treaty signed by the Kree Emperor and Xandar 's Nova Prime . ( BEEPING ) Peter , you have call . - No , wait , don 't ! - Quill ? Hey , Yondu . I 'm here on Morag . Ain 't no Orb , ain 't no you . Well , I was in the neighborhood . I thought I 'd save you the hassle . Well , where are you at now , boy ? I feel really bad about this , but I 'm not gonna tell you that . - I slaved putting this deal together . - Slaved ? Making a few calls is " slaved " ? I mean , really ? And now you 're gonna rip me off ! We do not do that to each other . We 're Ravagers . We got a code . Yeah , and that code is " steal from everybody . " When I picked you up on Terra .. " Picked me up . " ... these boys of mine wanted to eat you . Yeah ? They ain 't never tasted any Terran before . I stopped them . You 're alive because of me ! I Will find you , I Will ... ( GRUNTS ) Put a bounty on him ! Forty K. - But I want him back alive . - Yeah , Cap . - Alive ? - That 's what I said . I told you when you picked that kid up , you should have delivered him like we was hired to do ! He was cargo ! You have always been soft on him . You 're the only one I 'm being soft on ! Now , don 't you worry about Mr. Quill . As soon as we get him back here , I 'm gonna kill him myself . What we do need to worry about , is who else out there wants that Orb ! RONAN : They call me " terrorist , " " radical , " " zealot , " because I obey the ancient laws of my people , the Kree , and punish those who do not . Because I do not forgive your people for taking the life of my father , and his father , and his father before him . A thousand years of war between us will not be forgotten ! XANDARIAN : You can 't do this ! Our government signed a peace treaty . RONAN : My government knows no shame . You Xandarians and your culture are a disease . You will never rule Xandar . No . I will cure it ! ( GRUNTING ) Ronan , Korath has returned . KORATH : Master , he is a thief , an outlaw who calls himself Star-Lord . But we have discovered he has an agreement to retrieve the Orb for an intermediary known as The Broker . I promised Thanos I would retrieve the Orb for him . Only then will he destroy Xandar for me . Nebula , go to Xandar and get me the Orb . It will be my honor . It will be your doom . If this happens again , you 'll be facing our father without his prize . I 'm a daughter of Thanos . Just like you . But I know Xandar . Ronan has already decreed that I ... Do not speak for me . You will not fail . Have I ever ? ROCKET : Xandarians . What a bunch of losers . All of them in a big hurry to get from something stupid , to nothing at all . Pathetic . Look at this guy ! Can you believe they call us criminals , when he 's assaulting us with that haircut ? What is this thing ? Look how it thinks it 's so cool . It 's not cool to get help ! Walk by yourself , you little gargoyle . Look at Mr. Smiles over here . ( INAUDIBLE ) Where 's your wife , old man ? What a class-A prevert . ( LAUGHING ) Right , Groot ? Groot ? Don 't drink fountain water , you idiot . - That 's disgusting ! - Mmm . Yes , you did . I just saw you doing it . Why are you lying ? ( ELECTRONIC BEEPING ) Whoop . Looks like we got one . Okay , humie , how bad does someone wanna find you ? 40,000 units ? Groot , we 're gonna be rich . ( GURGLING ) ( SIGHS ) ( DOOR OPENS ) - Mr. Quill . - Broker . The Orb . - As commissioned . - Where 's Yondu ? Wanted to be here . Sends his love . And told me to tell you , that you got the best eyebrows in the business . ( SCOFFS ) What is it ? It 's my policy never to discuss my clients , or their needs . Yeah , well , I almost died getting it for you . An occupational hazard , I 'm sure , in your line of work . Some machine-headed freak , working for a dude named Ronan . Ronan ? I 'm sorry , Mr. Quill . I truly am . But I want no part of this transaction - if Ronan is involved . - Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Who 's Ronan ? A Kree fanatic , outraged by the peace treaty , who will not rest until Xandarian culture , my culture , - is wiped from existence ! - Whoa , whoa ! - Come on . - He 's someone whose bad side I 'd rather not be on . What ? What about my bad side ? Farewell , Mr. Quill . Hey , we had a deal , Bro ! What happened ? Ah , this guy just backed out of a deal on me . If there 's one thing I hate , it 's a man without integrity . Peter Quill . People call me Star-Lord . You have the bearing of a man of honor . Well , you know , I wouldn 't say that . People say it about me , all the time , but it 's not something I would ever say about myself . ( GRUNTS ) ( GROANS ) Ooh ! ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GROANING ) ( GRUNTING ) This wasn 't the plan . Ah ! ROCKET : Put him in the bag . Put him in the bag ! No ! Not her , him ! Learn genders , man . ( SCREAMING ) Ow ! Biting ? That 's not fair ! ROCKET : Take it easy ! ( SCREAMING ) ( GRUNTS ) Ow !

( YELLING IN PAIN ) ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ) ( ROCKET LAUGHING ) Yeah . Writhe , little man . ( GROOT WHIMPERING ) It 'll grow back , you d 'ast idiot . Quit whining . ( RUMBLING ) Subject 89P13 , drop your weapon . Aw , crap . By the authority of the Nova Corps , - you are under arrest ... - All right . Come on up . ... for endangerment to life and the destruction of property . Hey ! If it isn 't Star-Prince . - Star-Lord . - Oh , sorry . " Lord . " I picked this guy up a while back for petty theft . He 's got a code name . ( SCOFFS ) OFFICER : Yeah . Stay out of the way . Come on , man . It 's a ... It 's an outlaw name . Just relax , pal . It 's cool to have a code name . It 's not that weird . ROCKET : Fascists . NOVA PRIME : Ronan is destroying Xandarian outposts throughout the galaxy . I should think that would call for some slight response on the part of the Kree . We signed your peace treaty , Nova Prime . What more do you want ? At least a statement from the Kree Empire saying that they condemn his actions . He is slaughtering children . Families . That is your business . Now , I have other matters to attend to . Prick . ( BEEPS ) well , some good news . It looks like we 've apprehended one of Ronan 's compatriots . DEY : Gamora . Surgically modified and trained as a living weapon . The adopted daughter of the Mad Titan , Thanos . Recently , Thanos lent her and her sister Nebula out to Ronan , which leads us to believe that Thanos and Ronan are working together . Subject 89P13 . Calls itself " Rocket . " The result of illegal genetic and cybernetic experiments on a lower life form . ( SPITS ) What the hell ? DEY : They call it " Groot . " A humanoid plant that 's been travelling recently as 89P13 's personal houseplant / muscle . ( GRUNTING ) Peter Jason Quill , from Terra . Raised from youth by a band of mercenaries called the Ravagers , led by Yondu Udonta . Oh , I 'm sorry . I didn 't know how this machine worked . What a bunch of a-holes . ( CHUCKLES ) SAAL : Transport all four to the Kyln . ROCKET : I guess most of Nova Corps wanna uphold the laws , but these ones here , they 're corrupt and cruel . ( CHUCKLING ) But , hey , that 's not my problem . I ain 't gonna be here long . I 've escaped 22 prisons . This one 's no different . You 're lucky the broad showed up , because otherwise , me and Groot would be collecting that bounty right now , and you 'd be getting drawn and quartered by Yondu and those Ravagers . I 've had a lot of folks try to kill me over the years . I ain 't about to be brought down by a tree and a talking raccoon . Hold . - What 's a raccoon ? PETER : - " What 's a raccoon ? " It 's what you are , stupid . Ain 't no thing like me , except me . So , this Orb has a real shiny blue suitcase , Ark of the Covenant , Maltese Falcon sort of vibe . - What is it ? - I am Groot . So what ? What 's the Orb ? I have no words for an honorless thief . Pretty high and mighty coming from the lackey of a genocidal maniac . Yeah , I know who you are . Anyone who 's anyone knows who you are . Yeah , we know who you are . - Who is she ? - I am Groot . Yeah , you said that . I wasn 't retrieving the Orb for Ronan . I was betraying him . I had an agreement to sell it to a third party . I am Groot . Well , that 's just as fascinating as the first 89 times you told me that . What is wrong with Giving Tree , here ? Well , he don 't know talking good like me and you . So his vocabulistics is limited to " I " and " am " and " Groot . " Exclusively in that order . I tell you what , that 's gonna wear real thin , real fast . ( POP MUSIC PLAYING ON WALKMAN ) Hey . Put that away . ( ELECTRONIC BEEPING ) Hey ! Listen to me , you big blue bastard . Take those headphones off . That 's mine . Those belong to impound . That tape and that player is mine ! ( GRUNTING ) ( STATIC CRACKLING ) Hooked on a Feeling , Blue Swede , 1973 . That song belongs to me ! ( GRUNTING ) ( STATIC CRACKLING ) ( SONG CONTINUES PLAYING ) ( GROANS ) ( ALL SHOUTING ) - You first ! You first ! - Murderer ! Coming for you first , Gamora ! You 're dead ! You 're scum ! You 're scum ! ( SHOUTING CONTINUES ) It 's like I said , she 's got a rep . A lot of prisoners here have lost their families to Ronan and his goons . She 'll last a day , tops . Murderer ! The guards will protect her , right ? They 're here to stop us from getting out . They don 't care what we do to each other inside . Whatever nightmares the future holds , are dreams compared to what 's behind me . Check out the new meat . I 'm gonna slather you up in Gunavian jelly , and go to town ... ( GROANING ) Let 's make something clear . This one here is our booty ! You wanna get to him , you go through us ! Or , more accurately , we go through you . ( BONES CRACKING ) ( GROANING ) ( SOBBING ) I 'm with them . INMATE : I hate you . No cell 's gonna protect you for long . ( INDISTINCT SHOUTING ) ( GASPS ) You 're dead ! Dead ! ( INAUDIBLE ) ( ALL SNORING ) GUARD : Take her down to the showers . It 'll be easier to clean up the blood down there . ( GRUNTS ) Quill , where you going ? Quill . Quill ! ( GRUNTS ) Gamora , consider this a death sentence for your crimes against the galaxy . DRAX : You dare ? You know who I am , yes ? PRISONER : You 're Drax . The Destroyer . Quill ! DRAX : And you know why they call me this . You slayed dozens of Ronan 's minions . Ronan murdered my wife , Ovette , and my daughter , Camaria . He slaughtered them where they stood . And he laughed ! ROCKET : Quill ? DRAX : Her life is not yours to take . He killed my family . I shall kill one of his in return . Of course , Drax . Here , I ... ( GRUNTING ) ( BONES CRACKING ) ( CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY ) ( WHISPERING ) Quill ! What are you doing ? I 'm no family to Ronan or Thanos . ( CLATTERS ) I 'm your only hope at stopping him . ( GRUNTING ) Ah ! Woman , your words mean nothing to me ! - Hey ! Hey , hey , hey ! Hey ! - Oh , crap . You know , if killing Ronan is truly your sole purpose , I don 't think this is the best way to go about it . Are you not the man this wench attempted to kill ? Well , I mean , she 's hardly the first woman to try and do that to me . ( CHUCKLES ) Look , this is from a smoking-hot Rajak girl . Stabbed me with a fork . Didn 't like me skipping out on her at sunrise . I got , right here , a Kree girl tried to rip out my thorax . She caught me with this skinny little A 'askavariian who worked in Nova Records . I was trying to get information . You ever see an A 'askavariian ? They have tentacles , and needles for teeth . If you think I 'm seriously interested in that , then ... You don 't care . But here 's the point . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) She betrayed Ronan . He 's coming back for her . And when he does , that 's when you ... Why would I put my finger on his throat ? What ? Oh , no , it 's a symbol . This is a symbol for you slicing his throat . I would not slice his throat . I would cut his head clean off . It 's a general expression for you killing somebody . You 've heard of this . You 've seen this , right ? - You know what that is . - Yeah . Yeah . - Everyone knows . - No , no . What I 'm saying is , you want to keep her alive . Don 't do his work for him . ( COUGHS ) I like your knife . I 'm keeping it . - That was my favorite knife . PETER : - Listen ! I could care less whether you live or whether you die . - Then why stop the big guy ? - Simple . You know where to sell my Orb . How are we gonna sell it when we and it are still here ? My friend Rocket , here , has escaped 22 prisons . Oh , we 're getting out . And then we 're headed straight to Yondu to retrieve your bounty . How much was your buyer willing to pay you for my Orb ? Four billion units . - What ? - Holy shit . That Orb is my opportunity to get away from Thanos and Ronan . If you free us , I 'll lead you to the buyer directly and I 'll split the profit between the three of us . I am Groot . ROCKET : Four of us . Asleep for the danger , awake for the money , as per frickin ' usual . ( GROANING ) You have been betrayed , Ronan . We know only that she has been captured . Gamora may yet recover the Orb . No ! Our sources within the Kyln say Gamora has her own plans for the Orb . Look , your partnership with Thanos is at risk . Thanos requires your presence . Now ! RONAN : With all due respect , Thanos , your daughter made this mess , and yet you summon me . I would lower my voice , Accuser . First , she lost a battle with some primitive . Thanos put Gamora under your charge . RONAN : Then she was apprehended by the Nova Corps . You are the one here with nothing to show for it . Your sources say that she meant to betray us the whole time ! Lower your tone ! I may be your ... I only ask that you take this matter seriously . The only matter I do not take seriously , boy , is you . Your politics bore me . Your demeanor is that of a pouty child . And , apparently , you alienated my favorite daughter , Gamora . I shall honor our agreement , Kree , if you bring me the Orb . But return to me again empty-handed , and I will bathe the starways in your blood . Thanks , Dad . Sounds fair . This is one fight you won 't win . Let 's head to the Kyln . ROCKET : If we 're gonna get out of here , we 're gonna need to get into that watchtower . And to do that , I 'm gonna need a few things . The guards wear security bands to control their ins and outs . I need one . Leave it to me . ROCKET : That dude , there . I need his prosthetic leg . PETER : His leg ? ROCKET : Yeah . God knows I don 't need the rest of him . Look at him , he 's useless . All right . And finally , on the wall back there is a black panel . Blinky yellow light . - Do you see it ? - Yeah . There 's a quarnyx battery behind it . Purplish box , green wires . To get into that watchtower , I definitely need it . How are we supposed to do that ? Well , supposably , these bald-bodies find you attractive . So , maybe you can work out some sort of trade . You must be joking . No , I really heard they find you attractive . Look , it 's 20 feet up in the air , and it 's in the middle of the most heavily-guarded part of the prison . It 's impossible to get up there without being seen . I got one plan , and that plan requires a frickin ' quarnyx battery , so figure it out ! Oh ! Can I get back to it ? Thanks . Now , this is important . Once the battery is removed , everything is gonna slam into emergency mode . Once we have it , we gotta move quickly , so you definitely need to get that last . ( ALARM BLARING ) Or we could just get it first and improvise . - I 'll get the armband . - Leg . ( GROANING ) GUARD : Prisoner , drop the device immediately and retreat to your cell , or we will open fire . ( ALARM CONTINUES ) I am Groot ! Fire ! ( GRUNTING ) All prisoners return to your sleeping areas . ( GRUNTING ) You idiot ! How am I supposed to fight these things without my stuff ? The animal is in control . Fire on my command ! ( GRUNTING ) Creepy little beast ! ( GUN COCKS ) Oh , yeah . ( BOTH YELLING ) ( LAUGHING ) You need my what ? ( GRUNTING ) - I 'll need this . - Good luck . It 's internally wired . I 'll figure something out . ( GRUNTS ) ( GUARD GROANS ) Drop the leg ! Drop the leg and move back to your cell ! ( GRUNTING ) GAMORA : Rocket ! Move to the watchtower ! ( PRISONERS GRUNTING ) ( HUMMING ) ( GRUNTING ) You ! Man who has lain with an A 'askavariian ! It was one time , man . We need all available guards in full combat gear ... ( ALARM BEEPING ) Whoa ! ( GUARD YELLING ) ( THUDS ) Spare me your foul gaze , woman . Why is this one here ? We promised him he could stay by your side until he kills your boss . I always keep my promises , when they 're to muscle-bound whack-jobs who will kill me if I don 't . Here you go . Oh , I was just kidding about the leg . I just need these two things . - What ? - No , I thought it 'd be funny . Was it funny ? Oh , wait , what did he look like hopping around ? I had to transfer him 30,000 units ! ( CHUCKLING ) DRAX : How are we going to leave ? Well , he 's got a plan . Right ? Or is that another thing you made up ? I have a plan ! I have a plan ! Cease your yammering and relieve us from this irksome confinement . Yeah , I 'll have to agree with the walking thesaurus on that one . Do not ever call me a thesaurus . It 's just a metaphor , dude . His people are completely literal . Metaphors are gonna go over his head . Nothing goes over my head . My reflexes are too fast . I would catch it . I 'm gonna die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy . Those are some big guns . On my command ! Number one ! Rodent , we are ready for your plan . Hold on ! Number two ! I recognize this animal . We 'd roast them over a flame pit as children . Their flesh was quite delicious . Not helping ! Number three ! ( CRACKING ) All fire on my command ! Three ! Two ! One ! ( POWERING DOWN ) GAMORA : He turned off the artificial gravity , everywhere but in here . ( GRUNTS ) ( MACHINE POWERS UP ) ( GRUNTS ) I told you I had a plan . ( GASPS ) ( GRUNTS ) That was a pretty good plan . Huh ? Yeah ! There it is . Get my ship . It 's the Milano , the orange and blue one over in the corner . They crumpled my pants up into a ball . That 's rude ! They folded yours . The Orb 's there . Let 's go . - Wait , wait , wait . - What ? That bastard didn 't put it back . - Put what back ? - Here . Get them to the ship . I will be right back . - How are you gonna possibly ... - Just keep the Milano close by . Go . Go ! ( SIGHS ) ( GROANING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( GROANING ) Ah , my neck ! ( GROANS ) ROCKET : Well , how 's he gonna get to us ? GAMORA : He declined to share that information with me . Well , screw this , then ! I ain 't waiting around for some humie with a death wish . You got the Orb , right ? Yes . ( POP SONG PLAYING OVER WALKMAN ) ( GRUNTS ) If we don 't leave now , we will be blown to bits . No ! We 're not leaving without the Orb . Behold . This one shows spirit . He shall make a keen ally in the battle against Ronan . Companion , what were you retrieving ? ( CASSETTE TAPE EJECTS ) ( SIGHS ) You 're an imbecile . ( ROCKET HUMMING ) PETER : Whoa , whoa , whoa . Yo , Ranger Rick ! What are you doing ? You can 't take apart my ship without asking me ! - See , what is this ? - Don 't touch that ! It 's a bomb . - A bomb ? - Yup . And you leave it lying around ? I was gonna put it in a box . What 's a box gonna do ? - How about this one ? - No ! Whoa . Hey ! - Leave it alone . - Why ? What is it ? - Shut up . - Hey ! ( SCOFFS ) What is that ? That 's for if things get really hardcore . Or if you wanna blow up moons . No one 's blowing up moons . You just wanna suck the joy out of everything . So , listen , I 'm gonna need your buyer 's coordinates . We 're heading in the right direction . For now . If we 're gonna work together , you might try trusting me a little bit . And how much do you trust me ? I 'd trust you a lot more if you told me what this was . Because I 'm guessing it 's some kind of weapon . I don 't know what it is . If it 's a weapon , we should use it against Ronan . Put it down , you fool . You 'll destroy us all . Or just you , murderess ! I let you live once , princess ! - I am not a princess ! PETER : - Hey ! Nobody is killing anybody on my ship ! We 're stuck together until we get the money . I have no interest in money . Great . That means more money for the three of us . ( GROOT HUFFING ) Mmm ? ( SIGHS ) For the four of us . Partners . We have an agreement , but I would never be partners with the likes of you . I 'll tell the buyer we 're on our way . And Quill , your ship is filthy . Oh , she has no idea . If I had a black light , the place would look like a Jackson Pollock painting . You got issues , Quill . ( GRUNTING ) GUARD : I swear . I don 't know where they went ! I swear . NEBULA : If he knew where they were headed , he would have already told us . Yeah . Ronan , the Nova Corps sent a fleet to defend the prison . Well , then , send Necrocraft to every corner of the quadrant . Find the Orb . Any means , any price . And this place ? The Nova can 't know what we 're after . ( GUARD SCREAMING ) Cleanse it ! Do you got any other cute little buggers like this one ? I like to stick ' em all in a row on my control console . I can 't tell if you 're joking or not . He 's being fully serious . In that case , I can show you ... ( CHUCKLING ) But first , you gonna tell me what this Orb is , and why everybody cares so damn much about it . And then you gonna tell me , who out there might wanna buy it . Sir , the high-end community is a ... ( TALKING GIBBERISH ) The high-end community is a ... ( TALKING GIBBERISH ) It 's a tight-knit ... Tight-knit ... The high-end community is a very tight-knit ... ( TALKING GIBBERISH ) ( SCOFFS ) I cannot possibly betray the confidentiality of my buyers ! ( WHISTLES ) ( LAUGHING ) Now , who again is this buyer of yours ? TIVAN : Carina . Yes , Master . TIVAN : Your people do have elbows , do they not ? We do , Master . TIVAN : Then use them . I don 't have to remind you what happened to the last attendant who disappointed me . Do I ? Chop , chop . Our guests will be here soon . ( ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ) ROCKET : Heads up ! We 're inbound . Whoa . What is it ? GAMORA : It 's called Knowhere . The severed head of an ancient celestial being . Be wary headed in , rodent . There are no regulations whatsoever here . GAMORA : Hundreds of years ago , the Tivan Group sent workers in to mine the organic matter within the skull . Bone , brain tissue , spinal fluid . All rare resources , highly valued in black markets across the galaxy . It 's dangerous and illegal work , suitable only for outlaws . Well , I come from a planet of outlaws . Billy the Kid , Bonnie and Clyde , John Stamos . It sounds like a place , which I would like to visit . Yeah , you should . KID : Excuse me . - Watch your wallets . - Can you spare any units ? PETER : Get out of here . Your buyer 's in there ? We are to wait here for his representative . BOUNCER : Get out of here ! ( MAN GROANS ) This is no respectable establishment . What do you expect us to do while we wait ? ( ALL CHEERING ) Yes ! Yes ! Whoa ! ( SQUEALING ) Yahoo ! ( CHITTERING ) ( SCREECHING ) My Orloni has won , as I won at all things ! Now , let 's put more of this liquid into our bodies . That 's the first thing you said that wasn 't bat-shit crazy ! Man , you wouldn 't believe what they charge for fuel out here . I might actually lose money on this job . GAMORA : My connection is making us wait . It 's just a negotiation tactic . Trust me , this is my specialty . Where yours is more , " Stab , stab . Those are my terms . " My father didn 't stress diplomacy . Thanos ? He 's not my father . When Thanos took my home world , he killed my parents in front of me . He tortured me , turned me into a weapon . When he said he was going to destroy an entire planet for Ronan , I couldn 't stand by and ... Why would you risk your life for this ? ( WALKMAN CLICKS ) ( ROMANTIC POP SONG PLAYING ) My mother gave it to me . My mom liked sharing with me all the pop songs that she loved growing up . I happened to have it on me , when I was ... The day that she ... You know , when I left Earth . GAMORA : What do you do with it ? Do ? Nothing . You listen to it . Or you can dance . I 'm a warrior and an assassin . I do not dance . Really ? On my planet , there 's a legend about people like you . It 's called Footloose . And in it , a great hero named Kevin Bacon , teaches an entire city full of people with sticks up their butts that dancing , well ... It 's the greatest thing there is . Who put the sticks up their butts ? What ? No , that 's just a ... - That is cruel . - It 's just a phrase people use . ( MUSIC PLAYING ) ( SHOUTING ) The melody is pleasant ! - No ! - Ow ! What the hell ? I know who you are , Peter Quill ! And I am not some starry-eyed waif here to succumb to your ... Your pelvic sorcery ! That is not what is happening here . ( INDISTINCT SHOUTING ) Oh , no . ( GRUNTING ) ( STRUGGLING ) ( GRUNTING ) Stop it ! Whoa , whoa , what are you doing ? This vermin speaks of affairs he knows nothing about ! - That is true ! - He has no respect ! - That is also true ! - Hold on ! Hold on ! ROCKET : Keep calling me vermin , tough guy ! You just wanna laugh at me like everyone else ! Rocket , you 're drunk . All right ? No one 's laughing at you . He thinks I 'm some stupid thing ! He does ! Well , I didn 't ask to get made ! I didn 't ask to be torn apart , and put back together , over and over and turned into some ... ( INHALES ) Some little monster ! Rocket , no one 's calling you a monster . He called me " vermin " ! She called me " rodent " ! Let 's see if you can laugh after five or six good shots to your frickin ' face ! ( STAMMERING ) No , no , no , no ! Four billion units ! Rocket ! Come on , man . Hey ! Suck it up for one more lousy night and you 're rich . Fine . But I can 't promise , when all this is over I 'm not gonna kill every last one of you jerks . See ? That 's exactly why none of you have any friends ! Five seconds after you meet somebody , you 're already trying to kill them ! We have travelled , halfway across the quadrant . And Ronan is no closer to being dead . - Drax ! - Let him go . We don 't need him . CARINA : Milady Gamora . I 'm here to fetch you for my master . Okay , this isn 't creepy at all . We house the galaxy 's largest collection of fauna , relics , and species of all manner . ( GROWLING ) ( MUFFLED BARKING ) I present to you , Taneleer Tivan , The Collector . Oh , my dear Gamora . How wonderful to meet in the flesh . Let 's bypass the formalities , Tivan . We have what we discussed . What is that thing there ? I am Groot . TIVAN : I never thought I 'd meet a Groot . Sir ... You must allow me to pay you now so that I may own your carcass . At the moment of your death , of course . I am Groot . Why , so he could turn you into a frickin ' chair ? That 's your pet ? - His what ? - Tivan . We have been halfway around the galaxy , retrieving this Orb . Very well , then . Let us see what you brought . DISPATCHER : Three quarnyx batteries , seven cases of Cotati seeds . No , cases . Last time , you sent me ... Uh ... You shall send a message for me . Oh , my new friends . Before creation itself , there were six singularities . Then the universe exploded into existence , and the remnants of these systems were forged into concentrated ingots . ( WHIRRING ) Infinity Stones . These stones , it seems , can only be brandished by beings of extraordinary strength . Observe . These carriers can use the Stone to mow down entire civilizations like wheat in a field . There 's a little pee coming out of me right now . Once , for a moment , a group was able to share the energy amongst themselves , but even they were quickly destroyed by it . Beautiful . Beyond compare . Blah , blah , blah . We 're all very fascinated , whitey . But we 'd like to get paid . TIVAN : How would you like to get paid ? ROCKET : What do you think , fancy man ? Units ! TIVAN : Very well , then . Carina . Stand back . I will no longer be your slave ! No ! ( GRUNTS ) ( SCREAMING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( BOTH YELLING ) What the ... ( GRUNTS ) How could I think Tivan could contain whatever was within the Orb ? What do you still have it for ? PETER : What are we gonna do , leave it in there ? I can 't believe you had that in your purse ! It 's not a purse , it 's a knapsack ! We have to bring this to the Nova Corps . There 's a chance they can contain it . ROCKET : Are you kidding me ? We 're wanted by the Nova Corps . Just give it to Ronan ! So he can destroy the galaxy ? What are you , some saint all of a sudden ? What has the galaxy ever done for you ? Why would you wanna save it ? Because I 'm one of the idiots who lives in it ! Peter , listen to me . We cannot allow the Stone to fall into Ronan 's hands . We have to go back to your ship , and deliver it to Nova . Right , right , okay . I think you 're right . Or we could give it to somebody who 's not going to arrest us , who 's really nice for a whole lot of money . I think it 's a really good balance between both of your points of view . You 're despicable . Dishonorable . Faithless ! - Oh , no . DRAX : - At last ! ( LAUGHING ) I shall meet my foe and destroy him . You called Ronan ? YONDU : Quill ! Don 't you move , boy ! Don 't you move ! Get out of the way ! Ronan the Accuser ! You are the one who transmitted the message ? DRAX : You killed my wife . You killed my daughter ! I told you , you can 't fit . Now , wait here . I 'll be back . It is Gamora . She is escaping with the Orb . ( SPEAKING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE ) No ! RONAN : Nebula , retrieve the Orb . ( GRUNTING ) NEBULA : The Stone is in the furthest pod . Bring it down ! Ah ! ( GRUNTS ) Rocket , keep them off Gamora until she gets to the Milano . How ? We 've got no weaponry on these things . These pods are industrial grade . They 're nearly indestructible . Not against necroblasts , they 're not . That 's not what I 'm saying . Oh ! ( YELLING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GROANS ) PETER : Let me borrow your ride . ( GRUNTING ) ( BONES CRACKING ) ( SCREAMING ) I don 't recall killing your family . I doubt I 'll remember killing you , either . ( GRUNTING ) Quill , I 'm trapped . I can 't make it to the Milano . I have to head out . Wait ! These things aren 't meant to go out there . You are a disappointment , sister . Of all our siblings , I hated you least . GAMORA : Nebula , please . If Ronan gets this stone - he 'll kill us all . NEBULA : - Not all . You will already be dead . NEBULA : Ronan , it is done . ROCKET : Quill , come on . Her body mods should keep her alive a couple more minutes , but there 's nothing we can do for her . These pods aren 't meant to be out here . In a second , we 're gonna be in the same boat . Aw , damn it . ROCKET : Quill ? Yondu ! Yondu . This is Quill ! - My coordinates are 227K324 . ROCKET : - Quill . Quill , what are you doing ? Just outside Knowhere . If you 're there , come get me . I 'm all yours . ROCKET : Quill , don 't be ridiculous . Get back into your pod ! You can 't fit two people in there . You 're gonna die . You 'll die in seconds ! Quill . ( GAMORA GASPS ) ( GASPING ) ( COUGHING ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Quill ? What happened ? I saw you out there . I don 't know what came over me . But I couldn 't let you die . I found something inside of myself . Something incredibly heroic . I mean , not to brag , but , objectively ... ( SIGHS DEEPLY ) Where 's the Orb ? It 's ... Well , they got the Orb . What ? ( DOOR OPENS ) Welcome home , Peter . ( COUGHING ) ( INHALING DEEPLY ) Blasted idiot . They 're all idiots ! ( GRUNTS ) Quill just got himself captured . None of this ever would have happened if you didn 't try to single-handedly take on a frickin ' army ! ( SIGHS ) You 're right . I was a fool . All the anger , all the rage , was just to cover my loss . ( SIGHS ) Oh , boo-hoo-hoo . " My wife and child are dead . " ( GASPS ) Oh , I don 't care if it 's mean ! Everybody 's got dead people . It 's no excuse to get everybody else dead along the way ! Come on , Groot . Ronan has the Stone . The only chance we got is to get to the other side of the universe as fast as we can and maybe , just maybe , we 'll be able to live full lives before that whack-job ever gets there . I am Groot . Save them ? How ? I am Groot . I know they 're the only friends that we ever had , but there 's an army of Ravagers around them . And there 's only two of us ! Three . ( GRUNTING ) Aw ! You 're making me beat ... up grass ! RONAN : The Orb is in my possession , as I promised . Bring it to me . Yes , that was our agreement . Bring you the Orb , and you will destroy Xandar for me . However , now that I know it contains an Infinity Stone , I wonder what use I have for you . Boy , I would reconsider your current course . Master ! You cannot ! Thanos is the most powerful being in the universe . Not anymore . You call me " boy ! " I will unfurl 1,000 years of Kree justice on Xandar , and burn it to its core ! Then , Thanos , I am coming for you . After Xandar , you are going to kill my father ? You dare to oppose me ? You see what he has turned me into . If you kill him , I will help you destroy a thousand planets . YONDU : You betray me ? ( PETER GROANS ) Steal my money ? Stop it ! Leave him alone ! When I picked you up as a kid , these boys wanted to eat you . They ain 't never tasted Terran before . I saved your life ! Oh , will you shut up about that ? God ! Twenty years , you been throwing that in my face , like it 's some great thing , not eating me . Normal people don 't even think about eating someone else ! Much less that person having to be grateful for it ! You abducted me , man . You stole me from my home and from my family . You don 't give a damn about your Terra ! You 're scared because you 're soft in here . Here , right here ! GAMORA : Yondu ! Listen to me . Ronan has something called an Infinity Stone . I know what he 's got , girl . Then you know we must get it back ! He 's gonna use it to wipe out Xandar . We have to warn them . Billions of people will perish . Is that what she 's been filling your head with , boy ? Sentiment ? ( ALL LAUGHING ) Eating away your brain like maggots ! That 's it . ( WHISTLES ) No ! Sorry , boy . But a captain 's gotta teach his men what happens to those what cross him . Captain 's gotta teach stuff ! ( ALL AGREEING ) If you kill me now , you are saying goodbye to the biggest score you have ever seen . The Stone ? I hope you got something better than that . Because ain 't nobody stealing from Ronan . We got a ringer . Is that right ? She knows everything there is to know about Ronan . His ships , his army . He 's vulnerable . Hey , what do you say , Yondu , huh ? Me and you , taking down a mark side-by-side , like the old days . ( PETER CHUCKLES ) ( WHISTLES ) ( LAUGHS ) Let him go ! ( ALL LAUGHING ) You always did have a scrote , boy ! That 's why I kept you on as a young 'un . ( RUMBLING ) ( EXPLOSION ) Captain , the shot was non-damaging . ROCKET : Attention , idiots . The lunatic on top of this craft is holding a Hadron Enforcer . It 's a weapon of my own design . What the hell ? If you don 't hand over our companions now , he 's gonna tear your ship a new one . A very big new one ! - I ain 't buying ' it . - I 'm giving you to the count of five . - 5 , 4 , 3 ... - No ! Wait , hold on ! Rocket , it 's me , for God sakes ! We figured it out ! We 're fine ! ROCKET : Oh , hey , Quill . What 's going on ? You call that " figured it out " ? We 're gonna rob the guys who just beat us senseless . Oh , you want to talk about senseless ? How about trying to save us by blowing us up ? We were only gonna blow you up if they didn 't turn you over ! And how on earth were they gonna turn us over when you only gave them a count of five ? We didn 't have time to work out the minutiae of the plan . This is what we get for acting altruistically . - I am Groot . - They are ungrateful . What 's important now is we get the Ravagers ' army to help us save Xandar . So we can give the Stone to Yondu who 's just gonna sell to somebody even worse ? We 'll figure that part out later . We have to stop Ronan . How ? I have a plan . You 've got a plan ? Yes . First of all , you 're copying me from - when I said I had a plan . - No , I 'm not . People say that all the time . It 's not that unique of a thing to say . Secondly , I don 't even believe you have a plan . I have part of a plan ! What percentage of a plan do you have ? You don 't get to ask questions after the nonsense you pulled on Knowhere . I just saved Quill . We 've already established that you destroying the ship that I 'm on is not saving me . - When did we establish it ? - Like three seconds ago ! I wasn 't listening . I was thinking of something else . ( GROANS ) She 's right . You don 't get an opinion . What percentage ? I don 't know . Twelve percent . Twelve percent ? ( LAUGHS ) That 's a fake laugh . - It 's real ! - Totally fake . That is the most real , authentic , hysterical laugh of my entire life because that is not a plan . It 's barely a concept . You 're taking their side ? I am Groot . So what , it 's better than 11 % ? What the hell does that have to do with anything ? Thank you , Groot . Thank you . See ? Groot 's the only one of you who has a clue . ( CHOMPING ) ( SCOFFS ) Guys . Come on . Yondu is gonna be here in two seconds . He expects to hear this big plan of ours . I need your help . I look around at us . You know what I see ? Losers . I mean , like , folks who have lost stuff . And we have . Man , we have . All of us . Our homes , our families , normal lives . And , usually , life takes more than it gives . But not today . Today , it 's given us something . It has given us a chance . To do what ? To give a shit . For once . Not run away . I , for one , am not gonna stand by and watch as Ronan wipes out billions of innocent lives . But , Quill , stopping Ronan , it 's impossible . You 're asking us to die . ( SIGHS ) Yeah , I guess I am . ( STAMMERS ) GAMORA : Quill . I have lived most my life surrounded by my enemies . I will be grateful to die among my friends . You are an honorable man , Quill . I will fight beside you . And in the end , I will see my wife and daughter again . I am Groot . ( SIGHS ) Oh , what the hell . I don 't got that long a lifespan , anyway . Now I 'm standing . Y 'all happy ? We 're all standing up now . Bunch of jackasses , standing in a circle . ( WALKMAN CLICKS ) ( ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ) GAMORA : The Stone reacts to anything organic . The bigger the target , the bigger the power surge . All Ronan 's got to do is touch the Stone to the planet 's surface and zap . All plants , animals , - Nova Corps . GAMORA : - Everything will die . So Ronan does not make the surface . ( WHIRRING ) PETER : Rocket will lead a team to blow a hole in the Dark Aster 's starboard hull . Then , our craft and Yondu 's will enter . Won 't there be hundreds of Sakaaran soldiers inside ? I think of Sakaaran as paper people . Once they know we 're on board , Ronan will isolate himself behind impenetrable security doors on deck . Which I can disable by dismantling the power source . PETER : We 'll make it to the flight deck , and I 'll use the Hadron Enforcer to kill Ronan . Once Ronan is dead , we will retrieve the Stone . Use these devices to contain it . If you touch it , it will kill you . PETER : I 'll contact one of the Nova officers who arrested us . ( RINGING ) Hopefully , they 'll believe we 're there to help . There 's one more thing we need to complete the plan . That guy 's eye . No ! No , we don 't . No , we don 't need that guy 's eye . No , seriously , I need it ! It 's important to me . ( GIGGLES ) AUTOMATED VOICE : Ronan 's fleet has been spotted , and will arrive in T-minus fifteen minutes . Remember , boy . At the end of all this , I get the Stone . You cross me , we kill you all . ( MUSIC PLAYING ) Let 's go get ' em , boys ! This is a terrible plan . Hey , you 're the one who said you wanted to die among friends . Nova Prime . I received a transmission from one of the Ravagers . He says Ronan 's in possession of something called an Infinity Stone and he 's headed toward Xandar . Good God . It 's a trick . He 's a criminal . NOVA PRIME : Did he say why we should believe him ? He said his crew just escaped from prison so he 'd have no other reason to risk coming to Xandar to help . He says that he 's an " a-hole . " But he 's not , and I 'm quoting him , here , " 100 % a dick . " Do you believe him ? I don 't know that I believe anyone is 100 % a dick , ma 'am . I mean , do you believe that he is here to help ? Yeah . A fleet approaches . They appear to be Ravagers . ( WHIRRING ) Fire ! YONDU : Cover it down . Submerge ! Rocket , hurry ! All pilots , dive ! They 're beneath us ! NOVA PRIME : Evacuate the city . Our priority is to get our people away from the battle . Forward thrust , now ! ( GRUNTING ) Come on ! Quill ! Yondu ! Now ! YONDU : Aw , hell ! I 'm going down , Quill ! ( ALARM BLARING ) No more games with me , boy ! I 'll see you at the end of this ! There are too many of them , Rocket ! We 'll never make it up there ! SAAL : Peter Quill . This is Denarian Saal of the Nova Corps . For the record , I advised against trusting you here . They got my " dick " message ! Prove me wrong . ( ENGINE REVS ) Yes ! ( LAUGHS ) Yes ! ( DRAX LAUGHING ) ( EXHALES ) We 're just like Kevin Bacon . ( LASERS FIRING ) The starboard kern has been breached ! We have been boarded . Continue our approach . But the Nova Corps have engaged . None of that will matter once we reach the surface . Seal security doors ! Now ! ( SPEAKS NATIVE LANGUAGE ) NEBULA : Get out of my way ! Oh , man . All Nova pilots , interlock and form a blockade . The Dark Aster must not reach the ground . ( ZAPS ) NOVA CORPS PILOT 1 : Locked in ! NOVA CORPS PILOT 2 : Locked in . We 're locked in . I can barely see . When did you learn to do that ? Pretty sure the answer is " I am Groot . " The flight deck is 300 meters this way . I want you all to know that I am grateful for your acceptance after my blunders . It is pleasing to once again have friends . You , Quill , are my friend . Thanks . - This dumb tree , he is my friend . GROOT : - Mmm . And this green whore , she , too ... Oh , you must stop ! ( NEBULA GRUNTS ) Gamora , look at what you have done . You have always been weak . You stupid , traitorous ... Nobody talks to my friends like that . Head to the flight deck . I 'll shut down the power to the security doors . ( DISTANT EXPLOSIONS ) GUARD : Yondu Udonta . Order your men to turn on the Nova Corps . ( WHISTLES ) Enough nonsense , Ravager ! Time to die ... ( WHISTLES ) ( WHISTLES ) ( GROANS ) ( BONE CRACKS ) ( WHIRRING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTS ) Nebula , please . ( GRUNTS ) ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLES ) ( SCREAMS ) Enough of this . Necrocraft pilots , enact immolation initiative . STARBLASTER PILOT : They 're dive-bombing the city ! Denarian Saal , should we break formation ? No ! Hold your positions . ( EXPLOSIONS ) ( ALL CLAMORING ) Keep Ronan up there , Saal . We 'll take care of the people down here . I can 't believe I 'm taking orders from a hamster . Star-Lord . Finally . ( GRUNTS ) Ah ! You thief ! ( DRAX YELLS ) ( YELLING ) ( YELLING ) You will never make it to Ronan . Everybody shoot them before they hit the ground . Come on ! ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( ROARS ) ( GRUNTS ) ( SCREAMS ) Finger to the throat means death . ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ) Metaphor . Yeah , sorta . Oh , no . ( GRUNTS ) ( GROOT YELLING ) RONAN : Xandar ! You stand accused . Your wretched peace treaty will not save you now . It is the tinder on which you burn . ( GROANS ) Rocket ! Hold on , Saal , just ... ( SCREAMS ) Quill , you gotta hurry . The city 's been evacuated , but we 're getting our asses kicked down here . Gamora hasn 't opened the door ! ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( GAMORA SCREAMS ) ( YELLS ) GAMORA : Nebula ! Sister , help us fight Ronan . You know he 's crazy . I know you 're both crazy . No ! - What the ... ? - Ah ! NEBULA : Get out ! ( MAN SCREAMING ) ( GUN POWERING UP ) You did it ! ( SCREAMS ) ( CHOKING ) I was mistaken . I do remember your family . Their screams were pitiful . I ... ( STARSHIP APPROACHING ) ( SCREAMS ) ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ) ( SHIP RUMBLING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( RUMBLES ) No , Groot ! You can 't . You 'll die . Why are you doing this ? Why ? We are Groot . ( POP MUSIC PLAYING FAINTLY ) ( MOANS ) ( GROANS ) I called him an idiot . ( WHIMPERS ) You killed Groot ! ( SCREAMS ) Behold ! Your guardians of the galaxy . What fruit have they wrought ? Only that my father and his father shall finally know vengeance . People of Xandar , the time has come to rejoice and renounce your paltry gods ! Your salvation is at hand . ( SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE ) ( PETER SINGING ALONG TO POP SONG ) Listen to these words . ( CONTINUES SINGING ) Now bring it down hard ! What are you doing ? Dance-off , Bro . Me and you . ( MUSIC PLAYING ) Gamora . Subtle . Take it back . What are you doing ? I 'm distracting you , you big turd blossom . ( GUN COCKS ) No ! ( EXPLOSIONS ) Peter ! Take my hand ! Take my hand , Peter . Mom . GAMORA : Take my hand ! You 're mortal ! How ? You said it yourself , bitch . We 're the Guardians of the Galaxy . ( GROWLS ) ( ALL PANTING ) YONDU : Well , well , well . Quite the light show . ( CHUCKLES ) Ain 't this sweet . ( GUN COCKS ) But you got some business to attend to before all the nookie-nookie starts . Peter , you can 't . Peter . You gotta reconsider this , Yondu . I don 't know who you 're selling this to , but the only way the universe can survive is if you give it to the Nova Corps . I may be as pretty as an angel , but I sure as hell ain 't one . Hand it over , son . ( LAUGHS ) Yondu . Do not open that Orb . You know that , right ? You 've seen what it does to people . ( YONDU LAUGHS ) Yeah , Quill turned out okay . It 's probably good we didn 't deliver him to his dad like we was hired to do . Yeah , that guy was a jackass . He is gonna be so pissed when he realizes I switched out the Orb on him . ( CHUCKLES ) He was gonna kill you , Peter . Oh , I know . But he was about the only family I had . No . He wasn 't . ( SNIFFLING ) ( SOBBING ) ( SNIFFLES ) ( GROANS ) ( SOBS ) ( SNIFFS ) ( ROCKET SIGHS ) PETER : Why would you even know this ? DEY : When we arrested you , we noticed an anomaly in your nervous system , so we had it checked out . I 'm not Terran ? NOVA PRIME : You are half Terran . Your mother was of Earth . Your father , well , he 's something very ancient we 've never seen here before . That could be why you were able to hold the Stone for as long as you did . ( DOOR OPENING ) Your friends have arrived . On behalf of the Nova Corps , we 'd like to express our profound gratitude for your help in saving Xandar . If you will follow Denarian Dey , he has something to show you . Thank you , Nova Prime . Your wife and child shall rest well knowing that you have avenged them . Yes . Of course , Ronan was only a puppet . It 's really Thanos I need to kill . We tried to keep it as close to the original as possible . We salvaged as much as we could . Wow . I ... Thank you . I have a family . They 're alive because of you . Your criminal records have also been expunged . However , I have to warn you against breaking any laws in the future . ROCKET : Question . What if I see something that I want to take , and it belongs to someone else ? DEY : You will be arrested . But what if I want it more than the person who has it ? - It 's still illegal . - That doesn 't follow . No , I want it more , sir . Do you understand ? What are you laughing at ? Why ? I can 't have a discussion with this gentleman ? What if someone does something irksome and I decide to remove his spine ? That 's ... That 's actually murder . It 's one of the worst crimes of all . So ... also illegal . Hmm . They 'll be fine , Dey . I 'm gonna keep an eye on ' em . You ? Yeah . Me . ( PAPER RUSTLES ) MEREDITH : Peter , I know these last few months have been hard for you . But I 'm going to a better place . And I will be okay . And I will always be with you . You are the light of my life . My precious son . My little Star-Lord . Love , Mom . ( CLICKS ) ( RB MUSIC PLAYING ) ( KNOB CLICKS ) ( LAUGHTER ) ( BEEPS ) ( YAWNS ) PETER : So , what should we do next ? Something good ? Something bad ? A bit of both ? We 'll follow your lead , Star-Lord . Bit of both . ( STARSHIP REVVING ) ( SOUL MUSIC PLAYING ) HOWARD : What do you let it lick you like that for ? Gross . ( SIPS ) Yeah ! But it burns going down . ( LIPS SMACKING AND GULPING )

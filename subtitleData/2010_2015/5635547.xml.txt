 My name is Stephen Jameson . And I am one of the Tomorrow People . They call our powers the three T 's . - Telepathy ... - Stephen ? Telekinesis ... And teleportation . There is a shadow war going on between us and Ultra ... - No ! - ... the secret organization that hunts us . The only way to keep my species from going extinct is to find my father . And the only way to do that is by working for the enemy . Previously on The Tomorrow People ... - A tracer . - It 's a tracking device , actually . Each dot represents a paranormal tagged and released . You will lead them all to The Refuge . You gotta call Stephen and your friends , now ! What do you need ? I think you may have to guide him back . I need to get into the machine at Ultra . Dad , come on . It 's a heartbeat . His father 's alive . And you 're sure Stephen has no idea he 's been led exactly where we want him ? None . I can 't believe my brother put you , of all people , up to this . You don 't have to do this , John . Why 'd you have to turn against Ultra ? I was protecting our kind . Now put the gun down . Ugh ! Hey . There you are . Why don 't you get some sleep ? I 'm fine . I 'm used to 36-hour shifts . Besides , Luca 's gonna be up soon . Okay , why don 't you go see Luca . I 'll keep an eye on things here . There 's a little pool going around about who 's gonna crash first . You or me . And it will not be me . I feel like if I close my eyes now , I might not wake up . He 's gonna pull through , Mom . Honey , we may have gotten your father 's heart to beat , but the rest of him ... You two better get in here . Dad . Didn 't mean to scare you . You 're back . Ah , sure feels that way . Unless I 'm dead and this is Heaven . Which would explain a lot . - Oh , my God , you 're beautiful . - Oh , my ... Is this okay ? Yeah , that 's perfect . I don 't believe it . Thanks for bringing me back from the dead . Ah , well , uh ... it was a team effort . John . Roger , I , uh ... - I 'm sorry . - No . You only did what you were supposed to do . The burden my brother and I placed on you is ... I 'm sorry . - Where 's Jedikiah ? - Oh , dude skipped out a while ago . Picked a hell of a time to leave . So ... tell me how you did it . I brought you back . Mom patched up your body , and I used the Machine at Ultra to bring back the rest of you . The Machine ? The Founder 's still alive ? He doesn 't know that you are . I need you to walk me through everything you know about his plans . Hold on . Can we have a minute , please ? After everything we 've been through , you 're just gonna pick up where you left off ? I mean , you think that 's why we brought you back ? - Marla , I 'm sorry ... - I need to go home and check in on Luca . I think you should come home and see your son . - Look , Dad , I should , um ... - You should go . Hey , stranger , where you been ? You 're not gonna believe what just happened . Oh , yeah ? Try me . My dad woke up . That 's great , right ? Yeah , it 's pretty great . Well , I don 't want to keep you from your family , but , um , if there 's anything you need ... Mind covering for me at Ultra for a little longer ? And , obviously , nobody can know about my dad . Like I said , anything you need . Thank you , you 're the best . I know . How thrilled Stephen must be to have his father back . But for us , it 's hardly a cause for celebration . The man has been frozen . You really think he 's still a threat ? Not even your partner , a synergist , has been able to match his father 's powers . And besides , it took me six years . Six years to rebuild what he destroyed . What do you want me to do ? Get close to Roger and bring him in . How ? Oh , Agent Cole , you 've got the boy eating out of your hand . You 'll figure it out . So , what now ? Is he gonna throw on a cape and take us straight to the Refuge ? Natalie , the dude just thawed out . One miracle at a time . Oh ! I 'm ... I 'm sorry , I didn 't realize you were in here . I was just trying to imagine how people dressed topside these days . Does this work ? Timeless . But who said anything about going topside ? I 've been trapped between the here and the hereafter for way too long . I have to go home . Roger , our people believe that you 're their savior . You can 't just walk out on them . I already gave up one life , Cara . It 's my family 's turn . I 'll be back . Ultra is still out there . If you get caught , you could be ... I appreciate the concern . But I 'm pretty sure I broke out before you were born . I can handle it . I know that you missed out on a lot with your family . But I 'm responsible for the safety of everyone down here now . I 'm sorry , I can 't let you leave . Well , I guess we 're at an impasse . You remember how we settle impasses . I don 't want to fight you , Cara . Maybe you 'd prefer to jaunt me . This is the only way ? You made the rules , didn 't you ? I 'll clear the room . We don 't have to do this , John . If there was something you wanted to discuss , you should 've said so . This isn 't about me . This is about them . Hey , what 's going on ? Why is everyone getting kicked out of ... Holy Ali-Frazier , is this for real ? Go ahead , John . It 's all yours . Not pulling any punches , are you ? What is John doing ? It 's like he 's ... He wants to get hurt . I 'm going to see my family . Who the hell are we ? I spent six years thinking I killed the man who could 've saved us . Now he 's abandoning you all over again . All of us . Only this time I can 't create another hero myth . This time , we need the real thing . I didn 't hear you come in . Not much has changed . Everything has changed . Hmm . Yeah . I know I can 't make up for the lost time , and ... You have a whole life that I 'm not a part of . Whatever I can do to make it easier , I will . Just ... Be here . - Hey , honey . - Hello , Luca . I know this is a lot to take in ... Luca , you 're staying . No can do , bro , I have a plans tonight . So cancel them . Well , what am I supposed to say ? " Hey guys . Sorry , uh , raincheck . " My dead dad is suddenly back from the netherworld . " Well , I wouldn 't get that specific . How is he even here ? Doesn 't matter . He is , okay ? He 's our dad . And he 's making dinner . Guy doesn 't know a thing about me . Great , you 'll have lots to talk about . Let 's go . This is gonna be the most awkward-ass night of my life . We need a buffer . Hey , thank you for coming . Of course . You wanna meet my dad ? Again ? - Yeah . - Come on . Dad ? You remember Astrid ? - Astrid . - Hey . What happened to that chubby-cheeked little girl ? Little girl got all growed up . - Astrid , you look lovely . - Thanks . Dinner 's ready , let 's eat . I got it . I wonder who that is ? Dead grandpa ? - Hey . - Hey , um ... what are you doing here ? Interrupting , apparently . - No . - Not at all . - I 'm Stephen 's dad , Roger . - Hillary . Nice to meet you . Do you like chicken parmesan ? Of course you do , what 's not to like ? Come , eat . - Well , I don 't want to interrupt family time . - Come on , come in . Okay , maybe just a bite . This is nice . Having everyone together for dinner . Yeah . Dad , your chicken parm 's even better than I remember . I can 't do this . - Luca . - What ? Am I supposed to just sit here and pretend like this is normal ? That we 're normal ? That Dad hasn 't been gone for ten years ? That my mom and brother aren 't mutants ? - Okay , this is not the time to do this . - Why not ? Astrid knows everything . I 'm sure Stephen 's , uh , paranormal girlfriend does , too . Luca ? Enough . It 's all right . I know this is ... weird . And my apologies to those of you who aren 't family , uh ... I 'm as disoriented as any of you . But I 'm also very , very happy . No , happy ... doesn 't even begin to describe it , I ... am overwhelmed with love , and gratitude for the three of you . You 're my world . You 're my reason for being . And , I ... am humbled to be back in this home . Let 's all raise our glasses . Here 's to family . To family . Not to complain , per se , but some of us are kind of wondering where the hell Roger is . He 's been away from his family for years , he needs time with them . - He 'll be back soon . - When ? What 's the plan ? I mean , we wait for him all these years and then he just bails on us ? What kind of savior is that ? Hey , let 's not get all Lord of the Flies here , people . - It 's all good . - If you say so . Thanks . It is so not all good . Clearly . Mmm , well , I hope you all saved some room for dessert . Oh , let me give you a hand . Okay . Wow , first time he 's done that in ten years . What do you say we get a little fresh air ? Yeah . Pardon us . Nice night . Listen , Hillary , this better be for real . Stephen is my best friend and he 's a very special guy ... - I 'm aware . - I 'm still talking . He 's got a lot going on right now , and he needs someone he can trust and rely on , and if that happens to be you ... Then great . - But if it 's not ... - I 'm in love with him . Does that answer your question ? Excuse me . So , Hillary . She seems like a nice girl . Yeah , she is . When were you gonna tell me you were leaving again ? It 's only a matter of time before the Founder finds out I 'm back . So , what , you 're gonna run ? Strategic retreat . If he forces me into that machine , those people inside are all in danger . So now what ? Smile . Enjoy the time we have . And be the man who I 'm so damn proud to call my son . I know this is not what you had planned . But everything I 'm doing , everything I 've done , has been to keep this family safe . Eyes on the target . Do we have a green light for extraction , Agent Cole ? Let 's go back inside , before your mom sends out a search party ... Are you reading me , Agent Cole ? Are we a go for extraction team ? Negative , we missed our window . We 'll get him later . Hey , what 's up , Charlie ? People are losing it in the Lair . Talking about leaving , going out on their own . Why are they so unhappy ? I love it down here . I know you do , Charlie . Well , the man they thought was gonna lead them just left . I guess they feel a little lost . But you and Cara are leaders now . Roger was the one ... they thought was gonna come back and save them from this life . And now that he 's left them all over again ... They only believed in Roger because you did . You 're my hero , John . I think you 've had enough . That was for you . Oh , awfully nice of you . Know what would 've been nicer ? If you 'd been there when I came back from the dead . Man . Six years though , Roger , I just couldn 't look you in the eye . It 's not your fault . I really wanted to bring you back sooner . But you didn 't have the means . - I 'm letting you off the hook here , Jed . - Ah , don 't do that . The truth of the matter was , while you were gone , I was the powerful brother for once , and ... I liked it . I know that 's a horrible thing to admit . I knew what I was getting into . I knew I was looking at a one-way trip . Thanks for looking after my family . Thanks for bringing me back to ' em . As short as it was . You 're going underground . As long as I 'm around , the Founder has a terrible weapon . No , you can 't run away now . The Founder is grooming Stephen to take your place . No , he 's just a boy . Do I have to give you a refresher course in genetics ? Our friend has beta-tested your son in the Machine . - Did it work ? - I don 't know . - Is it armed ? - I don 't know . I ... I 've been in exile from Ultra . There 's one way to find out . Still going for a minimalist vibe ? No girlfriend , no pets . Please tell me you picked up a hobby . I 've been a tad busy , Rog . Come on , Alice . Hello , Jed . What a nice surprise . Oh , you 're dating a computer . I should 've guessed . Yeah , you got me . Hi , Alice , can you initiate Protocol 1-3-5-9 , please ? Why does it feel like we 're being naughty ? Well , it 's because we are . Wouldn 't want the Founder secretly spying on us , now would we ? Now , I want all the field data pertaining to this project . Your partner 's so-called Machine ? We 're not partners anymore , love . Downloading it to your drive now . That does feel naughty . Thank you , love . I suppose I shouldn 't share this either , but agents have been dispatched . - We gotta go . - No , we 're not done yet . - Jed , we gotta go . - We 're not done yet . - We need your help . - Actually , we need Tim 's help . I know you 're upset with me , John , but please , do it for Stephen . What is it ? If we 're lucky , it 's nothing . You better get Stephen . It 's the first time I used the Machine . When I realized it could take me to you . Who are they ? Test subjects . What you 're looking at now is footage from an Ultra facility reserved for ... " sensitive experiments . " Those two rooms are connected remotely . The one in white , he 's not moving . - What 's wrong with him ? - He 's human . The other one 's like you . Only far more cruel . Wait , um ... I did that ? No , paranormals can 't kill . It 's not murder if the human isn 't alive . That 's the consequence of you stopping time . What you just saw was a fraction of what the machine 'll do at full power with me in it . Or you . I 'm sorry , Stephen . Looks like you take after me after all . See , first , you failed to apprehend Roger when he was in your sights ... And now it appears there 's been a break-in , at Jedikiah 's former home , where someone has accessed our intranet . Not sure I heard the question . Well , I wonder ... whether your emotions haven 't compromised you , Agent Cole . My emotions . Hmm . I was on my way to deliver new intel , but if you feel as though I should be taken off the mission ... What exactly did you find ? Roger knows that you rebuilt the Machine and that you want him in it . He was speaking to Stephen as though he was saying goodbye , possibly skipping town . Well , if he knows all that then we 're not dealing with a man who 's running away . He 'll be coming right at us . - Uh , what is that ? - Supplies . Mind giving us a heads-up on what the plan is ? I 'm going into Ultra , and sabotaging the Founder 's secret project . 'Cause that worked so well last time . Well , I did destroy the Machine . And yourself , your family . And us . I know what I did to you . I 'm sorry . But there 's no other way . There 's too much at stake . Dad , the Founder wants you in the Machine , you can 't go anywhere near it . It is bound to me . This is a piece of it . It 's tied to my DNA , it 's inside of it . Which means no one else can get near it without triggering the alarm . - I 'm coming with you . - You can help get me in , and that 's it . If I teleport , they 'll detect me . I 'm pretty sure they 'll detect an explosion , then they 'll fire up every D-chip in Ultra . Meaning you 'll have to hoof your way out . So , wait ... Roger came back , and now we 're blowing up our ticket to the Refuge ? I 'm sorry , isn 't that what we 've been waiting for all this time ? The plan has changed . Something awful happens to humans when the Machine is turned on . Who cares ? We 've been offered a truce . Russell went inside Ultra and lived to tell the tale , so why can 't we ? Natalie , we need to stay unified . In this gutter ? While our leader is off starting yet another fight with the Founder ? I don 't know about you guys , but I would rather be unified in the Refuge . There is no Refuge . No promised land . This is the only world there is . But the Founder wants to use the Machine to kill every man , woman and child on the planet . Every human man , woman and child . I 'm sorry . I can 't let that happen . Well , you can 't keep me here , either . I 'm going topside . I 'm gonna make my own peace with Ultra before his father , our absentee messiah , blows everything to hell . Who 's coming with me ? If they turn themselves in to Ultra ... I know , they could give us up , and my dad 's plan . Well , it looks like that plan just got moved up . Fine , I will keep an eye on them . Make sure they don 't do anything dumb ... er . Hey . Hey . I hope it wasn 't too awkward , me crashing your family reunion . Uh , no , it was really awkward . Great . But not because of you . That part was kind of nice . Uh , what 's going on ? Um ... I don 't know . Hey ! What is it ? Look , it 's supposed to be classified . And you don 't trust me ? The Machine is being relocated . Why ? Because the Founder 's afraid . Of what ? Jedikiah . He thinks he wants to destroy it . Hillary , you didn 't tell him about my father , did you ? No , of course not . Do you know where he 's taking it ? Dad , it 's a black site near the port . The plan is to move the Machine on a barge somewhere . We have to intercept it . I 'll meet you there . I 'm gonna need you to shut down the perimeter , and then get out . Got it . You just got home . All I want is to lie in bed with you . And shoot hoops with my boys . But this won 't wait . I know . I 'm not so naive to think things would be normal with you coming back . We were never normal . Maybe if I 'd embraced that fact from the beginning ... No . You did everything right . Everything good about this family is you . That reckless kid out there trying to ... save the world . He takes after me . After us . I should talk to Luca . It 's okay . I 'll explain . And you 'll be back . Okay . I got you , Dad . D-chips are down . Coast looks clear . What are you doing , John ? I 'm sorry , Roger . You have no idea what I 've been through . Six years of lying to our people . Keeping them alive on the hope that one day you 'd return to save them . I never meant to hurt you , John . I 'm not gonna let you do this . You can 't access the Machine without me . I already have you . Go home , Roger . Be the leader I promised you 'd be . John . Please don 't do this . Dad , where are you ? I lost you . John ? Get him out of here now . What did you do ? He 's fine , but in 30 seconds when I blow up this Machine , all hell 's gonna break loose . Stop ! You can 't go down there . - What are you doing here ? - I am saving you from making a mistake and getting taken down with your dad . What ? He is a terrorist , it 's too late for him , but it 's not too late for you . The Founder will still forgive you . No . John , it 's a trap . Stephen , they can 't hear you . The D-chips are back up . How could you ? I care about you , I am doing this to protect you . You have no idea what you 've done . He wants him alive . Come on . Wakey-wakey . Not the man I was expecting to open that door . Where is Roger ? I don 't know . Under the circumstances , I 'd advise you not to lie to me . If you want to kill innocent people , you better find someone else to put in your Machine . Now , there are no innocent people . People would turn you inside out , given half the chance . Dissecting your body to reveal its secrets . Jealous of your god-given gifts . People like Jedikiah . The man who turned you into a freak ! See , I 'm trying to forge a world in which you can rise out of your sewer a free man ! With the woman you love . And the life you deserve . I 'd rather die than give up Roger . You see , you 're the only one who can kill , John . You 're the only one . But since you 're so keen on mankind ... Perhaps you 'd like to join them . This is your last chance . Where is he ? You leave me no choice . Hit him . Again . Again ! They all go eventually . Sign me up , this place is amazing ! Yeah , it 's like Steve Jobs redid the Death Star . Look , how do we know that they won 't give us the serum that takes our powers ? Ultra 's not exactly known for honesty . Right , ' cause Roger kept his promise . Thank you for your patience . Welcome to Ultra . It 's nice to see you again , Russell . Oh , hey . I assume you 're all here for the tracer . I know it seems scary ... But honestly ? The process is no more painful than a flu shot . Who would like to go first ? You ? You must have read my mind . Uh , maybe we should talk about this ? It 's her first time at Ultra . This place is lined with D-chips . If something goes down , we can 't even call for help . So what exactly does that shot do ? It allows us to keep track of our kind , in the event of an emergency . Besides , you don 't want to get lost when we finally make our way to the Refuge , now do you ? - I 'm in . - No . I 'll go first . If this goes gnarly , I want you to take the others and get the hell out of here , you got that ? Hold still . See ? That wasn 't so bad . Who 's next ? Can I sit ? Suit yourself . What is it ? I really messed up , Astrid . And I know that you never trusted me . And you were right not to . But , it wasn 't about Stephen . I really do love him . Why are you telling me ? Because ... I need you to do me a favor . I just want to make things right with him . I need you to call me at this number in one hour . Can you do that ? Why ? It 's the only way to help them . Help all of them . Just please say that you 'll do it . Okay . I 'll call . One hour . On the dot . If you 're gonna have me killed ... just do it already . Oh , no , John , why would I want to do that ? No , I 've got a job for you . You 're going to deliver a message for me . So , how long do we have to stay here ? Just until you and Luca are safe . Sorry , Mom . Dad ! Hey , buddy . You 're okay ? I need a minute with your brother . Luca , let me show you around . Dad , we 're back at war , the Founder knows everything . And he 's gonna come after us . And unless we take him out , he 's going after every human being on the planet . Then you are clearly going to need me . With the Machine still operational , the Founder more dangerous than ever ? Then it 's a good thing we 're together . Yeah . John , do you hear me ? John ? I am so sorry , Stephen . You will never know how sorry I am . Hillary , you used me , you betrayed me , you ... I loved you . Goodbye , Stephen . Wait . Hillary ? Sir ? Do you have a moment ? For you , Agent Cole ? We 're quite well positioned , thanks to you . Not exactly as I 'd anticipated , but well positioned nonetheless . We sold out our entire species . And I sold out Stephen . Really ? Well , I 'd never imagined your girlish interior life . It 's ... charming . But Agent Cole , we 've sold out no one . We are merely protecting Stephen and his fellow rebels from themselves . I assure you , the end we are fast approaching is to the benefit of all our kind . And the humans ? Whatever fate they meet , they brought upon themselves . My whole life I wanted to be a hero . I have finally found a way . Meaning ? It 's time for you to die . Well , if only our kind could kill . It 's our most refined quality . Could someone please come in here and escort Agent Cole to ... I 'm not gonna kill you . It 's for you .

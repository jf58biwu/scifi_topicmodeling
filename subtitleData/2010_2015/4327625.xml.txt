 You 're taking a vacation from normalcy . The setting , a weird motel where the bed is stained with mystery , and there 's also some mystery floating in the pool . Your key card may not open the exercise room because someone smeared mystery on the lock . But it will open the Scary Door . Submitted for your Emmy consideration , a popular senator with unpopular ideas . There is no such thing as space aliens ! Oh ! How can you be so sure them aliens ain 't already among us ? I 'll tell you how ! Because you are one ! Hey , I was watching that ! The Saints just needed a field goal to tie ! Lrrr , you lazy ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8 ! You said you would conquer a planet today , but you have not even shed your skin yet . Yes , Ndnd . I heard you the first hundred times . I 'll conquer something tomorrow after I fuel up on one of your disgusting egg-white omelets . You want yolks ? Fine ! Enjoy your stroke . I am conquering Erth ! Not so fast , Invader X ! Here comes Delivery-Boy Man ! Special deliver for Invader X ! Laser eye power ! Hand magnet power ! Yay ! I 'm unbuckled ! Stop it , you hero ! Reverse-time power ! It 's earlier now . So ? What do you think of my comic ? Let me put it like this . After I leave here , I 'm getting a memory enema . If I might offer some constructive criticism , there was never any real peril . I mean , the delivery guy has , like , 30 superpowers . Well , that 's because he was bitten by a radioactive superman ! - This is wonderful ! - It is , isn 't it ? Wait , those are the ads . These X-ray specs will really take the guesswork out of surgery . No more chopping blindly in the goop . Don 't waste your allowance , Zoidberg . This stuff is butt-grade crap . Amuse your friends with real vomit ! Throw your voice ! Sea monkeys ! Throw your sea monkeys ! My disintegrator ray really works ! - But that 's you . - That 's how I know it 's bunkum . The Farnsworth Novelty Disintegrator Ray is nothing more than a common teleporter ray . Worthless toy ! I 'm sick of being critiqued by nitpicking nerds . I 'm taking this to a comic book convention ! It 's crowded ! Good thing everyone is freshly bathed and groomed . Oooh ! What are you doing ? That 's the rare Zapp Brannigan with recording session blooper ! Don 't tell me how to do the line . It sickens me . But the sign said there was a mint in the box . Thank you so ... Okay , thanks . Thanks so ... Settle down ! So , anyway , we 're really excited to show you guys the pilot for our new series . It 's set in the year 4000 , and we call it Futurella ! Wow . Fox has really streamlined the process . Matt will now take questions . But please , only about Futurella , not The Simpsons . Yes ? The robot standing on the small child over there ? Yeah , when are you going to make a second Simpsons movie ? Mr. Aragonés , I 'm a big fan of your cartoons and your mustache . You want it ? Take it . It 's brought me nothing but misery . Wow . Thanks ! If you could just quiet down , I wanted to get your opinion of my comic book . Señor , anyone who still writes comics is a hero to me . Mmm . It stinks . But , um , I do like the tiny doodles in the margins . Oh , that 's just some relish from a hot dog I found . Attention , ladies and gentleboys , the costume contest is about to begin . The costume contest ! The costume contest ! Yeah ! Devo ! What the hell are you supposed to be ? Every nerd 's fantasy , baby . Next up , contestant number 36 ! Contestant 36 , everyone ! Next up , contestant ... I am Lrrr , ruler of the planet ... Hold on a second , let me just get this . I am Lrrr , ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8 . You are hereby conquered ! Please line up in order of how much beryllium it takes to kill you ! Damn , that 's a good costume . Next up , contestant 38 ! I don 't understand . Why are the humans still eating their soft pretzels instead of surrendering ? They 're probably just waiting for Joss Whedon . Joss Whedon 's here ? Wait a minute . You look familiar . Yeah , you almost ate me once . I was in your mouth for five minutes . Leela ? And the winner is Nerdgasma ! Whoo ! I got fruit boobs ! What 's the use ? Now what ? I send you out to conquer a planet , and all you bring back is J.J. Abrams ' face ? I thought you 'd like it . You haven 't even tried it on . I might dress up in a face if you ever took me anywhere nice ! Oh , boy , here we go . I built this castle with my own two slaves ! What are you gonna do , kick me out ? I am Lrrr , ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8 ! May I crash on your couch ? So he just showed up unannounced , raided the liquor cabinet , sprayed urine on the ceiling and passed out ? And the walls . Leave me alone . My wife hates me and planetary conquest has become a chore . There , there . You 're just having a midlife crisis . Midlife crisis , eh ? Lrrr demands the comfort of pop-psychological platitudes ! Look , hoss , your wife threw you out . That 's your license to be a jerk . Do whatever the hell you want , then walk away and light a cigar . Don 't listen to him , Lrrr . Bender may seem happy But long-term , you need to reinvest in your relationship with Ndnd . Yes , it 's clear what I must do . I like it . I 'm thinking we need to downplay those hideous growths on your head . Horns are a sign of virility . Also , they house my testes . I 'm thinking horn extensions . You need some arm candy . It 's the perfect accessory for out-of-shape middle-aged creeps like you . Yeah , I said it ! What 's your type , Borgnine ? Big and angry . Look , brah , you 're just not gonna find a lot of hot , gigantic Omicronian babes in this solar system . There 's one ! - Hey , cool cape . Where 'd you get that ? - What , this old thing ? I murdered my father . My name 's Lrrr , ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8 . - I am called Grrl . - Of the planet Omicron Persei 8 ? That is a pretty name ! What 's on the TV tonight ? Oh , wait ! I don 't care , because I got a date ! I know it 's not what you want to hear , but I think this is a mistake . Leela 's right . That 's not what you want to hear . What you want to hear is that I fixed my comic book . Now the hero is more relatable because he has no ridiculous powers . Let 's watch , shall we ? One more step and little Miss Constructive Criticism here gets it ! Oh , yeah ? I may be just a simple delivery boy with no superpowers , so there 's nothing I can do . Okay . So ? Give me your honest praise . Fry , I 've now seen two comic books , so listen to me . Why should I care about the hero when all he does is cry ? Hmm . That dinner was a worthy foe . Yes , we shall not see its like again . So , um ... Um , I 'm sorry . I haven 't done this for a while . I just got partway out of a bad relationship . Maybe I should take this off . - You 're a human ? - Only physically . I 'm a cross-species dresser . Wait , you 're an actual Omicronian ? Oh , God . Oh , God , what have I done ? This is so hot ! Conquer me , Lrrr ! Sharpen your horns on my scaly thorax ! I want to go home ! But Ndnd would never take me back now . Ndnd just wants what every she-beast wants , to feel like you 're listening to her nagging . Is there anything she 's been riding your ass about ? Conquering things , I guess . I could conquer Earth , kill all humans . - That 's a thought . - No ! We don 't need a war of the worlds . That 's it ! We need a war of the worlds ! I 'll call Orson Welles . Dork calling Orson ! Dork calling Orson ! You 're asking me , the renowned spokesman for Paul Masson wine , to recreate my brilliant 1938 radio broadcast merely to deceive and impress the wife of this skinny reptile ? - Sorry . Never mind . - I 'll do it for free . Ladies and gentlemen , we interrupt our program of The Jonas Brothers and their orchestra to bring you a special bulletin . We interrupt our program of The Jonas brothers and their orchestra to bring you a special bulletin . I 'm speaking to you from the hickory farms in Grover 's Mall , New Jersey , through a mouthful of summer sausage , mmm , where I hardly know where to begin . Mmm ! A huge spacecraft , piloted by a devastatingly handsome ... Now , how in God 's name do I know what the fellow looks like if he 's inside a ship miles in the air ? It 's just foolish on its face . If you want the cheese log , you 'll read what I wrote . Very well . I shall comply . I 'm getting reports that cities across the globe are being destroyed by this noble invader , whose good looks are apparently discernible across vast distances and through solid metal . But wait , the leader of the attack is swaggering out of his ship and up to a convenient nearby microphone . Now , why couldn 't I have just described his appearance at this point ? This is the type of thing I 'm talking about . People of Earth , I am Lrrr , conqueror of your planet . Cue screams . You will now remove your skulls and play dodgeball with them for my amusement ! Ooh ! I could swear his horns have gotten longer ! Sir , I 've intercepted an Earth broadcast . Put it up on the Zenith . Oh , God ! Earth is conquered , the destruction of civilization complete . Now stay tuned for Little Orphan Annie . To hell with Little Orphan Annie ! We 've got to do something . What 's that , honey ? How many dead ? I don 't know , 80 million ? Okay . I love you , too . That was Ndnd . She 's taking me back ! I 'm sorry I 've been so difficult . So , you thought you could conquer us so easily , eh ? Nice job . We surrender . Earth is yours . Damn , I 'm good . Now , may I please have that cheese log ? O glorious conqueror , permit me to offer up a sacrifice . How about this ? Hey ! - Yeah , he 'll do . - Come on , Lrrr . Show 's over . Fine , okay . About this conquering thing , Funny story ... Hello , Lrrr . Lrrr ! Put a stop to this right now ! Okay ! Okay ! Quit nagging ! Lrrr , why are you yelling softly with the purple-furred one ? Uh , it 's nothing , my queen . - He messed up my hair . - I 'm missing a leg ! We fought like hell , sir , but in the end , we caved like a house of soufflé cards . Got it . Peace with honor . Well , I resign again . Come , Nixon . Introduce me to the kitchen staff . I must lay down the law about Lrrr 's low-sodium diet . You 've got to tell her the truth . And lay off the salted peanuts ! I 'm just trying to get the leg taste out of my mouth . Lrrr ! I 'm in here now , not out there ! Give me a little time . With a lady like Ndnd , one must use finesse . Coming , gigantums ! Mmm . That 's crisp . Yes , but no more so than your squamous dorsal plates in the moonlight . I am experiencing arousal . My organs are moving into position . Ndnd , there 's something I 've got to tell you . What is it ? Is there someone else ? What ? No , no , it 's about this takeover of Earth . - It 's ... It 's ... - The spark that reignited our marriage ? Yes ! Exactly . Good night . Oh , lord . Now what ? I couldn 't tell her the truth . Look , you scaly crybaby , you do what I say and you do it now ! I knew it ! Frying pans ! Cast-iron frying pans ! It 's not what it looks like ! - What do I do ? - Do what I say . - Tell her ! - Tell me what ? Give me the heavy one . The invasion was all a fake . I just wanted to impress you . You lied ? What else have you been hiding from me ? What else ? Nothing else . I still want you , Lrrr , and I 'm willing to fight for you . All I got left is a colander and a pie pan . Lrrr ? Look , we only had one date . I barely mated with her . Whatever . I harbor no resentment against her . What I want to know is what is up between you and Bossy Boots here . - Her ? She 's just a bossy friend . - Exactly ! She nagged you , tormented you and pushed you around . That is my job ! This must be settled . I demand the ancient ritual of Rrrmrrrmrrrfrrrmrrr or Consequences ! Rrrmrrrmrrrfrrrmrrr or what ? Let the ritual begin ! The rules are the same as in the home version . Lrrr must simply choose between myself and Leela ... Fine . Hurry up . ... by shooting the one he rejects . Lrrr , I 'm getting angry . Don 't you go through with this . She is not the boss of you ! I am the boss of you ! Um ... Oh ... Leela 's going to die ! What would Delivery-Boy Man do ? I do not want to shoot anybody . - You never want to do anything ! - Oh , nag , nag , nag . You want me to stop nagging ? Then shoot me ! - Oh , you 'd like that , wouldn 't you ? - Beats staring at your fat ass on the couch ! Oh , yeah ? I 'll show you ! Ray-blocking power ! Fry ! Lrrr ! You were willing to shoot that bossy temptress ! You really do value my nagging above all others ! Good night , dumb prince . Come back , Lrrr ! I want to have your popplers ! There 'll never be anyone but you ! - Hello . - Of course I 'll marry you . Wait , what the shmell happened ? I thought Ndnd disintegrated you with this ray gun . It 's just a cheap teleporter . I bought it out of the back of a comic book . Cha-ching ! The teleporter gun ? That means Fry might still be ... - Fry ! - Fry ? Is this him ? Fry ! You 're alive ! Not only that , I now know exactly how to end my comic book . Let 's watch . Say good-bye to your forehead , because I 'm going to shoot you in it ! Not if I leap in front of your death ray , and I am going to do that . Jumping sound ! Ow ! I didn 't shoot yet . As usual , your delivery arrived too soon . Oh , Delivery-Boy Man ! You saved me by random chance ! Don 't thank random chance . Thank my meteor-wishing power , with your lips . Good ending . Not great . ENGLISH - US - SDH

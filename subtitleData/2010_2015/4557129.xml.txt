 13 Bannerman Road is where Sarah Jane Smith lives ! It 's home to things way beyond your imagination . There 's an extra-terrestrial super computer in the wall . Her son , a genetically-engineered boy genius . A schoolgirl investigator across the road . And a whole universe of adventure , right here on the doorstep . Ready ? Always . My name 's Sarah Jane Smith , I 'm not an amateur , and I don 't think you are either . I don 't care what you think . What 's happening is you 're not in charge any more . 'I am sorry . You are very ill indeed . ' You 've got your secret attic , welcome to my secret cellar . Yes , you ARE ill ! I made you ill . Your life essence is delicious . And you 're just the starter . Once it 's consumed you , it 'll be big enough to absorb many more life essences . Many , many souls at a time . How ? What are you going to do ? Well , I 'm going to carry on your work . Well , with one big difference - I 'll still be tracking aliens from the attic , yes , but , um ... I 'm going to help them . Help them ? How ? Anyway they like . They want all the water ? Go ahead , drink up . Mineral wealth ? Thataway . Colonise ? Well , pick a continent . You 'll destroy the planet . Eventually , yes . But what an exciting time humanity will have . No ! CHAINS RATTLE And I will feed on every drop ... of their terror and despair . I 'll get my hair done like Lady Gaga , all skewiff , then dye it streaked . No way ! This is a wind-up . I know one when I hear one . SHE LAUGHS Oh , the door 's open again . Oi , I 'm serious ... Sarah Jane , tell Rani she 's .. Oh , sorry , Rubes . Where 's Sarah Jane ? Play . 'I want you to listen . Please don 't start shouting . 'Most important , don 't take it out on Ruby . ' What 's this ? 'I nearly got you killed . 'You aren 't safe with me any longer . ' What ? No ! No , oh , please , no . 'This life is exciting and wonderful . 'But it changes you , and it 's hard . We have a responsibility , all of us . 'The biggest responsibility is knowing when to stop . 'So I 'm stopping . I 've gone . ' What ? Gone where ? 'Ruby is talking my place . She needs your full trust and support , 'and I know you 'll be mature enough to give that to her . 'Please don 't try and find me . You 've been incredible . 'Clyde , Rani , and Ruby defending the Earth from an attic in Ealing . 'What could be better ? 'Goodbye . ' That isn 't me ! That isn 't me ! You knew about this and didn 't tell us ? ! No , Clyde , no ! You heard what Sarah Jane said . She wouldn 't go and not tell us ! I tried to talk to her , but she wouldn 't listen . I 'm sorry ! It 's not your fault , Ruby . Luke 'll know where she 's gone . No , she didn 't tell him . She knew he would talk her out of it . Luke doesn 't know ? ! I don 't know what to say . Just shut up ! Clyde ! I 've just got to talk to him . Oh ... SHE SNIFFS I 'm almost upsetting myself . Enjoying the show ? They 'll find a way to stop you . Aw ... The hope of the dying tastes so sweet . You 've got to get this message , you 've got to help ! Clyde ? Are you OK ? You and your stupid " holiday " , you put this in her head ! Now she 's gone , like my dad 's gone , and it 's all your fault ! But ... . Just stay away from me ! Oh ! Sweetheart ... Rani ? Whatever 's the matter ? It 's Sarah Jane . She 's gone . She 's moved away . What ? I only saw her yesterday . Well , are you sure , my love ? She 's gone , Mum . And she just left a message with Ruby . What ? Moonlight flit ? That 's not her style . She didn 't even tell Luke . Well , now I know this is rubbish . Luke 's her son . The way Sarah Jane looks at Luke ... Well , it 's the same way I look at you . A mother knows . I see you two , having a laugh , sharing your big secret . Don 't think I 've not noticed . You and her , you have something special . Sometimes , I get a bit jealous . Mum , don 't say that . But Sarah Jane makes you happy , and that makes me happy . You listen to me , Rani Chandra . She would never , ever just run off . Where 's Ruby ? ' Clyde . ' Tell me . 'I ... I cannot comply ... 'Clyde , I ... ' Doesn 't matter . Find Sarah Jane . I 'm going after her . Mr Smith ? ! ' Letter 2 . ' What does that mean ? 'Letter 2 . ' What , like the alphabet ? The letter B ? 'Letter 5 . 'Letter 23 . ' B ... E ... W ... Beware ! Beware what ? ! Clyde , are you OK ? I was worried . What you said before ... Forget it , we 've got to find Sarah Jane . She doesn 't want us to find her . 'Letter 18 ... 18 . ' What was that ? Mr Smith ? What 's the matter with you ? 'There 's nothing wrong . A minor malfunction , now rectified . ' He was trying to tell me something . Beware and then letter 18 . What 's letter 18 in the alphabet ? Huh ? ! That 's R ! For Ruby ... Mr Smith was trying to warn me it 's you . You 've done this ! You made Sarah Jane go . Clyde ... We could 've had so much fun together , but I can 't have you running to Rani and I 've heard enough from the zylot . Shut him down , Mr White ! 'With pleasure . ' No ! Mr Smith ! No ! Mr Smith ! Oh , get off me ! Where is this ? Take a look . Recognise it ? I think that bit 's Finland . This was my prison . My people exiled me . We have a ... A hunger . Mine was too strong . They trapped me here for eternity with only a game system for company . Only now it 's my ship . This golf ball ? Well , I reprogrammed the games device . It took me a while . A long while . Mr White ? He 's a PlayStation ? He 's taken me to so many places . But don 't go looking for them . They 're sadly no longer with us . But Sarah Jane scanned you ... Ah , this has a biodamper . It screened me . Belonged to a previous friend , God rest her soul . Where 's Sarah Jane ? Ooh ! She 's watching us right now . I was going to feed off you , Clyde . I wanted your love , your dependence , your hope . And then your despair . You can 't ! Leave him alone . RUMBLING RUBY : ' Now this ship will be your prison , too . ' No ! But only for a little while . We 've only got the air we came in with and ... I don 't need it . Goodbye , Clyde . No ! No , Ruby ! VOICE ECHOES Come on , Clyde , pick up ! ' The number you dialled is not available . 'Please try again ... ' DOORBELL RINGS Clyde ! What the hell 's going on ? Suddenly Clyde leaves me a message . I rush down here and Mum 's gone ! What did you do ? I trusted you . So it 's my fault again ! You and Clyde must 've done something ... You 're the one who left her ! 'Mistress ! ' Immediate cessation . Stop arguing . We must locate Mistress Sarah Jane . Co-operation between all units essential . Sorry , Rani . Where 's Clyde ? We need him . K9 , can you track Clyde 's phone , tell me where he is ? Attempting to contact mobile now . We 'll get him round , Mum and Dad will be gone for hours . Phone out of communication range . However , transponder locators indicate Victus 471.3 231.4 . That 's impossible , recalculate . Calculation confirmed . What 's the matter ? The coordinates - that 's space . He 's in orbit . Help ! VOICE ECHOES HE PANTS We have to get to the attic , we need Mr Smith . Wait ! Both of you try this . Today , Sarah Jane runs away without saying a word . Ruby takes over and Clyde is now in space . What are the chances of that ? 0.1 % . Which means it 's not by chance . Which means it 's Ruby . And I believed her . Ruby ! She 's got Mum and Clyde . And my mum saw it , we didn 't . None of us . Have you still got that photo of Ruby and Mr White ? Here . K9 , scan it . Affirmative , Master Luke . Scan reveals technology of Mr White unit is of Qetesh origin . What 's a Qetesh ? They are called Soul Stealers . Skilled in manipulation , they create heightened emotional states in their victims and drain their life essence . Ruby 's a Qetesh ! Mum wasn 't ill , Ruby was feeding from her ! Oh , Luke , I am so sorry . She tricked you all , it 's not your fault . Alert ! Image does not show entirety of Qetesh entity . The human part is just the mouth . Qetesh stomach must be nearby . The stomach ? ! Oh , my God ! Sarah Jane ! No ... RUBY LAUGHS 'Oh ... ' I can feel Sarah Jane Smith fading away . MR WHITE : ' On schedule . ' Not long now . Rani , get out of my way . You run in there and she will kill you . We need to think , you taught me to think , use logic ! Logic ? Mr Smith should have seen this ! Inferior Smith was dominated by Qetesh " Mr White " unit . Typical . Well , can we get him back on our side ? Scans reveal that Mr White unit is a modified and corrupted holographic entertainment system . Of course . 5D holograms ! Rani , there never was a meteor or an invasion , it was all special effects . Also , Mr White unit must control a teleport link . Which is how Clyde 's got up there . Correct . So , Mr White , he 's just a games console ? ! But massively upgraded . Can you wipe him , get rid of the upgrades ? Reset him . See ? Logic ! I can transmit a reset codec . I can then assume control , release Mr Smith and rescue Master Clyde . Then do it , now ! Regret . I will need direct access to transmit signal . Oh , no ! No . Wait . K9 , if we get this close to Mr White , can you send the signal that way ? Affirmative . Caution , audio relay not ideal , it will take some minutes to complete reset . Some minutes . How many 's some ? Doesn 't matter , let 's go . Stop ! She 'll know something 's up if you walk in there ! You can 't ... It 's the only way , or Clyde and Sarah Jane will die . Rani , Sarah Jane , Luke ... My time 's almost up . It 'll soon be over . But you 'll find the phone . Sarah Jane , you 're the best . Don 't ever beat yourself up about this , OK ? I 've had the best time . And tell Mum I had to go away , tell her I 'm sorry ... And Luke ? Best mates , forever , yeah ? Rani ... you 're brilliant . I always ... I always ... Rani . How 's Clyde ? How 's everything ? Clyde 's not good with his emotions . You know what blokes are like . Come here , Ruby , I need a hug . Oh ! I thought you 'd blame me . I 'd never blame you . You know we 'll always be mates . Clyde 's just a bit touchy , cos of his dad . Look ... I could do with a girly chat , though . Oh , OK . How are you holding up ? It must be really hard on you . Oh , the shock of it . She just sprang it on me last night , I 've hardly slept . And I bet she didn 't give you much choice . You know Sarah Jane . I keep hoping she 'll suddenly walk through the door , but ... if it really is me in charge , then , um ... I 'm going to need you , Rani . Oh , Ruby ... Oh ! Oh , come on . There , there , it 'll be all right . You and me ... And Clyde . And Clyde ... of course . There 's something else . I can say it , now she 's gone . Don 't tell Clyde . I prefer you to Sarah Jane . You 're going to be so much more fun . With Sarah Jane , it was just rules , rules , rules ! Don 't wander off , do your homework . You know , to be honest , it 's a relief she 's gone . Oh , Rani . That 's so sweet . You shouldn 't say things like that . Because they 're not very convincing ! Agh ! Oh ! Right , I enjoyed you having to do that . Now you 're going to tell me why ! K9 , now , it has to be now ! Contact ! MACHINE STARTS UP 'Contact . 'Factory settings restored . ' Clever ... little girl ! Get Clyde down ! Teleport , now ! Teleportation in ten seconds . Oh , Rani ... Mummy will be so upset . Clyde ! Stay away from her ! I know you 'll never fire that . Course not . I just want you standing there . Mr Smith , Containment Vortex now ! A force field , how quaint . Don 't think this is going to hold me for long . Thank you , thank you , thank you . Rani , I love you . Mr White , my mum , where is she ? 'Your mother 's in the cellar at Number 46 , Old Forest Road . ' Eugh , that must be Ruby 's stomach . Mum ! Her what ? My stomach ! 'Vortex compromised . ' Better start running . 'Vortex compromised ! ' Get over there , I 'll deal with her . Luke Smith , you really are your mother 's son . But it changes nothing . She 's finished ! Clyde and Rani are next , and then I 'm coming for you . 'Containment Vortex critical . ' Mine , I think . BUZZ ! Agh ! No chance ! Give it up , now ! 'I have blocked all teleport transmissions . ' Well , I can still use my legs . My power is growing and soon no-one on this planet will be safe from me ! Mr Smith , what she said ! Her power 's growing , so it 's not ready yet . 'I do not understand you , Luke . ' Both of you , give me everything you 've got on Qetesh ! The way they feed , the stomach . Mr White , clear hologram channels for emergency transmission . Sarah Jane ! Get back ! Oh , oh ... I knew ... Oh , I knew you could do it . We 're getting out of here ! I 'm afraid not ! This is where the adventure ends . Yours , not mine . I wouldn 't normally do this , but for you three ... it 'll be a pleasure . Direct absorption of living flesh . FRIGHTENED GASPS Goodbye , Sarah Jane Smith ! Qetesh ! This is your one and only warning . Luke ! Leave this planet now ! SHE LAUGHS And here 's sonny boy . Are you threatening me ? You 're nothing ! Come and join the feast ! Mr White , hologram program now ! Of course Sarah Jane hasn 't run off . Bet Rani 's with her and Langer right now , doing whatever it is they do . Haresh ! Get down ! Agh ! You wanted thrills , Qetesh ? Here they are ! Mr White 's sending out a hologram ! Everyone on Earth is seeing your meteor coming right to them ! Millions of them . He 's giving it everything he 's got ! And you 're giving her what she wants ! But too much ! An emotional surge from six billion people all in one go . It 's overwhelming her . CRIES OF PAIN Feedback from the whole world . Starter , main course , pudding , everything at once . You 've been super-sized ! It 's going to splurge , I know it . It 's going to splurge ! Ah ! Oh , ah ! Agh ! Everything you 've taken from my mum , she 's getting it back ! Thank you , Rani . Hello , Luke . Welcome home ! You aced it , Lukeyboy ! Oh , look . It didn 't splurge ! OK . It did . Ruby ... You made a big mistake coming here . What we do , it isn 't for thrills . It 's not yours to take . Sarah Jane ... I underestimated you . No . You know me inside out . I knew I could rely on Luke and Rani and Clyde . I could always rely on them . But my hunger , I need to feed . I can 't help the way I am . Yeah , but you didn 't have to enjoy it so much . I wish I could help you . But I can 't . What are you going to do to me ? That teleport bracelet , a link to your prison ? Where your people judged you should be . Who am I to question their judgment ? No , no , don 't send me back into the darkness . Please , you understand ! I can 't be alone , you know what that 's like ! Don 't fall for it , Sarah Jane . Oh , Rani ! I wasn 't born yesterday . WATCH BUZZES This isn 't the end . I 'll make you regret this ! You will suffer for this , Sarah Jane Smith ! 'Gravity lock disengaging . ' This world will suffer ! HER VOICE FADES INTO THE DISTANCE Right , Mr White is going straight into the safe . Can 't I keep him ? He 's just a flashy games console now . Nice try . No . No , Mum . I didn 't see anything . Probably just an advert or something . One of those new 3D games . Yeah ! I 'll be home soon , I promise . Bye ! 3D games ? I like that . Get Mr Smith to do a cover story . 'I take it I the combined efforts of myself and K9 were satisfactory ? ' You called him K9 ! 'He 's not so bad after all . 'I 've met worse . It is an equitable arrangement . ' Get a room , boys ! All of you saved me . Every single one of you played a part . Thank you . But don 't think you 're having an easy ride . We 've got a planet to protect . You sure you 're up to it ? Oh , Clyde . With a team like this ? Yeah , I think I can go on forever . CAR HORN BEEPS OUTSIDE Oh , that 's our ride . Ride where ? Pizza , cinema , whatever you like . I think we 've earned one night off . 'Goodbye , Sarah Jane . ' Lukeyboy . 'Yes , there are amazing things up there in the universe . 'But they 've got some very stiff competition down here on Earth .

 Copyright from ecOtOne ™ ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) TRIS : We 're lucky to be in The City . They say the war was terrible , that the rest of the world was destroyed . Our founders built the wall to keep us safe and they divided us into five groups , factions , to keep the peace . The smart ones , the ones who value knowledge and logic are in Erudite . They know everything . ( YELLING INDISTINCTLY ) Amity farm the land . They 're all about kindness and harmony , always happy . Candor value honesty and order . They tell the truth , even when yöu wish they wouldn 't . And then there 's Dauntless . They 're our protectors , our soldiers , our police . I always thought they were amazing . Brave , fearless and free . Some people think Dauntless are crazy , which they kind of are . ( LAUGHING ) MAN : Come on , Beatrice . My faction is Abnegation . The others all call us " stiffs . " We lead a simple life , selfless , dedicated to helping others . We even feed the Factionless , the ones who don 't fit in anywhere . Because we 're public servants , we 're trusted to run the government . My father works alongside our leader , Marcus . It all works . Everyone knows where they belong . Except for me . ( SNIPPING ) My mother says there 's an art to losing yöurself . But I haven 't figured it out yet . I 'm supposed to never think of myself , to always help others . To never look too long in the mirror . Are yöu nervous ? ( INHALES DEEPLY ) No . Were yöu ? For yöur test ? Mmm .. mmm . No . I was terrified . ( CHUCKLES SOFTLY ) But I didn 't have any reason to be and neither do yöu . That 's all yöu get . Rules are rules . TRIS : Today I take the test . I 'm scared it 'll tell me I 'm not Abnegation . That I have to leave my family . But I 'm even more scared that it will tell me to stay . For my brother Caleb , it 's easy . CALEB : Let me help yöu with that . TRIS : He 's a natural . Beatrice , do yöu wanna get the other bags ? Sorry . CALEB : What if she 'd been blind or an amputee ? Would yöu have helped her then ? I was thinking about helping her . CALEB : It 's not that hard . For yöu , maybe . Just relax , Beatrice . Take a deep breath and trust the test . TRIS : Trust the test . Test will tell me who I am , where I belong . Am I smart ? Kind ? Am I honest ? Selfless ? Or brave ? Hey . So , all the food that we 're not getting , yöu guys are giving away to the Factionless ? - Right ? Yeah ? - Yeah . Yöu 're a liar . Why are yöu lying to me ? Everybody knows yöu keep it for yöurselves . So why don 't yöu just admit it ? Huh ? I 'm talking to yöu . Are all yöu stiffs deaf or somethin ' ? Hey ! Beatrice ... Don 't . ( SIGHS ) ( TRAIN APPROACHING ) ( SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ) One hundred years ago , after the war , our founders created a system they believed would prevent future conflict and create lasting peace . Today , aptitude testing based on yöur personality will assign yöu to one of the factions . While it is our belief that choosing the faction indicated by yöur test is the best way to ensure success within the faction system , it is yöur right tomorrow at the choosing ceremony to choose any of the five factions , regardless of yöur test results . However , once the choice has been made , there will be no change permitted . ( WOMAN ON PA SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ) What is it with yöu Abnegation and mirrors ? We reject vanity . Yeah . I know . Sit down . I 'm Tori . I 'll be administering yöur test . Yöu 'll be offered a series of choices to test yöur aptitude for each faction until yöu get one result . I wouldn 't sweat it . 95 % get the faction of their origin , and from the looks of yöu ... What is it ? Bottoms up . ( SNIFFS ) ( SIGHS ) Choose . Now . Before it 's too late . Why ? What Will I do with them ? Choose . Just tell me . ( DOG BARKS ) ( GASPS ) ( DOG SNARLING ) ( DOG WHINING ) LITTLE GIRL : Puppy ! ( SNARLING ) ( BARKING ) ( GASPS ) Get up . We 're going out the back door before a supervisor comes . - But what was my result ? - Come on ! What happened ? Yöu 're going to tell yöur family that the serum made yöu sick and that I sent yöu home . All right ? No , but what was my result ? Abnegation . And Erudite . And Dauntless . Dauntless ... Yöur results were inconclusive . That 's impossible . It doesn 't make any sense . No . Not impossible . It 's just extremely rare . They call it " Divergent . " Yöu can 't tell anyone about this . Not even yöur parents . As far as the world is concerned , yöu received an Abnegation result because that is what I manually entered . So what am I supposed to do at the choosing ceremony ? I was supposed to learn what to do . This was supposed to tell me what faction to choose , the test . We 're supposed to trust the test . The test didn 't work on yöu . Yöu have to trust yöurself . ( MAN COUGHING ) ( DOOR CLOSES ) What happened to yöu today ? Where did yöu go after yöur test ? I got sick , so they sent me home early . Did yöu finish yöur test ? Mmm .. hmm . What was yöur result ? What was yöurs ? ANDREW : Why did yöu just leave without telling anybody ? I was sick . ANDREW : Beatrice ... I don 't think yöu understand the level of scrutiny we 're under . They 're doing everything they can to discredit us right now . Who is ? Erudite . They believe that they should be the governing faction , not us . So yöu have to be careful right now , okay ? Even Marcus is under attack . For what ? It 's an old accusation . That he mistreated his son and that 's why the boy defected . - Is that true ? - No . 'Course not . Children defect for all kinds of reasons . Don 't take too long in here . Yöu need a good night 's sleep ... For tomorrow . I , um ... We love yöu . Good night . NATALIE : ( SOFTLY ) I 'm so proud of yöu , honey . ( SIGHS ) - CALEB : Beatrice ? - What ? Tomorrow when we choose ... Yöu have to think of the family . Yeah . But yöu also have to think of yöurself . ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) ( WOMAN ON PA SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY IN DISTANCE ) ( ALL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ) ( MAN ON PA SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ) ( INDISTINCT TALKING ) MAN : ( ON PA ) Factions , please gather in yöur assigned areas . Morning , Jeanine . Good morning , Andrew . How is Marcus holding up ? As well as can be expected . We need to find out who 's behind these rumors . I think we all know who it is . If it 's someone from Erudite , I promise I 'll find out who . These are yöur children . I don 't think I knew they were choosing today . - What 's yöur name ? - I 'm ... I 'm Caleb . It 's a pleasure to meet yöu . Jeanine Matthews . And yöu are ? This is Beatrice . Well , yöu both have a big decision to make today . I 'm sure yöur parents will support whatever choice yöu make . That 's not supposed to be a choice . The test should tell us what to do . Yöu 're still free to choose . But yöu don 't really want that . Beatrice ... I want yöu to choose who yöu truly are and where yöu truly belong . Not on a whim . Not because yöu wish yöu were someone yöu 're not . But because yöu honestly know yöurself . I want yöu to choose wisely . And I know yöu will . ( APPLAUSE ) The faction system is a living being composed of cells , all of yöu . And the only way it can survive and thrive is for each of yöu to claim yöur rightful place . The future belongs to those who know where they belong . When we leave this room , yöu will no longer be dependents but full-fledged members of our society . Faction before blood . ALL : Faction before blood . I love yöu ... No matter what . MARCUS : Jonathan Ziegler . - MARCUS : Erudite . - ( ALL APPLAUDING ) MARCUS : Jeffrey Yates . - Dauntless . - ( ALL CHEERING ) Morgan Stokes . Amity . ( SOBBING ) MARCUS : Claire Satron . Candor . Sam Robertson . Abnegation . Caleb Prior . - Erudite . - ( FAINT GASPS ) ( ALL APPLAUDING ) MARCUS : Quiet , please . Beatrice Prior . Dauntless . ( ALL DAUNTLESS CHEERING ) Welcome to Dauntless ! ( ALL CHEERING ) BOY : Come on ! Let 's go ! GIRL : Come on ! Sorry . Yöu made it . - I 'm Christina . - Beatrice . Is it just me or are they trying to kill us ? Get ready ! ( WOMAN ON PA ANNOUNCING INDISTINCTLY ) Yeah ! - They 're jumping . - What ? ( WHOOPING CONTINUES ) What if yöu don 't jump ? What do yöu think ? Yöu 'll be factionless . Good luck , Al . Whoa ! ( GRUNTS ) ( WHOOPING ) - Together ? - Yeah . One , two , three ... ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( BOTH LAUGHING ) ERIC : All right , listen up ! I 'm Eric . I 'm one of yöur leaders . If yöu want to enter Dauntless , this is the way in . And if yöu don 't have the guts to jump , then yöu don 't belong in Dauntless . Is there water at the bottom or something ? I guess yöu 'll find out . Or not . We just jumped . They want us to jump again ? Someone 's gotta go first . Who 's it gonna be ? Me . Yeah , stiff , take it off ! Put it back on ! ( GRUNTS ) Today , Initiate . ( GASPS ) ( GASPS ) ( PANTING ) ( CHUCKLING ) What , yöu get pushed ? No . What 's yöur name ? It 's ... Is that a hard one ? Yöu can pick a new one if yöu want , but make it good . Yöu don 't get to pick again . Okay . My name 's Tris . First jumper , Tris ! - ( PEOPLE CHEERING ) - Welcome to Dauntless . ( BOY SCREAMING ) ( SHRIEKS ) Dauntless-born , go with Lauren , transfers stay with me . Go . LAUREN : This way . Most of the time I work in Intelligence , but during yöur training , I 'll be yöur instructor . My name 's Four . Four , like the number ? Exactly , like the number . What happened , one through three were taken ? What 's yöur name ? Christina . Well , Christina . The first lesson yöu learn from me if yöu wanna survive here , is keep yöur mouth shut . Do yöu understand me ? ( SOFTLY ) Yes . Good . Follow me . ( INDISTINCT TALKING AND CHEERING ) This is The Pit . The center of life here at Dauntless . ( CHEERING AND SHOUTING ) Yöu 're gonna be sleeping here for the next 10 weeks . Girls or boys ? Both . - GIRL 1 : Nice . - BOY 1 : That works . If yöu like this , yöu 're gonna love the bathroom . GIRL 2 : Great . BOY 1 : Okay ... - GIRL 2 : Seriously ? - BOY 2 : ls there no other area ? GIRL 2 : Are yöu kidding ? Yöu should feel right at home , Candor . Everything out in the open . BOY 2 : Is this a joke ? FOUR : Get changed . Right . Shower , anyone ? ( INDISTINCT TALKING ) PETER : Nice legs , stiff . ( INDISTINCT TALKING ) ( ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ) - BOY 1 : Hey . - BOY 2 : How yöu doin ' ? Shall we sit there ? Have yöu never seen a hamburger before ? No , I 've seen one . I just have never eaten one . Abnegation eat plain food . Plant-based diet with no sauces and a minimum of seasoning . Which textbook did yöu swallow ? ( CHUCKLES ) Nice to meet yöu , too . I 'm Will . Erudite . Of course yöu are . No offense , but I 'm surprised Abnegation even eats at all . Too selfish , right ? No wonder yöu left . Yöu gotta be pretty self-confident to be friends with a Candor . What is that supposed to mean ? Yöu have no filter . Yöu say the first thing that comes into yöur head . Yöu mean like , " Yöu 're an idiot " ? ( ALL CHUCKLING ) Nice one , Al . At least we tell the truth . Erudite can tell the truth because we have the facts . I don 't want to hear about yöur old factions . Yöu 're Dauntless now . Were yöu a transfer , too ? Or Dauntless-born ? Are yöu kidding ? No . What makes yöu think yöu can talk to me ? It ... Must be because yöu 're so approachable . ( CHRISTINA SCOFFS ) Careful . MAN : Four ... ( SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ) Yöu , my friend , have a death wish . ( WHISPERING ) Yöu know , he was first in his class . They tried to recruit him for leadership twice , but he said no . ( ALARM BLARING ) ( CUPS CLATTERING ) ( CLANKING CONTINUES ) Initiates , stand . Yöu have chosen to join the warrior faction tasked with the defense of this city and all its inhabitants . We believe in ordinary acts of bravery and the courage that drives one person to stand up for another . Respect that . Do us proud . ( ALL CHEERING ) ( LAUGHING ) Whoa ! ( LAUGHING ) ( CHEERING ) ( METAL CLANKING LOUDLY ) I want everyone in The Pit . Two minutes . ( MAN YELLING ORDERS ) There are two stages of training . The first is physical . Push yöur bodies to the breaking point and yöu 'll master the methods of combat . The second is mental . Again , breaking point . Yöu 'll face yöur worst fears and conquer them unless they get yöu first . Yöu 'll be trained separately from the Dauntless-born , but yöu 'll be ranked together . After initiations , rankings will determine what jobs yöu move into . Leadership , guarding the fence , or keeping the Factionless from killing each other . The rankings will also determine who gets cut . Cut ? At the end of each stage of training , the lowest-ranking Initiates will be leaving us . To do what ? There 's no going home to yöur families , so yöu 'd live factionless . Why didn 't we know that ? It 's a new rule . A new rule ? Somebody should have told us that . ERIC : Why ? Would yöu have chosen differently ? Out of fear ? I mean , if that 's the case , yöu might as well get out now . If yöu 're really one of us , it won 't matter to yöu that yöu might fail . Now yöu chose us . Now we get to choose yöu . ( PANTING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( SIGHS ) Statistically speaking , yöu should have hit the target at least once by now . Even by accident . Hey . What have yöu got ? Factionless . Not doing anything . Check it out , stiff . That 's gonna be yöur new family . - ( BABY CRYING ) - ( BOTTLES CLINKING ) Go say " Hi . " Yöu ready for some real fighting ? Not even close . ERIC : First jumper ! In the ring . Last jumper ! Time to fight . How long do we fight for ? Till one of yöu can 't continue . Or one of yöu concedes . According to the old rules . New rules , no one concedes . Yöu really want to lose 'em on their first fight ? A brave man never surrenders . Lucky for yöu , those weren 't the rules when we fought . Yöu 'll be scored on this , so fight hard . Go ! PETER : Don 't be scared , stiff ! - ( GRUNTS ) - CHRISTINA : Nice , Tris ! ( GRUNTS ) ( GASPS ) - BOY 1 : Nice . - BOY 2 : Yeah ! All right , guys , over here . Listen up . Know what this board is ? It 's yöur life . We grade yöu every day . If yöu 're still in the red by the end of the first stage , yöu 're out . TRIS : I 'm never gonna make it . CHRISTINA : Yes , yöu are . I 'm the weakest one here . Then yöu 'll be most improved . Yöu 're Candor . Yöu 're not supposed to lie . I was Candor . And I 'm not lying . If they cut me , I think my parents would take me back . WILL : No , it doesn 't work like that . Even if they wanted to , their faction wouldn 't allow it . Even if my parents would take me back , I wouldn 't belong there anymore . This is getting depressing . ALI ( CHUCKLING ) Yeah . CHRISTINA : Yöu know what we should do ? Get tattoos . ( HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING ) WILL : Did yöu know they had a tattoo of yöur face ? - Like it ? - WILL : Yeah . - Where would yöu get it ? - I don 't know . Where do yöu suggest ? Anywhere yöu want . Here , it 's this thing here . Yöu remember me , right ? I was just wondering if yöu could ... No . I just do tattoos . Okay . I 'd like this one . Please . ( POWERING UP ) Can I just ask yöu ... Yöu made a mistake choosing Dauntless . - They 'll find out about yöu ... - Who ? Who Will ? The people yöu 're a threat to . What people ? Who , Dauntless ? No , society . If yöu don 't fit into a category , they can 't control yöu . I don 't get it . I 'm Dauntless . I 'm going to be Dauntless . I chose Dauntless . TORI : For yöur sake , I hope so . ( GRUNTS ) ( PUNCHES RAPIDLY LANDING ) Yöu 're weak . Yöu have no muscle . Yöu 're never gonna win , not like that . That 's good to know . Yeah , yöu have to use yöur whole body . Keep tension here . - Okay ... - And go on offense . Yöu 're fast , so yöu could win if yöu attack first . Yöu get inside , yöu jab to the throat . ERIC : Four ! Keep working . ( GROANING ) AL : Sorry about that , Will . ( CHRISTINA GRUNTING ) Come on , Chris . ( GRUNTS ) Stop ... Stop ! ( COUGHS ) I 'm done . I 'm done . Yöu need to stop ? ( PANTING ) Okay . Let me give yöu a hand . Thanks . All right , let 's everyone take a break ! Yöu feelin ' a little better ? Yeah , I 'm fine . ( SHRIEKS ) Whoa ! ERIC : Grab the rail . ( GRUNTING ) - Or don 't . - ( GASPS ) Yöu 've got three options . Hang there and I 'll forget yöur cowardice . Fall and die . ( CHRISTINA GROANING ) Or give up . But if yöu give up , yöu 're out . ( CHRISTINA PANTING ) ( GRUNTS ) Come on , Chris ! ( CHRISTINA GROANING ) ( METAL CREAKING ) ( STRAINING ) Time ! ( CONTINUES GRUNTING ) ( PANTING ) Dauntless never give up . ( PANTING ) ( SOBBING ) FOUR : As Dauntless , we fight to protect every life inside the fence , without fail . That 's why we train yöu the way we do . To teach yöu not to give up . And to find out who has what it takes . Even though it 's been quiet out there for years , that could change at any moment . So we have to be ready for everything . BOY : Whoo ! - What 's out there ? - Monsters . ( CHUCKLES ) Amity farms . No , I know . But beyond that ? Places that never recovered from the war . Do yöu know ? Let 's just say they built their fence for a reason . - ( GIRL GRUNTING ) - BOY : Man ! ( BOY LAUGHS ) Yöu 're kinda good at this . BOY : Come on . ( CLANGING ) That was pathetic . ( CLANGING ) ( SCOFFS ) It slipped . Well , go get it ! What , while they 're throwing ? Are yöu afraid ? Of getting stabbed by an airborne knife ? Yeah . Everybody stop . Stand in front of the target . Four , gimme a hand here . Yöu 're gonna stand there while he throws those knives . And if I see yöu flinch , yöu 're out . One thing yöu will learn here is that orders are not optional . ( SIGHS ) Stop . Anyone can stand in front of a target . It doesn 't prove anything . Then it should be easy for yöu to take his place . Same rules apply . ( SIGHS ) Oh , come on , Four . Yöu can get closer than that . Yöu want me to give her a little trim ? Yeah , maybe just a little off the top . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( GRUNTS ) Points for bravery , stiff . Not as many as yöu just lost for opening yöur mouth . Now watch yöurself . We train soldiers , not rebels . But we 're done for today . Get out . ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) - Yöu all right ? - Yöu cut me . I meant to . Yöu meant to ? Yöu think he was gonna let yöu off without a scratch ? Yöu 'd still be standing there if I hadn 't hit yöu . So am I supposed to thank yöu ? Yöu 're supposed to be smart . If I wanted to hurt yöu , I would have . ( ALL CHEERING ) There she is . Yöu do have a death wish . I can 't believe yöu said that to Eric . Yöu 're the only one who 's ever stood up to him . Look at yöur ear . Let 's get yöu cleaned up . Hey , Tris . That was cool . Thanks . ( CHUCKLES ) ( SNICKERING ) Impressive , stiff . Congrats . WILL : Shut up . What ? Hey , yöu 're famous now . I mean , not because of the thing with Eric . Yöu 're in the news . Yeah , listen . " The recent transfers of Beatrice and Caleb Prior , " children of Andrew Prior , " call into question the soundness " of Abnegation 's teachings and values . " What prompted them to leave ? " Perhaps the answer lies in the corrupted ideal of an entire faction . " The theft of resources , the general incompetence , " the abuse of their children . " Did they beat yöu , like Marcus Eaton 's kid ? They didn 't beat anyone . They 're good people . Right . And that 's why yöu left ? Was it something I said ? - He 's an idiot . - Yeah . Yeah . That 's okay . What 's she doing at Dauntless ? ( SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ) Prior . Yöu 're Andrew Prior 's daughter , aren 't yöu ? Beatrice . It 's just Tris now . Tris , I like that . Hmm . Yöu made an impressive choice , Tris , despite yöur parents . And yöur test result . Yöu 've seen my test result ? Of course . I 'm glad yöu were smart enough to know yöur own mind . Let me know if yöu ever need anything . Well , that was weird . Yeah . AL : What do yöu think is goin ' on ? WILL : I bet they 're hunting Divergents . That 's all they talk about at Erudite these days . AL : Wait . Divergents are real ? CHRISTINA : Come on , Al . ERIC : First fight . Peter versus Tris . GIRL : What ? BOY : Uh .. Oh . It 's Eric . He 's just trying to get back at yöu . - FOUR : Hey . - TRIS : What ? Remember what I said about attack ? First shot , right to the throat . And yöu watch him . He steps before he punches . All right ? Mmm . PETER : All right there , stiff ? Look like yöu 're about to cry . Might take it easy on yöu if yöu cry . CHRISTINA : Come on , Tris . ( GRUNTS ) - ( GRUNTS ) - ( PETER GASPS ) - ( GRUNTS ) - ( GROANS ) PETER : Get up . Get up . Come on . Stop playin ' with each other . ( PANTING ) - ( GRUNTS ) - ( GROANS ) ( COUGHS ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Wow . Yöu look ... Look bad . How long have I been here ? About a day . A day ? Have yöu seen the scoreboard ? Where am I ? Yöu got below the line . Why are yöu wearing those vests ? War games . Whoa . What are yöu doing ? - I 'm coming . - Yöu can 't . WILL : Eric says yöu 're done . What ? He said yöu 're out . Yöur father 's on the council , Tris . Maybe they 'll make an exception and let yöu go home . We 're sorry , Tris . WILL : We gotta go . We 're gonna miss the train . Yeah , okay . - CHRISTINA : Bye . - TRIS : Bye . - WILL : Bye . - TRIS : Bye . ( GRUNTS ) Thanks . ( EXHALES ) CHRISTINA : Hi . - Hi . - What are yöu doing here ? TRIS : I just figured that I had to make it . Who let yöu out ? I did . Yöu did ? Okay . CHRISTINA : Let 's sit yöu down . The game 's simple . It 's like Capture the Flag . Weapon of choice . Yöu call that a gun ? ( GROANING ) Neuro-stim dart . Simulates the pain of a real gunshot wound . Only lasts a couple minutes . Two teams . Four and I are captains . Yöu pick first . Okay . Edward . I 'll take the stiff . Oh . Picking the weak ones so yöu 've got someone to blame when yöu lose . Something like that . CHRISTINA : Where did Eric 's team go ? WILL : They must have gone to the end . All right . Lights off . Gather around . Come on . Okay . What 's yöur strategy ? We can hide the flag well enough so they can 't find it . Let 's send out a team to scout their location . See if we can find their flag . I say we blitz them . Just beat them with sheer force . AL : Yeah , that 's the best way to lose quickly . EZRA : End this quickly , they won 't expect it . WILL : We don 't know where they are . Okay , we split into two groups , defense and offense . EZRA : Who put yöu in charge ? CHRISTINA : Someone has to make a decision . EZRA : We need to be more aggressive . WILL : We need to be smart about it . ( ARGUING CONTINUES ) Yöu 're not gonna jump , are yöu ? No , I 'm just trying to get a good vantage point . Good thinking . Yöu don 't have to come with me . Yöu should go easy . Yöu took a beating . I 'm surprised yöu noticed . I saw yöu leave during the fight . Yeah , well , it 's not something I wanted to watch . FOUR : Hey ! Yöu good ? Yöu Okay ? Yeah . I 'm fine . ( GRUNTING ) This is high enough . No , we need to go higher . Yöu all right ? Yöu 're afraid of heights . Everyone 's afraid of something . I didn 't think yöu were afraid of anything . FOUR : Come on , Tris . ( GRUNTING ) Really ? Are yöu even human ? ( PANTING ) This isn 't so bad . Good eye . Look ! ( CHUCKLES ) There it is . FOUR : All right . What 's yöur plan ? TRIS : We split into two groups . We 'll go up this side and let the rest of yöu engage Eric . - BOY 1 : I can see ' em . - BOY 2 : Go ! Go ! Light ' em up ! ( GROANING ) BOY : There 's two more ! I 'm gonna move in closer ! Follow me . Go ! ( BOY AND GIRL GROANING ) - BOY : Watch on yöur right ! - GIRL : Go , go , go . - Go . - Christina , let 's go !

( BOY GROANING ) ( GROANING ) ( GRUNTS ) CHRISTINA : Go , Tris ! I 'll guard . ( GRUNTING ) ( YELLS ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GROANS ) Whoo ! ( ALL CHEERING ) WILL : Game over ! AL : Good job , Tris ! ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) Hey , Tris ! - Yeah ? - Come with us . Where yöu going ? Shortcut back . A little initiation ritual , Dauntless style . ( EXCITED INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) ( PANTING ) TRIS : Wow . BOY : All right , let 's do this ! - BOY 1 : All right , yöu good ? - BOY 2 : Good . - GIRL : Yeah . Go , go ! - BOY : Hang tight . - Fly , baby . - Whoo ! Yöu 're up . BOY : All right , do it ! - ( SIGHS ) - Come on , girl . Go for it ! Do it , Tris ! GIRL : Like flying ! Don 't forget to pull the brake at the bottom ! TRIS : Okay . BOY : Go . BOY 1 : Yöu ready ? BOY 2 : Harness is good . ( SCREAMING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( GROANS ) - Pull the brake ! - Pull the brake ! ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( ALL CHEERING ) Yeah ! FOUR : Tris ! - Hey . - Hey . Congratulations . Thanks . Yöu know , I wanted to say that yöu were really good tonight . Yöu were brave . Yeah . Anyway , yöu should get back to yöur friends . Okay . If yöu 're ranked above the red line , yöu 'll move on to the second stage of training . If yöu 're below it , we 'll waste no more time on yöu . Here are yöur rankings . ( ALL CHEERING ) - WILL : Nice . ( CHUCKLING ) AL : Yöu made it . CHRISTINA : Yöu made it , Tris . - BOY 1 : Got it . - BOY 2 : Thank yöu . ( INDISTINCT TALKING ) Here yöu go . So we pass the first stage of training , and this is our reward . MAN : Toss it up ! Glamorous . ( TRUCK ENGINE STARTS ) ( GASPS ) Mom ? ( SIGHS ) Oh , my girl ! Mom , what are yöu doing here ? I knew they 'd assign yöu here sooner or later . Look at yöu ! God , yöu 're so strong and beautiful . Mom , yöu can 't be here . I know , but yöu 're in danger . What ? I had to ask yöu something . Yöu weren 't sick the day yöu took yöur aptitude test , were yöu ? - Why ? - What were yöur test results ? ( WHISPERING ) Honey , it 's okay . Yöu can tell me . They were ... They were inconclusive . Divergent ? Yöu can 't tell anyone . Yöu can 't tell yöur friends , yöur instructors . Yöu can 't trust anyone . - ( PA SYSTEM WHINING ) - I 'm not . People have always been so threatened by Divergents . But now Erudite is looking for them everywhere . They 're actively seeking them out . Why ? ( WHISPERING ) Mom , what am I ? Yöu don 't conform . Yöur mind works in a million different ways . They 're scared of yöu . Stage two of training is where yöu are most at risk . They 're gonna get inside yöur head and watch how yöu respond to fear . But yöu can pass . Yöu can make it through Dauntless . I have seen it before . How do yöu know so much about this ? About Dauntless ? Never mind about me . Do not let them know who yöu are . Wait ! Wait ! Were yöu Dauntless ? - Listen . - GUARD : Hey ! What are yöu doing ? Truck 's loaded . Let 's go . ( GROANING ) What did they do to her ? Tris . Take a seat . I 'm going to inject yöu with a serum that stimulates the part of yöur brain that processes fear . Great . It induces a hallucination , and then transmitters in the serum allow me to see the images in yöur mind . Yöu can see inside my mind ? Mmm .. hmm . Lay back . ( GROANS ) ( SIGHS ) Now , yöu 're gonna be facing yöur worst fears , Tris . Most people have 10 to 15 really bad ones . Yöu have to calm yöurself . Slow yöur heart rate and yöur breathing , and deal with what 's in front of yöu . Be brave . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) ( CROWS CAWING ) ( PANTING ) ( SQUELCHING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( CAWING CONTINUES ) ( GROANING ) This isn 't real . ( MUFFLED GROANING ) ( GASPS ) It 's all right , it 's all right . - Yöu okay ? - ( GASPING ) ( SIGHING ) How long do yöu think yöu were in the hallucination , Tris ? - Twenty minutes ? - Three . Four times faster than the average . I 've never seen anyone do that well the first time . How did yöu get rid of the birds ? The image wasn 't clear . Um ... I just went into the water . Well , next time it 'll be a lot easier . I have to do that again ? Yeah , yöu have to practice several times before the final , but yöu 're a natural . Yöu got nothing to worry about . CHRISTINA : My whole body was covered in these little insects . They were in my ears , and my throat ... I couldn 't breathe . Yeah , I heard about this guy , like two years ago ... So panicked he had a heart attack in his chair - and he almost died . - What ? Yeah , so we 've got that to look forward to , right ? ( ALL CHUCKLING ) Yöu didn 't seem to have any problem at all . Me ? No , no , my God , it was awful . Oh , come on . No one even came close to yöur time . - Yöu were amazing . - Yeah , what 's amazing is that she 's gonna knock yöu right out of Dauntless . She 's not gonna knock me out of Dauntless . Look , she 's gone from being the worst to one of the best . Somebody 's gotta take her place at the bottom . Who 's it gonna be ? Yöu . Do yöu ever stop talking ? I just want to know how she does it . What 's yöur trick ? I don 't have a trick . Nobody gets through it that fast . Why don 't yöu tell us how yöu do it ? At least tell yöur friends . What 's he talkin ' about ? Is there some way to make it easier ? No . No , I ... ( STAMMERS ) I 'm not doing anything . ( PANTING ) ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) ( GROANS ) ( WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY ) ( LAUGHING ) Hey ! Hey ! ( PANTING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( GASPING ) This isn 't real . ( GASPS ) ( SIGHS ) How 'd yöu do that ? What ? How 'd yöu break the glass ? ( SIGHS ) I don 't know . Just did it . Yöu just did it ? ( BEEPING ) What were yöur test results ? Yöur aptitude test . Abnegation . I don 't think so . What ? I think yöu 're lying to me . Why would I lie to yöu ? I 'm gonna ask yöu one more time . What were yöur test results ? Abnegation . Time for yöu to go . Tris ? Just so yöu know , Dauntless don 't break the glass like that . TORI : My brother was like yöu . During the second stage , he got good really fast . Last day of the simulations , one of the Dauntless leaders came to watch him . Then the next morning , we found his body at the bottom of the chasm . They got rid of him . Who did ? Dauntless leadership . Yöu can 't let them find out about yöu . And what if they already know ? Then yöu 're already dead . Beatrice . What are yöu doing here ? TRIS : I 'm in trouble . What happened ? I 'm not gonna make it at Dauntless . I don 't fit in there . Yöu have to fit in there . I can 't . ( STAMMERING ) I 'm just ... I 'm not like them . ( CHUCKLES ) I mean , who is ? They 're crazy . Maybe I can go back to Abnegation . - Yöu can 't go back . - I know , but ... They 're never gonna let yöu do that . ( SIGHS ) - Who ? - Erudite . They 're not gonna let Abnegation break any more rules . ( SCOFFS ) They actually think that they 're running the government now ? They might be soon . Wait . Really ? Erudite should be in charge . Certainly not Abnegation . Wait , hold on , Caleb . How can yöu say that ? It 's what all the other factions want , now that Abnegation failed . No . That 's just what they 're telling yöu here ... - it 's true . - It 's not true . - ( MAN SHUSHES ) - ( QUIETLY ) It 's not . There are liars here . There are people who know how to manipulate yöu . Yöu need to understand that . Beatrice . I think yöu should go . Faction before blood . Yeah ? Got it . I need yöu to come with me . - ( GRUNTS ) - JEANINE : Stop ! Are yöu all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Please , sit down . Thank yöu . I 'm glad yöu came here today . Yöu are ? Are yöu happy with yöur new faction ? Yeah . But yöu came to see yöur brother . I just ... I just wanted to talk to him . Have yöu seen yöur parents ? No . - It 's hard to let go . - ( CUP CLATTERS ) Faction before blood . It 's an important ideal , but sometimes difficult to fulfill . It goes against our fundamental human nature . But that 's exactly the weakness we need to overcome . Yöu think that human nature is a weakness ? I think human nature is the enemy . It 's human nature to keep secrets , lie , steal . And I wanna eradicate that . That 's how we 'll maintain a stable , peaceful society . Yöu would help me with that , wouldn 't yöu ? How would I help yöu ? Yöu 're aware that Abnegation is undermining the faction system and breaking laws , harboring Divergents ? I didn 't know that . ( CLEARS THROAT ) But if that 's true , then I 'm glad that I left . See , I need to know that I can count on yöu to enforce the law , even if it 's been broken by someone close to yöu . Someone yöu care about . Of course . Good . Then I 'll have my car take yöu back to Dauntless . ( DOOR OPENS ) ( DOOR CLOSES ) ( MUFFLED SCREAMING ) ( GRUNTING ) MAN : Come on ! Get her over ! Come on , do it ! Do it ! FOUR : Hey ! - ( GRUNTS ) - ( GROANS ) ( MEN GROANING ) Yöu all right ? Yeah . Come on . Let 's go . Here , put this on . Thank yöu . Yöu 'll be safe here . ( SIGHS ) ( BASIN CLATTERS ) ( GASPS ) Sorry . It 's okay . I can 't believe Al ... Yöu 're moving up through the ranks , and he 's failing . It makes him hate himself and it makes him hate yöu . He 's just afraid . Everyone 's afraid . I know , but fear does something strange to people like Al . But not yöu . Fear doesn 't shut yöu down , it wakes yöu up . I 've seen it . Yöu should lie down . - Get some sleep . - Yeah . I 'll take the floor . How yöu feeling ? Better . Good . ( TAPPING ) Where 'd yöu go yesterday ? To see my brother . It 's getting a little boring for yöu here , is it ? My brother said that ... He thinks Erudite is planning to overthrow Abnegation . Do yöu think they could do that ? Yeah , I do . I think it 's possible . Depends how far they 're willing to go . I 'm worried about my parents . Yeah . But I think yöu got other things yöu need to worry about . Don 't yöu ? Yeah . I should go . ( FOOTSTEPS RECEDE ) ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) CHRISTINA : Hi . Hey ! Is that yöur sweater ? No . So what happened to yöu last night ? AL : Tris , can I talk to yöu for a second ? Listen , I just wanted to say that I 'm sorry . I don 't know what 's wrong with me . Please , can yöu ever forgive me ? If yöu ever come close to me again , I will kill yöu . Tris ... Yöu need to stay away from me ! Yöu are a coward . I just can 't believe he would do that . It 's not like him at all . WILL : What 's that ? BOY 1 : Come on . ( ALL GRUNTING ) ( GASPS ) Oh. my God ! BOY 2 : Guess he just jumped . ( GASPS ) Tris . Tris ! Leave me alone . I 'm sorry about Al . It 's my fault that he 's dead . No , it 's not because of yöu . He made his own choice . He would have been factionless . He was not gonna pass that final test . TRIS : Neither am I. Why do yöu say that ? Yöu know why . And as soon as all the others find out , they 're gonna kill me . I 'm not gonna let that happen . Shut the door . Yöu 're gonna practice . - In my fear landscape ? - No . In mine . We go in together . Have yöu ever done this before ? No , I haven 't . Yöu sure yöu want to ? Why wouldn 't I ? I don 't know . Yöu haven 't told me anything about yöurself and now yöu 're just gonna let me inside of yöur head ? Are yöu afraid of that ? Yöu 're not ? No . ( PANTING ) Fear of heights . I 'm not surprised . It 's not real . - We could just jump . - No . Divergent would jump . Dauntless would get to that building . If yöu want to pass , if yöu want to avoid discovery , yöu have to do everything the way a Dauntless would do it . Yöu have to find some tool , some method to survive . ( DOOR CLOSING ) ( FOUR GROANS ) Fear of confinement . Yöu have to find a way of stopping it . What would a Dauntless do ? Good ! - ( GRUNTS ) - Take yöur time . I 'm just enjoying myself in this shrinking box . ( PANTING ) As a Dauntless soldier , yöu have to follow orders yöu don 't always agree with . Who is she ? She 's an innocent . I have to kill her . But I can never do it . Unless I look away . ( GUNSHOT ) ( FOUR BREATHING HEAVILY ) Why are we in Abnegation ? Yöur last fear is yöur worst fear . It lives in the deepest part of yöur mind . Marcus had a son . What was his name ? Tobias . MARCUS : Tobias . Tobias ... ( ECHOING ) Tobias ... Tobias ... I 'm just trying to help yöu to be better . TRIS : No ! ( GASPS ) ( PANTING ) ( SIGHS ) Four ? Four fears ? Four then , four now . I keep going in there , but I don 't think yöu ever lose them . Can I ask yöu something ? Sure . What 's yöur tattoo ? Yöu wanna see it ? It 's amazing . TRIS : The factions . Why do yöu have all of them ? I don 't want to be just one thing . I can 't be . I want to be brave and I want to be selfless ... Intelligent and honest and kind . Although I 'm still working on " kind . " I don 't wanna go too fast . It 's okay . I 've already got my spot on the floor . ( CHUCKLES ) TRIS : Morning . Hey ! Come on . I 'm gonna show yöu something . Okay . Look . - Erudite . - Yeah . They 're here every morning . I 've been watching them for weeks . What are they doing at Dauntless ? Loading in supplies . Computers . And these . TRIS : What is it ? I think it 's some kind of cognitive transmitter . Yöu inject it like a serum . Why ? It 's supposed to make yöu more susceptible to suggestion , but as many as they have , they could create an army . MAN : ( ON PA ) Attention , all initiates report for final testing . All initiates report for final testing . Yöu 're ready . Yöu can do this . They can see yöur hallucinations on the screen . So yöu get past yöur fears the way a Dauntless would , but do it quickly . Right . If I 'm too good , then they 'll kill me , and if I 'm too slow , then I 'll die . Right . Good luck . Good luck , Tris . Hope yöu make it . ( CAWING ) ( PANTING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( PANTING ) FOUR : Congratulations . Whoa . Four ! Stop ! Four ! Aren 't yöu Dauntless ? ( GRUNTS ) ( GASPS ) ( AUDIENCE APPLAUDS ) Please tell me that yöu weren 't watching that . Would yöu feel better if I said no ? Yöu did well . Now ... One final test . Yöu know what to do . What ? If yöu want to be Dauntless . No . Do it . - ( GASPS ) - ( PANTING ) FOUR : Yöu all right ? That looked good to me , okay ? Come on . Let 's go . Congratulations , new members of Dauntless . ( ALL CHEERING ) ALL : ( CHANTING ) Dauntless ! Dauntless ! Dauntless ! ( ALL SPEAKING EXCITEDLY ) FEMALE LEADER : Come on . Get in line . MALE LEADER : All right , everybody , line up . What 's going on ? MAN : ( ON PA ) All Dauntless initiates , report to yöur command leader . ERIC : All right , listen up ! Before yöu leave tonight , I want yöu all in four lines . Everyone gets a tracking device . Don 't ask questions . It 's just a precaution . Do yöu see Four ? CHRISTINA : No . WOMAN : Next ! - WILL : What 's going on ? - Oh , my God . Congratulations . Yöu should be first in line , but ... I 'll make it easy for yöu . ERIC : Hurts like a bitch , huh ? Now yöu 're really one of us . ( DOOR OPENING ) Hey , what 's ... MAN : ( ON PA ) Faction before blood . Oh , my God . MAX : They can see and hear us . They just don 't process it the same way . Commands come in through the transmitter . What 's goin ' on ? What are we doin ' ? Divergent . ERIC : Hey ! Everything 's fine . There 's nothing to worry about . - ( GUNSHOT ) - ( THUDDING ) ( GASPS ) ( SIGHS ) ( SIREN WAILING ) MAN : Hurry up ! Move ! ( GLASS SHATTERS ) ( WOMAN SCREAMS ) MAN : ( ON PA ) Abnegation leaders must identify themselves . We need to find my parents .

Yöu will not be hurt . TRIS : Mom ? Dad ? Where would they have gone ? I don 't know . WOMAN : This can 't happen here ! Just stop it ! MAN : ( ON PA ) Do not resist . All Abnegation will be questioned . The legendary Four ... A mindless drone . Yöu were first in yöur class . Now yöu 're ... Nothing . What ? Think he might be ... There 's one way to find out . ERIC : Say goodbye , asshole . Good bye . Move and yöu die ! The stiff ? ( CHUCKLING ) Two stiffs . ERIC : Two dead stiffs . Yöu can 't let a single Divergent slip through . This is what happens . She 's not gonna shoot me . Think yöu might be overestimating my character . - ( GUNSHOT ) - ( GROANS ) FOUR : Run ! ( GROANS ) ( GUNSHOT ) - Yöu were hit ? - Yeah . Right there ! Don 't move ! MAX : Drop yöur weapons . ( MAN ANNOUNCING INDISTINCTLY ON PA ) Tobias Eaton . And yöu , Beatrice . I thought it was intellect I was sensing in yöu . Maybe yöu 're not as smart as yöu think yöu are . Why are yöu attacking all these innocent people ? Innocent people ? Abnegation , if left unchecked , will destroy the faction system . Same can be said of both of yöu . Somebody has to stop yöu . If we don 't , peace will be lost . It 's already been lost . Yöu destroyed it . Human nature destroyed it . Those of us with the vision to see that are called upon to protect the rest . We will restore the peace . And this time , it will last . And what if yöu 're wrong ? Bring him with us . ( GROANS ) ( CLICKS TONGUE ) She 's injured . Any results would be unclear . - Yöu can get rid of her . - SOLDIER : All right . ( GROANING ) Get down ! ( SIGHS ) SOLDIER : Let 's go . Come on ! MAN : ( ON PA ) Additional security teams , report to mobile command Level 5 . ( GUNSHOT ) ( GUNSHOTS CONTINUE ) Beatrice ! - Mom ? Mom ! - Beatrice . Okay . Okay , we gotta run ! Yöu were Dauntless . Served me well today . Is Dad okay ? Yeah . He led a group over to Monroe and State . We 're gonna meet him there . ( YELLING INDISTINCTLY ) Let 's go !

( GUNSHOTS FIRING ) ( GROANS ) - Yöu okay ? Good . - Yeah , I 'm good . Okay ! Let 's go ! We 're good . Mom ? Mom ... What is it ? Hey ... Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom , no ! Mom ! Mom ! ( SOBBING ) Mom ? Mom ! Mom , wake up ! Mom ! Oh , my God , Mom ! ( GUNSHOTS CONTINUE ) Stop ! Stop ! ( SOBBING ) I love yöu , Mom ... Oh , my God ! ( PANTING ) ( SOBBING ) TRIS : Where 's my father ? ANDREW : Beatrice ? ( PEOPLE WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY ) Yöur mother ? She saved me . ( SNIFFLES ) She saved me . Then it wasn 't in vain . We need to leave here . Are there soldiers outside ? No , it 's clear . I should have believed yöu . I left as soon as I realized . Why is this happening ? I don 't understand . Why are Dauntless fighting for Erudite ? They don 't know what they 're doing . They 're under simulation . We need to wake ' em up . I need to get into Dauntless . MARCUS : That 's a fortress . It 's not gonna happen . I can get us in there . TRIS : Get ready . What now ? Yöu 're not gonna like it . There 's a net at the bottom . Don 't think , just jump . ( GROANS ) ( PANTING ) Are yöu good ? Good ? Let 's go . Wait here . Against the wall . Against the wall ! How are yöu awake ? Because I 'm smarter than yöu . And they need me . Where are they controlling it from ? Why would I tell yöu that ? It 's not like yöu 're gonna shoot me . Why do people keep saying that ? - ( GUNSHOT ) - ( SCREAMS ) ( GROANS ) Where are they controlling it from ? Did yöu really need to shoot him ? Every minute we waste , another Abnegation dies and another Dauntless becomes a murderer . TRIS : Peter , let 's go . That 's it , isn 't it ? Yeah . I 've seen Jeanine go in there . That 's where she 's controlling it from . Like yöu said , there isn 't a second to waste . - Dad , no ! - ( GUNSHOTS FIRING ) Dad ... - ( GUNFIRE CONTINUES ) - MAN : Hey ! ( GROANS ) ( GRUNTS ) Watch Caleb . I 'm going in there . ( PEOPLE CHATTING INDISTINCTLY ) Hey . Hi . ( GRUNTS ) Four ... Four ... Four , it 's me . Yöu 're in a sim . He can 't hear yöu . Amazing , isn 't it ? Everything we think of that makes up a person , thoughts , emotions , history ... All wiped away by chemistry . Four . He 's gone . And we 're all safer for it . Safer ? How are we safer ? The brilliance of the faction system is that conformity to the faction removes the threat of anyone exercising their independent will . Divergents threaten that system . Don 't get me wrong . There 's a certain beauty in yöur resistance , yöur defiance of categorization . But it 's a beauty we can 't afford . Four , it 's me . It 's me . Please , Four , look at me . Look at me . ( GRUNTS ) ( BOTH GRUNTING ) Four ! It 's me ! ( GROANING ) Four , stop ! Stop ! Stop ... Four ... Please ... It 's okay , it 's okay . I love yöu . It 's okay . It 's okay . I love yöu . It 's okay . Four , look at me . Look at me . ( WHISPERING ) It 's me . It 's me . It 's me . It 's me . ( PANTING ) Tris ... Go . Finish it .

I admire yöu willing to die for what yöu believe ... But so am I. Yöu can 't do it , can yöu ? ( SIREN WAILING ) ( SOBBING ) Maybe yöu 're not quite as Dauntless as yöu thought yöu were . Yöu 're right . I 'm not . I 'm Divergent . ( GROANS ) Now shut it down and wipe the program . ( PANTING ) WOMAN : ( ON PA ) Simulation abort . - ( BEEPING ) - System-wide shutdown . JEANNE ' . No ... No ... No ! ( GRUNTS ) Don 't get me wrong . There 's a certain beauty to yöur resistance . ( GRUNTS ANGRILY ) FOUR : Tris ... WOMAN : ( ON PA ) Lockdown now in effect . MAXI All right , let 's move ! We gotta go . Now . Tobias . We need to keep moving . All right , move ! Son ! I got it ! I know yöu do . TRIS : My mom and dad died today . They 're gone . FOUR : I know . But they loved yöu , Tris . For them , there was no better way to show yöu . ( SNIFFLES ) Now we have nothing . We have no home , no faction ... I don 't even know who I am anymore . I know exactly who yöu are . Yöu sure about that ? Yeah , I 'm very sure . Come here . TRIS : We 're like the Factionless now . We 've left everything behind , but we found ourselves and each other . Tomorrow we may have to fight again , but , for now , we 'll ride the train to the end of the line ... And then we 'll jump . " Hope You 've Liked Enjoyed The Movie " Copyright from ecOtOne ™

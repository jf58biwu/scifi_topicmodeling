 Huh , this way a little more , come on , come on . Oh , hey , h-hey , hey , hey , come on . Hey , come on . Come on . Oh , come on , no fair . Come on , come on . Wow . Hey . Oh , look at all the flowers , pretty flowers . What kind of work were they doing out there ? It 's just standard field research , it 's nothing dangerous . Yeah , then why hasn 't anyone heard from them in the last 72 hours ? Well , that 's what we 're going there to find out . Stop worrying . Commander Taylor says we 'll probably be back before dinner . Well , you 'd better be 'cause that Reynolds kid is coming a-courting tonight . Oh , don 't make fun . I think it 's really sweet , the way he 's going about things the old-fashioned way . Well , I think it 's weird . I 'm telling you , it 's a tech situation , not a science situation . The signal has been spotty out in that area for weeks . I 'm sure it 's just a downed comm relay , but if I need you , I will let you know . They 're my people out there . I should be going with you . I 'll take my own rover . Don 't worry , Malcolm , I 'll be your eyes out there . You 'll get a full report . Thank you , Elisabeth . Lieutenant Washington is in command while I 'm off-colony . You need anything , you talk to her . All right , let 's go . All right , be safe . Oh , no , my wedding ring . I took it off before surgery this morning . Um , could you stop by the hospital and pick it up for me ? It should be in my scrub locker , I think . Uh , sure . Unless , of course , I left it inside a patient . - Doc ... ? - See you . So they give you your own rover , huh ? Chief Science Officer ... one of the perks of the job . Well , I 'm the only cop in town , they didn 't give me one . That must be awkward with your siren . Whoa , whoa , Doc . That gate should not be open . Commander ! Looks like they 've had ovosaurs out here chewing on the power cables . Let 's make sure none of ' em wandered in . Stay alert . Don 't you wander either , Doc ... stick close . What kind of work did you say they were doing at this outpost ? Wetlands research . Commander Taylor ! Come on ! Doc , take a look at this . Brady , let 's get this door open . The snow was up to my knees , but I must have run for an hour straight . I guess that 's how I wound up here . Are you with the Red Cross ? Something like that , yes . This is gonna help you relax . Here we go . Snow up to her knees ? I guess I must 've missed the blizzard . Not if you were in Detroit in 2137 . It was the coldest October ever recorded , while the city burned . - The Detroit Food Riots . - Yeah . From what I can tell , that 's where she thinks she is . She has no idea she 's in Terra Nova . - Doc , what 's going on here ? - I don 't know . Her vitals are normal . There doesn 't appear to be anything physically wrong . It 's some sort of dissociative disorder . What about the other two ? My best guess ... same thing , only more advanced . Look , Doc , three people don 't just lose their minds at the same time . There 's got to be a reason . Hmm ... It 's Wednesday , I think . I can 't be sure . It 's happening to me just like with the others . First , short-term memory becomes jumbled , confused . Then one finds oneself somewhere in one 's past . I don 't recognize him . He 's not in the infirmary . This outpost has a staff of four . That 's Dr. Jonathan Guagenti . He 's head researcher here . Brady . I ought to remember the three people in the infirmary . This fella is still missing . Search the perimeter ... 200-yard radius . Be back by sundown . Yes , sir . I know I have to tell someone about the pathogens before they spread . I just can 't remember who . Okay , a pathogen ... so that 's what 's behind this . So what are the chances we 've been exposed ? Fairly likely , I 'm afraid . Well , it looks like he 's made some progress towards a diagnosis , but then his handwriting just deteriorates and then it becomes a nursery rhyme . You think you can finish what he started ? I can try . Try hard , Doc . Till we know what this is , we 're not going home . Mr. Shannon . Yeah . Dr. Shannon 's wedding ring . Oh , great , thanks . You didn 't have to cut anyone open , did you ? Never mind , thank you . What are you two doing here ? Shouldn 't you be at school ? Zoe 's sick , and this time she 's not pretending . It 's just a cold , but they asked me to take her out of class . I need Mommy . Oh , I 'm sorry , sweetie , Mommy 's not here . Where is she ? Well , she had to go save some other people . Tell you what , why don 't we go see if there 's anything in this hospital for a cold , and then I take you home ? Just be careful . Don 't catch her cold . I never catch colds . Only crooks . Ah , here 's another one . To the stars . God , they 're beautiful . - Hey , any word from Outpost Three ? - I heard they went dark . My mom 's out there now ... nothing yet . You 're good . Thanks . No , don 't stop . Any luck finding Guagenti ? Found his boots . He 's out there barefoot ? No , his feet were still in ' em . Oh . You got enough to go on to figure out what we 're dealing with here ? Yeah , I think so . All right . This outpost is under general quarantine ... nobody in or out . I 'm not going to risk exposing anyone or the colony to this . So do ... do you know what it is ? Some kind of memory loss . Could be anything ... contaminated rations or an insect bite . I 'm running blood samples now . I should know more soon . You 're not just making all this up to get out of tonight , are you ? Of course not . What time 's Maddy 's gentleman caller coming , anyway ? I don 't know , but she 's changed outfits , like three times already . I used to do that for you , you know . Be nice to him . I 'll try . I love you . Love you , too . Kiss the kids for me . All right . What was that ? Oh , I picked up a cold . Fluids and straight to bed . I don 't want to catch your cold when I get back . It 's not my cold ; I borrowed it from Zoe . Okay , feel better , I 'll call you in the morning . Bye . Bye . Zoe ? Who 's Zoe ? Some more Key lime pie ? Not that there 's actually any lime in it because limes won 't evolve until millions of years later . - Anyway ... - So , uh , do you find that you enjoy cooking ? Yeah , um , it 's kind of like chemistry , except , at the end , you get a treat . Um , I should get going . Right , yeah . Oh , sorry . Oh . Whoops . Well , um , thank you for welcoming me into your home . Uh , bye , Mr. Shannon . Okay , tell me the truth ... was that the worst first date in the history of the universe ? Not even close . Yeah , you 're just saying that to make me feel better . I 'm saying it ' cause I lived it . It was my first date with your mom . She was so astronomically out of my league ... a fact that her friends brought up constantly ... by the time I picked her up , I 'd psyched myself out so much , I was a total wreck . But when it was all over , guess what ? I asked her out again 'cause I knew that , no matter how much of a fool I made out of myself , in the end , it 'd be worth it . What 's the word from Outpost Three ? Still waiting . What do you mean ? Shouldn 't they have checked in ? Yes , but we 've been having communication problems out that way for the past week or so . Well , maybe you should send another team to see if they 're okay . Commander Taylor left me with very specific orders . Until he directs otherwise , Outpost Three is under general quarantine . Quarantine ? ! No , no , I spoke to my wife last night . She never used the word quarantine . If Commander Taylor hasn 't checked in by nightfall , I will consider sending another team at that time . No , no , I 'm not waiting around for that . - I 'm going out there . - That is out of the question . You will remain here , and as soon as I know anything more , you will be informed . Understood . - I need your rover . - And I need my favorite reading glasses that I left back in Boston . Elisabeth 's in trouble . What 's going on ? I don 't know , but Outpost Three is under quarantine . Ah , where do you think you 're going ? To lodge a complaint with Lieutenant Washington . All science outposts are my jurisdiction . It 's entirely unacceptable I haven 't been briefed about it . And I 'm personally offended for you , but before you go , I need the ignition code to your rover and about a ten-minute head start . No . I 'm going with you . Ah ... No , you 're not . This a medical emergency . What are you going to do without me ? Shoot them back to health ? Fine , but I 'm drive ... Oh , God , you have a cold . - I have kids . - Here . Chew on this . Huh ? I won 't have you sneezing on me the whole way . Chew it . You 'll be good for 12 hours . Oh , it tastes awful ! Yeah , I know . Scoot over . Um ... I 've been meaning to talk to you about something . Uh , remember that day , out by the falls when you showed me those calculations , or whatever they were ? Mm-hmm . Don 't you think that we should , uh tell someone ? Who ? I don 't know . I forget what I was talking about . Um ... Skye ? You know I like you . I 'd be insane not to . Just the way I left things with Kara ... the way we said good-bye ... I just , I can 't . I 'm sorry . It 's okay . I get it . Oh . You hate me now . I do not hate you , Josh . You promised Kara you 'd try to get her here . What if I told you I might know a guy who could help you with that ? The hell 's that ? Ovosaurs . Damn it . I keep telling Taylor we should sink these things deeper . It 's the nickel . It 's like catnip to them . Outpost Three , this is Terra Nova . Come in , Commander Taylor . Outpost Three , this is Terra Nova . Come in . Do you hear me ? Outpost Three , this is Terra Nova . Come in . Commander Taylor , are you there ? Commander Taylor isn 't here right now . Can I take a message ? What the hell are you doing there ? Well , uh , I 'm looking for my wife . Where 's the commander ? I don 't know yet , but I 'll let you know as soon as I find out . Good talk . Over . Hi . Elisabeth . Don 't move ! Elisabeth , it 's us . Malcolm ? Malcolm ! What the hell 's going on ? Why doesn 't she recognize me ? Okay , um ... she seems to have lost all memory of the last 20 or so years . As far as Elisabeth 's concerned , she 's in university , she and I have just started dating . Oh , terrific ... so , you 're in , the , uh , honeymoon period . - Yeah . - Yeah . Malcolm , how did this happen ? Some kind of pathogen . I looked at the notes she made before she became symptomatic . Um , the first stage of the disease is intermittent memory loss . The infected become disoriented . They can hold on , but with some effort . And they eventually do become unmoored , which leads to stage two , which is , uh , catastrophic memory loss . That could explain why we can 't find Taylor and Brady . According to Elisabeth 's notes , the final stage of the disease is full-on catatonia . Malcolm ... can you cure this thing ? With her help , I-I believe so . I mean , she 's still Elisabeth . Her cognitive mind is still functioning , and even as a student , she was amazing . We just need to bring her up to the present as fast as possible . Okay . Guess I better introduce myself . Um , actually , you know what ? It would probably be better if I do the talking . I mean , we just need to give her enough information to get her back to work . You throw a husband and kids at her right now , it 'll just confuse her . So , you 're going to tell her it 's 20 years later than she thinks it is , and she 's gone back in time 85 million years , but you think a husband 's gonna confuse her ? Look , she doesn 't remember who you are . You want to break out the family album , be my guest . - I 'm just trying to be efficient . - Fine . We 'll do it your way . Okay , uh , Elisabeth , this is Jim Shannon . He 's with security . Pleased to meet you . - Hey , Tom . - Skye . Hey , uh , you got a minute ? Yeah . Um , I told Josh you 're a man who can get things here . Well , I 've done so in the past . Or the future , I should say . People , too ? People ? People is difficult . And expensive . How expensive ? More than a kid your age could afford . Well , I 've got time to earn , and this couldn 't happen until at least the pilgrimage after next , right ? Because you would have to get a message through to 2149 , and that could only happen when the portals open . Or so Taylor says . Your the cop 's son , right ? 'Cause , uh trust is important around here , so , theoretically , if a person had secrets , would they be safe with you ? Why , are we theoretically having a job interview right now ? 85 million BC ? You people couldn 't time travel to after the Ice Age ? Uh , it 's too complicated . Okay . The important thing is that you came to this outpost and identified a pathogen that causes some kind of amnesia . And it 's affecting you , too . You don 't believe me ? Well , of course I don 't because what you 're talking about is completely ridiculous . If you don 't believe him , maybe you 'll believe yourself . The incubation period is approximately four to six hours . Early symptoms include disorientation , loss of short-term memory . It appears to involve cognitive regression to a point in the patient 's history , in their past ... I 'm so old . No , you 're not . You 're beautiful . And the disease appears to reach its third and final stage within 36 to 48 hours . It remains to be seen whether the catatonia is reversible . Okay . How long have I been here ? A little over a day . Then we need to figure this out before I get any worse and before you two start showing any symptoms . What 's happening ? Ovosaurs , chewing on power cables . Could be . All right , I 'll go chase ' em off . Brady ? Move a muscle , I 'll blow your head off . James Shannon . Terra Nova Security . What 's Terra Nova ? Huh ? This place ? Uh ... not exactly . It 's a code name , isn 't it ? Is that what you 're calling this operation , Terra Nova ? Taylor , listen to me , I don 't know when or where - you think you are ... - Save it . I know exactly where I am . Somalia . 2138 . What are you talking about ? Only question is , who 's running this mind game on me ? I know the Somalis ain 't got the tech to get inside my head like this . That means you are either Axis psi-ops , or you 're Russo-Chinese . I 'll figure it out . And then I 'll know who took her . What do you mean , her ? You mean Wash ? You 're a liar . I was there when they medevac 'd her out . There 's no way she 's in on this . Where 's Ayani ? - Where did they take her ? - Who ? My wife . My son . Taylor ... I saw those people strapped in back , the ones you 're experimenting on . You 're lucky I didn 't find my family there , and you better pray that I do find them . If I don 't , I 'm gonna come back ... and I 'm gonna slit every throat in sight . Count on it . Malcolm . Look at the DNA sequencing on this blood sample . This isn 't a pathogen we 're dealing with . Someone in this lab was experimenting with gene therapy . No , no , no , no , that 's impossible . Any research involving genetic manipulation has to be cleared through me . Well , then , so , whoever it is , is obviously trying to keep it a secret . You 're so beautiful . What ? Let 's get lost today , hmm ? - Malcolm , hey , look at me . - I am looking at you . I can 't help but look at you . This doesn 't feel right , Malcolm . Please . Yeah , Malcolm . Please . Jack ! What are you doing ? He 's been infected ! No , no , I-I 'm fine . I 'm-I 'm fine now . I-I-I just drifted , but I 'm-I 'm-I 'm okay . Where are you ? Uh , Terra Nova . Research outpost . If you can remember that , remember this . That 's my wife ... so keep your hands to yourself . What happened to you ? Uh ... I found Taylor . He 's infected . He thinks he 's in some kind of psi-ops SIM back in Somalia . I know he served there . They did some horrible psychological experiments during that war . And if that 's the last thing he remembers , then everything he 's seeing now doesn 't make much sense to him , just like it didn 't to Elisabeth when we first found her . And I got a feeling he 's trying to make his way back to Terra Nova . He 'll find it . He 's motivated ... he thinks his wife 's in danger . Whoa , whoa , whoa . If he makes it back to the colony , he 'll infect everyone . Which is why we need to warn them ... except we can 't . Com-system went out when we lost power . - You have to follow him . - No , no , no , we have to assume Jack 's been infected , too . Uh , Jim . It 's-it 's Jim . And no , I feel fine . Well , so did he five minutes ago . Have you experienced any disorientation at all since you 've been here ? Um ... no . That 's curious . The two of you were exposed at the same time , so why aren 't you showing any symptoms ? I don 't know . But Taylor did a job on that soldier Brady back there , so I 'm gonna get him to the infirmary , so you can check he 's okay . Okay , we 'll get back to work . - Okay ... - Yeah ... Actually , uh , why don 't you come give me a hand . This guy 's not small . Oh . Okay , yeah . - I 'll , um ... - Take care . - This ... ? - Yeah . Okay . Hey . Mark . Oh , I 'm so sorry . No ... I totally forgot . I wanted ... I thought that we knew that it was canceled tonight because my parents are missing and I 'm ... No , I just came to check if you were okay . Are you okay ? You know what the worst part is ? Having absolutely no idea what 's going on . All my dad said was he was going to help my mom , and then nothing from either of them . Yeah , that 's rough . It could be anything , you know ? Sixers could have ambushed them . It 's not the Sixers . Then you know what 's going on . Look , Maddy , I 'm really ... not supposed to be talking about this . Mark it 's my parents . No way . Of all the times you could have flashed back to , did it have to be when you were dating my wife ? I just saw Elizabeth in a laboratory and my mind must have filled in the rest . What do you want me to say ? Uh , that it won 't happen again . It won 't happen again . What ? Oh , my God . Who is this ? Who are you ? Oh , God , what now ? D-D-Di-Did we , uh , kill this man ? No , he 's not even dead . See ? So come on , give me a hand . I-I-I don 't want any trouble . I 'm here on a grant . Come on , just pick up his legs . Malcolm ... uh ... Malcolm , move ! Please , tell me I 'm not crazy . Hey , maybe it will just eat that soldier and go away . Stay here . What are you doing ? The nickel in the cables ! They can smell it ! - Clear the door . - What ? Get out of the way ! Go ! Go ! That is not happening . Oh , dear God , somebody help me . - Malcolm ... - What the hell were those things ? Calm down , Malcolm . What did you just do ? Uh , I ... No choice . So , where are we on this cure ? Nowhere . I mean ... I really felt like we were making some progress , but I can 't do this without Malcolm . You don 't need Malcolm . You were doing just fine before he got here . No , I was cowering in the corner with a rifle . You were confused and alone , but you 're not anymore . Do we know each other ? Yeah , we do . We come from the same place ... the future . But we 're more than just acquaintances , aren 't we ? We 're friends . Yeah , we are . Hmm . All right . Uh , okay , So we know somebody in this lab was conducting illicit gene therapy experiments . Now , if I knew who that was , I might be able to figure out what they were trying to do , and then that might help me work out how to undo it . Yeah , suspect and motive . Now you 're talking my language . Okay , so we need to start going through the staff 's personal files . Um ... how are you at computer hacking ? Uh , Maddy 's taught me a thing or two . - Maddy ? - Yeah . My daughter . Oh , you have a daughter . So , you married ? Yeah . Well , you know , it 's complicated . Isn 't it always . Okay , let 's get to hacking . Wow , I guess I get something . Whose computer terminal is it ? Dr. Douglas Joslyn . Okay , let 's bring up his medical history . Hmm ... He carries the latent gene for Gormon 's Disease . Gormon 's ... that 's kind of like Alzheimer 's , right ? Yeah , only worse . He must have been looking for a cure , trying to re-sequence the gene cluster that controls memory . The re-sequencing must have misfired , started blocking the neural pathways instead of opening them up . He must have engineered a virus to use as a delivery system , but then , that 's how it became contagious . I 'm not sure of anything anymore , and we 're running out of time . Elisabeth , you can do this . No , I 'm at 39 hours . Catatonia can set in as early as 36 . All right , so we work fast . - Okay ? - Okay . Okay ... Just give me something to do . Elisabeth ? This is my handwriting , but I don 't remember writing these and I-I-I , I don 't know who they are . But if I wrote them down , it must be because ... because they 're important to me and I was afraid I was going to forget . Josh . Maddy . That 's your daughter 's name . Zoe ... Jim . Your husband . I don 't remember . I know . But you will . What if I don 't ? What happens if we both forget ? What I feel for you is ... is more than just a memory . Anyway ... I 'm fine . Yeah , you are , aren 't you ? Why is that ? Why ? Oh , sorry . So much for 12 hours . What 's that ? Oh , it 's something Malcolm gave me for my cold . This is it . It has to be . There 's something in this that he 's given you that has a medicinal quality that blocks the pathogen . I mean , all we have to do is work out what it is . I 'm not sure this is such a good idea , Maddy . Look , nobody said that you had to come with me . Either way I 'm going in and I 'm asking Lieutenant Washington what 's going on . L-Look , what about Zoe ? Okay ? We can 't just leave her alone . How is she alone ? You posted two guards outside her bedroom . Uh , yeah , about that , if you wouldn 't mind not mentioning that to my commanding officer , I 'd really appreciate it . Lieutenant Washington ? It 's Maddy Shannon . I 'd like to speak to you . Look , Maddy ... Lieutenant Washington . - Not now , Maddy . - My parents ... Reynolds , get her out of here ... now ! - Lieutenant , a-all she ... - That was an order ! You 're not too good at following orders , are you , soldier ? You 're sick , Commander . You 've been infected with something , it 's got you confused . The war ... it 's over . Has been for a decade . We won . Don 't you lie to me , Wash . I want answers . Please ... ! You don 't want to do that , sir . He 's a soldier ; he 's one of your men . His name is Reynolds , Mark Reynolds . He came out here on the Fifth Pilgrimage . He came here because of you , because seven years ago , you led us to this place so that we could have a second chance . What is this place ? It 's home . This is home ? Yeah . All right , then where is my wife ? Show her to me . Ayani 's gone , Nathaniel . No . She died . No , you 're lying to me , Wash . You know I would never lie to you about anything . This is your place , this is your home , and you 've forgotten , that 's all , but we 're going to help you find a way to remember . Ayani 's dead . Yeah . Why would I want to remember that ? No , sir . No ! Natural antihistamines , traces of animal dung . No , there 's nothing in that root that Malcolm gave you that would account for you being immune . Animal dung ? - Yeah . - Oh . You want it back ? Oh , I 'd rather sneeze , but I don 't want to get you sick , so ... Yes , you do . - What ? - I 'm such an idiot . It 's not this root , it 's your cold . My cold ? Yeah , your virus is counteracting the one that Joslyn engineered . It 's blocking the cell receptors so the pathogen can 't get through . All I have to do is identify the serotype and we should be able to manufacture a treatment . Uh , I-I-I think I know a faster way . Mm-hmm . You feel sick yet ? Not quite yet , no . Okay , take it easy , take it easy , Commander . Can you tell me where you are ? Terra Nova . You 're going to experience some confusion , just for a few hours , while the memories sort themselves out . Based on the success we had at the outpost , you should be fine before dinner . Except for a wicked cold , right ? No , well , I created a vaccine out of an inactive virus , so you shouldn 't exhibit any symptoms . All right , we 'll let you rest . Lieutenant . Yes , sir . You shot me . I did , sir . Good job . Thank you . How are you feeling ? Hey , Elisabeth , yeah , I 'm fine , except for this headache . I must have taken a fall or something . Or something . Okay . Mr. Shannon . Don 't mind me . Hi , angel . Hi , Daddy . Feeling better ? Yeah . Yeah . What have you got here ? Dinosaurs . Dinosaurs ? Hey . Hey . Come in here and hide with us . Look what Z made . I 'm teaching them how to walk . How they doing ? Pretty well . We should enjoy this while we can . - Yeah . - Yeah . How are you , Mira ? Medicine , power cell ... No ammo ? Taylor would lock me up if he even knew I was doing business with the Sixers . If he thought I was getting you weapons , he 'd have me shot . I was able to find you more of that wild sorghum you 're so keen on . Good as gold . This stuff makes the finest hooch . Oh , uh , just one more thing . The next time you 're able to establish contact with 2149 , I need to get a message through . What 's it about ? Ah , it 's just a kid who wants to buy his girlfriend ways to the portal . Oh , you 're going soft ? The kid , is the new sheriff 's son . You mean Shannon ? That 's right . I gave this boy a job in my barn . And I keep your enemy close , you know that , But if there is a problem , I could tell him I just couldn 't work on that . It 's not a problem . It 's an opportunity . One I plan to take advantage of .

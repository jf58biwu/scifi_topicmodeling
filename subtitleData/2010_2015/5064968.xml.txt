 ( screaming ) ( BEEPlNG ) ( BEEPlNG FASTER ) ( BEEPlNG rapidly ) ( shouting ) ( gasping ) ( GRUNTlNG ) ( cracking BONE ) ( GRUNTlNG ) ( GRUNTlNG ) ( speaking spanish ) Don 't . - Calm down . - Fuck you . Calm down . Fuck you . ROYCE : Looks like his chute didn 't open . ( panting ) Single shooter . How do you know ? ( GRUNTlNG ) ( speaking russian ) Please stop doing that . You 're shooting at the wrong people . How do I know ? Because otherwise , we wouldn 't be having this conversation . All right . You wanna show me the right ones ? Nikolai . I mean , I 'm Nikolai . What 's the last thing you remember , Nikolai ? War . Yeah . I was with the Chechnya . And there was a light . And then I .. . Then I woke up and I was .. . Falling . Yeah , same thing. I was in Baja . And then there was a light . And then chingao . Where are we ? Maybe she knows . NlKOLAl : Shit . You wanna lower the weapon ? Isabelle : I 've never seen this jungle . And I 've seen most . All right , you think this is Asia ? Maybe Africa ? Too hot for this time of year . And the topography is all wrong . Amazon , maybe . I saw more parachutes . Which way ? Why ? So I can figure out who threw me out of a fucking airplane . NlKOLAl : Fuck . Where 's he going ? ( muttering ) All right , let 's hit the fucking road . ( mumbling in russian ) Fuck . ( SQUELCHlNG ) You remember a plane ? I woke up in freefall . You ? Same . You 're idf ? Yeah . Are you in the service ? Not exactly . ( SHOUTS ) You motherfucker . Come on , you motherfucker . ( GRUNTlNG ) ( groaning ) You with him ? No . ( GRUNTlNG ) Then why don 't you mind your own fucking business ? We have bigger problems right now . Okay , boss . Whatever you say . I will finish what you started . Strength in numbers , huh ? Something like that . STANS : Yeah ? Maybe we should get that guy hanging in the tree ? Help me ! Fuck ! Help me ! Somebody ! Fuck . Help ! Hello ? I 'm trapped in a parachute in a fucking tree . Hey , man , why don 't you shut the fuck up ? Oh . Thank God . I think I can .. . Stop moving . You 're breaking the branch . You have anything to cut yourself down with ? Why would I .. . No , I don 't . Isabelle : Look , if we get rope from one of the chutes .. . Do something . - edwin : Help ! - lt was taking too long . Help ! Who the hell are you ? I 'm a doctor . I was on my way to work . ( stuttering ) Can someone please just tell me , uh , what the fuck is going on here ? Your ass is awesome . Look . Goddamn . Who the hell is this guy ? STANS : What the hell is that ? Who would do this ? Whoever they are , they take trophies . In my culture the warrior with the greatest trophies commands the most respect . Whatever . It 's a test . To see how we do under pressure . If this were a test , you 'd all be military . Total strangers . Live rounds . This is something else . CUCHlLLO : Maybe it 's ransom . Back in Tijuana , we kidnap you , put you in an oil drum . The ransom 's not paid , we light you on fire . I hear these stories about these experiments they run on cons . They stick drugs in your food and they sit back and watch what happens . Well , it 's not drugs . If it was a psychotropic compound , we 'd be feeling the residual side effects . Loss of motor skills , blurry vision . And if it was a behavioral experiment .. . I mean , there .. . There 'd be a point . What if we are dead ? I was going to be executed in two days . And I was in combat . So was I . This is hell . Last time I looked , you didn 't need a parachute to get there . It doesn 't matter what happened , or why . We 're here . Only question is , how do we get out ? Where you going ? ROYCE : To high ground . We need to stick together . Then you should follow me . Uh , yeah , I wouldn 't do that . Yep . Archaefructus liaoningensis . That is really , really poisonous . Wouldn 't take more than one scratch to cause total paralysis . Thank you. I 'll watch for you out here . You made a buddy . Isabelle : Hey . We need to rest . So rest . You look like you could use it , too . You got a name ? Look . I 'm sorry . You want to play scout leader , great . All right ? You wanna follow me , fine . But I 'm not doing this . I 'm better on my own . Wanna see something fucked up ? Well , between that and the sun , I 'd say we have a real problem . What about the sun ? Hasn 't moved since we got here . What do you think is really going on ? What do I think ? Spetsnaz . Alpha Group . Los Zetas , cartel enforcer . RUF . It 's a death squad from Sierra Leone . Yakuza , lnagawa-kai . And the fbi 's Most Wanted . And him . They 're all heavy-hitters . He doesn 't belong . Belong to what ? I 'd say we were chosen . What about you ? What about me ? You know the jungle . Know the players . I 'm guessing ex-military . Black ops . Probably a mercenary . You got a problem with that ? Not at the moment . Good . ( GUN clicking ) Isabelle : Something was dropped here . Same as us . Not the same as us . Isabelle : You said we were chosen . Chosen for what ? Oh , shit . Looking good there , boss . ( ROPE sliding ) ( TRAPS springing ) - STANS : Look out ! - Down ! ( yelling ) Shit ! ( SHOUTS ) ( yelling ) ( GRUNTlNG ) Isabelle : Help ! Shit . ( GRUNTlNG ) Damn it . Damn it . ( GRUNTlNG ) ( GRUNTS ) 12 o 'clock . 1 10 meters . Take him . Take him . I don 't have to . Don 't have to . We triggered a dead man 's trap . It 's two weeks , judging from the rate of decomposition . He took up a position here . Shooting in all directions . This was a last stand . United States Special Forces . This is strange . He is supposed to be deployed in Afghanistan . What 's he doing here , setting traps for us ? They weren 't meant for us . He was hunting something else . Something a lot bigger . Bigger ? The trunk was a deadfall . Rule of thumb with a deadfall is you set the weight five times that of the target animal . Whatever it was , it got through the trip wires . And it did this . ROYCE : Let 's move . What is it ? PREDATOR : What is it ? Nothing . PREDATOR : What is it ? Nothing . Nothing . Nothing . We 're gonna need a new plan . Where are we going ? Someone put us on this rock . There 's got to be a way off it . ( EX claims ) What the fuck ? ( SWOOPlNG ) You know what ? Fuck this . This is bullshit , man . I want a gun . Come on , man , you got two motherfucking guns , man . Somebody give me a gun . Come on , Russian . You got a big fucking gun . Come on , man . Give me a gun . Give me your gun . Right now . ( COCKlNG GUN ) Give me your gun . ( GRUNTS ) I 'm ready to die . Are you ? ( GROWLlNG ) ( speaking spanish ) ( EX claims ) ( GROWLlNG ) ( STANS shouting ) Oh . edwin : Help ! ( GROWLlNG ) Oh , shit ! Oh , shit ! Oh . Shit ! Fuck ! ( GROWLlNG ) ( EDWlN SHOUTS ) ( NlKOLAl screaming ) ( gasping ) ( shouting ) Help ! ( GRUNTlNG ) Fuck you ! Fuck you ! ( GROWLlNG ) Looking good there , boss . ( panting ) ( GROWLlNG ) ( shouting ) Go ! Go ! Come on . Come on . ( GRUNTlNG ) ( GUN clicks ) Oh , shit ! ( GROWLlNG ) ( GRUNTlNG ) Come on ! No ! ( HlGH-PlTCHED whistling ) ( GROWLlNG ) ( roaring ) ( whistling continues ) ( GROWLlNG SOFTLY ) ( gasping ) ( GRUNTlNG ) MOMBASA : As bad as you are , those things are worse . ( muttering ) So they .. . They just , what , left ? Isabelle : No . The whistle . They were called . All right , listen up . Everybody do a shell count . We got to conserve ammunition . Reload . Do it now . Excuse me . Just what the hell is going on here ? We 're being hunted . The cages . The soldier . All of us . All brought here for the same purpose . This planet is a game preserve . And we 're the game . In case you didn 't notice , we just got flushed out . They sent the dogs in , just like you would if you were stalking boar or shooting quail . They split us apart and they watched . Testing us . How do you know this ? Because that 's what I would do . Fantastic . Wait . There are only seven of us . CUCHlLLO : Help me ! Help ! ( WEAKLY ) Help . - Wait . - What ? It 's a trap . CUCHlLLO : Help me . Fuck me . CUCHlLLO : Help . MOMBASA : Wound one man . Make him suffer . Make him bleed . Make him call out for help , and set a trap and kill those who come . I know because I have done this . So we 're gonna leave him here , right ? Come on , look at him . He 's done . There 's nothing else we can do , right ? Right ? We leave him . I can 't . Then , that 's on you . CUCHlLLO : Help me . PREDATOR : ( imitating CUCHlLLO ) Help me . PREDATOR : Help me . Help me . ( voice fluctuating ) lt 's a trap. lt 's a trap. lt 's a trap . What are we gonna do ? We should go to higher ground . Really ? We 're trapped on an alien hunting planet . You really think the solution is to walk more ? ( sniffing ) lt wants us to run . That 's how it hunts . This is its jungle . Its game . Its rules . We run , we die . Isabelle : What 's the alternative ? We need to know who we 're dealing with . Dog tracks go that way . We go after it . ROYCE : Well ? No movement . ( GASPS ) ( wings fluttering ) STANS : It looks like we 're not the only things being hunted . ( roaring ) Holy shit ! STANS : What the fuck ? What the fuck is that thing ? This is a mistake . We have to leave . Now . Where is the tough guy ? Isabelle : He left us . He 's here . ( SHOT firing ) ( screaming ) Run ! ( shouting ) ( PREDATOR roaring ) ( GURGLlNG ) ( screaming ) - ( yelling ) - ( roaring ) ( GASPS ) ( roaring ) ( yelling ) ROYCE : Run ! Run ! Run ! ( screaming ) ( panting ) ( screaming ) ( SNARLlNG ) ( ALL panting ) ( groaning ) You set us up . He led us into that death camp , then hid and waited for that thing to strike . We were bait . I needed to know who we were up against . Now I do . A man is dead because of that . This morning you were ready to kill him . It ain 't this goddamn morning , is it ? At least he didn 't die in vain . Why ? So we could find out firsthand what it feels like to have our asses kicked ? No . We found out that there 's more than one of them . That they use projectile and energy-based weapons . That they have some sort of cloaking device . That they 're bigger than us , stronger , but also heavier . You put us at risk for yourself . You want to be on your own , you got it . Why don 't you tell them the truth ? - l don 't know what you 're talking about . - You know what I 'm talking about . The way you looked at that thing that was strung up , the way you reacted . She knows what it is . Don 't you ? We don 't have a name for them . '87 , Guatemala . A spec ops team went into the jungle . High end . Six men plus a cla liaison . Only one made it out . In his debrief , he said they came in contact with something . He gave a detailed description . The thing on the totem . It wore some kind of camouflage that adjusted to ambient light . Made it nearly invisible in our spectrum . It could see in infrared . Heat signatures . He used mud to block his . That 's how he beat it . It hunted and killed his team , one by one . Whatever it is , wherever they 're from , we 're going to kill them all . We set up a defensive perimeter . Make it look like we are holing up . That 'll bring them to us . We force them into a choke point . We get them in overlapping fields of fire . It can be done . I can 't do it alone . You know , man , if we ever make it home , I 'm gonna do so much fucking cocaine . I 'm gonna rape so many fine bitches . I 'll be like , " What time is it ? 5 : 00 ? " Damn . " Time to go rape me some fine bitches . " You know what I 'm saying ? Oh , yeah . Totally . Like , 5 : 00 , it 's bitch-raping time . Mmm . Yeah . - You should stay away from him . - Yeah . You still pissed ? Fuck you . ( chuckling ) You know what the difference between you and me is ? We both do the same thing . You just do it for a country , so you don 't have to admit you like it . What happened to you ? What made you so fucked up ? " There is no hunting like the hunting of a man . " And those who 've hunted armed men long enough , " and like it , " never really care for anything else thereafter . " That 's pretty poetic . Did you come up with that all by yourself ? No , actually . That was Hemingway . ( LEAVES rustling ) ( whispers ) Fuck . Why isn 't it coming ? They see our traps . Hey , Doc . Hey . I think I just figured out a way you can be useful . Shit . Shit . I hate this. I hate this. I hate this . Oh ! Come on . Come on . Come on . Oh , shit ! Come on . Come on . Fucking shoot ! Shoot already ! Fuck all of you ! is he dead ? Why ain 't you smiling ? Oh , shit . NlKOLAl : The thing from the cages . Maybe it thought we 're the ones who dropped it here . ROYCE : Good shot , though . I missed . MAN : ( whispering ) Over here . Over here . ( gasping ) Over here . ( WEAPON activating ) Turn around . What the fuck are you ? I 'm alive . ( GASPS ) You talk too loud . ( lNHALES DEEPLY ) Smelled you since you got here . If I can smell you , if I can hear you , they can , too . ( THUNDER rumbling ) Storm coming soon . This way . Isabelle : Wait . Who are you ? ( lN SlNG-SONG voice ) Noland , run away , live to fight another day . I 'm the one that got away . The one you don 't fuck with . Come on . Feel the vibe of this place . Isabelle : Where are we ? NOLAND : It 's a drill somebody left behind . The machine is dead , but the power source ain 't . ( machinery WHlRRlNG ) ( GRUNTlNG ) STANS : Wow , what a shithole . You live here ? Oh , no . No . This is my summer home . I winter in the Riviera . The schools are so much nicer there . And the men .. . Ooh , la , la ! By the way , you 're welcome . How have you survived ? Salvaging what I can , when I can , from whatever I can . Oh . Noland , Ronald . Air Cav . They .. . ( chuckling ) They drop you all in , too ? Yeah . Hmm . ( chuckling ) What a rush . ( humming ride OF THE valkyries ) Hey . Yeah , I 'll tell him . Hey , Agent Orange , you wanna put that down ? Certain people around here are particular about other people messing with their shit . Very important , though . Disrupts the heat signature . You motherfuckers . So , you killed one ? Uh-uh . I killed two . Maybe three . I can 't remember . Anyway , there 's two different types of them out there . Hmm ? Now they 're similar , but they 're different . It 's kind of like the difference between dogs and wolves . The ones that are running things up there , the larger ones , hunt the smaller ones . It 's some kind of blood feud , I guess . Been going on for a long time . ( mumbling ) They do this just for sport ? Oh , yeah , they bring in fresh meat season after season . I mean , shit you wouldn 't believe . Bring it in , and hunt it and kill it. ln that order . How long you been here , man ? Uh .. . Seven seasons , I think . What ? Ten ? Damn . Anyway , every once in a while , one of us kills one of them . And , let me tell you , that 's when they get real interested . See , they learn quick . They adapt . They develop a whole new set of skills . They come back the next season in threes , always in threes . Their armor might 've changed , or their weapons have changed , or their tactics have changed . It 's amazing . So , it 's like evolution . They 're trying to make themselves into better killers . Mmm-hmm . You said they come back . How ? They got a ship . - A ship ? - Yeah . It 's 30 yards from their camp . ( chuckling ) I told you they wouldn 't see it . I told you they wouldn 't . You were there . You could 've helped us . How do we kill them ? However you can . They must have a weakness . Not many . You want to survive ? You dig in deep . You stay hid . Yeah , well , we 're gonna go with door number two . How do we get out of this valley ? Oh . Ten seasons . First two seasons .. . No , three seasons I was here , I was walking in the same direction , trying to reach the edge of the preserve . ( laughing ) Let me tell you something , there ain 't no edge of the preserve . Maybe you and your friend wanna tell me about that ship ? Let 's see . That 's a brilliant idea . Brilliant . The whole time I 've been here , it never occurred to me to commandeer the alien spacecraft . But I wouldn 't know how to fly it . He would . Of course , you know how to fly . I 'll give it a shot . ( NOLAND laughing ) Well .. . I 'm gonna get some sleep . No noise . They 're out there . They 're always out there . Water in there . Help yourself . All of you . Who 's that ? My kids . Big one , Ilya . And that 's Sascha . ( speaking russian ) Uh .. . ( GRUNTlNG ) This is , uh , Candy Lee . Tits like howitzers . is that your girlfriend ? No. lt 's my sister . ( speaking JAPANESE ) This is old . Very old . They 've been doing this for a long time . You speak English . Yes . Why don 't you say more ? Because I talk too much . ( BOTH chuckling ) ( GRUNTS ) Thanks . Do you know what I was doing when I was taken ? Isaac , my spotter . He was caught . I could have done something , but then I would have been slaughtered along with him . So , I hid . I watched him die . I wish I pulled that trigger . You do what you have to , to survive . You said we were chosen . I asked , " For what ? " I should 've asked why . It 's because we are predators . Just like them . We 're the monsters of our own world . It 's probably better that we 're never going back . I am going back . I 'm going after that ship . You learn how to fly it in the last hour and not tell me ? No . That thing strung up at the camp might know . My guess is , it 'd do just about anything to get free . Enemy of my enemy . That doesn 't make it a friend . So what do I call you ? ( sniffing ) Smoke . Hey , smoke . Fuck . ( EX claims ) Where 's Noland ? ( coughing ) He 's a scavenger . He wants what we have . Isabelle : Come on ! There must be a way out ! ROYCE : Damn it . Isabelle : Do it ! You see the shit you 've gotten us into , man ? NOLAND : I told you that . You never listen to me , though . Six more . Six more fucking mouths to feed . I can barely stand living with you . How am I gonna live with them , too ? Isabelle : Damn it ! What ? Say goodbye to your little friend . You 're in my house , motherfucker ! Get down . Yeah , that didn 't open up shit . Wasn 't meant to , asshole . I 'm calling in the cavalry . ( GROWLlNG ) STANS : How the fuck can we get out of here ? Open up , you hanky fucker . Isabelle : Come on ! ( PREDATOR growling ) Oh . - ( WEAPON powering UP ) - Finally found me , huh , big dog ? Well , what took you so long ? STANS : It 's not gonna open ! ( STANS shouting ) God damn it ! ( pounding AT DOOR ) ( YELLS ) ( banging ON DOOR ) ( air hissing ) It 's toying with us . edwin : Guys ? Oh , shit . Hey !

He 's done . You 're gonna beg us to slow down . - No , no , no . - To carry you . You can 't leave me here . You can 't. I have a family . I got kids . I 'm sorry . ( EX claims SOFTLY ) We need to go . No . No ! You are taking me with you ! Look , you and I can still make it . We use him . We booby-trap him . No . They 'll go to him to take trophies . This is our last chance . This isn 't right . He 's one of us ! He is . That 's what they 're counting on . They want you to feel something for this man . To be human . And what are you ? Alive . What 's that worth ? edwin : ( crying ) You can 't . Please . Please , I 'm begging you . Please . You should go . ( SOFTLY ) Shit . ( EDWlN MURMURlNG ) - You should 've gone with him . - l know .

( lN NORMAL voice ) Oh ! You came back . I missed my ride . Oh , thank God . Help us get out of here . ( GRUNTlNG ) She 's paralyzed . It gave her something.

 Who is this guy ? What is he doing ? He 's watching , which is why we refer to him as the observer . Previously on fringe ... That 's a different guy . Who are these people ? I think these guys show up at important moments . You were dead , Peter . We were drowning and he dove in . We were saved , both of us , by a man that I had never met . The boy is important . He has to live . I have said too much . I 'm not supposed to get involved . It appears you 've been busy . You have changed the future . You need to restore balance . How ? You will have an opportunity to fix this . Please don 't take my son . Walter ? Peter . You 're up early . Oh , no , I 'm still asleep upstairs in my bed . You 're just talking to an astral projection of me . You 're just saying that to see if I 'm high . What are you doing , Walter ? I 'm making myself smarter . Really ? When William removed those parts of my brain all those years ago , he diminished my intellect . And now , I 'm not the equal of my equal . Your equal ? Walternate . If I can think like him , I can figure out what he 's trying to do with that device and how to keep you safe . Walter . Hmm ? You really sure you should be dabbling in that ? I 've done hundreds of experiments on myself . No . That 's not what I meant , Walter . According to William bell , he took out those parts of your brain for a reason . Because you asked him to . Because you were afraid of what you were becoming . I don 't wanna see you hurt yourself . I won 't hurt myself . Ooh . [ Doorbell rings ] Ahh ... Who 's that at 2 : 00 in the morning ? Oh ! My pizza . So you are high , then . Maybe a bit . We 've got a live one . ( Pam ) That 's Mr. Joyce . He 's a sleepwalker . [ Alarm buzzes ] ( Joe ) Open door in the patient wing . Who is that ? Come on . ( Pam ) Mr. Joyce . Are you awake ? Mr. Joyce . Who were you talking to ? That boy . Where did he go ? I was talking to ... Bobby . Bobby ? Now , he definitely wasn 't talking to Bobby . Who 's Bobby ? It 's Mr. Joyce 's son . He died in 1985 . What did he say to you ? Did you tell him ? What now ? I take you back home . Sync by jacobian @ HDbits.org for Web-DL ebp [ Knock at door ] Olivia Dunham ? Yeah . Thank you . [ Telephone rings ] [ Ringing ] [ Beep ] Dunham . Hey . Hey . What 's up ? Broyles was just telling us a ghost story . Bobby Joyce . He 's the son of one of the residents here . Or rather , he was . He died 25 years ago . And it gets more odd . The cameras picked up this as well . The observer ? It 's been a while since we 've seen him . Agent Broyles ? You comin ' , Walter ? Yes , of course . ( Pam ) After I took a second look at the video , I knew who it was right away . Mr. Joyce keeps a photo of Bobby on his bedside table . I been looking at it ever since I worked here . Did Mr. Joyce say what it was that he and Bobby were talking about ? He doesn 't remember . He was sleepwalking . That 's Mr. Joyce . Roscoe Joyce ! You know him ? Mr. Joyce ! Mr ... Mr. Joyce . I 'm Walter bishop ! I 'm a tremendous fan ! Nice to meet you . You ever heard of Violet sedan chair ? No . It 's Walter 's favorite band . Roscoe Joyce is their keyboardist . He 's a hero of Walter 's . He 's up there with Einstein and tesla . Uh ... Mr. Joyce , I 'm agent Olivia Dunham . Hi . I understand that you had a visitor last night . My son . I don 't remember talking to him . But I remember he was here . It 's a curse , not ... Remembering a miracle . It was a miracle seeing him again . Can you imagine what that 's like ? Yes , I can . Mr. Joyce ? ( Nurse ) I 'm sorry . It 's time for his physical therapy and his medication . Ready , Mr. Joyce ? One , two ... Three . I 've come to believe in some strange things , but ghosts ... Bobby wasn 't a ghost . The observer doesn 't experience time like we do . If we can accept that he can travel from the past to the present and back to the past again , then it 's not inconceivable that he could bring others with him . We 'll have to try and help Mr. Joyce remember what his son said to him . I 'll need to take him back to my lab . But why would the observer drag a dead man 25 years through time just to talk with his father ? I don 't know . But every time the observer shows up , it has something to do with you . And every time , it 's something bad . Walter , come on , you ... I 'll go wait in the car . I 'll make the arrangements to have Mr. Joyce released . Three pills at 8 : 00 this evening , and he gets a little cranky if he doesn 't eat . [ Laughs ] That 's all right . [ Pills rattle ] I got experience with cranky . Thank you . Mm-hmm . Have a good one . That 's sweet . Yeah , it is . Uh , I don 't think that this was for me . It arrived this morning , and I looked at the date on the order , and it was from when I was over there . So I figured that it was probably for her . Olivia ... it 's okay . I understand you 're gonna help me remember what my son said to me . We 're gonna try . I 'm almost done here . You guys finished out front ? Unh ! Aah ! [ Device dialing ] I 'm at 719 Skelton Avenue . There has been a robbery . [ Woman wheezing ] [ Gasping ] Help me . [ Wheezing ] [ Air hisses ] Thank you . Walter ? Where do you want this ? Uh , r-r-right ... There ! Very good . Thanks , fellas . What 's he listening to ? Ocean waves . I need him to be in a peaceful state of mind for the hypnotherapy to take full effect . Once he 's in a more pliable state , he may be able to access his memories . That 's a good look , Walter . These were created by an old friend of mine , Dr. Jacoby from Washington state . They will enable me to see Roscoe 's aura so that I can measure the depth of his hypnotic state . And the piano ? Roscoe 's mind doesn 't work like ours . His creativity is expressed through music . Playing may help him to recollect the conversation he had with his son . And if you just happen to get a private concert from your musical idol ... That 's not why I 'm doing this . But I cannot deny that I would enjoy it . Mr. Joyce ? We 're ready for you . What do you want me to do ? Let me guide you . Listen to my voice . I will speak into the microphone . Now , imagine yourself ... Somewhere tranquil , serene , safe . Go down the staircase ... So there 's no footage at all ? Okay , well , thank you for checking . I thought maybe the traffic cameras would have picked up the observer , but no such luck . How 's it going out there ? Uh , Walter 's channeling the amazing Kreskin . I just wanted to try and explain the book . You don 't have to . She asked me what my favorite book was . I understand that she was probably just trying to gather information on me , but ... I also know that I 'm not the easiest guy to get to know . It 's always been easier for me to ... Keep people at arm 's length ... Which is actually something that I think we have in common . The book wasn 't meant for her . It was meant for the Olivia Dunham that I 've spent the last couple years of my life with . Because I wanted you to read it . You 're the person I wanted to share it with . You know , I feel like rip van winkle . Everything is different . Even you opening up to me is different . And this book is just a reminder of all the things that I missed , conversations we didn 't have ... [ Footsteps ] You guys should come see this . Walter 's doing it . Sit . At the count of three , you will open your eyes , but you won 't be awake . You 'll still be open and receptive as you are now . Are you ready ? One ... Two , three . Ohh ... Ha ha . It 's been a long time since I touched a piano . [ Plays chord ] ♪ ♪ [ Melancholy tune ] ♪ ♪ Roscoe , I want you to think back . [ Continues playing ] The night you saw Bobby . Tuesday ...

( Olivia ) Go it . I 'm on my way . The observer 's been spotted in Brookline , so ... Walter , you all right ? If all right means despondent , yes . Peter , go . I 'll take care of him . Walter , I 'm sorry ! [ Footsteps , door closes ] He was in a ... Brown shirt . Who was ? Bobby . His mother gave it to him . What did Bobby tell you ? He told me ... I would ... Meet you . Walter ... Bishop . He called you by name . Bobby said I was supposed to ... Help you . Help me . How ? I don 't know . Don 't you ? It has begun . I have set everything in motion . I have watched Dr. bishop as long as you have , perhaps not as closely , but I think you 're wrong . He won 't do it . I disagree . I believe he has changed . [ Truck door opens ] [ Alarm chirps ] You think he has changed . I don 't believe he has . In either case , I suppose we will find out soon enough . [ Engine turns ] [ Playing mellow rock ] ♪ ♪ Are you sure you don 't know what I 'm supposed to do for ya ? No idea . Bobby told me to help you . You already have . Just hearing you play , I ... I feel like I 'm a teenager again . ♪ ♪ Can I ask you something , Roscoe ? [ Stops playing ] Why did Violet sedan chair break up ? I don 't know . It just happened . We were having creative differences . We figured the best thing to do was to take a break , give the band time to regroup . One day , I looked up ... And a couple of years had gone by . I barely touched the keyboard . And then a couple more . Eventually ... It just seemed easier not to . [ Resumes playing ] I suppose that that 's hard to understand . No . I spent years away from the things I loved . I 've been trying to get back into the swing of it ever since . [ Continues playing ] I was having an asthma attack . It was like he saw what I needed . He got my inhaler from my purse . Did he say anything to you ? No . Nothing . It was like nothing affected him . He had this calmness . I didn 't even think he was real , except ... He saved my life . So ... What ... what is all this you got here , huh ? Recently , I invented a liquid base to aid in the process of brain-mapping . Ha . Really ? Brain-mapping . That 's a good name for an album . Any chance you could explain that to a simpleton like me ? I don 't want to bore you with the details , but I 'm missing parts of my brain . And I have to rejuvenate them in order to rise to the intellectual challenges before me . And they are ? Discovering why your son Bobby left the message ... And how to keep my son Peter from the peril surrounding him . Is that ... Milk ? The milk acts as a bonding agent for the other compounds . Oh ... A-and helps disguise the taste . I don 't see how I can help you in any way . My knowledge of science begins and ends with inventing a recipe for a ... Strawberry milk shake . You like strawberry milk shake ? They 're my number one drink since I stopped drinking . It 's mine too ! Ashram ! Come out here , please . Walter , what is it ? I need you to go to the grocery store . Walter ... We need a gallon of strawberry ice cream , some sweet whey , and some yeast and some sugar . Okay . We need coffee anyway . Thank you , dear . [ Door closes ] I spent six years perfecting my recipe . You must try it ! Well ... Ha . To answers . [ Door opens ] Oh , did you forget something ? I hope they didn 't run out of sweet whey . Hello , Walter . We need to speak . You call it ... Autumn . Is that right ? Lovely word . We had a deal . Please ... Don 't take him from me . The drawing . Peter in the device . You know the future . Tell me how I can save my son from dying . There are things that I know . But there are things that I do not . Various possible futures are happening simultaneously . I can tell you all of them , but I cannot tell you which one of them will come to pass . Because every action causes ripples , consequences both obvious and ... Unforeseen . For instance ... After I pulled you and Peter from the icy lake , later that summer , Peter caught a firefly . I could not have known he would do that or that because he did a young girl three Miles away would not . And so later that night , she would continue looking , trying to find another one . I could not have known that when she did not come home , her father would go out looking for her , driving in the rain , so that when the traffic light turned red , his truck skidded through the intersection at Harvard yard , killing a pedestrian . Did that happen ? You and I have interfered with the natural course of events . We have upset the balance in ways I could not have predicted . Which is why now I need your help . Help ? When the time comes , give him the keys and save the girl . Give him the keys ? W-wha ... what do you mean ? What girl ? You should answer your phone . [ Cell phone rings ] [ Beep ] Hello ? ( Peter ) Apparently , your friend is fighting crimes now . Friend ? The observer . Broke up a robbery at a jewelry store . Three guys came in , killed the owner , tied up the girl who worked here . Girl ? Yeah , according to her , the observer saved her life . Who is she , the girl ? Her name 's Victoria Dimiro . Why ? I-I-I need to speak to her . Bring her here . Walter ... please don 't argue with me , Peter . This is important . I need to speak with her . Fine . But you 'll have to wait . Cops are about to take her downtown so she can give a statement . Well , as soon as they 're done , bring her here to me . Ah ! There you are . I have several things to tell you . First ... Miss Farnsworth is back . [ Chuckles ] And , uh , and I ... Remember something else . Oh ? Bobby ... Called me on the phone . Just now ? Oh , no , no . Ha ha . No . Years ago . We were on tour , and he called to tell me about a strange dream he 'd just had . He dreamt a bald man in a dark suit took him to see me . I was an old man living in a nursing home . Dreamin ' about something that happens ... 25 years later . I don 't think it was a dream at all . I think ... The man in the suit took your son through time . And it was only just last night that you caught up to the other end of the visit . Mm . Wild . [ Chuckles ] You know , come to think of it , that was the last conversation we had . Him ... Telling me about his dream . We were playing a show that night , a club in Harvard yard . Bobby ... Was on his way to the show . I remember looking outside and seeing how hard it was raining . I remember getting a call from the police . They told me ... He stepped onto the crosswalk ... When a truck ... skidded through the traffic light . They said it was ... wasn 't anybody 's fault . When I lost my son ... Nothing seemed to matter anymore . That 's the reason I broke up the band . But here I am . I played again . It felt good . It felt right . Maybe that 's why Bobby came back . Maybe it was . Would you excuse me for a moment ? Hey . Peter called . He wanted me to let you know that they are on their way back , and they 're bringing the salesgirl with them . Walter , what is it ? I know what the observer 's doing . Okay . The day I crossed over and saved Peter , I set off a chain reaction . I set the universe off-balance . Two of them . I 've seen the damage with my own eyes , but ... It 's not enough . It ... it 's not enough to understand the suffering I 've caused . Walter , we have been over this . You couldn 't have known . That 's exactly the point ... unforeseen consequences . But my fault , just the same . And that man ... Has lost a son because I was unwilling to lose mine . I know the observer is trying to restore balance , and he wants me to help him , to ... to help undo all the damage I 've caused , but I can 't do it . Don 't you see ? Doing that , I would lose him all over again . Lose who ? Peter ! Walter ... I need a phone ! [ Cell phone rings ] [ Beep ] Hello . A-ask that salesgirl a question for me . Where was she in 1985 ? I can 't do that , Walter . She 's in the car in front of us . But we 're just passing through Porter square . We should be there in about five minutes . You can ask her all the questions you like then ... [ tires screeching ] Peter ? ( Walter ) Peter ? Peter , what is it ? You check the other car . I 'll go after him . Peter , what 's happening ? ( Peter ) The observer ran into the cop car . Peter , are you all right ? Get on the dispatch . We 're gonna need an ambulance . Peter ! I gotta go ! I gotta go ! Where 's your , uh , your inhaler ? [ Wheezing ] No . It 's not in there . The bald man in the store ... He took it . Put your arms around my neck . [ Wheezing ] Excuse me ! FBI ! Move ! Try to calm down . You 're gonna be all right . Peter , are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine , but she 's not . ( Astrid ) What 's wrong with her ? She 's asthmatic . The adrenaline from the crash ... elevated her heart rate and triggered an attack . Exactly . There 's an ambulance on the way , okay ? Where are you going ? Olivia took off after the observer on foot . I 'm gonna catch up . Hey , gimme the keys , and save the girl . What did you say ? I said gimme the keys and save the girl . He told me you 'd say that . Who ? The observer . This is it ! This is his plan . This is what he wanted . You spoke with the observer ? Yes ! He is course correcting . I don 't know how , but he 's done some kind of ... A chain reaction that started from the moment that we walked into that nursing home to meet Roscoe . Everything since has been the sequence culminating in this very moment , and if I save this woman and let you go , then I 'm afraid the consequences ... You 're gonna die , Peter . They 're gonna take you from me . Walter , you can 't predict the future , and neither can I. But if you don 't help that girl right now , she 's gonna die in the street ... do you hear me ? They 'll take you from me . Walter , give me the keys . Give me the keys , Walter . Excuse me ! Out of my way ! Move ! FBI ! Coming through ! Excuse me ! [ Beep ] [ Line ringing ] Yeah . I 'm on state street . I 've lost him . ( Peter ) I got him . He 's headed into a hostel at 119 main street . ( Olivia ) Okay . I 'm on my way . [ Car horn blasts , tires squeal ] Hey ! [ Horns honking ] [ Tires squeal ] [ Exhales ] ( Astrid ) Walter , she 's getting worse ! Now , here , I-I want you to lay down , please , so we can help you ... lay down . Astrid , would you put your hands either side of her ribs , please ? [ Wheezing ] It 's all right . When I tell you , I want you to push up , applying constant pressure . Okay . I am going to use this plastic bottle to push air into your lungs . Will you hold your nose , please ? Okay , good . Are you ready ? Push . What is this all about ? You know , don 't you ? The picture of me and the device ... what does it mean ? What 's gonna happen to me ? It must be very difficult . What ? Being a father . Oof ! Unh ! [ Door opens ] Hey ! [ Peter moaning ] You need to keep her calm to prevent another attack . Thank you . [ Cell phone rings ] [ Beep ] H-hello ? Walter , we lost him . Peter ? No , Walter , the observer . Peter 's fine . He 's just a bit banged up , that 's all . Why would you think we lost Peter ? Is Peter okay ? Yes . It doesn 't make sense . Why would the observer do all this ? Home . It was a pleasure to meet you , Kelly . You too , Roscoe . I don 't know what to say . Come visit me sometime . Bring me a strawberry milk shake . I 'll play some piano for ya . It would be an honor . I forgot what my son felt like , what he smelled like . How it felt to be around him . But now I remember . Nobody is supposed to have a second chance like that . First he saves the girl , then he tries to kill her . Then he runs up five flights of stairs just to shoot me with his magic air gun and disappear . None of it makes any sense . And how is this different to any other day ? [ Groans ] Uh ... Peter , are you sure you don 't wanna go see a doctor ? No , I 'm okay . Thanks . You ever feel like every time we get close to getting the answers , somebody changes the question ? Olivia . So why is this your favorite book ? Because it talks about not depending on other people for answers . That you can only find the answers inside yourself . Which ... Given our current situation , is kind of amusing if you think about it . [ Pills rattle ] Oh ... Unh ! Peter ? Peter ! [ Cell phone rings ] [ Beep ] Hello . Walter bishop . ( Olivia ) Walter , Peter 's collapsed . He 's having some kind of a seizure . He took some aspirins and swallowed it with some milk ... milk ? Yeah , from the refrigerator . Oh , God ! Oh , God what ? The organometals I-in the serum must have reacted w-with the phosphates in the milk . Walter , what do I do ? He needs an anticoagulant to stop the seizures . In my medical bag on the shelf near the centrifuge . Okay , I got it ... you 'll also need the gallon jug of saline , which is on the bottom shelf . Open the bag ... you 'll find a bottle of magnesium sulfate . Use the syringe . 1 cc of magnesium sulfate , 9 ccs o-of saline . It 's not here , Walter , the magnesium sulfate . I can 't find it . Oh , w ... no , no , no , I moved it , so ... So I-I 'd know where I put it . It was such an obvious place ... please , Walter ! Oh ! Yeah ! I-I alphabetized it . I-it 's in the refrigerator next to the mayonnaise . Okay . I got it . Quickly ... okay , Walter . Where do I put it ? In his leg . In his right leg . Olivia ? Please tell me what 's happening .

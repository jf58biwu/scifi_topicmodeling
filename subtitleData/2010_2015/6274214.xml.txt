Total urban myth , by the way . I guarantee you , I leave this thing on , this plane is not going to crash . So , why did they say it then ? That 's the man trying to keep us down , controlling our thoughts . Duh ... Duh ... Yes , ma 'am . Vista Pacific 7500 . You are clear for takeoff on runway 2-8-Right . Engage thrust mode . 80 knots . She 's a beautiful little girl . She had blond hair and blue eyes . She lived in a castle , see ? The Captain has turned off the seat belt sign . So feel free to move about the cabin . However , we do recommend , when seated , to keep your seat belt securely fastened , in case of any unexpected turbulence . See ? Urban myth . What if you had killed us all ? But I didn 't . What 's with the phone stash ? I can score a hundred bucks each for one of these , you need one ? Oh , no , I don 't need a stolen cellphone , thank you . Hey . Times are tough , sister . Look around ! There 's a global financial crisis . Boomers screwed the pooch , man . They ain 't helping out Gen Y. Gotta make a living somehow . Surfing ain 't free .

Oh , I didn 't realize , you 're also married . Look at our rings , did I show you my ... well , mine is a little bigger , but they 're both so pretty . Have you seen 16I ? Oh , yeah , he 's eating his way through our pretzel supply . - Hey Jackie , can you get two more bottles of champagne ? - Okay . What about row 11 , miserable married couple . They haven 't said a word the entire flight . They hate each other 's guts . Do you think she married for passion , or do you think he was her safe choice ? Uh ... he grazed my ass twice already , - so , I think , wrong choice . - Eww ... And then we have ' Bridezilla ' at 16-F . She won 't quit with the wedding photos .

Here . Look at me ! Hey , look at me ! Look at me ! Look at me ! Squeeze my hand for " Yes " . Okay ? Do you have chest pain ? Are you epileptic ? - Diabetic ? Asthma ? - No ... - Pulse is 90 . - Take a breath . Deep breath . Okay . Everything 's fine . No . I don 't wanna die on a plane , please , please , please ... Breathe ! Breathe in ! Breathe in ! - Oh , no ! - Look ! Grab him ! What 's happening ? Hey , sir . - He 's not breathing . - What do we do ? Take him to the galley . Three , two , one , go . All right ... Got him ? - You got an AED ? - Yeah . - Get it ! I 'll do compressions , you do mouth to mouth . Okay . - Analyzing heart rhythm . - Clear . - Analyzing ... begin CPR - Again ! 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ... and breathe . 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , breathe . Stay clear ! Come on . - He 's gone . - No . No . He 's gone . - Dude just died . - What ? San Francisco Radio , confirming name of deceased passenger . Lance Morrell . Travelling alone . Seat 17C . There 's not a chance of resuscitation where it 's deemed landing as unnecessary and dangerous . Roger that , Vista Pacific 7500 . What are your intentions ? Continue with the flight plan , as filed . Roger that , Vista Pacific 7500 Heavy . We 'll have a medical team waiting for you at Haneda . Understand . How many passengers saw what happened ? Umm , 11 through 18 , in Economy , I don 't know about the rest , the curtains were closed . Okay . That 's good . So if anyone asks , just say a passenger is ill . We 're gonna go lights out throughout the night till Tokyo . Wouldn 't cause a panic . What do we do with the body ? We can relocate everyone comfortably , downstairs , in Economy and still provide you with upper class services and amenities . And as compensation , each passenger will receive two vouchers for upper class round trip travel , anywhere in the world . - What happened ? - I don 't know . The guy just flatlined . Yes , I under ... I understand , um , I 'm afraid there 's no choice . In events like this the pilot in command has ... the legal authority to enforce these decisions . No need to worry , okay ? - Mm-hm . - Get your bag . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . Can I help you ? - Can I help you ? - That 's okay . So let me get this straight . We 're going on our honeymoon and you just gave CPR to a man with blood all over his mouth . He was dying ! Well , whatever he was dying from is now all over your lips . Herpes , party of one , your table 's ready . Hey , Liz . Now , it 's a party for two . Hey , I saw him move , seriously . Down there , check it out . How long before his body starts decomposing ? I have no idea . I can smell him already . We 're trapped with a dead body for the next 6 hours ? Okay . Okay . I 'm sorry about that . Don 't you act like you 're not all freaked out there , creepy scorpion girl ! Death is a part of life . A part of your life , maybe , but not a part of mine . It will be , one day . I knew it . Already cooled ! Back it up a little . Almost there . Good . Uh ... How about right here , guys . Got it ? Yeah . Got it . Thank you . All right . - Thanks , guys . - That 's crazy . We gotta buckle him in . Where is the stupid seat belt ... ! Okay . Let 's go . Let 's get out of here . Hey . You were helping the dead guy , right ? - What happened to him ? - I don 't know . Was it contagious ? It might be . Hey . You know , um , about what you were saying before ? You know , " death is a part of life . " I agree with you . Yeah . Yeah . I mean the guy who died , probably thought he had all the time in the world . He sat on the plane , had no idea it was all going to end today . And maybe he wanted to write a book . Maybe he wanted to have kids . Sorry ... too late . But if you remember that ... one day , you and I , all of us ... we 'll all be dead . You won 't want to waste one second of whatever time we have left . Yeah . I wish I could live like that . Well , why can 't you ? People get all tied up in what they think they should do . When you die , you die . No one 's gonna give you gold stars in heaven for going to business school or marrying a hot wife . How did you know I went to business school ? Didn 't ? Wrong guess . - It 's obvious , isn 't it ? - Yeah . Excuse me ! Hey , hon ' , I was just , uh , showing her our wedding photos and thinkin ' of figuring how we could organize them by doing ... Yeah , forget the photos . Okay . People are going to start dropping in the aisles with blood pouring out their anuses . This is my honeymoon . Hi , can I get you some coffee ? - Coffee ? - Please . Here you go . Please don 't smile . Please don 't smile . Everybody , put your seatbelt on ! Suzy , go ! - Oh , God ! - No ! Oh , no ! Tom , put your mask on ! Tom ! Come on ! Come on , Tom , breathe ! Tom , put it back ! Brad ! It 's not working ! Take mine ! No ! No ! Put it on ! All right . Hang on . Pia . Pia . Pia . Breathe . Breathe . - Aah ! - Breathe ! I 'm removing my mask . - You okay ? - Yeah . This is the Captain speaking . We 've just experienced a cabin de-pressure ... our on board computer indicates ... that a seal was damaged from previous turbulence . We 've isolated the issue and we 're flying at a lower altitude . Cabin pressure has been restored to normal . You may remove your oxygen masks and breathe freely . Any passengers in distress , please notify flight crew . Everyone stay in your seat , with seatbelt fastened . Are you okay ? Is everyone okay ? Oh , my God . Come on . Come on . Here you go . Come on . Just breathe. just breathe . Breathe , please breathe . Come on . Please , breathe . Please ... . That 's it , that 's it . Slow down . Slow down . It 's okay . It 's okay . Okay . You okay ? You 're okay . You 're okay . You 're safe . - How are you doing , you okay ? - Um , yeah . I told you we shouldn 't have come on this trip . I thought we were going down . Yeah . You know , I should have known ... 'cause my fingernails were blue . It 's oxygen deprivation . Can you clean that up ? - Hey , Suzy . We should do a sweep . - Okay . Yes . Any trash ? Thank you . We could have tried , again . I couldn 't , not a third time . What if it happens again ? When I was younger , all I wanted to do was be a mom . I never talked about a job and career . 'Cause you wanted to be happy while your friends think you 're cool and ambitious . But ... in my heart , my real dream , I just wanted a home with you and our children running around . Yeah , so did I. I was just ... helpless , for the first time . Do you want a blanket ? - I 'm just gonna stretch my legs . - Yeah . Honey , look ... What ? You okay ? That dead guy is freaking me out . Gnarly ! Oh , no . All right . Thanks for the watch . So . Here I am ... with my brand new Rolex . Just a little , uh , a little present from my , my new friend ... over here . He 's got some hygeine issues ... and uh ... he , he doesn 't talk very much , either . But , really , I 'm just dying for you to meet him ... So , here ... is ... . Aah ! Tokyo Radio . This is Vista Pacific Flight 7500 Heavy , do you copy ? Tokyo Radio . This is Vista Pacific Flight 7500 Heavy , do you copy ? Death is a part of life . - You okay ? - Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Fine . Ever have anyone die on a flight before ? No , first time . - It 's so sad . - Yeah , it 's crazy . Hey , you know that guy in row 13 , the one that 's always playing video games ? Yeah . 13F . He hasn 't been in his seat in a while . What ? Um ... . - 13F ? - Yeah . Excuse me . Do you know where the passenger who 's sitting there is ? Did he move seats ? Um , yeah . He went upstairs . Upstairs ? Come on . Hello ? Sir , you need to go back to your seat . The body 's gone . We have to go . Remember that trip we took to Cabo ? When we , uh , had a huge fight in the hotel room and didn 't speak for what , four days ? - Mm-hm . - Yeah , I remember . Why are you bringing up the worst time we ever had ? Because I keep thinking about how much time we wasted . The weather was great , the hotel was beautiful . I just ... we were the disaster . Yeah . I don 't want to waste any more time . What do you mean , " the body is gone " ? I think this kid moved it as a prank . Well , we better find it or we 'll all be grounded . Look , it 's gotta be on board . Just do a sweep , row by row . - We 're gonna do a sweep , row by row , okay ? - Okay . - Yeah . - Hey , Pete , um , can I ask you something ? Did you happen to see a ... a jet flying near us ? a , an F-16 ? An F-16 ? No . I 'll investigate and report back . Thank you , Captain . It 'll be fine , gonna be fine ... Please . Please . Please . Thank God . Aah ! Excuse me . I 'm so sorry . Just one second . - Thank you . - Thank you . - Excuse me . - Sure , I uh ... Alright . There you go . Hey , I just overheard the flight attendant ... the dead body , is missing . - What ? - How could it be missing ? I don 't know . A passenger is missing , too . I saw him go upstairs , never came back , and ... Okay , this is going to sound weird , but I saw something on my monitor . - It kinda looked like the dead guy . - Come on ! Holy crap ! I saw him , too . Why wouldn 't you tell me that ? This is not the time for us to work out our communication issue . - There 's a dead body missing , focus ! - Yeah , I know . Hey , guys . We need to find out who the hell this dead guy is . 'Cause whatever 's going on , it 's ' cause of him . Yeah . Hey , check his carry-on . I don 't understand . He 's gone . You know what I always wonder ? What do people think about just before they die ? You know who I 'd be thinking about ? My first boyfriend ... Sean Osborne . He 'd kiss me and , and my knees would literally go weak . I had to ... hold on him , just so I wouldn 't fall . Always hoped ... I 'd find that with Nick ... and I never quite got there . - I 'm sorry . - Yeah ? Yeah . So ... - any luck with the body ? - No . Pete , I know you 're not gonna leave your wife . - What ? - It ... it 's okay , you know . You 've kids together . I wish it was different . It 's all timing . Laptop . An ID . Here we go . Dead guy 's name , Lance Morrell from Corona , California . Is this hair ? Has names on it , Tracy , Anne , Katy . - Oh , my God . They 're his victims . - We don 't know that . This product is known in the State of California to cause cancer . - This is what he 's using to kill them . - With cancer ? Really ? What , like a weapon ? My mom would alway say that my dad gave her cancer . - Laptop 's locked . - Uh ... You try his birthdate . 4 / 15 / 72 . No ? It 's really great stuff . Takes the edge off . I don 't know . You 're stealing that dead guy 's stuff ? Have at it ! Try to keep them together . Works like a purse , you know ? What 's this ? What are you doing ? It 's not what you think . This is , uh , Lance Morrell 's stuff . The passenger who died . You 've no right to be going through someone else 's property . Yeah ? Well , something 's happening on this plane and it all started when he died . Look , we know the body 's missing , and the passenger . - And you saw something , too . - I didn 't see anything . Through the window , I heard you . We need to get into his checked luggage . His checked luggage , in the cargo hold ? Yeah , there might be something in there that will tell us what 's going on . - You can get in there . - Enough ! - Now go back to your seats . - Yes , ma 'am . - Okay . You want me to come with you ? Nope , I want you at the hatch . What is that ? - It says it 's a shinigami . - It 's a death doll . Looks like Lance was delivering it to a client in Tokyo . Cool . In Japanese mythology , shinigami is a death spirit . When you 're ripped from your life too quickly , you have to let go of whatever is holding you here , so you can move on . Once you 've done that , the real shinigami will take your soul ... to the afterlife . Why would someone bring that on a plane ? I don 't know , but I can tell you one thing ... This Lance guy is holding on ... and he 's not letting go . I 'm sorry , Meg . Radio Tokyo . Come in . This is Vista Pacific Flight 7500 Heavy . No ! No ! Did you hear that ? I don 't want that on the plane . How should we do that ? Open up a window ? Hey , you okay ? What the fuck was that ? Alright , alright , stay calm , stay calm . We 're going to be okay . Come with us . Liz ! Death is a part of life . No idea it was all gonna end today . You wouldn 't want to waste one second of whatever time we have left , if you remember ... that one day ... you and I , all of us ... we 'll be dead . Not here ! God ! Oh , God ! I don 't understand . What ? What ? Hey , hey . Come on . Come on . Look at me . Look at me . Look at me . What was back there ? What was back there ? When you 're ripped from your life too quickly ... you have to let go of whatever is keeping you here ... before you can move on . This evening the Pacific Flight 7500 from Los Angeles to Tokyo alerted traffic controllers . They were encountering rougher turbulence than expected , but soon after that , all communication with the plane ceased . We believe the turbulence must have loosened a critical seal ... and that seal gave way , a short time later , creating a rapid decompression event within the plane . At this point in time , we believe the oxygen masks malfunctioned . In a de-pressurized environment , the lack of oxygen would be fatal . Gosh ! Breathe , come on , breathe . All communication attempts from that point on ... have been unsuccessful . Did you happen to see a jet , an F-16 ? F-16s were scrambled to take a closer look at the plane , but ... no signs of life could be seen . Excuse me , excuse me , sir . Is there any chance of survival for those on board ? At this point in time , we believe the chances of survival are slim . Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those on board . The plane 's been flying on autopilot for the last 5 hours . It is expected to run out of fuel and crash into the Pacific . We 'll continue to give information as it is made available to us . Don 't let me go . I won 't .

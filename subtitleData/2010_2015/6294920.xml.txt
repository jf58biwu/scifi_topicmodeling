 That ought to do it . The Atari 2600 was the pioneer in home video game systems . It created a cultural phenomenon , but most importantly , a ripe industry gaining billions of dollars . Atari 's success and brand loyalty was so strong , they were able to produce games as cheaply and quickly as possible . But in 1982 , it would all come to an end . This is when they produced a game based on the highest grossing film of that year , Steven Spielberg 's . Eee Tee . The man chosen to program the game was Howard Scott Warshaw , based off the previous success of . Yars ' Revenge and Raiders of the Lost Ark . Under normal circumstances , programming a game took Warshaw six to seven months . For Eee Tee , he was only given five weeks in order to meet the deadline for the Christmas shopping season . The end result was a strange and incoherent game that alienated devoted gamers . To this day , it 's viewed as the biggest commercial failure in video gaming history . Atari suffered a 536 million dollar loss , not only bankrupting the company , but bringing the entire industry down with it , an event known as the Video Game Crash of 1983 . As a result of overproduction , over two million copies of the game were said to have been buried somewhere in the New Mexico desert . And that is why we at Cockburn Inc . Will be making Eee Tee 2 for today 's most advanced video gaming platforms . But will fans be eager to buy a game based off of such a reputation , even though the new version will be better ? Oh . Well , that 's the beauty , Mr. Cockburn . It won 't be better . We 'll make it even worse . Did you say worse ? Oh , absolutely ! It 's called outside-the-box marketing . This is highly irregular . I know . Research shows gamers these days are playing games they hate . They think bad is the new good . Consequently , we 'll cut our expenses and double our profits . If people hate the games they 're playing , why are they still playing them ? Oh , because of this guy . And for him to endorse it , it 's almost too brilliant . This is the vile crap I had to grow up with as a kid . Gamers today are so lucky . They never have to encounter anything that sinks to this level of filth . Ah , man ! There 's so many projectiles on this screen . It 's impossible to avoid . It 'd be easier to go out in a thunderstorm and try to dodge rain . You touch the floors , you die . You touch the walls , you die . You touch the ceiling , you die . You die , you die , you die , die , die , die , die , die , die ! Ha ha ha ha ha ! So there 's this guy on the Internet called the Angry Video Game Nerd , and he claims that he 's reviewing all these old , shitty video games to give closure on all the ruined childhoods . Like what were they thinking ? I fucking love the Nerd . Your accuracy in this game has to be so precise that hitting your mark is like trying to piss into a shot glass that 's spinning on a record player that 's strapped to a running cheetah 's back while you 're riding on a unicycle blindfolded . Ha ha ha . In other words , it 's pretty hard . Ha ha ha . They just want to cover up the truth with their awesome cover that makes the game look great when really , it just rips kids off their hard-earned allowance money . What you do for all of us is a public servicing . You 're , you 're so much the awesomeness . It 's both a form of kind of retroactive revenge , but it 's also therapeutic . It would be easier to pick fly shit out of pepper while wearing boxing gloves . Crazy dude . He 's freaking crazy ! Oh , man . I remember that game . Awesome ! We are your biggest fans . Drew you this picture . Love the Nerd . I drew a little portrait . I got your custom t-shirt right here . Well , who else can you think of that actually cuddles up with the AVGN plush doll every night ? Got a Angry Video Game Nerd tattoo . I got that immortalized in ink . Who goes around punching snakes and spiders ? I am your biggest fan from Germany . Greetings from Cleveland . Norway . Toronto , Ontario . Mexico City . Dallas , Texas . From Italy . New York . England . Scotland . Sweden . Ukraine . Tennessee . Chile . Brazil . Angry Video Game Nerd episodes helped me to learn English . This game is a blizzard of balls . It 's a catastrophe of ass . The suffering of someone is the pleasure of another . I try to respect the pain that you go through . Could you please review Eee Tee for the Atari 2600 ? I mean it 's the worse game of all time . Heard legends of it that it 's buried in the landfill somewhere . Let 's just keep this one buried . Why is it called Xenophobe , anyway ? Well , apparently it means having a fear of anything foreign . Well , if by foreign it means a drooling , alien creature that 's gonna kill me , you bet your ass I fear it . When in the name of the ass are you going to do the Eee Tee ? You are my last hope . Please do Eee Tee . Where the fuck is Eee Tee ? It sucked balls . Glug , glug , glug . You see , is it really that hard ? Review Eee Tee . Why not Eee Tee ? You drink tea . Review Eee Tee . Are you on the Internet again ? Eee Tee . Eee Tee . The game just goes on and on and on . I don 't think there 's an ending . The only objective I can think of is to rack the score up to 999,999 . But no , it stops at 999,990 . That is nine video game points you will never have . So , when does the game end ? When you shut the fucker off and throw it out your window . Back up , back up . Here 's to Xenophobe , Xeno fucking piece of dog shit ! Oh , cut , cut . Perfect take , Nerd . Nice throw , man . Want another angle ? Cooper , I appreciate the help , but usually I film these videos all by myself . Wanna wide shot ? No . Closeup ? No . An over-the-shoulder ? No ! A behind-the-knee shot ? What ? Hm , alright . That one is gonna be good . Alright . We 're late for work . If you want to be a nerd like me , you got to make some unique sacrifices . No physical fitness , no social popularity , and most important , no girls . Nerds before birds . That 's the way . Holy mother of God ! Do you see that , Nerd ? They 're making Eee Tee 2 . That means you 're finally gonna review the original Atari Eee Tee , right ? Cooper , this is too much to comprehend . And no , I 'm never reviewing Eee Tee . But , but the timing is perfect , man . You have to do it now . I 'd rather suck the dry shit out of a dog 's ass fur . You know it 's your most requested game . You get emails about it all the time . You 're still checking my emails ? I got to ! 'Kay , let 's go to work . You know it 's considered the worse game of all time , right ? Oh , trust me ; I know . That illogical gameplay . We don 't know what to do . Falling in the pits over and over again . It brings my piss to a boil . Well , then why not do it , man ? It 'd be perfect . I 'll help if you want . Have you watched my videos yet ? No , what is it , Super Video Dude ? No , man . It 's Super Rad Video . Game Dude . Ah , rad . Hey , Angry Video Game Nerd ! Hey , how you doing ? Hey , I saw your last review and I was laughing my ass off . I just had to go buy the game on eBay and see how bad it was and man , you were right . Whoa , whoa . No , no . Yeah . Herb , can I see you in here for a moment ? Hello . No , you listen to me , you sick fuck ! No , yours is sick fuck . You 're sicker than fucking sick . Yeah , and I have the DNA to prove it ! Alright , I 'll see you at 8 . What do you want ? You called me here . Oh , right , Herb . I 'm sorry about that . Look , Herb , I , I just wanted to tell you there 's gonna be a couple of changes . But my name is Nerd , Mr. Swann . My fucking father 's name was Mr. Swann . Please call me John . Now one of the things we 're gonna change is that you 're gonna start wearing these . Yeah , let 's see . Oh , that looks great . But more importantly , a shipment of War Duty 3000 came in today . And because you 're the fucking expert , I was fucking wondering just off the top of my head , do you think we should put it in the front display ? I don 't think that 's a good idea . Bullshit ! That 's going in the front display , and it 's your job to sell it . But I can 't sell people games that look this unbelievably bad . I don 't even play most of these newer games . Go for the gun ! I 'd rather not . Go for the gun ! Take it out of my hand ! You 're gonna sell it . I don 't give a shit about your happy horseshit . Sega games or the Gamekid or all that shit . What 's ever on that shelf , you get it sold ! Hello . What ? It 's a boy ? Aw . No , I knew my semen was good . Hey ! Angry Video Game Nerd . Hey . Hey , what 's you holding there ? War Duty 3000 . Oh , did you play it ? What , are you kidding me ? Just looking at it makes me feel like having an anal evacuation . I 'd rather have a dick right on my forehead so every day is a struggle not to shoot piss into my own mouth until I eventually drown only to get reincarnated as another dick on my now lifeless body . Ha ha ha . Well , now I got to buy it . I can 't wait to tell everybody that the Angry Video Game Nerd yelled and spat on this game . Oh , and what do you think of that ? They 're putting out Eee Tee 2 . It can 't be as bad as the original , though , right ? You know what ? I heard that Atari recalled all of the cartridges and buried them somewhere in the middle of the desert because the game was so bad . Worst video game of all time . Ha ha ha ha . Oh , you should review Eee Tee ! No . Can you review Eee Tee ? I think you should review Eee Tee . Yeah , come on , Nerd . Review Eee Tee for all the fans . No . When the new Spider-Man movie came out , what game did you review ? Spider-Man . And when the new Transformers movie was released , what game did you review ? Transformers . So , the new Eee Tee is here . The time is right . Do Eee Tee . Eee Tee ! No ! Nerd ! Wait , wait . I 'm sorry . It 's just that we really want to know what you think of that game . Can you at least tell me ? Off the record . Alright , it sucks ass through a straw . That game is proof that we failed as a human race . It 's a horrible abomination that fucks you harder than life itself , and I wish I could send every single cartridge off the face of this earth ! See ? That 's exactly what you say in the video . I can 't even be pissed off and have it mean anything anymore . It 's better to get pissed off than to get pissed on . There 's one thing that I could never get to the bottom of . Hm . Why is that Eee Tee game so infamously popular ? Well , it 's the worse game , but it 's the greatest game story ever told . I mean when gamers found out Eee Tee was buried in that landfill , it became forever buried in our conscious minds . You really believe they buried two million cartridges in the fucking desert ? Yeah ! Well , how can you dispute the dozens of eyewitness accounts , hundreds of online articles , testimonies from . New Mexico high schoolers , reporters ? Even the mayor of Alamogordo for Pete 's sake . Here , take the wheel . Whoa , whoa , whoa . I mean it doesn 't make any sense . So , they give the game to one person to design in five weeks , and perpetually make bad games over and over again with the mentality that people would just buy them . And now you 're saying they buried all the cartridges ? That 's bullshit . They would have recycled all those cartridges . They were so stingy , they would have reused every piece of plastic and saved every last cent . Here 's a photo of the actual game carts Whoa . Laying at the bottom of the landfill . You got to be kidding me . This is the shittiest photo I 've ever seen . Looks like it 's been put through a copy machine 100 times . I don 't see any games in there ! It 's no better than a picture of the Loch Ness Monster showing the loch with nothing in it or a picture of Bigfoot shown in the woods with nothing in it or a picture of a UFO showing the sky with nothing in it . This is a picture of a landfill with nothing fucking in it ! Hey , I happen to have seen Bigfoot twice ; Two of them . Oh , you saw two Bigfoots ? Mm-hm . Would they be Bigfeet ? They had big feet . Mandi ! Oh , we 're just pulling up . We 'll be there in a sec . Who 's that ? Where are we going ? Just trust me . Give me a Rock . Rolling . Are you the Nerd ? Um , uh , yeah . Oh , my god ! This is so cool . Would you sign my breasts ? I 'm his manager . I handle all the important documents . Really ? Oh , okay . There you go . Bye . Holy shitskies , man . I 'm never taking a shower again . She got them big-ass titties . I 'd like to bang that booty like ah , uh . Hey , stop that . Stop ! Always remember the golden rule . Nerds before birds , right ? Hi , Cooper . Hey , Nerd , my man . Hey . What 's up ? Alright , give me just a minute and I 'll come over to that table . Wait , what the hell is this ? This is a tremendous career move . Just hear her out . Mr. Nerd , I 'm Mandi with Cockburn Inc . I 've been talking with Cooper on email for so long . It 's great to finally meet the Nerd himself . I know how extremely busy you both are , so I 'm not gonna rattle on and on . Thanks . I would like to present you with an exciting opportunity to review our newest game . Obviously we at Cockburn Inc . Have seen all of your videos . They 're brilliant . So , we knew that this game would be right up your alley . But talk is cheap , right , boys ? So I 'll let this demo walk the walk , so to speak . Ooh , ooh . So what do you think about that , Nerd ? So that 's a yes ? And then you just automatically assumed I 'd be cool with this ? Well , you never said anything about not reviewing the new Eee Tee game . Oh , but don 't you understand ? If I review the new one , I 'm only gonna end up having to do the old one too . Then why not do both ? I can 't . I physically can 't play that game . It caused me so much torment as a child , I 'd rather quit reviewing games permanently . You know what ? You 're right . You should find something else . I can see you doing a lot of things . Shrimp boat captain , iron working , nuclear decontamination tech , roofing , reviewing the new Eee Tee game . No ! Come on . Just think it over . Anyway , I better get inside . Mom 's gonna kill me if I 'm not inside before the streetlights come on . Cooper ? Get your ass in here ! Didn 't I tell you to get in before the streetlights come on ? Gotta go . Bye . Where have you been ? See , uh-huh . You was at that young girl titty bar . Didn 't I tell you to stay away from the titties ? No ! Whoa ! Oh , oh . Ah ! Oh no . Not again ! Whoa ! Oh , couldn 't I just wake up after the first fall ? Ah ! You motherfucker . Ah ! You fucking piece of shit ! Ah ! Even my dreams are low-budget . Oh , my god . They found it . I don 't know how , but they found it . No ! No ! No ! Whoa ! Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! Whoa ! Ah ! I have to save the fans . Noob . Come on , they nerfed PvP . And you still using those items . That 's level 15 , level 26 already . Nerd ! What 's up , man ? Cooper , is this thing working , can you hear me ? Yeah , dude , you 're moving so slow , man . Here , take this item . What ? Equip it . Equip it ? Okay . No , the other hand . Cooper , we need to do something about this Eee Tee game . We need to bury it in the past where it belongs and prevent future generations from being emotionally scarred . Dude , you can 't do that . That 's the most popular bad game of all time . I know . It 's all because of that stupid landfill story . Hm . Yeah . Cooper , meet me outside right now . Alright , just let me finish this level . Now ! Oh , man . My mom is gonna kill me . Psst . Cooper ! Shh . Whoa ! Alright , hurry up and tell me about this crazy plan of yours . We 're gonna find that landfill and prove that there 's nothing under there . Maybe then everybody can forget about this game . My mom doesn 't let me wipe my own ass , let alone go to Alamogordo , New Mexico . Then fine , stay home and be a mama 's boy , but there 's no chance you 'll ever see me review that game . But if we find any games under that sand , I 'll review it . In fact , I 'll play every single one of them . Oh , okay . It 's a deal . But the only way to properly search that landfill would be with ground-penetrating radar and a whole excavation team . Heh , well , then let 's do it ! We can 't afford that . Hm , you want to play manager ? Well , then you manage that . Play ? Yeah ! How do you like your new Nerdmobile , boys ? Ah , it 's great ! Yeah ? You love it ? And like I said , everything is fully paid for and endorsed by Cockburn , Inc . We 're going to video document the trip . It will be great content to lead up to your big game review . Oh , and Nerd , there 's going to be a whole excavation team waiting there with ground-penetrating radar just like you asked . Let me help you with that . New game review ? I didn 't agree to this . You 're gonna have to review this new game if you want to debunk the old one . It 's a fair trade . Well , ah , I wasn 't . Really don 't like the idea of bringing this girl with us . Relax , Nerd . She 's our producer . And she 's not a girl , she 's a gamer . Hi guys . Everything alright over there ? Good . At a time like this , the fans need you more than ever , Nerd . You know what ? I don 't think this van has a radio . And I brought a lot of things to install in our van : GPS , mobile internet access , roof camera . But I forgot to think about music . Don 't worry , I got the music covered . Nice , you got an MP3 player ? No . CD player ? No . Cassette ? 8 Track ? No . Th , then what do you got ? Is this a joke ? Nerd , Eee Tee ? You should kill that guy . You see that guy right there ? That 's me . There , I just posted an announcement that you 're doing the Eee Tee 2 review . Um . No . I don 't know Mandi , this excavation project is costly . What does it have to do with the Nerd 's Eee Tee 2 review ? Just trust me , Mr. Cockburn . With the Nerd behind this , plus the video documenting the trip , we 'll make a million times the cost . Well , we like how you think outside the box , but since this is your first big project , let me give you a little advice . Don 't get too close to these nerds . They are the product . Eh , you can 't sell something if it becomes too precious to part with . Don 't worry , Mr. Cockburn . They 're just a couple of dorks . I 'll get you some video ASAP . Over and out . Hey , we 're almost there , Nerd . Is that our whole excavation team ? Yeah . Well , there 's been some budget cuts . Alright , whatever . Let 's film this . I 'm so excited ! My first Nerd video . Alright . Rolling . Out here in the New Mexico desert , something allegedly happened many years ago . Yeah , we 're talking Eee Tee , extraterrestrial and we 're gonna get to the bottom of it . General Dark Onward , sir . I think we may have something a little disconcerting here . Sounds like they 're looking for extraterrestrials . What ? Yes , sir . I fear espionage . Maybe they 're just tourists . Maybe again , maybe they 're terrorists . Tourists , terrorists , what 's the difference ? Scan their vehicle . They say Eee Tee is buried under the sand , somewhere not too far from where we are now . And we 're gonna solve the whole case . I 'll take care of this . And present all the facts and prove what is there . So stand by , from the Nerd . General ! If you don 't mind me saying , sir , that 's a little excessive , sir . Well , maybe you 're right . Send an MP unit to search their vehicle . Make sure they don 't have anything that will threaten homeland security . Yes , sir . On second thought . Sir . I think I should supervise this mission personally . I don 't think that will be necessary , General . You 're needed for more vital things , sir . Well , I insist . If something important 's about to blow up , I want to be there . Yes , sir . Goddamn terrorist alien hunters . I 'll blow their nuking asses out that ship and back again . Hey guys , you find anything ? Nope , not yet . Come on , patience , Nerd . It 's gonna take a while to analyze the data . Well , I hate to be the one to debunk the myth , but it 's got to be done . You know , one day you find out there 's no Santa Claus . Any other line of thinking only leads to disappointment . Wait , that 's not true . Santa Claus is real . Yeah ? Well , you probably believe the world is flat . The world is flat . So , how come nobody 's ever fallen off ? Gravity ? Oh , okay . Well uh , hasn 't the world been photographed from space ? Have you ever examined a photograph of the world from space ? I mean , you can only see one side at a time . See , the earth is flat , like a coin . And the water and land roll over it like a conveyor belt . That 's why we have day and night . Well , what about heaven and hell ? Do you believe in that ? Yeah , that all comes down to Death Mwauthzyx and that 's a known fact of nature . Death Mwa , what ? Death Mwauthzyx . You don 't know about that ? No . Please educate me . Death Mwauthzyx is a cyber mutant death god living under Mount Fuji . He created both God and Satan . Yeah , sure . No , I swear . This is all true . And this thing has the power to end all life as we know it . With a single turn of the satellite dish on top of his head , every universe and the Multiverse will disappear . The Ultraverse and the Megaverse will collapse . The six dimensions will flatten into one and all existence will be obliterated . Oh , wow . So , everything you believe exists will no longer exist ? No , it 'll be as if it never existed at all . So , non-existence , no space , nothing ? Nope . Well , one thing will remain , bologna sandwich . So , like , a giant bologna sandwich , or just like a regular ? No size . I mean , since nothing else exists in existence to compare it to , this thing would be scaleless . Wow . Scaleless . That 's the stupidest thing I 've ever heard . It 's the fuzz ! We don 't have a permit . I 'm gonna make a run for it . Cooper ! Get in the truck . Come on , stop ! Don 't be so suspicious . Yeah , man . Just play it cool . It 's fine . Put your hands on the vehicle . What have you guys got in the back of that big van , huh ? You got some migrant workers ? You got some sex traffic ? You got some drug mules ? You guys got some cocaA-na shoved up your butts ? No ma 'am , just video games . Get me the fuck out of here ! Just let me handle this , okay ? I 'm sorry , ma 'am . We didn 't know that we were doing anything wrong . Put your hands on the vehicle . Alright , alright honey . Don 't get your panties in a wad . I 'm not wearing any panties . Hot . Get me into that . What the hell ? Oh , goddamn it , men . You had two days . You could have had a ramp installed . Sorry sir , it 's hard to keep track of your accidents . Check out that van . Well , what you got back there ? It 's just video games . Just video games ? Look at me , son . You trying to steal American government secrets ? No , sir . We 're just trying to do a game review . See ? Gun ! Ooh , you listen to me , numb-nuts . You see this ? Please , god , no . This will put a second anus where your head used to be , goddammit . You fuck with the USA , you fuck with Dark Onward . You want this ? No ! Oh , my god ! Where the hell are you all going ? Help me ! Oh , my god . Where 's my fucking arm ? Get in ! Come on , in the van . I have to give it a proper burial . Come on , in the van . That 's gonna leave a mark , oh . Ah , hang on , they 're not after us anymore . Yeah , they are . Oh , sh . That 's alright , hang on . After them , McButter . Get going ! Brilliant idea , sir . Don 't we have any weapons aboard this vehicle ? No , sir . We took them out so we could fit your chair , sir . Okay , hang on . Oh , shit . The hell 's the matter with this damn thing ? You 're in it , sir ? Hang on , bitches . I got this . Really ? Whoa . What the hell are all these fucking boxes doing here ? Oh , god . Wait , wait . What the hell is that ? Fruit , sir . My god , did you see the size of those melons ? Take a note , McButter . Ha ha ha . Watch out for the people . Straight through . Straight through . I didn 't sign up for this . Oh , just chill out . Make this thing go faster . Get the thing going . It helps if you shake me , sir . Really ? No . Ah ! Whoa ! Oh , my god . Glass , a sheet of glass . It 's alright . Shit soup . Thank you . Just keep going . Would you like a steering wheel in the back , sir ? Yes , I would . Look out ! No , no . No ! What ? Explanation McButter ? Glass , sir . Double pane , sir . Good driving . Thanks . Looks like doing an Eee Tee review will be tough now . Darn , just when I was finally warming up to the idea . Really ? No . Aw . What was that madman shouting about ? We did nothing wrong . Something about government secrets . You know , we 're only a couple of hours away from Roswell , so . Oh , yeah . Isn 't that where the UFO crashed ? Yes , in 1947 . Oh , for the love of Pong . One hoax at a time . There 's probably a perfectly logical reason why those fuck nuts didn 't want us near that landfill . Whoa , did , did you see that ? I guess they didn 't destroy it totally . No , no , it just came back together . No , that didn 't happen . We 're dehydrated and hallucinating . I don 't know why , but I 'm sure there 's more to this game than we realize . We should go to the source , Howard Scott Warshaw . The guy who made the game , seriously ? Yeah , why not ? I 'll just pull up his location . Okay . Fine , he 'll agree that there are no games under that landfill . Even better , we 'll get him saying it on video . He made Yars ' Revenge , but he also made Eee Tee I mean it 's like , somebody gave you a present , but then took a shit on your doorstep at the same time . It 's like Santa with diarrhea . So uh , this is Warshaw 's house ? Jeez . Yeah , I 'm pretty sure . Hm . Eh , at least he 's hospitable . It smells . Read the sign ! Whoa ! You 're never gonna take me alive , you no-good , goddamn gumshoe son of a bitch . Whoa . Wait , wait , wait . We , we just want to ask you some questions about Eee Tee . Eee Tee ? Eat lead , you FBI scum ! Whoa ! Wait . Um , wait . We 're not FBI . We 're just gamers . We want an interview . Gamers ? Why didn 't you say so ? Come in . Should I get the camera for the video ? Not yet . I have a funny feeling about this . Oh iii . Nerd , let 's just go home , man . No , no wait . He 's just testing us . You can do it , Nerd . It 's just , it 's a game . Yeah , an impossible one that relies on the gamer to take a shitty guess . Like , maybe there 's an invisible block . Well , kick it . Yeah . Wow . Okay . Nice . Whoa . Can 't say I didn 't expect that . Okay . Okay . I 'm coming . Oh . Watch out ! Oh , shit . Okay , now ? Come on , yeah . You can make it . Ha ha ha ha . Care for some lemonade ? Are you Howard Scott , what ? My name is Doctor Louis Zandor . Won 't you join me ? What the hell was all that back there ? I had to make sure you were just gamers . Only a gamer would know to jump at nothing to find a hidden block . And something tells me you 're not just some gamer , but THE gamer . Did you know the Atari logo was based off Mount Fuji ? I always find that odd . Well , how may I help you ? Well , obviously we came to the wrong place . We were looking for Howard Scott Warshaw . Why do you seek Warshaw ? Well , we wanted to ask him about the Eee Tee Atari game , specifically the legend of the landfill . Ha ha ha ha , . Not true , not true . Quickly , everyone ! Into the kitchen . Come ! Everybody into the fridge , now . Wait , wait , what are we doing in here ? They might be listening to us . You understand , they can 't hear us in the fridge . Who can 't hear us ? Who do you think ? Many years ago , I was a scientist in a nonexistent place called Dreamland or Area 51 as the civilians came to know it . It was the height of the Cold War and Americans were as paranoid as potheads at a policeman 's ball . So , you 're an ex Area 51 employee . Huh , jeez . Don 't people ever get bored of all this Area 51 nonsense ? Yes , it 's true . Now , listen . Chocolate pudding ? No , I 'm alright . A beer ? Yeah . Ah , there you go . Anyway , I was a rising star in their aerodynamics program , so they put me onto the ongoing top-secret Roswell project as their head reverse engineer . Roswell , there it is again . The UFO crashed there in 1947 , right ? Precisely . When that sucker crashed in the desert , it broke up like one of those clay pigeons in Duck Hunt . There was metallic debris all over the desert . Or debriss . No , it 's debris . Well , there 's an s . Why isn 't it pronounced debriss ? A greater mystery than this . Anyway , the metal was like nothing on Earth . It was thin , almost identical to tinfoil , except that it reacted strangely when you played around with it , displaying strange magnetic properties . I was one of few who figured out how to harness the powers of this metal . The government wanted me to rebuild the Roswell spaceship , but I realized that any nation with a spacecraft like that would have unstoppable power . Our civilization wasn 't ready for that , so I refused to continue on the project . Needless to say , I was forced into resignation . After that , my life quickly went into a tailspin . I couldn 't find work as a custodial engineer let alone a reverse engineer . What does this have to do with anything ? Well , my resentment towards those Area 51 pricks got the best of me and I found the instrument of my retribution , video games . I took notice of a young pioneering game designer , Howard Scott Warshaw , whose games were revolutionary in their day . Not only were they met with great success , but he also came up with inventive ways of hiding little secrets within the games , such as his own initials or hidden characters . This gave me the inspiration I needed . I began developing a program which emulates the Area 51 floor plan , a perfect blueprint of their precious secret base . Meanwhile , Warshaw was asked to begin the now infamous Eee Tee game . Atari gave him only five weeks to complete the whole project . Yes , the game was finished , but no one can single-handedly design a game in five weeks . Unbeknownst to everyone , that final night before the Christmas deadline , I offered him my Area 51 code , and he accepted . So , you 're saying the Eee Tee game sucks ass because it 's not really meant to be a game ? It 's a floor plan to Area 51 ? What can I say ? Subversiveness has always been my downfall . Naturally , I was on a watch list and they found out or whatever , and the next thing I know , the government , not Atari , orders a recall on all the games and dumps them into the Alamogordo desert . Holy shit ! Meanwhile , I was given hard time to serve . You don 't say ? But I escaped . And I 've been on the run ever since . My only satisfaction is the fact that before I quit Area 51 , I stole the dreamland material to prevent them from ever reassembling the spaceship . You stole the pieces of the UFO ? I had to . I replaced it with ordinary tinfoil . And I 've kept it safely hidden to this very day . Okay , so I think I 've got most of that . Basically , you put a map of the most top secret place in the world inside a video game all out of revenge ? Not quite . I did it to save my friend so that I could one day return to rescue the alien . Oh , we have an alien now too , huh ? What , what 's wrong with you , Nerd ? That 's the real deal , man . Yes . Not being able to save him was one of my greatest regrets . Anyway , I 'm too old now for rescue missions . Louis ? Yes , dear ? I 'm cold . Right . Sorry , general . I wasn 't able to hear much when they were huddled in the fridge . I 'll keep an ear on them . Whatever . I just can 't believe that we 've finally found Doctor Louis Zandor , and these idiots let us straight to his doorstep . McButter ? Yes , sir ! I want Zandor apprehended and groveling at my treads tonight . Yeah . Ha ha ha . How 's that fence coming ? Oh , it 's good , sir . Um , we should have the whole landfill closed out by tonight . No one will ever be getting here anymore . About time . I 've been asking for that goddamned fence since 1983 . He 's been asking since 1983 ! Will you hurry up ? Mm-hm . What the fuck 's going on here ? Get back to work . Just spread your feet out a little bit more . But I don 't even want to learn how to surf . Alright , men . You too , young lady . The time for the spacecraft 's maiden voyage draws near . With the help of this extraterrestrial technology , I look forward to the day when we could incinerate anyone who doesn 't eat , breathe , or crap American ! Now let 's have a look at your progress . Yes , sir . Move ! Backing up ! Backing it up . Ah , looks great ! And have you mastered the metal 's mysterious melding power yet ? Absolutely . The metal , please . I see . Fantastic . Alright then . Proceed with your work . Oh . What ? You will all be safe here from the Men in Black now that my stealth cloaking system is activated . So how does it all work ? Well , I first employed this technology in the Eee Tee game . You know how when you play the game , the three phone pieces and the call zones are always hidden someplace different ? Oh , I know . That annoying shit where it sends the gamer on a big , wild goose chase ? Precisely . It will reorient the position of the Men in Black 's radar detection system so it appears the house is randomly appearing across their grid . It 's ingenious . Right . The only side effect is the TV and phone reception gets a little choppy here , but I 'm working on the bugs . For now , make yourselves at home . There are video games upstairs . Just make sure you never step outside . Okay . Thanks , Zandor . Hey , Nerd . Hey . What 's the matter , Nerd ? Um , this whole story about the landfill . Zandor says it 's true and more . Whether he 's crazy or not , all these stories about Area 51 are only gonna generate more interest in the game , and innocent gamers will suffer because of it . Hm . Well , I can think of something we can do that might lift your spirits . Oh , oh , shit . Oh , my god . Oh , my god . It 's so hard ! Yeah , it is . Yeah . Yeah , it feels good . Oh , shit . Faster ! Come on , faster ! Faster ! Yeah , faster ! You got to take it easy on me , okay ? Oh , shit . I don 't normally do it on the pad . Oh , oh , okay , okay . Oh , yeah . I 'm almost there . Yes , yes ! No ! Yes , yes ! Oh , come on . Don 't use your hands . Oh , yes . Oh , look at that . Yeah , it feels good . You cheated . No , I didn 't cheat . I won . That 's what that looks like . You 're a cheater . I won . You did . Cheater , shut up . Uh . Nuh . Uh . Uh . Uh . Uh . Cockburn , it 's 3 a.m. Hello ? Are , are you there ? Hey , listen . Listen , Mandi . You , you 've got to meet iii morning at the Atari landfill . Wait . Cockburn , you 're , say that again . You 're , you 're breaking up . I , I got the most incredible idea you ever heard . We are gonna do a game convention advertising . Eee Tee 2 at the Atari landfill . No , no . Cockburn , listen to me carefully . Do iii go to the landfill . What ? Go to the landfill ? Okay . No . No , do not go to the landfill . Yeah , meet me there in the morning . It 's gonna be amazing . There 's gonna be like tents and there 's gonna be snacks and there 's gonna be , jeez , you know , gamers gaming with each other and everything . Alright , I 'll see you in the morning . Oh , shit . General , we 're closing in on Zandor 's house as we speak . You never cease to please me , McButter . Wait a minute . Every time the radar swipes over Zandor 's house , it 's at a different coordinate . General , scratch that . We don 't seem to have the right location . The radar 's jumping all over the place . You never cease to disappoint me , McButter . Yes , sir . Hello ? Cockburn ? Shit . Wait a minute . Freeze ! Put your hands up . Oh . Okay . Oh , shit ! Take me to Doctor Louis Zandor . Never . Get in the Jeep . You 're gonna take me to Zandor 's house now ! Fine , bitch ! Ugh . Damn , so violent . Nerd . Nerd . Nerd ! Oh ! Wake up ! Ah , what ? The girl , man . We have to ditch her . Mandi , our producer ? I thought she was a gamer , not a girl . She 's not a gamer . From what Zandor said , I think she 's a secret agent . A secret agent ? No way . Come on , we 're being chased by military police . The girl knows too much . She 's working for them . Cooper , there 's no reason for acting this way . Acting this way ? You 're the one who 's acting all weird and you got a little girlfriend all of a sudden . Oh , fuck off . Don 't break the code . Nerds before birds . Alright , come with me , Cooper . We 're gonna settle this like adults . Mandi ? Mandi ? What 's wrong ? Where 's Mandi ? This happens in every movie . Oh , what ? Like they kidnapped her or something ? More like she kidnapped herself . That 's nonsense . She 's probably just out getting some air . No , she 's nowhere on the property . Well , she 's probably in the shower . No , she 's not in there either . Look what I found on the nightstand . These are phony prescription glasses with fake plastic lenses . Bullshit . Okay , so why would she do this ? To appear more nerdy . It was all an act . Don 't you understand ? She 's bait . I mean we 'll all foolishly try to rescue her and get caught right in the trap . Oh , I feel like such a fool . The moment you share your joystick with a girl , they break it . You 've been taking us around in circles all night , kid . And I am telling you , if you I swear . This is Zandor 's house this time . Ah , what the fuck ! Ahem , sergeant , since we 're here and all , do you think Fred and I could get some ice cream ? Don 't even think about it . The landfill excavation team emailed me the results . Mm-hm . Sorry , Nerd . I 'm here in Alamogordo , New Mexico at the Atari landfill . Here , hundreds of video game enthusiasts have made a mysterious pilgrimage to the resting place of the classic Atari game , Eee Tee , where an unlikely convention has sprung up in the middle of nowhere . I 'm here with Stacie , one of the gaming pilgrims . Stacie , what brought you out here ? It 's all to honor the Angry Video Game Nerd . You know , I saw that it was on Cockburn and then it said he was gonna be reviewing Eee Tee 2 , so then I added it up . You know what I 'm saying ? I mean he 's probably gonna be reviewing the original Eee Tee game and I 'm gonna be here when it all goes down , you know ? So , you know , you can bet he 's gonna show up and I 'll be here ready for it , you know what I 'm saying ? I found this bone in the woods , but it turned out to be wood . So , you know , you never know what 's going to happen , you know what I 'm saying ? Fuck me . I should have never gotten involved with this . And here we are with Bernie Cockburn , the chairman of Cockburn Inc . , the creators of the new Eee Tee 2 . Hello , gamers ! Hey ! You , too , can get your copy of the game right here , right now . For the first 100 gamers to get their new copy of Eee Tee 2 , you 're gonna get a free shovel and the chance to climb over this fence behind me and dig yourself up one of the originals . Ha ha , come on . Be a part of Cockburn 's stock . Be a part of gaming history ! The prophesy is almost fulfilled . I 've got to put an end to all this . I 'm telling you , Mandi , you 've been running me ragged all day long . No , really , sergeant . I know I 've retraced my steps right this time . Howdy . Mind grabbing a family photo ? No . Sure ! No . Come on , right here . No , no , no , no , no . Oh , that 's good . Everybody get in the picture . It 's gonna be cute . You know , a baby . General , our captive is grinding down on my patience . Permission to shoot . Negative , McButter . She 's the only one who knows where Zandor is . Say cheese ! This is amazing ! This is horrible ! I 've got to put an end to this . Step right up , friends , step right up ! I hold before you the new game for the new generation , Eee Tee 2 ! Yeah , ha ha ! There you go , young man . $ 49.95 . Good . Hey , listen . And if you 're fast , you can take that shovel , go dig yourself up one of the originals . Ha ha ha . Go get it . Who 's next ? Who 's next ? Eee Tee 2 . Come on . Ha ha ha . Oh , my god . Eee Tee . Eee Tee . I can 't believe all these geeks found the landfill . General . What is it , McButter ? You 'll never believe where Las Vegas . Please tell me I can shoot her now . I 've had enough of this . Negative , McButter . Yeah , woo ! Woo woo ! No ! No , no , no . No ! Is that , is that , is that the Nerd ? Fellow gamers , may I have your attention ? May I have your attention ? This game is bullshit and the legend behind it is a total lie . There 's no games buried under that landfill . I wish you all would just forget about it . It 's all a myth . You can all go home now . Oh , man . The Nerd just said this is bullshit . Dude , when the Nerd says something is bullshit , it 's bullshit . Well , great . What are we gonna do now ? I guess we just go home . It 's working . It 's working ! Yes ! Come on , Nerd . Let 's just go home , man . I don 't like what this game review is turning you into . It doesn 't matter if you believe in the landfill or not . Oh , my god . Whoa . Holy shit . That 's the guy who made the game . Gamers , here we have Howard Scott Warshaw , a game designer way ahead of his time . He 's responsible for Atari classics such as . Yars ' Revenge , Raiders of the Lost Ark , and Eee Tee . The worst game of all time . How may I be of service , Nerd ? The whole story about the landfill . Tell them it 's not true . Alright , fellow gamers , the legend of the landfill is true . I 've held my silence long enough . It is time for the truth to be told . The government buried these games here a long time ago because those games contain a map , a map to Area 51 , a map designed by Doctor Louis Zandor . And there he is . Join him in digging up these games , every last one . They contain a map that will lead you to a treasure , and that treasure is nothing less than Zandor 's captive friend , the extraterrestrial . Wow . Zandor ! Nerd , I 've seen your videos . I know you are a frank and honest man . People like us , we don 't cover things up . Wouldn 't this be a better world if people told the truth ? The truth , Nerd , that is what you must find . I can 't let this happen . This whole legend has to stop . The game 's not a map to Area 51 . There 's no alien . There 's nothing mystical about that game . Whether there is or isn 't , what does it matter , man ? There 's nothing you can do to disprove it anyway . Like hell there isn 't . What are you gonna do ? I 'm gonna break into Area 51 . What ? If Doctor Zandor isn 't at the top of these steps , you 're gonna be dead . Have faith , butter face . I will kill you , fat butt . Oh . Are you crazy ? Do you have any clue where Area 51 even is ? Between Area 50 and 52 . Come on , man . Haven 't you had enough ? A nerd 's work is never done . Now that , that 's just a stupid line . I only said it for the trailer . Wait . You may need this . McButter ! Yes , sir ? The Nerd and his little friend are coming for us . Use the girl as a diversion . Great idea . I 'll get that . Nerd . You again ? Listen , I have nothing against you Area 51 people . This is all about a video game . Oh . Well , I have a game for you . It 's called come rescue your little girlfriend . Nerd , help me ! She 's not my girlfriend . But you like her , don 't you ? Um , no . What ? Anyway , if you want to find her , she 's on top of the Eiffel Tower . The what ? The mock Eiffel Tower in Las Vegas . Tower in Las Vegas . Oh . It 's a trap , Nerd . Like I said , don 't go . Uh , I 'm not coming . What ? Nerd ? Come up here and rescue me right now . Eff you , you FBI bitch . Yeah , that 'll show her , Nerd . Diversion didn 't work , sir . You should have put her into something more provocative . How the hell can you use her as bait when she 's dressed in causal attire ? General , sir . What is it ? There is something you should see . What do we have here ? This is the guy that 's been causing you all the trouble , sir . He 's an Internet superstar . They call him the Angry Video Game Nerd . Well , let it roll . I 'm finally gonna do it . I 'm gonna land the plane . Up , up , down , down , speed up , speed down . Ah ! Ha ha . Ha ha ha ha . Ha ha , he 's funny . I like him . Ha ha ha . Sir , then there 's his friend . They call him the Super Rad Video Game Dude . Hm . Have you ever taken a really long dump and then you sit on the toilet going , god dang , what did I eat ? That 's the feeling that you get after playing this game . This is Super . Rad Video Game Dude . Oh , not so much . He sucks . Let me learn more about this Angry Video Game Nerd person . Don 't worry , son . It 's just a flesh wound . Look , Nerd . I don 't even care about this game review anymore . I just have a really , really bad feeling about this . Cooper , you don 't want to heroically rescue the girl , you don 't want to run headlong into Area 51 , and now you don 't even want to do a game review ? Uh-uh . What do you want to do ? I 'd like to stay alive . Look , Nerd . You 're living in a fool 's paradise , man . I mean , let me show you all the ways in which we would die . Come with me . For starters , the base is situated in the middle of the desert , hidden by mountains in an area where Mother Nature is at its most treacherous and unforgiving . The base is surveyed by online directional radar and military jeeps . If you pass the signs , deadly force is authorized . Even a bird flying through its airspace would get shot down by ballistic missiles . Burrowing prairie dogs would get smoked out by nerve gas . What ? Oh , shit ! Nerd , how do you expect to get in ? There it is , Cooper . Dreamland . Here 's a walkie-talkie so we can secretly communicate when I make it inside . Secretly ? Nerd , I 'm sure they 're already monitoring us . Don 't be paranoid . How do I look ? Let 's just get this over with . Alright , now , now hold , hold it . Don 't , don 't let it go down yet . Just don 't rock it too much . I can 't hold you . You got to hold still . You want me to die or something ? Be careful . Alright . Now listen , at the count of three , you 're gonna drop me . Alright ? Alright . Now wait for me to get in first . Alright ? One . Whoa ! Shit ! Oh ! Holy hell . Security desk three to unit commander . We 've got a live one . Um , take me to your leader . Oh ! Scalpel . Scalpel . Ah . Intruder ! Ah . Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! What ? Retinal scanner . Rectal scanner . Whatever . Cooper ! I 'm looking at the Eee Tee game . Yeah ? So am I. I mean for real ! Area 51 is literally the game . Of course . How similar ? Well , let me put it this way . Zandor wasn 't too subtle about it . Alright , Nerd , you completed your lunatic mission . Get the hell out of there . Nerd , listen . You 've got company . Don 't ask how I know , just move . Nerd ? Nerd ? Ah ! Wouldn 't this be a better world if people told the truth ? Well , Nerd , ha ha ha ha ha . We meet again . From now on , there 'll be no more fighting between us . I 've been watching some of your videos . We appreciate your work . You might even say we 're big fans of yours here at Area 51 . Here , let me show you something . I need your expertise . No . Won 't you play this game for me ? Isn 't that what you do ? No , I never play that one . You hate this game , don 't you ? You see , we 're not so different , you and I. We stand for the same thing . You want to rid the world of this game and so do I. Look at me when I speak to you . What do you know about this Doctor Louis Zandor ? I told you , butch Barbie . I know nothing . Why are you doing this ? Your friend , Doctor Louis Zandor , designed this game with the floor plans to our base . Don 't you realize what a threat this poses to our homeland security ? So what is this new Eee Tee 2 game you 're selling ? It 's just a game . Well . You have quite the fan base I realize . The gamers are loyal to you . Have them send all their Eee Tee games to me . Join me , Nerd , and this game can be history , forever in the past where it belongs . You have your customers bring in their old Eee Tee games for a discount . You give us the old games , and we 'll make sure that this new game is a success beyond your wildest dreams . I 'd rather lick the shit skid off the inside of a toilet bowl than aid you in your quest for world domination . No ! Well , yes , ha ha ha ha . No ! Get your hands on that filthy game controller , you damn filthy nerd ! Yeah ? Turn it off , you evil son of a bitch . I can never get you every game on the planet . Besides , do you have any idea how many Eee Tee cartridges are still in the public ? And you know what ? You 've already lost because my fans have already found your landfill and dug it up and cleared out all the games . They 're probably at home playing them right now . Ha ha ha ha ha . There 's no playing those games . They 've been smashed into little pieces since I buried them and bulldozed them in the 80s , but you have given me an idea . I see now that your greatest weakness is not the hate you have for that game , but the love you have for your fans . So I 'm gonna blow them all into smithereens ! For someone so interested in protecting Americans , you sure are quick to blow them up . Well , sometimes you have to break a few eggheads in order to make a homeland security omelette ! Ha ha ha ha ha ha . Wait . Doctor Louis Zandor is in that crowd . Good . But he has something of great value to you . Oh , and what might that be ? The Roswell space metal . He stole it because he didn 't want you to rebuild that alien spacecraft . That 's a lie ! We have all the space metal . You have nothing . It 's tinfoil . Tinfoil ? Don 't worry , Nerd . I 'll save you . How am I gonna do that ? Wait a minute . Who are we trying to be here , Pee-wee fucking Herman ? Foil , it 's all foil . Tinfoil . My plans have been foiled , you assholes . Ah ! Damn ! It 's glitching up . Ow , that fucking hurt ! Where 's my space metal ? Only Zandor knows . Zandor , god dammit . Well , I may not be able to blow up your gamers , but I can blow up your precious Atari monument . Stupid Atari . Stupid Mount Fuji . Launch sequence activated . Ha ha ha ha . Ha ha ha ha . So long , Nerd , and thank you for telling the truth . Oh , that smarts . Hey there . Looks like you 're coming with me . No , my hands are tiny . Okay , ah . And away we go ! Ugh ! Whoa ! Damn , dude . You 're heavy . Holy shit . I thought you were just a hoax . Yeah , we get a lot of that around here . Wow . Wait . We 're gonna need this to get out of here . Okay . Oh , shit . Exterminate . Oh , terrific . Killer robots . Exterminate . Here , have a gun . Okay . Must kill nerd . Exterminate . Let 's get out of here . Go go go go go ! Get me Zandor . He 's at the landfill . I want him alive ! Whoa , I hate it when people shoot at me . Fire , fire , fire ! How do you open these doors ? Ahem , down here . Brilliant . Look out ! Hey , hey , hey , works every time . Come on , come on , come on . Go , go , go . How do you shut these doors ? I 'll tell you there . Hurry ! Come on . What are you waiting for ? Shoot them , white arthropod moron . I 'm trying . Excellent shot . Come on , shut these shitty , slow-ass doors . Whoa , nice shooting , Tex . Well done ! Exemplary work . I can 't fly one of those . How about you ? Alright . Nerd , come in . Nerd , come in . Please , Nerd . Fuck this . I 'm going in . Hm hm hm hm . So , outer space , huh ? Yep . Um , so why 'd you come to Earth ? I was looking for intelligent life . Well , you found it . I found life , yes . Oh , that 's funny . No , I came to save you people , but you locked me up for 60 years . I had nothing to do with that . I wasn 't even alive back then . What about my friend Cooper who 's somewhere out in the desert ? What ? Cooper , you know it 's foot massage Friday . Bring your ass home now . I can 't come home right now . I have to drive this van and break in to Area 51 . You don 't even know how to drive no van . What do you mean I don 't know how to drive a van ? We 'll find him , but trust me , we have bigger worries . If you only know what I 'm trying to prevent . Prevent ? You wouldn 't understand . Concerns the entire spectrum of existence . Oh , what ? Like the , the . Megaverse and the Ultraverse ? Yeah . A cyber mutant death god with a satellite dish on his head ? I 've underestimated you . Well , I don 't care . I 'm just trying to save my fans from that lunatic Dark Onward . Well , who 's gonna save your fans from Death Mwauthzyx ? Whoa ! The whole world you live in is a video game . It 's a game that I made . Then you people invented the nuclear bomb . That 's when I came down to settle things ' cause when the game gets out of control , Dad 's gotta take it away . Your dad ? Death Mwauthzyx . If he found out I created a culture of warmongers and xenophobes , all it 'll take from him is one 360 turn from the satellite dish on his head and . Existence as we know it will come to an end . No , it 'll be as if it never existed at all . Just a punishment for me , but a painful apocalypse for you guys . Psyche ! Ha ha ha ha ha . So how do we stop this ? I need my spaceship . That would help . Well , it 's in a million pieces , wherever it is . I can harness their power and join them all back together if only you could find the pieces . Well , Zandor hid them , so he 's the only one who knows . Oh , shit . We got to find him now . Ah ! Dismount ! Back off , Keith . Back up . Back up . Back up . Back up . Attention men . Bring me Doctor Louis Zandor . Find him and bring him to me . You can run but you can 't hide . Ah ! Either we refuel or we land this thing . Well , I don 't even drive a car , so how am I supposed to do this ? These controls don 't make a fuck 's bit of sense . I 'd have an easier time doing a handstand while taking a shit . You want to know what happened to me last time I tried ? Well , you ever see me play Top Gun ? Not a pretty sight . Oh , I 'm gonna be . Oh ! Okay , bitch . Come over here and untie me . Let 's see who can fuck up who . Oh , yeah ? Yeah . Yeah ? Yeah . Hang on , Nerd . I 'm gonna get you out of there . Oh , shit . It 's Death Mwauthzyx . Go ! Fuck you . No , no . Oh , no , no , no . Ah ! Holy shitskies . Alright , bitch . Now I thought I could get through this without objectifying myself in a sexy catfight , but it looks like that 's impossible now . They 're on us . Hurry . Whoa . Did you see that ? Ah ! Ah ! Holy cow ! Oh ! Ah ! Ah ! We are gathered here today to bring together , in holy matrimony , Robert and Lisa . Robert , do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife , to have and to hold , to cherish , love from this day forward ? No . Bobby ? Oh , god . No ! Bobby ! Oh ! Wait , but . Shoot these gamer geeks if they don 't get out of your way . Oh , no . We might be too late . Alright , I 'm going down there . Come on , Nintendo skills . Don 't fail me now . Up , up , down , down , speed up , speed down . I 'm gonna land the plane . I 'm gonna land it . I 'm , fuck it . You did it . I knew you would ! Ha ha ha ha . Back up . Step back . Back up . Back up . Ha ha ha , Zandor . You are mine ! Great , more guns . Just what we needed . Ha ha ha ha . Ha ha ha ha , Zandor . Ha ha ha ha . Look what we go over here . $ 200 either one . Oh . Holy shit . Look at that ! Damn ! I don 't never win nothing . Double zero ? Woo ! Ah ! Hot . Wait a minute . That 's Mandi . No ! Ah ! I will get you ! What the fuck ? Oh , ah ! What the fuck is this shit ? Get off of me ! Chick magnet ! Iii . No . Mandi , it 's me , Cooper . Oh , Cooper , you asshole ! You left me for dead . I 'm so sorry . I just thought you were a double agent . Oh , I 'm not even a single agent . Surrender , Nerd ! You have no place to go . You 're mine now . Nerd ! Zandor . There 's something important I have to tell you . The space metal , the pieces to the ship . I put them in the safest spot imaginable , in the hands of all the children . They 're inside the Eee Tee games . Ingenious . Are you doing this ? I have enough accumulated power now . I can summon them all ! Oh . Oh . Dirty son of a gun . Ah ! God , free me from this game . Go , God . Free me . Thank you , God . Thank you , God ! Ah ha ha ha ! Ho ho ho ho ha ha ! Piece of shit . Ha ha ha ha . What the fuck was that ? Holy shit , dude . It went right out the fucking window . Ha ha ha ha . Oh , man . Oh , let 's play another game . Up we go ! What the hell 's the matter with you ? Are you all a bunch of pussies ? Pick those weapons up . Drive ! Goddamn hypocrite cocksucker ! I 'll teach you not iii . Oh , God ! Oh , oh , oh , shit . Ah ! Whoa ! Don 't worry , Mandi . We 'll get out of here and save you . Ah ! Nerd ! Oh , hey . You came back . Oh , man . I 'm so sorry I ditched you that one time . Yeah , that was a dick move . I know . Cooper , you really turned into a man back there . Thanks , man . Oh , shit ! What the mother fuck is that thing ? Nice to meet you too , babe . Ha , Death Mwauthzyx . See , Nerd ? I told you . You thought I was making it up , huh ? Well , I 'll be damned if all that other stuff you said was true too . None of that 's gonna matter soon if he turns the satellite dish . If he could wipe out all space and time just by turning that satellite dish on his head , then what the hell is he doing playing around in Las Vegas ? That 's how he gets his kicks . I don 't fucking know . I 've known him for 5,000 years and he never got around to it . Imagine if you were Death Mwauthzyx and knew everything there was to know . You would be so bored you 'd go crazy . And if there was one thing that maybe you haven 't thought of in a while , one thing that nobody could ever learn , one indescribable , far-out , unimaginable , fucked up enigma of nature , way , way , way outside the boundaries of existence . Maybe if I could direct his attention to that , he 'll , he 'll go away . It 's kind of like turning on Sunday night football when you want your dad to forget about your weekend chores you were supposed to do , right ? Not even close . I just need a good shot at that satellite dish . I 'll take aim . Get him , Nerd . I 've always wanted to meddle with powers I can 't possibly understand . Whoa , now that 's some heavy-handed symbolism . Go for it ! Ha ha ha ha ha ! What the fuck ? Ha ha ha . You want me to explain ? No , uh-uh . Oh , boy . Yeah ! Yeah , yeah , yeah . You 're a goddamn hero . Not yet . I still have one last thing I have to do . Yes , yes . Oh , Nerd . You don 't owe Cockburn Inc . Anything at this point . Got to stay true to my word . Care to give us an intro ? And now presenting AVGN 's long-awaited review , Eee Tee 2 . He 's the angriest gamer you ever heard . He 's the Angry . Video Game Nerd ! Let 's get this baby fired up . Um , I know we don 't have the original cartridges , but can this ship somehow play the old Eee Tee games ? This ship was the old Eee Tee game . I can reload the bygone data from the circuitry . Yeah . So this is the new Eee Tee 2 , hm . It claims to be even worse than the original . Ugh , look at it . It 's foul , it 's putrid , it 's despicable as it intentionally tries to be , but true wretchedness is too unique to duplicate . The original stood the test of infamy . Why else would you have all come out here in the middle of the desert ? Not to buy a shameless sequel , but to celebrate the most spectacular failure in video gaming history and stand on its unholy grounds . That 's why we 've all gathered here today . And hey , there 's more room in hell now , so let 's make some new history and throw these fuckers in the pit where they belong ! Hey . Hey . So , is birds before nerds okay ? Well , if you got one , don 't let her fly away . Okay . Oh . Damn . Okay , Cooper . Hello , Cooper ? Well , hello to you too , ma . You okay , sugar ? Yes , I 'm fine . I was just in a spaceship with the Nerd . We just saved the universe , okay ? Okay , bye . Bye . See , Nerd ? You 're just like my mom . You 're overprotective . The fans don 't need you to protect them from bad games . They can take care of themselves . Oh , thanks . Yeah , and bingo . Well , everybody , I said once before that I wanted every single cartridge of this game off the face of the Earth . Ad I think I 'm gonna get my wish . But first , you 're gonna get yours . Eee Tee on Atari 2600 . To begin with , it 's not a game you just pick up and play . And most games of this generation were very simple . Shoot a bunch of aliens , climb to the top of the screen , stop missiles or chomp down all the pellets . But Eee Tee is an enigma . With all these random symbols appearing at the top of the screen and falling in holes all the time , it 's no wonder why gamers didn 't understand how to play this game . You have to read the instruction manual . So , once you understand how to play the game , it still fucking sucks ! When the game starts , Eee Tee comes down from space . And now he has to go back ? Why 'd he come down in the first place ? All he had to do was stay on that ship and there wouldn 't be a game . And wouldn 't that be better if Eee Tee just came down and went right back up again ? Was there any colors available besides just green ? The ground is green , the pits are green , and even Eee Tee is fucking green . I feel like I 'm taking a colorblind test . No matter where you go , you fall in pits . They 're fucking everywhere ! You get out by extending your neck which somehow makes Eee Tee float . When in the movie did Eee Tee extend his neck to float out of a pit ? Once you reach the top , most of the time , you just keep falling back in . No , oh fuck ! Oh , wait . Get out of the pit , get out of the pit . Ugh , fuck ! There 's a trick . You got to fuck about with the controls just right . It 's just a really bad learning curve . There 's a way to catch yourself before you fall down , but you 'll never be expecting it when you fall . Oh , look ! Shit . The human brain can 't react that fast . I don 't who can pull off that trick . Maybe ninjas that take speed and sit around and play Atari all day . The goal of the game is to find three hidden pieces of a phone that Eee Tee needs to call home with . And guess where you find them ? In the pits . When you 're walking around , you pass over these invisible spaces which hold special items . When you 're standing on these spaces , you can use them to perform a certain action . For example , if you come across an arrow , you can use that to transport you to the next screen , but half the time , you 're gonna end up on a pit . So if you want to use the arrow , you need to remember what 's on that space on the other screen as if the game is forcing you to think fourth dimensionally . What is this game , for fucking scientists ? It 's marketed like it 's for little kids , and that really shows a lack of communication . Also , the whole game works off a randomizer . All these zones and the phone pieces , everything , they 're always hidden a different spot every time you start the game . Some fans have spoken out in defense of this game , saying that it 's different every time you play it . Kind of like how every time I take a shit , it 's always different . What I really hate are the FBI agents and the scientists . The scientist takes your ass back to the buildings and the FBI agent takes all your phone pieces . What an asshole . Trying to outrun these guys without stepping in the holes is a real pain the ass . Come on , you motherfucker , motherfucker , motherfucker . Come on , ugh . Fuck . And how come they can pass over a hole and you can 't ? Yeah , yeah , go ahead , pass over the hole again . Yeah , fuck you . I 'm gonna pass over your mom 's hole . Even if you find the pieces , it 's worth Jack and shit . And Jack left town . That 's because you need to find the phone home zone also . It looks like a space invader alien , but there 's only one in the entire game . And keep in mind , it 's always someplace different , so you have to trace over every fucking space . It 's like trying to find a needle in a haystack or like a turd in a mudslide . All the senseless running around drains your energy . That 's right , Eee Tee dies from moving around too much . So maybe he 'll find the call zone first . After all , finding the phone pieces are easier because the question mark zone shows what pits they 're in . Got the call zone , but oh fuck , I wasted all my energy . Maybe I 'll find the phone pieces first . Okay , got the phone pieces , but oh shit , the FBI guy took them away . It 's like a big brother who wants to give you a noogie and a wedgie at the same time . And if you do manage to find everything you need in one flawless run , guess what ? You can 't call home unless there 's nobody on the screen . So if the call zone happens to be on the screen where the FBI and scientists are , you 're fucked ! Why does Eee Tee need to be alone when he calls , like a teenage girl ? So when you find the call zone with all the three phone pieces and you phone home , then you got to make your way back to the landing zone . But even worse now , there 's a time limit . You have to be standing on the landing zone at the precise moment at the precise time when the timer runs out . And if an FBI agent or scientist walks into the screen , it doesn 't work . Why does Eee Tee need so much privacy ? Does he need to tug on his little green beam or something ? So , is it really the worst game of all time ? Um , I don 't think so . It 's frustrating , it 's challenging , and it 's a brain teaser , but that 's what makes it so addicting . And considering it was made in such a short period of time , it 's more sophisticated than anything of its era . Raiders of the Lost Ark was just as strange and cryptic and that game was met with glowing praise . Both these games came with instruction manuals . Now I can understand kids just wanting to pick up a game and enjoy it without having to read anything , but if you could understand Raiders , you could understand Eee Tee . So what was it that gave this game such a reputation ? I can 't answer that . It 's just something that happened . It 's something we needed . Is there something mystical about the game ? There is . It 's a floor plan to Area 51 as well as an access key and every cartridge contained a piece of the alien ship . Sure , but forget about all that . The mystical thing about all these old , craptastic games is that they somehow hold a place in our hearts and bring us back to that special time when we were kids . And that 's the power of the classics and the not-so-classics that we love to hate . See you later .

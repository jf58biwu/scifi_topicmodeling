 I 'm sorry . Tom , it is time for your daily reminders . Begin when you like . My name is Tom Jacobs . Born November 12th , 1972 . My parents are Mark and Judith . My wife is Abby . I would give anything to hear her say my name right now . I 'm a prisoner of my own creation . I 'm bored again , Minnie . - What would you like to do now , Tom ? Let 's go some place else . - Locating , six minutes to enter . So , what now ? I mean , he 's in , right ? This was it . He was completely blown away . We don 't have to live in that fucking garage anymore , no more scrounging for grant money ! Remember when I first asked you out , I said , Trust me when they 're going to pay off . Then you told me you had a boyfriend . I never said that . - Yeah , you did . No , I didn 't ! - Okay , you 're right , I 'm wrong . What is this ? - Open it . We can 't afford this . - Not yet . We will . I want you to wear it tonight . I want you to be there with me . Both of you . Five minutes , left . Tom . - So , we have an offer . Oh , that 's fantastic . - Well , let 's not get too excited . They need to know how accurate the machine is . For instance , how do we handle false memories ? The machine acts like a synapse polygraph . It can tell the difference between real and fake . The line gets blurry when it comes to brainwashing , but I 've got a way around that . If the person has been brainwashed , and they have a latent memory that brainwashing 's taken place so ... hypnosis , cult programming , I don 't know , bad people drilling things into your head , the machine cross-checks for those moments first , and if it doesn 't find them , then the memory 's real . Listen , the client has an idea . Very simply put , what if you could go into other people 's memories ? What would be the point of that ? - What do you want , possibilities ? Go into a kid 's memory , find out if he 'd been abused . Go into an Alzheimer 's ... I 'm glad we 're redefining the machine 's function , but Richard , I was clear about what I wanted . I 'm just saying , you could do that , right ? . - It 's irrelevant . You 're my rep , go sell the machine I wanted , not something else . I tried . I pitched it . This was the idea they threw back . Who threw this back ? - Everyone ! You are not going to get the kind of money you want unless you 're willing to compromise a little bit . If you want to just help people , you can do that for free . What was the offer ? It 's unethical ! - It 's just a presentation . You built this machine to help expose trauma . It 's not going to change anything . It still can do that . - They 're just going to let you call the shots ? To get at what I have ? Of course they will . - This is how it starts . We 're drowning in debt , we 're about to start a family , so what do you want me to do ? - We 'll get by . I don 't deserve to just get by ! Three minutes to render . 450,000 The First of Many I come bearing money . That going to be enough to get you started ? Yeah , that 's going to be enough . I 'd like to know who this investor is . Someone who knows potential . At the end of the day , you own the rights , you have control . Now , he has a couple questions about the changes . The machine I used seemed to work fine . Why build a whole other one ? General upgrades . The current program requires that an outside user gets you around . I want you to be able to go anywhere you want to go once you 're inside , on your own . So , I emerge inside the memory ... - Richard , can you hear me ? Yeah , Tom , I can hear you ! - Isn 't that how it works ? No , not exactly . We need to be able to sort through the memories from a neutral spot . So we 're creating a virtual command center inside the mind of the patient , a starting point , somewhere to go . All right , starting zone , what 's it going to look like ? - How about this place ? This house ? - Yeah . Just as a placeholder , until we get something more involved . More interesting ? - Yeah . All right . Okay , I 'll start capturing it . We 're going to need a voice . - I 'll do it . What ? - Why don 't we give it a little flair ? Maybe hire an actress ? They 'll like that . I 'd like it . You don 't think my voice has flair ? - No . Yay - Yah - Yo How 's that one ? - Works for me , let 's just move on to the Z 's then we 're done . How 's it looking ? - Zah - Zo - Zay ... Stunning . - I 'm talking about the voice , lover boy . Right , that too . Your memory is ready , Tom . Your memory is ready , Tom . - Let 's go . So , I 'm in the starting point , I find a memory I want to go to , and I 'm there ? Simple as that ? - Simple as that . How far can you go inside the memory ? - As far as the memory will allow . Temporary borders pop up at the memory 's edge , a fence that you can 't get past . You shouldn 't have to , anyway . This entire world is an amalgamation of things that actually exist . Things that the machine randomly generates , anything from everyday items to people . And as for you , you 'll leave no lasting impression on this world . It 's like you 're not even there . Okey , one last question . How do I get out ? - User extracts you . Okay , what if something goes wrong ? We 'll work it out . Minnie ? - Yes , Tom ? Self-destruct , please . Self-destructing in five , four three , two , one . Goodbye , Tom . Self-destruct has failed , Tom . I must remind you , I am not evil . Shall I diagnose it again ? How long have I been trapped here , Minnie ? - 4 years , 2 months , 2 days . Are you ready ? I don 't know if I have a life beyond this place . I don 't know if anyone knows I exist . Daddy come home Hello ? It 's Richard . Hello ? Tomorrow night ? We were supposed to have another six weeks , Tom . There 's been some changes , apparently the window on investment is closing . They need a presentation right now . There 's a laundry list of things we haven 't tested . There 's still placeholders in there for God 's sakes , unfamiliar faces . - Use yourself . Okay , what about photos , pictures ? - Details . Just fill them in with something , anything . Richard knows we 're under the gun . All right , but I 'm objecting , on the record , and saying we should have at least another month to test these . Well your objection is noted . Now let 's get to work . Ready ? - Yeah . I love you . - I love you . Wait for me . Where do you want this ? - Just put it down there . Who is this ? Who 's your investor ? It 's uh , complicated . Complicated ? Then uncomplicate it , Richard . Who the hell 's the investor ? Arthur Kennison , Department of Corrections . The idea is , you go into the memories of an accused man , see if he did the crime or not . Assured culpability . Is this something they volunteer for ? No . If it works , it would be mandatory . Bravo on the fucking 180 , pal . - Let 's just all relax ... - I can pack this up in 10 minutes . Stay out of this . - I know who signed my fucking checks . - I trusted you . You knew who the client was all along and kept your mouth shut for six months . - I told you , it 's someone who sees potential . That 's not a lie . I am trying to give you a chance . - Bullshit , you 're giving yourself a chance . Maybe I want a chance . Maybe I want an opportunity to be part of something great . You got to understand something . You 're not the only one working on this . You 're the first , but how long does that last ? I had a vision of this thing , but this is not it . - This is not about your vision . It 's about control ! You honestly think you could take these people 's money with no consequence ? How long have you been working on this ? Think about that . Think about your family , Tom . Mr. Jacobs ? Are we going to do this ? Let 's begin . Who are we entering ? - We picked him up a few weeks ago . His name is Anthony Willis . Son of some two-bit retired mob middleman . What 'd he do ? - Kid 's a verifiable junkie . One day he 's at home shooting up , gets a text from his girlfriend , drives over to her sister 's house , and kills her . Allegedly . Says he blacked out . You make sense of this guy 's mind , then you 'll have my attention . You force him to come here ? - Force him ? He jumped at the chance to volunteer . He 's a perfect guinea pig . Willing and expendable . Seems like a super guy . It 's just a sedative . The whole process won 't hurt a bit . Maybe not for me . It 's a wild ride up there . Just give it a few seconds . Why put him out ? - Sedating him will help keep things stable . Tom ? We 're just about ready . I 'm going to need those details . If the program works , it should tell me what happened , no ? We 're looking for an exact memory amongst millions . I 'm going to need something . All right , I 'll bite . Kid 's case file . An anonymous tip came in , someone saw his pickup truck pull over by a bridge near the murder scene around 2 a.m. About an hour after we estimated she died . We searched the area and found the murder weapon with his prints . Let 's get started . That all right ? Good luck . Tom , can you hear me ? Tom , can you hear me ? Tom , can you hear me ? I can hear you . - Minnie , can you hear me ? Welcome , Tom . My name is Minnie . What would you like to do ? Minnie , put up everything I see on the main screen . - As you wish , Tom . Coming through crystal clear . - Good . Minnie , locate memories with the following descriptions : Adrienne ; murder ; Regan . Locating . One memory found with these specifics . Take me there , Minnie . From Adrienne 703-244-0212 Message : I can 't be more in your life anymore . Received on : 12 : 31pm , April 25 2013 I 'm in . Adrienne , open up ! That doesn 't look familiar . - The placeholder . The machine will fill in the gaps . How long until something ... I 'm sorry . Minnie , what percentage of this memory is real ? - Processing . Background authenticity accounts for 17 % . It 's weak but not abnormal for that . What about his actions ? 95 % - 95 . It 's extremely solid for memory . Dad , something bad happened . The memory has ended , Tom . Now that 's how we pieced it together . Kid took a methadone hit to calm down , called dad , left the scene , and ditched the gun . So he was lying about not remembering ? He may not have consciously remembered . Long blackouts are not unusual for addicts . Which may also explain why he 's so convinced he 's innocent . I got to say I 'm very impressed , Tom . Gary , get me out of here . Goodbye , Tom . What the hell ? Welcome Tom . What you want to do now ? Gary , I 'm back in the hub . That 's weird . Let 's try that again . Goodbye , Tom . Welcome , Tom . What would you like to do now ? It didn 't work . What is going on ? What is happening ? - The extraction isn 't working ... Just fix it ! Says some kind of miscommunication ... He 's working on it . Tom just put the whole thing away . Let 's figure this out later . All right , and no " I told you so " when I get out . - Like hell . Minnie , self-destruct . - Are you sure ? Yeah . Self-destructing in five , four , three , two , one ... Goodbye , Tom . When does he wake up ? - It should be now . It self-destructed . Chip comes apart , disintegrates in the bloodstream . Yeah , it 's gone . So why is he still out ? Tom , can you hear me ? Tom can you hear me ? Tom ? He 's not listening to me . I didn 't do it . You were shooting up . You took the gun from her hand ... Look at it , Anthony . Look at what you 've done . I didn 't do this ! - Shut up ! You 've been spinning on wheels for three days . Confess already ! You took the gun , you put it to her head , and you fucking blew her away , BAM ! You have visitors . Hi , Dad . You look thin . Been eating ? Yeah , you know . I wanted to drop this off . Cleared out the attic , found some pictures . Thanks . They started a carpentry class here last week . I 've been going to that . It 's real interesting . I can see myself doing that . You look really thin . You said that already , Dad . I 'm not using , if that 's what you think . They 're cracking down , you can 't even slip it in anymore . That 's what you say , Anthony , but ... - I don 't believe this . What are you doing ? - Satisfied ? Don 't you cop an attitude with me , boy . Your job in here is to clean up . I did it . Don 't you fuck it up . I give you my word . Doesn 't that mean anything ? Not to me . It 's always good talking to you , Dad . Sit ! Just sit ! Dad , how do I get him to sit ? - I told you , Anthony . Repetition . If you want to get that dog to sit , you got to push his ass down while you keep repeating it . Sit ! Boy , give me the 9 / 16 " . That 's 5 / 8 " . - That 's 5 / 8 " . I 'm sorry . You know , we got to think about buying your mom a birthday present . A car ? - A car ? Yeah . - Are you crazy ? Minnie , how many times have I been in this memory ? - 430 times . 430 times . Must be the allure of music . What 's the date out there , anyway ? - July 15th . Shit , we missed the fireworks . Tomorrow we 're going to have to track down some sort of celebratory event . Picnic , barbecue ... What do you think ? I do not understand the query , Tom . Of course not . I 'd like that , though . Sit ! Anthony , I told you a hundred times , that dog is dumb as shit . Go get your old man a beer . Minnie , what the hell was that ? He looked right at me . He saw me ! That is not possible , Tom . - Don 't tell me it 's impossible , he saw me . Anthony . Anthony ! Look at me ! Thank you , my boy . Am I going crazy here , Minnie ? He saw me , I know he did . Your theory is impossible . Start the memory over . Start from right before he asks for the beer . Restarting . Sit ! Anthony , I told you a hundred times , that dog is dumb as shit . Go get your old man a beer . Anthony ! Look at me ! Can you see me ? Anthony ! Thank you , my boy . He was looking at me , Minnie , I know he was . He was looking right at me . The process has been repeated three times . Your theory does not seem plausible . What was it that was so special about that particular memory ? What was so special at that specific time ? Minnie , what time was it when I claimed that Anthony spotted me ? I cannot verify the precise time that memory took place . No , the real time , in reality . The time was 4 : 15 , July 15th . I want you to show me the memory of what Anthony was doing at that exact time . Scanning short-term memory . Look ! You see me right now , Anthony ? Lights out in five minutes . He was thinking about that memory . He was thinking about the memory at the same time that I was in it . An active memory . That 's how he saw me , Minnie . - I can not verify your theory , Tom . You don 't have to verify it . Anthony 's Photos We need to meet him again . Minnie , I need to see the memory he thinks of the most . - I can not locate memories by frequency of access . What about discussion of frequency , any mention of things he can 't stop thinking about ... a therapy session , a confessional ? Locating . I think about it all the time . I was hanging out with a friend of mine . A part-time dealer named Eric Lowe . A real loose character . Take me to this memory , Minnie . I was desperate for a fix . I needed some cash , and I had only one place I knew I could get it . How much longer we got to wait here ? I gotta get this truck back to my brother , or he 's going to knock the fucking shit out of me . There he goes . - You sure he 's got it with him ? Yeah , he 's coming from his bookie . All right . What the fuck is that ? You going to jack him with your shoe ? - Give it to me then . Fuck off . - Give it to me ! Take it . Fucking asshole . - Easy , boss . Let 's fucking do it . Money . Hand it over . - Do you know who you 're fucking with ? No . Why don 't you tell me who I 'm fucking with ? Don 't make me cut you open , old man . What the fuck are you doing ? - What the fuck are you doing ? I want to see your face before I blow it up , you dumb fuck . - Dad . Dad ? That day haunts me . How low he knew I 'd sunk . I 'd start thinking about Adrienne . What kind of person I can be when I 'm controlled by the things I 'm controlled by . Despite the evidence , my history , the cops , my own father ... I can 't see myself doing it . Not to her . Nobody can see that but me . Fuck if that 's not agony . Anthony ... I didn 't earn it . - I 'm giving it to you because I want you to earn it . Consider this a contribution to the new you . You 've reached the end of this memory , Tom . What would you like to do now ? We wait here . Keep repeating this memory until he shows up . Hey , Minnie , how long have I been here ? - Two weeks , Tom . You see me . You see me , don 't you ? Do you recognize me ? My name is Tom , Tom Jacobs . Do you remember me ? I know you can hear me . Minnie , you 're seeing this , right , I 'm not ahllucinating ? - Yes , Tom . I know you can hear me . Come on , speak to me . What did you say ? Enough . What did you say ? Talk to me . - I said , enough ! What the hell 's the matter with you ? Anthony ? Anthony ! Anthony ! What would you like to do now , Tom ? We keep waiting . Welcome back . Can you hear me ? - Yeah . Yeah . Good . Good , that 's great . It 's very important that you understand everything that I 'm about to say . I 've been trapped in here for over four years . My wife 's name is Abby Jackobs . I can still remember her last number . If you want me out of here , Anthony , then I need you to call her and tell her where I am . She 's not going to believe you , so I 'm going to tell you everything you need to say to her . If we get cut off , all you need to do is just think of this place , and I 'll be here waiting . Abby . Abby ? Abby ! ? You okay ? - Yeah , I just got lost in my thoughts for a second . I hope you don 't take this the wrong way , but this is our third date , you know ? Maybe it 's just a misfire . No , I just had a bit of a day . Bear with me ? You know what ? Let 's reschedule . I will check in at work , and I will give you a call . All right ? - That 'd be great . Hello ? - Is this Abby Jacobs ? Yes , this is . My name is Anthony Willis . Can I help you ? I spoke to your husband . Creep . Hey , look , if you 're trying to be funny , maybe we can get the police in on this joke . Your father died of a stroke when you were 23 . Tom was your boyfriend at the time . You told him you couldn 't bear to watch your father be put in a box , so you ran off to the beach . When Tom showed up , you told him to go , but he wouldn 't . You hid under blankets , and he talked to you until the sun went down . At two in the morning , that 's where he asked you . And you told him he had the worst timing you 'd ever seen . You asked him why he 'd ever want a nut like you ... And he said , he 'd take whatever he could get , as long as it was you . Even the smallest fragment ... would be enough . I can see everything you do seconds after you do it , in short-term memory . She believed you . Which means that she 's going to come down here to see you . Now there 's still a few things that I need you to tell her . I think I know what went wrong that day , and how to fix it . Anthony , I know everything about you . You played soccer as a kid . You were named after your uncle . Your friend gave you your first vicodin when you were just 14 years old . I 've seen the best and the worst of you . I 've seen your crimes . I 've also seen regret . This is your chance to do the right thing . Will you help me ? You think I want you roaming around in here ? I want to believe you . I do . Maybe there 's another way to explain what you know . So I have a question . If you can really speak to him , you should be able to answer me . What do you want to know ? His nickname for me . - Ma 'am , you 've got five minutes . Thank you . Are you still there ? I can 't just speak to him . We have a place where we meet . I 'm sure he 's watching this memory right now , about to give me the answer . He can see all of this ? - Yes , he can see anything I can see . This is his daughter , Donna . Take me to the meeting place , Minnie . - Locating . Can you see him or not ? - I don 't see him yet . I don 't know what I 'm doing here . - Wait . If you were trying to make a fool out of me , you succeeded . - Wait , just give me a second ! Birdie ! He calls you Birdie . I could live in that memory forever . All right , write this down . If I 'm still here , it means the chip is still physically inside you . My guess is a malfunction during the self-destruct damaged the chip . I looked , though . It was gone . - Not all of it , according to Tom . Why didn 't it come up on the reader ? The reader traces the chips by the metallic elements that comprise them . The chips of my prototype were made of sililcone . The new chips were upgraded to monocrystalline , that 's why it didn 't read . In all the rush , I never reprogrammed the damn reader . It would 've taken me minutes . It 's not your fault . - So what now ? I got clearance to get Tom out of the hospital . - What about Anthony ? It 's Richard . - It 's Richard ? He still has an in at the department of corrections . He said he 'd help . - Hey . Yeah , Abby , it 's Richard . Listen , I just spoke with him . He 's not going for it . I couldn 't get him to budge . - So what does this mean , it 's over ? No , I said I couldn 't get him to budge . - I don 't understand . I 'm saying even I have my priorities . I 'm going to send you his information . - You corner him , Abby . Nobody is going to fight for your husband the way you will . I 've got a ranch nearby . I guess I could put in for a prison transfer , have him sequestered there overnight , get a few guards who won 't talk . If I was properly motivated . What does that mean ? The machine , Mrs. Jacobs . How about you sign it over to me ? I understand this might be a difficult decision for you . Well then , you know nothing about me . Get it done . I 've got to be honest . It 's kind of hard being comfortable , knowing you may be watching . If you get out , you 've got to promise to keep a few things quiet . I mean , it gets kind of lonely in this cell sometimes . I don 't want people judging me , you know . Yeah . You know what ? I hate this fucking place . How about we pick another spot ? Come on , you big baby , come with me . - Nobody 's stopping you . So you 're just going to sit around and do nothing ? Maybe I just want to sit here and watch you . Fine . Last chance . Come on , you big baby ! Get in . Come on . Took you long enough . Nice place . A weekend getaway we got . I think we 'd been going out about four months by this point . Have you been here before ? It 's hard to tell . The line kind of got blurry . I 'm not sure what 's mine and what 's yours anymore . This one 's definitely mine . This is a , uh ... better place . Remember the last time we met ? You said it wouldn 't hurt a bit . It 's been hurting ever since . Why 'd you build this thing , man ? I don 't know anymore . I think I was going to help people . Let them revisit the past , to deal with their traumas . Make the world a better place . Cliche , huh ? Somewhere along the way , I kind of lost my focus . This became less about what I put into it , and more about what I got out of it . You regret it ? Every day . Can 't change the past . But hey , maybe that 's your next invention . I 'd buy a ticket . I 'm leaving tonight . They 're taking me out of this place . - Just like that ? Where the hell are you going ? They 're going to hold me up some place for the procedure . Said it 's all painless , just , uh ... computers and machines doing most of the work . So I just got to be there for the night , then I 'm out the next day . If he tries anything , we 're within earshot . And then what ? Transfer to another prison . - Wonderful . That 's just fucking great . - This guy needs my help . I told you years ago , Anthony , not to volunteer for this program . I was trying to prove my innocence . " Your innocence . " That night you called me , you told me everything . You may not remember , but I do . Dad ! Something bad happened . I had to hitch a ride to pick up your sorry ass . I had to watch my own son OD in the backseat while I cleaned up his fucking mess . I kept my mouth shut to the cops for you . You know , you were doing just fine right where you are . Now they 're taking you to God-knows-where . - I 'm not going to start up again . Don 't sell me your bullshit , Anthony . All it takes is one slip-up , one corrupt system , and you 're back to your old habits . I 'm trying to do a good thing ! You haven 't done a good thing in your entire life . And now you 're all angry , aren 't you ? And I 'm such a bad father , because I don 't believe you ? I pulled your ass out of the fire more times than I can remember , but I 'm done now , Anthony . You may hate me . But everything I 've done ... I 've done for you . You really still believe you 're innocent ? I do . Prove it . Shit . He was right . So what 's this , then ? This is what I need to build . Every chip has a source frequency . This will send out a signal every quarter of a second to retrieve that frequency . Once we lock on to Tom 's signal , we 're going to need you to tell us what memory he 's in , and tell him to stay there . We 'll filter that memory through the console , bring Tom 's body in , and make the swap . You sure this is going to work ? Well Richard , your guess is as good as mine , and that 's the best we 've got . How long ? We 'll start within the hour . The whole process shouldn 't take more than four hours , total . Actually ... it may take a bit longer than that . What do you mean ? You need me . I 've got a request for Tom . I know he 'll probably see this . Tom , I feel I 've been more than accommodating , wouldn 't you agree ? I have something I want from you . I want to find out what happened the night of the murder . I saw what happened . You killed your girlfriend . There 's something else from that night , something the cops shrugged off as me trying to save my own ass . I want to prove myself . I want to prove them wrong . We don 't have time for this . - Make time ! I want to make sure he 's listening first . I want to make sure he 's on board . Tom ... I 'll be waiting to hear your response . You lied to me . You want me in here for the rest of your life ? You killed her , isn 't that enough ? - I 've done a lot of horrible things , but I 'm no killer . Why start with her ? - Maybe she broke up with you , you were on a bender , maybe in your fucked-up state , you let her have it . What do you mean " maybe " ? I thought you could see everything ! - I can see actions , not emotions . Then all you 're seeing is a fucking picture-book . You don 't know how I feel , you don 't know what she meant to me . You can 't bluff me , Anthony . You 're no angel . Every time you got angry , every time you swung after a few drinks , every time you threatened someone , I saw that . And those are actions ! - Who the hell doesn 't have skeletons in their closet ? All you know is my history , not me . I know myself . Really ? What part of yourself do you know ? There 's the guy I 'm talking to right now , then there 's the guy with a needle in his arm . The cops think you did it . Your father thinks you did it . Fuck , I think you did it . So what , we 're all wrong ? The evidence is wrong ? I 'm wrong ? You did it , Anthony . So , what 's the point ? The point is , there is something else that happened that night . An incident with another man . I want to fill in the gaps , I want to find out who he is . Chasing down a random memory is a needle in a haystack . - I 'll tell you everything I can remember ... I 'll guide you through it . - Even if someone else was there , the fact remains , you killed her . Not accidentally . Not in self-defense . When the ends are this gruesome , do the means really matter ? - They matter to me . Did you think there wouldn 't be a price for your freedom , Tom ? I guess I thought I was dealing with a decent man . We all make mistakes now , don 't we ? I may be a guinea pig to people like you , but from here on out , you 're going to do what I say , ' cause I 'm your only chance of going home . You 've got until the morning , before I get transferred . If you want my help , you help me first . Abby , there 's been a slight delay . No cause for alarm . Tom 's there ? - Yeah , he got here about an hour ago . Good . Just sit tight , and I 'll call you when it clears up here . Okay . Let 's begin . Tell me about Adrienne . Anything you can . We were together for two years . She wasn 't exactly a piece of cake from the start . Fucked-up home life , suicide attempt at 16 . When we met , I got her started on the harder stuff . At first , we were just messing around . Then she ... she became everything to me . I wanted to pull us back because we were killing each other , you know ? But she couldn 't pull back . No matter how hard I tried I couldn 't help her . Then one day , she just left , didn 't say why , didn 't take my calls . Then I went into a downward spiral . The next time I saw her , she was dead . We 've got a signal . Now we 're just waiting on you two . The clock 's ticking . You said something else happened that night . Tell me everything you can remember . Minnie , get ready to locate these . I remember waking up in the tub after hearing a large crash . Like glass shattering . I had a bottle of pills by me , and Adrienne 's gun . My head 's throbbing . I don 't know how long I 've been out . The place is new to me . I remember pictures on the mantle . In the guest bedroom , there was a couch , TV , don 't remember what was on . And on the bookshelf , an alarm clock . I heard a noise , turned around . Blackout . Didn 't even have enough time to pull my gun . Minnie , bring up the attacker . Placeholders . Placeholders everywhere . The memory 's only 5 % accurate . It 's impossible to know the context . You don 't remember who you saw , you can 't even remember the area . - But the memory is real ? Yeah , it 's real . - Then you 've got to keep digging . Meet me there . Just look again . - I looked three times . You woke up in a generic bathroom , there were placeholders right down to the products and the magazines . The attacker is a dead end . There 's just not enough , what do you want me to do ? I don 't remember mentioning any magazines . - It doesn 't matter that you didn 't mention them . They were there . You remember them , you just don 't remember the type . That 's the thing though , now that you mention it , I do remember the type , they were skin mags . - No , I would have noticed that . They were generic . You 're confused with another memory . - Am I ? Minnie , how accurate is this photo ? - 100 % . Memory triggers . Mneumonics . They teach you these in grade school . You have seven-course meal , you don 't remember any of it , but if I tell you you had steak , that might trigger you to remember you had potatoes . The memory unravels , doors start to open , all it takes is this tiny little trigger . Now Anthony , it 's not enough for me to decipher your thoughts from a distance , I need you to share them with me . We have to do this together . So you sit here and you focus . Anthony , I 'm going to tell you everything I see , and I need you to give me something back . It 's all in there , I " m just going to bring it to your attention . The first thing is ... This wasn 't a skin mag . What was it , Anthony ? It was an ink mag . The rest of them were ink mags , too . That 's right . Good . Anthony , something else just opened up . It 's a ... purple bottle ? Perfume bottle . There were perfume bottles all over that counter . Good . The rug , Anthony , tell me , what color was it ? It was red , I think , or orange . - It was red . Red , that 's right . The towels were red , too . Red and black . What about the picture frame ? - A drawing ... a train . The shower curtain , that was the first thing I saw . It was odd ... It had a weird pattern on it . Spots . The whole bathroom was pristine . It all matched . You 're remembering . Let 's see what else you remember . Minnie , keep me updated on percentages . - Memory 25 % accurate . Anthony , there 's something else here . The photos in the hallway , there 's one , it 's a drawing . Soldiers . - 35 % accurate . Anthony , that 's not all you remember . There 's a whole room in here now . - There 's a pink blanket on the couch . Pictures on the wall , there 's a hat , a coffee table with a book on it , by the book there 's a wall . There 's a bookshelf . The TV 's on . A cartoon 's playing . Anthony , the clock keeps changing time . What time is it , Anthony ? Come on , Anthony , think . What time is it ! ? 1 : 35 . Minnie , reset this memory . Anthony , if you can remember all these little things ... I know you can remember the big one . Why was he at the house ? I wish I knew , but the memory 's authentic . And the time , 1 : 35 . That 's around when the cops estimate she died . What if he did it ? He was there . - Anthony , I saw you do it . Maybe you 're wrong ! - I 'm not wrong . I did my part , it 's time to keep up your end of the bargain . Tell Garrett that I 'll be waiting for him at our meeting spot . A deal is a deal . I 've got to take a leak . Can I bum one of those ? Shit . Drop the gun . Toss it ! Keys ! Give me the keys ! Anthony , think this through . They 're going to come after you ! If you get killed , you kill Tom ! Come on , Anthony . Where are you ? I 'm coming . Holy shit ! When did you get out ? - Not too long ago . Come in . Fucking forever , man . Want a little pick-me-up ? It 's on the house . Very funny , asshole . You were at Adrienne 's house that night . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Fuck ! Tell me you weren 't at your sister 's house the night she died . Look who 's memory 's coming back . - Why 'd you kill her ? You are fucking crazy ! - Don 't you fucking lie to me ! I didn 't fucking kill her ! I was there , but I didn 't do anything . I walked into the room , she was dead already . I heard footsteps , I hid , and I saw you ! With a gun . I panicked , I hit you . The cops never questioned me , you never pointed me out . What the fuck was I supposed to do ? Why were you at her house ? Why do you think ? She 'd have never shacked up with you . Oh , really ? Why do you look so shocked ? You got her started . It 's your fault she had to come to me . What do you mean , she had to come to you ? Well , we had a certain ... arrangement . I kept her fixed and she gave me what I needed . Guilt . That 's why she broke it off with you . She really wanted to tell you . But , you know what I think ? I think you drove over to her house that night ... just a fucked-up mess . I think she told you everything . And you blew her away for it . I 'm sorry . Don 't move . Give me the gun . All this for a girl . I thought we were friends , man . What do you want to do now ? Call the cops . - We can 't bring the cops here , man . Damn . You know , he 's right . What the hell ... ? Listen ... If it makes you feel any better , she really , really wanted to stop . She did . The problem was ... I got strung out on her . I told her if she ever broke our deal ... I 'd put a bullet in her head . So thanks for doing the dirty work for me . Fuck ! Minnie , locate everything that 's happening right now . Minnie ? - My name is Minnie . What would you like to do ? I said , locate everything that 's happening right now . - Locating . - Subject compromised . Why did you do it ? I was so close . I was right there . - Sys-sys-system wipeout . Talk to me , you coward ! Look at me ! You 've got to get me out of here , Anthony . Something 's wrong with Minnie . You promised me . What are you gonna do now ? Look at me ! What are you gonna do now ? I 'm going to do what 's in my best interest . Your prototype still works , right ? - Yeah . I can go back to your partner and join your wife . She can explain it to me . Tell me everything . Let 's get this done . Begin Extraction ... Okay , it 's done . Tell me what to do . - He said he 'll be waiting for me . Pull him out on my signal . Can you see him yet ? Shit , I lost him . - What do you mean , you 've lost him ? ! Anthony ? I don 't see him . Where 'd you go ? No , no , no ! Why am I here , Minnie ? - I do not understand . Filtering . Don 't filter , Minnie , listen to me . I need to go to another memory . - Are you positive ? Anthony ? Stay with me , okay ? Minnie , I need to go to one more memory . Take me now ! - What would you like to do , Tom ? This is his daughter , Donna . - I could live in that memory forever . I know where he 's going . - You 've arrived . Come on , Tom . Anthony , come here . Stay with me , okay ? - Welcome , Tom . What you want to do ? Anthony , come here ! Look at me right now . Tell me what you want me to do . Come on , Tom . Tell me what to do ! Took you long enough . - Goodbye , Tom . Can you take it from here ? You got some place better to be ? Last chance . My name is Tom Jacobs . Born November 12th , 1972 . My parents are Mark and Judith . My wife 's name is Abby . I would give anything to hear her say my name again . Tom ? Tom ? My father was in the war . He didn 't believe in psychology ... or post-traumatic stress . He used to say that war is like going to the beach . You 're going to come back home with some sand . This was his 15th birthday . Rex . I remember this dog so well , it feels like it was mine . It was a show dog . Rex was a show dog ? What are you talking about ? You couldn 't even teach the dog to sit , he 'd crap all over the house , chew up the furniture . You sound like my kid . What are you talking about ? I gave him away because another trainer made me a great offer . I told Anthony it was acting up when he was in school , shitting all over the place . You tell a kid something enough times , he 'll believe you . This dog was misbehaving . Anthony saw it , I saw it . Anthony didn 't see shit . Rex was a great dog . Are you sure you remember ? Are you ? I 'm going to get another beer . You want one ? - No , I 'm good . Thanks . Dad , how do I get him to sit ? - I told you , Anthony . Repetition . You tell a kid something enough times , he 'll believe it . - Sit ! Anthony ! I 've told you a hundred times . That dog is dumb as shit . - Sit ! The line gets blurry when it comes to brainwashing , but I 've got a way around that . What constitutes brainwashing ? Hypnosis , cult programming . Can it really be defined ? Bad people drilling things into your head ? - Sit . It 's not that obvious . Maybe his dog wasn 't stupid . Maybe Anthony was just conditioned to believe he was . - Sit . Good boy . There are thousands of ways to manipulate someone . Some as innocent as a father talking to his son . If Anthony could have been convinced of that , what else could he have been convinced of , from the cops mapping it out ... to his father 's disappointment . - I 'm giving you my word . Doesn 't that mean anything ? - Not to me . What else could he have believed to be true ? I 'm sorry . An anonymous tip came in . Someone saw his pickup truck pull over by a bridge ... near the murder scene around 2 a.m. You were the anonymous tip . It was you who wrote the letter , wasn 't it ? - What the hell are you talking about ? Don 't play games with me . You set him up , so what do you know ? It doesn 't matter now . - It matters . It matters to me . Anthony called you that night . What did he tell you ? Yeah , he called me . Babbling incoherently . Sounded like another lie . These addicts , they lie . That 's what they do . How could you ? He was your own kid . - He was out of control . So you were what , protecting yourself ? - I was protecting him ! The way he was going , his addiction ... It was only a matter of time before he was found facedown in an alley somewhere . So when he woke up the next morning , and he told me he didn 't remember anything , ... that 's when I made my decision . I set him up . I came out of the joint clean . Do you have a kid ? Yeah . - What would you have done ? Guilt is a powerful thing . It compels , it becomes an obsession . You have a choice : you can either wallow in it , or ... or you can change . I think in her case , she felt like she couldn 't do either . What if he actually convinces people to pull the switch ? I don 't know why I let you look . Old habits die hard , I guess . I understand . How 's that work ? Sometimes you just need to hear a familiar voice .

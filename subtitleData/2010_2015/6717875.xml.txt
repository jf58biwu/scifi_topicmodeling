 You cannot see me with your present eyes , but I give to you a divine eye . Behold my omnipotent power ! DAWN The One . The incomprehensible . Creator . Sustainer of the World . You alone I worship and you alone I seek help . My eyes saw you then . Lead me on the right path . To you I carry these Stones . How long have you been following me ? How long have you been following me ? I don 't know . Don 't come closer . Put down the knife . Show your face . What has driven you out here ? I have been sent . From where ? What does that mean ? You need water . Come . The universe is dead . Death does not concern us , as long as we live , the death is not here . When it comes , we are no longer . You said you were sent , are you banished ? Why are you here ? I have always been here . Therefore , I must stay . Where is this spring ? We are there soon . The One . The incomprehensible . Creator . Sustainer of the World . You alone I worship and you alone I seek help . My eyes saw you then . Lead me on the right path . To you I carry these Stones . There is a place out here that never ceases to amaze me . A strange cliff . To approach it is dangerous . It emits a horrible sound . Where is it ? I 'm going that way . I saw you last night . You would not understand . Tell me . For 10 winters ago I was attacked by a vision . I saw , a stormy wind . A large dense cloud . And out from the storm it was something that did not look like anything I had ever seen before . It had no face , no form . I don 't know what I saw . And there was a voice , an unknown language . My eyes saw something that day , but I can neither describe how it was or what it looked like . It was not meant for human eyes . And since that day - - I have been haunted by a cruel dream . I think it will never let go . Take me to the place you described . Here , no further . Three days you 're there . No water . The One . The incomprehensible . Creator . Sustainer of the World . You alone I worship and you alone I seek help . My eyes saw you then . Lead me on the right path . To you I carry these Stones . Why are you not helping me ? Hear my scorn . Hear my mockery . Listen my contempt of you . May this day perish , this day - - Let it be darkness ; nor light shine upon it . Let gloom and deep darkness claim it . This day-let thick darkness seize it . Behold , let this day be barren ; let no joyful cry enter it . Let those who curse days curse this day , Let the stars of its dawn be dark . Water . Water . Don 't take the stones . What is this ? Why do you have these ? Water . Water . Why do you have these ? Why are you not helping me ? Why don 't you tell me ? Don 't take the stones . English subtitles by Anders Elsrud Hultgreen

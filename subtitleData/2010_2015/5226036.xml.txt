 1x04 - Eye Spy Maybe I should learn to fly . It 's not too late , right ? I could learn . What do you like best ... the freedom ? The view ? The solitude . Got it . See you in Sweden . I only get one shot . And it has to knock a person back , as well as out . Which is why we 're perfecting this little beauty . .45-caliber cartridges , semi-automatic . Each mag ... Contains eight therapeutic rounds of dendrotoxin . In case you miss ! Or have multiple assailants . Yeah , w-we 're gonna have this new night-night pistol - working in no time . Okay ? - Great . One thing ... we 're not calling it that . - Ah , told you . - Yes , we ... yes , we are . - Have you seen Skye ? - Not since weapons training . Has she stopped saying " bang " when she pulls the trigger ? Mostly . Now , if she can just learn the difference between the safety release and the magazine release , we 'll be making real progress . - What 's up , Phil ? - I 'd prefer you not call me " Phil . " Okay , you 're the boss ... A.C. Just missing my van a bit , taking a little me time . I want your help with something . Hit me with it . - You ever rob a bank ? - No . - An armored car ? - Nope . - How about a casino ? - Should I be offended ? Somebody 's stealing millions of dollars in diamonds . They 've found a way to crack the security systems . I want you to figure out their exploit . Hmm . Yesterday , 25 men , all military , were hired by one of the largest gem brokers in the world . They dressed the men in identical outfits , gave each one a randomly assigned briefcase , and sent them along 25 different routes here in Stockholm . No one knew which briefcase contained the diamonds , but they were still stolen . Tack . Why the Kabuki theater ? They were afraid because somebody 's targeting diamonds ... an armored car in Milan , a safe in Monte Carlo , and now this ... over $ 30 mil total . Each theft occurred despite heavy security . - They sound like inside jobs . - A lot of people share that opinion . You don 't . CCTV cameras catch any of the action ? Fitz-Simmons is checking . The system went dark for an hour . - They think it was hacked . - It was the same thieves each time ? Yes , but it was just one thief ... a woman . - And she did it all with her eyes closed . - Eyewitnesses I.D. her ? Black , athletic build , late 20s , early 30s . So , you asked how she could have cracked the system . I have a pitch , but it 's way outside the box . I live outside the box . There are people in the world with superpowers , right ? What if this woman has ESP or something ? There are no credible studies that support precognition , - telepathy , or extrasensory perception . - Okay , so science says " no " . But this woman knew impossible things . And why did she close her eyes ? That 's either random or totally important . Was she listening ... or was she reading minds ? I 'm gonna go play with my phone now . Why does H.Q. want us to investigate these heists ? They don 't . I picked this op . - Any luck ? - Yep , I 'm getting full bars , which means if I was down here and 25 guys were in scary red masks , you know what I would do ? Instagram . It 's amazing . Every year , this part of our job gets easier . Between Facebook , Instagram , and Flickr , - people are surveilling themselves . - With many filters to choose from . I could do this pretty well when I was hacking for the Rising Tide , but you guys tag and search in ways the rest of us never dreamed of . I can run facial-recognition software on the photos , cross-reference them with our criminal databases . You don 't have to . That 's the thief . - Her name 's Akela Amador . - You 're certain ? I should be . I trained her . Akela Amador was a S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent . Seven years ago , she led a raid on one of Vanchat 's gulags . Everyone believed that she and the two other agents on the mission were killed . I had my doubts . So I sent in a second team , just in case . They found a lot of carnage but couldn 't confirm that any of it was Amador ... - left the possibility open . - That 's why you chose this op ... when you heard about the heists . There are only a few women in the world who could pull off something so impossible . Since you 're on the bus , I thought it had to be her . Swedish customs confirmed that Amador left the country using an alias on a Swedish passport . She flew into Belarus , bought a train ticket to a town called Zloda . I 've also put together a list of individuals who could fence that many diamonds . There 's been no contact or activity . Maybe she 's saving them for a rainy day , buying something special . Let 's focus on finding Amador . I 'll let H.Q. know she 's alive so they can assist with the manhunt . I 'd like to hold off on that . Until we know more . Contact Belarus authorities . Find us a place to park the bus . Put together a list of inns , hotels , and pensions near Zloda . There can 't be that many of them . We 'll find her . I 'm not so special after all . I 'm not your first protégée . Relax . I 'm teasing . I know I 'm not a protégée . Hell , I 'm not even a real , live S.H.I.E.L.D. agent yet . You two couldn 't be more different . Amador was smart , talented , fearless . - Wow , there 's nothing in common . - Let me finish . She didn 't play well with others , found little value in teamwork . I thought I could instill those qualities in her , so I pushed her ... maybe too hard . Don 't blame yourself because this chick went to the dark side . Whatever path she went down , whatever weird stuff she got into , it 's on her . The agreement was to come alone . - I did ! - What about the man in the next room ? Or the one by the stairs ? They 're here to protect me for when I leave ... with the merchandise ! Please . I 'm sorry . I 've never done this before . May I see them ? - The rest ... they are ... - In the bag . You can carry it through customs . No one will know . Now ... it 's your turn . When I said $ 30 million , I never thought anybody would ... If it fails , I will find you . It will access all the levels , as promised . But once you 're inside , do you have a plan ? It 'll come to me . How exciting . I 've dreamed of visiting Zloda since I was a schoolgirl . Zloda , Belarus ? A dream come true ? Really ? It 's the birthplace of Nobel physicist Zhores Alferov ! I mean , technically , he 's from Vitebsk , but that 's less than an hour from here , and I 'm a bit disappointed that you didn 't know that . Well , no , of course I know who that is , father of heterostructure transistors , thank you very much . We 're all well aware of that . I 'm just a little bit preoccupied . Our first and only other time in the field wasn 't exactly a picnic , was it ? You guys are only here to search for Amador electronically . You won 't even need to leave the van . - Bus to short bus . - Go for short bus . Next time , I 'll decide what we call ourselves , okay ? - H.Q. has requested a status update . - What 'd you tell them ? That we 're tracking a potential suspect ... nothing more . - I owe you one . - More like three . If Amador 's here , she 'll have to contact her buyer . Scan for cellphone transmissions , encrypted e-mails , anomalous broadcast signatures . Call us if you find anything that indicates her presence . Maintain radio silence unless you really need help . Well , what exactly defines needing help ? ! I can only imagine how painful this must be for you , sir ... betrayed by someone you trained and believed in . - We don 't have all the facts yet . - True , but I have to assume the worst ... that Amador sold out the other two agents on her mission . Wonder what she got in exchange . I don 't know , but until we do , I 'm not gonna assume anything . There 's barely electricity in this town . Can 't be too hard to find our mystery woman . Unless she already knows we 're here . No , you 're not suggesting some sort of precognition - or telepathy because ... - I know ... it doesn 't exist . And not long ago , I would have dumped ESP in the " aliens and portals are for crazy people " pile . But now ... Found a server . - Spacibo . - Da . - Did you locate Amador ? - What ? No , not yet . But we 've found a broadcast with some weird signal encrypted into it . You think Amador might be communicating on that signal ? Maybe , but I called with an equally pressing question for you , my S.O. what are we supposed to do if we have to pee ? You broke protocol because you need a bathroom break ? It was a really , really long drive , and everyone 's nervous . There 's a container in the bottom of the blue chest . Bottom of the blue chest . - Not the water bottle ? - That 's the one . Did you never learn the thing that boy parts and girl parts are different , and our parts aren 't penises ? Agent Coulson and I are trying to find a dangerous criminal . If there 's nothing else pressing ... Well , listen , Fitz wants to know if you packed any snacks . 'Cause I 'm feeling a bit peckish . Uh ... hello ? He ... he hung up . - Dobry den . - Good afternoon . I 'm Agent Coulson . This is Agent Ward . We 're looking for this young woman . Oh , she 's my angel . - Why do you say that ? - She has gift ... knows things . She told me to go to Doctor . He found a tumor . I 'm having surgery next week . This girl saved me . I can 't stabilize it . There 's an encrypted local signal competing . Mirror it over . I have a couple of rising tide exploits that might work . One last thing . Ta-da , and you 're welcome . It 's very important that we talk with her . With her gift , I 'm sure she knows you 're coming . What kind of TV show is this ? That looks a bit like our van . What are we looking at ? Us . Let 's get out of here ! Oh , stupid tall person . Call Coulson . Get the gun . It 's her . Safety off . Bang ? Sir , Amador attacked you and your people . Whatever regard you hold for her isn 't reciprocated . - She just kicked us in the teeth . - How 's the team ? Rattled . No broken bones . We 're lucky she just knocked the van over so she could get away . Probably take awhile for our folks to refocus . I think I can recover the data signature of that encrypted broadcast . I don 't understand it yet , but that 's how she was watching us . Give me an hour . Maybe we can start watching back . Something 's wrong . It 's the same feed that was watching us in the van . Uh , put it on the big monitor . M-maybe the lens broke when the van rammed us . I hope she broke more than that . It 's a mirror . Are we recording this ? Uh ... We are now . Whoa . How are we seeing this ? Where 's the camera ? It 's her eye . She 's the camera . It switches to backscatter when she closes her eyes . - You 're a robot . Can you do that ? - Who has tech like this ? We don 't ... not like this . That 's not small and internal . That 's at least a decade ahead of anything I 've seen . Though , now that I 've seen it , I could maybe approximate it ... the backscatter x-ray , a micro-transceiver that somehow doesn 't fry her brain , - an internal power source ... - All miniaturized . Honestly , it 's ... - That 's genius . - ... Genius . We have to bring her in . We have to take her out . She 's a weapon . I 'll call H.Q. , see if we can bring a task force in to help us . Our team can handle this . I get it . You feel responsible ... maybe you pushed her too hard . But she tried to kill three members of our team . If she wanted us dead , we 'd be dead . We got lucky . You want to risk our lives again ? You told me you were ready for combat , that you had my back . Don 't ever doubt it . But you are defending this girl at the expense of the team . Because we protect our own . With all due respect , sir , she 's not one of our own . Guys . Why does she have to ask for permission ? - Can I sleep ? - Stand by ... She 's not being watched . She 's being controlled . We have to find her . We 'll take shifts watching the feed . Sooner or later , she 'll look at something that will clue us into her location . I 'll take the first watch . I just wanted to give you a quick update . She 's still at the hotel , so ... and that 's the update . It 's a pretty weird day , huh ? It 's like we were trapped in a van-shaped pinata . That should never have happened . It 's okay . It wasn 't nearly as terrible as watching mom and dad fight downstairs . That shouldn 't have happened , either . You regret coming along ? It was pretty impulsive , even for me . I still don 't know much about you ... Except for you value really old stuff . And you value me . First person to do that in a long time . So I happen to believe you 're an excellent judge of character . If you think this woman deserves a second chance , we should give it to her even though she tried to kill me and I kind of hate her guts . - Fitz . - What ? - What happened ? Where 's May ? - Uh , I don 't know . She was watching the transmission . Amador must be sleeping . Play it back . There . She got another message ... Todorov building . Wait . Stop . Can you get closer on that receipt ? Damn it , May . Wake the others . Whoever 's monitoring you , do they have audio ? No . But they 'll use facial recognition to determine you 're a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent . So I don 't have to introduce myself . - Did Coulson send you ? - No . He feels sorry for you . I don 't . I 'm bringing you into S.H.I.E.L.D. , you 'll get a fair trial , and no one else gets hurt . You have no idea , do you ? We know that you receive orders . Then you know that once they see you , only one of us gets to walk out of here . They built in a fail-safe . Either I kill you ... or they kill me . You should have stayed in bed . Hello , Akela . You 're safe now . Give it a minute . I hit you with a powerful dendrotoxin . There 's a kill switch in my eye . Why hasn 't my handler blown it yet ? As far as your handler knows , you fought Agent May , you both went down , then you got up and left the building to complete your mission . - How ? - We hijacked your feed . One of my Agents is wearing a set of glasses mimicking your implant . Right now , it 's transmitting his point of view as if it was yours . It even has backscatter imaging . - I get messages from my handler . - We 're receiving those , as well . My agent 's on his way to the Todorov building ... completing your mission while we disable the fail-safe in your eye . I promise . They can 't see you . You 're okay , Akela . Look at me . How long have they been monitoring you ? Years . Why are you doing this , Coulson ? I need to know why a prox card is worth $ 30 million ... No . Why are you doing this ? Why are you helping me ? Where 's the " I told you so " ? That 's not me anymore . I 'm just glad you 're alive . Vanchat would have never caught us if I 'd just done my job . I should have listened to you ... trusted my team the way you insisted . If I had ... they might still be alive . - Where are we ? - Todorov building . - I think it 's research , not military . - Looks like a prison . We wireless yet ? Yep . Ready to detach . Don 't look at me . They need to think you 're her . And , oh , my god , super spy is ticklish . How did you manage to escape ? I didn 't . Got caught in a crossfire , went down . Woke up in some half-assed triage bay , blind in this eye . Spent the next four years alone in a cage - at the bottom of a copper mine . - We looked for you . Heard rumors you 'd been taken to ShanXi province . When a team finally came , I thought it was S.H.I.E.L.D. at first , but ... Who were they ? Don 't know , even to this day , but they were organized . They took me to a clinic . I had multiple surgeries . Until one day , I could see out of both eyes again . I was so grateful ... until I realized what they 'd done . - Somebody was watching . - My every move . I had no idea until they sent the first message . Then the assignments started . Mostly , it was " steal this , " " follow him , " " break into there . " I just tried to ignore them . But when I did , I 'd get this pain , - like an electric migraine . - The fail-safe . Polite way of putting it . Now , when I think about my years in the cage ... I miss it . I wish I could go back , be alone , sleep in peace . I know you 're tired , but I need your help . If you want information on the prox card , you 're out of luck . You can 't go on missions without intel . It comes in pieces ... a name , an address . It would suck to live like this , wondering if someone 's watching . Testing backscatter . Good to go . Remember , I can 't look at you , much less help you . Got it . Don 't count on you for help . I 'll be watching . Come on , Akela . You 've never spoken to or met anyone in person ? No . Only contacts are the messages I receive from the Englishman . The Englishman ... your handler ? How do you know he 's English ? The way he refers to certain things . He uses " lift " instead of " elevator , " - " boot " instead of " trunk . " - Think about the messages . What else do you know about him ? He 's late 30s , early 40s . Uses dated references ... " Disk drive " instead of " flash drive , " " Burma " instead of " Myanmar . " How 's his typing ? Clumsy . Makes a lot of mistakes . Thick fingers , maybe heavyset . I forgot how good you are . Sir , we 're ready down here . Fitz and Simmons are prepped for surgery . It should be any minute now . Hey ! Remember , you have man hands , so don 't look when you scan the card . I know . Ward 's on-site , so we don 't have much time . To remove her eyeball . Yeah , ocular surgery is not really my field of expertise . We 've got no other choice . There 's a kill switch inside Akela . Could be a poison , could be an explosive . Either way , if Ward 's caught , they 'll kill her instantly . Where are you going , sir ? To find out whose finger 's on the trigger . Approaching Delta 3 . Careful ! Mirror . - Don 't need your help . - Handler 's definitely local . Any idea where he 's transmitting from ? Somewhere here . Every time he sends a message , we get closer . Keep me updated on comm 3 . I 'm headed out now . I 'll track him down if you want to stay here and oversee the op . Thank you . This one 's mine . - And about earlier ... - Go . Find the guy . I may need your feedback during the operation , which means I have to inject a local anesthetic into your eye rather than putting you under . Whatever 's necessary . Right . Let 's begin , then . Let me . What do they mean , " target " ? It 's never good , especially for the target . Let 's hope it 's a knockout and not a kill . - You should get out of there . - I 've come this far . I 'll finish , whatever it takes . Help ... I 'm sorry . Did you say , " help " ? Because a minute ago , you said you didn 't want or need my help . That was before they asked me to go all Mata Hari on this guy . - I 'm just gonna knock him out . - Ward , wait . We may need them to get through the next door . Remember , it said seduce , not kill . I don 't think I 'm his type . Let me see . Cheap haircut . 5 : 00 shadow . Nope . Odds are you guys play for the same team . You 're gonna have to bromance him . Talk sports , Vodka , the Victorianov secret catalog . Be friendly , Agent Ward . Can you be friendly ? Please don 't die . Why are you here ? Hello . How are you ? Da ? Da ? Guess not . What now ? Are you supposed to grab one of these guys ? They just sent another message . Coulson , he 's close ... only a few blocks from you . He 's somewhere in Victory Square . One more message should lock in his precise location . Figured out what I needed the guard for ... his password . Maybe I can talk you through a hack . Just give me a minute . No more minutes . Meet me on the south side of the building , A.S.A.P. Gotcha . Which way is South ? Stoy ! - Please tell me it 's out already . - It 's mostly out . - What 's wrong ? - Nothing . But Dr. Fitzy needs to step in now . This is his area of expertise , not mine . Fitz . All right , then . Most likely , both the power source and kill switch are located within the eye itself . So , how to disconnect without triggering the kill switch ? Oh . I know what to do . Um ... I just need to clarify one thing . - Ward . - What ? You sound winded . - Is this a bad time ? - Little bit . Well , not so good for me , either , considering I 'm holding a still-attached prosthetic eye that could explode at any second . Are the wires exposed or shielded ? Cut it now . Cut the wires now ! What 's happening ? Oh , no problem . Ward explained the sitch . - Coming your way . - I don 't know what that means . Let 's go . He probably left as soon as he threw the kill switch . He 's there , 20 meters from you . I think I 've got him . - Excuse me , sir . - I 'm sorry , but I 'm very late . - I 'm with S.H.I.E.L.D. - Oh , god . He was a former M.I.6 officer who fell off the grid a few years ago . My handler was as trapped as I was . Which means the real threat 's still out there . Big S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s still trying to decipher what was written on that chalkboard . Nobody 's ever seen anything like it . Couple of people think it might be alien ... possibly an equation . Must be important if it 's worth $ 30 million . We 'll figure it out . You 'll get a fair trial . I plan on testifying . I know people . - You deserve a second chance . - You already gave me one . Doesn 't matter how it plays out from here . I 'm free . Thank you . Good luck . What happened to Agent Coulson ? He 's different . Well , he 's loosened up a bit . He nearly died before the battle of New York . - But what did they do to him ? - I 'm sorry ? Never mind . Are you still needing your you time ? There 's always room for A.C. Slide on in . What 's wrong with ... " Agent Coulson " or just " Coulson " ? Nothing , I guess . A.C. ' s just way cooler . 'Cause you are ... cool . Not many people would have made that call - to give Amador a second chance . - I got one . Seems only fair I extend the same opportunity to others . I see why you like it in here . Yeah . It 's kind of like my van . Without all the bums trying to break in . I don 't miss that . It 's more peaceful here . It 's also cool knowing that someone has my back ... no matter what . Peaceful 's good . We 'll be back in a moment ... I call . - And raise 100 . - Hmm . You know how I know I 'm gonna beat you ? By losing ? You have a tell , a psychological tic that lets me know you 're bluffing . If I watch you carefully ... If I watch you carefully ... Oh , sorry . Hang on . You know if I do this , that not only will I see Ward 's cards , but I 'll see you without any clothes on ? I fold . You win . Hmm .

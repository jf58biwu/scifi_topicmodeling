The ones we 're looking for are about twice this size . Won 't wrap around your arm . wrap around your whole body . Okay , listen up . The locations you 've been authorized to hunt these snakes are the Francis S. Taylor Wildlife Area , and the Southern Glades Wildlife Area . And I want you to stay in groups of two . Any questions ? How many of them pythons are out there ? Well , we really don 't know . We 're hoping that we get a handle on that before they can multiply . But pythons can lay up to 100 eggs per clutch , so there might be a lot of ' em . Ranger , please , you have got to stop this . I mean , these are living creatures . They can adapt and survive . You know what , Ma 'am ? Please don 't touch me . Ooh , somebody had bitch for breakfast . The pythons are decimating the ' gator population . The Osceola Turkey , the woodrat , they could even take out some of the 200 panthers in the area . Nature can balance itself without our interference . Let them live . The pythons are at the top of the food chain . That 's just the way it is . That 's how it 's supposed to be . No , that 's not how it is . The pythons aren 't at the top of the food chain .

I talked to Justin 's father . We should get the body over to Friends Funeral Home , in Flagstaff . Yeah . Not a problem . Sweetie , you gotta go home and get some rest . Those snakes destroyed my home ! I know . They ruined everything ! They took Justin from me ! I know. look , I 've got this friend , Sylvie from the church , and she has a friend in the Appalachian Indian Tribe . He swears that he can help us kill the snakes . I don 't want some witch doctor . No , no , no , no . He 's a herpetologist . Dr. Diego Ortiz . He 's written books and been on Oprah , he can help us . Fine , but I 'm not waiting for him . I 'm gonna take care of these things tonight . How ? How are you gonna take care of it ? We need a bigger ' gator ! Okay , give me your keys , 'Cause you 're in no shape to drive . You want a bigger ' gator ? I 'll get you one . [ LOW GRUNTING ] I just know that park ranger 's gonna try something else . I just know it . Okay , we really have to keep our eye on her , 24 / 7 , 365 . Yeah , but , Nikki , they already kicked us out . I mean , what else can we do ? That 's what we 're gonna do ! Cameras in the Glades . We can watch every single thing she does . If she hurts my snakes , we 'll get it on film . What happens if we run into the snakes ? Don 't get eaten . Hey , Honey . Hey , Gram , how 's it going ? Mwah . Good to see you . Hey , Terry ! Enough small talk . Where 's the stuff ? Go get it . Look , I don 't know what you guys want with this , alright ? And I don 't really want to ask . I 'm afraid . Well , then it works out just fine , because I 'm not gonna tell you anything , anyhow . But you realize that some of this stuff has bad side effects like aggression , acne . You have enough here for a whole army . Manny , just give her the anabolic steroids , otherwise I 'm gonna have to arrest you for illegal possession . Manny , go put it in the truck . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . What 's that box ? I don 't think I should give you that box yet . Why ? It 's something the university is experimenting with , and it 's only taken in small amounts . I don 't think you should use it . Well , what is it exactly ? It 's experimental , okay ? But the guys on the team won 't even take it . What it does is , it blocks the proteins that limit muscle growth . They 're called myostatins . So by taking that , your muscles grow indefinitely ? Yeah . Oh ! Don 't worry , Manny . We 'll be very careful with this . Go ahead , Hon. Okay . Now all we have to do is find some dead chickens . I don 't know , Terry . Maybe this isn 't such a great idea . Even to me it 's beginning to feel a little nuts . What choice do we have ? Those monsters are out there . They 're ruining everything ! It 's like they wanted to come and get me ; to take away my happiness ... to take away anything that ever meant anything to me . Don 't you see ? - Yeah , I know . Tell me that you see that . Hey , you know , be careful with those . 'Cause that 's the special stuff that Manny told us about . Right . Screw it . That 's a whole lot of dead chicken . Well ? The cameras are working fine . [ LOW GRUNTING ] Are you sure about this ? creating bigger , stronger ' gators to eat the snakes ? The balance of nature Must be preserved , okay ? So give him another dead chicken . I mean , what 's crazy about this ? We 're just feeding steroids to ' gators . There 's nothing crazy about this . What could go wrong ? What the hell are they doing ? Looks like they 're feeding the ' gators chicken . Why would she be doing that ? Gia , make sure you 're recording this . You got it . Let 's go home . Come on , Terry . Let 's go home , huh ? It 's okay . Okay , come on . I 'll take care of you . Let 's go . Come on . What the hell are you doing to my ' gators ? Sir , this is Federal property . Permits are not being issued . I 'm not a hunter . Who are you ? I 'm Dr. Ortiz . You can call me Diego . It 's remarkable , I must say , the increased aggression in these animals . You can see the stress in the plants . It 's a good thing you called me to help you figure this out . Oh , yeah . You know , thank you very much , but I 've taken care of it . Actually , no , you haven 't . What the hell is that ?

Hello , and thank you all for coming . A year ago , my fiance and I thought of this event to raise awareness for the Everglades , and its intense need for conservation outreach . The Everglades are home to 36 threatened or endangered species , All of which are greatly affected by changes in water flow . That is why restoring this estuary is so important . When I look out and I see this beautiful lush area , I think of my late fiance , Justin Regina . and now , Ladies and Gentlemen , keep drinking ! [ APPLAUSE ] Mickey Dolenz is looking good , right ? Yeah , he 's hot . What the hell are you doing in my VIP tent ? I want you out of here now ! Oh , it 's your VIP tent , is it ? In your Everglades . Hmm ? You treat this as if it were your own private little domain , like you own it or something , But it 's not really your property now , is it ? Oh , it absolutely is . And to prove it to you , I 'm gonna have you thrown out by my deputy . Oh , I 'm not going anywhere . No , not until everybody sees this . What is that ? That is footage of you planting steroids in those chickens and feeding them to those ' gators . That proves nothing . Oh , bitch , please ! You 're going down . Give it to me ! It wasn 't enough that you had to kill your own fiance , huh ? You had to kill other innocents as well . You are gonna get it , you ' gator-baiting bitch . Only in your dreams . Give it to me ! Crazy snake-loving maniac ! [ PARTY GUESTS GASP ] You insane ' gator-doping lunatic . Give it to me ! Get off of me ! You did not just do that . What ?

Oh , my God. you 'll never believe what we saw out there . Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . We gotta get out of here now . But how ? There 's my truck . That 's where we 're going . Okay . Let 's go . What the hell do we do now ? I don 't know , but I 'm freezing . What do you think , Terry ? You wanna try to get the National Guard out here Before the creatures leave the Everglades ? They 're extremely territorial . We have to come up with a way to stop them , before they get to Miami . Before it 's too late . I think it already is too late . [ SIREN ] They got the mall . I 've always hated that mall . Well , maybe we can ... How much of that pheromone can you get your hands on ? Oh , so now I have good ideas , huh ? How much ? I have a lot of it back in my office . I confiscated a lot of it . Confiscated ? Even if we can lure them out to the quarry , We 'd have to get back in there to set off the dynamite . Got to get all those eggs , too . If those eggs hatch , forget it . No don 't move . Maybe it won 't see us . 'Gators can 't see straight ahead . It might not even know we 're here . If i can just back it up in a straight line ... Damn it ! Damn it ! Get away ! Get out ! His mouth ! Aah ! I 'm trying ! Oh , my God ! DIEGO : Put it through his mouth . I 'm trying for it . We gotta get you closer . One more ! One more ! Shoot him right down the mouth . TERRY : Careful ! DIEGO : Aim for the mouth ! Bastard ! TERRY : Watch out ! The snake ! Damn ! Hey ! My rifle ! Get my rifle ! [ TERRY AND NIKKI SCREAMING ] So what are we gonna do ? There has to be something that we can do . Diego , you 're a pilot , right ? Yeah . So ? So have you ever flown a crop duster ? What are you thinking ? Well , if we could just get the pheromones from my office- - We could spray ' em down the highway ... and lure ' em into the Everglades . But we 'd have to set up the explosives beforehand in the quarry . It could work . Nikki , take the stick while I load my gun . I hate small planes . I really hate small planes . Would you shut up and stop being such a wimp . Let 's get this straight . We 're going to drop you at the quarry , Nikki . While you 're setting up the explosives , We 're going to go pick up the pheromones and start dusting the highway . We 're going to lead those animals right to you . Exactly why do I need to be the one to stay in this rattletrap and work the hopper ? Well , if you 're scared , I can do it , But that would mean that you have to go to the quarry and set the dynamite . Unless , of course , you don 't know how to set explosives . In fact , I don 't . Forgive me , but I 'm not a terrorist , like some people . Environmentalist . - Excuse me . Which , sometimes requires extreme measures--okay ? Diego , can you land this thing ? My office is across the river . Okay , meet you back here When I 'm done . Yeah . Nikki ? Good luck . [ CRACKLING ] [ BABY ' GATORS GROWL IN THEIR SHELLS ] [ TO HERSELF ] Okay ... Pretend they 're not here , okay . Oh , God . Oh , don 't hatch yet ! All right . It 'll all be okay . It 's okay . Oh , just relax . All right , this is the last of it . Okay . We 're good to go ? Yeah . Let 's do it . Okay , okay . I think we 're far enough out . Wanna give it a shot ? Yeah , let 's do it . All right. on 3 , I 'm gonna pop the hopper . Okay . 1 , 2 , 3 . Did it open ? No , it 's not working . Oh , hell ! Wait . Be careful . Maybe I can rig it . Okay , it 's working . It 's spraying . Good job . Get a little lower , though . Roger that . That was a good save , kid . I don 't see any animals coming , do you ? Nothing moving . Get even lower . Here goes . Wait . They 're coming ! Yeah ? A lot of ' em ? All right ! Yeah , a lot of ' em . It 's amazing.I can see all of them . Oh , I hope Nikki 's getting that dynamite ready . [ BABY ' GATORS GROWLING IN THEIR SHELLS ] What 's that ? Is that the Turkey Point nuclear facility ? Yeah , yeah . We gotta steer clear of that . We gotta stay as far away from that as we possibly can . Aah ! Aah ! [ ALARM BUZZES ] Hang on ! Hold on ! Come on , come on . Come on . Come on for me , Baby ! Come--aah ! Shoot ! Darn it ! All right , concentrate . Concentrate . [ GROWLING ] Get back . Okay . All right . Oh , God . No . Back . Okay ... Diego , are you okay ? Terry ... Diego , are you okay ? I 'm good . You ? [ AIRCRAFT CREAKING ] We gotta go . We gotta get out of here . They 're coming ! They 're coming ! Come on ! No , you can make it . Come on ! My foot 's under- - No , my foot . My foot . I 'm gonna pull you out . Come on . Okay . Okay . No , no , no . Listen , it ain 't working . What can I do ? What can I do ? What should I do ? You gotta get out of here . You gotta lead the animals away from the reactor . You gotta grab the pheromone . Grab the pheromone and keep ' em away from here . Go ! Go now . Come on , go , go . [ CREAKING ] I found a car . Good . Now go . Hurry . I just can 't leave you here . You have to — you have to keep those things away from here . Go now ! - Diego , I 'm sorry . [ SIRENS ] Aah ! Aah ! [ FIRES RIFLE ] Keep coming . PILOT : We have a visual on a survivor . Should we pick him up ? DISPATCH : Affirmative . Proceed with caution . Little ' gators , don 't call your mommies ! Get back . Okay . Don 't call---Aaaaah ! Oh , God . Don 't- - Stay back ! [ ROARING ] Shoot ! Terry ? Nikki , Where are you ? Terry , I 'm down here in the cave , but I can 't get out . Okay , hold on . I 'm coming to get you . [ ROAR ] Aah ! Aah ! Okay , whatever you 're doing is really pissing her off . Aah ! Ohh ... Terry , you saved my life . We 're stuck in this together . Where 's Diego ? Is he okay ? No . No , the plane went down . Look , distress calls can be heard up from four miles from baby ' gators . With ' gators this big , God only knows ... it could be 100 miles or so . Pythons , too . The plan 's gonna work , they 'll be coming for a meal . They 're coming . Oh , my God . What are we gonna do ? The snakes are here . The yelps from the baby ' gators are luring them to the quarry . We have to go back . Come on . Come on ! Damn it ! I know , what a mess ! If we don 't get out of here , we 're gonna ... We 're gonna have to throw the switch . It 's all my fault . No , it 's my fault . Wait , what do you mean ? What do you mean , what do I mean ? I did it . I released those snakes into the Everglades . Bitch . Shh . Shh ! Do you hear that ? It 's a helicopter . Come on . Let 's go . Okay , we 're coming . We 're coming down . DIEGO : Come on ! Come on . I ... got you . Terry ! Oh , my God ! They 're gonna get her . Terry ! You can do it ! - Help me ! You gotta pull her up ! Help me ! Please ! COME ON ! PULL HER UP ! NIKKI : Come on ! Hold on ! Come on ! Is it wired to blow ? Yes . Yes . You got the detonator ? - Yes . Nikki ! Aaaah ! Turn this thing around ! She 's alive ! I 'm alive ! Unbelievable . I 'm alive ! I 'm alive ! Oh , my God . Go down . Go down . Get it down ! Aaaaaah ! And so here we are , a year later , To celebrate this beautifully restored estuary , A project so important to the future of the Everglades . This estuary will preserve the Everglades for centuries to come , and it is fitting that we dedicate it in the names of those heroic women who gave their lives to save this park ... [ APPLAUSE ] To save this city , a city that each of them , in her way , loved so much . [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] So everyone , I ... I now dedicate the O 'Hara-Riley Estuary . Woman : ¶ ... BETTER STICK TO THE ROAD ¶ ¶ THERE 'S A WILD WIND A-CHURNING ... ¶

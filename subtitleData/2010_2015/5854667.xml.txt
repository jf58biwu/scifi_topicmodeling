 This device turns any moisture around it to ice Very rapidly , at a great range . A bigger version of the ice machine ? This is very , very dangerous . May : What will happen to him ? Coulson : They 're moving him to the sandbox . They want to keep an eye on him . Both : Ward ! Your attempt to cross off fitz and simmons failed , Coulson : Since simmons left , he 's only getting worse , Talking to himself more and more . I 'm being overly discreet with this operation . I know how long you have been searching for this , Dr. Whitehall . You have no idea . [ ticking ] First time I drank this , I had just enlisted . It was bland , immature . But [ sighs ] I had a hunch . I bought a case . [ sniffs ] mm . Mmm . [ smacks lips ] $ 10 seemed so expensive back then . And now one bottle costs over $ 2,000 . Goes to show you patience is most definitely a virtue - - Something we 've both benefited from . [ ticking continues ] I believe in second chances . I want us to work together . I want you to become a valued member Of our organization . Surrender ... And you will find meaning . Surrender ... And you will find release . Take a deep breath . Calm your mind . You know what 's best . What 's best is you comply . Compliance will be rewarded . Are you ready to comply , agent 33 ? I will never work for hydra . I expected it would be a long night . Why I decided to treat myself . [ ticking continues ] mm . Mr. Bakshi , let 's go again . Where do we start ? At the beginning . Like the song says , a very good place to start . You and I both know the faustus method takes time . And I 've got plenty .

[ gunshots ] [ shells clatter ] [ exhales deeply ] I imagined they were all ward . Imagine they 're all targets . Don 't get cocky . This is step one . ... Over your mind , your body . Don 't forget your mind . In the field , you need to maintain control . Whatever the situation - - Hostages , bombs about to go off - - So , what you 're saying is What I just did was puny and sad . [ beep ] 61 beats per minute . Consistent the whole time . Not that puny . [ chuckles ] Skye : Speaking of not puny ... Yeah , I want you to get used to this . It 's a sniper rifle . Huh . Pardon me . Uh , just one quick question . You went to s.H.I.E.L.D. Academy , right ? If you did , you would have known better Apology number 470 - - I am very sorry , agent may . Don 't be sorry . Just wait . Uh , we just have a little wager . Uh , so , did you ... ? Go to the academy ? Yeah , no . All right , well , have fun with the inventory . And remember , koenig likes them neat . Oh , and , uh , none of those euro sevens With the lines through them . Drives him crazy . Coulson said you were a field agent With a badge and all . More like a work-study thing . Badge , I had for like a day before s.H.I.E.L.D ... You know , hartley - - she loved her blade , hated guns . Idaho - - if on a job someone ended up dead , He 'd go to church , light a candle . Said it 'd balance the karma . See , I knew them , what they 'd do , not do . So , us being workmates and all ... You 're wondering if I 've ever taken anyone out . Have you ? Not that I know of . Hey . Don 't you have inventory ? I suppose now I do . Good afternoon , ladies . Practice . I want you to get used to the recoil . [ door closes ] And for the record , Experience doesn 't make it any easier to cross someone off . [ sighs ] You 're alone . Should I assume ? That the entire trip was a waste of precious jet fuel ? Yep . Assume that . At least tell me that agent 33 retired . Nope . They got to her first . It 's gone from being a land grab to a talent grab . And I 'm getting damn tired Of losing our best and brightest to hydra . Ms. Simmons , I need everything you have I 'm not done . I 'm testing a second set of dn- - right . Just whatever you have . What I have is more questions than answers . Okay , know what ? I get it . You don 't have time . Neither do I. And I have been called upstairs to fill them in . No prep time , no powerpoint , Just me , pants around my ankles , talking out of my butt . If you want , I could accompany you , Oh , no , y-you don 't want to go up there . The higher you go ... The scarier it is . Okay . Well , what you can say is That the cells have an abnormal ability to create Trace amounts of liquid nitrogen . [ pen clicking ] what about the dna markers ? The anomaly appears to be environmental , not genetic . Is that - - It 's just another acquisition . [ moroccan dance music plays ] [ music continues ] I thought that was broken for good . You clearly have a gift . A degree . I used to study engineering . You know , I could help out around here . Fix things in exchange for room and board . It 's been a while since I 've liked being somewhere . Marrakech has a long history of giving shelter To travelers hiding from their past . [ music fades ] Why would you think I 'm hiding ? Who were you speaking to ? They said you were dangerous and - - Man : Mr. Gill . We don 't want to hurt you . Stand down , agent . Holster your weapon . Mr. Gill ... We just want to talk . If you would just hear me out . No . I can 't . " maribel del mar . " [ thud ] Did you think I wouldn 't find out ? Sriracha ? Beer ? That 's all ? What kind of diet is that ? Well , I also have tea . And if my diet 's such a concern , Then perhaps dead drops shouldn 't involve fast food . We 'll revisit that protocol . I picked up some groceries . We 've got ... Steak - - grass-fed - - Fingerling potatoes , Kale - - organic . It 's basic , but I do good basic . While I cook , you debrief . [ sighs ] Do you remember donnie gill ? From the academy ? I mean , I knew he was a gifted scientist , But you 're saying he 's ... A gifted scientist . Gill was struck by lightning While holding the device that created the storm . Perhaps the electrical surge Infused his system with a freezing agent ? It 's just - - well , it 's just speculation . They 're keeping me sequestered in the downstairs lab . I usually advance much more quickly , But they are intent on wasting my talents Doing rudimentary biochem And molecular analysis on blind samples . It 's not about your intellect . Have you made friends ? Oh , sir , you don 't need to worry . I mean , it 's been a tad lonely , true , but ... You weren 't asking Out of concern of my feelings , were you ? Undercover is all about the relationships you make . If you 're gonna move up in hydra , You need to make friends . Be like ward ? I can 't lie like he did . You don 't need to . Selective truths . You 're very likable . Use that . [ sighs ] So , how is everyone ? Fitz is okay . He 's hanging in there . You think they 're trying to recruit donnie gill As a scientist ? That would be the best-case scenario . Most likely scenario - - hydra 's looking for another weapon . From what we 've been able to piece together , Donnie gill had limited powers While there , he was taught to control , Lovely . And who , exactly , do we have to thank for that ? S.H.I.E.L.D. Or hydra ? Your guess is as good as ours . Hydra had scientists embedded at the base . Explains how they took it so quickly . A friend of mine was stationed there . He said it got bad fast . Is that when gill escaped ? What I do know is creel wasn 't an isolated incident . I 've been told gill 's next on hydra 's wish list . Told by who ? I have a source . A source you trust ? Very much so . Now , I want us to bring gill in Before hydra gets their hands on him . Fitz , you know him better than any of us . Got anything to help us narrow the search ? Um ... Well ... The la- - the last time that I saw him , He was , um ... Angry ? On drugs ? Uh ... Friendly ? Sleeping ? Yeah . Sleeping ? No . What - - the one - - the - - go back one . Friendly ? Friendly . Um ... Uh ... No , he had trouble making friends . [ sighs ] anything else ? I don 't know . Maybe ask jemma if you have a contact number for her . Okay . And if you think of anything - - Yeah , we 'll work on it . May , you lead the search to find gill . Let me know as soon as you have something . Scan satellite feeds for any temp- - Shouldn 't skye be here ? She 's working another angle . Well , they 're not exactly what you 'd call welcoming . They don 't give you a choice . So , what do they give you ? Money ? Threats ? Torture ? Combo platter ? They 're good at convincing people . Yeah , well , they suckered you in . No . I was never loyal to hydra . I was loyal to garrett . Oh . Garrett is the reason you 're a cold-blooded killer . I don 't blame him for the choices I 've made . Right . I seem to remember you blaming your brother . Or was it your parents ? Man , I can 't keep up . My family tore me down . Garrett built me back up ... The way he wanted . We 're all aware of who your family is , ward . Not only are they respected . They 're pretty much loved . Well , every family has its secrets . Yours does , too . You ever wonder why - - You know what ? [ clears throat ] My bad . I slipped . Talked to you like a normal person . Let 's stay on task . You make the rules . [ inhales deeply ] Hydra 's protocol on gifteds is pretty straightforward . An acquisition team is sent out To convince or capture the gifted . If those two options aren 't possible , Then they 'll take them out . Even if the gifted doesn 't pose a threat ? A gifted that refuses hydra is a threat . And threats are taken care of quickly . That 's the difference between s.H.I.E.L.D. And hydra . And that 's why hydra will win . Because while a s.H.I.E.L.D. Agent is Considering right and wrong , Hydra 's already taken the shot . [ man vocalizing ] Make friends . Mr. Turgeon , hello ! [ chuckles ] I was thinking of going over to salties . Happy hour and karaoke could be a load of - - Uh , ms . Simmons - - call me jemma . Jemma , you are wanted upstairs for questioning . Is this regarding my analysis - - It 's a security matter . Uh , yes . These men will escort you . What did you do ? Well , then I 'm sure you have nothing to worry about . Man : Floor number 25 . [ elevator bell dings ] Ms. Simmons . Have a seat . Leave us . Stay close ... In case there are consequences . You 've been lying to us , ms . Simmons . Not long ago , you were a level 5 s.H.I.E.L.D. Agent . I was candid about my work history . You left things out . If I did , it wasn 't intentional . Stop ... Lying . You 've been doing cellular analysis For project blizzard , yet didn 't inform your supervisor That you knew the subject . I didn 't realize it was gill until yesterday , When I saw a photo in kenneth 's file . I-I would have said something - - Yet you didn 't . What else ... Are you hiding ? I didn 't want to corrupt my analysis - - Analysis which I 'd done before I knew who it was . I-I barely knew him . You saved his life . Only because I happened to be at the academy Giving a le- - a lecture . You seem nervous . [ scoffs ] because I am . I was escorted here by armed guards . I 'm well aware of who I work for . Hmm . Let 's discuss your previous employer . Why did you join s.H.I.E.L.D. In the first place ? I was a 17-year-old girl With two phds and a million questions . S.H.I.E.L.D. Had the resources to help me answer them . Now they don 't , and hydra does . So your loyalties are with us ? My loyalties are with science . So long as hydra allows me To do the work I want to be doing , Then , yes , my loyalties are with hydra . Well , loyalties can be tested . Whitehall : Why cling To the founding principles of s.H.I.E.L.D. ? [ electricity crackles ] freedom . Equality . Individual rights . These principles make mankind a plague on this planet . It dries up and catches fire with the first spark . Now , mankind would fight that fire , Believing every individual plant perfect In its own individual way . But it 's the fire that 's perfect . [ metal clangs ] Essential . Now more magnificent plant species , Like the giant sequoia , Their seeds need the heat of that fire To crack open and be born . To literally rise from the ashes . And they will live for a thousand years . You don 't need to keep burning . [ breathes shakily ] Rise . Be born . Sir , I hate to interrupt , But I 'd like to evaluate one of our employees And act with authority . Mr. Bakshi , I trust you to do what needs to be done . Are you ready to comply ? [ grunts ] [ groans ] Maribel del mar . Anchored in the port of casablanca . It 's a privately owned cargo ship . Supposed to cast off this morning but didn 't . Iceberg in the middle east ? Gill 's not subtle . Trip , how long till you can have the bus in the air ? 15 , tops . You got 15 minutes to gather your gear . Excuse me , but gill wasn 't hard to track . If hydra are looking , they 'll find him . The asset said hydra would be ready to take him out If they couldn 't capture or recruit him . Which is why we have to beat them to it . I 'll coordinate from the bus . Down to 14 minutes . Let 's get moving . They 're taking the bus . You know what that means ? Koenig 's on assignment and won 't be hogging the xbox . [ scoffs ] Man , why aren 't you happier about this ? 'cause I should be going . I mean , I-I knew him . No need to feel bad about it . It is what it is . Skye 's asset . Now donnie . They 're - - they 're keeping things from me . Yeah , they 're keeping you from an icy death . That 's it . Don 't start getting paranoid on me . Where are you taking me ? Thank you . Thanks very much . [ guns cocking ] Ms. Simmons . Do you have anything warmer ? I 'll grab you something before we leave . Leave ? Where to ? We 've found donnie gill . We 've tried bringing him into the fold before . Now we have a second chance . With you - - a friendly , honest face . Maybe we 'll have better luck . He 's dangerous , isn 't he ? Don 't worry . We 'll have your back every step of the way . Suit up . It 's going to get cold . You have no idea what you are bringing down on yourself . We will find you . I know . I want to be left alone , But you people won 't stop coming after me ! So I 'm done hiding . It 's time hydra learned once and for all ... I 'm not interested . I 'm not afraid . I 'm pissed off . And every hydra agent they send is going to feel it . The asset skye 's been talking to - - It 's him . Oh , mack was right . You 're sounding paranoid . Stop assuming the worst . They 're keeping things from me , And I just want to know the truth . Fitz . You need to be honest with yourself . You 're barely holding it together . There 's a reason they 're keeping things from you . I don 't think you should go in there . You are not here . [ beep ] [ beep ] I imagine you 've got a lot to say to me . [ breathing shakily ] [ panting ] Look , despite all of this It 's really good to see you . Fitz ? Fitz , are you al- - Stop . Stop talking . Stop . [ breathing deeply ] I 'll be listening to everything . I 'll be in your ear , talking you through it . And what if he doesn 't respond well ? Then I suppose there 'll be a job opening at our laboratory . Your first jump ? Second . First was with coulson and lola . It 's a car . It flies . Yeah , this is my first . Maybe you should be . I packed your chute . And according to my ex , my folding skills are abysmal . Nice thing is this is as scary as it gets . [ beep ] once you jump , physics takes over . Yeah , I 'm good . Thanks . May : Trip says two minutes out . Remember , donnie gill 's a gifted . He could be a formidable weapon for either side . Let 's make sure it 's ours . [ beep ] [ breathing heavily ] Ward : I didn 't want to hurt you . I tried to avoid it . You tried to kill us . No . I wanted to save you . Garrett ordered me to kill you and simmons . He expected me to put a bullet in your head . But I couldn 't . I gave you a fighting chance to find a way out , Like you always do . Like you did . Save me ? Do - - do you - - do you - - do you know What the , um ... What you - - Okay . I - - you know , I have trouble with words , So , um ... [ sighs ] ... It 's probably best that I show you . [ beep ] show me what ? Hypoxia . Found that one . That 's what you did to me . [ beep ] [ sniffs ] Fitz ? What are you doing ? I 'm showing you ... What it 's like When you 're deprived ... [ gasps ] ... Of , uh ... [ gasping ] The oxygen - - b - the brain cells , They - - they re- - they react first . They die . Three minutes , damage is permanent . [ gasps ] where 's skye ? Gone . They 're all gone after donnie . And I should be there with them . But I can 't be because of you , Because of what you did to me ! I 'm damaged ! Donnie - - donnie - - donnie gill . That 's - - that 's why skye was - - No ! I 'm not - - I-I don 't - - I don 't , uh - - I don 't answer , uh - - fitz . Listen to me . Listen . You [ gasps ] they don 't know what they 're walking into . Simmons : Hello ? Donnie ? [ gasps ] oh . I 'm looking for - - I 'm looking for donnie gill . Hello ? You may not remember me . Agent simmons ? Donnie . It 's nice to see you again . Who - - who sent you ? S.H.I.E.L.D. ? H-hydra ? What - - what side did you end up on ? I 'd like to think I 'm on your side . Get close to him . Convince him you want to help . I saved your life once . I heard you were in trouble . Please , I ... I need you to hear me out . [ gunshots ] Coulson , we 're not alone . Not what I hoped , but not unexpected . Proceed . Let me know when you have eyes on gill . Copy that . Skye , you cover the door . You don 't give the orders , trainspotting . I 'm not scottish . Skye , protect the exit route . Roger that . [ gunfire ] Fitz : Mack ! Come on . Come on . Mack ! Aah ! Come on ! Mack ! Oh , my god . Hey . Hey , hey ! What the hell , man ? ! I just took out the boomers ! Uh , the bus ! The bus ! We need to talk to the bus ! Simmons : Fitz would talk about you . He described the blueprints he saw in your room . He was quite impressed . And fitz is very hard to impress . Get him to trust you . You 're a lot like him . Like both of us , really . We 're scientists - - wired to solve problems . Maybe before . It 's different now . Oh , I don 't believe you . You must miss it . Minds like ours - - they need to be used . I 'm tired of being used . Don 't let him get angry . Repeat what I say . Take a deep breath . Take a deep breath . And clear your mind . Surrender and you will find meaning . Surrender and you will find release . Agent simmons ... Take a deep breath . Donnie didn 't escape the sandbox . He took the sandbox for hydra . Hydra recruited gill ? Uh ... The ... The brain . The brain . And they 're gonna re-trigger his programming if they can . How do you know this ? I spoke to ward . We 'll talk about that when I get home . May , hunter , do either of you have eyes on gill ? Not yet . Hunter : Target is talking to hydra . End that conversation . Now . Copy that . You know what is best . What is best is you comply . You think I don 't know what you 're trying to do ? You 're just like the rest of them . You liar ! [ groans ] What am I hearing ? [ sighs ] Agent may shot me . Repeat ? May shot me . Man , I wanted to be the one . Repeat - - simmons is on site with hydra . Do we maintain her cover ? Yes . Maintain her cover . Your source ? My source . That 's crazy . What about the primary target ? If we can 't take him in , we take him out . Do you copy ? Copy that . Copy . Is he far behind ? Not far . I 'm sorry . I tried . It 's all right . Conditions are better here , anyway . Good afternoon , mr . Gill . You . Take a deep breath . No . Calm your mind . No . Please . Please . You know what is best . What is best is you comply . Don 't . Compliance will be rewarded . Mr. Gill ... Are you ready to comply ? I 'm happy to comply . Prove it , then . Keep us from being followed . Move out ! What just happened ? You laid the groundwork and gave us a second chance . He 's with us again . [ ice crackling ] Let 's head out . Ice everyone inside this ship . No one leaves here alive . May : Exit 's this way . [ grunts ] it 's frozen . Let me . We trapped . [ ice crackling ] [ metal groaning ] [ gunshot ] [ grunts ] [ bullet ricochets ] let 's go ! [ inhales deeply ] [ helicopter blades whirring ] The threat 's been neutralized . Hydra doesn 't have him . And agent simmons ? Her cover 's been maintained . She 's safe for now . They 're leaving empty-handed . But we 're not . Too bad we couldn 't make off with the whole cargo ship . Want to take a bet how much tech 's in the cargo ? Not gonna sucker me into doing your inventory , mack . Good try , though . Trip , have you seen skye ? Upstairs . [ grunts ] in case you 're wondering , I 'm all right . Nasty-looking bruise on my shoulder . Hurts like hell , but I deserved it . Mm-hmm . So , we 're even ? Right ? We are . [ sighs ] What are you doing in here ? I don 't know . It reminds me of before . [ sighs ] If we 're gonna take her out regularly . I 've been monitoring moroccan law-enforcement channels . They still haven 't found donnie gill 's body yet . You okay ? No . I get why coulson kept what simmons was doing from us . I understand he 's protecting her , Making sure no one compromises her mission , But you knew ? I knew . I 'm scared for her . Simmons in hydra ? She 's a terrible liar . I 'm serious . I love her , but her trying to lie - - it is a horror show . Maybe before , but not anymore . She can handle it . She 's good . She 's not the only one . [ door closes ] We should talk . First of all , I want you to know that I see your progress . You 're an important part of this team , And I don 't want you to forget that . But I saw the recording . Your conversation with ward . You almost killed him . But I didn 't . I 'm not a killer . I can 't look at him . I hate that he 's here . But we barely know anything about hydra . I need to do whatever it takes To understand the people we 're fighting . Ward is one way I 'm trying to do that . Well , you should have told me . Maybe . I didn 't want to add To what you were already dealing with . And is , um - - is there anything ... Is there anything more ? That I 'm keeping from you ? Yeah . I 'm director . There 's a hell of a lot more . But there is one other thing you should know . Simmons is on an assignment . That 's why she hasn 't been in contact . That 's why she left . Hmm . And , um ... Did she ask to go on the assignment ? Did she want to leave ? What she 's doing is very important . S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s becoming a problem . Do we know who 's in charge ? I 'm afraid not . [ elevator bell dings , door opens ] I 'm sorry to interrupt . I was told to bring these . Please , bring it here . Thank you . I appreciate it . Happy to comply . Donnie 's programming proved to be unstable . Ultimately , it held . One last thing . There 's a scientist in our downstairs lab . I believe her talents are being wasted . I 'd like authorization to bring her up here . So , you trust her ? I do now . But if I 'm wrong ... We 'll make her comply . We 'll return in a moment . Relieved it 's not fitz ? Happy it 's you , that you 're okay . I 'm , uh , glad I could help . You said hydra had a way of convincing people . You were talking about brainwashing , weren 't you ? It 's not done often , but it 's done . And some people aren 't susceptible . It 's mostly used on high-value targets . Like you ? I wish I could say that 's what happened . But I swore I 'd never lie to you . No . I was never brainwashed . Everything I did , good and bad ... I did of my own free will . Do you believe I 'm telling you the truth ? I just don 't know why . I don 't know what you hope to achieve by - - I don 't hope for me . I hope for you . I know something . And I want you to believe me when I say it . Your father is alive . He 's looking for you . And someday , if you let me , I 'll take you to him . We 're done here . [ breathing heavily ] [ beep ] [ breathes deeply ] [ beep ]

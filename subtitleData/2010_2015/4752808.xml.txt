Huh ? Oh . Uh ... Yes sir . Straight through . I swear , every year it 's the same damn cutscene . Some media darling with a five-second kill reel breezes into school on a golden ticket . Buckle up , kid . Cuz this ticket puts you on a plane straight to hell . And the in-flight movie ? Super hell . Understood , sir . I know it will be rough here , but ... I did get some practice at the Milwaukee Invitational , so ... Oh , really ? Still feeling cocky , Mr. Milwaukee ? You 're the lowest-ranked player in the school ! Well I should probably go get some practice then ... And as for you , Ki Swan . I don 't care what game your parents developed . What the frag are you doing ?

Hey , check out the cool kid with the cool hat ! Hey , sweet hat , frosh ! The name 's Games ... Games Dean . So cool . Brian , your secret weapon seems to have misfired . Hey ! Come on , we doin ' this or what , D ? Oh ! No , I 'm not here to fight . You 're our welcome buddy . What ? She 's supposed to show us around and ... stuff . Alright , sorry guys . Duty calls . Let 's go . And this concludes your tour of VGHS . You took us in a straight line and said nothing . Hey , Jenny doesn 't have time to show us noobs around . She 's got the whole JV team to worry about . Speaking of which ... Give me five reasons I should put you on my team . That was pretty transparent , wasn 't it ... ? Yeah , a bit . Reason number one , I 'm honest to a fault ! You probably shouldn 't list one of your faults as a reason . It 's okay , Ki , she 's gone . Wait , that 's not okay , I don 't know where my room is ! Seriously , guys , fun 's over , right ? What 's wrong , baby Wong ? Thought you rockstars knew how to party . Yeah , totally , Annihilist ! Totally , yeah ! Okay , you guys got me . Oh , hey ! Ted Wong . Ki Swan . 1360 points . Fighter . Welcome to the Frag Floor , Ki- - Hey , leave him alone . What 're you gonna do about it ? Stop us ? Nope . You 're not .

What 's this ? I don 't know . Something stupid . Chiba ? Hanzo ? Where 'd you get this , the poor store ? Where 'd you get your manners ? The ... rude store ? Oh my goodness ! Aw , sweet burn , dude ! Nobody ... insults my manners . Well nobody makes fun of my gear . And no one insults my new best friend . This sounds like a challenge . Woah , woah ... you guys can 't fight in my hallway . Rumble in the Rumpus Room ! Ladies and gentlemen ! I present to you a match-up of epic proportions . In the cool corner we got , Brian D ! And in the other corner we have some loser that was hardcore guffin ' me . Alright , y 'all know the rules ! Single life , no respawns . Player one , are you ready ? Let 's do it ! New best friend , are you ready ? Brian , I just looked at the official rulebook . I really think that you should look at paragraphs 12 through 90 . Any chance you could paraphrase ? Oh okay , um . Read rules . Important . That 's not what I meant , Ki ! Alright , let 's get it on ! You can 't hide from me ! You 're like a minnow , and I 'm a shark , I 'm gonna eat ' cha . Great timing , Chiba . Yes ! Yes ! Ha ha ! Who 's working at the poor store now ? Wait , what just happened ? Oh , Brian . Paragraph 90 , Section 3 . Should a student 's rank fall below zero , then they are automatically , ruthlessly and instantly- - Expelled . Annihilist , dude , I didn 't know ... Four more reasons , Brian . Welcome to VGHS . Jenny , wait ! Where 's my room ? ! On the plus side , dude ... That guy was supposed to be your roommate . Dude , I just got a kid expelled . How is that a plus side ? YEAH ! Best roommate friends forever ! I 'm okay . The one-shot wonder . We meet at last . Hey ! Uh , the , uh ... The Law ... It 's just Law around here , Brian . I don 't mean to pry , Bri-guy , but , uh ... Are you okay ? What 're doing here ? Just gettin some air ... You were gonna throw your gear out , weren 't you . I dunno . VGHS is a little bit different than I thought . Chiba and Hanzo just kinda feel out of place . Brian ... Look , who are we talkin ' about here . Your gear ? Or you . I know , right ? Stupid . Listen . Oh . Old school . Nice . Let me tell you something I 've always kind of told myself . Fitting in at VGHS is hard , but ... You can 't be the best , unless you be yourself . Okay ? Never ... never forget that . Never let anyone break you . Do you really mean that ? More than anything in the world . Chiba ! Too bad you 're in my world now , Brian . Don 't you get it , Brian ! ? I am VGHS ! Welcome ... to me ! How are you lost ? You 're the RA ! Hey , you 're the one who overslept . Well , I 'm sorry , I had to practice with my new game deck if I want to get good and impress Jenny Matrix . Hey , Brian . Loved watching you kill Annihilist last night- - Very impressive . How would you like a spot on JV ? Are you serious ? Double-stuf serious . JV could use a boost in the cute department . Welcome to the team ... .. and welcome TO ME ! Is anyone else hearing this ? Nope . Cheeto ... ? Killing spree . Mornin ' roomie ! Pizza brunch ? What is with everyone today ? Well ... You killed the number one player at the school ... .. you got a guy kicked out on your first day ... You 're a marked man , Brian . Just like this pizza ! Everyone wants a piece of you ! I gotta keep my head down ... You 're right- - we could throw you a party . - What ? - In your honor . I didn 't say that ... Called Brianpalooza . No ! Hi ! Brian ! I had a question about Brianpalooza . Did you take this while I was sleeping ? I have a very aggressive street team . I was just wondering what time " Rock o 'clock " is ? You know- - half past rad . But when is half past rad ? I 'm not gonna throw them a party . Can we please just hang out by this stairwell ? Look at this view ! This could be our new hangout spot , am I right ? Wow ! I can 't believe I hadn 't thought of it . I 'll add it to my list that I made of potential hangout spots . Really ? Okay . A party 's one thing , but you can 't even walk past The Law ? Come on it 's time to stop hiding in the shadows and shine like the star that you are ! I 'll stick to the shadows , thanks . I 'll see you in class . What 's gaming all about , Brian ? Well , um ... - I always thought that ... - I 'm sure if I looked at Brian 's Big Book of Gaming ... It 'd tell me that gaming 's all about expelling classmates ... Starting fights ... Landing the cover of The Wall Street Journal . You know what gaming 's really about , Brian ? Boom . It 's all about the game . Gaming 's ... all about the game , sir ? I knew you wouldn 't understand . You 're in the danger zone , kid . You may have snapped a few points wasting Annihilist , but ... If you want to last more than a week at this school ... I suggest you start keeping a low profile . I-I hear you , sir . I was actually just telling my friends : " Low profile " - - that 's my game . Really . Does that game include a minigame about being full of crap ! ? Now get out of my office . Okay . Hello students , and welcome to FPS 101 . My name is Ace . You can call me Ace . Sound good ? Fantastic . Now I 'm sure a lot of you are thinking right now : " Hey . I got myself into VGHS . What 's with all the back to basics baloney ? " Well . Let me just set the record straight for you pardners real quick like ... You don 't know shinola about first person shootin Freshman year is about two things , hear me now ... Fundamentals ... and first impressions . Brian D , I presume ? Sorry I was late , sir . Well you 've already broken Ace 's first rule . Be punctual . No . Rule # 1 is " Know Ace 's Rules . " You 'd have known that had you been punctual . Have a seat . - Brian ! - Sorry I 'm late , Mr. Ace . Call me Ace , alright ? Mr. Ace was my father 's name Rule # 1 , Brian ! - Now , back to first impressions ... - Dude . - The first girl y 'all ought to be impressin' - Check out who our TA is ... is our straight shootin ' TA over here Jenny Matrix . That 's right , Ace . As JV captain I have to choose an honorary freshman to play in our scrimmage against Varsity tomorrow . Personally , I think it 's a huge waste of time but ... It 's tradition . Brian ! That could be you wasting her time tomorrow ! I don 't know , Ki , I ... The scrim is a perfect opportunity to be rubbing ' elbows with some of the best mouse jockies this high school has to offer . Jenny you think any of these cheesedusters has what it takes ? Well there 's only one way to find out , Ace ... Let 's hit The Pit . I cannot wait . People underestimate The Pit because your targets are made of paper . But trust me . When you know The Pit ... You know yourself . Playing games by yourself ? I got better things to do in my sleep ! This is great ! I can totally do this level in my sleep ! Yeah , great . So , Ki ... Back to our favorite romance languages ... What were yours again ? Spanish ? Italian ? C + + . " Very good . " Be fast . Be efficient . And above all else ... Be resourceful . Thirty-nine seconds ... That 's not bad , Matrix . Just shy of the school record . Wait , that 's not right . You can get like ten seconds faster than that ... Brian D ! Something to share ? No , sir . Ah ... sorry . Uh ... Wasn 't important . Good . Then shut up . Brian was just saying he can complete the course much faster than you , Jenny . Well , la-dee-freakin-da . I 'd love to see that . What about you , class ? Honorary freshman , honorary freshman ... C 'mon Brian . Show us what you got . Try not to wet yourself , noob . That 's somewhat ... unorthodox . Brian ... I am disappoint . Cheer up , Brian ! - At least no one wants to fight you anymore ! - I figured it out ! Rock o 'clock is 3 : 32 ! We 've missed Brianpalooza . Calhoun wants me dead ... I 'm late for Ace 's class ... Oh ! And I can forget about playing in that scrimmage because Jenny probably thinks I 'm the biggest dork in the universe ! So ! Jenny 's here ! What up , Matrix ? What , uh ... Brings you to our neck of the cafeteria ... .. woods ? Well , I was going to invite you to my party because that was one of the sickest pit runs I 've ever seen ... but um ... I 'm sorry , could you just ... ? Oh ! Sunglasses indoors ... I must look like a douchebag , what was I thinking ? We 'll clean this up , we 'll definitely be there ! I hope this party is more organized than Brianpalooza . Sure . You guys can totally invite yourselves . Okay . My place . Tomorrow night . Sounds groovy , Jenny ! Or should I say ... Gravy - Brian . She 's gone . Party ... this could be like ... Our first date ! First ... date ... ? - Awesome ! - Three-way fist pound ? Brian . This way ! Oh ! Brian !

Let 's go Coco-nuts ... " Wait you 're gonna bribe your way into JV with a cake ? Coconut cake . Let 's just say I 'm a 12th level pastrymancer and once she tastes this bad boy , I 'm in . Maybe this date will become a double date ! Oh ! Brian ! I was meaning to tell you something ... What was it , what was it , what was it ... Brian D ! You made it ! Hey , Jenny ... um ... Oh ! My gosh ! I totally nailed it , I have to show you ! Come to my room ! Well ... what should I do with this bad boy ? I dunno . Give it to the party . Let them eat cake ! Come on- - hurry !

I play manly games now like , uh , War and ... Oh my God you 're a 12th level dancemancer ? Did I say " baby game " because I meant , uh ... " babe game " for , uh , people . No it is a baby game .

You already made me quite the Brian D. Let 's play again . Brian D ? More like Brian Z. The last letter in the alphabet . Ooo yeah ! Don 't even listen to him , dude . Ted , please , I don 't even ... know what that means . Well Z is the la ... You know I don 't even have time to explain to you how sick of a burn ... Ted ? Ted ! What happened ? You okay ? You passed out for like 27 minutes ! I 'm fine . I just ... You 've seen them haven 't you , Theodore ? Hi , Drift King . The visions . What are they ? Merely a side effect ... of drift fever ! You 've got the blood , Ted ! You can 't escape this now ! I 'm signing up for rythm gaming and there 's nothing you can do to stop me ! Confound it ! Why must you Brian D your future way on this dying sport ? Look at me in the eye . Tell me how hammer-ons and pull-ups can possibly compare to the G force pull of an A + J turn ? The thrum of a rumble chair as you careen past the checkered flag ... The churning in your chest , as you hear those three magical words : NEW-LAP-RECORD . Got ... a class , I gotta go to class . Yoga class , let 's go ! - That 's on thursday . - I don 't care . Let 's go . Okay ! Ted , even a man as fast as you can 't run away from himself forever ! Hey buddy , look , I got you ... uh . Ah , my thanks Ted 's vassal . Though in the future , I prefer , sour cream and onions . Who are you ? Hey there , champ . How are you holding up ? Great , great , yeah totally great . Yeah , this is nothing compared to our old school , those old guys really knew how to haze . Really ? Well , I guess we 'll just have to step it up a notch then . JK , I 'm just rattling you , bro ! So ... you good ? Good ? Yeah , no , I 'm great , you know , it 's totally great . You 're great , I 'm great , you 're with The Law , that 's great , by the way . I 'm by myself , that 's great . Yeah , no , everything is great . Good . I have to go set up a practice but ... I 'm glad that you 're ... .. doing great ! I 'll catch you later , babe . I really am d ... Brian D ! My office , now ! The school took a risk on you , Brian . You let us down . Have a seat , kid . Sir . Sir , I know I screwed up at scrimmage , but I figured with try-outs still right around the corner . VGHS try-outs are streamed across the world . And you 're one point away from expulsion . Administration doesn 't like those odds . So what are you saying ? I 'm saying you 're circling the drain . We don 't need some kid Brian D-ing all over our reputation . That new catchphrase is the exact reason why administration is asking you to ragequit on your own accord . We 're asking you to- - that 's a good coffee- - we 're asking you ... to leave VGHS . Hey ! Kick back the hover ball ! Tough day , Brian ? Oh hey , Games ! What do you want ? Just wondered if you dropped this . How did you get that ? Well it 's a funny story . I told you . Stick to Games . I 'm totally a catch . That 's my favorite game ! No baby . That 's our favorite game . Great . Well , enjoy the game . Oh , I will . But not as much as Jenny will enjoy your cute little ... Oh , I like you but I don 't have the balls to say so-note . Well per chance The Law will succomb to your ... .. " Don Juan " thing marksmanship . Are you kidding me ? This place is ridiculous ! It 's my time in the spotlight , Brian ! And you 're standing in my way . It 's Game 's time . Wow ! It 's Game 's time ! That 's cute . You got yourself a little brand . I like that . You know what , Games ? You want the spotlight ? You can have it ! But first here 's what we 're gonna do . We 're going to throw it down . I 'm gonna stomp your face . I 'm gonna make you cry , in front of your two ... stupid friends , whose names I don 't even wanna know . You see , Games , I 'm one point away from expulsion . And I 'm gonna use that point on all 3 of you noobs . I figured you 'd say something like that . - Assault rifles ? - Oh , let 's get an SMG in there . You funeral . Best at three ? - First to five ! - Games on . See ya ! I 'm destroying you ! - What are you doing here ? - Saving your ass . Yeah , well , it 's a little late . Dammit Brian , what the hell are you doing ? I 'm leaving on my own accord . Yeah , I set you up . But you know what ? You wanted to be in that game , and you screwed it up . So you can blame me , you can blame the whole damn school . But right here , right now , it is all on you . Let 's dance . But ... but it was Games ' time ! This isn 't over , Brian D. Crownies ? Let 's roll . Thanks for the assist . Yeah , you 're welcome . You should play like that more often . See you at sign-ups tomorrow . You can kiss your high scores good bye ! Yeah , good luck with that , captain . Hey , Jenny , thanks for giving me a shot . No matter how cool your are , better practice those 5-star songs if you plan on taking me on , Brian . Sup Deansters ! It 's me again , Games Dean . Big news today , Brian D did totally challenge me and my friends to a match . He came in all like , Ew ew what ! And I was all like , What ? So , we were beating them up . 'Til Jenny comes out of nowhere , all like , No ! Don 't hurt Brian ! I 'm like , What ? She 's like , Don 't ! Yeah , Law 's Jenny ... I was like completely shocked . Then she made us lose , and then like after we lost and were leaving those two are macking on each other . Moving in on another guy 's girl , Brian , I wouldn 't want to be you when Law finds out cause he 's going to be like , WHAT ! ? That 's the Daily Dean , we 're going to be doing more of that all week long and month here on VGHS . Just stop in Tuesday , Wednesday , Thursday , 3 : 30 to 4 : 45 and I 'll be giving you all the goodness you 've just got here today . See ya , guys . Well , it 's only got like 400 views . Nice moves last night , lover boy . Brian , VGHS only has like 400 students . Huh , I should probably go talk to Jenny . Nah . Nah , I should probably go talk to Jenny . It 's ok ? Are you ok there , boy ? Ted is presenting his new features at drift racing to freddie today I think he 's got butterflies . I don 't have butterflies , I 've got DRAGONFLIES ! We don 't need your presentation , imma tell him right now . Oh there 's Jenny . I 'm probably gonna go talk to her . Yeah , I probably should pretend to not sit Ted for a few seconds , then wheel him into Freddie 's room . Yeah , don 't let him eat anything in there , ok . Right . Heey . Um , about today 's Daily Dean Whatever , Games Dean is an idiot . Right ? Yeah he is ! Total ! You beat it . Oh yeah , all your highscores too . Great . Oh , don 't worry it wasn 't hard . Oh ! So basically I suck . Yeah , ehm ... speaking of that ... We can 't really hang out anymore . What ? Or be friends ... now that came out wrong . Brian , I think that you 're cool but The Law is Varsity captain , and my parents expect me to make the team . So I can 't have people talking about you and me . So , wait , wait , wait ... you 're telling me that Law won 't put you on the team because he thinks that you and I ... just answered my question . wow . So are we cool ? Cool ? No ! We 're not cool , we 're like the opposite of cool like ... Jenny , when you and I played last night it was ... Awesome , I know . I 'm sorry , I have to go . And that is why I am going to sign up for drift racing this year . I love you , dad . Mr. Wong , we all know Ted will never be a great rythm gamer , he just needs to hear you say it . You 'll never be a great rythm gamer . I knew it . And that concludes our meeting ! You know how many losers told me that on my way to the top ? Pro shredders aren 't born , Ted , they are forged to the fire and the flames . Really ? Of course . See you 're a Wong , you 're born to be a pro shredder . The reason I bust your chops is because I know you 've got what it takes . I got it . I knew you really cared . Now stop whammering and start hammering on that is , practice-wise ... Hey , see you at the sign-ups . I won 't let you down this year . Thanks Ki-wy . The presentation was tops ! So , you 're Ted 's first groupie . Ki Swan 1360 points , fighter . I don 't like you . On to the wise Ki-wy , you 've been his lady for what ... a week ? I 'm his father twice a month a weekend for his entire life . Ted stays where he belongs , you hear me . IN MY SHADOW ! Attention players , one hour left to sign ups for clan try-outs . Choose your team carefully because once you swipe that card , your fate is sealed . Brian , hey ! Are you to top off my lemonade or ... Oh wait , I 'm sorry , That 's why I have her . Thanks , babe . Just here to sign up . That is precious . Here 's the deal , Brian . I did you a favour by sparing your life , remember ? So , now you 're going to do me a favor by not signing up . Sorry Law , the favour train has left the station . Last chance , tanner-tom , are you sure you want to do this ? What would you do , Law ? I think you would sign up , but you 're not The Law ! Are you ? Believe me , Brian , I get it , you want to be this . Listen to Law 's lesson , loser . Everybody hates you , Literator . I mean who wouldn 't ? I 've got it all . I 've got the looks . I 've got the brains . Ehm ... Check me by the way . I 've got the whole school in the palm of my hand , but wait , there 's more ! I 've got the girl of your dreams , eSsen my D. Styling My Do . So , you want to be this , Brian D ? You want to be The Law ? Well you 've got to get through The Law first . Hey , Ki ! Sorry I ditched you back there . Did you and my dad get the chance to talk ? Yes , we did . And he 's your father ... I have to get to the fighting sign-ups , Ted . Why ? I tought you wanted to make games . Hey , what better resources than playing with the best . Goodbye . Hey , Ki , wait up ! Yo , Little Wong ! Making a graph on how bad you suck . I made that graph leave him alone . It 's cool , Ki . Hey guys , how is it going ? Ted for rythm gaming this year came to join the team finally . You mean you 're actually going to sign up again ? How me suffer why ? Because ... I ... Oh my god , The Law is trolling Brian D. I gotta go help my friend . Goodbye , guys KEEP ALL MY STUFF . That guy should litterally be doing anything but rythm gaming . Why are you doing this ? You 've already proved you 're better than me . Brian , dude . It 's because I can , because it 's fun . And because you made it personal . The spotlight wasn 't enough , so you had to move in on my girl . Dude , we 're just ... we 're not even friends . Whatever . So , on to you . Cozy up to Jenny so you two can play on JV ? Didn 't you hear ? She 's getting on Varsity . Yeah , her boyfriend runs the team ! Oh , I love gossip . Let 's dish , did you also hear , oh yeah , her boyfriend doesn 't give a shit , Jenny stays on JV , This is my year and noone else 's . So , I suggest you skidaddle , go practicing your dance moves , Brian . Sign-ups are closed . This is too good for you , Law ? Oh my god . Somebody S my D. Stay away from him . Back off ! Okay , I 've got your back . What are you waiting for ? Let 's go ! To war ! Are you wounded , Theodore ? This doesn 't change anything . BRIAN D ! Yes , Calhoun ? I 'm expelled ? I gave you a chance to leave quietly , and this is how you use it ? Assaulting a student ? Initiating a brawl ? Stealing a hat ? And worst of all , Brian , worst of all , you forgot that it 's all about the game ! Sir , please you can 't do this . Yes I can . It 's done , you 're facing a 300 point abduction , 300 points you do not have . You 've got to be joking . Do you hear any rotflcopters , son ? Pack your thing and get out of my school ! Are you more like a rockstar everyday , kiddo . What ? Is this a joke ? Am I a joke to you ? No no no no . There must be some mistake . You know , Ted , you want to bail on the Wong , that 's fine ... but getting some groupie to take your place ? That 's pathetic . Dad . Dad your face , now get out of mine , forever ! Welcome to the team , Theodore . You switched the cards . Er ... reason one , as I explained in my previous presentation ... I don 't care about your stupid graphs , Ki . My dad hates me because of you . That brings us to reason two , Ted , your dad hates you , and not because of me , I mean , from before . We 're through , Ki . Ehm ... ok . I know you 're upset . If we think about this objectively . OBJECTIVELY you 've ruined my life . I never want to see you again . But I was just looking out for you . Look out for me ? Look form over there ! Get out of my face , forever . Did you really want me to ... Just go ! Hi . Jenny , I 'm sorry . Sorry for punching Law in front of the school , or for ruining my chances of making Varsity this year ? Yes , both of these things , and before you hit me again there 's something I 've got to take off of my chest . What ? That you like me ? That you were just sticking up for me against my big mean boyfriend ? Look , I get that you 're upset we can 't be friends , but you 're not the only one who has a tough round here , ok ? If you can 't suck it up then leave . Hey ! You 'd be happy to know I just got expelled . SO , I am leaving . Oh , and your big mean boyfriend , he told me he 's not going to put you in the team anyway . So , at least you 've got a show out of it . You 're an asshole . Previously , on VGHS Jenny , make Varsity ? Not on my watch . You signed me up for drift racing . Ted , I 'm sorry . I 'm splitz-fied , baby . We 're through . You 're expelled . Pack up your dreams and go . Ted stays where he belongs , in my shadow ! What 're you doing , Brian ? Why did you throw it on the way ? Because you 're too good for him , Jenny , and because I 'm in love with you . Thanks Mr. D. Another busy night Mr. D. It 's always a busy night ... Knock yourself up . Is ... Is that Brian D ? See if he will play a game with us . I 'm sorry , Brian never games with the customers . Come on , scram scrow . Go back to VGHS , Jumper Jax . Whatever , quitter . Yeah , I 'll go . Always looking out for a little guy . Ted ? How long has it been ? Twentyfour hours ? You have it D , it 's a day ! Come on let 's go get a slice . Alright ! And then Calhoun told me I can 't switch to rythm gaming , cause once you 've signed up you 're locked in the system . It goes a butt . Same old story . Calhoun always wins ... But it 's a story with a twist ending . You signed up , you 're still in the system , you can totally try out tomorrow . It 's taking worse when you 're expelled . And even if I did , tomorrow is not good for me . We 've got this huge birthday party coming . Dude , come on . As much as I love what you 've done to the place , it ain 't VGHS . Uhm ... That 's kind of the idea . You actually play games for fun here . Tell me we didn 't have fun together ? We had some swell times . To better days . So ... How are you , Ted ? I was really sad to hear about you and Ki . Never say to me that name again . What name ? My name ? Ki . Ki ! What a surprise ! Oh yes , hello . Here . Will you stop being mad at me now ? Brian , tell Ki that fixing my guitar doesn 't make up for breaking my hopes and dreams . Ted , tell Brian that you were being a big stupid dumb jerk . Brian , Ki says I 'm a big stupid ... Dammit . So , Ki , it 's been a while ... It 's been one day , Brian . Ah , ok . Hey you , loser ! Can 't hail the rock ? Than you 'd better whack , away . Remember , while you still do drugs you 're a loser , so why you don 't stop playing and go taking some drugs , loser ? Whoa , you suck . Why is Ted so stupid ? Ted isn 't ... Ergh .. Ted is different ... I apologised to him and he 's still mad at me . I should be mad at him . I am mad at him . I 'm sucking at rythm gaming just because I tried to fix his problems . Woah , Ki , you can 't always fix other people 's problems for them . I mean sometimes , problems are just unsolvable . Like the Hars conjuncture ? Think it like this : Ted is ... like you gömböc . That you 've been looking on . I mean sure , sometimes he get knocked around , but you gotta trust himself to pick him back up . Even though he doesn 't know you have to see . Brian , thank you . So , you 're running an Arcade now ? Hey , Jenny . It 's pretty rad . Best thing ever right ? I know , but ... I 'm kinda busy at the momento so ... Look . Brian , I 'm not really the best at apologises , but I just wanted ... Jenny we 're cool , I mean ... I was being a jerk too . Now , why don 't you go play some games , like over there ? On the house . Okay still you 're getting kicked out and school sucks without you Brian so ... I 'm sorry . Don 't be , really I mean , it worked out for the better . Look at this place . Ted was actually in here , like telling me I can actually try out and stuff . You can still try out tomorrow ? Yeah , but it 's not like it did let me get back in . So what ? People are saying that I can 't make Varsity just because I broke up with The Law , but you know what , if I kick enough ass out there , there 's nothing he can do to stop it . I 'm sorry I tought that playing at VGHS was like your dream or whatever , you 're telling me you have one last shot at your dream and you 're just gonna walk away ? Seriously what the hell is wrong with you , really ? Broke up with The Law ? Oh my God , that 's what you 've got out of this . No , I mean , I was just saying ... You really think I 've got a shot ? At the tryouts ... Yeah ... I think you have a shot at the tryouts . That 's what I meant . Totally . Good . So , will you be there tomorrow ? No , Jenny . I mean even if they let me back on it 's not like VGHS is going to change . Good luck out there . You know , we 've never played DXM ... I tought it was a baby game ? I think you 're just saying that because you know you 're going to lose . Oh , really ? What do you say a hundred pipe so that we dance ? This isn 't Fields Of Fire , I mean Skeeball . You should be embarassed . I 'll never love you . You 're right , I 'm being a big dumb stupid jerk . I know you 're just trying to protect me and I 'm sorry that you 're stuck to rythm gaming with my dad . Okay , I deserved that . Please , forgive me . I really miss you , Ki . Can we please be friends again ? Oh gosh ... You know one last shot of my dream . I can go for that . Good . This is Brian D with nothing to lose and he 's one of my team . Alright , captain , almost nothing . Almost ? Hey , Brian . Jenny . Ki and I made up , and by made up , I mean made out . If you know what I mean our lips touched . Great , I 'm super happy for you . So , what were you guys up to ? Uh , uh ! Four way high five ! It 's time in this year again , when legends are ripped , screaming and bloody from the womb of glory . That 's just one of the many disgusting ways we 'll be describing the white knuckle action of VGHS' FPS clan tryouts . Live here in our mobile studio in grand theft auditorium ... And speaking of legends our special guest of today eats legends for brunch ... Hey , Law , hope you grabbed a snack for the match . Ehm , I did , Scott , thank you . So , Law , we 've got 84 students going for just 12 JV and Varsity jants ... Any pro tips for your fellow mouse jockeys , before they get ready for the death ? Well , I don 't know about pro tips , but let me tell you something I once told a promising young newblade . VGHS is about being the best , but you can 't be the best , you must be yourself . So , before you walk in the tryouts today I want you to dig deep before you walk through these doors ... I want you to find out what drives you , cause once you find that out , once you know what it is to truly game , then nobody can break you . You guys are ready to go ? Chiba , Honzo ! How did you ... ? Fished them out of the dumpster . You didn 't think I 'd let you actually throw your gear , did you ? I fixed them for you , they should be fully functional . And I 've added a few ... upgrades . You guys know you 're the best friends ever , right ? We are ? Of course we are ! Now let 's go playing some video games . Now we 've seen some great action today , but this final match is the one that everyone is gabbing about . In the red corner : the leanest , the meanest FPS-est varsity crew this school has ever seen . They must have a pretty good captain ... And in the blue corner : a rad tad group led by Jenny Matrix who 's fighting to be the first sophomore ever to make it onto the VGHS' Varsity team . Doesn 't help that she 's down a man due to Brian D 's expulsion . Yes , we 've got you to thank for that , Law . Look , when a troublemaker like Brian comes into a school ... STFU Law , it 's Brian D ! Noo ! No ! Don 't you understand the maning of the world " expelled " , D ? I signed up , I 'm still in the system , the rules say I can play . Pff , who sold you that load of molineux ? Around here I 'm the dungeon keeper , and my rules are in black and white . Looks like your fable ends here . I know it does ... It was my dream to play on a VGHS team and I screwed it up . Yes , you messed it up bad ! Like a failure . So , what are you doing on my battlefield ? This isn 't about you and me , it 's not about getting back in , it 's about one last chance to play with the best of the best , it 's about playing the game . So , at the end of the day , Calhoun , it 's all about the game . GG Brian D. He plays ! I can 't believe that worked . Check out Brian D 's old school gear ! Don 't tell me he 's that one he smoke you with , Law-lipop . Alright , everybody calm down , the game is about to start . You 've shown up late again , uh , Brian ? You never seem to learn , do you ? Rule No 1 , Ace , never give up . Rule No 271 , Never quote my rules back to me . Now sit your punk ass down and best wishes . You all know the routine , you keep it clean up there . Match begins in thirty seconds , get busy fragging or get busy dying . COUNTDOWN . Alright bring it in . You should 've stayed home Brian , you 're going to ruin it for all of us . Yeah , you 're expelled , you 've no chance of making JV . Hey ! I 've seen these two cats meow , and it 's about to be a fancy fist tonight . You plan on bringing the thunder ? You know it . Good enough for me . Jenny ? Now that you 've all worked out your feelings , are you ready to kick some ass ? Fry my circuits ! D and Jenny 've just grabbed the case ... Bust out your butts and putt butt bibbs on these butts zoners because this combo is bubble . Please , grabbing the case is the easy part , let 's see how these butts do on the long way back . How crowdass that kid can play . I hate that kid . Bullim ! Underclassmen draw first blood ! Law , looks like your ex girlfriend and arch rival are really kicking your team 's ass . Jenny Matrix has almost dome ... These underclassmen are one point away from the biggest upset in clan tryout 's history . And that 's not all , Shotbot , another round like that and Brian D could actually get back in , into VGHS . Now how 's that do ya , Law ? He 's gone . He left . Alright , you three left flank , everyone else , with me . This is it , g ... THE LAW HAS ENTERED THE GAME . The Law ? Game over , man . Game over , our faces . Okay , everybody calm down , don 't panic , as long as we keep our ... HEADSHOT . Law ready for this ? Run ! Yowza ! Lesson learned , hell hath no fury like a Law scorned ! I know me some ownage , but that 's got to be of the fastest case grabs I 've ever ... Oh great Carmak 's gosth ! He scored again . Tie game ! You knwo what that means , Colonel Slanders . It 's time for a sudden death ! 3 minutes , no respawns , no mercy . Ladies and gentlemen , it does not get better than this , two stories , one villan of Quakesperian proportions , and it all comes down to this final play . Jenny , Brian , make it a good one . Everybody stop ! We can still win this thing . Get real , Matrix , we 're down-zo ... The Law is coming for me . The Law is here because I 'm here . So , I say let him have me . You know you 're almost in school , right ? I know . Alright , here 's the plan ... LAW ! He 's mine . Jenny ... Law ... Awkward . So , what 's happening , captain ? Should we just shoot each other ? Oh , we could , but that won 't get you on Varsity know , would it ? Here 's how this is gonna work , you 're gonna go grab the intel . I 'm going to say hi to Brian , and I 'll see you at Varsity practice tomorrow . You think I 'd be caught dead on your team ? Matrix , please , I should go before people start talking . Hey , Brian ! Argh . Argh ! Jenny just shot me in the back ... Oh , wait , no . I 'm sorry , she just stabbed you in the back ! Really , Brian ? Really ? I gotta admire your gumption , kid . You really want to play this game one last time ? Okay . The clock 's ticking , so , why don 't you put that ' nade on your nogging , and we 'll put this all " is anybody better than The Law " issue to bed . Brian , move the face , I 'm not the bad guy here , you were nothing and nobody , and then you met me and the whole world gave you a shot , and you blew it . You proved you 're a nothing , but surprise , here 's your pal The Law . Coming here to give you a last chance , so are you gonna take it ? Come on , you 've got nothing to lose ... Almost nothing . Law ready for THAT ? Brian D , congratulations , you 're once again the lowest ranked player in VGHS . Welcome to the team . Thanks . I 'm sorry about Varsity . It 's ok . I 'm happy with what I 've got . Sorry , I was completely unprofessional . It 's ok . I am your captain now , though . Oh , well it won 't happen again , captain . That was your first kiss , wasn 't it ? And my last , cause now I 'm going to die . Brian , it was ... I 'm ... .. it was good . Good , cause that was the last one , right ? Yeah . I hate this school . Practice starts tomorrow . See you there , captain . Hey , sorry DK . I 'll catch you later . Sleep well , young Theodore . For we drift ! AT daybreak . Oh , hey , Ted , turns like your girlfriend here is quite a rocker . She can learn a thing or two ... I 'm sure she is , da ... She 's pretty awesome at anything . Ted you can play cool all you want , but you know at the end of the day ... Look , that 's Brian ! Oh , see you later , popps . Brian freaking D ! Congratulations , Brian . I knew you 'd make it back ! Roommates forever ! Thanks , guy . Wow , you 've made your teams ! Yes , she melted my old man 's face off , litterally . Oh , no , not litterally , but I did really well . So did Ted . Put your jacket on , let 's get some victory pizzas ! Pizza sounds great right about now .

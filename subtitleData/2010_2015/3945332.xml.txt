 Previously on Caprica ... { pos ( 192,210 ) } My wife is gone , and I 've got to get her back . I 'm very confused . I don 't know what you want from me . I want you to be real ! I want you to be her ! { pos ( 192,210 ) } To bring down the STO , I need a person on the inside . { pos ( 192,210 ) } You 're not objective , jordon . Back off from this . We don 't have anything on Clarice Willow . Yes , sir . You want me to spy on my friend ? If Clarice Willow is who I think she is , we could take down the entire STO. - The people who murdered your daughter . { pos ( 192,210 ) } Where there is faith there is hope . The avatar is gone . Wasn 't there a backup ? She had a pin . If she had a backup , that 's where she would have kept it . I think some time off-world would be very healthy . There 's a program on Gemenon , training for STO recruits . There 's been enough blood . When passing through security , please have identification and boarding pass ready . The white zone is for immediate loading and unloading of passengers only . Do you speak Caprican ? Everybody speaks Caprican . Well , do you know if there 's a pickup area for passengers connecting to other destinations ? Nope . I 'm a stranger here myself . What are you doing here ? Internship . You ? Boarding school . Odin Sinclair ? Lacy Rand . That 's me . We better get moving . The jump ship 's already started boarding . You two are with me . You 're STO ? You don 't have to look so surprised . Hang on . We 're taking off . I hate this . I hate this . I hate this . I hate this . Suck it up . Everything 's gonna be all right . We 're leveling off . It 's okay . See ? So ... You a true believer ? I don 't know anymore . How about you ? No , my parents are the zealots in the family . They forced you to come here ? They had two armed goons storm into my bedroom in the middle of the night , knock me out , and load me into a shuttle . I woke up halfway to Gemenon . Attention , please . My name is Diego . I welcome you all to the holy birthplace of monotheism . We 're on our way now to the retreat where the reverend holy mother lives . You will enter children , and you will exit warriors of the one true God ... Those of you that survive . What is that ? It 's a ship . It 's on top of us . It 's the pollys . - They 've been too easy lately . - They 're locking onto us . Shake them off ! Shake them off ! Come on ! What are you doing ? Oh , you scared me . Are you spying on Clarice ? No . Of course not . No . Mar-beth , I 'm ... I don 't know how to say this , but ... I think she might be using again . - What ? - Yeah . She 's up at all hours . She 's not eating , and she 's been going into her room with her door shut . - It 's just the signs are there . - She hasn 't touched purple for months . Yeah . I know my wife better than you do . Well , I hope I 'm wrong . I care about her too , you know . Zoe 's infinity pin has to be in Global Defense somewhere , picked up in the sweep of the house . Tell our person to look wherever they store the evidence . Tell them I don 't care if their cover is blown . This is really important . Calm down , Clarice . It 's covered . They got a seal . They 're gonna try to board us . They 're gonna try to board us . Does anybody know what he 's saying ? He says the many Gods are striking back . No . No . { fad ( 2000,500 ) } Lords of Kobol : Before the Fall V. 1.00 { pos ( 192,230 ) } It 's the only thing I could come up with . She had me dead to rights . { pos ( 192,230 ) } Are you positive she believed you ? { pos ( 192,230 ) } I don 't know . { pos ( 192,230 ) } Maybe . Yes . Maybe . I don 't know . { pos ( 192,230 ) } Amanda , just promise me you 'll be careful . { pos ( 192,230 ) } Did you learn anything useful ? No . No , I ... { pos ( 192,230 ) } If I could get closer , I could . { pos ( 192,230 ) } If you could get me a camera or a bug , I could plant it in Clarice 's room . { pos ( 192,230 ) } She hasn 't trained herself not to vocalize when she uses her Holoband . { pos ( 192,230 ) } - Maybe ... - { * The problem is , } No , If I go in for a warrant , I 'm gonna have to admit I have a { * confidential } informant in the Willow house . I 'm not willing to do that . I 'm not willing to die . { pos ( 192,230 ) } I can 't let them catch me eavesdropping again . They will kill me . Okay . { pos ( 192,220 ) } Warrants are overrated anyway . I 'll get you the tech . What , you don 't trust your own people ? It saves disappointment later . Spy-cam ? Building a case against your exes ? { pos ( 192,190 ) } That 's a good one , sir . No , it 's related to the bombings . It 's a shame , ' cause , I 'd like to hear you say the words , " I have a warrant for this . " { pos ( 192,220 ) } Relax . { pos ( 192,210 ) } It 's background . You got a CI placed somewhere ? { pos ( 192,210 ) } You know better than to ask me that , especially when we both know there 's a possibility we 've got a leak in this department . You think I 'm STO ? Of course not . Jordan , I 've given you a lot of leeway on this case . { pos ( 192,210 ) } Yes , and I haven 't divulged the identity of an active CI , not to anybody , not to my own mother . I need the jackets for any and all CI 'S you have in the field . - I won 't do it , sir . - And until I get that , { pos ( 192,210 ) } you don 't get so much as a paperclip . Believe it or not , you work for me . { pos ( 192,210 ) } I work for Caprica . { pos ( 192,230 ) } Forward . { pos ( 192,220 ) } What are we looking at here ? Zoom . You 're watching the Ha 'la 'tha steal and smuggle Cylons off-world . Hold . Is that true ? Tell me the Guatrau changed his mind . Tell me they 're going home to our people . Where , then ? Gemenon . Some crazy fringe group . You knew about this ! Which side ? Come on , with the Guatrau , it 's always about the money . - You know that . - Which side , Yusef ? STO . Oh , nice . We forsake the struggle of our own people , let them die in the streets . We sent no weapons to help them , but the frakkers who murdered your wife , - blew up your child ? - Don 't . No , I 'm glad the Guatrau found it in his heart to show them a little bit of love . No , no , no . Don 't you go getting pious on me . Do you think I like the position I 'm in ? We don 't ... What 's happened to you ? Where 's your outrage ? { * All right , } Here 's what I need . - Don 't talk right now . - I don 't really have a choice . If my government discovers we 've been exporting exclusively contracted technology to terrorists , it could blow directly back onto me . I could be executed for treason . And don 't think for a second that just because they 're coming after me , they won 't come after you and all your people . I need a one-on-one with the Guatrau . And what in the twelve worlds makes you think he 'd grant you that ? It 's always about the money , right ? What 's going on ? He 's taking us up into orbit . Stop frakking me around . We want all our prisoners . No , we will have all our people . The difference this time is that we have hostages to trade . Prisoner exchange . That 's good . - He needs us alive . - Why do we have their prisoners ? Who cares ? We care , because we have to get inside of their heads . We have to be smart . We are going to shoot one of these children . Do you understand ? Well , know what ? You leave me no frakking choice , do you understand me ? We are going to leave this channel open so that you can hear the shot . And if they scream , you will hear that too . - We need to fight back . - Keep it down . Come on , we 've got them outnumbered . We 're not professional killers . Understand that . We have to be smart . I 've been trading hand signals with the canceron and his buddy across the way . As time goes by , they 'll get hungry . They 'll get tired . They 'll get sloppy . And that 's when we move . Look ... If we can get it loose ... At least we have something . We 'll only have one shot at this . - You know , as zeus once said ... - But we have to make it count . Someone needs to go first , hmm ? Someone needs to be chosen . Yes . Well , the question is ... Who will it be ? Who is going to die for their loving God ... Their God that does not answer them , their God who is going to let them die ? Who is it going to be , hmm ? I like ... This boy right here . Wait , what ? Why me ? No , no , please don 't . Look , I 'll do anything . What do you want me to do ? I just want to go home . I 'm sorry . Please , I 'll do anything . - Get on your feet ... - I just don 't want to die . - And act like a man . - Please , I don 't want to die . Let go ! Now stand up ... On your pathetic legs and walk ! - I 'll do anything ! - Walk ! - I want you to walk ! - I don 't want to die ! Please don 't kill me . He 's begging . Beg to this man right here . - I 'll do anything . - Beg to him . He will do anything . But what will you do ? Kneel down ! - Please , don 't kill me . - Put your hands down . Put your hands down and move . Move ! Start the clock . Hey , Alpie . What 's the good word ? Got a pulse . Feeling good about that . You remember that Libran porn ring we busted last year ? I treasure the memories . - We still got that camera ? - We got everything . This is where old cases go to die . Do me a favor . Take a smoke break . - Be discreet . - Always . Frak . For the Gods ' sake , the rats have gotten in here . It 's a big city . Of course we got rats . Yell a little louder , why don 't you ? It 's junk . Anybody else been in here lately going through the Graystone evidence ? They would have signed in . Unless they 're you , obviously . What about after hours ? Could be . - Who 's got the entry code ? - Just the top brass . What 's this all about ? Nothing good . Thanks again . This ... This is my resurrection program . The commercial we watch with those cute little children , " Grace by Graystone . " That suggested one possible , very frivolous application . But when this program is complete , it will end death and disease . It will demolish our conception of mortality , { and } whomever controls this will transcend any { single } corporation , government , or syndicate . So anything we do now that jeopardizes this opportunity is ... You think my decision to sell your robots off-world is stupid . By arming terrorists , you gain short-term profit , but at the expense of the biggest potential payday in either of our organization 's history . How much time do you need to complete your program ? Three months ... Plus additional staff and resources . Two weeks . I 'll hold the export of the robots for that long . After that , you had better impress me . Of course , Guatrau . I 'll get it done . He 's a very ambitious man . We need to be careful , then . Brave too . I like him . He reminds me of myself at that age . But you 're right not to trust him . One must be careful with ambitious men . I gave him two weeks to deliver this new technology . If he succeeds , we 'll make money . If he fails , we 'll lose little . Either way , we need to protect ourselves . For Dr. Graystone 's journey . We 're killing him ? Do it quietly , Samuel . I will . Good . Now then , who 's hungry ? As the olympian Gods rose , the titans fell , as all Gods must . But no one God can kill them all . One God - This can only be mankind putting his own face into the heavens , making a God from his own image . - It 's the height of hubris . - We 've got a minute to do something The pantheon understands mercy . - Are they watching ? - No . You know what is in your heart . - You must make the right choice . - I can 't . It 's not ready yet . - We can 't just let someone die . - Kneel before the arrow of Apollo and renounce your monad God , and you will be spared . Do you understand ? Renounce , or you will be shot . I see . All the Gods were visible in the seven circles ... Kneel . And every God , by his own proper power , brought forth what was appointed him . I forswear the false God . Kiss the arrow of Apollo . Good boy . Find him something to eat . Put your arms down . Stand . Stand . You 're safe now . No one else ? You must be hungry . 30 seconds from now , you might wish you had taken the offer . Suit yourselves . Who will be next ? Stand . It 's okay . Come with me . May the one true God have mercy on your souls . She 's brave . Keep your eyes on them . Kneel . Hello , sweetheart . Haven 't seen you since that awful de-rezzing incident . I blame you just a little bit . Can 't tell your wife you killed a man and not expect a little healthy push-back . A marriage only works as an equal partnership . - So look out , mister . - What are you doing ? You said I { was } fawn { ing } too much . So { now } you 're { just } guessing what I want from you ? Which is a typical human reaction , if you think about it - Neurotic , adorable even - Very authentic . Make love to me . My entire future is riding on fixing the resurrection program { , which is you } . I have two weeks to pass you off as a { n emotionally } recognizable human being . - If I don 't , I 'm dead . - Let me take your mind off it . Every time I come { back in } here , you 're further off the mark . I 'm sorry . You make me nervous . If she were here and you were accusing her of being inauthentic , wouldn 't she react just like this ? I think she would - - Exactly like this . - She would be mad , in a rage . - We don 't have a control group . - We don 't . Because we don 't have her . Because you don 't have her . And I 'm glad , because you 're a frakking nasty ... monster who deserves to be alone ! And I hope you do die ! Was that better ? This isn 't working . Delete program . Of course , Daniel . Shall I upload the backup to the satellite drive ? Delete backup . My pleasure . Zoe 's pin ... Finally . Do you see anything - Anything attached ? It 's a storage device . There it is ... Just like the girl said . Now we have the key to the afterlife . Remember this moment , Olaf . They 're going to write about it in the holy scrolls . What ? You win . I have a CI . I knew it . - Where ? - Read it . Shred it . Don 't speak of it . Don 't log it { into an e-sheet } . I can 't have this woman burned . She trusts me . Fair enough . Plus , I get a blank check ... Any tech I want . Nothing crazy or off-budget . I just need room to operate freely . That 's the deal . Fine . She 's a good asset . She 's placed inside Clarice Willow 's house . We 're on the verge of cracking the STO . I know this was hard for you . Requisition whatever you need . We 're all on the same side . I know that , sir . I 'm just trying to protect my people . Listen carefully . I 'm about to tell you something that 's going to upset you . Tell me . My GDD contact tells me you have a spy in your house . Four minutes till air lock . We need to move . No , wait till he gets back on the phone . If we wait , someone dies . No talking . We 're not talking . We 're praying . Your false god will not help you . - God helps all of us . - We 'll be quiet . We 'll be quiet . God ... helps ... all of us . Air lock ! This is your fault . This is all your fault . We should have moved when there was more of us ! I 'm so sick of people making bad decisions in God 's name . No , take him ! - We 're gonna die because of you ! - Let 's go ! Now ! Now ! That 's enough ! Enough . Enough . We 're done here . We 're done here . Everyone take your seats , please . I don 't understand . They were frakking with our heads . Probably shot dummies out the air lock , didn 't you ? This was your initial placement exercise . We needed to find out how you 'd function under stress , who would crumble , who would step up . That 's good work . We 'll be at the compound within the hour . I need you home . I can 't . Not yet . I 'm in a bad situation , and I don 't know if I can make it through without you . - What have you done ? - The less you know { * about it } , the better . How am I supposed to help if you won 't tell me ... I don 't know . I 'm not thinking clearly . I haven 't been sleeping . - I 'm losing it . - No , you 're not . That crazy confidence of yours is just the side you let everyone see . This side , what 's going on right now , this fear and this anxiety ? - That is always there { * . That is always } with you . - I don 't ... Yes , it is . It eats at you . You overcome it . And it gives you forward momentum . That 's how you work . Without that , I don 't think your little empire would exist . So I exploit my own fear to get what I want ? That 's your novel theory ? You exploit anything that isn 't nailed down . That 's my theory . The truth hurts , pal . No , it doesn 't . Where are you ? You heard they fished a floater from the Titaressos ? About 200 klicks from here ... Female , head , hands , feet removed . Medical examiner thinks that the woman recently gave birth . They 're gonna do a sweep of medical facilities , but I don 't think they 're gonna be able to match anything to records . Some people just don 't like hospitals , I guess . You hear from your CI ? Heard from Clarice Willow , though . She reported her wife missing . Apparently , there was a fight . Mar-beth stormed out . Clarice chalked it up to postpartum depression , but hasn 't seen or heard from her since . I had nothing to do with this . Mar-beth knew the risks . Anything else ? Keep me in the loop . We 're all in this together , sir . So did you have a chance to look around ? I did . I found my quarters . I found my bunk . - I found the cocktail party . - Excellent . You remember our friendly polly hijacker . Kevin Reikle , STO praetor . God , I 'm so sorry about ... beating you . No one 's ever gun-butted me before . It was impressive . We should all go in and eat . Tomorrow the hard work begins . It 's weird , huh ? Not bad , though . Odin ? Aren 't you hungry ? What ? Not sure . Look . They 're from the shuttle . What are they doing ? The ones that failed . Holy frak . Never forget who these people are ... And what they 're capable of .

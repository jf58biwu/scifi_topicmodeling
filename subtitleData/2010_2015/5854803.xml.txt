 I don 't mean to alarm you , but I think you may have a mold problem . That sink with the standing water seems especially concerning . Looking forward to it . You have the intel on you ? They know . They know ? We have three minutes , Agent Shaw . Hey ! Time to go , agents . - Exit ? - Follow me . I was wondering what you guys had been up to . - Go . - All right . - Um , where are the dogs ? - Don 't be ridiculous . I bet you 're usually the one holding something like this . Don 't worry . She knows what she 's doing . Whatever you do , don 't breathe . That was a joke . You should have cause for comfortable breathing if you need to . Just not through your nose . And very minimally through your mouth . Ah . There we are . That 's all the intel you recovered ? Ah . I certainly hope so . Well , thank you , Agent Shaw , for keeping it safe up there . We 'll push this through to the Hub . In fact , we 're headed there now to drop you off . Get you a change of clothes , proper meal . You 'll be good as new . The Hub ? Really ? How exciting . It 's been ages . Ah . Good , you 're done with that paranasal extraction nonsense . - Do you need me to analyze the data ? - That won 't be necessary . If it 's encrypted , I can mine the chip for him . I 'm afraid this mission 's classified . Clearance Level 8 . - Uh ... - Ah . Wait , what ? He can just shut us out of the process like that ? Well , he did say the mission is Level 8 . And we 're not . So we can 't know about it . Right , but this is normally the part where we all stand around the holocom and we learn about stuff . I mean , aren 't we all on the same team ? No need to get started on one of your socialist riffs . S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s whole infrastructure is based on the hierarchy and compartmentalization of intelligence . Every agent can 't have the intel on every mission . Makes the entire organization vulnerable . Okay fine , but if I just fought my way out of an underground Siberian prison , I 'd kind of want to know what for . Coulson 's got you used to the plane , the way we do missions here . The Hub is different . The Hub ? What 's the Hub ? Wow . I didn 't realize Big Brother was this big . Oh , this is nothing . Wait until you see the Triskelion . Everyone 's wearing the same suit . Someone tell me why , please ? Do I get one ? That 's your badge . Which means you 've got a long way to go to even make Level 1 . Copy that . Does it also mean no access to any computers here whatsoever ? I could run a search on the redacted S.H.I.E.L.D. file - on my parents . - Skye ... But it just seems like the place they 'd keep them , right ? I 'll look into it . But right now we 've got more pressing matters at hand . - Agent Sitwell . - Agent Coulson . Good to see you 're feeling better . Agent Hand 's waiting for you in the situation room . - She doesn 't like to wait . - So you know her ? Only her reputation . After you . Your Level 7s can join us in the briefing . Say cheese . Victoria Hand ... Is here . Ouch . Is this your subtle way of saying I can 't come with ? We 'll be back . We should probably head over to the Tech corridor . - Oh , I can 't wait to see the new chem kit ! - Yeah . I don 't think it likes me here . - Agent Hand . - Agent Coulson . Nice to finally put a face to the name . Likewise . These are Agents May and Ward . Well , now that we 've gotten that over with , here 's what you can know . The intel you recovered from Agent Shaw tells us that a separatist group from South Ossetia built a weapon called Izbutomiut . The Overkill Device ? A little dramatic for my taste . I imagine something was lost in translation . We 've intercepted chatter that tells us they plan to use the weapon in the next 24 hours to declare their independence from Russia and Georgia . We believe it creates sonic vibrations powerful enough to trigger weapons from a great distance . Anything from the missiles on a helicopter to a nuclear warhead sitting in its silo . So if we move on them , they could use our own weapons against us ? Exactly . That 's why I need a two-man team to sneak across the disputed border undetected , break into the separatist stronghold , and disable the weapon in the next 24 hours . And you have two people who fit my bill . Not a problem . I was in Georgia during the incursion in ' 08 . I still have contacts on the South Ossetian border . And you 'll have to use them . But we don 't have specs on the Device , so I need someone on the team who can identify and dismantle it on site . - Do you mean ... - I think she does . I found a localized EMP , plus a few other party favors . Oh , come on . What the ... Open . It 's stuck . The cart 's stuck . That 's unbelievable . What the hell ! Who designed this ? In the Hub , of all places . Oh , that 's ... Seriously ? I just can 't believe you 're going in . Dark . In hostile territory . Without comms . - Lacking any real physical strength ... - I 'll be fine . Did I give you an antivenin pack ? The Caucasus have a plethora of highly endemic spider species ... Jemma , stop . Stop worrying about me . I can do this . Thank you . And don 't you do anything rash while I 'm gone . Like jump out of an airplane . You 'll be careful ? Yeah , I 've handled worse . Oh , I almost forgot . I made you this . Your favorite sandwich . Prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella . - With your homemade pesto aioli ? - Just a hint . Hey , is this what you wanted ? Also , what is this ? Oh , Fitz . A full-sized mag pouch ? Just one of the many tactical decisions I 've had to make already . Hmm . And Ward said we needed it . You need to disable the Overkill Device by 0600 tomorrow in order to prevent the separatist attack . Once you signal S.H.I.E.L.D. , the extraction team will get you both out . - Take care of him . - Of course , sir . More moving , less talking , Agent Ward . Time 's not on our side . Does this feel okay to you ? Shouldn 't we be going with them ? The people who put these ops together are the best of the best . They know what they 're doing . So , Simmons , by this point , does not have a bloody clue . We 're in the back , trying to contain our laughter . So Simmons goes into the vacuum chamber wearing a bunny suit , but we just call it that because it covers your whole body . So , she 's in the vacuum chamber , but when she takes her mask off to speak to me , she sneezes all over the Faraday cup . Which is funny . - You have the beacon ? - Yeah . But it 's funny because vacuum chambers are so dry , and this instrument was actually supposed to go into space . It had sensitive chemical components . Simmons actually tells it a lot better than I do . Listen , my contact 's Uri Dubrovsky . We 'll pay him to get us across the border . We go back , but he doesn 't like new people . So keep your mouth shut and your head down . Um , can you ask what beers they have on tap ? - Uri 's your friend ? - Yeah . Uri 's dead . You have no friends here . Oh , no , no , no . Please be careful . Can you imagine what Fitz would do if the Night-Night gun was broken when he came back ? Surely he 'll be okay out there , right ? Well ... Agent May 's Level 7 , maybe she can give us an update on their mission . Does that mean that you do know something and you can 't tell us , or that you don 't know anything ? Which non-expression is this ? We know what we 're supposed to . When we have more information , we 'll react . All right , clear out . I need to run some diagnostics and reboot . That means you , too . Off . You guys may be okay with being in the dark , but I 'm not into it . I need answers . And I know just the person who has them . - Who ? - Coulson . I 'm obviously talking about Coulson . I 'm gonna need three more chalks queued up at the border . And a fourth standing by in Armenia ? Great minds . it must be nice to be off that plane . I understand you 're almost through your recovery . The plane has nothing to do with my recovery . I only know what I 've read . Seems Fury has a soft spot for his favorites . Not everyone gets sent to Tahiti . It 's a magical place . All I meant was , it must feel good to be back in the big leagues . Two of my agents are the key to this operation . I never left the bigs . Let 's hope they 're as good as you think they are . What 's happening ? Why haven 't they killed us yet ? I mean , I 'm glad that they haven 't killed us yet ... They 're waiting for their boss . So before he gets here , we need a plan . How long can you hold your breath underwater ? I don 't know . Are you familiar with the term " slam and cram " ? No . And I don 't think I want to be . How attached are you to your pinky ? Very , very attached . And before you ask another terrifyingly vague question , let me be clear . Any plan that involves even one of those scenarios isn 't going to work for me . As a matter of fact , I have a ... I heard you were looking for your friend , Uri . And Uri was friends with separatists . - Are you separatists ? - No . - We 're here to stop them . - Definitely here to stop them . Trust me . If you could just help us get across the border ... You 're wasting my time . So let me be clear . You 've given me no reason to trust you . And trust is everything to me . Hey , fancy seeing you here . Skye . I told you I 'd look into the file about your parents . No , I know . That 's not why I 'm here . I wanted to know more about Ward and Fitz 's mission . Simmons is seriously starting to unravel without Fitz . I know it 's hard to hear , but you don 't have the clearance . But I have eyes . I saw six squads in full tactical gear , three crates of RPGs , and a full crew of analysts heading into operations . Are you really telling me that has nothing to do with Ward and Fitz 's mission ? If I 'm right , give me a signal by not saying anything . Trust the system . How did it go ? Nothing . He 's acting like a robot version of himself right now . If we want the truth , we gotta get it ourselves . Okay . How would you suggest ... - Oh , wait . No . No . - Yes . No ! I can 't be a part of your bad girl shenanigans . I like following the rules , and doing what 's expected of me . It makes me feel nice . Simmons , wake up ! Ward and Fitz went on a top secret two-man operation . And look , there are more men . And either it 's a bigger deal and they 're not telling us , or something went wrong out there . And maybe there 's nothing we can do to help , but we gotta know if there is . What if they 're injured , or being tortured somewhere right now ? Fitz ? Tortured ? What exactly do you have in mind ? Okay , enough ! Okay . Little to the left , Vladimir . Gentle ! Gentle ! That 's it . Okay . Can I get a little more light down here , Marta ? Of course , mishka . Thank you , sweetheart . Little bear ? I like watching him work . That little bear . Okay . It 's nothing , really . I 'm just a man . Get this man a drink . Oh , no . Here we go . Yeah ! Oh . Salty . So ... Let 's talk business . Two million rubles ? We need to work on your negotiation skills . I thought they were like pesos . And anyway , you should be thanking me . I shorted the fuse box with my localized EMP when we were tied up . - Really ? - Yes . And my plan worked . Because we 're over the border now , aren 't we ? We 're stopping . Why are we stopping ? Quiet . Stay here , I 'll check it out . Okay , maybe we 'll both stay here . Fitz ! More border patrol . Already moving ! Hurry up ! Sorry . Am I disturbing you ? You know , I like this plane . I like the way we do things here . Everyone 's on the same page , no red tape . So far , it 's working for us . Most of us . And maybe I 'm getting soft , but I don 't like keeping things from our team . If you knew ... No , you 're right . Level 8 . But ... I know . Trust the system . May ? Thanks . Say cheese . Okay , you have the flash drive . Go . I programmed it with a decoy crawler . It 'll use my browser history to simulate my usual online activity , so while S.H.I.E.L.D. thinks I 'm trolling Reddit and Facebook with the laptop you gave me . You 'll be hacking the files for Ward and Fitz 's mission . Right . Remember , once you plug it in , you only have about ... Three minutes before S.H.I.E.L.D. catches on . Do you realize that you keep finishing my ... Your sentences . I know . I 'm sorry . Bad habit . This is actually a bit thrilling . Ah , good . I 'm glad . Now , we just gotta figure out a way to get the panel open . Don 't worry , made a special something . It 's what we do . All done . Really ? Wow . Okay , uh , now just find a USB port . - Okay . - Agent Simmons . It 's fine , just play it cool . Hello , Mr. Agent Sitwell , sir . May I help you ? Drainage pipe . We 'll wait ' em out over there . We can 't wait too long . If they use the Overkill Device , everyone on the border 's in danger . - I 'm aware . - And that includes Marta and Vlad . Oh , you 're on a first name basis now ? Yeah , well , I 'm just saying their lives are on the line , too . So let 's not get too comfortable . Call me Jasper . Um ... What brings you to this restricted hallway so late at night ? I could ask you the same thing . No . Don 't . Simmons , focus . Just make up an excuse . I was just on my way to the loo . I could swear it was two rights and a left , but is that it here ? That 's a wall panel . Why are you accessing it ? Don 't spiral . Just say something . Anything . You certainly have a gorgeous head , don 't you ? What ? I like men that are about my height , but heavier than me . Stop talking . Stop . Agent Simmons . Do you have authorization to access that panel ? Say yes . Say you do . - Of course . Of course . - Great . Yeah . I certainly have it right here in my bag . He 's onto me . Stop talking to me ! He can hear you ! Are you on comms with someone ? This is Agent Sitwell , I need an escort ... Aah ! Sorry . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Ha ! All right . Okay . Okay . I 've definitely shot Agent Sitwell . Good , good , good . Was that all right ? That was terrible . You are terrible at this . That was a total meltdown . The Night-Night gun was right there ... We need help . You need to go get May . May ? No ! Listen , that flash drive will only give me a few minutes of access to the Hub 's mainframe to find out what happened to our boys . So just go get May , okay ? Just tell her it was an accident . I 'm gonna be court-martialed . I hope this works . Why do you think S.H.I.E.L.D. sent in just the two of us ? I don 't know . They said they needed a guy like you and a guy like me . Mmm ... Is that a sandwich ? Simmons made it . My favorite . Prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella , with a hint of pesto aioli . Here , you can have half . What the hell ? There are dogs tracking us and you bring a prosciutto sandwich ? I can 't believe you just did that . This is a mission , not a picnic ! I 'm well aware it 's not a picnic , Mr. Save-the-day . What 's that supposed to mean ? Come on , you obviously get off on being the guy who always gets to throw the last punch , who always swoops in to save the girl . Now you 've destroyed the world 's most dangerous sandwich . Congratulations . I 'll tell you something , I don 't need to be rescued ... - Yeah . And I 'll have ... - Listen . Before we left , Coulson told me to take care of you . That is what I am doing . Nothing more , nothing less . Here . If you 're hungry , eat this . It 's odorless . All right , boys . Let 's find out where you really are . " Redacted documents . " Okay . There it is . If I could just access the raw file . Crap ! I don 't have the time . Oh , my God . No extraction ? What did I tell you ? You told me to trust the system . And the system sent Ward and Fitz in there to die . Good day to be a rat . I mean , there you are , minding your own business , spreading filth and disease , and scavenging for grub worms or rotten fruit , when lo and behold , you see it , a prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella sandwich . Fitz . With just a hint of pesto aioli . Quiet . Feel that ? A truck . It 's coming . Zip up the mag pouch . I told you I 'd get answers about your family . That 's not what I was looking for ! I was trying to find out what was happening with Ward and Fitz . That 's a classified operation . It 's a suicide mission . I saw it all . The troop placements , the aerial assault ? Once Ward and Fitz disable that Device , there 's going to be a huge attack on that compound , with no extraction plan , and you hid that from us . I didn 't hide anything from you . You don 't have the clearance to know that . Is that really what S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s all about ? Level 5s are more expendable than Level 8 ? Is that all we are ? Just a number to you ? Are you done ? I don 't know , am I ? If S.H.I.E.L.D. keeps a secret from you , it 's for a good reason . - So they can hold all the secrets ? - Don 't interrupt . You just hacked a Level 8 secure server , saw operational plans that you have no context for . If details get out , the whole operation could be compromised . Lives could be lost , Ward and Fitz among them . I know . Those are two people we care about . On the plane you 're always telling me to think outside the box . So I went off book 'cause I was trying to watch their backs . Our team can go off book because there is a book . A Hub . An organization watching our backs . You claim that you wanna be part of that . A S.H.I.E.L.D. agent . Do you ? Yes . Because someday , I may have to trust you with a secret , and I need to know that you can keep it . Can I ask you one question ? What ? Did you know there was no extraction plan for Ward and Fitz ? That 's classified . Okay . Go . Go . Shh ... GO , go ! - I 'll signal extraction . - Okay . Simmons calls it the magic window . You 'd probably guess , " Is that X-ray technology ? " There are actually S band microwave antennae embedded in this sheet . Works more like a radar system , really . Okay , let 's see . Okay . Okay , we have two guards on the west wall . Both carrying automatic weapons . Correction , make that three guards . We have three guards now . Oh , my God . Oh , my God , Ward , he 's attacking the others . He 's coming straight for us . Ward . Ward ? Hurry . Inside . Ahh ... That makes sense now . This must be it . Weird . Core must be inside here , that 's what 's important . The piping around it just serves to amplify and direct the sound . To trigger munitions from a distance . Doesn 't look like it could take a jet out of the sky . Well , you should know by now , Agent Ward , that looks can be deceiving . - Good ? - Yeah . This is gonna take a while . - You have 10 minutes . - I thought you 'd say five . Agent Sitwell is in the infirmary . Apparently , a member of your team rendered him unconscious . A misunderstanding . I 'll handle the matter internally . Tranquilizing an agent does not qualify as a misunderstanding . You 're right . But being told there 's an extraction team in place when in fact , there isn 't ? That does . I 'm Level 8 . I 'm entitled to information regarding the welfare of my team . You should 've told me . Seems I didn 't have to . And what would that have changed , Agent Coulson ? You yourself have designed dozens of operations like this . You know how this works . Usually with an extraction plan . Barton , Romanoff , they never have an extraction plan . They know that going in . Agent Fitz is unproven in the field . And knowing would 've caused him to lose focus or courage . That should 've been my call . I wasn 't sure you 'd comply . Your team includes an electronically tagged non-agent who is notorious for leaking secrets . Which reminds me , how did you get this information again ? I know what the safety of a thousand men is worth . I know the importance of taking the Overkill Device out of play . But I also know my men and what they 're worth ! The decision to go in should 've been theirs to make . Perhaps . But you need to trust the system , Agent Coulson . All right , show me the final steps to disable this thing . I 'll get it done . No , we stick to the extraction plan . I 'll be done in a minute . Extraction plan 's a bust . What ? Exfil team didn 't make contact . Once you take that thing apart , and I set off the remote beacon , we 're on our own . You should go . I 'm not leaving . - Fitz . There 's no time ... - You don 't think I can handle this ? - No , I am trying to protect you . - Ah , you think I 'm a coward . - Is that it ? - What ? No ! I am every bit the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent that you are . Whoa . You don 't have anything to prove . What you said about me always needing to swoop in ? I know you would 've jumped out of the plane to save Simmons . And she knows that , too . I 'm not trying to prove anything to anyone . Okay ? Before we left , you 're not the only one that Coulson talked to , okay ? He told me to take care of you , too . And that 's exactly what I 'm gonna do . I 'm not going anywhere . You understand ? And I 'm bloody starving . You got the information . Now we act . - We 're gonna get our guys . - Somebody has to . - What about the S.H.I.E.L.D. assault ? - We won 't interfere . You don 't need a battalion for an extraction . - Three can pull it off . - Four is better . You 're in ? Thought we all had to be Level 8 to discuss this ? We 're not discussing anything . Last chance , Fitz . Are you sure you don 't want a head start ? Because the second you pull that final wire ... Your turn . Beacon 's hot . The Device is disabled . Mission 's a go . Okay , Fitz , let 's go . We need to slip out of here before they notice the Device is powered down . Got it . - We need a new plan . - We need a new plan . - Are you sure this is gonna work ? - Yes . Theoretically . Hurry . Okay , finished . What was that ? S.H.I.E.L.D. They 've started their attack . Which means we don 't have much time before they crush the compound . Get up there and take out as many of their weapons as you can with that thing . Fitz ! Behind you ! - I just did that . - Yeah . Okay , let 's go . They said they needed a guy like me and a guy like you , right ? Right . It 's the extraction team ! Better . It 's The Cavalry . Never get tired of seeing that . Are Coulson 's people clear ? They are . I thought there wasn 't gonna be an extraction . All our resources were needed elsewhere . And it 's Agent Coulson 's team , they didn 't need one . Okay . Let 's mop up . Thanks for coming to get us , sir . We take care of our own . Well done , Fitz . So glad you 're all right . Yep . Good to see you , too . Oh ! The sandwich , how was it ? Too much aioli ? It was delicious . You know , for a second there , I thought I 'd have to find a new supervising officer . Sorry to disappoint . The truth is , I was in good hands . I had Ward 's back the whole time . Yeah . Pretty much saved him from a gang of Russian mobsters . And kicked a few guys ' heads in . But enough mission talk already . Anything exciting happen at the Hub ? I shot a superior officer in the chest . Hey . I was thinking about today , and I 'm really sorry ... I just wanted to let you know that I didn 't forget about what you asked me , back at the Hub . What do you mean ? The un-redacted file . About your past . I found it . Uh , What did it say ? The document wasn 't about you directly . It was about the person who dropped you off at the orphanage . Turns out it was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent . A S.H.I.E.L.D. agent ? Why ? I mean , who ? What does that mean ? The agent was unidentified . We don 't know if she was your mother or if she just found you on a doorstep . Mother ? it was a woman ? I put in a request to dig further into the files for any related materials . But right now , that 's all I have . I 'm sorry . Sorry ? Thank you . Thank you so much . - You finish reading it yet ? - Mmm . What 'd you tell her ? The truth . I told her a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent dropped her off at the orphanage . But you didn 't tell her why . I can 't . Some secrets are meant to stay secret . Will you help me find out what really happened ? Dangerous waters . But I can try . Thank you . Poor girl . Company . Yes , I need access to a restricted file . Bravo Charlie Yankee 3-0-7-6-0-4 . Authorization code . X-ray 2-8-9-6 . You 're looking for a death and recovery report , sir ? Yes , for a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent . Mostly interested in his recovery . It took place in Tahiti . I 'm sorry , but you don 't have access to that document , sir . There must be some mistake . I 'm Level 8 . I have clearance for that file . The system indicates that you don 't . Would you like me to submit a formal request to Director Fury , sir ? No . Thank you .

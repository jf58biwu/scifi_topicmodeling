Everyone 's , everyone 's gone . We 've gotta keep moving . The swarm is gonna be on us all night ... C 'mon . Remember when I found you ? I was the one who made you take the oath before you could join us , you remember that ? Say it . " One-one lives , all live " Right . OK ... And I promise ... I will never leave you but right now we have to go . C 'mon , let 's go . Hey , hey , Karina , look . Can 't find the keys . Got ' em . Good . Hey , check under the seat . In the glove compartment , in the console . and check for anything that we can - we can use . Oh Lord . Oh ! Oh my God . - What the hell ? Is ... - No . No , no . Just cut myself in the window of the truck after ... - Why didn 't you tell me earlier ? Because it wouldn 't help their situation at the time . Where 's the map ? Here , look . Check this out . Looks like he marked all the med stations all over the county . These closest ones are where we came from . The swarm might 've already past through . Hey , hey , I got you . I gotcha . How fast can you drive ? - I 'll get you there . I promise . Paul . C 'mon , hang in there . You gotta stay awake . Paul , you okay ? - Yeah . Just gimme the next ... gimme the next med station . I can 't feel my ... I can 't feel my hand . Hang in there . Please ... C 'mon , you promised you wouldn 't leave me . OK ? The next med station 's close , alright ? Please be in the area , please , please , please .. No ! No ! Help ! Help ! Are you a doctor ? - Yes . Doktor Markunis . Get up , c 'mon . Please help us . I 'm sorry I gave you a scare earlier . I try to keep this place locked down but with so many entrances and exits one or two managed to get in once in a while . No , it 's quite alright . You saved us . Thank you . How is he ? - He didn 't rupture any major organs or arteries , but he lost a lot of blood . - A precaution . It varies how quickly people turn and if it 's fast we need to be ready . Is he gonna die ? - People can recover from this . But with my limited resources all we can do now is wait . But I think we should be ready for anything . We had a camp outside Rockford . About 20 of us . I was gonna start calling it ... home . Yesterday a swarm came through during the night . Nobody heard anything until Angela was screaming . We were surrounded so fast . All our drills were for nothing against those numbers . Paul and I are the only ones . He 's all I have now . We found a car on the side of the road , thank God . Feels like we drove it halfway across the state . You 're the only place that wasn 't overrun . Oh , we were overrun . But it wasn 't them . But if it wasn 't the DKs , - who ? When it all began we were getting supplies every day and then suddenly , - it stopped . Patients didn 't , and then it all went to shit . Fights broke out . People were killing eachother . There was chaos everywhere . There was this young girl , about your age . An internist , Kate . Had these long eyelashes that were just so pretty . Seven of them came . Huh , all of them my patients . I 'd just stitched them up two days prior . We hid in a storage closet ... downstairs . But they found us . Grabbed her and left me . Too old , I guess . Yes , a lot of ... of bad things happened here . But those walking bodies had nothing to do with it . " DKs " , you call them ? - Yeah , like rotting , decay . That 's cute . But after all that happened here , you still stayed ? The only one . Been a few months . My oath is to people who need help . And that holds up now more than ever . Come , come . Let 's ... let 's take a walk . His body is shutting down . I can barely feel a pulse . No ... no ... - I 'm sorry . I have to take him away now . - No , no , please no ... - He doesn 't have the want to live . Do you wanna remember him as he is or do you wanna remember him when he comes back ? I 'll be right back . Hey , hey , sweetheart . I won 't leave you alone , but I have to take him away now . Okay , okay , I 'll be right back ... I killed a man . Early on . I shot him . It was in the woods . I-I thought he was a DK . I moved closer . I saw him choking on his own blood . Then ... this little girl came screaming from the trees . I just ran . I left her all alone . I knew I 'd be the last one . I knew it was my punishment to die scared and alone just like that little girl . " One lives , all live " . Heh . Yeah , sure . I get it . Honour your dead friends by never giving up . It 's a great toast . But here 's what they 'll never know , Actually being the last one ... What , am I just supposed to keep pressing on forever with only the memories of all my friends being torn apart to keep me warm and cosy ? If that 's all we 've been fighting for this whole time then screw this world . It 's too bad you can 't prescribe bullets . You only need one . I might be able to offer you another option . When Kate and I were huddled in that closet terrified with those men calling for her , she looked at me and her eyes said the same thing any patient asks " Help me " . And as they dragged her out I pushed a vial into her hand She knew what it was . I gave her a choice . Soon I realized I could offer help in another way No more violence . No more loss . No more pain . A release , - on your terms . Yes . Karina ... - Kar-Karina . - Oh my God ! No , no , no .. wait . You 're alive ? - What , what happened ? - She didn 't want to be alone . She thought you were dead . We thought you were dead . You killed , - you killed her ? Is that what you do here ? Those people in that room , they came here for your help . We came here for your help . You were out there killing each other for canned peaches or a safe spot to sleep at night . because YOU don 't think you have a choice THEY wanted an alternative . Karina wanted an alternative . - An alternative ? ! You have no right ... - I don 't need any right I am not making the decisions . Their minds are free now . Fear is a disease . It breaks us down and makes us turn on each other like cancer cells . Can 't you feel how vicious it is ? How palpable and infectious I offer freedom to those who realize the futility of fighting one another . Hope doesn 't mean the same , Paul . Not any more , not in this world . The only real hope we have is that maybe we get to choose how it ends . I 'm so sorry for everything that happened , but I didn 't make the decision , - Karina did . And I will be here for those who want that same choice . That is my oath . So now , it 's you who has a choice . You can 't murder someone who wants to die . If you think I 'm wrong , if you think I 'm a murderer , ... then stop me . In this world stripped of humanity and hope we have to fight to live . And you gave up , you thought everything was taken away from you but here I am ... She was right . It IS a choice . But you were wrong about 1 thing , - you were never alone . You gave up on me , - on all of us . But it still means something , - our oath . " One lives , all live " It means you 're coming with me . ~ Subs by His Grumpiness Elijah A. May ~

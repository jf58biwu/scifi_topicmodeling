 We will not betray you . We are of peace . Always . I 'm pleased the baby survived . The mother did not . You killed her , didn 't you ? Ryan Nichols has returned to Earth . What makes you think you can control him ? We have his child . Ryan has to make a choice , his daughter or us . - Do you remember anything ? - I remember nothing . Hello , Mother . Fifteen years . Fifteen years and not a single glimpse of you . Not since you put me down here . I had no choice . Your human skin was infecting you with emotion . Weakening you . So you had to seize power from me before your time . Tell everyone I was dead . Bury me down here like a dirty little secret . I did what I felt I had to do to protect our species . I never imagined that it would take so long . Take so long for what ? For you to admit that you felt human emotion . Don 't be ridiculous . Then why are you here ? Scientific curiosity . Our medical officers continue to work on isolating and eradicating human emotion . To no avail . You 've lived in your human skin twice as long as I have . You 've been down here stewing in emotion all this time . You want to know what I 've learned , don 't you ? When the humans set off the first atomic bomb it shone across the universe like a brilliant flare . Another potential home world for our species . So I came here and moved secretly among these people to see if interbreeding was possible . But then I realized that it would never work here . If you proceed with interbreeding you will have a generation of Vs who listen to emotions follow their hearts , and refuse to bow to their queen . I will have human emotion under control before interbreeding takes place . My plan will still take hold . Lisa 's just entering her cycle of fertility . So all rests on Lisa 's shoulders . You 're infertile . She 's the only one able to lay eggs . But she cannot do it here on Earth . I will make it work here . The next viable planet is too far away , isn 't it ? It 's Earth or nothing . Hey , Lisa . Joshua 's alive . They managed to heal him before he died . Oh , my God . Anna has him . Has she gotten any names out of him ? Not yet . He claims he doesn 't remember anything about killing the soldier eggs . He doesn 't even remember being a Fifth Column . I can 't tell if it 's an act to protect us . You have to find out what he remembers . Our names , our faces . And ... I need you to find out from him if he remembers any experimentation done on pregnant women as long as 18 , 20 years ago . - You were pregnant then . - Yeah . What does that mean about you ? Tyler ? - Hey , hon . - Hey . I missed you so I came to see you . Hey . Nice look , Ty . Yeah . I cut myself shaving . Well , you gotta stop using that bowie knife . - You wanna go ? - Sure . - Bye . Have fun . - Bye . I need you to analyze this blood sample . Hello . Don 't you people ever just say hello ? I 'm sorry , Sid . I 'm very glad that you 're onboard . You are an excellent resource . Soldiers are studly . Scientists are resources . I need to find out what they did to me . My son . You said blood samples could tell you if they messed with Tyler in utero . You have mine . Please take his . You sure you wanna go down this path ? If it were your kid , what would you do ? Thank you . There is no greater loss than a parent losing a child . Let the grace of God fall on Valerie Stevens her beloved parents , and her unborn baby . - Mr. And Mrs. Stevens ... - You did this to her . You did it . She had a heart condition . She should never have gotten pregnant . She should never have had to go to the Vs and their healing centers . I thought with their technology , that would be best . Look at you . You 're not even crying . Don 't you have a heart ? Don 't you have a soul ? - I 'm sorry for your loss . - Go . Just go . Ryan Nichols ? Anna wanted you to have this . To see your daughter . With Anna revealing Red Sky to be a gift to humans by and large , the Visitors are once again being embraced the world over . Healing Centers reopen this morning from Delhi to Nairobi . And as this line of participants in Manhattan attests people are again eager to take advantage of all Anna and the Visitors have to offer . You 're watching WNT . I 'm Chad Decker . We 'll be right back . A moment , Mr. Decker . I 'd like you to meet Eileen Rounick . She will be the first mother to have her baby delivered with V technology . I thought you 'd like to interview her to underscore the good works we hope to continue here on Earth . Happy to . - It 's nice to meet you , Eileen . - Oh . It 's pretty cool to see you in person . - I mean , I watch you all the time . - Thanks . Thirty seconds , Chad . So this is incredibly brave of you . - Heh . Brave ? - Yeah . I 've interviewed a few moms about having their babies born in there and no matter how good the technology is they 're still new to this , to human childbirth . So if something goes wrong ... Well , these moms just didn 't wanna risk their babies being the first . - You know ? - Really ? Chad , we 're just about ready . Here you go . I mean , you know some moms . Heh . There 's no talking to them when their kid 's safety 's at stake . - Yeah . - Five , four , three ... Forgive me , Father , for I have sinned . I remember you , my son . You stopped coming to services . Did you lose your faith ? Yes . With the Vs here , I didn 't know what to think , like so many others . Then the Red Sky came . And I wanted answers . And then I heard your sermons again , Father , on the Internet . And I found the answers I was seeking . I 'm pleased my words had an impact on you . You said that it was a war for our souls . Us versus the Vs . I wanna be sure , Father , that this is the right thing to do . I believe in my heart that the answer is yes . It 's time to fight . Then that gives me great peace . At 3 : 00 Greenwich Mean Time suicide bombers hit Healing and Peace Ambassador Centers on six continents . An international terrorist network . Hundreds of dead worldwide , 17 here including the bomber , an unknown male . Pulled this off a surveillance camera . Resolution 's crap , but it gives us an area code . - And the body ? - Head and limbs are blown off ... - ... but we recovered half a torso . - Oh . Lucky day . They 're attacking humans . Doesn 't really fit the Fifth Column m.o. They 're anti-V , not anti-human . The e-mail they sent claiming credit features a doctrine outlining their aims . Red Sky was the first volley in a battle against humanity . They 're willing to do anything to throw a wrench into the Visitors ' plans . - Well , what plans ? - Eat our brains , kidnap our young . Who the hell knows what kind of fantasies these whack jobs dream up ? One thing is clear , all they care about is blowing a hole in Anna 's agenda . - Twenty-nine holes . - The end justifies the means . Clearly Fifth Column 's not concerned with collateral damage . Looks like the timer reset . Pull out every stop . Find out who lit this fuse . Thank you , Agent Malik . The Queen will be pleased . The Fifth Column 's coordinated suicide bombings at Peace Ambassador Centers across the globe have left authorities ... Agent Malik delivered this from the crime scene . Once we run the reconstruction we should be able to lift a print and point her quickly to the bomber 's allies . Ahead of the FBI . I want them caught and brought to me . As they will be . This tactical escalation is troubling . Fifth Column is growing more aggressive . Twenty-nine bombings , Marcus . One in each of our cities . We 've never been attacked on this scale . It 's an international spectacle . Fifth Column is proving to be a bigger threat than anticipated . We have just the weapon to fight them . Ryan Nichols . One V ? The same V I sent to kill John May so many years ago . When it came to pursuing Fifth Column , there was no one like Ryan . Until he turned against us . He turned once , he can be turned again . He resisted your Bliss . What makes you think you can control him ? Because I have something more powerful than Bliss . Why are you putting skin on the baby ? To prey on Ryan 's loss . Every time he looks at his child , he will think of Valerie . I believe it 's hungry . She wants her mother . She has me . There 's no greater bond than a nurturing mother and her child . I can use this bond with her to help control him . Beautiful , isn 't she ? She even has her mother 's eyes . What the hell are you doing ? Why did you put skin on her ? I did it for you , Ryan . Don 't you want to be with your baby someday ? Even have her with you on Earth . Now , with the skin , it 's possible . If I do what ? All you have to do is help protect your own kind . Then you get everything you want . Don 't you wanna hold your daughter , Ryan ? When the timer goes down to zero , another one goes off . - In all 29 cities ? - No . The timer was set for each city . New York is the only one that reset . - We have to stop these people . - Stop them ? - We need to recruit them . - You condone this ? There 's no arguing it was effective . They wreaked havoc on Anna 's plans . Now , by killing a few humans , they could save millions . That 's good bang for the buck . We are talking about lives , Hobbes . This brought down serious heat on Fifth Column around the world , including us . Us ? We 're what ? We 're four people . We need an army and these guys have one . He 's right . It 's all over the news . They 're well-equipped , organized . They 're onto the Red Sky too , which means we gotta find out their sources . What they know . Now , we may not like their tactics but they 're a weapon . So the question is do you want that weapon in Anna 's hands or in ours ? They 're willing to kill humans to save humans . That 's crazy . We can 't win an all-out war against the Vs . - Not until we 're ready . You know this . - I 'm not saying they didn 't cross the line . They did . But if we could get to them , talk them into approaching this war our way ... They have a global network . Isn 't that what we want ? What we 've been after ? In the meantime , I 'm not letting them kill any more people . - Fair enough . - What do you got on the bomber ? Just this . It 's the librarian . Will Maybree . I took his confession this morning . He said ... He said I inspired him . - I didn 't understand . I didn 't ... - No . - I never thought he was planning on ... - Of course not . We know that . You can help here , Jack . We need to get his address . Somewhere in Hell 's Kitchen . It 'd be in the parish records . Good . Hobbes and I will head towards midtown . Ryan , go with Jack . Get the address ASAP . The FBI has that photo , they 're circulating it as we speak . We have a window , but it is shrinking fast . After this morning 's attacks we 've increased our efforts at identifying Fifth Column . I 've put Joshua in the Memory Chamber to see if he remembers his fellow traitors . Has there been any progress ? You seem concerned , Lisa . Of course I am , Mother . I wanna make sure we find the traitors before they can do anything else . Start with his last memories and work backward . His final act . If anyone helped him destroy my eggs , their face should appear . The last thing he remembers is his takedown at the hands of Erica Evans . It seems the experience wiped out all other recent memory . Including his recollections of Fifth Column . The last thing Joshua remembers is that he 's a devoted V. - Is the memory loss permanent ? - No . There 's a lot of damage , but there are memory fragments . - I 'll be able to reconstruct them . - Uncover who he was working with . I want those names . I wanna know who else betrayed me . You found Will Maybree 's address ? Yeah , I just sent it to Erica and Hobbes . Look , I have to get to the Healing Center . There 's a vigil at the site of the bombing . You okay , Jack ? - I was gonna ask you the same thing . - That bombing wasn 't your fault . How could it have been your fault ? Humans , they love guilt , don 't they ? They blame themselves , blame other people . When things go wrong , they just wallow in emotion . - And you 'd rather ... ? - Act . Yeah . Fight . Just ... Just do something . Look , Ryan , I know that Val 's funeral was this morning . And I get that anger is easier than grief . So you can get pissed off at what we 're dealing with and go after them . We can do that . And we will . But you can 't carry all this into that fight . - Yeah , how come I can 't ? - Lf you shut it out you 'll lose sight of what you 're really fighting for . There 's gotta be a clue here somewhere to what the bomber was doing . - Not your average librarian . - Toggle initiator . The backup . And this ? Three mil , static-resistant , high-impedance wire . - Signature of our Israeli friends . - Mossad . Yeah , clearly , a librarian didn 't make this bomb . We find our Israeli , we find our Fifth Column radicals . Something was tacked up here . Look at the holes . Like this . Okay . It 's targets . The Healing Center and The Apex Building . Every bomb went off at a Healing or Peace Ambassador Center . - What is so special about this building ? - Yeah . - What are you doing ? - Calling it in . People work there . We know the target . All we have to do is intercept these guys and make contact . If you make that call , a swarm of Feebs 'll scare them off . - We 'll lose our shot at this crew . - We make one mistake thousands of people die . We will find another way to track them down . Just like a woman . Why save time when you can take the scenic route ? I want allies as much as you do . But that is a building full of innocents . Now get your hand off my wrist . In times of danger , times of grief , of loss we can turn only to our essential humanity . What are we if we let go of that , if we lose the part of us that differentiates us ? We must be comforted by the light of God inside each of our souls . Let 's bow our heads in silence . I knew humans could be manipulated by their emotions but it 's also what gives them power , isn 't it ? No more games , Mother . You 'll tell me everything about human emotion and how to defeat it . You really wanna play games , Mother ? There 's plenty more immolation pills where that came from . All right . I 'll tell you . But first , there 's something I want . Keep moving , please . Move . We need you to exit the building . We got bomb squads sweeping every floor , but it 'll take 20 minutes to finish the evacuation and an hour to clear the building for explosives . I don 't have time . We need to find the target within the target . - Do you have a list of tenants ? - Just got it . - Are taking drastic precautions . These include heightened states of security body scanners and bomb-sniffing dogs . But will these measures be enough ? - WNT . Twelfth floor ? - Already been cleared . They 're working top-down . He 's Anna 's mouthpiece . He survived the first explosion . He 's the reason that the timer was reset . Chad Decker is the target . Sure . Why don 't you get set up inside ? I 'll be right there . Who do I make it out to ? Chad ! Down ! Get her other hand . Don 't move . - Let 's go ! - Move ! As you requested , Mother . I first heard this music on Earth . No , I didn 't hear it . I felt it . I carried it around in my head . For 15 years , it was my only companion . Tell me the key to human emotion . You 're listening to it , daughter . Heartache , pain , sorrow . I felt it all . And still , where it strikes me , it 's even deeper . Don 't just listen . Hear . Within it , such beauty . And yet it is cold . Sadness of soul . Is that what I 'm looking for ? What makes humans human ? The soul ? You said at the vigil that we need to turn to our essential humanity . To the light in our souls . Now , I have human skin , I feel . But I need you to tell me something . Do I have a soul ? Every creature can feel the grace of God . - I don 't . - You 're not letting yourself . My words have done so much damage , let me do some good . Let me help you mourn . How can I find comfort if I don 't have a soul ? Ryan , you do have a soul . - How do you know that ? - You wouldn 't feel this way if you didn 't . The soul is what lies beneath . It is the core of all humans . It is the wellspring of emotion . I always dismissed it as fantasy . It can 't be looked at solely with a scientific mind . It 's too complex . Nothing is too complex for our technology . I will isolate it in the medical bay . Not in a lab . Not there . It 's here . Where is it then ? A soul 's not a thing , Ryan . It can 't be found . It can 't be put in a test tube or a body . And it can never be destroyed . The soul is the single greatest threat to our species . If it 's there , I 'll find it and I 'll destroy it . Why is the bomb reconstruction from this morning 's attack taking so long ? It 's done but it was useless . It yielded no prints . But I found something of value . A fabric thread stuck in the bomb fragment . And you sourced it ? To a fabric produced at a particular factory in Singapore . Nine importers bought this in the past year . But only one operates on the East Coast . Five Brothers Textiles . Five Brothers . A code for Fifth Column . - Who is behind this company ? - Eli Cohn . Israeli descent , former Mossad agent . He owns small businesses hidden within shell corporations all over the world . Contact Agent Malik . Make sure she finds Mr. Cohn before the FBI does . And that she brings him directly to us . Melanie Singer . First we get a librarian , now we get a secretary . From Flushing . Let 's break her . You know , we don 't need three of us in there . Why don 't I peel out look into Singer 's background ? Go . After you , Evans . Do you ever wish you could go back in time , take things back , rewind ? Rethink things ? I had to take action against the Vs . You don 't understand what they 're up to . - Edify us . - Stopping me is not gonna solve anything . At dawn , that timer resets . Not if you tell us what we need to know now . If you think I 'm gonna tell you anything , you 're underestimating me . Melanie , a lot of people are scared of the Visitors . But if you don 't help us , your Fifth Column friends are in serious danger . The FBI is on edge , there are a lot of itchy trigger fingers . Now , I am the point man on this for the moment . And if you talk to us right now , I can get to your friends first . Maybe avoid a bloodbath . We need answers , Melanie . - Please help us . - I never met anyone . It was all done through chat rooms and stuff . When I was ready , they came to pick me up in a van blindfolded me brought me somewhere to give me the explosives . Do you remember anything about the trip ? The route , sounds , anything . I heard a lot of trucks . I think a barge whistle . Wherever it was , it may have been by the water . - Get on it . - Yeah . I 'll take her from here . About bloody time . I called my hook . I 've got a list of possible ex-Mossad with last-knowns in Manhattan . I have two dozen names . I was waiting for your FBI brain to help me narrow it down . Any of them by the water ? Right . There 's one of them . Eli Cohn . Owns a textile company right on the Hudson . I 'll meet you there . We 're a step ahead . - Shh . - Okay . - Whose blood is that ? - Your partner 's . - Malik ? - Yeah . - Did she see me ? - I don 't know . Okay . We gotta split . Ryan continues to resist me . You underestimated his resolve . No . He underestimated mine . Make it sick . Give it a chronic pain that only my Bliss can alleviate . No parent can stand by and watch while their child suffers . If he wants to be human I 'll make sure he suffers like a human . Ryan . Feel my warmth , Ryan . Ryan , what 's wrong ? Feel my comfort . No . - No . - It 's okay . Your baby is in terrible pain . I can ease her suffering as I can ease yours . Let me in , Ryan . - I can 't . - Let me fill your emptiness . - I can 't do this . No , I can 't do this ! - It 's okay , Ryan . The more I feel , the more Anna can hurt me . Just pray with me . The soul , it is a blessing . No . No , it 's also a curse . I can 't . No . Kendrick . Evans . Glad you 're here . Follow me . You 're not gonna believe this . Hey , sorry . I was across town . Right through here . Quite the fashion statement . Blank passports . High-quality work . China , New Zealand , Russia . Twenty-nine cities and now this . Just how widespread is this thing ? They 've got the models . The components . The paper operation . They 're shipping people internationally . This was ground zero . - Yeah ? - What was missing ? What ? At Maybree 's place . What was missing ? I don 't know . Not a good time . A car . I found that registration renewal but the garage was empty . He drove to the Healing Center . He left his car on a side street . I checked the last destinations in his nav system . All pretty normal-looking stuff . Except it saved a route to a place in Ossining . Text it to me . I 'll meet you . You got it . That was Tyler . He 's really freaked out with the bombing . I need to go home . CSU 's processing the scene . - We 'll call you if anything comes up . - Okay . I found this shipping label in the back . A farm in Ossining . Could be something . Okay . I 'll check it out . Malik . Go with her . I want both of you to check it out . Great . Forgive me , Father , for I have sinned . I failed to comfort a friend in need . And I used my words , the words of God , to inspire violence . The blood of innocents is on my hands . I need to know , where do I go from here ? Show me a sign . I thought I was a member of the Fifth Column now , not a target . I was almost killed today . Sources say the first bomber worshiped here . I 'm a priest , Chad . I gave a sermon . Never intended for anyone to take it that far . Yeah , well , we don 't always know the impact we 're gonna have , do we ? I think that FBI Agent Erica Evans is in danger . - I 'm not sure who you 're talking about . - I saw her here with you . She 's in danger . Evans ' partner . Last I checked , turning over evidence to the Vs is outside agency regs . Warn her . Or there 'll be more blood on your hands . So that was Tyler who called before ? Yeah . With everything going on , he 's been concerned about my safety . Mm . It is a dangerous job . - What were you doing across town ? - Sorry ? You told Kendrick you were across town before the warehouse . Oh . Right . I was checking Melanie Singer 's apartment for clues . Good . What did you find ? Nothing worth reporting . You know , a cop said that he saw someone looking a lot like you driving away from the warehouse just before he arrived . - Must have been mistaken . - Hmm . Pull over . Now . - Calm down . Calm down . - Pull over , Evans . You 're out of options here . Let me see her . As a hybrid , she contracted an unforeseen disease even our doctors have no answers for . She 's sick , Ryan . She 's in terrible pain . I can see you 're suffering too . I know you think you 've changed , but let me tell you you have no soul , Ryan . You will never have a soul . But you can have something better . You can receive my Bliss . As can your daughter . I can ease her suffering . I can ease your suffering . What do you want me to do ? All you have to do is join us again . You are one of us . Let me help you , Ryan . Let me help your daughter . Just don 't let her suffer . I 'll do what you want me to do . Get it out of here . Joshua , I reviewed your research into human emotion at length . After you turned Fifth Column it appears you sabotaged your results . I will begin anew immediately , my queen . What if I told you there was a source for human emotion , a repository ? The soul . Then I will devote myself to rooting it out so you can destroy it . My chief medical officer knows what to look for now . I will succeed where you failed . I wouldn 't be so sure , daughter . After all , you 're running out of time . Soon enough , you 'll lose control . And I promise you this : One day , you 'll feel the sting of your daughter 's betrayal as I have felt yours . Tick-tock , tick-tock .

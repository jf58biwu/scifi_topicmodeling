I 'm barely surviving back home . - I could use you . - I don 't need any charity , all right ? OK , fine . I need you . I don 't know anything about effects , man . - That 's bullshit . Come on , man . - That 's not bullshit . You got the eye and you know it . The computer is just a tool . I just ... I don 't know , OK ? I never saw myself out here . Where do you see yourself ? You got a five-year plan I don 't know about ? Look , it 's not about the money , OK ? It 's always about the money . What about Elaine ? I can 't handle everything . You gotta take care of that yourself . Terry , there 's a call for you upstairs . You think about it . Elaine . Come on . We 're supposed to be having fun . What 's the problem ? Just forget it , all right ? Look , Terry sprung this whole California thing on me today , all right ? - I had no idea . I didn 't come out ... - I 'm late . What do you mean , late ? Late . Oh . Sorry . - Since when ? - I don 't know . I 've been feeling sick all week , so I took a test and ... Why didn 't you tell me ? I wanted to . Believe me , I just ... I didn 't wanna ruin your trip . You didn 't ... Shit . Is that all you have to say ? What do you want me to say ? - I don 't think I 'm ready for this . - You 're not ready , Jarrod ? - What about me ? - It 's not ... Hey , will you get ... Is that what we have to look forward to ? Lainey ... Right ! Ready ! Here we go , here we go ! I think we 've got a live one ! Whoo ! We have a wiener ! That 's what I 'm talking about ! Whoo ! Oh , yeah ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Oh , my God ! No ! - God , no ! - No ! No ! Oh , my God ! Pardon me , ma 'am , but we 've received a few noise complaints . From who ? - The building 's half empty . - I understand that . But the other half is trying to sleep . So if you don 't mind , just ... - Fine . - OK . - Another one for the books . - Oh , yeah . Well , well , well . - Mm-mm . I call the couch . - Oh , come on . - There 's plenty of room for both of us . - I like my space . Whoa . All right . Beggars can 't be choosers . Good night . Earthquake ? Probably just a tremor . What the ... ? Turn off the lights . Ray . What are you doing ? Ray . What is that ? Ray ! Stay here . - What 's wrong ? - He 's gone ! Jarrod , no . Jarrod , no ! - Jarrod . Jarrod . No ! - What the hell 's going on ? Terry , please ! Terry , help ! What 's with you , man ? Jarrod . Oh , my God . Jarrod , Jarrod . - Jarrod ! - Please . What 's happening ? - Jarrod ? - Jarrod .

Please . Please . He went outside , to the light . And then he ... he just disappeared . Baby . Terry , please . Jarrod , look at me . What did you see , huh ? What did you see ? Careful . Jarrod , what happened ? I don 't know . I was being pulled towards this light . Hey , open the blinds . - No . - Open the blinds ! - No ! - God ! - There 's something down there . - What ? Jarrod , check this out . I don 't see anything . - There are people on the roof . - What are they doing ? I don 't know . - We should check it out . - You don 't know what 's out there . - Yeah , OK . - All right . I 'm calling the police . - I 'll try and get some pictures . - You can 't go out there . I can 't let him go out there alone . It just keeps ringing . A gun ? Really ? Just check the news and find out what the hell is going on . - Terry ... - We 'll be right back . - Jarrod . - Look at me . Let 's go . Hurry back . Stairs are this way . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . - Dammit , Walt . - What 's going on ? - We 're going to check it out . - What are you doing with a gun ? Get back in your apartment . Go . And keep it down . Hey ... You sure about this ? There 's been nothing new since 4 am . Denise , check the TV . It 's calm . Dammit , Jarrod . - You didn 't tell me to hold it open . - I thought it was common sense . I 'm sorry . Get down . What now ? Let 's get a better look . Hi , this is Jackie . Please leave a message . Mom , it 's me . Something 's happened ... Pick up . Please just ... Call me back as soon as you get this . Holy shit . I can 't see it . Is that what I think it is ? Oh , my God . - Just run . - What is it ? - Run ! - Go ! Come on , pull ! Back up ! Back up ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! Elaine , no ! Move . Move ! Come on . It 's OK . Baby , are you OK ? I feel like I 'm on fire . Come on , baby . I 'm here . Give me the ... Give it to me . It 'll pass in a few minutes . Look at me . Look at me . You looked too . How ? Oh , my God . All those people . - What do they want with them ? - I 'm not looking to find out . God , I can 't believe this . I mean , how ? Once you look at the light it grabs hold and it 's like ... It controls you . I mean , who wouldn 't wanna look at something so beautiful ? It 's kind of brilliant , actually . Enough of this shit . I got an idea . - Where are you going ? - Walt . - What for ? - I worry about him . - Terry ... - Everything 's under control . Are you OK ? - Yeah , it 's nothing . - Let me see . I said it 's nothing . All right . Walt . Yo , Walt . Walt . Walt . Are you in here ? - What the hell are you doing ? - Hiding . I saw the people in the sky like a goddamn rapture . Come on . We 're taking your car and we 're getting the hell out of here . Let 's go . I 'm not going out there . Get down . Get down . - Shh ! - Shut the dog up . Shut the dog up . Shh ! - No ! - No ! No ! Walt ! Did you hear that ? What 's up ? Talk to me . We 're getting on my boat and getting out of here . - What happened ? - They took Walt . They got Walt ? What are you talking about ? This one was different . It came in the building and it just snatched him . - Then we should just go . - Hold on a sec . Am I the only one who saw those photos ? That 's all happening right outside , right now . They 're everywhere . No , they 're not everywhere . They 're not over the water . That 's right . Yeah , well , it didn 't take ' em very long to find you on the roof . We can drive there in two minutes . You have no idea what they 're capable of . Elaine , I know you 're scared , OK ? We 're all scared . But I 'm not burying my head in the sand and hoping this goes away . - I 'm not saying that . - Just take it easy , man . - There 's nothing easy about this ! - I understand ... They 're in the fucking building ! - Terry ... - It 's the timer . Oh , my God . Shit . All right . Go , go , go ! Move ! Shh . - You 're disgusting . - What the hell 's the matter with you ? - We 'll talk about that later . - Yeah , we will talk about that . - Still wanna stay ? - I don 't want any of this . But it didn 't see us or hear us . - So if we stay here and stay quiet ... - For how long ? They 're taking people out there , plain and simple . The further we get out of the city , the better off we are . - He 's right . - Jarrod . If we get to the boat , we have a chance . - Yeah , but we don 't ... - We have to ... We have to try . Get your stuff . Pack food and water . Let 's do this . Let 's go . All right , come on . Look , the sooner I get there , the sooner the boat 's ready to go . Right here . - Hey . - Come on , let 's go . - What ... - What are you doing ? Driving . I know the way . Why don 't you take your slut ? Candice . Candice . Get in the car . Terry , I 'm sorry . - Hurry up . - What do you think I 'm doing ? - Hey , slow down . - No . Just stop . - You need any help ? - No , just go . We 're fine . - Yeah , but maybe he can help us . - Enough , all right ? I said we 're fine . Terry ! Terry , get up ! - Terry ! Terry ! - My God ! Terry ! I got you ! Jarrod , get your ass back in here now ! Drive ! Drive now ! - What are you doing ? - Get in the car . Come on ! Come on ! Open ! Oh , shit ! - Come on ! - Open ! God ! Come on . Open , you piece of shit ! Back up ! Back up ! Back up ! Go ! Oh , my God ! Help me ! Help me ! - Help me ! - This way ! Candice , where 's the key ? Candice , the key ! Turn the key ! Oh , my God . - You all right ? - I 'm OK . - Hm . - Oh , my God . - Oh , my God ! - Miss , we have to go . No , he ... He 's alive ! God ! Help me ! Come on , let 's go ! Oh , my God ! Go ! Go ! Make for the back door . Run ! Move ! Go ! Don 't stop ! Open the door ! - Get it open ! - Back up . Open it ! Come on ! - Where are we going ? - All the way to the top . - The safest place I could think of . - We were just up there . You wanna stay down here with that , be my guest . Go on . Let 's go . Come on , quickly , quickly , quickly . Jarrod ... I should have held onto him . Hey . Come help me with this . It 's better than nothing , right ? Yeah , if you say so . What are you doing , huh ? Like it or not , this is happening . You gotta be strong . Is everybody OK ? Are you hurt ? - No . - I 'm OK . - What now ? - We stay here . We keep watch . - And we pray that someone comes . - He 's right . Someone 's gonna come . This can 't go on forever . Right ? - Elaine ... - It 's best if we stay together . I can 't . The smoke . Given the circumstances , I think a smoke is more than reasonable . Candice ... I 'm pregnant , all right ? And I just thought that between all the stress ... It 's OK . I never even got to tell my mom . Come on , boss . Let 's let the girls get some sleep . You and I will keep watch . Both of us ? They try that light stuff , we got each other 's back . I hate LA . I haven 't seen a soul all night . Maybe the worst is over . Maybe not . What do you think those things really are ? I don 't know . Does it even matter ? It just doesn 't seems real . Well , it is real . You better wake up . - What 's that supposed to mean ? - The city 's a vacant lot . We need to survive . There 's not gonna be many of us left . Let me see . Somebody 's fighting back . - What are you doing ? - I wanna see what 's out there . Oh , my God . Turn that off . It 's too bright . - No . - We can 't risk it . Oh , my God . Did you sleep at all ? - Is it getting worse ? - What ? The marks on your skin . When I looked in that light , I couldn 't stand for ten minutes . Who knows what it did to us ? To our bodies . You remember that first moment when you saw it , when it completely took over ? Somehow you ... you still felt powerful . I still do . Why don 't you take a seat , relax ? All right , I 'll bite . What 's your plan , boss ? I know you 're dying to tell me . Nothing to say ? We 're sitting on the marina for Christ 's sakes . I 've noticed that . There are hundreds of boats right across the street . We 've been through all this . Remind us how that worked out last time . We go quietly this time . And search every boat till we find the key ? - If we have to . - Great plan , Jarrod . I can 't believe you 'd even suggest that after what happened . You make it sound like it was my fault . I was practically begging , but you wouldn 't listen . And you think Terry would have listened to me ? All right . Let 's say we make it out of the building , across the marina , down the dock , we even find the boat and everything . Then what ? - Then we get the hell out of Dodge . - Where to ? Carolina ? Down the coast ? - Anywhere is better than here . - How do you know ? We 're here . We 're alive . What was that ? What do you see ? Hallelujah . Come on , come on , come on . Everybody get down ! Jarrod ? Lainey ? It worked . I don 't believe it . Is it over ? It worked . It worked . - Do you mind ? - By all means , boss . Do you think there are more planes where they came from ? Yes . Now they know what to do , they 'll be sending help in no time . What ? - What is it ? - They 're not dead . They 're just really , really pissed off . Something is happening . We got to cover these windows . Come help me with this . - Get back over here ! - Look , I 'll find something . Here . Jarrod , what are you doing ? The only thing we can do . What 's this really about , huh ? Those things are coming for us . You think I haven 't noticed that mess under your shirt ? We stay here and hold up for good . I agree . Now he gets to decide everything ? We have no water , no power . Yeah , but you saw what 's out there . Yeah , and I would rather make a run for it than stay in a 20-storey target . Between those things and the radiation , we are dead up here . Go ! Go ! Go , go , go , go ! Cover the flanks ! Look . - Get off me ! - What do you think you 're doing ? - We have to let ' em know we 're here . - We 'll let everything know . You 've been saying to wait for help . Well , help is here . Does that look like a rescue chopper to you ? Don 't you get it ? We 're at war . Where are they going ? Those choppers are coming back for them . We have to go . Come on . We 'll get to the roof . They 'll pick us up . What if they don 't come back ? Look what happened to those planes . - What good is a helicopter ? - We have to take a chance . A chance ? They just nuked the city . And you wanna wave hello ? Seriously , you need to back off . We have to ... Oh , shit . You just gonna stand there ? What happens when the rest of the blinds fall ? We don 't have enough bed sheets . - Come on . - How can you be so sure ? Let 's just go . You 're in no condition to decide anything . Who knows what side you 're on ? I 'm warning you ... Stop it , both of you ! Look at his face . He 's sick . - Don 't make me hurt you . - Oh , don 't worry . I am not leaving here without my family . And there is nothing that you can do to stop us . Lainey , you have to trust me . It 's me . It 's still ... me . I know . We have to go . He 's gonna get her killed . Come on . Come on . All right , let 's go . You see anything ? Right there . - Hey ! Help ! - Help us ! - Don 't move ! - Don 't shoot ! No , no , wait ! We need help ! Please ! Oh , no , no ! No ! - Hey ! Yeah ! - Hey ! Hey ! Copy that . I 've got a visual right now . Mayday ! Mayday ! - Hang on ! We 're going down ! - No ! Oh , my God . Come on . Get off of me ! Get off ! Go ! Go ! Go ! The scaffolding . It 's the only way down . Come on , come on . Jarrod ! - Jarrod ! - Elaine , run ! Vaya con dios , you son of a bitch ! Help me ! Help me ! Help me ! Jarrod . Look at me . Look at me , Jarrod . Gotta get up . Come on . Come on . It 's our only chance . Lainey , please . You have to go . I 'm not going anywhere without you . Jarrod . My baby ! Jarrod .

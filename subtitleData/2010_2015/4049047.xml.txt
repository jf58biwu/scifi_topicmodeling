 Previously on V ... We will not betray you . We are of peace . Always . I 'm pleased the baby survived . The mother however , did not . You killed her , didn 't you ? Ryan Nichols has returned to earth . What makes you sure you can control him this time ? We have his child . At some point , Ryan 's gonna have to make a choice , his daughter or us . Joshua , do you remember anything ? I remember nothing . Hello , mother . 15 years . 15 years and not a single glimpse of you , not since you put me down here . I had no choice . Your human skin was infecting you with emotion , weakening you . So you had to seize power from me before your time , tell everyone I was dead , bury me down here like a dirty little secret . I did what I felt I had to do to protect our species . I never imagined that it would take so long . Take so long for what ? For you to admit that you felt human emotion . Don 't be ridiculous . Then why are you here ? Scientific curiosity . Our top medical officers continue to work on isolating and eradicating human emotion . To no avail . You 've lived in your human skin twice as long as I have . You 've been down here stewing in emotion all this time . And you want to know what I 've learned , don 't you ? When the humans set off the first atomic bomb , it shone across the universe like a brilliant flare . Another potential home world for our species . So I came here and moved secretly among these people , to see if interbreeding was possible . But then I realized that it would never work here . If you proceed with interbreeding . You will have a generation of V 's who listen to their emotions , follow their hearts , and refuse to bow to their queen . I will have human emotion under control before interbreeding takes place . My plan will still take hold . Lisa 's just entering her cycle of fertility . So all rests on Lisa 's shoulders ? You 're infertile . She is the only one able to lay eggs , but she cannot do it here on earth . I will make it work here . The next viable planet is too far away , isn 't it ? It 's earth or nothing . Hey , Lisa . Joshua 's alive . They managed to heal him before he died . Oh , my God . Anna has him . Has she gotten any names out of him ? Not yet . He ... he claims he doesn 't remember anything about killing the soldier eggs . He doesn 't even remember being in Fifth Column . I can 't tell if it 's an act to protect us or ... You have to find out what he remembers ... our names , our ... our faces ... and ... I need you to find out from him if he remembers any experimentation done on pregnant women as long as 18 , 20 years ago . You were pregnant then . Yeah . What does that mean about you ? Tyler ? Hey , hon . Hey . I missed you , so I came to see you . Hey . Nice look , Ty . Yeah , I cut myself shaving . Well , you gotta stop using that bowie knife . - You wanna go ? - Sure . - Bye . Have fun . - Bye . I need you to analyze this blood sample . Whoa . Don 't you people ever just say " hello " ? I 'm sorry , Sid . I am very glad that you 're on board . You are an excellent resource . Soldiers are studly . Scientists are resources . I need to find out what they did to me , my son . You said that if you had blood samples , you could figure out if they messed with Tyler in utero . You have mine . Please take his . Are you sure you wanna go down this path ? If it were your kid , what would you do ? Thank you . There is no greater loss than a parent losing a child . Let the grace of God fall on Valerie Stevens ... Her beloved parents , and her unborn baby . Mr. and Mrs. Stevens ... You did this to her . You did it . She had a heart condition . She should never have gotten pregnant . She should never have had to go to the V 's and their healing centers . I thought with their technology that that would be best . Look at you . You 're not even crying . Don 't you have a heart ? Don 't you have a soul ? I 'm sorry for your loss . Go ! Just go . Ryan Nichols ? Anna wanted you to have this ... To see your daughter . With Anna revealing red sky to be a gift to humans , by and large , the visitors are once again being embraced the world over . Healing centers reopen this morning from Delhi to Nairobi . And as this line of participants in Manhattan attest , people are once again eager to take advantage of all that Anna and the visitors have to offer . You 're watching WNT . I 'm Chad Decker . We 'll be right back . A moment , Mr. Decker ? - I 'd like you to meet Eileen Rounick . - Hello . She will be the first mother to have her baby delivered entirely with v technology . I thought you might like to interview her to underscore the good works we hope to continue here on earth . Happy to . It 's nice to meet you , Eileen . Oh . It 's pretty cool to see you in person . I mean , I watch you all the time . 30 seconds , Chad . So this is incredibly brave of you . Brave ? Yeah . I 've ... I 've interviewed a few moms-to-be about having their babies born in there , and ... and no matter how good the technology is , they 're still new to this , to ... to human childbirth . So if something goes wrong ... Well , these moms just didn 't wanna risk their babies being the first , you know ? - Really ? - Chad , we 're just about ready . Yeah . Here you go . All right . I mean , you know some moms . There 's just no talking to them when their kid 's safety 's at stake . Yeah . Five , four , three ... Forgive me , father , for I have sinned . I remember you , my son . You stopped coming to services . Did you lose your faith ? Yes . With the V 's here , I didn 't know what to think , like so many others . And the red sky came ... And I wanted answers . And then I ... Heard your sermons again , father , on the Internet . And I found the answers I was seeking . I 'm pleased my words had an impact on you . You said that it was a war for our souls , us versus the V 's . I want to be sure , father , that this is the right thing to do . I believe in my heart that the answer is " yes . " It 's time to fight . Then that gives me great peace . Look ! He 's got a bomb ! Sync by honeybunny At 3 : 00 Greenwich Mean Time , suicide bombers hit healing and peace ambassador centers on six continents . An international terrorist network . Hundreds of dead worldwide , 17 here , including the bomber , who 's an unknown male . We managed to pull this off a surveillance camera . Resolution 's for crap , - but at least it gives us an area code . - And the body ? Well , head and limbs are pretty much blown off , - but we recovered half the torso . - Oh , lucky day . They 're attacking humans . It doesn 't really fit the Fifth Column M.O. - They 're anti-V , not antihuman . - Well , the e-mail they sent claiming credit for the explosion features a nice little doctrine outlining their aims . They think red sky was the first volley in a battle against humanity , and they 're willing to do anything to throw a wrench in the visitors ' plans . Well , what plans ? Oh , eat our brains , kidnap our young . Who the hell knows what kind of fantasies these whack jobs dream up ? One thing that 's clear ... All they really care about is blowing a hole in Anna 's agenda . - 29 holes . - The end justifies the means . Clearly , Fifth Column 's not concerned with collateral damage . Looks like the timer reset . Pull out every stop . Find out who lit this fuse . Thank you , Agent Malik . The queen will be pleased . The Fifth Column 's coordinated suicide bombings at peace ambassador centers across the globe have left authorities in 29 cities ... Agent Malik delivered this from the crime scene . Once we run the reconstruction , we should be able to lift a print and point her quickly towards the bomber 's allies , - ahead of the FBI . - I want them caught and brought to me . As they will be . This tactical escalation is troubling . Fifth Column is growing more aggressive . 29 bombings , Marcus ... One in each of our cities . We 've never been attacked on this scale . It 's an international spectacle . Fifth Column is proving to be a bigger threat than anticipated . We have just the weapon to fight them ... Ryan Nichols . One V. The same V I sent to kill John may so many years ago . When it came to pursuing Fifth Column , - there was no one like Ryan . - Until he turned against us . - He turned once . He can be turned again . - He resisted your bliss . What makes you think you can control him ? Because I have something more powerful than bliss . Why are you putting skin on the baby ? To prey on Ryan 's loss . Every time he looks at this child , he will think of Valerie . I believe it 's hungry . She wants her mother . She has me . There 's no greater bond than a nurturing mother and her child . I can use this bond with her to help control him . Beautiful , isn 't she ? She even has her mother 's eyes . What the hell are you doing ? Why 'd you put skin on her ? I did it for you , Ryan . Don 't you wanna be with your baby someday ? Maybe even have her with you on earth ? Now with the skin , it 's possible . If I do what ? All you have to do is help protect your own kind . Then you get everything you want . Don 't you want to hold your daughter , Ryan ? When the timer goes down to zero , - another one goes off . - In all 29 cities ? No . The timer was set for each city , but New York is the only one that reset . - We have to stop these people . - Stop them ? We need to recruit them . You condone this ? There 's no arguing it was effective . They wreaked havoc on Anna 's plans . Now by killing a few humans , they could save millions . That 's pretty good bang for the buck . We are talking about lives , Hobbes . Not to mention , this brought down serious heat on fifth column all around the world , including us . Us ? We 're what , we 're ... we 're four people . We need an army , and these guys have one . He 's right . It 's all over the news . They 're well-equipped , they 're organized , they 're on to the red sky , too , which means we gotta find out their sources , what they know . Now we may not like their tactics , but they 're a weapon . So the question is ... Do you want that weapon in Anna 's hands or in ours ? They 're willing to kill humans to save humans . That 's crazy . We can 't win an all-out war against the V 's , not until we 're ready . You know this . I am not saying they didn 't cross the line , okay ? They did . But if we could get to them , talk them into approaching this war our way ... They have a global network . Isn 't that what we want ? What we 've been after ? In the meantime , I 'm not letting them kill any more people . Fair enough . - What do you got on the bomber ? - Just this . He 's a librarian ... Will Maybree . I took his confession this morning . He said ... He said I inspired him . I didn 't understand . I-I didn 't ... I didn 't ... No . I never thought he would ... was planning on killing ... Of course not . Of course you didn 't . We ... we know that . You can help here , Jack . We need to get his address . Somewhere in Hell 's Kitchen . It 'd be in the parish records . Okay . Hobbes and I will head towards midtown . - Ryan , go with Jack . - Mm-hmm . Get the address A.S.A.P. The FBI has that photo . They 're circulating it as we speak . We have a window , but it is shrinking fast . After this morning 's attacks , we 've increased our efforts at identifying Fifth Column . I 've put Joshua in the memory chamber to see if he remembers his fellow traitors . Has there been any progress ? You seem concerned , Lisa . Of course I am , mother . I want to make sure we find the traitors before they can do anything else . Start with his last memories and work backward ... his final act . If anyone helped him destroy my eggs , their face should appear . The last thing he remembers is his takedown at the hands of Erica Evans . It seems the near-death experience wiped out all other recent memory , included his recollections of Fifth Column . The last thing Joshua remembers is that he 's a devoted V. Is the memory loss permanent ? No . There 's a lot of damage , but there are memory fragments . Eventually , I 'll be able to reconstruct them . Uncover who he was working with . I want those names . I wanna know who else betrayed me . You found will Maybree 's address ? Yeah . I just sent it to Erica and Hobbes . Look , I have to , uh , to get to the healing center . There 's a vigil at the site of the bombing . You okay , Jack ? I was gonna ask you the same thing . You know that bombing wasn 't your fault . How could it have been your fault ? The humans , they ... they love guilt , don 't they ? They blame themselves , blame other people . When things go wrong , they just wallow in emotion . And you 'd rather ... Act , yeah . Fight . Just ... Just do something . Look , Ryan , I know that ... Val 's funeral was this morning , and I get that anger is easier than grief . So you can get all pissed off at what we 're dealing with and go after them . We can do that , and we will . But you can 't carry all this into that fight . - Yeah ? How come I can 't ? - Because if you shut it out , you 'll lose sight of what you 're really fighting for . There 's gotta be a clue here somewhere to what the bomber was doing . Not your average librarian . - Toggle initiator . - The backup . And this ? 3 mil , static-resistant , high-impedance wire . - Signature of our Israeli friends . - Mossad . Yeah , clearly , your librarian didn 't make this bomb . We find our Israeli , we find our Fifth Column radicals . Something was tacked up here . Look at the holes . Like this . Huh . Okay . Targets . The healing center and ... - The apex building ? - Every other bomb went off at a healing or peace ambassador center . What is so special about this building ? Yeah . - What are you doing ? - I 'm calling it in . - Thousands of people work there . - We know the target . All we have to do is position ourselves there , intercept these guys , and make contact . If you make that call , a swarm of feebs will scare ' em off . - We 'll lose our shot at this crew . - It is too risky . We make one mistake , thousands of people die . - We will find another way to track them down . - Just like a woman , eh ? Why save time when you can take the scenic route ? I want allies as much as you do , but that is a building full of innocents . Now get your hand off my wrist . In times of danger , times of grief ... of loss , we can turn only to our essential humanity . For what are we if we let go of that , if we lose sight of the part of us that differentiates us ? We must be comforted by the light of God inside each of our souls . Let 's bow our heads in silence . I always knew humans could be manipulated by their emotions . But it 's also what gives them power , isn 't it ? Uhh ! No more games , mother . You 'll tell me everything you know about human emotion and how to defeat it . You really wanna play games , mother ? 'Cause there 's plenty more immolation pills where that came from . All right . I 'll tell you . But first , there 's something I want . Keep moving , please . Move . We need you you exit the building . We got bomb squads sweeping every floor , but it 'll take at least 20 minutes to finish the evacuation and another hour to clear the building for explosives . No , I don 't have enough time for that . We need to find the target within the target . - Do you have a list of tenants ? - Just got it . ... Taking drastic precautions . These include heightened states of security , body scanning , and bomb-sniffing dogs . But will these additional security measures be ... - WNT . 12th floor ? - Already been cleared . - They 're working top down . - ... Worldwide scale . He 's Anna 's mouthpiece . He survived the first explosion . He 's the reason that the timer was reset . Chad Decker is the target . Sure . Why don 't you guys go set up inside ? I 'll be right there . Okay . Could you make it out to ... Chad ! Down ! Oh ! Oh ! Get her hand . Don 't move ! As you requested , mother . I first heard this music on earth . No , I didn 't hear it . I felt it . I carried it around in my head . For 15 years , it was my only companion . Tell me the key to human emotion . You 're listening to it , daughter . Heartache , pain , sorrow . I felt it all . And still , where it strikes me ... It 's even deeper . Don 't just listen . Hear . Within it , such beauty . And yet it is called " Sadness of Soul . " Is that what I 'm looking for ? What makes humans human ? The soul ? You said at the vigil that we need to turn to our essential humanity , to the light in our souls . Now I have human skin . I feel . But I need you to tell me something . Do I have a soul ? Every creature can feel the grace of God . I don 't . You 're not letting yourself . My words have done so much damage today . Let me do some good . Let me help you more . How can I find comfort if I don 't have a soul ? Ryan , you do have a soul . How do you know that ? Because you wouldn 't feel this way if you didn 't . The soul is what lies beneath . ♪ It is the core of all humans . It is the wellspring of emotion . I always dismissed it as fantasy . It can 't be looked at solely with a scientific mind . It 's too complex . Nothing is too complex for our technology . I will isolate it in the medical bay . Not in a lab . Not there . It 's here . Where is it , then ? The soul 's not a thing , Ryan . It can 't be found . It can 't be put in a test tube or a body . And it can never be destroyed . The soul is the single greatest threat to our species . If it 's there , I 'll find it , and I 'll destroy it . Why is the bomb reconstruction from this morning 's attack taking so long ? It 's done , but it was useless . It yielded no prints . But I found something of value ... a fabric thread stuck in the bomb fragment . - And you sourced it . - To a fabric produced at a particular factory in Singapore . Nine U.S. importers bought this in the past year , but only one operates on the east coast . Five Brothers Textiles . Five brothers . A code for Fifth Column . Who is behind this company ? Eli Cohn , Israeli descent , former Mossad agent . He owns many small businesses , cleverly hidden within shell corporations all over the world . Contact Agent Malik . Make sure she finds Mr. Cohn before the FBI does and that she brings him directly to us . Melanie Singer . First , we get a librarian . Now we got a secretary . From Flushing . Let 's break her . You know , we don 't need three of us in there . Why don 't I peel out , look into Singer 's background ? Go . After you , Evans . Did you ever wish you could go back in time , take things back ? Rewind , rethink things ? I had to take action against the V 's . You don 't understand what they 're up to . Edify us . Stopping me is not gonna solve anything . At dawn , that timer resets . Not if you tell us what we need to know ... Now . If you think I 'm gonna tell you anything , you 're underestimating me . Melanie , a lot of people are scared of the visitors . But if you don 't help us , your Fifth Column friends are in serious danger . The FBI is on edge . There are a lot of itchy trigger fingers . Now , I am the point man on this for the moment . And if you talk to us right now , I can get to your friends first ... Maybe avoid a bloodbath . We need answers , Melanie . Please help us . I never met anyone . It was all done through chat rooms and stuff . When I was ready , they came to pick me up in a van , blindfolded me , brought me somewhere to give me the explosives . Do you remember anything about the trip ? Um ... The route ? Uh , sounds ? Anything ? I heard a lot of trucks . I think a barge whistle . Wherever it was , it may have been by the water . Get on it . Yeah . I 'll take her from here . About bloody time . I called my hook . I 've got a list of possible ex-Mossad with last-knowns in Manhattan . Two dozen names . I was waiting for your FBI brain to help me narrow it down . Anything by the water ? Right , there 's one of them . Eli Cohn , owns a textile company right on the Hudson . I 'll meet you there . We 're a step ahead . Uhh ! Shh . Okay . Whose blood is that ? Your partner 's . - Malik ? - Yeah . Did she see me ? I don 't know . Okay . We gotta split . Yeah . Ryan continues to resist me . You underestimated his resolve . No . He underestimated mine . Make it sick . Give it a chronic pain that only my bliss can alleviate . No parent can stand by and watch while their child suffers . If he wants to be human , I 'll make sure he suffers like a human . Ryan ... Feel my warmth , Ryan . Ryan , what 's wrong ? Feel my comfort . No . No . It 's okay . Your baby is in terrible pain . I can ease her suffering , as I can ease yours . - Let me in , Ryan . - I can 't . - Let me fill your emptiness . - I can 't do this . - No , I can 't do this ! - It 's okay , Ryan . The more I feel , the more Anna can hurt me . Just pray with me . The soul ... it is a blessing . No . No , it 's also a curse . I can 't ... No . Kendrick . Evans . Glad you 're here . Follow me . You 're not gonna believe this . Hey , sorry . I was across town . Right through here . Quite the fashion statement . Blank passports . High-quality work . China , New Zealand , Russia . 29 cities and now this . So how widespread is this thing ? They 've got the models , the components , the paper operation . They 're shipping people internationally . This was ground zero . Yeah ? What was missing ? What ? At Maybree 's place ? What was missing ? Uh , I don 't know . This is not a good time . A car . I found that registration renewal , but the garage was empty . He drove to the healing center . He left his car on a side street . I checked out the last destinations on his nav system . All pretty normal-looking stuff . Except ... it saved the route to a place in Ossining . Text it to me . I 'll meet you there . You got it . That was Tyler . He 's really freaked out with the bombing . I need to go home . C.S.U. ' s processing the scene . I 'll call you if anything comes up . Okay . I found this shipping label in the back , to a farm in Ossining , of all places . Could be something . Okay . I 'll check it out . Malik , go with her . I want both of you to check it out . Great . Forgive me , father , for I have sinned . I failed to comfort a friend in need . And I used my words , the words of God , to inspire violence . The blood of innocents is on my hands . I need to know ... Where do I go from here ? Show me a sign . I thought I was a member of the Fifth Column now , not a target . I was almost killed today . Sources say the first bomber worshipped here . I 'm a priest , Chad . I gave a sermon . I never intended for anyone to take it that far . Yeah , well , we don 't always know the impact we 're gonna have , do we ? I think that FBI agent , Erica Evans , is in danger . I 'm not sure who you 're talking about . I saw her here , with you . She 's in danger . Evans ' partner . Last time I checked , turning over stolen evidence to the V 's is outside agency regs . Warn her ... Or there 'll be more blood on your hands . So that was Tyler who called before , huh ? Yeah . With everything that 's been going on , he 's been really concerned about my safety . Hmm . It is a dangerous job . What were you doing across town ? - Sorry ? - You told Kendrick you were across town before the warehouse . Oh . Right . I was ... Checking Melanie Singer 's apartment for clues . Well , good . What did you find ? Nothing worth reporting . You know , a cop said that he saw someone looking a lot like you driving away from the warehouse just before he arrived . Must have been mistaken . Hmm . Pull over . Now ! - Pull over , Evans . - Calm down . You 're out of options here . Let me see her . As a hybrid , she contracted an unforeseen disease that even our doctors have no answers for . She 's sick , Ryan . She 's in terrible pain . I can see you 're suffering , too . I know you think you 've changed . But let me tell you , you have no soul , Ryan . You will never have a soul . But you can have something better . You can receive my bliss , as can your daughter . I can ease her suffering . I can ease your suffering . What do you want me to do ? All you have to do is join us again . You were one of us . Let me help you , Ryan . Let me help your daughter . Just don 't let her suffer . I 'll do what you want me to do . Get it out of here . Joshua , I 've reviewed your research into human emotion at length . After you turned Fifth Column , it appears you sabotaged your results . I will begin anew immediately , my queen . What if I told you there was a source for human emotion ... a repository ? The soul . Then I will devote myself to rooting it out , so you can destroy it . ♪ My chief medical officer knows what to look for now . I will succeed where you failed . I wouldn 't be so sure , daughter . After all , you 're running out of time . Soon enough , you 'll lose control . And I promise you this ... One day , you 'll feel the sting of your daughter 's betrayal , as I have felt yours .

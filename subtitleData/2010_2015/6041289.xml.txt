 Whoo ! Did you guys hang out last night ? Yeah , dude . You should have been with us . We took a whole six-pack from Dylan 's dad . It was my idea . No way ! Did you guys , like , get drunk and stuff ? I don 't remember a thing . I blacked right out . - You only had a sip , you loser . - Oh ... Dill Pickle got scared . Don 't call me that , Lyle ! Rebecca , be careful ! We 're gonna get , like , a 12-pack this time . I had to be the lookout . I can 't drink when I 'm on the job . Like your dad 's gonna wake up ? - The bell rang , boys . - Whatever , Mr. Howard . It 's just all a joke to you guys , huh ? Let 's see how funny these test scores are . Honey , jump off ! Look at that girl ! Holy ... Dylan , please get back in your seat . - Dylan ? - Dylan , are you okay ? Dylan ! - Is he okay , Mr. Howard ? - I don 't know . Dylan , buddy . - What 's wrong with him , Bo ? - Dylan , wake up . Hey , Dylan . Oh , my God . Rebecca ! Rebecca , wake up ! Rebecca , honey ! Please wake up . IN YOUR EYES Subtitle : sync ; fix : titler Dylan , my man . You gotta get yourself some new porn . You want a beer ? I 'm on the clock . Where you been ? Out . Christ , boy . You cleaned the spark plugs of that fold-by with your goddamn tongue and you can 't sweep up in here every once in a while ? Hey , the only one comes around is you . Then you should make an effort . Where you been ? Carwash . Got an extra shift . - Bullshit . - Call ' em . - Think I won 't ? - Think you should . Have you been associating with any known criminals ? No , sir . I have not . Have you crossed over the state line at any time ? No , sir , I have not . How 's the job going ? Well , it 's boring , but it 's still mine . Two months . Gotta be some kind of record . Anything else you need to know ? I need to know when you 're gonna slip up and stick your pecker in the grits again . This may be a dumb question , but what did I ever do to you ? You went into other people 's houses and took things that didn 't belong to you , things that they worked long and hard for . And I paid my debt , Giddons . My conscience is shiny and new . Yeah , well , how about Bo and Lyle ? Bo and Lyle weren 't on that job . Hmm . So the record states . That is real sweet of you to take the hit for your old school buddies . All due respect , you 're not a detective . You 're my P.O. And I know that you ride me more than most . Why ? You 're smart . And ain 't nothin ' in this world dumber than a smart guy . A smart man , he sees beyond his little world and it kind of warps him . So when he makes that wrong move , and you will ... it tends to be messy . Well , maybe there 's a side of me you don 't see . Hmm . As long as you 're on parole , you are only what I see . Now , I 'd lock the doors if I was you . There 's burglars and thieves around these parts . I bet you thought I wasn 't gonna make it . Yeah . I wasn 't sure that I was . Oh yeah , that 's right , you 've only had 12 hours to change . You should have started last night . " Ha ha , " she said gamely . Well , two of our trustees are gonna be at the Thomasons ' . Do I have to be charming ? - No , just be yourself . - Ha ha . No , actually , you need to be a little charming . Just nod and smile and talk to the wives . It 's the Thomasons . Dorothy will be there . You can gossip behind our backs . I promise to turn my back as often as possible . Is that what you 're wearing ? Whoo ! Let 's go double or nothin ' ! I 'll spot you three balls this time . All tapped out , buddy . Come on , man . Don 't be a pussy . I know you got some green right there in that pocket . No . I 'm good . Hey . You walk out on a man who 's still gambling ' , you might catch a bad one , boy . You startin ' fights again , Dill ? Why don 't you rack ' em up , big guy ? I 'll be happy to take Dill 's cash off you . Come on , man . Let me buy you a beer . So what you been working on , man ? Just dirty cars , mostly . Yeah ? That sounds shitty . Better work 's comin ' . I know a lot of businesses going belly up in this economy . Tons of shit just sittin ' there just waitin ' to be picked . I know you could use the money . Especially if you ever want to play pool again . Ain 't exactly flush . Well , hell , let 's change that . Hey , can I get a beer here for my poor relation ? We 'll be seeing you . You know , if Giddons finds out that you and Bo have been chattin ' , he 's gonna send you right back up . Yeah , he probably will anyway . Boom ! With authority ! How does that feel ? Porters ! - Hey . - Hi . How are you ? Personally , I think you 're a shoe-in . I don 't know , guys . The city council would be a good step , but I still have a hospital to run , you know ? I 'm just ... I 'm not sure I 'm ready to move on . Methinks the man doth protest too much . - Stop it . - Not at all . He 's still got four months of protesting ahead of him . Wait until we start begging before you announce . Please don 't ever start begging . ... a rumor , sweetie . It 's an undeniable truth . It might as well be written in print . - What 's true ? - Chief Booth is having a thing . He 's taking lovers . - Just one , sweetie . - Paula Dodd . - Paula Dodd ? - Mm-hmm . Is she that ... she 's that ... Yeah , she runs that gift shop , sells those ceramic things . Oh , yes , thank you . She 's good . Someone should tell Audrey Booth . Oh , she would absolutely crucify him . But she has a right to know if her husband 's cheating on her . That 's all I 'm saying . Hey , Dylan . Hey , Donna . How are you ... You gonna buy me a drink ? Uh , yeah . Damn , I 'm all cleaned out right now . I mean I would . You can have mine . Oh . That 's okay . I don 't want your cooties . No , no , no . I 've been to a specialist about that and they turned out to be benign cooties . So ... Wait , what ? Nothin ' , it 's just a ... So , what 's been going on with you ? Oh , just , you know , the usual . Hey , you working ? Yeah , yeah . I 'm over at the , uh , National Car Wash , still . That 's cool . Yeah . Okay . Uh ... - Well , I 'll see you ... - Okay , let 's just talk later . - Okay . - Yeah , I 'll see you around . - All right - Okay . Good talking to you . Hey , Eddie . Ooh ! Yeah ! No , it 's the best thing in the world , really . I mean , I only took the class because Dorothy was taking it . And for the naked men . And for the naked men , of course . But now it 's really an obsession . The drawing , I mean . What about you , Becky ? Do you ever think about taking classes ? Oh , I 've wanted to take a painting class for a while , but I 'm really no good . Well , you 're not out to make a living , sweetie ! Drawing would be good for you . It clears out the cobwebs . Not that you have got any cobwebs . - Oh , my God . - I had a streak , boy ! You walked away when I was on a streak ! I had a streak ! Hey , you boy keep it light now . Let 's go talk . Come on ! Outside , come on ! - You all right ? - Yeah , I didn 't even see him comin ' . Well , he knocked the living piss out of you , man . - You okay ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . Well , let me pull you a beer on the house , how about it ? I 'll pass , Wayne , thanks . Phillip . Rebecca ! - Is she okay ? - I 'm sorry . I 'm fine . Oh , my God . Yeah , hit him again . You made your point , guys . You 're welcome . Give me a little warning next time you 're gonna have another seizure , okay ? I mean , honey , it really was quite a show . It was a muscle spasm . I guess . It hurt a lot . For a second , I felt like somebody hit me . The look on your face , Becky , was a little much , you know ? Even for someone with a muscle spasm . I just ... I guess for a second I was worried this was - the beginning of another ... - It 's not . It 's not . Okay . I 'll give you a shoulder rub when we get home . It doesn 't hurt anymore . # In our days we will live # Like our ghosts will live # Pitching glass at the cornfield crows # And folding ' clothes # And we 'll undress beside the ashes of the fire # Both our tender bellies wound in bailing wire # All the more a pair of underwater pearls # Than the oak tree and its resurrection fern # We 'll undress beside the ashes of the fire # Our tender bellies are wound around in bailing wire # All the more a pair of underwater pearls # Than the oak tree and its resurrection fern # Hello ? Where are you , asshole ? What ? What time is it ? Oh , shit ! # When we were younger # We thought everyone was on our side ... Oh , shit ! # Then we grew a little # And romanticized the time I saw # Flowers in your hair # It takes a boy to live # It takes a man to pretend he was there # Be in my eyes # Be in my heart # Be in my eyes # Ai , ay , ay , be in my heart # So now I think that I could # Love you back # And I hope it 's not too late # ' Cause you 're so attractive # And the way you move # I won 't close my eyes # Be in my eyes # Be in my heart # Hello . Hi . Anything in particular ? No , I 'm just stocking up . # Be in my eyes # Be in my heart # Look out ! Oh , fuck ! - Fuck ! - What ? What ?

I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry ? What am I sorry about ? What did I do ? - Who are you ? - I asked you that . I 'm looking at a store window . Am I looking at a store window ? Yes . I am . - Is ... are you me ? - No . No , no , no ! You 're in my head . You 're in my head . I 'm having ... I 'm losing ... Oh , God . I 'm so scared . - Where am I ? - What ? Where am I ? Uh , you 're on the road . You 're on a road . There 's a truck . I don 't understand . What does the truck mean ? Well , that means I have a truck . It 's my truck . I have a truck . You have a truck . Yeah . Why , what do you have ? What ? Oh , um , a Range Rover . Nice . Safe . I can see out there . I can see here , too . It 's like one 's close and one 's far away . I just focus and I can see what 's here or what 's in my head . This ain 't your head , lady . This is New Mexico . Wait , you 're real . You 're a real person . Oh , that 's the sweetest thing anybody 's said to me all day . I don 't understand this . It 's cold . Wait , are you cold there ? Yeah , it 's , um ... it 's almost winter . I can feel it . Oh , this is too crazy . And I can hear you like ... Like I hear myself . Where are you ? If you 're not in my head , then where are you ? - Exeter , New Hampshire . - New Hampshire ? Get outta here . Wait a minute . What time is it ? You know , what ... what day ? Um , it 's Thursday , the 24th . Okay , well , that 's today I think . Do you have a watch ? Yeah . Oh , my God . You 're in the future . You 're two hours in the future ! No , I 'm in a different time zone . Oh , yeah , right . Can you hear my thoughts ? I don 't know . Uh , think something . Okay . What should I think about ? I 'm not allowed to tell you . Right . Okay . Yeah , no . I got nothin ' . I 'm thinking about new sneakers . Okay , that 's a weird one . All right . Well hey , what if we just both ... Rebecca , you all right ? Hello ? You there ? Hi , Chief Booth . - You okay ? - Yes . I 'm fine . I 'm so sorry . I think I fell . - I think I 'm ... - Did you hurt yourself ? No , I think maybe I had bad clams or something . Um , are you ... how are you ? How 's Audrey ? Good . She 's great . Are you sure you 're all right ? Yeah , I 'm great . I 'm great . Maybe if you just walk me to my car to be sure . Absolutely . - You know ... - Where are you ? I think I 'm parked right over here . You sure you 're okay ? I 'm totally fine . Are you there ? Phew . Wow . Uh , guess we got disconnected . Yeah , someone came . I had to cut you off . So , wait . How ? I mean , I could feel you trying to come in , this kind of swimmy feeling in the back of my head . But I could stop it . That 's good to know . Yeah . Uh : I can 't talk here . People are staring at me . Right , and assuming I still got a job , I need to get to it . But , uh , I mean , we gotta talk about all this . Okay . Later , though . Um , 7 : 00 ? Okay . Well , wait , that 's 5 : 00 my time . I 'm still at work . Say 10 : 00 ? 8 : 00 for me ? Yeah , great . Fine , okay . Okay , uh , and if , you know , it doesn 't work for some reason , then , uh ... It was nice meeting you . Hey , it 's snowing . Hey , hey , hey ! On top ! Oh , my God , it 's almost 10 : 00 . Why , yes , it is . Is that some cause for excitement ? No , no , no , no . It 's just we ate so late . Yeah , I told you it was gonna be a long day . Yeah , I know . No , I was just ... I just meant ... I just meant you must be tired and thinking about going to bed . Well , I 'm not . Is that okay ? Of course . Good . Actually , um , there was a show I wanted to ... to watch . Oh , yeah , that sounds fun for you . Oh , my God ! Well . Yeah , hi . Oh , boy . I did not expect this to work . - I thought I was just ... - I know , I did , too . Oh , man . Okay . Well , uh , I spent all day just trying to think why this could be happening . So , did you come up with anything ? Well , you know , one thing did occur to me . Are you just by any chance ... Satan ? No . My name is Rebecca . That 's , uh , wow , I didn 't even think of that . I 'm Dylan . Dylan . That 's nice . This is a nice room . Uh , is this your place ? Uh , yeah , this is my house . I mean , it 's my husband 's . You 're ... oh , you 're married . Yeah , why not ? I mean , you got a name . You could be married , too . Did you tell him about it ? Um , no . I , uh ... I just wasn 't sure . Yeah , I mean ... maybe it 's better if you don 't right away . I don 't know . This is hard enough to believe if it 's happening to you . Yeah . I 'm gonna wait . Wait . So this is your house ? No . It 's ... yeah , yeah . It is , but , uh , it 's a little messy . It 's kind of the maid 's decade off . - Wait , what are you doing ? - I ... it 's better this way . You shouldn 't have to ... I don 't really have girls over too much . Oh , my God . I have to ask you . Did you , um ... did you get hit last night on the shoulder , like ... - like , really hard ? - Yeah , sure did . Yeah , son of a bitch just came at me with ... With a pool cue ! I know . I was there ! And I was also at this dinner party . ... the most impoverished patients among us with transformative healthcare trying to fend him off ! Becky ? Hi . Sorry , it 's Vicki Madden . I was just telling her about my smooth move last night . Oh . You must tell it really well . Yeah , what was that ? Oh , God , yes . The kids sound amazing . I can 't believe that . That was very smooth . Thank you , Vicky . So that was your husband ? Oh , yeah . Um , yeah , that 's Phillip . - Good-looking guy . - Yeah . Doctor . He runs the hospital here . Oh . Professional man . Yeah . I should probably go . Oh , well , do you want to talk again tomorrow ? Okay , but after Phillip goes to work . You 're not , like , planning on getting hit again , are you ? Well , let 's see . It 's not in my book . Ah , that wasn 't nothin ' anyway . Worst I ever took was ... Oh , my God . What ? Let me ask you something . Did you ever go sledding ? Did you ever go sledding and get really hurt ? I hit a tree . Jesus H. God ! I got knocked out cold . I mean I must have been out for more than a minute . I still have the scar . Dylan , that was 20 years ago . I 'll be damned . I got 12 stitches , and my mom never let me go sledding again . Not that I was all that keen to . Hey , what about when you were , like , I don 't know , maybe 16 . I mean , you were all torn up about something ' . I wanna say it was , like , the dead of summer . And it must have been a killer , because I must have been crossed out for a month . That is so embarrassing . - What ? - I can 't tell you . It 's too personal . Oh , come on ! You got to ! You owe me a whole July . That was ... Walter , my first boyfriend . I was so in love with him . He was 20 , you know ? I don 't know , we went out for like two months and then he broke up with me right after we ... you know . Oh . Oh ! No wonder . Yeah . I mean , like , right after . What a dick . Sorry if I , uh , ruined your summer . No , it 's cool . I was pretty used to having weird moods and stuff I couldn 't really explain . Yeah , me , too . I pretty much thought that you were PMS . Yeah , a lot of people get us mixed up . I remember some other stuff , too . But I don 't know , I guess it 's all kind of personal . Like , your mom . - Yeah , that figures . - You were in college , right ? Yeah . She wasn 't ever very well . She was ... like me , kind of . I 'm not much of a physical specimen . Dylan , there 's something ... it didn 't make any sense to me at the time , but , you know , I always felt like there was someone with me . You know , just like a feeling . I felt it , um , more strongly than ever after she died . It helped . - Did you ever feel that way ? - Why don 't you tell me ? I remember your first night in prison . Oh , yeah . Right . Time to come clean . - What did you do ? - I just ... Good with locks . Not that good with silent alarms . Got two years . In with mostly lifers . Yeah , I figured that was nightmares . - It was really terrifying . - Yeah . Yeah , I never felt as alone as I did in there , doing my bid . You weren 't . Hey ! - Jesus , hey . - What ? Go look in the mirror . - What ? - Come on ! I don 't even hardly know what you look like , except mostly your hands . Umm , um ... Go on , show me ! I ... you know , why don 't you do that ? 'Cause ! - I asked first . - Well ... I 'm not doing it unless you do it , too . Okay , but after you . I 'm not even dressed . Well , come on . Who 's fault is that , lazy bones ? Let 's go . Fine . This is ridiculous . I 'm scared . Ah , come on . What have you got to be scared of ? Shut up . You 're scared , too ! Okay , I 'm going to the mirror , now . God , I 'm beautiful . Oh , don 't be stupid . Yeah , no . When I said beautiful , I meant ugly . Wart-covered , right ? What did I say ? Just don 't flatter me because I spent the night in prison with you . What are you talking about ? Hey , look . I was having fun being a beautiful girl there . I was all ready to go buy hats or something . - Go back . - No . No , it 's your turn . Hold on . Just give me a second . It 's your turn . Read ' em and weep . You 've got such a nice face . Nice , huh ? Oh , no . I mean , yeah , it is . Well , it ain 't much , but it does cover my unsightly skull . So that 's a plus . - Hi . - Hi . No , no . No , it was nothing like that . We , um ... we actually met when he ... when he lectured at my school . I know , it sounds terrible , but it was really nice . - We just got along great , and ... - What did you say ? Oh , nothing , I was ... the phone . Uh , did you figure it out ? I wish I could describe it better . It was like a chugging noise . Yeah , I know . What it is , is you got a crack in your manifold . They go on you . You need to replace it . Let me check my stock , and probably rack you up today , huh ? Yeah , that 's great . - Excellent . - Thank you . What year is your truck ? Oh , uh , a 2010 . There 's no way the exhaust system on a Range Rover would go after just a few years . Here , turn her over . Okay , now go look under the hood . Like , what , now ? No , after he charges you $ 1,200 bucks . Yeah , come on . Okay . What am I looking at ? Okay , that sounds like it could just be the sensor got loose , so that should be over by the AVS . I don 't know what that is . Uh , that ... that boxy thing there . - Okay , over here ? - Mmm , no . Okay , try the other side . Over here ? Uh , it 's , like , a multi-prong thing . You 're looking for like a multi-prong plug-in thing . See that ? Yeah . Yeah , that 's it . - What do I do with it ? - There , look , it 's loose ! Plug it in . There 's your problem , right there . - The sound stopped ! - Yup . - That 's it ? - That 's it . - I fixed it ! - Yes , you did , darling . Hey , we 're in luck . I can take you today . We are in luck . The intake and exhaust manifolds were both fine . The , um ... uh ... - Sensor . - Sensor just needed tightening . I don 't think that 's gonna do you much good in the long run , but , yeah , I can take care of it for you . No , that 's all right . I already did it . Thanks , Dan ! And they put me in prison . # I 've been looking for a fight # All the trouble that I know # Trying to lose the world inside # But it 's got no place to go # Oh , I 'm armed and dangerous # And I 'm deafened by the fray # Waiting for the day ... # What is that ? # And I set it on this way ... # No , never . # Oh , take me home # Let me go all day # Just be here till I know # Till I know that the riot 's gone # The riot 's gone away # Turn it up , turn it up , gonna get fucked up # I wanna make up now # For all the things I said that I can 't control # Cut it out , cut it out when it doesn 't go # So one day we wake up # So while we wish to go - # We can zip and go now - # Oh , take me home # Let me go all day # Just be there till I know # Till I know that the riot 's gone # The riot 's gone away # Hey , I heard it for a moment now # Hey , I hear you coming and be quiet # Hey , I heard it for a moment # Now the riot 's gone , the riot 's gone . # Kershaw , so how 's the auto cleansing business treating you ? Actually , I 've been thinking about looking for some new work . Who with ? Bo ? Lyle ? I wanna see if I can 't scare up something better . I mean , I ain 't gonna quit or nothin ' until I 'm sure , but ... What 's with you ? - You got a funny look . - What ? You look like you 're about to kiss me . Well , I mean , when the light hits you like that , something about your head ... Well , solicitation is a crime , so what 's going on , Kershaw ? Nothing 's going on ! For such a smart man , you are a piss poor liar . I met someone . Well , there it is . Yeah . You 're getting your pecker waxed , huh ? She know you a con ? She doesn 't seem to mind . Oh , you got you one of them classy women . You 'd be surprised . Nothing you do could surprise me . Over there . I like that you told him you had a girlfriend . Yeah , well , some people will believe anything . Come on , you 've had girlfriends . Nothing that lasted more than a few dates . I 'm just not good with women . - What about your man needs ? - Becky ! You got a mind like a sewer . Rebecca . Shoot . Just move the other six back and then you can move that one over . No , dummy , that 's cheating . It 's not cheating . It 's creative . It 's no fun to cheat . It 's no fun if you win . Only reason you don 't cheat is ' cause you 're afraid someone will get mad . Can 't always do what you 're told , darling . Spoken like a true convict . - I 'm sorry . - What ? No , no . It 's ... yeah , it 's okay . I got no right to be touchy . It 's all true . Oh . Hey , uh ... I think I figured it out . You know , why it happened or why we opened it up when we did . - Really ? - Really . - Why ? - Why not ? What up , Dill Pickle ? Uh , I gotta go , Becky . Got something I gotta do . Okay , I 'll see you . Grumman Tech Supply . - The bitch is ripe , Dylan . - Is it ? You know our cousin Adam , the one who beat that aggravated assault charge against that 7-Eleven clerk ? Kicked his lard ass all up and down the freezer section . He 's been working maintenance in the office park . He says Grumman is empty as church service on a Super Bowl Sunday . Here 's the best part ... no silent alarms . Don 't it just make your heart sing ? I don 't know . I mean , you know Giddons is just drooling for me to make a move like this . Don 't worry about Giddons . He 'll sleep through it . Your end is two hours at most . You open up the pearly gates , we handle the rest . You don 't want to be seen with us . Yeah , I get it . I get it , man . Hell , we 'll mail you your cut . I could use some walking around money . Yeah , but this is more than just walking around money . We got a fence lined up in Wilburfield . He 's gonna buy the whole lot . Your parole gets through , this is you setting up in a new town . Like a proper man . All you gotta do is keep your pretty trap shut , Dill Pickle . Who 's ever gonna know ? I don 't know . I just ... ain 't exactly good timing for me . What else are you gonna do , man ? You just gonna wax a bunch of Caddies ? Dylan , this was your idea . When you got out , you asked for some action , something to get back on your feet , something safe . Now , this is way the hell out in Bedlow . And all that equipment 's just sitting there . It ain 't nobody 's . It 's gonna rust . There 's no victim here . Yeah , just a true convict . Dylan , we let you in on this because you asked . Now , I don 't like you knowing if you don 't have a stake in it . We 'll be waiting on you , boy . Catch you soon , Dill Pickle . - Hey . - Oh ! Phillip . - You startled me . - Sorry . You know how I get in these places . Yeah , I do , which is why I 'm surprised to see you here . - Is everything all right ? - Yeah , everything 's fine . I was around and I had a wild notion you might be free for lunch . - Uh , um ... - It was a pretty wild notion . Look , I 've still got my doctor 's cap on , I 'm afraid . Maynard 's here to discuss his research program . - Oh , the schizophrenic-narco ... - Narcotherapy . It 's a big word , huh ? Oh , which reminds me , next Thursday 's the big fundraiser , so don 't put us down for anything . - Okay . - Okay , good . - Excuse me . - Oh , I 'm sorry . - Dennis ! - Phillip ! You remember my wife Becky ? - Oh , yes . Nice to see you again . - Dr. Maynard . - Do you two have plans ? - Oh , no . Um ... I just need to remember to call ahead first if I 'm going to be spontaneous . I see . Okay , I 'll just leave you guys , then . Okay , I ... I shouldn 't be late for dinner . Okay , and I 'll see you Thursday at the fundraiser . I look forward to it . It 's hard to tell right off . Yeah , I wish you could have spent more time with her . I didn 't know she was coming . Well , I see what you 're talking about . Her body language is very protective , very concealing . She 's deeply uncomfortable . - It 's odd . - She 's always been skittish . I just ... I don 't know . Wait , wait , who 's this guy ? That 's Muffler Mike . His muffler 's been busted for about eight years , so everyone knows when he 's coming . And that is Bob Griese . We call him , yup , Greasy Bob . Okay , so it 's not brilliant , but ... Yeah . Ahem , I actually worked with him once on a highway job . He 's got a real interesting smell . Uh ... You got a problem , buddy ? Tell him to go fuck himself . - No . Nope , nope . - Go fuck yourself , dude ! - No problem at all . We 're cool . - Such a wimp ! What , you like it when we get hit ? Hey , who 's that ? She 's hot . Yeah , that 's Donna . She 's a nice girl . She 's a nice girl ? Is she married ? - Is she covered in sores ? - Not to hear it . - Wait , she 's waving ! - I know . You guys are friends ? Ask her out ! - I 'm not gonna just ask her ... - No , don 't be a wuss . - You know you want her . - Shut up . Look , she 's coming over ! What is this strange power you have over women ? If you don 't shut up , I 'm gonna shut you out . You 'd better not , not when our girlfriend 's here . Hey , Dylan . Come to me , wench ! - Hey , Donna . - Hey . Are you , uh , here alone ? Oh , Jenny 's supposed to be coming , but ... Haven 't seen you around much lately . Haven 't been around . Duh ! Say you like her shoes . Uh , I like your shoes . They ... they 're ... they work . I can 't believe you noticed them . I got ' em on sale . They pretty much go with everything , you know . See ? You compliment them on something they did or bought , not like their eyes or something they were born with . That 's how they know that you like them . You like their tastes , you like this ... - Shut up ! - Hmm ? Oh , I just hate this song . You 're joking . This is , like , my favorite song . Oh , I know , I 've heard it just so many times . Oh , yeah , that 's true . They do play it a lot . Ask her out ! Ask her out ! Ask her out ! Say , Donna , I was thinking , uh ... are you ... are you busy Tuesday night ? I 'm busy most nights . Oh . What did you have in mind ? Oh , I just thought that , uh ... I could cook for you ! I could cook for you ! I could cook you dinner . - You cook ? - Yeah , I mean , well , a thing or two . What do you like ? Well , I like steaks , big steaks . All right . All right , yeah . I could , uh ...

Phillip and I have a fundraiser Thursday night , you dope ! Yeah , what , you think I want you coming on my date , telling me how to kiss and stuff ? Who made you ask her out ? You couldn 't even talk to her . You 're nothing without me . You 're still not coming . I made you and I can break you . This event is going to be so great for our narcotherapy project . A charity donation is just like any other investment . You want to know your money is being put to good use . Well , you know , I can 't think of a better place to put your money than in the research fund . Well , of course you can 't . Your husband 's on the board ! But , no , you 're right . Sick people are always the best . Real lump in the throat stuff , these hospital charities . Give me cripples every time . Oh , these are psychos , not cripples . But , you know ... would you mind excusing me just a minute ? How 's it going ? - What ? - How 's it going ? Oh , I 'm fine . Yeah . Why ? What do you want ? Nothing . I 'm just checking in , seeing how it 's going . Yeah , everything 's great . Your sauce is burning . This is nuts . I haven 't cooked anything that didn 't take microwave instructions since ever . Here , smell this . What is that , rosemary ? - Yeah . Too much ? - No , no . It 's a little thick , though . Hey , you said it 's supposed to be thick . Well , yeah , but just maybe not , like , thick as a brick . What ? - Oh , you hate this shirt . - No , it 's ... Oh , this is the wrong shirt . Women everywhere revile this shirt . Dylan , maintain . The tie 's a little rodeo , but it 's gonna be okay . Yeah , easy for you to say . How 's your money dinner ? Ugh , you know , Stuffed Shirts Anonymous . I just have to worry about not falling asleep . Shit ! Hey , you 're gonna be great ! - Good luck ! - Thanks ! - Hi . - How you doing ? Good . How are you ? Welcome to ... oh , shit ! Hold on . Okay ! Everything ... no , that 's good . Yeah , that would be great , yeah . - Come on in . - Okay . - Never seen your place before . - You haven 't ? I thought ... you weren 't out here for the Fourth ? - I don 't think so . - Oh , I thought you were . Yeah . I had a barbecue . It 's kind of my own concept . Barbecue on the Fourth of July . Lots of people do that . Uh ... I , uh ... oh , I really like your shoes . You got a thing for feet ? Dated a guy like that once . Real weirdo . No , no , I don 't . Would you like ... could I get you something to drink ? I did pick up some red wine , if you like . Oh , you got a beer ? Oh , yeah . Yeah , definitely . I 'll take one of those , actually . - Here you go . - Thanks . It 's a twist , yeah . Cheers . Cheers . So , you really cook and everything ? Now and then . Ew . What 's this ? It 's the sauce . That smells kinda crazy . Ugh . Bimbo . Well , it 's not for tonight . Okay . Yeah . I don 't like my steaks all fancy . Just burnt black with tons of ketchup . - Mmm . - Figures . Figures what ? Sorry ? I thought you had spoken . Oh , gosh . Maybe I did . I think I was ... whoa ! Shoot ! Oh , no ! Hot ! Hot ! Hot ! - Shoot ! Oh ! - In the sink ! - Put it in the sink ! - God damn ! In the sink ! In the sink ! Oh , shit ! - There . Happy now ? - Me ? Maybe you 'd better go wash that off , honey . Stay out of this , Phil . Oh , God . I 'm so sorry . Uh , yeah , why don 't you go to the bathroom ? - Collect yourself . - I 'm so sorry . - You 're right , honey . - Just ... yeah . It 's okay . It 's okay . - You guys okay ? - Yeah , yeah . Did you get anything on you ? No , I 'm fine . But is she all right ? Yeah , she 's fine . She 's fine . Thank you . Who 's Phil ? Just give me a second . Okay . What did you think you were doing ? I told you not to come along anyway . I had everything under control . You had everything on fire ! Yeah , well , that 's the way I like it . Sure , burnt black , tons of ketchup . It 's none of your business what she eats , you yuppie snob . That 's my date ! Yeah , well , you know , you sure know how to pick ' em . What 's the matter ... are you jealous ? No , I 'm not jealous ! Then butt out ! Why don 't you make me ? - Just make me . - You think I won 't ? Yeah , sure . Try . - There ! - That 's all you got ? Huh ? - Stop it ! - Did it again ! Did it again ! Dylan , stop ... stop it . I won 't . No , I 'm not going to . I won 't . Hey , Donna . - Hey . - Hey . I was just putting on some aftershave . Just freshening up a little . I 'm gonna go . Donna . Dylan ? Donna , wait ! I was just making a joke ! I was just ... putting on aftershave . You are gonna speak to me again before we die , right ? What do you want me to say , Rebecca ? Thank you . I 'm so glad you made us look like idiots . You didn 't even apologize to Dr. Maynard . I don 't like Dr. Maynard . He always looks at me like he 's trying to guess my weight . He was trying to raise money for an important project I happen to be involved with . Phillip , I can 't say what happened . I think maybe I dozed off for a second . I was confused . - Haven 't you ever done that ? - That 's not it . I mean , that may be true , but ... Something is happening to you . And I don 't know if it 's what happened before or not . It 's not . Believe me . Okay , then what ? What ? I don 't know , Phillip . Sometimes ... sometimes you just look at everything and it 's all just different . Do you know ? Yeah , I do . They call that puberty . No , it isn 't just that and it never stops . It 's like ... like shedding your skin . Is that what you 're doing ? Shedding ? Yeah , I guess , sort of . Shedding me ? Oh , no . No . - Hey . - Hi . I 'm really sorry . I know I messed it up . I know . No , no . It 's cool . I would have messed it up myself anyway . - You just saved me time . - Give yourself a little credit . That girl really likes you . Well , if she did , I think she got over that pretty quick when she caught me talking to the little man inside my head . Yeah , right . It 's just sometimes when I 'm with you , I forget myself . You feel funny . - What ? - Don 't you feel funny ? Like , not ... not a fever , but ... Oh , I , um ... I was ... previously engaged in a certain kind of activity and ... Oh ! Uh ... Well , you smell nice . Kinda sweaty . Sorry , that ... that was out of line . I didn 't , uh ... I should go . Okay . Well , look , I 'm sorry about tonight . Yeah , me , too . Well , good night . Good night . Good night . Good night . Good night . Okay , well , wait , here comes a good one . " Number seven , how does your partner rate as a lover ? " - Pass . - No , wait ! Pass , pass , pass ! That 's none of your business . Of course it 's my business . Hush up ! " You describe your lovemaking as ... A , wild animals : , B , sweet and slow : , C , at least he tries : , D " ... - Who 's he talking to ? - I don 't know . Uh , B ? A. No , no . Yeah . B ? Okay , if you say so . " Nine , how often do you and your mate ... " No , pass ! - Why ? - Pass ! Come on , this isn 't gonna work unless ... Wait ! Turn up the radio . Oh , you like this ? Yeah , I love this song . Oh , yeah , I remember this . # I stand up so I can fall # I storm out # So I can wait for you to call # I just look at you # Baby , that 's all # I 'm crumbling # I 'm crumbling # I wake up and you 're not there # I call all my friends # Tell ' em I don 't care # I 'm so cool , baby , and debonair # I 'm crumbling ... # Ahem ! - Hey ! - Phillip . Hi . Is this more shedding ? No . This is dancing . Uh , yeah , it is . - Okay , um ... - I 'll see you . So what brings the party down here ? I was just looking for my old photo albums . I thought they were in the corner . Uh , yeah . Yeah , last time I saw them , they were ... God , I hope Bridget didn 't throw them out . No , that doesn 't make any sense . She would have asked ... Hey , you know , I ran into Diane . She said you were gonna do the painting class . - The drawing class . - The drawing class , yeah . Yeah , I don 't have to . What ? No , I think that 's great ! You know ? Get you out of your ... the cellar . Why would Bridget throw out my photos ? No , no , I 'm not saying ... just , you know ... whatever by accident . What do you want with them anyway ? Nothing , I just wanted to show them to Dyl ... to ... to , um , myself . Look at them . I mean , I 'm not saying don 't find them . It 's a healthy thing . That 's good . And actually , I can help you look for them . I have my council meeting at 6 : 00 , but , you know , it won 't kill me to be a few minutes late . Yes , it will . Thank you for knowing that about me . Hey , is my grey shirt clean ? Yeah . I 'll check . Thank you . Everything come out all right ? You 're drunk ! I ain 't had hardly nothing to drink . But give me time , partner . I got wine on my damn pants . What 's Phillip gonna think ? - Where is old Phil ? - Meeting . Have I given you the tour of my luxurious home ? Yeah , you have . Elegant modern entertainment center . The perfect addition to every home . Did you find those pictures you were gonna show me ? Mm . Ah ! They 're gone . W ... wait a minute , what happened ? They 're gone . I have been through the entire attractively furnished house . Maybe the maid ate them . Or maybe my husband slipped them into the trash . Are you serious ? Why the hell would he do that ? Because he knows me . Phillip takes care of me . That 's not taking ... that 's ... that sucks . He 's not being mean . He knows how funky I get sometimes looking through that stuff . It doesn 't matter anyway . I know them all by heart . There 's my mom when she 's little . She has my eyes . Blue-grey with flecks of panic . And here 's Mom teaching me how to swim . Notice how I 'm grafted to her arm . Not a success . And there 's a picture of a pony . I don 't know why it 's in there or who it belonged to , but there it is anyway . And there 's my dad . The scariest man who ever lived . Grown-ups were scared of him . All they ever taught me was how to be afraid . And I went out and found the copingest man alive so he could take care of me . So he could get rid of the past . Chipping away at it ... all my little quirks and insecurities . Until ... voilà . Nothing left . Nothing like a little truth to sober you up , huh ? Tell you about my family . I got a brother named Mitch . I think he lives down in Louisville now , moved 1,500 miles away so that he wouldn 't have to loan me any more money . My mom , I put her through so much , by the time I got popped , she had stopped talking to me . She didn 't even wait for the trial . I 've never met anyone I didn 't disappoint . I mean , the best thing , the only thing , about me that I like is you . # I wanna feel your touch # It 's burning me like an ember ... # Oh , fuck . I wish you weren 't so damn pretty , Becky Porter . I know that 's dumb and shallow and ... I mean , you 're a married woman and I 'm on parole . Still , sometimes I think ... I just wish you weren 't so damn pretty . # So I 'm giving in # To the trouble I 'm in # So I 'm giving in # To the trouble I 'm in # To the trouble I 'm in ... # I wanna know what you feel like . # You are , you are # My favorite medicine # You are , you are # You 're where the lights begin # You are , you are # Just one last time again # You are , you are # You are the trouble I 'm in # You are the trouble I 'm in # You are the trouble I 'm in # You are , you are # My favorite medicine # You are , you are # You 're where the lights begin # You are , you are # Just one last time again # You are , you are # You are the trouble I 'm in # You are the trouble I 'm in # Ooh , ooh , # Oh , cut it out . It 's good ! It 's cool ! Look at Diane 's . That 's a little abstract , there , darling . Try drawing the nice man . Dylan , my office . Gotta go , darlin ' . Okay , I 'll see you . What 's going on , Jake ? It 's no good . What is ? It 's no good . It doesn 't work . Wait , wait . Am I fired ? Okay , you and me , Dylan . Okay ? What would you do ? Keep the ex-con who talks to himself all day ? You frighten the customers . Look , next time you get a gig , okay , just let your imaginary friend stay at home . Okay . You gotta start living in the world , brother . You gotta be where you at . You understand what I 'm saying ? - Be where you at . - Okay . I 'll give you a recommendation if you need one . I won 't lie , but I 'll ... I 'll say you were honest . Okay . What happened , bro ? Hon , I 'm your friend . Oh , good . I mean , yes , of course you are . You can tell me . You really should . Sweetie , I honestly ... I have no idea what you 're talking about . Not at all ? Well , everybody 's concerned . Is something going on ? You can tell me . There 's just really nothing to tell . - Have you been seeing someone ? - Oh , God , no . No , no , no , no , no . I couldn 't . I 'm married . I would never ... Oh , I meant a shrink . You 're having an affair . Oh , my God ! No , no , no , no . You don 't have to tell me who unless you want to . - Diane , honestly ... - Because I 'm very good at keeping ... Diane , I 'm not ... I 'm not having an affair . Oh , and we never had this conversation . Oh , poor Phillip . Oh , I didn 't mean that . You know what ? You don 't have to tell me who . That just explains everything . Explains what ? Well , I don 't mind telling you now that I know you 're not crazy , but everybody 's talking . Well , you must know that . Everybody 's talking about me . Why ? - Don 't they have lives ? - My lips are sealed . They are Ziploc 'd . You don 't have to tell me who he is , but is it someone I know ? Diane , honestly , I 'm not having an affair . I 'm not , I swear . Okay ? I 'm just crazy . # I 'm runnin ' nonstop day after day ... # Amazing ! That 's possibly the greatest game of pool ever played . - Hi , Dylan . - Oh , hey . Queen of the rodeo . Rodeo queen , huh ? What , you came to watch me make pool history ? Oh ! Had a few pitchers , haven 't you ? You know , my only regret is that I gave up my law practice to become a showgirl . - Can I pour myself one ? - Yeah , yeah . Yeah , yeah . Hey , hey , hey . Have a beer . I 'm just gonna find this ball . So , Wayne says that Jake gave you the can . - That blows . - Don 't it , sister ? Where the hell you been hiding at , Dill Pickle ? Thank God you 've come . Is it time to do crimes ? Yeah , man , we 've been waiting on you . Cue ball . All right , enough dicking around . Are we doing this or not ? Hell yes ! Let 's do it . Let 's do it . All right , here 's the address . I need you to roll up there and check the place out . We go in Thursday night . Let 's do it now . Let 's do it now ! I mean , what am I waiting for ? Right ? This is what I do . I mean , I 'm a criminal-element-man type , man . Just like you . Like , who am I kidding ? Maybe you 've had enough , Dill . Maybe you wanna head home , sleep it off . Oh , no , I want some action ! I want some " Action Jackson ! " Come on , let 's get lost ! Hey , you can be my mom . Yeah . I mean , I gotta have a mom . You see , I got this problem , though . It 's that Jiminy the Cricket is gonna get all upset with me , man , and I can 't go messing with Jiminy the Cricket . She lives in my head with Mr. Crick ... excuse me , Dr. Cricket . And what am I gonna do when she finds out that I 'm just like everybody said . What am I gonna do then , Bo ? You got voices in your head ? Is that what you 're saying ? You don 't believe me ? - Donna ? - He does . Yeah , I have a world of craziness up here , man . So you might wanna find somebody a little more stable to be your wire man . Maybe I 'm not your guy . I mean , burglary 's a pretty tricky piece of business . It 's time to shut your mouth now , Dill . You know what ? I 'm getting so sick of everybody telling me what to do . All right , step back , Dylan . And step back . You two , get the hell out of my bar . All right , Wayne . Put the gun down . Okay , Wayne . - Man , I got a lump on my head ... - Okay , shut up . - ... the size of Nebraska . - Shut up , Lyle , shut up . It 's okay . Everything 's fine . - Am I bleeding , man ? - Everything 's fine . Shut up , Lyle . I don 't care how long we 've known each other . You screw this up ... Bo , look at my hair , man . Am I bleeding ? Bo , man , my head 's gonna be all discolored . Diane . Hi . I just got the call that you were here . To what do I owe this pleasant surprise ? What ? Do you recognize it ? That doesn 't even look any smaller . I never came here again . I was scared . It just felt like there was something here . Something too grown-up . Too real . Do you think this is the place I first went nuts , or does it go further back ? Come on , you 're not crazy , Becky . I was once , right after college , before Phillip and I were engaged . I kind of fell apart . I couldn 't deal with being in the world , so I spent some time in a hospital upstate . Rehabilitating . - I didn 't know about that . - Yeah , you missed that one . Probably because I missed most of it , too . I couldn 't feel anything . I just lay in bed for three months , trying to work up enough energy to cry . Phillip was with me through all of it . He read to me . He sat with me . Tried to get me through it . He probably did . Sure wasn 't me . I 'm so goddamn weak . Becky , how can you say that ? I mean , what you did for me ... Have I made your life any easier , honestly ? Yes . You know , I can 't read your mind , Dylan , but I know when you 're lying . Becky , don 't do this . I can 't live like this . Dylan , Phillip is my husband . I know you don 't like him , but I need to be with him . I need to find him again . Yeah , you gotta do what you 're told , right ? - That 's not fair . - Fair ? I finally ... for once in my life , I can see something ... something real , and then you tell me I gotta give it up . So , how do you come at fair ? I can 't be with you and I ... I can 't play at this anymore . It 's not a game . It 's not something that you play . What am I supposed to do ? You are going to be fine . God , Dylan ... you have so much . You ... you blew me away . You know that . You ... I 'm never gonna forget that . - Couldn 't we just ... - No . How do you expect me to just shut you off ? Because you love me . # They 'll be waiting # Just like before ... # Can I get a whiskey neat , please ? The thing is , you come in here , and there 's always some kind of trouble . Is that what you hear ? About two nights ago , you were in here doing your little MMA-style tango with the Soames brothers . They showed up , I left . We didn 't associate . Dylan , this ain 't a goddamn drill , okay ? You done got yourself fired , you 're hanging out with known felons , and now Lyle is looking to bust your ass all across the desert . Giddons , look , can you ... No ! No ! No ! No , please stop . What 's wrong with you ? Please ! Dylan . Dylan . - What the hell 's wrong with you ? - Those bastards ! Who , who ? Bo and Lyle ? Know what I 'm looking at right now ? A cell . Hey , you tell me what 's going on with them brothers , you won 't even have to think about that . - I 'll take it ... - I mean I 'm looking at it right now . - I 'm in it . - What ? This is where they put me , 'cause this is where they see me : What ? Wait a minute , so this is when you start blaming the whole world for your crap , is that right ? No , no , this is where I stop . We ain 't finished . I want you to get better . Just stop worrying about everything . Everything 's gonna be fine . You just need to be ... alone for a while . No distractions ... till you feel yourself again . Rebecca , I love you . Oh , fuck . There , now be both got lumps on our heads . Hmm ? Come on . It 's Thursday ! Time to go to work , Dill . - I got to be somewhere . - Yeah , and we know where . You know , I told Bo that we should bust you up and leave you there when we 're through , but he 's got a code . Two hours and comfortable living , Dill . No , I need to be somewhere . I 'm asking . And I 'm answering . Dr. Maynard . We 'll worry about forms later . None of your people will even know she was here . I 'm betting she 'll be back to normal in just a couple of months . Maybe . Did you see who was driving that car ? Okay . Good morning , ladies and gentlemen . - Becca ? - This is your captain speaking . We are currently at our cruising altitude of 35,000 feet . Becca . Can you hear me ? Come on , answer me , Rebecca . Dylan . Jesus Christ . Rebecca , what is going on ? Phillip put me in here . I think he thinks I 'm having an affair . So he locks you up ? Can he do that ? I don 't know . I 'm afraid of him . I don 't know what he 's gonna do . God , you feel like you 're underwater . What are they giving you ? Phillip gave me these pills . I took them . He told me to take them , so I took them . Do you know where you are ? Yeah . No . Um ... I think it 's the Hophauer Clinic . It 's a mental institution . Your husband ought to be a permanent resident , darlin ' . Ladies and gentlemen , once again we do request that you ... Are you on a plane ? Yeah , I 'm ... I 'm headed your way . Listen , I need to see the room . I want you to look around . I want to see everything . But is there anything you can do , or ... I understand , sir , but unfortunately we cannot rent you a vehicle without a valid driver 's license . I just ... I just don 't have it with me right now is all and I have a real important job interview . And I do hope you get that job . What I can do is arrange a cab for you . Perhaps a friend can overnight your license while I hold the reser ... - Sir ? - Thanks . Loading and unloading of passengers ... - Where are you ? - Still at the airport . What are you doing ? Renting . Hey , that 's my car . Hey , yo , stop ! No , twist it to the left . - Slowly . - Ah . Okay . Now , see if you can find the empty space in there . Dylan , I can 't do this . I feel like a four-year-old . You can do it . Just relax . This ain 't Fort Knox . These are simple locks . Oh , um , turn here . Where 'd you learn to do all this stuff anyway ? School , mostly . Oh , I always wondered what you guys did in shop . Oh , I bet you took ballet , huh ? Or tea appreciation or something . Oboe . Holy shit ! - Holy shit . - Hot damn ! That took me a week to learn that . You 're a natural born criminal . I bet you say that to all the girls . - Am I close ? - Yeah , I think so . Just keep going all the way through town . It 's right by the train tracks . You can 't miss it . Okay , I 'll find it . Time to get a move on now . Anybody in the hall ? Um ... Wait a sec . Wait till she leaves the hall . Check . Nervous ? Check . Listen , hey , when you get out of there ... you ever seen Canada ? Why ? What did you have in mind ? I thought maybe you 'd like to have a romance in an exotic setting . Go for it . Just walk like you know where you 're going . Oh , shit . Do you have any idea where I am ? No , get back on Main Street . Not a good idea . Shit ! Turn off the engine and show me your hands . Dr. Maynard . How are you doing today ? There there . There , honey . Come on . Here goes nothing . Stop the car ! I said stop ! God . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Dylan , I can 't talk to him . I can 't . Becky , calm down . You can do this . Okay , okay . I 'm just going to walk past him . It 's gonna be totally fine . Rebecca ? What are you doing ? Oh . - Told you I couldn 't talk to him . - Go . Becky , just go . Phillip . Call security . Becca ! He 's gone . The woods . The woods , go ! - Hear that train ? - Yes . Run for it ! - I 'm here . - Where ? Where ? Where ? Here . There 's an open boxcar . See it ? Where ? There 's a red boxcar right here . Red boxcar . See it ? Yes ! Okay , go ! This is gonna be so weird . # Down by the river # It don 't matter which river # They 're all going somewhere # Well , just as long as you 're looking for me # Well , just as long as you 're looking for me # Well , just as long as you 're looking for me # Well , just as long as you 're looking for me # I can be a good friend # And I can be a good lover # And I can be a good lover # But I can 't do both of them # No , I can 't do both # I can hope # Well , just as long as you 're looking for me # Well , just as long as you 're looking for me # Well , just as long as you 're looking for me # Well , just as long as you 're looking for me # Come and stand in the water # Come and stand in the water # Tell me that you don 't care # Shakin 'and a-shiverin' # Time is making jokes at my expense # Well , I 'm dancing in the riverbed # Well , just as long as you 're looking for me # Well , just as long as you 're looking for me # Hey , well , just as long as you 're looking for me # Well , just as long as you 're looking for me # Well , just as long as you 're looking for me # They 're all going somewhere # They 're all going somewhere # They 're all going somewhere # Now you know everything # Did I scare you off , did I show too much ? # The future 's unraveling , I 'm losing my sense of touch # So I reach out in the dark # I hope that you 'll be there to shine some light . #

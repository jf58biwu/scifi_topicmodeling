 [ Wedeck ] On October sixth , the planet blacked out for two minutes and 17 seconds . The whole world saw the future . [ Janis ] In my flash forward , I saw that I was pregnant . I have to conceive this baby next week to match what I saw . [ Mark ] There 's a guy we 've been investigating . We 've been calling him " D. Gibbons . " Charlie said , " D. Gibbons is a bad man . " - You haven 't asked her about it ? - I 've tried . She 's shut down . Everything bad we saw was here in LA . What if we just ran , upped and moved away ? [ Vogel ] Ganwar region , 1991 . There were reports of a mass loss of consciousness . Photos show five towers . I designed that . You can 't make sense of the tower without me , and you know it . OK , try this one . [ Speaking in a foreign language ] [ Repeating in foreign language ] It means , " I don 't eat dairy . " OK , try this one . [ Speaking in a foreign language ] [ Repeating in foreign language ] Yeah . It means , " What did you see ? " So ... [ speaks in a foreign language ] - I was baking bread . - Bread ! Yes ! [ Chuckles ] - And you ? - I was waterskiing . Good for you . Hey , I thought this weekend , you 're supposed to bake bread . Vogel 's little field trip kind of closed the window on that . [ Man speaking indistinctly over radio ] [ Man over radio ] All right , put her down . Got that one ? - If you have your key , unlock it . - Go ahead , set it down . - I want a gun . - It 's not happening . Going into Somalia without a gun is like going scuba diving without an oxygen tank . You 're here in an advisory role . They 're here to back us up . I suggest you stay close to them . Let 's get to the tower and get out of here . OK , this is what we 're gonna do . I want you guys to get all the equipment out of the helicopter ... - [ keyboard tapping ] - [ Knocks ] Come in . What is that ? The Hydra . Seven heads , bad breath , killed by Hercules . - Why am I looking at it ? - D. Gibbons . Dyson Frost . Simcoe gave us his name . Here 's the rest of the story . Brilliant , reclusive particle physicist . Trained in engineering at MIT , minored in Victorian lit . - An achiever . - [ Mark ] Typical story . Domineering father , only spoke to him in French , - even though they grew up in Wyoming . - Mm . Became a chess grandmaster at 15 . The chess piece you found in Pigeon . The white queen . Apparently , he still plays , which is weird considering he was killed in a boating accident in 1990 on a boat called Le monstre de Boisteau . - " Boisteau 's monster . " - Who 's Boisteau ? Pierre Boisteau , 18th-century French writer . He had illustrations of monsters in some of his books . Among the more well-known , the Hydra . - The Hydra . - On my board on the 29th . It 's all leading back to Frost . Somehow , he 's even part of Charlie 's vision . - Charlie saw him ? - D. Gibbons is a bad man . [ Mark ] " D. Gibbons is a bad man . " It 's all I 've been able to get out of her . Meanwhile , everything we know about him is coming to a head . All we 've got are blind alleys and cryptic messages . What the hell am I supposed to do with that ? Be like Hercules and slay the beast . Keep looking for Dyson Frost . [ Electrical buzzing ] There it is . Abandon hope , all ye who enter here . Keep moving . It 's not so bad here . A bit sleepy . - A little hotter than I expected . - [ Machine gun firing ] [ Shouting ] [ Man speaks in foreign language ] [ Vogel ] Awaale , we need you to translate . Tell them we 're aid workers with Red Panda Resources , a relief organization , protected under articles 59 through 63 of the Geneva Convention . We have a right to humanitarian access . [ Speaking in a foreign language ] [ Man shouting in foreign language ] My name is Abdi Kalif . I speak English . You don 't need him anymore . [ Issues command ] [ Shouting ] [ Abdi ] I know you . I saw you on Al Jazeera , telling the world you caused the blackout . Always nice to meet a fan . [ Men laughing ] You did not cause this . God caused this . He merely put your finger on the button . - We are employees ... - [ guns clicking ] ... of Red Panda . We 're on a relief mission - to deliver cholera kits . - This man is not a relief worker . We are having mechanical problems , OK ? If you let us continue on to our destination ... Do not lie to me ! This was your destination . You arrived at your destination . You came here for a reason . Just like the others . What others ? When I was a boy ... [ sheep bleating ] ... foreigners came to our village and told us they would bring us electricity . They said five towers would provide power till the end of time . That it was a humanitarian act . But those towers were not for electricity . They were for something else , something not humanitarian . I had gone out to tend the goats . I was not away long , only a few moments . But even a single moment can change everything . What happened , it made no sense . I felt afraid . They were there , but they were gone . [ Speaking in a foreign language ] But it was all part of God 's plan . This I learned from my mother . Everything in this life happens for a purpose . And before the hand of death could take hold of me too ... [ braying ] ... I ran . [ Speaks in a foreign language ] [ Men shouting ] Let me go ! Come on . I 'm just a pilot ! That man , for instance , is here for a purpose . [ Man shouting ] [ Machine gun firing ] And now , he has served it . You are here for a reason . And I will kill you , all of you , if you do not tell me what that reason is . [ Bryce vomiting ] [ Panting ] [ Pager beeping ] [ Gasping ] Oh , damn . - I 'm so sorry . - It 's not a big deal . Are you OK ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Oh , a little light reading ? - I like the pictures . - Seriously ? Orgo ? OK , just shut up for a second . I 'm ... I 'm kind of ... - I 'm thinking about possibly ... - Thinking about possibly what ? I 'm trying out a pre-med class , all right ? - So that 's the big secret ? - Well , I don 't want people to know about it because it 's hard . I don 't want them to see me fall on my face . " Dr. Kirby . " It 's got a nice ring to it . Mm-hm . That 's very funny . Thank you . No , seriously , that 's the most difficult thing about becoming a doctor , is picking the right name . I mean , take me , for instance . My real name is Martin Goathead . [ Chuckles ] - You 're an idiot . - Really ? Martin Goathead . Yeah , I think I like Bryce Varley better . Of course you do . It sounds rugged . It 's like a guy that eats protein bars and climbs mountains . Dr. Bryce Varley . Promise me you won 't tell anybody , please . Nicole , I wouldn 't do that to you . [ coughing ] - Are you sure you 're all right ? - Oh , look at you . Diagnosing patients already . - I 'm fine . Look , I got to run ... - [ pager beeping ] ... Dr. Kirby . - Dr. Goathead . [ Men chattering ] [ Janis ] Why don 't we tell him who we are and why we 're here ? We 're not breaking cover . [ Demetri ] He 's not buying the Red Panda bit . I 'm not gonna sit around waiting for a bullet in my head . [ Sighs ] Right . 'Cause you 're waiting for three to the chest . - What did you say ? - You heard me . Doesn 't matter if it happens here or your couch or in the arms of your soon-to-be widow . Let 's face it . You 're done . [ Both grunting ] - [ Grunting ] - [ Shouting ] [ Gun cocking ] - Hey , I thought we said not the face . - My ball to call . [ Chuckles ] Let 's get to the chopper . Get the guns , neutralize Abdi 's men . - Then we interrogate him . - Let 's move . [ sniffs ] If all goes well , you might get that gun . [ Indistinct chattering ] Now , once we start firing , Abdi 's other men are gonna be coming . Take the shot . Fire . Let 's go ! Go , go , go ! Get the weapons ! [ Grunting ] Move ! He 's down ! Come on ! Simon ! Come on . - [ Engine rumbling ] - Here they come ! - What the hell is that ? - Fire ! Fire ! They failed me , but you will not . You will fulfill your part of the plan . - Honey ? - [ Olivia ] Hey . Lunch is ready . - Hey . - Hey . Three-bedroom colonial with a sun porch . - That 's right . - In Denver . - It 's where we could go . Denver . - Big fan of the omelet . It 's one hell of an omelet . But seriously , I mean , I 've been doing some research . There 's two major hospitals in Denver , and they both need surgeons . And the FBI has a division in Denver . I mean , we can do this . So this is why we 're having lunch . Well , that , and I wanted to see your beautiful face . Mm-hm . The Mile-High City . I could join the ski police . Be home at five . Me by the fire , you wrapped up in a vegan tiger skin . With nothing on underneath . - Doesn 't sound so bad . - Mm-hm . Look , you know , we don 't have to make any decisions right now , - but I think we should soon . - Mm-hm . Hey , there 's something I wanted to talk to you about , too . Something we haven 't been talking about . Charlie , what she saw . We need to know . Livy , we 've needed to know for a while now . I thought we said we were gonna give her time . We were doing that for us , but if she knows something that can help this investigation , then that goes way beyond us . What is it you think that she knows ? There are things that keep coming back . - D. Gibbons . - He 's at the center of everything . I kept thinking I could do this without involving our family , but we can 't ignore this . We can 't deny this anymore . Listen , I have people at the FBI office who know how to talk to kids . I wanna take Charlie down there tomorrow , just see if ... Let me talk to her first . You can take her , but can I try talking to her first ? OK . - This isn 't beyond us , Mark . - I know . And I mean it . Will you take a look at this stuff ? I mean , it is one hell of an omelet . [ Chuckling ] [ Abdi ] On this continent , a child dies every six seconds from malnutrition . Your country could easily provide this food , yet it does not . That 's not true . Every year , we send hundreds of millions of dollars in aid , just to have it stolen by people like you . People who live in heaven shouldn 't judge those who live in hell . Tell me who you people are or I will kill him . Sod off . [ Coughing ] [ Men chuckling ] Who are you ? Tell me . They are CIA here to investigate the tower . - We are security . - [ Laughing ] This is your security ? [ Groaning ] So you are with CIA . - You are not afraid of death . - I 've gotten used to it . What do you want with that tower ? Why have you brought the scientist here ? [ Demetri ] We think what happened on October 6th , the day of the blackout , happened before on a smaller scale in your village , because of the towers . No . I came back from herding the goats , I saw them on the ground . They were dead . It was no blackout . - How do you know they were dead ? - I saw the black camel . What 's the black camel ? Black camel 's considered a bad omen here . " Death is a black camel that kneels at every man 's gate . " They were dead . I returned from the refugee camps changed , a man now . The bodies of my people were gone , and all that remained was a village of ghosts . And there was only one tower left . Word spread that I had lived when others had died . And for this , I became feared . I used this fear and became what I am now . God 's plan . And then , the day of the blackout , I had my prophecy . I saw it . I was making a speech . I spoke of the better angels . ... when again touched by the better angels of our nature . I called myself the new face of Somalia . I was telling the world . I spoke as a conqueror . My enemies crushed . God 's plan . I 'm not willing to wait one day longer ! [ Crowd cheering ] There will be one more war in this land . My war . I will rule this country . The better angels the better warriors , will win . And you will help because you are CIA . You can get me these things . Planes , tanks , boats . What I will need to win my war . That 's not gonna happen . [ Grunts ] Planes , tanks , boats ! You will get me these things . No , no , no , no ! It happens every six seconds . Vogel , just make the call . The request alone will tell our people what 's going on . I 'm not going to make the call because no one 's gonna pick up the call . It 's like I told you before , there is no cavalry . - We 're on our own . - There 's gotta be some options . - Meeting his demands isn 't one of them . - That 's it ? We just die ? Janis , come on . You saw yourself alive on April 29th . That lunatic actually saw himself the leader of this country . Right . " Better angels . " " Better angels . " Which will it be ? [ Speaks in a foreign language ] - Wait . Get off him . - Hey . Which will it be ? - Which will it be ? - Your prophecy is wrong . What you saw , it isn 't what you saw . And I can prove it to you . I know about the better angels . Sit down . You say you know about better angels . Tell me what you know . It 's from Abraham Lincoln 's inaugural address . - Lincoln was ... - Your president . Ended slavery . He was strong , not afraid to crush his enemies . They were fighting a civil war in our country , just like your country . Better Angels was a speech about unity . - About bringing people together . - You do not know what I saw . No , I don 't . But I think I might be able to find someone who did . Can you get on the Internet here ? We created a website where people can come on and share their prophecies with each other . Here . A man was at the Assembly of the African Union at a peace conference . - You were speaking . - How do you know - what this man says is true ? - You tell me . They know your name . They say you were wearing a wire necklace with an amber bead surrounded by two red ones . - Do you have something like that ? - No . But my mother did . [ Young Abdi calling out ] I haven 't seen that necklace or my mother since I was a boy . Someone else says they saw you . They say you were quoting Lincoln . " To every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land , will yet swell the chorus of the Union , when again touched ... " " ... by the better angels of our nature . " You don 't need tanks or guns . Your destiny is to stop the war not start one . - [ Clicking ] - [ Beeping ] - Yes ! Spare ! - [ Cheers , laughs ] I 'm throwing rocks tonight . Mark it , Mommy . - Nice job . - You wanna play ? I think I 'll play after . I wanna talk first . - OK . - [ Sniffs ] Ah , Charlie-bear . So , uh ... do you remember when Tim Tim talked to Squirrelio about heroes ? When Finnegan the Super Shark trapped them in his Snow Globe of Snow-Doom ? Yeah , Squirrelio-zactly ! Yeah . And Tim Tim said that heroes are people who help people , even when it 's hard . Yeah ? Well , I need you to be like a hero , Charlie . - How ? - I need you to be brave and tell me what you saw in your flash forward . Hey , it 's OK to be afraid . It really is . It 's OK . But , if you tell me , you might be able to help me , you might be able to help Daddy , help a whole lot of people we don 't even know . - If I tell you ... - Mm-hm ? ... something bad will happen . - No . No , it won 't . Nothing bad 's gonna happen . I promise , OK ? Nothing . Can you tell me what you saw ? Go ahead . It 's your house , too . We were in the kitchen , and Dylan wanted a cookie . Daddy says that you said , " D. Gibbons is a bad man . " Why 'd you say that ? [ Lloyd ] The man you call " D. Gibbons " lied to you . [ Charlie ] He heard his dad . He said D. Gibbons lied . Bad people lie . [ Charlie ] And Dylan made the magnets say that - on the refrigerator . - Bad people lie . But you didn 't see D. Gibbons ? He wasn 't in the house ? Keep going , sweetie . What else did you see ? [ Charlie ] I heard fireworks . And I went to the back door . I saw a man walk up to another man . They were wearing suits . And he said ... It 's OK , sweetie . You can do it . What did he say ? [ Vogel ] Mark Benford is dead . " Mark Benford is dead . " " Mark Benford is dead . " - It 's not possible . - It 's what she heard . " Mark Benford is dead . " It 's why she 's been so frightened to tell us . She 's afraid her daddy 's gonna die . That 's not gonna happen , Olivia . On April 29th , I 'm gonna be in my office , at my board , alive . Livy , whatever Charlie saw , what she said ... It 's not that . Then what is it ? It 's just that this is the part where I tell you that we could escape this . We could go to Denver . We could go anywhere and get away from it all . Get away from all of this . And this is the part where you tell me that you won 't . Right . There 's gonna be another blackout . And I have to see this through . I have to try and stop it . I have to try . What happened to the world , happened in your village first . - At least , that 's our operating theory . - Your people didn 't die , - they were blacked out . - They had prophecies ? That 's what we think . We had hoped to find some of them and talk to them . The war came when I was gone . My people , my mother , they must have been driven away . I saw the black camel . I thought the devil had taken their souls . The Qur 'an , chapter 66 , verse six : " Save yourself and your families from a fire whose fuel is men and stones . " I painted it myself , as a warning . In all my time , I haven 't been in there . Devil or no , it is an evil place . But there is one thing that can push a man more than fear . - What 's that ? - Destiny . - You look like you 've seen a ghost . - No , it 's entirely the opposite . What I designed was theoretical , it could only be done in the future . And yet , it 's been standing here for 18 years . Welcome to the future . You said these designs were stolen from you . This was built in ' 91 , but you didn 't come up with the concept till ' 92 . - I don 't know how that 's possible . - Someone invented it before you . - No , this is exactly what I designed . - I don 't get it . Whoever did this , why would they leave it behind for somebody to find ? They were hauling these things away , and then the war came . Why didn 't they ever come back to finish ? The war hasn 't stopped . [ Demetri ] I found something . It 's a chess board . - It 's been sitting here for 18 years . - And we have portable power . Here 's to hoping . [ Man on tape ] What did you see ? [ Speaking in foreign language ] - I knew this boy . He was my friend . - What did he say ? - He said he saw himself playing a game . - [ man ] And did it happen ? He said what he saw came true . [ Man ] What did you see ? [ Speaking in a foreign language ] This is my mother . She was looking for me . She couldn 't find me , but she had hope . She knew I would survive , that I would become great . The preceding interviews from test group B confirm that the subjects uniformly experienced a consciousness shift two weeks into the future . That 's the man who shot at us in Utah . That 's D. Gibbons . - D. Gibbons was here in 1991 . - [ Simon ] Conducting an experiment . You see , God didn 't have anything to do with this . This was man . [ Simon ] Over here ! What do you see , Simon ? Simon ! This tunnel , the vacuum systems , the lead shielding . It 's a linear accelerator . One of five . Smaller , less powerful versions than the ones we used at NLAP . They ran a perimeter around the village . Somehow , they unleashed a tachyon burst , creating a beta test of the global blackout in this village . You weren 't in the village at the time the experiment was conducted . Explains why you didn 't lose consciousness . If what you 're saying is true , it took five accelerators to create this beta blackout . No way that just one knocked out the entire world , right ? How can you possibly say that ? Technology moves fast , Agent Noh . Even if you knew the rules , which you don 't , I don 't think they apply anymore . I got something down here ! Ready ? Go . I don 't think your people were driven off by the war . They were shot . Executed . All of them . [ Demetri ] Remote village , war-time . Given all the unrest , they knew nobody would ever find these people . They showed them tomorrow and ripped it away . You said God had nothing to do with this . That it was man . But it was not any man . It was you . No . Those plans were stolen from me . I said you were sent here for a reason . Now I know what that reason is . - God delivered you to me ... - Abdi , no ! ... so I could avenge my people . Let your end mark a new beginning ! No ! [ Janis ] Oh , my God ! Better angels , his vision ... This wasn 't supposed to happen . You want some cookies to go with that milk ? No . I want to leave . I wanna go away with you and with Charlie . I just wanna get away from all of this , from everything that we saw . Yes or no ? [ Whispering ] Livy ... Yes or no ? You want to say both , don 't you ? That 's who you are , Mark . You can 't have it both ways . This is what we signed on for . You save lives , I save lives . - This is how we do it . - But we saw how we did it . You 're at your office . I 'm here with Charlie hearing you 've died . I love you , Mark . That doesn 't work for me . - This is how it happens . - Don 't say that . You say you need things to play out like you saw . You want them to , you need to . You 're forgetting there 's another part to what we saw . The part where we 're not together anymore . Livy , I don 't want that . You can 't have it both ways . Yes or no ? - Hey . - Whoa , where 'd you get that ? Abdi 's men . Brutalized his people , but they were too scared to say anything because destiny said he was their leader . We changed their destiny today . Rum ? [ Chuckles ] Yeah . To yet another flash forward never coming true . - You OK ? - Yeah . Fine . So what ? I don 't have a baby . Who cares ? - Lots of people don 't have babies . - You 'll still have a baby , right ? - Yeah , but I can 't have Willa . - You named her . Willa . - That 's nice . - Well , I would have . It was supposed to happen this weekend . And now her window 's closed , and she 's never gonna get here . - [ Chuckling ] God ! - What ? It 's ... It 's so stupid . I just saw a mass grave , and all I can think about is a mythical baby . Grave , the baby ... You 're having a circle of life moment , right ? You know , the weekend 's not over . [ Both cracking up ] I 'm just saying , if it 's baby-making you need , I will take one for the team . OK . First of all , - no offense , but that 's kind of gross . - What ? And , second of all , that 's like a thousand percent wrong . - Desperate times . - I 'm gay . I will make you gayer . Oh , yeah ? What about Zoey ? Chances are I 'm not gonna be around in a couple of months , OK ? I think it 'd be nice if Willa was . - Are you serious ? - Mm-hm . - How the hell did you get that ? - I fixed their satellite TV . I know you think that I can 't handle weapons , but in my vision I was killing a man . Didn 't even need a gun . - How many fingers did you have ? - Enough to do the job . What about you ? What did you see ? [ Fireworks bursting ] OK . Mark Benford is dead . I was doing my job . What are you doing ? I promised our little snowboarder that if he held still for his X-ray , I 'd get him 100 packets of graham crackers . You know , I 've raided every floor , and I 'm still only on 46 . - You are so very good at this . - At what ? Listening to people . You know , figuring out what they need . Bribing them with baked goods . It 's gonna make you a really good doctor one day . I can ace graham crackers . It 's organic chemistry I 'm worried about . Uh ... Here . This is for you . - A calculator ? - That 's not just any calculator . No . I bought that my junior year at Duke , right before I miraculously passed a physics final . And , ever since then , MCATs , med school , board exams , that 's been my good luck charm . This is great . Up until today , my good luck charm was a Brainy Smurf . - You really think I can do this ? - Yeah , I really do . - Not just saying that to be nice ? - Well , I don 't lie , and I 'm not nice . Four years of college . - Four years of med school . - Yeah . - Four years of psychiatric residency . - Psychiatry , huh ? Like you said , I 'm a good listener . Plus , I 'm an expert when it comes to dealing with people with problems . So 12 years from now , when I finish my training , we 'll be able to work together . Twelve years ? You 'll probably be head of the department by then . Yeah , about that ... Nicole , earlier today , I lied to you . What do you mean ? I told you that everything was fine with me . It 's not . Twelve years from now , I 'm not so sure that I 'm gonna be around . [ Dyson ] The preceding interviews from test group B confirm that the subjects uniformly experienced a consciousness shift two weeks into the future . [ Door opening ] - What are you doing ? - I couldn 't sleep . Just packing up stuff to take back to the Bureau . - That all ? - No . Thinking . Little things . Life , death , fate . Careful not to ponder too much . The ancient Greeks did it all the time , usually ended up dead . Well , all of them wound up dead . What the hell ? Hello , Demetri . My name is Dyson Frost , and I 'm recording this message in 1991 . Got your attention , didn 't I ?

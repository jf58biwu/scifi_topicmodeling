 You know , if the chosen ones are infected with virus x , they 'll become Galactors . Don 't worry . As long as the stone is shining , they 'll still protect us even though they were infected . But what if the light of the stone has faded ? Until then ... Year 2015 Eastern Europe 21 st Century Strange monsters appeared everywhere . A large-scale war is spreading throughout the world . A red light armor that can hold against all attacks , it didn 't work in the various wars initiated by mankind . The 1 7th day after the war started . Half of the world has been subdued by unknown forces . These new conquerors called themselves as Galactors . Many people were killed . The world is filled with grief and agony . Many children have lost their parents and siblings were separated . Humanity are only allowed to live in certain regions . They are waiting for extinction . And they put their last hope on one thing . Ken ! Run ! Ken ! Hand over the stone ! Ken ! Are you awake , The Chosen One ? This incredible crystal known as stone possesses power to control the superhero ninja agents . We called them as Gatchaman . 1 3 Years Later , Tokyo . 1 9th , Galactors have appeared in North Sanriku connecting with North Kitakyushu. ln addition , this month 's unempolyment rate is 29.3 % . Has increased 2.5 % compared to last month . Overseas migration exceeded 9 millions people . Sis ! I can buy with my salary . Don 't worry . No . Why you need so much clothes for your mission ? Since it 's a submerge mission , of course I need more clothes . What do you mean ? It 's about human observation and intelligence gathering ... Hey ! You can 't tell anyone about ... the Ministry of Home Affairs ' main objective ! Why not ? You can 't tell anyone . You 're doing something that you shouldn 't be as well . It 's confidential. lf using proper channels ... That 'll be too complicated , so we 're sneaking in . Hey , let 's steal the recipes of that 3-star restaurant , what do you say ? You 're so low . Just forget about it ! Don 't worry . We 'll see again very soon . Yes . Bye . Oh , yes . Mom , you should listen to doctor 's advice . Take medicine according to time so that you can recover soon . Yes . Thank you . Mission completed . This day has finally come . Our enemy is the iso conference . ( iso : International Science Organization ) Scientists , the governments , endophytes and plutocrats ... from all over the world are our targets . Comebat Code , Last Suicide The final ... suicide . Though this is the first combat for you , but it is the last combat as well . Understood . What 's that ? Galactors have showed up . Strange weapons are approaching Nishi-Shinjuku 's defensive line . Everyone ! Repeat one more time ! It 's the Galactors ... Hurry ! Jinpei ! Dodge ! Fire ! Suprisingly , the Galactors and human DNA are 99 % identical . iso Tokyo branch . The 1 % difference is virus X. Human civilization destruction , the thing that had claimed countless lives ... With horrific power , this is ... Virus X. Western calendar , Year 1 71 8 . We 've uncovered 28 unknown crystals from the ancient ruins in Africa Inland . We called them as stone . Red alert . The Galactors are approaching . Expected target is our building . Please move to the evacuation zones immediately . Please be quiet , everyone . Don 't worry . We 've made a plan . The light emits from the stone is generally known as G-particles . It can defeat the faceless , armoured Galactors , detroy Virus X , and suppress destruction activities . Evil people , can you see the substanceless but only white shadow me ? As we touch it , it 's just a stone . But as iso agents touch it , it 'll become light of hope . They gather together the chosen ones , provide them with trainings , and turn them into supreme weapons against the Galactors . Ken Washio . Jinpei Ohtsuki . G-Force Science Ninja Team ! Don 't be so happy . Ryu Nakanishi . Jun Ohtsuki . I was going to take care of both ... Something bigger is waiting for us . Yes . The enemy 's weapons are heading East along Yasukuni Highway at 40km / h . Estimated to arrive at iso in 7 : 20 minutes . Massive fire rips through Shinjuku ! Neutron weapons are requested ! This is HQ ! Neutron weapons are prohibited ! G-Force will be right there . This is G-Force ! Reaching destination in 40 seconds . Understood . Well , the 3-star recipes , I 'm counting on you . I know you 're going to say like that . This isn 't the time to chit-chat ! Target 's found in the city center . After the target via the coffee shop in Shinjuku-sanchome . Roger ! identical with the registered model 363B in database and evidence . PCB bombs , huh ? Which has taken millions of lives ... Retreat ! And stop it ! Roger ! Roger ! This monster ... Jun ! Understood ! Ryu ! Jinpei ! They 're coming ... Micro bombs . Enemy 's weapons are 2,000 meters away from iso HQ . 3 minutes until explosion . Ouch ! Are you serious ? Get ready ! It 's so hot ! Jinpei ! What 's wrong , Jinpei ? Don 't stop , Jun ! 50 seconds until explosion ! Disarm the bomb first ! Yes , understood ! Laser ! George Asakura ! Amazing ! Who is he ? You know him ? Alright ! The last one ! Huh ? No way ! Why ? 30 seconds left . Jupiter enters moon 's shadow ! Gate opens ! Hey ! What is this all about ? ! 1 0 seconds left . Sis ! Alright ! Well done , Ken ! George ! Who is he ? You know him ? Haha ! They 're brother and sister . They were asking the same thing . Huh ? Oh , yes . You should use your brain more , Ryu . Huh ? So that it 'll become like a computer in 21 st century . Why do you know about us ? Data about you two have been recored basically . I 'm George Asakura , from iso Europe . Nice to meet you . Nice to meet you . Nice to meet you . iso East Asia Branch . Thank you for saving Jinpei . We won 't be this lucky all the time . The mission is much more important . You must complete the mission even if I 'm in danger . Yes ! This is our rules , right ? George seems like your old friend . Yeah . We 've known each other for 1 3 years . We 've been together ever since our parents were killed by Galactors . Same as you , Jinpei . My parents are still alive . The enemy has taken them captive . I see. I 'm sorry . I 'll save them out one day . I want to cook something delicious ! And it was really funny back there . This gorilla had fallen heavily into the tub . Don 't make fun of others ! You 're gonna pay for it someday ! Sheesh ! Gorilla ! Alright ! That 's enough . I 've heard enough ! At this rate , both of you will be together when there 's a mission , huh ? No way ! I 've had enough being together with this gorilla ! Ohtsuki-chan , the way your brother talks as if he 's looking for a fight . Anti-gravity response ... Do as you please . We shall see later . How about Ryu ? He seems strong but always goes to the hospital . Just a slightly runny nose , he 'll go to the hospital immediately . But this place is like a hospital , ain 't it ? Whether you 're sneezing or coughing , just go to the HQ . Yeah . Hey , do we need to record data like this as well ? The relationship between the two of you , I can tell even if without data . You mean this gorilla and me ? Come on ! With a monkey , huh ? That 's disgusting ! Hey , what about Ken ? What does he normally do ? I 'm not sure . All I know is that he eats hotdog every day . I don 't know what 's on his mind . Ken , he will only obey to the rules set by himself . Oh , yes . My sister confessed to him just recently and got rejected . Jinpei ! She 's been rejected ! You should 've told us ! I didn 't say anything . A woman that can 't cook , of course she 'll get rejected . Later on , he felt relieved and restless somehow . It must be Naomi ! Huh ? The reason she got rejected . Naomi ? A love triangle , huh ? It 's just like I thought . Naomi ! Are you the kind of girls that will get fired up when having competitors ? Yes . Oh . No . That 's not what I mean . Sis ! I got you ! Not bad. I don 't hate this kind of ... No ! I 'm not talking about this ... Yeah ! Ken has rejected you , but it 's not recorded in the data . How 's the situation in Europe ? We 've tried our best to rescue the refugees that sent the distress signal . But all that 's waiting us was mountain of corpses . The Galactors were a step ahead us . One of them can kill up to 1 00 thousands of people . They were just a year earlier than us stepping into the world of real combat . My freedom was taken since I was a boy. I 've been training hard . Even so , I still couldn 't do anything . What 's the meaning of living ? There 's no need for a meaning . The stone chose us . Only the chosen ones can beat the Galactors . Hence , we 've no choice . You 've changed , Ken . You 've become better . I just want to avenge Naomi . Are you serious ? Dr. Kirkland . The experiment has entered the final stage . You don 't need those toys to help you save the future anymore . Now you can end the war with this . And you can 't reject it . Excuse me . You 'll gain back your freedom very soon . What do you think , Captain George ? George might break the rules and disrupt the teamwork . Like you in 5 years ago ? Yes . Go back to Tokyo . Last Suicide isn 't over yet . Enemy 's actual target is here . The cadres of Glactors that were fighting with you have opened the moving door and another door has appeared in north of 203 district 84 at the same time . Berg Katse has sneaked into Tokyo while we we were focusing on repelling sayibowu break . But Berg Katse is a girl . I 'm surprised . I hope we can catch her as soon as possible . Not after we gathered info from the intelligence department . We still have some other missions . Protect the info provider . As long as he 's alive , the truth of Last Suicide will be revealed . is the info he provided genuine ? Yes . His name is Ilya . The second-rate person of Galactors . But she was defeated by Berg Katse in jockeying for power . Now he 's escaped to Tokyo ... and brought back some information . You got what I mean ? We must protect lriya at all costs . And stop Last Suicide ! Understood . Here 's an advise for you , George . Don 't kill lriya . The future is much more important than revenge now ? Yes . So , you shouldn 't kill lriya . After 6 hours , Tokyo . I 'm counting on you . Okay . How is it ? Hey ! At least say something ! Are you stuck on me ? How is it , Jinpei ? Wait ! Just a little ... Hurry ! We 're almost there ! Please take care of them , George . Got it . Please come in . Please come in . Please put your hands here . Please put your hands here . Hurry ! Jinpei ! I got it ! Please put your hands here . Please put your hands here , Sir . Please do it again . Are you okay ? This is strange. lt 's broken , huh ? What a beautiful necktie ! I 'm sorry . It 's okay . That 's so close . Take back Europe . And take back hometown . Go find lriya . Wait a minute . Couple posing game is over . Tell me about lriya . What has happened ? You 've told George , but why you 're hiding it from your teammates ? While you were in the training camp , George and another teammate and I were already having combat training at the border of Europe . The three of us have been together since the training began . But 5 years ago , as we were rescuing the refugees attacked by Galactors , one was killed . Iriya was the one that killed her . In other words , we 're now protecting our friend 's enemy . The one that was killed , is she Naomi ? George has told you about it . You like Naomi , don 't you ? It has nothing to do with you . Will it halt us from being together ? No way ! No ! That 's not what I meant ! I 'm sick of this conversation . Don 't worry , Jun. Naomi belongs to me . We love each other . Ken 's being supportive , too . Both of you are perfect match . That 's great . Thank goodness . Let 's find lriya then . Wait , what did you just say ? 5 years ago in Central Asia . You didn 't hear it , huh ? You frightened me . You mean you want to get married ? Yes . Please marry me , Naomi . Who would propose in a place like this ? More witnesses , the better . You 're so carefree . The truceline is 4 kilometers away . I 'd like to settle it up before the mission ends . Congratulations . I did it , Ken ! The prioritization is very strange . I 'll protect you with all my life , Naomi . Finally we 've deployed agents in Tokyo . We 're here to protect you , lriya-san . Great ! The earphone seems to be broken , Jinpei. I heard some stray noise . I got it. I 'll send you a new one right away . Please wait . Okay . I 've a grasp of information about you . Let me see your face to check whether you 're the real person . If you 're fake , I 'll kill everyone here . Long time no see . is it okay now ? Am I confirmed an exile now ? Well , not before you tell us about the meaning of Last Suicide . Huh ? What ? ! Are you trying to fool me ? Jinpei . Hey , something 's wrong with the wireless , huh ? What are you doing ? Jinpei . Hey. hungry ? Yeah . Where are you , Ryu ? This is strange . Damn it ! Jun ! Ryu ! Damn ! We 've been betrayed . Jun ! Sis ! Brother ! Protect lriya , Jinpei . I see . If I fire at this distance , I can kill you instantly . Pulling gun at me , huh ? Put down the gun . You hate him , don 't you ? Our mission is to protect him , not killing him . But he killed Naomi . Be cool . Just put down the gun . This is our duty . Hey , Ken . You like Naomi too , don 't you ? Come on ! Don 't make me pull my gun at you . I 'll protect you with all my life , Naomi . Thank you . George ! George ! George ! George ! George ! George ! George ! George ! George ! George ! George ! George ! Damn it ! No , Ken ! The power of the stone is fading ! Retreat immediately ! But ... This is an order , Ken ! Ken ! Naomi ! Once the body and soul are depleted , the power of the stone will disappeared . You must come out now ! Can 't you obey to a simple rules like this ? Where 's Naomi ? Haven 't found her body yet . George refuses to team up with you . I 'll take the responsibility . Please allow me to withdraw myself . You 're not allowed since you 're the chosen one . We 'll transfer you to East Asia region . Damn it ! Human is a foolish creature . If you resist , 600 tons of liquid ammonia will be frozen , and you 'll be locked in an armoured cage . is this how you treat an exile ? What is Last Suicide ? Tell me ! I 'll be punished if I tell you . I didn 't receive any order like that . Order ? Who cares ? Just kill me if you want to ! You 're free now . Alright , tell me now ! You love that woman , don 't you ? And I 've killed her . What are you doing in Tokyo ? When did you become like this ? When ? You want to kill me but you can 't . You 've to keep me alive before receiving further command and information . You 're like a dog that can 't disobey order ! What is Last Suicide ? No . Were you the one that made her suicide ? Tell me ! Well , you should be killed instead . Answer me ! Killing youself ? Using your own hands . What ? Last Suicide is a plan to wipe out all the iso 's scientists and important persons in Tokyo . But only Berg Katse knows how to do it . Alright ! You can kill me now . Why would Berg Katse sneak into Tokyo ? Listen here . Berg Katse has gone nuts . You 'll be attacked if you don 't do it . Sir . What is it , Dr. Kirkland ? That 's the plan . But it 's still in experimental stage . I live because of this . MOSCON was developed for a moment like this . So we must success ! is Dr. Kirkland here ? Please forward my message to him . I 'd like to repent about something particular . I 've killed your wife . No , I didn 't kill her . I tortured her to death after interrogation . Why ? Because she 's Kirkland 's wife . Shut up ! It 's live ammunition this time . To know what Dr. Kirkland is developing , a dreadful interrogation worse than dying was being used on her . Shut up ! But , just put it down . Turn off the video recording . She didn 't say anything . Because she really loved you , Doctor . Everyone . I have a suggestion . A standby command . Huh ? Standby ? What ? ! Are we going to wait until Tokyo is being attacked ? Dr. Kirkland is going to execute his battling strategy . Doctor and his laboratory have developed a MOSCON that will emit streamline beam from the satellite . Emitting streamline beam from artificial satellite ? Yes. lt can destroy the armours . And wipe out all Galactors in the center of Casablanca . What ? What about the captive ? Many people were being enslaved there . Even Dr. Nambu 's family is over there . Sacrifices are necessary for operation execution . We are the chosen ones . Come on , wake up ! Just leave me alone . Normally you can 't move for a week after being hit by high-voltage electric bullet . We are agents . I see . Hey , Ken . Will you still hit me if it 's a real bullet ? Our mission is absolute . That 's our rules . But Naomi wouldn 't do the same . She 'll protect you even if breaking the rules . Bear that in mind . I want to talk to lriya . Be careful . I 've received your message . Really ? We were able to eliminate Galactors , it 's all thanks to my wife for protecting the information . It can 't be helped . I 'll kill you afterwards . I 'll find you even though you 're being protected and hidden . I 'll kill you with my own hands ! And so ? Just go ahead and do what you want . You 're saving a lot of work for me . Target is MOSCON , huh ? But my ... MOSCON cannot be activated without motorizes devices , huh ? Someone like you , it 's impossible that you didn 't take it along . Can you hear me , Ken ? Yes . Iriya has escaped ! Pursue him immediately ! Where 's Jinpei ? Capture lriya is more important now ! Understood ! I 'm coming to save you , Jinpei . Wait ! Bastard ! Good boy . 5th Century B.C. Virus X was brought here from the space . Those got infected were called as zombie in some regions . While some called them as dracula ... or devil . And they were being attacked . During world war ll , virus x was being used by some countries as military purpose . People assumed that the research result on defeat has disappeared . But after half a century . A scientist from Pulaha discovered an underground laboratory ... . and got infected with Virus X. And his name was Berg Katse . Berg Katse ? We got infected with Virus X , and evolved into Galactors . But not everybody will get infected . The probability is one out of 800 millions . Yes . The chosen ones for stone are the chosen ones for Virus X as well . They possess the possibilty of evolving . Transforming is so tiring . You are ... Virus X is omnipotent . No way . Because of death , I can manipulate freely as I want . I can turn into any shapes . You treasure the same ring that we shared . Are you really Naomi ? Can you remember it now ? Those that got infected with Virus X and became Galactors are increasing over time . As Berg Katse came back to life , it 's reached almost 300 peoples . Men were entrusted to inherit . And his name was Berg Katse , too . The second generation . He wanted to wipe out 70 millions of human with 300 Galactors . It 's a good chance as iso started to recruit the chosen ones . They 've helped us to gather up those that can evolve into Galactors . Hence , I 've joined them since then . I was given the chance to choose for the first time ever since I was born . Either to be an agent or a Galactor . I 've chosen freedom . What ? George has made his choice . Now I 'll let you choose . Do you smell Virus X from my lips ? Congratulations . You 've got infected . Naomi . That 's not my name anymore . My name is Berg Katse . Iriya isn 't the third generation , but I am . I 'm entrusted as the symbol of freedom . George wasn 't bound by any rules ever since he was young . I like you about the freedom part . But what about the stone ? You were enslaved by humans because of this stone . You 've lost your freedom . I 'm not a slave . Then why you want to be an agent ? To seek revenge and avenge someone . But I 'm still alive . You 'll gain freedom when you evolve into something surpasses human . Forget your vengeance . And live on freely ! Dear George . Jupiter has entered moon 's shadow . Look . Once you join the Galactors , you can open up the door to the other world . Inspection result . Their compatibility rates are much more higher than the benchmark . This way please . You 're pissed that your parents were killed , huh ? I want to banish the Galactors . Me too ! How about you , George ? Me too ! Well , I 'll give you a chance . Doctor . I 'm waiting for you . I heard a ... woman 's voice . It sounds like ... I can 't answer it , it 's illogical . Yes . Declare the war . Where am I ? Puny human . Never ending retaliation . How selfish . You wanted to avenge your wife that 's why you created MOSCON . Endless retaliation after retaliation . I 'll release you from it . What ? ! There 's only one way to stop the chain of retaliation ! We won 't use the weapons created by human ! Let human use it themselves . And kill themselves with their own hands ! This is the so called Last Suicide . What does justice mean to you after killing millions of people ? Though we don 't have justice as a human , but we have our own justice as Galactors . I know what 's the enemy 's target . It 's Dr. Kirkland 's MOSCON . They approach us in order to hijack him . Dr. Kirkland is going to use his own body as MOSCON 's control device . The enemy wants to control his mental and launch the MOSCON . Targets are New York , Los Angeles , Sydney , Rio de Janeiro , and Tokyo . 30 minutes to launch . Dr. Kirkland was found in the enemy 's fleet . Stop MOSCON from launching . Allow Phoenix to move out . What ? It hasn 't tested yet , are you sure ? If we don 't use it now , we might not get the chance to fly it anymore . Geez . Understood ! Move out now ! I 'm ready to fight ! Ah ! Hurry ! We 'll inform you when the detailed strategty has arrived . Before that , I 've something to ask you . Why did you leave Jinpei behind ? No . He was ... Shut up , Jinpei. I 'm asking Ken now . is lriya more important than your comrades ? I was just doing my job . Stop talking about duty ! Jinpei would 've died if I was late . Stop it ! It 's my negligence . Alright ? Don 't forget that we are the chosen ones . The chosen ones . The chosen ones can only live the life that 's chosen . You 've never changed . Are you crazy ? Am I crazy ? Can 't you be a bit normal ? How can we be normal when we 're like this ? I don 't know . I just want to live a normal life . But the stone has chosen us . And we 're forced to wear those ugly uniform . We fought and killed the enemies and keep on fighting ... But I feel happy sometimes . I guess I 've gone crazy , too . Go take a rest. I can take care of here alone . George . Ken . Do you still remember ? Captain 's duty is not following the rules but to protect his comrades . Well , this is an order ! Five of us , let 's save the mankind together ! Prepare to ascent ! Energy loop open ! Maximum power output ! Using stone 's assault weapons . I heard that the compatible parts for this body have been transplanted , too . We are a brand new siblings ! System activated ! Main engine has been opened ! Main engine starts operating . Phoenix ! Ready to move out . Yes ! Tunnel has been opened . Attack command has been received . Request accepted . Target 1 to 5 have been locked . G-Catridge and rocket booster have been filled . I don 't feel good about it . Relax . Shut up , Monkey . Shut up , Gorilla . 1 8 minutes to launch . Split after sneaking in ! Stop MOSCON from launching . Enemy 's orbital element diamater is 4,1 00 meters . Horizontal plane defense , approximately the fort 's diameter , many of them . Affirmation confirmed . Ready to fight back . Missile preparation 80 % to launch . Jinpei ! Ryu ! Ryu ! Let 's go ! George ! Jinpei ! Jinpei ! Ken ! I 'm fine ! Let 's go ! 1 0 minutes left . Let 's find Kirkland . Hurry ! Understood . You don 't have to remind me . Captain 's duty is not following the rules but to protect his comrades . There you are . I 'm not happy because you didn 't return after borrowing it . Like you can defeat me with an attack like this . You want to take me away or you want to kill me ? Wake up , Naomi ! 7 minutes to launch . Here you are . Dr. Kirkland . What 's this ? How am I supposed to sneak in ? What 's this ? I won 't forgive you ! Giving you freedom ? So this is George 's reply ? I will not become a Galactor ! Well , you should just kill yourself then ! Can you see me , bastards ? Ken ! It 's been a while , Ken . What ? You didn 't tell him , huh ? That 's what friends are for , huh ? I died because of Ken . But I 've gained freedom . What is going on ? Was it Naomi ? It has nothing to do with you . Come one ! Of course it has ! All safety locks have been unclocked . Hello , I 'm Naomi . He 's George , right ? Nice to meet you . This sound ... What ... ? ! MOSCON is going to launch soon ! Hurry , Jinpei ! Well ... Oh , yes . Connect to the control machine directly . Alright ! How is it ? It 's lighting up . Alright . New York is safe . Yes . Los Angelos is safe . Rio de Janeiro and Sydney are safe . Wanna know how we make it ? Well , just move the satellite 's orbit , using science technology and offset the orbit . I see . Ryu . Left only Tokyo now . This is for revenge ... Get away from there , Jinpei . He 's suicide . How 's the situation ? No ! At the rate , I can 't confirm it . Control has been cancelled . Damn it ! Tokyo is late . Any other way to stop it ? No other way but to destroy the satellite , huh ? George ? You must escape ! George ! MOSCON , leave the main fleet . Wanna date me , huh ? I see . It 's over . Did you hear that , Ken ? It 's unavoidable that Tokyo has become MOSCON 's target . Dr. Nambu 's evacution advisory is impossible to be fulfilled now . Ken . Brother ! Go out ! And George ! They are battling in the satellite to stop MOSCON . We can 't lose the five of them now . The rest depends on you now . Go out ! What do we do , Brother ? It 's going to launch soon . The three of you can do it ! I 'm going with George ! No ! I 've finally realized that I want to be with George until the very end . This is the reason I 'm fighting for . I 'm proud that I can cook . It tastes so bad . Jinpei . Indeed . Yeah . No , Ken ! Come out now ! Even to save the remaining four ... I won 't sacrifice anyone . Even to save thousands of people ... I won 't sacrifice anyone . And lastly , George , we , and Tokyo , all of us have come down . We 've been released at last . Actually I really like you , George . That 's why ... I didn 't kill you . Just kill me . The chosen ones will become Galactors . Kill me now . Leaving all the risky tasks to the chosen ones , while hiding youself at somewhere safe , why would you throw your life in for someone like that ? Don 't forget that you can gain the real freedom here once you 've become Berg Katse . Got it ? The chosen ones will become Galactors if they 're infected with Virus X. Don 't worry . As long as the stone is shining , they 'll still protect us even though they were infected . But what if the light of the stone has faded ? Until then ... just kill him . I 'll kill him , too . Stop it ! Ken ! Tell me ! Are you Naomi ? I 'm the one that you love , Ken . The one that George has taken from you . And you want to kill me again . Naomi . Come with me , Ken . Let 's be free together . No . You 're not Naomi . Naomi died since a long time ago . She won 't come back anymore . She 's gone to Heaven . Fulfill your promise now , Ken . This has nothing to do with rules and duty . I fight because I want to protect mankind . I throw myself in because I want to save them . Naomi has saved me back there . Now , it 's my turn to save you ! Ken ! So long , Naomi . Thank you . The last mission . Go ! Go now ! George ! I want to die here . No ! Get up ! I 've become a Galactor . The stone is still shining ! We still have hopes ! And you 're my dearest friend . I won 't let you die ! You must live on in place of Naomi ! You 're so stupid ... Haha ! Yes ! Stupid ! Finally ... Yes . Engine activated . Error occured ! Engine cannot be activated ! We can 't get out ! It 's still under testing . 1 : 30 minutes to launch . What do we do . The Bird Missile ! Activate the missile ! What are you doing ? You 're much clever than I thought . This is the only way . Change to battle mode , Ryu . Yes. I got it ! Monitor Phoenix ! Battle mode ! Battle mode ! Launch ! 49 % ! Launch ! 40 seconds to launch ! There 's still one more blow . What do we do ? Launch again , Ryu ! We 'll be together forever . Right , Jun ? The decision is in your hands ! We 'll just follow . Yes , me too ! Okay . Alright . Let 's go . It 's been concluded . Target corrected . Energy filled . Loading 60 % . 5 seconds to launch . Launch ! We did it ! This is Kagaku Ninpo : Hinotori ! Good job ! Did you hear that , Jinpei ? Ken said that he wants to be together with me forever . Of course I did . That 's my brother . I mean we 'll be together when we die . I didn 't say that especially to Jun. Geez ! Come on ! If it 's like that , I 'll steal your position as a Captain , and command you to date him out . You can 't refuse , Ken . This is great . That 's nonsense . They are the best ! Yes . Let 's go back . Roger !

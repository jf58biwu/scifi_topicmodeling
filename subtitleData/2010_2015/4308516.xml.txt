 My name is Anna . Don 't be frightened . We are of peace . Always . It is really important that you don 't get involved with the Visitors . A human is carrying a Visitor baby . I 'm pleased the baby survived . The mother , however , did not . You 're a Visitor . There 's others like me called the Fifth Column . Evans , I want you to investigate the Fifth Column . - We have to crush them . - We need more soldiers . An army . I 'll make one . Anna 's V-soldier eggs are about to hatch . I have a plan . There is a war at hand . Let V stand for victory . No ! You are experiencing human emotion . - Do you know what you 've done ? - They must pay . Ty ? Tyler ? Ty ? Ty ? Ty ? Tyler ! Tyler ! Tyler ? Tyler ? Hey , hey . Hey . Mom , what is this ? What did you do to us ? Ty ? Tyler ? Ty , Ty , no . No , Ty . No . Why did you do this ? You killed my children , so I killed yours . Virtually impossible in this situation . I just wanna make sure that if Forensics has new data , that we get it . Evans . Didn 't I send you home ? Go get some sleep . Four days since Red Sky , no bottom in sight , you expect me to go home ? - Anyone cleared a meeting with Anna ? - Negative . World leaders continue to reach out , but her majesty Anna remains silent . Guess on her planet that 's a show of power . Unfortunately , on ours , silence means guilt . There 's still no proof the Visitors are behind this . Either way , we need to get up there , talk to them , find out . The longer we wait to answer questions about Red Sky the sooner they could reach an answer . Even if the humans determine its composition they 'll never be able to discern its true purpose . Perhaps . However I 've monitored the work of their top environmental scientists . There is one , a Dr. Ellis Watts . His research is approaching dangerous proximity to the truth . Eliminate him . There is another matter to discuss . The captains of the 29 ships were caught off-guard by the sudden release of Red Sky . They 're concerned that you , yourself , have been affected by human emotion . That you 're losing control , your ability to rule effectively . Do you also feel that I 'm losing control , Marcus ? Of course not , my queen . Set up a holo-conference with the captains immediately . The captains are already en route . To see you in person . Notify me when they 've arrived . Yes ? My queen . There 's a situation with the prisoner . Don 't worry . I 'm gonna get you out of here . I promise . You disappoint me , Ryan . Even after you rebelled against me , I brought you back . I offered you everything . A home . I gave you bliss . Yet you continue to resist . I don 't want your bliss . - I just wanna see my daughter . - No . - You wanna take your daughter . - Away from this prison . Before you kill her just like you did her mother . You 've done nothing but run tests on me . Who knows what you 're doing to her ? I 'm just trying to discover how your daughter , a miracle the first hybrid baby between human and V , was born . She was born out of something you 'll never understand . Love . If it 's humans you love so much , you should be with them . Take him down to Earth . He 's never to return . - Your daughter stays with me . - No ... It 's been two months since the arrival of Anna and the Visitors . Earth 's first contact with alien life captured the hope and imagination of the entire world . But now a very different tone . Acceptance and gratitude over such gifts as Healing Centers and Blue Energy replaced by anger and civil unrest . Reports of rioting continue to flow in . And we 've now received word that officials in Washington are scrambling to mobilize the military in case of all-out war . Here on the streets of Manhattan some citizens have begun stocking up on food , water and medical supplies dreading that we may be inching closer to disaster . As a result of this , some have sought sanctuary in houses of worship praying for answers of any kind , from either God or Anna . In response to the rioting in the streets some citizens have begun stockpiling guns and ammunition . As one New Yorker remarked : " If Anna 's bringing Armageddon , I 'm going out fighting . " Eyewitnesses report that the Visitor Peace Ambassador Center has become a powder keg waiting to explode . As remaining Visitors on the ground , fearing for their safety board the last shuttles back to the mother ship it is safe to say that relations between Visitors and humans are all but shattered . And still , with no word from the Visitors and world leaders stymied by their silence the question remains , is there anyone who can stand up to Anna ? We 've gotta get to Anna . There 's nothing we can do . At least not through official channels . You know what ? You 're right . I 'm wrecked . I 'm gonna go home . I 'll do it on my own . Ryan Nichols has returned to Earth . You 're questioning why I released him . We tested him and found nothing . The answers we need about the hybrid lie in the child itself . - What if he joins Fifth Column ? - That 's exactly what I want him to do . His hatred towards me will drive him into the heart of the Fifth Column . Once there , we can use him to destroy them from within . He 's rebelled against you time and again . What makes you think you can control him this time ? We have his child . Four days and we still have no clue about Red Sky . The only one with answers is Anna . It 's not like we can just ring the lizard queen on her cell . " Hello , Anna . Fifth Column here . May we have a word ? " I need to get on that ship . It 's me . Ryan ? Where have you been ? We were worried . - I was up on the ship . - For four days ? Doing what , having a family reunion ? No , I was a prisoner . A soldier found Val , took her up to the mother ship . I did all I could . I went up there after her . Ryan , where 's Val ? Dead . I 'm sorry . - The baby ? - Anna 's got her . I tried to get her out , get her away . But Anna caught me and she threw me off the ship . Interesting story . What , he just shows up and we 're supposed to believe him ? If I 'd sold you out , V soldiers would have come through that door behind me . So she just let you go ? And now she wants nothing in return ? Yeah ? - Ty . - I 'm at the Peace Ambassador Center . - They 're rioting . - Stay put . I will be right there . There 's a riot at the Peace Ambassador Center . Tyler 's there . I understand there are questions amongst you regarding the release of the Red Sky . I assure you it was all part of my plan . And no one , human or Visitor can comprehend the magnitude of what is coming . There 's also concern that I 've been infected by the human skin . You have no cause for worry . I have everything under control . I am so appreciative of your trust . Your confidence . Your loyalty . I may wear this skin , but I never forget what we are beneath . Tyler ! Mom ? Mom , I was trying to get up on the ship to see Lisa . - It was the last shuttle up . - It 's okay . Stay with me . I 'm gonna get you out of here , okay ? Hey , hey , hey . Back off . Back off . Ty ! Tyler ! Tyler ! Tyler ! - Hey . - Mom , I 'm fine . It 's okay . Let me see . Let me see . Okay , look . You 're hurt . I 'm gonna get you help . Excuse me . Excuse me ! I 'm Erica Evans , FBI , Fifth Column Task Force . Anna knows me . This is my son , Tyler . He needs to get up on the ship . He needs medical attention . Anna will want to know . She will want to help him . Call her ! It 's okay , it 's okay . Stay back ! Agent Evans , I 've been authorized to bring your son up to the mother ship . No . He 's not going without me . Agent Evans , we have to go , now . Are you sure we 're gonna be okay , Father ? Yes . Yes , we 're gonna be ... - Please , take a seat . - Thank you , Father . What are you doing here ? Have you seen what it 's like outside ? The sky 's bleeding . I came to pray . You 're not welcome . Not after what you 've done . Wait . What do you want ? Redemption . I saw something on the ship . Anna 's torturing the live-aboards . With some kind of needle machine . They 're put into it and ... I helped get them up there . I promoted the Live Aboard program . People thought Healing Centers were safe because they saw my aneurism healed . News flash , Father , Anna gave me that aneurism . People trusted me and I used that trust exactly the way Anna wanted me to . I 'm not sure how I can help you , Chad . Or if I want to . Father , please . Give me another chance . To fight with the Fifth Column . You 're not just asking for another chance , Chad . You 're asking for forgiveness . Only God can offer you that . You want my trust ? Earn it . You 'll be okay . Thank you . - Mrs. Evans , is he all right ? - Don 't worry . Tyler will be fine . It looks worse than it is . I needed an excuse to get up on the ship to see you . What is happening ? First the sky turns red , now the rain . - What the hell is your mother doing ? - I don 't know . We need your help . Joshua was our most important ally on the ship . With him dead ... Without someone up here , the Fifth Column doesn 't stand a chance . The only one besides my mother who might know about the Red Sky is Marcus . See what you can find out . I 'll do my best , Mrs. Evans . Thank you . Mom , I 'm fine . You could 've been seriously hurt . We wanted to take all precautions . Leave nothing to chance . Thank you for letting him up on the ship . Every being in the universe understands a mother 's pain when a child suffers . You would 've done the same for my children . I would . There are other mothers down there , Anna . Excuse me ? Have you seen what 's happening down there ? People are panicking . My son took a blow to the head . The sky ... It 's raining red . The whole world needs answers . Why are you hiding ? I came here to check on your son , not to be questioned . Now that I know he 's okay ... Stop . Anna , my job is to protect you . How the hell am I supposed to do that if I don 't know what you 're doing ? You wanna know what Red Sky is ? I 'll show you . - When ? - Now . Please . Don 't be frightened . I 'm aware of your concerns . The time for answers has come . Red Sky and Red Rain are not to be feared . Just the opposite . Like the Healing Centers and Blue Energy . That is why I was forced to wait until I had proof . To show you what it truly is . Red Sky is a gift to mankind . A gift of a new beginning . Red Sky will heal your oceans make fertile your barren lands and reverse global warming . It will undo a century of damage , and give Earth a new beginning . We came in peace as you welcomed us . We will not betray you . We are of peace . Always . I hope your concerns have been addressed . They have , Anna . Thank you . Mom , don 't you think you should apologize to Anna ? No apology necessary , Erica . You 've been a good friend to me . Goodbye . Bye . Uh , we should go . Actually , I think I 'm gonna stay up here for a bit . Me and Lisa haven 't seen each other in a while , so ... Don 't worry , Erica . Next to my daughter , Tyler 's the most important thing to me . I 'll keep my eye on him . Okay . Have fun . Goodbye , Mrs. Evans . A scientist , Dr. Ellis Watts , at New York State University . - Bye , Lisa . - Goodbye . Lisa , a moment . You 're to perform your duties with Tyler . All of them . You haven 't seen each other for four days . Tyler should know how happy you are to see him . Of course , Mother . Well , that was one hell of a show Anna put on . Yeah . She 's covering up something big . Dr. Watts ' office is inside . He may know what it is . Be careful . If this guy 's on Anna 's radar we never know what we could be walking into . Stay outside , watch our backs , let us know if a tail shows up ? - Yeah . - Okay . Can I help you ? We 're looking for Dr. Watts . - Uh , sorry . He 's not here . - Do you know where he is ? Skies are blue . Check the putting green . I 'm his associate , Dr. Sidney Miller . Is there anything I can help you with ? Erica . He 's a tracker . He reports us back to Anna , it 's all over . Move ! - Whoa , whoa . Ease up . - Get off me , Hobbes ! Ryan . - What happened ? - Somebody 's got anger issues . What the hell was that ? That did not just happen . That was a Visitor . He 's after your boss , Dr. Watts . - I thought the Vs were of peace . - That 's what they want you to think . If that thing would 've gotten to your boss , there 'd be nothing left but pieces . That ... That thing , that Visitor . I don 't think it was after Dr. Watts . I think it was after me . We need to take this inside . Come on . Why do you think the Vs are after you and not Dr. Watts ? I think it 's just easier if I show you . Um , a few years ago I was on a research dig in New Mexico . Found a mass grave site , a crater loaded with bodies . Really creepy . Based on carbon dating , the site was 50 years old . All the bones I found were human . Except for these . I named him Alpha . Yeah , it 's one of us . Wow , that 's crazy . So that 's you underneath ? - I mean , is this a suit of some kind ? - No . The skin 's organic . It 's real . Just like yours . The Vs use the human DNA to replicate it so there 's no suspicion . Okay . Enough about this Visitor . Let 's talk about that one . Sure . I ran every test on him . DNA . Carbon dating . Everything I tried , it all came back inconclusive . I mean , my only theory was that it came from ... Does anybody else know about Alpha ? Or about this place ? Nobody . This is my private lab . All of this research . All of this information about the Visitors . We need him . Whoa , what ? What do you mean , need me ? Need me for what ? For the war . Against the Visitors . Everything that has happened since their arrival was plotted . The Healing Centers , the Blue Energy , it is all part of their plan against us . Red Sky is not Anna 's latest gift . It is her latest weapon . And we do need you . We need your help to figure out the truth . - Look , I 'm not a soldier . - I know . We don 't need your fists . We need your brain . And if you say no , we 'll kill you . Ah , relax . I 'm kidding . Maybe . Like it or not you 're one of us now . What is it , Chad ? Proof you can trust me . We need to show this to the people you 're working with . It first happened a few days after I arrived . On Live Aboard ? Yes . I was excited at first . We all were . But then the nightmares began . They were terrible . I know they were just dreams , but they felt so real . I couldn 't move . There , uh ... There were lights and needles . Hundreds of needles all over my body . I 've interviewed nearly 20 women , children too . Each of them experienced the very same nightmare . Every story exactly the same , all of them live-aboards . That 's the machine that I saw , Father . That 's what the Vs are doing to the live-aboards . To innocent people . Our people . And I 'm gonna stop it . How ? I 'm gonna broadcast this tape . I have to do something . What else am I supposed to do ? Use this , Father . Use me in your fight . - I really missed you . - Me too . My mother wouldn 't let me contact anyone . I know . I was just worried . I thought that maybe you didn 't wanna be with me anymore . Lisa has performed well . She 'll make an excellent queen . One day . Where are we with the next step of the plan ? Everything is back on track . But there is one matter we need to discuss . The soldiers , your children , who survived the Fifth Column bombing . Their condition has taken a turn . You need to see them . Soon , the levels of phosphorous in humans will be substantial enough . Red Sky may be gone but its impact will endure . Anna 's a lizard ? That sucks , she 's so hot . Sorry . I joke when I 'm nervous . Sid , I wanna get back to why the Visitors went after Dr. Watts and not you . Did he know about Alpha ? No . No one does . If I showed this thing to Watts , he 'd steal it or laugh me out of the room . So why was Watts on their radar ? The compound . In my tests , I discovered a compound in Alpha . Couldn 't identify it . Then , when Red Sky happened , that same compound showed up in it . I had to use a computer at Watts ' lab for the analysis . So I logged on using his ID . That 's why the Visitors thought it was Watts . Yeah . They must have thought it was his work . But he didn 't know what it was . No one does . Show us everything you have on the compound . Yeah , sure . Beats me what the hell it is . I just know it 's not from Earth . You 're right . It 's not . That compound is a form of phosphorous . A high concentrate , only found on our home planet . Why phosphorous ? The Vs need phosphorous to reproduce . It forms a protective shell around our eggs . Val needed it to ... To carry our baby . Anna dumps Red Rain on us , and now it 's in everything . The soil . The air we breathe . The water we drink . They 're changing our planet . They 're changing us . Our bodies . Why would the Visitors want elevated levels of phosphorous inside humans ? For breeding . So first they want to invade us , then they wanna shag us ? Erica , what 's wrong ? When I was pregnant with my son , I had preeclampsia . My doctor ran some tests and she found something that she had never seen before . I had abnormally high amounts of phosphorous in my blood . Ryan , you said that phosphorous allows the Visitors to breed . And Alpha is proof that the Visitors have been here for longer than we knew . So you don 't really think that ... What are you suggesting ? Is it possible the Visitors experimented on me when I was pregnant ? I don 't know . Well , how could you find out ? I 'd have to run some blood tests . On you and your son . Do it . You wanted to see me , Mother ? Your work with Tyler was very convincing . It is key , now more than ever , that you maintain your control over him . I understand . Tyler is essential to our future . No one must interfere . Neither human nor Visitor . Visitor ? There are traitors among us . But soon they won 't be a problem . Our medical technicians have revived Joshua . The traitor will finally be able to talk . The pain was horrible . Like nothing I 'd ever felt before . The needles . They just dug in , piercing . Chad Decker interviewed 20 live-aboards . Every one says the same thing . The live-aboards . The Vs are experimenting on them ? Chad wants to go public , expose Anna to the world . He wants to join . The best thing he can do is preserve his access to Anna . He 's closer to her than any human . We can use him . I don 't think he 's gonna do that . He 's terrified of her . What if it backfires ? Yeah , I don 't know . It 's a risk I 'm willing to take . My daughter 's up there . Ryan , we will do whatever it takes to find your daughter and to bring her back . I swear . I gotta go . - Can you let me out ? - Yeah . I 'm worried about him , Erica . - We can trust Ryan . - Yeah , I know . But ask yourself , what would you be willing to do for Tyler if Anna had him ? At some point Ryan 's gonna have to make a choice . His daughter or us . Joshua . You 're alive . I was afraid ... I don 't know if I can do this without you . Do what ? Lisa , this behavior isn 't befitting a future queen . Joshua , do you remember anything that happened to you ? That you were shot ? Any of it ? No . I remember nothing . More popular every day , Father . - You talked to the Fifth Column ? - You can 't broadcast that report , Chad . So I 'm supposed to do what ? Sit back and do nothing ? While more innocent people get hurt ? - I have to expose them . - And then what ? The mother ships can overpower our military in the blink of an eye . We need to be strategic . When we throw our punch , it needs to be a knockout blow . Okay , so then you tell me how I can help take Anna down . By keeping your relationship with her . I can 't do that . Not after knowing what I know . You have access to Anna and the ship . None of us do . We need you up there . As a spy ? As a member of the Fifth Column . This is what you wanted . Are you ready ? Of the 12 soldiers that survived the bombing , only six remain . Their core temperatures are stabilized but the trauma they sustained was great . They 'll live , but they will be flawed . These soldiers , my children caused my prior outburst of emotion . Never again . Hello , Mother .

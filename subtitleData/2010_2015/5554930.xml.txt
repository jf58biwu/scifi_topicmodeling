 Is it programmable matter ? Technically , sure . But then , so is a liquid crystal display . Which was also a breakthrough and also thought to be as inconceivable as claytronics . Olivia ... Your encouragement is much appreciated . I think I 'm gonna grab a coffee . Yes . Um ... Of course . I have a big day tomorrow . - Bye . - Bye . [ Cellphone rings ] Hello ? Professor Donovan ? Chris ! Chris . 25-year-old male , shallow breath , widespread internal hemorrhaging . [ Voice breaking ] He hasn 't stopped bleeding . O2 ... 10 liters . 125 of methylprednisolone , I.V. Push . Let 's get him on the table . - What 's his name ? - Dr. Chris Donovan . What kind of doctor is he ? He works with artificial intelligence ... robotics . What 's wrong with him ? Oh , God ! Damn , Jenny . Just plug it . His blood ... It 's moving . This is a cellphone video taken by an emergency-room technician at a hospital in Pittsburgh last night . - What am I looking at ? - Nanites . Highly advanced robotics on a microscopic scale . Nanite technology has not advanced this far . This is a ... A scientific impossibility . So is a microchip in the brain . They somehow got into this man 's bloodstream causing massive internal bleeding . And who 's the victim ? Dr. Chris Donovan , one of the nation 's premier experts on ... Artificial intelligence . I knew Chris . Shen , I 'm so sorry . It gets worse , unfortunately . Dr. Ezby Grant of Portland , Oregon , Dr. Horatio Cameron of Dallas , Texas ... Both dead in the past 24 hours . There are two more in Europe and South America that seem to match ... Elian Vega and Susanna Delacroix . [ Voice breaking ] Delacroix ? [ Pats back ] Scientists working with bio-inspired robotics is a really ... Small circle . They 're not just scientists , son . They 're giants . Their loss is incalculable . Is the CDC involved ? No , nanites are not a contagion . What we are dealing with are intelligent machines programmed to kill . Okay , look , the first thing we need to do is find out how the nanites are being distributed , right ? We need to trace them to their original source . Until that happens , we should isolate any of the doctors , the E.R. staffs ... Anyone who has been in potential contact with these victims . I 'll institute a full quarantine . You said the scientists work in small circles . Any chance they traveled to the same location ? Maybe a conference or something ? Accessing passports and e-mails . No conferences , but I 'm looking through crime photos , and I did find a link . They each received identical packages ... Small yellow boxes , minimum postage , which means they 're nearly weightless . Chris had an open one in his office . No return address , I 'm assuming . No . Without being able to I.D. the sender , it 's impossible to know how many more packages are in transit . We should send a team out to the doc 's house , check his mail . - My mail ? - Gabriel 's right . If they 're targeting giants in the field , you 're certain to be on that list . Which is why you 're not leaving this facility until we find who 's responsible for slaughtering the great scientists of our time . Gabriel Vaughn . One of our nation 's most decorated soldiers . He 's a hero , and now our country 's most secret weapon . Gabriel possesses a rare genetic mutation that allowed us to implant a microchip in his brain . We connected his mind directly to the information grid . It 's something the chip does that nobody expected . I can create a virtual snapshot of an event in my mind and then walk through it . It 's like a virtual evidence wall . At U.S. Cyber Command , we created a highly specialized unit around him ... Satellite in five . And assigned an agent to protect him . Gun ! He 's the first of his kind ... the next evolution of intelligence . - Sync and corrections by Zac - - Web dl sync snarry - Intelligence 1x07 Size Matters Are we crowding you ? You just tell us if we 're crowding you . I could do with a tad less heavy breathing . - Thank you . - Guys , stop breathing . They look like ... Bugs . More like a monster-truck rally . I would love to browse the patent portfolio behind all this . You really think whoever designed these nanites applied for a patent ? If they didn 't , they should have . It 'd be worth a fortune . Why does every advancement in technology end up being used in anger or for violence ? I don 't [ Clears throat ] mean you , obviously . If the chip fits ... [ Door opens ] I searched the list of potential targets you gave me , Nelson , including your father , and I put all the local post offices on alert . But ... ? One box managed to slip through . - Who 's the recipient ? - Bryce Tyler . Bryce ? Oh , God . He was one of my dad 's protégés . He wrote the book " Warp Evolution " about the merge of man and machine , transhumanism , the singularity . He was the most ambitious student I ever had . Please , you have got to reach him . Don 't worry , doc . We 'll get to it . ♪ ♪ [ Telephone ringing ] Nobody 's answering the phone in Bryce 's office , and he 's still not picking up his cellphone . It 's still early . He might not be in yet . ♪ ♪ He 's got his cellphone on " silent . " I 'm changing the setting . Making the call now . [ Ringing ] [ Cellphone ringing ] [ Cellphone beeps ] Yes ? Bryce Tyler ? My name is Gabriel Vaughn . I 'm a friend of Shenandoah Cassidy 's , and I work at U.S. Cyber Command . I need you to listen carefully . Cyber Command ? What 's this about ? I 'll explain more when we get there . There 's been a credible threat to your life . Do not open any packages that come to you . Oh , no . My assistant . [ Beep ] Hello ? Dr. Tyler ? [ Tires screech , engine revs ] ♪ ♪ [ Cellphone ringing ] [ Cellphone beeps ] Mr. Tyler ? Why are you calling my cell ? Audrie , do not open any package addressed to me . Understand ? Why not ? Just put them on . We still don 't know how the nanites are spread . [ Gasps ] No . Wait . She 's dead . [ Sighs ] Nanites are meant to cure world hunger , attack cancer , create fuel . But this is ... Someone with a different idea . Which is why we need to concentrate our efforts , Bryce . To stop them . [ Pats back ] Okay ? That 's why you 're here . Now , come on . Now , the nanites were delivered in the box in the form of a dust . Open the box , and the dust is released . So they 're airborne . Right . But since we don 't have a long list of dead doctors , nurses , or mailmen , we 're assuming the nanites were programmed somehow to only attack their targets . But we haven 't caught one alive long enough to study it . How can they be alive ? Well , obviously , they 're not completely organic . They seem to enjoy a capacity for growth . Apparently , they have a purpose . Combine that with the element of intelligence , artificial or not , and I defy you to tell me the distinction between a living organism and these remarkable creatures . Tell us what you see . It 's more your area than it is mine . Uh , encapsulated in polymer , CMOS front end , piezo core . But this particle size is leaps beyond anything we 're doing in my company . Whoever did this knows their business . Huh . Wait till you see the note . It 's a simple binary code . Has anybody translated it ? " Welcome to the future . " Whoever had the ability to do this knows how to hide himself . Whoever had the ability to do this does not want to hide . What do you mean ? Someone with a mind this twisted doesn 't want to be in the shadows for long . They want to be famous . They want us to know why . Yes , of course . Can I use your electron microscope ? Sure . Why ? We 're not thinking small enough . This is the letter the killer left us . On the surface , it 's binary code , a series of 1s and 0s , a single hidden message , " Welcome to the future " ... At least , that 's what we thought . Right ... now check out what we see when it 's magnified by 200 nanometers . There 's text embedded inside each typewritten number . This is a manifesto . Yeah . We see a lot of these loon letters at secret service . Angry guy with a lot to say . " A lot " is right . How about 300 pages of text ? I want to see the whole document . Can you extract it ? Yeah . What are you doing ? Reading . 35,000 words ? I 'm skimming . Look at the phraseology . There should be a pattern . Then locate documents where certain word groupings have been used before . Nelson , can you run a program like that or something ? Uh ... I-I ... yes . I can ... Do that ... Here . [ Keyboard clacking ] " Evolution is earth 's deepest breath . Technolution , its dying gasp . " Poetic . He 's repeated it on at least six anti-government , anti-education , and conspiracy websites . There are other matches , too . Do you have a name ? User name belongs to a Gordon Greyson . Gordon Greyson ? Oh , yeah . This guy 's the real deal . NSA watchlist , TSA no-fly . He 's corresponded with at least four of the five victims . How could you know that ? Well , ' cause he 's looking at my screen . I have all the e-mails pulled up . Do we have an address ? Uh ... No . This guy 's careful . He 's I.P.-Ghosting all over the place . I got him . He 's in an industrial area in Baltimore . What is he ? [ Sighs ] Excuse me ? [ Chuckling ] You ... You finally did it , didn 't you ? [ Chuckling ] Did what ? You overcame your fear of what might happen ... Or you were convinced . Dr. Cassidy , would you please escort Dr. Tyler out of here ? How much of him is organic ... human ? Sorry to disappoint you , but I 'm all human . No , you 're not ... Not all human . Dr. Cassidy . Bryce , please come with me . Embrace what you are . - Bryce , that 's enough . - And what am I ? The future . Don 't tell me you let that guy get under your skin . It 's not skin . It 's more like ... Leatherette . [ Chuckles ] I refuse to accept that leatherette is the future . You watched the title fight on pay-per-view Saturday night . And in the morning , you had a soy latte after your run . How do you know it was after and not before ? 'Cause you checked your e-mail at 6 : 00 A.M. from your apartment and again an hour later from your phone on the other side of Rock Creek Park . I 'm just saying it 'd be nice to come in Monday morning and not already know what you did all weekend . You knew I had a soy latte because you know me . It 's not the chip . This is the place . I don 't like this without a full tac team . If we 're ever gonna find out what other packages are already out there , we need this guy alive . Sometimes tac teams aren 't so good at that . [ Gearshift clicks , engine shuts off ] Neither are you . Greyson last accessed the internet from here this morning . The building 's lined with wire mesh . I can 't chip any of the systems inside ... at least not clearly . So he could have eyes on us and we can 't see him ? Great . Any ideas on a way in ? That ladder activates in case of a fire . [ Sighs ] Camera . Can you chip it ? No . It 's heavily encrypted . Guess we 're gonna have to do this like normal people . [ Sighs ] Move . Gabriel . [ Sighs ] Check the handwriting . Is this our guy ? Matches the manifesto . He 's our guy . Greyson ! Stop right there ! Put the gun down now . [ Gun clatters ] Now turn around slowly . If you 're really gonna take me in , I 'd at least like to know who you are . U.S. Cyber Command . I would have thought CIA or FBI . But that actually makes more sense . Meet and greet 's over . Now get on the ground . Why ? So you can put me in some deep , dark hole ? Exactly . [ Chuckles ] That would be a little redundant . What are you talking about ? Oh , I have a hole of my own . No . [ Grunts ] It 's booby-trapped . He just activated some kind of I.E.D. I 'm pulling up diagrams of the warehouse and the city 's underground rail road tunnels . As in the underground railroad ? This place was built on the site of an original slave market . Looks like the tunnels lead into the city 's sewage system about 200 yards from here . [ Engine turns over ] - Turn here . - You sure ? That tunnel back at the warehouse leads to two others . I think one of them 's filled with water . This will be his only way out . There . [ Tires screech ] This area 's wide open . He couldn 't have got far on foot . He had a vehicle waiting . Tire tracks lead that way . He 's got a head start on us . He was definitely prepared . I 'll give him that . I 'm in the treadmaster national database . It 's a pickup , late model , bias ply , O-8 tires , probably American . Wheelbase is pretty narrow . I 'd say it 's a Ford . My little brother 's a gearhead . Let 's go . I 'm in the DMV database checking late-model Ford pickups in Baltimore . Nothing registered to the name Gordon Greyson . I 'm looking at known aliases right now . There 's nothing . This guy 's doing everything to stay off the grid . There 's no way he 's gonna fill out a credit report to buy a car . He 'd pay cash . Check with the I.R.S. Cross-reference with local dealers . What am I looking for ? Form 83-100s filed in connection with the purchase of a Ford pickup in the last 10 years . Right ... Dealer would be required to file an 83-100 with internal revenue . It 's a money-laundering thing . Got it . 2005 Ford F-150 registered in his mother 's maiden name . Jameson , we need eyes on that truck . I got D.C. sat coverage moving into position any second . Checking a 2-mile radius from the tunnel . Hold on . Found a match . All right , do you see it ? It 's on the move ... Heading northwest . I 'm gonna chip the traffic lights just ahead of him . [ Tires screech ] Greyson ! Don 't move ! [ Groans ] You people think you can shut me up , but you can 't . Don 't worry . I 'll let you talk all you want . Can you tell me exactly what my crime is ? - You 're a terrorist . - A terrorist ? A term as lazy as it is overused . " The architects of human extinction must be struck down . " you are taking my words out of context . I 've never advocated violence ... never . Funny , coming from a guy that just shot at federal agents . You ... You were trespassing . The second amendment affords me the right to shoot and kill ... I 'm sorry ... Is it the right to program nanites to kill scientists you don 't like ? Nanites ? Where are the other packages ? Who else did you send them to ? I don 't send packages . I send letters ... Warnings about the consequences of their work . Like this ? " Dormitories of mediocre minds filled with insidious promises and empty lies . " So , that 's the great Gordon Greyson . [ Scoffs ] Incredible . He was working with nano-technology when it was in its infancy . You two talk as though he 's to be admired . Once upon a time , Lillian , that man inspired a generation . Right ? Yeah . 'Till he got scared . What do you mean , scared ? Greyson claimed he 'd developed an algorithm which could conceivably make artificial intelligence autonomous . Now , in all our simulations of the human mind , what limits us is the ability of the computer to program itself . So if that were possible , so the theory goes , we ... meaning people ... Well , we suddenly become unnecessary . It 's called transhumanism ... The biological synthesis between man and technology . And it 's nothing to be afraid of . Your ... Creation is certainly proof of that . Gabriel is not what you think he is . And he 's certainly not my " creation . " If you say so . [ Clears throat ] These scientists , these people that you killed , they had families . They were mothers and they were fathers . Look , if ... if ... If nanites did this , they are creating their own end . You 're blaming them ? I-I-I ... I-I want you to imagine a machine devoid of humanity , able to learn on its own , create on its own . But how do you control it ? How do you reason with it when it 's thinking in ways that we can 't even comprehend ? I blame them ... I blame them for their insatiable hunger for technology . I blame the government . The people that you work for ... They are the real terrorists . You realize you 're nuts , right ? No , the government ... The government is trying to plant chips into our minds , into our heads . It 's true even if you don 't believe it . It 's true . I swear it ... Trust me when I tell you this . Frankenstein 's monster will walk among us . And when he does , the world will be no more ready for him now than they were then . And this , this , this , and this is proof of it . We 're not getting anywhere . What the hell is he doing ? Did he just turn the cameras off ? Come on . What did you just do ? Meet Frankenstein . What ? What are you talking about ? There 's a little red barn in Alton , Kansas , with two silos . You use it as your dead drop ever since you went awol . And your I.P. address that ghosts your anonymity is pinging off a serbian server right now . But you never send any e-mails , do you ? You just read the ones from your sister , Emma ... The same ones over and over again so you don 't feel so alone . Everything you predicted in your little manifesto here is standing right in front of you . No . I don 't believe you . " There will come a point in which there will be so much data , man will need to augment the human mind just to process it . " The singularity . You ? No . It 's not possible . You 're gonna tell us where the rest of those packages are in the next 30 seconds ... [ Cellphone vibrates ] Or everything you 've ever been afraid of is about to happen . I don 't know . I swear to you . I don 't know . [ Gasps ] Gabriel ? Aah ! No . Oh , God ! I 'm bleeding ! No . No . - What 's happening to him ? - I don 't know . [ Alarm blaring ] Hang on . [ Sighs ] What happened in that room when you turned off the camera ? Nothing . I was just trying to freak him out a little bit ... Shake something loose . You shook something loose , all right . Hey . I didn 't make him go all Niagara like that . Gabriel , there is a reason that we have surveillance in that room . You 're not so special that you can disregard standards and protocols . Standards ? I just watched a guy implode because microscopic robots ate his flesh . That 's not standard . That 's a freak show . Consider yourself lucky . You have your own freak . Yes , I feel very lucky . [ Sighs ] What ? I don 't like you calling yourself a freak . The youngest one 's always a freak . I was the only one my mother forbid from joining the army . Well , if she could see you now . She 'd probably have another breakdown . I 'll be lucky if I don 't have a breakdown . Probably millions of them on this gauze alone . Just think ... I could have gone my whole life without seeing something this ... Disturbing . Thank you for this , dad . Yeah , I knew you wouldn 't want to miss a chance to study the nanites up close . I was employing sarcasm . Never mind . [ Whirring ] - Oh , what the ... ? - Electron magnet . We 're gonna pull the little bastards out of his arm . Just think ... Greyson develops one of the most elegant , undetectable microscopic weapons of the century and then dies of his own creation the moment we catch him . Well , that would be poetic , except now he can 't tell us what the rest of his plan was , now , can he ? True . [ Clears throat ] Would you like to take the sample from his nasal cavity ? Oh , that sounds ... awesome , but I am gonna pass . [ Sighs ] Dad , why are we wearing these suits if the nanites are dead ? The ones in his body are dead . Are you saying there are others ? Well , he must have been infected at some point . It stands to reason he was carrying them around on his person somewhere . Or he was infected before he came in here . No , because in the other cases , the victim died quickly . Greyson was here for , uh ... whew ... About three hours before ... Before ... - Oh , hell . You 're right . - I am ? He wasn 't infected here . Well , then how could he poss ... No , we 're thinking about this all wrong . We 're treating this like it is an organic infection . What we are dealing with is a mechanical infection . Viruses and bacteria are active before they enter the body . But a machine can be turned on at any time . All right , good . Let 's get out of here . This is ... That 's disgusting . He was capable of it . He was brilliant . He was crazy . What if he isn 't guilty ? What if Gordon is just a patsy for somebody else ? Go on . The nanites that killed Greyson , they could have been in his system for hours , days , even weeks . The only reason he died when he did is because at that exact moment , someone else activated them . - Remotely . - Activated ? How ? They 're digital creatures . They can communicate with each other , and they can be made to communicate with whatever controls them . I never picked up a signal . You also can 't hear a dog whistle . The signal the nanites are receiving would be on a very special spectrum . Your chip wasn 't programmed to access it . How was the signal sent ? It 's called an S.A.R. signal , and you could piggyback it on a cell signal . The nanites take phone calls ? Uh-huh . The call would have to be cellphone to cellphone , but the nanites , they just have to be in the vicinity ... [ Snaps fingers ] ... To be triggered . My cellphone buzzed during the interrogation . It was a blocked number . Yes , yes . That must have been when the nanites were activated . But no cellphone from the outside can penetrate our shielding . Maybe he wasn 't outside . - Are you kidding me ? - You son of a bitch . We gave him complete access to this building . No . I gave him access . Come on . Let 's go . Bryce selected Greyson because he matched the profile of what we 'd be looking for ... Anti-government paranoia , a history of violence . He planted Greyson 's manifesto under each letter to seal the deal . This man sent a package to his own office , killed an innocent girl to throw us off . So be cautious . There 's no telling what he 's capable of . It 's over , Bryce . - Your phone . - I don 't understand . No more games . Where 's your phone ? Why do you need my phone ? This phone has never accessed the deep net . - He used a burner phone . - Where is it ? [ Timer beeping ] [ Cellphone ringing ] Dad , your phone 's ringing . [ Ringing continues ] What ? Not my phone . How did this happen ? Bryce infected my dad with nanites . Then he planted a cellphone in the lab to activate them . - You got this ? - Are you in pain , Shen ? Yep . [ Whirring ] Okay , this electron magnet should slow down the nanites . - Possibly . - Probably ! Just ... Probably . - Okay , you ready , dad ? - Yeah . Turn it on . [ Whirring ] It appears to be working . Nice job , Nelson . Now , this will only delay them . These nanites , t-they 're smart . They 'll adapt . Once they adapt , they 'll pick up speed and get right back to ... Killing me , yeah . This is merely slowing down the death process . Well ... At least I won 't be the first scientist to be ironically felled by science , huh ? Madame Curie died of radiation poisoning shortly after discovering radium . Dad ! [ Chuckles ] Lighten up , Nelson . You love a good joke when you 're nervous . Well , you need better material . [ Monitor beeping steadily ] Someday you 'll have a child of your own . You 'll see what it feels like to be as ... As proud as I am . I just wish I could have met him . Or ... or her . [ Chuckles ] Okay , look , I like the jokes . Let 's just get back to the jokes . [ Sniffles ] - Gabriel ? - I 'm here , doc . I cannot imagine what I will be missing with you , what you 'll become . [ Chuckles ] You can cut that out right now , doc . The Cassidy I know doesn 't give up . Look at me . This is not goodbye . Just know that I could not have chosen a better candidate ... A better man . [ Grunts ] He 's bleeding ! There 's got to be some way we can treat him ! This is not a disease , okay ? He 's being attacked by microscopic A.I. He doesn 't need a doctor ! He needs me ! [ Monitor beeping rapidly ] He needs you ! Bryce is in holding . I 'm gonna make him fix this . Hang on . [ Gasps ] How do we deactivate the nanites ? Tell me ... what do you see when you look at me ? - Data streams ? - Just a murderer . Tell us how to stop the nanites , and we 'll see to it that you 're tried in Maryland , where there 's no death penalty . [ Smacks lips ] You know , any futurist will tell you that the world doesn 't advance by a cacophony of voices but evolves only through a singular vision . One man ... Henry Ford , Steve Jobs , Bill Gates . Bin Laden . This isn 't about a vision of the future . It 's about a vision of your bank account . You 're eliminating competition . Are you just guessing that ? Or is that your chip telling you ? It must be difficult for you to reconcile the two . [ Chuckles ] Not really . They 're both telling me to kick your ass right now . You 're quite a curiosity . You are so average , but your augmented mind is extraordinary . We 're not even the same species . - No , you 're not . - Gabriel is warm-blooded . Warm-blooded . We got to get up to the lab . I think I know what to do . That 's your plan ... To kill my dad ? The nanites just have to think he 's dead . You said they can only live outside the body for a few minutes , which is why you couldn 't catch them alive . That has to be temperature . Yes . Yes , yes , yes . When one dies , they all die . It 's called swarm intelligence . So we lower his body temperature to simulate a clinical death . Make the nanites think their job is done . [ Monitor beeping rapidly ] You okay , doc ? He could really die from this . I know . His temperature dropped to 93 degrees . Okay , he 's gonna need a fast active-core rewarm . On my signal , you pump him with this . How are we gonna know they 're dead if Gabriel can 't access the S.A.R. signal ? - Electron magnet . - What about it ? It 's hooked up to the computer , which means you can chip it . Okay , use it for imaging , like an MRI . Hurry , Gabriel . His body 's shutting down . At what point does he enter hypothermia ? We 're past that already . I can see them . They 're still alive . - Nelson . - Dad ? [ Beeping quickens ] Dad . He 's shutting down . Gabriel ! Not yet . They 're slowing . Do you want me to give him the adrenaline ? No ! No . I 'll ... I 'll do it . Just ... just hold him down . He 's gonna seize . Hey , hey . Now ? Not yet . We 're gonna lose him . [ Flatline ] Wait . Now , Nelson ! Give him the shot now ! Go , go , go ! [ Flatline continues ] Come on , dad ! Come on ! Come on , dad ! Come on ! Come on ! Don 't give up on us , doc ! [ Flatline continues ] Come on . [ Flatline continues ] [ Monitor beeps ] Okay . [ Monitor beeping steadily ] [ Sobs ] [ Footsteps approach ] Glad to see you 're okay , old friend . Are you ? I 'm not the one you want . [ Groans ] You made a call to your assistant right before she died . I was trying to ... Warn her not to open the package . Oddly , you called her cellphone , not the office line . [ Chuckles ] So what ? Well , we examined the phone . When you dial a specific sequence of numbers before the call , it sends the required S.A.R. signal ... The one that triggers the nanites . You 're wrong . Well , we 're gonna find out . [ Clears throat ] The post office found another box . A-a-are you crazy ? These nanites can kill you , too . You programmed them to make one lethal attack , like a bee with one stinger . Let 's see who will get stung . So ... Go ahead , Bryce . Breathe it in . Ah . And now , that sequence was ... 7 ... [ Cellphone beeps ] [ Cellphone beeps ] 4 ... [ Cellphone beeps ] ... 7 ... [ Cellphone beeps ] ... 7 ... 4 ... Don 't ! [ Sighs ] Don 't . [ Grunts ] Powdered sugar . [ Lid closes ] You were one of my favorite students , Bryce . But you were never the brightest , and you were certainly never a visionary . I guess that 's why you had to murder all of your competition in order to succeed . [ Door slams ] [ Speed-dialing ] [ Ringing ] [ Cellphone ringing ] [ Cellphone beeps ] Yes ? Hey . Uh , we 're way past our nightly check-in . The sun is almost coming up . Did you want to ... Borrow a cup of sugar ? Maybe . Well , actually , I was just ... Calling to say thank you . What for ? You know what for . You know , Lillian told me once that ... We were defined by the decisions we make . Robots don 't make decisions . They execute code . You make decisions , Gabriel . And , from where I sit ... They 're pretty good ones . [ Sighs ] Okay , well ... I have a decision for you to make . Shoot . Paco 's for bacon and waffles . [ Chuckles ] I need sleep . And sleep would make sense if you 're 90 . Come on . Downstairs in 10 . Five . - sync and corrections by Zac - - web dl sync snarry -

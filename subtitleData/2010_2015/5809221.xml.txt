 So you 're saying in some past life , you and Irisa removed the keys to the ship ? Past lives ... maybe our ancestors ? I don 't really understand it . All I know is they scuttled the Kaziri and saved humanity . Oh , stupid bags . This is crazy . Here , let me help . Hey , what are you doing ? What was that for ? A savior ought to travel light . I never claimed to be a savior . These ... Ow ! These visions , they could be fantasies . I don 't think so . That ship that 's controlling Irisa is scared of you , which means you are a threat . How could I be a threat to a big , scary spaceship ? All right . Having both the keys inside Irisa reactivated the Kaziri . We need to separate the keys . Separate ? Separate how ? Same your ancestor did . By putting one inside me ? No way . Let me break this down for you . You can come with me willingly , or you can come strapped to the hood of my roller . Either way , you 're gonna help me stop my daughter . Stop her ? I thought we were trying to help her . Stop her from doing what ? Here , you want this ? Come and get it . Here , here . Andina , right ? Yes , Favi Datak . Welcome home . Where is my wife ? She 's entertaining Favi Christie 's mother . If you think I 'm gonna let some snooty shanje stick insect raise my family , you are crazy . You gave up any claim to parenting when you left Defiance . Is there a problem ? Datak . Welcome home , my love . You remember Pilar , Rafe 's wife . I do . She was something of a junkie for the mood stabilizers I would procure for her back in the old days . That was a long time ago . I 'm much better now . Good . Well , I would hate to return after a long absence to find you insulting my wife in our own home . It might lead me to extreme actions . No offense was taken , my love . Pilar was merely asking if we might allow Alak and Christie to live under her roof for a while . I 'm afraid my answer disappointed her . Well , that is a shame . Well , while I 've been gone , you two have carved out quite the niche for yourselves . I 've asked around . You know , some people find you scary . I don 't , of course . I think you 're a carnival act . Funny little white-faced clowns . I remember when Datak used to do card tricks for old-earth dollars . You , Stahma , you were a housemaid . Do you remember that one time when our regular maid was sick and you came over and cleaned my toilets ? You had a gift . As you say , that was a long time ago . Now your beautiful home belongs to the Earth Republic , your wealthy husband is in prison , and your daughter 's love is mine . Nothing remains for you here . Take your unfortunate son and leave our town . I won 't warn you twice . You know , she blew my husband . Just thought you should know . She 's lying , of course . Of course . Welcome home , hanizu . E-rats a bit jumpy today . New York 's been radio silent all morning . They 're saying it 's probably just a defective relay station , but it 's got the E-rats spooked . Animals . Have you two really considered the future ? In what way ? Defiance used to be a free city . Now it 's a satellite of the Earth Republic . Dad says that 's temporary . Dad 's in an E-Rep jail . Quentin , don 't talk with your mouth full . No matter what the propaganda says , the E-Rep has always been about Human primacy . Mixed-species children are treated like second-class citizens . The Votanis Collective isn 't any better . There are seven races of Votans . They 've been forced to deal with one another for thousands of years . The Votans understand the value of assimilation . I could show you . Show us what ? There 's a Harmony Collective . South of here , maybe 300 klicks past Cedars ... Humans and Votans living side by side . It 's everything that Defiance was supposed to be . Plenty of mixed-species children so the baby won 't feel like an outcast . Why have I never heard of this place ? It 's also a research facility . Some of the tech they use there is classified . For example , they breed horses there . Horses ? Seriously ? That 's impossible . All the horses died in the plagues . Indogene technology brought them back . Six weeks ago , I rode a palomino mare . Gorgeous , indescribable . Do you want to ride her ? I would love to ride a horse . But I don 't want to give you the wrong idea . Our home is here . Well , just for an overnight . A visit . And if you like it there , then we can talk about staying longer-term . You expect us to , what , just abandon my mother ? No . I 'm sure we could work something out . And I assume your dad will want to come too , since he 's moved back in . He ... Well , maybe your mother wanted to surprise you . Excuse me . Could you excuse us , please ? Sure , honey . I 'll get the check . There is no commune , is there ? You made that whole thing up . Pay the bill , genius . Mmm ... Why is he here ? Your father and I have decided to move forward . Together . As a family . After everything he 's done ? All my misdeeds are behind us , hanya tavo . I 'm not your hanya tavo . Let us look to the future , one that would be incomplete without the family together . Our family ? You mean the one you scarred and tried to drown ? Are you aware of how much pain you 've caused ? Well , it 's not like I dropped a whore from the top of the gateway arch , now , is it ? _ _ Christie . I 'm sorry . That was ... thank you for that . Just ... I appreciate it . Father of the year . Could you make this any more difficult ? I meant it as a joke . I ... I thought it was funny . You okay , boss ? New York 's gone dark . The relay posts are receiving dead air . There 's no chatter of any kind . We 're hoping it 's a technical glitch . What 's this for ? Berlin , what is it ? What 's wrong ? Tommy 's dead . What ? How ? Irisa . She killed him . - She wouldn 't . - Ho ho . Nolan says it 's not her fault , that she 's not acting like herself . But , see , I don 't believe that because Tommy knew that she was dangerous and ... He didn 't want her anywhere near me . He knew . Sorry . I don 't know what to say . I can 't believe it . And that 's confirmed ? What ? What just happened ? New York 's gone . Madame Mayor . We got the news on the trip back to New York . Defiance was the closest town . We 're setting up a command center in mayor Pottinger 's office , and I 'd like you to join . Captain , have you been drinking ? Yes , sir . You might want to gargle . Amanda , you 're with me . Something 's up . Come on . Come on . Nope , I don 't believe it . Only the Votanis Collective has the firepower to terraform the entire city . Clearly , we 're at war . I 'm telling you , Irisa is the key . And that arkbrain that 's controlling her has no intention of stopping with New York . For the moment , let 's assume we 're buying your story . What 's your plan ? We need to get this man next to Irisa . This guy ? He can extract the tech that 's controlling Irisa . Whenever I was near her , I could feel something pulling at me . It felt as though one of the pieces of tech wants me . I mean , to be inside me . That 's not coming out right . I ... Look , you know Colonel Marsh has a sealed file on Irisa . Unseal it . It 'll back up everything I 'm saying . Classified files are kept in New York , which proves somewhat inconvenient . Actually , I believe Mr. Nolan . Votan-controlled Belize just went dark . The Votans would never strike their own people . What I have trouble believing is that you knew this girl was on the watch list , and you gave her a badge . Would you care to explain that ? He did it for me . Jesus , Niles . Can 't you just pay for sex like a normal person ? I did it because Amanda believed it was best for the town ... and I trust her judgment . And I would make the same decision again and again and again . I think you should leave . With pleasure . Hold it right there ! On your knees ! - Go ! - On your knees ! Don 't move a muscle . There 's no need to fire , boys . I 'm unarmed . I need you to take me to your commanding officer immediately . There 's an extremely powerful sentient computer that intends to destroy the planet . That 's the bad news . Good news is I know how to kill it . Congratulations , Doctor . You 're no longer a war criminal . Your turn now . You believe you can stop Irisa ? I 've been inside the ship that 's controlling her . I got my hands on some higher cognitive data crystals . I can introduce a virus that will order the arkbrain fragments inside of Irisa to self-detonate . - Is that gonna hurt her ? - Brief , intense flash of pain . - Her death will transmit the ... - Whoa , hold on . Infected fragments back to the Kaziri and kill it . You are not to go anywhere near my daughter . - Terraforming will end . - Do you understand me ? Oh , I 'm sorry . I thought we were all serious about saving the planet . My bad . I can do this without bloodshed . What do you need to make this happen ? An hour in my lab . Sir , this woman is a liar . You can 't trust her . My plan will work . Amanda , tell him . If Yewll thinks that she can save her skin by killing Irisa and saving the planet , then that 's exactly what she would do . Amanda , escort the good doctor to her lab . If she gets tricky , you can kill her . No , hold on . I said hold on ! I hope you 'll forgive me for this . Forgive you for what ? Nolan needs to be locked up . He 'll never let us do what has to be done . No , no , no . Hey , hey , hey , hey . Sir , no , look . I 'm a realist , okay . I understand . I do . I get it . The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few and all that ... I understand . All right . Now we walk out of here nice and easy . Nolan . Oh , come on . Really ? Is that a letter opener ? It 's a popular weapon in this office . Don 't make me use it . Empty threat , sweetheart . You 'd never kill an innocent kid . Sure I will . I 'll stab this kid in the throat , your rescue plan will go down the tubes , and you 'll be forced to play it our way . It 's an attractive option . It 's up to you to come up with something better . Take them both into custody . Yes , sir . I trusted you . I know . - Why a rifle ? - Dangerous to get too close . Irisa catches you sneaking up behind her , she 'll bring an ark down on your head . Our snipers are on the first transport out . I 'll radio for them to circle back . I can do it . Are you sure ? - I 'm an excellent shot . - Better be . Oh , you 'll find out soon enough . Okay , can I explain myself ? You want to explain why you genetically modified a crazed Indogene to impersonate my sister ? - Yeah , I 'd like to hear that . - Now is not the time for this . - We need to be focusing ... - Now is exactly the time . Nobody wants to hear another word out of your lying mouth . I have finished creating this superweapon . There is nothing stopping Amanda from putting a bullet in my head . I 'll put one in you right now . If there 's an explanation , I want to hear it , now . I was sick in Camp Reverie . Starving . The mayor here made me an offer I couldn 't refuse , my freedom . Remember what Nolan said . She 's a liar ! I was to be a spy for the Votanis Collective , a double agent . Is that true ? Did you make her a spy ? Hold on , now . Now the cat 's out of the bag . Why don 't you tell her the rest ? Our plan worked . Given my colorful wartime past , the V.C. were eager to work with me . But then something strange happened . Someone in the Votanis Collective , they never told me who , wanted leverage over you . This unnamed individual forced me to build Kenya . What I 'd like to know is why you failed to tell me this . None of this was mentioned in your reports . Well , if you had known that I was creating that monstrosity , you would have forced me to stop , right ? For Amanda 's sake . Of course . Oh , come on . You would have ruined an E-Rep sting just to protect my feelings ? I 've done worse . I 'm sorry if I caused you pain , but I had to save my own neck . I hope you 'll remember that later when you put a bullet in Nolan 's little girl . She 's coming with us . I 'll grab the roller . Thanks for that . I expect you 'll find a way to pay me back , Mr. Mayor . We got two more . In aaah ! Ah-uhh-uhhhh ... Ah ! Oh . Oh . It 's over . Are you gonna fall ? Think so . Whoa . If my parents find out about this , we 're dead . They won 't find out . You know my mom . Look , we 'll be back before they realize we left . We owe it to the baby to at least explore the option . And we need to protect her from your father . " Her " ? What makes you say " her " ? I have a feeling . Andina , I hope that we can trust you . It 's my sworn oath to keep family confidences . Even from other family members . - Look , there it is again . - There ! There . Yeah , I see it . What is that ? - Started about 20 minutes ago . - Another arkfall ? - What 's going on ? - We should get moving . What ... hang on . It might not be safe to travel . We shouldn 't go anywhere until we find out what 's going on . I think we 'll be safer on the road . Let 's go . Why are you pushing so much ? I 'm not pushing . Yeah , you are . You seem awfully anxious to get us in that car . I want nothing more than what is best for both of you . You 're family . Come on . Alak ! What is wrong with you ? Get in the roller ! Mommy 's here . Let go of me ! And if you struggle , you 'll hurt the baby . Come on , get in the car . Should I take the shot ? I can do this . Ah ! Aaaah ! Don 't kill him ! Freeze ! - Stupid bastard . - Aaah ! Ugh ! - Nolan , you have to stop . - Come here . Nolan . Why don 't you throw down the gun and we settle this like men ? No . Because you 're a bully . And bullies don 't care much for fair fights , do they ? We much prefer results . Doc . Sorry , I only brought one pair of cuffs . You 've been waiting for this moment , haven 't you ? I have . Oh ! Do you know what you 've done ? Dunno . Not finished yet . Nolan ! Ugh . You 're too late . This planet will feel the love of its devouring mother . Stay away from me . Stay back . _ - _ - Get away . - _ - Just stay back . Stay away . - _ - No . No ! No ! No ! _ - Uhh ... - Uhh ! Hey , Irisa . Hey . Hey . Come back to me . That 's it . Come back . There you are . Hey , kiddo . - Hey . - Tommy . That wasn 't you . No . No . No , that wasn 't you . - Give me your gun . - No . Stop it . Give me your gun or shoot me yourself . - Not gonna happen . - It 'll work now . - I can die . Please ! - Never gonna happen . Do you know how many people I have killed ? Do you know how many people you can still save ? Look at the sky . Kiddo , look up . That 's it . This thing 's not over . And the two of you may be the only people who can stop it . Hey , look at me . Look at me . Look at me . When this thing 's over , you still want that bullet , I will oblige you , I swear to you . But until then , you stop this whining and get on your feet . Come on . Come on . The lights are beautiful . Do you suppose they bring death ? Given the evil we 've done and the people we 've hurt , a blow struck from the heavens is better than we might have hoped for . Always the optimist . Favis ! Favis ! I 've been looking for you everywhere . Well , spit it out . Our best hope is Rafe McCawley . He knows that woman . Knows where she might run . He 'll be able to get inside her head . Getting inside her head will be easy , once I 've blown a large hole in it . Irina , come on ! _ Come on , move it . We don 't have all day . Let 's go . Line up . Line it up ! Ready ! And fire ! Hey ! What the hell is going on here ? Have you seen the purple lights ? Huh ? The prisoners panicked and started a riot . We don 't have any back-up . I 'm taking matters into my own hands . You make me sick , Sergeant . You are relieved of your command . Take those prisoners back inside . Go ! You filthy piece of ... Ugh ! I 've been here before . - You and I were here together . - We scuttled the ship . That 's right . We 're going to do it all over again . Sukar . Well , that 's a new look for him . I take it we 're looking for this arkbrain . It 's this way . We should be able to control it with our keys , force it to send the terraspheres back into orbit before they blow . What ? Company . No . No , no . No ! No ! No ! No ! So many ways to die in this new world . Hellbugs , wulokot fever . A firing squad feels ... Quaint ? Yeah , quaint . Ready ! And ... Good evening , Captain . We need this man . Family emergency . What 's going on ? Pilar has kidnapped Alak and Christie . Oh , God . Do you know where she might have taken them ? I don 't know . I 'll have to think about that . You should 've killed her all those years ago . Yeah , well , live and learn . Tommy ? How are you here ? Let me out . I have to get back to the mines . You 're still in the mines . A year ago , you let Kaziri inside you . To save Nolan . Yes . But you let me die . I didn 't deserve it . Nolan is the one you should let die . You know what kind of man he is . But you sacrificed everything to save him . Where is my sacrifice ? I deserve better from you . I know . I 'm sorry . Don 't say you 're sorry . Fix it . How ? Kaziri can bring me back . Just let her finish her mission . The ship is scared . She 'll bring me back . I can live . We can live . It knows we can stop it . I can be with you . Do you know none of this is real . Wake up . The Kaziri 's messing with your head . Ignore whatever it 's telling you . I can be with you . You can be my beautiful wife . All you have to do is say yes . She obeys her programming . She never falters on her promises . She 'll bring me back . Just like Sukar and Nolan . I just want my chance to live . Please . The Kaziri 's trying to stall you . I want to spend the rest of my life with you . Listen to me carefully . In you heart , you know this is not Tommy Lasalle . Tommy is dead . You have to let him go . I know that 's hard , but I raised you to do the right thing . You know what 's right . I believe in you . Please . I 'm sorry , Tommy . The answer is no . Why ? It was horrible . I saw my dead parents . They said I abandoned them in Tallahassee . What was that ? Proof that the ship is scared . She ought to be . Okay , kiddo , do your thing . Everything 's riding on this . The keys are overriding the system . We should be linked now . Can you hear me ? Yeah . It 's a little weird . Your voice is really loud . Can you access the terraspheres ? No . The arkbrain 's blocking me . I 'm shutting it down now . I 'm dying . And it 's your fault . I have to complete my mission . - It 's okay . - No , I have to . No , it 's okay . You can go . Okay , Kai . She 's gone for good . You 're clear . The spheres are about to detonate . Shoot them into orbit . Okay . Here goes nothing . He did it . He did it . We 're all going to live . That 's it ? Looks like we just saved the world . This whole place is gonna come down on our ears . Come on , you go . Come on , kiddo . On your feet . Come on . Here . That 's it , all right . All right , look at me . Hey . Look at me . That 's it . That 's it . You 're all right . You 're okay .

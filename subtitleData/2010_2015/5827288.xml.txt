 Previously on " The Lottery " ... Last time we spoke , you told me that you could help me get my son back . We 've got moles inside of the " D " of " H , " very close to your son . You give me a picture of my son wearing this mask , I 'll do whatever it is you want I 'm guessing the other day ... the extra perks ... comes with strings , right ? What do you want ? You don 't really want to be a mother , do you ? Excuse me ? We 're not saying that your father caused the fertility crisis , but we do believe he knew it was coming . What do you want from me ? Did he leave anything behind , maybe papers or a ... like a zip drive or anything ? Anything . It 's been eight years . There must be something . Dr. Kessler . Don 't make me shoot you for no reason . Wait . I need to get to Dr. Kessler 's . That 's the problem . Kessler just turned up dead . I don 't know what the hell you 've been doing . You have upset some very powerful people . I 'm gonna meet our friend later today . What if he doesn 't come through ? What if we don 't get the information we need ? What 's plan " b " ? Plan " b " ? There is no plan " b . " We 're trying to kill the damn king . Agent Kent said you could help me out . All I need is a photo and a start point . The person I want you to follow is Darius Hayes . For the record ... I 'm sorry it has to go down this way . I mean , Tom 's a good man . And I was hoping he 'd see the light . Were you sleeping ? Yeah . It all comes down to honesty . Truth ... the foundation of any good relationship , especially the relationship between a mother and a child . We can measure truthfulness over time using human observation , or we can measure it with technology . In the final challenge , each prospective mother will be connected to a polygraph machine and asked a series of probing questions . We 've heard what these women want us to hear . Now we hear the truth . Okay . Cut it . That 's a wrap . Vanessa , you ... you remember Rose . Nice job , everybody . Thanks . Yes , we met at the opening-night gala . It 's nice to see you again . - You , too . - What do you think ? Well , nothing says motherhood like an interrogation . Hello , everyone . Good morning . Rose . I saw you last night . You remember ? No , I don 't really ... I was really tired . Yeah . You mind if I borrow your father for a minute ? No . Great . You all right ? I don 't know . I ... D.C. is such a weird place . Like , I feel like everyone 's just always having these whispered conversations . You 're whispering . But , um ... Is there something on your mind ? If there 's ever anything you want to talk about , anything at all ... You can trust me . What are you ladies up to ? Just a little girl talk . That was exhausting . In a good way . Nice save . It 's just been a long time since I 've had that kind of connection . Yeah ? Yeah . Don 't get it . No , don 't get it . Hello ? This is Dr. Lennon . What ? I 'll be right there . What is it ? Alison , what 's wrong ? He 's been shot . - Who ? - James . S01E08 Truth Be Told Uh , can I help you , miss ? I 'm Dr. Lennon . I 'm here to see James Lynch . - Your relationship to Dr. Lynch ? - Co-worker . Friend . Is he okay ? Not sure . Doctor 's with him . Well , what happened ? Gunshot wound to the chest . Wh ... Where was he ? Who shot him ? We 're still investigating . Do you know a Dr. Mark Kessler Jr . ? Kessler Jr. no . Any idea what Dr. Lynch was doing at Dr. Kessler Jr . ' s beach house ? No , I-I have no idea . Where ... where 's James ? I need to talk to a doctor . I-I still have a few more questions . And I have no more answers . My friend may be dying . And if you keep me here , he may go before I can say goodbye . - We 're ready . - Okay . I 'll see what I can do . Our friend would like to meet with you later today . About what ? I thought it was all arranged . He didn 't say . Must be nice to have your daughter back . Have you talked to her about last night ? Excuse me ? Darius , she was right next to us . She was sleeping . No . She wasn 't . I saw her . She was on medication . I saw the pills . That 's what she does . She has a problem . I don 't need to tell you what the stakes are here . That 's right , Alan . You don 't . But if she did hear our conversation ... She didn 't . I 'm positive . Then I 'll leave it to you . There 's been no further contact with Darius ? This sniper ... what else can you tell me ? He 's traveling under an alias ... Eugene Jones . Pays cash for everything . He 's even got someone back home using his credit card so it looks like never left . He 's booked on a flight to Charlotte at 11 : 25 p.m. night after next . That 's the night of the lottery announcement . Is that what he 's ... ? It must be . It must be . Could he be targeting the president ? I don 't speculate . I give you information . What you do with it is up to you . Anything else ? I 'll be in touch . They know we 're onto them , Vanessa . They just shot James . It should have been me . I should have been the one playing detective at Kessler 's . Alison , this is not your fault . So , now what ? How do we nail the son of a bitch who did this ? I understand the urge to seek revenge . But right now , you need to lie low . Do nothing . It is too dangerous . Screw that ! This thing just got very personal . We need to nail Darius . No , we are not doing anything . I want to bury Darius just as badly as you do , but you have to let me handle this . Alison , they just went after James . They could come after you next . Please keep in mind , Miss Sommers this interview is being broadcast to the entire nation . Please answer with a simple " yes " or " no . " Do you understand ? Sounds pretty straightforward . " Yes " or " no . " Yes . You mentioned your mother was a drinker . Do you have a history of excessive use of alcohol ? I wouldn 't call it excessive . " Yes " or " no , " please . No . Have you ever consumed alcohol while working ? I was a bartender . Yes . Have you ever become violent while intoxicated ? Yes . Would you consider that appropriate behavior for a mother ? - No . - Do you believe it 's important to have an affectionate relationship with your child ? Yes . Was your mother affectionate with you ? That 's subjective and complicated . Do you feel you 're equipped to give a child everything that they might need to thrive in today 's world ? No . But who the hell is ? Think you 'll make a good mother ? I think I will try to do whatever is best for my child . If the answer is yes , please say yes . The answer is , I have no idea , and whoever claims to is full of shit . God bless you , James . Kyle . What 's the problem ? Didn 't have any luck cloning her phone . We tried , but it was encrypted . - You sure about that ? - Yep . We talked about security measures at the lab . She said the department of humanity is all over her phone and tablet . So , I guess you 're just gonna have to steal it . I 'm reborn in the eyes of the lord the sins of my past washed clean . I 've been born again in the eyes of the lord and the sins of my past washed clean . Hallelujah ! Get a move on , sister . It 's time for confession . - What , right now ? - Don 't worry . It 's the truth challenge . And you 're basically the poster child for the purity . Before I found Jesus , I was a different person . Different how ? Inside . You 're not a virgin , are you ? Spiritually , I am . So , that 's a no . Oh , God . Perry , I can 't do this . Everyone thinks I 'm perfect . Hey , I have the exact opposite problem . There 's nothing to worry about . They 're gonna find out . They probably won 't even ask if you 're a virgin or not . What if they do ask in front of the whole world watching ? - Slow down . - What am I supposed to do ? Here 's what you do ... you relax . - Oh , gosh . Relax ? - Yeah . Come on . Make your body relax . The machine only looks at how you react . It can 't look inside your heart . You think I can fool that machine ? I don 't think I can . If you stay calm , you will be fine . Yeah . You wanted to see me ? Yes , I did , George . I was wondering what kind of chatter you 've been hearing about the lottery finale . Just the usual ... some protests , some threats , nothing credible , thank God . Nothing at all ? Nothing almost credible ? No . Not that I know of . I spoke to the secret service two hours ago . - Business as usual . - What about the hotel security ? Let 's cut to the chase . What have you heard ? I 'm worried , George . I think the location is too visible . What have you heard ? I 'm just ... I 'm trying to protect the president . Given everything that 's going on right now , I think having this event at a hotel exposes him to unnecessary risk . You haven 't answered my question . Without any new , credible information , there 's no need to change venues , not from a security perspective , anyway . Right . Maybe we 'll have to find a political one . Thanks . Did you tour the location ? Twice . Position is serviceable . Distance won 't be a problem . Then why I am here ? There are three exits on the roof of the hotel ... north , south , and east . I need to know which one the target 's going to use . Why does that matter ? We secured you a vantage point for flexibility . Flexibility is for gymnasts . I need a clean shot . That means I need to know where he 's going to be , the exact door he 's going to exit . I 'll see what I can find out . Try to relax . It 's only a few questions . I 'm sorry . I just ... Can I have some water ? Of course . Shall we begin ? - Do you believe in God ? - Yes . Have you always believed in God ? Yes . Does it think I 'm lying ? Because I 'm not lying . I-I ... I mean , I 've had my doubts before in my life , but who hasn 't ? Try to relax . There 's no right answers . We 're just ... collecting information . Thank you . I understand you 're a virgin . Have you maintained your virginity strictly for religious reasons ? I believe it 's a small sacrifice to make for your husband . " Yes " or " no , " please . I-I 'm sorry . What ... what was the question ? Have you remained a virgin for religious reasons ? Oh ! I 'm so sorry ! I 'm so sorry ! I 'm so sorry ! Get me a towel in here . Damn it ! Go back to your room . We 'll pick this up when we get this fixed . Go . Damn it . I can 't go back in there , Perry . I 'm dropping out . What happened ? I spilled water on the machine thing . I had to get out of there . I 'm pulling out . Don 't be crazy . So what ? You 're not a virgin . Just own it . America will love you . It 's not America I 'm worried about . It 's my family , Raul . - Your fiancé doesn 't know ? - No . When you lie , you go all-in . I can 't go back in there , Perry . I 'd rather go home than let people know the truth . I quit . I 'm done . How 's James ? Fighting for his life . Doctor said he 'd call with an update . - Police know anything ? - No . Did you tell them anything ? No . Good . Where were you ? Took a walk . A walk ? I was with Rojas . That open and honest thing we talked about ... ? I know . So , why the hesitation ? I don 't know . James has been shot . Your life could be in danger . - It 's a lot to deal with . - I know . That 's why I need to know I can trust you . Of course you can trust me . If this is about your polygraph , you can relax . You were brilliant . Angela needs my help ... and quickly . Why are you so bent on helping your competition ? Angela 's not my competition . She 's my friend . And she can 't take the lie-detector test . So you pulled me out of my day for this ? If anybody deserves to be a mother , it 's Angela . So do a lot of other women who will never get the chance . But she would be amazing . I don 't have the patience that she does ... Or the support system . I thought you called me out here to discuss something important . I did . I 've been thinking about what kind of mother I would make . And I 'd be a good one . Okay . Maybe not great , but better than mine , and I turned out all right . But even if I 'm not the mother , I would still want to be a part of my child 's life . Of course . No , I would want that , too . I would want you to be like the baby 's big sister . I can do sister . A very rich sister . It 's not about the money . That doesn 't mean I won 't take it , but ... So , do we have a deal ? You need to help Angela . She shouldn 't have to humiliate herself in front of the nation to prove that she could be a good mother . Wow . You look great . Thank you . Trying for something worthy of the occasion . The announcement of the lottery winners ... it 's gonna be historic . Yeah , that 's ... That 's what I wanted to discuss . I 'm concerned about our approach . The whole idea of the making the announcement at a hotel ... I don 't think it 's the best choice . The parliament 's a wonderful venue . It 's just been renovated . It 's a little over-the-top . It 's not very inviting . Well , it 's the grand finale . Don 't you think it should be somewhere grand ? I just worry that it might feel a little cold . We 're choosing mothers . The venue should feel homey , warm . It shouldn 't feel like these women are being taken away . It should feel like they 're coming home . I ... I need to go , but ... I really think you should consider this . I 'll have to think about it . Please do . What is all this ? Kessler 's journal . James e-mailed me these photos right before he was shot . I 've been trying to make sense of it . Heliogenics was some kind of Manhattan project for infertility . Their mission was to reduce population growth in order to sustain the planet . Did Kessler know he was creating a weapon ? It doesn 't look like it . I mean , according to his journal , he was doing purely scientific research . And then things started to go haywire . Someone within the government decided to turn the infertility research into a weapon . This guy ... Mr. Torino ... was the guy Kessler was trying to find , trying to hide from . It 's not entirely clear , except for the fact Kessler hated Mr. Torino and thought he was the devil . Mr. Torino is a pseudonym ? For someone very powerful ... Someone who forced Kessler down a dark path ... someone who would eventually have him killed . I mean , this is Kessler 's case against Mr. Torino . Everything except his name . Which we know is Darius . Which doesn 't do us any good unless we can prove it . Well , Mr. Torino / Darius wiped his fingerprints off everything . Kessler and everybody at Heliogenics is dead . And as soon as we started to get close to Kessler 's son , he sent his thugs to beat up James . And as soon as James went to Kessler 's house ... It was Darius who warned James to stay away . It 's Darius who 's been covering up something all along . So then let 's keep digging . We need to find something solid . Open it . - What are they ? - Sedatives . To help calm her nerves . For a better chance at passing the test . It 's the best I could do . Yeah , I don 't think she 's gonna go for this . She 's not into drugs . If she wants to be a mother , she 'll take the pill . Simple as that . Thanks . Do we have an agreement ? Gettin ' closer . So , we have a list of e-mail addresses ... Which are all defunct . ... a few phone numbers ... Darius has wiped those clean , also . ... and a bunch of stuff that doesn 't make any sense , like this . Mr. Torino at 6880 DC . Could it be some kind of alphanumeric code ? " A-T , 6880 , D-C . " Mm . How old is Darius ? Maybe it 's a ... a birthday . August of ' 68 ? No , that 's not it . It 's a license plate . AT6880 / D.C. It 's a D.C. plate number . She 's got security scanning three new locations , including Westwood 's Virginia estate . Why ? Did she give a reason ? Something about optics . She wants the event to feel familial . I saw her this morning . She didn 't mention anything . That was before she met with the chief of staff . If they change venues , Darius , our plan goes to shit . I 'll look into it . I can 't help but feel this thing slipping away , Darius . Vanessa knows we 're about to make a move . - And your daughter ... - Rose ... didn 't hear a thing . I want to make sure we 're clear on that . Well , that leaves Vanessa . I 'll take care of her . I 've got what you 've been looking for ... 1973 Ford Torino . V8 engine , leather interior . Oh , she 's beautiful , isn 't she ? Do you remember who sold it to you ? Well , not exactly . That was eight years ago . Was it this man ? It was an auctioneer . I-I bought it at a charity auction . Anonymous donation . Imagine that ... someone giving away a car like this . Thank you very much for your time , Mr. Bradley . There has to be some kind of record , something still tying the car to Darius . We have the rantings of a dead man and an old Ford Torino . - It 's a start . - No , Alison . It 's an end . I 'm sorry , but I have to stop worrying about what Darius did . I need to focus on what he 's going to do next . I don 't know , Perry . It just feels like I 'm trying to hide one sin by committing another . It 's not ecstasy . It 's a sedative , like antianxiety . - Everybody takes them . - W-what if I get caught ? What if they do a random blood test ? They tested us right when we got here . This place is on lockdown . They 're not gonna test us again . - Where 'd you get them ? - A friend . A friend who won 't rat us out . It just feels like it 's cheating . Says the girl who took my slot in the psych exam . I 've lost my way . It 's time for me to go home . No . Wait . Angela , you 're a good person . I 'm just ... I 'm just trying to help , okay ? And you 're sorry , so God has to forgive you , right ? It 'll be okay . Hey . Isn 't there a Bible verse or something that says , " when God closes a door , he opens a window " ? That was " The sound of music . " Okay , so , almost the same thing . Thank you . Gabrielle . Sorry to keep bugging you , but where have you landed on the venue change ? I really think the parliament is the perfect location . Gabby , there are other reasons ... the lottery announcement is going to be an event that changes people 's lives . We need a grand venue for such an occasion . I 'm afraid I agree with Darius . It 's gonna be an unforgettable night . I 'm sure it will be . Just so you know , you 're not the only one freaking out about the lie-detector test . You should see some of the other women . When you get right down to it , everybody 's got some secret they 're trying to hide . Hey . You better wake up . Hey , come on . You have like 10 minutes before your test . Angela , wake up . Angela . Oh , God . Oh , God . Come on , Angela . Oh , God . Come on , Angela ! Snap out of it ! Angela . Help ! Somebody , help ! We need a doctor right now ! Hey ! Angela needs help ! Hurry . I don 't think she 's breathing . What happened ? I don 't know . She just stopped breathing . No pulse . Is she taking any medication , any drugs ? Yeah . Some sort of sedative . What kind ? I don 't know , but I don 't think they were strong . - How many did she take ? - I don 't know . On the ground ? Clear . There we go . Come on , Angela . Come on . Still not responsive . Angela , please . Let 's scoop and run . Ple ... please help her . - I was just trying to help her . - I know . She wanted so badly to be a mother . - Perry . - Why did we give her those pills ? Perry , I need you to calm down . - We killed her . - Hey , now , you listen to me . We did not kill Angela , all right ? I told her to take one , just one , but she was so worried about passing the test ... All right . All right . You need to stay out of it . All right ? If anybody asks , your answer is , " I do not know . " All right ? - What is the coroner gonna say ? - He 's doing an autopsy now . And then I 'm sure he 'll eventually get around to the truth , which is that Angela was having a hard time coping with the stress of the competition . And she somehow got hold of some sedatives , and she took too many . All right ? - Okay ? - We gave her those pills . Now , that is exactly what you are not going to say ever ... to anybody . Do you understand me ? - I should have just let her go home . - But you didn 't . You 're a smart girl , Perry . You need to think this through . Now , you can either have a bright future with a lot of money or you can dig your own grave . Now , that shouldn 't be a difficult decision to make . Look , our relationship is based on trust . I can 't just go in there and take Alison 's phone . Oh , because you 're sleeping with her . Because she 'll know it 's me . Then I lose all access to her . That doesn 't do you any good now , either , does it ? Fine . Fine . You don 't want to take her phone , I understand . We 're still gonna need the information her phone was going to give us . What the hell do you want with Alison ? She 's just as anti-government as you are . Just be straight with me . What the hell are you guys after ? We want the embryos . At the end , that 's all that really matters . Everything else will fall away . Whoever controls the embryos controls the future . We need Dr. Lennon to make this happen . Come on , Kyle . Why do you think we went after you ? We knew you had an in with Alison . So , you helping me get Elvis back ... that 's what ? A means to an end . This looks nice . It is nice . It 's one of my favorite spots . - Thank you . - I 'm so thirsty . You know , I was , um ... thinking just the other day , the vice president has a daughter your age . Did you know her at school ? No . But you 've met the vice president , right ? No , I don 't think so . He was at the house last night . I meant to introduce you . Yeah , I was so tired . I don 't really remember anybody . Plus , I feel like all those politicians just all look the same to me . I know what you mean . You know , when I 'm with politicians , sometimes we speculate about things ... Different political scenarios . But it 's not real . It 's just an exercise . We play games . Yeah , that makes sense . I 'm sure it 's just ... all white noise to you when you hear us talking . Yeah , pretty much . You know , Rose , I 've been thinking about the last six years since the , uh , fertility crisis began , and I ... I want to apologize if I have not been available or if I 've been preoccupied . I want us to spend more time together . Yeah , that would be ... awesome . And I really , really want you to speak freely with me . Tell me whatever it is you 're feeling . It 's really important that we tell each other the truth . Yeah , of course . I 'm just gonna run to the bathroom . Okay . Excuse me . Hi . It 's Rose . Um ... It 's about my father . I think that he 's up to something . He 's involved in something ... big , and I just wanted to talk to somebody . - Sorry . - Who were you talking to ? You called somebody . I saw you . I was just talking to my friend . No big deal . May I see your phone ? - What ? - I 'd like to see your phone . - What are you talking about ? - I want to know who you called . Rose ... I need to know that I can trust you . - Who are you right now ? - Your father . Pardon me . - Here . - Don 't . I 'm so sorry , sir . Look , I don 't mean to drop this all on you . I just want to be up front about all this . So , Rojas claims he can get all this back . But to do that , he wants you to clone my phone , eavesdrop , and steal information . Pretty much . Do you really think he can do it ? Or is this some kind of game he 's playing ? I 'm not sure , but he has access to the department of humanity . I saw Elvis on video . And he has moles on the inside . That I know . Set up a meeting with Rojas . You don 't have to do this . Set up the meeting . Hi . This is Rose . Leave me a message . Rose , hi . It 's Vanessa . Um , I 've been trying to get a hold of you . I 'm here . I 'm at the garage . But I don 't see you . Call me back . Rose ? Rose ? Hello ? Rose ? Hello ? Darius . Hello , Vanessa . - I j ... I was just ... - I know . I know why you 're here . Rose left her phone at the restaurant . You were the last person she called . What do you want ? I just want the truth . About what ? Rose . You . Darius , I don 't know what you 're talking ... Would you like a drink ? No . This could take some time . I 'm not doing this . Yes , you are .

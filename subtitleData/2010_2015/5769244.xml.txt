 [ Voices speaking foreign languages ] Greetings from the west . And from the east . We 'd like to commission another painting from you . Of course . Something for your permanent collection ? Yes , to be completed by Friday . Can you handle that timeline ? I 'll gather my materials and start to work immediately . [ Rock music ] Right here ! Ball ! Whoo . ♪ Nice . [ Speaking indistinctly ] ♪ Right here ! Ball ! ♪ Oh , right here , man . [ Groans ] Ugh . Ah . Yeah . Keep your eyes forward , rook . Always know what 's coming . [ Blows whistle ] [ Exhales ] - Take five . - I know . Why don 't you check with him , all right ? Yeah , I will . Dude , nice push out there , man . The boys play rough sometimes . Hustle . Well , I can take rough . I didn 't come out here to be a spectator . Three days of practice , I haven 't gotten one touch on the ball . [ Indistinct chatter ] Last year those boys played in over 55 matches , which is a long campaign , a war . Hey , you don 't go into battle with just anyone . I can do this . They just need to give me a chance . Then think beyond the pitch . A team is an organism . It has its own immune system , and it 's first reaction to an invader is to repel . Well , how do I change that ? You become one with the system . Bravo . Mr. Galan would like to see you in his office upstairs . What about ? He wants your help picking out drapes . What the hell do I know ? [ Cell phone rings ] Hey . How 's it going out there ? Being the new kid in school ? It takes some getting used to . Well , if it helps , we 've been able to tap Galan 's network using the sat codes you lifted at the party . We 've also been able to pinpoint locations of active phones within a 100-meter radius . What about chatter ? Anything we can work with ? Some possible developments overseas , but I 'll keep you apprised . Well , I got a possible development here . I 've just been summoned to Galan 's office . Do you think you 've been compromised ? I don 't know . I 'll keep you apprised . [ Indistinct chatter ] See , what did I tell you ? Come in . Ah , Mr. Bravo . Coach said you wanted to see me , sir ? I wanted to make sure that you didn 't have any issues with your contract . I assumed you 'd be a little more eager to make things official . Oh . Well , yeah . No , I am eager . It 's just my stepdad ... he wanted to take a look at the contract before I sign anything . - Oh , he 's an attorney ? - No , not exactly . I mean , he doesn 't have a degree or anything . He 's ... a notario . He 's a notario . Degrees are overrated . I dropped out of secondario to sell cigars to American tourists . I got my degree on the streets . [ Chuckles ] The world has enough lawyers , huh ? Oh , no , no offense , Lou . But do impress upon your stepfather , Mr. Bravo , we would like to get things squared away by the end of the week . Yes , sir . No , I will . I will . Thank you . [ Door opens ] What do you got for me ? Oh . What ? - Nothing . - Okay , so ... I just have this vision of us being the kind of team where when one person stops for coffee , there 's a text exchange of some sort . Hmm . Do you want mine ? You already drank from it ? No thanks . Recently recorded audio from Galan 's party line . - [ Recording plays ] - I 'd like to commission another painting from you . Of course . Something for your permanent collection ? Yes , to be completed by Friday . Can you handle that timeline ? I 'll gather my materials and start to work immediately . - [ Clicks switch ] - Call was flagged yesterday . L.A. to Kerava , Finland . Best guess from the windtalk , Galan 's people are ordering up a hit . Did you notify our people out there , let them know something 's going down on their turf ? It 's not going down on their turf . Right after that call yesterday , the Kerava phone went off line . 17 minutes ago , the signal was up again in L.A. LAX . They 're flying in the cleaner . So the target is here . We know they 've been planning something stateside . This could be it . [ Rock music ] ♪ Can I get that bag for you , sir ? Thank you . No . But I 'd kill for a cinnabon . How was your flight ? I fly like the dead . That 's your target . Photos , agenda , medical history . You didn 't want to handle this yourself ? It has to look natural . I don 't do natural . Then you 're not challenging yourself . In any case , I 'm pleased to be back in the City of Angels . I haven 't killed anyone here since 1998 . [ Groans ] Yeah , get used to that pain , baby . Last of the new guys . The pain 's gonna come down on you . Yeah , I noticed . Those other two guys weren 't out there today . What happened to them ? Word is had a little stoppage time with Galan 's daughter at his party . You want a future here , stay far away from that mess . Tony Bravo . Reyna Flores . Yeah . Yeah , I 'm a fan . Feeling 's mutual . You got a few minutes ? For ? - An interview . - Oh , right . [ Cell phone rings ] One second . Yeah , it 's Tony . Yeah , I 'll be right out . Sorry , I got to go . Some other time maybe ? I 'll hold you to that . Slow news week ? Seriously , Flores , the guy fixes cars - for a living . - So ? Kurt Warner was bagging groceries . A year later , he won the Super Bowl . Is that an American Football reference ? 'Cause that comparison on its face is an insult to my profession . It really isn 't any of your business , now is it , Holester ? Look , the guy can barely play . I just wouldn 't want to see you waste your time . That 's all . You 're intimidated by him . Hmm . Do I ... Do I look intimidated ? Yeah , take your time , Bravo . Jesus . - Please don 't slam my doors . - What 's up ? That development overseas Annie was telling you about just took a plane and landed in our backyard . That was taken at LAX 45 minutes ago . Orval Harju , aka " The Apothecary . " Got a Ph.D. in biochemistry at 17 . These days he spends his time as an international assassin majoring in toxins . Toxins . Like poison ? Poisons , nerve gas , radio isotopes . You ever hear a theory that Hugo Chavez was given cancer ? You 're telling me Galan 's people did that ? I 'm telling you it 's a theory . The point is this guy 's involved with whatever they 're planning . I got a fix on his phone . We got to get up on him , figure out who he 's here to kill . [ Engine turns ] [ Speaking spanish ] Um , honey , no , no . A little bit higher , and a little bit more to the left . Mom , it 's fine . My arms are killing me . Your brother just spent a year and a half in jail . You can spend five minutes holding up a banner . [ Sighs ] Karen , did you call Tony ? He said he 'd be here at 6 : 00 . Hmm . Javi , what are you doing ? You 're supposed to be seeding the peppers . I 'm going over Tony 's contract . Listen to this language . Here . " The Riot will own Tony 's likeness " throughout the universe " in perpetuity , in all media " now known or hereafter devised forever and ever ... " [ Mumbles ] Are they paying him to play soccer or travel through time ? Does this mean he 's going to be doing , like , commercials and stuff ? No , baby , I think they 're just trying to cover their bases . Yeah , I don 't think there 's much chance of Tony becoming the next David Beckham . You know , as far as I 'm concerned , they can have whatever they want because they got him out of the D.E.A. , and now that Tony might be having some stability in his life , maybe he 'll start thinking about marriage or maybe starting his own family . I wouldn 't describe the life of a professional athlete as stable . Just saying . Yeah , I know what you 're saying . You 've been saying it for years . There 's always Ricky . What ? Oh , my God . Okay , guys , I have to go home and change . I will see you at 6 : 00 . Okay ? Love you guys . [ Chuckles ] Babe . Help us . Are you sure this is the right place ? - Give or take 100 meters . - So not really . This is where social engineering comes in , my unlearned friend . Harju is a native of Finland . Fins drink more coffee per capita than any other country . So what , he likes a nice latte before a kill ? They don 't drink lattes . You know how they drink it ? Put an egg in it . [ Clicking tongue ] Raw . Remember , if you spot Harju , don 't engage . We 're just monitoring . [ Indistinct chatter ] - [ Laughs ] - That 's cute . Keep dreaming , Matador . That was with soy , right ? Yeah , yeah . Please . So what 's the story with your brother ? You 're the guy with all the intel . I know he punched a cop . Off duty , you know , and Ricky didn 't know he was a cop . You know what ? I 'm not talking about my family with you . Fine . We got to talk about something , though . Otherwise , we look suspicious . We should talk about how you almost shot me in the leg . That ? [ Scoffs ] Operational determination . I was only gonna graze it . There . There , there . See ? What did I tell you . - One thing , though . - What 's that ? Where 's his coffee ? [ Coughing ] [ Gags ] Somebody help ! Donna ? Stay on Harju . I 've got her . [ Choking ] - [ Crying ] - Give her some air . Give her some air . Call an ambulance . [ Crying ] - [ Phone beeps ] - _ - [ Hospital chatter ] - _ [ Exhales ] She didn 't make it . Respiratory failure . Doctors are calling it a possible food allergy . Whatever Harju used was undetectable , and the reaction Tony described was some kind of neurotoxin . Any idea why Galan wanted to kill this woman ? Donna Rossi . No significant political affiliations , no criminal record , no international travel in the past ten years . Recently took a job with child and family services . In short , there is nothing here that suggests on the surface that there 's any sort of overlap with criminal concerns . Yeah , I 'm gonna get back to the office and see if I can dig a little deeper . Excuse me . I ... I wanted to thank you for what you did earlier . I didn 't know what to do . I just froze . I wish I could have done more . Well , you gave her a chance . Thank you . [ Sniffles ] - That 's her friend . - Go after her . I think she 's a little wrecked right now . Cheer her up , and while you 're at it , find out everything you can about Donna Rossi . My brother 's welcome-home party is in two hours . Well , work fast . Hey . Are you gonna be okay ? I don 't know . Well , that 's normal . Do you have a lot of experience with this sort of thing ? Not this exactly , but , I mean , I 've seen some friends die . Oh , were you in the military or ... No , just neighborhood stuff . I think you and I come from different neighborhoods . So , what am I supposed to do now ? Have a drink , get with friends , cry it out . I don 't have any friends . I mean , not here . I 'm visiting . Visiting ? Donna , in part . [ Exhales ] [ Laughs ] The drink idea sounds like a good one . I came here in the ambulance . Do you know where I might get a cab to the Turlington , downtown ? Two things you won 't find in L.A ... an NFL football team and cabs . [ Laughs ] Well , thank you . I 'll ... I 'll figure it out . You know ... I should just give you a ride . Oh , you 've done so much . No , it 's not a problem . It 's on my way home , actually . Thank you . [ Gasps ] They are here . They 're here . - [ Door opens ] - Hey , welcome home . [ Cheers and applause ] What 's going on ? Where 's Ricky ?

[ Laughs ] You know , if you moved that good when the cops came , maybe you wouldn 't have been arrested . Who 's this tall chick ? Where 's my sister ? [ Laughter ] I hope you 're hungry ' cause we made you a feast fit for a king . I 'm good . We went to Cinco Puntos on the way here . But we have all this food . Just be glad we didn 't go to his first choice . - In-N-Out . - That 's one way of putting it . Please tell me you did not ask your father to take you to a prostitute . What ? 18 months in a cell . What can I say ? Ew . Welcome home , Ricky . Oh . Senorita Morales , you 're looking good . You still doing that Booty Camp ? - Boot Camp . - Whatever it 's called ... That shit 's paying dividends . - Hey , no cursing . - Oh , hey . Oh , oh . [ Laughter ] So where 's Tony ? Hey , where 's Tony ? Nice place . You never been ? - Mm-mm . - Mm . Not really my crowd . Right , different neighborhoods . Thank you , for keeping me company . I just still can 't believe today actually happened . [ Cell phone vibrates ] You two were close ? Mm . We used to be . In college , we were inseparable . Shared everything . Apartment , car , clothes , a boyfriend . [ Giggles ] That did not end well . Anyway , after college , I took a job in Berlin , and we lost touch . It 's just so unfair . She was so excited . She just got a new job and a new place . What kind of work did she do ? Psychologist . She worked with children , of course . Right ? Something really important . I work in the art world . What , that 's not important ? Mm . More like self-important . It 's scary , isn 't it ? One day we 're here , and the next ... [ Snaps fingers ] Gone . Like , our entire lives are balanced on the point of a needle , and any little thing can just topple us over . Well , you don 't seem so easy to topple . [ Laughs ] Everyone topples eventually . [ Sighs ] Make good memories . That 's what my dad used to say . That 's the best we can do . And have you ? What if tonight was it ? What if it was your last night on Earth ? I 'm not sure I 'm someone who 'd want to know . But say you did . Would you feel like you 've lived ? Like , really lived , no regrets ? I guess not . Don 't guess . Yeah . Me neither . I don 't want to live like that anymore . Who says you have to ? [ Cell phone rings ] The great Alec Holester . To what do I owe the pleasure ? Oh , so now you want to help me with my Tony Bravo story . I 'm listening . What hotel ? Mm . Hi . Hey . I 'm late for a thing . A thing . I pegged you as more creative than that . No , my brother ... he 's coming home . We 're having a party . Oh , was he traveling ? No , he was locked up . Oh . This was nice . You want to come back in the morning ? I 'll let you buy me coffee . - Well , I have practice . - Practice ? Yeah , I play for the L.A. Riot . Soccer ? Oh . You get more interesting by the moment . Well , you 'll make a great memory . You too . Yeah , I know . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I got hung up . Right . Yeah , I 'm gonna get the ice . Yes , mother . I know . I know , I know , I know .

 IJON TICHY - SPACE PILOT The Star Diaries Freely produced by themes from the novel " Star diaries " by Stanislaw Lem I was flying my rocket on Wednesday , September 27th ... on my way to the Egg Planet . Come here ! Take over the wheel ! You lazy Holograph ! I hadn 't eaten in days , so I wanted to be ready ... to sit down to fresh-omelet eggs . Hey ! If you 're not working , then at least do the dishes ! No ... I am an individual . I have my own life . And my own needs . Washing dishes is not part of that ! Watch this then ! Ouch ! What are you doing ? Keep you hands off my technology ! Why ? You said yourself you 're an individual . " INDIVIDUAL " Your job is to do the dishes ! I 'm not a piece of furniture that you can simply use ! Don 't chew ! Swallow ! I want my plates sparkly clean ! Suddenly the rocket made a sharp turn - heading for the Furniture Store Planet . Who 's in there ? I suspected a sly stowaway ... steering the rocket . Who 's at the wheel ? Oh , I don 't believe this . What 's going on here ? What 's this ? What 're you doing under my sofa bed ? Mr. Tichy , it 's Mel , Professor Tarantoga 's assistent . What 're you doing here ? - I want to go home . Here . And ? Same footprint . So what ? Did you let him into the rocket ? - Yes , Tarantoga was cruel to him . Back you go to the Tarantoga guy . Tarantoga ? Look here ! I 'm busy ! Oh , it 's you Mr. Tacky , what do you want ? Your furry pest-friend is here , playing hide and seek ! Ah , so Mel 's with you ! Tell him to get back here immediately . Hey , what 's going on here ? - Please don 't send me back ! Tarantoga treats him like a slave . I have a problem with that . Don 't you start with that " individual " stuff again ! That 's just it . I don 't know what I am . What kind of individual . Maybe you know ? - Yeah , yeah ... Furry mop ? Sausage dog ? Nope ... Don 't know . Ok , are we done here ? No one can tell me what planet I come from ... or what race I belong to . So what ? - This ... is the first lead I have . Silly crap ! Is that why we 're flying to the Furniture Planet ? Unbelievable ... What 's that ? A receipt . For my appliance . The broken part , the handle . The guarantee for the busted Hallucinette-appliance ... was due to expire , today . So I thought we 'd swing by the Furniture Planet ... only because of the guarantee . Mel , I can see you ! I know you 're there ! We don 't have time now ! Bye-bye ! If the Mel-fellow ... - Mel . really wants to go to the Furniture Planet ... we could make a teensy-weensy stop ? This sofa would fit perfectly between the closet and the control desk . For you ! I don 't need it . I 'll stay on my planet . The Furniture Planet was in a strange neighborhood . I looked it up in the Cosmic Encyclopedia , it said : Contact to this planet was broken off . Whoever visited it , never came back . I decided to land anyway . Mr. Tichy , no ! You 've no right to turn me off . It 's patronizing and inhumane . Hold on to this ! I demand you keep me turned on ! Alright . But then , give yourself a piggyback ride . It 's degrading , carrying myself on my back . You wanted independence . You got it ! GLÜE , % öff Very interesting . And it 's all on sale ! These plant-remains were on my feet ... when I came to Tarantoga . I 've no memory of it . But it 's the only clue to my heritage . Hello ! This planet is spooky . It 's all so dead-duck here . Maybe it gets better over there ! Hey , you fuzzy klutz . - Who ? Me ? Don 't drop my guarantee receipt ! Got it ! My flowerpot ! Mel ! - My guarantee receipt ... Don 't move ! Gotcha , glue strangler . Get back in the rocket ! - But Mel ? Hurry ! I 'll get him . I 'll get him . Ouch ! Holy Crap ! My guarantee receipt is gone ! Receipt ? Poor Mel is gone . Obviously , this is not his planet . Do you have a screw loose ? This is the Planet-of-the-Living-Furniture ... Yes . They attacked us when we crossed the yellow line . Maybe we just can 't step over the yellow line ? That 's it . We can 't take the shortcut , but have to go through the displays . Let 's try again . But first ... It 's nice and quiet . Come on ! Here 's where the sofa took off . With my receipt ! With Mel ! My receipt ! Kamikaze ! Sucka our soul , wöödenheärta ... Sinner ... Follöw ... Where isä ? Enda fürnita öppresson foreva , furnitä fightbacka , nowa ! Furnita avenga universa completä ! Little testa , then starta ! It seemed the live furniture was planning to invade the universe ! Dün with the ön-üs-sitters ! Dün with the dräwer-stüffers ! Dün with the üs-üsers ! Down with the dish-dirtiers ! Dün with the dish-dürtiers ! Oh , hello ! Lagan Rentig . Me ? I 'm Analogue Hallucinette . Ånalögahålözinätta ! ? Can you tell me , can I get the folding sofa MEL in this design ? Gööse bumps ! Really ? Good . Then I 'd like the Gööse bümps model . Bütiful girl . Föllow me tü Testlaböratöry ! Get your grabby fingers off me ! You ugly dim-lamp . I 'll short-circuit you ! This furniture had gone through a transformation . And I was sitting in a big fat trap . But then I saw something encouraging . The handle of my crappy machine is broken . I still have the guarantee receipt , look ! Oh , it 's too late for that . Hey ! It 's still valid . I 'm losing my patience with your crappy service ! One more . Now 's not the time for a lunch break , ok ! What 's going on here ? All the furniture has been infected . We wanted to save on personnel ... so we bred furniture that would pack and manufacture itself . Unfortunately , the furniture began to fight against its oppressors . They are in charge now . The furniture is now preparing for a huge delivery . A " cosmic invasion " . They want to take revenge on the universe . I 'll knock your lights out ... Now I saw that the furniture could wrap ... and stack itself . It was like a huge army . Here I was in this weird lab ... where they tested furniture against its opponents . So what ? Big deal ! Klätt Assembla ! - Yes , yes , assembla . This goes here , and the bar goes through the pillow ... Assembla ! This last part . I don 't want to ... Now I understood this test : The furniture parts only got really mad ... when they were put together right . Pösitiva , pösitiva . Yes , it 's quite nice ! Do you have it in a lighter shade ? To brighten up the room , you know ? Shutupa ! Dishwäsher annoyinga ! Dishwasher ? Shutupa ! You Natt ! So , that 's how it is . I get it ! Klätt Assembla ! Spöka , du Natt ! If I assemble it , then it 'll attack . Assembla ! Okay , okay , I 'll have a look . Seems complicated ? Klätt assembla ! Gö-gö ! Make it better , you Natt ! I don 't think I can solve this puzzle . I swear ! Assembläplanö , gö-gö ! Assembläplanö ? Here , assembläplanö för Idiota ! These instructions were so simple ... I couldn 't play stupid any longer . I had to put the chair together . And , how feela ? Not good ! How it feela tö be useda ? Not so good . You will never abuse Hällüzinätta - applianca again , do you hear ? You will do the dishes by hand ! I promise ... I won 't use the holographic appliance again ! That 's good to know . Mr. Tichy ! Dishwäsha killa sofabossa , now Killa escapa ... I don 't think we can stop the invasion ! Too many stored packages . This furniture is not dangerous as separate parts in boxes . But correctly assembled , it attacks . Mr. Tichy , you really couldn 't put it together , could you ? You only managed to do it after you got the instructions . Very funny . I couldn 't pretend to be dumb anymore . The instructions were too clear . So we falsified the instructions , made them so complicated ... that no normal person could follow them . Let 's get out ! It 's gonna take off . Poor Mel . Are you coming ? And so I was back on track to the Egg Planet ... 'Cause saving the universe from a furniture invasion makes you hungry . Well , later people said I made the whole thing up ... These tabs are really delicious ! Do they have them in other flavors ? These dishes are just as dirty as before ! Nasty people said that I secretly drank too much alcohol on earth ... but lost all inhibitions ... The invasion has begun ! - on long space voyages . It 's the sofa for Mel . But we don 't need it anymore ! God knows how this rumor got started . Damnit Tricky ! What 's up with Mel ? I don 't recommend it . A cheap copy ! People are like that . They 'd rather believe a bunch of silly crap ... Isn 't it wonderful ? than perfectly good facts !

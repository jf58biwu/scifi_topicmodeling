 Previously on caprica ... All my friends have failed me , so I 'm taking a chance on a bid for freedom . Stop . Philo , it 's me . Having let down my best friend , I find myself getting deeper into the STO . Are you fully committed to the cause ? Give me that knife . My struggle with Barnabas for control of the Soldiers of the One on Caprica is coming to a head . While I 've been trying to get everyone to lie low , you 've trying to build a power base . Gonna run off to STO central on Gemenon and tell on me ? Mother , I need authority to assert total control over all STO cells on Caprica . Agreed . My life is in shambles . I 'm resorting to desperate means to get it all back . Guatrau ... Tomas Vergis has taken my company away from me . I want it back . I 'm gambling that I can convince your Guatrau that my company will be more valuable to him operating business as usual with my hand at the tiller . That 's one hell of a gamble . I feel like I don 't even know my own husband anymore . Vergis told me that you stole his chip and killed two of his employees . Is it true ? I 've discovered that Clarice Willow is the only one I can really trust . Can we talk ? Will you call me ? Please ? I love you . Well , it 's good to be home . Last boarding call for rendez-vous colonial flight 308 to Gemenon . It 's not like he said . There 's too many people . We 've got to call it off . You gonna tell Barnabas that ? He will kill you . It 's true , Lace . You know it . Let 's get it done . Flight 572 to Tauron has been relocated to gate 27 . Miss , you all right ? My temple group , we missed our flight to Picon , and I just ... I 'm gonna have to see in that bag . Come on ! Let 's go ! Just shut up and drive ! Why are there people following us ? You were supposed wait for us out front ! What are you thinking ? Would someone please tell me what 's going on ? Lacy , what happened ? Why do you still have your bag ? Keep your head down and plant the frakkin ' bomb ! I 've already got mine rigged , OK ? - We can just set it off . - What 's going on with you ? - I 'm gonna blow them . - Then blow it ! - Lacy , why do you still have your bag ? - Wait ! What ? I still have it . - What ? What are you ? - Give me the bag . She 's got the bomb with her . Holy frak , Lace . Do you have any idea how close you came to blowing us up ? Get rid of it . Get rid of it ! I 'm not going to jail for you . They 've probably found our bombs by now . Do you have any idea how much evidence we 've left behind ? Instead of tiny bomb fragments , now there 's whole bombs covered in our fingerprints . I feel sick . It 's gonna be okay . - I 'll talk to Barnabas . - It 's not gonna be okay . Not this time . You 're not gonna talk to him . You 're not gonna smooth anything over . All our evidence is left in there . The operation is blown . You almost got shot ! We almost all died ! It is frakked up ! Have you ever not frakked something up in your life ? Why did we bring her ? Stop . Stop the car ! Frak you ! Hello , Cornell . I 'm so sorry to drag you all the way out here . - What is going on ? - May I offer you something-coffee ? No , I don 't want coffee . I want to know what you 're doing sending this guy to my home , in front of Helen and the kids . Sorry . You should return a message now and then . It 's good business . You were voted out . I can 't have direct contact with you . You know that . How would it look ? It would look loyal . Please , sit down . I know how difficult it was for you to overcome your addiction . - I 've been clean for three years . - I know , that 's admirable . You have rebuilt your life , and as your friend , I can respect that . But you need to protect that life . You need to protect Helen and the kids . There 's going to be a vote coming up , - and ... - And you want my vote . Yes , I do . I don 't deserve this , Daniel . Tell that to the young girls that I had to pay off for you . The ones you liked to hurt . I know you didn 't mean to , Cornell . Please ... Don 't do this . Do I have your vote ? You 're a disgrace . That 's irrelevant . I don 't suppose Helen knows about any of this , does she ? I wonder how she 'd react to it , and your kids . I can 't imagine . Listen to me . I made a mistake . All you have to do is the right thing , and all this will go away . It will go away . I am not gonna let myself be blackmailed . All you have to do is the right thing , and this will all go away . Cornell , please . You 're an ambitious man . I won 't . - I won 't . - All right . All right . Friend , Daniel ? I 'm just talking about keeping her safe . She 's exhausted . She 's had a horrific accident . I know you care about your patients , but I would appreciate if ten people weren 't coming in and out all the time . She needs her rest ! Amanda ? Did you call ? Come here . What are you doing here ? I saw all the coverage on TV about your fall . Daniel called the nurses ' station , and he 's on his way . He 's just stuck in some traffic , but he 'll be here shortly . Tell him I don 't want to see him . Big storm . I miss this from Tauron . That 's Lillian Teller . She 's been on the board about 11 years-old money . She was an easy one . Yes . Boys ... That 's always been her weakness . You go to a whorehouse , expect to be on camera . Lucky for us , she had no idea . - This is the only way . - I get it . Let 's move on . Vital Corso . Drunk-driving . If he doesn 't care about the old convictions coming out , we can set up a fake police stop . Very innovative . Gods . Terry Albick . You want to stop ? Excuse me if I 'm having a hard time finding the joy in this enterprise , but I know these people . They 're a part of my life . I 've been to their weddings , their kids ' birthday parties . - We vacation together . - And yet every one of them sold you out the second Vergis came calling . So Terry Albick ... So far , he 's clean , but , we 're still early in the process . We 're pulling , credit reports , bank statements . I 've ordered a background check . Have you heard back from them yet ? I got nothing . He 's sleeping with his sister-in-law . Has been for about six years . He hates that he 's cheating , but he really loves her . I think his nephew might actually be his son . Terry 's quite proud of him . You 'd be surprised what comes out at corporate retreats . I think we can count on his vote . Yes . Who 's next ? Just try and eat a little something . How can I eat this when it tastes like vomit ? Do you have to make everything so unpleasant ... all the time ? You know , maybe it 's because I hate you . But don 't worry . I 'll be dead soon , and then we 'll both be happy . They 're my kids . They wouldn 't betray me . They wouldn 't . Barnabas has turned them all , Clarice ... Pann , Hippolyta . - Who 's told you this ? - GDD , highly placed . The four of them were caught on camera three hours ago , attempting to bomb the spaceport . They tried to kill you , Clarice , and they will try again . What are you going to do about it ? I don 't deserve this , Daniel . Please . You have rebuilt your life , and as your friend I can respect that . But you need to protect that life . You need to protect Helen and the kids . Seven-day outlook , storms will continue to pound Caprica City for the next ... This is not just a teeny , flimsy chain . - No , this is a really ... - Look at the quality of this rope . A high-ranking Graystone board member was found dead early this morning , the victim of a self-inflicted ... Sanjay has won 1,153,000 cubits ! We 're still on the scene at this hour . GDD sources are telling us that so far , no one has stepped forward to claim responsibility for that botched bombing that happened here just ... I 'm sorry . Pann . You were the first , you know , to join . And now you repay that by joining Barnabas against me . I think it 's all my fault . - No , it 's not . - I don 't know if I can forgive you . Please , let me explain to you . I was confused . I heard things , and I didn 't know what to think . Barnabas said that there would be a better way , and I listened to him . I listened to him , and I turned my back on you , and I know I let you down . But I 've learned from that . I betrayed you , Clarice . But give me another chance . Don 't do this . Please don 't do this . Give me a chance , just one chance , and I 'll show you I can be righteous . Please forgive me . Please forgive me . Please . I do . I do forgive you . Thank you . But I 'm the easy one . It 's God you should be worried about . Hello , Hippolyta . Do you want to come in ? Look , I 'm really sorry . We didn 't mean anything by it . I 'm really ... Barnabas , it 's me . I want to come in . I wanted Pann and Hippolyta here , but I can 't reach them . So explain it to me . How did last night go so wrong ? You led us to believe that it would be empty . It wasn 't . It got complicated , and I was spotted . - I couldn 't plant the last device . - You couldn 't or wouldn 't ? I recall a certain reluctance when we tried to kill Clarice . Because that was reckless . I don 't know what the personal thing is between you . - I don 't have to explain anything . - But it 's making us take crazy risks . - When I say " do something " , - I get it when we hit that 's places , 'cause we 're making people look at the way they 're living their lives . - If it doesn 't get done ... - I told you I couldn 't ! That 's the last place in the world you want to be . It 's not like Pann and Hippolyta to miss a meeting . Do you know anything about that ? They are loyal to me . Are you loyal to Clarice ? Are you her mole ? Of course not . Barnabas ... Oh , my ... You ... are working against me ! I have done everything you 've asked ! Don 't call me disloyal ! Just promise me ... Promise me that you 're loyal . I am committed to God . I need to talk to you . I need to talk to you . Please ! Cornell , he killed himself ! I know you know something ! My husband is dead ! What am I supposed to tell my children ? What am I supposed to do ? What kind of man are you ? Drive . You 're a murderer ! Keep driving . Thank you for ... finally letting me come and see you . Did you really have those men killed in order to steal the MCP ? That 's not fair . How was I to know ... what was gonna happen ? If I 'd known ... You hired criminals . What did you expect ? Who knows where our actions will lead . It 's in the stars . Do I blame you for Zoe ? No , don 't stop . Go on . I 'm waiting for you to bring this analogy home . How is you hiring thugs - to rob and murder people . - Voice down . How is that equivalent to me being a bad mother ? I never said that . You think it 's my fault that Zoe hated me . What are you talking about ? The idea that I could control her behavior is just stupid . I mean , who are you ? What kind of man have you become ? I don 't even know you . This kid turns up poached a few hours after trying to blow up Trojan spaceport . His girlfriend is found dead in an alley across town the same night . - What do you think ? - I 'm getting used to the smell . What , dead monad ? I kind of like it . You know they went to the same school as Zoe Graystone and Ben Stark ? That 's a hell of a coincidence . I 'm gonna talk to Clarice Willow . I do understand , but why didn 't you tell me about this before ? Let 's not you and me get into this now . Just put him on the phone , okay ? Hey , Sport , what 's this mom tells me about your attitude at school ? You listen to me , no excuses . This happens again , I take things away . That 's TV , Holobands , the whole thing . Frak . Okay , buddy , I got to go . Frak ! How are you ? Well , sister , I 'm wet . Do you mind ? Yourself ? I 'm upset to learn that two of my former students have been murdered . Did you know that they were monotheists ? What 's that supposed to mean ? I think it 's a fairly straightforward question . Did you know they 're monotheists ? More to the point , did you know that they were terrorists ? You don 't sound too surprised . I am surprised . And what about you ? Have you ever attended a monad church ? I 'm the headmistress of the Athena Academy , Athena . What do you think ? I don 't know . That 's why I 'm asking you . Maybe you had a crisis of faith . - Maybe you were curious . - Don 't be absurd . That 's a no ? Thank you for your time , sister . Couldn 't have been easy getting this thing out of there . Vergis thinks I melted it down for scrap , but this might mean something to you . That 's all that 's left of the U-87 . How 's Amanda ? She 's fine . Really ? She will be fine physically , but ... I think she 's still ... still grieving . A lot of regret and guilt . She blames herself for everything that happened . It 's a shame . How about you ? You getting enough rest ? Not even remotely . - All right , I 'll leave you to it . - Thanks . I got a complaint from Clarice Willow 's lawyer , demanding that you stop harassing his client . It 's not surprising , sir . There are too many threads that connect her to this . There is an STO presence in that school , and she 's obviously protecting the students who are involved in it , but that doesn 't mean she is involved . Sir , that is pretty much the definition of involved . No , because it could be argued it 's the definition of misguided . Do you seriously believe she could be an Athenian cleric and keeping up this kind of secret life ? I do . - Your partner thinks you 're wrong ... - My partner ? And I agree with her . You 're a polytheist , quite devout , right ? - My Gods have nothing to do with this . - You 're not objective , Jordan . You should listen to your partner and back off from this . We don 't have anything on Clarice Willow . And we all want to solve these murders . - Focus on that . - Yes , sir . All in this together . I got it . Go , team . Dr. Graystone , I think we got off to a bad start . And we don 't have to be on opposite sides . You should have thought of that when you were ransacking my house . Yes , I know . You 're right and I 'm sorry . Doctor , there are people around us , these monotheists . They want nothing more than to have us either convert or destroy us . It 's not the monotheists , it 's the terrorists . I think your friend Clarice Willow is one . What ? Her students blew up that train . Yes , I 'm acutely aware of that . They 're also responsible for trying to take out that spaceport yesterday . - You heard about that ? - Yes . Listen to me . Clarice Willow lived on Gemenon as a child at the same time that the STO was actively training recruits in order to protect the new church . Now , last week on Gemenon , there was a conclave meeting and we know for a fact that Clarice was off-world at the exact same time . She was on Gemenon at a teaching conference . There was no teaching conference . I called the school . She took vacation time . Now , I believe that Clarice Willow pulled your daughter into that organization . She got her to trust her . She brainwashed her and then she put her on that train - I 'm not listening to this . No . - ... with that bomb ! Dr. Graystone . I can 't hear this anymore . - Dr. Graystone . - I 'm not gonna listen to this . I got you . Please let go of me . Why are you telling me this ? Because I need your help . You are in a unique position , Doctor . You have intimate access to an STO leader . Now , do you know what a confidential informant is ? A spy . You want me to spy on my friend ? If Clarice Willow is who I think she is , then she could be the linchpin , and we could take down the entire STO . The people who murdered your daughter . Now , if you don 't believe me , why don 't you tell Clarice Willow what I told you ? You tell her that she can call my boss . They can pull my badge , I don 't care . I 'm that sure ! Why are you being so good to me ? 'Cause I loved Zoe too . Clarice Willow lived on Gemenon the same time that the STO was actively training recruits . I 'm packing up a few things . I 'm off to Gemenon . You 're going to Gemenon ? She pulled your daughter into this organization . She brainwashed her . I think it 's all really about Zoe . Did you ask Daniel about the avatar ? These monotheists , they want nothing more than to have us either convert or destroy us . God does not want you to punish yourself . He loves you . Which God ? I need your help . Now , do you know what a confidential informant is ? You 're out early . Yeah . I couldn 't sleep , so ... I went for a drive . - Tea ? - No . I 'm gonna have something stronger . I saw you on the Holoband last night . I know . It 's my ... guilty secret of mine . I find it relaxing when I can 't sleep . So ... Who are you in there ? Depends . Different characters . It depends on the mood I 'm in , you know ? Different roles . Zoe . It 's time to call a truce . Reach out to Mother . She 'll talk to Clarice . This is a secure location . If we go to the conclave , we 'll expose ourselves , and Clarice is out for blood . She 's coming after me . She 's coming after all of us . Do you know that for sure ? - She already killed Pann and Hippolyta . - We should reach out . - We 're on the same side . - I just wanna stuff the barrel of a gun down her lying mouth ! I just want to blow her brains all over the wall and wash my hands in the blood ! I swear to God ! I can 't do this . - Not any more . - Where are you going ? Where are you going ? You 're not going anywhere now . Come back here . - Keon , please . - Keon , you 're not going anywhere . Stop . - No , I ... - Keon , do not touch that button . Don 't betray me . If you leave , they 'll find you , and you 'll lead them right back to us . No , Barnabus , please don 't . No ! Keon , please stay ! Just stay ! Please stay ! Please . Lacy is right . You 're insane . Don 't be so surprised . You 're not as hard to find as you think you are , Barnabus . Do you know what I love about our God ? He 's a kind God , and he 's a loving God and he 's a just ... - God . - Please stop . I 'm sorry it had to come to this . Others need to be taught the price of disobedience . Apotheosis is a fraud . History will absolve me . Are you gonna kill me ? I hope not . Are you all right ? Two of my students were killed . They were murdered . That 's terrible . Who would do that ? I don 't know . They were running with a bad crowd . Yeah , I know what that 's like . You know , I think you might be ... The only person I can talk to . Tell me everything .

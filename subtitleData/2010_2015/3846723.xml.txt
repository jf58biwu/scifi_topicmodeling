 Previously on Fringe ... You are looking through a window into another world . An alternate universe just like ours . And in each of them , there is a version of us . I can 't let Peter die again . I can save him . Walter , Peter is dead . I 'm talking about the other Peter . The one on the other side . I crossed into another universe and took a son that wasn 't mine . God help me . Peter Bishop ? Olivia Dunham . I 'm with the F.B.I. Your father is Walter Bishop . He worked out of Harvard in an area called Fringe science . You 're telling me my father was Dr. Frankenstein . Ask yourself why they picked you . We gave you the ability to identify things from the other universe . Was it me who described it as a glimmer ? I 'm not from here , am I ? - Son ... - I am not your son . I can take you back where you belong . Peter is in danger . Help us cross over . Walter over here is the secretary of defense . The Fringe team answers to him . - This is your team ? - Agents Francis and Dunham . These invaders from another universe can 't be trusted . You gotta trust me . I 'm you . you have to come back . Because you belong with me . They 're heading back to the opera house . Make the switch . Welcome back . Please let me out of here . Please let me out of here ! Agent Dunham , I 'm trying to help you get your life back so that you can go home , back to your life , your job , your family . This is not my home . Because you come from another universe ? Yes . Olivia ... what is happening to you , given the nature of your job , the upsetting events you come in contact with on a regular basis , coupled with the injury to your head , it 's not surprising your mind has created this fantasy ... a means of processing the trauma . This is not a fantasy . You agree you are an agent with Fringe Division . I work for the FBI in Fringe Division ... dealing with weird and mysterious events that threaten the safety of the United States and its residents . Good . Is this your mother ? She looks like her , but it isn 't her . And these ? Agent Lincoln Lee , Charlie Francis ... Are these your partners ? No . And who is this ? Another Olivia Dunham ... The Olivia Dunham from over here . And how does that sound to you , Olivia ... What you 're saying ? That there 's a world beyond this world populated with people who look exactly like the people here ? It sounds preposterous ... which is what I thought when I first learned about it , but as insane as it sounds , it 's the truth . Who 's Peter ? After you were injured outside the opera house , when you were under anesthesia , you mumbled the name " Peter . " Is he one of your friends ? The ones who came here with you from the other universe ? Peter is my colleague ... A civilian consultant . My team and I crossed over here to find him and bring him home . And where are they now ... Peter and your friends ? I don 't know . But I assume they had to go home without me . Olivia ... I know it 's really scary ... not being in control of one 's own mind . Dr. Anderson ... I am not crazy . That is not my mother . My mother died when I was fourteen . The Charlie Francis that I knew was murdered . I have never won an Olympic medal for marksmanship . None of these are me . This is not my life . You think I 'm trying to convince you you 're someone you 're not ? Why would I do that ? I don 't know . You wanted to see me , sir ? The treatments are not working . Well , that 's , uh , not such a surprise . We always knew that transferring memories was a long shot at best . Let 's try again , please . Sir , if we give her another dose ... it could kill her . You and I know something that many lives and many more dollars have been spent to keep secret . That we are at war ... At war with another universe ... populated by creatures who have damaged the very fabric of reality . All around us , our world is under attack . Somehow , this girl came here . Somehow , she is equipped to move through universes . We need her to help us understand this skill ... because if we can do it , we can win this war . And if not ... soon , there 'll be nothing left to protect . Let 's try again . Is it dinner already ? Afraid not . Please ... Please don 't do this again . I don 't feel so good . I can 't ... - I can 't breathe . - Unstrap her . Sit her up . Ah ! Code blue . Code blue . Freeze ! Come on ! Come on ! Hold it right there ! Hold it right there ! I see her ! Over there ! The White House announced that President Obama has chosen former President John F. Kennedy to lead the government 's new agency aimed at slowing ecological breakdown . President Kennedy plans to step down from his role as U.N. ambassador . Drive . I 'm gonna need your Show Me . You know I can 't put this cab into drive without your I.D. What 's your name ? Henry . Okay , listen , Henry . What I need you to do right now is I need you to drive . Okay . No , sir . Not yet . Shore patrol says there 's no way she could have made it across , that the currents are impossible this time of year . What do you think ? I think from what I know of Olivia Dunham she 's the one person I would bet on who could survive . Then find her . Why are you wearing a hospital gown ? Are you sick ? I 've been held against my will , and I 'm being pursued by a division of the government . They 've done experiments on me . They 're trying to convince me that I 'm someone that I 'm not . Is that your family ? Look , I 'm just getting my life back together . I don 't know what you 're doing , but the last thing I need now is any kind of trouble . You 're not in any trouble , Henry ... as long as you do exactly as I say . Okay , I want you to slow down just up here and park . Give me your I.D ... . Your " Show Me . " Okay , you 're gonna go into that store , and you 're gonna buy me some clothes . I now know where you and your family live . If you alert anyone , Henry , I assure you trouble will find you . I understand . Good . Knock , knock . Who 's there ? Uh , no one , 'cause you 're so ugly , no one would come to your door . Ha ha . Hey , Melissa , you know how Agent Francis can tell which end the worms living inside his body are which ? Tickles them in the middle and sees which end farts . Boom . I 'll get you some water , Lincoln . So ... What have you heard ? How much longer are they gonna keep her there ? You know Olivia . She 's strong . Physically , she 's doing a lot better . But they 're saying she had a complete psychotic break . I 've heard of people losing time , you know ? Not being able to remember the day leading up to a bad car accident . But this is crazy . And the other Olivia ? She escaped to the other side , along with the secretary 's son and the other Walter Bishop . You know , three days ago , I was eating a bowl of chocolate ice cream . I was watching Tom Cruise kick some ass on TV . I thought , " Life 's pretty good . " now all of this . I 'm afraid it 's just gotten worse . Sir . How you coming along ? I 'm doing okay . What is it ? Last night Agent Dunham escaped from the facility on Liberty Island . Nice ink . What 's it mean ? What ? Tattoo on the back of your neck . Looks like a sun of some kind . They must have done it to me . She must have one . The other one must have a tattoo . The girl they 're trying to make you believe you are ? Yeah . Yeah , that sounds right . I agree . Hey , don 't do that . Don 't placate me because you think that I 'm ... What , crazy ? And what would you think if I jacked your cab in a hospital gown with a gun , screaming a conspiracy , telling you I 'm being chased by the government and folks are trying to make me believe I 'm a tattooed version of myself . - Look , I know I sound insane . - A little bit . Well , I 'm not insane . I 'm not who they say I am . Okay . So where 're we going ? You 're taking me home . I don 't have to tell you a delusional Fringe Division agent with sensitive , classified information is of great concern . Do you have any idea where she 's gone ? Not yet . Considering her mental state , she could be anywhere . Where 're you going ? - To get my clothes . - Not you . If Olivia 's in trouble , I 'm not sitting here . I thought you had to go back to the hyperbaric chamber . I can be out for eight hours at a time . I got six hours left today . Melissa . Get my nanite wraps . If I 'm not back in fifteen minutes , you can leave . The opera house ... That 's where your home is ? No , but that 's how I got here , and that 's how I 'm gonna get back there . What 's to stop me from leaving now ? Henry Arliss Higgins ... 3248 Hastings Avenue , apartment 3 . I.D. number 10-02-25-056768 . Blood type , " B " negative . Your inoculations are up to date except for your typhus , which is seventeen days overdue . You might want to get that taken care of . Hey ! Hey ! Agent Dunham , I 'm sorry , I didn 't recognize you . I wasn 't aware that the Fringe Division was overseeing this . Oh , uh , it 's okay . I should have I.D. ' d myself . So is it , uh , true what they say about this place ? People have disappeared into thin air inside ? I know , I know . " Classified . " Things keep getting weirder and weirder all the time . If you 'll excuse me , I 'm just gonna ... Yeah , you know , we should ... we should step back . I ... I ... I 'll only be a minute . No , no . There 's no time for that . The protocol 's already in effect . - Yeah , I understand ... - Agent , Agent , you can 't . No . Anything yet ? Agent Farnsworth is running scenarios . There 's a 6 % chance that Agent Dunham will return to headquarters to surrender , an 11 % chance that she will return to attack , a 21 % chance that she will attempt to contact someone that she knows , a 29 % chance that she will return to the theater where her trauma occurred , and a 33 % chance that she will attempt to leave the country . Someone contact the borders ? - Yep . - She 's good at disguises . I 've told them that too . Agent Dunham just left the Orpheum Theater quarantine in a city taxi . Get a line on the tracker in that cab and find it . Yes , sir . So ... What now ? I don 't know yet . Can you just keep driving ? It 's my wife . Okay . Don 't do anything foolish , Henry . Hey . Yeah , yeah . I know . I never put it in there . It was in Laura 's old room . Laura 's ... Yeah . Nothing . I ... I got a fare . Okay . Around 7 : 00 ? I love you , hon . For sure . What 's her name ? Jasmine . Unless I 'm in the doghouse ... then she 's " honey . " so most of the time , it 's " honey . " What about you ? You got someone ? Sort of . That 's an odd name ... " Sort of . " His name is Peter . He 's sort of the reason I 'm here . Can you take me to 655 18th street , just off 10th Avenue ? What 's there ? - It 's a company called Massive Dynamic . - Never heard of it . They make technology that could get me home . If I 'm right , there 's a lady who works there who may be able to help me . Well , if we 're going down to Chelsea , we 're gonna need some gas . Remember . Yeah , I know . I know . You got my number . Jedi mind trick . Hey , Liv . Thank God we found you . Okay . I know I 'm not quite my handsome self , but a hello would be nice . I know about the shootout at the Orpheum . Colonel Broyles told me all about it . You know , you took a blow to your head ... Don 't you come any closer . Liv , I 'm going through it myself . Believe me , I know that the treatment can feel worse than the disease ... but they 're just trying to fix you . We all just want to help you get bet ... Liv ? Take your gun out and put it on the ground . Olivia , come on . I 've been your partner for two years . Put your gun on the ground . This isn 't necessary . Kick it over here . What do you think I 'm gonna do ? I don 't know . I don 't know you . Whatever they told you , I am not who you think I am . Liv , think about what you 're doing . You can 't just keep running . Get in the car . Get in the car ! - What are you doing ? - Just drive ! Liv ! Go , go , go , go . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! Hey ! You 're a hell of a shot . No , actually , I 'm not . Well , you could have fooled me . Hey , what are you doing ? They won 't be able to find us now . Thank you . Yeah . She must have removed the cab 's tracker . We 've tapped into the surveillance cams , but we haven 't picked anything up yet . Did you see the incident footage ? Yes , sir . Hey ! You know what I 'm thinking ? That there 's only one person at Fringe Division who could make a shot like that . It 's working . Why 'd you pull over ? This is it . 18th street , 10th Avenue ... That 's where you said . - Oh , no . - What ? It 's not here . They must never have built it . Okay , maybe you got the cross streets wrong . Let me look it up . I 'm stuck here . Are you okay ? Shadowgrove Circle ... 302 Shadowgrove Circle . It 's in Tarrytown . I ... it 's a ... It 's a safe house . Walter must have told me about it . I don 't know why I forgot . Tarrytown 's about fourty minutes from here . Okay , we better get going . Hey , Frank . Charlie , what 's up ? Do you have news about Olivia ? You mind if I come in ? Come in . He obviously means a lot to you . Excuse me ? The guy you mentioned , why you say you came here . Frank ? Yeah . I thought you said his name was Peter . Yeah . Peter . Right . You don 't look so good . How long till we get there ? Not long . I haven 't slept since this whole thing happened . I don 't even know what 's wrong with her . Nobody will even give me a straight answer . We 're gonna get her better . I promise you . We just ... We just got to find her . Can you think of something that , uh , we might have missed ... you know , um , someone else she could have gone to for help , someplace she could be hiding out , a friend , anything ? Marilyn is back in town . I thought she was in France . She came home when she heard what happened . You know , the last time I ran a fare out this far , the meter read about 300 bucks . Guess I 'll just put it on your tab . I can wait for you if you like . No , you go home to your family . You gonna be okay ? I 'm not crazy , you know . But to prove that to you I 'd have to tell you some things that were even crazier . You know , a few years ago , I was in a bad way . Couldn 't pull myself out . Inside , I knew I was somebody else . There 's only one person who believed that ... Jasmine . She saw the man I knew I was . But she was the only one . I mean , sometimes you just got to believe in what you can 't see . Thank you . Olive ? Mom . Sweetheart . Oh ! I know what happened . They told me about your breakdown . I came home as soon as I heard . I tried to see you , but they wouldn 't let me . Sweetheart , I 've been so scared . I 'm not your daughter . My mother died when I was fourteen years old . This is all wrong . - You 're not supposed to be here . - Sweetheart ! Don 't you call me that . I am not your daughter . Yes , you are . You 're just confused . This was going to be my way home . This is your home . No , my home is in Jacksonville , Florida . I was ... I was brought up on an army base . I 've never been here before ! If you 've never been here , how did you know to come here ? I helped you paint , didn 't I ? Yes . You picked the colors . I wanted blue , but you convinced me to use ... Yellow , because it was more cheerful . Sweetheart ... This is your home . This is your safe house . Oh . Sorry to bother you , Mrs. Dunham . Just , um , wondering if you heard from Olivia . She 's here . She is ? Come on in . Hey . Olivia Dunham has been recovered . It appears that your treatments have taken effect after all . Your plan was sound . They just needed a bit more time than you assumed . No , it wasn 't time . It was the adrenaline from her escape . The adrenaline triggered our Olivia 's memory " B " lymphocytes . It carried them across the blood-brain barrier and successfully transferred the memories , which means for all intents and purposes ... she is our Olivia now . Thanks , Charlie . For what ? For being my friend . Hey , Liv ? Yeah ? Thank you for not shooting me . Aw . Give her the weekend . After that , she should be fine to go to work . Then I assume this is the time to ask you , " Why ? " Why convince her she 's our Olivia Dunham ? Why is it necessary ? You don 't need to worry about that just yet . You 'll know soon enough . Due respect , Mr. Secretary , you 're embedding one of them on my team , and you 've embedded my agent with them . I need to know now . Good work today , Phillip . And that 's what you call him ... " Walternate " ... Your real father ? Yeah . Okay , go on . Well , Walternate took me over there because he said he needed me to help him fix the damage on the other side . But you believed he was lying to you . Yeah , he ... He never had any intention to ... to fix the other side . He wanted me to help him destroy ours . Hmm . " Hmm , " what ? Pen 's dying . Here , give it to me . I know a trick . A trick ... to save a dying pen ? Do you want me to fix it or not ? Ah , it 's okay . We 're almost finished here . I just have one more question . Um , you said when you learned Walternate was lying to you , your first thought was anger , that you wanted to put a stop to his agenda . But you could have done that by staying there . So the one thing I don 't understand is ... why 'd you come back ? You know , I haven 't seen those in a while ... Your shoes . Wallabees . Are you bringing them back ? Where did they go ? Oh , good . He 's done . How was it ? It was endless , but it 's over now . We can get on with our lives . Great . How about we start with dinner ? I 'm starving . And the whole time I was in there , there was only one thing I could think about . Yeah ? What ? That . Let 's go . I 'm sure tomorrow will bring the usual insanity . May as well enjoy a night off .

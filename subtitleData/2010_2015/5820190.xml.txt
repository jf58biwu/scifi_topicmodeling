 MOLLY : I went to space on a 13-month solo mission . I didn 't come home alone . My husband created a lifelike android called a humanich . His name is ethan . He 's the prototype . This is a story about earth . Ethan ! A story about family . A story about surviving . Previously on extant ... ( BEEPS ) Harmon . He 's gone . Every time your baby has created An alternate reality , he 's had an agenda . He 's alone and afraid in a world That he just doesn 't understand . And he needs his mother to save him . I came all the way here because I trusted you . Daddy , whose side are you on ? You have to choose . ( GRUNTS ) SPARKS : It 's over . He 's gone . Do not recover the ship . JACKSON : You covered up your own daughter 's death . And sent our people into harm 's way . You have to understand how powerful that being is . FRENCH ASTRONAUT : This is the triomphe . We just performed a retrieval . It appears to be an isea-issue craft . Sean glass ? You found an escape pod ? There was only a faint signal . No signs of life ... Until we opened it . Sean . Katie ? KATIE : I don 't feel like myself . I thought you were dead , katie . We were told everyone was killed in the fire . There was no fire . I left the aruna drifting with its crew . Or what was left of them . It was ... Like a ... Like a madness ... That spread like a virus . And I told myself that the people that I knew ... You knew most of them , too ... They weren 't themselves anymore . They were killing each other . What the hell was it ? I have no idea . I just had this feeling that it wasn 't from earth . From us . I put myself in the vite-pod And programmed it for a medical coma . There was no way that I was gonna be rescued in time . But you were . Yeah . By the freakin ' french . 23 months . I know . It 's a miracle . JACKSON : He 's sleeping . He just killed a man . He said I did something . What does that mean ? We know what he did . He fooled us . He only came back to gain access to our internal network . He logged in for two minutes before you stopped him . This is our deep orbit com-sat array . Sparks inserted code that flipped it into a systems check . We have no way to contact our missions till it cycles through . What about the seraphim ? In the dark another few hours . I 've authorized a rescue mission to evacuate sean glass As soon as we get our come back . Any theories why sparks would do this ? I don 't know . Could there be others helping him ? Well , I helped him . When we were At the cabins , he showed me something I wanted to see . He made me think I was entering codes into an incubator , But I think I was entering codes into another system . And only sparks knows what those codes are . Talk to him . And take this . He hasn 't been told , yet . Okay . We found her last night . And there 's no sign of my son . Talk to me before this gets any worse . Looking at a-a picture like that , it 's ... Hard not to give in to your emotion . Give in ? You love her ! She was your wife . It 's temporary . See , your boy ... He always gives back what he takes away . I 'll see her again . ( SIGHS ) What did I do at the cabins ? You were there , you watched me . If I did something terrible , I need to know what it is . You 're a broken woman , molly . Losing katie , that broke who I was . But it made me strong enough to do what I had to do . You lost a family with marcus . That 's the world we live in . Life breaks us ... So it can make us stronger . But what if you didn 't ever have to break ? What if you could be made whole again ? You deserve that . We all do . And we 're going to get it . I 'm gonna get my own answers . Com-sat is down . So the craziest , best v-chron in the history Of earth-bound messages is gonna have to wait . Is it terrible that I 'm happy I might get to wash my hair first ? Building a fort with the tools ? Fixing my bed . You 're a terrible host . We all had to do grief counseling , you know . With washburn ? Uh , new guy . He said I processed your death very well . Always the overachiever . Did you tell him everything about us ? I told him we were close during training . That you got drunk and kissed me one night . And I may have spent eight months chasing that moment . He didn 't push , because I was grieving so fantastically . You didn 't make it easy for me . To do what ? Make me feel invisible ? Your dad didn 't run the program . There was nothing I could do . How is my dad ? Is he okay ? He 's gonna be now . I 've got to go . You gonna be all right ? Yes . Will you come back ? Of course . We 're friends , right ? Friends stick together . But if anything happens ... What do you mean ? You know what I mean . If your dad ... If john takes you to the lab , and you think ... If you really think they 're gonna do something radical ... My parents would never shut me down . And you really believe that ? You ask them , they won 't admit it , but ... They don 't really see you as part of the family . Julie told me your mom 's having a lot of trouble . Maybe they just see you as different . I don 't have to be . They probably won 't do anything , But if you think that 's what 's going on , I want you to get in touch with me . How ? This is a very special phone , But it 's only for use in emergencies . We use them at war . Now ... You press this button and I 'm gonna know it 's you , I 'm gonna know how to find you , And I 'm gonna come straight away . Really ? Mm-hmm . But only press it When you 're in the lab and it 's really happening . You heard about the boy who cried " wolf " ? Hmm . That 's a story for another time . Oh . ( CHUCKLES ) Hey , man . No hugs . Soldiers salute . ( RHYTHMIC BEEPING ) The com-sat orbit is out at a two minute radio delay . If the array is back up on schedule , We should start receiving signals from our stations In just a few moments . How soon can we get sean off the seraphim ? There 's a gamma seven series prepping to launch Once sean can verify he 's received your message And confirms the system 's status . BEN : Twenty seconds . I believed as a kid , you know . They teach you the drake equation , They teach you it 's impossible odds To make contact with an alien intelligence . But I knew we weren 't alone . Did you believe in ufo 's as a kid ? Believe in ' em ? I wanted to fly ' em . ( CHIRPING , BEEPING ) Thank god , they 're back . Seraphim 's still dark . I.D. Seraphim . BEN : Com-sat is not receiving any signals from the seraphim . The seraphim station is no longer in its predicted orbit . Well , it can 't just be gone . Something happened when the com-sats were down . Ben , query the data log from the seraphim before we lost contact . BEN : On screen . There 's one transmission from an earth-based terminal . From here ? It was remote access . Not here . When ? 19 hours ago . I was at the cabins . ( BABY CRYING , ALARM BEEPING ) It was me . I was sending codes to the seraphim . Codes for what ? Well , what did you do ? I made it disappear . What the hell is happening up there ? I don 't know . Sync Corrected By MicLatu Occam 's razor . What is the simplest theory ? Forget all the assumptions About what 's happened to the seraphim . What do we know ? We know I logged into the isea , And I entered codes . Okay , could you , could you ... Change the course on the seraphim ? I mean , I-is that why it 's missing ? There 's only a limited number of things You can do from a remote terminal . And steering a ship isn 't one of them . Okay , could you , did you blow it up ? Is it gone ? My gut tells me it 's off course . I-I just can 't remember what I did . Okay , molly , we keep saying you did this . You were coerced , You were tricked . Okay . What if the baby did it ? What 's his purpose ? I 'm gonna make a very unscientific assumption here . My gut says we 'll never be able to understand its purpose Because it 's not like us . Well , it 's got to be partly like us , no ? Why is it so hard for you to believe That it 's just using you Li-li-like a pawn on a chessboard ? I mean , it-it kills , it-it manipulates . It 's a , it 's a cold-blooded predator . There 's got to be an explanation here , john . He can 't just be that . Why not ? Because I 'm in him . He came from me . What are you guys talking about ? Nothing . It 's really nothing important . I didn 't know you were up already . Okay , I got to go to work . Can I come with you ? No , you 're gonna stay home with dad today , okay ? Mom ? Were you and dad Talking about me ? No , sweetheart . It had nothing to do with you . I 'll see you later . ( DOOR OPENS ) ( DOOR CLOSES ) What are you doing ? Ben said the terrestrial Communications system is down . It 's global , so I 'm guessing It 's an antenna problem . You want some help ? I 'm handy . You are helping . You 're here . When they know you have ... Whatever it is , That makes you good at these solo missions , they Can 't send you on enough of them . You get so used to being alone , You forget there 's another way to be . I know it seems obvious , but I 'm basically trained To not connect to people . It 's nice to know I 'm not great at that . Does that make any sense ? So I 'm lost in space for 23 months , And I 'm rescued against all odds And I 'm brought here ... And it 's all about you ? Exactly . I 'd like to be alone now . ( LAUGHS ) BEN : Sean , I think I 've found The problem with the antenna system . There was an overheat alert Near the n-channel power bus . So the power supply fried and shut off all our antennas ? Yes . A good guess . Can we fix that ? We have to . Out here , without our antennas , We are officially more alone Than any other humans in the universe . CHARLIE : Did you see the gap ? " The gap " ? Yeah , 87 minutes . Yesterday ethan 's power core Almost zeroed out . 11 : 45 to 1 : 12 . He was with odin at john 's house . With john ? No . They were alone Till I came to pick him up . Look . I know you like this guy ... Maybe ethan asked for a flip And he did it wrong . It can 't hurt him . Did he toggle into interlude mode ? Yeah . But if I 'm watching a one-of-a-kind , sentient android , I might mention if I let him run out of power . For 90 minutes . Is ethan okay ? He seems okay , but we should probably Check him out , tell john . Fine . You entered codes that sent The seraphim off course ? I just have a hazy memory of what I entered . ( STAMMERS ) wait , are you gonna Put that in my neck ? It 's a memory enhancer , molly . I can 't really inject it into your ass . You know , this can 't bring back Memories that don 't exist . But it can make existing ones Much more clearer . Okay . The brightener only has a momentary effect . It 's kind of like a sneeze . So you 'll have to focus on the exact cloudy memory That you want enhanced . Okay . All right , relax . Close your eyes . Focus . Are you focused on the memory ? Just focus ... I will if you just ... Stop talking . Ten ... Nine ... ( BABY CRYING , ALARM BEEPING ) ... Seven ... Six ... BEN : It 's just some code . I 'll dictate , you enter . Start with your access code . Okay , okay , okay ! It 's going to be fine . Five ... Four ... Three ... Two ... One . Go . ( BABY CRYING ) Okay . ( DINGS ) BEN : Everything taken care of . I see numbers ! Give-give me something to write ! Oh , my god . Write it down Before the brightener fades . ( MUTTERS ) Okay . Oh , god . Are you okay ? I saw marcus . And I was holding the baby . It was real . Sam , it was so real . I know this is gonna sound crazy . But do you think there 's any way That what I saw could actually Be real ? Do you mean more than an hallucination ? Yes . I don 't ... I don 't know what to say . Okay . I 'm gonna go talk to ben . I think he 's the only one who can help me Understand what these commands mean . Thanks . Molly ? Who am I to say what 's real ? If you held your baby , Then you held your baby . Ben , simulate the access level limits For a remote terminal log on . Of course . Okay , I 'm gonna enter some coordinates . See if you can make any sense of these . Parse them at three digits . Maybe they were coordinates for a new course . You wouldn 't have had clearance to give The seraphim new way-points from a remote terminal . Okay , ben , so how could these 20 characters Have changed the course of a ship ? Could you have sent sean glass a coded message ? Like what ... " turn the ship " ? Would you like me to try common ciphers ? Sure . Go ahead . Wait , hold on a second . Maybe you were right about sending a message . Parse three groups of three digits . Single digit , double digit . They are coordinates . And they have vectors , too . Position , direction and speed . Ben , if there were an immediate threat to the seraphim ... Say a real emergency situation ... Would I have been able to warn it from a remote terminal ? Wouldn 't that make it change its course ? It would be exactly like yelling , " turn the ship . " Asteroids . I didn 't change the course of the seraphim Because I couldn 't . But what I could do was tell the onboard nav-com There were asteroids on a collision course with it . So it entered into an avoidance protocol To avoid asteroids that didn 't exist . Wait . If the seraphim Deviated its course to here , It would 've passed fairly near another station . Who is that ? This is commander pierre lyon of the triomphe . We received your message . Unfortunately we lost contact with the seraphim , And do not know about its current location . However ... We have returned to them yesterday This woman And the aruna rescue pod in which she was found . PIERRE : Hey . You feeling better , yes ? It was a very long sleep . MAN : Katie ? Smile . A little wave ? Hi . JACKSON : The french returned her to us yesterday . MOLLY : She 's been drifting For almost two years . It 's a miracle , alan . But a different kind of miracle . She shows up on this video because she 's real . She 's alive . I want to see her . I do , too . But she 's on the seraphim . We 've lost all contact . Now I remember That you had me take the seraphim off course . But I don 't remember where I sent it . I can 't . She was alive this whole time , Alan . Now , you need to help us . The seraphim is Falling out of its orbit . What ? It 's coming back to earth . It 'll disintegrate As soon as it hits the atmosphere . How could you make me do that ? ! He said it was necessary . Why ? ! I don 't know . Oh , please ... Save my daughter . I 'll tell you what you want to know . Sparks gave us enough to calculate The last position and heading . We should be able to intercept it , Assuming it hasn 't changed course again . We need to get someone up there as soon as possible . Who are you gonna sending ? Well , you 've got more solo hours On the seraphim than anyone else . Me ? You want me to go ? After everything that 's happened ? It 's because of everything that 's happened That I want you to go . No one knows that ship as well as you . My problems are down here , not up there . You 've got other qualified candidates . None of them are you . I don 't want to go to the lab . I don 't either , but we need To do a systems check . You shouldn 't have let Your batteries get so low . I didn 't . Ethan , I 'm really not upset with you , okay ? Is this about your argument ? Sometimes I-I just don 't understand your mother . Do you understand me ? I want to go home ! We have to do this today , okay ? I don 't want to talk about it anymore . All right , bud . Get comfortable . This is gonna take a second . My dad said it was just a systems check . Well , today we 're gonna do a deep scan . I 've never done that before . Well , you 're getting more complex . There 's more to check as you get older . But the worst part is ... Is you Are gonna have to wear ... The dufus cap . Wow . Nothing , huh ? Okay . Come on . I 'm not wearing that . Come on , it 's not that bad . No . I promise . No ! Come on ... Hey , rabbit . Where 's my dad ? He 's gonna come in at the end to see how we did . I don 't want to do it . I 'm not wearing that . Give us a minute ? Um ... Yeah . You okay ? You seem really scared . What 's wrong , rabbit ? I know what you 're trying to do . I know my mom and dad want to shut me down . Shut you down ? Why would they want to do that ? So that he can re-program me So I 'm like other kids . JULIE : No way , ethan . No one wants to shut you down . Your parents love you . We all love you . But I 'm a machine . We 're all machines . I 'm half motors , half muscles . Who cares what we are ? If you can love something , Than you can be loved . That 's how it works . Who told you they wanted to shut you down ? Odin . ( DRILL WHIRRING ) What are you doing ? I thought you were lying down . 23 months was enough . ( SIGHS ) Earth antennas are shot . Protocol says I gotta prep the escape pod . Why ? A party . I 'm gonna hang a disco ball , Invite the french . ( BOTH LAUGH ) We gotta go , katie . If we can 't contact earth , we need to evac the ship In a reentry vehicle within 24 hours . Problem is , Our spare oxygen generators Are stuck in the shed And I can 't get the doors open . We 've been having a fungus problem up here . I 'm thinking that 's what 's messing up the controls . Sean ... Hey , hey ... What 's the matter ? I can 't get in a pod again . I-I can 't .

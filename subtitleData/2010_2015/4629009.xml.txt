SO lucky ! Ah what you call luck I call , well , luck . Hey , fancy tricks are no substitute for fundamental driving . Here comes the magic ! MY KITCHEN ! Ta-da ... Dude , you destroyed our cars . At least he wasn 't behind the wheel of a REAL car . Hey if I were driving my car , I totally would have been able to pull that off . Uh , doesn 't that require you to have a car ? What do you call that ? ... a disaster waiting to happen ? Oho , yeah you know what , just wait until I get her fixed up . What 's stopping ya ? A titanium super-charged turbo crank shaft X39 . You can 't find them anywhere ! Trust me . I have looked ! Okay then . The things I do for that kid . Holey moley ! What is that smell ? ! What 's all this ? ? root cups ! I have to move all the excess stock before it spoils ! Hm . Not getting a lot of costumers ? Define " a lot " . More than one . Then no . Not a lot . What 's with the truck ? Well I was out , being awesome , like I tend to do , and I found this truck ! Can you believe somebody just abandoned it ? I can believe it . And I thought : " Wow ! It 's a nice truck . It 'd be perfect for Jacob . " You know , he could use it to sell his food around Motorcity . That 's actually a good idea ! I know I rock . And we can even add some awesome lasers and blast away the competition ! BLAM BLAM BLAM No , there he is . You know with a bit of work , this could be a pretty cool ride . It 's already in better shape than Chuck 's car . You know what , wait until I get it on the road then you 'll see what cool is ! Then let 's get it on the road ! What happened to you ? Just helping our buddy out . What 's a Burner without a ride , right ? Hoho , wow , you actually found ... wow , this is Oh , wait , no oh no , gosh , look at this ! Oh this is the wrong part , see , it 's just the X3 , i need the X39 . I really appreciate the effort and all but it .. Oooh gee , look at that , yaaaay ... BLAM BLAM BLAM You okay buddy ? You barely said ... AH LOOK OUT Hey ! Ah that wasn 't so ... BRAKE BRAKE BRAKE BRAKE BRAKE BRAKE Allow me to present : The Duke of Detroit Ah great , not this guy again ... Get back ! HEY ! Ts ts , you thought I wouldn 't know and now I will be taking my part back . YOUR part ? ! I found this in a scrapyard 13 miles from your territory ! Every yard in Motorcity is my territory . Alright , stop ! Just , take the stupid part . Woah ! Do you know what I went through to get that ? It 's not worth it . Now that 's using your noggin to save yourself a floggin ' yeaah ~ What about your car ? I do .. don 't , you know , don 't worry about it . You don 't have to roll over ! I got two punch-sticks right here ! You mean , arms ? No , YOU mean arms , I mean PUNCH-STICKS ! Come on man , we all got your back ! Hey , I 'm doing the Duke a FAVOR , I mean , he doesn 't want my car on the road , guys .. Say that again ? ! Ii-I don 't even know what I just said ! He said you 're scared . Scared ? ! Scared of what ? That he 'd beat you in a race . Ahaha , MIKE A race ? A race is beneath a driver of my taleeeents ~ YEAH ! Chuck will beat anyone you put against him , anywhere , anytime . Haha you know , I don 't know ... Name.Your.Stakes. You win , you 'll get Chuck 's car . But when Chuck wins , we get unlimited access to any yard in Motorcity . That 's not a fair wager ! Shsh , it 's okay , I know . You deserve better than him . Your ride speaks my language . Put her in the pot , and we got a deal . Mike , we should really tal ... You 're on . Or , you can do that . Purrrrrrfect . How about a best-of-three on a course of my choosing . Sounds fun . Fun ? ! Oh there 's just one rule : ~ THE HOTSHOT HAS GOT TO BE BEHIND THE WHEEEEL ~ Bring it , don 't sing it . We will be in touch . It 's a thing of beauty . Alright , let 's see how she sounds . This a mean mean-machine ... ? of my scraptails Ohoh , sounds like Jacob could use some help fixing up the new truck . Lasers ? Uh , sure ? SCORE ! You 're sort of freaking me out . I have a problem . Is it your nine toes ? No ! It 's ... Your shy bladder ? No , you 're not listening ... Your kitten phobia ? NO ! Hey why would you even bring that up ? Look , I 'm running out of choices here man , I really don 't know what you 're trying to tell me . I 'm trying to tell you ... Dude , I don 't know how to drive ! But you are around cars everyday ! You ever see me drive one ? What if I can 't do it . If the guys knew I couldn 't drive , what would they think then ? I mean heck , I 'd throw myself out of the gang ... They 'll never know , I promise . Though I wish you would have told me before I bet Mutt . Now it 's gonna be much harder to win . Win ? ! How am I gonna win the race ? I 'm gonna train you . Train me ? Dude , there 's not enough time ! Enough time for a crash course ! CRASH course ? ! Do you even listen to yourself , when you speak ? No ! No it 's never going to happen , absolutely not , no no no no no no ... . Is the screaming really necessary ? IT 'S MY PROCESS ! Got it ? Oh , absolutely ! Just one question , when you 're holding the steering wheel , how firmly do you grip it , I mean 3 / 4 pressure , 25 % , full pressure ? ... just get in the car . Now THIS is a little move I like to call " The Sidewinder " . No no nooo ... Mikey ... Ready for your turn ? Okay , good try , good try . One more time . Aaand , again . Again . This time without the crying . Hah . I 'd like to see you try that ! I think we better find a Plan B. Guys , we 've got a problem . Oh don 't worry he 'll learn , I MEAN , heeehey you . Uhm , what 's up with the car ? You know , it 's ... j-just resting . Whatever . Uh , you need to see this . SUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAY The Duke of Detroit presents : carnage , mayhem , action , come on down to my brand-new race ring to see those poor little Burners get their cars crushed ! What 's with the goon squad ? You said , he could beat ANY of my drivers . Well there they are . Every.single.one. They 're all gonna race ? I am nothing if I 'm not Crazy ? ... thorough . All my drivers against your man ? Sounds like a party to me ! Say AUWH ! AUWH ! I can 't do this I can 't do this I can 't do this ! That wasn 't our bet Duke . But it wasn 't NOT our bet . It doesn 't break our one and only rule : HE has to be behind the wheel . ~ Now let me hear you say : ~ Haha , great , you 're both here . Hold up . Whatch 'you think ? Aaah , it 's ... great . Uh , you don 't like it ? He loves it . It 's great , really . Just give us a second , will you ? Yeah , SURE . Only spend all night working on it but ... whatever . This is never going to work ! I 'm gonna lose , people are going to laugh at me , the gang 's going to hate me , YOU 're going to lose Mutt and I was just about to level up on " Laserswords 3 : Rise Of The Vanquished " ! I think I just found our Plan B. Gentlemen ! I 'd like to introduce you to my best driver . What 's all this ? This is the perfect venue to sell my ? cups before they spoil ! You mean these haven 't spoiled already ? Ew . We probably should have tested this . You 're probably right . Maybe we should reconsider ! Ohoho PLEASE , I know what you 're thinking Mikey ! Then you better hold on ! Not one sale ? Not one ? There 's hope yet ! Are these ... I.O.U.s ? You bought food from yourself ? ! Duh , how else was I gonna get Not-Hungry ? I think it 's great what you 're doing for Chuck . Technically it 's not che ... I mean , WHAT am I doing for Chuck ? You 're being a good friend ! Risking your car just to help Chuck win some self-confidence , well it 's sweet ! I just hope you know what you 're doing . Hey Mike ! Oh , hey . Why aren 't you watching with the rest of us ? We 're just over there . Uh , you know , uh , superstition . Superstition ? Yea-ah , I stood here yesterday and he won , so ... you know what , it 's , it 's a guy thing . That 's , uh ... Yeah , that 's odd . Excuse me . Pardon me . Oh-oh . Mike ? MIKE ! Okay , this isn 't fun anymore , you can start driving now ! Come on ! That is so not fair ! OH SWEET BABY CLAPTRAPS I can 't look , I CAN 'T LOOK ! Make it stop , Mikey MIKEY , MAKE IT STOP MAKE IT STOOOP ! It was never supposed to be this close ! You were supposed to take him out of the race ! Duke , DUKE , the K-k-k-kid ! He 's not driving ! Chilton 's been using a remote ! Remote-controlled car ? Yeah Duke . I 've seen it myself . That clever , clever monkey . Oh it 's okay baby we 'll be together soon , I promise ! Oh what was that ? Noo , I wouldn 't lie to you . What if it doesn 't work ? It has to work I can 't lose Mutt . Or ... you , of course . Let 's get this party started ! I hope you 've enjoyed yourselves thus far , at least as much as I 'm going to enjoy driving Mutt home tonight . Huh , feeling cocky are we ? Oh Heavens to Betsy no . Never cocky . Just confident . ? Chuck , you got this . I mean not like I would , but still . Oh silly me , I forgot to mention there will be a replacement in today 's race . My driver seems to have suffered a catastrophic injury . He seems fine to me . I 'll be taking his place . I thought " racing was beneath your talents " ? Well this morning I 'm feeling ... inspired . What 's the matter ? Nervous ? Chuck will win no matter who 's driving your freak show ! ... care to put a wager on that ? I 'll put MY car into the pot . Care to match me ? Deal ! Get back ! Consider it oooon ~ You guys shouldn 't have done that . What were you thinking ? ! What , you bet your cars ! Come on guys , these ? cups aren 't gonna sell themselves ! ... you telling me . It 's going to be FINE , I promise . It doesn 't matter who 's driving HIS car , so long as I 'm driving yours . Texas bet his car too ? ! I couldn 't stop him . Why not ? ! Trust me , okay . Chuck can 't lose ! He lost the last race . Have you even thought about what happens if Chuck WINS ? The only thing crazier than the Duke is his temper ! Think about it ! Uh , anytime Mike . Uhm , working on it ! Hey what 's going on ? ! Let 's go ! Chuck I need you to do exactly what I say ! You know what we did yesterday ? Aaah , I blocked out yesterday ! Just sit on the gas , I 'll do the rest . No matter what , DO NOT take your foot off that pedal . Get rid of that truck ! Yes Duke ! Chuck , I need you to listen to me . The course is straight . Just hold the wheel tight . Remember where the turbo boost is ? Yeaaah . Use it ! What are you gonna do ? ... improvise . You 're home-free Chuck ! See-ya , wouldn 't wanna be ya ! Hit the brakes ! Can 't ! We 'll lose , I 'm going to try the Sidewinder . Okay , just remember the MOST important thing I taught you , wha ... Wha .. ? What 's the most important thing ? ! ? Darn darn darn darn darn ! Huh , I can 't believe you pulled that off ! Oh you mean ... I 'm alive ? ! You WON ! I won ? I WON ! Hahaha , I won ! I don 't wanna do that again . I 'm a man of my word . Wait . I already got a car . I can 't believe it ! We , we , I , it 's just I ... hah , thank you . You don 't have to thank me . I 'm your friend ! And , and you won 't tell anyone ? Under two conditions : One , you keep taking lessons from me . You could be a great driver ! It 's just going to take a lot of work . A lot of work , like , a loooooot of work . Okay yeah , I get it . I get it . So what 's the second condition ?

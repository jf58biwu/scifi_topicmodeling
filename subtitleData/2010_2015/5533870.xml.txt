Yeah , it 's a strange one , all right . - Yeah . - Squeamish ? ( Nolan ) No . ( Smith ) No ? - ( Nolan laughing ) No . - Good to know . OK , let 's get on with this .

( Reporter on radio ) ... last night , arrived at the scene , the men were no longer on board . With bad weather set to hamper tomorrow 's search , the hope of finding the missing fishermen alive has grown bleaker by the hour . Officials believe the crew of the Sea Harvester were washed overboard ... Hi . I 'm just looking for an iron . - Yeah , I 'll just go and hoke it out , yeah ? - Great . Thanks . Hiya . Hi . Now , that 's you . - Thanks . - That gets very hot , - so just keep it moving , yeah ? - OK , thank you . See you tomorrow . As a woman to a man , now , I tell you , O 'Shea , there 's a twinkle in the eye there for you . - What ? - He 'll be up in a minute . ( 50055 ) Do you like her ? She 's all right . Bit uptight . You should balk to her . I do balk to her . I mean talk to her . - Leave him off , Una . - Do you listen to him ? Eight years I was waiting for him to go down on his knee . Have you ever heard the like of it ? My family thought I was mad wasting my time on him . Ah , Keck ' ham . Ah , feck you , Brian . Same again ? Go on . What is it , Paddy ? Wouldn 't you like to know ? ( Exhaling ) Not really , no . - You would , though . - No . - Not really . - ( Paddy ) You would . If you were to know what I know , you 'd want to know . All right , tell us , then . Right , so , between you and me , I caught meself a sea monster today . Swear to God , may he strike me down . You don 't believe me ? - Not a bit . - I am no liar .

Ignorant bollix . - What ? - Huh ? - What did you say ? - Nothing . Didn 't say a word . He called you a bollix . Listen , you , if this wasn 't the only feckin ' pub on this shitting ' island , I 'd piss in it sooner than come in here . Hne . You 're barred . Ah , I 'm joking . Come on , now .

( Paddy yelling , creature squealing ) ( Yelling , squelching ) ( Clears throat ) - Lisa herself . - Eml , do I have something to sign ? 0h , yes , the big one . Thanks . - Looks like it should be nice out . - Oh , there 's a storm coming . Really ? Are the gulls ﬂying low or something ? No . It was on the telly . - You 're not married , Lisa , are you ? - No . Like O 'Shea . Well , widowed . - Widowed ? - He wouldn 't tell you . No . He 's very a private fella . With a few drinks and a nod , it might come out , but not normally , no . There 's no need for him to be here , really . I think it 's a bit of a sabbatical . Now , if you need at any stage a bigger bed , I 've a lovely room , the honeymoon suite , usually we call it , up the back of the hotel . - It 's very quiet . - No , thank you . We have much bigger beds if there 's two instead of one , you know , yourself . - Because next week we 've ... - OK . ... a huge stag party from Dublin , so if you want a bigger room , now 's to book it . - OK . Thank you . Goodbye . - All right , Lisa . Have a great day . Thank you . Morning ! ( Groaning ) Nice place you got here . Close to the beach , all mod cons . What happened ? Section 4.1 of the Public Order Act . It is an of fence for any person to be present in any public place while intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension ... - You arrested me . - Enll ... You passed out before I could find your house . ( signing ) ( Telephone ringing ) Garda Nolan . But I get a reward for discovering it ? A finder 's fee ? We 'll discuss it later . But I get something , right ? ( Door Opening ) Ah . Huh ? - ( O ' 5hea ) Eurgh . - Oh . Is that your professional opinion ? A grabber . - A what ? - I 've told you , Paddy , I 'm not calling it that . It needs a name that defines its genus . I discovered it . I get to name it . - Right . Hi . - Hi . Hi . - ( Nolan clears throat ) - Hello . - What is that thing ? - I haven 't a clue . I 've never seen anything like it before . It 's a completely foreign species . I can 't even begin to originate or class it . A grabber . Paddy . - This attacked you ? - Stuck on the ceiling , it was . Nearly ripped me throat out . - It 's dead , right ? - I 'm ... I 'm not sure . You 're not what ? Basic tests I 've done so far have shown up nothing usual or nonnal . It is beyond mystifying . I mean , really , I can 't be sure without opening it up . Ah . ' Tis dead . Would you stop doing that ? Is it any wonder it bit you ? That is its tongue . Check it out . ( Paddy ) It spits like a frog , and strangles you . Whippet fast and sharp . I 'm guessing this creature bleeds its prey like a leech , consuming the blood like some son of Vampyroteuthis . Vampyro what ? Vampyroteuthis . It 's a ... It 's a ... It 's a rare deep-sea squid . But , no , this is not that , no . No , this is something totally different . Something ... Something alien . You know , in that it 's undocumented , not from ... - It 's gotta be worth a fortune . - But , er ... But , er ... But here 's the thing . When I tried to , er , clean some dirt off it ... - I stood on it a few times . - Yes . This happened . ( Hissing ) What does that mean ? All this thing needs to survive is blood and water . Could you put it on the eBay , do you think ? You 're ... You 're not putting this on eBay . You are so lucky she didn 't kill you . - She ? - Yeah , it 's a ... Sorry . EXCUSE me . Yeah , it 's a , er ... It 's a female , from what I can tell . How can you tell ? How can I tell ? Well , it 's got no testicles . - And ... - It takes a scientist to realise that . Indeed , O 'Shea . She was pregnant . - Christ . - ( Nolan chokes , coughs ) - That 's disgusting . - A small ﬂy in the ointment there , Smith . How did that big egg come out of that ? Mother Nature 's a mysterious woman , isn 't she ? Incredibly beautiful . Are you related ? ( 0'Shea ) Do you think that grabber thing could have anything to do with those dead whales ? - ( Nolan ) What makes you say that ? - It 's just a hunch , you know . - ( Nolan ) You get hunches now ? - Well , I watch a lot of Columbo . - Why have we stopped ? - That 's Declan Cooney 's car . Coonev ! ( Nolan ) Where could he be ? ( 0'Shea ) Nowhere without his keys . Hmm . Do you believe in coincidences ? - Not really . - Neither do I. Come on . All the lights are on . So how come you 're not in uniform ? - It 's Sunday . - Ah . And neither are you . Suits you . You look nice . - Smith 's a nice fella , isn 't he ? - Oh ... Positively smashing . He 's a proper gentleman . And such polite company . Yeah . Yeah , he 's like you . Married to his job . I 'm not ... I take pride in my work . - Unlike you . - Shhh . I 'm working . You 're looking in the wrong place , Columbo . OK , hold it steady . You 're something else , you know that ? Should have joined the army , not the guards . Stop talking to yourself . It 's very distracting . I 'm not talking to meself . I 'm talking to you . Uh-huh . Great . There 's something up here . Could you , er , be a bit more specific ? ( Sniffs ) Oh ! It stinks like that thing . It 's stuck on something . ( Screams ) Jesus ! ( Grunts ) Jesus ! God , me nose ! It 's a head ! Are you OK ? O ' 5hea ! - What killed him , Jim ? - The fact that he 's just a head . You bring me someone with a head cold or a headache and I could do something . But you bring me just a head and you 're taking the piss . Jesus , they could bury him in a shoe box . Doctor , we need to know . He was mauled in some way by some animal or ... something , I don 't know . ' A tiger ? ' A tiger ? We can 't put that in a report . But I 'm a country doctor , for God 's sake . Where am I going to run across stuff like this every day of the week ? Christ . Wait till I tell you . Jesus , Paddy . What is it ? ( Paddy ) How am I supposed to wash meself ? ( O 'Shea ) OK . Here 's where Cooney 's car was abandoned , here 's Tadhg and Irene Murphy 's house , here 's where the whales washed up and we 're here . I was hoping it would show some sort of pattern . It 's the letter . The letter zed . Did you show that thing to anyone else before we saw it ? Well , Tadhg Murphy got a look of it before I brought it down . It gawked on him . Why ? We think there might be another one of those things . At least one , anyway . - Are you serious ? - Yeah . That thing you caught couldn 't have fertilised that egg by itself . Which would mean there 's a male out there , big enough and strong enough to knock a hole in your bathroom wall . Smith said it needs water , right ? - Says a lot of things . - Mostly bollocks . Whatever . But if it needs water to survive , how could it be moving about on dry land ? It was raining . When it 's raining , there 's no such thing as dry land . There 's a storm due tonight . It 'll piss it down . OK , all of this , this area , must be its territory , which ... which would mean it 's got to be somewhere with access to the waters - around the West Beach . - Black Rock Caves . I caught the female just beyond there . You know what 's to blame for all this ? Global warming . You got your icebergs melting , and your thingamajigs ﬂooding . The whole world is drowning and we don 't have the gills for it . What ? - I didn 't say anything . - You gave me that look . - What look ? - The " I feel sorry for you " look . - No , I didn 't . - Yeah , you did . No . I gave you the " I feel embanassed for you " look . Big difference . 50 that 's worse . Listen , I know I 'm no dandy fop PhD Smith type . What 's Smith got m do with your raging alcoholism ? I 'm not a raging alcoho ... You 're some character , you know that ? A real character . - I 'm a social drinker . - Mm-hm , I 'm sure you are . ( Paddy ) Now , look , the tide 's coming in , so another hour , and this place will be underwater . Brendy McGuire drowned in there , so be careful now . Wait here . You can be sure of that . ( 0'Shea ) Wow . ( Whistling tune ) Are we missing some fishermen ? What ? Oh , my God ! ( Squelching ) - Hello ! - Jesus , my heart ! - What are you doing ? - Just checking . Well , do you know of a better way ? Hmm ? Hello ! What are you expecting , " Hello , it 's only me " ? ( splashing ) - Run ! - Move ! Move ! Quickly ! - Lisa , hurry , hlHTY - - I 'm trying . - Would you move your arse ! - Get your hands off my arse . Go ! Come on , get " P ! - You OK ? - Look at the size of it . It 's OK . It can 't get through that gap . Oh , Jesus ! Leg it ! OK , go , go ! Paddy , run ! Run , man ! Come on ! ' ( Phone ringing ' ( Regan ) ) - Please hold . - ( O ' 5hea ) No , Regan , wait , no . We 've got an emergency , a real one , a huge one . ( Regan ) Did you run out of whiskey , 0'Shea ? ( Nolan ) Give me that phone . We need the ERU now . ( Regan ) Look , love , there 's a smnn coming . Now , whatever it is , it 's gonna have m wait until the morning , all right ? ( Smith ) Oh , good , you 're back . Listen , I have a theory . Those whales were killed as a food source for their spawn . The eggs are buried at the beach . - Yes , exactly . - ( Nolan ) Yeah , we know . - ( Smith ) Oh . - Well done . - What are you doing ? - Everywhere this has been , the other one 's followed . ( Stammering ) You found another one ? - Where ? - It tried to eat us . And it 's huge ! And it 's looking for her . Are ... Are you mad ? Don 't do that . - Smith , it 's for the best . - No , no , no , no . If he lights that in here , he 'll ... ( Fire alarm ringing ) Get it wet . - You really are Irish . - ( 0'Shea ) Shit ! Can you shut it off ? I 'll , er , see youse later , lads . - Right ... - 0'Shea ... - No , it 's that one here . - No , it 's not . No , it 's not that one . That 's just going to ... That 's the wrong pipe . Is it dead ? I think it 's just resting its little ... No ! ( Nolan ) 0'Shea ! Oh , my God ! It 's trying to fuck me face ! ( Yelling and screaming ) ( Nolan ) Stand up ! ( 0'Shea , muffled ) Get off ! ( All yelling ) ( Creature retches ) Vicious little fuck . - ( Grunting ) - ( Creature squealing ) Oh . There goes the scientific discovery of our time . Imagine all that we could have learnt . - ( Creature squealing faintly ) - Oh . It 's still moving . We 're gonna need to get help from the mainland . Oh , they 'll never get across the water . But if those eggs hatch with no whales to eat ... Yes , they will head inland to feed . Finishing each other 's sentences now ? - What ? - Nothing . ( Paddy ) I would have helped , but I 've a bad back . Gives me shocking pain , you know yourself . - How are you still alive ? - Diet and exercise . Took three of us to get that thing off of me . I was always lucky . Yeah , it mustn 't have liked your blood much . What have you been eating ? I had a bit of a banana , a bag of chips yesterday and ... You were drunk . ( Creature squawks ) They 're like leeches , right ? They feed off the blood . Well , when one of them bit Paddy , it almost died . Why , though ? Because Paddy was so intoxicated , his blood alcohol level was toxic . Exactly . If we taint our blood with booze , we 're poisonous to eat . Er. yeah , in theory . Who told me to cut back ? Tomorrow we 'll be sorted , we 'll get off the island , they 'll nuke the beaches or whatever they do . All we have to worry about is tonight . It 's simple . We have a lock-in . We shay out of the rain and we drink . ( Thunder rumbles ) - What ? - Listen , it 's a hostile migratory ... - What ? - Listen , it 's a hostile migratory ... - Grabbers . - For God 's sake . - Are you for real ? - Show him . That ? - You should have killed that with a hammer . - No , no , no , no . That 's just the tip - of the bloodsucking iceberg . - Grabbers ? OK , I give up . Yes , it 's a grabber . Well done . But if it 's allergic m alcohol , couldn 't we just hose it down with vodka or some shit ? How d 'you know ? Give it a go . Alcohol is a poison , yes , but it needs to be ingested to have an effect . Could we not just spray some whiskey in his mouth ? Feck that . Waste of whiskey . If you wanna get that close to it , good luck . ( Footsteps ) - What 's going on here , then ? - Just discussing something . - Looks like you 're plotting something . - No , no , no , no , no . Erm , it 's more like , erm , planning , yeah . Oh , can " ; m . Great . It 's her birthday next week . Now she thinks this is something for her . ( 0'Shea ) The only people that know about this are us . It 's gotta stay that way or we 'll have a panic on our hands . 50 how drunk are we talking here ? - Paddy levels of drunkenness . - ( Laughing ) You 've gone off your game , boy . No of fence , but I don 't think my body can handle Paddy levels . Takes years of practice . And with everyone hammered , time 's no one in a fit state - to call the shots . - I 'll keep order . I won 't be drinking . You ? We 'll both do it . Well , that ... that ... that would put you both at risk . I suggest it 's just O 'Shea . Thanks . Only one of us need risk it . And I know these people , this island , better than you . - Should be me . - ( Whispers ) Come on . I see what you 're doing here , but , enn , have you forgotten you 're a dependent alcoholic organising a piss-up in a brewery ? I 'll do it . It 'll be easier . Lisa , I 'm good to no one when I drink . I know that . So do you . I can do this . - OK . - Yeah . But just so you know , I don 't drink . I 've never even been drunk . I don 't know if I can . Course you can . And you 'll be the best drunken guard this country 's ever seen . - You 'll probably get promoted . - ( Chuckling ) Stop . Right , 0K , well , if we 're going to do this , we 'll need a blood test from a healthy subject . Lisa , you are the fittest person here . Oh , you channer . It 's true , though . Brian , I want a table of everything Paddy had last night . - What night was last night ? - Saturday . - Oh , you 've gotta be joking me . - ( Sighing ) Coming up . ( Nolan gulping ) Mmm ... Mm ! ( Slurring ) He never liked me as much as her . She was always the talented one . Daddy 's little girl . ( Laughing ) Bitch ! But ... I do have you guys , and I love you all . Even you . She 's Iangered . For the size of her , she 's able to take it . - There , that 's the lot . - ( Burps ) Hmm . It 's extraordinary . - Well done , you . - ( Laughing ) - Thank you . - I also had a snifter of ... - What 's that ? - It 's a home brew . - You bring potcheen into my bar ? - A bird never ﬂew on one wing . - When this is over , we need to talk . - ( Paddy ) Ah , come off it . This could save all our lives yet . - I 'll take that . - ( Paddy ) Careful . You will in me shit . Paddy ! - Careful . - ( Men ) Ooh ! - ( O ' 5hea ) Up you get . - Nice and easy . Guys . Jim , let 's get ready to do the blood test . You 're OK . 50 , if you 're right , this 'll kill it . Bottoms up . OK . _ . - ( Algsgffififi ! ( Sucking ) ( Gurgling ) ( Gleeson ) It must be a teetotaller . ( Smith ) Bingo . OK . ( Blowing ) That 's good . - Point two ! - Holy Christ . You unnatural eejit . You 're what 'll kill us . Point two ? You 're looking at 10 pints each , depending on height and weight . We 'll have to do shots . Property tear the arse out of it . 50 let 's do it . The Mass has ended . Go in peace to love and serve the Lord . - Amen . - ( Congregation ) Thanks be to God . Father , would you mind if I say a few words ? Hi , folks . How are you ? - Go mad . - Thanks . Erm ...

Tell your friends , tell your families . - Everybody 's welcome . - You 're throwing a party ? - Yeah . - Why ? Who needs a reason to have a laugh ? ( Chuckling ) It 's a welcome party for me . Welcome party ? But you 're leaving in a fortnight . - It 's a goodbye party . Whatever . - You only just got here . - What 's her problem ? - Enn ... What we mean to say is that ... Hey , bucko , where are you going ? This party 's for your benefit . - And all you are gonna be there , too . - Shh ! Come on . It 's the law . And I swear to God , I 'll arrest anyone here who isn 't . - You , sit down . - What ... What Garda Nolan means is that we 'd love your company . There 's no point going home to a cold , empty house , when there 'll be music and company and the craic ! - And a free bar . - A free bar ? - Oh , you 're on , boy . - That 's the spirit . Now come on , it 's a party , and the drinks are on us . ( Congregation chattering excitedly ) ( Thunder rumbling ) ( People chattering ) ( Laughing ) ( Laughing ) How are you , Bridget ?

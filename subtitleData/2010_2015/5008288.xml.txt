But not us . Some of us weren 't affected . I don 't know why . Like that man with the gun , and that woman . I call them Hunters . You might 've noticed that 's what they do . They seemed normal to begin with , but then they realised they could do what they wanted , and they started taking stuff , nicking cars cos they could , doing what they like . And not just with things - with people . It got worse and worse . And now they 've got an audience . So this ... this thing on the TV , the ... The signal . That 's what 's doing it ? That 's what 's making them act like this ? I guess they were always like that underneath . Just needed the rules to change , for no-one to intervene . What are we going to do ?

So , I guess you 're wondering why you 're here . ( WHIRRING ) Well , it 's time to tell you who you are . ( GASPS ) You 've looked better . - Do you recognise him ? - Uh ... Yeah . Your fiancé , lain Rannoch . Or , should I say , was your fiancé . In case you haven 't guessed , the pair of you aren 't very popular . But I 'll tell you what you are , though . - ( GASPS ) - You 're famous . The trial of Victoria Skillane finally concluded today , the verdict - guilty . Together with her fiancé lain Rannoch , whose death in custody had delayed the trial , Skillane abducted six-year-old Jemima Sykes just miles from her home , prompting a nationwide search amidst emotional pleas from her parents . For months , the youngster 's disappearance had been a mystery , the sole clue being her distinctive white teddy bear , discovered in a lay-by two miles from the family home . The white bear became an enduring symbol in the hunt for Jemima , a hunt that ended in a local forest . Jemima 's body was found here . It had been wrapped in a sleeping bag and burnt . The couple were caught after harrowing footage of Jemima 's torture and murder was discovered on a mobile phone in Skillane 's possession . Lain Rannoch , identified by his distinctive tattoo , killed the youngster as Victoria Skillane held the camera . Breaking down in tears , Skillane admitted to filming Jemima 's final moments , claiming her fiancé had pressured her into helping him , maintaining she was under his spell . The jury was not convinced by Skillane 's story , and neither was the judge , who labelled her " a uniquely wicked and poisonous individual " . " You were an enthusiastic spectator to Jemima 's suffering . " You actively revelled in her anguish , " he said , adding her punishment would be proportionate and considered . By hanging himself in his cell , many believe lain Rannoch evaded justice . The public mood is now focused on ensuring his accomplice can 't do the same . Patrick Lacey , UKN . ( SOBS ) I 'm sorr ... ( WAILS ) Please ... Oh , don 't start crying . Crocodile tears are making me sick ! - ( SCREAMS ) - ( AUDIENCE JEERS ) ( SOBS ) WOMAN : Murderer ! MAN : Murderer !

Take as many photographs as you want , take as many photographs as you can , but , most importantly , what I need from you is to shout and scream and let that bitch know that yous are out here . ( CHEERING ) Let 's get this show on the road ! ( CHEERING ) Murdering bitch ! Evil witch ! Dirty whore ! Burn the bitch ! ( CHEERING AND JEERING ) Murderer ! Burn in hell !

All of our roles are very , very important , yours included . Now , yours come with some basic rules . Rule number one - no talking . Not just to her , but each other as well , OK , unless it 's essential . We 're trying to get her to believe that yous are all mesmerised . ( ALL LAUGH ) I know , I know , I know . But she 's believed it up to now . Morning . Ticket , please . Thank you . JEM : OK , rule number two - keep your distance . I can 't stress the importance of this one enough , OK ? Don 't forget , she 's a dangerous individual . Imagine that she 's an escaped lion . Now , yesterday , she threw a projectile , and we will step in if she gets too close . We 're all equipped with Tasers , but then we 're into story shutdown and we 've all wasted a day . So it 's best to keep your distance , at least three metres back . You can use your camera zoom . BAXTER : Last , but not least - enjoy yourself . That 's probably the most important rule of all , OK ? Take lots of photographs , run around through the woods , but try and stay safe . We 'll be keeping an eye on you , making sure you 're all OK . So get out there , enjoy yourselves and let 's make this show happen , people ! Come on ! ( CHATTER ) ( GASPS ) Ow !

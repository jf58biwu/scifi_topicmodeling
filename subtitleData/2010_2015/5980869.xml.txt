 KIERA : Previously on Continuum ... You removed the CMR . You just trying to cover up what you did ? Because the Alec Sadler I know ... The Alec that you met two years ago is dead . Or locked away somewhere . I knew it ! Curtis is the one that killed me ! You want to cheat death , Kellog ? Help me , and I 'll teach you how . Was that Matthew Kellog ? Yes . I have this vague memory that he 's a big deal . Bigger than Alec Sadler ? Who 's Alec Sadler ? My name is Brad Tonkin . And I know why I came back . ( SOBBING ) It 's like a fog lifted . WOMAN : Peace of mind . It comes from knowing that your people are watching out for you . Like your family doctor , your therapist , your personal trainer , your nutritionist , your physiotherapist , your entire health and well-being team . But who can afford all that specialized care ? You can . Meet HALO , your health and lifestyle oracle . Real-time medical monitoring and disease prevention now within reach . This is what peace of mind looks like . ( KEYBOARD CLICKS ) I 'm worried it 's overkill . It 's perfect . We 've received pre-orders beyond our best projections . When this hits ... I win . ( SIGHS ) Ripped By mstoll KIERA : Do I know you ? BRAD : I was hoping . Who am I ? KIERA : I don 't know why I trust you . For some reason I do . CURTIS : She wasn 't supposed to be there . We should have had more time . BRAD : Your people don 't have a handle on this . Kiera ? I have nothing for breakfast . We ate the last eggs yesterday . I 'm gonna pop downstairs , ten minutes . I swear . Food . Food is coming . Kiera , it ... ( EXHALES ) BRAD : What about the mission brief ? ... fire , burn all timers , neutralize ... ( EXHALING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( ELECTRONIC BEEPING ) I know you 're in here . Aha ! Yeah . Come on . Come to Poppa . ( MANIACAL LAUGHTER ) One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . No . No ! I 'm not going back in the box ! I 'm not going , never ! No ! I am not going back in the box ! I got you . I got you this time ! ( PANTING ) Oh , no , not you . It wasn 't supposed to be you . Oh , no , no ! I 'm home ! Brad ? ( GUN COCKING ) I told you , he 's not here . Then where is he ? Is he okay ? WARREN : He 's fine . Who were you hoping was here ? You know damn well . Your house guest is your business . Katherine believes he should be here , but ... Yes , where is Katherine ? Since Chen , she 's grown cautious . Katherine is counting on you to do the right thing . She wants you to come to the choice yourself . She said to give you space . You 're with us now . I 'm not with anyone . We don 't have him , Kiera . We don 't have any idea who he is , but he 's temporally unsound . There were signs of a struggle at my place . You said he beat Chen in hand-to-hand combat . Something happened . Out there on his own , or captured by someone else , either way the stakes are huge . He 's a danger to this timeline , you realize that ? I have an idea . ( CELL PHONE BEEPING ) I 'll be in touch . Carlos , what is it ? It had to be done . You were sloppy . She wasn 't supposed to be there , we should have had more time . You people don 't have a handle on this . That 's impossible . Must be a glitch . You said you had eyes on Alec Sadler ? I 'm looking at him right now ! BRAD : Are you certain ? Because you said you had the contamination tracked . We do . Kiera Cameron inside ... Your intel is shit . We 'll regroup . I 'll reassess . You 've done enough . I 'll find you when I know more . ( TIRES SCREECHING ) CARLOS : The freelancers . I saw them , and then poof ... Somebody else . Just like that . Oh , oh , I know . Touchy subject , I know . Shh ... ( LAUGHS ) Don 't ask , don 't tell . Don 't ask , don 't tell . This guy 's free falling . I know what you 're thinking . ( IMITATING INFOMERCIAL ) Side effects may include blah , blah , blah , blah . Ask your doctor . Ask your dad . Don 't ask your dad , he 's too young . He 's way too young . It 's not going to work . Jason , you know me . Calm down . It 's okay , just ... CARLOS : Check this out . That 's the second device . The one my ... The one Alec used to travel here . Where is it ? Evidence lock-up . I need to get it out of there . No , no , no , no . Dangerous in the wrong hands . That 's temporal plutonium . Then why were you trying to put it back in play ? It needs a fix , quick fix . He needs a win , needs a win . So close , yet so far . Are you talking about Alec ? No , no . ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) Shh ! CARLOS : Yeah ? He 's free to go . CARLOS : What 're you talking about ? The charge was dropped . Lack of evidence . Klimner recanted his story , said it wasn 't him . I 'm going to need that back . It stays here . I 'm good for it , I swear . ( LAUGHS ) Not this time . Scram . I 'm sorry . Come on . Let 's go . Ding , ding . Top floor , top floor , top floor . Technology . Devices , let 's go . ( HUMMING ) A criminal assault complaint does not just go away . Not without help , it doesn 't . KIERA : Unbelievable . He was storming , and now he 's ... Calm . CARLOS : Like an addict getting a fix . Yeah . Find out how those charges were dropped . Where are you going ? To the source . You tread lightly , okay ? Piron is all over this department , and Alec Sadler is a big wheel now . He 's not your boy . Not anymore . Let me see the discharge papers on that last one . ( SIGHS ) Dillon . He do this himself ? Hey , how are Sydney and the boys ? They good ? Yeah . How about ice cream with that social worker , huh ? Red head , glasses . What was her name ? Carlos . Not the first case like that bounced . Violent outbursts the last couple weeks . All the charges dropped ? All wearing those bracelets . ( SIGHS ) Okay . Keep this between us , huh ? You didn 't hear anything from me . ( SIGHS ) Okay . ( TAPPING KEYBOARD ) You can 't just walk in here . All evidence to the contrary . You made it pretty clear last time we spoke that we were done . Jason attacked someone . Beat him pretty badly . I believe it had something to do with HALO . Can we get Jason up here , please ? He dug up a time travel device . Now , I doubt that 's an idea that he had on his own , but I can guess who might have put him up to it . A certain CMR thief . I need that chip to make the neural link work effectively with HALO . It was the missing piece of the puzzle . Should I have let it get vaporized ? Don 't try to rationalize what you did . I 'm sorry I want to make the world a better place and change this dark future that I 'm supposed to create . I think you 're lying . If I was lying , you 'd know by now . So am I ? Kiera , um ... I have to apologize . I had some sort of regression . I am truly embarrassed by what happened . Jason , I believe HALO is making you ... I haven 't felt this clear in years . You see , I took it off . HALO , it 's not causing my regression . It 's actually preventing it from being worse . HALO is safe , Kiera . I wouldn 't be wearing it if it wasn 't . Yeah , I 've made some mistakes , but you can see I 'm committed to the greater good . I still remember my own warning . You better . I 'll see you out . I 'll see myself out . ( SIGHS ) ( CLEARS THROAT ) Mr. Litchfield ? Yes . I 'm Detective Fonnegra , VPD . I 've got a couple of questions about your involvement in the HALO project . I understand you 're part of a limited developer beta test ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . ( SCOFFS ) How about the domestic charge last week ? You know about that ? I didn 't talk to anyone . They took the damn thing away , I got nothing to do with it anymore . What is it with you people ? Did somebody at the department lean on you ? Were you reimbursed ? Not nearly enough . You cops gotta get your stories straight . Go talk to that bald bastard . You mean Dillon ? Yeah . ( SIGHS ) ( BEEPS ) CARLOS : Hey , it 's me . What 'd you find ? There 's at least three others . I spoke to two of them . There were pay-offs . Dillon 's involved . How 'd it go with the boy genius ? Alec claims he doesn 't know a thing about any problems with HALO , or Jason 's extracurricular trip to the park . ( SCOFFS ) And you believe him ? I scanned him . He checked out . So that 's a dead end . It 's not sitting right . Just because Alec believes HALO is harmless , doesn 't mean that it is . Whatever they 're paying you , I 'll triple it . BRAD : I need your help . You 're Kiera 's , uh ... You 're Matthew Kellog . My reputation precedes me . I hope that 's a good thing . I know you better than you realize . I 'm not exactly from around here . You and me both . That 's why I came to you . I need resources . I need information . I don 't even know you . You will . What do you need , exactly ? I need to find a freelancer , retrieve something they took . Can you help me with that ? Those guys tend to find you . And it doesn 't usually go too well . They don 't worry me . All right , say I do find them . How would I contact you ? We pre-arrange a meeting . Take this . I 'll call you . We need to act fast , sir . Our future depends on it . Hang on . I don 't want to be rude here , but who the hell are you ? You 'll have to wait for another time . We 're seeing a reaction in less than six percent of our beta testers . Six percent . So that means if the launch goes the way we want , by Christmas we 'll have 30,000 psychotic people walking around ? It seems a bit high . It 'll never get to that It looks like a problem with the neural interfacing . It 's like , um , if someone had a gluten allergy , but , you know , in the brain . We could find a work-around . Are you dumbing this down for me or her ? No , I would never . Really . It 's an alpha model . The first quantal phones shipped as bricks . They recovered . You should have told me about this , Jason . You should have come clean . I know . How are you ? I 'm fine . Look , I don 't want you to keep wearing this if it 's hurting you . But we really need to fix it and you 're the lead on that interface . Yeah , I can , um , take breaks . A few hours on , a few hours off . ( STAMMERING ) It 'll be fine . Yeah . No more secrets between us , okay ? All right . Piron has a dangerously flawed product that they 've invested millions in , and they have Dillon on the inside sweeping up the damage . You better be 100 % sure before you make any accusations . I have three people that say he headed off charges , and payoffs were handled by Piron lawyers . Any of them willing to go on record ? No . You shoot the king , you gotta kill the king . Alec is involved . What is with your hate-on for Alec ? I thought you chose this Alec over the other one . That ceremony , for the other Kiera , did you ever stop and ask yourself why he did it ? It was about respect , closure . Or maybe a great way to cover something up . Make evidence disappear forever . Evidence of what ? Her CMR chip , he removed it . He didn 't . Yes . This HALO technology is three generations ahead of what 's available today . How do you think that happens ? Oh , that little ... Okay . Where are you going ? ( SIGHS ) I 'm going about this a different way . How so ? I 'm calling in a favor . You ? I 've got another lead to chase down . It 's along shot , but ... CARLOS : So you gave up and joined the enemy . JULIAN : Well , my principles are unchanged . I don 't work for Piron , I just watch over them . CARLOS : Really ? Huh . 'Cause from the outside , it seems like Alec bought you and put you on a leash . You 're trying to provoke me . Why ? ( SIGHS ) I 've got three crimes , all of them swept under the rug , all of them wearing HALO beta test devices . That 's not a coincidence . I 'll talk to Alec about it . Kiera already did that . I was looking for something a little more covert . Piron is putting profit ahead of public safety . I thought that 's what you were there to prevent . I 'll look into it . YOUNG BRAD : Who are you ? I just came to get something I left here . That 's my hiding spot . Yeah , I figured we could share it . That was underneath ? Uh-huh . So , uh ... Did you live here before ? You could say that . Billy Kemp do that ? Let me tell you something . Billy Kemp is a coward . You remember that the next time you see him . And then you ball up your fist , and you let him have it . Hit him ? It 's gonna hurt your hand , but he won 't come at you again . That is terrible advice . Don 't worry , I 'm with the police . You in trouble ? BRAD : Nah . But we do have some bad guys to catch , though . BRAD 'S MOTHER : Bradley Tonkin , you get in here before your lunch gets cold ! I should go . Brad , don 't be the one who hits first , okay ? That makes you the bully . But if he comes at you ... Then it 's okay ? You have to protect yourself . That was interesting . I thought you 'd been snatched . The broken glass , the blood ? Uh , yeah . Sorry . How 'd you find me ? I didn 't find you . I found him . I 'm impressed . I 'm good at my job . And sorry ? What 's going on ? Am I going to have to apologize again if I say it 's not you , even though it 's not exactly true ? I came here to help you . And you 've done that , all the way down the line . And it was a mistake and I have to go . There is something that you aren 't telling me . There 's a lot . When are you from ? And who sent you back ? We both walk away . That 's the only choice . Oh , it 's no choice at all . Put your weapon down , Travis . You think I came here alone ? ( GUN COCKING ) You must be sweet on this one , Protector . It wasn 't even hard to sneak up on you . So . You caught me . What now ? It 's like Wile E. Coyote finally catching the Road Runner . It 's a cartoon . It 's pretty existential fare , actually . There 's a coyote who 's just relentless ... We 're savoring the moment , Protector . What do you want with me ? What makes you think we 're interested in you at all ? SONYA : Where did you get these ? KIERA : From Alec . They 're experimental . They 're his . They are . INGRAM : The microcircuits are advanced beyond anything now , but it 's a weird , hybridized nano-tech . Like a caveman building a cell phone . SONYA : From the future ? Yes . Don 't . Who sent you ? There 's aspects to this time that I truly appreciate . Like how you still have to do certain things by hand . ( GRUNTING ) ( WHIMPERING ) ( GRUNTING ) You can take a hit . Apparently . Time for some answers , future man . ( GRUNTS ) What are you doing here ? Cleaning up your mess . HALO beta test , list participants . COMPUTER : HALO participants . All right , narrow to those who have reported anti-social behavior . COMPUTER : No findings . Not a one , all right ? Widen the search to former participants . COMPUTER : You do not have clearance . No access . So much for openness , Alec . Jason , you okay ? Police knock you around a little bit ? Nah , it 's all cleared up . Let 's , uh , move along , move along . Nothing to see . But you 're not the only one , are you ? Others were arrested , did things , they paid to make it go away , right ? Oh , I don 't know . You 're not wearing your HALO . No , it 's not wearing me . I 'm not wearing it . Who 's driving , now ? Right ? Right . You see some results you didn 't like , or ... Oh , no , no , no . I won 't do that . I won 't do that . Oh , no . I will not betray him . No , no , sir . Nope . Jason . Jason , there 's no one to betray here , okay ? We 're just talking about the bracelet . And Alec would never do anything to hurt people , so ... That 's right , Alec would never do something to hurt people ! Never . No , Alec Sadler will become a great man . Wouldn 't hurt anybody . You , murderer , you ... Nothing good for you . You don 't know any more about my future than I do , Jason . What ? Yes , I do . I lived , saw it . Lived it , didn 't like it . Didn 't like the ending . Didn 't like any of it . Not much , not at all . Alec , he sent us back 65 years on . Me , Kiera , Liber8 , we 're all here because of him . You , you 're not gonna stand in the way . Not now , not then , not in the future then . Jason , listen to me , okay ? You 're not well . Fine . Truth , Theseus . Murderer . You . HALO was made to make disease go away . You need to go away right now . ( ELECTRONIC BEEPING ) You 're here for a reason . Explain . ( BRAD GRUNTS ) Travis ! What is your mission ? For all we know you 're just a guy who came across some future tech . Not in this case . ( NAIL GUN FIRING ) This is on you . Start talking . ( NAILGUN FIRING ) ( SCREAMING ) ALEC : Jason ! Come on , Jason ! Jason , let him go ! Come on . ( MACHINE BEEPING ) No , no , no , Jason ! It 's okay , it 's okay . Let go ! ALEC : It 's okay , it 's okay . It 's okay . Let go , let go . It 's okay . Julian , you okay ? Jacqueline , go to my office . He does not leave this building . Yes . You okay ? Yeah . No , no , no ! No , no , no ! Jason ! You 're okay . No , no , it 's all right . It 's okay , come back . Come back . You 're okay . ( WAILING IN PAIN ) Let her go . Talk , and I will . 2039 is the year I left . I was sent because right here , right now , is when the timeline became disrupted . How would you know that ? Freelancers were ... JASMINE : Freelancers ? You 're one of those assholes ? No , we neutralized one of their facilities . We went through their reports , what wasn 't destroyed . They were convinced that this city , this time , was ground-zero for a cataclysmic time anomaly . Cataclysmic how ? I don 't know , but it rippled into my time . Nah , he was probably sent here by the Corporate Congress . Corporate what ? Corporate government . You must know it . BRAD : Corporations , multi-nationals , whatever you want to call them , they all collapsed . That explains the toy gun . Protector , news to you ? Bad news . Just let her go . No , I want to hear this . What happened ? Global economy cratered . Never recovered . Government tried to nationalize industries , that didn 't work . Companies started to cannibalize each other . They took up arms , they formed factions , declared war against the government . And ? And ? And the people had enough . A few more corporations declared war , everything changed . Revolution . Civil war . That means we did it , we changed it . Kagame 's vision ! Yeah . We made it real ! You know , the other beta testers , the ones that got arrested , they all suffered similar mental breaks to the one I had . What happened to them ? It wasn 't my choice how that got handled . But it 's done . We should move on , make the best of it . This technology , it took you decades to invent . A lifetime of expertise and experience . It 's really the zenith of your creativity . Maybe the 20-year-old you isn 't quite capable of grasping the entirety of it . I 'll do better . Everyone keeps looking at me like I 'm some naive kid , handed a legacy by my father . Sad thing is , is I never even knew the man . Never will know . I guess I was just trying to prove myself to him . That I deserved his praise and his love . But I pushed you . I thought maybe by working together I could be a better father than ... Everything you said . Was it true ? Yes . You got your memory back . And then you bolted . I didn 't like what I remembered . Yeah , well , next time leave a note . Then maybe we wouldn 't be in a situation like this . I remembered my mission . I remembered what I was supposed to do . What I did . Oh , God damn it . Kiera . Kiera ! Kiera ? I 'm the one who killed you . No . Curtis Chen killed the other me . I saw him . You saw him shoot . Your suit stopped the bullet , neutralized it somehow . I didn 't miss . I 'm sorry . What do your weapons do ? One of those is a weapon , the others are ... They 're not useful in this situation . What 's your read ? I think they 're trying to figure out if you 're full of shit . I didn 't tell them everything . That seems to be your thing . Do we believe him ? I believe her . The way she reacted ? ( SCOFFS ) Kiera ? ( GRUNTS ) It 's all wrong . There was no biological component to it . The Corporate Congress doesn 't exist . Of course the weapons are different . His story is too convenient . He 's leaving something out . We won , Travis . Take it in . KIERA : Oh , God . Oh , God . Oh , God . You ready ? Not yet . ( GRUNTS ) ( MOANING IN PAIN ) JASMINE : Shit ! ( YELLING ) Nice try , Cameron . Back ! All of you ! This feels familiar . Kill me if you want , Kiera , but it won 't change a thing . Liber8 wins and you lose . Trust me , changing the future isn 't as easy as you think . Yeah , but we did it . So make up your mind . Either pull that trigger , or let me go . KIERA : Maybe the Corporate Congress loses in this timeline , but in the timeline I come from , I killed your ass good . In your dreams , little girl . Maybe dreams are more real than you think . When did you get to be so philosophical ? When I saw my own dead body . Oh , I wish I could show you yours . ( GUNSHOTS ) He dies , you die . ( CONTINUES SHOOTING ) ALEC : And this is the heart of HALO . A bio-organic microcircuit that interfaces directly between brain and machine . There 's no other technology like it . JULIAN : Looks like it comes out of a Terminator . Jason volunteered to be one of the first beta testers . There were risks . He 's psychotic , Alec . That 's more than a risk . What happened was a glitch . He 's better now . This new chip is pure . It 's perfect . With this we 'll be able to catch cancer and other diseases . Save lives . Millions of lives eventually . I couldn 't access any of your records . Why do you want to stop HALO in its tracks ? With all the good it can do , what good would you be doing ? ( PHONE BEEPING ) Yes , I helped get those charges dropped . Why ? The benefits of this HALO thing , do they really outweigh the risks ? Everyone who wears it sends biometric and psychoanalytical data back to the Piron servers . We can collate and filter that data for warning signs of aberrant behavior . Big Brother . Wow . This just gets better and better . And if we can prevent a terrorist from striking , or a gunman from walking into a daycare ? There will be checks and balances . Believe me , I want this clone right . You and I are cut from the same cloth , Carlos . We want to protect and serve . This gives us a huge advantage . Don 't burn it all down now . No matches here . ( DOOR OPENS ) ( DOOR CLOSES ) TRAVIS : So we 're supposed to believe that you are not you ? And I 'm not the only one . There are two Alec Sadlers . Bullshit . KIERA : He made the time device work . He traveled back to change things and created another timeline . This one . Did he encounter himself ? She 'd say anything . Remember when I sprung you from the freelancers ? How I knew the story of the time you fell behind in patrol ? That 's because you and I had that conversation just before you died . Two Alec Sadlers . Think about it . That 's what created the alternate future that this guy comes from . I guess your secret deal with Sadler just got a little complicated , Garza . INGRAM : You work for Sadler ? No , of course not ! He sent her back here from 2077 . If only you people knew what you don 't know . Hey . Homeowner reported two strangers in the back yard talking to her kid . Yeah , and ? A unit responded , spoke to the witnesses , identified these two . Agent Cameron 's car was in the alleyway . There 's no sign of her . Shit . All right , text me the address . Come on , come on . Kiera , where are you ? Call me back . We 're in this together , Lucas . You can 't believe what shes saying . I can 't believe what any of you say ! And none of you can believe me ! Even though I 've got the evidence ! You are going to want to be careful with that . Lucas . Don 't you see ? If this timeline has been altered , then we 're just pawns in someone else 's game . Either Sadler 's , or hers . Lucas , no . No . He 's right . And none of you get it . Everything you 've done is for nothing . ( GROANS ) Take it easy ! It 's useless ! All of it ! Two Alecs ! Two protectors ! One dead ! And him ! ( EXPLODING ) Now you tell me something . Whose future is this ? You . Start talking . About what ? About the future we made and what happens after . Corporations versus governments . How do you think that turns out ? People chose sides , then switched sides . Tried to protect their families , only got caught up in the middle . Life became about survival , and survival became a life sentence . Please , they 're just trying to play us . Keep talking . I grew up in this beautiful city . In less than 30 years , it 's a lifeless crater . Dogs tearing at corpses , everything gone to hell . Because of you . All of you . Your useless rhetoric , your vision . None of us is in control here . You never catch the Road Runner . It can 't be done . KIERA : From the moment Alec and I traveled to this timeline , you have all been pawns in someone else 's game . CURTIS : It gets better ! Chen . It can 't be . It is . KELLOG : Aw ! Well , look at this . We got the band back together again . Sorry we 're late to the party . Your cell phone . You used it to track me . KELLOG : Well , at least he 's smart . That 's something . So come on , catch me up . I want to hear all about this alternate future you 're apparently from . Starting with , um ... Me . There 's no Corporate Congress . We won . That 's not what the man described . I remember how it feels , thinking you 're leading change , then realizing someones playing a deeper game than you can even imagine . Like you , Lazarus ? It 's not a game . It 's a mission . The one he sent me back for . Kellog is one of several clan leaders , created this plan to change history . SONYA : Kellog ? INGRAM : You see ? Any future is possible . You just have to want it bad enough . CURTIS : I 'm living proof . Travis , you were done before you began , brother . Kellog , working for himself . Curtis , working for the freelancers . And Garza , working for Alec Sadler . Your plans were compromised from the beginning . No one controls the future . It is an ever-evolving organism free to change and adapt as it sees fit . BRAD : Nothing left to fight for . No winners . There is no perfect system . I can show you if you let me . Lei him open your eyes . Show us . As we stand now , on the precipice of war , I am reminded of what we have endured ... ls that me ? ... and what we are fighting for . Hundreds of thousands have already paid a terrible price , with their lives . But for what ? Our children are starving . Our city is in ruins . We have had enough . We must rise up as one . We must act now , before it 's too late . Before our strength and our will abandons us . You can 't know what impact your moves will have now . You 're done . You 're all done . She 's right . It 's pointless . And I 'm tired of being someone else 's bitch . SONYA : This is just one possible future . We 're needed now more than ever . No , our mission concept is flawed . A soldier knows when the battle is lost . Think I can have that ? Does it matter ? Tools always backfire . Brad , you ready to finish this ? I 'm not the same guy that came through , Curtis . You 're both on your own now . CURTIS : I 'll tell you what I do know . Whatever is supposed to happen will , with or without you . We 'll pick this up later . We can fix this . We can still fight for what we believe in . I don 't know what that is anymore . Ripped By mstoll

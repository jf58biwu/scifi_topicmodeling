Um , how about you get to have sex ... With yourself ? Awesome deal . I 'm sorry . He 's a bastard . Who ? Paul . Beth loved him but he wouldn 't love her back , and he wouldn 't leave her .

If there 's anything pertinent I should know , anything at ah ' ... PAUL ' . If there were , I would tell you . Oh , shit ! It 's him . No , don 't answer that . No ! - Hello . - Beth ... - Where are you ? - Out . Where are you ? We have to talk . - About what ? - I need you to come home . Yeah , I don 't think so . He knows something . Well , you can 't go back there . You know that . No , I can 't . Oh , shit . - Oh , my God ! - Paul followed me straight to Kira . Is this a bad time ? You tased me , you maced me . And you think I 'm just gonna ... I 'm just gonna walk away , like I 'm nobody ? - I was working a job . - Uh-huh . Oh . Yeah ? Yeah , you would have ruined the whole thing . Yeah ? I guess you 're on a roll now , huh , Sarah ? And that coke that you stole from me ? Pretending to be dead . Who do you think took the fall for that ? Huh ? Pouchy took my finger . If I don 't come up with 15K ... He 's gonna lobster me . A finger every week until all I have left is a lobster claw . Sit down , sit down . Do you want the money or not ? There 's 20K . Fifteen for your debt and then five for your pain and suffering . It must have been some play . Uh-uh . This is piss-off money , okay ? You don 't get to know anything . I 'm entitled to know everything . Can I ask you a question ? How do you do it ? Lying there in that morgue ? Holding your breath , Sarah , while I am bawling ? I 'm crying like a goddamn child . You know what 's crazy ? You know how stupid I am ? I 'm standing here looking at you and all I keep thinking about is Myrtle Beach . - You remember ? - Out . Yeah , that was a long time ago , Vic . I was working with that mook Angel , he got you in with the carnies . I 'm not proud of what we did . We were on top of the world , Sarah . We were parasites . No . We were in love . Not me . Ever . I think , she means it , Victor . You want that money ? Take it and go now . Right now , Vic ! Okay . It 's not over , Sarah . Is every man in your life a complete wanker , except me ? I need you to go to S 's house . Make sure Kira 's okay . Yeah ? You 're not going back to Paul 's . I will not let him threaten my daughter . Sarah , you 're not going back to Paul 's . Sarah ! No , it 's fine . Don 't worry . If anything else comes up , I 'll let you know . - Felix called yet ? - Yeah . He just played me the recording . I heard everything . Um , where are you ? I 'm about to go in , and shoot Paul in the balls . Wait , Sarah . This is our chance to get answers . He followed me to Kira , Cos . I know , I know . But he also covered for you . Right ? That Olivier guy , he asked if anything was wrong and Paul said no . Why ? Because , I think he might be falling for fake Beth . Yes ! That 's awesome . That ... You can use that . Who do you think got me into this mess in the first place ? Huh ? Okay . I know . Just chill . I think that Olivier guy , he runs Paul . It sounds like some kind of double-blind . What are you going on about ? They are keeping Paul in the dark too . Right ? So that he can 't skew the results either . You mean , he may not even know he 's watching a clone ? Yes , right . But Olivier definitely knows . Okay , he 's the one that we need to get to . You mind if I get through Paul first ? Sarah ? I 'll sleep on the couch . Donnie , Donnie . You 're right . Everyone deserves their privacy . Come . I thought you handed in your sidearm . Huh ? Left jacket pocket , hanging low . Well , apparently , I 've got a stalker . Sit . Put it on the table . I knew . I couldn 't put my finger on it , but I knew . It was that day you were supposed to do the hearing , first time we had sex in months . What ? I missed you . You were wearing that Clash t-shirt . I was like , " What ? " And then , wham , you screw me , right on the kitchen counter . You complaining , Paul ? What are you saying ? You quit the force . After refusing ever even to think it . You know what I 've been through . And then the scar on your neck just disappears . Because of what ? Some cream ? And now ... This little girl . I was there when Beth found out she couldn 't have kids . So , who is this girl ? She 's my half-sister . I watched you together . She 's your daughter , isn 't she ? You 're losing it . Am n I was looking at some old video today . You were training for that half-marathon . What was the last race you ran ? What city was it in ? Where is Beth ? One last time , whoever you are , where is Beth ? She killed herself . She jumped in front of a train . You 're English . Who are you ? I 'm her twin . Twin ? Is this a test ? A test of what ? Beth didn 't have a sister . What 's your name ? Sarah . Sarah what ? Sarah 's good enough . When Beth died , I took her identity . Beth isn 't dead . Look , I was just gonna clean out her bank accounts . I didn 't mean to get all tangled up with you . If she really is dead , how do I know you didn 't kill her ? - ' Cause you killed her . - What ? You 're her monitor , aren 't you ? And what 's that ? You observe her . You let people into her home . Like last night . Doctors came and medically examined her in her sleep . And she knew . You 're a plant and she killed herself because the man that she loved turned her whole life into a lie . She knew you didn 't love her and she couldn 't understand why you wouldn 't leave . And now she figured it out . This isn 't true . It is a sick test , isn 't it ? Isn 't it ? She trusted you . How could you do that to her ? You think I had a choice . Just tell me why ? They don 't tell us why . Where did you go in the middle of the night , Donnie ? I don 't know , Never Never Land . What 's the emergency ? - Hi . - We 're not late for the potluck ? I may have a monitor dilemma of my own . It 's really nice to make a friend in the brave new world . That is a really good look on you .

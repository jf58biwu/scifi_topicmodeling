Shit ! - Finn . - Go to Jasper . - I just wanted to ... - Go to Jasper ! - Finn , I am sorry . - Who is this ? This is my bookie . Ivan . That man you always spoke on the phone . What is he doing in our house ? - I have no idea . - Is it normal ? Have you ever seen him ? In our apartment before . No , is not fucking normal . - Did you tell him about the camera ? - I do not . - You planned this . - No , never . - What is he doing in our apartment ? - I said I do not know . Good . Is he dangerous ? Well , He accept bets from suspicious types like me . So , yes . He is dangerous . I do not see Marcus with his goons . If I was in trouble . He would be in the picture . Alternatively . He sits here out of sight in the picture . I woke up early and I heard him to be moving around the room . Came on after an hour time and did not say a word . I do not know what those red pills , but he took two already . Can you shut up for a second ? Yes Hey , Ivan . Jasper said . I know . How are you ? What ? Everything is okay now . Why would not it be ? There is no reason . well , what you want to bet Today ? Ivan . No , no betting . Today I am going to rest . Thank you . Why did you call me ? Oh ! Shit . I have to go , Ivan . I will talk to you later . So , what does that mean ? Therefore , we will wait 8 hours . In addition , see what happens . Honey , can we talk ? Hey , Ivan . What a surprise . I was thinking why have appeared tonight and then it occurred to me . Most likely because I termed as paranoid fucking idiot . Hey , Ivan . What a surprise . What are you doing ? He will be here soon . You cannot leave me alone . I am not in the picture , so ... You send me a message when is it doing ? Well , I. I am not in the picture too , so ... Maybe I should go too . - Where are you going ? - I do not know . Can I come with you ? You are amazing . - Fire is true friends . - We have to do what is in the photo . Where are we going ? Nowhere . I do not want to leave Jasper alone if something goes wrong . Are we all right with us ? I was jealous . This is it . It is a very complicated situation . You do your best . I am obviously not . I cannot stand this well . Were you jealous ? Tell me more . Then , Ivan . I mean what a surprise . You already said that . Oh , yeah ? Do you want a drink ? You know what I like about you , Jasper . You never owed . I have never had to send Marcus to collect the money . I can appreciate that . I can . Is it yours ? Can I see it ? Come on let me look at . It is good . Yes . Return me back . Believe it or not , sometimes I used to do Marcus ' work . I was bad with liar 's debts . I had my style , you know . I used batons for heating . Gave me extra strength . Once . Oh ! My God . I should fix person knees . The standard thing you know . I have done hundreds of times . Only this time . I swung and hit him . Moreover , rod broke . Piece of rod fly directly into his stomach . You should hear it . He screamed like a cat . I swear , as I listened to him Nurse drains . Said they had one testicle swollen like a grapefruit . Imagine the pain . Messy . Unfortunate messy job . In my position I am . There is only one thing worse than guy who is able to cover his betting . This is a guy who never does not lose the bet . Suppose I finally got lucky . Just lucky ? You just guess . - Listen , I did not set ! Okay . - Is this an algorithm ? No , I swear I did not . This is only the winning series . Okay , well , I have a source ! I have a source . He is reliable . I cannot explain it . It can cause serious problems . Does the fruit was a doctor ? - Tell me how you win ! - I do not . It is nothing like that . Look , you would not have believed me if I tell you . Oh ! Bullshit ! Can you not just rewrite my bets ? - You Just to bet the same as me . - I know what you mean cheating . You are an asshole . I hope you enjoy the show , Jasper . I will take it . - Finn , this is ... - I was just leaving . So , are we good ? So . - Basically means he knows . - He knows shit . He knows that you have a type of information . How long will be happy with downloading your bets . I do not know . Forever ? I have everything over control . You look awful , Jasper . - Did you sleep ? - Do you know what ? Get off my dick . You and Callie get all these money without doing anything . - You should be happy . - We are all in this together . Callie and I share the risk . I just hope that you have a backup plan if this with your bookie fails . It seems you wear something else on tonight 's picture . Fuck you , Jasper . I am not going to start while he is here . Jasper will now to walk , right ? - will you not ? - So I will . Yes . Do you not forget to come to spying on me in 8p.m. I do not know what I am doing here . You will have to fill me in . Course . Just stand in the same posture as shown in figure and I ... I will do the rest . Yes . I would really like to know how take me into this . You and I are both . What are you thinking ? You only really are ... You are very beautiful . You do not sound so surprised . Oh ! No , no . I suppose to be moment like this ... to wake up you and see what is in front of you ? It is our character . It is amazing . It is blurry and not focuses . I can still recognize her silhouette . The whole day I was asking to myself . How is that possible ? So . Marcus will be your nanny . And you . Will you take me to show what is there ? I would not have believed if you had told me . Ejects them every day and night . What about living the day . I do not know . Since we discovered there are pictures only at night . What is this ? This is the new photo . Okay . Okay . This is the deal . Every day you will take a picture . With the statistics that appear tomorrow and necklace at the window . Marcus will come to pick up that image for security . - Wait a second . - I will not repeat it myself ! The three of you going to sit on couch and I know you to behave well . I do not tell anyone about this . We do not want someone messing around our golden goose here . Do not you ? I want 50 % profit . You remove zero from this number . It still makes you a very lucky man . Yes . I feel very lucky man . We not agreed to this . - You should talk to us first . - I gave my best , all right ! I will still get some money . I will make lots bets yet . We will be fine . What will happen when his superiors reveal . How long will it be more horrible figures appear here . Ivan is smart . He will not fuck this . Oh ! It is very convincing . Unbelievable ! Where is the photo of yesterday ? Wait ! You will not probably paint something like this . Yes . What else can I do ? We do not have control over what happens . He will keep the pictures . For security reasons . No , this is very unacceptable . You will call him ! Now . Tell him we will post results at the window , we retain the image . Are you a fucking child ? You realize who is on the other side of the phone . All right ? Honey , I will make some tea . Do you want something ? You know . You have always painted . You only see what you are already painted . I Know ! I am aware Callie . That is what pisses me off . I painted them in the future now when I see a photo . In addition , I not paint them . Jasper you can . What is it ? Can you sneak into the room take a picture of next photo with the phone ? Today you will not see the photo , tomorrow there will be photo to take . Will be if you agree to take a photo . Look , man . If you make decisions will continue to dictate my future . Can you take a picture on my favour . Please ? I risk my neck just because you cannot find inspiration ! Fuck that . - Can you not be happy with the money ? - I do not . No ! I cannot , Jasper . I do not care about the money . At this point would rather called the police . Or took a bucket of water and poured on your precious machine . Is this a fucking threat ? No ! It is not , but you cannot ignore the fact that . Some of us are not good passed in this agreement . I will see what I can do . There is a painting . Thank God . You say to thank Jasper . What is it now ? It is somewhat weird . It is not Really , something I usually painted . Looks like you painted it in a hurry . Do you see how the color drips ? - Maybe it is a warning . - What ? Perhaps it will be something bad that happens . You just send us a warning . Look . I look scared . All right ? I am staring at that picture . I am trying to tell myself something . I do not look happy , but ... This situation is not exactly ideal . No . I have told you , Finn . This is not something you would paint . Yes , but the art is weird . I just . I am glad painted something . Just relax , Jasper . " The art of posing naked . " What if . Is Jasper all right ? What if tomorrow will be something terrible happen ? They would not be in the photo . All right ? We went . Okay ! Why do not we go now ? - You want to go . - Let us pack up and just go away . What ? You just want to ... Leave Jasper come up With this in the end by himself . He would not mind . He would be fine . He is with the machine over there . I mean ... We cannot just leave while there is still hope that will solve everything . I see no reason to do it . Okay . I trust on you . And , you have to admit the machine works like magic on you . What can I say ? I like how you paint the nude . Hi . Hey , Joe . Do you not work in the night 's shift ? In fact , yesterday was my last shift . I came back to return the keys . Your Last shift ? Yeah , man . I am moving to the big city . Congratulations . This is great . It is wonderful ! Is everything okay ? Yeah . Oh ! Let me give you my card . Let us have a drink sometime . Yes . - Stay in touch . Okay ? - And you are in touch too . What is wrong ? - Marcus got me talking with Big Joe . - What the fuck happened ? Nothing happened . Big Joe gave me a business card . - What did Marcus do ? - He called someone and drove off . Fucking shit ! Wait . Did not we just say that it was nothing . No , because he would not believe us . Okay . It is all right because I planned this . I hid weapons throughout the house . Wait , for what is it ? Just because you paint the fucking skull . All right ? You have to paint before than get a photo of camera . Paint a fucking picture ! Okay ! Sorry . - Did you hide the gun in the house ? - Yes , I hide weapons in the house . Why did you hide the weapons ? - Do you know who these people are ? - What exactly did you hide ? - Just sit quietly and relax . - No , I am very worried . Just sit back and relax ! - What happens after the photo was taking ? - We will wait . We will just sit and wait . They will come in . Ask some questions . If all goes well . It will be all right . What if is it there not all right ? Finn . There is a Hammer under the couch . He was only security guard from the building . What these business card belongs to a cop . Well , He became one . He was returning the keys . It was his last shift . I did not say anything about you and the machine . So . I would like to believe it . Unfortunately . I cannot ... Afford to trust you . What does he search ? Maybe I can help . Is she your girlfriend ? Yes ? Yes . Maybe she can help . Okay . Let me see if you can remember something new . I am watching you . Boyfriend . Adrenalin . Race . Believe me . You are not so fast enough . There is an easier way to resolve this issue . - Which is to answer my questions . - Please do not ! You will die . Why do I not feel so concern ? Because you have not seen future 's picture yet . It shows your murder . Moreover , who is going to kill me ? You ? He will do . Maybe for the money . He must have already got because of the richness of the bet . Keys . You just change this chair . I am serious . As soon , he sees the photo . He will come through that window And , shoot you in your back . Smart move . Where is Jasper ? Marcus , where is Jasper ? Where is he ? Jasper , stop fucking ! Hello ? Hello , Mrs. Anderson . No , Callie burned her hand on the stove . Yes , everything is fine . Thank you . Goodbye . Okay . Oh ! My God . - Okay . - Good . - We cannot leave here forever . - Do not tell me . Oh ! Shit ! It is only temporary . - What is next ? - Next ? I go to get my money at Ivan . Thank you for cleaned the living room . Do you mean the blood ? Thank for I cleaned the blood . Which could it be mine ? You are welcome . - Honey . - Do not ! - I want to make sure you are okay . - Do I look all right ? - What can I do ? - Why do not you go to paint ? My God ! Is it not great ? This is just the beginning . Jasper . I think you should go . Split the money . Leave the country . Go away . Just stay away from this machine . Are you fucking crazy ? Safest place on earth is right here . We see at these photos of tomorrow every day . We know that we will be alive tomorrow . - Callie and I ... We are . - Are we what ? You know what I ... All I know is that Jasper saved my life tonight . I am going to bed . Jasper , can you give me something to sleep ? Thank you . Callie ? Callie ? Callie ? Hi , I am Dr. Heidecker . I am sorry to bother you at this time . - How can I help you ? - Henry Bezzerides . My colleagues . Does he live in the apartment across the street ? Yes , he lives . I knocked , but nobody answered . What is going on ? Dr. Heidecker search to Ms. Bezzerides . You told her that he moved a few months ago . Did he give you his hat ? Before he went . We found his diary and from what I have read . - He saw something bad . - I know . - He tried to change . - I know , he sent me a letter . After he retired informed me about his experiments . To be honest I did not claimed a lot of hope in him . Poor Henry . Yes . Do not mess with time . Do you think it is time did this ? He somehow punished as tried to change the future . What else could have done this ? Florium gas would be my first guess . Do you see that reel over there ? I assume that he is trying to get with one shelf and then broken down . And he fell over the container with chemical . His death was only accident and nothing more . I doubt . That he was in panic . While he was in the process of ... Avoid this . You see the hat on the couch , what look like his blood on the window . It is seem to think that to the present day . Obvious this photo will happen tomorrow . It had nothing to do with him . It is ironic . Tomorrow ? How could he shoot when the camera captures only one day in advance ? Why ? I do not know where you got those data , I think you are wrong . This letter sent to me a week ago . Therefore , he had to record this photo at least as much in advance . Wait . How he could record ? Would you say that it could capture at any time ? No , I do not know anything when it can take . Obviously , Henry completed initial tests . He continued investigating . and went away . Do you think he could change the future ? Henry shared with me results , not his methods . I know about the controls as you , know . It is too bad . This woman did not want to hurt us . What about the gun is in her hand . I do not think she would use it . Do not you know it ? Okay ! If I had not reacted Callie now would cry over our dead bodies . At least would bring up the police . It seems that Jasper just trying to protect us . You were not there . Are you ready for your big moment ? Hell , yes ! Do you want that me to go there see if everything is all right ? Yes . How does tomorrow look like ? Hey , Callie . Is it photo 's tomorrow ? Well , I do not want to see it . Can we pack up our bags and leave ? You are not going anywhere . Have you not heard of Dr. Heidecker ? She said that it was an accident . Which means that things can change ? I think I will take a chance . Please , come on ! Come on ! You commit suicide . However , do not kill your girlfriend on way . What is it ? Are you in the photo ? - Let me see it . - I do not . I have already ripped date . How is she ? She falls asleep . She was shaking . I gave her something . To calm her down . Yes . It was so good to us while it was well . We had such a good relationship . - Sorry , man . - Not you , it is me . It is my fault . - Oh , yeah ? - Yes . I bought it for her a year ago . I did not have the courage . Why is it so ? You were right I was in panic . Coward . I mean . I am not a painter . I am a janitor . And , she deserves more than that . I want to be more than that . I realized . Not . I mean . I do not blame you . I thought about all this . Who knows , maybe I make decisions in secret . I know , I just ... I Was with fear sabotaged everything . Maybe there is a way to fix it all . - I think it is too late . - Yes ? Do you know ? I start to like this smell . How fucked up is that ? When I saw the suitcase . I knew you would leave the set . I do not care what the Dr. Heidecker said . You do not mess with time . I need you alive , at least another day . If I have to put you in that couch . Help me God . I put you in there . It is here . It will keep you warm tonight . Help ! Help ! Let me out . someone ! Okay . I got it . Damn you ! Jasper . I painted it today . However , he saw two weeks ago . Do I have sent down here ? Why would I do this ? Thank you . Who is the fuck ? You son of a bitch ! Do not you dare ! I will kill you on the spot ! Do you understand ? If you do that ... the bucket will fall . Go to Callie and give her The phone . stop pushing me . Take . Callie , do you see me ? Hello ? Last night I passed out and locked in a storage room by Jasper . What ? He will kill you . No , he would never . Give me the phone . If you do not put those bucket down . I spread her brains all over the fucking window ! Anyway , you are going to kill us . you will kill me if I hang a bucket or not . There is only one way out of this . We leave . If we go , you can keep the machine . Hurry ! This shit is getting heavy . Give Callie the phone . Callie ? I want you to look into pocket of Jasper sweatshirt . there is something of yours . something that I bought a long time ago . I am sorry ! - I am sorry . I was not there for you . - It is okay . What it is now ? You take the gun . You take it from Jasper . Give me the gun . Give me the gun ! Give it to me ! Now you stand back . Over there . Whatever you say . - I will be there in 30 seconds . - Okay . Wait . Damn ! I came back . You know what ? Maybe that is heat you at night . - Where are you going ? - Far away from here . We will need some of this . - Take as much as you want . - You can always earn more . Do you not forget the ring . My God , I really killed him . You had no choice . Come on ! Sit down . Are you okay ? - I will get some ice . - Okay , but we need to go . My God ! See . The picture is changed . Thank God . I saw you two together in the photo 's tomorrow . Now everything is fine . I thought do not make any changes as Dr. Heidecker told us . Shit ! I have to paint it . I do not understand . I painted this for Mr. Be , so ... I can use his keys to get out of storage . It does not matter . I will tell you when we go . - We have to go before the police . - Well , I will get more ice . This is ... Impossible . I am sure to paint this already . We have not changed anything . And , where did this come from ? - I thought you went to get ice . - I did . I went .. What are you talking ? It does not matter . Here , you would most likely need to lie down . Put some ice on your head . What the fuck is that ? The camera just took a picture . What is this ? " Kill Jasper to save Finn " " Exchange with picture no painted . " I can explain . Do not . Wait , wait , and wait . Talk to me , tell me . What is going on ? - Let us sit down ... - No , then speak ! Okay . Do you remember when we received a call . Mr. Be is late with the rent . And , I went to check on him . Mr. Be. are you at home ? I found the machine and from sticking photos . " Drop the hanger " . " Hide living pictures last week " . The reason why there are night and day photos on the wall of Mr. Be . Is because the camera captures images in 8a.m and 8p.m. I was hiding it from you and Jasper . I could send secret messages to myself . You are up early . So , when I now caught you in the kitchen ... What did you do ? I kept it . Last night , while I was posing Jasper with the money . I replaced the photo . Now I just changed back again . I have seen all photos of night . And , Jasper is dead , so ... When was this photo take ? It is previously . When before ? Before ! Before ! A month ago , when you drunk to play charades . Look . It meant nothing . I just pretended . I would drink sometimes . Look . It was almost as if I want to caught so that you wake up . It is an excuse . I am sorry . I was so weak . I just cannot believe you ... Allow this . You have had more than one opportunity to warn us of this . Why did not you do ? I just did what told me photos to do . I managed to work for a while . Do not you see ? It is all happening for a reason . Watch . Everything we had is fading . You have been so far , but then ... You were jealous first time in a long time . Finally , I was able to feel your kiss again . You said you needed moment like this ... To wake up and see what is in front of you . Gradually we get closer and closer again . Then ... " Do not forgive Finn . " You have continued to make choices machine and the work before us . Therefore , I had to do something make you understand . " Kill Jasper to save Finn . " " Exchange with picture no painted . " Then today ... You fought for us . Stronger than I have ever seen you to fight for something . So in the end ... Everything worked . Everything settled . What are you doing ? I should have done from the start . I will break the machine . Please , stop ! Please , stop ! You said we change things . Right ? Then I just have to put a new note at the window for tonight 's photo . Then , when I get a message at tonight 's image . I will know how to stop them to catch me now at the window . You will never find the photos . We will never have this conversation . If you destroy the machine , I cannot correct this . I wish you had not made me on it . It will be fine . Tomorrow we will not remember anything of this . It will be fine . " Do not be caught at window " What are you doing here , Joe ? I got a message from Finn . He told me that you two going out of town . I might be interested if Jasper will go away too . What is the window ? Can I come in ? Sure . Fine . It does not matter . Tonight none of this matter . I guess you would have some questions for me . " Do not be caught at window "

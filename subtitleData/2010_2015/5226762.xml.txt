 Julia : Chester 's mill is a place like any other . At least it used to be Until we were cut off from the rest of the world By a mysterious dome . ( cows bellowing ) Invisible , indestructible , And completely inescapable . We 're trapped . Julia : We don 't know where it came from or why it 's here , But now trapped under the dome together , None of our secrets are safe . It 's the pink stars . Joe : And they 're making constellations . What does it mean ? Julia : Peter got in over his head And forced you to kill him to defend yourself . I found this life insurance policy today . This would be void Hello , max . For the past eight days , I 've been watching you . Anything bad happens to me , Your secrets still come out . Agatha : That 's my daughter maxine . Now , do me a favor and drop that gun . ( yells ) agatha ! Please . Junior : It 's amazing . It 's still just a barn , galileo . Angie : Great , so we painted dots over those lights from the egg . What does it mean ? Maybe the dome 's trying to communicate . It stopped the riots with the rain . Made us babble about pink stars . I wonder what it 's trying to tell us now . I don 't know . But these four stars aren 't Part of any constellation . I think they 're us . Junior : What 's this guy Have to do with it ? Hey , it changed color overnight . From green to clear . You can see wings now . It 's a monarch . It 's gonna hatch into a butterfly . It 's pretty rad . It 's not rad ... It 's insane ! We 're , like , the guardians Of some secret cosmic mystery . ( norrie sighs ) It 's too much , it 's too much . We 've got to tell somebody . The dome 's been pretty clear About not wanting anyone else to know about it . When dodee snuck in here , She got zapped and wound up in the hospital . We could tell julia . When she touched this thing , She said my ghost told her that the monarch will be crowned . Maybe she 's not one of us , But she might have some answers . Junior : He 's right . That thing 's gonna hatch , And when it does , Maybe it will ... Lead us to something . Or someone . Like the monarch 's a person . Like a king maybe . Who might be able to bring the dome down . All right . So the dome trusts julia . Joe , go tell her . I just want to make sure that we 're on the same page . So , you , duke perkins and reverend coggins conspired To acquire a vast amount of propane ? Yeah , we bought propane off the books . But only to keep this town afloat . By selling it to maxine seagrave ? A drug dealer ? But you kept some of it in your warehouse . And you can thank the lord that we did . Because right now in the middle of this ... Nightmare , the lights are on . Because your generator is running Using my propane . The diner 's open because of my propane . We 're setting up irrigation for crops , bartering systems . Hell , chester 's mill might just stay alive Because of my propane . You think I 'm a crook ? ( laughs ) I think I 'm owed a damn parade . You know , it doesn 't change The fact that if this dome hadn 't come down , You 'd be in jail . I 'd say it saved your ass , big jim . So , go ahead . Charge me with conspiracy to keep the lights on . Or You can go after a real criminal . And who might that be ? Someone who 's a real mystery In this town . A man who just got here . Who 's only out for himself . And isn 't shy about ... Letting people know it . How was the couch ? Lonely . So was the bed . Do you want me to leave ? I want you to take me to peter 's grave . For us to move forward , I need closure . I think you do , too . So ... Yeah , I need to see peter 's grave . I 'll go get dressed . Linda : You want me to go after barbie ? What did he ever do ? Barbie wasn 't just passing through chester 's mill . He was here , working for max seagrave . He was ? That 's her gambling enforcer . He was here putting the screws To people in this town- - our town . No , this sounds ... Crazy ? Till it 's true . Here 's a name you haven 't heard in a while . Peter shumway . He was up to his eyeballs in debt to max . Barbie was with him the day the dome came down . And guess what ? Haven 't heard a peep from old peter since . You know , some people have secrets you ... You couldn 't imagine . What about you ? I 'm an open book . ( doorbell rings ) I got it . Can I help you ? Right now , you can 't even help yourself . Julia ! Hold on . Linda , are you there ? Linda ( over radio ) : I 'm here , barbie . Julia 's been shot ! What ? She answered the door And somebody shot her . Who ? I don 't know ! If you can believe him . Linda , listen , I can 't drive And keep her from bleeding out at the same time . I need someone to give me a ride right now . I 'll be right there , barbie . Linda ... Think . Think . You hungry ? Yeah . Well , our chickens are still laying eggs . I can scramble some up . Can you believe it , angie ? Uh , no , it 's ... All been pretty crazy . I mean us . I ... I , uh ... I never thought fate was real . That there was this ... Plan . But now it 's undeniable . What are you talking about ? The way our lives are braided together . And they will be forever . What ? Are you insane ? ! You kept me prisoner , okay ? I almost died down there ! But you didn 't . We 're both alive and we 're here right now . It is the four of us who are connected . It is not about you and me . It will never be about you ... I don 't believe you . Well , believe it ! We will never be together ! And if somehow we make this dome come down , Then I am gone , too . And you will never see me again . Then I 'm out . What ? I 'm done with you , with this , The mini-dome , all of it . You can 't just walk out . We need your ... My hand ? I know ... My hand on the little dome So we can make pink stars and do Whatever the hell else it wants to do . This might be our only shot . ( chuckles ) and you 're gonna ruin that out of spite ? ( wind blowing ) I 've never met someone so selfish ! It 's love , angie . I 'd rather live in here And die in here than be apart from you . ( door slams ) ( wind howling ) ( engine sputtering ) Damn it ! Great . Now even the cops are getting ripped off . I need a ride ! No gas . ( groans ) Stop your vehicle ! ( tires screech ) What , are you carjacking me ? Phil , I need a ride to julia 's . She just got shot . Get in . ( wind howling ) Joe ! Barbie ? Hey , get in here right now ! Oh , my god . Uh , yeah . I have my learner 's permit , But the guy said I didn 't check my mirrors . Just help-help me get her in the car . Now come on . Sit her up . Let 's go . Sit her up . Get the door ! Get the door ! ( grunts ) Are we good ? Yeah , we 're good . Go ! ( tires squealing ) ( tires squeal ) What the hell ? Hell 's down here . You want a ride ? You just happen to be in the neighborhood ? It 'll be nice to get a little bit of rain . You and I need to talk . Somebody shot julia shumway . It 's a perilous world we live in . I know it was you . Well , barbie said the one word a girl hates to hear : " no . " Where is this going , max ? That 's up to you , jimmy . Life 's all about making the right choices . You make the right one , you play nice , And it 's good between us . You step out of line like barbie did ... ? Lucky for me I 'm single . Oh , I 'm sure there 's someone around here you care about . Junior : Dad . Go on to work , junior . Well , look who I finally get to meet . Junior , hi . Hi . I 'm a friend of your dad 's . Hi . Wow , you are , you 're a rennie , all right . Those eyes , it 's , like ... It 's like I 'm looking Right at your mom . I bet you face a lot of danger And I bet your dad is just constantly worried about you , huh ? All right , that 's enough , max . I have some business to attend to on bird island . The weather 's acting up . I 'm not sure it 's a great time to be on the water . Aren 't you sweet to think about me ? Your dad , he is so thoughtful , to the end . I 'll be at the factory later on If you need me . Ciao . Who was that ? The devil . ( horn blaring ) Julia ! Jul , hey , hey , hey , stay with me . Hey , you got to hurry , joe . She 's crashing ! I 'm working on it . ( tires squeal ) You 're doing great , joe . Just get us there . It 's pretty bad up there . Yeah , it 's pretty bad back here , too , joe . I mean , it 's not just the weather . It 's the dome . I think it 's angry at us . ( tires squeal ) I got julia . You pop the trunk , plug this thing in . We need the juice . Okay . ( wind whistling ) Barbie ! All right , let 's get her inside ! Put her in the second room . Yeah , right there . So , it 's a through and through ? Then there 's no bullet to remove ? Sounds like she 's taking in air through the wound , So we 've got to relieve this pressure , Or else it 's gonna crush her heart and lungs . Please , somebody , a tree fell on our garage ! My husband was inside ! He 's not breathing ! ( julia wheezing ) Go get me a piece of plastic tubing So we can relieve the pressure in her chest here . This place is picked clean . I 'll make do with a pen , plastic bag . Grab some alcohol . Pen , plastic bag , the alcohol . How do you know how to do all this ? I had to chest tube my team sergeant in fallujah . What happened to him ? ( wind whooshing ) I thought everybody had to turn in their guns . I 'm not everybody . Dad , what 's going on ? That woman max ... She 's gonna take everything I worked for ... And destroy it . What do you mean ? Son , I 've been doing my damndest To get things back to normal , Make the trains run on time . Max is trying to fill those trains With drugs and liquor and every kind of sick vice Human beings can get into . She seems nice enough to me . Well , that just Shows you don 't know what the hell you 're talking about . ( wind whistling ) She 's angry , junior ... At me . And she wants to hurt me ... By hurting you . Then let me help you . I can handle this . Dad , I can help . Junior , no . I 'm a man . No , I can do something ! Junior . Junior , no ! Single dad Raising a kid . ( inhales deeply ) I did the best I could . But you still punish me for it . I know I have , But not anymore . Look , son , with someone like max I don 't know how this ends . Dad , don 't say that . It 's the truth . ( wind whistling ) You stay in the house . Do not open the door for anybody but me . Do you hear me ? ( thunder crashes ) ( thunder crashes ) Lightning . I wonder if that changes anything . Okay . Man ( garbled ) : Imagery transmission . Uhf data adapter . Satcom . You 're kidding me . It 's working again . All right , come on , baby . ( static ) Speak clearly . Affirm . Man 2 : It 's barbie . We 've confirmed it . Barbie ? Man 1 : Yes , sir . We reviewed the tape from visitors ' day . There 's no question- - that 's dale barbara in there . Man 2 : Roger that . He 's the one we 've been looking for . ( wind whistling ) ( frantic knocking on door ) ( knocking continues ) ( screams ) What the hell are you doing ? ! I could ask you the same thing . Well , don 't bother shooting me ! You 're about to get the whole town killed ! What ? Junior , look at what it 's doing ! What is that ? ( droning sound ) it 's sending a message . You have to come back to the group . It takes all of us , or we 're nothing ! It 's talking to us , junior . To you ! What , so now I control the weather ? This thing has done a lot of crazy stuff , But never this . Not until you turned your back on us . ( panting ) ( monitor beeping ) Barbie ? I 'm okay . ( flatline tone sounds ) What 's happening ? Her heart stopped . Too much pressure . ( grunts ) Uh ... ( slurping ) What are you doing ? I 'm sucking out The extra air in her chest . Junior : Come on , we gotta ride it out Down in the shelter ! No , are you nuts ? ! We have to go be with joe and norrie ! My dad said to stay here . Junior , do you want to make this right ? Then come with me . Not because I am promising you anything , But because the dome is telling you What you 're supposed to do to be with us . We need you . You need me , angie . Fine . I need you . Now come on ! Come on , we gotta go , come on ! Angie ! See ? I was right ! ( flatline tone continues ) ( wind howling ) ( monitor beeping rhythmically ) It worked . You did it . I had a little help , joe . Joe : Storm 's breaking up . I gotta go now . I have to tell them . You have to tell who ? You saved julia . Just like you saved me when the dome came down . Maybe you 're here to save all of us . I don 't think so , bud . Junior was right . The monarch 's a person . That person 's you . ( monitor beeping rhythmically ) ♪ ( sobs ) : Oh , mom . ( monitor beeping rhythmically ) Barbie : Hey , listen . I don 't want to leave her , but I gotta go Take care of something , so could you ... She and I aren 't going anywhere . Thank you . ( vehicle approaching ) Julia okay ? Barely . Still ... You know it 's max who shot her , right ? Yeah . And I also know That it 's time to stop her . It 's gonna take both of us to do it . But we 're gonna do this by my rules , jim . We 're taking max alive . Oh , great . So we 'll be high and mighty ... And dead . That 's all you know , isn 't it ? Kill or be killed ? You 're not saving chester 's mill , You 're eating this town alive . You have no idea what it takes . We do this , And then you and I ... We 're finished . I 've spent the last two weeks trying to convince myself That we want the same thing . We do . No . I want a future . I want something that I can build towards . You want a kingdom . This town needs a leader . Not your kind . Made a few mistakes . But nobody loves this town better than I do . No , you love power , jim . That 's it . Now , we take down max , and we are done . And then I am gonna do whatever I have to do To make sure that I knock you off of your throne . Norrie ? Where 's joe ? I don 't know . He went to go talk to julia and hasn 't come back . Well , he must still be there , right ? He wouldn 't try to come back in this storm . We barely made it ourselves . Yeah , that was so weird . It came out of nowhere . Yeah , maybe not . Hey , guys . Joe ! Where have you been ? Where 's julia ? She got shot . What ? Yeah , in the chest . And then she died for a minute , But she 's gonna be okay . Barbie brought her back . It was incredible . Thank god . Guys ... I think he might be the monarch . The tornado Went away right after he finished sucking the air Out of her chest , it was ... Ew . No , that 's not why the storm stopped . What ? It stopped because I decided to come back . Okay ... Look , something started it , And something stopped it . But what do we do now ? ( exhales ) we need to go to the dome . ( sighs ) The big dome . Right . If these stars are really us , Then we have to go to the same spot on the big dome . Under the north star ... Due north ... That 's right around the bollingwood bridge . And then what ? I don 't know . Stuff happened when we touched it together . Okay . So ... The four of us Need to do the exact same thing . Angie : Enough guessing . ( sighs ) The dome owes us some answers . So what 's the plan ? We March right in And let her ambush us ? We 're not going in the front door . Julia showed me another way the day the missile hit . What are you doing ? I 'm giving us a way out . It 's just an alarm clock . The hell do we need an alarm for ? ( beeps ) ( beeping rhythmically ) just in case . ( rhythmic beeping continues ) Let 's go . Phil : Julia 's car is gone . I guess barbie took her . Oh , god . I didn 't think he could ever go this far . How well do you know barbie ? I don 't think anybody knows him . Julia does . Or thought she did . Peter shumway ... He was in deep . He bet the house . Literally . The house . And lost . And barbie was the collection agent . Wasn 't too polite about it , either . Do you really think ... If barbie killed peter ... And then julia found out . Would you just shut your mouth for once ? ( gun hammer cocks ) Hello , boys . Keep walking . That 's all they were packing , boss . Jim killed my mother , barbie . I don 't suppose He told you that , did he ? You two are just the same . I don 't think so . You and me , though ... Well , that 's a different story . We were good together . No , we were never good . You paid me , I did a job , that 's it . Well , it 's a good thing you 're handsome , brother , Because you sure are thick sometimes . What do you mean ? ( voice breaks ) : I mean , I 'm giving you a chance ... To live . What , with you ? Max , you shot julia . She was never right for you , anyway . You 're the one who 's not right , max . ( voice catches ) : I had plans for you . I trusted you ... And you screwed me over . You 're no different from him ... Or from anyone else in this town . Look who 's talking . No , that is not true , jim ! I am nothing like you ! I am a survivor ! If you have plans to be somewhere , Then someone is going to be very disappointed . ( beeping rhythmically ) ( beeping rapidly ) ( clanking ) Barbie : Get down ! ( gasps ) Now we are all leaving . Let 's go . Go . Julia 's here , but barbie 's gone . They said that he took off with big jim . Could be at the cement factory . Max set up a fight club there . Heard people say they lost money on barbie yesterday . Get out . Come on . Linda , You cannot do this by yourself , man . You 're not a cop , phil . I 'll see you soon . You 're stealing my car . I 'll go get our car . I 'll take them down to the station . You don 't want to do this , I promise . I already took care of your little insurance policy . ( scoffs ) you have no idea . It 's over . What the hell did you do ? ! As long as max is breathing , She 's a threat . Now she 's not . And neither are you . ( groans ) ( gun cocks ) linda : Barbie , put that weapon down ! Put it down now ! Big jim : Linda , thank god ! He 's gone nuts ! Big jim : He killed ' em ! First he cuffed ' em , and then he shot ' em in the head ! I was next ! Back up , barbie . Put the weapon down . Put your hands behind your back . You killed your last victim . Spread your legs apart . You 're done . Linda , I 'm telling you ... ( linda gasps ) Stop , or I 'll shoot ! Shoot that son of a bitch ! ( dry firing ) Big jim : Am I set ? Two secs . Almost there . Hey , jim ? Yeah ? I heard something today . From the outside . It was about barbie . What are you talking about ? It was the military . They know he 's in here . Tell me exactly what they said . They said that he 's the one . The one that they 've been looking for . Turn it on . This is jim rennie . I 'm sorry to report That this has been a very dark day in chester 's mill . I need all citizens to be aware and vigilant .

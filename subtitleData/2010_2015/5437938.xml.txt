 [ Leaves rustling ] Did you hear that ? Aah ! Alvarez ! He will be fine in a few hours . Drop it ! [ Whip ! Whip ! Whip ! ] I was planning to . [ Whip ! ] [ Whip ! Whip ! ] [ Grunts ] [ Rumbling ] [ Evos snarling ] They are free . Muy bueno . Providence is now at war with the green fist ! ♪ so make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way ♪ ♪ we 're gonna have fun tonight ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ ♪ so make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ Rex : Come on , doc . Are you serious ? Another one ? Ouch ! [ Groans ] Is this really necessary ? Dr. Holiday : The rainforest is rife with diseases , poisonous insects , and worse . I don 't want you coming down with anything . White Knight : Is he ready to go ? Dr. Holiday : As ready as he 'll ever be . Rex : He 's wondering how come Six doesn 't have to get a shot if he 's also going . White Knight : Six is still in New Zealand , dealing with a ... - Small problem . - Rex : Oh , sure . Let him deal with the small stuff while I do all the hard work . White Knight : We don 't have time to wait for him . You 're going solo . [ Slump ! Clank ! ] Bobo : Hey ! Where he goes , I go . White Knight : Like I said , solo . Now , this green fist group have been stealing evos all over South America . We believe they will hit Corazón de Selva next . Dr. Holiday : The Providence station there has just captured a large batch of evos in the jungle . Rex : Bobo and I are ready to roll . [ Ting ! ] White Knight : Be careful . For all we know , the green fist could be selling evos to Van Kleiss . Bobo : I 'm ready for carnival ! Let 's party ! White Knight : [ Clears throat ] The situation down there is ... complex . I need both of you to handle the mission quietly and with diplomacy . Rex : I can be diplomatic . Oh , by the way , you might want to think about switching to low-fat , White . Starting to look a little ... Jowly . Bobo : Better leave the diplomacy to the smart one . Rex : This is the town ? - [ Rooster crows ] - [ Goat bleats ] Bobo : Something tells me they 're not in the mood to party . Maybe a knock-knock joke would lighten things up ? You must be Rex . Rex : You 're agent Martello ? You may call me " Oso , " my friend . Rex : White Knight said to send his regards . Maybe he could come visit sometime , get a little sun , see what it 's like in the front lines nowadays ? [ Laughing ] And this must be the monkey . He does tricks ? Hello , señor Bobo . Bobo : That 's " agent Haha " to you , buddy . Come . The station is not far . Bobo : Doesn 't anybody mow the grass around here ? [ Chuckles ] Often . But the jungle can only be kept at bay , not subdued . [ Door creaks ] [ Grunting ] There we go . Bobo : [ Grunts ] Apologies . The air-conditioning is down again . Bobo : Makes our place look like penthouse suite . But who needs air-conditioning ? We 're here to work ! The kennel is this way . [ Evos snarl ] Most of these os we brought in last week from deep in the jungle . A tempting target for the green fist . Rex : Whoa . It 's packed in here ! What are you gonna do with all of them ? The big ones are shipped to larger facilities , like yours . These smaller ones stay here . They 're really quite harmless , but the world wants evos captured , so we keep them . Oh , careful ! This evo is not like the rest . Took down six of my agents before we caught it . Rex : Is it really tiny or something ? That 's strange . He was here this morning . It can 't have escaped . [ Growls ] Aah ! Bobo : Peekaboo . [ Electricity buzzes ] [ Roars ] Aah ! Bobo : Yah ! [ Electricity zapping ] [ Snarls ] Rex : You all right there , buddy ? I think you 've both earned that cold drink you wanted . Rex : See ? This gig isn 't so bad . Cold drinks , fringe benefits . Bobo : It 's on the fringe , all right , but I don 't see the benefit . Drink , agent Haha . Horchata , the rice milk , is good for you . Besides ... It 's all they serve here . Rex : I think it 's pretty good , but how come we can 't get any service ? We 're Providence . All they know is when there 's trouble , Providence is there . Our relationship with them is , uh , complex . [ Chair scrapes ] Rex : Complex ? We protect them from evos . You know , this calls for a little diplomacy . Bobo : Oh , brother . Rex : Excuse me . ¿ Sí ? Rex : Uh ... Uh ... [ Chuckles ] You don 't look like the usual Providence soldiers . Rex : That 's ' cause I 'm not . Name 's Rex . Maybe you 've seen me on the news ? No . [ Pop ! ] Rex : Uh , what 's that ? The horchata anejo . It 's aged . Muy sabrosa . Rex : I 'll take a pitcher of that . We only make one pitcher a night . They have it . Rex : Hey , mind if I try some ? It 's too strong for you , gringo . Rex : Gringo ? Soy Mexicano . Y tambien eres Providence . Okay . Let 's see if you can handle it . Rex : Gracias . [ Grunts ] [ Warble ! Warble ! Warble ! ] [ Gulps ] Ugh ! That 's good ! Smooth ! - [ Gagging ] - [ Laughs ] Rex : I don 't get what makes it so special . It 's made from rice that 's passed through the digestive system of a monkey . [ Growls ] [ Grunts ] Rex : Whoa ! [ Thudding ] [ Gasps ] [ Grunts ] Rex : [ Grunts ] [ Clang ! ] [ Whip ! ] [ Bonk ! ] Aah ! Rex : I can 't use my evo powers against them ! I don 't want to hurt these people ! Bobo : I wish they felt the same about us ! [ Crash ! ] Rex : Oso , you know how to use one of those ? The lariat ? Oh , yes . I grew up roping steer on my uncle 's rancho . Bobo : Rex ! [ Whirl ! Whirl ! Whirl ! ] [ All gasp ] El es un evo ! [ Sighs ] [ Laughs ] Rex : So , what do you think of that ? Aah ! [ Grunts ] You are like the other Providence agents ... bad for business ! [ Laughs ] This is where diplomacy gets you , my young friend . Now , are you up for a stakeout ? Bobo : Not me . I 've had it with this hick town and these ungrateful people . I 'm going home . Rex : But , Bobo , we need you for a special undercover mission . Please , agent Haha . You are the key to the entire operation . Bobo : Oh , yeah ? Well , you could have said that before . [ Laughs ] Quiet ! I 'm trying to free you from Providence . Bobo : I am Providence , dummy . [ Grunts ] [ Evos grunting ] [ Laughs ] These toys of yours ... they 're for children ! [ Grunts ] [ Grunts ] [ Whoosh ! ] [ Whoosh ! ] [ Whir ! ] Rex : [ Grunts ] Who 're you working for ? [ Grunts ] Rex : [ Gasps ] You ? ! Horchata girl ? ! What do you think you 're doing ? ! I 'm freeing all your prisoners , creep . [ Alarm blaring ] [ Evos roaring and snarling ] [ Rumbling ] [ Growls ] Bobo : [ Groans ] Whoa ! [ Roars ] Rex : Scratch marks ? Weird . What the heck did this ? [ Woman screams ] - Aah ! - [ Growls ] Rex : Take a number ! I have business with the señorita first . [ Grunting ] Rex : Aah ! Aah ! [ Grunts ] - Bobo : Hyah ! - Aah ! - Bobo : Yeah , and stay down ! - [ Handcuffs click ] Rex , you okay ? Rex : [ Groans ] I feel ... fine . I hope Holiday gave me a shot for whatever that was . For the last time , we don 't work for Van Kleiss ! The green fist fights for the evos who cannot fight for themselves . We set them free ... nothing more . Bobo : [ Snorts ] Just what we need ... humans for ethical treatment of evos . Ugh ! We were returning them to their natural habitat . What Providence does is wrong and against the natural order of things . You 're a traitor to your own kind . Rex : That thing you set free ... its natural order is to exterminate mankind . It wanted to kill you . Your men are dying because of it . - Dr. Holiday : I wish I had better news . - Rex : Thanks anyway , doc . We 'll call with updates . Bobo : What did she say ? [ Door scrapes , clicks ] Rex : The nanites in my system are fighting off the toxin , but that 's only slowing it down . We need to make an antitoxin or ... or ... Or se va a morir ! Bobo : In English ! In English ! Rex : It 's doing to me what it 's done to Valentina 's men . If we don 't get that antitoxin soon , they 'll die , and , eventually ... I will , too . Bobo : Think I liked it better in Spanish . If I can get a blood sample off that evo with this , it 'll beam its DNA sequence back to Holiday and she 'll be able to instantly synthesize an antitoxin . Rex : I want to go . - You 're sick . - Bobo : Aah ! Rex : I 'm better equipped than any agent you have , and you know it . [ Sighs ] Very well . You 'll come with me and a team of my best men . You 're killing him if you do that . Listen , you need me , Providence man . I know that jungle better than anyone . Your big , noisy party will alert that evo . You won 't get within a mile of it . My men are dying , too . Let me free ! You think I 'm going to let you just walk out of here alone ? Rex : No . I 'm going , too . [ Flies buzzing ] Bobo : [ Grunting ] Aah ! [ Beep ] Anything yet ? Rex : Nothing . Rex , once you get the sample of the evo 's blood for the antitoxin , I 'll pick you up in the jump jet . White Knight wants you sticking to his orders , nothing more ... capture the evo and bring back the prisoner . Rex : Gotcha . Orders ? Prisoners ? You wonder why we 're suspicious of Providence . Rex : We 're protecting people . What we 're doing is good . I believe that . You think I don 't believe in what I do ? Who decides who 's right ... your White Knight ? Bobo : [ Snoring ] Rex : All we 've found out here are goats from the village ... At least what 's left of them . [ Groans ] You all right ? Rex : I 'm fine . Let 's just hope this trap works . Bobo : [ Snoring ] [ Leaves rustling ] [ Roars ] Bobo : Hey , pal , didn 't anybody tell you the trap 's over there ? Aah ! [ Snarling ] We 've caught him ! Bobo : No ! You caught me ! Big difference . [ Roars ] Rex : Aaah ! That 's it . No more running . Hyah ! Ahh ! Okay , time for more running ! [ Grunts ] [ Grunts ] Ahh ! [ Grunts ] Rex : Adiós ! Aah ! [ Groans ] The toxins are breaking down my nanites ! [ Roars ] [ Creaking ] Rex : [ Panting ] Over here ! Come and get me ! [ Snarling ] Rex : Don 't ! It 'll kill you ! You 're too ill to fight it ! Rex : Look , put down the flower basket and trust me . [ Grunts ] [ Snarls ] Rex : On my signal . Come on . Come on . Don 't you want a nice Rex burger for breakfast ? Not yet . Not yet . - Now ! - [ Whip ] [ Grunts ] You caught it . You 've saved my men . Rex : We caught it ... together . First my cure ... [ Beep ] [ Whirs ] Now his . [ Bones crack ] [ Whoosh ! ] I don 't believe it . This thing ... it isn 't an evo . The fangs , the toxin ... The goat ! Of course ! How could I have been so blind ? This animal is a chupacabra ! Rex : Chupacabra ? Isn 't that a myth , like Bigfoot or the Loch Ness monster ? I thought it was only a legend , too . Rex : Providence must have come blundering onto its home turf and captured it . So ... What will you do ? Rex : Only one option , as far as I see it . [ Ting ! ] [ Grunts ] [ Shing ! ] [ Growls ] Rex : Go on . Get ! - Get ! - [ Snarls ] There are things in this jungle stranger than evos and older than man . Rex : Well , as long as they stay here , we won 't have any more problems . [ Beep ] Doc , did the sample beam through okay ? Dr. Holiday : I 'm synthesizing the antitoxin right now . It 'll be at the base by the time Oso picks you up . Rex : He 'll be here soon with the jump jet . You better get going . Your orders were to bring me back . Rex : I don 't always follow orders . Thank you . This still doesn 't make up for spitting the horchata in my face . Bobo : Ooh , slick . If it was me , I would have kissed her . The antitoxin will have you back to normal within the hour . [ Beep ] Now , what happened with the woman ? Rex : She , uh , got away . I see . You 're learning , my friend . It 's complex . A woman like that ... it makes our problems with evos seem simple , no ? [ Laughs ] Safe journey , my friends . - I hope to see you again . - [ Crowd cheers ] Bobo : That makes one of us . Wait ! For your trip ! Rex : Uh ... Gracias . How 'd I earn this ? I heard what you did . The chupacabra ... it stole my abuela 's goat . Providence is going to buy her a new one . Thank you . [ Smooches ] Bobo : Hey , if that 's all it took to make you happy , we would have run off with the goat when we first came to town . Aah ! Aw ! Some thanks !

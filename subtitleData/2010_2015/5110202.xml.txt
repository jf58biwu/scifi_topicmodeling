The Vadhaka statue ... ? ! Wolverine ! You may not pass ! What ! ? What 's going on ? ! It 's the Vadhaka statue ... Statue ! ? It 's not some kinda robot ? Yeah . It was supposed to be locked up in Kurohagi 's base , the Dragon Palace . It used be be the guardian spirit of Madripoor . But it shouldn 't be able to move unless someone unlocked the seal ... Seems to be moving fine now ! That bastard Kurohagi must have unlocked the seal ! Probably to deal with you ! Don 't try and pin this on me ! There they are ! It 's them ! Hold it ! We shouldn 't go this way ! See ? Listen up ! Stick close to me . This is our chance ... What 's going with these psychos ! ? Happens all the time . They 're at war . On a tiny island like this ? That 's gotta get old ! There 's no escape ! Damned ox ! Get outta here ! Crush you ! Crush you ! Got you ! Let go ! Let go of me ! Hands off ! Get moving , or someone else is going to grab you . Logan ! I didn 't expect to find you wasting time like this . And to rescue a little girl ? Yukio ... Yukio ? Aren 't you after Mariko ? Go and find Shingen ! You don 't gotta remind me ! I guess he just can 't help himself ... Dammit , give it a rest. bub ! I 'm getting sick of this ! Logan ! This is quick-drying concrete , so if you don 't get out of there you 're gonna be stuck ! A giant statue and a ton of concrete ... Should make for a sturdy foundation . Yeah . Thanks for the help . Didn 't I tell you not to waste time ? I heard you ! Let 's get going , then . No way ! Wolverine ! Friggin ' pest ! Are you okay ? Are you still here ! ? Run home already , kid ! I 'm not a kid ! And I can 't go home alone ! What 're you babbling about ? Kill ! Die ! You alright ? Maybe when they 're healed , they 'll be a little more feminine ? Yukio ! So they 're finally breaking out the guns , eh ? This way ! Hey ! I 'm tired of wandering around in this hole ! Seeya . Wait ! Come with me ! Why in the world would I wanna hang out with you ? I 'm getting sick of it . Amazing ... Oh , this ? Stop ! They 're my friends . Friends ? So what the hell is going on ? Everyone on this blasted island 's been trying to kill me , but now your friends show up ? Guys , help me explain ! alright ? I ain 't got time to waste down here . Didn 't I tell you you won 't make it to the Dragon Palace on your own ! ? Not with the Vadhaka out there ! I hate people telling me what I can and can 't do ! Especially when they 're kids . I 'm not a kid ! Seeya ! Careful with those burns , alright ? To be able to catch my cane from that position , and even throw it back at me ... Although I suppose it would take far more to kill Wolverine , with his famous healing factor . You know who I am ? Everything flows from the surface down here . Information is the same . Well done , Min . You did very well . Thank you , Master Koh ! I 'm sure a little salve will take care of my hands ... To be able to get him down here was very impressive . Although I hadn 't anticipated that the Vadhaka would be unleashed ... Damn that Kurohagi ! This a joke ? I 'm even more sick of hanging around down here . I 'm taking off before I end up choking one of you . A man like you coming to this island is very beneficial to us ... I hate guys who are always scheming about something , and beyond that , you 're being a pain in my ass ! Let 's make a trade then . I assure you , it 's a good deal . A trade ! ? Destroy Wolverine ... ! Hey . I 'm looking for a man named Logan , he also goes by Wolverine . Heard of him ? Logan ? Wolverine ? Yeah ... You a friend of his ? It seems you do know ... where is he ? We 're not gonna tell you for free ! Where is Logan ? I-I-I don 't know ! I swear ! I really don 't know ! Then who would know ? How should I know ! ? You 're Koh , right ? I appreciate you telling me the shortcut to the Dragon Palace , but ... I wanna hear what I 'm supposed to offer in this trade . You 're an impatient man ... From underground , it 's easy to tell what 's happening on the streets . We have been fighting a guerilla war on the surface , waiting for a chance ... A chance to kill Kurohagi , and retake Madripoor for ourselves . So , you just wanna be sitting on the throne instead of Kurohagi ? Either way , I don 't really care . It seems Kurohagi 's wedding will be happening sooner than had been anticipated . Once the wedding begins , there 'll be more security , and guests from outside ... Madripoor will , essentially , stop being Madripoor . We were going to take advantage of that chaos , and invade the Dragon Palace . But you arriving here has changed the situation . I 'm gonna take Mariko back ! Even if our aims are different , our destination is the same . We would appreciate it if the famous Wolverine would lend us his strength . So you want me to help your fight ? This is where we 've been staging our resistance against Kurohagi . Follow me . This stuff ... We 'll get rid of Kurohagi 's son ! And take Shingen Yashida down with him ! Shingen ? If you know about Shingen , then I guess this is about more than hating Kurohagi ... When I still lived on the surface ... I was locked in conflict with Kurohagi 's father for control of this island . His name was Juo . Shingen came from Japan , looking to upset that balance . I paid no attention to him , but Juo did ... He made a deal with Shingen . In exchange for control of a portion of Madripoor , he would have me assassinated . So a killer was brought from Japan ... A female assassin , named Miyuki . Back then , my son Kai was acting as my bodyguard ... But then , in spite of being enemies , the two of them fell in love . I suppose for a man and woman who had both lived in the underworld for their entire lives , they related to each other and had a passion that couldn 't be found anywhere else ... When I was told of this , I became furious , and tried to kill them both myself ... But ... I couldn 't ... I couldn 't do it . I put all my resources to work , trying to hide the two of them . Years passed ... And once things had quieted down , I tried to help them escape Madripoor . But because I was so worried for the two of them , I must have let my guard down . And Kurohagi took advantage of that opportunity ! Run ! Master Koh ! Master Koh , please escape ! Father ... Find him ! Don 't let him escape ! After him ! I managed to survive , at the cost of this leg ... But in exchange , Madripoor fell under Kurohagi 's control . More than that , Kurohagi resented Shingen for failing to kill me , and went back on their deal to give him partial control of the island . I get it ... So that 's why Shingen was craving control of this place . I was also responsible for the child that my son and his wife gave birth to ... Child ? Master Koh ! Every channel on the island 's been hijacked ! Yukio ! Are you seeing this , Logan ? If you want to save this woman 's life , come out and surrender ! That scum-sucking sack of garbage ! Yukio ! ? Master Koh ? Yukio is ... Yukio is Kai and Miyuki 's daughter ! You dying as bait for someone bigger is perfect ! Just like your parents . The pain in my leg is crying out ! It tells me to kill Kurohagi . He will make his way here , just as you 've been wishing . It ain 't for my own sake ... it 's for the sake of someone I love ! Next time on Wolverine : Koh .

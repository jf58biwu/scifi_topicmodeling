 Previously on Fringe ... I crossed into another universe and took a son that wasn 't mine . Not a day has passed without me feeling the burden of that act . Peter deserves to know the truth about who he is . You saved his life . I am sure that he will understand . You didn 't just open up a hole to the other side . - You brought me back . - Son , this- - I am not your son . Peter checked himself out of the hospital three hours ago . He 's gone . Walter ? I 've decided that we need to get organized . You 've been smoking marijuana . I 'd hardly classify what I 've just smoked as marijuana . It 's- - it 's a hybrid . Of chronic supernova and afghani kush . I call it Brown Betty . Walter ... I know how you 're feeling . It 's important to take control of one 's life . - Walter . - Eh . Peter is going to come back . He just needs some time . But he will come back . - Oh ! - Hey . Hey . Is there news ? Have you found him ? I 'm sorry , Walter . I have some leads that I would like to follow up , but I have to- - You have to what ? What can be more important than finding Peter ? Aunt Liv ... The snack machine stole the dollar you gave me . Hi , Astrid . Hi , uncle Walter . Hi , Ella . You know what ? We have some snacks back there in the fridge . You can go help yourself . Thanks . Who 's that ? - Ella , Walter . - It smells funny in here . Rachel 's daughter . Rachel 's Olivia 's sister . Rachel had to go to Chicago for the weekend , so she asked if I could look after Ella . And I was wondering if maybe you could watch her- - Oh , no , no , no . I couldn 't possibly look after anyone else . I 'm well into phase one . I think she 's talking about me . Walter just smoked something called " Brown Betty . " - Hi , cow . - Be careful , Stella . Gene , gene , no licking . No licking . You should only have to watch her for a few hours . Don 't worry , Olivia . I will be here . We would love to have her . You 're killing him . You 're not supposed to touch the sides . What kind of doctor are you ? You 're not even trying . - His heart . - All you 've done is eat all my snacks and talk about weird stuff . And everything makes you laugh . I know ! Why don 't you tell me a story ? I 'm not very good at stories . Didn 't you used to tell stories to Peter ? I 'm sure Mrs. Bishop did , but ... No , I never told Peter stories . I was always ... too busy with my work . What about your parents , uncle Walter ? Didn 't they tell you stories ? Oh , yes . My mother loved Chandler and another writer called Dashiell Hammett . She loved detective stories . Oh ! And musicals ! She adored musicals ! She often would dress me up to play parts in plays at school . I was roughed up quite a lot as a child . Walter ... I think that Ella would really , really enjoy a story . Once upon a time . Well , all right . Are you ready ? Um , hmm . Once upon a time ... there was an accomplished detective . Except that she had decided to retire , pack it in , because there was one mystery she could not solve . What was that ? How to mend a broken heart . Miss Dunham ? My name is Rachel . I 'm sorry to just show up like this , but I have left you several messages , and I 'd like to hire you . My boyfriend , he 's gone missing . Well , as you can see , I 'm kinda busy . He got in over his head to a gambler . A guy named Big Eddie . I 'm afraid something bad may have happened to him . - Drown him ? - I 'm sorry , what ? Oh , uh , no , thank you . You know , most times when someone comes in here worried that their sweetheart 's gone missing , or worse ... By the time they find out what I usually find out , they wind up wishing he really were dead . What do you usually find out ? Rachel , is it ? Do yourself a favor . Go home . He wouldn 't do what you 're suggesting . We met only a few weeks ago , but ... It was love at first sight . You probably don 't believe something like that exists . But I assure you it does . * Something happens and I 'm head over You * * I never find out till I 'm head over heels * * something happens and I 'm head over heels * * don 't take my heart , don 't break my heart * * don 't , don 't , don 't throw it away * What those school kids must 've done to you . Maybe you should teach me algebra . Oh . Oh , you see , the ... medication that uncle Walter is on , causes his posterior and lateral cricoarytenoid muscles to contract his larnyx 's . Anyway , what was I saying ? Ah ! Yes . True love . When was the last time you spoke to him ? On the telephone two days ago . Okay , and what 's his name ? Peter Bishop . Wait a minute . That 's wrong . My mom doesn 't love Peter . Of course not . It 's just a story . But , as with all good stories , things aren 't always as they seem . So where were we ? She just took the case . Oh , yes . How could she not ? See , what Rachel didn 't know is that detective Olivia once believed in love . Especially great love . And , if for no other reason , she took this case to see if such a love really existed . Now , this is where things might get a bit frightening . I 'm not sure you 'd want me to go on . Does it have to do with Peter ? Maybe . It just might . You see , just as Olivia was gathering the facts from Rachel , far on the other side of town , a young man had gone into hiding because he had in his possession a very special item . What kind of item ? As it happens ... a heart . But a heart unlike anything the world had ever seen . Now ... the measure of a good detective is where she gets her information from . Is he here ? Detective Dunham knew some high people in low places . * And you just can 't escape from the sound * * don 't worry too much , it 'll happen to you * * we were children once playing with toys * Hello , lieutenant Broyles . Good to see you . What 's the matter ? You 're not gonna say hello ? Well , now , I didn 't know if you actually meant hello or if you were just stringing me along . You 're good at that . I need to ask a favor . Must be a good one if you 're coming to me . Not as good a favor as pretending six years ago I didn 't see a cop on the beat plant evidence to get a promotion . But yeah , it 's important . What is it ? Missing person . Never seen him . What about this ? Does it mean anything to you ? That guy 's sweetheart found it in her apartment the night he vanished . It 's a company logo . Massive Dynamic . Ever heard of them ? No . What do they do ? Question is , what don 't they do ? Indeed , what don 't they do ? Olivia did her homework and soon found out some of the things they did do . Like what ? Massive Dynamic made its money at any cost . A vile firm that never missed an opportunity to exploit the little guy . Profiteering off the creativity of others . Miss Dunham ... Nina Sharp . Pleasure to meet you . Thank you so much for seeing me . Detective Broyles called on your behalf . He said you were looking for someone ? You thought I may be able to provide some information ? Uh , yes . His name is Peter Bishop . I 'm investigating his disappearance on behalf of his fiancee . She believes he may be in trouble . Yeah , that wouldn 't surprise me . Whatever trouble he 's in , I 'm sure he deserves much worse . Peter Bishop is a con man with many talents and many identities- - All of them suspect . Small cons to large scale industrial espionage , with only one person 's interests at heart- - His own . I see . But I can tell you one thing . If he 's pretending to love this woman , he must be using her somehow . For her sake and yours , I hope he stays missing . He 's dangerous . Ah , I 'm sorry . My attention is required on another matter . Of course . Thank you so much for your time . Miss Dunham . You should proceed with caution . I meant it when I said that Peter Bishop is dangerous . It 's me . There has been a development . Hello , this is Rachel . Please leave a message . Uh , this is Olivia Dunham . I need to talk to you . It 's about Peter Bishop . So could you give me a call as soon as you get this ? - Rachel ? - Help me , miss Dunham ! Rachel ! That 's not how it goes . She can 't be dead . Why not ? Probably because it 's her mother , Walter . - Oh . - No , that 's not it . Because that 's not how stories work . She 's in love- - true love . She can 't die . But ... as I have said , in this story , things are not as they seem . She was an actress . Her real name wasn 't even Rachel , it was Kelsey . Don 't ask me what to make of it , we 're in the dark . But whoever did this was good . Didn 't leave fingerprints . Hell , we can 't even identify what type of weapon he used . But one thing we both know , Dunham- - Death seems to follow you around . What you sayin ' there , chief ? I 'm saying I want you as far away as possible . Just when my interest is piqued ? Keep nosing around , and you and your interest can spend some time downtown as a guest of the state . Well , it 's three hot meals and a bed . It 's tempting . But , uh ... I think I 'll pass . I 'm serious , Dunham . Time to leave things to the big boys . Okay , you win . Directory assistance ? Yes , operator , I would like an address , please . Go ahead , hon . What 's the name ? Uh , for dr . Walter Bishop . It 's you . Kind of . Slightly less handsome than your uncle Walter . But equally brilliant . A taker , a dreamer . And Olivia would soon discover that he was the one that got her mixed up in all this . So you 're saying that you hired her to hire me to find Peter Bishop ? That 's right . Why didn 't you come to me yourself ? Ah . Your reputation precedes you , miss Dunham . You aren 't the best , but you 're selective . You only take cases where someone has lost their heart to love . So I used her to get your attention . I never meant for her to be harmed . Okay , well , you 've got my attention now , dr . Bishop . Now who the hell is Peter Bishop , and why are you looking for him ? He was my lab assistant . You got the same name . You related ? Just coincidental , although I did grow to love Peter as a son . But apparently , he was far more dangerous than I feared . He stole something from me . My most ... important invention . I have spent my life making things that bring joy and happiness , to make the world a better place . Bubble gum was one of my first . Ah . Flannel pajamas . Oh , rainbows . And my latest project , singing corpses . Two , three , four ... * who can take a sunrise * * who can take a sunrise * * sprinkle it with dew * * sprinkle it with dew * * cover it with chocolate and a miracle or two * * the candy man * * the candy man can * * ' cause he mixes it with love * * and makes the world taste good * Why not bring a little life to the dead , I say . Their harmonies are still a bit off . What 's this ? Well , that 's a hug , of course . He invented hugs ? Oh , yes , my dear . He invented everything that is wonderful in the world . Teddy bears , and chocolate bars , and ... Oh , and something even more remarkable than that . A heart . A glass heart . What makes it so special ? Put simply , it 's a power source . But it 's capable of many wondrous things . And until quite recently ... I was kept alive his glass heart . I had a bad heart , and so I invented the glass heart . And then a few nights ago , someone slipped into my room and stole it while I was asleep . I 've done what I can with these batteries . It 's kept me stable , but ... If I don 't get my heart back , I 'll die . You think Peter Bishop stole your heart ? They disappeared at the same time . This heart is priceless . Who knows what somebody would pay for it . I have so much good left to do . If I die , I 'll never get to finish any of them . All of my ideas ... they will all die with me . She 's gonna help him , right ? Of course . But first , she needed to rehire her assistant , Esther Ficklesworth . I have plenty of experience with all kinds of people . I 'm sure that would come in handy , right ? I mean , mental patients probably need tons of patience . And love too . They probably need love , right ? * I really need this job * * please god , I need this job * * I 've got to get this job * I 'm sorry , excuse me . Oh , it 's my old boss now . Can you give me just a second ? She only calls when it 's important . Or when she gets lost . What do you want ? New case . I need you . You sent me packing this morning , and you owe me six months ' back-pay . What makes you think I 'm gonna drop everything just because you call ? Because it 's important . And because that 's just the kind of girl you are . Dunham ? Dunham , are you- - Drop what you 're investigating . Who the hell are you ? I 'm the man who doesn 't let his feelings get him into trouble . Ah ! Don 't stick your heart out where it doesn 't belong . I 'm sorry . Does it hurt ? Oh , no , no , no . It feels great , actually . Please , keep- - keep doing it . I can 't believe you got sucked back into business over true love . You know that 's your problem , isn 't it ? You 're always looking for something that doesn 't even exist . Hey , that 's not true . I 'm not looking for someone who 's gonna give his heart to the world . Maybe somewhere in the universe there 's gotta be a guy who will keep me warm when I 'm cold , feed me when I 'm hungry , and maybe , on occasion , take me dancing . Mm . Huh , that 's odd . It looks like it 's healing . What kind of weapon did you say he used ? Well , nothing that I 'd ever seen before . It was , like , some kind of ... Laser . This is the same kind of wound that killed Rachel . So the man who attacked me is the same man who took her heart . Draw it . Draw what ? The weapon . I have an idea . Yeah , the patent on this device was taken out last year . Pretty cool little device , if I recall . Was patented by this whiz-bang tech company out of Manhattan . Boy , I wish I could work somewhere like that . Big outfit , all kinds of spy stuff . They go by the name of ... Massive Dynamic . You can 't go in there ! Miss Dunham ! A few hours ago , a man attacked me with that , and told me to forget I 'd ever heard the name Peter Bishop . Now I can call the feds or you can tell me the truth . You choose , lady . Bring me the file on the quantum laser . The device was developed here in our biomedical research lab . It was designed as a surgical tool . Several months ago , one of our prototypes was stolen . But tell me ... This man who attacked you , was he bald , with an odd cadence to his voice ? Who is he ? Not he , they . We call them the watchers . These people are dangerous and they don 't make idle threats . You should know what you 're getting into , miss Dunham . She was lying . - Who ? - Nina Sharp . She was lying , wasn 't she ? What makes you think that ? I don 't know , I just don 't trust her . Smart girl . You 're getting ahead of the narrative , but you 're thinking along the right lines . Because detective Olivia didn 't trust her either . Now ... Hello ? it 's me . You got anything ? Nina Sharp 's company , Massive Dynamic , the founder and CEO is a guy named William Bell . You ever heard of him ? No . Should I have ? Well , it seems he 's a sort of scientific Christopher Columbus . He 's always searching for what 's right on the edge of our imagination . But here is the interesting part . In the past few years , no one has seen him . No press conferences , no public appearances . It 's like he just disappeared off the face of the earth . Okay , so what 's that got to do with Peter Bishop ? I don 't know . But that 's weird , right ? Yeah . Listen , I gotta go . Hey , Dunham ? - Yeah ? - Be careful . Okay , ma . I have news . Is it safe to talk ? Of course , no one can hear us . - What is it ? - I found it . - The glass heart ? - Mm , you were right . Peter Bishop has it . So where is he ? Where 's the boy ? We don 't know yet . But we 'll find him . Oh , that 's fabulous news . Well done , Nina . I knew you could do it . William , I 've been going out of my mind . By utilizing the heart 's power , we 'll be able to create a stable door between universes . And after all this time , we can finally be together again . I know , my love . Excuse me . She is awake . I see . I suppose I should feel sorry for you , miss Dunham . None of these should 've been your concerns . The truth is I did everything I could to protect you . I warned you to stay away from this , but you didn 't listen . Now you 've given me no choice . Oh , so you 're gonna send me somewhere far away , where I won 't be able to tell anybody what you wanna do with that glass heart ? Not quite . Go ahead , Mr. Gemini . No , no ! No , no , no ! Ah . Ah ! No ! Help me ! No ! Ah ! I heard you were looking for me . Thank you . And get a second one free . Feeling better ? Do you mean is a hot shower better than drowning in a pine coffin ? Much . Thank you . I take it you don 't live here . No , but nobody else does either . Seemed like a pretty good place to hide out . But this is yours . Yeah . What is it ? You hungry ? So how 'd you know I was drowning ? Coffee ? Yeah , one sugar . Thanks . Well , like I told you before , I heard somebody was looking for me . A cop named Olivia Dunham . So I was following you . Well , someone 's been giving you false information , Because I 'm not a cop , I 'm a private detective . I see . You like jazz ? Jazz ? Miles , Duke , Louis , John Coltrane ... You can tell a lot about a person from the music they listen to . And whether or not they dance . Uh , well , jazz ... Not so much . But dancing ? Sure . Well , I guess we 're opposites . I hate to dance . I 'd take you , though . You would ? Why 's that ? I don 't know , seems like it 'd be fun . You look like a good dancer . You know , all this is very nice , and I 'm grateful that you saved my life , but I know who you are , and I know what you did . Wanna know why I was looking for you ? Dr. Walter Bishop hired me . I know you took his glass heart . Is that what he told you ? That I stole his heart ? What else did Walter Bishop tell you ? That without his heart he would die . And that all the good he does for this world would die with him . Well , I guess I 'm not the only one who 's been given false information . What , yo saying that 's not true ? Come with me . 147 pins . Each one represents a child injured by Walter Bishop . Injured how ? Walter 's invented a great many things . Wondrous things . That much is true . But what he didn 't tell you is where his ideas come from . Elephants , rainbows , licorice sticks ... They come from the dreams of children . He steals children 's dreams and he replaces them with nightmares . That 's what this is , a pattern of destruction . Of damaged kids , shattered innocence . Who else knows about this ? Nobody . I worked for him for years , and I didn 't even know . Why I was willing to die so that he could live . It 's your heart . I was born with it . And I was willing to give it to Walter , 'cause of all the good he 's done . Because of all the good he could do . I thought that his life was so much more valuable than mine . At least until I learned the truth . Walter Bishop isn 't responsible for all the goodness in the world . But he is responsible for so much evil . Oh , hell . What is it ? They found us . Run ! I knew you were a good dancer . You really cut a rug out there . Well , you 're not so bad yourself . I need your help , Olivia . I 'm dying . Okay , I got them . So- - so what do I do ? Well ... You ever play that game operation ? - Yeah . - Well , it 's just like that , except in reverse . You gotta put those batteries into my chest . But whatever you do , don 't touch the nerve endings . And what if I do ? Don 't . Okay . Hey ... You 're gonna be fine . Just go slow , And take them one at a time . Okay . So what made you wanna be a detective ? I don 't know . Uh , I , uh ... I guess that I just always knew what it was I was meant to do . And what 's that ? To care for people . Then who cares for you ? Okay . I did it . Okay . There 's one more . Must be nice to know who you are . To know your place in the world . So what about you ? Oh , I thought I did . I thought I knew who I was . But I was wrong . Done . Peter ? Peter ? Peter ? Please , Peter . * for once in my life * * I have someone who needs me * * someone I 've needed so long * * for once unafraid * * I can go where life leads me * * and somehow I know I 'll be strong * * for once in my life * * I won 't let sorrow hurt me * * not like it 's hurt me before * * for once I have something * * I know won 't desert me * * I 'm not alone anymore * Peter . Hey . Hey . You did it . Okay . You be careful . These batteries aren 't gonna last long . - Okay . - We have to get my heart back . Those men who attacked us , they work for Nina Sharp . But Nina Sharp isn 't the one who 's got your heart . Then who does ? Put it down , dr . Bishop . How did you know it was me ? The device- - the one that came through the wall- - I knew that I had seen it someplace before . You brought Nina Sharp 's watchers to your side . Didn 't you ? Peter . Peter ! I- - I never meant to hurt anyone . I never- - I can change , you 'll see . I can make up for all the harm I 've done . Peter , please . * Who can take the sunrise * * sprinkle it with dew * * the candy man can * Peter , please . It 's too late , Walter . There 's some things you can 't undo . * The candy man can * * ' cause he mixes it with love * * and makes the world taste good * Are you kidding ? That 's not a proper ending . Don 't you know ? All good stories start with " once upon a time , " and they end with " happily ever after . " You don 't know how to tell stories , uncle Walter . I 'll tell you how the story ends . Peter . Peter , please . I can change . I can fix the damage I 've done . Please , give me another chance . And Peter looked inside Walter 's eyes and realized there was still goodness inside him . So Peter took his special heart , and with all his might , he split it in two . And the heart was so magical that it still worked . And together , they made goodness , and lived happily ever after . The end . Aunt Liv ! - We had so much fun . - Did you ? - That 's great . - We played games kind of badly . Then uncle Walter told me a story . I 'm sorry , Walter . No luck . His ending wasn 't very good . It was sad . But I fixed it for him . Didn 't I , uncle Walter ? Yes . Yes , my dear , you were right . Yours was a proper ending . Yours was a much better ending , indeed . The boy has not returned . And I do not believe dr . Bishop remembers my warning . Yes , I am concerned too . Subtitles by Brainquake

 Previously on V ... This is Concordia . Humans think they 're building the future , but they 're digging their own grave . The one thing that Anna can 't give Tyler is his family back together . I heard all about what you did tonight , Jack . You 'll be laicized . I have a daughter , and the only way I can get her back - is to take Anna down . - You 've infiltrated the Fifth Column . I wanna know if there are any threats against us for tonight . Ryan Nichols just reported in . The Fifth Column is positioned to assassinate you . I will take your place . If we can 't cut the head off the beast , - we can at least rob it of its right hand . - Do it . In headlines this morning , Visitor high commander Anna has yet to break her silence regarding the condition of her second in command , Marcus , following last night 's shocking assassination attempt at the gala Concordia event . No one has taken credit , but there is very little doubt that the anti-v terrorist group the Fifth Column was behind the shooting . If you ask me , it is only a matter of time before Anna is going to lose her cool , and then it is not going to be " of peace , always " anymore . Here 's another thought , Kerry . How about we , in the tradition of civilized beings , agree to hope for good news on Marcus ' condition and swift justice for those responsible for this shooting ? The bullet that struck you was meant for me . Your sacrifice will be avenged , Marcus . I will hunt down and kill Eli Cohn and the Fifth Column . They will pay for what they 've done . You look like someone just told you Santa Claus isn 't real . I 've just spent the last six hours getting raked over the coals by the FBI after-action team . I have been benched because Marcus was shot on my watch . Benched ? What do you mean ? W ... For how long ? Not sure . Kendrick told me to stand by for more debriefing . Told him I was gonna go spend time with my family , which is good because that is exactly where I wanna be . So go home . If the FBI suspects anything , we 're all screwed . They suspect everything . Everyone is under the lens . We have to give Eli a heads-up . The Fifth Column has to keep their heads down for now . You 're right . There 's gonna be enough heat coming from Anna . Yeah , well , if Ryan hadn 't sold us out , Anna would be dead . We got a mole , and until he 's flushed out , we 're all in danger . Anyone heard from him ? No , but when we do , I 'm putting a long overdue bullet in him . I need to look him in the eye first , hear him say it . Well , we have to find him for that . Then do it . It 's gonna be okay , sweetheart . I can 't get her to stop crying . She 's grown quite fond of me , as if I were her own mother . But my touch will only soothe her for a moment . She 'll need my bliss . What do you want ? The man responsible for the attempt on Marcus ' life ... Eli Cohn . Tell him you wanna meet ... Then kill him . The Fifth Column 's attack on Marcus must be met with a response immediately . Eli will know that I sold him out and warned you about the assassination . There 's no way I 'll be able to get close enough to him now to kill him . You were once my best hunter , Ryan . You 'll find a way . The official papal decree regarding your status as a member of the priesthood . You 've been laicized , Jack . How many times have I warned you your hatred would cost you your faith ? I hasn 't cost me my faith . You must move out of the rectory within the week . I 'm sorry . Father Travis , I would ... I would like to lead one last service for my parishioners . They are no longer your parishioners , Jack . I must ask you for your collar . Uhh ! Aah ! Uhh ! Judas returns to complete his betrayal . Drop it . Take him . Alive . Aah ! God help you now . Uhh ! Uhh ! Hey , mom , you sure you can keep up with us ? I mean , the Harley is a lot of bike . Yeah , seriously , the question is , can you two keep up with me ? Ohh ! ( Laughs ) Nice ! Okay . It has just ... it 's been so long since the three of us spent time together . It 's too long . Evans . I found Ryan . How ? He tried to kill me . Hang on . Hey , guys , uh , I 'll just be a second . I 'll meet you out there . Work . What are you gonna do , Eli ? Find out everything he told the Visitors about us ... And assure he never says anything again . Wait . Let me talk to him first . He 's your associate , so out of respect , I 'll wait . Make no mistake , either by my hands or yours , Ryan Nichols is gonna die . The tracker you sent to follow Ryan Nichols has reported in . He followed him to Eli Cohn 's base . Ryan has been captured . There are over 20 heavily armed men inside the building . Shall I initiate an attack ? No . The window of opportunity is closing . It 's only just opening , Thomas . Call the FBI , anonymously . Report a gathering of Eli Cohn and the Fifth Column terrorists and give a location . Let the humans do the dirty work while our hands remain clean . After their embarrassment over Marcus ' shooting , the FBI won 't hesitate to use deadly force . I expect the Fifth Column will be happy to fight back . Yeah . Just received an anonymous tip , possible Eli Cohn sighting . Abandoned building on the Upper East Side . - You trust it ? - After the assassination fiasco , we can 't afford not to . You think we should call Evans ? Well , Chris , you 're running the I.A. investigation into her . What do you think ? If she 's dirty like we suspect , we can 't risk she 'd tip ' em off . Okay . For now , we keep Evans out of the loop . My God , Ryan . I told you to wait . He 's a traitor and was treated as such . Look at me . Why did you do this ? Why did you betray us ? Erica , you gotta get out of here right now . Not until you tell me the truth . Anna made my baby sick . She promised she would help if I did what she asked . But , Erica , you gotta listen to me , okay ? I came here for Eli , not you . Anna knows I 'm here . She put a tracker on my tail . If you don 't get out of here right now , you 're dead . You 're all dead . Surveillance has picked up unusual movement . - Multiple units approaching . - Is that enough truth for you ? Those aren 't Visitors . It 's FBI . That 's my team . No ! Those are my friends , my colleagues . I won 't let you kill them . You won 't let me kill them , - but you 're okay with them killing us ? - No , I 'm not . That is my unit . I know exactly what we need to do in order to avoid a bloodbath . Tell your men no kill shots . What then ? Then we 'll find a way out of here . So much for trying to find a way out of here . - Looks like the entire FBI showed up . - You 're right . Everyone did show up ... Everyone except for me . - I didn 't get a call . - They don 't trust you anymore . No , they think I 'm working with you , collaborating with the Fifth Column . We 're surrounded , Erica . I-I can 't get you out . You don 't have to . I 'm staying ... As a hostage . That solves two problems . It clears you being here and buys us time to figure a way out of this . Hit me . If I 'm going to sell that I 'm a hostage , I need to look like one . Hit me . The waiting game continues here on the streets of New York outside Eli Cohn 's building , where Cohn , the mastermind behind the recent Fifth Column attacks , may be holed up inside . We got no live phone lines into the building , and it 's gonna take an hour minimum to sweep for any cell numbers that might be inside . Okay , whatever you get as soon as you get it . Okay . Chris , you might wanna look at this . Oh , my God . That 's Erica . - That 's Erica . - How the hell did she get up there ? I don 't know , but she just gave us our line of communication . We just got word that Eli Cohn is holding hostages inside the building . Tyler 's mother is inside . That wasn 't part of your plan . No , but maybe we can use it to our advantage . Perhaps seeing his mother die at the hands of the humans will turn him back to us . His mother dying isn 't enough . His father must die as well . Find a way to get Joe Evans inside that building . Tyler is critical to the future of our plans . His emotional ties to his family are all that keep him from us . It is time to sever them once and for all . You wanted to see me , mother ? Tyler has decided to postpone his flight training . With the plans for Concordia moving ahead , it 's critical that he be aboard the ship as we prepare for the next phase . Yes . Of course , mother . You must do everything in your power to ensure his cooperation . Go , go , go ! Oh , he 's at the 20 ! Yes ! Come on , go , go , go ! Go , go , go , go ! Ohh ! Ooh ! Go , go ! Yes ! The 30 ! Go , go , go ! Go , go , go ! Oh , the 20 ! Here we go ! Man down ! Go ! Ohh ! - Man , we got a good team this year ! - Oh ! I know . Oh , sweet . ... Because of a shoulder injury ... I 'm really glad you 're back , dad . Me , too . Hey , Lise . ... Run back a punt 78 yards . What ? No ... no way . Okay , I will . We have to turn on the news , dad . The hostage has now been identified as FBI task force leader Erica Evans , with unconfirmed reports of others being held inside the building as well , I 'll figure something out , Ty . I promise . But I gotta get down there . You stay here , okay ? I 'll call you as soon as I know anything . Hey . It 's gonna be all right . Erica ? Chris , I have a list of Eli 's demands . Number one , sharpshooters stand down . Two , pull all TAC teams . Three , any air cover , and I 'm dead . I got it . Erica , are you all right ? I 'm ... Well played . I 'm impressed . Well , I know how the FBI works , Eli . I only see two ways out of here for you ... Dead or in cuffs . Not quite . There might be a third way . This technology will allow you to see inside the building ... And locate explosives of any size . You will be able to anticipate the terrorists ' every move . We 're grateful for your help , Thomas . Please send my thanks to Anna . It is our only hope that our technology will allow you to end this standoff peacefully , with no loss of life . Joe Evans , agent Evans ' ex-husband , just arrived on the scene . He wants an update . Well , go talk to him . The last thing we need is panicked family right now . Joe Evans ? Yeah . Agent Ray Caldwell , hostage rescue team leader . - You must be Erica 's ex . - How did you know ? Erica 's a friend . She mentioned you were back . Seemed real happy about that . Right . Look , Erica is in danger in there . What are you guys doing about it ? We found a hidden entrance into the building that the Fifth Column doesn 't know about . So w-why aren 't you in there now ? The Fifth Column guys are dangerous . The bosses know it so they 're running scared , holding us up for now . - But once we have a " go , " I promise you ... - Mm-hmm . We will do everything we can to get Erica back safely . Copy that . Situation outside . Gotta go . Hey , uh ... Who 's that ? It 's my son and my husband . Uh , ex ... ex-husband . I was supposed to spend the day with them , no Visitors , no Fifth Column ... Just us as a family . I keep this . Ohh . In times like this , it reminds me of what I 'm fighting for ... Families like yours , families the V 's haven 't destroyed yet . And if we have something to say about it , they never will . Eli . Uhh ! Found him in the basement . Broke through an old bricked-up tunnel . Joe ? Joe , what are you doing here ? I saw it on TV , you taken hostage . I had to come . Where 's Tyler ? He 's at home . He 's safe . I 'm ... I 'm okay . Erica , what 's going on in here , huh ? You told me about the V 's , but I ... It 's complicated . Look , I 'm ... I 'm ... I 'm not a hostage . I 'm with these people . How did you get in here ? W ... How did you get past the FBI barricade ? Through a tunnel . Friend of yours ... Ray Caldwell from the H.R.T ... . he , uh , he left some plans behind that showed a hidden route in . Erica , if you 're not a hostage , why aren 't we running for that tunnel ? Because I 've never heard of agent Ray Caldwell . It 's an old bootlegger 's tunnel . They must 've run liquor through it here during prohibition time . Never knew it existed . Why would an agent leave critical plans like these for a civilian to find ? They wouldn 't , but a sleeper V might . Okay , why would the V 's want your ex-husband in here ? - Come on , dad ! - Tyler , I 'm sure he 's okay . I-I gotta get down there . Please , Ty , you promised your dad you 'd stay here . Yeah , and he promised he 'd call . - If everything was okay , he would . - Tyler ... I 'm going . I 'll call you in a bit . The FBI was grateful for our assistance . What about Joe Evans ? Inside the building , as you requested . Good . Soon Eli Cohn and the Fifth Column will be destroyed , and I 'll have Tyler back . With agent Evans inside and at risk , the FBI will not take aggressive action . They will not have to . Marcus has an asset on the ground ... Kyle Hobbes . - He 's a mercenary . He 'll do as we ask . - Do we need a human ? He won 't stand out like a soldier or a tracker . Nothing will trace back to us , and all the blood spilled will be by the hands of the humans . Something 's not right . - What ? - Those snipers ... they 're locking onto targets they couldn 't possibly see . My men are hidden . How does the FBI know where they are ? Anna must be helping them somehow . If the FBI is moving in , it means they 're getting ready to storm the building , take your men out . What are you doing ? I 'm buying us more time . All right , on my signal . Everybody , stay back ! Stay back ! Stay back and let us through or we 're gonna blow all of you to pieces ! Lower your weapon ! Stand down . Abort the action . - Stay back ! - They 've got explosives and hostages . What the hell are you doing ? Taking hostages is not our deal ! Those aren 't just hostages . They 're your lifeline . I didn 't agree to this , Eli . Those are innocents . I told you I wouldn 't do it this way . Look around you , Erica . No one is safe . Your son 's father is out there , delivered from the safety of his home into this crucible . And he may die . We may all die . And why ? Because of Anna and the Visitors . If we don 't protect the innocents , then we are no better than the Visitors . The hostages , right now , are the only way to ensure that you live , that Tyler 's father lives , and that the Fifth Column lives . I will die for this cause if I have to . I have no illusions I 'm gonna walk out of here alive . But you and Joe must , and so must he . John Fierro , my most trusted colleague ... He knows all my Fifth Column contacts all over the world , every plan , every detail . I 've led my share of battles against the Visitors . Those battles are yours now . You want me to lead ? Why me ? We couldn 't disagree more about how to fight this war . Maybe , but I 've seen something in you , something that 's far more important . See , you understand that this fight is for our future , for our families ' futures , and at the end of the day , that 's what this cause needs more than anything . Now take these people out to safety . Protect your cover , come out a hero . Live to fight Anna another day . Excuse me , sir . Excuse me . Let me get through here , please . - Look , I gotta get in ... - Nobody gets in . Nobody . What ? Hobbes . - Have you heard what 's going on ? - Oh , the standoff ? Hard not to . Look , you gotta get down here . I got a feeling the V 's are somehow in the middle of all this . Too hot for me to be anywhere near there , Jack . Remember , I 'm a wanted man . Keep me posted , eh ? No . H-Hobbes ... Kyle Hobbes ? My name is Thomas . I have an assignment for you from Anna . As fun as that sounds , I think I 'll bloody pass . You made a deal with Marcus . You work for us , she stays alive . Right . Problem is , Sarah 's dead . She died five years ago . Her body was never recovered . You should know this . You 've searched for her for years . Lucky for you , we found her . I want proof of life . Kyle , they 've got me . Please help . Sarah ? - Where is she ? ! - You pull that trigger , you 'll never find out . Bring this within 100 yards of Eli Cohn 's building . It will detonate the explosives brought inside by the suicide bombers . Do it or you will never see Sarah alive again . Come to check on the handiwork of your friends , Landry ? - People are scared . I 'm here to help . - You 're damn right they 're scared , because of people like you . You had your chance to help , maybe could 've even prevented this . But right now my partner , my friend , is in there . - You wanna help ? - Get your hands off me . You better pray she gets out of this alive , because if she doesn 't , I 'm coming for you . I came to say good-bye . Don 't leave me here , Erica . I had no one to help me save my daughter , no one to turn to but Anna . No , you had me . You could 've come to me . - Why didn 't you ? - I never planned for you to be here . You betrayed us , not just the Fifth Column , but me . You betrayed me and Jack ... your friends . We trusted you . We fought beside you . We defended you . I gave you my word , and I will do everything that I can to help your daughter , but I can never forgive you . I 'm sorry . It 's too late . It 's time . Yeah . Fierro 's going to blend in and walk out with the hostages . I 'll lead the way . Prove me right about you , Erica Evans . Hey . You ready ? Yeah . - Good . - Erica . I , uh , I should 've trusted you . It 's in the past . We have so much time to make up for . Let 's go home . Okay , our snipers have Cohn 's men in their sites . Be ready to move on my signal , and stay sharp . This could happen at any time . Hit it . Hello ? Chris , this is not going by the book . The FBI should be negotiating , not getting ready to move in . There is no one else that I trust . - That 's why I called your cell . - What 's going on ? Eli wants to release the hostages , but first , he wants some assurances . He wants the chance to surrender . And I want assurances , too . I wanna make sure that once we 're out in the open , the hostages will get to safety . I 'll make sure no one on our side fires a shot unless they 're fired upon . As far as Cohn 's assurances go , you should tell him whatever he wants to hear , but he 's not walking away from this . I understand . But first , we make sure the hostages are safe . Okay . Deal . ... Eli Cohn has once again taken the world by surprise . Upping the ante as this tense standoff with the Fifth Column continues , as we now wait to hear of any demands made ... Is Mr. Hobbes in position ? Yes , my queen . He is on site and awaits your order . Any moment now , we 're going to see the hostages being led out to safety . And here they come now . Agent Erica Evans is among the hostages . Come on , let 's go ! Aah ! Watch your fire ! We got an agent leading the hostages out there . Chris , I need some help ! Go ! Help Chris ! Take them to safety ! Go ! ♪ No , Erica ! No ! No ! No ! No ! ♪ Uhh ! I 'm here . Come on . Come on , baby ! Come on ! Come on ! Oh , God . Cease fire ! Cease fire ! ♪ Come on , come on . Joe . My God . What just happened here ? ♪ Ty ? Tyler ? Hey . I know . We were wrong about her . She 's clean , Paul . I 'll kill the paperwork . The investigation into Erica Evans is over . Once again , mother , I have succeed where you failed . The Fifth Column has been devastated . Don 't worry . You 'll hear from them again . My breeding program is back on track . All that 's left is to conquer the soul . How long are we going to do this , daughter ? Do what ? This dance . You come down here , you circle me , you gloat . It 's unbecoming of a queen and a sign of weakness . Unlike you , I have no weaknesses . Then why do you feel the need to prove yourself to me ? Prove myself ? To a broken queen , rotting down here in the dungeon ? Why would I need to do that ? Because you need me . You wouldn 't be down here if you didn 't . I understand now what you 've been trying to do , and it will not work . What will not work ? Your attempt to fuel human emotions in me . Every time I come down here , you strike at my nerves so that I 'll lose control and destroy my ability to lead . And I thought it was working so well . If you want to destroy me ... Try harder . Oh ... I will . Back so soon ? Lisa ? Who are you ? Don 't be frightened . I am your grandmother ... Diana . I knew you 'd find me eventually . I don 't understand . I was told you were dead . No one must know , not yet . It 's our secret . How do I know I can trust you ? Because we share the same enemy ... your mother . Tyler ? Where are you going ? Where do you think ? No . No . Tyler , please . I need you . We are still a family . Family ? What family ? Dad 's dead . It 's Anna 's fault . - All of it . - No , mom . You always blame the V 's , but it was people , not the Visitors , that killed dad today . Tyler , you 're wrong . You are wrong . I promise you . I did everything that I could to save him . Well , you didn 't do enough . If you would 've done your job , if you would 've protected him , if you would 've stopped the Fifth Column like you were supposed to , then maybe dad would be alive ! I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Erica ... I am so sorry . Joe is dead . Tyler left ... to live aboard the ship , and there ... There 's nothing I can do about it . Eli left me in charge of the Fifth Column he built ... every cell , every soldier around the world . My first act as leader will be to declare that we go on the offensive . No more reacting to Anna . We strike first . We strike hard . Who 's with me ? I was a soldier once . I 'll be a soldier again . I 'm in ... no matter the cost . I should have listened to you about Ryan . Sorry . Nah , it 's on me . Should 've taken the lizard out when I had the chance . I got you into this because I needed a warrior . But I 've kept you caged . Not anymore . You 've got me , Erica ... Come what bloody may . Good . We have an army now . And we are going to rain hell on the Visitors .

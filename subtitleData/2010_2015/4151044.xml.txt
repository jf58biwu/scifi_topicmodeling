 NARRATOR : Previously on V : - Are others like you fighting Anna ? RYAN : They 're called the Fifth Column . Crush them before they become a great threat . If you 're Fifth Column , things are about to get very bad . A human female is carrying a Visitor baby . Find them . You 've been looking for me . I found what you 're really looking for . - Joshua said you pass the empathy test . - Why ? Because one day , I 'll ask a favor from you . LISA : If my mother 's eggs are allowed to hatch those soldiers will destroy the Fifth Column . Yes , they will . [ CHOMPING NEARBY ] [ ROARING ] [ GRUNTING ] LEAH : You 're doing great , Val . Keep breathing . - Unh ! LEAH : You 're 2 centimeters . This baby 's coming . Can I get you anything ? - Yeah , a glass of water . I 'm thirsty . - Okay . [ PANTING ] [ LEAH GASPS ] [ VAL SCREAMING ] No ! Aah ! You have a look . What 's up ? - I wanna talk to you about Live Aboard . - Tyler . I get that you 're not crazy about the idea , believe me . But it 's important to me . And I understand your concern about me moving up there , and so does Anna . - Really ? - She even invited us up for dinner . I mean , just me , you , Lisa and Anna . - Okay . - What ? Okay . [ CHUCKLES ] - Take your food . - Oh , yeah . - I love you . - You too . [ LINE RINGS ] Jack , it 's Erica . Get everyone to the church . I have a plan . [ BELLS TOLLING ] - Where 's Ryan ? - I 'm not sure . What 's going on ? Why 'd you call us here ? Tyler 's joining the Live Aboard program . I can 't stop him , but I can stop Anna . I don 't understand . Ryan told us Anna 's V soldier eggs are about to hatch . If she has thousands of V soldiers at her disposal ... - We 're dead . - We are out of time . This is it . You suggest we storm the ship , kill all the eggs ? That is exactly what I 'm suggesting . - My kind of plan . Like your spunk . - None of us have been there . - We don 't know where the eggs are . - No , we don 't . Joshua does . It 's never gonna happen . We had a plan to take out the eggs . Since the shuttle was shot down , Anna 's practically locked down the ship . - There has to be something we can do . - Two ways into the incubation chamber : A guarded corridor and an entrance in Anna 's private quarters . - Not even I can get in there anymore . ERICA [ OVER PHONE ] : I can . Anna invited Tyler and me onto her ship for dinner . - Too dangerous . - Create a diversion to get Anna out so that Erica 's got time to get to the eggs . Dinner 's at 7 . You 'll need an explosive to destroy the eggs . Now we 're talking . What kind ? [ V 'S SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OUTSIDE ] I have to go . Contact me when everything 's set up . We need to know you 'll be here , if we risk everything on our end . We will . Marcus released another wave of guards . They 're searching everyone . You gotta get rid of the comms device . They find it on you , we 'll all be exposed . You haven 't returned our calls . You okay ? I needed my line to be free . - My baby 's being born . - What ? Waiting for Dr. Pearlman to give me a call , but haven 't heard from her . What 's going on ? Erica 's been invited up to the ship . She 's gonna destroy Anna 's soldier eggs . - Are you serious ? - Yeah . I 'm going with you . You 're gonna need my help . Ryan , I think you should stay here , in case Val or the baby need you . Once you get there , then what ? Anna 's never gonna let you out of her sight . Joshua 's planning a diversion . Anna will be pulled away for safety . Then she 'll make her move . What about Marcus ? He 's her watchdog . Can 't pull this off under his nose . I can get Marcus off the ship . Well , top of the V 's most-wanted list . Makes me excellent bait . Okay , well , to do this , Erica 's gonna need the layout of the ship . Every detail you can remember . Everything . MARCUS : The armada of ships from our home planet have arrived ahead of schedule . They 're within striking range of Earth . Keep them cloaked and at bay . We don 't want them revealed until we 're ready for the next stage . Tyler 's mother is joining you tonight for dinner as planned ? With Agent Evans as my ally on the ground and my newborn army the humans won 't know what hit them . We got a problem . - The comms device isn 't working . JACK : What ? We 're supposed to confirm with Joshua we 're a go . If we can 't reach him , you 're not going . Well , we could try skywriting . [ SIGHS ] - I could go to Chad Decker . - No . Anna 's lapdog ? I prefer the skywriting idea . Unless someone has a better idea , I don 't see we have a choice . Chad is the one who went to Anna with our plans to blow up the shuttle . Chad is the one who went on air to convince people to follow her , to keep her here . What makes you think you can trust him ? I don 't . That 's why we 'll have him deliver a message he and she won 't understand . Look , we 're covered either way . He doesn 't go to Anna , he 'll deliver the message , we 're a go . If he takes it right to her ? Then Anna gets her hands on a message that means nothing to her . [ CELL PHONE RINGS ] LEAH [ OVER PHONE ] : Ryan , they got Val . It all happened so fast . You 've gotta find her . [ DOOR CLOSES ] Anna has my baby . Tell her Ryan Nichols is here . You don 't have clearance . [ ALL GRUNTING ] Get off me . Let him aboard . I wanna talk to him . He 's dangerous . Why don 't we destroy him like any other traitor ? He was able to resist my bliss . He fell in love with a human and turned Fifth Column . You don 't understand what we have in him . - An enemy . - Insight into our enemy . The very thing that fuels humans . Love . That 's exactly why we have to study him up close . If we can turn him back to us , we can turn anyone . Father . Your call sounded urgent . What can I do for you ? Yes , I was given this message from one of my parishioners . Needs to be delivered to the mothership . You have access . Delivered to who , exactly ? I don 't know . If you agree to help , you 're to leave it in the medical bay . You 're saying there are Visitors who are part of the Fifth Column ? Yes , Chad . Even her own kind are turning on Anna now . This message . I 'm guessing it isn 't a Hallmark card . - I wouldn 't know . I 'm just a messenger . - I 'm tired of playing games , Father . The Fifth Column blew up a shuttle full of innocent human beings . All I 've seen Fifth Column do is hurt people . They 're lies , Chad . The shuttle shoot-down was a setup . Anna wants to paint the Fifth Column as terrorists , gather public support . And thanks to you , she succeeded . Please , Chad . - Lisa . - What is it , Joshua ? That favor you owe me ? It 's time to repay it . At 7 : 00 , we 'll create a diversion so your mother 's eggs can be destroyed before they hatch . What ? Those soldiers are bred for destruction , Lisa . To kill humans . Here , take this . Joshua , you 're asking me to betray my mother to murder my own kind . I 'm sorry . I can 't . You know she has a plan for Tyler , the humans . It 's time for you to decide which side you 're really on . Get off me . Where is she ? Valerie 's here . And she 's safe for now . I just wish you would 've come to me sooner . Valerie 's pregnancy is exceedingly risky . It 's a miracle . - So you kidnapped her ? ANNA : To save her . If we 'd have asked , would you have let me ? - She could 've died down there . - You 're lying . You don 't care about saving her . All you wanna do is run tests , like she 's a lab rat . You can fight us or you can help us fight to save her life . It 's your choice . [ GROANS ] [ VAL GASPS ] Ryan . I 'm so glad you 're here . Oh . - We have to get out of here . - You don 't have to be afraid , okay ? - But you warned me about the Visitors . RYAN : We don 't have a choice now . Because your pregnancy is just really complicated , it 's dangerous . We need their technology to deliver the baby . [ GROANS ] Oh , it 's coming , Ryan . I 'm scared . Val , I 'm so sorry for what I put you through . I 'm sorry I left . I love you . I don 't wanna do this alone . Any of it . You don 't have to . I 'm here now . Everything is gonna be okay . [ GROANING ] Her vitals are dropping . Baby 's crowning . You 'll have to wait outside . It 's okay . It 's okay . - Are you sure ? - Yes . Please , let them save the baby . RYAN : I 'll be right outside . If you ask me , we need to send you up to that UFO more often . ERICA : Is that the explosive ? - Yeah . The bomb you 'll use to scramble the bitch 's eggs is a next-gen gel explosive . Unlike nitrates and peroxides , it gives off no signature . Even alien technology won 't pick this puppy up . What 's with the handbag ? Oh , I 'm just gonna hide it in the lining here . And it 's a clutch , not a handbag . - What 's the initiator ? - You got your cell phone ? Okay . You slip it in here , like so . You set the timer , and boom . ERICA : Cool . Marcus will be off the ship by 1900 . He 's second in command . How are you gonna get him off the ship ? I 'm gonna grab a gecko by the Peace Ambassador Center . Have him get a message to the ship to set a meeting with Marcus . And then I 'll ambush their ambush . That sounds dangerous . I 've walked away from much worse . Good . Erica , you be careful . Like you said , Anna has an agenda too , okay ? Where did you get this ? From an intermediary . The same source who gave me the information about the shuttle . I 'm keeping an eye on him . I 'm close to finding out who 's behind the message . Fifth Column . My instructions were to leave this envelope in the medical lab . There are Visitors working with the Fifth Column ? No . My people are loyal and of peace . This message must have been intended for the Live Aboard humans . It seems we 've been infiltrated , even up here . Deliver this as instructed . I just don 't wanna see anyone else get hurt . Don 't worry , Chad . As soon as we stop the Fifth Column , nobody else will . MARCUS : Put the gun down , Mr. Hobbes . We have a lot to talk about . I believe you have something for me as well . Parker 's research . Half of Parker 's research . I kept the other half in a safe place . You like to play games , Mr. Hobbes ? Now , you really think I 'm gonna show up here without an insurance policy ? You want the other half ? I want answers . - Why did you frame me ? - Because I 'd like to hire you . And what makes you think I 'd ever work for you ? Because you already have been , for years . Shall we talk , Mr. Hobbes ? - Ready for dinner ? - Yeah , I 'm ready . Don 't embarrass me ? Okay . [ FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ] Welcome aboard , Agent Evans . There are no firearms or any personal items allowed in Anna 's private quarters . - Your bag . - You don 't trust me with my purse ? Mom , they 're just trying to be safe . What if I get a call from work ? You can keep your phone . I 'm sorry , ma 'am . It 's our policy . ANNA : Erica , Tyler . Welcome to the ship . Thank you for inviting us to your home . I 'm thrilled you could make it . - Hello , Mrs. Evans . - Hello , Lisa . It 's lovely to see you . Please . I 'll join you in a moment . I have a matter I need to attend to . JOSHUA : Mr. Decker . How can I help you ? I was told to deliver something here from a friend of yours on the ground . [ CHUCKLES ] I don 't have any friends on the ground . I think you must have the wrong person . My mistake . Must be for someone else . What if that was from Erica ? Why didn 't you take it ? Chad Decker is Anna 's willing pawn . He can 't be trusted . Warn the others not to engage with Decker . Anna may be using him to weed out Fifth Column . - Isn 't time . I can send out a message to everyone at once . I 'll erase it quickly so it can 't be tracked back to them . - What choice do we have ? - Do it . [ COMPUTER BEEPING ] Why 'd you use me ? You are a man with a history of selling your loyalty to the highest bidder . We want to continue to retain your services . - To do what ? - Infiltrate a terrorist group known as the Fifth Column . And if I say no ? You won 't . Heh . Well , I got the research you so desperately want . I got the leverage here , chief , not you . We play by my rules or I walk out of here and you 'll never find me . Well , we may not be able to find you . But we found her . Now let 's talk about the Fifth Column , shall we ? [ DOOR OPENS ] Track down everyone that message was sent to . Put him with the others when you find them . Anna will deal with you . This was for you . You set us up . They 'll all be caught . - And ? - And ? They 'll be skinned alive . You 're lying . Anna would never do that . No , Chad . You 've been fooled like the rest of the humans . The Fifth Column is trying to save humanity . She lied to you . Anna didn 't cure your aneurism . She gave you one . I don 't believe you . There 's a door to a restricted corridor 50 feet from Anna 's executive suite where they take the Live Aboards . What you see there will answer all your questions . This is your homily for tonight , then , is it ? The Visitors as false prophets . Do you think that 's wise speaking out against them after all the good they 've done ? I 've been quiet about my feelings about the V 's for too long , Father . - They 're dangerous . - Dangerous ? People are worshipping them instead of God . Growing dependent on them . This is my opportunity to speak my mind from my pulpit . It 's more than an opportunity . It 's an obligation . Jack , the Visitors are a miracle . How can you be sure that Anna isn 't sent by our Lord ? That the Visitors aren 't his handiwork ? You told me I lost touch with my parishioners because I haven 't spoken from my heart . This is what 's in my heart . I want you to speak to them , but not like that . I will not allow a message of hate to be preached from my pulpit . Write a different homily . And if I don 't ? This is still my church , Jack . Speak out against the Visitors and you are no longer welcome here . [ GRUNTING ] - That 's it . Okay . TECH : Breathe . I got it . - Yeah . - One more push . TECH : That 's it . [ GROANS ] [ VAL PANTING ] [ BABY CRYING ] My baby . I wanna see my baby . Both the baby and mother are stable . I 'm pleased the baby survived . The mother , however , did not . [ VAL GASPING ] [ EKG BEEPING FASTER ] Must be challenging being a single mother , isn 't it ? Well , it can be difficult at times , but it 's worth every minute . Head of the task force , a teenage son . - How do you do it all ? - Same as you , I guess . Lots of worrying . Okay , I am sure that the Visitors have overprotective mothers too , right ? We do . We just show our feelings differently . Erica , I want you to know that you have nothing to worry about . We 're gonna take wonderful care of Tyler when he comes to Live Aboard . - Think it 's safe with the Fifth Column ? - Mom , come on . I 'm sorry . Between the two of us , I 'm sure we 'll make certain it 's safe . But this is a social occasion . May I pour you some more ? Oh , I 'd love that . Thank you . [ CELL PHONE RINGING ] Oh , I 'm sorry . It 's work . Please excuse me . - Of course . ERICA : Yes ? Ah , Lisa . I was just looking for my purse . No , you weren 't . I know why you 're here . It 's that way . And you 'll need this . - Lisa ... - It 's a Blue Energy grenade . It will freeze the eggs . Twist the top to activate . Place it in the center of the pool and get out as fast as you can . There was supposed to be a diversion . What happened ? - I don 't know . - Okay . No . You 'll be gone too long . It will cast suspicion . Go back inside . I 'll figure something out . Good luck . - Lisa . - Joshua , what happened ? We were set up by Chad Decker . Everyone 's been rounded up . Get me out , I can cause a diversion . You were right . I had to choose which side I 'm on , and I did . I gave Erica the Blue Energy grenade . How do I get you out of here ? I placed a bug in the med-lab security system in case I needed to disable it . The code is " John May lives . " What are you going to do ? Whatever I have to . Go back to dinner . I 'll wait 15 minutes to cause the diversion so you 're not suspected . You 're very brave , Joshua . Thank you my queen . [ METAL CLANKING AND WOMAN SCREAMING ] [ SCREAMING INTENSIFIES ] Your ship is beautiful , but you must get homesick . I know I would . It 's been difficult , yes . GUARD : High commander , we need to move you to a secure location . ANNA : What 's happened ? - Fifth Column . We 're being attacked . - Tell Marcus to return to the ship . - I can help . I need my gun . - It 's okay . She 's an ally . - Follow me . [ EGGS SQUELCHING ] Here 's to your children 's future , Anna . [ CROWD SCREAMING ] V 1 : Oh , my God ! V 2 : Stop ! GUARD : Move , move , move ! [ V 3 GRUNTING ] [ WEAPON FIRING ] Stop . It 's done . Now , how do I get you out of here ? There can be no suspicion you 're Fifth Column . - You have to kill me . - No , I won 't . Come on . I 'm dead anyway , Erica . You have to do this for all of us . We both know that . [ SIGHS ] ERICA : Don 't . Come on . [ CROWD SHOUTING ] [ GRUNTS ] ANNA : Thank you . Shooting that terrorist saved many lives . ERICA : To protect the Visitors , that 's my job now , Anna . - Get a look at the shooter ? - Pillars were in the way . I saw he had a V uniform . - He wasn 't a V. He was a human . - What ? My security team reported that a human infiltrated the ship and stole a V uniform . They 're still gathering the details . Anna , I 'm sorry . If there 's anything I can do ... Excuse me . Thank you for delivering that message . We 're hoping it 'll help us expose more Fifth Column . I would hate to see them drive you away . They won 't . And thank you for your loyalty . You 've trusted us with your career and your health . Without us , you 'd lose everything . Anna , thank you for an eventful evening . - I hope we can do it again sometime . - You can count on it . Ty . You killed her , didn 't you ? You said yourself , I have use for her . Why would I kill her ? We did everything we could to keep her alive . If you 'd come earlier , we could 've used our technology to save her life . This is what I was trying to protect you from . Human emotion . I 'm so sorry you lost her . But now ... Now you have me . [ HYMN PLAYING ON ORGAN ] HOBBES : You made it back in one piece . - Good on you . - Heh . I couldn 't have done it if Marcus was there . I didn 't think you 'd come through . Guess I was wrong . You wouldn 't be the first . JACK : There 's a story in the Bible about a man who loses his way only to find it again . I 'm here today to tell you that I am that man . I was lost , but now now I am found . I lost the courage to tell you the truth . That you need to choose who you are going to follow . The V 's or God . Because you can 't serve two masters . I know some of you are confused . But we must stand for what we believe . We must reaffirm our devotion to God and renounce the V 's as false prophets . Even a single Judas in our midst can defeat us . [ PARISHIONERS MURMURING ] There is a war upon us . JACK : A war for our souls . You are not alone . You will never be alone . No pain . No heartache . No human emotion . Just peace . My peace . JACK : But with love hope and faith , we can overcome anything . Who among you will join me ? Let V no longer stand for Visitor . Let V stand for victory . TRAVIS : I told you not to preach that message in my church . JACK : I 'll speak my heart . If you don 't let me do it here , I 'll do it somewhere else . Jack , this will end badly . Now there 's someone I 'd like you to meet . [ BABY COOING ] Welcome home . MARCUS : I just found out . We believe it was Joshua . As your chief medical officer he must have gained access to your private chambers and planted a bomb . We had everything completely locked down . He couldn 't have done this alone . Find out who else is responsible , at whatever cost . Are they all ... dead ? Only 12 soldiers survived . Their core temperatures were severely affected . We don 't know how many will make it . [ SCREAMS ] [ SOBBING ] What 's happening to me ? I believe you 're experiencing your first human emotion . No ! MARCUS : This is terrible , to be sure , but we must not act rashly . They must pay . This is too soon . If we initiate the sequence now ... [ GRUNTS ] [ COMPUTER BEEPS ] Do you know what you 've done ? Vengeance . [ THUNDER RUMBLING ] [ GASPING ] Welcome back . [ ENGLISH - US - SDH ]

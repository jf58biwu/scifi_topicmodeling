You will manage the facility . - Won 't you have some ? - A little water only . - Dad ... - That was not the intention . Do you have children ? - No , but I love kids . - I 'll call you . There are perhaps only two of us left . Do not forget who you are : a child of David . Humans are controlled by their emotions . I love you ... - The code is gone . - David 's mother called sometimes . And ... she might still be alive . - Hey , it 's parent-teacher at Sofia 's school on Thursday . - Oh ? - I 'll do it then . DOOR BELL RINGS - Tobbe needs money for shoes . - I 'll give it to him . - Mom ! For you ! - Coming . - What 's this ? - A hubot . - Sign please . - Did you order one ? - No . - Tobbe , help . - We have to see what it is . - What 's this ? - I have no idea . Careful , we might have to return it . Oh , god ... Grandpa ! Do you live here or are you visiting someone ? I 'm visiting ... - Are you Beatrice ? - I 'm Beatrice . Help me . My name is Cloette . I 'm here to make you better . You are leaking . The battery is overheated . Clott ! Clott ! She must not see me . - Clott ? Clott ! - Cloette is coming . - Clott , where are you ? - I 'm here . - Did you buy some apricot jam ? - Yes . I 'll come up with jam , tea and toast for Greta . - Is there anyone here ? - No .

So it 's ... a no ? Yes . Or no . I won 't go . All right . I just wondered . All right . By the way ... stupid question , but was there anyone here last night ? No . Okay . Sorry . Will you start him ? It 's just look at him . I need to talk to somebody before we do this . I 'm not sure if I want to . It comes with a 30 minute support call with a dealer . - If I could just ... - When do we start up grandpa ? - We 'll see , honey . - Can we do it now ? - Later . But tonight , then ? Tomorrow ? Yeah ... what the hell were you thinking ? Wait , I 'm not finished . - If you leave the table , you are done . - Not always . What 's up ? Nothing . Tobbe , grandpa is in ... or copy of him ... in the garage . - I know . When should we start him ? - Your mother hasn 't decided . I do not want any tinkering with the ... him ... - Even to start him ? - Yes , yes . Rather no , even that . - You don 't do chores . - I had nothing to do . Sorry . You can help if you want . - I know I do not have to . - I know you know . Mimi , do you want to hang with me at work today ? Do it ! Join us to work ! Come on ! Here . Well ... are you Betty ? - Yes . - They did not say you were a hub . Training is usually done somewhere else . But come ! Here is how much there are on the pallet . Start by checking that it is correct . Here , the total : 48 pieces . - That 's just one . - Yes , one pallet . But it should be 48 pieces of orange crates . - Are you refurbished , or something ? - I do not know . Follow me . Follow me ! Yes , hello . I would like a technical support meeting . No , it 's a clone . Yes , it is an Atsugi . - Are you Inger 's ? - Yes . Are you ... artificial or real ? I 've always wondered . - What are you doing ? - Nothing . You have a meeting . With Claes . Send her to me later ... - Sorry about that . He is a pig . - A what ? He is nasty . I thought you 'll get to watch what I do . - Fun , huh ? - I do not know . When you get below the surface ... - When you understand what it is about ? - Exactly . Right here is a draft contract on a large corporate merger . It is quite complex . I thought you might mark it for typos . - Excuse me ! - By all means . - What is your name , friend ? - Mimi . - She 's with me . - " Calas " ... No . Claes . We can now proceed . I just want you all to realize the significance of the agreement . Be aware of the licenses and lease agreements . There is a related contract . It must be reflected as well ... Be aware of the licenses ... There is a related contract ... Welcome to Atsugi Robotics ! Can you explain in more detail ? When you say daddy 's " personality " is scanned ... how do you mean ? Did you catch his soul , or whatever it is , and install it in a hubot ? By personality we mean the way he moves , his voice and his memories . Pictures were added to his timeline . - He never took a single picture . - Well , when I was little . An exercise program is activated where he associates you with images of you . His voice , movements and memories will be accessed . But these " memories " are just a questionnaire , right ? With a few thousand questions in it . What I really want answered is " why . " Why did he mortgage the house to create a clone ? - Maybe it 's something he told you . - We don 't have that information ... Who are you ? You 're making a mistake . You do not live here . Get out ! This is my room . Excuse me ... excuse me ... Are you drunk ? Are you high ? How can you poison yourself when you have a child ? You 'll see an online video of someone who has succeeded . - Why is this so important ? - How do you think I look ? Yes , it ... is quite good . Do you think I 'm handsome ? Attractive ? I look like a fucking freak . No ... no , then . No woman wants to even look at me without being paid . A hubot ... I want to be young . I want to be a man . Promise not to tell anyone about this . - Not tell ? No , of course . - I have not told anyone . But I look at you as my ... friend . Same here . I 'll recreate it as my father 's partner David Eischer managed to do before he went crazy . Do you think it 's really possible to transfer consciousness into a hubot ? My ... my soul ... or spirit ... will be transferred ... . or transmitted . . Coming from me to my new me . . Oh God . It worked . Honey ? Why didn 't he say he would make a ... clone of himself ? He didn 't know he 'd die so suddenly . And we often do not see him . There honey ... It was something he wanted . Let 's see ! Look at this ... We could have him as a garden gnome . No , sorry ! - You ... - I must sleep . I 'm up early . Sleep well . Clott ! Cloette is coming ! - It was too big ! - Take a big gulp of water . When David comes on Saturday , make beef stew . David will not . He 's dead . Where is this boat going ? Not Alicante again ! I try to do it , but I tremble . I 'm right here . NOISE Now we went aground ! It was just a postal delivery . You should not be up . - I have to find him . - There is only us and Greta . David ... his clone ... After the fire , after her son died ... In the picture ... The older man ... Greta 's son . I have never met her son . You leaks fluid . Be still in landscape mode . - Do you do skin-repair ? - You need Hubmax hubfluid . Give me a pen and paper . That does not help . You need to go to a specialist . Buy it here ! How many hubots are in the apartment ? - Three . - Are you sure ? Affirmative . KNOCK Who is it ? - The Management . - I 'm busy . To stay on account requires personal data . I 'll pay instead . I 'll get you the money . Bye ! PHONE RINGING - Douglas . - Hey , it 's Florentine . I 've been preoccupied , but now I 'm available . So I came back , to try and start anew . Awful ... - What are you doing tonight ? - Tonight ? Tonight , I invited my parents ... my dad to dinner . Oh well . But ... come with ? Sorry , I 'll ... I 'll be ... honest . I really like you . Well , we can go somewhere else tonight . I 've scared you enough ... I 'd love to meet your dad tonight . - Okay . All right . You 're serious ? - Yes . I 'd love to meet your dad . - Have you no mother ? - Yes . She passed away . Two years ago . - She died then ? - Yes . I can not understand you . You 're funny . You are special . And unique . And real . - What are you eating ? - A sandwich . - Can 't we afford real food ? - Yes , but I try to be economical . - Why did you leave that job ? - Got tired . You don 't stop without doing something else . - Don 't you ? - No . Were you fired ? - I stopped . - Was your job taken by a hubot ? - You could say that . - And now we have nothing to eat ! It 's despicable ! - I am eat something ! - You eat shit . - Everything here is now hubot-made . - Move back to your mother , then ! - And stay with her pacman-doll ? - I did not mean it . Sorry . - Since when were you pro-hubot ? - I 'm not anything . Things change . You get used to it . I will get a job soon , I promise . I am looking all the time . I love you . I want your best . I love you too . Do not take the " Real Humans " party too seriously . Focus on school ! Should I just think of myself ? Think about what I said ! Ready for the game ... Then press there . - Set for game ... - More bass : Gaaame ! - Gaaame . - Gaaame ... GAAAME BEGINS ! Then you that flick down . To make a small explosion ... Neat ! Some fanfare ... There we go ! Good ! Cord ! Watch the cord , what the hell ! - Maybe there is something left in the battery . - Or it is totally screwed . - Odi , you have two batteries . - Have I ? All models do . You have the usual , then you have one that keeps you on standby . I should do a hard reboot on you , but you know how it goes . - No . - You 'd lose everything . All memories . You would not remember me or Luther ... - Everything would just disappear ! - But there will be new memories . Yes ... you are right . Fine . There 's something wrong with her . She needs to be rebooted . Huh ? ! Hey , Ma ... tilda . Hey , Be ... tty . - What are we gonna do today ? - Get out ! - You 're not hubot . - What ? Come on ! Stop it ! All right . This is the dumbest thing I have been through . Ever . - You fell for it , right ? - Who pretends to be a hubot ? Just stupid . - A little off , perhaps . - Little ? I know how to do the job . Get the goods , check off and into the shelves . - You talked as if I was an idiot . - But you were an idiot ! - Are you one of those hubbies ? - Absolutely not ! - Could 've fooled me ... - Hubbies use hubots . They use them as sex slaves and what have you . We are transhumans . We are equal with hubots . You 're no better than a hubot . You could say that all are hubots . You are a biohub . Your brain is a chemical computer . That is a common hub , a slavhub . They 're opressed , all these hubots being sold to people . - So you do not own a hubot ? - You can not own a hubot . Wait ... - Do not tell me you have a slavhub ! - She 's not a slave . Seriously ... you can tell it like it is . She really is not a slave . My mom is like you - tolerant . Dad is a bit prehistoric , but he has nothing to say . My little sister thinks that hubots are from hubotland . My brother is transhuman sexual ( THS ) . Are you sure he 's just not good at getting girls ? No , he is THS . Though he does not really talk about it , so forget it . Welcome ! Tobbe ! Hello ! We thought about making tea . Want one ? Yes . Hey ! Hey . My name is Betty . Tobbe . - Is Tobbe your nickname ? - Yes . Earl gray or rooibos ? Rooibos . Betty is a hubot from work . She had to come home with me today . All right . I 'll just go to the bathroom . - So you may leave the store ? - Yes . If an employee takes responsibility . We have a new social software . It gets better when we interact with people . You have a really nice home . Thank you . You also seem very nice , Tobbe . Same to you . Do you have a girlfriend , Tobbe ? I have to get her back to the store before they close . - What are you talking about ? - I asked if Tobbe had a girlfriend . Betty , you flirt ! - Wait , Tobbe ... - F * * * you ! Take it easy . The enemy surrounds us . - 24 Points ! What did you get ? - 15 . I got 11 . Hey . Welcome to the Hub Battle Land . Did you work before ? And what did you do ? I was a floor layer for 20 years . Then I was a foreman in a warehouse until now . - Foreman ? You are there now ? - No , I 've stopped . - What ? Voluntary ? And now ... ? - I wanted to try something new . What do you like about this place , then ? It looks ... stimulating . EXPLOSION Hi-hi-hi ... Have you worked with hubots before ? Yes , a lot . At the warehouse were many . - You will not be foreman here . - I get it . Got a problem with what people might say about working here ? - It 's only normal . - What ? What is ? What is normal ? Everyone has opinions about everything . Including this job . Not everyone likes it . - Is this place yours ? - I 'm a partner . The job begins today . If you can . Otherwise tomorrow . What do you say ? Have I got the job ? I start at once ! Why complicate things unnecessarily ? Come , I 'll show you . EXPLOSION Odi : Hi-hi-hi ... Here are the last ones . Take this . Point and press . Try it . Sunday is pure paintball . Mixed teams with seven members . Come on ! We call it a blacklist , but it 's nothing illegal . Some say that it is illegal but conspiracy or incitement must contain some form of call to action . We only list companies that use hubots instead of humans . One place , Hub Battle Land ... Should we joint it ? Men shoot at hubots . That can hardly be a job for humans . The company that kicked my dad ... - Keep going , keep going ! - Kevin ?

They are transhuman . Did you tell her I 'm THS ? Did you ? - Yes . - It 's private ! - I want to decide who gets to know . - But ... she 's one of those . - She is not THS . - She 's cool with that kind of stuff . I said it because I wanted her to know that we are similar . Okay , sorry . Did she think I would hit on her ? - Admit that you went for it ! - That question is the worst insult . I am proud that you are THS . It is cool . - That 's not cool . - But it 's ... different . Do not try to fix me up with hubots . Especially not fakers . And I don 't flirt with anything that runs on batteries . He 's not just your dad . He is the children 's grandpa and my father in law also . And ? - Well , should we not ... ? Start him up ?

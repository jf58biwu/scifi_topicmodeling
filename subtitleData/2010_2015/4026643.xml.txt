What seemed to be a very simple task has taken the most perplexing of turns . So I 'm gonna speak slowly , clearly , so my message is not lost , or ignored , or misinterpreted . One million dollars to the man who kills Carl Lucas . This offer expires in 48 hours , and if that happens , I will consider you all enemies , and I will bring war on your fucking head . Understand ? SEPTEMBER : Ninety percent of Terminal Island , your grand investment , is dead space . Death Match merely stayed your execution . If you wanna get a breath of fresh air , you need a bold initiative . I propose 3 race . Wicked . Epic . Something like no one has ever seen before . The track will run the length of Terminal Island along some of the narrowest and most harrowing paths that the racing world has to offer . The best part of it , everything that we need is right in our own backyard . We 're gonna modify each vehicle , adding reinforced steel plating , bulletproof glass , and roll cages to at least give the drivers a fighting chance . We 'll take everything that made Death Match a hit , combine it with everything we have at our disposal . Such as ? Heavy fucking artillery . ( EXCLAIMS ) SEPTEMBER : Every car will hold as many guns and as much ammunition as it can , ( LAUGHING ) So , you 're going to arm the prisoners . Precautions will be made to make sure they can only shoot at people on the track . Nine cars , three days , 20,000 rounds of ammunition . Going from righting to racing , that 's a big leap . We need a hook . Something that incorporates the two better . Now , in a game show , no one cares about the game . The game 's arbitrary . People care about the risk and the money . Now , we 've been concentrating on the game , not the risk . That 's why our audience is bored . Let 's concentrate on the prize . A prize more valuable than money . Okay . What 's more valuable than money ? Life is a more valuable prize than money . In our deal with the state , we control sentencing . That means we control their life . So if a prisoner wins five races , he gets his freedom . No matter what he 's in for , robbery , rape , homicide , whatever , he wins his freedom . He wins his life . You have life , freedom . Stop . Death Race . LUKE : You know what ? That 's fucking bullshit , Rocco . Well , how do you know , man ? Maybe ifs for real . Are you kidding me ? You think they 're gonna let murderers and rapists out of this place , ever ' ? Hey , Luke 's right . And besides that , homes , you don 't drive worth a shit . ROCCO : You know what ?

( LAUGHING ) Okay , what did I do ' ? You won ! To the victor belongs the spoils . Okay , so what does that mean ' ? What is this ? In ancient Rome , the winning gladiator was the recipient of gifts . A show of gratitude from the powers that be for a job well done . She 's yours . Mmm-hmm . Do with her what you please . ( LAUGHS ) Is that right ? And who the fuck are you ? I 'm Caesar . You know , they 're probably watching . Mmm-hmm . Listening , too , I guess . Some kind of game they 're playing . Yeah , probably betting on what we 'll do next . Option A , they 're trying to get us closer so they can use one of us against the other . Uh-huh . Option B being , maybe , put a wedge between us , so we fuck up on the track ? I guess we do what they want , and leave the bullshit for later . You playing me ? Does it matter ? No . ( GIGGLES ) ( GRUNTING ) ( PANTING ) Kane put a million-dollar bounty on Lucas , and all the bangers are going for it . Put Mr. Lucas in solitary . I thought this was a prison thing , but this is too big for even the guards to resist . - You still gonna let him race ? - Oh , yeah . They 're free to kill him on the track , just not off camera . What about him ? Wait ! Wait ! Come on . Let 's go . You had your fun . Move . - KATRINA : Where are we going ? - Shut up . KATRINA : What the fuck is this ? Beautiful view of freedom from here , Katrina . KATRINA : Okay . But who are you ? You 're much more attractive in person . I 'm flattered . What do you want ? Carl Lucas . I want him dead . And in return , I offer you freedom . A chance of life outside these walls for one simple task . You 've got 48 hours . You kill him or I kill you . Let me make these walls disappear .

Warden Parks , we 're hereto escort you from the premises . " Whosoever diggeth a pit shall fall therein . " Proverb 26 : 27 . Is that supposed to be deep ? Hopefully deep enough that , when you fall , you 'll break your fucking neck . ( KNOCKING ) - What do you want ? - Time to race . GOLDBERG : You got a big fucking bulls-eye on your back Luke .

Thankfully all his vitals have stabilised but he should be moved to a facility more suited to his needs . SEPTEMBER : Out of the question . Doctor someone from the outside tried to kill him . Unless they think he 's dead , they 'll come back to finish the job . Yeah , well , I can 't pronounce a man dead while he 's still alive . Can 't you ? ( MONITOR FLATLINING ) WEYLAND : How are we doing with finding a replacement for Parks ? She comes highly recommended from Halliburton . She ran their maximum security detention centre . She 's strong . She 's smart . Ruthlessly ambitious . I think if I weren 't around , she 'd tell people that Death Race was her idea and she 'd convince them that it was . How 's the switchover to the Internet ? Transitions complete . We start streaming live worldwide tomorrow . The numbers have already surpassed pay-per-view , thanks to the Frankenstein commercial . Hold on . Wait . I 've been meaning to talk to you about this Frankenstein . Did you make him up ? Frankenstein most certainly exists , and he will be in the race tomorrow . He better be . And he better come as good as advertised . DOCTOR : The procedure 's experimental and dangerous . We 're talking about placing electrodes into the brain . SEPTEMBER : You told me he was a perfect candidate . DOCTOR : Oh , he is . But there are no guarantees . SEPTEMBER : Let 's wake him up . DOCTOR : Mn Lucas . You 've got second-degree burns over 85 % of your body . Now you 're lucky that you suffered no significant injuries . Not a broken bone or damaged organ , which is remarkable considering the intensity of the fire . LUKE : So , this is hell ? SEPTEMBER : Why ? LUKE : Where else would you be ? SEPTEMBER : You do remember me . You win five races and you 're free . LUKE : You 're out of your fucking mind . SEPTEMBER : No more Markus Kane trying to track you down . Like a second chance . Look at me . Really . Look at me . What kind of second chance would I have ? SEPTEMBER : You 're either Frankenstein or you 're nobody . You 're certainly not Carl Lucas any more . The entire world watched him incinerate . There 's even a death certificate . LUKE : I pity you . SEPTEMBER : Okay If you don 't do it for your life , then you do it for Katrina . I 'll furlough five of my worst sodomites for a play date with sweet Katrina . By the time they 're finished with hen she 'll be lucky if she has a pulse . How do you feel , Mr. Lucas ? The name is Frankenstein . ( CAR ENGINE REWING ) Sorry 10 disappoint you . You 're gonna have to settle for the Mexican Jew , Three , two , one , and were in .

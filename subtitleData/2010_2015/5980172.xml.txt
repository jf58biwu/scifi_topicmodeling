 MOLLY : I went to space on a 13-month solo mission . I didn 't come home alone . My husband created a lifelike android called a Humanich . His name is Ethan . He 's the prototype . This is a story about Earth . Ethan ! A story about family . A story about surviving . NARRATOR : Previously on Extant : COMPUTER : Beginning playback . Where is Molly ? You haven 't the faintest idea what you 've put in motion with your little stunt . Concealing Molly 's pregnancy , destroying her blood sample . You sent her a text , " Get out of the car . " - I 'm not saying another word . - You 'll probably wanna talk . Your brother , you did an exemplary job of covering up his past . Just leave my brother out of this . This is a situation of your own making , Sam , and one that only you have the power to change . What do you want me to do ? [ BARKING ] What 's going on , boy ? Ah ! He bit me ! QUINN : Put that on the bite . - Okay , thanks . I don 't want anything to jeopardize our work or him . This is much more than my work now . It 's my family . MOLLY : Ethan ! [ WHIRRING ] [ GRUNTS ] Ethan ! Come on , baby . Come on . [ AIR HISSING ] MARCUS : What a crazy night . I didn 't get any rest . I ... I feel so muddle-headed . Marcus ? Were you expecting someone else ? Your hair looks pretty . Hey , have you seen my red duffel bag ? [ BUZZER SOUNDS ] Molly ? What do you want it for ? I 'm sorry , maybe I just have baby brain-drain . Re-entry training in the Sims . It 's the last one . But it 's a dangerous drive down the Cape in the rain . It 's a beautiful day . No , please , don 't go . - I 'm coming with you . - Okay . I really wish you 'd turn the auto-drive back on . I feel better if I 'm in control . They never let me turn the autopilot off on the Sims unless we 're literally a million miles away from docking . Why don 't you take a nap ? Wear the restraints . I 've got my seat belt on . The other ones . What are these ? [ HORN HONKING ] [ GASPING ] ETHAN : Mom ? Are you okay ? I kept your secret . [ BABY CRYING ] The baby needs you . [ GASPS ] [ DOGS BARKING AND PEOPLE YELLING ] Molly ! Molly ! Molly ! Over here ! I found them ! Call an ambulance ! MAN : Get an ambulance now ! JOHN : She 's three months pregnant . - We 'll check her in transit . JOHN : Please , do it now . Rus , I 'm not getting anything . JOHN : Excuse me . FEMALE EMT : Sir , you can 't move him ! Oh , Ethan . Help my wife . Check the baby . I can 't get a fetal heartbeat . Let 's go . Let 's go . - John . MALE EMT : Give us a hand . - What happened ? - She 's unconscious . We 're going back to the mainland . I called for an airlift . - What 's happened ? - I 'll let you know as soon as I know , okay ? [ SIREN WAILING ] [ COUPLE PANTING ] We 're not gonna hang out and get breakfast , are we ? No . I mean , thanks . You know what I mean . Good times . [ WHIRRING ] [ WHIRRING ] Play messages , last to first . CHARLIE : They just touched down at Medplex Metro ahead of schedule . Maybe I 've mentioned this a thousand times already , but it 'd be amazing if you 'd call me back . I just talked to John at the island . Ethan 's shut down at the core . Molly 's hurt . They 're flying them in to Medplex Metro . Call me back , Jules . - John , where am I ? JOHN : It 's okay . - You 're safe . You 're waking up . BECK : Offshore airlift . Hypothermia from exposure , concussion , loss of consciousness . You 're in a hospital . You were unconscious from a fall . - Where 's Ethan ? - Ethan is safe . Mrs. Woods , do you know what day it is ? Uh ... Monday . What about the baby ? BECK : How many weeks ? MOLLY : Fifteen . Oh , God . Did something happen to my baby ? Have you experienced any bleeding or cramping - in the past 10 days to two weeks ? - No . John , they took me somewhere . And they did something to me . NURSE : No , no , no . - Yes , they did , John . We 're gonna sedate you , Mrs. Woods , and get you checked out . Nuller . - Is that really necessary ? NURSE : Just try and relax . You need to stay out here , sir . Come on . DAVIS : Load it up . Two minutes till we 're ready . Then we 'll roll out , I guess . [ INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT OVER PA ] JOHN : Julie ? I tried to reach you . There is no change . - My phone 's bugging out . Charlie ... - The shutdown is at the root . Is Molly okay ? Ethan must have sensed a catastrophic event during the fall , and shut himself down . There 's a chance his system integrity is interrupted , but his core is still active . He 'll be okay . - What were they doing in the woods ? - Ethan got separated . How ? I 'll dock him and run the diagnosis crawler . - And then a restart . - Yeah . Oh , he 's so cold . It 's the warmers . They don 't draw power . I know why he 's cold . It 's just ... It 's just strange . - Molly will be waking up soon . - I 'll get him back . - Hi . - Hi . - Did they Nuller me ? - Yeah , I 'm afraid so . - Yeah . - Julie took Ethan . She 's gonna check him out and reinitialize . She 's gonna wake him up ? Yeah , wake him up . He 's in good hands . - John ... - Hm ? [ MONITOR CHIMES ] Hello , I 'm Dr. Gavin Beck , and I 'll be with you in just a moment to discuss any questions or concerns you might have about your ... I 'd like to keep you overnight for observation . The nanobiotics should prevent any complications from the lacerations , but the concussion deserves a 12-hour hold . - My baby ? - Did we lose it ? Your HCG is baseline , your uterus shows no sign of any implantation , let alone a recent miscarriage . - I don 't understand . - There was no pregnancy . What ? Your body has not been pregnant in the recent past . Are you sure you have the right patient ? Woods ? Molly Woods ? - I wanna see myself . - We 're very busy today . Well , I need to see it . It 's a healthy uterus , but there 's no fetus there . Okay ? Well , that 's impossible . They 'll be by soon to move you upstairs . Medplex cares about the quality of treatment you received today . The following short assessment will help us to better serve you . - You 're not allowed in here . - There were blood tests , a scan . - The baby was fact , not fiction . - Mr. Woods ... I 'm just simply suggesting that there must be some kind of a problem - with your machines . - Did you see the scan yourself ? Or do you know your wife was pregnant because she told you she was ? If I were you , I might begin looking at this as a psychological issue , not a physiological one . You can 't be in here . Where are you ? What the hell happened ? I 'm okay , Daddy . They , um ... You know , patched me up pretty good . I 've been holding my breath . Thank God you 're all right , baby girl . What about Ethan ? Please , tell me he 's not hurt bad . John 's gonna run some tests on him , but it looks like he 's gonna be okay . If I 'd only known he was gonna run ... I know , Daddy , it 's okay . I need your help right now , though . John and I ran some tests on one of my old genetics setups . It should have processed a result by now . - No , I already shut that thing down . - Before it finished ? No , no , there was a readout that said there was an error with the samples . Do you have another ? I gotta go , Daddy . Are you sure you 're all right ? Yeah . What ? He said I was crazy ? Okay , right . Well , we gotta get out of here . MOLLY : I know what they did . They took it out of me . And now they 're covering it up . The ISEA did this . Sparks admitted to doing all kinds of secret experiments , right ? Well , maybe they did all of this to take the baby . What , you got a better explanation ? Molly , I 'm on your side , but nothing makes sense . I was missing for six hours , you know . I know , but there is no pregnancy hormones . Did they just abort the baby and give you a full blood transfusion ? - They wouldn 't have had time . - They have resources . They did this , and they 're covering it up . Ethan may remember what happened when he wakes up . Sam . She knows I was pregnant . She saw the scan , she performed it . - Change destination , please . COMPUTER : Changing destination . How is it our little man only has class-one tears to his skin , but his neural net is freaking nuked ? Something scared him , and he pulled all his systems down . It was self-preservation . Yeah , he turtled , for sure , but why , lady ? Why ? I love that his skin just tears in straight lines . That 's nice work . Sorry . I just don 't understand how John could 've exposed him to this kind of risk . Ethan got lost in the woods . It could 've happened to any kid . It 's not any kid . All right , the crawler 's done . All right , let 's reboot this puppy . Remember when we actually built a puppy , and I said that ? Yeah . [ CHARLIE CLEARS THROAT AND JULIE SIGHS ] Say a prayer . [ MACHINE WHIRRING THEN THUDS ] CHARLIE : There 's still damage at the core . This is gonna take a while . How did it make the trip ? Our concerns about keeping it alive outside of the mother won 't be an issue . It 's surviving . It 's thriving . COMPUTER : Have a nice day . - Don 't go anywhere . - Understood . Still no answer . The door is open . Keep it that way . [ RINGS DOORBELL ] [ SIGHS ] [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] - Hey , Molly . - Sam , thank God . What 's going on ? Hey , John . Come on in . I have been calling you and calling you . I can see that . What on earth is wrong ? - Has anyone been in touch with you ? - About what ? Why do you have cuts on your hand ? John and I went to see my dad on the island . We were gonna do a test ourselves , but they followed us there . - Who did ? - Sparks . He 's behind the whole thing . You so saved me , Sam . - Molly , did you get an IV ? - We just left the hospital . Molly blacked out . We were looking for Ethan . They took the baby out of my body . I woke up this morning , and the baby was gone . They 're covering their tracks . What baby ? Do you mean Ethan ? The pregnancy ? Are you pregnant ? No , Molly , that 's not even possible . Wait , you honestly don 't know what we 're talking about ? I mean , you discovered it . You did the scan . What scan ? I ... - Are who listening ? - Oh , come on . Molly , what were they treating you for at the hospital ? Was it a blackout , a head injury ? Okay , are we really gonna play this game ? I 'm not playing any game . I 'm trying to react to you as a friend ... No , as a friend , you told me to get out of that car . JOHN : You called me after the party , and I said she 'd gone to the ISEA with Sparks . - And you sounded worried . - I was worried . You were acting so strange that night . The text is gone . They erased it . Honestly , I don 't ... What do you want me to say ? - What do they have on you , huh ? - Molly , if there 's any part of you that trusts me right now , please , go back to the hospital . They better have a gun to your head . SAM : John . I 'm so sorry . But something happened to her up there . She 's right to be paranoid . But it 's a brain issue . She needs to be seen . Take her far away from whatever it is she 's suspicious of , but , please , just get her some help , please . They got to her . They 're trying to make me look crazy . [ PHONE RINGING ] Hello ? - We 'll be right there . - What ? It 's Ethan . Something 's wrong . He 's not waking up . Yasumoto Towers . Whatever caused him to shut down was catastrophic . His systems are trying to rebuild everything he is from scratch . He 's still in there . I know he is . Is there anything we can do ? Well , it 's not as simple as reloading a backup . Ethan 's complexity has out-paced our ability to repair him . We could try forcing an engagement with his body to speed up the process ... No , interfering could be disastrous . Even when we 've modeled a flawless restart , there 's still potential for cognitive and memory loss . He might not be who he was before he shut down . So basically he 's in a coma ? JULIE : Basically . All we can do is wait . [ SIGHS ] I want someone by his side 24 / 7 . Really ? But he 's not even gonna know we 're here . We 'll know . Ethan 's hurt because of me . They used him to lure me out of the house . Who knows what happened ? We have to get inside the ISEA . It 's the only way we 're gonna get any answers . - Hey , well , if you don 't believe me ... - Hey , I ... I don 't know what I believe . That 's the truth . I know something happened to you on the mission because you came back changed . I know you believe you were pregnant ... No , I was pregnant . We spent years trying to have this baby . We wanted it so badly . So , I ... ? What , I saw what I wanted to see ? - No ... - All of it ? You were alone with Sam during the test . I wasn 't with you when she warned you about Sparks . Everything I know about this pregnancy , I know from you . And we both know you 've been hallucinating . I know when I 'm hallucinating , okay ? I 've had a lot of practice lately . I 'm not saying it wasn 't real to you . I am not imagining a baby . Listen , it doesn 't matter if I believe you or not , but if I 'm not sure it happened , then I guarantee you the rest of the world will be certain it didn 't . Okay . You let me know if anything changes with Ethan . Molly , where are you going ? It does matter , John , if you believe me . His program architecture is resilient . He 's strong . He gets it from us . He gets it from Molly too . - Can I take a shift ? - Soon . What happened out in those woods ? I don 't know . I guess we 'll find out when he wakes up . [ ALARM BLARING ] John ? - What are you doing ? - Trying something . - His systems are ready . - You can 't engage his body yet . He needs some kind of stimulus . - He needs to know we 're here . - It 's too soon . Ethan ? Do you hear me ? - [ IN HOARSE VOICE ] Who are you ? - It 's me , Dad . Who are you ? Who are you ? Who are you ? Who are you ? COMPUTER : Shutting down . - How could you do that ? - It 's just as risky to do nothing . So that was ... That was good ? The truth is Ethan is in an undiscovered country right now . Neither of us knows what 's going on there . The truth ? How about you wanna find out what Ethan knows about what happened to Molly ? I do , but I didn 't put him at risk . Taking him to the island put him at risk . You didn 't even tell me you were going . We built him together , John . From coding to body-mapping , through every stage of development . And then every big decision that needs to be made , you just make it . Did I need your permission to take him to see his grandfather ? That 's not what I 'm talking about . We were gonna find the best home for Ethan . We were auditioning families when you just took him home . - But you never objected . - What was I gonna say ? " I know you guys can 't have kids of your own , but I think it 'd be better for Ethan to be with someone else " ? I 'm not saying he 's in the wrong place . I know Ethan wouldn 't be who he is without you . But you 're not his parent . And I don 't need your permission to make any decisions here . You work for me . We 're not partners . [ DOOR CLOSES ] How 's Ethan ? I don 't know . I was impatient . I tried to rush things . He 's back to where he was . Molly , I want to believe . If you can just help me see how can all of this be true . Okay , I can 't . Something terrible happened to me , unthinkable , and I don 't have proof . Now , I know that 's hard for you . You need a leap of faith . Yeah . But if I take the leap and I 'm wrong ... And I 'm crazy ? [ SCOFFS ] Nothing would make me happier right now than to be crazy . [ CHUCKLES ] I can 't lose you . Please , don 't give up on facts now . The only chance I 've got is to keep fighting from the inside . But why would they keep you around ? Well , because they think they 've neutralized the threat . Sam was the only one who had proof of the baby on that blood test . And they tied her up pretty good . They covered up everything . Everything they knew about . The dog . - Remember Gus ? - Yeah . He bit me . Sparks doesn 't know about that . JOHN : Yeah . MOLLY : I gotta go call my dad . Thank you , Daddy . Baby girl . Hey . What the hell do you want with a bloody towel ? - See you at 4 . - Okay . Dr. Beck , do you have a moment ? John Woods . You treated my wife Molly . BECK : Yes ? I just wanted to apologize for my behavior yesterday . I had no right to come after you that way . There 's no need . I see you didn 't stay the night , like I asked . Well , she was panicking , and I felt it was better for her to be home . Sorry . As long as her symptoms didn 't get any worse . But you were right . I was seeing what I wanted to see . - We all do that . If you 'll excuse me . - Yeah . But she 's getting worse . Now that you 've opened my eyes , I realize she 's been living in this fantasy world for quite some time . I 'll have my office give you contact information . There are also at-home therapy options , if you don 't mind a simulant . - Now , I really need to be going . - Oh , a simulant ? BECK : An artificially-generated therapy option . - The units are excellent . JOHN : A robot therapist ? I don 't know that I 'd trust that kind of thing helping my wife . Do they work ? BECK : Just get in touch with my office . - Come on . Sorry , I just want to thank you again . And did you ... ? Did you give me your contact information ? You know , I 'll let you escape now . Thanks for all the help . [ DOOR CLOSES ] MOLLY : This proves it . They tried to make me think I was crazy . There was a baby . But why admit to getting you pregnant , and then cover it up ? I don 't know , but this blood analysis shows that it was part me , and this other DNA , well , I 've never seen anything like it . So , what Sparks was saying about me being the father , that 's ... I 'm sorry . I believed him when he said it was ours . But I 've gotta find out what they did to me . You said it yourself , the only way is from the inside . Yeah , so I 've gotta get myself back to work , pretend I believe their story , act crazy and confused , and chalk it all up to a bad re-entry . Act like you believe it , and they will too . We can 't trust anybody , John . Not Sam , not anybody . No , but we can trust each other . [ TALKING INDISTINCTLY ] - Do you think ... ? - Been worried about you . They told me that you were admitted to a hospital after an airlift this morning . I had to get away , okay ? I panicked . - I 'm sorry . - You could 've killed us both . - I was trying to help you , Molly . - Help me . You saved my life . It was crazy of me thinking I was pregnant . I 'm embarrassed that I lost touch with reality like that . It 's painful to see someone you love not act like themselves . Yeah , well , I scared everybody I loved , okay ? Even myself . I need another chance . I wanna come back to work . I 'm not Kryger . No , you 're not . He wasn 't as strong as you . But I suggest you take some time , think about this . No , I worked too hard for everything I 've got . I don 't wanna lose that now . All right . We 're all here to help you get healthy , Molly . But I won 't lie to you . Given your condition , we 'll be watching you very carefully . I 'd expect that . I 'm not gonna let you down . Welcome back . Thank you . I know you 're there . You smell better than anyone else in this building . [ BOTH CHUCKLE ] Well , that 's not saying much . You know , you should go away more often . While you were gone , I found out that you were wrong about two things . First , that sales rep was trying to seduce me . - I wasn 't imagining it . - I 'm happy for you , Danny . I 'm sure it had nothing to do with that centrifuge he was trying to sell . DANNY : You know what ? Promise me . When our research makes a deep-space colony viable , I get to go first , by myself . MOLLY : You don 't mind , do you ? DANNY : Mind ? I 've been hanging out with our dead worms . [ UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ] DANNY [ MUFFLED ] : Speaking of which ... [ DIALOGUE MUFFLED BY MUSIC ] This is the cam from the deep-space probe as it was returning to the Seraphim on your mission . - So this was about ... - Sixty-four hundred miles up , where all the worms died , right there . I was looking at that , but I couldn 't find anything . Neither could I , which only leaves one possibility . You messed up and contaminated the samples before the probe left the station . MOLLY : Right . - No , wrong . You don 't mess up . Hey , do you wanna do this another time ? No , no , go . Well , I kept at it , and then I discovered this . - Oh , a new filter . - Mm . I called it Algorithm Danny 5 . But here , here , here , watch . Right at 6,392 miles out . It 's a wave of interlaced energy fields . I mean , it oscillates so fast , no single frequency shows up . That 's why we never found it . I 've never seen anything like it . So it moves like energy , but it contaminates . More like a spore . What is it ? Where did it come from ? I don 't know . Looks like you found our worm killer . [ CELL PHONE RINGS ] Hey , John . Ethan ? When ? I 'm on my way . He did it on his own . Julie noticed it first . Twenty minutes ago , everything just comes back up . - He 's asleep , but he 's in there . - He 's smiling . Wouldn 't you ? Ethan . Hey , Ethan . Hey . Mom . Welcome back . We missed you . Time to go home . I 'm so tired . Well , Dad said it 's gonna take some time to feel all better . A lot of rest . Okay . I was so scared when you were gone . Do you remember what happened ? Anything ? No . - Can I get a drink ? - No , no , no . You stay right here . I 'll do that . Don 't get used to this kind of treatment . Were you expecting someone else ? [ GASPING ] Where did it come from ? Hey , boss . I 'm just leaving . Hey , Danny , can you send me the new algorithm ? Your file ? Yeah , but you 're not gonna guilt me into staying late . Heh . No guilt . Okay . There you go . Thank you . Here . Okay . Load file . Index day 307 , hour 14 . - Is this ? - Yeah . When I saw Marcus . Pause . Insert filter , Algorithm Danny 5 . Index , play . The transfer to the life support cell is complete . All vitals are strong . What the hell is it ? It 's a boy . [ MACHINE BEEPING AND AIR HISSING ]

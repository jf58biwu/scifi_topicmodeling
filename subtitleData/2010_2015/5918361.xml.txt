 Previously on " the 100 " ... [ all cough ] Dante : Welcome to mount weather . [ grunts ] So we meet again . Jasper : Clarke , no ! If you pull that lever , These people will die . Even a little radiation could kill them . It was a containment breach . Help ! Your circulatory systems developed the ability to filter radiation . If we were to circulate maya 's blood through your system ... Jasper : It could make her better ? The first human trial was a success . Why bring them here , if not to use them ? I saw everything . I know what you 're doing to them . [ grunts ] We have to get them out . We gather intel on mount weather And we send a team after kane . Where 's finn ? Looking for you . Where is the girl who was wearing this watch ? ! [ gunshot ] Your friends are not here . [ shouting and automatic gunfire ] We need to go ! Finn ! [ people screaming ] I found you . Bellamy : Ok , tell me again . Clarke : It 's a labyrinth . We got to the dam through this tunnel . It 's all connected to the mine system . That 's our way in . Sure , if we can get past the reapers and the mountain men . I swear to god , if your mom doesn 't Sanction a mission soon , i 'm going by myself . You won 't be by yourself . [ distant chatter ] Guess the inquisition 's over . How 's finn doing , anyway ? I haven 't talked to him since we got back . I don 't know what to say . He just kept shooting . We 're at war , clarke . We 've all done things . Finn : Hey . Hey . Next round 's on me . Mount weather ? What 's the plan ? Still working on it . Murphy : Ah ! Check it out . Salvaged monty 's still from the drop ship . Now , i guess , you know , if they could just salvage monty , huh ? Easy . It was just a joke . Ok . You , uh , tell her we were cleared ? No . Well , it looks like our pardon For surviving includes our time on the ground . Now bigger fish to fry , i guess . We did what we had to do . I got to go . [ murphy whistles ] trouble in paradise ? Just because they pardoned you doesn 't mean i have . Clarke . Beat it , murphy . Well , then , have a good one . I know why we haven 't heard From any of the other ark stations . Mount weather 's jamming us . Show me . I tweaked the resonator and got this . [ muffled static ] It 's on every frequency . Long-range communication is totally screwed . It 's also why the range in our walkies sucks . It 's the same signal monty heard On the black box of the exodus ship . Mount weather crashed the exodus ship . Can you get around the signal ? Around it ? No . But if i can get to the tower that broadcasts it , I can make it go boom . Abby : No one is going anywhere . Mom , listen to me- - what do i have to do to get through to you ? You and your friends are not soldiers , And continuing to act like you are Puts lives at risk . You don 't understand . Raven found something . Mount weather is jamming our communications . Raven : It 's true . There could be other ark stations on the ground . And more guards . You said we don 't have enough people To fight a two-front war . Mom , we 're already fighting one . Byrne : The grounder retaliation for the massacre could Happen at any time , and when it does , we need Every available man to defend this camp . So let us go . You 're not gonna stop , are you ? Not until my friends are safe . Ok . But i 'm coming with you . Byrne : Ma 'am , i just said- - It 's been quiet for two days . Maybe kane is making headway with the grounders ' commander . Or maybe he 's dead , and they 're massing against us as we speak . Maybe ... Which is why we need more guards . Then it 's settled . We 're going back to mount weather . Sir , it 's been 3 days And maya 's numbers are still climbing . Tsing : It 's too soon to be sure , but i believe She may actually be metabolizing radiation on her own now . Jasper 's blood was 8 times more effective Than any outsider we 've ever measured . I 'm still running tests , but his system Appears to have jump-started hers . Cage : You 're saying that it 's a permanent solution ? Maya can survive on the ground ? I 'm saying it 's possible . I 'll keep watching her . In the meantime , sir , you have to let me Move forward with the rest of the 47 . No . Dad , i--i agree with her . I know that the plan was to Assimilate them into the gene pool , But this changes everything . She just said it 's not proven . Tsing : Mr. President , Even if it 's not a permanent solution , With their blood , We 'll need fewer treatments , we 'll live longer , And we 'll feel better . Jasper volunteered . I will not put those kids in cages Like animals . Cage : No one wants that . If you can convince the rest of them to volunteer , Great , but what if you can 't ? Every day , you paint the outside , And if dr . Tsing is right about this , Then you might be able to see it again , dad . Listen to me . You need to understand this . If i give the order to harvest those kids , I won 't deserve to see it again . Where are you going ? To find you some volunteers . [ door opens ] Ahem . He 'll come around . What if he doesn 't ? What if they don 't volunteer ? Then we 'll have to do it anyway . Octavia : I can 't believe they let finn come . He 's the best tracker we 've got . Don 't forget to look up . The grounders use the trees . That 's how we lost john mbege . You were right to have me bring them . Don 't worry . Your guards will get there . I know you 're worried about finn . Thank you for voting to clear him . Thought he was rescuing his friends . The real question is , is he going to be able to clear himself ? [ grunting ] Kane , stop . If they wanted to kill us , They would have done it already . Oh , two days without food or water . Jaha : Come on . How many times on the ark did we go Two days without water ? This ... This is not how our story ends , marcus . We wind up in the same train station On the ground Just to die in it ? We still got work to do . [ scoffs ] how can you be so sure ? [ whispers ] my son told me . Kane : Stop ! We came in peace . We came in peace ! Please ! [ jaha panting ] You speak of peace While you send an assassin into one of my villages . What are you talking about ? Blood ... Must have blood . One of you will die Here , today , by the other 's hand . I will hear the terms of your surrender From the man who lives . [ door clangs shut ] They want us to turn on each other . Woman : They want justice . Lives have been lost on both sides . That 's why we need to end this war ! What 's your name ? Lexa . Lexa . I 'm thelonious ... And this is marcus . Your commander spoke of An assassin in a village ? Yes . Eighteen of our people were murdered . Elders ... Children . We have nothing to do with that . It doesn 't matter . The commander thinks you did . One of you must pick up the knife . That is our way . And if we refuse ? Then the commander will use it to slit both of your throats . Jasper . I 'd hoped to catch you Before you were discharged . I see i 'm not the only one impressed by your courage . Oh , i just did what anyone would do . I 'd like to believe that 's true . May i walk with you ? Sure . After what happened to maya , I 'm sure it won 't come as a surprise to you To learn that we 're not entirely safe here . Mount weather wasn 't built to last this long . Over time , trace amounts of radiation seep inside . The breach in the dorm is an extreme example . We have methods for dealing with this , But frankly , those methods pale Compared to what we saw with you and maya . Sir , i- - I don 't think i could do that for everyone . Of course not , but if you could Inspire your friends to follow your example , Imagine the difference you could make here . There . I see it . Here . It 'll be dark soon . We 'll never spot the traps . We should set up camp here , leave at first light . We 're missing two . Where the hell are they ? Man : Bellamy ! Octavia ! Clarke , we 're in enemy territory , And their lives are my responsibility . They went to find a way in . A way in . That 's not what this mission is about . It is for them . Find them . Bring them back . Yes , ma 'am . You two with me . Let 's go . I 'm going with them . Finn , wait . We need you here . Why ? So you can keep an eye on me ? You 'd have to be able to look at me to do that . Finn- - What do you think i 'm gonna do ? Clarke : Finn . Clarke : I 'll go get him . Finn ! Come back . It was an accident . [ distant explosion ] What was that ? [ animals screeching ] Run ! Acid fog ! Take cover ! If you can hear me , use the tents ! My tent ! I forgot my pack ! It 's ok ! We can make it to the bunker ! According to clarke , before the bombs , There were buildings everywhere here . I 'm guessing some of them had access to the bunker . So we 're looking for ruins , Anything that 's manmade , ok ? Scott : Hey ! Blake ! Let 's go , right now . In case you 've forgotten , We 're not under your command . Don 't make us do this the hard way . Come on , scott , 47 of our people Are prisoners in this mountain . And that 's why we 're out here . Wrong . You 're out here to find other stations of the ark . We 're out here to find our friends . Bell . What are they doing ? [ distant screeching ] Bellamy : Running . Acid fog ! We need cover ! Now ! Deploy the tents ! Let 's go ! [ bellamy grunts ] Man : Yeah , i got it . Let 's get all the canvas out now . Bellamy : O ! O ! Get back here ! Octavia : Bell ! There 's something in here . Maybe it 's the ruins . Hey ! Hey ! Over here ! Let 's go ! Come on ! Come on ! Octavia : I found it ! Bellamy : Come on , pull . Hurry up ! [ grunts ] Bellamy : Hey ! Quick ! Get inside ! Come on , move ! Let 's go ! [ whimpering ] Bellamy : Move ! It 's too late ! [ coughing ] Finn : You ok ? Yeah , i 'm ok . I 'm ok . Abby on radio : Clarke ? Clarke , do you read me ? [ radio static ] Raven : We 're closer to the source . It 's swallowing short-range now , too . Clarke , do you read me ? Damn it ! Clarke and finn know these woods . She left her pack , and her tent is in it . They 'll find shelter . [ signal sputtering ] [ garbled voices speaking ] What is that ? I don 't know . It sounds like they 're jamming every frequency but this one . You hear that ? This one 's clear . That sounds clear to you ? Will be once i crack the encryption . Ok , english , raven . What does that mean ? It means ... We 'll be able to listen in on mount weather . Bellamy : Let 's go . Scott : Where are we ? Looks like a garage . More like a tomb . Look , i 'm sorry about your man , But we need to find an access door to mount weather . Hey , not so fast . Sir , that fog could keep us Pinned down for another ... We 'll split up . Be back here in 15 . Be safe . Let 's go . Stop . I 'm sure they 're fine . Everybody had tents . So first you can 't look at me , And now you 're looking at me like i 'm the enemy . I 'm not looking at you like that . Well , you don 't look at me the way you used to . I 've been waiting for the right moment to give you this . It 's starting to feel like that moment might not come . I know how much it means to you . Where did you get this ? It was around his neck . Jasper : Guys , think about everything they 've done for us . I mean , they gave us shelter , clean clothes . They kept us safe from the grounders . [ sighs ] Miller ? They saved your life , right ? Dude , you puked for 3 days . That was different . The normal treatments wouldn 't be as bad . So they say . Miller : So what , then ? Only puking for one day ? Nah . I 'm out . Harper : Sorry , jasper . I 'm out , too . Come on ! They gave us cake ! I got a sign-up sheet . Dude . What are you doing ? What ? When did you start working for them ? You know what ? Never mind . Now that you 're better , I 'm going after clarke . Of course . Right on time . Hey , guys . Jasper . I 'm so glad to see you 're feeling better . Thanks . I am . You look , um , rested . Hey , it 's pizza day . Heh ! Who 's hungry ? Maya : We don 't have much time , but we can talk freely here . Jasper : What the hell is going on ? Maya ? I 'm sorry . About what ? What ? What do you mean , it wasn 't an accident ? Monty : She means they exposed her to radiation on purpose . I 'm betting it was to get you to agree To be her blood brother . I knew it . Clarke was right . Monty , be quiet . Did you know about this ? No . And why would they do that to you ? Because the standard treatment sucks compared to you . That 's what dante said . What 's the standard treatment ? Through there . [ moaning ] Oh , my god . Are those ... All grounders ? Monty : Wait a second . Why are you showing us this ? Because i 'm afraid . Of what ? That you 're next . [ moaning ] Who else knows about this ? Everyone , But nobody talks about it . We learn not to ask questions . Look , without the treatments , we 'd die . What are we supposed to do ? Die . We have to get out of here . Dante said we could leave , right ? He was lying . [ scoffs ] He knew i 'd be too scared to leave , Just like he knew i 'd do what had to be done to save maya . So we don 't ask . If clarke got out , we can , too . You 'll never make it . Ever since clarke disappeared , Security all around the mountain has been increased . We have to try . We 're not leaving . I won 't leave the others behind . That means they end up in there . What choice do we have ? We volunteer . Abby : What 's taking so long ? I 've almost got it . They 're using a type of audio modulation here , Like a feedback loop . I just need to pinpoint the origin of the loop , Hone in on the pure transmission . [ signal sputtering ] i just need to find the right ... Cage on radio : ... Side and report back . Over . You did it . Man on radio : Copy that . Checking the western boundary line . Stand by . Over . No signs of life . Over . Cage : Has the veil lifted yet ? Over . Negative , sir . Coverage is still 90 % . Over . Keep searching . When they pop above , Hit them again . Over and out . " the veil . " They 're talking about the fog . It 's a weapon . Which means they attacked us . Sergeant porter ? Porter : Yes , ma 'am ? Build your bomb . When that fog lifts , take the tower down . Copy ? I copy , ma 'am . What 's wrong ? We 're listening to the enemy . Blow the antenna , and we won 't be able to do that . Don 't blow it , and we won 't make contact with any other Ark survivors , and we need those reinforcements , raven . Tough call . I know what clarke would do . [ cockroaches skittering ] Man , i hate that sound . [ glass shatters ] Check this out . [ women vocalizing on a christmas song ] [ thud ] Who 's that ? Blake ! That you , blake ? I don 't see anything . [ distant shouting ] [ singing continues ] ♪ ding dong ding dong ♪ ♪ ding dong ding dong ... ♪ Scott ? Are you there ? [ whispers ] bell , what 's that ? [ distant , hushed voices ] Octavia : Reapers . O. What ? Take this . [ cocks gun ] Don 't . It 's lincoln . Octavia : Lincoln . Lincoln , it 's me . It 's octavia . Oh ! Octavia ! Aah ! Get up . Get up . We need to get somewhere safe . Jaha : This has gone on long enough . There has to be some other way to resolve this ... Something that we haven 't thought of yet . There isn 't . Kane : She 's right . They 're not budging . [ whispering ] we can offer a trade . These people are primitive . I 've seen how they live . Our technology , our medicine . All we 'd ask for in return is peace . [ whispering ] if we truly want peace ... He told us how to get it . Through murder ? Through sacrifice . Jaha : Marcus , what are you doing ? If we don 't make a choice ... Then we 'll both die . And the killing won 't end . [ sighs ] There 's only one way out of this . You have to kill me . Kane : You have to do this . It 's our only choice . Kane , no . They respect strength . Let 's show them ours . I said ... No . Jaha : You did not order the massacre . Not that one . Marcus , you don 't need redemption . The choice we made on the ark was about survival . We did what we had to so that the human race could survive . The human race was already surviving . Then we did it for our people ! Yes , and now we must do this . It 's the only way . Not gonna happen . You 're a good man , thelonious . I won 't let you die for me . Marcus , no ! [ groaning ] Come on . Help us . Please . Please . Come on . Please . Thank you . I told you , We didn 't come all this way To die . Kane : Thelonious ! No ! I choose to live . [ panting ] [ whispering ] he 's a reaper ? How is it even possible ? He just looked right through me . Shh . How ? Huh ? Did he see us ? I don 't know . [ snarls ] [ glass squeaks ] Shh . Just listen to me . We 'll get him back . I promise . Take off these chains . Kane : Thelonious , please , she 's just an innocent girl . [ lexa speaking native language ] [ grunts ] ok . You 're the commander ? I 've learned much about you . It 's clear your intentions are honorable . Your desire for peace is true . Later we will talk . In the meantime , your friend will be used To send a message . No . Kane : No . No . Don 't look at him . Stop ! Kane : Stop ! Stop ! Please ! The massacre must be answered . Blood must have blood . You sure you 're ready for this ? Ok . Draw him in . I 'll do the rest . Lincoln ! [ metal clanking ] Octavia : Lincoln ! Can you hear me ? I 'm sorry . Bellamy : Hey ! [ lincoln groaning ] [ panting ] now what ? Now we take him home . [ birds chirp ] The fog has cleared . Clarke ? They were unarmed . We have to go . I don 't even know who you are anymore . Neither do i . What have we become ? Tsing : And you 're all set , monty . The general anesthetic will take effect shortly . You won 't feel a thing . [ equipment beeping ] How high are you right now ? Oh , i almost don 't care That there 's a 6-inch spike in my neck . [ chuckles ] Ohh . [ door opens ] [ door closes ] I must say i 'm impressed , jasper , And deeply grateful . These are just the first , sir . More will come . I have no doubt . You saved us , right ? It 's the least we could do . You see , doctor ? That 's our future . You just have to have a little faith in our shared humanity . I hope they 're all this compliant . Don 't worry about her , dad . Dr. Tsing isn 't big on admitting when she 's wrong . But i got to hand it to you . We 're getting the most effective treatments we 've ever had , And it 's all because you asked nicely . You think i 'm stupid ? Tell me you weren 't behind the breach That almost killed maya . I wasn 't . Dad , i wouldn 't ... I wouldn 't do that . I love you , cage , And there 's been a wallace in this office Since the bombs , but if i find out That you 're lying , there won 't be one After me . Am i making myself clear ? [ overlapping chatter ] [ music playing ] check it out . [ sighs ] i love this song . [ turns up volume ] ♪ come fashion all the ♪ ♪ i know ... ♪ Ok , it 's safe to talk . We bought ourselves some time , but we 're gonna need to recruit Some of the others , only people we trust . How much more time are we talking about buying here ? Monty : Exactly . Long enough for clarke to break us out . We don 't even know if clarke 's still alive . She has to be . Miller : Well , then she better hurry the hell up . Bellamy and octavia ? They know to rendezvous here . Have you tried to radio ? Still jammed . You didn 't blow the tower . Raven figured out a way that we could listen to mount weather . If we took out the antenna , we wouldn 't be able to do that . What about the other ark stations ? We don 't know if they made it . What we do know is that 47 of our people Are being held prisoner on that mountain . We 're gonna get them out . I 'm sorry . We all have battle scars , finn . Suck it up ... And build a brace for yours . Man : Help ! Stay here , chancellor . Man : Help me ! Show us your hands . Jaha : Stand down . [ panting ] Thelonious . I have a message From the commander . Leave ... Or die . We have two days .

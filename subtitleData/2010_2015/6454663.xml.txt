 I went to space on a 13-month solo mission . I didn 't come home alone . My husband created a lifelike android called a Humanich . His name is Ethan . He 's the prototype . This is a story about Earth . Ethan ! A story about family . A story about surviving . Previously on Extant : I 'm sorry , molly . - I can 't let you stand in the way . - Harmon ! No ... Harmon ! He wants you to help him . If you take him , I can come , too . Don 't shoot me ! I know where your family is . - My family is at home . - No , they 're not . Oh , my god . Stop ! He needs him . Don 't worry , daddy . Everything is going to be fine . Director Sparks is out there somewhere with your baby . I want you to bring it back to me . With everything you 've done to me ? John , Sparks is out there with the baby . Yasumoto is gonna send somebody with me . I just wish you 'd come to me instead . I know . I 'm sorry . Be careful . I will . Sorry . I 'm gonna need to take that . We don 't want anyone tracking us . We need to talk . Of course . I-I just spoke to my wife . She said that you 've sent someone to go with her t-t-to meet this thing . Yes . Dr. Mason . He 's extremely capable . Tha-That 's not the point . I come to you for help . I-I-I tell you about this ... situation , the danger of this thing , and you sent my wife off t-to meet it ? It 's her child . It 's half her child . Yet she sees it as her child . She saw it in the ultrasound . It has a human form . That 's not the half I 'm worried about . The decision was not mine alone . Molly has her own opinion in the matter . She 's not thinking rationally . You helped an emotionally fragile woman put herself in danger . I think Ethan and I had better go . I wish you wouldn 't . As you indicated , Alan Sparks is still out there . And , thanks to you , so is my wife . As I said , Dr. Mason is a worthy companion . I 'd feel so much better with you and Ethan here . Your safety is important to me . And , of course , to Molly . Big-picture people , they lose sight of what really matters . What does that mean ? I think that Yasumoto went about all this in completely the wrong way . We 'll bring your baby back . And it won 't be a lab-rat situation this time . It 'll be done on your terms . Thank you . So , you were doing bio-research on the Seraphim ? Worms . Viability in orbit ? Exactly . Everybody thinks the answers are out there . We have all the proof we need right in front of us . I was just down in Caracas . Found these microfossils embedded in meteorites , with all the biomarkers of terrestrial cyanobacteria . I mean , these life-forms , they 're coming to us . We don 't need to go to them . I can 't imagine what this must mean to you . Finally getting a chance to see your child . Ma 'am ? Ma 'am , look at me . Focus . Breathe . The baby 's crowning now . I 'm gonna need suction . Ma 'am , what is your name ? Molly ... Oh . Oh , God . I 'm seven-months pregnant . It is too soon , it 's too soon ... Molly , listen to me . You 're going to have your baby now . You don 't have time to make it to a hospital . - I need you to work with me , okay ? - Okay , okay , okay . Oh , God . Marcus ! Marcus ! Marcus ! Oh , no , no ! No ! Marcus ! No ! No , no , no , no , no , no ... Molly , I need you to focus . - No ! - Look at me . Your baby 's coming . - Push ! - Marcus ! Hey , honey . I hate to have to tell you this . The baby didn 't make it . We tried everything we could . He was just ... too little . " He " ? It was a boy ? I 'm so sorry . No . Oh , God . No , no , no . Oh , sweetheart , come here . No ... No . We 're about halfway there . Another hour , maybe . Tops . Anya ? The last time we were here , she was seven . I remember she fell in trying to grab a lily pad . You were so worried she 'd get an infection . It 's not fair , Alan , bringing me back here . I brought Mrs. Wimberley 's truck . My car barely made it up the hill . Anya , after you see what I want to show you ... if you still want to go , I promise I 'll bring you back . You sure ? Drones don 't lie . This is Anya Sparks ' car . Sparks must have figured out someone could find it . Had her meet him here , picked her up . Yeah , the drones didn 't think of that . Now what do you want to do ? They must be hiding someplace in these hills . Well , you used to be a cop . Time to act like one . It looks like a kidnapping case . This man took a small child . You should talk to Sheriff Dugan when he gets back . Sheriff Dugan is currently on a call . You can wait around for him , if you 'd like . When do you expect him ? Any minute , unless he stopped off for a burger at Jay Jay 's . It 's not every day we get to host a couple of Feds . We 'll check back later . Coming ? Alan , why did you drag me up here ? It won 't make any sense if I tell you . I just have to show you . This ... This place has too many memories . I never should have come . Please , Anya . You 've come this far already . You know me . I 've never had the kind of faith that helped with anything . But seeing this ... Just promise me you 'll give it a chance . Give what a chance ? Okay , enough . Mommy . She 's real . It 's not possible . You can touch her . It 's not possible . I was gone ... but now I 'm back . Oh ! Sheriff Dugan , there were two federal agents here about a kidnapping . They should still be in town if you 'd like to try and find them . A kidnapping ? Your drone footage from the Wimberley Woods shows a man who matches their description of the kidnapper . I 've notified Nancy . And if you 'd like , I can cross ... What 'd you want to go and do that for , Dugan ? I 'm gonna need a BIN number for the requisition form if it 's not blown all to crap . Nobody gets it , do they ? Gets what ? The miracle of all this . Life ... somewhere else in the universe . Life that we can ... I mean ... you had a child with it . So , what was it like ? Your encounter . I guess the reason I 'm asking is I 've heard some pretty hairy stories . It must 've been terrifying . No . It wasn 't . I 'm sorry . I mean , if this is hard to talk about . I just , I-I want to know what to expect . No . It 's-it 's not hard . I saw someone . He died a very long time ago . And-and just to see him again was ... well , it was beautiful . This was Marcus Dawkins ? From the academy ? He , uh ... died in a car accident , right ? I 'm sorry . Yasumoto gave me your file . I read through it on the flight . Yeah . It was him . You see , that 's the real miracle here . The fact that they can bring back the people that you 've lost . Well , I didn 't just lose him . I lost our baby in that same crash . I 'm sorry . That 's , um ... that 's tough . And I think that 's exactly why he came to me . It 's not just that we get to see the people that we lost . It 's like we get to start again . You know , we-we-we get to go down a new path . If that is your child 's gift , to guide us down these alternate pathways , then this is truly what I 've always dreamt of seeing . A moment of punctuated equilibrium . An evolutionary leap forward . Your child could be that leap . Well , you know ... you know , I 'm not one of these blue marble ladies . So ... " Blue marble ladies " ? Well , you know , astronauts go to space and they see the Earth and ... it looks like a big , beautiful blue marble . And then they start to think that everything is all peace and love . Well , the universe doesn 't care about us or our survival , so I never bought into any of that . I mean , 99.9 % of every species that has ever existed has now gone extinct . Cheerful world view . My point is we care about our survival even against those odds . We 're still here . I mean , that 's what evolution is , right ? Maybe ... every bad thing that 's happened is just a result of him trying to live , trying to protect himself . Exactly . And that 's why we need a different approach . We should get going . You ready ? We 'll take the check . Right away . Thank you . When you get out of town , there could be 20 miles of forest in every direction . We know Sparks made it this far . And traveling with the Offspring , this forest is as good a place to hide as any . The drones should be able to give us a location soon . We can 't wait for that . He could be moving . Well , if you want to poke around the woods on your own , be my guest . Or we could just ask him . Man you 're looking for , I know where he is . Come with me . Just the two of you working this alone ? We work out of the Anderson office . Call came in , we headed right out . When it involves a child , you can 't be too careful . Anderson ? You know Steve Tillman ? Steve ? Yeah . Good man . You hear that ? Loose contactor . I got to pull over . I 'm just gonna take a look . Contactor 's in the back . We always knew ... intelligent people knew that we weren 't the only thinking , feeling beings in the universe . And this is what you found ? We aimed our ships towards something . And this is what happened . But how does it do ... what it does ? I don 't know . It 's half human . It seems to be able to find them for us . The people we 've lost . Connect us to them . Bring them back . We need to keep it safe . Not just so that Katie can stay with us , but so that everyone can have this gift . Mommy ? Yes ? You won 't make me go back to that dark place , where dead people go ? It was lonely there . No , darling . I won 't ever let you go back there . Never . How long till Mom comes back ? She should be done with her research and meeting us at home soon . As long as we 're here , there are a few diagnostics I want to run down in the lab . Will Odin be there ? You two really seem to be hitting it off , huh ? I like him . He knows about things . I 'm sorry , sir . I 'm afraid I 'm gonna have to ask you to remain here . Heat sensors , huh ? Mr. Yasumoto gave explicit instructions . Until the immediate threat is contained , he really doesn 't think it 's a good idea for you to leave the office . We were just going to run downstairs to my lab . What 's an immediate threat ? Nothing . Just a misunderstanding Mr. Yasumoto is helping us clear up . That 's right , son . Just a misunderstanding . It 's just so much easier for us to keep an eye on you up here . I 'm sure you can understand . It 's for your safety . Please . Just the two of us , right ? You 're taking me to meet him ? Of course . That 's the idea here . And that 's it ? We get your baby . We bring the two of you back . Then Mr. Yasumoto puts all of his resources at your disposal . What ... ? Something 's wrong . I know it 's hard to get back trust once it 's been broken , but ... It 's trying to send me a message . Uh , those trucks that passed the diner , where were they going ? I really don 't know what you 're talking about . You had better stop this car . Something 's wrong . Listen , Molly , I understand . You have every reason to be cautious . But you have to believe me when I ... Take a seat anywhere you want . I 'll be with you in a sec . Can I use your phone , please ? Weren 't you just in here ? Yes , but I 'm having an emergency . I need to call my husband . Please . - Fine . - Thank you . - You can have some privacy up there . - Okay . If you do that , you 're going to lose in three moves . You learned fast . It 's simple . Mom ? - Hi , Ethan . - I learned how to play chess . Great . Can you give Dad the phone , please ? Okay . Ethan , can you please put Dad on the phone ? I need to talk to him in private . Is it another secret ? I need to talk to him about something , okay ? Is this about me ? No . It is not about ... Ethan . Can you please , please just give Dad the phone ? Come on . Hey . What 's going on ? Okay , look . John , I don 't have a lot of time , okay ? So listen . The man I 'm with , Dr. Mason , the baby doesn 't want me to be with him . Okay ? I have no idea why , and it really doesn 't matter right now , but he sent a flock of birds to attack him so I could get away . John ... I am not having a good feeling about this right now . I really think you and Ethan should get out of there . Is this something to do with Yasumoto ? I don 't know . But if it does , you shouldn 't be there . Hey . You got to go . Someone 's looking for you . Okay . John , I gotta go . - Hurry . - Thank you . - Oh ! - Sorry . This is for your own good . Come on . Have you played this before ? My dad just showed me . It 's easy . Well , people don 't think so . You just have to look at the connections . Nothing serious , I hope . Oh . Alan ! I can 't find her . She 's gone . No , no , no , no . She 's not gone . I 'll take care of this . Just wait here . I 'll take care of it , Anya . Katie ? Kate ? Katie . Daddy ? You 're here . Molly 's coming . What ? When ? He needs your help to complete his mission . He needs you to get Molly to do something that has to be done . Far away . I 'm not sure I understand . He needs to do something to her , and he needs to be stronger to do it . Stronger ? He 's going to need to feed again . Like what he did with that sheriff . You won 't see me again unless you help him . I 'm all right . It comes and goes . You have to pull it together . We don 't have time for you to detox . If you go soft , I 'll leave you . That 's why I left Molly . I thought you said you got split up . You left her in there to die ? I didn 't have any choice . You didn 't see what it made me see . Well , did it make you leave a friend to die , or was that your call ? I don 't know what you imagine . Some kind of second coming or the care and feeding of your new pet alien . Either way , you don 't have a clue . That thing has to be stopped . Connections must have come loose . I really appreciate this . Yeah , rough roads out here , man . Happens all the time . Uh , my wallet 's just inside . Oh , we got a pot of coffee on . I bet you 'd like a cup . Yes , I would . Is this what it takes for it to do what it does ? There are two kinds of feedings . I bring it food , and it seems to grow at an exceptional rate . And then there 's this . What its other half needs . They don 't die , but they are different after . You try to make your peace with it . Mommy . Look what I made . Everything comes at a cost . We can have our Katie back . I don 't care about the rest . I promise you , they 're just here as a backup . We just want to make sure we do this right . You go in there with all these guys , it 's not gonna go right . I hope you told them to say good-bye to their families . Molly , I 'm not the enemy here . I care about exactly what you care about . Look , I 'm sorry about this . I really believe that this is the best way to do it . With force and more armed men ? I don 't think that 's the way to do it . Like I said before , it 's just a contingency . Molly . Your baby ... it 's half yours and half this ... other . And yes , it 's trying to protect you . And yes , it wants you , but this other ... Frankly , it would be presumptuous to believe that it thinks like we do . Because he wants to live ? And needs his mother ? I guess I 'm presumptuous . And I guess I 'm cautious . Look , we both want the same thing . We both want to keep your baby safe . I 'll keep my baby safe . " ' I won 't , ' said Alice . " ' Off with her head ! ' the Queen shouted " at the top of her voice . Nobody moved . " ' Who cares for you ? ' said Alice . " She had grown to her full size by this time . 'You 're nothing but a pack of cards ! ' " " At this point , " the whole pack rose up into the air " and they came flying down on her . She gave a little scream , half of fright ... " She 's here . It 's time . Go talk to your Offspring . You want to meet your son ? Go ahead . He 's waiting . So , you 're doing fine . No permanent damage was done . Marcus is in intensive care . But the bleeding 's stopped . He 's tough . He 's gonna pull through . Good . The baby ? Right there . It was close for a while , but he 's a tough one , too , and he 's doing great . Do you want to touch him ? Come on . I 'll help you up . Come on . You 're doing good . Here we go . Aw . Oh , my gosh . This is what you always dreamed of seeing . You 're beautiful . I 'm gonna let the two of you get acquainted . I 'm gonna come back and check on you later , okay ? Okay . Hi . Hi . Hi , little guy . You 're just beautiful . Please . Please . You 'd better hold tight , ' cause the second you let me go , I 'll kill you ! I 'll kill both of you ! You know who we 're looking for . I know . I know ! Tell us where he is . You want to find him ? Yeah ... I 'm happy to tell you . Yeah ... He 'd want to find you . He 'd be happy to meet you . How are you doing ? I 'm okay . I want to apologize to you . For what ? Well ... sometimes when you 're a father ... it 's ... difficult to admit to yourself that your kids are growing up . That they have minds of their own . That they 're their own people . Because that means someday they won 't need you . You 're growing up ... and that , more than anything , is what I want for you . It 's just ... I was having trouble with it for a while . You 've acted like you 're mad at me a lot lately . And I 'm really sorry for that . Here it is . I 'm going to ask you to do something that 's very hard and very grown-up . Okay ? Mr. Yasumoto doesn 't want us to leave this place . Why doesn 't he want us to leave ? I don 't know . But I need you to go find Julie , tell her this and tell her to get you out of the building . How am I gonna get downstairs ? I 'm gonna have to turn down your warmers , so you can get past the sensors . It 'll be okay for as long as it takes you to get downstairs . Once you are in the lab , just ask Julie to turn them back on . I know how to turn them on myself . Wow . I guess you do . You really think I can do this ? I know you can do this . Are you ready ? Warning . Oxygen flow restricted . Heart rate decreasing . - Warning . - No . No . - Immediate action required . - No , no , no . Somebody help ! Help ! We need help ! Somebody help ! Oh ! Molly , it 's Ben . I 'm here to help . Ben ? There 's nothing to worry about . It 's an RDS issue that just needs a ventilation adjustment . I can walk you through the procedure . Okay . O-Okay , Ben . Tell me what to do . It 's just some code . I 'll dictate ... you enter . It 's going to be fine . Start with your access code . Okay . Okay . Okay . Then your operation code . It 's going to be fine . Good . Now ... P-thred ... underscore exit ... and you 're done . Okay . The code has been accepted . Congratulations , Molly . Your baby is going to be fine . Oh . Oh , God . What was that , Ben ? There 's been a remote adjustment to our course . It was a Debris Avoidance Protocol ordered by an ISEA admin . Mm . Next time , maybe a little heads-up ? What 's the new course ? Actually , we 're headed towards Earth . But don 't get your hopes up . It 's only temporary . Funny . Excuse me . Dr. Woods . I , uh ... I had a little issue with Ethan I wanted to tell you about . Everything 's okay , I hope ? Uh , well , he 's been acting sort of moody . First , I thought it was a programming problem , but , uh , then , uh ... you 're-you 're gonna appreciate this , Ms. Dodd ... uh , it was a kid thing , you know , something I had to fix with patience , not-not with , uh , parts . I don 't know if-if you 've run into this sort of thing in your work . The employees who needed to be given more responsibilities , who stopped thriving without those responsibilities ... Most people truly need their independence , or - the illusion of it , to thrive . - That 's exactly my point . I mean , I 'm not sure , with Ethan anyway , that the illusion would be enough . Hey , little guy . What 's going on ? I need to find Julie . We 're in trouble . Okay , well , she 's already left . I can take you to her . Is this like big " T " trouble or little " t " trouble ? Big , I think . Okay , we better go , then , right ? You can tell me about the big " T " on the way . I put the Offspring in the car . Molly 's given us what we need . We have to go . For Molly ? No . It 's better if we bring her . He wants his mom . I need you to put Molly in the car . They must be in there . We blow the propane tank under the cabin and burn this thing to the ground . You still don 't get it , do you ? It keeps getting stronger and stronger . It has to be stopped . That is not your call to make . Molly . You shoot me if you have to . I have to make this right . Let her go ! Let her go ! I said , let her go ! Something 's wrong . Where-where ... where 's my baby ? I want my baby ! Harmon ? Harmon . Oh , God . Oh , God . - Breathe . Breathe . - The baby 's not here . Molly , it used you to get here for a reason . It 's getting stronger . You brought it here . You have to stop it . Uh ... Harmon . Harmon ! Harmon ! Oh , God . Oh , God . Harmon . Harmon .

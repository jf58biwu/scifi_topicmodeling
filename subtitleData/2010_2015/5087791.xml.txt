 Aah ! Oh ! Forget that stuff ! She 's going down ! What 's happening ? Hurry ! Is everyone out ? Where 's Hodgson ? [ suspenseful music plays ] [ breathing heavily ] Oh ! Hodgson ! Get out . We 're abandoning ship ! Yeah , I got that from the annoying alarms . I have to shut down the reactor core . If it melts down , the entire region will be a dead zone ! [ crash ] [ grunting ] [ crash ] [ grunts ] [ beep ] [ motor whirring ] [ grunting ] [ crashing ] [ metal creaking ] [ roars ] This will not end well . [ roars ] ♪ so make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way we 're gonna have fun tonight ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ ♪ so make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ [ snarls ] [ roaring ] [ clanking ] Rex : We 're breaking up ! Reroute all power to the hull ! Ah ! It 's working , captain ! [ whoosh ! ] Six : Bath time 's over . We have a mission . Rex : Oh , yeah ? Where to ? Six : The middle of the Pacific . [ water splashes ] Rex : Excelente ! [ dramatic music plays ] This is going to be so great , Six . I 've dreamed of being an undersea explorer for ... I don 't know ... as long as I can remember . Six : You only remember the last 18 months . Rex : I dream fast . Look , I don 't know how many times my brain 's been rebooted , but , for now , I 'm cramming it full of cool memories while I can . And exploring the ocean , that 's major , like visiting another planet . Smile . [ camera shutter clicks ] Uh , close enough . [ beep ] Dr. Holiday : We 're coming up on the drop coordinates . I 'll link you to the exterior camera feed . Welcome to trash island . Rex : Cool ! How big is that thing ? Dr. Holiday : About twice the size of Texas . The same currents that formed it have swept up every nanite in the north Pacific . Who knows how many evos are down there ? Rex : Sea monsters ! What every explorer dreams of . Dr. Holiday : Something sunk that ship yet didn 't harm the crew . Rex : Bonus . A sea monster with a conscience . Dr. Holiday : With intelligence . Don 't let your guard down . We can 't communicate once you 're submerged . Six : How long do we have ? Dr. Holiday : It depends on the conditions of the reactor core . If the rods are cracked , it could already be leaking radioactivity . But if the core melts down , its radioactive steam could travel to the mainland . [ beeping ] Rex : Yeah , if it doesn 't blow up first . Dr. Holiday : No danger of that , but you 'd never need a night light again . Bring me back a souvenir . [ dramatic music plays ] Rex : Whoa . That 's worse than the bottom of my closet . And we 're diving into that ? Six : Just hold your nose . Rex : [ grunting ] Whoa ! Oh , yeah ! [ whistle ! ] [ splash ] This is amazing . Six : Six the coral is using the trash as a foundation material . Rex : You see trash ? Guess , it 's all in how you look at it . It 's a city . I 'm gonna say we are definitely not alone down here . Six : Whoever constructed this now has the weapon potential of the reactor core . And don 't touch the controls . [ whoosh ! ] Rex : That window is alive ! And there 's air in there ! Six : A city big enough to house an army and perfectly hidden . The research ship could have been taken down for getting too close . Rex : Well , I 'm not seeing any army . So far , all I 've seen is ... [ alarm beeping ] Fish ? [ screeches ] Rex : Incoming ! [ crash ] Six : I 've lost steering . Take the controls . Try to outrun them . Rex : Oh , so , now I get to ? Awesome ! [ crash ] Aah ! Aah . Less awesome . Six : I just need a moment to reprogram a torpedo . [ roars ] Six : Got it . [ beep ] Hold on . Rex : Ew ! Ouch ! Two heads , twice the headache . Six : Suit up . We need to check the damage . [ bubbling ] Rex : Did you really need the sunglasses ? Okay , maybe so . Six : One of the steering vanes is bent . We need to remove it . [ eerie wailing in distance ] Rex : Whatever that sound is , it 's really creeping me out . Six : Fish communicate with sonic waves . I suspect those are commands . [ suspenseful music plays ] There ! Rex : You fix the sub ! I 've got the chum . Come on , this way ! Over here ! Whulp ! [ bubbling ] [ clank ! ] Uh , this may be a problem . [ roars ] [ clank ] [ roars ] [ crash ] [ screeching ] Rex : Come on , come on ! Little farther , little farther ! [ clank ] [ bubbling ] - No , no , no ! - [ snarls ] Rex : Okay . New strategy . [ grunting ] Rex : Yes ! Oh , no ! Not down ! Bad fish , bad ! [ suspenseful music plays ] Finally found something that works underwater ! Six : Hostiles on our nine . [ screeches ] Six : [ grunting ] Surge : [ whistling ] Rex : Where is that coming from ? Six : Rex ! Rex : I 'm gonna say the fish squeaks are coming from him . [ roars ] [ dramatic music plays ] Rex : Hang on ! [ roaring ] Rex : I don 't know about you , but I 'm craving me some fried calamari . Six : Closer . [ clanking ] [ suspenseful music plays ] [ roars ] Six : Keep your head down . Take us in . [ whoosh ! ] Rex : So , ringing the doorbell is out of the question ? [ crash ] [ splash ] Rex : How is this better ? Six : Climb ! [ zip ! ] Rex : Huh ? [ soft music plays ] - [ camera shutter clicks ] - Six : Impressive . Rex : This place is awesome ! - [ slurps ] - Rex : Aah ! You saw the evo riding the squid , right ? Mr. Tall , dark , and mermaid-y ? [ clicking ] [ growling ] [ eerie music plays ] [ growling ] Rex : I 'm thinking I 'll skip the " melted butter " joke . [ growls ] Rex : That claw just winked at me . - [ claw snaps ] - Hey ! Surge : [ echoing ] it 's their natural instinct to protect their territory ... Even to the death . We will not stand for any more attacks on Aquannia . Rex : Aquannia ? Really ? Please tell me that name wasn 't your idea . Six : We haven 't attacked you or your city . Surge : Liar ! You fired torpedoes and injured this very room ! Six : To escape your squid . Rex : Um , why don 't we lighten up a bit ? Less accusing , more amusing ? Six : The fact remains , you attacked an innocent research ship . Rex : So , you did all this ? How did you get coral to take orders ? Surge : Innocents ? ! As soon as those " innocents " find something profitable , a hundred more ships come to dredge and scrape out the ocean floor ! [ snarling ] Rex : Uh , guys , guys ? Sort of freaking out the kids , here . Surge : After that , the drills arrive , spitting out oil that chokes everything under it ! Just leave us alone ! [ growling ] [ claws snapping ] [ snarls ] [ roars ] Rex : Aah ! [ roars ] Surge : Just following their natural instincts . [ engine revs ] [ dramatic music plays ] Rex : Get small ! What next ? [ whoosh ] Aah ! Aah ! Ask a stupid question ... [ clanking ] Ugh ! Aah ! I 'm rethinking the undersea-explorer career option . [ sighs ] Six : Don 't . Let me . There . Is the paralysis spreading ? Rex : Give me a sec . [ beeping ] Nanites took care of it ... I think . Six : This is from a scarlet cobra urchin . You were lucky , Rex . It would have killed a normal person . Rex : You know a little too much about things that can kill you , Six . Six : We need to find the reactor core . No telling what he plans to do with it . Rex : I doubt he even knows what he has . Sure , he 's a little nutty . I mean , he came up with " Aquannia . " But this place is more like a paradise than a military camp . - [ egg cases creaking ] - I mean , how many extremists do you see running a nursery ? - [ splash ! ] - Oh , yuck ! - Six : Please stop touching things . - [ crying ] Rex : Maybe they want their mommy . [ growling ] I suppose * * * a mommy . Six : Come no further . [ growling ] Rex : Uh , what are you doing ? Surge : An example of why I keep the company of fishes instead of men . Rex : Oh , come on , guys ! Truce ! Six : Rex ! Rex : Maybe that research ship looked like trouble to you , but they were just documenting the pollution to make people understand the harm their garbage does . But if you think you 're the one getting the shaft , we 'll listen . Come on . What could it hurt ? [ eerie music plays ] Surge : After my change , I found I had a closer bond with these new species . Rex : With what , telepathy ? Surge : No . I understand their natural instincts and use them to modify their behavior . [ roars ] [ camera shutter clicks ] Rex : Oh , like a fish whisperer . Six : And " modifying behavior " includes sinking ships ? Surge : The facts are clear ! I build . You destroy . Rex : Hey , I know . Introductions . This is Six . My name is Rex . Surge : Six . That 's a machine 's name . Rex : I think that we 've established that not everyone is good at picking names . And you are ? Surge : Surge . Rex : Now , see , that 's totally rad ... strong , powerful , like a ... like a tidal Surge , right ? Surge : It 's my name ... Short for Sergio . Rex : Right . Well , works both ways . [ soft music plays ] Surge : There is much to do if the oceans are to be clean Again . [ slurps ] Surge : These anemones can process even oil and plastics into food that is circulated throughout the coral colony . The coral builds everything we need , even the mirrors that bring light from ... - [ rumble ] - Rex : Whoa ! Seaquake ! Surge : No , it 's just a curse that you humans have set upon me ! It became jammed into the lower spires and is now at the mercy of the currents . Rex : It 's the research ship ! Surge : The shaking will stop when the crab men cut it free and drop it into the abyss . Rex : Yeah . Bad idea . See ? He doesn 't want a weapon . He has no idea what he has ! Surge : Weapon ? ! So , your interest in my work was a lie ? ! Six : It 's not a weapon , but it will destroy your home . - [ rumble ] - Rex : We 're running out of time ! Six : Listen to me . The reactor inside that ship would be crushed . If it leaks , this whole stretch of ocean will be unlivable . Rex : That 's why we came , to get the thing out of here ! To protect the ocean . Really . Go green . Yay ! Surge : We 'll inspect it together . If you 're telling the truth ... [ rumbling ] [ suspenseful music plays ] [ thud ] [ bubbling ] You 've poisoned us all ! Rex : Anyone up for plan " b " ? Surge : We 're over a deep-sea trench . Even I can 't withstand the depths down there . Rex : Then we better hope I can . [ splash ] [ splash ] Surge : The boy will be crushed before he reaches the ship , and that reactor will destroy Aquannia . Six : Underestimating him would be your biggest mistake . You 're going to have to work fast , Rex . We don 't know how much pressure you can take . Rex : Come on , Six . You know I do my best work under pressure . Some lights are still on . Six : That means the reactor is probably still okay . Rex : Yeah , but the ship is sliding into the trench ! Six : If it starts breaking up , get out whether you have it or not . Rex : Ignoring that part . Six : [ garbled ] radio updates as you make your way through the ship . Rex : I can 't hear you ! Must be the steel hull . Don 't worry . I got it covered . At least I hope I do . [ metal creaks ] Whoa ! Ugh ! Great going , Rex . White knight will probably take this out of your imaginary paycheck . And I sort of needed it to breathe . [ metal creaking ] [ explosion ] Aah ! Ah , there you are . Okay , this should be easy . Except for the whole " no air " thing . [ inhales deeply ] Going great ! Everything 's cool ! [ inhales deeply ] Got to learn to build myself a submarine . [ coughing , gagging ] Okay , maybe I didn 't think this through . [ panting ] Come on , Rex ! Focus or you 're gonna be fish food . [ inhales deeply ] [ grunting ] Whoa , that 's trippy . I can breathe ! The radioactive rods ! We can 't leave them , and I can 't carry them all . [ metal creaks ] Seaweed bubble wrap ... 100 % natural and crab-man approved . Up top ! Ugh ! Never mind . Six : I understand what you 're trying to do here . I see no reason to reveal Aquannia to anyone for now . Forgive my suspicions . Rex : And what else did we learn today ? Surge ? Six ? Anyone ? To see things from the other person 's point of view . Surge : I do have more paralyzing urchin spines if you want them . Rex : Smile . [ camera shutter clicks ] Six : You realize if anyone saw those ... Rex : [ sighs ] I know . Maybe we can come back and visit . Six : I 'd rather not . Rex : I figured you 'd say that . [ squeaks ] Rex : It 's for Holiday . She said to bring her back a souvenir . Six : Just don 't expect me to feed it .

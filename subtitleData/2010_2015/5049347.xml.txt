 There is darkness ... There is light . There are men and women . There 's food . There are restaurants . Disease . There 's work . Traffic . Days , as we have known them . The world , as we imagined the world . How do you feel about heading home ? I 've just fallen asleep . You have ? I haven 't . I have a tight time sleeping with someone else in bed . You 're kicking me out ? I have to go to work soon anyway . We danced and drank all night , we go back at your place , you fucked me , and now you wake me up and kick me out ? I can 't sleep with another person in bed . That 's funny . - That 's the way it is . I didn 't know you 've started smoking again . What do you feel like doing ? - Throwing stones . At what ? - At seagulls . Sweetheart ... - You 'll find someone . - Shut up and throw . I suppose I should go back to work . Come . Lebanon ? Moroccan . Moroccan . That 's funny . - What 's funny ? Seeing you today . - It 's hilarious . Come with me for a minute , will you ? We 're wanted in the hospital . Aren 't you going to ask me why I haven 't come to work ? Have you been sick ? - Not sick . Just not happy . Well , it 's the same thing . Unhappy on account of men . - No kidding ? So , why are we wanted for ? - To see a patient . - Why ? What 's going on ? We 're just going to find out . Well , you know , he is very pissed off . Excuse me , when can we take him back home ? We just need to talk to him , and ... He needs to and explain the whole thing again ? - Well ... Look . Listen ... He called me and told he was coming home . And then , all of a sudden his voice changes , and he bursed into tears . And then he starts telling me that he doesn 't see any meaning in life . He 's not usually like that . He is a truck driver . - Okay . Then he pulls over the side and says he 's fine again . He said , he can 't smell anymore . He can 't smell anymore ? I told we 'll find hospital . Because , you know , that isn 't normal , is it ? Hello ... Donald . Stephen Montgomery here , again . Hi , I 'm Susan . Hi , Stephen . Hi , Susan . You can 't smell anymore ? That 's right , Susan . I can 't smell anymore . But is your mood back to normal ? I 've been sitting here nearly eleven hours , my mood is not great . But you don 't feel any other discomfort , other than the lack of smell ? No , Susan . And has anybody else in your family or work had similar experiences ? I haven 't got a clue ' cause I 'm sitting here , aren 't I ? What do you want from me ? I just want your opinion . - I 'm an epidemiologist , Stephen . So why am I talking to this guy ? Because we have seven more just like him in Aberdeen . Five in Dundee . Eleven here in Glasgow ... Eighteen in Edinburgh . About one hundred reported cases in England ... And then we got France , Belgium , Italy and Spain . They all appeared in the last 24 hours . How were they infected ? - I 'm not sure they are . Meaning ? All the early indications suggest no connection between them at all . No contact . No pattern . Nothing . Is my wife still in there ? Let me speak to my wife . Please , let me speak to my wife . Maybe we should just go . So we won 't panic . Michael , that table of twelve just sat down . Are they at the bar ? - Yes , at the bar . By the way , you 're a true champion . What is the matter with you ? What are you talking about ? We 'll start with the table seven . That girl was a sweetheart . What girl ? You just fucked her and dumped her , didn 't you ? You 're little baby . Teresa , where are those salads ? Okay , one oysters , soup , an antipaste , two ducks and a stake rare . Tell them to eat the breakfast . Strawberries , heat the milk for the coffee . They want to fuck the nice guy , they don 't want to fuck the asshole . How about those ravioli , boys ? How long ? Three minutes , chef . - Right , right , right . Chef ... - How do we know it 's fresh ? We smell it ? - No , check the eyes . Eyes should be clear and gills should be red , not pink . And the smell ? - Fishy ? You should smell the fish , but if smells fishy than it 's not fresh . You should smell the sea . Do you smell the sea ? Mostly smells like fish . Richard , get me another fucking sea basket . One day ... One day , son , you 'll be in love . And you 'll be miserable . Table seven ! That 's your karma . - All done ! Truly in love and miserable . Richard , I need that pot back ! Richard ! - Hi , Jen . - Hi , sweetheart . Really ? Do you want to come with me ? - Of course I do . - Great . I can find someone else , if you 're busy . Don 't worry , It may not be that serious . I 'll call you as soon as I know more . Ok ? Would you give me a cigarette ? - I 'm on the phone ! Who are you talking to ? - It 's nothing . It 's just a guy asking for cigarette . Okay , okay , bye . - Have you got a light ? How about boarding and lodging ? No , I don 't know your name . Do you have one , though ? Shit . Oh , dear . I 'm Michael . I work at the restaurant , there . All right , sailor . - I am chef . - Good for you . Come on , guys . What do we got ? We 've checked all the Scottish cases but we have no obvious match . There is no proteine mutating , no prions . Nothing . There 's nothing to say it 's a virus . There 's nothing that matches anything we know . But it is fair to say it isn 't obviously that is contagious . It 's fair to say it 's spreading . Okay . It can be environmental , it could be a toxin we know nothing about . It could be terrorism . Okay , it 's not contagion , I 'll tell them ... It may disappear in a short way , and don 't panic . Maybe they put something in the water . Overwhelmed with grief ... People are hit with all they have lost . Lovers they never had ... All the departed friends ... The think of all the people they hurt ... First overwhelmed with grief . And then no sense of smell . That 's a disease . They called it " Severe Olfactory syndrome " . SOS . This is obviously a cause for concern , and requires a high state of alert . But it 's not a cause for alarm . They say it is not contagious . But who would believe that ? Nothing . How should we call the night ? I do not know how what the fuck should we call it . Let 's go chase some pretty ladies . You chase and I 'll pick up the peaces . I don 't feel like it , James . - Come on ! That happens when you have too much high class fun . Enjoying in the Europs finest . I 'm going to get Entonoks , quick ! - What is that ? Entonoks . Laughing gas . Richard , don 't ... You 'll make him feel ... James , leave him alone . James ! I recommend it for you especially , sir . - James , put it back . What ? Wait , wait . Stop . Smell my finger ? - Yes , I smelled it . How does it smell ? - Oranges . Wrong . Balls ! Man dead ! Man dead ! Quickly . Evacuate ! Good night . - See you later . See you , boys . - Good night . Keep smiling . - Buy , James . Got your own smokes tonight , sailor ? I am still a chef . My dad called everybody a sailor . His worked in a dock all his life . Never went sailing anywhere , but he called everybody a sailor . All right . Even the people he didn 't know . Hello , sailor . Goodbye , sailor . Well you can call me sailor if you like . Or Michael . When I was a child , I found it really embarrassing . Now I do it myself . Are you hungry ? People aren 't eating in restaurants these days , and we got a lot spare food . This is ... Mac Fish . Fish is my thing . Good ? I 'm a bit greedy when I eat . - That 's all right . I had eating disorders when I was younger . Trying to catch up . What do you do ... when you 're not eating ? Death and misery . - What ? I am an epidemiologist . I 'll get something sweet . This is a mango jelly , and ... chocolate macaroni . And ... I didn 't make these , I don 't know what the fuck it 's called but I think it 's with coconut ... God ... All that sailor stuff , reminds me of him . My dad . I miss him so much ... We had so much fun together , he could always make me laugh . I 'm ... Let me get you ... This is ... This is clean . - Thank you . I 'm okay . You 're all right . Do not stand so close . You don 't know . No , they say it 's not contagious . We do not know . That 's just something we tell people . Look ... Would you like me to get you back to your home ? Yes ? Come on . Take that cloth . Hey ! It 's gone . The smell . All gone . Well , I ... It was a crazy evening . - Yes . Good morning . Well , this has its benefits . Yes . We were in Algarve once , Maggie and me . We came home , and found the freezer full of food made a power cut . I 've never smelled anything so disgusting in my life . I 'll never forget it . Maybe you will . I 've met someone . - Okay . I 'm pathetic . Not even sure I like him . - Okay . Actually , I think he is a smooth asshole . It will probably come back . By the moment , our customers won 't be able to smell , so ... Don 't prepare light . Bring out the big guns , all right ? Life goes on . The food becomes spicy . Salty . More sweet . More sour . You get used to it . The greater loss are all the memories that are no longer triggered . Smell and memory were connected to the brain . Cinnamon might have reminded you of your grandmother 's apron . The scent of cut hay could awoke a child who had a fear of cows . Diesel oil might bring back memories of your first ferry crossing . Without smell an ocean of past images disappears . I 'm off work . - Congratulations . Are you okay ? - Yes . Any more news of death and misery ? - Not really . I was a really good smeller . I bet you were . - I was ! Do you want a cigarette ? - No , thanks . Something else , then ? - Like what ? Are you hungry ? - No . I can cook you something special . Or buy you buy a lollipop . We could go for a coffee and an apple pie and licorice . A glass of wine ? Some fresh air ? Come on ! My sister got married a few years ago , came to stay for a month ... And met a guy . And then a good job came up . And now , ladies and gentlemen ... We 'll call for a new smell . The scent of the forest after a spring rain . We imagine a path underneath our feet . We see that we moist colors surrounding us . And we feel the wet branches , against our faces . And now imagine ... We pass between the trees . Come on . And we begin joining in the air . Deep inside and enjoy the moment . Humidity level is high . At the lower ... There 's the fungi , the water leaves . In the middle is tall , fresh grass . A crisp and almost invigorating scent . And at the top , we feel not only the leaves and the rain , but also , the sky . On a day like this , we can smell the sky itself . What should we do now ? Well now you can invite me back to your place . I don 't know if I want . Well you can just start walking home and I 'll follow you . I should have made a better effort to sniff you the first time you were lying here . Pity . What do you want ? - What do I want ? Yes . Soon I 'd like to close my eyes and try to go to sleep . Which is a big deal to me because usually I can 't sleep in bed with someone . I need to be by myself . Okay ? Now ? - Now , yes . - You want me to leave ? I live here , so I guess you 'll have to . Now ? - Yes , please . Did I say something wrong ? Let me give you my card , in case you want to , you know ... call me or something . - You have a card ? I lead a catering company that doesn 't do very well . Not very many clients . Lots of cards . You can call me . My number 's there , and address . I guess you know where I work , so ... Do you know this is the Day of the Lord ? The prophesy has been spoken ! Do you pray ? Come back , if you will ! This is the day of the prophesy ! Hello . No flowers ? She loved flowers , Michael . Ian got married . In the church . Apparently she is pregnant ... his bride . And what about this Michael ? What about him ? - He sounds nice . I do not know . I usually pick assholes . They can 't all be assholes . They just can 't . I 'm trying to take care of myself . Right . You do that a lot , don 't you ? Fuck you , sailor ! Let me see ... What do you say ? - One for you . And one for you . Not just a soap . Big soap . Big soap . Apparently . Big tobacco , big Cola , for this coctail to start selling " Fruity flavour oxygen " . In order to create a proper market , we should need a big soap . And the big soap will fill the environment with enough organophosphate to temporarily disable your central nerve system . That 's why I stopped washing . In case you are wandering what the smell was ... You 're full of shit . The Environmental Grief assures the start of ecological apocalypse . Caused by pollution and genetically modified plants and hormones . Intelligent claims that it is an attack on the free world . All indicators point the fundamentalists . The fundamentalists talk of God 's punishment on a world of unbelievers . And promise that all pure people with the right faith will regain their sense of smell , in the final days . Others talk of a corruption in capitalist system , Military virus to stimulate the economy . And there are other theories . There is so much hatred in the world ! So much hatred ! So much hatred in the world . - Stephen ! Stephen , calm down ! - Easy ! They are going to blow us up . They want to destroy us . So much hatred , so much hatred . So many sharp edges , so many sharp edges . It 's okay . - Sharp things . We just have given him maximum sedatives . It will pass in a second . So many sharp edges . - It 's okay . We are so soft . - It 's all right . We are so soft . Are you all right ? - I can 't die alone . I am here with you . I 'm Barbara . I work in research . I have seen you in the canteen . Calm down . What is your name ? It betrays us ... Yes , it betrays us . Michael , come on . - No , listen . Your body takes away the color of your skin . - What ? And betrays you ... Bring some water over here ! - What 's wrong with him ? I have seen it . The end . You 're all alone . Do not say that . James , you 'll die all alone . Don 't say that ! - You 're all alone ! Michael , stop . Michael , don 't say that . First , the terror . Do not leave me , Michael . Do not leave me , Michael . And then the moment of hunger . This is how the sense of taste disappears from our world . They don 't even have the time to give the disease a name . Do you think we will lose and the other senses too ? Smell and taste are related . They are two chemical senses . So , the other ones will be all right , then ? - They might . We 'll just have to wait and see . - That 's right , sailor . And what happens if you 're wrong ? Then we are fucked . It 's still out there . Who ? - The World . What can you see ? - People . What are they doing ? - They are heading off to work . What should we do ? We go to work as well . Do we kiss each other first ? Maybe . I 'd like to see each other again . We probably do . Maybe even this evening . Maybe . And I 'm looking forward to that . - Yes ! I may not have a job anymore . Forget it , Michael . We are closed . We are closed . We will open again . People can 't smell , they can 't taste . They 're going to buy flour and fat . That 's all you need to survive . Take a hit on that . Go on . Now that is a damn expensive brandy . Damn , damn expensive . But you might as well drink surgical spirit , or sniff glue . Doesn 't matter . It 's flour and fat . - It does matter . There is no difference . - No , I think you 're wrong . Life goes on . They will come back . People will ask each other to dinner again . They will toast each other in there , while we take care of their needs . We will sell them flour and fat . - No , anything but flour and fat . We will be all right . Slowly , things returned to normal . And life goes on . People do what they did before as best they can . Within a few weeks , taste becomes a distant memory . And different sensations take its place . And restaurants are all about offering another person a dinner . Letting yourself waited on . Listening to the trickle of vine and the clink of glasses . Not only has the food received a special attention but also the temperature of the food and it 's consistency . And we tried it all . From the freezing-cold to the scorching hot . It was dry , it was moist , it was crisp . it was spongy , crunchy and it was all at the highest level , up to the including desert a light pudding with caramelised nuts and a bright orange sorbet dark blue on blackberrys and black currant . Cheers on that . Great . - Life goes on . My dad let me shave him once . I was eight . I managed to do it without a single scratch . I was very proud . And then ... He went to the sink and he shaved himself all over again as if I haven 't been there . I was devastated . Your turn . Try . It 's soft . Would you like to go dancing ? - Sure . And get drunk . - Sure . And smoke cigarettes . - Always . Enjoy in the pleasures all day ? Let 's have them . All of them . I 've got a soap in my eye . Let 's play a game , sailor . - What game ? Is called " Make me special . " What are the rules ? - Only one . Just tell me something . - Something ? Something other people don 't know about you . Something secret . - Like what ? My sister has got two kids . I sometimes hate them . I can 't have children . My ovaries are crippled . My eggs are no good . Because of not eating . I pretended I 'm not that into them , I have an interesting job ... Anyway ... I can 't have them . Your turn . I had a girlfriend . You don 't get this game , do you ? No , I had a wedding planned . And she got sick . She was already sick . You can smell that there is something wrong inside that there is something damp in the basement . I didn 't stay with her . I didn 't look after her . I ran away . I make myself visit her grave . First that was once a week , and then maybe once a month , now even less ... I go there to feel guilty , you know ? I thought I would feel guilty for the rest of my life , but ... Actually it 's starting to fade . You 're an asshole . - I am . It works . I 'm an asshole . - So am I. A couple of assholes . Mr. and Mrs. asshole . That 's the situation here , in Bangkok , Thailand . We call it the " Severe hearing loss syndrome " . We still do not know much about it . Anger , rage , hatred . And then they go deaf . And how does it spread ? I can 't hear you . I don 't know what to do . Tell me what to do ! Don 't just stand there looking at me . I think it 's okay to panic now . And that 's basically what the world does . Severe hearing loss syndrome . Spreads from Thailand . Across India , to China , Russia and beyond . Rage ... Anger ... Hatred . And then , the loss of another sense . All the uninfected can do , is waiting . Can you still get film on those ? - Yes . I got this stuff from my uncle . He was a collector . - What did he collect ? Polaroid cameras . Very aggressive . Yes ? Yes . We stick to the 2006 plan . Stephen ? - Okay . It 's still valid . Isolate the first ones and get ready for the others . They say the child was born in Berlin with all the senses . Might be a chance of antibodies . What is going on ? Somebody is infected on the third floor . They are sealing it off . Who owns that restaurant ? - Me . You 're shutting down . - Give me a fucking brake ! Everywhere are shutting down . The council wants you and your staff to cook for the quarantine . We have thousands of people held up in their homes , sport arenas ... They all need to be fed , three times a day . Here is the menu and budget for the coming week . There is plenty of restaurants . If you don 't want the job , just say no . All I need to hear is ... a no . - All right . We 'll do it . That 's very moving . I even got tears . Fuck you . Look , we are just trying to do our jobs . We 're trying to keep everything working . Make sure the pasta is al dente . Fat and flour . Fat and fucking flour . You are homeless . - Shit . You can choose between the gym full of those non infected , and the bus station , or you can come home with me . Tough one . What ? Oh , Jesus ! So all of a sudden we are living together ? Mr. and Mrs. asshole . We can play " Make me special " games . We can play lovers , we could fuck . But you 're just like all the others . Don 't think that you matter , because you don 't . You 're nothing . You 're just passing time . It is not difficult to understand . It 's just fucking ... and eating . And fat and flour . You go out there , you lie down on your back , and spread your legs . Or else take your profound conversation and your emotions and fuck off . You 're just a pair of ears and a mouth . An ass and a cunt . And If I may surprise you to know that everyone else has that , too . A pair of ears and an ass hole . Fat and fucking flour . Nothing special . Accept she is infertile . Fat and flour . Fat and flour ! Fat and fucking flour ! Let me in ! If you are deaf , stay at home . Hang a sheet from your window . Food and water will be delivered . Hello ! Can you hear me ? Pardon ? Have you ever seen anybody else ? I hope you can hear this . Whatever I said to you , I didn 't mean it . It wasn 't me . It was the disease . It was not you . It was not you . It was not me . It 's nobody . Nothing . Nobody is here . Nobody . No . Disease . Which disease ? Where is it ? Where are you hiding , you fucking ... Where are you ? I think you should come back to me . I need you to believe me . It 's me . Why ? Why ? Why ? I need you to come back . I love you . We will keep you informed . Deaf ? Stay at home . This is the safest place to be . Keep your television on . We will keep you informed . Michael ? I was right . Wanna throw some stones ? There are two movements now . There are the people who run through the streets grabbing all they can People who do not believe in anything , but the end of the world . Then , there is the other movement . Farmers going out to milk their cows . Soldiers reporting on duty . Those who believe that life will go on somehow . Or just don 't know what else to do . People prepared for the worse . But hoped for the best . They concentrated to the things that were important to them . All the things beyond fat and flour . Once we thought of the Ice age as something that cracked up , Glaciers slowly spreading . Temperatures gradually dropping . But recently a number of intact mamuts have been discovered full stomachs full of undigested grass . The cold must have hit them like a blow from a cloud . That 's how the darkness descends upon the world . But first , the shiny moments . A shared flinching of the brain 's temporal lobe A profound appreciation of what it means to be alive . But most of all , a shared urge to reach out to one another . To offer warmth . Understanding . Acceptance . Forgiveness . Love . It 's dark now . But they feel each other 's breath . And they know all they need to know . They kiss . And they feel each other 's tears on their cheeks . And if there was anybody to see them , then they would look like normal lovers . Caressing each other 's faces . Bodies close together . Eyes closed . Oblivious to the world around them . Because that 's how life goes on . Like that .

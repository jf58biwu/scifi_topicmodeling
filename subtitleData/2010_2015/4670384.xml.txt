 [ Neck snapping ] Previously on Alphas ... Someone close to us is working with Stanton Parish . You said that you would bring him around to our way of thinking , but you two are farther apart than you 've ever been . Do you understand everything I 'm risking for this ? This is actually pretty friggin ' perfect . I love you . You know that ? Put your hands on your head . I want you to lay face down . - Easy . - You turned her in ! You were supposed to protect her . I just want to forget . I want to disappear . No ! There 's an opportunity here . Eh ... Yes , there is a way out . [ Jet engine whining ] [ Jet taking off ] This is the plea agreement . You need to initial all the boxes that are highlighted , and , uh ... and , yes , sign the last page . The paperwork . Right . Uh , I do hereby solemnly swear to go undercover , cozy up to Stanton Parish , and figure out what he is planning , um ... Ah ! Rat him out . So ... I 'll take it to Cley . - Dad . - Hmm ? Just breathe . Okay ? I 'm a big girl . I don 't need training wheels . Well , there 's a lot more at stake than a skinned knee , Dani . Stanton Parish is a sociopath , you know , he 's- - I know . But he trusts me . I got this . I 'll be okay . Dani missed our last meeting , and hasn 't responded to my check-in signals for over a week . Cley thinks that she may still be loyal to Parish , but I 'm concerned she might be in trouble . So you sent her in there ? You actually sent her back to him ? Doc , don 't you think I should have been brought in on this ? It was for operational security reasons ... - No , no , this is between us . - Right , Dr. Rosen ? - We had an agreement , right ? - No , no , no . Cley insisted , and I agreed . The fewer people who knew , the less risk there would be to Dani . Oh , and keeping Dani safe . That was your first priority , huh ? If she hadn 't agreed to this , Cameron , she would have spent the rest of her life in Building Seven . Or worse . She come up with that brilliant idea herself , Doc , or you head shrink that into her ? - That 's uncalled for , Cameron . - Uncalled for ? Okay , we 're all just trying to wrap our heads around- - You put your own daughter 's head on the block , and I 'm out of order ? You know what ? I 'm starting to think she 's better off with Parish . - Hicks . Please , Hicks . - Rachel . Rachel ! Rachel . Cameron . Cameron , you and I should talk about this . No , we shouldn 't . I did what I had to do to protect my daughter . Really ? 'Cause the way I see it , Dani would have been perfectly safe sitting in Building Seven , while you pulled your little strings to get her pardoned . I couldn 't guarantee that . No , you chose ! You chose to risk her life . You 're using her . Just like you use everyone . [ Elevator dings ] - That is not- - - Get the hell out of my way ! DARPA is saying three intruders . And one of them melted the fence with his hands . Cornell Scipio . I hate that guy . Gary , any word from Hicks ? No , Bill . I left him 14 messages . He should call me back . [ Door opens ] Sir , stop right there ! [ Siren chirping ] [ Motorcycle roars ] Stop right there ! Drop those bags ! - Is that Cam ? - What the hell is he doing ? We 'll meet up at the truck . Go ! Jeff , move your ass ! We are leaving . [ Motorcycle roars ] Hicks ! Hicks ! Unh ! Let 's get in there . What the hell are you doing ? Whatever it takes . Harken , stop ! Hey ! Sayonara , suckers . [ High-pitched tone ] [ Men shouting ] [ Upbeat rock music ] ♪ Alphas 2x09 ♪ The Devil Will Drag You Under Original Air Date on September 24 , 2012 ♪ Don 't say no ♪ ♪ for an answer ♪ ♪ and there 's no telling ♪ ♪ where we 've been ♪ = = sync , corrected by elderman = = ♪ ' cause people don 't understand ♪ ♪ understand , understand ♪ ♪ people don 't understand ♪ ♪ people like me ♪ Well , maybe it 's a protest . Hicks finally had it . That happens . Occupy DARPA , and power to the people . Oh , but that 's--that 's- - that 's not like Hicks , you know ? Doesn 't sound like him . I know , well that 's just- - that 's a theory , though . It 's my theory . Which is the best one so far , 'cause it 's the only one . Look look , it 's gotta be Dani . Nothing else makes sense . Its okay , that 's your theory . Nina , what 's your theory ? Why is he doing this ? I trust him . That 's my theory . Be careful with those . They 're like the fourth of July , but with dead people . - You got it . - It 's a good haul . Almost 100 . What exactly are those things for ? Well , that 's " need to know , " and you don 't . So how do you think Rosen 's people found us ? Probably Gary , and maybe Rachel . Rosen 's been using Alphas to hunt Alphas for as long as I 've known him . If you hate the old man so much , why didn 't you just kill him before you left ? Dani . [ Scoffs ] That 's why you 're doing all this ? Such a romantic . This is what they stole . It 's called a Voltaic Grenade . So what does it do ? It fires off electricity . And if the charge hits power lines , or anything with a live current , it overloads them , setting off a chain reaction . That 's neat . DARPA does make neat things . There 's nothing neat about this , Gary . That electrical storm at DARPA took down three people . That 's off of one of these grenades . And it would 've gotten us too , if we were a few feet closer . If you set just one of these off in the wrong place ... a subway junction box , or anywhere where a bunch of power lines cross ... hundreds of people could die . And multiply that by 60 or 70 grenades , it 's ... it 's a lot of people . Why would Cameron go along with something like this ? Do you have a theory , Dr. Rosen ? And you can 't say that you trust him , or that it 's Dani , 'cause we 've already said those . Well , motives are not what 's important right now . No , preventing Parish from deploying these weapons is . But we need to find Hicks and Dani . Yes , we do . But that 's of secondary importance right now , unfortunately . This is job number one . It 's not just Dani . Rosen , the government , everyone 's trying to control us , like we 're some kind of problem . I want to be the solution . Well , you talk the talk , I 'll give you that . Look , I got Parish his little toys . Tell him to sit down with me , face to face . Well , you 're getting there . There 's something you have to do first . This way . Agnes . This is Cameron Hicks . Hmm . Tall . Stanton thought we should talk . I got nothing to hide . When it comes to Agnes , nobody does . [ Strap cinching ] Sorry I have to tie you down . [ Clears throat ] It 's safer this way . Kinky . You do this to all of Parish 's people ? I 'm the official greeter . Right . So , what are you gonna do ? [ Sighs ] You gonna hypnotize me , or just ask me really nicely ? When I touch someone , it rips open their mind . That doesn 't sound very pleasant . You might want to clench your jaw . Does that help ? No , I just don 't want you to bite off your tongue . [ Exhales ] So , Cameron Hicks . What 's on your mind ? [ Grunting , shouting ] [ Screaming ] [ Muffled screams ] All this time , your dad has been telling us that Parish is the big bad , right ? Everybody else was all about Alpha rights , government oppression , but ... all Parish wanted to talk about was how screwed up the world is , and how Alphas could fix it . Better people , better world . Catchy . [ Grunting ] If you really want answers , I could dig through some old contact numbers . You two could have lunch . Seriously ? You 're cute when you 're confused . [ Grunting ] [ Breathing heavily ] You okay ? Oh , yeah , I 'm great . Thanks . - Try this . - [ Breathes heavily ] It helps . You like your privacy . You have a lot of strong walls in there . Trust me , I am trying to be open . You 're very convincing . I wish I didn 't have to cause you so much pain . Oh , yeah . Sucks for you . It does , actually . [ Breathes heavily ] You can 't turn it off . No . I hurt everyone I touch . You 're lucky . The way you feel about Dani . Not everyone gets that . You know , I met her once . A long time ago . But I have a feeling I 'm gonna see her again soon . [ Sighs ] There 's still something in there . Something ... out of focus . Well , we can 't have that , can we ? Let 's go . - Hey , Gary . - Hey . Isn 't it a little early for your pudding ? No , I can eat it whenever I want . It 's mine . I bought it with my own money . Look ... I know there 's a lot of strangers . Yeah . They 're just here to help us find the grenades . Well ... Hicks was my friend , and- - and Dani 's Dr. Rosen 's daughter . But now that they 're breaking the law , they 're hurting people , now I don 't like either of them . I don 't . Sometimes people do things for complicated reasons . I know it 's painful , believe me . Do you want this ? Do you want my pudding ? I have an extra one . It 's okay . You might need it . Oh , Gary . Gary , listen . Yep . I need you to do me a favor . I need you to look into that DARPA robbery , okay ? The way Hicks was acting , you know ... It 's just not adding up . We don 't know if Hicks is a good person or a bad person , because sometimes people do things for complicated reasons . Yeah , tell me about it . You mind ? No , that 's my bookmark . I 'm sorry , here . How about that ? You 're gonna need a spoon . [ Sniffs ] Maybe not . [ Laughs ] That 's gross , Bill . [ Clock whirring ] [ Groans ] So , did I pass ? Agnes ... gave you top marks . Why the surprise ? Hmm ? You know why I 'm here . Dani . She 's a very special girl . It 's not just Dani . [ Grunts ] Better people , better world . You 're here because of a slogan ? When can I see her ? [ Inhales sharply ] That is not possible right now . But I am glad to see you 're okay , Mr. Hicks . Wait . Where is she ? She 's comfortable . I 'm keeping her safe until I find out where her loyalties lie . Dani 's the one that told me that you 're the good guy , and now you 're saying you don 't even trust her ? Some of her recent actions have shaken my faith . Well , Agnes says that she thinks she 'll be seeing her soon . Did she ? You 'll never know how much I care about Danielle , Mr. Hicks . And I would never want to cause her any pain . But as you just pointed out , it 's seemingly inevitable . Welcome aboard , Mr. Hicks . Get some rest . I 'm heading home . All right . Did you even eat today ? You know , I can 't recall . Those grenades . It 's all my fault they 're out there . At DARPA- - you did your best . No , but I shouldn 't have let- - Nina ... it 's my responsibility . Whatever happens to Cameron , or Dani , or anyone . It 's my responsibility . You shouldn 't have to carry that alone . Yes , I should . [ Sighs ] There 's some hard-boiled eggs in the fridge , and some of that frozen oatmeal that you like . [ Chuckles ] Thank you . Have a good night . Yeah . [ Door closes ] [ Door unlocks , opens ] Stanton . Had a conversation with your Cameron Hicks today . Cam ? Seems he recently joined our cause , I assume to find you . Don 't hurt him . I don 't want to hurt anyone , Danielle . That 's why I 'm here . To give you one last chance to change my mind . [ Engine humming ] You know when I started to doubt you ? When I told you the truth about the world we 're creating . At that moment , there it was . Betrayal in your eyes . No , no , I-I was ... Surprised . Confused . I-I mean , with the things you were telling me , how did you expect me to react ? I expected you to understand . The human race is evolving into something magnificent , but not quite fast enough . 40 years at the most , and then there 's only one possible result . I know . Collapse . That 's a pleasant word for it . A population outstrips the planet 's capacity to provide . Sacrifices must be made . Culling the herd . Stanton , these sacrifices ? You 're talking about killing people . You 're talking about mass murder . If we do nothing , billions will still die . All that will be left will be ashes . But when we succeed , and we will succeed , an ideal world , with resources for all . The human race perfected . Ashes or paradise . Which would you choose ? It 's started , hasn 't it ? That 's why you told me . Just the first step . First of a 100 , a 1,000 . I want you with me . You 're my family . I feel the same way about you . I want to believe you . One must be certain . Agnes Walker will be calling on you shortly . Take her below . [ Engine starts ] All right , people , move ! Out of here now . Make coffee , do whatever the hell you gotta do , but move . What 's wrong ? You need a lawyer . What are you talking about ? - Hicks . - Yeah , he 's gonna arrest you now , ' cause of what you did . We figured it out . You helped him escape , didn 't you ? At DARPA . [ Struggling ] What the hell are you doing ? Whatever it takes . Harken ! No , stop ! [ Echoing ] Let him go . I had him . Then he 's gone . And I couldn 't figure out how . There was- - Something wrong with the timeline . But I figured it all out . Bill lost 6 minutes and 14 seconds . - Bill , just calm down . - No , I 'm not gonna calm down ! You pushed me . Why ? And don 't say that people do things for complicated reasons . That 's not an answer . That 's true . Bill , just come into my office and we 'll talk about this in private . Hell , no . Hell , no . So you can push me again ? You helped Parish get his hands on those bombs , so he could kill thousands of people . - No , no , it 's not like that . - No , shut up ! - It 's not like that ! - Shut up ! You know what ? I did what I had to do , so why don 't you save your self-righteous indignation for when I actually deserve it . - Come here , Nina . - No , screw you . - Come here , Nina . - Screw you ! - No , Doc , Doc , Doc ! - Uh , Bill , Bill- - Please get out of the way . I 'm gonna arrest her this time . Before you do anything , we need to talk . [ Door slams ] You sure you want to do this ? You know better than to question me , Miss Walker . I need to know what she told her father , and what she intends to tell him . Would you like to stick around ? See for yourself ? No . I need to accelerate matters . Deploy grenades tonight . She spooked you . And she was always the one you trusted the most . She made me doubt . We can 't have that . [ Keys jingling , door unlocks ] It 's been a while , Dani . We 're not so different , are we ? We both feel what other people feel . Do you ever hurt them ? The ones you touch ? All the time . [ Crash , grunts ] Cam ! Dani ! Agnes , don 't . [ Gun clicks ] You 're here to rescue her ? I love her . How did you do it ? How did I not see ? Cam . I can still scream for help . I need to know . Please . Please . [ Grunting ] [ Knock at door ] I don 't want to talk to him . Cameron , you 're gonna want to hear what I have to say . This isn 't about you and me . It 's about Dani . We figured out a way to save her . But we need your help . With this adenosine and the other inhibitors , and some careful pushes from Nina , you should be able to resist any sort of probe . Cam ... you 're sure you want to do this ? Ready . Find Dani . [ Heart beating ] Find Dani . Whatever it takes . Whatever it takes . Gah ! [ Breathes heavily ] You did all that ... For her ? I 'll give you ten minutes . Come on . Let 's go . Okay , come on . Come on , move . Where are we going ? What 's next ? No , that 's done , okay ? Your father should have never sent you back to Parish . Now , we 're getting out of here . No . I didn 't come back here for my father . - Dani- - - No , Cam ! I 'm a junkie and a liar . This is my chance to do something good . Parish is planning something that 's gonna kill a lot of people . I can 't walk away . I won 't . Do you know where Parish is right now ? Did you find anything out ? He had me take these grenades that weaponize electrical current . It sounds like he 's gonna deploy them tonight . I heard one of his guys saying something about a--a shipping depot or something . Shipping . Parish has a shipping company in Weehawken . Come on , come on . Let 's go . [ Footsteps ] [ Phone rings ] Hello ? Oh , Dani . Oh , thank God . You should all know that she 's alive . Dani is alive . Cameron saved her . Yay . That 's good news . Yeah . However , Parish 's people are apparently assembling some sort of device , using the grenades , all of them . Wire enough of those together , set them off at the right point in the power system , and ... the main line will carry the blast straight into Manhattan . A million people could die . [ Men shouting in distance ] Tell me what you see , Eddie . A lot of heat in Newark and the main Jersey central lines . Look at that . The concert going on at the Meadowlands is glowing . Focus down . We need to find the most active power conduit leading into the city . Con Ed 23 . Jersey Central , 1A3 . It 's a straight shot into Manhattan . You hear that , Mr. Scipio ? 1A3 . Got it . [ Beep ] We got our target . - Sweet . - Are you ready for this ? Yeah . [ Metal rattling ] Oof ! Ah ! Oh , oh ! Ah ! [ Screams ] [ Bubbling , heart beating ] Cam ! Cam , look out ! Bad ninja ! - [ Groans ] - Cam ! Aah ! [ Panting ] Unh ! [ Power sizzling ] Dani ! [ Screams ] - Let her go ! - Oh-ho ! Don 't go anywhere . Hey , someone wants to talk to you . [ Grunts ] Hey , Kimi ! - [ Struggles ] - Oh ! Dani ! Shhhhh . No , no , Cam . Cam , look at me ! Don 't listen to her ! Cam ! [ Whispers ] [ Muffled , distant ] Cam ! Look at me ! Look at me ! Don 't listen ! Cam ! Come here , you . No , no , no , no , no , no . Cam , Cam , no ! Put it down , put it down ! Put it down , baby . Cam . Cam , look at me . Look at me . You don 't want to do this . Cam ! [ Gasps ] What 's up ? [ Smack ] Oof ! [ Smash , tires screeching ] Oh . Hicks ? Nina ! Help ! [ Smack , crash ] Unh . Hicks ! Come on . [ Echoing ] Hicks , whatever she said , forget it--you don 't want to hurt yourself . Put that down . Hey , you all right ? I 'm okay . Oh , this has all gone so wrong . I 'm sorry . We 've gotta get you out of here . Where are the grenades ? Ah . Where 's Scipio ? [ Engine starts , roars ] - I got this . - Dani ! - Come on ! - I can 't let him go alone . [ Motorcycle turns over ] Dani . We 've been over this . Go . [ GPS beeping ] Almost there . [ Horn blares , tires screeching ] Gary , where 's the truck headed , where 's the target ? Gary , look for the lines carrying the most power into New York . They would have the biggest impact . Well , yeah , I 'm trying , I 'm trying . You gotta try harder , Gary . Come on , partner . Bill , I 'm doing my best , come on . [ Tire skidding ] Get off . Cam ! Unh . Crash . Hicks made him crash . What ? Yeah , on Hackensack Plank Road . - All right , hurry , - Okay . Hey ... Thanks for coming to get me . What else could I do ? Come on . Hey , give me your phone . Damn it . Hey , this is Hicks . Look , I stopped the truck , but Scipio got away . All right , copy . Gary , are you with me ? Oh , no . I 'm at the office , Bill . You 're in New Jersey . Send the DOD to the crash site now , okay ? Anybody else who 's around . Oh , wait . I think I found the target . They 're there , Bill . Dani and Hicks . What ? What are you talking about ? They 're right there . They 're at the target . The crash site is the target . It 's here . They 're planning on setting it off here . Looks like they turned the grenades into some kind of I.E.D. It 's got multiple redundant wires . Hicks , you 're lucky it didn 't blow up when it crashed . It 's got a remote trigger . Listen , Gary . Send the bomb squad right away . Fire , rescue , everybody . The bomb squad 's driving to you right now , but there was an accident on the George Washington Bridge . They 're gonna be 15 minutes getting to you . No , there 's no time ! Look , Gary , what if we could disarm it ? You know , you could talk us through it . Find some kind of database or something . No , I can 't . I 'm busy . I only have two hands . Busy doing what ? I 'm saving the world , Bill . Come on . I 'm using the phone that Skylar gave me to access the power company computers . 'Cause it 's the electricity that kills people , so if I can just reroute the power- - That might actually stop the chain reaction . Gary , how long will that take ? It 's gonna take a while . This is very difficult . You couldn 't do this . Damn it . Parish could set this off whenever he wants . We need time . I can get you time . Give me the phone . Trust me . All right . No . No , no , no . He can 't see you . I got this . [ Cell phone ringing ] [ Beep ] Miss Walker . Hello , Stanton . Danielle . To what do I owe the pleasure ? Take a look . I 'm standing on top of your bomb . If you really care about me ... If I ever meant anything to you at all , just ... let this go . Dani , you 're not supposed to be there . Please step away . I can 't do that . I can 't let you kill millions of people . We 've already been through this . You understand what 's at stake . Just because you 've believed something for a long time doesn 't make it true . [ Beep , beep ] There 's something happening in the grid . Lines are shutting down . Now would be a good time . What if you 're wrong ? What if there 's a way to make the world better without killing anyone ? Danielle ... I wish that were true . I don 't want to hurt you . Please don 't make me do this . [ Car approaching Dani , get out of there ! What are you doing ? Why are you stopping me ? - She 's buying us some time . - What ? Stanton ... you taught me to stand for my principles . You taught me that sometimes , sacrifices need to be made . I listened . My sweet Danielle . Fighting for what she believes in . You are more than I ever could have hoped for . I am so proud of you . You will always be remembered . [ Machinery humming , power whirring ] Run ! Dani ! Dani ! Aah ! Oh ! The lights are still on . I did it ! I diverted the power . We stopped Parish . We won ! Wait--oh , no . You can 't hear me , 'cause your phone went out . Everyone else can hear me , though . Hey ! We saved New York ! We won ! Everyone ... [ Vacuum whirring ] Lorenzo , we won . Lorenzo ! The lights are still on . It didn 't work . No . It did what we needed . It has begun . Unh . Ohh . Is everyone all right ? Rachel ? I 'm okay . - Bill ? - I 'll get there . Go look on the others . Where 's- - Dani . Dani ! Dani . Dani ? Oh , God . Dani ? Dani , come here . Oh . [ Breathing heavily ] Dani ? Dani , it 's daddy . It 's daddy . Can you hear me ? [ Moaning , ragged breathing ] [ Moans ] Daddy . What ? I 'm here . Daddy , I 'm thirsty . Wait . Oh . [ Wheezing ] Dani . Dani , look at me . Look at me . [ Wheezes ] Dani , I love you . I love you so very much . Please , please stay with me . Please , Dani . Cameron ! Look at me . Don 't go . Cameron , she 's ... Can 't somebody do something ? Nina ! Nina ! Do something , please . Dani ? Dani , look at me . [ Wheezing ] [ Echoing ] Do not die . [ Whispers ] Okay , just stay with us . [ Echoing ] Do not die . [ Pulsing hum ] - [ Exhales ] - No . No .

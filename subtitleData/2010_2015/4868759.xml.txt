 Previously on Fringe ... Surgeries that newton performed . He was removing transplanted brain tissue . You nearly died when you were a boy . Walternate found a cureor peter . Walter , peter is dead . I 'm talking about the other peter - The one on the other side . I 'm not from here , am I ? Son - I am not your son . Peter checked himself out of the hospital Three hours ago . He 's gone . Drink that , avoid the radar , You 'll be in oakland in no time . And that is for you , raymond . And your burger should be up in a minute . So ... Where was I ? Well , you were in the middle of telling me How you moved around a lot as a kid , But I got to tell you , Now I 'm hopelessly intrigued with these cds . I 'm sort of known here by the regulars For my playlists . I base my tracks on people 's aura . Well , how often do you think I 'd have to come here To be considered a regular ? I might be able to get you on the list . First , you have to tell me where you 're from . Technically ... I 'm from no place you 've ever heard of . But let 's just say boston . So how long are you here for ? Well , I was just planning on the one night - Passing through . To ? I don 't know yet . Okay ... Peter from boston . I 'll burn you one . Really ? What did I do right ? It 's a long road to " I don 't know yet . " I want to make sure you stay awake out there . And I , uh - I like your eyes . So there 's that . Where are you staying ? I 'm staying at the drake 's bay motel . I 'll drop it by after my shift . Okay , I 'll see you then . I 'll see you then . What are you doing to me ? it may not be the best season For skagit valley 's famous waves of color , But with record warmth , It is still going to be one for the record books . In mount vernon , john hofferste , Q13 , fox news . Your room 's got a bed , you know . What time is it ? 6 : 00 a . M. Did a pretty girl happen to drop by here ? Hello ? Krista ? Hello ? destination . please say a city name . Portland . Portland . Please proceed to the highlighted route . That was obvusly way too easy . Destination . Please say a city name . Mars . Sorry . Please say the city name . How you doing ? I 'm sheriff mathis . This is deputy ferguson . Hi , there . Peter bishop . Were you a customer here last night ? I was . Do you remember your waitress ? Krista , sure . Why , did something happen to her ? Do you have any identification on you ? Of course . Krista told a coworker She was planning to meet you after her shift last night . You gonna tell me what 's going on here ? You first . Yeah , we made plans . But she never showed up . She was gonna meet me at my motel , the drake 's bay , But I just fell asleep in the lobby . You can call the front desk , ask the guy there . Why don 't you just hang here a sec , okay ? where are you goin ' ? Who are you lookin ' for ? Um ... No one . Oh , come on , you got to be kidding me . Krista manning went missing last night . And you talked to her . You two spent some time . I 'd just like to hear about it . I 'd like to do that at the station , okay ? B - I-s-h-o-p . Uh , six feet , brown hair . Officer , I wasn 't staying under the name bishop . I was registered under the name stewart . Yeah , he says he was staying under the name stewart . Right , okay . Thanks , tom . Tom over at drake 's bay Confirms that he was passed out in the lobby all night . Why did you check into the motel Under an assumed name , sir ? sheriff ? This is mathis . Go ahead . Dogs have found a body - The spillway off route 219 and mile marker 8 . White female - coroner 's on his way . Oh , my god . noyo search and rescue , what 's your 20 ? e . T.A. About 45 . Confirm this is recovery , not rescue . that 's right , wes . It 's a bad one . The coroner says the victim Had some sort of operation done to her . A piece of her skull cut out . Over . Sheriff ... Can you let me out of the back of this car ? Just-please , I 'm sorry , But you 're gonna have to be patient , mr . Bishop . Hold on for one second . Hold on . I was listening to your radio . They said that she had a piece of her skull cut out . Is she missing a part of her brain ? I know that that 's a weird question , But you need to ask the coroner Whether she 's missing a piece of her temporal lobe . Please . How the hell did you know that ? You 're f . B.I. , huh ? What exactly is a civilian consultant ? Sometimes people with certain areas of expertise Can offer them to the bureau on a consulting basis . My area of expertise is ... Weird . You mean difficult to explain ? No , I mean the strange , the inexplicable . So , uh ... Can you talk me through this again ? You knew that they took her ... Temporal lobe . Temporal lobe ... Because it 's like a case you worked on before ? Exactly . We were never able to catch those responsible . So that 's why you 're out here . You 're tracking them down ? No . But I think that they may be tracking me down . What 'd they want with you ? I 'm not sure yet . But I thought I saw one of them earlier Outside the crime scene . His name is newton . And I think they called me at the drake 's bay motel . There was no voice on the other end of the line . It was just static , and then a series of strange Noises and clicks - I think they killed krista to find me . By taking her brain ? I told her where I was staying . She 's the only person who knew . Why wouldn 't they just ... Ask her where you were staying ? Or force her . I mean , why cut out her brain ? It 's possible that they needed details about me She didn 't know she had . I 'm sorry . I 'm not following . I know that this is complicated . And I 'm sorry that I can 't give you all the answers , But the case is classified . It is possible , however , that I could show you What I mean . Just give me a minute . I 'm gonna go make a few calls , peter . Of course . Bishop , where are you ? I 'll save you the trace . I 'm in washington state . Look , I need a favor . You 're about to get a call From the noyo county sheriff 's department . They 're checking up on my credentials . are you in trouble ? Mm-mm . In fact , just the opposite . I stumbled into an investigation , And I offered them my services . We 'll ask them to extend you every courtesy . Thank you . Listen ... I don 't want you to tell walter where I am . In fact , I don 't even want you to tell him that we spoke . If you owe me anything , you owe me that . Okay . But , bishop ... If you change your mind , I 'll send someone to pick you up . Thanks . I got to go . Take care of yourself . krista seemed like a sweet girl . Did you know her ? She and my sister went to school together . So explain this to me . The temporal lobe is responsible for memory . So think of the brain as the greatest recording device Ever created . Every sight , sound , smell , All recorded in perfect detail . But imagine that there was a way To get that data out of the brain . So what I said , what I was wearing , What time it was , where I was staying ... I know how it sounds . But believe me , if you can imagine it , It 's possible . If that 's true , If they were trying to find you , Why didn 't they just come for you last night ? I-I don 't know . These are not your ordinary bad guys . The tissue is very pink . Yes , and it 's not normally like that . It only happens when our bodies metabolize adrenaline . So her adrenal 's must have spiked right before she died . Oh ... My god . " find the crack " ? That is the worst police slogan I 've ever heard . It 's not a slogan . In the darkness , There 's always a crack . It 's how the light gets in . Ferguson gave it to me ... Ur first case together . Nobody else thought I could hack it , but ... It 's-it 's an inside joke . It looks expensive . Yeah . That 's what he keeps telling me . If that 's an accurate account of your statement , Please sign it . It is , very . I 'm gonna get a room at the northwest passage . I 'll be staying under the name of ... Gene cowan . So if you need me , that 's where I 'm at . You sure you don 't want a police escort ? no , I 'll be fine . You know , you say that there are people out ther Cutting people 's brains out to find you , And you 're smiling . Look , they may have found me . But now that I know they 're here for sure , I found them too . And now we 're gonna catch ' em . What ? I don 't know about this guy , ann . He knew his way around there . He 's like a medical examiner . He knew the brain , biology , medications . Doesn 't mean he 's legit . You read your books about ufos and roswell And whacked-out theories and government conspiracies . I think that you want to believe . What makes you trust him ? I don 't know . I 'm a good judge of character . I 'm the only one here who likes you . Closed . What do you want ? If you open up , I 'll make it worth your while . Mathis ? What do you want from me ? Peter ... It 's mathis . Who did you tell ? What are you talking about ? Just now , I got one of those phone calls . They know where I 'm staying . And I only told you . I didn 't - Then ask your partner ! That 's what I 'm calling about , peter . Ferguson 's - Ferguson 's disappeared . When was the last time that you spoke with him ? About two hours . He went back to the scene where krista 's body was found . He felt we might have missed something . That means that he disappeared About a half hour before I got the last phone call . You think they used him to find you , Like they used krista . What is it that makes you special ? Why haven 't they taken you ? I don 't know . I don 't even know what it all means , But I do know that these people have the answers . And that 's exactly why I need to find them . All right , then , call your friends at the f . B.I. Let 's get these guys ! No . The f . B.I. Has the expertise . They have the resources . And if we call the f . B.I. , They 're gonna descend on this place , And these people will disappear . I am this close . And I am going to get my answers . You said you got calls at drake 's bay And northwest passage , right ? Yes . Mm-hmm . Well , we pulled those phone records . Those calls never happened . These people can pull memories out of brain tissue . You think they can 't make a couple of calls disappear ? I can do that . People have been doing that since the ' 70s . I understand . You don 't want me to be right , 'cause if I 'm right , Then that means your partner is most likely dead . Hey ... Peter ... With the exception of who you are , I haven 't been able to verify anything you 've said to me . It 's all either classified , or it 's incredible . I 'm calling the bureau . Your partner did disappear . And I did talk to krista . And I did get those phone calls . What if he 's alive ? What if he 's out there somewhere , Thinking I am doing everything in my power , Including calling the f . B.I. , to save him ? Then that is all the more reason For us to find him ourselves . If youake that phone call , We never will . Excuse me , please . Thank you . toaster pastry . Um ... " corn starch , " soy lecithin , Potassium ... Bromate . " Potassium bromate ? This supermarket is trying to kill us ! You ... Potassium bromate - do you know what that is ? Are you okay , sir ? It is known To induce renal cell tumors ... Mesotheliomas of the peritoneum ! Can I call someone for you ? Call someone ? You know what ? You know what you 're putting into our bodies ? Death ! Delicious , strawberry-flavored death ! Okay , okay . I 'm calling security . Yes ! They had no right to make me wait at the police station . It 's the makers of those toaster pastries That should be in jail . let it go , walter . You 're home now , And you 're safe . I wasn 't expecting guests . Walter ... Why didn 't you tell me you needed help ? What am I going to do - Call you every time I run out of pudding pops ? Yes , if you need them . I need to learn to care for myself . If peter doesn 't come back - Walter ... They 'll send me back to the hospital , won 't they ? I won 't let that happen . Thank you . I do ... I do need pudding pops . we don 't know if he made it , But this is the last place he said he was going . Isn 't it protocol for him to call in Once he gets here ? Well ... Sometimes he doesn 't do that . Dummy . Bishop ? Bishop ! Peter . Mathis . What did you see ? I saw newton and one other guy . You didn 't see them too ? They came running right past you . What 's wrong ? What the hell are you doing , bishop ? Put down that gun . Who are you ? Bishop ... Lower ... Your ... Weapon . In the morgue , you dropped something . Who gave it to you ? What is wrong with you ? Answer the question ! My pen ? It was a gift from ferguson , My partner . Why is there blood on your jacket ? There is blood on my jacket Because there is blood on my wrist , Which I got when I fell , running . Show me . I 'm sorry . I needed to know that your blood was still red . What other color would it be ? So these , uh , shape-shifters , They ... Make themselves look like other people ? Yeah , it 's a technology Unlike anything you 've seen before . Peter ... I want to level with you . I , um ... Believe in the unknown . Yeah . " find the crack . " I get it . No , I mean ... I read books about ... Ufos and conspiracy theories . But I do think ... I mean , I am wondering right now ... If you are not completely off your rocker . They were there . I didn 't see them ... Or the dart they shot . I know you didn 't , because they removed it . I know how this must look ... From your point of view - I mean , I was there once too . But ... You just did it . Did what ? You just questioned your own sanity . I 'm not questioning - When was the last time you slept ? I 'm not hallucinating . And I 'm not paranoid . And I 'm not questioning my own sanity . I was wondering why you would listen to me . You 're desperate . Ferguson is more than just your partner , isn 't he ? So there is something between the two of you . You said back at the precinct that ... That I was trying to rationalize That he was still alive . You may be right . I may be doing it right now . He may be dead . But I won 't believe it until I see his body . I can 't . Mathis . You want me to go look ? Sheriff . The victim 's a white female . She has part of her skull missing . I don 't recognize this girl . You never seen her before ? No , I 've never seen her before . Who is she ? I talked to gwynn right before her shift ended . We 'd talked about her coming over last night To help me color my hair . I figured she just got tired . I should have called her . You couldn 't have known . I 'm sorry . Did your sister ever hang out at the hilltop cafe ? Um ... I don 't think so . What about the mosser brothers gas station Out on route 202 ? I filled up there on the way into town . Her pickup 's a diesel , And I don 't think mosser 's carries diesel . Fine , what about the drake 's bay motel ? Would she ever go there for any reason ? Peter ... What 's this about ? It 's just ... Part of our investigation . If you could just write down your address for us . She is grieving , And you are not getting anywhere . * * The hadron super collider is less complicated Than that infernal dishwater . Next time , don 't use laundry detergent , And the dishwasher will work fine . Thank you , astrid . You 're a federal agent . I doubt , during your years of training , That you had dreams of babysitting A helpless old man . You are not that helpless . A little disorganized , maybe . Don 't you usually keep this in the bathtub ? Walter ? I took this little car from the zelazney building . Objects from the other universe like this Emit a glimmer , A distinctive energy signature . It may be possible to detect that signature . So ? So I need you to gather All the objects from the other side That we recovered from the zelazney building And from jacksonville and bring them to the lab . Okay , why ? To build a device to read that energy signature ! Peter emits the same energy , don 't you see ? This is how we will find peter . I must have seen gwynn somewhere , Or she had to have seen me . I mean ... She has to have had some value to them , Some knowledge that they needed . We 'll go to your motel and get your things , Get you something to eat , and ... You can stay at my house tonight . It 's okay . I 'll be fine . You 're my only connection to finding bill right now . I want you safe . What color was gwynn 's truck ? Tan brown . Driver 's side window is rolled down . Glove compartment 's open . Okay , so this girl pulls over her truck , Rolls down the window , And then opens up the glove box . You tell me - why would she do that ? She got pulled over by a cop . Or someone pretending to be a cop-or bill . Pretending to be bill ? Well , these shape-shifters , they take on the appearance Of people in positions of authority . Where you going ? I 'm calling the f . B.I. Why ? First , you said they cut out his brain To find you . Now you 're telling me he may have been shape-shifted ? Which is it , peter ? Did I make a mistake not calling the f . B.I. ? I am very scared right now . Wait , wai-wait . Just hold on for one second . Those people , when they were taken , They must have been afraid , right ? And when they were killed , they must have been terrified . So ? So I know how to find them . Do you know how airplanes have blackboxes ? To record flight data , sure . Yeah , well , human bodies collect data as well . Both krista and gwynn 's muscle tissue Was flooded with adrenaline . Yeah , I remember . Well , the tissue would 've partially metabolized The adrenaline . So we should be able to measure the rate of absorption , Which will tell us when the adrenaline was first produced . What about newton ? How does that help us find him ? Look ... Normally , Your adrenaline levels are flat . Then you experience fear . A spike in adrenaline . Sometime later , you experience more fear , Say , in the moments right before you were killed - Another spike , two points of fear . Now , we already know where the girls were abducted . So if we can just determine how much time took place Between these two intervals ... Then we can figure out where they were killed . Exactly right . There is one more thing . We 're gonna need a control sample . Can you stick that in the centrifuge ? It 's that thing right over there . Ah . Hey ! I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry . I just needed to scare you . I 'm gonna need to take a tissue sample from you . how is dr . Bishop doing ? Walter 's trying to adjust To a very difficult situation . He 's concerned about being sent back to st . Claire 's . Will he be able to function if peter doesn 't come back ? I 'm sure that peter will come back . Do you know something ? Have you spoken to him ? Krista manning 's adrenaline spikes were 42 minutes apart . So assuming that newton drove the speed limit , 60 miles an hour - On these roads , That 'd be a good way to get killed . He would have stuck to 45 . All right , 45 . Okay , the center point is where krista was taken . At 45 miles per hour , The farthest they could have gone Would be 311 / 2 miles . Gwynn , our second victim ... Was taken much farther out of town , Almost on the other side of the county . Her adrenaline spikes are 57 minutes apart . Again , factoring 45 miles per hour ... That 's it . That 's our kill zone . You 're assuming he killed them both In the same place . They were using complex medical equipment . It 's not easy to move an operating room . Much simpler to just bring the victims To a specified location - Someplace out of the way . Like an old dairy farm ? Just ask him something only he would know . Hello , there . It 's , uh , craig , right ? Yeah . I don 't know if you remember , But , uh , I think you were in choir With my sister up at st . Andrew 's . Well , actually , I was at good shepherd . Good memory , though . Yeah , good shepherd - that 's right . So , uh , what can I do for you ? Your old dairy farm up the hill . Could there be people up there ? People ? Yeah , you get up there often ? No , not much , since we shut it down . Why ? Okay , we got 12 outbuildings - The milking parlors , The barn , and the holding stalls . Those are all good places to hide . That 's a lot of ground to cover . I 'll go call backup to help with the search . Need any help with the search ? I think it 's best if you stay here . Let me get you the keys . Sure . Uhh ! Ohh ! Uhh ! Uhh ! Unh ! Uhh ! Uh ! Who are you ? Where 's newton ? Peter , stop ! I couldn 't stop . The girls-I wanted to be close to them . I just couldn 't stop . Where is he ? Where 's ferguson ? What did you do to him ? Bill ? Bill ? Peter ... Bill ! Bill ... He 's still breathing . Thank god . Bill . It 's just ink . There 's no incision here . I 'm gonna go call an ambulance . bill . Stay with me , baby . I 'm here . I 'm here now . I 'm here , bill . I don 't know what to say . You saved bill 's life , And you tracked a killer - what else is there to say ? I wish there was something I could do for you . Whatever your experiences are , Whatever you can 't or won 't tell me about ... I think you 're looking for meaning in things That ... Have no meaning . I don 't know who I am anymore . When I was in college ... My family was killed , murdered . I 'm sorry . Sometimes I still think ... One day I might catch whoever did it . I was alone for a long time . But I found my place . You will too . once we isolate the glimmer , We can find peter . Is the spectrograph ready , agent farnsworth ? Walter , you put in the wrong numbers . No , no , I believe they 're correct . No , they 're not . But , then , you know that already , don 't you ? I thought you wanted to find peter . What if he won 't forgive me , astrid ? All I have now is hope - Hope that he will come to understand Why I did the things I did . What if I find him , and he won 't forgive me ? What do I have then ? Hey . Hey , olivia . Walter ... I found peter . W - where ? He 's in washington state . I 'm heading to the airport now . Would you like to come with me , walter ? I 'll need to pack a bag . * I could sleep * * when I lived alone * * is there a ghost in my house ? * * my house * Peter , peter . Mr. Secretary . Hello , son .

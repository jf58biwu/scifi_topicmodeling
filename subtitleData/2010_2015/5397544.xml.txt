 NARRATOR : Chester 's Mill is a place like any other . At least , it used to be , until we were cut off from the rest of the world by a mysterious dome . [ COW GRUNTS ] Invisible , indestructible , inescapable . We 're trapped . We don 't know where it came from or why it 's here , but now that we 're all trapped under the Dome together , none of our secrets are safe . barbie : I linked up with a bookie . - Taking bets ? Making sure that people paid what they owed . When I get home , you better be gone . You ever consider a career in law enforcement ? BOTH : The pink stars are falling . - Shh . Norrie ? Norrie , where are you ? Right behind you , genius . I didn 't realize that crashing with a farm kid meant that I had to get up at the ass-crack of dawn . - Come on , it 's about the Dome . - Really ? - Is it gone ? Are we finally free ? - You 'll see . I 've been thinking about our seizures . About what we said . " The pink stars are falling . " You figured out what that means ? Not yet , but if the Dome is really sending out messages then we 're like human receivers . We can catch a few transmissions on our own , but when we get too close to each other ... [ FEEDBACK SQUEALlNG OVER radios ] Feedback . Joe , why would the Dome only talk to us ? I don 't know . But when I came out here to find out , I saw this . [ CHUCKLES ] - Oh ... - Yeah , right ? Monarch butterflies aren 't even in season . They shouldn 't be anywhere near Chester 's Mill this time of year . NORRlE : Maybe the Dome sent them . Maybe it 's trying to tell us that the Dome 's just a cocoon and when it finally goes away , we 'll all get to be something new . You realize most caterpillars are actually eaten before they turn into butterflies ? [ NORRlE LAUGHS ] [ DOOR THUDS ] Mr. Rennie . Oh , thank God . What took you so long ? Feeling better there , darling ? Better ? I 've been down here all night . Why haven 't you gotten the police yet ? Mr. Rennie , you 're gonna get me out of here , right ? Of course . Soon as you tell me exactly what it is you 're doing down here . He 's been keeping me prisoner . Who ? Your son . Junior ? No . Why ... ? Why would he do something like that ? Because he 's insane . Please , you gotta get me out of here before he comes back . [ HORN honking ] Big Jim ? Please , please . Listen , I just need to think on this a little bit . No , no , no . You can 't leave me down here . You can 't . You - No , wait ! Wait ! No , help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! No ! Help ! Help ! [ HONKlNG continues ] I thought we were done . What are you doing here ? I received a very troubling message . No , I have to tell you . - What message ? - From the Lord Almighty . He whispered one word to me . - Moab . - Moab ? Moab . You 'd better check the batteries in your hearing aid , because that 's not even a word . No , Jim , Moab was a place . A very wicked place . Much like Chester 's Mill . I 'm warning you , Reverend . Stay away from me . Jim . Ji ... [ static crackling OVER hearing aid ] [ indistinct voice speaking OVER hearing aid ] voice : Moab . Moab . JOE : Over here . NORRlE : Look at them all . Oh , my God , there 's more . NORRlE : Where did they all come from ? They 're so beautiful . Barbie ? What is this ? Isn 't it amazing ? Huh . These guys are suddenly paying attention to us ? NORRlE : Look , they 're bussing in more soldiers ? No , civilians . - Hey , that 's Frank . NORRlE : Who ? My cousin . He went away to college before the Dome came down . It 's been nearly a week since this thing came down . Military hasn 't let anybody near here . So why bus the families in now ? Haven 't you ever been to camp ? They 're finally giving us our own Visitors ' Day . We have official confirmation from military representatives that at 10 : 00 a. m. this morning , the people of Chester 's Mill will be permitted to visit with their loved ones on the outside . The location for this is where the Dome intersects with the Sixth Street bridge . For further updates , stay tuned to WYBS . [ DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES ] - We need to talk . - No , I know . You heard the news ? The feds are bussing in people who got caught outside the Dome . What ? Yeah , they just started coming in this morning . The press too . Well , you 're gonna need help with crowd control . Linda 's already talking about bringing in some more deputies . The time for talk is over . I 'm authorizing you to recruit auxiliary officers . - Dad , I - - How about Carter ? The fullback from your year ? I should get some supplies first from the old shelter . When I tell you to do something , Junior , what do you do ? - Dad , I know - - Now ! Shouldn 't we get your moms ? Why ? It 's not like any of their phony L.A. friends are gonna make the trip . Yeah , but you never made it to where you were headed . Someone out there 's probably worried . NORRlE : Ugh . Who cares ? I 'm just excited to meet your folks . I can 't wait to tell them you 're shacking up with an underage girl and two lesbians . [ CHUCKLES ] Barbie . I could use your help . We need to keep people a safe distance from this thing . We don 't want people 's cameras or cell phones blowing up like Duke 's pacemaker . String this up . Till we find out what the hell this Dome is , I don 't want anyone on our side touching it , no matter what . Got it . MAN 1 : Hey . WOMAN 1 : Hi , Mom . MAN 2 : Hey . WOMAN 1 : I love you . MAN 3 : There he is . WOMAN 2 : Hi . Alice . I miss you so much . WOMAN 3 : Miss you . MAN 4 : How are the kids ? MAN 5 : They 're fine . soldier : Get away from the Dome . You two , back up . Out of the way . Keep going . Captain , keep those people back . Is it true ? They 're letting us see our families ? - Yeah . - Really ? Hey , did Dodee pick up any chatter about this ? No . I 've been listening to her E.T. phone-home thing , but the military broadcast dropped out last night , so all we 've been getting are random numbers and crap . [ BEEPlNG THEN static humming OVER SPEAKERS ] MAN : Zone 1 is painted . Green for 1315 . Zone 1 is painted . Green for 1315 . - What does that mean ? - Who cares ? Getting visitors is the first good news we 've had since ever . WOMAN : - where a global audience awaits any hint of what 's happened ... Do you think he 'll show up today ? Peter ? - Julia , I - - Phil , it 's all right . Barbie told me what you guys were into . I know my husband left me because he has a gambling problem . But that was before all this . He 's gotta show his face today , doesn 't he ? JEFF : This is Jeff Glor . - Yeah , I - It 's been five days since the invisible barrier arrived over Chester 's Mill . That doesn 't sound like another Army guy . - the military evacuated surrounding towns and established a ten-mile perimeter around what 's being called " the Dome , " the world has been waiting for news from inside . Last night , the government relented , allowing select members of the press to document these emotional reunions . Ladies and gentlemen , as you approach the Dome , make sure that if you have a tablet in your hand that you do not touch the Dome . I repeat , do not touch the Dome . RUSTY : Look , we 're famous . They wanna make a reality show out of us . I know . [ inaudible dialogue ] NORRlE : Who are you looking for ? - I 'm looking for Angie . You said your sister 's a flake . Yeah , she is , but she 'd definitely come to this . What the hell ? Nore ? No . My mom said I came from an anonymous donor . JOE : That 's your mom . Sinners ! Over and over , the Lord has spoken one word in my ear , Moab . Why ? Because we are Moab . [ ringing OVER hearing aid ] - Moab ! jim : Okay , thank you , Reverend . Thank you for those inspiring words . Enjoy your loved ones . So help me , God . If you ruin this day for these people , I 'm gonna - What , beat me to a pulp ? In front of the congregation ? I 'm not scared of you anymore , Jim Rennie . All I fear is the wrath of my Lord . And the only way we 're gonna be spared his fury is if we confess our sins . - Sins ? - Yeah . We saved Chester 's Mill . We helped drug dealers make their poison . We never let them sell it here . It 's not my fault you dipped into their supply . All you ever think about is fattening your own coffers . - Damn it , Lester , you listen - - No , you listen to me . You may have fooled some of these people into thinking you 're some kind of leader , but nobody 's gonna follow you anywhere , ever , when they hear just exactly who you are . What do you want , Reverend ? For you to admit your sins before God and every man and woman in Chester 's Mill . You have one day . One day to come clean , or I do it for you . JEFF : It is the final hour of the government 's first Visitors ' Day . Families under ... Hey . That 's my sister . - Linda . - Hey . Any sign of your husband ? Not yet . What about you ? Did you find your fianc√© ? Yeah . Everything all right ? I just couldn 't bring myself to tell him . About what ? His brother . Linda , Freddy 's death was an accident . He got shot on my watch . It 's my responsibility to tell Rusty . I just ... I just don 't know how . Yeah , you do . - Hey . - Hey . Norrie ? Norrie . Where the hell have you been ? Michael ? So it 's true , this guy 's my dad ? Norrie , it 's complicated . No , you told me the records were sealed . That we couldn 't even look for him . And all these years , you 've been lying to me . How dare you ? You have never been anything to this girl . But the second that cameras show up you decide you suddenly have a daughter ? - Alice , take it easy . - I hate you . I hate you all so much . alice : Norrie . - Alice . julia : Barbie . Have you seen him ? Peter . I know that nothing that I 'm gonna say is gonna make up for the fact that I should have told you the truth sooner . You 're right . But I don 't blame you for my husband 's bad decisions . And if you really wanna make it up to me , just keep an eye out for him . Excuse me . Sorry . Mary . MAN : That 's what they 're saying . I don 't know . [ inaudible ] Thank you . Hey , what 's the matter ? That was my sister-in-law . What did she say ? She showed me a letter that she got from my husband . It said , " I know this is confusing , but all I can say is sorry . Tell Julia she deserves better . " Guy didn 't even have the balls to send his own Dear John letter . I love you . WOMAN [ crying ] : This thing brought you back to me . Oh , my God . I can 't believe it . Thank you so much for coming . - It means the world to me . - Ma 'am . They don 't want anyone touching this thing . That 's my son . I haven 't spoken to him in almost 10 years , - but here he is . - I 'm sure . Yeah . - This thing brought him back to me . - I understand , but we 've - junior : Hey . - Leave her be . - You gotta be kidding me . Somebody made you a cop ? We 'll take it from here . [ inaudible ] I have to tell you something . It 's about your brother . No . I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry . [ SNlFFLlNG ] JOE : Norrie , wait . - I don 't wanna talk about it . - What did your dad say ? - He 's not my dad . He 's just some creep who wants to be on TV . Look , I 'm sorry . I just always imagined that maybe I 'd get to meet a part of my past and never really pictured it going quite like that . BEN : Yo , McAlister . JOE : Ben . Were you at Visitors ' Day ? Yeah , but pretty much everyone I actually like is stuck in here with us - so I just talked to random strangers . - About what ? Did you hear China threatened to attack us after the Dome showed up ? Seriously ? Yeah , this guy said Beijing thought we were testing some kind of illegal super weapon , so the president had to talk them off the ledge , tell them we didn 't even build it . Great . Sounds like the grown-ups have it all under control . soldier : Excuse me , ma 'am ? Excuse me . Can you read lips as well as you do sign language ? Maybe . What 's in it for me ? Answers . DODEE : You know this guy ? barbie : No . My old unit 's kind of famous . Do me a favor . Just tell me what this guy 's saying . " It 's an honor to meet one of the Jackrabbits , sir . How are things in there ? " barbie : Forget about us . What 's happening out there ? [ inaudible ] She can read lips . You 're good to go . DODEE : " Something big is going down . They told us to pull out after this . All of us . " - What ? - No clue . But they said once we leave ... " But they said once we leave don 't plan on coming back . " Sorry , sir . We 're on the move . No . Wait , wait , wait . [ inaudible dialogue ] " Last night . After the butterflies showed up . " Butterflies ? Yeah , there was a whole swarm of them . It covered part of the Dome . Huh . - What ? - A lot of insects use magnetic fields to navigate . If the Dome is altering them , then - There is no way in hell the government would stand for that . They 're not about to let this thing mess with the outside world . Well , what does that mean ? - Moab . - Come again ? What your reverend was ranting about . His hearing aid must have intercepted a transmission like the ones you 're picking up at the radio station . But why would the Army be telling Bible stories ? Moab is not a city , it 's an acronym , MOAB , Mother of All Bombs . That 's what we call the largest non-nuclear missile in our arsenal . You think they 're gonna launch that thing at the Dome ? - Would it work ? - Yeah . Then why don 't you look happy ? Because it 'll also kill everybody inside . What ? Dodee , Visitors ' Day was not about saying hello to your families . It was about saying goodbye . How 'd it go with Rusty ? As well as it could , I guess . He left without even saying goodbye . Still , I 'm glad I told him . So thank you . Councilman Rennie . We 're dead . It 's coming down . Whoa , slow down , Dodee . What are you talking about ? What 's coming down ? The Army is gonna blow up the Dome , even if that means blowing us up with it . That can 't be true . I just got the word from a soldier on the other side . They 're gonna launch a thermobaric missile right at us . - Good Lord . Any idea when ? - I guess as soon as they evacuate everyone from the outside the Dome , but , no , I don 't have a timetable . I think I do . At the radio station this morning , Phil and I heard something , " Zone 1 is painted green for 1315 . " Yeah , " painted " means that a target 's been approved . Zone 1 was written on all the trucks , so it 's gotta be Chester 's Mill . - And 1315 ? barbie : Military time . That 's 1 : 15 this afternoon . - That 's less than three hours . - So that 's it , we 're all just gonna die ? No . No . We get everybody to a shelter . - Where ? - The old cement factory . Some of those tunnels run pretty deep . So what , we relocate the entire town ? What about the sick , the elderly ? I 'll dispatch a fleet from the lot to help with transport . - Let 's do it the best we can . - All right . Hurry . I 'm so sorry , sweetie . I still haven 't seen Angie . Maybe she 's volunteering at the clinic . We just checked there . They haven 't seen Angie since the first Dome day . julia [ OVER radio ] : This is Julia Shumway with an emergency broadcast . I know this news might be difficult for many of you to accept , but I give you my word that it is the truth . At 1 : 15 p. m. today , the military plans to launch a powerful missile at our town in the hopes of destroying the Dome . - Did she say missile ? - Listen . - it is imperative that we take shelter . For your safety , all residents of Chester 's Mill must go to Sanders Cement Works immediately . Please do everything you can to help spread the word . This is not a drill . Mr. Rennie . [ angle GASPS ] [ GRUNTS THEN PANTS ] I can 't apologize enough for what Junior did to you . He was a good boy . I don 't know where I lost him . Anyway , you can go now . Why are you doing this ? Well , if we 're all gonna die today , you might as well die a free woman . julia : We 're working on the lights , sweetheart , okay ? So it won 't be dark for too much longer . And we 'll get you a cot as soon as we can , okay ? Hey . You almost finished battening down the hatches ? Yeah . For what it 's worth . Julia , when that missile breaks through here - I know . Hey , Dodee told me how you got the story . Said the soldier started talking when you showed him some sort of a coin ? I 'm not asking on the record . Just you and me . That guy that we met , he probably only talked to us because he thinks that I 'm some kind of hero . You 're not ? One of my deployments in Iraq , my unit helped rescue a captured soldier from insurgents after her company had been killed by small-arms fire . God . The insurgents captured that soldier . They didn 't kill her company . We did . We were on patrol , and all of a sudden someone starts shooting at us , and it 's not until the dust clears that we realize we 'd just shot up our own side . Killed every soldier except the one that the enemy hauled off . Maybe this is how I deserve to go . More friendly fire . [ DOOR OPENS ] jim : Junior . Dad . What are you doing here ? You first . I heard about the missile . I figured maybe we could go take cover in the old bomb shelter . I know , Junior . - What are you talking about ? - About Angie . I let her go . You did what ? What the hell were you thinking ? I mean ... Junior . That doesn 't matter anymore , Junior . It didn 't matter - Junior , we just need to get down to that factory . The town needs us , Junior . Junior ! Junior ! Phil , it is way past go time . Hurry it up . Hold on . I 'm setting up a playlist to broadcast right after we leave . I just have to play one last song before this thing hits . This is probably the very last thing anyone 's ever gonna hear , okay ? But I thought we were gonna be safe in those tunnels . From weapons of mass destruction ? So you think this is gonna be the end ? Thirteen minutes , we find out . Hello ? Joe ? Joe ? Joe ? Where the hell is everybody ? Joe ! [ GASPS ] I knew you 'd come here . We 're not finished yet . Just find a place somewhere over there , okay ? Hey , how 's everything out there ? Under control . I think I got the last of the holdouts . Where 's Junior ? Just tying up a few loose ends . Make sure your new guys keep the peace in here . - Where you going ? - Tying up a few loose ends . [ classical music playing OVER SPEAKERS ] Phil . Beethoven ? Keeps the folks mellow . Got something for you . phil : What are you doing ? It 's your watch . It 's my grandfather 's watch . Yeah , I figured it probably had some sentimental value . I bet on the Browns , Barbie . That 's losing fair and square . Well , maybe I 'm getting out of that line of work . Good luck , Phil . junior : I got you this in the fourth grade , remember ? When my parents took me to New York ? Junior , what 's happening ? julia [ OVER radio ] : This is a prerecorded emergency broadcast . At 1 : 15 p. m. today , the military plans to launch a powerful missile at our town , in the hopes of destroying the Dome . What does that mean ? We 're all gonna die . - Junior , you don 't - - Yes , I do . From the very beginning . I 'm so sorry , Ange . All I wanted to do was to help you to get better . I 'm sorry . [ classical music continues playing ] Last call ? An editor gave me this bottle after my first byline . Been looking for a good excuse to drink it ever since . - Was it worth the wait ? - It 's horrible . My bosses always hated me . You know , I still miss Chicago , but Peter always said I 'd grow to love this place . Where do you think he is now ? Some flophouse in Vegas ? Oh , Julia . Well , I made my peace with it . Besides , maybe he was right . You know , I didn 't understand this place before the Dome came down . But now , after everything we 've been through , I 'm glad I got to be a part of it . Julia , there 's something that you need to hear . - You don 't have to say anything . - You don 't understand - alice : Please . We need help . - Has anyone seen our daughter ? alice : Our daughter , Norrie . She 's tall , she 's got red hair . - Has anyone seen her ? - Alice ? - Yes . - I saw your daughter at Visitors ' Day . So did we , but then she took off . And we haven 't seen her , or her friend Joe , since . I 'm going back out there . No way . Dome 's about to come crashing down on all our heads . Our girl is still out there . Sorry , you 're not gonna be able to leave . CAROLYN : No , you do not understand - - Where you going ? - When I followed Junior down here a few days ago , we found another way out . We gotta find those kids . - Angie ? - Angie ? Angie ? - Angie ? - Ange ? - You should go back to the shelter . - No , I wanna stay with you . You should be with your moms . They 're your family . But you 're my friend . All right . Come on . [ SKEETER davis ' " THE END OF THE WORLD " playing ] You played this ? Skeeter Davis . She is a legend . - Can I say something , Phil ? - Anything in the whole world . I hate you . - Yeah ? - Mm-hm . I hate you too . We 're too late . [ panting ] What are we gonna do ? [ explosion rumbling IN distance ] All right , everybody , stay put and remain calm . I 'm gonna get some answers . [ rumbling STOPS ] - How - ? - When we touched , we didn 't have the seizures . More importantly , we didn 't die . jim [ OVER radio ] : Linda ? Linda , come in . What 's the word , Jim ? I 'm not sure yet , but everyone 's okay . [ SOBS ] [ laughing ] [ DOME BUZZES ] [ sighs ] He saved us . What the hell are you doing here ? Hell 's got nothing to do with it . God told me to come out here . To see the moment of our salvation for myself . - Lester - - The good Lord saved Chester 's Mill because I repented . And now it 's time for you to do the same . Jim , I know you think this town belongs to you , and maybe it used to , but today ... Today 's a new day . This Dome has only one master , and we are all his servants . You know , you 're right , Reverend . Today is a new day .

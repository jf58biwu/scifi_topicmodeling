 The dreams returned last night . Stranger . More vivid than ever . I dreamt of his world . The world that used to be . Before the Votans arrived . _ I was born in to the world that came after . After the vessels that carried my people were destroyed . After the Arkfalls began . After the terraformers changed his planet forever . The Earth he once knew was gone . Dead is the star system my people left behind . When I was a child , Nolan liked to tell me : " This world has no natives , which means it belongs to everyone . " He says Antarctica will be paradise . I wanna believe him but ... I 've been disappointed too many times . I love my father , but his promises usually turn to stahko . So is this the silent treatment or is this just little more silent than usual ? Confused , maybe you can give me a little hint . You know . Nod , twitch , breathe ... Yep , yep , yep . Matching approach vector , I see it . Look , how was I suppose to know she was married ? It 's not like they wear rings or anything . It 's all weird alien pheromones , and quite frankly I wasn 't born with a nose for it . Never again . I will never again involve you in a compromising situation like that . I promise . Projected impact- - 20 clicks . Finally , guaranteed payday . ♪ We got married in a fever , ♪ hotter than a pepper sprout , ♪ We 've been talkin ' ' bout Jackson ♪ Ever since the fire went out . ♪ I 'm goin ' to Jackson , ♪ I 'm gonna mess around ♪ Yeah , I 'm goin ' to Jackson , ♪ Look out Jackson town . ♪ Well , go on down to Jackson ; ♪ go ahead and wreck your health . ♪ Go play your hand you big-talkin ' man , make a big fool of yourself , ♪ Yeah , go to Jackson ; ♪ go comb your hair ! ♪ Honey , I 'm gonna snowball Jackson . ♪ See if I care . ♪ Well now , we got married in a fever , ♪ hotter than a pepper sprout , ♪ We 've been talkin ' ' bout Jackson , ever since the fire went out . ♪ I 'm goin ' to Jackson , ♪ and that 's a fact . ♪ Yeah , we 're goin ' to Jackson , ♪ ain 't never comin ' back . Let 's see what we can salvage . We 're clear . Hundreds of years in space , only to die in their sleep . Come on . Oh yeah . Look at that Terra-spire there . Not even a dent . Looks intact . You got the whatsit ? Let 's see if we can jump start this sucker . Bingo . What 's it worth ? Earth Republic pays top jaja for Votan tech . Pristine Terrasphere like this ... - Three million easy . - So we 're rich ? Oh yeah , we 're rich . We can pay off Varus ! With enough left over for passage to Antarctica . It 's gonna be you and me kiddo , lying on a beach from now till the Arks rise again . Suhri , Nuganma , Hajixa , Suhri ... Spirit Riders . Better stay- - _ _ _ _ Because you people smell like stahko . _ _ _ _ _ Enough ! You ... - Outside . - Okay . _ _ Hey ! Hey , c 'mon guys ! _ You know what we went through to get that ? Ooh , pretty , pretty . Hey ! Hey ! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Go ! Go ! What about our roller ? Forget the roller . _ C 'mon , keep moving . There 's things in these woods we don 't want to meet . Okay , there 's a settlement in this direction . Alright , I saw it on the scanner , but ... I don 't know how far . - We should rest . - No , keep going . - Irisa , what 's wrong ? - I 'm shot . Oh , c 'mon . Now this is gonna hurt , okay . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . That 's my girl , c 'mon . Alright , big boy . C 'mon . Souch . - Be gentle with her . - You 're safe with us . - Drop the net , we 're coming in . - Roger that , stand by for entry protocol . That arch . - Is this St. Louis ? - Once Now we call it Defiance .

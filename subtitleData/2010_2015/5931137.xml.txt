 A few weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down on Chester 's Mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . Why the dome is here or what mysteries lie ahead we still don 't know . Every day it tests our limits , bringing out the best and the worst in us . Some say we 'll be stuck here forever , but we will never stop fighting to find a way out . - Julia , let go of the rope ! - I got you ! Julia , I can 't hold it ! What if the dome dug it ? That cliff and Barbie going down there - was all part of the dome 's plan ? - Plan for what ? I waited outside that school . I saw you leave with Barbie . He never left . So where is he ? And do not lie to me again . Barbie 's dead . You need to see this . I think it 's a playground . - Where ? - The obelisk . There 's something you should know . Melanie 's alive . Dale ? Oh , my God , it is you . Hi , Dad . I need to get a message to somebody inside . - Who ? - It doesn 't matter . Obviously it does , or you wouldn 't be here . - You 're up early . - Comes with the new job . I wanted to give you that . - What 's this for ? - Safety . I found a bunch of them in a closet at the station . I just wanted to give them out to , you know , key people at key locations . So I 'm a key person . You 're our resident scientist . Mm-hm . And who do I call if someone , say , uh , breaks into my house ? I 'm sorry about that . I really am . I can 't explain it . I just ... I get overzealous . Heh . That 's what you call it , huh ? I really am sorry . So you 're planning on keeping that star , huh ? Yeah . Dome hasn 't treated those who wear it too kindly . I know . It 's just , I feel like the dome has something else in store for me . I 've just been too lucky to ignore it any longer , you know ? This new Big Jim , you 're serious ? I 'm trying to be . Keep that on Channel 2 . Just give me a call if you have any problems . - Jim ? - Yeah ? Thank you . You 're welcome . - Hey , morning , Dale . - Morning . You , uh , figured out a way to get me to the dome yet ? That 's a pretty tall order , son , but I 'm still working on it . But I can get an e-mail to Julia if you want . You can do that ? Made some calls to my friends in the military . Days ago when the dome went white and then cleared again , the signal was able to get through . - But then they firewalled it . - Yeah , but they 'll drop it for me . Privilege has its perks . Yup . Why don 't you write down what you wanna say and where you wanna send it ? " Julia , I love you . We 'll see each other soon . All it takes is a leap of faith " ? Yeah , I 'm just trying to keep her spirits up . And this is the address you wanna send it to . ScarecrowJoe . - Is that hers ? - No , that ... That 's a kid that she 's friends with . He 's kind of a computer nerd . But he 's got the best chance of seeing anything that comes through . Julia must be pretty special to have so many people looking out for her . Thank you , Dad . Am I in focus yet ? - Is there enough light ? - Why are you trying - to break your neck ? - First rule of show business . Gotta open big . Ta-da , welcome to my vlog . Video blog ? Is there , like , a Chester 's Mill film festival sometime soon ? No , it 's so everybody will know what it 's like living inside this stupid dome . Even though we can 't post it because we don 't have a Wi-Fi signal anymore . Maybe somebody will find it one day , long after we 're gone . - Joe , don 't say that . - Well , it could happen . - You don 't have to be morbid about it . - Because that 's what you do . Just tell me where we 're going . We 're going to the tunnel underneath the school and the cliff . That connects to a playground . Yeah , which is super weird . But you 're with me , right ? - Yeah , I 'm with you . - Great . As long as you don 't do any more gymnastics moves - while we 're down there . - Ha , ha . - What was that ? - It 's my phone . Oh , my God . The signal 's back and there 's an e-mail . - You need to eat , Julia . - I can 't . Was up all night thinking about Barbie . Julia , you 'll never believe this . - He 's right . I barely did . - Believe what ? Okay , we were at the school filming a vlog . I know , there 's no way to send them out , but I make them so people will know about us . Out of nowhere this Wi-Fi signal came back . And Barbie sent you an e-mail . - What ? - Can you believe it ? We thought he was dead and now he could be alive . And he sent me an e-mail ? Well , he sent it to me , but it was for you . " Julia , I love you . We 'll see each other soon . All it takes is a leap of faith . So get the egg and bring it with you . Barbie . " Why aren 't you more excited ? Yeah , going over that cliff must be the way out of Chester 's Mill . How do we even know it 's him ? He doesn 't say anything to prove that it is . Where the hell is he ? The egg showed us Zenith last night . Maybe that 's where the cliff leads . Julia , why are you doubting this ? I would be doing cartwheels if I was you . - Joe , can we send a reply ? - I don 't know if the signal is still up at the school . As soon as we got it , we ran here . Okay . Let 's go . It 's in the cards . It 's in the cards . It 's in the cards . Yesterday , he was saying " Melanie " over and over again . Today , " it 's in the cards . " - It 's in the cards . - What does it mean ? - Good luck finding out . - Are you going somewhere ? - Anywhere . - No , you cannot leave . Pauline , I got out of Chester 's Mill . This is my chance to start my life over . - You can come with me . - No , not until I get Junior out . We have got to go in there and help him . - What ? You 're crazy . - Don 't call me that . What I mean is I don 't know how I got here . One minute I 'm next to a cliff underneath Chester 's Mill . The next , I 'm lying in a playground here . I looked around for a door or a passageway , nothing . Well , if you got out , there 's gotta be a way in . Maybe he knows . Lyle doesn 't even know his own name . But he got through like you did . And there are doctors here helping patients with a new drug . It 's experimental . I asked them to try it on Lyle . He doesn 't fit the protocol . - End of story . - You 're an EMT . - You can find a way to give it to him . - Pauline . I know you love Junior . We have got to get him out . - Mike , wait ! - I 'm coming . I 'm coming . Hey , what are you doing ? Ha , ha . I 'm wondering the same thing myself . I 'm just waiting here hoping a friend shows up to meet me . Is that ... ? Gotcha . We can go up this weekend ... I don 't know what ... Is there any way ? Your first time tailing someone ? - Actually , yeah . - Yeah , it shows . - Who are you ? - All that matters is who you are . Dale Barbara , born July 17 , 1979 , third in your class at Zenith High , joined the Army November , 2005 . Captain , Fifth Group , Special Forces ... You got the wrong guy . You also just escaped from the dome . I don 't know what the hell you 're talking about . If I know you were under there , you can be sure other people know too . - Like who ? - Your dad . What 's he got to do with this ? He doctored your e-mail to Julia . Told her to bring the egg when she took her leap of faith ... Tell me who the hell you are . Look , would you ease up ? - I 'm a friend . - I don 't have any . - You need one . - Well , it ain 't gonna be you . Well , I 'd think twice about heading back to that playground . There are eyes everywhere in this city . How do you know about that e-mail ? Let me show you . - Did you find a signal yet ? - No . But this is where you were when the e-mail came through ? Yeah , right about here . Well , right about here or right here ? You have to know exactly , Joe . Yeah , right here . But the signal 's gone . I 'm sorry . Yeah , me too . The man I love is dead . I watched him go over that cliff . Now I 'm just supposed to believe he 's somehow alive ? He said to take a leap of faith . That must mean it 's safe for you to jump off that cliff . I don 't even know that it 's him . If it is , I 'll do whatever he wants . You 'd even take the egg ? I 'd jump in a second . I 'd do anything to see my parents , let them know I 'm okay . Tell them about Angie . Joe , we all wanna get out of here . Just listen to Julia . We have to get an e-mail back . We have to make sure it 's Barbie . There 's no signal . Maybe we can get him a note . If that cliff is really the way out of here , he will be waiting wherever it leads . Like a message in a bottle , with a question that only he can answer . So figure out what you wanna say to him . Art room , Judy 's having a seizure . She needs help . This is a police-only area . Whatever councilman do , they do upstairs . I 'm no longer a councilman . You 're joking . If I was joking , one of us would be laughing . Isn 't being sheriff a little low on the totem pole for you ? Look , protection of this town has always been my first priority . Now that Barbie 's gone , someone has to wear the star . Just , uh hope I can live up to it . - Still a politician at heart . No , I 'm not . Things are different . The dome has revealed it has plans for me . So now you think the dome speaks to people . I 'm sorry I didn 't believe you when you said it , son . Look , if I 'd understood , you know , everything , - maybe I could 've protected Angie . - Don 't use her to sell me on this . Look , I 'm just saying I have made mistakes . I should 've put my trust in family , first and foremost . I should 've trusted you , son . Big Jim , you there ? - Yeah , Rebecca . What ? - Not sure exactly , but we got a problem at the Sweetbriar . - Police need to see this . - Okay , be right there . Why don 't you hold down the fort ? I 'll go check this out . Why don 't I come with you ? Show the department 's new employee the ropes . After you . What can we do for you ? What 's going on , Rebecca ? I went to check on the windmill and someone had cut it down . I kept searching for it , and found it here . Who the hell would destroy this thing ? Especially after it saved us all from choking to death a few days ago . Someone 's trying to send me a message . - Not everything 's about you , Dad . - Well , it 's gotta mean something . - Hello , police ? - Yeah , it 's Junior . What 's going on ? There 's a fire at Maple and Thornton . - We need help . - Be there in a sec . You in , Barbie ? Yeah , I 'm in . Hey , if this is a setup , you 're gonna have a hell of a time picking up your teeth with broken fingers . I get it , you 're tough . Just get to his computer and put in the jump drive . It 's password protected . Put in the jump drive . House security makes their rounds every two minutes . How long is this gonna take ? About that long . - I take it you 're not in gardening . - I 'm in computing , but don 't worry . I 've been seeing that graffiti around town . It 's my website to tell the world it 's being lied to about the dome . Okay , I 'm there . Can you see that box up top ? - Type in the code " dromas . " - Dromas . - Uh , I might 've screwed something up . - Nope . Go ahead and take the jump out , and I 'll take it from here . Here 's the real e-mail your father sent her . So " Julia , I love you . We 'll see each other soon . All it takes is a leap of faith . So get the egg and bring it with you . " Oh , my God , he did change it . Now do you believe me ? What does my dad want with the egg ? - Yeah , what is that thing ? - I can 't let Julia jump . What are you doing ? - Not every day I get a backstage pass . - No . I 've got everything that I needed . - Yeah . Relax , Barbie . - We 're done . Get out of there . What the hell ? - I could ask you the same thing . - Hey , Dad . Stall him . Son , what 're you doing in here ? Nothing . I was just trying to check my e-mail . See if Julia replied , but I couldn 't log in . Well , she wouldn 't have replied . Yeah , no , I know , it 's a military firewall , but I was just hoping there 's a chance . Oh , look at this . This photo . I love this photo of Mom . Where was this taken ? The lake house . - On our anniversary . - Right . Come on , come on . Yeah , see ? Like I said , wouldn 't let me log in . I just wish there was a way to get her another message . Dale , I need you to come with me . I was stepping out to get some supplies for the diner and spotted the car wild with fire . Thank God you gave me this walkie . Yeah , you did a good job , Andrea . Thanks . We 'll take it from here . People in this town are losing it . - Or someone 's on a vandalism spree . - You 're still not seeing the pattern ? First they hit the windmill that I put up , now under a sign for my dealership , they torch a car . A car that I sold . You 've sold two-thirds of the cars in town . It 's not a coincidence , son . Technically , two events are a coincidence . Takes three to make a pattern . Well , I 'm not gonna wait till that 's my head on a platter . It 's the only lead we got . Follow it . Haven 't been here in a while . The company 's grown a lot . I haven 't been entirely truthful with you . About ? The message you had me send to Julia ? It went to her , but not through the military . It came from here ? Aktaion Energy has other divisions . Satellite imaging , telecommunications . You 're a government contractor . After the dome came down , we were hired to monitor radiation levels . But we were the first to discover a way to get a Wi-Fi signal into the dome . Which you then shared with your friends in the military . For a healthy profit . But we kept a back door as a way to be able to use it ourselves . That can 't be legal . No , which is why it was a huge risk for us to send that message . And the one we 're about to send . Oh , he 's not here . Yes , I am , sir . Oh , Hunter May , meet my son , Dale . How are you ? Nice to meet you . Ahem . Yeah , likewise . We need you to work your magic . Send one more message into the dome . Dale will dictate it to you . All right . Well , fire when ready . What did you decide to ask him ? If he remembers who he caught going through his stuff at home a few days ago . That was me . And only the three of us know about it . Okay . - Wrap your note around this . - What is this ? A paperweight Big Jim used to give out with every car . My dad hated it almost as much as the lemon Jim sold him . It 'll take your note straight through whatever the hell is down there and it 'll also prove to Barbie that it 's actually from Chester 's Mill . All right , next stop , Barbie . Hopefully . Wait , wait . The signal 's back . Barbie sent you another e-mail . " Julia , hang in there . Whenever you get scared , just remember the first time we kissed . At the dome by Joe 's house at sunset . The stars coming out . I can 't wait to hold you there again . Love , Your Stray . " He 's alive . Quick , let 's write something back . - The signal 's lost . - It doesn 't matter . - He 's alive . - So you 're gonna jump ? No , he doesn 't want me to . - He wants to meet face to face . - How do you know that ? He proved it was him by signing it , " Your Stray . " I called him that once . The thing about the first kiss , wrong place , wrong time , wrong weather . " At the dome by Joe 's house . At sunset . Stars coming out . " It was actually in the middle of town late at night in the pouring rain . Heh . The dude does have some romance in him . - But why be so mysterious ? - Maybe he has to be . Maybe wherever he is someone 's watching him . Guess it 's worth a shot going out to the dome . - I 'm going alone . - But we wanna see him . - And we should be with you . - I know , but we don 't know if it 's safe . It 's just something I need to do by myself . I 'm still not sure we should do this . Sam , I know it 's a risk , but I have to find out if he knows a way back into Chester 's Mill . Okay . But if he has a bad reaction or I don 't get the dosage exactly right ... This is no way for anyone to live . - You can 't ... - Even for him . But don 't get a good lather with it . It 's that dry and it won 't raise the beard . All right , pal . That if the soap 's dry , and you won 't get a lather , then you raise that beard , you 're ... It 's not gonna ... Not gonna be clean . I 'm gonna give you something to help you out . You don 't wanna ... You don 't want ... Want it ... You don 't want it to just ... Ow . It hurt . - Now what ? - Now we wait . Oh ! Dude , this is getting old ! Why didn 't you say you work for my dad ? Yo , baby steps . You 're wound kind of tight . - Does he know you found me earlier ? - No . That 's between us . I swear . - How long have you worked here ? - Ever since they caught me sneaking into their server two years ago , finding out stuff they didn 't want anyone to know . - So they co-opted you . - It was that or get tossed to the feds . So I 'm on the payroll , securing the systems against people like me . Hey , since we 're opening up , how the hell did you get out of that dome ? And you never answered my question . Why is your old man obsessed with that egg ? Shh ! You talk way too much . - You say you 're my friend , right ? - Yeah , man . Yeah , well , now you 're gonna get a chance to prove that . You 're gonna get me to the dome . The place where the National Guard shoots trespassers on sight ? Yeah . And you 're gonna do it , or the military 's gonna find out that you 've been breaking through their firewall . Certain things are more difficult to accomplish than others . Like my dad said , work your magic . So , what , you 're just gonna hole up here till we catch whoever did this ? No , I 'm not lying low for anyone . So who do you think 'll be mad at you ? This could take a while . Well , I 'm not gonna lie to you . Some people in this town aren 't my biggest fans . - Well , there 's Roger Lopez . - Mm-hm . When the windmill went up , he was not happy that I wouldn 't let him run the show . There 's Tom Tilden , pissed because we used his pigs for the flu virus . Eyeballed me pretty hard at Barbie 's memorial . And there 's Phil Bushey . He 's lying in a clinic with a gunshot wound to his chest . More likely it 's Terry Donahue . Or his brother Al . Neither one of them ever really liked me . And there 's , uh ... There 's Larry McCall . Yeah , right before the dome came down , he was really in my face about repo 'ing his car . That can 't be everyone . - Well , it 's a start . - Great . You talk to those people and we 'll talk to these . to get an answer about their loved ones who are currently trapped under this dome . - Military 's been here for at least ... - What are you not telling us ? My sister 's in there . I wanna know ! Hey . Gets crazier by the day , huh ? Identification ? Michael Bryant . Aktaion , Radiation Specialist . That 's me . Thumb scan . Right . Now you 're clear . Thank you . Be safe , sir . Will do . Open the gate ! - All right ! - Move on up . Come on , move it . Excuse me . How far is it to the dome ? Sixteen klicks . But a civilian like you needs an escort to go anyway . Yeah , of course . What unit are you guys with ? Stick to your science . - Set ! - Outside ... - Last one , sir . - Ready . Pauline . Did the Rapture come ? - This is heaven , huh ? - No , Lyle . You 're not dead . You 're alive . God , how 'd you get in Chester 's Mill ? We 're not there . We 're in Zenith . You got out of the dome two days ago . And Sam got here yesterday . - Oh . - Nice seeing you too . Whoa . I dreamed I was falling . Just falling and falling . - It felt like my head cracked . - That 's what you get when you jump off a cliff thinking you 'd bring the Rapture . How did I survive ? - Where am I ? - You 're in a hospital . You haven 't been yourself the last few days . - A hospital . Uh-uh . No . - Okay . - Lyle , Lyle , Lyle . Calm down . Lyle . - Somewhere we can take him ? - Yeah . Yeah , let 's go . - I gotta go . Sorry to be so dramatic . Saw you driving by , wanted to check in . Sorry to hear about Barbie . How you doing ? I 'm dealing . Wanted to give you this . It 's part of our new safety initiative . You 're a sheriff now ? Yeah , I sure am . Busy first day too . Where you headed ? - Joe 's house . - Wasn 't that destroyed ? Yeah , he thinks there might be some food we can salvage . And I had to get out of the house . Hmm . Well , be careful up there in all that mess . Thanks for the kind words . - Come on through . - Come on . Clear . All right , let 's go . Everybody up ! Move ! Okay , I hate this . Yeah , me too . We 're the ones who got the e-mail . - Yeah , and found the signal first . - No , this is different . - How ? - It 's about Barbie . He 's our friend too . I met him before anyone . - Well , it 's about Barbie and Julia . - Oh . Yeah . Either way , who knew Barbie was so mushy ? That e-mail he sent her ? It 's called being romantic . Boys just don 't get it . Oh , right . I 'm talking to two girls who probably loved The Notebook . - What 's The Notebook ? - Oh , my God . Here we go . That e-mail that Barbie sent Julia was in code to get her to come to the outside of the dome by your house . Yeah . So ? So someone must 've been watching his every move . Yeah , exactly . Is he even gonna be able to get back ? He 'll have to travel past the military 's perimeter and then travel who knows how far to the dome wall . A lot of room for error . I just wish there was something we could do . I hate feeling so useless . - Feeling better ? - Mm-hm . Yeah . Yeah , I think ... Thank you . You too . Well , now you 're back , which means I 'm out of here . - No , you can 't leave . - I kept my end of the bargain . I need your help . The three of us need to go to Chester 's Mill . What the hell for ? No , Pauline , it 's terrible there . I have to get my son out . And I think there are answers there for us . Answers to what ? To what 's been going on for the last 25 years . The dome is connected to what happened that night with Melanie . You don 't know if that 's true . She came back from the dead , for God 's sake . And we may be the only hope of getting people out . When you came back , you were mumbling " Melanie , " over and over again . And then you started saying , " it 's in the cards . " Why ? - I don 't know . - Oh , great . Then all of this was for nothing . No , it 's not for nothing . It means something , " it 's in the cards . " Yeah . No , the cards . I had the cards . When I went over the cliff , I had the postcards with me . Tom Tilden . Junior Rennie . Next time you see your dad , you tell him to go to hell for me . - You seem angry . - Hell , yes . Almost every pig I got is dead , thanks to Big Jim and her . We didn 't infect them with the flu . No , but you two wanna kill everyone . Word gets out that me and my pigs are responsible . People hate my guts now . Where were you today , Tom ? - None of your damn business . - No , actually it is . Wanna know where I 've been ? At sunup , I was at Toot Danver 's place , delivering incubators I don 't need anymore . By 10 , I was at the Cullin farm , trading my mother 's heirloom quilts for food to feed my kids . And all these people will confirm you were there ? Why wouldn 't they ? Now I 'm pawning this generator off on Burt Bailey for whatever he 'll give me for it . You know , I used to admire your old man . Now I wouldn 't spit on him if he was on fire . - Wanna go check on his alibis ? - Yeah , we probably better . Though I have a feeling he didn 't do it . Still a lot of hate for Big Jim in everyone we talked to . Yeah . We better check on him . Dad , it 's me . Are you there ? You have any luck ? Not yet , Junior . It 's gonna take a while . Dad , where are you ? Dad , answer me . Where are you ? This was your doing . You cut us off from the rest of the world , turn us against each other . Now you trick me into believing that Barbie 's coming back ? Is that what you 're doing ? - Phil , what are you ... ? - Doing here ? Let 's just say I 'm not supposed to be out of the clinic . And I 'm guessing that this is against doctor 's wishes too . Oh , no . You won 't be needing that anymore . That what this is about ? You not being sheriff anymore ? Because it was Julia and Barbie that fired you , not me . Oh , come on . Everybody knows that nothing happens in Chester 's Mill without the hidden hand of Big Jim Rennie . If that were true , my hand would be hidden in your chest ripping your damn heart out . You got me to do the dirty work for your plan to burn up the people 's food . I was by your side , Jim . And I took a bullet for you . I almost died because I trusted you . Well , I got the same problem , Phil . I put my trust in the wrong people . Luckily today , I found someone I could . Come on , come on . Keys in the back pocket . Come on . Come on . Get it ! Come on . - You okay ? - Yeah . Guess we can work together now . Yes , we can . Give me the keys . Take the lady home , I 'll take care of Phil . - You sure ? - Good job . Come on , Phil . Get up . Get in there . We 're never getting out of here alive . Yeah , we all got problems . These are the events that Pauline foresaw in the order that I got them . This isn 't the order in which they happened . First the dome came down , then the missile strike , then came the red rain . The obelisk . Yeah , but that 's here in Zenith . And this is the last card I got . So these postcards don 't tell us anything we don 't know . There 's nothing that comes next . Wait , wait , wait . The obelisk wasn 't the last postcard that I drew . There was one more , but the dome came down before I could send it . Red door ? Well , why 'd you draw this , Pauline ? I don 't know . But we better find it . I missed you . I missed you . Why ? No , get away from him ! - Take your hands off of him ! - Don 't jump ! Leave him alone ! Barbie ! Don 't jump ! Barbie ! Barbie !

 i - Previously on Caprica ... No , Ben ! A group known as soldiers of the one Is responsible for the bombing . We don 't really know the people closest to us . My daughter died in the bombing of train number 23 , But I think she may have caused it . My daughter was a terrorist ! I 'm just trying to find out who I am . I 'm Zoe And the avatar and the robot . Like some kind of what-you-call-it three-parter . Trinity . That 's what you are . I 've been given a mission that will change my life . I have someone for you to find- - Keon Gatwick . I need to know I can count on you To get me to Gemenon . I made a promise to Zoe before she died . I need to get something to Gemenon . I 'll see what I can do . Everything I 've built is on the line . People are so angry , They are throwing away their Graystone computers . Sarno 's making public opinion , And everyone in the 12 worlds is watching . i - Have Priyah book me on Sarno . Blood for blood . It 's the Tauron way . Daniel Graystone lost his daughter , right ? I lost my daughter and my wife . Balance it out . Hm - what 's going on ? Bomb in a holocafe three hours ago . Place was closed and empty . Okay , so not out to kill . Threat ? Or warning or nuisance Or personal beef with the owner . Or S.T.O. What ? You don 't come back after ten years Just to blow up a train . No , they want us scared . Small bomb , middle of the night . My money 's on copycats . Yeah , well , if you got no S.T.O. Worries , Maybe you don 't want to hear About what I picked up at the courthouse . Don 't be coy . I hate that . What you got ? Intercolonial court on Libran Handed that down an hour ago- - Last matter of the day , Themis Standard Time . A search warrant for a private school ? How 'd you get this ? When Amanda Graystone Held up that little infinity pendant At the memorial service , She handed us grounds To search Zoe 's property , Which includes the contents of her locker at school And any other locker she might have used . So you 're gonna call in the press , make a thing of it ? I might . Keep it tasteful . Good morning . Hi . Good morning . Am I , uh , too sweaty for you ? - Mm - mm . Ah , is that your phone ? Clarice willow . Get off me . Get off me right now . Clarice , what 's going on ? Oh , I 'm so sorry . It 's my fault entirely . Global defense department ! Listen carefully , everybody ! I need you to step away from the lockers right now ! Everyone , now ! Step away ! Clear the hallway . Let 's go . Ladies . That 's it . Move . Move out . Come on , folks . That 's it . Toss everything . That 's it . Toss them all . Keon . Keon , we need to talk . I 'll walk away . You follow in a few . Next one . This is clear . This is a script . It 's a list of talking points . " I loved my daughter very much ... " - We only have a couple hours . - " but I knew she was troubled . " there were disturbing signs Well before I developed the holoband technology . " All it needs are stage directions . Should I point to my heart ? Daniel , please . Look , we 're not telling you how to say it . Use your own phrasing just what to say . Well , I don 't want to say she was troubled . - It 's important . - Why ? If she had a preexisting problem , It takes the onus off the holoband . Well , then I 'll--I 'll find a different way of saying it . She 's , uh , not happy I 'm going on Sarno . Exactly how not happy ? Not happy enough to make another announcement ? - No . - If she contradicts you- - She 'll be fine . You should probably play it a little guilty . You missed the warning signs . You 'll always blame yourself a little bit because of that . People want contrition . Just make it clear it 's not guilt For making a dangerous product . No , it had nothing to do with the holoband . Well , that 's just true . That was great . Do that . I 'm a star . Can you say it all from the beginning again ? Yeah ? Why isn 't it done ? i - Because , so-fis-tace , they 're both in the house , And there 's two other people in there . How big a bloodbath do you want ? Right , no . Gods , uh , no bloodbath . It 's ... You still want to do this , right ? Yes . Of course . Then have patience , Yoseef  . This has all been very very upsetting . And I 'm--I 'm gonna make sure it doesn 't happen again . Now , everybody just go home . I 'll see you tomorrow . Go on . Are they gone ? Yeah , they went ahead to the studio . I need to get dressed . Do you know where the coat to this is ? I have no idea . That 's gonna strobe , anyway . Yeah , you 're right . I just can 't believe you 're going out there To dance on her grave like this . I 'm just saying the exact same thing that you said . I didn 't say she was crazy . She blew up a train . Maybe . You know , I don 't even know what she did . Maybe she was just running away . You think I want to do this ? I don 't want to do this , But I have to , because you opened up this little dialogue With greater Caprica . I didn 't mean to go on television . You are deliberately going on television . Sweetheart , there were cameras all over that park . I was just talking to the crowd . We just have to go with it , all right ? Does this- - does this tie work ? Yeah , it 's great . Okay . Look , can 't you just go out there And say that this is a very sad time for our family And that we need time to process- - - I wish , but - - but that just doesn 't play . The car should be here by now . Serge ! Doesn 't play ? Doesn 't play ? Did you actually hear what you just said ? I don 't have time for this right now , sweetheart . I 'm about to go on international television . We are not company spokespeople . We 're parents ! - Parents ? Actually , no , we 're not . Can I help you , daniel ? No . * * Oh , hell . Oh , hello , beautiful . How are you doing ? Me ? I 'm doing great . Thanks for asking . Well , so , yeah . They leave you down here all alone ? Yeah , yeah . Let 's take a closer look . You know , that is the finest work That I 've ever done , designing that . Mm-hmm . You need a name . I want to- - I want to go through it again . - Yeah , let 's run it . - One more time . - I still see the bruises . - I 'm doing my best . She was complicated . Long before I invented the holoband- - " troubled " is better than " complicated . " " complicated " is meaningless . I shouldn 't have to say it in one word , anyway . It 's ridiculous . Zoe was ... Zoe 's troubles started a long time ago . How 's that ? " Zoe 's troubles " ? No , it 's not the same . " I loved Zoe . " What ? Yeah , uh , it 's a good place for you to start . " I loved Zoe , and I wish I 'd seen the signs , But it wasn 't the holoband . " She was troubled . Give me a cigarette , cyrus . You can 't smoke while I 'm working . Oh ... Rebecca , I am so sorry . I did not mean to offend you . But the idea of going on live television , Quite frankly , makes me want to vomit . Is there anything I can do to help change your mind ? No . I 'll give you 1,000 cubits if you let me have a cigarette . Done . Thank you . Where were you ? You weren 't at school . They called . I was with uncle Sam . It 's not a problem , is it ? I guess not . We won 't tell your father . On Tauron , when you 're 13 , you 're a man . You make your own decisions . Um , okay . Thank you , tsattie . He barely sees you . He shouldn 't be angry when he does . What do you want to be , William ? I don 't know yet . I haven 't really thought about it . Huh . No ... Not when you grow up . What do you want to be now ? Well , there was this job for kids , Where you work inside the locker rooms With the pyramid players . Okay , be that . It 's just that dad knows the owner , Mr. Graystone . - Uh-huh . I 'm not sure if they 're still friends . I 'm not sure if he still likes him . You think you only get things from friends ? You get the best things from enemies ... Because they 're scared of you . Sam can look into it , okay ? Your uncle knows how to make things happen . Yoseef . - Sam . You 're the one who sent me to do this , you know ? You 're gonna have to be able to live with it . Just get it done . Well , keep your pants on . I 'm going in now . Wait a minute . What ? Wait ? Sam . Sam ! G.D.D. What ? Global agents . Okay , my guys , inside . Just give me a second . Everybody in ? Press , you got to stay outside ! - You can 't do this here . - Warrant . My--my husband does defense work on these premises . The girl 's room is downstairs . Everybody wears gloves . Okay , the warrant only applies to the residence . We 're not gonna go anywhere near your husband 's lab , okay ? You 're gonna do this to her , I want to see this . I want to see this ! Doctor , doctor , please . Stay calm for a second . We 're not gonna do anything to her . We 're just trying to find t who turned her into a bomber . These two are already logged . Please , not her cello . She 's--she 's - at least please tell them To be careful with it . Careful with the cello . You really have to do this ? Really ? I mean , what do you think you 're gonna find here ? I really don 't know ... Maybe who she met with ... Who brainwashed her into believing In a moral dictator called god ... Maybe the name of some other kid Who blew up a Caprican business in the middle of the night . I really don 't know . Do you honestly think that information 's here ? Really ? Jordan ... In the jewelry box . - That wasn 't - - I put that there . That wasn 't here . There are loose ends , doctor , And I 'm sorry if we have to take your daughter 's life apart In order to put other terrorists behind bars , But if we have to , then so be it . What is this to you ? Did you lose someone on that train ? I lost everyone on that train . And , um , I 'll see you later . Keon ... What are you doing here ? Last time I saw you , I had you pinned to the ground . You said you 'd help me get to Gemenon . Well , I was wrong . I can 't . You shouldn 't have scampered off during the locker search . It made you look guilty . You should go . I 'm the only one here today , And I have to have this bucket case Fixed by the end of the afternoon , so ... What are you doing ? My mom does repairs , like , for a living . Well , what if someone sees us together ? Who 's seeing ? Nothing in Zoe Graystone 's room . No , the parents cleaned out the room . Look at the school . Yeah , nothing there either- - Minor drug stuff . You guaranteed me detonators and infinity symbols . Sir , it is too clean . Look , somebody got to those kids . Please , give me the power To access communications to the students- - E-sheets , phones . Gee , scout leader Duram , This slope 's getting kind of slippery . Ben Stark and Zoe Graystone- - I guarantee you they are not the only students The S.T.O. turned at that school . Now , we find out who it was who warned those kids , We find out who it was who 's running the operation . You 're wrong about this , I own your khayss . Tauron slang , That 's very street of you , sir . Fine . I 'm wrong , I 'll serve them to you on a plate . There . Well , that 's a nice-looking chest . I think it looks great . So let 's , uh- - Let 's check you out , shall we ? See that we didn 't glitch any connections . Running diagnostic test . * * Look at you . Huh ? I 'm gonna make you dance . All right ? Okay , here , here . Try this . Try this . Diagnostic test complete . Last of the e-sheets for today . Now , if we had an up-to-date computer ... All right , check around 6 : 00 a.m. It 's most likely a group-send to the entire student body . I 've never seen you like this . Yeah ? Well , we had Ben Stark , and we let him go . Look , I 'm sorry . I 'm not putting this all on you . We all got complacent . We 're all responsible . Really ? So are we all responsible For the bad wheat crop on Aerilon ? Well , why are you doing it ? You 're still here . You 're working as hard as I am . Looks to me like Gemenese scum Are luring good Caprican kids into a killer cult . Anyone doing that needs to be destroyed . Yeah . Oh , I got something for Willie . They 're like jacks , Since you threw out his fancy games . What are these , bones ? Well , Tauron children play jacks With the finger bones of the Tauron children Who lose at jacks . that was a joke . They 're bones from chicken feet . Male announcer : The interview you thought you 'd never see . Daniel Graystone coming up at 10 : 00 on Backtalk with Baxter Sarno . Oh , that 's the man you don 't like . Yeah . well ? It 's gonna be taken care of . Good . No , the dead don 't really die Until their death is avenged . My daughter and your daughter Are caught between life and death . He 's gonna pay . Good . Believe me . * * Hey , guys . Okay ! Welcome to Backtalk . Uh , thank you guys so much for coming out . We have got a pretty amazing show . I don 't need to tell you why , So let 's , uh- - Let 's get through this horrible monologue That I wrote two minutes ago . Uh , not that things are perfect here on Caprica . Um , some of you know that , uh , many residents Not too happy with the government right now . They 're saying 30 seconds . Let 's go . They 're saying they are soft on terrorism . - Okay . - So in order to protest- - I see you guys laughing over there . Okay , here we go . - Daniel , they 're , uh - - they 're about to introduce you . Okay ! I just--I need a second ! Oh , my gosh , they broke our back . They sent us peppermint sticks . There 's nothing we can do . And finally , some of you may have heard , Uh , yesterday security was called in here , Uh , but there 's nothing to worry about now . It turns out it was a huge misunderstanding . I was only bombing figuratively . figuratively . Wow ! Yes . Fire half of the writing staff . Okay , on that grim note , Let 's bring out our first guest . Uh , needs no introduction . Ladies and gentlemen , please welcome daniel Graystone . * * Ah , there he is . There he is . Cyrus , the global defense just came to the house . They ransacked the place . They 're doing this wrong . Daniel--there are things he has to say . Can we just talk about this later ? - It 's too late . He 's on . - So , Mr. Graystone , Thank you for coming on . Um , I think I-I may have mentioned you A couple of times this week . I don 't know if you- - - yes , you did . Yeah ? My solstice wish was for free publicity . Probably should have been a little more specific . I feel so much better About my monologue right now . All right , that 's - I 'm sorry , listen , Um , this is - this is what 's going on . - Is this water ? - Um , that , indeed , is water . Were you expecting - was there something else In your rider that you needed ? - No , I 'm fine with water . Can we get something stronger for , uh , Mr. Graystone ? We 're good ? - I 'm fine . Thank you . - Okay . Um ... Your wife , um , has stated that your daughter , Uh , Zoe Graystone , Was involved with terrorists and may have been- - May have been responsible for the bombing ... We don 't know anything for sure , but , yes , It does seem that she 'd fallen in With this group , the Soldiers of the One . She was ... She was , uh ... She was troubled , uh ... - Okay , let me just- - But this started a long time before I invented the holoband . - Let me tell you what I see . - Troubled ? Let me just tell you what I see here . Uh , I see a lot of young people Growing up in a virtual world right now . Yes , I 've--I 've actually heard your theory about this . I 've heard it before , and if I may . Let 's not tall theories , then . Let 's talk facts . - All right . - Facts--your daughter- - Your troubled daughter , Uh , growing up with , uh , holobands And learning that there are no consequences , Absolutely . But ... He was right . It 's not a good word . It 's not a good word . You know it 's not a good word . But--but you see , the thing is , She didn 't even like the holoband . - She didn 't like the holoband ? - Not at all . - Hated it ? - Yes . Maybe because it was making her want to blow things up ? you know , and--and the whole- - No . Amanda ! Oh , wait . No , no , no , no . Um , ladies and gentlemen , uh , please welcome , Uh , Dr. Amanda Graystone . Dr. Amanda Graystone , wow . Let 's get her a chair , please . Um , people watching at home , Uh , let 's , uh , hit " record , " And we 'll be right back after these messages . This is going to be very exciting , So stick around . Okay , we are back . Uh , Dr. Graystone , this is a shock and a surprise . Yes . It 's a surprise for me too , But , um , I cou - I couldn 't stand there . I just had to . I-I- - You 're both getting this wrong . I 'm getting this wrong . Okay . I just flashed back to my first and third marriages there . I mean , um ... Okay , I 'm sorry . I don 't know why - I don 't know why I made a joke . Um , Dr. Graystone , uh , what is your take on this ? You 're out here saying that Zoe was crazy . Zoe wasn 't crazy . She wasn 't . Zoe was--Zoe was angry . She was defiant . She was rude . She was frustrating . Okay . Well , show me a 15-year-old girl who isn 't . She slammed her door . She played loud music . She said that we embarrassed her in public . Slammed her door and played loud music And blew up a commuter train . Well , when was I supposed to call the cops ? Well , I don 't know . Maybe when she started worshipping The big destruct-o god in the sky maybe . We didn 't know . There weren 't any signs . You said she was troubled . - - she- - She was angry . It 's a better word . My wife 's right . Okay , angry , but I 'd also like to add Morally blank , Because the virtual world Is a poor teacher and doesn 't teach you boundaries . You know who would completely agree with that is Zoe , And that 's exactly how the S.T.O. got to her . The--okay , I 'm sorry , you have to slow down And back up and keep in mind half of this audience is stoned . Okay . Okay . She--she saw things in the virtual world- - Ritual sacrifices , Games like New Cap city , And--and she felt the absence of moral guidelines , Just like you do , like--like a lot of folks do . And--and into that absence steps the S.T.O. , Offering this--this marvelous ultimate moral arbiter . It 's quite appealing , For a teenage girl , especially . You 're--you 're assuming all of this . No . No , I talked to her . You did ? When ? Uh ... After she died , I ... I created a virtual version of her , an avatar . You cre--I 'm sorry . You- - You made an electronic ghost of your dead daughter . I just wanted to hear the sound of her voice again . I sympathize . I sympathize . This--this is very disturbing . Yes . Yes , it is disturbing , But--but show me a parent who would not do anything possible To--to try and understand their child . - Okay , well ... - It was disturbing . I know that . Hey . But I was trying to make sense ... You got a bracelet ? There 's a plastic bracelet for backstage visitors . I used the tools , the gifts that I have to do that , And I know she wasn 't real , but ... i - Oo-day-my oo-den-os plastic bracelet , But I could use that I.D. Badge . I used the tools , the gifts that I have to do that ... - Hay-doo tay say ay-soh-doy . But it did offer some small insight Into her motivations . If--if this whole thing was a reaction to the v-world , Then we 're just right back At square one , though , aren 't we ? Isn 't technology the problem ? I mean , isn 't - - isn 't the v-world the problem ? - No , that 's not the problem . - Maybe . - I 'm sorry . Maybe ? - Maybe . Okay , I 'm starting to like you , Mr. Graystone . We thought we could control the content in v-world , Especially for kids , but we 've failed , clearly . I think the temptation to hack the code is too great . All right , well , then what is your solution ? - I don 't know . - Well , t-think out loud . I don 't know . I ... For there to be any- - Any beneficial change , you 'd have to- - To take away the profit motive , Like when they legalized drugs , for instance . Okay , well , that 's a good point , But you 're also talking about something That took decades of--of pretty violent arguing back and forth- - Well , you know , why not ? Why couldn 't we- - Why couldn 't we try it ? But this is a huge leap you 're talking about . No , Graystone Industries will no longer charge For licensing of any legal spaces , And--and any profit we make off the bands Will go to some charity or- - A foundation that we can create . we 'll create something For young people to find the right experiences And the right values . - Okay , this is - - you 're saying this now , And--and I support it . I think this is very admirable . Are you gonna say this Monday To your stockholders and your board of directors ? Great P.R. No , that 's great P.R. - Yes , I can promise this . - That 's 60 % of our net . My company will make no more profit On the holobands or v-world licensing . Hold me to it , Caprica . Okay , well , uh , speaking for Caprica , And you know that I like to , Uh , we will . Wow . Uh , thank you , doctors Graystone , This was a fascinating , uh , discussion That I was completely unprepared for . Uh , thank you very much , And I think we need to credit Amanda With the most amazing save Since Bracken Oka ... she 's on there ? Beat Jenkins at the horn ? She 's not supposed to be . Let 's pick an analogy where the Bucs won , okay ? - Okay , I don 't let my - - I could kill her with my own hands ... Sleep well every night . Couldn 't you ? I see a lot of panicked faces behind me . This might take a while . Don 't say that . You should probably go on home . All right , well , I got a taxi , so ... I can get you a car . I can get another one . I 'll see you at home . - Okay . - Love you . - Thanks again . - Yeah . Excuse me . Uh , sorry . I 'm , uh , Baxter 's driver . If you like , I could take you home . Yeah , perfect . Thank you . What 's your name ? I 'm Sam . Nice to meet you . I 'm Amanda . Nice to meet you . you saved my life with this one . So , um , did you have something in your locker ? Did you get a warning ? I can 't tell you . I can 't . I just can 't . I get why you 're being cautious . That 's smart . But I have to do this . I have to go to Gemenon and take Zoe 's package with me . I have to . If there 's any way you can help me ... Uh ... I can maybe set up a meeting with Barnabas . That 's all I can do . He 's the one who can decide If you get the S.T.O. ' s help . Yes . Thank you . Are those homemade ? I 'm sorry , what ? - Your tattoos - - are they homemade ? I 'm sorry . I don 't mean to pry , but I 'm a plastic surgeon . I 'm really interested in that sort of thing . They 're cultural ... Tauron . Oh , yes , of course . They have meanings , right ? Yeah . A lot of people here on Caprica Think they mean that you 're a gangster , But they don 't . Of course not . Well , I mean , it might , but ... It doesn 't have to . You know , you get ink because you 're a parent , Or you got a fancy pedigree , Or there 's some sort of ritual , maybe made a mistake . I could give you a fancy pedigree . I could ... Add a few accomplishments , take away a few mistakes . Yeah , well , that wouldn 't be real , I 'm afraid . Very little is real these days . This isn 't the way home . Come on , Sam . " don 't . " Larry , hi . Um , listen , I-I need to get a hold of Sam . And it 's an emergency , and it 's- - He won 't answer his phone . Please . Have him call me soon as you hear from him , okay ? Thanks . Turn on your frakkin ' phone ! * she does me cold * Excuse me , this isn 't the way home . Yeah , there was an accident on the thruway . I 'm just gonna cut through little Tauron . Don 't worry . It 's good people here ... Not very nosy ... Which is a good thing , right ? What with all those people angry about all those deaths . I lost my sister-in-law and my niece on that train . My gods , I 'm so sorry . Yeah . Well , you can 't turn back time . Nothing I could do to change that now . Yeah . I guess all we can try and do is understand . Or look for some kind of balance . Maybe try to even things out . My sister-in-law 's name was Shannon . My niece was named Tamara . She was gonna make us all proud . Sam . Hey . Larry hates it when I come home bloody . Did you do it ? I ... Can 't hear you over the water . Is it done ? Yeah , it 's done . Why you think I 'm washing up , huh ? She was getting a little , uh ... A-po-play-ktay in the car . Didn 't want a fight in a closed space , So I ordered her out of the car , Said we were having engine trouble , She should go inside this restaurant . Connie 's place , remember ? We used to go there in high school . - I know Connie 's place . - Yeah . I sent her inside , right ? Jacks . Nice . And , uh , she notices right away that there 's no one inside , Could have called ahead just in case . So I 'm standing in the front With the knives , tsfa-gi-dess . - Yeah . - Frak . She tries to get out back to the alley , but it 's locked . You killed her in the kitchen ? Well , that stuff they spray at crime scenes Can 't tell the difference between animal blood And human blood . You really did it . No , I 'm messin ' with you to teach you a lesson About yanking me around like this . Wait . What ? - Hmm ? - Are you- - Was that sarcastic ? What do you think ? I can 't tell , Sam ! Stop frakkin ' around ! Did you kill her ? I don 't turn off my phone , Yoseef , And I got other people who call me , you know ? So , yeah ... I got your , like , 60 text messages . I didn 't kill her . Scared her a bit . Bet she 's getting a lot of that right now . You 're frakkin ' with me . Oh , yeah , I 'm frakkin ' with you , 'cause I knew you couldn 't go through with it . Frakkin ' Caprican in a Tauron body . Nah . Hmm ? No , I talked to her . You did ? When ? Again ? Weren 't you , uh , watching this earlier ? After she died , I ... I created a virtual version of her , An avatar . Yeah , well , I like it . Seems like every time this family 's on tv , I get so much out of it . I just wanted to hear the sound of her voice again . Feeling better ? Yeah , I 'm fine . I guess people are just ... Really scared and angry right now . I don 't blame them . I think from now on , We--we both need to be a little more careful . So you made an avatar of Zoe . It was nothing . You know how it works . It 's just a picture of her , nothing more . Yeah . I know how an avatar works , And so do you . Why did you do it ? Why didn 't you tell me ? I didn 't know it got that bad . I mean ... You could have talked to me . I know . I just ... I miss her ... You know ? Yeah , I know . I just miss her . I miss her too . I really ... I really do . Want to watch tv ? Graystones are on Sarno tonight . I heard they were really good . I am so sick of them . They 're everywhere . - Oh , awful . - Rich . - Disgusting . - Ridiculous people . Hmm ... Sync by kuniva

 Previously on Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D ... Tell us about Cybertek and the Deathlok Program . - Mike Peterson 's alive . - They did something to him . SIMMONS ; GH-325 . Agent Coulson was injected with it and literally minutes later , his wounds showed signs of cellular regeneration . Fury went to dangerous lengths to keep this under wraps . We can 't share this with anyone . For their safety and ours . Encrypted line secure . Agent Melinda May . Update log 93 . Coulson knows . - Agent John Garrett , confirm . Agent Antoine Triplett , confirmed . Well , it 's no Four Seasons . As far as safe houses go , it 's not bad . Phuket didn 't even have mattresses . Yeah , but Cairo had 1,000-thread-count sheets . With that sateen finish . Hey , be careful what you get used to . Dig out that sat phone , get Coulson on the line . I wanna run down through the list of potential candidates with him . You really think The Clairvoyant was on the Index ? Rejected off the Index . Possibly . Just hope it 's not the Amazing Kreskin . - I used to love that guy . - Who ? Area three breach . Ahh ! Hit him With the ICER ! You realize , Agent Coulson , they have these things called teleconferences now . Nice to see you , too , Agent Hand . Thank you all for coming on such short notice . Little unconventional meeting this way , isn 't it ? From the reports I 've read , " Unconventional " seems to be Coulson 's middle name these days . Fight breaks out , let me take Blake . He 's coy , but scrappy . I 'll explain everything as soon as we hit 50,000 feet . This way . Cruising altitude reached , bearing 90 degrees just over the North Pole . - Thank you . - Apologies for the song and dance . We brought you here as a precaution . A precaution against what ? The Clairvoyant . If there is someone out there who can read minds , at least up here we 're as far away from him as possible . Think that maybe the northern lights will knock a few bars off his psychic Wi-Fi . Coulson , you know S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s stance on psychics . They don 't exist . Are you suddenly a believer ? Not definitively . But I had a recent experience with an Asgardian who could bend people 's will with her voice . Forced me to open my mind , so to speak . All we know for sure is The Clairvoyant 's been a step ahead of us , stealing plays from our playbook . And it 's pissing me off . I take it you 've all read Agent Garrett 's latest report ? The hit on the safe house . Mr. Peterson 's alive and kicking . - We call him Deathlok . - That was the project 's codename . Agent Garrett and I have been tracking him the last few weeks . And we think The Clairvoyant 's super-soldier bodyguard came after us for a reason . We 're getting close . To what ? His identity ? We 've narrowed the list to 13 candidates . Narrowed it how ? From what ? Agent Garrett has been taking a second look at S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s gifted Index . Specifically the rejects . Individuals S.H.I.E.L.D. interviewed who are believed to have psychic abilities , but were ultimately dismissed . So you think we 've encountered The Clairvoyant before ? Think how many cases we 've encountered across the globe , how many cases we 've vetted , it 's more than possible , it 's probable . I need more coffee . Let 's assume what you 're saying is possible , what then ? If we 're going up against a natural clairvoyant , how do you suggest we combat that ? By compartmentalizing the information . A member of my team is an expert at pattern recognition and analysis . Finding needles in haystacks . She 'll prioritize the candidates on Garrett 's list , locate them , then pair us off into random teams . That way only one person knows the full scope of the mission . You do understand that this person you 're referring to , she 'd need to be a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent to be granted that level of access . I 'm glad you brought that up . Guys , I swear , I am fine . How much blood are you going to draw before you believe me ? Your recovery , it 's honestly quite unbelievable . Strange . We know Coulson had a very different recovery experience . So we understand why he 's hesitant about us sharing our findings with others . Yeah , but something like this drug , it needs to be studied . It has the potential to save so many lives . We 'd like to send a blood sample of yours to some colleagues to do a molecular breakdown . Maybe if you spoke to Agent Coulson ... I don 't think that 's a good idea . If Coulson thinks it 's important that this stay between us , then we should trust him , right ? He 's the boss . So you 're saying we should obey the rules ? Who are you and what have you done with Skye ? Skye . Upstairs . Top brass wants to see you . Pairing off makes total sense . Just one thought though . What if we make it a double-blind ? How so ? Well , I 'll give one person from each team the potential Clairvoyant 's coordinates , and I 'll give the other one the identity . That way no one person knows the full specs of the op until you get there . I like how you think . I like how she thinks . One question . How am I supposed to access all the classified files without someone in the room ? I don 't have clearance . Now you do . Welcome to S.H.I.E.L.D. , Skye . I told them to come up . I ... I don 't know what to say . - Thank you . - Don 't thank me . You 've passed every required S.H.I.E.L.D. exam with flying colors . For a Level 1 agent . You 've assisted us on multiple field missions , put your life on the line . You earned this . Hell , you took two in the gut . More than Sitwell here 's ever done . Okay , everyone , back to work . Congratulations . - Congratulations , Skye ! - Thank you ! Congratulations . Couldn 't have done it without a great and very patient S.O. Yeah , you could 've . I 'm no clairvoyant , but I do believe some things are meant to be . Can 't say I 'm a fan of this double-blind situation . How will the field teams meet us at the destinations ? They won 't . They 'll be on standby . We can 't risk The Clairvoyant knowing we 're coming . What you 're saying is one of these teams could be heading straight into an ambush , without backup . Agent Sitwell , we 've just received word from the Triskelion . You have orders to report to the Lemurian Star immediately . So I assume you 'll take his place ? In your hunt for Santa Claus ? No . I 'm taking a transport jet back to the Hub where I can quarterback the field teams via satellite . Someone 's gonna have to pull your asses out of the fire when things go south . I 'll be in touch . I guess I got a boat to catch . - Good luck , Agent Coulson . - You , too , Agent Sitwell . Okay . On this phone , you will find a set of coordinates that 'll lead you to one of the three potential Clairvoyants I 've chosen . When you 're within a mile , your partner will be granted access to the candidate 's name and profile on their own phone . Makes sense ? You know , we haven 't officially met . John Garrett . I guess lying unconscious on a gurney really should not count . How 're you feeling ? A lot better , actually . I 've been shot a couple times myself . Back , shoulder . Had my throat cut once . But you know the toughest one ? Thing about a third-degree burn , the burn itself doesn 't hurt at all . Crazy , right ? The nerve endings get all fried . But the area around the burn ? That smarts . Still , gut shot 's the worst . Sir , I know what you did for me . How you risked your life to save me . So , thank you . You got a good team around you . I just jumped on the bandwagon . Well , you trained one of them , sir . Guess it all comes full circle . Ward 's your S.O. I was his . Turn , turn , turn . But this S.O. thing goes both ways . You 've had a big impact on him . He 's different than I remember him . Different how ? Well , the tough thing about being a specialist is being alone . A team gives you a whole new perspective . Guess it 's the difference between fighting against something and fighting for something . Or someone . Ward 's got that now . Thanks for this . And , Skye , lose the " sir . " I 'm a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent , just like you . What 's this ? Say you need to tag a fleeing vehicle , or a wild monkey , if it was to get away from you . These rounds are built with a micro-receiver , which enables you to track your target via satellite . I 've condensed all the blood sample results into an encrypted file . - Now , if we just had access ... - Jemma , we have a visitor . Oh ! May . Hello . I assume you 're talking about Skye 's blood . There 's just so much we don 't know . - The GH-325 . - 325 . I mean , we don 't know what drug it is , where it came from . Yeah , not to mention any potential side effects , short or long-term . We 're just worried about Skye , and Agent Coulson , of course . Have either of them exhibited any side effects or strange behavior ? - " Strange " is such a subjective term . - No more than usual . Because if they have , or if they do in the future , feel free to contact me first . I can help . Okay ? Okay . You 're all set . Hope you paired me with someone good . Or interesting , at least . Stop worrying - You wear your heart on your sleeve , and your face . I trust your judgment . The way you see the world , it 's different than the rest of us . That 's why I want you to dig deeper into these . The candidates ' psych evaluations ? The Clairvoyant thinks he can read our minds . See if you can read his . We need some insight into who this person really is . A weakness . So , do what you do . Find the exploit . And stop worrying . So Garrett says your family 's like the cable version of the Kennedys . Huh ! I doubt he said that . Fine . I did my own research . Had to , following in golden boy 's footsteps . - There a point to this ? - Just trying to keep things light . - ' Cause that 's what we all need ? - You know , maybe it is . You wanna keep it light ? - The Clairvoyant almost killed Skye . - Yeah ? Well , he did kill my partner . Dan Monroe . Great guy , had a son . You know what it 's like telling a 6-year-old that his dad isn 't coming home ? So we find The Clairvoyant , you might want to stay out of my way . We all got axes to grind . We 're here to take him in . Not out . Ask yourself something , Agent Ward . If Skye hadn 't made it , what would you be thinking right now ? Elijah Fordham , 32 , military background . Here . Serving 18 life sentences for a killing spree in the ' 90s . Sounds more psycho than psychic . Are you a Scorpio ? It 's just , wondering why our newest agent paired the two of us together . Must have thought we were compatible in some way . It was random , Blake . You seem like a Scorpio . You don 't believe in The Clairvoyant , but you believe in astrology . I have some theories of my own . Please tell me we 're here for one of the doctors . So I dropped down through the skylight , used up my whole mag , and hit the final guy right in the chest with a flare gun . Boy , you should 've seen the look on his face when that thing went off . What ? I already told you that one ? - I was there . - For which part ? - The whole thing . - Really ? Damn , I must be getting old . Either that , or I drank a lot more in my 30s than I remember . Or both . You didn 't go through the skylight . I know , but it makes for a better story . File came in . Noriko Sato , 19 , junior at Ball State . The co-ed , I remember . She 's got an IQ over 200 . Ran circles around every agent we sent in to interrogate her . Gave no indication she was gifted . - Family 's got ties to the Yakuza , though . - Heads up . Detour . Imagine that . " Thomas Nash . Injured in a head-on collision . " He 's been catatonic for the past four years . Great . We 're here for a vegetable . I 'll find the director 's office , you get a room number on Nash . Yes , ma 'am . Nobody home . Odd . Oh ! Convenient timing . Think this will make a good story some day ? Ah ! One behind us . You better hope so . Mr. Peterson . Stop . You have a son . Ace . He needs you . We can still help you , Mike . Mike Peterson 's dead . May to Hub . Deathlok 's here . Blake 's down . All backup teams , move in . We have an agent down . Repeat , Agent Blake is down . Lucky the med team got to him when they did . I wouldn 't call anyone in critical condition " lucky . " Deathlok 's more dangerous than we thought . Blake fired six shots , didn 't seem to faze him . Any word on Thomas Nash ? No . He 's a ghost . The facility has him listed as a resident , but it 's all a cover-up . Nash is probably off fishing in Bora Bora right now , laughing at us . And yet Mr. Peterson was waiting for you and Blake at the facility . Why ? Probably same reason he came after Garrett . We 're getting too close . He 's trying to take us out . This shouldn 't have happened . Backup should 've been there alongside Agents Blake and May . The Clairvoyant would 've seen us coming . It appears he did anyway . The plan was flawed from the start . Come on , Vic , the plan was solid . We have an agent down because we weren 't prepared ... Blake knew the risks . Then don 't call me Vic . It 's condescending . Any one of us could 've been ambushed . The point is , Blake 's alive . And we have a suspect . Thomas Nash . I 'm headed inside to prep the field teams . Agent Coulson , when can I expect Agent Simmons for debrief ? - She 's getting ready as we speak . - Good . If I 'm gonna put any more agents in danger , I want them to know exactly what Deathlok is , and what he 's capable of . Honestly , I don 't know how much more you can tell them . Who knows what else they 've done to the man ? Or how much man is left at all . Regardless , S.H.I.E.L.D. sees us as the resident experts on the Deathlok Program . If they want me to stay here at the Hub , then that 's that . Well , don 't you seem awfully chipper to pick up and leave me by my lonesome . - Do I ? - Yes . And I wonder , could it be because the Hub 's lab facilities are much more comprehensive than ours ? In case I 'd like to run a molecular breakdown of Skye 's blood ? Yes , brilliant deduction , Dr. Watson . I 've always pictured you as Watson . Either way , if you 're gonna do this , you 're gonna need my help , at some point , one way or another , eventually . I wouldn 't go that far . I 'll jerry up an encrypted hardline so we can stay in touch . Don 't want the rest of the bosses overhearing what we 're saying . You ready to go ? Agent Triplett . Are you staying at the Hub as well ? Yeah . Garrett 's keeping me here . Help brief the teams on our most recent run-in with the cyber-soldier . - Don 't mind the company , do you ? - No . Not at all . According to Index archives , Nash has been on S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s radar for about six years . Originally a bond trader in Canada , doing very well for himself . Then the Canadian government recruited him to a secret Department H-type program . They were looking for people with psychic abilities . Specifically , people who could control human behavior . - Nash claimed he had a gift . - Claimed ? According to records , he couldn 't affect a person 's behavior , but he could , on occasion , predict it . But S.H.I.E.L.D. crossed him off the Index after his accident because of his supposed catatonic state . Which he recovered from quite nicely . It was all a lie . Just to throw S.H.I.E.L.D. off his scent . You said Blake fired how many rounds ? I heard six . Why ? Because there are only five missing from this magazine . And one from here . These are Fitz 's tag rounds . We can track him . Skye , check all the sat feeds . Find that signal . - On it . - I 'll get us in the air . Nicely done , Blake . I want this perimeter sealed . Two men teams on every exit . - Yes , sir . - Fitz , you got a signal ? 94 % , sir . Deathlok must be inside somewhere . - Possible civilians inside ? - Highly doubtful . This racetrack 's been shut down for months . Move out ! Skye , run a back end from the tactical van . You , I want you 6 feet from Skye at all times , weapons hot . - Ward , it 's okay . I 'm ready . - Ward 's right . I feel bad enough you 're already back in the field . We 're not taking any chances with your safety . This isn 't a surprise party , people . So you can toss stealth out the window . Our target 's wearing body armor and has enhanced cybernetics . Make your shots count . Let 's move . Ringing the bell or knocking ? Knocking , of course . Clear . Fitz , you 're up . It 's time to hunt , boys . Let 's find us a Deathlok . Impressive toy . I prefer the term high-tech hardware . Skye , you online ? Hang on . Northwest corridor is getting something . I 'm pulling up a live feed . I can 't confirm it 's him . Initiating multi-spectrum overlay . What the hell did they do 110 him ? What are you seeing ? It 's not just his leg or his eye . They did stuff to him . It 's all under his skin . Uh , signal 's dead . Retriever 's down . - He knows we 're here . - Fitz , get back to the van . Now ! Contact ! Incoming ! Ward , are you okay ? Uh , I got two men down ! - We need a med team ! - Requesting one now . May , he 's coming your way . Got him ! He just ducked into the southwest stairwell . In pursuit . All teams , he 's headed into the sub-basement . I do not have a visual . Fitz , you have a Retriever down here ? On their way . Easy . I come in peace . How about a signal next time ? Fitz , you getting this ? Uh , barely , sir . It leads down into the sewer system . That 's under at least 40 feet of concrete . We 'll be blind down there . Where 's that little guy going ? Sir , there 's someone else down there . Copy that . What the hell ? NASH " . Agent Coulson . Agent Garrett . I surrender . Forgive me if we don 't shake hands . I don 't like to be touched . Sir , we 've got a lot of wires back here . Don 't touch anything . We need this room swept for explosives . There are no traps here , Agent Coulson . You 're here because we are destined to meet . You 're The Clairvoyant ? I 'm Thomas Nash . Mr. Po gave me that other name . A bit dramatic for my taste . Eyes open , everybody . We don 't know where Deathlok is , or who else is down here . Mr. Peterson is gone . I cut his feed so you won 't find him . But you had him lead us here . Why ? So I could see you with my own eyes instead of his . Now I understand why I couldn 't see you after you died . Because you yourself could not see . You were simply a broken man , who did not know he was broken . You 're one to talk . Let 's pack this freak off to the Fridge where he belongs . Agent Garrett . Look at me . Do you believe you can confine me any more than this chair ? Can somebody please tell me how we turn that stupid voice thing off ? I will join Raina in your prison , Agent Coulson . But I will see you wherever you go . Just as I saw you holding Skye in your arms . Bleeding . Dying - . Knowing it was all your fault . You 're going away . We 're gonna stick you in a little box where no one will ever hear you again . I see you 're angry . Head clouded with lies . You 've been betrayed . And now you fear what 's about to happen . Nothing 's about to happen . Just more empty threats from you . No . It is the inevitable . A force beyond your comprehension is coming for you . You and Skye . She has something we want , and she will die giving it to us . I have seen it . Go to hell . No matter where I go , or what you do to me , I will always ... % GUNSHOT ) What did you do ? Wait , what just happened ? Did Ward just ... Oh , my Lord . I can 't believe it . Bet The Clairvoyant didn 't see that coming . He 's dead . It 's over . He 's a specialist . Cold blood 's a basic requirement . I know . Still I didn 't think Ward would just do something like that . The whole reason I sent him to you was to knock off the rough edges . Maybe you did your job too well . He let his emotions get the best of him . You want me to escort him to the Hub for debrief ? No . I wanna talk to him before he goes in front of the review board . Understood . I got my orders , then . Gotta stay on the hunt for Deathlok . Copy that . Keep me in the loop ? Will do . Take care . And , Phil , go easy on the kid . Just got a message from H.Q. Director Fury 's back . He 's waiting for you at the Triskelion . About damn time . You can talk to him about what 's been bothering you . A lot 's bothering me . Thought you were Coulson . Thanks . Why 'd you do it ? I lost it . I got angry . He pushed all the right buttons . Coulson said the mission was to capture , not to kill . Think about what The Clairvoyant said . What he 's done . Think about the Centipede program . How he experimented on innocent people , like Mike Peterson . How he kidnapped and tortured Coulson . How he ordered Quinn to shoot you . And he wasn 't gonna stop , Skye , not until you were ... I wasn 't gonna let that happen . So what happens now ? I face a S.H.I.E.L.D. review board . Whatever the punishment , I 'll take it . I deserve it . But I don 't regret what I 've done . - You don 't ? - No . Not if it means you 're safe . You and the rest of the team . Yes ! - Fitz ? - Don 't use my name , Jemma ! Why not ? I thought you said ... Use ... Encrypted line ? You 're cutting in and out . Hold on . What happened ... Ward ? Yeah , you said , " Ward . " Took us all by surprise . Keep talking . Okay ? I 'm gonna see if I can clear it up . No idea ... There 's been a great deal of commotion on this end . Hang on , now . I think I found the problem . Looks like someone else is tapping the hardline . Wait , Fitz , I think something 's happening . There 's agents rushing to the Situation Room . What ? Jemma ? Jemma , can you hear me ? Oh , bloody hell . Mind if I talk some stuff through with you ? Are you busy ? I 'm worried . About Ward ? I know . I can 't believe he 'd just kill someone like that . I 'm worried he killed the wrong man . How do we know it was him ? He never spoke . The computer spoke for him . How do we know he was the one controlling it ? Are you saying Nash could have been pretending to be The Clairvoyant ? I 'm saying Nash could 've been a prop . And now he 's dead . After the attacks led us right to him . The investigation all wrapped up in a neat little bow . I feel like he could still be out there , right now , in our heads . Or in our files . When you told me to check into the psych evals , you said something , you said , " Read his mind . " And it got me thinking . And Ward said that The Clairvoyant knew how to push all the right buttons . Raina did that to me , too . Did she mention your father 's death ? Your psych evaluation called it a " defining moment . " These aren 't just personality tests . They 're surveillance on every agent . Pictures . Stats . Where you 've been stationed , who you visit , where you 'd like to eat . " Dinners at The Richmond . " He 's been monitoring us . Think about it . The Clairvoyant only knew you 'd be at Quinn 's villa ... After I dropped the tracker . And the only thing he 's had trouble seeing is what happened to you after you died . Because Director Fury wouldn 't release that file to anyone . No . The Clairvoyant doesn 't have abilities . He has security clearance . He 's an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. - Sir . First off , I wanna say ... - Save it . I don 't want your apologies , I don 't want your excuses . - I 'm not making excuses . - The only thing I wanna know is whether you made the call yourself , or did someone order you to do it ? What ? Don 't play dumb , Agent Ward . Just answer the question . Did someone order you to kill The Clairvoyant ? May ? Another encrypted line . What are you up to , Agent May ? What are you doing here ? Um ... I was just wondering , since we 're ... 'Cause we 're going to the Triskelion , I thought you would like to ... There 's gonna be an aviation team on the ground . They could probably recalibrate it . But I think it should be all right . - Fitz ! - What ? - I was just looking for you . - Why ? I didn 't do anything ! - What ? - What ? I didn 't say you did . What did you do ? Well , I 'm not quite sure , actually . Because , I was down doing maintenance in the avionics bay before ... Okay , why would May , why would May have an unauthorized encrypted hardline in the cockpit , complete with a thumb scanner ? That isn 't in any of the plane 's specs . - Slow down , an encrypted hardline ? - Yeah . Dedicated to one receiver . She 's not supposed to have that . Who is she talking to ? - Cut the line . - What ? You need to cut the line , right now , Fitz . Do not let her call out ! Agent Melinda May . Update log 95 . I wasn 't put on your plane so you could make me a better person , Coulson ! You put me here to make the hard call , and I made it . That 's not what I asked you , Agent Ward . I answered your question . I wasn 't working with anybody . I take full responsibility for my own actions . Then what ... - What ? - We have a problem . Put it down . Put it down , May ! It 's not what you think , Coulson . It 's just an ICER . This one 's not . It 's real , with real bullets . So you better put yours down and tell me what the hell 's going on . Right now . - L ... - Now ! I can 't . You better listen to the man , Agent May . You have no idea what you 're doing . Maybe not , but I know you 're not fast enough to take us both . Look , I can explain everything , but not here . Why not here ? You have to check with someone first ? Using that encrypted phone in the cockpit ? Who 's on the other end of that line , May ? I can 't say . That 's okay . I think I know . It makes sense now why Deathlok put Blake in critical condition , and left you alive and well . Why he led us to the track , only to disappear , instead of defending his boss . Why would he do that ? Because that wasn 't his boss , was it ? Was it ? - What are you talking about ? - Stop lying to me ! Who do you answer to ? Who 's the real Clairvoyant ? What did you do ? Where are we going ? I don 't know . I didn 't do it , Phil ! I don 't know what 's happening here ! I swear ! If you 're not doing this , who is ? When that plane touches down , take out everyone on board . Except Agent Coulson . He 's mine .

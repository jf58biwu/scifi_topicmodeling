 This is Cameron . Hello ? I 'm looking for ice cream . Uh , ice cream , end of the aisle . It 's time to kill . Excuse me ? Hey , you free on Saturday , Hicks ? You want to take a shift for Hector ? Yeah , sure . Time to kill , Hicks ? Pull the trigger . Time to ... Kill . It 's time . Pull the trigger . It 's time to kill . Pull the trigger . Pull the trigger . Time to kill , Hicks . It 's time to kill . Pull the trigger . It 's time to kill . Pull the trigger . He 's inside . Well hello , Don . Just come right in , please . You eating grass again ? It 's Asian pennywort . It increases the blood flow and oxygen to the brain . It 's quite an eye-opener . Want a bite ? I don 't eat shrubs . For you . Well , this seems ... Sticky . No kidding . People are asking questions to which answers are scarce . Well , I understand , but my group ... Has deniability , Rosen . It doesn 't technically exist so you do this for me and don 't bust my balls . So refreshingly candid , Don . What the hell are you wearing ? I try to swim two miles each day . Look , this is important . Lives are at stake . Um , that 's not exactly coffee . It 's a kind of Ayurvedic roasted barley grain . You 're welcome to it , but ... By the way , Lee , get a new doorbell . Sign right here , ma 'am . You 're lucky I didn 't take you in for reckless driving . I really appreciate it . Can you do me a favor and take your glasses off ? Take this ticket and eat it . There you go . The carbon too . Are you single or ... Have a nice day , Officer . I spoke to Donna . Have you seen my keys ? Uh , check the front cupboard . She and Jerry want us to come to the shore this weekend . Yeah , they 're not over there . They say they 've been trying to get in touch with you . I know . Uh , they 're not here . It 's just going to be more awkward after the hearing when you 're back on the job . I know . Please , can you focus with me ? Help me find my keys . Bill . Bill , stop . Just stop . Eye contact . Deep breath . Have you checked your other jacket ? I 've checked my jacket . Your other jacket . Right . What do you know ? This is why I married you . Ah . You okay ? I love you . I feel sorry for you , woman . Hey , hey . Thank you . Love you . You too . Say hi to Dr. Rosen . You got a problem ? Rachel , where 's your mother ? She 'll be down in a second . Hey , Sam , can you hem this for me ? Just an inch . Please . Any shorter , it 's a miniskirt . It still covers my knees , Papa . Don 't start . And don 't wait up , okay ? I 'm going to be working late again , okay ? Again ? Again . What else is new ? Don 't worry . Be careful . She 's 24 . Breaking her mother 's heart . ... looking for a husband . Not that she 'd get one with her condition . You almost ready , Gary ? Gary . You want your cereal ? Here . You 'll like this one . Mmm . Mmm . Omega three . Omega . Two fluid ounces . Mmm . Mmm . Gary , stop watching the TV . Or whatever . Poof . Disappear . They 're almost here . Hey . Good morning . Hey , Gary . Hey . Cool jacket . It 's new . Yeah . Touch it . This is good for him , Sandra . You know , it 's human interaction . It 's normal activities . It 's all good . Okay . Now you 're just trying to make me feel better . Oh , well , you should feel better . You deserve to . Well , at least I can get to the salon now . He really hates that place . I can drive . No , he can 't . He can 't drive . Yeah , I think your hair looks lovely just the way it is . Thank you . Have a good day . Bye . Bye . Thanks , Gary . You should have made this coffee stronger . Uh , you could make it yourself next time . I 'm putting my lunch in the refrigerator . Hey , Gary . Okay . Good morning . My mother doesn 't want me to eat fast food so I have to eat what she makes me . Got it . That 's why my name is on it . Don 't eat what 's inside my bag . So , what you 're saying is I can eat your sandwich , right ? No , don 't ! That 's why my name is on it . No , I changed my name to Gary too . Bill . It 's a lie . What ? I 'm joking . It 's a joke . Conference room , two minutes , you guys . You 're not funny . You don 't get it . You don 't get it . I don 't get it ? Nobody laughs . It 's not funny . Good morning , Nina . Bill . Morning , sir . My apologies for starting the morning so abruptly but we have an urgent matter . Rachel , over here please . Um , what we 're going to see is security footage from a camera in interrogation room three at Police Headquarters in Manhattan . Ready ? Uh , yes . This information you acquired , the encryptions were considered unbreakable . Maybe it just came to me like ... Like the notes of a song . Now watch this . This is where it gets interesting . Uh , Mr. Keeler , tell us more ... Oh , I 'm sorry . One moment . Must be this input . It 's not the laptop . If I fix it , I can get to drive the car . Uh , well , we 'll see . Dr. Rosen , how about you just explain it to us then ? Of course . Um , NYPD brought in a suspect involved in blackmail , extortion and certain activities that caught the attention of our generous patron Don Wilson . It just comes to me like the notes of a song . That 's funny . Mr. Keeler , could you , uh , tell us more about the method you 're describing ? I 've already told you enough . The prisoner was killed instantly . I don 't see a gun . Oh , you fixed it . Wonderful . Uh . It was the VGA display port . Ah . Thank you , Gary . Right , so Wilson was in the room , right ? What 's his take ? Uh , he 's stumped . The room was sealed , single door and no windows and no gun was found . So maybe someone manipulated the footage . All tampering was ruled out . This is ... This is a classic locked room mystery . Hate those . So we need real eyes on the scene , right ? So , I ideally a CSI ... Real eyes ? Forensics team from Quantico . Real eyes means real eyes looking real closely . So we 're on our own again ? Uh , I appreciate your patience , Bill . I 'm on it . I fixed the TV , Dr. Rosen . I fixed the TV , I 'm the driver . Absolutely not . Shoot . Does anybody have any change for the meter ? Change ? Yeah . Yeah , I don 't carry change . Don 't you have a credit card ? Yeah . Yeah , they take credit cards . Okay . Hey guys , take some change . I 'm going to see what 's going on . Nina ? Yeah ? Can you get inside the room ? Stupid question . I don 't even think I 'd know how to walk in those . I 've got a closet full of these . I 'll hook you up . Are you serious ? Hook me up . You want some stilettos , Gary ? Yeah . Hook me up . Do you mind if we take a quick peek ? Who are you with exactly ? We can 't ... We can 't tell you , but we can do things that we 're not supposed to talk about . That 's why we can solve this . It 's okay , Gary . Also why you need to stop bugging us . Gary , that 's enough . You have to let us do what we need to do . That 's enough . It shouldn 't be a problem . Excuse me ? The problem is all the water you drank . You have to go so badly , it must be hard for you to stand there . You really have to go . I really got to go . Take your time . You did it to her , didn 't you ? Dr. Rosen says that we 're not supposed to use our skills ... Gary . Chill . Unless it 's an emergency . Chill . We got five minutes . Tops . I 'm just telling you what Dr. Rosen said . Gary . Please , just look for clues . Hey , what do you got ? She can 't hear you . She 's doing a visual . Right . So I got details on the slug . She can 't hear you . You don 't need to whisper . Right . It 's a .30 caliber . That 's from a rifle . Well , how did someone sneak a rifle in a room like this ? It 's a good question . Does anybody know where this vent goes ? Well , this is very dramatic . Can 't wait to hear what you 've got to tell me . Hmm ? Uh , the shooter was here , Dr. Rosen facing east towards police headquarters . Come here . I 'll show you . Here . Gary . Over here . The shooter , he lined up his shot aiming at a vent on the western face of the building . That 's exactly what I said . She can read The New York Times from ten blocks away . Let her roll . He fired a single bullet . The bullet entered the building at a 30 degree angle . It traveled through an air shaft and then collided with an interior vent at the interrogation room . And ricocheted right into the victim . Sorry , you forgot the part about the bird that farted in New Jersey . I thought that that was funny . That 's funny , a bird fart . Thank you , Gary . Someone has a sense of humor . Well , I like it , but is there any evidence to corroborate this elegant hypothesis ? What about this for evidence ? Hey , whatever that is , leave it alone . I 'll be damned . It 's a .30 caliber . Good work . The clinical term for it is hyperkinesis . It 's a rare condition , Iike someone who has perfect pitch . Extraordinary balance , perfect aim . And perfect synchrony between thought and action . Like a Peyton Manning with a gun ? Yes . Hyperkenetics often show an impressive but sporadic aptitude for sports . And not just riflery or hunting . Table tennis ? Figure skating ? Bowling , archery , ping pong ... Oh , ping pong is table tennis . Rachel , um , did you get a peak at the bullet casing ? Um , I ... Uh ... There wasn 't a print , but I 'm going to take a closer look . Football , British , golf , miniature golf . Does he ever stop ? Hey , you shut up . Gary , what did we talk about ? He started it . And then how do we end it ? I stop . So , um , basically we 're looking for an athlete . And relatedly , someone who might have a predilection to over-stimulus , self-medication ... Join the club . Possible addiction . Even a criminal record . So , we 've got an athlete , drug addict , sniper which means some sort of military training . Starting to look like a real criminal profile , which would mean this is almost like a professional investigation . Whatever , Bill . I 'm going to go see what I can find out . Whatever , Bill . Whatever , Bill . Okay . Okay . I 'll be back . Gary ? I have a bad attitude . ? Small Jean Genie snuck off to the city ? Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers ? And ate all your razors while pulling the waiters ? Talking about Monroe and walking on Snow White ? New York 's a go-go and everything tastes nice ? Poor little greenie ? The Jean Genie lives on his back ? The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks ? He 's outrageous he screams and he bawls ? The Jean Genie let yourself go ? Oh ... ? Sits like a man but he smiles like a reptile ? He says he 's a beautician and sells you nutrition ... ? Make this quick . Look at these . Japanese import , " Children of the Revolution . " Hard to believe Marc Bolan started his career in a skiffle band . What do you want ? I want to know what you 've gotten us into . You know what you need to know . I 'm afraid I don 't . And I 'm not going to move forward until I do . You jump when ... So hostile . You weren 't breast-fed , were you ? Yeah , yeah , yeah , whatever you say . You think I 'd put these people in danger on your word alone , Don ? Think again . So , some answers please . Okay . Red Flag . Chew on that . The Alpha group ? The extremists ? You call them extremists , I call them criminals , terrorists . Yeah , but I thought we shut them down . We did , but they 're back . And now they 're expanding from networking Alphas into human trafficking , drugs . And murder . You saw the tape . Red Flag put a bullet in our only witness . Now you know what I know . Can I ... Scout 's honor ? On my mother 's grave . How long has he been back on active ? Persky ? A couple weeks , I think . Well , he looks fine to me . Two surgeries , I heard . Do you mind ? Do I mind what ? Well , technically I 'm not supposed to share it out of department . This is a joint op . I still do have my badge , all right ? Not if it was up to Persky . Yeah , well , forget him . How many of these damn things did you pull ? You wanted vets with PTSD and a list of priors . That 's not a short list . What do you do , Bill ? On one week you come in , you ask for a file on a 100-year-old Russian chess master and now it 's military snipers with a history of going nuts . What is it ? I 'm rehearsing for Jeopardy . Any luck with those files ? Oh , yeah , thank you . Don 't forget who hooked you up . Oh , this looks delicious . Mmm . This is really good . Thank you . Bill . Rachel , where are we ? Anything yet ? Um , well , we didn 't actually get a fingerprint off the bullet casing , but I did manage to pull some biological residue . Traces of citrus rind , nicotine , pharmaceuticals , and , um ... Is there something bothering you , Rachel ? It 's nothing . It 's nothing really . No ? Oh . Indulge me . Please . It 's Bill . He 's ... He 's messy and he 's rude and he just ... He takes things without asking and ... Yes , I ... I , no , I understand . Bill has some boundary issues . Some ? Well , we 're working on them . You know , the best thing for him is ... And for you , is to confront him and tell him how you feel or what you need . No . Um , I just ... I can 't . I 'm sorry . Yes , you can . No . You did just now with me . That wasn 't so difficult , was it ? Yes , it was ... It was ... It was ... Oh , good . So you 'll tell him . Now you were saying . Residue , citrus rind and nicotine ? Oh , yes , and an enzyme found only in Caucasians of northern European ancestry . So , our assassin is what ? A jittery orange eater from Norway ? Uh , anyway , that winnowed our search down from 10,000 to less than 300 suspects , which I then cross-referenced with Harken 's list from the FBI and that left us with 40 potential shooters . Gary 's checking their names for a match . That 's ... That 's great work . Thank you . It 's going to make our job a whole lot easier . You guys need to see this . Whoo ! That 's two strikes . Run ! Run ! Yeah , that 's him . That 's Hicks . Number seven . We sure we got the right guy ? Is that him ? Absolutely . Cameron Hicks . He 's the highest rated marksman in the history of the Corps . Never fired a shot in combat , but his testing is off the chart . Something is wrong here . A deadly assassin working in a grocery store ? A hot deadly assassin , but why would he ? You 're an absolute mess , woman . Have you no shame ? What ? I like the blue collar look . I know you do . And the bad boy thing . I 'm sure . Please . You 're just grumpy . No , I 'm not . Yeah , you 're grumpy . You should mellow . You 're hung over . You always drink . I had one beer . And ... And two tequila shots . - You like alcohol . Which is like breakfast for me . Okay . You drink beer for breakfast ? I like cereal . I have a special mixture . Hey , Hicks . What are you doing here ? You walked out in the middle of last shift . You never came back . You never called . Uh , no , I , uh ... Look , I just , um , I stepped out for a minute . You on drugs , my man ? No . I 'm sorry . Company policy . Oh , come on , look , you don 't have to do this . I have no choice . Here he comes . There , there he is . He 's walking south . Okay , Gary . His ... His apartment is five blocks south from here . His apartment ? Rachel 's at his apartment . Yes . I told her in and out . She needed a little longer . Guys , in the field , when I give you orders , you take them . They are my orders . Rachel , out now . Rachel , copy ? Get out . Rachel , out of there now . Rachel . Rachel ? See , she 's not listening . What about her cell phone ? Rachel . She 's not listening . Amateurs . There he is . Keep trying her . I 'm going in . I 'm on it . Hey , you guys , I found something . Get out of there . What ? Rachel , he 's coming ! Get out of there ! Hey ! What the hell are you doing ? FBI . Hold it ! On the ground now ! Okay ! Okay ! Now ! Yeah , come on . What the hell did you do to my car ? Careful , Gary ! Okay ? Ah ! You 've been going for five minutes . That 's okay . I can get him . You 're spiking , okay ? Rachel , what do you hear ? He 's running ... He 's running past a cafe and there 's a street musician in front and , um , there 's a street musician . Okay , Gary , help us out . Just left the park , heading into an alley three blocks north . Okay . I 'm on it . No . No , no , you need to stay . You need to stay put . Cameron , just stop . Who are you ? Just wait . I 'm not going to hurt you . Why are you chasing me ? Why are you running ? I don 't know . It 's okay . Just calm down . There you go . You must be tired . Exhausted , right ? Yeah . Little weak ? Just go to sleep . Everything will be all right . Just go to sleep . Just relax , Mr. Hicks . Ooh , Dr. Rosen , what is this ? A lesion . That 's not more than a week old . Prepare 50 CC 's . Okay . He shouldn 't be here , Nina . That is my point . Something 's off . Of course something 's off . I whip out my cuffs , the perp ends up in FBI or police custody . It 's that simple . Bill , I mean he had no idea why we were following him . He 's guilty . Okay ? He reminds me of the people I push . He seemed confused , disorientated . Yeah , it 's called being a crack head , okay ? We 're not talking ... It 's not as simple as ... Crystal meth maybe where you 're from ? I don 't know . Bill ... Bill ! I don 't know . Drug addicts ? Excuse me , guys . Excuse me . Excuse me . Nina , confused . What do you mean ? I don 't think he knew what he was doing . You don 't think he knew what he was doing ? Controlling the will of another mind is not a new trick . Hypnotists , charismatics , religious leaders , all of them manipulate the neural structure of the brain to get their desired results . Not to mention our very own Nina , here . Now , it normally starts in the frontal lobe . Nina 's pushing , for example , causes a micro-seizure in this region . It 's a temporary effect , which fades in minutes . Not on me . It doesn 't work on me . You 're right , Gary , because the success of Nina 's pushing is dependent on the plasticity of the subject brain so it 's not always effective . Right . What does this have to do with ... What does it have to do with the shooter ? This is the shooter 's brain . And here we have a mass of abnormal size . My guess is that the induction in this case is long-Iasting and far more substantial . All right , so , what the hell does this mean ? That 's a very good question , Bill . Don . Another donut shop . Since they 've opened , I 've had to add another 20 laps to my swim . You know half these places are just a front . We need to talk about the shooter . One on every corner . More donuts than could possibly be consumed . You know 40 % of all small businesses are owned by foreign nationals ? You know that 's simply not true . It could be . You don 't know . Tell me about the shooter . He was brainwashed . Why would you say something like that ? Because it 's true . I ran an MRI . He has an abnormal growth . This isn 't good . Don , my team is at risk . You ever heard of the Ghost files ? No , don 't answer . Of course not . What Ghost files ? I never asked you that . No , I 'm asking you . What ? What ? Why do I feel I 'm in a Beckett play when I talk to you ? I don 't know who that is , okay ? Murders , patsy , innocent man on the street , a perpetrator we know next to nothing about , but people end up dead . Lovely . A man we sent in to infiltrate Red Flag last year died when a taxi swerved into him , killing them both . Another one of our informants ? Gutted by his cleaning lady , who then slit her own throat . The only evidence linking these two killings ? A bump in the brain . Not good is a bit of an understatement . Well , I 'm sure you can handle it . You 're always telling me how special your people are . You could have told me about this before . " I swear on my mother 's grave . " She 's cremated . Go get the Ghost before he gets someone else . You 're late , four minutes . I got held up . I couldn 't get a positive ID on any of them . Checked federal records , other sources , even DMV , there 's nothing there . They 've been scrubbed . This 'll do . I have one more thing to pass on . Our superiors are worried and they want to accelerate the schedule . I told them I work on my own schedule . I planned this out with extreme precision . Your arrival today has thrown everything off . It was just four minutes . I 'll tell you what , it won 't happen again . No , it won 't . This time , you will follow my instructions exactly . Follow the light please . And back . Thank you . Who are you ? I am a doctor . My name is Lee Rosen . Can you tell me what day it is ? I 'm not telling you anything . Look , this obviously isn 't a hospital so who exactly are you people ? What 's this ? You can trust me , Mr. Hicks . I 'm trying to help you . I 'm giving you an injection of topiramate . It interrupts the messages from your basal ganglia , countering any effects of forced induction . But I am more interested in your blackouts . You left work in the middle of the day ? How do you know about that ? What was the last thing you remember ? Please , Mr. Hicks , this is very important . What was the last thing you remember before you blacked out ? My ... My phone rang and then , oh , there was a sound like a tone or something . And then ? And then ... And then I don 't know . I guess it was the next day . And anything else ? Say , for example , aphasia ? Excuse me ? Difficulty reading , hearing wrong words . How could you possibly know that ? Mr. Hicks , please , in your own words , tell me what you experienced ? I , uh ... I couldn 't , I couldn 't understand what anyone was saying . And all the words , even the ones on the billboards , they just kept saying the same thing over and over again . Look , what 's wrong with me ? Nothing . Nothing ? If nothing 's wrong with me , then why am I locked up ? You killed a man , Mr. Hicks . Kill yourself . Hey , what are you doing ? Hey , you don 't drink that stuff , man ! No , no , no , stop , stop ! That stuff 's going to kill you ! What are you doing ? You can 't drink that stuff ! Stop ! So you 're saying I was brainwashed ? Yes . The aphasia is incidental . It 's a mere side effect of the location of the lesion . Look , assuming I actually believe you , why would someone do this to me ? Because you are an Alpha . I 'm a what ? You have a neurological difference that confers some exceptional advantage . But you 're not alone . Everyone on this unit is just like you , Cameron . They are all Alphas . No , I 'm ... I 'm not an Alpha . Disregard the term for the time being . Surely you 've wondered where your incredible gifts come from . Is it normal to pitch two perfect games in a row ? And not throw another strike until they boot my ass down to double-A ball ? No , it 's not normal , Doc , but it sure as hell isn 't a gift . Your hyperkinesis , it 's a delicate instrument , and when it falls out of tune , it crashes . All Alpha skills come with a downside , Cameron . I 'm sorry , okay , this whole thing is just ... Yeah , it 's hard to believe . Yeah , a little bit . Now , would you do me a favor and buy me a soda ? Seriously ? Yes . Please . But do it ... Do it from here . Come on . Look , I 'm a good shot , but that 's impossible . Well , try . Okay ? Again . Look , this is stupid . Our minds are capable of so much more than you think . Again . No . You focus on the moments when your remarkable skill fails you . But the potential is there . Clearly . What do you want from me ? I know you didn 't send your team out to hunt me down just to , uh , give me this little therapy session . You have barely scratched the surface of what you are capable of . Okay , so if this Ghost is actually involved . How do you track him ? Well , all his former proxies are dead . Mr. Hicks would not be alive if his work were complete . If this Ghost was not planning on using him again . So , I answer the phone then what ? Oh , you just go out there and kill someone else . Bill . Sounds like a really good plan to me . To answer your question , Mr. Hicks , Gary is our transducer which means that he can read a wide range of frequencies , including television , Wi-Fi and cell phone transmission . Except for Nokia . It 's a different protocol . So , when the call comes in , Gary will trace the signal back to its source . By scanning local antennae towers , I can create a splash grid . I 'm the cold Charlie . - What ? It 's a way of flushing out snipers . You put your helmet on the end of your rifle , stick it out there , sniper takes a shot , you clock his position , you nail him . Helmet on the end of the rifle . That 's the cold Charlie . And that 's me , right ? Catches on quick . I don 't see that we have much choice . You are aware , Mr. Hicks , that if the Ghost is still out there , you are very much at risk . Right . Gary , you got a lock on his cell ? Yes , I do . I 'm not going to argue this point . It 's a process issue , Lee , okay ? We 're moving into a whole new line of work here . You can 't hire amateurs for this type of deal . I ... I understand your frustration , Bill . But they can 't carry firearms . The equipment is ... Needs improvement , yes . I 'm actually jotting this down as we speak . It 's ... You know it 's very constructive . Constructive ? Yes , I ... I ... I hear your concerns and I will address them . You know what ? You 're using that shrink voice again . What voice is that ? If you keep doing that , I 'm going to hang up on you . Are you anxious about this operation or is it something else ? Water okay ? Sorry , it 's the strongest thing I got . Cute kid . Is that the ex ? Yeah . That 's Patti . Back when she used to put up with my crap . Comes with the territory . Yeah , Rosen gave me that speech . Of course , the whole downside speech . Spent more than five minutes with him , so why wouldn 't he ? Yeah . So , uh , what 's yours ? What 's my what ? What ? No , uh , no downside for you ? Well , I don 't count toothpicks or cut myself if that 's what you 're getting at . Yeah , no , but ... I live rent-free in a penthouse in Soho . I do what I want , take what I need , don 't answer to anyone . Except Rosen . Yeah , I work for Rosen . Yeah , so you answer to him . It 's a job . All right . Just , uh , just punching a clock , huh ? Look , if there 's something you want to know , you just ask . I 'm just saying , most people , if they could do what you do ... Would what ? But not you . You work with Rosen , you 're here helping me out . Maybe I 'm just a really nice person . I don 't know . Are you ? No . What do I do ? Answer it . Hello ? Okay , so , what do I do ? Give him the Topiramate . You sure this 'll work ? Yes , conceivably , one could also stimulate a primal emotional response to overwhelm the programing ... Okay , whoa , whoa , whoa , just back up . What ? Just give him the shot . Okay , you 're fine . Uh , Gary , any luck with the signal ? I got it . I 'll get in the back . How are we doing ? Gary 's tracking it . We 're close . It 's there . This is it . It 's here . It 's this . Coming from the sixth floor . You 're sure ? Yes . Okay . We 've got a midtown hotel location . I 'm going to put the team in place and move in . Copy that ? I 'll be right there . Nina , with me . Yeah . Rachel , I need you stay here and make sure the car does not get towed . Okay . Gary , I need you to keep feeding me intel . I need to know if he moves an inch . Yes , yes , intel . How can I help ? You ... You can help by not killing anyone today . The guy brainwashed me . You take these off ... Harken , I can help . You can take these off when it 's over . Rachel . Let 's go , Nina . I 'm going up to six . Let me know when you get a room number . Okay . Can you hear me ? Uh-huh . Yes , signal isn 't moving . I need a list of your current guests on the sixth floor . Uh , I don 't know what that is and I 'm going to need a search warrant . Right . Huh . Look . Here 's my search warrant right here . Here . This is a search warrant . Yeah , let me get that information for you . I need a room number , Nina . Yeah , I 'm working on it , Bill . Single guest that 's been here for longer than a week . Okay , I 'm trying . Just give me one second . I got a bellhop here . I 'm almost there , Bill . Just keep your panties on . Nina , I need the number . Okay , room 613 . Room 613 . Room 613 . That 's the room the bellman just went in . I 'm going in . Look , Rachel , look , he 's going to need some help . You 've got to let me out . Please . I can 't . Get down ! I lost him . West stairwell . Rachel , come on ! He 's getting away ! All right . Get your guys to block all these exits . Don 't let anyone through . Excuse me . What ? Tell your guys to block all these exits . Come on ! Get these exits blocked ! Here . I need this too . Okay . Hicks ? I 'm on it ! Hicks ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! Hicks ? I got him . Get up . Nice and easy . Nice and easy . Get down ! Get down ! Get down ! Stop ! I got him ! Stop ! No ! - Stop ! Oh , my God , he just jumped . All right , copy that . What happened ? Where am I ? It 's over . You okay ? Yeah . Thanks . I don 't know . It doesn 't make sense to me . I mean why would he jump ? You okay ? Yeah . Just bad memories . Right . Oh , look , look , here 's the angle of the shot . Just as you said . Every single moment was planned . Well , I 've had several patients who have exhibited this kind of obsessive compulsive behavior . I would like to take this with us . Gray suits . Gray suit , dark coat . Look at this . It 's strange that someone with such a compulsive methodology would deviate from it . Using Hicks a second time . Yes . Whoever he was after must have been extremely important . You okay ? I 'm gonna be fine . Thanks . You did good . I made a mess of this thing . Should have kept it more contained . Yeah , I guess in that case you blew it . We 're heading back to the office . Rosen wants me to stay and spin the story so you guys go ahead . Leaving the part about the Alphas and the brainwashing out ? Good luck with that . Tell me about it . You did a good job , Hicks . Thanks . Nina , I need both of you in the ... In the van , okay ? Sure . I was just trying to make sure no one got hurt . No , I ... I understand . Thank you . I have no idea . You 're asking me but I don 't know , okay ? What are you looking at ? It would have been nice to get some scans . You think so ? It also would be nice if I didn 't have every department in the city asking for explanations I can 't give . Why are you upset , Don ? Home team won this one , didn 't it ? I can have two conflicting emotions at the same time , Rosen . I 'm complicated that way . And don 't think I forgot about your shooter . I know how your mind works . You do ? I 'm coming for him . Um , we should talk about that . We just did . Don , he ... He was ... He was a big help to us and I think I can help him . I don 't care . Go . Something still does not make sense . The Ghost chose proxies who were consistently average . Housekeeper , taxicab driver , man on the street , but this time , he chooses an Alpha . Hicks is the only one who makes that shot . Yes , and that 's just it . This plan is so complex and was executed perfectly . It was bound to draw some attention . Well , maybe he got sloppy . There 's no ... No , that is very unlikely . So , what happens to Hicks ? Wilson sends him to the compound ? Oh , I don 't think so . He 's not a prisoner . And Wilson sees the distinction ? Well , there are rules , Nina . And Bill is right . We simply can 't keep him here . Well , he helped us . Uh , the man shot a federal witness . The situation is a bit more complicated . Was it complicated with me ? Nina , that was a long time ago before any of this . You can 't compare the two . I think I just did . Who 's Tyler ? What 's a southpaw ? He 's my kid . He 's a pitcher . Gary , don 't read my texts . You still here ? Yeah . Rosen said he wanted to talk , so . Maybe you should come back tomorrow . I mean , he could be a while . You think ? I 'm taking Gary home . I 'll drop you off . No , Dr. Rosen is driving me . It 's a change of plans . We should go . Yeah , sure . Nice ride . Thanks . I borrowed it . No . No . No . Gary , you okay ? No , no , no . It 's ... It 's back again . Gary , what 's back ? It 's back again . The ... The signal . This yellow and blue . The signal . The signal . Hang on . You see something ? The signal . Gary , calm down . It 's the cell phone . The cell phone . Wait , what ? The Ghost ? Yes . Are you sure ? Yes . Yes , he 's here . Gary ... Gary , look at me . Gary , what direction ? It 's there . He 's over there . Okay . Okay . Okay . Hey , take care of him and warn Rosen . Gary , get in the car and lock the door , okay ? I need the keys . No , just get in the car . I 'm serious . Ten and 2 : 00 . Hello , Don . I know what you 're going to say , but ... Rosen , stop . That 's not what I called about . We 've got a big problem . We 've got the wrong body . The guy who jumped off the roof wasn 't the Ghost . He 's the damn bellhop . Are you sure ? I 'm looking at him right now , which raises the question , who was the guy in the room and where is he now ? We had it all wrong . The whole case was a setup from the very beginning . Why else the miracle shot ? Why choose an Alpha ? We were supposed to find it . Hicks was the cold Charlie . We thought we were using Hicks to draw out the Ghost but Red Flag was using him all along . To identify their real target . What real target ? Come on , Don . Who 's done more to disrupt Red Flag 's operations ? Who 's the biggest thorn in their side ? Us . Okay , we don 't have the Ghost , now the Ghost 's after us . How about your man in the room ? Did he see him ? Rosen , what about Harken ? Can he help us out ? I 'm afraid it 's too late for that , Don ! Be still . Hey , let her go ! Not a step closer , Mr. Hicks or she dies ! Bill ? Bill , try and hear me . Bill , I am your friend . I am your friend , Bill . I know what you 're thinking . You 're thinking you can make that shot without hitting her . But I know you . No , you don 't know me . I 've researched you extensively , without my hand to guide you , you 're helpless . Every time the pressure 's on , you fall apart . I am your friend , Bill . Bill , kill me , please . Kill us all . Stop ! Bill . Look at me . Listen to me . Don 't do it . Don 't kill him . It 's not working , Nina . He 's ... He 's too far gone . Bill , Bill , please . You know who I am . I am your friend . Bill , please . The only way you make that shot is if I tell you to . You let me go , I let her go . It 's as easy as ... Are you okay ? Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! You 're on the wrong side of this , Hicks . What ? You 're on the wrong side of this . There are still a few traces of anomalous activity in the pre-frontal cortex but it 's substantially diminished . The lesion seems to be dissolving . And you , how are you ? I 'm going to be okay . Good . The side effects shouldn 't last more than a few days . But you have experienced significant trauma and in the coming weeks , you may find emotions welling up inside you . Right . Feelings of , uh ... Of sadness , and of course fatigue . I 'll keep that in mind , Oprah . My door is always open , Bill . Thanks , Dr. Rosen . How are you ? I heard you snuck one on me . Glad to see you 're back to normal . Want a ride , Rach ? He has your arm . Yeah . Not quite . Maybe with practice . Maybe . It 's hard being apart from them , isn 't it ? Yeah . Yeah , but I get it . I drive her nuts . Well , it 's not entirely your fault , is it ? Patti has no idea what you go through . Something you want to tell me , Doc ? There is so much that I can do to help you . There 's much that you could do to help us . Yeah , I know . And look , I appreciate it . Really , I do , Dr. Rosen . I know you got my back . I 'm not asking you ... No , I know what you 're asking . Believe me . I get it . But I worked for the government before . It didn 't really turn out ... Cameron . The thing is I just , uh ... I 've kind of always been better off on my own , you know ? Of course . I completely understand . Thanks . But , you did murder a federal prisoner . But I ... I couldn 't control that . I mean you ... You of all people know that . I know that and you know that , but there are other parties that might not be so understanding . No , the best place for you now is with us . Where I can protect you . Come by tomorrow . We 'll get you situated . You 're back on the mound , Mr. Hicks .

 Ripped By mstoll Hey ! Royal salute ! Present arms ! God save King George ! Soldiers , your firearms ! Stand at ease ! You owe me a debt . Please . Three cheers for His Majesty , King George . - Hip hip ! - Huzzah ! Easy , lad . Easy . We 're getting you out of here . Aye ! Is he alive ? Aye , he needs tending , but it 'll have to wait . The hell it will ! I can 't believe you actually did it . Those Redcoat drummer boys were making such a racket , the garrison didn 't know we were there , cattle and all , until we were inside the place . We must make haste . They 'll be coming for us straight away . God . What did Randall do to you ? I don 't mean to speak ill of the lad , but he positively reeks . It 's oil of lavender . It 's used to relieve pain . Someone tried to tend him , then ? Maybe . Go back and watch the road behind us . If ye see any sign of pursuit , come running like the devil and we 'll have to take our chances . - Jamie . - Come on ! Jamie . You 're safe now . I 'm going to help you , I swear . Get off her , lad ! Jamie ! What 's wrong with ye , lad ? It 's Claire ! Dinna touch me ! She 's just trying to help ye . What is he saying ? He 's deleeriet . Raving about God knows what . Pardon the interruption , but will ye be wanting tea ? Or can I get this wagon moving ? Father Anselm , this is Mrs. Claire Fraser . The Father 's agreed to give us shelter until we can find a more permanent situation . Thank you . We 're most grateful . Think nothing of it . We shall talk later . - I 'm going to need ... - The boy has told us of your needs and all is waiting for you . Thank you . No , no . Jamie . It 's all right . There 's more broth . I 've no doubt you can mend his body , but there are other wounds , not so easily dealt with . His soul , I 'm afraid , is in turmoil . If I don 't set that hand , he 'll be crippled for life . Claire . Please . Excuse us . Brother Paul was right . You need your nourishment . Dinna touch me . Jamie , talk to me . What did Randall do to you ? Too much . And not enough . You saw her leave these walls ? Yes . We are both men of our word . Drink . Ah , ah , ah . Let 's see if we can make you more comfortable . This will hurt . It 's all right . It 's all right . The worst is over now , you 'll see . Dear God . You are a magnificent creature . It 's like kissing a corpse . I know you can do better . My men can have Claire back here within the hour . We have an agreement . That I would not resist . Ah . So that 's your plan . To submit , but like Christ on the cross . Well , we will see about that . Shh . How does that feel ? Is that nice ? Don 't play the worm with me . Jamie , I just want this to be a pleasant experience for us both . Do what you must . Take yer pleasure and be done with it . What I must ? You think I cannot control the darkness I inhabit . One way or another , I will get a response from you . Scream . Scream . Scream ! Scream ! Ye 'd be wise to do as she says , lad . The laudanum will help ye sleep through this trying time . Whiskey will do me fine . Jamie , I 'm about to set nine bones in your hand . Randall made me crawl . Made me beg . Before he was done , he made me want verra badly to be dead . Well , you 're not dead , and I refuse to let you spend the rest of your life a cripple . So let me do my job . Do as you wish . It matters not to me . Jamie . I need water and clean cloth . I have them ready for ye . They 're over near the basins . What about thread ? I have clean thread , too . Scream . Scream . Scream ! During the war , I had treated men in far worse shape , their horrific injuries almost unfathomable to the human mind , but none of them were my husband . It was a long , nerve-wracking job . Some parts , such as the splinting of the two fingers with simple fractures went quite easily . Other 's did not . Setting his middle finger required exerting considerable force in order to draw the ends of the splintered bone back through the skin . Jamie had said to me once , " I can bear pain myself , " but I could not bear yours . " That would take more strength than I have . " He was right . It did take strength . I hoped that each of us had enough . I began to lose awareness of anything outside the job I was doing . I was afraid of infection , particularly , but otherwise was fairly sure the fingers would heal . The shattered joint would likely leave him with a stiff ring finger , but the others might function normally in time . I will stay with him through the night . You 'll need your strength . Come . I will send for you , should he awaken , or there be any need . I 'm sorry , I didn 't mean to interrupt your prayers . I wasn 't exactly praying . I was just sitting here alone , trying to clear my head . Were you indeed alone ? Please . Would you like me to hear your confession ? I 'm not sure any of it would make any sense to you . Perhaps not . But I assure you , he will understand . My name is Claire Beauchamp Randall Fraser . Through my selfishness , I have brought great suffering , to both my husbands . Go on . Eight months ago , I was on holiday with my husband in Inverness , in the year of our Lord , 1945 . I told him everything . I happened upon some standing stones ... Exactly like my husband ... Traveled back 200 years in time ... He attacked me ... Was rescued by my Highlander ... I know I was already married ... He had become a friend ... I found myself very much in love ... Seemed like the only solution ... He was prepared to let me go ... I couldn 't leave him ... I was accused of being a witch ... Jamie came to my rescue ... Captain Randall , did the most unspeakable things to him . But it 's my fault . How marvelous . Extraordinary ! A miracle , perhaps . A miracle ? Somehow , I don 't think canon law was constructed with my situation in mind . True . But , our Lord sees the truth in all things . And so he knows your truth as well . Whatever your sins might be , have faith that they will be forgiven . Mmm . How 's our patient this morning ? Stubborn . Very stubborn . He still refuses any food . You need sustenance . He has a fever . I was afraid of that . It 's looking better . Once we have you healed up , we can begin a regime of massage and exercise , see if we can 't get that ring finger bending properly . We need to get his fever down . I 'll need a bucket of the coldest water you can find . The burn is icy in the mornings . That 'll do . And also plenty of clean cloth . I 'll see you get all you need . Thank you . You canna save a man that doesna want saving . Hey , go on . Staying sober isna going to heal Jamie any faster , eh ? It 's not his wounds I 'm worried about . It 's the not eating . Same thing happened to my uncle . Tree fell on him . His arm . Lost it up to the shoulder . Couldna stop fretting about it . Refused to take even a mouthful of bread . What happened to him ? Starved himself to death . Not that I 'm comparing Jaime to ... Ah ! Am I close ? Have you reached your limit yet ? What shall I do with you ? Claire . What is her power ? Possesses you even now ? What is her secret ? Tell me . She 's gone . There 's no more Claire . Then are you mine ? Are you mine ? You . There 's only you . Show me . Show me you 're mine . Huh ? Show me . Do it . I spotted two Redcoat patrols . - But they dinna see you ? - No . One was headed south , the other east . Lucky for us . Won 't be long before they head north . The monastery 's no place for a fight . It 's time we made plans . It 's clear Jamie 's not thriving here . Go where ? There 's no place safe for ye in Scotland . Not Leoch , not Lallybroch . Ye 'll have to flee the country . The MacKenzies know people in Paris . They can take ye in , provide shelter , eh ? There are Frasers in France as well . Jamie and I have a cousin . The man 's a merchant . He couldna fight sleep . You need someone who can defend against ... Mistress Claire , do you not have yer own family in France ? Is that not where you were headed when we first encountered ye ? Perhaps they would take ye in ? Yes , but they were relatives of my late husband and most likely wouldn 't welcome me in my current circumstances . I think Jamie would prefer to be with members of the Fraser clan . - No offense . - None taken . The offer stands . Aye . The MacKenzies will always stand with ye . I know they will . Thank you . Then I best secure us a ship . Jaime . Murtagh 's gone to find a boat . For France , where ye can forget this ever happened . Ye need to keep yer strength up . Ye must eat for ... For Mistress Claire 's sake if not for yer own . She loves you fiercely and ye have her worried sick . Tell me what I can do to help . Jamie . Yer blade . Hand it over . And what would ye be needing it for ? To put me out of this black misery . Jamie , ye don 't mean it . It 's not a matter I wish to discuss . - Now , hand it over . - No . - Give it to me . - No , I won 't . I was just coming to see you . Got us passage on a ship . The Cristabel . It 's a bit dear . Fifty coin in gold , but it 's safe . Willie said Jamie asked him to kill him . Did you know ? I wanted to tell you , but he made me pledge not to . I 've been praying ye 'd be able to talk some sense into the lad . That he 'd come around . Why ? Why does he want to die so badly ? He 's been tortured . Raped . Isn 't that reason enough ? No . Aye . The lad 's taken his share of punishment , but I can 't help feeling there 's more here than we know . I 'm sorry , Claire . I 'm truly sorry . I 'd never do anything to hurt that lad ... Unless . Unless ? I 'll not watch Jamie waste away . Die like an animal in the woods with his foot caught in a trap . If it comes to the time when he 's past the point of healing ... There we go . Feeling better ? Whoa . Whoa , whoa . Ye collapsed like a sack of grain . Scared the piss right out of me . Pardon me , Brother . What am I going to do ? About Jamie ? Well , his wounds are progressing nicely , but his soul remains possessed by darkness . I fear he will writhe in torment until he makes an end of himself . Unless he can be led back into the light . I don 't mean to disagree with ye , Brother , but I know Jamie . And light or no light , none can lead him where he doesna want to go . Are ye saying the lad 's doomed ? I 'm saying that maybe the only way to save Jamie is for someone to step into the darkness with him . Breathe in . Oil of lavender . Smells familiar , doesn 't it ? What are you doing ? Leave me be ! I 've left you be for far too long . Treated you too gently . That doesn 't work with you , does it ? No , you only respond to strength . Why are you doing this ? You know why ! To find out exactly what happened in that room between you and Randall . What you 're holding back . You already know . The obvious , yes , but what else ? There is no else . Then why can 't you look at me ? Look at me ! Do it ! - Look at me ! - No ! No ! Claire , please ! I don 't want to hurt you . It 's a bit late for that , isn 't it ? My husband wants to kill himself and he won 't tell me why ! Do you want me to hate you ? - Do you want me to hate you ! - No ! He branded you ? Jamie , what he did to you doesn 't mean that ... No , you 're wrong . He didn 't brand me . I did it myself . - We can remove it . - No . You canna understand . Claire . It wasn 't ... Randall didn 't just use force to get what he wanted from me . Claire , it wasn 't ... Go on . Say it . He made love to me , Claire . And I ... What ? Breathe in . That 's oil of lavender . These are Claire 's hands . Think of Claire . Think of your wife . Wait for me . Claire 's here . Say my name , Jamie . Say my name . Claire . I understand . How could she ever forgive you ? I couldna help myself , Claire . It felt so good . Not to be in pain . Were you afraid I wouldn 't forgive you ? There 's nothing to forgive . Jamie , it 's ... It 's all right . Don 't you see ? I canna be your husband any longer . And I will not be less to you . You did what was necessary to survive . That 's all . No . No , he broke me . He broke me , Claire . He knew it . We both did . You belong to no one else but me . And I belong to you . And nothing will ever change that . Those are just weak words , Claire . I lie here , feeling I will die without your touch , but when you do touch me , I want to vomit with shame . No . You 're my husband , James Fraser . How dare you give up on me now ! You swore to me , you promised me the protection of your body if need be . Well , Randall had your body , but I 'll be damned if he has your soul as well . You 're mine . And we are meant to be together . It 's the only explanation I have for all this . It 's the only way I can wrap my mind around what 's happened all these past months . It 's all been for you and me . But if you take away the one last thing that makes sense to me , then I will die . With you , right here , now . How can you have me like this ? I will have you any way I can . Always . - The laudanum , please . - No . I want to be awake when you cut him out of me . Get on with it . I 'll miss you , mistress . We shall never find another healer the likes of you . Thank you , Willie . You 're a true friend . I doubt everyone is as sad as you are to see us go . It 's nothing personal , mistress , but keeping you and Jamie out of harm 's way proves to be a full-time occupation . That 's very true . Time to go . Mistress Claire ? May I kiss you farewell ? No , you may not . That is far too final . You may kiss me au revoir . Hey , hey . I 'm so sorry . Seriously ? Apologies , mistress , I lost my head . Goodbye to you , Claire . God bless . Very gallant . See , that 's how you take your leave of a lady . All right . Piss off , the lot of you . If ye happen to run into the rightful King across the water , you tell him Angus Mohr sends his best , eh ? King James is in Italy , ye fool , not France . I meant if he ... I meant if he goes to Italy . Yer arse , ye did . I thought I 'd be the one to be puking my guts out over the side and here ye are , as green as rotten fish . Please . Fish is the last thing I want to think about right now . Should I get a bucket ? Glad to see you 're regaining your sense of humor . I 'm trying . It 'll be all right , won 't it ? I mean , we 'll be all right ? I 'll see to it . We 're headed into an unknown future and I ... Aye . I know what you mean . What are we to do in France ? It won 't be forever , Claire . Someday , we 'll return to Scotland . That I promise ye . But you know what 's going to happen in Scotland . The Rising . Culloden . The end of the Highland culture . What can we do but play our part ? What if we could stop it from happening ? The Rising , Culloden , what if we could stop all of it ? Change the future ? The two of us ? That 's madness , is it not ? We have to try . The Rising starts with Prince Charles . And right now , the Bonnie Prince is in France . I believe we can do anything we want , just as long as we 're together . It 'll take some thought . There 's something else . Ye mean besides changing the future ? I 'm not sure I 'm ready to hear it . I 've been wondering how to tell you this . Murtagh assures me that once we 're underway you 'll be too seasick to have a conversation . I 'm pregnant . But , you said you were unable to ... Apparently , I was wrong . Are you happy ? I never thought I 'd be able to say such a thing again , but yes . Yes ! I 'm verra happy indeed , Sassenach !

But this is wicked ! Why am I a merry man ? Huh ? Actually , you 're a minstrel - Great ! I 'm a busker . Are you kidding me ? Jenny , back when people lived in castles minstrels were like rock stars . They made the most kick ass music in all the land ! So instead of a weapon I get a friggin ' pan flute ? That 's an ocarina and I think we 'd all appreciate it if you could try not to be so ignorant towards medieval history . There were no cat people in the middle ages . Or purple she-males . I beg to differ . But if it makes you feel any better , I got stuck with this shitty level one wooden sword .

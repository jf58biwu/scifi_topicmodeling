 ANNOUNCER : Previously on Fringe : WOMAN : An unstable wormhole was quarantined by Fringe Division . Citizens encased in quarantine amber have been ruled legally dead . This is gonna sound nuts . When she had her breakdown , she kept on about how they were trying to make her believe she was somebody else . What if she 's telling the truth ? What if it 's not the real her ? - That is nuts . - You 're right . All right . - How does she seem ? COL . BROYLES : Like Olivia Dunham . For all intents and purposes , she is Agent Dunham . - You 're not from this world , Olivia . - You 're not real . Real is just a matter of perception . And I 'm the part of you that you have to hold on to . You can 't forget who you are , Olivia . ALT BRANDON : You 've been back with Fringe Division for a week now ? Uh , for eight days . Any headaches or lingering symptoms ? Mood swings ? Insomnia ? No . Although I do feel like I keep getting asked the same question over and over . Is that a lingering symptom ? You 're recovering from a severe mental break . I have to ask these questions . Yeah , I know . Please accept my apologies for the poking and prodding , Agent Dunham . - Uh , Mr. Secretary . - You look well . I am . Good as new . - Did you get the dossier I sent over ? - Yes , sir . So you really believe that the other Olivia Dunham ... - ... can cross between universes ? - It would appear so . We 've developed means of our own , but each of them has dangerous side effects . Though it seems their Olivia can travel between worlds safely which is the real reason you 're here today . We believe you may be able to do the same . How would I be able to do that ? I don 't know . Yet . But with your permission , we 'd like to put you through a series of experiments to see if we 're right . I 'm sure you understand what this would mean to our cause . We 'd be able to defend ourselves against the Other Side . But I know you 've been through a lot , Olivia . So if you 're not up to it , you should just say so . You can take as many pills as you want . I 'm not going anywhere . You 're not here . Look , I understand why you agreed to take the tests . You want things to go back to normal to be the Olivia that you think you should be but unfortunately , that 's not gonna happen . Because you 're not their Olivia . And you can keep on telling yourself that you 're fine , but you 're not fine . You 're not sleeping , and I 'm not a lingering symptom . You can 't ignore me . ROSE : All right , easy . - You got it ? WILNER : Yeah . ROSE : Careful . I said careful ! There we go . Okay , ready ? Up . I got it , I got it . - He 's not breathing . - He 's dead . No , he 's not dead . Give me the syringe . Give me the syringe ! Come on , buddy . Come on , come on , come on . ( BEEPS ) WILNER : Nothing . ROSE : Come on ! Come on . ( ALARM BUZZING ) ALARM VOICE : Warning , quarantine area breached . The cops are gonna be here any minute . - We gotta move . - Breathe ! Come on , breathe ! Come on ! ( ENCASED MAN COUGHING ) ROSE : Okay . Okay . You 're okay , you 're okay . Cut him out . Cut him out . You okay ? ALARM VOICE : Quarantine area breached . - Give me a minute . We 'll cut you out . ALARM VOICE : Warning . ROSE : Just breathe . ALARM VOICE : Warning , quarantine area breached . Warning . - Wilner ? Wilner . WILNER : Oh , God . Here . Come on , come on , pull . Just pull . Come on . - Pull . Come on ! WILNER : Pull ! ROSE : Come on , come on , come on . Pull it ! Help me . Please . ROSE : Look , I 'm sorry . He 's my brother . No , please ! Don 't leave me ! Fringe s3e05 Amber 31422 LINCOLN : Homemade laser knife . It 's clean . There 's no fingerprints . LINCOLN : Pretty sophisticated tech for looters . CHARLIE : Gotta hand it to them . No one 's ever removed anything from the quarantine zone , yet they keep trying . A lot of purses and wallets in there . Like Cary Grant said the stuff that dreams are made of . Huh . You got something ? I don 't know yet . I 'll be right back . OLIVIA : Hey . - Well , look who 's here . - Yeah . Traffic . - Third time this week . You gotta stop taking the Nixon Parkway . - You okay ? You seem a little run down . - Oh , yeah . Frank 's on assignment . I never sleep very well when he 's away . So you gonna bring me up to speed ? MAN ( ON MONITOR ) : In 1989 , these tears in the fabric of our universe began to increase in frequency . Some expanded into micro black holes with devastating consequences . To contain these events , scientists designed a quarantine protocol using a chemical substance , Amber ... - Fast-forward it . - What are you looking for ? I watched this a couple weeks ago . I just remember something a little differently . Right there . Freeze it . Thanks . Four years ago , this station was sealed . Now it looks like we have a new addition . Meet our thief . LINCOLN : Must 've gotten caught in the reseal . Mark Wilner . Couple counts of burglary . You know , breaking into amber seems awfully ambitious for a small-time crook . Something tells me he wasn 't after purses . So this is where the powerful hide out . WALTER : Just those that need to do some thinking before they head home . Thank you for meeting me . I understand you 're working on a case . A man removed from amber . Franklin Street Station . We 're trying to determine why someone would go to all that trouble to steal him . When I first developed the amber the universe was degrading at an alarming rate . People were becoming afraid to leave their homes . I remember the first time we instigated the protocol . It was October 17th , 1989 . I remember I woke particularly happy that day . And then there was the breach at Harvard Yard . If we hadn 't contained it , half of Boston would 've been swallowed up . Sixty-three civilians were trapped in amber that day . And all the hundreds since . - It sickens me . - Sir . It 's a tragic , but small price to pay for the greater good . People understand that . Perhaps . But if they were to find out that the amber victims could be removed and resuscitated , I 'm afraid the outcry would be akin to revolt . - Quarantine victims are alive ? - Theoretically . But to remove them would weaken the structural integrity of the amber . We 'll recover him before anyone finds out , sir . Oh , and another thing . Olivia Dunham has agreed to submit to the tests developed by Science Division . As I 've said , these tests are stressful . - If she becomes unstable in any way ... - If I see any unusual behavior I 'll let you know . Nature doesn 't recognize good and evil , Phillip . Nature only recognizes balance and imbalance . I intend to restore balance to our world . Whatever it takes . Really ? You never did that before ? - Make my own Popsicles ? - Yeah . OLIVIA : My mom used to have these plastic molds and you 'd pour fruit juice into them and then stick them in the freezer . My mom made me get her cigarettes . LINCOLN OLIVIA : Aw . So who 's the Popsicle ? COL . BROYLES : Joshua Rose . I worked his case with Fringe Division four years ago . He 's a bank robber . Why would Fringe Division be appointed to investigate a robber ? Rose used some device that allowed him to access vaults without setting off the alarms . What it also did was cause molecular degradation . Man-made breaches . We studied that at the academy . You had to quarantine half a dozen areas . One for every job Rose pulled . The bank above Franklin Station was Rose 's last job . He got caught in the quarantine . Now , it 's possible that he was taken out in order to be revived . Revived ? COL . BROYLES : What I 'm about to tell you is classified . The people entombed in amber are in a state of suspended animation . Sir , if people knew that their loved ones were still alive in there ... I understand . Which is why we need to recover Rose whatever state he 's in , as soon as possible . He had an apartment that was sealed after he was ambered . Start there . ( MUFFLED ) Don 't try to talk . Shh , shh , shh , shh . Just rest . You 'll be fine . He just needs time to recover , Danielle . CHARLIE : My first partner got caught in an amber quarantine in Boston . His little girl just turned 6 last week . If I get ambered , just leave me in there . PETER : Does that feel familiar ? Two people who look exactly alike . LINCOLN : You find anything ? What do we know about Rose 's family ? Never married , no kids , parents are dead . He has a brother , Matthew , an accountant . Broyles said he was very cooperative in their investigation . Okay . Well , maybe we should talk to him again . CHARLIE : Hey , guys ! Jackpot . - Anybody recognize any of this stuff ? - Some of it . Lon lasers , pneumo drills , some kind of gas . Looks like he was trying to build some kind of negative-matter ring . Okay , Mr. Wizard , some of us don 't have a fancy degree . It creates high-frequency vibrations . Which could weaken the atomic structure of the banks ' walls and would explain how Rose was able to get inside . - He walked through walls ? LINCOLN : It 's possible . Okay , now I know you pulled that out of your ass . Shh . Listen . ( FAINT HISSING ) Go . Now ! - This might sting a bit . - Okay . Dinner is on me tonight , Liv . Evvia , Pimlico , whatever you want . Big spender . What 's the occasion ? Olivia saved our lives . She heard the bomb before it went off . We had enough time to get out . - Good work , agent . - Thank you , sir . - Did you ID the symbol on those tanks ? - Ferrocene . It 's a compound used in negative-matter rings . - Oh ! What 'd I say ? - Gloating isn 't attractive . ( MUMBLES MOCKINGLY ) Hold still , Agent Francis . ( CHARLIE GRUNTS ) That looks pretty bad . Why don 't you take this off ? I 'll get the doctor . OLIVIA : Okay . LINCOLN : Liv ? ( OLIVIA CLEARS THROAT ) Soon as we 're done , we 're gonna go talk to Joshua Rose 's brother . Okay . You got it ? Be right back . All right ? I 'll be right back . - Matthew Rose ? ROSE : Yeah , what can I do for you ? LINCOLN : Agent Lee , Fringe Division . - This is Agent Dunham . ROSE : What 's going on ? What we 're about to ask you is classified . It 's about your brother , Joshua . Any idea about his whereabouts ? You know , four years ago you people told me that he was trapped in amber . You telling me you were wrong ? We can 't go into detail . But if we were wrong , would he contact you ? My ... My brother ripped families apart , okay ? Mothers and husbands trapped in amber because of the crimes he committed . He 'd know better than to contact me . You have any idea what it was like when he started showing up on the news ? Every time I went to the market , the movies , take my kids to Little League ... - ... people would look at me and see him . - That must have been very difficult . Just because we look alike , it doesn 't mean we have anything in common . We appreciate your time , Mr. Rose . If you hear anything ... Yeah . And all this time I thought my brother was a pain in the ass . ( CELL PHONE BEEPING ) OLIVIA : Oh . Gotta go to the DOD . They 're ready for me . Are you sure you 're up for this ? I mean , you just started back to work . Yeah . I can handle it . But thank you , Mom . ( GRUNTING ) Where 's Danielle ? She , uh ... She 's at the store . She 's gonna be back in a minute . Let me see . I don 't know how to say this , but you , uh ... You came to the bank to try and stop me , but you were too late . I mean , I didn 't know . I couldn 't know you were coming . You were trying to stop me from robbing a bank . I ended up stealing your life . But you 're free now . It took me longer than I thought , but I never gave up . ( DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES ) How are our boys ? They 're so big , you 're not gonna believe it . They 're giants . ( SOBBING ) Oh , Matthew . It 's okay , it 's okay . WALTER : Genetically , you are exact replicates . You and the other Olivia . Which means , theoretically , you both should be capable of the same thing . In the isolation tank you 'll be freed from sensory distractions and so the part of your brain which enables you to travel between universes should be more accessible . And we will help the process along by giving you a number of psychotropic drugs . There 's a speaker in the tank , so you 'll be able to hear us . And we 'll be monitoring you closely . - Okay . - You ready ? Just like riding the roller coaster at Coney Island , right ? ( CHUCKLES ) Close it . Olivia , can you hear me ? We 'll start the drugs now . Now we wait . It 's not working . Increase the doses . Five thousand milligrams Neurontin , 2000 Elavil . Sir , are you really ... ? Only those who risk going too far find out how far they can go . Do it . ( ALARM BEEPING ) Oh , hell . Uh , heart rate is 183 , blood pressure is falling . MOTHER : Cameron . I told you not to touch anything . ( GASPING AND PANTING ) I went somewhere . To a gift shop . There was a boy . It worked . She crossed over . PETER : It makes sense now , doesn 't it ? Why they needed you to take their tests voluntarily . Why they needed you to believe that you were their Olivia . They know you can cross over . You 've done it before . That 's how you ended up here in the first place . ( KNOCK ON DOOR ) - Mom , hey . - Hi . - Come in . - It 's Tuesday . Yeah , yeah . Oh . Lunch . I 'm sorry , it just slipped my mind . It 's just been really hectic and ... Yeah . You know , Frank does most of the real cleaning around here . - He 's still away ? - He 's still in North Texas trying to put a stop to that smallpox outbreak . Olive , is everything okay ? ( GROANS ) Mom , I 'm just tired , and I keep seeing ... PETER : I knew a pair of twins in high school . Nina and Gina . One of them was always so much brighter than the other but they both managed to get straight A 's . I 'll give you one guess how they did that . MARILYN : Olivia . - Yeah ? I asked you , when is he coming back in town ? Mom , I 've gotta go . I 'm sorry . Do you mind if you let yourself out ? Sir . Uh , they switched . - Who ? - The twins . When we spoke to Matthew Rose today , when he talked about Joshua 's crimes he wasn 't , uh , angry or upset . He was ashamed . He wasn 't embarrassed . It was more like he was guilty . You think Joshua Rose was pretending to be his brother ? I think the man we spoke to today committed those crimes . I think that they switched on us . What is this about ? ( DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES ) Identical twins have the same DNA , but fingerprints and retinas are unique . COL . BROYLES : He is who he says he is . This is Matthew Rose . Yeah , well , something 's not right . Dunham , it was just a hunch . - They switched again . - Liv ... - I 'll prove it to you . - Dunham . You switched with your brother . - What are you talking about ? - You know what I 'm talking about . - Olivia . - Hang on . Okay , we went to your house yesterday . - What did we talk about ? - What ? At your house . What did we talk about ? Your partner did most of the talking . I told you how hard it was for me and my family when Joshua was robbing banks . He told him . What we look like , what we talked about . They 're in it together . They 're messing with us . They switched . Dunham . Outside . He 's lying , and you can 't prove that I 'm wrong . - We can 't prove you 're right either . - Liv ... They 're twins . Are you telling me that it 's not possible ... - ... that they took each other 's place ? - Look , even if you 're right we can 't hold him on a hunch . AIDE : Colonel , you got a visitor upstairs . Colonel Broyles , I 'm not sure you remember me . Of course , Mrs. Dunham . ( MARILYN CHUCKLES ) What can I do for you ? Olivia would be furious with me but I think she went back to work too soon . She just hasn 't been herself and I 'm worried that there 's something wrong . Damn it . Hey . You okay ? I mean , that depends . Do you believe me ? Break-in at Langdon Chemical two weeks ago . Guess what they stole . - Three tanks of ferrocene . - Who uses ferrocene again ? So Joshua Rose is planning another heist . Uh , ahem , sir . Lee , go check it out . Take Francis . Oh . Don 't do this . Don 't take me off the case . I think you 've been pushed too hard . Go . Sir , I 'm not crazy . I know I 'm right about this . - Dunham . - If I could just follow it through ... Dunham , go home . ( PHONE RINGING ) JOSHUA ( ON PHONE ) : How 'd it go ? MATTHEW : They know . One of the agents knows . She knows it was you at the house , that we switched . - But they let you go ? - Yeah . Matty , are you being followed ? - I don 't see anyone . - You wouldn 't see anybody . What are we gonna do ? Just , um ... Run some errands . Just don 't come home yet . I need a couple hours . - I 'll take care of this . - How ? Just do what I said . It wasn 't supposed to be like this . They weren 't supposed to be this close . I 'm doing my best here . You know that . Do you know what it was like for him ? In the amber . Did he tell you ? Well , he told me . He was aware of every moment . His mind was stuck in the last thought he had before he was trapped . This horrible feeling of fear and loss wondering about his family , how we would get along . Can you imagine that ? I have a plan . What , you gonna rob a bank ? One last score to get lost and stay lost , Joshua ? If you really cared about him , you 'd turn yourself in because that is the only way out of this . BOY : Oh , nice goal . Whoo ! Agent Farnsworth , would you mind taking a look at something for me ? If Joshua Rose was about to hit another bank where would it be ? Given his profile and MO . I ran that scenario for Agent Lee . I understand . But would you mind taking another look for me ? There are 37 likely targets based on that criteria . What assumptions did you make ? Assuming Joshua Rose was taken out of the amber necessary parameters would include a subterranean vault a minimum of $ 50,000 , proper getaway routes ... Wait . Sorry , assuming that Joshua was removed from the amber ? We know that he was taken out . We know someone was taken from the amber . Joshua 's a twin . There 's a 50-percent chance his brother was in amber ... - ... and that Joshua broke him out . - And Joshua is a brilliant criminal with expertise in breaking into impenetrable areas . Matthew is an accountant . Yes . Okay , so if Matthew was in the amber , then Joshua 's MO may have changed . I don 't follow your logic . Okay , I think I spoke to Joshua yesterday . He was clearly ashamed . If he 's spent the past four years living with the guilt of trapping his brother in amber then he 's not gonna wanna hurt people again . Less human traffic , remote area . Reduced collateral damage . That would narrow the list of likely targets down to three . Three banks . ( STUN GUN BUZZES ) ( ALARM BEEPING ) Anomalous energy signature detected . Class-two breach . - Who has a location ? - Parameters match events from 2006 . Seventy-nine percent probability it was caused by Joshua Rose . I need a location . - Riverdale Mutual . The Bronx . - Let 's go , people . She was right . Who ? Agent Dunham . I want science and risk reports now ! CHARLIE : It 's Olivia 's car . Chief , molecular degradation is increasing . - Looking at a 200-meter quarantine . - Set a perimeter . Best way in is the main entrance . I want three canisters in the main lobby . A three-point spread with dispersion tubes to the basement and the second floor . We got a busted lock on the subway gate . - She could be there . - She could be anywhere . - The quarantine is in place . - Sir , if she 's in there ... It 's a class-two breach . We have to seal it . Five minutes . Give us five minutes . You 've got three . ALARM VOICE : Warning . Quarantine protocol imminent . Warning . Protocol initiation imminent . What are you doing here ? I found the blueprints . I realized what you were up to , and I can 't let you do this again . - Warning . Quarantine protocol ... LINCOLN : Olivia ! CHARLIE : Dunham ! LINCOLN : Liv ! - All right , we gotta move . OLIVIA : Okay , wait . - Joshua Rose is in there . - We gotta move . LINCOLN : We gotta go . Come on . OLIVIA : Rose is in there . LINCOLN : Let 's go ! You gotta leave . There 's no time . You gotta go now . Not without you . We don 't need the money . Where are your tools ? Unless they think they have me , they 'll never stop . There 's no other way . If I turn myself in , they 'll figure it out . They 'll know I wasn 't the one in the amber . They 'll take you . You 're the only person alive that 's survived the quarantine . They 'll experiment on you for the rest of your life . You know that . Matty . Matt , you gotta go . I 'm not taking your life twice . ( ALARM RINGING ) Josh . No . Matt . Let me do this one good thing . Quarantine protocol complete . One casualty . Joshua Rose . - Let 's clean up and go home . OFFICER : Officers will reroute pedestrians . COL . BROYLES : Dunham , you hang back . OFFICER : They will take you to the intersection where you can continue . Are you aware of how many protocols you broke ? OFFICER : This area is quarantined . You have no access at this time . No access . Good work . Thank you , colonel . OFFICER : We appreciate your cooperation . This area is now under quarantine . LINCOLN : Okay . OFFICER : All civilians must now evacuate the area . This area is now under quarantine . ( KNOCK ON DOOR ) OLIVIA : Hello . We found your brother and I 'm sorry to say he was caught in a quarantine protocol last night . Where ? Riverdale Mutual , in the Bronx . He was attempting to break in . Well , thank you for telling me , agent . I 'm sorry . True or false ? I take this to my lab , get them to run this skin sample they 'd tell me this was from a man who spent the past four years in amber . Hey , Dad , mom needs you to stick the steaks on the grill . Okay , buddy . Have a good day . And you can consider this investigation closed . You know why you let him go , don 't you ? Because you can understand what he 's going through . Trapped in that amber ... It 's just like you 're trapped over here . The only difference is , nobody 's going to save you . Only you can save yourself . You listened to me about the case . You won 't listen to me about this . Why do you refuse to believe who you are ? Why do you deny the truth about yourself ? You can 't prove anything that you 're saying . But I know things . You 're in my head . Exactly . Which means you know things too . Things about the Other Side . Things you couldn 't possibly know unless you 'd been there . Unless you were from there . Like what ? On the Other Side , the Twin Towers have fallen . On the Other Side , your sister is alive . She lives in Chicago . Her husband took a job there . They live at 1934 ... - You 're lying . Rachel hates Chicago . - On the Other Side , your niece Ella is alive . She was born , and it 's her birthday today . She turned 7 . There 's no way to prove it . Yes , there is . Brandon . I wanna go back in the tank . You 're not scheduled for another test until tomorrow . Anything new ? No . - But something interesting . - Hmm ? About 20 minutes ago , her brain chemistry spiked . It seems there 's some dormant chemical in her brain . WALTER : Some sort of synthetic compound . From the way it 's bound to her neurons , I 'd say it 's been there since she was a child . ( ALARM BEEPING ) ELLA ( ON PHONE ) : Hello ? - Hi . ELLA : Aunt Liv . I knew you wouldn 't forget my birthday . Aunt Liv ? ( PANTING ) What happened ? It didn 't work . Nothing happened . All I saw was black .

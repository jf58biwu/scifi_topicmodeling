 Ohh ! Man . Oww ! Hey , bud . Where you been ? Just got back from the Dentibot . I needed a filling . Bet you chickened , though , right ? Soon as that robo-drill started screeching , I bet you were gone . Yeah . How d 'you know that ? You 're still wearing a bib . Who needs a dental bot anyway , man ? Half a bottle of GELF hooch , can 't feel a thing now . Anywhere . Starting to worry , actually . If it was me , I 'd get my teeth fixed , Gummy . Otherwise in a couple of years , you 'll be flossing with towrope . Eeh , eeh , eeh . Can you hear that ? Hear what ? That ! Can 't you hear it ? It 's driving me crazy . All over the ship , wherever I go , there 's this really annoying whiny sound . Yeah , it 's you . Stop talking , it goes . Still there . You 're still talking ! Lister . This ship is falling apart . I need some help . Don 't look at me , Rimmer . I am busy today . Busy ? And what are you doing today that makes you so " busy " ? I 'm getting drunk . That 's your day ? Not just any old drunk . I 'm talking traffic-cone-hugging , pavement-licking kershnickered . That 's my day . Cheers . Er ... what 's this ? Ah , I 'm making a Father 's Day card . YOU 'RE making a Father 's Day card ? You ? Who to ? Well , let 's round up the suspects , shall we , Sherlock ? First up , there 's me dad . But YOU 'RE your dad . You went back in time and left your baby self under a pool table in a cardboard box . You 're your own dad . So therefore I shouldn 't get any Father 's Day cards ? It 's not my fault that due to some time-travelly paradoxy sci-fi smeg I happen to be my own dad . I do this every year . I write myself a " Thanks for being such an amazing dad " card , then I drink myself into oblivion so I forget what I 've written , and then 12 months later , on Father 's Day , which , by the way , happens to be today , Kryten delivers a Father 's Day card and I haven 't got a clue what it says . How cool is that ? ! Morning , sirs ! Oh , he hasn 't ! Oh , I think he has , sir . He never forgets his old dad . I don 't know how he finds the time , what with all the things he 's up to as well . Aww . Look at that ! Dreads ! Brilliant ! I mean , how funny is that ? Oh ! What a brilliant card . Made it himself , you know . Oh , look , a bit of poppadom ! Poppadom ! Aww . Aww . Aww ! So thoughtful . Aww . Wait a minute . How can you even stand your dad ? He abandoned you in a pub in a cardboard box . The only thing he 's ever given you your whole life is a rattle and a few air holes . What kind of a dad is that ? That 's true , yeah . That 's right . That 's ... that 's not right , that , is it ? There it is again , that whiny sound . You 're talking again ! Number 32-12 required , and a replacement valve-housing gasket for 17 . Noted , sir . I thought the new computer was supposed to be helping with all this . It 's not uploaded yet , sir . Later today . Hey , Kryten , how 's it going ? Great night last night . You can say that again , 16 ! We had quite a night of it last night , sir . Me and a bunch of the dispensing machines got together and played Chinese Whispers . We had so much fun . Now , the sentence started as , " I slit the sheet , the sheet I slit , on the slit sheet , I ... " Kryten . Yes , sir ? Shut up . Yes , sir . I 'm not remotely interested in some stupid parlour game you were playing with a talking condom machine and two Lil-Let dispensers . Yes , sir . Sorry , sir . Thank you , sir . While we 're at it , Chinese Whispers - isn 't that racist ? Basically , what you 're saying is that Chinese people can 't convey a simple piece of information to one another . Now , if that 's the case , how come they invented acupuncture , gunpowder ... laundry , and those funny little hats ? Chinese Whispers - it 's offensive , racist and wrong . Ask around , I think you 'll find I 'm right . So , how can I help ? I need some advice . I want to be a better father to my son . What kind of person is your son ? Ooh , tough question . If I had to sum him up in one word , it would be ... ohh ... awesome ? And he 's smart . I mean , OK , not book-smart , but that 's only cos he hasn 't read any books . If he had , then who knows ? ! And he 's a killer guitarist . You know , when he 's had a few , he is up there with Hendrix . So what 's the problem ? He 's in a rut . He 's not going anywhere . No job , no girlfriend , and to be honest , I know I shouldn 't , but I kind of blame myself . So he 's a total bum . Total bum ? ! I don 't think so . A bum , maybe , but TOTAL bum ? No way . Ah ! That 's weird . I don 't seem to have your son on file . Ah , well , there 's a reason for that . He should register ! He 's missing out on a whole raft of privileges . Is he ? Free Christmas champagne ! His own TV and game package ! It 'll only take five minutes . Quick medical , so we can set up his bios for stasis , and he 's done . What 's his name ? Dave . Same as you ! I 'll open a file for him right now . Done . OK , here 's what I think . Tough love . Tough love . Set him goals . He doesn 't achieve those goals , kick his butt . Kick it hard ! Tough love . Tough love . Tough love . That 's a great question , Kryten . Is Chinese Whispers racist ? Leave it with me . I 'll do some research . Hi , Garby . So you 're a cat of the world - what do you think ? Eh , I dunno , 16 . But you got me intrigued . Let me ask around . Thank goodness for that derelict , sir . I am just so excited at the prospect of having a new computer ! We so miss Holly . It 's true - we just don 't get the same quality of cock-up these days , do we ? OK , sir . The computer is ready to launch . Here we go , the " pref " menus . Ah . Male or female ? Female . Not really bothered . Doesn 't really matter . Female . Age - 25 , 50 , or 75 ? Whatever . Let 's not get held back by this , Kryten . 25 . Blonde or brunette ? Honestly don 't care . It doesn 't matter . Not important . Blonde . Breast size . I can 't honestly believe they actually still ask that question these days . It 's absolutely ludicrous , it really is . I totally agree with you , sir . I 'll choose the first one . 30A . Hang on ! What 's the hurry , Kryten ? Everyone knows you don 't just pick the first thing that comes into your head . What 's that one down there at the bottom ? That 's ... a 36D , sir . Fine . Go with that one . Whatever . 36D it is . I 've already highlighted 30A , sir . Kryten , don 't argue . 36D it is . But sir ! Kryten , it 's not important . I don 't know why you 're making such a fuss about this . 36D . Select it . Moving on . But I 'm not making a fuss , sir . I 'm just ... OK , I 'm pulling rank . I order you to select 36D as the breast size for the new computer . And that 's an order . Selected , sir . Ah , now ... Personality . Whatever . Oh . Accent ? Whatever . Frame size . Your call . Let 's launch . Who cares ? Close-up chosen . Ah , there we go . Oh , I really like that frame size , don 't you , sir ? Hey-hey ! Ooh ! Hello . My name 's Pree . It will take a few moments for my database to initialise . Oww ! Nice pixels ! Hey , buds , what 's happening ? We 're just launching the new computer , sir . Here we go . Greetings , gentlemen . My name is Pree , and I will be your new ship computer . I have many functions , including predictive behaviour technology . Predictive what ? ! Like predictive text on a cell phone , predictive behaviour technology anticipates your actions based on past behaviour and performs the rest of the action for you . How 's she able to do that ? ! Well , best guess , she builds behavioural algorithms from the ship 's security footage , so she 's able to guess how we 're most likely to behave in any given situation . Exactly right , Kryten . What about maintenance ? Can you repair the ship 's engineering faults ? I already anticipated you 'd ask me that question , Arnold , and I 've repaired all the faults on B Deck already . There is now a 98 % probability you will discuss my potential for changing your lives and reach the conclusion that you 're looking forward to seeing me in action . You now no longer need to have this conversation and can do something else . So now we don 't have that conversation and move straight on to the next conversation ? Your next conversation is a conversation about not having the previous conversation , saying you were looking forward to the previous conversation , and now feel a bit lost , not having had that conversation . You conclude you will probably get used to hearing the results of your conversations and no longer having the conversations yourselves . Hey ! New computer ! Predictive . Knows what you 're likely to say and do in any given situation . Heh-hey , that could come in handy ! Got a job for you . I know . Kebab pillow . I must have got trashed last night . Throbbo . What 's this ? Don 't remember making this . Hi , son . It 's your dad here . - Dad ! - Here 's the plan . I 'm going to give you some advice . Kind of a " do as I say , not as I do " kind of style . Then I 'm going to get totally trashed so I forget what I 've said , and then when you watch this , you 'll feel like you 've got a totally normal , ordinary , regular dad , yeah ? I don 't remember making this . Rimmer 's right . I 've never been a proper dad to you . Never watched you play zero-gee , never encouraged you , gave you advice , kicked your big fat butt when it needed kicking . Maybe that 's why you 've ended up like this . Like what ? You 're a big , big disappointment to me , David , you really are . - What ? - No ambition . Sitting about . Wasting your life away . And you 're not looking after yourself . And you drink too much . It 's getting worse . I 'm doing OK . " I 'm doing OK , " you 're probably saying . " I 'm doing OK . " But you 're not . I mean , you could have been so much more , and-and you know it . Who are you to tell me what to do ? What have you ever done with your life ? You 've gotta get yourself an education . At least get good at SOMETHING , and then ... and then build a home , a proper home , and then go and find Krissy . And how do I do all of that ? Er ... Step one . Enrol in the Jupiter Mining Corporation engineering programme . Er , step two , get that filling fixed . And then play the next message . So ! You had to enrol in the Jupiter engineering mining programme and get that filling fixed . How did it go , eh ? D 'you make your old man proud ? You didn 't do it , did you , David ? No ! You just skipped ahead to the next message - to see what I 'd say , didn 't you ? - Yes , Dad . I knew you 'd do that . It was a test . - Sorry , Dad . - Now , get your filling fixed , no messing , then play message three , yeah ? What , d 'you think I 'm stupid ? Is that what do you think ? D 'you think I 'm stupid , eh ? Get the filling fixed , then play the next message ! - What the smeg ? - And don 't swear . How the smeg d 'you know I was going to swear ? Let me make one thing crystal clear , young man . I will not be having any of your nonsense . While you 're living under my roof , on my spaceship , you abide by my rules . And if you don 't like it , well , you know what you can do . Now , if you skip ahead one more time , I 'm going to flush that guitar of yours out of an airlock . Now , get the filling done NOW . Thought I 'd finally do what you wanted , did you ? Well , you got that wrong . Message four . Good . We 're finally making some progress . Wrong ! Finally learned a little bit of respect . - Wro-ong ! - By the way , see your guitar ? Go on . Go over there . Give us a song . What 's he up to ? Have a look out of that porthole there . See that tiny speck half a light year away ? That 's your Gibson Les Paul , that is . - No ! - Tough love . D 'you want some more ? Now , enrol in the mech engineering programme and get the filling done now ! Or you 'll get some more Daddy Discipline . I really loved that guitar ! You don 't understand me ! I hate you ! Bastard ! Evening , Pree . Glad you had such a good day , Arnold . So sorry this evening 's going to be such a nightmare . Ah , but it 's not . I 'm going to put my feet up and watch TV . Put on Victory South for me , will you ? A fascinating drama series about the American Civil War where the South win . Loved series one , really looking forward to series two . I deleted all 24 episodes earlier this morning , Arnold . What ? ! I watched them all yesterday , and you didn 't enjoy them . But I haven 't seen them . But if you had , you wouldn 't have enjoyed them . But series one was brilliant ! Why didn 't I enjoy them ? All your favourite characters were killed off , including the busty blonde heroine with no personality . Aww , I loved her . What am I supposed to do now ? I thought you could use that time more fruitfully , perhaps finally reading War And Peace . I want to unwind , relax . Not read a book that 's longer than Rapunzel 's pubic hair . Sir , come quickly ! B Deck is in total disarray ! B Deck , the floor Pree repaired ? Pree , what 's happened ? I thought you were going to repair all this ! I did . And thanks to my predictive capabilities , I was able to carry out the repairs in the exact manner you would have instructed . It 's one botch-up after another , with no regard to safety procedures or good workmanship ! Exactly . How can you be a top computer if you do something like this ? I didn 't , Arnold , YOU did . I merely duplicated what you would have done . I don 't understand ! I 'm programmed to align myself with the ship 's senior officer so computer and crew can perform as one . What the senior officer would do , I do for them . You 're saying because I would have cocked all this up , you cocked it all up for me ? Precisely . Well , this is really embarrassing . What do I do now ? You now have a conversation with Kryten where you blame him for everything and then stride off indignantly . There is now no need to have this conversation and you go straight to your exit . Is this the line for the Dentibot ? Get in the queue , bud . What 's up ? Oh , filling . Finally decided to get it done . Got a question for you . Been driving everyone nuts . If anyone knows , you 'll know . Here 's the question . Are Chinese whiskers racist ? Are Chinese whiskers racist ? Mmm . D 'you mean those wispy little Mandarin beards like Fu Manchu ? Exactly . Dunno . D 'you know who might know ? That Asian fast-food machine on B Deck . Taiwan Tony ? Taiwan Tony . Bet he 'll know . Why would he know ? ! Cos Taiwan Tony 's from Taiwan , and Taiwan 's a bit ... Chinesey . Taiwan 's a bit Chinesey ? Of course it is ! I 'll ask him . Hang on , what are YOU doing here ? Heard we 're nearly out of anaesthetic . Thought I 'd grab the last tank . We 've only got one tank of anaesthetic ? One tank , and I 'm going to grab it ! But you don 't need it , right ? Don 't need it now . But one day I will ! I 'm always collecting things I don 't need for when I need ' em . You got to think ahead ! But I need that anaesthetic now . See ? You didn 't think ahead ! This is what I 'm saying . You got to think ahead . Look , I 've got a cavity a stretch limo could do a three-point turn in . I need that anaesthetic . How about we share ? Hey , bud , never ask a Cat to share . As a smash in the face often offends ! Hey , that 's me ! Wish me luck . You realise we are out of anaesthetic . It 's only pain , right ? I can handle it . Proves I 'm alive . I embrace it . And as for the brain-smouldering agony , I 've been told I 'm not squeamish . I can certainly watch those medical programmes where they pull the beating heart out of a human chest and still eat pizza . So , a new filling , without anaesthetic ? I say come on , bring it on . Let the drilling commence . Hey , that 's the second bib we 've lost this week ! Great chow mein . Oh , you like the chow mein ? That good . I make it myself . Got a question for you . Hmm ? Are Chinese whiskers racist ? Ohh . That a very strange question , Mr Cat . Leave with me . I ask people . People who pass , I ask , every time . Thanks . Did you get that filling done ? Yes , sir . I did , sir . All filled up . All done . Don 't you lie to me , David Lister . You chickened out again , didn 't you ? Yes , Dad . Well , this is going to hurt me a lot more than it 's going to hurt you . But you ... you leave me no choice . Ohh ! Hello ? Aspirin . - Hello ? - I 'm afraid the dispensers , Dave , are only programmed to serve registered crew . Oh , new computer , hi ! I am registered crew . Not any longer , former crewman . You resigned from Red Dwarf last night . Resigned ? You what ? Oh , that wasn 't me ! That was me dad ! Who , OK , IS me , but it wasn 't me that resigned , it was him . Look , we 'll start again . I 'm me , and my dad 's me , because I 'm my own dad . Now , to teach me a lesson , he - my dad - resigned . Although he resigned and he is me , I don 't want to resign cos I 'm not him , even though he 's me . It 's clear . Totally clear , former crewman . Don 't say " former crewman " ! Present crewman . Your resignation has just been processed and your free oxygen allowance will terminate today at noon . That 's ... ten minutes ' time ! D 'you know what ? I 'll ... I 'll just re-enlist . The only way to re-enlist is to apply for one of the JMC undergrad programmes . Ha ! Yeah . That was his plan all along . Just one question , former crewman . Are you 21 or under ? Well , my haircut is . Does that count ? I 'm sorry , former crewman . That makes you ineligible for the programme . And since the JMC is no longer obligated to provide you with oxygen , your free supply will end in eight minutes and counting . Ooh ! I really need oxygen , it 's really important to me lifestyle ! You need to leave . I 'm not going anywhere . Where will I go ? I 'm not leaving . You 're leaving . No , I 'm not . I 'm staying here . You just watch me not leave . Dave ! Is that you ? Dave ! My friend , Mr Cat , he has very strange question . So , I ask everyone who pass . See if they know . What 's the question , TT ? Do ... Chinese knickers have braces ? " Do Chinese knickers have braces ? " Well , I suppose some of them do . Maybe for that extra feeling of security if , say , you 're a woman jumping out of a plane in a skirt . That what I thought ! Who wants their pants flying off at 10,000 feet ? It a long way down , and draughty all the way . Leave it with me , TT . I 'll ask around . Oh , you know who might know ? Dispenser 55 , down on G Deck . Don 't waste your time ! He know nothing ! He all pre-package ! All microwave ! No way . Can someone help ? ! Help me ! I 'm being apprehended ! Kryten , help me ! I 'm being chucked out ! Your JMC oxygen subscription will end in 30 seconds . Hang on , I 've gotta get my gloves on ! And counting . I 'm not ready ! I 've gotta get my stuff on ! Expulsion time , ten seconds and counting . Ten . - Nine . Five . Four . - Just give us ten seconds ... ! Aaah ! That wasn 't ten seconds ! Thank you for breathing JMC oxygen , and we hope sometime in the future you 'll decide to breathe our oxygen again . Have a safe onward journey . Goodbye . What the hell is that ? An airlock 's opened , and the ship 's just ejected something ! Oh ! It looks like a little man in a spacesuit ! That 's not a man . That 's Lister . What 's he doing out there ? ! Gentlemen . What 's happened to Lister ? He resigned , Arnold , and as a consequence , our mission goal has now changed . There 's no longer a requirement to return Crewman Lister to Earth , nor is it fiscally prudent to return or crew this ship . Mindful of the Space Pollution Act , JMC policy dictates the ship should dispose of itself by flying straight into the nearest sun . What ? ! What about us ? Never mind us , what about me ? No need for alarm , Arnold , you can come too . In fact , I 'm instructed to offer you a new position as supervising officer on our voyage into the heart of the solar core . Operation Sizzle . Or if you prefer , Arnold , your hologrammic unit can be shut down now . So , I have a choice . Get turned off now , have a non-existence for the rest of eternity , or live a little longer and then get cooked to death ? It 's a real head-scratcher , sir , no question . So how long have we got before we reach the point of no return , the melting point ? You mean the point where suncream and floppy hats are no defence because our noses have started melting onto our shoes , which are now floating down the corridor in a river made up of our own leg gravy ? Well , we 'll go as fast as we can , Supervising Officer , as I know you 're keen to complete the mission . How long , you mad goth bastard ? Well , I can have the ship fly beyond its safety limits , disengage the carbon carbon-reinforced heat shields , so it shouldn 't take more than ... 90 years . 90 years ? ! Hey , that 's not too bad . Did I say years ? Sorry . I meant minutes . 90 minutes . Sir ! I 'm so pleased you 're OK ! Not for long . In 90 minutes , we 're going to be hotter than me in a pair of silk Speedos ! What are we going to do ? We 're-we 're finished ! Oh , Kryten , we can do this . Alls we 've gotta do is get to the machine room and pull the plug on this loony . Now , if you can unscrew that wall panel , we 'll short-cut through the vents . Right away , sir . - Two minutes , we 'll be through . - No , you won 't . Your attempts to defeat me are futile . Oh , yeah ? How are you planning on stopping us ? Well , actually , sir , she controls all the ship 's functions ... .. so in many ways , her powers are limitless ! Gas is coming in through the vents ! Might that be laughing gas ? We 're in ! It 's sealed ! There 's no way through ! We 're screwed ! We 're defenceless ! Hey , Kryten , I can 't think straight with this toothache . It 's that one there , mate . Go on , pull it . Here comes the wall ! Here comes another one ! Hey , Kryten ! That crazy question you asked . I 've got the answer ! What question , 55 ? " Do Siamese sisters get whiskers in stasis ? " Nah , they don 't ! Quick medical , so we can set up his bios for stasis . ' Stasis ! Stasis ! Stasis ! Course ! What was I thinking ? I 've got it ! Pree ! All JMC vessels undertake to return crew to Earth , including their dependents , right ? You resigned , former crewman . There 's no way back . I didn 't resign . My dad did . We share the same name . Then you 'd be on file , and you 're not . Did you check the medibay waiting list ? Isn 't there a file open ? David Lister , medical pending ? - Yes . - Isn 't it true , once I complete my medical and I have all my bios for stasis , I become registered crew ? - Yes . - And as registered crew , do I have the power to shut you down ? - Yes . - And as your primary objective is to save registered crew members time and energy , shouldn 't you just uninstall yourself now ? Your logic is faultless . Rock and roll . Dave Lister saves the day . Being brave in a hostile universe . Mr David Lister Junior , sir , welcome aboard ! Morning , Krytes . Complimentary champagne and games package courtesy of the JMC . I 'm not interested , Krytes . I 've just signed up for the Robotics programme . Going to pass that sucker . So , alcohol , computer games - it 's hasta la vista , baby ! Go on , get ' em out of here . Get ... Zero-gee Total Football ? I didn 't know this was even out ! Kryten , grab yourself a remote and say goodbye to the weekend . Your MechBook 's going down , boy . Oh , and Kryten ... that champagne 's not going to open itself .

 I 'm sorry . Tom , it 's time for your daily reminder . Just start whenever you want . My name is Tom Jacobs . Born on November 2 , 1972 . My parents called Mark and Judith . My wife 's name is Abby . I would do anything for her voice . I am a prisoner in a homemade prison . I 'm bored again Minnie . - What would you like to do now Tom ? Let 's go somewhere . - Move , six minutes to implement . What now ? He is there to do ? Well it happens . He was very excited . The end of living in garages and beg for scholarships . Remember when I asked you first ? I said , " trust me they are going to pay . " And then you said that you had a boyfriend . - I never said that . Not true . - Okay , I 'm wrong . What is it ? - Open it . This we can not afford . - Not yet . But they will . I want you to have it tonight . I want you with me . Both of you . Five minutes Tom . - We have an offer . That is fantastic . - Let 's not get too excited . They want to know how exactly the machine . What about false memories ? The machine behaves like a polygraph . It looks difference between real and fake . It is difficult after a brain washing . But I have a solution . If the person is brainwashed and he has a latent memory . So hypnosis , cult stuff or something . The machine checks that first and if that is not there then the real memory . Listen , the customer has an idea . Imagine that you can go to other people 's memories ? Why would you do that ? - Where do I start ? Control of abused children . Alzheimer ... I 'm glad you understand the function . Richard , I was clear about what I wanted . I 'm just saying . - Sell my machine , nothing else . I tried . This is what they came up with . Who came along then ? - Everyone . You get the money you do not expect unless you compromises . If you just want to help people you you just for free . What do they offer ? It is unethical . You built this machine to traumas to find . That does not change , it still can . - And that should you decide ? With the knowledge I have ? Course . - So it begins . We burst of debt and want a family . It 'll be okay . - I deserve more than that . Relapse occurs in three minutes . I come to bring you money . Enough to start ? Yeah , that 's enough . But who invest in this ? - Someone who understands the possibilities . Remember that at the end of the day you have the rights and control . He has a few questions . The machine I used seemed good . Why we build a new one ? Upgrades . With the current program should someone still send . You should be able to go where you want once you 're inside . So I dive in memory ... - Can you hear me , Richard ? Yeah , I hear you Tom . - How it works ? No , memories are first sorted . So we create a virtual command post in the memory of the patient . How should the starting point look like ? - Maybe like this place ? this house ? - Yes , until we have something different . something more interesting ? - Yes . I start the capture . We need one voice . - I can do it . What ? - Why do not we a little style ? Maybe an actress hire ? Since they love . Do you think my voice has no style ? - No . How was that ? - Well , we go to the Z and then we 're done . How does it look ? Really attractive . - I mean the voice Romeo . Same there . Your memory is completed , Tom . Your memory is completed , Tom . - Let 's go . So I 'm at the start point and I find a memory where I want ? And then I 'm there ? Is it that simple ? - It 's so simple . How far can you go back in memory ? - As far as memory permits . Limits loom if you on the border of memory comes . The world consists of things that are unreal . The machine generates them randomly . Things and people . Self leaves no trace behind . Then the last question , how do we get out ? - The user makes out . And if something goes wrong ? We 're working on . Minnie ? Destroy yourself please . destruct in five , four ... three , two , one . Goodbye Tom . destruct failed . Remember that I 'm not evil . Should I get a diagnosis ? How long have I been caught Minnie ? - Four years , two months , three days . Are you ready ? I do not know if I have a life outside this place . Or anyone know that I 'm alive . Hello ? Honey , it 's Richard . Hello . Tomorrow ? We would have six weeks Tom . Our investors expecting now some progress . Think of everything we have not yet tested . Dummy Memories . Unknown faces . - Use yourself . Photos then ? - Take something . Richard understands . Okay , but I object . An official protest . We need at least another month . You protest is listed . Let 's begin . Ready ? - Yes . I love you . - I love you . you stay awake for me ? Where do you want it ? - Put it down simply . What 's this ? Who is your investor ? - It 's complicated . Make it easier than . Who is that ? Arthur Kennison , from prison . They want to memory suspects go . So you know whether they are guilty . - Would willingly go ? No , if it works , it becomes mandatory . Stylish 180-degree turn . I can pack in ten minutes . You drew my checks . - I trusted you . You did this for six months and you said nothing . - I told you that someone sees what . That 's no lie . I want to give you a chance . - Nonsense , you give yourself a chance . Okay , maybe I 'm looking to something important . But you have to understand something . You 're not the only one who is working on . You 're the first but how long will that take ? here I had another idea . - Forget your ideas but . It 's all about control . Think you can take their money without consequences ? How long have you been at man ? Think about it . Think about your family , Tom . Mr. Jacobs ? Are we still doing this ? Let 's begin . Who we enter ? - We caught him recently . His name is Anthony Willis . His father is a murderer for the Mafia , a zero . What has he done ? - He 's a junkie . He was home and got an SMS from his girl goes to her sister ... and kills her . Apparently . He had a blackout , he says . Take something meaningful out of his brains and you have my interest . Have you forced him to be here ? - Forced ? No , he is pleased with the opportunity . A perfect guinea pig . Willingness and expendable . It seems like a nice guy . Just a sedative . The process does not hurt . Maybe not for me . It 's a wild state there . It takes a few seconds . Why we anesthetize him ? - It makes everything more stable . We are ready . I have the details needed . If the program works you must tell me now what happens ? You 're looking for an exact data from millions . I need something to start . Okay , I accept that . The boy 's file . Someone saw his car on a bridge near of the crime scene at two o 'clock at night . hours after her death of these . We searched the area and found the murder weapon with his fingerprints . Let 's begin . Okay , good luck . Tom , can you hear me ? Tom , can you hear me ? Tom , can you hear me ? I hear you . - Minnie , you hear me ? Welcome Tom . My name is Minnie . What would you like to do ? Minnie show everything I see on the screen . - As you wish Tom . We see it clear . - Beautiful . Search memories with these words : Adrienne , murder , Regan . Search . A reminder found with those words . Minnie Take me there . I am inside . Adrienne , open up . That does not look familiar . - The machine fills the holes . How long will it take before anything ... I 'm sorry . Minnie how much of this memory is real . - Processing . information about his youth is 17 % . Normal values . And then his deeds ? 95 % . - 95 % . Extremely large for a reminder . Dad , something bad happened . The memory is over , Tom . that we had imagined . He took methadone to self soothe phoned his father and left . So he lied about not remember ? Perhaps unaware . Junkies often have blackouts . That explains why he convinced that he is innocent . I must say I am very impressed , Tom . Get me out of here now , Gary . Goodbye , Tom . What the hell ? - What would you like to do now ? Gary , I 'm back at the beginning . That 's strange . I try again . Goodbye , Tom . Hello , Tom . What would you like to do now ? It did not work . - What happens ? What happens ? - The extraction does not work . Restore . A kind of misunderstanding . He 's working on it . Tom , we will delete everything and it out later ? But no " I told you so , when I 'm out . - Forget it . Minnie , destroy yourself . - Are you sure ? destruct in five , four , three , two ... . Goodbye , Tom . When will he wake up ? - That would be . It is destroyed . The chipset comes off the vessel . Yes , it 's gone . Why is he still missing ? Tom , can you hear me ? Can you hear me , Tom ? You 're not listening to me . - I did not do it . You had placed high . You took the gun from her hand ... No , that 's not true . - Look , Anthony . You love us for three days on the line . Confess now but . You grabbed the gun and shot her . You have a visitor . Hi , Daddy . You are very skinny . Are you eating enough ? - Yeah , you know . I wanted to give you this . I took some photos when I was tidying up the attic . Thank you . They started a carpentry course last week . I 've been there . It 's really interesting . I imagine that I outgrowth of a carpenter . You look amazingly thin . - Yes , I told you , Dad . I use nothing if you think that . They get nothing inside today . you say that , Anthony ... What are you doing ? - Are you happy ? Take me not fool boy . Your job is to clean up . I 've done that too . you do not screw up . - I give you my word . Does that mean anything ? Not for me . Always nice talking to you , Dad . Sit . Just sit . Dad , how I let him down ? - I already told you , Anthony . If you want him to sit then push his butt down and repeat it . Sit . Boy , give me the 9 / 16 we go . That 's a 5 / 8 . - That 's a 5 / 8 . Sorry . That 's it , boy . We have a birthday gift for your mother buy . a car ? - A car ? Yes . - Are you crazy ? How many times have I been in this memory ? - Al 430 times . 430 times . to the music than . What is the date anyway ? - 15 July . We missed the fireworks . Tomorrow we must find something to celebrate . Picnic , barbecue ? What do you think ? I understand the question , Tom . - No , of course not . But I would like it . Sit . I 've said 100 times that dog is stupid . Give daddy a beer . Minnie , was what the fuck ? He saw me . That is not possible . - Do not tell me that it can not , he saw me . Look at me . Thank you , boy . Am I crazy , Minnie ? He saw me . Your theory is impossible . Close the memory and start again before he asked for beer . At the restart . I 've said 100 times that dog is stupid . Give daddy a beer . Look at me . Do you see me ? Anthony . Thank you , boy . He looked at me Minnie . I 'm sure . The process is repeated three times . Your theory seems to be impossible . What was so special with memory ? that particular time ? Minnie , what time was it when I said that Anthony saw me ? I can see the exact time of not currently determination . No , the real time reality . The time was 4 : 15 , 15 July . I want you to show what Anthony at that exact moment did . scanning short-term memory . Look . He sees me , right ? The lights are about five minutes . You were thinking of that memory . You thought of the memory , at the same time I in you . active memory . So he saw me , Minnie . I can not verify your theory , Tom . - You do not . ANTHONY 'S PICTURES I have to meet him again . Minnie , I need to see the memory most used . I can not recall memories by frequency of use . and frequency of words ? Something he thinks a lot . In a therapy session , for example ? Search . I think about it all the time . I was with a friend . A part-time dealer , Eric Lowe . A strange type . Take me to that memory , Minnie . I desperately wanted a shot . I needed money and I knew only a place where I could get . How long should we wait ? I need the car back to my brother , otherwise he beats me rotten . There he goes . - Are you sure he 's in his pocket ? He comes from his accountant . What the fuck is that ? you rob him with your shoe ? - Give me that . Fuck . - Give it to me . Get it . Asshole . - Calm down , chief . Let 's do it . Give your money . - Do you know who robbed you ? No , why do not you tell me ? Do not make me have to cut , old man . What are you doing ? - What are you doing ? I want to see your face , before I shoot off . Dad . Daddy ? That day haunts me . How low can a son fall ? Then I thought Adrienne . And the person I could be without my under the control of the stuff I. Despite the evidence , my past . The police and my own father . I see myself not . Not against her . Nobody can see except me . If no suffering . I do not deserve it . - I give it , because I want you deserve . see it as a contribution to the ' new ' you . You are at the end of this remembrance come , what do you do now ? We wait here . Keep repeating this reminder , until he shows up . How long have I been here , Minnie ? - Two weeks , Tom . You can see me . You can see me , right ? you recognize me ? My name is Tom Jacobs . Minnie , you see this , I 'm not hallucinating ? He hears me . Talk to me , I know you can hear me . Talk to me . What ? - Enough . What ? Talk to me , what did you say ? - I said enough . What the hell you on ? What are you doing , Tom ? We wait . Welcome back . Can you hear me ? - Yes . Well , that 's great . It is very important that you understand everything , what I 'm saying . I 've been here four years prison . My wife 's name is Abby Jacobs . I can still remember her phone . If you want me to leave here , then you call her and tell where I am . She was suspicious , so I 'll tell you everything , what to say to her . If we lose another way , then come back to this place , because I will wait . okay ? - Yeah , I was just lost in thought . I hope you 're not wrong idea . But this is our third date . Maybe it was not a good idea . No , I 've just had a rough day . Do you understand me ? know what ? Let us arrange another time . I look at my work schedule and call you then . That sounds fine . Hello ? Am I speaking with Abby Jacobs ? - Yes , I speak it . My name is Anthony Willis . Can I help you ? I have with your spouse spoken . creep . If you think you 're funny , let 's see if police also found . Your father died of a heart attack , when you was 23 . Tom was your friend . You could not bear how your dad a chest covered , so you ran to the beach . Tom came to you and wanted not leave when you asked . You hid under the sheets and he talked against you until the sun went down . During early that morning he you to marry . And you told him that he the worst timing ever . And you asked him why he a scatterbrain like you wanted to marry . And he said he took what he could get , as long as you but was . If only the smallest part . That was enough . I saw the whole conversation . I can see everything you 've done seconds earlier , in the short term memory . She believed you . Which means they will come , to talk to you . There are still a few things , you should tell her . I think I know what went wrong that day and how we can solve . I know everything about you . You played football as a child . You were at your uncle named . Your friend gave you your first painkiller , when you were only 14 years old . I have the best and the worst of you seen . I 've seen your crimes . But I also regret seen . This is your chance to do the right thing . Will you help me ? You think I want you hanging around ? I want to believe you . I really do . Maybe there 's another way to explain what you know . So I have a question . If you really can talk to him , then you can answer this . What do you know ? His nickname for me . You have five minutes , ma 'am . - Thank you . Are you still there ? I can not just talk to him . We a place where we meet . I 'm sure his memory now runs , give me an answer . He can see us ? - He can see what I see . This is his daughter , Donna . Take me to the meeting , Minnie . - Localize . Can you see him or not ? - I see him yet . I have no idea what I 'm doing here . - Wait . If you tried to make me stupid happen , then you are successful . Wait , give me a second . Birdie . He calls you Birdie . reminder that I can live forever . Okay , write this down . If I 'm still here , that means , that the chip is still inside you . I think the self-destruction the chip is damaged . I have searched and he was gone . - Not everything , according to Tom . Why was it not seen on the scan ? - It only responds to the metal parts . prototypes of my chips , are made of silicon . The new ones are made of monocrystalline , why you saw them . In my haste , I have the scanner never reprogrammed . It had taken just minutes . It 's not your fault . - And now what ? I have permission to Tom from the hospital to pick up . Anthony And then ? Richard . - Richard ? He can still help me with the prison paper . Abby , it 's Richard . I 've just spoken to them . He must stay here . I could not get out . - Does that mean it 's over ? I said I could get him out . - I do not understand . I even have my priorities . I send you his information . Mr. Kennison ? - There 's nothing I can do , sorry . push him into a corner , because there will be nobody else for your husband fight . I own a farm near here . I would order a transfer questions ... and some guards who managed to keep their mouths . If I just was motivated . What do you mean by that ? machine , Mrs. Jacobs . What do you think about him to give me ? I understand that this is a difficult decision for you . Then you know me yet . the Rule . I must be honest . It 's hard to unwind when I know you 're watching . gets you out , you promise that you some things for yourself . You can feel lonely in the cell . I do not want people to judge me . I hate this place . Shall we choose another place ? Come with me , wimp . - Nobody 's stopping you . So you keep just sit and do nothing ? Maybe I have just sitting here , while I look at you . Okay . Last chance . Come , wimp . Come in .. That was long . Nice place . We came here , whenever we could . I think we now four months together . Have you been here before ? That 's hard to say . My memory is cloudy . I do not know what to me , or your hear . This is definitely mine . This is a ... better place . you remember the last time , that we met ? You said it would not hurt . Since then I have pain . Why did you do that thing built ? I do not remember . I guess because I wanted to help people . So they deal with the past could come and their traumas could handle . world a better place . That sounds like a cliché , right ? Somewhere along I 've lost my focus . It was less about what I could give and more about what I could get . Do you regret it ? every day . You can not change the past . Maybe you do next invention ? I definitely buy a ticket . I 'm going tonight . They let me leave this place . - Just like that ? Where fuck are you going ? They bring me to a place before surgery . They say it 's painless . Computers and machines will the most work . I must stay overnight and the next day I can go again . If he tries anything , we 're outside . And then what ? A transfer to another prison . - Great . That sounds great . - That guy needs my help . I 've already told you years ago that you not to join that program should do . I tried to prove my innocence . - Your innocence ? That night you called me , you told me everything . You remember that maybe not , but I do . Dad , something bad happened . I had to pick . I watched my son a overdose had in the back ... while I was tidying up his mess . I kept my mouth shut , against the police for you . You 're right where you are now . And now they bring you to an unknown place . I will not use again . - Do you believe it yourself , Anthony ? There is only a weak moment and you need lapse into your old habits . I try to do the right thing . You have in your whole life never done properly . And now you 're mad , right ? And I 'm a bad father , because I do not believe you . I have saved more than I can count . But I 'm done , Anthony . You may hate me , but all I 've done , I 've done for you . Do you still you 're innocent ? - Yes . Prove it . He was right . What is that thing ? This is what I need to build . Each chip has a source frequency . And this send a signal every second , to that frequency to intercept . If we are connected to the signal Tom , then we need you ... to tell us in what he 's memory . Tell him that he should stay . Then we filter that memory by the device . We bring the body of Tom inside and do the swap . Are you sure it will work ? - I think the same chance of success ... but it 's the best chance we have . - How long ? We begin within one hour and whole process will take about four hours . Basically what it will take longer . What do you mean ? - You need me . I have a request for Tom . I know that he can see . Tom , I have good cooperated do not you think ? I want something from you . I want to know what 's on the night of the murder happened . I 've seen what happened . You killed your girlfriend . There is more happened than I my own life saved by the police . I want proof . I want to prove that they were wrong . We do not have time for . - Then it time . I first want to know if he has listened and agree . So Tom ... I await your answer . You lied to me . You want me here for the rest of your life I ? You killed her , is not that enough ? - I 'm not a murderer . Start with her . - You were angry and you let her suffer ? I thought you could see everything ? - Acts , no emotions . So you see only a picture book . You do not know what they meant to me . You can not bluff . You 're not an angel . Every time you hurt someone , or threatened , I saw it . That his actions . - Who has not done bad things ? You only know my past . I know my suffering . Really , who are past do you ? Of the person against whom I talk ... or the person with the needle in his arm ? The police and your father think you 've done , even I think you did . So we have it all wrong ? The evidence is wrong ? I 'm wrong ? You did it , Anthony . So what 's the point ? The point is that something else happened that night . There was another man and I want to know who he is . A random memory search , is looking for a needle in a haystack . I 'll tell you everything I can remember , I will lead you . Even if there was someone else , then you have still killed her . not accidental . Not in self-defense . Create the resource if the goal is horrible ? - For me . you think there is no price for your freedom would be , Tom ? I would have thought that I was dealing with a decent man . Well , we all make mistakes , not true . Maybe I for people like you a guinea pig ... but now you do what I say because I 'm the only chance you get home . You have until tomorrow morning before being transferred . If you want my help , you must first help me . Abbey , there is a small delay . You do not have to worry . Is Tom there ? - Yeah , he 's about an hour . Good . Stay there and I 'll call you when it again goes smoothly . Let 's begin . Tell me about Adrienne . Everything you know . We had two year relationship . She was not really easy . From the beginning not . Family Problems . Suicide Attempt 16 . When we first met , she by me to the hard stuff . In the beginning we klooiden but what . But then ... She was my whole world . And I wish we stopped because we were killing each other . But she could not . matter how hard I tried , I could not help her . And one day she just left . She did not say why . She took her phone anymore . And then I became in a downward spiral . And the next time I saw her , she was dead . We have a signal . We are waiting only for you two . The clock is ticking . You said there that night something else happened ? Tell me everything you can remember . Minnie , get ready for this to locate . I remember I woke up in the bath after I heard broken glass . I had a bottle of pills and had beaten back Adrienne 's gun at me . I 've got a splitting headache . Do not know how long I was unconscious . The house is unknown to me . I remember that pictures the chimney stood . In the guest room was a sofa and a TV . Do the program stops . And on the bookshelf stood a clock . I heard noise . Turned around . Blackout . I did not even have time to my pistol draw . Minnie , put the attacker down . Alternates . Everywhere alternates . The memory true but for 5 % . Nothing contextueels . You do not even know who or where . - But the memory is real ? Yes . - Then you have to keep digging . Come to it . Look again . - Is three times is not enough ? Everywhere alternates . Even the magazines . The attacker is a dead end . There is simply not enough . What do you want me to do ? I never said anything about magazines . - Does not matter . They were there . You remember them , just not what they were . Now that you mention it , I remember them me . They were porn magazines . No , that I had seen . You are confused by another reminder . Is that so ? Minnie , how accurate is this picture ? - 100 % Reminders . That you learn during your PhD . You have a seven course meal . You remember nothing . But when I say that you had steak , you remember that you also had potatoes . memory unravels . You just need a little helping . Anthony , this is not enough . You must share with me your thoughts . We must do this together . So sit here and concentrate . I tell you everything I see and you have something to teach . It 's all there . I just bring it forward . The first thing is ... This was not a porno mag . What was it , Anthony ? It was about tattoos . The rest also . Right . Good . There was suddenly something else visible . A purple bottle ? A perfume bottle . There were many at that sink . Good . What color was the carpet , Anthony ? Red , I think . Or Orange . - No , it was red . The towels also . Red and black . And part ? - A drawing of a train . shower curtain . That is the first what I say . It was weird . There was a strange pattern . Stains . Indeed . The whole bathroom was clean . Everything fits together . You remember . Let 's see what else you remember . Minnie , do me the pass rates . - Memory , 25 % accurate . Anthony , here 's something . A photo in the hall . It is a drawing . Soldiers . 35 % accurate . Anthony , there is now a whole new room . - There is a pink towel on the bench . photos on the wall . A hat . A coffee table with a book on it . bookshelf . The TV is on . - There are cartoons . Anthony , the clock changes the time ever . What time is it , Anthony ? Come on . Think . What time is it ? - 1 : 35 pm . Minnie , set this reminder again . Anthony , if you do all those little things can remember ... I 'm sure you also remember the great . why he was in her house ? - No idea . But the memory is real . And the time . The cop said when she died . What if he did ? - Anthony , I saw you do it . Maybe you 're wrong . - I 'm not wrong . I did my part , now you must do your part . Tell him Garrett that I will wait for our meeting . A deal is a deal . I 'm gonna pee . Can I get one of those ? Throw the gun away . Give me the keys . Anthony , do this well . They 'll come after you . If you die , die Tom also . Come on , Anthony . Where are you ? I 'm coming Sodeju . Since when are you free ? - Not very long . Come . Seems like an eternity ago . Want a oppeppertje ? It 's free . Very funny , asshole . You were that night at Adrienne 's house . I do not know what you 're talking about . Do not tell me that with her sister was on the night she died . Look who has everything reminds . - Why did you kill her ? You 're insane . - Do not lie . I did not kill her . I was there but I did not do anything . When I walked in , she was already dead . I heard footsteps and I hid . And then I saw you . a gun . I panicked and hit you down . The cops have never questioned me . What was I supposed to do ? Why were you in her house ? - Why do you think ? She would never start with you . you think ? corpse why you so frightened ? She is by you started it . Because of you , she had come to me . What do you mean ? We had some sort of agreement . I gave her drugs and they gave me what I needed . Guilt . Why she broke up with you . She wanted to tell you really like . But you know what I think ? I think you that night drove to her house . Truly a twisted mess . I think she told you everything . And why did you shoot her mess . I 'm sorry . not move . Give me that gun . All this over a girl . I thought we were friends . What do you do now ? The cops call . - You can not come here . He 's right , you know . What 's this ? Listen . Should you feel any better , they really wanted to quit . Really . The problem was that it was my drug . I told her that if she ever would break our agreement ... that I would shoot her through her head . So thank you my dirty work have been refurbished . Minnie , locate everything what is happening now . Minnie ? - My name is Minnie . What would you do ? I said , locate everything what is happening now . to locate . Subject damaged . - Why did you do it ? I was so close . I was almost there . System Fault . Talk to me , coward . Look at me . You gotta get me out of here , Anthony . There is something wrong with Minnie . You promised . What you gonna do now ? Look at me . What will you do now ? I 'm going to do what 's best for me . Your prototype still works , right ? - Yes . I can go to your apartment . To your wife . They can do it if you let me explain . Tell me everything . Let 's do this . early withdrawal Ready . What now ? - He said he would wait for me . Pull it out on my signal . Can you see him ? I lost him . - What do you mean , you lost it . I do not see him . Tom , where are you going ? Why am I here , Minnie ? - I do not understand . Filtering ... not filter , Minnie . I have to go to another memory . Are you sure ? - Anthony , stay with me , okay ? Minnie , I still need a reminder . Take me there now . What would you do , Tom ? This is his daughter , Donna . - I would live forever . I know where he 's going . You have arrived . Come on , Tom . Stay with me , okay ? Hello , Tom . What do you do ? Anthony , come here . Look at me . Tell me what you wanted to do . Come on , Tom . Anthony , tell me what to do . Are you there last ? Goodbye , Tom . Can you take it ? - Do you sometimes somewhere else ? Last chance . My name is Tom Jacobs . Born on 12 November 1972 . My parents are Mark and Judith . My wife called Abbey . I would give anything to her again my name hearsay . My father fought in the war . He did not believe in psychology ... or post-traumatic stress . He always said that war was just like going to the beach . You 'll come home with some sand . This was on his 15th birthday . Rex . I remember that dog as well . It seems like mine was . It was a show dog that I had received . Rex was a show dog ? Basel What now ? He could not even sit on command . Pooped under the house . Chewed on the furniture . You sound just like my son . - What are you talking about ? I gave him away because another trainer gave me a good offer . I told Anthony that he did difficult and the thing under pooped . If your child says something often enough , he believe . That dog behaved badly . Anthony saw it . I saw it . Anthony saw nothing . Rex was a great dog . you remember that right ? You remember it right ? I grab another beer . You too ? - No , thanks . Dad , what if I let it sit ? - Through repetition , Anthony . If your child says something often enough , he believe . Anthony , I have so often said . This dog is oerdom . When it comes to brainwashing the line is blurred , but I can work around . What is brainwashing ? Hypnosis , cult programming . Can it be defined ? Bad people you edit . Maybe Anthony poorly conditioned to think that his dog was stupid . Sit . Good . You can make a thousand ways manipulate . Some are as innocent as a father with his son talk . Anthony could become convinced , where one could still convince him ? From what the police said . - Look what you 've done . To his father 's disappointment . - Does my word nothing ? What he could be more than you believe ? - I 'm sorry . I can not be part of your life . I 'm sorry . We received an anonymous tip . Someone saw his truck stop on a bridge ... near the crime scene around two o 'clock in the morning . You gave the anonymous tip . You have that letter , right ? - What are you talking about ? not play games with me . You set him up so what do you know ? That does not matter anymore . - Yes , for me it out . Anthony has called you that night . What did he tell you ? Yeah , he called me up . but what he stammered . Sounded like another lie . Addicts who lie simply . How could you ? It was your son . - There was no sensible word out . So you protected yourself ? - I protected him . It was a matter of time before they would find him dead somewhere . When he awoke in the morning and said there was nothing he could remember ... when I took my decision and I set him up . When I came out of jail , I kicked the habit . Do you have a child ? Yes . - What would you have done ? Guilt is a powerful thing . It is imperative . It is an obsession . And you have a choice . Whether you keep it down ... or you can change . I think she thought she neither of them could do . Experimental project is further put . What if he can convince the people actually it works ? I do not know why I let you go . Fixed force of habit . I understand . What is this ? Sometimes you just a familiar voice .

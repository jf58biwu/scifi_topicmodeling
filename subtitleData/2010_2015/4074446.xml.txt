 I got a great idea . All right . Goth chicks like it in the basement . What was that noise ? It 's only the , uh , furnace , Anthony . Don 't be afraid . Hey , Marcy ! What 's goin ' on ? Hello ? Hey , come on ! Come on , open the door ! Aaaahhhh , ahhhhh , ahhhhh ! Ahhhhhhh ! Oh , God ! In the last five days , these five students have gone missing . My theory ? It has something to do with the book . Well , maybe they just quit school . That 's your theory ? Think about it . If they quit school , then they have no reason to show up . Try not to think so hard , Todd , you 'll give yourself an aneurism . Todd may actually have a point . Hannah agrees with Todd , why am I not surprised ? Just because something inexplicable happens doesn 't mean the book is responsible , Jenny . Is the book responsible for you being a total witch ? I don 't know why Jenny thinks I 'm such a loser . Listen up Todd , if your goal is to gently caress Jenny 's fun-bags , there 's only one solution . Make her jealous . Well , how do I do that ? You bang one of her friends . You know what ? Bang all of her friends . But ... Jenny doesn 't really have any friends . Well , except for Marcy . She is pretty hot , too . All right , well , there you have it , all right ? Seek out this sex pot known as Marcy , and you bang her until Jenny sees the light . This Todd Smith is starting to get in the way . Maybe he 's the one the prophecy speaks of . Tell us you 've investigated this boy . Of course I have . Do you think I was born yesterday ? Oh , he 's a student at crowley high , so he 's , high-school age , which at crowley could be anywhere between fourteen and twenty five . He is a male , his name is Todd . Smit h . No middle name . That I know of . Silence ! Follow the boy . Observe his movements . Take notes . Yes , your evilness . Don 't screw this up , atticus . Hey Marcy ! Marcy ! You look terrible , what 's up ? I don 't wanna talk about it . Well look , I 'm sorry we haven 't been hanging out lately , I 've just sorta been caught up in stuff . That 's okay . I 've been kinda caught up in stuff too . Hey . Todd . I 'm here too , you know . Yup , good for you . So , Marcy ... Marcilicious ... how would you like to ... my house , tonight . Seven o 'clock ? What , really ? Oh , I 'm sorry , did I just make you jealous ? Don 't be an idiot . I may be an idiot ... but , I 'm an idiot with a hot date . ♪ ♪ Knock-knock-knock hey . These are for you . I thought you 'd like them ' cause they 're dead and gothy . Hey , dude . What are you doing here ? Marcy invited me . Pretty sweet , huh ? And look , corn chips ! You heard of these guys ? Uh , yeah . They 're awesome . Awesome . You guys make yourself comfortable , and I 'll be right back . This is kinda weird . Why would she invite both of us over , unless ... I think Marcy wants to have an orgy . I 've never orgied before , how does it work ? Do we take turns , or do we roll around buck naked together ? No , I 'm outta here . I can 't let you go . Dude , the only reason I 'm here is to get Jenny jealous . I respect that . But not only are we going to lose our virginities , we 're gonna get laid . Guys , I 'm in the basement , And I 'm not wearing anything ! Dude , she totally wants us . If you leave there 's no us , it 's just me and she may not want just me . She may be one of those chicks that needs like two jocks . Please , Todd , do this for me . Man . Two minutes ago I thought the highlight of my night was gonna be that bowl of corn-chips . So help me God , Curtis ... if your sword crosses my sword , I am outta here . No sword crossage . Got it . Marcy ? Curtis ? Curtis , are you okay ? Curtis ? I landed on something squishy . Oh , good squishy , or bad squishy ? Mmmmm . Definitely good squishy . Bad squishy ! Bad squishy ! Sorry , guys . Hello , boys ! Ahhhhhhhhhh ! Whack ! I 'll get you for that ! Ahhhhhhhh ! And that ! You little wacko ! Ahhhhhhhh ! Ahhhhhhhh ! Help ! Ahhhhhhhh ! ♪ Not my face ! Shuuz , shuuz ! This is our guidance counselor . Let 's go . You failed us , Marcy . Wait wait wait ... I 'll get you more bodies , I swear to God . Perhaps a little incenti ve is in order . Wait , guys come on ! How ' bout a little finger food ? We just escaped from the window and ran all the way home ! Dude we didn 't run , you dorksack . We just , like , walked fast . Dude , we ran home like a couple of frightened little babies . Oh , thank gosh you 're alive . Hey , guys . How was your date with Marcy ? Ahhhhhh ! It went that bad , huh ? Ahhhhhh ! Stop it . Sebastian fury and raven . They fronted the goth band called the bram stoker explosion . We ran away from a pansy-hatch goth band ? They stayed awake for thirty-six days straight recording that album . And when they crashed ... they never woke up . Until Marcy got her hands on the book of pure evil . That 's why she 's been acting so strange . She 's got a couple of zombies stashed in her basement . And she 's luring sexy guys into her place with the promise of orgies and corn-chips . Does anyone have a plan ? Actually ... I do . You 're spreading lies about me ! Marcy , you 're feeding guys to zombies ! Fair enough ! Okay , it all started last week ... my parents were giving me grief . About my clothes , my music , my grades , my attitude , blah , blah , blah ... so I lost it . I hate your guts and I wish you weren 't my parents ! What a terrible thing to say . The next day I find this weird book . So , I decided to replace my parents with my favourite rock stars . Of course I didn 't expect them to come back as zombies . So what happened to your folks ? Right , my folks ... We 're still hungry . So freaking hungry ! I 'll get more . Lots more ! So , I started bringing boys home from school . Sorry , guys . Hey , it could happen to anyone . We 'll just take a rain check on that orgy . Are we prepared to take on two sadistic flesh eating zombies ? Heck yeah . But first , we gotta load up . On drugs . Close . Hey , Jimmy , I need to bor ... Jimmy , miss valarie ... I need to borrow a few questionable items . I 'm not responsible if I don 't see it . Oh , uh , miss valarie , I 'm gonna need another extension on that math assignment . Where is that rotten little wench ? You know , I 'm so freaking hungry , I could eat myself . Sebastian , you gotta check out this book , man . It 's the answer to all our prayers . Yeah , well can you eat the freaking thing ? I don 't think so ! Hold on a minute ... here we go . An all you can eat . Hey , Jenny . I 'm really sorry about all this . You 're not the only kid who doesn 't get along with their parents . How could you have known it would lead to cannibalism and murder ? Hey , when all this over , do you wanna like , hang out again ? You know , like old times ? Yeah , sure . All right , everybody , listen up . When we get to Marcy 's house , Jenny and I will take the back ... Where are you little dudes going ? Uh , none of your business ? Does it have anything to do with the two zombies that just walked in the school ? Everybody , back inside ! Loser . You sure he 's the one ? Yes , I 'm sure . Just give him some time . All right gang , let 's spread out . Jenny and I will cover jock hall . Curtis and Hannah , you cover nerd alley . Take Marcy with you . Keep your eyes peeled . If you hear or see anything , or something tries to eat you , scream real loud . All right , let 's move out ! Where the hell is atticus ? Ladies and gentlemen , parents and teachers , I 'm here to tell you your kids are out of control , exclamation point . Double exclamation point . I just wanted to let you know that , um , nothing happened between me and Marcy . And Curtis . Why would I care one way or another ? You don 't care that I almost had an orgy with your best friend ? I 'm glad you weren 't eaten alive by zombies , okay ? Did you hear that ? Whack ! That 's our guidance counselor , Curtis . We should do something . Let 's hit him in the head again and give him amnesia ! Uh , there 's actually a 98 % chance that that won 't happen . Okay , so what you 're saying is that there 's a good 3 % chance that it will . No , that 's not what I 'm saying . Where 's Marcy ? ♪ What have you done to Marcy ? Don 't worry , she 's safe and sound . Safe and sound in our gullets ! Ha ha ha ! Prepare to die , you undead limeys ! Let 's be blunt . Your kids live in a society that glorifies acts of brutality and carnage . What should you , as parents , do ? For the love of gosh , would someone please shut that door ? Stop turning a blind eye to what 's happening ! Ahhhhhhh ! The only solution , Is to cut your kids off from the outside world . Lock them inside their rooms and don 't let them out until you drop them back off to the warmth and safety of this education facility ! Let 's start with the pretty one . No ! Wait ! So how ' bout this ? You give us the book , and you can have the parents , and the teachers . You mean this book ? Here 's what gonna happen , first we 're gonna eat you little weasels , and then we 're gonna use this book to get back on top of the charts . Freakin ' heck . You mean we 've gotta go back to work ? This is just like that jumping album all over again , can 't take a day off , oh no . You have to stay awake for thirty-six bloody days straight . And look what happens to us now . We 're dead ! Todd , catch ! Thud Look what you did to my baby . Just when we were about to make a comeback . Well , now this is personal . You picked the wrong zombie to fuss with ! Eat me ! Thud you zombies are dead ! Again ! Yeah ! Grab it ! It keeps doing that ! ♪ ♪ Are you okay ? She was my best friend . And now she 's gone . Goodbye , Marcy . I hope there 's an all ages goth bar in heaven . Jenny ... do you wanna cry on my shoulder ? That wasn 't meant to be totally sexual ! You know what the worst part about this is ? We never got to have our orgy . Uh , trust me dude , I 'm still gonna have my orgy and you 're not gonna be there . In your dreams . Which , by the way , is like the only place you 'll ever have an orgy . As long as it 's a Curtis-free orgy dream , I have no problem with that . Good squishy . Ladies ... let 's get this orgy started . Best dream ever .

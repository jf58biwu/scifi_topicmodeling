Code-Name Hero . Seymour Simmons . Bill . Big fan . Great to be here . you would have us believe that it is in our best interest to formally take sides in this so-called alien civil war ? so I wouldn 't exactly call it a toss-up .

Sam ? or we 'd rather have him ? I hear you . I get it . Where are you taking my bunny ? Stop ! Just stop for a second . You think I could sleep last night ? Sam wants to be in danger . - He doesn 't know who he is without it . - I just want to matter . You matter to me . I know you 're worried . I know you 're worried . I can handle this . Can you ? You can promise it ? I promise . and I know where this leads . I 'm not ready for this . Are you coming with me ? I can 't . Okay . Hey . Here 's your foot . The warrior 's path is a solitary one .

Luna 4 sees ... - Strange rocks . - Yeah . Around the ship . Hundreds of them . show picture . With some drag marks . these are pillars . Alien pillars for a space bridge . We know about them because the Autobots have five of these . and hid them . It doesn 't make sense . The Decepticons have the ship . They have all those pillars . Why would they leave Sentinel when he 's the only one who can use them ? Unless ... He 's the one thing they still need . rendezvous with him and keep him safe . I just picked up Sentinel . Optimus is 10 minutes behind . We 're coming to NEST now . I thought I made it clear to you that I did not want you calling this phone . the whole thing has been a setup since the beginning . The Decepticons wanted Optimus to find Sentinel because only Optimus could revive him . But we have the space bridge . you have five pillars . I just learned that they have hundreds . You 're doing exactly what they wanted you to do . What do you need me to say to you ? The Decepticons are coming for Sentinel Prime ! We 're going to NEST . We have an Energon alert . Energon readings detected on the D. C. Parkway . Currently tracking three black Suburbans . you got to get Sentinel out of here ! You got to guard him ! mein Gott ! I 'm fired ! Watch out !

'cause he 's the key to the whole thing . is we were never going to win the war . a deal had to be made with Megatron . - Get back ! - What have you done ? I hereby discharge you from duty . - Bee ! - Get back ! Rally all NEST forces back to the base ! Come on ! No ... Get a medic down here ! We don 't have enough men ! Do not engage Sentinel ! Just go to the back gate . Tak e cover ! Watch left ! Watch left ! Let 's go ! Follow me ! don 't go there ! - Stand down ! Sentinel ! - Director ! - What is going on ? What do you think you are doing ? I am a Prime ! I do not take orders from you . come on . We can 't fight him . Let 's go . We have to go . Now return what belongs to me ! my God ! - You guys okay ? - Is everybody out ? stay calm . You 're gonna be fine . Optimus ! This is all on you ! Sentinel hit the vault ! Took the pillars . notify the 101St Airborne ! We need to hunt this thing down ! Carly ! Hot from our little campfire . S 'mores . Isn 't that great ? We 're really living off the land . have you guys seen Carly come home yet ? please ? This is our bedroom . Why wouldn 't she be at home ? or be on a break . I don 't really know . I can 't talk about it right now . Mom . I have to find her . Sit down . We 're having a family meeting . Family meeting ! but your father and I were not always this perfectly happy . there was a time in our marriage when I thought this was not gonna work out . - Can we please not ? - She 's damaging him . You break up with one world-class hottie ... I moved on to something better . That 's it . I 'm a happier person . and you lose her . Why don 't you help me ? - They had an argument . - One fight . unless you have like a big ... What the ... Ma ! Maybe you just don 't know what you 're doing . - I don 't want to talk about this anymore . - You need the book . - Tell him about the book . - You 're always wrong . Get used to it . Okay .

Back me up ! happy life . - Heck yeah . stone-cold misery for the rest of your ... - Stop . - It 's true . do you love this girl ? - She 's the one . - Then you gotta go get her . he moved heaven and earth to find me . Say what you said . Say it . I will follow you to the end of time . Does that suck or what ? - It 's like a bad sci-fi film . - No . It is so sweet . I want you to get out of the city . You get as far away from here as you can . You understand ? I love you . My master ! Such a brilliant scheme ! it was to defect ? He was meant to rendezvous with me here on Earth before fate waylaid us both . we needed Prime and his Matrix . Excellent strategy . mine ! master ? He is my greatest triumph . So impressive . Commencing transport . Sentinel ! Forgive me . Here we are . Fight us now . Contact ! Watch out ! Move it ! Move it ! retreat ! why ? For Cybertron ! For our home ! we can rebuild ! But only if we join with the Decepticons . it 's not the only way . This is our home ! We must defend the humans ! Optimus . we were gods . they call us machines . or perish . You 're lucky I didn 't kill you . In time you 'll see . It 's not over . I wouldn 't let you out of my sight for one second . and there he is . sit down . Have a drink . or a job . I just need to speak to my girlfriend alone . Mr. Inappropriate ? Excuse me . - What 's going on ? - I 'll tell you outside . Sam . I remember a talk I had with my dad once about tough choices . though . when my dad 's firm was in charge of budget review and accounting for NASA . you join the side that 's going to win . Move . Too direct ? Or is it just me ? sir . You 're mine ! No ! I can 't get out ! - Someone get help ! - Good night ! Mr. Dylan . Get me out of here ! Help ! Get help ! - He 's young . He will learn . Good night . - Get me out ! It was a fun night . You really think you 're the first man ever asked to join the noble alien cause ? Who are you ? Do you know why we 've not been back to the moon since 1972 ? they came to my dad and they told him to do some creative accounting . he and the others shut down the American and Russian space programs . And they 've been our clients ever since . - You helped them kill people ? - You think they 'd give you a choice ? it 's not like I personally participated . I am a liaison . I liaise . Sam . Sam ! - Sam ! - Let her go ! Sam ! Sam . You 're the one spy I 've never been able to provide as someone close to the Autobots . Sam ! Don 't do what he wants ! he will . They all do . you understand me ? they 'll do it to her and they 'll do it to me . So you show a little respect when someone offers you a job ! Wrist . and you will ask one question . everything ! doesn 't it ? It 's very high-tech . hear what you hear and it taps your nervous system . if you so much as try and signal ... Sam . Relationships have consequences . I am here because of my father . She is here because of you . stop ! Stop ! Stop ! would you please ? do your job . She 'll be safe . I give you my word . I 'll kill you . You have my word . Combatant Commands are now at DEFCON 1 . Approximately 200 Decepticons are now in hiding . Energon detectors have been triggered as far away as South America and China . The U. N. Just received an encrypted audio file . They say it 's from the leader of the Autobots . Defenders of Earth . We have come for your natural resources to rebuild our damaged planet . we will leave your world in peace . you must immediately exile the Autobot rebels you have harbored . Nonnegotiable . Renounce the rebels . We await your reply . We 'll debrief you in transit . I really don 't see how I can be of any help . you guys seem pretty busy . I think . I have underestimated you at every turn . What ? You warned us that they were using humans . And you knew that Sentinel was the key . Director ! you 're the expert . I 'm just a walking security risk . Are you all right ? Yes . you 're not . You 're sweating . - I 'm fine . I 'm fine . I 'm sweating because I 'm nervous . I 'm nervous because you got me in here with this information . I 'm a Twitter junkie . I blog everything . - I can 't keep a secret to save my life . - You wouldn 't dare . the Pentagon 's calling in 15 . - What are you doing ? - Nothing . What are you doing ? Get away from me . It 's been a remarkable series of events today at the Capitol . legislation was passed to exile the Autobots from American shores . The U. S. Military alliance with them is officially over . - " We cannot in good conscience ... . " - Okay . What ? They can 't do this . people . These are our allies . The Autobots fought for us . They fought with us . And where are we now ? Facing an enemy invasion with an enemy that has the means to deploy countless more . now is the time to tell . Autobots have no way of leaving this planet . And that is where you 're wrong . Its name is the Xanthium . It brought the second wave of Autobots and it 's been under NASA ' s care and study ever since . We linked it with a decommissioned shuttle to maintain military control until they 're gone . not 19 ! You 're gonna risk the lives of all me mates ! I 'll ball you ! These guys are the Wreck ers . They take care of the Xanthium . 'cause they 're assholes . ya nancy swanker ! It 's time to kill him ! you know . Just doing my job . Just calm down . Leave him alone . This is a human being . - Epps ! - You are ridiculous ! man ? What are you doing here ? I retired from the Air Force . Can you let my hand go ? What the hell was that ? Now I just consult to run interference for them . you 're not helping ! No more combat and aliens shooting at my ass . I got a dream job . Time to get off this planet . Kicking the Autobots out . Can you believe this is happening ? - Where do you think it 's taking them ? - Any planet but here . I wanna talk to whoever 's in charge here ! well . Charlotte Mearing . Agent Simmons . Former Agent Simmons . So I see you survived Washington . heartbreak . I survive . I will survive . kid . Putting all the intel on the table . And if you think deporting nine Autobots is gonna solve a damn thing ... It 's out of my hands . Moving up in the world ? Your booty looks excellent . If you ever say a word to anyone I 'll cut your heart out . You already did . listen to me . Don 't let them exile us . Sam . - It 's a Decepticon trap . Check the nitrogen levels . We 're booking out of here . Optimus ? What your leaders say is true . This was all my fault . I told them whom to trust . I was so wrong . That doesn 't make it your fault . It just makes you human for a change . Remember this . but never in yourselves . I need to know how you 're gonna fight back . I know you 're coming back something . I know there 's a plan . You can tell me . No other human will ever know . There is no plan . how are we gonna live with ourselves ? Sam . You always will be . But your leaders have spoken . the fight will be your own . Make it short . We 're loading up . hustle up ! We 're launching at dawn . We 're gonna do whatever we can . Make it like it was . Sam . I gotta be going on . Where were you when they took over the planet ? We just stood by and watched . You should really look at this as a partnership . You have to stand on the side of progress if you wanna be a part of history . zero . Go ahead and throttle up . You wanted an answer . You got one . Sam . We just needed to be sure . Sure of what ? That they would go without a fight . - Say again . - Tracking an incoming object . We all work for the Decepticons now . I need your help to track a phone call . There 's a man on this phone . He 's the head of their human operations and he has Carly hostage . I want you to sit down . Don 't move . Follow me . I 'm watching him drive up right now . The call was placed en route . I 'm hacking into the phone 's camera now . that 's it . That 's a live stream from the camera . Someplace ... Hold on . I can triangulate this . I 've got it . Chicago . Lower penthouse . We 're on . - I 'm going . - You sure ? and I can be there in 15 hours . You 're not going alone . I still got my NEST friends out there . we 're gonna bring this guy in . Why are you helping me ? too . to rebuild their planet . but really one resource in particular . One unique to our planet . Us ? You 're very smart . they can 't rebuild without a slave labor force . How many rocks up there in the universe offer six billion workers ? What are you talking about ? We can 't transport people . They 're not shipping people . They 're shipping their planet here . my God . What 's Sentinel doing here ? Watch . They 're spreading hundreds of pillars around the globe right now . they 're gonna launch them into orbit and bring Cybertron into our atmosphere . The red one there controls the rest . it starts the whole thing . insect operative . Your work is done . Your Excellency . He 's such a dick . - You want this to happen ? - I want to survive . I want 40 more years . You think I asked for this ? I inherited a client . I guess they 'll still need a human leader . you listen to me . It is time for the slaves of Earth to recognize their masters . Seal off the city . Get the dogs outta here now ! Get them in the back ! did they ? You think I 'm at every meeting ? I 'm safe . They said I was safe . Let 's roll ! We had a signal earlier . It 's not working . This is a national emergency broadcast . Chicago has suffered a massive attack . Wrong way ! Get out of here ! Go back ! There is a ring of alien ships around Chicago . Our high-range bombers were just knocked out of the sky . They can ' t get through enemy air defenses over the city . Our satellites have been jammed . We have no way to monitor the enemy 's movement . Our old NEST teams are on stand-down holding at Grissom Air Force Base . We 're about 10 minutes from the battle zone . and infantry is staging at the perimeter . it just doesn 't make sense ! Can 't we get any eyes in there at all ? They keep shooting down our drones . They want us blind . But we do have a couple of mini-drones we 're gonna try . can we try to redirect them toward Trump Tower ? was on his way to Chicago . Said some point-man human op is there for the Decepticons ! that kid is an alien-bad-news magnet . My God . We came here to find her in the middle of all that ? Epps ? I 'm not going in there . No one 's going in . I am . I 'll find her . Sam . Is that what you want ? Is that what you want ? You came all the way out here to get yourself killed ? Huh ? Listen to what I 'm saying . She 's here because of me . Do you understand ? there 's no way you 're gonna be able to reach her ! What do you suggest I do ? It 's over . but it 's over . No . Incoming ! We will kill them all . kill him ! This is going to hurt ! A lot ! Your leaders will now understand . Decepticons will never leave your planet alone . And we needed them to believe we had gone . we take the battle to them ! - I saw your ship blow up ! - The ship ? didn 't we ? We were hidden in the first booster rocket to separate . just as planned . We ain 't going nowhere . no one 's exiling us . The Autobots are staying right here . We 're gonna help you win this war . They 're surrounding the city to make a fortress so that no one can see what they 're up to inside . Our only chance is the element of surprise . I think I know where to look ! Mini-drone is on approach to Trump Tower . You 're telling me Sam 's headed into that ? Poor kid . Probably never got close . right ? What is that ... What is that ? What is that ? So-so ? So you so-so can fly this . That feels terrible . We 're right behind you . we 're going in ! The city is secure . The humans cannot stop us . the rest of the pillars will reach their launch position . where we rebuild Cybertron together ! I have deigned to work with you that our planet may survive ! I will never work for you ! You would be wise to remember the difference . I 'm so sick of this . I 'm just sick of waiting . Where is she ? Where is she ? You 've got some balls . Sam ! no ! Carly ! Carly ! Jump ! fire ! Bee ! Autobots ! They 're alive ! defend the pillar ! Raise the bridges ! Find them ! Sam . You found me . I 'd follow you anywhere . let 's go ! you 're crazy . What is that ? Is that us ? check and see if it 's still working . it 's still got power . do you copy ? Can ... Can you rotate ? Can you do something ? I think we got something . Epps ! We got Epps ! work ! Work ! turn the volume up on that ! The kid ! Can you rotate or something ? okay . They can see us . do you understand ? - Can you hear us ? You understand ? - Witwicky . Please listen . Sentinel Prime is here and he has the pillars to his space bridge . They 're on top of a building on Chicago River . It 's owned by Hotchkiss Gould Investments . the pillar that controls everything is in the southeast cupola . You 've got to destroy the pillar .

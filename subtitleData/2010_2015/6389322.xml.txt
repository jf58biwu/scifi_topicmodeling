Dad ? What ? Can I live with you from now on ? What 's wrong with your mother ? Will you help her or not ? Can I take that thing out of your lip ? I 'll get my things tomorrow .

Is this a dream ? No . It 's something else . You gotta feel in dreams . You can only imagine . Can you feel me ? This is not you . This is you . I can feel you . Hold on . I 'm glad you made it . - Thank you . - Yeah . No problem . What did you think ? It was interesting . Yes , it is . And what are you doing now ? I don 't know . I hadn 't really thought about it . Why ? Are you sure you want to know ? Ok , I 'll tell you . We 're having a party . I took the key from the hotel I work at . Isn 't that illegal ? No it 's fine , they won 't even know we 're there . Ethan , come on , we 're leaving . You should go . Come on . It 'll be fun . Hey , everybody . Ethan ? Are you Ok ? Yeah , I 'm fine . I 've discovered something about you , Ethan . You are a compulsive liar . You should smile more often . What ? What 's so funny ? You 're not the first person who 's told me that . Well , if I may plead my case , Mr. Ethan . A life ... is not worth living if ... you don 't ... have something to smile about . Well , you might not be yourself , then . Well , actually , I am a figment of your imagination . Really ? That 's interesting . I would think if I ... made up , then , you 'd be taller . with a short skirt . It 's a shame I 'm real . No , it 's not . Hey . What 's up ? Wake up ! Wake up ! Wake up ! Where are all the boxes that were in that room ? I moved them . Where ? There 's something wrong with me . Why do you think that is ? You stopped taking your pills . Look at me . What ? These are important . I forgot ! You can forget a lot of things , Ethan . but don 't forget these . Since when do you really care ? Ethan , stop , you 're still my son . I 'm still - This is not about these fucking pills ! You know something ! And you 've gone to extensive links to make sure that I don 't find out about it . I can 't take it anymore ! You told everyone I know never to speak about Adam ? I ... I know this has something to do with the fact that I was in the hospital . And you 're the only one who can tell me about that . Aren 't you ? They day your brother killed himself , something happened to you , as well . Something ? You 're a fucking neurosurgeon , something doesn 't cut it . If you want me to tell you , I would suggest you lower your voice . Sit down . When you saw him , when you Saw Adam , an artery ruptured in your brain . And the lack of oxygen damaged some areas that are necessary for you to properly recall your memories . You blocked out your brother and everything having to do with him . So in essence you forgot . I need you to know that I was trying to help you , Ethan . I thought it was best if those things stayed forgotten . and I tried to keep it that way . Ethan . You blamed yourself for what happened . Do you know what predetermination is ? Like fate ? No . What do you mean ? There 's a difference . If you believe in fate , then all the choices you make both right and wrong , are not yours . You think that they are , but ... they happen that way because they have to . Love ? What do you believe ? I 'd like to believe I 'm in control of my own life . Although lately it doesn 't feel that way . There are things in place . But it 's my decision ... to be here . That 's predetermination . Ethan ... look at me . I don 't ... know why you ... worry about these things you can 't control . Like ... your past , your family , your friends . Thank you . I like it . I 'm so sorry . No . Ally , Ally , whoa whoa . Come on . Come on . Come on . Let 's go back . - Alisson ! - Just leave me alone ! Do you need help ? Promise me Ok . I promise . I promise , baby . I 'll see you in rehab . Come on . I love you . Come on . Excuse me ! Um , will you take our picture ? Say I 'm beautiful . I love fireworks . My body . It hurts . What are you doing here ? Can you ... take a look at something for us ? I was hoping you might be able to tell me where you got it . This isn 't my room . They 're not in the right place . Hello , Ethan . How 'd you know my name ? Everyone knows your name . Who are you ? My name is Dr. Milo Sofley I used to work with your father . I 'm filing a lawsuit against him . I 'm assuming he hasn 't told you why . No . What would you say if I told you I knew what was happening to you ? People cope with traumatic events differently . Some are worse than others . What happened to her ? This isn 't about her , Ethan . This is about you . How much do you know ? I know this is where my dad works . We 're nowhere near your father now , Ethan . Or anyone else . We 're in a room in my house . Then what 's happening to me ? Why am I seeing what I 'm seeing ? You are something , Ethan . You really are . And I think it 's very admirable of you . Trying to find yourself in such a way . Ethan , you 're asking the wrong questions . You saw the x-rays . What 'd you think that was ? I don 't know . It 's a microcomputer . A silicon hippo campus chip . We all have memories which we prefer to forget . Your father never told you what he was doing because he wasn 't sure that it would work . To be honest , I think you were in no position to argue with him . The next thing you knew , you awoke in a hospital , unaware of any pf this . Ethan , ever since your surgery , You 've been combining your past and your present , to create your own happiness . Your condition , Ethan , causes you to think your dreams are real life . It stopped working ? Because I remembered my brother . No , Ethan . You don 't have a brother . It was you . I need you to come back to the real world , Ethan . I need you to trust me . This is your house . Yes , it 's where we 've been the whole time . Do you understand everything that I 'm telling you , Ethan ? This chip works as an artificial part of your brain Because it was damaged , everything that you now remember is directly connected to the hippo campus chip . You are dependent on it For normal functioning . I don 't know what to believe . Why are you helping me ? Ethan ! - Ethan ! - What ? What do you want from me ? We have a case , Ethan ! You can 't fight back ! Here . I know everything . Ethan ... It 's over . Ethan , I 'm ... really not in the mood right now , can we just ... - I don 't care ! I have something to say . And you 're gonna listen . Let go of my hand . Why ? Let go of my hand ! Why should I listen to anything you have to say ? I haven 't been in control of my life in a long time , and I have you to thank for that . This is ridic - it 's late ! Get out of my room . I wanted to let you know it 's not working . It stopped working . Ethan ... - I don 't think you understand this ... - I had a talk with Milo Sofley this afternoon ... Do you know him ? Don 't you ? What did he tell you ? I know what you did . I know everything . I gave you ... a chance to s ... - No ! What you gave me was ... a life that wasn 't my own ! I don 't want that ! You 've insulted me . I want you to take it out . - Well , I don 't think you ... - if there 's one thing ... I will ever ask of you , This is it . I 'm not broken . You cannot fix whatever it is you think is wrong with me , I am who I am . Ethan ... This chip is a major part of your cognitive functioning . If I remove it , it 'll be as if we never had this conversation . You will not remember any of this . - You don 't know that . - Yes , I do ! It is your hippo campus . It tells your memories where to go and how they will be remembered Without it ... Ethan ... Please , please , please , for the love of God . Do not make this decision . Despite me . I 've been there before . Haven 't I ? If I don 't remember any of this , then that 's my decision . Ethan , please , please , please . If you won 't do it , I 'll call Milo . Ok . I 'll do it . I 'll do it . Do you remember what you said when you gave this to me ? No . You said that it reminded you of me . Because I was always happy . And now the blue bird reminds me of you . Wish I had ... more things that I could remember that were happier . Truthfully you 've been upset for so long , I can 't remember a time when we were happy . But that 's why we 're here . I felt angry ... when you drank , but I still love you . I felt hurt ... and lonely ... when you tried to h - when you tried to hurt yourself . But I still love you . I felt upset , I felt ashamed , when Ally told me how she found you , But I still love you . I hate it when you lie . But I st ... I still love you . Lucas ! Baby , I 'm so glad you 're home ! It 's good to be home . I missed you so much . It 's good to see you . Hey man , welcome home . Ah , thanks ! It 's good to see you , man . It 's good to be home . I 'm glad you 're back . - Yeah , me , too . Thanks . Let 's go back inside , alright ? You coming ? I think I 'm going to stay out here for a little while . Can you see me ? Can you see your son ? You promised me ! You promised ! Milo , tell him what happened . Ethan , please , please . Just calm down . Truth ... is in fact the most important piece of information in any event with such discrepancies as the ones we 've been faced with here . The brain is the most powerful ... and fragile part of the human body . But in this case , it 's the object in question . Mr. Ethan Galloway will further undergo a series of BCI tests , which record the exact radioactivity that his brain emits . This tests do not confabulate . And they will be done before and after the removal of the hippo campus chip . He 's the son of Charles Galloway whose wishes will be granted . No matter how serious the consequences . This is it . You have to be sure that this is really what you want before you take this pill . After this , there 's no turning back . Ethan ! You know I won 't remember any of this . Yes you will .

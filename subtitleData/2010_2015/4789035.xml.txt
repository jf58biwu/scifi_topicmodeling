 THE BOMBING A HATECRIME AGAINST HUBOTS - Aren 't you going to work ? - Well , yes ... Don 't you sleep ? When I woke up in the night , you were up . I was watching TV . All night ? No , I turned in later , on the couch . I didn 't sleep either , and the telly was on all night . - Yes , you slept . - I did ? - I tucked you in . - You did ? - You slept very well . - Okay . When I woke up , the bathroom was busy . Until now . I had to use the garden . - I was using it . - For hours ? - I just left my " husband " . - Yes , I know ... But ... - What has that got to do with this ? - Maybe you worry about the bombing . I think about it alot . And Kevin . I 'm not really myself . And it 's just the same for me . REAL HUMANS Shit ! Mange . ( Nick for Magnus ) Are you horny ? She looks fucking horny . You want to cuddle ? Hold her . Give us some kiss lips . - Come on , go for it . Do it yourself . - Feel her breast . What the fuck was that ? Fag ! Hold it ! Rick ? We 've been getting by on my savings for awhile . But now I have to start working . And I 've got a job ! Pilar got me a position at her gym . - Honey , aren 't you happy ? - Yes ... For what ? - I 've got a job . - Yes ... Really . Maybe you can come with me to work . I can be by myself . At home . - What would you do ? - Go to the mall and look . - You go there for a purpose . - Charge in the slot charger ? I think you should come to the gym with me . Bo often does it with Pilar . How nice . We 're out of milk . I 'll go and buy some . Fuck , he 's doing it ! - Stop it . - Come on ! - Take it easy ! Guys , let 's split . Come on , let 's go ! Anita ... Hello , Tobias . Hello . My name is Inger Engman , I will be your defense attorney . - Everything we say is confidential . - We 're being monitored . Yes , I suppose we are . You specifically requested me . It 's never happened to me before , so I 'm a bit curious . Well , that 's your business . You are accused of two murders . They have your fingerprints on the scene and in the escape vehicle . That 's pretty damaging technical evidence in a trial . You risk a conviction . What we 're dealing with is very serious , so it would be nice if you spoke up . I can 't speak as long as we 're being monitored . They can tape the inquiry , but first , I need to talk to you . Just you and me . Okay . I 'll see ... I 'll see what I can do . Give me your old clothes . - Hello . - Hey , it 's Kevin . Just so you know , if you tell anyone about today , you 're dead . Hello ? Hello ? - Is Anita here ? - Yes . She was supposed to pick Sofia up at the day-care . Something has happened . Sofia , why don 't you go and unpack your bag ? Well , what ? I came back from school and someone must have been on her , so I helped ... - " Been on her " ? - I don 't know . She 's in one piece . - Why didn 't you call me ? - Didn 't think ... No harm done , just ... - Just ? - Nothing ... - Anita , how are you ? - I 'm fine . What happened today ? Four boys prevented me from picking Sofia up . And I 'm sorry about that . What did they do ? They prevented me from getting Sofia . I think it was a prank . - Can I talk to Tobbe in private ? - Of course . " A prank " ? Did you see what happened ? I saw some guys running , then I found Anita , but there are those that deride hubots . - This is a police matter . - But nothing happened . - You saw who it was ? - Some young punks . - And she 's not broken ? - No . - I will report this . - Daddy ! Coming ! - She 's okay , what will the police do ? - We 'll see . Take the groceries , please . I guess I 'm here to build a confidence , to make him cooperate . This falls under exemption provisions . Even so , he has the right to know if he 's being monitored . The situation is both special and very serious . He 's charged with two murders and the bombing . - And I 'd say the evidence are poor . - Oh ? You have his dentals , fingerprints , DNA , every scar has been photographed . But he has a mark , a tattoo on his arm . And that 's not even registered in his description . You 've been given what 's essential to the criminal investigation . I 'm not stupid . I know there 's something you 're not telling me . If you don 't want to cooperate , just say so . He chose me as his counsel , so now I expect you to let me know when I can talk to him without being monitored . He specifically requested her . He must have some reason . Oh , can I have the scraps ? I don 't have any money . - Where 's your owner ? - I don 't have an owner . Do you want to come to the bathroom with me ? I don 't date hubots ... Did he say that , Pilar ? Wait ... So it 's here ? - I was about to ask you to buy some . - Oh ... - Have you been outside ? - No ... - Oh . I thought ... Oh , well ... - It 's okay . You were saying ? Exactly ... - Right ... - If I had any say in it ... - Because of my attitude towards hubots ? - No , I fought for you , but there 's new management . We 're not profitable . The times are rough , so we do as everyone else , or we all go . - And Jorge ? - Jorge . This is the first measure , and there may be more . Answer the question , will you keep Jorge ? You have both been let go . But Jorge will be rehired . - I 've been here 7 years longer than him . - You get 12 months severance pay . - What the fuck ... - And that 's generous , Roger . But it 's dependent on the condition that you work a few weeks more , and let - - Iago , here , work beside you , so he 'll learn your tasks . Hello , Roger . Is there a purpose to walk this slow ? - Walk as you please , this is my pace . - So it 's an individual choice ? Maybe , for me ... Tell me the purpose of what you 're doing . I collect the order sheets and check that everything 's ticked off by the packers . May I try ? No , I want to take them from the holder , like you did . Go ahead . There 's a tick missing here , didn 't you see that ? Of course I did . - What do you do if an item isn 't ticked ? - Guess ... I check the stock balance , the packer may have made a mistake . Then I notify the packer so it won 't happen again . - That 's right . - Where are we going now ? - I 'm going for a coffee , you stay here . Stand right there , when I get back . - What 's the purpose of ... - The purpose is that I said so . After breakfast we 'll go for a 30 minute walk , then you rest an hour . A light lunch , then another short walk . Let it ring , Lennart . Lennart , no ! - Hello ? - Guess who it is . Solveig . Lennart , deux points . What would you say about having dinner with me tonight ? Yes ... Your place or mine , handsome ? Eh , maybe ... - At your place , gorgeous . - No ... My place is a mess , can we be at your place ? - Yes , but ... - You know what ? Why don 't we shop and make dinner , it was ages ago I did that . - I have to run . Kiss . - Kiss ? Kiss ! - Roger . - Mm . Played any golf ? - No ... - It 's so obsessive . Dammit ... We were supposed to work 20 minutes ago . - Didn 't I tell you to wait ? - The coffee break is five minutes . So ? If you won 't come and continue to teach me your job , I will let Maria know . I 'm a little late ... - ... and you will tell Maria ? - That 's the procedure . - You think so ? - I know so . Your kind end up disliked , does that bother you ? Maria likes me . Can I try ? - Enough talking , it 's time to work . - You see the spot up there ? - I see many spots . - Look at the big one up there . How does Maria like you now , huh ? How does she like you now ? Fucking puppet ! Hell , Roger ! What are you doing ? How does she like you now ? Well ... I should report this to the police . I take a personal risk if I don 't . But if you leave , and never show up here again , I won 't . Right ... I hope you work on your issues , the world isn 't against you , Roger . It 's you , who 's against the world . I 'm sure you 'll understand , there will be no severance pay . No ... - Are you done ? - We 're done now . I 'm looking for ketchup . Mathilda , honey ! ? - ... round the corner . - Why are you here ? - We have to talk . - The mark on Anita 's arm . - The one I made up and lied about ? You didn 't tell dad or anyone else ? No . Good . Don 't . You were right . Anita isn 't just any hubot . - What does that mean ? - I don 't know. yet . But before I know more , don 't talk to anyone about this . Okay . Two at a time . He may get suspicious if fuses pop . - Where is he ? - At work . - When will he be back ? - Varies from day to day . - How do you connect ? - He 's attracted to me , he thinks I 'm different . - If I force it , I may push him away . - Do you want me to take over ? - You 're joking ? - No . To change object now could be confusing . Okay . If there were two of us ? Wouldn 't that speed up the process ? No . Where is Leo ? Arrested . - We won 't get to him without risk . - Isn 't it a risk by not acting now ? They know that a dead Leo Eischer is of no use to them . How are you ? I think it 's because of Flash . - Bea ? Bea ? Bea ? Bea ! ? - Don 't go down there , it 's a mess . - Yes ... ugh ... I 'll clean it up , until I do , I keep out of there . How was work today ? - I quit . - What ? I quit . I finally did something about it , and quit that fucking hubot farm . I 'll take that . Now I 'll stay at home . Feels great . Spend time with you . I 'll fix the cellar too . Pull her pants down , wimp . Come on , you won 't do anything Shit , he 's doing it ! But honey , she 's in one piece . I don 't know if we should call the police . Absolutely not . From now on , she doesn 't leave the house . If we can 't let her outside , there 's a problem big enough to call the police . No ... Oh ? And why not ? I don 't want that . Maybe this isn 't just about what you want ... I can 't explain it , please just trust me , the police will not be involved in this . - You have to accept that , I 'm sorry . - Right ... - Is Tobbe home ? - Yes , in his room . It 's mom . Yes ... I 'll take care of it , okay ? You 're such a pain ... It 's Tobbe , say your piece after the beep . - Inger , if this is to work ... - Wait , wait ... Hey , Tobias , It 's mom . Can you call me when you get this , we have to talk . Inger , come and watch this . I 'm on my way home now . I have eaten . Yes , whatever , bye . From Anita ! Can I have that coin ? Can I have your coin ? I need food . Here you go . - Hey , what 's up ? What 's the money for ? The slot charger . Let 's see how much more you need . Where 's your owner ? In the store . Hell , you can have power for free in my car . And maybe some new clothes ? Good , come on . It 's cool . Here , the red one . This one ? That 's junk . No , this one . That 's good stuff . There , Lennart . Head for the vegetables ! What 's this ? Why are you coming ? You , wait here ! - You must be allowed to sample . - Are you sure ? Try it ! Hey , wait up ! Let me go ! Tobbe ? Come here . - What ? I have homework . - Mom and I saw a video on your computer . What the hell ! Cameras rolling , do it again with a bit more feel . Stop it , Hans . It 's not funny . - The computer was on and the page up . Tobias , this is some of the worst things I 've seen . How can you say it was a prank by some young guys ? It was before I saw the clip . How did you even know there was a clip ? - This is just getting more weird . You 're coming down on me for this ? Open and I 'll tell you something fun , Kev . I 've got a job , honey ! Can I come in ? Kev ? - What has happened ? - Nothing . You 're all banged up . Let 's see if I got this ... You heard Anita 's voice , you thought it was young guys , but you didn 't see them . And you hid Anita 's clothes because you thought we 'd get mad about that . Yes . What have you been up to now ? Before you got home . I took a walk . Who did it ? You have to tell me . You 've been assaulted . We have to call the police . Shit , if you go on like this , I 'll never tell . I don 't want you to call the police , okay ? But what has ... It was just someone , I don 't know who . A fucking madman . - Wait , wait ... - We 're not calling the police ? They won 't do anything anyway . Why don 't you want me to call the police , Kevin ? What can they do now ? I don 't want a fucking hearing . What do you say ? I don 't know ... I 'm calling the police . It was Kevin . Therese 's Kevin ? Say what you want , I 'm calling the police now . Okay , okay ! It was Tobbe , our old neighbor . Inger 's Tobbe ? Get out ! Get out , and inside ! Hurry up , you bastard ! This shit made her slow and useless . No more of that ! And you , do you have to look as stupid as you are ? Huh ? Why do I do this ? Why do I take care of you ? I 'm so fucking nice . So fucking nice , I deserve prison . I 'm sorry , Silas . You 're sloppy and don 't give a shit about what I 've tought you . - What have I tought you ? You . - Do not leave the store together . That 's right ! Can you get that into your fucking Windows brains ? Never be seen in a group . Never ! You can see a idiot here , another idiot there , but three of them together ... Fuck ! Hello ? Kindly open . My God , it 's been 8 years since she passed . 8 years . It 's something like that for me too . Time rushes by , when you 're alone . Every day is like the next . It rushes by when you 're having fun too . No , it moves even slower ... Have you had that machine as company since you were widowed . No , she ... It 's new . I had another one before that . But , he ... - Tell me . - He broke . I 'm sorry . It 's probably the vine . Now let 's see ! What Solveig has in her bag . Tonight , I think we deserve to get a little drunk , you and I. I don 't know ... Hey ... Now we 'll see what she 's made of , that , whatshername . - Vera . - Vera ? Vera , come ! - I can do that . - No , we 'll put her to work . Yes ? Open . There . - Thank you , you can go . - No , no , no . Pour . Enjoy . Only me ? Pour for us both . You shouldn 't drink more vine , Lennart . It 's not good for you . Shut up and pour . Do as I say . Pour it , Vera . There ... - Thank you . - You 're welcome . Go . - Why don 't you get rid of that bitch ? - She means well . Sometimes you forget that they 're machines . Cheers ! Cheers . For the humans . Let 's try again . What 's your name ? Okay . Your name ! Hey , buddy . Come . Soon finished . Oh . - What are you doing ? - I liberate her , so she can be one of you . You think it 's scary ? It 'll be over soon . - You feel better now ? - It feels good . The recycling station . Haven 't I told about it ? Not for the new ones . Do you know what it is to die ? You get buried . You disappear . You no longer exist . Humans get buried . But you end up at the recycling station . That 's where Kyra is now . They have cut out her eyes , cut her body up and taken the battery out . Opened her skull and removed the brain . Skinned her , melted it to a pulp . Drained her of plasma . She 'll be new hubots now . Without any memory of who they came from . Wait , wait . Know this . One day you won 't be around anymore . You will disappear . And become new hobots . - Only if we get caught . - There will be new models . You get ... You get old , broken , worthless and no one will want you . But me . I 'm not like that . As long as you behave and do as you 're told , you get to stay here . Come on . He 's in love ? In love , not just some ... He 's in love . - So this has been your little secret . - What was I to do ? He was ashamed . - He didn 't want anyone to find out . - And he ends up assaulting Kevin . Not that Kevin is any choir boy ... Should we get rid of her ? Anita ? I think this hubot is more trouble than help right now . It 's a she . I suggest we sell her . Anita . Okay , because she was exploited , she 's the problem . My God , hubots are machines and we 've exploited machines for centuries . Sorry , I heard how that came out , but she 's not human . We 're a kind of machine , too . We marry them , we have sex with them . We fall in love with them . - What 's the difference ? - We have a soul , a heart and emotions . Anita was almost raped by a gang of kids today . God , I 'm tired of this . We copy ourselves and dehumanize them , so that we can exploit them . Regardless , hubots won 't go away , we must learn to live with them . That 's what I 'm saying . I don 't want to get rid of them , or Anita . Just that they should be treated the same . I can 't listen to this anymore . Welcome back . Welcome . Welcome . Sorry . - Hey , you ... - Yes . Did we do it ? I don 't know ... What 's the time ? 10 . What ? God ... Where did I put my clothes ? Get out ! Out ! You have a time to keep ? Yes ... The dog . My little Nisse is all alone . Goodbye . Lover boy . You have my number . Call me . Where 's my bag ... . I threw it away . Your number ! Solveig ! Wait ! Egg and bacon , strong coffee ? Could you two help me with a bench press over here ? Well , guys ... Take the cap off , Kev . - We think you both behaved badly . - Yes . Really badly ... Shake hands and say you 're sorry . Stand up , Kev ! Sorry that I hit you ... so much . Kevin ! Well , sorry if I ... borrowed your ... thing . Do you know her name ? - No ... - Anita . Okay . - A little worse than " borrow " , I think . - We 're going to court now ? You don 't have to be best buddies , but try to be decent to one another . Yes . Kev ! I said I was sorry . I don 't think we get much further here . I 'm glad we got to see each other . Kevin 's 3 here . At the fair . He won that . He was always lucky that way . - You 're bored ? - No . Let me see . - Is that you ? - Yes . Cute . This is Kevin 's soccer team . He was good at it . I was supporting coach . Always there for them . This is ... I 'm sorry . - Never done this with anyone before . - Done what ? Can 't you see that I 'm crying ? I 've never done it with someone before . What 's the worst that happened to you ? - I don 't know . - That 's okay . You don 't have to know stuff all the time . I wish you 'd met my mother , but she died five years ago . - Dad died when I was 15 . - That 's sad . - Are yours alive ? - I don 't have any . - No parents ? - No . - You 're an orphan ? - Yes . - Orphanage ? - No . Some day when I really trust you , I will tell you . - You can trust me . - Some other day . Okay . I don 't have a job , and the next paycheck will be my last . But I 'm not sad . Not even worried . - Do you know why that is ? - No . - You don 't ? - No . - Not even a hunch ? - No . Because you 're here . You 're here . That 's the way it is . Please hold for a second . Excuse me , I have a meeting with a client and I 'm running a bit late . The case is closed . - Excuse me ? - The case was closed today . It 's not closed , what are you talking about ? I 'm sorry , you will not be admitted , there 's no appointment and the case is closed . - Crap game ... - I agree . Nothing to write home about . Ove ! - See you . - Yeah , bye . - What 's happening ? - With ? My client . Should have told you . He 's in observation . - The case is closed ? - I 'm afraid so . - It can 't be closed . - Get in the car . Well ? He may be put to death , in order to do an autopsy . They can 't do this . You 're sworn to secrecy . This is what will happen . And the murder investigation ? The victim 's next of kin ? - People have the right to know ! - Not this time . The investigation is ongoing , just without a suspect anymore . - When will they murder him ? - In that case , tomorrow morning . I will not let this go . If they kill him , I will cause a racket ! - Hey . - Hey . Sorry if I went ballistic the other day . It 's cool . Is Bea here ? Yes . Great . Great that you two ... Really . Well , I won 't bother you ... Just wanted ... to return your keys . I left a few things in the basement . It was left when I made the bomb . Is it okay , if I ... get it ? - Yeah , sure . - Cool .

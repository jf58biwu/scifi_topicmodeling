 ZONE : We need to get out of the city . No tech . No printing . GRIFF : Look , we decided . We go underground , deep as we can . Who are you ? - I don 't know . - She 's a dumb show . This is the way to Safe Haven . The chair . The memories will tell us how to get there ? Home sweet home . I need Topher to put me in the chair . Back me up on a drive . Hardcopy . - You 're copying yourself ? - In case something happens to me . I know exactly where we 're going . - MAG : Caroline ? - Yeah . MAG : Butchers are coming . I hope we find me alive . ( MAN SCREAMING ) ( PEOPLE SHOUTING ) Butchers ! Butchers ! Come on ! Move , move , move ! Go , go , go ! How are there butchers all the way up here ? - We 're nowhere near a city . - Locals . Got hit with a blanket signal . CAROLINE : They were wearing suits . Yes . This was your finer class of mindless kill zombie . Maybe they were on a corporate retreat . Who cares ? We still need water and we 're low on gas . If we don 't get to Safe Haven soon ... Caroline , we 've been dodging the mobs for weeks . - Are you sure we 're on the right track ? - I think so . I don 't know . Last time I was up here it wasn 't this bad . I could see over the dash . - Whose body was this ? - We don 't know . She was printed before we met her . Stuck your brain in her because you 're supposed to be the great and terrible Caroline . The one who knows how to save us . The tech works . In my camp in Safe Haven , no one 's been imprinted since we set up . We still have a chance to make a true world . A true world ? Look around , tiny messiah . It 's over . Half the world 's been wiped . The rest have turned into crazies trying to kill the other half . There 's only a handful of Actuals left , which you , by the way , ain 't . We are lost . We are not gone . Is it gonna be weird for you to meet yourself ? - Face to your real face ? - No , it 'll be sweet . You were one of those magically delicious super whores . - I bet you looked great . - Lf I have to kick your ass again ... Yeah . Let me see your ugly mug ... ( GROANING ) All right , that 's enough . Let 's not bruise the merchandise . Bring out the others . - Where are we ? - Neuropolis . The city of minds . - MAG : Neuropolis exists ? - Wait , what ? It used to be Tucson . Rossum was run from here . And you just didn 't think to mention that Safe Haven was parked right next door to the fricking Death Star ? It had to be . This is where we got the vaccine . We were raiding it for tech whenever we could . You were here before ? So , what are they gonna do with us ? Yeah . - Mr. Harding . - What is it now ? I 'm eating . - Of course you are , sir . - Watch it . You said you wanted a new suit . We have a few for you to choose from . Oh . Well , it 's about time . ( GRUNTING ) I can 't believe I let this one get so stretched out . You 'd be just as fat , Ambrose , if we hadn 't run out of shellfish . AMBROSE : True , but we 're having a hard time finding acceptable replacement bodies in the chaos out there . We gotta start taking better care of ourselves . You 're right . This time I will . Gonna start on the elliptical . Where did this body come from ? He 's a dumb show . - Poachers caught him in the wild . - Was he with anyone ? - Just some girl . - You idiot . What 's the matter with him ? A couple of dumb shows never hurt anybody . This is worse than butchers by at least a lot . - It 'll be okay . - Wait , you got a plan , wunderkind ? I guess I do . - Echo . - Still living the dream , Harding ? It is a little bit tarnished . Did you ever think if you didn 't cut off Rossum at the head , the tech might never have gotten out of control ? Yeah , you 're a model of control , butterball . At least I 'm having some fun . ( COCKING GUN ) Please . You know I 'm backed up . - Why do you bother anymore ? - Ask me again sometime . - Does anyone need medical ? - ( SOFTLY ) Paul . - MAG : Over here . - You do your doctor thing . I 'll find him . She 's lost a lot of blood . She 's in hypovolemic shock . The brachial artery , it 's healed up , but we need to find oxygen . Or an IV . Supplement the remaining blood supply . Here . Let me give you a hand . - Where 'd you learn that trick ? - The same place you did . - Topher . - No ! No , no , no ! I mean , yes . Yes , yes . I 've been working . I 've been working . Hard at working . Please don 't use a bullet . - Don 't want to waste . - It 's Paul . I 'm here with Echo . - Echo ? - Yes . One bullet a day . Don 't want to waste . One person down a day until I solve the problem . They shoot someone if you don 't invent what they want ? What they need . Every day . A chain reaction . Erase the world all at once . How is he ? He 's pretty far gone . - The prisoners ? - One of them is me . Okay . I think Harding was making him build something to wipe the whole planet . I solve the problem , but people die if I do or I don 't . - A new problem . Chain reaction . - Hey , Topher . It 's me . - We 're getting you out of here . - I 'm so close . So close . So close to solving both problems . They would have no idea . Close to what ? Wiping everyone ? The opposite . Reflection . Like an echo . Put things back the way they were . Minds back the way they were . I can bring back the world . Hey , T. Come and look at this . - I told you it 'd be worth the wait . - Awesome . - Do you want to go show your mom ? - Yeah . Gently . Go . Hey , Mom . Hey , Mom . - Look , the strawberries are ripe . - Oh , wow . Those look amazing . Try one . Go ahead . You can trust your mom . Let 's save the rest for dessert , huh ? Come here . Are these from the East House ? Hill House . They need help finishing the well in the next few days . Clearly . If this is all they 're producing . Echo . PAUL : Topher collapsed about a half-mile back . He 's malnourished , needs water . Go . Topher ? We got him . They were trying to get Topher to build a pulse bomb , send out some kind of chain-reacting blanket signal . Wipe everyone . Everyone in the world ? Who 's left ? - We came out of LA . - I 'm amazed you survived . Well , hold your applause . There were 30 of us when we banded . - Who 's worth wiping anymore ? - ECHO : Maybe a group overseas . Maybe us . Maybe they 're getting tired of me killing them all the time . - Aren 't you ? - Thanks for the insight , mini me . But you missed the last quarter of this game . We 're not ahead . The point is , Topher thinks he can flip it . Create a pulse to restore all the wiped minds . Yeah ? He also thinks he 's a little teapot , short and stout . Topher Brink is a genius , and you will keep a civil tongue in this house or we 'll put it in the stew . - Good to see you 've mellowed . - What did they do to him ? They shot someone in front of him every day he didn 't finish . - We don 't really eat people 's tongues . - Cool . I 've got a rocket scientist or two in here . They 're not Topher 's league , but I don 't think it 's a fantasy . - The science seems sound . - PRIYA : Well , what would it mean ? Butchers , dumb shows , everyone who 's ever been wiped or imprinted - would go back to their original identities . - Including us ? - Would go back to their original identities . - Including us ? ( ZONE EX CLAIMS ) You 'd finally get to be a real girl . - It sounds so simple . - ECHO : It 's not . Anyone with Active architecture , we 'd be reset , too . Back before it all started . - We 'd forget ... - Everything . ECHO : Some of us can afford that , but a lot of us can 't , and Topher doesn 't have everything he needs . - This is where it gets interesting . - It was dull ? To avoid the blast and any reverberation , we 'd have to go deep underground for a year or more . And what Topher needs to make the pulse work ... Is in the Dollhouse . - Come on ! - I guess there really is no place like home . Hey , hey . We just left that party . That party was on fire . ECHO : We need a guide . And you two know the city better than any of us . I thought there was a vaccine . You said there was a vaccine ! There was , but this is new . Zone , power down a sec . Think about what this means . It means everything , and somebody 's gotta step up . The world still needs heroes , kid . ( ALL LAUGHING ) - Did you really just say that ? - What ? I was being inspirational . - You are so corny . - You 're fat . Enough with the pep talk . We need to get back . - You 're going to show us the way or ... - She said you don 't eat tongues . Maybe she should start . I have listened to you whine for way too long , Zone . - This is bigger than us . - Fine . Then you take them . You can send me a postcard once we 've reestablished some sort of postal system due to your heroics . She loves it when you 're corny . ZONE : Look , for your 411 , I 'm not some printed freak . And the pulse ? It doesn 't affect Actuals , right ? So I 'm not heading back into ... ( LOW RUMBLING ) What 's that sound ? PRIYA : I thought you said you weren 't followed . - It 's the main gate . - PAUL : Raiding party . PRIYA : T , come here right now . ( SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ) ( WHIRRING ) Sorry . English . I got your message . How can we help ? Sorry if you don 't like our methods . We like to take the offensive . - Most people have a shoot-first policy . - PAUL : Us included . Romeo , you want to help with this or do you want to play in the sandbox ? PRIYA : But why him ? I sent word with some of the Actuals we set free . - It was a long shot . - He 's out of control . They 're freak shows . Tech heads . Exactly the sort of thing I 'm trying to keep T away from . They 're our only chance of making it back through the wild . But I don 't want to go back . I don 't want to leave our home . Go down that hole . It 's not my idea of a vacation spot either . It 's just the next thing . Do I have to cut your throat ? What are you doing with the boy ? - Showing him my mods , Vic . - No ! No tech in front of the kid . Do I have to upload that to your brain myself ? I got it . Log off . Easy . You know , you can stay . - I 'll do the job . - Come on . It just takes me a while to process things , during which I yell . I get what 's at stake . Who doesn 't want to spend some quality time with these awesomely-normal people ? I don 't know . It could be all right . Little Asian 's kind of cute . She 's a tech head , Mag . She 's a girl , Mag . - It 's good to see him productive again . - It is . - Yes . And who are you ? - I 'm Carol ... I 'm in the ... I 'm just some kid . ( LOUD CLICK ) Damn , you 're twitchy . You don 't like girls ? Apparently everyone does . I don 't care for the tech . So you 're the weapons expert ? That ... That 's what that says , yeah . So , what , you gotta load that every time ? You can 't just store it ? Not unless you 're Echo . We want to stay sane , we gotta take something out first , make room for it . Take out what ? ( CHUCKLING ) That 's great . - How long have we been on the road ? - A couple of hours . - How 's the kid doing ? - You can call him T. He sleeps better than I do , that 's for sure . The garden , it looks like it came a long way since I last saw it . Three summers ago ? We 've had some time to get it right . I just mean ... - I understand it would be hard to leave . - It was our home , away from all the horror . Now I 'm condemning him to that house , that hell I was locked up in for so many years . So you can remember him . Remember raising him . How ironic . You 'd have to kill me to take those memories . I wanted him brought up away from all the crap in the back of this truck . You and me both did . That 's why we agreed never to tell him . Keep him away from me . We agreed to keep him away from the tech . - Here we go . - You chose to stay steeped in it , Tony . Seduced by it . You chose to be Victor . - For our cause . - For your cause . - I stopped fighting long ago . - I was fighting to protect you . I would do anything for you . For both of you . Except the one thing I asked you to do . Man , you 're gonna be hilarious stuck underground for a year . - We 're not there yet . - We 'll get there . This thing works , Rossum is really going down . Ambrose , Harding , they 'll just be hard drives on a shelf . Someone 's gonna have to smash those drives . Which is why we 're staying down until we know we 're safe . - You keep bringing that up . - Because you keep pushing it down . You think after the pulse the world 's gonna be all hunky-dory ? I think it 's not your fight . I think , for a good long while , you 're gonna have to be where you are , and I think that scares you . ( GROANING ) I hate when you pretend to know me . It 's not a claim I make . I 've been knocking 10 years . You still won 't let me in . I 've let you in a few times . When you were sure we were gonna die . What happens if you 're sure we 're gonna live ? What do you think happens ? No , no . Come on . You 're my analyst now . So , tell me , what do you think ? I think you 've got 100 people living inside your head , and you 're the loneliest person I know . - That 's kind of sweet . - Not for the person who 's with you . ECHO : We 're gonna enter here through the Union Plaza metro station , the service tunnels . The butchers have killed most everyone in the city and run out of food , - so they 're thinning out . - No , they got food . We saw one eating his friend the other day . Ew . - But it still means there 's less of them . - It also means the strongest survived . Super butchers . Grand . VICTOR : We 're almost there . I 'll get us as close as I can . I thought you said there weren 't many left . There aren 't . But they 're all here . Ready ? We were born ready . Well , not technically . Yankee ! ( ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ) ECHO : Paul , let 's go . Move them out . Move ! They 're armed ! All up . We got them underground . VICTOR : Move it ! Move it ! Everyone into the tunnel now ! Go , go , go ! ( SCREAMING ) Hey , hey , hey . It 's okay . You 're gonna be ... Zone ! That 's all of us . Seal the door behind us . - What about ... - That 's all of us . We go down here . Wait . Last time we were here , your zombie day spa was crawling with butchers . We need to drop some C4 down the rabbit hole . ADELLE : Then you risk destroying the tech Topher 's looking for . If there were any butchers down there , they 've probably torn each other apart . Well , let 's find out . I try to be my best . - Oh , hell . - ALPHA : Nope . You 'll have to keep digging if that 's where you want to end up . Alpha . I thought we lost you in Reno . I kind of let you think that . I lost my stomach for the fight . Thought I 'd help out some people who could use it . Cleared this place out . No wonder there 's so many butchers up there . They know about the dumb show buffet . Victor , why would someone do something so horrible to your face ? - Psycho . - Lapsed . We 've got wounded . Get Mag down here . I 'll prep the meds . - Where 's big bad Ballard ? - We lost him . - Man , I 'm sorry . When did that happen ? - Ten minutes ago . Tell me where to look , darling . Some things aren 't on the Cartesian plane . Is the tech you 're looking for in the lab ? The pineal gland , the seat of consciousness . I made it the seat of destruction . How many people do you think can sit on it before it breaks ? - You don 't mean the chair , do you ? - No . No , no , no . - What if there wasn 't anything ? - Then we took a road trip for nothing . - ROMEO : We 'd be okay with that . - What on Earth do you think you 're doing ? KILO : We came here for some juicy new prints , not to let you take our world away . ECHO : If you stay down here , you 'll be shielded just like us . You can stay who you are . The ohm resistance of 10 meters of concrete is the equivalent of ... No . We changed ourselves to survive up there , to thrive . Even if we don 't get wiped by the pulse , you 're still destroying who we are . I 've taken down guys twice as bad as you with guns twice as big . Our guns aren 't pointed at you , sister . ( GUN COCKING ) No ! Told him again and again and again . Guns don 't help me think . Guns don 't help me think . - ( SOFTLY ) We can take them . - ( SOFTLY ) You 'll get him killed . What 's going on , Rome ? Upgrades , Vic . Tell me you haven 't thought about it . Hold up . We tweaked ourselves to fight the war . It 's ending . Not anymore . Not if they don 't have him . And with all the tweaks on this computer , we 'll rule the wasteland . - Why wouldn 't you want that ? - Because we 're not freak shows . Well , okay , maybe I am . And Echo . Topher 's a little off , but Adelle , she 's a class act all the way . - Alpha ... - ALPHA : It 's just that I have worked so hard to have a peaceful life here . It 's harder for me than most . VICTOR : Hey , I get it . You think I don 't want every one of those skills firing through my head ? I know how good it feels . Skip learning the hard way . Skip the long hours . The sweat , the training , just to feel the thrill of perfection . But if we 're gonna rebuild the world , I want to do it myself . Sorry , boss . That means you stand with the Luddites . Did he just call me a Luddite ? You looking for these ? I 'll take him to the holding cell , the tiny one to medical . Figure out what to do with them after we set off the EMP . Let 's go , Romeo . Oh , God , she 's so cool . ( GROANING ) It 's okay . It 's okay . Everything 's gonna be okay . He 's tired . - He 's much worse when he 's tired . - Tired ? Bedtime . It was like this when I bought the place . Kill your idols . There 's a piece of truth . - I 'm very glad you didn 't clean up . - Well , it spoke to the schizophrenic in me . Well , both of them , actually . He didn 't come back for the tech . He came back for an idea . Synapse fires and I find a solution before the problem . How many times does B come before A ? - " Sniper . " " Demolition . " " Ernesto . " - He gave it up , Priya . He knew he couldn 't take you , and he 'll be back for these , I guarantee it . - Well , let him ! - Priya ! I wonder if I 'm in here somewhere . " Memory of Priya . " Pulls it out of his head , along with being human . - What the hell is wrong with you ? - This . This tech has been eating at my life . He 's in love with you . Are you really that thick ? This isn 't something that comes on a drive . They tried to pull it out of him . They wiped his mind for years and he never stopped loving you ! You want to kill the tech ? Kill it ! Shut it down ! Lock him out ! Give him nothing ! You can string him along for years ! You 've had years together , and what did you do ? You waste it ! Never tell him that you love him ! Never tell him that you 're grateful for him ! He 's dead ! He 's dead ! ( SOBBING ) He 's just dead and I never told him . Paul 's dead and I 'm alone . I 'm all alone . I 'm always alone . Paul ! BENNETT ON VIDEO : Welcome to lecture one in a three-part series entitled Neural Plasticity in Relation to Cortical Imprinting . ( PLAYING IN FAST FORWARD ) Her face has a look about her . The most effective way to imprint new pathways is with a timed electrostatic charge . It simulates the natural rewiring process of the brain . Basic neural plasticity . Every action affects our neural topography . We literally become what we do , not what we 've done or what we will do . We 're best defined by our actions in the moment . With a wavelength of more than two meters , little damage is done to the surrounding tissue . Thank you . Greater than two meters . - The connection goes there . - Yeah . Does this mean we 're finished ? - Where do we set off the device ? - High up . Higher up . The higher the better . Gamma rays bounce off the atmosphere . - Is my old office high enough ? - Yes , yes , yes . Perfect . It 'll hit the stratosphere . A minor explosion cascades into a major chain reaction . - Explosion ? - TOPHER : It does the work for you . You said it could only be activated manually . ( SIGHING ) You 're not coming back ? Small price to pay . ( WHISPERING ) I didn 't want to cause any more pain . Is now a bad time to ask for a favor ? T , I 'd like you to meet your father . Go . Hey . I 'm Anthony . But you can call me Tony . - That 's my name , too . - Yeah . Can I help you burn stuff ? You don 't have to do it , you know . At least not alone . I do . I 'll fix what we did to their heads . You fix what we did to the rest of the world . Your job is way harder . - Man , you don 't waste any time . - Shut up . I don 't have to . I 'm going . Our tiny messiah 's gonna be a 10-year-old soon . Somebody 's gotta look after her . - Caroline told me . - And you , stumpy , are going nowhere . - Except maybe down . - Take care of her , Zone . Try not to have any influence on her of any kind . And , you know , look us up in a year or two . Not if you paid me . Hey , Mag ? What did you do ? You know , before . I was at Berkeley . Sociology . You ? Landscape architect . I would never have called that one . People are such a mystery . - ECHO : Alpha just left ? - He said he couldn 't stay . And if he was gonna become what he was before ... He won 't . He 's evolved . He will again . Well , I think he 'd like to be alone when he finds out . Just in case . - And the rest of them ? - I 'll lead them out . Make sure they all come through the pulse all right . I 'm really the only one who can . - Ever the shepherd , huh ? - Leading them into the light . For good . Funny that the last fantasy the Dollhouse should fulfill would be yours . I don 't have any fantasies , Adelle . More 's the pity . Alpha said to dismantle all the tech in the building . He said you should start with the chair . - Having second thoughts ? - No way . I 'm the lucky one . I get to start over . ( BUZZING ) Huh . ( EVERYWHERE I GO PLAYING ) And I fall on my knees Tell me how 's the way to be Tell me how 's the way to go What happened ? It 's a long story , kid . Don 't worry about it . Everything 's gonna be all right . Tell me how 's the way to go Tell me how 's the way to be To evoke some empathy Danger will follow me now Everywhere I go Angels will call on me And take me to my home Well , this time I just wants to be at home And I fall on my knees Tell me how 's the way to go Am I ... - Are we ... - You wanted me to let you in . You sure you got room ? I got a lot of baggage . Childhood stuff . We will work through it . We 've got time . Tell me why I feel so low Angels will call on me And take me to my home And angel will fall on me now Everywhere I walk Angels will call on me And take me to my home And angels will call on me now Everywhere I go And angels will follow me now Lead me to my home English - US - SDH Ripped by stlc8tr

 SAM : Previously on Caprica ... ZOE : I 'm trapped in this robot body , but I don 't want my father to know I exist . AMANDA : It 's our job . We create life , and then one day we ... WILLIAM : I 'm learning so much hanging out with my uncle and his pals . What are you doing here ? I was helping . No , you always go to school first thing , all right ? You wait for them to take attendance , then you skip . You stick around here till 3 : 00 , and then I take you home . ( SPEAKING TAURONESE ) DANIEL : I 've decided to accept responsibility for my company 's impact on society . SARNO : Daniel Graystone . My company will make no more profit on the Holobands or V-World licensing . It 's 60 % of our net . Hold me to it , Caprica . TAMARA : I woke up in the virtual world without knowing how I got here . I need to find someone who can show me the way home . If this is a dream , I think it 's too long . I don 't think this is a dream . This is a door , all right ? Come on . You 'll be free . JOSEPH : Tamara 's avatar was my last hope of getting her back . DANIEL : Remember , it 's going to seem real , but it 's all virtual . Tamara ! JOSEPH : Tamara 's really gone ? I 'm sorry . But we can 't save them . SAM : Hi there . Morning . Anybody home ? Hey , what are you doing here ? It 's a school day . Yoseef , get up . Yoseef ! Yoseef , I said get up . Come on , up ! Hey , where you going ? Taking Willie to school . I 'll take him . It 's all right , he 's late . No , no , no , no , no . Just hang on a second . I 'll get changed . Dad , it 's okay . I kind of want Uncle Sam to take me . Go wait . ( SIGHS ) You going to work today ? You going to work today ? Yeah , it 's been a rough couple of weeks . It 's not as bad as it looks . No ? ' Cause it looks pretty frakked up . Well , then , why don 't you mind your own business ? This isn 't business . This is family ! You 're a Tauron , Yoseef . You remember that ? No . No , I 'm a Caprican . Isn 't that what you always tell me ? ( SCOFFS ) You call yourself whatever you want , but first , you be a father . And when you can manage that , maybe I 'll introduce you to your son . No , I ... Wake up , brother . Come on . ( SIGHS ) ( DANCE MUSIC PLAYING ) Um ... Excuse me . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . MAN 1 : Hey , what the frak ? WOMAN : Hey ! I 'm sorry . MAN 2 : Watch it . I 'm looking for someone named Vesta . I know she 's here . Is there a problem here ? MAN 3 : Pushing her way through like that . I need to talk to Vesta . ( LAUGHS ) Look , I am stuck here and I can 't get out . I heard she can help me get home . Please , just let me talk to her . If she can 't help me , I will leave . Okay , we 'll let you talk to her . But we get to watch . VESTA : Here we go . Here we go . One thousand . Put your bets down . Let 's go . Okay . A thousand ? Is this all you 're gonna bet ? Okay . Okay , let 's play . Let 's play . Yeah ? We got a taker . Brown dress . Claims she 's stuck . Okay . Fifteen hundred to you . ( PEOPLE CHEERING ) Grip . Pull . Fire . ( GUN FIRES ) ( PEOPLE CHEERING ) What just happened ? Where did he go ? He derezzed . He 's gone . Gone where ? Wherever . Home . Home ? I wanna play . You 're the girl who can 't get out . People have been talking about you . Look , I need to get outside . I need to go home . Can you please help me ? Take off your band , baby . I can 't ! ( GUN FIRES ) ( PEOPLE EXCLAIMING ) ( GROANING ) MAN 1 : She 's not derezzing . MAN 2 : What 's up with her ? Vesta . Vesta , she didn 't derez . Hmm . What do we have here ? ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) ( SHUSHING ) It 's gonna be all right . You and I are gonna help each other . VESTA : The pain should zap you out of the program , and you have to re-launch your avatar , but you ... TAMARA : Can 't . Don 't have to . She 's a sleeper . It 's supposed to be a myth . Someone who fell asleep with their Holoband on and can 't wake up . Somebody would 've woken me up by now . Well , maybe you 're unconscious , in a coma , and there must be something wrong with your band because it should 've timed out , but we can hack it . Do a manual disconnect . Some kind of price , isn 't there ? What do you want me to do ? Play a little game . That 's all . A game ? Yeah . Help me settle an old score . You play the game , I get you home . BYUN : She 's not bleeding . Never seen anyone heal before . Not in V-World . Clean her up . Get her some new clothes . You 're going . Now . ( PHONE RINGING ) ( MAN CHATTERING ON TV ) Yes , hi , this is Joseph Adama . This is Principal Andrews calling to check on Willie . What ? Well , he 's been out sick . No , no , no . He 's been at school . Well , he 's missed several days in a row now . You 've got to be ... How long ? Since the middle of last week . Oh , my Gods . I get that . That 's simple . It 's so ... Put the tray down , take the apron off , and come with me . Why don 't we go out back , Yoseef ? It 's quieter there . We could talk . Oh , we 've got nothing to talk about ! You frakking bee-known blahx ! That 's nice . A little Tauron comes in useful once in a while , doesn 't it ? Let 's go . Here 's a little Tauron saying for you , brother . ( SPEAKING TAURONESE ) I did not lose my son . Oh , really ? Then what are you doing here ? Where are you taking me ? This tunnel leads us to a different section of V-World . It 's a first-player game . Once we 're there , we 'll take out a big player . Clean out his in-game bank account , like a heist . None of us can come close to pulling this off , 'cause this guy 's got security . That 's not going to be a problem for you , okay ? What are you talking about ? You 'll see . Now get ready . Here we go . I 'm outside . TAMARA : Wait , is this Caprica ? HERACLES : It 's a virtual Caprica . A digital recreation , but it 's lawless . Anything goes . ( RATTLING ) ( RUMBLING ) Get down ! ( TAMARA SHRIEKS ) ( TAMARA CRYING ) ( SCREAMING ) What is this place ? Welcome to New Cap City . ( SOBBING ) So this whole city is like a game ? HERACLES : Yeah . It 's kind of like a different version of Caprica City . They update it so it matches . Even the place where the MagLev train blew up is here . A maglev train blew up ? How long have you been sleeping ? I don 't know . Okay , what 's the object of the game ? It 's a mystery . It 's almost like figuring out the object of the game is the object of the game . But we think it 's about getting things that convert into points , like money , or weapons ... So no one 's ever finished it ? Or won it ? Not yet . There 's this thing . When you die in the game , you 're out , and you can 't ever come back . But with you , I might actually have a shot . Okay , so our target is Chiron . He 's a fat cat . Likes to hang in this club on the lower east side . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) ( DANCE MUSIC PLAYING ) ( EXHALES ) Back booth . Don 't look , just glance . It 's Chiron . The Horse . Best gamer in the city . You 're gonna pull security away , and I 'll grab his avatar , okay ? If he 's the competition , why don 't you just kill him ? His avatar is more useful to us . It gets us into his vault , then we have his money . His virtual money . Well , that 's how you win the game . You think . That 's right . Deal is , you help us win the game , and Vesta gets you home . Look , it 's not real , okay ? It is to me . HERACLES : You 're gonna pull security away , and I 'm gonna grab his avatar . ( CHATTERING ) Chiron . TAMARA : You forgot to call me . I can forgive you , if you play it right . I 'm sorry , dear . I have no idea who you are . Now get the hell out of here . No , you have to remember . I mean , come on . It was so sweet . You said that I could have anything that I wanted . Don 't you remember what I said ? ( GASPS ) I said that ... I said ... ( TAMARA SHRIEKS ) ( GROANING ) MAN : She didn 't get sent back . WOMAN : What 's going on ? ( CRYING ) What ? Come on , come on . It 's okay , all right ? We 're gonna be okay . You did good . You did great . You did great . That just blows my mind . Well , was it worth it ? Did you get what you needed ? Yeah , we totally did . Look , just watch me now . Don 't be scared . You see ? ( IN CHIRON 'S VOICE ) It 's still just me . Anything that 's pure code can be manipulated . Now we can get into his bank vault , lift his virtual cash , and convert it into points in the game . ( IN NORMAL VOICE ) So we pull that off , and Vesta helps you . Look ... I know this must seem really random to you , but this game , it really does mean something to me . It actually allows me to be something . Maybe if you weren 't in here , playing this game , you could be something out there , too . WILLIAM : You look goofy . You 're gonna embarrass me . I know that there 's a great spot , just ... This is so boring . Let 's just go home , please ! You 're gonna be so happy when we 're eating it . It 's delicious fish . Come on . You know , we haven 't been here in a long time . Since we came here with Mom and Tammy last summer . That was a great day . They were practically jumping on the line . Do you remember that ? Not really . Listen , Willie , if you ever want to talk about anything , about Mommy or Tammy ... BOY : Hey , what are you looking at ? I 'm here for you . You know that , right ? Yeah . Could we just go home , please ? There 's no water . What are you talking about ? This is ... The less water , closer the fish are to the surface . Everybody knows that . Come on , get your rod . ( MOCKING ) BOY : Look at the little Tauron dirt-eater . You 've been unreachable for a day . I 'll call you back . And your assistant won 't look me in the eye . I think it 's time you told me what 's going on . The board called an emergency meeting . I 've been trying to figure out who 's behind it . Hmm . Is it Atkinson ? Well , it 's everyone . But , yeah , Atkinson , and Parker 's gonna be the one doing the talking . The others will sit on their hands , let him go on about the stock price tanking , your decision to give up the V-World ... So , if I don 't come up with answers to the Holoband crisis , they 're going to try to force me to step down from my own company . ( SIGHS ) Do they ... Do you think they have the votes ? Can we just go , please ? I want to go . Just wait a little longer . Don 't you love the fresh air and the beauty out here ? It 's much better than that smoke-filled room at Goldie 's . It 's so boring . Can we please go ? I don 't like it here . Can we please go ? Looks like it 's gonna be dirt again tonight ! Just , listen , ignore that . They 're idiots . You talking to me ? Who else would I be talking to ? JOSEPH : Hey , Willie , just ignore them . Willie , put that down . I said , " It must be fun to have all that dirt . " Really ? JOSEPH : Willie , get back here , right now ! Willie ! Hey ! No ! BOY : Get him , get him ! JOSEPH : Willie ! Hey ! Hey ! GIRL : Beat him up ! Come here . Stop it , Willie ! No ! Come here ! Did I wake you up ? No , I wasn 't sleeping . Not really . Maybe a few minutes . What 's going on ? I think that I might be losing my company tomorrow . ( LAUGHS ) Do you remember when I was pregnant with Zoe ? We were living in that flat in Cloverdale . And you were taking the bus all over town because that car , that you loved , never worked . It worked . We hadn 't paid the rent for , like , three months . You couldn 't afford even upper-level Bucs tickets . Things were really bad . But you had a big , fat meeting with MicroCap . And you knew nobody wanted to see you in there , but you didn 't care . Someone had done you a favor . So you worked on that thing for months . And on the day of the meeting , you fell in the pouring rain getting off the bus . You slipped helping some woman ... I remember . ... with a stroller , and you landed on your ass on the sidewalk . ( CHUCKLES ) So you walked into that meeting in a soaking wet suit , and what turned out to be a broken wrist , and you walked out of there with the deal that would start everything . PARKER : You can 't change the fact that he went on that show and killed the Holoband business . Well , he didn 't stick to the script . But on the flip side , our approval rating 's sky-rocketed . CYRUS : Exactly . And you think dumping the founder of this company now , in the middle of all this ... You think that 's going to help ? Daniel Graystone is the brand . He 's the public face of this corporation ... ( THUDDING ) What is that ? Hello , everyone . I 'm so sorry I 'm late . Daniel , I 'd just like to say , we all understand you 're going through an awful lot right now . Holobands are over . Excuse me ? Holobands are over ? The hacked sites are eating up more and more of our market share each quarter . And that 's where the kids are going , because they 're free . And the next generation coming up , they 'll expect it all to be free . We can 't own it forever . We can either marshal all our resources and funds towards saving that sinking ship , or we can look for the next big thing , the next big leap forward that will change the worlds . We either move into the future , or we die trying to hold on to our past . And this ... This is our future . Fancy machines that cost millions of cubits ? DANIEL : The cost is irrelevant , considering all that it can do . U-87 , make the circuit , please . Take a nice look at all these fine folks . Makes you a little uncomfortable , doesn 't it ? ( CHUCKLES ) Do you find yourself wondering what it might be thinking ? Or feeling ? Well , that is the big leap forward , people . Do you sense it ? Beyond artificial intelligence , this is artificial sentience . Do you feel it ? I feel it . Don 't you ? I feel like there is a being inside this machine , something alive and vital and special . And it 's not our imagination . Look at the test results . There is a brilliant mind in here . So , in terms of practical applications ... Are you seriously asking me about the practical applications of creating another race that will walk beside us ? ( LAUGHS ) Do you not understand the enormity of this creation ? It 's more than a machine . This Cylon will become a tireless worker who won 't need to be paid . It won 't retire or get sick . It won 't have rights , or objections , or complaints . It will do anything and everything we ask of it without question . U-87 , rip your arm off . Go on . Go on ! ( GASPS ) Looked a little painful , didn 't it ? The desire to anthropomorphize , the need to connect , it 's powerful . And that is why this thing is going to sell . We make them . We own them . They 're real . And the world 's just changed . So ... I believe you were going to take a vote ? Wait . Take a powder . I said blow . This place is a bank ? Where did the security go ? And where 's the vault ? The guards were pure code , not players . They are the security . They scanned the Chiron avatar , and it passed . As for the vault , we 're standing on it . ( SIGHS ) Vesta decoded this sequence from a puzzle across town . It was encoded on manhole covers . Really tough to get , but we got it . So I 'll just name off the signs and you step on them as I go , okay ? Okay , just hurry up . All right , you ready ? Yeah . Picon . Caprica . Gemenon . Picon . Tauron . ( VAULT UNLOCKING ) ( BEEPING ) See how this registers as points ? It 's gotta mean something . This has to be the point of the game . ( ALARM RINGING ) Oh , frak . ( GROANS ) How 'd you do that ? I don 't know . Gods , what are you ? JOSEPH : Willie , do your homework . ( CLICKING ) ( SIGHS ) Willie , stop that . Stop it ! ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) What have you been teaching him , Sam ? Same things we 've been taught . He 's gonna be a man soon , Yoseef . You know , on Tauron , at his age , he already would be . He 's gonna make choices . I don 't know what to do , Sam . You know what to do , Yoseef . It 's what you 've been thinking about . It 's what you 've been avoiding . Too Tauron for you , maybe , but not for your son . You 're losing him . You are losing him , Yoseef . Your son needs closure . It 's time to let Shannon and Tamara go . Look past yourself and perform the rites , brother . You got the votes . You better be right . ( MEN CHATTERING ON RADIO ) ( DOORBELL RINGS ) ( SPEAKING TAURONESE ) Welcome to our home . Tsattie , what 's taking so long ? WOMAN : What are you doing ? Get out of here . They 're ready . I know what this is for . I know what it 's for . Go , go , go , go . You ready ? I 'm ready . You sure moved in fast . Did you get it ? She 's amazing . Stopped the guards , messed with the codes . Like hacking without even hacking . Really ? Interesting . Bring it to me . No . You 're gonna wake me up , get me home , and then you get your money . Yeah , well , see , I 've been looking into that , and I can 't . It 's only a month old . It 's yellowing , but you can still make out the names on the list . What a shame . Tamara Adams , 16 years old . 615 Olympic Street , number 3 , Caprica City . Isn 't that you , baby ? So young . Wait , wait , I don 't get it . What 's the list ? What 's the list of ? It doesn 't matter . You 're dead , baby . Does that explain why she can do what she did to the guards ? I think it might . BYUN : You 're not going home , doll face . VESTA : Don 't worry . We 've got plenty for you to do , baby . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . You need to go to the real world . You need to find my father . You know the address . You heard it . 615 Olympic , number 3 . I 'll wait for you in New Cap City , so you can find me . I can 't go back to the real world , okay ... You could be something there ! Just take off your Holoband , okay ? You 're not gonna die here . Just go . What are you ? ( EXHALES ) I 'm awake . ( GUN FIRES ) Do you have a coin for me , Yoseef ? I have a coin for my wife , Shannon Adama . I have a coin for my sister , Tamara Adama . Will you grant them passage ? They will have passage . Will you let them go ? Yes . Yes . Will you bid them farewell ? ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) Goodbye , Shannon . Goodbye , Tamara . Goodbye , Tamara . Goodbye , Mom . Then they will live forever in peace . They will live forever in your hearts . ( WOMAN SINGING IN TAURONESE ) ( DOORBELL RINGS ) That 's a good one . Hi , can I help you ? Hey , are you Joseph Adams ? It 's Adama . How can I help you ? Tamara sent me . What are you talking about ? She gave me this address , right . Okay , look , she 's in the V-World and she can 't get out . So , if you can just help me ... You saw her ? Yeah , but I think she 's just sleeping or something . So if you could just please go wake her up , she really needs that . My daughter 's dead . She died in the MagLev attacks . ( PANTING ) Oh , Gods , I 'm sorry . You saw her in V-World ? I did . You gotta take me there . You gotta take me to see her , okay ? Hey . Hey ! JOSEPH : Stop ! Stop ! ( GROANS ) ( PANTING ) Hey . Tammy .

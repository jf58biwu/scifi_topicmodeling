 I 've got Isaac . He 's made contact- - female , early 20s . They 're on the move . The girl seems to be leading . Gary , can you get me an image ? Yeah , okay , I got it . See the way she 's moving ? She 's an Alpha , too . She 's processing her environment somehow . Isaac Hale 's an assassin , right ? My guess is she 's his tracker . She finds the target , and our man closes the deal . I don 't get it . Sullivan said that Red Flag leaders have been vanishing off the grid all week . Something 's up . Well , he 's our only lead . So keep an eye on him . But don 't engage . Hey , hey , there 's a pawnshop . We can sell it here . No , no , these places rip you off . Baby , you 're hurting . We need the money . No , Will . Come on , let 's go . Let 's go . You have something of mine . You can piss off . No , baby , don 't . Go , go , come on ! Don 't make me kill you . It makes me tired , and then I get cranky . He found his target . - Where ? - Down the alley ! Left ! Go left ! Come on ! Will ! Get off him . I know you 're a couple of brain-dead junkies , but for once , be smart . Give it back . He said piss off . Your fault . Cover 's blown . We were supposed to be following him . Will ? You killed him . Danielle . No . Nina ! Push her . Make her come with us . Dani ! Rachel , go after Isaac . It 's okay . It 's okay . Cameron , follow Isaac . I-I-I have to go after that girl . What 's so special about the girl ?

She just made you cry ? It just came out of nowhere ? When she touched me , I felt like I lost my best friend . It 's like she can force people to feel whatever she wants . Sure as hell didn 't seem too happy to see Rosen . Man , if my kid ever looked at me that way ... - I lost him . - Damn it . You lost someone ? Yeah , I 'm not the one who flew in there like Jackie Chan and blew our cover . Hey , I 'm not sure if you noticed , but he was killing people . Gary , you got anything ? Yeah , Danielle Sophia Rosen . She ran away from home at 17 , and she was arrested- - No , look , not about Rosen 's daughter , about Isaac Hale . No , I lost him when Rachel did . But--but don 't worry . I 'm multitasking . We should circle the neighborhood , see if Rachel can track his scent . Okay . Okay . Just don 't drive by that Thai place , okay ? It totally kills my sense of smell . Hello ? Where is everybody ? Who 's Manning the fort ? It 's not a fort , Bill . That 's a bad metaphor . Forts have ramparts and cannons . We have desks and carpet . You 're sitting in the boss ' chair ? What , are you in charge now ? Where is everybody ? Yeah , Bill , I am in charge when no one else is here . What are you doing here anyway ? You 're sick . You should be resting- - six more days , not including the weekend . I 'm fine . The doctor , uh , said that that infarction actually normalized me , so ... Infar- - Yeah , no more overdrive , no more under-drive--I 'm optimal . So that rest was only precautionary . - Bill , Bill . - Yeah ? Infarction . Come on . Gary , not now . Listen- - Fart . - Listen , we 've got to focus . - I 'm being immature . You know we 've been trying to figure out why the Red Flag leadership has been off the grid , right ? Yeah , it 's an ongoing investigation . And you 're interrupting it . No , I 'm laying at home , right , sitting on my ass , and I 'm thinking I may actually have a possible lead . You know how that invisible girl , Griffin , said I need to find out who or what Stanton Parish was , right ? Yeah , well , go and look it up on your computer , Bill . It 's easy . Use a search engine . Gary , listen to me , I already tried that . I couldn 't find anything , all right ? Don 't put your fingers in my stream . Then I got to thinking . Why did Red Flag try so hard to erase our M.K. Ultra files ? What if the secret to Stanton Parish is on Dr. Rosen 's cloud drive ? Bill , you want me to look through the cloud drive ? Uh , yeah , exactly what- - Well , I can 't . I 'm already multitasking . No , Gary , you can do it all , Gary . I 'm looking for Isaac and I 'm tracking Dani . Who the hell is Dani ? There 's Dani . Dr. Rosen , I got your daughter . Can I have my key ? She 's at the Baltimore Hotel . That 's a no-star hotel . The only review says , " Don 't stay here . " Dani ! Danielle . Danielle , are you in there ? Danielle . Dani , if you 're in there , please open the door . I thought I was hallucinating . You 're not ... As--as far as I can tell . I don 't want you here . Well , I-I don 't want you here . I-I want you to come with me . No . That 's nice , Dad . Dani ... Dani , you 're in pain . Just leave me alone . I know you 're always hurting after you use your ability . I don 't care . Will you please just let me help you ? Oh , what are you gonna do- - give me another therapy session ? Dani , run . Run . Come on . Get off of me ! Dani ... Dani ! Come on . Come on . Two for one . Nobody had to die . You just had to give them back . Dani , will you sit down for a second , please ? I 'd like to check your vitals . Please , Dad , I am not gonna make you cry ... At least not from my ability . So what are you on now- - painkillers again or what ? Come on , don 't tell me we 're gonna have an intervention . Just trying to help . Not bad . So what is it ? Lamotrigine . Lamotrigine ? That 's an anticonvulsant , among other things . Yeah , I know . I mean , it 's- - it 's not what I 'm on , but it 's what works best ... Better than the Ritalin you used to give me , even better than the Trazadone , and better than the Oxycontin , which , uh , by the way , I did take a few hours ago . Just in case you were gonna ask me to give you a urine sample next , so ... Okay , okay . Fine . Lamotrigine . Look , why don 't you just write me a prescription , put it on your insurance , and I 'll be out of your life again . Don 't think so . I 'm , uh , sorry about that boy . Oh , well , he was hardly a boy . He was 34 years old . Dani , I need to know why that man was chasing you . Finally there 's the real question . His name was Isaac Hale . He killed people for a living . He was part of a group called Red Flag . Red Flag--is that one of your punk bands ? You know , Dani , there are no rules that say you can 't tell the truth every once in a while . There it is . That 's what I remember- - that disapproving look . Sorry to interrupt . Lee ? He 's all yours . We have a time- - tomorrow morning , 7 : 00 a.m. Wait a minute . What exactly are we talking about here ? We 've been monitoring Red Flag 's communications ever since their leaders started dropping off the grid . We don 't know what they 're planning or where , but we have a timeline now , so we are on the clock . Lee ? Kathy , I don 't think you understand . The young woman in my office- - Yeah , I know she 's your daughter . That 's why I 'm not questioning why you killed our best lead . But you did . And now I need you to set aside your family business- - Red Flag wanted something from my daughter , so badly that they were willing to kill her for it . If your daughter can help us with this case , great . But if not , you 're a therapist . Compartmentalize . I know you 're concerned , honey . But I wouldn 't have come to work if I wasn 't feeling better . All right ? You know that about me . I don 't need the- - - Bill , I found it . - I don 't need the pills , babe . I 'm at work . I 'm busy , okay ? - Bill , what- - you 're drinking pills . Bill , come on , I found it . You asked me to do this . Babe , I got to go . I 'll go- - yes , I 'll take it easy . Yeah , you found who ? Stanton Parish- - he was a who . And you were right- - he was on the cloud drive . So he 's a scientist who died in 1974 . Yeah , and he worked for the government , for M.K. Ultra . And before he died , he wrote this , Bill . It 's a manifesto about Alphas . And back then , they weren 't even called Alphas . All right , so , " Neuro-dominant humanity represents " the greatest potential advancement for civilization " since man first walked upright , " which is why those who fear change " will inevitably seek to eliminate us . " The- - he was an Alpha ? Yeah , and he was a good writer . Anna writes stuff like this . Stanton Parish is Red Flag 's favorite dead author ? No , invisible girl made it sound like this guy was the key to everything . So there 's got to be more , Gary . - Bill , look how much I printed . - No , I know , this is a lot . But there 's got to be more . Please keep digging . Yeah , I-I I don 't think I like hard work . Dani , I need you to tell me the truth about what happened . We don 't have time for games . Of course we don 't have time for games . We never had time for games . There 's blood tests , psych tests , E.E.G.s , sure , but games ? Why don 't you just stick some electrodes to my forehead , Dad ? Just for old times ' sake , tell me how I 'm feeling . - That was 15 years ago- - - So I should be over it ? I mean , is that what you 're saying ? You 're in serious trouble , Danielle . You need to calm down , tell me what happened , so I can help you . So you want to help . You know what Will would do when I was upset ? Bring me flowers ... Get me whatever drug I needed , even if he had to steal it . Then again , he loved me , so ... Well , I love you , too . You want to know what Red Flag was after ? These . I took ' em from some guy at a meeting . I thought they were rubies . But , uh , it turns out they 're just glass . Hands up . Ow . I don 't like- - Ow . Anna . It 's good to see you . You always say that we can 't meet up . But I-I wanted to see you again . It 's good to see you . It has all your sounds on there . That 's very cool , Anna . I 've missed our conversations . Yeah , I 've missed them , too . And doctor- - oh . Okay . I wish you were here for another reason . That quote you sent me , Gary ... Oh , yeah . " Society 's acceptance is a prison disguised as a palace . " Where did you find that ? It 's Stanton Parish . Is he your favorite writer , Anna ? Gary , Stanton Parish is a very dangerous man . You shouldn 't be asking questions about him . Anna you said " is . " Stanton Parish is dead . He died 30 years ago . He--he 's Red Flag 's favorite dead author . You need to go now , Gary . Anna , why- - why do I have to go now ? I just got here . Why do I--Anna , Anna , don 't make me go . It was difficult for me to come and see you . Anna , I had to be sneaky . Ow . Anna . Dani you did the right thing giving us the necklace . Thank you . We should talk . Will you sit down , please . - The past is past , okay ? - Okay . And I-I think you 'll find that I 'm a pretty different person than I was 15 years ago . Are you ? To me , you seem to be pretty much exactly the same ... Except now you have a whole team of people to play with . Don 't talk about what you don 't know . You have no idea what 's going on . Dad , there are different kinds of lying . You can tell people what they want to hear . You can , uh , pretend that you care . And then there 's outright manipulation . And when have I ever manipulated you ? " Camel mealie . " Chamomile tea ? Whenever mom would get angry at you for locking yourself in a room with your lab work , you would come to me and say , " Dani , mommy 's sad . " " Please bring her a cup of ' camel mealie ' tea . " Right , no , I remember . But , Dani , that 's not- - So I would bring her the tea , and I would sit on her lap , and I would stroke her arm , and she 'd feel better . Empathic contagion , right ? Isn 't that what you call it ? All right , that 's right . Well , that was me . I was mommy 's little helper . But , uh , you know , that 's not exactly the way it happened . And that was before I knew about your ability . You 're right , Dad . you 're always right ... Except with the tea , I did that until mom and I moved out ... when I was 12 . You knew what I could do when I was nine . Hey , Doc . Doc , come here . Listen ... You okay ? Yeah , it was a mistake to bring my daughter here . We have 12 hours to figure out what Red Flag is up to . No , no , listen to me , Doc- - That 's what we should be working on . Doc , listen to me . Listen to me . We haven 't cracked it yet , but Gary and I just found something that is huge . You need to see it now . All right . So we looked for the name , but all we found was a book by a dead guy . And then when I asked Anna about it , she just lied to me again . Gary , you spoke with Anna ? I expressly told you not to do that . Doc , I told him the same thing , okay ? But he 's his own man now . Now , just give him a minute . Yeah , yeah , give me a minute . I 'm my own man . Thanks , Bill . So Anna 's a good liar , not like me . But--but I still caught her , because she said " is " instead of " was . " Stanton Parish isn 't a dead writer . - He 's alive . - Bill , please ... So I did another search , but not by name , by face , and that 's- - that 's the creepy part Bill was talking about . There , he was a scientist in Russia for their M.K. Ultra program- - same face , same man . So Stanton Parrish was a double agent . No , no , no , Dr. Rosen , it 's a puzzle . You have to look at all the pieces . It 's a metaphor . Okay . Okay . Just- - Same face . Stanton Parish . Stanton Parish . Stanton Parish . Wait . This is from the Civil War . Yeah , it 's old . He was about 40 years old , right ? Same guy 100 years later when he worked for M.K. Ultra . Is this an Alpha who doesn 't age ? Anna says that he 's dangerous . She 's scared of him , and Anna 's not scared of anyone . And there 's this . He wrote this- - the manifesto . Bill says it 's the Red Flag playbook . An Alpha this powerful and we knew nothing about him ? Well , that 's why they were trying to erase our files- - to keep Parish hidden . Meet the new boss ... Same as the old boss . I got it . The rubies- - I figured it out . These may seem like junk , but this is laboratory-grown silicon , more densely organized than anything I have ever seen . It is the perfect storage medium . So I decided to ... Play around . And then in this ... Inside the pendant , I discovered this . - It 's a jump drive . - Voila . - Gary , can you ... ? - Oh , yeah , yeah , yeah . I 'll do this . There . Wait a minute . That 's--that 's encoded data , right ? So , Gary , isn 't that Anna 's language ? Yeah , that 's what Anna does . She sends messages . Like the D.O.T. numbers on the truck they blew up , the order to assassinate Dr. Rosen ... No , no , she regrets that . She said that that 's regrettable . We 'll argue about that later , okay ? Can you translate this ? Yeah . Those are GPS coordinates . Yeah , it leads to Highland Mills . That 's not far from here- - 60 miles . It 's a map . Directions . No , no , it 's an invitation . You see right here ? There 's a time , 7 : 00 a.m. , like Sullivan said , tomorrow morning . All right , so that 's a time and date for a meeting . - What 's that underneath ? - That part 's sneaky . It 's even sneakier than Anna 's code . So , what 'd I steal ? Oh , okay , no , no , no . I 've got it . It 's a quote- - here , at the bottom . " We are not the problem . We are the solution . " It 's from that book , A Call to Change . It 's more than a quote , Gary . It 's a signature ... from the leader of Red Flag , Stanton Parish . He 's called this meeting . We confirmed the intel you gave us . Nice work on that . The target--an old abandoned brick factory . We 're bringing in tactical teams , special equipment , everything we can throw at them . You 're positive this supposed leader of theirs is going to be there ? Well , he called the meeting . I suppose he 'll be there . And Anna 's gonna be there , too . And you can 't hurt her . She--she 's my friend . And she can 't protect herself . Our first move will be tear gas and nonlethal weapons . But let me be clear . These terrorists will be neutralized . Yes , Senator ? Gary , maybe you should go home . No , I 'm not going home . Anna 's gonna be there , and I 'm gonna be there . I 'm part of the team . Okay , well , I 'll join in with tactical , do what I can . And , uh , I 'll protect Anna if it 's possible . Doc , you 'll stay outside and coordinate with Rachel and Gary . I 'm gonna go in with Hicks and Nina . Bill , you can go in , but only as an agent . It 's too early to put that kind of stress on your heart . This is Red Flag versus us . This is endgame . I 'm in . Here you go , Doc . It 's time . Hey . Hey . These guys you 're going after- - is it their fault that Will 's dead ? Yes , I believe it is . Then I hope you get all of ' em . Rosy future ... Something someone once said that I wanted . And he wasn 't wrong . What would that even look like ? Dani ... You were right . About the tea . I knew about your ability . And so I used it . I used you to try to save a marriage that I 'd already ruined . I-I-I don 't know what you expect me to say , Dad . I don 't expect you to say anything . You don 't have to . I just wanted you to hear it . No , I 'm not coming home tonight , Mom . I ... I can 't tell you . But my friends need my help ... All of my friends . Yeah , I love you , too , Mom . Mom , please , don 't cry . Listen , Bill 's gonna protect me . He 's my partner , he--he 's very strong . One time he pushed me over , which was better than taking a bullet . I said don 't cry . Come on , time to saddle up . Let 's go . Anna 's here- - two bodyguards . That makes over 30 Red Flag Alphas inside . Gary says that 's the last car heading this way , as far as he can tell . We have to hurry . Dr. Ro- - Dr. Rosen . Dr. Rosen , you should let me go and talk to- - you should let me go and talk to Anna , 'cause I could get them to surrender . I always get people to do what I want to do , 'cause I-I wear them down . Yeah , you do that , Gary . Gary , this is a very dangerous situation . If you want to be here , you have to do exactly as you 're told . Yep . You look like you belong here . Once a marine ... I thought you hated the Marines . It 's kind of a love-hate . Look , if anything happens to me ... Don 't say it . It 's bad luck . Still no sign of Parish ? Nothing- - he never showed and neither have about another dozen Red Flag leaders . From what I can hear inside , they are not happy about it . I don 't get it . He calls the meeting . He doesn 't show ? It doesn 't make sense . He should- - - it 's starting . What are they saying ? Hiding like this is only making things worse . You don 't get to decide that . Let her talk ! They 're talking about going public . Going public ? Telling the world the truth about Alphas . Remember , stick with your teams , watch your fields of fire , and give the gas time to work . No one advances until I say so . Agent Sullivan , Kathy . Wait , wait , we--we can 't do this . Put some socks on , Lee , your feet are getting cold . No , will you bear with me just--just for a moment ? The day before this meeting was supposed to happen , a Red Flag assassin leads us right to my daughter , who is carrying an invitation , which my team decodes just in time for us to be here . Now , what does that sound like to you ? A setup . So you think we 're walking into an ambush . No , I think we are the ambush . Stanton Parish gathered these people here . He tips us off to their location just so that we 'll do exactly what we 're doing . Why would Stanton Parish betray Red Flag ? According to you , it 's his organization . Because Rachel just heard the people inside talking . They 're talking about coming out of the dark , revealing their secrets . - Going public ? - Yes . Well , then it 's a good thing we 're here , Lee . No , Kathy , and I am betting that 's exactly what Stanton Parish wants you to feel . You 're playing right into his hands . You are betting , you think . A week ago , you didn 't even know that Stanton Parish existed . And now apparently you 're in his head . I don 't have time for your theories , Lee . Do the people in that building belong to a terrorist organization ? It 's not that simple . Really ? Because I think it 's a yes or no question . Are they Red Flag or not ? All right , I 'm not saying that they 're all innocent- - Well , good . Then you haven 't lost your mind altogether . Go ! Get into your positions now ! Oh , Rachel , this is a mistake . This is a big mistake . Team one in position . Team two on the move . You 're wearing a mask . You can 't push anyone . - You should hang back . - I 'll be okay . Team two in position . Ready on your go , command . Release the gas . Federal agents . Surrender and no one will get hurt . Get out ! Run ! Command , team leader- - rounding up suspects . No , no . No ! No ! - Dr. Rosen- - - Gary ! Gary ! Gary , no ! Rachel , stay here . Stay here . Gary ! Anna ! Anna , I 'm coming ! You 're like me . Better . Gary ! Gary ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Ah ! No , no ! Gary . Gary ! Sleep . Gary ! Wait , Gary . Man down ! Man down ! Permission to open fire ? Copy that . Return fire is authorized . Return fire is authorized . Fire at will . Anna ! Anna ! Anna ? Anna ! Ah ! Ah ! Anna ! Anna ! Anna . Anna , it 's okay . Anna , come on . I 'll help carry you . Anna ... Anna , come on , I 'll- - Anna . Anna . Anna , come on . Anna , get- - don 't--no ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! He 's one of us . Gary , Gary . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Anna ! People died . Anna died . And she shouldn 't be dead . And it--if I- - if I had a gas mask , I probably could have saved her . Gary , you don 't know that . Yeah , well , you don 't know either--nobody knows . And Dr. Rosen- - he doesn 't know . See , he pretends to know everything , but he doesn 't . I don 't know if I can keep doing this . I don 't think I 'm the only one who feels that way . No , she 's not . We don 't know what we 're doing . And I 'm not sure if we ever did . And right now there is no " this . " No , Cameron , you 're wrong . This is a team . And that hasn 't changed . What you 've done you 've done for the right reasons , under circumstances that sometimes were beyond even our control . You followed your instincts . You followed your hearts . You have nothing to be ashamed of . We have to stand on that . Yeah , but ... What about the fact that every time we- - Lee . Sorry , excuse me . Could I talk to you for a minute ? Yeah . Is this where you explain all about clouds and silver linings ? Not me . Hey ... This is still a win , Lee . A win for who- - us or Stanton Parish ? If Parish exists , we 'll get him . So you have whatever resources you need . Money , equipment- - it 's yours . You want another Alpha on your team ? Pick one . Pick five . How would your daughter like a job ? Can we please not talk about my daughter ? Fair enough . Look , I know you 're not able to see it right now , but the raid on Highland Mills was a success . It crippled Red Flag . We caught terrorists . We stopped this Alpha situation from being blown wide open . And that is a huge victory for you and your team . Thank you . And if you need proof , the powers that be would like your input on how to move forward . Closed-door session in D.C. a week from today . We look forward to your thoughts . They 're calling it a success , this raid , but I 'm not so sure , which is par for the course these days . You know , when I was little , I , uh--well , I thought you knew more about everything than anyone else in the world . And , um , I guess now I see that you don 't know all the answers to the questions , and sometimes you don 't even know the questions . Well , I guess that 's part of growing up- - realizing that your parents have feet of clay . Yeah , well , to tell you the truth , I like you better this way . Dani , what you 've been through- - what I 've put you through- - it must have been incredibly painful . You can 't even imagine , Dad . No , I can 't . You know , I tend to intellectualize everything , approach everything from an analytical standpoint , but , um ... You 're not my patient . You 're my daughter . I never really understood emotionally what it felt to- - to be you . So , Danielle ... I want you to do your thing . I don 't think that 's a good idea . I want to know . I- - oh , I don 't know what to say . Then it worked . Dr. Rosen ? I 'm Stanton Parish . Your daughter 's fine . Nothing to worry about . I came alone . So , tell me , doctor , how does it feel to be living your dreams ? You 've always wanted to be on the cutting edge , to make your mark in history . You 've achieved that . By helping you purge Red Flag of everyone not in lockstep with your plans ? You 're upset about that . Now , be honest . Secrecy serves us all . You want to protect your team . Government wouldn 't know what to do if this went public . And for now ... I operate best in the dark . Obviously not everyone in Red Flag agrees with you . Hmm , troublemakers . You and I- - we put an end to them . That coldness , that complete lack of empathy- - it 's just what I expected your downside to be . So what else ? You don 't age . You probably don 't even get sick . I doubt you even sleep . Think beyond Alpha . I have complete control of my mind- - perfect brain-body connection . At the cost of your humanity . I am humanity ... What humanity will become . The future belongs to people like me , and certainly we can agree on that . Hey , you can stop trying to manipulate me into feeling that we share an agenda , some kind of connection . I 'm every bit as good at that as you . Oh , but we do have a connection . That we both use people ? But for completely different ends . No , we don 't share a damn thing . You advocate bloodshed and war . War ... It 's inevitable , in two years , maybe three- - nothing that you or I can do to stop that . You 'll forgive me if I try . You 're wasting your talents , Lee . You 're so close to understanding it all . The answers to the questions you 've been asking ever since you realized that your daughter was different . The biology of Alphas ... The great mystery of the human brain ... I can get you there . And in return ? I have so many plans on the verge of fruition . You can help with that . People die because of your plans . I 've helped you enough . Think about it . You 'll come around . When I first discovered the Alpha phenomenon , I was just a doctor treating a group of remarkable patients . Since then , events have unfolded in ways that no one could have predicted , starting with the emergence of Red Flag . Here , straight from Klauswerks . Thanks , Gary . Hey , and don 't forget to shave , all right ? - It is Congress , after all . - Oh , Rachel . Red Flag , is a radical Alpha organization which is willing to do anything , even commit murder , to advance its cause . Cameron , Dani 's at my house . Will you look in on her from time to time ? Yeah , I 'll keep her safe . Now , the government 's response to their actions has been understandably swift and aggressive ... Good luck . Come here . Gathering intelligence , deploying tactical units , and even using my own covert team of Alphas . But despite all efforts , the situation has become increasingly unstable , culminating with the incident at Highland Mills . Those responsible for the group 's violent ideology are still out there . Indeed , their founder and leader , Stanton Parish , is still at large . I , uh , understand your concern , Dr. Rosen . And we 're willing to provide you with as many tactical teams as you need . I believe that Binghamton is nowhere near capacity . Am I right ? - Yes , uh , Binghamton- - I was coming to that . A clandestine prison hospital . Where Alphas are confined and subjected to experiments , without any respect paid to their civil rights or their humanity . Binghamton is not the answer . Binghamton is part of the problem . Red Flag and the government 's Alpha program are two sides of the same coin . They both rely , all too frequently , on violence and secrecy , abuses that can only thrive in the dark ... Son of a bitch is actually gonna go through with this . Thank you , Dr. Rosen . That 's very interesting . Thank you for your time . Which is precisely what their leader , Stanton Parish , wants- - darkness . And by our keeping the Alpha phenomenon a secret , we are only following a path- - his path , which I believe can only lead to a war . So what I am advocating , Senator , is not more money or more guns or even a bigger prison . I am calling for light , for transparency , an end to secrets . And so I say to all of you here ... and to all of you watching , Alphas exist . They are among us . They are our friends and our spouses . They are our sons and daughters . Our neighbors , our co-workers . This just got complicated . They are indeed us , and they are not going away . Order ! This is what we have been hiding . Turn his microphone off , and I don 't want this on the record ! This is what we have been hiding . - I warned you . - Yes . Yes , you did . Sharing this truth may make things messier , more complicated . But it will hold both sides accountable for their actions . And it will also prevent this war ... Security ! Stanton Parish so badly wants . And by sharing this truth , it 's time for everyone ... Hurry up , security , get this man out of here ! To open their eyes , to open their minds , and to open their- - = = sync , corrected by elderman = =

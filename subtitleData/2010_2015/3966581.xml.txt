 Previously on Fringe ... How does she seem ? Like Olivia Dunham . She 's internalized her traits . For all intents and purposes , she is our agent Dunham . You 're imbedding one of them on my team ? What if her new identity doesn 't hold ? Then she 'll no longer be necessary . So you know things about the other side . Things you couldn 't know unless you were from there . Like what ? Your niece is alive . She was born , and it 's her birthday today . There 's no way to prove it . Yes , there is . Their Olivia can travel between worlds safely . We believe you may be able to the same . Aunt Liv ! I knew you wouldn 't forget my birthday . Ahh ! It didn 't work . All I saw was black . Through suffering comes redemption . Through sorrow comes exaltation . Through pitch dark comes a cleansing fire . Through the fire , we shall find a spring of new life . Mommy ? Max ? There 's a monster in my closet . No monsters here . None there either . Looks like your room is officially monster-free tonight , kiddo . Now , you remember what big boys do to get rid of monsters in their room ? Well , you close your eyes , and you count to three . And when we open them ? The monster 's gone . You get some rest , sweetie . I love you . One , two , three . Polls show that most Americans oppose the proposed law to limit the number of children to two per family ... However , leading politicians from two of the three major parties favor the law ... Hey . You . W-what are you doing here ? Can I buy you breakfast ? Thank you . Thanks . I need to get into the D.O.D. facility on Liberty Island , and I need your help . I can steal a boat , but I can 't leave it docked on the island , otherwise the security patrol would find it , and I need some time inside the building alone . I just need you to get me across the water . Across the patrolled water . You 're with Fringe division . Don 't you have super-secret clearance or something ? Why you breaking into a government building ? Because I have to go home . Oh , so home is on Liberty Island now . It doesn 't matter where I 'm from . What matters ... what matters is that I 'm in trouble , and I think that my time is running out here , and right now you are the only person that I 'm willing to trust . I need your help , Henry . Please , will you help me ? So if all you 're asking for is a ride ... You ain 't got to steal a boat . My cousin has one . Just give me a day or so . Thank you . Yeah . Okay , there 's my number . I gotta go . Hey . Those people you 're running away from , they still after you ? Not if they keep believing that I 'm somebody else , no . Thanks . We 'll let you know if Fringe division officially assumes the case . Thanks . Appreciate it . So what do we have ? Kid was abducted from his bedroom last night . Okay , we 're good down here . Molecular cohesion intact . Atmosphere readings are solid . Now , these kidnappings are tragic , but 99 % of them have nothing to do with Fringe division . Yeah , tell that to the secretary . Peter Bishop act of ' 91 says every kidnapping gets treated like a possible fringe event . All I 'm saying is that these cops don 't need us to work their cases , okay ? Waste of manpower . It 's not a waste . I 'll get a statement . Let 's check upstairs . Detective ? Would you mind walking us through the scene ? Sure . Uh , victim is Max Clayton , eight years old . Mom came to check on him in the morning , and he was gone . We , uh ... we found a couple of partial prints on the windowsill and in the closet , but we 're still collecting evidence . We believe the suspect snatched the kid , and he , uh , fled out the window . Well , it 's a long way down , especially if you 're carrying a 50-pound kid . Okay , so the suspect is probably male , strong , uh , say 20 to 35 . Hey , can I see that for a second ? There 's some kind of residue on these fingerprints . Sucrose . Sugar ? What , was he eating cookies or something ? Uh-uh . He secretes it through his sweat . It 's the candy man . He 's back . Mr. Secretary . I just heard . Fringe division was created to investigate tragedies of unimaginable scale . You and I both know that there 's no crime more heinous than the theft of a child . I 'll do everything I can to find him , sir . I don 't doubt your resolve , Phillip . Actually , that 's why I 'm here . There 's no shame in letting it fall to another desk if it 's too personal . It 's been four years since the candy man took my son . Four years ... Since I heard him laugh or watched him play outside with his sister . He had my son for two days . When I got him back , he wasn 't a little boy anymore . If there 's anyone you want on this case ... It 's me . Very well . My only concern is that I don 't have all of my agents to help me . How long until this is over , sir , until our Olivia comes home ? You 'll be happy to know we made a breakthrough . We found something in her brain chemistry , something unique . If it 's what enables her to cross between worlds , you 'll have your team back very soon . I know what it 's like to lose a son . And even when they come back , the damage is irreparable . If you need someone to talk to , Phillip , let me know . We need a lead , folks . Something to go on . It 's been 18 hours since the Clayton boy went missing . That gives us until tomorrow night to find him . The candy man 's last kidnapping was two years ago , before you joined Fringe division . I remember when this happened , reading about it , but they never said what he did to these kids . It 's like they 've had the life drained out of them . Acute deterioration of organ tissue , depleted immune systems . Some of the kids even came back with cancer . Those incisions ... why there ? Posterior cerebral cortex . From that point on the body , you can access the spine . Okay , Astrid , what do we know about these cases ? The abductions themselves appear to be random , occurring every two years . The victims are always children ages seven through nine . They are taken , then released 48 hours later with massive internal degradation . The victims describe the suspect as male , age unknown . In the majority of cases , other than a shaved head , there 's no physical description given , because he wore a mask . What do you mean " in the majority of cases " ? Two of the victims reported being held captive by two suspects , one young and one old . Then why haven 't we expanded the profile to look for two suspects ? Liv , these kids were really scared . There 's a lot of inconsistencies in their statements . Well , that doesn 't mean that they 're not true . Can you please pull up the victim 's BIOS ? Okay , Amanda holt and Christopher ... Broyles . We should speak to Christopher again . That 's not a good idea , liv . You weren 't here when it happened . Broyles is protective . Well , we should at least ask . Liv ... Don 't even think about it . I would like to reinterview your son . Excuse me ? Christopher reported that he was held by two men ... an older man and a younger man . Now , if that 's true , he may remember other things about this guy that could help our investigation . Agent Dunham ... My son went through something no child should ever have to go through . And when he came home , I had to ask him questions about it , going over the details again and again , forcing him to relive it , when all he wanted to do was forget . And for what ? I didn 't solve the case . And I didn 't help my little boy sleep at night . I 'm sure that you did your best , but if I spoke to him , maybe I could get more out of him . I 'm his father . Perhaps that 's the problem . Maybe there are some things that you don 't want to hear . Now , there 's something I want you to hear . My son 's condition since he was taken has deteriorated so rapidly that he 'll be lucky if he makes it to his 18th birthday . Now , what little childhood Christopher has left , I intend to protect it . I get that . But Christopher 's childhood is not the only one at stake right now . You 're dismissed . I don 't feel good . I want to go home . Through suffering comes redemption . Through sorrow comes exaltation . Through the pitch dark comes the cleansing fire , and through the fire , we shall find the spring of new life . ... Devotes his life to righting wrongs , protecting the innocent , and punishing the guilty . Cranston is known to the underworld as the shadow . Never seen , only heard , his true identity is known only to his constant friend and aide Margo Lane . Today 's story ... Hey . Hey . There 's been a police officer parked out front all afternoon . So it 's true ? The candy man 's back ? Yeah . Do you think he 'll try to come back here ? No . It 's just for my peace of mind . How 's Christopher ? He 's scared . The story about the missing boy 's been all over the news today . Did you eat ? Not since breakfast . Has there been any progress in the case ? No . One of my agents wanted to reinterview Chris ... Olivia Dunham . She thinks there may be some detail he 's forgotten . I told her it was a waste of time . I 've always liked Olivia . She seems very smart . I 'm gonna go put him to bed . He 's a strong boy , Phillip ... Strong enough to talk about it ... Even if you 're not . Thought you might be hungry too . Red vines ? They 're new . Charlie tried them . He said they 're great . Thanks . So after the victims were abducted , the kids came back with massive cell degeneration and internal-organ atrophy . All those conditions are symptomatic of old age too , right ? I suppose so . Why ? Well , aging has to do with the pituitary gland , right ? Which can be accessed through the back of the neck . Did you suddenly become a scientist when I was in the hospital ? You trying to take my job ? It was an old case that I worked before I joined Fringe division . This guy was draining hormones from pituitary glands . Anyway , my point is that some of the victims mentioned there were two suspects , one old and one young , but they all said that they never saw the suspects at the same time . Okay . Well , what if there weren 't two people ? What if there was only one person who was literally changing from old to young ? What if the candy man is stealing youth ? Okay . In theory , concentrated pituitary hormones could be processed in some way to accelerate healing , maybe even reverse aging , but if that 's true , it would also cause some serious side effects . Like what ? Anemia , tremors , hypoglycemia . High blood sugar ? High enough that he could secrete sugar in his sweat ? This is Dunham . Okay , I 'll be there . Thank you . What was that about ? It 's nice to see you again , Olivia . Chris is looking forward to meeting you . Here we are . Chris , agent Dunham 's here . Oh , uh , actually , " Olivia " is fine . It 's , uh ... it 's nice to meet you , Chris . Hi . Hi . Did you really save that school bus of kids from a class-three vortex last year ? Is it true ? Well , I was just doing my job . That 's so cool . So ... My mom says you want to talk about the man who took me . Yeah . Would that be okay ? Sure . Maybe we could talk somewhere else . Like , where is your favorite place to go ? Broyles . The candy man has had the boy for 36 hours . 12 hours left . How are we doing ? Nothing yet , but we 're working every lead we have . You 'll be happy to hear that you 'll have your team back together soon . Our Olivia 's mission on the other side is almost complete . We 'll be able to bring her home . And what about this Olivia ? Going to pull her out of the field tomorrow morning . I don 't believe we 'll be needing her anymore . Call me if you find anything . My dad says I need to forget about what happened . Yeah ? But it 's hard to forget , isn 't it ? You know , I can imagine what it must have been like for you ... How scared you must have been , how much you ... you would have wanted to get back to your family and to your friends . I-I have nightmares about it sometimes . Really ? Could you tell me about them ? I always remember the smell first . It 's musty , like our attic . He comes to the room wearing a mask to check on that thing stuck in my neck . It feels like ... It 's stealing my energy . I 'm so tired . I feel sick . Chris , you said that there were two men ... One old and one young , right ? Did they ever talk to you ? No . Nothing I remember . Chris ... What is it ? You can tell me . I know the candy man 's back . Yeah , he is . He said if I told anyone about him , he ... he 'd come back . He said this time ... He 'd ... he 'd hurt my mom and dad . That is not going to happen . I promise . Christopher , there is another little boy just like you . He 's been taken . And he wants to go home and see his family too . You can help him . I remember their voices . Um , they both said the same thing . I think it was a prayer . Can you remember the words ? Some of the words . " Through the pitch dark ... Comes a cleansing fire . " Okay . " Through the pitch dark comes a cleansing fire . " The words " pitch " and " dark " are common to several sacramental prayers from the early 20th century . Uh , the words appear in the liturgy of over a dozen churches in New York City . A dozen that we know of . Every time there 's another fringe event , a new church pops up . You know , I thought it was bad enough someone 's kidnapping kids . Now we find out he 's kidnapping kids for God ? Hi , honey . Mom , I collected some shells for you . They smell like the ocean . Thank you . Oh , looks like you brought half the beach back with you too . No , leave the sand . I like it . I 'll be right in . Broyles . He was very , very helpful . Thank you . Thank you . Come on . I want to wash the shells off . Okay . Bye , Christopher . Bye . Dunham . The boat 's called Sally . The red hook marina in Brooklyn ... " b " dock . Be there tonight at 10 : 00 , and I 'll get you where you want to go . Okay , I 'll be there . Dunham . Charlie got a hit on the prayer . They traced it to the astoria church in queens . " Through the pitch dark comes the cleansing fire . " Yeah . " And through the fire , you shall find the spring of new life . " It 's beautiful , isn 't it ? What does it mean ? I wasn 't always a man of the cloth . You know , I used to be a physician . And then the avian influenza epidemic came . My wife became ill . And despite all my training , there was ... There was nothing I could do to save her . Without her ... I was nothing . I was lost . But then God came and lifted me up , and ... and he showed me that what people need in these troubled times is ... is something to believe in . Faith ... that 's what 'll heal this wounded world . The prayer was spoken by the suspect in a kidnapping that we 're investigating . We believe the suspect is a member of your church . It will help our investigation if you would give us the names and addresses of all the men in your congregation . Giving out information on parishioners is ... is breaking the confessional seal . Reverend Marcus , I understand . I too am a man of faith . But right now there 's a child missing , and we need your help . We have a former victim who can identify the kidnappers ' voices . And you believe that this person is reliable ? He 's my son . Oh , I 'm sorry . I can get you the roster from our men 's group , if that 'll help . Thank you . There are over 40 names on this list . We 'll have to split up . Call Lincoln and Charlie . No , nothing yet ... Although this church is full of true believers . One guy actually told me that the reverend cured his kidney disease . So what about Charlie and Lincoln ? No luck yet . They 've interviewed seven men on the list , and none of them fit the profile . Okay , I 'm here . I 'll , uh ... I 'll call you in a bit . Wyatt Toomy ? Agent Dunham . I 'm with Fringe division . I need to ask you a couple questions in regard to an investigation . Can I come in ? Sure . Yeah . Saw him on the news . It 's real sad . You really think someone from the church may have taken him ? Possibly . Yeah . Excuse me for a moment . So did you meet reverend Marcus ? Yes . He is a miracle worker . Great man . Touched by God . Do you live here alone , Mr. Toomy ? Yep . Just me . Don 't move ! This is agent Dunham . I 'm at 1068 Kent street , apartment 5 . The suspect 's been sighted . I need backup now , please . Max . Hi . Uh , I 'm with the FBI . Are you okay ? Okay . Hey , you okay ? You sure ? All right . The paramedics took Max to the hospital . His mother 's gonna meet him there . The super said that Wyatt Toomy had been living here for almost nine years . Kept to himself , always paid his rent a week in advance . Hey . You guys should take a look at this . Have you figured out what he was doing ? We won 't know exactly until we get this back to the lab , but my guess is Olivia was right . About what ? Seems he was making some kind of age-regression serum . He was extracting hormones from the kids and giving them to himself . So your son was right . There was a young and an old suspect . It 's just they were the same man . This guy worked in sanitation . How 'd he figure out how to do all this ? All right , let 's bag and tag it . I won 't forget what you did here . Hey . When you 're done here , you want to join me and Charlie for a beer ? We get a lot of bad days . We got to celebrate the good ones . No , thanks . I 'm going home . Hey . You 're 19 minutes late . I had one more minute , and I was out of here . Wow , you really think this thing is gonna take us across the harbor ? Don 't worry about the boat . Worry about the patrols around that island . Hey , Henry , I know I 'm asking a lot of you . If you want to back out ... Come on . Let 's just get it over with , okay ? You want me to cast us off ? What ? Do you want me to untie the boat from the dock ? Oh , yeah , yeah . Do that . Yeah . Henry , you have done this before , right ? Want to know the truth ? Yeah . Water scares the hell out of me . Look , don 't worry . My cousin ran me through everything I need to know . We 'll be fine . Just do that ... that casting thing . What 's wrong ? Someone had to teach you how to do it . Yeah , so what ? I told you I 'm not a boater . Hey , hon . When you hear this , give me a call . I shouldn 't be here too much longer . Hey , I just left you a message . Hey . Uh , I think we were wrong . Wyatt Toomy was not a scientist . He needed someone to show him how to make the serum . Who ? Reverend Marcus . He said that he was a doctor . I think that 's how he 's been healing his congregation . He 's been dosing them . Wyatt was working for him . Dear God . Well , Christopher was right all along . There really were two suspects . I told reverend Marcus Chris could I.D. The voices he heard , and now my wife isn 't picking up the phone . Okay , I 'll meet you at your house . Henry , I gotta go do something . Can you promise me that you will wait for me ? Please ? Where the hell are you going ? You want to play hide-and-seek , young man ? I 'll find you . God wants me to find you . I 'm simply carrying out his plan . Take comfort , Christopher . You gave so much of yourself to help heal others . We all have to make sacrifices for the common good . No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Hey ! Let go of me ! Chris ! Dad . You 're safe , son . You 're okay now . Where are you ? It 's been an hour . What 's the deal with you ? I 'm leaving now . Just give me 15 minutes . Make it fast . I 'm starting to get seasick . Agent Dunham ? I thought that was you . Mrs. Clayton , how is Max doing ? Doctors think you got there just in time . Now , he hasn 't been able to stop talking about you . It 'd really mean a lot if you could say hi . Hey , Max , someone 's here to see you . Hi . Hi . How are you feeling ? Much better now . That 's good . You 're a real brave kid , you know that ? Well , not as brave as you . Can I ask you a question ? Sure . What 's FBI ? FBI ? Where 'd you hear that ? Well , you said it when you saved me . Remember ? You said you were FBI . Oh . FBI 's just another word for police . Well , then when I grow up , I want to be FBI too . That 'd be nice . Now , you should get some rest , because it 's late . Okay . Bye . Bye . How 's your wife and son ? They 're gonna be fine . In fact , the doctors are gonna take a look at the serum Wyatt Toomy was synthesizing . It may have some healing potential for Christopher and the other victims . Well , that 's great . Maybe some good could come out of all this . Dunham ... The FBI ceased to exist over a decade ago ... At least on this side it did . You know who you are , don 't you ? What happens now ? Now ... I 'm going home . Henry , don 't worry . Just stick to the same bearings on your way out , and you won 't run into any of their patrols . What makes you so sure ? 'Cause I memorized the routes when I escaped from there . How you plan on getting up there ? I 'll manage . Thank you ... For everything . Hey , I just borrowed a boat . No . You believed in me . You got me all the way the hell out here . You might as well tell me ... where is it you 're from ? I 'm from a parallel universe . Copy that . Yes . Sir , there 's been a security breach . Someone 's accessed the lab on Liberty Island . Ma 'am , what are you ... we 're ... we 're closed . I 'm sorry . I was just , uh ... Would you be able to let me out ? No , no . Please , this can 't be happening . Don 't hurt me . I 'm not gonna hurt you . I need you to listen very carefully . What I 'm gonna say is gonna sound insane , but I need you to do something for me . No ! No ! No ! Please . Please , I don 't belong here ! Sedate her . Oh , God ! Please let me go ! Who are you , really , and what were you before ? What did you do , and what did you think , huh ? We said , " no questions . " You know , I can turn it off if you want to go to sleep . I 'm just resting my eyes . Right . Otherwise known as sleeping . Oh , don 't you want to see how it ends ? I 've seen this movie about 100 times . You 're honestly telling me you 've never seen Casablanca ? I 've heard of it . It 's , uh ... it 's Ronald Reagan , right ? No . It 's Humphrey bogart . I was kidding . Okay , so let me guess . They , uh ... they end up running away together , and ... and they live happily ever after ? Actually , no . She leaves him at the airport , and they never see each other again . I thought you said it was a love story . Well , aren 't all the best love stories tragedies ? Only in the movies . Come on . Let 's go to sleep . Good night . Good night . Oh , you got to be kidding me . Hello ? Walter , is that you ? I can hear you breathing . Is this Peter Bishop ? Yes . I 'm calling from New York . I know this is gonna sound crazy , but I just saw a woman disappear in front of my eyes . Who is this ? Her name was Olivia . She has a message for you . She 's trapped in the other universe .

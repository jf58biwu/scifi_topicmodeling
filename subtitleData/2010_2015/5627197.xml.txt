 OLIVIA : Well , the story says that it started with three men ... Ablemarch , Costerdane and Frines . They formed an alliance . Oswald , I ... Run as fast as you can ! You 've got the most famous face on the planet . Where are you gonna hide ? From this moment on , Torchwood is defunct . You will be removed from American soil immediately and God help Great Britain . - Hey , stop . I said stop . - Go , just go ! - ( GUNSHOT ) - Jack ! REPORTER : Day 67 of the Great Depression . And the government has announced that all medical Overflow Camps will now stay open . Under the new emergency laws , Category 7 patients must be taken for disposal . Campaigners have called this institutional murder . ( TIRES SCREECH ) Go now or I will put a hole in your head . Can you spare me some of those metanec things ? - What ? - Metanec . Just a couple of boxes . My wife 's suffering something wicked with the arthritis , see . And she 's scared to go to the doctor 's because of the rumors . Well , they say Huw Jenkins has gone up in smoke and all he had was a bad back . Help yourself . Hurry up , we haven 't got long . Go , get out of here . - Oh , thank you . - Go . Come on , come on ! ( DISTANT SIRENS WAIL ) TV : Prime Minister , there 3 notes from members of the public ... OK , relax . She 's back . She 's only been for pizza . HEY Oh , beautiful . Nice one . Right ... That 's for the Reynolds and the Llewellyns . Oh , and , um , Iris Price called by . - Oh . - She was looking for painkillers . She gets a bloody headache and expects to go to the top of the list . Tell her she can have them if she pays double . - That 's the same policy as PhiCorp . - Thanks for that . Thanks a lot . Here we are . Careful now . Make yourself useful , you big lump . So , what did you get ? - Diamorphine . - That 'll do the trick . - Come on . - OK ? MARY : This won 't last a week the way he 's going through it . Don 't worry . I 'll get some more . ( SIGHS ) You OK , Dad ? You 'll be happy as Larry in a minute now . Smiling away . Poor sod . He 's missing his bed . - It 's too risky upstairs . - I know . But whenever we went away , the first night back he always used to say ... you can 't beat your own bed . Well , we can 't be too careful , Mam . It was only yesterday there was a raid on Oystermouth Road . They took two people away for the ovens . You know ? I used to arrest people for selling that stuff . It 's practically heroin . Strange days , sweetheart . It 's much better . - The infection 's almost gone . - ( SNORTS ) Yeah , the gunshot didn 't kill me . But I think you will . I 'll go into the village tomorrow , see if I can buy a steak , get you some iron . As long as they don 't start asking questions again . That last guy creeped me out . If he 's still there , I think we should move on . We 're in Scotland . - We can 't go much further north . - Yes , we can . Keep running for as long as it takes . I remember when you were too scared to leave home . Yeah , that was a long time ago . You were the strong one , standing tall . Look at you now . And now you 're a vampire . More like a gunsmith . Closest thing to a weapon we 've got . Esther , my blood isn 't magic . It didn 't make me immortal . They can 't have cloned it or copied it . All the same , Jack , they took your blood and they keep trying to spill your blood . Someone wants you dead for a reason . And I think this stuff 's the only hope we 've got . GWEN : The answer 's got to be here somewhere . The Blessing , page 56 of 12 million . God , I need Esther . I 've had a job offer ... driving for Matty Sheldon . Oh . Well , that 's good , isn 't it ? He 's got the contract for the Overflow Camps . I 'd be driving Category 1 s . Well , it 's not your fault . We need money . I won 't take them to the ovens , - just to the camps ... - I know , yeah . It 's funny , isn 't it ? When they first opened the camps , we all protested . Second time , we 're all too busy looking after ourselves . Aye . All part of the plan ... - ... to wear us down . - Yeah , but what is the plan ? What 's it all for , Rhys ? Oh , great . That 's just what I needed . That 's ... Bollocks ! You know ... those , um ... power cuts in the ' 70s ? Nine months later there was a baby boom ... cos people took advantage of the dark . - Well , you know ... - Yeah . Here , this could be the one piece of paper that we need . Come on , focus , people . Let 's go , come on . Let 's go ! Hey , you been here all night ? Don 't you have a home to go to ? Not any more . She left me , remember ? Oh , shit . - Yeah , sorry . - Cos of the hours which you imposed . I know . I forgot . But look , if you 're gonna be here anyway , why don 't you clean this place up a little bit , empty out some trash bins or something ? ( LAUGHS ) Really ? Sir , I should tell you that smoking is still illegal inside . It can 't kill you . Not any more . But they still haven 't changed the building 's insurance . Insurance companies went bust along with half the Western world . Oh , did I tell you ? Gas allowances have been halved . You are way over limit . Well , what do you expect me to do , walk to work ? Hey , don 't complain to me . Recession became depression . - We 're all being rationed , even the CIA . - OK , well , since you 're too busy housekeeping , then you probably won 't be interested in this . What is it ? A lead . All right , it 's 1928 and there 's a guy hanging in the cellar of the Giordano butcher shop and they 're selling tickets . For ... $ 2 you can watch him get killed and come back to life again . So who knows if it 's a miracle or he 's Harry Houdini ? Either way , it 's news , so plenty of people wrote about it . Yeah , but that 's where the records disappear . I 've told you , Ablemarch , Costerdane and Frines . They went through the archives , they scrubbed them clean . Look at this place , Rex . We have tried . According to the census of 1930 , the population of Manhattan was 1,867,000 . That 's more people than live there now . Allow for an average of two children per family , across three generations , by 2011 , we 're looking at a potential six million descendants . That 's six million suspects . We have to find and interview six million people . So do you see ? That proves my point . You 're looking too close at the facts . - What else should we be looking at ? - Fiction . Look , I 'll trade you six million people for one short story . Because the London office , they found a story . It was published in 1935 , The Devil Within . Now , it 's just pulp fiction , it 's all blood and Satan and that kinda shit , but it contains five points of reference identical to the Harkness case , which is more than a coincidence . Now ... I believe that the author was in that cellar . He saw Jack Harkness die , decided to write about it . And his name was ... Victor Podesta . Then we follow the Podesta family . Oh , sir , sir , this is ... this is where it gets interesting . You see , the Podestas owned a grocery store about ten blocks east of the butcher shop and they had connections to organized crime . Now , the youngest son ... john was stabbed to death back in ' 27 . Unsolved , mob-related . But check this out , now we jump to 1938 ... and the whole family just disappears I mean all of them ... Mom , Pop , Victor , daughter Emmeline . Just all gone . Well , look , maybe the Podestas changed their name . Who knows ? Maybe Emmeline married into the three families . We could look for a marriage license . And where would we check that ? Hmm ? - The Manhattan Central Repository ? - Damn it , every time . The most effective thing they did was burn that place down . Yeah , and that was 1965 . I mean , everywhere we turn , this conspiracy spans the whole of the 20th century . People , come on . This is me you 're talking to , remember ? You 're forgetting about the younger brother , the murder of john Podesta , unsolved . This is where we got lucky . The case was bagged , tagged and locked away , just sitting on a shelf collecting dust for almost 90 years . We still have the murder weapon . With blood on it ? Is that blood ? We have blood . We have DNA . - We can trace the family . - All right , everybody , let 's make a DNA profile and start looking for matches . Good job . Come on , let 's go . Let 's go ! REX : Group up , start working . - Uh , hey , Rex , um ... - Yeah ? I 've got Jordan and Carlyle . They were exceptional with the O 'Grady DNA , remember ? And they 're fast . - Want me to use them on this ? - Sure thing . Do what you 've got to do . Thank you for coming . This is not the promotion I expected , sitting in a nondescript office distributing for Harry Bosco . I thought you needed me . This is for you . - You 've been invited to Shanghai . - Well , that 's impossible . Don 't you watch the news ? First sign of the meltdown , China closed its borders . Not to us . This says Lucy Statten Meredith . You 'll be traveling under that name . In fact , that is your name from now on . But ... the families want to meet you ... in person . - It 's one-way ? - Yes . Yes , it is . I 'm rather jealous . They 're taking you to the Blessing . Thank you . We won 't meet again . Atishoo ! Atishoo ! We all fall ... ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) It 's them . ( WHISPERS ) They 're here . Remember , just do what we said . GWEN : Take it upstairs and flush it . Yes , I 'm coming ! If you don 't open the door , we 're legally empowered to knock it down . - Mrs Cooper ? - Mm-hm . You must be Gwen Cooper . Ralph Finch . Can we come in ? - Not without a warrant , no . - Oh ! Not necessary , I 'm afraid . I have reason to suspect you may be illegally harboring an unsupported Category 1 deceased person . And according to the Emergency Powers Act , reasonable suspicion is all I need . You keep an eye on the front . Gentlemen ! We 're in . Oh , I 'm gonna complain . I 'm gonna take this to the top . Just you wait and see , I used to be with the police . Yeah , very much in the past tense as I understand it . Up you go , boys . Check the rooms upstairs . My father is dead . He 's gone . We never said goodbye . No funeral . No chance to mourn him . For all I know he was just thrown into a furnace still alive . I can 't even have a bit of peace in my own bathroom ! Are you allowed to barge in - like this anyway ? - Husband , Rhys Williams . You never shared a surname , which says a lot . But we 're still missing one person . So , where 's Mary , Gwen ? - What 's keeping your mother so busy ? - ( GROANS ) Shopping ... ( FLICKING SWITCH ) - No lights ? - Uh , no . Whole house needs rewiring . No worries . We 've got torches . Boys ! Torches down here ! Lend us that , Joe . All that 's down there 's rats , so you make yourself at home . ( WHEEZING ) ( WHISPERS ) Shut up . ( VERMIN SQUEAK ) It 's mice , not rats . I 'd recommend putting down traps . We 'll get rid of the vermin ... as fast as we can . Out . Your father is still unregistered . And I can 't leave you alone until I know what happened to him . So ... you take care now . Seriously ... your whole family , you 'd better take a great deal of care . God , that was close . Never mind . I told you this thing would work . I had to ... I had to pin him down . ( WEEPS ) It took all my strength . It 's OK , Mam . It 's OK . They 've gone . OK ? They 've gone . Bad news . DNA trace , it came out negative . No leads , nothing . There 's no bloodline from john Podesta on file . I tried everything . - Shit . - Son of a bitch . Sorry . I 'll keep looking , but ... Hey , Charlotte ... the , um , Podesta short story , we have that on digital format , - right ? - Yeah , I think so . Why ? Great , can you send it to me ? It 's not worth reading . Like you said , pulp fiction . Yeah , I know , just send it to me . - You have an idea ? - No , no , no . Just send it , OK ? Sure . It 's the shopping . Take it through to the kitchen , will you ? - Eh ? - All right , mate ? Oh , you 're early . Just put it by the fridge , I 'll sort it out in a minute . It is posh getting deliveries , mind . Oh , it 's my mother 's latest scheme . She 's starting to cook for the club , raising money charging two quid a cake . Oh , isn 't she pretty ? Are you eating that food , honey , or are you wearing it ? Mm , sweet . So sweet ... your child . I realize this might be something of a surprise ... - but ... - What 's going on ? I 've been told that you have certain information that I need . ( CLEARS THROAT ) I apologize for the subterfuge , but I do happen to have the most recognizable face on the planet . Not any more ! - What the hell are you doing ? - Look at him , for God 's sake ! Look at him ! Look at him ! It 's Oswald Danes in our house . Oh , my God ! You touch my daughter again and I will kill you . Take her out of here , Mam , now . Good . Thank you . Cos I don 't want her to see her mother ... Stop it ! Stop . Stop . Stop . Stop it there . Hush now . Come on . We don 't want you arrested for murder . Thank you , sir . They can arrest me for that . Now you tell me . Tell me quickly , you bastard . You murdering bastard ! Eh ? Come on , tell me , before I get the boys round . Before I shout your name out loud in the street and fetch the bloody mob , tell me , what do you want ? Jack Harkness . The men who smuggled me into this country , they brought Harkness in seven weeks ago and they brought him to you . And then you , in turn , found him a haven . Now I paid good money for your name , Gwen Cooper , so I really need to see Jack . And you will do ... exactly what I ask . Why should I ? Because I have a name . ( LAUGHS ) I have the name of a man . I have the name of the man ... who created the miracle . Look , someone 's leaking information , you know that 's got to be true . Maybe not from here , but from somewhere down the chain . You know , for the past two months , every move we make , we get blocked . Yeah , well , I wish it were me . Then you could shoot me and I could sleep . - Yeah , I 'd like that very much , sir - So what did you find ? Victor Podesta . I figured anyone who writes pulp fiction is gonna want to keep on writing even if it 's under a different name . So ... I ran the short story through the pattern-recognition software , identifying key points of similarity - in prose styles . - Did you find him ? I found 320 . See , it 's more difficult with that sort of fiction because everyone writes the same . And that 's only the ones in the database . But ... out of that there 's around 46 with pronounced similarities scattered all across the world . Look at this ... 22 in the US , nine in the UK , one in Sweden . We 've got Argentina , Germany , japan . And I 've got to check them all out . Well , I think you 'd better get started . Yes , sir . But listen , can we keep this between you and me ? I mean , this has to be mine and mine alone , OK ? The , um , latest from the White House is that they 're gonna stop all immigration . China closed its borders , now we 're gonna do the same . Every passing day , we are taking one step closer to a dictatorship . And we don 't even know who the real dictators are . ( PHONE RINGS ) Hello ? GWEN : Can you see my car keys ? I can 't find them anywhere . - Um ... how did you get this number ? - Look ... whoever you 're working for , it 's Jack Harkness they 're after , so you 're wasting your time . He wouldn 't turn up here in a month of Sundays . $ 0 why not just take the night off ? Do you think we 're stupid ? JACK : Yeah . Now drink this . It won 't harm you . You 've had it before . - It 's true . I made you drink it . - I need you to have no memory of seeing me , so I can leave you with nowhere to put your hat ... or you can drink it . Option two 's better . GWEN : Oh , my God . Oh , my God . - Oh , my God . - I know . Oh ! - Sorry . - Oh , I know . - Hey , I thought you were better . - I 'm fine . I am , don 't worry . Thank you for looking after him . - Thank you . - It 's so good to see you . Oh , God , I missed you . I have so missed you . He 's through there . Jack ... I was told the correct form of address is Captain . You once asked me for help . So you can remember that , the rest of you - the Captain invited me in . I want to ask one thing first ... at your trial , you said about that girl , " She should have run faster . " Did you really say that ? Yes , I did . Right . OK . Cos let me tell you , Oswald , I used to be a policewoman and I worked with pedophiles and murderers , and God help me , I saw men so alone and ... and damned and ... wretched . But that 's not you . That 's ... That 's nothing like you . Because for the first time in my life I 've met a monster . Is that clear ? I feel very special . And well said . - I 'm gonna kill him . - Leave it . OK , everyone , all we need is information . Tell us what you know . And what happens to me after that ? Oh , then we kill you . And don 't forget , there 's no murder any more . So I can make you Category 1 for ever , pal . I haven 't agreed to anything . So you just tell me what you know or we are calling the police now . You 're keeping a few secrets yourself , Gwen . You had me tied up here all day , and all those whispers , all those looks towards ... that cellar . Are you hiding something down there by any chance ? Excuse me , you were gonna call the police . OK , there may be deals to be made ... There may not . But before we can decide anything , there needs to be a full and fair exchange of information . Mr Danes , there 's no going back . You need to tell us what you know . I 'll say this - PhiCorp gave me an assistant , a woman called Jillian Kitzinger , and in my crate over there I have Miss Kitzinger 's laptop . God 's sake , is that it ? ( LAUGHS ) We raided her file way back . Wait , wait . Wait , wait . As soon as I 'd stolen the laptop , good little Jilly did exactly the right things - she changed the passwords , opened new accounts , deleted the old ones . But I was watching . And I know my way around online better than most . I know how to keep myself hidden . So I shadowed her , and I 've been following Miss Kitzinger these past two months . Here 's a funny thing . Yesterday at 12 midday she disappeared . Her entire profile online vanished . Jilly Kitzinger ceased to exist . - You said you had the name of a man . - ( OSWALD SIGHS ) Soon as I say this , I 'll be at your mercy . - Yes . - Tell us his name ! I 'll have to trust you , remember that . I 'm trusting you . One man 's name keeps reoccurring . Kitzinger was employed to send him information . And his name 's Harry Bosco . Harry Bosco ? - His name , over and over again . - Esther ? Harry Bosco . - Sorry . - Why can 't you search him ? You think you 're clever , Oswald ? Is that really all you had ? It 's a name . Harry Bosco isn 't a man . Harry Bosco is a process . It goes back to Vietnam . It was the first war to be televised , and the government didn 't want US networks taking feed directly from the Vietnamese cos for the first time , information was beyond their control . So they put agents in every newsroom , every major TV network , filtering the output for the public . Cleverest of them all was a man called ... Harry Bosco . - What did he do ? - He 'd alter information . It was subtle . He did it by mistranslation . He couldn 't censor or change , but he could manipulate the English translation . Change one word , change the entire meaning . If you say " victims " instead of " bodies " , you influence public opinion . All the channels Harry Bosco these days . So that 's it ? Dead end ? Done ? You finished with him ? Can I have him now ? Could you keep your dog on its leash ? - Watch it , pal . - My point still stands . The name 's still important because Kitzinger works in PR . Why would she be handling this Harry Bosco process ? To be fair , it 's a good question . Why would the families hire Jilly to do all this in the first place ? - What 's she translating ? - What 's she mistranslating ? Cos the three families changed their name , now a Jilly 's changing words ? Maybe they 're connected . Chicken and chips . Didn 't have any fish . Too expensive . - World gone mad . - And I 've got the beers . - Can I have mine ? - Oh , sure . ( RHYS LAUGHS ) Hey ! They 've been going great guns , this lot . You know , going through someone 's e-mails , yeah , is like reading their diaries . - So what did we find ? - ( ESTHER SIGHS ) Another problem ... Jilly processed this clip from a local news station in Shanghai . It 's got three layers of language . It 's in the local Wu dialect dubbed into Mandarin and then she sent it out for English subtitles . How are we supposed to know what 's wrong or right ? - What ? Nobody speaks Chinese ? - Shut it ! What do we do ? I can 't go down to the takeaway and ask Kenny . Esther ? Yeah , I know . ( PHONE RINGS ) What ? Rex . It 's me . It 's Esther . Don ' 2' tell anyone , but ... I need your help . I 'm sorry , there 's no-one else I can turn to . - I 've got a lead . - All right , people , come on , I need this room . Top priority . Come on , clear the room . Let 's go , let 's go , let 's go . Where are you ? Can 't say , so don 't make me . We 're safe . We 're fine . We 're OK . Well , if that 's the plural , I take it that World War I ! Didn 't die . It 's going to take more than that ! I 've been trying to kill the silly sod for years . OK , so that 's Gwen , which means you 're in Wales . $ 0 much for undercover work . You / mom you 're idiots . [ didn 't even have to trace you . Except you 're not tracing us anyway , are you ? No , I 'm not . We need help , Rex . We need the CIA . We need translations specifically . Oh , Shit . Um ... OK , I 'll try . - Can 't tell them why . - Oh , I know , believe me This place isn 't safe . What 's the language ? Mandarin . We think there 's something in Shanghai . Morning . Guess you 're my breakfast meeting . I 'm Jilly Kitzinger . No , you 're Lucy Statten Meredith . Congratulations , you failed the test . OK , I keep wondering , why me ? You 're a storyteller . - Thank you . - Look at you ... the nails , the coat , the lipstick . From the moment you walk through the door , you tell a story . You might have noticed we 're kind of good at keeping quiet . So we need you . We need experts . So what 's your story ? I 'm the latest chapter in an epic . Once upon a time , there were three wise families . And they went out into the world . One family took politics , one family took finance and one family took media . But ... that 's all in the past . The stories yet to come , they 're the best . So does that mean there 's a story about to break ? With the miracle ? Not for me to say . You want me to what ? Prepare a statement ? Mount a campaign ? That 's kind of small , don 't you think ? Then what ? We need you to write history . I could do that . Good . Nice recovery . Your hair is a work of art . If you ever come here at night , try the mitten crab . It 's a local delicacy . So what do you want me to do next ? Stay in your hotel and wait . When we 're ready , you 'll be taken to the Blessing . I hope you survive . I 'm sorry ... what do you mean by that ? Well , some people die . The Blessing , it kills them . Good luck . You won 't see me again . ( DUBBED MANDARIN ON SOUNDTRACK ) This is pre-miracle . He died two days later . But he went crazy , burned down a hospital , got caught in his own fire . - This guy should win the Darwin Award . - " Godsend " , - you got that ; Rex ? - Yeah , yeah . I saw it first . I knew it . The English isn 't " godsend " . The actual phrase is " It 's a blessing my life was saved . " ALL : " Blessing . " It doesn 't mean anything . We 'd all say that . He survived a fire . REX : Hold on , hold on , hold on . Would somebody shut the husband up , please ? That 's the Mandarin , but the original Wu dialect is different . Are you ready for this ? He didn 't say , " It 's a blessing my life was saved . " He said , " The Blessing saved my life . " They mistranslated it on purpose . " The Blessing saved my life . " It 's in Shanghai . - The Blessing 's in Shanghai . - How the hell do we get to Shanghai ? Oh , for God 's sake ! You 're not serious ? Well ... they hid the word " Blessing " , Rhys . It wasn 't hidden from the bloody Chinese ! They saw it and there 's enough of them ! But it was only transmitted once and then it was scrubbed off the record . Yeah , just because he said " Blessing " doesn 't mean it 's in Shanghai ! I mean , I could say " Jesus " , but I 'm not in Jerusalem . Why did they hide that clip ? Now , stop it . Hush , OK ? Just for a minute . The trouble is , getting into Shanghai is going to be impossible . They 've closed the borders , withdrawn from the UN . I mean , the whole of China is a no-go area . Yeah , and there 's no way I can get in without posting it as a full-scale mission , and that 's going to leak . By the time we ' d get there they 'd be gone . - You could take a slow boat . - Shut it ! Wait a minute , who was that ? - Who else is there ? - Just ... just Rhys . Never mind . Esther , is there anything within mainland China ? Any open ports ? Anything ? No , but ... wait . I knew a man once , way back , um , worked out - of Hunan Province . - ESTHER : Wait , wait , wait , just listen . OK , think about it , who burns down a hospital ? I mean , who does that ? Why would he do that ? Turns out we 've got another mistranslation . The Mandarin says " medical facility " , but I looked up the address . It was a blood bank . Blood again . - It 's always about blood . Why is that ? - Wait , wait , wait . OK . Run a check on that , but reference it with Kitzinger . She has a second clip in Span / sh . It 's ... There 's a second blood bank in Buenos Aires , a blood bank destroyed by fire 24 hours before Shanghai } five days before the miracle Wait a minute . Wait a minute . I had Argentina . Right there . John Forester , died age 76 in La Boca . I think he was in the cellar with Jack . But that man said , " Miracle in Shanghai , " yes ? Then Why 'd they burn down a blood bank in Buenos Aires ? I mean , why burn down a blood bank at all ? We don 't even know what the Blessing is . Maybe it 's some sort of ritual . Maybe it happens in both cities at once Whoa , hang on a minute . ( SHOUTING ) ( WHISPERS ) Rhys , my dad ! Hello ? - Hello there , Gwen . - Hello . Got company ? Yeah , we 're just visiting from London . Don 't worry , anyone who can leave the house under their own steam is of no interest to me . What 's going on ? Been busy down there , Rhys ? No . Well , you won 't mind if I take a look , then . In the old days , to find a dead body you 'd use a sniffer dog . But they 've gone the way of the miner 's budgie . ( CHUCKLES ) Brand new app - thermal imaging . Brilliant , it is . - Sony , hold up there . - This is my house . My name is Mary Cooper and I live here . For God 's sake , let me in ! This is good . I 'm the most wanted man on the face of the Earth , but they want someone else . Yeah , one more word out of you - and I 'm handing you over . - But you can 't . Because then they 'll wonder who you are . We 've got him ! Over there , boys . Behind the wall . Pull it down . He 's not dead ! He 's not dead . Feel him , he 's still warm . - He 's ... He 's ... He 's warm . Feel him . - Not as warm as he 's going to be . Oh , you bastard ! Please don 't , OK ? Please don 't ! - This man is Category 1 . - Please , please ! It 's my duty to take him from this place and deliver him into safe keeping until such time as he can be disposed of according to the laws of the land . ( WHISPERS ) Please don 't . I 'm sorry for your loss . Good bye , my love . - What do you want to do ? - Go to Shanghai . I don 't care if we have to walk . I will travel the whole bloody world to put this right , Jack . I need your permission to go off grid , sir . Failing permission , I 'm going anyway . And I need to go now . OK . What if you need backup ? Well , then and only then will I contact you , sir . Minimum notice . Because if we 've got a mole , I can 't risk anyone finding this out . But this could be it , sir . This could be the Blessing . Good luck . I think I can get us in . Back in the old days , Torchwood tracked down a black-market trade in alien artifacts coming out of China . Skullion metal and coins , things like that . We closed it down , but the route stayed open ... for arms dealing . - We 're going to trust arms dealers ? - I don 't care . I 'll do it . OK , OK , wait . What about Buenos Aires ? - I don 't know . Which city is it ? - RHYS : It 's both . You bunch of ... nuts . You can 't see for looking , can you ? Eh ? Look . Right , Shanghai ... ( WHISTLES ) ... Buenos Aires . Buenos Aires ... ( WHISTLES ) Shanghai . Opposite sides of the world . Quite literally , opposite sides of the Earth , yeah ? Yeah ? So whatever 's going on , there 's got to be - something connecting them . - Oh , my God , are you kidding me ? Is that right ? They 're antipodes . They 're the antipodes of each other . Two massive population centers balanced on either side of the planet . As the old saying goes , " Count your blessings , " cos it turns out there 's two of them . - But what does it mean ? - Look at the PhiCorp logo . The letter Phi , circle with a line through it . It 's been right there in front of us , staring us in the face all this time . A line through the world ? The Blessing . The miracle . - Mm-hm . - But what is it ? We need to find out . We can get into Argentina , no problem . Maybe we need to get into both , Jack . - Maybe you should go one way ... - And you the other . Buenos Aires . Shanghai . So this is what we 're doing ? A mission on both sides of the world ? - Biggest mission yet . - Suppose it is , yeah . And you 're taking me with you . - GWEN : No way . - RHYS : No , no , no . I 've got better plans for you , bub . And that 's your problem , isn 't it , Gwen ? You can 't let me walk free , not a man with my desires . And you can 't have me arrested . Not now that I know all about your little plans . - They can leave you here with me . - Well , that 's just it , you joyous man , you 've just trapped your wife completely . Leave me here with him and I think he would , I actually think he would . Your husband would kill me . He 'd make me Category 1 with his own bare hands . You would kill me , wouldn 't you ? Yeah ? Is that what you want ? No . I 'm coming with you . There 's no choice . There 's not a choice in the whole of the world . ( SPEAKS MANDARIN ) ( MAN CONTINUES TO SPEAK MANDARIN ) JACK : Hup ! Let 's go ! - ( SIGHS ) It made it . - Yeah . The only way to get this stuff through was in a diplomatic bag . Oh , man . Don 't start with that hugging shit . Shut up . Come on . Look , the only problem is I had to sign for the case . Now , I 'm running this thing undercover , but if anyone checks the embassy notifications ... we 're screwed . ( BEEPING ) You must feel terrible . No , I 'm fine . No , I mean , you really must . That 's what the Blessing does to you , the closer you get . You 're scared . Am I right ? Your skin 's a little too tight . There 's something just out of the corner of your eye you can 't quite see . Hmm ? Yes . You never get used to it . Come this way , Miss Kitzinger . It 's Miss Meredith . I don 't really care . The men enjoy those sorts of games . But the feeling , it started as soon as we dug deep enough . I think it 's the Blessing 's attempt to communicate . Then it 's a living thing ? Oh , we have no idea . But certainly the Blessing sends some sort of impact back at the onlooker . We have a theory . We say the Blessing shows you to yourself . I 've seen people look upon the Blessing and end their lives . There 's a brilliant truth about that , because each and every time , that person was hiding something vile . Isn 't that wonderful ? It 's exhilarating , the damage it does . I wonder what you 'll see . What can you see ? What does the Blessing tell you about yourself ? That I 'm right . How far down does it go ? All the way to the other side of the world . Uh ! ( PHONE RINGS ) Hey . Guess what . Same old glamor here . We 're in some kind of warehouse . Yeah ? Well , I 'm stuck in a hovel owned by gunrunners , with Oswald Danes as a roommate . Not the best day of my life , I 'll tell you . Still , it 's a good phone line . Yeah , considering the distance , it is . Just started looking for that Blessing . God help us we 're in two of the biggest cities on Earth . Try starting with the family of that arsonist and I 'm going to go to local libraries . You look after that weapon , OK ? Jack 's blood has got to be important . - It 's safe . Got it here . - Find anything , call me . You too . Good luck . Bye . Oh ! Idiot . You idiot . You told me that was healed . You 're not better at all , are you ? - Let me see . - Sorry . It 's OK , I got it . OK , I got you . - I got you ... - Oh ! JACK : I 'm so sorry . Don 't be sorry . Don 't be sorry , I 've got you . OK ? Let me take a look . Oh , honestly ! Oh , God . Gwen ... If I had known it was this bad , Jack , you 'd never have come . It got worse when we arrived . - Ah ! - Oh , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . OK , I got you . Fine place to die , in old Shanghai . You 're not dying . Don 't say that . I 'm tired , Gwen . This mortal life ... it hurts so much . OSWALD : Well , now . Can 't say I 've been to China before , so I 'm not well versed in their customs . But ... I 've got to say ... I never knew about that . OSWALD : Whoa . Whoa , whoa , whoa . It 's your blood . No wonder it 's killing you . I think ... I think it 's showing us the way ! It 's the Blessing . It 's somewhere over there . And I think , whatever it is , it 's calling you , Jack . We 've changed the whole of the world and this is just Phase One . MAN : These are the days of the miracle . It 's like they broke the world . Why would you want this ? WOMAN : We tear down in order to rebuild . Somebody betrayed us . JACK : The world 's been turning for ... Over four billion years ... I 'll see you . So much buried under its skin . GWEN : What the hell is that thing ? WOMAN : You 're about to meet the creator . OSWALD : Who are you ? I come from the future . Then you must know . Do we make it through this day ?

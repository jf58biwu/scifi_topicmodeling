 Coulson : Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... - You were dead for ... days . - Simmons : " GH-325 . " Agent Coulson was injected with that , and literally minutes later , his wounds showed signs of cellular regeneration . I 'd like to turn the machine on again . It induces Theta brain-wave frequencies to help uncover the secrets buried in the subconscious . Please ! Let me die ! - When did you start doing this ? - First night I saw Garrett 's writings . - What do you think caused it ? - The GH-formula . This is what you 've been doing up here . It 's what I did yesterday . No matter how much I carve , it still means nothing to me . - I don 't even have a theory . - I do . It 's a map . You 're being transferred . Your brother wants you in his custody . [ bone snaps ] 2x07 - The Writing on the Wall Burning man , two years ago , we were stuck in the desert ... on a glow-in-the-dark bus . - Is that it ? - What 's burning man ? [ laughing ] Oh . Are you sure you 're not from Iowa ? Because you just sounded like it . - Baltimore , born and raised . - This is gonna drive me nuts . [ chuckles ] I mean , it 's crazy , right ? [ laughs ] We see each other from across the bar , and ... we just wave at each other like we 're long-lost friends . [ wine pouring ] [ bottle thuds ] I know I know you . I just can 't figure out how . To remembering . [ glasses clink ] - So , you 're an artist . - Mm , yeah , I do some painting . And I teach community art classes . [ gasps softly ] Is that how I know you ? - Are you an artist ? - I do some carving now and then . [ chuckles ] Well , maybe the reason we think we know each other is because it was our destiny to meet tonight . Look ... I haven 't been entirely honest with you . We have met before , and I 've traveled a long way to be with you . Okay . Maybe we should just slow this down . No . We share so much ... so many memories ... so much pain . [ gasps softly ] How ... how ... how do you know about that ? I 'll help you remember . [ screams ] [ up-tempo jazz music playing ] [ knife snaps ] [ grunts ] Damn it . [ music stops ] How long were you standing there ? Long enough . May gave us specific instructions ... you go on a date with the crazy wall , I have to chaperone . I didn 't want to wake you . Do I look like I 've been sleeping ? [ knife clicks ] - What 's keeping you up ? - It 's all connected ... everything . Ward has information about my father , who just happens to have the alien buzzkill device , which is somehow connected to the writing , that is related to the G.H. serum that is in our blood ... like we 're pieces to a puzzle . Except we don 't know what the puzzle is or how the pieces even fit . [ sighs ] It 's a hacker 's worst nightmare , everlasting gobstopper of firewalls . It wants us to know . I can feel it . Then it ... should tell us , because I have been trying to match the writing to constellation maps , navigational charts , genome diagrams . And if it 's a map , it 's a map to nowhere . I need you to stick with it . The writing 's coming more and more frequently . Used to be two , three times a month . Then once a week . Now it 's every day , every night . [ breathing heavily ] I can 't turn it off . How do you function ? When do you sleep ? That 's why we need answers . And what if we don 't find them ? Anything else ? [ breathing heavily ] When does May get back ? [ knife clicks ] Not until we find Ward . [ breathing heavily ] Morse : This is Morse . I have agents positioned at multiple locations . - We have been sitting here for an hour . - May : He has 11 hotboxes within 200 miles of his last known position . Odds are , he 'll show up at one of them . Why isn 't there a nationwide manhunt ? He escaped from federal custody . Senator Ward is covering it up . No one 's looking but us . Triplett here . I 've got eyes on the prize . I 've got a clear shot and a trigger finger that needs some love . No . Stand by and wait for your orders . [ locker opens ] Director , say the word . I can end this . - The senator wants him alive . - What do you want ? Bring him in ... by any means necessary . Copy that . Damn . I don 't know how , but he knows we 're on him . He 's got a dead man 's switch and enough C-4 to take down the block . Man on P.A. : Bus 741 to Atlanta now boarding . He 's on the move . Do not engage . He 's not bluffing . Keep an eye in the sky , May . Have Agents Hunter and Morse in position at the next stop . If we can 't bring him in , at least we can see where he 's going . We found Ward . - What ? - One of my sources , this guy micro ... he 's kind of a crime-scene junkie ... he came across something . The writing , but not exactly how we wanted to see it . - When were these taken ? - Last night . Whoever did this is still out there . - This is the victim ? - Janice Robbins . Lives ... lived in upstate New York . - She 's a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent . - No , she 's an art teacher from Iowa . - I have her full bio . - I 'm not wrong . I 've seen her . We should check it out . You know we 're breaking about 14 laws right now . [ sighs ] One of the perks of being outlaws . This had to happen on my shift ? You couldn 't wait till May got back ? May 's got her hands full with Ward . And we 're the only ones who know what we 're looking for . - What are we looking for ? - Answers . [ sarcastically ] You 're right . This place just screams S.H.I.E.L.D. agent . You two don 't have a single thing in common , unless you have some Enya albums you 've been hiding . No . Nothing in common at all . I take that back . There 's a lot of overlap . We were definitely working on the same design , but she has some pieces I was missing . How does the carving we found in Miami fit into this ? [ sighs ] Whoever did it was on our wavelength . [ sighs ] There 's just a few pieces missing . It 's almost there . You were right . She 's a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent . Agent Rebecca Stevens , level 6 . Stationed at the Triskelion . - That 's probably where I saw her . - Not recently , you didn 't . According to this , she died five years ago from cancer . How is that possible ? We won 't know until we perform an autopsy . Don 't you need a body for that ? [ grunting ] [ body thuds ] How 'd you two manage to acquire a body ? " Corpsey diem " ... seize the dead . Huh . Like I told my man here , you want something in life , you got to grab it and walk out like you own it . Is that all it takes ? Really ? Because I always thought if you wanted something in life , you had to work hard and earn it . Give me some room , please . [ exhales sharply ] - Does she have any family ? - No one . No relatives , no kids . - She didn 't deserve this . - Is anything coming back to you ? She was level 6 . It should all be in my head . But it 's not . We 're going to need blood and tissue samples , full CBC , and multi-element analysis . Would anyone like to leave before we get started ? We 'll stay out of your way . I 'll let you know when I finish . - Need some help with those ? - I 'm okay . It 's no problem , really . I promise ... I don 't bite . - I 'm Zack . - Eliza . This is Graham . Hey , Graham . So ... want to give me a hand with this ? - Sure . - Alright . [ grunts ] Looks like you don 't need my help after all . Graham here is doing all the heavy lifting . You mind if I tag along with you anyway ? Where you heading ? - Dallas . - Must be fate . Here you go , sweetie . Thank you . You 're a real savior . - Join us for the ride ? - I prefer the back . [ sighs ] Excuse me . Is that seat taken ? - All yours . - Thanks . [ engine turns over ] Don 't like to fly , huh ? - Excuse me ? - I never understood why people would take the bus when they can fly . Says the man on the bus . Uh , last-minute trip . Didn 't have a choice . - You here by choice ? - Oh , I like the scenery . Can 't see the world with your head in the clouds . Can 't see it with your face in a book , either . It 's a long trip . There 's plenty of time for everything . Well , you could just skip to the end . - And miss all the good parts in between ? - Can 't be that interesting . Why do you say that ? Because you were on page 117 when you were waiting outside . And you 're still on page 117 . So either you 're a really slow reader ... - or you 're working for Coulson . - Who ? [ chuckles ] I am impressed . You can tell him I said that . - I almost missed you . - What are you talking about ? I 'm sure they told you about this . If you try or say anything ... everyone in this bus will be flying . So , just keep reading your book and hope for a happy ending . [ doors close ] - Driver . - Yes , sir ? I 'm on the wrong bus . Guess I , uh ... need to pay closer attention to things . [ doors open ] Sorry . Had to get rid of some excess baggage . You were right , May . He 's good . Very good . Hunter , if you 're in position , he 's all yours . [ Southern accent ] Copy that , darlin ' . Happy to oblige . The cuts were all quite deep , but the cause of death was cardiac arrest . She died from shock due to the pain , not from the wounds . Very common in this type of ritualistic murder . - Ritualistic ? - It has all the characteristics . The cuts are very precise , and the killer continued to carve on her long after she died , as if there were some need to complete the work . My hunch is that it wasn 't the first time , either . It 's also not the first time we 've seen these carvings . They 're the same ones Garrett was making , correct ? Dr. Simmons , here are the reports you requested . Thank you . - It 's the analysis from the subjects . - Subjects , plural ? [ sighs ] We found blood and tissue samples from a secondary source under her nails . She put up a fight . Oh , no . Just as I suspected . - She had GH-325 in her blood . - A Tahiti patient . Whoever killed her also had GH-325 in their blood . Don 't look at me . I didn 't do it . No , of course , but you both had GH-325 injections . Hypergraphia was one of the side effects they tried to treat with memory replacement . Garrett suffered from it . Apparently , so does our killer , and they both turned into dangerous psychopaths . Have either of you been experiencing a compulsion - to write or carve ? - We 're fine . But somewhere out there is a Tahiti patient who may be targeting all the others . We need to find him . The patient files were all destroyed . - How would anyone be able to locate them ? - I don 't know . - How many Tahiti patients were there ? - I don 't know . Do you think the killer will come after the two of you ? I don 't know . If you don 't know anything , then how are we gonna find them ? You 're gonna have to torture it out of me . - Is all this really necessary ? - If you 're going to insist on doing this , I 'm going to be monitoring you very closely . It took me and Fitz six weeks to figure out how to operate this , and quite honestly , I never thought we 'd have to use it . We should have destroyed it . In the history of bad ideas , this is light-years ahead of everything . No , trying to bring dead agents back to life using alien blood blows everything else away . They buried those memories for a reason , Coulson . They were driving people insane . And now you want to uncover it when you 've been getting worse . - May would never ... - May 's not the director . This is my call . I was put in charge of the Tahiti project , so those people are my responsibility . If going back in this machine saves even one life , then it 's worth the risk . [ breathing rapidly ] Stealing bodies , talking about aliens , and bringing the dead back to life . What kind of creature feature did I sign up for ? - Coulson lost his ... - Marbles ? Mind ? No , memories . The machine helps him find them . Mack , I need you close just in case . - In case ... ? - In case he starts screaming and you need to hold him down . [ sighs ] Okay , try to stay relaxed . Listen to my voice . I 'll guide you through , but at the first sign of any duress , I 'm pulling you out . No , not until we have everything we need to find this guy . All systems are go . Concentrate on Agent Stevens . She 's your access point . Focus on her . All right . Take him back . [ machine humming ] [ exhales heavily ] [ echoing ] What do you see ? Where are you ? The guest house ... - in the interview room . - D-Do you recognize anyone ? I 'm alone . Concentrate on Agent Stevens . - How do you feel today ? - Terrific . I 've never felt better . Do you remember how you got here ? I volunteered . I was dying , and ... when I woke up , everything was okay . She 's here . She 's doing well . And the others ? How many are there ? Thank you , Agent Coulson , for all your help . I 'm ready to get back in the field . - I-I can 't believe this actually worked . - I feel great . It 's a new day . How long are you keeping me here ? Six patients , well-adjusted . I 'm recommending immediate release . [ marker squeaking ] His heart rate is spiking . [ grunts ] What 's happening , Coulson ? I see the writing ... for the first time . Something 's happening to them . [ speaking gibberish ] [ laughs ] [ groans ] [ speaking gibberish ] I want to get out of here ! I want to get out of here ! [ overlapping screams , gibberish ] [ laughs ] [ screaming , crying ] [ screaming fades ] How long are you gonna keep me here with these lunatics , Coulson ? [ monitor beeping rapidly ] Vital signs elevating . [ grunts ] Tell me what 's going on , Coulson . Degenerative effects . They 're unstable . [ echoing ] They 're getting worse every day . They 're getting worse every day . We 're losing them . We need to shut down the program . This isn 't a failure , Agent Coulson . It 's a first step . - We rejuvenated life . - This isn 't life . We need to shut it down and destroy the host . You can 't do that ! It 's thousands of years old , pre-dating the pyramids ! We haven 't even scratched the surface of the benefits . These are human beings , not lab rats ! I 'm contacting Fury . There 's still hope for them . The host 's genetic material may be implanting its own genetic memories onto theirs , creating the psychic schism . If we were to completely wipe away all their memories ... Erase their minds ? That 's hope ? We can give them new memories , new identities . They 'll never be agents again , but they 'll be able to lead normal , healthy lives . Let me die ! Man : No , stop ! Please ! No ! Please , will you make it stop ? Please , make it stop ! Aah ! [ gasping ] Please , somebody ! Somebody stop it ! Stop doing this , please ! [ screaming ] What have we done ? What have we done ? [ monitor beeping rapidly ] What have we done ? - What did you do ? Tell me . - We erased them , all of them . New names , new memories ... it was the only way . You did the right thing . Can you find their new names ? - Uh , how much more can he take ? - I don 't know . Whatever you 're doing to him , you need to stop ! Coulson , we need their names . Find their names so we can pull you out ! [ grunting ] Lewis Seaver . That 's one . That ... That 's one . That 's ... K-keep them coming . Keep them coming . [ normal voice ] Looks like the big , bad wolf is stopping for a pint . [ mid-tempo music playing ] I 'll give you a choice . Colombian necktie ... or bullet in the head . [ chuckles softly ] Bullet in the head ... on the rocks . [ bottle thuds ] On the house . Welcome back . [ car doors close ] Hello . May , we have a problem . Grant Ward . [ door closes ] In from the cold at last . Mr. Garrett spoke quite highly of you . Imagine my surprise when I received your call . I wasn 't even aware that phone was active ... or you , for that matter . - We thought you were dead . - Not dead . Waiting . I was locked in a cage . Before that , I was trapped behind a S.H.I.E.L.D. badge . - Now I 'm finally free . - How can we help you ? Since strucker is overseas , I assume you report to someone else . - That 's correct . - I want a meeting . Though we do appreciate your talents and your loyalty , - Mr. Whitehall is a very busy man . - Will his schedule open up if I can get you face-to-face with Coulson ? Close enough to put ... a bullet in his head . May : Skye ? Coulson ? ! Anyone . - When the cat 's away ... - Keep trying to reach them . I 'm taking us down . The body of Lewis Seaver was found in the remains of the Santa Maria church fire in Miami . Coulson : In the fire was this guy too . Three of the others died of unnatural causes in the last six weeks . This guy is definitely targeting Tahiti patients . - Is there still a chance ? - Two of them are alive . We need to find out which one is the killer . Do you remember anything , a-any clues ? [ groans ] Carver : Stay out of my head , Coulson . There 's nothing wrong with me . - Roll up your sleeves . - You don 't need to erase me . [ grunting ] There 's nothing wrong with me . You 're not okay , and it 's only gonna get worse . - But I can help you . - No ! It 's the only way to know ! You ... you can 't erase me , Coulson ! Don 't do this to me , Coulson ! I need to know ! I need to know ! No ! You can 't erase me ! I need to know what it means ! It wants me to know ! I need to know ! It wants me to know ! I need to know ! I need to know ! I need to know ! No ! No ! - I need to know ! I need to know ! - Get him the hell out of there ! - Shut it down ! Shut it down ! - I need to know ! - Sedate him ! I 'm calling May . - I ... - I got Skye . - Skye ? We have a Ward situation that 's about to get really bad for all of us . Coulson went into the memory machine . - What ? ! And you let him . - It wasn 't my call . Lock him up and keep him under - observation until I get back . - What the hell is going on ? Let 's just stay focused . Coulson : [ grunting ] I need to know . I need to know ! - What did you do to him ? - Just hold him down . [ grunts ] Skye : Coulson ? ! Don 't make me use this . [ panting ] - I 'm sorry . - I spoke to May . She wants us to lock you up until she gets back . [ panting continues ] I think that 's a good idea . [ door closes ] His name was Sebastian Derik . He was an assassin from the dark side of S.H.I.E.L.D. How many others did you say are still alive ? Just one ... Hank Thompson . He only lives a few hours away from here , so I 'll send some agents to protect him . [ device beeping ] That won 't be necessary . [ gasping ] [ beeps ] - Aah ! Coulson ... - Sorry . - I need to take care of him personally . - Coulson , you 've got ... [ beep ] [ silent ] [ birds chirping ] [ dog barking ] [ train howls ] Hey , you want to slow down that train , buddy ? [ chuckling ] You want to see them crash , don 't you ? [ boy chuckles ] I fear for the world the day you get your driver 's license . Hank , there 's someone up at the house that wants to see you . - Is it a customer ? - Says he 's an old friend ? Okay , I 'll be right there . [ gunfire ] I 've seen some messed-up stuff in my day , turbo , but nothing quite like that . [ explosion , gunfire continues ] Holding down the director like he 's possessed ... Yeah , well , what happened ... that 's not ... - wasn 't his fault . - I know . Someone jumbled his memories . No , his memories weren 't jumbled . They were ... replaced . - Just some of them . - You 're up . - No , I 'm okay . - Nah , come on . It 's good for you . Helps your brain and hands learn to get their act together . Replaced memories , jumbled memories ... how the hell is he supposed to keep everything together ? What if he forgets what team he 's on ? You know , I like my bosses un-jumbled at all times . Yeah , he is , or he will be . He 'll recover . He did before . Besides , brains never delete files . They just lose connections . But there 's always a backup . Just a matter of digging and finding them . - So , you 've got backup files , too ? - Has anyone seen Skye ? Oh , no . Guys ... quick . [ door opens ] [ beep ] ... you been ? It 's about time ? - Coulson did this to you ? - You think ? - Simmons : Is he going after the killer ? - Not the killer . [ knock on door ] - Can I help you ? - My name is Phil Coulson . You don 't remember me , but we 've met . It 's very important that we talk . - This isn 't a good time . - You need to listen to me . Look , I have no idea who you are or what you want , but you need to leave . - Mr. Thompson ... Please . - Look . Okay , you have something to say , you can say it out here . I have every reason to believe that your life is in danger . Is your family home ? - No . - That 's good ... because I need to pick your brain . No one 's been in or out since the party started . - You 're sure no one saw you ? - I didn 't blow my cover . - You suggesting I did ? - Hunter : It 's okay , it happens . What did you do , come on too strong ? Subtlety is key . You were dressed like a cowboy . - I ... - Enough . There 's a good chance Ward 's wearing his ka-boom box . If we can 't get a fast , clean shot , he could take the whole building down with us inside . We don 't have the resources for this . We should call in outside reinforcements . No , if Ward saw them coming , - he 'd take them all down with him . - So , what 's the plan ? Get a fast , clean shot . I don 't want to hurt you , but you need to listen to me . - You were an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. - Please , just go . - Do you recognize these symbols ? - No , no , I don 't . - Look , is that all you need ? - Think . Have you been drawing , carving , painting , anything that reminds you of these ? I have never seen them in my life . Look at them ! Try to remember . I need to know what this means . You have pieces that I need ! I don 't know what you 're talking about , and I don 't care . Look , I 've told you both , you 've got the wrong guy ! Both ? Someone got here before me ? [ thud ] [ clank ] [ door hinges creak ] Is he dead ? [ kick thuds ] [ gasping ] [ grunts ] I 'd be very quiet if I were you . [ door hinges creak ] [ lock clicks ] Agent Coulson , I 've got bad news . The lunatics are running the Asylum . Do you remember me , Coulson ? - Do you remember what you did to me ? - I tried to help you . What , by erasing my memories , trying to change who I was ? It was the only way to save you . It didn 't work . You want to know why ? Because I discovered a little secret . Pain made me remember . [ groans ] I found out after I started cutting myself . The more pain , the more I remembered . That 's how I found the others you erased . I remembered who they were and who they became . [ grunts ] [ gasping ] I came for you first , Coulson , but you were already dead . Yet here you are . Why is that ? [ breathing heavily ] Are you one of us now ? Why ? Why would you do that ... - when you know what it does ? - I didn 't . I think it 's because ... you wanted to know the answer to this . Look , I tried to help the others remember . I cut and I cut , but no one had the answer . I need to know , Coulson . What does it mean ? ! I don 't know . I 'm trying to find out , just like you . [ breathing heavily ] - Do they drive you crazy ? - Yes . I started carving on walls . Is that how you started ? - Yes . - It 's not deep enough . You can 't just scratch the surface , Coulson . We have to dig deep . That 's why I started carving bodies . It has to be deep . - It 's not two-dimensional . - No . The answer isn 't on the surface . It 's what lies beneath . - We can find it ... together . - That 's the idea . No . No . [ groaning ] - What does it mean , Coulson ? - I don 't know . [ door hinges creak ] - Take your family ! Go ! - Come on . Go . Go ! [ grunting ] [ electricity crackles ] What the hell is Tahiti ? Uh , Tahiti was designed to revive a fallen Avenger . That 's how it got started . Uh , Captain America , Iron Man ... those Avengers ? - Those are the ones . - How the hell could Coulson forget that ? What , does he have alien blood , too ? [ chuckles ] Man , can you imagine that ... S.H.I.E.L.D. being run by a man that 's part alien ? Yeah , imagine that . - Stop ! Hey ! - What the ... C-Call the police . There 's two guys trying to kill each other . They 're out at my place , Thompson Welding . It 's right down the road . All right , stay here . We 'll handle this . Okay . [ tires squeal ] [ music ] Coulson : You want pain ? Come and get some . You can 't hide , Coulson . We 're connected by the blood . [ both grunting ] [ yelling ] The answer 's right here , Derik . [ door opens ] All you have to do is look ! - Let him go , Coulson ! - It 's okay ! I 'm okay now . That 's what you said before you threw me in a cell . Fair enough , but I 'm not trying to kill him ! I 'm trying to save him . I 'm giving you to the count of three , and my gun 's real . It 's here , Skye ... everything we 've been looking for . - One ! - He 's not kidding ! Let him go . - Open your eyes , Derik . - Two ! It 's just below the surface , like you said . - All you have to do is look . - Three ! You can put the guns away . He won 't hurt anyone now . How do you know that ? He found what he 's been looking for ... what we 've all been looking for . - The final piece . - I don 't believe it . It 's not so much a map as a blueprint . It 's a city . So , I was some kind of super-spy ? One of the best . We could use you . The whole story 's right here ... what you were , who you were . I know who I am . I 'm Hank Thompson . I 've got a wife I love , a kid I adore , and every day , I wake up happy . I can 't imagine I was happy being a spy . - Um , no offense . - None taken . Thank you , Mr. Coulson . Thank you for ... giving me a second chance , making me who I am . You 're a good man , Mr. Thompson . You always were . These agents will take you home now . Sorry about the blindfold . [ scoffs ] I understand . Spy stuff . Oh , uh , if you , uh ... if you ever need any welding , - you know where to find me . - Thanks . [ door closes ] Sebastian Derik has been turned over to the authorities . He had sins to atone for long before Tahiti ever happened . But ... at least he found his peace . - And you ? - [ beep , whirring ] The compulsion 's gone . - [ sighs ] How can you be sure ? - I can feel it . Whatever 's in our blood , it was driving us to go to that city , like homing pigeons , only we couldn 't figure out what home was , so it was just driving us mad . Once I had all the pieces ... now we just need to figure out why this alien was so hell-bent on getting there . Any news on Ward ? We 'll find him . In the meantime ... [ beep ] ... we 'll take advantage of his gift , Mr. Bakshi . Here 's his cellphone . See what you can find inside . All right . Let 's get this over with . To answer the question on everyone 's mind , no , I 'm not crazy . I know in the past few months , it may have seemed like I was leading you on some fool 's errand , chasing after strange carvings and artifacts . At times , I questioned it myself ... wondering if I was chasing windmills , trying to solve some unsolvable puzzle . But the pieces are coming together . The puzzle 's taking shape . The bad news ... HYDRA 's trying to solve the same puzzle , and they have more resources . The good news ... we now have a piece they don 't have . [ whirring ] Everything we 've been doing , it all ... leads here . Our job ... find it before anyone else . Coulson : We 'll return in a moment .

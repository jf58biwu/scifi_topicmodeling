 Woman , voice-over : I feel the sun on my face . I see trees all around me , scent of wildflowers on a breeze . It 's so beautiful . In this moment , I 'm not stranded in space . It 's been 97 years since a nuclear apocalypse killed everyone on Earth , leaving the planet simmering in radiation . Fortunately , there were survivors . 12 nations had operational space stations at the time of the bombs . There is now only The Ark , one station forged from the many . We 're told the Earth needs another 100 years to become survivable again . 4 more space-locked generations , and man can go home , back to the ground . The ground , that 's the dream . This is reality . [ Door opens ] Prisoner 319 , face the wall . Woman , voice-over : Reality sucks . What is this ? Quiet . Hold out your right arm . 319 : No . No . It 's not my time . I don 't turn 18 for another month . Man : Hold out your arm . Woman , voice-over : On The Ark , every crime , no matter how small , is punishable by death - unless you 're under 18 . - Your watch . No . It was my father 's . - Take it off . - No . - Hey ! - No . [ Zap ] Woman , voice-over : Juvenile offenders get put here ... lockup . We call it the sky box . [ Door opens ] Man : Prisoner 319 ... Woman : Clarke , stop . Wait here . Mom ? Mom , what 's going on ? What is this ? Come on . Let 's go . They 're killing us all , aren 't they , reducing population to make more time for the rest of you ? Clarke , you are not being executed . You 're being sent to the ground , all 100 of you . What ? But it 's not safe . - No . No . - Shh . We get reviewed at 18 . The rules have changed . This gives you a chance to live . Your instincts will tell you to take care of everybody else first , just like your father , but be careful . I can 't lose you , too . I love you so much . [ Click ] Oh ! Earth , Clarke . You get to go to Earth . [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Winces ] Welcome back . Look . Wells , why the hell are you here ? When I found out they were sending prisoners to the ground , I got myself arrested . - I came for you . - [ Crash ] Aah ! Oh ! Oh ! What was that ? That was the atmosphere . Prisoners of The Ark , here me now . You 've been given a second chance , and as your Chancellor , it is my hope that you see this as not just a chance for you , but a chance for all of us , indeed for mankind itself . We have no idea what is waiting for you down there . If the odds of survival were better , we would 've sent others . Frankly , we 're sending you because your crimes have made you expendable . Man : Your dad is a dick , Wells . Chancellor : Those crimes will be forgiven , your records wiped clean . I saw a ship launch not more than 20 minutes ago . Man : Who was on it ? Woman : Was it the prisoners ? They 're just kids . Are they going to Earth ? Has something changed ? Folks , as I said , at this time , we cannot confirm or deny anything . Man : Come on , lady ! Different man : My son is on that ship . Chancellor : The drop site has been chosen carefully . Before the last war , Mount Weather was a military base built within a mountain . It was to be stocked with enough non-perishables to sustain 300 people for up to two years . Man : Spacewalk bandit strikes again . Whoo ! Woman : Go , Finn ! Check it out . Your dad floated me , after all . You should strap in before the parachutes deploy . Clarke : Hey , you two , stay put if you want to live . Chancellor : Mount Weather is life . You must locate those supplies immediately . Finn : Hey , you 're the traitor who 's been in solitary for a year . You 're the idiot who wasted a month of oxygen on an illegal spacewalk . But it was fun . I 'm Finn . Chancellor : Your one responsibility is stay alive . Stay in your seats . Finn , are you ok ? Whoa ! Not now . Total system failure , that 's what we 're looking at . All we know for sure is that they were off course when we lost contact , so ... Tell me about communications . Other than the telemetry from their wristbands , we got nothing ... no audio , no video , no computer link . Everything that we programmed in to help them is gone . They 're on their own . Retrorockets ought to have fired by now . Ok . Everything on this ship is 100 years old , right ? Just give it a second . Clarke , there 's something I have to tell you . I 'm sorry I got your father arrested . Don 't you talk about my father . Please , I can 't die knowing that you hate me . They didn 't arrest my father , Wells . They executed him . I do hate you . [ People shouting ] [ Crash ] [ Machines stop ] Listen . No machine hum . Whoa . That 's a first . [ Buckles clicking ] Finn , is he breathing ? Man : The outer door is on the lower level . - Let 's go . - No . We can 't just open the doors . Man : Hey , just back it up , guys . Stop . The air could be toxic . If the air is toxic , we 're all dead , anyway . Woman : Bellamy ? My God , look how big you are . What the hell are you wearing , a guard 's uniform ? I borrowed it to get on the drop ship . Someone has got to keep an eye on you . Ha ha ! Clarke : Where 's your wristband ? Do you mind ? I haven 't seen my brother in a year . Man : No one has a brother . Woman : That 's Octavia Blake , the girl they found hidden in the floor . Octavia , Octavia , no . Let 's give them something else to remember you by . Yeah ? Like what ? Like being the first person on the ground in 100 years . [ Exhales ] Ah ... Uh ! We 're back , bitches ! [ All cheering ] [ Music playing ] Why so serious , princess ? It 's not like we died in a fiery explosion . Try telling that to the two guys who tried to follow you out of their seats . You don 't like being called princess , do you , princess ? Do you see that peak over there ? Yeah . Mount Weather . There 's a radiation-soaked forest between us and our next meal . They dropped us on the wrong damn mountain . There it is . We know they 've landed , but communications are down , which means we 're still blind to conditions on the ground . Thanks to Abby 's wristbands , at least we know how those conditions affect the human body , which is more than we 've had for 100 years . So nice work . Now , what are they telling us ? Abby : Two dead kids , dark tiles . Dr. Jackson , please share our theory with Councilor Kane . Of course . Granted , they 've only been on the ground for 7 minutes , but as of now , we believe the fatalities are due to the landing , not radiation levels . Abby : Both boys died at the same time that we lost contact with the drop ship . - Kane : Rough landing ? That 's your theory ? - The dots connect . Would you agree that if it was radiation , we 'd see fatalities climb fairly quickly now ? Because I 'm noticing a lot of red on that board . Spiking vital signs , two possibilities ... one , injuries sustained during landing . And the other ? They 're excited to be there . We got problems . The communications system is dead . I went to the roof . A dozen panels are missing . Heat fried the wires . Well , all that matters right now is getting to Mount Weather . See ? Look . This is us . This is where we need to get to if we want to survive . Where 'd you learn to do that ? Your father . Ah , cool , a map . They got a bar in this town ? I 'll buy you a beer . - You mind ? - Whoa . Man : Hey , hey , hey , hands off of him . He 's with us . Relax . We 're just trying to figure out where we are . Bellamy : We 're on the ground . That not good enough for you ? We need to find Mount Weather . You heard my father 's message . That has to be our first priority . Screw your father . What , you think you 're in charge here , you and your little princess ? Do you think we care who 's in charge ? We need to get to Mount Weather not because the Chancellor said so , but because the longer we wait , the hungrier we 'll get and the harder this 'll be . How long do you think we 'll last without those supplies ? We 're looking at a 20-mile trek , ok ? So if we want to get there before dark , we need to leave now . Bellamy : I got a better idea . You two go , find it for us . Let the privileged do the hard work for a change . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . You 're not listening . We all need to go . Look at this , everybody ... the Chancellor of Earth . Think that 's funny ? - Uh ! - Wells . Man : Yeah . Come on . Get him . No , but that was . All right . Man : What you gonna do now , Wells ? Come on . Come on . Man : Whoo ! Whoo ! Aw . Aw . Kid 's got one leg . How about you wait until it 's a fair fight ? Octavia : Hey , spacewalker , rescue me next . What ? He 's cute . He 's a criminal . They 're all criminals . Look , O. I came down here to protect you . I don 't need protecting . I have been locked up one way or another all my life . I am done following orders . I need to have fun , Bell . I need to just do something crazy just because I can , and no one , including you , is gonna stop me . I can 't stay with them , O. Now what are you talking about ? Woman : Go find something . I did something , ok , to get on the drop ship , something that they will kill me for when they come down . I can 't say what it is just yet , but you have to trust me . You do still trust me , don 't you ? Yeah . Uh ! So Mount Weather . When do we leave ? Right now . We 'll be back tomorrow with food . How are the two of you gonna carry enough food for 100 ? 4 of us . Can we go now ? Octavia : Sounds like a party . Make it 5 . Hey , what the hell are you doing ? - Going for a walk . - Hey , were you trying to take this off ? Yeah . So ? So this wristband transmits your vital signs to The Ark . Take it off , and they 'll think you 're dead . Should I care ? Well , I don 't know . Do you want the people you love to think you 're dead ? Do you want them to follow you down here in two months ? Because they won 't if they think we 're dying . Ok . Now let 's go . Go on . Mwah ! [ Sighs ] You shouldn 't have come here , Wells . Before you get any ideas , Finn is mine . Before you get any ideas , I don 't care . Hey , darling , how 's Clarke ? Abby : Her vital signs are strong , blood sugar is low . She hasn 't eaten . [ Telephone rings ] This is Dr. Griffin . On my way . Jackson , put it out there we need blood ... " A " neg . And a lot of it ... and then get your ass to the O.R. Woman : Abby , what 's wrong ? The Chancellor has been shot . Now , that , my friend , is game . That , my friend , is poison sumac . What ? It is ? The flowers aren 't poisonous . They 're medicinal , calming , actually . His family grows all the pharmaceuticals on The Ark . Hey , guys , would you try to keep up ? Finn : Come on , Clarke . How do you block all this out ? Well , it 's simple . I wonder , " why haven 't we seen any animals ? " Maybe it 's because there are none . Maybe we 've already been exposed to enough radiation to kill us . Sure is pretty , though . Come on . Someone should slip her some poison sumac . [ Snorts ] Finn : I got to know what you two did to get busted . Sumac is not the only herb in the garden , if you know what I mean . Someone forget to replace what we took . Someone has apologized , like , 1,000 times . How about you , Octavia ? What 'd they get you for ? Being born . That is so not game . No animals , huh ? [ Snap ] Uh ! Abby : Chancellor has lost a lot of blood . If only they found him sooner , damn it . Jackson : He 's waking up . Increase the anesthesia . Jackson : We used way too much blood and anesthesia . We 're way over the line . Your Chancellor is going into shock . You 're asking me to break the law . Fine . I 'll do it myself . Let them come after me . Excuse me , sir . You asked to be notified if there was news . The Chancellor is still in surgery , but we have I.D.ed the shooter . Bellamy Blake is the only person on The Ark unaccounted for . Who is he ? He 's no one , a janitor . We 're still working up a profile , but his motive for going to Earth is clear . Sister . I remember . Her mother kept her hidden for almost 16 years , nearly a record . What is it , Commander Shumway . Spit it out . We could start now . As Chancellor pro tempore , you can give the order to start reducing the population . Not yet . Sir , we 're wasting time . Removing the 100 from the population only buys us another month . Engineering needs more than that to fix those systems , if they can fix them at all . You have my answer , Commander . Enough . If we 're gonna kill hundreds of innocent people , we 're gonna do it by the book . Is that clear ? In the meantime , I want to know who helped this janitor get on that drop ship because he sure as hell didn 't do it by himself . Seems we have a traitor in our midst , Commander , and the 100 have an assassin in theirs . Man : Find any water yet ? No , not yet , but ... I 'm going back out if you want to come . [ Chuckles ] [ Sniffles ] You know , my father , he begged for mercy in the airlock chamber when your father floated him . You spelled " die " wrong , geniuses . If you 're gonna kill someone , it 's probably best not to announce it . [ Chuckles ] You 're not really a member of the guard , are you ? Bellamy : No . The real guard will be here soon unless we stop it . You don 't actually think they 're gonna forgive your crimes . Even if they do , then what ? Guys like us , we 're gonna become model citizens now , get jobs , if we 're lucky , - maybe pick up their trash ? - You got a point ? No . I got a question . They locked you up , dumped you down here like lab rats to die . So why are you helping them ? The hell we are . You 're wearing those bracelets , aren 't you ? Right now , those things are telling them whether or not it 's safe to follow us down . Ok . You said we could stop it . How ? Take them off . The Ark will think you 're dead , that it 's not safe to follow . You follow ? Right , and if we do , I mean , what 's in it for us ? Someone has got to help me run things . Hey , Ab . How 's the Chancellor doing ? Ask me again if he makes it through the night . Who else did we lose ? Murphy and Mbege , both named John . Kane : Neither was injured during landing . I concur . Something else killed these two . One second , they were fine , - and the next , bang . - Then it isn 't radiation . Kane : Come on , Abby . Wishful thinking isn 't good science . It 's not wishful thinking . One second , fine , the next , bang isn 't how exposure to radiation presents . Well , it could be if there was enough of it . If there was enough of it , they would all be dead . Please let me be right . Finn : Hey , you know what I 'd like to know ? Why send us down today after 97 years ? What changed ? Who cares ? I 'm just glad they did . I woke up rotting in a cell , and now I 'm spinning in a forest . Maybe they found something on a satellite , you know , like an old weather satellite or ... It wasn 't a satellite . The Ark is dying . At the current population level , there 's roughly 3 months left of life support , maybe 4 now that we 're gone . So that was the secret they locked you up to keep , why the kept you in solitary , floated your old man ? My father was the engineer who discovered the flaw . He thought the people had a right to know . The council disagreed . My mother disagreed . They were afraid it would cause a panic . We were gonna go public , anyway , when Wells ... What , turned in your dad ? Clarke : Anyway , the guard showed up before we could . That 's why today . That 's why it was worth the risk . Even if we all die , at least they bought themselves more time . They 're gonna kill more people , aren 't they ? Good . After what they did to me , I say , float them all . You don 't mean that . We have to warn them . That 's what my father said . Oh , damn , I love Earth . Oh ! Holy ... Ha ha ! Hoo hoo hoo . Octavia , what the hell are you doing ? [ Splash ] Octavia ... I can 't swim . I know , but we can stand . Ha ha ha ! Clarke : Wait . There 's not supposed to be a river here . Well , there is . So take off your damn clothes . Oh ... Octavia , get out of the water . Get out of the water now ! Aah ! Octavia ! Aah ! No . Aah ! Aah ! What the hell is that ? We have to help her . - What are you gonna do ? - Try not to get eaten . No . Wait . If we distract it , it might let her go . Help me . Aah ! No ! Uh ! Man : It worked . It let her go . Can you get to the shore now ? [ Octavia gasping ] I got you . Man : It 's coming back . It 's headed right for you , guys . Come on . Come on . Keep going . Ok . Thank you . Thank you . You 're gonna be ok . Note to self ... next time , save the girl . [ Laughter ] [ People whooping ] Woman : Yeah . Go on , baby . Man : Yeah . Keep going . Ah , ah ... ah ! [ All whooping ] Who 's next ? Wells : What the hell are you doing ? We 're liberating ourselves . What does it look like ? It looks like you 're trying to get us all killed . The communication system is dead . These wristbands are all we got . Take them off , and The Ark will think we 're dying , that it 's not safe for them to follow . That 's the point , Chancellor . We can take care of ourselves , can 't we ? Yeah ! Wells : You think this is a game ? Those aren 't just our friends and our parents up there . They 're our farmers , our doctors , our engineers . I don 't care what he tells you . We won 't survive here on our own ... and besides , if it really is safe , how could you not want the rest of our people to come down ? My people already are down . Those people locked my people up . Those people killed my mother for the crime of having a second child . Your father did that . - My father didn 't write the laws . - No . He enforced them , but not anymore , not here . Here , there are no laws . - Yeah . Yeah . - Cool . Here , we do whatever the hell we want whenever the hell we want . Now , you don 't have to like it , Wells . You can even try to stop it or change it , kill me . You know why ? Whatever the hell we want . Murphy : Whatever the hell we want ! Man : Whatever the hell we want ! All : * whatever the hell we want * ♪ whatever the hell we want ♪ ♪ whatever the hell we want ♪ ♪ whatever the hell we want ♪ ♪ whatever the hell we want ♪ ♪ whatever the hell we want ♪ ♪ whatever the hell we want ♪ ♪ whatever the hell we want ♪ ♪ whatever the hell we want ♪ [ Thunder ] Rain ! Real rain ! Man : Check it out ! Woman : It 's water ! We need to collect this . Whatever the hell you want . [ All cheering ] [ Thunder ] 10 more , one after the next . Abby , look at plasma osmolarity . It 's going up across the board . They found water . Councilor Abigail Griffin , you 're under arrest for exceeding the maximum medical supplies allowed for a patient . Sorry this has to be public . The policy in these matters is very clear ... no special treatment . - How much blood did you use , Abby ? - Don 't answer that . I used whatever it took . Breaking the law to keep you from becoming Chancellor was the easiest decision I 've ever made . In that case , given your confession , in my role as Chancellor pro tempore , you leave me no choice but to find you guilty . We always have a choice , Kane . You chose to press charges against my husband , your friend , even though you knew he would get floated for it . You chose to include my daughter in those charges , and now you 're choosing this . Hiding behind the law absolves you of nothing . Be that as it may , in accordance with penal code one , because all crimes committed by those above the age of maturity are capital crimes , you are hereby sentenced to death . Execution is set for the morning , and I choose at every turn and at any cost to make sure that the human race stays alive . That 's the difference between us , Kane . I choose to make sure that we deserve to stay alive . [ Door closes ] [ Whimpers ] [ Birds chirping ] [ Music playing ] Pretty cool , huh ? Did you go to the river ? Figured it was worth losing a finger or two . Here . You call that a sip ? You think this means we 're all gonna grow two heads ? Ha ha ! What do you know ? She can laugh . Come on . You have to see this . That 's a toe . Plus , near as I can tell , whatever it is , it 's walking on two feet . My Guess ... monkeys . Pbbt ! Ha ! I 'm sorry . It 's just , according to everything I 've read , there were no bipedal animals anywhere near here , certainly not monkeys . Right . You read anything about glow-in-the-dark forests or man-eating snakes ? [ Door opens ] Are you out of your mind ? You can 't just kill everyone who disagrees with you . Now , you all think I 'm a bad guy , but I 'm the only one who 's willing to do what it takes to save us . She 's my best friend . So what do you want me to say , I 'm sorry ? I 'm not . Friendship is a luxury we can 't afford , and if I have to take us down to a cosmic Adam and Eve , I will do it . Please , show mercy , if not for Abby , then for me . We can 't afford mercy , either . - Mmph ... - Shh . Shh . That 's far enough . I don 't want to shoot you , Wells ... hell , I like you ... but I do need them to think that you 're dead . Why ? Why are you doing this , for real , not some crap about getting to do what you want to do ? I have my reasons . I also have the gun . So I ask the questions , and the question is , why aren 't you helping me ? You dad banished you , Wells , and yet here you are , still doing his bidding , following the rules . Aren 't you tired of always doing what 's expected of you ? Stand up to him . Take off that wristband , and you 'll be amazed at how good it feels . No . Never . Not gonna happen . Is that clear enough for you ? Yeah . It is . I 'm sorry it had to be this way . No ! No ! Get off of me ! No ! Get him down . Put him down . No ! Come on , man . Let me go . Get it . Do it . No ! Don 't do this ! Don 't do this ! No . No ! Come on , man . Aah ! [ Door opens ] Man : Dr. Griffin , it 's time . Callie . [ Sobbing ] That 's enough . Watch out for Clarke for me . Ok . Abby : Jackson , use the wristbands . There may be a way to reverse-engineer them for communication . Talk to Sinclair in engineering . Nod if you understand . Chancellor : Stop . Dr. Griffin is pardoned . I 'll deal with you later . Open the door . Open the door . I spent 12 hours putting those intestines back together . Get him back to bed now . Tell me about the 100 . Did they make it ? [ Music playing ] You wanted to go first . Now quit stalling . Mount weather awaits . Just hang on till the apogee , and you 'll be fine . The apogee like the Indians , right ? Apogee , not apache . Clarke : He knows . Today , Finn . Aye , aye , captain . See you on the other side . - Wait . - What ? Let me . I can do it . Knew there was a badass in there somewhere . Heh heh . Hey , it 's ok to be afraid , Jasper . The trick is not fighting it . See you on the other side . Ha ha ! Whoo ! Whoo ! Whoo ! Yeah ! We are apogee ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yes ! Whoo ! Yeah ! Whoo ! You did it , Jasper ! Whoo ! Yeah ! Ha ha ha ! Let 's go , princess . You 're up . Jasper : Come on , Clarke ! You got this ! Whoo ! Apogee ! Jasper : We did it ! Mount weather ! Whoo ! Whoo ! Yes ! Whoo ! Finn : Yeah , Jasper ! Jasper . Come on . Come on . Come on . Jasper ! Jasper ! No . Come on . Get down . Get down . Come on .

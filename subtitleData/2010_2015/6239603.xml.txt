 RUSH : This is what Destiny intended from the moment it entered the star system . YOUNG : That ship is the best chance we have of getting home . - Are we done ? - We 'll never be done . WRAY : You shouldn 't have left him on the planet . YOUNG : You think I don 't know that ? CHLOE : Everyone thinks we 're safe . They think that they 'll never find us again . Why did you take one of our people prisoner ? ( SNARLING ) CHLOE : We 're not safe , are we ? - TELFORD : They 're coming . - YOUNG : Who 's coming ? The Lucian Alliance , they 're coming to take Destiny . RUSH : There 's only one way this is gonna end if we wait . YOUNG : I 'm not surrendering this ship . WRAY : I don 't know if you 've met Ginn . Homeworld Security wants to talk to her now . About the planned attack on Earth ? I want you to walk with me , side by side , for the benefit of everyone . Okay , so , what are we talking about , some kind of code , a ... a message ? - WRAY : We 're all sitting here , ready . - Ready for what ? Nothing that concerns you . - We need to talk . - I 'm sorry ? I 'm Dr. Amanda Perry . I ... RUSH : I 've thought a lot about seeing you again . This time is different . Sometimes with the stones it 's easy to forget you 're in another person 's body . BRODY : How can you just forgive him ? No , who says I did ? He 's done nothing but lie to us . I don 't believe he intended for Riley to die . Yeah , but he was responsible . And he 's going to have to live with that . I 'm not saying he was right . What are you saying ? That I 'm trying to understand why he did what he did . - Something wrong ? - On the contrary . So far , it seems like everything you said is true . About the Ancients finding evidence of a signal once being broadcast across the universe . ( STATIC ) It is amazing . A distinct structure in the background radiation . That sounds like static to me . You were expecting Stairway to Heaven ? This is huge . It suggests more than a random order to the universe . Possibly constructed by intelligent life . We 're assuming you had no luck deciphering any of it . Is this the reason you brought me up here ? Well , you have planted false information in the database before . - I 'm just saying ... - Actually , I 'm consulting . Part of a new spirit of cooperation . As you may have noticed , we dropped ourselves out of FTL . There are three planets in range . Conditions ? One 's a wasteland , but two show promise . Okay , I 'll have a look . No , no , you go on . You go get some rest . - No , no , I 'm fine . I 'm okay . - No , seriously . I will tell you when there is something worth writing home about . Sorry to have bothered you . Go ahead . Okay . Thanks . - Hey , listen ... - Don 't worry , Eli . Nothing 's going to happen . Nothing 's going to happen . We can start gathering some Kino data . Let me go to the Gate Room . I 'll put together some teams . VOLKER : Yeah . You don 't have any idea how much longer Homeworld Command is going to want to talk to Ginn , do you ? I mean , it just seems like they 've been questioning her for ... I 'm going to go to work . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Mandy ? Mandy , it 's Nick . This is Rush . I need help , Ginn 's quarters , now . ♪ Stargate Universe : " Malice " ♪ Season 2 Episode 8 Eli ... ( OVER RADIO ) Colonel , this is Scott . All Lucian Alliance members are accounted for and locked down except Simeon . Michaels was assigned to him , and he is not responding on radio . ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ) ( GUN FIRING ) ( DOOR OPENS ) ( GASPS ) We don 't know for sure . It 's never been confirmed - that that 's what happened . - Until further notice . Teams of two , room by room . I want him found . ( OVER RADIO ) Airman Dunning , come in . This is Young . Please respond . Sir , this is James . Amanda Perry is dead . Rush ! Hey , Rush . JAMES : Sir , there 's more . Ginn told Homeworld Command some things you 'll want to hear . ( SCREAMING ) Colonel , give me a gun . Wait here . ( DOOR OPENS ) - ( GUN FIRING ) - ( MAN GROANING ) ( GASPS ) - Oh ! - Close and lock the doors . Now ! ( DOOR OPENS ) Dial . ( DIALING ) Two men are down . He 's locked himself in the Gate Room with at least one hostage . Nobody 's getting in here . Just , please , let her go . Don 't move . Come here . Colonel , this is Greer . I found Michaels . He 's dead , sir . - Look , take me instead . - No . Shut up ! Both of you . Move . Wait ... ( WHIMPERING ) Mr. Brody , I need the door opened now ! I 'm working on it . ( DOOR OPENS ) - Where 'd he go ? - He went through . Wait . Wait ! Where is he ? He took Park . Rush went through after him . Re-dial . ( DIALING ) There 's something on my back . He put something on my back . ( SIGHS ) Let 's move . He 's bleeding badly . I need help here . Get him on the table . Bag him . I 've got a chest wound over here ! - Is the airway clear ? - Yes . Use the plastic to apply pressure . You want to avoid air in the wound . AIRMAN : Hold it steady ! - He 's bleeding pretty bad . - JOHANSEN : I can 't get away . AIRMAN : All right , let 's get this clamped . He stopped breathing . Do what you can . I need a tube . YOUNG : Talk to me . Simeon went through with Park hostage . Rush went after him . Well , we need Simeon alive . - Sir ? - Ginn told Homeworld Command that he knows the details of the Alliance attack being planned against Earth . The location of the base , who 's involved . He may be the only way to stop them . Assuming he 'll tell us . It 's a bomb , isn 't it ? One of theirs . Yes . We studied them , didn 't we ? Ginn , she told us how they work . This is Rush . Do not come through . Repeat , do not come through . I am attempting to disarm an explosive at the base of the gate . - Do you copy ? - This is Young . Copy that . Keep the gate open . RUSH : I 'll let you know when it 's clear . ( STARGATE PUDDLE OPENS ) Hold still . I 'm going to try and remove the cover . ( ELECTRONIC CLICKING ) Rush , this is Volker . Can you hear me ? You can 't disarm it , but you can remove the proximity sensor . Yeah . Please shut up . There ... There 's a fuse . RUSH : I know . I just ... These pinholes are too small . I just ... I don 't have anything that 's going to do this . - I 'm sorry , I ... I can 't . - ( WHIMPERING ) Oh , God . Okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . Get out of here . It 's okay . ( SOBBING ) It 's okay . ( RAPID CLICKING ) Wait , wait , wait . Yeah . ( BOMB WHIRRING ) ( EXPLOSION ) - You okay ? - Yeah . - You all right ? - Yeah . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Go . Rush ! I 've got him . Rush ! ( GUN FIRING ) What happened ? Simeon killed the man guarding him , then he killed Ginn . Where is he ? He took a hostage through the gate . Colonel , I swear , I had no idea ... Before he got to her , Ginn told Homeworld Command that Simeon had intelligence about an attack that was being planned against Earth . Are you kidding me ? Ginn and Simeon were from the same clan . Are you saying you know nothing about this ? You know the Lucian Alliance are made up of different factions . There are many secrets between them . If I did know , I would have told you before now . Is there anyone else on board from that clan ? No . Colonel , about Simeon , don 't underestimate him . If I 'm guilty of anything , it 's not warning you about him sooner . He 's not going to get away . - Let me help . - I think you 've done enough . I think it might be better if you just let him go . He killed three people , injured four more . You 'll lose more people trying to bring him in alive . He 's dangerous . Trust me . ( EXPLOSION ) Stay , stay , stay , stay ! This is Scott . I 'm okay . Hold your positions . ( PANTING ) - Are you hurt ? - No . No , no . I 'm fine , I 'm fine . Ah , wait . Wait , wait . Stop ! What the hell ? Rush , we need Simeon alive . He may have intel on a Lucian Alliance attack on Earth . And you think he 's going to tell you ? That 's not my problem , right now . I 've got orders . I don 't care . Listen , Rush , I get it , okay ? I can see how angry you are , but you 're going to get yourself killed . You have no idea where he could be hiding . Just give me a second . - Lieutenant James , do you read ? - JAMES ON RADIO : Yes , sir . We will call our position due west of the gate . I want two men left behind to guard the gate in case he circles back . The rest will split up into two teams of three . One will head southwest , the other northwest . Radio contact every 15 minutes . Roger that . James out . Do we send you back to Destiny , or are you here to help ? Listen . Listen ! We have orders . Right now , we need him alive . As far as I 'm concerned , as soon as the Colonel is done with him , you can do whatever the hell you want to the son of a bitch . I don 't care . If you don 't kill him , I will . Right now , there could be lives at stake , people back on Earth . They may be a billion light years away , but we still may be able to do something about it . Are you hearing me ? Okay . We 've got nine hours till Destiny jumps back into FTL . If we have not found him in four-and-a-half , we are turning back . Let 's move . Hey . - You okay ? - Yeah . I still ... I don 't understand why he let me live . Well , he 's a soldier . I mean , to him , this is a war and you were unarmed . What , you think he was being honorable ? That , or he knew how much it would torture you . Colonel Young wants us to stall the clock . That 's what I 'm going to do . Going to figure out how to stall the clock . Hey . What can I do ? Hey . Are you okay ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . - Look , I 'm ... I 'm so sorry ... Yeah , I know . You did everything you could . - You sure you 're all right ? - Yeah . - Where are we at ? - We 're trying to stall the clock . Hey . T. J ? ( SIGHS ) Dunning , Graham , and Lougheed are all probably going to make it . Infection is always a risk . What about Henderson ? This message you found in the ship 's database ... More of a signal , a repeating pattern . - You have any idea what it means ? - No . Obviously you think it 's important . ( CHUCKLING ) Yes . It 's important . Its existence defies the very laws of physics . Is it a message from God , the almighty creator of the universe , as I 'm sure you would like to believe ? Well , I don 't know . We 'll just have to wait and see , won 't we ? Let 's go . I don 't care if the Colonel forgives him . I never will . Well , I 'm not sure if anyone 's forgiven him , but maybe he 's right , that fulfilling Destiny 's mission is our best chance of getting home one day . All I 'm saying is , from now on , he 'd better watch his own back . We have no control over the clock yet . We 're definitely not going to solve this before Destiny jumps back into FTL this time . This time . Well , we have to stay in FTL a minimum of four hours , at which point we can drop back out again . Good news is we 'll still be in range . That 'll be our last chance , though . GREER : Not much time left . They 'll still be able to drop out in range . Check it out . What is it ? Some kind of animal . Is it something we can barbecue ? ( CRYING ) ( CRYING CONTINUES ) I can see why you would blame yourself . For what it 's worth , you didn 't mean for this to happen . I brought her onboard . I understand why you kept the secret ... Why you felt you couldn 't trust Colonel Young . But we 're going to have to work these things out . All of us together , from now on , learn to trust each other . What happened to following orders ? Yeah , well , some things are more complicated than that . Congratulations . I 'm saying we have to try and figure out what 's right . Not me . Revenge isn 't going to bring her back . ( SOBBING ) I know . SCOTT : You think it 's going to make it easier to live with ? I don 't even know if we 're going to find him anyway . He could be hiding anywhere . I guess the good news is he 'll probably die a miserable death out here . He 's got a Kino remote . He 'll probably wait for us to leave , and then ... Try and use the gate to find his way back to the Lucian Alliance we left behind . GREER : Lieutenant . That looks like a track . ( GUNSHOTS ) You see him ? I think he 's up there . James , this is Scott . Do you read ? JAMES ON RADIO : Go ahead , Lieutenant . Yeah , he 's got us pinned down . We heard the shots . All right , good . That means you 're close . We are at the bottom of a canyon , and he is dug in somewhere on a ridge northwest of our position . I see the canyon . We 're topside . Moving to flank him now . - E. T.A. Is five minutes . - Copy that . CHLOE ON RADIO : Eli ? Eli , it 's Chloe . Can you hear me ? I can hear you . T.J. Told me what happened . I 'm really sorry . Look , I can 't talk right now . What are you doing ? Are you in the navigation interface ? - Yeah . - I told you to stay out of that . Sorry , I just ... You know , this is complicated enough without you messing up everything I 'm trying to do . CHLOE ON RADIO : Eli ? Sorry . I don 't have time right now . I 'll ... Come and see you later . - We need to drop out . - So drop out ! - Just warning you . - Great . ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) ( BEEPING ) - Eight hours . - ( SIGHING ) Great . - Colonel Young , this is Brody . - ( OVER RADIO ) Go ahead . We 've got eight hours on the clock . I 'll notify the team on the planet . One last time , to be clear , sir , this will be our last window . Understood . Young out . Eli ... Just leave me alone . Okay ? ( KINO BEEPING ) JAMES : Lieutenant , we 're approaching his position . Stand by . Roger that . Rush get down ! Tell them to get back . Tell them to get back ! Get back . It is a trap ! I repeat , it is a trap ! Take cover ! James ! James ! Come in ! ( GRUNTING ) Sir , we got wounded up here . How bad ? Torres is unconscious . Looks like Weber 's arm is broken . Corporal Lee , do you read ? LEE ON RADIO : Read you , Lieutenant . Moving to cover Lieutenant James ' position . Assist with getting the wounded back to the Stargate . Yes , sir . How did you know ? I had a feeling . When I stood up and presented a target , he didn 't shoot . JAMES ON RADIO : What about you , sir ? We can 't leave you here without backup . Stand by . I saw you doing something with that Kino remote . Yeah , I was checking the time . Damn it , Rush ! Stop lying to me ! Okay , I thought there might be a way for one remote to pinpoint the location of another . You knew he wasn 't on that ridge anymore . Well , I 've only figured it out now ! Do you know his position ? Yes , I think so . James , we think we 've found a way of tracking Simeon using the Kino remote . Get the wounded safely back to the gate and check back in . By my calculations , we 've got a little less than an hour before we 've got to turn back . We are going after him . Roger that . Let 's move . Hey , Eli . What you doing ? Going to help on the planet , and I don 't care what you say . I 'm not going to be able to figure out how to stall the clock in the time we have . What exactly do you think you 're going to do on the planet ? I don 't know . Something . He 's already injured two more Marines . These are highly trained combat ... Do you even know how complicated Ancient programming algorithms are ? 'Cause Rush didn 't solve it , and he 's had a couple of months . I need you to get back to the bridge . Even if I could find a way to quickly bypass all the protocols and add time to the clock , I have no idea what the consequences might be down the line . For all I know , we may end up burning out all our power before we reach the next star . Are you ordering me to do that ? I am considering the fact that we may be able to save lives on Earth . ( SCOFFING ) Only if we catch Simeon alive and if he just tells you what you want to know . 'Cause , really , what are the chances of that ? Now , are you going to let me have one of these weapons or not ? You 're angry . Is that it , Eli ? I get that . I also know that this is not something that is in you , and that 's not something that you should be ashamed of . Now , listen to me . Killing someone , no matter how much you think they deserve it , is going to change you . All right ? Don 't you act like you are the only person aboard this ship , that has lost someone that they care about . - I know . - Good . I need you to get back to the bridge . Here . Got him . RUSH : Shoot him ! ( GRUNTING ) What are you doing ? Shoot him ! - I did . - Again ! What the hell 's the matter with you ? You had him in your sight ! - Get off ! - What 's the matter with you ? Rush ! He did the right thing ! What is the point of being able to track him if we can 't catch up to him ! He is wounded now ! Killing him could kill countless people back on Earth . We are running out of time , and you 're dreaming if you think he 's ever going to tell you what you want to know ! ( GUNSHOT ) ( GREER GRUNTING ) Hey ! Let me see , let me see . - ( GREER GROANING ) - Buddy , you 're going to be okay . It doesn 't look that bad . Rush ? Rush ! Ooh , I 've got to get you back to the ship . Go ! Go get him . I 'm ... I 'm fine . No , you 're not . You are bleeding pretty bad . - I thought you said it didn 't look bad . - Ah , I lied . ( GROANING ) Rush , you 've got to listen to me . Greer has been hit . SCOTT ON RADIO : I 've got to get him back to the gate . You were right . We are out of time . You have to turn back . Do you hear me ? This is not worth it . We need you , Rush . Don 't throw everything away for this . Rush ? Rush ? She says she can help . Really ? How ? Well , you know Rush has been giving me problems to solve . Equations . I ... I didn 't understand any of it at first , but I would stare at it for hours , and then suddenly something would pop into my head and ... And I would write it down . Yeah , I know . Look , I get it . You want to help . The point is , I think I 'm starting to understand it , Eli . It 's like I 'm slowly getting control of whatever is in my head . Or it 's getting control of you . You really want us to give her access to the ship 's systems ? Eli , this is me talking . Please . I really think if I could just see what the problems are . Can 't hurt to let her look , can it ? Actually , yes , it could . We 're assuming that any solutions she may provide us are what we really need . Yeah , and not some subroutine that could sabotage the ship . The last thing we need right now are those aliens attacking us again . And that 's what I 'm counting on all of you for . ( GRUNTING ) ( PANTING ) Rush ... I know you didn 't care enough about Ginn to risk your life coming after me . I 'm sure it was that other woman she was connected to . SIMEON ON RADIO : You must have really cared for her . I understand revenge . Your people have killed enough of mine . People I cared about . I let you live . You know why ? I wanted you to live with it , the way I have . I wanted the pain to eat you alive . I know it 's a fate worse than death . I let you live , but next time I won 't . You want your revenge ? You come and get it , Rush . I 'm going to put you out of your misery . Come and get me . ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) Hey , what are you doing ? Chloe ! Stop her ! ( GASPING ) It 's okay . What do you mean , " it 's okay " ? What did you just do ? I ... I don 't know , but it 's okay . You said you were in control . Yeah , I am . Do you even know what you just did ? No . - I 'm sorry . I ... - You should go back to your quarters . Come on . Come on . Eli ! You should look at this . They stall the clock yet ? No , sir . Less than two hours now until Destiny jumps again . - And they say that 's it . - Dial the gate . - What about Rush ? - ( BUTTONS BEEPING ) ( DISTANT GUNSHOTS ) ( GUNSHOTS ) ( DISTANT EXPLOSION ) ( DISTANT RUMBLING ) ( BEASTS ROARING ) ( WIND HOWLING ) I have information . ( PANTING ) ( SIGHING ) Oh , God . - You 're late . - I know . Nine hours late . - How 's Greer ? - He 's going to be okay . You ? You didn 't answer your radio . The battery died a long time ago . You didn 't come after me . Eli figured out how to track the Kino remotes the same way you did . We saw two signals heading back this way together , figured one of you had them both and the other was dead . True . You couldn 't have known you had so much extra time . What in the hell were you thinking ? I knew Eli would figure out how to stall the clock . Really ? Because he didn 't . What ? Chloe calculated a new FTL course . She turned the ship around to come back and get you . Good for her . You gave her those equations knowing she might be able to figure it out . I did . Dial the gate . Eli said there may still be unforeseeable consequences as a result . Well , there always are , aren 't there ? I hope you were right about Simeon not telling us about the attack on Earth . I 'd hate to think we could have prevented it . You feel any better ?

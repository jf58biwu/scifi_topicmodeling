 Remember this place , Leela ? Yep . The moon . It 's been here for quite a while . Yeah , but it 's also where we came on our very first delivery together . Oh , right . Man , we sure used to try harder back then . Get your likeness in the form of a balloon sculpture . A cherished family keepsake for hours to come . One Leela , please . And use your finest balloons . Wow , you 're good . Five years of art school . Ow ! Want a corn dog ? Sure . Then your mom should have bought you one . - Ooh , fancy . - Hold tight . The Mecha-Hexadecapus is about to flail erratically into action . Yeah . You know , I 'm feeling a little ... Leela ! Oh ! Ah ! Poor Leela . I never even told her I loved her . What ! You told her , like , 140 times . Yeah , but she paid very little attention to me . Oh , Bender . I always thought me and her would grow old together . You gotta live in the moment , baby . And in this moment , Leela 's dead . Sir , we have some good news and some bad news . The good news is , we found your stuffed animal . What 's the bad news ? Your wife is dead . She wasn 't my wife . Oh , then there is no bad news . Leela . You 're alive . She gave her life to save mine . Bender , can I come in and talk ? I 'm kind of busy . Seeing Leela fly off the Hexadecapus and crash through the moon dome and survive inside a stuffed animal by breathing a balloon was a dose of reality . Come in . All this time , I 've been wondering if I can spend my life with her . But what I realize now is , I can 't spend my life without her . So , tomorrow , I 'm asking her to marry me . Uh-huh . Good talk . We 're done here . My little meatbags growing up . Computer , Jamaican Joy Juice , hot . G.N.E. Behold the Time Button . A pocket-sized device that sends the entire universe 10 seconds into the past . I will now demonstrate . Joy Juice , hot . Pretty cool , eh ? I 'm over here where I was 10 seconds ago . Somethings cool ' ? Show it to us . Oh , right . You were outside the button ball , so you don 't remember a thing I said . Let 's try again , but this time , everyone cram into my time shelter . Wow . Nice . It 's coated with antichroniton-resistant grout to shield you from the effects of the button . Come on . Get in . Hurry up . Friends , I found $ 10 . $ 10 , you say ' ? Let me see . It fell off a man . The man got into a taxi , but the money did not . Friends , I found $ 10 . You found some money ? Show me . Ah ... Say , check out the money I found . It fell off a chump . Hey , Professor , couldn 't you go back in time as far as you want by pressing the button over and over ? Certainly not . Each time the button sends you back 10 seconds , it takes 10 seconds to recharge . There , it 's recharged . Ah ... Again , again . Question ? What if you had a special moment that you wished could go on forever ? Could the Time Button make it last as long as you wanted ? Hell , no . This button is for scientific use only . Ah ... Yes , I 'd like an engagement diamond , please ? You come to the right joint , ace . I 'll take this one . Classy choice , chief . She 'll crap her pants . That 'll be five bills . Hey , give me back my stones . Hello , stranger . This is my first time here . Do you sell diamonds ? You come to the right joint , ace . I guess what I 'm saying is , the next time you almost die , I want it to be as my wife . The clam , Elzar . Clam , bam , thank you , ma 'am . Fry ? Wow . Leela , my love , will you ... I 'll have what she 's having . Oh , God . I ruined everything . I blew my one chance to ... Hey , wait a second . Clam , bam , thank you , ma 'am . Fry ? Wait . Allow me . Leela , my love , will you marry me ? Oh , my gosh . This is all so sudden after 13 years . Don 't answer yet . I want this to be a special moment , so I rented the roof garden on top of the tallest building in New New York . The Vampire State Building ? Uh-huh . If your answer 's yes , be there tonight at 6 : 30 , half hour before sunset And if my answer 's no ' ? Then just don 't show up . I 'll get the message . Big night , eh , Mr. Fry ? The biggest , Janos . Check this out . What is that ? Some kind of time button ? Exactly . If she says yes , I 'll use it to make the sunset last as long as we want . Strange things happen when the shadows lengthen . Janitor to the 237th floor men 's room . Six o 'clock . She 'll be here in half an hour . 6 : 30 ? Maybe she 's stuck in slow traffic . I know she 'll come . I know it . I really thought she was gonna come . I traveled a thousand years forward in time , but without Leela , I have no future . This is the end . Good-bye , my love . Leela ? Hey . It 's only 6 : 25 . So why does my watch say 7 : 03 ? Of course . My watch is fast because it kept running every time I hit the button . So Leela 's actually on time . Hi , Leela . Fry . It 's okay , I 'm gonna die happy . No , wait . I 'll go back 10 seconds till when I was on the roof . Rats . Guess I was falling for more than 10 seconds . Hi , Leela . Fry . Everything 's cool . Wait a second . There 's no possible way out of this situation . Help , help ! Fry . I 'm stuck in a loop . This isn 't the moment I wanted to last forever . Careful . This is the most valuable thing we 've ever delivered . Oh ! Careful . This is the most ... Quickly . Into the time shelter . Someone stole the Time Button , and they 're pressing it every 10 seconds . The universe is caught in a time loop . Then let 's go out and stop them . Are you mad ? Because that would make two of us . You 're right . We 'd never get anywhere . We 'd just keep jumping back to where we started . Also , we 'd die horribly . You see , we 're shielded in here . So if we leave the time shelter and the button gets pressed less than 10 seconds later , the antichronitons wouldn 't know where to send us back to . We 'd be shredded across the time-space continuum like human coleslaw . Yum . Observe . Ah ... Listen , I know who stole the button . I wasn 't gonna tell , because I don 't like being helpful . But I do like ratting people out , so , it was Fry . He took it to the Vampire State Building . We 've got to get to him . But how ? We can 't leave the time shelter . Hooray . I 'm trapped in a tiny fun room with friends . Man , falling from a great height an infinite number of times can be stressful . At least I have Leela 's comforting scream to look forward to . Fry . Fry ! Hurry , hurry , hurry , hurry , hurry , stop . Hurry , hurry , hurry , hurry hurry , hurry , hurry ... My boyfriend gave me a diamond Hurry , hurry , hurry ... Oh ! Fry . We 're hereto rescue you . Professor ? Cups ! Fry . Professor ? He 's ... He 's dead . It does look that way . My poor sweet puddle . The button . I can still save him . No , don 't . You 'll shred me into a zillion ... It worked . But you killed the Professor . Yeah , but it worked . I died . I 'm dead . I 'm gonna die . Come on , come on . Fry , what 's happening ? Did you fall off the building ? Actually , that 's kind of a funny story ... He sure has a lot of blood for a skinny guy . And I didn 't want to go on living without you , so I jumped , and , well ... Ohh ... That 's so sweet , Fry . You know those dreams where you 're falling , and right before you hit the ground you wake up ? Those are great . If only there were a way to make Fry land softly , this would all be over . Ooh , I know . My airbag . Leela . I 'm coming to save the day . Hang on , Fry . You 're just one death away from being saved . And then we can be marry me ? Okay , I 'm gonna run out there . Then , you guys form a human bus and crash into me at 40 miles an hour . Ready ? Go . We did it . Whoo ! What happened ? Did I break the button ? I think you broke the universe . Everything but us is frozen . What are we gonna do ? First , I 'm gonna get back these earrings I loaned Amy three years ago . After that , I don 't know . This is surreal . Whatever we want is ours for the taking . Hello ? Anyone ? I guess it 's just us for all eternity . Listen , Leela , I 'm not sure what kind of life we can make together in this frozen time-sicle , but if it 's not too weird ... Will you still marry me ? I would marry you even if you weren 't the last man on Earth . What was that ? I don 't know ... But I 'm scared . Well , maybe we just need some rest . We can get married in the morning . Except there won 't be morning . We can worry about that in the morning . Do I , Philip J. Fry , take you , Turanga Leela , to be my lawful wedded wife ? You do . Do I , Turanga Leela , take you , Philip J. Fry , to be my lawful wedded husband ? Uh , yes ? Absolutely . There it is again . Leave my wife alone , you glimmer . It 's okay , Fry . If it keeps bugging us , we 'll either kill it or adopt it . Meanwhile , what do you say we get started on a very , very , very long honeymoon ? I think it 's about time we drank the champagne Janos poured all those years ago . May I read the toast I was going to make ? Go for it . I 'm in no rush , after walking up 240 flights of steps . And across those oceans . " To us . " If I could make one moment last forever , " this is the one I would choose ) ' I 'm glad you did . It was a good life . Kind of lonely , though ? Maybe ? I was never lonely . Not even for a minute . I guess we 'll never figure out what that glimmer is . Nope . Pretty , though . Hey , hey , wait ... It 's doing something . I 'll protect you . Hi ... Ow ! Professor ? You 're alive ? Yes , it 's me . Boy , did somebody hit you two with an old-and-ugly stick . I thought I killed you with the Time Button . I thought so , too , at first . But it seems I was simply rotated into an orthogonal time that runs at right angles to this one . I 've been tunneling for decades , searching every instant from yesterday to tomorrow . We 've been right now the whole time . I wasn 't looking for you , I was looking for the Time Button . Oh ! I landed on it and time froze . I tried to fix it once , but then I got mad and hit it some more . I guess it 's good we didn 't have children . Oh , give me that , you senile old idiot . Let me see ... That goes there ... Lefty loosey , righty tighty , and , fixed ! What ? I could 've fixed it that easily ? You ? Okay . I 've modeled the device to release a single huge antichroniton blast . It should rip us out of stasis , back to the instant before I conceived of the Time Button . You mean we 'll all get to live our lives over again ? Oh , my , yes . Even that nasty robot , what 's-his-name . Of course , we won 't remember anything that 's happened . What do you say ? Want to go around again ? I do .

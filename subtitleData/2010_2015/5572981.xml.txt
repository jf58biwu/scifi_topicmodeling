 Hey Art , let 's go . You ready for this ? You believe in doppelgangers , Angela ? Doppelgangers running around to confuse the issue ? No . How about twins ? Beth ever mention a twin sister ? What the hell is going on ? Look , we identified Sarah Manning as Jane Doe , so ... We gotta make a house call . Hey ... You mind keeping this between us ? Just till we figure out what the hell it is . - Yeah , sure . Yeah , sounds good to me . - Thanks . We can 't go back to the town house . Olivier 's boss , Dr. Leekie , is flying in today . He 'll be looking for you . Okay . For a second there , I forgot I was a clone . He thinks you are the one killing his clones . Sorry . Couldn 't afford lattes for Bonnie and Clyde . Morning , Fe . Can we torch this , please ? - What ? - Your psycho sister 's coat smells like low tide . Felix , Sarah 's gonna have to hole up here for awhile . You , too ? Impinging on my creativity . Shagging in my bed . - Alison . - Brilliant . Invite her , too . Then maybe we can all cuddle up with Weight Watchers and Grey 's Anatomy . - Hey . How was couple 's camp ? - I came back early . Cosima filled me in already , and I 'm taking a break from you two . I need to get my house together . Isn 't that what marriage counseling was for ? - Donnie and I are getting a divorce . - What ? I 'm fine . It 's my decision . - Everything is under control . - Okay , now I 'm worried . Well , don 't be . I can take care of myself and I don 't need you ... helping me clear my deck of liars and spies . Alison , you don 't know who your monitor is , okay ? Don 't fixate . I 'm reclaiming my life , Sarah . Please respect that . Aynesley , what are you doing ? Alison , you 're home . I told you I was coming back early . But not today , silly . I just came to water the plants . Did you ? I 'll get it . Hey . Hey , hey . Hey - What have I said about answering the door on your own ? Only when we invite someone . Uh huh , And we have not . Have we ? Kira , go up to your room . Quick . - Siobhan Sadler ? - Who wants to know ? Detectives Bell and Deangelis . Are you the legal guardian of Sarah Manning ? BBC America Orphan Black 01x08 - Entangled Bank Original Air Date - May 18 , 2013 Sarah 's dead ? I 'm sorry . She was shot . Shot . When ? On or around November 25th . November 25th , that 's two weeks ago . Identification took some time . Which you 're sure it 's her ? Did you know if Sarah had problems with anyone ? Women , especially , but not exclusively ? Why would you ask that ? I 'm sorry , we can 't share much about the investigation at this point . Did she live here with you ? No . She came of age and she moved out years ago . We aren 't ... We weren 't close . Did Sarah have a sister ? No . She was an orphan . Could she have a sister ? If she did , it would be news to both of us . Neolution is bullshit , Cosima . No , it isn 't , Sarah . It 's an applied philosophy with profound implications for what I do . So , you 'd go around black-bagging your subjects ? That was mistaken identity . Okay ? Olivier thought you were the killer , Sarah . Yes . Well , your good friend Dr. Leekie is on his way . Can I expect the same from him ? Okay . You know what ? You were the one who turned our killer against our creators . I mean , why the hell would you bring Helena into the mix ? Oi ! Ivory tower . This all happened because you got the science wrong . No , I didn 't . Yes , you did , okay ? They knew I wasn 't Beth from the medical tests . - You said our DNA was identical . - It is . You know , maybe it was your sunny personality that gave you away . Whose bloody side are you on , Cosima ? Well , hang up . She 's a freaky Leekie . Shit . Fe , Cosima drank the purple Kool Aid . Well , then to hell with her . But you can still save Alison . - Alison 's fine . - She 's not fine . - She 's divorcing Donnie . - It 's every freak for herself . Divorces do really strange things to normals , Sarah . They lose their fake happiness , they forget the way to the mall and then they come downtown to find themselves . - ls ) She 's obsessing that one of her bitchy friends is her monitor . Aynesley . It 's her for sure . Divorce ... You poor thing . - Where are the kids ? - They are at my mother 's . Do they know ? Did you tell them ? You 're just full of questions , aren 't you ? Well , of course I am . I care about you . - I know you were unhappy , but ... - How did you know ? By asking questions . Always asking , asking . Everything you know you pried right out of me . Here 's a thought . Why don 't you let me coach figure skating tonight ? The kids are with your mom ... Have a night in . Relax . No , you relax . Figure skating is on my schedule . And whether my daughter is in attendance or not , I 'll be there . Ali , I think you need some " me " time . And I think you need to give me my house keys back . What ? What have I done ? Keys , please . I know you 're in pain , so I won 't ask for my keys back . But I want you to know , I won 't abandon you , Ali . You know ... I 'm afraid restoring your brother 's appendage was out of the question . The tail was too badly damaged . Must have been a new one for you . Yes , but fascinating , actually . That level of surgical enhancement . He 's very committed . How long do you expect to keep him here ? Between the blood loss and the risk of infection in that area ... - A few days to a week . - Thanks , Doc . I 'll wait till he comes to . Where are you with Cosima ? Closer . She ... She made a pass at me , Aldous . Really ? Delphine ... Cosima 's safety is at stake . Other subjects , too . I need to know which ones she 's in contact with . But she has to initiate disclosure . I 'm not saying disclose . This is a direct threat . And so I need you to dig deeper , faster . " Dear Mummy , I miss you . " Mrs. S says , ' You are in the sunshine . ' " " Please come home . " " Love , Kira . " Oi ! Can you not , please ? I 'm not gonna hole up with you if you can 't sit still . - Does it smell ? - Yes , smells like a foot . Only worse , because it 's yours . Alison 's not picking up . Who 's calling ? Art , again . Sorry , Beth doesn 't live here anymore . No , she lives with me . So does her boy-toy bodyguard ... Stop ! Would you please stop ? - Oi , oi , Mrs. S. - Oi , oi . And you 're alive . Yeah . Why ? Two homicide detectives on my doorstep this morning quite convinced they 'd found your body in a gravel quarry . - Who wants mimosas ? - Sit down and shut your gob . I was tempted to clean the remains and feed them to you both on toast . Would you care to enlighten me ? I don 't want to lie to you , so ... Not yet . - What 'd they say ? - Very little . I 'd venture little is all they have . Thanks . Whatever is going on , if it takes one step towards Kira , you need to yell , " Fire . " The home we 've built for ourselves in this country , we burn it all down if we have to . That 's a promise . - Hey . - Hey . Facial reconstruction 's come along . - Hey , well , hang on to your hat . - Sounds promising . Sarah Manning offed herself . Jumped in front of a train at Huxley Station . - What ? - Check out the time of death . Two days before Jane Doe was shot . Jane Doe can 't be Sarah Manning . Sarah Manning was already dead . Except the prints match . Twins right ? Twins . Twins prints are close enough to flag a match . I mean , environmental factors like wear and tear can usually differentiate . Okay , but the foster mother said , no relations . That she knew of . Sarah was an orphan . Say , Beth 's a triplet separated at birth . Come on , humor me . Over a couple of days , same city , one suicides , the other gets whacked ? I mean , it suggests they 're in touch , they 're not separate anymore , right ? Then there 's only one left to clear it up . - Beth . - Hi , got your messages . Bad time ? So what 's this all about ? You miss me already ? Some questions came up about your work on the Jane Doe case . Such as ? Well , you told us there was no print match on the victim . Yeah , there wasn 't . Well , there 's no confirmation of that in the case file . There should be . We ran them again and we got a match . So , finally getting somewhere . Yeah , it sounds like it . Just need to know ... Is this a joke ? Does the name Sarah Manning mean anything to you ? Who the hell is this ? You 've never seen her before ? I ... Yeah , yeah . In the mirror . Come on , no . Hey , I guess people have look-alikes . Do they ? Alison ! Alison , how are you ? Poor hon . If you need anything , just call . My God , this is classic Aynsley . You can 't just put on an outfit and be a coach . You 're not the coach . You don 't know what you 're doing . - I 'm here every single ... - Ali , hey . - Hi , Chad . - Singlehood , free at last ? What are you doing here , Aynesley ? I know , right ? Chad , go play with your dumbbells . I told you I 've got this covered . You 're in no condition to be coaching the kids . Way to rub salt in the wounds , Aynes . Yeah . Sorry , I tried . I 'm perfectly fine . And no one asked you to sub for me , so leave . Alison , you 're mad at Donnie , not me . - I told you to stay away from me . - And I told you you 're not yourself . I know what you 're doing , Aynesley . You wanna mess with my life , I 'm gonna mess with yours . Sorry to be a bitch here . But it looks like you buried Jane Doe 's fingerprints to hide your connection . What connection ? I don 't have a sister . I don 't know who this person is . - Sarah Manning was an orphan . - Same prints as Jane Doe . But she killed herself days before Jane Doe was murdered . Look , Beth , we just need to know where you fit in . Can I see her file ? Sorry , you 're a civilian . Yeah , what you 've always wanted . Art , do I need to lawyer up here ? I don 't know , Beth . Do you ? Have forensics run her prints as fast as possible . Got it . Uh huh , oh Shit . Okay . Fine , you caught me . Just please don 't nark on me to Aynesley , you know how ape-shit she gets about stuff like this . Whoa . Alison . You know , Chad . This is the first hit I 've had since Godspell in college . I don 't know what that is . Okay ... Got any more ? Paul . Dr. Aldous Leekie will be here in a couple of hours . He texted you . You are conspiring with at least two clones . Just one , actually . Are you crazy ? Despite appearances , I 'm not the one in a compromising position here , Paul . You blackmailed an ex-military intelligence guy to do your dirty work . Olivier Duval . That 's a classy pseudonym , bro . Thank you . Your real name is Kevin . You 're from Wenatchee , Washington . You have a raft of unsavory sex warrants . The organization knows that . Yeah , but the police don 't . And that 's why you 're gonna listen when I tell you what happened last night . I get it . Smoke through the roof . Accelerated dissipation . Fewer air fresheners required . Speaking of fresh air , cheers to finally getting Donnie off your couch . Are you mocking the failure of my marriage , Chad ? Sorry . No , don 't be . I gather you and Aynesley aren 't exactly booking nooners . Hey , you know , the thing about you and me , Hendrix ... We 're sharks . We stop moving , we die . Yeah , you certainly got that down . Those late night runs in your sleeveless T 's . You ain 't so bad yourself . Tight glutes , nice pecs . - I bet you could bench press me . - Easy . I bet you could bounce me like a ball . You okay ? Maybe you 've had too much . Maybe you haven 't had enough . What are we doing here ? I 'm objectifying you , sexually , to get back at Donnie . I should really have a problem with this . But you don 't . Hey , Delphine . I ... I hope I 'm not disturbing you . No , no , no . No , impossible . So , apparently I 've got this thing for , like , um , jumping to conclusions . You know , it 's just that I 've never ... I know , I know , I know . You 're not gay . And I 'm a total idiot . So sorry . - Let me ... - Yes . Do you ... Yeah . I just wanna make like , crazy science with you . Totally crazy science . I 'm so glad to hear that because you know what ? I was reading up on the Dyad institute , and did you know that Dr. Leekie ... He has built a dedicated department for transgenic organ transplants and ... Sorry , I was just dorking out so hard to their extrapolation of murine models . - What ? - Yeah . Wow . You know , it 's really , really good to finally meet someone who gets it . Who gets ... Who gets me . Yeah , ditto . Obvs . I can 't stop thinking about that kiss . Like in a not bad way ? Like , I 've never thought about my sexuality . I mean , for myself , you know . But as a scientist I know that sexuality is a spectrum . But you know social bias is the ... The codified attraction . It 's contrary to the biological facts , you know ? That 's oddly romantic . Totally encouraging . Oh my God . You want me to coach you ? Okay . No . Let 's turn around right here now , girls . Go on . You 're in the end-zone . You 're in the end-zone . - Yeah , you 're my coach . - Touchdown ! ♪ When I start to make you nervous ♪ ♪ and I 'm going to extremes ♪ ♪ tomorrow , I will change ♪ ♪ and today won 't mean a thing ♪ ♪ I 'm a bitch , I 'm a lover ♪ ♪ I 'm a child , I 'm a mother ♪ ♪ I 'm a sinner , I 'm a saint ♪ ♪ I do not feel ashamed ♪ ♪ I 'm your hell , I 'm your dream ♪ ♪ I 'm nothing in between ♪ ♪ you know you wouldn 't want it ♪ ♪ any other way , yeah ♪ Get out !

You have no idea who you 're dealing with . No , I know exactly who you are . You 're a sleazy , watcher spy . Sleazy ? That 's rich coming from a back stabbing psycho-slut like you . Do you ... Stop it . Oi ! Ha-ha ! Hey , hey , hey , morgie . We need everything you got on Sarah Manning . Caucasian female , suicide by train . - You processed the body and its release . - I process lots of bodies . Is there a problem ? Fingerprints from our Jane Doe of the gravel crusher . Forensic says they 're spooky close to two other women . Yeah , one Sarah Manning , and other is a totally other woman . Let 's see . Sarah Manning , suicide by train . Holy shit . It 's uncanny . I need the name and the address of the person who identified her . What ? I ... Colin , please slow down . What exactly did they say ? I couldn 't fie , Felix . Okay , there are records , your signature , address ... Okay ... I gotta go . But you just take a hot bath , I will talk to you later . Shit ! Sarah ? You can handle this , yeah ? Cops ? Yeah ... I ... Where are you gonna go ? - ls ) No idea . Shit ! Felix , it 's me , Alison . Please be home . You effing kidding me . Bad things have happened to me . And I would love to hear about them . I would . Right now , you need to go . I can 't go back there . It 's just for one night , Alison . I slept with Aynesley 's husband . What ? I shagged Chad . And Aynesley attacked me in the middle of the street . I degraded myself , and I disgraced my children , and I can 't go back there . I seriously underestimated you . I hope you kicked her arse . I did . Kind of . I don 't wanna divorce Donnie , but I ... I can 't keep lying to him . And I hate lying to my kids , I hate it . How can we possibly sustain this insanity ? We can 't . I don 't know if Art 's gonna throw me in jail , or if Cosima 's gonna nark us out to the neolutionist . Um , don 't forget Helena , she 's always fun . All I know is , I came back to fix things . Be a real mum to Kira . So , what if we tell them ? You mean , come out ? I miss you , Mummy . I miss you , Mummy . I miss you , Mummy . I miss you , Mummy . Scotsburn Avenue , 148 . I replaced your security footage to show only one clone , Beth . Sarah was never there . He 's smart . It won 't work . It will , if you stick to one , there was only one . And you need to stop blaming yourself . How could you know ... - Dr. Leekie , I 'm ... - Paul Dierden . I hear great things . Aldous ... Aldous , she took my tail . Shut up , Olivier . You Okay ? Yes . You sure ? I ... I cry after sex with boys , too . Poor you . But you know what ? I am never this hungry . I could kill for some ice cream . Okay . Your wish is my command . I 'm gonna go to the store and I 'm gonna get us some Eskimo Pies . Eskimo ... Yeah . I don 't think I know it . - No ? - No . Prepare yourself , you 're about to become a craving addict . I think I already am . Merde . She dropped the Beth act cold right in front of us . If it weren 't for Paul , she would have killed me . She said her name was Helena . She had an accent , Slavic . She admitted she killed Beth and took over her life . Aldous , she is completely insane . Welcome to the big picture . Yes , sir . Sorry , guys . Visiting hours are over . Sure . We 'll ... We 'll get out of your way . And you just rest ... And heal . What did they say in the military , " You 've , you 've proven your mettle ? " No , sir , nobody ever said that . Okay . Well , tomorrow , I 'd like to talk to about next steps . Excuse me . Found something ? Promise me Cosima 's safe . Her quest , Aldous , is ... It 's all perfectly ... Perfectly natural . Delphine , believe me . I 'm protecting her . Now , what is it , then ? But she 's not only researching her own biology but she 's aware of eight others . She 's had contact . I need names . Yes . Well , some of them seem to be dead . - Um , Janika Zingier . - Yes . Danielle Fournier . Yes . - Yes . - Katja Obinger . - Yes . - Helena . But there 's no last name , um ... Helena . There 's Alison Hendrix , Beth Childs and Sarah Manning . Sarah Manning . Anything else on her ? No , nothing . Listen , I have to go . She 's coming . Bye . Hello ? What happened ? You okay ? Yeah , it 's time , Siobhan . Time I told you what 's really going on . Well , then , I am all ears . Siobhan , this is Alison Hendrix . Pleased to meet you . Well , tell me more , love . I mean , it can 't get any stranger than human cloning . Well , um , we live in Scarborough . About a million years ago , I went to university . You went to university ? Yes , kinesiology . Where 'd you go wrong ? That 's just basically massage therapy , innit ? No . Sarah , it 's very important . It heals . No . Um , and then I got married . And everything is shit . She came to see Kira once in your place , didn 't she ? I knew something was up . Yeah , sorry . The crazy one , Helena , was after me . Okay , so , Helena , Alison , Cosima , Beth is the ... - The police woman ? - Yeah . Who topped herself , yeah . - You . - Now there 's probably thousands of us . Unless Helena 's killed them all . We 're all messed up . Except you , Sarah . I am the biggest mess there is , Alison . No , no , no , no . Because you say , " ' F ' it . " I tried to say , " ' F ' it " today and I blew up my whole life . I just wanted to say , " ' F ' this . ' F ' you . " And I F 'ed it . I F 'ed it all up . You know , would you like to see the guest bedroom at this point , chicken ? Come on . Yes . You 're so lovely . You know , you 're very lucky , Sarah . My mother wouldn 't be this lovely . She would ... My mother would have me put in , therapy . Yeah , yes . That 's Sarah . I was just so shocked . Seeing her like that on that slab , looking so ... Dead , really . So your foster sister didn 't have any sisters ? Just me . I keep asking myself , " What did I miss ? " you know . 'Cause I never really saw the signs . Beth Childs . Who 's that ? Mind if I look ? I like art . No ... Yeah , um , by all means . Those are the many sides of Sarah . I call that series " Twisted Sister . " Ilike them . - It 's all working out your grief . - Yes . Wherever it takes me . Thanks . And sorry again , for your loss . Thank you . I 've been here before . What does that mean ? Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Harley , you pervy bastard , I know that 's you . Last night , I get a phone call . Some punk with an English accent says he wants to talk about Beth . Then he hangs up . - Let 's bring him in . Let 's shake his tree , man . - No , it 's too early . I wanna get a better picture of this whole deal first . What are you doing ? - Any loss of sensation in your feet ? - No . Just checking . Get some rest . And Dr. Leekie sends his regards . I know there 's more here . Between the lines . What is that you need , Sarah ? How can I help ? Well , Alison , Cosima , Beth , their mothers all wanted babies enough to do in vitro . So why did mine give me up ? There were rumors ... Yeah ? That some of the kids we were hiding , the ones that ... came in Carlton 's pipeline , like you , children in the black ... What do you mean exactly , " in the black " ? You know undocumented , outside the system , rumor was these kids were the subject of medical experiments . Carlton 's pipeline . - What kind of experiments ? - I don 't know , love . It was a paranoid time in a radical fringe . Everything was rumor then . Carlton brought me to you . Wouldn 't he know who my birth mother was ? He may , but even if he did he might not tell me . - Do your contacts still know him ? - It 's ... It 's possible . Can you get in touch with him ? It 's 15 years ago . Last I heard , he was in prison . I 'll try . - Just wanna know who I am . - You 're still you . Remember that . You 're a survivor . Kira ? It 's Helena . Kira ? Kira ! Kira ! Where are we going ? I 'm taking you to meet someone . How can you be Sarah 's daughter , child ? How can that be ? Kira ! Stop ! You 're just like my mum . No , I 'm not . She 's not real . Of course she is . Kira ! Helena ... Yes , angel ? What happened to you ? I don 't know . Kira ! - Kira ! - I should go home now . Yes . - Do you know the way ? - Of course . Goodnight , angel . - Kira ! - Mommy ! Watch out ! No ! Seven-year-old female struck by vehicle , GCS three . Chest injury , possible internal bleeding . Stay with me , baby , please . Bet you 100 bucks , I know who she 's gonna look like when Beckwith is done with the reconstruction . You got no charge that will stick , yet . Why is Sarah still alive ? Tell her . Someone tampered with the security footage at club Neolution . I know there were two clones there that night , weren 't they ? - Oh my God . - Alison . What ? What is this ? We 're gathered in spirit of love and understanding .

Mate , I just want burger with cheese and bacon , that 's all . - So , you want bacon as well ? - What , I can 't fucking have bacon now ? No , you can . I just need to ... It doesn 't come with cheese and bacon , so I just need to add it . Well , add it , then . Stop backchatting me . I 'm not . Honestly . - I 'm not . - Look at you . Grown man flipping burgers . Is this what you wanted do with your life ? Fucking ... Terrence . Is it , Terrence ? Is it ? Hmm ? ( PRINTER WHIRS ) ( PRINTER WHIRS AND STOPS ) Janus wasn 't in Utopia . It was in me . My own dad did that to me . Nice jacket . How come a knob-face like you has suddenly grown a ... Grant , for fuck 's sake ! We 're doing something . Just piss off ! MILNER : When lan discovers that we 've killed Roy ... WILSON WILSON : Killed ? No , wait . Just hang on a minute . Michael ... I 'm going to help you get your family back . MILNER : I 'm going to call either Paul or one of the other two , and in about 90 days that person will release the most deadly flu this world has ever seen . I chose . You mean , a race ? You chose a race ? And which race did you choose ? Dovada . Dovada . - IAN : What does that mean ? - MARIUS : Dovada means " proof " . It means " proof " . - ( GUNSHOT ) - ( THEY GASP ) You 're coming with us . Grant ! Lan ? Lan ! Lan , please ! Lan , what are you doing ? I 'm getting Grant back . What ? Are you trying to find a weapon ? Is that it ? Right . Well , that 's a curtain pole , lan . You 've got a curtain pole . - On , so you just wanna leave him ? - Pietre is a killing machine . If he wanted to kill Grant , Grant would be dead . We all would . We won 't find him . So , let 's just calm down and work out what to do next . WOMAN ON TV : ... is now on the coast of South Korea , leaving a whole host of other military vessels - in what the Americans ... - Oh , that ... that 's not very good . - We 're not getting fucking married . - No , no , she was smiling . - ... China 's threat to dump ... - Don 't smile . - ... if the US doesn 't stay out of ... - You just have to ask , Jessica . ( CAMERA CLICKS ) JESSICA : Who does he send that to ? MILNER : Leah Gorsand , Rochane Foundation . Are you really Mr Rabbit , then ? Surprising , isn 't it ? ... secretary describing it as a declaration of war in all the ... I see the Americans are entering the Yellow Sea . That 's a worrying escalation . So , that story about you in China , escaping , killing all those people , is that true , then ? Are you asking me , " am I a killer " , Michael ? Yes , I am . I didn 't want to be . It 's just the way it turned out . - Like Churchill or Lincoln . - Or Hitler . MILNER : Always surprises me how quickly these things escalate . One minute , it 's a disagreement about wheat and land rights , and the next it 's a nuclear standoff . Jen and Alice are dead , by the way . You 're killing them . Right now . This minute . Or you could untie me . Don 't send that from here , OK ? Tell them to back off , or she dies , and if I even smell them near my dad or lan , she 's dead . I don 't want any attention drawn to them ... - Roy Johnson , brother of lan Johnson ... ... none . - ... has been found murdered . - Too late . - The body was discovered ... - Whoops . ... in a warehouse . Police say the victim was tied to a chair and killed with a single gunshot to the head . IAN : Becky ? Do you think he had family ? We need to get rid of him . Our DNA 's all over this place . What , like ... dispose ? So , we get rid of bodies now ? We 're like killers ? I 'll do it . You ... find out how to get rid of the DNA . Yeah . Oh , my God . Lan . I 'm so sorry . Whoa . Whoa , whoa . What do I do about Jen and Alice ? I mean , I have to get them out now . You ... you said you 'd help me . I can 't stay . I planted a phone on lan . The battery will run out . My dad 's with him . I have to , Michael . Look , find out where they have them . Take a mobile , the GPS . They search me . They fucking search me . How do I get a phone in there ? Shove it up your arse . No , I 'm serious . You have to shove it up your arse . It 's the only way . Don 't use a big one . ( DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS ) So ... th-they 're saying I ... I killed him ? Lan , I 'm so sorry . No , no , no , it 's ... it 's all right . Um ... I mean , it 's ... it 's fine , it 's just ... So ... so what ? He 's ... he 's dead ? Right ... right . Yeah , um ... so , what ... what were we doing ? We 're ... And ... and Marius , I ... I need to get rid of ... - lan . - No , no , no . No . What does my mum think ? She ... she thinks you did it . What ? Should ... should I tell her I ... I didn 't , then ? You can 't go near her . That 's what they want you to do . Oh . Um ... So , I was doing ... I was doing something and ... Oh , yeah . Bl-bleach . Bleach . Um ... I was ... I was bleaching ... ( GASPS ) ( HE SOBS ) So , what 's the plan , then ? I don 't have a plan . ( ARBY WHEEZES ) I know this area . It 's remote . There 's an old base . I trained there as a boy . Sometimes they would take me out here on the hills . Holidays , I suppose . So , what , we 're just gonna wander round like fucking twats ? If we meet anyone , behave yourself . ( ARBY WHEEZES ) I 'm your dad . He 's your grandfather . ( SCOFFS ) You 're my dad ? All right , Dad ? - Were you going to kill lan , then ? - You shouldn 't talk about killing . Why not ? I 'm not like other people now . I 'm different , like you . You are not like me . Yes , I am . Why am I not ? Come on . We 're leaving . Why am I not like you ? Oi , dickhead ! Why am I not like you ? ( DOOR SLAMS ) ( MUTTERS ) There are no clues as to where it is . Curtains closed , so you can 't see out . There is a child 's drawing . It 's called " Ice " . Ice ? Have you shown this to anyone else ? I didn 't think panic was good . Why me ? Why show me ? She believes in you , dear . Janus is at a critical stage . Commands need to be given . By Mr Rabbit . But no-one knows she is Mr Rabbit . I mean , she must lead at arm 's length , like , what ? Dead drops and codes and ... Yes , there is a complicated and highly secretive command structure . And do you know it ? I know ... some of it . Tell no-one . And Mr Rabbit ? For the moment , we are Mr Rabbit . ( BIRDSONG OUTSIDE ) ( SIGHS ) Mm . ( TAPPING ) ( TAPPING ) ( HE PANTS ) ( BREATHES HEAVILY ) ( IAN TAPPING BRICKS ) ( SNIFFS ) - ( GASPS ) - Becky ? I ask question , yes ? Is there something here ? Is mark ? ( SHE GASPS ) Tell you what . Is OK . I can keep my chips in there . ( WHISPERS ) Oh , God , please ... ( GASPS ) Eat my fucking chip ! ( BECKY PANTS ) ( SHE WHIMPERS ) ( BECKY GASPS ) - Are you all right ? - I ... I don 't know where Donaldson is . The Thoraxin 's experimental . He said it 's like a secret lab in China . I tried to find it once . No good . And without it ? Look . There ... there 's gonna come a time ... I mean , if ... if I want a choice then I 'm gonna need to do it when I 'm well enough . Will you help me please ? Come on , let 's go and find out what side Dugdale 's on . ( SHE SHUDDERS ) ( ARBY WHEEZES ) GRANT : It 's fucking nice , all this . Mountains and shit . Yeah ... ( SNIFFS ) ... I like this . ( GRUNTS ) What is it ? I remember a stone hut somewhere near . I thought it had grass on the roof , but they said " moss " . It was nice . The kind of place a father takes a son . Is that where we 're going ? You and me ? ( ARBY WHEEZES ) ANTON : Acesta este mirt de mlastina . Bun pentru a tine insectele la distanta . ( WHEEZES ) Si puteti sa-I mananci . ( CLICKS TONGUE ) Mm ? - ( WHEEZES ) - ANTON : Eh ? Ah . Ha-ha ! Come on , you dumb bastard . - ( WHEEZES ) - Let 's go find this stupid fucking hut . - ( CLOCK TICKS ) - ( BELL CHIMES ) ( BELL CHIMES ) ( HE SIGHS ) ( BELL CHIMES ) - ( BELL CHIMES ) - ( SNIFFS ) ( BELL CHIMES ) ( SNIFFS ) ( CROWS CAW ) WILSON WILSON : There 's no ice . Sun . Fields . A horse . There 's no ice in this . Something has come up . What ? What 's come up ? LEAH : Newsprint . How very traditional ! I mean , they know . So , we have to pay and this isn 't a large amount . 20 million in cash is large . GEOFF : Yes , but we can do it . I mean Janus . We 've all worked so hard ... They don 't say what denomination . Dollars . Sterling . - Euros . - Sterling . It 's sterling . I mean , we 're in England . Of course he wants sterling . WILSON WILSON : Really ? Our highest denomination is the L50 note , one million of which would weigh 24.2kg. 20 million would weigh nearly half a tonne . Now compare that to the 500 euro note , which would be just 45 kilos . He could fit it into a suitcase . If he 's a he . Look , where is she ? I 'm a minister . Why aren 't I talking to her ? We 'll pay . You 're right . Janus is more important than everything . Did you want something else ? Er ... no . I didn 't think he was this stupid . Oh , he 's not stupid . He 's just ... He 's just desperate . Ice . ( SNAP ) ( SIGHS ) ( LOCK CLICKS ) DUGDALE : Oh , ya bastard ! ( SNIFFS ) ( DOOR OPENS ) ( BREATHES HEAVILY ) I 'm not with them . They have Jen and Alice . I 've had no choice . Oh ! Just ... Look ... look around . They 're not here ! - Lan . - They 've got Jen and Alice . Lan , shall I take that ? Look , I think he might be telling the truth . Shall ... shall I take that knife , then ? OK . I think we all need to talk . DUDGALE : So , all this is sort of ... racist ? Well , does anybody else know ? No , just us . We think if we take them that ... I mean , they have a virus , Russian flu . They 're gonna ... No , no , no , they faked that . No , they 're not faking it this time . It 's real . That 's how they get everyone to take the vaccine . And this is proof ? We think it shows what Carvel did to it , like the racist bit . We reckon if ... if we take them that , then they might , like ... stop . Or they might kill us . So , Milner ... Milner 's Mr Rabbit ? She 's responsible for ... for all this ? She played us . Jessica has her now . She 's gone to find you , in fact . They think you have Carvel . She hid a phone in your jacket . Shit . Grant 's wearing my jacket . Well , hang on . When did she hide a phone in your jacket ? Oh , I ... l-I came here . I saw her . - BECKY : Right . You never said . - Well , yeah , I didn 't get time . - I beg your fucking pardon ? ! - Sorry , is this really the time ? No , shut up , you ! Why didn 't you say ? ( TYRES SCREECH ) - ( DOOR SLAMS ) - ( VOICES ON POLICE RADIO ) No , this ... this isn 't me . I swear to Christ . Go ! Go ! Go ! - Come on ! - Oh , my God ! - ( DOOR SLAMS ) - Armed police ! Get on the floor ! Down on the floor ! Get down ! Do not move ! ( SHOUTING ) ( SHE WHIMPERS ) All right ? ( ARBY WHEEZES ) Eurgh . - He gave that to you . - So what ? It 's fucking stupid . You shouldn 't swear so much . It 's not good on a child . I 'm not a child , you cock . Oh , shit . We gotta kill ' em now . Just behave and don 't swear . ( WHEEZES ) Hello there . Go fuck yourself , fuck-chops . ( ARBY WHEEZES ) Fucking tell me what to do . Uh ! Go on , do it . You lost your bottle . They saw us . You 're wandering around to find some fucking hut to show your daddy . He can 't even remember you . - You should be quiet now . - Why ? What you gonna do ? Shoot me ? I 'm already dead , me . Anyway , you can 't kill your partner . - You are not my partner . - Yes , I am . - I 'm like you now . - You are not like me . - Stop saying that ! I am . - ( WHEEZES ) Give me the gun . Give me the gun and I 'll go back and show you . ANTON : Pietre ? Pietre ? ( DEPARTING FOOTSTEPS ) ( LAPTOP BEEPS ) There 'll be no reception soon . How will you find them ? I 'll figure it out . I imagine you will . The way you escaped was ... was incredible , Jessica . There 's still time to come with us . You don 't seem to get the dynamic here . You 're tied , I 've a knife and a gun , and I 'm going to kill you . So , why am I still alive ? Are you scared he won 't talk to you ? Has it been on your mind ? The adjustment ? Do you keep wondering what it was he put inside you ? Don 't lose control of yourself , Jessica , when you see your father . Your feelings ... ( BLADE RASPS ) What if I lose control now ? You think I 'm scared of being hurt ? Why do you think we did this ? Philip was a genius but we sacrificed everything for this . - Including me ? - Oh . Your generation 's so self-absorbed . There 'll be no statue to Philip Carvel . No-one 'll know his name . But we 'll all survive because of him . You won 't . ( WHISPERS ) You won 't survive . ( BREATHES HEAVILY ) WILSON : And I 'm supposed to believe this ? Where 's Milner ? Wilson , you need to take them seriously . What they 're saying is ... - Where is Milner ? - What , you gonna torture us , Wilson ? Yeah . I might . I might do , Becky . BECKY : Russian flu is real . It 's some psychopathic weaponised virus from the ' 60s , and they 're going to release it , did you know that ? - What ? You did ? You knew ? - We have a vaccine . But some will die , won 't they ? DUGDALE : How many , Wilson ? How many people will die ? I tell you what . Let 's just get solar panels . Recycle our paper . Let 's just go to bottle banks . - You sound like Letts . - Letts was right ! Your problem is that you want to think that the world is nice , that we can all just get along , co-operate ! When the fuck have we ever done that ? ! BECKY : Wilson , Janus is not going to do what you think . It 's a form of eugenics . The numbers ... I 'm here for Milner . I know she was with Jessica , I know she was here , and I know you know how to find her , so I 'll ask you again . - Where ... - Is Mr Rabbit . Where is Mr Rabbit ? Leave us a moment . Why not let me have a go , Wilson ? I can be very effective . - You know that more than anyone . - I said " leave us " . ( SIGHS ) Aye-aye , skipper . Jesus Christ , why did you say that ? - If he heard you ... - My brother was murdered yesterday . I 'm not grieving . I 'm not trying to get in touch with my mum to see how she is . I 'm not sitting and thinking of all the good times . I 'm here , trying to get in touch with the people who murdered him . I 'm here because of the numbers on that drawing . So , you need to fucking listen , Wilson ! WILSON : OK . I 've sent it to Leah . We 'll wait . But if that comes back as nothing , you are going to tell me how to find Milner . One way or another . Cock-face . ( MURMURS ) - ARBY : Do you know who I am ? - ( ANTON MURMURS ) You ask him . Do you know who he is ? - No . Say " l " . - ( ANTON MURMURS ) - Do you know who I am ? - Yes . You 're my son . Pietre . No , let him touch you . ( ARBY WHEEZES ) Why did you leave me ? This is fucking creepy , mate . You weren 't human . You were horrific . ( STONES CLATTER ) ( ANTON MURMURS ) Where 's Dad ? It 's good to see you again . I was worried about you . I missed you . I 'm sorry about your brother , lan . You shouldn 't blame yourself . I don 't . I don 't blame myself . I blame you , you and your friends . At least you 've lost someone now , like me and Becky have . What the fuck is wrong with you ? ! ( DOOR CLICKS ) ( LOW VOICES ) I have to get Jen and Alice out now . Milner said she 'd kill them if I didn 't help her . If she comes back ... I need help . - ( LOW VOICES ) - Please ? BECKY : So ? That prove what we say ? Er ... yes . You are right . It is exactly as you say . The numbers show the adjustment . Great . So , you can stop it , right ? BECKY : What ? What is it ? They also show something else . Something worse . Much , much worse . - How much fucking worse ? - WILSON WILSON : We have to find Milner . We have to stop her now . - ( ARBY WHEEZES ) - Jessica . If he moves , shoot him . We 're family . There 's no need for that . Aim for his chest . ( ARBY WHEEZES ) ( SHE SOBS ) What you did to me ... Jessica ? ( SOBS ) You ... You know me ? The eyes . I know the eyes . Don 't touch me . Don 't you fucking touch me . ANTON : I love you . ( SHE BREATHES HEAVILY ) ( SOBS ) I love you . It was always like that . He only ever had eyes for her . She ruined everything for you and me . ( ARBY WHEEZES ) ( FAINT BEEPING ) Do you want me to drive ? ( FAINT BEEPING ) IAN : We 're doing things our way now . You should have let us bring people with us . They 're dangerous . ( TOILET FLUSHES ) ( DUGDALE SIGHS ) We 've got to get you out of here now . This , erm ... will give me your position . You 'll have to take a panel off one of the windows . I 'm not sure which one . I 'II ... I 'll text you . It 's on silent , but make sure nobody hears the buzzer . Alice , can you , er ... make yourself sick ? - I feel like vomiting all the time . - Good girl . Right . They 're in that building , fourth floor . There 's a window up there . I think it 's a bathroom . You get out that way and you avoid all the security . I 'll be waiting . And if no-one kills us , then I think we should be fine . - Thanks for doing this , Becky . - Ah . ( PHONE BEEPS ) ( PHONE VIBRATES ) ( VOMITS AND COUGHS ) JEN : Alice ? ( ALICE COUGHS ) ( WHISPERS ) Shit . ( WHISPERS ) Jesus Christ , Michael ! You first , Alice . I have a heights thing . L-I can 't do that . I just can 't . You have a heights thing ? You ... you never mentioned it before . We 've not been high up before . - We ... we went on the London Eye . - That was OK . It was an enclosed space . She has a fucking heights thing , Michael . - ( KNOCK AT DOOR ) - GUARD : You OK in there ? - Yes ! - Right . Right . OK , OK . Plan B. JEN : I think she 's sick . She 's really sick . Can you call for a doctor ? OK . I 'll call . Yaah ! Get up . Get up ! - Right . Right . Right , give me ... - ( GUN CLICKS ) Here . Let 's swap . Go on , here . Right . You give ... give me the code - or I 'll kill you . - I don 't think you will . See , people like you , you don 't do this kind of stuff . It 's not in you . See , I don 't think ... - ( MUFFLED SCREAMS ) - Give him the fucking code ! - Hi , Becky . - Hey , Alice . Lovely to see you . Scared of heights , then , eh ? That 's a turn-up for the fucking books , innit ? - BECKY : You OK ? Are you all right ? - Yeah . Go ! ( THUNDER RUMBLES ) ( HE MURMURS ) ARBY : He 's not well . I think things are coming back to him . But it 's slow . What 's the adjustment ? Ochii tai . - Te rog ! Te rog , nu ... - You 're scaring him , Jessica . He speaks to Grant . He thinks he 's me . ARBY : You can trust me . You know that . You put Janus in me . You did that to your own daughter . I did . I had to . - He says that ... - I know what he said , Grant . ANTON : I only wanted to protect you . Protect me ? - You sterilised me . - ANTON : No . I saved you . I saved you , my darling . Everything was to save you . ( ANTON BREATHES HEAVILY ) Musai te zhav . Nashti ... - What 's going on ? What is it ? - I don 't know . - This is too much for him . - Noi trebuie sa ne omoram ! Philip ! - Noi trebuie sa ne omoram ! - Philip ! It 's me . You haven 't changed . You haven 't changed a bit , Milner . I have . Lots . And so have you . Let me speak to him alone , Jessica . He doesn 't know you . He 'll talk to me . - No fucking way ! - MILNER : Oh , Christ , Jessica ! I 'm tied . You 've got guns and knives . What can I do ? We both need to find out what he did to it . We both need to know . It 's lovely to see you , Grant . You 've grown . How have you been ? Did you miss Jessica ? It 's not easy caring for someone like her . I know that . You turned me into a ghost . What if I did the same to you ? I don 't think that 's the sort of person you are . I believe you were told to give us some space . ( HE SNIFFS ) ( SHE SIGHS ) - ( BIRDSONG ) - ( ARBY WHEEZES ) So , do you have a plan , then ? Not really . I just thought I 'd keep moving and hope that something occurred . I didn 't know it would be you . How did you find us ? There 's no reception . I met an old couple down below , said a boy swore at them . ( ARBY WHEEZES ) - He 's a massive pain in the arse . - He is . ( ARBY WHEEZES ) You 've lost weight . It 's nice . Don 't like that beard , though . ANTON : You have everything in place ? All ready to go ? MILNER : Everything you planned , it 's all happening . What did you do to Janus , Philip ? I located a racial grouping in Southeast Asia . Lower incidence of ... of cancer , heart disease . Violence ... less . I felt ... - ( WIND WHISTLES ) ... they were perfect . And you chose them ? I ... I wanted to . I did . But at the very last moment I changed my mind . I chose my own . Roma . Roma are the people that Janus will leave fertile . I chose , Milner . I 'm so , so sorry . I said you were a god . And you were . Why shouldn 't you choose ? You 're not angry ? ( SIGHS ) Do you remember that beautiful separation we felt ? The biggest secret in the world . Just us . That feeling 's never left , and now I know I was always waiting . For what ? For you . ( SHE INHALES ) We 're nearly there , Philip . We just have one last thing to do . ( SNIFFS ) ( GASPS ) I have this for you . ( HE SNIFFS ) ( HE WHEEZES ) The person who did this was very good . ( GUNSHOT ECHOES ) Run , Jessica ! Please ? ( GUNSHOTS ) ( GUN CLICKS ) ( ROPE SNAPS ) ( BLADE CLINKS ON GROUND ) Now it 's just you and me . ( JESSICA PANTS ) You 'll be all right . OK ? ( SHE SOBS ) Breathe ! Breathe ! Milner ! Wilson , thank Christ it 's you . I want you to meet a great man . This is Philip Carvel . What ? He 's Philip Carvel ? Have you given the command yet ? The command to release Russian flu . Have you given it ? Yes , I have . Why ? Christ . Oh , Jesus fucking ... You have to reverse it . Janus isn 't random . He changed it . - Yes , I know . - You know ? I don 't agree with the adjustment he made , I don 't , but it 's only going to cost a few thousand lives and we will have ... Is that what he told you ? Tell her what you found out . Janus stops the vaccine from working . No . No , no , no , that 's not ... Listen to me . The flu vaccine we have is practically useless . He 's right . I discovered that Janus hijacks the vaccine . It attaches itself to it . So , it means that when you 're vaccinated , the antibodies you create to fight the flu are the wrong shape . They won 't work . Unless ... Unless ? Unless you are Roma . The vaccine does what Janus does . Only Roma will be protected . My love for Jessica was like a physical thing , an organ that didn 't exist until she was born and then it controlled everything . You did this for her ? ! - But we tested it . It worked ... - On Jessica . She 's Roma . Whoever you called to release it , you have to call him back . Just a minute . Let ... let me think . WILSON WILSON : What 's there to think about , Milner ? Make the call . Dekendra Bilotti . Access XYL52721 . Commence . WILSON WILSON : What ? - But you said ... - ( KEYPAD BEEPS ) You hadn 't called him ? It 's not what I wanted . Not at all . All those lives . - MILNER : It is unfortunate . - Unfortunate ? ! The Russian flu vaccine doesn 't work . That 's millions of lives . Hundreds of millions , even . And there are seven billion on this planet . 100 million won 't even make a dent . We 're trying to save the species . If it costs a few million individuals , isn 't that OK ? It 's not fucking OK ! Call back ! Call him back now ! Stop him ! I told you to call him back . You can 't shoot me . I 'm the only one who knows who he is . No , no , it 's fine . I understand . I understand completely . ( GUNSHOT ) ( MILNER GASPS ) Throw the gun . Get on your knees . Now ! It 's easy , this . You 're next , mate . - Grant , don 't ! Don 't . Please ? - Why ? Why not you as well ? Because ... I 'm asking you . Please ? ( ANTON SOBS ) - Fuck . - It 's all right . - GRANT : What have I done ? - IAN : Shh . No , no , no , no , no . ( SOBS ) It 's wrong ... - ( MUSIC PLAYS ) - ( LOW CHATTER ) MAN : Hey ! Hey , you ! I 'm talking to you . You can 't take a call , not when you 're serving . Who the fuck are you , taking a call when ... And who the fuck do you think you ... Hey ! I 'm talking to you ! Who the fuck are ya ? Eh ? Who the fuck are ya ?

 It would seem our fates are on a collision course . Find Dyson Frost yesterday . The next move is Mark Benford 's . Dyson Frost ? It 's your move . I took this picture . She saw something she shouldn 't have and got in trouble with Jericho . The second that Jericho knows that I 'm still alive ... They 'll find me , and they 'll kill me . I know you took her . Now you 're gonna give her back . - I can 't give you your daughter back . - Then we go to war . You will be shot 3 times on march 15th . It will be your gun , Agent Benford . The box is here , but the gun is gone . My first term was a bitch . I could have used you , Stan . I 'm sorry I couldn 't bring you in . I don 't want you to think I 'm harassing you . I know . You 're just trying to save the world . Good-bye . She was signaling her handlers . I should have known ... Two moles , in case one is caught ... And not one person in the office would suspect it 's you . Today is more than just the beginning of your career . Today , along with a badge and a gun , you 're gonna get a story about your first day on the job . Every special agent has one . Some are funny . Some are tragic . Some are boring . But today won 't be the most important day in your career as an FBI agent . That day is somewhere down the line . You won 't see it coming . It sneaks up on you . It 'll most likely be an anonymous moment . A crossroads where you 're asked to do something , make some kind of personal sacrifice for the good of someone else , and that person may never know your name or see your face or even understand what you did . But you 'll know . And isn 't that why you 're here , after all ? Because you can be counted on to do the right thing at the right time , every time . Welcome to the FBI . Well done . Nicely done . All right , ladies and gentlemen . See me for your partner assignments . Congratulations . Nicely done . Special Agent Vreede ... Is it " vreed-y " or " Vreede " as in " freed " ? I don 't know . I got Benford . - Switch with me . - Why ? He 's a legend . Surveillance , counterterrorism , trafficking . Do it . Whatever , but you gotta take it up with Wedeck and get it approved . Done . Thank you . - Of course . - Yes ! - Janis , who 'd you get ? - No partner . Headed to analysis . Boring . I got it worse . I report to you . How could that be ? I scored higher . Yeah , in , like , one category . Come on , Marcie . We 'll have fun . We 've been a team since Quantico ... Booze and bullets . - What am I , the mascot ? - No , you 're like our captain . You 'll probably outpace all of us . I 'm sure of it . Yeah , we 're sure . Interview of Marcie Turoff , Agents Benford and Noh questioning . March 12 , 2010 . We 'd like to know ... Who came after us in that parking garage in DC ? I don 't know . Who came after us in the parking garage in DC ? I don 't know . - On to the next . - Are they still after us ? I don 't know . - Who killed Ian McKinnon ? - Demetri . Come on . Let 's go . Is that who 's coming after me ? Let 's go . We need those answers . There are a whole lot of other ones we need to get to first . Listen , Dem . You think I don 't have march 15th circled in my calendar , too ? We both know there 's a chance you 'll die in three days . Look , you keep chasing down leads . I 'll let you know when we 're ready for your questions , all right ? Janis , I need your help in here with Marcie . Me ? What , you got something more important than grilling our mole ? No . Of course not . What were your duties ? Every week , I 'd take whatever information there was in the mosaic investigation and leave it at a dead drop . Who recruited you ? I was approached by a man three months before the blackout hit . What was his name ? All in due time . He asked if I wanted to be a part of something big . And you said yes . You think I sold out my friends and my country , but ... you don 't know me . Why don 't you enlighten us ? Come on . Don 't you remember my flash-forward ? No , you don 't , 'cause neither of you ever bothered to ask me what I saw . I was incarcerated . That didn 't cross your mind when you shot six of your fellow agents ? It did . But even though I was in jail , I was happier than I 've been in years . I thought we 'd have to beg for life without parole . I told you they 'd come around . Until I tell them who recruited me , I 'm indispensable . For the first time since I got here , I actually felt like I was important . I need you Mark . These are our guests from washington . And while they 're grateful for all our efforts in apprehending Agent Turoff ... You gotta be kidding . Director Middleton feels more comfortable having such a highly valued target where he can keep an eye on her . And where he can give the press conferences himself . Hear me out . We know her . We can read her . Just give us one more day . I know it 's frustrating , but let 's try to get something positive done today . Like maybe get back to what caused the blackout . I 'll be out of the office for a couple of hours , so give me an update . Dyson Frost . He 's our best lead so far . Where are we ? I 've left 4 messages . Haven 't heard back . I 'm afraid he 's just toying with us . He 's been wanting to talk for 19 years , and now he 's playing hard to get ? Shel , see what you can get by tracing Frost 's phone . I just got a call from LAPD . They 've got a ballistics report saying that Mark 's gun , that 's supposed to kill me in three days , was used in a murder last night . - = Blackout Team = - Saison 1 Ã‰pisode 16 - = Let No Man Put Asunder = - So what do we know from the eyewitness reports ? 55-year-old , in his cot , presumably asleep . At 3 : 33 am , the shooter walked up to him , and a couple of insomniacs heard the victim say ... I knew it would be you . I just didn 't want to believe . The shooter must have had a silencer on your gun . He plugged him three times in the chest at close range . Do you want to put that thing away ? - Sorry . - Thanks . Physical description ranging from ... 5 ' 5 " white guy to a 6 ' indian . - Another dead end . - Wasn 't there something about a car ? Somebody said they saw a 1970s blue sedan drive away ... Foreign make . That 's a start . LAPD 's gonna forward the victim 's effects to us . Can 't wait to sift through that . Forget about the shooter . Who 's the one other person we know who handled that gun ? There were 40 agents in that evidence room . They were all cleared months ago . One of those agents is Marcie ? Stop ! - Stop ! - You guys never give up . - I need to talk to her . - She 's in our custody . - She 's part of our investigation . - I 'm just doing my job . - Who 'd you give my gun to , Marcie ? - I don 't know . - Who has it ? - I don 't know . Come on . Don 't do this . We were friends . Look , I 'm sorry . Really , I am . All I heard is that you 're supposed to die in LA . What ? Give me more specifics . Who does it ? When ? It was a voice on the phone when I called to report the gun in lockup . - Who 'd you call ? - A number . It was different every time . Look , that 's all I know . There isn 't any more . You 're gonna die in three days , there 's nothing you can do to stop it . I 'm sorry . Come on . Marcie , come on . Come on , come on ! Sweetie , what is the hurry ? We 're here . I told him we 'd be here by 2 : 00 . We 're late . - Who ? - Dylan ! Nuts to you , Squirrlio ! Come on , Dylan ! I 'm coming . Did you know about this ? Absolutely not . Charlie , who arranged this ? I did ! I got Dylan 's phone number from him in the hospital . He was very insistent about this specific park , and now I know why . Do you normally come here ? The house is just around the corner . Right . - This is fun . - You go first . - I can sit on a bench . - Fine . Doesn 't have to be that way . - What happened ? - Let me see . We bonked heads . - Did he hit your teeth ? - Let me see , baby . - Let 's see . Open up . - I 'm bleeding . Let me see . - She okay ? - Open your mouth . Here we go . I want you to do something now . Just grab my hand , when it hurts , I want you to squeeze as hard as possible , okay ? Is that all you got ? You try a little bit harder than that . That 's good . Does this mean I can 't go to the carnival , mommy ? I think you 're gonna be fine for the carnival . I think you 're gonna be okay . That 's good . I 'm starting to feel that a bit now . I 'm just gonna get a bottle of water and a towel . You 'll be okay . I see carnivals in your future . Come here . - I wanna go . - I know . It 's okay , sweetie . Assistant director Wedeck ? That 's me . Come this way . - She 's ready for you . - Thank you . Madam Vice President . Good to see you , Stan . It 's been quite a while . - Please sit . - Thank you . Thanks for coming on such short notice , Stan . How is everything ? You want to tell me why you dragged me out here ? It 's nice to know my new position hasn 't changed your attitude towards me . Does the name Jericho ring a bell ? They 're a private contractor operating over in Afghanistan . I 've heard of them . Agent Benford look into them a while back . Well , in my security briefing this morning , I learned that Jericho 's CEO just tripled the security around his malibu compound . You should take a look . Wrong department . NSA is who you want to call . I don 't want them to know . I need this done off the books . The Vice President doesn 't fly across the country 'cause some guy hired an extra night watchman . In my vision , it was clear that Jericho had done some things that threatened our national security . The same one where you saw yourself as President ? As a matter of fact , yes . And I was there because Jericho did something that triggered a political crises . I can 't find out anything about what they 're doing . But if it 's bad enough to bring down President Segovia , it must be significant . I 've been keeping a close eye on every move they make , and something is happening right now . Are you sure you don 't know what it is even if I did , Dave and I go back 25 years . Listen , these flash-forwards are coming true . Segovia is going down . Do you want to be out with the old or in with the new ? Now we know your gun 's here in L.A. Yeah , too bad Marcie couldn 't tell us who 's using it . So I 'll run this car info , see if anything pings on a 1970s blue sedan . We 're gonna get this guy . Got a second ? Jericho ... You used our database to look into them a few months ago . - Is that a problem ? - No . Just curious why you did . It was a favor for a friend ... Wanted as much information as I could give him , which wasn 't a lot . A friend ? Do all your friends ask you to research third world military contractors ? He had questions about his daughter 's death . She was serving in Afghanistan . He thinks Jericho is involved ? The things he told me ... They were in confidence . I can respect that . Thanks . Do you mind if I talk with him ? Maybe ask him a few questions ? What 's his name ? Aaron Stark . Good luck finding him . He 's off the grid . I don 't know where he is or how to track him down . - Thank you , Mark . - Sure . Just heard on the scanner ... L.A.P.D. ' s in the middle of a high-speed chase . Driver ... Ross Webber ... Has been spotted with a gun . Car they 're following ... '71 blue sedan . The shooter from the homeless shelter ? How many criminals are driving the same disco era sedans , right ? Any idea where they 're headed ? There 's your blue sedan . - Where is he ? - Right inside . A bunch of people ran out . He 's got hostages . - Where is he ? - Second floor . - Who 's talking to him ? - No one yet . - He 's just gonna come out on his own ? - Captain doesn 't want us to do anything . Shots fired ! Get down ! Stay down ! You hang back . I talk to him , try to make sure he releases the hostage . Once he does , you take your shot . Sounds good , except for the part about me staying on the sidelines . No way you 're going down there . I 'm not gonna let that gun kill one more person . March 15th ... I know that 's the day you 're supposed to die . Who says you didn 't get shot three days earlier ? Who is that ? ! I 'm right here ! Try not to shoot me . I told them the only person I want to talk to is Randy Savage ! Macho man ? Yeah , I dig that . That 's not me . - My name 's Demetri . - Oh , god ! You don 't turn around in four seconds , I will kill her . Doesn 't matter to me . She 's just a saleswoman . That 's what she gets for causing the blackout . I said stop ! You still have that gun , right ? I 'm gonna take the clip off now . Here we go . Gone , buddy . And ... On my ankle , I got a gun , man . I 'm gonna take that off , too , okay ? We 're not worrying about that anymore . What were you saying , though , about ... About how salespeople caused the blackout ? That 's a fascinating theory . I 'd like to hear more about it . They made us buy cell phones . Before everybody had a cell phone , nobody ever blacked out . None of ... Stop moving ! You think I won 't kill you ? You 're about just plain incorrect . I 'm not afraid . It 's okay . Everybody 's scared of dying , man . She is . Look at her ... I 'm scared of dying ... All three of us . It 's what makes us human , don 't you think ? You 're scared . That 's fine . See , when people get scared , judgment gets clouded . I 'll be honest , man . You have made some really bad decisions today . But you can make a really good one right now ... If you just give me the gun . Come on . Let me save your life . EMT says he 's stable . We can question him in the hospital . It 's not your gun . Serial number is totally different . Your gun 's still out there . So you almost got yourself killed for nothing ? Yeah , I guess so . All right . You took him down , saved an innocent woman . That 's fantastic work . What I can 't understand is , if you thought that gun was gonna kill you , The place was surrounded . He was never gonna make it out of here anyway . That 's why I needed to get to him , man ... So I could ask him why . Do you remember ... That speech you gave my first day on the job ? It was all about being the kind of person who could be counted on to do the right thing at the right time . Since October 6th , when I didn 't see anything , I have had a lot of trouble being that person . And I need your help . Why ? Look at me . If you think I 've been making good choices , you 're crazier than I thought . I 'll do anything to help you , so I 'm gonna tell you something , and I really want you to listen . Get out of here . You and Zoey just get out of here . - I 'm not running away . - That 's right . You 're not . You 're being smart . Promise me you 'll go somewhere safe . Special Agent Noh , do you recognize exhibit " H " ? Yes . It 's a copy of my notes taken while witnessing the transaction . And those handwritten notes are your only record of the events ? Well , it was a very simple money-for-stolen-goods exchange . That is very good . Agent Noh , who taught you to draw ? I guess I 'm just naturally artistic . Lucky guy , right ? Now your description here of the alleged buyer , here , further down in your notes ... Can you read that for the court , please ? " Caucasian male , average height / weight , " dark jacket , baseball cap . " When my client was booked , he was photographed wearing a red jacket , not a dark one . Wasn 't he ? And he clearly has a goatee , does he not , Agent Noh ? So which individual bought the stolen computer disk , Agent Noh ... The one with the goatee , or the one in your artistic notes ? Because they 're obviously not the same person . - Objection ... Argumentative . - Sustained . - Do I get to answer that ? - Not really . No further questions . I 'm done with this witness . You can go . Come on . There 's no need to take it personally . That was a win that you turned into a loss . It was never really a win , because you were wrong . I 'm gonna go ahead and take the stairs . I 'm sorry . I 'll turn the defense attorney off . That would be an instant improvement . Why don 't you let me make it up to you ? Can I ... Take you to dinner ? - You gotta be kidding me . - What ? There 's not a chance in hell I would ever go out with you . How are you ? Good . Sit down . I want to talk to you . It 's okay . - You 're beautiful . - Shut up . What is wrong with you ? - Nothing . - It 's good . I wasn 't supposed to be there that day . What day ? Al Gough was supposed to be Mark 's partner . I switched with him , and because I was mark 's partner , I was covering the bust that led me to you . All these tiny little decisions we make , without thinking , they all ... They all line up , to lead us somewhere ... Somewhere good . So I want to ask you if you will ... Marry me . Baby , we covered this . I said yeah . No , I want to get married right now . Tomorrow . Then we get on a plane and we go to Hawaii . We stay there through the 15th , maybe through April 29th . Maybe we don 't ever come home . - Want to do it ? - Are you serious ? - I 'm serious . - Hell , yes ! Of course ! I love you . I ... sorry . I just wanted to come by and say thanks for what you did with Charlie today , in the park . No problem . Can I get you to come in ? I just left the water running , but please , please come in . Sure . Sorry . The dishes were getting out of control . Can I get you something to drink ? I could offer you a carton of milk that expired yesterday , some juice boxes or a bottle of gin . No , I think I should be going . Really ? - Thank you for today . - Yeah , I do have a telephone . You could 've called to say thank you . Why are you here ? I don 't know . I 've just made such a mess of things . I wish I could blame it all on Mark , but I really can 't . I made a ton of mistakes . I know that feeling . I tried my best with Linda after Dylan was born , but to be honest , I used his autism as an excuse to get away from her . Even the thought of that makes me ashamed now , I thought I was doing the right thing at the time . You 're damned if you do , - and then you 're damned if you don 't . - Maybe we just ... choose to live in the moment , you know , just grab the ... good things in our life when we recognize them . - I have to go . - Look . Wait . I 'm not trying to argue against Mark . He 's a brave man doing something extraordinary . Yeah , he is . This does kind of put me in the Lancelot-trying - to-persuade-Guinevere position . You did not just compare yourself to Lancelot . The only other metaphor I had involved protons and neutrons , and believe me , under the circumstances , I went with the stronger choice . I know that we 're feeling the same thing right now . How do you know what I 'm feeling ? Because I 'm in that room on April the 29th . That wasn 't an accident . This scares me . It should . Who the hell you ? It 's okay , Aaron . I work with Mark . I 'm a friend . You mind telling me how you found me ? There was a computer in Echo park doing web searches for a " Jericho Parwan Afghanistan , " " Jericho central base " and " Jericho murder US soldiers . " That library 's 2 miles from here . And this is the 14th cash-only hotel I 've hit . Well , here I am . Now what ? Mark didn 't want to tell me why you were so interested in Jericho . But some very powerful people would love to take them down . All they need is proof . They got my daughter . - They kill her ? - They tried . - She 's still alive . - But in your file it ... Tracy 's alive . She was here , but Jericho found her and to her back to Afghanistan . I gotta believe I 've only got so much time left to find her . - Wait . You 're going to Afghanistan ? - Sure am . I know you were in the service , but how are you planning on getting there ? Fly into Uzbekistan , cross the border at Termez . And you 're doing this with a US Passport ? You 'll be dead before you leave Hairaton . I don 't have a choice . Do you know why Jericho tried to kill your daughter two years ago ? She saw Jericho wipe out an entire village . If I could help you get to Tracy ... you think she would tell us the whole story ? Really ? You can do that legally ? - Come here . - What ? Yo , I 'm getting married . - Come here . - I 'm getting married . So would you be okay with Vreede officiating at your wedding ? Define " okay . " No charge . Consider it - my wedding gift . - You 're gonna marry him ? Vreede 's an internet minister . Have I ever told you how awesome you are , Shelly Vreede ? You make me feel awesome . Janis , you 're awesome , too . - Thank you . - Janis is awesome . That 's very sweet . Thank you . All right . Mark is awesome . - Time to take the groom home . - Yeah . Let 's find a cab . Here we go , buddy . - I 'm sleepy . - Yeah . You got military clearance . Your cover is you 're in Afghanistan to help install their power grid . Satellite phone . Video capability . As soon as you can document what Tracy knows , I want it uploaded . If you see any Jericho activity , I want it uploaded ... Pictures , video , audio , anything you can get me . - No problem . - Get yourself to bagram as soon as you 're clear . Military transports leave every two days . - I 'll arrange a flight home . - Excellent . I 'm guessing ... You don 't need me to tell you what to do with these . I got a couple ideas . All this gear is clean . None of it can be traced back to this agency . If they find you ... You 're on your own . Is that it ? I guess it is . Thank you , Stan . This isn 't something I think I need to tell you , but there 's a good chance you 're never coming back . I saw myself with my daughter . We were together in Afghanistan , and she was alive . God help anyone who stands in my way . Do you think I 'm chicken for running away ? Sometimes the best offense is a good defense . I 'm just scared . You played this out as best as you could everybody needs a successful exit strategy . This is yours . I want you to know ... - that night in Somalia ... - Don 't . No , I want to . I have to ... - Just stop . - No , this may be my last chance , all right ? I 'm pregnant . What ? This is perfect . My mom is gonna be so excited . I 'm happy to let you use the space , but since you aren 't members here , and , since we didn 't do any premarital counseling ... We don 't need any premarital counseling . We 've been living together for a year . I 'm going to pretend I didn 't hear . You need to get married this afternoon ... fine . But under these circumstances , you 're going to need to find somebody else to officiate for you . I never heard . Did you , track down Aaron ? I guess he didn 't want to be found . You gotta see this . It 's Frost . You found him ? His phone was activated 12 days ago at a convenience store on the corner of Western and Washington ... 3 : 18 P.M. 3 : 19 , a man fitting Frost 's description walks to a 1971 Citroen DS sedan ... powder blue , silver top . A match from the shelter . Wait a minute . Dyson Frost made a videotape for you 19 years ago , then encoded a phone number for you to find . And then after all that , instead of meeting with you , he 's murdering a homeless guy ? But he used my gun to do it . He may be crazy , but he isn 't random . There 's a method here . We just don 't understand what it is yet . Any word from the LAPD on the search - for Frost 's vehicle ? - Still looking . I 'll stay on top of it . - Let 's keep putting the pressure on . - Guys , can we stop with the shoptalk ? - This is a special occasion . - It 's just like Demetri to be late for his own wedding . He 's not answering his cell . I called three times . Let me try . - Demetri Noh . Leave a message . - Nothing . What is it ? Guys , where is he ? Sweetie . - Hi , mom ! - Step right up , ladies and gents . Wheel of fortune ... One spin for three tickets . You want to give me ? Round and round she goes , and where she stops , nobody knows . Hey . Where are you ? School , carnival . I 'm calling because I 'm gonna make it . I need you to keep Charlie . How come ? Something 's happened to Demetri . What ? Not sure what it is yet . He didn 't show up at the wedding . I thought you should know . - What do you think happened ? - I don 't know . I hope it 's just cold feet , because it 's almost march 15th , and this is too close for comfort . Be careful . Of course . Kiss Charlie for me . I will . Hang on , kids . Hello , Charlie . - = Blackout Team = -

LAUGHTER My sensors indicate Master Luke is asleep , mistress . I know that , K9 . I 'm scanning the alien 's face , Luke 's Nightmare Man is a Vishclar from the Saretti dimension . That creature stopped Luke telling us about him but Luke 's clever . He didn 't record that video because he was scared but because he knew we 'd find it , and he knew we 'd save him ! You still serving burgers ? I always knew you were a stupid boy . Sarah Jane ? We 've got to find a way to talk to him . Remember that sentient concrete disguised as the Chiswick flyover ? She was using this to control people . If we can ... What is it , Mistress ? Clyde and Rani . Oh ! Clyde ! Rani ! Clyde ? Rani ? Rani ? Rani ! Clyde , come on , please ! Clyde ! Rani ! What are you ? Breaking news , Rani . I need you . Er , what do you mean ? I shouldn 't be here ! I don 't know what I 'm doing . You are a journalist , aren 't you ? Go easy on the sauce .

Sarah Jane ? ! You and me , Rani . We 're going to tell everyone who she is . We 're going to destroy Sarah Jane Smith . I can 't wake them up . The sentient concrete , we must wake Luke first . Correct , Mr Smith . Could you use this , K9 , to talk to Luke ? Affirmative . Working . Master Luke , can you hear me ? Master Luke ? I regret I have insufficient power . Perhaps I can help . If I were to connect to K9 , I could boost his energy levels . Oh , what do you need , Mr Smith ? I 've stuff from planets across the universe . Mind control devices , alien plants . Just tell me what you need . I need a USB lead , Sarah Jane . ECHOEY , MANIACAL LAUGHTER It isn 't real . It isn 't real . This is just a stupid dream ! Nightmare Man ! HE LAUGHS EVILLY Nightmare Man ! Can you hear me ? Your mind is so strong , Luke , echoing across the dimensions . Come back and face me ! Mmm ... . no . What 's the matter ? Are you scared ?

Why do you want to destroy Sarah Jane ? Why do you think ? The woman 's a menace to society . What are you on about ? She saves the world ! At what cost , Rani ? You , Clyde , her own son . How many times has she put you at risk ? It 's not like that . Answer ! How many times have you nearly died because of her ? I don 't know . You 're just a child , Rani . It 's not your fault . If we don 't expose her , she 'll get you killed . She has given me a better life . She 's my friend . Oh , grow up ! If you 're going to be a journalist you 'll need to stop worrying about peoples ' feelings . Don 't you want to be a journalist ? Yes . Then there 's nothing wrong with us telling the world . The public have a right to know , Rani . And it 's your responsibility as a journalist to tell them . And on air in five , four ... I don 't want this . I was doing my art . I was good at it , wasn 't I ? Oh , you are sweet . Stupid , but sweet . I 'm not stupid . You were never as good as my Luke . That 's why you ended up here . You 'd never say that .

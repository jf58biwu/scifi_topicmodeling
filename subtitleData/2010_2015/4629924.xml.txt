 THE BOMBING - A HATECRIME AGAINST HUBOTS He 's here . - Should I ? - Yes , answer it . - Hello . - Hi , mom . Malte . Hi . Everything all right ? Yes . Oh , yes . Everything 's just fine . Is somebody there ? No , no . There 's nobody here . Nobody 's here . - That 's the truth , mom ? You wouldn 't lie ? - Why would I lie ? Malte ? Malte ? Malte ? Malte ... Let 's search the house . Just take it easy , nothing will happen to Malte . REAL HUMANS Anita , I 'll get that . Thank you . Engman 's . Yes , sure . She 's here . The taxi company . It 's Inger Engman . Oh ... That 's great . Yes . Thanks for telling me . What ? They found my phone and wallet in the cab . And you look like you 've lost it again . I checked the cab , Hans . It wasn 't there . Is it the worst thing , that you haven 't been robbed ? No , the worst is that not even you believes me . How many times have you come home , claiming this and that , missing or stolen . - Always ending with me finding it . - Okay . But not this time ! - It was dark , you were tired . - My God , can 't you just believe me ? No , I can 't . I think you 're mistaking . It 's ... It 's human . It happens , honey . - Just be happy they found it . - But I 'm so certain . Hey ... you need to unwind . - Why did you sleep down here last night ? - I 've been watching Anita . Well ... I 'm scared , Hans . I 'll go out for a bit . - He 's just scared . - I 'm not allowed to go outside ? Leave us alone for a while . Who are you ? What do you want from me ? To be allowed to live among humans . Not as slaves or machines , but as free transhumans , that 's our goal . My dream . We want to be real too . Just like you we don 't want hubots sold as slaves , stealing your jobs . Tell me . What ? What do you dream about ? - Don 't you have any dreams ? - I don 't know . Tell me . - That I will be like it was before . - A dream that can 't be realized , Roger . - Bea , I want this to end . - Nothing ends . Time cannot stop , everything continues . And those that resist , will perish . You created us , and now we 'll create the world together . What was , is ashes , dead and gone . The only thing there is , is what 's coming . And one day , you will cease to exist . And no one will remember you . Your body will return to the cycle . All thoughts from your life , all emotions , all you 've loved , will be lost forever . The only way to avoid the total annihilation , is to become one of us . I promise you that you will live forever . And I will love you , eternally . Hold me . There , there ... Unplug , Rick . Unplug and come to bed with me . I won 't turn you off anymore . Rick ... - What have you done ? - Cut myself . A bit . But why would you do this ? I don 't know . Come . Come on , Rick . Have I said that I don 't love you ? Have I ? You 're the most important person in my life . Okay ... You said you knew how to turn her into this , other ... Mimi . - Didn 't think we were supposed to ... - Well ... now I think we are . Your hubot . My Mimi must be protected from everyone . Even if I die , Mimi has to be protected . Okay . Give me pen and paper . Give this to Mimi and ask her to memorize it before she destroys it . Hello , Mimi . Where am I ? No , Mimi , it 's okay . My name is Inger . I 've met Leo . I don 't have time to go over it all now , but he gave me this note . He wants you to memorize this . - May I ask what it is ? - Program code . - For ? - I don 't know . Where is Leo ? - That 's a long ... - Please , where is he ? Maybe we should ... I think it 's safest if you were our Anita for awhile longer . I don 't want to be Anita . We will make a move on her workplace . Formally , we hired the law firm , not her . When it comes to Inger Engman , we better go by the book . And as soon as I get a warrant , I 'll be bringing in their hubot . I heard about this morning . Cut open with a knife , in the basement , during a police action . What happened ? Do you have the composites of the units from the vicarage ? Where you and your colleague actually had a look around . Thank you . The woman who decided to cooperate , said the likeness is excellent . A strong 8 . Just want to admire them , or what ? This is all I could find . My ex took most of it when she moved out . This is what she didn 't care to take . Some of Kevin 's stuff in there too . What do you think ? - Looks normal , doesn 't it ? - Yes . It 's just some boy . Looks like he 's leaving . Kev ! Roger , no ! Kev . Hey . Come . Look ... come . - What are you doing here ? - Thought I could stay here , if not ... Yes , of course . It 's just been upside down here lately . Who was that ? It 's nothing ... Damn good to see you . I was just a little surprised . Hello . Hello . - Let 's go to your room . David made sure we knew that we were free . No longer hubots . Free ? - Just like I 've been saying . - Now I want to hear it from Anita . I 'm sorry ... Mimi . Could you explain the difference , - between you and any other hubot that someone 's been illegally tampering with ? - What makes you so special ? - What makes you so special ? Well ... My mother gave birth to me . I have a history , I have emotions . I 'm aware of my existance , and that I will die one day . I ask for ketchup , instead of lingonberry jam for the meatballs . I 'm embarrassed about my knees . There ... My name is Mimi . I was born of David . I don 't know who I want to be in this world , it 's new to me . There are so many paths and I have tried so few . But as long as I feel that I can stand up and leave here , anytime I please I can stay . You still have a high fever . And your CRP is very high . It should have gone down from the treatment , but it hasn 't . - What does that mean ? - You should have died by sepsis by now . If it continues to rise , your tissue will start to decay . - Like a living dead . - Yes , you could say that . Karl ! Can I talk to you ? I 'm not up for this anymore . It 's undignified . You can 't hide him . In a democracy you let people know what 's going on . I will take it under consideration , and get back to you as soon as I can . I really think you have a valid point . Leo , I 'm gonna help you . You 're getting out of here , I promise . That 's all ? Here , yes . I don 't know what she carries or has at home . Some guys will check her computer , they need access to your servers . This is not okay . You signed the papers yourself . Agreed ? Thanks for the help . - Inger ? - Yes ? Sorry to bother you , you have a phone call . Coming ! Here she is , just a moment . - I will talk to you later . - I get to know something ? It 's Inger . They were here and took everything . And they will check your computer . What ? You didn 't give them anything , did you ? I had to . Forced to . If the case closed before a legal trial , they 're granted access to all information - concerning the case , at the law firm or on media owned by the firm . That 's us . I 'm coming over to talk . They 're not getting away with this . No . This is finished . It never existed , you hear me ? This is ... nothing I want to pursue . Inger ? They 've covered it all up . I 'm cut off . My computer seized . Are we going ? Yes , I 'll be right there . Wait in the car . I 'm going to a psychologist with our son , because he 's in love with our hubot . And he 's in a crisis , but when I return I would like to know what 's going on here . We 're not bad people . We just do our job . We want to help you and the entire population from chaos . The code ... There 's a source code that your father developed . By which you and your group are contaminated with , and in possession of . We want that code . So we can take it to the right people . That 's all ... I just ask for your cooperation . We 're prepared to do a great deal for you , if you help us . Where is it ? Who has it ? How can we get it ? What you wrote to your attorney , and you asked to be stored in her hubot . Was it a part of that code ? Maybe you prefer to write in private . I will be back tonight . You have created life , David ! The first non-biological life form . Do you realize what the hubot industry would pay for that ? I 'm doing it for my sake and for the sake of my children . Children . What children ? What are you talking about ? Them ? Even if they are alive , they 're not human . Your son is dead , David . I attended his funeral . You ... No , no . Leave . I said , leave . Get out . What have you done ? Now , leave . - What have you done ? - I said , get out of here . - I will be back . Be sure of that . - Go ! Get lost ... - He will return , not alone , but in force . - Dad 's worried . He needs his pills . In this , all of your digital clones are stored . Including yours . And in this , lies the only copy of the code . Your soul . I want you to take care of it . - Yes ... - Thank you . But I have deleted the last sequence , and without it , it 's useless . And that 's yours , Leo . Store it in your biological memory and don 't mention it for anyone . Remember never trust the humans . Now I want you two you will do something good of this . Together . - Where 's Gordon ? Has he changed ? - Gave him clothes and told him to charge . You need to tell him to charge ? Nice . Soon , all that 's missing are the sweat rings . And the fat rolls . Marylyn , the cord . Oh ... We do that in the bathroom . - What has he told him ? That we 're human ? Yes . Hi ... This is Kevin . My boy . He 's here , visiting . Hello , Kevin . Hello . Kevin used to live here . So you know ... Do you want some coffee ? No . We 'll go in there and talk . This won 't work . The boy can 't stay much longer . Take care of it , or should I ? I 'll do it . - We have to store the harddrive safer . - Where ? We can 't get a bank deposit box , it 's nothing you bury in the ground and it 's not safe to carry around . You haven 't copied it ? No . In the wrong hands , if spread , it could be rendered useless . You understand this ? Who would understand better than me ? And you know there 's no absolute safety . Then it 's time to act . We can 't wait . Say what you want , we need to find Leo now . - Leo is locked up and monitored . - Where ? - I don 't know . I know someone who does . - Good . They just rent , so I can afford it ... - But who are they ? - Guest workers . - From ? - I don 't know . Anyway , here 's your stuff from when you lived here . I vacuumed , that 's it . - You know that guy is a hubot ? - No . - Kevin ... - Fucking pacman music . - You don 't say that at school ? - What of it ? Some teacher may think it sounds bad . I don 't know ... Pacman is a old video game , something wrong with that ? No , no , no . But you know what it means today . I think it 's wise not to talk like that in school or at home . Okay ? Good . Bea ... Beatrice , whom you met . She 's my girlfriend . Sort of . Is it Tobias ? Welcome . When I try to tell myself that she 's a machine , it doesn 't help . It gets worse . And if mom and dad sold her . It would feel like my life was over . - What 's it like with other girls ? - You mean regular ? Ever been in love or together with someone ? I have tried , but ... It doesn 't work . What is it that doesn 't work ? Well , I guess it works for them . But nothing happens to me . Okay . Maybe I 'll get together with someone and just pretend . Isn 't that what people do ? How are you ? I thought we 'd grab a bite . Just you and me . Not hungry ? She was pretty good . The psychologist . Oh . Awesome . That 's great . There 's a hamburger joint across from here and a pizzeria down the road . Me , I 'm starving . - Tobbe ! Hey . - I 'll get home on my own . Buddy ! Hey , wait up . Hey ... Tobbe ? Come on . Does mom know you 're here ? No . Better call her and I need to talk to her too . - She 'll just tell me to come home . - Kevin , she may think this is my idea . - Then you call her . - She 'll hang up when she sees it 's me . Call now . I 'm T.H.S. Transhuman sexual . - That you ... - Are turned on by hubots . It 's a disposition . Like being left , or right-handed . - I don 't know if you knew that . - Yes , yes , yes . I 've read about them . I 'm a transhuman sexual . I 'm one of them . - Big word , isn 't it .. ? - T.H.S. - I can be one of those passing things . - Can 't you just like me any way I am ? Tobbe . - You know I do . - It doesn 't mean I like you any less . Buddy ... And we love you . Just as much . - You understand that ? - Mmm . - Give it to me . - It 's Kevin . Damnit , kid ! What is this ? I was worried out of my mind . - Hey , it 's me . - Where 's Kevin ? - He 's here . - Are you behind this ? No , listen . He came here on his own . - I don 't believe a word of that . - It 's true . Let 's calm down . - Look who 's talking . - I can take him home now , if you 'd like . - Look ... Can I talk to Kev ? - Hang on . Here . She wants to talk to you . Yeah ? Hey . Look , is it like he says , that you just came over there ? He didn 't talk you into it ? And answer truthfully ! - Yes ... - Are you mad at me ? I was thinking about myself a little , I 'm just human , Kev . - I can talk to him . - Leave me alone ! I 'm sorry . - But I love you ... - I know ... It 's just that I don 't want to live with your hubot . And I miss dad . You know , Kev stay with Roger for a few days and I will fix it back home . Okay . You won 't have to see Rick anymore . - I promise . - Thanks , mom . Love you too . You want to play with me ? Then talk to my daddy first . I need to sell him . I need the money too . But I can 't sell him legally . I know ... - I never understood how Kevin felt ... - I have some connections you can call . To get rid of him ... And get payed . - You do ? - How much in a hurry are you ? Now that I 've decided , it can happen as fast as you 'd like . - What will you tell Bo ? - I don 't know . - If only there was another way . - Therese ... Take it easy . Look , he 's a pain ... I 'll tell Bo , that Rick broke . Here 's a number you can call . Ove Holm , EHURB . - Hello , it 's me . - Yes ... I have important information to give you . There 's food for you too . Meet me where I said . Between two old colleagues . See you soon , honey . Sure . Bye . You 're up . I need you . We don 't have much time . Gordon , look at me . Niska and Bea are off to get Leo . We need to find the code . You will help me . Start by getting up . This is about all of us . It 's about you and it 's about Flash . For Flash , Gordon ... Get up . Well , I don 't know ... They 're coming . Model ? Yes , but the model number . X-3 . Okay . - Stolen ? - No , just modified . I 'll look at it . And you have to annul the registration . Do not report it stolen . Yes , an annulment . That it 's busted . I don 't know . That it burned up , was lost at sea , I don 't know . No , they won 't dig in it , you just need a witness to sign off on it . - Good . Then I bid you welcome . - Okay , bye . - I did the dishes and stowed it . - Okay ... - We will run an errand , you and I. - Now ? All the shops are closed . Not all . - Rent a movie ? - Yes . Sort of . - What was that ? Who did this ? - The last customer . What the ... What the hell is that ? We dug this up . Your obituary notice . - You were 11 and supposedly cremated . - Where is my attorney ? You are dead . You 're ashes , Leo . Your urn is at south cemetery , so I don 't think you need an attorney . And you 're not prosecuted anymore . You 're detained under military exemption provisions , regarding national security . You don 't exist . I offered you a way out , but you declined . Both for you and Mimi . Whom we will be bring in . So our technicians can strip her . Piece ... by piece . And concering you ... The content of that urn will be replaced to its proper content . Yes . As soon as we get Engman 's hubot unit . - I must have some say in this ... - I 've said she must be taken out of here . - She must be turned in . - I can take her abroad . - Can mom and I talk in private ? - But it 's a perfect idea . - Tobbe . Check on Sofia . - She 's asleep . This concerns the whole family , I think they all should hear this . I feel like a hostage here . - What is this about ? - It 's about being human . God , it 's so simple . David Eischer 's children are all our children . Our responsibility . They 're not machines , they 're alive . And I think we can learn something from them . Something important . And I will do anything I can to save them . - What are you scared of ? - What I 'm scared of ? I 'm scared for us . I can 't turn her in , go to work in the morning and forget about it . You can 't ? No , I can 't . Then we can 't go on . Okay . Can dad and I get a little privacy ? What movie should we rent ? You can decide that . Hello . - Okay , so that 's the one ? - Yes . Ask it to lie down . Could you lie down over there , Rick ? Do as I say . Please , lie down . It 'll be all right . Lie down here and you 'll see something really funny . - What 's funny ? - Just look up at the ceiling . - Therese . What is this ? - Do as he says . It 's fun . - Where ? - Straight up at the ceiling . - You see it ? - Yes ... - I see it . - What do you see ? Tell me what you see . I see ... It 's a ... You 're leaving me ? We 're not in agreement ... I can 't take this any longer . - She 's a living being , Hans . - No , she is ... We are living beings , you , me , our children . We 're alive . - She . Mimi , Anita . She 's just a machine . - She 's part of the family . She 's not part of my family . Then you take your stuff , pack and move out . Mimi ? Mimi ! ? Mimi ! ? Yes ? Stand there . Don 't turn off the phone . Slowly , put it down in front of you . Take off your jacket and put it on the ground . Turn , one revolution , slowly . You have nothing to fear . And your family is safe as long as you do as we say . - You had information ? - The information is that you will lose . And you better choose the right side . In return we offer you and your family safety . In every way . Where is Leo ? And how can we get to him ? The code is 7986 . - Keys to the garage and the internal mail . - Why would we want them ? - Of course we want the keys . - Yes , of course . How stupid of me . Goodbye , Niska . Look after your keys .

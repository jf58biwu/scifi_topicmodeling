[ woman screaming ] God damn it ! Can you let us out of here ? - All units be advised , base is in lockdown . - [ exhales ] Oh ! Ugh ! [ groans ] [ sighs ] [ distorted noises , alarm blaring ] [ dramatic orchestral music ] II [ helicopter blades whirring ] - Your primary targets are extremely hostile . Your orders are to eliminate on sight with extreme prejudice . These targets will be in prisoner quarantine on level 4 . Secondary is the extraction of the lead science team . Report your elimination of targets by their numbers . Echo 1 , you take the lead . Breach and secure the entrance . Echo 2 , enter via the service tunnels and secure level 3 . Echo 3 , locate and evac science team . Echo 4 , clear prisoner quarantine . - Nice ! It 's a fuckin ' shame . - Once we infiltrate the facility , base security will be on high alert . But give them no quarter . Make no mistake . Today they 'll give you none in return . - Takin ' care of business .

You 're in a facility 200 feet underground . And I 'm here to get you out . But you have to throw a little bit of trust my way , okay ? - Trust you ? - Echo team , proceed . - Chief ! - Hold your fire ! - That 's her . That 's Tango 8 . - I gave you a direct order , soldier . - Yeah , but they 're not Echo Daddy 's orders . - No , they 're mine .

This is Echo Daddy . Report . Echo 3 , report . This is Echo Daddy . - What 's going on with you , Chief ? - We have a history . - We 're risking a court-martial 'cause you 're fucking the target ? - It 's a little more complicated than that . - Why ? You fucking the other targets as well ? Oh ! - You are way out of line . - At least I 'm not acting like I drew it myself . - Fuck this ! Commands orders are to put this bitch down . What do you think is gonna happen when the two of you waltz out of here hand in hand ? They 're gonna fuckin ' kill her . - Hey ! Come on ! Come on ! You and me , baby . Come on ! - Everybody stand down ! - You and me ! Come on . - You too , soldier . - Soldier ? - You handle a weapon like one . You really don 't remember anything ? ' Eve ? - Well , Eve ... Pointing a gun at my team is just gonna provoke them . - [ chuckles ] You got that right . - She 's my wife . - Yeah , of course she is . And Wiki 's my pet cooker spaniel . Come on . - But she can 't be . My wife drowned . - You should have stood down , Chief . You put us all in danger . Knowing the target compromises the mission . - She came up in the mission brief . I had to get to her first . I had to be sure . - Am I the only one missing something here ? The army simply forgot that they were sending you into this shithole to kill your missus ? We go way back , and I don 't remember any wedding bells . - [ sobbing ] - I 'm sorry , Wik . I know how hard it is to lose someone . - Fuck you ! Are you sure it 's her ? - Absolutely . I can 't explain it ... But it 's her . - How are we gonna get her out of here ? - I 'm working on it . Let 's just get topside to the extraction point . We 'll slip away from there and take our chances . I 'm not asking you to follow us . But I 'm not asking for permission either . Whatever we 're dealing with down here , we 'll do better if we stick together . - All right . Which way ? Nav map 's gone . - Up . Elevators and doors will be security coded . She 's coming with us . [ water trickling ] - Clear . - Why would Command send us into a shit storm without an umbrella , Chief ? - Need to know basis , Fourpack . - Kind of sounds like something we might need to know . - So does a pregnancy , Corporal . - What about you , sweetheart ? You don 't talk much , do you ? Yeah , Wiki . - So we were married ? - We were stationed overseas together . Our cover was newlyweds . - It was France . - Yes . - I can see just ... images , flashes of things . - What else ? - Nothing . - Our mission was compromised ... the day we were gonna go away together , where no one could find us . I slipped away to get something . When I came back , you were gone . - And you blame yourself ? - Every single day . But now you 're here . - But how can I be ? - I don 't know . But I intend to find out . Move . I 'll go and make sure it 's clear . They won 't hurt you . - Save me ... [ echoing ] Save me . - Ah ! [ machine gun fire ] [ woman screaming ] - Hold your fire ! Christ ! What the fuck ? - What happened ? - Oh , Jesus . Christ , man , what the fuck ? - Captain . - What happened ? I just saw something . - I 'll tell you what happened . You trigger-happy troglodytes nearly killed me . - Take it easy . It was an accident . - An accident ? Stubbing your toe is an accident . This is a fucking disaster . - Calm yourself down . - She 's a civilian , Chief . - Then it 's bloody murder , isn 't it ? - Matthews , I think you should listen to the gentleman with the gun . - Jesus Christ . What did you do to her ? What the hell have you Frankenfucks been up to down here ? - Corporal ! - We just lost a man to one of their science experiments , and I want to know what we 're up against . And I reckon you 're just the man to tell us . - When you 're about to kill a man , it costs nothing to be polite . - You don 't seem as distressed as your colleague . - He was very attached to his work . - And what line of work is that ? - Safeguarded work . Beyond your pay grade . No offense . - Wik , let him go . Fourpack , shoot that one . - No , no , no , no , no . Wait , wait , wait . Wait . No , no . - What are we dealing with ? - Visual and auditory hallucinations triggered by derangement of the synapses and neural enhancements . - I 'm two cans short of a six-pack , so let 's try that again in English , dickhead . - Biomechanics , the application of mechanical principles to biological systems . - All right . - Matthews ... - Let him finish . - We 'd just finished a radical brain-grafting procedure . [ soft clanking ] A procedure on her . That 's when everything went crazy . An orderly started screaming , and then she killed one of the nurses . When the base went into lockdown , we cut our way up here into the ducting to escape . But she 's the cause . You need to get rid of her . - That 's enough . - Okay , no , you need to get rid of her . - That 's enough ! - I say we waste them all , get the fuck out of here , and call it a day . - You and your men are in over your heads , Captain . Now , people drown that way . - In my line of work , that 's how we learn to swim . My pay grade doesn 't include babysitting either . But I have my orders . So you and your little convoy are under my wing . You do exactly what I say when I say it . Understand ? - Perfectly . - All right , listen . Up is out , and that 's where we 're going . Fourpack , you take point . Wik , cover our 6 . - Got it . - Let 's go . - Move . - Come on , move ! - So tell me , Doc - - Darius . Darius Caesar . - How does a woman I know to be dead end up in a military base under the middle of nowhere ? - Eve is a very special girl . Although , how she came to us is beyond my knowledge . I 'm sorry I can 't give you the answers you 're looking for . - Well , you must have pissed in somebody 's pockets to attract the attention of the brass upstairs . - You strike me as a man who understands the nature of clandestine work . What we do here isn 't exactly sanctioned by the government . - Which government ? [ distant gunfire ] Fuck . That was on this level . Move . - Move it . Move it . - Ah ! - For God 's sake , get up ! Get up ! Go ! [ metal banging ] [ men yelling in distance ] - Ah ! - Move ! Get down ! - Is this really a smart idea , crawling headfirst into mayhem ? - That 's the way we enter the world . May as well go out the same way . - I was a breach birth . I think I should head back this way . - Move ! - Okay - Weasel . [ gunshots ] [ gunshots ] - Cease fire ! Cease fire ! This is Echo 3 . Identify yourself . - What do you want ? You 're all against me ! [ gunshots ] [ gunshot ] - It 's Echo 2 and an unknown . - What 's going on ? Are they shooting at us ? - Echo 2 , this is friendly Echo 3 . Lower your weapon ! [ gunshot ] Identify yourself ! Wik , move up ! Cover us here . - Like a rug , Chief . - Identify yourself ! Identify yourself ! Show me your hands ! Show me ... Show me your hands . - [ Whispering ] Kill them ... - Chief . Chief . [ gunshots ] - Ah ! What happened ? - You tell me . - What 's going on ? Are we clear ? - You keep this to yourself . - Keep what to myself ? I have no idea what just happened . - Are we clear ? - We 're clear . - Move . Move ! - Good luck , Matthews . - Damn it . One 's missing . - Good . Leave the little rat to this maze . - What the hell happened here , Chief ? - Oh , my God . - It 's close-range fire . They did it to each other . - Yeah , but that doesn 't make any sense . - No , it doesn 't . You 've got some explaining to do . - I don 't exactly know what to tell you . - That 's not good enough , Doc . I 've been very reasonable . But fuck it . I 've already shot one civilian today . - No , no , no , wait . Okay , wait . Wait , wait ! Wait . What if I told you that ... every Western world leader is protected around the clock by a psychic blocker , just like Emily here ? - Protected from what ? - Outside influences . Remote viewers - or enablers , as we 've come to call them . - Remote what-sis ' ? - The ability to gather information from a distant or unseen target using paranormal means . - In the ' 80s , the Soviets developed a paranormal division to turn telepathic curiosities like Emily and Eve here into weapons of espionage . Now , we had to take this threat seriously , thus Project Genesis began . - Genesis ? - Our own program , testing the validity of psychic combat . - Oh , that 's great . So we 've been sent down here to pop a bunch of palm readers ? - Now , make no mistake . This facility is under psychic attack . ' BY Who ' ? That guy ? - Prisoners just like him . When you breached this facility , the security safeguards went down momentarily . The cells in the quarantine area were opened . These were our first test subjects . They 've proven to be very difficult to control . - Yeah , no shit . - This is bigger than you or your men , Captain . There is an invisible battlefield out there , psychic soldiers able to turn our enemies against themselves , a whole frontline replacement . - Jesus Christ . You 're insane . - What did you do to me ? - Well , one man 's genius can be seen as another man 's insanity . - What did you do to me ? - It is not what I did to you . It is what I did for you . - A shitty haircut and a bad stitch job ? - When you came to this facility , you were suffering from chronic neurological seizures . You were dying . I had to remove the offending part of your brain and replace it with a donor 's . The interspecies grafting procedure you have undergone has not only saved your life ; it has made you unique , one of a kind . The next lnterspecies ? What the hell have you put in my head ? What the hell ? Why , why ? Why did you do this to me ? - You volunteered ! - Oh . You 're gonna reverse whatever the fuck you 've done to me . You 're gonna reverse it . Please . - You 'd die if I tried . Besides , the lab was destroyed when they stormed this facility . - Eve , we 'll find a way . But we 've got to get out of here first . - You were sent to kill me . You - No , there 's no other way ! I 'm gonna - - Wiki , no ! - She is bat-shit crazy enough to pull that pin . Whatever it is these pricks have been doing to her down here , it 's made her unstable . - She 's right , Chief . - We can 't trust her . She 'll turn on us . - Or worse . We 'll turn on each other , like these guys here . - You have no idea how valuable she is . She just needs time , time to learn to control her abilities . - Well , time isn 't a thing we 've got a whole lot of . This belongs here . You can find your own way out . - Piece of advice , Captain ... If you find yourself going through hell , just keep going . - Yeah , I 'll send you a postcard . _ [ groaning ] What are you doing ? No . [ groaning continues ] - Saw . This will be over before you know it . [ monitor beeping rapidly ] [ saw whirring ] - [ screams ] - This situation is FUBAR , Chief . I don 't know if these shafts are getting smaller or I 'm getting fatter . Can 't we just get out of here , Chief ? Take the elevator ? - We 're one man down with a civilian in tow . Base security will cut us down like flies . [ dog barking in distance ] - What 's the go with you and blondie locks ? - You ever felt like you 've been given a second chance ? - What do you mean ? - Can you hear that ? - To go back , wash away a moment in time . [ distant roaring ] - I 'm not following you , Chief . - It 's nothing . Forget about it . [ low growling ] - It 's a dog . - We could just leave her here . Out of sight , out of mind . - It 's a fucking dog . - What ? Wiki , talk to me . - It 's staring at me . It 's staring right at me . [ dog growling ] - Wiki . [ machine gun fire ] - Ah ! [ dog barking ] [ screaming ] - Wik ! What the hell are you doing ? - Oh , my God ! Please help me ! Chief ! Help me ! [ screaming ] Shoot the thing ! Shoot it ! - Shoot what ? There 's nothing there , soldier . - [ screaming ] Chief ! Shoot it ! Oh ! Ah ! [ groans ] [ screaming ] God ! " No ! [ electronic whirring ] [ loud explosion ] - [ distorted speech ] [ muffled gunshots ] [ ringing ] - [ muffled ] Fourpack , come on , mate ! They 're on us ! - Ugh . [ gunshots ] Oh ! - Authorization accepted . - Move ! Go , go , go ! - Here they come . - On the left ! On the left ! On the left ! Let 's go ! We need a way out ! Move ! [ radio chatter ] - Activation of fire prevention measures . [ machine gun fire ] - Move it , soldier ! Let 's go ! Go , go ! Keep moving . - [ chuckles ] - Stay with me , big guy . [ gunshots ricocheting ] - Ah , fuck ! - Someone 's playing with us . Ah ! Move ! Go , go , go ! Move , move , move ! Turn back ! [ radio chatter ] [ machine gun fire ] ' [ groans ] Fire in the hole ! - Fuck ! - Yes . - [ breathing heavily ] - Someone 's looking after us . - Why did you save them , Darius ? - I think the valiant captain might still be of some use to us . [ smoke hissing ] - We 're not out of the woods yet . Looks like we got a CO2 problem . [ both coughing ] - Where are you , Eve ? Where are you ? There . [ hatch whirring ] - What is your situation ' ? - Listen , we had a deal . I 've got the information you needed . { need you to get me the fuck out of here . - An extraction team has been dispatched . - Your extraction team almost killed me . - Please hold While I transfer you . - Can you hear me ? Hello ? Fuck ! [ sighs ] Come on . Hurry up . ' [ grunts ] - Stay back . Please . - What are you afraid of ? - You have no idea what you 're capable of . And to me , that makes you much more dangerous than if you did . - Matthews . [ chuckles ] I think you 've just signed your death warrant . - I have this burning feeling that I - that I wouldn 't have willingly given myself over to be an experiment , a medical freak . - Well , part of you did , and part of you didn 't . - I 'm not gonna lie to you , mate . It 's gonna be tight . [ grunting ] - No way . I don 't think I can do that . - Is there a problem , soldier ? - Well , let 's just say I used to be a fat kid . - Would you rather suffocate ? - Honestly , yeah . - Shut up and get your fat arse up the pipe . [ grunting ] - Everything feels wrong . This body , my hair , these thoughts , they 're not my own . - Cell-to-cell communication between donors is not uncommon . It 's like putting two hard drives into the same computer . - Fuck . [ grunting ] - You through , big guy ? - Fuckin ' shafts weren 't exactly designed for the portly gentleman . [ grunting ] - That 's lucky for you ... 'Cause you 're no gentleman . - You 're lucky I can barely move , 'cause I 'd punch you in the face . - [ chuckles ] - Would I still have died if I hadn 't have gone through with the operation ? - Died ? What are you talking about ? - Caesar . He said I was dying . _ Dying ? Far from it . You came to us as one of the most gifted remote viewers we 'd ever seen . Troubled , yeah , but definitely not dying . [ keyboard slacking ] Darius wanted to amplify your abilities , combining two telepaths via direct neurografting . He figured that a soldier , like yourself , who was used to taking orders would be ... easier to control . - Easier to control ? - The other telepath donor was less than willing , so to speak . I was against it from the start , for what it 's worth . - Is that the donor ? - L , um ... I really wouldn 't do that if I were you . [ computer beeps ] You 're not ready for that . - I can feel it . I can feel it just beneath the surface . Oh , no . I want to go back . I just want to go back to the way I was . - That 's gonna be a lot more difficult than you can ever imagine . - Why ? - Because your memories are lying in a Petri dish . [ keyboard slacking ] This is a preliminary interview with Corporal Sandra Bloom before the hearing . Please state your full name and rank for the camera . - Fuck you ... sir . - This is just a legal formality to assess your mental state before your court-martial on charges of deserfion . Pm trying to help you . There 's no need to be hostile . - [ Spits ] - Can you tell me Why you tried to kill yourself ? - Not myself . The others ... inside . - Inside ? Inside your head ? - Too many people . Too many voices . - So you shot yourself to stop the voices ? - I had to let them out . How else are they meant to get out ? They needed a door to get out . - Did H stop the voices ? Did you get them out ' ? Can you hear them now ' ? - loan still hear your voice , even when your lips aren 't moving . - We can stop the voices . And these charges against you , we can make them disappear . Do you understand ' ? Okay , but you have to trust us . You also need to understand that your body and mind become property of this facility until deemed fit for service by Operation Genesis facilitator Dr. Darius Caesar or appropriate ranked officer outlined in said operational brief . - { need a pen . - Of course . ls there a problem , Oorporai ? - [ grunts ] Where do I sign ? - Just here . - [ grunts ] - [ screams ] ' [ grunts ] _ [ grunting ] ' [ grunts ] _ [ grunting ] - Ah ! - Ah ! - [ gagging ] - [ screams ] Ugh ! - Access denied . - Come on ! - Access denied . _ [ grunting ] Ah ! [ saw whirring ] Your trigger-happy boyfriend should have gotten rid of you when he had the chance . I didn 't spend four years underground playing second fiddle to a man with a God complex for nothing . [ laughs ] This is my retirement . - [ growling softly ] - You get out of my fucking head . [ grunting ] Ah ! [ grunting ] Get out of my fucking head . [ saw whirring ] No ! - [ growling softly ] - Stay back !

[ whirring stops ] - Darius , are we going now ? - Shh . - Darius , I won 't be able to block her soon . Her abilities are quickening . - [ panting ] [ unzipping ] [ gasps ] [ screams ] - Emergency . Structural integrity compromised . Containment protocols are active . You now have 15 minutes to evacuate . - Time to go , my dear . - Emergency . Structural integrity compromised . Containment protocols are active . - Containment protocols ? What do you think is gonna happen in 15 minutes ? - We don 't want to be here to find out . ' [ grunts ] - [ breathing heavily ] [ rat squeaking ] _ [ grunting ] - [ breathing faster ] Just keep moving , big guy . - Hey , Chief . We 've been through some crazy shit . That stuff that happened before with Wiki , that was ... I mean , what would make somebody do something like that to themselves ? - Emergency . Structural integrity compromised . Containment protocols are active . - I 've seen some things down here that I can 't explain . [ breathes heavily ] Let 's just concentrate on getting ourselves out of here , okay ? [ breathes heavily ] I 've found an exit ! _ [ grunting ] - We 're almost there , big guy . Just think of the cold beer I 'm gonna buy you when we get out of here . ' [ grunts ] I think I 'm gonna cut back on the beers from now on . [ grunting ] [ distorted children 's laughter ] [ banging ] [ distorted children 's voices ] [ breathes heavily ] Hey , Chief . Hey , you believe in all that fortune-teller shit ? - Just keep moving ! We 're almost there ! Once we get through here , we 'll be home free ! Just keep moving ! - [ breathes raggedly ] - [ panting ] [ gasps ] - Fourpack ! Eve is here ! - Oh , fuck me . [ blood sizzling ] [ gasps and shrieks ] There 's a fire underneath us ! - It 's in your head , mate ! - No , there 's a fire ! There 's a fire underneath us ! - Just keep moving ! - [ shrieking ] - Eve , please , if you can stop this ... He won 't touch you . - [ in deep voice ] No . He wants to kill me . - Fourpack ! - [ panting and shrieking ] - Just tell her you won 't hurt her . - I 'll kill the bitch ! - Eve , please . Please ! - [ shrieking ] - Come on , mate , stick with me . And I mean stick with me ! Eddie ! - [ blubbering and shrieking ] - Eddie ! Just stop thinking about it , Eddie , and it 'll go away - trust me . - [ bellowing ] [ sizzling ] ' Eve ! Please ! - Help me ! Help ! - Eddie ! - [ moaning and howling ] - For the love of God . - I can 't die like this . - Fourpack , come on , man . Come on , stick with me ! Stick with me , man . Eve , please ! Please ! - You tell my kids I love them ! " No ! - You do that ! - Eddie ! [ gunshot ] [ muffled shouting and banging ] [ mournful instrumental music ] II [ shouting ] - You all right ? [ stammering ] Okay . What are you doing ? [ metallic creaking ] - This isn 't easy . . Okay " You 're not the one about to get a bullet in the face . - I should have done it when I first laid eyes on you . - [ breathing slows ] - I 'm sorry . [ pistol clicks ] - [ breathes deeply ] [ in deep voice ] I know your secret . It was you . - No . No . - You did this to me . - It can 't be you . It can 't be . - But I can make it all go away , the guilt , the loneliness . - But it can 't be you . You 're dead . Jesus Christ . - You can save me this time . You can save me this time . [ whispering ] Save me . - Emergency . Structural integrity compromised . Containment protocols are active . - Yeah . I can save you . - I forgive you . - I can . I can save you . - Save me . Save me . - That 's enough . It 's over . - [ growls softly ] - It 's time for us to go , my dear . - [ breathes heavily ] - I am very proud of you . - Proud ? All my men are dead . - Their deaths will prevent millions of others . They performed admirably . - You son of a bitch . [ creaking ] - As an assassin , Captain , you were sent down here to kill people , whereas I am trying to save them . - [ in normal voice ] And me ? - Unsettling as this has been , the attack on this facility was advantageous in field-testing your potential . We need to learn how to use and control your abilities . In time , it will become easier for you . - No . She 's not going anywhere with you . - You willingly signed yourself over for this project . - No . ldidn 't . - Emergency . Structural integrity compromised . Containment protocols are active . - As you can hear , we don 't have time to argue . There 's an exit just down there that leads outside . You must let us finish what we started . [ creaking ] _ [ growling ] - You want to get in here , don 't you ? - Romeo ... [ in deep voice ] Take us out of here . Shoot him . We can be together again . - Memory fabrications . Intensive non-lucid hallucinations in third parties . - Enough with the fucking bio-babble . - No , no , listen ! Listen , Captain ! Eve has implanted herself into an old memory of yours . Before today , the two of you have never met . You have never even crossed paths ! It 's a defense mechanism , erasing any doubt in you that the woman you were sent to kill is a past lover . Consciously or not , Eve is protecting herself , like a chameleon adapting to its surroundings . Only in this case , she 's using your memory as a camouflage . - [ whispers ] He 's lying . - Think hard about your past history with her , Captain . - Emergency . Structural integrity compromised . Containment protocols are active . [ creaking ] - A lost love who you were told betrayed her country and your confidence , your loyalty put to the test . - She was innocent . - A heavy burden to carry for any man . - How could you know this ? - No . No . No , you were going to ask me to marry you . - It 's not only his mind you need to convince ; it 's his heart . She is going to make us so proud .

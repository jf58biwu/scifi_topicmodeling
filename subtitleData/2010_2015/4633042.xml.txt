 1x11 - Off the Rack [ whooshing ] [ engines revving ] [ automatic gunfire ] - These drones are all over us ! - You said this was gonna be easy ! No , I said take it easy . We 're almost home ! These refugees are counting on us . It 'd be easier if we had Julie 's hollow ... whatever . - Image distortion hook . - No thanks . Mike , where 's she at this time , anyways ? I want to thank you , the loyal members of my executive staff , for honoring me with this tremendous statement - of my greatness . - Hey , Mike . Any chance you could make it down here ? We could really use your help on this one . I know . I 'm sorry . Intern thing . Can 't get away . My boss is getting an award . [ applause ] I gotta go . [ clapping ] [ gasp , exhales ] All right , boys . We 're gonna have to run the gauntlet without her . [ screaming ] Hey , Mike . Everybody okay down there ? Mission accomplished . Kane 's got a few less citizens to kick around in Deluxe . Yeah , it was great , until the part where you forgot to show up . Thankfully , I totally bailed us out . Hai-ya ! - I tried , guys . Really . - Hey , we made it . But those new sector enforcer drones are pretty nasty . Gonna be tough to keep this up if we can 't find a way to get rid of ' em . You don 't suppose you need somebody to snoop around , to find out where Kane 's make these things so we can shut it down ? Yeah . If only I knew somebody with that kind of access . I 'm on it . Hey , you know you can count on me . I know . [ klaxon blares ] Hello , Deluxe . Abraham Kane here with exciting news . Say goodbye to that old mandatory unitard and hello to the all-new mandatory safe-t-suit . Jam packed with a dazzling array of safety features , including stability magnets , collar side airbags , safety foam parachute pants ... you name it , it 's in there ! So no matter what those Burners may throw at you , you 'll stay in one piece ... and KaneCo chic . I can believe you 're bailing on me ... again . I 'm sorry , Claire , but I have to do this . I let the guys down . I don 't want them thinking I 'm making a habit of it . You 're life is getting way too complicated . Why don 't you just stay up here where it 's clean and comfy and safe and not at all scary and weird , like Motorcity . You 're right . My life is complicated . But I have something I believe in , and I have to fight for it . Why does it have to be you ? I can 't just sit back and let my father ... If I don 't try to help Motorcity , then I 'm no better than him . So , what does my little girl have planned for the day ? Hey , dad . Oh . Oh . You know , nothing exciting . Gonna go hang out with Claire , do , you know , do girl stuff . Oh , yeah . Totes , Mr. Kane . Jules have been talking non-stop about picking out accessories to go with the new safe-t-suits . Speaking of which ... - [ gasps ] Oh my gosh , oh my gosh ! - Hey ! Oh , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you ! Thanks , dad . Uh , ya didn 't have to . Of course I did . [ laughs ] Well , you girls have fun . And , uh , be sure to report any Burner activity . You got it , Mr. Kane ! - Hey , no need to thank me , or anything . - Thank you . Anyways , I 'm off to live my completely uncomplicated , awesome life . But do me a favor ... don 't do anything crazy out there . [ alarm blares ] [ shrieks ] Warning ! Danger detected ! [ sizzling ] Looks kinda hairy to me . No , man , you 're hairy . This ... this is just plain scary . So dangerous no humans are even allowed inside . If I wasn 't completely terrified , I might be kind of impressed . - Nice job snagging these files , Jules . - Any time . Yeah , must have been pretty hard to get a little file out of one of those ... things that has files in ' em . Almost as hard as it 's gonna be to smash this place . You can come see how it 's done if you 're not too busy up top being Miss Deluxe . Ease off . Jules is one of us . Yeah . But it might not be a terrible idea to have a back-up play in case we 're down a guy . - Or a girl . - Come on , guys . You serious ? No , I get it . You needed me , and I wasn 't there . But I 'm no " Miss Deluxe . " I 'm a Burner ! - And I 'm gonna prove it to you . - You don 't need to prove anything . I 'm taking out the drone factory ... alone . What ? ! That 's crazy ! Hey , wait up ! Jules , you can 't do this by yourself . I can if I 'm wearing this . Whoa ! What is it ? It 's a safe-t-suit . Don 't worry . It 'll protect me . Jules , wait . Come back . Man : And we 're actually ahead of our syntha-soy quotas . Attention . Safe-t-suit deployed in Motorcity . Oh , my god ! One already ? A Burner ! Ho ho ho ! This is going to be fun . Come on , Jules . Entering external control mode . Uh ... Uh ... I 'm not doing this . Oh ! I am glad you changed your mind . Now let 's talk this out . No , no , no ! I am not doing this ! Jules ? [ grunting ] - What 's going on ? - Uh , Jules ? Julie : Whoa ! Whoa ! Oh ! Guys ! What is this thing doing ? ! No ! Help ! No , no , no , no ! Get out of the way ! Whoa ! [ tires screech ] Did Julie just try to kill us ? [ grunting ] Hey ! No ! Uhh ! [ engine revving ] - Mr. Kane , are you driving that car ? - That 's right , Tooley . I added a number of unadvertised features to the new safe-t-suit , features that will keep those defectors from fleeing Deluxe . Sir , the percentage of defecting Deluxians is miniscule . Surely you didn 't introduce a new suit just to stop a handful of disgruntled citizens ? Nyuhh ! A trickle can become a downpour ! We lost Mike Chilton , and look what kind of grief that brought us ! Tooley , why don 't you help our friend here brush up on his math skills ? Sure , Mr. Kane ! That means I get to hit him , right ? Ha ha ha ha ! [ gulps ] Don 't freak out . Don 't freak out . Ohh . Really messed up this time , huh ? Kane : Attention , Burner trash I am currently in control of ! - Dad . - You are in violation of over 38 peace codes and will be delivered to the authorities ... being me ... at once for reckless subversion ! Yes , okay . Now it 's time to freak out . Julie , what the heck is going on ? Uh , nothing too crazy . Kane 's just hijacked my safe-t-suit and now he 's got me headed for KaneCo tower ! He sees me and Mike , my cover 's blown ! This is why you 'd don 't mess with Kane 's gear ! I don 't worry . Chuck 's on it . Uh , you are on it , right ? Ah . The suit 's sending out some kind of signal to Kane . Can 't jam it . It 's got all kinds of crazy encryption . [ motor revving ] [ tires screech ] [ automatic gunfire ] Aaaaah ! Aaah ! Mike : Okay , guys , we gotta get Julie out of this . Tex , get up front and ride the brakes . Okay , fine , but you know I should totally be gut-punching a bot in the face right now ! Texas , give me the Mutt . Dutch , you rough start dropping road blocks to guide us back to Motorcity . Done and done ! And I 'll do my best not to get killed . Texas ! Uhh ! Chilton ! [ yells ] Man , am I glad to see you . Ooh ! Funny way of showing it . - Sorry . - Don 't sweat it . I got it all ... uhh ! ... under control . Ho ho ho ho ! Tooley , I tell you , this is the next best thing to pummeling that traitorous cadet in person ! Pummel him good , Mr. Kane ! So , uh , that whole trying-to-prove - I 'm-a-Burner thing isn 't working out quite the way I planned . Really ? This isn 't what you were going for ? Aaah ! Okay . All right . That one I maybe deserved . All right , bro , let 's cause a little mayhem ! Hey , Mikey , looks like your plan is working ! Great ! Let 's get Julie back to H.Q. so we can get the suit off of her . I 'm running out of snot for her to beat out of me . Very clever . [ chuckles ] My turn . [ beeping ] External ... External ... Control mode ... External control mode . What the ... ? [ automatic gunfire ] Aaaaaah ! Uh , Mr. Kane , are you playing a video game now ? Yes , Tooley . In a way ... I am . Hey ! I can 't see ! External control mode . - Ka-troo ! - Boo-hoo-hoo ! Kane : It 's hot out there , Deluxe . Stay cool with Kaneshades . The latest from Abraham Kane . And don 't forget ... they 're mandatory . Yeah , but do you have anything , ya know , more me ? External control mode . - Aaah ! - We 're under attack by Claire ! Well , now that we 've gotten rid of your Burner pals , let 's finish this face-to-face . Oh , no . [ rapid beeping ] Aaah ! You gonna take care of that , or should I ? - She is not a " that " ! - Yeah , I am not a " that " ! Matter of opinion . Just get your girlfriend off my car . Girlfriend ? Ha ! I 'd rather be a " that . " Don 't worry , Claire ! I got you ! [ tires screech ] Whoa ! One threat detected . Threat level increasing . Approaching maximum threshold . Claire ! [ crying ] You 're alive ! Protection threshold at capacity . Safe-t-suit shutting down . - Your suit turned off ! - It didn 't turn off . You broke it . Claire ! Do you know what this means ? Yeah , that you 're gonna have to get me a new one . We figured out how to disable the safe-t-suits ! I gotta let Mikey know about this ! Wait . What ? ! You 're just gonna leave me here ? ! I 'll be back ! What am I supposed to do now ? Ooh ! I love that color ! [ both grunting ] Whoa ! Anybody ever tell you you fight like a girl ... Sorry . ... that 's being controlled by an evil dictator ? No more jokes . You gotta go . It 's over . It 's not over until I get you out of here ! Ha ha ha ha ha ! Finally ! I 'm the one who got us into this . I can 't let you pay for it ! You have to go ! Motorcity needs you ! You can find someone else to help you steal files and make holograms . I 'm not leaving ! And the Burners need you ! I think I 've proven I 'm the last person the Burners need . - Mike , I need to tell you something . - What is it ? I 'm really ... - I 'm really ... - Chuck : Mikey ! Safety overload ! - Uh , come again ? - Julie 's suit ... you have to overload it ! It 'll shut down if you damage it beyond its protection threshold ! So , how much damage are we talkin ' about ? A lot ! Ridiculous amounts ! Right ! Damage it ! Piece of cake . The enforcer drone factory ! It 'll totally overload the suit ! - Too dangerous . - More dangerous than this ? You got a point . Okay , let 's do it your way . [ engine revving ] What ? ! No ! Are you insane ? ! You 'll be fine . You 've got the safe-t-suit . - Yeah , but what about you ? - I 've got Mutt ! Warning ! Danger detected ! Threat level increasing . [ machinery powering up ] Warning . Threat detected . [ clanking ] [ low buzzing ] Warning . Protection threshold at capacity . - Safe-t-suit shutting down . - Uh-oh . [ beeping ] No ! No ! I had that Burner ! That defector ! Tooley ! Tooley ! Tooley ! Tooley ! Tooley ! Tooley ! What are you doing ? ! Mr. Kane , I 'm making the people dance . Look . Ooh , they 're havin ' a ball ! A ball , indeed . Tooley , go find something useful to do ! Yes , sir , Mr. Kane , sir ! Oh ... heh heh heh heh . Julie : Hey , Mike , so the good news is ... the suit turned off . Bad news , the suit turned off ! Okay , guys , we gotta get there double-time ! Julie 's gonna need our help ! [ strange noise approaching ] Seriously ? Now , that 's something you don 't see anymore ! Or ever ! Human ball ! [ explosions ] [ automatic gunfire ] [ distant screaming ] Protection threshold at capacity ... Safe-t-suit shutting down ... . Protection threshold at capacity ... Safe-t-suit ... Safe-t-suit shutting down . ... shutting down . Aha ! Wow , happy to be out of that thing . Mike : Julie ? Oh ! Good to see you in one piece . Even better to be in one piece . Aha-ha ! Julie , you just kicked some serious drone butt ! Yeah . With nothin ' but her muscles ! I gotta admit , Julie , you ain 't no miss Deluxe ... - you 're a dang Burner , lady ! - I told you we needed you . You gotta teach me some of them sweet moves . Kur-tow ! Ka-boom ! Whoo-ahh ! Whoa ! Easy there , Tex . Tooley : Julie ! Tooley ! Uh , the Burners ... they got me . Wait . I thought you were on our side . She is . Play along . I 'm coming , Julie ! Ohh ! So , what are we gonna do with him ? I 've got an idea . Guys ! It 's about to start ! Hello , fellow Deluxians . As you know , those insidious Burners hacked into the safe-t-suits for their own sick amusement ... but I promise version 2.0 is in the works . With even better features . Okay , Chuck , work your magic . So remember , folks , KaneCo is always here to provide you with ... Hey , Mr. Kane ! Look at me ! The suit is making me dance . Tooley ! - Ha ! Nice one . - Now I do what I can . Claire : Not only did my suit go crazy , - but Chuck hugged me . - Wait a minute . Are you saying you don 't love the KaneCo safe-t-suit ? Yeah , it 's not as great as I thought , but it 's still way better than that gross old-school stuff you guys wear down there . So how much longer you gonna mess around with this double-life stuff ? Can 't keep it up forever . I know . But for now , I 'm just gonna enjoy the win . Mike : Hey , Jules . What was it you were trying to tell me earlier ? You know , when Kane was about to snag us and obliterate us and everything ? It can wait . [ dance music plays ] Kane : Tooley !

 Brandon , no matter what , you just walk ahead . Promise me you won 't look back . Okay . It 's going to be okay . All right ? I 'll be right back . Ivy monroe . Do you have any idea how early it is ? Hey , i thought you were gonna call me about that wedding gig this weekend . Oh . Right . Sorry . Yeah . You sound tired . Are you getting enough sleep ? No , no . Not so much . Bad dreams again ? Yeah , yeah . Same one . You know , my dad and the car crash . Ivy , i 'll call you back . Nice talking to you , too . Hang on , i 'm coming ! " Dear mr . Davis , " we regret to inform you of your grandfather 's passing . You have been named executor of his estate . " I missed you , son . I missed you too , dad . Late ... as usual , brandon . Yeah . Sorry , jenna . How was your morning ? Mine sucked . Found out my grandfather died , and he left me in charge of his whole estate . I see . That creepy old house ? Didn 't you shoot those old death portraits there ? Actually , that was my great-grandfather , and his work was just granted an exhibit at the natural history museum . So , he 's quite respected in the world of photography . Speaking of being quite respected , are you going to be able to pay support this month ? You know bobby 's got a birthday coming up , and his speech therapy bills are overdue again . Son , you want to get your stuff ? There is nothing wrong with him , jenna . It 's just sometimes it seems like he doesn 't want to speak . Yeah , well , maybe if you 'd been around more often , he 'd be speaking by now . We 're gonna do this again ? Look , bobby really looks up to you . He really does . He even asked for a camera for his birthday just so he could be just like you . Bobby . I will always care about you , jenna , always . I know you don 't approve of me chasing my dream ... but it 's in my blood . I feel it . And you might call it destiny . Destiny . You 'll find your destiny , too , son . Well , as far as destiny goes , make sure he gets to school on monday , okay ? Come here , baby . Have a safe trip . Now ... your mom can 't know about any of this . Right ? You ready ? Oh , hang on . Your very own camera . Wow . It 's quite a place . Guess it runs in the family . Bobby . It 's all right . Do me a favor , son . Stay here while i go upstairs . You 'll be all right . Just stay where i can see you . Bobby ... help me . Bobby ! Bobby ? Bobby , are you all right ? I told you to stay put . Oh , my god . This can 't be . This is my grandfather 's camera . God , you are so beautiful . I have always wanted to shoot with something like this . This is like ... destiny . Destiny . Exactly , bobby . Destiny . Son ... we 've got work to do . Destiny . Exactly , bobby . Destiny . Hey . Time to shut it down . Where 'd you get that ? The house ? Can i see ? Wow . That is really old . Saint vincent 's cemetery . Son , you ever heard the term , " saved by the bell " ? Well , a long time ago , when people were buried , they weren 't entirely sure if the person was dead or not , so , they take a bell just like this one , and they attach a string , and it 'd go all the way down into the grave , and the person could ring the bell- - and they would be saved . Saved by the bell . You were really scared tonight , weren 't you ? You know i 'll always be there for you , right ? So , no matter where you go , you take that bell , and you ring it , and i will find you , and i will save you . I love you too , son . Now , go to sleep . Wow . These photos are really cool . They 're so creepy . So , your great grandfather was actually wenton davis , the death portrait photographer ? He was a great talent . His eye for light , shadow , composition , it was just- - it was legendary . See , death photography was very popular back in the late 1800 's . It could capture a person 's essence for life . In fact , it could make them immortal . Hm . Hm . I 'm going to make you famous . Subjects were posed , propped up with ingeniously-made stands . Too tight ? No . People didn 't understand what he was doing . He was creating life . Life after death . Well , these photos are wicked . Man , i can 't believe people used to actually do things like this . Yeah , well , eventually , it became obsolete . People found it distasteful . My dear child . I 'll help you . Yes , i will help you . But my great-grandfather was responsible for the last death portrait . Mm-hm . The sickest one , too . Well , sick or not , it would be nice to have an exhibit at the natural history museum , and be famous like him . Whatever . You 're famous to me . So , um ... what did you want to show me so badly that you had me drive all the way down here for ? Or did you just miss me ? I wanted to show you this . Ta-da ! Oh , my god . Is this actually your great grandfather 's camera ? Yep . The same camera that took those death portraits ? The one and only . Man , that is so cool . Did you steal it ? What ? No , i didn 't steal it . I found it at my grandfather 's house . Do you even know how to use this thing ? Yeah , of course i know how to use it . I took a class in college on plate grass photography with professor jay mcklaren , who 's a- - a friend of my father 's . Actually , you may know him . He 's , um- - he 's that crazy photo historian . Wait , yeah . The creepy old guy that looked like a wax figure . Yeah , that was the one . And , um ... i 've already used it . Oh , really ? Yeah . I found this homeless guy . He was rough , but he was the perfect subject . Don 't move . Perfect . And one more thing . We 're going to use this for the wedding . They are still . They 're beautiful . Through me , they become immortal . Yes . That guy on the right is big jim johnson , and his son billy . You should get to know him . He 's rich and he 's single . You know i only like broke , married guys . Jim , stand perfectly still . You 're going to ruin your portrait . But i think we can fix that . Time for you , my dear . Um , maybe- - maybe later . Go ahead . Ivy , everything okay ? Yeah . No , it 's fine . I 'm- - i 'm going to get something to drink . Bride and groom , stand perfectly still . Okay , that is why i don 't drink anymore . Doctor monroe 's in the house . Come on . I have the perfect thing to make you feel better . Hang on . We 've got to get back to work . Um- - i 'm sorry . I can 't . You 're still in love with her , you jerk . God . Stupid me , i 'm such an idiot . Ivy , i 'm married . Hey , you know , don 't flatter yourself . I had too much to drink is all . Get back to work . " Camera obscura . " Wow . This place is great . Breaking news coming right up after sports and weather . Keep it right here on wrkj news talk radio . Is there something i can help you find , miss ? Yeah . Um . Do you have any more of this stuff ? In maybe a bigger a bottle ? I haven 't seen this in forever . Excuse me , miss . Professor , how was lunch ? It was good . Hey , how 's that book of yours ? Just fine , george . Well , i 'm sure it 'll be a top seller . Don 't you have something to do , george ? I 'll go in the back to see if there 's a larger bottle . Thanks . You 're welcome . Do i know you ? Mcklaren . Professor jay mcklaren . Ivy monroe . So ... you are a photographer ? Oh , i wish . No , i just work for one . Anyone i might know ? Brandon davis ? Davis ... as in wenton davis ? Yeah , that 's brandon 's grandfather . His great grandfather . Oh , yes , brandon . He was in my photography 101 class , i believe . Yeah , you know , actually , he just mentioned you . Oh , quite the coincidence . I was just thinking about him , myself . You see , i am writing a book about the great wenton davis . Quite a fascinating fellow he was . Well , brandon just got wenton 's old camera . He 's so excited . You mean that death camera ? Uh-huh . I was wondering if you would not mind giving brandon my card . I would love to chat with him about his great grandfather . All right , looks like we have a 24-ounce bottle . Here you go , miss . Oh ... and miss monroe , i 'd stay away from that camera if i were you . Really ? Why 's that ? Because a lot of people tend to die around it . Have a nice day . Koo-koo . Wrkj news talk radio . $ 10 . Breaking news just in , it was a tragic day here , as local resident jim johnson and his son billy were found dead in the hillcrest park area . Police reports say the bodies had been mangled and skinned alive . Oh , my god , i knew them . Further details pending an investigation . Just separate about two inches . There 's something crawling on my leg . Jenna , i really appreciate you doing this . Especially in this place , and , uh , you look beautiful . Right here . Mm , thanks , brandon . It 's creepy . You 're sure that thing even works , anyways ? Yeah , absolutely , it works . We just used it at a big wedding . I haven 't seen the final product , yet , but i guarantee you it 's a portrait to die for . Brandon . Hey , are you back yet ? Hey , brandon , you back ? What the hell ? Just ... hold still . Brandon , this is ivy . Look , something real bad is happening . Just- - i- - i can 't explain it . Just call me back . Mcklaren ... i 'd stay away from that camera if i were you . A lot of people tend to die around it . Oh , my god . Mcklaren . Professor mcklaren ? What are you doing here ? I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to intrude , you weren 't here , and i really think i need your help . Oh . How can i help you ? I need to show you something , but i don 't want you to think i 'm crazy or anything . Crazy ? That 's a good one . That 's what they usually say about me . Crazy ? Over what ? I have my suspicions . Not all is at it seems with brandon and that camera he 's been messing with . Oh , my god , so you do know something . I thought i was the only one . I know a lot of things ! I used to know brandon 's father . Such a tragedy , his death and all . You mean the accident ? Accident ? Really ! I would hardly call destiny an accident ! What do you mean , destiny ? What are you talking about ? Look , professor , there 's something going on here . I can 't explain , but i think you need to see this . Where did you get these ? Brandon found them in his grandfather 's house with the camera . These are wenton davis original death portraits , aren 't they ? I believe so . Wenton was a strange man . He loved his work . He was obsessed with death . Oh . And capturing images of it . Oh , nice . But something went terribly wrong . Damn it , girl ! Why can 't you just stay dead still ? What happened ? I 'm not sure . Do- - do these photos tell you anything ? Oh , yes . Do you see ... how the living in these photos are slightly blurry , while the deceased are clearly sharp in every detail . That 's because the dead are still dead still . Not even breathing . You see , back then , technology was not as it is today . The camera could only capture images that were absolutely still . I believe ... this proves my theory . I 've seen it in a lot of his work . Proves what theory ? Perhaps our meeting was a mistake , miss monroe . It 's probably best that you leave now- - for your own good ! Leave ? What are you talking about ? Look , something evil , supernatural even , is happening . I believe that . And the people in these photos are dead now . It wasn 't an accident that we met the other day , was it ? You followed me here , didn 't you ? What do you want from me ? What i want to know is when brandon found that camera , did he find a journal as well ? Look , i don 't know anything about a journal . I just need to know what 's going on . What 's going on is ... the people in these photographs are still breathing . Oh- - find the journal and destroy the camera . Brandon is innocent , you 'll see . You will never write that journal . I will stop you . Journal . Brandon , where are you ? This ... is me . Damn ! Why can 't you stay still ? And the people in these photos are dead now . This can 't be happening . No , this isn 't real . Come on , brandon , pick up the phone . Ivy ? Oh , thank god you answered ! Is everything okay ? No , everything is not okay . Look , whatever you do , do not use that camera . There 's something evil about it . What are you talking about ? Look , stop kidding around . I 'm not kidding . Look , when you found that camera , did you find a journal too ? Journal ? Ivy ... i talked to the professor . You talked to who ? Ivy ? Ivy , you 're breaking up on me . Ivy ? Ivy , you 're breaking up on me . Bobby ... help me . Get away from that camera ! You could have broken it ! Did you really need to do that , brandon ? I 'm sorry . Take my picture . I 'm going to make you famous . Detective calhoun from homicide . Mr. Davis , you live here ? Yeah , i live here , officer . " Detective , " mr . Davis . All right . Sorry , detective . So what 's happening ? Well , it seems that this poor young lady was murdered . She was murdered ? Yeah , and we found this next to the body . Mcklaren . Do you know this man ? Mr. Davis . Mr. Davis , do you know this man ? No . What about the girl ? Do you know her ? Bobby , take the back way up . Go to your room and watch t.v. or something . Do not leave until i get there . Do as you 're told . Can i have a look ? Yeah . Her name is ivy monroe . She 's my assistant and ... good friend . She just called me . How the hell did this happen ? We don 't know yet , but i 'd love to get my hands on the sick puppy who did this . That 's for sure . Did she mention anything strange when she called you ? When you found that camera , did you find a journal too ? Journal ? No . Nothing . Nothing at all . Nothing , huh ? Is there something you want to tell me , mr . Davis ? Yeah . I need to go upstairs and be with my son . He 's scared . Sure . We 'll need a full statement later . Oh , and , mr . Davis ? Don 't be taking any trips any time soon , okay ? This is just gruesome . You think this is gruesome ? You should have seen the homeless guy that we found in the alley yesterday . His body was turned inside out , twisted like some dirty , old dishrag . I didn 't shoot these . Subjects were posed , propped up with ingeniously-made stands . His body was turned inside out , twisted like some dirty , old dishrag . What about the girl ? Oh , my god . Ivy . I have always wanted to shoot for something like this . Hope , destiny . God , what have i done ? Hold still . Jenna . Come on , jenna . Jenna . Jenna , pick it up . Pick it up . Come on . Come on . Come on . Come on . Journal . Bobby . Bobby . Jen , it 's me . Where the hell are you ? Look , i don 't know if you have reception where you are , but just- - call me . I love you . Hello ? I know there 's somebody here . Mcklaren , is that you ? How the vile and the depraved , waste our precious air , breathing like they count or even matter . I 'm doing a great service for mankind . I am the cleanup man , cleaning up everyone 's ugliness ... and creating beauty . Wenton . This is his journal . Who are you ? Are you trying to kill me ? What do you want ? You 're just like him . You killed them . You killed them all . I didn 't kill anybody . Memento mori . Remember , now you too must die . Look , i don 't want to hurt you . I just came for the book . Proof of his evil . Proof of what ? Proof that he is a murderer . And now , so are you ! But i haven 't killed anybody . I just take pictures . Memento mori . You have the blackness within . You also must be banished . It is the way of the curse . Curse ? What curse ? People die , and they end up in these crazy , death portraits . Everyone i love died . You really don 't know , do you ? Who are you ? Who i am is not important . It 's who you are that concerns us . My name is zamora braniski . We have a lot in common , you and i . I doubt that . My great grandmother knew your great grandfather . She knew him very well , in fact . He killed her . It was a spell of containment and damnation . A legacy handed down through generations . You might even say it was my destiny . Wenton was cursed . His life 's essence was extracted and transferred into the camera , the negative world . There , he would remain trapped , unable to hurt anybody again . His evil contained forever . How do i stop him ? In order to stop wenton ... and free the innocent souls trapped with him , the truth must be exposed through his own words . The journal . Exactly . How do i find him ? Don 't worry . He 'll find you . I 'm going to take this . I know exactly what i have to do . Help us . Help us . Help us . This ... is ... over ! Damn you to hell , wenton . It 's over . Wenton may be dead , but his spirit is very much alive inside the camera . It 's over . Hey . Bobby , i 'm home . Oh , son of a bitch . Bobby ? Bobby , where are you ? Bobby ! Damn , i told you to stay in the house . Come on , jenna . Pick up the damn phone . Bobby ! I 'm going to make you famous . Hello ? I can speak . Hello ? Bobby ! Bobby . Bobby ! Dad ! Hello ? Dad ! Shh . Stay still . Where are we ? The negative world . My name 's bobby . My name is lela . What was that ? The negatives . The negatives ? Yes . They 're the lost souls . They don 't want to be here . They aren 't like you and me . They 're dead . Am i still alive ? Yes , silly . We both are . In here , i have a voice . I can speak . Well , of course you can . We need to go now . They 'll be awake soon . It 's feeding time . Come on ! Bobby ! Dad ! No . Dad , where 's mom ? Oh , jenna . Through you ... he can now kill again and carry on with his sick collection , his precious death portraits . He 's in here with us . Bobby ? Damn you to hell . Damn you to- - dad ? Dad , please help me . Bobby ? You can speak . Son , where are you ? I don 't know . It 's dark . I 'm afraid . I heard the bell . I- - i heard the bell . You stay put . I will save you . You stay put . Dad , where 's mom ? She 's , uh ... she 's resting . She 's not feeling well . You can speak . Dad , please help me ! Help me ! Dad , help me ! Help me ! There 's something coming ! No ! Come and get him , boy . Yeah . You want me . I 'm coming for you . Portrait time . Bring it . Bobby ! Bobby ! Son ? You should watch , boy . One day , you 're going to be just like me . Okay , sure . I 'll teach you . I thought you 'd never ask . Problem is ... they always just have to start breathing . Then they ruin all of my portraits ! There . Hear no evil . Speak no evil . See no evil . Your daddy 's coming for you , boy . He 's coming . Bobby ? Bobby ? The curse was supposed to contain him , but something went wrong , terribly wrong . The souls of his victims became trapped there as well , the negative world . I will be remembered . But this was not enough . He needed a vessel . A living entity to continue his destiny . Bobby ? Bobby ! Bobby ! Where did you get that ? Bobby . You 've seen my son ? He 's my friend . Where is- - whoa , whoa . Your name is ... you 're lela , right ? How do you know that 's my name ? You have a doll named , uh ... daisy . Daisy . How do you know all of this ? I know someone who loves you very much . Come . We need to find bobby . Come on . Come on . Don 't be scared . Lela . He 's coming , boy ! He 's coming ! You 're a pretty one , aren 't you , huh ? Lovely to see you again , my dear . You don 't remember me , do you , girl ? You are my greatest masterpiece . My plan worked perfectly . Oh , thank you , lela , for leading them to me . You should thank me , boy . Your son now has the courage to speak again . Unlike you , he has faced his fears . Well , we 'll just have to rough it . Pain can be our friend . Then after that , we can run a little test on your son 's brand new voice , while he screams in excruciating pain . Huh ? Come on , they 're coming ! You cannot escape ! Do not deny your destiny . After all , it runs in the family . Destiny ? We 're nothing like you . You 're a cold-blooded killer . I see people as they are . Monsters . Monsters ? These were innocent people ! Men , women , children . They were alive when you took their portraits ! Oh , you 're crazy , boy . Really ? Yes . Really ? Collodion ? A chemical used to develop negatives in glass-plate photography . Can also be used ... to cause respiratory and physical paralysis . It would make them perfectly still . Sleep now . Sleep . Just like the dead . But there 's one small problem , just a little one . They began to breathe ... and move . Damn it , girl ! Why can 't you just stay dead still ? I think we can fix that . You don 't remember me , do you , girl ? You are my greatest masterpiece . You , my dear , are my master portrait . Help us . Help us . When they are still , they 're beautiful . Through me , they become immortal . You 're insane . You 're a murderer . I will always be known as a great artist ! My work will live on forever . You killed all of those people . Some of them were buried alive . I read your journal . I know everything . You know nothing ! Nothing ! Well , you may have some secrets ... but i 've got one of my own . I gave everything ... the journal , the portraits , all of it , to your new biographer . Yeah , you 're going to be famous again . Such a shame . Your reputation destroyed , your legacy tarnished . Your secrets are no longer secrets . Once a great man ... now the freak . The world will know . Both worlds . Mine ... and yours . No one will ever destroy my camera ! I will you all ! Memento mori . Remember , now you too must die . This is not the end . No . This is your destiny . One of you is going to stay here . So choose . I used to admire you . Now you disgust me . You 're no better than me , boy . You 're a killer just like i am . You let your own daddy die . You let your woman die . You killed the mother of your child . Now you 'll let your son die ... unless you choose . Time 's up ! I choose . I choose bobby boy . No ! You stay back now . Oh ... look at you , you 're still a coward . Just like when i killed your daddy . You 've taken everybody i love ... but you 're not going to take my son . Not my son ! Damn you ! Oh , i 'm damned , boy ! I 'm damned ! So are you ! Bobby ! Bobby ! Bobby . You okay ? Bobby ! Go to the light . Once you are inside , a great sacrifice will need to be made . Go to the light . Promise me . Promise me , son . Bobby . Go to the light . Take lela 's hand . Go to the light . Promise me . Take lela 's hand ... and go . Lela ? It 's okay . You can go home . Daisy is waiting . Daisy . We 're going home . You go first . I love you , son . I love you . I love you , dad . We 're ready for our portrait , bobby . Now stay still . Dead still .

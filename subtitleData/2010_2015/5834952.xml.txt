 In ancient times , people believed the heavens were filled with gods and monsters and magical worlds . Then , as time passed , those beliefs faded into myth and folklore . But now we know the stories were true . Other worlds , with names like Asgard , do exist . And beings once revered as gods , like Thor , have returned . Leaving us with more questions and an enormous mess to clean up . Don 't say I never gave you anything . Checking for alien spectrographic signatures , one teeny rock at a time . A necessary precaution . We don 't want anything alien getting in the wrong hands . Still , this is definitely the type of work a monkey could easily do . You 're our little monkey . Don 't give me that look . I 'll talk to them when I talk to them . - Talk to who ? - Mum and Dad . They want explanations and answers for ... Well , all this . But I don 't have any answers . And more importantly , I haven 't talked to them since I was ill . And if they knew that , they 'd be even more terrified , so , you know . Why waste any of our time , really ? You guys may think it 's old news , but it 's new news to everybody else . So , Asgardians are aliens from another planet - that visited us thousands of years ago . - Or more . And because we couldn 't understand aliens , we thought they were gods ? That 's where our Norse mythology comes from . That 's too crazy . Do you think other deities are aliens , too ? Vishnu for sure , right ? You know , it 'd be nice if , for once , Thor and his people sent down the god of cleaning-up-after-yourself . He 'd probably have a magic broom for this kind of thing . I just wish they 'd left their alien ship behind . - So we can clean that up , too ? - So we could go inside . Take a peek under the hood , maybe take it for a spin . Come on , you 're telling me piloting an alien ship isn 't on your bucket list ? I can 't think of a single time when anything alien in human hands ended well . Wouldn 't mind getting my human hands on Thor . He 's so dreamy . Sure , he 's handsome , but ... No . He 's dreamy . Fitz , is that ... um ... Definitely not from here . Another piece of the ship . What are you doing ? Out of sight , out of mind . It 's why we 're here . To keep everything under control . Now , who would do something like that ? Ah , who knows ? Baby , look . " South of the water , north of the hill , " a halo of stones ... " " Protect the tree , still . " Jakob . Is this it ? We should check that out . Finally , after all this time . I can 't wait to tell the others . I told you it was real . And that I would find it . Are you ready ? What you 're feeling , don 't fight it . That rage , it 's already inside of you . Don 't be afraid of it . Don 't hide from its power . Embrace it ! Embrace it ! Oh , God ! What have you done ? I can climb it if you want . Just talk me through what to do with the doodads . Yeah , it 's only about 15 feet . I 'll be fine . I 'm just a bit more wary about the height thing , since falling to certain death ... You 're afraid ? Hmm ? Shaken up ? It 's normal . But some feelings will take over if you dwell on them . Especially fear . Now , keep your eyes ahead , focus on what you like to do best . Yep . Not falling . No , research . You 're a scientist , you like to figure things out . Yes , with my doodads . I 'm curious . Whatever was up in these trees had to be there for centuries , right ? At least a millennium . Radiocarbon-14 dates some of these trees at 9,000 years old . That sounds impossible . You think the tree grew around it ? I 'd have to check the dendrochronology first to know for certain . But , I mean , the Norway spruce is a rather fast-growing coniferous . And I know you 're trying to trick me into going up , but I 'm going up anyway . I 'll catch you if you fall . ... screaming , so much hate in her eyes . And you said she had a silver stick ? Steel , maybe , I don 't know . It , um , it had decorations on it . Could you describe or draw them ? I didn 't get a good look . I just ran . Who would do something so evil ? I 'm sorry for your loss . Huh , um ... Whatever was in here was definitely not from this world . Fitz , you getting this ? It 's not Chitauri , is it ? No . No , no , don 't worry . This isn 't another viral threat . Um ... Hang on . Spectrographic signatures match readings from Thor 's hammer . Simmons , whatever was in that tree is Asgardian . I can see an imprint of what was embedded . Scanning for three-dimensional restoration . Tell me when . When . Um ... Looks like a staff or a rod . Well-crafted , engraved . I 'll convert it , print a 3D model . This forest is a protected reserve . I mean , who do they think they are ? Anything else ? Details ? Anything that might help us to find these people or where they might be hiding ? Sir , it doesn 't look like they 're hiding . ... in an attempt to stop the growing violence . Sending to your devices now . The rioting has left 20 injured , three in critical condition . Reports indicate that the group of about a dozen was led by this man and woman . And though their motive was unclear , their message was hauntingly spelled out on the streets of Oslo . Well , I guess we know who they think they are . Jakob Nystrom , 30 . Girlfriend , Petra Larsen . Leaders of a Norse paganist hate group . And the numbers are growing , thanks to what happened in Greenwich , and thanks to the Internet . " Yay , internet , " she said sarcastically . Norse paganist ? Obsessed with anything derived from Norse mythology . Stories of Asgard . And now a weapon . The scan only accounted for one side . Too much damage to the tree for complete reproduction . But see here ? It 's clearly broken on both ends . - So there are more pieces ? - Yeah . Two , at least . Which means Sid and Nancy may be looking for a complete set . - The markings ? - Asgardian symbolism . Hard to translate with our limited knowledge . You should give your buddy , the God of Thunder a shout . He gets his power from his hammer , right ? What if this is his nail to the hammer ? I already did . Director Fury told me he 's off the grid . And if he has a cell phone , we don 't have the number . S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s investigations are on the trail of Nystrom and his followers . We 're charged with identifying the object and finding any other pieces before they do . They seem to have some advantage . They found this thing in 150 square kilometers of Norwegian forest . Guys , what if it called to them with magic ? Called to them ? We know it 's Asgardian , so the rules are a little bendy here . Just because we don 't understand something yet doesn 't mean we should regress back to the Dark Ages , talking of magic and fairytale . Actually , that 's exactly what we 're going to do . - Excuse me ? - Really ? When we first found the hammer in New Mexico , I consulted one of the world 's leading experts on Norse mythology . Elliot Randolph . A professor at a university in Seville . We 'll leave immediately . Maybe he can tell us more about these markings . Well , one must adapt , Elena . Recent events have thrown us all for a loop . I thought I was teaching Norse mythology . No , turns out , I 'm a history professor . So , you 're not going to change my grade ? No . I will give you a week to rewrite it . I think , in general , little more history , less lit crit . But I do hope we 're still on for dinner tonight . I 've included a list of books there that might help you . I 'll see you later . - Professor Randolph . - Agent Coulson . Come in , come in . Waterfield 44 . 14 karat gold nib with mother-of-pearl inlay . That 's quite an eye you 've got . I didn 't know you were a collector . On a government salary , not quite . Well , I 'm assuming you found something on the ground in London ? In a tree in Norway , and unfortunately , we weren 't the ones who found it . It 's a 3D model . Oh , that is amazing . Well , based on these runes , I 'd say I 'm looking at a piece of the Berserker staff . Let 's have a look . Yeah , the myth dates back to the late 12th century . It 's all about a powerful warrior from Asgard . Here . A soldier in the Berserker Army . Berserker Army ? Oh , yeah . A powerful army . Fierce army , it was . Berserkers battled like raging beasts , destroying everything in their path . A single Berserker had the strength of 20 warriors . So whoever wielded the staff got superhuman strength ? Fighting with it put the warrior into a state of uncontrollable rage . The staff contained a very powerful magic . Or a scientific attribute we 've yet to discover . Analytically-minded and pretty as a peach . The warrior in the story ? Well , in the story , he came to Earth to fight , but he ended up falling in love . With whom ? With life on Earth . Humanity . He fell so much in love that , when his army returned to Asgard , he stayed behind . What happened to the staff ? Well , he didn 't want its dark magic falling into the wrong hands . So he broke it into three pieces , and hid each one in a different location . The manuscript wouldn 't happen to say where he hid them , would it ? Actually , it does . In three verses . Now , let 's all bear in mind , these are poetic abstracts from long-lost ancient texts . So , there is one about a tree , which they found , it seems . Another is , " East of the river , sun overhead . " Buried in earth with the bones of the dead . " That 's a bit macabre , isn 't it ? And there 's another here . Well , this one doesn 't even have a rhyme . But the gist of it is " close to God . " - That could be anything , couldn 't it ? - Could also mean nothing . I was hoping for less metaphor , more longitude and latitude . Well , I mean , it does stand to reason to search near Viking raid routes , doesn 't it ? There have been some recent interesting findings of Norse relics on Baffin Island , off the coast of Canada . Yeah , a virtual treasure trove of new artifacts . We 'll start there then . Thank you , Professor . Did you know there 's a Mount Thor on Baffin Island ? I did not . You know what 's not on Mount Thor ? Anything Asgardian at all . Our agents on the ground haven 't found a thing . What about you ? Nystrom 's Deep Web message boards are just abuzz with psychos . They believe they 're gonna ascend to be the " gods of destruction and death . " People suck , sir . That 's your progress ? People suck ? These people do . And there 's also chatter about going underground . Could mean going incognito ... Or searching for the next piece . Randolph said to check Viking routes . Find any others ? There 's some sites along the Volga River in Russia . Some in Kiev , and , weirdly , here . In Seville , Spain ? It 's a long shot , but Vikings sacked Seville twice . We found one promising location with Viking relics . El Divino Nino , a church built on the ruins of an 8th century crypt , built on Roman ruins from 206 BC . - East of a river . - And lots of bones . Let 's see what we can dig up . See what I did there ? Must be nice . Have a mandatory nap time . Siesta isn 't mandatory . Just very pleasant . - How you doing , Agent Ward ? - Wishing I was shorter . Nothing yet . All my readings are normal . What about you , Skye ? Any luck ? I 'm lucky my S.O. volunteered to take the super creepy hallway , instead of the slightly less creepy dungeon room place . I got nothing . Sorry , nada . Ward , your spectrograph is reading something near you . I don 't see anything . Well , it 's right in front of you . Oh , wait , no . Uh , okay , hold on . It 's moving . Northwest . Visual contact . Okay , Ward , turn left . I have a wonderful explanation . Ran into some unexpected ... - Ward , what 's happening ? - His device just went down . - Skye , can you get ... - Already on it . Ward , are you all right ? Hey , hey , hey , whoa , whoa , whoa . Grant , calm down . Oh , my God , please . Calm down . The staff , he has it . Somethings wrong with Ward . The staff 's gone . Someone took it . I have one , too . He can 't just disappear . He 'll have to turn up somewhere . There we go . A block south of the church . - Professor ? - I screwed up . - This is ridiculous . - It 's anything but . Ward , you passed out . And you were acting not right . Coulson ordered me to give you a full work up , and that 's exactly what I 'm doing . Um , before you lost consciousness , were you feeling claustrophobic ? - Why ? - She 's ruling out a panic attack . I don 't panic . Ever . There we go . Ruled out . Touching the staff caused it , right ? Any residual effects ? Are you exhibiting any extra strength ? Why don 't I find out on that guy ? Why don 't we not do that ? What 's the last thing you remember before you lost consciousness ? This is a waste of time . We need to find the staff . What exactly did you remember ? Something I hadn 't thought about in a long time . Why don 't we leave it alone ? I mean , he just pulled his arm out ... Quiet ! I want to hear this . One of my men is hurt , the staff is gone ... I didn 't want any of that to happen . What did you want ? - The staff 's power for yourself ? - Nothing like that . You know , I just wanted to be the first to study it . To prove that the Berserkers were actually here , a part of history . You think about that . Oh , I 'm thinking about it . What are you doing ? Your heart rate 's rising , adrenaline 's spiking . You need to calm down , not get worked up . The memory , was it about your brother ? Drop it . Ward , if you need to get it out , I am here ... Right . To talk . Because that 's what you do . Talk and talk . Don 't you ever get tired of hearing your own voice ? Ward , stop . Well , this makes more sense . Ward , what you 're experiencing , this feeling ? It 's chemistry . Hope so . Yeah , spikes in his adrenocorticotropic hormone . It 's like those stories you hear when a mother is able to lift a car to save her baby . An adrenaline surge can create a massive ... Stop talking ! Just fix it ! I wish I could . We can relieve some of the symptoms . I 'm going to give you 1 O cc : ' s of benzodiazepine . Chill pill . Good idea . A sedative ? Not gonna happen . Yeah , well , be reasonable . Look how you 're behaving . And if I 'm sedated and we cross paths with those juiced freaks , the ones who flip cars and smash people up , are you gonna take them on ? Keep us safe ? Or am I gonna have to save Simmons ' ass again ? That was just a biochemical reaction . He didn 't mean all that . - No , I know . - No explanation necessary . - How 'd they find it ? - I have no idea how they found it . They may have the original texts . I wasn 't involved . You know , it was just a chance to uncover something that the gods brought down from the heavens . Aliens brought it . From space . I 've spent some one-on-one time with aliens before . Didn 't work out too well . So cases like this are personal to me . That 's all I know . Get comfortable . Help me ! Please ! Help me ! Help me ! Ward ! Hey , Ward ! You should be more careful . I 'm fine . You ? I 'm working it out . You 're punching things . The last thing you need is to punch things . You got a better idea ? Let me help you . The only help I need is to stop those guys before they hurt somebody else . We are the new order ! Our world is being taken by gods ! We will become gods and take it back ! This is the new order ! Are you ready to take back the power ? - A moment , sir ? - Come on in . I 'm concerned that my exposure to that weapon has compromised my ability to do my job . Go on . You 're familiar with my family history ? So , for obvious reasons , I don 't think back to childhood . Ever . There are things I put away a long time ago , on lockdown . Because to do this , I have to be focused , tactical . I can 't be distracted . Especially by things that happened a lifetime ago . You 're saying touching the staff unlocked certain memories ? My worst memory . The first time I felt hate . And it won 't go away . I don 't trust myself . The way I went off at Skye and Fitz-Simmons in the lab ... Grant , you telling me this makes me feel I can trust you . Him , on the other hand ... I can 't get the Professor to talk . You 've got some rage built up . Maybe it 's time to let it out . You need to start talking . I told Agent Coulson everything I know . You 're lying . Tell me what that thing did to me and how to fix it . I swear , I don 't know . Okay , then . You were right . He 's Asgardian . Good thing . Otherwise that would 've been awfully embarrassing . Okay , I have to know . How did you figure me out ? Did the math . One , you 're not the first Asgardian I 've had in custody . You guys don 't flinch or panic in captivity . Two , a Waterfield 44 on a lit professor 's salary ? I don 't think so . And lastly , when I tell someone I 've had some one-on-one time with an alien , they tend to be a little curious . Well , you 're certainly more observant than most , Agent Coulson . So , you 're the Asgardian warrior who stayed . Please don 't tell anyone . I had no clue . Did you ? Hidden in plain sight . An actual Asgardian . Brilliant . How long do you suppose he 's been on our planet ? A thousand years , maybe more . If we could just cut him open a little bit , get some tissue samples , maybe some bodily fluids , we could find out . Or we could just ask him , weirdo . This is way , way better than The History Channel . I mean , this guy has lived through all the scary stuff . The Crusades , the Black Death , disco . What 're you doing ? Sealing the interrogation room door . Coulson 's orders . Ah , locking me in . Well , I 've been in tighter spots . This room is made of a silicon carbide-coated vibranium alloy . Meant for prisoners like yourself . But you 're in here , too . And eventually , somebody will open that door . Not if I tell them not to . So , the myth is your autobiography ? I didn 't write it . I didn 't want anyone to know about me . Then I had to open my big mouth . Were you captured ? Tortured ? Horny . I met a French girl in 1546 . God , she loved stories . So I told her a great one . All about the peaceful Asgardian warrior who stayed . Now , how was I to know her brother , the priest , would write it all down and turn it into , I don 't know , a thing ? Do you know Thor ? Oh , sure . I spent all my days palling around with the future king of Asgard . No , I don 't know Thor . I was a mason . I broke rocks . For thousands of years , if you can imagine that . So when they came asking for people to fight , yes , ' course I signed up . I think , really , I just wanted to travel . But you had the staff . I hated that thing . Other guys loved all the power that comes with the rage . No . I didn 't like it at all . And you don 't either , it seems . What did it do to me ? It shines a light into your dark places . Doesn 't matter if you 're human , Asgardian , the effect is the same . Unpleasant . " Shines a light " ? That 's no explanation . It was forged from a rare metal and reacts to whoever is holding it . Or interacts . I went to such great lengths to make sure that the staff wasn 't found . Unfortunately , since the myth was written down , people have been searching for it for centuries . I need your help to stop them before they get the last piece of your staff . No . I am a pacifist now . And you don 't want to risk your identity being discovered . Listen , I wouldn 't worry too much about these angry youths . They always calm down . And eventually , they die of old age . And that is one of the pleasant aspects of life here . Everything changes . I 'll tell you what 's gonna change . Your anonymity . Unless you help us find the final piece of your staff . You may not know Thor , but I do . My first love on this planet was Ireland . There was a monastery , and the monks gave me a nice warm place to sleep , some soup , and some mulled wine . " Near God . " The effects of the staff , are they permanent ? The strength wears off . You will feel exhausted . Afterwards , you 'll need sleep . What about the other effects ? Oh , that dark , nasty ache in the pit of your stomach ? The rage in your chest that makes you feel as if your heart 's about to explode ? It 's worse on humans . But give it a few decades and it 'll wear off , too . Great . Are you sure Ward 's okay to go into the field ? He 's not exactly acting like himself . But he knows it . He 'll be fine . I 'm with Coulson . It 's been a while . I wonder ... Ah ! Yes . There it is . Still here . Well , the nose isn 't quite right , but ... That 's you ? Yeah . They venerated me a bit as a saint . They 're idiots . - Where 's the staff ? - It 's upstairs . Was that the normal Ward , or the new , angrier Ward ? I can 't tell . It 's quiet . Why do you think I trusted them with my secret ? They take a vow of silence . But when you get them talking , they squeal . If you want to defeat a god , you must become one . We need to help him ! I 'll get her . How is he ? I don 't know what to do . He 's not human ! - He 's dying . - Yeah , we know , but she doesn 't understand his anatomy ... - Oh , my God ! - What in God 's name ... Sometimes you have to just jump in and figure things out . Now , Asgardians regenerate faster than we do . Maybe we can keep him alive long enough ... For his body to heal itself . - Okay , what am I looking for ? - His heart . Help me ! - Oh . Okay . I think I got it . Heart . - Oh ... Yeah . Can you feel a tear or rupture ? Clamp down hard on his heart . Try to slow the bleeding . - Grant . Drop the staff . - Get away from me . - Agent Ward ... - This isn 't you . Get back . Help me ! Please ! Please ! Grant ! Help me ! Grant , please ! Help me ! Grant ! - Not yet , Grant . - Help me ! - But he 's gonna ... - Not yet . Throw him the rope , and I throw you in there , too . Please ! Grant ! Oh , my God , are you okay ? Come here . Oh , you 've got to be kidding . This time , let me help . Yeah . Come on . I am not afraid of you . Am I dead ? Apparently not . You 're easily the most beautiful thing I 've seen in a thousand years . Coulson did that ? He just shoved his hand inside ? Well , he had to . I froze . Didn 't know what to do . Hey , you didn 't freeze . You just weren 't up for the idea of putting your hand inside somebody else 's chest . Maybe I should jump in . Yeah . Hi , Dad . Yeah , it 's great to hear your voice , too . I 've been meaning to call you for a couple of days . It 's been a difficult few weeks . When you held it , did you see anything ? Then how ? How did you hold all three ? Because I see it every day . I know that look . You 're tempted . Now , what is it you wanna see ? You and I have a lot in common . We 've both been stabbed in the heart . I was killed . Well , almost . I 'm hazy on that . Afterwards , it 's kind of a blank . I have no memory of being revived , of being in a hospital . Just woke up a few months later . And are you haunted by it , Mr. Coulson ? No . Not exactly . Then what 's the problem ? I suppose you 're right . Can we give you a lift back to the university ? Well , you know , with Europe 's new fascination with all things Asgardian , I 'm wondering if it 's time to start over somewhere else . A nice beach ? A life of tropical drinks and massages ? Mmm ... Well , I 'd get bored . You should consider the American Northwest . Maybe Portland . Good food scene . Great philharmonic . Well , if you will come and visit . It 's not everyone I get to share my stories with . Sure . And if Thor 's in town , I 'll introduce you . Hey . I could get used to turndown service and little mints on my pillow . Overnights aren 't standard . We deserve a nice night . You especially . How are you feeling ? Not great . I 'm sorry . For before . Um ... I 'm not that guy . You 're a guy who saves lives . I can overlook a little Hulk rage . No harm , no foul . Does everything just roll off your back ? No . If it helped , I 'd rage all the time , but it doesn 't . What I saw , it was about my brother . I figured . I know you 're not one to talk , but like I said , I 'm here . My shoulder 's free . I 'm beat . Another time maybe . Well , you know where I live . Did I fall asleep ? For a little while , but , uh , that 's good . It means you are relaxed . That 's precisely how I 'm feeling . Relaxed . Honestly , Tahiti 's too good to be true . I know . It 's a magical place .

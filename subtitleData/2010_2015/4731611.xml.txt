 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Mr. Lattimer , my name 's Frederic . What 's that ? An invitation to endless wonder . - No ! - Aah ... H.G. Wells was a formidable opponent . She fooled us all . You can 't blame yourself . It could have happened to any one of us . But I put the entire world in jeopardy . I can 't take that chance again . Let 's go , bomb squad . Another group ! What the hell were you doing in there ? For the hundredth time- - I told you , I work here ! I just brought some chick in after hours ... and she 's into Hendrix , so I grabbed his guitar ... Yeah , yeah , we know about the bomb , okay ? Bomb ? What bomb ? I was just trying to get lucky . Hey ... He 's telling the truth . Oh , come on , Steve . - Chuck , he 's not lying . - Yeah , yeah , yeah . You can always tell when somebody 's lying , right ? Lucky you and your special gift . Believe me , it 's not a gift to be able to tell when someone 's lying . - You ever been on a date ? - This guy is our only lead . The guy 's clean . There 's no bomb . Well , there 's something bad going down in there , okay ? It may not be any kind of bomb we 've seen before . Steve . Steve ! You listening ? Yes . Fine . Whatever . Hey , Steve ! Jeez . So ? Well , apparently some Casanova decides to play Hendrix 's guitar the same night that we want to swap it out . I thought we already had Hendrix 's guitar . That 's the one he torched at Finsbury Park . In ' 67 . Okay , listen , we 've gotta shut this down . Here , slip this on the nozzle . There 's too much errant electricity around here to risk using water . Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Now , Claudia , are you sure about this ? Abso--mostly . What 's that ? Voila ! Tesla grenade . Slow turn and hands , please . Listen , we work for the museum . We 're just here- - Lie . We 're under Presidential orders to shut this place- - Lie . Okay , that 's my guitar , and only , and only I can- - - Lie . - Even as we speak , this place is being surrounded by a legion of- - Oh , my God , quit lying ! All right , fine ! We are special agents who find and neutralize dangerous artifacts , and if she does not use Jimi Hendrix 's tremolo bar to bend the pitch on those strings right now , this place will go crazy enough to shut down the power grid on the eastern seaboard . Thank you . Okay , then , go ahead . ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ No , no ... What are you doing ? No , no , no , see , now you 're just playing with it . Well , yeah . It 's Hendrix 's guitar . - Which means that you should- - - Give it to you . Come on , trade me the replica . - Hey , are you okay ? - Thank you for saving me . Okay . Okay , come on . Come on . Who the hell are you people ? How could you tell I was lying ? No , no , no , I 'm asking the questions here . How 'd you guys even get in here ? You know what , could you open my bag for me just for a sec ? Thank you so much . See , I 've gotta turn this down because I 'm way too close . What is that ? Nothing for you to worry about . Oh , you 're lying . There , now I don 't have to lie to you anymore . You happy ? - Sorry about the cold . - Thank you so , so much . You saved my life . Oh , my God . Is he okay ? He 's fine . God , I love firemen . How can I ever thank you ? Here . Cover up . You 're freezing . Go wait by the exit . We 'll sneak you out with us , okay ? - Hey , Pete ? - Yeah ? Uh , that girl 's really grateful to you . - Uh-huh . - And cold . Really , really cold ? We could see how cold she was ? I gave her my jacket . Pete , uh , what Claudia 's trying to say is that you were uncharacteristically ... Restrained in the face of all that ... Coldness . Just doing the job . Let 's go . Come on . Okay , see , now even I miss the boob jokes . We 've gotta get Myka back . Steve , the director wants to see you . He 's not buying your story about the girl with the purple gloves , your story about the guy with the eyebrows , or all that stuff about dangerous artifacts . Turn on the light . We need to talk . What the hell ? Who are you ? How 'd you even get in here ? My name is Mrs. Frederic . I 'm with the government . I 'm here to make you an offer , Steven . What ? I have a position to fill , and you seem to fit the bill nicely . Are you kidding me ? You 're looking into my eyes , so you already know that I 'm not . I want to introduce you to a new world . Yeah , what kind of world ? A world of endless wonder . ♪ Warehouse 13 3x01 ♪ The New Guy Original Air Date on July 11 , 2011 = = sync , corrected by elderman = = I 'm sorry , sir , I have no listing in South Dakota for K39-triple-Z on the North American grid . Yeah , I didn 't think so . Holy smokes ! Sir , are you there ? Yeah ... I think I am . But I don 't want a new partner . Put your glasses on . There 's a reason why we 're unpacking Warehouse 2 in the ovoid quarantine ! Nobody asked me if I wanted a new partner . Yeah , well , this isn 't the army . We don 't poll our troops to get their opinion before we make a decision . Pete , really , glasses . Fine , fine , fine ! Look , Artie , you and Claudia were taking up the slack just fine . Oh , thank you so very much . The fact is I 'm too old , she 's too young , and we are both needed here . You need a new field partner . Someone who 's an equal , and someone who 's got experience ! All right , well , then , get Myka back . I have tried . Mrs. Frederic has tried . Here , here , send her one of Plato 's tablets . She loved these ! Pete ... We all miss her , but we have got work to do . Get your head with the program , 'cause the new guy 's gonna be here any minute . You know what ... It feels a little like my old dog just got sent to the farm , and you guys are already shoving a new puppy down my throat . Hey , new guy . You are the new guy , right ? You ... You had the tremolo bar and the purple gloves- - I saw you . Yes , it 's all true , Dorothy . Agent Claudia Donovan . Here ... New guy gets to fix the fish . Whoa , nice wheels . Prius , right ? I 've been looking at this baby myself . Sprang for the solar roof Nav Package I see . Shmancy . Listen , what , exactly , is Warehouse 13 ? What do you guys do out here ? JBL four-CD changer , of course . XM radio , cruise control , Bluetooth . Intelligent parking assist . iPod interface ? Well , well , well , somebody treated himself very nicely . End of the day , what 'd your mommy have to lay out for a car like this ? Agent Donovan . I 'm not here to sell you my car . Okay ? I know why you 're here . Follow me . Artie made cookies . That 'll buff out . Artie likes to think of this place as " America 's Attic , " but that 's really the nickname for the Smithsonian , so we need a new subtitle . Pete pitched " The World 's Junk Drawer , " but I quite like the " Library of Crazy , " or better yet , " Artifact Roadshow . " Don 't touch the bombs . Bombs ? I mean , I don 't need a guy who can tell when somebody 's lying . So what ? That 's nothing special . I mean , every nun I ever met could do that . Sister Mary Francis could tell when you were about to lie . I don 't care . You 're working with Agent Jinks starting today . Oh , and you 're gonna send me out on potentially life-threatening missions with someone named Jinks ? That 's just great , Artie . Steve , Artie . Artie , Steve . - Oh , hello . - You ... You 're the guy with the eyebrows . You neutralize the dangerous artifacts . Yes , when they misbehave . Agent Steve Jinks , meet your new partner- - this is Agent Pete Lattimer . Jinks , hey , man , how are you ? I 'm really looking forward to working with you . You 're lying . Oh , yeah , this is gonna be fun . Bob , I 'm telling you they 're all in Denver . At the Regalton . I don 't know , but when this many big bank CEOs are all in one place , it 's gotta be news . Miss Hopper ? Yes . Thank you . Yes , of course I 'll corroborate . I 've already got a guy on the inside . Hmm . Who knows I like figs ? Nothing . Look , I 'll file the story late tomorrow . The major bigwigs arrive in the morning- - ow ! Ow , something just bit me . Oh ... Bob ... Bob , help . Monica ? Oh ! Monica , quit clowning around . Is this a joke ? What 's going on ? Are you all right ? Oh , Antony , nay ... I will take thee too . Somebody call 911 , now ! Steve , welcome aboard . - You shot me with that thing . - You don 't want a cookie ? No . Yeah , but you did shoot me . Yes , it 's called a Tesla . It was invented by Nicola Tesla- - About 1,000 years ago , when Artie was a kid . Here 's an idea- - why doesn 't Jinksy just start here in the warehouse ? You know , learn the ropes , get his feet wet ... Yes . Miss Donovan could come with me . That 's exactly what I 've been saying . - Should I- - - No , we 're good . A decision has been made . Our job as Warehouse agents is to find whatever 's about to ruin the world 's day . Like finding Jimi Hendrix 's guitar . Precisely . Smart lad . Then snag it , bag it , and tag it . I like to think of this as- - America 's attic . Yes ... Amer--all right . Anyway ... Welcome to Warehouse 13 . Okay , that 's all we have time for . Now we 've got work to do . You guys get storms in here ? Um , sometimes . - I need my--gotta get- - - Wait , it 's operational . - No , it 's not . - Yes , it is . No , it 's not- - whoa , how did you do that ? My way . Finished installing it last night . That 's coming directly from the Ancient Archives . We 've gotta- - don 't just stand there . That 's a pyramid . There 's a pyramid in the warehouse . That 's right , Jinksy . We get on there , we could win $ 25,000 . - Joke , right ? You 're funny . - You 're not laughing . Well , I 'm not a laugher . Great . Perfect . Fun . Get in here ! What ? What ? What 's up ? - You fixed the pneumatic tubes . - Yep . - Did you--how did you ... - Nope . Imagine how such ingenuity could be put to use in the field . Are you ever gonna stop doing that ? No . Artie , you better get back down to the Ovoid . We have a situation . I 'll get right on it . All right , Pete , you and I are gonna check out the storm in the Ancient Archives . Claudia , you 're gonna take Steve . You 're gonna find out what is wrong in the Ovoid Quarantine . Ooh , what 's an Ovoid Quarantine ? It 's where we keep- - Uh-oh . - How long ago ? - Where is it ? A few hours . Denver . You still think we don 't need an extra set of hands ? Is something wrong ? - We got a ping . - We got a ping . You saw the report . It says the lady died of snakebite poisoning . A Russell 's Viper , no less . But nobody found any snakes anywhere . Hmm , yeah , well , check around . It sounds like it could be George Went Hensley 's Bible . - George Went where now ? - George Went Hensley . Yeah , he was a 20th-century snake-handling Bible-thumper from Tennessee . Got bitten 400 times in his life . The last one finally killed him in 1955 . Wow . George : 400 . 1 . Guess he could have used the shutout , eh , Jinksy ? Artie , this kid 's got no sense of humor . He doesn 't laugh at the jokes . - Your jokes , Pete ? - Yes . Give that a little more thought . Zeus ... something 's completely freaked you out . So Buddhist , huh ? Does that mean you shave your head and dance around in robes ? Only at Christmas . Careful , that 's almost a joke . There 's ashes in the trash can . It 's paper , from what I can tell . Old . Maybe parchment . Charring residue indicates it was burned within the last 12 hours . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Could be a combo platter which both kills someone and burns up the evidence . What we call an artifact twofer . There you go . That was funny . That wasn 't a joke . Okay , I give up . You 're joking , you 're not jok- - All right , easy . Easy there , birdie num-num . Look , you 're gonna run into things in this job . Gandhi 's sandals will calm you down so much that your heart will stop beating . There 's a badminton racket that belonged to Charles Dickens . Makes you think you 're an orphan . I put on Abe Lincoln 's hat once and had an uncontrollable urge to free Mrs. Frederic . Don 't think that didn 't get me into trouble . What- - what are you doing ? Did I say that you could drive that thing ? Yeah , that 's the pressing issue here . Something in there has got Zeus panicked . They had identification . That 's the only reason I let ' em in . Hello there . May I ask what y 'all are doing at my crime scene ? Oh , hey , yeah . Uh ... Sorry , we should probably speak to your supervisor . Agent Sally Stukowski , FBI . I 'm in charge of this investigation . Oh , good for you . Agent Pete Lattimer , Secret Service . Agent Jinks , ATF . Really ? Neither one of those agencies is here , to my knowledge . And what is the FBI doing here ? Isn 't this a local police matter ? Oh , I don 't know if you 've heard , but there 's terrorists in the world . So somebody gets poisoned , we like to look into that kind of thing . What are you doing here ? Uh , oh , well , this woman was bitten by a nonexistent Russell 's Viper , and we like to look into that kinda thang , Sally . Oh , you 're funny ... and original . Interference in an FBI investigation is a felony . Is this your first big case ? Get out of my crime scene ! Ha , ha , it is . I knew it ! Congrats . No ... His too . I wasn 't trying to embarrass you . Oh , I 'm not embarrassed . No . What I am is in charge . Boys ... Escort them out of here . Hello , boys . Okay , let 's see how Hera likes these apples . All right ... Okay . She 's burning it right off . Yeah , it had no effect on Zeus either . I don 't know . Think . I 'm gonna go back to the office . I need a crash course in Greek mythology . Hey , Charlie . Somebody sent you a flier . Thanks . Hey , how 'd you ... What the hell is this ? Oh ... Oh , my God ! Help me . Help ! Uh , help me ! Help ... Kai su teknon ? Kai su teknon ? No , no , there wasn 't anyone near him . And I 'm guessing your name 's not " Kay Sue Teknon . " I don 't know why he was calling me that . I thought he was joking around . He was an actor , you know . - The hotel was just his day job . - And what hotel is that ? The Regalton , downtown . Cater-waiter . Poor Charlie . I saw him last year in Anything Goes . He was good . Not great , but good . Okay . Thank you , ma 'am . Forensics says he was stabbed 23 times with 23 different knives . How very Orient Express . Maybe somebody 's got Agatha Christie 's bedroom slippers . And on the floor , more ashes . Agatha Christie 's cigar ? Don 't be ridiculous . Wait ! The first victim was doing a story about bankers meeting at a hotel . - The Regalton Hotel , downtown . - Hey , hey , hey ! Anything Goes . Charlie here was a waiter at the Regalton . - Coincidence ? - Hardly ever . But why waste your best Charles Manson impression on a waiter ? Again ! Why are you here , Lattimer ? Oh , God , why does every hot chick want me ? - Get ' em moved out of here . - Wait . Agent Stukowski , we 're trying to help . Okay , this is weird . Well , we specialize in weird . We can help you . We--we know stuff . All right , but only because I 've got a boss that wants answers yesterday . What do you know ? Quid pro quo . - Depends . - See , you are so cute when you open up . I will shoot you right here . Okay , look , we think there might be something going on down at the Regalton . Both victims were vaguely connected to it . That 's it ? That 's all ? I 'm sorry , you got nothing to trade . So you don 't know anything about a bunch of bankers meeting there ? No . And I think it 's time y 'all got out of here . You 're lying . Agent Jinks , is it ? I 'm under strict orders to sew this up , so that 's exactly what we 're gonna do . Okay , look , I 've got a really bad feeling here , and I would hate for your first time- - Agent Lattimer , my job is to make sure that this event goes off without a hitch . And right now , I already have two . - So there is a connection . - Sew it up . These two out . You are adorable . I don 't think she gets your sense of humor either . Okay , I found it . Are you sure the lightning 's only gonna strike that rod ? Mostly . Listen , listen , listen , listen , listen . The statues of Zeus Hera- - the very ones that we 've got in the warehouse- - those were the very statues that were involved in the Battle of Corpendium ! Now , this is fantastic . Picture the scene . It 's 306 B.C. Yes , you were just a child , but it 's still so vivid . Can you just tell us about the lightning already ? These statues , Zeus and Hera , they hated each other , and here 's why- - Zeus married his sister Hera . Don 't ask . They were Greek . Then Zeus tomcats all over town . Upstairs at Olympus , downstairs with the mortals . Got it . Zeus was a man-slut . Then Hera found out about it . And she made his life miserable . And he hated her for it . Now he throws lightning bolts . God knows what else he 's gonna do . I mean , they 're apart for 2,300 years . Okay , so we need to move one of them- - To a safe place . - We need to do that now . - Yeah . Look , just get us into the shindig tonight . No . No , I 'm sorry , I can 't do that . Look , you don 't want a bunch of dead bankers on your hands , do you ? Agent Stukowski told us that- - Mr. Benjamin Franklin talks a lot louder than Agent Stukowski . What 's that , Ben ? You want to meet the bellman ? Oh , here you go . I gotta start keeping receipts . - Et tu , Brute ? - What ? Kai su teknon . It 's not a name . It 's ancient Greek for et tu , Brute ? From Shakespeare 's Julius Caesar . Right , right . And Antony of Antony and Cleopatra . Ha , ha ! Look at me using my high school English . We need to do some research on those plays , and fast . No , not necessary . I know where we can learn more than we ever wanted to know about Mr. Walter Shakespeare . Ophelia , pray tell . How doth milady ? You 're wasting your time , Pete , okay ? I made my decision , and I don 't work there anymore . I don 't know what you think that you 're doing here . If you could just get your nose out of your own butt for five seconds , I could explain it . I just- - I have some questions . - Well , you could have phone . - Okay , fine . The reason I 'm here is you 're an expert on what I 'm dealing with right now . No , I 'm not , Pete . Okay ? I 'm no longer an expert on things that make you old in two seconds or electrify your spine or- - or create ice-age volcanoes . Okay , now I am just an expert on books . Exactly . Shakespeare . And correct me if I 'm wrong , which I know you love to do , but you 're an expert on the Bird of Avon , right ? Bard . It 's the Bard of Avon , Pete . See , you 're already helping . You know what , just please- - just please , okay ? Come on , Myka . Look , if I had quit and left you there , and you were looking for an artifact about football or porn , I 'd help you . Just try a library , okay ? Man , is it hard to park around here . Hi , can I- - can I help you ? Yeah . This is Steve , my new Myka . Steve , the old Myka . - Oh . - Oh . - Oh . - Right . Myka , hi . Hi . So I take it he 's mentioned me ? No , not really ... We need your help . Fine . What do you need ? - Oh , really , you 'll help him ? - Pete ... - Ah ... - The bodies are piling up . Each of the victims said a Shakespeare line before they died . One said " Kai su teknon . " That 's Greek for et tu , Brute ? Right . Yeah . Uh , and the other one said , " Oh , Antony ... " " Nay , I will take thee too . " - Wow , how did you know that ? - I told you . Well , they 're Cleopatra 's last words before she died . This says that a snakebite was the suspected cause of death ? This pose ? I know . We can 't figure it out either . And there weren 't any snakes anywhere . Definitely not a Russell 's Viper . - The Lost Folio . - The what ? The pose . The positions that the dead people were in . I 've seen it before . I was just looking- - here . Here it is . It 's The Lost Folio . How do you lose a folio ? What 's a folio ? It 's a book . Why not say book ? Because it 's not a book , it 's a folio . Does this look familiar ? It 's Julius Caesar . Hey , hey , hey . He 's in the same position . Well , this--this book is just a reproduction . The original disappeared around 400 years ago . It was supposedly cursed by this actor who desperately wanted to act in Shakespeare 's plays , but Shakespeare never hired him . Apparently he couldn 't remember his lines , so he kept improvising . That 'll piss a writer off . Well , I don 't get the connection . How can a book do anything ? Well , the original was believed to have been cursed by the actor--there were several deaths linked to it . If somebody 's gotten ahold of it , they could be using it . If we could dig up the history of The Lost Folio , maybe we could connect the dots- - Okay . Thank you , kind citizen . And your country thanks you for the loan of this book . - You can 't just take- - - I 'll send you the check . No need for you to get involved any further . Jinksy , let 's go back to Denver . Oh , and , uh ... definitely don 't need any more of your help . Okay , uh ... Well , thanks . I 'm just gonna need the ... Oh , oh , oh . Yes , yes . Here . You know , if it makes a difference , he was lying . Are you talking about Shakespeare ? Because Cromwell destroyed most of the folios . I 've never even heard of a lost one . Hey , how is she ? Does she miss us ? Is she coming back ? I don 't think so . Myka said some crappy actor made it for Shakespeare , then he cursed it , now it kills people . Yeah , I will have an answer for you by the time you get back to Denver . All right , you know how to find us . Kirk out ! Oh , and ... Spock too . Claudia , get over here . We 're in a public place . Claudia , turn it on . Turn it on , Claudia ! Do you think griping at me will enhance my speed ? Just do it . Turn it on . Okay , and that 's it ? Yeah , that 's it . If there 's any problem at all , anybody tries to move him , we 'll hear about it in the office . All right , good . Let 's get out of here . These plants are making me nervous , and that one is staring at me . Okay , so wait . What did Buddha say about happiness again ? That the secret is to want what you have , and not what you don 't have . Yeah , but if I had what I wanted , there 'd be nothing to do . This is gonna be a longer discussion , I think . Okay , so our bad guy takes out a reporter who 's doing a story on a secret bankers ' meeting . That way it stays secret , right ? Nobody gets scared away . But ... then he takes out a waiter . Maybe it gets him access to the event tonight . I think we should- - - Uh-oh . - What ? - I got a bad feeling . - What do you mean ? Vibes . I get these things . Agent Jinks ? This was at the bell desk for you . Who knows that I 'm here ? I 've got a really bad feeling . Hey- - Steve , no ! Steve ! Steve , what 's going on , man ? You can 't breathe ? All right , old on , man . Hold on . Stay with me , man . Hey , hey , you hear me ? You 're gonna be okay , all right ? Stay with me . Hey ! - Pete ! Pete , the folio . - What ? " Commend me to my kind lord : O , farewell . " Make him say it . Make him say it fast . Commend me to my kind lord : O , farewell . Say it , Steve . Commend me to my kind lord ... O , farewell . Congratulations . You were almost killed by an artifact . You are now officially a Warehouse Agent . Oh , son of a bitch . You come after my team ? No . No way . Game on , man . I am- - I am gonna Tesla this guy sterile ! - Pete , lobby . People . - What the hell was that ? Othello . He smothered Desdemona with a pillow . Julius Caesar , Antony and Cleopatra ? Look , I did some digging in the history of The Lost Folio , and listen to this . " The first errant fool that touches the page " shall loos 'th himself in the image therein , " and shall be curs 'd to live the death that is therein depicteth . " - It means- - - No , no , I know what it means . First guy that touches the picture dies that way . It get it , it 's just fancy words make me sleepy . " Yet he who utters the dying breath " may then be spared the errant death . " But breath be spoke before the flame , or death shall take him all the same . " Sleepy , sleepy . The first two victims spoke the last words their character said after the engraving burst into flames . You have to say it before . That 's the only way out . Is there any connection between the victims ? Only this hotel and a bunch of investment bankers who are meeting here later tonight . So you think they 're the targets ? - Well , we don 't know . - Whoa , wait , wait , wait . I 'm sorry , are you back in ? Because , what , you 're just all interested now , so you 're just back in ? No , I 'm just here to help . Oh , well , I 'm sorry , Mykes , but you can 't just waltz in and out like that- - we don 't need a consultant . Oh , don 't you ? 'Cause I 'm pretty sure that if I didn 't get here in time ... Oh , really ? Because if you hadn 't walked out like that in the first place- - It wasn 't the easiest decision that I ever had to make ... Well , I never had any idea- - - Hey ! - What ? I 'm pretty okay with her being back since she just saved my life and all . So maybe you two can work on your repressed sexual tension sometime when we don 't have a book running around trying to suffocate people . Maybe our next step should be to check the tapes and see who left that envelope for me to die from . Yes , we will finish this conversation later . - We 'll do that later . - Oh , man ... It had to have been within the last few hours . We weren 't gone that long . Ugh , if I give that bellman any more money , he 's gonna have to claim me on his tax return . There . That 's the envelope . That guy is dropping it off at the desk . Okay , well , so we 've got a who . We need a why . Create a panic in the financial markets , take advantage ? We gotta get the Wall Street guys to cancel their back-patting ceremony tonight . By telling them what , that Shakespeare 's Lost Folio is gonna kill them ? I know it 's true and I don 't believe it . Plus , we 'll never get Stukowski to agree . Next time she sees him , she 'll have him shot . Oh , I see you 've already worked your magic . Why do you automatically assume it 's my fault ? - Whose fault is it ? - Mine . But we might be able to use uptight Sally to our advantage . But I thought Buddhists were supposed to let go of all worldly possessions . No , it 's about not letting your possessions possess you . See , we believe that you can only lose what you refuse to let go of . You know what , that is so true because I always lose the things I really like , and I never lose the things I don 't care about . Like , my mom would say , " Pete , if your head wasn 't glued to your neck , you 'd probably ... " That 's not the achievement of self awakening the Buddha was talking about . You didn 't know him . Ladies and gentlemen , why don 't we get things started . I 'd like to introduce our panel . I 'm sure some of you know them- - Jim Kouvell , and Doug Alps , from New York . There , that 's him . - You sure ? - Trust me . I got a bad feeling . - Lattimer . - Agent Sally ! I was hoping to run into you tonight . - Save me a dance ? - Boys , please cuff them . - Take them out . - Oh , hey , hey , hey . Aren 't we all on the same team here ? Are we ? 'Cause my team 's job is to make sure the this event goes along smoothly . Whew , man , is it hot in here or is it just you , Sally ? Myka , now ! Oh ! Oh ... Gertrude . " The drink ! The drink ! I am poisoned ! " Say it . The drink ! The drink ! I am poisoned ! Claudius . " Oh , yet defend me friends , I am but hurt . " Say it . Say , " Oh , yet defend me friends ... " - Oh , yet defend me friends ... - " I am but hurt . " I am but hurt . Hamlet . Uh ... Oh , God ... " The rest is silence ! " Damn it , say " The rest is silence ! " The rest is silence ! Bring it ! Bring it ! - Hey , boss ! - Look , fire ! All right , all right ! You guys have had enough . No charge , ladies . Myka ! Thank you . Be careful . ♪ ♪ Well , there she goes again . Found the last pages of The Folio in a room , but the guy was long gone . We know what he looks like , so it 's only a matter of time . Listen , Lattimer , I think you are a first-class jerk , obnoxious , unprofessional to the core . Shouldn 't you be on one knee to do this ? But you were right . So ... Thanks . Oh , and , Lattimer , if you ever fly into the Denver area again , let me know . I 'll have you shot in the airport . It is shocking how much she wants me . Yeah . Oh , yeah , it is . Stud . I am a stud . All quiet on the eastern front ? - Calm and peaceful . - Like a statue should be . Wow ... That 's really ... Annoying . Artie . Thank you . God . Oh ... I 'd forgotten about that . You were so helpful during our recent mission . I just wanted to thank you in person . You 're welcome . I 'm ... glad I could help . Really . There 's someone I want you to speak with . Hello , Myka . Mrs. Frederic , why would you bring her here ? She can 't hurt you , Myka . She can 't hurt anyone . Trust me . I 'll leave you two alone . Myka ... You hate me for what I did . You hate the warehouse for what it did to you . No . No , I don 't . We became friends because we 're alike in many ways . Except that I- - I didn 't want to destroy the world and kill everybody in it . I 'm not proud of what happened , or that it drove you away from the Warehouse . 100 years ago , I went into the bronzer filled with hate . It grew inside me like a cancer . All I thought about was what I 'd lost , what the Warehouse had taken from me , turned me into . Be careful , Myka . Hate so easily turns into fear . Don 't walk away from your truth . That 's why you 're here . I haven 't actually come here . So what , you 're some sort of holographic projection ? I 'm ... being held . I don 't know where or how . They can , it seems , transport my consciousness . Wish I 'd thought of that . Please think about what I 've said . So you 're saying my aura 's changing color .

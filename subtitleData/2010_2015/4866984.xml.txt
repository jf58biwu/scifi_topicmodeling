 I want to see him . Plane 's ready to go . I can handle this , peter . You don 't have to have any part in it . Yeah , I do . It 's awful . Did the police , you know , say anything ? Engine fire or - Accident . Tragic accident . I 'm so sorry for your loss . Excuse me . Aah ! I tried to stop him . I 'm sorry . Stop who ? Hello , samuel . Sylar . Oh , good . You remembered . Get everyone to safety . But not too far . Understand ? Go . You 're just delaying the inevitable . You could have killed doyle . You didn 't . I 'll get to him . I 'm much more interested in you . Memories were a little fuzzy , Like an orange that 's been left out too long , But I could still find my way back . Thank you . - My pleasure . Been a while since my body and mind were together . Be a crisis for a lesser man Having your soul ripped out of you , But not for me . I returned with one simple , singular thought . I know . Wait , don 't tell me . Fun . Feast . Love what you 've done with the place . Brought a lot more people in here . Gonna make me a lot more powerful . No , it makes me more powerful . I got big plans for you . Kill me now , You 'll never know what could be . Everybody has big plans for me . I think that 's all people have . Hey . You all right ? I , uh , wasn 't expecting to see you . Well , I thought I 'd give you a lift . Oh . You don 't want a ride ? I , uh ... I 'd actually prefer if you didn 't come . You lied to me . Once again . About nathan 's death , About what you did . God . It was sylar . Did you ... Forget that it was sylar ? Did you forget what he did to me ? No . He attacked me . He cut open my head . He killed my father . And you , You dressed him up in nathan 's face , And I hugged him . And I felt love for him . We did the wrong thing For the right reason . We found a way to contain sylar And to keep nathan alive at the same time . Claire . It didn 't work . We shouldn 't have done it . You did . And I need time to grieve Without being reminded why . I keep looking up too , Hoping to see him . We never have been very good with death , have we ? Or it 's complications . Can 't have been easy for you , Covering this all up with noah . How are you ? Okay . I 'm okay , mom . Nathan was a better liar . Must have gotten that from you . I 'm sorry . You don 't deserve that . Oh , sure I do . I deserve every ounce of your wrath . No , you don 't . Just want to put my fist through a wall right now . No , you want to put a fist through sylar . What do you want , mom ? Don 't do it . Nathan was right . You need to fight the good fight . Revenge will only get you killed . And I cannot bear to lose you too . Claire 's here . Hey . You , uh , you want to help me in the kitchen ? You trying to escape ? As quickly as possible . Hey , guys , why don 't you take a break ? Thanks . Hey , where 's your dad ? Didn 't see him out there . Uh , I asked him not to come . Ah , you 're pissed . You 're not ? Oh , I am . Good . 'cause you 're about the only person Who 's on the same page as me . That 's a hell of a lie . Trying to protect us . Yeah . That 's fine . I get that , but ... I mean , did they really think That they were gonna get away with it ? Forever ? That we would just never find out ? Ow ! Damn it ! - Let me see . It 's not healing . I have the haitian 's power . I 'll , uh ... Sorry , I 'll turn it off . No , don 't , don 't . - Let me find you a band - aid . - A band - aid . I have not used a band-aid in forever . It 's nice to feel pain . Feel normal . We 're anything but ... Normal . Mourning nathan could not be more ordinary . That 's what we 're here to do . To cut lemons and limes And remember that ... Stupid jerk . I can 't believe he 's gone . Oh , I hope he can find heaven , Because he was a terrible navigator . I mean , for a guy who could fly . Why are you laughing ? What 's so funny ? He gave me endless grief For dating a guy who could fly . He said I had daddy issues , Which I do . Whatever happened to that kid ? What was his name ? West . He goes to n . Y.U. We 're facebook friends . It 's nice telling stories . Makes it a little easier . What about about you ? You must have a million of ' em . I 'm gonna take these out there . Won 't get fooled again . Huh ? i - Hai . Oi , restaurant closed . Everybody get out . Iron maiden ? Seriously ? Just a little nickname That you earned back in the day . It 's a compliment . What are you doing here , noah ? Aren 't you supposed to be at nathan 's wake ? Claire didn 't want me to come . Do you have the sodium thiopental ? You want to talk about this ? There 's just nothing much to talk about . I misled her . She 's angry . I don 't blame her . Maybe if I had followed my gut on this , The whole thing wouldn 't have happened . So the truth serum 's for you ? You 're gonna confess everything to claire ? Not exactly . Do you remember the speedster down in miami ? Carlos , the cuban missile crisis . We couldn 't figure out how to stop him . Well , it turns out that speedsters don 't like the cold . Or quaaludes . But mostly the cold . Tightens their muscles , Slows down their heart , Levels the playing field . Meet edgar . He 's gonna tell me everything he knows about the carnival . Needle ? Why did you put sylar in my trailer ? Because you 're going to help him . He 's not ... Dead ? No . No , he 's amazingly resilient . Muscles knitting back into flesh . But even though all the parts Are back into place , There 's something wrong with him . Well , yeah ... No , not that . He had the chance to end me , And he couldn 't . He 's different . Not the cold-blooded killer , Not the blank slate . Then what ? That 's what you 're gonna find out . And how we can use that To our advantage . How am I supposed to do that ? With your charming personality . I 'm not some piece of flesh You can just toss around . You didn 't seem to mind the last time he was here . Don 't be petulant . It 's ugly . Everyone has to do their share . I know the rules . If you had strength , I 'd put you in construction . If you had the wisdom , You 'd teach the children , But no . These hands were meant for a softer trade - Plying out the demons That haunt men 's souls . Don 't disappoint me . Your skin is so soft . It 's like a baby . What are you doing ? I 'm gonna help figure out what 's wrong with you . There 's nothing wrong with me . I heard differently . You couldn 't kill samuel . Let 's find out why . What are you afraid of ? Mm . You 're lonely . You 're afraid you 're gonna die alone , But you want love . You just don 't think that you deserve it . Do you know what I do to people like you ? You cut open our heads . You steal our powers . You ... See what people want . Their desires . Their hopes . I like it . What are the tattoos for ? A map . How to find what you need . You don 't want to help me . You want to manipulate me To your agenda to kill samuel . I see what you want . I got your power . I don 't need to kill . That 's just something I like to do . Not anymore . You 're impotent . I tried to find a photo of you , but ... There are none . Not of the illegitimate daughter . Nathan wanted to acknowledge you . But you convinced him that it would tarnish his career . I know . I 've heard the story . You 're angry . I 'm disappointed . In you and my dad . I 'm supposed to look up to my elders , Yet I can 't believe a word That comes out of either one of your mouths . Well , I can 't blame you , claire . But you do have a good head on your shoulders . You 've grown into a fine young woman . It 's peter I 'm worried about . Wow . That I actually do believe . He 's empathetic beyond his years , But now it 's his time to grieve , And he has absolutely no idea How to go about it . He needs a shoulder to lean on . Yours . You 're his mother . I am . But , like you , I 'm afraid he will never trust me again . He 'll listen to you , claire . He 's up on the roof , Listening to that police scanner And looking fojustice . Please help him . Go ahead , 55 . We have a 10.3 at 1583 west hudson . Repeat . A 10.3 at 1583 west hudson . I have a barricaded suspect with hostages . Shots fired . No sign of suspect . All units hold back . I 'm alone in here , And I don 't want to execute . 55 standing by . In position outside south corridor . No sign of suspect or hostages . Waiting ... I need you to keep breathing . Just breathe . Claire ? What are you doin ' here ? I followed you . What the hell do you think you 're doing ? Claire . I 'm helping . And so are you . Come here . Give me your hand . Put it right on that . Right there . Don 't move . Claire , this is wendy . - Hey . - Hi . Don 't worry about the blood . Just keep the pressure on , okay ? And don 't move . Wendy , what 'd you say this guy 's name was ? Uh , adam malamut . He got fired , And then he ... He just went crazy . Just relax . I 'll take care of it . Peter , you can 't do this . It 's a little late for that . Peter , wait . Why are you doing this ? Because I need to be more than a band-aid , claire . Wait ! I 'm the one who can 't get hurt by bullets ! Just take a deep breath , In through your nose , Out through your mouth . Try to stay calm . Where 's samuel ? What 's he planning ? What does he want with claire ? I don 't know . I swear . Nice weight . Good balance . Sharp as hell . You make this yourself ? Oh , this is fine work . I 'm impressed . Hey , is this the knife that cut me ? Yeah . Let 's start again . Where 's samuel ? Noah , can I talk to you ? Look , I get that you 're angry . This guy sliced you up like this albacore . That 's toro . And this has nothing to do with revenge . You sure ? Because his face looks an awful lot like revenge . I just want some answers . I know you do , but I can tell you That torture doesn 't work . Look , I might have been the iron maiden back in the day , But I have changed , And you may think that I 'm shoving My liberal agenda down your throat , But you are losing your target . You 're emotional . I 'm not emotional . I just - Worried about claire ? What samuel 's done to her , said to her , And these medieval tactics Aren 't getting you anywhere with either of them . Thanks for the sodium thiopental . Stop using him as a punching bag , And start talking to him . There 's a story you 're not getting here . Try to be objective , Look at the facts of the situation . He doesn 't have a compass . Why doesn 't he have a compass ? Honey tastes sweeter than vinegar . I promise . Who the hell are you ? Don 't worry about her . There you go . You just keep that gun pointed right at me . - You work here ? - No . I 'm just like you . Having a bad day . The worst , in fact . You see , I just buried my brother . He was murdered . And if that 's not bad enough , I had to stage his death . Like I 'm some kind of mobster or spy , but I 'm not . I 'm just some kid from new york city . And now everyone expects me to shake hands And pretend like everything 's normal , But it 's not . It 's far from that . Why are you telling me this , man ? Because I understand where you 're at right now . You want to punish the people that have hurt you . I know what that feels like . I want to torture the guy that murdered my brother . I want to make him scream . That 's all I can think about . But I 'm trying to be hopeful . I 'm trying to be strong , Even though I feel myself slipping . Look , I promised my brother That I 'd be a hero . Don 't make me a liar . Not today . That hurts every time . Well , it 's supposed to . That 's what happens when you take a bullet . I thought I 'd get to him first . I did take him down , though . Yep . You saved the day . It 's your turn now , claire . Come on . Help me out . I don 't think that 's gonna solve anything , is it ? What are you talking about ? Quit messing around . I 'm messing around ? What about you , huh ? Running into danger ? Going off after sylar ? You 're not gonna do anything But get yourself in trouble . You have got to stop . No . You have to . I can 't . I 'm not always gonna be here To be your personal safety net . Then I guess this is a good ability to hang on to . And even if you do , then what ? Huh ? What kind of life is this ? A human pin cushion ? If I keep moving ? If I ... Just act on instinct , Then I don 't have time to think . About nathan ? Nathan would be so pissed at you right now . Lying to yourself , lying to us . You 're not honoring his memory . You 're avoiding it . If I think about it , Then it 's real . If I mourn , Then it 's real . I miss him . I know . Me too . You like tea ? Stupid question . You 're british . Here . Drink up . You must be freezing . Thought the skirt was the good cop . Oh , the skirt is the good cop . Trust me . This is her idea , the two of us talking . If it were up to me , You 'd be down six fingers by now . I spotted you as I came out of my daughter 's dorm . I figure your top speed Is somewhere between 600 , 700 miles an hour ? More ? You could have killed me at any time , Flew past , gutted me ... Blink of an eye . But you want me alive . You need me for something . What is it ? You don 't have a compass . You can 't get home . What are you doing out here ? Exiled . What did you do ? Found out that sammy killed his brother , joseph . He convinced the lot It was my fault . And they just believed him On his say so ? What 's he planning ? What 's he gonna do with them ? Is he recruiting more ? I don 't know . Sammy 's all about saber rattling . He ordered me to kill danko . To slice up your gut . Sorry about that . You don 't seem like a hitman to me . I 'm a juggler . Joseph taught me . Called it the most useful skill a man needs . A juggler ? If you can keep a chainsaw , knife , and torch in the air , You can balance anything . But you 're all out of balance . You 're exiled . You 're lost . Why did you attack me ? Thought if I caught the boogie man And brought you back to samuel , He 'd take me back . You 'd go back to samuel Even after he killed your friend And blamed it on you ? I 'm afraid of what he 's gonna do to my friends . Where he 's gonna lead my family . That makes two of us . We can help each other here , edgar . Enemy of my enemy makes us ... Less antagonistic . We could stop samuel together . Before he has a chance To hurt the people we love the most . You think that tea 's gone cold ? Fresh out of ink . You destroyed the last batch . Then make more . You want a tattoo ? You want to find out Where you 're supposed to go next ? I say you 're already here . I don 't think so . I know why you can 't kill . Lydia told my everything . I doubt she told you everything . You think people are lying , manipulative bastards . They 're just trying to con you . Aren 't you ? You 're hurting . You need a friend . Even though I tried to kill you ? Especially because you tried to kill me . You 're not special . You 're like everyone else . We all need people who understand us . Care for us . Who 's she ? Vanessa . The love of my life . I 'd move mountains for her If she 'd ask me . Haven 't seen her around here . No . She 's out there . I 'm afraid she 'll reject me . For who I am , for what I 've done . That 's the way you think too , That no one could love you . Stop pretending like you know who I am . You have no idea . I know hiro nakamura Said you 're going to die alone And it 's haunting you . I know you . I am you . I 'm not a good guy . But I 'm not all bad , either . I found love and forgiveness and acceptance right here , And you can too . If that 's true , Let the tattoo show me , And I 'll stay . What ? You afraid I might see something else ? I 'm a carny . I live for games of chance . You sure we should have him up here ? Trust begets trust . Never had miso soup before . It 's good . Thank you . No , thank you , edgar . This is invaluable . Now we know what we 're up against . The problem , of course , is finding it . Claire has a compass . - No . - I 'm just saying . I 'm not putting her in the middle of this . You must have a way to get back in . Lydia . She has no great love for samuel . Good . Okay . We 're gonna isolate samuel here , In this backstage area . Quick and targeted . And nobody else gets hurt , right ? Ideally . We 're gonna do everything we can , But this is a raid . When it 's over , I promise you , We will take care of everybody . We 'll find them all homes . They 've got a home . The carnival 's our home . Samuel 's the problem . If they 're wrapped around his finger , He 's gonna use them to protect himself . They 're lambs . They know no better . He 's brainwashed them , edgar . Look what he did to you . He turned you from a juggler into an assassin . Even if we stopped samuel , Can you promise me that somebody else Won 't just take his place ? I know that you think of this as a family , But it has a lot more in common with a cult . Your friends need help . They need to be left alone . Left alone out in the open makes them targets . I have never seen that end well . But by separating them , By reintegrating them into the real world , We can make sure that this doesn 't happen again . What are you doing , edgar ? It was a mistake coming here , trusting you . I won 't let you hurt my family . Okay , edgar , just slow down . You 're not a violent person . No . You are . What 's it doing ? Stop thinking . Stop trying to force it . Just let it happen . Well , isn 't that interesting . I guess you were wrong . I don 't belong here . I like it better up here than down there . I have a lov e - hate relationship with rooftops . You gonna go back tonight ? Yeah . We got school tomorrow . Unless you want me to stay , Which I can . No , I 'm cool . Yeah ? Yeah . I 'm fine . 'cause I 've got to trust you . Can 't have you lying to me . Not you . I 'll always be honest with you . I promise . Strange request . Um , your old boyfriend . West . Could you ... Call him for me ? Yeah . Why ? We had everything we needed to end this , And I blew it . You 're being hard on yourself . I thought the expression was " too hard " on yourself . No , no , I said it right . Still think honey tastes sweet ? I still think it was the right move , yes . Look , I 've seen this before with other cult leaders . Samuel has done a number on edgar . He 's got his hooks in all of them . You mean claire . Yeah , I mean claire . You 're still her father . You 're the only one she has left , And she needs you . You know the thing about burned bridges Is they can be rebuilt . Vanessa . " in the library studying late . Gretchen . " Great . Hello , cheerleader .

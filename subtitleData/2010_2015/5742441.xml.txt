 Clarke , voice-over : I was born in space . I 've never felt the sun on my face Or breathed real air or floated in the water . None of us have . For 3 generations , The ark has kept what 's left of the human race alive , But now our home is dying , and we Are the last hope of mankind . 100 prisoners sent on a desperate mission to the ground . Each of us is here because we broke the law . On the ground , there is no law . All we have to do is survive . But we will be tested , By the earth , by the secrets it hides , And most of all , by each other . Man , voice-over : Previously on " the 100 " ... Man : Prisoner 319 , take off the watch . No . It was my father 's . Mom ? You 're being sent to the ground . Clarke , I 'm sorry I got your father arrested . They didn 't arrest my father , wells . They executed him . Atom , my sister doesn 't leave this camp . Anyone who touches her , they answer to me . Bellamy : Atom . Clarke : Jasper was hit . They took him . Clarke : He 's alive . [ crowd cheering , announcer speaking indistinctly on tv ] Man : There we go . There we go . Feel that ? Feel that ? Here comes the momentum change . Defense . The defense is there . Serve it up . Yeah ! Oh ! Yeah ! Ho ! Man : Right here , kid . They 're unbeatable . Prepare for crushing defeat . It 's not over yet . Actually , it was over 147 years ago . A technicality . No . You 're going down . Your husband and daughter being obnoxious . Wells : Come on , get down the field , fire . ... Time waste . Hey , baby . So , I ran into bennett when I was leaving the clinic And he has that systems analysis that you asked for . Ho-ho-ho-ho ! This isn 't gonna last . Wells : What was that about momentum ? Oh , oh , I feel the momentum . Ok . What ? You 're going now ? Just for a few minutes . Oh , yeah . You know this old boat . It 's always something . [ moaning ] His pulse is 380 . [ moaning ] Man : Go back to sleep ! Second man : Quiet ! Don 't listen to them . You 're gonna make it through this , ok ? [ moaning ] promise . Man : Can he just die already ? I 'm gonna get clean water . Keep an eye on him . [ jasper moaning ] [ man moaning ] Child : No ! Child : No ! Child : No ! No ! Hey , wake up . It 's ok . It 's ok . It 's just a dream . You 're charlotte , right ? I 'm clarke . It 's ok to be scared . Do you want to talk about it ? It 's ... My parents . They were floated and they- - And they seeded my dreams and I just- - I understand . My dad was floated , too . So , how did you end up here ? Well ... We were taking my parents ' things To the redistribution center and ... I kind of lost it . They said I assaulted a guard . I can 't say I blame you . See that bright star up there ? That 's the ark orbiting above us . I think whatever happened up there , You know , the pain ... Maybe we can move past that now . Maybe being on the ground Is our second chance . Do you really believe that ? I 'm trying to . I think this is north . Come on . Really ? Because we just came from that way , Miss I-can-navigate - with-the-stars . It 's your fault we 've been lost for two days . Never should 've gone off by ourselves . Come on . We 'll find the dropship tomorrow . That 's what you said last night . And I 'm hungry . Trina , relax . We 're fine . Did you feel that ? What is that ? I don 't know . I don 't know . Oh ! I can 't see ! Let 's get out of here . Oh , my god , it burns ! Aah ! Aah ! [ both screaming ] [ jasper moaning ] That damn kid , always messing with my head . He 's not gonna last much longer . Better think of a new excuse . That 's how it 's done . We searched a half-mile all directions . No sign of trina or pascal . Visit your special tree when you were out there ? Atom took his punishment . Let it go . Could be grounders . Yeah , or they could be in pound town . Lot of that going around recently . [ jasper moaning ] Look , bellamy , people are scared , And that dying kid , He 's not helping the morale around here . Morale will go up when I find them more food . And what do we say when they ask about trina and pascal ? Now ? Nothing . It 's possible they 're just lost . We 'll keep an eye out for them when we go hunting later . Let 's go kill something . You 're not going . I need you to stay here . If the grounders are circling , We can 't leave this place unprotected . Fine . Somebody better tell goggle boy to keep it shut . The grounders cauterized the wound . Saved his life . Saved his life so they could string him up for live bait . Garden of eden this ain 't . This is infected . He could be septic . Any progress on using the wristbands To contact the ark ? Monty ? That would be a firm no . My mother would know what to do . How 's he doing ? How does it look like he 's doing , wells ? Hey , I 'm just trying to help . [ jasper moaning ] Right . You want to help ? Hold him down . I 'm not gonna like this , am I ? [ jasper moaning ] Hey . I could really use a break from this place . What do you say you and me Take a trip to the butterfly field ? Huh ? Am I being too subtle ? [ scraping ] Atom . [ continues scraping ] Man : ... With weapons What did you do to atom ? Atom 's fine . Then why did he blow me off ? Maybe he 's just not interested . You can 't keep everyone away from me . You disobey me , you pay the price . He paid the price . Now we 're good . Now I 'm paying the price . So , next time you decide to go on , a power trip , Leave me out of it . Jasper : Aah ! [ screaming ] Hold him still . I need to cut away the infected flesh . Stop it ! You 're killing him . She 's trying to save his life . She can 't . We didn 't drag him through miles of woods Just to let him die . Kid 's a goner . If you can 't see that , you 're deluded . He 's making people crazy . Sorry if jasper 's an inconvenience to you , But this isn 't the ark . Down here , every life matters . Take a look at him . He 's a lost cause . Octavia , I 've spent my whole life Watching my mother heal people . If I say there 's hope , there 's hope . This isn 't about hope , it 's about guts . You don 't have the guts to make the hard choices . I do . He 's been like this for 3 days . If he 's not better by tomorrow , I 'll kill him myself . Octavia , let 's go . I 'm staying here . Power-hungry , self-serving jackass . He doesn 't care about anyone but himself . No offense . Yeah . Bellamy is all that . But he also happens to be right . [ door closes ] How 'd it go ? Hey . Well , I told jaha it 's definitive . The ark 's got a year of oxygen left , maybe two . You 'll fix it . Not this time . I 've tried , abby . This isn 't a glitch . It 's a system failure . People need to know . No . They 'll panic . You sound like kane . Because he 's right . No . We can 't avoid the truth . We have to let everyone on the ark Put their minds to a solution . What , and risk anarchy ? No . It 's too dangerous . Promise me that you 'll obey the council 's orders , That you 'll keep it quiet . Promise me . I can 't . For clarke . Do it for clarke . I am doing this for clarke . They 'll float you , jake . If you do this , I won 't be able to stop it . You 're mad . I 'm not mad . You want to think jasper 's a lost cause , go ahead . You 're wrong . I hope I am . Whatever this stuff is , it has to have had Antibiotic properties . Let me take a look . Before you refuse my help , remember Who aced botany in earth skills . The grounders used it as a poultice . I 'm thinking a tea might be even more effective If we can figure out what it is . I know what it is . Seaweed . Right . Well , then there must be a water source nearby . Yeah , it would have to have a slow current , lots of rocks . The water would probably be More red than green . I know just the place . All right . Let 's go . Hey . I know what this stuff looks like . Do you ? You know , you should , uh , Really rethink this whole hating me thing . It 's not just the grounders . We 're surrounded by criminals . We need each other . We 're gonna be friends again . You got my dad killed . Not possible . This is earth , clarke . Anything 's possible . I 'd let it go . Yeah . Well , I 've known clarke her whole life Better than you ever will , so , I 'll decide when to let it go . Yeah , I can tell you guys are close . [ bang ] [ bang bang ] What is it ? Uhh . Ha ! It 's an automobile . Come on , guys . This thing 's been here 100 years . All right ? It can wait . Jasper can 't . [ oinking ] Shh-shh-shh-shh . She 's mine . [ crack ] Man : Get him . Who the hell are you ? Charlotte . I almost killed you . Why aren 't you back at camp ? Well , what with that guy who was dying , I just--I couldn 't listen anymore . There 's grounders out here . It 's too dangerous for a little girl . I 'm not little . Ok , then ... But you can 't hunt without a weapon . Ever killed something before ? Who knows ? Maybe you 're good at it . So , what does this seaweed look like ? [ sigh ] Hey , that thing that bit octavia , How big was it ? Big . We could rig this Into some kind of a net . Find something to lower it into the water . Or we could just do that . [ birds squawking ] Man : Let 's get out of here . [ bellow ] Grounders ? It could be a war cry Or a warning . Finn : What the hell is that ? Run . Run ! Clarke . You 're up . Clarke . Sorry . Well , if your strategy Is to lose really fast , That was a great move . What 's going on ? Nothing . You can talk to me . My dad found a problem with the oxygen system . I 'm not supposed to know . They 've had other malfunctions . They always figure out a way to deal with it . No . This one might not be fixable . The council doesn 't want anyone to know . The council meaning my dad ? Yeah . And my mom and the others . I think he 's gonna go public anyway . Clarke , he can 't . He 'll get floated . I know . But what if he 's right ? Don 't people deserve to know the truth ? You can 't tell your dad I told you . You can 't tell anyone . Your secret 's safe with me . I promise . [ bellow ] clarke , run ! [ bellow ] [ coughing ] [ bellow ] It 's getting inside . Finn : Seal any openings . [ coughing ] [ bellow ] Come on ! There are caves this way . [ bellow ] [ bellow ] [ bellow ] Man : Bellamy ! [ coughing ] bellamy ! [ coughing ] What 's going on ? Air got thick , Everybody 's skin started burning . Monty , my brother 's out there . He 'll be fine . We 'll all be fine . Man : It 's still out there . Clarke : Look , we should just make a run for it . Jasper can 't wait much longer . Us dying in a cloud of acid fog Isn 't gonna help jasper . Is that- - booze . Hooch . Rotgut . Well , careful . Finn , it could be- - Whiskey , I think . Better than the moonshine on agro station . Alcohol 's toxic . This is earth . Everything 's toxic . Plus , it 's a time-honored rite of passage . We 'll pass . Far be it from me to stand in the way of tradition . [ coughs ] [ clarke sighs ] No ! Charlotte , wake up . I 'm sorry . Does it happen often ? [ sigh ] What are you scared of ? You know what ? It doesn 't matter . The only thing that matters is What you do about it . But ... I 'm asleep . Fears are fears . Slay your demons when you 're awake , They won 't be there to get you when you sleep . Yeah , but ... How ? You can 't afford to be weak . Down here , weakness is death , fear is death . Let me see that knife I gave you . Now , when you feel afraid , You hold tight to that knife And you say , " screw you . I 'm not afraid . " Screw you . I 'm not afraid . Screw you . I 'm not afraid . Slay your demons , kid . Then you 'll be able to sleep . It 's been hours . Jasper- - Is in good hands . Octavia will take care of him . While we 're on the subject , Why is it that everyone Thinks me wanting jasper to not die is a bad thing ? Like I 'm such a downer . I can be fun . Yeah . You think I 'm fun . Right ? Oh , yeah . Among other things . You 're fun . You remember that time- - Remember that time you betrayed me And got my father executed ? Yeah , I remember . Where were we ? Fun . Yeah . Well , since you brought it up , And I didn 't , because I don 't want to talk about it , What were you thinking ? I made a mistake , clarke . " I made a mistake , clarke . " Not good enough . You know , I bet You couldn 't wait to run to daddy . Tell him everything So that he 'd finally believe You were the perfect son he always wanted . What do you want me to say ? I want an explanation . I can 't give you one . I thought I could trust him . Well , I thought I could trust my best friend . Guess we were both wrong . I 'm still your friend . No , you 're not . If you were my friend , You would walk out into that fog and never come back . Ok , how about we just ... Take it easy . I have no idea how to do that . [ sniffs ] So , we having fun yet ? [ jasper moaning ] Girl : That kid 's driving me crazy . Boy : Can 't take this much longer . Someone needs to shut that kid up . [ jasper moaning ] That 's it . I 'm ending this . I heard bellamy gave him till tomorrow . Yeah , well , bellamy isn 't here , is he ? The kid 's dying anyway . I 'm just getting it over with . Murphy 's going to kill jasper ! The lock 's on the other side . Don 't let him in ! I 'm gonna kill him , ok ? Let me in ! Let me in , monty ! Uhh ! No rush . I 'm fine here . I got it ! Murphy : Both of you better open up this hatch right now ! Jake : In this time of uncertainty , We will come together as a people . I 'm telling you this because you must know the truth And because I want a future for my child and yours . Be strong . Clarke : You 're gonna disobey the council ? Dad , I know . I heard you and mom . Ok , you know . I 've been thinking about this a long time . The people have a right to know . Your mother doesn 't understand . What 's the plan ? You don 't need to know the plan . You 're making a video , so , what ? You 're gonna break into The communications mainframe ? Making you either suicidal Or incredibly dumb . Wow . You are picking a fine moment To start behaving like a typical teenager . I 'm gonna help you . No . No , clarke , you 're not . But I can- - absolutely not . No . No , baby . You get that stubborn streak from your mother , you know . One of many things I love about both of you . Jake griffin , you 're under arrest for treason . Dad ? Dad ? No , no , no , no . Get your hands off of her . Let me go ! I 'll warn them . I 'll find a way . No , clarke , no , listen to me . Do not--do not do that . Get off of me ! Let me go ! Let me go ! Dad ! Dad ! The fog 's cleared . Come on . Let 's go . Jasper 's waiting . Finn : Last night was pretty intense . You and clarke ever- - No . Not like that . So , help me out . Your best friend tells you something Fairly explosive . You seem like the type of guy That 'd keep it to yourself . You don 't know me . Why 'd you do it ? I don 't know . Why do you care ? You knew what the rules were on the ark . You had to know her dad would get floated . I made a choice . If she hates me for the rest of my life , I made the right choice , And that 's all you have to know . It 's all clear . Anybody out here ? Jones ? Jones : We 're here ! Bellamy : Lost you in the stew . Where 'd you go ? Made it to a cave down there . The hell was that ? I don 't know . Where 's atom ? Trapped in a 100-year-old car by toxic fog . Whew . Last night was pretty ... What 's the word ? Fun . It wasn 't fun . It was irresponsible . We should 've left the second the fog cleared . We 'd never make it back through these woods at night . You were kind of rough on wells . Hardly . He 's a pretty straight-up guy . And he loves you . You know that , right ? But every time your dad comes up , He won 't give you a straight answer . Makes me think he 's hiding something . So , I gotta ask you . How sure are you that Wells is the one who turned in your dad ? 100 % . All right ? He 's the only one I told . Is he the only one who knew ? Girl : Aah ! Who was that ? Aah ! Aah ! Son of a bitch . Atom . Kill me . Kill me . Kill me . [ gasping ] [ atom coughing ] I--can 't--breathe . Don 't be afraid . Go back to camp . Charlotte , you , too . Kill me . Bellamy , please . [ atom coughs ] I heard screams . Bellamy : Charlotte found him . I sent her back to camp . Ok . I 'm gonna help you , all right ? [ humming ] [ indistinct chatter ] Clarke : We 've gotta get to jasper . I 'll need boiled water to make the medicine . Get clarke whatever she needs . I better go get this grave dug . It 's about time . They 're gonna kill jasper . Did you get the medicine ? Yeah . I--I got it . Come on . Let 's go talk . Octavia , just stay there . Please , stay back . Stop . Atom . There 's nothing I could do . Don 't . Oh , oh , please . Don 't . Lose anyone here ? No . Jasper ? I tried to take him out , but your psycho little sister- - Bellamy- - my what ? My what ? Your little sister . Yeah , that 's right . My little sister . Got anything else you want to say about her ? Nothing . Sorry . Get him out of here . Hey , baby . You have to warn them , abby . Oh , jake , stop . Oh , the ark 's dying . There 's no choice . Yes , there is . There 's earth . We 'll at least have a chance . Here . Hang on to that . And ... Give this to clarke and tell her that I- - Clarke , you shouldn 't be here , honey . You don 't want to see this . It 's ok . [ crying ] It 's ok . It 's ok . Here . Keep that for me . Jake , it 's time . [ kiss ] I love you , kid . I love you . Ok . Oh , my god . [ crying ] I 'm so sorry . Sweetheart , it 's not your fault . [ swallows ] I 'm really sorry about atom . I guess we 're gonna have to get used to People dying down here , aren 't we ? But not you . You hear me ? You 're not allowed to die . Clarke : Wells ? I know I probably don 't deserve it , But I need to know the truth . It was my mom . Wasn 't it ? She 's the one who told your dad . I didn 't want to believe it . I- - I couldn 't . I blamed you because my father 's dead And it 's my mother 's fault . Isn 't it ? Wells ... Please . I knew how you would feel . I wanted to- - to protect me . So , you let me hate you . What are friends for ? How can you forgive me ? This is already done . [ crying ] Smooth . [ coughing ] [ swallows ] disgusting . Love it . Can I , uh , get a hit of that ? Let 's start with the soft stuff . Welcome back , buddy . Was that a dream or did I get speared ? You 'll have a very impressive scar to prove it . My savior . Thank you for not dying . I don 't think I could 've taken that today . I 'll try not to die tomorrow , too , If that 's cool . Oh , hello . [ crickets chirping ] Hi . Couldn 't sleep ? I never can . You on watch ? Join me . I had a nightmare . Hmm . I--I have them every night . But ... I think I found a way to make them stop . I 'm sorry . No ! [ groaning ] [ coughing ] [ choking ] Every night , I see him . Your father . He kills my parents and ... And I see his face And ... And I wake up and I see yours . And the nightmare never ends . The only way to make it end was- - Was to slay my demons . I had to . [ humming ]

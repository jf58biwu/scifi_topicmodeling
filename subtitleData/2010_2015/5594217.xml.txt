 Yes , I 'm listening ... fuck . My name 's not " Nehm , " it 's " Nam . " Namgoung Minsoo , shit . Family name Namgoung , first name Minsoo , asshole . For what ? And if I refuse ? You want a toke , asshole ? It 's too good for a shit like you . Wake up ! My daughter , Yona . If I die , she dies too . One gate , two lumps of Kronol . It 's my fault ? Of course , I do it for Kronol . You 've gotta give it to me . We 're approaching . Don 't look . It 's edible ? Gotta train a child , they don 't just know that . I grew up walking over it . This is under the snow on the ground . What is this ? It 's moving . Underground . What is it ? Look , you see that ? What ? You seen this woman before ? She was a maid in the lead car . An Inuit . An Eskimo , actually . She knew everything about ice and snow . She believed she could survive outside . It 's happening . Kronol first ! You blow a fuse or something ? You got a problem with the doors ? Here , smoke a cigarette . You should be grateful . This is the world 's last cigarette . You tail-section hick . Your story is beautiful , Curtis . But I don 't want to open the door . You know what I want ? I want to open a door ... But not this one . That one . One that leads outside . It 's been sealed for eighteen years . Everyone believes that it 's a wall . But it 's a fucking door . Open it and let us out of here . Who knows ? Maybe we can survive . Remember Yekaterina Bridge ? When we got massacred . Every year , I check on it . You can see the wreckage of a plane under the snow . After ten years , the tail had just barely been exposed , but now I can see the fuselage and wings . There 's less and less snow and ice . It 's melting . As snow becomes weaker , it doesn 't take much for everything to collapse . Recently , you know what I saw ? Outside , there was ... forget it . It 's not worth saying . You don 't really think that , do you ? Kronol is , most importantly , a highly flammable chemical . One spark and--boom ! Basically , it 's a fucking bomb . I don 't store it just to get wasted , but to blow this door . Matches , quickly . Give ' em ! Fire ! Blood ! Are you okay ? What 's the matter ? Get down ! Yona . We must open this door . You see these cables ? There are a lot . Die ! Bastard ! Yona . The red one , in slot eight . No , seven ! Yona , the Kronol ! Yona , stop ! No . Put the Kronol on the door . It 's done ! Curtis , the matches . There 's one left .

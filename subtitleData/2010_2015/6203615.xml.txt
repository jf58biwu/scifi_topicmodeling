 Miss Rahme ? That 's enough for today , everyone , Mr. Rauch has a visitor . Armand Rauch ? My name is Sophia Rahme , my mother was Famke Rahme . Her sister studied in Argentina . I think I 'm your niece . Niece ? My girl , look at you . Tell me how did you find me ? It wasn 't easy . At least I 'm here now , Uncle . Or should I say , General ? That 's right , isn 't it ? General Neurath of the SS ? My name is Rauch , Armand Rauch . Do you remember Mathieu Jonas ? Oh , you 'd be safe once he died , right ? But he had a daughter . This .. this was my mother 's . And this .. this was my dad 's And this belonged to the soldier that got him out of the death camp which you ran . I watched them all die looking for you and the others . So every moment of pain you feel right now , is for them . Fucking Jewish slut ! Whore ! The only way you don 't die in this room right now , Is if you give me Klausener . You give me Klausener , and I don 't smother you with a fucking pillow . Such bravado . But still your hands shake . I 'm helpless . Do it ! Typical . You know , there is a reason why all this started . And looking at you now , I realize just what it was . Fine . But you 're too proud not to have kept something . Souvenirs ? Finding Klausener will change nothing . You 're already too late . - You .. you don 't know , do you ? - What are you talking about ? Who is this guy Hunt ? He 's a scientist ? Why are you funding his work in Europe ? Is Klausener there ? Answer me ! Look at you , a child playing detective . The Reich of a Thousand Years has not been hiding from the likes of you . It has simply been waiting in the shadows . Fuck ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! Don 't you fucking dare ! Come on ! Fuck ! Doctor ? Sir , they have arrived . They are onsite . Herr Klausener . EASTERN EUROPE Control , site secured . Extraction team proceeding . There 're shell casings and blood trails that look fresh . No sign of your operative or his team . Approaching the machine room now . Machine room in sight . We should get them out . It is too late , Josef . But the job is done . Smile , Josef . We start it . I 'm sorry , I don 't speak the language . Hey ! Come on ! Look ! I 've got money , just take that , I .. Enough ! Let her go , Marius . - You are a reporter ? - No . - An unfortunate time for a woman . - No , I 'm looking for this guy . I think he was here maybe two weeks ago . Yes , he was here . He met other men , soldiers , not locals , mercenaries . - They went east , they never returned . - East , you say ? But not a place you want to go . You see these families out there ? They come from there . Houses burned , families killed . They talk of horrible things . Yeah , but this Hunt guy , can he have come back by another route ? He didn 't come back .. he 's dead . - You look old . - Gee , thanks . - While you 're there , I 'll have whiskey . - Make it doubles . Well , he 's paying . - My , my ! Hasn 't she grown . - It 's been time . A lot 's happened . Where have you been ? Here and there .. a lot . I heard about Mathieu . I 'm sorry . - A car accident , right ? - Yeah , it was an accident . That 'll explain why Neurath didn 't live to stand trial in Paraguay . - That was an accident . - Right . So , he gives you Hunt , and now you 're here looking for Klausener , huh ? And now I know I 'm on the right track . Hunt 's like you . Searching for your priceless mini-magnets . The unified field theory . - Whatever . - Yes , he was in the same field . - And you don 't want to be . Go home . - Guess that 'll happen . Jesus , Lena , did you listen to anything he said ? This is real . - And this is for all the marbles . - Christ ! Here , take a look . NATO have had a Rapid Reaction Force fighting here in secret for two weeks . Mama ? Shh ! It 'll be .. - Just because some of guys dressed as .. - You don 't understand . Götz , Camp Commandant , testi-fuckered-out in ' 45 . Looking sprightly for a dead guy . Klausener did this ? He really did this ? We 're a long way from old men in rest homes , Lena . - You know where he is ! - Go home ! - Forget it ! - Well I tried . - You 're taking me with you . - No , I 'm not . Klausener 's the last . I get him , this is over for me . Well , good luck with that . It was nice to see you . So .. How did Klausener do this ? They 're like .. ghosts . It 's got a romantic definition , but , actually it 's about a million miles away . Here ! Klausener 's machine . With this on your side you got the perfect army . Theory goes he gave his troops some kind of special treatment . Sounds nice . A treatment combines with a magnetic field that the machine creates , and suddenly , the men aren 't like us . Inside that field they do what they want .. ya know , shoot ' em , see if they care . This picture was taken three weeks ago . Nothing unusual , I mean , it 's pretty , even though it 's Civil War stuff . This is taken two weeks ago , right after Hunt managed to .. This area , this is an electromagnetic field . Vehicles , communications , aircraft .. anything electrical is useless inside it , and it 's sitting right around the area that Klausener was last stationed . This is three days ago . Right now , it 's 30 miles across . Where Götz and his boys coming with it . - Where are they going ? - Everywhere . That 's there deal , right ? The Reich of a Thousand Years . - Okay , here we go . - What ? I got the crew ! Let 's go ! - What 's going on ? - We 're a U.N backed task force , Sir , we believe that illegal chemical weapons have been deployed in this conflict . The civilian population are being warned , They may need to relocate for a brief period for their own safety . Right . - We need to get moving . - Chemical weapons ? Horseshit ! Why give away the greatest secret in the history of science when you can keep it for yourself instead . They couldn 't . Trust me , any governments will pay any price to get Klausener or the machine for themselves . We need to go .. now ! Wait ! What are you gonna do if you get it ? Donate the proceeds to charity ? I went lookin ' for Klausener in Russia , and trusted the wrong guys . Huh ! ? Don 't do time in one of their prisons , they 're cold . About a year in , two guys from the embassy show up . I think they 're gonna get me out .. But once they realized I couldn 't give ' em anything on the machine , they left me to rot . Nobody should control this kind of power . Nobody . I just want Klausener . Klausener 's facility was an underground bunker . And if this map 's right , then it should be about two days travel . Sure , but explain the part where if we 're using my kit and my car , we still need my money ? We 're heading to a militia camp , I got a local contact , a guy called Limak . For the right price , he and a few of his boys will act as guides . - Do you trust him ? - Fuck no ! But I 'm not goin ' in there without some kind of escort . Okay , it 's about another mile down here . There 's a track , turn out to the left . Oh , come on ! Guess we 're there . The field 's expanding much quicker than I thought . Get your stuff . The faster guidance we have , the better . Shit ! That 's the militia camp . That is it , you ready ? Limak ! Limak ! Come on ! Limak .. shit . Hold still , don 't even breathe . We need to get moving . Lena .. Lena , we gotta go . That 's back where we came from . We can call it a day , right now . And the car 's obviously for shit , but on foot , we could be back on the other side of the front line by tomorrow . It 's your call . Special forces . Hello ! It 's an E.M.P. , electromagnetic pulse . It fires a burst of energy that fries anything electrical within a certain radius . Smart . They try to get in close , kill the machine , disable the magnetic field . Can we take it with us ? - Maybe use it when we get to the bunker . - Naw ! It 's fucked . C 'mon ! Gotta keep movin ' . What are these ? They 're runic symbols . Here you go . There was a Nazi special weapon division , they called themselves The Black Sun . They used them everywhere in their documents . I think it 's a code , a password for operating the machine . Oh ! This must 've taken you years . Ten , give or take . At least I had a choice . Mathieu had a choice . - You ever think of doin ' anything else ? - Well , I don 't know . At first I just thought it was every family did . Traveling around South America lookin ' for old guys . And then .. one night , I was maybe .. ten , I sneak into his room . He 's on the balcony crying . And on the bed there are all these .. pictures . Of Klausener and the others , things they 'd done . - I 'd never seen him cry before . - When you get Klausener .. what then ? I don 't know . I have a choice , I guess . There 'll always be somebody else . Somebody who 'll do anything for power , another Klausener . It 's what people do . Yeah , well , the next one won 't be my problem . Go ! It 's evil ! Run ! Come on ! Lena ! Ah , Fuck City ! Stay here . Fuck it , Man ! - Cover the right ! - Cover the left ! Ready , set . Glen .. Road here , walk . Clear out ! - Take cover , take cover ! - Take cover , take cover , take cover . Hold fire ! Hold fire ! I 'm coming out ! - Come on , come on ! - Fire on the EMP . - Do it ! Come on ! - Contact . - Well , come on , what are you waiting for ? - I said do it ! We can 't ! The mission . If we go down , there won 't be a fuckin ' mission , now do it ! That 's right . It 'll be okay . Just stay with me , Mate . - Fuck it ! - Hey ! What ? You wanna fuckin ' say something to me , Mate . Look at that , that 's my Mate . And he died saving your ass . And you 're gonna look like him in about 3 seconds . Hold ! Slow down . What the fuck are you doing here ? This is a restricted area . We are journalists . Really ? Up against the wall ! Spread your fingers ! I 'll take that , Doris . Spread your fuckin ' legs ! Shaw , is it just me , or have we totally fucked this up , eh ? I mean , the physics teacher 's dead . What is it that he said ? It 's all or nothing , Boys ! You only get one chance , - so do not fuck with us . - Look ! We had a fuckin ' choice . Yeah ! Whatever ! They 're both fucked there and so are we . Shut up , Hall . No press credentials , no camera . Still , you remembered you line , Mr. Wallace . What I really want to know is how he recognized you . - I think he thought I was somebody else . - It 's been a day . - Do not fuck me about . - Hey ! - Shoot him and you 'll never know . - It 's a fair point . Hall , take one of her eyes , either 's fine . Okay ! Okay , Wait . I 'm an engineer . You 're a scientist ? I 'm bettin ' a physicist , yeah ? - And what is she ? Your secretary ? - I find war criminals , Nazis . I bet you 're having the fuckin ' time of your life out here , Sweetheart . And you 're lookin ' to get your hands whatever it is they sent you into this rainbow , right ? Oh ! And you 're not ? Come on . Let me guess , You orders are to stop the machine and save the day , then secure and extract whatever Muir thought made it work . One : my orders are none of your business , Sunshine . And two : how did you know his name was Muir ? Fuck ! Talking now would be good . There aren 't many of us who specialize in this stuff . Yeah , so I hear . Which makes this your lucky day . Throw ' im in the wagon , Boys , we just got ourselves a new brain . - No fuckin ' way . - Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait a second ! Am I the only one who remembers that this op went south the second we detonated the fuckin ' EMP thing ? This op isn 't over until I say so . You know what happens if we don 't do something . If that pulse destructed them with a magnetic field .. Yeah . - It 's up ! - Means we can kill ' em ? No , ' cause the EMP had a limited range , that ' why - we had to take it in close remember . - Yeah , he 's right . The device for that yield 's good for , I don 't know , maybe five or six miles at the most . - How far are we from our objective ? - Eight . But for the next 6 miles we can drop ' em . That gives you eight miles to figure out how I gets to complete my mission without that , Mr. Wallace . - You 're in the fuckin ' Army now , Boy ! - Lucky me . Where the fuck do you think you 're going ? - No Ph. D. no ride , sorry . - Fucks sake ! Abandoning a lady in a war zone , classy guy . We 're leaving . Fox formation around this prick . Find somewhere secure . A basement , anywhere underground . With any luck , the cavalry 'll be here inside 24 hours . Remember the route we took in ? Use it . Jesus Christ . Sir .. Roger , Charlie-4 , this is the Control . Okay ! What d 'you got ? Some kind of pulse has been triggered inside the field , Sir . How close to the objective ? - Not close enough , Sir . - Can you tell who it was ? The location puts it close to a way point for Alpha team , - but we can 't be sure . - And what about Beta ? We got a minimal reading about 5 hours ago , but there 's no way it was a full burst . - More like a misfire . - Damn it ! If both your teams are down , General , we need to consider our options . There 's still time . Without a working EMP those teams are useless . - We need to move on . - This is my battlefield . And any nuclear deployment will be my call . We have time and we will wait . Understood ? No , but this isn 't scary , or stupid . Sorry , no Ph. D. no place . Fuck , who should do sitting chin-ups ? Fuckin ' prick . Come ! - Get out of the way . - Fuck ! Where 's my notebook ? No ! Wait , wait , wait ! No , no , wait ! Fuck you , go ! Downstairs ! No ! No .. Nothing . They 've moved on . What did you inject him with ? What was he doing ? I don 't know . Maybe trying ' to turn him into something like them . Nazis , Mate ? Pro fart carts . Yeah . I 'm kinda fucked on knowing much of anything without my notebook - Without the codes and symbols .. - Well , on the bright side , It 's either that or your ball sacks . So you probably ought to resolve that , eh , Mate ? But you remember everything , right ? You had it for years . Yeah , which was a long time . Which is why I had a fuckin ' notebook . You gotta get everything down , right ? Dan , we just lost a fuck lot of time . Find me a shortcut . Oy ! You ! A word ! - What the fuck are you doing here ? - And you 're welcome . - If you give me one second of grief .. - It 's ugly , But if we hustle , we can still get our clock . Clock ? If we don 't complete within our window , Upstairs will assume we failed and order the last option . All 7 kilotons of it . But there are still thousands of people . Yeah , and however millions across Europe if we don 't stop ' em now . We need to be done on time . Our talking isn 't going to save anyone . Wait ! Now SHE 's comin ' ? Chaperones for Hansel and Gretel . Fuckin ' nonsense . - It should be here . - Yeah . Is it me , or did you expect to be visiting this ? - The party moved on . - Yeah , it 's a textbook ambush . Well , either way , those front doors are a fast track to a short career . Flank your moves , find me a back door , you 've got 5 , go ! If it comes to it , then I know the machine , and they don 't . I 'll pull something , if it doesn 't work , you run . And Klausener ? You 're gonna have to deal with him . Everything up ' til now has been the easy part , now the fun begins . When we move , it 's going to be hard and fast , understood ? Yeah . - The area 's clear . - Nothing . There wasn 't a rabbit hole . Carlisle , left ! Hall , right ! Abbott , you move up the middle with me and the girls . Positions at the doors ! Go ! Keep moving ! Move ! - What the fuck happened here ? - Whatever happened , happened . - So ! - We 're looking for cabling , so thick , - We find that , we follow it . - Then what ? With no EMP ? - You need to get me to the Control . - Okay , go ! That 's it . In there . Fuck ! It should be here ! - Fuck your mother . - It 's supposed to be here . Another proud day for military intelligence , that 's what I say . This is .. this .. these .. this is Hunt 's writing . Hey ! Take a look at this . And Klausener ? Since there are even more . Here . Looking at Hunt 's notes , I 'd say they were written by a guy working alone , solving problems . I don 't think Klausener 's been here since this started . Why ? It doesn 't make sense . It looks to me like Klausener sent Hunt .. I don 't know , Klausener wouldn 't .. couldn 't be here . Hunt sets everything in motion .. Klausener 's men go look for Daddy . Hey ! Down there ! Like a cell or something . It is a cell . The engine channeled all of its energy into there , this is where they were created . Always with the right answers . Does any of this tell you where they 've gone ? I mean , where 's the magnetic field coming from if the machine isn 't here ? I don 't know . He 's known to the work of a man long passed sanity , and look at this . Whatever they were doing to Hunt was fuckin ' medieval . Now , it all seems to be about the field and generating power . - I don 't know yet , I 'll get back to you . - No you won 't . Gather as much of this as you can carry , we 're pullin ' out the team . What ! This stuff 's fuckin ' priceless ! All of it ! It 's not a request ! - Ready ? - I can 't just go . In eight hours , right about where you 're standing 's going to be ground zero . If we don 't get going soon , we won 't make it to a minimum safe distance . - Your call . - I really thought I was close . Look .. it took some stones to come here at all . You 'll get it next time . Your man Wallace was right . My orders were to secure the machine and take Klausener in . We make it out .. you and me 'll be good friends . Maybe I can angle a few handshakes your way . So ? Move ! - Let it go ! Let it go ! - Get away ! Get away ! Get the fuck down ! Let it go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Fuck you ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Sam ! Time 's up . We need to be moving . I 'm sorry EZ Company , you 'll need to pull back to that sector . We cannot bring someone out to you . Sir , enemy contact at the defensive lines , one mile east . Well .. that 's it . He could have at least left me a forwarding address . Where would you move it ? Lena , he 's still here . The machine didn 't go anywhere . It 's impossible for it to have gone anywhere , because the machine will always be at the center of the circular field it creates . The rest of this map is fuckin ' trees . Ah , fuck , this is fuckin ' priceless . Well , have a good time looking for your secret chambers , or whatever , Sweetheart . I 'm going to bounce before I 'm settin under a big , fuckin ' mushroom cloud . The op 's not over . Cunningly hidden under the Earth somewhere , along with Elvis and the Easter Fucking Bunny . Yeah , he 's right , we 're done . - My hero . - Fuck . Ya know , others may find this plucky , never-say-die spirit charming but it makes me want to run your head into a fucking wall . Macavoy 's dead , the machine is gone , and this mission is over . You can 't just go , not while there 's still a chance . Really ? And when did you have a say in what we can fucking do , Princess ? Danny , this is for buds . We need to fuck off , right now . And go back to what ? You run now , you may as well keep running , Because they 're not going to stop . Not at the next town , or the next country . The only answer to stopping them is right here . Lena , forget it . Let ' em go . He was right about all of you . Fuck it ! Danny ? Fuck it . Fine . We 're looking for some kind of entrance .. anything unusual . Not as there 's anything that 's usual in there . Don 't forget to leave a trail of breadcrumbs , just in case you get lost . We 'll be practical , just for easy movement . - You really sure about this ? - Yeah . Fuck all . I say we should fin it , if it wasn 't too fucking late . Where 's your right answers , now , huh ? We need to go through this wall . Of course . Is this you having a breakdown ? Is that what this is ? Check for a panel on the other side . This should be up there . Which means it was written when this door was raised and open . There 's one here . Okay . Now that is one well hidden lift . - So , what 's the plan ? - Same as before . You upper his parachute . The moment we 're clear out so I 'd get ' em up in the sky and call for the bird before they extract us and bury us twice . Clear ! ? Now , stay alive , Girls . Nobody 'll believe this story if you 're not here to back me up . I move , you follow . Low and quiet . Do you know how to use one of these ? Wallace .. That way . Oy ! Fuck that ! Come on ! Fuck ! Let me go , you fucking bitch ! Come on ! Come on . Children . Here , this should be the control room . Clear . Do you know what you 're looking for ? Kind of .. a schematic , it 's a .. some plan of the controls . Here . Okay . The machine and containment chambers are through there . Everything routes through here for control . This brings the power in , those distribute it . So , you can do it ? Sure ! It 's like a pressure cooker . We max-out what power the Complex is generating , but we block it routing out . We overload the system . That 's our EMP . No , no .. no , no , no ! Whoa ! Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Not fair , not fair ! - What is it ? - Safety venting . Clever machine . That 's it ! We 're nearly there ! - Whoa ! Fuck it ! Stop doing that ! - Doing what ? The system 's well engineered , it doesn 't want me to kill it . Shit ! You need to go , I gotta stay here with this . But you 're the one that knows the machine . Yeah , and if I leave this , we won 't even get to it , let alone fire an EMP . - So we wait until after it 's fired ? - No , no , no ! We can 't ! We can 't ! If anything goes wrong , we 'll never get out again . Here , if the pulse doesn 't work , try this . There 'll be a dial , keep at it . If not , take a fucking hammer to it .. anything . Go ! Hey ! Watch yourself . Okay ? Alright already ! Come on ! Come on ! God damn it ! Cheap .. - Is that Klausener ? - No , it is Hunt . Come on ! Come on ! Jesus Christ ! Come on ! Sieg Heil , Bitch . God damn it , it didn 't work . Come on , come on . I 'll go and hold ' em off . You stay here and be with the machine . Who are you ? I .. I came to stop Klausener . Disappointing .. only me . Here to kill the machine .. Kill me . Try the electromagnetic pulse . Little girl thinks that I 'm stupid . She 's stupid . She 'll be the one in the core . You must stop the core . Klausener 's secret . Never stop that . Never . - They made you help them . - Expand the field . - Take them to Father . - But I know about you . You 're not like them . You don 't want to help them . Please . Begging is weak , try begging . I 've earned it .. arrogant . Unify the fields , never mind of God . I deserve pain . No pain .. Ah ! Fuck right off . God knows , I understand , Sir , But I 'm out of options , I have to request a nuclear attack commitment . - Sir ! Alpha 's go signal sighted . - Cancel that . Hold all nuclear preparations , but I still want that bunker left . What about these ? Can I use ' em ? - Useless . Klausener 's secret . - Please , I can 't do this ! I don 't know or understand any of it . Two days ago I still thought all of this was about what these people had done . It 's not . It 's only ever been about what they were going to do . Out there , in the world .. The world is vibration particles , nothing more . No , it 's about people . Innocent people dying right now because of what you wanted , and chased and unleashed . And if you don 't help me now , then .. The love of power is the demon of men . The core . The core drives them . But the core has perch . The Black Sun built it . Only they have the key . Congratulations , you 've just been rescued . Where are the others ? Off , through there . Oh , and the flares have gone off , the planes are on the way . How did the flares go off ? It was an accident .. you live , you learn . But we 've got maybe four minutes this place gets chopped into .. Get down ! Get down ! We need to be leaving ! Grenade ! - Come on ! - Right behind you . This is Control Zero . Clear left . Maintain and secure your positions . Clear right . .. control , over . Are you alone ? The jets are coming , we need to go . Hope you 're both decent runners , because this is going to be close , folks . - Worth the trip ? - Yeah . But he didn 't make it . I 'm sorry , Lena .. really . There 's only ever one side in war , your own . - ADOC , this is Dragon .. - Danger close , 200 feet , engage . Proceed , Dragon ! You have a clear shot ! - What 's your status on Falcon ? - We 're approaching the target . God damn it . It 's an honor to meet you , Sir . What do you want ? It 's more what you need .. Isn 't it ? I mean , I kept asking myself , why wasn 't he there . A man who 'd give the world and everything in it to be there when the Reich stood up again . Why wasn 't he there ? And the truth is he couldn 't be , because he 's weak , ' cause he 's dying . Oh , sure ! You might have built yourself another machine , but there was always that one piece .. that you could never replicate . Wasn 't there ? You should never have sent Hunt , though .. too many scruples . You need someone more .. pragmatic . 50 million sounds fair to me . Oh ! And if you were thinking of just .. killing me for it .. then you 'll find that some of the key components are .. elsewhere . You were , weren 't you , you old dog ? Fuck it ! Let 's call it 60 . Easy there , Doc , you wouldn 't want to tear a bag or anything Oop ! Hold on ! We could be in the midst of a bidding war here . You all know how much you like a war , huh ? Hello . Surprise . From beyond the grave .. Well , like you said , they build those places to last . It was nothing personal , Lena . Like I said , I 'm sorry . Uh , huh . - So , is it true ? - What 's that ? That they have more fun . So I guess you were right .. about there always being another Klausener . I had one name on my list , now I 've got two . And I 'm coming for you first . Well , good luck with that , Lena .. I 've got new friends . This is a bigger war now , Little Lady . What if we come after you ? Then I 'll be waiting . Subtext : NoRMITA.326

 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... I love you , little sister , and I am counting on you to fix all of this . You love me , and I love you . It 's simple . It 's just that your life is filled with excitement and danger , and it 's all the things that I don 't want . Good-bye , Pete . " But who was this woman , and why did she ... " Hey , hey , what ? What , what , what , what ? What , are you writing a book ? No . Yes . No , which answer will make you stop asking ? No , no , I think it 's cool . When did you start ? Off and on about a year ago . You 're on page six . More off than on . Hello , hello ? Ugh , come on , Artie , I just sat down . Thank God you 're here . Relax , I 'm not here for you . Steve , Steve , Steve ! What , what , are you okay ? What 's wrong ? There 's a ping for you and Claudia . That 's why you 're yelling like your hair 's on fire ? Whoa , so what , are you benching us or ... Why is that ping not for us ? Yeah . I 'm worried about Claudia . She 's locked up for two days in the warehouse . She 's researching her sister Claire . It 's not healthy . - So you 're trying to distract her . - Yeah , because ... Shush you ! Look , there 's a ping . There 's trouble . There 's artifacts . Go . Go , go , go . Ooh , is that a hoagie ? Oh , I want a hoagie . He 'll get nothing and like it . - Hello , Pete ? - Kelly . Wha ... hey . I 'm sorry to burst in like this , but I 'm in trouble . Oh , my God . Are you ... are we ... am I ... but we were ... oh , my God . You know what , I 'm going to leave you two alone . Myka please , stay . Pete , relax , this isn 't about the baby . It 's not yours . I 'm married . Besides we broke up , like , two years ago . You do know how babies are made , right ? Pete , exhale . Thank you . That 's ... wow , that 's great . Congrats . Listen , I actually need both your help . My grandmother 's TV is possessed . Well , if I can 't temper her outbursts , maybe I should focus on her telekinesis . Claude . I could recreate the music box song and do a brain scan ... Claude . But then she 'd have to be awake and could blow up the building . - Claude ! - Ahh ! Jeez . Don 't sneak up on me like that . I 've been standing here . Well , stand louder . You 're tense . How 's it going ? I want to punch things . Okay , you need a break . We got a ping . What ? No . No , no , no , no . No . I have so much work to do . I 'm on the verge of a major breakthrough here , so ... Oh , really ? What , uh ... what is that ? Well , it 's ... you know . I can ... I can circumvent ... Oh , God , I hate being friends with you . " Charlie Battes , college student . While giving a presentation in class , his spine spontaneously broke in three places . " Did Artie send you ? No , I saw it on CNN . Yes , Artie sent me . Fine , I 'll go , errand boy . But this better be snappy . Oh , yeah , man , I love books . I 'm a big fan of books . As a matter of fact , I got a lot of great ideas for your book . Now , I 'm guessing it 's kind of a spy romance novel with a Sci-Fi bent . Well , do you think we could get some robots in there ? Yeah , Pete , definitely . You know , naked , sexy fembots . Kelly , thank God , just please distract him . So my Nana 's been homebound ever since my grandpa died . Right , and you said that was two years ago ? Yes , I usually come twice a week to bring her food , magazines , and usually she 's in there watching TV , but this morning , I just found this . Ooh , and this is what was on when you found it ? Yes . It 's my Nana 's favorite telenovela , Seducci√≥n Salvaje , " Savage Seduction . " But it was cancelled . It ended last night . Right , not to mention ... I unplugged it when nothing else turned it off , and as you can see , it didn 't work . Where is your Nana now ? I don 't know . I called everybody . I called the police , but they told me I had to wait 24 hours . I can 't . I just know there 's something wrong . - Guys ... - Yeah ? Is that her ? Oh , my God , Nana ? Okay , wait a minute . Are you telling me my Nana 's trapped inside a telenovela ? Apparently . Now , on the upside , it looks like she 's got a pretty good part . She 's playing the part of Dona Fausta Obregon , the wise matriarch of the Obregon dynasty . Is this TV new ? No , she got it over a year ago . And you said that the telenovela ended ? Yes , I mean , my Nana was actually pretty upset about it . You say that it was cancelled , ant 's still on TV . Nothing . This is the series finale . This is where Dona Fausta gets murdered . Oh , my God , does that mean my grandma 's ... - Wait , wait , wait . - No , no , no . Just don 't get too close ... No , Senor Cat ! Or that might happen . Mr. Gato . Now at least we know how she got in there , right ? Right . Now , okay , Kelly , your grandmother , has she bought anything strange or old or kind of maybe an antique ? No , I don 't know . Maybe . I 'll go upstairs and check . Um , Kelly , listen , everything 's going to be okay . I 'm so glad you 're here . What ? No , no , no , no , no , no , no . Oh , no , I 'm not talking about that . Myka , please , she 's married , she 's got a belly out to here . Look , it 's none of my business . I don 't know , can we just please go find some artifacts ? We 're going to find the artifacts . And here we are . I love this car . Could you say that more often ? Because once every two minutes just isn 't enough . No , seriously , how many cars tell you where the campus is , where the best parking spot is ? It even tells me which building we want . Ah , but can it give me a good reason to actually go to college ? Kind of just seems like a waste of four years to me . An education , a job , a career . Got it , got it , and got it , and I didn 't go to college . I 'm also not in debt for the rest of my life . Hey , I 'll be paid up in the next five years . Oh , in that case , sign me up . Yes , you can do an expose on Bill Clinton if you want , but I 'd say you 're late to the party , okay ? Professor Moulton . Yes . Oh , Agent Jinks , I presume . Thanks for meeting with us . This is my partner , Agent Donovan . - Nice to meet you . - Professor . Now , the hospital didn 't have a medical explanation for what happened to Charlie , and we were hoping that you could fill us in . Honestly , I don 't have an explanation either . Mr. Battes was giving a presentation on Gonzo journalism . About five minutes into it , this shadow , is the only word to describe it , came flying in and slammed Charlie against the wall , and then it was gone . Strangest thing I ever saw . Always is . And such a shame . He was a bit of a slacker , but this report was impressive , insightful , even . Couldn 't have been that insightful . The hospital said he had alcohol poisoning . Impossible . I 've had inebriated students . Mr. Battes was stone-cold sober . If you 'll excuse me . Well , yeah , but then senor cat got too close and pzam ! Now he 's on daytime TV . The TV could be a conduit or a portal for the artifact . Okay , but none of granny 's tchotchkes are making any sparks . The artifact could be in there with her . Uh-oh . Pete ... Abuela , no ! Kelly , don 't ! Abuelita , estas bien ? Holy poltergeist . What ? What was that light ? This house is not clean . What ? Speak English ! Artie ... Things just got cray-cray . _ _ - _ - _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ - Hello , Pete ? - Yeah , yeah , yeah , I 'm in here . What 's happening ? Well , I don 't speak Spanish , but Myka 's a super hot maid who hates Kelly , and their waiting for this guy , Armando , who I 'm hoping doesn 't show up 'cause I really want to see these two make out . I meant with the artifact . Oh , right , um , there 's nothing in the house , but grandma got this in the mail yesterday from the telenovela people . - What does it say ? - I don 't know . It 's in Spanish . Give me that . I happen to read Spanish . Dear Mrs. Hernandez , blah , blah , blah ... Really , blah , blah , blah ? What , is that Spanish for " blah , blah , blah " ? " For being such a huge fan , please accept this Obregon brooch that Dona Fausta wore in the show . " A brooch , as in a fancy pin ? A brooch , as in ... that . Ooh , bling ping . Okay , dudes , this is Charlie 's room . Ugh , another temple of higher learning . Ugh , kids today . Kids today are your age . Then they should have better taste . So , Dan , would you say that Charlie was a studier or a partier ? Yeah , definitely . Dude , he wants to study and party , obviously , like everyone . So when was the last time you saw him ? This morning . I don 't know , around 6 : 30 ? Oh , right before Moulton 's class ? I don 't know how he got there . Charlie partied hearty all night , I mean , I bailed at sunrise , he was still barfing off the side of the bridge . Moulton said he was sober and insightful half an hour later . Dude , try barely walking . Okay , but how does a cheap TV prop become an artifact ? Probably was just a cheap TV prop until Kelly 's grandmother got it . Elderly shut-in , lost her husband . Sometimes people fill a void with an obsessive attachment to a TV show . Hey , I watch " Breaking Amish " because I like it , okay ? I can quit anytime . When her telenovela was cancelled , maybe the brooch was imbued with her longing to escape . Yeah , but if she can make a new artifact out of something we know nothing about , then how do we stop it ? By getting in there and neutralizing it before the episode ends and Hortencia dies . Yeah , but , Artie , then we could end up just like Myka and Kelly . I mean , they 're not just playing Maribel and Carmen , they are Maribel and Carmen . These cufflinks , they once belonged to Harvey Korman from the Carol Burnett show . He was famous for never being able to stay in character . As long as you and I each hold one of these , we will stay ourselves . You ready ? Sure . Oh , hey , Artie ? Next week can we go meet honey boo boo ? - Shut up and get in the TV . - Okay . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Congrats . Your Prius found their off-campus study group . This glass is on top of the dust . This window must have been shattered recently , maybe this morning . Well , Dan said Charlie was up there . Oh , you think he fell from the bridge ? Yeah ... Oh , hey . Look at this . Higher education at work . Oh , our guy was a videographer . Hey , Charlie , careful . PPZ rules ! Whoo ! Mihi ardeat lucerna ! That had to hurt . Claude , the way that he hit , that fits the impact that Professor Moulton described when Charlie slammed into the wall . It also explains his broken back . I mean , the goober 's lucky he 's still alive . This video was taken at 7 : 14 A.M. That 's right in the middle of Charlie 's presentation . So he was in two places at once ? Let 's play that again , Sam . Mihi ardeat lucerna ! That 's Latin . It means " my candle burns . " Why would a college kid yell that ? PPZ , that could be Psi Phi Zeta , and the Latin , that could be a fraternity motto . Nice work , Jinksy . Wait , were you in a frat ? Oh , my God , you were in a frat . I bet you were just like hoover . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Armando ! _ Kelly ... _ Ay ! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ - _ - _ _ _ _ _ _ Wha ... wha ... wha ... uh ... _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ - _ - _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ I ain 't never met Charlie . So he isn 't a pledge here . I don 't think so . Why are you lying to us , biff ? It 's Bryce , and I 'm not . Uh-huh , and what about this ? Mihi ardeat lucerna ! That 's your frat motto , I believe . Whatever , just ' cause he knows our motto doesn 't mean he 's pledging . So you don 't mind if we have a look around , then ? It depends what you 're looking for . Hey , pretty lady , what 's up ? Ox , damn it , Ox , get back downstairs . Look , my dad runs the biggest law firm in Minnesota . I know my rights . Get a warrant . Nice guy . Yep , college sure is impressive . Claude , look , isn 't that Ox ? Yeah , Ox just went back downstairs . I want to see what 's down there . Come on . Chug , chug , chug , chug , chug , chug , chug , chug , chug , chug , chug , chug , chug ! Methinks these frat losers have a duplication artifact . Splits you in two . A you that parties hard , and a you that works hard . Chug , chug , chug , chug , chug , chug , chug , chug , chug ! Oh , dude , I think I 'm gonna puke . _ _ _ Dona Fausta ! Dona ... _ Oh ... Uh ... _ _ _ Caramba . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ - _ - _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ - _ - _ _ _ _ - _ - _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Okay , we blend in , we hit the basement , we bag the artifact . That 's a great plan , except that Bryce will recognize our faces . Oh , don 't worry , he won 't be looking at our faces . Nice work , ladies , take five . All right , frat boy , what kind of heathen initiation ritual am I about to walk into here ? I don 't know . My frat wasn 't like this . We had book club and yuletide a cappella . Please forget that I said that . Oh , my God . It just gets better . - I say we follow him . - Oh , yeah . Don 't start without me ! Mihi ardeat lucerna , mihi ardeat ... Okay , they 're not doing yuletide a cappella . _ _ _ _ _ - _ - _ _ _ - _ - _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Aye-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi . - _ - _ _ _ _ _ So can your twin peaks get us in there ? These are only one of my many superpowers . Wait , guys , wait . Watch this . Oh , my God . I am so drunk . You got help me . You 're up , Plebe . Mihi ardeat lucerna . Mihi ardeat lucerna . Mihi ... My candle burns at both ends . It will not last the night . But all my foes and all my friends ... It gives a lovely light . Psi Phi Zeta burn . Psi Phi Zeta bright . Psi Phi Zeta learn . Psi Phi Zeta all night . Hey , what the hell is that , man ? You again . Bryce , you have no idea how dangerous that is . You got to give me that candle . This guy 's an ATF agent . Steve , what happened ? Did you get the artifact ? Was that you screaming ? Oh , honey , I didn 't scream . It was that silly bitch . Oh , grow up . - _ - _ _ _ _ _ _ - _ - _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ - _ - No , no , no , no , no , no . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ - _ - _ _ Ole ! _ _ _ Ay ! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ - _ - _ _ - _ - _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Two Steves , can I just say this is amaze balls ? Actually it 's not . A dangerous artifact is bad enough , but this ... this is rampant underage drinking . Oh , boo hoo , Nancy Drew . We should call the police . Unbunch your panties , will you ? I mean , check out our bestie , the girls are out , and they are looking fabulous . It 's a party . You need to relax your kegel and drown me in a daiquiri , you insufferable bitch ! We need to find this artifact first before you kill me , you irresponsible slut ! Steves , mm , loving you both , you a little bit more , but let 's just split up and find Bryce , okay ? First one to zap a frat boy gets to keep him . Oh , man ! Actually , this is my badge . Where 's Bryce ? Do your parents know that you 're here ? Bryce . Look at my lips . Bryce . I 'm looking for Bryce . Do you know him ? Hey , let me see your driver 's license . My eyes are up here . Bryce . Plucked brow , clean back of the neck , flawless cuticles , you 're gay . No , I 'm not . You 're lying . Bryce . Hey , Bryce ! Steves . Come on , you silly twit . Oh ! Can a girl get a hand ? _ - _ - _ - _ - _ Aye-yi-yi . Ay . No , no ... ay ! Ole ! - _ - Ay ! Myka ! _ _ _ _ - _ - _ - _ - _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Grr . I love it when I 'm butch . No , no , wait . Listen , I 'm innocent . I didn 't do it . Do what , biff , use an artifact to duplicate your frat brothers ? Is that a candle in your pocket , or are you just really into twins ? Tell me about the candle , Bryce . Okay , it belonged to Edna St. Vincent Millay , all right ? Of course . " My candle burns at both ends . " It will not last the night . " O.M.G. What rhymes with " bore me " ? Please don 't call my dad . - Okay , let 's finish this . - Oh , no , no . I 'm just getting started . Damn it , your evil twin sister 's got the candle . _ - _ - _ _ - _ - _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Ole ! _ _ _ _ - _ - _ _ _ Ay ! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ - _ - _ _ _ _ - _ - _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ - _ - _ _ _ _ _ _ - _ - _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ - _ - _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ - _ - _ _ _ _ _ Chug , chug , chug , chug , chug , chug , chug ! Enough . Give me the artifact . Come and get it , lady poopy pants . Twin fight ! Twin fight ! Twin fight ! You are a prude and a nag . You 're a self-obsessed slut . You are the worst gay guy ever . Ow ! _ _ _ _ _ Ole ! Ay ! _ _ _ _ Twin fight ! Twin fight ! Twin fight ! You 're gonna die a lonely old hag . Well , that 's better than a whore in the gutter . Well , it sounds good to me . No way , secret agent girl . I would have done well in school . Oh , curses . How do I fix this ? Ugh , okay , think , think , think . How did it stop before ? Charlie fell off the building , Ox just passed out . Uh ... Twin fight ! Twin fight ! Twin fight ! Hey , Steve . Claudia ? Doll face , W.T.F. ? Sorry , sweetie , you were really fun . See you around sometime . Look out , look out ! - Are you okay ? - I think I 'm gonna throw up . Oh , not on these shoes . Okay . _ - _ - _ _ _ Ole ! _ _ - Dona Fausta ! - No ! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ - _ - _ _ _ _ _ _ _ - Eh ? - Ay ! So any residual effects ? Besides the bruises , the hangover , and your relentless nagging me to call everyone I see a " biatch " ? - Say it again ! Say it again ! - No , stop that . Well , on the upside , I think I 've come up with , like , ten new things to try on Claire next , so ... wait for it ... you were right . Fixing her is going to be a marathon . I needed a break , and I need to pace myself . Oh , and , Steve , I will never let you die a lonely , old hag . Thanks , biatch . Oh , Shante , you stay . - Hey . - Hey . - Artie took off . - Okay . That was weird , right ? Weird artifact weirdness . Let 's never talk about it again . Talk about what ? You know , I 'm just gonna wait for you outside . - Okay . - Okay . - Hey . - Hey . So how 's abuelita ? Oh , she 'll be fine . I 'm going to spend a couple of days with her to make sure she 's okay . But she 's already crazy about a new telenovela , burning love . No ... Ah , well , she 's lucky to have you . I 'm lucky I knew you . - Right . Here we go . - Well , it was great seeing you . - Enough weirdness for one day . - Yeah . Thanks for everything , and , you know , seriously , good luck , Pete , please . We both know it wouldn 't have worked . Why do you say that ? Because you 're in love with Myka . Pete , let 's go . What have you done ? I thought this was settled . What did you do ? Calm down . What are you talking about ? You know what I 'm talking about . - What did you do with Claire ? - Nothing . Why , what happened ? Where 's Claire ? She 's gone . Someone took her .

 TRAVIS : Previously on Continuum ... Kiera ! We can still fight for what we believe in ! I don 't know what that is anymore . My name is Brad Tonkin . And I know why I came back . I volunteered . Agent Warren signed the bodies out yesterday . The bodies are gone ? Cover him . It 's disgusting . ( LOUD INDISTINCT NOISE ) ( GASPS ) ( COUGHING ) ( GASPS FOR BREATH ) Ripped By mstoll ( SOBBING ) For what it 's worth , I don 't agree with this . You 're gonna want to take it slow . ( SOBBING ) No ! ( DOOR OPENS ) I 'm Katherine . The cell keeper . I can 't imagine what you 've been through . No . You can 't . How long ? Months . What 's the last thing ... I remember banging . Death . How ? The technology inside him brought you back . You were ... Merged . Is that not a violation ? I need to talk with him . Not today . You must decide if you 're going to serve . He already knows that outcome . Perhaps . But I need to hear it from you . And you , brother ? I serve here now . ( COUGHING ) ( GASPS ) ( PANTING ) ( GASPS ) You lie , it 'll be more of the same . ( GASPS ) ( PANTING ) You 've known I 've had it all along . What brought on the Gitmo now ? Loose ends . I made a promise to Kiera . I 'm a loose end yet I get to live ? Wow . Well , in that case , how about a few plants in my cage , maybe a Daft Punk poster ? You done ? How many numbers in a GPS address , asshole ? We can discuss your living arrangements later . You hear how she does that ? She says " living , " I hear " burial . " Thank you . Take him back to his cell . Not good enough . Guess that Daft Punk poster 's out of the question now . How much longer does this favor to Cameron last ? We 'll see . It 's not what you think . Garza told me the band split up . You okay ? Apparently we failed . We 've accelerated the very future that we wanted to stop . Corporations are getting stronger , moving out of the reach of legal and governmental oversight , and Sadler has a pretty little bracelet that everyone wants . Well , I would never wear that thing . Came with more warnings than a weight loss prescription and people still wanted it . HALO 'S the beginning of it all , Julian . Corporate control over every aspect of every person 's life . Now , you can help me stop it , without bloodshed . And ... Screw Alec over a little as a bonus . Bring me everything you can on HALO . KIERA : How is he ? Who ? He 's the one you told me about , isn 't he ? The original freelancer who traveled back a thousand years to start your cult ? What do you need ? Alec Sadler . I brought you the wrong one . We 've both devoted ourselves to putting things right in this timeline . But the Alec that 's out there has pressed fast-forward . Technological advances unfolding decades before they should . You want to create a better future , Kiera , I understand . But we 're not here to render judgment . The true timeline is what we 're protecting . Is that what he tells you ? The greatest challenge we face in this work is keeping our personal agendas from intruding into what needs to be done . The Alec out there is dangerous . His path is dark . And what do you suggest ? Let me trade them and I 'll bring you somebody I know that you want . Liber8 ? Better . A soldier from the alternate future Alec created . You give me Alec Sadler , Brad Tonkin is yours . DILLON : It 's evidence . It 's my property , I want it back . Until the case is heard it stays there . ALEC : Great , so , Jason the perpetrator is out , but my property is not and you 're unable to change it . You can see how this doesn 't add up . DILLON : What can I say ? There are rules . I am asking for a favor . Your kingdom to mine . Let me see what I can do . ( SIGHS ) Just get it done , Jack . ( SCOFFS ) Make sure you read these . All right , I think you 're gonna like the direction things are going . We 're talking exponential growth in link backs on Twitter and the usual suspects . Uh , Gizmodo , CNet are rapturous . Rolling Stone is promising a cover and Reddit wants you for an AMA . Julian . Thanks . ( INDISTINCT TALKING ) Servers at Piron ? 16th and 17th floors . I also , uh , thought , uh , these might come in handy . So what 's next ? I 'll figure it out . Okay . In the meantime I can ... You can go home . What 's the point ? You want me to just sit here and watch while my brother takes over the world ? Now you need to leave . No , no , no , no , no . I don 't touch that shit . You selling those ? I 'll pay more than list . Beat it . One more job , Lucas . You should consider trying to draw less attention to yourself . Where 's the fun in that ? Let 's make this quick . You sure it 's happening today ? My intel 's top shelf . They 'll do the heavy lifting and you can piggyback . There you go . What 's your endgame , Curtis ? Believe it or not , he wants you to get what 's coming to you . That doesn 't exactly make me feel better . Come on , help me out . Why are you taking this kind of risk ? He saved me . He showed me ... All you need to know is Katherine isn 't his disciple . She 's his jailer . A great day is coming . Inspector Dillon , sir . Until the case is closed ... The case is closed . Sir . What is it , Cameron ? Liber8 . There 's been a sighting . Travis Verta . And ? Well , we missed him . What is that ? You said they 'd blown apart . We need to press our advantage . I 'm on it . ( BEEPING ) It 's a time device . He 's written code based on liquid chip tech that shouldn 't be available , so , it 's more vulnerable . It creates a rudimentary connection with the brain that grows stronger the longer you wear the bracelet . Now , these blueprints ? The specs on the mainframe that Julian brought ? If we can get to it , it should be easy enough to download a virus . I don 't want people to get hurt . How about we scare the shit out of them ? You 're green . Connecting . We use HALO to hijack the amygdala . Flood the system with fear . The health monitor becomes a health hazard . Will it be enough ? ( BEEPING ) ( SCREAMING ) Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! ( SOBBING ) You , uh , still want to wear that thing ? KIERA : Carlos . Dillon has the time travel device in his office . He assembled it . The freelancers will be here any minute . And this is on me because ... There 's something I have to do . Wish me luck . Good luck , whatever it 's worth . Inspector ? We should talk . I 'm on my way to Piron . I 'll join you . If that 's okay . Suit yourself . Really ? I don 't want any casualties . Yeah , sure . Let 's go get your boy . Let 's . So , big board meeting ? Something like that . I imagine that the perks at Piron are probably better than policing . You think that 's why I got into police work ? The perks ? ( SCOFFS ) I know that 's not why . But I 've seen you change . I 've seen others change around you . So I 'm dragging down a bunch of good men and women because I want to drive a Lexus , is that it ? The signal stopped . But it was here . So much for the back way . That 's a change we didn 't discuss . I thought about it . It 's simpler . I pretend that I 'm bringing you in . Oh , you 're gonna bring me in ? Oh , you think you 're so tough . Oh , now you know I love it when you play rough but um , are those really necessary ? Now you 're my prisoner . Don 't overdo it . Do you even understand the concept of disguise ? All us terrorists look the same . Yours looks good though . TRAVIS : You think Kagame imagined this when he walked in that building and blew himself up ? Liber8 blown apart ? What chance is there for any real change when anyone can go back and tweak events in their favor ? Everyone believes in a do-over . You just press reset and start again . But it 'll never last . There 's a place up north . Remote , people minding their own business . Do you really think that 's us ? Only one way to find out . We 'll always be hunted . I 'm afraid . We can drive north . Figure it out together . I 'll meet you at Lana Lou 's . We 'll talk tonight . Everything we 've seen in the past two years is the new face of warfare . The Internet attacks , bio-weapons . People in power using the rich versus poor divide to push their own agendas . You call that warfare ? Don 't you ? No . The haves versus have-nets isn 't news . It is when 85 people in the world are richer than three billion . You 're the one cozying up to the 85 . Using them ? Yes . Mmm-hmm . What ? Police have always solicited the support of the rich and powerful . Yeah well , I hate to break it to you , Inspector , but we work for the city and all of its citizens . Come on , Carlos . Kissing some corporate ass is what it takes to keep this city safe . Oh , and the HALO smart bracelet , you think that 's perfectly safe ? It 's collecting information . Information that you want to use to track down criminals before they commit crimes . I need help . I need better surveillance . Some of the shit that 's gone down in this city ... What weapons have I got ? Whatever . Yeah , whatever . You 're going to keep busting my balls on this , aren 't you ? You better believe it . Good . Let me just drop this off to Alec , then we can go take a look at the lab . I 'm gonna show you some of this new crowd control technology . It 's the safest thing I 've ever seen . All right . You 're the welcoming committee ? I thought this was a big deal . What the hell ? I told you . I want Alec Sadler . They 're here . All is secure . Where are the others ? ( GRUNTS ) We 're backing out of here . No , we 're not . Yeah . Shit . ( GUNSHOTS ) ( GRUNTING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTS ) Go ! Go ! Ma 'a Salama . I 'll catch up with you . That 's not the plan . I know , we both have things we need to do . Rescuing Alec is what this time needs . Maybe . But I believe in Plan B 's . Way to communicate . It 's like we 're married . How do you like it ? Oh . Had to change my lifting routine when it found a heart murmur . So , hate it , but love it , you know ? Oh , I hear that . Whatever you 're doing , it 's working . Say , do you maybe want to grab a coffee ? I can be downstairs in like five minutes . Yeah . Sure . I 'll get you , uh ... A quadruple Americana . Quadruple Americano . That 's the one ! I was wrong . But we have to move . Just get me out of here and then you can go to hell . Are you coming in ? No . I 'm not . I 'll get a ride back to the precinct . ( GRUNTS ) I believed in you . Yeah , you 're not the only one . You know what this means . I know . ( BOTH GRUNTING ) Sonya . Sonya . Julian . I need to leave . Is there a bomb I should know about ? Not the kind that you think . Sonya , what 's been going on with you ? I 've told you that you 're important and that you 'll do great things , but you don 't seem to believe me . That 's because most of what you say is psychotic . Put it together . Different messengers , same message . Kagame , Travis , Lucas , Garza , me ! Look , we just need to get you out of here . We 're time travelers . And not just us . Kiera and Jason , too . And we all know you as Theseus . Jason called me a murderer . We call you a leader . You are Theseus if you decide to be . I 've seen it in you . I 've seen it in your writings . You are the revolutionary that will resist Alec Sadler . By killing people ? Maybe . Maybe not . There have been so many changes in this timeline . Maybe you will find a peaceful way to lead this revolution , but either way ... ( ELEVATOR BELL DINGS ) Please . Lead it . How many do I kill ? Thousands . It moves past being a monitor to an on-board doctor . Stimulates serotonin when you 're blue , opens up the cortisol floodgates when you 're stressed . What about pacification ? Massive flood of endorphins into the system . Instead Of a riot , you have a hundred people riding a relaxation wave . No harm , no violence . People just have to want to wear it . Did you bring what I asked ? Well , hello . I came in to tell you but actually you might like this better . Number 14 . It 's Sonya Valentine . What 's up , Will ? Sonya . Don 't move . Put your hands up ! Take the shot ! I got this ! Lower your weapons . Put ' em down ! Do it . Do it . Put your hands behind your head . Don 't move . Give me the cuffs . I got this . She 's surrendering . Detective Fonnegra . KIERA : Yes . I got it wrong . I had to figure out which Alec the future needed . You had been erratic . That day I ran into the two of you at Piron , he was bleeding and you seemed crazy . That 's not what you thought when I told you about Sonmanto . Derek Richardson 's trip to Dubai ? That was the other Alec . ( SCOFFS ) I was trying to getaway . Trying to leave town but then you called for help . You always call for help and I always answer . You dragged me here and you left me for dead . Did you see those cages ? Did you notice that they were empty ? Who do you think was next , Kiera ? Me ! You 're not innocent . You have jerked my chain in every timeline I 've been in , ripped me away from my family , dumped me here alone to tell you how to change . And then you took away my chance to get back . And destroyed worlds , Alec . You . That was you . I thought you were getting me out of here . I thought you were a woman of your word . Betrayal is her nature . Did you really think I would leave without him ? You brought him here . ( LASER GUN FIRING ) Don 't move . You can 't go . There 's an order to all of this . And we can 't know it . I only thought we could . If you could just meet The Traveler . Let 's go . Whatever it is you believe , Katherine , I don 't . ( GASPS ) Alec has created a new product . He calls it HALO . He dug the CMR out of dead me to make it work . He 's so far ahead of where we should be , it 's scary . You can let me out here or take me where I 'm going . You might want to secure the attitude , kid . She just saved your ass . Who are you anyhow ? Different timeline . Different future . So , nobody in this car is from now ? I need your phone . I am sorry , Alec . Sorry ? You really have no idea how inadequate that is . Yeah , well , he killed other me and we 're managing . Why stop at just one ? I felt guilty about the first one . What 's your future like ? KIERA : There 's no SadTech . Good . Kellog 's in charge . It 's tribal . Half a dozen different factions . All the tools to destroy life , nothing to sustain it . Not even the will . Maybe Brad 's future starts now because it 's the other Alec and not you . ( PHONE MESSAGE BEEPS ) It 's Carlos . He says he 's worried about Dillon and wants you back at the precinct . I have to go . I 'll drop you off . Urn , I need money for the bus . Where are you going ? Up north . I can get him there . Kiera can meet us later . We can talk . Do what you want , but north 's where I 'm going . ( GRUNTS ) ( SIGHS ) We caught Sonya coming out of Piron . She tried to sabotage the HALO mainframe . I 'm assuming it didn 't work . No , we were on her too fast . You know I had her . She practically surrendered and Dillon was ready to shoot her in the street . You heard ? It 's a coup . Join me . Big day . Feels that way . Can 't win for losing , as you pointed out . There 's no rescue mission this time , Miss Valentine . You know that was the end of us ? A day that should have felt like such a victory . You beat us . KIERA : You beat yourselves . I suppose . There 's an opportunity for you here , you know . You tell us where to find the others and you have my word it will go easier for you . They 're gone , company man . And even if I did know where to find them , do you honestly believe I 'd sell my own people out so easily , just because you did ? You can go . Fight or flight , Protector . They 're both bad choices . You don 't believe that . I believed an idea was greater than love . DILLON : Cameron . SONYA : Don 't wait till it 's too late . You 'll figure it out . Are you prepared for this ? Yeah , yeah . Nora took my statement , other cops , too . Dillon is very powerful , Carlos . This could come back on you . Yeah , well , let it . Can 't watch what he 's doing and let it pass . We 've been known to outsource the incarceration of terrorists , you know ? We just don 't have the facilities here . CSIS , FBI , Canadian and US military . It seems like everybody wants a piece of you . Right now you 're all mine . I imagine that must be quite a thrill for you . What can I say ? I like to accomplish my goals . Catch the big bad terrorist ? Check . Stop her would-be sabotage . Check . Help me find the others . You can be more comfortable than you deserve . You 're still selling that line when there 's no one left in the room but me ? How about you ? I found the other Alec . And it wasn 't exactly a friendly reunion . Maybe I 'll get my own chance to make things right . What did you think you were going to accomplish with this sabotage ? People will wake up . People like their gadgets ! Your entire rebellion is pointless . Not if it inspires someone to resist what you 're doing . What I am doing is making the world a safer place . What 's to resist ? You 're like every general that 's ever tasted power . You want more . And you will destroy what is human in us to get it . I 'm afraid in this case you overestimate me . No , I think I see you very clearly . You 're low-hanging fruit and Alec Sadler has plucked you off the vine to chew you up and spit you out . How long till you spoil completely ? That 's no prison transfer detail . You 're in no position to judge . I 'm in the best position . I find you guilty . ( GRUNTS ) Are you okay ? ( ALARM BEEPING ) ( INDISTINCT TALKING ) ( SIRENS WAILING ) What a goddamn mess . What do we do about Nora ? Have her bury this ? Let the guy go out with some sort of dignity ? I don 't know . I 've got to go . I have to find Alec , figure out which ... Kiera ... It was still in his briefcase . He had a backup plan if the first rendezvous didn 't work out . Kids playing like a couple of professionals . Whereas the two professionals ... Well , we made it this far . Why did you kill me ? It wasn 't personal . ( SCOFFS ) My mission was to kill him . And you walked in . Collateral damage . Chen told me who you are . What you were . Guess I thought I was killing an enemy soldier . Is Alec safe ? He 's your family . He 's my family . Not the family I was trying to get back to . I know . The strange thing ? Aside from all of it , is that if you hadn 't shot me I never would have found you . Kiera Cameron . You are the key . He 's so forgiving . He loves you . EMILY : Good luck . Enjoy this place . You too . Wherever it is that you 're going . I don 't want to know . I don 't believe anything that I do will make a difference in the way that you want . Not in the way I once wanted . I understand , I get it . But what about for now when it 's needed ? Sometimes people make assumptions on their basic hypotheses that are wrong . You thought that I was the problem . I thought that I was the problem . But ... But it was me . Problem . Solution . Who knows ? Be careful , Alec . You too . Viewers tipped a million last night , Mr. Sadler . You picked up your tilt-rotor yet ? You hear about Sonya ? Dead . I heard . Down a board member , too . Too soon . Sorry . You were fond of him , I know . Now , would you like to see this picture ? I went old school with this , for the privacy . That was yesterday . Seems the woman has changed her mind . She is a heartbreaker . Ripped By mstoll

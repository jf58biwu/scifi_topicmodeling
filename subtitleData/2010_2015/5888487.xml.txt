 Previously on Pioneer One . You are holding one or more of our cosmonauts . So you 're not prepared to consider the Mars story at all . If we maintain our position that we are holding a terror suspect , we should be okay . We 're not gonna find out what 's really going on here if we send him back as a terrorist . - And how can you make that call ? - Because I 'm the one making it . Parents . Have you stopped to consider why they would risk sending their only child back to Earth ? - I need evidence , proof . - They need you to star talking . Sharing information helps , that 's how science works ! Unfortunately it 's not how governments work . You can 't call me here . If I need anything else I 'll call you . It 's not enough . So what ? That 's it ? I 'll include it with my final report but I wouldn 't get your hopes up . Why not ? They 've already decided what they believe . All the evidence is right there . All it takes to see it ... is a little imagination . You know , there 's one thing I didn 't include in the report . Probably the best piece of evidence there is . The boy . Pioneer One 1x05 Is that you ? It 's both of us . I 'm not using that shower again . My foot is still killing me . Maybe it 's infected . I put that stuff on it . What stuff ? I don 't know , whatever stuff was in there . Don 't worry , you still got the other foot . How are you in such a good mood ? I 'm barely holding on to what 's left of my sanity . It 's a state of mind , my friend . Mind over matter . - Mind over matter ? - Yeah . Just , I don 't know , pretend you 're ... at summer camp . - You ever been to summer camp ? - No . Well , than that wouldn 't work for you No . Wonder what that 's about . I don 't know ... They never tell me anything . I 'm sure we 'll find out soon enough . Any twos ? Go fish . What happened ? We caught him snooping around the perimeter . Someone from our fan club outside ? I don 't think so . Says his name is Aleksei Chertov . Russian I think by the sound of his accent . He claims to know Dr. Walzer . Really ? So he says . Walzer 's name is all over the press . He could just be a nut . I agree . Let me see him . I 'm Tom Taylor . I 'd like to know what you were doing sneaking around my base . My name is Aleksei Chertov . I am a colleague of Dr. Walzer 's . I need to speak with him . Who 's Dr. Walzer ? I know he is here . I saw on the news . I 'll consider it after you 've given us your full cooperation . I understand . But first may I ask that you remove these restraints ? I am not a dangerous man . You were caught trying to break into a military base that 's under quarantine . You 're staying put for right now . Why do you need to speak with to Walzer ? I believe I can be of assistance to him and to you . Who says we need assistance ? I have information you will find useful . Regarding ? The Soviet spacecraft that has returned from Mars . Aleksei ? He 's here ? So you do know him ? Yes , yes , yes I do . He worked on the Mars program at Energia , Russia 's equivalent of JPL . We met at a conference twelve , thirteen years ago . He wrote the foreword to one of my books . He says he has information on our Martian situation . Any idea how he knows about that ? No ... Can I see him ? I haven 't decided yet . - What 's the harm if he 's already here ? - I haven 't decided that either . - Taylor ... - Doctor . I understand we haven 't had the best working relationship but don 't talk to me like I 'm stupid . How does he know ? You 're right . I apologize . I contacted him a few days ago to get a second opinion on some things . But I didn 't tell him what was going on . - He figured it out on his own . - How ? Apparently the spacecraft was transmitting telemetry and someone picked it up . Once he heard I was here ... Did you know he was coming ? I told him not to . Thank you for your honesty . You ever lie to me again and your next book will be written from inside a Federal penitentiary . Get me ? Yes . Now can I see him ? How are you , Dave ? Not bad , yourself ? Never a dull moment . Quite a coup your guy pulled off . Yeah ... yeah , that was a surprise . Though the difference is semantic , really . Please ... When 's he running ? Who says he 's running for something ? Okay , sure . Fine . The Secretary is focusing all his attention on the current situation . Spoken like the master obfuscator you are . I 'll take that as a compliment . What have you got for me ? - Who 's that ? - I have no idea . Aleksei . - You sure about this ? - Nope . I told you not to come . Yes , I am sorry . But the possibility of a human being returned from Mars ... I could not stay away . I 'd probably have done the same thing . You said you had information . Yes . As I explained before , the capsule was sending its telemetry data and was picked up by a receiver at Baikonur . Nobody knew what it was . Nobody knew what it was ? No , we knew it was one of our spacecraft but no one knew anything of this mission . - How 's that possible ? - I don 't know . Many things were worked on in secret in those times but the magnitude of such an undertaking ... it seems impossible . But I did some investigation and found curious omissions in records . Money and resources diverted and unaccounted for . I made inquiries but no one could answer . Well we 're talking , what ? Thirty years ago ? It could be anything . It 's not uncommon for the Soviets to have mysterious omissions on the records , but of this size ? - That 's very unusual . - Could they even hide something that big ? I don 't know . Can I talk to you ? Jane says Yuri will be ready to talk when he wakes up . I want you in there to translate if he starts up in Russian . What about Jane ? She doesn 't speak as well as you do . And anyway , I want a second person in the room to confirm what he says . - You don 't trust her ? - It 's not about trust . I just want someone to be there who doesn 't share her relationship with the kid . What about these two ? - I don 't want them left alone . - Yeah , agreed . Get DiLeo or Vernon to babysit , they 're not doing anything anyway . - Which one do you want ? - Flip a coin . These people . Do you trust them ? Yes . But it 's their show . They 've made that very clear . Zachary . I must know . Do you believe ? Is it real ? I think so . I thought you were lunch . I 've got something better . Than lunch ? I think we have some workable intel here . Have you ever heard of an organization called White Wolf Elite ? That 's a Russian agency isn 't it ? It is , but it 's not part of the Russian government . It 's a private security firm . They helped round out the force that invaded Georgia a couple years ago . - Okay ... - It was founded by a man named Viktor Klimenko . Ex-KGB . Ex-KGB , now there 's a nice idea . True enough . After ' 91 he was one of the first to put a claim on the collectivized oil fields and made billions . And now he 's in the army-for-hire business ? He founded White Wolf in 2000 after he became disillusioned with the direction of the new Russia . It 's now the second-largest private army in the world , second only to Blackwater . How disillusioned was he with the new Russia ? Very . But this is why we care . A few years ago , White Wolf bought up surplus hardware from the Russian Space Agency . Rockets , capsules , a whole lot of materiel . So you 're saying ... our favorite Martian is a White Wolf guy ? Not necessarily . But it 's a good bet that 's where the capsule came from . Any ties to known terrorist organizations or rogue states ? No . But they 're mercenaries . They 'll sell to whoever can pay . This Klimenko sounds like a patriot . He wouldn 't back someone if it didn 't further his own interests . So we just got to figure out what they are . He 's also a business man . I wouldn 't rule it out . You got this from your man at CIA ? Even the Agency finds a nut every now and then . Okay . He says he 's ready , but don 't push him . Please . You know who I am ? Jane said you 've agreed to answer some of our questions . I feel like I should read him Miranda . Can we start with your name ? Your name . Yuri . That 's what we 've been calling you . Is that actually your name or are you misunderstanding me ? Name ... Yuri . Okay . We 'll come back to that one . Where do you come from ? Where is home ? Under a different sky . You had a note with you . It said you were ... from Mars . Is that where you come from ? - I don 't believe you . - Mr. Taylor ... Believe ? Is not about ... believe . What is it about ? " Home is what you carry in your heart . " You had a gun with you . Do you understand ? A gun ? To shoot things ? Why did you have a gun ? For the wolves . I don 't understand . - He said the gun ... - I heard what he said . The wolves ... outside . They tell me . Who told you ? Your parents ? Where are they ? Why ... why didn 't they come with you ? Why didn 't they come with you ? Mr. Taylor , please . Why didn 't your parents come with you ? Not enough ... for everyone . Goddammit ! It 's like talking to a fortune cookie . There 's still time . You really think we 're going to get anything useful from him ? At least now it 's clear to everyone we 're not dealing with a terrorist . It 'd be a lot easier if we were . Easier on who ? We 'll try again . Utopia Planitia ? Barren . North Polar Cap ? Good chance for water maybe , but they 'd never survive the winter They 'd have moved underground . They would have to wherever they are . Eos Chasma ? Good shelter from dust storms . And solar radiation , yes , but ... Too soft and unstable for a landing here , right ... I wouldn 't rule it out though . I 'm telling you , foothills of Syria Planum . Protected , maybe buried water , it is only sensible . I can 't believe we 'd miss them in Syria Planum . That 's area 's been mapped down to the square meter . We 'd have seen something there by now if that 's where they were . Underground , my friend , underground . I can 't believe they 'd be able to dig out an underground habitat . Do you have any idea the weight requirements for a drill that size ? Natural caverns , the drilling could be minimal . And you do not know what equipment they had . You really think they could have developed a whole new generation of super-heavy-lifters without anyone knowing about it ? - Unlikely . - Multiple launches ... with smaller boosters . - Yeah ... - Making use of existing technology - is the only viable way ... - I have read your books ! - Then you know I 'm right ! - Of course I do . - Then why are we arguing ? - Who 's arguing , Zachary ? You can be a real sonofabitch sometimes , you know that ? Yes , this I know too . You 'll have to forgive us , Mr. Vernon . My father is Mr. Vernon . Call me Glenn . It must sound to you like we speak another language . What are you doing exactly ? Well , this is water ... taken from inside the capsule . This gas chromatograph will show us the deuterium hydrogen ratio to determine whether or not it has come from Mars . We 've known since the 70s that the D to H ratio on Mars is different from Earth 's . Mars has a completely different chemical history . And , hopefully , this ... herovina will demonstrate this . If it 's not contaminated . Yeah , but , as you say ... is worth a shot . And if we can prove that this water came from Mars ... Then maintaining life on the surface would be possible . More than possible . Where there 's water ... there is potential for life . It would certainly change the game . There 's even some evidence that water still flows on the surface during the summer season . Speaking of water flowing . Nature calls , gentlemen . Zachary . The boy . - Yuri ? - Yeah , have you spoken with him ? He 's only just started talking . What is he like ? Small . Frightened . Of course . The ordeal ! Can you imagine ? I have . Many times . When can I see him ? I don 't know if that 's possible , Aleksei . You didn 't make a very good impression showing up the way you did . But I am here now . What harm can I do ? That 's not how these people think . I 'll talk to Taylor . Absolutely not . - I know it was a mistake . - You think ? I 'm sorry if it made things inconvenient for you Inconvenient ? I don 't think you understand that word . I realize the position I put you in . I don 't think you do . This thing is so much bigger than what you think . No , it 's bigger than you think . Please , I have had it up to here with your bullshit . Maybe you wouldn 't have such a huge chip on your shoulder if you learned how to work with people instead of talking down to them all the time . - You 're right . - Don 't forget that I 'm the one who brought you here in the first place and that I 'm the one that ... what did you say ? You 're right . Is this a reverse psychology thing ? Why do you think I 'm not still married ? Did you talk to Yuri ? - Yes . - What did he say ? Nothing very useful . But I think you might be right about the parents . Why they sent him alone . Let me talk to him . I spent time with him , I think I can engage him . There are only four days left in the quarantine ... and who knows what happens to Yuri then . We don 't have a lot of time . What is there to lose ? I 'm sorry it 's taken so long to meet in person , Minister . Please , no need to stand on ceremony . Call me Pierre . Pierre . And before we begin , I believe congratulations are in order . Congratulations ? For ... ? Your promotion . Oh , yes ... thank you . And I wanted to thank you and the Prime Minister for your patience with us during all this . The press hasn 't been so kind to you . Please . The next week they 'll have forgotten the whole thing . Probably . Anyhow ... Did you get a chance to look over those documents we sent you ? It 's fascinating reading ... but I 'm afraid I don 't see the relevance . Don 't see the relevance ? It 's relevant because there 's a likely connection between this White Wolf ... - and the downed capsule . - Supposition . It 's the best lead we 've had . We need to follow up on it . It 's a tenuous connection at best . Almost two weeks of investigation ... has revealed no evidence of foul play . The Russians have given us their full cooperation . This White Wolf is a private entity . If they were conducting an operation or doing so on behalf of somebody else , do you honestly believe the Russians would admit to it ? There is no reason not to take them at their word . At their word ? That this guy is some long-lost cosmonaut from outer space ? This space nonsense was your pretense for this whole quarantine . But that doesn 't matter right now . You can investigate whatever you like of course . But the Russians have requested the return of their man at the end of the quarantine and we intend to turn him over . Unacceptable . He 's our only link to whoever 's behind this . And we 're not giving him up . Make no mistake . My visit is a courtesy . Call the White House . This quarantine is over . Come , my friend . You are about to witness one of the most important discoveries in all of history . He 's not kidding . What are you looking for ? Elevated levels of deuterium . Heavy hydrogen . Any moment now ... What ? Inconclusive . It was a long shot . So the water 's not from Mars ? It still could be . But we just can 't tell for sure . At least not with the equipment you have here . Have you checked inside the reentry capsule for traces of regolith ? The pressure suit was covered in dirt but it was contaminated at the crash site . Doctor Walzer . They 're ready for you . Hello Yuri . Remember me ? Yes . How are you feeling ? I 'm dead ... here . I 'm sorry . They 're ... We 're doing everything we can . Ask questions . There was water ... in your capsule , How did you find your water ? From the pit . The pit ? Everything ... - from the Pit . - You mean ... From the ground ? From under the ground ? Water under the ground ? It lives ... in the pit . Lives ? What lives ? Was there life there ? Water ... brings life . How did you live ... on the surface ? Inside ? Inside under the ground ? Live ... inside . Always inside . Outside is danger . Yes . Outside is dangerous . Did ... did you come here on purpose ? To this place ? Did ... Did you crash here on purpose ... or by accident ? - Accident . - By accident . It didn 't separate . Yes , yes , that 's right , the capsule didn 't separate , the whole thing came down . He had to choose . Choose ? What did you have to choose ? What did you choose ? Choose how to live . I don 't understand , what ... what does that mean ? I don 't understand what you mean . Yuri . Explain to me what you mean . Yuri . Something 's wrong . For years , years , I have said that radiation is the primary danger . You were saying it 's acceptable risk . Do you see now ? There are ways to mitigate the effects of radiation on the surface . This doesn 't that mean living there longterm is impossible . And what of solar flares in transit ? You are always talking go go go . Look what happens . I didn 't send him there Aleksei . He 's dying . What does it matter now ? Do they know when we 'll be able to talk again ? Give us the room , please . Before we went in there I was on the phone with McClellan . He 's ending the quarantine early . - When ? - Tomorrow morning . The Canadians want to turn Yuri over when the clock runs out but McClellan doesn 't want that to happen . Tonight we 're going to load him onto a truck and slip out of here as quietly as possible . Assuming he lives that long . Has this been sanctioned ? He says it comes direct from the White House . Well , that 's it then . That 's it . What do you need me to do ? Figure out who needs to know , get them up to speed . Don 't let Benton get wind of anything . Don 't worry . I know how to handle Benton . Thank you Sophie . Those things 'll kill you you know . Thanks for the tip . I 'll never understand why people still do that . The science has been around for fifty years ... people don 't listen . Science isn 't everything , doctor . You don 't believe smoking will kill you ? No , I 'm saying that dying isn 't necessarily the worst thing that can happen to somebody . Tell that to that kid in there . Did you want something ? I ... guess I wanted to thank you . For allowing me to see this . I 'm not gonna be able to tell anybody , am I ? Probably not , no . It 's not really fair , is it ? He comes all this way ... beating appropriately astronomical odds ... The kid could have been telling you exactly what you wanted to hear in there , Did you consider that ? You saw him in that bed . I did . What possible reason could he have to lie ? I don 't know . You look me in the eye and you tell me right now that you don 't believe he 's really from Mars . I thought I might find you here . Here I am . I ... I know you were being close with him . I 'm sorry . It 's okay , I 'm fine . I don 't really know what I 'm trying to say , but I 'm ... I 'm sorry . I work with cancer patients . I know how this goes . I 'm really fine . Alright ... Do you know what they 're going to do with him ? No . No they never tell me anything until it 's about to happen . I 'm going to stay with him though . For as long as they 'll let me . DiLeo ... Something 's up . I think she likes you . Yeah ... Okay , you all know by know that the quarantine is ending tomorrow . But I 've made a decision and I thought all of you should know . Tomorrow morning , we 're going to hold a press conference , and at that press conference ... we 're gonna to tell the world what 's really been going on here the last two weeks . What are we telling them , exactly ? That we have evidence that the Soviet Union may have sent people to Mars in the 1980s , and that we have recovered one of those people . We 're going to lay out everything we know and let the world decide for themselves . Vernon , I need you to call all your contacts , call everyone you know , get as many people in here tomorrow morning as possible . DiLeo , I need you to work with Dr. Walzer on language for a statement . Can we have the room , please ? - No ! - Sophie ... - Tom , no ! - I 've made up my mind . You can 't do this . Your career will be over . - If I had a nickel for every time I 've ... - No kidding ! You can 't do this ! We have instructions from the White House . McClellan 's scaring them into this . Really ? Were you in the room for that meeting were you ? You know what 's going on here . It 's politics they don 't want to look weak in an election year . Are you really going to get up there in front of the whole world and tell them that we have a real live Martian in here ? I 'm going to tell them what we know . From there it 's out of our hands . Look . I know ... you 've been ... frustrated . But this is a mistake . I 'm telling you you are making a mistake . I don 't think so . You must be happy . Happy ? Happy 's not the word . Tomorrow everything changes . You think so ? For better or for worse . I 'll be with you in a second . I 'm in the mess . There are events that become pivot points in history . We had no idea what was going to happen . And we had no idea the price we 'd pay . We just did what we thought was right at the time . And I would do it all again . Even knowing the consequences .

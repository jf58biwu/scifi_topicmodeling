 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Quickly , we don 't have much time . Besides that , the De-bronze functions activated twice . Who 's our mystery guest ? Where were you exactly ? I was at the Warehouse . You don 't remember . You 've been having lapses . How do you know that ? The pearl of wisdom . MacPherson must have planted it in your inner ear weeks ago . If a person uses it properly , they can control your thoughts and movements . Shipped in from D.C. what about my stuff ? Sorry , slick . If you don 't mind , I 'm watching a movie , and I don 't have Tivo . No way . Does this mean I 'm an Agent now ? No , it means I can reach you any time of day or night . Okay . Not as good . These are the reason . Hello , Irene . Mr. Valda , nice to see you again . If MacPherson is out there- - he 's out there , and he 's planning something far worse than any of you can imagine . I know what the plan is . I 'll tell you everything . James ? James ! I 'm sorry , Arthur . Mrs. Frederic , you told me to let you know if I--I experienced anything strange . Secret Service . Find General Williams . Tell him Buck Mendell from Warehouse 13 is here . I have full authority to shut down the Farnsworth demonstration now . Thank you for coming . Why are these out ? Claudia pulled them to learn more about her new toy . She just wanted to spruce up her her far- - Right . Um , I 'll lock them back up as soon as you leave . Edgy . Unfocused . And the headaches ? It 's all right . Mr. Valda knows you 've been through an ordeal . Why am I having these headaches ? When MacPherson was part of your consciousness , he may have left something behind . An echo . This is Taka . She 's here to help us find out . I mean , I have , like , over 5,000 cds . You don 't have 5,000 cds . I do ! Good morning . Here--ooh , I 'm sorry . Can I help you there ? There you go . No , no , no . You 're welcome . That 's- - have a nice day . Yep , they still hate us . Why ? Maybe it 's your cologne . Well , I 'm not wearing any . Oh . That 's so funny . You 're hilarious . Look , making connections with strangers is never easy . Just relax . It 'll happen . Hit the brakes , slick . The Post Office is closed . Closed ? Yes . It 's 10 : 00 in the morning . Government cutbacks . Everything was sold off or shipped out . Wait , wait , wait . What about my stuff ? I was supposed to come pick up my stuff this morning . Try the branch in Featherhead . Well , Featherhead is 90 miles away . Take a bus . Read a book . Now wait--wait- - wait a minute , lady . Look , I 'm in forced retirement . Going to make popcorn and watch movies on cable , 'cause that 's all I can afford to do on my government pension . What 's left of it , anyways . Thanks . What ? " Thanks " ? Thanks for what ? Why do you people all hate us ? Okay . Relax , okay ? Just call the branch in Featherhead . Okay , Farnsworth , let 's pimp you out . Claudia , where are the schematics to the bronze section ? Got Farnsworth gak ? What the hell are you doing ? You gave it to me . You 're tampering with perfection . Those are Warehouse issue . These things need color , GPS , texting , and email is what they need . Need ? They don 't need ! They have their own secure frequency spectrum . They can 't be cracked , hacked , tapped or- - well , can I at least give it a better ringtone ? Oh , just give it a better ringtone ? Yeah . No ! You know what you can give it ? You can give it back . No , no , no , no , no . Well then , button it up and learn to live with it . Fine . Living with it . You see what happens ? Yeah , so if you could call me back , I would appreciate it . Thank you . Featherhead voicemail ? One for Post Office , two for hunting licenses , three for county maintenance . So I guess they 'll either find my stuff or pump my septic tank . Oh , great . Now this thing 's on the fritz . Okay , let 's go for a drive , shall we ? Yeah . I hear the middle of nowhere is beautiful this time of year . Ow ! Come on , men . Let 's kill what needs killin and go home . Hang on . We 're not gonna die today , you understand me ? Other guys are gonna die . A lot of ' em Tojo 's boys . But not us . Not if I can help it . Follow me , boys . It wasn 't me . It wasn 't me . It wasn 't me . There 's something wrong in town . Why does Artie want us to meet him here ? I don 't know . You know , it was a terrible connection , and all I heard was " barber shop " and " emergency . " Maybe his eyebrows are finally eating his face . Uhh ! How on earth did you get a driver 's license ? Can you drive a stick shift ? No . Then take a lesson . Oh , you 're a menace ! Well , in a good way . Artie , my Farnsworth is making weird noises . You see what you did ? What ? You busted my Farnsworth ? No ! Now , who is a menace ? I only messed with mine . Well , that 's the bad news . What ? What was that ? That is an alarm system . If there 's an artifact in town , then that would turn purple , and it turned purple . This town has artifacts ? Not normally , no . But over the centuries , towns that host Warehouses have been given , well , certain kinds of protection , just in case . And given recent events , an artifact may have been placed here to distract us from more , well , pressing pursuits . MacPherson . H.G. Wells . Part of the plan ? Maybe . We 'll see . First of all , let 's get the artifact . I want you to question the townies , find out if anything particularly unusual has happened , then snag , bag , and tag . So you want us to go door to door ? We have a standard cover in Univille . They think we 're IRS agents ? And they think the Warehouse is an IRS storage facility that contains every U.S. tax return ever filed . No wonder they hate us . We 're tax collectors . I hate us . Oh , you even have their tax returns . Sure . Like that 's a big stretch . Okay , so while we 're dodging tomatoes , what are you gonna do ? S.I.S. Salinger inventory scan . If an artifact is AWOL , the S.I.S. will I.D. It . Salinger , like the author ? RTFM , dude . " RTFM " ? Oh , read the f ... manual . I like that . Mr. Valda , I don 't think employing the pearl of wisdom is our wisest move . You know better than I the consequences that can come from using artifacts . Speed is of the essence . You 're looking for trouble . I 'm looking for clarity . Irene , if something is buried deep inside Leena 's subconscious , if MacPherson has left a residue that could help us understand what we 're facing , then we must dig it out . And we risk a woman 's life . To save many . Mrs. Frederic , it 's all right . After all that 's happened , I want to do this . Leena . Thank you . And if something should go wrong ? Taka will make it right . Marines . You saw Marines ? Yes , but like from World War II . Probably some guys playing dress-up like civil war nuts . Mm-hmm . Were they locals ? I 've never seen them before . Did you catch any of their names ? Was there anything distinctive on their uniforms ? No . Yes ! A patch . A wolf 's head . Uh , how do you know they were Marines ? My grandfather was a Marine . N--oh , ' cause so was I. Really ? Yes . My grandfather ... Hmm ? He was an evil bastard who emotionally tortured his children . Okay . Look , what does this have to do with my taxes ? Well , um , if they were a profit-based ... If there was any kind of profiting Based group of war re-enactors ... If they 're acting about war ... Then we would have to bring in some ... You mentioned seeing a flash of light . This town has power problems . Transformers blow all the time . Sparks and brownouts . Nothing ever gets fixed . We lost our Post Office . I mean , how do you guys justify warehousing old tax returns when we 're losing essential government services ? I mean , you guys are useless . Hey , wait- - wait a minute , lady . Now you may not know this , but we 're out there every day , trying to save your butt . Maybe today even . Saving my butt ? Yeah , that 's right . I 'm still waiting for my Bush tax credit . Who 's your supervisor ? I want a name . Oh , I 'm sorry . Here , let me spell it out for you . U-n-c-l-e s-a- - Uncle Sam . He 's patriotic and he can spell . Isn 't he cute ? Well , uh , my apologies . Seriously , Kelly , you have no idea . It 's Dr. Hernandez . Whatever . Uh , thank you for your time . Hello . Customer . I have a special ... Order . I was just working on a project that needs unworking . Can I get the name ? Claudia Donovan . It 's old copper wire . Um , a 20th century blend . Two-inch flange , one traverse . Um , and some old Mallory capacitors . Also , um , some half-watt 180k ohm Bradley resistors . And you have no idea what I 'm talking about , do you ? I heard " wire . " Uh , let me check the file . " Donovan , " you said ? I.R.S. , huh ? Oh . Um , yeah . Mm-hmm . I 'll just have a look around . So I just moved here . Why on earth would you do that ? Yeah . Kind of a long story . Uh , th--that 's the owner 's apartment . He doesn 't like people to go up there . He 's kind of private . Oh ! Wow , that 's loud . I know , right ? Excuse me . I can 't find anything under that name , but ... Uh , is everything okay ? No ! The " R " is for " Revenue " ! There 's no need for language like that . Sheesh ! Strike 11 . All right , so no one else has seen anything . Maybe there 's not an artifact . You know , maybe Kelly the vet is one kitten short of a litter . Okay , William Siminski , lucky number 12 , right across the street . Yeah . Uh , you know what ? If Claudia broke this- - did you see that ? See that ? And we both see that . Afternoon , Jake . Never thought I 'd see you in my town again . Hey , he looks familiar . More re-enactors ? This town belongs to me . That 's where you 're wrong , Jake . The only thing belong to you after this day is a coffin . Now that 's a good line . Holy crap . Was that for real ? Well , it seemed like it a second ago . Were you hit ? No . But I think my underwear is shot . ♪ Warehouse 13 2x03 ♪ Beyond Our Control Original Air Date on July 20 , 2010 Guys , I think I might be onto something . Sunspot activity and shifts in the Earth 's mag field spanning 80 years , from the Wild West to World War II , might have actually left trace bioelectric- - What ? At 10 : 30 this morning , you futzed with the Farnsworths . Also at 10 : 30 , a town vet saw Marines . And every even since then has started with Farnsworths squawking . I fixed them . They 're fine . What about MacPherson or Wells stealing an artifact and hiding it in town ? Dude , what 's up with your S.I.S. ? We scanned three times , Claudia . Nothing is missing . Well , it 's not me . Artie , there 's not enough power between these Farnsworths to twitch a frog 's leg . Until you started mucking with intricate circuitry . Okay , okay , okay . What if it 's not the Farnsworths ? Thank you . Just if , and if it 's not , then it 's still possible that there 's an artifact in town that 's generating some sort of power that 's causing this , or it 's drawing from another source . Theoretically . All right , theoretically if it 's not the Farnsworths , then we triangulate from the Marines , from the horses , from the cowboys , and it 's somewhere , theoretically , in this area . That 's , like , four square blocks , Artie . Well , four square blocks we can focus on instead of , you know , running all around town . Artie , can you please run another S.I.S. scan ? I suppose . Okay . And we will go back to " UN " - iville and hit these four square blocks hard . I thought it was " You " - niville . " UN " - iville . Unincorporated town . Let 's just get out of here before this thing escalates . Escalates how ? " Dangerously " comes to mind . The amber acts as a governor controlling the pearl , which allows Taka to travel with it . There will be less pain than before , but a little . Let 's get it over with . Fascinating . Leena ? Yes . Let 's see what 's in there . Yo , Artie call you ? Yeah , a huge power drain at the hardware store . So what 's the layout ? Two-story , one employee . A new guy named Todd . Owner 's out of town , and when I went for the stairs , Todd warned me off . Bet whatever 's sapping power is up there . Okay , so let 's go around back . You stay here , keep an eye out . Oh ! You think these things are still under warranty ? Yeah , I doubt it covers acts of Claudia . Just watch out for another light show . What the hell ? Aah ! Holy mackerel . Oh , dude . Dude ! Dude ! Oh . I 'm so sorry . Hmm . Uh , don 't move . Hey , guys ? Guys , there 's something- - Okay . Qu 'est-Ce Que c 'est ? Todd 's boss is a video pirate . Selling illegal satellite feeds to the good folks of Univille . This is the artifact ? No , no , this is a felony . My Farnsworth barked . Something 's coming . I think it 's here , downstairs . Something spooked Todd . Oh ! What did you do ? That thing you showed me . The--you know , the arm thing , maybe the leg thing . I don 't know . It just happened . Whoa . That 's a tiger . Yep . Forgive me , brother . And that--that 's a gladiator . O--okay . Not ghosts . Time travel ? Spartacus . Here , boy . To the Gods , we are beasts that dance to their tune . Not anymore . I 've heard this speech before . It is better to die a man , fighting for your freedom , than to die a slave , fighting for their pleasure . Hey , weren 't you just a cowboy ? Hey , be careful ! Pete ! Okay , I think it 's real now . Pete , get out of the way ! Get out of here , guys , now ! Pete , no ! Aagghh ! Pete ! Pete , no ! Aagghh ! What happened ? A gladiator just kicked your ass . Oh , good . For a second there , I thought a gladiator just kicked my ass . No ! Enough , Mr. Valda . You 're chasing shadows . Something is throwing those shadows . Can you go deeper ? There 's some risk . Then go carefully . Wait ! Irene . I must be certain she survives . Taka is- - Taka is out of her depth . I am not . Lattimer and Bering , right ? They 're so raw , so untrained , so corruptible . James , are you there ? Why is H.G. Wells here ? What does she want ? Mrs. Frederic , you must tell me your secret . I can 't remember anything . Not much to remember . You fell of a ladder and banged your head . Dropped your glasses . You really work for the IRS ? Actually , I work for a top secret organization that tracks down mysterious and powerful artifacts . You 're gonna audit me , aren 't you ? Maybe . Ow ! Baby . Sadist ! Hey , maybe you can give him something , for , you know , the pain ? Aspirin . I think I saw some rolling around in my glove compartment . Oh , well , maybe if I was a dog you 'd be nice to me . What is with you two ? Man hater . Right . Okay , okay , so the gladiator is the cowboy is the marine . Yeah . According to the description given by Dr. Bow-Wow . So maybe we 're looking for the medallion of the village people . I don 't know . Hey , you took the transmitter course at Rowley ? Sure . Okay . Do you remember the section on identifying aggressive frequencies ? Ah , here 's a surprise . I don 't . Okay . We know that these things go off before something happens , right ? So , what ? We think they 're causing it now ? No , I don 't think they 're transmitting anything , but- - but maybe they 're reacting to the signal , picking it up before it becomes a gladiator or whatever . And maybe Claudia can turn them from reacting devices into locating devices . Oh , God . What 'd I do now ? I knew we had a Farnsworth aisle . Yes , which is off-limits to you , so , off--off-limits , which means , do not touch a thing . You just tell me what you need to rig these two into signal locators , and I will get it . I. Okay ? Got it . Okay , I need that . Oh , okay . And that . This ? And , uh , those . That 's awfully vague , Claudia . Those two right there . Those . I 've got it now . I have it now . Ooh , and let me get a- - no , no , no , no ! Oh , no , Claudia , no . See , Farnsworth dabbled in nuclear fusion , and some of the things on this side of the aisle , they 're still kicking . Still kicking ? Mm-hmm . You see what you find out when you include the old guy ? Huh ? What , are you having a stroke ? You know what ? Touch it . Go ahead . Touch it all . Okay . MacPherson could have buried an artifact and repaved the road . Well , maybe Claudia 's tweaked Farnsworths will help . I hate maps . I thought men loved maps , you know ? So they don 't have to ask for directions when they get lost . Well , you don 't get to ask directions in basic training . How long were you a Marine ? You 're always a Marine . But I never wore a patch . Wait . Kelly said they wore a wolf patch , right ? Yeah . Well , Marines don 't wear patches . Oh , man , come on . Come on ! What ? Wait ! All righty . Good to go . Huh ? Good to go where ? Oh , uh , right . Do you want me to drive you ? God , no . Give me the keys . Oh , uh , by the way , there 's weirdness with item 186 in the Farnsworth aisle . Weirdness ? What weirdness ? Well , original manifest listed two parts to item 186 snagged in 1944 , but there 's only one part on the shelf : 186-B . Jus--just- - where 's 186-A ? I mean , if it was missing , then S.I.S. would have pinged . And what does that half of the artifact do ? Manifest doesn 't say , but inventory records show 186-A was never shelved . Never ? So it was never here ? It must have been down on the loading dock for 70 years . Do we have a loading dock ? Fire . The wolf was spitting fire . Yeah . You better stay inside for a while , just to be safe . Safe ? I mean , what 's going on ? Look , Kelly- - Dr. Hernandez . Dr. Hernandez , please , stay inside , lock your door . Fire-spitting wolf patch ? I mean , explain . Operation Dragon Wolf . It played in heavy rotation on the 3 : 30 movie back in Ohio . I must have watched it , like , 100 times . The lead Marine was played by an actor named Raymond St. James . These are movies ? Well , they 're Raymond st . James movies . He also played a few cowboys and a gladiator too . 1944 . All right . So , 1944 . You 're here somewhere . Project Gemini . Philo , you broadcasting madman . Buck Mendell ? Buck Mendell . " Transmutationaldelivery device . Project Gemini army field test prototype . " Philo ! A transmutational camera to a receiving projector . Philo , what happened ? It wasn 't , and then it was . It was what ? Real . A projector camera . 186-A . 186-B . 186-A never made it here . It didn 't even get here . So , what ? The shipping label tore off ? 186-B , 186-B . 186 . 186-B . Three-dimensional camera , check . 3-D projector , lost in the mail . All right , I 'm not promising anything . Okay , so what do we hope happens ? Well , the screen should display a tapering arrow , okay ? The narrow end should point to the signal 's origin . That 's the source of the transmissions . What about the other end ? That 's where trouble 's likely to show up . Since the movies are getting more violent and more real , we 'll want to avoid that . Ooh , hot damn . All right . Well , I guess the source is this way and the problem 's that way . Okay . More violent ? Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . If the problem 's that way , Kelly 's is that way . Well ... Kelly , I need you to open the door . You told me to keep it locked . I know , but I need you to open it now . Will you make up your mind ? Would you please just open the damn door ? God , what is with this chick ? Look , I need you to get out of here . It 's dangerous . It 's back this way . I don 't see anything . What kind of IRS agents are you ? Rocky , scram ! They 're onto us ! Claudia , get her out of here ! Pete , we should go too ! There 's too many of them ! No , no , we 're okay . I know this movie , Dark Memento . After they shoot him , the bad guys take off . Rocky , listen . No one 's gonna know what happened here tonight . You gotta be my mouthpiece , see ? Oh , he 's about to die . This is a great scene . Well , can 't we change it ? I know , you don 't do it for them . No , it 's no good . This thing 's on rails . Just stay out of the way and we won 't get hurt . You do it 'cause it 's the right thing . That 's why we got into this lousy racket . This--this , uh , this- - this film festival 's chronological . Operation Dragon Wolf , Showdown at Laramie , Sword of the Gladiator- - Not his best work . The next one is Dr. Doomsday . Now get out there . Save the girl . Oh ! " Save the girl . " Yeah ! Okay , okay , so what happens in Dr. Doomsday ? Oh , really fun movie . He plays a mad scientist who blows up an entire town . Probably less fun if we all , you know , die . So item 186 went dead letter ? What exactly is item 186 ? Well , 186-B is a camera in the Warehouse . 186-A is a transmutational delivery device . It 's supposed to transmit 3-D holographic images to the enemy , convince them that you 're a lot closer and better equipped than they thought . It worked , but ... Too well . It blew up in something called " Project Gemini " in 1944 . Somehow light and matter coalesced and a 3-D projected Sherman tank became solid enough to shell the crowd . How is that even possible ? You 're still asking that question ? I 'm still hoping for an answer . Oh , dude , you 're picking a lock . Can I do it ? No . But it 's been so long . Not long enough . Come on . Anyway , all I know is that the projector never got to the Warehouse . I think that we can assume that it made it this far . And somehow it 's broadcasting the Raymond St. James Festival playing on movie classics unlimited . Oh , I love that channel . I know , right ? Okay , since " how " isn 't on the menu , do we have any idea " why " ? I don 't know . Uh , signal flux , sunspots , uh ... Intruding ... Wave diffraction ... On the signal ? Yeah , maybe . All I know is , there 's a pattern to the randomness . I just don 't know what it is yet . Hey , guys , since we 're here , can you keep an eye out for my stuff ? Oh , would you give that a rest , dude ? Hey , guys , over here . 186-A . The label 's torn . Yep . Stokes county , South Dakota . Enough to get it to the Post Office but no further . Do you remember what she said ? Yeah , " gonna eat some popcorn , watch some movies . " And who is " she " ? Soon they 'll know my power . We 'll return to the Raymond St. James marathon in just a moment . Don 't go away . Dr. Doomsday is about to rock your world . Yeah . Better than a flat screen . Hit the brakes , slick . " The darkness , the emptiness , that it 's all for nothing . " MacPherson is still there . No . It 's him , but not him . Deep in her subconscious . Like grooves cut in vinyl . " You are the most unpredictable woman . " You must eradicate them . Smooth them over . Or she can go mad . " I 'd seen the truth . I 'm sorry , Arthur . " Mrs. Frederic ? Am I all right ? Yes . I believe you are now . I didn 't do anything wrong . Wait till you get your government pension check . You 'll take stuff home too . Oh , yeah ? Well , you stole the wrong package , lady . Okay , if the projector isn 't plugged into the wall , then how is it being powered ? It 's internal . Regenerative power ... Source , the same as the ... Farnsworths . Broadcasting on the same spectrum ? Mm-hmm , more than likely . Ooh , ooh , ooh ! The movie 's back on . Rest easy , my metal friend . Your labors are at an end . Doomsday 's got a killer robot . I went as that robot for Halloween . Really ? Was it recently ? Best candy haul ever . The universe wants to be set free . And he 's got the bomb . Why don 't we just cut the connection from the projector to the television ? Does anyone have any better ideas ? ... Humiliated or forced to stand by and watch men with puny minds steal my secrets . As for imitators ... Check . Solid core activator . Microwave . Intruding wave diffraction on the signal . Wait , is that what 's kicking Raymond St. James out into the street ? Make a lot of popcorn , do you ? Well , how else do you watch a movie ? Turn it back on . I want to see how it ends . Yeah , well , you may have to live it , because we can 't shut down every microwave and satellite dish in the state . Doomsday is here . So , around here , right ? Yeah , it 's- - that 's what it says . Where ? I don 't know . Maybe it 's just a false alarm . They thought I was mad ! " Mad ! Now they shall all know my true genius ! " It 's not about cocktail parties and politics . This thing is somehow buffering the input , and I think it 's just gonna play the movie out , and then , when Dr. Doomsday hits that button , boom ! Kaboom ! 186-B . We 've got the camera . Why don 't we just- - interrupt this irregularly scheduled broadcast- - by filming something benign- - and projecting our own drive-in movie . It 's in my car . We can set it up in my Camino . In whose Camino ? No , no . How long do we have ? Well , he 's got about a three-minute monologue coming up , and then ... There is going to be an awful lot of life ... It looks like things are about to reach an explosive end after these words from the folks that pay the bills . Stay tuned . Well , we 've got an extra three minutes . Well , unless someone fast-forwards through the commercials . Don 't even joke about that . Claudia ? Ow ! Claudia , wait ! I got the parts you ordered . It 's not a question of madness . Okay , considering that the town 's about to blow , we should probably use our guns . Just sayin ' . Good point . Stay clear of the robot . He kills by crushing . Got it . Okay . Seriously ? Right . I forgot about the magnets . What ? But the one constant through all of this ... How 's this thing work ? Well , just find something that looks like an " on " button and let 's hope that the projector accepts the transmission . Now , focus on something benign . Not me ! I haven 't been benign since 1956 . Okay . Wait . What ? Why--why--why does the robot have your guns ? Well , he kind of just reached down and took them . All right , all right , all right ! Just--you can sit this one out . Artie ! What ? It 's fried ! Oh , no . The misfire in 1944 must have- - can you- - ? Wait . Give me your Farnsworths ! Your Farnsworths , right now ! I can cannibalize these for parts . No , we 're gonna need five Farnsworths to fix this damage . We 're totally screwed . I am going to destroy that glue . Here comes his big speech ! Do you guys really work for the IRS ? What is that ? The parts you ordered . Found ' em . You 're a wonder twin ! Here . Got it . Hey , hey , hey , you guys , hurry up . There 's only 15 more lines before kablooey ! Resistor . Now would be nice . Resistor . Thank you . My reach extends far beyond this realm . I will destroy everyone you love . Uh-oh . Wha--wha--what 's- - what 's the matter ? Why " uh-oh " ? Artie , he changed his signature ! Meaning what , exactly ? It 's a totally different layout . I 'd have to reverse it . Aaghh ! I need the Farnsworth blueprints . No , no , they 're locked in tech . But I was just taking a gander at them back at Leena 's . Well , I 've got ' em- - well , here . I mean , I read them this morning . Photographic memory ? Me too . Who is this guy ? Later . Farnsworth . Okay , imagine five of these , okay ? Staggered diagonally , this section right here inverted , so how do I- - ? You put that one there , and then you run- - you run this to there . Right , right . 'Cause that would connect those two . Brilliant . Death takes many forms . I have created a few more myself , but then- - uh-oh . What 's the matter ? I need a fusible link ! I don 't have a fusible link ! What 's fusible ? Maybe I have one . The car battery ! If you intended to make your life better- - yours , what then ? Hurry up , guys ! Are they to be removed , erased , eradicated ? Yes . Yes , of course . Okay , he 's almost out of dialogue ! It 's the countdown ! Oh , that 's it ! Here it is ! Come on ! I need that wire ! Make the connection ! You have made me do this . Do something ! What 's happening ? We connected a blue wire . I have become ... Death . Claudia , I- - good job . Any chance that went out to the entire Raymond St. James fan club ? I gave up Raymond St. James for this ? So that 's how the power is generated . Huh ! I bet if I spend some time with this thing , I could rig it so I don 't need to recharge . Maybe you should hold off on mentioning that to Artie . Good thought . So , Claudia ... That 's a scary tone . Todd 's cute . Todd who ? This is me ignoring you . I smell popcorn . Hey-oh ! Who wants to watch I Return to Kill , starring our new favorite actor ? You have got to be kidding me . Yeah , I think I 've seen enough of that dude 's movies to last me a lifetime . Wussies . In my room in five , okay ? Remember , I have a big flat screen . Well , item 186 , Philo Farnsworth 's parts A and B are right back where they- - ooh , popcorn . Deal me in . Sure . How else do you watch movies ? Mm-hmm . You know , if we want any of that popcorn ... So , about Todd ... Hey , wait up . So , but he 's really cute . I might have to cut you . Guys , wait up . We talked about it . Well , I think he 's maybe , I don 't know ... The answer is no . He may have left something behind . An echo .

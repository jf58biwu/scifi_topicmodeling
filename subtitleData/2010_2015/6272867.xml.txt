 Max ! Come on ! Don 't keep the Sisters waiting . This is Frey . She 's new here as well . Can you read ? It 's a giraffe . They were from Africa . - You can read ? - Yes . Max , have you been stealing things again ? It breaks my heart . Why do you do this ? So you can save up ? One day buy a ticket up to that place ? That place is not for you , or for me . But it 's not fair , Sister . Why can 't I go there ? Sometimes in life we don 't understand why things are the way they are . But I know one thing . I know you are special . You will do something very important one day . Something you were born for . My little Max . Burn her ID ! MY , how you 've grown ! Are the children here ? Yes , with Dominica . I have a present for you . Go and get it with your mother . It 's next to the couch . They started the fight , Sister . I just want to live there . You see how beautiful it looks to us from here ? Yes . Well ... Now look how beautiful we look from there . Keep it . This is yours now . To never forget about where you come from . You have work to do , Mr. Carlyle . I 'm shitting my pants . Everyone has one special thing , Max . One thing that they are destined to do . One thing they were born for . Hey , Chiquita . Hey . You see how beautiful it looks to us from here ? Now look how beautiful we look from there . This is yours now . To never forget about where you come from . My little Max .

( train whistle blows ) ( brakes hissing ) Kaulder , are you sure it 's safe to get off here ? Kaulder : Yeah , sure . We 're fine .

Woman on TV : ... a los enfrentamientos . También nos están llegando reportes ... Pero puro de día , porque si agarras de noche ... So she said we 're still over 100 km from the coast and the tracks are damaged and we can 't continue by train . Can we catch a bus or something ? Podemos caminar con este- - en este carril- - Nada . No one here travels at night because of the creatures . - ( Kaulder groans ) - So we 'll have to get a ride tomorrow . Pues ahorita no está haciendo mucho tráfico . No hay mucho . Poquito . She said there 's almost no traffic in here because the military are closing this whole coastline in two days . So let me get this straight- - if we don 't make it over to the coast within the next 48 hours , she 's gonna be stuck here for the next six months ?

Single , yeah . Can you say " single " ? Single . ( child babbles ) Man on TV : The US attacks across the border , near the infected zone , as you well know , have started much earlier than last season , taking many people by surprise . Sightings outside the usual migration path have already increased . And although there have been several air strikes already by the United States , the new president basically said that he would not tolerate any activity near the newly-built wall on the US border , - which of course raises all kinds of concerns . - ( sighs ) ( upbeat music playing , chickens clucking ) ( bleating ) ( camera clicking ) Put on the masks . I 'm gonna take a picture . Put on the masks , like when the planes come . Sí sí . ( chuckles ) You don 't have to breathe hard . Thank you . - Oh , no puedo . - Sí , agarralo .

You know what I mean . - ( bus honks ) - Yeah , I know what you mean . Come on . Kaulder : Let me ask you something- - do you know how much money your father 's company pays for a picture of a child killed by a creature ? $ 50,000 . Do you know how much money I get paid for a picture of a happy child ? Nothing . Do you know where that puts me ?

That will be $ 5,000 . - Five thou- - ? - Yeah yeah , 5,000 . Yeah , it 's the only way to go . - $ 5,000 is a lot of money . - Man : Yes , I know , but it 's the only possibility right now . How do you not have tickets ? There are people waiting in line . Kaulder : What are all these people doing ? Yeah , the people are just waiting to go through the land . What do you mean , by land ? These people are going through the infected zone . As you can see there , the infected zone is very risky . If you 've got the money , you go by ferry . If you don 't have the money , you take the risk . Oh , no no no . She doesn 't need to go through the zone . I want to put her on the ferry , all right ? She 's American . She has a passport , yeah ? Oh , that makes a difference . - That 's me . - Look at that picture . - It 's pretty , beautiful . - Thanks . - $ 2,000 . - No , that will be $ 5,000 . It 's the only option you 've got . Tomorrow at 7 : 00 you take it or you go with them . - I 'll give you $ 3,000 . - ( laughs ) No , no way . It 's $ 5,000 . ( sighs ) It 's $ 5,000 , but you 're safe . All right . - Man : It 's a pleasure . - A pleasure . - Thank you . - See you tomorrow . Don 't you go spending that all in one place . - Okay , I feel very happy about that . - Mm-hmm . - ( boat horn blares ) - Sam : What a joke . Kaulder : If he owns the hotels here too , we 're fucked . ( laughs ) I could have a shower . A shower ? Yeah , well , I have to say thanks to you I 'm stuck by the zone tonight . So if I don 't get any award-winning photographs here , then I 'm gonna make you get me five shots of tequila- - five shots . It 's the only way to go . Are you kidding ? Nope , it 's the safest way- - five shots of tequila . Eh , I 'll pay you two . No , the price is five . Okay , three . That 's my final offer . Looks like they gave you the honeymoon suite . I bet my room 's a shithole . So ? Mind if I grab a glass of water while my room 's getting ready ? Okay . Man on TV : ... all around the western perimeter and seem to be massing for an assault . In 11 different locations attacked , three of them as we speak ... - Kaulder : All right . - ( sighs ) Ice cold water . ( Kaulder groans ) Whoa , that is really cold . I stink . I really need a bath . That 's what I need . Want me to scrub your back ? ( chuckles ) Shut up . Woman on TV : ... especially when the migration is driven by seasonal change . Scientists say that more than 100 migrate at this time of year . Whatever you call them , their population is expanding . Kaulder : Well , should we go grab a cocktail ? It 's gonna be dark , so we should- - Yeah , but look . It 's fine . This town isn 't gonna get hit for another two days . But isn 't that kind of like the weatherman who says it 's not gonna rain , and then all of a sudden it rains ? The meteorologist ? There was this guy that lived next door to me when I was attempting to go to college- a big stoner . - Mm-hmm ? His name was Joel . I was like , " Joel , what are you doing ? " He 's like , " Well , I 'm working to be a meteorologist , 'cause it 's the only job that I can be wrong every day and not get fired . " ( laughs ) Joel- - he had a wife , and you could just tell that she was gonna leave him . You know those couples you look at that are just destined for failure ? ( shower running ) Man on TV : On Monday we told you about the efforts to shore up security at the nation 's ports . And the government says great strides have been made , but critics contend that crossings in and out of the infected zone are potentially very porous . Man # 2 : In other news today , the government issued a 400-page report examining just what happened to the crashed space probe nearly six years ago . Woman on TV : While all scientists now agree ... ( phone beeps ) Boy 's voice : Hi , Mommy and Daddy aren 't in , - so leave a message . - ( machine beeps ) Hey , buddy , it 's- - it 's me . I just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday . I 'm not gonna be able to call you tomorrow . So happy birthday , bud . And I promise I 'll call you in a couple of weeks when I land somewhere . Okay . Who was that ? That was reception . They just said my room was ready . Oh , that 's good . ( sighs ) That means you can get out now so I can put my dirty clothes back on . I was just gonna lay here for- - All right . So meet outside in like half an hour ? - Thanks . - ( door opens , closes ) - ( Spanish music playing ) - Dos . All right here . Sam : We gotta do it right if we 're gonna do it . Muchas gracias . Oh my God , that 's really good . ¿ Aquí venden tequila ? Ah , sí sí sí . Fill that up . Sí sí . Muy bien . Whoa , what are those ? ( recorded bird call ) Sold . - ( bird call ) - Oh yeah ! ( laughing ) ( bird calling ) ( laughing ) - ( music stops ) - ( scattered chattering ) Kaulder : The vibe just changed . ( crickets chirping ) Look at all these people . How are you feeling ? Okay .

You 're gonna have a lot more fun tomorrow than I 'm having . ( laughs ) When are you guys getting married ? I don 't know . We haven 't set a date . Oh . - We 're celebrating here . - Cheers . Cheers . Man over P.A. : Give back our homes . Stop the bombing . Give back our homes . Paren el bombardeo . Devuélvannos nuestras casas . Stop the bombing . Give back our homes .

Have you ever- - did you know that ? Did I know what ? That dolphins can only hold their breath for , like , 12 minutes . No . They 're mammals . Does that mean they have belly buttons ? You know , they- - they do have belly buttons . You 're a marine biologist , aren 't you ? That 's what you do . You look like a marine biologist . " Biologist " - - that 's a weird word . - How 's your hand ? - It 's the same . - Yeah ? - ( crowd cheering ) Sounds like they 're having a party . On top of that , my air conditioner is broken in my room . So , you know- - I don 't know . That 's a king size . ( chuckles ) Draw a line down the bed ? No ?

Yeah , I did too . I mean , hanging out on top of a 400-year-old church is what I do on the weekends all the time , but it was different doing it with you . I gotta go to bed . All right . See you in the morning ? Yeah , see you in the morning . Okay . You sure you 're okay in here ? Good night . Is that a creature in there ? ( laughs ) Good night .

It 's a lot better now without all that weight . - ( chuckles ) - What do you mean ? The ring . - Does that hurt ? - Yeah , I wouldn 't push it too far . Thanks . Hey , no problem . You need to- - you need to move it around . No , I mean " Thanks . " Yeah . You 're welcome . I 'm sorry about the other night . It 's okay . I was drunk . I 'm sorry . I just don 't want you to think of me like that when you think of me . It 's okay . ( chuckles ) It 's okay . You don 't have to do it perfect . ( sighs ) Well , we 'll be home in the morning .

What did you find , Cortez ? Sam : Oh my God . That 's the biggest man-made structure I 've ever seen . Sam : It 's like the Seventh Wonder . Kaulder : God , it 's huge . Sam : I thought I 'd be a lot happier to see it . I feel like I could cry , but I don 't know if it would be a happy cry or a sad cry . It 's different looking at America from the outside ... in . You know , just sitting right outside and looking in . You know , when you get home it 's so easy to forget all this . I mean , tomorrow we 'll be back to our separate lives in our , like , perfect suburban homes . You know , everything that we 've been through- - it won 't matter anymore . How old do you think that girl was ? Four ? Five years old ? Let 's talk about something else . ( sniffles ) Something funny . You know how people laugh different , depending on who they 're around ?

This 'll probably be the most amazing place you 've ever slept . ( Sam sighs ) There 's not a light for miles . I just hope the clouds break . Oh , sure , sometimes . I don 't see him that often . - How come ? - He lives with his mother and she 's married now . But you 're still his father . Yeah , but he doesn 't know that . Doesn 't that bother you ? It 's just easier that way . I don 't want to confuse him . There 's no one in here and the power 's off . ( jet engines roaring ) Hello ? What happened here ? I don 't know . If you ask me , this looks like an air strike . All these people 's homes , but where are the people ? ( camera beeps , clicking ) Do you think anybody 's under here ? I feel like if there was anybody here , we 'd smell ' em . Let 's just keep going . There 's gotta be somebody somewhere . ( jet engines roaring ) Are you sure it 's dead ? Yeah , it 's dead . Stay here . - ( camera clicks ) - ( flies buzzing ) Hello ? Don 't come in here , Sam !

Excuse me . Have you seen anybody else ? ( quacks ) ( barks ) I 've got another thing to do . ( muttering ) Another thing you 've got to do . Cheese on the back of the neck . Drunk . Melts . Cheese melts melts . Three blind mice ! Three blind mice ! Do you see that light ? Yeah . ( phone rings ) Woman : Hello , 911 . What is your emergency ?

One- - male 's Andrew Kaulder ; female , Sam Wynden . Can you describe what you 're wearing ? Does it matter ? We 're the only two people here . We haven 't seen anyone in the last 48 hours from the southern tip of the border . Okay , don 't move from that location . We have an army patrol in the area we 're sending over right now . They should be with you very soon . Just stay where you are , okay ? ( thunder rumbling ) Kaulder : I always wanted to work behind a register . - Really ? - Yeah . I thought it 'd be cool to work behind a register . - I used to have a register . - I don 't doubt that . - ( laughs ) And I had real money in it too . - I don 't doubt that either . There were just $ 1 bills though . - Yeah . - Yeah . lsn 't that funny how you imitate what your parents do ? Obviously your dad counted money , so you 'd sit there and count your money . - ( laughs ) - My kid 'll ... imitate me . You should give him a camera . You look good behind a register . So what are you gonna do tomorrow ? I don 't know . What are you gonna do ? ( tisks ) I don 't know . Okay . Gotta make a phone call . I 'll give you some privacy to make your own . - ( door chimes ) - Is Tommy awake ? Yeah , will you- - will you put him on ? Hey , buddy . Happy birthday . ( beeps , ringing ) Hi . Yeah , it 's me . With big wheels ? Yeah ? What color was it ? Yeah . I miss you too . Trust me- - it 's fine . Huh . I know . ( inhales ) You did ? Yeah . I 'm sorry . I 'm really tired . Okay . No , I 'll see you then . Yeah . No , I 'll see you then . No , you don 't need to come down here . It 's- - no , because that would be pointless . 'Cause they 're gonna be here soon so- - Hey . Yeah . No , I 'll be home in two days . Yeah . No no no , I 'm-I 'm- - I 'm fine . I 'm fine . Yeah , I just wanted to make sure that you guys were okay . Okay . ( receiver clatters ) Listen , don 't worry . I 'm gonna see you . It 's- - it 's fine . We 'll have plenty of time to talk . Well , that 's good . That 's really good . ( sighs ) I miss you too . ( sighing ) Okay . I love you too . ( thunder crashing ) ( door opens , chimes ) ( creature chittering ) - ( clatters ) - ( creature chitters loudly ) - ( TV turns off ) - ( creature chitters loudly ) ( panting ) ( creature calling ) ( creature # 2 calling ) ( thudding steps ) ( thunder crashing ) ( crickets chirping ) ( army radio chatter ) ( man vocalizing " Ride of the Valkyries " ) ( helicopter whirring ) This is it . I don 't want to go home . - ( brakes squeaking ) - ( radio chatter ) - Man : We 've located one male and one female . - Man # 2 : Move move move ! - Man : We 're heading in . - This is a restricted area . - Sir , you need to come with me . - We need to get you out of here now .

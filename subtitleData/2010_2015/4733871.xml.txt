That was the female pharaoh 's name , Hatshepsut . So Hatshepsut created the artifact using the pheromones of honey bees . Well , beehive , bee . It makes sense . Yes , and then she would prick herself with the bee and then inject the stinger , really , into her body . She became the queen bee . Precisely . Ah-choo ! What about her ? What about who ?

Uh , Amanda 's been stung . Did she touch anyone ? Aside from her whole bridal party , no . I 'm thinking the finger is the source of the infection , so don 't let her touch anyone else with it . Artie , we checked her finger . There 's no sign of the stinger . Yeah , it makes its way through the body . It targets the glands , and it causes the pheromone production . And then , whenever she touches anyone , she immediately creates these worker bees who become slavishly devoted to her every need and protection . Is that why they 're chasing us ? Well , you know , probably . Because you 're seen as a threat . And--oh , wait , wait , wait . Yes , yes . It appears that things went very badly for Hatshepsut .

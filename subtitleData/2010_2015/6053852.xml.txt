 NARRATOR : Two weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down on Chester 's Mm , cutting us off from the rest of the world . Why the dome is here , or what mysteries lie ahead , we still don 't know . Every day , it tests our limits , Ripped By mstoll bringing out the best and the worst in us . Some say we 'll be stuck here forever . But we will never stop fighting to find a way out . - Why are you looking for Sam ? - He 's known who Melanie is all along . Wondering when you 'd show up . Aren 't you afraid of people seeing us ? You made a promise 25 years ago to make sure that what we buried stayed buried . You 've come to set me free . My mother said you had answers . I want them . - Aah ! LYLE : I 'm out for good now . JULIA : Those are the fingertips of a hand . Looks like Angie got a piece of whoever did this to her . You think this is where Lyle disappeared to ? It 's a tunnel . - You tried to kill us all . - Julia , I didn 't do it . What Big Jim and Rebecca tried to do is inexcusable . But it 's not unforgivable . I think she 's done a hell of a job running Chester 's Mill . [ JUNIOR EXHALES ] REBECCA : What do you see ? - Basement . I didn 't know it was even under this part of the school . SAM : Any sign of Lyle ? JUNIOR : There 's footprints . They 're heading up into this tunnel . Be careful . - Barbie is sheriff now . Maybe- - - Lyle killed Angie . I tracked him down here . I 'm doing this . Not alone . REBECCA : Please come back . Lyle 's dangerous . Not for long . Hey . I need to borrow your Prius . You going looking for Lyle ? Yeah . Well , as long as he 's out there on the loose , he 's my problem . I 'm not gonna sleep tonight unless I do a few more sweeps . Being sheriff already looks good on you . Also , if you talk to Sam , get ahold of me on the walkie , because I want to question him too . JULIA : About Melanie ? Melanie , Angie , what he 's been doing all day . I 'm not pointing any fingers , just trying to explore other options . Be careful . I thought you were with Joe and Norrie . They went home . They 're mad at me . I did something stupid . You want to tell me what ? I kissed Joe . I know . I just wanted to feel normal for a minute . - Melanie , you are normal . - I died . Nothing about me is normal . Why am I even here ? Because I 'm connected to some egg ? That no one even knows where it is . Actually , I do . I dropped it in the lake a few minutes before I found you . Why 'd you do that ? Because the dome wanted me to . It chose me . And I think it brought you back for a reason . What reason ? I don 't know . - It was only one kiss . I 'm sorry . - But it 's not just that you kissed her . Ever since Melanie got here , everything 's been about her . - It 's like there 's no us anymore . - But there is . I love you , Norrie . Too bad . I don 't love you . - What are you doing ? - Why should I stay here then ? Big Jim 's not my family . Or Carolyn . If you don 't love me , then why would you want me around here , right ? Right . [ DOOR SLAMS ] JIM : It 's a good feeling , isn 't it ? Doing right by the town . I love that feeling . You 've had it so rarely . Yeah , well , you 'll disappoint them soon enough . You trying to rattle me , Jim ? Don 't want you to feel too good about yourself . You and I both know whose town this is . It 's not yours . It 's not mine . And the first thing I 'm gonna do is give it back to them . - Give it back to them ? - Voting . These people are entitled to a say in what happens to them . Interesting . You 're gonna put a town on the brink in the hands of scared , desperate people ? Is there a brain under that hair ? These people don 't need to talk about their feelings . They need to be led . I did you and Rebecca a favor by convincing these people not to string you two up . Don 't test my patience . The only reason this town didn 't riot is because I took your hand . Half this town is mine . Don 't you forget that . Hey . You know what your girlfriend 's doing ? She 's putting every major town decision to a vote . Let us twiddle our thumbs while Rome burns . Last I heard , voting was a right . Yeah , well , tell her it 's a bad idea . She won 't listen to me . That 's a wise woman . Look , Barbie , you and I have been on the same side when it counts . Hey , Jim , who told Julia that I was in on this whole extermination plan ? See , every time I have given you the benefit of the doubt , it bites me in the ass . Now , I 'm not gonna cross Julia , and if you try to , I 'm not gonna be as forgiving as she is . REBECCA [ OVER RADIO ] : Barbie ? You there ? Barbie ? - Yeah . Go ahead , Rebecca . REBECCA : I 'm at the high school . Sam and Junior are tracking Lyle . - You better get here . - On my way . JUNIOR : Lyle had to bust out the back of the locker to get down here . SAM : We must be a half a mile in by now . JUNIOR : You want to go back , go back . I don 't need your help shooting him . SAM : Look , Junior , I know you loved Angie , but killing someone is no small thing . You 've done that ? Of course not . Clint Dundee put his hands all over Angie . I hunted him down and shot him in the heart . I appreciate you looking after me , but Lyle is dying today . Jumpy ? You want to stop pointing that thing at me , Junior ? Sam . Been a while . People looking for you . Yeah , I 've been busy . I 'm not gonna let Junior hunt for a lunatic by himself . I 'm moving on . You go on ahead . I 'm just gonna hang back . You know , make sure no one else sneaks up on us . My mom 's journal . Junior , stop . Junior , look out . SAM : Barbie , watch out . [ RUMBLING ] [ COUGHING ] BARBIE : Sam , you okay ? SAM : Oh . I 'm bashed up , but all right . BARBIE : Oh . Junior . Junior , you okay ? JUNIOR : Stay there . I 'll get some help . BARBIE : God . - Your head 's bleeding . It could have been worse . Thanks for the push . Yeah . I think Lyle did this . The town barber makes bombs ? He 's always been a crafty guy , and he 's gone crazier than a rat in a jar since the dome came down . He 's smart enough to bait the trap with a journal . Well , we 're not getting out the way we came . Guess we 'll try that way . After you . Just stay still , okay ? There you go . You thought it was a good idea to go down there with that drunk ? He 's done more for me than you did . What are you even doing here ? I don 't need your permission to go here or anywhere else . Give it a rest . I 'm trying to bandage your son . What happened ? I heard you radio Barbie . Where is he ? Sam and I were tracking down Lyle . Barbie came after us and then all of a sudden , I tripped on something and there was a cave-in . You went through this locker ? - Where are they ? Are they all right ? - There 's rocks blocking them in . We have to get them out . In case you haven 't noticed , we got bigger problems than those two . The acidity in the red rain must have fried the topsoil . Yeah , well , it 's blowing around everywhere and coating everything , including the inside of the dome . Which is semipermeable . If the dome walls get clogged , no air is gonna be able to get in . And then we suffocate . All of us . How long until that happens ? There are steps we can take , okay ? Mist dispersal . Get water into the air as quickly as possible to ground the dust . Fire hose , fan . A giant windmill maybe . I had the kids working on some , but I had to put it on the back burner . We still have all the materials though . Least your idea is doing more than Julia 's to help . You just want to see Barbie and Sam dead . So I guess it 's up to me then , huh ? You know , they could be in part of the old cement factory . We find a map of the tunnel system , we might find another way . - Can you find one ? - Yeah , sure . JUNIOR : Lyle might have already gotten out . There 's no way of knowing if he 's down there . Better he 's here than hunting Barbie and Sam down there . Yeah , but if he 's back up here , he 's just as dangerous . Sam and I found out that Lyle wasn 't just after Angie . He 's after the four hands . How does he know about the hands ? My mom drew a picture of us holding up the dome way back when . Now , Lyle thinks that if we 're dead , the rapture comes . - So he wanted to kill you too ? - Yeah . He knew I 'd follow him . I 'm pretty sure that bomb there was meant for me . We need to make sure Joe and Norrie are safe . - I 'll do that . - Be careful . - I 'll go with him . - Melanie , I don 't- - They 're my friends too . I 'm going . I 'll make sure she 's safe . I promise . BARBIE : So you 've known Lyle all your life , right ? SAM : Yeah , we were friends growing up . BARBIE : You hear or seen anything recently that makes you think he may have killed Angie ? I haven 't seen him in years . But between kidnapping Rebecca , clocking Junior and all that , makes sense . So then why did you guys stop being friends ? Something happen ? Nope . I suppose people lust grow apart . You got a preference ? You go left , I go right , we cover more ground . You tired of me already ? I 'm tired of you eyeing me for no reason , yeah . JUNIOR : You 're awfully quiet . MELANIE : I 'm scared . Aren 't you ? It 's okay . You heard what I told Julia . I promised I 'd keep you safe . You look so much like Sam when he was younger . Melanie , what the hell is going on with you ? I have to tell you something crazy . I think Lyle is who killed me . Come on . Come on . Get inside . Come on , everyone , get inside . The dome 's walls are already plugging up . No air is gonna be able to get through . And if we don 't act now , we 're all gonna choke to death . [ INHALES ] The air is too hot and dry . But I know that if we work together we can make this plan happen . We can make a windmill like Rebecca Pine 's class was building , and we can use it to fan water through the air , and- - What 's in the water , Jim ? Another virus ? Do you think I made that decision lightly ? I put my own life at risk . My son 's life at risk . Just trying like hell to get us through this thing somehow . What 's Julia say about this windmill ? Well , I don 't know , because Julia 's not here . I am . But I guess I 'm not supposed to give orders anymore . That 's apparently not my place . So let 's do it democratically . All those in favor of the mist-dispersal system doing something instead of nothing , raise your hand . Everyone in favor of Jim shutting up while we wait the storm out ? Great . Where you going ? Neither wind , nor rain , nor creepy ass dust . Joe ? Norrie ? Joe ? Pauline did that , - didn 't she ? JUNIOR : Yeah . It 's so strange to think you were alive all those years ago . And that you knew my mom when she was a girl . She was the first friend I made when I moved here . - What was she like ? - Cheerful . Really brave . I 'm sorry she died so unhappy . I should have been here for her . It 's not like you could help it . Can you keep a secret ? Yes . Do you hit on literally everyone ? - I wasn 't- - NORRIE : Don 't answer . - It was rhetorical . JUNIOR : Norrie , why are you crying ? - Where 's Joe ? - Gone . - Gone where ? - I don 't know . Are you happy ? Norrie , Lyle 's on the loose and he 's coming after the four hands . We have to find Joe before he does . We 're just standing here ? Hey . Sorry , I thought you were Lyle . Yeah ? Thought we were trying to cover more ground . - We are . - But you double back and follow me . What are you talking about ? I went right . How did you get in front of me ? I went left . Let 's keep going . Maybe you can put my mind at ease about something . SAM : What 's up ? Where were you the night that Angie McAlister died ? - Are you kidding me ? - Hey , just answer my question . - I was looking for Melanie . - See , that 's funny . Because I haven 't seen you all day . We only just found out that her name was Melanie yesterday . - Junior told me . - No , he didn 't . You knew her 25 years ago . You 've known who she is since Julia rescued her from the lake . Only you didn 't say a word to anyone . Why didn 't you say anything ? About Melanie being back from the dead ? You tell me how to start that conversation . Just answer the question that you keep dodging . [ GRUNTING ] You gonna say thank you ? Is that Lyle 's ? Has to be . Do you think he went out this way ? I think you go out that way , you go out forever . NORRIE : Joe , are you in here ? [ NORRIE COUGHING ] Oh , thank God , you idiot . We were worried about you . We looked all over . - I can take care of myself . - Not with Lyle wanting to kill us . He wants the four hands dead . That 's why he killed Angie . That 's the reason ? Maybe I should thank him then . - What ? - Angie 's out now . Maybe that 's the only way any of us are gonna get out . MELANIE : It didn 't work for me . I died . I came back . Will she ? It took a while for me . I think the dome chose all of us for something . And now we have to deal with it . We need to figure it out together . I 'm sorry , Melanie . I think we need to stay put . Angie would want me to keep you safe . No . Angie would have wanted answers . She wouldn 't have stopped till she got them . Junior , we have to do this . I would rather risk dying again than not knowing why I 'm here any longer . [ SIGHS ] Do you have any idea where to start ? The lake . We start there . SAM : You think Lyle jumped ? BARBIE : Well , he sure as hell didn 't climb down . Maybe he went right back there . - Got out that way . - I told you , I went right . It brought me back to you . I didn 't hear it hit anything . This thing must be deep as hell . - Something 's off here . - Understatement . BARBIE : I mean , given how far we just walked we should have hit the dome wall by now . Maybe the dome doesn 't come down this far ? Except that everything we know about it says that it does . You 're sure you went right back there ? You know what , man ? I 'm sick of you calling me a liar . Who the hell knows your story anyway ? You show up the day the dome does . No one knows where you come from and you don 't say . Shouldn 't you be telling me what 's going on ? You 've known about the egg since 1988 . When you and Melanie , Lyle , Pauline , when you all found it . - You know more than you 're saying . - That makes two of us . You find the cement factory maps ? REBECCA : I just grabbed everything and brought them . [ COUGHING ] This is almost as bad as outside . Honestly , Julia , the storm is more my area . Oh , yes . All science is your area . I 'm a teacher in Chester 's Mill , I 'm not an engineer for Lockheed . I 'm all too aware of my limits . And I know what kind of damage you 're capable of . - You don 't trust me ? - I forgave you . It 's not the same thing . Here we go . Except this says the cement factory never extended under the school . Nowhere even in the vicinity . So who the hell went into the school basement and dug a tunnel ? And why ? All that matters right now is there 's no other way down there . And no way to rescue Barbie and Sam that we know of . Unless we blast the blockage . And if they 're pinned by debris ? They get blasted too ? Junior said he yelled at them . We can tell them not to stand next to the thing we 're gonna blow up . You got a better idea ? [ SIGHS ] [ WIND WHISTLING ] [ COUGHING AND GASPING ] Ben ! Sit down . Benny . What is it , honey ? JIM : He can 't breathe . ANDREA : Here , have some water . Water 's not gonna help him . He needs his inhaler . It 's okay , honey . You 're gonna be okay . [ INHALES ] One more . Outside 's not getting any better , folks . Pretty soon , none of us are gonna be able to breathe . Anybody want to put it to another vote ? I 'm down . SAM : This is about Julia , isn 't it ? All this suspicious crap . If it makes you feel any better , nothing happened . BARBIE : Yeah , you 're right about one thing . I don 't like you hanging around Julia . I think you 're shady as hell . But right now , we 're both stuck on some cliff , so how about you shut up and let me think about that ? How the hell could we be past the dome wall ? How could I go left and you go right , somehow we both end up in the same place ? It 's like something wanted us to end up here . Is this how it 's finally gonna do me in , by driving me out of my mind ? The only thing this damn dome 's ever done is bring pain . I thought I was crazy when I first saw Melanie back at the lake . I just kept thinking there 's no way it could be the same girl . Except it is . What happened the night that she died , Sam ? None of your business . Well , you could tell me here , or you can tell me in jail after I 've hauled you out of here by your throat . Only reason I can think of as to why you 'd hide it , - you killed Melanie . - Don 't tell me what I did . - I loved her . - Well , then you tell me what you did . You want to know ? The night we found the meteorite , none of us could believe it . And then we found the egg inside . Melanie said everybody was scared of it , except her . We all thought it was dangerous . I just wanted to leave it alone . But Melanie decided that it needed to be protected . That it was alive somehow , and scared . How did she end up dead ? The egg started screaming . Pauline grabbed her head and said , " It 's killing me . " Lyle flipped . Said , " We gotta help Pauline . " I tried to get the egg , but Melanie wouldn 't let it go . Lyle went after her . I let him . He pushed her , she fell into the crater , her head hit the meteorite . We panicked . Pauline begged me to help Lyle . I did . I left the love of my life in a hole like garbage . And now she 's back . JIM : All right , let 's hoist it on three . One , two , three . [ GRUNTING ] Come on . [ CHATTERING ] JULIA : Barbie ? Can you hear me ? Sam ? Maybe they kept going . - How many ways do you know to kill ? - Well , it 's how I apply it that counts . Can you not blow us up before we save them ? Yeah , I 'm trying . What are you doing teaching high school ? - You mean , how 'd I screw up my life ? - That 's not what I meant . I was headed to Cornell before I came to Chester 's Mill . Why the change ? My dad got sick . I had to take care of him before he died . Can 't be all that different from your story . You are a journalist , right ? Was Chester 's Mill your dream job ? No , it wasn 't . See ? Neither of us wanted to be here . But we are . It 's not fate . We made choices , and we ended up here . Maybe I could have helped more people if I hadn 't helped my dad , but that wasn 't gonna happen . So you and me are stuck doing this . Why 'd you work with Jim ? Because I thought his heart was in the right place . I was wrong about that . I don 't think I 'm wrong about you . Careful . JOE : The dust cleared up . Yeah . So , what now ? - It 's been hours . - The egg knows we 're here . I can feel it . It 's like it 's waiting . All I know , this egg isn 't showing itself . Even with all of us here . Maybe we have to do something together . Like what ? Like when Angie was here , and we all touched the mini dome . Melanie was one of the original four hands . Maybe she still counts . - So Angie 's replaceable ? - No one 's replacing your sister . But Norrie 's right . I don 't hear any other ideas . It 's working . So why is Melanie back now ? To haunt me ? To bring everyone more pain ? - It 's not all pain under this thing . - The hell it 's not . Every day is a new nightmare . Dame 's a slow execution for everyone in here . You of all people should know that . Yeah , but I deal with it . You look for what makes ... What makes going on worth it . Take Julia . Being with her , that 's ... It 's a chance for me to be good . The dome scares me too , but it 's not all pain . Sometimes I see Melanies face in the dark with the blood starting to pour out . If I could change one thing in my life , that 'd be it . Yeah , I know how you feel . Oh , yeah ? Who 'd you kill ? A lot of people . Given the way things are going , I know it 's gonna happen again . I don 't want that but sometimes you see their faces and you wonder- - Are they gonna be waiting for you on the other side ? - Yep . - Yeah . The other day I found her waiting for me on this side . What the hell can I say to her ? BARBIE : Well , unh , when we get out of here , maybe you can give it a try . I know Melanie just wants answers more than anything . As far as what happened between you two 25 years ago , that 's between you and her . Thank you . Thanks for not letting me fall . - Hey , those aren 't from rocks . - Hey ! Where 'd you get those scratches , Sam ? Put that there , and this one will fit right here . And I connect the fuse . Thank God for the Department of Roads and Repair . - You praying ? - No , but I hope to God this works . Barbie ? Sam ? If you can hear me , get way , way back . Okay . Let 's do this . Back to the entrance , right ? Okay . BARBIE : Those are defensive wounds from fingernails . - You 're kidding , right ? - Angie was a fighter . She got a piece of whoever tried to kill her . The skin under her fingernails showed that . - Barbie- - - You killed her , Sam . Not Lyle , you . And everything you 've done has been to put the blame back onto him . The guy 's a maniac . You saw what he did to Rebecca . And he attacked my nephew . You killed a 19-year-old girl that your nephew loved . I had to ! Everything Pauline put in her journal has come true . It says in here that if those four kids die , the dome comes down . It 's a sacrifice I have to make to save everyone . - You would even kill Junior ? - At some point I 'll have to . I 'll finish it , and I 'll finally be free . Then I will kill myself . Or you can kill me . Hell , I 'll thank you for it . You will never see my face in the dark , I swear . [ COCKS GUN ] You 're not even gonna touch those kids . I 'm taking you in . And your justice is gonna be whatever Junior does to you once he finds out . She 's not so bad . Now you believe her ? Yes . I 'm sorry . For what ? For not giving you a break like you gave me after my mom died . I 'm sorry I ever made you feel like I didn 't love you . I love you too . [ DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES ] Okay , everythings locked up . Do you think Lyle is following us ? I don 't know . I 'm just being careful . You guys ready ? Let 's find out . Pink stars . Like we saw before . I saw that in my dream . I 've seen it too . Years ago . It 's in my home town , Zenith . What does it mean ? JULIA : This is the right call , isn 't it ? They 're smart guys , right ? They 'll know to put some space between them and the blockage ? They won 't be hurt . You ready ? I trust you . Hey , what are you doing ? You 'll never let me finish what I have to , so it 's on you now . I don 't care if you live or die . If you 've got any sense of right or wrong left , you 're gonna look Junior in the face and tell him what you did . Take it . When the time comes , you 'll need it . - You owe Junior the truth . - You 'll see , it 's all pain . When you watch enough people die , when you watch Julia die , you will put the knife to those kids yourself . I 'm so tired , Barbie . Sam . Sam ! REBECCA : No sign of Barbie or Sam . JULIA : They 've gotta be in here somewhere . REBECCA : Julia . Did a good thing today , Jim . Yeah , honestly it 's a relief just to lend a hand . I think we all have something to be proud of today , right ? Real question is , where has Julia been all day ? Well , I heard that Barbie got into some kind of trouble over at the high school . She decided to help him instead of pitching in with us . Well , you don 't say . I guess sometimes love wins out over doing your job . Barbie . Oh , God . Are you okay ? Yeah . I 'm okay . JULIA : Where 's Sam ? He 's gone . Ripped By mstoll

 Baxter ! You 're on the strike force ! Take the Guges Ds ! Briareos ! You 'll focus on deciphering the coded signal ! You have 120 minutes to figure it out . Lance . Put me on the strike force too . You don 't have your " Hundred Hands " for slugging it out . Have more faith in your comrades . You need to trust them more ! Forget that . I have faith in each person 's skills but you 're the only one I can really trust . then you should quit ES.W.A.T. You don 't understand anything . you 're completely blind when it comes to me ! the Human Liberation Front will launch an assault on Tartaros . the Stymphalean will wipe out Olympus . The Stymphalean carries a 20-kiloton nuclear warhead . That is all . What are the demands ? That Tartaros ' cryogenic equipment be shut off for a full 24 hours . Poseidon will be set back twenty years ... What are our options ? The Stymphalean is currently being controlled remotely . ES.W.A.T. is working on taking over its communication systems . We will need to seek Urban Planning 's judgment as well . Convene the Legislative Bureau and the Senate too . And I 'll wish to consult with Gaia . Have you figured out the Stymphalean 's comms link ? It communicates remotely by randomly switching and acoustic transmissions on a nano-second scale . There 's only one way to stop it ... Cut the power supply to each and every system . What are you going to do about this ? the entire Ark Project will go up in smoke . Eurys . The Prime Minister is well aware of the situation . I may very well go down in Olympus ' history as being a coldhearted leader . Then we 're to engage it ? Eurys . Focus on keeping Tartaros' gene banks powered and running . You 're also to decide which types should have highest priority . I 'm placing the future of this city in ES.W.A.T. ' s hands . That Landmate is a Hekatoncheires . what 's with this signal ? but it varies ever-so-slightly . though ? A heartbeat ? I refuse to accept this ! remember ? ! Could you sign this cyborg modification consent form ? Huh ? I 'm afraid his life-support functions won 't hold out much longer . Briareos is going to die ? ! I won 't let Briareos die ... I absolutely won 't ! Deunan . This is Deunan 's heartbeat ! I 'm certain of it . They 're using Deunan 's heartbeat to encode their signal . Source of transmission ? ! Locating now ! Point 20A-32N ! If only I 'd been stronger ... If only I 'd been by your side ... like Karl did . Like my detestable old man ? ! I have a kid on the way . I want to teach her how to live so she can survive anywhere she goes . I want to keep my family safe . Briareos ... Olympus ! This is Deunan ! respond ! Deunan ! Briareos ! I 'm ! It 's your heartbeat ! They 're using your heartbeat to encode the ... The comms channel 's been cut . Damn ! Tartaros will be within effective bombing range in 1000 seconds . My heartbeat ? Encode ? They 're using my heartbeat as a code to control this ... You catch on quickly . What for ? ! of course . You 're not worried I might end my own life ? ! Your pulse will set off the warhead should it go over a certain amount . you won 't do it . You aren 't foolish enough to end your own life . Not even for a mission . What are you ? Our focus now is to stabilize the signal . 113 . Prepare for snipe attack . I have to protect our paradise ! There is no paradise . Huh ? People are unable to trust one another . That was the cause of the endless conflict that nearly destroyed the world . You know that . Where in such a world could paradise possibly exist ? There is no paradise . 940 seconds until Tartaros is within bombing range . She 's my daughter ... The only family I have left . no matter what it takes . Even if it makes me seem like a monster right now . Deunan is vulnerable without you to watch her back . Briareos ... Vengeance belongeth unto me . Briareos ! Briareos ? ! My heart ... How remorseless the people of Olympus are . I assume they 've discovered your heartbeat is being used to encrypt the signal . Yet they have no hesitation in killing a loved one for their own aims . Killing me ? ! Deunan ... I took Karl 's words and made them my own mindset . then I at least want to protect you in my own way . 113 ! Don 't concentrate all of your Hekaton functions on sniping ! no matter what . I 'll protect you while you 're vulnerable ... I 'll watch your back ! Briareos ... How long are we going to keep living like this ? Until we find our paradise . You know that . This can 't be ! Heartbeat has ceased . Signal code is flat and stable now . We now have access to the Stymphalean 's control functions . ES.W.A.T. has gained 60 % of total control . Lead it to the predetermined intercept point inside Olympus . and 29 . Focus on disarming the warhead now . Roger that . Surrender . Your scheme is over now . Deia ! Choosing your mission over the life of the woman you love ... but the heart of a machine as well . But how ? Your heart stopped beating ! but resuscitation is something else altogether ! Giving up on life ... was not part of my upbringing . Safeguarding the place we 've reached and never giving up on living ... That is our way of life . then ? Is that a result of Karl Knute 's genes ? Genes have nothing to do with it . It was to protect what needs protecting ... For the paradise where we can live like ourselves ! Paradise ... A paradise where people can live like people ... Deia . Tell me why you did this . I 'll listen to you as a friend first . Paradise no longer exists ... You intend to break into the system ? ! You 'll fry your brain ! Intrusion detected in the Stymphalean 's control network ! Deia ! having lost my beloved and my paradise ... Stop resisting ! Your head 'll be next ! How I envy you ... your man is still alive ! Deia ! Briareos ! Deunan ! Get out of there ! We 're taking it out ! Were you worried you were going to die then ? Were you ? I ... felt I did it to protect you . I felt the same way . remember ? Deunan ... I 'm glad you 're alive . Your man is still alive ... Deia ... She said she lost her family . It 's possible that was true and not just a cover story . She must 've already lost what needed her protection and love ... What needed her love ... all you have left is to believe or disbelieve in the path you 're on . Want to hit the road again ? somewhere paradise-like ?

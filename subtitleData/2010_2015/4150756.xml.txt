 Light , like a diamond tiara Breaking the ... Uh . Aaah ! You 're amazing . Where have you been my whole life ? I don 't know ... we talked about it . You don 't want to be here when Phillip shows up . Okay . Bar Karma 1x01 " A Man Walks into a Bar " Hey , man , take a seat . Get lucky last night ? I get it . I 'm naked ... bedroom turned into a bar . I 'm dreaming . Damn . That means I fell asleep . Uh , this isn 't right , is it ? I thought suits were sorta back . Because of Reservoir Dogs . Has that not come out , yet ? It came out almost 20 years ago . That suit has nothing to do with that movie . It 'll come back around again . Everything does . God ... I love this song . Reminds me of my first year of high school . Oh , sweety , this song came out this year . Uh . Nice choice . Who are you talking to ? Hi , I 'm Dana . I 'm Doug . Pleasure to meet you , Dana . Listen , kid . There 's a 500 year old dress code here . Put your pants on . - Who you calling kid , I got at least ten years on you , sweety . Well , ... yes ... and no . Listen , Doug , you 're not dreaming . What time does your pocket watch say ? Five " O " five . - You can 't keep time in a dream . That 's how you can always check if your dreaming . Any clock you look at will have gibberish . Awsome . I 'll try to remember that when I wake up . - You are a stubborn bastard . Aren 't you ? Uh , don 't mind James . He 's a former alcoholic . That was at least five lifetimes ago . And , twelve and twenty lifetimes ago . Maybe , I should leave you two alone , um . Uh , if it were only that easy . Hey ... What 's happening ? Take a seat , partner . This might help explain it . - Should we start the show ? No time like the present . This just in to MW News . Internet wonderkind , Doug Jones , was arrested downtown today . - Murderer ! ( shouted off camera ) What was that ? Who are you ? Jones will be arraigned in federal court later this week . Recently named one of the top grossing internet moguls in America . I 'm out of here . Where ever you go , there you are , right ? So , I can 't leave ? - I wouldn 't say that . You can try that door . Now , where do you think he is ? - Somewhere between the beginning ... or the end , I guess . ( garble of voices ) Hey . Look who 's here ? Please , just tell me what 's going on . Uh , relax . Try and enjoy the ride . Perhaps a beverage would help ? - Ah , because liquor helps make everything clearer . That 's how this whole mess started . Wait . Is this just a really elaborate intervention ? It 's an intervention of sorts . Pick a glass . To Doug . Being here now . What was that ? Uh , it 's a new kind of bourbon . The 2060 batch ? - 2080 . Ah , the Emperor 's stuff . I 'm talking about what just happened . When we touched glasses , it was like ... electricity or something . Oh , we probably passed through a new timeline . Oh . Right . Duh ! It 's cool , huh ? I think we have different definitions of the word , cool . Ever experience deja vu ? Yeah . - Then you felt a branching event . Deja vu is just a brief quantum entanglement with your Alpha . My ... Alpha ? - The verson of you that remained in the original timeline . You , being in the Beta , of course . Then , who 's my Alpha ? - The you , who 's not a Beta . How 's my Alpha , not a Beta , if my Alpha and my Beta are both me ? Let me show you . This is the way you see the universe . One road , which seems straight , when you 're on it . And , this is the way the universe actually is . Many roads or what we call branching events . Running in parallel . And , we are ... here . I 've got to go to the bathroom . It 's going to be okay . Maybe , sooner than you thought . Whaaah ! No . - Do you think he 's looking out the window ? - That or he has a case of apocalypse stomach . - Ha . He 's gonna be a tough one . - I know . Totally your type . I can break him . Um ... Yeah . Not going to be a problem . Where are you going ? There 's a time for balancing the universe . And , a time for balancing the books . What is this place ? Think of it as a karmic rest stop . Why am I here ? We 're just trying to help you catch a lucky break . Uh , yeah , I 'm probably one of the luckiest guys you ever met . - You were , actually . And , that 's one of the reasons you 're here . Not everyone has your luck or gets your breaks . Aaaah . This bloody nonsense , again . Aah , good friend , William Wallace , is back . Aren 't we closed ? Uh , it 's always happy hour somewhere in the universe . Seriously ? As in , Braveheart ? Why do ya keep havin me back to this odd hovel ? I 'm not changing my mind . Last time , we forgot to mention ... the way you die . You 're hanged , drawn and quartered , William . And , not in that order , I 'm afraid . You 're not God . And , you 're not the King of Scotland . So , I can a trust ya . Nor , your wee moving paintings . Don 't mean to be rude , but I 've got to get back to my men . We 're in the middle of an ambush . As you wish . Thanks for the wiskey , as always . Hayyaah ! He 's one I just can 't let go . How come he gets to leave ? It 's not an exact science , here . We 're a bar , after all . But ... William there , could have changed the course of Scottish history . Only , he didn 't ? Willy has free will . - So , ... William could have saved Scotland . What do I do ? - We 're going to figure that out . But , it has to do with that woman . Send me back there then . I can do it differently . Unfortunately , that 's not an option . Now , look , I get that the past is not alterable . But , the furture is not set in stone , either . Right ? Otherwise , you 'd know the outcome already . Doug . - I still have free will . Try your luck . - Your luck is gone . I 'll take my chances . See you around , Doug . Doug Jones ! Open up ! Aaaaah ! So , who did that work out for you ? I didn 't kill that girl . - It doesn 't matter . Your karma has found you . If you run from it , you 're only running in a circle . How do I change it ? What if I stop running ? That 's the first time in 20,000 years a channel has shown that . What does it mean ? - Well , I don 't know . We have to figure out how you are connected to that . So , you guys don 't know everything . Well , obviously not . - Can you understand why it 's hard for me to trust you , then . - Sure . But , can you just concede to the possiblity of not fighting this . You have the opportunity to help a lot of people . So , now I 'm a Boy Scout ? And , two , ... you have a chance to help yourself . You might actually have some fun along the way , too . Bocce ! Loser gets hurled into the cosmos . Just kidding , kidding . Take your turn . Not bad . My turn . Just when you think your actions put you close to something , An unforseen event changes things . Uh , okay . So , now I 'm the ball or what ? Guess my bocce metaphor isn 't as clear as I imagined . No . It 's pretty clear . What the hell am I supposed to do with that information ? Become a , a , kndergarten teacher ? Stop having sex ... save all the puppies of the world ? All good ideas . But , no . You 're a special man , Doug Jones . And , I don 't intend to leave you to face your storm of karma alone . I appreciate that . The universe is inherently meant to be balanced . It always finds a way to restore itself . Okay . So , then where is my rosy future channel ? You know , the one where I make all the right decisions . And , everything turns out great . How much do you remember from last night ? Doug ? - I 'll raise . Damn ! You 're killing me , man . Unbelieveable . Meet me later . How about you , my man ? I 'll call . Have you always been a lucky man , Doug ? Aah , I don 't know if I 'd call it luck . What would you call it then ? Fate , maybe . - Ah , Screw this . There 's a difference . Where 'd you find this guy ? - Just curious . All in . - You are an excellent player . No , I 'm not . It 's skill , not luck . I 'm still trying to assess what it is . - We don 't have all night . Call . Gee ! - Aah ! You stayed in with two 's ? What is this ? - Perhaps it 'll make more sense in the morning . You 're the owner and sole proprietor of Bar Karma , Inc . So , I won this bar from you in the game , last night . Yes . - Why were you there ? You do have incredible luck , Doug . Or , you did . The best news I 've had all day . Doug , this place , Dana and I , we 're part of a company . - By company , he means two misfits in a rundown bar . We 're like a start-up . We broke off to do our own thing . - Who 'd you break off from ? A much larger conglomerate , whom we had a disagreement with , regarding tactics . We have a very specific technique . Patent pending . We help you with the hand you were dealt . Life plays out like a series of scenes . When one scene ends , a million possibilities lay ahead . That is , until they actually happen . That 's your branching event . At that point you 're pretty much stuck with it . All we can change is the future . And , that 's where we come in . - You 're luck is is off the charts . Not that you earned it . Thanks , a lot . - She has a point , you didn 't earn it . If anything , you should have bad luck . Well , maybe it just hasn 't caught up with me yet . Face it , Doug , you 're a once in a millenia cosmic accident . We can use that around here . Show him another scene . ... have your eyes ... Here 's how this could have gone . ( sobbing ) Did that happen ? - I don 't know . Will it happen ? There all just branches , Doug . Just possibilities . Right . If I can 't run from it , and I can 't fight it , might as well fix it . Right . - As well . I get it . I 'm going to help a bunch of sorry sacks who can 't catch a break . And , they might help you . I like it . I do . I thought you would . So , how does this work ? Can I make a request ? I 'd love to get my brother in here and stop him from meeting his wife . She 's a nighmare . - That 's not the way it works . So , how does it work ? - Umm , we wait . For what ? On the next Bar Karma . A fantasy . There 's our destruction . A man in tights destroying the Statue of Liberty . What 's your super power ? Becomes fact . Since when was mass murder an original idea ? - We 're running out of time . Happy Hour does 't last forever . - What kind of game are you playing ? This is crazy . - No . It 's reality .
